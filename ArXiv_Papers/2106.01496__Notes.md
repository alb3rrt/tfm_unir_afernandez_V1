## Abstract

Frei et al. [6] showed that the problem to decide whether a graph is stable with respect to some graph parameter under adding or removing either edges or vertices is $\Theta_2^{\text{P}}$-complete. They studied the common graph parameters $\alpha$ (independence number), $\beta$ (vertex cover number), $\omega$ (clique number), and $\chi$ (chromatic number) for certain variants of the stability problem. We follow their approach and provide a large number of polynomial-time algorithms solving these problems for special graph classes, namely for graphs without edges, complete graphs, paths, trees, forests, bipartite graphs, and co-graphs.
