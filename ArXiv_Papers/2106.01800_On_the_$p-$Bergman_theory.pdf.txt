ABSTRACT. In this paper we attempt to develop a general p-Bergman theory on bounded do-

mains in Cn. To indicate the basic difference between Lp and L2 cases, we show that the

p-Bergman kernel Kp(z) is not real-analytic on some bounded complete Reinhardt domains when p  4 is an even number. By the calculus of variations we get a fundamental reproducing

formula. This together with certain techniques from nonlinear analysis of the p-Laplacian yield

1. INTRODUCTION
In the early twentieth century Stefan Bergman discovered an important link between function theory, geometry and Hilbert space theory, namely the theory of Bergman kernel and Bergman metric. The Bergman theory makes essential use of complete orthonormal bases in the Bergman space, which sheds a particular light on the real difficulty of extending the Bergman theory to the Lp case.
In this paper we attempt to develop a general p-Bergman theory. For a bounded domain   Cn we define Ap() to be the p-Bergman space of Lp holomorphic functions on . We start with a minimizing problem which was also considered by Bergman himself in the case p = 2:

(1.1)

mp(z) := inf { f p : f  Ap(), f (z) = 1} .

There exists at least one minimizer for p > 0 and exactly one minimizer mp(·, z) for every p  1. We then define the p-Bergman kernel by Kp(z) = mp(z)-p for p > 0 and the off-diagonal Bergman kernel by Kp(z, w) = mp(z, w)Kp(w) for p  1. Note that K2(z) and K2(z, w) are standard Bergman kernel and off-diagonal Bergman kernel respectively. After the early work of Narasimhan-Simha [26] and Sakai [30], the study of K2/m(z) for m  Z+ has attracted much attention in recent years (see e.g., [32], [34], [35], [9], [2], [3], [37], [36], [27], [33], [14]).
Our first result will indicate the basic difference between Kp and K2 when p > 2.

Theorem 1.1. Let  be a bounded complete Reinhardt domain in Cn. Then the following prop-
erties hold:
(1) If K2(z, w) is not zero-free, then there exists k0  Z+ such that K2k(z) is not realanalytic on  for any integer k  k0.
(2) Suppose there exist 0, z0   such that K2(0, z0) = 0 and ordz0K2(0, ·) = 1. Then K2k(z) is not real-analytic on  for any integer k  2. Moreover, either Re mp(0, ·) or Im mp(0, ·) is not real-analytic on  for any rational p > 2.

In [25], Lu Qi-Keng asked: for which domains is K2(z, w) zero-free? It turns out that for most pseudoconvex domains K2(z, w) is not zero-free; among them most explicit examples are bounded pseudoconvex complete Reinhardt domains (cf. [6] and [22]). We will verify that the Thullen-type domain {(z1, z2)  C2 : |z1| + |z2|2/ < 1} for  > 2 satisfies the hypothesis in Theorem 1.1/(2) by using the calculation in Boas-Fu-Straube [7].
Note that mp(·, z) and Kp(·, z) are holomorphic on  for fixed z. On the other hand, the function theory of mp(z, ·) or Kp(z, ·) for fixed z is completely mysterious. Using the calculus of variations, we get the following fundamental reproducing formula

(1.2)

f (z) = |mp(·, z)|p-2 Kp(·, z) f,  f  Ap().


The nonlinear factor |mp(·, z)|p-2 causes the real difficulity for applications. Thus the reproducing formula is of limited use without the help of some techniques from nonlinear analysis of the p-Laplacian (cf. [23]). This also indicates the major difference to the Bergman theory.

ON THE p-BERGMAN THEORY

It is fairly easy to show that mp(z) and Kp(z) are locally Lipschitz continuous. However, the regularity problem for mp(z, ·) or Kp(z, ·) is more difficult. Regularity in a minimizing problem is classical and goes back to Hilbert's famous problem-list.

Theorem 1.2. (1) For any p > 1 and any compact set S  , there exists a constant C > 0 such that

|mp(z,

w)

-

mp(z,

w)|



C|w

-

w|

1 2

,

 z, w, w  S.

(2) Let Sw := {m1(·, w) = 0}. For every open set w  U  \Sw, there exists a constant C > 0 such that

|m1(z,

w)

-

m1(z,

w)|



C|w

-

w|

1 2

,

 z, w  U.

The same conclusions also hold for Kp.

Remark. It is interesting to point out that Theorem 1.2 plays an essential role in the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Note that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality gives

|K2(z,

w)|



K2(z)

1 2

K2

(w)

1 2

and

2Re K2(z, w)  K2(z) + K2(w).

Surprisingly, these inequalities remain valid for general p  1.

Theorem 1.3.

where

1/q

=

(2) Re {Kp(z, w) + Kp(w, z)}  Kp(z) + Kp(w).

Each equality holds if and only if z = w.

Remark. In particular, we have |K1(z, w)|  K1(z), so that K1(z, ·) is a bounded function on  for fixed z.

We also investigate the p-Bergman metric given by

Bp(z; X)

:=

Kp

(z

)-

1 p

·

supf

|Xf (z)|

where the supremum is taken over all f  Ap() with f (z) = 0 and f p = 1. It is easy to see that B2(z; X) is the standard Bergman metric. The p-Bergman metric is an invariant (Finsler) metric for simply-connected bounded domains, and is always no less than the Carathéodory
metric C(z; X) (the case p = 2 goes back to Lu Qi-Keng [25]; see also [18]). More interestingly, we have

Proposition 1.4. Bp(z; X)  C(z; X) as p  .

For a real-valued upper semicontinuous function u defined on a domain   Cn, we define the generalized Levi form of u by

i¯u(z;

X)

:=

lim inf r0+

1 r2

1 2

2
u(z + reiX)d - u(z)
0

.

A natural question is to find the relationship between i¯ log Kp(z; X) and Bp(z; X). Using the variation method, we are able to verify the following

p 2(p-1)

Bp(z;

X )2

for p  2

p 2

C

(z;

X

)2

for p  2.

Remark. In particular, log Kp(z) is a (continuous) strictly psh function.

In [37], Yau suggested to investigate the the relationship between the p-Bergman metrics when p changes. Motivated by the spectrum theory of the p-Laplacian (cf. [24]), we will show

Theorem 1.6. (1) limsp- ms(z, w) = mp(z, w) for p > 1 and limsp+ ms(z, w) exists for p  1. Moreover, if Ap() lies dense in Ap() for some p > p, then

mp(z,

w)

=

lim
sp+

ms(z,

w).

(2) limsp± Bs(z; X) exist for p > 0 and Bp(z; X) = limsp- Bs(z; X). Moreover, if there exists p > p such that Ap() lies dense in Ap(), then

Bp(z;

X)

=

lim
sp

Bs(z;

X ).

Conclusion (1) also holds for Kp.

On the other hand, we have

Proposition 1.7. Let  = D\S where D is a bounded domain in C and S is a compact set in D which has positive 2-capacity but zero p-capacity for every p < 2. Then

K2(z)

>

lim
p2+

Kp(z).

Recall that the p-capacity of S is given by Capp(S) := inf C ||p where the infimum is taken over all   C0(C) such that   1 on S. The condition of Proposition 1.7 is satisfied for instance, if the h-Hausdorff measure h(S) of S is positive and finite where h(t) = (log 1/t)- for some  > 1.
Due to the failure of Lp-estimates for ¯ on general pseudoconvex domains when p > 2 (compare [17]), it is plausible to study the boundary behavior of Kp(z) through comparison with K2(z). With the help of L2 estimates for ¯, we are able to show the following

Theorem 1.8. Let  be a bounded pseudoconvex domain with C2-boundary and  denotes the boundary distance. Then the following properties hold:

(1) There exist constants , C > 0 such that the following estimates hold near  :

It is a straightforward consequence of the Ohsawa-Takegoshi extension theorem [29] that K2(z) -2 holds for bounded pseudoconvex domains with C2-boundary. Thus

Remark. It was shown in [27] that Kp(z) is an exhaustion function for any 0 < p < 2 and any bounded pseudoconvex domain.

It is reasonable to ask the following

Problem 1. Is Kp(z) an exhaustion function for any p > 2?
Remark. The answer is affirmative when  is a simply-connected uniformly squeenzing domain or smooth strictly pseudoconvex domain (cf. [14]).
Most results in this paper extend to the p-Bergman space related to Hermitian line bundles over complex manifolds. Nevertheless, we stick to the simplest case of bounded domains with trivial line bundle in order to make the arguments as transparent as possible.

2. DEFINITIONS AND BASIC PROPERTIES 2.1. The p-Bergman space. For a domain   Cn we define the p-Bergman space to be

Ap() :=

f  O() :

|f |p <  .



Proposition 2.1 (Bergman inequality). For any compact set S   there exists a constant CS > 0 such that

(2.1)

sup |f |p  CS f pp. S

Proof. Set r = d(S, ). For any z  S, we have P (z, r/n) := follows directly from the mean-value inequality of psh functions that

Proposition 2.2. Ap() is a Banach space for p  1.

Proof. It suffices to verify that Ap() is a closed subspace in Lp(). Let {fj}  Ap() satisfy fj  f0 in Lp(). By (2.1) we known that {fj} forms a normal family so that there exists a subsequence fjk converging locally uniformly to some f^0  O(). Fatou's lemma yields

fjm - f0 p] =

which implies that f^0  Ap() and fjk  f^0 in Lp(). Thus f0 = f^0 holds a.e. on .

Remark. Analogously, one can show that Ap() is a complete metric space for 0 < p < 1, where the metric is given by d(f1, f2) := f1 - f2 pp.

2.2. A minimizing problem. For a bounded domain in   Cn, we consider the following minimizing problem:

(2.3)

mp(z) = m,p(z) = inf { f p : f  Ap(), f (z) = 1} .

Proposition 2.3 (Existence). There exists at least one minimizer in (2.3).

Proof. Take {fj}  Ap() such that fj(z) = 1 and fj p  mp(z) as j  . The Bergman inequality implies that {fj} is a normal family so that there exists a subsequence {fjk} which converges locally uniformly to some f0  O(). By Fatou's lemma, we have



|f0|p



lim inf k

|fjk |p = mp(z)p.


On the other hand, since fj(z) = 1, we have f0(z) = 1 and f0 p = mp(z), i.e., f0 is a minimizer.

Proposition 2.4 (Uniqueness). For p  1 there is only one minimizer in (2.3).

Proof. Let f1, f2 be two minimizers and satisfies h(z) = 1. Note that

of

(2.3).

We

take

h

Clearly,

h

and equality holds only when a1 = a2. It follows that if f1 = f2 then

which is absurd.

|f1|p 


|h|p <




|f1|p

+ 2

|f2|p

=

mp(z)p,

Remark. It is not known whether the uniqueness result holds for 0 < p < 1.

Let mp(·, z) denote a minimizer in (2.3) (one warning: mp(z, z) = 1 = mp(z)!).

Definition 2.1. We call Kp(z) := mp(z)-p the p-Bergman kernel for p > 0 and Kp(z, w) := mp(z, w)Kp(w) the off-diagonal p-Bergman kernel for p  1.

Proposition 2.5. For every p > 0 we have

(2.4)

Kp(z) = sup {|f (z)|p : f  Ap(), f p = 1} .

Proof. Take f0  Ap() with f0(z) = 1 and f0 p = mp(z). We have

sup
f Ap()

|f (z)|p

f

p p



|f0(z)|p

f0

p p

=

mp(z)-p

=

Kp(z).

On the other hand, for f  Ap() with f p = 1 we see that f^ := f /f (z)  Ap() satisfies f^(z) = 1. It follows that

mp(z)  f^ p = 1/|f (z)|, i.e., |f (z)|p  mp(z)-p = Kp(z).

in view of (2.2), where  =  denotes the boundary distance. Let us present a few elementary properties (some of them are known).

Proposition 2.6 (Transformation rule). Let F : 1  2 be a biholomorphic mapping between bounded simply-connected domains. Let JF denote the complex Jacobian of F . Then

(2.6) (2.7) (2.8) (2.9)

m1,p(z) = m2,p(F (z))|JF (z)|-2/p, p > 0,

K1,p(z) = K2,p(F (z))|JF (z)|2, p > 0,

Moreover, equalities hold for arbitrary bounded domains when 2/p  Z+.

Proof. Since

|f2|p = |f2  F |p|JF |2,

2

we conclude that f2  Ap(2) if and only if f1 := f2  F · JF2/p  Ap(1) (only here we have to use the assumption that 1 is simply-connected). If f2(F (z)) = 1, then f1(z)JF (z)-2/p = 1, so that

m1,p(z)p  |JF (z)|-2

|f1|p = |JF (z)|-2

|f2|p.

Take minimum over f2, we get

m1,p(z)p  |JF (z)|-2m2,p(F (z))p.

Consider F -1 instead of F , we get the inverse inequality in (2.6). Next, we define for fixed w  1, a holomorphic function by

f1(z)

:=

m2,p(F

(z),

F

(z)

Clearly, we have f1(w) = 1 and

in view of (2.6). (2.8) follows immediately from Proposition 2.4.

The remaining equalities follow from the relations

Kp(z) = mp(z)-p and Kp(z, w) = mp(z, w)Kp(z).

Remark. The simply-connected hypothesis can not be removed (see [27], Remark 2.3).

Proposition 2.7 (Product rule). Let  and  be bounded domains in Cn and Cm respectively. Set  =  ×  and z = (z, z). Then we have
m,p(z) = m,p(z) · m,p(z), p > 0, m,p(z, w) = m, p(z, w) · m, p(z, w), p  1.
The same conclusions also hold for Kp.
Proof. For fixed z   and z   we take f1  Ap() and f2  Ap() such that f1(z) = f2(z) = 1 and
m,p(z) = f1 p, m,p(z) = f2 p. Fubini's theorem gives

|f1()f2()|p =

f1

p p

·

f2

p p

=

m,p(z)p

·

m,p(z)p.

 

Thus

m,p(z)  m,p(z) · m,p(z).

On the other hand, for every h  Ap() we have

|h(z, z)|p  K,p(z) · |h(·, z)|p


 K,p(z) · K,p(z) ·

so that K,p(z)  K,p(z) · K,p(z).
Since Kp(z) = mp(z)-p, the first equality follows immediately. Next, we note that for fixed w   the function

|h|p,


f0(z) := m, p(z, w) · m, p(z, w)

is holomorphic on  and satisfies f0(w) = 1,

|f0|p =

|m, p(·, w)|p |m, p(·, w)|p







= m, p(w)p m, p(w)p

= m,p(w)p.

By uniqueness of the minimizer we immediately get the the second equality.

Proposition 2.10. (1) Both mp(z) and Kp(z) are locally Lipschitz continuous for p > 0. (2) Both mp(z, w) and Kp(z, w) are continuous in (z, w) for p  1.

Proof. (1) Let S be a compact set in  and z  S. Take f  Ap() with f p = 1 such that |f (z)|p = Kp(z). It follows from Cauchy's estimates that for any w  S,

Kp(z)1/p = |f (z)|  |f (w)| + CS|z - w|  Kp(w)1/p + CS|z - w|,

i.e., Kp(z)1/p is locally Lipschitz continuous in z, so are Kp(z) and mp(z). (2) It suffices to verify continuity of mp(z, w). Let z0, w0   be fixed. We first verify that

so {mp(·, wj)} forms a normal family so that there exists a subsequence {mp(·, wjk)} converging locally uniformly to a function f0  O(). Fatou's lemma yields

Since the sequence {wj} can be chosen arbitrarily, we get (2.12). Finally,

|mp(z, w) - mp(z0, w0)|  |mp(z, w) - mp(z0, w)| + |mp(z0, w) - mp(z0, w0)|  C0|||z - z0| + |mp(z0, w) - mp(z0, w0)| 0

as z  z0 and w  w0.

2.3. A reproducing formula. Throughout this subsection we always assume that p  1. Lemma 2.11. For any f  Ap() with f (z) = 0, we have

(2.13)

|mp(·, z)|p-2 mp(·, z) f = 0.



Proof. We will use the calculus of variations. For fixed f we consider the family

ft = mp(·, z) + tf  Ap(), t  C.

Since ft(z) = 1, we see that the function J(t) :=

ft

p p

the

Rewrite

i.e., (2.13) holds.

Now we reach the following fundamental fact.

Theorem 2.12 (Reproducing formula). For any f  Ap() we have

(2.14)

f (z) = mp(z)-p |mp(·, z)|p-2 mp(·, z) f = |mp(·, z)|p-2 Kp(·, z) f.





Proof. Let f  Ap(). With f replaced by f - f (z) in (2.13), we obtain

(2.15)

|mp(·, z)|p-2 mp(·, z) f = f (z) · |mp(·, z)|p-2 mp(·, z).





Substitute f = mp(·, z) into (2.15), we obtain

mp(z)p = |mp(·, z)|p-2 mp(·, z).

This combined with (2.15) yields (2.14).

Let us present a few simple consequences of Theorem 2.12.

Proposition 2.13. Given two distinct points z, w  , mp(·, z) and mp(·, w) are not parallel, i.e., mp(·, z) = cmp(·, w) for any c  C.
Proof. Suppose on the contrary that mp(·, z) = cmp(·, w) for some complex number c. It follows from Theorem 2.12 that for any f  Ap(),

f (z) = mp(z)-p |mp(·, z)|p-2 mp(·, z) f


On the other hand,

= mp(z)-p|c|p-2c¯ |mp(·, w)|p-2 mp(·, w) f

= [mp(w)/mp(z)]p |c|p-2c¯f (w).

mp(z)p = |mp(·, z)|p = |c|p |mp(·, w)|p = |c|pmp(w)p.





Thus we have f (z) = f (w)/c. But this is absurd since one can choose f  Ap() with f (z) = 0

and f (w) = 0.

Problem 2. Let w1, · · · , wm be different points in . Is it possible to conclude that mp(·, w1), · · · , mp(·, wm) are linearly independent?

Proposition 2.14. We have

(2.16)

|mp(z, w)|  mp(w)/mp(z)

and equality holds if and only if z = w. Equivalently,

(2.17)

|Kp(z,

w)|



Kp(z)

1 p

Kp(w)

1 q

where

1 p

+

1 q

=

1,

and

equality

holds

if

and

only

if

z

=

w.

Proof. Substitute f = mp(·, w) into (2.14), we obtain

|mp(z, w)| = mp(z)-p |mp(·, z)|p-2 mp(·, z) mp(·, w)

 mp(z)-pmp(z)p-1mp(w) (Hölder's inequality)

= mp(w)/mp(z).

Clearly, equality holds if z = w. On the other hand, if equality in (2.16) holds then there exists r > 0 such that

(2.18)

|mp(·, w)|p = r

|mp(·, z)|p-2|mp(·, z)|

p p-1

=

r|mp(·, z)|p.

Set h := mp(·, z)/mp(·, w) and Sw := {mp(·, w) = 0}. Since mp(w, w) = 1, it follows that Sw is an analytic hypersurface of  and h is holomorphic on \Sw. By (2.18), we see that |h| is a constant on \Sw. Thus h has to be a constant, i.e., mp(·, z) = cmp(·, w) for some complex number c on \Sw. By continuity, the same equality holds on , so that z = w in view of Proposition 2.13.

ON THE p-BERGMAN THEORY

Proposition 2.15. For fixed z  , mp(z, ·) = const.

Proof. Note that

|mp(z,

w)|



mp(w)/mp(z)

=

Kp(w)-

1 p

mp(z)-1.

Since  is bounded, there exists a ball B   such that   B = . For any w0    B, we have

K,p(w)  KB,p(w)   (w  w0),

which implies mp(z, w)  0 as w  w0. On the other hand, we have mp(z, z) = 1. Thus mp(z, ·) = const.

Problem 3. Is it possible to conclude that mp(z, ·) can not be locally constant?

2.4. An application to properly discontinuous groups. For a domain   Cn we denote by Aut() the group of holomorphic automorphisms of . A subgroup G of Aut() is said to be properly discontinuous if for every compact set S   there are only a finite number of elements g  G with S  g(S) = . A well-known result of H. Cartan states that /G is a complex space if G is properly discontinuous.
Let L(Gz) denote the set of limit points of Gz := {g(z) : g  G}. Set

L(G) := L(Gz).
zG
Since G is properly discontinuous, we have L(G)  .

Proposition 2.16. Let   Cn be a bounded simply-connected domain and G  Aut() a properly discontinuous group. For any 0 < p <  and any w  L(G), there exists f  Ap() such that
lim sup |f (z)| = .
zw
Proof. By a classical result of Poincaré-Siegel (cf. [31]) we know that

(2.19)

|Jg(z)|2 < ,  z  .

gG

Take z0   and {gj}   such that zj := gj(z0)  w. By Proposition 2.6 we have

Kp(z0) = Kp(zj)|Jgj (z0)|2,

so that

 j=1

Kp(z0) Kp (zj )

|Jgj (z)|2

Suppose on the contrary that

supj |f (zj)| < ,  f  Ap().

14

BO-YONG CHEN AND LIYOU ZHANG

By the Bergman inequality, we see that the continuous linear functional

Fj : f  Ap()  f (zj)

satisfies supj |Fj(f )| < , so that supj Fj <  in view of the Banach-Steinhaus theorem.

Since

Fj

=

sup
f Ap()

|f (zj)| fp

=

Kp(zj )1/p,

we obtain supj Kp(zj) < , a contradiction!

Corollary 2.17. For any neighborhood U of w  L(G), the Hausdorff dimension of   U is no less than 2n - 1.

Proof. Suppose on the contrary that there exist  < 2n - 1 and a neighborhood U of w such that

(  U) = 0, where  means the -dimensional Hausdorff measure. It follows that   U is a polar set, so that D := U \ is connected and D  . Since KD,p(z)  K,p(z) for z  D, we infer from the proof of Proposition 2.16 that

lim sup KD,p(z) = ,  0 < p < . zw

On the other hand, thanks to a theorem on removable singularity due to Harvey-Polking [19], we

have

Ap(D)

for

p

,

so

that

lim sup KD,p(z) < , zw

a contradiction!

Let w  L(G). We would like to ask the following

Problem 4. Does there exist f  A() which can not be extended holomorphically across w?

Problem 5. Is it possible to conclude that 2n-1(  U) > 0 for any neighborhood U of w?

2.5. The p-Bergman metric. For X = j Xj/zj we define the p-Bergman metric to be

(2.20)

Bp(z; X)

:=

Kp

(z

)-

1 p

·

supf

|Xf (z)|

where the supremum is taken over all f  Ap() with f (z) = 0 and f p = 1. Note that B2(z; X) is the standard Bergman metric. A normal family argument shows that the "sup" in (2.20) can be replaced by "max". For the sake of convenience, we set

(2.21)

Mp(z; X) := sup {|Xf (z)| : f  Ap(), f (z) = 0, f p = 1}

and define Mp(·, z; X) to be the maximizer of (2.21), i.e., M,p(z; X) = XMp(·, z; X)|z.

Proposition 2.18. Let F : 1  2 be a biholomorphic mapping between bounded simplyconnected domains. Then

(2.22)

B1,p(z; X) = B2,p(F (z); FX).

Moreover, (2.22) holds for arbitrary bounded domains whenever 2/p  Z+.

ON THE p-BERGMAN THEORY

15

Proof. By Proposition 2.6 it suffices to verify

M1,p(z; X) = M2,p(F (z); FX)|JF (z)|2/p. If f2 is a test function for M2,p(F (z); FX), then f1 := f2  F · JF2/p is a test function for M1,p(z; X). Then we have
|X(f2  F )(z) · JF (z)2/p| = |Xf1(z)|  M1,p(z; X). Take supremum over f2  Ap(2), we get

M2,p(F (z); FX)|JF (z)|2/p  M1,p(z; X). Consider F -1 instead of F , we get the inverse inequality.

Proposition 2.19. For the unit ball Bn  Cn we have

(2.23)

Bp(z; X) = cn,p

|X |2 1 - |z|2

+

n j=1

where

cn,p

sup

|f (0)| : f  Ap(Bn) . z1f p

Proof. For z  Bn we take an automorphism F of Bn such that F (z) = 0. By (2.22), we have

Bp(z; X) B2(z; X)

=

Bp(0; B2(0;

FX FX

) )

.

It suffices to compute the ratio Bp(0; X)/B2(0; X). After a unitary transformation, we may assume X = |X|/z1. Since every f  O() with f (0) = 0 admits a decomposition f (z) =
j zjfj(z) for certain fj  O(), we obtain

Bp(0; X) =

|X |

Kp(0)

Since

we

obtain

(2.23).

Problem 6. What is the product rule for Bp? Recall that the Carathéodory metric is defined by

C(z; X) = C(z; X) := sup {|Xf (z)| : f  A(), f (z) = 0, f  = 1} .

Proposition 2.20. Bp(z; X)  C(z; X). Proof. Take h  Ap() and f  A() with f (z) = 0 and f  = 1. Set g = f · h. Then we have g(z) = 0, g p  h p and

|Xg(z)| = |Xf (z)| · |h(z)|,

so that

Mp(z; X)



|X g (z)| gp



|Xf (z)|

·

|h(z)| hp

.

Take supremum over f and h, we immediately get the desired conclusion.

Remark. We may define the (p, q)-Bergman metric by

supf

where the supremum is taken over all f  Ap() with f (z) = 0 and f p = 1. Analogously, we may verify that

B1,p,q(z; X) = B2,p,q(F (z); FX) for any biholomorphic mapping F : 1  2 between bounded simply-connected domains.

Proof. It suffices to verify (3.1). Take two holomorphic functions fp and fq on  with fp(z) = fq(z) = 1 and
fp p = mp(z), fq q = mq(z). Set fr := fpfq. Then fr is a holomorphic function on  satisfying fr(z) = 1 and Hölder's inequality gives
f r  fp p · fq q = mp(z) · mq(z). By definition of mr(z) we immediately get (3.1).

ON THE p-BERGMAN THEORY

17

Proposition 3.2. Let p  1 and k  Z+. We have Kp(z) = Kpk(z) if and only if mp(·, z) = mpk(·, z)k.

Proof. Suppose Kp(z) = Kpk(z). Since fk := mpk(·, z)k is a holomorphic function satisfying fk(z) = 1 and

|fk|p = |mpk(·, z)|pk = mpk(z)pk = mp(z)p,





it follows from uniqueness of the minimizer that fk = mp(·, z). The other direction follows from

mp(z)p = |mp(·, z)|p = |mpk(·, z)|pk = mpk(z)pk.





Proposition 3.3. Suppose that  is a bounded simply-connected domain in Cn and mp(·, z) is zero-free for some p  1 and z  . Then

(1) Ks(z) = Kp(z) for any s  p. (2) ms(·, z) = mp(·, z)p/s for any s  p.

Proof.

|fp,s|s = mp(z)p = ms(z)s.

Uniqueness of the minimizer gives fp,s = ms(·, z).

An immediate consequence is
Corollary 3.4. Let  be a bounded simply-connected domain. If Kp(z) = K2(z) for some p > 2 and z  , then K2(·, z) has zeroes.

18

BO-YONG CHEN AND LIYOU ZHANG

For a bounded domain   Cn we set

F () := {z   : K2(·, z) is zero-free} and N () := \F (). Since K2(, z) = K2(z, ), we conclude that if K2(, z) = 0 then , z  N ().

Proposition 3.5. F () is a closed subset and N () is an open subset.

Proof. Suppose on the contrary that N () is not open, i.e., there exist z0  N () and a sequence of points {zj}  F () such that zj  z0 as j  . Since K2(·, zj)  K2(·, z0), it follows from Hurwitz's theorem that either z0  F () or K2(·, z0)  0. The latter can not happen since K2(z0, z0) > 0. Thus we get a contradiction.
For a set E we denote by E the set of inner points of E. Then we have

Theorem 3.6. Let  be a bounded simply-connected domain in Cn such that both N () and F () are nonempty. Then the following properties hold:
(1) There exists k0  Z+ such that K2k(z) is not real-analytic in  for any integer k  k0. (2) Suppose furthermore that there exists 0, z0  N () with ordz0K2(0, ·) = 1. Then
K2k(z) is not real-analytic in  for any integer k  2. Moreover, either Re mp(0, ·) or Im mp(0, ·) cannot be real-analytic in  for any rational p > 2.
Proof. (1) By Proposition 3.3, we have K2k(z) = K2(z) for any z  F (). Suppose on the contrary that K2k(z) is real-analytic in . Then K2k(z) = K2(z) for any z   by the uniqueness theorem for real-analytic functions since F () = . It then follows from Proposition 3.2 that

(3.4)

m2(·, z) = m2k(·, z)k,  z  .

Take 0, z0  N () so that K2(0, z0) = 0. Then m2(0, z0) = 0, which implies m2k(0, z0) = 0.

Set k0 := ordz0K2(0, ·) = ordz0m2(0, ·). Since K2(0, ·) is holomorphic and not identically

zero, we Theorem

conclude 4.7 in the

k0 < . Since m2k(0, section, we see that for k

21+-1H, ölder

in

view

of

ordz0m2(0, ·) < ordz0m2k(0, ·)k,

which is contradictory to (3.4).

(2) For any k > 2, we have

ordz0m2(0, ·) = 1 < ordz0m2k(0, ·)k,
so that the first assertion follows analogously as (1). For the second assertion we write p = k/l for k, l  Z+. By Proposition 3.3, we have Kp(z) = K2(z) and mp(0, z)k = m2(0, z)2l for any z  F (). Suppose on the other contrary that both Re mp(0, ·) and Im mp(0, ·) are real-analytic in . Since F () = , it follows from the uniqueness theorem for real-analytic fucntions that
mp(0, z)k = m2(0, z)2l,  z  .
On the other hand, we have

ordz0m2(0, ·)2l = 2l < k  ordz0m2k(0, ·)k since m2k(0, ·) is real-analytic, which is a contradiction.

ON THE p-BERGMAN THEORY

Remark. Actually we have proved a stronger conclusion that K2k(z) - K2(z) does not enjoy the unique continuation property, i.e., it vanishes identically if it vanishes on a nonempty open subset. There are plenty of non real-analytic functions which still verify the unique continuation property.

Proposition 3.7. Let  be a bounded complete Reinhardt domain in Cn. Then there exists  > 0 such that
B(0) := {z  Cn : |z| < }  F ().

Proof. Note that

K2(z, w) = azw¯, a = 1/ |z|2.





Take r  1 so that Br(0)  . The series expansion above implies that

K2(z, w) = K2(rz, w/r),  z  , w  Br2(0)
(this observation is essentially due to S. R. Bell). Thus for r  1 there exists a constant Cr > 0 such that
|K2(z, w)|  Cr,  z  , w  Br2(0), and Cauchy's estimates gives

|K2(z, 0) - K2(z, w)|  Cr|w|,  z  , w  Br2/2(0). Since K2(z, 0) = 1/||, it follows that if  is sufficiently small then K2(z, w) = 0 for all z   and w  B(0), i.e., B(0)  F ().

Remark. Since complete Reinhardt domains are always simply-connected, we see that Theorem 1.1 follows from Theorem 3.6 and Proposition 3.7.

Finally we will show that the following Thullen-type domain

 = (z1, z2) : |z1| + |z2|2/ < 1 verifies the hypothesis of Theorem 3.6/(2) for every  > 2. It is known from (9) in [7] that

4. HÖLDER CONTINUITY OF mp(z, ·) AND Kp(z, ·) Throughout this section we always assume that p  1. Let us introduce a useful auxiliary function as follows
Hp(z, w) := Kp(z) + Kp(w) - Re {Kp(z, w) + Kp(w, z)} . Clearly, Hp(z, w) = Hp(w, z) and Hp(z, z) = 0. Moreover, we have
Proposition 4.1. For every compact set S  , there exists a constant C > 0 such that |Hp(z, w)|  C|z - w|,  z, w  S.
Proof. It suffices to verify |Kp(z, w) - Kp(w)|  C|z - w|,  z, w  S.
This follows from the fact that Kp(·, w) is holomorphic and uniformly bounded in a small neighborhood of S in view of (2.17).
A less obvious observation is

Theorem 4.2. We have Hp(z, w)  0 and equality holds if and only if z = w.
For the proof of Theorem 4.2 and the regularity results in the sequel, the following "elementary" inequalities play a key role.

where the first equality follows from the reproducing formula. Since

Proof. It suffices to take b = mp(·, w), a = mp(·, w) in (4.2) with p = 1, then take integration over .

Proof of Theorem 4.2. Lemma 4.44.6 give Hp(z, w)  0. Now suppose Hp(z, w) = 0. It follows from Lemma 4.4 and Lemma 4.5 that mp(·, z) = mp(·, w) whenever p > 1, so that z = w in view of Proposition 2.13. It remains to deal with the case p = 1. Consider the following proper analytic subset in 

Sz,w := {mp(·, z) = 0}  {mp(·, w) = 0}. Let V  U  \Sz,w be two open sets. We take
h := m1(·, z)/m1(·, w)  O(U ).
Since |Im h|2 is subharmonic on U, it follows from the mean-value inequality and Lemma 4.6 that for every   V

|Im h()|2

|Im h|2 = |Im{m1(·, z)m1(·, w)}|2|m1(·, w)|-4

ON THE p-BERGMAN THEORY

23

Since V and U can be arbitrarily chosen, we conclude that Im h = 0 on the domain \Sz,w, so that h = const., i.e., mp(·, z) = cmp(·, w) holds on \Sz,w for some complex number c. By continuity, the same equality remains valid on , so that z = w in view of Proposition 2.13.

Theorem 4.7. For any p > 1 and any compact set S  , there exists a constant C > 0 such that

The same conclusion also holds for Kp.

Proof. It suffices to verify the conclusion for mp(z, w) since Kp(z, w) = mp(z, w)Kp(w) and Kp(z) is locally Lipschitz continuous. Lemma 4.5 together with Proposition 4.1 immediately yield (4.10) for 1 < p  2. Analogously, Lemma 4.4 combined with Proposition 4.1 gives

|mp(z, w) - mp(z, w)|

|w

-

w|

1 p

for p > 2, which is weaker than (4.10), however. We have to adopt another approach. Substitute at first a = mp(·, w) and b = mp(·, w) into (4.1) then take integration over , we obtain

(|mp(·, w)|p-2

which implies

|mp(·, w)|p-2|mp(·, w) - mp(·, w)|2 |w - w|.

Now fix an open set U with S  U  . Since {mp(·, w) : w  S} is a continuous family of holomorphic functions on  (in view of Proposition 2.10), it follows from the celebrated theorem of Demailly-Kollár [13] on semi-continuity of the complex singularity exponent that there exist positive constants c = c(S) and M = M(S) such that

5. Bp(z; X) AND i¯ log Kp(z; X)

i¯u(z;

X)

:=

where we identify X = j Xj/zj with (X1, · · · , Xn) for the sake of simplicity. Note that if u is C2 then i¯u(z; X) is the standard Levi form of u.

Theorem 5.1. For every p  2 we have

(5.1)

We need the following simple fact.

Lemma 5.2. For every p > 0 we have

(5.2)

|mp(·, z)|pf = 0


for all f  A() with f (z) = 0 and f  = 1.

Proof. Given f  A() with f (z) = 0 and f  = 1, we define

ft = mp(·, z)(1 + tf ), t  C.

Clearly, ft belongs to Ap() and satisfies ft(z) = 1. We then have

mp(z)p 

p
|ft|p = |mp(·, z)|p 1 + 2Re{tf } + |t|2|f |2 2





= |mp(·, z)|p 1 + pRe{tf } + O(|t|2)


= mp(z)p + pRe t |mp(·, z)|pf + O(|t|2)


as t  0. Take t = se-i arg  |mp(·,z)|pf with s  R, we immediately get (5.2).

Proof of Theorem 5.1. Fix r > 0 and   R for a moment. For t  C with |t| = O(r) and f  A() with f (z) = 0 and f  = 1 we define ft = mp(·, z)(1 + tf ) as above. We have
|ft(z + reiX)|p = |mp(z + reiX, z)|p|1 + tf (z + reiX)|p = |mp(z + reiX, z)|p|1 + treiXf (z) + O(r3)|p = |mp(z + reiX, z)|p 1 + pRe treiXf (z) + O(r3)

Let E be a compact set in C. Let O(E) be the set of functions which are holomorphic in a neighborhood of E and Lpa(E) the set of functions in Lp(E) which are holomorphic in E. It is well-known [20] that O(E) lies dense in Lpa(E) for p  [1, 2). Since O(E)  As(E) for every s > 0, we have
Corollary 6.3. If  is a bounded fat domain in C, i.e.,  = , then (6.2) holds for p  [1, 2).

The following proposition can be used to produce plenty of examples with

Kp(z).

Proposition 6.4. Let  = D\S where D is a bounded domain in C and S is a compact set in D which has positive 2-capacity but zero p-capacity for every p < 2. Then (6.4) holds.

Recall that the p-capacity of S is given by

Capp(S)

:=

inf 

||p
C

where the infimum is taken over all   C0(C) such that   1 on S. The condition of Proposition 6.4 is satisfied for instance, if the h-Hausdorff measure h(S) of S is positive and finite where h(t) = (log 1/t)- for some  > 1.

Proof of Proposition 6.4. It is a classical result that Ap() = Ap(D) if and only if Capq(S) = 0

where

(cf.

and

Hence

K,p(z) = KD,p(z)  Cnd(S, D)-2n

for all z   with d(z, S)  d(S, D)/2. On the other hand, since Cap2(S) > 0, i.e., S is non-polar, so there exists a regular point a  S for the Dirichlet problem on . Then we have

The same conclusions also hold for Kp.

Proof. (1) We first consider the case p > 2. Fix 2 < s < p. Apply (4.3) with a = ms(·, w), b = mp(·, w), and p replaced by s, we obtain

Thus we have

(2) We first consider the case p  2. Let p  s < r. Apply (4.3) with a = ms(·, w), b = mr(·, w), and p replaced by s, we obtain

Thus we have

Since limsp+ ms(w) exists, it follows that {ms(z, w)} forms a Cauchy family as s  p+, so that limsp+ ms(z, w) also exists.
Next suppose 1 < p < 2. Let p  s < r < 2. Take f2 = mr(·, w) and f1 = ms(·, w) in (6.7), we obtain

Since {mr(·, w)}r and {ms(·, w)}s are normal families, there exist subsequences {mrj (·, w)} and {msj (·, w)} which converge locally uniformly to certain holomorphic functions h1 and h2 respectively. Clearly, we have h1(w) = h2(w) = 1.
For fixed w we set Sw := h-1 1(0)  h-2 1(0). For any open sets V  U  \Sw there exists a constant C  1 such that

In general, we consider two arbitrary convergent subsequences {mrj1(·, w)} and {mrj2(·, w)} of {mr(·, w)}r. Let {sj} be a subsequence of {rj2} with sj < rj1. By the above argument we know that the sequences {mrj1(·, w)} and {msj (·, w)} has the same limit, which is also the limit of {mrj2(·, w)}. Thus limp1+ mp(z, w) exists.

If Ap() lies dense in Ap() for some p > p, then we have mp(w) = limsp mp(w). Thus

(6.8) together with (6.9) yield (6.6) for p > 1. Apply (6.10) with s = 1 in a similar way as above,

we obtain (6.6) for p = 1.

Corollary 6.6. Let  be a bounded domain with positive hyperconvexity index. If K2(·, w) is not zero-free for some w  , then there exists a number  = (w) > 0 such that Kp(·, w) is also not zero-free for p  (2 - , 2 + ).
Proof. Suppose on the contrary that there exists a sequence pj  2 such that Kpj (·, w) is zerofree for all j. It follows from Theorem 6.5 and Hurwitz's theorem that K2(·, w)  0, which is clearly impossible.

Proposition 6.7. (1) limsp± Bs(z; X) exists for p > 0 and

(6.11)

Bp(z;

Bs(z;

(2) If there exists p > p such that Ap() lies dense in Ap(), then

(6.12)

Proof. (1) Similar as the proof of Proposition 6.1, we have

||

(2) Suppose that Ap() lies dense in Ap() for some p > p. We may choose a sequence fj of functions in Ap() such that

7. COMPARISON OF Kp(z) AND K2(z)

where g(, z) is the pluricomplex Green function defined by

g(, z) = sup u() : u  P SH-() and u()  log | - z| + O(1) near z .

Note that g(·, z) is a continuous negative psh function on \{z} which satisfies

(7.4)

- i¯ log(-g(·, z))  i log(-g(·, z))  ¯ log(-g(·, z))

as currents. For p > 2 and z   we take f  Ap() with

Let

v := f ¯(- log(-g(·, z))).

By (7.4) we have

iv¯  v  |f |2|(- log(-g(·, z)))|2 · -i¯ log(-g(·, z)) .

The Donnelly-Fefferman estimate (cf. [16], see also [1], [5]) then yields a solution of the equation ¯u = v (in the sense of distributions) such that

then solve the equation

8. CONCLUDING REMARKS
There are two interesting functions related to the limiting case p = 0. The first one, which is introduced by Tsuji [36], is defined to be

K0(z) := lim sup K2/m(z) m
where (·) denotes the upper semicontinuous regularization. The second one, which arises from Siu's work on invariance of plurigenera [32], is defined by

K0(z) := mK2/m(z)
m=1
where {m} is a sequence of positive numbers satisfying m < . By (2.5) we see that both K0 and K0 are well-defined so that log K0 and log K0 are psh on ; moreover, K0 always dominates K0 while the latter is continuous. By Proposition 2.6 we immediately obtain
K1,0(z) = K2,0(F (z))|JF (z)|2 K1,0(z) = K2,0(F (z))|JF (z)|2
for any biholomorphic mapping F : 1  2.

ON THE p-BERGMAN THEORY

39

The functions K2/m(z) (m  Z+) , K0(z) and K0(z) can be used to produce various invariant Kähler metrics. Following Narasimhan-Simha [26], we introduce the following weighted Bergman space

A2p() := f  O() : |f |2/Kp <  . 
Let K2,p(z) denote the Bergman kernel associated to A2p(). Then

ds22/m

:=

n j,k=1

2

log K2,2/m(z) zj z¯k

dzj



dz¯k

gives an invariant Kähler metric on  (cf. [30]; see also [9]). Analogously, we may introduce the following weighted Bergman spaces

A20() := f  O() : |f |2/K0 <  

A20() := f  O() : |f |2/K0 <  . 

Let K2,0(z) (resp. K2,0(z)) denote the Bergman kernel associated to A20() (resp. A20()). It is not difficult to see that

ds20

:=

n j,k=1

are invariant Kähler metrics on .

Problem 10. Is it possible to construct an invariant complete metric on any bounded pseudoconvex domain by using the p-Bergman kernel?

It is also valuable to study the following high order minimizing problem:

m(p)(z) := sup f p : f  Ap(), ()f (z) = 1 and ()f (z) = 0,    
where for  = (1, · · · , n) and  = (1, · · · , n) we define     || < || or || = || and j = j for j < k while k > k. Analogously, one can show that there exists exactly one minimizer m(p)(·, z) for p  1, and many properties of mp(·, z) extend to m(p)(·, z). An elegant observation due to Bergman states that for every z  , {m(2)(·, z)/ m(2)(·, z) 2} is a complete orthonormal basis of A2().

Problem 11. Does {m(p)(·, z)/ m(p)(·, z) p} form a Schauder basis of Ap()?

(|b|p-2 + |a|p-2)|b - a|2 = |b|p + |a|p + |b|p-2|a|2 + |a|p-2|b|2 -2Re(|b|p-2¯ba) - 2Re(|a|p-2a¯b)
(|b|p-2 - |a|p-2)(|b|2 - |a|2) = |b|p + |a|p - |b|p-2|a|2 - |a|p-2|b|2.

Summing up, we obtain the following basic equality:

(9.1)

(|b|p-2 + |a|p-2)|b - a|2 + (|b|p-2 - |a|p-2)(|b|2 - |a|2) = 2|b|p + 2|a|p - 2Re(|b|p-2¯ba) - 2Re(|a|p-2a¯b) = 2Re (|b|p-2¯b - |a|p-2a¯)(b - a) .

For every p  2 we have

|b - a|p-2  (|a| + |b|)p-2  2p-2 max{|a|p-2, |b|p-2}  2p-2(|a|p-2 + |b|p-2).

This combined with (9.1) gives (4.1). Proof of (4.2). Let 1 < p  2. The Newton-Lebnitz formula yields

|b|p-2¯b - |a|p-2a¯ =

|a + t(b - a)| = |(1 - t)a + tb|  |a| + |b|, 0  t  1.

(t) = p|a + t(b - a)|p-4 (Im{a¯b})2 +p(p - 1)|a + t(b - a)|p-4 Re{a¯(b - a)} + t|b - a|2 2 .

Thus we have

(t)  p min{1, p - 1}|a + t(b - a)|p-4 · (Im{a¯b})2 + Re{a¯(b - a)} + t|b - a|2 2

(9.6)

= p min{1, p - 1}|b - a|2|a + t(b - a)|p-2.

Since |a + t(b - a)|  |a| + |b|, we see that (4.4) follows from (9.8). Proof of (4.3). Suppose p > 2. Note that
