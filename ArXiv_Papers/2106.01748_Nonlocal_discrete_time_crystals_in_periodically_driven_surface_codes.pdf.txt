Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are nonequilibrium phases of matter characterized by robust subharmonic order parameter dynamics. We report a new type of DTC in a periodically driven surface code, the subharmonic signature of which is only observable with respect to some nonlocal order parameter. By modifying the commonly used metrics for characterizing ordinary DTCs, i.e., the spectral functions, spin-glass order parameters, and two-point correlators, we numerically investigate the different phases of the proposed system. Specifically, depending on the system parameters and boundary conditions, we find that the system may fall into either a "surface code" phase, trivial paramagnet phase, nonlocal period-doubling DTC phase, or nonlocal period-quadrupling DTC phase.

I. INTRODUCTION
Since the seminal work of Refs. [1, 2], the notion of the time crystals has intrigued many researchers and opened a new area in quantum many-body phases. The time crystals, if exist, demonstrate an instance of phases of matter with spontaneously broken time-translational symmetry and manifest themselves as a time-dependent ground state of an otherwise static and local Hamiltonian. While such continuous time crystals [1, 2] turn out to be impossible to exist [3­5], their nonequilibrium counterpart, termed discrete time crystals (DTCs), have been successfully achieved in experiments [6­12] following the theoretical proposals of Refs. [13­15]. Such DTCs are defined on periodically driven many-body systems and feature a (local) order parameter, the dynamics of which is locked at a fraction of the driving frequency. In the last few years, various aspects of DTCs have been extensively studied [16­43], including their potential application in quantum computing [44], quantum simulation [45, 46], and the observation of condensed matter phenomena in the time domain [47­51].
In a recent work by the same author [52], the physics of DTCs is known to be closely related to a type of quantum error correction (QEC) code [53­56]. Specifically, the observed robust period-doubling magnetization dynamics in periodically driven spin-1/2 DTCs originates from the exponential suppression of physical error with the system size due to the spin-spin interaction, which forms the stabilizer generators (mutually commuting operators) of the so-called quantum repetition code [57­59]. As the name suggests, the two logical basis states of the quantum repetition code are simply the tensor product of |0 and |1 states respectively, both of which represent the simultaneous eigenstates of all stabilizer generators with +1 eigenvalue. The presence of bit-flip errors changes the eigenvalue of some stabilizer generators from +1 to -1, which can in turn be detected and corrected. In the context of DTCs, these stabilizer generators appear at the hardware level as terms in the system's Hamiltonian. As such, DTCs are capable of performing passive error correction by energetically penalizing bit-flip error

events.
One main weakness of the quantum repetition code is its inability to correct phase-flip errors. While Ref. [52] has shown that phase-flip errors do not break DTCs, the sensitivity of the quantum repetition code to phase-flip errors implies the presence of local order parameter exhibiting subharmonic dynamics. Indeed, a natural candidate for such order parameter is the logical Z operator capable of distinguishing the two logical states. In the repetition-code-based DTCs, this logical Z operator is simply the average magnetization, which is also commonly used to probe period-doubling structure in previous literature.
In this paper, we propose a new type of DTC based on the so-called surface code [60­64], i.e., a more sophisticated topological QEC code defined on a two-dimensional square lattice. Unlike quantum repetition code, surface code is capable of correcting both bit-flip and phase-flip errors due to its nonlocal logical X and Z operators as strings of physical X and Z operators respectively, the weight of which grows with the system size. As an immediate consequence, the proposed DTC possesses a nonlocal order parameter displaying subharmonic dynamics and is hence termed nonlocal DTC onwards. To elucidate an explicit physical system supporting this exotic DTC, we consider a periodically driven surface code Hamiltonian and characterize its phases using a nonlocal generalization of some metrics previously used in studies of repetition-code-based DTCs [17]. Under open boundary conditions, we find that such a system may support either a "surface code" spin-glass phase, which is topologically equivalent to a static surface code Hamiltonian, a nonlocal period-doubling DTC phase, or a trivial paramagnet phase. Interestingly, under periodic boundary conditions, the system may additionally support a nonlocal period-quadrupling DTC phase.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce our system and elucidate the mechanism governing its nonlocal DTC phase. In Sec. III, we introduce a generalization of the three metrics previously used in studies of ordinary DTCs, i.e., the spectral functions, spin-glass order parameters, and two-point correlators, then utilize

2
them to characterize the phases of the proposed system. In Sec. IV, we discuss the effect of periodic boundary conditions on the system's phases, as well as some proposals for experimentally realizing the proposed system. We conclude this paper and present avenues for future studies in Sec. V.

II. PERIODICALLY DRIVEN SURFACE CODE AND 2T -PERIODIC NONLOCAL DTCS

Consider a three-time-step Hamiltonian that gives rise to the one-period propagator (Floquet operator [65, 66]) of the form

where HS,surface comprises the sum of the stabilizer generators associated with a Lx × Ly surface code, i.e.,

and 0,- = 0,+ + /T . In particular, the state |0 transforms into |1 over one period and vice versa, leading to a 2T -periodicity capturable by the operator Z. While |0 and |1 are highly entangled states, it can further be (2) shown that 2T -periodicity persists with respect to product states that can be written as superposition of logical states belonging to different stabilizer subspaces.

if either Lx or Ly is odd. The various terms appearing in Eq. (2) are schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 with dif-

In this

where | is a Floquet eigenstate of UT,ideal. By expand-

ing the exponentials of U~T as superpositions of products

of X1,j and Zi,1, it follows that nonzero contributions to

 phase between |0,± , as well as

which only appear at order sinLy (x) or sinLx (z) respec-

tively. Indeed, lower weight Pauli operators bring |1

outside the logical subspace, resulting in a state of zero

overlap with |0,± . Consequently, an imperfection of or-
der sin(x), sin(Z )  will only result in the relative phase deviation from  by an order of min(Lx,Ly).

Despite the similarity of the above feature with known

DTC models based on quantum repetition code [14], two

main differences exist. First, a nonlocal order parameter,

e.g., Z, is necessary for capturing the 2T periodicity in

the present system. Second, note that the usual DTC

models typically only supports a single subharmonic or-

der parameter dynamics, e.g., magnetization pointing in

a specific direction. By contrast, at least two nonlocal ob-

servables with subharmonic dynamics exist in the present

system, i.e., Z and X. To support this point, Fig. 2 dis-

plays the stroboscopic dynamics of Z and X for a surface

code of two different sizes. There, robust 2T periodic pro-

file is clearly evident in all cases despite the presence of

considerable imperfection in the parameters hx,j and hz,j responsible for enacting the logical X and Z gate.

code of size (a,c) 2 × 3, (b,d) 2 × 4. The system parameters

are taken to be the same as those of Fig. 2 and each data

point is averaged over 100 disorder realizations

Figure 3 further reveals that increasing Ly while fix-

ing Lx clearly improves the 2T oscillation profile of Z , but leaves that of X to be qualitatively the same. This

can be intuitively understood by inspecting the relative

phase

(recall Eqs. (6)-(8)), where |+ = (|0 + |1 )/ 2. In

particular, the initial state |1 (|+ ) leads to period-

doubling in Z ( X ) if Z   (X  ). By expanding U~T as a superposition of products of Xi,j and
Zi,j, it follows that the lowest order correction to X (Z ) from its ideal value of  occurs at the Lx-(Ly-)th order,

which corresponds to terms  Z ( X). This argument

can be straightforwardly extended to any other eigen-

state |0 of HS,surface. In this case, one may find two

quasienergy eigenstates |n,± of UT,ideal with /T spac-

ing that satisfy |0  |n,+ + |n,- . It then follows

that

i log

n,-|U~T |0 n,+|U~T |0

  up to a correction of order at

least Lx or Ly. Finally, by noting that any generic initial

state can be expanded in terms of UT,ideal eigenstates,

one concludes that the deviation from a perfect period-

doubling in X ( Z ) is suppressed through an increase

in Lx (Ly), which agrees with the observation in Fig. 3.

III. PHASE CHARACTERIZATION

A. Spectral functions

We define a spectral function [17, 67, 68] associated with quasienergy and excitation operator  as



s, = N,

S, (n, )d ,

(9)

nX -

where  0, X is a set of some random integers smaller than the the system's Hilbert space dimension,  1,

nX

S,

n , d


S, (n, ) =

| n||m |2

k=- m

×(n - m -  - - 2k/T ) . (10)

Intuitively, s, measures the tendency of an operator  to be a quasienergy excitation [68]. Indeed, if s, = 1,  essentially maps any quasienergy eigenstate | to
| + .

In the system under consideration, the logical operators Z and X exactly represent zero or /T quasienergy excitations at two special parameter values. Specifically, in the ideal case, it can be easily verified that Z and X map any Floquet eigenstate |n, ± to another |n,  that differs in quasienergy by /T , i.e., Z and X are /T quasienergy excitations. On the other hand, at hx,i,j = hz,i,j = 0, Eq. (1) reduces to the time evolution of the surface code Hamiltonian and supports two-fold degenerate eigenstates. As logical operators, Z and X act within these degenerate eigenstate subspaces, mapping one Floquet eigenstate to another with the same quasienergy, i.e., Z and X thus represent zero quasienergy excitations. In general, it follows that that the presence of /T quasienergy excitations yield /T separated quasienergy structure, and the system is consequently in a DTC phase. On the other hand, the presence of zero quasienergy excitations yield two-fold degenerate quasienergy structure, which is topologically equivalent to the surface code limit above. In this case, the system is termed to be in the "surface code" phase. In the absence of zero and /T quasienergy excitations, the system is in the trivial phase.

To characterize the system's phase at general parame-

ter values based on the presence or absence of zero and

/T quasienergy excitations above, it is instructive to

evaluate the four spectral functions sZ,0, sX,0, sZ,, and

sX,. Our results are summarized in Fig. 4(a). There, the

(nonlocal) DTC phase is associated with sZ, = sX,  1

which, as expected, exists near the ideal values, i.e.,

h¯



 2

.

It is also worth pointing out the presence of

"surface code" phase, characterized by sZ,0 = sX,0  1

in the vicinity of the surface code limit hx,i,j = hz,i,j = 0.

Away from these special values, the system is in the triv-

ial phase with sZ,0 = sX,0 = sZ, = sX,  0.

B. Generalized spin-glass order parameters and nonlocal correlators
Another useful diagnostic for characterizing the distinct phases in the system under consideration is to compute a set of generalized spin-glass (SG) order parameters

defined as

(HSSG) = N1

the

Hilbert space dimension, and |n is the n-th quasienergy

eigenstate. It is worth pointing out that the order pa-

rameter (SSG) has been previously employed in Ref. [17] to distinguish between the SG and paramagnet (PM)

order in the one-dimensional periodically driven Ising

chain. Interestingly, we found that (SSG)  0 for any S = X, Y, Z and parameter values in the periodically

driven surface code Hamiltonian considered in this pa-

per. This may naively suggest the absence of SG order in

such a system, which clearly contradicts the robust bulk

subharmonic dynamics observed in the previous section.

On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 4(b), we found that

(HSZG) and (VSXG) are nonzero in the vicinity of h¯ = 0 and h¯ = /2, which correspond to the previously identi-

fied "surface code" and nonlocal DTC phase respectively.

This suggests the presence of a new type of nonlocal SG

order.

The nonlocal SG order in the "surface code" and nonlocal DTC phase can be distinguished by further evaluating the correlators

C = HZ,iHZ,j ,t C = H~Z,iH~Z,j ,t C = VX,iVX,j ,t C = V~X,iV~X,j ,t C = Si,j ,Si ,j ,t

|n(t) is a Floquet eigenstate at t  (0, T ], S =

X, Y, Z, and |i - j| 1. In particular, as evidenced

in Fig. 3,the DTC (surface code) phase is characterized

by the presence (absence) of two crossing points between

the nonlocal correlators CHZ,1HZ,Ly ,t and CH~Z,1H~Z,Ly ,t or
CVX,1VX,Lx ,t and CV~X,1V~X,Lx ,t within (0, T ], whereas these nonlocal correlators are negligibly small in the PM phase.

These crossing points signal the rotation of the SG order

by  with respect to either/both X or/and Z, which in

All data points are averaged over 10 disorder realizations.

5 disorder realizations.

Unlike the open boundaries surface code considered in

the previous section, the toric code supports two logi-

At the parameter

values hz,i,1 = hx,1,j = /2 and hz,i,j=1 = hx,i=1,j = 0,

each of the system's Floquet quasienergies is twofold de-

are taken to be the same as those in Fig. 2 are used. The

system size is taken to be (a,b,c) 2 × 2 and (d) 2 × 4

The presence of two logical qubits in the periodically driven toric code may further be exploited to find a parameter regime in which the system supports a 4T periodic DTCs [52]. Specifically, at hz,i,j = /4, the second exponential in Eq. (1) realizes a CNOT gate (up to an unimportant phase factor) with the first and second qubit being the control and target qubit respectively, i.e., it maps X1  X1X2, Z1  Z1, X2  X2, and Z2  Z1Z2. By further setting hx,1,j = /2 and hx,i=1,j = 0, the system's Floquet operator reduces exactly to

UT,ideal = X 1CN OT 1,2e-iHS,toric ,

(15)

which maps |00  |10  |01  |11  |00 . One may then construct a quadruplet of /4 quasienergy separated eigenstates as

|00 + |10 + 2|01 + 3|11

|0, =

2

, (16)

where  = 1, i, -i, -1. It follows that the system's

other quasienergy eigenstates, which consist of states

belonging to different stabilizer subspaces also similarly

form a quadruplet of /4 quasienergy separation. The

/4 spacing in the system's quasienergy levels is in

turn responsible for generating 4T -periodic dynamics.

Such 4T -periodicity manifests itself, e.g., in the strobo-

scopic dynamics of Z2 with respect to the initial state

driven toric Hamiltonian of size (a) 2 × 2, (b) 4 × 2, (c) 2 ×

4, and (d) under the periodically driven surface code (with

open boundaries) of size 2 × 4. We take JX,i,j = JZ,i,j = 0.5, hX,i,j = 0.0125 J¯X,i,j = J¯Y,i,j = 0.5, and h¯X,1,j = h¯X,i=1,j - /2 = 2h¯Z,i,j = 0.475.

error of order Ly on some properly defined Z2 (See Appendix A for detail). Intuitively, a logical error capable of destroying the system's period-quadrupling dynamics is either  X2 or  X1, which comprises a weight-Ly string of Z or X operators respectively. This argument is confirmed in Fig. 7(c), which shows that an increase in Ly significantly enhances and prolongs the observed 4T oscillation. By contrast, as demonstrated in Fig. 7(b), increasing Lx does not seem to yield qualitative effect since the weight of X1 remains constant. Finally, as highlighted in Fig. 7(d), in the open boundaries setting, the 4T oscillation profile quickly disappears even at a considerable system size, thus suggesting the absence of 4T DTC phase.

B. Potential experimental realizations

Ordinary DTCs have been realized in several exper-

imental platforms, which include trapped ions [6, 12],

Nitrogen-Vacancy centers [7], and nuclear magnetic mo-

ments [8­10]. Recently, the Sycamore qubit processor

[70] is identified to be another promising platform for

simulating DTCs [46]. We expect that the periodically

driven surface codes proposed in this paper can be ap-

proximated in trapped ions setup [6, 12], or fully simu-

lated with Sycamore device [70].

In both trapped ions and Sycamore experiments, the

weight-four interaction SX,i,j and SX,i,j of Eq. (2) can be obtained by conjugating an appropriate weight-two

qubit interaction with a combination of single- and two-

qubit rotations. Specifically, the source of interaction in

trapped ions experiments comes from the spin-dependent

optical dipole forces that enact long-range Coulomb-like

interaction of the form Gi =

Zi Zj j |i-j|

[6, 12],

where

0 <  < . Other types of weight-two interactions can

then be obtained via appropriate single qubit rotations,

and similarly for SZ,i,j. However, it is important to note

that the above procedure does not exactly reproduce the

actual nearest-neighbor SZ,i,j and SX,i,j due to the long-

range nature of the Coulomb-like interaction. Never-

theless, for a sufficiently large  (  1.5 in Ref. [6]),

the next-nearest-neighbor and longer interactions can be

treated as perturbation and exploited in experiments to

investigate the robustness of the nonlocal DTC phase

expected in such a system. The above procedure may

also yield unwanted nearest-neighbor weight-three inter-

actions such as Zi-1,jXi,jXi,j±1, which can in principle

be systematically eliminated using dynamical decoupling.

The Sycamore device [70] may prove to be a more

suitable platform for exactly implementing the proposed

model. To this end, the stabilizers SX,i,j and SZ,i,j terms

can be implemented solely from a combination of sin-

V. CONCLUSION

trivial paramagnets. These metrics further allow the characterization of the system's other phases, which include the trivial paramagnetic and "surface code" phase. The latter is topologically equivalent to the static surface code system in the absence of magnetic field.
The nonlocal DTCs observed in this paper are also expected to exist in a variety of other topologically ordered systems. To this end, a comprehensive study of other periodically driven topological quantum error correction codes, e.g., the color codes [71, 72], the Majorana version of the surface codes [73], or the quantum double models [69], thus represents a promising direction for future work. In this case, the three nonlocal metrics introduced above will further open an opportunity for discovering other exotic phases in these systems. To improve their experimental feasibility beyond trapped ions and Sycamore platforms, it will also be interesting to explore the possibility of observing nonlocal DTCs with continuous driving. Finally, given that nonlocal DTCs share a similar physics as that of quantum error correction codes, their potential application in quantum computing poses another interesting open question worth exploring.
Note added: During the finalization of this work, we came across a recent similar preprint [74] proposing a new type of discrete time crystal in periodically driven topological ordered systems, with a particular example on the periodically driven surface codes. Despite the similarity in the model under study, Ref. [74] focuses on rigorously establishing the theory of topologically-ordered time crystals (equivalent to nonlocal DTCs introduced here), whereas this work focuses on characterizing the various phases of the system under both periodic and open boundary conditions.

We have introduced a periodically driven surface code and highlighted its nonlocal DTC phase. Unlike other previously studied DTCs, a nonlocal order parameter is neccesary for capturing its subharmonic signature. The nonlocal generalization of the spectral functions, spinglass order parameters, and two-point correlators are further introduced to distinguish such nonlocal DTCs from
