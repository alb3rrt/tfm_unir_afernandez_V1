Abstract The correct modeling of e+e- collision events at the International Linear Collider (ILC), as well as the response of a collider detector like the Silicon Detector (SiD), is crucial to evaluating the expected sensitivity to key properties of the Higgs boson. In this document we describe the event generation and detector simulation in use for the SiD Letters of Interest submitted for the 2021 Snowmass community planning exercise.
1 Introduction
The 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson [1, 2] at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was a pivotal event in high energy particle physics. The community is moving toward a consensus that a Higgs factory, designed to enable the precision measurement of the Higgs properties, may be the best next step after the LHC. The International Linear Collider (ILC) [3, 4, 5, 6] is one such Higgs factory.
The Silicon Detector (SiD) is one of two detector concepts put forward in the ILC Technical Design Report (TDR) - the other is the International Large Detector (ILD) [6]. SiD employs all Silicon tracking and electromagnetic calorimetry placed within a 5T solenoid to enable the particle flow technique [7]. While some of the sensitive detector technologies assumed for the TDR are being reconsidered in light of recent advances, nonetheless SiD provides a useful baseline design for evaluating the sensitivity to Higgs boson properties at the ILC Higgs factory.
The Snowmass community planning exercise [8], sponsored by the Division of Particles and Fields of the American Physical Society, aims to bring together physicists based in the US together with international partners in order to consider and evaluate potential next steps for their field. International partners have developed software tools for simulating Standard Model (SM) processes expected at the ILC assuming a generic ILC detector [9]. SiD is participating in this exercise.
In parallel, SiD is pursuing simulation tools specific to the SiD detector. In this document we describe the SiD simulation framework used for the processes targeted by the Snowmass Letters

2 Common SiD Simulation Tools
Two event generators are in use by SiD for generation of e+e- collision events: Whizard [15] and MG5 aMC@NLO [16]. In addition to capturing the physics of the e+e- interaction, Whizard also captures the crucial physics of initial state radiation (ISR) and beamstrahlung. Both effects involve radiation of photons from the initial state, lowering the effective center of mass energy and therefore impacting the cross section and event kinematics. At the time of writing MG5 aMC@NLO has not yet implemented either ISR or beamstrahlung.
However, both generators capture a critical feature of beams at the ILC: polarization. Polarization of the initial state electrons and positrons is central to the design of the ILC because it allows an additional constraint on the initial state and therefore also the final state. Moreover, initial states with righthanded electrons yield much smaller cross sections for some backgrounds. For all simulation, we assume the nominal TDR assumption of 80% polarized electrons and 30% polarized positrons.
For final state showering and hadronization of events either Pythia6 [17] or Pythia8 [18] are used. While Pythia6 is useful because it allows direct use of tunes obtained from the experiments at LEPII, Pythia8 is a far more flexible and modern tool despite the inapplicability of LEPII tunes.
Fast detector simulation is useful for preliminary investigations of signal sensitivity because it is fast. It enables rapid identification of potential backgrounds and their order of magnitude after signal selection. To this end, we use the Delphes [19] fast simulation of the SiD detector using the parametrized detector description in the DSiD card [20]. DSiD directly implements the parametrized expected performance of SiD documented in the ILC TDR [3].
Nevertheless, fast simulation has drawbacks which, in some cases, are severe. In these cases full detector simulation, for which all relevant physical processes are simulated in tracking individual particles through SiD, is critical. Even in cases where fast simulation reasonably capture full simulation performance, the latter should be used in any evaluation of sensitivity. For full SiD simulation we use the ILCSoft framework [], in which Geant4 [21] is employed using the DD4Hep [22] interface.
3 Common Background Simulation
The challenge of generating a full set of ILC SM process simulation is described in [23]. The set generated for the Detailed Baseline Design (DBD) common to SiD and ILD was used for studies documented in the ILC TDR [6]. This set of Whizard 1.40 files in StdHep [24] format has been preserved and is in use for Snowmass 2021. These include files for four center of mass energies ( s = 250, 350, 500, 1000 GeV) and include all processes above threshold with final state fermion multiplicities from one to eight, assuming 100% polarized beams e-L e+R and e-Re+L . This includes processes initiated from an e initial state, which yields odd final state fermion multiplicities.
3.1 Barklow DBD all SM background
Because thousands of distinct processes were generated for the DBD, each in separate files, and with pure polarized beams, they must be mixed together in the correct way to simulate the SM and the assumed beam polarization fractions. During the DBD study this was done

once for SiD at the StdHep level by Tim Barklow in order to streamline analysis for end users. Each process was weighted by SM cross section and polarization weights necessary to reproduce 80% polarized electron and 30% polarized positron beams. These mixed samples are named all SM background.
Thus detector simulation, whether fast or full, and with any software and detector version, can simply run on these StdHep files to simulate the full SM at the ILC assuming the nominal 80/30 polarization scheme. Each file contains all processes, though in order to alleviate storage issues and to speed simulation and analysis events are weighted with weights larger than one. In some cases, SM processes which are interesting signals (e.g. Higgs or top pair production) have been separated out from the mixed samples, in which case the mixed samples are referred to as all other SM background.
See Table 1 for some details on the Barklow mixed DBD background files. All of the files in this table have been passed through the Delphes 3.4.2 fast simulation with the DSiD card and full simulation of SiD option 2 version 3, in ILCSoft v02-00-02.

3.2 SiD MC20 and MC21 Campaigns

While the mixed DBD background files are useful for identifying background processes in cases

of large background yields, they are statistically limited and in some cases the process event

weight is prohibitively large. For such cases new background samples have been produced in the

SiD MC20 and MC21 production campaigns using Whizard 2.6.4 with the polarization fractions

set to the nominal TDR design assumption. The equivalent luminosity is dtL = 2 ab-1. In

these samples ISR is simulated but beamstrahlung is not.

The effect of beamstrahlung is important and must be considered in any sensitivity estimate.

Beamstrahlung has been neglected in these samples because the effect depends critically on the

beam parameters, which will not be known at least until the ILC design has been finalized.

However, Whizard can include the effect if the beam parameters are known. For examples of

the impact of beamstrahlung on background processes see Table 6 in [25]. Systematic studies

to evaluate the impact of beamstrahlung will be performed for the Snowmass studies discussed

here.

4 Signal Simulation and Analysis

Higgs bosons are produced in e+e- collisions in several ways. Higgstrahlung e+e-  ZH

is an s-channel processes e+e-

process which peaks near s  ¯H, e+e-H supplement

= 250 GeV. The Higgstrahlung at

also be produced in association s = 500 GeV. In double Higgs

 tt¯H above ZHH, ¯HH

a threshold near two Higgs bosons

are produced in association either with a Z boson or a neutrino pair. See Figure 1 for signal cross sections vs. s.

For all SiD Snowmass LoIs except the Higgs self-coupling LoI, the Higgstrahlung process is chosen at s = 250 GeV. The yields at this s ensure high precision measurements, though these analyses could be performed at any s above thresholds for Higgs production. In all cases

the event generation files have been passed through the Delphes fast simulation v3.4.2 with the

DSiD card and full simulation of SiD option 2 version 3, in ILCSoft v02-00-02.

4.1 Higgs to Invisible

In the SM the Higgs boson decays invisibly when it decays through H  ZZ  ¯¯ since

neutrinos interact only weakly and cannot be detected in a collider detector. In theories of

Beyond the SM (BSM) physics, the Higgs may decay to other particles which are not detected

in a collider detector, e.g. dark matter.

The event generation for decays with SiD is performed

the analysis to evaluate the expected precision for with Whizard 2.6.4. Higgstrahlung e+e-  ZH at

invisible Higgs s = 250 GeV

is assumed with the nominal beam polarization, and the Higgs is required to decay in the SM

4

channel to four neutrinos. Thus this sample may be used to study sensitivity for any model in which the Higgs decays to BSM particles which are not detected by a collider detector. For a description of the analyses of under consideration for Snowmass, see [26].

4.2 Higgs to Long-lived Dark Photons
In the SM the Higgs boson may decay to long-lived particles through quark pairs H  qq¯ when the quarks hadronize into mesons or baryons which do not decay promptly, e.g. B, D and K mesons. In a BSM model like the dark photon model [27], the Higgs can decay through H  ZDZD, ZZD, HDHD, where ZD are dark photons which then decay to fermion pairs and HD is the dark singlet Higgs.
In the dark photon model there are four free parameters: the ZD mass and /ZD mixing parameter and the HD mass and H/HD mixing parameter . The lifetime of the ZD depends on mZD and and for suitable ranges of these parameters can produce non-prompt ZD decays. The event generation for the analysis to evaluate the expected sensitivity to such decays is performed with MG5 aMC@NLO using the HAHM model [28] written by the authors of [27].
It should be emphasized that while the dark photon model is a very specific model, the phenomenology of any long-lived particle decaying to fermion pairs (e.g. axions) in a collider detector is captured by the events produced with that model.

4.3 Higgs CP in Higgs to Tau Pairs
This Snowmass LoI includes authors from both ILD and SiD. For the SiD authors samples have been generated assuming the SM. The event generation is performed with MG5 aMC@NLO with Pythia8 for hadronization and tau decay. BSM values for the CP angles can be set in MG5 aMC@NLO using alternate models such as the Minimal Supersymmetric SM (MSSM) or Next to MSSM (NMSSM), which adds a Higgs singlet to the five Higgs bosons of the MSSM. Production is ongoing.
The proper treatment of tau decays is critical to the correct simulation of H   + - events. Spin correlations must be preserved from the tau to daughter particles and throughout the decay chain. The treatment of tau decay in Pythia8 has been validated against other tools like Tauola, so Pythia8 is invoked for tau decay as well as hadronization.

4.4 Higgs Self-coupling

Since Higgs

the Higgs self-coupling cannot productions modes e+e-  Z

production  ¯HH

modes, the double at s = 1000 GeV

are assumed in the event generation.

The self-coupling is assumed to be the SM coupling, but any BSM coupling will affect double

Higgs events primarily throught the impact on the cross section. Therefore the SM samples can

be used for BSM studies if the BSM model does not modify the coupling in such a way as to

modify event kinematics. The Higgs decays are fully inclusive assuming SM branching ratios.

Whizard 2.6.4 is used for the LoI study.
