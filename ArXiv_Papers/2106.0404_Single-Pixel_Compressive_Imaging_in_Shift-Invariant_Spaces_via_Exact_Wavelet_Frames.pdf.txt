Abstract
This paper introduces a novel framework for single-pixel imaging via compressive sensing (CS) in shift-invariant (SI) spaces by exploiting the sparsity property of a wavelet representation. We reinterpret the acquisition procedure of a single-pixel camera as filtering of the observed signal with continuousdomain functions that lie in an SI subspace spanned by the integer shifts of the box function. The signal is modeled by an arbitrary SI generator whose special case is the box function, which, as we show in the paper, is conventionally used in single-pixel imaging. We propose to use separable B-spline generators which are intuitively complemented by sparsity-inducing spline wavelets. The SI models of the acquisition and the underlying signal lead to an exact discretization of an inherently continuous-domain inverse problem to a finite-dimensional problem of CS type. By solving the CS optimization problem, a parametric representation of the signal is obtained. Such a representation offers many practical advantages in image processing applications. We propose an efficient matrix-free implementation of the framework and conduct it on the standard test images and real-world measurement data. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a significant improvement of the reconstruction quality relative to the conventional CS setting.

I. INTRODUCTION

Sampling theories are concerned with the reconstruction of analog signals from discrete-time samples.

Being an ill-posed inverse problem, reconstruction from samples must rely on some signal prior, e.g., an

assumption that the observed signal lies in a predefined subspace. In conventional sampling, famously

embodied in the Nyquist-Shannon theorem [1], [2], signals are assumed to lie in a shift-invariant (SI)

subspace spanned by the integer shifts of the sinc function, where sinc(t) = sin(t)/(t). The Nyquist-

Shannon theorem was generalized to a wider class of SI subspaces [3]­[5], which allows more realistic

sampling schemes and signal representations, including splines [6] and wavelets [7], [8]. To obtain an

exact reconstruction, the signal has to be sampled at least at the rate of innovation [9], which corresponds

to the Nyquist limit in the conventional sampling theorem.

During the past two decades, sparsity has become an important signal prior in the field of signal

processing. It lies at the heart of compressive sensing (CS) [10]­[12], a sampling and reconstruction

method that goes beyond the Nyquist limit. In standard CS, an unknown signal f : D  R, where D

is an uncountable subset of R in a region of interest, is assumed to be exactly represented as the linear

where  : RN  RM is a discrete version of the forward model, with elements []m,n = zm, n .

While the 2-norm is used to measure the consistency of the solution with the measurements, the 1-

norm regularization promotes sparse solutions.

In the vast majority of papers, the discrete version of a continuous-domain forward model is an approx-

imation that introduces errors to real-world implementations of CS acquisition systems. Furthermore, one

typically assumes the bandlimited model of the underlying signal, which may additionally contribute to the

reconstruction error if its continuous-domain generator is not considered in the discretization procedure.

There have been several attempts to generalize CS to infinite-dimensional problems, that were reported

in [13]­[15]. The SI signal model is employed in a few works to exactly discretize continuous-domain

inverse problems into CS-type problems. In [16] and [17], Eldar and Mishali use CS for reconstruction of

signals in unions of SI subspaces. Sparsity is modeled by assuming that only a few out of all generators in the union are active. The authors of [18]­[20] use splines as a representation basis of the underlying signal for the discretization of the continuous-domain inverse problems. The signal is assumed to be sparse in the representation basis, i.e. it has only a few innovations per time unit. A different approach is considered in [21] and [22], where an SI model of the underlying one-dimensional signal is used to exactly discretize an inherently continuous-domain inverse problem, and the expansion coefficients of the SI model are assumed to be sparse in a certain discrete transform domain.
In this paper, we propose to use SI models for the discretization of the underlying signal and the acquisition procedure in single-pixel imaging. The concept of a single-pixel camera followed the birth of the CS theory and was first reported by Duarte et al. in [23]. Over the past decade, single-pixel imaging has been used in many applications and has several areas of possible advantage [24]. A singlepixel camera consists of two components - the light modulator and the single-pixel detector. The light modulator is usually implemented by the digital micromirror device (DMD), which selectively redirects the light beams to the photodetector or projects the sequence of light patterns onto the object that is being captured by the detector. We model the DMD modulation procedure with two-dimensional filtering by separable functions that lie in an SI subspace spanned by the box function, which is also referred to as the B-spline of order 0. The underlying signal is assumed to lie in an arbitrary SI subspace. We link the theories of generalized sampling in SI spaces and CS to discretize the inherently continuousdomain inverse problem of single-pixel imaging exactly. We propose to use polynomial B-splines as a representation basis of the signal. The polynomial B-splines are compactly supported and provide many practical advantages in image processing once their expansion coefficients are recovered directly from a reduced set of measurements. We employ spline wavelets as sparsity-inducing bases, which offer an intuitive complement of the B-spline function spaces. We show that when the B-spline representation function corresponds to the wavelet scaling function, the recovered wavelet coefficients exactly match the orthogonal projection of the underlying signal onto the continuous-domain analysis wavelet functions. We offer an efficient matrix-free implementation of the proposed framework which significantly reduces the computational costs of the reconstruction algorithm and suits the application to large-scale images. The reconstruction quality of the framework was assessed on the standard test images and data acquired by an off-the-shelf realization of the single-pixel camera. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the reconstruction quality relative to the conventional single-pixel imaging framework.
The paper is organized as follows: we give a short reminder on multiresolution representation in Section II, with the emphasis placed on the orthogonal projection of signals onto the Riesz bases. In Section III, we link multiresolution representation with the generalized sampling in SI spaces and extend the

results to higher dimensions in Section IV. In Section V, we propose a novel framework for single-pixel imaging via CS in SI spaces based on a wavelet-domain sparsity assumption. In Section VI, an efficient implementation of the proposed framework for large-scale images is suggested. Experimental results are illustrated in Section VII. We relate our work to the findings of other studies in Section VIII and conclude the paper in Section IX.

II. MULTIRESOLUTION REPRESENTATION

We deal with the problem of recovering and representing an unknown function f (t) that lies in the

Hilbert space L2, which consists of functions that are square-integrable and whose inner product is defined

by


f (t), g(t) = f (t)g(t)dt,

(2)

-
for some g(t)  L2. In order to recover f (t) from its uniform samples, it is commonly assumed that f (t)

lies in an appropriate SI subspace V(0) of L2 [1]­[5]. Any signal f (t)  V(0) has the form

f (t) = a(0)[k](t - kT ),

(3)

kZ

for some generator (t) and sampling period T . For simplicity, throughout the manuscript, we assume

T = 1.

To guarantee a unique and stable representation of any signal in V(0) by expansion coefficients a(0)[k], the generator should form a Riesz basis for L2 [4], [5]. A countable set of vectors {(t - k)} in L2 is

a Riesz basis for L2 if it is complete and if and only if there exist two positive constants  > 0 and

 <  such that

k |a(0)[k]|2 is the squared 2-norm of the expansion coefficients a(0)[k]. Namely,

a Riesz basis is a set of linearly independent vectors which ensures that a small modification of the

expansion coefficients results in a small distortion of the signal representation. In particular, the basis is

orthonormal if and only if  =  = 1. Notice that a set {(t - k)} in L2 is an exact frame for L2 if it is a Riesz basis for L2 [25].

Furthermore, we assume that V(0) is a subspace in a sequence of nested subspaces such that V(i)  V(i+1) for i  Z. These subspaces are spanned by a set of basis vectors {(2-it - k)}, obtained by dilation and

translation of a generator (t) [7], [8], which is also referred to as a scaling function. Approximation of f (t)  L2 at resolution 2i in V(i) is defined by

f^(i)(t) = a(i)[k](2-it - k).

(5)

kZ

A procedure for obtaining the minimum squared error approximation of a signal f (t) in V(i) is given

below.

The expansion coefficients in (5) of the orthogonal projection of a signal f (t)  L2 on V(i) can be determined by filtering and sampling, written in an inner product notation as

a(i)[k] = 2-i f (t), °(2-it - k) ,

(6)

where °(t) is a dual function of (t). Since {(2-it - k)} is a Riesz basis for L2, there is a collection {°(2-it - k)} such that {°(2-it - k)} is biorthogonal to {(2-it - k)}, i.e.,

(2-it - k), °(2-it - l) = 2i[k - l].

(7)

If {(2-it - k)} is a Riesz basis, then so is its biorthogonal basis [25]. When the set of vectors

{(2-it - k)} spans only a subspace V(i)  L2, there may be many choices of a biorthogonal basis in L2 satisfying (7).
The fact that the subspaces V(i) are nested implies that the basis vectors {(2-it - k)} at coarser

levels are included in the finer resolution subspaces. Hence, the expansion coefficients a(i+1)[k] can be obtained by discrete-time filtering of a(i)[k] and downsampling by a factor of two [7], [26]. Consequently, all the coefficients a(i)[k] for i > 0 can be computed from a(0)[k] by repeating this procedure. Such a

sequence of fine-to-coarse approximations defines a multiresolution analysis, called a pyramid transform.

In order to have a complete and reversible multiresolution representation, we have to extract and

save the loss of information between the approximation of f (t) at two successive resolutions 2i and

2i+1. This difference of information is called the detail signal at level 2i+1, and we can denote it by g(i+1) := f^(i) - f^(i+1). The detail signal g(i+1) is included in V(i), and is perpendicular to V(i+1), i.e.,

it is given by the orthogonal projection of the signal f (t) on the orthogonal complement of V(i+1) in

V(i) [7]. Let W(i+1) be the detail subspace at resolution 2i+1, then g(i+1)  W(i+1), W(i+1)  V(i+1)

and W(i+1)  V(i+1) = V(i). In essence, we want to construct sets of SI bases for the sequence of detail

subspaces {W(i), i  Z} so that

These subspaces are spanned by basis vectors {(2-it - k)}, obtained by dilation and translation of a generator (t) [7], which is also referred to as a mother wavelet.
The detail signal of a function f (t)  L2 at resolution 2i has the form

g(i)(t) = d(i)[k](2-it - k),

where d(i)[k] are wavelet coefficients. In order to compute the wavelet coefficients, we can apply the

same procedure for obtaining the approximation coefficients a(i)[k], i.e.,

d(i)[k] = 2-i f (t), °(2-it - k) ,

(11)

where °(t) is a dual function of (t). The biorthogonality condition holds across resolution levels 2i:

(2-it - k), °(2-it - l) = 2i[k - l].

(12)

The basis function °(t) is analysis wavelet associated with the synthesis wavelet (t). The wavelets

°(t) and (t) are different in the general biorthogonal case, unless the basis functions are orthogonal.

For any i  Z, a set of vectors {(2-(i+1)t - k)} spans W(i+1)  V(i). Thus, the wavelet coefficients

d(i+1)[k] can be computed by discrete-time filtering of a(i)[k] and keeping every other sample of the

output [7]. Finally, for a given signal f (t)  V(0) in (3), represented by its expansion coefficients a(0)[k]

at resolution 20, the wavelet decomposition is of the form

The wavelet forward and inverse transform can be accomplished efficiently by using the perfect

z-transform of the discrete-time filters in the filter bank associated with the analysis scaling and wavelet functions °(t) and °(t), respectively. Analogously, V (z) and W (z) are the z-transform of the discrete-

time filters associated with the synthesis (reconstruction) scaling and wavelet functions (t) and (t),

The signal is filtered with an arbitrary sampling kernel (t) before being sampled and filtered with a discrete-time correction filter H(z) to obtain the expansion coefficients a(0)[k]. Notice that the role of (t) is analogous to that of an antialiasing filter in Shannon's sampling framework.

respectively. The analysis part of the block diagram in Fig. 1 is applied iteratively for i = 0 to i = (I - 1), while keeping the wavelet coefficients for each level. The synthesis procedure is also implemented iteratively and begins with the coarsest level i = (I - 1) of the pyramid. The impulse responses of the filters W° (z), W (z), V°(z) and V (z) depend on the choice of the scaling and wavelet basis functions based on certain desirable properties of the multiresolution analysis. The construction of a perfect reconstruction filter bank for various orthogonal and biorthogonal basis functions has been proposed in numerous papers [8], [27], [28]. For image processing, and particularly for coding applications, it is desirable to use symmetric filters with linear phase and compact support. The families of biorthogonal [29] and semiorthogonal [30] spline wavelets [31] satisfy the desired properties, and are efficiently implemented using finite impulse response (FIR) filter banks. The scaling functions are the polynomial B-splines [6], whose integer shifts span Riesz bases.

III. GENERALIZED SAMPLING IN SHIFT-INVARIANT SPACES

Before applying the exact wavelet decomposition by using the discrete-time analysis filters, a given signal should initially be represented by appropriate approximation coefficients at resolution 20. We

assume that a continuous-time signal f (t) lies in an SI subspace V(0) of L2 and is given by (3). The generator (t) forms a Riesz basis for L2 and satisfies (4). In order to obtain a discrete-time representation,

the signal is filtered with an analog prefilter and sampled uniformly at time instants k. Samples c[k] in

the general SI sampling scheme (see Fig. 2) can be expressed as



c[k] = f (t)(t - k)dt f (t), (t - k) ,

(14)

-

where (-t) is the impulse response of the prefilter. Sampling in SI spaces [3]­[5] is practical and

retains the shift-invariant property of the Shannon's sampling theory. In an ideal scenario, the sampling

June 2, 2021

8

kernel (t) is orthogonal or biorthogonal to the signal generator (t), which implies that c[k] = a(0)[k].

However, in practical applications sampling is not ideal and is often imposed by a physical device. Thus,

a more realistic setting is to let (t) be an arbitrary sampling kernel.

Let us denote the sampled cross-correlation sequence between the sampling kernel (t) and the signal

generator (t) with

r[k] = (t), (t - k) .

(15)

The expression (14) of the samples c[k] can be expanded to

c[k] =

a(0)[l](t - l), (t - k)

lZ

= a(0)[l] (t - l), (t - k)

(16)

lZ

= a(0)[l]r[k - l] = a(0)  r[k],
lZ
where () is the convolution operator. Using the Fourier relations, it follow that

C(ej) = A(0)(ej)R(ej),

(17)

where C(ej), A(0)(ej) and R(ej) are the discrete-time Fourier transforms (DTFTs) of c[k], a(0)[k] and r[k], respectively. In order to obtain a(0)[k], the orthogonal projection of f (t) onto V(0) can be obtained from samples c[k] by filtering with a correction filter whose impulse response is given by the

DTFT [3]­[5]

H (ej  )

=

1 R(ej) .

(18)

A rather mild condition on the generator (t) and the sampling kernel (t) should be met in order to be

able to recover a(0)[k] from the samples [5]:

R(ej) > ,

(19)

for some constant  > 0. In general, the Riesz basis condition (4) guarantees that (18) is well defined [4], [5]. Note that for orthogonal and biorthogonal basis functions r[k] = [k] and H(ej) = 1. In this case, the samples do not have to be processed by the correction filter to determine the approximation coefficients a(0)[k]. Furthermore, when orthogonality or biorthogonality is not satisfied, an elegant SI sampling framework and an efficient implementation of the correction filter (18) is possible in B-spline function spaces [4], [32], [33]. In such function spaces, the correction filter can be determined analytically and the denominator in (18) corresponds to a concatenation of a causal and an anticausal infinite impulse response (IIR) filter with a simple expression [32]. This is due to the compact support of the polynomial

9

B-splines for which the cross-correlation sequence r[k] has only a few nonzero symmetric entries around k = 0.
Once the approximation coefficients are determined, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) described in Section II can be applied. The wavelet analysis is popular in many signal and image processing tasks, and particularly in coding applications [34] for data storage and transmission. The approximation coefficients a(0)[k] at resolution 20 can be perfectly recovered from the wavelet coefficients by repeating the process of upsampling by a factor of two and discrete-time filtering with synthesis filters. Note that a(0)[k] are not necessarily the pointwise values of the signal. To reconstruct the signal, a(0)[k] are modulated with a train of Diracs kZ (t-k) and filtered with an analog filter whose impulse response corresponds to the generator (t). The reconstruction procedure is illustrated in Fig. 2. In case when the signal f (t) lies in the subspace V(0) spanned by {(t - k)}, the reconstruction f^(0)(t) is perfect, i.e., f^(0)(t) = f (t). Contrarily, if f (t)  L2, but does not lie specifically in V(0), f^(0)(t) is the minimum squared error approximation of the signal f (t) in V(0). However, it is often more desirable to reconstruct the pointwise values of the signal in various resolutions than its analog representation, especially for two-dimensional signals. The pointwise values of f^(0)(t) is particularly efficient to obtain by using the B-spline representation [32], [33]. In this case, instead of modulation with a train of Diracs and analog filtering, the approximation coefficients a(0)[k] are filtered with an FIR filter that has only a few coefficients.

IV. EXTENSIONS TO HIGHER DIMENSIONS

The results in Section II and Section III can be extended to higher dimensions through the use of the tensor product, provided that the sampling is performed on the Cartesian grid [4], [7], [32]. All the formulas presented so far can be extended by considering the space variables (u, v)  R2, and by replacing single summations and integrals with multiple ones. In practice, we often use separable functions of the form (u, v) = (u)(v), which greatly simplify the implementation. Separability retains the onedimensional Riesz basis condition in multiple dimensions [4]. A signal f (u, v)  V(20) has the form

f (u, v) =

a(0)[k, l](u - k)(v - l),

(20)

kZ lZ

where a(0)[k, l] are two-dimensional expansion coefficients.

In a two-dimensional wavelet decomposition, there are four types of basis functions corresponding to

a single scaling function and three wavelets: (u, v) = (u)(v),

u(u, v) = (u)(v), (21)
v(u, v) = (u)(v),

uv(u, v) = (u)(v). Since the corresponding wavelet decomposition is separable, it can be obtained by successive onedimensional fast wavelet transform along the rows and columns [7], [30]. The two-dimensional wavelet decomposition is of the form

f (u, v) =

a(I)[k, l](2-I u - k, 2-I v - l)

To obtain the approximation coefficients at resolution 20, f (u, v) is filtered with an analog prefilter

and uniformly sampled. Two-dimensional samples c[k, l] can be expressed as


c[k, l] =

where (u, v) is a separable two-dimensional sampling kernel and () is a two-dimensional convolution operator. The convolution is separable, i.e., rk and rl denote row and column vectors composed of the cross-correlation sequence r[k]. A detailed explanation of the result in (23) is given in Appendix. It follows that all filtering operations are separable and applied successively along the coordinates.

V. SINGLE-PIXEL IMAGING VIA COMPRESSIVE SENSING IN SHIFT-INVARIANT SPACES Sampling and reconstruction in SI spaces resembles the Nyquist-Shannon theorem. The sampling rate in the SI sampling framework is determined by a number of degrees of freedom per time unit, which is also referred to as the rate of innovation [9]. Signals are sampled at least at the rate of innovation

DRAFT

11

 = 1/T = 1, for T = 1, in order to represent f (t) exactly. Note that the rate of innovation in the Nyquist-Shannon theorem corresponds to the Nyquist limit. Signals in SI spaces are often related to high rates of innovation, even though their information rates might be low. It is challenging to build sampling hardware that operates at a sufficient rate when the rate of innovation is high. For example, high-resolution imaging technologies in the non-visible wavelength spectrum can be impractical or very expensive to implement.

A. A Short Review of Compressive Sensing

Compressive sensing [10]­[12] is a sampling and reconstruction framework that, unlike the conventional

sampling theorems, focuses on the information rate of the signal rather than its innovation rate. A signal

with a low information rate can be exactly recovered from far fewer measurements (samples) in the CS

framework than in the conventional sampling frameworks, even if it has a high innovation rate. The theory

of CS has led to the enhancement of signal reconstructions in low-resolution imaging devices [35] and

in medical devices where the full measurements are missing or not available (e.g., magnetic resonance

imaging [36], computed tomography, etc.).

Compressive sensing rests on a prior that an observed signal f (t)  L2 is Q-sparse in a certain

reconstruction space S = {n(t)}Nn=1, i.e., it is represented with at most Q N nonzero coefficients

in a proper basis. The signal f (t) is represented by coefficients x  RN in the basis {n(t)}Nn=1, such

that f (t) =

where  is an M × N sensing matrix whose entries are given by []m,n = zm(t), n(t) . The theory of CS assumes that it is possible to reconstruct the signal from an underdetermined set of equations by restricting the expansion to no more than Q atoms in the basis {n(t)}Nn=1 [10], [11]. Thus, the signal can be recovered by solving an optimization problem

from M 2Q linear measurements is possible under strict conditions on , namely restricted isometry

property (RIP) and incoherence [10], [38]­[40].

Fig. 3. Single-Pixel Imaging. A scene is modulated by a measurement pattern and the single-pixel detector measures the intensity of light beams that reaches its surface.
A majority of papers concerning CS rely on a discretization of the measurement process or heuristics to adopt a continuous-domain inverse problem to a finite-dimensional CS setting. A discrete measurement model of a continuous measurement process is often an approximation that can lead to bad signal reconstructions. Furthermore, it is typically assumed that the observed signal is discretized in a pixel-bypixel basis and represented by its pointwise values. Such an assumption additionally contributes to the error related to the reconstruction of the underlying continuous-time signal. The Nyquist-Shannon model of the underlying signal may not be the best solution, since signals are often much better represented in other SI bases, such as splines [4], [5]. Recently, a framework for CS of one-dimensional signals that lie in an arbitrary SI subspace was reported in [21] and [22]. The framework links the theories of generalized sampling in SI spaces and CS, leading to an exact discretization of inherently continuous-domain inverse problems in devices specialized for CS where the sampling kernel spans an SI subspace (e.g., the random demodulator [41]).
B. Single-Pixel Compressive Imaging in SI Spaces Single-pixel imaging modulates a scene with a sequence of spatially resolved patterns and measures
the intensities of the correlations between the patterns and the scene [23], [24]. A simple illustration of single-pixel imaging is given in Fig. 3. Typically, the modulation is implemented by the DMDs, consisting of an array of individually addressable micromirrors that redirects the illumination or the light beams. The DMD is implemented as a programmable binary mask, where the value of one corresponds to full illumination of a scene (or redirection of a beam to the detector), and the value of zero means that the illumination (or the light beam) is blocked. A common approach is to use a sequence of orthogonal binary masks, e.g., the Hadamard basis, or ±1 random Bernoulli masks, and measure the differential intensity for each pattern and its photographic negative. The single-pixel detector integrates the light photons which

fall on its surface and converts them into electrons whose number will be directly proportional to the

intensity of the modulated scene.

Let us define the box function, which is also referred to as the B-spline of order zero, as:

The DMD measurement masks can be modeled as two-dimensional functions {zm(u, v)}M m=1 that lie in an SI subspace Z spanned by the integer shifts of a separable sampling kernel (u, v) = b0(u)b0(v). Any

spatially resolved pattern in Z is given in the form

K-1 L-1

zm(u, v) =

sm[k, l](u - k, v - l),

(26)

k=0 l=0

where sm[k, l] are the expansion coefficients of values ±1, and the (K, L) pair determines the resolution

of the measurement masks. By assuming that a scene model f (u, v)  V(20) is given by (20), a single

measurement ym in a single-pixel imaging system is of the form

The integration interval [0, K] × [0, L] covers the whole support of measurement masks, i.e., it covers

the support of exactly K × L basis functions that span the space Z. Thus, we can use the inner product

and the one-dimensional sampling kernel (t) = b0(t), defined in (15). Finally, by applying (23), the

measurement is given by a weighted linear combination of the samples in generalized SI sampling

where S is an M × N measurement matrix, for N = KL, whose rows consist of the coefficients {sm[k, l]}M m=1. Consequently, c  RN is a vector form of the samples c[k, l]. In single-pixel imaging, the number of measurement patterns is often M < N , leading to an ill-posed system of equations. The theory of CS has been extensively used in order to reconstruct the image from a reduced set of measurements. In the sequel, we will offer a solution for image reconstruction from y by using CS via exact wavelet frames that intuitively complements the proposed model of the underlying signal.

C. Wavelet-Domain Sparse Reconstruction Measurements y in (30) can be expressed in the form

y = SR a(0),

(31)

where R is a convolution matrix representing an implementation of the two-dimensional convolution with the sampled cross-correlation sequence r[k], and a(0) is a vector form of the expansion coefficients a(0)[k, l]. If we denote the number of nonzero elements in r[k] with  = card{r[k] | r[k] = 0}, where card is a set cardinality, the dimension of the matrix R is N × N~ , for N~ = (K +  - 1)(L +  - 1), and consequently, a(0) is an N~ × 1 vector.
Numerous papers, e.g., [16]­[19], assume that an observed signal is sparse in an alternative SI basis to the traditional Fourier basis. That is, these works use a prior that the signal can be faithfully represented with only a few nonzero expansion coefficients in a certain SI basis, such as the B-spline function space. We can exploit the same assumption in combination with our measurement model in (31) and recover the expansion coefficients a(0) by solving (24), for  := SR and x := a(0). However, we take a different approach.
In this paper, an SI basis (u, v) provides an underlying model of the observed continuous-time signal that may not be sparse when represented with the corresponding approximation coefficients a(0)[k, l]. Instead, a(0)[k, l] are assumed to be sparse in a certain transform basis . While the choice of the transform basis can be arbitrary, and usually based on a signal prior [22], an intuitive option is a wavelet basis that complements the scaling function (u, v). Moreover, such a pair of wavelet and scaling functions leads to an exact discretization of a continuous-domain inverse problem into a finite CS setting, where the recovered sequence corresponds to the coefficients in (22) obtained by the twodimensional wavelet decomposition. While CS reconstruction with a wavelet-based sparsity domain has been considered previously [42]­[44], the resulting methods assume the bandlimited signal model whose discrete pointwise values (x) are reconstructed by solving (24). Here, we use an SI signal model whose

15

generator is a scaling function corresponding to a specific wavelet, which leads to the reconstruction of
the approximation coefficients a(0)[k, l] of an observed continuous-domain signal. Consider a signal f (u, v)  V(20) given by (20), whose wavelet decomposition is of the form (22).
By using discrete-time synthesis filters v[k] and w[k] whose z-transforms are V (z) and W (z) (see Fig. 1), one can construct a synthesis inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) matrix   RN~×N~ . The approximation coefficients a(0) of the signal f (u, v) are then given by

a(0) = x,

(32)

where x = [aT(I), dTu(I), dTv(I), dTuv(I), dTu(I-1), . . . , dTuv(1)]T is an N~ × 1 vector of wavelet decomposition coefficients. The measurements y in (31) can be expanded to

y = SR x,

(33)

where  := SR  is an M × N~ sensing matrix. We exploit the sparsity prior by using the CS framework and reconstruct the coefficients by solving an optimization problem

where the 1-norm regularization promotes sparse solutions.

Traditional CS is concerned with the RIP, a strict condition on a sensing matrix  that preserves the

geometry and guarantees an exact recovery of the Q-sparse vector x [10], [38]. However, over the years,

the RIP has proven to be too strong an assumption, especially in practical CS applications where the

exact recovery is almost impossible to achieve [40], [45]. Instead, a rather mild condition, similar to the

Riesz-basis condition, is enough to be met to ensure stable recovery [46]

for constants 0 <    < . In this paper, the sampling kernel and the signal generator are imposed to

form Riesz bases, and thus the sensing matrix  := SR  satisfy the condition (35). A more convenient

property of  that provide a concrete measure of its recovery ability is the mutual coherence. The

mutual coherence of a matrix , denoted µ(), measures the largest absolute correlation between any

Small values of the mutual coherence are preferable as they allow reconstruction of denser vectors x for

the coherence between the measurement and sparsity matrices. The coherence is defined as the maximal

correlation between two matrices G and H as

(37)

where {gi} and {hj} are rows and columns of G and H, respectively. Again, small values of µ(G, H)

are desirable. Random matrices are largely incoherent with any deterministic sparsity matrix [10]. Thus,

random Gaussian and Bernoulli matrices provide universal solutions to the problem of choosing an

appropriate measurement matrix in the CS setting. The implementation of measurement masks with

random i.i.d. values of ±1 in single-pixel imaging is straightforward with the DMD. In the proposed

framework, the sparsity matrix is , and S and R together form the measurement matrix, since R is

based on the measurement setup and the underlying signal model. The measurement matrix depends on the

cross-correlation between the sampling kernel and the signal generator, which introduces a deterministic

structure within the random entries of S. This might increase the coherence of the sensing matrix

 := SR  in comparison with the coherence between the conventional pair µ(S, ). However, for

specific SI basis functions used in the experiments, random measurement matrices are adequate choice

that secures low coherence and quality reconstruction results from a small number of CS measurements.

Notice that the recovered expansion coefficients a(0) are not necessarily the pointwise values of the signal reconstruction. They can be seen as a parametric representation of the underlying continuous-time

signal obtained directly from a reduced set of linear measurements. When represented in an appropriate SI

basis, the recovered signal can be processed directly in that domain without the need of transforming the

coefficients into the pointwise values. B-splines are an alternative approach to the conventional bandlimited

theory which offers many practical advantages in signal and image processing [6]. The underlying signal

model are polynomials that are more suitable for operations like convolution or differentiation than

computing discrete approximations to these mathematical constructions. Such operations are efficiently

implemented with FIR filters [32], [33]. If one desires a pointwise representation of the signal, it can also

be obtained by FIR filtering of the recovered coefficients a(0), as described in Section III. Furthermore, B-splines are scaling functions of the biorthogonal wavelets [29] that are commonly used in the coding

applications because of its symmetric filters with compact support. The biorthogonal wavelets are an

intuitive complement of the B-spline basis functions and will be used to construct sparsity domains in

the rest of the paper. However, notice that the proposed framework is not solely limited to the biorthogonal

wavelets nor B-spline basis functions.

VI. ALGORITHMIC DETAILS AND IMPLEMENTATION
It is quiet costly to implement random measurement matrices in practical large-scale compressive imaging applications since they require huge memory allocation, because of their unstructured nature, and necessitate many multiplications in the order of O(M N ). There are several articles proposing methods to overcome these issues and, in this paper, we realize efficient measurement matrices by implementing the structurally-random-matrix (SRM) framework [47]. We use the matrix-free interior point method (mfIPM) [48] for solving large-scale CS optimization problems, which exploits the ability of the signal processing matrices to perform inexpensive matrix-vector multiplications that are typically in the order of O(N~ ) to O(N~ log N~ ). Finally, the proposed CS framework is conducted on the standard test images and measurements obtained by the sensing system proposed in [49].

A. Structurally Random Measurement Matrix A structurally random measurement matrix S is defined as a product of three matrices [47]:

S = DF P ,

(38)

where · P  RN×N is a uniform random permutation matrix which scrambles the signal's sample locations. · F  RN×N is a Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT) matrix, in that SRM's entries only take values of ±1 for compatibility with the hardware implementation. · D  RM×N is a subsampling matrix which randomly picks up M rows of the matrix F P .
These matrices can be efficiently realized with their non-matrix counterparts that require only a small amount of memory storage. The costs of permutation and random subsampling are in the orders of O(N ) and O(M ), respectively. The fast WHT is efficiently realized with complexity in the order of O(N log N ) by only using the operations of additions and subtractions. The SRM performance in the CS setting is theoretically on average comparable to that of the completely random matrix, leading to a low-coherent pair of measurement and sparsity matrices [47]. A normalized WHT matrix has all the rows with zero
 sum of entries except for the first one, whose entries are all equal to 1/ N . If the observed signal is not zero-mean, the first row should be included in the subset of selected rows to encode its average value.

B. Matrix-Free Reconstruction Algorithm In this paper, we use mfIPM to recover an observed signal from a reduced set of linear measurements.
The solver is robust and designed for sparse signal reconstruction problems that arise in the filed of CS. It uses a matrix-free approach that avoids the need to explicitly formulate and store the Newton system

of equations [48]. The mfIPM, as well as many other iterative 1-minimization problem solvers, spends the majority of computational time to determine matrix-vector multiplications x and T x, where  is

a sensing matrix. In the proposed framework, by using the notation of SRM, the problem of computing

x is given by

x = DF P R x,

(39)

where all of the matrices have their non-matrix counterparts. Recall that R is a matrix form of separable two-dimensional convolution with a cross-correlation sequence r[k], and  is a matrix form of the twodimensional synthesis IDWT. The costs of the two-dimensional separable convolution and fast IDWT are in the order of O(N~ ) and O(N~ ), respectively. Notice that the number of nonzero elements  in the sequence r[k] is rather small when the signal generator is a B-spline basis function of a low order p. B-splines of degree p are obtained by repeatedly convolving b0(t) in (25) with itself, defined recursively as bp(t) = bp-1  b0(t), for p  N1. The entries of the cross-correlation sequence r[k] for B-spline signal generators of orders p = 0, . . . , 3 are given in Table I. For a B-spline signal generator of order 0, the cross-correlation sequence r[k] = [k], since the sampling kernel and the generator are orthonormal. This results in R = I, where I is an identity matrix, and the signal reconstruction corresponds to the conventional problem of CS type where  := S. Fast IDWT is efficiently computed by FIR filtering for synthesis spline wavelets of compact support [29], [30], whose scaling functions are B-splines.
In order to compute T x, we have to determine the transposes of all the matrices in (39). The transpose of the SRM is straightforward, since the normalized WHT matrix is unitary. The R matrix has the transpose that is again a separable two-dimensional convolution with the same sequence r[k]. However, in the forward model x, we compute only parts of the convolution that are calculated without zero-padded edges, and in the transpose, we compute the full convolution with zero-padded edges. The transpose of  is implemented by using the fast DWT algorithm with the same synthesis filters used in

the IDWT. The structure of the SRM, and the low-cost convolution and DWT algorithms are exploited not only to speed up the signal reconstruction, but to even allow CS of large-scale images on a standard performance computer by saving memory space.
C. Measurement Setups for Single-Pixel Compressive Imaging We conduct the proposed CS framework, with the algorithm described above, on a set of publicly
available standard test images. The images, namely cameraman, Lena, peppers, pirate, Barbara and boat, are originally of size 512 × 512. We simulate the single-pixel measurement procedure by multiplying a test image with 512 × 512 measurement masks of ±1s, such that each image pixel has its corresponding mask pixel. A single measurement ym is obtained by summing the pixels of the image modulated with the m-th measurement mask.
Additionally, we test the proposed CS framework on real-world data obtained by the imaging system reported in [49]. The sensing system consists of a high-resolution digital projector and an off-the-shelf camera. The digital projector illuminates a scene with 256 × 256 masks and measurement data are acquired by the "single-pixel" camera. For low-detail scenes, good reconstruction results can be obtained from a small number of linear measurements. The S matrix is an SRM obtained by using the WHT and consisting of ±1s. In order to implement such patterns using the projector, we separately illuminate the scene with the positive and negative components of the masks, and define the measurements as y = ypos - yneg. This differential approach noticeably reduces the background signal noise and especially the illumination noise. However, for complex scenes with a lot of details, the number of measurements is enormous if one wants to obtain high-quality reconstruction results in 256 × 256 resolution. In order to efficiently and realistically simulate measurements for a high-detail scene, we use the principle of dual photography [50] and estimate light transport matrix (LTM) between the camera and the projector by following the procedure reported in [35]. We compute the high-resolution LTM between the projector of resolution 256 × 256 and the camera of resolution 128 × 128 with only a fraction of measurements and use it to calculate the light transport between the projector and an imaginary single-pixel detector at the camera location. Consequently, the single-pixel measurements are computed by yT = T ST , where T is a 1 × N light transport vector and S is an SRM of ±1s. Additionally, we use high-resolution LTMs to obtain faithful ground truths of the acquired scenes.
VII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We assess the image reconstruction quality of the proposed CS framework for various settings and compare it to the recovery ability of conventional CS. In the experiments, we use B-spline signal

generators of order p = 0, 1, 2, 3 that correspond to piecewise constant, linear, quadratic and cubic splines, respectively. Note that the proposed framework matches conventional single-pixel compressive imaging for B-spline of order 0. This setting is used mainly for the comparison of the frameworks. There are various complements of the B-spline scaling functions amongst spline wavelets. Here, we employ the biorthogonal wavelets reported in [29], which are very popular in image coding. The biorthogonal wavelets are denoted with biorNr.Nd, where Nr and Nd are numbers of vanishing moments for the synthesis and analysis filters, respectively. A wavelet with Nr vanishing moments is orthogonal to polynomials of degree Nr - 1, and a synthesis scaling function of biorNr.Nd lies in an SI subspace spanned by the B-spline of order p = Nr - 1.
A. Numerical Experiments
First, we conduct the proposed framework on a set of standard test images. The reconstruction quality is assessed for various numbers of measurements that are computed by the simulation of single-pixel imaging described in Section VI-C. We define a measurement ratio mr = M/N as the ratio between the number of measurement masks M and the number of pixels N = KL in the masks, and select ten numbers M that correspond to the ratios mr = 5%, 10%, . . . , 50%. Same measurement masks are used for different orders p of the B-spline basis functions in order to reject the impact of a random matrix realization on the reconstruction ability. Image reconstruction is obtained by solving the proposed 1minimization problem in (34). The regularization parameter  is determined experimentally for every setting, such that it leads to the best reconstruction results in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Reconstruction quality is assessed in terms of the PSNR in decibels and structural similarity index measure (SSIM).
Reconstruction results of the test images for various settings and the bior2.2 wavelets are given by the bar charts in Fig. 4. The scaling function for bior2.2 is the B-spline of order 1. When the approximation function (t) = b1(t), the inverse problem is exactly discretized in a sense that an input signal is decomposed by the continuous-domain wavelet functions and the recovered vector x contains the coefficients given in (22). For other B-spline basis functions, the approximation coefficients a(0) can also be assumed as sparse in the same wavelet domain. However, x obtained in this way does not represent the coefficients that can be obtained by the wavelet decomposition in (22), but a certain discrete transform of the approximation sequence a(0). The same can be applied to the bior4.4 wavelets whose reconstruction results for various settings are given in Fig. 5. In both Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, from the charts, it can be seen that the B-spline approximation functions b1(t), b2(t) and b3(t) achieve better results in terms of the PSNR than b0(t), which is associated with the conventional CS setting. Even though b0(t) is

VIII. RELATED WORK In [16] and [17], analog signals are assumed to lie in unions of SI subspaces. An SI signal model is used to exactly discretize a continuous-domain inverse problem and to induce sparsity which is modeled by assuming that only a few out of all generators are active. Compressive sensing is employed in order to reduce the number of analog filters preceding sampling at the rate of innovation. The framework can

June 2, 2021

DRAFT

24
be extended to a special case of sampling of analog signals that lie in an SI space spanned by a single generator. However, this leads to a signal model whose expansion coefficients are assumed sparse in a sense that only a few of them are nonzero. The authors propose analog filters with sampling kernels that are linear combinations of the shifts of a function biorthogonal to a generator. Such filters may be quite difficult to implement in hardware, especially in imaging modalities, and are often approximated which introduces errors in the system.
Unser et al. [18] introduce a method for solving continuous-domain inverse problems with sparse spline solutions by using the total-variation regularization. As demonstrated in [19] and [20], which are papers that rely on the main results of [18], the grid-based discretization strategies lead to convex optimization problems that can be efficiently solved. The framework exploits an assumption that the signal has a low innovation rate, i.e., the innovation occurs only at a few locations out of all on some predefined grid. The signal model can be interpreted as a spline that has a small number of nonzero expansion coefficients.
In [22], the authors propose a SI signal model for an exact discretization of one-dimensional continuoustime inverse problems. The underlying signal is assumed to lie in a single SI subspace, but contrarily to the works mentioned above, the SI model does not induce sparsity. Instead, it introduces an alternative approach to the Nyquist-Shannon signal model, which is conventionally assumed in CS. In order to employ CS, the authors assume that the expansion coefficients, which are not necessarily pointwise values of the signal, are sparse in a certain discrete transform domain. The paper reinterprets the random demodulator [41] as a system for CS of signals in more general class of SI subspaces. The emphasis is put on the generalization of the system to arbitrary sampling kernels and conditions on the boundaries of integration intervals.
In this paper, we use an SI signal model to recast a two-dimensional continuous-domain inverse problem as a finite dimensional CS problem in an exact way. The proposed framework fits perfectly to the concept of single-pixel imaging. The emphasis is put on the multiresolution analysis that yields complement sparsity bases to the B-spline representation functions. When a representation function corresponds to a certain wavelet scaling function, the problem of signal decomposition is exact. Additionally, we offer an efficient implementation that can be used for reconstruction of large-scale images. Finally, extensive experiments were conducted on the standard test images and data obtained by a real acquisition system.
IX. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION We proposed a novel framework for single-pixel imaging via CS. The paper successfully links the theories of CS and generalized sampling in SI spaces. The SI property of the underlying continuousdomain signal model leads to an exact discretization of the ill-posed inverse problem. Such a model

June 2, 2021

DRAFT

25
perfectly fits the CS paradigm, where the 1-norm regularization promotes sparse solutions. In order to induce sparsity, we exploit the assumption that the expansion coefficients of the underlying signal are sparse in a certain sparsity domain.
Traditionally, the signal is assumed to be bandlimited, i.e., the underlying signal model rests on the Nyquist-Shannon principles. However, it is just an approximation in the case of single-pixel compressive imaging. We showed that the conventional problem is an exact discretization when the underlying model is B-spline of order 0. In this paper, we proposed a CS framework for a single-pixel camera that uses an arbitrary SI signal model and showed that B-splines of higher orders lead to efficient implementations and better reconstruction results in comparison to the conventional setting. Furthermore, directly recovered B-spline signal representation is an alternative approach whose polynomial interpretation offers many practical advantages in image processing applications.
The fact that the B-splines correspond to scaling functions in spline wavelet frames has led us to use the biorthogonal wavelets as sparsity-inducing dictionaries. We proved that the coefficients recovered by solving the CS optimization problem are wavelet coefficients corresponding to the orthogonal projections of the signal onto the continuous-domain analysis wavelet functions when the B-spline representation function is equal to the scaling function. However, the extensive experimental results have shown that, in general, higher orders of B-spline representation functions yield better reconstructions even when the scaling function corresponds to a B-spline of low order. That is, it is more important to choose a proper underlying signal model than to match the representation function with the scaling function of a frame.
We offered an efficient matrix-free implementation of the proposed framework and conducted it on synthetic and real-world measurement data. The experiments have shown that the proposed framework overachieves the conventional one in both noise-free synthetic and noisy real-world scenarios.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Ivan Ralasic´ for providing codes for the off-the-shelf compressive imaging system and fruitful discussion on the system parameters and geometry, and to Professor Sven Loncaric´ for lending an industrial camera and a projector for the experiments.
