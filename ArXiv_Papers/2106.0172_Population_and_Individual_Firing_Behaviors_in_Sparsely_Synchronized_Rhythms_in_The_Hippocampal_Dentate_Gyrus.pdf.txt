We investigate population and individual firing behaviors in sparsely synchronized rhythms (SSRs) in a spiking neural network of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). The main encoding granule cells (GCs) are grouped into lamellar clusters. In each GC cluster, there is one inhibitory (I) basket cell (BC) along with excitatory (E) GCs, and they form the E-I loop. Winner-take-all competition, leading to sparse activation of the GCs, occurs in each GC cluster. Such sparsity has been thought to enhance pattern separation performed in the DG. During the winner-take-all competition, SSRs are found to appear in each population of the GCs and the BCs through interaction of excitation of the GCs with inhibition of the BCs. Sparsely synchronized spiking stripes appear successively with the population frequency fp (= 13 Hz) in the raster plots of spikes. We also note that excitatory hilar mossy cells (MCs) control the firing activity of the GC-BC loop by providing excitation to both the GCs and the BCs. SSR also appears in the population of MCs via interaction with the GCs (i.e., GC-MC loop). Population behaviors in the SSRs are quantitatively characterized in terms of the synchronization measures. In addition, we investigate individual firing activity of GCs, BCs, and MCs in the SSRs. Individual GCs exhibit random spike skipping, leading to a multi-peaked interspike-interval histogram, which is well characterized in terms of the random phase-locking degree. In this case, population-averaged mean-firing-rate (MFR) fi(GC) is less than the population frequency fp. On the other hand, both BCs and MCs show "intrastripe" burstings within stripes, together with "interstripe" random spike skipping. Thus, the population-averaged MFR fi(X) (X = MC and BC) is larger than fp, in contrast to the case of the GCs. MC loss may occur during epileptogenesis. With decreasing the fraction of the MCs, changes in the population and individual firings in the SSRs are also studied. Finally, quantitative association between the population/individual firing behaviors in the SSRs and the winner-take-all competition is discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION
The hippocampus, composed of the dentate gyrus (DG) and the areas CA3 and CA1, plays important roles in memory formation, storage, and retrieval [1, 2]. The DG is the first subregion of the hippocampus, and its primary granule cells (GCs) receive excitatory inputs from the entorhinal cortex (EC) through the perforant paths (PPs). As a pre-processor for the CA3, the GCs perform pattern separation on the input patterns from the EC by sparsifying and orthogonalizing them (i.e., transforming a set of input patterns into sparser and orthogonalized patterns), and project the pattern-separated outputs to the pyramidal cells in the CA3 via the mossy fibers (MFs) [3­27]. The sparse, but relatively strong MFs are known to play a role of "teaching inputs" which tend to trigger synaptic plasticity between the pyramidal cells in the CA3 and also between the pyramidal cells and the EC cells [11, 12, 14, 17, 18]. Then, a new pattern may be stored in modified synapses. In this way, pattern separation in the DG facilitates pattern storage in the CA3.

The whole GCs are grouped into the lamellar clusters [28­31]. In each GC cluster, there is one inhibitory (I) basket cell (BC) along with excitatory (E) GCs, and they form a dynamical E-I loop. During the process of pattern separation, the GCs make sparse firing activity via the winner-take-all competition [6, 11, 14, 16, 32­41]. Only strongly active GCs survive under the feedback inhibition of the BC (i.e., they become winners), while weakly active GCs become silent in response to the feedback inhibition from the BC. The sparsity has been thought to enhance the pattern separation [11­14, 16­20].
Here, we are concerned about population rhythms in the DG. For example, gamma rhythms were observed to appear for communication between the DG and the EC, and between the DG and the CA3 [42, 43]. Also, decrease in the amplitude of theta rhythm and increase in the amplitude of beta rhythm were observed in the DG while performing different associative tasks via presentation of meaningful cues [44]. In this paper, we consider a spiking neural network of the hippocampal DG. During the winner-take-all competition, sparsely synchronized rhythms (SSRs) are found to emerge in each population of the GCs and the BCs via interaction of excitation of the GCs and inhibition of the BCs. Similar sparselysynchronized population rhythms were observed in the hippocampus, the neocortex, the cerebellum, and the ol-

2

factory system [45­48].
We investigate the population and individual behaviors in the SSRs. Sparsely synchronized stripes (composed of spikes and indicating population synchronization) appear successively in the raster plot of spikes, and the corresponding instantaneous spike rates (IPSRs) exhibit oscillatory behaviors with the population frequency fp (= 13 Hz). In addition to the excitatory GCs, there exist another type of excitatory hilar mossy cells (MCs), in contrast to the case of the CA3 and the CA1 with only one type of excitatory pyramidal cells. The MCs control the firing activity of the GC-BC loop by providing excitation to both the GCs and the BCs. SSR is also found to appear in the population of MCs via interaction with the GCs (i.e., GC-MC loop). Thus, in the whole DG network, SSRs appear in the populations of the GCs, the MCs, and the BCs, together with occurrence of the winner-take-all competition, leading to sparse activation of the GCs (enhancing the pattern separation).
Population behaviors in the SSRs are quantitatively characterized by employing diverse synchronization measures introduced in our prior works. The overall synchronization degree for the SSR may be well measured in terms of a thermodynamic amplitude measure, given by the time-averaged amplitude of the macroscopic IPSR [49]. In addition, we use the statistical-mechanical spiking measure, given by the product of the occupation degree (representing the spike density in each stripe) and the pacing degree between the spikes [50], and make intensive characterization of the SSRs.
We also study the individual firing behaviors of the GCs, the MCs, and the BCs in the SSRs. Active GCs exhibit intermittent spikings, phase-locked to the IPSR at random multiples of the global period of the IPSR. As a result, the inter-spike-interval (ISI) histogram consists of "interstripe" skipping peaks. Similar skipping phenomena of spikings (characterized with multi-peaked ISI histograms) were also observed in the case of fast sparse synchronization occurring in the systems consisting of the two excitatory and inhibitory populations or in the single inhibitory population [51­55]. Due to random spike skipping, population-averaged mean-firingrate (MFR) fi(GC) (= 2 Hz) becomes less than the population frequency fp. We also introduce a new random phase-locking degree and characterize the random spike skipping. In contrast to the GCs, both MCs and BCs exhibit "intrastripe" burstings within stripes, along with "interstripe" random spike skipping. Hence, the ISI histogram becomes composed of the dominant intrastripe bursting peak and the interstripe skipping peaks. Due to the dominant intrastripe bursting peak, the populationaveraged MFR fi(X) (X = MC and BC) is larger than fp, in contrast to the case of the GCs.
Finally, we note that death of hilar MCs may occur during epileptogenesis [56, 57]. We decrease the fraction of the MCs, and study how the population and individual firings in the SSRs change. Quantitative correlation between the population/individual firing behaviors in the

FIG. 1: Box diagram for the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) network. Lines with triangles and circles denote excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively. In the DG, there are the granular layer [consisting of GC (granule cell) and BC (basket cell)] and the hilus [composed of MC (mossy cell) and HIPP (hilar perforant path-associated) cell]. The DG receives excitatory input from the EC (entorhinal cortex) via PPs (perforant paths) and provides its output to the CA3 via MFs (mossy fibers).

SSRs and the winner-take-all competition is also studied. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we de-
scribe a spiking neural network of the hippocampal DG. Then, in the main Sec. III, we investigate population and individual behaviors in the SSRs of the GCs, the MCs, and the BCs. Finally, we give summary and discussion in Sec. IV.

II. SPIKING NEURAL NETWORK OF THE DENTATE GYRUS
In this section, we describe our spiking neural network of the DG. By following our prior approach for the cerebellar spiking neural network [58, 59], we first developed our DG spiking neural network in the work for the winner-take-all competition [60], based on the anatomical and the physiological properties described in [16, 20]. The system parameters for the structure, the single neuron models, and the synaptic currents in the present work are the same as those in the work for the winner-take-all competition; for details on our DG network, refer to Sec. 2 in [60].

A. Framework of The Spiking Neural Network of The Dentate Gyrus
Figure 1 shows the box diagram for our DG network. The granular layer (composed of the excitatory GCs and the inhibitory BCs) and the hilus [consisting of the excitatory MCs and the inhibitory HIPP (hilar perforant path-associated) cells] constitute the DG. Thus, there exist two types of excitatory cells, GCs and MCs, in contrast to the case of the CA3 and CA1 with only one kind of excitatory pyramidal cells. This DG receives the input from the external EC via the PPs and projects its output to the CA3 via the MFs.

3

As in [16, 20], based on the anatomical data, we choose

the numbers of the constituent cells (GCs, BCs, MCs,

and HIPP cells) in the DG and the EC cells and the

connection probabilities between them. In [60], we de-

veloped a scaled-down spiking neural network where the

total number of excitatory GCs (NGC) was 2,000, corre-

sponding

to

1 500

of

the

106

GCs

found

in

rats

[61].

These

GCs were grouped into the Nc (= 100) lamellar clusters

[28­31]. In each GC cluster, there were n(GcC) (= 20) GCs

and one inhibitory BC. Hence, the number of BCs (NBC)

in the whole DG network became 100, corresponding to

1 20

of

NGC.

Thus,

in

each

GC

cluster,

a

dynamical

GC-

BC loop was formed, and the BC (receiving the excitation

from all the GCs) provided the feedback inhibition to all

the GCs.

The EC layer II is the external source providing the

excitatory inputs to the GCs and the HIPP cells via

the PPs. The estimated number of the EC layer II cells

(NEC) is about 200,000 in rats, corresponding to 20 EC cells per 100 GCs [62]. Thus, we chose NEC = 400 in our DG network. Also, the activation degree Da of the EC cells was chosen as 10% [63]. Thus, we randomly chose 40

active ones among the 400 EC (layer II) cells. Each active

EC cell was modeled in terms of the Poisson spike train

with frequency of 40 Hz [64]. The random-connection probability p(GC,EC) (p(HIPP,EC)) from the pre-synaptic

EC cells to a post-synaptic GC (HIPP cell) was 20 %.

Thus, each GC or HIPP cell was randomly connected

with the average number of 80 EC cells.

Next, we consider the hilus, composed of the excitatory

MCs and the inhibitory HIPP cells [16, 19, 20, 65­71]. In

rats, the number of MCs (NMC) is known to change from 30,000 to 50,000, corresponding to 3-5 MCs per 100 GCs

[72]. In our DG network, we chose NMC = 80. Also, the estimated number of HIPP cells (NHIPP) is about 12,000, which corresponds to 2 HIPP cells per 100 GCs. Hence,

we chose NHIPP = 40 in our DG network.

In our DG network, the hilar MCs and the GCs were

mutually connected with 20 % random-connection probabilities p(MC,GC) (GC  MC) and p(GC,MC) (MC 

GC). In this way, the GCs and the MCs formed a dy-

namical E-E loop. All the MCs also provided the excita-

tion to the BC in each GC cluster. Hence, the BC in the

GC cluster received excitatory inputs from all the GCs in

the same GC cluster and from all the MCs. In this way,

the MCs control the firing activity in the GC-BC loop by

providing excitation to both the GCs and the BCs.

We also note that each GC in the GC cluster received

inhibition from the randomly-connected HIPP cells with the connection probability p(GC,HIPP) = 20 %. Hence,

the firing activity of the GCs may be determined through

competition between the excitatory inputs from the EC

cells and from the MCs and the inhibitory inputs from

the HIPP cells.

With the above information on the numbers of the rele-

vant cells and the connection probabilities between them,

we developed a one-dimensional ring network for the DG

[60]. As in the famous small-world ring network [73, 74],

our ring network has advantage for computational and analytical efficiency, and its visual representation may also be easily made. For the schematic diagrams of the ring networks for the EC, the granular layer and the hilus, refer to Figs. 1(b1)-1(b3) in [60], respectively.

B. Elements and Synaptic Currents in The DG Spiking Neural Network

As elements of our DG spiking neural network, we chose leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron models with additional afterhyperpolarization (AHP) currents which determines refractory periods, like our prior study of cerebellar network [58­60]. This LIF neuron model is one of the simplest spiking neuron models [75]. Due to its simplicity, it may be easily analyzed and simulated.
Evolutions of dynamical states of individual cells in the X population are governed by the following equations:

CX

dvi(X) dt

= -IL(X,i)-IA(XH)P,i+Ie(xXt)-Is(yXn),i,

i = 1, · · · , NX . (1)

Here, NX is the total number of cells in the X popula-

tion, X = GC and BC in the granular layer and X = MC

and HIPP in the hilus. In Eq. (1), CX (pF) represents the membrane capacitance of the cells in the X popula-

tion, and the state of the ith cell in the X population at

a time t (msec) is characterized by its membrane poten-

tial vi(X) (mV). The time-evolution of vi(X)(t) is governed by 4 types of currents (pA) into the ith cell in the X

population; the leakage current IL(X,i), the AHP current
IA(XH)P,i, the external constant current Ie(xXt) (independent
of i), and the synaptic current Is(yXn),i. Here, a subthresh-
old case of Ie(xXt) = 0 was considered for all X [20]. The 1st type of leakage current IL(X,i) for the ith cell in
the X population is given by:

IL(X,i)(t) = gL(X)(vi(X)(t) - VL(X)).

(2)

Here, gL(X) and VL(X) are conductance (nS) and reversal potential for the leakage current, respectively. The
ith cell fires a spike when its membrane potential vi(X) reaches a threshold vt(hX) at a time tf(X,i). Then, the 2nd
type of AHP current IA(XH)P,i follows after spiking (i.e.,
t  t(fX,i)), :

IA(XH)P,i(t) = gA(XH)P (t) (vi(X)(t) - VA(XH)P ) for t  t(fX,i).
(3)
Here, VA(XH)P is the reversal potential for the AHP current, and the conductance gA(XH)P (t) is given by an exponentialdecay function:

gA(XH)P (t) = g¯A(XH)P e . -(t-tf(X,i))/A(XH)P

(4)

Here, g¯A(XH)P and A(XH)P are the maximum conductance and the decay time constant for the AHP current. As A(XH)P is increased, the refractory period becomes longer.
For the parameter values of the capacitance CX , the leakage current IL(X), and the AHP current, refer to Table 1 in [60]; these parameter values are based on physiologi-
cal properties of the GC, BC, MC, and HIPP cell [20, 67].
We next consider the synaptic current Is(yXn),i into the ith cell in the X population, composed of the following
3 types of synaptic currents:

Is(yXn),i = IA(XM,YPA) ,i + IN(XM,YDA) ,i + IG(XA,BZA) ,i.

(5)

Here, IA(XM,YPA) ,i and IN(XM,YDA) ,i are the excitatory AMPA (-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor-mediated and NMDA (N -methyl-D-aspartate) receptor-mediated currents from the pre-synaptic source Y population to the post-synaptic ith neuron in the target X population. On the other hand, IG(XA,BZA) ,i is the inhibitory GABAA (-aminobutyric acid type A) receptormediated current from the pre-synaptic source Z population to the post-synaptic ith neuron in the target X population.
Like the case of the AHP current, the R (= AMPA, NMDA, or GABA) receptor-mediated synaptic current IR(T,i,S) from the pre-synaptic source S population to the ith post-synaptic cell in the target T population is given by:

IR(T,i,S)(t) = gR(T,i,S)(t) (vi(T )(t) - VR(S)).

(6)

Here, g((RT,,Si))(t) and VR(S) are synaptic conductance and synaptic reversal potential (determined by the type of the pre-synaptic source S population), respectively.
We get the synaptic conductance gR(T,i,S)(t) from:

NS

gR(T,i,S)(t) = KR(T,S)

wi(jT,S) s(jT,S)(t).

(7)

j=1

Here, KR(T,S) is the synaptic strength per synapse for the R-mediated synaptic current from the jth pre-synaptic
neuron in the source S population to the ith post-
synaptic cell in the target T population. The inter-
population synaptic connection from the source S popu-
lation (with Ns cells) to the target T population is given by the connection weight matrix W (T,S) (= {wi(jT,S)}) where wi(jT,S) = 1 if the jth cell in the source S population is pre-synaptic to the ith cell in the target T population; otherwise wi(jT,S) = 0.
The post-synaptic ion channels are opened because of
binding of neurotransmitters (emitted from the source S
population) to receptors in the target T population. The
fraction of open ion channels at time t is represented by s(T,S). The time course of s(jT,S)(t) of the jth cell

4

in the source S population is given by a sum of double exponential functions ER(T,S)(t - t(fj) - R(T,l,S)):

Fj(s)

s(jT,S)(t) =

ER(T,S)(t - t(fj) - R(T,l,S)).

(8)

f =1

Here, t(fj) and Fj(s) are the f th spike time and the total number of spikes of the jth cell in the source S pop-
ulation, respectively, and R(T,l,S) is the synaptic latency time constant for R-mediated synaptic current. The
exponential-decay function ER(T,S)(t) (corresponding to contribution of a pre-synaptic spike occurring at t = 0 in
the absence of synaptic latency) is given by:

ER(T ,S ) (t)

=

R(T,d,S)

1 - R(T,r,S)

e - e -t/R(T,d,S)

-t/R(T,r,S)

·(t).

(9)

Here, (t) is the Heaviside step function: (t) = 1 for

t  0 and 0 for t < 0, and R(T,r,S) and R(T,d,S) are synaptic rising and decay time constants of the R-mediated

synaptic current, respectively.

For the parameter values for the synaptic strength per

synapse KR(T,S), the synaptic rising time constant R(T,r,S), synaptic decay time constant R(T,d,S), synaptic latency time constant R(T,l,S), and the synaptic reversal potential VR(S), refer to Tables 2 and 3 in [60]. These parameter values are also based on the physiological properties of

the relevant neurons [20, 76­83].

III. POPULATION AND INDIVIDUAL FIRING BEHAVIORS IN SPARSELY SYNCHRONIZED RHYTHMS
In our DG network shown in Fig. 1, the main encoding GCs are found to exhibit SSR during their winner-takeall competition (leading to sparse activation of the GCs). Also, the MCs and the BCs show SSRs via interaction with the GCs through the GC-MC loop and the GC-BC loop. Population and individual behaviors of these SSRs are investigated in terms of diverse measures for population synchronization and random phase-locking degree for characterization of the ISIs. Quantitative correlations between these behaviors and the winner-take-all competition are shown to exist.

A. Population and Individual Behaviors in the Sparsely Synchronized Rhythm of the GCs
Figure 1 shows the external input from the EC. There are direct excitatory input from the EC cells and indirect disynaptic inhibitory EC input, mediated by the HIPP cells. Thus, the EC cells and the HIPP cells become the

excitatory and the inhibitory input sources to the GCs, respectively.
Among the 400 EC cells, randomly-chosen 40 active cells make spikings (i.e., activation degree Da = 10 %). Each active EC cell is modeled in terms of the Poisson spike train with frequency of 40 Hz. After a break stage (t = 0 - 300 msec), Poisson spike train of each active EC cell follows during the stimulus stage (t = 300 - 30, 300 msec; the stimulus period Ts is 3 · 104 msec).
We note that each HIPP cell is randomly connected to the average number of 80 EC cells with the connection probability p(HIPP,EC) = 20%, among which the average number of active EC cells is 8. Among the 40 HIPP cells, 37 HIPP cells are found to be active, while the remaining 3 HIPP cells (without receiving excitatory input from the active EC cells) are silent; the activation degree of the HIPP cells is 92.5%. Also, the spikings of the active HIPP cells begin from t 320 msec (i.e. about 20 msec delay for the firing of the HIPP cells with respect to the firing onset (t = 300 msec) of the active EC cells).
As a pre-processor for the CA3, the GCs in the DG perform the pattern separation, facilitating the pattern storage in the CA3. The GCs make sparse firing activity through competitive learning, which has been thought to improve the pattern separation. The activation degree of the GCs was found to be Da = 5.2% (i.e., the total number of active GCs is 104) [60]. Also, the active GCs begin to make sparse firings from t 340 msec [i.e. about 40 msec delay for the firing of the GCs with respect to the firing onset (t = 300 msec) of the active EC cells]. Dynamical origin for winner-take-all competition, lead-

ing to the sparse activation of the GCs, has been studied in our prior work [60]. Winner-take-all competition has been found to occur via competition between the firing activity of the GCs and the feedback inhibition of the BC in each GC cluster. In this case, the hilar MCs has also been found to enhance the winner-take-all competition by providing excitation to both the GCs and the BC.
During the winner-take-all competition, SSR is found to appear in the population of the GCs via interaction of excitation of the GCs with inhibition of the BCs. Population firing activity of the active GCs may be well visualized in the raster plot of spikes which is a collection of spike trains of individual active GCs. Figure 2(a1) shows the raster plot of spikes for the active GCs; for convenience, only a part from t = 300 to 1,300 msec is shown in the raster plot of spikes. We note that sparsely synchronized stripes (composed of spikes and indicating population sparse synchronization) appear successively.
As a population quantity showing collective behaviors, we use an instantaneous population spike rate (IPSR) which may be obtained from the raster plots of spikes [50­55]. To get a smooth IPSR, we employ the kernel density estimation (kernel smoother) [84]. Each spike in the raster plot is convoluted (or blurred) with a kernel function Kh(t) to get a smooth estimate of IPSR RGC(t):

RGC(t)

=

1 Na

Na i=1

ni
Kh(t - t(si)),
s=1

(10)

where Na is the number of the active GCs, ts(i) is the sth spiking time of the ith active GC, ni is the total number of spikes for the ith active GC, and we use a Gaussian
kernel function of band width h:

Kh(t)

=

1 

e-t2/2h2 ,

2h

-  < t < .

(11)

Throughout the paper, the band width h of Kh(t) is 20 msec. The IPSR RGC(t) of the active GCs is shown in Fig. 2(a2), and we note that RGC(t) exhibits synchronous oscillation with the population frequency fp(GC) (= 13 Hz); in the desynchronized case, the IPSR becomes stationary without oscillation.
In the above way, SSR with the population frequency fp(GC) (= 13 Hz) [i.e., the global period TG(GC) (corresponding to the average period between the neighboring spiking stripes) is 76.9 msec] emerges in the population of active GCs. This is similar to the previously-studied case where fast sparse synchronization occurs via E-I balance in the feedback E-I loop [51­54].
We now characterize population firing behavior in the SSR of the GCs by employing the thermodynamic amplitude measure and the statistical-mechanical spiking measure [49, 50]. The thermodynamic amplitude measure Ma is given by the time-averaged amplitude of the macroscopic IPSR RGC(t) [49]:

Ma = Ai;

Ai =

RG(i)C,max(t) - RG(i)C,min(t) , 2

(12)

6

where the overline represents time average, and RG(i)C,max(t) and RG(i)C,min(t) are the maximum and the minimum of RGC(t) in its ith global cycle (corresponding to the ith spiking stripe). As Ma increases (i.e., the time-averaged amplitude of RGC(t) is increased), the synchronization degree of the SSR becomes higher. Figure
2(b1) shows the plot of the amplitude Ai versus the spiking stripe index i. We follow the 389 stripes during the stimulus period Ts (= 3 · 104 msec), and thus thermodynamic amplitude measure Ma (corresponding to the time-averaged amplitude Ai) is found to be 3.57.
Next, we characterize the population firing behaviors
in terms of the statistical-mechanical spiking measure
[50]. For a synchronous case, spiking stripes appear suc-
cessively in the raster plot of spikes. The spiking measure
Ms,i of the ith stripe is defined by the product of the occupation degree Oi of spikes (denoting the spike density of the ith stripe) and the pacing degree Pi of spikes (representing the degree of phase coherence between spikes
in the ith stripe):

Ms,i = Oi · Pi.

(13)

The occupation degree Oi of spikes in the ith stripe is given by the fraction of spiking neurons:

Oi

=

Ni(s) , Na

(14)

where Ni(s) is the number of spiking cells in the ith stripe, and Na is the total number of active cells (e.g., Na = 104 for the GCs). In the case of sparse synchronization,
Oi < 1, in contrast to the case of full synchronization with Oi = 1.
The pacing degree Pi of spikes in the ith stripe can be determined in a statistical-mechanical way by consider-
ing their contributions to the macroscopic IPSR RGC(t). Central maxima of RGC(t) between neighboring left and right minima of RGC(t) coincide with centers of spiking stripes in the raster plot. A global cycle begins from a
left minimum of RGC(t), passes a maximum, and ends at a right minimum. An instantaneous global phase (t) of
RGC (t) was introduced via linear interpolation in the region forming a global cycle [for details, refer to Eqs. (16)
and (17) in [50]]. Then, the contribution of the kth mi-
croscopic spike in the ith stripe occurring at the time t(ks) to RGC(t) is given by cos k, where k is the global phase at the kth spiking time [i.e., k  (t(ks))]. A microscopic spike makes the most constructive (in-phase)
contribution to RGC(t) when the corresponding global phase k is 2n (n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ). In contrast, it makes the most destructive (anti-phase) contribution to RGC(t) when k is 2(n - 1/2). By averaging the contributions of all microscopic spikes in the ith stripe to RGC(t), we get the pacing degree of spikes in the ith stripe [refer to
Eq. (18) in [50]]:

1 Si

Pi

=

Si

cos k,
k=1

(15)

where Si is the total number of microscopic spikes in the ith stripe. Then, via averaging Ms,i of Eq. (13) over a sufficiently large number Ns of stripes (e.g., Ns = 389 for the GCs), we obtain the statistical-mechanical spiking
measure Ms [refer to Eq. (19) in [50]]:

1 Ns

Ms

=

Ns

Ms,i.
i=1

(16)

Figures 2(b2)-2(b4) show the plots of Oi, Pi, and Ms,i, respectively, in the 15 spiking stripes in Fig. 2(a1). By
following the 389 stripes during the stimulus period Ts (= 3 · 104 msec), we get the average occupation Oi (= 0.14), the average pacing degree Pi (= 0.45), and the statistical-mechanical spiking measure Ms (= 0.063). Since Oi is much less than 1, sparse synchronization occurs. In contrast, moderate pacing ( Pi = 0.45) takes place between spikes in each stripe. Thus, the statistical-
mechanical spiking measure Ms (= 0.063), representing the overall synchronization degree, becomes so small,
mainly due to low occupation degree.
In addition to the population firing behavior, we also
characterize individual spiking behaviors in the SSR. We
obtain the ISI histogram for each active GC by collecting the ISIs during the stimulus period Ts (= 3 · 104 msec), and then get the population-averaged ISI histogram by
averaging the individual ISI histograms for all the active
GCs. Figure 2(c) shows the population-averaged ISI his-
togram. Each active GC exhibits intermittent spikings,
phase-locked to RGC(t) at random multiples of its global period TG(GC) (= 76.9 msec). Due to the random spike skipping, distinct 13 multiple peaks appear at the integer multiples of TG(GC) (denoted by the vertical dotted lines). This is in contrast to the case of full synchroniza-
tion where only one dominant peak appears at the global period TG(GC); all cells fire regularly at each global cycle without skipping. Hereafter, these peaks will be called
as the "interstripe skipping" peaks. The middle 6th- and
7th-order peaks are the highest ones, and hence spik-
ing may occur most probably after 5- or 6-times spike
skipping. This kind of structure in the ISI histogram
is a little different from that in the case of fast sparse
synchronization where the highest peak appears at the
1st-order peak, and then the heights of the higher-order
peaks decrease successively [51­55].
In the case of the active GCs, the average ISI ( ISI )
is 500.01 msec. Hence, the population-averaged MFR fi(GC) (=1/ ISI ) is 2.0 Hz, which is much less than the population frequency fp(GC) (= 13 Hz) of the SSR, in contrast to the case of full synchronization (with full
occupation) where the population-averaged MFR is the
same as the population frequency.
We introduce a new random phase-locking degree, de-
noting how well intermittent spikes make phase-locking to RGC(t) at random multiples of its global period TG(GC), and characterize the degree of random spike skipping seen
in the ISI histogram. By following the approach devel-

7

oped in the case of pacing degree [50], we introduce the random phase-locking degree to examine the regularity of individual firings (represented well in the sharpness of

the interstripe skipping peaks). We first locate the interstripe skipping peaks. The
range of ISI in the nth-order peak is as follows:

(n

TG(GC)

for n  2,

(17)

for n = 1.

(18)

For each nth-order peak, we get the normalized weight wn, given by:

wn

=

NI(SnI) NI(StoI t)

,

(19)

where NI(StoI t) is the total number of ISIs obtained during the stimulus period (Ts = 3 · 104 msec) and NI(SnI) is the number of the ISIs in the nth-order peak. For the GCs,
NI(StoI t) = 6, 218. Figure 2(d1) shows the plot of wn versus n (peak index) for all the 13 peaks. The middle highest
6th and 7th-order peaks have w6 = 0.153 and w7 = 0.154. We now consider the sequence of the ISIs, {ISI(in), i =

1, . . . , NI(SnI)}, within the nth-order peak, and get the random phase-locking degree L(dn) of the nth-order peak. Similar to the case of the pacing degree [50], we provide
a phase  to each ISI(in) via linear interpolation:

(ISI(in)) =

 TG(GC)

ISI(in)

for n  2,

where

ISI(in)

= ISI(in) - n

(21)

Then, the contribution of the ISI(in) to the locking de-

gree L(dn) is given by cos(i(n)); i(n) = (ISI(in)). An

ISI(in) makes the most constructive contribution to Ld(n)

for i(n) = 0, while it makes

By

averaging

no contribution to L(dn) for the matching contributions

of all the ISIs in the nth-order peak, we obtain:

L(dn)

=

1 NI(SnI)

NI(SnI)
cos(i(n)).
i

(22)

Finally, we get the (overall) random phase-locking de-
gree Ld via weighted average of the random phase-locking degrees L(dn) of all the peaks:

Ld

· L(dn)

=

Np NI(StoI t)
cos(i(n)),
n=1 i=1

(23)

where Np is the number of peaks in the ISI histogram.

Thus, Ld corresponds to the average of contributions of

all the ISIs in the ISI histogram. Figure 2(d2) shows the plot of L(dn) versus n (peak index) for the 13 interstripe skipping peaks. In this case, the random phase-locking degree Ld, characterizing the sharpness of all the peaks, is 0.911. Hence, the GCs make intermittent spikes which are well phase-locked to RGC(t) at random multiples of its global period TG(GC).
B. Population and Individual Behaviors in the Sparsely Synchronized Rhythms of the MCs and
The BCs
In our DG network, the GCs and the hilar MCs are mutually connected with the 20% random connection probabilities p(MC,GC) (GC  MC) and p(GC,MC) (MC  GC), which leads to formation of the GC-MC dynamical loop. Then, SSR emerges in the population of the MCs via interaction with the GCs. Also, each BC receives excitation from all the GCs in the same GC clus-

ter, and it provides feedback inhibition to all the GCs. Thus, the GC-BC dynamical loop is formed, and SSR appears in the population of the BCs through interaction with the GCs.
Here, we investigate the population and individual firing behaviors in the SSRs of the MCs and the BCs. Unlike the case of the GCs, all the MCs (NMC = 80) and all the BCs (NBC = 100) are active ones (i.e., their activation degrees Da are 100%) [60]. Their raster plots of spikes and the corresponding IPSRs [i.e., RMC(t) and

8

RBC(t)] are shown in Figs. 3(a1)-3(a2) and Figs. 3(e1)3(e2), respectively. As in the case of the GCs, SSRs with the population frequency fp(X) (= 13 Hz; X = MC and BC) appear in the populations of the MCs and the BCs via interaction in the GC-MC-BC loop, respectively.
We note that the population frequencies of the IPSRs RX (t) (X = GC, MC, and BC) are the same through mutual interaction in the GC-MC-BC loop; for convenience, sometimes we denote the population frequency just as fp without the superscript. However, phase shifts between the SSRs occur as follows. With respect to the excitatory EC input, starting at t = 300 msec, the firings of the GCs begin at a delayed time t = 340 msec. The GCs provide the excitatory inputs to the MCs which then give the excitatory inputs to the BCs. Thus, time-delay occurs for the firings of the MCs and the BCs with respect to the firings of the GCs. This delayed firing of the MCs (BCs) may be seen clearly in the cross-correlation between the IPSR RMC(t) [RBC(t)] and RGC(t);

CX-GC( ) = RGC(t +  )RX (t) ; RG2 C(t) RX2 (t)

X = MC or BC, (24)

where RGC(t) = RGC(t) - RGC(t), RX (t) = RX (t) -
RX (t), and the overline denotes the time average. It is thus found that CMC-GC(t) and CBC-GC(t) have the maxima at  = 10 and 20 msec, respectively. Conse-

quently, the MCs and the BCs begin to fire at delayed

time t = 350 and 360 msec, respectively.

As in the case of the GCs, we characterize population

firing behaviors in the SSRs of the MCs and the BCs.

We first employ the thermodynamic amplitude measure

Ma, given by the time-averaged amplitude of the macroscopic IPSRs, RMC(t) and RBC(t) [49]. Figures 3(b1) and 3(f1) show the plots of the amplitude Ai versus i (spiking stripe index) in the case of the MCs and the

BCs, respectively. We follow the 389 stripes during the stimulus time Ts (= 3 · 104 msec), and thus the thermodynamic amplitude measures Ma (corresponding to the time-averaged amplitude Ai) for the MCs and the BCs are found to be 99.12 and 112.75, respectively, which are

mush larger than Ma (=3.57) for the GCs. Hence, the synchronization degrees of the SSRs for the MCs and the

BCs are much higher (about 30 times) than that for the

GCs.

Next, we use the occupation degree Oi, the pacing degree Pi, and the statistical-mechanical spiking measure Ms,i [50] for characterization of the population firing behaviors in the SSRs of the MCs and the BCs [50]. Figures

3(b2)-3(b4) and Figures 3(f2)-3(f4) show the plots of Oi, Pi, and Ms,i in the ith spiking stripes for the MCs and the BCs, respectively. We follow the 389 stripes during the stimulus period Ts (= 3 · 104 msec), and get the average occupation Oi , the average pacing degree Pi , and the statistical-mechanical spiking measure Ms. The average occupation degrees Oi of the MCs and the BCs are 0.86 and 0.92, respectively, which are much larger (about

9

6 times) than that (= 0.14) of the GCs. However, since Oi of the MCs and the BCs are still less than 1, MCs and BCs also exhibit sparsely synchronized firings, but these firings are much less sparse than those of the GCs.
Also, the average pacing degrees Pi of the MCs and the BCs are 0.73 and 0.77, respectively, which are larger than that (= 0.45) of the GCs; the pacing between spikings for the MCs and the BCs are better than that for the GCs. Consequently, the statistical-mechanical spiking measure Ms (representing the overall degree of population synchronization) of the MCs and the BCs are 0.63 and 0.71, respectively, which are much larger (at least 10 times) than that (= 0.063) of the GCs. As explained in Subsec. III A, Ms for the GCs becomes very small mainly due to low average occupation degree Oi (=0.14) (resulting from the sparse firings of the GCs).
In addition to the population behaviors, we also characterize individual spiking behaviors in the SSRs of the MCs and BCs in terms of their ISIs. Figures 3(c) and 3(g) show the population-averaged ISI histograms for the MCs and the BCs, respectively; these ISI histograms are obtained in the same way as in the GCs. Unlike the case of the GCs, the MCs and the BCs exhibit "intrastripe bursting" (corresponding to repeatedly firing bursts of spikes) within the stripes, in addition to the random spike skipping for the interstripe spikings; no intrastripe bursting occurs for the GCs.
Thus, the ISI histograms consist of the dominant "intrastripe bursting peak" [located near the ISI ( 1.11 msec)], arising from the intrastripe burstings, as well as the interstripe skipping peaks [located at the integer multiples of the global period TG(X) (= 76.9 msec); X = MC and BC], resulting from the random spike skipping for the interstripe spikings; the fractions of the ISIs at the intrastripe bursting peaks are 0.75 and 0.78 for the MCs and the BCs, respectively. In this way, the structure of the ISI histograms for the MCs and the BCs is distinctly different from that for the GCs, due to the occurrence of intrastripe burstings. Consequently, for the MCs (BCs), the average ISI ( ISI ) is 23.7 (18.1) msec, and hence the population-averaged MFR fi(MC) ( fi(BC) ) (=1/ ISI ) is 42.1 (55.4) Hz, which is higher than the population frequency fp (= 13 Hz) of the SSRs, in contrast to the case of the GCs with fi(GC) = 2 Hz (much lower than fp).
As in the case of the GCs, we also characterize the random spike skipping, leading to the interstripe skipping peaks in the ISI histograms, in terms of the random phase locking degree Ld, representing how well intermittent interstripe skipping spikes make phase-locking to RX (t) at random multiples of its global period TG(X) (= 76.9 msec; X = MC and BC). Unlike the case of the GCs (with the 13 peaks), only the 3 (2) interstripe skipping stripes appear for the MCs (BCs), due to appearance of the dominant intrastripe bursting peak. In this case, the normalized weight wn for the nth-order interstripe

skipping peak is given by:

wn

=

NI(SnI,skip) NI(StIot,skip)

,

(25)

where NI(StIot,skip) is the total number of interstripe skipping ISIs and NI(SnI,skip) is the number of the ISIS in the nth-order interstripe skipping peak. Figures 3(d1) and
3(h1) show the plots of the normalized weights wn versus n (peak index) for the MCs and the BCs, respec-
tively. Unlike the GCs, the 1st-order skipping peak is
dominant; w1 = 0.81 and 0.99 for the MCs and the BCs, respectively; the weights of the remaining higher-order
skipping peaks are very low.
We now examine the regularity of individual interstripe
spikings (represented well in the sharpness of the inter-
stripe skipping peaks) in terms of the random phase-
locking degree Ld, introduced in Eq. (23). Figures 3(d2) and 3(h2) show the plots of the random phase-locking degree L(dn) of the nth-order interstripe skipping peak versus n (skipping peak index) for the MCs and the BCs,
respectively. Then, Ld, corresponding to the average of contributions of all the ISIs in the ISI histogram, is given
by the weighted mean of the random phase-locking degrees L(dn) of the nth-order interstripe skipping peak; Ld is 0.936 and 0.941 for the MCs and the BCs, respectively.
Similar to the case of the GC with Ld=0.911, the values of Ld are also very high, which implies that the intermittent interstripe skipping spikes for the MCs and the BCs
are well phase-locked to RX (t) at random multiples of its global period TG(X) (X = MC and BC).

C. Effect of The Hilar MCs on Population and Individual Behaviors in The Sparsely Synchronized
Rhythms
The hilar MCs control the firing activity of the GCBC loop by providing excitation to both the GCs and the BCs. Through such control, the MCs were found to play an important role of enhancing the winner-take-all competition in each GC cluster [60]. However, MC loss may occur during epileptogenesis [56, 57], which might be a cause of impaired pattern separation leading to memory interference. Through ablation of the GCs, we study their effect on the firing behaviors in the SSRs of the GCs, MCs, and BCs.
We decrease NMC (number of the MCs) from 80 (in the original whole network) to 0 (complete loss); in this case, the fraction of MCs (FMC) is given by NMC/80. With decreasing NMC or equivalently FMC in the above way, we investigate change in the population and individual spiking behaviors in the SSRs of the GCs, the MCs, and the BCs, and compare them with those for NMC = 80 (i.e., FMC = 1) in Figs. 2 and 3. It is thus found that the MCs play an essential role to enhance the synchronization degree and the random phase-locking degree in the SSRs.

Vertical dotted lines in the ISI histograms represent the integer multiples of the global period TG(GC) of the SSR; TG(GC) = 73.5, 62.9, 47.4 msec for NMC = 60, 30, and 0, respectively. (c) Plot of the population frequency fp(GC) versus FMC (fraction of MCs). Plots of (d1) the thermodynamic amplitude measure

We first consider the case of SSR of the GCs. Figures 4(a1)-4(a3) show the raster plots of spikes and the IPSRs RGC(t) for NMC = 60 (FMC = 0.75), 30 (FMC = 0.375), and 0 (FMC = 0), respectively. We note that sparsely synchronized spiking stripes appear successively in the rater plot of spikes and the corresponding IPSR RGC(t) exhibits synchronous oscillations. As NMC is decreased, the interval between the neighboring spiking stripes becomes narrower, and hence the population frequency fp(GC) of the SSR becomes increased.
With decreasing NMC from 80, the firing activity of the BCs becomes weakened, which leads to decrease in the feedback inhibition to the GCs. Thus, the activation degree Da of the GCs was found to increase [60]. Due to such increase in the firing activity of the GCs, spikes in the raster plot become more and more dense, as shown in the case of NMC = 60, 30, and 0, which results in increase of the occupation degree Oi (representing the fraction of spiking neurons in each spiking stripe). In contrast,

10
the spiking stripes become more and more smeared, and hence the pacing degree Pi (denoting the degree of phase coherence between spikes) becomes decreased.
Through competition between the occupation and the pacing degrees, the overall synchronization degree of the SSR is determined, which may be well shown in the change in the amplitude Ai of the IPSR RGC(t); Ai in the ith global cycle of RGC(t) (i.e., the ith spiking stripe) is given by the difference between the maximum and the minimum of RGC(t) divided by 2 [see Eq. (12)]. With decreasing NMC, the maximum RG(i)C,max(t) is found to show an increasing tendency, mainly due to the effect of the in-
creased Oi; the time-averaged maximum RG(i)C,max(t) = 7.89, 8.12, and 8.57 for NMC = 60, 30, and 0, respectively. However, the minimum RG(i)C,min(t) exhibits more increasing tendency because of the effects of the increased Oi and the decreased Pi; the time-averaged minimum RG(i)C,min(t) = 1.04, 2.38, and 5.15 for NMC = 60, 30, and 0, respectively. Consequently, with decreasing NMC the thermodynamic amplitude measure Ma (representing the time-averaged amplitude) becomes decreased (i.e., the overall synchronization degree decreases).
By decreasing FMC from 1 to 0, we make more quantitative characterization of the population firing behavior for various values of FMC. Figure 4(c) and Figs. 4(d1)4(d4) show the plot of the population frequency fp(GC) versus FMC and the plots of the amplitude measure Ma, the average occupation degree Oi , the average pacing degree Pi , and the statistical-mechanical spiking measure Ms versus FMC, respectively; all these quantities are obtained by following all the spiking stripes appearing during the stimulus period Ts (= 3 · 104 msec). As a result of the increased firing activity of the GCs, the population frequency fp(GC) is found to increase from 13.0 to 21.1 Hz [see Fig. 4(c)]. The frequency range of the SSR corresponds to the beta rhythm.
The synchronization degree of the SSR with the betarange fp(GC) is characterized in terms of the thermodynamic amplitude measure Ma and the statisticalmechanical spiking measure Ms. As FMC is decreased from 1 to 0, Ma, [representing the time-averaged amplitude of RGC(t)], is found to decrease from 3.57 to 1.71, as shown in Fig. 4(d1). Hence, the overall synchronization degree of the SSR becomes decreased. Due to increase in the firing activity of the GCs with decreasing FMC, the average occupation degree Oi of the spikes becomes increased from 0.14 to 0.18; more dense spikes appear in the raster plot. In contrast, as FMC is decreased, the average pacing degree Pi between the dense spikes is found to decrease from 0.45 to 0.16. Then, the overall synchronization degree of the SSR is determined through competition between the (increasing) occupation and the (decreasing) pacing degrees. In this case, the pacing between the dense spikes becomes much worse, and hence the statistical-mechanical spiking measure Ms, given by the product of the occupation and the pacing degrees, is

found to decrease from 0.063 to 0.028, which is in consistent with the decrease in Ma.
Next, we consider the individual firing behavior in the SSR of the GCs. Figures 4(b1)-4(b3) show the ISI histograms for NMC = 60, 30, and 0, respectively. The GCs exhibit intermittent interstripe spikings, locked to

11
RGC(t) at random multiples of the global period TG(GC) of RGC(t). Due to random spike skipping, the ISI histograms consist of the interstripe skipping peaks. The mean ISIs ( ISI ) are 495, 483, and 455 msec, respectively, in the case of NMC = 60, 30, and 0. Hence, the corresponding population-averaged MFRs fi(GC) (= 1 / ISI ) are 2.02, 2.07, and 2.20 Hz, respectively, due to increased activity of the GCs. Moreover, we also note that, as NMC is decreased, the interstripe skipping peaks become more and more smeared, which results in decrease in the random phase-locking degree Ld [representing the degree of random phase-locking to RGC(t)].
As in the case of the population behavior, with decreasing FMC from 1 to 0, we make more quantitative characterization of the individual firing behavior for various values of FMC. Figures 4(e) and 4(f) show the plots of the population-averaged MFR fi(GC) and the random phase-locking degree Ld, respectively. As FMC is decreased from 1 to 0, fi(GC) (given by the reciprocal of the mean ISI) is found to increase from 2.0 to 2.2 Hz, because of the increased firing activity of the GCs. We note that fi(GC) is much less than the population frequency fp(GC), due to random spike skipping. Also, the random phase-locking degree Ld (characterizing the degree of random spike skipping) is found to exhibit decreasing tendency from 0.91 to 0.64, due to smearing of the interstripe skipping peaks, as in the decrease in the population synchronization degrees, Ma and Ms.
From now on, with decreasing NMC, we study the population and individual firing behaviors in the SSRs of the MCs and the BCs. We first consider the cases of NMC = 60, 30, and 0; NMC = 0 may apply to only the case of the BCs. Figures 5(a1)-5(a2) and Figs. 5(c1)-5(c3) show the raster plots of spikes and the IPSRs RX (t) (X = MC and BC) for the MCs and the BCs, respectively. As in the case of the GCs, sparsely synchronized spiking stripes appear successively in the rater plots of spikes and the corresponding IPSRs exhibit synchronous oscillations. As NMC is decreased, the interval between the neighboring spiking stripes becomes narrower, and hence the population frequency fp(X) of the SSR becomes increased.
With decreasing NMC from 80, the firing activities of both the MCs and the BCs become weakened. Hence, unlike the case of the GCs, spikes in the raster plot become more and more sparse, which leads to decrease in the occupation degree Oi (denoting the fraction of spiking neurons in each spiking stripe). Moreover, the spiking stripes become more and more smeared, and hence the pacing degree Pi (representing the degree of phase coherence between spikes) also becomes decreased, as in the case of the GCs.
The overall synchronization degree of the SSRs may be characterized in terms of the thermodynamic amplitude measure Ma, given by the time-averaged amplitude Ai of the IPSR RX (t); Ai is given by the difference between the maximum and the minimum of RX (t) divided by 2. Unlike the case of the GCs, with decreasing NMC, the

maximum RG(i)C,max(t) is found to show a decreasing tendency, mainly due to the effect of the decreased Oi. Due to decrease in Pi, RG(i)C,max(t) becomes more decreased. The minimum RG(i)C,min(t) is also found to decrease due to decrease in Oi. However, because of decrease in Pi, RG(i)C,min(t) becomes less decreased. As a result, as NMC is decreased, the amplitude measure Ma becomes decreased, as in the case of the GCs. Thus, the synchro-
nization degrees of all the SSRs for the GCs, the MCs,
and the BCs decrease with decreasing NMC.
Moreover, by decreasing FMC from 1 to 0, we make more quantitative characterization of the population fir-
ing behavior for various values of FMC; for the MCs, instead of NMC = 0, we consider the case of NMC = 2 (i.e., FMC = 0.025) which corresponds to the simplest coupled case. All relevant quantities are obtained by following
all the spiking stripes appearing during the stimulus period Ts (= 3 · 104 msec). Figure 5(e) shows the plot of the population frequency fp(X) [X = MC (open circle) and BC (cross)] versus FMC. Through interaction with the GCs in the GC-MC and the GC-BC loops, the population frequencies fp(X) of the SSRs for the MCs and the BCs are found to increase from 13 to 21.1 Hz in the
same way as that for the GCs in Fig. 4(c). Thus, the
GCs, the MCs, and the BCs exhibit SSRs with the same
beta-range population frequency fp which increases with decreasing FMC.
The synchronization degree of the SSR for the MCs
and the BCs may be characterized in terms of the ther-
modynamic amplitude measure Ma and the statisticalmechanical spiking measure Ms. Figures 5(f1)-5(f4) show the plots of the amplitude measure Ma, the average occupation degree Oi , the average pacing degree Pi , and the statistical-mechanical spiking measure Ms versus FMC, respectively; MC (open circle) and BC (cross). As FMC is decreased from 1 to 0, the thermodynamic amplitude measure Ma [denoting the time-averaged amplitude of RX (t) (X = MC and BC)] for the MCs (BCs) is found to decrease rapidly from 99.1 (112.8) to 18.6
(0.98), as in the case of the GCs.
Unlike the case of the GCs, due to decreased firing
activity of the MCs (BCs) with decreasing FMC from 1 to 0, the average occupation degree Oi of the spikes becomes decreased from 0.86 (0.92) to 0.25 (0.09); more
sparse spikes appear in the raster plot. Similarly, with
decreasing FMC, the average pacing degree Pi between the sparse spikes is also found to decrease from 0.73 (0.77)
to 0.26 (0.21) for the MCs (BCs). Then, the statistical-
mechanical spiking measure Ms for the MCs (BCs), given by the product of the occupation and the pacing degrees,
is found to decrease from 0.63 (0.71) to 0.065 (0.019),
which is in consistent with the decrease in Ma. In this way, as FMC is decreased, the synchronization degrees of the SSRs for the GCs, the MCs, and the BCs become
decreased together.
In addition to the population behaviors, we also study
the individual firing behaviors in the SSRs of the MCs

12
and the BCs. Figures 5(b1)-5(b2) and Figs. 5(d1)-5(d3) show the ISI histograms for the MCs and the BCs, respectively. Unlike the GCs, both the MCs and the BCs exhibit intrastripe burstings as well as interstripe intermittent spikings, locked to the IPSR RX (t) (X = MC and BC) at random multiples of the global period TG(X) of RX (t). As a result, the ISI histograms for the MCs and the BCs consist of both the intrastripe bursting peak and the interstripe skipping peaks.
We note that, with decreasing NMC, the intrastripe bursting activity of the MCs and the BCs becomes weakened, and hence the height of the intrastripe bursting peak becomes decreased, which results in development of the interstripe skipping peaks; e.g., more and more higher-order skipping peaks appear, in comparison to the case of NMC = 80 in Fig. 3. Particularly, in the case of the BCs, when passing NMC = 9 (i.e., FMC = 0.1125), intrastripe bursting peak is found to disappear; for the MCs intrastripe bursting peak persists until NMC = 1. Thus, only the interstripe skipping peaks appear for NMC = 0 in Fig. 5(d3). In this way, with decreasing NMC the interstripe skipping peaks become more and more developed; particularly, more development occurs for the BCs than the MCs. Hence, the mean ISIs ( ISI ) become increased for the MCs and the BCs, which results in decrease in the population-averaged MFRs fi(X) (X = MC and BC).
Thus, as FMC is decreased from 1 to 0.025 (0) for the MCs (BCs), fi(X) (X = MC and BC) is found to decrease from 42.1 (55.4) to 10.5 (1.3) Hz [see Fig. 5(g)], in contrast to the increase in fi(GC) for the GCs in Fig. 4(e). Unlike the case of the GCs, for large FMC with strong intrastripe burstings, the population-averaged MFRs fi(X) are higher than the population frequency fp. However, as FMC is decreased, the intrastripe bursting activity becomes decreased, and then the interstripe skipping activity becomes intensified. Then, for small FMC with strong interstripe skipping activity (i.e., intrastripe burstings is very weak), fi(X) becomes less than fp, as in the case of the GCs (without intrastripe burstings).
We also note that, as FMC is decreased, the interstripe skipping peaks become more and more smeared, which leads to decrease in the random phase-locking degree Ld [denoting the degree of random phase-locking to RX (t)]. With decreasing FMC from 1 to 0.025 (0) for the MCs (BCs), Ld is found to decrease from 0.936 (0.941) to 0.662 (0.613), as shown in Fig. 5(h), as in the case of the GCs. Thus, as FMC is decreased, the random phase-locking degrees for the GCs, the MCs, and the BCs become decreased together, as in the synchronization degrees of the SSRs.
Finally, we compare the firing behaviors between the MCs and the BCs. For large FMC, the BCs exhibit firing activity with higher MFR fi(BC) than the MCs, due to stronger intraburst bursting activity. However, as FMC is sufficiently decreased, the bursting activity of the BCs

becomes very weak due to weak excitation from the MCs. Then, fi(BC) begins to decrease so rapidly and it becomes lower than fi(MC) [see Fig. 5(g)]. Similarly, for large FMC with strong intrastripe bursting activity, the random phase-locking degree Ld for the BCs is also a little larger than that for the MCs, while for sufficiently
small FMC with so weak intrastripe bursting activity, Ld for the BCs decreases rapidly and it becomes less than
that for the MCs, as shown in Fig. 5(h). The population
firing behaviors for the MCs and the BCs are also sim-
ilarly as follows. For large FMC with strong intrastripe bursting burst activity, Ma, Oi , Pi , and Ms for the BCs are larger than those for the MCs, while for suffi-
ciently small FMC (with very weak intrastripe bursting activity), those for the MCs become larger than those for
the BCs [see Figs. 5(f1)-5(f4)].

D. Quantitative Relationship between The Sparsely Synchronized Rhythm and The Winner-Take-All Competition
The main encoding GCs was found to exhibit sparse activation via winner-take-all competition in each GC cluster; only strongly active GCs survive under the feedback inhibition of the BC [60]. Such sparsity was thought to improve the pattern separation in the DG. In Subsec. III A, SSR is found to appear in the population of the GCs, along with occurrence of the winner-take-all competition. We investigate the quantitative association between the SSR and the winner-take-all competition.
We first consider the association between the measures characterizing the SSR of the GCs. Figure 6(a) shows the plot of the thermodynamic amplitude measure Ma ver-

sus the statistical-mechanical spiking measure Ms; plots

of Ma and Ms versus FMC are shown in Figs. 4(d1) and

4(d4), respectively. The thermodynamic and statistical-

mechanical synchronization degrees, Ma and Ms, (characterizing the population firing behavior in the SSR) are

strongly correlated with the Pearson's correlation coeffi-

cient r = 0.9957 [85].

Individual firing behaviors of the GCs are character-

ized in terms of the ISIs. Due to the random spike skip-

ping, the ISI histogram consists of the interstripe skip-

ping peaks. The random phase-locking degree Ld is used

to characterize the degree of random spike skipping (i.e.,

degree of sharpness of the interstripe skipping peaks in

the ISI histogram). Figure 6(b) shows the plot of Ld versus the average pacing degree Pi ; plots of Ld and Pi versus FMC are shown in Figs. 4(f) and 4(d3), respectively. Ld is found to be strongly correlated with Pi (characterizing the smearing degree of the spiking

stripes in the raster plot of spikes) with the Pearson's

correlation coefficient r = 0.9983.

We now consider the winner-take-all competition oc-

curring in each GC cluster via competition between the

firing activity of the GCs and the feedback inhibition of

the BC; for details refer to [60]. The firing activity of the

GCs is determined through competition between the ex-

ternal excitatory (E) to inhibitory (I) inputs to the GCs;

two types of E inputs from the EC cells and the MCs and

one kind of I input from the HIPP cells. The E-I conductance ratio R(Ec-onI) (given by the time-average of the external E to I conductances) was found to represent well

the degree of the external E-I input competition. GCs with larger R(Ec-onI) than a threshold survived in response to the feedback of the BC (i.e., they became winners). It

wthaesirtRhu(Esc-onsIh)owliens

that GCs become within the winner

active winners when threshold percentage

Wth% of the maximum R(Ec-onI)(max) of the GC with the

strongest activity; see Eq. (23) for Wth% in [60]. As

FMC is decreased from 1 to 0, Wth% was found to increase from 15.1 % to 55 % (see Fig. 10(f2) in [60]). Due

to the increased Wth%, more active GCs appear with decreasing FMC, and hence the winner-take-all competition becomes weaker.

Here, we introduce the winner-take-all competition

degree Wd which is reciprocally related to the winner threshold percentage Wth%:

(26)

The smaller Wth% is, the larger Wd is. Figure 6(c) shows the plot of Wd versus FMC. With decreasing FMC, Wd is decreased, and hence the winner-take-all competition
becomes weaker.
Figures 6(d) and 6(e) show plots of Ma and Ld versus Wd, respectively. Population (Ma) and individual (Ld) firing behaviors in the SSR are found to be positively cor-
related with the winner-take-all competition (Wd) with the Pearson's correlation coefficients r = 0.9709 and

14

0.9599, respectively. Hence, the synchronization and the random phase-locking degrees in the SSR of the GCs become higher when the winner-take-all competition is stronger.
IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
We investigated population and individual behaviors in the SSRs in a spiking neural network of the hippocampal DG. Through interaction of excitation of the GCs with inhibition of the BCs, SSRs have been found to appear in each population of the GCs and the BCs, along with occurrence of the winner-take-all competition in each GC cluster, leading to sparse activation of the GCs. Such sparsity has been known to be directly associated with pattern separation, facilitating pattern storage and retrieval in the area CA3.
In each case of the GCs and the BCs, sparsely synchronized stripes have been found to appear successively in the raster plots of spikes, and the corresponding IPSR RX (t) (X = GC and BC) exhibited oscillatory behavior with the population frequency fp (= 13 Hz). Such SSR has also been found to appear in the population of the hilar MCs (controlling the firing activity of the GC-BC loop) via interaction with the GCs in the GC-MC loop. Thus, SSRs of the GCs, the MCs, and the BCs emerged in the whole DG network. Similar sparsely-synchronized population rhythms were observed in the hippocampus, the neocortex, the cerebellum, and the olfactory system [45­48].
We have made intensive characterization of the population behaviors in the SSRs of the GCs, the MCs, and the BCs by employing the following diverse synchronization measures introduced in our prior works. As a thermodynamic synchronization degree, we used the amplitude measure Ma, given by the time-averaged amplitude of the macroscopic IPSR RX (t) (X = GC, MC, and BC) [49], and characterized the overall synchronization degree of the SSRs. The SSR of the GCs was found to have the lowest amplitude measure (Ma = 3.57, 99.12, and 112.75 for the GCs, MCs, and BCs, respectively). Next, we also made characterization of the population behaviors in terms of the statistical-mechanical spiking measure Ms (based on the microscopic spikes in the raster plot), given by the product of the occupation degree Oi and the pacing degree Pi [50]. Among the 3 SSRs, the SSR of the GCs was the most sparse, because its occupation degree Oi (= 0.14) was so much less than those in the SSRs of the MCs and the BCs; Oi = 0.86 and 0.92 for the MCs and the BCs, respectively. Also, its pacing degree Pi between the spikes in the raster plot was lower than those for the MCs and the BCs; Pi = 0.45, 0.73, and 0.77, respectively. Consequently, the statistical-mechanical spiking measure Ms of the SSR for the main encoding GCs became the lowest (Ms = 0.063, 0.63, and 0.71 for the GCs, MCs and the BCs, respectively), mainly due to sparse firing of the GCs (resulting

from the winner-take-all competition). In addition to the population behaviors, we have also
investigated individual firing activities in the SSRs of the GCs, MCs, and GCs. In the case of GCs, active GCs exhibited intermittent spikings, phase-locked to the IPSR RGC(t) at random multiples of its global period TG (= 76.9 msec). Due to the random spike skipping, the ISI histogram has been found to consist of distinct multiple peaks (called the interstripe skipping peaks) at the integer multiples of TG, similar to the cases of previouslyfound "standard" sparse synchronization [51­55]. However, unlike the standard sparse synchronization where the 1st-order peak was the highest one, the middle 6thand 7th-order peaks were the highest ones. In this multipeaked ISI histogram, the mean ISI ( ISI ) was 500.01 msec. Then, the population-averaged MFR of the GCs fi(GC) (=1/ ISI ) was 2.0 Hz, which was much less than the population frequency fp, mainly due to random spike skipping.
Unlike the case of GCs, MCs and BCs have been found to exhibit bursting-like multi-spikings within the stripes. Consequently, the ISI histograms for the MCs and the BCs have been found to have the intrastripe bursting peak, in addition to the interstripe skipping multi-peaks, in contrast to the standard sparse synchronization with only the interstripe skipping multi-peaks [51­55]. Due to the dominance of the intrastripe bursting peak, the mean ISI ( ISI ) became shorter; ISI = 23.7 and 18.1 msec for the MCs and the BCs, respectively. Then, the population-averaged MFR for the MCs and the BCs were fi(GC) (=1/ ISI ) were 42.1 and 55.4 Hz, respectively, which were higher than the population frequency fp (= 13 Hz), due to the intrastripe burstings, which was in contrast to the case of the GCs where fi(GC) is less then fp.
We also introduced a new random phase-locking degree Ld and characterized the "sharpness" of the interstripe skipping peaks representing how well the intermittent spikes make phase-locking to RGC(t) at random multiples of its global period TG. The random phase-locking degree Ld, characterizing the degree of random spike skipping for the GCs, was a little lower than those of the MCs and the BCs; Ld = 0.911, 0.936, and 0.941 for the GCs, the MCs, and the BCs, respectively. The order in magnitude of Ld was the same as that in the synchronization degrees, Ma and Ms, for the SSRs.
MC loss may occur during epileptogenesis. With decreasing FMC (fraction of the MCs) from 1 to 0, we investigated the effect of the MCs on the population and individual firing behaviors in the SSRs of the GCs, MCs, BCs. As FMC was decreased, the interval between the spiking stripes in the raster plot became narrowed, and the spiking stripes became more and more smeared. Hence, the population frequency fp of the SSRs showed an increasing tendency and their synchronization degrees became decreased. In the ISI histogram for the GCs, the mean ISI ( ISI ) became shorter, mainly due to weakened inhibition from the BCs, and hence the population aver-

aged MFR fi(GC) increased. Moreover, the interstripe skipping peaks became more and more smeared, leading to decrease in the random phase-locking degree Ld.
In the case of the MCs and the BCs, with decreasing FMC, the heights of the intrastripe bursting peaks in their ISI histograms became decreased mainly due to decrease in the firing activity of the MCs, which resulted in intensifying the interstripe skipping peaks (i.e. more and more higher-order interstripe skipping peaks appeared). Consequently, the mean ISI ( ISI ) became longer, which led to decrease in the population-averaged MFR fi(X) (X = MC and BC), in contrast to the increase in fi(GC) for the GCs. Similar to the case of the GCs, the random phase-locking degree Ld decreased because the interstripe skipping peaks became more and more smeared.
We note that the SSR of the GCs appeared along with occurrence of the winner-take-all competition in the GC clusters. Hence, we became concerned about the quantitative correlation between the population and individual behaviors in the SSR and the winner-take-all competition for the GCs. It was thus found that both the synchronization degrees, Ma and Ms, and the random phase-locking degree Ld were positively correlated with the winner-take-all competition degree Wd.
Finally, we discuss limitations of our present work and future works. In the present work, the population and individual behaviors in the SSRs were found to be positively correlated with the winner-take-all competition. However, this kind of correlation does not imply causal relationship. Hence, in future work, it would be interesting to make intensive investigation on their dynamical causation. Also, in the present work, we studied only the case of ablating the MCs for investigation of their role. In future, it would also be interesting to study the population and the individual behaviors in

15
the SSRs by varying the synaptic strength KR(BC,MC) (R = NMDA and AMPA) of the synapse between the MC and the BC. The effect of decrease in KR(BC,MC) would be similar to that of decreasing FMC, because the synaptic inputs into the BC and the GCs are decreased in both cases.
Moreover, in the present work, we took into consideration the disynaptic inhibitory effect of the MCs on the GCs (i.e., disynaptic inhibition to the GCs mediated by the BC). However, in our present DG network, we did not consider the synaptic connection from the HIPP cells to the BCs, and hence we could not study the disynaptic effect of the HIPP cells on the GCs (i.e., HIPP  BC  GC). The HIPP cells are known to disinhibit the BC [56, 57], which results in decrease in the inhibitory effect of the BC on the GCs. Then, the activity of the GCs may increase. In this way, the disynaptic effect of the HIPP cells on the GCs, mediated by the BC, which tends to increase the activity of the GCs, is in contrast to the disynaptic inhibition of the MCs to the GCs (decreasing the firing activity of the GCs). Hence, in future work, it would be meaningful to investigate the disynaptic effect of the HIPP cells on the GC in a modified DG network (including the synaptic connections from the HIPP cells to the BCs).
