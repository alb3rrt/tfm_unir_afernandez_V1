## Abstract

This article addresses several longstanding misconceptions concerning Koopman operators, including the existence of lattices of eigenfunctions, common eigenfunctions between Koopman operators, and boundedness and compactness of Koopman operators, among others. Counterexamples are provided for each misconception. This manuscript also proves that the Gaussian RBF's native space only supports bounded Koopman operator corresponding to affine dynamics, which shows that the assumption of boundedness is very limiting. A framework for DMD is presented that requires only densely defined Koopman operators over reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and the effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through reconstruction examples.
