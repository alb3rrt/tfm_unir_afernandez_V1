We revisit the phenomenon of the resonant transmission of fermionic carriers through a quantum device connected to two contacts with different chemical potentials. We show that, besides the traditional in solid-state physics Landauer-Bu¨ttiker approach, this phenomenon can be also described by the non-Markovian master equation for the reduced density matrix of the fermions in the quantum device. We identify validity regions of both approaches in the system parameter space and argue that for large relaxation rates the accuracy of the latter approach greatly exceeds the accuracy of the former.

I. INTRODUCTION
The problem of electron transport in a metallic wire connecting two contacts is older than quantum mechanics [1]. In the past centuries this problem was readdressed several times reflecting the progress in experimental physics, where the main milestones are the appearance of clean semiconductors and lithography technology and the emergence of physics of ultra-cold atoms. The former technology substituted the wire with an engineered device ­ a quantum dot [2, 3], while with cold atoms in optical lattice one can mimic the behavior of crystalline electrons in the pure form, i.e., without complications caused by the presence of the longrange Coulomb interaction and electron-phonon interaction [4, 5]. These two systems ­ quantum dots and cold atoms ­ allow experimentalists to study the coherent transport of carriers (electrons and neutral atoms, respectively) where deviations from the classical Ohm law become especially pronounced.
As concerns the theory, presently we have a vast variety of methods which, however, can be sorted into two large groups. The methods belonging to the first group, which we shall refer to as the solid-state physics approach, are traced back to Landauer's conjecture [6] that the wire conductance is related to the transmission probability and, as a rule, they extensively use the Green function formalism. The famous result of the solid-state physics approach is the theoretical description of the phenomenon of resonant transmission in quantum dots [7, 8]. The methods belonging to the second group, which we shall refer to as the quantum optics approach, operate with very different notions like the quantum master equation for open (generally, many-body) quantum systems and the Born and Markov approximations [9­13]. One can also assign to this group the stochastic methods which explore the correspondence between the master equations and the stochastic Schr¨odinger equations [14­16]. Remarkably, in spite of the completely different technique the quantum optics approach is also capable to capture the phenomenon of the resonant transmission

[17]. The question arises of how the results of the above two approaches are related to each other and which of them is more accurate. In the present work we answer this question by studying the simple model for quantum transport of fermionic carriers introduced in Ref. [18]. This model can be viewed either as a generalisation of the open Hubbard models [19­21] onto the case of arbitrary reservoir temperature or as a generalisation of the Landauer approach for the electron transport [7, 8] where the relaxation processes in the contacts are explicitly taken into account. Thus, the model can be equally analysed by using both solid-state physics and quantum optics approaches.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we recall the ingredients of the model and preliminary discuss the system dynamical regimes depending on the control parameter. Analytical results are collected in Sec. III. This section consists of three subsections where we employ three different methods to study the system, namely, the Markovian master equation, non-Markovian master equation, and the Landauer-like approach. In Sec. IV we analyse the coherent properties of the carriers that help us to quantify the degree of validity of the used approaches. The main results of the work are summarised in the concluding Sec. V.
II. THE MODEL
We consider the set-up consisting of a linear tightbinding chain of the length L coupled at both ends with two tight-binding rings of M sites each, see Fig. 1 in Ref. [18]. Throughout the text the rings are termed the contacts since they served as the particle reservoirs. Noninteracting spinless fermions can hop between the sites of the chain and the sites of the rings with the rates Js and Jr, where Js  Jr, while the hopping between the chain and the contacts is quantified by the coupling constant   Js, Jr. The dynamics is governed by the master

This ensures that the Bloch states of isolated contacts are populated according to the Fermi-Dirac distribution with given chemical potential µ and inverse temperature . Finally, the constant  in Eq. (1) is the relaxation rate which determines how fast the isolated contacts relax to their thermodynamic equilibrium. It was shown in Ref. [18] that the considered model validates the main assumption of the Landauer approach about the reflectionless contacts, thus, allowing for the straightforward application of this theory.

Unlike Ref. [18] in the present work we shall consider short chain where one can observe the phenomenon of resonant transmission. Also we focus on the linear response regime where the current across the chain is proportional to the contact chemical potential difference. As an example, Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show the results of numerical analysis of the model for  = , L = 5 and M = 100, which is large enough to speak about quasi-continuous

spectrum of the contacts. In these numerical simulations we evolve the system in time till the density matrix R(t) reaches its stationary value from which we determine the stationary current j . In Fig. 1 we depict the stationary current as a color map where the phenomenon of the resonant transmission is seen as local peaks at the values of the chemical potential µ = -Jr cos(F ) coinciding with eigenenergies of the isolated tight-binding chain. Notice that the peaks are present only in certain interval of . Fig. 2 shows the current as the function of  for µ = 0 (the central peak in Fig. 1) and µ = 0.25 (the nearby valley). This figure is aimed to illustrate the Esaki-Tsu-like dependence [22­25] of the current on the relaxation rate , with the universal asymptotic j   for   0 and j  1/ for   . In Fig. 2 we also demark by the vertical dashed lines the different dynamical regimes of the system which we briefly discuss in the next paragraph.
In parameter region III the large value of the relaxation constant  validates the Born and Markov approximations that allow us to derive the Markovian master equation for the reduced density matrix of the carriers in the chain, see Sec. III C. In region II the Markov approximation fails, however, the Born approximation is still valid. In the other words, the ergodic properties of the contacts, when they are viewed as particle reservoirs, are not affected by the presence of the chain. The direct consequence of this fact is that the reduced density matrices of the contacts remain close to their thermodynamic equilibrium [26]. The failure of the Markov approximation leads to the non-Markovian (integrodifferential) master equation for the reduced density matrix of the carriers in the chain, see Sec. III B. Finally, if we move to region I we break both the Markov and Born approximations. To analyse the system in this region we employ the solidstate physics approach. It is shown in Sec. III A that this approach gives quantitatively correct results in region I and qualitatively correct results in region II. However, it fails to reproduce the case of large  where it gives the wrong asymptotic j  1/2.

This set of equations can be easily generalised onto the
case of two contacts where the second contact is attached to last site of the chain. When treating the latter case
we shall change notation for the contact SPDM from ^r to ^, where  takes the value  = 1 for the left contact and  = L for the right contact.

III. QUANTUM TRANSPORT ACROSS THE TIGHT-BINDING CHAIN

A. The limit of small 

Eq. (1) contains only pairwise combinations of the creation and annihilation operators. This allows us to rewrite it in terms of the single particle density matrix (SPDM) ^. Let us assume for a moment that only one (the left) contact is attached to the chain. Then the total SPDM takes the following block form,

^ =

^r ^c ^c ^s

,

(9)

where ^r is the SPDM of the contact with the elements k,k = Tr(^bk^bk R^), ^s is the SPDM of the chain with the elements , = Tr(c^c^R^), and ^c has the elements k, = Tr(^bkc^R^). It can be shown from Eq. (1) that

Let us approximate Eqs. (10-12) by the single equation of the form

(18)

This approximation is valid in the limit   0 for the asymptotically large time where the matrix ^ is close to its stationary value. Notice that the limit   0 implies

that the system (18) relaxes to its stationary value as the whole and, hence, there is no way to obtain the equation for ^s in the closed-form.
The introduced Eq. (17) can be solved analytically by using the eigenstates |n ,

H|n = En|n ,

(19)

of the total Hamiltonian (18). In particular, the stationary total density matrix is given by the equation [25]

In Fig. 3 we compare the stationary current calculated on the basis of the original master equation with that obtained on the basis of Eq. (21). A good agreement for small   0.02 is noticed.
Eq. (21) also provides a simple explanation for the observed resonant structure of the current. In fact, this structure is already reproduced if we keep in Eq. (21) only one term with p = 1. (The term with p = 0 vanishes due to the wave function symmetry.) Thus, the

transmission peaks are due to the property of the current matrix elements which we shall characterise by the function

j(E) = (E - En) n|^j|n+1 .

By definition, the function (23) is close to the local density of state,

LDS = (E - En) n|n ,

(24)

which lies behind the concept of the level broadening in the solid-state physics approach and which is directly related to the transmission probability |t(E)|2. For the parameters of Fig. 3 the function j(E) and the local density of states are plotted in Fig. 4. In principle, by using the Green function one can extend the analysis of Eq. (21) further [7], however, this goes beyond our aim which is to identify the validity regions of the different approaches. It is seen in Fig. 3 (see also the dashed lines in Fig. 2) that the approach based on the scattering theory underestimate the current for large .

B. Non-Markovian master equation

In this subsection we discuss the quantum optics approach based on the non-Markovian master equation for the carriers in the chain. We shortly come back to Eqs. (10-12) which refer to the case of the single contact. From Eq. (11) we find the formal solution with the initial condition ^c(0) = 0

In the case of two contacts the above procedure results in the equation

(30)

=1,L

where the operator LL has the similar to Eq. (28) form with the projection operator |1 1| substituted by |L L| and generally different value of the chemical potential in Eq. (29). Equation (30) together with Eq. (28) constitute the non-Markovian master equation for the fermionic transport [27]. Notice the key role of  in Eq. (28) ­ since the Bessel function at large t decays as 1/ t the integral in Eq. (28) is only convergent with non-zero .
To check the obtained non-Markovian master equation we solve it numerically and compare the result with that obtained on the basis of the original master equation where we do not take the limit M   and do not a priori assume the validity of the Born approximation. It is seen in Fig. 3 that the non-Markovian master equation well reproduces the resonant structure for the stationary current with nice quantitive agreement in regions II and III.
The obtained master equation can be elaborated further if µ  µ and one considers the low-temperature limit   . The former condition justifies the ansatz

^s = ^(s0) + µ^(s1).

(31)

where ^(s0) is the equilibrium density matrix for µ = 0 which does not support the directed current. The latter condition justifies the relation

lim n(E, µ + µ) = (µ - E) + µ(E - µ), (32)

where  is the Heaviside function. Using these approximations one finds from Eq. (30)

Finally, from Eq. (33) we obtain the algebraic equation for the stationary ^(s1). In the chain eigenbasis |n ,

,

(39)

and C1 and CL are determined by the eigenmodes of the isolated chain,

Cn,m = n| |m ,  = 1, L .

(40)

It follows from Eq. (37) that the matrix ^(s1) (which is proportional to r.h.s. of the equation) crucially depends on the value of the chemical potential due to the resonancelike dependence of the matrix A on the chemical potential µ.
The advantage of the discussed algebraic approach (as well as the algebraic approach in Sec. III A) is that it allows us to predict the stationary current without simulating the system dynamics, which reduces the computational time by orders of magnitude. For large  the predictions based on Eq. (37) are plotted in Fig. 2 by the dash-dotted lines. Taken into account that Eq. (37) involves even more approximations than the non-Markovian master equation (30), the agreement with results of the straightforward numerical simulation of the system dynamics is quite satisfactory.

C. Markovian master equation
The Markov approximation assumes that one can neglect the memory effects. It is justified if ^s(t) is a slowly

varying matrix in the time scale 1/. Then, by using the general relation for the slowly varying function,

(42)

where we take into account that J (0) = 1 while JF(0) equals to the mean occupation number n¯ of the ring sites according to Eq. (29). Substituting Eq. (42) into
Eq. (30) we obtain

It follows from Eq. (43) that the characteristic time scale for ^s(t) is determined by the inverse effective relaxation constant 1/~. Thus, the Markov approximation requires   .
The obtained Markovian master equation Eq. (43) coincides with the equation for SPDM of the open FermiHubbard model, which in the case of spinless Fermions reads

Since Eq. (48) involves only the mean density of carriers in the contacts it approximates the exact results only in the limit    where the stationary current does not show any resonant structure.

FIG. 5: Eigenvalues of stationary matrix ^(s1) as the function of F . The system parameters are the same as in Fig. 3.

IV. COHERENCE OF THE TRANSPORTING STATES
In the end of Sec. III A we introduce the density matrix ^(s1) which characterises the stationary current across the chain in the liner response regime (i.e., determines the conductance). In what follows we shall term this matrix as the transporting state. It is interesting to address the question of how close is the transporting state to a pure state. In Fig. 5 we plotted eigenvalues of ^(s1) for four different values of the relaxation constant  which we used earlier in Fig. 3. By comparing Fig. 5 and Fig. 3 we conclude that the transporting state is close to a pure state (which has to have the single non-zero eigenvalue) only in the interval of  where the stationary current shows the resonant structure. Moreover, even for these  coherence of the transporting state depends on the value of the chemical potential µ. Namely, the state is more coherent for µ corresponding to the transmission peaks and essentially less coherent for µ corresponding to the transmission deeps. This result stresses the main difference of the discussed master equation approach with the Landauer-like approaches which implicitly assumes that the transport state of the fermionic carriers in the chain is the pure state given by the Bloch wave with the Fermi quasimomentum.

V. CONCLUSION
We revisite the problem of the quantum transport of fermionic particles across the tight-binding chain connected to two contacts. The analysis is performed by using the simple model introduced in our earlier work [18] where the contacts are modelled by the tight-binding rings of arbitrary size. The coupling between the chain

7

and contacts is controlled by the parameter  and the contacts are characterized by their chemical potentials µ and the temperature 1/. The mathematical framework of the model is the master equation for the total density matrix of the composed system chain plus contacts which involves the important physical parameter  ­ the rate at which the isolated contacts relax to the thermodynamic equilibrium. Although in reality the rate  correlates with the contact temperature (indeed, it looks unfeasible to have low rates at high temperatures and visa versa), in the work we consider  and  as independent parameters.
We calculate the current in the chain by using the three different approaches ­ the Markovian and non-Markovian master equations for the reduced density matrix of the carriers in the chain, and by the Landauer-like approach for the quantum transport. We discuss in detail each of

the listed approaches and identify the regions of their validity. In particular, it is found that the non-Markovian master equation approach (which is a representative of quantum optics approaches) and the Landauer approach (which is representative of the solid-state physics approaches) do reproduce the resonant structure of the stationary current. However, the former approach overestimates it in the region of small , while the latter approach underestimates the current in the region of large . For moderate , where oscillations of the stationary current j = j(µ) have maximal amplitude, both the solid-state physics and quantum optics approaches give essentially the same result.

[26] We mention that this statement does not imply the absence of entanglement between the system (the chain) and reservoirs (the contacts). On the contrary, the entanglement is always there and it is responsible for the decoherence effect of reservoirs [11]. [27] Eq. (30) also describes the transport of non-interacting Bose particles if one uses the Bose-Einstein distribution instead of the Fermi-Dirac distribution Eq. (8). [28] A.R. Kolovsky, and D.N.
