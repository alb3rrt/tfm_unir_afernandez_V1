We argue that the global causal structure of the singularity is not a purely geometric property but also depends on the collapsing matter-field leading to its formation. To show this, we investigate the global visibility of the end state of a spherically symmetric marginally bound Lemaitre-TolmanBondi collapsing cloud (which is well studied in general relativity) in the framework of modified gravity having the generalized Lagrangian R + R2 in the Einstein-Hilbert action. Here R is the Ricci scalar, and  > 0 is a constant. As an example, we depict that for the same LTB metric governing the spacetime formed due to two different matter-fields, i.e., dust in general relativity and imperfect viscous fluid in f (R) gravity, the singularity is locally visible in the former case, and globally visible in the latter case.

I. INTRODUCTION
A massive object contracting under the influence of its gravity can cause a singularity to form if its mass is beyond a certain limit [1]. This singularity, according to the weak cosmic censorship hypothesis (CCH) [2], is hidden behind a null surface called the event horizon. However, lately, it has been shown that, in the case of a collapsing spherically symmetric dust cloud in the framework of General Relativity (GR), sufficient radial inhomogeneity in the density can allow the null geodesics to escape the singularity and reach an observer far away, thereby making the singularity visible [3­6]. A singularity, if visible, can be classified into two types: local and global. In the case of locally visible singularity, the null geodesic can escape the singularity, but before crossing the boundary of the collapsing cloud, it comes across the trapped surfaces formed around the singularity and falls back in [7­9]. Since the observer must be inside the collapsing cloud to receive signals from only locally visible singularity, such a case may not have much astrophysical relevance. In

the case of globally visible singularity, no such trapped surfaces come into the picture, and the outgoing singular null geodesics travels to future null infinity without any hindrance, and hence has more astrophysical relevance [10].
Coming to the theory of gravity, GR is a very successful theory and has been supported by various observational evidence like the measurement of the deflection angle of the light bent due to the curvature in the spacetime; which is predicted by GR as twice that predicted by Newton's theory (and correspondingly the gravitational time delay), [11] the perihelion precession of the mercury, the gravitational redshift, etc [12]. However, GR may not give a complete picture of the working of the universe. It has been found that GR is not renormalizable and hence can not be quantized [13, 14]. It was shown by Stelle [15] that actions with higher-order curvature terms can be renormalized. However, it had its shortcoming of unresolved unitarity problem. In the strong gravity regime, higher-order curvature terms in action, if present, will dominate, and hence it may become essential to incorporate the modified action while investigating the neighborhood of the singularity formed due to gravitational collapse.
One such example of higher-order gravity theory is the Starobinsky type gravity [16], which was used to study curvature-driven inflationary scenarios. This model has the Lagrangian expressed as R + R2, where R is the Ricci scalar, and  > 0 is a constant [17]. In the strong

2

gravity regime, the second-order curvature term R2 can dominate and play a significant role. Whether higherorder terms (or any change in the Lagrangian) has any effect on the causal property of the singularity is our concern which we address in this article.
The article is organized as follows: In Section II, we give a brief overview of the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) spacetime metric [18­20] and the consequent collapse formalism, including the visibility property of the central singularity. This metric governs the inhomogeneous collapsing dust cloud in GR. In Section III, we discuss a class of gravity theory called the f (R) gravity model [21, 22], specifically the one with the Lagrangian having second-order curvature term. We ensure that the matter field governed by the LTB metric satisfies the strong, weak, null, and dominant energy conditions. The first central singularity is then investigated for its causal property. Comparisons are made between the visibility of the singularity formed due to two different matter fields, i.e., dust, and viscous fluid with heat flow, respectively in GR and in f (R) ), both governed by the same LTB metric. Finally, we end the article with the results and the conclusions drawn thereafter, in Section IV. Hereafter, we use the units wherein c = 8G = 1.

II. LTB GEOMETRY IN GENERAL RELATIVITY AND THE COLLAPSE
FORMALISM

In general relativity, the collapse of a spherically symmetric dust cloud is governed by the Laimetre-TolmanBondi metric as follows:

ds2 = -dt2 + A 2 dr2 + A2d2,

(1)

1+b

in the comoving coordinate t and r. Here, A(t, r) is the physical radius of the collapsing cloud and is a monotone decreasing function of t, i.e., A < 0, b(r) is called the velocity function and incorporates the information about the initial velocity of the collapsing cloud. The superscripts prime and dot denote the partial derivative with respect to radial and time coordinate, respectively. The energy-momentum tensor for dust is expressed as

T µ = U µU  .

(2)

Here U µ, U  are the components of the four velocity. Using the Einsteins' field equation, one can get the expression of the density as

S

 = A2A ,

(3)

where

S = A A 2 - b .

(4)

S is called the Misner-Sharp mass function [23]. S/2 gives the mass of the cloud inside the shell of radial coordinate

r at time t. Since the pressure inside the cloud is zero, the second Einsteins equation gives us

S

- A2A = 0,

(5)

from which we can conclude that S is independent of t, i.e the mass inside the shell of comoving radius r is conserved. Due to the available degree of freedom, hereafter, we will consider the case for which b = 0. This corresponds to a marginally bound collapse. The mathematical difficulties by taking such case are drastically reduced, although the case of non-marginally bound collapse (b = 0) can give results which are not very different qualitatively [5]. On integrating Eq.(4), we obtain

ts(r)

(6)

Here ts(r) is the constant of integration, and is called the singularity curve. It tells us the time at which the shell of radial coordinate r collapses to a singularity. Rescaling the physical radius using the coordinate freedom such that initially A(0, r) = r, one express the singularity curve as

2

ts(r)

(7)

The causal structure of the singularity depends on the evolution of the apparent horizon. This horizon is the boundary of all the trapped surfaces. The expansion scalar for the outgoing null geodesic congruence, given by [24]

l = hµ µl =

gµ

+

lµn + l nµ -ln

µl

(8)

vanishes on this surface. On the trapped surface, this expansion scalar is negative. hµ in the above equation is a spatial metric on the cross-section of the congruence, called the transverse metric; and n and l are the tangents of the incoming and outgoing null geodesics, respectively. It can be found from Eq.(8) that on the apparent horizon, the Misner-Sharp mass function equals the physical radius of the collapsing cloud, i.e.

S(r) = A(t, r).

(9)

Using this, we can obtain the evolution of the apparent horizon, represented by the apparent horizon curve as

(10)

for the marginally bound collapse. We can see that for r = 0, the time of formation of the singularity and that of the apparent horizon is the same, keeping in mind the regularity of the initial data, i.e., S(0) = 0. If the time of formation of the apparent horizon increases for increasing r, the outgoing singular null geodesics can escape.

3

Depending on whether or not these geodesics later get trapped by trapped surfaces, one can obtain a locally or globally visible singularity, respectively. As mentioned in the Introduction, trapping of the outgoing singular null geodesic depends on the evolution of the event horizon, which is a null surface. The evolution of the event horizon is the same as the evolution of an infinitely redshifted null geodesic escaping the center (singular or non-singular center). Additionally, at the boundary of the collapsing cloud, the event horizon and the apparent horizon are indistinguishable. The dynamics of the EH is thus the solution of the null geodesic differential equation

satisfying the condition

(12)

which is obtained from Eq.(10). The necessary condition for the singularity to be globally visible is that at r = 0, tEH = ts.
If the event horizon at the center forms before the formation of the singularity, then, even if there exists an outgoing singular null geodesic with a positive tangent at r = 0, it will later get trapped by the trapped surfaces and fall back to the singularity, thereby making the singularity visible only locally. It should be noted that the event horizon at r = 0 can not form after the formation of the singularity at r = 0. This is because no null geodesic wavefront starting from r = 0 can evolve further if formed after ts(0) because of the existence of trapped surface already present surrounding the center, as seen from Eq.(10). It has been shown before that there exists a non-zero measured set of initial data, S and b, in the LTB case, leading to a globally visible singularity.
In the Starobinsky type gravity, i.e., the one where we use the generalized lagrangian f (R) = R + R2 in the Einstein-Hilbert action, we can show that the LTB metric is a solution, i.e., the matter field governed by such metric satisfies all the energy conditions. Unlike in GR, the LTB metric does not hold any special importance in this modified theory of gravity. However, for the sake of proving that the causal structure of the singularity is not a purely geometric property, we consider the same LTB metric in the f (R) gravity to highlight the difference in the visibility of the singularity formed in this case from that in GR, in the next section.

III. GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE IN f (R) GRAVITY

The total action for f (R) gravity is written as [22]

1 S=
2

f (R)-gd4x + Sm,

(13)

where Sm is the matter lagrangian. Using variational principle with respect to the metric gives the following field equation:

1 Gµ = F (R)

. Here = gijij. In f (R) theories of gravity, from the above field equation, even in the absence of matter field, the Einstein tensor can be non-zero, unlike in GR. One can interpret that Tµ(D ) be considered as the energymomentum tensor, which has a purely geometric origin. However, it is not under obligation to obey the strong energy conditions.

A. Collapsing matter field and the energy conditions

For the theory of gravity where the generalized Lagrangian in the Einstein-Hilbert action is f (R) = R + R2, the collapsing cloud governed by the LTB metric, as shown in Eq.(1) is a viscous fluid with heat flow, unlike in GR, as seen in the equation:

T µ = U µU  + phµ + 2q(µnµ) -  Here,

nµn - 1 hµ . 3 (16)

· hµ is the transverse metric, expressed as

hµ = UµU + gµ ,

(17)

· nµ is a spatial unit vector in the radial direction satisfying

nµnµ = 1 and nµU µ = 0.

(18)

· qµ is the heat flux vector and is spacelike, i.e.

qµU µ = 0.

(19)

It describes the heat conduction such that qµnµ is the heat, crossing a unit surface which is perpendicular to nµ, per unit time.

· p is the effective pressure given by

p = pr + 2pt ,

(20)

3

where pr and pt are the radial and tangential components of the pressure inside the collapsing cloud.

The function S in the Eq.(22-23), in terms of metric components is expressed as in Eq.(4) with b = 0. However, it is necessary to note that unlike in GR, S no more physically signifies the mass inside a collapsing shell of radial coordinate r at time t. It can now be considered just an arbitrary function of the metric components.
The collapsing matter field should satisfy all the energy conditions throughout the collapse, for which the following inequalities should be satisfied [25]:

(32)

where  = ( + pr)2 - 4q2. In Fig.(I), we have depicted the satisfaction of all the above inequalities, for the matter field having density, pressures, and heat flux as in Eq.(22- 25), and for certain fixed parametric values, as mentioned in the caption. It should be noted that the energy conditions are also satisfied for all nearby parametric values. Hence, there exists a non-zero measured set of parameters in the density profile and a non-zero range of  such that the energy conditions will not be violated for a small perturbation in these parametric values.

B. Matching condition

spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat vacuum spacetime, which is the Schwarzschild spacetime. However, in the framework of f (R) gravity, for smooth matching of the spacetimes of these two regions, apart from the above-mentioned two junction conditions, the continuity of the Ricci scalar and its radial derivative at the boundary is also required. It was shown by Nzioki et. al [28] that for a class of f (R) gravity model, which includes the Starobinsky one, the Schwarzchild solution is the only static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat vacuum spacetime with vanishing Ricci scalar, thereby extending the Birkhoff's theorem in f (R) gravity.
Goswami et. al. [29] in 2014 showed that smooth matching of the Ricci scalar and its radial derivative constrains the previously free function S(r), thereby finetuning it and making it unstable under matter perturbation. The argument goes as follows: The Ricci scalar is expressed in terms the arbitrary function S as

3M + rM

R = - v2 (rv

, + v)

(33)

where

M

is

related

to

S

as

M

=

S r3

,

and

v

=

v(t, r)

=

A r

is called the scaling function. The scaling function can

be thought of as the redefined time coordinate such that

at the initiation of the collapse, v(0, r) = 1 for all the

shells, and v(t, r) = 0 when the shell of comoving radius

r collapses to a singularity. Now, in order for the smooth

matching of the Ricci scalar and its radial derivative at

the junction connecting two regions V- (LTB spacetime),

and V- (Schwarszchild spacetime), R and R for the inte-

rior spacetime should vanish at the boundary rc. Hence

R should have the form

R = (rc - r)2g(t, r).

(34)

Equating Eq.(33) and Eq.(34), we obtain

rM + 3M = j(r)(rc - r)2,

(35)

where

j(r) = v2(rv + v)g(t, r).

(36)

The functional form of v and g(t, r) is determined once the functional form of M is determined. Hence we can say that j = j(M, r). The Eq.(35) then becomes a firstorder ordinary linear differential equation, which can only be satisfied by a class of functions M . This is how the additional matching condition constrains the function S in R + R2 gravity, which was free to choose in GR.

For smooth matching of the spacetime governing the region of the collapsing cloud (V-) with that of the exterior surrounding spacetime (V+), the first and second fundamental form induced by these two regions on the hypersurface  which partitions these two regions should match [26, 27]. It can be shown that in GR, the interior LTB spacetime can be matched with the exterior static,

C. Globally visible nodal singularity in f (R) gravity.
The collapse formalism of the LTB metric in GR discussed in the previous section, i.e. Eq.(4) and Eq.(6-12), is same for the collapsing matter field governed by identical LTB metric, in f (R) gravity for a time-independent

8

function S and vanishing b. However, the boundary rc of the collapsing cloud, which we define as the comoving radius where  vanishes, will be different in f (R) gravity. This is because the density profile Eq.(22) is different from Eq.(3). This causes a change in the evolution of the event horizon, thereby affecting the global causal structure of the singularity. The difference can be clearly seen in Fig.(II). In this figure, the geometry governing the collapse of two different matter fields in two different theories of gravity is the same. By this, we mean that apart from both matter fields being governed by the LTB metric, the initial data (S, b) is also the same in both cases. However, since the boundaries of these two collapsing clouds are different, the initial condition Eq.(12), which needs to be satisfied by the solution of the differential Eq.(11) for it to represent the dynamics of the event horizon, is changed. Hence the previously locally visible singularity in GR is now globally visible in f (R) gravity. The evolution of the density of the matter field along with the trapped (in GR) and escaped (in f (R)) null geodesics are depicted in Fig.(III) and Fig.(IV), respectively. For a fixed functional form of S as mentioned in the captions, for  = 10-6, one gets a globally visible singularity. However, this is not the only value. One can show that for any greater value of , globally visible singularity is achieved. This means that one can trace infinite event horizons, each corresponding to one value of , which are solutions of the differential equation (11) and starting from (ts(0), 0) in the (t, r) plane. This is only possible if (ts(0), 0) is a nodal point.
In order to check if the first singularity is a nodal point, consider two different frameworks of gravity, both of which are Starobinsky type, but with different value of scalar multiples non-minimally coupled with the quadratic curvature term in the Lagrangian. Let us call them 1 and 2, with

2 > 1

(37)

(1 can also be zero, which corresponds to GR). The evolution of the two distinct event horizons, each corresponding to distinct values of , are dictated by differential Eq.(12) respectively satisfying

3

2 tEH (r1) = 3

r12 S(r1)

-

2 3 S(r1),

(38)

and

3

2 tEH (r2) = 3

r22 S(r2)

-

2 3 S(r2).

(39)

Here r1 and r2 are the largest comoving radius of the collapsing cloud corresponding to 1 and 2 respectively. Let us choose 1 such that for a given fixed functional form of S, the first singularity is globally visible. One
can therefore see that for  = 1 at (ts(0), 0) in the (t, r) plane,

dtEH (r) dr

is not continuous. This is because for a small change in tEH from ts(0) to some tf where

tf > ts(0),

there is zero change in r, since all null geodesics at r = 0

are trapped after the time ts(0).

Hence,

dtEH dr

is infinite

at r = 0.

Now, the uniqueness theorem of the first order lin-

ear

differential

equation

says

that

if

g(x, y)

and

g(x,y) y

are continuous in the neighborhood around x = 0, then

the solution (in a possibly smaller neighborhood around

x = 0) of the differential equation (with initial condition)

given by

y = g(x, y),

y(x0) = y0

is unique. However, this uniqueness theorem is not

applicable in our case because of the discontinuity of

A (t, r)(=

dtEH dr

)

at

(ts(0), 0).

Therefore, one can have

more than one solution of the differential Eq.(11), and

passing through (ts(0), 0), making it a nodal point.

Let us now fix the framework of gravity. For the singu-

larity to be visible by an asymptotic observer for infinite

time, the central singularity should emit a congruence

of infinite null geodesics, each redshifted by a different

amount and the event horizon being the most redshifted

(infinitely) null geodesic. This can happen because we

have shown that (ts(0), 0) is a nodal point.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
The concluding remarks are as follows:
1. In order to determine the global causal property of the singularity formed due to a collapsing spherically symmetric matter cloud, only knowing the spacetime metric governing the collapsing matter field is not sufficient. One also has to have the information of the largest comoving radius rc, which is also the initial size of the collapsing cloud. This boundary of the cloud affects the evolution of the event horizon in that it provides an initial condition to the differential equation whose solution satisfying this initial condition represents the dynamics of the event horizon.
2. To show this, we considered the same spacetime metric (marginally bound LTB using up the remaining one-degree freedom by fixing the functional form of S) governing two different matter fields respectively collapsing unhindered in two different theories of gravity. The LTB metric corresponding to dust in GR corresponds to imperfect viscous fluid in f (R) = R + R2 gravity. Since the density profiles of the two clouds are different, their boundaries (which are determined by vanishing density) are also different. For this fixed metric

9

with no remaining functional freedom of choice, the event horizon, therefore, forms before the formation of the first singularity in GR, but forms together with the formation of the first singularity in f (R) gravity, thereby making the singularity locally visible in GR but globally visible in f (R) gravity.
3. Here, we have defined the boundary of the collapsing cloud having the physical radius corresponding to that comoving radius where the density vanishes. However, in scenarios where the collapsing cloud is such that its density does not vanish but has some known value c at the boundary, the outermost comoving radius rc in f (R) gravity will still be different from that in GR for the LTB cloud. This difference in rc causes the event horizons to evolve differently in different gravity theories, possibly affecting the global causal structure of the first central singularity. This is similar to the case of vanishing density at the boundary, which we have considered.
4. The local causal structure of the singularity is, however, only determined by the behavior of the apparent horizon, which is the boundary of all trapped surfaces, and whose dynamics are completely determined once the governing spacetime metric is known.
5. Matching the interior collapsing spacetime with the exterior spacetime in the framework of f (R) theories of gravity impose a restriction on the otherwise free function S. The spacetime is singular at the matching surface if the junction conditions are violated. We have, however, chosen a specific form of the function S, which is S = r3 - 25.5r6, as an example to show the difference in the global causal structure of the singularity in GR and in f (R) gravity. Whether or not this specific functional form maintains the continuity of the Ricci scalar and its radial derivative has not been investigated. However, even if there is a jump in the curvature term at the boundary, one could physically interpret this violation of the junction condition such that there exists surface stress-energy term on the matching hypersurface and should not be considered unphys-

ical.

6. For an asymptotic observer to be able to observe the singularity, apart from the event horizon to form with the formation of the first singularity, the singularity should also be a nodal point. Here we have argued that because of the discontinuity of the function A (t, r) at (ts(0), 0), the uniqueness theorem of the first-order differential equation does not hold. Hence, there can exist more than one solutions of null geodesic equation starting from (ts(0), 0).
7. It should be noted that studying the global causal structure of the first central singularity formed due to a collapsing cloud requires the explicit expression of the physical radius in terms of t and r. This can be easily obtained in GR in the case of dust collapse using Eq.(6) and Eq.(7) to obtain

A(t, r) = r 2 - St .

However, in GR, in the case of the cloud having non-zero pressure, such explicit expression of A(t, r) is difficult to obtain since integrating the analogous equation of Eq.(4) is not so straightforward. One way to interpret the resulting global visibility, which we show in f (R) is that the LTB metric in f (R) theory governs a collapsing cloud having some pressure as seen in Eq.(23) and Eq.(24). This global visibility seems to be generic in nature as far as small perturbations in the initial data (S, b) is concerned. Now, it seems fairly reasonable to assume that even in GR, one should get a non-zero measured set of initial data for which the end state of a "pressured" collapsing cloud ends up in a globally visible singularity.
