Abstract
We study the problem of stable reconstruction of the short-time Fourier transform from samples taken from trajectories in R2. We first consider the interplay between relative density of the trajectory and the reconstruction property. Later, we consider spiraling curves, a special class of trajectories, and connect sampling and uniqueness properties of these sets. Moreover, we show that for window functions given by a linear combination of Hermite functions, it is indeed possible to stably reconstruct from samples on some particular natural choices of spiraling curves.

1 Introduction

Reconstructing a function from incomplete data is an omnipresent task in fields like signal processing or harmonic analysis. Classically, one aims to reconstruct a function from discrete samples (see e.g. [32, 36]) and the stable version of this problem leads to the notion of frames [11, 13]. For a variety of function spaces, the lower Beurling density [9] (the definition being adapted to the particular geometry of the function space in consideration) of the discrete sampling set needs to exceed a certain threshold in order for the sampling process to form a frame, see for example [1, 22, 29, 31]. This threshold is commonly known as the Nyquist rate.
A more abstract form of the sampling problem is to characterize so called sampling measures [6, 25, 26], i.e. measures µ on X that satisfy

for some A, B > 0 and every F in a given subspace of Lp(X). A common situation is that X = Rd and the measure takes the form µ = Hk, where   X, and Hk, 0  k  d, is the k-dimensional Hausdorff measure. The case k = 0 corresponds to the classical discrete sampling problem. For the second extreme case k = d, it turns out that a weaker notion of density is sufficient to stably reconstruct. For the Paley-Wiener space, this is known as the Logvinenko-Sereda theorem [21, 23] and multiple extensions to other spaces of analytic functions [16, 24, 26] and the range space of the short-time Fourier transform [19] have since been established.
Recently, the study of the intermediate cases 0 < k < d on the Paley-Wiener space P W2() has drawn increased attention and became known in the literature as the mobile sampling problem [34, 35]. Mobile sampling has many applications whenever a signal is measured by a moving sensor like in an MRI scan [8, 34]. Adapting Beurling's lower density for k = 1, the lower path density of a set  (measuring the limit average length of the curve  in a balls of increasing radii) was studied in [14]. In [20], it is shown that a sufficiently large lower path density yields a stable sampling process. On the other hand, there is no Nyquist rate that the lower path density needs to exceed for stable sampling, see [14]. For particularly structured classes of trajectories  however, Nyquist rates were established in terms of certain parameters that characterize the 'separation' of  [18, 30].
In this paper, we study the equivalent of the mobile sampling problem for the shorttime Fourier transform

Vgf (z) = f (t)g(t - x)e-2it dt, z = (x, )  R2.
R
In particular, if M p(R) denotes the modulation space associated to Lp(R2), we study Gabor sampling trajectories for M p(R), that is, trajectory sets   R2 for which

holds. This is a particular instance of a sampling measure for the short-time Fourier transform [6].
Just like in classical Gabor analysis, the stable sampling property relies heavily on both the window g and the trajectory set . On the one hand, one can quickly show that for windows in M 1(R), a necessary condition for  being a Gabor sampling trajectory is that it is relatively dense [6] (see Section 3.1 for the definition). On the other hand, applying a characterization of sampling measures on the Bargmann-Fock space [26] we

2

show that relative density is also sufficient for Gabor sampling trajectories with Gaussian window (see Section 3.2). It is thus hopeless to search for a Nyqist rate both in terms of a path density as well as certain separation parameters that holds for general windows. However, in Proposition 10 we establish that for certain windows it is sufficient that, for R small enough, H1(  BR(z)) is bounded away from zero.
Later, we change perspective and study particular examples of trajectory sets. First, we characterize sampling and uniqueness properties if  is a collection of parallel lines. This will in turn help to study the sampling property of a particular class of trajectories: spiraling curves. Spiraling curves were introduced in [18]. In this article, we work with a slightly more restrictive definition of spiraling curves that nevertheless includes all the examples given in [18]. Loosely speaking, a spiraling curve is a trajectory that (in the limit) in each direction approaches a collection of equispaced parallel lines or equispaced parallel edges. We spare the details for now and refer to Definition 3 and Theorem 17.
Figure 1: Two examples of spiraling curves. Left: The set of concentric circles O. Right: The path S(z1, ..., z4) generated by the points {(-a, a), (a, a), (a, -a), (-a, -a)}.
Beurling's theory of weak limits [9, 10, 32] states an equivalence between sampling sets  for the Paley-Wiener space P W2() and the uniqueness property for all weak limits of translates of  on the Bernstein space P W(). This is a very powerful result as the uniqueness property is often easier to verify. The price one has to pay is that uniqueness has to be shown on a larger space and for all weak limits of translates of the original set. A similar result for sampling measures for the modulation space M p(R) was shown by Ascensi [6]. In case of the measure  dH1, this result states that  is a Gabor sampling trajectory for M p(R) if and only if all weak limits of translates of  are uniqueness sets for the weighted modulation spaces M1p/s (R), s > 2.
In most applications, Beurling's theory is used to derive necessary conditions on sampling sets. In [18] for example, the authors showed that certain weak limits of translates of spiraling curves cannot be uniqueness sets for P W() if the separation exceeds a
3

certain threshold. Together with a result from [8], this yields a full characterization which sets of concentric circles and which Archimedes spirals are sampling trajectories in terms of their separation parameter [18, Theorem A].
We take a different approach in this paper in that we first characterize the set of weak limits of translates of spiraling curves and then show (Theorem 17) that, for windows taken from the linear span of the Hermite functions, the uniqueness property is automatically satisfied for all weak limits of  except for  itself (and its finite shifts). It then follows that  is a Gabor sampling trajectory for M p(R) if and only if  is a uniqueness set for M1p/s (R) for some s > 2 (Theorem 18). Moreover, we prove that certain spiraling curves are indeed uniqueness sets. In particular, our main result is the following.
Theorem 1 Let g  span{hn : n  N0}, 1  p < , and  > 0. Moreover, let (a) P be a star shaped polygon in R2 such that 0  Ker (P ) and no line passing through an edge of the polygon meets the origin, (b) z1, ..., zn  R2, n  3, be such that arg(z1), ..., arg(zn), arg(z1) is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing modulo 2.
The following sets are Gabor sampling trajectories for M p(R): (i) the set of concentric circles O := {(x, y)  R2 : x2 + y2 = 2k2, k  N}, (ii) the collection of star shaped polygons P := {(x, y)  R2 : (x, y)  kP, k  N},
(iii) S(z1, ..., zn), the path generated by the sequence of vectors
{z1, z2, ..., zn, 2z1, 2z2, ..., 2zn, 3z1, 3z2, ...}.
This paper is organized as follows. After a section dedicated to preliminaries, we study some basic examples of windows and trajectory sets in Section 3 and give necessary and sufficient conditions for Gabor sampling trajectories in that setting. Then in Section 4 we introduce spiraling curves and study their weak limits of translates which then allows us to prove our main result.

2 Preliminaries
2.1 Notation
Throughout this paper we adopt the following conventions. We write d for vectors in S1 and () := (cos(2), sin(2)),   T = [0, 1). For d  S1 we write d for the vector obtained by rotating d by /2. The space of continuous, compactly supported functions is denoted by Cc(Rd), and we write A B if there exist C > 0 such that A  CB.

2.2 Hausdorff measure and trajectory sets

Let E  R2. The 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure of E is given by









H1(E)

0

inf

rj : E 

B(xj, rj) and rj   .

j

j

When restricted to a line, H1 equals the 1-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Let  : [0, 1)  [0, ) be continuous in 0. A (locally finite Borel) measure µ is called
-regular if for every z  R2 and every R  (0, 1) one has

µ(BR(z))  (R)R.
A set E  R2 is called -regular if H1|E is -regular. A trajectory   Rd is the image of a curve  : R  Rd, i.e.  = (R), such that
each restriction of  to a finite interval is rectifiable. A trajectory set  is a countable collection of trajectories.

2.3 The short-time Fourier transform and modulation spaces
Let z = (x, )  R2. A time-frequency shift of a function g is given by (z)g(t) = MTxg(t) = e2itg(t - x).
Given a window g  L2(R), the short-time Fourier transform of f  L2(R) is defined as Vgf (z) = f, (z)g = f (t)g(t - x)e-2it dt.
R

The short-time Fourier transform satisfies the following orthogonality relation

Vg1 f1(z)Vg2 f2(z) dz = f1, f2 g1, g2 ,
R2
which implies that, if g = 1, Vg : L2(R)  L2(R2) is an isometry. Let  : R2  R+ be a submultiplicative weight function, i.e. (z + w)  (z)(w).
The (weighted) modulation spaces Mp(R), 1  p  , can be defined by
Mp(R) := f  S(R) : Vh0 f ·   Lp(R) ,
where h0 denotes the normalized Gaussian and S(R) the space of tempered distributions. Modulation spaces are Banach spaces when equipped with the natural norm f M = Vh0f ·  Lp . See for example [13] for a thorough introduction to modulation spaces. Throughout this paper we only consider polynomial weight functions, i.e.,

s(z) = (1 + |z|)s, z  R2, s  0.
We note here that M1s(R) is closed under pointwise multiplication with functions from the weighted Fourier algebra As(R)

As(R) := f  C0(R) : |f ()|s() d <  .
R

In particular, for f  As (R) and g  M1s (R) we have

f g M1s  f As g M1s ,

(2)

see for example the arguments in [17, Proposition 4.13] which can easily be adapted to
the weighted case. Let g  M 1(R). A trajectory set   R2 is called a Gabor sampling trajectory for
M p(R) if there exist constants A, B > 0 such that

A

f  M p(R).

If only the upper bound is satisfied, then we call  a Gabor Bessel trajectory. If p = 2, then M p(R) = L2(R), and (3) is equivalent to {(z)g}z forming a continuous frame, see [5, 28].
The trajectory set  is called a uniqueness set for M p(R), if Vgf | = 0, f  M p(R),

6

implies f = 0.

2.4 Hermite windows and polyanalytic functions

A function F : C  C is called polyanalytic of order n if it satisfies the higher order Cauchy-Riemann equation (¯)n+1F = 0. In that case, F can be written as

n

F (z) = F (z, z) = Fk(z)zk, z  C

(4)

k=0

where F0, . . . , Fn : C  C are holomorphic functions. The Hermite functions are given by

hn(t)

21/4 n!

(5)

For f  Mps(R), 1  p < , the function F given by

F (z) = Vhn f (z)e(z2-z2)/4e|z|2/2,

(6)

is polyanalytic of order n [2], where we identify z = (x, )  R2 with z = x + i  C. In

particular, if g =

n k=0

then

Vgf (z)e(z2-z2)/4e|z|2/2

is

of

A polyanalytic function F of order n is called reduced if it can be written as

n
F (z) = Fk(z)|z|2k, Fk holomorphic.
k=0

Reduced polyanalytic functions satisfy the following Cauchy-type formula [7, Section 1.3, (11)]. For a similar Cauchy-type formula for true polyanalytic functions, see [4].

Lemma 2 (Balk) Let F be a reduced polyanalytic function of order n in BR(0), 0 < R0 < R1 < . . . < Rn < R, and let k := {z : |z| = Rk}. For every z  BR0(0)

2.5 The metaplectic rotation

Let us denote the rotation matrix by R() =

cos(2) - sin(2) sin(2) cos(2)

,   T. The metaplectic

rotation of f  L2(R) is given in terms of the Hermite basis {hn}nN0

µ()f = e-2in f, hn hn.
n0

Clearly, µ() is a unitary operator on L2(R) with µ() = µ(-), and µ()hn = e-2inhn. For f, g  L2(R), the standard rotation of the argument of the short-time
Fourier transform and the metaplectic rotation are connected via the formula

Vgf (R()z) = ei(x-x)Vµ()gµ()f (z), z = (x, ), and (x) = R()z, (8)

or equivalently via (R()z) = e-i(x-x)µ(-)(z)µ(). This is a special case of the

symplectic covariance of the Schro¨dinger representation, see [12, Chapters 1 & 2], and

[13, Chapter 9].

As s is radially extend the operator

symmetric, (8) implies that µ() to M1/s (R) = M1s(R)

f M1s via

=

µ()f

M1s , which allows to

µ()f, g M1/s ×M1s = f, µ(-)g , M1/s ×M1s f  M1/s (R), g  M1s (R).

Consequently, (8) remains valid for f  M1/s (R), and g  M1s(R).

3 General trajectory sets
In this section, we present some basic necessary and sufficient conditions for Gabor sampling trajectories. Moreover, we study the particular cases of (i) Gaussian window with general trajectory sets and (ii) sampling on parallel lines for general windows.

3.1 Relative density
We call a trajectory set   R2 (m, R)-dense if

inf
zR2

BR(z))



m

and relatively dense if there exist constants m, R > 0 such that  is (m, R)-dense. It turns out that relative density is a necessary condition for  being a Gabor sampling trajectory for M p, see [6, Theorem 8 & 10]:

8

Proposition 3 (Ascensi) Let g  M 1(R) and 1  p < . If   R2 is a Gabor Bessel trajectory for M p(R), then there exist M, R > 0 such that

sup H1(  BR(z))  M.

(9)

zR2

If  is a Gabor sampling trajecory for M p(R), then  is relatively dense.

Note that the proof of (9) can easily be adapted to the case p = 2 and general g  L2(R) and explicit upper bounds of the Bessel constant can be derived for example from [3, 4].
The question whether relative density is also necessary for general windows and Gabor sampling trajectories for L2(R) remains open. Drawing comparison to the discrete [29] and planar cases [19] however suggests that relative density should indeed be a necessary requirement.

3.2 Gaussian window
In [26], Ortega-Cerd`a fully characterized the sampling measures for the Bargmann-Fock space of entire functions which corresponds to the short-time Fourier transform with Gaussian window. The result goes as follows.

Theorem 4 (Ortega-Cerd`a) Let 1  p < . The measure µ is a sampling measure for Vh0(M p(R)) if and only if there exist constants R, , M > 0 and N  N such that

(i) sup µ(BR(z))  M,
zR2

n(R, N, , z)

(ii) inf
zR2

R2

> 1,

where n(R, N, , z) is calculated by the following rule: take SR(z) := z + [-R/2, R/2)2 and cover it with N 2 smaller squares of sidelength R/N . Then n(R, N, , z) denotes the
number of smaller squares s  SR(z) for which µ(s)  .

When specifying the measure µ to be the 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure on , we subsequently show that, with a minor extra condition on the trajectory set , condition (ii) is equivalent to  being relatively dense.

Corollary 5 Let h0 be the standard Gaussian window and   R2 be a -regular trajectory set. Then  is a Gabor sampling trajectory for M p(R), 1  p < , if and only
if there exist R, m, M > 0 such that

m  H1(  BR(z))  M, for every z  R2.

(10)

9

Proof: The second inequality of (10) is condition (i) in Theorem 4. Hence, we have to show the equivalence of the left hand side inequality and (ii). If (ii) holds, then

H1(  BR(z))  H1(  SR(z))  n(R, N, , z) > R2.





Now let  be relatively dense and choose N large enough such that ( 2R/N )  2(0).

Then, using the lower bound in (10) and the -regularity of , we get

m  H1(  BR(z))  H1(  S2R(z))

 n(2R, N, , z) sup H1(  S 2R (w)) + (N 2 - n(2R, N, , z))

Remark 6 In [27] it is shown that -regularity with (0) = 1 can be considered as a quantitative strengthening of rectifiability. On the other hand, it is possible to construct fractal sets that are -regular if (0) > 1, which shows that -regularity for some  is a rather mild assumption.

3.3 The case of parallel lines
We now study sampling and uniqueness properties of sets of parallel lines which follow from simple arguments. The results however will be useful later when we study spiraling curves.
Proposition 7 Let g  L2(R),   R be countable, and d = R()e2. The collection of parallel lines Ld,, where
Ld, := td + d : t  R,    ,

10

is a Gabor sampling trajectory for L2(R) with sampling bounds A, B > 0 if and only if

A  |µ()g(t - )|2  B, for a.e. t  R.

(11)



Proof: First, by (8) we can rotate the problem and assume d = e2. Writing the shorttime Fourier transform as Vgf (x, ) = F f Txg () and using Parseval's identity yields

|Vgf (z)|2 dH1(z) =

|Vgf (, )|2 d =

|f (t)g(t - )|2 dt

Le2,

 R

 R

= |f (t)|2

|g(t - )|2 dt,

R



where changing the order of integration and summation is allowed by either (11) or the existence of the upper sampling bound .
The uniqueness property of parallel lines on the distribution space M1/s (R) can be characterized in a similar fashion.

Proposition 8 Let g  M1s (R)  As(R), s  0,   R be countable and d = R()e2. The collection of parallel lines Ld, is a uniqueness set for M1/s (R) if and only if

supp(Tµ()g) = R,

where supp(g) := {t  R : g(t) = 0} denotes the effective support of g.

Remark 9 In [6, Lemma 27], a similar result was shown for planar uniqueness sets. Since some technical details are left out there, we decided to include the proof here.
Proof: For f  M1/s (R), g  M1s (R)  As (R) and h  M1s(R), we define f g via f g, h M1/s ×M1s = f, gh . M1/s ×M1s By (2), it then follows that f g  M1/s (R) as
| f g, h | M1/s ×M1s = | f, gh | M1/s ×M1s  f M1/s gh M1s  f M1/s g As h M1s .
Moreover, since As(R) is invariant under translations it follows that f Txg  M1/s  S(R) and F f Txg  S(R) is thus a well defined tempered distribution.
Since M1s(R) is weak- dense in M1/s (R), and since the short-time Fourier transform of a distribution in M1/s (R) is continuous in R2, it follows that Vgf (x, ) = F f Txg ().

11

As before we may rotate the problem and assume d = e2. Now, Vgf |Le2, = 0 if and only if the distributions f Tg,   , are zero. This in turn is equivalent to the support
of f and the effective support of Tg being disjoint for every   .

3.4 Connection to discrete sampling
Proposition 7 shows that  being relatively dense is not sufficient for  to be a Gabor sampling trajectory. A natural question is whether for g  L2(R)\{0} there exists R > 0 such that every (, R)-dense trajectory set  is a Gabor sampling trajectory if R  R. We follow the approach of [19] to show that such R does in fact exist for a certain class of window functions.
Let us write QR(z) := Rz + [-R/2, R/2)2 and recall the definition of the Sobolev space H1(R) := f  L2(R) : R(1 + ||2)|f ()|2 d <  .
Proposition 10 Let g, tg  H1(R), R > 0 be chosen such that



:=

2R

(12)

and   R2 be a trajectory set. If

0 < m  H1(  QR(z))  M < , for every z  R2,

then
m g 2 -  2 f 2  |Vgf (z)|2 dH1(z)  M g 2 +  2 f 2.


Proof: It is shown in [33] that for the particular choice of g and R, taking arbitrary points zn  QR(n), n  Z2, yields a discrete frame {(zn)g}nZ2 for L2(R) with uniform frame bounds A = g 2 -  2 and B = g 2 +  2.
For every n  Z2 there exists zn    QR(n) such that

|Vgf (zn)|2



H1(

1  QR(n))

|Vgf (z)|2 dH1(z).
QR(n)

Then, as every choice of points zn  QR(n) generates a Gabor frame with uniform upper bound B, we have

|Vgf (z)|2 dH1(z) =

|Vgf (z)|2 dH1(z)

H1(  QR(n))|Vgf (zn)|2  M B f 2.

The lower sampling bound follows with a similar argument.

Remark 11 This construction works for general measures and gives a characterization of sampling measures for this class of window functions.

4 Spiraling curves

4.1 Weak limits

There are multiple ways of defining weak limits of trajectory sets. The definition in [18] for example adapts the initial definition by Beurling [10] which is given in terms of a geometric condition. Here, it will be convenient to work with a stronger notion that was introduced to define weak limits of measures, see [6].

Definition 1 Let , , n be trajectory sets in R2. We say that {n}nN converges

weakly to  if

(z) dH1(z)  (z) dH1(z),

n



for every nonnegative function   Cc(R2). In that case we write n w .
Moreover, we say that  is a weak limit of translates of  if there exists a sequence {zn}nN such that zn +  w .

The following characterization of Gabor sampling trajectories is an immediate conse-
quence of a characterization of samping measures for the short-time Fourier transform
given by Ascensi [6, Theorem 14]. One can think of this result as a time-frequency
analog of the classical result by Beurling [10, Theorem 3, pg. 345] where the Gabor sampling property on M p(R) is connected to the uniqueness property of all weak limits of translates on the larger space M1p/s (R). Note that Ascensi's result requires a special class of windows which we define in a simplified version taylored to polynomial weights.

Definition 2 We say that 1/s controls Vgg if there exist a function d : R+  R+ which is decreasing with d(r)  0, as r  , and satisfies |Vgg(z)|  d(|z|)/s(z). The class M1s(R), s > 2, is then given by

M1s(R) := g  L2(R) : 1/s controls Vgg .

13

Theorem 12 (Ascensi) Let W denote the set of weak limits of translates of , g  M1s(R), s > 2, and 1  p < . Then  is a Gabor sampling trajectory for M p(R) if and only if every   W is a set of uniqueness for M1p/s (R).
4.2 Spiraling curves and their weak limits
The notion of a spiraling curve was introduced in [18]. This class of trajectory sets includes a wide range of natural examples such as the concentric circles or the Archimedes spiral. In this paper, we use a slightly more restrictive notion of spiraling curves that still includes the main examples from [18] and that allows a full characterization of the set of weak limits of translates.
Definition 3 (Spiraling curve) Let I  T be a finite set. A trajectory set  is called spiraling if the following list of conditions is satisfied: If   T\I, then (A.i) (Escape Cone) for  := min{dist(, I), 1/8} the intersection of  with the cone
C, := {(r cos 2, r sin 2) : r  0,  -      + }
can be parametrized in polar coordinates as
() = (r() cos 2, r() sin 2)
with   kN[k +  - , k +  + ] and r a nonnegative C2-function on each interval whose C2-norm is globally bounded. (A.ii) (Asymptotic radial monotonicity) there exist k1  N such that for any   [-, ] fixed, the sequence r(k +  + ) is strictly increasing for k  k1. (A.iii) (Asymptotic flatness) the curvature of , denoted by , tends to 0 as its input goes to infinity. To be more precise, we assume
sup (k +  + )  0, k  .
(-,)
(A.iv) (Asymptotic equispacing) there exist continuous functions  : [-, ]  R+,  : [-, ]  R such that
sup |r(k +  + ) - ()k - ()|  0, k  .
[-,]

k  .

If   I, then (A.i) - (A.v) hold with the following modifications
(B.i) for  := min{dist(, I\{}), 1/8}, the parametrization |[k+-,k++] is continuous and the restrictions of  to (k + , k +  + ] and [k +  - , k + ) are C2-functions with bounded C2-norms.
(B.iii) The curvature of  tends to zero whenever it is well-defined.
(B.v) The velocity vector d is continuous on [-, ]\{0}. Morover, lim0 d() and lim0 d() exist.
Remark 13 (i) The original definition of spiraling curves [18, Section 3.3] only assumed that there exist at least one angle such that the conditions (A.i)-(A.v) are satisfied and did not include angles satisfying (B.i)-(B.v). Let us mention here, that our additional assumptions are also met by the examples mentioned in [18]. In particular, the set of concentric circles is also a spiraling curve in the sense of this paper.
(ii) Since the collection of star shaped polygons and paths generated by a set of points consist of line segments (mostly parallel and equispaces within escape cones), it is a straightforward task to show that these trajectory sets are indeed spiraling curves. The only escape cone that needs more attention is the one that contains the line segments s(kzn, (k + 1)z1). In the limit however, these are parallel and equispaced line segments.
Subsequently, we give a full characterization of the set of all weak limits of translates of spiraling curves. To do so, we establish two technical lemmas that describe the weak limits of zk +  according to a certain geometric condition on the sequence {zk}kN.
Lemma 14 Let zk = -rk(k), k  N, be an unbounded sequence. If there exist no pair (N , ), N  N,   T, such that

(i) {zk}kN is unbounded and (ii) {rk sin(2(k - ))}kN is bounded, then there exist a subsequence {zkn}nN, an angle   T\I, and a constant   R, such

15

that (a) -zkn  (C,), for every n  N, (b) kn  , n  , and
(c) zkn +  w  d + Ld,Z,
where d = limn d(kn - ) and  = ( - ) sin arccos(() · d ) . Moreover, for every   R,   T\I and for d = lim0 d() as well as for
d = lim0 d(), there exist a sequence {zk}kN such that
zk +  w  d + Ld,Z,
with  = (0) sin arccos(() · d) .
Remark 15 The distinction of the two directions (which coincide for   T\I) in Lemma 14 is necessary due to the fact that, for   I, the sets of parallel lines with the left and right limits of the asymptotic velocity as directions are both included in the set of weak limits of translates of .
Proof: Step 1: Since rk sin(2(k - )) is unbounded for every   I and since T is compact we can, after passing to a subsequence, assume that {-zk}kN is contained in the interior of an escape cone C, for some   T\I and that k    [-+, +].
As the problem is rotation invariant, we may for simplicity assume that  = 0. In the following we therefore omit the subscripts in , r, etc.. As zk is unbounded, we can, after passing to yet another subsequence, write zk as
zk = - ()(nk + vk) + () (k),
where nk  N is strictly increasing, vk  [0, 1] converges to v, and ,  are the functions given by (A.iv). If zk +  converges weakly to , then zk + vk()(k) +  converges weakly to v()() + . As zk + vk()(k) still satisfies the assumption of this lemma, we may further simplify notation and assume
zk = -(()k + ())(k).
Step 2: We will later show that the following property is always satisfied: For every compact set K  R2 there exists k  N such that
K  zk + C-|k|,k , k  k.
16

For h  Cc(R2), there exist T, S > 0 and t  R such that the parallelogram

P = (t + t)() + sd() : s  [-S, S], t  [0, T]

satisfies supp(h)  P. Note that T, S can be chosen to depend continuously on   [-, ]. In order to simplify the argument, we define a slightly larger parallelogram P containing P. To this end, let m, M  Z be the largest (respectively smallest) integer such that m()  t, and M()  t + T and define
P = (m - 1/2 + t)()() + sd() : s  [-S, S], t  [0, M - m + 1] ,

as well as the smaller parallelograms

P,m = (m - 1/2 + t)()() + sd() : s  [-S, S], t  [0, 1] , m  m  M.

Since all parameters defining P are continuously depending on , it first follows that the number of smaller parallelograms is bounded by max[-,] T/() + 2. Secondly, there exists a compact set K such that P  K for ever   [-, ]. Consequently, by our previous assumption, for k large enough we have that Pk  K  zk + C-|k|,k.
Step 3: For each k, m, let k,m : Ik,m  R2 be a re-parametrization by arc-length of the segment {zk + (k + m + )}[-,] such that

k,m(0) = zk + (k + m + k) = r(k + m + k) - k() - () (k).

For large values of k, k,m(0) approximates m()(). Applying a first order Taylor approximation yields

k,m(t) - r(k + m + k) - k() - () (k) - tk ,m(0)

(iii) |r(k + m + ) - ()(k + m) - ()| < /4,

(iv) |r(k + m + k) - r(k + m + )| < /4,
whenever k  k. Note that we have used that the C2-norm of r is globally bounded to ensure the last estimate. Now, if t  [-2Smax, 2Smax] and k  k, then, using (13) and triangle inequality, we get

k,m(t) - ()m(k) - td(k)

 |r(k + m + ) - r(k + m + k)| + |r(k + m + ) - ()(k + m) - ()|×

Step 4: It remains to show that the assumption K  zk + C-|k|,k can always be satisfied for k large enough. To this end, we distinguish the cases || <  and

|| = . In the former case, we set  = ( - ||)/2 and observe that for k large

enough

and the left side of the inclusion relation

will eventually cover any compactum.

If || =  and  / I, then it is possible to apply a rotation with a small angle such that  is still the opening angle for the escape cone of  = 0 and || < .

If || =  and   I, then one can rotate the problem so that  = 0. Moreover,

we can without loss of generality assume that k > 0. Let us consider the cone Ck,k . A simple geometric argument shows that

(x, y)  R2 : x  -ak, |y|  bk, and 2bkx + akbk  aky  zk + Ck,k ,

(14)

where ak = rk cos(2k) and bk = rk sin(2k), see Figure 2 for an illustration. The

assumptions that there is no unbounded subsequence of {zk}k such that rkn sin(2kn) is bounded and |k|    1/8 then shows, after possibly passing to yet another subsequence, that zk + Ck,k eventually covers any compactum.
Step 5: To see that every such collection of parallel lines is in fact a weak limit,

we may assume that d = lim0 d() (d = lim0 d() works exactly the same) and

choose

 zk =  d - ((0)k + (0))  + 1/ k ,   T\I.

For this choice, the assumptions of the first part of this lemma are satisfied and one may repeat the arguments to show that zk +  w  d + Ld,Z.

19

Lemma 16 Let zk = -rk(k), k  N, be an unbounded seqence. If there exists a pair (N , ), N  N,   I, such that
(i) {zk}kN is unbounded and (ii) {rk sin(2(k - ))}kN is bounded,
then there exist a subsequence {zkn}nN, and w  R2, such that
zkn +  w w + E,
where the set of parallel edges E is given by
E := k() - td- : k  Z, t  [0, )  k() + td+ : k  Z, t  [0, ) ,
and  =  (0), d- = lim0 d (), and d+ = lim0 d (). Moreover, for every   I and every w  R2 there exist a sequence {zk}kN such
that zk +  w w + E.
Proof: After potentially passing to a subsequence, one can assume that N = N, and that rk is an increasing unbounded sequence. Moreover, by rotation invariance we may assume that  = 0. By assumption, the sequence rk sin(2k) is bounded which shows that there exists a subsequence converging to y. Therefore, after passing to this subsequence, we see that if zk +  converges to , then (-rk cos k, 0) +  converges to (0, -y) + . Therefore, we further simplify the problem and assume that zk = (-rk, 0). From here we can basically proceed as in the proof of Lemma 14 with some minor adjustments.
Let us shortly point out where caution is needed. For h  Cc(R2) the parallelograms need to be replaced by arrow shaped objects defined as follows: let t  R and S, T > 0 be chosen such that the set
Ah := (t + t)e1 - sd-0 : t  [0, T ], s  [0, S]  (t + t)e1 + sd+0 : t  [0, T ], s  [0, S]
contains supp(h). Then one can proceed almost exactly as before by replacing Ph by Ah, using the assumptions (B.iii)-(B.v) of Definition 3 and applying two Taylor expansions for the right and left limits.
Again, we are left with showing that each such set of parallel edges is indeed a weak limit of translates. Setting zk = w - ((0)k + (0))(),   I, however yields that zk +  w w + E .
20

Theorem 17 The set of weak limits of translates of a spiraling curve  is given by

W = S  L  E,

where S = {z +  : z  R2}, E = w + E :   I, w  R2 , and

where  is defined as in Lemma 14.

Proof: It follows from Lemma 14 and Lemma 16 that S  L  E  W. Now let zk + w . If zk  C, then there exist a converging subsequence zkn  z
and it follows that  = z +   S. If {zk}kN is unbounded, then either there exist N  N and   I such that {zk}kN is unbounded and {rk sin(2(k - ))}kN is
bounded, or not. Hence, the assumption of either Lemma 14 or Lemma 16 are satisfied which leaves us with the limit  being either a set of parallel lines or a set of parallel
edges, i.e. W  S  L  E.

4.3 Spiraling curves as Gabor sampling trajectories

After characterizing the set of all weak limits of translates we can now prove our main
results. We first show that, for a certain class of windows, spiraling curves are Gabor
sampling trajectories if and only if they are uniqueness sets for the weighted modulation space M1p/s (R). Later, we then verify that certain spiraling curves are indeed such uniqueness sets.

Theorem 18 Let   R2 be a spiraling curve, g  span{hn : n  N0}, and 1  p < . Then  is a Gabor sampling trajectory for M p(R) if and only if  is a uniqueness set for M1p/s (R) for some s > 2.

To show this theorem we first need to state two auxiliary lemmas. The first one is a consequence of [15, Corollary 3.9(c) & Proposition 2.2].

Lemma 19 If there exist  > 0 such that |g(t)| |Vgg(z)| 1/s(z), for every s > 0.

e-|t| and |g()|

e-||, then

The following lemma is a simple consequence of [6, Corollary 26].

Lemma 20 Let g  span{hn : n  N0}. For every f  M1p/s (R), 1  p < , z  R2, and   T, it holds that Vgf (z + t()) is a real analytic function in t  R.

21

Proof: First, observe that Vgf (z + t()) is real analytic if and only if

Vgf R()R(-)(z + t()) = Vµ()g(µ()f ) R(-)z + te1

is real analytic. For   T one has that µ()g  M1s(R) by Lemma 19 and |µ()g(t)| e-|t|. Since the metaplectic rotation leaves M1p/s (R) invariant, it follows by [6, Corol-
lary 26] that Vµ()g(µ()f ) R(-)z + te1 is real analytic.

Proof of Theorem 18: First, observe that g  M1s(R) by Lemma 19. We may therefore apply Theorem 12. By Theorem 17, the set of weak limits of translates consists of finite
shifts of  and the sets of parallel lines and edges. As Vgf (z-w) = e2iyVg(w)f (z), and M1p/s (R) is invariant under time-frequency shifts, it follows that z +  is a uniqueness set for M1p/s (R) if and only if  is a uniqueness set for M1p/s (R).
We now show that every set of parallel lines (resp. parallel edges) is a unique-
ness set. To show the two cases at once, we prove that any collection of parallel half
lines {kd1 + td2 : t  0}, d1, d2 not colinear, and  > 0, is a uniqueness set for M1p/s (R). Since Vgf restricted to a line in R2 is real analytic by Lemma 20, it follows that Vgf |{kd1+td2: t0, kZ} = 0 implies Vgf |{kd1+td2: tR, kZ} = 0.
The function µ()g is also a linear combination of Hermite functions and thus has only
finitely many zeros. Therefore, it follows that kZ supp(Tkµ()g) = R for every  > 0. Finally, as g  As(R), we may apply Proposition 8 to see that Vgf |{kd1+td2: tR, kZ} = 0 implies f = 0.

Corollary 21 Let g  span{hn : n  N0}, 1  p < ,  > 0. Moreover, let P  R2 and {z1, ..., zn}  R2 be such that the assumptions (a) - (b) in Theorem 1 are satisfied.
The collection of star shaped polygons P and S(z1, ..., zn) are Gabor sampling trajectory for M p(R).

Proof: Take a line   R2 that contains one of the edges of P (resp. that contains
the line segment s(z1, z2)) and consider the collection {k}kN. If Vgf |P = 0 (resp. Vgf |S(z1,...,zn) = 0), then, as Vgf is real analytic on any line k and zero on a subset of nonzero measure, it follows that Vgf |{k}kN = 0. Arguing as before, we get
kN supp(Tkµ()g) = R. Therefore, it follows that that f = 0.

Corollary 22 Let g  span{hn : n  N0},  > 0, and 1  p < . The collection of concentric circles O is a Gabor sampling trajectory for M p(R).

Proof: For g =

Then Vgf (z) = 0

22

exactly when F (z) = 0. Multiplying F by zn changes the zero set of F at most in the origin, and results in a reduced polyanalytic function. By assumption, and since O = O we hence have that znF |O = 0. By Lemma 7, it thus follows that F (z) = 0 for every z  BR0(0), where R0 can be chosen arbitrarily large. Consequently, F (z) = 0 for every z  C which implies that f = 0 and O is a uniqueness set for M1p/s (R).
