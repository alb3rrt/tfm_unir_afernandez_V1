We theoretically study the stability of magnetic skyrmion crystals (SkXs) in chiral cubic antiferromagnets with the EuPtSi hosting unconventional nanometric SkXs in mind. By performing numerical simulations for a minimal effective spin model with the long-range Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and the multiple-spin interaction arising from itinerant nature of electrons, we clarify two key ingredients for the emergence of the SkXs in EuPtSi: One is the lowsymmetric ordering vectors that lead to the field-direction sensitive SkXs in an external magnetic field, while the other is the synergy between spin-charge and spin-orbit couplings in itinerant magnets that results in the nanometric SkXs. The present study will not only provide the microscopic mechanism of the SkXs in EuPtSi but also guide for a search of further materials hosting short-period SkXs.

A topological spin texture that accompanies a spin scalar
chirality by a triple spin product, Si · (S j × Sk), has received much attention in recent years, as it becomes a source of versatile emergent electromagnetic responses.1­6) A mag-
netic skyrmion is a prototype of such topological spin textures.7­9) Although the skyrmion crystal (SkX) has been originally observed in noncentrosymmetric magnets10,11) where
the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction plays an important role,12­15) it has been recently observed in centrosymmetric magnets16­18) by the frustrated exchange interactions19­22) and/or the multiple-spin interactions in itinerant magnets.23­25) The essential feature by the different origins
appears in the magnetic modulation period in the SkXs: The
SkXs by the former mechanism usually lead to much longer magnetic periods than those by the latter ones.26) Especially,
a small skyrmion induces a large emergent magnetic field,
and hence engineering the small skyrmion is promising for
future spintronics applications, since it has great advantage to energy-efficient devices based on high density topological objects.27)
The cubic chiral antiferromagnet EuPtSi is a typical com-
pound to host such a SkX with the small magnetic period.28­31) The lattice structure of EuPtSi with the space group P21332,33) is common to that of B20 compounds like MnSi,10) and as a result, both compounds show similar temperaturefield phase diagrams.28) Nevertheless, the magnetic periods of the SkXs are quite different with each other, e.g., 1.8 nm for EuPtSi29,30) and 18 nm for MnSi,34) which results in giant topological Hall resistivity 0.12 µ cm in EuPtSi28) compared to 4.5 ×10-3µ cm in MnSi.35) This implies that the short-
period SkX in EuPtSi is not accounted for by the conventional
DM-interaction-driven mechanism, which needs other factors as mentioned above. Moreover, there is another difference in
a magnetic-field angle dependence. The magnetism and con-
ductivity in EuPtSi are sensitive to the magnetic-field directions;36,37) the signature of the SkX is observed when the magnetic field is in the [111] and [001] directions,31,37­39) while
that in MnSi is observed irrespective of the magnetic-field direction.40) In order to open up a way to the small skyrmion
engineering for practical applications, it is important to un-
derstand the key ingredients of the short-period SkX in EuPtSi

and to clarify the differences from MnSi. In the present study, we theoretically study the stability of
the nanometric SkX with the EuPtSi in mind. We consider a minimal effective spin model with long-range RudermanKittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY),41­43) biquadratic, and DMtype antisymmetric interactions that arise in itinerant magnets. By performing simulated annealing, we find that our effective model well explains the mechanism of the short-period SkX and its behavior against the field direction. There are two essences in the stabilization of the field-direction sensitive nanometric SkX: One is the low-symmetric ordering vector which brings about highly anisotropic responses against the field direction, and the other is the interplay between the longrange DM interaction arising from the spin-orbit coupling and the biquadratic interaction arising from the spin-charge coupling. We show that a fine balance between them determines the stability of the SkXs depending on the field directions. Our study will provide a reference not only to engineer the short-period SkX but also to explore further skyrmion-hosting materials in noncentrosymmetric itinerant magnets.

the second term, and the DM-type antisymmetric interaction with D Q and | D| = D in the third term. In the derivation, we neglect two contributions. The one is the symmetric
anisotropic bilinear interaction originating from the higher-
order contribution of the spin-orbit coupling compared to the
DM interaction, where we assume the small spin-orbit coupling.44) The other is the four-spin interactions different from (SQ · S-Q )2 by assuming the distinct peak structures of the bare susceptibility of itinerant electrons.24) The last term is the
Zeeman coupling to an external magnetic field H whose directions are taken at H [111], [001] and [110] with |H| = H. For simplicity, we neglect the higher-order contributions ap-
pearing under the magnetic field, such as the three-spin interactions.24) We take J = 1 as the energy scale.
There are two key ingredients in the model in Eq. (1). One is that the model includes the effects of both spin-charge and spin-orbit couplings, whose interplay induces nanometric
topological spin crystals, such as a square SkX on a square lattice44) and a hedgehog crystal on a cubic lattice.45,46) As
the dominant interaction channels arise at the wave vectors
at which the Fermi surfaces are nested, the short-period SkX
naturally appears depending on the band structure and elec-
tron density. Furthermore, it is shown below that a small long-
range DM interaction is enough to stabilize the short-period
SkX in contrast to the short-range one that requires an unre-
alistic large value unless the other (multiple-spin) interactions
are taken into account.
The other is the symmetry of {Q}. Although the dominant wave vectors are determined by the bare susceptibility de-
pending on the electronic band structure and electron filling,
we here suppose twelve low-symmetric ordering vectors {Q} with n = 12, which are not lied on the high symmetry line and are connected by the symmetry operation under P213. Specifically, we set Q1 = (-Qa, -Qb, -Qc), Q2 = (-Qc, -Qa, -Qb), Q3 = (-Qb, -Qc, -Qa), (Q4, Q8, Q12) = Rz(Q1, Q2, Q3), (Q7, Q11, Q6) = Ry(Q1, Q2, Q3), and (Q10, Q5, Q9) = Rx(Q1, Q2, Q3) with Qa = 2/15, Qb = 2/5, and Qc = 8/15, where R ( = x, y, z) represents  rotation around the  axis. This mimics the situation of EuPtSi where the SkX under the [111] field has the triple-q vectors, q1 = (-3, 1, 2), q2 = (-2, 3, -1), and q3 = (1, 2, -3) for 1  0.09, 2  0.20, and 3  0.29.29,30) The positions of {Q} are shown in Fig. 1, where each {Q} is projected onto the (111) [Fig. 1(a)], (001) [Fig. 1(b)], and (110) [Fig. 1(c)] planes.
These low-symmetric ordering vectors are important to in-
duce a field-direction sensitive SkX, as shown below.

Let us first study the low-temperature phase diagram of

the model in Eq. (1) at K = 0 on the cubic lattice for

Figure 2(a) displays the magnetic phase diagram under

H [111] at K = 0 while varying D and H. Although a large

portion of the phase diagram is occupied by the single-Q spi-

ral state, the SkX emerges for nonzero D in the intermediate

H region; the SkX is stabilized for D 0.05 and the region

extends while increasing D. We show H dependences of the

spin and chirality related quantities at D = 0.3 in Figs. 3(a)

and 3(b). At H = 0, the single-Q spiral state is stabilized

where the spiral plane is perpendicular to Q owing to the DM

interaction. When applying H, the single-Q spiral states with

Q1, Q2, or Q3, which are connected by the threefold rotational symmetry around the [111] axis [Fig. 1(a)], are chosen among

twelve Q so as to maximize the Zeeman energy gain to favor

the conical spiral perpendicular to H. Accordingly, the spiral

plane is tilted from Q1 (or Q2, Q3) to [111] direction while increasing H, as shown in Fig. 3(b).

While further increasing H, M jumps and  becomes

nonzero, as shown in Fig. 3(a). This state is characterized by

the triple-Q state whose threefold-symmetric ordering vec-

tors Q4, Q5, and Q6 on the same (111) plane show equal intensities [see also Fig. 1(a)]: (mQx 4 )2 = (myQ5 )2 = (mzQ6 )2, (myQ4 )2 = (mzQ5 )2 = (mQx 6 )2, and (mzQ4 )2 = (mQx 5 )2 = (myQ6 )2. These features signal the emergence of the SkX. Indeed, the

skyrmion cores form a triangular crystal projected onto the

(111) plane, as shown in Fig. 3(c). Simultaneously, the local

chirality at the center of the square plaquette R, R, also forms

the triangular crystal, resulting in a net scalar chirality as ex-

pected for the SkX. We confirm that this state has an integer

skyrmion number. The increment of H in the SkX leads to the first-order phase transition to the single-Q spiral state again, and continuously turns it into the fully-polarized state.
The results indicate that the SkX is stabilized by considering D irrespective of K under the [111] field. Notably, the SkX appears for a relatively small D, e.g., D/J 0.05, which means that the present model does not require a large DM interaction in contrast to the conventional spin model with the short-range interactions.48) Furthermore, we find that the emergent SkX is sensitive to the magnetic-field directions; no SkX appears under the [001] and [110] field directions, as shown in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c), respectively.
Next, we consider the effect of K, which arises from the spin-charge coupling in itinerant magnets and tends to enhance the instability toward the SkX.24) We find that the introduction of K can induce the SkXs even for H [001] and H [110]. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) [Figs. 4(c) and 4(d)] show the H dependences of M, , and mQ for H [001] (H [110]) at K = 0.05 (K = 0.08). Both results show a similar phase sequence to that under H [111] in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b); the single-Q spiral state in the low-field region, the triple-Q SkX in the intermediate region, and again the singleQ spiral state in the high-field region before entering the fullypolarized state.

Meanwhile, the nature of the single-Q spiral states and the SkXs under each field direction is qualitatively different in terms of degeneracy in {Q}. For H [001], there are four degenerate spirals with Q1, Q4, Q7, and Q10 and four degenerate SkXs with (Q4, Q5, Q6), (Q1, Q9, Q11), (Q2, Q7, Q12), and (Q3, Q8, Q10), as shown in Fig. 1(b). For H [110], there are two degenerate spirals with Q3 and Q12 and two degenerate SkXs with (Q4, Q5, Q6) and (Q1, Q9, Q11), as shown in Fig. 1(c). The q vectors in the single-Q spirals are selected so as to maximize the parallel component to the magnetic field, while the triple-Q vectors in the SkXs are chosen to satisfy Q + Q + Q = 0 (,  ,  = 1-12) and to form the plane perpendicular to the field direction. Although the SkX in the [111] field satisfies the above conditions, those in the [001] and [110] fields do not fully satisfy the latter condition; the plane by the constituent triple-Q vectors is tilted to the fields. As a result, the magnetization perpendicular to the fields is induced [Figs. 4(a) and 4(c)], which leads to the Zeeman energy cost compared to the [111] field.
Thus, the critical values of D and K for the SkXs in each field direction are different. Figure 5 shows the phase diagram to denote the appearance of the SkXs for H [111], [001], and [110]. Although the SkX for H [111] appears in almost all the regions including K = 0 or D = 0, while that for H [001] and H [110] emerges only for K 0. The critical values of K tend to be smaller for the [001] field than the [110]

field, which might be attributed to the Zeeman energy loss of the single-Q spiral state for H [001] compared to that for H [110]. In other words, the DM interaction tends to favor the SkXs in particular field directions, while the biquadratic interaction stabilizes the SkXs irrespective of field directions. This result provides useful information for understanding the key ingredients in field-direction sensitive SkXs observed in EuPtSi, as discussed below.
Finally, let us compare our results with the relevant material EuPtSi, which hosts the short-period SkXs depending on the magnetic-field direction; the topological Hall effect was observed along the [111] and [001] fields down to low temperatures, while they were not observed along the [110] field; especially, the SkX phase was identified in the [111] field.28­31,37­39) These anisotropic phase diagrams against the field direction are reproduced by the model parameters in the green region in Fig. 5, which clearly suggests the importance of both spin-orbit and spin-charge couplings that might arise from the interplay between Eu-4 f localized spins and Pt-5d itinerant electrons with the strong spin-orbit coupling. The model also captures that the SkX is surrounded by the singleQ spiral state. These observations indicate that our effective spin model on the basis of the itinerant electron model well describes SkX physics in EuPtSi. One of the remaining issues is unidentified two successive phases (called A'-phase and B-phase) appearing in the [001] intermediate field,31,38,39) where the single SkX phase emerges in our results. Recalling that there are four degenerate SkXs in the [001] field, the degeneracy lifting by introducing an additional magnetic anisotropy and other multiple-spin interactions that are not taken into account in the model might be important to investigate the above two phases. In fact, it was shown that the magnetic anisotropy different from the DM interaction can also induce the SkXs and is relevant with the skyrmion-hosting materials,49, 50) such as GdRu2Si218, 51­53) and Gd3Ru4Al12.17, 54) Thus, a further investigation to incorporate such additional magnetic anisotropy and multiple-spin interactions might be useful to clarify the origin of unidentified phases, which will

LETTERS
be left for a future interesting issue. To summarize, we have theoretically investigated the sta-
bility of the SkXs in chiral antiferromagnets on the basis of the minimal effective model phenomenologically taking into account long-range interactions characteristic of itinerant magnets. We showed that the interplay between the spinorbit and spin-charge couplings stabilizes the nanometric SkX by performing simulated annealing. We also found that the spatial anisotropy that arises from the low-symmetric ordering vectors is enough to describe the field-direction sensitive SkXs. Our model well reproduced the SkXs observed in the 4 f -electron compound EuPtSi. Although more realistic model parameters based on the density-functional theory calculation might be desired for a further comparison, the effective spin model will be a good starting model to capture SkX physics in EuPtSi. Moreover, as the effective model is universal in RKKY-driven itinerant magnets, the present results will be a useful reference to understand complex magnetic phases in other f -electron compounds, where the recent experiments imply the SkXs, such as EuPtGe55) and EuAl4.55,56)
