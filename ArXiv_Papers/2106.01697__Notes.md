## Abstract

For a quantum system modeled by the self-adjoint part $B_\mathrm{sa}$ of a $C^*$-algebra $B$, we also introduce a "semi-classical object" called the Gelfand spectrum. It is the ortho-set, $P(B)$, of pure states of $B$ equipped with an "ortho-topology", which is a collection of subsets of $P(B)$, defined via a hull-kernel construction with respects to closed left ideals of $B$. We establish a generalization of the Gelfand theorem by showing that a bijection between the Gelfand spectra of two quantum systems that preserves the respective ortho-topologies is induced by a Jordan isomorphism between the self-adjoint parts of the underlying $C^*$-algebras (i.e. an isomorphism of the quantum systems), when the underlying $C^*$-algebras satisfy a mild condition.

## Comments

It is the preprint (before peer review) version of a paper to appear in J. Phys. A. The names for some terminologies are changed in the publised version; in particular, "quantum sets" are now called "ortho-sets" to avoid confusion with existing terminologies
