ABSTRACT. Over the last few years of the heyday of hybrid halide perovskites, so many metal cations additives have been tested to improve their optoelectronic properties that it is already difficult to find an element that has not yet been tried. In general, the variety of these approaches is united under the name "doping", however, there is currently no clear understanding of the mechanisms of the influence of the metal ion additives on the properties of the lead halide perovskite materials. For many ions there is even no consensus on the most fundamental questions: what lattice position does a given ion occupy and is it incorporated in the structure at all? Here, we derived a system of effective radii of different metal ions in the iodine environment for the set of iodide compounds and reveal their crystal chemical role in the APbI3 perovskites. We analysed the possible lattice positions for 40 most common monovalent, divalent, and trivalent metals to reveal whether they could successfully enter into the perovskite structures. We show that, at most, three parameters -- effective size, electronegativity and the softness of metal ions are the main ones for crystal chemical analysis of the possibility of metal doping of hybrid halide perovskites. Our results provide a useful theoretical guidance to rationalize and improve current doping strategies of hybrid halide perovskites with metal ions.
Introduction Over the past decade, hybrid halide perovskites (HHPs) have remained on the list of the hottest
innovative materials for photovoltaics and optoelectronics due to their unique set of intrinsic

properties, such as a direct band gap, strong optical absorption [1], long charge carrier lifetime [2,3] and remarkable tolerance to defects [4]. Despite the exceptional progress in the efficiency of solar cells and other perovskite-based devices achieved mainly due to the improvement of existing synthetic methods and optimization of device architectures [5], the potential of these strategies for further boosting the device`s efficiency has been largely exhausted. Therefore, there is a growing demand for approaches to fine-tuning the optoelectronic properties of perovskites, in particular, through doping.
Importantly, the doping approaches and mechanisms of perovskites differ drastically for hybrid perovskites from those of conventional semiconductors (Si, GaAs) due to the unique chemical and structural origin of the perovskites. Primarily, the nominal doping levels (1-10 mol%) most commonly used for HHPs [6][7][8] are exceptionally high compared to the conventional semiconductors. Such a high concentration of impurity ions leads potentially to two scenarios: substitution (if possible in terms of the size, electronegativity, and chemical nature of the ion) or the formation of composites containing secondary phases [9,10]. The effect of composite formation in a number of cases lead to an improvement in the functional properties of the perovskite layer, but it does not relate to the doping of the material itself, possibility and character of which is the main focus of this article.
Despite the great number of experimental efforts, the rational development of doping approaches for HHPs is hindered by the absence of unambiguous answers on basic questions, concerning the possibility of inclusion of a given ion in the structure as well as its preferable lattice position. Noteworthy, in most works, the doped perovskites were investigated only in terms of the resulting device`s efficiency or by experimental methods with limited sensitivity, such as XRD and XPS providing no unambiguous information about the concentration of the dopant and the mechanism of doping. Unfortunately, reliable experimental techniques on the local structure such as solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ss-NMR) were applied only for selected metal ions [9­12].

In this article, we provide a systematic study of matching of different metal ions to available lattice sites in the structure of three most common halide perovskites: CsPbI3, MAPbI3, and FAPbI3. For this purpose, we calculated and analyzed the effective radii for 40 most common monovalent, divalent, and trivalent metal ions in iodine environment of different compounds valuable as dopants for halide perovskites. The proposed methodology has demonstrated a good agreement with existing experimental data and is proposed to rationalize doping strategies.
Methods System of ionic radii. To elucidate appropriate lattice sites for a given ion, a reliable system of ionic radii is required. The direct application of traditional concepts of ionic radii for iodide compounds is fraught with considerable errors due to the larger size and the less electronegativity of iodine compared to oxygen and fluorine for ionic compounds basically used in the concept of Shannon radii and tolerance factors [13][14]. There are two ways to eliminate this inaccuracy: (1) introducing corrections to the reference radius values based on the average M-X bond length [15] or (2) direct calculation of effective ionic radii from alternative appropriate sets of structural data. The latter can be accurately and facilely calculated as the equivalent radii of spherical domain (Rsd) of Voronoi-Dirichlet Polyhedra (VDP) derived (see SI), for example, from corresponding space partitioning implemented in the TOPOSPro software package [16,17]. Being calculated for each ion from a representative set of experimentally refined crystal structures of iodide compounds (including HHPs), the Rsd-based effective ionic radii, by default, take into account the shortening of the M-I bond for various metals due to a covalent bond contribution. Moreover, Rsd for a given atom depends only on the oxidation state, electronic configuration, and the type of neighboring atoms, being approximately constant in different structures and different coordination numbers. Therefore, the single Rsd value can be used for different possible lattice sites of a given doping ion (Mn+) in the crystal structure to elucidate the most appropriate one. In addition, the Rsd can be calculated with a high accuracy even for ions

with a high degree of polyhedral distortion and irregular coordination, which made it ambiguous to define their ionic radii within traditional hard-sphere models. From this point of view, the effective radii of ions (Rsd) are more suitable parameter for estimation of effective sizes of doping ions and its possible locations in lead halide perovskites.
Dopability criterions. In principle, three possible variants of an insertion of a foreign ion into the ABX3 perovskite structure can be distinguished: the substitution of cations A or B at their own sites, or occupation of an interstitial site. So, comparison of the ionic radius of an impurity ion with the size of a given crystallographic site should be considered as a first descriminating criterion of dopability. The sizes of A and B crystallographic sites in APbI3 lead iodide perovskites were quantitively estimated as the Rsd values of A+ and Pb2+ cations averaged for different polymorphs (Fig. 2). The Rsd values for other ions considered as possible dopants were calculated from a number of corresponding compounds with metal ions in iodine environment from Materials Project database [18].
It should be noted that the effective radius of any of the ions depends substantially on the bond ionicity (e.g. Rsd of Pb2+ decreases significantly in the PbI2-PbBr2-PbCl2-PbF2 series), but is almost the same in similar environment even despite of the change in the structural type (e.g. from layered PbI2 to perovskite APbI3, see Fig. 2, a). Therefore, we assume that the sizes of ions in the B site can be assumed to be almost the same for all hybrid lead iodide perovskites. At the same time, Rsd of a given ion in the same environment has a small scatter even for homologous structures. Typically, this scatter is within ± 5% which was chosen as the limiting deviation of the size of the ion occupying a given position (plotted as orange regions on Figures 1-2 and S3S8 in SI).
In the case of doping via partial Pb substitution in the HHPs structures, an equally important crystal-chemical criterion for the possibility of metal doping is a difference in electronegativity of dopant metal (M) with iodine:  = (I) - (M). Therefore, the offset of  between Pb and doping metal (()) should not exceed the empirical value of 0.4-0.5 eV-1/2. In the present

study, the  values were calculated based on two electronegativity scales: the Pauling one [19] and the one recently proposed by Tantardini and Oganov [20].
The third criterion that takes into account the contribution of the polarizability and ability to be polarized when chemically bound of the cation is softness. Ions with a higher softness usually form stronger complexes with iodide anions, therefore, being in an iodine environment is more energetically favorable for them. Among the many known scales of softness, we have chosen the consensus scale published in [21] as the most correlated with the experimental properties of ions.

Results and discussions We will consider three types of point defects resulting from foreign metal ion (Mn+) implementation in APbI3 perovskite structure (electric charges and lattice positions described within Kröger­Vink notation):

1)

( , , and in the case of n = 1, 2, 3);

2)

( , , and in the case of n = 1, 2, 3);

3) (for ions in tetrahedral interstitial sites).

A-site doping Due to the large size of cuboctahedral A+ cation site, its doping with a metal ion is, in fact,

exclusively represented by the case of substitution with a large monovalent cation (isovalent

substitution ( )) since all the divalent metal cations are much smaller. According to the calculated values of Rsd, among the monovalent cations, only Cs+ has a satisfactory large size to partly substitute the organic MA+ and FA+ cations in the structure (Figure 1a, Figures S3 and S6 in SI). The effective radii of Rb+, K+, and Tl+ are too small to occupy the A site and

simultaneously they do not fit to the B site (Figure 1a, Figures S3 and S6 in SI), which indicates

that these cations can not be incorporated in the APbI3 structure at all. In the case of admixing of some salts based on these ions into perovskite precursor solution, the latter should lead to

separate crystallization of pure perovskite phase without dopants and with secondary phase(s)

containing Rb+, K+, and Tl+ cations. This conclusion fully agrees with experimentally proved by ss-NMR formation of KI and KPbI3 secondary phases for K+ [9] as well as RbPbI3, RbI1-xBrx, and Cs0.5Rb0.5PbI3 ones for Rb+ [10]. When non-perovskite wide-bandgap phases of potassium and rubidium are segregated on the grain boundaries [22], they might block an interfacial non-

radiative recombination as well as inhibit intralayer diffusion of iodine and organic cations in

solar cells, which explains the well-known improvement of optoelectronic properties [23] and

suppressed hysteresis [24][25] of resulting film and solar cells respectively.

B-site doping Monovalent cations. The two smallest alkali cations in six-fold coordination, Na+ and Li+,

have an admissible mean ionic size to occupy the B positions in the structure of perovskites. However, the large offset in  and in hardness for these cations compared to for Pb2+ should

prevent them from replacing lead in the APbI3 perovskite. Considering the significant discrepancy in the electronegativity of both the ions according to the both scales used, it can be

assumed that their dopability is limited by low concentrations. The possible

( )

substitution generates negatively charged defects, which should be compensated by positively

charged defects such as iodine vacancies ( ) and/or holes (h) (see eqs. in SI). This conclusion

agrees well with a large increase of both ionic and electronic conductivity and pronounced p-

doping of MAPbI3 perovskite films and single crystals when PbI2 in a precursor solution is partially replaced with NaI [26][27][28] and significant upward shift of the Fermi level with LiI

additive [29] (Table S2). Among the monovalent cations of coinage metals (Cu+, Ag+, Au+), the silver has the most
appropriate size,  and softness to be included in the B-site. Since the average Rsd of Cu+ and Au+ is only of 10% smaller than that of Pb2+ in iodine environment and  is within the limits, a

moderate local lattice distortion can also allow them to replace partially lead ions. Similar to

sodium, doping of perovskite by these ions should lead to p-type conductivity (if the original

material is intrinsic semiconductor). This result is consistent with the decrease in conductivity by

one order of magnitude due to the weakening of n-type doping of resulted MAPbI3 perovskite film prepared with the addition of the CuI and AgI salts [30]. Possibilities of other variants of doping are discussed in SI.

Divalent cations. For the case of doubly charged ions, due to their relatively small size, two doping scenarios can be realized: substitution of lead in B sites or occupation of a fourcoordinated interstitial (tetrahedral) positions with corresponding generation of charge balancing defects. An analysis of the diagram in Fig. 2, b shows that Sn2+ has the closest size and  to lead in perovskite, predictably forming a continuous series of APb1-xSnxI3 solid solution in the entire range of compositions [31]. Divalent mercury is another ion that satisfies all three dopability criterions, having a nearly ideal ionic size, low , and high softness. The solubility limit of HgI2 in PbI2 having been experimentally determined to be only 600 ppm [32], which can be explained by the difference in structural types of the two iodides. In the case of MAPbI3, much higher doping limit can be expected from the recent study of Frolova et. al [33]. According to these data, the secondary Hg-rich phases become visible by XRD starting from 20% of HgI2 and higher only.
On the other hand, there are two large groups of doubly charged cations that definitely cannot replace lead in iodide perovskites. The first of group includes Pt2+, Pd2+, Mo2+, Ni2+, V2+, Be2+, and Mg2+ ions, which in similar iodide environment are much smaller than Pb2+. Among them, the soft cations of d-metals such as Pt2+, Pd2+, Mo2+, which prefer the four-fold iodine coordination and have a relatively small offset of  (and, therefore, the low expected effective charge), may occupy the interstitials if they are complexed with negatively charged defects such as . The second group includes ions of alkaline earth metals (except the Mg2+ and Be2+) and Eu2+; all of them have a large enough size to occupy the octahedral void in the perovskite structure, however the offset in  is too large, and thus bulk doping at a reasonable level should be excluded. In the absence of suitable positions for incorporation, these ions, apparently, are not capable of doping iodide perovskites. Therefore, additives based on them should be considered exclusively as modifying (passivating) the surface or modulating the crystallization. As for the Ba2+, this conclusion is fully corresponds to the EDS-mapping and ss-NMR results indicating respectively the non-uniform distribution and formation of secondary Ba-rich phases for

CsPb(I0.66Br0.33)3 perovskite [34]. Similarly, in the case of Sr2+, XPS and XAS spectra clearly indicate a strong enrichment of surface by the dopant and formation of surface phases [35].
Another set of divalent cations, including Ge2+, Co2+, Fe2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, and Mn2+, is

characterized by much more ambiguous doping behavior. All these ions are smaller than lead

and have a borderline size. Therefore, to differentiate their role in doping, it is necessary to

compare their  and softness. The difference in electronegativities increases in the

aforementioned series from left to right, whereas softness increases in the following series Pb2+ > Ge2+ > Cd2+  Co2+ > Fe2+ >> Zn2+ > Mn2+ (Table S1), where the first four ions are

principally soft like lead and the last two ones are relatively hard. Based on the two above mentioned criterions, we can assume that Ge2+ions, which are closest to Pb2+ in all three

parameters, are most likely suitable to substitute the lead in APbI3 perovskites. Interestingly, even the relatively soft Cd2+ and Co2+ cations, as confirmed by ss-NMR, can not be

incorporated into the MAPbI3 perovskite structure at doping levels as low as 1 mol % [11,12]. This fact can serve as an evidence of the presence of a rather sharp lower boundary of the

limiting size for the ion replacing the B position at a level of about 5% of Rsd. Accordingly, for Fe2+, Zn2+, and Mn2+ ions, it can be concluded that doping through , substitution is hardly

possible. Trivalent cations. Among trivalent cations and rare earth elements, the Sb3+ and Bi3+ are the

most suitable in terms of the average effective radius for entering the B site in MAPbI3, FAPbI3

and CsPbI3 (Figure 2, Fig. S5 and S8 in SI) perovskites. It has been shown experimentally that

Bi3+ and Sb3+ can generate

defects in halide perovskites acting as n-dopants [36,37]. Such

defects also generate sub-gap levels in iodide perovskites resulting in significantly red-shifted

optical bandgap [38] and acting as recombination centers lowering the photoluminescence

quantum yield [39]. As for the trivalent cations of 13 group, the In3+ have simultaneously average ionic size nearly
equal to Pb2+, very close value of softness and appropriate . Having a lower electronegativity

than lead, In3+ is expected to create no sub-gap electronic levels due to higher splitting of * and * orbitals and, therefore, can be considered as a good choice for n-doping of iodide perovskites. In contrast, Ga3+, having average Rsd outside of ± 5% limits and lower softness, is most likely not capable to dope the lead halide perovskites.
The trivalent cations of rare-earth metals (La3+, Ce3+), likely rare earth cations, have a suitable size to enter the B-sites, but a great offset in the electronegativities and differences in the softness between these cations and Pb2+, and that should prohibit the substitution. Therefore, despite the many evidences of control the emission properties of bromide and chloride perovskite nanocrystals [40­44] by the addition of lanthanide additives, such trick are hardly possible for APbI3 iodide perovskites.

The discussed considerations regarding possible dopants and their influence on the optoelectronic properties of MAPbI3 are summarized in the Table 1. It should be noticed that there are obvious differences in the dopability of MA-, FA-, and Cs-based perovskites by the same ion, caused by the difference in the size of A and B lattice sites in their structures (see Figures 1-2 and Figures S3-S8). Especially, the increased Rsd(Pb2+) for FAPbI3 in comparison with MAPbI3 makes the substitution of MPb type more unlikely for ions close to the lower limit of the admissible effective radius, such as Cu+, Ag+, Au+, and Li+.

Conclusions To sum up, we found that the most important parameters affecting the doping of lead iodide perovskites are the effective sizes (Rsd) of doping metal ions, their difference in electronegativity () and the softness. To calculate the effective sides of metal ions we introduce new scale of ionic radii based on Rsd parameters calculated from the set of structures containing these ions in iodine environment. Using the proposed approach, we show that among monovalent alkali metal cations, Cs+ and Rb+ are suitable to occupy the A-site, while K+ should form secondary phases and passivate the grain boundaries. The Cu+, Ag+, Au+, Na+ and Li+ can occupy B-site and cause the p-doping of HHPs. The most suitable divalent cations for doping with entering in the B site are Sn2+ and Hg2+. Among the trivalent cations, Sb3+, In3+, and Bi3+ are the most suitable to occupy the B-site and to induce the n-doping of HHPs. Ag+, Cu+, Au+ (CN = 4), Pt2+, Pd2+, Mo2+, and Ni2+ can localize in tetrahedral interstitial positions as also associated with negatively charged defects, leading to n-type doping and increased ionic conductivity due to the migration of foreign cation. Finally, our results provide a guidance for improving current doping engineering strategies of lead iodide perovskites by metal ions.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Voronoi-Dirichlet Polyhedra approach Effective atomic size in crystal structure correlates with geometrical parameters of atomic
VDP: a convex polyhedron whose faces are perpendicular to segments connecting the central atom of VDP and other atoms. In the general case, the coordination polyhedron of an ion in crystal structure is dual to the VDP (Figure S1). The VDP characterize either relative, or the absolute atomic size in crystal structure [1].

Possible doping scenarios for monovalent, divalent and trivalent cations The following are the main doping scenarios that are possible in the cases of occupation of position A by a single-charged (1), double-charged (2), and triple-charged (3) cation; occupation of position B by a single-charged (4), double-charged (5), and triple-charged (6) cation, as well as occupation of tetrahedral interstitial positions (it) by single-charged (7), double-charged (8), and triple-charged (9) cations. For each of the doping equations, possible equilibria leading to generation of charge carriers (free electrons e- and holes h+) through the ionization of formed defects or the removal of components are given. Also, each of the equations is combined with equation (0) of the self-doping of perovskite due to the formation of the most common anti-Frenkel defects.

0)  +  + + e-

(Eq. 0)

Hereinafter, we assume that the formation of interstitial iodide as a stable defect is hardly possible due to geometric considerations (Rsd(I-) >> Rsd(it)); therefore, the iodide anions occupying the interstitials should be ionized. 1) M+  A

0 + MI = + AI Scenario is possible for following ions: Cs+.

(Eq. 1)

Result: no effect on type of conductivity, no traps. 2) M2+  A 0 + MI2 = + + AI  + + e- + AI  + e- + AI + I2

(Eq. 2)

Scenario is possible for following ions: (no double-charged metal ions with size enough to

occupy the A site are known)

Result: n-doping

3) M3+  A 0 + MI3 = + + AI  + + e- + AI  + e- + AI + I2

(Eq. 4.1)

0 + MI + AI = + + 2 +

{ + + e-} +

{ + + e-} + MI + AI = + + 3 + h+

Scenario is possible for following ions: Cu+, Ag+, Au+, Na+, and Li+ (if CN = 6).

(Eq. 4.2) (Eq. 4.3) (Eq. 4.4)

Result: "dedoping" of initially n-doped perovskite, increase of ionic conductivity (due to increase of concentration) or p-doping in the case of [Pb2+]/[M+] stoichiometric replacement in solution; traps formation is possible if the ion can change the oxidation state (Cu+, Ag+, Au+). 5) M2+  B

+ MI3 = + PbI2

(Eq. 5.1)

0 + AI + MI2 = + + 3

(Eq. 5.2)

Scenario is possible for following ions: Sn2+, Hg2+, Ge2+.

Result: no-doping, trap formation (especially, change of the oxidation state of Sn2+ and Ge2+).

(Eq. 6.2) Scenario is possible for following ions: Bi3+, Sb3+, In3+. Result: n-doping, trap formation for Bi3+, Sb3+. 7) M+  it 0 + MI = +  + + e-  + e- + I2

(Eq. 7.1)

0 + + MI = + + AI Scenario is possible for following ions: Cu+, Ag+, Au+, and Li+ (if CN = 4). Result: n-doping, traps formation.
