Abstract We study anomalies of fermions with spacetime dependent mass. Using Fujikawa's method, it is found that the anomalies associated with the U (N )+ × U (N )- chiral symmetry and U (N ) flavor symmetry for even and odd dimensions, respectively, can be written in terms of superconnections. In particular, the anomaly for a vector-like U (1) symmetry is given by the Chern character of the superconnection in both even and odd dimensional cases. It is also argued that the non-Abelian anomaly for a system in D-dimensional spacetime is characterized by a (D + 2)-form part of the Chern character of the superconnection which generalizes the usual anomaly polynomial for the massless case. These results enable us to analyze anomalies in the systems with interfaces and spacetime boundaries in a unified way. Applications to index theorems, including AtiyahPatodi-Singer index theorem and Callias-type index theorem, are also discussed. In addition, we give a natural string theory interpretation of these results.

1 Introduction
Quantum anomaly is one of the fascinating topics in quantum field theory. It implies important constraints to have a consistent gauge theory and provides powerful tools to investigate non-perturbative properties of quantum field theory. It has been used to discuss phase structures of strongly coupled systems and give non-trivial evidence
2

of conjectured dualities. Another interesting aspect of the anomaly is its beautiful mathematical structures. In particular, the relations between the anomalies and various index theorems have attracted much attention and have been vigorously studied by both physicists and mathematicians.
In this paper, we investigate perturbative anomalies in the systems with N Dirac fermions including spacetime dependent mass as well as external gauge fields associated with U(N )+ × U(N )- chiral symmetry or U(N ) flavor symmetry for even or odd dimensional cases, respectively. The spacetime dependent mass is equivalent to an external scalar field (Higgs field) that couples with the fermions through the Yukawa coupling. Although the masses of the quarks and leptons in nature are considered to be constant, spacetime dependent mass naturally appear in the standard model and various other models when the value of the Higgs field is not constant. It also appears in hadron physics and condensed matter physics, because the effective mass of fermions can vary depending on some parameters of the environment, such as temperature, chemical potentials, magnetic field, strength of the interaction, etc., which can be spacetime dependent.
Apart from possible applications to realistic systems, the spacetime dependent mass can be used as a theoretical tool to study quantum field theory. For example, it can be regarded as an external source coupled to a fermion bilinear operator. In particular, although the U(N )+ × U(N )- chiral symmetry is explicitly broken to a subgroup when the mass is non-zero, we can make the action invariant under the U(N )+ × U(N )- gauge transformation (3.7) by promoting the mass to a spacetime dependent external field. Then, we are allowed to discuss the anomaly for this symmetry even though the mass is non-zero. In this sense, the spacetime dependent mass plays a similar role as the external gauge field, with which the action becomes gauge invariant. Furthermore, it can be used to study chiral fermions localized on an interface or fermions in a spacetime with boundaries. When we make the mass very large except for some regions in spacetime, the low energy modes are trapped in the regions with small masses and effectively induces a system with boundaries. If the mass profile has a zero locus of non-zero codimension, it represents an interface defined by the mass. As we review in section 4.1, it is possible to realize Weyl fermions localized in such interfaces. This mechanism is widely used to construct theories with chiral fermions in lattice gauge theories, phenomenological models of elementary particles with extra dimensions, etc.
In fact, the anomaly for the fermions with spacetime dependent mass (Higgs field) was analyzed in the 80's in [1, 2]3. The conclusion of these papers was that the mass does

3

not contribute to the anomaly at all. This is true in the case that the mass is bounded and fixed while the cut-off scale is sent to infinity. However, as we will demonstrate, the mass dependence of the anomaly survives when the mass is unbounded. Remarkably, we will also find that the anomaly exists even for odd dimensional cases, when the spacetime dependent mass is introduced. Our discussion is closely related to that of recent papers by Cordova et al. [4, 5], in which coupling constants including the masses are promoted to external scalar fields, and the anomalies are extended to include them. They analyzed the systems with massive fermions in [4] and found that the space of masses can be considered as a compact space with non-trivial topology by including |m|  , and anomalies in D-dimensional systems are characterized by a (D +2)-form, which is a generalization of the usual anomaly polynomial, involving differential forms on the space of masses. This also shows that it is crucial to consider |m|   to have a non-trivial anomaly that involves the masses.
The main goal of the first half of this paper (section 3) is to show that the anomaly (D + 2)-form as well as the anomaly associated with U(1)V symmetry are given by the Chern character written in terms of the superconnection introduced by Quillen in [6]. This was also suggested in [4]. We will show this explicitly by using Fujikawa's method. Our formulas (3.58) and (3.60) can be used for both even and odd dimensional cases, provided that the superconnection of the even and odd types are used accordingly.
These results are probably not surprising for those who are familiar with the ChernSimons (CS) terms including the tachyon field in unstable D-brane systems, which are written with the Chern character of the superconnection.[7, 8, 9, 10] As we will discuss in section 5, the systems with Dirac fermions in various dimensions can be realized on a D-brane with unstable D9-branes. The mass of the fermion is proportional to the value of the tachyon field and hence the spacetime dependent mass can be naturally obtained by considering a varying tachyon field. The anomaly of the fermions is supposed to be canceled by the contribution from the CS-term. Therefore, string theory suggests that the superconnection appears in the formulas of anomaly, which is indeed what we find in the field theory analysis.
The rest of the paper (section 4) is devoted to the applications of these formulas. We consider the systems with interfaces and boundaries realized by the spacetime dependent mass. Most of the discussion there are consistency checks and demonstration of our formulas (3.58) and (3.60). We show in several explicit examples that some known results can be consistently reproduced in a simple and unified way. The results of section 4.2.2 are new. In this section, a system with a spacetime dependent boundary condition is considered and the anomalies due to this boundary condition are obtained.
This paper is organized as follows. We start with a brief review of the supercon-
4

nection in section 2. In section 3, we derive our main formulas for the anomaly with spacetime dependent mass using Fujikawa's method. Applications of these formulas are given in section 4. The cases with interfaces and boundaries are studied in sections 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and implications to index theorems are discussed in section 4.3. The systems with spacetime dependent mass can be realized in string theory and our results have natural interpretations in string theory as explained in section 5. Finally, in section 6, we summarize our results and make concluding remarks.

2 Superconnection

In this section, we briefly review the superconnection introduced by Quillen in [6] with physicist-friendly notations. Our description here is not as general as that given in the original paper, but restricted to the cases to be used in the following sections. See, e.g., [6, 11] for more general and mathematically rigorous descriptions. A superconnection4 A of the even type is a matrix valued field composed of U(N) × U(N) gauge fields (A+, A-) and a bifundamental scalar field T as

A=

A+ iT  iT A-

= A+e+ + A-e- + iT + + iT - ,

(2.1)

where

e+ = 1 0 00

, e- = 0 0 01

, + = 0 1 00

, - = 0 0 10

. (2.2)

In our notation, the gauge fields A± = A±µ(x)dxµ are one-forms that take values in anti-Hermitian N × N matrices. ± in (2.1) and dxµ are treated as fermions, i.e., they
anti-commute with each other in the products. The field strength of the superconnection is defined as5

F  dA + A2 =

F+ - T T iDT  iDT F- - T T 

,

(2.3)

where

F±  dA± + A2± , DT  dT + A-T - T A+ , DT   dT  + A+T  - T A- .

(2.4)

4In this paper, the word "superconnection" is used for the field A rather than the covariant deriva-
tive d + A, which is often used in mathematical literature. 5The products of differential forms are the wedge product, though the symbol for the wedge product
`' are omitted.

(2.5)

where [· · · ]k denotes the k-form part of the differential form in the square brackets and `Str' is the supertrace6 defined by

Str a b  Tr(a) - Tr(d) . (even case) cd

(2.6)

Because of (2.6), only the even form part in (2.5) can be non-zero. A useful formula for a one-parameter family of superconnections denoted as At with
a parameter t  [0, 1] is

1

Str eF1 - Str eF0 = d

dt Str eFttAt ,

0

(2.7)

where Ft = dAt + A2t . For At = A|T tT = A0 + tT with A0 = A+e+ + A-e- and T = iT + + iT -, this formula implies

1

Str eF = Tr(eF+) - Tr(eF-) + d

dt Str eFtT .

0

(2.8)

Since Str(eFtT ) is gauge invariant, (2.8) implies that ch(F ) and ch(F+) - ch(F-) are equivalent up to an exact form. For a trivial bundle (or, in a local patch) the formula (2.7) with At = tA implies7

1

Str eF = d

dt Str etdA+t2A2 A .

0

This implies that the Chern character can be expressed locally as

6In some literature, the symbol `Str' is used for the symmetrized trace, which should not be confused with the supertrace in this paper. For the symmetrized trace, we use Trsym.
7When the gauge group is U (N+) × U (N-) with N+ = N-, the right hand side has an additional
constant term N+ - N-.

This  is, in general, not gauge invariant.
The superconnection of the odd type is given by (2.1) with the restrictions A+ = A- and T = T :

A=

(2.14)

 The reason for putting the normalization factor 2 i-3/2 will become clear later.8 We also define an analog of the Chern character for the odd case by the same formula as above (2.5). In this case, only the odd form part contributes. The formulas (2.7)­(2.11) also hold for the odd case. In particular, (2.8) with A+ = A- and T = T  gives

1

(2.15)

where Ft = (F - t2T 2)12 + itDT 1. Therefore, the Chern character can also be written as

3 Derivation of the anomaly

3.1 Even dimensional cases
3.1.1 Massive fermions and chiral anomaly
In this section, we consider a system with N Dirac fermions  in a D = 2r-dimensional flat Euclidean spacetime (r  Z>0). We include external gauge fields A = (A+, A-) associated with U(N )+ × U(N )- chiral symmetry and a spacetime dependent mass m, which belongs to the bifundamental representation of U(N )+ × U(N )-.9 The action is

S = dDx +D/ ++ + -D/ -- + -m+ + +m- = dDx D , (3.1)

µ and µ (µ = 1, 2, · · · , D) are 2r-1 × 2r-1 matrices satisfying

(3.2) (3.3)

µ + µ =  µ + µ = 2µ ,

9Although we discuss N Dirac fermions, it is easy to get the results for N± positive/negative

chirality Weyl fermions by considering a U (N+)+ × U (N-)- subgroup of U (N )+ × U (N )- with large

enough N .

10This notation is useful for our purpose, but is not a standard one. A more standard notation is

obtained by replacing  and D with 

01 10

and

01 10

D, respectively.

The crucial point here is that we allow the mass parameter m to depend on the spacetime coordinate xµ and regard it as an external scalar field, which is sometimes called a Higgs field in the literature, that plays a similar role as the external gauge fields A+ and A-. Then, the classical action is invariant under U(N )+ × U(N )- chiral gauge transformation that acts on the external fields as well as the dynamical fermions as

+  U++ , +  +U+-1 , -  U-- , -  -U--1 , A+  U+A+U+-1 + U+dU+-1 , A-  U-A-U--1 + U-dU--1 , m  U-m U+-1 , m  U+mU--1 ,

(3.7)

with (U+(x), U-(x))  U (N )+ × U (N )-. As it is well-known, the chiral symmetry is anomalous in quantum theory. In fact,
when the external fields are non-trivial, the partition function

Z[A, m]  e-[A,m]  [dd] e-S(,,A,m)

(3.8)

gets a non-trivial phase under the chiral gauge transformation (3.7), even though the action is invariant.
Let us briefly review the explicit form of the anomaly for the massless case. Under an infinitesimal chiral gauge transformation (U+ = e-v+, U- = e-v- with v+, v-  1) with

vA+ = dv+ + [A+, v+] , vA- = dv- + [A-, v-] ,

(3.9)

The effective action for the massless case [A]  [A, m = 0] defined in (3.8) transforms as    + v with

v[A] = I21r(v, A) ,

(3.10)

where I21r(v, A) is a 2r-form obtained as a solution of the descent equations11 dI21r = vI20r+1 , dI20r+1 = I2r+2
with

(3.11)

I2r+2(A) = -2i [ch(F+) - ch(F-)]2r+2 .
11See, e.g., [12, 3, 13, 14] for reviews of the anomalies.

(3.12)

9

Here, [· · · ]2r+2 denotes the (2r+2)-form part of the differential form in the square brack-

ets and ch(F±) = Tr

is the Chern character. I2r+2(A) is called the anomaly

polynomial and I20r+1(A) is the CS (2r + 1)-form.12

As pioneered by Fujikawa in [15, 16], the chiral anomaly (3.10) can be understood

as a consequence of the fact that the path integral measure for the fermions is not

invariant under the chiral transformation (3.7). After a careful regularization, it can

be shown that the fermion path integral measure transforms as

[dd]  [dd] J

(3.15)

with the Jacobian J given by

log J = I21r(v, A)

(3.16)

under the infinitesimal chiral transformation, reproducing the result in (3.10). The form of the Jacobian J in (3.15) depends on the regularization. In [16, 1], a
manifestly gauge covariant form of the anomaly with

log J = I21rcov(v, A) ,

(3.17)

where

I21rcov(v, A) =

i 2

r1 r!

Tr(v+F+r ) - Tr(v-F-r )

(3.18)

is obtained with a covariant regularization. (See section 3.1.2.) This form of the anomaly is called the covariant anomaly, while (3.10) is called the consistent anomaly. Unlike the consistent anomaly, the covariant anomaly does not satisfy the descent equations (3.11) and cannot be written as the gauge variation of a well-defined effective action. The consistent and covariant anomalies are related by the addition of a Bardeen-Zumino counterterm in the associated currents.[17]

12In this paper, we consider a flat spacetime. For curved spacetime, ch(F ) should be replaced with ch(F )A(R), where A(R) is the A-genus. Explicit expressions for I20r+1(A) and I21r(A) are

up to closed forms and contribution from local counterterms, where Ft±  tdA± + t2A2± and Trsym stands for the symmetrized trace.

10

We are particularly interested in the anomaly for the U(1)V transformation which corresponds to v+ = v- = -i(x) 1N with a function (x) and the unit matrix 1N .13 In this case (3.18) is

(3.19)

The main claim of this section is that, when the spacetime dependent mass m
is turned on, the Chern character ch(F+) - ch(F-) appeared in (3.12) and (3.19) are replaced with the Chern character written by the superconnection (2.5). More explicitly, the anomaly polynomial I2r+2(A) in (3.12), the covariant anomaly I21rcov(v, A) in (3.18) and the U (1)V anomaly I21rcov(v, A) in (3.19) are replaced with

I2r+2(A, m) = -2i [ch(F )]2r+2 ,

I21rcov(v, A, m) =

I21rcov(-i, A, m) = -i [ch(F )]2r ,

(3.20) (3.21) (3.22)

respectively, where v  diag(v+, v-), m  m/ is the mass rescaled by the cut-off  (see (3.37) for the definition) and

F=

F+ - mm iDm iDm F- - mm

(3.23)

is the field strength of the superconnection (2.3) with T = m. (3.20) is related to I21r(v, A, m) that gives the consistent anomaly

v[A, m] = I21r(v, A, m)

(3.24)

by the descent equation (3.11).14 Since I2r+2(A, m) is not a polynomial of the field strength F , we refer to it as an anomaly (2r + 2)-form following [4]. (3.21) is the covariant anomaly related to the Jacobian J defined with a covariant regularization adopted in section 3.1.2 by

log J = I21rcov(v, A, m) .

(3.25)

(3.22) is obtained from (3.21) by setting v+ = v- = -i1N . In (3.24) and (3.25), we take    limit after the integration.
13More precisely, what we are concerned here is the mixed anomaly between U (1)V and SU (N )+ × SU (N )- × U (1)A.
14See section 4.1 for more on the use of the anomaly (D + 2)-form (3.20).

11

Note that when m is bounded, m vanishes in the limit    and the m dependence drops out.[1, 2] However, there are some physically interesting systems in which the mass is of the order of cut-off scale or unbounded, and the m dependence in the anomaly may survive. For example, a system with a boundary can be realized by setting m   in a region of the spacetime. Another interesting example is a system with localized massless fermions on an interface (defect) with mass of order cut-off scale in the bulk, such as the domain-wall fermions used in lattice QCD [18]. We will consider such examples in section 4.
Another related issue is that, as it was shown in [6], the de Rham cohomology class of (3.20) is independent of m because of the relation (2.8), which would mean that the m dependent part of (2r + 2)-form (3.20) does not contribute to the anomaly. This is true in a compact spacetime. However, for an open space, the m dependent part of the anomaly (2r + 2)-form can give a non-trivial element of the cohomology with compact support.15 As we will discuss in section 4.1, this non-trivial element is interpreted as the anomaly of the fermions localized on the interfaces located around the zero locus of the mass profile. The local counterterm that cancels this anomaly is the contribution from the anomaly inflow.
In section 3.1.2, we will explicitly show (3.21) and (3.22) using Fujikawa's method, following the prescription given in [1]. Our argument for (3.20) is more indirect. This is suggested as a consequence of the relation (3.19) between the non-Abelian anomaly in 2(r - 1)-dimensions characterized by I2r(A) and the Abelian anomaly given by I21rcov(-i, A) in 2r-dimensions [19, 20] generalized to the cases with spacetime dependent mass. This issue will be discussed in section 3.1.3.

3.1.2 Calculation of the Jacobian

In order to show (3.21) and (3.22), we evaluate the Jacobian J in (3.15) for the U(N)+× U(N)- transformation (3.7). In the following, we demonstrate the derivation of (3.22) in detail focusing on the U(1)V transformation that acts on the fermions as

(x)  ei(x)(x) , (x)  e-i(x)(x) ,

(3.26)

which is a special case of the transformation in (3.7) with U+ = U- = ei1N . The generalization to general U(N )+ × U(N )- transformations that leads to (3.21) is straightforward.
Following [1], we expand the fermion fields  and  with respect to the eigenfunctions of the Hermitian operators DD and DD, respectively. Let n and n be the

DDn(x) = 2nn(x) , (n  { k - n | k = 1, 2, 3, · · · }) , DDn(x) = 2nn(x) , (n  { k - n | k = 1, 2, 3, · · · }) ,
and the normalization conditions

(3.27) (3.28)

dDx m(x)n(x) = m,n ,

dDx m(x)n(x) = m,n .

(3.29)

Here, the eigenvalues of DD and DD are denoted as 2n, because they are non-negative and can be written as the square of real numbers.17 Without loss of generality, we
assume n = 0 for n  0 and 0 < 1  2  3  · · · . Note that the eigenvalues for (3.27) and (3.28) are the same, because the non-zero modes n and n with n > 0 are related by

16Here, we have assumed that the spectra of DD and DD are discrete. Later, we will consider the cases with non-compact spacetime. In such cases, the asymptotic behavior of the mass and the gauge fields should be chosen appropriately to have discrete spectra.
17Be aware that n is not the eigenvalue of D. D is not Hermitian and its eigenvalues are not real in general.

matrix as

m = µ(x)1N ,

(3.48)

19In section 4, we consider the cases with m being a linear function of xµ. One may wonder whether
m can be regard as an O(1) parameter, even though m diverges at |x|  . In that case, our treatment here can be understood as the evaluation of the    limit of the integration dDx (x)I(x) by using rescaled coordinates xµ = xµ/.

3.1.3 Anomaly (D + 2)-form

In this subsection, we give a simple derivation of the anomaly (D + 2)-form (3.20) using the result (3.22) for the U(1)V anomaly. Although the description here is for the even dimensional case, the argument is applicable to the odd dimensional case as well.
We decompose the U(N )+ × U(N )- gauge fields into the U(1)V gauge field V and the rest, and write the Chern character as

ch(F )

=

ei 2

f

V

ch(F0)

,

(3.51)

where f V  dV is the field strength of the U (1)V gauge field and F0  F |fV =0 = F - f V 12N . First, we try to show (3.20) for the case with f V = 0. To this end, let us consider the U(1)V anomaly (3.22) with f V = 0 in a (D + 2)-dimensional system:

ID1 c+o2v(-i, A, m)|fV =0 = -i[ch(F0)]D+2 .

(3.52)

Note that for this component of the anomaly, there is no difference between the covariant and consistent anomalies.20 The anomaly (D + 4)-form for the (D + 2)-dimensional system that reproduces (3.52) via the descent equations (3.11) is

f V [ch(F0)]D+2 .

(3.53)

Now, consider a (D + 2)-dimensional spacetime of the form S2 × MD, where MD is a D-dimensional manifold. We assume that f V has a flux with S2 f V = -2i and F0 is independent of the coordinates on S2. In this case, each fermion in the (D + 2)dimensional system has one zero mode on S2 and hence we get a D-dimensional system with N Dirac fermions in the limit that the radius of the S2 becomes zero. The anomaly (D + 2)-form for this D-dimensional system is given by integrating (3.53) over S2,
yielding

ID+2(A, m)|fV =0 = f V [ch(F0)]D+2 = -2i [ch(F0)]D+2 , S2
20We thank Y. Tanizaki for the discussion on this point.

(3.54)

16

which is (3.20) for the f V = 0 case. The f V dependence of the anomaly (D+2)-form can be easily recovered by replacing
F0 with F , which completes the derivation of (3.20).

3.2 Odd dimensional cases
3.2.1 Anomaly in odd dimensions
In this section, we consider a system with N Dirac fermions  in a D = (2r + 1)dimensional flat Euclidean spacetime (r  Z0). The flavor symmetry is U(N ) and the associated external gauge field is denoted as A. We include a spacetime dependent mass m, which is a Hermitian matrix of size N and belongs to the adjoint representation of U(N). The action is

S = dDx  D/ + m  = dDx D ,

(3.55)

where

D/  µ(µ + Aµ) , D  D/ + m ,

(3.56)

and µ (µ = 1, 2, · · · , 2r + 1) are gamma matrices satisfying µ = µ and {µ, } = 2µ. For explicit computation, we choose µ to be of the form (3.5) for µ = 1, · · · , 2r and 2r+1 in (3.6) for µ = 2r + 1. This action is invariant under the U(N ) flavor symmetry:

  U  ,   U -1 , A  U AU -1 + U dU -1 , m  U mU -1

(3.57)

with U(x)  U(N). Our claim is that the formulas analogous to (3.20), (3.21) and (3.22):

ID+2(A, m) = -2i [ch(F )]D+2 ,

ID1 cov(v, A, m) =

i 2

D/2
Str v eF

D,

ID1 cov(-i, A, m) = -i [ch(F )]D ,

(3.58) (3.59) (3.60)

hold even for the odd dimensional cases, using the odd dimensional analog of the Chern character (2.5) defined by the supertrace for the odd case (2.14). Unlike the even dimensional cases discussed in section 3.1, both (3.58) and (3.60) vanish when the mass m vanishes. The anomaly appears only when m is turned on.
We will show in section 3.2.2 that the formula (3.47) for the U(1)V transformation (3.26) also holds for the odd dimensional cases by examining the Jacobian of the fermion

17

path integral measure using Fujikawa's method. This implies (3.60). The derivation can be easily generalized to (3.59). (3.58) follows from (3.60) by an indirect argument given in section 3.1.3.
The meaning of (3.58) is somewhat more ambiguous, because, for odd D, we can find a gauge invariant (D + 1)-form ID0 +1(A, m) satisfying ID+2(A, m) = dID0 +1(A, m) (See (2.16).) Then, the odd dimensional analogue of the descent equations (3.11):

dID1 = vID0 +1 , dID0 +1 = ID+2

(3.61)

would imply that the anomaly ID1 simply vanishes. However, as we will see in section 4.1.1, ID0 +1(A, m) is non-vanishing at infinity in our examples with non-trivial interfaces and ID+2 can be a non-trivial element of the cohomology with compact support.21 We
will argue that the anomaly of the fermions on the interfaces can be extracted from the
formula (3.47).

3.2.2 Calculation of the Jacobian

The Jacobian of the fermion path integral measure for the U(1)V transformation (3.26) in the odd dimensional case can be calculated in a similar way as that for the even dimensional case in section 3.1.2. In particular, (3.35), (3.37) and (3.42) can be used for the D = (2r + 1) case with F and F  defined as

F

1 22

m

-

m2

,

F

Fµ

.

(3.62)

Note that F  is obtained by replacing µ with -µ in F. Therefore, when the matrix in the trace in (3.42) is expanded with respect to µ , only the terms with odd numbers of µ can contribute. Furthermore, using the relation22

tr (µ1 · · ·  ) µ2k+1 =

0

(k < r)

(2i)rµ1···µ2r+1 (k = r) ,

(3.63)

we find that (3.44) also holds for the odd dimensional case, and

Trs eF - eF d2r+1x = -(2r+1)(2i)r+1/2 Str eF 2r+1 + O(-(2r+1)-1) , (3.64) where F is the superconnection of the odd type given by (2.13) with T = m = m/:

F=

F - m2 iDm iDm F - m2

.

(3.65)

21 A similar statement holds for the mass dependent part of the Chern character I2r(A, m) for the
even dimensional case, as mentioned in section 3.1.1 and demonstrated in section 4.1.2. 22Here, 2r+1 is chosen to be the same as in (3.6).

18

Note that we have taken into account the 2i-3/2 factor in the definition of the supertrace `Str' for the odd case (2.14). Then, we obtain

I(x)d2r+1x =

i 2

(2r+1)/2
Str eF

2r+1 = [ch(F )]2r+1 .

(3.66)

This implies

log J = -i (x)[ch(F )]2r+1 ,

(3.67)

which takes the same form as (3.47) for D = 2r + 1. In particular, when the mass is a scalar matrix given by
m = µ(x)1N ,
with a real function µ(x), we have ch(F ) = 1 dµ e-µ2ch(F ) ,
and log J = - i dµ e-µ2 (x) [ch(F )]2r ,
where µ  µ/.

4 Applications

4.1 Anomalies on interfaces
In this section, we consider mass profiles with isolated zero loci, which we call interfaces, and show that the anomaly carried by the fermions localized on the interfaces can be easily extracted by the formulas obtained in section 3. As pointed out in [4, 21], the anomaly of the localized modes implies the existence of a diabolical point in the space of parameters of the theory, which will be mentioned at the end of section 4.1.3.

4.1.1 Kink (codimension 1 interface)
We consider a D = (2r + 1)-dimensional system given by (3.55) with a kink-like mass profile as

m = µ(y)1N = uy1N ,

(4.1)

19

where y  x2r+1 is one of the spatial coordinates and u is a real parameter. Since the mass m diverges at |y|  , the operators DD and DD have discrete spectra as required in section 3.1.2.
To simplify the discussion, we assume that the gauge field as well as (x) are independent of y. Then, the integration over y in (3.70) can be done and we obtain

log J = -i sgn(u) (x) [ch(F )]2r ,

(4.2)

where sgn(u) = u/|u| is a sign function and the integration is taken over the 2rdimensional space along x12r directions. Note that this result is independent of the cut-off , and hence it survives in the    limit. The dependence on the parameter u is only through its sign. Knowing this fact, for some purposes, it may be convenient to take the |u|   limit as

lim ch(F ) = sgn(u)(y)dy ch(F ) .
|u|

(4.3)

In fact, (4.2) does not depend on the detail of the profile (4.1). As it is clear from (3.70), we get the same result (4.2) for any function µ(y) satisfying µ(y)  ± (or µ(y)  ) as y  ±.
The expression (4.2) agrees with the anomaly for Weyl fermions in a 2r-dimensional spacetime. In fact, (4.2) is identical to (3.17) with (3.19) provided we identify (F+, F-) = (F, 0) for u > 0 or (F+, F-) = (0, F ) for u < 0. We interpret this as the anomaly contribution from the Weyl fermions localized on the interface at y = 0. As a check, it is easy to show that there exist positive or negative chirality Weyl fermions at the interface as the zero modes of the operator D = D/ + m with u > 0 or u < 0, respectively.[22] To see this, let us consider the Dirac equation D = 0, where D is defined in (3.56). Working in the A2r+1 = 0 gauge, this equation can be written as

D/ (2r) + 2r+1y + µ(y) = 0 ,

(4.4)

where

2r
D/ (2r) = µ(µ + Aµ)
µ=1

(4.5)

is the Dirac operator in the 2r-dimensional space. Then, we find a solution localized around y = 0:

(x,

y)

=

e-

1 2

|u|y2

(2r)(x)

(4.6)

20

where x = (x1, · · · , x2r) and (2r)(x) is the 2r-dimensional Weyl fermion at the interface satisfying

D/ (2r)(2r) = 0 , 2r+1(2r) = sgn(u)(2r) .

(4.7)

Note, however, that the anomaly contribution of the localized Weyl fermions are known to be canceled by the contribution from the bulk via the anomaly inflow mechanism [23]. Outside the region with µ(x) = 0, the one loop effective action contains a term with the CS (2r + 1)-form, whose gauge variation precisely cancels the anomaly of the localized fermions. Our result (4.2) can be interpreted in two ways. One is that the variation of CS-term simply vanishes when the gauge field and the gauge variation are independent of y, and (4.2) is the contribution of the localized fermion. The other is that the anomaly of the localized fermion at y = 0 is canceled by the contribution from the CS-term, but the variation of the CS-term also produces the same amount of anomaly at y = ±, which gives (4.2). We will make more comments on the relation to the anomaly inflow below.
Let us next discuss the anomaly (D + 2)-form (3.58). Inserting (4.1) into (3.58), we obtain

I2r+3(A,

m)

=

 -2 i

f (x)  1

=

.

2

(4.9)

A possible choice of I20r+2 satisfying the relation ID+2 = dID0 +1 in (3.61) with D = 2r + 1 is

I20r+2(A, m) = f (m)I2r+2(A) .

(4.10)

Since this is invariant under the U (N ) transformation, we have vI20r+2(A, m) = 0 and the anomaly I21r+1 related to I20r+2 by the decent relation (3.61) vanishes. However, this does not mean the m dependent anomaly (D + 2)-form I2r+3(A, m) is useless. In

fact, we can extract the information of the anomaly from the fermions localized at the

interface from (4.8) as follows.

The

point

is

that

the

factor

(m)

in

(4.10)

but

approaches

±

1 2

sgn(u)

at y = ±. Therefore, the relation I2r+3 = dI20r+2 with a gauge invariant (2r + 2)-form

I20r+2 does not imply that I2r+3 is trivial as an element of cohomology with compact

support. To find the anomaly for the localized modes, we decompose I20r+2 in (4.10)

21

into a local part that vanishes at y  ± and a closed form that does not contribute in the relation I2r+3 = dI20r+2 as

I20r+2(A, m) = I20rl+oc2al(A, m) + d2r+1(A, m)

(4.11)

with

I20rl+oc2al(A, m)  -df (m)I20r+1(A) , 2r+1(A, m)  f (m)I20r+1(A) ,

(4.12)

where I20r+1(A) is the CS (2r + 1)-form satisfying I2r+2(A) = dI20r+1(A). We interpret I20rl+oc2al(A, m) as the part that gives the anomaly localized at the inter-
face. Integrating I20rl+oc2al(A, m) over the y direction, one obtains a CS (2r + 1)-form

I20rl+oc1al(A)  -

I20rl+oc2al(A, m) = sgn(u)I20r+1(A) ,

{y}

(4.13)

which is related to the anomaly I21rlocal(v, A) for the Weyl fermions localized at the interface by the descent relation vI20rl+oc1al(A) = dI21rlocal(v, A) in (3.61). Here, {y} denotes the integral over y. The anomaly (2r + 2)-form for the localized fermions is given by

I2lorc+a2l (A) 

I2r+3(A, m) = sgn(u)I2r+2(A) .

{y}

(4.14)

The second term in (4.11) corresponds to the anomaly contribution from the bulk that cancels the anomaly localized at the interface around y = 0 through the anomaly inflow [23]. To see this explicitly, it is convenient to take the |u|   limit, in which f (m) and df (m) approach a step function and a delta function 1-form with support at y = 0, respectively:

f (m)



1 2

sgn(u)

sgn(y)

,

df (m)  sgn(u)(y)dy .

(4.15)

Then, I20rl+oc2al(A, m) is completely localized at y = 0 and 2r+1 becomes

2r+1(A,

m)



-

1 2

sgn(m)I20r+1

(A)

,

(4.16)

which can be interpreted as the CS-term in the bulk induced from the path integral of

the massive fermions, which precisely cancels the anomaly localized at the interface.

4.1.2 Vortex (codimension 2 interface)
Next, consider a D = (2r + 2)-dimensional system (3.1) with a vortex-type mass profile given by

m = µ(z)1N = uz1N ,

(4.17)

22

where z = x2r+1 - ix2r+2 and u is a complex parameter. Here, we assume that the gauge fields as well as the parameter  are independent of z, and satisfy A+ = A-  A and A2r+1 = A2r+2 = 0, for simplicity.
Then, (3.50) implies

log J = -i (x) [ch(F )]2r .

(4.18)

This agrees with the anomaly of a 2r-dimensional system with Weyl fermions and it is interpreted as the anomaly contribution from the Weyl fermion localized on the interface at z = z = 0.
Again, we can explicitly find localized Weyl fermions as follows.[24, 25, 23] For this purpose, it is convenient to choose µ = (µ2r) (µ = 1, · · · , 2r + 1) and 2r+2 = -i12r , where (µ2r) (µ = 1, · · · , 2r) are gamma matrices in 2r-dimensions and (22rr+)1 is the chirality operator for them. In this case, the Dirac equation D = 0 can be written as

D/ (2r)+ + 2(P+z - P-z)+ + uz- = 0 , D/ (2r)- + 2(P+z - P-z)- + uz+ = 0 ,

(4.19) (4.20)

where

D/ (2r)

is

defined

in

(4.5)

and

P±



1 2

(12r

± (22rr+)1)

is

a

projection

operator

that

projects to positive/negative chirality spinors in 2r-dimensions. Then, we find a solution

localized around z = 0:

+(x,

z,

z)

=

-(x, z,

z)

=

e-

1 2

u|z|2

(2r)(x)

,

(4.21)

where we have assumed u to be real and positive without loss of generality, and (2r) is a positive chirality massless Weyl fermion in 2r-dimensions.23
The role of the anomaly (D + 2)-form (3.20) can be discussed in a similar way as the codimension 1 interface considered in section 4.1.1. For the mass profile (4.17), the anomaly (D + 2)-form (with D = 2r + 2) becomes

I2r+4(A, m) = df1(m) I2r+2(A) ,

(4.22)

where I2r+2(A)  -2i[ch(F )]2r+2 is the anomaly polynomial for a Weyl fermion in 2r-dimensions and f1 is a 1-form given by

f1(m)



i 4

1 - e-|m|2

d log m - d log m .

(4.23)

Note that f1 is non-vanishing at |z|  , while its derivative

df1(m)

=

i dmdm e-|m|2 2

(4.24)

23A negative chirality mode is obtained when the mass is m = uz 1N , which represents an anti-vortex.

23

decays exponentially as |z|  , and approaches a delta function 2-form with support at z = z = 0 in the u   limit. The integral of df1 over the z-plane is normalized as

df1 = 1 ,

(4.25)

The CS-form I20r+3(A, m) satisfying I2r+4(A, m) = dI20r+3(A, m) can be chosen as

I20r+3(A, m) = f1(m)I2r+2(A) = I20rl+oc3al(A, m) + d2r+2(A, m)

(4.26)

where

I20rl+oc3al(A, m)  df1(m)I20r+1(A) , 2r+2(A, m)  -f1(m)I20r+1(A) .

(4.27)

Here, I20r+1(A) is the CS-form satisfying I2r+2(A) = dI20r+1(A). The anomaly contribution of the fermions localized at the interface, denoted as
I21rlocal(A), is related to

I20rl+oc1al(A) 

I20rl+oc3al(A, m) = I20r+1(A) .

{z,z}

(4.28)

where {z,z} denotes the integral over the z-plane, by the descent relation dI21rlocal = vI20rl+oc1al. In other words, it is characterized by the anomaly polynomial

I2lorc+a2l (A) 

I2r+4(A, m) = I2r+2(A) .

{z,z}

(4.29)

On the other hand, 2r+2(A, m) gives the bulk contribution of the anomaly that cancels the anomaly on the interface.

4.1.3 Interfaces of higher codimension

The discussion in sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 can be generalized to the cases with interfaces of higher codimensions. We are interested in the interfaces with Weyl fermions on them.
A codimension n interface in D = (2r+n)-dimensional spacetime can be constructed by giving a mass of the form

n
m(x) = u I xI ,
I =1

(4.30)

where I (I = 1, 2, · · · , n) are matrices of size N = 2[(n-1)/2] related to n-dimensional gamma matrices I by

I = I (for odd n and D) , I =

I I

(for even n and D) . (4.31)

24

In this case, it can be shown that there is a Weyl fermion on the interface at x1 =

· · · = xn = 0 obtained as a localized fermion zero mode, as we have seen this explicitly

in sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 for n = 1, 2. We will give an indirect argument for this

fact for general n in connection to index theorems in section 4.3.2 and string theory

interpretation in section 5.

It is also possible to get k Weyl fermions by replacing I in (4.30) by 1k  I as

n
m(x) = u 1k  I xI .
I =1

(4.32)

In this case, the gauge group is U(kN ) or U(kN )+ × U(kN )- for odd or even D,

respectively, and the vector-like U(k) subgroup of the form g  1N with g  U(k) is unbroken. Then, k Weyl fermions coupled with U(k) gauge field a can be obtained by

setting U(kN) gauge field A as

A = a  1N .

(4.33)

It is straightforward to check that the anomaly for these Weyl fermions on the interface can be obtained by inserting the mass profile (4.32) and the gauge field (4.33) into our formulas (3.20)­(3.22) and (3.58)­(3.60). In particular, the expressions (4.14) and (4.29) of the anomaly (2r + 2)-form for the localized fermions are generalized as

I2lorc+a2l (a)  I2r+n+2(A, m) , n

(4.34)

where n denotes the integral over xI (I = 1, 2, · · · , n). This agrees with the anomaly polynomial for 2r-dimensional Weyl fermions coupled to the U(k) gauge field a.

As discussed in [4, 21], the anomaly contributions from fermion zero modes localized

on the interfaces implies that there is at least one point in the space of parameters of

the theory, called a diabolical point, at which the theory is not trivially gapped. In our

examples, it is of course clear that the massless point m = 0 is the diabolical point.

However, since the anomaly takes a discrete value, the existence of the diabolical point

is robust against continuous deformations of the theory. In fact, as we have seen, the

anomaly depends only on the asymptotic behavior of the mass profile. The existence of

the diabolical point can be shown without examining the theory at the massless point.

This point is more explicit in the Callias-type index theorem (4.74) discussed in section

4.3.2.

4.2 Anomaly in spacetime with boundaries
Since the fermions cannot propagate in a region with infinite mass, it is possible to realize a spacetime with boundaries by considering a spacetime dependent mass that
25

blows up in some regions. In this subsection, we discuss the anomaly driven by the boundary condition imposed on the fermions, using our formulas obtained in section 3.

4.2.1 Odd dimensional cases

Let us first consider a D = (2r + 1)-dimensional system of N Dirac fermions with

y  x2r+1 dependent mass given by

  (m0 + u(y - L))1N (L < y)

m(y) = µ(y)1N = 

m01N (m0 + uy)1N

(0  y  L) , (y < 0)

(4.35)

where u, u and m0 are real parameters.24 We assume that the gauge field is independent of y in the y < 0 and L < y regions,
When |u| and |u| are large enough, this system can be regarded as that of N Dirac fermions with mass m0 living in an interval 0  y  L with boundaries at y = 0 and y = L. The boundary conditions for the fermion fields follow from the requirement that they do not blow up at y  ±. The discussion around (4.4)­(4.7) implies that the corresponding boundary conditions are

2r+1 - sgn(u) |y=0 = 0 , 2r+1 - sgn(u) |y=L = 0 ,

(4.36)

which are equivalent to one of the boundary conditions considered in [26]. In this setup, the formula (3.70) implies that the Jacobian is

log J = i-

 [ch(F )]2r + i+

 [ch(F )]2r ,

y=0

y=L

(4.37)

with

-

=

1 2

sgn(u)

+

f (m0)

,

+

=

1 sgn(u) 2

-

f (m0)

(4.38)

where m0  m0/ and f (z) is the function defined in (4.9). When the cut-off  is sent to infinity, while keeping m0 finite, f (m0) simply vanishes and we get

-

=

1 2

sgn(u)

,

+

=

1 2

sgn(u)

.

(4.39)

Note that each term in (4.37) with (4.39) is proportional to the anomaly contribution from a Weyl fermion in 2r-dimensions. However, since the coefficients ± are not

24Strictly speaking, since y2m has delta function singularities at y = 0, L, the assumption that we made above (3.44) is not satisfied. However, it can be shown that these singularities do not contribute and the result is unchanged. Alternatively, one could replace µ(y) with a smooth function with the same asymptotic behavior as (4.35), which also gives the same result.

26

integers, it is not possible to interpret this result as the contribution from the Weyl fermions localized at the boundaries. This is because the wave function of the fermions are not completely localized at the boundary in our setup, unless we take the |m0|   limit. On the other hand, ± can be shifted as ±  ± ±  by adding a local counterterm of the form

Sc.t. =  V [ch(F )]2r

(4.40)

where V is the U(1) gauge field, and including its gauge variation in the Jacobian

(4.37).

Therefore,

only

the

combination

+ + -

=

1 2

(sgn(u)

+

sgn(u))

is

free

from

this

ambiguity.

It is nonetheless useful to find the anomaly contribution of the localized fermionic

zero modes. Assuming that m0 is very large and the y-dependence of the gauge field is negligible, the solutions of the Dirac equation (4.4) in the region 0  y < L are

approximately a linear combination of exponentially increasing and decreasing modes

as

(x, y)  e-m0y+(2r)(x) + em0y-(2r)(x) , where ±(2r) satisfies
D/ (2r)±(2r) = 0 , 2r+1±(2r) = ±±(2r) .

(4.41) (4.42)

Then, the boundary conditions (4.36) imply that there are Weyl fermions localized near the boundary with chirality sgn(u) and sgn(u) localized around y = 0 and y = L, if sgn(m0) = sgn(u) and sgn(m0) = -sgn(u), respectively. The anomaly contribution of these localized modes is obtained by formally taking the limit |m0|   in (4.38),25 in which we have

-

=

1 2

(sgn(u)

+

sgn(m0))

,

+

=

1 2

(sgn(u)

-

sgn(m0))

.

(4.43)

4.2.2 Even dimensional cases

In this subsection, we consider a D = 2r-dimensional spacetime with boundaries real-

ized by the mass profile

  u(y - L)g(x) (L < y)

m(x) = µ(y)g(x) = 

0 uyg(x)

(0  y  L) , (y < 0)

(4.44)

25In this limit, only the localized zero modes are expected to contribute, since the modes with energy greater than  are suppressed by the heat kernel regularization (3.37).

27

where y  x2r, g(x)  U (N ) and u, u  C. Since the phases of u and u can be absorbed in g(x), we assume u, u > 0 without loss of generality. We take a gauge with A+y = A-y = 0 and assume that the gauge fields (A+, A-) and g(x) are independent of y in the y  0 and L  y regions. Since µ(y) vanishes in the region 0 < y < L, the g(x) dependence in this region drops out. Therefore, we can choose g(x) to be discontinuous in the region  < y < L -  with 0 <   L, and the configuration of g(x) at y = 0 and y = L can be topologically different.
As discussed around (4.36) for the odd dimensional case, by the requirement that the fermion fields do not blow up at y  ±, the boundary conditions corresponding to the mass profile (4.44) are obtained as

2rg - g |y=0,L = 0 ,

(4.45)

where g 

g 1

=

g+ -

.26

Therefore, this system can be regarded as that of

massless N Dirac fermions on the interval 0  y  L with a boundary condition (4.45).

Note that this boundary condition (4.45) depends on the spacetime coordinates through

g(x). With fixed g(x), the boundary condition (4.45) breaks the U(N )+ × U(N )-

gauge symmetry down to the U(N ) subgroup that consists of elements (U+, U-)  U (N )+ × U (N )- with U- = gU+g-1. However, as it is evident from our construction,

the boundary condition (4.45) is invariant under the gauge transformation

A+  AU++ , A-  AU-- , g  U- g U+-1 ,

(4.46)

and it makes sense to consider the anomaly with respect to U(N )+ × U(N )- even at the boundaries.
For this configuration, the field strength of the superconnection (3.23) becomes

F= =

g-1 1N
g-1 1N

F+g - µ21N

i(dµ1N - (A- - Ag+)µ)

(4.47)

where µ  µ/, Ag+  gA+g-1 + gdg-1 and F+g  gF+g-1. The second line of (4.47) is

written in the notation introduced in (2.1) with 1 =

and 2 =

0 -i i0

.

Then, we

obtain

Str(eF ) = e-µ2 Str eF+g e++F-e-+µ(A--Ag+)2 (1 + idµ1) ,

(4.48)

26The boundary condition of this type with g = 1 is considered in [26].

One can show that this a generalization of CS-forms satisfying

d|y=0,L = (ch(F-) - ch(F+)) |y=0,L ,

(4.53)

and it is manifestly invariant under the gauge transformation (4.46). To show (4.53), consider the L  y region and note that  at y = L can be written as

|y=L =

ch(eF ) ,

{Ly}

(4.54)

where the integration is over y with L  y. Then, applying the exterior derivative

d = dx + dy, where dx

and

and

using

d|y=L =

dxch(eF ) = -

dych(eF ) = -ch(eF )|y=L ,

{Ly}

{Ly}

(4.55)

which implies (4.53). An important observation is that even if the gauge fields are set to zero, (4.50) can
be non-vanishing. In fact, for A+ = A- = 0, we obtain

[]2r-1 =

-i 2

r

(r - 1)! (2r - 1)!

Tr((gdg

-1)2r-1)

.

(4.56)

When the spacetime is of the form S2r-1 ×{y}, the integral of this form over S2r-1 gives a winding number in 2r-1(U (N )) represented by the map g : S2r-1  U (N ). If the

29

winding number at y = 0 and y = L are the same, a function g : S2r-1 × {y}  U (N ) that interpolates the configuration of g at y = 0 and y = L can be found and the Jacobian (4.49) can be canceled by the gauge variation of a local counterterm

Sc.t. = -

V []2r-1 ,

0<y<L

(4.57)

where V is the U (1)V gauge field and []2r-1 is given by (4.56). However, when the winding numbers at y = 0 and y = L are different, this is not allowed and there is an anomaly.
Another interesting situation is the case with g(x) = ei(x)1N and A  A+ = A-. In this case, the formula (4.50) implies



=

-

d 2

ch(F

)

.

(4.58)

Therefore, when the spacetime is of the form S1×S2r-2×{y} and the winding number of ei on S1 for y = 0 and y = L are different, there is an anomaly for the U(1)V symmetry in the presence of a non-vanishing background vector-like gauge field on S2r-2.

4.3 Index theorems
From (3.29) and the first expression in (3.37), we find that the integral of I(x) gives the index of operator D:

dDx I(x) = n - n = dim ker D - dim ker D  Ind(D) ,

(4.59)

and the result (3.46) implies an index theorem written in terms of the superconnection:27

Ind(D) = [ch(F )]D .

(4.60)

When we set m = 0 and A- = 0 in an even dimensional case, this formula reduces to a more familiar form of the Atiyah-Singer (AS) index theorem: Ind(D/ ) = ch(F+). Thus, (4.60) is a generalization of the AS index theorem, which includes spacetime dependent mass and is supposed to hold even when the spacetime manifold is odd dimensional and/or non-compact, provided that the spectra of DD and DD are discrete.
Here, we discuss some of the implications of this formula. We will not try to make the statements mathematically rigorous. Nevertheless, we hope they are useful and worth mentioning.
27A quick way to get the expression of the index from the results of the Jacobian in the previous sections is to set  = i in log J as Ind(D) = log J |=i.

4.3.1 Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem

The Atiyah-Patodi-Singer (APS) index theorem [27] is an index theorem for a Dirac operator on an even dimensional manifold N with boundary, stated as

Ind(D/ ) =

ch(F )A(R)

-

1 2

(H

)

,

(4.61)

where D/ is a Dirac operator on N, (H) is the eta invariant of a Dirac operator on the boundary denoted as H (see (4.65)).28
In this subsection, we first generalize (4.61) to include the spacetime dependent mass m and then apply it to the system considered in section 4.2.2. Let us consider a system in section 3.1 with D = 2r-dimensional spacetime of the form N = M × I, where M is a (2r - 1)-dimensional manifold with coordinates xµ (µ = 1, 2, · · · , 2r - 1) and I = [y-, y+]  R is an interval parameterized by y  x2r  I. For simplicity, as in the previous sections, we assume M to be flat and the A-genus is omitted.
It is convenient to choose µ in (3.3) such that 2r = 12r-1 and µ = iµ (µ = 1, 2, · · · , 2r - 1) with µ being the (2r - 1)-dimensional gamma matrices. Then the operator D defined in (3.3) and its conjugate D can be written as

D = y + Hy , D = -y + Hy ,

(4.62)

in the A+y = A-y = 0 gauge, where

Hy 

-iD/ (+2r-1)

m

iD/ (-2r-1)

,

(4.63)

2r-1

D/ (+2r-1) =

µ(µ + A+µ) ,

µ=1

2r-1

D/ (-2r-1) =

µ(µ + A-µ) .

µ=1

(4.64)

Note that although Hy is y-dependent, it does not contain the derivative with respect to y and it can be regarded as a Hermitian operator acting on spinors on M. Here, the mass m can depend on both xµ and y. When M is non-compact, the mass should diverge at infinity, as the examples considered in sections 4.1 and 4.2, so that Hy has a discrete spectrum.
The eta invariant of a Hermitian operator H is defined as

(H)  lim (s, H) , s0

(s, H)



2 ((s + 1)/2)


dt ts TrH

H e-t2H2

,

(4.65)

28See [28, 29, 30] for recent physicists-friendly formulations and derivations. See also [31] and Appendix A.

31

where the trace TrH is over the Hilbert space H on which the operator H is acting and s  0 limit is taken after analytic continuation of (s, H) on the complex s-plane. [27] (s, H) can be written as a sum over eigenvalues  of H as

(s, H) = sgn()||-s .


(4.66)

Here and in the following, we assume that H does not have a zero eigenvalue, whenever
it is used in (H) or (s, H). For the massless case, the eta invariant of Hy reduces to the difference of the eta invariant of the Dirac operators iD/ (+2r-1) and iD/ (-2r-1) as

(Hy)|m=0 = -(iD/ (+2r-1)) + (iD/ (-2r-1))

(4.67)

Then, as it is explained in Appendix A, the index of D is given by

Ind(D|I) =

[ch(F )]2r
y-<y<y+

+

1 2

[ (Hy )]yy==yy+-

,

(4.68)

where F is the field strength of the superconnection (3.23) with    taken after the integration, [f (y)]yy==yy+-  f (y+) - f (y-) and Ind(D|I) denotes the index of the operator D acting on spinors on M × I with the following APS boundary conditions. For the operator D, when the wave function at y = y± is expanded with respect to eigenfunctions of Hy±, the components with the negative (for y = y+) or positive (for y = y-) eigenvalues of Hy± have to vanish. The conditions for the operator D are the same as D with the replacement Hy±  -Hy±. These boundary conditions follow from the requirement that wave function of the fermion does not blow up at y  ±, when the system is extended to the y < y- and y+ < y regions with a y-independent configuration for y  y- and y+  y. (See Appendix A.)
Let us apply (4.68) to the system considered in section 4.2.2. Using (4.67), the formula (4.68) with [y-, y+] = [0, L] becomes

Ind(D|[0,L]) =

0<y<L

ch(F-)]2r

(iD/ (+2r-1)) - (iD/ (-2r-1))

, (4.69)

which is the APS index theorem for the massless Dirac operator defined by D|m=0 with the APS boundary conditions. On the other hand, for [y-, y+] = [-, +], (4.60) can be used, and from (4.49), we obtain

Ind(D) =

[ch(F+) - ch(F-)]2r +

[]2r-1 -

[]2r-1 .

0<y<L

y=L

y=0

(4.70)

This is interpreted as the index theorem for the massless fermions in the interval [0, L] with the boundary condition given by (4.45).

32

The difference between (4.69) and (4.70) can be evaluated by applying (4.68) to the

cases with [y-, y+] = [L, +] and [-, 0]:

Ind(D|[L,+]) =

[]2r-1

1 2

(iD/ (+2r-1)) - (iD/ (-2r-1))

(4.71)

where we have used limy± (Hy) = 0. In particular, it implies a well-known relation between eta invariant of a Dirac operator and the CS-form  defined by (4.50):

[]2r-1

=

1 2

(iD/ (-2r-1)) - (iD/ (+2r-1))

(mod Z) .

(4.72)

4.3.2 Callias-type index theorem

To illustrate the importance of the mass parameter (or the Higgs field) in the formula (4.60), let us consider the case where the gauge fields are turned off. The spacetime manifold is chosen to be a D-dimensional plane RD, where D can be either even or odd. In order to have discrete spectrum, we assume that the mass diverges at infinity. To be specific, the asymptotic behavior of the mass is assumed to be as

m  rg(x) (as r  ) ,

(4.73)

where r = xµxµ is the radial coordinate of RD and g(x)  U(N ) is a unitary matrix that only depends on the angular coordinates of RD. For odd D, g(x) is also required

to be Hermitian.29

Then, the right hand side of (4.60) can be easily evaluated by using (2.8). The result

is Ind(D) =

  ch(F ) = 

-i

where SD-1 is the sphere at r  . The former (even D case) is the same as the integral of (4.56) over SD-1 and the latter (odd D case) agrees with expression of the index for Callias's index theorem.[32]
29Here, we assume g(x) to be unitary for computational simplicity. However, this condition can be relaxed to g(x)  GL(N, C), as an invertible matrix (or invertible Hermitian matrix) can be continuously deformed to a unitary matrix (or unitary Hermitian matrix, respectively), keeping the invertibility.

33

We can apply these formulas for the configuration given by (4.30), in which g(x) is given by

5 Relation to string theory

Many of our results have natural interpretation in string theory. In fact, it is well-known that the CS-terms for unstable D-brane systems (D-brane - anti-D-brane systems and non-BPS D-branes) can be written by using superconnections30 [7, 8, 9, 10] as

SCDS9 = C ch(F ) ,

(5.1)

where C is a formal sum of Ramond-Ramond (RR) n-form fields (n is even or odd for type IIA or type IIB string theory, respectively.) and F is the field strength of the superconnection for the gauge field and tachyon field on them,31 and it is natural to anticipate the appearance of the superconnection in anomaly analysis of quantum field theory counterparts.
An easy way to realize even dimensional systems having fermions with manifest chiral symmetry is to consider a Dp-brane (p = -1, 1, 3, 5, 7) with D9-branes and D9-branes in type IIB string theory.[34]32 On the Dp-brane world-volume, (p + 1)-dimensional fermions are obtained in the spectrum of p-9 strings and p-9 strings. Here, a p-p string is an open string stretched between a Dp-brane and a Dp-brane, and p corresponds to a Dp-brane. It can be shown that p-9 strings and p-9 strings create positive and negative chirality Weyl fermions, respectively. When we have N D9-D9 pairs, there are N flavors of fermions and the U(N)×U(N) gauge symmetry associated with the D9-D9 pairs corresponds to the U(N )+ × U(N )- chiral symmetry for the (p + 1)-dimensional system realized on the Dp-brane. The CS-term of the D9-D9 system is written as (5.1) with F being the field strength of the superconnection of the even type (2.3), in which
30As in the previous sections, we omit the terms with curvature represented by the A-genus. 31See [33] for a generalization. 32A T-dual version (Nc D4-branes with Nf D8-D8 pairs) is used in [35] to realize QCD in string theory.

34

A+ and A- are the U(N ) × U(N ) gauge fields given by 9-9 strings and 9-9 strings, respectively, and T is the tachyon field obtained by 9-9 strings. The tachyon field T is in the bifundamental representation of the U(N) × U(N) symmetry. It couples with the fermions with Yukawa interaction and the value of the tachyon field plays the role of the mass of the fermions. When |T |  , the fermions decouple, which correspond to the annihilation of the D9-D9 pairs.
Similarly, odd dimensional systems with N Dirac fermions can be obtained by placing a Dp-brane (p = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8) with N non BPS D9-branes in type IIA string theory. In this case, the CS-term for the non-BPS D9-branes is given by (5.1), where F is the odd type given by (2.13). Here, A and T in F are the U(N) gauge field and the tachyon field, respectively, on the non-BPS D9-branes. The tachyon field T is a Hermitian matrix of size N and transforms as the adjoint representation of the U(N) symmetry. There are N Dirac fermions in the spectrum of p-9 strings, which are in the fundamental representation of U(N), and the value of the tachyon field corresponds to the mass of the fermions.
Although the CS-term (5.1) for the unstable D-brane system was originally derived by the computation of the interaction with the RR fields, it can be determined by the requirement of the anomaly cancellation as argued in [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. For the brane configuration above, the standard argument shows that the anomaly contribution from the CS-term for the unstable D9-branes (5.1) and the Dp-brane

SCDSp = C ch(f ) , M

(5.2)

where M is the D = p+1-dimensional Dp-brane world-volume and ch(f ) = exp

i 2

f

is

the Chern character for the U(1) gauge field on it, is given by the anomaly (D + 2)-form

of the form33

2i [ch(F )ch(f )]D+2 .

(5.3)

Note that (5.3) can be written as 2i [ch(F )]D+2 by absorbing the U(1) gauge field on the Dp-brane into the U(1)V part of the gauge field of the unstable D9-brane system. This contribution is supposed to cancel the anomaly contribution from the fermions, which is indeed the case with our proposal (3.20) and (3.58), provided that the tachyon field is identified with the mass as T = m. From the dimensional analysis, the cut-off  is of the order of the string scale, though the precise relation between  and the string length ls is not clear.
33To be more precise, we should consider an anomaly 12-form of the form 2i [ch(F )ch(f )9-p]12, where 9-p is a delta function (9 - p)-form supported on M .

35

The argument above suggests that the anomaly is characterized by the anomaly (D + 2)-form written in terms of the Chern character of the superconnection. However, as discussed in section 4.1.1 and 4.1.2, since the T dependent part of the anomaly (D + 2)-form drops out in the naive use of the anomaly descent relation, it is important to have more evidence for this statement. To this end, let us show that the analysis in section 4.1 is consistent with the D-brane descent relation [42, 43, 44].34
It is known that a Dq-brane (q is even/odd for type IIA/IIB) localized at xI = 0 (I = 1, 2, · · · , 9 - q) can be realized as a soliton in the unstable D9-brane system by choosing the tachyon field as in (4.30) with n  9 - q and u  . [43, 44] In fact, the tachyon configuration with (4.30) is related to the generator of K-groups K(Rn)  Z or K1(Rn)  Z for even or odd n, respectively, given by the Atiyah-Bott-Shapiro construction [47], and these K-groups correspond to the Dq-brane charge. When we have the Dp-brane extended along xµ = 0 (µ = 0, 1, · · · , p) with 9-q  p, the Dq-brane corresponds to the codimension (9 - q) interface considered in section 4.1.3. (q = 8 and q = 7 correspond to the kink and vortex considered in sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2, respectively.)
For this intersecting Dp-Dq system, it can be shown that there is a Weyl fermion localized at the (p + q - 8)-dimensional intersection in the spectrum of p-q strings, obtained by quantization of the open string. This is consistent with the analysis of the localized fermionic zero modes in section 4.1.
Furthermore, we can obtain k Dq-branes with U(k) gauge field a on them by choosing the tachyon and gauge fields as (4.32) and (4.33). Then, one can show that the CSterm for the Dq-brane is reproduced from (5.1) by inserting (4.32) and (4.33) into (5.1) and integrating over the transverse space [48] (see also [46]), which corresponds to the procedure in (4.34). As the anomaly contribution from the CS-terms for the Dp-brane and Dq-branes precisely cancels that of the Weyl fermions created by the p-q strings, the anomaly polynomial for these Weyl fermions is given by (4.34), which is completely parallel to the discussion in section 4.1 for the localized fermionic zero modes.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we have investigated the anomaly of fermions with spacetime dependent mass. It was found in section 3 that the U(1)V anomaly and the anomaly (D + 2)-form are written with the Chern character of the superconnection in both even and odd dimensional cases as (3.58), (3.60), (3.58) and (3.60). Applications of these formulas

were discussed in section 4. In section 4.1, we considered the interfaces made by the spacetime dependent mass on which Weyl fermions are localized and confirmed that our formulas can be used to extract the anomaly of these Weyl fermions. The boundaries of spacetime realized by making the mass large in some regions were studied in section 4.2. A notable example was a system with the spacetime dependent boundary conditions (4.45) considered in section 4.2.2. It was found that there are contributions to the anomaly from the boundaries, even when the gauge fields are turned off. Implications to the index theorems were discussed in section 4.3, in which the AS and APS index theorems for the operator D defined in (3.3) and (3.56) were given, and the application to the Callias-type index theorems was briefly described. Finally, in section 5, we pointed out that the system of fermions with spacetime dependent mass can be realized in string theory and our formulas of anomaly are consistent with the anomaly cancellation via the anomaly inflow from the CS-term of the unstable D9-brane systems.

A The APS index theorem

In this appendix, we give a heuristic derivation of (4.68) following the argument given in the appendix of [31]. The setup is the same as that of section 4.3.1. As mentioned below (4.68), we extend the system to - < y < + by choosing a y-independent configuration in the regions y  y- and y+  y.
First, we derive one of the key relations:

where k = k2r/. As we did around (3.42), we expand the right hand side with respect to 1/ regarding k and Hy/ to be of O(1). The leading term in the 1/ expansion gives (A.1).
On the other hand, (4.65) implies

which can be used when Hy does not have a zero eigenvalue. Let us assume that Hy has zero eigenvalues at finite values of y denoted as yi
(i = 1, 2, · · · , k) with y- < y1 < y2 < · · · < yk < y+. From the expression in (4.66), we see that the value of (Hy) jumps by +2 or -2 at y = yi when one of the eigenvalues of Hy crosses zero from below or above, respectively, while increasing y from y = yi -  to y = yi +  with a positive small parameter 0 <   1. It is known that the index of

38

the operator D is equal to a half of the sum over these jumps [27]: 35

(A.7)

Here, the boundary conditions for the fermions are such that the wave function does not blow up at y  ±. In these regions, the Dirac equation D = 0 with (4.62) can be solved by

 = e-±y± ,

(A.8)

where ± is an eigenfunction of Hy± with the eigenvalue ±. Therefore, the modes with + < 0 and - > 0 are discarded, which gives the APS boundary conditions.

35This fact can be easily understood in the adiabatic limit,[49, 50, 51]: in which Hy is slowly varying with respect to y. In such cases, the Dirac equation D = 0 has an approximate solution of the form  = e- y dy , where  is an eigenfunction of Hy with eigenvalue (y). This solution is normalizable when  > 0 and  < 0 as y  + and y  -, respectively. Similarly, a normalizable approximate solution of D = 0 is given by  = e+ y dy  with  < 0 and  > 0 as y  + and y  -, respectively. Therefore, the index is given by the difference of the number of eigenvalues that cross zero from below and above when y is increased from y- to y+.
