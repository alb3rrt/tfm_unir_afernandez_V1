SOME EXAMPLES OF SILTED ALGEBRAS OF DYNKIN TYPE
RUO-YUN XING
Abstract. This paper studies silted algebras, namely, endomorphism algebras of 2-term silting complexes, over path algebras of Dynkin quivers. We will describe an algorithm to produce all basic 2-term silting complexes over the path algebra of a Dynkin quiver, and use this algorithm to compute some examples.
1. Introduction
Silting theory plays an important role in representation theory because it is closely related to many research fields, such as t-structures ([11][12][10]), cluster-tilting theory ([4]), and tilting theory ([1][2][6]). Silted algebras are defined as endomorphism algebras of 2-term silting complexes over hereditary algebras ([5]). According to a remarkable result of Buan and Zhou ([5]), if A is a silted algebra, then A either is a tilted algebra, or A is a strictly shod algebra, that is, A has global dimension 3 and any A-module has projective or injective dimension no greater than 1.
In this paper, a complete list of silted algebras is given for path algebras of certain Dynkin quivers. The main result is as follows:
(1) there is 1 silted algebra of the quiver :  (tilted algebra of type A1) (2) there are 2 silted algebras of the quiver   :    (tilted algebra of type A2) and   (tilted algebra of type A1  A1) (3) there are 5 silted algebras of the quiver  -  - , forming two families:
(i) tilted algebras of type A3:  -  - ,  -  - ,  -  - ,  /  / 
(ii) tilted algebra of type A2  A1:  -   (4) there are 15 silted algebras of the quiver  -  -  - , forming 3 families:
(i) tilted algebras of type A4, for details see Example 3.7 (I); (ii) tilted algebras of type A3  A1:
 / /, o  /,  /o ,  / /  (iii) tilted algebras of type A2  A2:  /   /  (5) there are 13 silted algebras of the quiver

 For a brief summary, all of these type A silted algebras are tilted algebras, all but one of these type D4 silted algebras are tilted algebras, and all but four of these type D5 silted algebras are tilted algebras. Therefore, from these examples we obtain five strictly shod algebras (s1) - (s5).

In order to classify these silted algabras, we first classify the 2-term silting complexes. For this purpose, we develop an algorithm (Algorithm 3.1) based on the algorithm of Happel and Ringel classifying tilting modules. Given a Dynkin quiver Q, we can produce all the 2-term silting complexes by using this algorithm. Then we calculate the endomorphism algebra of each 2-term silting complex. For types A3, A4 and D4, we actually classify silted algebras for all orientations, but we do not find strictly shod algebras except in (5) and (6) above.
The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we recall the definitions of tilting modules, tilted algebras, 2-term silting complexes and silted algebras. In Section 3, we describe the algorithm producing all 2-term silting complexes and calculate the concrete examples.
Throughout this paper, K denotes an algebraically closed field and D = HomK(-, K) denotes the K-dual. All algebras will be finite-dimensional K-algebras, and all modules will be finite-dimensional right modules. Acknowledgement: This paper is based on the master thesis of the author.

2. Silted algebras
In this section, we recall the definitions of tilting modules, tilted algebras, 2-term silting complexes and silted algebras.
2.1 Tilted algebras.
Definition 2.1. [3, Chapter 6 Definition 2.1 and Chapter 6 Corollary 4.4] Let A be an algebra. An A-module T is called a tilting module if the following three conditions are satisfied:
(T1) pdTA  1. (T2) Ext1A(T, T ) = 0. (T3) |T | = |A|.
Definition 2.2. [3, Chapter 8 Definition 3.1] Let Q be an acyclic quiver. An algebra B is said to be tilted of type Q if there exists a tilting module T over the path algebra A = KQ of Q such that B = End(TA).
The global dimension of a tilted algebra is at most 2 [7, Proposition 3.2]. Let Q be a Dynkin quiver and A = KQ. In this case the condition (T1) is automatic and both AA and D(AA) are tilting modules with endomorphism algebra A. According to the proof of [9, Proposition 2.1] by Happel and Ringel, we obtain the following algorithm to produce all basic tilting modules over A.

Algorithm 2.3. Perform the following 3 steps for all non-empty subsets I of Q0. (1) Let e = e(i), P (I) = eA, A(I) = A/ e .
iI
(2) For each basic tilting A(I)-module N which, considered as an A-module, has no non-trivial injective direct summands, form the A-module M = P (I)  A-1NA.
(3) For each A-module M obtained in (2), let m  N  {0} be such that |A-mM| = |A|, and A-mM has non-trivial injective direct summand. Form the A-modules A-pM, 0  p  m.
Example 2.4. Let A the path algebra of the quiver 1-2. Then the AR-quiver (modA) of modA is of the form

? 1 1 

01

10

We apply Algorithm 2.3. (1) I = {1}. The quiver of A(I) = A/ e has only one vertex 2. So modA(I) has only one tilting module MA = 0 1 . This yields the tilting module
TA = P (I)  A-1(MA) = P (1)  A-1( 0 1 ) = D(AA) = 1 1  1 0 .

и и

(2) I = {2}. The quiver of A(I) = A/ e has only one vertex 1. So modA(I) has only one tilting module MA = 1 0 , which is injective.
(3) I = {1, 2}. In this case the tilting module is

TA = P (I) = P (1)  P (2) = AA = 1 1  0 1 .

и и

To summarise, A has two basic tilting modules : 1 1  1 0 and 1 1  0 1 . Both endomorphism algebras are isomorphism to A.
2.2 2-term silting complexes.
Definition 2.5. [5, Page 1] Let A be an algebra. Let P be a complex in the bounded homotopy category of finitely generated projective A-modules Kb(projA). Then P is called silting if HomKb(projA)(P, P[i]) = 0 for i > 0, and if P generates Kb(projA) as a triangulated category. Furthermore, we say that P is 2-term if P only has non-zero terms in degrees 0 and -1.

5
The following result is a corollary of [2, Theorem 3.2].
Corollary 2.6. Assume that A is hereditary. Then any basic 2-term silting complex over A is of the form M  P [1], where P = eA for some idempotent e of A, and M is a basic tilting module over A/ e . Conversely, every complex of this form is a 2-term silting complex.
2.3 Silted algebras.
Definition 2.7. [5, Definition 0.1] Let Q be an acyclic quiver. We call an algebra B silted of type Q if there exists a 2-term silting complex M over KQ such that B = EndKb(projKQ)(M ).
Tilted algebras are silted algebras, because (projective resolutions of) tilting modules are 2-term silting complexes.
Theorem 2.8. [5, Theorem 2.13] Let A be a connected algebra. Then the following are equivalent:
(a) A is a silted algebra; (b) A is a tilted algebra or a strictly shod algebra.
Recall from [8, page 2] that an algebra A is called shod (for small homological dimension) provided for each indecomposable A-module X, either pdXA  1 or idXA  1. It is known that gl.dimA  3 [7, Proposition 2.2]. We call A strictly shod if it is shod and gl.dimA = 3. It is known that tilted algebras are shod [7, Proposition 3.2].
The following lemma will be useful.
Lemma 2.9. An algebra A is silted of type Q if and only if Aop is silted of type Qop.
Proof. This is because RHomA(?, A)[1] : Kb(projA) - Kb(projAop) is a triangle anti-equivalence and induces a bijection between the set of 2-term silting complexes over KQ and that over KQop.
3. Examples of silted algebras of Dynkin type
In this section, we will describe an algorithm to produce all basic 2-term silting complexes over the path algebra of a Dynkin quiver, and use this algorithm to compute some examples.
Let Q be a Dynkin quiver and A = KQ. Let K[-1.0](projA) be the full subcategory of Kb(projA) consisting of complexes concentrated in degrees -1 and 0. We will call the full subquiver of the AR quiver of Kb(projA) whose vertices belong to K[-1.0](projA) the AR quiver of K[-1.0](projA). It is obtained from the AR quiver of modA by properly gluing a copy of Q from the right.

3.1 The algorithm. Let Q be a Dynkin quiver, and A = KQ. Due to Corollary 2.6 we have the
following algorithm to produce all basic 2-term silting complexes over A.
Algorithm 3.1. We perform the following two steps for any subset I of Q0: (1) Let e = e(i) and A(I) = A/ e .
iI
(2) For each basic tilting A(I)-module M produced by Algorithm 2.3, form T = M  P [1] where P = eA.
Observation 3.2. Let T = M  P [1] be a 2-term silting complex over A, where P  projA and M  modA. If P = 0 or M has no non-trivial projective direct summands, then End(T ) is a tilted algebra of type Q.
Indeed, if P = 0, then T = M is a tilting A-module; if M has no no-trivial projective direct summands, then A(T ) belongs to modA, and hence is a tilting Amodule, so End(T ) = End(A(T )) is a tilted algebra.
By Observation 3.2, we will divide silted algebras of type Q into two classes:
(I) tilted algebras of type Q, (II) End(T ), where T = M  P [1] is a 2-term silting complex such that P = 0
and M has a non-zero projective direct summand over A. In other words, T has direct summands both on the left border and on the right border of the AR quiver of K[-1.0](projA).
We remark that (I) and (II) may have overlaps. We are mainly interested in the silted algebras which are not tilted of type Q, especially the strictly shod algebras.

3.2 Examples of type A.

3.2.1 Type A1.
Example 3.3. Let A be the path algebra of the quiver 1. For a 2-term silting complex M  P [1], either P = 0, or M = 0. So EndKb(projA)(M  P [1]) is isomorphic to A.
3.2.2 Type A2.
Example 3.4. Let A be the path algebra of the quiver 1 -2
Tilted algebras were already computed in Example 2.4. Thus below we apply Algorithm 3.1 to all non-empty subsets I of Q0.

3.3.1 Type D4. According to [13, Theorem 1], there are 50 basic 2-term silting complexes, 20 of
which are tilting modules. Up to isomorphism there are four quivers of type D4. Due to Lemma 2.9, we classify silted algebras for two of them.
