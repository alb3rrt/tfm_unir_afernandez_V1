DENSITY QUESTIONS ON ARITHMETIC EQUIVALENCE

GUILLERMO MANTILLA-SOLER

Abstract. It is a classic result that two number fields have equal Dedekind zeta func-

tions if and only if the arithmetic type of a prime p is the same in both fields for almost

all prime p. Here, almost all means with the possible exception of a set of Dirichlet

density zero. One of the results of this paper shows that the condition density zero can

be improved to a specific positive density that depends solely in the degree of the fields.

More specifically, for every positive n we exhibit a positive constan cn such that any two

degree n number fields K and L are arithmetically equivalent if and only if the set of

primes p such that the arithmetic type of p in K and L is not the same has Dirichlet

density at

most

cn.

We in

that cn

works and

give a

heuristic

evidence

that

points

to

the

fact

that

this

value

might

be

improved

to

2 n2

.

We also show that

to check whether or not two number fields are arithmetically equivalent it is enough to

check equality between finitely many coefficients of their zeta functions, and we give an

upper bound for such number.

1. Introduction and statement of results
Two number fields are called Arithmetically equivalent if they have the same Dedekind zeta function. Arithmetically equivalence is as strong relation between number fields, for instance any two A.E fields have the same discriminant, unit group, signature, Galois closure, the product of class number times regulator and others (see [4] or [2, §2].) A well known characterization for arithmetic equivalence can be given in terms of residue class degrees of rational primes.
Definition 1.1. The arithmetic type of a rational prime  in K is the ordered tuple A(K) := (f1, . . . , fg) where f1  · · ·  fg are the residue class degrees of  in K.
Theorem 1.2 (Perlis [4]). Let K and L be number fields. The following are equivalent: (a) The fields K and L have the same zeta functions:
K (s) = L(s).
(b) For all rational prime p the arithmetic types of p in K and L coincide:
Ap(K) = Ap(L).
(c) For almost every rational prime p the arithmetic types of p in K and L coincide:
Ap(K) = Ap(L).

The "almost all" means that the set of primes

{p : Ap(K) = Ap(L)}
has Dirichelt density equal to 1. It is natural to ask if such density condition can be improved. Let K, L be number fields and let

AK,L := {p : Ap(K) = Ap(L)} \ ramified primes in KL. The statement of Perlis' theorem written in terms of the set AK,L reads as
(AK,L) < 1  K(s) = L(s).

Question 1. Can the bound of 1 be improved? In other words,

is there cK,L < 1 such that (AK,L)  cK,L  K(s) = L(s).

One of the main results of this paper is that indeed such a bound exists, moreover it is explicit and depends only on the degree of the fields.

Theorem (Theorem 4.2). Let n > 1 be an integer and let K, L be two degree n number

fields. Then, K and L are arithmetically equivalent if and only if the set of primes such

that

their

arithmetic

type

is

not

the

in

K

and

L

Density

less

K(s) = L(s).

We in fact give some heuristics evidence, and prove some particular cases, showing that

the

constant

1 4n2

could

be

improved

to

2 n2

.

Another interesting related question about Arithmetically equivalence is the following:

Suppose we have a number field K, and say we want to know if a given number field L is

arithmetically equivalent to it. Could we test the arithmetic type for a set of finitely many

primes and conclude from such finite sets whether or not K and L are A.E? Thanks to

Proposition 2.2 we now that a necessary condition for L to be arithmetically equivalent to

K is that they have the same Galois closure, hence we may assume that this is the case.

More explicitly, we ask

Question 2. Let K be a number field. Is there a positive constant XK such that for every number field L with the same Galois closure as K

K(s) = L(s)  Ap(K) = Ap(L) for all p  XK?

We answer this question in the positive and provide a constant for it.

Theorem (Theorem 5.7). Let K be a number field.Then, for every number field L such that K< = L we have that
K(s) = L(s)  Ap(K) = Ap(L) for all p  |Disc(K<)|12577.
Furthermore, under GRH the above bound can be replaced by (4 log(|Disc(K<)|) + 2.5[K< : Q] + 5)2

2. Preliminary definitions and results
Let E be a number field and let n be a positive integer. Let an(E) be the n-th coefficient of the Dedekind zeta function of E, i.e., an(E) := #{I OE : I = n}. It follows from basic principles of Dirichlet's series that two number fields K and L are arithmetically equivalent if and only if an(K) = an(L) for all non-negative integer n.

One of the first invariants of a number field that is captured by its Dedekind zeta function is the degree. Usually, see for instance [4, Theorem 1], the invariance of the degree is proved using the group theoretical characterization of arithmetic equivalence. Here we give a slightly different argument based on the existence of splitting primes. This we do since it motivates our focus of the set of splitting primes and the generalizations we will define later in the paper.

Lemma 2.1. Let K, L be number fields such that K(s) = L(s). Then, [K : Q] = [L : Q].
Proof. Let p be a prime that splits in K. Then, [K : Q] = ap(K). Since K(s) = L(s), [K : Q] = ap(K) = ap(L)  [L : Q]. By symmetry of the argument we have that [L : Q]  [K : Q].

Given a number field E we denote by SE the set of rational primes that split in E. An important feature of the set of splitting primes is that it determines the Galois closure of
a field. In particular, since

SE = {p : ap(E) = [E : Q]}

(2.1)

we have that the Dedekind zeta function determines the Galois closure. We denote by E< the Galois closure of a number field.

Proposition 2.2. Let K, L be number fields such that K(s) = L(s). Then, K< = L

Proof. Thanks to Lemma 2.1 we know that n := [K : Q] = [L : Q]. Hence, SK< = SK =

{p K<

: ap(K) = n} = {p : ap(L) = n} = SL = = L since they are Galois number fields.

SL.

Therefore,

SK<

= SL

which

implies

that

Definition 2.3. Let K, L be number fields let RamK,L be the set of rational primes that ramify in either K or L.

SK,L := TK,L :=

{p : #Ap(K) = #Ap(L)} \ RamK,L {p : ap(K) = ap(L)} \ RamK,L

Let K, L be number fields of the same degree. It follows from equation 2.1 that

SK  SL  TK,L, equivalently

SK<  SL  TK,L.

(2.2)

This gives a positive lower bound of (AK,L). More precisely,

Proposition 2.4. Let K, L be number fields of the same degree. Then,

1 [K<L :

Q]



(TK,L).

GUILLERMO MANTILLA-SOLER

Proof. By the compatibility of Frobenius elements in Galois extensions, see Lemma below, SK<L = SK<  SL. Thus, SK<L  TK,L and thanks to the Chebotarev's density theorem the result follows.

Lemma 2.5. Let K, L be number fields. Then,

SK<L = SK<  SL.
Proof. Since SE = SE< for any number field E, and since the compositum of the Galois closures is the Galois closure of the compositum, we may assume that K and L are Galois number fields. In that situation the statement is equivalent to say that a rational prime p splits in KL if and only if it splits in K and in L. This follows from the fact that Frobenius elements are compatible under restriction maps and that the product restriction map

Gal(KL/Q)  Gal(K/Q) × Gal(L/Q)

is injective.

Next we define the sets SE(m) in order to generalize the notion of splitting set of primes on a number field E

Definition 2.6. Let E be a degree n number field with discriminant E, and let m be a non-negative integer not bigger than n. We define the set

SE(m) := {p : ap(E) = m; p  E}.

Remark 2.7. Notice that SE(n) = SE, thus this definition is meant to generalize the splitting set SE.

Proposition 2.8. Let E be a degree n number field. Suppose that E/Q is Galois. If m is
a positive integer strictly less than n, SE(m) = . In other words, up to ramified primes, the set of prime numbers P is partitioned as SE(0)  SE. In particular, up to ramification,

SE(0) = {p : ap(E) < n}

and its density is equal to

(SE (0))

=

1

-

(SE )

=

n

- n

1.

Proof. Let p be a rational prime that is unramified in E and such that ap(E) = 0. By definition there is an ideal P in OE with norm p. In particular, P is maximal and the inertia degree of P over p is 1. Given that the E/Q is Galois and p is unramified we
conclude that the decomposition group of P over p is trivial. Hence p splits, so there are
n maximal ideals lying over p. This shows that if ap(E) = 0 then ap(E) = n proving the first claim. The second claim follows from the first, the additivity of Dirichlet's density
and the Chebotarev's density theorem.

Corollary 2.9. Let K, L be degree n Galois number fields. Then,

TK,L = (SK  SL) (P \ SK  P \ SL) .

Furthermore,

(TK,L)

=

2 [KL :

-

[L

Proof. Thanks to Proposition 2.8 if a prime p belongs to TK,L then either ap(K) = ap(L) = n or ap(K) = ap(L) < n from which the first claim follows. Since this is a disjoint union we have that

(TK,L) = (SK  SL) +  (P \ SK  P \ SL) = (SK  SL) + 1 - (SK  SL) =

The last equality follows from Lemma 2.5 and the Chebotarev's density theorem.

For general degree n number fields K and L an explicit description for (TK,L) follows from the fact that
n
TK,L = SK (m)  SL(m)
m=0
so that
n
(TK,L) = (SK (m)  SL(m)).
m=0
It seems hard however, for an arbitrary m and no hypothesis on K and L, to calculate the single term (SK (m)  SL(m). At this point the best we can do is to give an upper bound for (TK,L) following the ideas of Corollary 2.9

Proposition 2.10. Let K and L be degree n number fields. Then,

(TK,L)



2 [K<L :

Q]

+

-

1 [K< :

Q]

-

[L

1. : Q]

If both K and L are Galois, the inequality becomes an equality.

Proof. Let m be a non-negative integer strictly less than n. Then, SE(m)  P \ SE for E equal to either K or L. Therefore for such values of m,

SK(m)  SL(m)  P \ SK  P \ SL.
In particular,
n
TK,L = SK (m)  SL(m)  (P \ SK  P \ SL)
m=0
Hence, arguing as in the proof of Corollary 2.9,

(SK  SL) .

(TK,L)  2(SK  SL) + 1 - (SK ) - (SL) = 2(SK<  SL) + 1 - (SK<) - (SL)

The last claim follows from Corollary 2.9.

Motivated by the results we have obtained so far we define the quantity K,L.

K,L

Proposition 2.12. Let K and L be number fields. Then,

1 [K<L :

K,L

where equality on the right occurs if and only if K< = L and equality on the left occurs

if and only if either K or L is equal to Q.

Proof. The inequality of the left follows from Propositions 2.4 and 2.10. Clearly if either

K

or

L

is

equal

to

Q

then

1 [K<L:Q]

Conversely,

if

Since both terms in the sum are non-negative it follows that they are both equal to 0 which implies that either K or L is Q. To show the remaining part notice that

[K< : Q][L : Q]  [KL : Q]2

and that equality occurs if and only if K< = L. It follows from the AM-GM inequality that

2 [KL :

1 [K< :

1 [L : Q]

with equality if and only if K< = L. This is equivalent K,L  1 and the claim about the occurrence of equality.

3. Naive approach
Having defined K,L we start a first approach to answer Question 1 based on its relation to (AK,L) and to similar quantities we define next.
Remark 3.1. Notice that AK,L  SK,LTK,L. In particular, (AK,L)  min{(SK,L), (TK,L)}.
Corollary 3.2. Let K and L be degree n number fields. Then,
(AK,L)  K,L.
Proof. Since (AK,L)  (TK,L) the result follows from Proposition 2.10.
Some of the classical results on Arithmetic equivalence can be phrased in terms of the above:
Theorem 3.3. Let K and L be number fields. The following are equivalent: (i) K(s) = L(s) (ii) (AK,L) = 1
(iii) (TK,L) = 1 (iv) (SK,L) = 1.

DENSITY QUESTIONS ON ARITHMETIC EQUIVALENCE

Proof. The implication (i)  (ii) follows from equality of coefficients in convergent Dirichlet series. The implications (i)  (iii), (iv) follow from the remark above. For (iii)  (i) see [2]. Lastly, for (vi)  (i) see [3] or [5].
Lemma 3.4. Let K, L be Galois number fields of the same prime degree. Let p be a rational prime not ramified in either field. Then, ap(K) = ap(L) if and only if Ap(K) = Ap(L). In particular,
(AK,L) = K,L.
Proof. Let  be the common degree. Since both extensions are Galois we have that either ap(K) = ap(L) =  or ap(K) = ap(L) = 0. The former happens if and only if p splits equivalently if and only if Ap(K) = Ap(L) = (1, 1, ..., 1). Since  is prime the later occurs if and only there is only one prime laying over p in either field, i.e., if and only if Ap(K) = Ap(L) = (). It follows that (AK,L) = (TK,L), which concludes the proof thanks to the second part of Proposition 2.10.

These results about K,L give us a first clue on what to expect of an answer to Question 1. Next we show some candidates for bounds in degrees 2 and 3.

Theorem 3.5. Let  be a prime and let K, L be Galois number fields of degree . Suppose

that

(AK,L)

>

1-

2 2

.

Then, K and L are arithmetically equivalent.

Furthermore, if

=

2

and

(AK,L) = 1 -

1 22

=

1 2

then

K

and

L

are

not

arithmetically

equivalent.

Proof. Since any Galois number field is solitary, i.e., any other field with the same Dedekind

zeta function is isomorphic to it, we must prove that the hypothesis implies that K and

L

are

isomorphic.

By

Corollary

3.2

we

have

that

K,L

>

1-

2 2

.

Thus,

2 [KL :

+

1

-

1 

-

>

1

-

2 2

,

equivalently

2 -1

> [KL : Q].

This last inequality cannot be unless K

and L are the

same field, otherwise they would be linearly disjoint. To show the last part, notice that if

K

and

L

are

not

isomorphic

then

K,L

=

+1-

1 2

-

Since

both

of prime degree, (AK,L) = K,L thanks to Lemma 3.4.

3.0.1. A heuristic argument for a bound depending only on the degree. As we saw in The-

orems 3.5, 3.6, K,L played an important role in answering Question 1 in degrees 2 and 3.

For now on let us fix the degree n of the number fields in question. In both theorems above

we saw that there is a constant bn, for n = 2, 3, such that if (AK,L) > bn then K and L

are arithmetically equivalent. The argument in both cases was the same; (AK,L) > bn

implies that K,L > bn and, thanks to that in this specific situation the fields are solitary,

arithmetic equivalence between them is equivalent to prove isomorphism. This suggests a

strategy to look for a constant bn for all n. Since K,L = (TK,L) for K and L Galois, and

Galois fields are solitary, we could try and see if there is a constant bn such that K,L > bn implies that K and L are isomorphic(in fact the same since they are Galois). Based on

the two theorems above, and similar calculations done in Galois quartic fields, we observe

that

bn

=

1

-

2 n2

is a good candidate. The following theorem confirms our choice.

Theorem 3.7. Let n be positive integer and let K and L be Galois number fields of degree

n. Then,

K,L

>

1

-

2 n2

=

K

=

L.

Proof.

Since

K, L

are

degree

n

Galois

we

have

by

definition

that

K,L

=

2 [KL :

2 n

Therefore,

after

multiplying

by

n2 2

and

reordering,

K,L

>1-

2 n2

is

equivalent

to

1

>

n [KL :

K] ([KL

-

1).

Since both extensions are Galois of degree n, [KL : K] is a divisor of n hence the two factors on the right are non-negative integers which implies that [KL : K] = 1, and thus K = L.

Remark

3.8.

Notice

that

bigger

that

in

Theorem

3.6,

hence it looks that there might be some room for improvement for the expression of bn.

This seems not to be the case since for n = 2 the constant b2 is sharp.

4. Geometric approach

In the previous section we proved that for degrees up to n = 3

(AK,L)

>

1

-

2 n2



K (s) = L(s).

This in fact can be improved to n = 4 but requires a lot of ad hoc calculations depending on the behavior of the Galois closures of quartic fields. Here we take a different approach to obtain a similar bound as the above, not as strong, but with the great advantage that the bound works for all n.

The geometric approach we use here is to look at K(s) as the Weil-Zeta function of the Scheme XK := Spec(OK ). With this natural interpretation one can see, see [2, Theorem

2.5], that the density of the set of primes p for which #XK(Fp) = #XL(Fp) is the same as (TK,L). Since
(AK,L)  (TK,L)
studying #XK (Fp) = #XL(Fp) will gives us a way to obtain upper bounds for (AK,L). The following theorem is precisely the kind of result that we are looking for.

Theorem 4.1. [6, Theorem 6.17]
Let X1, X2 be separated schemes of finite type over Z. Let S be a finitely set of primes such that X1 and X2 have good reduction away from S. Suppose that #X1(Fp) = #X2(Fp) for at least one prime p / S. Then,

where B := B(X1) + B(X2) and

B(Xi) = dimQ Hjc(Xi(C), Q) for i = 1, 2.

Theorem 4.1 provides the right setting for our purposes.

Theorem 4.2. Let n be a positive integers and let K, L be degree n number fields. Then,

K and L are arithmetically equivalent if and only if the set of primes such that their

i.e.,

K(s) = L(s).

Proof. Let X1 := Spec(OK ) and X1 := Spec(OL). Since the ring of integers of a number

fields is a finitely generated Z-module both X1 and X2 are of finite type over Z, and

being affine they are separated. Notice that X1(C) is a finite set of n elements, corre-

sponding to the complex embeddings of K, same for L, hence dimQ H0c (Xi(C), Q) = n and dimQ Hjc(Xi(C), Q) = 0 for j > 0. Therefore B = B(X1) + B(X2) = 2n. We

conclude from Theorem 4.1 that if there is a prime p not ramifying in either K or L

such

that

ap (K )

=

#X1(Fp)

=

#X2(Fp)

=

ap(L)

then

Suppose

that

(AK,L)

Since

it

follows

from

our

previous

argument

that ap(K) = ap(L) for all but finitely many primes, hence K(s) = L(s). The other

implication is clear since K(s) = L(s) implies that (AK,L) = 1.

Theorem 4.2 confirms, with a weaker bound, the heuristics presented in the previous section. Based on this result and the heuristics we conjecture the following.

Conjecture 4.3. The bound of 4n2 in Theorem 4.2 can be improved to n2 .

Remark 4.4. Notice that we have proved the conjecture in the cases n = 2, 3; this was done in part of Theorems 3.5, 3.6.

5. Efective bounds on arithmetic equivalence

In giving and answer to Question 1 we looked at the function K(s) as the Weil-zeta function of the scheme SpecOK . Now, for Question 2 we see K(s) as the Artin Lfunction of Galois representation K : GQ  GLn(C). With this in hand Question 2 can be answered by applying an effective version of Chebotarev's density theorem.

5.0.1. Dedekind zeta function as Artin L-function of a representation of GQ. Let K be a degree n number field, and let us denote by K< its Galois closure over Q. We start
by recalling the construction of an n-dimensional complex Galois representation K of the absolute Galois group GQ such that the Artin L-function associated to K is K(s). Let Emb(K) be the set of complex embeddings of K. The absolute Galois group GQ acts continuously on Emb(K) via composition. The continuity follows since the kernel
of the action is the open group GK<. Since n = #Emb(K) the above gives a continuous permutation representation GQ : K  Sn, which by composition with the permutation representation n : Sn  GLn(C) produces an n-dimensional complex representation

K : GQ  GLn(C).

Definition 5.1. Let K be a number field. The continuous C[GQ]-module TK is the GQ-

module attached to the representation K . In other words, TK :=

C with the

action of GQ on each element of the basis given by composition.

Emb

The relevance of this representation to our purposes is that the Artin formalism gives us the following:

Proposition 5.2. Let K be a number field and let us denote by L(, s) the Artin Lfunction attached to a representation . Then L(K, s) = K(s).
Proof. By Galois correspondence K factorizes through a map K : Gal(K</Q)  GLn(C)

GQ

ResQ

Gal(K</Q)

GLn(C)

Again, by basic Galois theory, the action of Gal(K</Q) in Emb(K) is isomorphic to the permutation representation of Gal(K</Q) in the set of cosets Gal(K</Q)/Gal(K</K). Hence, K = IndGGaall((KK<<//KQ))1Gal(K</K). Thanks to Artin's formalism

L(K , s) = L (K , s) = L IndGGaall((KK<<//QK))1Gal(K</K), s = L(1Gal(K</K), s) = K (s).

Since the Dedekind zeta function is an Artin L-function then its prime terms correspond to traces of Frobenius elements:

Corollary 5.3. Let K be a number field and  be a prime unramified1 under K. Let Frob be the conjugacy class of the element Frobenius at . Then,
Trace(K (Frob)) = a(K).
Proposition 5.2 gives not only a simple way to express the trace of Frobenius but it also gives a useful generalization of the above corollary to calculate its characteristic polynomial det(X - K (Frob)).
Lemma 5.4. Let K be a number field and  be a prime, unramified in K, and let (f1, ..., fg) be the arithmetic type of  in K. Then,
g
det(X - K (Frob)) = (Xfi - 1).
i=1
For a proof see [2, Lemma 2.4].

This type of analysis provides a way to obtain several of the classic results about arithmetic equivalence. For instance, using Corollary 5.3 the equivalence (i), (iii) of Theorem 3.3
(TK,L) = 1  K(s) = K(s)
is obtained. This point of view together with an effective version of Chebotarev's density theorem
gives an answer to Question 2. For details about an effective version of Chebotarev's density theorem, and a proof of the following, see [1].

Theorem 5.5. Let E be a Galois number field with Galois group G = Gal(E/Q) and
absolute value discriminant D and degree N . For every conjugacy class C of G there is a rational prime p, unramified in E, such that p  D12577 and the conjugacy class of a Frobenius element at p is equal to C. Under GRH the bound D12577 can be replaced by

(4 log(D) + 2.5N + 5)2.

Definition 5.6. Let K be a number field with Galois closure K<. Suppose that K< has degree nK< and absolute value of the discriminant equal to dK<. Let
XK := d1K<2577 XK1 := (4 log(dK<) + 2.5nK< + 5)2
Theorem 5.7. Let K be a number field. Then, for every number field L such that K< = L we have that
K (s) = L(s)  Ap(K) = Ap(L) for all p  XK. Moreover, under GRH the bound XK can be replaced by XK1 .

Proof. Suppose that Ap(K) = Ap(L) for all p  XK (resp. XK1 ). Since ap(K) is equal to

the Let

number   GQ

of 1's in Ap(K), resp. and let   Gal(K</Q)

for be

L, the

then ap(K) = ap(L) for all p  XK restriction of  to K<. By Theorem

resp. XK1 . 5.5 there is

a prime p  XK (resp. XK1 under GRH) such that  is the conjugacy class of a Frobenius

element in Gal(K</Q) at p, since K< = L we have that

say

FrobKp< .

Then,

since

E  ResEQ< =

E ,

for

E

=

K, L,

and

Trace(K ()) = Trace(K ()) = Trace(K (FrobKp<)) = ap(K) =

ap(L) = Trace(L(FrobKp<)) = Trace(L()) = Trace(L()).

Since  is an arbitrary element, and K and L are Artin representations, we have that K and L are equivalent so their L-functions are the same, i.e., K(s) = L(s) thanks to Proposition 5.2. The reverse implication is clear by Theorem 1.2.

Remark 5.8. Thanks to a result of Zaman, see [7], the bound d1K<2577 can be replaced by a bound of the form Cd4K<0 where C is an effective absolute constant.
