## Abstract

The effect of the self-energy on the photon-proton elastic scattering is investigated for the backward and the forward directions. The shape of the Thomson scattering at the photon energy $\omega \to 0$ is broken by taking into account the self-energy of proton. The electromagnetic polarizabilities $\bar{\alpha}\pm\bar{\beta}$ are calculated by the lowest-order perturbative treatment.
