Abstract. For a given odd positive integer n and an oddprime p, we construct an infinite family of quadruples of imaginary quadratic fields Q( d), Q( d + 1), Q( d + 4) and Q( d + 4p2) with d  Z such that the class number of each of them is divisible by n. Subsequently, we show that there is an infinite family of quintuples of imaginary quadratic fields Q( d), Q( d + 1), Q( d + 4), Q( d + 36) and Q( d + 100) with d  Z whose class numbers are all divisible by n. Our results provide a complete proof of Iizuka's conjecture (in fact a generalization of it) for the case m = 1. Our results also affirmatively answer a weaker version of (a generalization of) Iizuka's conjecture for m  4.

1. Introduction
It has been proved that there are infinitely many real (resp. imaginary) quadratic fields with class numbers divisible by a given positive integer (see [1, 3, 21, 24]). An analogous problem for tuples of quadratic fields arises from Scholz's Spiegelungssatz [19]. Later, Komatsu [13] studied this problem for a pair of quadratic fields and proved that there are infinitely many pairs of quadratic fields Q( d) and Q( md) with m, d  Z whose class numbers are divisible by 3. In [14], he generalized this result to n-divisibility with n > 1 any integer for pairs of imaginary quadratic fields. On the other hand, Iizuka [11] studied a slight variant of this problem and construct an infinite family of pairs of imaginary quadratic fields Q( d) and Q( d + 1) with d  Z whose class numbers are divisible by 3. Further, he posed the following conjecture in the same paper.

Conjecture 1.1. For any prime number p and any positive integer m, there is an infinite

family of m + 1 successive real (or imaginary) quadratic fields





Q( d), Q( d + 1), · · · , Q( d + m)

with d  Z whose class numbers are divisible by p.

In [4], Chattopadhyay and Muthukrishnan extended Iizuka's result from pairs to certain triples of imaginary quadratic fields following the methods used in [11]. In other words, they gave an affirmative answer of a weaker version of Conjecture 1.1 for p = 3. It follows from a recent result of Iizuki, Konomi and Nakano [12] that Conjecture 1.1 is true for m = 1 when p = 3, 5, 7.
Very recently, Krishnamoorthy and Pasupulati [15] cleverly used [16, Theorem 1] and an extended version of [9, Theorem 3.2] to settled Conjecture 1.1 for m = 1.
In this paper, for a given odd primep we construct an infinite family of quadruples of imaginary quadratic fields Q( d), Q( d + 1), Q( d + 4) and Q( d + 4p2) with d  Z whose class numbers are all divisible by any odd integer n  3. This extends the results of [4, 12, 15] in both directions; from pairs to quadruples of fields and from primes to odd integers. It also gives a proof of a weaker version of Conjecture 1.1 for any prime p  3 (in fact for any odd integer n  3). The precise statement of our main result is the following:

Theorem 1.1. For any odd positive integer n and any odd prime p, there are infinitely many quadruples of imaginary quadratic fields Q( d), Q( d + 1), Q( d + 4) and Q( d + 4p2) whose class numbers are all divisible by n.

It is noted that we can construct an infinite family of quintuples or higher tuples of imaginary quadratic fields whose class numbers are all divisible by n by choosing different values for the prime p. For instance, utilizing Corollary 3.1 and following the proof of Theorem 1.1, we get the following:

Theorem 1.2. For a given odd integer n  1, there are infinitely many quintuples of imaginary quadratic fields









Q( d), Q( d + 1), Q( d + 4), Q( d + 36), Q( d + 100)

with d  Z whose class numbers are all divisible by n.

Our method relies on the prominent result of Bilu, Hanrot and Voutier [2] concerning the primitive divisors of Lehmer numbers as well as on the solvability of certain LebesgueRamanujan-Nagell type equations considered in [8]. This method does not allow us to include an imaginary quadratic field in the tuple of the form Q( d + m) for a non-square integer m.

2. n-divisibility of the class-numbers of Q 1 - 4Un and Q 1 - V n

Here, we recall the results concerning the n-divisibility of the class numbers of the imaginary quadratic fields Q 1 - 4Un and Q 1 - V n . These results will be used in the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Theorem A. If n  3 is an odd integer, then for any integer U  2 the ideal class groups of the imaginary quadratic fields Q( 1 - 4Un) contain an element of order n.

In 1978, Gross and Rohrlich gave the outline of a proof of this theorem (see [6, Theorem

5.3 and Remark 2]). Their idea of proof is based uponthe affine points on the Fermat curve xp + yp = 1 over the imaginary quadratic field Q( 1 - 4Un). Later, Louboutin [16]

gave a complete proof of this theorem using number theoretic technique. It follows from

Siegel's theorem (see [20]) that for each integer d > 1 there are at most finitely many

positive integers U such that 1 - 4Un = -dX2. This ensures the infinitude of the above

family of imaginary quadratic fields.

The n-divisibility of the class numbers of the family of imaginary quadratic fields Q( 1 - V n) was studied by Nagell [18, Theorem 25] for any odd integers V  3 and

n  3. Later, Murty [17, Theorems quadratic field Q( 1 - V n) has an

1 and 2] element

proved that the class group of the imaginary of order n when either V n - 1 is square-free

or its square part < V n/2/8 for any odd integers V  5 and n  3. However, it follows

from the fact DX2 + 1 = V n has no integer solution when both V and n are odd, except

for (V, n) = (5, 3), (7, 3), (13, 3) (see [7]), that the above conditions are no longer required.

This fact also confirms that there are infinitely many such imaginary quadratic fields.

Finally, this was elucidated by Cohn in [5, Corollary 1] as follows:

Theorem B. Assume that n  3 and V  3 are odd integers. Then the class number of the imaginary quadratic field Q( 1 - V n) is divisible by n, except for (n, V ) = (5, 3).

3. The divisibility of the class number of Q( p2 - n)
Many special cases of the divisibility of the class number of the imaginary quadratic field Q( x2 - yn) have been studied with some restrictions on x, y and n. One of the such restrictions is that y is an odd prime (see [3] and the references therein), and hence none of the known results can be used to complete the proof of Theorem (1.1). Thus, we consider a family of imaginary quadratic fields of the above form where y is not a prime and it will be a useful ingredient in the proof of Theorem 1.1. Here, we mainly prove:

Theorem 3.1. Let  > 1 and n > 1 be odd integers, and p an odd prime such that   3 (mod 4), gcd(, p) = 1 and p2 < n. Assume that -d be the square-free part of p2 - n. If p  ±1 (mod d), then the class number of Q( p2 - n) is divisible by n.

This theorem extends Theorem 1.1 in [3], where the authors assumed that  is an odd prime. Note that this primality condition on  restricts us to apply [3, Theorem 1.1] in the proof of Theorem 1.1. Further, following the proof of [3, Theorem 1.2], we can get the following remark.

Remark 3.1. The family of imaginary quadratic fields discussed in Theorem 3.1 has infinitely many members.

Now for p = 3, 5, the condition `p  ±1 (mod d)' can be removed using 3.7 except (, n) = (3, 3), and thus we have the following straightforward corollary.

Corollary 3.1. Let  > 1 and n > 1 be as in Theorem 3.1. For x = 3, 5 satisfying gcd(, x) = 1, the class number of Q( x2 - n) is divisible by n except the case (, n) = (3, 3).

The proof of Theorem 3.1 relies on the prominent result of Bilu, Hanrot and Voutier [2] on existence of primitive divisors of Lehmer numbers.

3.1. Lehmer numbers and their primitive divisors. A pair (, ) of algebraic in-

tegers is said to be a Lehmer pair if ( + )2 and  are two non-zero coprime rational

integers, and / is not a root of unity. For a given positive integer n, the Lehmer

numbers correspond to the pair (, ) are defined as

Ln(,

)

=


  
  

n

, ,

if n is odd, if n is even.

It is known that all Lehmer numbers are non-zero rational integers. Two Lehmer pairs (1, 1) and (2, 2) are said to be equivalent if 1/2 = 1/2  {±1, ± -1}. A prime divisor p of Ln(, ) is said to be primitive if p  (2 - 2)2L1(, )L2(, ) · · · Ln-1(, ). The following classical result was proved in [2, Theorem 1.4].

Theorem C. The Lehmer number Ln(, ) has primitive divisors for any integer n > 30.

Given

a

Lehmer pair

(, ),

let

a

=

( + )2

and

b

=

( - )2.

Then



=

(a

±

 b)/2

and  = ( a  b)/2. The pair (a, b) is called the parameters corresponding to the

Lehmer pair (, ). The following lemma is extracted from [22, Theorem 1].

Lemma 3.1. Let t be an odd integer such that 7  t  29. If the Lehmer numbers Lt(, ) have no primitive divisor, then up to equivalence, the parameters (a, b) of the corresponding pair (, ) are as follows:
(i) (a, b) = (1, -7), (1, -19), (3, -5), (5, -7), (13, -3), (14, -22) when t = 7; (ii) (a, b) = (5, -3), (7, -1), (7, -5) when t = 9; (iii) (a, b) = (1, -7) when t = 13; (iv) (a, b) = (7, -1), (10, -2) when t = 15.

Let Fk (resp. Lk) denote the k-th term in the Fibonacci (resp. Lucas) sequence defined by F0 = 0, F1 = 1, and Fk+2 = Fk + Fk+1 (resp. L0 = 2, L1 = 1, and Lk+2 = Lk + Lk+1), where k  0 is an integer. The following lemma is a part of [2, Theorem 1.3].

Lemma 3.2. For p = 3, 5, let the Lehmer numbers Lp(, ) have no primitive divisor. Then up to equivalence, the parameters (a, b) of the corresponding pair (, ) are:
 (1 + t, 1 - 3t) with t = 1, (i) For p = 3, (a, b) = (3k + t, 3k - 3t) with t  0 (mod 3), (k, t) = (1, 1);
 (ii) For p = 5, (a, b) = (Fk-2, Fk-2 - 4Fk) with k  3,
(Lk-2, Lk-2 - 4Lk) with k = 1; where t = 0 and k  0 are any integers and  = ±1.

3.2. Two important lemmas. Given an integer D  0, 1 (mod 4), assume that h(D) is the class number of binary quadratic primitive forms with discriminant D. Also for a square-free integer d, let h(d) be denote the class number of Q( d). Then we have (cf. [10, §16.13; p. 444] the following:

Lemma 3.3. Let d  2 (mod 4) be a square-free positive integer. Then h(-d) = h(-4d).

The following lemma is a special case of [8, Theorem 6.2] when (D1, D2) = (1, -d).

Lemma 3.4. Let d > 3 and  > 1 be integers such that gcd(, 2d) = 1. If the equation x2 + dy2 = z, x, y, z  N, gcd(x, y) = 1

has a solution, then all the solutions (x, y, z) of this equation can be expressed as





x + y -d = (a + µb -d)t, z = st,

where a, b, s, t are positive integers satisfying a2 + db2 = s, gcd(a, b) = 1 and s | h(-4d)

6

and , µ  {-1, 1}.

3.3. Proof of Theorem 3.1. Let d be the square-free part of n-p2. Then p2-n = -dr2 for some r  N, and thus (x, y, z) = (p, r, n) is a positive integer solution of the equation
x2 + dy2 = z, gcd(x, y) = 1.

Thus by Lemma 3.4, we get





p + r -d = (a + µb -d)t, , µ  {-1, 1}

(3.1)

with n = st, s, t  N,
where a and b are positive integers satisfying a2 + db2 = s, gcd(a, b) = 1

(3.2) (3.3)

and

s | h(-4d).

(3.4)

Since   3 (mod 4) and n is odd, so that p2 - n = -dr2 gives d  2 (mod 4) and r is odd. Also s and t are both odd as n is odd. Further reading (3.3) modulo 4, we get a2 + 2b2  3 (mod 4) as   3 (mod 4) and s is odd, which ensures that both a and b are odd.
We now equate the real parts from both sides in (3.1) to get

t-1 2
p = a
j=0

t 2j

at-2j -1 (-db2 )j .

(3.5)

This implies a | p and thus a = 1, p. If a = 1, then it becomes

t-1
2 t (-db2)j = p = ±p. 2j
j=0

(3.6)

Reading (3.6) modulo d, we get p  ±1 (mod d), which contradicts to the assumption. Therefore a = p and thus (3.5) becomes

t-1

t pt-2j-1(-db2)j =  = ±1.

2j

j=0

(3.7)

As a = p, so that (3.1) reduces to





p + r -d = (p + µb -d)t, , µ  {-1, 1}.

(3.8)

We now assume that  = µb -d + p and  = µb -d - p. Then both  and  are

algebraic integers. Clearly, ( + )2 = -4db2 and  = -p2 - db2 = -s (by (3.3)) are

coprime rational integers. Furthermore, it follows from the following identity

4db2 s

that

s

Since  > 1 and gcd(s, 2(s - 2db2)) = gcd(s, 4db2) = gcd(p2 + db2, 4db2) = 1, so that the

last

equation

shows

that

Therefore

(, )

is

a

Lehmer

pair

with

parameters (-4db2, 4p2) and thus the corresponding Lehmer number for t is

Lt(, )

=

t 

- -

t 

as t is odd. Utilizing (3.8), we get

|Lt(, )| = 1.

This confirms that the Lehmer number Lt(, ) has no primitive divisor, and hence Theorem C and Lemma 3.1 (utilizing the fact that (-4db2, 4p2) is the parameters) ensure that t  {1, 3, 5}.
In case of t = 5, we get by Lemma 3.2 that -4db2 = Fk-2 or -4db2 = Lk-2. None of these is possible.
Finally for t = 3, (3.7) implies that p2 - 3db2 = ±1. Reading it modulo 4, we see that `+' sign is not possible, and thus p2 - 3db2 = -1. This is not possible by reading it modulo 3.
Therefore t = 1, and thus (3.2) and (3.4) together imply that n | h(-4d). Thus, we complete the proof by Lemma 3.3.

4. Proof of Theorem 1.1

We first fix an odd integer n  3. We now define the set

Nn = {k  N : n | h(1 - 4kn)} .

Then by Theorem A the set Nn is an infinite.





Now for any k  Nn, we set d = 4(1 - 4kn)n. Then Q( d) = Q( 1 - 4kn) as n is odd.

Thus, by Theorem A there are infinitely many such d satisfying n | h(d). In other words, F (Nn) = {Q( 1 - 4kn) : k  Nn} is an infinite set.

8

AZIZUL HOQUE

We now assume that U = 4kn - 1 with k  Nn. Then 1 - 4U n = 1 - 4(4kn - 1)n = 4(1 - 4kn)n + 1 = d + 1, and thus by Theorem A, we have n | h(d + 1).
Again for k  Nn, let us assume that V = 4kn - 1. Then V  3 and is odd, and thus by Theorem B, we get n | h(1-V n). Since 4(1-V n) = 4-4(4kn-1)n = 4+4(1-4kn)n = d+4 and Q( 4(1 - V n)) = Q( (1 - V n)), so that n | h(d + 4).
Finally for any k  Nn, let  = 4kn - 1. Then   3 (mod 4) and hence by utilizing Theorem 3.1, we have n | h(p2 -n) for any odd prime p satisfying p  ±1 (mod d). Here, d is the square-free part of n - p2. Now 4(p2 - n)n = 4p2 - 4n = 4p2 - 4(4kn - 1)n = d + 4p2 which implies that Q( d + 4p2) = Q( 4(p2 - n)), and thus n | h(d + 4p2). This
completes the proof of Theorem 1.1.

5. Concluding remarks
In [23], Xie and Chao studied Conjecture 1.1 and proved the following result using Yamamoto's [24] construction.

Theorem D. For any odd positive integer n and any positive integer m, there are infinitely many pairs of imaginary fields Q( d) and Q( d + m) whose class groups have an element of order n respectively.

Theorem D can be viewed as a weaker variant of a generalization of Conjecture 1.1. For m = 1, it provides a generalization of the main result of [15] though [23] appeared before [15]. In other words, Theorem D gives a complete proof of the following generalization of Conjecture 1.1 for m = 1 and a proof of a weaker version of the same for m  2.

Conjecture 5.1. For any odd integer n  3 and any integer m  1, there is an infinite

family of m + 1 successive imaginary (or real) quadratic fields





Q( d), Q( d + 1), · · · , Q( d + m)

with d  Z whose class numbers are all divisible by n.

Theorem 1.1 offers a constructive proof of Conjecture 5.1 for m = 1. This theorem also offers a proof of a weaker version of Conjecture 5.1for m = 4, which has missed the family of imaginary quadratic fields Q( d + 2) and Q( d + 3) from the complete proof. When m = 4p2 with p an odd prime, Theorem 1.1 presents a proof of a weaker version of Conjecture 5.1. We complete this paper by the following remark.

Remark 5.1. For a given positive integer m, let pm denote the largest prime less than or equal to m and (m) the prime-counting function. Then for a given positive odd integer

n, our construction gives an infinite family of at least ((m) + 2)-tuples of imaginary

quadratic fields,







Q( d), Q( d + 1), Q( d + 4), Q( d + 36), · · · Q( d + 4p2m)

with d  Z whose class numbers are all divisible by n.
