## Abstract

Logistic regression is an important statistical tool for assessing the probability of an outcome based upon some predictive variables. Standard methods can only deal with precisely known data, however many datasets have uncertainties which traditional methods either reduce to a single point or completely disregarded. In this paper we show that it is possible to include these uncertainties by considering an imprecise logistic regression model using the set of possible models that can be obtained from values from within the intervals. This has the advantage of clearly expressing the epistemic uncertainty removed by traditional methods.
