STOCHASTIC MAXIMAL Lp(Lq)-REGULARITY FOR SECOND ORDER SYSTEMS WITH PERIODIC BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
ANTONIO AGRESTI AND MARK VERAAR
Abstract. In this paper we consider an SPDE where the leading term is a second order systems with periodic boundary conditions with measurable coefficients in (t, ) and H¨older continuous coefficients in space. Assuming stochastic parabolicity conditions, we prove Lp((0, T ), tdt; H,q(Td))-estimates. The main novelty is that we do not require p = q. Moreover, we allow arbitrary   R and weights in time. Such mixed regularity estimates play a crucial role in applications to nonlinear SPDEs which is clear from our previous work, and will be further applied in forthcoming papers on reaction diffusion equations and Navier-Stokes equations. To prove our main results we develop a general perturbation theory for SPDEs. Moreover, we prove a new result on pointwise multiplication in spaces with fractional smoothness.

1. Introduction

In this paper we consider second order systems on the torus Td:

(1.1)

du - Audt = f dt + n1(Bnu + gn)dwtn, on Td,

u(s) = 0,

on Td.

Here A is a second order operator, Bn are first order operators, and we suppose that a stochastic parabolicity condition holds (see e.g. (1.3) below). The processes (wn)n1 are independent standard Brownian motions on a filtered probability space. Our goal is to prove optimal regularity estimates for the solution to (1.1) in a weighted Lp-setting in time and in H,q in space, where   R and p, q  [2, ) are arbitrary. Our motivation for considering optimal regularity estimates for linear
problems such as (1.1) comes from the applications to nonlinear SPDEs which were recently obtained in [AV21a, AV21b]. In particular, from these works it is clear
that having full flexibility in , p, q is important when considering critical spaces
for nonlinear SPDEs (also see [PSW18] for the deterministic case). Unfortunately, in the stochastic case there are very few results available in the
case p = q. The aim of this paper is to obtain sufficient conditions for optimal
regularity results with as much flexibility as possible. In the case the coefficients of A and B are only dependent on x (space), and b = 0 (or small), Lp(Lq)-theory can
be deduced from [NVW12], where a sufficient conditions for stochastic maximal

regularity is given in terms of the H-functional calculus of the leading differential operator. Moreover, in [LV20b] an extrapolation result was obtained which can be used to go from an Lq(Lq)-setting to an Lp(Lq)-setting.
Unfortunately, both of the latter results cannot directly be used if the coefficients are (t, , x)-dependent and B is not small. However, if p = q, then many sufficient conditions are available in the literature (see [KL13, Kry99, PV19] and references therein). Moreover, in [PV19] the case p = q is covered if the coefficients are only (t, )-dependent. The difficulties in case p = q are due to the fact that Fubini arguments fail, and this has consequences for localization arguments. In [GV17] this problem was circumvented for deterministic PDEs with continuous coefficient by using the weighted extrapolation theory of Rubio de Francia. This was further improved to VMO-coefficients in space in [DK18]. At the moment the latter approach seems not available for SPDEs.
In the current paper we give suitable conditions under which a localization argument can be done in the p = q setting. Here we only assume regularity conditions on the coefficients in the space variable. In (t, ) the coefficients are only assumed to be progressively measurable. Our starting point is the case of space-independent coefficients previously considered in [PV19]. In the case of (t, , x)-dependent coefficient we obtain stochastic maximal Lp-regularity using a new abstract perturbation result for stochastic maximal Lp-regularity, and new results on pointwise multiplication in spaces of fractional smoothness, we are able to apply the general framework of [PV19] combined with some results from [AV21a, AV21b], to do a localization argument to build in x-dependence. In follow-up papers we apply our results to stochastic reaction diffusion equations and Navier-Stokes equations.
To finish this introduction we state a special case of our main result in the case of scalar equations (Theorem 5.2 for m = 1). Below P and B denote the progressive and the Borel -algebra, respectively.

The following follows from Theorem 5.2, where also systems and mixed spacetime regularity are considered.

Theorem 1.2. Suppose that Assumption 1.1 holds. Let p  (2, ), q  [2, ) and   [0, p/2 - 1) (or p = q = 2 and  = 0). Let w(t) = t. Then for each
f  LpP( × (0, T ), w; H,q(Td)), and g  LpP( × (0, T ), w; H1+,q(Td; 2))
there exists a unique strong solution u to (1.1) and

with implicit constant independent of (f, g).
A similar result holds for Rd in case the coefficients become constant for |x|   (see Remark 5.7). Furthermore, a version of the result also holds for non-divergence type operators (see Theorem 5.3).

2. Preliminaries

In this section we collect known facts and fix our notation. Here X denotes a Banach space.

2.1. Function spaces. For details on vector-valued functions spaces and complex

interpolation we refer to [Ama19, HNVW16, MV12, Tri95]. For an open subset O 

Rd and k  N0, Ck(O; X) denotes the space of all k-times continuous differentiable functions with bounded derivatives endowed with its supremum norm. For  =

k + s with k  N0 and s  (0, 1) define C(O; X) to be the space of functions f  Ck(O; X) for which the derivatives of order  k are s-H¨older continuous.

For p  (1, ),   (-1, p - 1) and a  0, wa denotes the shifted power weight

wa(t) := |t - a|, t  R,

w := w0 .

For I = (a, b) where 0  a < b  , let Lp(I, wa; X) be the space of all strongly measurable functions f : I  X such that

f Lp(I,wa;X) :=

b

f (t)

where we omit the weight from the above notation if  = 0. Let W 1,p(I, wa; X) denote the subspace of Lp(I, wa; X) such that the weak derivative satisfies f   Lp(I, wa; X). This space is endowed with the norm:

f W 1,p(I,wa;X) := f Lp(I,wa;X) + f  Lp(I,wa;X).

Furthermore, for   (0, 1) let

0W 1,p(I, wa; X) = {f  W 1,p(I, wa; X) : f (a) = 0}, H,p(I, wa; X) = [Lp(I, wa; X), W 1,p(I, wa; X)] (complex interpolation), 0H,p(I, wa; X) = [Lp(I, wa; X1), 0W 1,p(I, wa; X)].

2.2. Stochastic maximal Lp-regularity. Next we will introduce the main abstract setting to define stochastic maximal Lp-regularity.

Assumption 2.1. Let X0, X1 be UMD Banach spaces with type 2 and X1  X0 densely. Assume that one of the following two settings is satisfied

p

(2, )

and





[0,

p 2

- 1);

· p = 2,  = 0 and X0, X1 are Hilbert spaces.

For   (0, 1) and p,  as above, we set

X := [X0, X1],

)1-

XpTr := X0T,rp.

Assumption 2.2. Let T  (0, ] and s  [0, T ). Assume that A : [s, T ] ×  
L (X1, X0) and B : [s, T ] ×   L (X1, (H, X1/2)) are strongly progressively measurable and there exists CA,B > 0 such that, a.s. for all t  [s, T ],

A(, t) L (X1,X0) + B(, t) L (X1,(H,X1/2))  CA,B < .

Stochastic maximal Lp-regularity is concerned with the optimal regularity estimate for the linear abstract stochastic Cauchy problem:

(2.1)

du(t) + A(t)u(t)dt = f (t)dt + (B(t)u(t) + g(t))dWH (t), t  [s, T ], u(s) = us.

Here WH denotes a H-cylindrical Brownian motion (see e.g. [AV21a, Definition 2.11]) on a filtered probability space (, A , (Ft)t0, P) and H is a separable Hilbert space. In order to define strong solutions to (2.1) let  be a stopping time such that s    T a.s. and let us  L0Fs (; X0), f  L0P(; L1(s,  ; X0)), g  L0P(; L2(s,  ; (H, X0))), where P denotes the progressive -algebra. A strongly progressive measurable map u : [s,  ] ×   X1 is said to be a strong solution to (2.1) on [s,  ] if u  L0(; L2(s,  ; X1)) and, a.s. for all t  [s,  ],

As in [AV21a], we define (weighted) stochastic maximal Lp-regularity.

Definition 2.3 (Stochastic maximal Lp-regularity). Let Assumptions 2.1 and 2.2 be satisfied. We write (A, B)  SMRp,(s, T ) if for every

f  LpP((s, T ) × , ws ; X0), and g  LpP((s, T ) × , ws ; (H, X1/2))
there exists a strong solution u to (2.1) with us = 0 such that u  LpP((s, T ) × , w; X1), and moreover for all stopping time  , such that s    T a.s., all strong solutions u  LpP((s,  ) × , ws ; X1) to (2.1) with us = 0 satisfy the estimate

u Lp((s, )×,w;X1)

f Lp((s, )×,ws ;X0) + g , Lp((s, )×,ws ;(H,X1/2))

where the implicit constant is independent of (f, g,  ). In addition:

f Lp((s,T )×,ws ;X0) + g , Lp((s,T )×,ws ;(H,X1/2))

where the implicit constant is independent of (f, g,  ). (2) If p = 2 and  = 0, then we say (A, B)  SMR·2,0(s, T ) if (A, B)  SMR2,0(s, T )
and there exists C > 0 such that

u L2(;C([s,T ];X1/2))

f L2((s,T )×;X0) + g L2((s,T )×;(H,X1/2)),

where the implicit constant is independent of (f, g,  ). We write SMR·p(s, T ) := SMR·p,0(s, T ) and A  SMR·p,(s, T ) if (A, 0)  SMR·p,(s, T ) and similarly if "·" is omitted.

Nonzero initial data can be considered as a consequence if stochastic maximal Lp-regularity and will therefore be omitted here (see [AV21a, Proposition 3.10]).
Examples of operators with stochastic maximal regularity appear in many places
in the literature, and we refer to the examples in [AV21a, Subsection 3.2] and refer-
ences therein. In Section 5 we present a general sufficient conditions for stochastic maximal regularity for second order operators with on Td and Rd.
Following [AV21a, AV21b], we introduce the solution operator Rs,(A,B) associated to the couple (A, B)  SMR·p,(s, T ) defined as

(2.2)

u := Rs,(A,B)(0, f, g)

STOCHASTIC MAXIMAL Lp(Lq)-REGULARITY

where u is the unique solution to (2.1). Then Rs,(A,B)(0, ·, ·) defines a mapping

Lp((s, T )×, ws ; X0)×Lp((s, T )×, ws ; (H, X1/2))  Lp(; H,p(s, T, ws ; X1-))

has

to

replace

H,p(s, T, ws ; X1-) by C([s, T ]; X1/2). For future convenience, let us define the

following constants

C(dAet,B,),p,(s, T ) := C(sAto,,B,)p,(s, T ) :=

Rs,(A,B)(0, f, 0) Lp((s,T )×,ws ;X0)Lp(;H,p(s,T,ws ;X1- )) Rs,(A,B)(0, 0, g) . Lp((s,T )×,ws ;X0)Lp(;H,p (s,T,ws ;X1- ))

Finally, for   {det, sto}, we set

(2.3)

K(A,,,Bp,)(s, T ) := C(A,,,Bp,)(s, T ) + C(A,0,,Bp,)(s, T ).

For later reference we collect some of the fundamental results on stochastic max-

imal Lp-regularity which will play a key role in the later subsections.

A sufficient condition for stochastic maximal Lp-regularity was obtained in [NVW12]

for  = 0.

argument. For a complete weighted theory we refer to [LV20a].

Theorem 2.4. Let the Assumption 2.1 be satisfied. Let X0 be isomorphic to a closed subspace of an Lq-space for some q  [2, ) and D(T ) = X1. Assume that there exists   R such that  + T has a bounded H-calculus of angle < /2. Then, for all 0  s < T < , T  SMR·p,(s, T ). If additionally T is invertible, then supT >s KT,,p,(s, T ) <  for   {det, sto}.
The following results will be employed several times and has been shown in [AV21a, Proposition 3.12 and Lemma 3.13], where one could replace SMR·p,(s, T ) by SMRp,(s, T ).
Proposition 2.5. Let (A, B)  SMR·p,(s, T ) and f  LpP ((s, T ) × , ws ; X0), and g  LpP((s, T ) × , ws ; (H, X1/2)),
and set u = Rs,(A,B)(0, f, g). Then for each stopping time  such that s    T a.s. and any strong solution v  LpP((s,  ) × , w; X1) to (2.1) the following holds. (1) v can be written as

v = u|[s, ] = Rs,(A,B)(0, 1[s, ]f, 1[s, ]g),

on [s,  ] × .

(2) There exists CT > 0 independent of (f, g) such that limt0 Ct = 0 and

v Lp((,T )×,ws ;X0)  CT ( f Lp((0,T )×,ws ;X0) + g Lp((,T )×,ws ;(H,X1/2))).

A simple but useful transference result (see [AV21a, Proposition 3.8]) shows that in most cases (A, B)  SMRp,(s, T ) self-improves to the stronger version with ·. To state the result we use the notation introduced in Assumption 2.2.

Proposition 2.6 (Transference). Let (A, B)  SMRp,(s, T ) and assume that there exists (A, B)  SMR·p,(s, T ). Then (A, B)  SMR·p,(s, T ) and

3. A perturbation result

Here and in the rest of this section, for the sake of brevity, for any   [0, 1] and

any stopping time  :   [s, T ], we set

(3.1)

E,(s,  ) = LpP((s,  ) × , ws ; X), E,(s,  ) = LpP((s,  ) × , ws ; (H, X)).

Before we state and prove our main perturbation result we provide a simple result which allows to reduce the question whether (A, B)  SMR·p,(s, T ) to the same question on a finite partition of (s, T ).

Proposition 3.1 (Partitions). Let Assumptions 2.1 and 2.2 be satisfied. Assume

that

there

exists

(A, B)  SMR·p,(s, T )

and

fix





(

1+ p

,

1 2

).

Let

s = s0

< s1

<

· · · < sN-1 < sN = T . Assume that for all j  {1, . . . , N - 1},

(A, B)  SMRp,(s, s1),

(A, B)  SMRp(sj , sj+1),

and let M > 0 be such that

max C(dAet,B,0),p,j (sj , sj+1), C(sAto,,B0,)p,j (sj , sj+1)  M where 0 :=  and j := 0 if j  1. Then (A, B)  SMR·p,(s, T ) and

(3.2)

C(A,0,,Bp,)(s,

T

)



C(N,

M,

(sj )Nj=1,

C ,,p, (s,
(A,B)

T

),

CA,B ),

for   {det, sto}.

Proof. We only prove the case p > 2, since the case p = 2 is simpler. As usual, we only consider s = 0. Let us recall that by [AV21b, Proposition 3.12],

(3.3)

(A, B)  SMR·p,(0, T )  SMR·p,(0, t)  SMR·p(t, T )

for all t  [0, T ]. Thus, by Proposition 2.6, it is enough to show that if (A, B)  SMR·p,(0, sn-1) for a given 2  n  N , then (A, B)  SMRp,(0, sn) and that (3.2) holds with s = 0 and T = sn. We content ourself to construct a unique strong solution un to (2.1) on [0, sn] with a corresponding estimate. The fact that each strong solution v to (2.1) on [0,  ] where  is a stopping time such that 0    sn, satisfies v = un|[0,] follows analogously.
Consider the problem (2.1) on [0, sn] with (see (3.1))

u0 = 0,

f  E0,(0, sn),

and

g  E1/2,(0, sn).

Since (A, B)  SMR·p,(0, sn-1), and [ALV21, Theorem 1.2], the right regularity holds at time sn-1, and thus there exists a unique strong solution un-1 to (2.1) on
[0, sn-1] such that

(3.4)

u + u n-1 E1,(0,sn-1)

n-1 Lp(;C([0,sn-1];XpTr))

f + g , E0,(0,sn-1)

E1/2, (0,sn-1 )

where the implicit constant depends on s1, n, (A, B), C(dAet,B,0),p,(0, sn-1), C(sAto,,B0,)p,(0, sn-1). By assumption, Proposition 2.6 and (3.3), one has (A, B)  SMR·p(sn-1, sn). Thus, by [AV21a, Proposition 3.10] we can consider nonzero initial values and by

(3.4), there exists a unique strong solution Un to the problem

dUn(t) + A(t)Un(t)dt = f (t)dt + (B(t)Un(t) + g(t))dWH (t), t  [s, sn], Un(sn-1) = un-1(sn-1),

STOCHASTIC MAXIMAL Lp(Lq)-REGULARITY

7

and

Un E1,0(sn-1,sn)

(3.5)

un-1(sn-1) + Lp(;XpTr) f + E0,0(sn-1,sn)

f + g . E0,(0,sn)

E1/2, (0,sn )

g E1/2,0(sn-1,sn)

Setting un := un-1 on [0, sn-1] and un := Un on (sn-1, sn], it follows that un is a strong solution to (2.1), and (3.2) follows from (3.4)-(3.5).

Let us conclude with a perturbation result which was announced in [AV21a]. A version with random initial times, but without lower order terms (i.e. LA = LB = 0) was given in [AV21b]. The perturbation result will be used in Section 5 to treat x-dependent coefficients.

Theorem 3.2 (Perturbation). Let Assumptions 2.1 and 2.2 be satisfied. Assume that (A, B)  SMR·p,(s, T ). Let A0 : [s, T ] ×   L (X1, X0), B0 : [s, T ] ×   L (X1, (H, X1/2)) be strongly progressively measurable such that for some positive constants CA, CB, LA, LB and for all x  X1, a.s. for all t  (s, T ),

A0(t, )x X0  CA x X1 + LA x X0 , B0(t, )x (H,X1/2)  CB x X1 + LB x X0 .

Fix





(

1+ p

,

1 2

).

Then

there

exists

 p, , X0, CA, CB, LA, LB, K(dAet,B,,)p,(s, T ), K(sAto,,B,)p,(s, T )  (0, 1)

such that if C(dAet,B,0),p,(s, T )CA + C(sAto,,B0,)p,(s, T )CB < ,
then (A + A0, B + B0)  SMR·p,(s, T ) and, for   {sto, det},

C(A,0+,pA,0,B+B0)(s, T )  C(p, , X0, CA, CB , LA, LB , K(dAet,B,,)p,(s, T ), K(sAto,,B,)p,(s, T )).

Proof. As usual, we set s = 0. It suffices to prove the result on a suitable partition by Proposition 3.1. The proof is divided into three steps.
Step 1: There exists s1, C1 > 0 depending only on p, , X0, CA, CB, LA, LB, C(dAet,B,0),p,(0, T ), C(sAto,,B0,)p,(0, T ) such that (A, B)  SMRp,(s1) and

C(dAet,B,0),p,(0, s1) + C(sAto,,B0,)p,(0, s1)  C1.

Let t  [0, T ] and let  :   [0, t] be a stopping time and let E,(0,  ) and E,(0,  ) be as in (3.1). To prove the required result we use a stochastic version of the method of continuity (see [AV21b, Proposition 3.13]). To this end, for   [0, 1], set A := A + A0, B := B + B0. Since  < 1, one has
 := 1 - C(dAet,B,0),p,(0, T )CA - C(sAto,,B0,)p,(0, T )CB > 0.

Let R := R0,(A,B) be the solution operator associated to (A, B). With the above choice of A, B and Proposition 2.5, any strong solution u  LpP((0,  ), w; X1) to

du(t) + Audt = f dt + (Bu + g)dWH , on [0,  ], u(0) = 0,

satisfies

u = R(0, 1[0,](f - A0u), 1[0,](g + B0u)),

on [0,  ].

8

ANTONIO AGRESTI AND MARK VERAAR

For notational convenience, we set v := R(0, 1[0,](f - A0u), 1[0,](g + B0u)) on [0, t]. Thus v|[0,] = u. Using stochastic maximal Lp-regularity and C(A,0,,Bp,)(0, t)  C(A,0,,Bp,)(0, T ) for t  T and   {det, sto}, we obtain (3.6)
u E1,(0, )  v E1,(0,t)
 C(dAet,B,0),p,(0, T ) f + A0u E0,(0, ) + C(sAto,,B0,)p,(0, T ) g + B0u E1/2,(0, )
 (1 - ) u E1,(0, ) + C(dAet,B,0),p,(0, T )LA + C(sAto,,B0,)p,(0, T )LB u E0,(0, )
+ C(dAet,B,0),p,(0, T ) f E0,(0, ) + C(sAto,,B0,)p,(0, T ) g . E1/2,(0, )

To estimate u E0,(0,) note that by [AV21a, Lemma 3.13]

(3.7)

u E0,(0, )  c(t) f - A0u E0,(0, ) + g + B0u E1/2,(0, )  C(t) u E1,(0, ) + f E0,(0, ) + g E1/2,(0, )

where c(t) and C(t) depend only on p, X0, , CA, CB, LA, LB, CA,B and satisfy

limt0 c(t) = limt0 C(t) = 0. Choosing s1 > 0 such that

C(dAet,B,0),p,(0, T )LA + C(sAto,,B0,)p,(0, T )LB

C(s1) <

Combining (3.6) and (3.7) we find the a priori estimate

As the latter is uniform in   [0, 1], the result follows from the method of continuity

X0, CA, CB, LA, LB, C(dAet,B,0),p,(0, T ) C(sAto,,B0,)p,(0, T ) such that for each t  [s1, T ) one has (A, B)  SMRp(t, t) with t := min{t + s, T } and

max C(dAet,B,0),p,0(t, t), C(sAto,,B0,)p,0(t, t)  C. Note that by [AV21b, Proposition 3.12], for all   {det, sto} and all t > t

C(A,0,,Bp,)0(t, t)  (T /s1)/pC(A,0,,Bp,)(0, T ).

Setting  := (s1/T )/p, the previous estimate gives

(3.8)

C(dAet,B,0),p,0(t, t)CA + C(sAto,,B0,)p,0(t, t)CB < 1.

Up to a translation argument, the claim of this step follows by repeating the argu-
ment in Step 1 with  = 0 and (3.8). Step 3: Conclusion. Let s1 and s > 0 be as in Step 1 and 2, respectively.
The claim follows from Steps 1-2 and Proposition 3.1 by setting (A, B) = (A, B), sj := min{s1 + js, T } for j  2 and choosing N  N such that s1 + N s > T .

4. Pointwise multiplication
For the proofs in Section 5 we need a result on pointwise multiplication in Bessel potential spaces. A standard reference for such results is [RS96]. Some extensions to the vector-valued setting can be found in [MV15, Theorem 5.10]. In case of positive smoothness the results below are well-known (see [Tay00, Proposition 1.1, Chapter 2]). The results for negative smoothness seem to be new.

Proposition 4.1. Let H a Hilbert space, and let O either be Rd, Rd+, Td, or a bounded Lipschitz domain. Let s > 0, q  (1, ) and   (s, ). Then the
following estimates hold whenever the right-hand side is finite:

(1) f g Hs,q(O;H)

f Hs,q1 (O) g Lq2 (O;H)+ g Hs,r1 (O;H) f Lr2(O) provided q1, r1

f Hs,q(O) g L(O;H) + g C (O;H) f Lq(O);

(3) f g H-s,q(O;H)

f H-s,q(O) g L(O;H) + g H,(O;H) f H-s-,q(O) provided

 (q, )

and

only

on

(d, q, s, , );

(4) f g H-s,q(O;H)

f H-s,q(O) g L(O;H) + g C (O;H) f , H-s-,q(O) where  

(0,  - s) is arbitrary.

The point in (3) and (4) is to find some  > 0 for which the stated estimate holds. Later on this will be enough to treat the term f H-s-,q(O) as a lower order perturbation in localization arguments. The admissible values of  can be obtained from the proof below. Finally, we note that one can also take f to be H-valued and g scalar-valued in the result and proof below. Moreover, one can even take f and g both H-valued if one replaces f g by the inner-product (f, g)H .

Proof. Since there exists a universal extension operator for O, it suffices to consider

O = Rd. For details on extension operators we refer to [Ste70, VI.3] in the integer

case. The non-integer case can be obtained by complex interpolation or by using

[Ryc99] and the standard fact that Fps,2 = Hs,p. All these results extend to the Hilbert space-valued setting with only minor modifications. In the proof below we

use the notations of [Tay00] for Bony's paraproducts. Let (j )j0 be a Littlewood-

Paley partition of the unity [Tay00, p. 4] and, for any k  N, set k :=

k j=0

j .

Then k = 0(2-k·). For any f  S, set j(D)f := F -1(j (·)F (f )) where F

denotes the Fourier transform on Rd. Then, for any f, g  S, Bony's decomposition

of the product is given by f g := Tf g + R(f, g) + Tgf , where

Tf g := k-5(D)f k+1(D)g,
k5

R(f, g) =

j(D)f k(D)g,

|j-k|4

whenever these series converge in S. The operator Tf g is called Bony's paraproduct. The above extends to the case either f or g is in S(Rd; H). Moreover, by replacing the product by inner products in H one can also define (f, g)H in S(Rd) whenever the appropriate series converge in S(Rd). All result below have versions for these situations, and we will need this in the duality argument in the proofs of (3) and (4).
(1): This follows from [Tay00, Proposition 1.1, Chapter 2]. Actually only the case H = R is considered there, but the extension to the Hilbert space-valued setting is straightforward. In particular, note that Littlewood­Paley type estimates also hold in this setting, replacing the absolute values in the square functions by the norms
· H. (2): This can be proved in a similar way as (1). It suffices to bound each of the terms in the paraproduct. To indicate the required change we recall from (see [Tri83, Theorem 2.5.7(6)] and [Tri95, Theorem 2.7.2.1]) that

where in the last inequality we used [HNVW16, Proposition 2.3.9 and Theorem
2.3.2]. With  = 0 and s +   (s,  ] \ N, the remaining estimate for (2) follows. (3): For this we use a duality argument. Note that S(Rd; H) is dense in Ht,q
and (H-t,q) = Ht,q for all t  R and q  (1, ) (see [HNVW16, Propositions
5.6.4 and 5.6.7] for the vector-valued case). By approximation it suffices to consider f  S(Rd). Let h  S(Rd; H) and g  H,(Rd; H) and note that H,  L by
Sobolev embeddings. Bony's decomposition yields

(4.4) | f g, h | = | f, (g, h)H |  | f, Tgh | + | f, R(g, h) | + | f, Thg |,

where we need the analogues of Tg, Th and R where inner products are taken into account. By applying (4.2) we find

(4.5)

| f, Tgh | + | f, R(g, h) |  f H-s,q Tgh + Hs,q R(g, h) Hs,q

f g h . H-s,q

L (Rd ;H )

Hs,q (Rd;H)

Since | f, Thg | f H-s-,q Thg Hs+,q for all  > 0, it remains to prove

(4.6)

T gh Hs+,q

h g Hs,q (Rd;H)

H, (Rd;H)

where  > 0 depends solely on s, , . Indeed, if (4.6) holds, then inserting (4.5)(4.6) in (4.4), we obtain

| f g, h | ( f H-s,q g L(Rd;H) + f H-s-,q g ) H, (Rd;H) h . Hs,q (Rd;H)
By taking the supremum over all h  S(Rd; H) with h Hs,q (Rd;H)  1, the estimate in (3) follows by density and duality.
To prove (4.6) we will use the following estimation:

(4.2)

()

T g  h g  h g . h Hs+,q

Lq1 (Rd;H)

Hs+,q2 (Rd;H)

Hs,q (Rd;H)

Note that the first condition in (4.7) is equivalent to s  d/q2. Since we assumed

In

order

to find parameters (, q2) for which (4.7) holds, we consider two cases.

Case   d/s. Let   (0,  - s) be arbitrary and set q2 =  +  with  > 0 arbitrary but fixed and will be chosen below. Then (i) and (ii) of (4.7) hold, and

(iii)

is

Let

Then

(i),

of

(4): The proof follows as in the previous step, where the following variant of

(4.6) should be used:

T gh Hs+,q(Rd) where we also used (4.3).

g C h Lq (Rd;H)

g C (Rd;H) h , Hs,q (Rd;H)

As a consequence of Proposition 4.1(1) we obtain:

Corollary 4.2. Let H a Hilbert space, and let O either be Rd, Rd+, Td, or a bounded

Lipschitz domain. Let s  (0, ) and q  (1, ). Suppose that   (1, q] and   s

satisfy

such

that

(f g Hs,q(O;H)

f Hs,q g L(O;H) + f Hs-,q g H,(O;H)

whenever the right-hand side is finite.

Proof. As before it suffices to consider O = Rd. Due to Proposition 4.1(1) for all

such

that

one

has

Therefore, to prove the claim it remains to show that

(4.8) H,(Rd; H)  Hs, (Rd; H) and Hs-,q  L for some  > 0

where ,  will be suitably chosen. To prove (4.8) we apply Sobolev embedding and

split into two cases.

5. Main result
Below we gives sufficient conditions for stochastic maximal regularity for systems of second order operators on the torus Td = [-1/2, 1/2]d. It is the first result on Lp( × (0, T ), H,q(Td))-theory with coefficients which are measurable in time and , and Ho¨lder continuous in space. The flexibility to have p, q  2 and   R arbitrary, is highly relevant for the applications to nonlinear SPDEs (see [AV21a, AV21b]).

5.1. Assumptions. Consider the following linear parabolic system on Td:

(5.1)

du - Audt = f dt + n1(Bnu + gn)dwtn, on Td,

u(s) = 0,

on Td,

where s  [0, T ), m, d  N and for each sufficiently smooth u = (uk)m k=1,

(5.2)

d

A(t)u :=

i(ai,j (t, ·)ju) or A(t)u :=

ai,j (t, ·)ij u,

i,j=1

i,j=1

Bn(t)u :=

d
bjk,n(t, ·)j uk
j=1

m k=1

for all n  1, t  (s, T ). Lower order terms can be added without difficulty af-
terwards by the perturbation results of Theorem 3.2. Moreover, using a minor
modification of (4) below, complex coefficient can be allowed as well (see [PV19,
Assumption 5.2(2)]). A natural question is whether the diagonal structure on the
operator B can be relaxed. In general this is not the case as follows from a counterexample in [KL13]. Finally, (wtn : t  0)n1 denotes a sequence of standard Brownian motions on a filtered probability (, A , (Ft)t0, P). By [AV21a, Example 2.12] this naturally determines a W2 -cylindrical Brownian motion.
Consider the following assumption in the case of a divergence form operators.

Assumption 5.1. Let m, d  N,   R and 0  s < T < .

(1) Let one of the following be satisfied:

·

q

 [2, ),

p  (2, )

and





[0,

p 2

-

1);

· p = q = 2 and  = 0.

(2) For each i, j  {1, . . . , d} and   {1, . . . , m}, the maps ai,j := (aik,,jh)m k,h=1 :

[0, T ] ×  × Td  Rm×m, bj,n : [0, T ] ×  × Td  R are P  B(Td)-measurable.

(3) There exist Ca,b > 0,  > |1+| such that a.s. for all t  (s, T ), i, j  {1, . . . , d},

  {1, . . . , m},

ai,j (t, ·) + C(Td;Rm×m) (bj,n(t, ·))nN C(Td;2)  Ca,b.

(4) Let i,j be the m × m-dimensional diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements

are

given

by

(

1 2

n1 bj,nbi,n)m =1. There exists  > 0 such that a.s. for all

t  [0, T ], x  Td,   Rm and   Rd,

d
[(ai,j(t, x) - i,j(t, x))] ·  ij  ||2||2.
i,j=1
In the case A is in non-divergence form, the only required change is that instead of (3) we assume
(3)' There exist Ca,b > 0,  > |1 + | and  > || such that a.s. for all t  (s, T ), i, j  {1, . . . , d},   {1, . . . , m},
ai,j (t, ·) + C(Td;Rm×m) (bj,n(t, ·))nN C(Td;2)  Ca,b.
For notational convenience we write Hs,q and Bqs,p instead of Hs,q(Td; Rm) and Bqs,p(Td; Rm) below. Let
X0 = H,q and X1 = H2+,q.

Then

X = H 2+

and

B . 2+-

2(1+) p

q,p

If p = q = 2 and  = 0, and X0T,r2 = H1+,2. For (A, B) as in (5.2), we set

(A, B) : [0, T ] ×   L (H2+,q, H,q × H1+,q(2)),

(A, B)u := (Au, (Bnu)n1),

u  H 2+,q,

and similarly for (A, B). Here H1+,q(2) := H1+,q(Td; 2). The couples (A, B)
and (A, B) are well-defined and actually satisfy Assumption 2.2 with C(A,B)  C(q, p, , d, m). Indeed, by Assumption 5.1 and Proposition 4.1(2),(4) and [HNVW17, Proposition 9.3.1] it follows that for all v  H2+,q,

Av + H,q (Bnv)n1 (2,H1+,q)

max
i,j

ai,j v + H1+,q

(Bnv)n1 H1+,q(2)

Ca,b v , H2+,q

where the spaces take values in Rm. The required measurability follows from the progressively measurability of the coefficients ai,j and bjk,n, where for the -valued case one can use [NVW07, Lemma 2.5].

5.2. Statements of the main results. Next we state our main results on sto-
chastic maximal regularity for these operators. Equivalently we could just write (A, B)  SMR·p,(s, T ) (see Definition 2.3) below, and write the estimates by referring to the constants K(A,B) in (2.3). However, to make the theorems more accessible we write out the definitions. Below we only consider trivial initial
values, but as a consequence of [AV21a, Proposition 3.10], initial values us  LpFs (; Bq2,+p-2(1+)/p) can be added as well. Note that Theorem 1.2 is a special case of the result below.

Theorem 5.2 (Divergence form). Suppose that Assumption 5.1 holds. Then for each s  [0, T ), and each progressively measurable f  Lp( × (s, T ), ws ; H,q), and g  Lp( × (s, T ), ws ; H1+,q(2)) there exists a unique strong solution u to (5.1). Moreover, letting

Jp,q,(f, g) := f + Lp(×(s,T ),ws ;H,q) g , Lp(×(s,T ),ws ;H1+,q(2))

the following results hold, where the constants Ci do not depend on (s, f, g):

  [0, 1/2),   (s, T ).

(2) in case p = q = 2 (and thus  = 0),

u L2(;L2(s,T ;H2+,2))  C5J2,2,0(f, g), u L2(;C([s,T ];H1+,2))  C6J2,2,0(f, g).

14

ANTONIO AGRESTI AND MARK VERAAR

From the proof it is clear that Ci only depends on q, p, , , d, m, , Ca,b, T , and additionally on  and  if this is written explicitly. One can use (weighted) Sobolev embedding to deduce Ho¨lder regularity from the above theorem:

0 H ,p(s,

respectively.

The following variant holds in the non-divergence case:

Theorem 5.3 (Non-divergence form). Suppose that Assumption 5.1 with (3) replaced by (3)'. Then for each s  [0, T ) the same assertions as in Theorem 5.2 hold if (A, B) is replaced by (A, B).

In principle our proof is self-contained, but we do rely on the results for constant coefficients in space [PV19, Theorem 5.3]. Besides the fact that Theorems 5.2 and 5.3 are more general, the proof below is also simpler in the sense that we can completely avoid the case  = 0 in [PV19, Lemmas 5.5-5.7 and step 2 of Theorem 5.4] which was needed for the optimal mixed space-time smoothness. Instead we rely on the transference result of Proposition 2.6.
A key step in the proof of Theorem 5.2 is the following a priori estimate on small time intervals.

Lemma 5.4. Let Assumption 5.1 be satisfied. Then there exists T , C > 0 depend-

ing only on q, p, , , d, m, , Ca,b for which the following holds:

For any t  [s, T ],   {0, }, any stopping time  :   [t, T  (t + T )],

any f  solution

LpP u

(L(tpP, ()(t×, ) ,×wt;,Xw0t);,Xg1)tLo pP(5(.(1t),

 ) × , on [t, 

wt; (H, X1/2)) ] one has

and

any

strong

(5.3) u Lp((t, )×,wt;X1)  C( f Lp((t, )×,wt;X0) + g Lp((t, )×,wt;(H,X1/2))).

The same assertion holds in the non-divergence case if Assumption 5.1(3) is replaced

by (3)'.

We first show how Theorems 5.2 and 5.3 can be derived from the above lemma.

Proof of Theorems 5.2 and 5.3. All assertions would follow if we can show that (A, B)  SMR·p,(0, T ). Indeed, all assertions follow from the definitions except the maximal inequalities which are a direct consequence of (A, B)  SMR·p,(0, T ) and the trace embedding in [ALV21, Theorem 1.2].
By the periodic version of [HNVW17, Theorem 10.2.25], - : H2+,q  H,q  H,q has a bounded H-calculus of angle < /2. Hence Theorem 2.4 implies that -  SMR·p,(T ) for all T < . Therefore, by Proposition 2.6 it is enough to prove that (A, B)  SMRp,(0, T ).
By Proposition 3.1 it suffices to prove (A, B)  SMRp,(t, t + T ) for all t  [0, T - T ], where T  is as in Lemma 5.4 and   {0, }. To show this we apply
the method of continuity (see [AV21b, Proposition 3.13]). Fix a stopping time  :   [t + t  T ] and let u  LpP((t,  ) × , wt; X1) be a strong solution to (5.1) with (A, B) replaced by

Au = Au + (1 - )u, and Bn,u = Bnu,
where   [0, 1] is fixed. By the method of continuity it suffices to prove the a priori estimate (5.3). Since (A, B) satisfies Assumption 5.1 (uniformly in ), the required a priori estimate follows from Lemma 5.4, and thus the theorem follows.

STOCHASTIC MAXIMAL Lp(Lq)-REGULARITY

15

In the next remark we discuss several situations in which the regularity conditions on the coefficients a and b can be weakened, and under which the assertions of Theorems 5.2 and 5.3 still remain valid.

Remark 5.5. In special integer cases of  one can check from Steps 2 and 5 of
the proof of Lemma 5.4 that the Ho¨lder condition of Assumption 5.1(3) can be weakened. The proof always requires the existence of a   C([0, )) such that (0) = 0 and for all t  [s, T ], x, x  Td, i, j  {1, . . . , d}, k  {1, . . . , m},

ai,j (t, x) - ai,j (t, x) + Rm×m (bjk,n(t, x) - bjk,n(t, x))nN 2  (|x - x|). Below we indicate which additional assumption are needed in particular cases:

· divergence case,  = -1: there exist Ca,b > 0,  > 0, a.s. for all t  [0, T ], i, j  {1, . . . , d}, k  {1, . . . , m},

ai,j(t, ·) + C(Td;Rm×m) (bjk,n(t, x))nN 2  Ca,b.
· divergence case,  = 0: there exist Ca,b > 0, a.s. for all t  [0, T ], x, x  Td, i, j, k  {1, . . . , d}, k  {1, . . . , m}, r  {0, 1},

krai,j (t, x) + Rm×m (krbjk,n(t, x))nN 2  Ca,b.

· non-divergence,   N0: there exist Ca,b > 0, a.s. for all t  [0, T ], i, j, k  {1, . . . , d}, k  {1, . . . , m}, r  {0, . . . , },

krai,j (t, x) + Rm×m (krbjk,n(t, x))nN 2  Ca,b.

Remark 5.6. By Proposition 4.1(3) and Corollary 4.2 one can check that Steps 2 and
5 of the proof of Lemma 5.4 still hold under the following regularity assumptions on bjk,n, which are weaker than Assumption 5.1(3). The case  = -1 was already discussed in Remark 5.5 above.

some  > 0. Moreover, if  > -1, then the threshold case q =  and  = 1 + 

is allowed. Note that in the proof of Lemma 5.4 in the above setting an extension

of Lemma 5.8 to Bessel potential spaces is needed. The latter can be obtained by interpolation from the same type of lemma for Sobolev spaces W 1,q with q  [1, ].

Remark 5.7. The results of Theorems 5.2 and 5.3 also hold if Td is replaced by a

compact smooth d-dimensional manifold without boundary, and the proof extends

almost verbatim. Theorems 5.2 and 5.3 also hold if Td is replaced by Rd if the coefficients be-

come constant for |x|  . More precisely we require that there exist progressive measurable ai,j : [s, T ] ×   Rm×m and bjk,n : [s, T ]  R such that

Note that this condition can be avoided if p = q see [Kry99, Theorem 5.1] for the case m = 1, and for an alternative approach [PV19, Theorem 5.4] which additionally holds in the case m  1.

5.3. Proof of Lemma 5.4. Before we prove Lemma 5.4 we first state a simple extension result.

Lemma 5.8. Let   (0, N ], O  {Rd, Td} and let X be a Banach space. Then,

for

any

y



O

and

any

r



(0,

1 8

)

there

exists

an

extension

operator

EOy,r : C(BO(x, r); X)  C(O; X)

which satisfies the following properties:
(1) EOy,rf |BO(y,r) = f , EOx,rc  c for any f  C(BO (y, r); X) and c  X; (2) EOy,r L (C(BO(y,r);X),C(O;X))  Cr for some Cr independent of y; (3) EOy,r L (C(BO(y,r);X),C(O;X))  C for some C independent of y, r.

Proof. Step 1: The case O = Rd. Note that by localization and the well-known
extension operator [Lun09, Example 1.9 and discussion below it], one can check that there exists a bounded linear operator E : C(BRd (1)); E  C(Rd; E) such
that Ef L(Rd;E)  C f L(B(1);E), Ec = c for any c  R, and Ef |BRd (1) = f for any f  C(BRd (1)). Let   Cc(Rd) be radially symmetric and such that 0    1, |BRd (1) = 1 and |Rd\BRd (2) = 0. For any f  C(BRd (1); X), set

(ER0,d1f )(x) := (x)Ef (x) + (1 - (x))f (0),

x  Rd.

Then ER0,d1f = f (0) on Rd \ BRd (2) is constant. Setting

ERy,drf (x) = ER0,d1[f (y + r·)]

x-y r

,

x  Rd,

one can check that ERy,dr has the desired properties. Step 2: The case O = Td. We identity the torus with [-1/2, 1/2]d. Fix y  Td
and set ETy,dr(f )(x) := ER0,dr(f (· + y))((x - y) mod1), x  Td,
where we set (z mod1)j = zj mod1  (-1/2, 1/2] for z  Rd. It remains to check that ETy,dr satisfies the required properties. Note that distTd (x, y) = |(x - y) mod1|, and the function x  (x - y)mod1 is smooth on the torus. Therefore, EyT,dr inherits the required properties from ERy,dr. For instance, if distTd (x, y) > 2r, then ETy,dr(f )(x) = f (y).

Next we turn to the proof of Lemma 5.4.

Proof of Lemma 5.4. We will only prove the divergence form case, since the non-
divergence form case is completely analogues. For notational convenience we set s = 0. Let T  > 0 be arbitrary but fixed. It will be chosen below in Step 5.
Fix t  [0, T ],   {0, }, a stopping time  :   [t, T  (t + T )], f  LpP((t,  ) × , wt; X0) and g  LpP((t,  ) × , wt; (2, X1/2)) and we set

(5.4)

Nf,g(t,  ) := f Lp((t, )×,wt;X0) + g . Lp((t, )×,wt;(H,X1/2))

STOCHASTIC MAXIMAL Lp(Lq)-REGULARITY

Moreover,

for

any

y



Td,

r



(0,

),

set

B(y,

r)

:=

BTd (y,

r)

and

for

(ETy,dr(bjk,n(t, ·))j )vk

m
,
k=1

where ETy,dr is the extension operator of Lemma 5.8. Comparing the previous definitions with (5.2), one sees that Ay, By are the operators with "frozen coefficient at y  Td" and AEy,r, ByE,r are the operators whose coefficients are the extensions of ai,j |B(y,r), bjn|B(y,r).
To abbreviate the dependencies let S := {q, p, , d, , , , Ca,b} and we write
C(S) instead of C below. Step 1: There exists C1(S) > 0 such that for each t  [0, T ), and y  Td, one
has (Ay, By)  SMR·p,(t, T ) and

max{K(sAtoy,0,B,py,)(t, T ), K(dAety,,0B,py,)(t, T )}  C1.

Since the coefficients of Ay, By are x-independent, this follows from the periodic variant of [PV19, Theorem 5.3 and Remark 4.6]. Moreover, inspecting the proofs

of these results one can check that the constants can be taken independent of t.

Step 2: There exists (S) > 0 for which the following holds:

If

y



Td

and

r



(0,

1 8

)

satisfy

aik,,jh(t, ·) - aik,,jh(t, y) L(B(y,r)) + (bjk,n(t, ·) - bjk,n(t, y))n1 L(B(y,r);2)  

a.s. for all t  [0, T ], i, j  {1, . . . , d}, then (AEy,r, ByE,r)  SMR·p,(t, T ) and

max{K(sAtoEy,,0r,,pB,yE,r )(t,

T

),

K det,0,p,
(AEy,r ,ByE,r

)

(t,

T

)}



C2 (S ).

The idea is to apply Theorem 3.2. To this end, we write

AEy,r = Ay + (AEy,r - Ay),

ByE,r = By + (ByE,r - By).

Let  > 0 be as in Proposition 4.1. Then for each u  H2+,q,

i,j=1 k,h=1

(aik,,jh(t, y) - ETy,dr(aik,,jh(t, ·)))j uh

We estimate each of the latter terms separately:

(ai,j (t, y) - ETy,dr(ai,j (t, ·)))j u H1+,q

(=i) ETy,dr ai,j (t, y) - ai,j (t, ·) j u H1+,q

H1+,q (2)

where H1+,q(2) = H1+,q(Td; 2). Each of the terms can be estimated as before,

by using Proposition 4.1(2) and (4) again.

Step 3: Let  be as in step 2. There exist an integer   1, (y)=1  Td,

(r)=1

depending

only

on

the

quantities

in

S,

such

that

Td



=1 B ,

where B := BTd (y, r), and a.s. for all t  [0, T ], i, j  {1, . . . , d},

aik,,jh(t, y) - aik,,jh(t, ·) L(B) + (bjk,n(t, y) - bjk,n(t, ·))n1 L(B;2) < .

In particular, for all   {1, . . . , } and all t  [0, T )

(AE , BE) := (AEx,r , BxE,r )  SMR·p,(t, T ),
and max{K(dAetE,0,B,pE,)(t, T ), K(sAtoE,0,B,pE,)(t, T )}  C3(S). The last claim follows from the first one and Step 2. To prove the first claim, fix
y  Td. Note that

aik,,jh(t, y)-aik,,jh(t, ·) L(B(y,r)) + (bjk,n(t, y) - bjk,n(t, ·))n1 L(B(y,r);2)
 [aik,,jh(t, ·)]C(B(y,r)) + [(bjk,n(t, ·))n1]C(B(y,r);2) r  C,qCa,b r < ,

where the last inequality follows by choosing r := min

 C,q Ca,b

1/,

, which

only depends on S. Since Td can be covered by finitely many balls of the form

B(y, r) with y  Td, the claim of Step 3 follows.

Step 4: A representation formula for u. Let ()=1 be a partition of unity

subordinated 

to

the

covering

(B )=1 .

Multiplying

(5.1)

by

,

one

obtains

du - Audt = ([, A]u + f)dt

(5.5)

u(t) = 0,

+ n1(Bnu + [, Bn]u + gn,)dwtn, on Td, on Td,

where u := u, f := f , gn, := gn and [·, ·] denotes the commutator. Since supp (u)  B, one has Au = AE u, Bnu = BnE,u. By (5.5), Proposition 2.5(1), and (AE , BE)  SMR·p,(t, T ) (see Step 3), one gets
u = R(0, [A, ]u, -[Bn, ]u) + R(0, f, (gn,)n1), a.e. on [0,  ],
where R := R0,(AE,BE) is the solution operator associated to the couple (AE , BE), see (2.2). Therefore, a.e. on [t,  ],





(5.6) u = R(0, [, A]u, ([, Bn]u)n1) + R(0, f, (gn,)n1).

Step 5: Conclusion. A straightforward calculation shows that [, A]u X0 can be estimated by a linear combination of terms of the form aikj,h(j )uh H1+,q

and (i)aikj,hj uh . H,q Since aikj,h  C with  > |1 + |, Proposition 4.1(2) and (4) imply

For the second term in case   -1 choose   (0, 1] such that  > - - 1 + . Then

The same estimate holds in case  > -1, using   (0, min{1 + , 1}). Similarly since bjk  C(Td; 2),

dm j=1 k=1

(bk,n(j )uk)n1

H1+,q (2)

u . X1/2

From (5.6) and Step 3 it follows that

u Lp((t, )×,wt;X1) S T1 + T2 + Nf,g (t,  ), where Nf,g(t,  ) is as in (5.4), and

T1 := max
{1,...,}

T2 := max
{1,...,}

([, Bn]u)n1

Lp((t, )×,wt;(2,X1/2))

S u , Lp((t, )×,wt;X1/2)

for some (q, , d)  (0, 1]. Thus by standard interpolation inequalities (see [HNVW16,

(C.1)]), Holder's and Young's inequality there exists a constant C5(S) > 0 such that

(5.7)

u

Lp((t, )×,wt;X1)



1 4

u

Lp((t, )×,wt;X1) + C5

u Lp((t, )×,wt;X0) + Nf,g(t,  ) ,

To obtain the desired estimate we will use that   (t + T )  T and choose T 

small enough. Indeed, due to the first statement in [AV21a, Lemma 3.13], there

exists constants (cs(S))s>0 independent of t such that lims0 cs = 0 and

(5.8)

u Lp((t, )×,wt;X0)  cT  ( u Lp((t, )×,wt;X1) + Nf,g(t,  )).

By

choosing

T

so

small

that

cT

combining

(5.7)

and

(5.8)

it

follows

that

This completes the proof.
