## Abstract

We develop a non-perturbative analysis of the electro-production of heavy vector mesons ($\phi$, $J/\Psi$) from threshold to high energy. We use the holographic construction with bulk confinement enforced through a soft wall. Using Witten diagrams, we evaluate the pertinent cross sections for heavy vector mesons ($\phi$, $J/\Psi$) production and study their dependence on both the incoming virtual photon polarization as well as the outgoing polarization of the heavy meson. Our results for $J/\Psi$ electro-production compares well with the available HERA data at low and intermediate $Q^2$, and for a wide range of momentum transfer. We also predict the quasi-real electro-production of $J/\Psi$ near threshold.
