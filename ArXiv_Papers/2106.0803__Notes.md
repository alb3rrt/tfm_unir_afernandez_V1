## Abstract

We use Lefschetz pencil methods to derive structural results about Fukaya categories of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces; in particular, concerning their dependence on the Novikov parameter. Warning to the reader: the arguments in this paper cite two preprints (papers 6.5 and 7 in the series) which do not at present exist. Until that is remedied, the proofs cannot be considered complete, and this paper should be regarded as a preliminary research announcement.
