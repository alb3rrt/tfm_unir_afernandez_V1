## Abstract

Recent advances in smart grid technologies bring opportunities to better control the modern and complex power grids with renewable integration. The operation of power systems, especially distribution network (DN), is facing with preeminent challenges from cyber-physical-human (CPH) threats and natural disasters. In order to provide better response against threats and improve the resilience of power grid, proactive plans and operational schemes are required by system operators to minimize the damages caused by CPH threats. To that end, this paper proposes a proactive plan for DN operation by using hydrogen (H2) systems to enhance the resilience through cost-effective long-term energy storage. Unlike batteries, H2 energy can be stored in the storage tanks days before the extreme event, and transformed into power by fuel cell units in the post-event time to reduce load curtailment caused by CPH threats. The proposed framework is validated by testing on 33-node test feeder. Simulation results demonstrate that H2 systems can improve the resilience of DN during $N-m$ outages lasting for more than 10 hours.
