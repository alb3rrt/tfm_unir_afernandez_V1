## Abstract

We characterize the maximal discrete subgroups of $SO^+(2,n+2)$, which contain the discriminant kernel of an even lattice, which contains two hyperbolic planes over $\mathbb{Z}$. They coincide with the normalizers in $SO^+(2,n+2)$ and are given by the group of all integral matrices inside $SO^+(2,n+2)$, whenever the underlying lattice is maximal even. Finally we deal with the irreducible root lattices as examples.
