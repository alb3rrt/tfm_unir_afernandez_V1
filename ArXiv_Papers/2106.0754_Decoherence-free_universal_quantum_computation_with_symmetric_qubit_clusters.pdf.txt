One of the most challenging problems for the realization of a scalable quantum computer is to design a physical device that keeps the error rate for each quantum processing operation low. These errors can originate from the accuracy of quantum manipulation, such as the sweeping of a gate voltage in solid state qubits or the duration of a laser pulse in optical schemes. Errors also result from decoherence, which is often regarded as more crucial in the sense that it is inherent to the quantum system, being fundamentally a consequence of the coupling to the external environment.
Grouping small collections of qubits into clusters with symmetries may serve to protect parts of the calculation from decoherence. In this work, we use 4-level cores with a straightforward generalization of discrete rotational symmetry, called -rotation invariance, to encode pairs of coupled qubits and universal 2-qubit logical gates. We propose a scalable scheme for universal quantum computation where cores play the role of quantum-computational transistors, or quansistors for short.
Embedding in the environment, initialization and readout are achieved by tunnel-coupling the quansistor to leads. The external leads are explicitly considered and are assumed to be the main source of decoherence. We show that quansistors can be dynamically decoupled from the leads by tuning their internal parameters, giving them the versatility required to act as controllable quantum memory units. With this dynamical decoupling, logical operations within quansistors are also symmetry-protected from unbiased noise in their parameters. We identify technologies that could implement -rotation invariance. Many of our results can be generalized to higher-level -rotation-invariant systems, or adapted to clusters with other symmetries.

I. INTRODUCTION

Quantum information theory has become a mature field of research over the last three decades, equipped with its own objectives towards quantum computation

2

and communication [1], as well as quantum simulation [2], while at the same time allowing entirely novel perspectives on other established fields, in particular an algorithmic approach to quantum systems, a structureof-entanglement characterization of large classes of manybody quantum states (matrix product states, tensor networks) [3], and quantum-enhanced measurements reaching the Heisenberg precision limit (quantum metrology) [4].

Quantum information processing departed from its

classical counterpart with the proof that two-qubit

gates [5], and even single-qubit gates [6], can simulate

arbitrary unitary matrices, followed by the identification

of `simple' quantum universal sets like single-qubit gates

with CNOT [7], and finite quantum universal sets like

Toffoli

with

Hadamard

and

 4

-gate

[8],

or

SWAP

with

al-

most any two-qubit gate [9, 10]. The deep theorem of

Solovay and Kitaev showed that it is possible to trans-

late between strictly universal sets with at most polylog-

arithmic overhead [8, 11]. Alongside strict universality,

encoded universality [12, 13] and computational univer-

sality [14] allow even more systems to qualify as universal

quantum computers, although the Solovay-Kitaev theo-

rem does not automatically apply.

Circumstantial evidence suggests that quantum computers might achieve superpolynomial speedups over probabilistic classical ones. Lloyd's universal quantum simulator and Shor's algorithms for integer factorization and for discrete logarithms are prominent examples of efficient quantum solutions for problems suspected to be not computable in polynomial time classically [15, 16]. Quantum communication protocols are provably exponentially faster than classical-probabilistic ones for specific communication complexity problems [17, 18], and there exist problems that space-bounded quantum algorithms can solve using exponentially less work space than any classical algorithm [19]. Nonetheless, large classes of quantum tasks involving highly entangled states are efficiently simulatable classically. Quantum teleportation, superdense coding and computation using only Hadamard, CNOT, and measurements fall into this category according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem [1, 20]. Fermionic linear optics with measurements, and more generally matchgate computation, are also known to be classically simulatable in polynomial time [21­23]. (This is in contrast to universal bosonic linear optics with measurements [24] and universal fermionic nonlinear optics with measurements [25]. The computationally relevant difference between particle-number-preserving fermions and bosons being the easy task of computing a (Slater) determinant versus the hard task ( P-complete) of computing a permanent [26].)

The physical realization of quantum computers and quantum communication channels is a major endeavor. Most building blocks of quantum computers are based on qubits, which are quantum two-level systems. They form the unit cells that allow us to unleash the power of quantum information processing, when many of these qubits

are coherently coupled and manipulated so as to perform various coherent quantum operations. While many different types of qubits have been developed, such as semiconductor technologies in quantum dots [27], including silicon [28, 29], or GaAs [30], in superconducting technologies [31, 32], in all optical technologies [33], and in hybrid technologies such as ion traps [34], cold atoms and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond [35] that require quantum systems and a laser for control. Topological technologies can also form the basis of qubits [36], though their experimental realization is much harder. These technologies all share the same basic principle of operating as a quantum two level system.
In this work we explore a quantum processing unit based on a four-level system. While there have been some earlier works on such systems, including multilevel superconducting circuits as single qud its and two-qubit gates [37, 38], here we consider a special four-level system with -rotation invariance as discussed below to address one of the biggest challenges in quantum information processing.
Indeed, one of the biggest hurdles for a competitive quantum computation is to keep the error rate low for each quantum operation [39]. These errors can stem from the precision of the quantum manipulation, like the sweeping of a gate voltage in solid state qubits or the duration of a laser pulse in optical schemes [40]. In addition, there are errors due to decoherence [41]. These are often considered more fundamental in the sense that they don't depend on the precision of the instrumentation but are intrinsic to the quantum system considered. They are a reflection of the coupling to the outside environment. Sources of decoherence can be leads, nuclear spins, optical absorption, phonons, and non-linearities. Most of these environments fall into the category of fermionic or bosonic baths [42, 43].
In our basic quantum information unit, based on a four-level system, we will consider the effect of external leads as the main source of decoherence. Indeed, in solidstate-based qubits electric leads are often the main source of decoherence, particularly in superconducting qubits and semiconductor quantum dots [44]. While our model is not limited to a particular implementation, we will use the coupled quantum dot geometry as an illustration of our quantum processor unit.

II. PRELIMINARIES

Let us consider first a physical system formed by a core of four coupled quantum dots with on-site energies i. Each quantum dot interacts with all the other dots via complex couplings (we will discuss in section III F how it is possible to realize complex couplings physically). The corresponding isolated Hamiltonian is

FIG. 1: Depiction of the model, consisting of a 4-site core system (disks and dark arrows) tunnel-coupled to four identical semi-infinite leads (rectangular boxes). The core system is -rotation-invariant (see Section III) for any 4 = 1. The tunable parameters are ,   R and   C. The hopping parameters linking the sites are generally complex. The coupling constants between the core's sites and the leads are equal to tc. All hopping amplitudes along the leads are set to unity.

Each dot is now made to interact with a semi-infinite chain consisting of a semi-infinite hopping Hamiltonian with hopping parameter set to unity (thus setting the scale for all energies). The leads have scattering eigenstates with energies -2 < E < 2. Tunnel couplings between dot and chain are initially all identical and are chosen real, positive and small (0 < tc 1). As in the case of double- and triple-dots, the Feshbach projector method shows that the effect of each lead is to modify the self-energies of the dots. In this work, we will study a similar core system formed by 4 sites (though not necessarily quantum dots) tunnel-coupled to semi-infinite leads, but with a crucial additional core symmetry.
Specifically, we will consider the single-particle sector of a class of tunable systems possessing a simple geometric symmetry, dubbed -rotation invariance, to be defined in the next section. A diagram of the model used throughout the paper is displayed in Fig. 1. It consists of a completely connected 4-site core system tunnel-coupled to four identical semi-infinite leads (a simple physical example being four quantum dots tunnel-coupled to semiinfinite leads). The Hamiltonian is

restricted to the single-particle sector of Hilbert space.

The core couplings hij are chosen to satisfy relationships ensuring -rotation invariance (see Section III). The coupling between site i and lead i is tc, which can be taken real and positive without loss of generality. The Hamiltonian has been normalized such that the hopping parameter within the semi-infinite chains is unity. The operators

ai and bi,j are annihilation operators, acting respectively on site i of the core system, and on site j of the i-th lead.
Since we work in the single-particle sector, these opera-

tors could be fermionic or bosonic. (An example of each would be a single electron and a Cooper pair, respectively. Cold atoms can realize either choice.) Our choice of a 4-level core is motivated by our desire to describe two coupled qubits. The four semi-infinite leads simulate individual contact with the environment and enable us to reveal selective protection from decoherence. Most of our results can be generalized to an arbitrary number of sites in the core system with corresponding identical leads. The required modifications will be discussed briefly in the Discussion and in the Appendices.
A. Outline of the paper
In Section III we focus on the core system. We define -rotation invariance as an obvious generalization of discrete rotation invariance, and show that the tunable parameters of an -rotation-invariant system give full control over its eigenenergies while the energy eigenstates remain fixed. Independent control over the energy levels will be used frequently and is the main motivation for enacting -rotation invariance. Systems with this symmetry could be realized by applying the technique of synthetic gauge fields on a tight-binding Hamiltonian [45]. Selecting a representative from two gauge-inequivalent classes and following the scheme of Deutsch et al. [9], we show that our 4-level core system is strictly universal for quantum computation. We then consider one possible two-qubit logical basis and discuss single-pulse logical gates as well as qubit initialization and measurement.
In Section IV we consider the effect of the four identical leads on the core. The effective Hamiltonian of the core will in general be non-Hermitian but will remain -rotation-invariant, and as a consequence will still allow independent energy tuning. Our ability to fully control the (potentially complex) eigenenergies will result in the possibility of transmitting an eigenstate through the leads or else of protecting it from decoherence, independently of the other eigenstates. In that sense, the 4-level core may be used as a two-qubit quantum memory unit.
Finally, in Section V we propose a scalable scheme for universal quantum computation based on 4-level cores as the elementary computational units. The number of cores required scales linearly in the number of qubits. Because cores play a role similar to that of transistors in classical computation, we propose to call them quantumcomputational transistors, or more succinctly quansistors.
Rotation-invariant (circulant) 4 × 4 Hamiltonians have recently been advocated [46] as a way to implement the adiabatic Fourier transform on two qubits, with gate and entanglement benefitting from a symmetry that protects against decoherence. The proposal includes a possible physical implementation of circulant symmetry by tuning spin-spin interactions in ion traps. Although our work also utilizes (generalized) circulant symmetry for protection against decoherence, the aim and scope of

4

the present article are somewhat different. We put forward a blueprint for scalable universal quantum computation based on symmetry-protected qubit clusters, with -rotation invariance standing out as the prototype of a symmetry which is provably universal, and realistically implementable physically on a variety of platforms.

III. CORE SYSTEM

For a 4 × 4 matrix, we make a slight generalization of the notion of discrete rotational invariance (which can also be viewed as cyclic permutation of the sites) to rotation invariance: M is -rotation-invariant if

J M J = M , 4 = 1,

Rotational invariance obviously corresponds to  = 1. The matrices J1 and Jei/2 , and their higher dimensional versions, have been discussed in discrete quantum mechanics under the name of Weyl's X and Y matrices, and in quantum information under the name of generalized Pauli X and Y matrices (see Appendix A). In the 4 × 4 case we have

(Note that the matrix X is sometimes called X in the literature.) Just as rotation-invariant matrices are precisely circulant matrices, -rotation-invariant matrices correspond to -circulant matrices:

3

Circ(z0, . . . , z3) = zsJs ,

(6)

s=0

with zs  C. The terms `-rotation-invariant' and `circulant' will be used interchangeably. For Hermitian
-circulant 4×4 matrices the number of independent real
parameters is reduced to four. Such matrices constitute
what we propose to call a flat class : mutually commuting matrices {H(g) | g  R4} with common eigenbasis
independent of g, and real eigenvalues 1(g), . . . , 4(g) in one-to-one correspondence with the values of the parameters g  R4. Each fourth root of unity  corresponds
to a flat class. (See Appendix A for details.)
We consider 4-level cores with the ability to take a non-
symmetric form (the off mode), and a symmetric form

(the computational mode). In the off mode, the Hamiltonian is almost diagonal in the single-particle position eigenbasis:

Hoff = - Kij ai aj +

iai ai,

(7)

where large energy offsets | i - j|

Kij > 0 ef-

fectively suppress spontaneous transitions. The logical

states {|00 , |01 , |10 , |11 } are naturally chosen to co-

incide with the position basis eigenstates {|m }m=1,...,4.

We will come back to this mode later.

In the computational mode, the core system is -

rotation-invariant in the position basis for all values of

its parameters. The matrix of core couplings {hij} in (2) will thus form a class of Hermitian -circulant Hamilto-

nian matrices

Hpos(g, ) = zs(g)Js ,

(8)

s=0

with zs  C, g  R4, and 4 = 1. (Recall that the complex coefficients zs are constrained by Hermiticity Hpos = (Hpos), leaving only four real independent parameters g.) For each q = 0, . . . , 3 the class  = eiq/2
is flat and diagonalized by a modified quantum Fourier transform FDq, where F is the regular quantum Fourier
transform

trix corresponds to a dual vector component, whereas

the second index corresponds to a vector component :

m|qk = (F Dq)m,k, qk|m = (F Dq)k,m. (12)
For the purpose of universal quantum computation, two classes of -circulant Hamiltonians are necessary and sufficient : the class X of circulant Hamiltonians ( = 1), and the class Y of i-circulant Hamiltonians ( = ei/2). In Section III C we will build a universal set comprising only one Hamiltonian from each class. We will now consider each of these classes in turn.

Any path in energy space (1, 2, 3, 4) corresponds to a unique path in parameter space ( , , , ), giving full

(23)

Again, any path in energy space (1, 2, 3, 4) corresponds to a unique path in parameter space ( , , , ), giving full control over the energy levels of the class.
Independent control over the energy levels will be used later and is a prime motivation for using -rotation invariance, but we stress that this choice of symmetry is not unique. (See Section A for details.) We can now distinguish four `natural' bases for the system, namely the position basis {|m }, the energy bases {|k } and {|k }, and the logical basis {|00 , |01 , |10 , |11 }, defined by identification with the positions eigenstates |m :

4
| = 1m, |m ,
m=1

(24)

where the index of the identity matrix 1 runs over the ordered set (00, 01, 10, 11). Our choice is motivated by simplicity, and by the proposal for quansistor interaction, to be discussed later. The universality result discussed in the next section is independent of this choice. Moreover, the Solovay-Kitaev theorem teaches us that simulating one universal set with another can be done in a fault-tolerant manner with polylogarithmic overhead, usually a quite acceptable cost. The four working bases {|m }, {|k }, {|k }, {| }, and their relationships (15),(21),(24) are summarized in the commutative diagram of Fig. 2.

C. Strict universality on two qubits

The system Hpos(g, ) of (8), with  equal to either 1 or ei/2, generates a strictly universal set of 2-qubit gates. In fact we prove the stronger result that the finite set {V, W}  U(4) is strictly universal, where the unitaries V and W, defined below, belong to classes X and Y , respectively. We use the scheme of Ref. [9] to prove our claim. We construct sixteen Hermitian 4×4 matrices H1, . . . , H16 whose evolution unitaries are all within our repertoire, meaning that those unitaries can be approximated with arbitrary accuracy by repeatedly applying the gates V and W. The set {H1, . . . , H16} is linearly independent over R so it spans the 16-dimensional R-space of Hermitian 4 × 4 matrices, which are evolved to generate all 4 × 4 unitaries. Our repertoire therefore coincides with U(4), or in other words, is strictly universal on two qubits.
We first define

H1

(25)

+i 2 -i 1

and the unitary V = e-iH1 , both of class X. We also define

H~

=

1 2

1

+

(1

+

i 4

)Y

+ h.c.

(26)

and the unitary W = e-iH~ /2, both of class Y . All unitaries of the form Vs = e-isH1 for s  [0, 2) are in our

repertoire, because integers mod 2 can be found arbitrarily close to s. The repertoire also comprises WVW, and more generally WVsW for s  [0, 2), which are

generated by the Hamiltonian

H2 = WH1W.

(27)

(Note that whether or not H2 can be obtained from the system's Hamiltonian is irrelevant. It is sufficient that the unitary WVsW be in the repertoire for any s.) We
finally define

Hj = i[H1, Hj-1] , j = 3, . . . , 14

H15 = i[H2, H3]

(28)

H16 = i[H2, H5].

Any unitary generated by Hj, for j  {1, . . . , 16}, is in the repertoire because of the identity

e[P,Q] = lim









e-iP/ neiQ/ neiP/ ne-iQ/ n

n
,

(29)

n

which ultimately boils down to a sequence of V's and W's. Unitaries generated by real linear combinations of the Hj's are in the repertoire as well because of the identity

ei(xP +yQ) = lim

eixP /n eiyQ/n

n
.

n

(30)

To show that {H1, . . . , H16} is linearly independent over R we consider the 4×4 matrices Hj as 16-component vectors (obtained by stacking the columns of the matrix one

on top of the next from left to right), and compute the

determinant of the 16 × 16 matrix [H1| · · · |H16] whose columns are made of these 16-component vectors. We

find det[H1| · · · |H16] = P (), where P is a polynomial of high order with nontranscendental coefficients (specifically, coefficients in Q[ 2, i]). Since  is transcendental

we conclude that P () = 0 -- actually |P ()|  1073 --

so {H1, . . . , H16} spans the space of 4 × 4 Hermitian matrices, as required. We have thus proved that the reper-

toire of {V, W} is all of U(4).

We conclude with a word about the Hamiltonians H1, H~ chosen to generate the gates V, W in the above construction. Firstly, these Hamiltonians were chosen

to produce a sequence of matrices H1, . . . , H16 with coefficients in Q[ 2, , i], a property used in the proof of

linear independence of the Hj's. This condition is by no means necessary for linear independence, and many

sets of gates other than {V, W} would qualify as univer-

sal. Secondly, the Hamiltonians H1, H~ were also chosen

to be nondegenerate, with spectra {3 ± 2, -3, 1} and

{1 ±

5 22

,

1±

3 22

},

respectively,

a

property

also

shared

with the off mode, Eq. (7). Nondegeneracy plays no role

in the above argument, but is desirable in any physical

implementation in order to avoid spurious transitions due

to coupling with external degrees of freedom.

D. Symmetry protection against unbiased parameter noise

When a quansistor is in its symmetric form, performing a logical operation in either -class, its eigenstates are independent of the (real) parameters g = ( , , , ) in the Hamiltonian. As a consequence, when these parameters evolve,

( , , , )  ( (t), (t), (t), (t)), t  [0, T ], (31)

the corresponding logical gate unitary U (T ) is a function of the parameters' time averages only

U (T ) = U ( ,  ,  ,  ),

(32)

with

·

=

1 T

T 0

dt(·).

This

is

easily

seen

by

recognizing

that H( , , , ) is diagonalized by a common unitary V

for all values of the parameters:

V H(g)V = diag(1(g), . . . , 4(g)).

(33)

Thus

U (T ) = V exp -i dt V H(g)V V  (34)
= V diag e-iT 1 , . . . , e-iT 4 V .

From (17) and (22) we get immediately that U (T ) = U ( ,  ,  ,  ). One advantage resulting from this

7

fact is that any parameter noise h(t) without bias, h = 0, will leave the unitary evolution operator U (t) unaffected:
U (g(t) + h(t)) = U ( g + h ) = U ( g ). (35)
If the quansistor interacts with the environment in such a way that the dominant effect of the latter on the quansistor is unbiased noise in the parameters, then logical operations internal to the quansistor are protected from those influences by symmetry. And if the bias has a nonzero but known value, it is easily compensated for. The argument is valid for any flat class (see Appendix A), i.e., generalizing from four states to N , any class of Hamiltonians of the form V diag(1(g), . . . , N (g))V  for some unitary V , and functions r(g) = s gssr with det[sr] = 0. Of course, the symmetry itself, being the key ingredient here, must be enforced.

E. Gauge potentials for -classes

We now provide a "lattice gauge field" description of -

rotation invariance. In Fig. 3 the core is displayed so that

it can be visualized as either planar (as shown) or tetra-

hedral (by raising the central point |4 ). The complex

hopping parameters linking the sites (the link variables)

have the form hjk = |hjk|eijk . In the lattice picture, vertices |j stand for the matter field, and the phases on

the links |j -jk |k correspond to a U(1) gauge poten-

As a consequence, only three plaquette fluxes are linearly independent, and the planar and tetrahedral models are completely equivalent. (The 4-level quansistor is essentially 2-dimensional. This is in contrast to higher-level quansistors, which are intrinsically higher-dimensional, as explained in the Discussion.) Of the six gauge phases jk, j < k, three are independent and generate a manifold of Hamiltonians for each given flux structure. It is convenient to distinguish -circulant Hamiltonians by their flux structure or "magnetic" field, whether fundamental or synthetic. Hamiltonians with different flux structures belong to gauge-inequivalent classes, and are measurably different. Fig. 3 displays (a) transition amplitudes, and (b) gauge phases.

Similarly, the topological flux structure observed in Fig. 5

cannot be realized by Hamiltonians of class X, hence

span(X, X2, X3) span(Y 2). On the other hand, by

combining the diagrams of Figs. 4 and 5 we see that span(X, X2, X3) = span(Y, Y 2, Y 3). Indeed, a matrix of class X with X1 coefficient  = | |ei is gauge-equivalent

to a matrix of class Y with Y 1 coefficient  = | |ei if

and only if    -/4 mod 2. In particular, the Hamil-

tonians H1 and H~ from the universality proof, Eqs. 25 and 26, belong to inequivalent flux structures.

F. Physical implementation
In the previous section, we have argued that Hamiltonians from different -classes may have different flux structures, with three linearly independent plaquette fluxes. They could therefore be realized by applying magnetic fields onto 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional charged systems with initial Hamiltonians in the form of the off mode Hamiltonian, Eq. (7). The topological (rightmost) flux structure from Fig. 4, for instance, could be produced from a very long and thin solenoid penetrating a tetrahedron through one face, and isotropically releasing a flux of 2 at the center of the tetrahedron. This flux structure properly belongs to class Y , and cannot be realized in class X.
In this section we sketch how the classes X and Y could be implemented in a wide range of physical systems, comprised of either charged or neutral levels, using the techniques of synthetic gauge fields. The appearance of gauge structures in systems with parameter-dependent Hamiltonians [47, 48] or time-periodic Hamiltonians [49] is well known. In the former case, and when the adiabatic approximation holds, the dynamics of an adiabatically evolving particle can be projected onto the subspace spanned by the mth eigenstate m(R(t)). The resulting effective Schr¨odinger equation for m(R(t)) involves a Berry connection A(R) playing the role of a gauge potential, through the substitution p  p - A in the effective Hamiltonian, or equivalently, as a geometric phase exp i dR · A acquired by m(R(t)) over the displacement. This has been shown to occur in mechanical systems [50], molecular systems [51], and condensed matter systems [52]. Similarly, for systems driven by fast time-periodic modulations (Floquet engineering), one may consider the evolution at stroboscopic times tN = N T , where T is the driving period [45, 53]. Here again, the resulting effective dynamics has been shown to yield non-trivial gauge structures in different platforms such as condensed matter systems [54, 55], photonics [56, 57], ultracold atoms in optical lattices [58­63], and ions in micro-fabricated traps [64, 65]. In a lattice with coordination number d, nearest-neighbor hopping

terms Km,m+u|m + u m| act on wavefunctions as
(m)  Km,m+u(m + u) = Km,m+ue-iu·p(m), (38)
where naturally p is the momentum operator and u is a vector of unit norm in Zd. In the presence of an effective gauge potential A(m), the Peierls substitution p  p - A(m) amounts to the complexification of real hopping parameters
Km,m+u  Km,m+ueiu·A(m) = Km,m+ueim,m+u . (39)
The Peierls phases m,m+u may also depend on internal degrees of freedom (pseudospin) and can then be thought of as resulting from an artificial or synthetic non-abelian gauge field [45]. For the implementation of the classes X and Y , we need to realize the gauge-invariant flux structures described in Section III E, whether fundamental or artificial. One possibility is to Floquet engineer Peierls phases as in the Hamiltonians (14) and (20). In the former, we have Peierls phases j,j+1  , and all others zero. In the latter, we have instead j,j+1 =  + (/2)j-1 and 13 = , and all others zero.
In [60], for instance, lattice shaking is used to prompt a fast periodic modulation of the on-site energies of a tightbinding Hamiltonian analogous to our off-mode Hamiltonian, Eq. (7) :

H(t) = - Kij ai aj + ( i + vi(t))ai ai

ij

i

(40)

where Kij > 0, vi(t) = vi(t + T ), and vi T =

1 T

Using Floquet analysis, the result-

ing effective time-independent Hamiltonian proves to be

with complex tunneling amplitudes

As long

as the driving functions break certain symmetries, the

Peierls phases can be varied smoothly to any value be-

tween 0 and 2. Producing non-trivial Peierls phases

that cannot be gauged away may require additional static

structure, like large energy offsets | j - i| Kij [60]. In

our setup, these large energy offsets are already present in

the off-mode Hamiltonian to effectively suppress sponta-

neous transitions between logical states (position eigen-

states).

IV. COUPLING TO LEADS
We now consider the effect of the semi-infinite leads on the core system. As indicated in the Hamiltonian (2)

9

and in Fig. 1, each site (for example, a quantum dot) is tunnel-coupled to its own lead (which could be, for example, a semi-infinite spin chain) but the parameters and coupling constants of the four leads are chosen to be identical. The transition amplitudes in the leads are set to unity, and the lead-to-site coupling tc can be chosen real and positive with no loss of generality. Coupling the core to the leads may serve to model the core's immersion in its immediate environment, and that is the point of view adopted in Section IV A. Alternatively, the leads may represent designed transmission wires between the core and distant devices. This perspective is explored in Section IV B.
It is shown in Appendix B that the effect of the leads on the core Hamiltonian (8) can be summarized in an effective, energy-dependent diagonal offset:

H(E) = Hpos(g, ) + t2c(E)1,

(43)

where (E) is the surface Green's function of a semiinfinite lead:

(E)

=

(44)

It follows that -circulation is preserved. For instance, when  = 1 (class X) we have the circulant effective Hamiltonian

with effective self-energies

(E) = + t2c(E)

E 2-

(E + i0+)2 - 4 2

.

(46)

Because -rotation invariance is preserved, the eigenstates are energy-independent, and still given by (15). The corresponding effective eigenvalues are obtained from the isolated levels k, (16), by the replacement
 (E):

k,(E) =

cos(

)

(-1)k 

= t2c(E) + k

(47)

for k = 1, . . . , 4. But these are not effective eigenenergies as can be seen from the Green's function:

Gcore(E) = (E - H(E))-1 =

k

E

|k k| - k,(E)

,

(48)

the effective energy levels of the core-with-leads are fixed points Ek = k,(Ek). (From now on the symbol " " will always indicate an effective energy due to the presence of the leads.) From (46), and the convention used

for the definition of the complex square root,

(49) .

Since each k-mode is decoupled from the others, we have chosen k  0 with no loss of generality. Eq. (49) and the corresponding expression for negative k is obtained in Appendix C by analytically solving the core-with-leads Schr¨odinger equation. Because the effective eigenstates do not depend on the scattering energy, it is easy to define a first-order effective core Hamiltonian which is energyindependent

Gcore(E)  (E - Heff)-1 =

k

|k E-

k | Ek

.

(50)

In the ordered eigenbasis {|1 , |2 , |3 , |4 } we have j|Heff|k = Ej jk. All the results from Section III can now be modified by the replacement k  Ek. Note that Ek is real if and only if |k|  2 1 - t2c + O(t4c). (More precisely, |k|  2 - t2c, as shown in the Appendix. See (C22),(C23).) Since any path in (1, 2, 3, 4)space corresponds to a unique path in parameter space
( , , , ), each Ek can be made real or complex independently of the other three. Thus, each eigenstate can
be made to evolve unitarily or not by adjusting the inter-
nal parameters of the core, permitting exquisite control
over (partial) decoherence [66]. For class Y (i.e.  = ei/2), expressions identical
to (49),(50) hold with the replacements k  k (21) and k  k (22). Again, full control over the core energies allows to make each Ek real or complex independently of the other three.
The same is true, with a caveat, when the core is in
the nonsymmetric off mode,

Hoff = - Kij ai aj +

iai ai,

ij

(51)

where large energy offsets | i - j| Kij > 0 effec-

tively suppress spontaneous transitions, so that posi-

tion i is almost a good quantum number. Then again

This time

care

must be taken to maintain the large-offset condition when

lowering the m's below the escape threshold, in order to

prevent spurious logical transitions.

A. Symmetry-protected logical gates
In this section we show that, even in the presence of leads, all logical gates can be realized without leakage, and are still symmetry-protected from unbiased parameter noise. It is sufficient to consider single-pulse,

10

-circulant gates, since they are universal for quantum

computation. We could use only the gates {V, W} from

Section III C, for instance. Let a single pulse producing

the gate U be given in the time interval t  [0, T ] by the

path (1(t), . . . , 4(t)) in the energy space of the bare core. With a lead coupled to each site, eigenenergies k are modified to possibly complex effective eigenenergies

Ek. We must make sure that |k|  2 - t2c at all times to keep Ek real and prevent escape through the leads. If not, rescaling the energies by n and the time by 1/n leaves

unchanged the unitary U

=

exp

-i

T 0

dt

Hcore(t)

.

Avoiding the energy band of the leads is therefore not

an issue. Moreover, for these values of k, the function

Ek(k) increases monotonically, and hence is one-to-one. As an immediate consequence, there is a (unique) path

(1(t), . . . , 4(t)) lying entirely outside the band of the leads such that

Ek(k(t)) = k(t) We thus obtain

k  {1, . . . , 4}, t  [0, T ]. (52)

T

Ueff = exp -i dt Heff(t) = U.

(53)

0

Having reproduced the ideal gate U in the presence of the leads, and recalling that identical leads preserve rotation invariance, we conclude that the effective gate Ueff is symmetry-protected from unbiased noise in the effective parameters Ek. And since the functions Ek(k) are very nearly linear outside the band, unbiased noise in Ek is equivalent to unbiased noise in the bare parameters. This completes our claim that, even in the presence of leads, logical gates can be realized without leakage and are still protected against unbiased noise in the parameters (whether bare or effective).

B. Core as quantum memory

Within each -class the effective eigenenergies can be chosen real or complex independently of one another, and as a consequence each energy eigenstate can independently be made to dissipate in the leads or remain stationary. (The off mode offers comparatively less flexibility because of the condition | i - j| Kij > 0, although crossing levels is ill-advised in any mode.) The dissipation of the k-th eigenstate is characterized by the tunable dynamical rate

 -1(k) = |Im(Ek)|,

(54)

which is found from (49) to be a continuous function of the (fully controllable) energy k, with values in the interval [0, 2/3 3]  [0, 0.385]. The ability to prevent the eigenstates from escaping to the leads allows us to consider the core as a versatile quantum memory unit that can protect a state k ak|k for a long time, and then

release it entirely or partially at a later time. (In what follows |k will stand for an eigenstate of either class X or Y , unless specified otherwise.) This is the perspective that we adopt in this section, and to do so it is convenient to go beyond the first-order Green's function analysis that we have employed so far, which loses track of effective core eigenstates as they escape, with no possibility of ever coming back. We emphasize that our proposal assumes nothing other than the existence of a flat symmetry class in the physical support of information, an aspect which to the best of our knowledge has not been exploited in quantum memory technologies [67­71].
We consider the following finite system: it consists of two -circulant 4-level cores standing face to face, and connected by four identical leads, each comprised of L sites. One may think of it as a square prism of height L, with the cores as top and bottom faces. The cores act as memory storage units. We will identify when and why a state localized on one core will scatter within characteristic time s, eventually reaching the other core. Alternatively, we discuss how the localized state can be protected from scattering over a timescale b s. The index b stands for bound states, whose presence or absence determines the dissipation regime.
In Appendix C we show that the -circulant system decouples into four identical modes, each in the form of two sites of self-energies , µ connected by a finite lead of L sites. The single-particle Hamiltonian of one mode is

(The argument generalizes in a straightforward manner if the 4-level cores are replaced by N -level cores.) The corresponding Schr¨odinger equation is easily solved, yielding eigenenergies E in implicit form

and Un(x) is a Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind. The L + 2 solutions of (56) are the system's eigenenergies. Unsurprisingly, this equation cannot be solved analytically; a graphical solution is displayed in Fig. 6. Note that the RHS (blue curves) is independent of the couplings to the cores and pertains to the spectrum of the leads whereas the LHS (yellow curves) is independent of the lead parameters and pertains to the coupling. L solutions always belong to the energy band [-2, 2], and form

11

the (perturbed) continuous spectrum of the leads. The two remaining solutions may lie outside the band (bound states) or within the band (hybridized scattering states). We now discuss these cases in turn.
Let us write single-particle states as

for 0  j  L + 1. Here ± = sgn(E),  = cosh-1(|E|/2) and N is a normalization factor. These states are localized around both endpoints, decaying exponentially over the characteristic length scale -1 from the endpoints.
Throughout this section, all calculations will be done using L = 10 and tc,1 = tc,2  tc = 0.1. The bound states for  = µ = 2.5 are displayed in Fig. 7 a,b. We see that there is a symmetric state |bS and an antisymmetric state |bA , a consequence of the Schr¨odinger equation symmetry j  L + 1 - j resulting from  = ~ (see Appendix C). When L  , the limiting expression for j describes a bound state localized at the left endpoint and decaying exponentially with distance. Similarly, the limiting expression for L+1-j describes a state localized at the right endpoint. In that limit, the eigenvalue equation (56) is equivalent to the fixed-point relations E =  ± |tc,1|2(E) and E = µ ± |tc,2|2(E) for the states localized on the left and right, respectively. In the Green's function treatment of the core with semi-infinite leads (see Appendix B), the same fixed-point relation appears as the effective self-energy of the core once the leads are traced out. In the finite-L case, states localized around a single end of the lead will only be approximately stationary. If the system evolves for a long time, the state localized on one end will eventually tunnel through the lead.
All other single-particle solutions, Eq. (58), fall within the band of the leads, E  [-2, 2], with coefficients given by

where  = cos-1(E/2). For any finite L, there are L scattering states from the (perturbed) continuous spectrum of the leads. A generic feature of these L states is their small amplitude at the endpoints. Two continuum states for  = µ = 2.5 are displayed in Fig. 7 c,d.
When bound states are not present, in addition to the continuum states there will be two hybridized scattering states: one symmetric |hS and one antisymmetric |hA . A generic feature of these states is their relatively large amplitude at the endpoints. Such states are displayed in

Fig. 8 a,b for  = µ = 1.4; for this same case example
scattering states with E  [-2, 2] are displayed in Fig. 8
c,d.
Decay rates in the presence of bound states |bS and |bA are compared with decay rates in the presence of hybridized states |hS and |hA . Let the state be

L

| = an|n + cS|S + cA|A ,

(61)

where |n is a state from the continuous spectrum, and |S,A is bound or hybridized. Then

where f~ is the inverse Fourier transform of f , and

If f (E) has support of width E (in [-2, 2]), its inverse Fourier transform f~(t) will decay within time t 
O(1/E). A small decay rate implies that | has over-
lap almost zero with most states of the continuous spec-
trum. This is possible for a localized | only if bound
states |bS and |bA are available, e.g., if  = µ / [-2, 2]. An example is | = (|bS + |bA )/ 2, which is well localized around the left-hand dot. Then

(65)

With the canonical parameter values (L, tc) = (10, 0.1), this goes slowly to zero with rate b-1 = ESb - EAb  10-5 (and oscillates back and forth unless L is infinite).
If bound states are not available (e.g., if  = µ  [-2, 2]), then a localized state necessarily has an f (E) with large support E, and | |e-itH | |2 will decay within time t  O(1/E) to the oscillating steadystate

| |e-itH | |2  |cS|4 +|cA|4 +2|cS|2|cA|2 cos(ESh -EAh )t. (66)
With the same canonical parameter values, this oscillates with rate s-1 = ESh - EAh  10-2. With these values, the characteristic escape time of localized states is reduced by a factor of 103 when effective eigenenergies become
complex and bound states are no longer available. The overall rate of decay, max(E, ESh - EAh )  4, can be as large as O(1). The above analysis shows that the core in
either -class has the ability to receive and release states

Initializations and measurements are naturally performed through position measurements or energy measurements of either -class. Position eigenstates corre-

Define, for instance, the POVM {E0, E1} with elements the joint-position projectors

E0 = |1 1| + |2 2|

(69)

E1 = |3 3| + |4 4|.

13

These operators correspond to the measurement/initialization of the first qubit only:

E0 = |00 00| + |01 01| = |0 0|  1

(70)

E1 = |10 10| + |11 11| = |1 1|  1.

Similarly, the POVM {E0, E1} with elements

E0 = |1 1| + |3 3|

E1 = |2 2| + |4 4|

(71)

corresponds to the measurement/initialization of the second qubit:

E0 = |00 00| + |10 10| = 1  |0 0|

E1 = |01 01| + |11 11| = 1  |1 1|.

V. SCALABILITY

We now propose a scalable technology for universal quantum computation. The idea is strongly reminiscent of classical computer architecture, in which operations are decomposed into elementary two-bit steps to be performed on large arrays of transistors. Here we use the fact that any unitary U on d qubits can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy by finite products of elementary two-qubit unitaries, i.e., operations of the form V (m, W ) = 1m  W  1d-m-2, where W is a 4 × 4 unitary [5]. For any > 0 there exists a finite sequence of such two-qubit unitaries V1, . . . , Vk achieving

max (Ud - V1V2 · · · Vk)| < ,

(73)

|

where | is any normalized d-qubit state. We thus consider the possibility of realizing quantum computation on scalable grids of 4-level cores. By analogy with the role played by transistors in classical computation, we may consider the cores to be quantum-computational transistors, or more succinctly, quansistors.

A. Quansistors
The core, or quansistor, is a four-level tight-binding system with the ability to become -rotation-invariant for  = 1, ei/2 (classes X, Y ). Until now we have mostly considered the quansistor in its symmetric form, performing computation on its double qubit. From the universality proof of Section III C, we know that the set of gates {V, W}, constructed from the Hamiltonians (25),(26), is universal on two qubits. This set contains one representative from each class, X and Y , and these representatives realize inequivalent flux structures. The next step is to allow interactions between quansistors. We choose the most basic two-quansistor interaction, involving one qubit from each quansistor. To that end, we need to

materialize the tensor product structure inherent to the quansistor logical basis {|00 , |01 , |10 , |11 }. Thus far, these qubit states merely label the states of the quansistor, and need to be factored into pairs of spatially separable qubits before they can be shared with distinct target quansistors. Let us devote some attention to the nonsymmetric form of the quansistor, which is also the off mode for computation. Note that the off-mode Hamiltonian cannot be the -circulant matrix 1, because the degenerate eigenstates of the latter are unstable to perturbations.
In the off mode, the Hamiltonian is simply

Hoff = - Kij ai aj +

i ai ai,

ij

i

(74)

where Kij > 0, and large energy offsets | i - j | Kij effectively suppress spontaneous transitions, so that position i is almost a good quantum number in the off mode. (As before, the symbol " " indicates an effective energy due to the presence of the leads.) Logical states {|00 , |01 , |10 , |11 } coincide with position eigenstates {|1 , |2 , |3 , |4 }, respectively. Section III F illustrates how the system can be switched from (74) to circulant Hamiltonians of class X or Y and back using electrically charged levels and magnetic fields on the one hand, and neutral levels and synthetic gauge fields on the other. Notice that
span{|1 , |2 } = {|0 | |  any 2nd qubit state } span{|3 , |4 } = {|1 | |  any 2nd qubit state }. (75)

Similarly,

span{|1 , |3 } = {| |0 |  any 1st qubit state } span{|2 , |4 } = {| |1 |  any 1st qubit state }. (76)

We now demand that the off-mode on-site energies satisfy

3 - 1 = 1 = 4 - 2,

(77)

2 - 1 = 2 = 4 - 3

(78)

(see Figs. 9, 10). Eqs. (75) and (77) imply that setting
the quansistor into resonance at frequency 1 prompts the onset of 1st-qubit oscillations |0 |  |1 | with
frequency 1. By the same token, Eqs. (76) and (78) imply that quansistor resonance at frequency 2 corresponds to 2nd-qubit oscillations | |0  | |1 at fre-
quency 2. For this reason, the frequencies 1 and 2 may be called qubit splitting, and will be used to exchange
single qubits between distant quansistors. When coupled
to a single-mode resonator, the quansistor resonating at
one of these frequencies q will effectively look like a single qubit coupled to the oscillator as described by the
Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian

where z = |1 1| - |0 0|. The frequencies 1 ± 2, on the other hand, are not qubit splitting, and correspond to
the oscillations |00  |11 and |01  |10 , respectively.

B. Scalable architecture
Interactions between quansistors are to be performed by coupling their qubit-splitting frequencies. It seems desirable to mediate the coupling with single-mode resonators, allowing distributed circuit elements, and to work in the dispersive regime where two quansistors A, B are mutually resonant, but far-detuned from the resonator:

A = B = r.

(80)

The interaction then proceeds through virtual photon exchange, as opposed to real photons in the resonant regime, alleviating the major drawback of the latter, namely the resonator-induced decay due to energy exchange with the resonator (Purcell effect) [72]. In the rotating wave approximation, the Hamiltonian in the ab-

(82)

where K = 2 gAgB/. The qubit-cavity interaction terms cancel out exactly, leaving only an effective qubit-qubit interaction with coupling K. This term, when evolved for a time /4K, generates the iSWAP gate, which is entangling and equivalent to the CNOT gate [27, 72], up to single-qubit operations already available within the quansistors. The dispersive regime thus allows for the possibility of long-distance entangling interactions between quansistors.
One possible architecture for universal computation on 2d qubits consists in a closed linear array of d quansistors coupled through resonators. Each quansistor represents a pair of qubits, and every qubit is represented exactly once (see Fig. 11). Additional qubit-splitting frequencies may be added to prevent untimely higher-order, mth-nearestneighbor couplings. To cut down space and running time costs, a physical implementation of the array would likely be folded, and a resonator would couple every adjacent pair of quansistors, thus reducing considerably the need for qubit-shuffling operations. Fig. 12 schematically depicts a planar-grid computer. Each quansistor would be coupled to four identical leads (not shown in the figure) for initialization and readout.

FIG. 11: A d-quansistor linear array for universal computation on 2d qubits. The numbers schematically represent the qubits. Quansistors (larger, blue) perform two-qubit universal operations on qubit pairs (2j, 2j +1), j = 0, . . ., d-1 (mod d). Couplers (smaller, green) perform entangling iSWAP gates on qubit pairs (2j - 1, 2j), j = 0, . . . , d - 1 (mod d). Leads are attached to the lower faces of the quansistors. With only three qubit-splitting frequencies in the system, 1, 2, 3, untimely second-nearest-quansistor interactions occur at higher orders. (For instance, pairs (2,3) and (6,7) both respond to 1.) More frequencies may be added to suppress these unwanted exchanges. The required physical resources scale linearly in the number of qubits.

FIG. 12: A 36-quansistor grid for universal computation on 72 qubits. Quansistors (large blue squares) perform universal two-qubit operations. Couplers (smaller green squares) perform entangling iSWAP between qubits of adjacent quansistors. Each quansistor is coupled to four identical leads (not shown) for initialization and readout. The required physical resources scale linearly in the number of qubits.
VI. DISCUSSION
Error-correcting codes are a promising avenue to make quantum computation fault-tolerant. In our technology, quansistors are the support of the physical qubits, whose states and interactions are symmetry-protected, to some extent, against external influences. Once we identify the dominant errors affecting them, we can find k-qubit states (typically k = 5, 7, 9) that are invariant under those errors. These are the encoded logical qubits. (In the standard Hamming notation, we get a code of type [kn, n] using kn physical qubits, and having 2n logical codewords [73].) Having physical universality at hand gives the freedom to encode qubits and operations yielding encoded universality. Because our technology is scalable (Q quansistors making 2Q qubits), the value of k is

15
not an issue: the encoding merely uses k identical `processors' instead of one. Crucially, we must determine whether the dominant errors are constrained by the symmetry of the quansistors. As source of decoherence we considered the coupling to semi-infinite leads, and have omitted other factors such as the effect of a heat bath on the system, the types of errors that it would produce, and the extent to which it would destroy symmetry.
Throughout, we have used -rotation invariance as the prototype of a symmetry of flat classes, universal for quantum computation, and realistically implementable physically. Other flat classes would perform equally well at protecting information and operations, as long as leads (or any other immediate environment of the clusters) do not break the corresponding symmetry. Universal sets of gates originating from nondegenerate Hamiltonians are symmetry-specific, but should not be too difficult to find given the relative scarcity of non-universal sets and the completeness of flat classes. The possibilities of physical implementation, on the other hand, will strongly depend on the chosen symmetry and would have to be found on a case-by-case basis.
There might be additional value to using larger qubit clusters, i.e. k-qubit quansistors realized as 2k sites with symmetries, for k = 3, 4, 5. All observations from the previous point regarding protection, universality, and implementation, apply here as well. Larger clusters and symmetry classes would offer protection to k-qubit operations. It could also allow the encoding of a logical qubit within a single k-qubit quansistor. Encodings with k = 3 (8 sites) can already correct some single-qubit errors, while some encodings with k = 5 (32 sites) can correct any single-qubit error [1].
There is provable surplus value to using higher alphabets (ququarts, specifically), instead of qubit pairs, in encrypted communications [74]. Since -circulant 4-level quansistors are universal in U(4), i.e. universal for singleququart operations, and have the ability to dynamically decouple from the leads, a quansistor-with-leads could be a versatile memory unit for ququarts, and become an essential component of quantum-secure communications. Generalizations to d-level quansistors (qudits), with d > 4, is also conceivable, as argued in the previous point. Error-correcting codes, notably, have been developed for qudits, that use d × d Weyl matrices (or equivalently the d × d version of our matrices X and Y ) [75, 76]. Note, however, that the diagram of transition amplitudes of the general qudit (Kd in graph theory terminology) is non-planar for d  5 [77], in contrast to the essentially planar diagram K4 of the 4-level system, Fig. 3. A gauge potential implementation of -rotation invariant qudits, in the spirit of Sections III E and III F, might then be essentially three-dimensional.
For the purpose of reconstructing the final state of an N -qubit system, a symmetry based on Pauli tensors of dimension d = 2N is better suited than -rotation invariance (based on Weyl matrices) as it allows for the maximal number (2N + 1) of mutually unbiased bases,

16

and complete state characterization via state tomography [78, 79]. By contrast, the 4-level quansistor (N = 2) based on -rotation invariance has only three unbiased bases : {|m }, {|k }, {|k }, the respective eigenbases of Z, X, Y . As for reconstructing the final state of an N qupit system (where p is an odd prime), the Weyl-based scheme of dimension d = pN allows for the maximal number (pN + 1) of mutually unbiased bases, and complete state characterization via quantum tomography [78, 80]. This could be of value for encrypted communication using a higher (prime) alphabet (see previous point), and could be based on p-site quansistors with -rotation invariance.
To perform inter-quansistor interactions, we have used the simplest possible scenario involving a single qubit from each quansistor. It would be worth investigating whether a combined use of resonators and symmetry could make possible the implementation of robust 3- and 4-qubit gates, or even interactions soliciting three quansistors or more. However, this is beyond the scope of this work.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this work, we have put forward a blueprint for scalable universal quantum computation based on 2-qubit clusters (quansistors) protected by symmetry (-rotation invariance). Embedding in the environment, initialization and readout are achieved by tunnel-coupling each quansistor to four identical semi-infinite leads. We show that quansistors can be dynamically decoupled from the leads by tuning their internal parameters, giving them the versatility required to act as controllable quantum memory units. With this dynamical decoupling, universal 2-qubit logical operations within quansistors are also symmetry-protected against unbiased noise in their parameters. Two-quansistor entangling operations are achieved by resonator-coupling theirqubit-splitting frequencies to effectively carry out the iSWAP gate, with one qubit coming from each quansistor. We have also identified platforms that could implement -rotation invariance.

IX. APPENDICES
Appendix A: Mathematical framework
This section describes some mathematical aspects of -rotation invariance. Although this paper has focused on a four-level system, many of the results are easily generalized. Here we consider the more general case of an N -level system. For multiple reasons it may be desirable to have full control over the N eigenenergies of the system. In what follows we consider what we propose to call flat classes of Hamiltonians : classes of Hermitian matrices {H(g) | g  RN } with a common eigenbasis, and real eigenenergies 1(g), . . . , N (g) in one-to-one linear correspondence with the values of the parameters, that is r(g) = s gssr with det[sr] = 0. (The term flat refers to vanishing Berry curvature in g-space.) A class of Hamiltonians is flat in this sense if and only if it can be represented as a sum of N × N Hermitian matrices,
N
H(g1, . . . , gN ) = gsHs , [Hs, Hr] = 0 (s, r)
s=1
(A1) and the N × N matrix [sr] of all eigenvalues of the Hs's is nonsingular, det[sr] = 0. (The key observation is the action of the diagonalizing unitary : U -1( s gsHs)U = s gsdiag(s1, . . . , sN ) = diag(1(g), . . . , N (g)).) Flat classes therefore coincide with N -dimensional commutative algebras of N ×N Hermitian matrices, the nonsingularity of [sr] being equivalent to the linear independence of the Hs's. Because each flat class is diagonalized by a common unitary U (unique up to permutations), flat classes corresponding to a given [sr] are in one-to-one correspondence with unitaries modulo permutations. (In this paper, we do not consider non-unitarily diagonalizable matrices, like non-Hermitian PT -symmetric Hamiltonians, for instance.) Flat classes are also closed under exponentiation. There seems to be an interesting connection between flat classes, on the one hand, and commuting bases of unitary matrices [78] and stabilizers of quantum error-correcting codes [75], on the other.
For the purpose of quantum computation a single flat class is clearly not enough because it is commutative. Moreover, not all flat classes are computationally inequivalent: two classes similar up to a diagonal unitary G = diag(ei1 , . . . , eiN ) have identical computational capabilities, because the local gauge transformation (of the first kind) (n) G e-in (n) merely changes the phase of the off-diagonal components of the Hamiltonian which are already nonzero, and cannot create new entanglement between qubits. In order to realize universal quantum computation, we need representatives from at least two gauge-inequivalent flat classes.
The -circulant matrices defined in (6) are of the form (A1), and constitute a flat class for each . Independent control over the energy levels is a prime motiva-

17

tion for using -rotation invariance, but we stress again

that this choice of symmetry is far from unique. Starting

from any nonsingular matrix [sr], defining the functions

r(g) = trix class

s gssr, and {diag(1(g), .

applying any unitary . . , N (g)) | g  RN }

U to the mawill produce

a commutative family of (Hermitian) Hamiltonian matri-

ces H(g) with eigenstates independent of g, and linearly

controlled eigenenergies r(g), i.e. a flat class. If symmetries other than -rotation invariance were preferred

for practical reasons, one would replace the diagonalizing

unitaries F and FD, defined in Eqs. (9),(10), with the

appropriate operations.

It is instructive to recast -rotations in terms of Sylvester's clock-and-shift matrices (also called Weyl's matrices or generalized Pauli matrices)

with  = ei/2. For k = 0, . . . , 3 we have the identity Z4kX4 = J . eik/2 The matrices {Z4kX4j }k,j=0,...,3 constitute a non-Hermitian trace-orthogonal basis for gl(4, C), and in fact the same is true of their obvious N dimensional generalization, with  = ei2/N , which span gl(N, C) and are orthogonal under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product. If N = 2, they reduce (up to a factor) to the Pauli matrices. The matrices XN and ZN are central to Weyl's formulation of periodic finite-dimensional quantum mechanics where they respectively correspond to finite position and momentum shifts:

XN = ei(2/N)p^, XN |x = |x - 1 mod N ZN = ei(2/N)x^, ZN | p = |p + 1 mod N

(A3)

where of course |x and |p are position and momentum eigenstates, respectively. Thus -rotation invariance is a symmetry in quantum (or optical) phase space, and is not found in other, internal-space generalizations of Pauli matrices like Pauli tensor products or Gell-Mann matrices.

In any dimension larger than 2, the eigenbases of

ZN , XN , and ZN XN are mutually unbiased : a measure-

ment in one (orthonormal) basis {|r } provides no in-

formation about measurements in another (orthonormal)

basis {|s

} because |

In par-

ticular when N = 4, the flat classes of Z4, X4 (the matrix

X in the main text), and Y4 (the matrix Y in the main

text) have mutually unbiased eigenbases {|m }, {|k },

and {|k } respectively. (See (15) and (21).)

ical or stochastic, in the core-to-lead couplings tc,i is a consequence of (B1) being invariant under tc,i  tc,ieii , bi,j  bi,j e-ii .

Fig. 13 for L odd (L = 11). In this symmetric case for which  = ~ , all eigenstates are either symmetric or
antisymmetric. This is seen from (C10), which becomes A/B = e-2i(L+1)(A/B)-1, implying

Substituting in (C9) gives L+1-j = ±j.We must consider two cases : when E is outside the energy band of

yielding e- = ± or e- = ±~ . The resulting expressions for j and L+1-j describe bound states localized at either dot and decaying exponentially with distance over the characteristic length -1. Moreover, the constraint equations for e- are equivalent to the fixed-point relations E =  ± |tc,1|2(E) and E = µ ± |tc,2|2(E), respectively. These relations can be obtained as normalizability conditions on the eigenstates of a dot connected to a semi-infinite lead, by solving the corresponding Schr¨odinger equation. Alternatively, the Green's function treatment of the core with semi-infinite leads, Appendix B, gives the same fixed-point relations as effective self-energies of the core once the leads are traced out. The bound state condition on  for E  2 amounts to

text. For E  -2, the condition on  gives instead

1. Bound states (E outside the band)

When E is outside the energy band of the leads, we have  = i if E > 2, and  =  + i if E < -2, where  = cosh-1(|E|/2) is a real parameter. Then

with ± = sgn(E), where N is a normalization factor, and where the eigenenergies satisfy the constraint

Alternatively, we can write the solution as

A generic feature of these bound states is their large am-

plitude at the dots. Because there are at least L states

from the continuous spectrum (see next section), there

are at most two bound states. The bound states for

L = 10 and  = µ = 2.5 are displayed in Fig.7 a,b of the

main text. The bound states for L = 11 are plotted in

Fig. 14 a,b.

where N is a normalization factor. For any finite L, there are L scattering states from the (perturbed) continuous spectrum of the lead. A generic feature of these L states is their small amplitude at the quantum dots. Additionally, there can be two scattering hybridized states. A generic feature of these states is their relatively large amplitude on the dots. The hybridized states for L = 10 and  = µ = 1.4 are displayed in Fig. 8 a,b. States from the (perturbed) continuous spectrum are displayed in Figs. 7 c,d, and 8 c,d. The hybridized states for L = 11 and  = µ = 1.2 are displayed in Fig. 14 c,d.
