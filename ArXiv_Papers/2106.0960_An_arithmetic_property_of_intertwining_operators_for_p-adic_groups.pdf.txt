1. Introduction
If one proposes to use the theory of Eisenstein cohomology to prove algebraicity results for the special values of automorphic L-functions as in my work with Harder [8], or its generalizations in my recent papers: [18], with Bhagwat [3], and with Krishnamurthy [13], then in a key step, one needs to prove that the normalised standard intertwining operator between induced representations for p-adic groups has a certain arithmetic property. The principal aim of this article is to address this particular local problem in the generality of the Langlands­Shahidi machinery; the main result of this article is invoked in [3] and [13], and I expect that it will be useful in future investigations on the arithmetic properties of automorphic L-functions.

Let F be a p-adic field, that is, a non-archimedean local field of characteristic 0 with finite residue field kF . Let G be a connected reductive group defined over F ; assume that G is quasi-split over F . Fix a choice of Borel subgroup B of G defined over F. Write B = TU, where T is a maximal torus, and U the unipotent radical of B; both defined over F. Suppose P is a maximal parabolic subgroup of G defined over F , assumed to be standard, i.e., containing B, and with Levi decomposition P = MN. Let A denote the maximal central split torus of M. The F -points of G, B, T, U, P, M, N, and A are denoted by G, B, T, U, P, M, N , and A, respectively. To emphasise the dependence on P , we also denote M = MP , N = NP , and A = AP . Let  be an irreducible admissible representation of MP . (In the applications we have in mind,  will be a local component of a global cuspidal automorphic representation of cohomological type.) Let IPG(s, ) be the induced representation as in the Langlands­ Shahidi theory [24]; the precise definitions are recalled in the main body of this article; for the introduction suffice it to say that it is obtained by normalised parabolic induction from P to G of  with the complex variable s introduced in a delicate manner. Let  be the set of simple roots of G with respect to B and P the unique simple root corresponding to P , and w0 the unique element in the Weyl group of G such that w0(\{P })   and w0(P ) < 0. Let Q be the parabolic subgroup of G associate to P , and w0 the corresponding representation of MQ. We denote Tst(s, ) : IPG(s, )  IQG(-s, w0) for the standard intertwining operator. There is a choice of measure implicit in the integral that defines the intertwining operator. Consider the Langlands dual groups: let LP  = LM LN  be the Levi decomposition of the parabolic subgroup LP  of LG corresponding to P . We write Ln = mj=1rj for the decomposition of Ln under the adjoint action of LM ; it is a multiplicity free direct sum. Given  and rj, the local aspects of the Langlands­Shahidi machinery attach a local L-factor L(s, , r~j) when  is generic, i.e., admits a Whittaker model. Denote by k the point of evaluation, which, by definition, is the point such that
IPG(s, )|s=k = aIndGP (),
where the right hand side is the algebraic (un-normalized) parabolic induction of  to a representation of G; see Def. 2.1.1. For brevity, let I = IPG(k, ) = aIndGP () and I~ = IQG(-k, w0).
Now we impose an arithmetic context: suppose E is a `large enough' finite Galois extension of Q, and suppose there is a smooth absolutely-irreducible admissible representation (, V,E ) of MP on an E-vector space V,E such that for some embedding  : E  C we have  = . The induced modules I0 = aIndGP () and I~0 = IQG(-k, w0 ) give E-structures on I and I~, i.e., the canonical I0 E, C  I and I~0 E, C  I~ are isomorphisms. For the parabolic subgroup P , assume (i) the local Langlands correspondence to be known for MP ; this is a serious condition which is met in a lot of examples, and widely expected to hold in all generality with prescribed desiderata, and (ii) that P satisfies an integrality property: P |AP  X(AP ) ­ see Sect. 2 for notations not defined in the introduction. For the representation , motivated by global considerations, assume (i)  to be unitary up to a half-integral Tate twist, (ii)  to be essentially tempered, (iii) the point of evaluation s = k to be `on the right of the unitary axis' (Def. 2.4.3) that guarantees absolute convergence of the integral defining the standard intertwining operator at s = k; and (iv)  is generic. The first main result (Thm. 3.3.7) of this article is an arithmeticity result for the standard intertwining operator at the point of evaluation s = k, i.e., there is an E-linear G-equivariant map Tarith : I0  I~0 such that
Tst(s, )|s=k = Tarith E, C.

The proof involves keeping track of arithmeticity in the proof of a rationality result for the standard intertwining operator for p-adic groups due to Waldspurger [25, Thm. IV.I.I].

The integrality property on P seems to tie up remarkably with motivic considerations; this
is already very interesting in the example (see Sec. 5.1) of G = GL(N ) and P maximal such that MP = GL(n) × GL(n) in which case this integrality translates to nn  0 (mod 2) which is exactly the condition in [8] imposed therein due to motivic considerations.

Consider the normalised standard intertwining operator defined as:

(1.0.1)

Tnorm(s, )

=


m

j=1

L(js, L(js +

, r~j 1, ,

) r~j

)

-1 

Tst(s,

),

(s)  0.

Continuing with all the hypotheses as above, at the point of evaluation s = k, the local Lvalues L(jk, , r~j) and L(jk + 1, , r~j) are finite; and hence Tnorm(s, )|s=k is convergent. We
impose a `criticality' condition on s = k that imposes a half-integrality property on k and

is entirely a function of the parabolic subgroup P and the ambient group G. This condition

has a global motivation in that the corresponding global L-values at s = k are critical values

in the sense of Deligne [6], and like the integrality condition on P it restricts the scope of

global applications; see, for example, the interesting case of G = Sp(2n) and MP = GL(n) in Sec. 5.3 that involves the exterior square L-functions for GL(n). The arithmeticity result

on local critical L-values for Rankin­Selberg L-functions [17, Prop. 3.17] gives the impetus to

hypothesize that

L(sj, , r~j)  (E), sj  {jk, jk + 1},

and furthermore this L-value is Galois equivariant; see Hyp. 4.2.1. Under such a hypothesis,

which can be verified in many examples such as when G is a classical group, the main result

in Thm. 3.3.7 can be strengthened to Thm. 4.3.1 that gives an arithmeticity result for the

normalised standard intertwining operator at the point of evaluation.

The results of this article (Thm. 3.3.7 and Thm. 4.3.1) say that if we use Eisenstein cohomology to give a cohomological interpretation of Langlands's constant term theorem, and so attempt to prove a rationality result for ratios of critical values of automorphic L-functions, then at any given finite place we do not pick up any possibly-transcendental period. Suppose  is an unramified representation, i.e., has a vector fixed under the hyper-special maximal compact subgroup of MP , then both I and I~ are also unramified; suppose f0  I (resp., f~0  I~) is the normalised spherical vector; then Langlands's generalization of the classical Gindikin­Karpelevic formula says that Tnorm(f0) = f~0. This implies the theorem because the E-structures are generated by these normalised spherical vectors. The real content of the theorem is that it works for any  whether or not it is unramified. Whereas the global theory of Eisenstein cohomology and the special values of automorphic L-functions provides the context, this article is purely local (p-adic) in nature, and does not need the reader to be familiar with such global aspects.

2. Local aspects of the Langlands­Shahidi machinery

2.1. Induced representations and `the point of evaluation'. Let P be the modulus character of P ; it is trivial on NP and its values on MP is given by:
P (m) = | det(AdNP (m))|, m  MP ,
where AdNP : MP  GL(Lie(NP )) is the adjoint representation of MP on the Lie algebra of NP , and | | is the normalised absolute value on F . Let Z(MP ) be the centre of MP , AP the maximal split torus in Z(MP ). Let X(AP ) = Hom(AP , F ) and X(MP ) = Hom(MP , F ) denote the group of rational characters of AP and MP . Restriction from MP to AP gives an inclusion X(MP )  X(AP ), which induces an isomorphism X(MP ) Z Q = X(AP ) Z Q. The modulus character P is naturally an element of aP := X(AP ) Z R. Fix a Weyl group invariant inner product ( , ) on X(AP ) Z R.
Let G be the set of all roots which are naturally in X(T ); for the choice of the Borel subgroup B, let +G be the set of positive roots, and G the set of simple roots. Let P be half the sum of all positive roots whose root spaces are in Lie(NP ); via the restriction from T to AP we have P  X(AP ) Z Q. We have the equality:
|2P (m)| = P (m), m  M.

Let aP = Hom(X(AP ), R) = Hom(X(MP ), R) denote the real Lie algebra of AP , and HP : MP  aP denote the Harish-Chandra homomorphism defined by:
exp , HP (m) := |(m)|,   X(AP ), m  M.
In particular, taking  = P , we get: exp P , HP (m) = P (m)1/2, m  M.

Let (, V) be an irreducible admissible representation of MP ; the representation space V is a vector space over C. For   aP R C, define the induced representation
I(, ) := IndGP (  exp( , HP ( ) )  1U ),

where Ind means normalised parabolic induction. The representation space V (, ) is the vector space of all smooth (i.e., locally constant) functions f : G  V such that

f (mng) = (m) exp(  + P , HP (m) )f (g), g  G, m  M, n  N.

Recall that P is a maximal parabolic subgroup, defined by a simple root P which is the

unique simple root whose root space is in Lie(NP ). Set

P , P

=

2

(P (P

,P ,P

) )

and

put

P := ~P :=

1 P , P

P .

In the Langlands­Shahidi machinery the notation ~ is commonly used; elsewhere in the arith-

metic theory of automorphic forms the notation P is commonly used; it is the fundamental weight corresponding to the simple root P . For s  C, define s as:

s := s~P =

s P , P

P .

Let I(s, ) := I(s~P , ), whose representation space V (s, ) := V (s~P , ) consists of all locally constant functions f : G  V such that

Definition 2.1.1 (Point of evaluation). Define the point of evaluation k as

k := - P , P ,
which depends only on P and G, and has the property that I(k, ) = aIndGP () which is the algebraic (i.e., un-normalised) parabolic induction from P to G of the representation .

The

point

of

evaluation

k

is

half-integral,

i.e.,

k



Z

or

k



1 2

+ Z,

or

more

succinctly

2k  Z, since , P = 2(, P )/(P , P )  Z for any root . In general, k can be integral

or a genuine half-integer; for example, if G = GL(N ) with N  2, and P is any maximal

parabolic subgroup, then k = -N/2; see Sec. 5.1.

2.2. The standard intertwining operator: definition and analytic properties. For
the maximal parabolic subgroup P = P, where  =  \ {P }, recall that w0 is the unique element in the Weyl group such that w0()   and w0(P ) < 0; let Q = Pw0() be the maximal parabolic subgroup associate to P . Then MQ = w0MP w0-1, and let w0 be the representation of MQ given by conjugation.
Let f  IPG(s, ) and g  G. Suppose there exists a vector v in the inducing representation of IQG(-s, w0), such that for all v in the contragredient of this inducing representation the integral NQ f (w0-1ng), v dn converges absolutely to v, v then define NQ f (w0-1ng) dn = v. If this is verified for all f  IPG(s, ) and all g  G then define an intertwining operator for G-modules
Tst(s) : IPG(s, ) - IQG(-s, w0 )
by the integral

(2.2.1)

Tst(s)(f )(g) =

f (w0-1ng) dn; f  V (s, ), g  G.

NQ

Assume, here and henceforth, that the measures in such intertwining integrals are chosen to be

Q-valued. The operator Tst(s) is denoted as A(s, , w0) in Shahidi [24, Sec. 4.1] (see also Kim [11, Sec. 4.3]). That Tst(s)(f )  IQG(-s, w0) is verified in loc. cit. The following convergence statement is a special case of [24, Prop. 4.1.2]:

Proposition 2.2.2. If (s)  0 then Tst(s)(f )(g) converges absolutely for all g  G and all f  V (s, ).

If Tst(s)(f )(g) converges absolutely for all g  G and all f  V (s, ), then we will simply say that Tst(s) converges absolutely. One can be more specific about the domain of convergence in the tempered case:

Proposition 2.2.3. If  is a tempered (unitary) representation, then the standard intertwining operator Tst(s) converges absolutely for (s) > 0.

The above convergence statements are contained in Harish-Chandra's work on harmonic analysis on p-adic reductive groups; the reader is referred to Shahidi [19, Sect. 2.2] and the references therein; see also Kim [11, Prop. 12.3].

Without worrying about convergence, let us see the shape of the standard intertwining

operator at the point of evaluation s = k. The domain of Tst(s)|s=k, as noted above, is I(k, ) = aIndGP (). The codomain is IQG(-s, w0) := I(-s~Q, w0), whose representation space consists of all locally constant functions f  : G  Vw0 = V such that

where w0(m) = (w0-1mw0). Put s = k = - P , P ; since Q, Q = P , P we get: f (mug) = w0(m) Q(m) f (g).

Hence, at the point of evaluation, in terms of un-normalised induction we get:

(2.2.4)

Tst(s)|s=k : aIndGP () - aIndGQ(w0  Q).

2.3. Local factors and the local Langlands correspondence. A defining aspect of the Langlands program is Langlands's computation ([14, Sect. 5]) of the constant term of an Eisenstein series, which at a local unramified place boils down to computing the standard intertwining operator on `the' spherical vector which is a scalar multiple of the spherical vector on the other side, and this scalar multiple is an expression denoted M (s) in loc. cit. Langlands says that J. Tits pointed out to him how to express M (s) in a more convenient form. This is now an important ingredient in the Langlands­Shahidi machinery; see Shahidi [20, Sect. 2].

Let LG be the complex reductive group which is the connected component of the Langlands dual LG of G; see Borel [4, I.2]; and let LP be the parabolic subgroup of LG corresponding to P , and LN its unipotent radical. The Levi quotient LM  of LP  acts on the Lie algebra Ln of LN  by the adjoint action. There is a positive integer m such that the set { ~P ,  } ­ as  varies over positive roots such that the root space Lg() of the dual root  is in Ln ­ is
{1, . . . , m}. For each 1  j  m put

(2.3.1)

Vj = span of Lg() for  such that ~P ,  = j.

Then the action of LM  on Ln stabilizes each Vj and furthermore acts irreducibly on Vj. Denote rj the action of LM  on Vj, and Ln = mj=1rj is a multiplicity free decomposition as an LM -representation. Let r~j denote the contragredient of rj.

Given a smooth irreducible admissible representation  that is generic, i.e., has a Whittaker
model, and for 1  j  m, the local aspects of the Langlands­Shahidi machinery attaches a local L-factor L(s, , r~j) (see Shahidi [21]) which is the inverse of a polynomial in q-s of degree at most dj := dim(Vj); when  is unramified this degree is dj.
Let WF be the Weil group of F , and WF = WF × SL2(C) the Weil­Deligne group. The local Langlands correspondence for G says that to  corresponds its Langlands parameter which is an admissible homomorphism  : WF  LMP ; see Borel [4, Sect. 8] for the requirements on the parameter . Composing with r~j gives r~j   : WF  LGLdj , an admissible homomorphism which parametrizes, via the local Lanlgands correspondence for GLdj (F ), a smooth irreducible admissible representation of GLdj (F ) that we denote r~j(). As in Shahidi [23, p. 3] we will impose the working hypothesis:

(2.3.2)

L(s, , r~j ) = L(s, r~j()),

that is known in a number of instances; see the references in loc. cit.

2.4. The notion of being on the right of the unitary axis. Recall that  is a smooth irreducible admissible representation of MP , which is to be a local component of a globally generic cuspidal automorphic representation (needed by the context in which we can evoke the Langlands­Shahidi machinery), and keeping the generalised Ramanujan conjecture in the back of our minds (see, for example, Shahidi [22]), we will impose the condition that  is essentially tempered, i.e., tempered mod the centre.

subgroup of MP generated by all compact subgroups. F  × · · · × F , and i : AP  F  is the projection

to the i-th copy. Define A1P  AP similar to MP1 ; we have A1P = AP  MP1 . Let X(MP ) =

HXo(mM(PM) P=/MXP1(,ACP)).;

similarly, X(AP ). Given z = (z1, . . .

,

Restricting from MP to AP gives an isomorphism zl)  Cl, we get an unramified character AP  C

given by |1|z1  · · ·  |l|zl, and via X(MP ) = X(AP ) an unramified character of MP which

we will denote as z. Given  as above, tempered modulo the centre means that there exist

exponents e = (e1, . . . , el)  Rl and a smooth irreducible unitary tempered representation t such that  = t e. (Keeping global applications in mind, we will impose later a hypothesis

that the exponents ei are (half-)integral.) The representation r~j() of GLdj (F ), obtained by functoriality, is also tempered modulo its centre. A few words of explanation might be helpful. There is an exponent f~j = f (r~j, e1, . . . , el)  R, that depends on the representation rj and the
exponents e1, . . . , el, such that

r~j() = r~j()t  | det |f~j ,

with r~j()t = r~j(t) being a unitary tempered irreducible representation of GLdj (F ). Local functoriality preserves temperedness, by the desiderata in Borel [4, 10.4, (4)], and the one has

to keep track of the central characters for which consider the diagram:

WF  / LMO P

r~j

L(GLdj )

Since the representation r~j is irreducible, the explaining the bottom horizontal arrow. The

centre LAP = (C)l unramified character

of e

LMP acts via scalars, of AP corresponds to

its Satake parameter e in LAP ; we get r~j(e)  C, which corresponds to an unramified

character | |f~j of F , or the character | det |f~j of GLdj (F ), for some exponent f~j which, a priori,

lives in C, but since ej  R and r~j is an algebraic representation, it is clear that f~j  R.

Lemma 2.4.2. With notations as above we have f~j = j · f~1.

Proof. The proof follows from the definition of Vj in (2.3.1) which is the representation space for rj. (It is instructive to see this detail in the example discussed in Sec. 5.3.)

Definition 2.4.3. Let  be a smooth irreducible admissible generic representation of MP that is tempered modulo the centre with exponents e1, . . . , el  R. We say  is on the right of the unitary axis with respect to the ambient group G, if
- P , P + f~1 > 0.
By Lem. 2.4.2 it follows that for each 1  j  m we have: -j P , P + f~j > 0.
Corollary 2.4.4. Let  be a smooth irreducible admissible generic representation of MP that is tempered modulo the centre with exponents e1, . . . , el  R, and which is on the right of the unitary axis with respect to the ambient group G, then the local L-values
L(jk, , r~j ) and L(jk + 1, , r~j )
are finite for each 1  j  m, where, recall that k = - P , P is the point of evaluation.

8

A. RAGHURAM

Proof. If  is a unitary tempered representation of GLd(F ) then the standard local L-factor L(s, ) is finite if (s) > 0; this follows from Jacquet's classification of tempered representations of GLd(F ) and the well-known inductive recipe for local L-factors that is succinctly summarised in Kudla [12]. The proof follows from the equalities: L(jk, , r~j ) = L(jk, r~j ()) = L(jk + f~j, r~j()t).
The condition of being on the right of the unitary axis is tailor-made to appeal to Shahidi's tempered L-functions conjecture that is now a theorem after the work of many authors (see [24, p. 147]) culminating in Heiermann­Opdam [9].

3. An arithmetic variation on a rationality result of Waldspurger
In this section we recall a rationality result of Waldspurger [25, Thm. IV.1.1], and show how to reformulate it so that the statement works at an arithmetic level. Before that let us clarify some terminology that apparently causes some confusion.
3.1. Digression on the adjectives: rationality, algebraicity, and arithmeticity. First of all, even among experts, there seems to be no universal agreement on the precise meaning of these adjectives. In this article, all three words are used, and it might help the reader to clarify their meanings. The word rationality has two meanings and the context usually makes it clear. First of all, a result of the form "(L - value)/(periods)  Q" is often called a rationality result for L-values. Then there is a common abuse of terminology and a result of the form "(L - value)/(periods)  Q" is also called a rationality result. We will refer to the latter as an algebraicity result for L-values. A second usage of rationality, as in the context of Waldspurger's result, comes from algebraic geometry and means that some function or operator at hand is a rational function on an algebraic variety. To explain our usage of the word arithmetic, suppose we have an L-value at hand, which is the value at s = s0 of the L-function L(s, ) attached to some object  defined over C, for example,  can a cuspidal automorphic representation. We may set up our context for the object  to have an arithmetic origin, i.e., there is an object  defined over some coefficient field E, such that for some embedding of fields  : E  C, the base-change  of  via  is the object . In such a context a result of the form "L(s0, )/(periods)  (E)" is given the appellation of an arithmetic result for L-values. With this explanation of the words, the purpose of this section is to show that Waldspurger's rationality result for intertwining operator has an arithmetic origin. We will use the word arithmeticity for the behaviour of an arithmetic result upon changing , or equivalently, by replacing  by    for any   Gal(Q¯ /Q); this is compatible with the usage of arithmeticity as in [7].
3.2. A rationality result of Waldspurger. In this subsection we will adumbrate the presentation in [25, IV.1]. Recall the notations MP1 , A1P , X(MP ), and X(AP ) from Sect. 2.4. When P is fixed we drop the subscript P from MP , AP , etc.
Note that X(M ) has the structure of an algebraic variety over C; denote by B the C-algebra of polynomial functions on X(M ). Let (, V ) be a smooth admissible representation of M on a C-vector space V , and let OC = {  :   X(M )}. A function f : OC  C is a polynomial if there exists b  B such that f (  ) = b(). For an open set U  OC, a function f : U  C is a rational function if there exists b1, b2  B such that b1()f (  ) = b2() for all   X(M ) with     U and b1() = 0.

Rationality of the intertwining operators may be formulated in another way that is used
in the proof of [25, Thm. IV.1.1], and which will allow us to descend the statement and proof
to an arithmetic level to give us Thm. 3.3.7 below. For m  M , let bm  B be defined as bm() = (m). Define VB = V C B on which M acts as: B(m)(v  b) = (m)v  bmb. For   X(M ), let B be the maximal ideal {b  B : b() = 0}. Then the action of M on VB B/B is the representatoin   . Similarly, IPG(VB) = IPG(V ) C B. Let sp : B  B  B/B =    denote the specialization map; same notation also for sp : IPG(B)  IPG(  ). The collection {A(  )}OC of operators is polynomial if and only if there exists a Gequivariant homormorphism of B-modules AB : IPG(B)  IPG(B) such that the following diagram commutes

P  with the same Levi as P , let P¯ denote its opposing parabolic subgroup. (This P¯ is the Q from before.) The following theorem is contained in [25, Thm. IV.1.1].

Theorem 3.2.5. Suppose  is an irreducible admissible smooth representation of M . Then there is an open cone U = {  X(M ) : (),  > 0,   (P )(P¯)} of X(M ) such that J(  ) is defined by the convergent integral (3.2.4) for   U . The collection of intertwining operators {J(  )}U on this cone is rational.

It is the rationality assertion in the above theorem that we are particularly interested in (since convergence in our context is already guaranteed by Prop. 2.2.2). We summarise the key steps of its proof, and refer the reader to [25, IV.1] for all the details and also for some of the notations used below even if not defined here because it would take us too far to systematically define them.

(1) (Reduction step.) We need a G-equivariant homomorphism of B-modules
JB : IPG(B)  IPG(B)
as in (3.2.2), that satisfies the requirement of (3.2.3). Frobenius reciprocity for Jacquet modules and parabolic induction gives:
HomG,B(IPG(B), IPG(B)) = HomM,B(IPG(B)P , B),
where, IPG(B)P  is the Jacquet module of IPG(B) with respect to P  on which the action of M is the canonical action twisted by P-1/2 to account for normalised parabolic induction. It suffices then to construct
jB  HomM,B(IPG(B)P , B)
such that the associated map JB via Frobenius reciprocity satisfies (3.2.3).
(2) (Exponents in the Jacquet module of an induced representation.) By the well-known results of Bernstein and Zelevinskii [2, 2.12] (see also [25, I.3]), the Jacquet module IPG(B)P  is filtered by (M, B)-submodules {Fw,P }wPW P , indexed by a certain totally ordered set P W P of representatives in the Weyl group, such that for the successive quotients we have an isomorphism
qw : Fw,P /Fw+,P   IMMw·P (w · VB,M w-1·P  ),
the right hand side being a parabolically induced module of M . Consider these successive quotients for the action of the split centre AP of M ; and let Expw be the set of exponents, which are characters AP  B×, that appear in the (co-)domain of qw. We may suppose that 1  P W P ; the image of q1 is VB. For any w  P W P , if w = 1 then Expw  Exp1 = ; see [25, p. 280].
(3) (Killing all sub-quotients except one.) Using the theory of resultants, Waldspurger constructs R  B[AP ] and b  B such that R maps the Jacquet module IPG(B)P  into F1,P  and on each of the generalised eigenspace for µ  Exp1 appearing in F1,P  /F1+,P   Frac(B) it acts as homothety by the element b. The required element jB as in (1) is the composition of R followed by F1,P   F1,P /F1+,P  -q1 VB.

3.3. An arithmetic variant of Thm. 3.2.5. Let E be a `large enough' finite Galois ex-
tension of Q. The meaning of large enough will be explained in context. Let XE(M ) = Hom(M/M 1, E); similarly, XE(A). Restriction from M to A gives an isomorphism XE(M ) = XE(A). If A = F  × · · · × F , l-copies, then A/A1 = FZ × · · · × FZ , with FZ being the multiplicative infinite cyclic group generated by the uniformizer F . Also, XE(A) = E × · · · × E, where t = (t1, . . . , tl)  E × · · · × E corresponds to the character t that maps a = (a1, . . . , al)  A to tiordF (ai). An embedding of fields  : E  C, gives a map  : XE(M )  XC(M ) where  =   . The following diagram might help the reader:

Similarly, BC(M ) = C[w1, w1-1, . . . , wl, wl-1] = C[qs1, q-s1, . . . , qsl, q-sl]. Base-change via the embedding  gives: BE(M ) E, C = BC(M ). To homogenise with the notations of [25] as used

in Sec. 3.2, abbreviate XC(M ) and BC(M ) as X(M ) and B, respectively.

3.3.1. Hypotheses we impose on a representation in the main result have an arithmetic origin. Let (, V,E ) be a smooth absolutely irreducible admissible representation of M over an E-vector space V,E. For an embedding of fields  : E  C, we have the irreducible admissible representation  of M on the C-vector space V := V,E E, C. We may apply the considerations of Sect. 2 to (, V). We explicate below all the hypotheses we impose on the representation  in the main result Thm. 3.3.7; these hypotheses are motivated by our global applications, and are expected to have an arithmetic origin.
The global context of a cohomological cuspidal automorphic representation suggests, via purity considerations, the following hypothesis on . Recall that for exponents e = (e1, . . . , el)  Rl, by e  X(A) = X(M ) defined as: e(a) = i |ai|ei for a = (a1, . . . , al)  A.
Hypothesis 3.3.1 (Arithmeticity for half-integral unitarity). Let (, V,E ) be a smooth absolutely irreducible admissible representation of a reductive p-adic group M over an E-vector space V,E. If for one embedding  : E  C, there exists an l-tuple of integers w = (w1, . . . , wl) such that the representation   w/2 is unitary then for every embedding  : E  C, the representation   w/2 is unitary.
The proof is easy and we leave it to the reader. It makes sense to call a  satisfying the above hypothesis as half-integrally unitary.
Hypothesis 3.3.2 (Arithmeticity for essential-temperedness). Let (, V,E ) be a smooth, absolutely irreducible, admissible, half-integrally unitary representation of a reductive p-adic group M over an E-vector space V,E. If for one embedding  : E  C the representation  is essentially tempered, then for every embedding  : E  C the representation  is essentially tempered.

Proof of Hyp. 3.3.2 for GLn(F ). For GLn(F ) this follows from the considerations in Clozel [5] while using Jacquet's classification of tempered representations [10]; such a proof is well-known to experts and so we will just sketch the details. The reader is also referred to [16, Sect. 9.2] for a summary of the classification of tempered representations that we will use below. For a representation  of GLn(F ) and t  R, (t) denotes   | |t.
(1) Any tempered representation  of G = GLn(F ) is fully induced from discrete series representations; it is of the form:

 = IndGPn1,...,nr (F )(1  · · ·  r), where i is a discrete series representation of GLni (F ); i ni = n; Pn1,...,nr (F ) is the parabolic subgroup of G with Levi subgroup GLn1(F ) × · · · × GLnr (F ). (2) A discrete series representation i of GLni(F ) is of the form
i = Q((i, bi)),

where ni = aibi, with ai, bi  Z1; i is a supercuspidal representation of GLai (F )

such

that

i

(

bi-1 2

)

is

unitary,

and

Q((i, bi))

is

the

quotient

of

IndGPbLi,n..i.(,bFi

) (F

)

(i



i(1)



·

·

·



i(bi

Q((i, bi)).

In both the steps the parabolic induction used is normalised induction which is not, in general,

Galois equivariant. As in Clozel [5], we may force Galois equivariance by considering a half-

integral Tate twisted version of induction. Using the notations of (1), but letting for the

moment i be any irreducible admissible representation of GLni(F ), define:

T IndGPn1,...,nr (F )(1  · · ·  r) := IndGPn1,...,nr (F )

1(

1

- 2

n1

)



·

·

·



r

(

(

).

Suppose   Aut(C); then one may verify that

 (T IndGPn1,...,nr (F )(1  · · ·  r)) = T IndGPn1,...,nr (F )( 1  · · ·   r).
Define a quadratic character of F  as  := (  | |1/2)/| |1/2; it is trivial if and only if  fixes q1/2, where q is the cardinality of the residue field of F . Then:

 IndGPn1,...,nr (F )(1  · · ·  r) = IndGPn1,...,nr (F )((1  n -n1 )  · · ·  (r  n -nr )). Similarly, using Lem. 3.2.1 and the few lines following that lemma in [5], we have:

 Q((i, bi)) = Q(( i  ai(bi-1), bi)).

Of course each  i is supercuspidal and so also is any of its quadratic twists; furthermore,

( i

is

unitary.

Hence the  -conjugate

of the tempered representation



is

tempered.

Using the notations in the hypothesis, take  = , and if  : E  C is any other embedding then take   Aut(C) such that  =  . By assumption  = t | |w/2 for a unitary tempered

representation and an integral exponent w. Then

(3.3.3)

  =  t  (  | |w/2) = ( t  w )  | |w/2;

By the above argument  t is tempered, and hence so also is  t  w .

Remarks on the proof of Hyp. 3.3.2 for classical groups. For classical groups, using similar argument as in the case of GLn(F ), and result for GLn(F ), a proof follows from Moeglin and Tadic's classification [15] for discrete series and tempered representations. The proof is tedious. We will sketch the argument for even-orthogonal groups.
Consider G = O2n(F ) = {g  GL2n(F ) : tg · J · g = J} the split even orthogonal group of rank n, where Ji,j = (i, 2n - j + 1). Suppose n = a1 + · · · + aq + n0, with a1, . . . , aq  1 and n0  0, and P(a1,...,aq;n0) is the parabolic subgroup of O2n(F ) with Levi subgroup
M(a1,...,aq;n0) = GLa1 (F ) × · · · × GLaq (F ) × O2n0(F ).
Let 0 be a discrete series representation of O2n0(F ) and j an essentially discrete series representation of GLaj (F ). For brevity, let
1 × · · · × q  0 := IndGP(a1,...,aq;n0) (1  · · ·  q  0).
This induced representation is a multiplicity-free direct sum of tempered representations (see Moeglin­Tadic [15, Thm. 13.1] and Atobe­Gan [1, Desideratum 3.9, (6)]). Suppose  is one such tempered representation:   1 × · · · × q  0. Suppose mh1,...,hq,x  M with hj  GLaj (F ) and x  O2n0(F ), then the absolute-value of the determinant of the adjoint action of mh1,...,hq,x on the Lie algebra of the unipotent radical of P is given by:

P (mh1,...,hq,x) = | det(h1)|2n-2a1 | det(h2)|2n-2(a1+a2) . . . | det(hq)|2n0 ·

· | det(h1)|a1-1| det(h2)|a2-1 . . . | det(hq)|aq-1 .

Using this, for   Aut(C), one may verify that:

(3.3.4)

    (1 × · · · × q  0) = ( 1  a1-1) × · · · × ( q  aq-1)   0.

By appealing to the above proof for GLn0(F ), we know that each  j, and so also its quadratic twist  1  a1-1, is an essentially discrete series representation. Hence, proof of arithmeticity for tempered representation of O2n(F ) boils down to proving arithmeticity for discrete series
representation of O2n0(F ).

For the discrete series representation 0 of O2n0(F ), there exist a and n1 such that n0 = a + n1, and there exist an essentially discrete series representation  of GLa(F ) and a discrete series representation 1 of the smaller even-orthogonal group O2n1(F ) such that 0 is one of two possible subrepresentations of   1; and both these sub-representations are in the discrete series; this being the crux of [15]. Then, as above       a-1   1. An induction argument (see [15, p. 721]) concludes the proof as the reduction to a smaller even-orthogonal
group ends with the case of 1 being a supercuspidal representation (in loc. cit. called the weak cuspidal support of 0), and clearly conjugation by  preserves supercuspidality as it leaves the support of a matrix coefficient unchanged.

It is an interesting problem to prove this for a general p-adic group. Assuming that Hyp. 3.3.2 is true, we can then formulate another hypothesis:

Hypothesis 3.3.5 (Arithmeticity for being on the right of the unitary axis). Let (, V,E ) be a smooth, absolutely irreducible, admissible, half-integrally unitary, essentially tempered
representation of a reductive p-adic group M over an E-vector space V,E. If for one embedding  : E  C the representation  is to the right of the unitary axis, then for every embedding  : E  C the representation  is to the right of the unitary axis.

14

A. RAGHURAM

For GLn(F ) this follows from (3.3.3) since the exponent for  and   are equal. Similarly, the above hypothesis will follow from Hyp. 3.3.2 that the half-integral exponents w/2 for  are independent of ; in particular the exponent f1 of r~1() would be independent of .

Lemma 3.3.6 (Arithmeticity for genericity). Let (, V,E ) be a smooth absolutely irreducible admissible representation of a reductive quasi-split p-adic group M over an E-vector space V,E. If for one embedding  : E  C the representation  is generic, then for every embedding  : E  C the representation  is generic.
Proof. Suppose  :   C is a Whittaker functional with respect to a character  : U  C (that is nontrivial on all the root spaces corresponding to simple roots). Given another embedding  : E  C, there exists   Aut(C) such that  =   . Then    is a Whittaker functional for  with respect to the character    of U .
After the above hypotheses and lemma, it makes sense to say that a smooth absolutelyirreducible admissible representation (, V,E ) of a reductive p-adic group M is half-integrally unitary, essentially tempered, to the right of the unitary axis, or generic, if for some, and hence any, embedding  : E  C the representation  is half-integrally unitary, essentially tempered, to the right of the unitary axis, or generic, respectively. The first main theorem of this article is the following result.
3.3.2. An arithmetic variant of Thm. 3.2.5.
Theorem 3.3.7. Let P = M N be a maximal parabolic subgroup of a connected reductive p-adic group G. Let (, V,E ) be a smooth absolutely-irreducible admissible representation of M over an E-vector space V,E. Assume that E is large enough to contain the values of the exponents of A that appear in the Jacquet module of aIndGP () with respect to the associate parabolic subgroup Q. Assuming Hyp. 3.3.1, Hyp. 3.3.2, and Hyp. 3.3.5, we suppose that  is half-integrally unitary, essentially tempered, to the right of the unitary axis, and generic. Suppose that P satisfies the integrality condition: P |AP  X(AP ), then so does Q and the modular character Q takes values in Q. There exists an E-linear G-equivariant map
Tst,E : aIndGP () - aIndGQ(  Q)
such that for any embedding  : E  C we have:
Tst,E E, 1C = Tst,,
where Tst, = Tst(s, )|s=k : aIndGP ()  aIndGQ(  Q) is the standard intertwining operator at the point of evaluation.
Proof. Fix an  : E  C. For   X(M ), we have the standard intertwining operator
Tst(, ) : IPG(  )  IQG(w0 (  ))
given by an integral where it converges. We will ultimately specialize to the point k corresponding to the point of evaluation k = - P , P ; note that k = -P ; at this point our hypothesis guarantees convergence. Consider Thm. 3.2.5 with the small variation that we take the associate parabolic Q and not P  which required MP  = MP ; for Q we have MQ is the w0-conjugate of MP . This causes no problem as long as we use the correct integral, i.e., we use (2.2.1) instead of (3.2.4). From Thm. 3.2.5 we get a (G, B)-module map
TB : IPG( C B) - IQG(w0 C B)
that satisfies (3.2.3) with a homothety element b  B.

4. Arithmeticity of local critical L-values

The purpose of this section is to formulate an arithmeticity hypothesis on local critical L-values for automorphic L-functions. It is a generalization of [17, Prop. 3.17] which was in the context of Rankin­Selberg L-functions and was a crucial ingredient in the proof of the main theorem of that article. Using this hypothesis we may strengthen Thm. 3.3.7 to give an arithmeticity result for the normalised standard intertwining operator.

4.1. Criticality condition on the point of evaluation. In the context of Rankin­Selberg

L-functions one takes MP = GLn × GLn as a Levi subgroup of an ambient G = GLN , where N = n + n. The integrality condition on P forces nn to be even. For an inducing data  × 

of MP , the critical set for the L-function L(s,  ×v) consists of integers if n  n (mod 2) and

consists of half-integers,

i.e.,

elements of

1 2

Z

if

(mod

2);

see [8, Def. 7.3].

The purpose

of this subsection is to formalise such parity constraints in the context of Langlands-Shahidi

machinery.

Suppose Ai = i(A) = F  and A is the internal product A1 × · · · × Al; correspondingly, suppose M = M1 · · · Ml an almost direct product of reductive subgroups, with Ai in the centre
of Mi. Let Mi be half the sum of positive roots for Mi. If Mi is integral, then put Mi = 0. If Mi is not integral, then necessarily 2Mi is integral, and put Mi = 1. Fix an unramified character PP /2  Hom(M/M 1, C) = Hom(A/A1, C), defined by

PP /2(a1, . . . , al) := |a1|M1 /2 . . . |al|Ml/2, (a1, . . . , al)  A = F  × · · · × F .

Let

such

that r~j(P ) = q-hj or that r~j(PP /2) = | |hj . Let  be an irreducible admissible half-integrally

unitary, essentially-tempered, generic representation of MP . Consider   PP /2; we have:

L(s, , r~j ) = L(s - hj ,   PP /2, r~j ).

The idea is that given , we algebrise it by considering the twist   PP /2. For GLn this is equivalent to replacing  by   | |n/2, where n  {0, 1} and n  n - 1 (mod 2). Any point of evaluation of a global L-function attached to an algebraic data (think of a motivic

L-function) should be an integer for the L-value to be critical in the sense of Deligne [6]. This

motivates the following definition which is independent of  and depends only on (G, P ).

16

A. RAGHURAM

Definition 4.1.1. Let G be a connected reductive p-adic group and P a maximal parabolic subgroup. We say that P is critical for G if the point of evaluation k = - P , P satisfies the condition:
jk  hj + Z,  1  j  m.

4.2. Hypothesis on local critical L-values. We can now formulate the arithmeticity hypothesis for local critical L-values.

Hypothesis 4.2.1. Let G be a connected reductive p-adic group and P a maximal parabolic subgroup. Assume that P satisfies the following two conditions:
(i) the integrality condition: P |AP  X(AP ); and
(ii) the criticality condition: P is critical for G.
Let  be a smooth, absolutely-irreducible, half-integrally unitary, essentially-tempered, admissible, generic representation of MP over a field of coefficients E. Let k = - P , P be the point of evaluation, and let sj  {jk, jk + 1} for any 1  j  m. Then for any embedding  : E  C we have:
(1) L(sj, , r~j)  (E), and furthermore (2) for any   Gal(Q¯ /Q) we have  (L(sj, , r~j)) = L(sj, , r~j).

As already mentioned, this hypothesis can be verified in some various concrete examples of interest. We briefly mention two examples below; these contexts are amplified in Sect. 5; the reader will readily appreciate that such examples may be generalised.

Example 4.2.2 (Local L-functions for GLn(F )). If  is an irreducible admissible representation of GLn(F ) then it follows from Clozel [5, Lem. 4.6] that for any k0  Z and any   Aut(C)

one has:



L(k0

+

1-n 2

,

)

=

L(k0

+

1-n 2

,

 ).

The reader can check that Hyp. 4.2.1 follows from this Galois equivariance after appealing to

the details in Sect. 5.1. Such a Galois equivariance can be reformulated as

 (L(k0, )) = L(k0,    n-1),

which is useful in other situations; see the next example below.

Example 4.2.3 (Local L-functions for O2n(F )). Suppose  is an irreducible tempered representation of O2n(F ) as in the proof of Hyp. 3.3.2 for orthogonal groups; in particular,   1 × · · · × q  0, with notations as therein. Then, the L-parameters are related as:  = 1 + · · · + 1 + 0 + v1 + · · · + vq (see Atobe­Gan [1, Desideratum 3.9]). In particular, for L-functions, evaluating at s = k  Z (see Sect. 5.2 for the fact that the point of evaluation is an integer), we get: L(k, ) = L(k, 1) · · · L(k, q) · L(k, 0) · L(k, 1v) · · · L(k, qv). Apply   Aut(C) to both sides while using Example 4.2.2 to get  (L(k, )) is
L(k,  1  a1-1) · · · L(k,  q  aq-1) ·  (L(k, 0)) · L(k,  1v  a1-1) · · · L(k,  qv  aq-1).
Now use (3.3.4) for  ; then take its L-function evaluated at s = k to get:
 (L(k, )) = L(k,  ),
assuming by induction that  (L(k, 0)) = L(k,  0) holds for a discrete series representation 0 of O2n0(F ). The proof for a discrete series representation follows the same reduction strategy as in the proof of Hyp. 3.3.2 for even orthogonal groups.

I expect that a proof of Hyp. 4.2.1 in the general case should come from an arithmeticanalysis of Shahidi's theory of local factors.

4.3. An arithmetic variant of Thm. 3.2.5 for normalised intertwining operator. We can now strengthen Thm. 3.3.7 for the normalised intertwining operator.
Theorem 4.3.1. Let the notations and hypotheses be as in Thm. 3.3.7. Assume furthermore that Hyp. 4.2.1 holds. Let Tnorm = Tnorm(s, )|s=k be the normalised standard intertwining operator (see (1.0.1)) at the point of evaluation s = k. Then there exists an E-linear Gequivariant map
Tnorm,E : aIndGP () - aIndGQ(  Q)
such that for any embedding  : E  C we have:
Tnorm,E E, 1C = Tnorm.

The adjoint action of LMP on LnP is the direct sum of two irreducible representations with representation spaces V1 = {ny,0  LnP } and V2 = {n0,X  LnP } of dimensions n and n(n - 1)/2, respectively; r1 is the standard representation and r2 is the exterior square representation; m = 2. The centre LAP of LMP consists of elements at = mt·In for t  C×; then at acts on V1 by the scalar t and on V2 by the scalar t2.

(5) The inducing data is a half-integrally unitary, irreducible, essentially-tempered, generic

representation  of GLn(F ); for the L-functions we have: (a) L(s, , r~1) = L(s, ), the standard L-function for GL(n), and (b) L(s, , r~2) = L(s, , 2), the exterior square L-function for GL(n).

5.4. Explicit intertwining calculation for the case of GL(2). Some essential features of main results are already visible for the example of GL(2) from first principles; although the reader is warned of the well-known dictum that GL(2) is misleadingly simple and it is difficult to carry out a straightforward generalisation of such calculations.

Let E/Q be a finite extension, and for i = 1, 2, let i : F ×  E× be a smooth character,

and i its restriction to OF×. Let  : the corresponding C-valued character

E of

 C be F ×. Let

an embedding of fields, and i =   i be G = GL2(F ), K = GL2(OF ), and for m  0

let K(m) be the principal congruence subgroup of K of level m; K(0) = K. The standard

intertwining operator Tst(s) at the point of evaluation s = -1 between the K(m)-invariants

of algebraically induced representations has the shape:

Tst(s)|s=-1 : aIndGB(1  2)K(m) - aIndGB(2(1)  1(-1))K(m).
The standing assumptions that i is half-integrally unitary, essentially tempered, and  = 1  2 is on the right of the unitary axis with respect to G implies that T := Tst(s)|s=-1 is finite. A function in aIndGB(1  2)K(m) is completely determined by its restriction to K. This gives us the following diagram:

aIndGB (1  2)K(m)

T / aIndGB(2(1)  1(-1))K(m)

f f |K
 aIndKKB(1  2)K(m)

f f |K

T

 / aIndKKB(2  1)K(m)

Working with K(m)-invariants is not strictly necessary; it has the virtue of making the spaces finite-dimensional and G-action is replaced by action of the Hecke-algebra Cc(G//K(m)). Let f   f~ denote the inverse of f  f |K. Let f  aIndGB(1  2)K(m) and for brevity let f  = f |K. Since T (f ) is determined by its restriction to K, we have:

T (f )(k) = T (f )(k) =

Since x-1  Pm, using the equivariance of f , the right hand side simplifies to:


1(x-1)2(x)f (k) dx.
r=m -rO×

Make the substitution x = -ru with u  O×; then dx = qrdu = qrd×u, and one gets:



f (k) 1(r)2(-r)qr

1(u-1)2(u) d×u.

r=m

The inner integral is nonzero if and only if 1(u) = 2(u) for all u  O×; assuming this to be the case we get:

x 1

k) dx =

vol(O×) · 1(m)2(-m)qm · 1 - 1()2(-1)q -1 · f (k).

For G = GL(2), the point of evaluation k = -1, and 1 - 1()2(-1)q -1 is nothing but L(s, 1  2, r~) = L(s, 1  -2 1) evaluated at this point of evaluation. Putting (5.4.1) and (5.4.2) together, one sees that T (f )(k) is a finite-sum:

1

a 1

k) +

(1, 2) · vol(O×) · 1(m)2(-m)qm · L(-1, 1  -2 1) · f (k).

For brevity, let I = aIndGB(1  2)K(m) and I~ = aIndGB(2(1)  1(-1))K(m); these induced representations admit a natural E-structures; define
I0 := aIndGB(1  2)K(m), I~0 := aIndGB(2(1)  1(-1))K(m).
If  : F ×  E× is a locally constant homomorphism then for any integer n we denote (n) =   | |n the E-valued character: u  (u) for all u  O× and   q-n(). It is clear then that I = I0 E, C and I~ = I~0 E, C. Note that I0 consists of all E-valued functions in I; similarly, I~0. The local L-value that appears in (5.4.3) is E-rational, i.e., L(-1, 1 -2 1) = 1 - 1()2(-1)q -1  (E), and furthermore, if L0(-1, 1 -2 1) = 1 - 1()2(-1)q -1  E then (L0(-1, 1  -2 1)) = L(-1, 1  -2 1). It is clear now from (5.4.3) that T (I0)  I~0; also that if T0 = T |I0 then T = T0 E, C.
