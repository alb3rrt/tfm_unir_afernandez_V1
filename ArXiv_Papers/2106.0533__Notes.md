## Abstract

To gain an advantage, quantum technologies utilize phenomena particular to quantum mechanics. Two such phenomena are squeezing and entanglement. Having generated states that exhibit these features, verification of their generation with local measurements can be a difficult process. Here we consider the states that are generated using the two-qudit single-axis squeezing Hamiltonian, that not only produces entangled two-qudit squeezed states but also results in various forms of interesting entangled states. We show how one can use local measurements to both efficiently verify and directly estimate the fidelity of these generated states.
