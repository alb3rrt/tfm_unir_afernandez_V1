Abstract
A family of Lempel-Ziv factorizations is a well-studied string structure. The LZ-End factorization is a member of the family that achieved faster extraction of any substrings (Kreft & Navarro, TCS 2013). One of the interests for LZ-End factorizations is the possible difference between the size of LZ-End and LZ77 factorizations. They also showed families of strings where the approximation ratio of the number of LZ-End phrases to the number of LZ77 phrases asymptotically approaches 2. However, the alphabet size of these strings is unbounded. In this paper, we analyze the LZ-End factorization of the period-doubling sequence. We also show that the approximation ratio for the period-doubling sequence asymptotically approaches 2 for the binary alphabet.
1 Introduction
The Lempel-Ziv 77 compression (LZ77 ) [33] is one of the most successful lossless compression algorithms to date. On the practical side, LZ77 and its variants have been used as a core of compression software such as zip, gzip, rar, and compressed formats such as PNG, JPEG, PDF. In addition to these real world applications, compressed self-indexing structures based on LZ77 have been proposed [24, 11, 12, 10]. An LZ77-based compressed representation of a string allowing for fast access, rank, and select queries also exists [2].
On the (more) theoretical side, the left-to-right greedy factorization in LZ77, a.k.a. the LZ77factorization, has widely been considered for decades. It parses a given input string w into a sequence p1, . . . , pz of non-empty substrings such that p1 = w[1] and pi for i  2 is the shortest prefix of pi · · · pz that does not occur in p1 · · · pi-1. This implies that the prefix pi[1..|pi|-1] occurs in p1 · · · pi-1, and such an occurrence is called a source of pi1.
Among many versions of LZ77 (c.f. [9, 34, 22, 21, 13, 29, 20]), this paper focuses on the LZ-End compressor proposed by Kreft and Navarro [21]. It is also based on a greedy parsing q1, . . . , qz of an input string, with a restriction that for each phrase qi there has to be a source which ends at the right-end of a phrase in q1, . . . , qi-1. This constraint permits fast substring extraction without expanding the whole input string. It is known that the LZ-End compression can be computed
1This version of LZ77 is often called non-overlapping LZ77 or LZ77 without self-references, since each phrase pi never overlaps with any of its sources.

in linear time in the input string length [17], or in compressed space with slight slow-down on compression time [16].
One can regard LZ-End as a mix of LZ77 and LZ78 [34], since in the LZ78 factorization the source of each phrase has to begin and end at boundaries of previous phrases. Since LZ78 belongs to the class of grammar compression [6], LZ-End can be seen as a new bridge between grammar compression and LZ77.
Now, a natural question arises. How good is the compression performance of LZ-End? Practical evaluation in the literature [21] has revealed that the compression ratio of LZ-End is quite close to that of LZ77 (at most 20% worse), but very little is understood in theory. As in the literature, we measure and compare the sizes of LZ-End and LZ77 by the numbers z and z of their phrases in the factorizations, i.e., "z versus z".
Since LZ77 is an optimal greedy unidirectional parsing, z  z always holds. Thus we are concerned with the approximation ratio of LZ-End to LZ77, which is defined by z /z. Kreft and Navarro [21] presented a simple family of strings for which z /z is asymptotically 2 over an alphabet of size n/3, where n is the length of the string. Kreft and Navarro [21] conjectured that the upper bound for z /z is also 2, but to our knowledge no non-trivial upper bond is known.
In this paper, we show that the same lower bound for z /z can be obtained on a binary alphabet, thus significantly reducing the number of distinct characters used in the analysis from n/3 to 2. In particular, we prove that z /z is asymptotically 2 for the period-doubling sequences, an interesting family of recursive strings. While the LZ77-factorization of the period-doubling sequences has an obvious structure (Proposition 10), the LZ-End factorization of the period-doubling sequences has a non-trivial structure and needs careful analysis (see our extensive discussions in Section 4 for detail).
Since the LZ77 factorization (without self-references) and the LZ-End factorization for the unary string an are the same, our result uses a minimum possible number of distinct characters to achieve such a lower bound for z /z.
Related work. A famous variant of the LZ77 factorization, which is called the C-factorization [9] and is denoted by w = c1 · · · cx, differs from the LZ77 in that each phrase ci is either a fresh character or the longest prefix of ci · · · cx that occurs in c1 · · · ci-1. The size x of the C-factorization is known to be a lower bound for the size of the smallest grammar which generates only the input string [30]. A comparison of the LZ77 factorization and the C-factorization was also considered in the literature [3, 26]. The structure of the C-factorization of the period-doubling sequences was investigated in [3]. We emphasize that our analysis of the LZ-End factorization of the perioddoubling sequences is independent and is quite different from this existing work [3].
Relative LZ (RLZ ) is a practical modification of LZ77 which efficiently compresses a collection of highly repetitive sequences [22]. In [20] an RLZ-based factorization of a string, called the ReLZ-factorization, was proposed. The approximation ratio of ReLZ to LZ77 was shown to be (log n) [20], where n denotes the length of the input string. On the other hand, in practice ReLZ was larger than LZ77 by at most a factor of two in all the tested cases in [20].
2 Preliminaries
2.1 Strings
Let  be the binary alphabet. An element of  is called a string. The length of a string w is denoted by |w|. The empty string  is the string of length 0. Let + be the set of non-empty strings, i.e., + =  \ {}. For a string w = xyz, x, y and z are called a prefix, substring, and suffix of w, respectively. They are called a proper prefix, a proper substring, and a proper suffix of w if x = w, y = w, and z = w, respectively. Further, we say that w has an internal occurrence of y if y is neither a prefix nor a suffix. The i-th character of a string w is denoted by w[i], where 1  i  |w|. For a string w and two integers 1  i  j  |w|, let w[i..j] denote the substring of w that begins at position i and ends at position j. For convenience, let w[i..j] =  when i > j.
2

For any 1  i  |w|, w[i..|w|] · w[1..i - 1] is called a cyclic rotation of w. If a cyclic rotation of w is not equal to w, the cyclic rotation is said to be proper. For any string w, let w1 = w and let wk = wwk-1 for any integer k  2, i.e., wk is the k-times repetition of w. A string w is said to be primitive if w cannot be written as xk for any x   and k  2. Let c be the opposite character of c  . For any non-empty binary string w, w denotes the string w[1..|w| - 1] · w[|w|]. We sometimes use b(x) and e(x) as the beginning position and the ending position of a substring x of a given string w, if the occurrence of x in w is clear from a discussion.
2.2 Lempel-Ziv factorizations
We introduce the Lempel-Ziv 77 and LZ-End factorizations. Definition 1 (LZ77 [33]2). The Lempel-Ziv 77 factorization (LZ77 factorization for short) of a string w is the factorization LZ77(w) = p1, . . . , pz of w such that pi[1..|pi| - 1] is the longest prefix of pi · · · pz which occurs in p1 · · · pi-1. As an exception, the last phrase pz can be a suffix of w which occurs in p1 · · · pz-1. Definition 2 (LZ-End [21]). The LZ-End factorization of a string w is the factorization LZend(w) = q1, . . . , qz of w such that qi[1..|qi| - 1] is the longest prefix of qi · · · qz which occurs as a suffix of q1 · · · qj for some j < i. As an exception, the last phrase qz can be a suffix of w which occurs as a suffix of q1 · · · qj for some j < z .
We refer to each pi and qi as an LZ phrase and LZ-End phrase, respectively. For each phrase, associated longest substring is called a source of the phrase. z77(w) and zend(w) denote the number of the LZ phrases and the LZ-End phrases of a string w, respectively. For each 1  i  zend(w), LZend(w)[i] denotes the i-th LZ-End phrase of LZend(w). Let LZend(w).last be the last LZ-End phrase of a string w, i.e., LZend(w).last = LZend(w)[zend(w)]. Fig. 1 shows examples of two factorizations.
LZ77(w) = a b a a a b a b a b a a a b a a a b a a a b a b a b a a a b a b
LZend(w) = a b a a a b a b a b a a a b a a a b a a a b a b a b a a a b a b
Figure 1: The upper one shows the LZ77 factorization of w and the lower one shows the LZ-End factorization of w, where w = abaaabababaaabaaabaaabababaaabab. This w is the fifth perioddoubling sequence S5 which will be defined later.
2.3 Period-doubling sequence
The period-doubling sequence (cf. [1]) is one of the prominent automatic sequences. Let Sk be the k-th period-doubling sequence for any k  0. The following two definitions are equivalent:
Definition 3. S0 = a and Sk = (Sk-1) for k  1 where  is the morphism such that (a) = ab, (b) = aa.
Definition 4. S0 = a and Sk = Sk-1 · Sk-1 for k  1. Let nk be the length of the k-th period-doubling sequence, i.e., nk = 2k.
3 Properties on period-doubling sequence
The period-doubling sequences have many good combinatorial properties (see cf. [1]). In this section, we introduce helpful properties for our results on the period-doubling sequences.
2This definition of LZ77 is different from the original one [33] (see [21] for more information).

Lemma 5. For any k  0, Sk is primitive. Proof. If Sk is not primitive, Sk has a period 2i for some i. This implies that Sk[nk/2] = Sk[nk], which contradicts Definition 4.
Lemma 6 (Proposition 8.1.5 of [25]). If a string w is primitive, ww has no internal occurrence of w.
Lemma 7. For any k  2, Sk = AkBkAkAk where Ak = Sk-2 and Bk = Ak. Moreover, Ak = Ak-1Bk-1 and Bk = Ak-1Ak-1 for any k  3.
Proof. Straightforward from Definition 3.
Lemma 8. For any k  2, AkAk, AkBk, and BkAk have no internal occurrence of Ak. Hence the number of occurrences of Ak in Sk = AkBkAkAk is 3.
Proof. If k = 2, the lemma clearly holds. We assume k  3. Since Ak = Sk-2, Ak is primitive. By Lemma 6, AkAk has no internal occurrence of Ak. Since AkBk = AkAk, AkBk also has no internal occurrence of Ak. Similarly, Ak-1Ak-1 and Ak-1Bk-1 have no internal occurrence of Ak-1. Also, by Lemma 7, BkAk can be written as Ak-1Ak-1Ak-1Bk-1. These imply that BkAk have no internal occurrence of Ak = Ak-1Bk-1.
Lemma 9. For any k  3 and any proper cyclic rotation  of Ak, the number of occurrences of  in AkAkAk, AkBk, and BkAk are 2, 1, and 0, respectively.
Proof. Since Ak is primitive,  is also primitive. Thus, AkAk has exactly one (internal) occurrences of . Namely,  occurs in AkAkAk exactly two times. Since AkBk = AkAk, AkBk also has exactly one (internal) occurrence of . Finally, let us consider BkAk = Ak-1Ak-1Ak-1Bk-1. In a similar way of the proof of Lemma 8, we can show that both Ak-1Ak-1 and Ak-1Bk-1 have no internal occurrence of Bk-1. From this facts and Lemma 8, Ak-1 occurs exactly three times and Bk-1 occurs exactly once in BkAk. If  = Bk-1Ak-1,  cannot occur in BkAk. Otherwise,  can be written as either xBk-1y or x Ak-1y where x (resp. y) is a non-empty suffix (resp. prefix) of Ak-1, and x (resp. y ) is a non-empty suffix (resp. prefix) of Bk-1. If  = xBk-1y,  cannot occur in BkAk due to the constraint of Bk-1. If  = x Ak-1y ,  cannot occur in BkAk due to the constraint of Ak-1 and the difference between the last characters of Ak-1 and x . Therefore  cannot occur in BkAk in all cases.
4 Factorizations of period-doubling sequence
By the definition of LZ77, the following proposition immediately holds:
Proposition 10. LZ77(Sk) = (S0, S0, S1, . . . , Sk-1) and thus z77(Sk) = k + 1.
In this section, we mainly discuss the LZ-End factorization of the period-doubling sequence, and give the following result. Theorem 11. zend(Sk) = 2k - f (k) where f (k) = O(log k).
By Proposition 10 and Theorem 11, we can reach our goal of this paper:
Corollary 12. There exists a family of binary strings w such that the ratio zend(w)/z77(w) asymptotically approaches 2.
In the rest of this paper, we show Theorem 11. The next lemma gives the LZ-End factorization of the period-doubling sequence.
Lemma 13. For any k  5, the following statements (I)-(IV) hold.
(I) LZend(Sk)[i] = LZend(Sk-1)[i] for every 1  i  zend(Sk-1) - 1.

(II) zend(Sk)  zend(Sk-1) + 1. Let

wk = LZend(Sk)[zend(Sk-1)], xk = LZend(Sk)[zend(Sk-1) + 1], yk = Sk[e(xk) + 1..nk] (possibly empty).

|wk| = 16 nk, |xk| = 16 nk + 1, |yk| = 16 nk - 1.

(IV) If |yk|  2, yk[1..|yk| - 1] has another occurrence to the left which ends with some LZ-End phrase of Sk. Namely, yk is the last LZ-End phrase of Sk if yk is not empty.

Proof. We prove this lemma by induction on k. Suppose that k = 5. The LZ-End factorizations of S4, S5 are

LZend(S4) = a|b|aa|aba|bab|aaabaa, LZend(S5) = a|b|aa|aba|bab|aaabaa|abaaabababa|aabab.

Statements (I) and (II) clearly hold. Then, w5 = aaabaa, x5 = abaaabababa, y5 = aabab. Hence,

statement (III) holds since n5 = 32 and w5 = LZend(S4).last (i.e., the latter case). Statement (IV) also holds since y5[1..4] = aaba has an occurrence which ends with the fourth phrase aba.

Suppose that all the statements hold for any k  [5, k - 1] for some k > 5. We show that all

the statements hold for k . Firstly, suppose on the contrary that statement (I) does not hold for

k . This implies that there exists a phrase T = Sk [b(LZend(Sk-1)[i])..j] for some i < zend(Sk -1)

and has

j > nk -1. an internal

is a substring of T , T By Lemma 8 (showing

the occurrences of Ak-1 in Sk-1), Ak -1 occurs exactly three times in Sk [1..nk -1]. The first

occurrence of Ak -1 cannot be included by a source of T since Ak -1 is not a prefix of T [1..|T | - 1].

In addition, the second occurrence of Ak -1 also cannot be included by a source of T since the

source overlaps phrase T . Thus, T [1..|T |-1] cannot have another occurrence to the left as a source

of T . This contradicts that T is an LZ-End phrase of Sk at that position. Hence, statement (I)

holds for k . Due to statement (I), wk must have yk -1 as a prefix. On the other hand, wk cannot

reach the end of Sk . Hence, statement (II) also holds. Thanks to statements (I) and (II) for k ,

three substrings wk , xk , and yk are well-defined (see Fig. 2 and 5 for illustrations). Next, we show statements (III) and (IV).

· Assume that (k - 1) = (k ) (i.e., wk = LZend(Sk -1).last). We consider a phrase wk . If

|yk -1| = 0, xk -1

is the suffix of

length

3 8

nk

-1

of Sk -1, i.e., xk -1

= Bk -2Ak -1.

From

Lemma 8, xk -1 does not have other occurrences to the left. This implies that wk = xk -1.

This contradicts to wk = LZend(Sk -1).last. Thus, |yk -1| > 0 holds. Namely, xk -1 =

LZend(Sk -1)[zend(Sk -1) - 1] and yk -1 = LZend(Sk -1).last (see also Fig. 2). Let W be the

string

of

length

1 8

nk

which begins at b(LZend(Sk -1).last).

(k - 1) = (k ) also implies

that

(k - 1) < k .

Hence,

|yk -1|

(k

This fact means that

W is a proper cyclic rotation of Ak -1. By Lemma 9, W occurs twice to the left (one is

in Ak -1Bk -1, the other is in Ak -1Ak -1). Since the second occurrence ends with phrase

LZend(Sk )[zend(Sk -1) - 1], W cW is a candidate of phrase wk where cW is the character

preceded by W . Assume on the contrary that a source of phrase wk is W u for some u  + (see Fig. 3). The second occurrence of W cannot be the beginning position of a

source of wk since W u overlaps wk . Hence, the only candidate of the beginning position of source W u is in the first Ak -1Bk -1. Moreover, W u cannot contain Bk -1 since the

original W u occurs in Ak -1Ak -1 · · · . Thus, W u is a proper substring of Ak -1Ak -1 and

Ak -1Bk -1. In other words, u W u is a proper prefix of Ak -1Ak -1 and Ak -1Bk -1 for some u . Since xk -1 is a proper substring of Ak -1Ak -1, xk -1 also occurs in u W u. Hence,

this contradicts that phrase xk -1 ends with W (i.e., xk -1 has to be a longer phrase.), and

then, wk = W cW . Next, we consider a phrase xk . By the definition of the period-doubling

sequence, there exists a clear candidate X of a source which ends at e(xk -1) (see Fig. 4).

Then, an equation |yk -1| + Sk [b(yk -1)..nk ]. Thus, |X|

|wk -1

length of suffix implies that X

has Bk -1Ak -1 as a substring. There does not exist a longer candidate since Bk -1Ak -1

has only one occurrence to the left. Hence, xk = XcX where cX is the character preceded

by X. Finally, we consider the suffix yk of Sk . If |yk |  2, from the above discussion,

yk -1[2..|yk -1| - 1] = yk [1..|yk | - 1] holds. Since yk -1[2..|yk -1| - 1] has an occurrence

to the left which ends with some phrase ( statement (IV) for k - 1), yk [1..|yk | - 1] too. Therefore, statements (III) and (IV) also hold.

· Assume that (k - 1) = (k ) (i.e., wk = LZend(Sk -1).last). We can show that all the statements also hold for this case in a similar way. If we assume |yk -1| > 0, then |wk | > |yk -1| holds by the above discussions. This contradicts that wk = LZend(Sk -1).last, and

a source of wk can be also a source of yk . Namely, yk is the last phrase. Thus, all the

statements also hold for this case.

Therefore, this lemma holds.

We have just finished showing the form of the LZ-End factorization of Sk. Now, we will analyze
the number of phrases of the factorization. Let K be the sequence of integers k which satisfies (k) = k. Let km denotes the m-th smallest integer in K. Each km can be represented by the following recurrence formula:

zend(Sk) = 2k - f (k),

where f (k) is a function such that f (k) = m + 1 if k  [km - 1, km +1 - 2].

7

Proof. By Lemma 13, if |yk| = 0 (i.e., k + 1  K), then zend(Sk) = zend(Sk-1) + 1 holds, otherwise, zend(Sk) = zend(Sk-1) + 2 holds. Hence, for any k  [km - 1, km +1 - 2],
zend(Sk) = zend(S5) + 2(k - 5) - (m - 1) = 2k - (m + 1) = 2k - f (k).

Lemma 16. f (k) = O(log k).

Proof. By Lemma 14,

km

=

O(2km  -1 )

Thus, m = O(log k) holds. This implies that f (k) = O(log k) by Lemma 15. By Lemmas 15 and 16, Theorem 11 holds.

5 Conclusions and further work
Let z and z be the number of phrases in the LZ-End and LZ77 factorizations in a string. In this paper, we proved that the approximation ratio z /z of LZ-End to LZ77 is asymptotically 2 for the period-doubling sequences. This significantly reduces the number of distinct characters needed to achieve such a lower bound from n/3 (in the existing work [21]) to 2 (in this work). We believe that our work initiates analysis of theoretical performance of LZ-End compression.
A lot of interesting further work remains for LZ-End, including the following:
· Is our lower bound for the approximation ratio tight? Kreft and Navarro [21] conjectured that z /z  2 holds for any string. We performed some exhaustive experiments on binary strings and the result supports their conjecture.
· Is the size z of the LZ-End factorization is a lower bound for the size g of the smallest grammar generating the input string? It is known that the size of the C-factorization [9], a variant of LZ77, is a lower bound of g [30, 6]. In particular case of the period-doubling sequences, there exists the following small SLP (i.e. grammar in the Chomsky normal form) generating the k-th period-doubling sequence: Sk = Sk-1Tk, Tk = Sk-2Sk-2, . . . , S1 = ab, S0 = a. Following [30], the size of an SLP is evaluated by the number of productions and thus the above grammar is of size 2k + 1. It is quite close to the size of the LZ-End factorization which is 2k - O(log k) but is slightly larger.
· Interesting relationships between the size of the C-factorization and other string repetitive measures such as the size r of the run-length BWT [5], the size s of the smallest run-length SLP [28], the size of the Lyndon factorization [7], the size b of the smallest bidirectional scheme [31], the size  of the smallest string attractor [18], the substring complexity  [8], have been considered in the literature [4, 19, 23, 32, 14, 27, 15]. Can we extend these results to the LZ-End?
