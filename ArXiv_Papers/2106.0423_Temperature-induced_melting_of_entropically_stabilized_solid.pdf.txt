Do solids stabilized by entropy melt with increasing temperature? In order to address this puzzle we use computer simulations to study entropy-driven solidification and melting in binary mixtures of big and small particles interacting via a repulsive potential. At low temperatures and sufficiently large area fractions, big particles form solid clusters stabilized by the osmotic pressure of the surrounding fluid of small particles. At higher temperatures the solid gradually melts and a homogeneous phase of big and small particles results. We show that increasing temperature enhances the interpenetration and reduces the effective radii of big particles. We argue that the resulting change of balance of free volume and mixing contributions to the entropy is responsible for the melting of the big particle solid. The implications of our results for experiments on asymmetric colloidal mixtures are discussed.

In most many-body systems ordering is produced by attractive forces and is destroyed by entropy. An exception to this rule are systems with entropy-driven ordering characterized by an ordered phase with higher entropy than that of the disordered phase [1­3]. One example is a one-component system of hard spheres which crystallize at sufficiently high concentration because they have more free volume and thus higher entropy in the ordered crystal rather than in the disordered fluid [4]. Another example are lyotropic liquid crystals [5] in which nematic ordering arises as the result of interplay between rotational and translational degrees of freedom of elongated rigid molecules as the system gives up orientational entropy in order to gain translational entropy. Yet another example is a simple lattice model of a binary hard sphere mixture [6] which shows entropy-driven demixing transition. Likewise, binary mixtures of colloidal particles of different sizes that interact by purely repulsive forces [7­19] exhibit a demixing transition in which the big particles form an ordered solid surrounded by small particle fluid. The common understanding of this phenomenon is in terms of the entropic depletion mechanism proposed by Asakura and Oosawa [20, 21]: when the number of small particles is much larger than that of big ones, the system can decrease its free energy by creating a dense ordered phase of big particles thus freeing additional volume in which small particles can move and therefore increasing the entropy of the latter. This entropy increase gives rise to osmotic pressure applied by the small particle fluid on the big particle solid at the interface between them, that overcomes the repulsive forces between the big particles and stabilizes the solid. Note that this mechanism does not violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics since the decrease of entropy of big particles is overcompensated by the increase of entropy of the small ones.
While this phenomenon is well understood, it raises an interesting issue that has not been addressed so far: what

happens to big particle crystals as temperature is increased? Clearly, for hard spheres there is no energy scale (the force between two particles changes abruptly from zero to infinity as they approach each other) and the phase behavior of the mixture is determined by the interplay between the entropies of small particles and of big ones. Since these entropic contributions to the free energy increase linearly with temperature, the phase diagram of the hard sphere system depends only on the concentrations of the two components and not on temperature. However, when the repulsive interaction between the particles is described by a continuous potential (such that the repulsive force is always finite), the distance of closest approach depends on temperature and the question about the thermal stability of big particle solids formed by depletion forces remains open. The study of this problem is the subject of the present work which, for simplicity, is carried out in two dimensions.
To elucidate the temperature-dependent behavior of a binary mixture of soft big and small particles, we carry out Langevin dynamics simulations using LAMMPS (Largescale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator). Our 2d system contains Nb big and Ns small particles, with a large ratio of Lennard-Jones diameters b = 10s (in the following we take s = 1). The simulation box is a square of length L = 447.6s with periodic boundary conditions. The corresponding area fractions are i = Ni(i/2)2/L2 with i = b, s (for example, for s = 0.343 and b = 0.245, Ns = 87500 and Nb = 625). For simplicity we took the masses of big and small particles to be the same, mb = ms = 1 (we verified that this choice does not affect the statistical properties of our results, such as the total energy and the steady-state configurations of the system - not shown). Following Stokes' law we took the friction coefficients to be proportional to the radii of the particles, b = 10s and since damp = m/, we set the damping times (which deter-

mine the characteristic transition time from ballistic to
diffusive motion due to collisions with molecules of the
implicit solvent) to b = 5LJ and s = 50LJ (in the following we take the Lennard-Jones interaction parameter and time to be = 1 and LJ = (mss2/ )1/2 = 1, respectively).
Particles i and j interact with each other via a soft repul-
sive WCA (Weeks-Chandler-Andersen) potential given by Uij (r) = 4 ij [(ij /r)12 - (ij /r)6] + ij with ij = 1, cut-off distance of 1.12ij and additive sum-rule: ij = (i + j)/2. The motion of the particles in the system is described by the Langevin equation

where U is the total potential energy (sum over all Uij), i is the i-th particle friction coefficient and i is a random thermal force with magnitude proportional to (ikBT /t)1/2, where kB, T and t are the Boltzmann constant, temperature and integration time step, respectively (we take kB = 1 and measure the temperature and time in reduced LJ units). We began each simulation from a well-mixed configuration of the two components obtained by setting T = 1, low big-small repulsion strength bs = 0.1, and high bigbig and small-small repulsion strengths bb = ss = 2.0; this choice of parameters promotes rapid mixing. After a well-mixed state was reached, we set the temperature to the required value T and changed all the interaction parameters to ij = 1. In each simulation, we waited until a steady state was reached in the sense that no further evolution of the big particle clusters and of the nearest-neighbor distribution of big particles, was observed. We scanned the three-dimensional parameter space {s, b, T } in a broad range of area fractions s : [0.2, 0.6], b : [0.1, 0.5] and temperatures T : [0.1, 20]. For sufficiently large total (small + big) area fractions and Ns Nb, big particles formed large solid clusters with high degree of hexatic ordering at lower temperatures T  1. As temperature was increased these clusters underwent partial melting and solid-gas coexistence of big particles surrounded by small particle fluid, was observed (see Fig. S1 in Supplementary Material). At high area fractions of big particles and low temperatures, a percolated solid network of big particles was formed (similar structures were also reported in other studies [22]), presumably because further coarsening by big particle exchange was kinetically suppressed at low temperatures where nearly no mobile isolated big particles were present. In order to explore the temperature-induced melting of solid clusters, we focused our attention on a mixture with area fractions b = 0.245 and s = 0.343. Snapshots of the system in steady state (though not necessarily at thermodynamic equilibrium) at four different

temperatures are shown in Fig.1. The relaxation time to reach a steady state in which no further reorganization is observed decreases with increasing temperature and is of order 500, 000LJ at T = 1, 300, 000LJ at T = 5, 200, 000LJ at T = 9, and 5, 000LJ at T = 15, in agreement with the expectation that as the fraction of highly mobile big particles in the gas phase increases (see Fig.1), the kinetics of reorganization becomes faster. Note that the relaxation of the total energy is much faster (of order 200LJ at all temperatures, see Fig.S2 in SM) than the relaxation to steady state, which indicates that the big particle organization is driven by entropy and not by energy.

The visual information contained in the snapshots in Fig. 1 is further quantified by the corresponding histograms of the nearest-neighbor (NN) distributions of big particles at different temperatures (Fig.2). Thus, at T = 1 there is a large branched cluster that contains most of the big particles in the system (Fig.1). Inspection of the corresponding histogram in Fig.2 shows that there are many particles with 3 - 6 NN (bulk and surface particles of the cluster) and almost no particles in the gas phase (with 0 - 2 NN). At T = 5 and T = 9, solid clusters become more compact and while the 6 NN peak remains (and even increases in height at T = 5 compared to T = 1), the distribution broadens and shifts to smaller numbers of NN (the contribution of particles with 0 - 2 NN increases at the expense of particles with 3 - 5 NN), as melting proceeds and larger numbers of particles move to the gas phase. Finally, at T = 15, the large cluster disintegrates into a gas phase consisting of isolated particles

3
and small clusters of < 20 particles. The corresponding histogram shows a peak around 1 - 2 NN characteristic of small clusters with 2 - 4 particles and a significant contribution from isolated particles with 0 NN.

What is the physical origin of temperature-induced melting observed in Fig.1? Since such effects are not expected in mixtures of hard spheres, they are obviously related to the smooth nature of the repulsive interactions in our system (the interparticle force remains finite at all separations) and to the fact that as temperature increases there is enhanced interpenetration between the particles. Indeed, we observed that the mean distance between big particles in a cluster decreases and the repulsive force between them increases with increasing temperature (not shown). In order to quantify this effect, in Fig.3 we plotted the radial distribution function of big particles gbb(r) at different temperatures. Since the average separation between neighboring particles in big particle clusters is given by the position of the first peak of the radial distribution function, we defined the temperature-dependent effective radius of a big particle, rbeff (T ), as half of this distance and plotted it as a function of T in the inset of Fig.3. The error bars for the radii were estimated by the width of each peak and averaging over results of more initial conditions. While this definition strictly applies to big particles in clusters, similar values of rbeff were obtained by examining the interpenetration of big particles by small ones (not shown). As expected, this effective radius decreases monotonically with increasing temperature. In order to understand how increased interpenetration of big particles at higher temperatures gives rise to melting let us recall why big particles segregate from small ones and solidify in the first place. In hard core systems the effect arises because of the competition between two types of entropies. The first is the entropy of mixing Smix

that favors a homogeneous well-mixed state in which big and small particles are uniformly distributed throughout the system. In systems where the sizes of the two particles are similar, entropy of mixing always dominates and phase separation does not take place. However, if both the size ratio of big and small particles and their total concentration are sufficiently large, and in addition the number of small particles is much larger than that of big ones, another kind of entropy which we will call the free volume entropy Sfv, becomes important. This entropy results from the fact that by separating and condensing the big particles one increases the available volume for small particles and since Ns Nb, the resulting increase of the entropy of small particles overwhelms the decrease of the entropy of big ones (due to their solidification) and therefore increases the total entropy of the system. Under these conditions the free volume entropy can overcome the entropy of mixing and induce phase separation and solidification of big particles. The free volume entropy gives rise to depletion forces applied by the small particles on the big ones that can be represented as effective attractions between the latter, by integrating out the degrees of freedom of the small particles in the partition function of the system and calculating the effective interaction potential between the big particles [8]. Such systematic calculation of the depletion forces predicts phase separation between big and small particles [8] but, since it is based on the superposition approximation that neglects many body correlations, it cannot be used to compute the effective forces that hold together the big particle solid. In view of the above, we will limit ourselves to a qualitative discussion of temperature-induced melting of big particle solids observed in our simulation.
A critically important observation is that a big particle solid forms only when both (a) the total concentration and (b) the concentration of small particles are sufficiently high. A tentative explanation is that con-

4

dition (a) ensures that the concentration of vacancies v = 1-s -b is small and therefore the entropy of mixing contribution is small (recall that in a mean field lattice theory, there is a v ln v contribution to the entropy of mixing [23]). Condition (b) is related to the expectation that since osmotic pressure applied by small particles on big particle clusters is a monotonically increasing function of their concentration, the depletion forces that stabilize the big particle solid should increase with the area fraction of small particles. Note that the relevant area fraction is not the nominal one s but rather the effective area fraction of small particles in the space that is not occupied by the big particles, esff = s/ (1 - b) (strictly speaking, this relation is valid in the limit s/b = 0 - see ref. [8]). Coming back to consideration of temperature effects on the stability of solid clusters of big particles we substitute the temperature-dependent effective radius of a big particle (see inset to Fig.3) into the expression for the area fraction of big particles. This yields

The effective concentration of vacancies is given by

where we used the nominal area fraction of small particles s since the first peak of the radial distribution function gss(r) is always located at r > s (see Fig. S3 in SM), interpenetration of small particles is negligible and s(T ) = 1 for all T .
The three effective area fractions are plotted as a function of temperature in Fig.4. We believe that the observed decrease of esff and increase of evff are correlated with lowering of free volume entropy (smaller depletion forces) and enhancement of entropy of mixing, with increasing temperature. The change of balance between the two contributions to the entropy of the system is responsible for the temperature-induced melting of big particle solid observed in our simulations.

In this work we used computer simulations in 2d to study the effects of temperature on formation and melting of solid clusters of big particles in highly asymmetric binary mixtures of small and big particles interacting through repulsive forces. We observed the formation of stable solid clusters of big particles at low temperatures, followed by gradual melting of these clusters as temperature was increased. Since at present there is no analytic theory that captures these phenomena we proposed a tentative physical mechanism based on competition between free volume and mixing contributions to entropy, in which Sfv gives rise to depletion forces that stabilize the big particle solid at low temperatures and Smix that favors mixing. We show that the parameters that determine these entropic contributions (the effective area fractions of big and small particles and of vacancies) are temperature-dependent due to enhanced interpenetration of big particles and therefore the reduction of their size at elevated temperatures. This, in turn, increases the free volume available to the small particles and decreases the depletion force of the solid clusters of big particles; it also increases the entropy of mixing in our three component (big and small particles and vacancies) system. The combination of both effects leads to the observed melting of solid clusters at high temperatures.
We would like to mention some of the limitations of the present study. The present simulation was done in 2d and most of the reported results refer to a system of 87500 small and 625 big particles. The system size was chosen to allow us to scan a broad range of parameters (area fractions) and achieve steady state at different tempera-

5

tures. Based on our results on smaller systems (see e.g., Fig. S1 in SM) we believe that finite size effects would not affect our qualitative results (we also believe that similar phenomena will be observed in 3d). Another limitation that may affect the applicability of our results to colloidal mixtures is the use of implicit solvent and therefore the neglect of hydrodynamic interactions between our particles (note however, that assumption should affect the kinetics but not the equilibrium properties). Finally, we would like to comment on possible experimental tests of our results. Different repulsive potentials between particles could be realized in the lab, e.g., by using colloids of different sizes, stabilized by grafted polymers or by electric charges. While our WCA interaction potential would have to be modified to describe such systems, softer repulsive forces are expected to lead to increased interpenetration and to enhancement of temperature effects on melting. We believe that our findings are also relevant to phase separation in living cells in which high concentrations of soluble proteins and other biomolecules give rise to strong depletion interactions [15, 24].

Temperature-induced Melting of Entropically Stabilized Solid - Supplemental Material
(Dated: June 2, 2021)

FIG. S1: Snapshots of relaxed systems with s = 0.3 and b in the range [0.3,0.5]. Upper row: The three systems at T = 1. Lower row: The same systems at temperatures roughly corresponding to the onset of melting (T = 4 for b = 0.3, T = 8 for b = 0.4 and T = 20 for b = 0.5)

Additional snapshots (Fig. S1) of relaxed binary mixtures in a smaller simulation box of length L = 200s with s = 0.3. At T=1, as b is increased (at fixed s and therefore decreasing concentration of vacancies v), the big particle solid gradually changes from a compact cluster to a percolating network that spans the entire simulation box (see upper row in Fig. S1). The onset of melting is shifted to higher temperatures with increasing b (see lower row in Fig. S1).
Potential energy curves as a function of time are shown in Fig. S2(a) for s = 0.343, b = 0.245, L = 447.6. The relaxation time of the energy is of order of the viscous damping time (50LJ for small particles). Since the energy is constant after this relaxation, further reorganization of big particles observed in Fig. S2(b) is entropydriven.
Small-small radial distribution function gss as a function of r (in units of s) at temperatures T = 1, 5, 9 and 15, for s = 0.343, b = 0.245, L = 447.6. Even though the first peak is lower at higher temperatures, in all temperatures checked, it is above s.
