Abstract
The search for a geometrical understanding of dualities in string theory, in particular T-duality, has led to the development of modern T-duality covariant frameworks such as Double Field Theory, whose mathematical structure can be understood in terms of generalized geometry and, more recently, para-Hermitian geometry. In this work we apply techniques associated to this doubled geometry to four-dimensional manifolds, and we show that they are particularly well-suited to the analysis of integrability in special spacetimes, especially in connection with Penrose's twistor theory and its applications to general relativity. This shows a close relationship between some of the geometrical structures in the para-Hermitian approach to double field theory and those in algebraically special solutions to the Einstein equations. Particular results include the classification of four-dimensional, possibly complex-valued, (para-)Hermitian structures in different signatures, the Lie and Courant algebroid structures of special spacetimes, and the analysis of deformations of (para-)complex structures. We also discuss a notion of "weighted algebroids" in relation to a natural gauge freedom in the framework. Finally, we analyse the connection with two- and three-dimensional (real and complex) twistor spaces, and how the former can be understood in terms of the latter, in particular in terms of twistor families.

1 Introduction
Generalized geometry [1, 2] is a branch of differential geometry that unifies symplectic and complex geometry and in which, in particular, vector fields and 1-forms on a manifold M are treated on an equal footing, as sections of a "doubled" or generalized tangent bundle, TM = T M  T M. The generalization to TM of the differential structure encoded in the Lie bracket is captured by the notion of Courant algebroids, which involve the socalled Dorfman bracket (or its antisymmetric version, the Courant bracket). During the last years these structures have appeared naturally in theoretical high-energy physics, as a central tool for the understanding of the geometry of string theory, related in particular to the geometrical interpretation of T-duality (e.g. [3]). A prominent line of developments in this respect is Double Field Theory (see below), where it has recently been shown [4, 5, 6, 7] that also para-Hermitian geometry is particularly well-suited to the understanding of its mathematical structure. In this work we show that doubled geometry is also natural in general relativity, where it provides a new perspective on `integrability issues' in special spacetimes and their connection with twistor theory.
As an initial motivation, let us give a rough argument to introduce para-Hermitian and generalized geometry in string theory, and their connections with T-duality. When considering string toroidal compactifications, a distinctive feature of strings is that their

2

extended nature allows them to wrap non-contractible cycles around the compact dimensions. As a consequence, strings are not only characterized by momentum modes but also by winding modes, which describe how the strings wind around the tori. Roughly speaking, T-duality is a symmetry of string theory that establishes that momentum and winding states should be considered on an equal footing. As a simple example, suppose we have only one compact dimension, a circle S1 with radius R. The momentum and winding modes are quantized; they are characterized by two quantum numbers n, m. From the mass spectrum for closed strings one can see (as a standard reference cf. [8, Section 8.3]) that, when R  , winding modes become very heavy, while momentum modes become light and start to form a continuum, as corresponds to a non-compact dimension. Similarly, when R  0, momentum modes become infinitely massive but winding modes become light, and the spectrum again approaches a continuum. Therefore, the R   and R  0 limits appear to be physically equivalent, a remarkable feature that is exclusive to string theory since a field theory of point-like particles has no winding states (so no spacetime dimension `opens up' when R  0 in that case). This equivalence comes from the fact that the string spectrum is invariant under the simultaneous change R  /R, n  m (where  is the inverse of the string tension), a symmetry which extends to any observable in the theory. This is the simplest manifestation of T-duality; more generally, T-duality relates the physics of strings propagating on backgrounds with very different geometries.
Since momentum modes are conjugate or `dual' to spacetime coordinates xi, the consideration of momentum and winding modes at the same level suggests the introduction of a new set of coordinates x~i `dual' to winding. This doubling of coordinates allows to formulate a field theory that incorporates the degrees of freedom associated to winding without necessarily representing strings, and such that T-duality is a manifest symmetry of the theory. This scheme is called Double Field Theory (DFT) since the pioneering work [9] (see also e.g. [10] for a review), and represents a T-duality covariant formulation of supergravity that incorporates stringy aspects not present in the usual treatment of supergravity. Although the doubling of space coordinates should only affect the compact dimensions, it is useful in practice to duplicate all space coordinates; in this way one ends up with a doubled space, which in the simplest case is a product T × T~ and has global coordinates (xi, x~i), where T and T~ are d-dimensional flat tori that are said to be dual from each other. This `extended spacetime' is intended to be the target space of the fundamental string, and the physical fields1 are organized in representations of the T-duality group O(d, d). Furthermore, from the field content of the theory one deduces a notion of generalized diffeomorphisms, that are infinitesimally generated by a generalized Lie derivative or `D-bracket'. Consistency conditions (i.e. closure of the algebra of generalized diffeomorphisms) impose a restriction on the fields. A particular solution to this restriction is the so-called `section condition' or `strong constraint', where the fields are forced to depend on only half of the doubled coordinates. This half is determined as a subspace that is maximally isotropic (or totally null) with respect to the O(d, d) metric
1In the simplest formulation of DFT, the physical fields correspond to the massless sector of closed strings, namely a metric tensor, a 2-form field (the Kalb-Ramond field) and a scalar field (the dilaton).

T-duality acts by transforming any such isotropic subspace into another.
One might already anticipate some parallelism of the DFT framework with generalized geometry, in the sense that both formalisms are based on a doubled space. However, an important difference is that in the former, what is doubled is the base manifold, while in the latter is the tangent bundle. This difference is important if one wants to understand T-duality in the generalized geometry setting, since, as argued above, the very essence of T-duality is to exchange the manifolds T and T~. Upon restriction to fields satisfying the strong constraint, the D-bracket reduces to the Dorfman bracket and one can argue that the DFT setting reduces locally to generalized geometry (see e.g. [12]). A possible formalization of all this (that is also intended to provide a global formulation of DFT) originates in the work of Vaisman in [4, 5], who shows, in the first place, that the usual extended spacetime of DFT is a flat para-Kähler manifold. To see this, consider first an almost para-Hermitian structure on a 2d-dimensional manifold M: a pair (, K) where K  End(T M) and  is a metric such that

K2 = I, (KX, KY ) = -(X, Y )

(1.2)

for any vector fields X, Y . The map K is called almost para-complex structure, and it produces a splitting of the tangent bundle as T M = L  L~, where L, L~ are the (±1)eigenbundles of K. These eigenbundles are maximally isotropic with respect to , i.e. they are d-dimensional and satisfy (1.1), and this implies that L~ = L (see Section 2 for details). If L and L~ are involutive under the Lie bracket then K is said to be integrable, and there exist local coordinates (xi, x~i), i = 1, ..., d, such that, denoting i = /xi and ~i = /x~i, one has L = span(i) and L~ = span(~i). If  is flat, then it can be expressed in these coordinates as  = dxi  dx~i. So there are two complementary foliations F, F~ such that L = T F and L~ = T F~ 3, and L~ = L implies that T F~ = T F , thus T M has actually the structure of a generalized tangent bundle: T M = T F  T F . Furthermore, Vaisman shows [4] that there is a natural notion of D-bracket on T M, and that it reduces to the Dorfman bracket for fields with dependence only on F , so in this way one recovers generalized geometry. Finally, different T-dual spacetimes correspond to different choices of para-complex structures.
The study of DFT from the perspective of para-Hermitian geometry, in settings more general than the flat para-Kähler case, was further developed in [5] and [6, 7, 13, 14], and also in several subsequent works, being currently an active research area. (Early considerations of the relationship between para-Hermitian structures and T-duality can be found in [15].) A particularly important difference between Hermitian and para-Hermitian geometry is that the eigenbundles of an almost-complex structure are complex conjugates of each other, while those of an almost para-complex structure are independent. As a
2The metric  involved in (1.1) does not represent the gravitational field; it is part of the `kinematics' of the theory. The gravitational field is unified with the 2-form field into a `generalized metric', which codifies the dynamics; this will not play a role in the present work.
3This notation means that if  is a leaf in F , then T  = L|, etc.

consequence, the integrability properties of a para-Hermitian structure can be split into separate questions about the involutivity of each eigenbundle, so one can talk about "halfintegrability". We will see that this is especially important in general relativity and its connection with twistor structures.
A key condition in the analysis above is equation (1.2), which implies (1.1) for the eigenbundles of K. For real K, this means that the signature of  must be (d, d); so in four dimensions this is (+ + --), which is different from the usual Lorentz signature (+ ---) of general relativity. However, if we allow K to be a map on the complexified tangent bundle, then the metric is allowed to have any signature (or to be complex). Our interest in complex-valued maps arises from the power of using complex methods in relativity, which date back to remarkable programmes such as Penrose's twistor theory, Newman's H-space, and Plebaski's hyper-heavenly (HH) construction. (One can argue that, in a sense, all these constructions can be understood as parts of the twistor programme.) This is one of our main motivations in this work: submanifolds where the condition (1.1) holds are actually the basic object of twistor theory, but they arise from a completely different perspective, namely the essential premise of the twistor programme that light-rays are more fundamental than spacetime points. A related motivation comes from the fact that a "complex-valued almost-complex structure" has some significance in developments in mathematical relativity and their relation to twistor structures, see [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. As in ordinary para-Hermitian geometry, the phenomenon of "half-integrability" is shared by such complex-valued maps. The present work can be regarded as the application of some of the modern DFT-like techniques mentioned above to 4-manifolds, with the extra ingredient that K can be complex-valued so that one can make contact with general relativity and twistor theory.
Main results
The fact that we consider complex-valued "para-Hermitian" structures implies that, unlike the usual literature in DFT and related matters, we can analyse different signatures of the metric, by imposing different reality conditions. Since we work in a 4-manifold M (which we assume to be orientable), this means that we will deal with Lorentz, Riemannian (or Euclidean) and split (or neutral) signature. The Lorentzian case is relevant, of course, for general relativity (and in particular for the so-called hyper-heavenly spaces [21]); the Riemannian case is relevant because e.g. of the Atiyah-Hitchin-Singer approach to twistor theory [22]; and the split case can be related, since the work of Ooguri and Vafa [23], to the geometry of strings with N = 2 supersymmetry. (It is also related to the LeBrun-Mason twistor construction in split signature [24].)
Since an arbitrary 4-manifold with a metric does not naturally come equipped with a (possibly complex-valued) almost para-Hermitian structure, we first focus on classifying all possible such structures. We show that regardless of signature, an almost para-Hermitian structure is essentially equivalent to an (anti-)self-dual 2-form (in the sense of Hodge duality). Then we use this result to describe the space Px of para-Hermitian structures at any point x  M: we show that Px has two connected components and, imposing appropriate reality conditions whenever possible, each component can be described as:
5

a complex projective line CP1 in Riemannian signature4, the space (RP1 × RP1)\RP1 in split signature, and the space (CP1 × CP1)\CP1 in Lorentz signature (and in complex 4manifolds). We show that, topologically, these spaces are respectively a real 2-sphere S2, a hyperboloid of one sheet H1, and a complex 2-sphere CS2. For Hermitian structures, the corresponding spaces are CP1, CP1\RP1 (a hyperboloid of two sheets) and (CP1 × CP1)\CP1, respectively. We also find that there is a natural "gauge freedom" associated to the representation of a (para-)Hermitian structure, and we develop a correspondingly covariant formalism.
We then analyse the integrability conditions for almost (para-)Hermitian structures, and we show that involutivity of one of the eigenbundles of K (or "half-integrability") is equivalent to the existence of certain special spinors, that in relativity language give origin to what are called shear-free null geodesic congruences. This allows us to show that there are natural algebroid structures associated to any four-dimensional manifold with a shear-free congruence, namely Lie and Courant algebroids. This gives explicit examples of Courant algebroids in four dimensions, that include e.g. all algebraically special Einstein manifolds (such as the Kerr and Schwarzschild black hole solutions, but also all vacuum Petrov type II solutions), so it connects the structures studied in generalized geometry to spacetimes of interest in classical relativity. Furthermore, the Lie algebroid structure has naturally associated a cochain complex that can be used to prove the existence of potentials in problems of interest in relativity. We are naturally led to the question of generalizing the algebroid structure to fields with general transformation properties under the gauge freedom mentioned above, and we discuss the possible construction of such an object ("weighted algebroid") and the associated differential complex.
Finally, we focus on connections with twistor theory, showing that: any particular halfintegrable para-Hermitian structure defines a 2-dimensional (2D) twistor space, and if all para-Hermitian structures are half-integrable, then there is a 3-dimensional (3D) twistor space, which is a one-parameter family of 2D twistor spaces parametrized by projective spinor fields. This 3D space is the total space of a fibration of 2D twistor spaces over projective spinors if and only if the vacuum Einstein equations are satisfied. We also discuss the relationships with other twistor constructions in the literature. Finally we define deformations of para-complex structures in M and analyse their integrability, and we show that small, half-integrable deformations exist if and only if the Weyl tensor is half-algebraically special, and in this case they define sections of a line bundle over a 2D twistor space. As in the rest of the paper, our results here are valid for any metric signature.
Conventions and overview
Our conventions for different kinds of indices, curvature, etc. follow Penrose and Rindler [25, 26]. The organization of this work is as follows. We start in Section 2 with some background material: we review basic notions on para-Hermitian geometry and related structures (keeping always in mind that we allow complex-valued maps), generalized geometry and Lie and Courant algebroids, and conformal geometry and the Lee form. Then
4This turns out to be analogous to the result on almost-complex structures, which is already known in the literature [22].
6

in Section 3 we study almost para-Hermitian structures in 4-manifolds equipped with a metric of different signatures, and we describe the spaces of such structures in each case. In Section 4 we study integrability issues: half-integrability of para-Hermitian structures, the Lie and Courant algebroids associated to special spacetimes, and a possible notion of "algebroids" for the treatment of weighted fields. In Section 5 we study some connections with twistor theory: two- and three-dimensional twistor spaces, twistor families, and integrability of small deformations of para-complex structures. In Section 6 we make a summary of this work and comment on some possible future directions. We include three appendices: Appendix A with a brief review of spinors in 4 dimensions (in any signature), Appendix B with additional details about the "gauge freedom" and the associated covariant formalism, and Appendix C with some properties of the curvature of the natural connection in the above formalism.

2 Background

2.1 Para-Hermitian and related structures

In the following, M denotes a d-dimensional real, smooth manifold. The definitions still apply if M is complex.

Definition 2.1. Let E  M be a vector bundle with even rank. Let g be a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on the fibers. Given a map K  End(E), we say that (g, K) is a para-Hermitian structure on E if it holds:

1. K2 = +I

2. The ±1 eigenbundles of K have the same rank.

3. g(KX, KY ) = -g(X, Y ) for all X, Y  E.

If we require only the first two conditions, K is said to be a para-complex structure.

Consider a para-Hermitian structure (g, K). The map K gives a decomposition E = L  L~, where L is the (+1)-eigenbundle of K and L~ the (-1)-eigenbundle. Any element

X  E can be written as

X = x + x~

(2.1)

where x  L and x~  L~. In the following, we will extensively use this notational conven-
tion. Note that if x, y  L, i.e. Kx = x and Ky = y, then g(x, y) = g(Kx, Ky) = -g(x, y) so g(x, y)  0 for all x, y  L, and similarly g(x~, y~)  0 for all x~, y~  L~. We then say that L and L~ are isotropic with respect to g, i.e. g|L = 0 = g|L~. The following is a standard result:

Proposition 2.2. We have the isomorphisms L~ = L and L = L~.

Proof. If X  E = L  L~, in general we have g(X, ·)  L  L~. But if x~  L~, then

g(x~, y~) = 0 for all y~  L~ since L~ is isotropic, therefore g(x~, ·)  L. Thus we have a map

L~  L given by

L~  x~  x~ := g(x~, ·)  L,

(2.2)

7

and since g is non-degenerate, the map is an isomorphism. The proof of L = L~ is analogous.

Since here we are not using the abstract index notation, we use the musical isomorphisms  and . From (2.2) it follows that the map

 : E = L  L~  L  L, X = x + x~  (X) = (x, x~)

(2.3)

is also an isomorphism.

Definition 2.3. We say that (g, K) is an almost para-Hermitian structure on a manifold M if (g, K) is a para-Hermitian structure on T M  C.

Remark 2.4. Notice that the map K in Def. 2.3 satisfies the conditions of Def. 2.1 and is allowed to be complex-valued. From this perspective, we can equally well refer to the map J = iK as a "Hermitian structure" in the sense that it satisfies J2 = -I, its eigenbundles have equal rank, and g(J·, J·) = g(·, ·). We choose the terminology `paraHermitian' because it suggests that the eigenbundles are not related to each other (unlike in the usual real-valued Hermitian structures), see Remark 2.9 below. See also Remark 3.3.

Remark 2.5. If (g, K) is an almost para-Hermitian structure on M, and  is a nowhere vanishing scalar field, then (2g, K) is also an almost para-Hermitian structure on M, since (2g)(K·, K·) = -(2g)(·, ·). This means that we can interpret K as an object associated not to a particular metric g but to the conformal class [g] = {2g |   C(M),  > 0}, in the sense that the conditions of definitions 2.3 and 2.1 are satisfied
for any g  [g]. Therefore, conformal invariance will play an important role in our study.
We will refer to ([g], K) as an almost para-Hermitian conformal structure on M.

A para-Hermitian structure (g, K) in M can also be thought of as an "almost-symplectic structure", in the sense that it automatically defines a non-degenerate 2-form (X, Y ) := g(KX, Y ); this is usually called the fundamental 2-form. The relationship of this with conformal geometry is particularly interesting, see Section 2.3 below. The eigenbundles of K are isotropic with respect to , that is |L = 0 and |L~ = 0.
Definition 2.6. An almost para-Kähler structure on a manifold M is an almost paraHermitian structure such that the fundamental 2-form is closed, d = 0.

Although our primary interest is in the case where there is only one para-Hermitian structure, in later sections it will appear naturally the case in which one has more than
one para-complex or complex structure. Because of this, it is useful to recall now the algebras of quaternions H and of para-quaternions (or split-quaternions) H:

H = {q = a + bi + cj + dk | i2 = j2 = k2 = -1, k = ij = -ji}, H = {q = a + bi + cs + dt | i2 = -1, s2 = t2 = 1, t = is = -si}

(2.4) (2.5)

where a, b, c, d  R. The quaternion algebra H is associated to a positive definite quadratic form5 qq¯ = a2 + b2 + c2 + d2, while H is associated to a quadratic form with split signature qq¯ = a2 + b2 - c2 - d2. Based on these algebras, we define:

5The conjugate of a quaternion q is q¯ = a - bi - cj - dk, and the conjugate of a para-quaternion q is q¯ = a - bi - cs - dt.

Definition 2.7. Let M be a real manifold, and let I1, I2, I3 be three anticommuting endomorphisms of T M. Then:

1. (I1, I2, I3) is an almost-hypercomplex (or almost-quaternionic) structure if I1, I2, I3 satisfy the quaternion algebra (2.4). If M is equipped with a metric g, then (g, I1, I2, I3) is an almost-hyperhermitian structure on M if it is almost-hypercomplex and g(IiX, IiY ) = g(X, Y ) for all i = 1, 2, 3 and for all vectors X, Y .
2. (I1, I2, I3) is an almost-para-hypercomplex (or almost-para-quaternionic) structure if I1, I2, I3 satisfy the para-quaternion algebra (2.5). If M is equipped with a metric g, then (g, I1, I2, I3) is an almost-para-hyperhermitian structure on M if it is almostpara-hypercomplex and g(I1X, I1Y ) = g(X, Y ) and g(IiX, IiY ) = -g(X, Y ) for i = 2, 3.

The word `almost' in all the definitions above can be removed by introducing a notion
of integrability. To do this, it is instructive to first briefly recall the situation in complex geometry. An almost-complex structure in a real manifold M is a real map J in T M such that J2 = -I, and whose ±i eigenbundles, denoted T ±M, have the same rank. One has the decomposition T M  C = T +M  T -M (note that the elements in T ±M are necessarily complex). An almost-complex structure is said to be integrable if T +M is an involutive distribution in T M  C, that is [(T +M), (T +M)]  (T +M), where [·, ·] is the Lie bracket of vector fields, and (E) denotes the space of sections of a vector bundle E. A real manifold equipped with an integrable almost-complex structure is a complex
manifold. The integrability condition for J is equivalent to the vanishing of its associated Nijenhuis tensor, where, if A : (T M)  (T M) is a linear map, the Nijenhuis tensor
associated to A is the map NA : (T M) × (T M)  (T M) given by

NA(X, Y

)

=

1 4

A2[X, Y ] + [AX, AY ] - A([AX, Y ] + [X, AY ])

,

(2.6)

for all vector fields X, Y . Mimicking the above definitions for complex structures, we define

Definition 2.8. A (para-)Hermitian structure on a manifold M is an almost (para)Hermitian structure (g, K) such that the Nijenhuis tensor (2.6) associated to K vanishes:

NK  0.

(2.7)

Similarly, a (para-)hyperhermitian structure on M is an almost-(para-)hyperhermitian structure (g, I1, I2, I3) such that NIi  0 for all i = 1, 2, 3.
A crucial difference between integrability of ordinary Hermitian and para-Hermitian structures is the following:

Remark 2.9. The fact that an ordinary almost-complex structure J is a real tensor implies that its eigenbundles are complex conjugates of each other, so J is integrable if and only if both distributions T +M and T -M are involutive. In the para-Hermitian case, the two eigenbundles of a real-valued K are not complex conjugates of each other, so one of the distributions may be involutive while the other one is not. This also applies if K is complex-valued as in Def. 2.3.

9

Recalling the splitting L  L~ induced by K, one can then separate integrability properties associated to the two eigenbundles L and L~. This gives origin to a notion of "half-integrability":

Definition 2.10. We say that an almost para-Hermitian structure (g, K) on M is halfintegrable if one of the eigenbundles of K is involutive. If both eigenbundles are involutive, then K is integrable and (g, K) is a para-Hermitian structure on M.

Remark 2.11. In [6], half-integrable almost-para Hermitian structures on a manifold M (with real-valued K) are called L-para Hermitian or L~-para Hermitian manifolds, depending on whether the (+1)- or the (-1)-eigenbundle is integrable, respectively.

It is useful to introduce the projectors to L and L~; respectively:

P

:=

1 2

(I

+ K),

P~

:=

1 2

(I

-

K).

(2.8)

Using K2 = I, one can easily check that these operators satisfy P 2 = P , P~2 = P~ and P P~ = 0 = P~P . The Nijenhuis tensor (2.6) for A  K can be rewritten in terms of these projectors as [6, Eq. (3.13)]

NK (X, Y )  NP (X, Y ) + NP~(X, Y ),

(2.9)

where

NP (X, Y ) = P~[P X, P Y ], NP~(X, Y ) = P [P~X, P~Y ]

(2.10)

Note that if L is integrable, then [P X, P Y ]  (L) and therefore P~[P X, P Y ] = 0, i.e. NP  0. Hence NP and NP~ govern the involutivity of L and L~ respectively.

Remark 2.12. By Frobenius theorem (see e.g. [27, Theorem 19.21]), if M is a real manifold and one has an involutive distribution L  T M then the collection of all integral manifolds6 of L forms a foliation of M. But if the involutive distribution is complex, i.e. L  T M  C, then the integral manifolds are complex submanifolds living in the complexification of M 7. Since complexification requires real-analyticity of M (which is a restrictive property from the point of view of relativity), in general we will not assume the existence of a foliation. The involutivity of the distribution, however, is well-defined, and is what we mostly need in this work.

Remark 2.13. Since the eigenbundles L and L~ of K are isotropic with respect to the almost-symplectic form , we can refer to them as Lagrangian subbundles. If, say, L is integrable and gives origin to a foliation F , we can refer to F as a Lagrangian foliation.

The integrability of almost-para-Hermitian and related structures is a conformally invariant property. Other properties that are not conformally invariant are also of interest, in particular the Kähler and related conditions:

Definition 2.14. Let M be a real manifold.
6An integral manifold of a distribution L  T M is an immersed submanifold N  M such that TpN = L|p for all p  N . A generic distribution does not admit integral manifolds.
7Note that, given a real manifold M , the complex manifold resulting from an integrable almost-complex structure, and the complexification of M , are two different concepts.

1. An almost-para-Hermitian structure (g, K) on M is para-Kähler if it is para-Hermitian and almost-para-Kähler, that is, K is integrable and d = 0.
2. An almost-para-hyperhermitian structure (g, I1, I2, I3) on M is para-hyperkähler if it is para-hyperhermitian and di = 0, where i(·, ·) = g(Ii·, ·), i = 1, 2, 3.
One can show the following:
Proposition 2.15. Let (g, K) be an almost-para-Hermitian structure on a real manifold M. Then (g, K) is para-Kähler if and only if K is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection of g. Likewise, an almost-para-hyperhermitian structure (g, I1, I2, I3) on M is para-hyperkähler if and only if Ii is parallel w.r.t. the Levi-Civita connection of g for all i = 1, 2, 3.

2.2 Generalized geometry and algebroids

2.2.1 Elementary notions
Let V be a d-dimensional vector space and V  its dual, and consider the space V  V . We will denote elements of V  V  by (X, ), (Y, ), etc. There is a natural inner product ·, · on V V  given by (X, ), (Y, ) = (Y )+(X) 8. Any orthogonal endomorphism, i.e. any elemeny of so(V  V ), can be written as

A B -A

where A  End(V ), B can be viewed as a 2-form in 2V  and  as a bivector in 2V . Exponentiating, one gets elements in SO(V  V ), that can be separated into

exp(B) =

1 B

0 1

,

exp() =

1 01

,

exp(A) =

exp A 0

0 (exp A)-1

.

(2.11)

Remark 2.16. The matrix exp(B) in (2.11) is called a B-transformation, and it can be thought of as a shear transformation in the sense that it fixes projections to V while shearing in the direction of V ; see [2, Chapter 2]. This interpretation and terminology will be particularly well-suited to our purposes in later sections. Analogous considerations apply to the -transformation given by the matrix exp().

While the above is just linear algebra and can be done for any vector space, in Generalized Geometry one applies this to the case where V is the tangent space to a point in a d-dimensional manifold M, and the generalized tangent bundle is defined as TM := T M  T M. The construction above then describes the pointwise structure of TM. The differential structure is described by generalizing the notion of Lie bracket [·, ·] of vector fields to a bracket operation on sections of TM. There are two different bracket operations considered in the literature, the Courant bracket and the Dorfman bracket. Here we choose the Dorfman bracket and denote it by ·, · ; it is defined by

(X, ), (Y, ) = ([X, Y ], £X  - £Y  + d(iY ))
8A factor of 1/2 is often included in the right hand side of this equation, but for our purposes this is not important.

11

where £ denotes the Lie derivative and iY the interior product. The Courant bracket is the skew-symmetrization of the Dorfman bracket. While the ordinary Lie bracket is skewsymmetric and satisfies the Jacobi identity, the Dorfman bracket is not skew-symmetric, but it satisfies the Jacobi identity. In turn, the Courant bracket is skew-symmetric, but it does not satisfy the Jacobi identity.
2.2.2 Lie and Courant algebroids In the literature one frequently encounters real Lie algebroids, but in this work we need the complexified versions (although the manifold is still real). This is also used in e.g. [2], see Chapter 3 therein.
Definition 2.17. A (complex) Lie algebroid is a triple (L, [·, ·]L, ) where L  M is a complex vector bundle, [·, ·]L : (L)×(L)  (L) is a bilinear map, and  : L  T M C is a bundle map called anchor, such that, for all X, Y, Z  (L) and f  C(M), the following four conditions are satisfied9:
1. [X, Y ]L = -[Y, X]L.
2. JacL(X, Y, Z) := [X, [Y, Z]L]L + [Z, [X, Y ]L]L + [Y, [Z, X]L]L = 0.
3. ([X, Y ]L) = [(X), (Y )], where [·, ·] is the Lie bracket of vector fields.
4. [X, f Y ]L = ((X)f )Y + f [X, Y ]L.
From the first item we see that [·, ·]L is skew-symmetric, and the second means that the Jacobiator for [·, ·]L vanishes, or, in other words, the Jacobi identity for [·, ·]L is satisfied. Together, these two items imply that [·, ·]L is a Lie bracket. The third item means that  is a morphism, and from the fourth item we see that the anchor and the bracket are subject to the Leibniz rule.
The following are standard examples of Lie algebroids, taken from [2, Chapter 3]:
Example 2.18. The tangent bundle T M gives origin to the tangent Lie algebroid (T M, [·, ·], I), where the bracket is the Lie bracket of vector fields and the anchor is the identity map.
Example 2.19. If L  T M is an involutive distribution, then (L, [·, ·]L, IL) is a Lie algebroid, with [·, ·]L and IL the restrictions of, respectively, the Lie bracket and the identity map of T M to the subbundle L.
We will need some objects that can be naturally constructed from the structures in a Lie algebroid: Definition 2.20 (Def. 3.7 and 3.8 in [2]). Let (L, [·, ·]L, ) be a Lie algebroid, let k = kL for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., and let   (k) and X0, ..., Xk  (L).
9The anchor  extends to a map between sections (L)  (T M  C) that we also denote by .
12

1. The Lie algebroid exterior derivative is the map dL : (k)  (k+1) defined by

(dL)(X0, ..., Xk) = (-1)i(Xi)(X0, ..., X^i, ..., Xk)
i
+ (-1)i+j([Xi, Xj]L, X0, ..., X^i, ..., X^j, ..., Xk)
i<j

(2.12)

where the notation X^i means that the vector Xi is omitted.
2. The generalized Lie derivative £L of  along X  (L) is the operator defined in terms of dL by Cartan's formula

£LX  = iX dL + dLiX 

(2.13)

where iX denotes interior product, iX  = (X, ...).

As examples of the exterior derivative (2.12), if f  (0) and   (1) then

(dLf )(X) = (X)f, (dL)(X, Y ) = (X)(Y ) - (Y )(X) - ([X, Y ]L).

(2.14) (2.15)

Remark 2.21 (de Rham complexes). The fact that the bracket of a Lie algebroid satisfies the Jacobi identity, together with the morphism property of the anchor, imply that the Lie algebroid exterior derivative dL satisfies dL  dL = 0. Therefore, ((·), dL) is a cochain complex (see e.g. [2, Chapter 3]). This will be particularly important in sections 4.2, 4.3.

Definition 2.22 (Def. 3.1 in [5]). A Courant algebroid is a quadruple (E, ·, · , , ·, · ) where: E  M is a vector bundle, ·, · : (E) × (E)  C(M) is a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form,  : E  T M is a bundle map called anchor, and ·, · : (E) × (E)  (E) is a bilinear operation called Dorfman bracket, subject to the following axioms for all X, Y, Z  (E):

1. (X) Y, Z = X, Y , Z + Y, X, Z

2.

X, X , Y

=

1 2

(Y

)

X, X

3. X, Y, Z = X, Y , Z + Y, X, Z

In terms of the Dorfman bracket, the axioms in Definition 2.22 have the following

meaning: the first axiom means invariance of the inner product with respect to the bracket;

from the second axiom we see that the bracket is not skew-symmetric; and the third axiom

means that the bracket satisfies the Jacobi identity.

The definition of a Courant algebroid can be given using two different bracket opera-

tions: the Courant bracket ·, · Cour or the Dorfman bracket ·, · . The difference is that one can require the bracket either to be skew-symmetric (Courant) or to satisfy the Jacobi

identity (Dorfman), but not both. The original definition, introduced in [28], is in terms

of the Courant bracket. The two brackets are related by

X, Y

Cour

=

1 2

(

X, Y

- Y, X ).

Remark 2.23. If only the first and second axioms in Definition 2.22 are required, the bracket is said to be metric-compatible. The quadruple (E, ·, · , , ·, · ) is then called metric algebroid [4].

13

From the axioms in Definition 2.22 one can deduce two additional identities:

X, f Y = ((X)f )Y + f X, Y , ( X, Y ) = [(X), (Y )]

(2.16) (2.17)

for any f  C(M). The first identity means that the anchor and the bracket satisfy the Leibniz rule; the second identity means that  is a morphism of bundles. These identities are sometimes included as part of the definition of a Courant algebroid, but it is known that they can be obtained from the axioms: to prove (2.16), compute X, f Y , Z for Z  (E) arbitrary and use the first axiom; to prove (2.17), compute both sides independently applied to Z, W for arbitrary Z, W  (E), and use the first and third axioms.
As shown in [28], a natural example of a Courant algebroid can be obtained from a Lie bialgebroid. A related example, which is key for our purposes, is the following:

Proposition 2.24 (See e.g. Example 2.6 in [7]). Let (L, [·, ·]L, L) be a Lie algebroid, and consider the vector bundle L  L. Denote sections of L  L by (X, ), (Y, ) etc., and
introduce the following maps:

LL ((X, )) = X, (X, ), (Y, ) LL = (Y ) + (X), (X, ), (Y, ) LL = ([X, Y ]L, £LX - £LY  + dL(iY ))
where dL and £L were defined in Definition 2.20. Then the quadruple

(2.18) (2.19) (2.20)

(L  L, ·, · LL, LL, ·, · LL)

(2.21)

is a Courant algebroid, with inner product ·, · LL, anchor LL and Dorfman bracket ·, · LL.

This procedure for constructing Courant algebroids from Lie algebroids is particularly natural in manifolds with a foliation, as described by Vaisman in [5, Section 3]. The following result is essentially Proposition 3.1 in [5] (see also [7, Section 3.4]):

Proposition 2.25. Let (g, K) be an almost-para Hermitian structure on a d-dimensional real manifold M (Def. 2.3). Let L and L~ be the two eigenbundles of K, and assume that L is involutive. Then the quadruple

(T M  C, g, P, ·, · )

is a Courant algebroid, where the inner product g is the metric, the anchor P is the projector (2.8) to L, and the Dorfman bracket is
X, Y = -1( (x, x~), (y, y~) LL).
Here,  and  are the isomorphisms (2.3) and (2.2), ·, · LL is the Dorfman bracket (2.20), and x = P X, x~ = P~X, y = P Y , y~ = P~Y are the decompositions of vectors induced by K.

14

Proof. The tangent bundle splits as T M C = LL~, where L and L~ are the eigenbundles of K and L is involutive. From Example 2.19, the distribution L defines a Lie algebroid (L, [·, ·]L, IL). Therefore, applying Proposition 2.24, the quadruple

(L  L, ·, · LL, LL, ·, · LL)

(2.22)

is a Courant algebroid, where the anchor, inner product and Dorfman bracket are given by (2.18), (2.19) and (2.20). Now one simply has to transfer this structure to T M  C using the isomorphisms  and  (eqs. (2.3), (2.2)). Any elements X, Y  (T M  C) can be written as X = x + x~ and Y = y + y~, where x, y,  (L) and x~, y~  (L~). Using these decompositions, and the fact that g|L = 0 = g|L~, a brief calculation shows that
g(X, Y ) = (x, x~), (y, y~) LL,
so the metric g plays the role of the inner product in Def. 2.22. Furthermore, recalling the projector P given in (2.8) and using again X = x + x~, we have

P (x + x~) = x = LL((x, x~))

so P plays the role of the anchor. Finally, let us see the Dorfman bracket. Since any elements ,   (L) can be written as  = x~,  = y~ for some x~, y~  (L~), the Dorfman bracket (2.20) is

(x, x~), (y, y~) LL = ([x, y]L, £Lx y~ - £Ly x~ + dLg(x~, y))

(2.23)

where we recall that by definition, x~(y)  g(x~, y). The right hand side of (2.23) is, of course, an element of L  L. In order to map this to L  L~, one uses the inverse isomorphisms  : L  L~ and -1 : L  L  L  L~, which map L  L  (z, )  -1((z, )) = z +   L  L~. Replacing (z, ) by the right hand side of (2.23), we get

x + x~, y + y~  -1( (x, x~), (y, y~) LL) = [x, y] + £Lx y~ - £Ly x~ + dLg(x~, y)  .
(This is the unnumbered equation above eq. (20) in [7].)

(2.24)

2.3 Conformal geometry and the Lee form

As noticed in Remark 2.5, conformal invariance plays an important role in our work.
Recall that, given a manifold M and a metric g on it, the conformal class of g is defined as [g] = {2g |   C(M),  > 0}. We refer to the pair (M, [g]) as a conformal structure. The elements in [g] are called conformal representatives.

Definition 2.26. Let (M, [g]) be a conformal structure. A Weyl connection is a linear, torsion-free connection w such that for any conformal representative g  [g], it holds wg = -2f  g for some 1-form f . We call f the Weyl 1-form.

Under a change of conformal representative g  g^ = 2g, by definition we must have wg^ = -2f^ g^ for some 1-form f^. Replacing g^ = 2g on the left hand side, we see that f and f^ are related by (from now on we will frequently use the abstract index notation)

f^a = fa - (d log )a.

(2.25)

15

If we choose a metric g  [g] with Levi-Civita connection , the relationship between w and  is given by a tensor field Q : (T M) × (T M)  (T M). Explicitly, one has

g(wXY, Z) = g(XY, Z) + g(Q(X, Y ), Z),

where

g(Q(X, Y ), Z) = f (X)g(Y, Z) + f (Y )g(X, Z) - f (Z)g(X, Y ).

In index notation this can be expressed as

waY b = aY b + QacbY c,

(2.26)

where

Qacb = cbfa + abfc - gbdgacfd.

(2.27)

There are interesting relations between the 1-form f associated to a Weyl connection
and certain properties of almost para-Hermitian structures. This dates back to the original
work of H. C. Lee in [29] on almost symplectic manifolds (M, aab): M is a d-dimensional manifold (with d even) and aab = a[ab] is a non-degenerate 2-form. The inverse of aab is (a-1)ab, so that (a-1)acacb = ab. Lee defines the "curvature tensor" of aab as (da)abc, and the "curvature vector" as (a-1)bc(da)abc. Two such spaces (M, aab) and (M^ , ^aab) are said to be "conformal" to each other if there exists a scalar field  such that

a^ab = aab.

(2.28)

Assuming d > 2 and defining the 1-form

ka

:=

1 (d-2)

(a-1)bc

(da)abc,

it is observed in [29] that k^a and ka are related by

k^a = ka - (d log )a

(2.29)

It follows from this that (dk)ab = (dk^)ab, so (dk)ab is called the "first conformal curvature tensor" by Lee. There is also a "second conformal curvature tensor": a 3-form cabc given

by

cabc := (da)abc + (k  a)abc.

(2.30)

The tensors cabc and c^abc are related by c^abc = cabc.
Now, as already noticed, a manifold with an almost-para-Hermitian structure (g, K) comes automatically with an almost-symplectic form ab = gcbKca. Therefore, we may take aab  ab in Lee's construction. Since KacKcb = ab, we have (-1)ab = gacgbdcd  ab. Under a conformal transformation of the metric, gab  g^ab = 2gab, the new almostsymplectic 2-form is ^ab = 2ab. Thus, we take  = 2 in (2.28) and subsequent
formulas, and we define:

Definition 2.27. Let ([g], K) be an almost (para-)Hermitian conformal structure on a d-dimensional manifold M, with d > 2. For a choice g  [g], let  be the associated almost-symplectic 2-form. We define the Lee form as

a

=

1 2(d-2)

bc(d

)abc.

(2.31)

16

If a is the Levi-Civita connection of gab, a short calculation using abab = -d shows

that (2.31) can be written as

a

=

1 (d-2)

K

bcbK

c

a.

This

is

equivalent

to

or

in

index-free

notation:

(X )

=

-

1 (d-2)

( )(K X )

(2.32)

for any vector field X, where  is the codifferential. From (2.29) and (2.31) we see that the Lee form a has exactly the transformation
property of a Weyl 1-form under conformal transformations of the metric gab  g^ab = 2gab (i.e. a  ^a = a - (d log )a). Therefore, from the discussion above, we deduce:

Proposition 2.28. An almost (para-)Hermitian structure (g, K) on M induces a natural Weyl connection in the conformal structure (M, [g]), by taking the Lee form as the Weyl 1-form, a  fa.

This motivates the following definition:

Definition 2.29. Let ([g], K) be an almost (para-)Hermitian conformal structure on M, and let w be a Weyl connection. We say that w and K are compatible if the Weyl 1-form associated to w and the Lee form associated to K coincide (in other words, w
is induced by K).

Remark 2.30. In the literature, see e.g. [30, Section 4] (also [18]), the usual definition of

compatibility of a Weyl connection w with a Hermitian structure K is that they must

satisfy

w

aK

a b

=

0.

(2.33)

Using (2.26)-(2.27), it follows easily that this is true if and only if the condition of Definition 2.29 holds, namely the Weyl 1-form is equal to the Lee form. Thus, the two definitions coincide. However, we have chosen Def. 2.29 since it is an immediate consequence of Lee's construction, while the geometric meaning of requiring (2.33) as a compatibility condition is not clear to us.

Finally, from Lee's results [29] and the definitions given in Section 2.1 we have:

Proposition 2.31 (Lee [29]). Let (g, K) be an almost (para-)Hermitian structure on a d-dimensional manifold M. Then:

1. (g, K) is almost (para-)Kähler if and only if the Lee form (2.31) vanishes.

2. For d = 4, (g, K) is locally conformally almost (para-)Kähler if and only if the Lee form is closed.

3. For d > 4, (g, K) is locally conformally almost (para-)Kähler if and only if cabc  0 (where cabc is defined in (2.30)).

Proof. The first item follows from the definitions of almost (para-)Kähler (Def. 2.6, d = 0) and the Lee form (2.31). The second and third items are Theorem 5 in [29].

3 Almost para-Hermitian structures in four dimensions

3.1 Self-dual forms

Consider a 4-dimensional, orientable, real manifold M, equipped with a metric. Let k(M) = kT M be the space of k-forms. The Hodge star operator  can be seen as a map  : 2(M)  2(M) satisfying 2 = (-1)s, where s is the number of (-1)'s appearing
in the signature of the metric. Thus, in Riemannian (s = 0) and split (s = 2) signature,  always defines a para-complex structure in 2(M), whereas in Lorentz signature (s = 3) it defines a complex structure in 2(M). The eigenvalues of  are ± (-1)s. The space
of 2-forms is then decomposed as

2(M ) = 2+(M )  2-(M )

(3.1)

where 2+(M) is the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue + (-1)s, and 2-(M) corresponds to - (-1)s. Elements of 2+(M) are called self-dual (SD) 2-forms, and elements of 2-(M) are anti-self-dual (ASD) 2-forms.

Theorem 3.1. Let M be a real, 4-dimensional, orientable manifold with a metric g, let A  Aut(T M  C) and let W be a bilinear map defined by

W (X, Y ) = g(AX, Y )

(3.2)

for any vectors X, Y . Furthermore, let a be a non-vanishing scalar10. Then A satisfies the conditions

A2 = aI, g(AX, AY ) = - ag(X, Y )

(3.3) (3.4)

if and only if the map W is either a self-dual or an anti-self-dual 2-form.

Proof. We will use the abstract index notation, and the metric and its inverse to raise
and lower indices as convenient. Notice that since A is an automorphism, the map W in (3.2) is non-degenerate. Appendix B in [31] will be useful in the following. Since
M is orientable, it has a volume 4-form abcd, and the metric allows to normalize it as abcdabcd = (-1)s4!.
Assume first that A  Aut(T M  C) satisfies (3.3) and (3.4). In index notation this
is

AacAcb = aab, gcdAcaAdb = - agab

(3.5) (3.6)

with a = 0. The bilinear map (3.2) is Wab = gbcAca. Multiplying by Abd and using (3.6):

WabAbd = gbcAcaAbd = -agad.

Contracting now with Adc and using (3.5):

WabAbdAdc = aWac = -agadAdc = -aWca,

10For the case a = 0, see Remark 3.7 below.

18

which shows that Wac = -Wca and therefore Wab is a 2-form. Now we want to show that it is (A)SD. We can write the volume form as abcd = N W[abWcd], where N is determined by the normalization of abcd. Expanding the skew-symmetrization:

abcd

=

N 3

(Wab

Wcd

+ WacWdb

+

WadWbc).

Contracting with W cd and using that Wab = -Wba:

abcdW cd

=

N 3

(WabWcdW

cd

+

2WacWdbW cd).

Now, using that Wdb = gebAed and W cd = gcegdf Wef , we have

WdbW cd = AcdAdb = acb

from which it also follows that WcdW cd = -4a. Therefore

abcdW cd

=

-

2 3

N

aWab

.

Using now the normalization of abcd:

(-1)s4!

=

abcdabcd

=

N abcdWabWcd

=

8 3

N

thus N a = ±3 (-1)s.

Replacing

in

(3.7)

and

using

the

definition

Wab

=

1 2

abcd

W

cd,

we

get

(3.7)

Wab =  (-1)s Wab,

which shows that Wab must be (A)SD.
Suppose now that the map W defined in (3.2) is a 2-form. Writing the volume form again as abcd = N W[abWcd], and using the normalization abcdabcd = (-1)s4!, a short calculation reveals that (-1)s4! = 2N W abWab, thus

N = 12(-1)s(W abWab)-1.

(3.8)

Now, from formula (B.2.13) in [31] we have

(-1)s3!ab = cdeacdeb

Replacing cdeb = N W[cdWeb] and the expression for N , we get the general identity ab = -4(W deWde)-1 W acWcb.

Assume now that Wab is (A)SD:

Wab = Wab,

where  = ± (-1)s, depending on the signature of g and on whether we consider SD or

ASD forms. In any case, the above identity becomes

ab = -4(W deWde)-1 W acWcb,

(3.9)

which

shows

that

Aab

=

gacWbc

satisfies

(3.5),

with

a

Finally,

to

see

that

(3.4) holds, we compute

gcdAcaAdb = -WdaAdb = -agab

where the second equality is deduced form (3.5) by contracting with gda.

19

Corollary 3.2. Let A  Aut(T M  C) and let W be defined by (3.2). Define a scalar field , a bilinear map , and a map K  Aut(T M  C) by, respectively,

for any vectors X, Y . Then K satisfies the conditions

K2 = I, g(KX, KY ) = - g(X, Y )

(3.13) (3.14)

if and only if  is either a self-dual or an anti-self-dual 2-form.

Remark 3.3. Suppose that  in (3.11) is an (A)SD 2-form. Then the map K defined in (3.12) satisfies equations (3.13) and (3.14), and its eigenvalues are +1, +1, -1, -1 so the two eigenbundles of K have the same rank. According to definitions 2.1 and 2.3, we say that (g, K) is an almost para-Hermitian structure. Notice that K is not necessarily real-valued, this is the reason why we use T M  C instead of T M in Def. 2.3. The reality of K depends on the signature of g:

1. Riemannian signature (+ + ++): (A)SD forms can be chosen to be real, but  in (3.10) is always purely imaginary, so K is purely imaginary or complex-valued.

2. Split signature (+ + --): (A)SD forms can be chosen to be real, but  can be real or complex, so K can be real- or complex-valued.

3. Lorentz signature (+---): (A)SD forms are necessarily complex, so K is complexvalued.

3.2 Spaces of almost para-Hermitian structures

The results of Theorem 3.1 and its Corollary 3.2 show us that we can think of maps satisfying (3.13) and (3.14) equivalently in terms of non-degenerate (A)SD 2-forms. Here we will give a convenient parametrization of the space of such maps at a point x  M, that is of the space

Px := {K  Aut(TxM  C) | K2 = I and g(K·, K·) = -g(·, ·)}.

(3.15)

As emphasized in Remark 3.3, we consider K  Aut(TxM  C) since a tensor satisfying (3.13)-(3.14) is not necessarily real. Imposing reality conditions changes the structure of
Px, and this will depend on the metric signature. Our results in this subsection can be summarized in the following form:

Theorem 3.4. Let M be a real, orientable 4-manifold with a metric g, and let x  M. The space (3.15) has two connected components, and depending on the signature of g, each component can be parametrized as follows:

20

1. Riemannian signature: the elements in the set (3.15) are not real but can be chosen

to be purely imaginary, and each of the two components in the space of such maps

is

Px(R) = CP1 = S2

(3.16)

where CP1 is the complex projective line, and S2 is the unit 2-sphere.

2. Split signature: the elements in the set (3.15) can be chosen to be real, and each of the two components in the space of such maps is

Px(S) = (RP1 × RP1)\RP1 = H1

(3.17)

where RP1 is the real projective line, and H1 is a hyperboloid of one sheet.

3. Lorentz signature: the elements in the set (3.15) are necessarily complex, and each of the two components in the space of such maps is

Px(L) = (CP1 × CP1)\CP1 = CS2 where CS2 is the complexified 2-sphere.

(3.18)

Remark 3.5. The result (3.16) is analogous to the result about almost-complex structures in Riemannian geometry, which is already known in the literature (see Remark 3.8 below).

We will first analyse the general structure of (3.15) and then study the different signatures separately.
First of all, the two connected components in Px refer to the fact that, if K  Px, then the 2-form (·, ·) = g(K·, ·) can be self-dual or anti-self-dual. We will focus on only one of the components of Px; the analysis for the other is analogous.
The parametrization of Px involves the use of spinors. We refer to Appendix A for a brief review of spinors in four dimensions, as well as for notation and conventions (see also Appendix B for spinor fields). In particular, we raise and lower spinor indices with the symplectic forms AB, AB and their inverses. In any signature, the spaces of SD and ASD 2-forms have the spinor decomposition

2+(M ) = S  S,

2-(M ) = S  S,

(3.19)

where S and S are the (dual) primed and unprimed spinor bundles (see the beginning
of Appendix B). In indices, this means that if Wa+b is SD, and Wa-b is ASD, then there exist symmetric spinors AB = (AB) and AB = (AB) such that

Wa+b = AB AB , Wa-b = AB AB .

(3.20) (3.21)

These

2-forms

are

non-degenerate

if

and

only

if

 AB AB

=

0

and

AB AB

=

0

respec-

tively. In the following, since we will focus on only one of the two components of Px, we are free to choose to work with either SD or ASD forms. For concreteness, from now on

we will focus on the ASD case (the SD case being entirely analogous), that is on forms

like (3.21), and we omit the superscript "-" since it will not be needed.

21

Remark 3.6 (Convention). If a tensor/spinor depends non-trivially only on unprimed

spinors, we will often refer to it as having "negative chirality", while if it depends only on

primed spinors we will say that it has "positive chirality". For example, we say that A

or

T

a b

=

 ABA B

have

negative

chirality,

and

that

UaB

=

A AB

or

Vab

=

AB AB

have

positive chirality. More formally, the notions of negative and positive chirality refer to the

two kinds of representations of the spin group (in the notation of appendix A, negative

chirality corresponds to representations (n, 0), and positive chirality to (0, m)).

Remark 3.7 (Null-Kähler). We notice that the proof of Theorem 3.1 is particularly simple if one uses the isomorphisms (3.1), (3.19) and the explicit expressions (3.20) and (3.21). Actually, these decompositions also allow to deal with the case a = 0 in (3.3). Suppose that N  End(T N  C) satisfies N2 = 0 and g(NX, Y ) + g(X, NY ) = 0 for all X, Y . Then using (3.1), (3.19)­(3.21), it is straightforward to show that any N satisfying these conditions must be of the form

N

a b

=

AB A B

or

N

a b

=

µA µB AB

(3.22)

for some spinors A, µA, depending on whether the 2-form g(N ·, ·) is SD or ASD. We
may refer to the pair (g, N) as an `almost-null Kähler structure'. It follows that the space of such maps at a point x  M is simply the space of spinors at x. If the spinor A (or µA) is parallel under the Levi-Civita connection of g, then this is called a Null-Kähler
structure, see [32] and [33, Section 10.2.3]. (If N is real, then the signature of g must be
split, however here we allow N to be complex.)

Let Wab be an ASD 2-form at x  M, with the spinor representation (3.21), and

let (A, A) be a basis of S|x, where AA =  = 0. Then AB can expanded as (see

Appendix A)

AB = -2[2AB - 1(AB + AB) + 0AB],

(3.23)

where 0 = ABAB, 1 = ABAB and 2 = ABAB. The scalar (3.10) is then



=

(-

1 2

AB

AB

)1/2

=

-1(21

- 02)1/2.

Thus,

the

tensor

K

a b

=

-1gacWbc

satisfies

(3.13) and (3.14) and is explicitly

Kab = 

1 21 - 02

2AB - 1(AB + AB) + 0AB

A B .

(3.24)

This can be written in a more convenient form by expressing AB in terms of its principal

spinors, see Appendix A: since ABAB = 0, there exist two non-proportional spinors

A, A such that

AB = AB + BA.

(3.25)

Independently of signature, the spinors A and A are in general complex, since they are obtained by finding the roots of a second order polynomial; see around eq. (A.10). However, whereas in Lorentzian and Riemmanian signature they are necessarily complex,
in split signature the combination in the right hand side of (3.25) is real. The decomposition (3.25) implies that  = CC, therefore

Kab = (C C )-1(AB + AB)A B .

(3.26)

22

From Corollary 3.2 we see that any map satisfying conditions (3.13) and (3.14) in four dimensions has the form (3.26) for some spinors A, A (the only other possibility being choosing positive instead of negative chirality). However, (3.26) does not uniquely fix these spinors: we see from this equation that K is invariant under

A  A, A  µA

(3.27)

for any non-vanishing scalars  and µ. Now, the space of spinors at a point (the fiber

of the spin bundle) is C2 in signature (+ - --) and (+ + ++), and R2 in signature

(+ + --). Since any element of the set (3.15) (with negative chirality) can be put in

the form (3.26), and since the spinors are subject to the projective equivalence (3.27), we

deduce that a priori each component of the set Px can be parametrized by the product of two projective spaces, that is CP1 × CP1. (Notice that although in the split signature case the projective spin space is RP1, if we allow the rescalings in (3.27) to be complex

then we get the complexification of RP1, which is CP1.) But since the spinors A and A are not allowed to be proportional, we must remove the "diagonal" from CP1 × CP1, so

we get

Px = {(, )  CP1 × CP1 |  = } = (CP1 × CP1)\CP1

(3.28)

where we are now abusing notation and using Px for one of the two components of (3.15). Requiring reality conditions for (3.26), however, imposes additional restrictions on the spinors A, A. We will analyse separately the different signatures.

3.2.1 Riemannian signature

In this case we can require the ASD 2-form Wab to be real. To analyse this in more

detail, we need to introduce the Euclidean spinor conjugation. This is an involution 

on the spin spaces, i.e. S  S and S  S (so it does not interchange the chirality as

in the Lorentzian case), and if we write a spinor A in components as A = (a, b), then

A

=

(-¯b, a¯).

It

follows

that

2

=

-1.

Since

 AB

=

AB ,

we

get

that

Wab

is

real

if

and

only if A = iA , so Wab = i(AB + A B)AB. Furthermore, (CC)-1 = -i/  2,

where  2 := ABAB. Therefore, with the additional requirement of real ASD 2-

forms, the map (3.26) becomes in the Riemannian case

K

a b

=

1 

2 (AB

+ AB)AB ,

(3.29)

so we see explicitly that K is parametrized by only one projective spinor. Each of the two components of the set of "Riemannian para-Hermitian structures" at x  M is therefore

Px(R) = CP1.

(3.30)

The complex projective line CP1 is the Riemann sphere, and is topologically CP1 = S2. Thus, there is a 2-sphere of Riemannian para-Hermitian structures at any point.

Remark 3.8. From (3.29) we see immediately that K is purely imaginary, since 2 = -1. Therefore, the map
J := iK

23

is real-valued and satisfies J2 = -I, so it defines a complex structure in each tangent space,
and the space of complex (Hermitian) structures at any point is again parametrized by CP1. In this way we recover the Riemannian results for almost-complex structures given in [34, Section 9.1] and [22] (see eq. (9.1.20) in the first reference and page 429 in the
second).

The 2-sphere (3.30) of Riemannian para-Hermitian structures can also be seen by using non-projective spinors as follows. From the general form (3.24), choosing different values for 0, 1, 2 we deduce the following particular cases

(K1)ab = -1(AB + AB)AB , (K2)ab = i-1(AB + AB)AB , (K3)ab = -1(AB - AB)AB

(3.31) (3.32) (3.33)

(where reality conditions imply A = iA ). Any K can be expressed as a linear combination of these tensors11. It is straightforward to check the following identities:

(K1)2 = (K2)2 = (K3)2 = I, KiKj = -KjKi for i = j.

(3.35)

Using these properties, a short calculation shows that

(aK1 + bK2 + cK3)2 = (a2 + b2 + c2)I,

(3.36)

where a, b, c are real numbers. Thus, as long as (a, b, c)  S2, the combination K(a,b,c) = aK1 + bK2 + cK3 is a new para-Hermitian structure parametrized by an element (a, b, c) of S2, so there is a 2-sphere of such structures.
Since the Ki are all purely imaginary, we can define the real maps J1 = iK1, J2 = iK2 and J3 = iK3; then it follows that these tensors satisfy

(Ji)2 = -I,

J1J2 = J3, J2J3 = J1, J3J1 = J2,

(3.37)

so the triple (J1, J2, J3) defines an almost-hyperhermitian structure on M (Def. 2.7).

3.2.2 Split signature

In signature (+ + --) spinors can be chosen to be real. Therefore, the reality of the map (3.24) depends on the sign of 21 -02. This is equivalent to the reality conditions for the principal spinors A and A in (3.25): if 21 - 02 > 0 then A and A are real, whereas if 21 - 02 < 0 they are complex; see around equation (A.10). Thus, requiring (3.24) to be real, and hence an ordinary para-Hermitian structure, is equivalent to requiring A
and A in (3.26) to be real. We can thus restrict to real rescalings in (3.27), so the space
of para-Hermitian structures at x (of a definite chirality) is

Px(S) = {(, )  RP1 × RP1 |  = } = (RP1 × RP1)\RP1.
11Note that (3.24) is equivalent to

The real projective line RP1 is topologically RP1 = S1, so the space of para-Hermitian structures at any point in split signature is the torus S1 ×S1 with the line  =  removed.
To visualize this structure, we consider again the three cases (3.31), (3.32), (3.33), where
now A and A are real spinors. We see that K1 and K3 are real, but K2 is purely imaginary, so we define the real map K2 = iK2. These tensors satisfy the following:

(K1)2 = (K3)2 = I = -(K2 )2,

K1K2 = -K2 K1 = K3.

(3.39)

From these relations and definition 2.7 we see that the triple (K1, K2 , K3) defines an almost-para-hyperhermitian structure. If a, b, c are real numbers, we now find

(aK1 + bK2 + cK3)2 = (a2 - b2 + c2)I,

(3.40)

thus the condition for aK1 + bK2 + cK3 to be an almost-para-Hermitian structure is a2 - b2 + c2 = 1, which describes a hyperboloid. Therefore, the space (3.38) is in this case a hyperboloid of one sheet. One can also convince oneself of this by drawing (S1 × S1)\S1 (where we think of the removed S1 as a "diagonal" circle --i.e. non-contractible).

Remark 3.9 (Almost-complex structures). An analysis analogous to the one that leads

to (3.28) can be carried out to find the set of almost complex structures compatible with g in split signature (i.e. maps satisfying J2 = -I and g(J·, J·) = +g(·, ·)). Requiring J

to be real, it is straightforward to see (cf. around eq. (A.10)) that the principal spinors

must be complex. Since they are complex conjugates of each other, i.e. A = ¯A, J is parametrized by only one spinor A, and one finds

Jab

=

-

i (C ¯C

)

(A¯B

+

¯AB)A B

(3.41)

(note that this is real since (C¯C) = -(C¯C)). We have the freedom A  A with   C×, and we must exclude the set ¯A  A, so it follows that the set of Hermitian structures at a point is CP1\RP1. Topologically this is S2\S1, which is homemorphic to a hyperboloid of two sheets. This can also be seen by simply requiring a2 - b2 + c2 = -1
in (3.40). We will invoke this result in section 5.2.1 below.

3.2.3 Lorentz signature

As observed in Remark 3.3, in this case the elements of the set (3.15) are necessarily complex-valued, and Px(L) is simply given by (3.28). Topologically, this is the product S2 ×S2 of two 2-spheres with the "diagonal"  =  removed. We can obtain an alternative
description of this structure by considering again the three maps (3.31), (3.32), (3.33).
These tensors satisfy (3.35), but now they are complex-valued. Considering K(a,b,c) = aK1 + bK2 + cK3, equation (3.36) still holds, but now a, b, c are complex numbers. The condition for K(a,b,c) to be a "Lorentzian para-Hermitian structure" is thus

a2 + b2 + c2 = 1, a, b, c  C

(3.42)

which is the complexification of the 2-sphere, CS2. (In this case it is perhaps not so easy to argue intuitively that the set (S2 × S2)\S2 is a complex 2-sphere.)
Each of the two components in the set (3.15), without any reality conditions, is therefore a complexified sphere CS2. Notice that this is true in any signature, and also for
complex 4-manifolds.

25

3.3 Gauge freedom and a covariant formalism

From Remark 2.5 and the results of section 3.2, we see that fixing a (para-)complex structure K at a point x  M is equivalent to fixing (ignoring reality conditions):

1. a conformal structure [g], and

2. two (different) points on the Riemann sphere at x.

Over an open neighbourhood in M, instead of considering point objects we consider
fields, i.e. smooth sections of the appropriate bundles. In practice we will work with
representatives, i.e. with some metric gab, or its spinor equivalents AB and AB, and with two non-proportional spinors A, A (which in split signature are real, while in Riemannian signature one has A = iA ). But since the only given data is K, the framework should not depend on the representatives chosen. Here we give the essential

points of a formalism that takes into account this issue, namely that is covariant under the transformations associated to this "gauge freedom". A more detailed description of

this framework is given in Appendix B.

We have seen that the explicit expression of K in terms of the representative spinors

is (3.26), that is:

K

a b

=

(CD

1 C

D

)

AE

(E

B

+ E B)A B .

(3.43)

We are free to assign conformal weights to the spinors A, A, i.e. we can impose these spinors to change under a conformal transformation of the metric as

A  w0+1A,

A  w1+1A

(3.44)

for some real numbers w0, w1. Recalling the conformal behavior

AB  AB ,

AB  AB .

(3.45)

we see explicitly from (3.43) that K is invariant under conformal rescalings. (The conformal weights in (3.44) are chosen so that A  w0A, A  w1A.)
The "gauge freedom" is given by conformal (3.45) and projective (3.27) rescalings. In Lorentzian and Riemannian signature, these transformations define the group12 Go = C× × C× × R+, where R+ corresponds to conformal rescalings (3.45) and C× × C× to projective rescalings (3.27). In split signature one replaces C× × C× by R× × R×.

A non-trivial issue is how to define a derivative operator that is covariant under all the transformations involved, since, to begin with, in a conformal structure one does not have the usual Levi-Civita connection. The first point is to apply Lee's construction, seen in Section 2.3, to use the natural Weyl connection wa induced by an almost-para Hermitian conformal structure ([g], K) (Proposition 2.28). Then, after applying the appropriate machinery, one arrives at:

Definition 3.11. Let (M, [g], K) be a real, 4-dimensional, almost-para-Hermitian con-

formal structure, and let A, A be the spinor fields representing K as in (3.26), with

ABAB =  = 0. Let wAA and fAA be the Weyl connection and Lee form induced by

(3.48) (3.49)

(with w0 and w1 defined by (3.44)), and where AA is any Levi-Civita connection in the conformal class.

To understand the construction of (3.47), we refer to the discussion that leads to eq. (B.9) in Appendix B. Under a gauge transformation (3.46), CAA satisfies

(3.50)

The projection of CAA into the eigenbundles of K deserves special attention, so we introduce:

Definition 3.12. Let (M, [g], K) be a real, 4-dimensional, almost-para-Hermitian conformal structure, and let A, A be the spinor fields representing K as in (3.26). Let CAA be the associated covariant derivative, defined by (3.47). We define the operators

C~A := ACAA,

CA := ACAA.

(3.51)

27

Remark 3.13. Let (g, K) be an almost-para-Hermitian structure, let P and P~ be the associated projectors (2.8) to its eigenbundles, and let A, A be the spinor fields rep-
resenting K (eq. (3.26)). Furthermore, let  be an arbitrary derivative operator, and
X  (T M  C). In the modern para-Hermitian approach to double field theory, see in
particular [6] and [7], an especially important role is played by the operators P~(X) and P (X) (in arbitrary dimensions). These operators are also crucial in the present work, and in our notation we have the equivalence:

~ A := AAA  P~(X), A := AAA  P (X).

(3.52a) (3.52b)

In particular, C~A corresponds to CP~(X), and CA corresponds to CP (X).

4 Integrable structures

4.1 Special spinor fields

The characterization given by Theorem 3.4 of the space of almost para-Hermitian structures allows immediately an explicit description of the eigenbundles: given K, there exist projective spinors A, A such that eq. (3.26) (or (3.29) in the Riemmanian case) holds,
and from this expression one can readily check that the ±1 eigenbundles are respectively

L = {ua  T M  C | ua = AA, A  S(0, -1; -w1)}, L~ = {va  T M  C | va = AµA, µA  S(-1, 0; -w0)},

(4.1) (4.2)

where A, A are fixed and A, µA vary, and where S(r, r; w) represents the weighted

bundles described in Appendix B. We have to include these weighted bundles because,

since A and A have non-trivial weights (see table 1), the spinors A, µA should also have non-trivial weights so that the elements of L, L~ are ordinary vectors.

As discussed in Section 2.1, the integrability properties of an almost para-Hermitian structure like (3.26) refer to whether the distributions L and L~ are involutive. In partic-

ular, according to Definition 2.10, K is half-integrable if and only if NP  0 or NP~  0,

and integrable if and only L and L~ are respectively

if

(4.3a) (4.3b)

Lemma 4.1. Consider an almost (para-)Hermitian structure on a real 4-manifold M (Def. 2.3), and let  be the Levi-Civita connection of g. For concreteness suppose that the (para-)complex structure is of negative chirality (see Remark 3.6). Then the (para)Hermitian structure is

1. half-integrable if and only if there exists a non-trivial unprimed spinor field A such

that

ABAAB = 0.

(4.4)

28

2. integrable if and only if there are two linearly independent solutions to equation (4.4).
Proof. Denote the (para-)complex structure by K, and suppose it has negative chirality. Then K can be written as (3.26) for some (projective) spinor fields A, A (where in the Riemannian case we have A = iA ). Then the projectors P, P~ take the form (4.3a)-(4.3b). Now let us compute NP (X, Y ) for arbitrary X, Y , using (4.3a)-(4.3b). We have:
(NP (X, Y ))AA = - -1AB[P X, P Y ]BA = - -1AB -1CDX DCCC (-1BE Y EA)
--1C DY DC CC(-1BE X EA)
= - -3AB(C DX DCE Y EACCB - C DY DCE X EACC B) = - -3ABC E D(X DCY EA - X DAY EC)CCB = - -3(E DXDEY EE)ABC C AB,
therefore we see that NP  0 if and only if A satisfies equation (4.4), which proves the first item. An analogous calculation applies to A, and this shows that NP~  0 iff A satisfies (4.4). Therefore, the condition NP = NP~  0 is equivalent to the condition that both spinors A and B satisfy eq. (4.4); this proves the second item.
Not any 4-manifold admits non-trivial solutions to (4.4), so half-integrability of K imposes restrictions. We may call equation (4.4) the "shear-free condition", since in Lorentzian general relativity its solutions define what are known as shear-free null geodesic congruences: the real vector field a = A¯A is tangent to a null geodesic congruence which is shear-free (see e.g. [31, Section 9.2] for the definition of shear of a geodesic congruence). If, for example, one also asks the metric to be Einstein, then by the GoldbergSachs theorem the Weyl tensor must be algebraically special, which is a restriction on the curvature. Still, many physically interesting spacetimes in general relativity satisfy this property; in particular, stationary black hole solutions such as Kerr or Schwarzschild (with or without cosmological constant).
In the DFT language, a choice of K means a choice of T-dual `spacetimes', where the physical spacetime is related to the involutive eigenbundle. If we change K, the new K might not be half-integrable so it would not define such T-dual spaces. Requiring any K to be "appropriate" in this sense imposes more severe restrictions:
Lemma 4.2. Let M be a real, 4-dimensional, orientable manifold equipped with a metric g. If all almost-para-Hermitian structures (of a definite chirality) are half-integrable, then the Weyl curvature of g is (A)SD.
Proof. Let K be an arbitrary almost para-Hermitian structure, and assume for concreteness that it has negative chirality. Then we know that it is represented by two projective spinor fields A, A. We also know that K is half-integrable if and only if one of these spinor fields satisfies eq. (4.4). Let A denote any of these spinors. From (4.4) we deduce that AAAB = BB for some spinor field B. Applying now CCA to equation
29

(4.4), one obtains the following integrability condition:

0 = C C A (ABAAB) = 2AABAAB - C AB = - ABCDABC D

where AC = A(AC)A, and ABCD is the Weyl curvature spinor (see [25] for details). If any almost para-Hermitian structure K is half-integrable, then (4.5) must be satisfied by all spinors A, which implies that ABCD  0 and thus the Weyl curvature of g is SD. (Choosing positive chirality instead leads to ASD Weyl curvature.)

Remark 4.3. When saying that "any almost-para-Hermitian structure is half-integrable", it is convenient to be more specific and say, using the terminology mentioned in Remark 2.11, that "the manifold is L-para Hermitian with respect to any K", i.e. the (+1)eigenbundle of any K is involutive. From this perspective, if a manifold is L-para Hermitian with respect to any K, then it follows that it is para-Hermitian. To see this: let K be an arbitrary L-para Hermitian structure, i.e. its (+1)-eigenbundle is involutive. If any other K is also L-para Hermitian, then in particular this is true for K = -K. The (+1)-eigenbundle of K is then involutive, and it is the (-1)-eigenbundle of K. So K is both L-para Hermitian and L~-para Hermitian, i.e., it is para-Hermitian.

The (A)SD restriction in lemma 4.2 is quite strong. In Lorentz signature, the leftand right-handed Weyl curvature spinors are complex conjugates of each other, which implies that (A)SD Weyl curvature means vanishing Weyl tensor, so the manifold must be conformally flat. In Riemannian and split signature, the two Weyl curvature spinors are independent from each other, so one of them can vanish while the other one is general. In the Riemannian case, if one also asks Ricci-flatness (as well as (A)SD Weyl curvature), then it can be shown that the manifold must be hyperkähler.
In the DFT literature, a change of para-complex structure is referred to as a change of polarization. As mentioned, an arbitrary change of polarization in general does not lead to a new pair of T-dual `spacetimes', unless all para-complex structures are halfintegrable. Another possibility is to consider "small" changes of polarization, by which we mean deformations of the para-complex structure. These issues will be addressed in section 5, in connection also with twistor constructions.

4.2 Lie and Courant algebroids

We have seen that, given a 4-dimensional real manifold M with a metric g, any K 

Aut(T M  C) satisfying conditions (3.13) and (3.14) is characterized by two projective spinor fields [A], [A]. The tangent bundle splits as T M  C = L  L~, where L and L~ are the eigenbundles of K, given explicitly in eqs. (4.1), (4.2). Because of this splitting,

any vector in T M  C can be decomposed into two pieces, as originally done in (2.1). We can explicitly describe these pieces using (4.1), (4.2), the identity P + P~ = I and the fact that the projectors P and P~ are given by (4.3a), (4.3b). That is, any X  (T M  C) is

decomposed as

XAA = (P X)AA + (P~X)AA  xAA + x~AA,

(4.6)

30

where

(P X)AA  xAA = AxA , (P~X)AA  x~AA = Ax~A ,

xA = -1BX BA, x~A = --1BX BA .

(4.7) (4.8)

Analogous decompositions and notation apply to any other vector Y AA = yAA + y~AA, etc. Similarly, a 1-form W  (T M  C) is decomposed as

WAA = AA + ~AA = AA + A~A,

(4.9)

with

A = -1BBA, ~A = - -1BBA.

Remark 4.4. Ordinary tensor fields have trivial r, r, w weights (in the notation of Definition 3.10), but the spinors A, A have non-trivial weights (given in Table 1). Therefore,
when decomposed into pieces like (4.6) or (4.9), the primed spinor parts are also nontrivially weighted. For example, the spinors xA and x~A in the decomposition (4.7)-(4.8) have non-trivial weights, which can be deduced from those of  and A, A. This is analogous to the fact that A, µA in (4.1), (4.2) are also weighted.

We now use the above decomposition to describe the Lie and Courant algebroid structures of 4-manifolds admitting non-trivial solutions to (4.4). Since this equation involves only a conformal structure and a projective spinor field, the covariant formalism of Section 3.3 is here appropriate to give a formulation invariant under the associated gauge freedom. We recall that the metric is allowed to have any signature.

Lemma 4.5. Let (M, [gab]) be a 4-dimensional, real conformal structure. Let gab  [gab], with Levi-Civita connection AA. Suppose that there is a projective spinor field [A], where any representative A satisfies the equation

ABAAB = 0.

(4.10)

Let A be any spinor field such that ABAB   = 0. Let L  T M  C be defined by (4.1), and let CA be the operator introduced in (3.51).

1. The triple (L, [·, ·]L, P ) is a Lie algebroid, where P is the projector (4.3a), and the Lie algebroid bracket is

[X, Y ]ALA = A(xB CB yA - yBCB xA ),

(4.11)

for any vector fields X, Y  (L).

2. Let k = kL, k = 0, 1, 2, .... The Lie algebroid exterior derivative of (L, [·, ·]L, P ) is given by

(dLf )AA = -1ACA f, (dL)AABB = -1(CC C)AB AB ,

(4.12) (4.13)

and dL = 0 for any   (k) with k  2, where C in the right hand side of (4.13) refers to the decomposition (4.9).

31

3. For a 1-form   (L), the generalized Lie derivative along X  (L) is (£LX )AA = A[xA (CB B) + CA (xB B )].

(4.14)

Proof. For the first item, we need to check that the conditions in Definition 2.17 are

satisfied. First of all, we know that L is a vector bundle over M. We have also seen that

the condition (4.10) implies that sections of L are in involution with respect to the usual

Lie bracket [·, ·] of vector fields, thus its restriction to L, [·, ·]L, indeed maps (L) × (L) to (L), is skew-symmetric and satisfies the Jacobi identity. In addition, the identity in

T M restricted to L coincides with P , and it satisfies the conditions to be an anchor. So

it only remains to prove the expression (4.11) for the Lie algebroid bracket. To do this,

notice first that, since ordinary vector fields X, Y have trivial w, r, r weights (see Remark

4.4), we have for example

CbXa = bXa + QbcaXc,

where Qbca was defined in (2.27). Since Qbca = Q(bc)a, we get

XbbY a - Y bbXa = XbCbY a - Y bCbXa.

Using this and decompositions like (4.6)-(4.7)-(4.8) for X, Y  (L), we have:

[X, Y ]ALA = X BB BB Y AA - Y BB BB X AA = xB BCBB (AyA) - yBBCBB (AxA ) = A(xB CB yA - yB CB xA )

where in the third line we used (B.11c) and (4.10), together with the definition (3.51) for CA .
Now let us prove the second item. From Definition 2.20, the Lie algebroid exterior derivative acting on a 0-form f  (0) is given by (dLf )(X) = P (X)(f ) (since here the anchor is the projector P ). Since f has trivial weights, we can replace the ordinary AA implicit in this formula by the covariant derivative CAA, so we get
(dLf )(X) = (P X)AACAAf.

Using (4.7), formula (4.12) follows. Consider now a 1-form   (1). The operator dL acting on  is given by the expression (2.15), with   P . Since , X, Y have trivial weights we can, as before, replace AA by CAA:
(dL)(X, Y ) = (P X)AACAA(BB Y BB ) - (P Y )AACAA(BB XBB ) - AA[X, Y ]ALA.

Replacing the expressions for X, Y and [X, Y ]L, this is

(dL)(X, Y ) = xB CB (AyA) - yBCB (AxA ) - A(xB CB yA - yBCB xA )

=  xB CB (A yA) - yB CB (A xA ) - A xB CB yA + A yB CB xA

= (xA yB - yA xB )CA B

(4.15)

32

where in the second line we used (B.11d). Now:

xA yB - yAxB = (CD xC yD)AB = (CD -2C X CC DY DD )AB = (-2C DCD AB )X CC Y DD
where in the second line we replaced the expression (4.7) for xA, and similarly for yA. Replacing now in (4.15), and noticing that

(dL)(X, Y ) = (dL)CCDDXCCY DD ,
formula (4.13) follows. If now   (k), k  2, then dL vanishes since it is a (k+1)-form with k  2 in a 2-dimensional space.
Finally, to show the third item, from the general expression (2.13) we have

(£LX )AA = X BB (dL)BBAA + [dL(X BB BB )]AA . Using the second item, this is

(£LX )AA = X BB -1B ABA CC C + -1ACA (xB B ) = AxACC C + ACA(xB B ),

which proves (4.14).

Lemma 4.6. Let (M, [gab]) be a 4-dimensional, real conformal structure. Let gab  [gab], with Levi-Civita connection AA. Suppose that there is a projective spinor field [A], where any representative A satisfies the equation

ABAAB = 0.

(4.16)

Let A be any spinor field such that ABAB =  = 0. Then the quadruple

(T M  C, g, P, ·, · )

(4.17)

is a Courant algebroid, where the anchor P and the Dorfman bracket are respectively

P AA BB

=

-1AB A B ,

(4.18)

X, Y AA = A(xB CB yA - yBCB xA ) + A xACB y~B - yACB x~B + CA(xB y~B )

(4.19)

with CA the operator defined in (3.51).
Proof. Define the bundle L  T M  C by (4.1); then from Lemma 4.5, the triple (L, [·, ·]L, P ) is a Lie algebroid. Thus, applying Proposition 2.24, the vector bundle L  L together with the maps defined by (2.18), (2.19) and (2.20), constitute a Courant algebroid. Using now the pair of spinors (A, A) to define, via (3.26), a tensor field K satisfying conditions (3.13) and (3.14), the eigenbundles of K are given by (4.1) and (4.2) and we have the splitting T M  C = L  L~. We can then apply Proposition 2.25, so the

33

quadruple (4.17) is also a Courant algebroid. The anchor is simply the projector (4.3a). What remains now is to translate the expression (2.24) for the Dorfman bracket to the language we are using in this section. Using (4.7), (4.8), (4.12) and (4.14), we have

(x~)AA = ABAB x~BB = Ax~A , (y~)AA = ABAB y~BB = Ay~A, g(x~, y) = ABAB x~AA yBB = x~AyA, (dLg(x~, y))AA = ACA(x~B yB), [£Lx (y~)]AA = A[xA CB y~B + CA (xB y~B )].

(4.20) (4.21) (4.22) (4.23) (4.24)

The Dorfman bracket (2.24) is

X, Y AA = [x, y]AA + (£Lx (y~) - £Ly (x~) + dLg(x~, y))AA.

Since x, y are sections of L, we have [x, y]AA = [x, y]ALA, so we can use formula (4.11). Replacing also (4.23), (4.24), we get

X, Y AA = A(xB CB yA - yBCB xA ) + A[xA CB y~B + CA(xB y~B)] - A[yACB x~B + CA(yB x~B )] + ACA(x~B yB)
= A(xB CB yA - yB CB xA ) + A xA CB y~B - yA CB x~B + CA (xB y~B )

which is (4.19).
Recall from Remark 2.21 that a Lie algebroid has naturally associated a cochain complex ((·), dL). In our case this is

0  (0) -dL (1) -dL (2)  0.

(4.25)

We can think of this as a (twisted) de Rham complex. Since a twisted de Rham complex is locally exact, if an object  satisfies dL = 0, then there exists, locally13, another field  such that  = dL. Therefore, the Lie algebroid structure leads to a "potentialization" scheme. For example, suppose WAA = AA  (1) satisfies dLW = 0, then there exists f  (0) such that W = dLf . Using (4.12)-(4.13), the equation dLW = 0 is CAA = 0, and the equation W = dLf is WAA = -1ACAf . In other words:

CAA = 0  A = -1CAf

(4.26)

for some f . Such a basic `potentialization' scheme turns out to be very powerful when applied to problems of interest in relativity (this will be the subject of a separate work). Notice, however, that the weights of the potentials here are restricted by the fact that the spaces (k) in the complex (4.25) are composed of objects with zero weights. If we want to study whether the complex (4.25) can be generalized to fields with other weights, we are led to the question of constructing Lie algebroids for weighted fields. This turns out to be a bit tricky, and will be analysed in the next subsection.

13Of course, global existence of potentials is a different story, where one has to take into account the cohomology of the complex (4.25).

34

4.3 Weighted algebroids

The algebroids constructed in lemmas 4.5 and 4.6 consist of vectors with trivial weights
(in the sense of def. 3.10). From the discussion at the end of the previous subsection, we
are also interested in analysing whether spaces of non-trivially weighted objects can be
given an algebroid structure. We will see here that ordinary Lie algebroids do not seem
to be compatible with weighted fields. Let L be the bundle (4.1), where A satisfies (4.4). Consider the weighted vector
bundle L(r,r;w) := L  S(r, r; w), where S(r, r; w) is the line bundle defined in (B.4). An element of L(r,r;w) is a vector with weights (r, r; w) (so L is simply L(0,0;0)):

X  L(r,r;w)  Xa = AxA and X -Go rµrwX.

L(r,r;w) is a vector bundle over M . In order to construct a Lie algebroid, we also need an anchor and a Lie bracket satisfying the conditions given in Def. 2.17.
Let us first focus on the bracket. Given two weighted vector fields X  (L(r1,r1 ;w1)), Y  (L(r2,r2 ;w2)), we have a natural candidate for a bracket operation:

[X, Y ]aC := XbCbY a - Y bCbXa.

(4.27)

This is skew-symmetric, and, since Ca satisfies (3.50) and CbA = 0, the result of [X, Y ]aC is again a vector of the form AA with well-defined weights. However, the first problem
that arises is that the weights of [X, Y ]aC are (r1 + r2, r1 + r2 ; w1 + w2), so [X, Y ]aC is neither an element of L(r1,r1 ;w1) nor of L , (r2,r2 ;w2) and consequently, we cannot use [·, ·]C as a Lie bracket for a particular L(r,r;w). More precisely, what we have is

[·, ·]C : (L(r1,r1 ;w1)) × (L(r2,r2 ;w2))  (L(r1+r2,r1 +r2 ;w1+w2)). This suggests that we consider the vector bundle with graded fibers

(4.28)

L=

L(r,r;w),

(r,r ;w)

(4.29)

where the sum runs over all possible values of (r, r; w). We then have [·, ·]C : (L)×(L)  (L). So the first item in Def. 2.17 is satisfied, and we can try to give a Lie algebroid structure to L.
The second item in Def. 2.17 requires the Jacobi identity for [·, ·]C to hold. Since Cb cannot be replaced by b in (4.27) (because X and Y now have non-trivial weights), whether or not the Jacobi identity for [·, ·]C is satisfied is a non-trivial issue. To investigate this, we use the Jacobiator:

JacC(X, Y, Z) := [X, [Y, Z]C]C + [Z, [X, Y ]C]C + [Y, [Z, X]C]C.

(4.30)

The following result shows that in order for this to vanish, we also need to require (half)algebraic speciality of the Weyl curvature:

Lemma 4.7. Suppose that the spinor field A is shear-free. Then the Jacobiator (4.30) vanishes if and only if A is a repeated principal spinor of the ASD Weyl curvature.

35

Proof. Take three arbitrary vector fields in (L) (with possibly different weights), Xa = AxA, Y a = AyA, Za = AzA. A tedious but straightforward calculation shows that

(JacC(X, Y, Z))AA = A[(xC yC)(CB CB zA )-(xC zC )(CB CB yA)+(yCzC )(CB CB xA )].

Therefore, the Jacobi identity for [·, ·]C is satisfied if and only if CACA = 0

(4.31)

when acting on any weighted primed spinor field. This equation is investigated in Appendix C, where the proof of Lemma C.5 shows that equation (4.31) is satisfied if and only if ABCDBCD = 0, i.e., A is a repeated principal spinor of the ASD Weyl curvature.
Let us now focus on the construction of the anchor. From Def. 2.17, this should be a map  : L  T M  C. An element X  L(r,r;w)  L has non-trivial weights, so we cannot use the projector P as an anchor as before, since P X has also non-trivial weights and thus it is not an element of T M  C. Therefore, to any weighted vector X we must somehow associate a vector (X) with trivial weights. To this end, consider three scalar fields A, B, C of types (1, 0; 0), (0, 1; 0) and (0, 0; 1) respectively; that is:

A -Go A,

B -Go µB,

C -Go C.

Then we can define a map

 : L(r,r;w)  T M  C,

(X) := A-rB-rC-wX.

(4.32)

Although this is rather ad hoc since we have not specified anything about the scalars A, B, C, we restrict the possible choices of them by requiring

CA A = CA B = CAC = 0

(4.33)

where as before CA = ACAA. In Lemma C.5 it is shown that, if A is shear-free and a repeated principal spinor, the integrability condition CACA = 0 is satisfied for any weighted scalar field , so there are indeed solutions to (4.33). With the choice (4.33), if
X  (L(r1,r1 ;w1)), Y  (L(r2,r2 ;w2)), we have

([X, Y ]C)a = A-(r1+r2)B-(r1 +r2 )C-(w1+w2)[X, Y ]aC = A-(r1+r2)B-(r1 +r2 )C-(w1+w2)(X bCbY a - Y bCbX a) = A-r1 B-r1 C-w1 X bCb(A-r2 B-r2 C-w2 Y a) - A-r2 B-r2 C-w2 Y bCb(A-r1 B-r1 C-w1 X a) = (X)bCb((Y )a) - (Y )bCb((X)a) = [(X), (Y )]a

where in the third line we used (4.33), in the fourth we used the definition (4.32), and in the fifth the fact that (X), (Y ) have trivial weights. Therefore, we see that with the choice of the anchor (4.32)-(4.33) and the bracket (4.27), the map (4.32) is a morphism and the third item in the definition 2.17 of a Lie algebroid is satisfied.

36

The last condition that we need to investigate is the fourth item in Def. 2.17, namely the Leibniz rule for the bracket and the anchor:

[X, f Y ]C =? ((X)f )Y + f [X, Y ]C

(4.34)

for any X  (L(r1,r1 ;w1)), Y  (L(r2,r2 ;w2)) and f  C(M ). However, the gradation (4.28) of the bracket implies immediately that we cannot expect this condition to be

satisfied: If f  C(M ) is an ordinary function, then f Y  (L(r2,r2 ;w2)), so, because of (4.28), the left hand side of (4.34) is an element of (L(r1+r2,r1 +r2;w1+w2)); but in the right hand side, while the second term is in this space as well, the first term lives in (L(r2,r2 ;w2)), so eq. (4.34) is generally inconsistent. (There is the possibility however of taking   0,

but this is not something that we wish to consider here; see (4.35) below.) In other words,

asking the condition (4.34) to hold is incompatible with the gradation (assuming  = 0).

The structure we appear to need is then some sort of "graded Lie algebroid" (if such a

thing can be defined at all). Here we simply observe that computation of the left hand

side of (4.34) gives

[X, f Y ]C = X(f ) Y + f [X, Y ]C,

(4.35)

which is the Leibniz rule satisfied by the ordinary Lie bracket of vector fields. In conclusion, the triple (L, , [·, ·]C), where L,  and [·, ·]C are defined respectively by
(4.29), (4.32)-(4.33) and (4.27), satisfies the conditions to be a Lie algebroid except for the Leibniz rule (4.34), which must be replaced by the ordinary Leibniz rule (4.35). More precisely, the Leibniz rule (4.34) cannot be compatible with the gradation of a vector bundle (when  = 0), so it seems that one would need to find an appropriate modification of it in order to accommodate a situation with graded fibers.
Another possibility is to introduce a notion of "weighted algebroids", by simply replacing the tangent bundle in the original definition 2.17 by the weighted tangent bundle T M(Cr,r;w) = T M  C  S(r, r; w). The bracket (4.27) is also defined for any section of T M(Cr,r;w), so the ordinary Lie bracket of the tangent bundle could be replaced by (4.27). A "weighted Lie algebroid" would then be given by definition 2.17 and its four items, but using T M(Cr,r;w) instead of the tangent bundle. Then, by simply taking the inclusion map L(r,r;w)  T M(Cr,r;w) as "anchor" (in other words,  = P again), the triple (L, P, [·, ·]C) is a "weighted Lie algebroid" in the above sense.
The above definition is completely ad hoc, and it is not clear if one gains anything at all by introducing such a structure, apart from perhaps adapting the Lie algebroid definition to a situation with graded fibers in this particular case. However, our motivation for analysing this issue was, as mentioned at the end subsection 4.2, to see if the differential complex (4.25) can be generalized to objects with arbitrary weights. The fact that (4.25) is indeed a differential complex is a consequence of: (i) the morphism property of the anchor, and (ii) the vanishing Jacobiator for the Lie algebroid bracket. If we now take the inclusion L(r,r;w)  T M(Cr,r;w) as anchor, then it is trivially a morphism, and the Jacobiator for the bracket (4.27) has been investigated in Lemma 4.7. Therefore, it still makes sense to try to construct an analogue of the complex (4.25). To this end, we first introduce weighted differential forms as sections of the space14 k(r,r;w) := (kL)  S(r, r; w), and we define

14Note that k(r,r;w) = k(L  S(r, r; w)).

37

the "weighted Lie algebroid differential",

dL : (k(r,r;w))  (k(r+,r1;w)),

(4.36)

by its action on weighted 0- and 1-forms, in close analogy to (2.14)-(2.15):

(dLf )(X) := CX f, (dL)(X, Y ) := CX (Y ) - CY (X) - ([X, Y ]C).

(4.37) (4.38)

Explicitly, these expressions are formally equal to the right hand sides of (4.12)-(4.13), but now f and  are allowed to have arbitrary weights. We have:
Lemma 4.8. Suppose that A is shear-free. Then the following sequence is a differential complex if and only if A is also a repeated principal spinor of the ASD Weyl curvature15:

0  (0(r,r;w)) -dL (1(r,r;w)) -dL (2(r,r;w))  0.

(4.39)

Proof. We have to check dL  dL = 0. We only have to see this for (weighted) 0-forms, since for a 1-form , dLdL is a 3-form in a 2-dimensional space and thus it vanishes automatically. Consider an arbitrary weighted scalar f  (0(r,r;w)), and two arbitrary weighted vectors Xa = AxA, Y a = AyA, then, using (4.37), (4.38):

(dLdLf )(X, Y ) = CX CY f - CY CX f - C[X,Y ]Cf = XaY b(CaCb - CbCa)f = xA yBAB[Ca, Cb]f = xB yB CA CA f

where in the fourth line we used (C.8). Therefore, dLdLf = 0 if and only if CACAf = 0, which, because of Lemma C.5, is equivalent to requiring A to be a repeated principal spinor.
Therefore, we see that as long as A is shear-free and a repeated principal spinor, the "potentialization" (4.26) is also valid for fields with arbitrary weights.

Remark 4.9. If we are only interested in a particular metric gab, i.e. not in a conformal
structure, then instead of CAA we can use the so-called "GHP" covariant derivative AA (which consists of only some parts of CAA) and its projections A, ~ A. One can show that if A is shear-free and a repeated principal spinor, then A = AAA also satisfies AA = 0 (on scalars and primed spinor fields), so we again have a "potentialization"
scheme for A. This is particularly useful for analysing integrability of the Einstein
equations.

Remark 4.10. Although the Leibniz rule is not included in the definition 2.22 of a Courant algebroid, we saw in eq. (2.16) that it is actually a consequence of the axioms; thus, the vector bundle L cannot give an ordinary Courant algebroid structure either.
15A similar complex was obtained in [20], but not in the context of Lie algebroids.

5 Twistors

The twistor programme was introduced by Roger Penrose and it describes a non-local

correspondence between spacetime and another space called twistor space. In this section

we describe some natural relations between the constructions we have seen so far and

twistor theory. We first give the basic definition of a twistor, then we elaborate in sections

5.1 and 5.2 on the relation between the integrable structures studied in previous sections

and twistor spaces.

According to Penrose, the basic premise in twistor theory is that light rays are to

be regarded as more basic entities than spacetime events (see e.g. [26, Section 6.1]).

Consider real, 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime M, and a point with coordinates xAo A (with respect to an arbitrary origin). A light ray  through this point is described by the

null geodesic

xAA ( ) =  A¯A + xAo A ,

(5.1)

where  is a real parameter, and we are using that the vector field pAA tangent to the geodesic is null, so it can be expressed as pAA  A¯A for some spinor field A.

Contraction with A shows that xAA( )A = xAo AA for all  . Since this is true for all  , the contraction defines a spinor µA by

xAA A  iµA

(5.2)

where xAA denotes any point in , and the factor i is here introduced only to follow

standard twistor conventions. The entire light ray  is then in principle represented by

the pair of spinors (A, µA). However, the same  is obtained if we multiply A and µA by a non-zero complex number. Thus,  can be represented as a point in (C2  C¯ 2)/ , where  refers to the equivalence relation just mentioned. The space PT := (C2 C¯ 2)/ 

is called (projective) twistor space (we see that it is isomorphic to the complex projective
3-space CP3 16). Actually, real light rays lie in a submanifold of PT, since for real xAA one has the constraint µA¯A + µ¯AA = 0, as follows from (5.2). On the other hand, given a point (A, µA) in twistor space PT, what does this correspond to in spacetime? The answer is the set of xAA such that (5.2) holds. If µA¯A + µ¯AA = 0, (5.2) has no real solutions for xAA, so one needs to complexify spacetime in order to have solutions. In the

complexified spacetime CM, suppose that yAA is a solution to (5.2), i.e. yAAA = iµA, then we see that xAA = AA + yAA is also a solution for any spinor A. Thus the set of

points in CM satisfying (5.2) is a 2-dimensional (complex) plane . For any two points

x, y in   CM we have xAA - yAA = AA for some A, thus vectors tangents to 

are of the form AA where A is fixed and A varies. This implies that any tangent to

 is null, and likewise the inner product between any two tangent vectors vanishes. In

other words,

|T   0

(5.3)

where T  is the tangent bundle to  and  is the Minkowski metric. Twistor space PT is then the moduli space of the 2-surfaces  in which (5.3) holds.
The above construction of twistor space starts from the explicit expression (5.1) for light rays (null geodesics) in flat spacetime (which leads to the fundamental relation (5.2)),

16Twistor space is actually CP3\CP1 (see e.g. [36, 34]), but we do not need to make this distinction for our elementary presentation.

39

thus it does not apply to curved spacetimes. For the curved case one has to generalize (5.3). We allow also different signatures for the metric:

Definition 5.1. Let M be a (possibly complex) 4-dimensional manifold equipped with a metric g. A twistor surface (or simply twistor) in M is a totally null 2-surface: a 2-dimensional surface  in which the induced metric vanishes identically,

g|T   0

(5.4)

where T  is the tangent bundle to . We define twistor space as the moduli space of the 2-surfaces (5.4).

In flat spacetime one can also define twistors via solutions to the twistor equation (see [26]), but in general curved spacetimes this equation has no solutions so the definition via (5.4) is slightly more general, see [35, 36, 34]. The existence of twistor surfaces is however still quite restrictive; in particular, the usual twistor space of twistor theory is 3-dimensional and it requires the Weyl curvature to be (anti-)self-dual.
Having introduced these basic concepts, we can now describe the connection of these ideas with the structures studied in previous sections. We notice first that, from the basic definition (5.4) (or (5.3)) of a twistor, we see that it coincides with the Lagrangian submanifolds considered in double field theory, eq. (1.1) (but the motivation here is completely different, as we just saw).

Remark 5.2. Since here we are interested in twistors, which are generally complex surfaces, in this section we assume the manifold to be real-analytic, so that it admits a complexification, which will be denoted by CM.

5.1 Two-dimensional twistor spaces
An immediate connection between twistors and the para-Hermitian structures considered in this work is as follows: A half-integrable (para-)Hermitian structure in four dimensions defines a two-dimensional twistor space.
To see this, consider an almost-para Hermitian structure (g, K) on a 4-manifold M, which produces a splitting T M C = LL~, where L and L~ are both 2-dimensional. If the structure is half-integrable, then the distribution L (say) is involutive. Then the integral manifolds associated to L are 2-surfaces  such that T  = L|. Now, the para-Hermitian property implies, as we know, that g|T  = 0, therefore the integral manifolds (i.e. leaves)  are twistor surfaces. Furthermore, the space of leaves is two-dimensional, thus we have, according to definition 5.1, a two-dimensional twistor space. Notice that this is true for any signature.
If the almost-para Hermitian structure is moreover integrable, i.e. the two eigenbundles L and L~ are involutive, then there are two different sets of twistor surfaces, i.e. two different two-dimensional twistor spaces. (In the next subsection we will analyse possible ways of understanding these spaces in relation to the usual three-dimensional space of twistor theory.) Note that each involutive eigenbundle defines a pair of (possibly complex) coordinates, zi = (z1, z2) and z~i = (z~1, z~2), which give in particular a basis for

40

the cotangent bundle, T M  C = span(dzi, dz~i). Furthermore, the fact that the metric satisfies g(K·, K·) = -g(·, ·) implies that it can be written in this basis as

g

=

gij dzi



dz~j

+

g

i j

dz~i



dzj .

(5.5)

According to the DFT interpretation, the interchange of the foliations zi = const. and z~i = const. is understood as a T-duality transformation.
If only one of the distributions L, L~ is integrable, it is worth mentioning that, apart from the above interpretation in terms of the twistor programme, (complex) 4-manifolds admitting a foliation by the associated twistor surfaces have been extensively studied by Plebaski and collaborators, who called these surfaces null strings, and the manifolds admitting them HH- or hyper-heavenly spaces; the name originates in the fact that they are a `generalization' of the H-spaces, or heavens, introduced by Newman17. Remarkably, Plebaski and Robinson showed in [21] that the existence of such integral submanifolds is sufficient for reducing the full non-linear Einstein vacuum equations to a scalar, secondorder, non-linear PDE known as `hyper-heavenly equation'.
A 2-dimensional twistor space like the one above has been considered in [20] in relation to problems in perturbation theory in relativity. It is interesting to analyse how this 2dimensional twistor space is related to the usual 3-dimensional space of twistor theory; we will do this next.

5.2 Three-dimensional twistor spaces
In this section we will show the following: If all almost-para Hermitian structures are half-integrable, then there exists a three-dimensional (3D) twistor space PT, which is a mono-parametric family of two-dimensional (2D) twistor spaces parametrized by projective spinor fields. This family is not necessarily a fibration over projective spinors: it is a fibration iff the vacuum Einstein equations hold.
Our discussion will be valid for any signature (also for complex manifolds). We will generically denote the space of projective spinors (at a point) as P1, that is P1 = CP1 in Riemannian and Lorentz signature (and in complex manifolds), and P1 = RP1 in split signature.
We will first see how to get from a 2D twistor space to a 3D one, then we will discuss the fibration structure. First, recall from Remark 4.3 that, if any K is half-integrable, then any K is actually integrable. Now let K be an arbitrary integrable para-Hermitian structure. From Section 3.2 we know that it is represented by two projective spinor fields, say A and A, in the form (3.26), where (since K is integrable) both fields satisfy (4.4). Any other para-Hermitian structure K is represented by two other projective spinor fields A and A in the same way, and, since spin-space is 2-dimensional, at any point these spinors can be expressed as linear combinations of A and A, say A = aA + bA and
17This `generalization' is in the sense that while an H-space is a Ricci-flat, complex 4-manifold with self-dual curvature, an HH-space was originally defined as a Ricci-flat, complex 4-manifold with (half) algebraically special curvature. But the definition of Newman's H-space is more subtle than this simple characterization in the sense that it is, by construction, associated to general, asymptotically flat spacetimes (with real-analytic null infinity), via solutions to the good-cut equation. See also section 5.2.1.

41

A = cA + dA. But since A and A should really be thought of as projective spinor fields, the scaling is irrelevant, so we can take A = A + 1A and A = A + 2A for some 1, 2. This means that the principal spinor fields of any para-Hermitian structure can be reached by different values of  in

A() := A + A.

(5.6)

Note that A corresponds to  = 0 whereas A corresponds to  = . At any fixed point of M, one can think of  as a stereographic coordinate on the Riemann sphere P1 = C  {} (for Riemannian and Lorentz signature) or on the circle P1 = R  {} (for split signature).
For any fixed , A() is a principal spinor field of an integrable para-Hermitian structure, thus, from section 5.1, it defines a 2D twistor space. Therefore, varying  we add one more dimension and we get a three-dimensional twistor space: equivalently, a mono-parametric family of 2D twistor spaces. We denote the 3D twistor space as PT. Since varying  means varying A(), the family is parametrized by projective spinor fields.
Notice that in Riemannian and Lorentz signature, twistor surfaces are necessarily complex, and the twistor space PT is complex. Twistor surfaces live in the complexification CM, and at each point of CM there is a 2-sphere CP1 worth of them. In terms of M, what we have is a 2-sphere bundle of twistor planes, where a twistor plane is the tangent space to a twistor surface. In split signature, we can restrict to real twistor surfaces, and the associated twistor space PT is real. In this case, at each point of M there is a circle RP1 worth of twistor surfaces; i.e. we have a circle bundle of twistor planes over M. For the connection of these twistor spaces with other twistor constructions in the literature, see section 5.2.1 below.

Remark 5.3. From the constructions seen in section 4, it follows that if any almost-para Hermitian structure is half-integrable, then there is a one-parameter family of Lie and Courant algebroids for the tangent bundle, where each algebroid structure is defined by a projective spinor field.

Let us now discuss the possible fibration structure of PT. What we will argue is that the family of 2D twistor spaces is fibered over projective spinors if and only if the Einstein vacuum equations are satisfied18. Essentially, the obstruction for a fibration is that, given an arbitrary integrable para-Hermitian structure K, defined by two projective spinor fields [A], [A], we can achieve

BBB A = 0,

BBB A = 0

(5.7)

but in general we have

BBB A = 0,

BBB A = 0.

(5.8)

First, recall that the assumption that any para-Hermitian structure is integrable implies that the Weyl curvature is self-dual (i.e. ABCD  0, we saw this in Lemma 4.219).
18In twistor theory, the fact that the twistor space of a Ricci-flat complex 4-manifold is fibered over CP1 is already known; see e.g. Remark (2) in p. 444 in [34].
19The restriction to self-dual curvature in relation to the existence of a 3D twistor space has of course been known in twistor theory since its origins.

42

Recall also that any representative spinor field A satisfies the shear-free condition (4.4). We can now ask a stronger condition and choose the scaling such that A is covariantly constant over any twistor surface  associated to it:

XbbA = 0 X  (T ),

(5.9)

that is, BBBA = 0. We can do this because the integrability condition for it is ABCDCBD = 0, which is satisfied since ABCD  0.
Consider two neighboring points in PT. These correspond to two twistor surfaces , 
in CM, which we take to be associated to the same congruence defined by the spinor field
A. We now use the concept of a `connecting vector' as defined by Penrose and Rindler in [26, Section 7.1], but slightly generalized to a congruence of surfaces instead of curves.
This is used by Ward and Wells in [34, Section 9.1]: a vector field v defined over  is a `connecting' vector to the nearby twistor surface  if the Lie derivative of v along vectors
tangent to  is again tangent to , i.e. £X v  (T ) for all X  (T ). Given the connecting vector v, the change in the spinor field A between the nearby twistor surfaces  and  is represented by the spinor field

A = vbbA.

(5.10)

If A = 0, the different twistor surfaces defined by the same spinor field A (i.e. the differents points in the associated 2D twistor space) cannot be associated to a same point spinor. So, there is no projection from the 2D twistor space to a point in P1, and consequently, the 3D twistor space PT is not fibered over P1.
Now, we can decompose the vector v as vb = aBB + bB B for some aB , bB. Thus,
using (5.9), equation (5.10) is equivalently

A = bB BBB A.

(5.11)

Therefore, the change in A between the different twistor surfaces of the congruence is governed by BBBA. If BBB A = 0, A changes along the congruence and thus there is no projection PT  P1. If BBB A = 0, we have vbbA = 0 for any connecting
vector and so A does not change between the different twistor surfaces of the associated
2D twistor space. All such surfaces can then be associated to the same point spinor,

i.e. to the same element of P1. So in this case there is a fibration PT  P1, where the

fibers are 2D twistor spaces. We represent this in Figure 1. In addition, note that, since

AA = 0, if we have both BBB A = 0 and BBB A = 0 then we actually have

BBA = 0. In particular this implies that [a, b]C = 0, so the Riemann curvature must be half-flat (since A was arbitrary). Since we already had ABCD = 0, the new information is

ABCD = 0 = 

(5.12)

where ABCD is the spinor analogue of the trace-free Ricci tensor, and  is proportional to the curvature scalar (see [25, Section 4.6]). Therefore, the manifold must be Ricci-flat.
Notice that in the Riemannian case, the conditions ABCD = 0 = ABCD =  imply that (M, g) is hyperkähler (see e.g. Theorem 9.3.3 in [33]).

Figure 1: 3D twistor space PT seen as a fibration of 2D twistor spaces over projective spinors P1, in the case that the Einstein vacuum equations are satisfied. In Riemannian and Lorentz signature, P1 = CP1 = S2, while in split signature P1 = RP1 = S1. If the manifold is not Ricci-flat, PT still consists of a family of 2D twistor spaces, but it is not fibered over P1. The 2D twistor spaces T and T are "T-dual" in the sense that they define two T-dual Lagrangian foliations of the manifold M.
5.2.1 Connections with other twistor constructions
Let us briefly comment on some relationships with the twistor space constructions in the literature, following mainly [35, 34, 33, 22, 24]. (We are only concerned with projective twistor space.) The original construction of twistor space was done by Penrose in [35], where it is called non-linear graviton and is specific to complex (anti-)self-dual 4-manifolds. The non-linear graviton is a 3-complex-dimensional manifold and its points are totally null surfaces in the (A)SD 4-manifold. The precise relationship between the two spaces can be encoded in a double fibration, where the correspondence space is the projective spin bundle. For real 4-manifolds, one can, according to signature, introduce different `real structures' (involutions) on the twistor space of the complex 4-manifold; but there are also other routes to construct the twistor space of a real 4-manifold.
In the Riemannian case, the reformulation of Penrose's twistor construction was done by Atiyah, Hitchin and Singer in [22]. This formulation associates a natural almostcomplex manifold to any real Riemannian 4-manifold (M, g). The basic idea is to incorporate all almost-complex structures in M into one almost-complex structure in a larger manifold; in other words, to provide the space of almost-complex structures itself with an almost-complex structure. The space of complex structures at a point is CP1 (see Remark 3.8), so over the whole manifold one gets the projective spin bundle PS. The almost-complex structure of PS is described by Ward and Wells [34, Section 9.1] as follows. Since PS has a connection, at any point p = (x, )  PS the tangent space decomposes as TpPS = TxM  TCP1. On TxM we have the complex structure J = iK defined by  = [A], with K given by (3.29), and TCP1 is the tangent space to a complex manifold so it naturally has a complex structure, say JCP1. Thus, the complex structure of TpPS is J = diag(J, JCP1). Atiyah et al. proved [22, Theorem 4.1] that J is integrable if and only

44

if the Weyl curvature of g is (A)SD. In that case, the space PS becomes a 3-dimensional complex manifold: this is the twistor space of M. It coincides with the space of twistor surfaces in the complexification of M.
Remark 5.4 (Twistor families). Suppose that 1 : PT  CP1 is the fibration by 2D twistor spaces, so that 1-1() is the 2D twistor space T. In the Riemannian setting, there is an alternative way to define a fibration of PT over CP1. Since PT is actually the projective spin bundle of the real 4-manifold M, one can think of a different projection 2 : PT = PS  CP1 where a typical fiber 2-1() is the complex 2-manifold (M, g, J), where J is the complex structure determined by  = [A] (in our terms this is J = iK, with K given by the right hand side of (3.29)), and g is Hermitian w.r.t. J. Therefore, PT can also be seen as a CP1-family of complex surfaces where the fibers are isometric as Riemannian manifolds but the complex structure changes from fiber to fiber. This is known in the literature as a twistor family. (Particularly relevant is the case in which M is a K3 surface, so that PT is a CP1-family of K3 surfaces.) The relation between the two fibrations 1, 2 : PT  CP1 can be seen by considering the complexification of M, denoted CM. An integral submanifold in CM of the involutive distribution L  T M  C = T CM is, on the one hand, a point in T = 1-1() (i.e. a twistor surface defined by  = [A]), and on the other hand, a complex surface (M, g, J) = 2-1(). In other words, a fiber of 1 is the space of leaves of the foliation of CM induced by a projective spinor , and a fiber of 2 is a leaf in this foliation. Both typical fibers are 2-dimensional complex manifolds.
In split signature, the twistor construction for ASD conformal structures was done by LeBrun and Mason in [24], and it also involves, in a way, the consideration of the space of almost-complex structures over M. In section 5.2 we restricted to real twistor planes (recall that a twistor plane is the tangent space to a twistor surface), but we can also consider complex twistor planes by simply complexifying the space of spinors, i.e. taking R2  C = C2. Then the bundle of complex twistor planes over M, which we denote by Z following [24], has fibers CP1 (the twistor planes we consider here are the -planes of [24]). The subbundle of real twistor planes is denoted by F in [24], and its fibers are RP1. Now, as we saw in Remark 3.9, the bundle of almost-complex structures over M, say H, has fibers CP1\RP1. This is the same as removing real twistor planes in Z, so it coincides with the bundle Z\F in [24]. Using that CP1\RP1 is a hyperboloid of two sheets, and identifying each sheet with a disk, we see that H consists of two connected components, say H = U+  U-, each of which is a disk bundle over M. The twistor space of M constructed in [24] is obtained essentially by giving a complex structure to the manifold-with-boundary U+  F (see [24, Theorem 7.3]), which we can see as "one half" (with a boundary attached) of the space of almost-complex structures over M. A twistor space construction involving the two halves of the hyperboloid H2 together also with the equator RP1 (in other words, the Riemann sphere CP1 = H2  RP1) can be found in [33, Section 10.5]. Here, the twistor space is obtained in a similar way to the Atiyah-HitchinSinger construction [22], i.e. by finding an involutive subbundle for T PS20; and it consists of two open sets that are separated by a 3-dimensional real boundary. This boundary is the real twistor space that we considered in section 5.2.
20Whether this actually gives a complex structure to PS in the ordinary sense is a little subtle, see [37].
45

Finally, in Lorentz signature, the Weyl curvature spinors of opposite chirality are complex conjugates of each other, so (A)SD Weyl tensor implies conformally flat curvature. Since the basic twistor construction is conformally invariant, the Lorentzian case is not very different from the Minkowski case. Regarding spaces of complex structures, we saw that any para-Hermitian structure is necessarily complex-valued, so by simply multiplying by i = -1 it can be converted into a "complex" structure. We showed that the space of such structures is CP1 × CP1 with the "diagonal" removed, which turns out to be a complex sphere CS2. The bundle of "almost-complex structures" compatible with g over M has then CS2 fibers, and since S2 = CP1, CS2 is a kind of "second complexification" of CP1 regarded as a real 2-manifold. It seems that one is then considering a situation similar to the Riemannian case (in which the corresponding bundle has fibers CP1) but where the fibers are now the complexified version. While in this case we are not aware of a twistor construction analogous to the one in other signatures, we find worth mentioning that complexified spheres are actually crucial in the construction of H-space and asymptotic twistor space (since these involve the complexification of null infinity). This suggests a different connection between Lorentzian "almost-complex structures" and twistor constructions: Since such "almost-complex structures" are complex-valued, we can just consider the bundle of "almost-complex structures" compatible with a complex metric on a genuine complex 4-manifold. As before, the fibers of this bundle are again CS2, so we have a 4-parameter family of complexified spheres. If all such "almost-complex structures" are "integrable", then ABCD = 0 (Lemma 4.2), which suggests that we may identify the complex 4-manifold of CS2's with Newman's H-space, and the CS2's with the `good cuts' of the complexified null infinity of a real, asymptotically flat (Lorentzian) spacetime21.
5.3 Deformations of the para-complex structure
We now wish to define a notion of deformations of a para-complex structure, and study the integrability of such deformations. Notice that we explicitly distinguish deformations of the para-complex structure K from deformations of the para-Hermitian structure (g, K); in the former, we only deal with a family K(t) of para-complex structures satisfying the paraHermitian condition with respect to some fixed metric g, while in the latter, one should consider families of both para-complex structures K(t) and metrics g(t). For the definition of deformations, we will follow [2, Chapter 5] and [38, Chapter 6]. The setting in these works is however slightly different than ours in the sense that they consider deformations of complex structures, where the eigenbundles are complex conjugates, whereas in our case they are independent since we consider para-complex structures (or even complex-valued maps). Our definition will agree with that of [7].
In the following we leave the dimension unspecified; we particularize to four dimensions after this discussion. Let (g, K) be an almost-para Hermitian structure on a d-manifold M, and let T M C = LL~ be the splitting induced by K. We consider a continuous, smooth family K(t) = Kt of para-complex structures, with K0 = K and g(Kt·, Kt·) = -g(·, ·) for all t. Then for each t we have a splitting T M  C = Lt  L~t into the eigenbundles of Kt. For small t, an element of Lt can be described as x + Btx where x  L, Btx  L~,
21H-space is also Ricci-flat, so presumably we would need to add some additional condition in order to make this suggestion more precise.
46

and the deformation has been encoded in Bt, which from the above we deduce is a map Bt : L  L~. Since Lt must be isotropic, we must have g(x + Btx, y + Bty) = 0 for all

x, y  L, which translates into g(x, Bty) + g(Btx, y) = 0, that is, Bt is skew-symmetric and can be thought of as an element of 2L. Analogously, the deformation of L~ is

described by a skew-symmetric map B~t : L~  L, i.e. an element of 2L. For the case of Hermitian structures, one has B~t = B¯t since the eigenbundles are complex conjugates; but for para-Hermitian (or complex-valued) structures the maps B~t and Bt are independent. The small deformation is then described by an endomorphism At : L  L~  L  L~ whose

matrix representation is

At =

IL Bt

B~t IL~

.

Thus we see that the deformation is given by (one half of) the sum of the B- and transformations in (2.11), with parameters B = 2Bt and  = 2B~t, and according to the
interpretation mentioned in Remark 2.16, it represents a simultaneous shearing in the directions of L and L~. Provided At is invertible, the deformed para-complex structure is Kt = AtKA-t 1. Now, we are interested in the case where the original para-Hermitian structure is half-integrable, which means that (say) the eigenbundle L is involutive while L~ is not. Since we want to study integrable deformations, we will focus on deformations of only L, that is, we set B~t = 0. Then the deformation corresponds to a B-transformation (2.11), and noticing that (in the splitting L  L~) K = diag(IL, -IL~), the deformed (para)Hermitian structure Kt = AtKA-t 1 is

Kt =

IL 2Bt

0 -IL~

.

(5.13)

This coincides with the definition given in [7]. For the calculations below, we will need

some more details about this matrix representation. Let EI = (ei, e~i) be a basis for

L  L~, with ei and e~i bases for L and L~ respectively. Any vector X  L  L~ can then be

decomposed as X = xiei + x~ie~i. Let The map Kt  Aut(L  L~) can be

F I = (i, ~j) expanded as

be the Kt =

dual basis, so (Kt)I J EI  F

that F J , and

I (EJ ) = JI . the matrix

representation (5.13) means that

Kt = ei  i - e~i  ~i + 2(Bt)ije~i  j.

(5.14)

Remark 5.5. In four dimensions, we have seen that half-integrability of K is equivalent to the fact that one of the spinor fields representing K is shear-free. Therefore, the result that deformations of K are encoded in B-transformations is somewhat natural, since, as mentioned in Remark 2.16, B-transformations in generalized geometry are interpreted as a shearing.

Now let us restrict to d = 4 dimensions. Suppose that A and A are the spinor fields

representing K, eq. (3.26). the primed spin bundle S.

Let We

µiA = (µ0A , µ1A ) have AB µ0A µ1B

a=ndN~iA=

= 0

(0A, 1A) be two bases for and AB 0A 1B = N = 0.

From these relations one can deduce22

ij µiA µjB = N~ AB , µiAµjA = N~ ii,

AB µiA µjB = N~ ij , µiA µiB = N~ A B ,

22Here, ij is defined by ij = -ji (i, j = 0, 1) and 01 = 1.

47

where µjB  ABijµiA, and similarly for iA. (Indices i, j are raised and lowered with ij and ij, analogously to A, B.) Using these identities and F I(EJ ) = JI , we deduce the following expressions for the frames and their duals:

ei = AiA AA , i = (N )-1AAi  dxAA ,

e~i = AµiAAA , ~i = -(N~ )-1AµiAdxAA

where we recall that  = AA. It then follows that Bt is given by

Bt = (Bt)ij e~i  j = (N )-1(Bt)ij ABµiABj  AA  dxBB

Using now that (Bt)ab = gac(Bt)cb is skew-symmetric, we get

(Bt)ab = --1ABAB ,

From

(5.3)

we get (Bt)ab = -1ABAB, thus, the deformed para-complex structure (5.14) is

(Kt)ab = Kab + 2(Bt)ab = -1(AB + AB)A B + 2-1ABAB = (C C)-1(AB + AB)AB ,

(5.15)

where we introduced

A := A + A.

(5.16)

Note that t is the parameter of the continuous family Kt, while  is a (possibly complex) scalar field on the manifold. The eigenbundles of Kt are analogous to (4.1)-(4.2):

Lt = {ua  T M  C | ua = AA, A  S(0, -1; -w1)}, L~t = {va  T M  C | va = AµA, µA  S(-1, 0; -w0)}.

(5.17) (5.18)

We see that the bundle L~ is not modified since L~t = L~, whereas L is deformed to Lt by using A instead of A.
Half-integrability of the deformation Kt refers to the involutivity properties of Lt. Such conditions were given in Lemma 4.1, where we saw that one has to study equation (4.4).
Therefore, the spinor field (5.16) codifies the integrability properties of the deformation
(5.14). We first prove the following identity:

Proposition 5.6. Let A, A be arbitrary spinor fields with AA =  = 0, let CAA be the associated covariant derivative (Def. 3.11) and let CA, C~A be the projections (3.51). Let A be given by (5.16), where  is an arbitrary (possibly complex) scalar field. Then we have the identity

ABAA B

(A B AA B )3.

(5.19)

Proof. We first check that AA can be replaced by CAA in the left hand side of (5.19). Note that the weights of B are the same as those of B, so using Table 1 and formula (B.10) we have

CAAB = AAB - fABA + ((w1 + 1)fAA + MAA )B,

48

thus, contracting with AB, we get ABAA B = AB CAA B.
Now,

CAAB = CAAB + BCAA + CAAB = -2AB(CDCAD) + BCAA + -2AB(C DCA D)
where in the second line we used identities (B.11b) and (B.11c). Contracting now with AB and using AA = - and AA = , we get
ABCAAB = ABAAB + CA + C~A + (ABAA B)3
therefore (5.19) follows.

Theorem 5.7. Let (g, K) be a half-integrable para-Hermitian structure (Def. 2.10) on
a 4-manifold M, and let A, A be the spinor fields representing K, where A satisfies (4.4). Let Kt be a small deformation of the para-complex structure K, represented by the scalar field  as in (5.15), (5.16). Then the eigenbundle Lt is involutive (i.e. Kt is a half-integrable deformation) if and only if

CA  = 0.

(5.20)

Proof. From Lemma 4.1 and its proof we know that involutivity of Lt is equivalent to NPt  0, which in turn is true if and only if A satisfies equation (4.4). The left hand side of (4.4) has been computed for A in (5.19). Since A satisfies (4.4) by assumption, and "small" deformation means that we only keep terms linear in , the result (5.20)
follows.

Remark 5.8. Equation (5.20) has non-trivial integrability conditions: applying CA, we get CACA = 0. Using the first equation in (C.15), we have

CA CA = (ABAABA )
where a is given by (C.2) with r, r, w the weights of . These weights can be deduced from (5.16): w() = w1 - w0, r() = -1, r() = +1. Replacing these values in identity (C.28):
CA CA = 4-1ABCDABC D .
Therefore, if  = 0 satisfies (5.20), then we must have ABCDABCD = 0, or equivalently ABCDBCD = 0 (since A satisfies (4.5)). This means that in order for integrable deformations to exist, the Weyl tensor must be (half ) algebraically special.

We end this section with a few remarks.

First, notice that in view of (4.37) (see also (4.12)), we can write (5.20) equivalently

as

dL = 0

(5.21)

where dL is the weighted Lie algebroid exterior derivative (4.36). Taking into account the fact that  is a scalar field, we can interpret this as a Maurer-Cartan equation (since

Figure 2: Illustration of small deformations of a para-complex structure in M in terms of 2D twistor spaces. A principal spinor field A of a half-integrable para-complex structure K defines a 2D twistor space T (thick vertical straight line). The dashed horizontal lines represent a line bundle L over T. A section of L (vertical curved line) corresponds to a scalar field  on M such that CA = 0. It represents a small half-integrable deformation of K, so it defines a 2D twistor space T. Integrability conditions imply that the Weyl tensor must be half-algebraically special.
the commutator term in the usual Maurer-Cartan eq. vanishes because  is a scalar). The reason for interpreting (5.21) in such a way is that it fits with the usual theory of integrable deformations of complex structures (see e.g. [38, Chapter 6]).
Second, recall from section 5.1 that a half-integrable para-Hermitian structure defines a 2D twistor space, say T. In [20], functions  satisfying (5.20) were interpreted as defining sections of line bundles over T. Here we see that (5.20) appear as integrability conditions for deformations of a para-complex structure in M. We can attempt a more or less "intuitive" understanding of this by considering a picture similar to figure 1, in which 2D twistor spaces are represented as vertical lines. We illustrate this in figure 2. If L is a line bundle over T, a section is a smooth map T  L, defined by the condition that it should be covariantly constant over the twistor surfaces associated to T, i.e. we can think of it as a scalar field  on M such that CA = 0. So a section of L defines, by theorem 5.7, a half-integrable small deformation, and consequently a 2D twistor space T, "close to" T, see fig. 2.
Finally, in the literature on DFT (see [7]), there are weaker forms of integrability where one replaces the ordinary Lie bracket by the so-called D-bracket (a generalization of the Dorfman bracket). In particular, in [7, Proposition 5.6] it is shown that a small deformation is `weakly integrable with respect to K' if and only if a certain Maurer-Cartan equation is satisfied, where the operators involved are associated to the Lie algebroid structure. The notion of weak integrability refers to the involutivity of a subbundle in terms of the canonical D-bracket ·, · can, see [7] for details. Adapting these concepts to our formulation, the subbundle Lt is weakly integrable if, for all x, y  (Lt), it holds ( x, y can)AA = AA for some A. Equivalently, this is A( x, y can)AA = 0. By a direct calculation (using the definition of ·, · can given in [7]) one can show that this is

50

always true in our case, so any small deformation of K is weakly integrable with respect to K.
6 Summary and conclusions
In this work we have attempted to show that there is a close connection between the para-Hermitian approach to double field theory (a formulation of string theory designed to be manifestly covariant under T-duality) and the geometry of special four-dimensional manifolds that are of particular interest in general relativity. This approach to DFT is based on the consideration of para-complex structures where one of the eigenbundles is integrable, so the tangent bundle of the extended manifold has the structure of a Courant algebroid, which is one of the main objects studied in generalized geometry. We have analysed the four-dimensional version of this approach while also allowing the paracomplex structure to be complex-valued, which in turn allows us to work with different metric signatures.
One of our original motivations was to point out the similarity between some of the geometrical structures in the para-Hermitian approach to DFT, and Plebaski's hyperheavenly construction in general relativity. This connection is revealed when one observes that Plebaski's congruence of "null strings" can be understood as the foliation by integral manifolds of an involutive eigenbundle of a complex-valued "almost-complex structure". Such a structure has independent eigenbundles and so it is actually `half-integrable'. In real geometry, this phenomenon is captured by para-complex structures.
Since a spacetime manifold M is, in general, not naturally equipped with a (para)complex structure (see also below), we first deduced the general form of any almost (para)Hermitian structure in four dimensions, and we described the space of such structures over M. We did this by showing their equivalence to (anti-)self-dual 2-forms and then describing the corresponding spaces in terms of projective spaces, for the three different possible metric signatures. We showed that these spaces are certain fiber bundles over the 4-manifold, where the fibers can be real 2-spheres (Riemannian signature), 1-sheet hyperboloids (split signature), or complex 2-spheres (Lorentz signature). Noticing that an almost para-Hermitian structure is associated only to a conformal metric and to projective spinor fields, we showed how to deal with the associated "gauge freedom" by employing a formalism manifestly covariant under gauge transformations. The corresponding covariant objects are weighted fields.
Having the general form of any almost para-Hermitian structure, we proceeded to analyse integrability issues, showing that half-integrability corresponds to the existence of special spinor fields ("shear-free congruences"), and then constructing the associated Lie and Courant algebroids. We were naturally led to the problem of generalizing the algebroid structures to fields with arbitrary weights, and we showed that ordinary Lie algebroids seem to be incompatible with them, since the Leibniz rule is not compatible with the gradation of the vector bundle of weighted fields (assuming that the anchor does not vanish identically). Nevertheless, we were able to generalize the Lie algebroid differential complex, under the additional assumption of algebraically special curvature. Further applications of these generalized geometric structures are left for future work.
Finally, we discussed connections of this approach with twistors. The first obser-
51

vation is that the Lagrangian submanifolds of DFT correspond to the basic object in twistor theory, namely twistor surfaces in a 4-manifold. Such twistor surfaces arise as integral submanifolds of a half-integrable (para-)Hermitian structure K. This K defines a two-dimensional (2D) twistor space, by means of the corresponding projective spinor field satisfying the shear-free condition. If all (para-)Hermitian structures are integrable, we showed that one then gets a three-dimensional (3D) twistor space, which is a oneparameter family of 2D twistor spaces, parametrized by projective spinor fields. In general this is not a fibration over projective spinors: the fibration structure is obtained iff the vacuum Einstein equations hold. We discussed connections of this construction with other developments such as the Atiyah-Hitchin-Singer and the LeBrun-Mason approaches to twistor theory, and also with the CP1 twistor families known in the literature. Lastly, we analysed deformations of a para-complex structure K in M, and we showed that a small deformation is half-integrable iff it corresponds to a section of a line bundle over the 2D twistor space associated to K. We also found that small half-integrable deformations can only exist if the Weyl tensor is half-algebraically special.
As mentioned, a choice of (para-)complex structure in a spacetime manifold is in general an extra assumption, and this is one of the reasons why we first focused on classifying all such possible choices. However, for 4-manifolds there are, at least, two situations of interest where natural almost (para-)complex manifolds arise:
1. Einstein manifolds with algebraically special Weyl tensor,
2. Twistor theory.
The first case is perhaps the one of immediate interest in general relativity. The GoldbergSachs theorem implies that a vacuum solution (cosmological constant allowed) to the Einstein equations which is algebraically special, has at least one shear-free congruence. If the corresponding (projective) spinor field is A, one can choose any other spinor field A with AA = 0 and define a half-integrable para-Hermitian structure by (3.26). In the second case, for 4-manifolds M with a metric of Riemannian or split signature, the twistor construction associates a natural almost-complex manifold: it gives an almost-complex structure to the space of all almost-complex structures in M.
To conclude, we make a few comments about some possible directions that will be explored in future works.
First, as mentioned before, the Lie algebroid structure of a manifold with a shear-free spinor field has associated natural differential complexes that, in our case, allow to find certain potentials for problems of interest in general relativity. This particular point will be the subject of a separate work. In addition, we notice that in the current work we have merely given an explicit description of the Courant algebroid associated to such special 4-manifolds, but we have not applied the resulting construction in any interesting way. It may be worth analysing if this explicit connection between generalized geometry and spacetimes of relevance in relativity has potentially interesting consequences. More broadly, the generalized notions of integrability encountered in double field theory (such as the D-bracket or the associated metric algebroids) were not applied in this work.
In addition, we have not attempted to analyse applications of the notion of T-duality that is obtained in general relativity by particularizing the DFT framework to 4-manifolds.
52

However, an immediate observation is that, for Einstein manifolds of Petrov type D, there is a natural para-Hermitian structure where both eigenbundles are integrable, and one eigenbundle is associated to ingoing principal null directions while the other one is associated to outgoing p.n.d.'s. The transformation between ingoing and outgoing p.n.d.'s can then be understood as a T-duality transformation. The question of whether this has some interesting consequences for e.g. black hole spacetimes (or perturbations thereof) is left for future work.
Another point that will be elaborated on in a separate work is the relationship between the bundle of complex-valued almost-complex structures in a 4-manifold and the theory of H-space and asymptotic twistor space (see section 5.2.1).
Finally, a possible generalization to higher dimensional manifolds of some of the ideas developed in this work will likely follow the perspective and results in [39]. A spinorial treatment should involve the use of pure spinors.

A Spinors in four dimensions

In this appendix we review some basic facts about spinors at a point in four dimensions, in any signature. For spinor fields, see the beginning of Appendix B.
Given a d-dimensional vector space with a non-degenerate inner product of signature (p, q), with p + q = d, the spin group can be defined as the double covering of the identity
component of the orthogonal group, that is Spin(p, q) = SOo(p, q). In four dimensions, one has the following isomorphisms depending on the signature:

Spin(1, 3) = SL(2, C), Spin(4) = SU(2) × SU(2),
Spin(2, 2) = SL(2, R) × SL(2, R).

(A.1) (A.2) (A.3)

The natural (inequivalent) representations of SL(2, C) are C2 and C¯ 2. For SU(2), the natural representation is C2 (which in this case is equivalent as a representation to C¯ 2), and

for SL(2, R) the natural representation is R2. Therefore, in all cases the finite dimensional

irreducible representations are classified by two integers or half-integers (n, m), that are

said

to

be of

opposite chirality.

The

fundamentals

are

(

1 2

,

0)

and

(0,

1 2

).

We

see that,

in

the

Lorentzian and Riemannian cases, spinors are complex, while in neutral signature they

are real. Furthermore, in Lorentz signature, complex conjugation interchanges chirality (i.e. it maps an element of C2 to an element of C¯ 2), but in the Riemannian case it is an

involution. In the following everything is valid for any signature.

We

denote

elements

in

the

(

1 2

,

0)

representation

by

e.g.

A,

and

elements

in

(0,

1 2

)

by

e.g.

A .

The

vector

representation

is

(

1 2

,

1 2

)

=

(

1 2

,

0)



(0,

1 2

),

thus,

a

vector

va

can be

represented as an object with a pair of spinor indices vAA. The map from va to vAA is

va  vAA = aAAva, where a represents the identity and the three Pauli matrices. It

53

is customary to omit aAA in this correspondence, so that one simply associates a vector index with a pair of spinor indices of opposite chirality, e.g. va  vAA, etc.; in this work

we follow this convention.

The spin spaces are equipped with the symplectic structures AB and AB. The

inverses

are

denoted

by

AB

and

AB ,

and

they

satisfy

AC BC

=

AB

and

  AC BC

=

AB. These objects allow to raise and lower spinor indices; our convention is

A := ABB,

A := BAB,

(A.4)

and analogously for primed indices. The relation between AB, AB and the metric is
simply gab = gAABB = ABAB . Given two spinors A, A with ABAB =  = 0, and using the convention (A.4) to
define A, A, we have

AB = -1(AB - BA), AB = - -1(AB - AB).

(A.5) (A.6)

These identities are used repeatedly throughout this work. For example, consider a spinor AB = (AB), then using the identity

AB = C ADBCD

(A.7)

and replacing (A.6) one gets the expression (3.23).
Any symmetric spinor can be decomposed into a symmetrized product of 1-index
spinors, which are then called its principal spinors. This is a consequence of the fact
that the field of complex numbers is algebraically closed, see Proposition (3.5.18) in [25]. We illustrate this with a simple example. Using a basis A, A, with AA =  = 0, let A = A + zA, and consider AB = (AB). Then

p(z) := ABAB = 0 + 21z + 2z2 = (z - z+)(z - z-),

(A.8)

where we assume 2 = 0, and the roots z± are

z± = -2 1(-1 ± (21 - 02)1/2).

(A.9)

Then the principal spinors of AB are A± = A + z±A, and

AB = -22(+AB-).

(A.10)

It is important to note, however, that the principal spinors may be complex. This is

of course always true in Riemannian and Lorentz signature, but in split signature, a

symmetric spinor can be real while its principal spinors are complex. This depends

on whether the roots z± are real or complex, which in turn depends on the sign of

-

1 2

AB

AB

=

-2(21 - 02).

If 21 - 02  0, then z± are real and the principal

spinors A± are real. If 21 - 02 < 0, then z± are complex conjugates, and A+ = (A-).

54

B Further details on the covariant formalism

Here we give more details on the covariant formalism introduced in section 3.3.
Let Pspin denote the principal fibre bundle corresponding to the spin structure in the conformal manifold. Let G be the associated structure group: G = Spin(p, q) × R+, where Spin(p, q) is one of the three groups (A.1)­(A.3) (and R+ accounts for the conformal rescalings of the metric). Let V = (kK2)  (kK¯ 2)  (lK2)  (lK¯ 2), where K = C for signature (+ - --) and (+ + ++), and K = R for (+ + --) (in which case "R¯ " is
simply another copy of R). The spinor bundles are the associated vector bundles

SB ...B  ... C...C...

=

Pspin

×G

V

(B.1)

where

SB ...B  ... C...C...

has

k

unprimed

and

k

primed

indices

in

the

upper

position,

and

l

unprimed

and l primed indices in the lower position; and ×G denotes the "natural" representation

of G on V 23. For only one index, we also use the notation S = SB, S = SB, S = SB,

S = SB .

A spinor field is a section of (B.1). But in this work we also need weighted spinor

fields, as a consequence of the fact that we have the `gauge freedom' (3.27) and (3.45). In

section 3.3 we mentioned that the gauge group associated to this freedom is Go. We see

that the transformation law (3.46) corresponds simply to the representation of Go on V

given by r,r;w : Go  GL(V ),

[r,r;w(, µ, )]CB......CB...... = rµr wCB......CB.......

(B.2)

The principal bundle B over M whose structure group is Go can be understood as a `reduction' of Pspin (in the sense that Go  G), and, similarly to (B.1), we now have the

weighted spinor bundles

SCB......CB......(r, r; w) = B ×r,r;w V.

(B.3)

A spinor field of type (r, r; w) (Definition 3.10) is a section of this bundle. For example,

the spinor fields A, A associated to a given almost para-Hermitian structure K, and the scalar field  = AA, are all sections of (B.3), for different values of r, r, w. We give the
specific weights in table 1. For convenience we mention that objects without indices, i.e.

weighted scalar fields, are sections of the line bundles

S(r, r; w) = B ×r,r;w V

(B.4)

where V = C or V = R.

The covariant derivative introduced in Definition 3.11 is an operator on sections of

(B.3), whose construction can be understood as follows. First, use the spinors A, A

associated to K as a basis: AA  (A, A) (where A = 0, 1 is understood as a concrete index), with AA = . The dual frame is AA = (--1A, -1A). The natural Weyl connection wa induced by K defines a local connection 1-form by waBB = waBCBC,

or equivalently

waBC = CB waBB.

(B.5)

23More precisely, the tensor product of the natural representations. Also, we are being a bit sloppy since G also includes the conformal rescalings R+, so this representation is understood to have also some
definite conformal weight. But this is not important here since it is accounted for anyway in (B.2).

55

Under Go, some parts of this object transform covariantly, and some other do not. The components that transform covariantly are wa01 and wa10. For the rest, one can check that
wa00 -Go wa00 + w0-1a + -1a,
wa11 -Go wa11 + w1-1a + µ-1aµ.

Therefore, defining the 1-forms

La := - wa00 - w0fa, Ma := - wa11 - w1fa,

(B.6a) (B.6b)

and recalling the Lee-form fa, we have

fa -Go fa - -1a, La -Go La - -1a, Ma -Go Ma - µ-1aµ,

so a := (fa, La, Ma) can be thought of as the connection 1-form associated to the gauge symmetry Go. The explicit expression of La and Ma in terms of the spinors A, A is given in formulas (3.48), (3.49). For fa, a calculation shows the following:

Proposition B.1. The Lee form (2.31) induced by an almost-para Hermitian structure

K is given by

fAA = -2(AC BBA C + AC BBA C ).

(B.7)

where A and A are the (projective) spinor fields representing K, with  = AA.

Now, consider an element u = (x, y, z)  Lie(Go) in the Lie algebra of Go. The representation (B.2) of Go induces a representation r,r;w of Lie(Go), given by

r,r;w(u) = rx + ry + wz.

(B.8)

Since the connection 1-form a is valued in Lie(Go), we have r,r;w(a) = rLa+rMa+wfa. Combining this with the Weyl connection wa, the induced covariant derivative is

wa + r,r;w(a) =: Ca

(B.9)

which is simply (3.47). For convenience we give the explicit formula for (B.9) in terms

CAA  = 0.

Remark B.3. Recalling the definition (3.51) of CA, C~A, we deduce from (B.11b) and (B.11c) the general identities

CAB = 0,

C~A B = 0.

(B.12)

C Curvature of Ca

In this appendix we describe some properties of the curvature of the connection (B.9),
that we need in the main text. The curvature of Ca is defined by the commutator [Ca, Cb]. Since this is skew-symmetric in ab, the decomposition (3.1) implies that [Ca, Cb] splits into SD and ASD pieces; this will be applied below.
Let vAA be a vector field with weights (r, r; w). Then by definition

CbvDD = bvDD + bvDD + WbC DvCD + W~ bC D vCD,

(C.1)

where for convenience we put

b = wfb + rLb + rMb, WbC D = fBC B D, W~ bC D = fBC B D .

(C.2) (C.3) (C.4)

Applying another covariant derivative Ca and taking the commutator, after a short calculation we find

[Ca, Cb]vDD = [a, b]vDD + (2[ab])vDD + FabC DvCD + F~abC DvCD

(C.5)

where

FabC D := 2[aWb]C D + 2W[a|E|DWb]C E ,

F~abC D

:=

2[aW~ b]C D

(C.6) (C.7)

We can see three contributions to (C.5): the curvature of the Levi-Civita connection, the curvature of the "internal" connection b, and the curvature of the Weyl connection, which is encoded in the two pieces FabC D and F~abCD.
Now, a straightforward computation shows that

[Ca,

(C.11) (C.12) (C.13) (C.14)

The spinors G, F are respectively the SD and ASD pieces of FabCD, and G~, F~ those of F~abC D. Likewise, A(ABA) and A(ABA) are the SD and ASD pieces of 2[ab]. Remark C.1. For weighted scalars , formulas (C.9)-(C.10) are much simpler:

CA(ACB)A  = (A(ABA) ),

CA(A

=

(A(A BA )).

(C.15)

Using (C.2) and the expressions (3.48)-(3.49) for La, Ma, we note that a = (w - rw0 - rw1)fa + ra() + ra(),

(C.16)

where

a() = - -1BAAB - -1AfABB, a() = -1BAA B + -1AfABB.

(C.17) (C.18)

Note also that a() can be rewritten as a() = -a() - a log  - fa; therefore, the

curvature of the "internal" connection can be computed in terms of the curvatures of fa

and a():

[ab] = (w - r - rw0 - rw1)[afb] + (r - r)[ab(]).

(C.19)

For later use, we note in particular the following:

ABA(ABA) = (w - r - rw0 - rw1)ABA(AfBA) + (r - r)ABA(AB())A . (C.20)

Some identities when A is shear-free
Proposition C.2. Suppose that A is shear-free, then we have the following identities:

ABCDC D + GABCDC D = 0, ABCDCD + 2AB + FABCDC D = 0.

(C.21) (C.22)

Proof. These identities follow from (C.10) and (C.9) by applying them to D, using CaB = 0, and contracting with D.
Proposition C.3. If A is shear-free, we have:

which establishes the first equality in (C.24). Now, applying (C.9) to D and contracting with AB, we get

0 = ABCDABC + (BC B(BC())B )D + FABCDABC.

From (C.26) we deduce that ABCDABC = -FDABC ABC, where we used ABCD = (ABCD). Thus,

0 = (BC B(BC())B )D - FDABC ABC + FABCDABC . The last term in the right hand side is

(C.27)

FABCDABC = (A|D| B)C fC C + fB)C fC C ABC = (B C B(B fCB) )D,

which shows that FABCDABC = -2FDABC ABC. Therefore

(BC B(B C())B )D = 3FDABC ABC = -3ABCDABC ,

and the last equality in (C.24) follows.

Remark C.4. Using (C.24), when A is shear-free we can deduce a useful identity for (C.20), for arbitrary weights w, r, r in (C.2):

Lemma C.5. Suppose that A is shear-free. Then the equation

(C.28)

CACA = 0

(C.29)

is satisfied when acting on any weighted scalar/spinor/tensor field, if and only if A is a repeated principal spinor of the ASD Weyl curvature.

Proof. Consider first a primed spinor field A, with arbitrary weights (r, r; w). Applying (C.9) to A and contracting with AB, we have

CA CA D = AB AB D + (ABA(ABA) )D + ABG~ABC D C

= (AB ABC D + ABG~ABC D )C + (AB A(ABA) )D

where in the third line we replaced (C.23), and in the fourth we used (C.20) and the
second equality in (C.24). Therefore, we see that CACAD = 0 for any D if and only if ABA(AfBA) = 0, which, using the first equality in (C.24), is true if and only if ABCDBC D = 0.
Consider now an unprimed spinor field A with weights (r, r; w). This can be written
as A = aA + bA. Using CaB = 0 and the first equation in (B.12), we have

CACA D = DCACAa + DCA CAb.

(C.30)

Thus, we see that CACAD = 0 on arbitrary weighted unprimed spinor fields D if and only if CACA = 0 for arbitrary weighted scalar fields. From (C.15), we get

CACA  = (ABA(ABA) ).

(C.31)

Using now (C.20) and (C.24), we see that CACA = 0 if and only if ABCDBCD = 0.
