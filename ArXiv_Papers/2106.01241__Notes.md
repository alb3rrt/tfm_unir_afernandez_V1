## Abstract

We consider the stochastic optimal control problem for the dynamical system of stochastic differential equation driven by a local martingale with spatial parameter. Assuming convexity of the control domain, we obtain the stochastic maximum principle as a necessary condition for an optimal control. The linear quadratic (LQ) problem in this setting is also discussed.
