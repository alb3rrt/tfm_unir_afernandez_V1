Abstract: We discuss renormalization group flows in two-dimensional quantum field theories with (0,2) supersymmetry. We focus on theories with UV described by a Landau-Ginzburg Lagrangian and use the chiral algebra to constrain the IR dynamics. We present examples where the structure of the chiral algebra is incompatible with unitarity of the IR superconformal theory and discuss the implications of this result for programs of classifying (0,2) SCFTs as endpoints of flows from simple Lagrangian theories.

1 Introduction
The renormalization group flow plays a key role in the study of quantum field theory. In its simplest application it offers an interconnection between two, usually different, theories: an ultraviolet (UV) theory valid at high energies, and the low energy infrared (IR) theory. A well-studied situation is where the IR theory is a non-trivial conformal field theory, while the UV theory is Lagrangian and asymptotically free. In this case we can hope to construct interesting conformal field theories from the simpler UV description.
­1­

This is not an abstract hope: examples of such flows are known, and some key properties of the corresponding conformal field theories are computed explicitly. For example twodimensional superconformal field theories (SCFTs) with (2,2) supersymmetry are constructed in this fashion from super-renormalizable two-dimensional gauged linear sigma models [1]. The computable IR quantities go well beyond matching anomalies and global symmetries or even elliptic genera. For instance, is possible to compute the dependence of the chiral ring of the SCFT on the marginal deformations representable as deformations of couplings in the UV Lagrangian [2]1 , as well as the sphere partition functions [5, 6].
While much remains to be understood about the landscape of (2,2) SCFTs, a more mysterious realm beckons: the (0,2) SCFTs. As already pointed out in [1, 7], the linear sigma model approach generalizes to this case, and in examples explicit computations generalizing the (2,2) results have been performed--see, e.g. [8, 9]. More precisely, these results were obtained in (0,2) theories that are smooth deformations of (2,2) theories.
To what extent can these techniques be extended to "genuine" (0,2) SCFTs? Is it possible to classify the landscape of (0,2) SCFTs obtained from (0,2) linear sigma models? These questions motivated the present work, and our results suggest that the answers are subtle and will require new tools.
Ultimately, the structure that is responsible for the successes in the analysis of the (2,2) theories and their (0,2) deformations is the chiral algebra [10, 11]: the cohomology of the right-moving supercharge Q. In the SCFT this cohomology group, which we will denote H, is isomorphic to the vector space of right-moving (in our conventions anti-holomorphic) chiral primary operators and includes the left-moving (holomorphic) energy-momentum tensor and any other holomorphic conserved currents. The operator product, when restricted to cohomology, endows this vector space with the structure of a holomorphic vertex operator algebra. The topological heterotic rings of [12, 13] are sub-sectors of this vertex operator algebra that generalize the (c,c) and (a,c) rings of (2,2) theories and share some properties with local operators in topological field theory.
It is believed that under fairly weak assumptions the chiral algebra is a "renormalization group invariant" of the theory. In a wide class of super-renormalizable (0,2) Lagrangian theories the UV Q-cohomology has a presentation in terms of free fields--a sort of bc­ system familiar from the superstring worldsheet [10, 14].2 When the theory is defined with a Wilsonian renormalization energy scale µ, there is an argument that the Q-cohomology is independent of µ for 0 < µ < .3
Consequently, if one assumes a smooth µ  0 limit of the chiral algebra structure, it is possible to compute non-trivial properties of the SCFT by doing free-field computations! Early uses of these structures included the determination of the massless spectrum of heterotic
1For a modern localization perspective the reader can consult [3]. A pedagogical discussion of this, as well as other topics in this paper, is given in [4].
2A modern discussion in the context of (0,2) Landau-Ginzburg models can be found in [15]. 3Early work includes [10, 16]. A formal argument for the statement in the case of (0,2) Landau-Ginzburg theory is given in [15].

compactifications based on Landau-Ginzburg (LG) orbifolds [17] and constraints on (0,2) RG flows [16]. Recent work includes the construction of a wide class of so-called hybrid CFTs [18, 19]. Some of these results, especially in the context of (2,2) theories, suggest that in many cases the chiral algebra of the SCFT is correctly reproduced by the UV computations.
A simple example illustrates some of the subtleties of the µ  0 limit. Consider a (2,2) LG theory with a single chiral superfield  with lowest component  and a superpotential

W

(1.1)

There is a renormalization scheme in which W is not renormalized, and the chiral algebra has an operator  and relation g32 - g43 = 0. However, when g3 and g4 are both non-zero, this relation does not reflect the IR physics. The IR physics depends on the choice of SUSY vacuum, labeled by the expectation value  = , with either  = 0 or  = g3/g4. The former yields a massless theory--the A1 N=2 minimal model with (c,c) ring generated by an operator X obeying X2 = 0, while the latter is a massive theory.
In this example we can resolve the ambiguity: expanding around either vacuum in terms of a field X = ( - ), and demanding that the R-symmetry acts linearly on X, we understand the low energy behavior of the RG flow as either an irrelevant deformation of the A1 SCFT ( = 0) or a massive theory ( = g3/g4). The choice of R-charge also determines the scaling of the operator as the theory flows to the IR. In investigations of LG models, one typically assumes such a rescaling has been performed (and the coefficients of irrelevant deformations have been set to zero) by imposing a quasi-homogeneity condition on the superpotential.
In (0,2) theories there are additional subtleties associated to the µ  0 limit of theories with an isolated vacuum. We will show examples with a seemingly unique choice of scaling of the chiral operators determined by the R-symmetry and the chiral algebra for µ = 0, for which the resulting chiral algebra cannot be the chiral algebra of a unitary compact (0,2) SCFT.
The examples we study are (0,2) LG theories. The UV theory is a family of (0,2) Lagrangians preserving a UV symmetry U(1)k × U(1)R,uv, with k  1 and the first factor describing a global symmetry of the theory. The interactions are determined by a (0,2) superpotential W--a polynomial in the chiral superfields that has spin 1/2, is invariant under the global symmetry, and carries UV R-charge +1. A generic theory in the family is obtained by including in W all possible monomials in the fields compatible with these symmetries. We assume that there is a finite number of such monomials, say P , and define Muv = CP to be the "UV parameter space" of holomorphic couplings, i.e. the values of the coefficients for the monomials in W. There is a discriminant subvariety 0  Muv where the scalar potential has non-compact directions in field space. We are interested in theories with an isolated classical SUSY vacuum, so we restrict the UV parameters to lie in Muv \ 0.
Fixing a family with Muv \ 0 non-empty, we would like to describe the possible IR fixed points that are obtained via RG flow from theories in this family. It is clear that Muv \ 0 is a vast over-parameterization of the fixed points. One source of redundancy is from the action

­3­

of holomorphic field redefinitions, which induce a 0-preserving action of a group G on Muv. We assume that the D-terms are irrelevant in the sense of RG, and it must then be that every G-orbit in Muv \ 0 flows to the same IR fixed point. So, the quotient

M = {Muv \ 0}/G

(1.2)

should provide a better description of the possible IR fixed points. There are a number of subtleties associated with this description. First, M will not in general be a separated space, so that the geometric import of the quotient is obscure. Second, there are in general further IR equivalences: two distinct orbits can flow to the same fixed point. This is a feature we encountered in our previous work [20]. Finally, there is another possibility: 0 may not be the true discriminant of the theory, and instead there is a subset   Muv, which may contain 0 as a component, where the IR fixed points fails to be a compact SCFT. In other words, even if W has no flat directions the IR limit may fail to be a compact SCFT unless the UV parameters lie in Muv \ , and it may be that this set is empty for our family of UV theories.
In this work we will consider these structures from the point of view of the chiral algebra of the (0,2) LG theory. We will assume that a (0,2) LG theory flows to a unitary compact IR SCFT and show that this strongly constrains the form of the chiral algebra if we assume a smooth µ  0 limit. For example, the holomorphic energy-momentum tensor has a unique representative in H, and we can use it to find the R-charges of all chiral primary operators.
We will exhibit examples where the chiral algebra detects the sorts of accidental symmetries studied in [20]: more precisely, additional currents, while not symmetries of the Lagrangian, can be found as holomorphic spin­1 operators in H, and properly including them modifies the Virasoro and Kac-Moody charges of the operators in H. We will also see examples where the chiral algebra cannot have a smooth µ  0 limit.
The rest of the note is organized as follows. In section 2 we will set up our conventions for (0,2) Landau-Ginzburg models, review the properties relevant for our analysis, and obtain a number of constraints on the chiral algebra. Next, in section 3, we turn to a number of examples of varying complexity, illustrating the interplay between the UV symmetries, field redefinitions, the chiral algebra, and various unitarity constraints. In section 4 we present LG theories that do not lie in the naive discriminant 0 but nevertheless cannot flow to a compact unitary SCFT. We end with a discussion and implications of this result in section 5. A number of technical computations are relegated to the appendix.

The UV Lagrangian theories are built with two types of (0,2) chiral superfields and their

conjugates: the bosonic chiral fields a, with a = 1, . . . , n, and the fermionic chiral fields A, A = 1, . . . , N . Each a has lowest component a bosonic field a, while a A has lowest component A, a Weyl fermion. By definition, the chiral fields are annihilated by D.

The Euclidean action has a standard kinetic term quadratic in the fields, as well as the

It is easy to see that Q2 = 0, Q2 = 0, and, using the  equations of motion, {Q, Q} = ¯.

Symmetries and charges
The (0,2) superpotential W determines the generators of an ideal W = W1, . . . , WN in the polynomial ring C[1, . . . , n]. We restrict attention to quasi-homogeneous ideals, i.e. there is a linear torus action (C)k on the a

(2.6)

When this is the case the action enjoys a U(1)k global symmetry that assigns charges qa to the a and QA to the A superfields. The action also has an R-symmetry U(1)R,uv with

These conditions are the defining relations of the R-multiplet and current multiplets in (0,2) theories [4, 15, 21]. The left-hand column is easy to understand: taking the lowest component in the superspace expansion, we just obtain the standard conserved currents of this Lagrangian theory.

and these components will satisfy the defining relations of the R-multiplet. We are interested in W for which the low-energy dynamics is determined by a compact,
unitary (0,2) SCFT with a unique vacuum state. To this end we restrict the UV parameters to lie in Muv \ 0, so that W has the origin as the unique zero of the scalar potential, or, equivalently, W is a zero-dimensional quasi-homogeneous ideal. Note this is only possible when N  n.
We will also make a simplifying technical assumption: linear terms of the form mAbb  WA indicate massive fields that can be integrated out. Since our interest is in the IR dynamics, we assume this has been done, and such terms are absent.

2.2 IR Expectations
With our assumptions, the symmetries of the IR theory will include symmetries of the UV theory, as well as conformal invariance and possibly emergent enhanced symmetry.6 If the SCFT is compact and unitary, the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic components of any
6Some of the UV symmetries may decouple at low energy, i.e. some UV symmetries may turn out to act trivially in the IR. We will not encounter this phenomenon in our study of LG theories: every UV symmetry will act non-trivially on the chiral algebra.

conserved current are conserved separately.7 The right-moving (anti-holomorphic) currents generate an N =2 superconformal algebra. This can be enhanced in several ways: for example, SUSY can be extended, there can be right-moving symmetry currents, or multiple copies of the entire N =2 algebra [23]. We will suppose the SCFT has two supercharges obtained as the low energy limit of the UV supercharges Q, Q, and the corresponding anti-holomorphic supercurrents reside in a superconformal current multiplet with lowest component the right-
moving R-current Jir and top component the right-moving energy momentum tensor T ir. We will also for the moment assume that J ir is the only right-moving spin­1 current in the SCFT and ignore any possibility of enhancement in the right-moving sector.
Unitarity with respect to the right-moving N = 2 algebra implies well-known constraints [24] on the charge q and the right-moving Virasoro weight of a state: h  |q|/2.
Equality holds for chiral(antichiral) primary states, annihilated by the supercharge Q(Q). The Sugawara constraint h  3q2/2c implies that for chiral primary states q  c/3.
The left-moving (holomorphic) sector of the SCFT is less constrained. The currents include a Kac­Moody­Virasoro (KMV) algebra generated by the energy-momentum tensor Tir(z) and a collection of spin­1 holomorphic currents. Let Vir be the KMV sub-algebra generated by Tir and the U(1)R,uv­neutral holomorphic currents. We will also denote by Vir  Vir the KMV sub-algebra consisting of Tir and the currents Jm that span the maximal abelian ideal in Vir.
Unitarity of the KMV representation implies that the OPE of the currents in Vir is

J m(z)J n(w)



M mn (z - w)2

,

(2.13)

where M is positive definite, and the charges qm and conformal weight h of any state satisfy h  (qT M -1q)/2.
The LG theory exhibits an R-symmetry along the flow determined by U(1)R,uv, associated to the conserved current JR,uv given by the lowest component of the R-multiplet. JR,uv flows to some conserved current in the SCFT, and if Jir is the unique right-moving spin­1 current, the difference Jir = Jir - JR,uv is a distinguished left-moving (holomorphic) current. In particular, the charges (q, q) of all states under (Jir, J ir) satisfy q - q = quv  Z. We can choose a basis for the currents so that the distinguished symmetry Jir has zero two-point functions with the remaining k - 1 currents, and

Jir(z)Jir(w) 

r (z - w)2

.

(2.14)

Unitarity implies that the "level" r is positive; its value is fixed by the normalizations of JR,uv and J ir.
It may seem that the existence of the privileged holomorphic current Jir depends on our assumption that Jir is the unique anti-holomorphic spin­1 current. We will show at the level
7See, for example, [22].

­8­

of the chiral algebra that the result is more general: there is a current Jir  Vir such that the R-charges of all chiral primary operators are determined by qir = qir + quv.

Spectral flow and holomorphic fields

As we have seen, the charges with respect to Jir, Jir satisfy qir - qir  Z, and therefore the SCFT spectrum includes the operator  that generates non-chiral spectral flow by one
unit [24, 25]. Bosonizing the currents as

 Jir(z) = i r (z) ,

Jir = i c/3 ¯(z) ,

(2.15)

we can represent  and its conjugate  by8

 = e-i

r


+ c/3



,



= ei

r


+ c/3



.

(2.16)

Acting on the vacuum by  produces a chiral state with (qir, qir) = (r, c/3) and weights (h, h) = (r/2, c/6). This is the unique state with these charges and weights: a multiplicity of

such states would imply a multiplicity of vacua.

Chiral primary fields with charge qir = c/3 are related to holomorphic fields. A primary field  with charges (qir, c/3) and weights (h, c/6) can be written as

 = ei

qirr


+ c/3

X

,

where X has trivial OPEs with Jir and Jir, so that the OPE (z, z)(w, w)  (z - w)-qir (z - w)-c/3 ei qir-rr X(w)
= (w)
yields a holomorphic field  of charges (qir - r, 0) and weights (h - qir + r/2, 0).

OPE of chiral primary fields
More generally, for all chiral primary fields denoted by Oi, whether holomorphic or not, the OPE takes the form

Oi(z, z)Oj (0) = Cij kzsk-si-sj Ok(0) + Q(· · · ) ,
k

(2.17)

where si is the spin of Oi. As we discuss next, we will be able to study this structure as an algebra on the cohomology of Q and compute it in terms of the UV fields of the LG theory. This will be our main tool for translating the constraints imposed by unitarity of the IR theory to conditions on W beyond the two we have already imposed, namely that W should be quasi-homogeneous and zero-dimensional.

8In appendix B we make some comments on representing  in the chiral algebra of LG theories.

­9­

2.3 The chiral algebra of (0,2) Landau-Ginzburg theories
The supersymmetry algebra implies that the cohomology class [O(z, z)]  H of a Q-closed operator is z-independent. This means the OPE of Q-closed operators descends to a holomorphic OPE in cohomology. The position dependence is determined by Lorentz invariance and can be expressed in terms of the spins of the operators:

[Oi(z)][Oj (0)] = Cij kzsk-si-sj [Ok(w)] .
k

(2.18)

This is the chiral algebra9 of the theory, and when the end-point of the RG flow is a compact SCFT, we expect this to coincide with the algebra of chiral primary operators in the SCFT. In studying the OPE we will work exclusively in cohomology in what follows, and where confusion is unlikely we will conflate a Q-closed operator with its cohomology class.
While the algebra on H can be defined for any QFT (and then compared to the SCFT that emerges at low energy), it is particularly computable in LG theories with isolated vacua: the UV theory is super-renormalizable, ensuring that the algebra has an exact presentation in terms of free fields a, a = a, A and A with OPEs

This will prove useful in our calculations.

2.4 Holomorphic field redefinitions
The free field presentation inherited from the Lagrangian theory gives a concrete way to evaluate the chiral algebra, but it is no no way canonical. Indeed, for the purposes of computing the chiral algebra it may well be that another choice of fields is more convenient. In order to commute with the (0,2) supersymmetry action and U(1)R,uv, such a field redefinition should be holomorphic, i.e. take the form
9The chiral algebra of a CFT was introduced in [26] to mean the OPE algebra of the holomorphic fields. In our context it has become customary to use the term to denote a different vertex operator algebra, the OPE algebra of Q cohomology. We use the term in the latter sense.

2.5 Holomorphic cohomology and symmetries in LG models
The holomorphic fields of the SCFT are chiral primary with q = 0, and they form a subalgebra of the algebra of chiral primary operators. The conjugate (in the sense of producing identity via the OPE) field of any holomorphic field must also be holomorphic, and this leads to strong
10This structure plays an important role in curved bc­ systems that play a role in pure spinor strings [27], or in the chiral algebra of (0,2) NLSMs or hybrid theories [11, 18, 19, 28]. In those cases there are bc­ systems in each patch of the targetspace, and the systems are related by holomorphic redefinitions of this form on overlaps. The triviality of the targetspace is a significant simplification of the LG setting.

unitarity constraints on the chiral algebra. The holomorphic subalgebra includes the KMV
algebra Vir defined above, which will be our primary focus in the following. Some of the symmetries in Vir are inherited from the UV theory: the current multiplets
(K, I) of (2.9) generate symmetries present along the flow. The superfields

M measures the mixed anomaly between the two currents. We assume, as is the case in all of our examples, that this is positive definite. Because M is also field-independent and therefore R-neutral, each J must be R-neutral as well, and that means all of the currents J descend to nontrivial commuting holomorphic currents that belong to Vir. We denote the KMV sub-algebra generated by Tir and the currents J by Vuv.
The IR theory may enjoy emergent symmetries in addition to those already present in the UV. In a compact unitary SCFT each of the continuous symmetries should be anti-
holomorphic or holomorphic, and each of the holomorphic currents should have a representative in the chiral algebra. We will now describe all such currents that are neutral with respect to U(1)R,uv.

where the coefficients A, B, and C are further constrained by Q · J = 0. We will now show that the last term must be absent, i.e. Ca = 0 for all a if the chiral algebra describes the
chiral primary states of a unitary compact SCFT.

­ 12 ­

The current J must be neutral under the IR R-symmetry generated by Jir. This Rsymmetry must act linearly on the space of spin­0 chiral primary fields, and in the LG chiral algebra this space is isomorphic to the quotient ring

RW = C[1, . . . , n]/W .

(2.33)

Unitarity implies that the R-symmetry action on RW must be diagonalizable, and the action
must respect the OPE structure, which is simply multiplication in the ring RW. As we show
in Appendix A, our assumptions on the R-symmetry action and the ideal imply that we can find a holomorphic field redefinition to obtain n generators a = fa(1, . . . , n) of RW that transform linearly under the R-symmetry:

a = iqaa ,

(2.34)

where  is the infinitesimal parameter. Unitarity further implies that qa  0, and compactness excludes qa = 0: any spin­0 chiral field with qa = 0 would be a non-identity operator of zero dimension and spin. It follows that any R-neutral current J cannot have a term of the form Ca()a, and in terms of the original fields this implies that Ca() = 0 in J.
So, the most general form of a holomorphic U(1)R,uv-neutral current is of the form

J[A, B] =

The solutions to these linear equations in the coefficients of the polynomials Aa and BAB determine the space of all Q-closed spin­1 fields. We denote by JM a basis for this space.
Not all of these correspond to conserved holomorphic currents. There is a subspace associated to Q-trivial solutions: these are symmetries that act trivially in the IR theory.

­ 13 ­

In addition, it is possible that some of solutions to (2.37) determine spin­1 fields of positive R-charge despite being neutral under the UV symmetry. An expedient way to detect which of the solutions determine true IR symmetries is to compute the OPE

J M (z)J N (w)

where the symmetric matrix M has components

MMN =

a,b=1

(2.40)

The coefficients M MN will in general be field-dependent, but from our discussion of the Rsymmetry action, it is clear that such a term cannot arise from the OPE of two R-neutral currents. So, we see that the kernel of M |=0 will contain exact currents (which have nonsingular OPE with all closed fields) as well as R-charged fields (which cannot produce the identity under OPE with any chiral field). Projecting out the kernel of M |=0 is thus an expedient way to determine the full holomorphic symmetry of the IR theory that commutes with U(1)R,uv: these are the currents in Vir.
To obtain the abelian currents in Vir, we just further restrict this sector to the abelian holomorphic currents labeled by Jm, with OPE given by the positive-definite matrix M mn. In practice, to obtain Vir we can restrict to currents JM that commute with the currents J of Vuv, and this leads to a significant simplification in finding this smaller symmetry algebra.
General holomorphic symmetry currents for N = n
A holomorphic current J may in principle have terms charged with respect to U(1)R,uv. However, we show in appendix C that when N = n every holomorphic current still takes the form given in (2.35,2.37) and is in fact U(1)R,uv­neutral.
2.6 The KMV algebra in cohomology
The fact that there can be accidental symmetries in the IR theory, and that these can, by mixing with the UV R-symmetry, invalidate predictions about the IR theory based on the UV symmetries has been known for a long time [4, 23, 29]. What we add to the discussion is, in the restricted context of (0,2) LG models, an explicit calculation of the full IR symmetry. To determine the IR R-symmetry, we determine the left-moving energy-momentum tensor Tir, or more precisely its representative in H2. The R-charge of any chiral operator is then determined by its dimension h with respect to Tir and its spin s:

qir = 2h = 2(h - s) .

(2.41)

To determine Tir we observe that the Virasoro generator L0 =

dz 2i

zTir

(z)

must

have

diagonalizable actions on H0 and H1/2, and we will assume that the the spin­0 fields a and

(2.42)

where the coefficients Aa() and BBA(), which determine the action of the Virasoro generator L0, are constrained by the symmetries of the theory, including the R-symmetry.
Before we pursue the consequences of (2.42), we point out that in general we might expect a weaker form of (2.42), where the first-order poles are modified by Q-exact terms. When compared to the free field representative of Tir consistent with (2.42), this leads to additional operators that are expressed in terms of the coefficients of the Q-exact modifications of the poles, and the coefficients are subject to a set of complicated algebraic constraints involving the ideal generators WA and their derivatives. It can be shown that every Q-exact term in the simple pole of the OPE of Tir with a can be removed by shifting Tir by a Q-exact operator. We have not been able to show that the same is true of a Q-exact term in the simple pole of the OPE with A, but we suspect that the Q-exact modifications of the poles may only be possible for a special class of ideals W. In contrast, using the stronger form of (2.42) leads to a universal form for Tir just determined by the holomorphic symmetries of W. It may be interesting to pursue the general case further, but, as we will discuss in section 4.2, any such modification cannot resolve the unitarity puzzles we will encounter.
Returning now to consider (2.42), we observe that any LG theory has a spin 2 Q-closed field

T0 = - : aa : - : AA : .

(2.53)

Since L0 must commute with the R-symmetry transformations of a and A, the coefficient of the cubic pole must be constant,12 and that in turn shows that T0 is neutral with respect
to K(w). By the same logic, T0 is also neutral with respect to any current J in Vir, and

R­invariance of J implies that the coefficient of the cubic pole in the T0J OPE is field-

independent.

Therefore,

Ultimately this is the reason for our focus on this subset of currents: they are the only ones

that participate in determining the energy-momentum tensor.

So, we can expand K in our basis of spin­1 currents in Vir as

K = mJ m

(2.57)

and the R-charges are then given by (2.41):

qa = qa ,

qA = 1 + QA ,

(2.58)

and this is consistent with our definition Jir = Jir + JR,uv.

Vir and unitarity constraints
Thus, we have an algorithmic procedure to find the KMV subalgebra Vir of the chiral algebra: (i) compute the space of Q-closed, spin­1, U(1)R,uv-neutral operators, project out the kernel of the matrix M |=0; (ii) compute the improved energy momentum tensor Tir by evaluating the coefficients m. This structure already encodes a great deal of information about the IR SCFT.
More generally, we can in principle study the full chiral ring of the SCFT. This algebraic structure will in general depend on any marginal parameters that can be encoded as coefficients in the ideal generators WA, and the detailed structure goes beyond coarser invariants such as the elliptic genus of the theory. The latter is still a useful characteristic of the theory, and can be computed explicitly in gauged linear sigma models and LG theories [30­33].
What is perhaps equally remarkable is that the chiral algebra is completely determined by a choice of W, and so far we placed rather weak restrictions on it. Yet we also know that the algebra of chiral primary operators of a compact SCFT is constrained by various unitarity requirements. Some of the most basic ones are:

1. c  0;

2. for any chiral primary operator the R-charge must satisfy 0  q  c/3;

3. the leading term in the OPE of holomorphic spin­1 currents must be positive.

It is by no means obvious that these conditions hold for all W that satisfy the assumptions spelled out in the previous section. The main point of our work is to illustrate that there are cases when these conditions are not satisfied.

3 Using the chiral algebra to diagnose the IR
In this section we provide some examples of how the chiral algebra can be used to study properties of the IR theory. These demonstrate the power of the method, and the way it overcomes the limitations of attempts to use the UV properties directly to infer the IR

­ 18 ­

dynamics. In the next section, however, will show that this too has limitations, in the sense that all we will be able to determine is that a compact, unitary SCFT is not the IR theory.

The UV starting point

Our starting point is a Lagrangian formulation for the LG theory specified by a zero-dimensional

ideal W with k  1 quasi-homogeneity relations. If we assume that the IR theory does not

exhibit an accidental symmetry, then we can construct a candidate KMV algebra Vuv by

taking Jir =

k =1

J ,

where

the

currents

J

are

given

in

(2.29).

A remarkable feature of the chiral algebra structure is that it gives us an in-principle

method to find conditions on the parameters of a family of ideals W that imply an accidental

symmetry, e.g. the proper containment Vuv  Vir. In general it is not so easy to describe these

conditions explicitly, so it is useful to have some simpler diagnostics that do not involve the

full computation of Vir. One such diagnostic is obtained by applying the unitarity constraints to representations of Vuv. When these are violated, one resolution is that Vir  Vuv, and we can test for this resolution simply by computing Vir.
The reader may ask why she should bother with Vuv at all: after all, given an ideal W,

the "true" KMV algebra Vir can be obtained explicitly. There are two reasons: first, while describing Vir is conceptually straightforward, it is not so easy to construct it explicitly, even

in examples with a small number of fields and monomials in the WA; second, by studying cases with Vuv  Vir, we access the low energy physics of a strongly coupled field theory with

accidental symmetry: this may be an academic topic, but it is surely one of intrinsic interest.

Our approach to the various examples we consider will be from this point of view: we

will first study Vuv and compare it to Vir as necessary.

3.1 The k = 1 case

We begin with the generic LG theory compatible with our assumptions, where there is just a single quasi-homogeneity relation constraining the ideal W. In this case the single parameter  can be absorbed into a normalization of the charges, and (2.56) reduces to fixing this normalization so that

N

- QA(1 + QA) = qa(1 - qa) .

Once this holds, the central charges are given by

(3.3)

is the normalization of Jir as in (2.14). Now using Tir and Jir OPEs with the fields a, a, A, and A, we obtain the following
charge and weight assignments:

field spin
qir h qir

a 0 qa
qa/2 qa

a 1 -qa 1 - qa/2 -qa

A 1/2 QA 1 + QA/2 1 + QA

A 1/2 -QA -QA/2 -1 - QA

(3.4)

The last row was obtained by using (2.41). Not all of these fields belong to Q cohomology, but we can use these assignments to determine the charges and weights of operators in H that are constructed as normal-ordered products of these fields.
With some small modifications, this analysis also applies to the k > 1 setting [23, 29]: there is a preferred linear combination Jir =  J that combines with the naive Rsymmetry of the Lagrangian to yield a candidate R-symmetry in the IR, and the preceding discussion applies to that symmetry. The remaining k - 1 abelian symmetries can be taken to be orthogonal to Jir. We can also grade H with respect to these, and there will be additional unitarity conditions on the spectrum imposed by the presence of these symmetries. Finally, there may also be non-abelian symmetries of the Lagrangian theory, and they can in principle be handled by analogous techniques.

Unitarity constraints for k = 1
If Vuv  Vir, it must be that c and r calculated from (3.2,3.3) are positive. Using (3.4), we see that there are further constraints. For example, the fields a and A are always non-trivial in H.13 Therefore, it must be that

0  qa  c/3 ,

0  1 + QA  c/3 .

(3.5)

We can obtain stronger bounds on the qa by invoking compactness. First, we need qa > 0, since otherwise we have a spin­0 field with zero R-charge--a signature of non-compactness.
Furthermore, in order for the ideal W to be zero-dimensional, a necessary condition is that every field a appear with a "pure" monomial kaa in some generator WA.14 Since we are not
13This is ensured by the absence of linear terms in the WA. 14If this is not the case, there is a non-compact locus where WA = 0 for all A obtained by setting all b = 0 with b = a. This is familiar from the study of local rings in commutative algebra; see, e.g. [34].

­ 20 ­

interested in theories with mass terms, it must be that ka  2, and 1 + QA = 1 - kaqa. So, the second inequality in (3.5) now implies qa  1/2.
These are just special cases of the more general requirement mentioned above: unitarity and (2.41) imply that for any O  H with spin sO and weight hO, it must be that

2(hO - sO)  c/3 .

(3.6)

Given an ideal W with one quasi-homogeneity relation, it is in principle possible to compute sup{O}(2hO - sO), which would give the most stringent unitarity bound that we can obtain in this fashion. This does not appear to be easy and is most likely model-dependent. However, there is a universal operator that appears in H for every LG theory satisfying our assumptions. This is the operator

U = 12 · · · N  HN/2 ,

(3.7)

with spin sU = N/2 and qU = NA=1(1 + QA). U is obviously Q-closed. To be Q-exact, it must arise as Q · Y , where Y is constrained by U(1)R,uv and spin to be of the form

N

N

Y=

: fAb 1···An-1 ()A1 · · · An-1 b : +

: gA()1 · · · N A : .

A1,...,An-1=1

A=1

But, since

(3.8)

N
Q · b = - AWA,b ,
A=1

Q · A = -WA ,

(3.9)

and each WA,b is -dependent (recall that we exclude mass terms), U cannot be in the image of Q.15 In what follows, we will refer to U as the unicorn operator.
Since it is always present, if the SCFT is compact and Vuv  Vir, then

N
(1 + QA)  c/3 .
A=1

(3.10)

This is a strong requirement. For example, (3.10), (3.5), (3.2), and qa  1/2 lead to a bound on the number of bosonic fields in terms of the central charge:

c if N = n , n
4c/3 if N > n .

(3.11)

It is known [35, 36] that in LG theories with (2,2) supersymmetry, where N = n and Wa,b =
15We also checked in numerous examples that the presence of U  HN/2 is consistent with the elliptic genus of the theory.

­ 21 ­

Wb,a, the bound n  c holds for any zero-dimensional ideal; this bound plays an important role in classifying (2,2) LG theories at fixed central charge. In (0,2) theories it is possible to choose quasi-homogeneous zero-dimensional ideals consistent with (3.5) but violating (3.10): there exist infinite families of such ideals with a fixed value of c. For example, we can set N = n = 3 and take the following family labeled by a non-negative integer p:

W1 = 51 + · · · ,

W2 = 22+p + 6112+p + · · · ,

W3 = 23 + · · · ,

(3.12)

with q2 = 6q1 and q3 = (8 + 6p)q1. A generic choice of coefficients leads to k = 1 and c = 1 for any integer p. On the other hand,

(3.13)

The existence of such families is one reason why there is not a straightforward generalization of the (2,2) LG classification results to the (0,2) setting.
The theories of (3.12) have a seeming pathology since U violates the unitarity bound, but this is an ultraviolet delusion: there are accidental symmetries for all values of parameters, and Jir  Vuv. By finding Jir  Vir and computing the correct charges, we find that all unitarity bounds are satisfied and the IR fixed point is a product of three (2,2) minimal models. In what follows we will study a number of such examples.

3.2 Accidental symmetries and chiral algebra: simple examples
The unicorn operator in a minimal model
Consider a LG theory that flows to an Ak (2,2) minimal model with central charge c/3 = k/(k + 2). This has a (0,2) Lagrangian with N = n and W = k+1. The unicorn operator is U = , and its R-charge q = 1/(k + 2) satisfies the bound q  c/3. More generally, we consider operators of the form

Ul = 23 · · · l-1 .

(3.14)

These remain Q-closed, but such an operator with more than k  insertions will violate unitarity. How does the minimal model avoid this? The explanation is simple: all of the putative non-unitary operators are trivial in cohomology. Observe that

Q ·  = -(k + 1)k ,

Q · 2 = -k(k + 1)k-1 .

(3.15)

Continuing in the same way, we find that all operators of the form Um = k+1-m2 · · · m-1
are Q-exact, and setting m = k + 1, we see that all Ul with l  k are Q-exact.

(3.16)

­ 22 ­

The example illustrates a mechanism by which some potential violations of unitarity are avoided in the chiral algebra: the operators that would naively lead to violation of unitarity are not in cohomology. This is a familiar feature from studies of the (c,c) ring of (2,2) LG theories, as well as the B/2 ring of (0,2) LG theories. We make some comments on these features in appendix B.

Accidental symmetry for an irrelevant deformation
We now give an example where an accidental symmetry explains the seeming non-unitarity of the unicorn operator. Our test-case has N = n = 2 with ideal

W = 21 , 22 + 221 .

(3.17)

This ideal has k = 1, and if we assume Vuv = Vir, we obtain

familiar one:

W = 21, 22 ,

(3.21)

i.e. a product of two decoupled A1 minimal models, and we expect that in the IR the theory will simply flow to the decoupled product with central charge c = 2/3 > 3/5.
This expectation can be verified by studying Vir. We find a two-dimensional space of abelian currents in H, spanned by linear combinations of

assignments and the expected central charge of a product of minimal models. Indeed, in

H2,0,0 we can find two commuting spin­2 currents T 1,2, so that the OPEs of T 1, J1 and

T 2, J2 generate two commuting KMV algebras. This is consistent with the expectation that

the IR theory factors into a product.

In fact, we can do better by picking a different basis for the free fields generating H:

1 ,

1 := 1 ,

1 := 1 + 22 ,

1 := 1 ,

2 ,

2 := 2 + 21 ,

2 := 2 ,

2 := 2 - 21 .

(3.24)

The fields in the first line have trivial OPEs with fields in the second line, and, moreover, the fields in each line have the OPEs of a standard free multiplet, i.e. (2.19). In terms of these fields the currents are

so that H is isomorphic to the chiral algebra of the product of minimal models. The change of variables is just a special instance of a holomorphic field redefinition in a LG theory.
The example also illustrates a right-moving enhancement: the diagonal supercurrent multiplet which has Q and Q as the  and  components is a sum of two commuting supercurrent multiplets of the two minimal models. In this case there is also left-moving supersymmetry, and it has a beautiful realization in H [10].

3.3 An N = 3, n = 2 example
Next, we reconsider a more involved example of a family of RG flows with accidental symmetries studied in [20]. In that work we used holomorphic field redefinitions to uncover the accidental symmetries. We will now obtain the same results based solely on the structure of spin­1 currents in H.

Here the I are the redefined fermi multiplets I = J J JI . We can check that J3 is not Q-exact: it is associated with a chiral field, but (3.37) shows that it is not holomorphic.
Next, we consider the low energy theory when  is not invertible. If  has rank 1 or less,
the theory is singular (the ideal fails to be zero-dimensional), so the remaining case is  of
rank 2. The theory then has a free fermi field, and it is convenient to choose our basis for  so that this is 3. In terms of the chiral algebra this is the statement that : 33 : is a holomorphic current with an associated holomorphic spin­2 current. We will ignore this free field in what follows. The remaining N = n = 2 theory is determined by a 2× 3 matrix, which we continue to denote by . The construction of H1,0,0 proceeds in much the same way, with
the fermi indices now taking only two values. Equation (3.31) now gives six linear equations
in the seven variables m, B. This has a solution for generic (rank 2) , determining

J 1 = - : 11 : -3 : 22 : -6 : 11 : -6 : 22 : .

(3.38)

Normalizing this, and choosing a diagonal basis for the fermi fields, we find the charges and

Finally, we can ask when there is an additional solution to (3.31) for a rank-2 matrix . Any non-singular theory requires 11 = 0, and using that to simplify the algebra we find that an additional solution requires the vanishing of

D = (1223 - 1322)  ,

(3.40)

where

is the discriminant whose vanishing implies W is not zero-dimensional. When the first factor in D vanishes, there is an additional spin­1 class in H1,0,0 represented by

In fact, in this case there is also an additional holomorphic spin­2 current; the IR theory further factors into a product of two (2,2) minimal models (and a free fermi field).
We see that a perturbation of the last (most degenerate) case can be chosen to flow to the previous (generic free fermion) case, from which a perturbation takes us to the generic case. For no  do we in fact find c = 3. Thus, we see that the results obtained in [20] are consistent with the structure of the chiral algebra.

4 Non-compact theories from zero-dimensional ideals

As we have seen, when the IR dynamics is determined by a compact, unitary SCFT, the chiral algebra provides a powerful tool to partially characterize the properties of this SCFT. If the chiral algebra is not consistent with the constraints of unitarity, the assumptions underlying the calculations above must be re-examined. Here we present two examples of this phenomenon. In the first example we will see that, while the chiral algebra is incompatible with a compact unitary SCFT, we can nevertheless have a plausible description of the IR fixed points. We have not been able to give such a description in our second example.

4.1 A moduli stack with bad orbits We discussed in the introduction the topological quotient

M = {Muv \ 0} /G ,

(4.1)

as a description of the IR fixed points and pointed out three subtle aspects of such a description: the quotient is not a separated space, and the quotient topology fails to separate orbits that correspond to distinct IR physics; there can be additional IR equivalences: two distinct orbits can flow to the same IR fixed point; finally, 0 may not be full discriminant of the theory. The example we discuss next will illustrate the first two issues, and the second example, we believe, demonstrates the last feature.
Consider a theory with N = n = 2 and ideal generators

W1 = 41 + a122 ,

W2 = 52 + b612 + c3132 .

(4.2)

This is the most general ideal consistent with the given leading monomials 41  W1, 52  W2 and preserving a quasi-homogeneity relation with 3q1 = 2q2. So, for this family Muv = C3, with the three affine coordinates (a, b, c). The ideal is zero-dimensional when the combination
of parameters z = a(c - ab) = 1, i.e. 0 = {z = 1}. To study the quotient, we consider the most general holomorphic field redefinitions consis-
tent with the UV symmetries. A convenient presentation is given in terms of three parameters, 1, 2  C and   C:

1  11 , 2  22 , 1  -1 4(1 + 61-2 42122) . 2  -2 52 , (4.3)

Under this action the parameters (a, b, c) transform to

(a, b, c)  (-1a, 2(b + ), (c + a)) ,

(4.4)

where  = 31-2 2. The group of field redefinitions that acts on the parameter space is therefore

­ 28 ­

G = C  C, with elements (, ) and group multiplication given by (2, 2) · (1, 1) = (21, 2 + 2-11) .
We can choose the parameter  to set b = 0, and with this partial fixing we find M = C2 \ {ac = 1} /C ,

(4.5) (4.6)

where the C action is

(a, c)  (-1a, c) .

(4.7)

M is a non-separated space, and it is important to keep track of its stack structure. Generic C-orbits are labeled by the non-zero value of the invariant z = ac, but z = 0 corresponds to
three distinct orbits:

O(i) = { a = 0, c = 0 }; O(ii) = {a = 0, c = 0 }; O(iii) = { a = 0, c = 0}.

(4.8)

The first orbit has dimension zero and corresponds to a product of two minimal models. The second orbit has dimension one and also has a simple interpretation from the point of view of the minimal model product: turning on a = 0 can be interpreted as adding a relevant deformation to the minimal model product that breaks the UV symmetry U(1)2  U(1), and it is not surprising that the resulting theory should have a lower central charge and smaller KMV algebra. These expectations are verified by studying the chiral algebra for these values of the parameters.
The last orbit is the most surprising one. Using the minimal model R-charge assignments, the operator corresponding c = 0 is clearly irrelevant, so we expect to recover the minimal model product in the IR.16 And thus, if the IR limit µ  0 were smooth, H should be isomorphic to the chiral algebra of the minimal model product. Studying the chiral algebra in detail shows that this is not the case for parameters belonging to O(iii): we find Vuv = Vir, and the central charge is identical to that of O(ii). It is also easy to see that the chiral algebra obtained from O(iii) is not isomorphic to that of O(ii).17
The appearance of O(iii) raises a number of puzzles. For example, we expect that there is a family of SCFTs labeled by the parameter z, and z = 0 appears to be a smooth point in that family. If both O(ii) and O(iii) belong to z = 0, then it appears that the z = 0 limit in the SCFT moduli space is ambiguous.
As we will now argue, the chiral algebra for O(iii) is not consistent with unitarity con-
16This interpretation is consistent with the conjectural description of the IR given in [20]. 17For instance, for either orbit H0,2q1,2q1 is one-dimensional and generated by 21, but while on O(iii) the operator 21 is nilpotent, it is not nilpotent on O(ii).

­ 29 ­

straints of the SCFT. Therefore, the IR physics must be different from the naive description
based on the chiral algebra. A plausible explanation is that theories belonging to O(iii), like those belonging to O(i), flow to the minimal model product SCFT, while the theories parameterized by z = 1, including the orbit O(ii) at z = 0, flow to a family of SCFTs that realize the structure of the UV chiral algebra.

Non-unitarity for the O(iii) orbit
Working at generic z and using the unique symmetry in Vir, we obtain the following charge assignments for the fields:

(4.9)

The unicorn operator has charge qU = 1/2 < c/3. However, we can look at the unitarity bounds for a more general class of operators Um1,m2 = m1 1 m2 2 12.
The quotient ring RW has dimension 20, and a basis can be taken to be

21 ,

31 ,

2 , 12 , 212 , 312 ,

22 , 122 , 2122 , 3122 ,

42 , 142 , 2142 , 3142 ,

(4.10)

where we underlined the monomials that can potentially lead to Um1,m2 that violates the unitarity bound qir  c/3. Every Um1,m2 is Q-closed, but some of these operators are in the image of Q. A Q-exact Um1,m2 must be of the form Q · X, with

2

X=

a,b=1

(4.11)

We find

Q · X = 12 f 11W2,1 + f 12W2,2 - f 21W1,1 - f 22W1,2 - g1W1 - g2W2 .

(4.12)

Working with the ideal at b = 0, i.e. with

W1 = 41 + a122 ,

W2 = 52 + c3132 ,

(4.13)

we can see that when a = 0 all potential Um1,m2 that could violate the unitarity bound are

­ 30 ­

Q-exact. In detail, taking f 22 and f 12 to be the only non-zero components, we have

Q · X = 12 f 12(542 + 3c3122) - 2af 2212 .

(4.14)

If we set f 12 = 0, and f 22 = 1m1-1m2 2 , we eliminate all underlined Um1,m2 with m1 > 0 from

cohomology.

On the other hand, when a = 0 we find

Q · X = 12 3cf 112132 + f 12(542 + 3c3122) - 431f 21 - g1W1 - g2W2 ,

(4.15)

and we see that there is no way to obtain U1,3 = 13212 in the image of Q.

4.2 A rigid example with a unitarity-violating unicorn
In the previous example we saw the orbit O(iii) for which the chiral algebra was not consistent with a unitary compact SCFT. However, we had a natural guess for the IR fixed point: the minimal model product that could be realized in the same Muv as any point in O(iii). We now present an example where such a guess is unavailable because M consists of a single orbit.
We consider a family of models with N = n = 3 and the superpotential interaction

W = 112 + 2 32 + 13 + 3 23 + p1

(4.16)

labeled by the integer p  2. These theories have k = 1, and if we assume that Vir = Vuv, the charges are given by

­ 31 ­

and qU > c/3 for p > 5. To investigate this further, we will now assume p + 2  7 is prime.18 We will show that,
unlike our previous examples with an apparent unitarity violation, the cohomology group H1,0,0 is one-dimensional: Vir = Vuv. Assuming that the theory flows at low energies to a compact SCFT leads to a contradiction: the chiral algebra constructed in the UV using free
field OPEs cannot possibly be the chiral algebra of a unitary compact SCFT.
The restriction that p + 2 is prime guarantees that the only holomorphic redefinitions consistent with quasi-homogeneity are re-scalings of the chiral fields: a  aa and A  AA. Moreover, the potential W is rigid: the monomials shown are the only ones that are
consistent with quasi-homogeneity, and all of them must be present in order for the ideal
to be zero-dimensional. Any zero-dimensional ideal consistent with this quasi-homogeneity
relation can be brought to the canonical form in (4.16) by a holomorphic field redefinition.
The claims of the previous paragraph follow by straightforward numerological considera-
tions. We will not give all of these manipulations here but just list two to give the reader the flavor of the simple manipulations involved. Consider, for example, a monomial n11n22n33 that can show up in a field redefinition of 3:

3 = 13 + 2n1 1 n2 2n3 3 + · · · .

(4.21)

Quasi-homogeneity requires n3 = 0 and

6n1 + (p + 2)n2 = 3p .

(4.22)

We rewrite this as

(3 - n2)(p + 2) = 6(n1 + 1)

(4.23)

so that n2  {0, 1, 2}. But, each of these possibilities is inconsistent with p + 2 being prime. As a second example, consider a field redefinition of the form

1 = 11 + 2n1 1 n2 2n3 3 3 + · · · .

(4.24)

This requires

6p - (p + 8) = 6n1 + (p + 2)n2 + 3pn3 ,

(4.25)

which we rearrange as

(5 - n2 - 3n3)(p + 2) = 6(n1 + 3 - n3) .

(4.26)

That is only possible if n1 = n3 - 3 + l(p + 2) for some integer l. Plugging that into the
18We suspect our results hold more generally, but since this technical assumption already yields an infinite family of theories, we will stick to this subclass.

­ 32 ­

relation leads to n2 = 5 - 3n3 - 6l, which can only be satisfied if l  0. But now, combining our expressions for n1 and n2, we have 3n1 + n2 = 3lp - 4  0, which is a contradiction.
Following in the same vein, we establish all of the assertions for the potential and redefinitions in this class of theories.
This restricts J to the simple form

3

3

J = Aa : aa : + BA : AA :

a=1

A=1

(4.27)

with some constants Aa and BA associated to linear rotations of the chiral fields. Up to an overall normalization, the only Q-closed combination is then given by taking the coefficients to be the charges qir in (4.17).
If the theory with p = 11, for example, flows to a unitary compact SCFT, then the unicorn operator U  H must correspond to a chiral primary field of spin 3/2, and there must be an operator Tir in H that represents the left-moving energy-momentum tensor of the SCFT. We showed that Tir exists and is the unique spin--2 operator consistent with the KMV algebra Vir. Thus, the R-charge of U qU is determined by (2.41), while c = c is determined from the TirTir OPE; the two take the values quoted in (4.20,4.19), and qU > c/3. So, irrespective of any possible non-abelian enhancements or extra right-moving spin--1 currents, we see that for p = 11 the chiral algebra of the model is inconsistent with a compact unitary SCFT.
The case p = 5 is marginal, in the sense that qU = c/3. This does not explicitly violate the unicorn bound. As discussed above, however, a field with this charge is related by spectral flow to a holomorphic field. In the case at hand, this predicts a holomorphic spin­9/2 field of charges (qir, qir) = (-3, 0). We can indeed construct such a field. Since this is holomorphic, a unitary theory requires the existence of a conjugate spin­9/2 field of charges (3, 0). An explicit calculation shows no cohomology exists at these charges, showing that the marginal p = 5 case also cannot flow to a unitary, compact SCFT.
Before speculating on how our model fails to flow to a compact, unitary SCFT, it is wise to check our technical assumptions. We assumed, for example, that for k = 1 the leftmoving weights are determined by Tir with  given by (2.56). If there are other spin­2 fields in cohomology, it is conceivable that we have misidentified which of them represents T . To check this, we explicitly constructed H2,0,0 for p = 11 and for p = 5. We verified that in each case this is three-dimensional and is spanned by Tir, J, and : JJ : as expected. Tir is the unique combination that combines with J to a KMV algebra Vir.

5 Discussion
In this work we studied the chiral algebra of (0,2) LG theories. We obtained a number of results under the assumption that a LG theory specified by a zero-dimensional quasihomogeneous ideal flows to a compact unitary SCFT in the IR. In particular, we found a KacMoody-Virasoro subalgebra Vir of the chiral algebra and a representative of the holomorphic

­ 33 ­

energy momentum tensor Tir. When the µ  0 limit of the chiral algebra is smooth, so that this structure matches the chiral algebra of the IR SCFT, these results give us a great deal of information about the fixed point theory.
In a number of examples we saw that all of this machinery is consistent with expectations and constraints that arise from unitarity of the SCFT. Nevertheless, we also obtained a troubling result: there are models in our class that cannot flow to compact SCFTs that realize this chiral algebra structure. Our understanding of this is rather crude: we studied special operators U  HN/2 and the consequences of the bound qU  c/3. We found examples where the chiral algebra predicts qU > c/3.
Our results used the assumptions of compactness, supersymmetry, and unitarity of the IR theory. Since our UV theory is defined by an asymptotically free Lagrangian, we expect the IR limit to be unitary. It seems unlikely that supersymmetry is broken in this class of theories: there is an R multiplet along the flow, and spontaneous symmetry breaking would be inconsistent with the non-zero elliptic genus. On the other hand, compactness can perhaps be violated through the details of the D-terms, over which we have no control. If the IR theory is not compact, then it is no longer true that symmetries must be realized by Kac-Moody currents, and most of our results would no longer hold.
We can understand this at the level of the chiral algebra as follows. While the holomorphic renormalization scheme we assume will preserve the algebraic structure of H along the RG flow, the normalization of the operators in H is not similarly protected, since the two-point function inevitably involves the product of chiral and anti-chiral operators. If we normalize the operators so that the two-point function takes a canonical form at scale µ, it might be that some of the operators are scaled to zero as µ  0, and the chiral algebra, when rewritten in terms of the rescaled operators, might take a different form as µ  0. For example, it is conceivable that some of the terms in W, when re-expressed in the normalized fields, are scaled to zero as µ  0. When this happens it is possible that either there are new symmetries that emerge in the IR (this would account for the puzzles of the example in section 4.1), or the spin zero chiral ring becomes infinite-dimensional (this would signal non-compactness and account for the puzzle of the example in section 4.2).
In either case, the resolution of the unitarity puzzles seen in the chiral algebra seems to require tools that involve non-chiral quantities, whether it be control over the D-terms of the Lagrangian theory, or computation of the renormalized two-point functions.
We expect that in general qU  c/3 is just the first of many non-trivial unitarity conditions. It is conceivable that the chiral algebra of a theory may satisfy all unitarity conditions for operators of some spin s < Smin but exhibit a failure for some operator O  HSmin, and it is conceivable that Smin grows with N or n. It should also be clear that the unitarity violations we have seen will be a fairly generic phenomenon. For example, most N = n = 2 theories consistent with our assumptions exhibit the puzzles of the example in section 4.1: there are orbits like O(iii) that correspond to seemingly irrelevant deformations of a known theory, yet the chiral algebra does not match the known theory.
It would be interesting to find a finite set of conditions on W with fixed n and N that
­ 34 ­

would guarantee a unitary spectrum, but even such a set of conditions would merely provide necessary conditions for the fixed point to be a compact unitary SCFT. We are thus led to important questions: given a (0,2) LG theory specified by an ideal W, what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for this theory to flow to a compact unitary SCFT that realizes the LG chiral algebra? if a (0,2) LG theory does not satisfy these conditions, what is its low energy limit?
These questions also apply to other seemingly well-behaved (0,2) Lagrangian theories such as the linear sigma models; answering them is a prerequisite to extending the successes of seemingly similar (2,2) renormalization group flows to the (0,2) setting, but they require new tools.

A Diagonal R-symmetry action

Let W  C[1, . . . , n] be a zero-dimensional quasi-homogeneous ideal with the property that no variable a appears linearly in any generator of W.19 Suppose that the quotient ring
RW = C[1, . . . , n]/W admits an R-symmetry action

a = ia(1, . . . , n)  C[1, . . . , n]

(A.1)

with the following properties:

1. the action preserves the ideal: if g  W, then g  W;

2. the R-symmetry acts as a linear diagonalizable operator on RW; 3. the linear action is compatible with the product in the quotient ring;

4. there is a one-dimensional invariant subspace;

5. the remaining eigenvalues are positive;

6. the action preserves the unique vacuum: a|=0 = 0 for all a.
With apologies to commutative algebra artisans, we will prove the following theorem: it is possible to find a polynomial change of variables

a = fa(1, . . . , n)

such that the R-symmetry has a diagonal action on the a. Before launching into the details of the proof, we will comment on the list of properties
we expect of . If our theory flows to a compact SCFT, then the vector space underlying the quotient ring RW is isomorphic to the Hilbert space of spin zero chiral primary states in the SCFT. The R-symmetry action preserves this subspace of the full Hilbert space and

must be represented by a linear diagonalizable action  that has a one-dimensional invariant subspace corresponding to the unique SL(2, C) vacuum. Unitarity requires that the remaining eigenvalues of  be positive, and compatibility with the OPE requires  to act as a derivation with respect to multiplication in RW. This is enough to argue that  has a lift to an action  on C[1, . . . , n] with the first 5 properties claimed above.
The last property, that the lift preserves the unique vacuum configuration  = 0, is an extra condition. We will impose it since without it it seems difficult to provide a description of the IR physics in terms of the UV fields. At any rate, such a description would require some information beyond the superpotential couplings encoded in the ideal W.

Proof of theorem We use the R-symmetry action to grade the vector space RW:

RW = R0  Rq1  Rq2  · · ·  Rqt ,

(A.3)

with R0 = C, and 0 < q1 < q2 < · · · < qt. Because the ideal is zero-dimensional, the set of {qi} is finite, and in particular there is a smallest charge q1. We also define the corresponding filtration by setting

F qi = Rqi  Rqi+1  · · ·  Rqt ,

(A.4)

so that Fqi+1  Fqi . Multiplication in the ring respects this filtration: if [Pi]  Fqi and [Pj]  Fqj , then [PiPj]  Fqi+qj . Here we used the notation that for any polynomial P , [P ] denotes its equivalence class in RW.
Any polynomial P can be written as

P = c + vaa + G ,
a

(A.5)

where c and va are constants, while G is non-linear in the a. The R-symmetry action a = a has a similar expansion, but our assumption 6 requires the constant term to be absent, so that

a = a = Rabb + Fa ,
b

(A.6)

where Rab is a constant matrix and Fa is non-linear in the a. With this notation it is easy to see that if [P ]  Rq with q > 0, then it must be that c = 0, and the vector v is an eigenvector
of the matrix R.
Every variable a can also be expanded according to the grading. More precisely, we can find polynomials qai  C[1, . . . , n] with [qai]  Rqi , such that

a = Ca + qa1 + qa2 + · · · + qat mod W .

(A.7)

­ 36 ­

The constants Ca must be zero: our ideal is quasi-homogeneous and zero-dimensional and
has no linear terms in its generators, which means for every a there is an integer k > 1 so that ka  W. Since the qai are R-symmetry eigenstates, by our previous statement it must be that

qai =

vai bb + Gia ,

b

(A.8)

where the Gia are non-linear, and the vai are eigenvectors of the matrix R with eigenvalue qi. But now, coming back to (A.7) and taking the linear terms, which must vanish by themselves,
we find

a = vai bb .
b,i

(A.9)

This can only hold if the eigenvectors vai of R span Cn, i.e. R is diagonalizable. We can then make a linear change of variables so that in the new variables the R-symmetry action is

a = aa + Fa ,

(A.10)

where the a denote the eigenvalues of the matrix R. Plugging this back into (A.7) rewritten in the new variables, we find that vai b(b - qi) = 0, so that for qi = b we have aqi = Gia, and

aa = a -

Gia mod W .

i,qi=a

(A.11)

Improving the variables
For each a let ra denote the R-charge such that [a]  Fra but [a]  Fq with q > ra. We can order the variables so that r1  r2  · · ·  rn. From our considerations above, whenever a > ra, then the decomposition of a has the form

a = raa + · · · + aa + · · · + qat mod W .

(A.12)

From our previous results we know that each qai with qi < a is non-linear in the variables, and by our filtration considerations, we can choose a representative for aqi that only depends on variables b with rb < qi. We will now argue inductively that we can make a change of variables so that all such terms are absent and ra = a.
Find the smallest ra for which a > ra. For each such variable

a = Fa + aa + · · · mod W ,

(A.13)

where Fa is a nonlinear function of the variables that only depends on variables b with

­ 37 ­

rb = b < ra. For each such a we make a change of variables

a = a - Fa ,

(A.14)

while leaving the b with rb = b < ra unchanged. This is clearly invertible, and the new variables a will satisfy a = ra .
Now repeating this procedure as necessary up to the maximum ra, we obtain the desired result: a new set of variables a  Fa with 1  2  · · ·  n.
Now when written in terms of the new variables it follows that

aa = a + Ga ,

(A.15)

where the filtration implies that the non-linear polynomial Ga can only depend on variables b with b < a. That means the change of variables

a = a + Ga(1, . . . , a-1)

(A.16)

is invertible, and the new variables have R-symmetry transformation

a = aa mod W .

(A.17)

This is our desired result: there is a holomorphic change of variables a = a(1, . . . , n) so that in cohomology the R-symmetry action can be taken to be a = aa.

Extension to Q cohomology at spin­1/2 for N = n
Similar considerations apply to H1/2, the Q cohomology at spin 1/2: this space must admit a diagonalizable R-symmetry action. We will show that for N = n this implies that we can make a holomorphic field redefinition

A = fAB()B ,

(A.18)

so that A are eigenstates of the R-symmetry action. There are two sorts of terms that can potentially appear in H1/2: A gA()A and
A hA()A. Note that these must be separately Q-closed. When N = n, a Q-closed operator of the second type must be Q-exact: as we discuss in appendix B, if this is not the
case, then W cannot be zero-dimensional. Thus, H1/2 is spanned by operators O[f ] = A fA()A. Modding out by Q-exact terms
leads to an equivalence relation

n

N

fA  fA + WA,bgb() + hBA()WB .

b=1

B=1

This ensures that H1/2 is finite-dimensional when W is zero-dimensional.

(A.19)

­ 38 ­

We now grade H1/2 by the R-symmetry action as before:

H1/2 = Rq1  Rq2  · · ·  Rqt ,

(A.20)

with 0  q1 < q2 < · · · < qt. Because the cohomology is finite-dimensional, the set of {qi} is finite, and there is a minimum charge q1. We also define the Fqi as in (A.4).
In fact, q1 is positive. Otherwise H1/2 contains an R-neutral spin­1/2 operator , i.e. a holomorphic fermion. In a unitary CFT this operator must have a holomorphic conjugate 
with

(z)(w)



1 z-w

,

(A.21)

and  must also belong to the chiral algebra. However, in our free field representation, the only possibility for such an operator is  = A hA()A, and we already argued these to be absent when W is zero-dimensional. So, q1 > 0.
Since we assume that there are no linear terms in our ideal generators (i.e. no mass terms), each field A is non-trivial in H1/2 and has an expansion in terms of R-symmetry
eigenstates:

A = A,q1 + A,q2 + · · · + A,qt mod W ,

(A.22)

and the R-symmetry action has a lift  with

A = (RBA + MBA())B ,
B

(A.23)

where R is a constant N × N matrix, while MBA depends on the a. These statements are true modulo Q-exact terms, but because the generators WA have no terms linear in the a all Q-exact terms have -dependent coefficients. In what follows, we work at the level of
cohomology and leave any Q-exact terms implicit. It is then easy to repeat the argument that by a linear change of variables on the A we
can take RBA to be diagonal, so that

A = AA + MBA()B ,
B

(A.24)

and

A,A = A + GAB()B ,
B

(A.25)

while A,qi with qi = A have no -independent terms. As before we find charges rA so that A belongs to F rA but not to Fq for q > rA, and
we can argue once again that after a change of variables and reordering according to the rA,

­ 39 ­

we have

A,A = A +

GAB()B .

B<A

(A.26)

Clearly the change of variables A = A,A is invertible and yields the desired eigenstates A of the R-symmetry action, with A = AA .

B Koszul homology

In this appendix we make some comments on unitarity in the B/2 ring of the (0,2) LG theory
encoded by the Koszul homology associated to the ideal W.
Consider the sub-sector of H consisting of fields constructed purely from the a. This generates all fields in H0 and has algebraic description as the quotient ring

RW = C[1, . . . , n]/W .

(B.1)

For a zero-dimensional W this is a finite-dimensional vector space, and when graded by the R-symmetry, it must have a field of top degree. Assuming that we work with a as eigenstates of (Jir, Jir), we expect that for N = n the top charge should be qir = qir = c/3. It is easy to write down an operator that saturates the bound and represents the unit spectral flow operator:

O

=

det
a,b

Wa,b

,

(B.2)

has charges q = q = c/3 and for any zero-dimensional W, O = 0  RW [37]. Moreover, RW has dimension 1 at top degree [38].
More generally, for any N  n we can consider operators of the form

O[] = A1···Ak ()A1 · · · Ak .

(B.3)

Taking Q-cohomology, this set of operators leads to the Koszul homology Hk(K·, W) of the ideal W that is isomorphic to the B/2 topological heterotic ring of the theory [4, 39, 40]. It follows that H0(K·, W) = RW. When W is zero-dimensional, commutative algebra results [41, 42] show that

0

for k > N - n

Hk(K·, W) =

non-zero

. for k = N - n

Since we have a non-chiral spectral flow even in theories with N > n, we expect that HN-n(K·, W) is one-dimensional and related to spectral flow of the identity. It is not hard

­ 40 ­

to construct a representative: set k = N - n and take O[] with

A1···Ak =

QA1 QA2 · · · QAk A1···AkB1···Bn WB1,1WB2,2 · · · WBn,n ,

B1 ,...,Bn

(B.4)

where  is the usual fully anti-symmetric rank N tensor. It is easy to show that Q · O[] = 0, and we expect this operator to generate HN-n(K·, W), but we are not aware of a purely algebraic proof of this statement.

C Holomorphic symmetry currents for N = n

A holomorphic current J may in principle have terms charged with respect to U(1)R,uv, in which case the most general spin­1 candidate operator has the form

n

N

J = : Aa()a : +

BAB() : AB :

a=1

A,B=1

n

N

+ Ca()a +

DAB()AB + EABAB .

a=1

A,B=1

(C.1)

We will now argue that the each term in the second line must be absent when N = n. Since the Q action is graded by U(1)R,uv, each term in the second line must be separately
Q-closed. The C­term must be zero by exactly the same argument as before: it is inconsistent with J having R-charge 0. As we discussed in appendix B, the E­term must be Q-exact when N = n: otherwise the ideal W cannot be zero dimensional.
It remains to rule out the D­term. As we showed in the last section of appendix A, when N = n and the ideal is zero-dimensional, there is a holomorphic field redefinition

N

A =

FAB () B

B=1

(C.2)

to fields A that are R-symmetry eigenstates. Writing the D­term in terms of the a and A fields, and using the positivity of the R-charge for chiral primary states, we conclude that
the D­term must be absent. Thus, when N = n, every holomorphic symmetry J must have a representative in H1 of
the form (2.35), and its closure is again equivalent to a holomorphic symmetry of the potential
W as in (2.37).

D Explicitly Calculating Neutral Cohomology
To check the possibility that the chiral algebra contains a spin-2 holomorphic current that might serve as Tir and invalidate our conclusion that the chiral algebra is inconsistent with a

­ 41 ­

compact, unitary SCFT determining the IR physics, we performed an explicit calculation of the cohomology groups Hs,,0 = quvHs,quv,0 of Q for 0  s  2 for the models of 4.2 with p = 5 and p = 11. The calculation proceeded as follows:

1. All monomials in a, A, A with spin 0  s  5/2 and non-positive q were tabulated (monomials of degree higher than one in a given fermi field included suitable derivatives).

2. For each value of S in this range and for each of the monomials with s  S and S - s  Z, its products with all monomials in a with charge -q were tabulated, and
all terms obtained from these by introducing S - s holomorphic derivatives listed. This produced the vector spaces V S,,0 of neutral monomials in fields and their derivatives
with spin S for 0  S  5/2 of dimensions DS = (1, 5, 15, 48, 131, 347).

3. The action of Q on each of these monomials was directly evaluated, allowing the determination of the matrix implementing the action Q : V S,,0  V S-1/2,,0. We find
matrices of rank rS = (0, 5, 9, 39, 89).

4. These are consistent with dimensions hS = (1, 0, 1, 0, 3) for the cohomology groups in question. To verify this we explicitly found a basis for

ker Q  QT : V S,,0  V S,,0  V S-1/2,,0  V S+1/2,,0 .

(D.1)

We verified that the cohomology is concentrated at quv = 0 and is spanned by the expected currents J at S = 1, and by T , J, and : JJ : at S = 2.
