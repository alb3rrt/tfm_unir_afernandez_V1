The Brinkman equation has found great popularity in modelling the interfacial flow between free fluid and a porous medium. However, it is still unclear how to determine an appropriate effective Brinkman viscosity without resolving the flow at the pore scale. Here, we propose to determine the Brinkman viscosity for rough porous media from the interface slip length and the interior permeability. Both slip and permeability can be determined from unit-cell analysis, thus enabling an a priori estimate of the effective viscosity. By comparing the velocity distribution in the porous material predicted from the Brinkman equation with that obtained from pore-scale resolved simulations, we show that modelling errors are  10% and not larger than 40%. We highlight the physical origins of the obtained errors and demonstrate that the Brinkman model can be much more accurate for irregular porous structures.

1. Introduction
Flows over porous surfaces are encountered in a wide range of natural and industrial settings. For example, organisms use porous layers to gain unique capabilities such as self-cleaning, insect trapping, and enhanced locomotion (Yang et al. 2014; Kramer 1962; Carpenter et al. 2000; Bandyopadhyay & Hellum 2014; Zhao et al. 2018). The features of the interface that separates the overlaying free-flowing fluid and the porous layer play a vital role in many applications such as soft tissue generation, nutrient exchange, chemical reaction and filtering (Podichetty & Madihally 2014; Stephanopoulos & Tsiveriotis 1989; Grenz et al. 2000). Observations of these naturally occurring phenomena and the many interesting emerging applications have recently lead to extensive efforts to model the interaction between porous media and free flows (Carraro et al. 2013, 2018; L¯acis & Bagheri 2017; L¯acis et al. 2020; Angot et al. 2017; Nakshatrala & Joshaghani 2019; Zampogna et al. 2019; Bottaro 2019; Eggenweiler & Rybak 2021).
The challenge of modelling the flow over porous material stems from describing the exact pore-scale geometry of the solid material and corresponding influence on flow above it. Porous structures in nature span a wide range in complexity and functionality (Liu & Jiang 2011). The range of length scales encountered in the porous structures and associated flow within the material can become prohibitive for direct numerical simulations (Keyes et al. 2013). Effective models relax this requirement and provide a macroscopic description of the porous media that in turn depends on the macroscopic properties of the material.

is a common choice. Here, u and p are macroscale flow and pressure fields, K is the

permeability tensor, µf is the fluid viscosity and µb is the Brinkman or effective viscosity. We define the ratio of Brinkman and fluid viscosities as µ = µb/µf . This model was originally proposed by Brinkman (1949) as an empirical extension of seminal Darcy's

law (Darcy 1856). Darcy's law has been derived using various theoretical approaches

(Whitaker 1998; Mei & Vernescu 2010) as a leading order description of seepage in

bulk porous media. The Brinkman equation has also been obtained through statistical

formulations (Tam 1969; Lundgren 1972). In multi-scale expansion, the Brinkman term

appears as a second-order correction (Auriault et al. 2005).

The Brinkman term, in theory, should be neglected for porous materials with realistic

solid content. However, the Brinkman model has remained a popular choice for practi-

tioners working on turbulent flows (Rosti et al. 2015; G´omez-de Segura & Garc´ia-Mayoral

2019), tissue modelling (Podichetty & Madihally 2014), and porous gels (Feng & Young

2020). The main reasons behind the wide adoption are the practical advantages of the

Brinkman model. These are the ability to accommodate the no-slip condition at the wall

and straightforward coupling with standard Navier-Stokes equations. The theoretically

sound Darcy's law has an intrinsic slip at the solid boundaries and also requires more

complex coupling with free fluid (L¯acis & Bagheri 2017; L¯acis et al. 2020; Sudhakar et al.

2021). However, the practical advantages of the Brinkman model are tied with two issues.

First, despite the straightforward coupling, there is no universal choice for the physical

form of boundary conditions. The existing options range from stress continuity (Martys

et al. 1994; Zampogna & Bottaro 2016), different types of stress jump (Angot et al. 2017;

Lu et al. 2019) to a combination of velocity and stress jumps (L¯acis et al. 2020; Sudhakar

et al. 2021). The second issue is an uncertainty of the Brinkman viscosity µb, which also is the main focus of the current work.

It is generally accepted that in the limit of small ratio between solid volume and total

volume, , the Brinkman viscosity should equal the fluid viscosity (Auriault 2009). This

has often led practitioners of the Brinkman equation to assume µ = 1 (Stephanopoulos

& Tsiveriotis 1989; Podichetty & Madihally 2014; G´omez-de Segura & Garc´ia-Mayoral

2019). However, Brinkman himself wrote (Brinkman 1949) that "the factor µb ... may be different than µf ". For larger  one encounters a vast range of the Brinkman viscosity values. Levy and Auriault (L´evy 1983; Auriault et al. 2005; Auriault 2009) argued

that the assumptions behind the Brinkman equation derivation limit its application to

exceedingly sparse porous domains. As such, the interaction between particles would

be negligible and the Brinkman viscosity should always equal the fluid viscosity. Angot

et al. (2017) proposed that the Brinkman equation is valid for all solid volume fractions

and the Brinkman term would simply become negligible for dense porous domains. Most

theoretical attempts to determine the effective viscosity (Brinkman 1949; Koplik et al.

1983; Ochoa-Tapia & Whitaker 1995; Starov & Zhdanov 2001; Freed & Muthukumar

1978) have focused on sparse porous materials.

simulations with the solution from coupled Stokes-Brinkman problem. They found µ as a decreasing function of . Martys et al. (1994) computed the flow in porous media built using randomly overlapping spheres for pressure and shear driven cases. They obtained µ always greater than unity and observed decaying towards unity for decreasing . It was also stated that "good fits" were obtained for 0.2 <  < 0.5. However, a quantitative characterisation was lacking. Kolodziej et al. (2016) simulated Couette flow in domains filled with regular circular cylinders. They found µ always less than unity. More recently, Zaripov et al. (2019) investigated pressure-driven porous channel flows containing either square or circular cylinders. This is the first study we are aware of where a quantitative evaluation of the Brinkman equation accuracy is reported alongside the effective viscosity. They also demonstrate that a parameter 2 = k µ, where k is a measure of permeability, remains roughly constant over a wide range of solid volume fractions. However, Zaripov et al. (2019) only consider pressure-driven flow in the interior of porous material and compute the error in velocity flux ­ a single integral measure for each simulation.
It is clear that the value of Brinkman viscosity, in particular for configurations consisting of porous material and free fluid, is still an openly debated question. The currently proposed µ values from the literature are presented in figure 1(a) with expressions and authors contained in the legend. The reported µ values span a wide range and it is unclear how to choose µ. In this work, it is proposed to obtain the effective viscosity µ through a scaling estimate. To estimate µ, we focus on the Brinkman term alone and consider a configuration driven only by shear (p = 0). From equation (1.1) we observe that the Brinkman term must balance the Darcy dissipation term. We write

(1.2)

where uc is some characteristic velocity and is some characteristic length. This estimate has been previously employed by Auriault (2009) to discuss the validity of the Brinkman equation. Auriault (2009) concluded that the Brinkman equation is valid for vanishing

solid volume fractions. Contrary, we show that this estimate can be useful also for large

solid volume fractions. From the estimate (1.2), it can be argued that the effective

viscosity µ should be expressed as

2
µ=C k,

(1.3)

where C is dimensionless constant of order unity, as will be discussed later. We will verify

this viscosity estimate by matching pore-scale resolved simulations with predictions from

the Brinkman model. In theory, for the estimate (1.3) to be fully compatible with a

macroscale description, the length scale should be a macroscopic length scale. However,

we set the length scale to = s, where s is the Navier-slip length (Navier 1823; L¯acis et al. 2020; Sudhakar et al. 2021) of the porous material. This yields a good collapse

of the Brinkman viscosity for all the rough porous geometries we have considered, see

figure 1(b). As a result, the proposed scaling (1.3) can be a useful tool for obtaining

the effective viscosity for a given practical problem. However, the slip length s is itself microscopic quantity. Therefore the Brinkman model in this parameter regime should be

viewed as an ad-hoc model. Consequently, a practitioner has to take into account the

accuracy limitations, which we also demonstrate in this work.

The paper is organized as follows. In §2, we describe the flow configuration used

both for pore-scale resolved simulations and the effective simulations. In §3, we describe

porous surface classification in smooth and rough ones. In §4, we provide guidelines

for applying the Brinkman equation to practical problems, including discussion about

interface conditions. Finally, we provide concluding remarks in §5.

2. Matching direct numerical simulations with the Brinkman model
To obtain the effective viscosity µ, we consider a one-dimensional channel flow. We investigate the flow driven by moving top wall, as well as the flow driven by pressure gradient along the channel.

2.1. Pore-scale resolved flow fields

The chosen flow geometry is shown in figure 2(a). The porous domain is constructed from representative element volumes (REV) depicted with dashed lines in figure 2(b). The solid volume fraction  for a porous material is defined as

=

,

p

(2.1)

where a is the solid cylinder cross section area and

the

REV.

The

circular

cylinder area is a = r2, where r is the circle radius. For the other porous geometries the

appropriate cross-section area, a, is used in equation (2.1). We investigate seven different

porous geometries as shown in figure 2(e) and summarized in table 1.

We assume that the flow is sufficiently slow such that it can be described by the Stokes

equations,

p = µf u + f ,  · u = 0,

(2.2) (2.3)

where f is a volume force. Solutions to the Stokes equations are computed using the finite element code FreeFem++ (Hecht 2012). The velocity is solved with quadratic (P2) elements and pressure with linear (P1) elements. The computational domain is defined by a single column of the porous structure as shown in figure 2(d). A single column represents

a complete solution since the flow structures are smaller than the computational domain. Periodic boundary condition is imposed on the vertical boundaries of the domain. Velocity u is prescribed at the upper boundary. No-slip condition is applied to the cylinder surfaces (c) and bottom of the domain. For the shear driven flow, Ut = U , f = (0, 0) while for pressure driven flow, Ut = 0, f = (µf U/ 2p, 0). Here, U is a characteristic velocity scale. Pore-scale solutions were checked for mesh dependence. Doubling the mesh resolution resulted in effective viscosity values changing by less than 2%.
In figure 3, we show streamlines of the pore-scale solutions for several . Streamlines are shown for velocity larger than 10-5 U . For small  only minor deflections of streamlines are observed. Increasing  leads to larger curvature in the streamlines. The curved streamlines illustrate that both velocity components exist in pore-scale flow. Recirculation zones are observed for both driving mechanisms. In the shear driven flow (figure 3a) a rapid velocity decay is observed, in particular for the largest two solid volume fractions. In the pressure-driven flow (figure 3b), on the other hand, there is a finite Darcy flow inside the porous material.
For a fair comparison between pore-scale (DNS) resolved velocity and the Brinkman model, the DNS velocity field must be averaged. The appropriate averaging of the pore-scale flow field is still an open question. In the current work, we choose to use a combination of plane and volume averages. In the interior of the domain, we compute volume averages over each REV. This is analogous to how Darcy's law is derived through homogenisation (Mei & Vernescu 2010) or the method of volume-averaging (Whitaker 1998). However, the flow velocity undergoes rapid change near the free-fluid interface. To capture this, we have chosen to gradually transition from the volume average in the interior to the plane average near the free fluid. The transition is implemented through a sequence of continuously shrinking volume averages. The location of the last volume averaged data point is exactly in the midpoint between the first and second solid cylinder. The location of the first plane averaged data point is at the centre of the uppermost solid cylinder. In figure 4(a,b), we show the location and shape of each averaging window. Obtained averaged DNS data points up are shown with open circles in figure 4(c).

2.2. Velocity distributions from Brinkman model
To obtain the velocity distribution by solving the Brinkman equation (1.1), we need values of permeability tensor and effective viscosity. We compute the permeability tensor on a single REV by using a unit-cell problem (Whitaker 1998) exposing the REV (figure 2b) to volume forcing along all coordinate directions. The effective viscosity µ is left as a free parameter.
Streamlines of the DNS (figure 3) are symmetric with respect to the vertical centre line. Therefore the average vertical velocity is zero. This results in a 1D macroscopic flow configuration. The Brinkman equation (1.1) simplifies to a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the streamwise velocity,

(2.4)

where px is an externally imposed constant driving pressure gradient. Equation (2.4) is exact for isotropic structures and a reasonably good approximation also for anisotropic porous structures (appendix A). Two boundary conditions are needed to close the Brinkman model (2.4). The first condition is set at the interface with the free fluid. There, velocity is set to slip velocity ux = us. We obtain us directly from DNS simulations to mimic velocity continuity condition. The other condition is set at the centre of the second REV from the bottom. This shift from the physical wall ensures no influence of the bottom wall on the fitted µ. There, velocity is set to ux = -Kxxpx/µf , i.e. the interior (Darcy) velocity. The analytical solution to equation (2.4) with the prescribed boundary conditions is

2.3. Brinkman viscosity fit
The Brinkman velocity (2.5) contains one unknown, namely, µ. We use this as a free parameter to obtain the best match between DNS and the Brinkman model. The best match is obtained by minimizing the error in the 2-norm,

Figure 5: Macroscale velocity profiles (ub), gradually averaged (up) and plane-averaged velocity profiles from DNS for circular cylinder porous geometries in (a) shear and (b) pressure driven configurations. The insets show negative velocities from DNS and up.
Here, up (the averaged pore-scale solution) and ub (solution to (2.5)) are evaluated at y = y1, . . . , yN with N = 100. In figure 4(c), we present three Brinkman velocity solutions obtained with three different values for µ. We observe that larger µ reduces the velocity decay rate. In other words, larger Brinkman viscosity allows more efficient macroscale shear stress transfer towards the interior of the porous media. Finally, in figure 4(d) we show the error E as a function of µ, where we observe Emin  7% at µ = 1.81. The other µ values (corresponding velocity profiles in figure 4c) have E  30%.
We apply this minimisation procedure to the porous geometries shown in figure 2(e) for different solid volume fractions. Velocity distributions for several circular cylinder solid volume fractions are presented in figure 5. Three velocity profiles are given for each case; the Brinkman solution (blue solid), the plane averaged pore-scale solution (red dashed) and the combined plane and volume-averaged profile (blue circles). In figure 5(a), we show the velocity profile for shear driven configurations. The plane-averaged DNS profiles exhibit linear regions of velocity decay between the solid structures for small solid volume fractions. For  0.2 recirculation zones appear (figure 3) resulting in a region with negative streamwise velocity (see insets in figure 5).
In figure 5(b), we show the corresponding pressure-driven velocity profiles. The porescale flow field has an oscillatory pattern. The velocity is larger in the void and smaller near the solids, which is a characteristic of Darcy flow. The averaged pore-scale and Brinkman velocity profiles show a uniform velocity in the interior, corresponding to Darcy flow. Again, for  0.2 recirculation occurs near the interface between the free fluid and porous domain.

Figure 6: Effective viscosity (a,c) and velocity L2 error norm (b,d) in shear driven (a,b) and pressure-driven (c,d) flow configurations.
The best-fit effective viscosity µ and associated error E are summarized in figure 6. The viscosity ratio µ as a function of  for shear driven simulations is reported in figure 6(a). We observe that µ obtains values both larger and smaller than unity. For small , all geometries have µ  2.4. The viscosity ratio µ begins to be geometry dependent for  > 10-1, where a sharp increase in effective viscosity is observed. The square, flipped equilateral triangle and flipped right triangle (S1-S3) geometries show an increase in effective viscosity for larger  compared to the other geometries. The corresponding E as a function of  is shown in figure 6(b). The error of the velocity profile for small  is of the order of 10-2. There is an intermediate maximum in E that occurs around   10-2. For large , two distinct trends in E are observed. An unbounded growth of E with increasing  is observed for the S1-S3 geometries. The remaining geometries (R1-R4) show saturation of E. The best-fit viscosity µ for pressure-driven flows is shown in figure 6(c). Trends are the same as for shear-driven flow (figure 6a). However, for small  the viscosity saturates at µ  4.5. The error E for pressure-driven simulations is reported in figure 6(d). Again, there is an intermediate peak in E for   10-2. For larger , the error E exhibits growth for S1-S3 geometries and reduction for R1-R4. This is qualitatively the same as observed in shear driven simulations (figure 6b).
3. Porous surface classification and scaling
In this section, we propose a classification of the considered porous geometries. First, we report the slip length for all structures. Based on the slip length, we divide the geometries into smooth and rough. Then we discuss the scaling of Brinkman viscosity for the rough porous media.

3.1. Smooth and rough porous surfaces

We classify geometries presented in this study into two categories. To start, we can

characterize porous structures visually. Consider the geometries in the right column of

figure 2(e), S1-S3. The top surface of the solid inclusions (that face the free fluid) is flat

and aligned with the x-axis. One may argue that these porous structures are "smooth".

At the largest , for which solids do not overlap, the structures touch each other.

Consequently, these geometries would form a smooth, uninterrupted solid surface. The

smooth porous surfaces exhibited unbounded growth of velocity profile error (figure 6b,d).

Second, we look at the geometries in the left column of figure 2(e), R1-R4. The surfaces

at the top do not align with the x-axis and we may refer to these materials as "rough".

In the limit of maximum , these geometries form an impermeable rough surface. The

error E for rough structures exhibit a saturation (figure 6b,d). For each geometry, we

report the corresponding category in table 1.

A more quantitative distinction between rough and smooth porous surfaces is provided

through the Navier-slip length, s, which is defined by the Navier-slip condition, us =

problem

(L¯acis

&

Bagheri 2017), but here we extract it from computing the slip velocity us and the normal

shear du/dy from DNS. Figure 7(a) shows s as a function of permeability Kxx. To

have an increasing  on the x-axis, we have chosen to represent decreasing Kxx on the

x-axis. We observe that the smooth surfaces have a continuously decaying slip length

(approaching a smooth no-slip surface). On other hand, rough surfaces exhibit a limiting

slip value as permeability tends to zero. For large permeabilities (small solid volume fractions,  < 10-2) there is no clear distinction between the two types. The vertical grey area in figure 7 show transition in . All data to the left have  < 10-2. Contrary, all data to the right have  > 10-2. The Kxx value at  = 10-2 differ between various
porous geometries. Therefore finite thickness region is required to define this boundary, corresponding to the maximum and minimum Kxx value at  = 10-2.

To define a criterion for distinguishing between the two categories, we propose using a

particular scale separation. We defineit as a ratio between the permeability associated length scale and the slip length = Kxx/ s. The scale separation as a function of permeability Kxx is shown in figure 7(b). Here,  4 seems to be a suitable boundary between the two types of surfaces. The porous surface is considered rough if < 4 and

smooth otherwise. Note that < 4 can be rewritten in terms of effective viscosity estimate (1.3). By using C = 1, we have µ = 2sKx-x1 = -2. Then < 4 is equivalent to µ-1/2 < 4 or µ > 1/16.

3.2. Scaling of the Brinkman viscosity
The scaling estimate µ = C 2sKx-x1 for effective viscosity (1.2) was obtained in §1 by balancing Brinkman and Darcy terms. In figure 8, we present the viscosity ratio µ normalised by C( s/ p)2 for all geometries. For the rough surfaces, shown in figure 8(a), we observe that scaled viscosity curves show good collapse when slip length is selected as the relevant length scale. The data collapse deteriorates as   10-2 is approached. The proportionality constants required for collapse are C  O(1) for all considered geometries. The exact coefficient values are provided in the legend of figure 8(a). On the other hand, the porous surfaces classified as smooth do not collapse with the same scaling (figure 8b). The relevant length scale that would allow for an estimate of effective viscosity for smooth surfaces has not yet been identified and is left for future work.

4. Discussion In this section, we discuss the accuracy one can expect by using the Brinkman model
following the guidelines presented in this work. We also put our work in the context of the theoretical limit of µ = 1. And finally, we discuss issues related to the universality of the Brinkman model.
4.1. Guidelines for using Brinkman equation We propose to estimate the effective viscosity in the Brinkman model from the presented scaling estimate µ = C 2sKx-x1 (1.2). Input parameters are slip length and permeability. These quantities are readily available from simple unit cell computations (L¯acis

& Bagheri 2017) or experiments. If possible, the proportionality constant C could be

obtained by fitting the Brinkman model to experiments for one value of . If the fit is

prohibitive, one may assume C = 1. To justify the use of C = 1, we compare the errors

associated with the best fit viscosity and the viscosity obtained through the scaling law

increase in the magnitude of the error. When it comes to practically relevant porous

media ( > 0.01), E  10% - 15% for pressure-driven configurations while for shear-

driven configurations maximum errors are around 30% - 35%.

We have assumed velocity continuity between the porous media and the free fluid. To

fully define the coupled problem, a stress boundary condition is also required. Although

this boundary condition is not investigated in detail in the current work, in what follows,

we discuss our results in the context of stress condition. A stress jump condition can be

written as p · n = R · ( · n). Here, p is the pore fluid stress tensor,  is the free fluid stress tensor and R is a stress ratio tensor defining the free fluid stress transfer to pore fluid (L¯acis 2019). Stress ratio tensor of unity R = I corresponds to stress continuity. For the one-dimensional channel flow, we have only the tangential stress component and the stress jump condition simplifies to

To predict the stress ratio Rxx, we estimate the normal shear in free fluid and pore fluid. We focus on the shear-driven configuration. The free-fluid shear can be estimated using

(4.4)

Here, it is important to recognise that  depends only on the slip length s. This is reasonable because the proposed scaling applies only to rough porous surfaces. Near

the interface with the free fluid, rough surfaces can be characterised by slip length s

alone. This is a similar observation as done by Zaripov et al. (2019). They argued that

2 = k µ is roughly constant. In our notation, this corresponds to 2 =

2 s

being

constant.

Similar exponential decay of velocity profile has been used previously to model the flow

above rough surfaces (Liou & Lu 2009; Yang et al. 2016). We further note the following

important consequence of (4.4): For very dense materials, the permeability tends to zero,

Kxx  0. In order to ensure constant  = s for such materials, µ has to be very large. In the limit of rough impermeable surface (Kxx  0), µ   is required to obtain  = s. Consequently, large µ values can be expected for rough porous surfaces. This explains

the exponential increase of µ observed in this work (figures 1b;6a,c;8a).

By inserting (4.4) in (4.3) and then inserting (4.2,4.3) into (4.1) we obtain

(4.5)

Here, we have used p = µb du/dy and  = µf du/dy. From equations (4.5) and (4.1),

we observe that a continuous velocity derivative is predicted. We evaluate p from the Brinkman model with best fit viscosity and compute  from DNS. Finally, we plot the

constant of order one. We can confirm the scaling and the continuity of the velocity

derivative.

4.2. Modelling error
In this section, we discuss the accuracy one can expect when using the Brinkman model. There are two main sources for error (figure 6b,d). The first is a step-wise change in the slope of linear velocity segments (figure 5a,  = 0.02). The exponential form

of the Brinkman solution (2.5) cannot accommodate these step changes using a single decay rate. This results in a Brinkman velocity profile that is smeared out and an over- or under- prediction of the pore-scale solution. The second source of error is the recirculation that may occur near the interface. Consequently, there is a negative streamwise velocity (figure 5a,  = 0.4). The exponential form of the Brinkman solution is not capable of capturing negative velocity. This introduces an inevitable error in the modelled velocity profile.
The error definition used in this work (2.6) is based on the shape of the velocity distribution. Alternative approaches for selecting the effective viscosity are possible. For example, one can minimize the error in flux

E=

0 d

ubdy
0 d

-

0 d

updy

updy

.

(4.6)

This approach has been used by Zaripov et al. (2019). The choice of mass flux error leads to quantitatively different µ as cancellations in E occur. Consequently, the error in mass flux is expected to be smaller than the error in velocity distribution. To illustrate this, in figure 11 we present µ for circular cylinders obtained by using the two error definitions. We observe similar trends in effective viscosity (figure 11a) . The minimisation of the mass flux allows for a much smaller modelling error (figure 11b) compared to minimising (2.6). The error is less than 2% over the considered  range.
Finally, we discuss the difference between the shear driven and pressure-driven configurations. We observe (figure 6a,c) insignificant differences in µ for large . In this regime, Kxx is very small. This in turn renders the pressure term in equation (2.5) negligible. In other words, the permeability is so small that the effect of porosity is not felt. However, for small  values the spread of viscosity data is more visible (figure 8a). There is a difference between best viscosity for shear and pressure-driven flows.

4.3. Brinkman viscosity of unity
In this section, we discuss the value of effective viscosity µ as  approaches zero. Existing theoretical studies (Einstein 1956; Freed & Muthukumar 1978; Ochoa-Tapia & Whitaker 1995; Starov & Zhdanov 2001) all predict µ = 1 in this limit. The effective

Figure 12: Effective viscosity (b) and modelling error (c) for the interior of porous material. Red dashed line shows the boundary of the interior domain (a).
viscosity in figure 6a,c show a clear deviation from µ = 1. We observe that the asymptotic limits are µ = 2.4 for the shear driven and µ = 4.5 for the pressure-driven configurations. To understand the cause of this difference, we investigate the flow only in the interior of the porous media. With a dashed red line in figure 12(a), we show the boundary below which we expect only interior flow. We truncate the Brinkman solution (2.5) to exclude the region closest to the interface. We impose the averaged velocity measured from the shear driven DNS at the red dashed line (figure 12a) as the boundary condition for the truncated Brinkman solution. Then, we find µ for the interior by carrying out the same fitting procedure as described in §2. The obtained µ as a function of  is shown in figure 12(b). Note that we obtain µ only for  < 0.01. For  > 0.01 the velocity below the red dashed line is vanishingly small and obtaining µ is not possible. Also, note that the obtained variation in µ exhibits significant differences from the existing theoretical predictions (Einstein 1956; Starov & Zhdanov 2001; Ochoa-Tapia & Whitaker 1995; Freed & Muthukumar 1978). All the literature predictions are indistinguishable from each other in the solid volume fraction range 10-5 <  < 10-2, therefore we show only one curve in figure 12(b). Despite the difference from theory, the Brinkman equation proves to be an excellent model for the interior domain. In our µ fit for the interior, we observe very small modelling errors (figure 12c).
4.4. Irregular geometry
The recirculation and the linearity of the velocity profile are suppressed in porous geometries that have an irregular structure. To demonstrate this, we consider a porous material constructed from circular cylinders with various radii (figure 13). In figure 13(a,b), we present streamlines and the velocity profile for  = 0.2. We do not observe any pronounced recirculation. Consequently, there is no negative region in the velocity distribution. The velocity profile for this structure, however, exhibits a much faster velocity decay compared to regular structures. The reason is an increased number of solids within one REV. Despite the rapid decay, the DNS velocity profile is smooth. This profile can be easily captured by the Brinkman model (figure 13b). In figure 13(c), we show the viscosity ratio µ and the velocity profile error E over the considered solid volume fractions. The error is significantly smaller than for regular structures. The maximum E for the irregular configuration is on the order of the minimum E for the regular ones. This indicates that the Brinkman model can be more accurate for irregular porous structures. The effective viscosity exhibits similar trends as for the regular cases. There

is an asymptotic approach to a constant value in the small  limit. For large , the effective viscosity rapidly increases.
It is interesting to understand if the estimate µ = 2sKx-x1 is applicable also for the selected irregular geometry. The viscosity µ from the scaling estimate is shown in figure 13(c) with black dashed lines. The corresponding error E is shown in figure 13(c) with red dashed lines. We observe that the error is larger compared to the error associated with best-fit viscosity. However, it is always below 4% for practically relevant solid volume fractions. This indicates that the scaling µ = 2sKx-x1 is likely to be valid also for rough irregular porous structures. However, additional work is required to draw a more general conclusion.
4.5. Application of the Brinkman model to different flow configurations
In this section, we apply the Brinkman model to a channel filled with a porous material. First, we consider a pressure-driven flow (figure 14a). As the porous material, we use a total of 8 cylinders in the vertical direction at  = 0.05. This also results in a onedimensional flow. The same configuration is investigated by Zaripov et al. (2019). In figure 14(b) we show the line averaged velocity distribution obtained from DNS and predictions from the Brinkman model. For µ, we have used value fitted by Zaripov et al. (2019), µ = 2.17, and the best-fit value from the current work, µ = 0.16. We compute the error in mass flux and obtain 0.06% for µ = 2.17 and 7.56% for µ = 0.16. This clearly illustrates that different Brinkman viscosity is needed to obtain good mass flux prediction in confined pressure-driven flow through porous media.
To further highlight the dependence of µ on the system configuration, we change the driving mechanism. We set the pressure gradient to zero and move the top wall, as shown in figure 14(c). The corresponding DNS and Brinkman velocity profiles with µ = 2.17 and µ = 0.16 are shown in figure 14(d). Computing error in velocity flux yields 62.5% for µ = 2.17 and 55.8% for µ = 0.16. After the change in the driving mechanism of the flow, we observe that neither viscosity value provides an acceptable representation of the velocity flux. Although not demonstrated here, the same sensitivity exists to small changes in distance between the last pore structure and the confining wall both in pressure and in shear-driven porous channel flows.

Figure 14: Pressure driven porous channel flow (a) with corresponding pore-scale and Brinkman solutions (b) with viscosities µ = 2.17 (Zaripov et al. 2019) and µ = 0.16 (this work). In (c,d) the flow is driven through shear instead of the pressure gradient. Circular cylinders with solid volume fraction  = 0.05.
These results serve to demonstrate that the effective viscosity is highly sensitive to the wall location and driving mechanism. This most likely is the culprit that hinders the efforts to obtain universal Brinkman viscosity for a specific porous geometry. One possible reason for this sensitivity could be the value of the permeability near the interface. It has previously been shown that the permeability at the interface with free fluid differs from that of interior (L¯acis & Bagheri 2017). A similar effect could also occur near a solid wall. Another possibility is a limitation of the Brinkman model as an ad-hoc description of macroscale flow. Nevertheless, for a specific geometry and flow configuration, it seems that there exists a µ that provides relatively low modelling errors. In this work, we provide µ for free flow over porous material. For pressure-driven porous channel flow, µ can be found in the work by Zaripov et al. (2019). For flow configuration different than these, a separate investigation would be required.
5. Conclusions In this work, we have proposed to estimate the Brinkman viscosity by µ = 2s/Kxx. We
have shown that the Brinkman model with the proposed µ is suitable to model flows over and through rough porous media. We have provided a quantitative criterion Kxx/ s < 4 (equivalent to µ > 1/16) to distinguish between rough and smooth porous media. The interface between the free fluid and porous media was chosen at the crest plane (the tip of the last solid structures). By considering several different porous geometries, we have demonstrated that the expected error of the Brinkman model for rough porous surfaces remains bounded below approximately 30%, while for smooth porous surfaces the modelling error grows without bound.
We have found that the main cause of error for intermediate   0.02 is the piecewise linear behaviour of the DNS velocity profile. On other hand, for larger   0.1 the main cause of the error is recirculation and negative stream-wise velocity. Both of these effects can not be captured by a simple exponential decay predicted by the Brinkman

18

model. These effects are relevant to the large class of regular porous materials, such as those obtained through 3D printing. We have also demonstrated on one irregular porous geometry that the velocity profile is smoothed and the recirculation is suppressed. Consequently, the modelling error of the Brinkman equation is much smaller. The viscosity scaling µ = 2s/Kxx allowed to obtain effective velocity profiles with error below 4% for  > 0.01.
We have further discussed the consequences of our results for the stress condition at the interface between free fluid and porous material. We have demonstrated that the continuity of du/dy seems the most appropriate boundary condition. In addition, we have noticed that for rough surfaces the exponential decay length is equal to slip length  = s. This leads to very large µ for rough surfaces with very small permeability. We have also discussed the approach of the Brinkman viscosity to fluid viscosity µ = 1 as solid volume fraction approach zero. We have obtained this for interior flow only. Finally, we have compared the Brinkman model and DNS with the µ values obtained in this work and proposed by Zaripov et al. (2019) for porous channel flow. Neither µ value has been successful in capturing flow distribution for the configuration with a moving wall.
Since the accuracy and applicability of the Brinkman model is configuration-specific, further work is required on a range of canonical problems. For the particular configuration of regular rough porous media in contact with free fluid, we have provided a consistent and robust way to determine Brinkman viscosity value. We believe that this work will serve as valuable insight for practitioners that want to continue using the Brinkman model for solving applied flow problems in biology, geology and engineering.

Appendix A. One-dimensional flow for anisotropic porous structures

In this appendix, we demonstrate the full one-dimensional equations for anisotropic structures. We motivate why the same equation as for isotropic porous structures is a sufficiently good approximation. We expand the Brinkman equation (1.1) for onedimensional flow over and through an anisotropic porous material. We get

The horizontal pressure gradient p/x can be understood as a constant externally imposed driving pressure gradient. The vertical pressure gradient p/y can be viewed as a constant constraint ensuring no wall-normal velocity. From the constraint equation, we express the vertical pressure gradient as

The Brinkman viscosity for porous media exposed to free flow

We observe that the effect from the anisotropy of the porous material exhibits itself for the 1D flow as a correction to streamwise permeability. However, the off-diagonal permeability term typically is much smaller than the diagonal terms, Kxy Kxx and Kxy Kyy. We observe that the correction of the streamwise velocity due to the anisotropy of the porous material is quadratic in Kxy. Therefore it is safe to neglect the correction and use the equation (2.4) obtained for isotropic structures even for anisotropic structures.
