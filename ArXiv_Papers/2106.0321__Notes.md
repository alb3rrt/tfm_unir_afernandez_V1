## Abstract

Virtual Reality (VR) has become more and more popular with dropping prices for systems and a growing number of users. However, the issue of accessibility in VR has been hardly addressed so far and no uniform approach or standard exists at this time. In this position paper, we propose a customisable toolkit implemented at the system-level and discuss the potential benefits of this approach and challenges that will need to be overcome for a successful implementation.
