We characterize the maximal discrete subgroups of SO+(2, n + 2), which contain the discriminant kernel of an even lattice, which contains two hyperbolic planes over Z. They coincide with the normalizers in SO+(2, n + 2) and are given by the group of all integral matrices inside SO+(2, n + 2), whenever the underlying lattice is maximal even. Finally we deal with the irreducible root lattices as examples.

1 Introduction
The Hermitian symmetric space associated with the special orthogonal group SO(2, n+2) is a Siegel domain of type IV. The attached spaces of modular forms have attracted a lot of attention, mainly influenced by the product expansions of Borcherds (cf. [1]). Recently a lot of concrete examples for small n have been constructed by Wang and Williams (cf. [17] - [20]). The modular group consists of the discriminant kernel of an even lattice as well as certain congruence subgroups (cf. [10]).
Moreover the Maaß lift or additive lift has been described by Gritsenko (cf. [7], [12]). In a recent paper by Wernz [21] the connection between different notions of Maaß spaces for SO(2, 4) have been reduced to modular forms for the discriminant kernel versus its maximal discrete extension.
In this paper we consider the case of general n. We determine the maximal discrete extension of the discriminant kernel and show that it is equal to the group of all integral matrices inside SO+(2, n + 2), whenever we start with a maximal even lattice with two hyperbolic planes over Z. In this case it also coincides with the normalizer. To a certain extent this characterizes the maximal even lattices among all even lattices.

2 Maximal Even Lattices

We start with an even lattice L in a Q-vector space V of dimension n equipped with a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form ·, · , i.e. L is a free group of rank n satisfying ,   2Z for all   L. The dual lattice is given by
L := {v  V ; v, L  Z}  L

and L/L with the quadratic form

q : L/L  Q/Z,

+L

, 

+ Z,

is called the discriminant group of L. The lattice L is always contained in a maximal even lattice in V , which is a sublattice of L (cf. [11], 14.11).

Throughout the paper we choose a basis of L with Gram matrix S. Let disc L := det S

denote its discriminant. We add two hyperbolic planes, i.e.



(1)

 

L = Zn, S  Zn×n positive definite and even,

L0 = Zn+2, L1 = Zn+4,

S0 = S1 =

001 0 -S 0

,

100

001 0 S0 0

.

Thus S1 has got the signature (2, n + 2). We consider the attached special orthogonal group

SO(S1; R) := {M  SL(n + 4; R); M trS1M = S1}.

Let SO+(S1; R) stand for the connected component of the identity matrix I. Due to (5) in [13], it can be characterized by

Let S := SO+(S1; Z) denote the subgroup of integral matrices. Note that in this case a, d  Zn+2 holds in (2) due to M -1  S and (3). Moreover we define the discriminant
kernel S := {M  S; M  I + Z(n+4)×(n+4)S1},

where I is the identity matrix. The discriminant kernel induces the identity on L1/L1, L1 = S1-1Zn+4. We consider particular matrices in S:

At first we give a description of the first columns of matrices in S.
Theorem 1. Let L1 = Zn+4 satisfy (1). Given h  Zn+4 the following assertions are equivalent:

(i) h is the first column of a matrix in S (resp. S). (ii) htrS1 is the last row of a matrix in S (resp. S). (iii) htrS1h = 0 and gcd(S1h) = 1.

Proof. (i)  (ii) Use (2) and (3). (i)  (iii) Apply M trS1M = S1 and S  S  SL(n + 4; Z).

3

(iii)  (ii) Proceed in the same way as in the proof of Theorem 1 in [13]. The matrices involved there lead to an M  S such that
htrS1M = (0, . . . , 0, 1).
Hence htrS1 is the last row of M -1  S  S. In the context of the action of S on the orthogonal half-space (cf. [7]), it makes sense
to consider cusps. If  is a subgroup of S of finite index, we denote by C0() := h; h  L1 = S1-1Zn+4, htrS1h = 0, gcd(S1h) = 1
the set of -orbits of zero-dimensional cusps (cf. [8]). Corollary 1. Let L1 = Zn+4 satisfy (1). Then the following assertions are equivalent:
(i) L = Zn is maximal even. (ii) Every g  L1 = S1-1Zn+4 with gtrS1g = 0 fulfills g  L1 = Zn+4. (iii) C0(S) = 1. (iv) C0(S) = 1. Proof. (i)  (iv) Let
g = (g1, g2, 1, . . . , n, g3, g4)tr  L1, gtrS1g = 0, gcd(S1g) = 1. Thus  = (1, . . . , n)tr  L follows with
trS = 2(g1g4 + g2g3)  2Z.
Hence L + Z is an even overlattice of L and (i) yields   L, i.e. g  L1. Then Theorem 1 leads to (iv). (iv)  (iii) This is clear due to S  S. (iii)  (ii) S acts transitively on the set of vectors g  L1 with gtrS1g = 0 and gcd(S1g) = 1. In view of S  SL(n + 4; Z) any M  S induces a bijective map M : Zn+4  Zn+4, h  M h. Hence L1 = L1 follows. (ii)  (i) This is clear as any even overlattice of L is contained in L and
{  L#; trS  2Z} = L
Hence L is maximal even. Corollary 1 says that L is maximal even if and only if (L/L, q) is anisotropic. The
equivalence between (i) and (ii) is contained in [15], Proposition 1.4.1, under weaker assumptions.
We give some examples.

Example 1. a) Considering L = Z with x, y = 2N xy, N  N, we obtain a maximal even lattice if and only if N is squarefree. This leads to paramodular groups (cf. [6]).

b) If L = OK is the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic number field K with x, y = xy + xy, we are led to the Hermitian modular group (cf. [14]).

c) Considering the Hurwitz quaternions or the order of integral Cayley numbers, confer [10] and [4]. These cases refer to the root lattices D4 and E8 (cf. sect. 4).

The case of non-maximal lattices is dealt with in the following Remark.

Remark 1. An arbitrary even lattice L is contained in a maximal even lattice L with Gram matrix S. Hence there exists a matrix H  Zn×n satisfying





I 00

S = HtrSH, S1 = HtrS1H, H = 0 H 0 .

00I

Clearly | det H| = [L : L] holds. In this case we have

S  H-1SH  H-1S H  SO+(S1; Q).

Thus L is maximal even, whenever det S is squarefree. If n is odd, then det S and det S are even. Thus L of odd rank is maximal even, whenever (det S)/2 is squarefree.

We give an application to right and double cosets, which is also needed in the attached Hecke theory.

Theorem 2. Let L1 = Zn+4 satisfy (1) and

(6)

R = 1r R  SO+(S1; R), r  N, R  Z(n+4)×(n+4).

If L is maximal even or r and det S are coprime, the following holds.

a) The right coset SR contains a matrix

where  is the gcd of the first column of R.

that

matrix M  S in both cases. Therefore (, 0, . . . , 0)tr is the first column of M -1R.

As block diagonal matrices form a subgroup, we obtain (7) from the description of the

inverse in (3).

b) Let  be the smallest (1, 1)-entry in N of all the matrices in SRS and assume

R=

 

 

without restriction. It follows from a) that  divides the entries of the first column of
R. The same procedure as in a) shows that  also divides the entries of the first row of RS1-1. Multiplication by T,   Zn+2, from the left and by Tµ, µ  Zn+2, from the right (cf. (5)) leads to

R =  0 K 0   SRS,  = r.

Multiplication by T,   Zn+2, from the left, then shows that  divides the entries of K and . Now S  SL(n + 4; Z) implies that  is the gcd of the entries of R.

3 Maximal Discrete Subgroups

We follow the procedure by Ramanathan [16].

Lemma 1. Let L1 = Zn+4 satisfy (1). Let  be a discrete subgroup of SO+(S1; R), which contains S. Then the following holds

a) [ : S] = j  N.

b) Given R  , there exists r  N such that

 rR



Z(n+4)×(n+4).

Proof. a) According to [2], 4.10, the discriminant kernel S possesses a fundamental domain with respect to the action on the orthogonal half-space with finite, positive volume. As  is countable, the index j must be finite.

6

b) Assume the notation (2) for R. Multiplying R by matrices of type (5), we may assume that , , ,  are non-zero. Setting k = j! we conclude

Rk  S for each R  .

This leads to

(RM R-1)k = RM kR-1  S for all M  S.

Using M = T in (5) we get with  = (1, 0, . . . , 0)tr and µ = (0, . . . , 0, 1)tr

whenever x is the first column of R or the last column of R, if we replace T by T. Considering R-1 instead of R this remains true, if xtrS1 is the first or last row of R. If k22 = u2v with u, v  N, v squarefree, we conclude that x is integral for all the vectors x mentioned above, whenever



(9)

 = k/ v.

If we replace R by RT,   Zn+2, we conclude that K, hence R is integral, too. Then

S1

=

1 2

(R)tr

S1

(R)

leads to 2  N.

Due to the determinantal condition, R in Lemma 1 is a rational matrix, whenever n is odd.

Corollary 2. Let L1 = Zn+4 satisfy (1). Then the normalizer of S and S in SO+(S1; R) is equal to S.

Proof. Clearly S is a normal subgroup of S. Given R in the mormalizer of S or S in SO+(S1; R), we conclude from the proof of Lemma 1 and in particular from (9) with k = 1 that 1v R is integral. Then det R = 1 leads to v = 1 and therefore R  S.

Next we consider the particular case of maximal even lattices.

Theorem 3. Let L1 = Zn+4 be a maximal even lattice satisfying (1). Then S is the uniquely determined maximal discrete extension of S in SO+(S1; R).

Proof. Let  be a discrete subgroup of SO+(S1; R), which contains S. Due to Lemma 1 and Theorem 2 we may assume





00

R = 0 K 0  , 0 < 

00

,  = 1,

R



Z(n+4)×(n+4) .

If 0 <  < 1 the right cosets SRm, m  Z, are mutually different. This contradicts Lemma 1. Thus  = 1 and R is integral, i.e. R  S. As S is clearly a discrete group, it is the unique maximal discrete extension of S.
Non-maximal lattices are described in the following Remark.
Remark 2. a) If L is not maximal even, r in Lemma 1 is not always equal to 1. But one can proceed along the proof of Lemma 4 in [14] in order to show that r is always a divisor of (det S)m for some m  N. Now consider Remark 1. Hence H-1SH is a maximal discrete extension of S due to Theorem 3, which is neither contained in SL(n + 4; Z) nor in the normalizer of S or S due to Corollary 2. Note that this maximal discrete extension does not contain S in general. As a maximal even overlattice is not unique in general (cf. [15]), we conclude that a maximal discrete extension S is not uniquely determined in general. More precisely any maximal discrete extension is equal to the normalizer S, if and only if the underlying lattice L is maximal even.
b) Lemma 1 remains true, if we replace the discriminant kernel by an arbitrary congruence subgroup of S .

4 Root Lattices

In this section we deal with root lattices, as they yield the most common examples of Borcherds products (cf. [18]). We quote [3], Chap. 4, and [5], 1.4, for details.
The lattice An is given by
An :=   Zn+1; 1 + . . . + n+1 = 0 , disc An = n + 1.

The discriminant group is cyclic of order n + 1

An/An =

an + An ,

an

=

1 n+1

(ne1

-

e2

-

...

-

en+1),

q(an

+ An)

=

n 2(n+1)

+ Z.

Hence (An/An, q) is anisotropic if and only if 8  (n + 1) and p2  (n + 1) for each odd prime p.

If An is not maximal, its maximal discrete extension is uniquely determined and generated by An and jan with nj2  0 (mod 2(n + 1)). It is equal to
  An; ,   2Z . The lattice Dn is given by
Dn =   Zn; 1 + . . . + n  0 (mod 2) , disc Dn = 4. If n is odd, Dn is maximal even due to Remark 1. If n is even, Dn /Dn is a Kleinian

8

4-group, where the values of q are given by

Z,

1 2

+

Z,

n 8

+

Z,

n 8

+

Z.

Hence Dn is maximal even, if and only if 8  n. If 8 | n, the lattice Dn+ generated by Dn

and

hn

=

1 2

(e1

+

...

+

en)

is

unimodular

and

a

maximal

even

overlattice

of

Dn.

E8 = D8+ is unimodular. E7 = e7 - e8  has disc E7 = 2. E6 = e6 - e7, e7 - e8  satisfies disc E6 = 3. Hence they are maximal even due to Remark 1.

Summarizing we have

Lemma 2. A complete list of maximal even irreducible root lattices is given by
a) An, if n is even and n + 1 is squarefree or if n is odd and (n + 1)/2 is squarefree.
b) Dn, if n is not a multiple of 8. c) E6, E7, E8.

Clearly one can deal with arbitrary root lattices on this basis. There exists a unique overlattice, which is maximal even, for instance, whenever the discriminant group is cyclic, as pointed out for An. But Dn for 8 | n has got two different maximal even overlattices, which are both isometric to Dn+.

Example 2. a) Let L = 4A1. Then S, S = 2I(4), corresponds to the extended modular group over the Lipschitz quaternions and admits a unique maximal discrete extension, which is given by L = D4 and corresponds to the extended modular group over the Hurwitz quaternions (cf. [9]).

b) Let L = 5A1, S = 2I(5). Then there are 5 maximal even overlattices given by Z5+Zhj,

hj

=

1 2

(h

-

ej

),

j

=

1, . . . , 5,

where

h

= (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)tr .

The

associated

maximal

discrete

extensions of S in Remark 2 are isomorphic.

But there is another maximal discrete extension given by S, which is not isomorphic

to the other ones. This can be proved in a similar way as in [10], as one can restrict to

matrices with denominator 2 in the maximal discrete extension and uses the fact that

the matrices

I 00 0P 0 00I

, P  SO(I(5); Z), belong to S.
