In introductory level electromagnetism courses the calculation of electrostatic potential in an arbitrary point is a very common exercise. One of the most viewed cases is the calculation of electrostatic potential in the symmetry axis of a centered ring and it has been widely studied the potential off the axis of a charged ring centered in the origin coordinate. In this work, we calculated the potential in the z axis of a non centered charged ring using elliptic integrals as an pedagogical example of the application of special functions in electromagnetism.

I. INTRODUCTION
TThe calculation of electrostatic potential at an arbitrary point, due to a charge distribution, is a general topic presented to undergraduate students at introductory electromagnetism course [1­3]. Taking advantage of the scalar nature of potential it can calculate the Electric field at an arbitrary point. Typical examples are the calculation of the electrostatic potential of a sphere, a long rod in an arbitrary point, as well as a disk and uniformly charged ring, over a point of his symmetry axes. Nevertheless, in the two last cases when we want to calculate the electrostatic potential at any point of the space off-axis, due to this charge distribution, we must deal with special functions as elliptic integrals [4­7] or Legendre polynomials [8]. In this article, we calculate the electrostatic potential of a non-centered charged ring in the z axis using a suitable parametrization of a circle of radius R. This result allows recovering the well-known expressions for the potential of a centered ring on its symmetry axes and outside of it.

II. ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL ON THE AXIS The electrostatic potential in terms of a charge density is given by [8]

We consider a uniformly charged ring of radius R and uniform charge density  = Q/2R located in the xy plane which is non centered respect to the origin coordinate O as shown in figure (1)

Using the parametric equation of a non centered ring given by x = a + R cos  and y = b + R sin , where (a,b) corresponds to the coordinates of the center of the ring and 0    2. Therefore r = zk^ and r = (a + R cos )^i + (b + R sin )^, so we can obtain the infinitesimal length element by means of

dl =| dr |= (dx )2 + (dy )2 = Rd.

The parameters of equation (6) are defined by  = arctan(/) and  = 2/ sin  = 2 2 + 2 and the variable u =  - . Using the transformation u = 2 we can re write the denominator of equation (6) as

( +  cos u)1/2 = ( + )1/2 1 - m sin2  1/2 ,

where m = 2/( + ). So the equation (6) can be written as

of the parameter m, we can make  = 0 and  = 0 then m = 0. Noticing that K(0) = /2, we have

which is the electrostatic potential in the z axis of a centered ring. As we can see from the figure 2 the normalized electrostatic potential if the center of the ring moves away form the
origin coordinate, the normalized electrostatic potential in the z axis tends to vanish. If we compare this situation with the electrostatic potential, in the space, of a centered ring [4­6], we can consider
that the ring its displaced a distance  = 2 + 2 from the origin coordinate O. Considering  to lie on the plane of the ring along the x direction, then  = 0 so  =  = , where = /R. Therefore, the electrostatic potential is given by

III. CONCLUSIONS
It has been presented a general method to obtain the electrostatic potential using an adequate parametrization of a loop through the use of elliptic integrals. From this result, it could recover the expressions of the electrostatic potential on the symmetry axis of a centered ring. Finally, the obtained results agree with the calculations of the electrostatic potential off the symmetry axis of a centered ring and are useful as a pedagogical exercise for to students can explore special functions in an electromagnetism problem.
