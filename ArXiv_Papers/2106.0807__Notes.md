## Abstract

Our main goal is to develop a representation for finite distributive nearlattices through certain ordered structures. This representation generalizes the well-known representation given by Birkhoff for finite distributive lattices through finite posets. We also study finite distributive nearlattices through the concepts of dual atoms, boolean elements, complemented elements and irreducible elements. We prove that the sets of boolean elements and complemented elements form semi-boolean algebras. We show that the set of boolean elements of a finite distributive lattice is a boolean lattice.
