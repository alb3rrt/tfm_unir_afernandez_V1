Abstract A vertex of a graph is bisimplicial if the set of its neighbors is the union of two cliques; a graph is quasi-line if every vertex is bisimplicial. A recent result of Chudnovsky and Seymour asserts that every non-empty even-hole-free graph has a bisimplicial vertex. Both Hadwiger's conjecture and the Erdos-Lov´asz Tihany conjecture have been shown to be true for quasi-line graphs, but are open for even-hole-free graphs. In this note, we prove that for all k  7, every even-hole-free graph with no Kk minor is (2k - 6)-colorable; every even-hole-free graph G with (G) < (G) = s + t - 1 satisfies the Erdos-Lov´asz Tihany conjecture provided that t  s > (G)/3. Furthermore, we prove that every 9-chromatic graph G with (G)  8 has a K4  K6 minor. Our proofs rely heavily on the structural result of Chudnovsky and Seymour on even-hole-free graphs.
1 Introduction
All graphs in this paper are finite and simple. For a graph G, we use V (G) to denote the vertex set, E(G) the edge set, |G| the number of vertices, e(G) the number of edges, (G) the minimum degree, (G) the maximum degree, (G) the independence number, (G) the clique number and (G) the chromatic number. A graph H is a minor of a graph G if H can be obtained from a subgraph of G by contracting edges. We write G H if H is a minor of G. In those circumstances we also say that G has an H minor. Our work is motivated by the celebrated Hadwiger's conjecture [Had43] and the Erdos-Lov´asz Tihany conjecture [Erd68].
Conjecture 1.1 (Hadwiger's conjecture [Had43]). For every integer k  1, every graph with no Kk minor is (k - 1)-colorable.
Conjecture 1.1 is trivially true for k  3, and reasonably easy for k = 4, as shown independently by Hadwiger [Had43] and Dirac [Dir52]. However, for k  5, Hadwiger's conjecture implies the Four Color Theorem [AH77, AHK77]. Wagner [Wag37] proved that the case k = 5 of Hadwiger's conjecture is, in fact, equivalent to the Four Color Theorem, and the same was shown for k = 6 by Robertson, Seymour and Thomas [RST93]. Despite receiving considerable attention over the years, Hadwiger's conjecture remains wide open for k  7 and is widely considered among the most important problems in graph theory and has motivated numerous developments in graph coloring and graph minor theory.

with no Kk minor is O(k(log log k)6) due to Postle [Pos20], improving a recent breakthrough of Norin, Postle, and the present author [NPS20] who improved a long-standing bound obtained independently by Kostochka [Kos82, Kos84] and Thomason [Tho84]. We refer the reader to a recent survey by Seymour [Sey16] for further background on Conjecture 1.1.
Throughout the paper, let s and t be positive integers. A graph G is (s, t)-splittable if V (G) can be partitioned into two sets S and T such that (G[S])  s and (G[T ])  t. In 1968, Erdos [Erd68] published the following conjecture of Lov´asz, which has since been known as the Erdos-Lov´asz Tihany conjecture.
Conjecture 1.2 (The Erdos-Lov´asz Tihany conjecture). Let G be a graph with (G) < (G) = s + t - 1, where t  s  2 are integers. Then G is (s, t)-splittable.
The case (2, 2) for Conjecture 1.2 is trivial; the cases (2, 3), (3, 3) and (3, 4) were shown by Brown and Jung [BJ69] in 1969; Mozhan [Moz87] and Stiebitz [Sti87] each independently showed the case (2, 4) in 1987; the case (3, 5) was settled by Stiebitz [Sti88] in 1988. Conjecture 1.2 is open for all other cases. A relaxed version of Conjecture 1.2 was proved in [Sti17].
Recent work on both Conjecture 1.1 and Conjecture 1.2 have also focused on proving the conjectures for certain classes of graphs. A vertex of a graph is bisimplicial if the set of its neighbors is the union of two cliques; a graph is quasi-line if every vertex is bisimplicial. Note that every line graph is quasi-line and every quasi-line graph is claw-free [CS12]. A hole in a graph is an induced cycle of length at least four; a hole is even if it has an even length. A graph is even-hole-free if it contains no even hole. Hadwiger's conjecture has been shown to be true for line graphs by Reed and Seymour [RS04]; quasi-line graphs by Chudnovsky and Ovetsky Fradkin [CF08]; graphs G with (G)  3 and no hole of length between 4 and 2(G)- 1 by Thomas and the present author [TS17]. Meanwhile, the Erdos-Lov´asz Tihany conjecture has also been verified to be true for line graphs by Kostochka and Stiebitz [KS08]; quasi-line graphs, and graphs G with (G) = 2 by Balogh, Kostochka, Prince and Stiebitz [BKPS09]; graphs G with (G)  3 and no hole of length between 4 and 2(G) - 1 by the present author [Son19].
Chudnovsky and Seymour [CS19] recently proved a structural result on even-hole-free graphs.
Theorem 1.3 (Chudnovsky and Seymour [CS19]). Let G be a non-empty even-hole-free graph. Then G has a bisimplicial vertex and (G)  2(G) - 1.
It is unknown whether Conjecture 1.1 and Conjecture 1.2 hold for even-hole-free graphs. Using Theorem 1.3, we prove in Section 2 that for all k  7, every even-hole-free graph with no Kk minor is (2k - 6)-colorable; every even-hole-free graph G with (G) < (G) = s + t - 1 satisfies Conjecture 1.2 provided that t  s > (G)/3. It is worth noting that Kawarabayashi, Pedersen and Toft [KPT11] observed that if Hadwiger's conjecture holds, then the following conjecture might be easier to settle than the Erdos-Lov´asz Tihany conjecture.
Conjecture 1.4 (Kawarabayashi, Pedersen, Toft [KPT11]). Every graph G satisfying (G) < (G) = s + t - 1 has two vertex-disjoint subgraphs G1 and G2 such that G1 Ks and G2 Kt, where t  s  2 are integers.

In the same paper [KPT11], they settled Conjecture 1.4 for a few additional values of (s, t)  {(2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5)}. We end Section 2 by proving the (4, 6) case for Conjecture 1.4, that is, we prove that every graph G with (G) = 9 > (G) has a K4  K6 minor. Here K4  K6 denotes the disjoint union of K4 and K6.
We need to introduce more notation. Let G be a graph. For a vertex x  V (G), we will use N (x) to denote the set of vertices in G which are adjacent to x. We define N [x] = N (x)  {x} and d(x) = |N (x)|. Given vertex sets A, B  V (G), we say that A is complete to (resp. anti-complete to) B if for every a  A and every b  B, ab  E(G) (resp. ab / E(G)). The subgraph of G induced by A, denoted G[A], is the graph with vertex set A and edge set {xy  E(G) : x, y  A}. We denote by B \ A the set B - A, and G \ A the subgraph of G induced on V (G) \ A, respectively. If A = {a}, we simply write B \ a and G \ a, respectively. We say that G is k-chromatic if (G) = k. An (s, t)-graph is a connected (s+t-1)-chromatic graph which does not contain two vertex-disjoint subgraphs with chromatic number s and t, respectively. We use the convention "A :=" to mean that A is defined to be the right-hand side of the relation.

Finally, we shall make use of the following results of Stiebitz [Sti88, Sti96] and Mader [Mad68].

Theorem 1.5 (Stiebitz [Sti88]). Suppose G is an (s, t)-graph with t  s  2. If (G)  t, then (G)  s + t - 1.

Theorem 1.6 (Stiebitz [Sti96]). Every graph G satisfying (G)  s + t + 1 has two vertex-disjoint subgraphs G1 and G2 such that (G1)  s and (G2)  t.

Theorem 1.7 (Mader [Mad68]). For every integer p  7, every graph on n  p vertices and at

least (p - 2)n -

p-1 2

+ 1 edges has a Kp minor.

2 Main results

Rolek and the present author [RS17, Theorem 5.2] proved that if Mader's bound in Theorem 1.7 can be generalized to all values of p (as in [RS17, Conjecture 5.1]), then every graph with no Kp minor is (2p - 6)-colorable for all p  7. It is hard to prove [RS17, Conjecture 5.1]. We begin this section with a result on coloring even-hole-free graphs with no Kk minor, where k  7. It seems non-trivial to improve the bound in Theorem 2.1 to 2k - 7.
Theorem 2.1. For each k  7, every even-hole-free graph with no Kk minor is (2k - 6)-colorable.
Proof. Suppose the assertion is false. Let G be an even-hole free graph with no Kk minor and (G)  2k - 5. We choose G with |G| minimum. Then G is vertex-critical and (G) = 2k - 5. Thus (G)  2k - 6; in addition, G is connected and has no clique-cut. It is easy to see that (G)  k - 2, else let K be a Kk-1 subgraph in G, then G \ V (K) is connected because G has no clique-cut; by contracting G \ V (K) into a single vertex we obtain a Kk minor, a contradiction. Note that G is not necessarily contraction-critical as a proper minor of G may contain even holes. We claim that
() 2  (G[N (x)])  d(x) - 2k + 7 for every x  V (G).

3

Proof. Let x  V (G). Since (G)  k - 2 and (G)  2k - 6, we see that (G[N (x)])  2. Suppose (G[N (x)])  d(x) - 2k + 8. Let A be a maximum independent set of G[N (x)]. Let G be obtained from G by contracting G[A{x}] into a single vertex, say w. Note that G has no Kk minor. We next show that G is even-hole-free. Suppose G has an even hole C with vertices v1, . . . , v2m in order for some integer m  2. Since G is even-hole-free, we see that w  V (C). We may assume that w = v2. Then V (C) \ {v1, v2, v3} is anti-complete to A in G. If v1 and v3 have a common neighbor, say v  A, then we obtain an even hole in G with vertices v1, v, v3, . . . , v2m in order, a contradiction. Thus no vertex in A is complete to {v1, v3} in G. Let u, v  A be such that uv1, vv3  E(G). But then u = v and we obtain an even hole in G with vertices v1, u, x, v, v3, . . . , v2m in order, a contradiction. This proves that G is even-hole-free. By the minimality of G, (G)  2k - 6. Recall that |N (x) \ A| = d(x) - |A|  2k - 8. Let c : V (G)  [2k - 6] be a proper (2k - 6)-coloring of G. We may assume that c(N (x) \ A)  [2k - 8] and c(w) = 2k - 7. But then we obtain a proper (2k - 6)-coloring of G from c by coloring all the vertices in A with color 2k - 7 and the vertex x with color 2k - 6, a contradiction. Thus 2  (G[N (x)])  d(x) - 2k + 7, as claimed.
By (), (G)  2k - 5. Since G is even-hole-free, by Theorem 1.3, G has a bisimplicial vertex v such that N (v) is the union of two cliques. It follows that
(G)  1 + (G[N (v)])  1 + d(v)/2  1 + (2k - 5)/2 = k - 1.
contrary to the fact that (G)  k - 2.
We next prove a lemma which plays a key role in the proof of Theorem 2.3 and Theorem 2.4.
Lemma 2.2. Let G be a graph and x  V (G) with p := (G[N (x)])  2. Let V1, . . . , Vp be the color classes of a proper p-coloring of G[N (x)] with |V1|  · · ·  |Vp|  1. If |Vr  · · ·  Vp|  (G) - r - 1 for some r  [p] with 2  r  p, then p  (G) - 2 and G is (r, (G) + 1 - r)-splittable.
Proof. Let G, p, r, V1, . . . , Vp be as given in the statement. Note that p - r + 1  |Vr  · · ·  Vp|  (G) - r - 1 and so p  (G) - 2 and V (G) \ N [x] = . Let W := V1  · · ·  Vr-1. Then (G[{x}  W ]) = r and (G \ W )  (G) - (r - 1) = (G) + 1 - r. It suffices to show that (G \ ({x}  W ))  (G \ W ). Let q := (G \ ({x}  W ))  (G \ W ) - 1  (G) - r  2 and let U1, . . . , Uq be the color classes of a proper q-coloring of G \ ({x}  W ). Since x is adjacent to |Vr  · · ·  Vp|  (G) - r - 1  q - 1 vertices in G \ W , we see that x is anti-complete to Ui for some i  [q]. We may assume that i = 1. Then U1  {x}, U2, . . . , Uq form the color classes of a proper q-coloring of G \ W . Therefore, (G \ ({x}  W )) = q  (G \ W )  (G) - r + 1, as desired.
We are now ready to prove that the Erdos-Lov´asz Tihany conjecture holds for even-hole-free graphs G with (G) < (G) = s + t - 1 if t  s > (G)/3. It would be nice if one can prove the same holds without the additional condition.
Theorem 2.3. Let G be an even-hole-free graph with (G) < (G) = s + t - 1, where t  s  2. If s > (G)/3, then G is (s, t)-splittable.
4

Proof. Suppose the assertion is false. Let G be a counterexample with |G| minimum. Then G is vertex-critical; in addition, G is an (s, t)-graph. Thus (G)  (G)- 1 = s + t - 2. By Theorem 1.5, (G)  t - 1. Since G is even-hole-free, by Theorem 1.3, G has a bisimplicial vertex v such that N (v) is the union of two cliques. Thus (G[N (v)])  2, (G[N (v)])  t - 2 and
s + t - 2 = (G) - 1  (G)  d(v)  2(G[N (v)])  2t - 4.
It follows that t  s + 2  4 and (G) = s + t - 1  2s + 1. We next claim that (G)  |G| - 2. Suppose there exists x  V (G) such that d(x) = |G| - 1. Then
(G \ x) = (G) - 1 = s + (t - 1) - 1 > (G) - 1 = (G \ x) and t - 1 > s > (G \ x)/3.
By the minimality of G, G \ x is (s, t - 1)-splittable and thus G is (s, t)-splittable, a contradiction. Thus (G)  |G| - 2, as claimed. It follows that V (G) \ N [v] =  and so (G[N [v]])  (G) - 1. Let p := (N (v)). Then p = (G[N [v]]) - 1  (G) - 2. Note that
p  (G[N (v)])  d(v)/2  ((G) - 1)/2  ((2s + 1) - 1)/2 = s  2.
Let V1, . . . , Vp be the color classes of a proper p-coloring of G[N (v)] with 2  |V1|  · · ·  |Vp|  1. Suppose p  t - 1. Then |Vt-2| = 1 because d(v)  2t - 4. Therefore,
|Vt  · · ·  Vp| = p - t + 1  ((G) - 2) - t + 1 = (G) - t - 1.
By Lemma 2.2 applied to G and v with r = t, we see that G is (s, t)-splittable, a contradiction. Thus s  p  t - 2. Next, if |Vs  · · ·  Vp|  (G) - s - 1, then G is (s, t)-splittable by applying Lemma 2.2 to G and v with r = s, a contradiction. Hence, |Vs  · · ·  Vp|  (G) - s = t - 1  3. Note that p - s + 1  (t - 2) - 2 + 1 = t - 3, and so |Vs| = 2 and
d(v) = (|V1| + · · · + |Vs-1|) + |Vs  · · ·  Vp|  2(s - 1) + t - 1 = 2s + t - 3.
It follows that t - 2  (G[N (v)])  d(v)/2  (2s + t - 3)/2, which implies that t  2s + 1. Thus (G) = s + t - 1  3s, contrary to the assumption that 3s > (G).
Finally, we prove that Conjecture 1.4 is true when (s, t) = (4, 6).
Theorem 2.4. Every 9-chromatic graph G with (G)  8 has a K4  K6 minor.
Proof. Suppose for a contradiction that G is a counterexample to the statement with minimum number of vertices. Then G is vertex-critical, and so (G)  8 and G is connected. Suppose G contains two vertex-disjoint subgraphs G1 and G2 such that (G1)  4 and (G2)  6. Since Hadwiger's conjecture holds for k-chromatic graphs with k  6, we see that G1 K4 and G2 K6, a contradiction. Thus G is a (4, 6)-graph, and so (G)  5 by Theorem 1.5. Note that G is not necessarily contraction-critical, as a proper minor of G may have clique number 9. We claim that Claim 1. 2  (G[N (x)])  d(x) - 7 for each x  V (G).
5

Proof. Let x  V (G). Since (G)  5 and (G)  8, we see that (G[N (x)])  2. Suppose (G[N (x)])  d(x) - 6. Let A be a maximum independent set of G[N (x)]. Let G be obtained from G by contracting G[A  {x}] into a single vertex, say w. Note that (G) < 8 and G has no K4  K6 minor. By the minimality of G, (G)  8. Let c : V (G)  [8] be a proper 8-coloring of G. Since |N (x) \ A| = d(x) - |A|  6, we may assume that c(N (x) \ A)  [6] and c(w) = 7. But then we obtain a proper 8-coloring of G from c by coloring all the vertices in A with color 7 and the vertex x with color 8, a contradiction. Thus 2  (G[N (x)])  d(x) - 7, as claimed.
By Claim 1, (G)  9. Suppose (G)  13. By Theorem 1.6, G contains two vertex-disjoint subgraphs G1 and G2 such that (G1)  4 and (G2)  8. By Theorem 1.7, we see that G1 K4 and G2 K6, a contradiction. Thus 9  (G)  12. We next claim that
Claim 2. G[N (x)] is even-hole-free and (G[N (x)])  2(G[N (x)]) - 1 for each x  V (G).
Proof. Let x  V (G). Suppose G[N (x)] contains an even hole C. Then (G[V (C)  {x}]) = 3 and so (G \ (V (C)  {x}))  (G) - 3 = 6. It is easy to see that G[V (C)  {x}] K4. Since Hadwiger's conjecture holds for 6-chromatic graphs, we see that G \ (V (C)  {x}) has a K6 minor, and so G has a K4  K6 minor, a contradiction. Thus G[N (x)] is even-hole-free. By Theorem 1.3, (G[N (x)])  2(G[N (x)]) - 1.
Let v  V (G) with d(v) = (G), and let p := (G[N (v)]). Since 9  d(v)  12, we see that p  3 by Claim 1. Suppose G[N (v)] is K3-free. By Claim 2, p  2(G[N (v)]) - 1 = 3. Thus (G[N [v]]) = 4 and (G \ N [v]) = (G \ N (v))  9 - 3 = 6, contrary to the fact that G is a (4, 6)-graph. Thus (G[N (v)])  3. Let v1, v2, v3  N (v) be pairwise adjacent in G and let H := G \ {v, v1, v2, v3}. Then G[{v, v1, v2, v3}] = K4 and
2e(H)  (d(v) - 3)(|G \ N [v]|) + (d(v) - 4) · |N (v) \ {v1, v2, v3}| = (d(v) - 3)(|G| - d(v) - 1) + (d(v) - 4)(d(v) - 3) = (d(v) - 3)(|H| - 1).
Suppose d(v)  {11, 12}. Then 2e(H)  8(|H| - 1). By Theorem 1.7, H K6, and so G has a K4  K6 minor, a contradiction. This proves that 9  d(v)  10. Then p  4 by Claim 1. Since (G[N (v)])  4, we see that G[N (v)] has an anti-matching of size at least three. It follows that 4  p  d(v) - 3. Let V1, . . . , Vp be the color classes of a proper p-coloring of G[N (v)] with |V1|  · · ·  |Vp|  1. If p  {4, 5}, then |V4|  2 because d(v)  10. Thus |V4 · · ·Vp|  4 = (G)-4-1. By Lemma 2.2 applied to G and v with r = 4, we see that G is (4, 6)-splittable, contrary to the fact that G is a (4, 6)-graph. It remains to consider the case 6  p  d(v) - 3. Since d(v)  10, we see that |V5| = 1. Thus |V6  · · ·  Vp| = p - 5  (d(v) - 3) - 5  2 = (G) - 6 - 1. By Lemma 2.2 applied to G and v with r = 6, we see that G is (4, 6)-splittable, a contradiction.
This completes the proof of Theorem 2.4.
