## Abstract

Insight into the electroweak (EW) and Higgs sectors can be achieved through measurements of vector boson scattering (VBS) processes. The scattering of EW bosons are rare processes that are precisely predicted in the Standard Model (SM) and are closely related to the Higgs mechanism. Modifications to VBS processes are also predicted in models of physics beyond the SM (BSM), for example through changes to the Higgs boson couplings to gauge bosons and the resonant production of new particles. In this review, experimental results and theoretical developments of VBS at the Large Hadron Collider, its high luminosity upgrade, and future colliders are presented.
