## Abstract

While studying the viscoelastic flow past an infinite plate with suction and constant heat flux between fluid and plate, Raptis and Tziyanidis gave the solution of a pair of equations for velocity and temperature as functions of distance. They then gave some approximate solutions. This letter shows that the approximations are not justified and presents an exact analytical study.
