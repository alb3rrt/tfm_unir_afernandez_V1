Abstract In this note, we discuss the ellipticity of the single layer boundary integral operator for the wave equation in one space dimension. This result not only generalizes the well-known ellipticity of the energetic boundary integral formulation in L2, but it also turns out to be a particular case of a recent result on the inf-sup stability of boundary integral operators for the wave equation. Instead of the time derivative in the energetic formulation, we use a modified Hilbert transformation, which allows us to stay in Sobolev spaces of the same order. This results in the applicability of standard boundary element error estimates, which are confirmed by numerical results.
1 Introduction
Time-domain boundary integral equations and boundary element methods for the wave equation are well established in the literature; we mention the groundbraking works of Bamberger and Ha Duong [2], Aimi et al. [1], and the review article [4] by Costabel and Sayas. Other works include [5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], to mention a few.
The main difficulties in the numerical analysis of these formulations are in the so-called norm gap, coming from continuity and coercivity estimates in different space-time Sobolev
1

norms. When using the energetic boundary element method, a complete stability and error analysis can be done in L2(), see [8], where  is the lateral boundary of the space-time
domain Q :=  × (0, T ).
Using a generalized inf-sup stable variational formulation [17] for the wave equation, in
[13] we derived inf-sup stability conditions for all boundary integral operators in related
trace spaces. In fact, this work was motivated by our previous result [18] on the spatially
one-dimensional case. When replacing the time derivative in the energetic boundary inte-
gral formulation by a modified Hilbert transformation [15], the resulting composition with
the single layer boundary integral operator becomes elliptic in the natural energy space [H,10/2()], similarly to what is known for boundary integral operators for second-order elliptic partial differential equations. Note that H,10/2() := [H,10(), L2()]1/2 is defined by interpolation, with H,10() = {v  H1() : v(T ) = 0}. Analogously, H01,() covers zero initial conditions, i.e., v(0) = 0.
In this paper, we present a detailed derivation of this new approach, and we discuss the
corresponding numerical analysis of a related new boundary element method. In Section 2,
we recall the energetic space-time boundary integral formulation [1, 8], and we provide a simplified proof of the ellipticity result in L2(). In particular, we obtain that the single layer boundary integral operator V : L2()  H01,() is an isomorphism. Using duality arguments, we obtain that V : [H,10()]  L2() is also an isomorphism. Finally, by an interpolation argument, we conclude that V : [H,10/2()]  H01,/2() is an isomorphism as well. While this implies an inf-sup stability estimate, as also discussed in [13], in Section 3 we introduce a modified Hilbert transformation HT : H01,/2()  H,10/2(), see [15], to establish ellipticity of HT V in [H,10/2()] in Section 4. Although the main result, as given in Lemma 4.1, still involves some unknown constant, Proposition 4.2 gives numerical
evidence on the behavior of the ellipticity constant, which agrees with the constant known
from the energetic formulation. In Section 5, we present some numerical results which
confirm the a priori error estimates, as given in Section 4. In Section 6, we finally draw
some conclusions for future work.

2 Energetic space-time boundary integral equation

As in [1], we consider the Dirichlet boundary value problem for the homogeneous wave

equation in the one-dimensional spatial domain  = (0, L) with zero initial conditions,

and for a given time horizon T > 0,

ttu(x, t) - xxu(x, t) = 0 u(x, 0) = tu(x, t)|t=0 = 0



for (x, t)  Q := (0, L) × (0, T ), for x  (0, L),



u(0, t) = g0(t) for t  (0, T ), u(L, t) = gL(t) for t  (0, T ).

In the one-dimensional case, the fundamental solution of the wave equation is the Heaviside

function

U (x, t)

=

H (t

and we can represent the solution u of (2.1) by using the single layer potential

with the density functions w = (w0, wL). Note that for any function z : (0, T )  R, we set z(t) = 0 for t < 0 or t > T in the remainder of this work. To determine the yet unknown density functions (w0, wL), we consider the boundary integral equations for x  0,

wL(s) ds = gL(t)

for t  (0, T ).

(2.3)

We write the boundary integral equations (2.2) and (2.3) in compact form, for w = (w0, wL), as

(V w)(t) =

(V0w)(t) (VLw)(t)

=

V00 VL0

V0L VLL

w0 wL

(t) =

g0(t) gL(t)

= g(t),

t  (0, T ).

(2.4)

In the energetic boundary element method [1], instead of (2.4), the time derivative of (2.4)

is considered,

t(V w)(t) = tg(t) for t  (0, T ).

for z = (z0, zL)  L2().

Moreover, the energetic bilinear form a(·, ·) is also L2()-elliptic, see [1, Theorem 2.1]. For later reference, we will give a simplified proof of this result. For this, we introduce

n := min m  N : T  mL ,

(2.6)

which is the number of time slices Tj := ((j - 1)L, jL) for j = 1, . . . , n in the case T = nL. In the case T < nL, we define the last time slice as Tn := ((n - 1)L, T ), while all the others remain unchanged.

Theorem 2.1 [1, Theorem 2.1] For all w  L2(), there holds the ellipticity estimate

a(w, w) =

w, tV w

L2()



sin2

 2(n + 1)

w 2L2(),

(2.7)

where the number n  N of time slices is defined in (2.6).

For t  T1, we have t - L < 0, and therefore w0(t - L) = wL(t - L) = 0 follows. For j = 2, . . . , n - 1, we have, using the Cauchy­Schwarz inequality,

From the above properties, we conclude that

tV : L2()  L2()

defines an isomorphism. Since the time derivative

t : H01,()  L2()

is also an isomorphism, e.g., [15, Sect. 2.1], so is

V : L2()  H01,() . Note that, for u = (u0, uL)  H01,() := H01,(0, T ) × H01,(0, T ), we have

(2.8)

u

:=

tu0

+

tuL

2 L2

.

For t : H01,(0, T )  L2(0, T ), the inverse is given by

t
u(t) = (t-1f )(t) = f (s) ds, t  (0, T ), 0

with f  L2(0, T ), u  H01,(0, T ). Analogously, for t : H,10(0, T )  L2(0, T ), we find the inverse as
T
u(t) = (-t 1f )(t) = - f (s) ds, t  (0, T ). t
For w, v  L2() and u = V w = (u0, uL)  H01,(), we therefore obtain

In fact, by the density of L2() in [H,10()], the operator

--t 1V : [H,10()]  H,10()

(2.9)

defines an isomorphism, and so does

V : [H,10()]  L2().

(2.10)

For the single layer boundary integral operator V , we have obtained the mapping properties (2.8) and (2.10), respectively. When applying an interpolation argument, this gives that

V : [H,10/2()]  H01,/2()

is an isomorphism as well, where the Sobolev space H01,/2() = H01,/2(0, T ) × H01,/2(0, T ) is endowed with the Hilbertian norm

z := H01,/2()

1/2

z + z 2 0 H01,/2(0,T )

2 L H01,/2(0,T )

for z = (z0, zL)  H01,/2()

and analogously, the Sobolev space H,10/2() is introduced. Hence, we conclude the inf-sup stability condition

cS

0=v[H01,/2 ()]

| V w, v | v [H01,/2()]

for all w  [H,10/2()]

(2.11)

with a constant cS > 0. In fact, (2.11) corresponds to the inf-sup condition in [13, Theorem
5.7], where the test space is slightly larger than used in (2.11). But we will show that V : [H,10/2()]  H01,/2() in combination with a modified Hilbert transformation [15, 16, 19] even satisfies an ellipticity estimate similar as in (2.7).

As in [15], we introduce the transformation operator HT : L2(0, T )  L2(0, T ) as


HT u(t) := uk cos
k=0

 2

+

k

t T

,

t  (0, T ),

(3.1)

which is norm preserving and bijective. By construction, we have that the transformation operator HT : H01,/2(0, T )  H,10/2(0, T ) is also an isometric isomorphism, and

tu, HT u (0,T ) =

u2 H01,/2(0,T )

for all u  H01,/2(0, T ).

Note that H01,/2(0, T ) := [H01,(0, T ), L2(0, T )]1/2 is constructed by interpolation, where H01,(0, T ) := {v  H1(0, T ) : v(0) = 0}. In the same way, we define H,10/2(0, T ) but with zero condition at the final time t = T . It is easy to see that

| tu, HT z (0,T )| 

u z H01,/2(0,T )

H01,/2(0,T )

for all u, z  H01,/2(0, T ).

(3.2)

The transformation operator HT , as defined in (3.1), allows a closed representation, see [15, Lemma 2.8], which generalizes the well-known Hilbert transformation, e.g., [3]. Moreover, following [16, Eqn. (2.5)] we conclude the following representation for u, z  H01,(0, T ),

tu, HT z

This representation also allows for an efficient evaluation of the bilinear form tu, HT z (0,T ) by using hierarchical matrices, see [16] for a more detailed discussion.

4 A space-time approach in energy spaces
Instead of the boundary integral equation (2.5), we may replace the application of the time derivative by the modified Hilbert transformation HT : H01,/2()  H,10/2(), i.e., we consider the boundary integral equation to find w  [H,10/2()] such that
HT V w = HT g in [H,10/2()],

9

where g  H01,/2() is a given Dirichlet datum. The related bilinear form is given as

aHT (w, v) := v, HT V w  for all v, w  [H,10/2()].

Recall that for u = (u0, uL)  H01,/2(), we have

tu = (tu0, tuL) = (v0, vL) =: v  [H,10/2()] ,

satisfying

u = v . H01,/2()

[H,10/2()]

For v = tu, w = tz with u, z  H01,(), we can write

aHT (w, v)

Proposition 4.2 Numerical results indicate that

where n is given in (2.6). Indeed, for L = 1, T  [1, 20] and m = 20000, the related results are given in Figure 1. Then, the ellipticity estimate (4.1) becomes

aHT (w, w) = HT V w, w   sin2

 2(n + 1)

w2 [H,10/2()]

for all w  [H,10/2()], (4.2)

where the ellipticity constant is the same as in (2.7), and in (2.9), respectively. Hence, we can think of (4.2) being an interpolation of the ellipticity estimates (2.7) and (2.9).

With the above results, we conclude unique solvability of the variational formulation to find w  [H,10/2()] such that

v, HT V w  = v, HT g  for all v  [H,10/2()],

(4.3)

where g  H01,/2() is a given Dirichlet datum. Let Wh  [H,10/2()] be some boundary element space, e.g., of piecewise constant basis functions, which are defined with respect to some decomposition of the lateral boundaries {0} × (0, T ) and {L} × (0, T ), respectively. The space-time Galerkin boundary element formulation of (4.3) is: Find wh  Wh such that
vh, HT V wh  = vh, HT g  for all vh  Wh.
When assuming w  Hs() for some s  [0, 1] and using standard arguments, e.g., [12], we derive an a priori error estimate in the energy norm,

w - wh

Moreover, using an inverse inequality, we also obtain an error estimate in L2(),

w - wh L2()  c hs w Hs().

Instead of the boundary integral equation (2.4) of the indirect approach, we consider, as in [14], the boundary integral equation of the direct approach

(5.1)

including the double layer boundary integral operator K on the right hand side. In this

case, the unknown w is the spatial normal derivative nxu of the solution u of (2.1). For a boundary element approximation, consider a decomposition of the lateral bound-

ary

N0 +NL

into N0 + NL boundary elements i with maximal mesh size h = maxi |i|. Here, N0 is the number of boundary elements for the boundary {0} × (0, T ) and NL is the number of boundary elements for the boundary {L} × (0, T ). The conforming ansatz space of
piecewise constant functions

Sh0() := Sh00(0, T ) × Sh0L(0, T )  [H,10/2()] is used to define an approximate solution wh  Sh0(). Then, the Galerkin discretization

is equivalent to the global linear system

for all vh  Sh0()

(5.2)

Vhw = g

(5.3)

with the related system matrix Vh  R , (N0+NL)×(N0+NL) the right-hand side g  RN0+NL and the vector of unknown coefficients w  RN0+NL of wh  Sh0(). Here, for an easier implementation, we approximate the right-hand side g  H01,/2() by Qhg, where Qh is the L2 projection on the space of piecewise linear, continuous functions fulfilling homogeneous initial conditions for t = 0. The assembling of the matrix Vh  R(N0+NL)×(N0+NL) and the right-hand side g  RN0+NL, i.e., the realization of HT , is done as proposed in [19, Subsection 2.2]. The integrals for computing the projection Qhg are calculated by using high-order quadrature rules. The global linear system (5.3) is solved by a direct solver.
In the numerical examples, we consider the spatial domain  = (0, 3), i.e., L = 3, and
the time interval (0, 6), i.e., T = 6. The lateral boundaries {0} × (0, T ) and {L} × (0, T ) are discretized uniformly into N0 = NL = 2+1 boundary elements each,  = 3, 4, 5, . . . , 12.
In the first example, we consider the smooth solution

u1(x, t) =

(t

-

for x  t  2 + x, otherwise.

Due to w1 = nxu1  H1() and using the error estimate (4.4), we expect a linear order of convergence, as confirmed by the numerical results given in Table 1.

6 Conclusions
In this note, we have shown that the single layer boundary integral operator of the wave equation in one space dimension is elliptic in the energy space [H,10/2()], when composed with some modified Hilbert transformation. This result corresponds to the well-known ellipticity results for boundary integral operators related to second-order elliptic partial differential equations. While this particular result is at this time restricted to the spatially one-dimensional case, in the general case we were already able to establish a related inf-sup stability condition [13] instead. Although this is already sufficient to do a numerical analysis of related boundary element methods, it remains open whether we can prove ellipticity also in the multi-dimensional case. It is obvious that we can extend this approach also to the hypersingular boundary integral operator, and to the double layer boundary integral operator. Ellipticity of boundary integral operators is an important ingredient in the a priori and a posteriori error analysis of boundary element methods, in the construction of appropriate preconditioners, and in the coupling with finite element methods. It goes without saying that this proposed new approach requires more work in the numerical analysis, and in the implementation of the proposed scheme, including the composition of the single layer boundary integral operator and the modified Hilbert transformation, which are both non-local. Nevertheless, this work may give some more insight into the numerical analysis of existing boundary element methods for the wave equation, and it presents an alternative approach for a reliable and efficient numerical solution of the wave equation.
