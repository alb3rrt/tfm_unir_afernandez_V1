Abstract
In this letter we considered the bosonic string action in the presence of metric Gµ , Kalb-Ramond field Bµ and dilaton field . We commented the conditions for quantum conformal invariance using standard approach (all three  functions are zero) and the second one, adding Liouville term to the sigma model action. Analyzing the second one and writing down the effective action, we get Einstein-Hilbert action with some matter and cosmological constant, which is expressed in terms of the central charge of Virasoro algebra. The fact that string theory landscape produces cosmological constant is a little bit unexpected result. It is also interesting that we, for one special choice of background fields, after rescalling space-time metric, made a possible connection to the Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC). It turns out that cosmological constant is conserved in the period of the succession of aeons, which could mean that one aeon inherits the inflationary expansion from the previous one.

1 Introduction
Einstein general theory of relativity is the geometric theory of gravitation. It describes gravity as a geometric property of space-time. In particular, the curvature of space-time is directly related to the four-momentum of matter and radiation. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations [1].

In 1915, when Einstein finished his general theory of relativity, the universe was con-

sidered as a static one [2]. From Einstein equations of gravitational field it follows that

universe is a dynamic system. Facing with this inconsistency of his theory and ruling

philosophical beliefs that universe is static, Einstein changed his theory adding to the

constant

[3]. Modified gravitational equations gives a static universe as one of the solutions. But a

few years later, expansion of the Universe was discovered by Hubble and confirmed that

Universe was dynamic. It seemed that cosmological constant was no longer necessary.

But in 1998 two independent observations of the distant type Ia supernova [4] proved that

expansion of universe is accelerated. Acceleration of universe expansion is possible only if

cosmological constant  is positive, which means that vacuum density vac is positive and pressure is negative. So, the cosmological constant came back in the story. The problem

which is still unresolved is related to the big discrepancy in order of its magnitude between

experimental observations and theoretical expectations based on the quantum field theory.

The fact that cosmological constant is positive was the basis of the formulation of the

new cosmological model named Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) [5], idea proposed by

Roger Penrose. The current picture based on Big-Bang and Einstein General Relativity

Theory tells us that universe in the presence of the positive cosmological constant has

been expanding ever since - it starts with Big Bang and it should continue to eternity.

The CCC assumes that this is just one stage (aeon) in the history of universe. There

is a succession of aeons, and conformally rescalled end of one aeon is a big-bang of the

next aeon. Why can we conformally rescale space-time? The main point is that matter in

that period of succession of aeons is in the form of radiation, which means that we deal

with particles of zero mass. For such particles equations of motion are invariant under

conformal rescalling - such particles do not have "sense" for distance.

Let us leave for a while this story on cosmology and evolution of universe. In this

paper we start from bosonic string action in the presence of the gravitational Gµ , NeveuSchwarz Bµ and dilaton field  [7] and comment quantization of the bosonic string

from the viewpoint of the one-loop -functions [8]. They represent the conditions for

background fields under which quantum conformal symmetry is conserved. Demanding

quantum conformal invariance, we have µG = µB = 0 and  = c, where c is central charge of the Virasoro algebra. The equation  = c is a consequence of the particular
relation between beta functions µG and 

DµµG + (4)2D  = 0 ,

(1.1)

where Dµ denotes covariant derivative with respect to the space-time metric Gµ . The quantum conformal invariance can be reached in two ways. The standard one is
putting c = 0 and D = 26 and that is a case of critical string [8]. In this case the particular

2

combination of µG and  represents the equation for Gµ in the form of Einstein one with some matter. This equation as well as µB = 0 and  = 0 can be considered as equations of motion for the background fields Gµ , Bµ and , respectively. These equations can be obtained by varying the particular effective string landscape action with respect to the corresponding background fields [8].
Further we we will discuss other possibility, c = 0 and D 26. The anomaly, represented by the Schwinger term of the Virasoro algebra, can be cancelled by adding Liouville term to the sigma model action. Appropriately chosen coefficient in front of Liouville term makes the theory fully conformally invariant [9]. The particular combination of µG and  - c gives the equation for Gµ in the form of Einstein one in the presence of some matter and cosmological constant. The central charge of Virasoro algebra takes the role of cosmology constant. This equation with µB = 0 and  = c can be considered as equations of motion for background fields Gµ , Bµ and , respectively, because they can be obtained by varying the string action from [8] with additional, cosmological term. It is obvious that both options, c = 0 and c = 0, belong to the string theory landscape [10].
In general, central charge is an operator which commutes with all other symmetry generators. Here we speak about conformal symmetry on the world-sheet, while CCC is dealing with rescalling symmetry as a part of conformal symmetry in target space. But, rescalling target space and shrinking it to the point, we rescale at the same time the world-sheet. String landscape theory obtained for c = 0 provides the possibility, for the specific choice of background fields, to express cosmological constant in terms of the Virasoro algebra central charge. Consequently, possible conclusion which follows from this consideration is that central charge stays unchanged and it is conserved quantity during transition between aeons when the conformal symmetry is the ruling one.
At the end we give some closing remarks and comments.
2 Action and standard conditions for quantum conformal invariance
Here we present the known result that standard conditions of quantum conformal invariance of the bosonic string theory can be considered as Euler-Lagrange equations of motions obtained from particular string landscape action [8].
The string action in the presence of gravitational Gµ and Bµ is conformally invariant classically, but on the quantum level symmetry is broken. In order to keep quantum conformal invariance the dilaton term is added. The action describing the string dynamics in the presence of the gravitational Gµ , Neveu-Schwarz Bµ and dilaton field  is of the

tensor is denoted with Rµ , Bµ = µB + Bµ + Bµ is the field strength for the

field Bµ and aµ = µ is the gradient of the dilaton field.

Vanishing of these beta functions is the standard condition for quantum conformal

invariance. From these three conditions equations of motion for background fields Gµ ,

in this action is Einstein-like. Because of that the metric Gµ is called sigma model metric and G~µ is Einstein metric.

3 Adding of Liouville term

There is another possibility to establish conformal invariance on the quantum level. Vanishing of µG and µB implies constant value of the third - function,  = c because of the relation (1.1). On these conditions, for D 26, the non-linear sigma model (2.1) becomes conformal field theory. There exists a Virasoro algebra with central charge c.
Present anomaly can be cancelled by adding the corresponding Wess-Zumino term, which in this concrete case takes the form of Liouville action

From the conditions for quantum conformal invariance, µG = 0, µB = 0 and  - c = 0, in analogy with previous case, we can construct linear combination which can be interpreted as equations of motion for the fields Gµ , Bµ and , respectively,

The last term in the action can not be considered as cosmological one, because it is not a

Here we can identify the Einstein-Hilbert action with some matter originating from metric Gµ and Kalb-Ramond field and cosmological constant  = 2c¯. The central charge of the Virasoro algebra in this model takes the role of cosmological constant.

4 Concluding remarks
In this paper we considered the bosonic string in the presence of metric Gµ , Kalb-Ramond field Bµ and dilaton field  in the context of the conformal anomaly cancellation. Using obtained results we showed that it is possible to obtain cosmological constant within string theory landscape and related cosmological constant with Virasoro central charge. The collateral benefit is a possible connection with CCC.
Conformal anomaly is expressed via  functions G, B and . Putting all three  functions to be equal to zero we obtained conditions which background fields must obey in order to keep conformal symmetry on the quantum level. So, these equations could be considered as equations of motion for the background fields and it is possible to write down the action which is known in the literature as action of the effective theory or, shorter, effective action.
But, there is a relation between G and  which enables us to choose  to be a constant. That is in fact a central charge of the Virasoro algebra. In order to keep quantum conformal invariance we added Liouville term to the action to cancel Schwinger one. But if we repeat the procedure from the standard case, introducing Einstein frame, we got an
6

effective action which, in the special case of constant dilaton  = ¯ 0, turns into EinsteinHilbert action with some matter and cosmological constant  = 2c¯. The cosmological constant is linear function of the Virasoro algebra central charge  = A · c + B (A, B are constants). It is interesting and a little bit unexpected that cosmological constant is obtained within string theory landscape. This can be treated as main outcome of this paper.
In the CCC, which is still developing theory, at the end of one period (aeon) there is matter in the form of ultrarelativistic bosonic particles or in the form of radiation (fermions are crumbled into radiation [5]) i.e. existing particles are massless ones or can be considered as massless ones. As it is known, equations of motion of massless particles are conformally invariant.
Let us note that in the CCC theory it is spoken about conformal symmetry in D dimensional space-time (target space), not about two dimensional world-sheet conformal symmetry, which conformal central charge c is related to the cosmological constant. Rescalling symmetry as a part of conformal symmetry in target space implies the rescalling symmetry on world-sheet. That fact can be easily seen through induced world-sheet metric
G = Gµ xµx .
Because the scale dimension of target metric is zero [11] and the coordinates are scaled as xµ = exµ, the scale factor of induced world-sheet metric is e2. Weyl rescalling symmetry can be considered as a part of the extended conformal group [12]. So, conformal transformation in target space produces conformal transformation on world-sheet.
Choosing dilaton field to be constant, we actually choose the appropriate coefficient  (2.9) and obtain Einstein-Hilbert-like action with cosmological constant (3.10). Obtained action (3.10) is a possible candidate for the action which is actual, at least, in that short period between end one aeon and beginning of the next one. Conserved cosmological constant implies that inflationary expansion of current aeon is inherited from the previous one. Similar considerations and conclusions are given in [13]. Let us stress that this side result of the paper does not mean that our intention was to analyze and examine the CCC, but we took CCC as it is and tried to find some arguments for some of its features. The main result is that we succeded to obtain an essential component of the cosmological evolution within theory from string landscape.
