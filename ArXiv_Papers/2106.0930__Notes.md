## Abstract

Proton elastic scattering off Sn isotopes at $E_p=295$ MeV in the mass number range of $A=$116--124 was investigated using calculation employing relativistic impulse approximation (RIA) with theoretical densities obtained for the Sn isotopes from relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) and nonrelativistic Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (SHFB) calculations of spherical nuclei. In the RIA calculations, a modified version of the Murdock and Horowitz model that includes a density dependence in the effective nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) interaction was used. A calculation using the theoretical density obtained from a relativistic calculation employing the DD-ME2 interaction successfully reproduced the experimental data for $^{122}$Sn$(p,p)$, but it overestimated the $^{116}$Sn$(p,p)$ and $^{118}$Sn$(p,p)$ cross sections at backward angles. Isotopic analyses of the $(p,p)$ reactions combined with nuclear structure properties were performed based on reaction calculations that used a model density modified from the DD-ME2 density to optimize the neutron density of the Sn isotopes by fitting the isotopic cross section ratios. The resulting optimized density reproduced the experimental $(p,p)$ data for the series of Sn isotopes from $^{116}$Sn to $^{124}$Sn. The neutron root-mean-square(rms) radii and the skin thickness of the Sn isotopes obtained in the present analysis exhibited smooth $A$ dependences in the range of $A=$116--124, which are consistent with the theoretical predictions obtained using the DD-ME2 interaction but seem to contradict the experimental results determined from the $(p,p)$ data. In a detailed analysis of the surface neutron density probed by proton elastic scattering, a signal of the shell effect at $N=66$ in Sn isotopes was found.
