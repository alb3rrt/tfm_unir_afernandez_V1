## Abstract

In this paper, we present a 4-approximation algorithm for MISR which is based on a similar recursive partitioning scheme. However, we use a more general class of polygons -- polygons that are horizontally or vertically convex -- which allows us to provide an arguably simpler analysis and already improve the approximation ratio. Using a new fractional charging argument and fork-fences to guide the partitions, we improve the approximation ratio even more to 4. We hope that our ideas will lead to further progress towards a PTAS for MISR.
