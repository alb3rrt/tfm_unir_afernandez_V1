## Abstract

Laser Doppler holography was introduced as a full-field imaging technique to measure blood flow in the retina and choroid with an as yet unrivaled temporal resolution. We here investigate separating the different contributions to the power Doppler signal in order to isolate the flow waveforms of vessels in the posterior pole of the human eye. Distinct flow behaviors are found in retinal arteries and veins with seemingly interrelated waveforms. We demonstrate a full field mapping of the local resistivity index, and the possibility to perform unambiguous identification of retinal arteries and veins on the basis of their systolodiastolic variations. Finally we investigate the arterial flow waveforms in the retina and choroid and find synchronous and similar waveforms, although with a lower pulsatility in choroidal vessels. This work demonstrates the potential held by laser Doppler holography to study ocular hemodynamics in healthy and diseased eyes.
