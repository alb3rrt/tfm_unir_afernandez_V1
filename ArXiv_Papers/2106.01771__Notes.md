## Abstract

We report some recent results on analytic pseudodifferential operators, also known as Wick operators. An important tool in our study is the Bargmann transform which provides a coupling between the classical (real) and analytic pseudodifferential calculus. Since the Bargmann transform of Hermite functions gives rise to formal power series in the complex domain, the results are formulated in terms of the Bargmann images of PilipoviÄ‡ spaces.
