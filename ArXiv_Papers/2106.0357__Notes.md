## Abstract

In this work we present a preliminary study on using GCNs for solving the vertex p-center problem (PCP), which is another classic COP on graphs. In particular, we investigate whether a successful model based on end-to-end training for the TSP can be adapted to a PCP, which is defined on a similar 2D Euclidean graph input as the usually used version of the TSP. However, the objective of the PCP has a min-max structure which could lead to many symmetric optimal, i.e., ground-truth solutions and other potential difficulties for learning. Our obtained preliminary results show that indeed a direct transfer of network architecture ideas does not seem to work too well. Thus we think that the PCP could be an interesting benchmark problem for new ideas and developments in the area of GCNs.
