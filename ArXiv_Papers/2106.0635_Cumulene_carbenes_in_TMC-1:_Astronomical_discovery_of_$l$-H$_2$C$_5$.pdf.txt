ABSTRACT
We report the first detection in space of the cumulene carbon chain l-H2C5. A total of eleven rotational transitions, with Jup = 7-10 and Ka = 0 and 1, were detected in TMC-1 in the 31.0-50.4 GHz range using the Yebes 40m radio telescope. We derive a column density of (1.8±0.5)×1010 cm-2. In addition, we report observations of other cumulene carbenes detected previously in TMC-1, to compare their abundances with the newly detected cumulene carbene chain. We find that l-H2C5 is 4.0 times less abundant than the larger cumulene carbene l-H2C6, while it is 300 and 500 times less abundant than the shorter chains l-H2C3 and l-H2C4. We discuss the most likely gas-phase chemical routes to these cumulenes in TMC-1 and stress that chemical kinetics studies able to distinguish between different isomers are needed to shed light on the chemistry of CnH2 isomers with n > 3.

1. Introduction
Cumulene carbenes are highly polar carbon-chains with elemental formula H2Cn. They contain consecutive carbon-carbon double bonds and two nonbonded electrons localized on the terminal C atom. These species play major roles as reaction intermediates in combustion and plasma processes and they are also of astrophysical interest since some of them have been detected in interstellar and circumstellar environments. The first astronomical discovery of the simplest cumulene carbene propadienylidene, l-H2C3, was carried out by Cernicharo et al. (1991a) toward the cold dark cloud TMC-1. Butatrienylidene, l-H2C4, was detected in the carbon-rich circumstellar envelope of IRC+10216 by Cernicharo et al. (1991b) and in TMC-1 by Kawaguchi et al. (1991) and later, the larger cumulene carbene hexapentaenylidene, lH2C6, was detected in TMC-1, IRC+10216 and L1527 (Langer et al. 1997; Guélin et al. 2000; Araki et al. 2017).
Cumulene carbenes are metastable isomers, lying 0.5-0.6 eV above the most stable isomer, which is a polyacetylene (HCnH) for an even n or a cyclic structure when the number of carbon atoms is odd. Thus, their astronomical detection demonstrates how far from thermochemical equilibrium is the composition of interstellar clouds. The case of HNC, which is less stable than HCN by about 0.6 eV but as abundant as HCN (Herbst 1978), illustrates this point as well.
Pentatetraenylidene, l-H2C5, is the cumulene carbene from the isomeric family with formula C5H2. l-H2C5 is a high energy isomer and lies 0.564 eV above the most stable isomers, the nonpolar pentadiynylidene (HCCCCH) and ethynyl cyclopropenylidene (c-C3HCCH), whose energy separation is very small 0.043 eV. Other two species are part of this isomeric fam-
Based on observations carried out with the Yebes 40m telescope (projects 19A003, 20A014, and 20D15). The 40m radiotelescope at Yebes Observatory is operated by the Spanish Geographic Institute (IGN, Ministerio de Transportes, Movilidad y Agenda Urbana).

ily, HCCCHCC and c-C3H2C2, placed at 0.737 and 0.910 eV above the most stable forms, respectively (Seburg et al. 1997). All these isomers, except the nonpolar HCCCCH, have been studied in the laboratory (Travers et al. 1997; McCarthy et al. 1997; Gottlieb et al. 1998) and, thus, their transition frequencies are well known. However, until very recently none of them has been observed in space. Cernicharo et al. (2021a) have reported the first identification in TMC-1 of the most stable isomer of this family, c-C3HCCH, using a high sensitivity line survey gathered with the Yebes 40m radio telescope. This achievement opens the door to the identification of high energy isomers of this family in TMC-1.
In this Letter we report the first identification of the l-H2C5 cumulene carbene in space towards TMC-1 and a comparative study of the previously detected cumulene carbenes in this source. The derived column densities for these singular energetic species are interpreted by chemical models and used to understand the chemical processes leading to their formation.
2. Observations
The data presented in this work are part of a deep spectral line survey in the Q band towards TMC-1 (J2000 = 4h41m41.9s and J2000 = +2541 27.0 ) that was performed at the Yebes 40m radio telescope between November 2019 and April 2021. The survey was done using new receivers, built within the Nanocosmos project1 consisting of two HEMT cold amplifiers covering the 31.0-50.4 GHz band with horizontal and vertical polarizations. Fast Fourier transform spectrometers (FFTSs) with 8 × 2.5 GHz bands per lineal polarization allow a simultaneous scan of a bandwidth of 18 GHz at a spectral resolution of 38.15 kHz. This setup has been described before by Tercero et al. (2021).
The observations were performed using the frequency switching technique with a frequency throw of 10 MHz or

served, 31.08-49.52 GHz and 31.98-50.42 GHz, which permitted

us to check that no spurious ghosts are produced in the down-

conversion chain. The signal coming from the receiver is down-

converted to 1-19.5 GHz, and then split into 8 bands with a cov-

erage of 2.5 GHz each of which are analyzed by the FFTs.

Pointing and focus corrections were obtained by observing

strong SiO masers towards nearby evolved stars (IKTau and

UOri). Pointing errors were always within 2 - 3 . Total cali-

bration uncertainties have been adopted to be 10 % based on the

observed repeatability of the line intensities between dif- ferent

observing runs. All data have been analyzed using the GILDAS package2.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Detection of l-H2C5 in TMC-1
l-H2C5 was observed in the laboratory by McCarthy et al. (1997) and the prediction of its rotational spectrum is available in the CDMS (Müller et al. 2005). This prediction, based in the laboratory data from McCarthy et al. (1997), is implemented in the MADEX code (Cernicharo 2012) that was used to identify the spectral features in our TMC-1 Q-band survey. McCarthy et al. (1997) observed in the laboratory a total of nine rotational transitions for l-H2C5 up to Jup=5 at 23 GHz. The derived parameters from McCarthy et al. (1997) (see Table 1) allow to accurately predict the rotational transitions for l-H2C5 in the Q-band. The molecule has a dipole moment of 5.9 D (Maluendes & McLean 1992) which makes it a very promising candidate to be observed in our TMC-1 data. In this manner, we search for this species in our TMC-1 survey and we found a total of eleven transitions ranging from Jup = 7-10, whose frequencies agree very well with those predicted, discrepancies are smaller than 25 kHz. 90,9 -80,8 line is blended with a negative feature produced in the folding of the frequency switching data while 100,10 - 90,9 transition is not detected due to the limited sensitivity at the predicted frequency. In any case the non-detection is consistent with the expected intensity. All the l-H2C5 lines observed in TMC-1, shown in Fig. 1 and listed in Table 2, were analyzed, together with those observed in laboratory, using an asymmetric rotor Hamiltonian with the FITWAT code (Cernicharo et al. 2018) to derive the rotational and centrifugal distortion constants. The results from this fit are shown in Table 1 together with those obtained by McCarthy et al. (1997) only with laboratory data. With this new global fit an improvement of the uncertainty in the rotational and distortion constants is obtained. Hence, this fit is recommended to predict the frequency of the rotational transitions of l-H2C5 with uncertainties between 10 and 200 kHz in the 50-116 GHz frequency range.
As l-H2C5 has C2v symmetry, it is necessary to discern between ortho-l-H2C5 and para-l-H2C5. The ortho levels are described by Ka odd while the para levels by Ka even. The nuclear spin-weights are 3 and 1 for ortho-l-H2C5 and para-l-H2C5, respectively. The JKa,Kc = 11,1 is the lowest ortho energy state located 13.4 K above the para ground level, JKa,Kc = 00,0. Hence, from the eleven observed lines eight of them correspond to ortho-l-H2C5 and the remain-

ing three to para-l-H2C5. An analysis of the line intensities through a line model fitting procedure Cernicharo et al. (2021a) provides a rotational temperature of  10 K and column densities N(ortho-l-H2C5)=(1.3±0.3)×1010cm-1 and N(para-lH2C5)=(5.0±2.0)×109cm-1. The ortho/para ratio is calculated to be 2.6±1.5. We have assumed a linewidth of 0.6 km s-1 and
a source of uniform brightness temperature with a diameter of
80 (Fossé et al. 2001). Figure 1 shows, in red, the computed
synthetic spectrum.

3.2. Column densities for l-H2C3, l-H2C4 and l-H2C6 in TMC-1
The carbene l-H2C3 is the smallest cumulene species studied in this work. The laboratory spectroscopic data used to predict the l-H2C3 spectrum were reported by Vrtilek et al. (1990). The electric dipole moment calculated for this molecule is 4.1 D (Defrees & McLean 1986). As for l-H2C5, l-H2C3 has C2v symmetry and, thus, it is necessary to discern between ortho and para l-H2C3. In the same manner than for l-H2C5 the ortho levels are described by Ka odd while the para levels by Ka even, with 3/1 ratio for ortho/para. Only three rotational transitions for l-H2C3 lie within the 31.0-50.4 GHz frequency range. One transition, 20,2-10,1, corresponds to para-l-H2C3 and the other two, 21,2-11,1 and 21,1-11,0 are ortho-l-H2C3 transitions. The lines are shown in Fig.2 while the line parameters are collected in Table 2. The position of the lines is consistent with the calculated frequencies and the systemic velocity of the source, VLSR = 5.83 km s-1 (Cernicharo et al. 2020). We assumed Tr = 10 K and the column densities N(ortho-l-H2C3)=(1.5±0.5)×1012cm-1 and N(para-l-H2C3)=(4.0±1.2)×1011cm-1. The ortho/para ratio is calculated to be 3.8±1.1. Collisional rates are available for the system l-H2C3/He (Khalifa et al. 2019). Adopting a volume density for TMC-1 of 4×104 cm-3 (Cernicharo & Guélin 1987; Fossé et al. 2001) we derive an excitation temperature for the two ortho transitions of 9 K, and of 8.5 K for the para transition. Hence, the adopted rotational temperature seems well adapted to the excitation conditions of this molecule.
The next member of the l-H2Cn family is l-H2C4. The rotational spectrum for this cumulene was observed by Killian et al. (1990) and Travers et al. (1996). From ab initio calculations the dipole moment of l-H2C4 has been estimated to be 4.1 D (Oswald & Botschwina 1995), similar to the smaller cumulene carbene l-H2C3. The lines for ortho- and para-l-H2C4 are clearly detected in our TMC-1 survey as can be seen in Fig. 3. However, it should be noted that there are small discrepancies (of about 30 kHz for the para species) between the observed and predicted

frequencies from CDMS. We observed a total of six rotational transitions with Jup = 4 and 5 and Ka = 0 and 1. Four of them pertain to ortho-l-H2C4 and two to para-l-H2C4. All the line parameters are given in Table 2. From the observed integrated line intensities we obtained a Tr = 10 K and column densities for the ortho and para species of N(ortho-l-H2C4)=(2.5±0.8)×1012cm-1 and N(para-l-H2C4)=(8.0±2.3)×1011cm-1. The ortho/para ratio for l-H2C4 is 3.1±0.9.
l-H2C6 is, to date, the larger cumulene carbene observed in space. Its dipole moment is calculated (Maluendes & McLean 1992) to be larger than those for the smaller cumulenes, with a value of 6.2 D. The rotational spectrum has been investigated by McCarthy et al. (1997) and the derived spectroscopic parameters are used to predict its transition frequencies. Due to its larger molecular size, many rotational transition for l-H2C6 can be observed in the 31.0-50.4 GHz frequency range. As for all the other cumulene carbenes, and due to its symmetry, it is necessary to discern between ortho- and para-l-H2C6. Hence, we observed a total of twenty-one transitions for l-H2C6, four-

teen for ortho- and seven for para-l-H2C6 (see Fig. 4). Line parameters are collected in Table 2. We derived from the observed integrated line intensities a Tr = 10 K and the column densities N(ortho-l-H2C6)=(6.0±1.8)×1010cm-1 and N(para-lH2C3)=(2.0±0.6)×1010cm-1. The ortho/para ratio is calculated to be 3.0±0.9.
From our observations we obtain the following relative abundances for l-H2C3/l-H2C4/l-H2C5/l-H2C6 in TMC-1, 344/561/1/4.4. l-H2C4 is the most abundant cumulene carbene in TMC-1, followed by l-H2C3. The larger species l-H2C5 and lH2C6 are much less abundant compared to the shorter cumulene chain, with l-H2C6 being 4.4 times more abundant than the odd member l-H2C5. It is worth noting that, within the uncertainties, the four cumelenes studied in this work have an ortho/para abundance ratio of 3. Hence, no significant ortho to para conversion can be noticed for these molecules.
3.3. Chemistry of cumulene carbenes
In order to understand how cumulene carbenes l-H2Cn can be formed in TMC-1, we carried out gas-phase chemical modeling calculations. We adopted typical conditions of cold dark clouds, i.e., a volume density of H nuclei of 2 ×104 cm-3, a gas kinetic temperature of 10 K, a visual extinction of 30 mag, a cosmicray ionization rate of H2 of 1.3 × 10-17 s-1, and the so-called set of low-metal elemental abundances (e.g., Agúndez & Wakelam 2013). We used the chemical network RATE12 from the UMIST database (McElroy et al. 2013), updated with results from Lin et al. (2013), and expanded with the subset of gas-phase chemical reactions revised by Loison et al. (2017) in their study of the chemistry of C3H and C3H2 isomers.

Cabezas et al.: Discovery of H2C5 in TMC-1

Among the family of carbenes l-H2Cn, the one for which the chemistry is better constrained is by far the smallest member l-

H2C3, which has been discussed in detail by Loison et al. (2017).

This species is mainly formed upon dissociative recombination

with electrons of the linear and cyclic in turn are formed through the radiative

iassosmoceirastioofnCo3fHC+33,Hw+haincdh

H2. If we focus in the so-called early time, a few 105 yr, where

gas-phase chemical models of cold dark clouds reproduce bet-

ter TMC-1 observations (e.g., Agúndez & Wakelam 2013), the

calculated abundance is about one order of magnitude below the

observed value (see Fig. 5), but the calculated cyclic-to-linear

abundance ratio agrees very well with the observed value of 31

(Cernicharo et al. 2021a; this work). For members of the series

l-H2Cn with n > 3, information on the chemistry of the different

possible isomers is poorly known and thus chemical networks,

such as UMIST RATE12, do not distinguish between them. The

calculated abundances of C4H2 and C6H2 agree within a factor of

2-3 with the observed abundances of l-H2C4 and l-H2C6, respec-

tively (see Fig. 5), although one must keep in mind that obser-

vations only refer to the cumulene while the model includes also

other isomers, in particular the more stable non-polar species

HCnH. If the isomer HCnH is significantly more abundant than H2Cn for n = 4,6 in TMC-1, then the abundances calculated by

the chemical model for C4H2 and C6H2 would be too low. In

the case of C5H2, the calculated peak abundance is about 30

times lower than the observed abundance of l-H2C5 (see Fig. 5),

although this may not be a problem if the more stable isomer

HC5H is substantially more abundant than the carbene l-H2C5.

For l-H2Cn with n > 3, the chemical route analogous to that forming l-H2C3 has variable degrees of efficiency. For exampdFlioear,tinvfoe=ram5s,astothicoeinartoiooufnteCbd4eHotwe+3seiensnortCewl4aHotir+2vkeablnyedceaHffiusc(eiMeCnc5tEHtwh+aandnkoesetstaonl.ot1th9ree9ar9ac)-t.

with H2 (McElvany et al. 1987; Bohme & Wlodek 1990), while fCo6rHm+2atwiointhofHC2 6(HA+3niicsiucnhc2e0rt0a3in).dFuuerttohetrhestuundkiensowofnrreeaaccttiiovnitsyino-f volving hydrocarbon ions, in particular regarding isomer differ-

entiation, are highly desirable. According to the chemical model,

reactions of CnH- anions with H atoms are a major route to CnH2

molecules, such as C4H2, C5H2, and C6H2. These reactions have been studied in the laboratory for anions CnH- with n = 2, 4,

6, and 7 and have been found to be rapid and to yield CnH2 as main product (Barckholtz et al. 2001). The reaction with n = 5,

although not studied, is likely to behave similarly. It is however

unknown whether the carbene isomer H2Cn or the more stable HCnH is preferentially formed. It would be very helpful to in-

vestigate this particular point.

Other formation routes, apart from CnH+m + e- and CnH- + H, can be provided by neutral-neutral reactions. For example,

the chemical model points to the reaction between atomic C and

the propargyl radical (CH2CCH), recently detected in TMC-1

(Agúndez et al. 2021), as a source of C4H2 isomers. This reaction is assumed to be fast by Loison et al. (2017), but calculations

of the rate coefficient and product distribution at low tempera-

tures are needed. Similarly, the reaction C + C4H3 is assumed

to proceed fast by Smith et al. (2004) and provides an important

route to C5H2 isomers, but more detailed studies on this reaction

are necessary. Finally, we note that the cyclic C5H2 isomer c-

C3HCCH recently detected by Cernicharo et al. (2021a) is most likely formed through the reaction between CCH and c-C3H2.
