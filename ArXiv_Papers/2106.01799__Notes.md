## Abstract

In this work, we study the convergence of the normalized Yamabe flow with positive Yamabe constant on a class of pseudo-manifolds that includes stratified spaces with iterated cone-edge metrics. We establish convergence under a low energy condition. We also prove a concentration - compactness dichotomy, and investigate what the alternatives to convergence are. We end by investigating a non-convergent example due to Viaclovsky in more detail.
