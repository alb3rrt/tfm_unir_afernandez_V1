The Goldbach conjecture with summands in arithmetic progressions
Juho Salmensuu
Abstract We prove that, for almost all r  N 1/2/ logO(1) N , for any given b1 (mod r) with (b1, r) = 1, and for almost all b2 (mod r) with (b2, r) = 1, we have that almost all natural numbers 2n  N with 2n  b1 + b2 (mod r) can be written as the sum of two prime numbers 2n = p1 + p2, where p1  b1 (mod r) and p2  b2 (mod r). This improves the previous result which required r  N 1/3/ logO(1) N instead of r  N 1/2/ logO(1) N . We also improve some other results concerning variations of the problem.
1 Introduction
1.1 Statements of results
In this paper, we study the binary Goldbach conjecture in the case where the summands are restricted to arithmetic progressions with large moduli. Let N > 0 and define
Eb1,b2,r(N ) := #{2n  N | 2n  b1 + b2 (mod r), 2n = p1 + p2 for all primes pi  bi (mod r)}. Our main result is the following.
Theorem 1.1. Let A, B > 0, N  3 and R  N 1/2/ logA N . Then, for all but O(R/ logB N ) integers 3  r  R, for any fixed b1 (mod r) with (b1, r) = 1 and for all but O(r/ logB r) integers b2 (mod r) with (b2, r) = 1, we have
Eb1,b2,r(N ) = o(N/r), provided that A is large enough depending on B.
This improves Bauer's result [Bau17a], which had 1/3 instead of 1/2 and had restriction that r has to be a prime. When also b2 is fixed, Bauer [Bau17b] has showed that Eb1,b2,r(N ) = o(N/r) holds for almost all primes r  N 7/30-/ logO(1) N .
We will also prove the following theorem, where the exceptional set is very small. Theorem 1.2. Let  > 0 and N  3. There exists D > 0 such that, for all but O(logD N ) primes r  N 5/24-, for any fixed b1, b2 (mod r) with (b1, r) = (b2, r) = 1, we have
Eb1,b2,r(N ) = o(N/r). This improves Bauer's result [Bau12], which had 5/48 instead of 5/24. [Bau17a, Theorem 2] has 5/24, but the minor arc calculations appear to be incorrect. Using the minor arcs calculations from [BW13] one can recover [Bau17a, Theorem 2] in the following form:
Theorem A. Let B,  > 0 and N  3. There exists D > 0 such that, for all but O(logD N ) primes 3  r  N 5/24-, for any fixed b1 (mod r) with (b1, r) = 1 and for all but O(r/ logB r) integers b2 (mod r) with (b2, r) = 1, we have
Eb1,b2,r(N ) = o(N/r). We improve this result in the following theorem.

Theorem 1.3. Let B,  > 0 and N  3. There exists D > 0 such that, for all but O(logD N ) primes 3  r  N 5/12-, for any fixed b1 (mod r) with (b1, r) = 1 and for all but O(r/ logB r) integers b2 (mod r) with (b2, r) = 1, we have
Eb1,b2,r(N ) = o(N/r).
Assuming GRH, we can completely dispose of the exceptional sets for the moduli from Theorems 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 and replace the exponent 5/24 in Theorem 1.2 with 1/4.

Remark. Using the methods of this paper it is possible to prove similar results for the ternary Goldbach problem. For example, we can prove the following: Let A, B > 0, N > 3 and R  N 1/2/ logA N . Then, for all but O(R/ logB N ) integers 3 < r  R, for any fixed b1, b2 (mod r) with (b1b2, r) = 1, for all but O(r/ logB r) integers b3 (mod r) with (b3, r) = 1 and for all n  N with n  b1 + b2 + b3 (mod r), we can write

n = p1 + p2 + p3,

where p1, p2, p3 are primes with pi  bi (mod r).

be the singular series for Goldbach's problem in arithmetic progressions. Our aim is to prove the following three theorems.

Theorem 1.4. Let A > 0. Let R > 0 and N  3 be such that R  (RN )1/2/ log2A N . Then

Theorems 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 follow respectively from Theorems 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6. (Note that the contribution of the prime powers in the sums is negligible.)
We use the circle method to prove these theorems. The major improvement to the previous results comes from the way we arrange the circle method. Let

Sb,r(H, ) :=

(rn + b)e(n), Sb,r(H, ) :=

(n)e(n)

nH

nH nb (mod r)

and M = rN + b1 + b2. In the previous papers, the circle method has been applied in the following

way:

1

(n1)(n2) = Sb1,r(M, )Sb2,r(M, )e(-M )d.

M =n1+n2

0

nibi (mod ri)

We apply the circle method inside the arithmetic progression (M  b1 + b2 (mod r)):

1

(rn1 + b1)(rn2 + b2) = Sb1,r(N, )Sb2,r(N, )e(-N )d.

N =n1+n2

0

Using the circle method inside the arithmetic progression leads to easier exponential sums. We
demonstrate this by comparing Type I estimates in both cases. Let   [0, 1] and a, q  N be such that 1  a  q, (a, q) = 1 and | - a/q|  q-2. Let
N, M  1. Let an be a complex sequence such that |an|  1. Write X := N M .

Using the standard methods to evaluate type I sum corresponding to S, we see that

nN,mM

ame(nm)



r

X logA

, X

nmb (mod r)

(1.2)

provided that r logA X  q  X/(r logA X) and M  X/(r2 logA X) for some A > 0 depending on A. Similarly, for type I sum corresponding to S, we see that

nN,mM

am er (nm)



r

X logA

, X

nmb (mod r)

(1.3)

provided that logA X  q  X/(r logA X) and M  X/(r logA X) for some A > 0 depending

on A. We can see that (1.3) holds for a much wider range than (1.2).

For A, N  1 define

MA,N :=

MA,N (q, a),

qlogA N 1aq
(a,q)=1

where

MA,N (q, a) := {  [0, 1] | | - a/q|  N -1 logA N }.

Also define mA := mA,N := [0, 1] \ MA,N . We call MA,N major arcs and mA,N minor arcs. We split

Sb1,r(N, )Sb2,r(N, )e(-N )d =

Sb1,r(N, )Sb2,r(N, )e(-N )d

MA,N

+

Sb1,r(N, )Sb2,r(N, )e(-N )d.

mA,N

In Section 3 we give an asymptotic formula for the major arcs contribution. We analyse the minor arc contribution in Section 4. Since the error term, coming from the minor arc and major arc analysis, in some cases depends on Ed(x) defined in (1.1), we will give some estimates for Ed(x) in Section 5. We prove Theorems 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 in Section 6.

2 Auxiliary lemmas

In this section, we present some auxiliary lemmas, which we use later.

Lemma 2.1. Let   R and N1, N2  N with N1 < N2. Then

e(n)  min(N2 - N1, ||||-1).
N1 <nN2

Proof. See e.g. [Nat96, Lemma 4.7].

Lemma 2.2. For any X, Y  1, we have

min(Y, ||m||-1)

and the claim follows from a standard estimate (see e.g. [Nat96, Lemma 4.10]).

We use the standard circle method machinery to do so.

3.1 Generating function
In this subsection, we prove an approximation lemma for the generating function

Sb,r(N, ) = (rn + b)e(n).
nN
First, we prove the following rational exponential sum estimate.
Lemma 3.1. Let a, b, q, r  N be such that (a, q) = (b, r) = 1. Then
rq
erq(ah) = 1(q,r)=1µ(q)erq(abq(r)).
h=1 hb (mod r)
(h,q)=1
Proof. Since (b, r) = 1, we have for d|q that the congruence system

x  b (mod r) x  0 (mod d)

is soluble only if (d, r) = 1 in which case x  bd(r) is the unique solution (mod dr). Hence

rq

=

µ(d)erq (abd(r) )

eq/d(aj).

d|q (d,r)=1

jq/d

The last sum is non-zero only for d = q and the claim follows.

We are now ready to prove the following approximation lemma for the generating function.

Lemma 3.2. Let a, q  N with 1  a  q and (a, q) = 1. Let   [0, 1],  :=  - a/q and N, b, r  N be such that (b, r) = 1. Then

Sb,r(N, )

=

1(q,r)=1µ(q)erq (ab(q(r) (rq)

-

1))r

e(n) + O q(1 + ||N )Erq(rN + b) .

nN

Proof. Recalling the definition (1.1) and rearranging we see that

Sb,r(t, a/q) =

(n)erq(a(n - b))

nrt+b nb (mod r)

= erq(-ab)

(n)erq (an)

nrt+b nb (mod r)

rq

erq (ah)

h=1 hb (mod r)
(h,q)=1

rq

erq(ah) + O(qErq(rt + b))

(h,q)=1

Using Lemma 3.1 we now have

Sb,r(t, a/q)

=

1(q,r)=1µ(q)erq (ab(q(r)

-

1))

rt (rq)

+

O(qErq (rt

Thus

U (t)

Sb,r (t,

a/q)

-

1(q,r)=1µ(q)erq (ab(q(r) (rq)

-

1))r

1  qErq(rt + b).

By partial summation it follows that

Sb,r (N ,

1(q,r)=1 µ(q )erq (ab(q (r) (rq)

If q  logA N and   MA,N (q, a), then the error term in the previous lemma is O(Erq(rN + b) log2A N ).

3.2 Main term

We are now ready to prove the following proposition.

Proposition 3.3. Let A, N > 0. Let r, b1, b2, H  N be such that b1, b2  r, (r, b1) = (r, b2) = 1 and H  N . Then

In order to analyse the previous sum, we will use Vaughan's identity for (n) and split the sum into type I and type II sums, which we will analyse in standard manners.

4.2 Minor arcs without b2-average

In this subsection, we give an upper bound for (4.2). First, we introduce some auxiliary lemmas.

Lemma 4.5. (Alternative Type II estimate) Let M, N, X, A  1 with M N  X. Let b, r  N

with (r, b) = 1. Let am, bn be complex sequences such that |am|, |bn|  1. Assume that logA+1 X

Let y = r logA X. By assumption we have y2  X/(r logA X). Note that h|n (h) = log n. Hence we can deal the first sum and the second sum with Lemma 4.1. We deal the third sum with Lemma 4.5.
Since we have requirement q/(q, r)  X/(r2 logA+1 X) in Lemma 4.5, estimate (4.3) does not hold for entire minor arcs. Therefore we need the following lemma, which follows from the proof of [BW13, Theorem 2] (Particularly, the condition | - a/q|  1/q comes from [BW13, Lemma 2.1]).

14

Lemma 4.7. Let X  1,   [0, 1] and a, q  N be such that | - a/q|  1/q. Let b, r  N be such that (b, r) = 1. Write  :=  - a/q. Then

We rewrite the previous lemma in the following more suitable form.

Lemma 4.8. Let X  1. Let b, r  N be such that (b, r) = (q, r) = 1. Write  :=  - a/q and assume that ||  1/q. Then

Proof. Set q = qr/(a, r), a = a/(a, r) and  = /r. The claim now follows from Lemma 4.7 as q/h = q, [q, r] = qr and  = /r.

Using the previous lemmas we now prove the following important lemma.

Lemma 4.9. Let  > 0, A, C > 0, X > 1 and   mA+1,X/r. Let b, r  N with (b, r) = 1. Assume that r  X1/3-. Then

V: q < r logA X and (r, q) = 1.

Case I: By definition we have   MA+1,X/r, provided that B < A. So this case cannot actually occur.
Case II: Follows from Lemma 4.6, provided that A is large enough depending on B and C. Case III: Follows from Lemma 4.6, provided that A is large enough depending on C.

Using Lemma 4.9 we can now give sufficient upper bound for (4.2). Proposition 4.10. Let A  1 and  > 0. Let N, r  N be such that r  (N r)1/3-. Then

5 Error term

In this section, we prove two error term estimates. The first one follows from Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem.
Lemma 5.1. Let A, B, N > 0. Let q  N with q  logA N . Let R  (RN )1/2/ logA+B+5 N . Then

|Eqr(rN )|
rR



RN logB N

Proof. By the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem (See e.g. [Ten15, Theorem 8.34])

|Eqr(rN )|
rR



|Eqr(RN )|
rR



|Er(RN )|
rR logA N



r(RN )1/2/ logB+5 N

|Er(RN )|



RN logB N

.

For the proof of the second error term estimate we need information about zeros of Dirichlet L-functions L(s, ). By [IK04, Theorem 5.24] and [IK04, Theorem 10.4] we have the following density lemma.
16

Lemma 5.2. Let 1/2    1 and  > 0. Let r  N. There exists D = D() > 0 such that

Define

Lemma 5.3. Let E > 0 and Q, N > 1. Then,

|ZE(N, Q)|  min N , Q logD N ,

for any  > 0 and for some D > 0 depending on E. Proof. First, using [IK04, Theorem 10.4], we see that

|ZE(N, Q)| 

1

hN/Q qQ  (mod qh) L(,)=0  primitive DE



1

qQ hN  (mod h) L(,)=0  primitive DE
 Q logD N,

for some D > 0 depending on E. Similarly, we have

for any  > 0.

Using Lemma 5.2, we can now prove the second error term estimate.

Lemma 5.4. Let E,  > 0. Let X  3 and d  X5/12- be such that, for all h|d, we have

h  ZE(X) 1. Then
