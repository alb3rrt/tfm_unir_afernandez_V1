1. Introduction

In this paper we consider an infinite class of ordinary difference equations of the form

s-1

s-1

yn+1

yn+j - H (s) = yn+s

yn+j+2 - H (s) s  2.

(1)

j=0

j=0

Each of equations (1) can be rewritten in the form

yn+s+1 = R(yn, . . . , yn+s; H(s)),

where R is corresponding rational function of its arguments.

Equations of the form (1) appeared in [10]. They are interesting in that they share

the property of having a Lax pair that indicates their possible Liouville integrability.

In [11], we have shown a method for constructing a set of the first integrals for these

equations and also for a wider class of integrable difference equation regardless of their

Lax representation. It was shown in [10] that, assuming that yn's depend on evolutionary

parameters (t1, t2, . . .), equations (1) play the role of compatible constraints for the Volterra lattice

yn t1

=

yn (yn+1 - yn-1)

and its hierarchy of generalized symmetries that can be written as [10]

yn ts

=

yn (Sss(n - s + 2) - Sss(n - s))

s  2.

One of the aims of this paper is to prove the fact that an arbitrary solution of equation (1) corresponding to the simplest case s = 2, that is,

yn+1 yn + yn+1 - H (2) = yn+2 yn+2 + yn+3 - H (2)

(2)

is also a solution of equation (1) for all s  3. Also we construct some concrete solution for these equations that in fact is generated by second-order linear recurrent relations.
The paper is organized as follows. In the following section, using different integrals and substitutions, we show some difference equations closely related to our equations under investigation. Also, the aim of the following section is to prove the fact that any solution to equation (2) is simultaneously a solution to equation (1) for all s  3. Section 3 is devoted to the construction of a solution or, more precisely, to a certain class of solutions for equation (2). First, we construct a solution for the bilinear analogue of this equation and then we get what we need as a consequence of the proved proposition.

2. Main results

To begin with, note that equation (1) has an obvious first integral

s

s-1

G(s) =

yn+j - H (s)

yn+j .

(3)

j=0

j=1

Evidently we can consider this relation as a difference equation of oder s with two parameters G(s) and H(s). It should be noticed, that this equation with H(s) = 0 has appeared in [2]. Less obvious is the first integral [11]

s

G(1s) =

yn+j +

yn+j

j=1

which further will be useful for us.

Lemma 1 By (3), the first integral G(1s) can be rewritten as

s-1

s-1

s-1

G(1s) =

yn+j G(s) - yn+j + H (s) yn+j.

(4)

j=0

j=0

Proof. By direct calculation.

With the substitution yn = wnwn+1 equation (3) becomes

s
wn+jwn+j+1 =
j=0

s-1 j=1

G(s) wn+j wn+j+1

+

H (s).

(5)

By direct calculation, it can be checked that this equation has 2-integral

s
n(s) = wn+j -
j=0

G(s)

s-1 j=1

wn+j

.

(6)

Indeed, by (5), we have

s-1

s-1

n(s+) 1 =

wn+j H (s) -

wn+jwn+j+1 and n(s+) 2 = n(s).

Lemma 2 The relation

n(s)n(s+) 1 = G(1s) - H (s)G(s)

(8)

is valid.

Proof. By (6) and (7), we have

n(s)n(s+) 1 = =

s
wn+j -
j=0

G(s)

s-1 j=1

wn+j

s-1

wn+j wn+j+1

j=1

j=0

s-1

H (s) -

(9)

j=0

On the other hand, with the substitution yn = wnwn+1, (4) becomes

s-1

G(1s) =

wn+j wn+j+1

j=0

s-1
G(s) - wn+jwn+j+1
j=0

s-1
+ H (s) wn+jwn+j+1.
j=0

Comparing the latter with (9), in a result, we get relation (8). Let us now rewrite (6) as

s-1

s-1

wn+jwn+j+1 = n(s) wn+j + G(s),

j=0

j=1

n(s+) 2 = n(s).

(10)

This is an ordinary difference equation of order s. In particular case s = 2, it becomes

wnwn2+1wn+2 = n(2)wn+1 + G(2), n(2+)2 = n(2).

(11)

Equation (10) is of interest, because, as was pointed out in [6], it represents an example of U-system [5]. Moreover, it is known by [6] that equation (10), for all s  2, generate Liouville integrable symplectic map.
Here H(s) plays the role of the first integral for difference equation (10). From (7), we derive the following expression for this integral:

s-1

H (s) =

wn+jwn+j+1 +

j=0

n(s+) 1

s-1 j=1

wn+j

.

(12)

Lemma 3 By (10), the first integral (12) can be rewritten as

s-2

H (s) =

wn+jwn+j+1 +

j=0

n(s)

s-2 j=0

wn+j

+

+

s-2 j=0

G(s) wn+j wn+j+1

.

n(s+) 1

s-1 j=1

wn+j

(13)

Proof. By direct calculation. In particular, in the case s = 2, (13) becomes

H (2)

=

wnwn+1

+

n(2) wn

+

n(2+) 1 wn+1

+

G(2) wnwn+1

.

Notice that, provided that {wn} is a solution of equation (11) such that 0(2) = 1(2), the point (wn, wn+1) lies on an elliptic curve described by
x2y2 - H(2)xy + 0(2) (x + y) + G(2) = 0.
One can check that with the substitution wn = fnfn+2/fn2+1 equation (10) can be rewritten in bilinear form [6]

fnfn+s+2 = n(s)fn+1fn+s+1 + G(s)fn+2fn+s, n(s+) 2 = n(s).

(15)

In particular, if s = 2, then (15) becomes

fnfn+4 = n(2)fn+1fn+3 + G(2)fn2+2, n(2+)2 = n(2).

(16)

At this point, it seems appropriate to make a few bibliographic remarks. Equation (16) represents a slight generalization of the Somos-4 equation

fnfn+4 = fn+1fn+3 + fn2+2,

(17)

that generate, for example, the sequence of positive integers that begins with (1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 23, 59, . . .). Despite the fact that, generally speaking, this recurrence relation must generate a sequence of fractional numbers, they all turns out to be integers. A proof of integrity of this sequence known as the Somos-4 sequence can be found in [4]. It has now become clear that the reason for integrity of this sequence lies in the fact that equation (17) has a Laurent property. In this connection, it is appropriate to mention here the relationship of equation (17) to cluster algebras [3].
One of the properties of equation (15) is that it has also the Laurent property (cf. [6]), that means that fn  Z[0(2), 0(2), f0±1, . . . , fs±+11] for any n  s + 2. The Laurent property for equation (15), in fact, follows, as a special case, from this property for the Hirota-Miwa equation [8].
In the sequel we need the following lemma.

Lemma 4 Any solution {wn} to equation (11) is also a solution of the equation

wnwn2+1wn2+2wn+3 = n(3)wn+1wn+2 + G(3)

(18)

with

0(3) = 1(3) = -G(2) and G(3) = G(12) = 0(2)1(2) + G(2)H (2). In addition, in these circumstances, we have H(3) = H(2).

(19)

Proof. Provided that {wn} is any solution of equation (11), for some values of 0(2), 1(2) and G(2), we get the following:

wnwn2+1wn+2 · wn+1wn2+2wn+3 = n(2)wn+1 + G(2)

n(2+) 1wn+2 + G(2)

= n(2)n(2+) 1wn+1wn+2 + G(2) n(2)wn+1 + n(2+) 1wn+2

+ G(2) 2 .

Taking into account (14), we get

wnwn2+1wn2+2wn+3 = -G(2)wn+1wn+2 + n(2)n(2+)1 + G(2)H (2) .

On solutions for some class of integrable difference equations

Whence it follows that if {wn} satisfies equation (11), then it also satisfies (18) with corresponding coefficients given by (19).
Moreover, by (11) and (12), we have

H (3)

-

H (2)

=

wn+2wn+3

+

n(3+) 1 wn+1wn+2

-

n(2+) 1 wn+1

=

n(2+) 1 wn+1

+

G(2) wn+1wn+2

+

n(3+) 1 wn+1wn+2

-

n(2+) 1 wn+1

.

The latter is zero by (19). Therefore this lemma is proved.
Let us notice that equation (18) is not a simple consequence of equation (11), as it may seem at the first glance, since G(3) depends not only on coefficients of equation (11) but also on H(2), that is, these coefficients depend on the solution itself. Also, it should be noted that n(3) do not depend on n provided that {wn} is a solution of equation (11).

Proposition 1 Any solution {wn} to equation (11) is also a solution to equation (10) for any s  4 with suitable coefficients 0(s), 1(s) and G(s). These coefficients are defined
by the following recurrent relations:

n(s+2)

=

G(s+1) G(s)

n(s)

and

G(s+2)

=

G(1s+1)

-

G(s+1) G(s)

G(1s)

s  2,

(20)

where G(1s) = G(s)H(s) + 0(s)1(s). In addition, the first integrals H(s) are defined by the recurrent relation

H (s+2)

=

H (s+1)

+

G(s+1) G(s)

s  2.

(21)

The proof of this proposition is quite technical and cumbersome and therefore we carried

it to Appendix. Evidently recurrent relations (20) and (21) supplemented by (19) unambiguously define coefficients 0(s), 1(s), G(s), for all s  4 as rational functions of 0(2), 1(2), G(2) and H(2). Moreover, from lemma 4 and proposition 1, we get the fact that, provided {wn} is any solution of equation (11), we have 0(s) = 1(s) for all odd
s  3. It is easy to derive the following recurrence relation:

G(1s+2)

=

G(1s+1)H (s+1)

+

G(s+1) G(s)

G(1s+1) - G(1s)H (s+1)

-

G(s+1) G(s)

2
G(s)H(s) s  2.

(22)

As a consequence of lemma 4 and proposition 1, we get the following proposition.

Proposition 2 1) Any solution {yn} to equation (2) is also a solution to equation (1) for s = 3 with H(3) = H(2). The first integrals, in this case, are expressed via G(2), G(12) and H(2) as G(3) = G(12) and G(13) = G(12)H (2) + G(2) 2 ,
where

G(2) = y1 y0 + y1 + y2 - H(2)

On solutions for some class of integrable difference equations

6

and G(12) = y0y1y2 + y12 y0 + y1 + y2 - H(2) ;
2) any solution {yn} to equation (2) is also a solution to equation (1) for all s  4, where H(s) is defined by recurrent relation (21) supplemented by (22) and the second relation in (20).
It is evident that, under the condition of proposition 2, H(s), for all s  4, are unambiguously expressed as a rational function of variables (y0, y1, y2, H(2)).

3. Construction of solution for difference equations

In this section, we give an example of a solution for equation (11). To this aim, let us define the sequence {Tn : n  0} by linear recurrent relations

T2n = P0T2n-1 + QT2n-2 and T2n+1 = P1T2n + QT2n-1 n  1

(23)

with arbitrary initial conditions, where P0, P1 and Q are supposed to be arbitrary numbers. It is obvious that Tn can be written as a linear combination Tn = c0Nn + c1Dn, where Dn = Dn(P0, P1, Q) and Nn = Nn(P0, P1, Q) are some polynomials of corresponding variables. For example,

D0 = 0, D1 = 1, D2 = P0, D3 = P0P1 + Q, D4 = P0 (P0P1 + 2Q) , . . .

and

N0 = 1, N1 = 0, N2 = Q, N3 = QP1, N4 = Q (P0P1 + Q) , . . .

To clarify the meaning of these polynomials, for any P0, P1 and Q, let us consider the following 2-periodic "continued fraction":

C

=

P0

+

P1

+

Q Q Q
P0 + P1

Q +···

(24)

and its convergents

C2

=

Q, P0

C3

=

P0

Q +

Q P1

,

C4

=

P0

+

Q P1

Q +

Q P0

,...

Then, as is known, Cn = Nn/Dn n  2. Of course, R is literally a continued fraction

only if P0, P1 and Q are integers. For the polynomials Dn(P0, P1, Q) and Nn(P0, P1, Q), one knows the following (see,
for example, [1]). The polynomial D2n/P0 and D2n+1, for any n  1, are in fact homogeneous polynomial in P0P1 and Q. Moreover, the sequence {Dn : n  0} is a divisibility sequence. This fact can be illustrated by the formula

Dn = d(P0P1, Q),
d|n

On solutions for some class of integrable difference equations

7

where, for example,

1 = 1, 2 = P0, 3 = P0P1 + Q, 4 = P0P1 + 2Q, 5 = P02P12 + 3P0P1Q + Q2, 6 = P0P1 + 3Q, . . .

Let us define the sequence of polynomials Un = Un(L, M) by recurrence relations

U2n = U2n-1 - M U2n-2 and U2n+1 = LU2n - M U2n-1 n  1

(25)

with U0 = 0 and U1 = 1. For example,

U2 = 1, U3 = L - M, U4 = L - 2M, U5 = L2 - 3LM + M 2, . . .

It is known [1] that

Dn(P0, P1, Q) =

Un(P0P1, -Q), if n odd P0Un(P0P1, -Q), if n even

and

Nn+1(P0, P1, Q) =

QUn(P0P1, -Q), if n odd QP1Un(P0P1, -Q), if n even.

Thus, we have Nn+1(P0, P1, Q) = QDn(P1, P0, Q). To prepare the ground to prove proposition 3 below, let us formulate a lot of

lemmas. The following lemma and its proof is quite standard and can most likely be

found somewhere in the literature.

Lemma 5 By (23), the polynomials Tn satisfy the identity

T2n+2s = D2s+2T2n-1 + QD2s+1T2n-2

(26)

and

T2n+2s+1

=

P1 P0

D2s+2T2n

+

QD2s+1T2n-1

for all s  0.

(27)

Proof. Let us prove identity (26) by induction on s. To this aim, let us suppose that relations (26) and (27) is valid for some s  0. Further we use the fact that the polynomials Dn are defined by relations (23) with initial conditions D0 = 0 and D1 = 1. By the first relation in (23), we have

T2n+2s+2 = P0T2n+2s+1 + QT2n+2s

= P0

P1 P0

D2s+2T2n

+

QD2s+1T2n-1

+ Q (D2s+2T2n-1 + QD2s+1T2n-2)

= P1D2s+2T2n + Q (P0D2s+1 + D2s+2) T2n-1 + Q2D2s+1T2n-2

= P1D2s+2 (QT2n-2 + P0T2n-1) + Q (P0D2s+1 + D2s+2) T2n-1 + Q2D2s+1T2n-2

= (P0 (P1D2s+2 + QD2s+1) + QD2s+2) T2n-1

+ Q (P1D2s+2 + QD2s+1) T2n-2

= D2s+4T2n-1 + QD2s+3T2n-2.

On solutions for some class of integrable difference equations

Thus, we have proved that if relations (26) and (27) are valid for some s  0, then (26) is also valid for s + 1. Relations (26) and (27), for s = 0, are evidently valid by the condition of the lemma. Thus, by induction on s, we prove this lemma. Identity (27) can be proved by analogy.
We actually need the following consequence of this lemma. Since {Dn} represents a particular solution of linear equations (23), then from (26), as a particular case, we derive the following relation:

D2n+2s = D2s+2D2n-1 + QD2s+1D2n-2

(28)

for all s  0 and n  1. As a consequence of (28) we get the following lemma.

Lemma 6 The polynomials Dr(P0, P1, Q) satisfy the identity

Dr (Dr+3 - QDr+1) = Dr+2 (Dr+1 - QDr-1) r  1.

(29)

Proof. Indeed, assuming n = k + 2, s = k - 1 and n = k + 1, s = k in (28), we derive the identities

D4k+2 = D2kD2k+3 + QD2k-1D2k+2 = D2k+1D2k+2 + QD2kD2k+1
that gives (29) for r = 2k. In turn, assuming n = s = k + 1 and n = k + 2, s = k with some k  1 in (28), we derive the identities

D4k+4 = D2k+1D2k+4 + QD2kD2k+3 = D2k+2D2k+3 + QD2k+1D2k+2
that gives (29) for r = 2k + 1. The following lemma plays crucial role for constructing some class of solutions for
difference equation (10).

Lemma 7 An arbitrary sequence {Tn : n  0} determined by a pair of linear equations (23) is also a solution of bilinear equation (16), provided that

n(2)

=

-

Pn2 Q

and

G(2)

=

P0P1 + Q

Q.

(30)

Moreover, we have

H (2)

=

-P0P1 + Q

2Q .

(31)

Proof. This lemma can be proved by direct but quite cumbersome calculations. It should be noted that the parameters 0(2), 1(2) and G(2) in (30) do not depend on
c0 and c1.
As a consequence of lemma 7, we derive the following two identities:

P02DsDs+2 = (P0P1 + Q) Ds2+1 - QDs-1Ds+3  odd s  1

(32)

and

P12DsDs+2 = (P0P1 + Q) Ds2+1 - QDs-1Ds+3  even s  2.

(33)

Lemma 8 The relations

QDsDs+1 (Ds+1Ds+4 - Ds+2Ds+3) + Ds+2Ds+3 (DsDs+3 - Ds+1Ds+2)

+ P02Ds3+1Ds+3 - P12DsDs3+2 = 0  even s  2

(34)

and

QDsDs+1 (Ds+1Ds+4 - Ds+2Ds+3) + Ds+2Ds+3 (DsDs+3 - Ds+1Ds+2)

+ P12Ds3+1Ds+3 - P02DsDs3+2 = 0  odd s  1

(35)

are identities.

Proof. Let us prove only (35), By (32), for all odd s  1, we have

P12Ds3+1Ds+3 - P02DsDs3+2 = Ds2+1 (P0P1 + Q)Ds2+2 - QDsDs+4 - Ds2+2 (P0P1 + Q)Ds2+1 - QDs-1Ds+3
= Q Ds-1Ds2+2Ds+3 - DsDs2+1Ds+4 .
Taking the latter into account, we can rewrite (35) as

QDsDs+1 (Ds+1Ds+4 - Ds+2Ds+3) + Ds+2Ds+3 (DsDs+3 - Ds+1Ds+2) + Q Ds-1Ds2+2Ds+3 - DsDs2+1Ds+4 = 0
or quite simply as QJs-1 + Js = 0, where, by definition, Js = DsDs+3 - Ds+1Ds+2. But the latter is nothing but identity (29), which has already been proven. Identity (34) can be proved using similar reasoning.
It follows, from lemma 7, that the sequence {wn = TnTn+2/Tn2+1 : n  0} represents a particular solution of equation (11). In turn, by proposition 1, we know that this sequence is also a solution of equation (10) for all s  3. More exactly, we have the following proposition.

Proposition 3 The sequence {wn = TnTn+2/Tn2+1 : n  0} is a particular solution of equation (10), for any s  2, provided that the parameters 0(s), 1(s) and G(s) are given by

0(s)

=

-

P0Ds QDs-1

,

1(s)

=

  
 

0(s), if

P12 P02

0(s)

,

s odd if s even

In addition we have

and

G(s) =

Ds+1 QDs-1

.

(36)

H(s) = -G(s) + s + 1.

(37)

Proof. To begin with, we note that formulas (36) and (37), in the case s = 2, give

what we have in (30) and (31). Moreover, by (19), we get

0(3)

=

1(3)

=

-

P0

P1 + Q

Q

and

G(3)

=

P0P1 + Q

2Q

and this corresponds to (36) for s = 3. Also, one can check that the equality H(3) = H(2)

is in accordance to (37). It remains to check that the substitution of (36) and (37) into

recurrent relations (20) and (21) in proposition 1 gives identities.

On solutions for some class of integrable difference equations

10

It is easy to check that substituting 0(s) and 1(s) given by (36) into (20) gives trivial identities. In turn, substituting (37) into (21) yields the relation

G(s+1)

=

G(s)

-

G(s) G(s-1)

+

1.

Expressing here G(s) via Ds as in (36), we get the identity (29) that has already proven. So it remains to check the fulfillment of the second recurrent relation in (20). One can

make sure that substituting (36) and (37) into this relation, in a result, gives identities

(34) and (35) that has already proven.

Proposition 3 implies the following two propositions.

Proposition 4 The polynomials Dn(P0, P1, Q) satisfy the following identities:

QDs-1DnDn+s+2 + P0DsDn+1Dn+s+1 - Ds+1Dn+2Dn+s = 0

for all odd s  1 and all n  0 and for all even s  2 and all even n  0;

QP0Ds-1DnDn+s+2 + P12DsDn+1Dn+s+1 - P0Ds+1Dn+2Dn+s = 0 for all even s  2 and all odd n  1.

Proposition 5 The sequence {yn = TnTn+3/(Tn+1Tn+2) : n  0} is a solution of the equation (1) with parameter H(s) given by (37) for all s  2.

At the end of this section, we would like to give examples of the sequence

{Tn : n  0}. Let, for example, P0 = P1 = Q = 1. Then recurrent relations (23) is reduced to the relation Tn+2 = Tn+1 + Tn, that defines generalized Fibonacci numbers. In particular, if T0 = 0 and T1 = 1, then Tn = Dn = Fn, where Fn's are the Fibonacci numbers. In turn, if T0 = 2 and T1 = 1, then Tn = 2Nn + Dn = Ln , where Ln's are Lucas numbers. Evidently, that Ln = Fn + 2Fn-1.
Continued fraction (24), in this case, becomes

is well known as a golden section.

The sequence of convergents of

C, in this case, are expressed via the Fibonacci numbers as Cn = Fn-1/Fn.

More generally, let P0 = P1 = P . Let P and Q be relatively prime integers such

that discriminant D = P 2 + 4Q = 0 of the characteristic equation x2 - P x - Q = 0 is

not zero. Let a and b be algebraic numbers such that a + b = P and ab = -Q. Finally,

if a ratio a/b is not a root of unity then a Lukas sequence and its companion are defined

as [7]

Dn

- -

bn b

and

2Nn + P Dn = an + bn,

respectively.

Also as a special case, the sequence {Tn : n  0} contains a Lehmer sequence, which, to a certain extent, has already been mentioned above. Let P0 = 1. Let us denote P1 = L and Q = -M. Then linear recurrent relations (23) reduce to relations (25). Let L and M be relatively prime integers such that D = L - 4M =0, while a and b be algebraic numbers that are roots of the characteristic equation x2 - Lx + M = 0, that is, L = (a + b)2 and M = ab. In addition, let us suppose that the quotient a/b is not a root of unity, then the Lehmer sequence is defined as [7]


   Dn =
  

an a

- -

bn b

,

an a2

- -

bn b2

,

if n odd if n even.

To define a companion Lehmer sequence one needs to put P0 = L, P1 = 1 and Q = -M.

Then


 2Nn + Dn =

if n odd

 an + bn, if n even.

4. Final remarks

Difference equations (1) represent a subclass of two-parametric class of equations [10]

yn+kS~sk(n) = yn+sS~sk(n + 2) k  1, s  k + 1.

(38)

A precise description of these equations is as follows. Discrete polynomial S~sk(n) here can be written as follows:

k
S~sk(n) = (-1)j Hj(k,s)Ssk--jj(n + j),
j=0

where Hj(k,s) are some parameters and H0(k,s) = 1. As for discrete polynomials Ssk(n), they are defined as follows:

Ssk(n) =

yn+q1+k-1 · · · yn+qk .

0q1···qks-1

Actual calculations suggest that proposition 2 can be expanded to this class of equations.

More exactly, we suppose that any solution to equation (2) is at the same time a solution

to equation (38), for all k  1 and s  k + 1, provided that we restrict these parameters

appropriately. Moreover we suppose that this constraint looks like that

k-1

Hk(k,s) =

aj(k,s)Hj(k,s) + b(k,s),

j=1

where the coefficients aj(k,s) and b(k,s) are some rational functions of variables (y0, y1, y2, H(2)). In the future, we intend to continue our investigation in this direction.

Appendix A.

Let us prove here proposition 1, by induction. For any s  4, by (10), we have

s-1

s-1

wn+j wn+j+1 · wn+j+1wn+j+2

j=0

j=0

s-1
= n(s) wn+j + G(s)

wn+jwn+j+1 + G(s)

j=1

j=2

n(s)wn+1 + n(s+) 1wn+s

+ G(s) 2 .

We can rewrite (13) as

s

n(s)wn+1 + n(s+) 1wn+s = H (s)

wn+j -

j=1

G(s)

s-1 j=2

wn+j

wn+j wn+j +1 .

j=1

Taking the latter into account, we get

+ G(s) 2 .

From this follows the fact that if {wn} satisfies equation (10), for some s  4, then it satisfies also the equation

s
wn+jwn+j+1 =
j=0

n(s)n(s+) 1 + G(s)H (s)

s-1

- G(s)

wn+j wn+j +1.

j=1

(A.1)

Let us now assume that {wn} is also a solution to (s - 1)-th equation (10). From (10) and (12), we derive the following relation:

s-1

wn+j wn+j+1

=

H (s-1)

+

n(s-1) G(s-1)

s

n(s+-11) -

wn+j

.

j=1

j=1

(A.2)

Substituting (A.2) into (A.1), yields

s
wn+jwn+j+1 =
j=0

n(s)n(s+) 1 + G(s)H (s)

n(s-1) G(s-1)

s
= n(s+1) wn+j + G(s+1),
j=1

s

n(s+-11) -

where

n(s+1)

=

G(s) G(s-1)

n(s-1)

(A.3)

and

G(s+1)

=

n(s)n(s+) 1

+

G(s)H (s)

-

G(s) G(s-1)

n(s-1)n(s+-11) + G(s-1)H (s-1)

.

In a result, we get the following fact. If {wn} is a solution to (s - 1)-th and s-th equation (10) simultaneously, then it is a solution to (s + 1)-th equation. On the other

hand, from lemma 4 we know that if {wn} is a solution of equation (11) then it is also a solution of equations (18). It makes a base of induction. Thus, we are in a position

to prove the main part of proposition 1 by induction on s.

Let us now prove relation (21). Further we use already proven fact that under the

condition of proposition 1, the sequence {wn} is a solution to the equation (10), for any s  3, with corresponding coefficients. Then, we have

H (s+1) - H (s) = wn+swn+s+1 + By (10), we can write

n(s++11)

s j=1

wn+j

-

n(s+) 1

s-1 j=1

wn+j

.

wn+swn+s+1 =

n(s+) 1

s-1 j=1

wn+j

+

s-1 j=1

G(s) wn+j wn+j+1

.

(A.4)

Taking into account relations (A.3) and (A.4), we have

H (s+1) - H (s) =

G(s)

s-1 j=1

wn+j wn+j+1

1

+

n(s+-11) G(s-1)

s-1

wn+j

j=2

.

Again, by (10),

1

+

n(s+-11) G(s-1)

s-1
wn+j

=

j=2

s-1 j=1

wn+j

wn+j

+1

G(s-1)

and using the latter we get (21).
