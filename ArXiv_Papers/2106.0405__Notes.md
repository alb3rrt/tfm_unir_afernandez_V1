## Abstract

Co-prime sampling is a strategy for acquiring the signal below the Nyquist rate. The prototype and extended co-prime samplers require two low rate sub-samplers. One of the sub-samplers in the extended co-prime scheme is not utilized for every alternate co-prime period. Therefore, this paper proposes a time multiplexing strategy to utilize the vacant slots. It describes the deviation from the existing theory. Closed-form expressions for weight functions are provided. Acquisition of two signals is described with three samplers as well as two samplers. A generalized structure is also proposed with an extremely sparse co-prime sampling strategy.
