ON AN INTEGRAL REPRESENTATION OF THE NORMALIZED TRACE OF THE k-TH SYMMETRIC TENSOR POWER OF MATRICES AND SOME APPLICATIONS
HASSAN ISSA, HASSAN ABBAS, AND BASSAM MOURAD
ABSTRACT. Let A be an n О n matrix and let kA be its k-th symmetric tensor product. We express the normalized trace of kA as an integral of the k-th powers of the numerical values of A over the unit sphere Sn of Cn with respect to the normalized Euclidean surface measure. Equivalently, this expression in turn can be interpreted as an integral representation for the (normalized) complete symmetric polynomials over Cn. As applications, we present a new proof for the MacMahon Master Theorem in enumerative combinatorics. Then, our next application deals with a generalization of the work of Cuttler et al. in [10] concerning the monotonicity of products of complete symmetric polynomials. In the process, we give a solution to an open problem that was raised by I. RovenИta and L. E. Temereanca in [31].

1. INTRODUCTION

Given A in the space of all n О n complex matrices Mn(C), we denote its tace by tr(A) and we shall

write

T r(A)

:=

tr(A) n

for

the

normalized

trace.

It

is

well

known

(

[7, 20])

that

T r(A)

can

be

obtained

via

the

following functional representation

< A,  > d() = T r(A),

(1.1)

Sn

where Sn is the unit sphere of Cn,  is the probability Lebesgue measure on Sn and < и, и > is the standard inner product on Cn. The above formula states that the normalized trace of a matrix is the expectation of the

numerical values of the matrix computed with respect to d. Noting the linearity on both sides of (1.1), one

obtains the above formula by checking it on matrix bases. When linearity is lost due to some perturbation of

the numerical values, new techniques are needed to obtain a reasonable formula. Our main objective inthis

paper is to find the expectation of natural powers of the numerical values computed with respect to d. More

precisely, given two natural numbers n, k  N we aim to find an expression for

< A,  > kd()
Sn

(1.2)

The preceding integral is of special interest notably in the analysis of some reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of analytic functions. More precisely, when addressing the analysis of the Hardy space H2(Sn) over the unit ball B(0, 1) of Cn, we recall that the Szegoе projection PS is the orthogonal projection of L2(Sn) onto H2(Sn) and is given by

f ()

PSf (z) = Sn (1- < v,  >)n d(), for v  B(0, 1).

This integral representation for PS is due to a classical series representation for the reproducing kernel in

terms of an orthonormal basis (cf. [33]). Note that for a fixed v  B(0, 1), if v is the pointwise evaluation

at v then the linear functional v  PS is expressed as an infinite series of integral (scalar valued) operators

of the form

cn,k (< v,  >)kf ()d(),
Sn

where cn,k =

n+k-1 k

.

Thus,

it

is

natural

to

refer

to

such

operators

as

the

"building

blocks"

for

the

Szegoе

projection. In order to clarify the connection of such analysis to our work, we consider a collection of integral

transforms {T } A,k AMn(C),kN on L2(Sn) defined by

TA,kf (х) = (< Aх,  >)kf ()d(), for f  L2(Sn), х  Sn.
Sn

(1.4)

Let e1 = (1, 0, и и и , 0)  Cn, then {TA,kf (e1)}AMn(C) provides a generalization for the "building blocks"

of PS. Indeed, given a non-zero v  B(0, 1) consider A = v 2U where и 2 is the Euclidean norm and U

is a unitary matrix satisfying U e1 =

v v

2

,

then

TA,kf (e1) = (< v,  >)kf ()d().
Sn

It is easy to see that TA,k is a finite rank operator and apparently the permutation in the х-coordinate might not allow us to get a canonical decomposition of TA,k for general A. This in turn leads to difficulties in computing the trace of TA,k. Alternatively, as the kernel (< Aх,  >)k is continuous in the х and  variables then the trace of TA,k is given by (1.2). A similar argument holds for the Hilbert-Schmidt norm и (2) of TA,k which in support of our line of investigation, turns out to satisfy the following identity;

Sn

(1.5)

In this paper, we shall use matrix analysis techniques to find the integral (1.2) and then we apply our results

to enumerative combinatorics. More explicitly, our main objective is to prove the following main result.

Theorem 1.1.

Let A



Mn(C) and let k



N.

Denote by T r(kA)

=

tr(k A) cn,k

the normalized trace of the

k-th symmetric power of A then

< A,  > kd() = T r(kA).
Sn

(1.6)

Since T r(kA) is simply the evaluation of the normalized complete k-homogenous polynomials Hk at the eigenvalues of A, the preceding integral can be then interpreted as a representation for such polynomials. A direct consequence of the preceding equation is the positivity of H2k on Rn which has been proved by D. B. Hunter in [15]. A simpler proof to this fact that is based on Schur convexity of the complete symmetric
polynomials, was obtained by I. Rovena and L. E. Temereanca in [31]. However, we believe that in the

context of our work, we offer the simplest proof among the previously mentioned work. In connection with the analysis of symmetric polynomials, we recall that the Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-

Zuber integral which was used by S. Sra in [35] to express the normalized Schur polynomials. Via such a representation together with a technique of Schur's convexity, the author in [35] presented the sufficiency for

a conjecture that was proposed in [10] on the monotonicity (via a lexicographic order) for (a product of) normalized Schur polynomials. More explicitly, in [10] the authors presented many inequalities for symmetric
2

functions and in particular, they proved the monotonicity for (a product of) normalized complete symmetric polynomials on Rn+. Another consequence of our results lies in exploiting our integral representation together with a result due Y. L. Tong [38] on Schur convexity to prove that this monotonicity holds also for (a product of) normalized complete symmetric polynomials of even degrees on Rn not only on Rn+.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to proving our main theorem. In Section 3 we
provide a new proof for Macmahon Master Theorem and we obtain an integral representation for a particular
determinant. In the last section, we present a generalization to the monotonicity result in [10] and in the
process, we give a solution to an open problem that was raised in [31].

2. INTEGRAL FORMULA FOR THE TRACE OF SYMMETRIC POWERS
There is a natural way to provide an exact formula for (1.2) by integrating polynomials over the unit sphere of arbitrary dimensional complex spaces. For this reason, it is more convenient to use the standard notation from the theory of complex analysis of several variables. For a multi-index  = (1, 2, и и и , n)  Nn0 of non-negative integers and for z  Cn, we shall write

z = (z1, z2, и и и , zn), z = z11 .z22 и и и znn , || = 1 + 2 + и и и + n, and ! = 1!2! и и и n!.

In connection to matrix analysis, given A = (aij)  Mn(C) we denote by a := vec(AT ) the vectorization of its transpose i.e. a is the vector obtained by stacking the rows of A on top of each other (cf. [16, 17]) so that
a = (a11, a12, и и и , a1n, a21, a22 и и и , a2n, и и и , an1, и и и , ann)T  Cn2.

Whenever   Mn2(N0), we will not distinguish between its matrix form and its representation vec(T )  Nn02. For example, given A = (aij)  Mn(C) and  = (ij)  Mn2 (N0) we write || = ij ij and

n2

a =

aijij .

i,j

Preliminary to our consideration of the integral formula, we shall express the integrand in (1.2) using the above notation.

Proposition 2.1. Let A  Mn(C) and k  N. Given z  Cn, the following holds:

< Az, z >

k
=
||=k Mn2 (N0)

k az 

z i i1, i i2,иии , i in

where

Remark 2.1. Suppose that A is an upper triangular matrix then the sum on the right hand side of (2.1) reduces to those   Mn2(N0) satisfying || = k and  is only upper triangular. Indeed, if i0j0 = 0 for certain i0 > j0 then as A is upper triangular we have a = 0.
Due to the orthogonality of the monomials on L2(Sn), a natural condition is then employed on the row sums as well as the column sums of   Mn2(N0) when integrating (2.1). The next lemma examines the type of  under such condition.

Lemma 2.1. Let   Mn2(N0) be an upper triangular matrix satisfying the condition:

n

n

il = lj for every l = 1, 2 и и и , n,

(2.2)

i=1

j=1

then  is a diagonal matrix.

Proof. We shall proceed by induction. For l = 1, we have 11 = 11 +

n j=2

1j

so

that

1j

=

0

for

all

j = 2, и и и n. Assume that for all k  l0 we have kj = 0 whenever j = k. By (2.2) the (l0 + 1) column

sum of  satisfies

n

n

i,l0+1 =

l0+1,j

i=1

j=1

Notice that,

n

n

n

i,l0+1 =

i,l0+1 +l0+1,l0+1 +

i,l0+1

i=1

il0 =0

i>l0+1 =0

The first sum on the right hand side of the above equation vanishes by making se of the induction hypothesis

and the second sum vanishes as  is upper triangular. Similarly, by using the fact that  is upper triangular

we get

n

n

n

l0+1,j =

l0+1,j +l0+1,l0+1 +

l0+1,j .

j=1

jl0 =0

j >l0 +1

We conclude that
n

l0+1,l0+1 = l0+1,l0+1 +

l0+1,j ,

j >l0 +1

which in turn yields that l0+1,j = 0 for all j > l0 + 1. Thus,  is diagonal and the proof is complete.

Now, for our purposes we need a well-known result for the exact value for integration of monomials on spheres. Such explicit value plays an important role in real, complex and harmonic analysis (cf. for example [2, 12, 21]). In particular, for the study of (commuting) Toeplitz operators on the Segal-Bargmann space [5, 18, 19]. A simple proof using complex analysis for the next lemma could be found in [11] and is due to V. Bargmann and E. Nelson as indicated by G.B. Folland in [11] (see also Proposition 1.4.9 in [32]).

Lemma 2.2. Let  be the normalized probability measure on the unit sphere Sn of Cn. For any ,   Nn0

we have

(2.3)

In order to prove our main theorem, we shall follow the notation used in [6] for the symmetric tensor product (or power) of matrices. Recall that, for k  N the symmetric tensor product of Cn, denoted by kCn is the subspace of kCn spanned by all elementary symmetric tensor products x1  x2  и и и  xk of vectors xi  Cn. Given A  Mn(C), we denote by kA the kth-symmetric tensor power of A i.e. kA is the matrix in Mcn,k (C) representing the linear operator kA : kCn - kCn whose first definition on the elementary symmetric tensor product of vectors is given by

k A(x1  x2  и и и  xk) := Ax1  Ax2  и и и  Axk.

(2.4)

Recall that the k-th complete elementary symmetric polynomial with n-complex variables is a homogeneous

polynomial of order k given by

hk(z) =

z,

||=k Nn0

z  Cn.

Here, and in the sequel, if the spectrum sp(A) = {i | i = 1, и и и , n} we shall denote the (un-ordered) n-tuple by  = (A) := (1, 2, и и и , n)  Cn counted with their multiplicities. Using (2.4) it is easy to check that sp(kA) = {i1i2 и и и ik | 1  i1  i2  и и и  ik  n}. This leads to the well-known formula for the trace of kA in terms of 1, 2, и и и , n:

tr(kA) =

i1i2 и и и ik = hk(),

1i1 i2 иииik n

(2.5)

Now we are in a position to prove our main result which is Theorem 1.1. For the sake of the reader, we shall restate it again here as follows.

Theorem 2.1.

Let A



Mn(C) and let k



N.

Denote by T r(kA)

=

tr(k A) cn,k

the normalized trace of the

k-th symmetric power of A, then

< A,  > kd() = T r(kA).
Sn

(2.6)

Proof. Using Schur's decomposition, one can write A = U T U with T upper triangular and U is unitary.

So that the change of variable u = U  provides

< A,  > kd() =

< T U , U  > kd(U u) =

< T u, u > kd(u),

Sn

Sn

Sn

where the last equality follows from the invariance of  under unitary transformation. Thus, we may assume that A is upper triangular and  = (a11, a22, и и и , ann). By Proposition 2.1 and Remark 2.1, we obtain that

is given by

< A,  > kd()
Sn

||=k Mn2 (N0)  upper triangular

Following Lemma 2.2, the preceding integral terms vanishes for all  except when

il = lj, for every l = 1, 2 и и и , n.

By Lemma 2.1,  is a diagonal matrix so that

a = 1 11 2 22 и и и 2 nn = ,
where in the last equality we considered  = (1, 2, и и и , n) = (11, 22, и и и , nn) as an n-tuple in Nn0 . This reduces the preceding integral to the following form

< A,  > kd(u) =

k 

 11,22,иии ,nn (11,22,иии ,nn d().

(2.7)

Formula (2.6) merits (at least a quick) discussion on its important role in the analysis of function spaces. It is trivial that (2.6) generalizes (1.1) from k = 1 to arbitrary k  N. With this in mind, a direct application of ((1.1)) to kA  Mcn,k (C) together with (2.6) provides

< kAх, х > d(х) =

< A,  > kd().

Scn,k

Sn

(2.8)

The above formula can be viewed as a reduction from integrals over Scn,k to integrals over Sn. This leads to various applications in the study of the analysis of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of analytic function over specific domains. For example, the left hand side of (2.8) is the Szegoе projection onto H2(Scn,k ) of
Scn,k  х -< kAх, х >
at z = 0  Ccn,k , while the right hand side is the Szegoе projection onto H2(Sn) of Sn   - < A,  > k

at z = 0  Cn. Another application is connected to the study of the composition of Toeplitz operators on the Segal-Bargmann space. We refer the reader to [1, 4, 9, 19] where integral reduction was frequently used to obtain a composition formula for some classes of Toeplitz operators.
Notice that Formula (2.6) shows that the integral depends on the spectrum of the matrix. However, by expressing the complete symmetric polynomials as power sums we obtain that the integral depends only on moments of the eigenvalues. For this reason, we present the following well-known result on representing the complete symmetric polynomials in terms of power sums.

Lemma 2.3 ( [24] pp. 24-25). Let k  N and let hk(x) =

||=k x. For each r  N put pr(x) =

n i=1

xri

.

Nn

Given a non-zero compactly supported sequence arranged in decreasing order  = (1, 2, и и и , l, 0, 0, 0 и и и ) 

N, define

p(x) = p1(x)p2 (x) и и и pl(x),

with l is the leading entry of . Then,

hk(x) =

z-1 p (x),

||=k

(2.9)

where z = imi mi!
i1
and mi is the number for which i is occurring in .

(2.10)

We shall apply the preceding lemma to express the trace of the symmetric tensor product of a matrix A

in-terms of product of traces of powers of A. Following the notation in the above lemma, Formula (2.6) can

then be reformulated in-terms of the rth-moments of the eigenvalues pr() =

n i=1

as

follows:

12иииk0

(2.11)

Notice that the condition for which   Nk0 is trivial since  is decreasing with || = k. Using the basic fact that the product of traces is the trace of tensor products, Eq. (2.11) can be rewritten as follows

cn,k
Sn

< A,  >

kd() =

(2.12)

where denotes the tensor (Kronecker) product of matrices. With an inspection of equations (2.11) and (2.12) one obtains an "exhaustive behavior" of the l-index of
. Indeed, in both equations there is no-need to worry about i whenever i > l so fixing l will be helpful in
7

computation. Moreover, regarding (2.12) one might be interested in summing up tensor powers of matrices (of same dimension). This also amounts to collecting the multi-indices having the same index in the leading term. For this reason, we consider
Sk := { = (1, 2, и и и , k)  Nk0 | 1  2  и и и  k and || = k}
and for each l = 1, 2, и и и , k we set
Slk = {  Sk | l = 0 and i = 0 for all i > l}.
It is worthy to mention here that {Slk}l=1,2,иии ,k forms a partition for Sk and thus we conclude from the previous discussion the following new formulation of Theorem 2.1.

Corollary 2.1. Let A  Mn(C) and let k  N then the following holds

(2.13) (2.14)

The next example is devoted to finding the explicit value of the integral formula for the cases k = 2, и и и 6. Since going from (2.13) to (2.14) is direct, we shall only apply (2.14) for the cases k = 2 and k = 3.

(2.19)

We conclude this section by noting that Eq. (2.15) can be obtained from Corollary 2.3 and Theorem 2.4 in [7], while to the best of our knowledge Equations (2.16)-(2.19) are new.

3. A NEW PROOF OF MACMAHON MASTER THEOREM

This section is devoted to provide a simple proof for MacMahon Master theory. This theory has been central in combinatorics and in the theory of angular momentum of systems of particles as well. The original proof is due to P. A. MacMahon [25] while another proof depending on complex analysis was provided by I. J. Good in [14]. Our proof seems to be the simplest. Making use of the results in the previous section, let us first present an integral representation of a particular determinant as follows.

Corollary 3.1. Let B  Mn(C) with B 2 = sup x =1 Bx 2 < 1 then

Sn

d() < (In - B),  >

n = det(In - B)-1.

(3.1)

Proof. By Theorem 2.1, we know that for each k  N the following identity holds

n+k-1

Sn

k

< B,  > kd() =

||=k Nn

Since B 2 < 1 the series 1

 n+k-1 k=0 k

< B,  > k converges absolutely and is dominated by

(1 - B 2)n . Hence by Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem we get

 n+k-1

-nd() =

.

det(In - B)

(3.2)

Remark 3.1. Note that the monotone convergence theorem ensures that Eq. (3.1) remains true for any

positive semidefinite matrix B. Also, it is easy to see that for any c  C with |c| > 1 and for any non-zero

matrix A  Mn(C), we have

Sn

d() < (c A 2In - A),  >

n = det(c A 2In - A)-1.

Now, we are ready to present our proof for MacMahon Master theorem.

Theorem 3.1 (MacMahon). Let A = (aij)  Mn(C),   Nn and x = (x1, x2, и и и , xn)T be a formal variable. Then the coefficient of xintheexpressionof Ax  is equal to the coefficient of x in the expansion of det(In - (x)B)-1, where (x) is the diagonal matrix given by (x) = diag(x1,2 , и и и , xn).
Proof. Fork  N and for each   Nn with || = k, denote by c the coefficient of x in Ax . Since  (x)A =  A(x) then by (2.7) we have

hk  (x)A

4. ON THE MONOTONICITY OF COMPLETE SYMMETRIC POLYNOMIALS

In this section, we extend the definition of k-homogeneous complete symmetric polynomials where k  N to arbitrary p  R+. We then exploit the definition to introduce a natural extension for the term-normalized

homogeneous polynomial. Using the theory of majorization, we obtain a Schur convexity of this extension.

As a consequence , we obtain a generalization of Theorem 7.3 in [10] and we answer an open problem raised

in [31] as well.

Throughout this section, we shall follow the standard notation used in the study of symmetric polynomials

and the theory of majorization. Thus, for m-tuples , х  Rm+ we say that  is majorized by х and we will

write  х if

k

j

[i]  х[i], j = 1 и и и n - 1 and || = |х|,

i=1

i=1

where x[i] is the ihe component obtained from x = (x1, и и и , xn) after arranging its components in decreasing order. In the case where х  Rn+ and n < m, then we shall complete the components of х to an m-tuple by

adding zeros so that the preceding notion is still well defined. If  and х are partitions of (possibly different)

natural integers then we shall write

х

if

 ||

х |х| ,

10

For each k  N, we shall denote by Hk to be the normalized complete symmetric polynomial on Cn i.e.

Hk(z)

=

hk(z) . cn,k

(4.1)

Given  = (1, и и и , m)  Nm, the term-normalized homogeneous complete symmetric function is defined on Cn by
m

H(z) = Hi (z).

(4.2)

i-1

In addition, for x  Rn+ and for the map defined by

H(x) := || H(x),

(4.3)

the authors in [10] proved the monotonicity of H on Rn+ as follows.

Theorem 4.1 (Theorem 7.3, [10]). Given integer partitions  and х with   х, then for any x  Rn+ we have

H(x)  Hх(x).

(4.4)

In [35], the author used the Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber (HCIZ) integral to represent the term-normalized Schur polynomials in order to obtain a monotonicity result concerning a conjecture formulated in [10]. As mentioned earlier, we shall next use the integral representation obtained in Section 2 to provide a generalization of the preceding theorem. Our work is based on majorization methods for moments and thus differs from the algebraic approach used in [10]. Since the integrand in HCIZ involves two matrices, the author in [35] was able to express the term-normalized Schur polynomial as a single integral (over the set of unitary matrices). The existence of the exponential term in HCIZ was needed to obtain a Schur convexity result. In our case, the integral is over a finite product of spheres and the integrand is given by powers of numerical values and so many difficulties naturally arise.
For an arbitrary z  Cn, we shall write Z := diag(z1, и и и , zn)  Mn(C). Thus, by (2.5) and (2.6) we have the following representation for the normalized complete symmetric polynomials

Hk(z) =

< Z,  > kd()

Sn

(4.5)

In [15], the author proved that H2k is positive definite on Rn using a differential operator approach and some

identities between symmetric polynomials. Following a post by T. Tao concerning this issue, two proofs

were presented by I. Roventa and L. E. Temereanca for the positivity but still based on polynomial identities

and some computations. In the next corollary, we present our own proof not only for the positivity but also

for the definitness of this property for H2k.

Corollary 4.1. The even degree complete symmetric polynomials are positive definite on Rn.

Proof. Using the representaion (4.5), we know that for any x  Rn we have

H2k(x) =

< X,  > 2kd(),

Sn

(4.6)

where X = diag(x1, и и и , xn) so that positivity is clear. If H2k(x) = 0 then the map

Sn   - < X,  > 2  R+

is equal to zero almost everywhere on Sn. By continuity of the preceding map, we obtain < X,  >= 0 for all   Sn or equivalently x = 0.
11

Motivated by the latter property, we introduce the following definition and we shall use the same notation as in (4.3)

Definition 4.1. Given  = (1, 2, и и и , m)  Nm, let the map H2 be defined on Rn by H2 (x) := 2|| H2 (x).

In the following proposition, we examine the possibility of an extension Formula (4.6) from the case of integer powers to the case of arbitrary real powers.

Proposition 4.1. Let X  Mn(C) be a non-zero positive semidefinite matrix. Then for any p  R, the

integral

< X,  > pd()
Sn

(4.7)

is well defined with values in ]0, [.

Proof. Suppose first that p  0, then clearly the proposition follows from the inequality

< X,  > pd() 

w(X) pd() = w(X) p,

Sn

Sn

where w(и) denotes the numerical radius norm. On the other hand, if p < 0 and if v denotes the Lebesgue

measure on Cn. then we consider the following set

F := z  Cn |< Xz, z >= 0 .

As X  0 and X = 0 then F = ker X which is an intersection of hyperplanes in Cn. So that v(F ) = 0 or equivalently F \{0} is measurable and v(F \{0}) = 0. Next, we consider the set defined by

E :=   Sn |< X,  >= 0 .

By the definition of the sigma-algebra on Sn (cf. for example Chapter 6, Section 3 in [36]), the set E is

measurable if and only if the set

E :=

z



B(0, 1)

|

z

=

0

and

z |z|



E

is Lebesgue measurable in Cn. Notice that by representing z in polar coordinates z = r with r ]0, [ we

obtain

E = B(0, 1)  F \{0}

and hence E is measurable. Let х1 be the corresponding radial measure on (0, ) i.e. х1() =  r2n-1dr for every Lebesgue measurable set  in (0, ). Since F \{0} = (0, ) О E = lN(0, l) О E then

0

=

v(F

\{0})

=

lim
l

х1((0,

l))(E)

=

lim
l

l 2n

(E)

which holds only in the case when (E) = 0. Let f be the map on Sn defined by f () = < X,  > p

with values in [0, ]. As f is real valued continuous function on Ec := Sn\{E} then f is measurable on

Ec and therefore on Sn. Moreover, as E is a null--set then

< X,  > pd() =

< X,  > pEc()d().

Sn

Sn

(4.8)

By the unitary invariance of , one can assume that X is diagonal and the preceding formula remains true.

Indeed, compared to the work in Section 1 the only factor that needs to be examined is Ec. However,
12

writing X = U U with  being diagonal matrix and U  Un then by the invariance of the Euclidean norm under unitary transformation we have

E =   Sn |< X,  >= 0 =   Sn |< U , U  >= 0 =   Sn |< ,  >= 0 ,

where the last equality folllows from th e fact that U is an isometry. The above equation shows that E(U ) = 1 if and only if   Sn and < U , U  >= 0 which is equivalent to say that   E. Therefore, Ec(U ) = Ec() and thus we can assume X = diag(x1, и и и , xn) with x = (X) being a non-zero vector in Rn+. It remains to prove that the value of the integral is strictly positive. For this, we let x = min{xi | xi = 0} and x^ = max{xi | xi = 0} then clearly x > 0, x^ > 0 and
x^p  < X,  > p  xp,

where the above inequality holds for all   Ec. Therefore, by (4.8) we get

x^p 

< X,  > pd()  xp.

Sn

Motivated by the above result, we introduce the following generalization for normalized (and term normalized) complete homogeneous polynomials on Rn+.

Definition 4.2. Let p  R. The p-homogeneous function Hp is the map defined on Rn+ by





Hp(x)

=

Sn
0,

< X,  > pd()

if if

x=0 x = 0,

(4.9)

where X = diag(x1, и и и , xn). In addition, given  = (1, и и и , m)  Rm we define the term-normalized

-function by

m

H(x) = Hi (x).

(4.10)

i=1

In [38], and based on Muirhead Theorem, Y. L. Tong provided an inequality for the expectation of product of independent random variables with a majorization condition. The case where the probability measure is considered on [0, [ can be found in [27] (see p. 107). We formulate this result in the context of our work and we provide a proof motivated by the work of S. Sra in [35] which is based on a Schur's result for convex symmetric functions.

Theorem 4.2. Let f : Sn - R+ be a measurable function. Let I  R be an interval and assume that

f p()d() < 
Sn

for all p  I. Then for any m  N the map

m

F () :=

f i()d()

i=1 Sn

is Schur convex on Im. Moreover, if , х  Im are integer partitions with   х then

(4.11)

|| F ()  |х| F (х)
13

(4.12)

Proof. As F is continuous and symmetric it is sufficient to prove F is convex (cf. [27] p. 97). Now, by

Fubini's theorem we write

F () =

m
f id(i),

SnОSnОиииSn i=1

where i is the coordinates in the i-th copy of Sn. Thus, for , х  Im, the power mean inequality yields

F( + х) =

In case where , х  Im are integer partitions the condition   х is equivalent to |х| х|| (cf. [10]). Hence applying the Schur convexity of F on Im|х we obtain the following.

The following corollaries are the main results of this section. Applying the apreceding theorem to the case f () =< X,  >, whenever x  Rn+ we obtain the following generalization of Theorem 4.1 for the case of term-normalized complete homogeneous polynomials to the term-normalized -function as follows.

Corollary 4.2. Let   Rm and х  Rl. If  х then H(x)  Hх(x), x  Rn+.
Moreover, if , х are integer partitions with   х then H(x)  Hх(x), x  Rn+.
Now let x  Rn and consider the map f () = < X,  > 2 then for any p  0 we have

f p()d() < .
Sn
Notice that if  = (21, и и и , 2m) and х = (21, 22, и и и , 2l) are two integer partitions then   х if and only if   . Applying Theorem 4.2 to f () = < X,  > 2 we obtain

Corollary 4.3. Let   Rm+ and х  Rl+. If  х then

If in addition ,  are integer partitions with    then H2 (x)  H2(x), x  Rn.

(4.13)

Note that applying the above equation to the cases  = k - 1 and  = k  = (k - 1, k + 1) and  = (k, k) provides us with an entire sequence of inequalities similar to Newton's identities which is valid for all x  Rn. More precisely, we have

2k-2 H2k-2(x)  2k H2k(x), x  Rn

(4.14)

and

H2k-2(x)H2k+2(x)  H22k(x), x  Rn.

(4.15)

Finally,we conclude by noting that (4.14) provides a proof for the open problem concerning the sequence of

inequalities that was raised in [31].
