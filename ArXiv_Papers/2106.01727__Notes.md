## Abstract

In this work, a new version of KNOSOS is presented. KNOSOS is a low-collisionality radially-local, bounce-averaged neoclassical code that is extremely fast, and at the same time, includes physical effects often neglected by more standard codes: the component of the magnetic drift that is tangent to the flux-surface and the variation of the electrostatic potential on the flux-surface. An earlier version of the code could only describe configurations that were sufficiently optimized with respect to neoclassical transport. KNOSOS can now be applied to any large aspect ratio stellarator, and its performance is demonstrated by means of detailed simulations in the configuration space of Wendelstein 7-X.
