arXiv:2106.00748v1 [math.FA] 1 Jun 2021

Abstract. We study Hardy space HL1 (X) related to a self-adjoint operator L defined on Euclidean domain X  Rd. We continue study from [25], where, under certain
assumptions on the heat semigroup exp(-tL), the atomic characterization of local
type for HL1 (X) was proved. In this paper we provide additional assumptions that lead to another characteriza-
tion of HL1 (X) by the Riesz transforms related to L. As an application, we prove the Riesz transform characterization for multidimensional Bessel and Laguerre operators.

1. Introduction and statement of results

1.1. Introduction. Let Ht = exp(t) be the heat semigroup on Rd, i.e. Htf (x) = Rd Ht(x - y)f (y) dy and

(1.1)

Ht(x - y) = (4t)-d/2 exp

-|x - y|2 4t

,

x, y  Rd, t > 0.

The classical Hardy space H1(Rd) can be defined by the maximal operator related to the
operators Ht and plays an important role in harmonic analysis. We say that a function f  L1(Rd) is in H1(Rd) if and only if

f H1(Rd) := sup |Htf (·)|

< .

L1 (Rd )

There are many equivalent definitions of H1(Rd) related to various objects in harmonic analysis. The interested reader is referred to [35] and references therein. Let us recall that the Riesz transforms Rj = xj (-)-1/2, j = 1, ..., d, are given by

where x = (x1, ..., xd)  Rd. One of the classical results states that one can give equivalent definition of H1(Rd) in terms of the Riesz transforms, c.f. [20]. More precisely
a function f belongs to H1(Rd) if and only if all the functions: f, R1f, ..., Rdf belong to L1(Rd) and

On the other hand, a function f in H1(Rd) can be decomposed as an infinite linear combination of simple functions called atoms, see [12] and [26]. More precisely, for a function f  H1(Rd) we can write

(1.3)


f (x) = kak(x),
k=1

where k |k| <  and ak(x) are atoms, i.e. there exist balls Bk in Rd such that:

(1.4)

supp ak  Bk,

ak   |Bk|-1,

ak(x)dx = 0.
Bk

Here |Bk| is the Lebesgue measure of the ball Bk. For more properties of H1(Rd) we

refer the reader to [35] and references therein.

One can consider H1(Rd) as related to the classical Laplacian  on Rd, since many possible definitions of H1(Rd) are given in terms of . Since the 60's many researchers considered the Hardy spaces HL1(X) related to various self-adjoint operators L on some metric-measure spaces X, see e.g. [1,5,13,14,16,18­21,23,26,34,36]. A natural question
in this theory is the following: can we have decompositions of the type (1.3) for f  HL1(X)? Also, whether the equivalence similar to (1.2) holds or not? It appears that now we have many general results concerning atomic decompositions for HL1(X), see e.g. [18,23,32,36]. However, the characterization of HL1(X) in terms of the Riesz transforms is not know in such generality.

In the present paper we shall continue study in the context considered in [25]. Recall, that in [25] the considered space is X  Rd and a nonnegative self-adjoint operator L on L2(X) is given. The semigroup exp(-tL) satisfy upper Gaussian estimates and,
roughly speaking, the kernel Tt(x, y) of exp(-tL) is similar to Ht(x - y) for local times and Tt(x, y) decays faster for global times, where the scale of time is adjusted to some covering Q = {Qj}jN of X. For a precise statement of these assumptions see [25] or Section 1.2 below. The main issue considered in [25] was the characterization of HL1(X) in terms of the atomic decompositions. It was proved there that in this context one have atoms for HL1(X) that are either classical atoms (as in (1.4)) or atoms of the form
a(x) = |Q|-1½Q(x), Q  Q. The latter atoms are called "local atoms", c.f. [21].
Our goal here is to characterise HL1(X) by the Riesz transforms DjL-1/2, j = 1, ..., d, where Dj = xj + Vj is a derivative adapted to L. To this end we add additional assumptions for the kernels: xj Tt(x, y), Vj(x)Tt(x, y). Using this we show a result similar to (1.2), i.e. the Hardy space HL1(X) is characterized by appropriate Riesz transforms. For other results concerning this question, see e.g. [2, 5, 15, 17, 20, 22, 27, 30, 31].

Our main motivation here is to give an uniform approach that will work in different contexts and to study multidimensional cases of certain classical operators, such as Bessel and Laguerre operators. In the last and most technical section we verify that our assumptions are indeed satisfied for these two examples. One of the main ideas is that our assumptions are stated in such a way, that the multidimensional case can be deduced from the one-dimensional case.

1.2. Assumptions. In this section we state assumptions that will be used throughout the paper. Let X  Rd be a space that is a product of: finite intervals, half-lines,

RIESZ TRANSFORM CHARACTERIZATIONS FOR MULTIDIMENSIONAL HARDY SPACES 3

or lines equipped with the Lebesgue measure, i.e. X = (a1, b1) × ... × (ad, bd), where aj  [-, ) and bj  (-, ]. We shall study a non-negative self-adjoint operator L that is densely defined on L2(X). The semigroup generated by -L will be denoted
by Tt = exp(-tL) and we further assume that there exists an integral kernel Tt(x, y), such that for f  Lp(X), 1  p  , we have

Ttf (x) = Tt(x, y)f (y) dy,
X

a.e. x  X.

The Hardy space HL1(X) related to L is defined in terms of the maximal operator related to Tt, namely

HL1(X) =

f  L1(X) :

f HL1 (X) :=

sup |Ttf |

<

t>0

L1 (X )

.

The Hardy spaces HL1(X) studied in this paper will be related to some coverings Q = {Qk : k  N} of X, where Qk are cuboids. We assume that Q is an admissible
covering in the sense of Definition 2.1 below. Let dQ be the diameter of Q and denote by Q a slight enlargement of Q, see the comments after Definition 2.1 below. Following [25]

we assume that there exists   (0, 1/3) and C, c > 0, such that Tt(x, y) satisfies:

(A0)

0  Tt(x, y)  Ct-d/2 exp

(A2)

In [25] the authors studied HL1(X) for operators satisfying (A0)­(A2). It was proved that HL1(X) can be characterized by atomic decompositions with local atoms of the
form |Q|-1½Q(x), where Q  Q, see [25, Thm. A] and Theorem 2.6 below.

In the present paper we shall study the Riesz transform characterization of HL1(X), when L satisfies the following assumptions that are inspired by certain known examples

like: Bessel, Laguerre, or Schrödinger operators. On L2(X) consider the operators Rj

formally given by:

Rj = (xj + Vj )L-1/2,

j = 1, ..., d,

where xj is the standard derivative and Vj is a function that depends only on xj. Suppose that Tt(x, y) satisfy:

1.3. Results. Our first main result is the following theorem, that describes the Hardy space HL1(X) in terms of the Riesz transforms.

Theorem A. Assume that there is an operator L and an admissible covering Q as in
Sec. 1.2. In particular, we assume that (A0)­(A6) are satisfied. Then f  HL1(X) if and only if f, R1f, ..., Rdf  L1(X). Moreover, there exists a constant C > 0 such that

The proof of Theorem A is given in Section 3.1 below and it is based on known

techniques. The main idea is to compare (locally) Rj with the classical Riesz transforms Rj = xj (-)1/2 and use additional decay as t  .

One of our main motivations is to study product cases. Assume that for i = 1, ..., N

we have operators Li satisfying the assumptions of Section 1.2. In particular, Li is associated with the semigroup Tt[i] that has a kernel Tt[i](xi, yi), xi, yi  Xi. Then we can define

and

(1.8)

L = L1 + ... + LN ,

such that each Li acts only on the variable xi  Xi. For more precise description see Section 2.2 below. The following theorem gives the Riesz transform characterization for HL1(X) in the product case.

Theorem B. Let X and L be as in (1.7)­(1.8) and assume that for each i = 1, ..., N the semigroup kernel Tt[i](xi, yi) together with an admissible covering Qi of Xi satisfy the conditions (A0)­(A6). Then f  HL1(X) if and only if f, R1f, ..., Rdf  L1(Rd).
Moreover,

The proof of Theorem B is given in Section 3.2 below. We shall use [25, Thm. B],
where we proved that assuming (A0)­(A2) for Tt[i](xi, yi) and Qi we can define an admissible covering Q1 ...QN that describes HL1(X) for L = L1 +...+LN , see [25, Def. 1.5].

RIESZ TRANSFORM CHARACTERIZATIONS FOR MULTIDIMENSIONAL HARDY SPACES 5

As an example of applications of Theorem B we study certain multidimensional Bessel and Laguerre operators. Thanks to Theorem B it is enough to verify (A0)­(A6) only in the one-dimensional case. Then, the Riesz transform characterization for HL1(X) for the multidimensional case (when L is the sum of Bessel or Laguerre operators) follows from Theorem B. Below we briefly recall the operators that we work with and state the results.

More precisely, by L[B] we shall denote a proper self-adjoint operator defined on L2(X), see e.g. [11]. Harmonic analysis related to L[B] was studied in e.g. [4­7, 9, 11]. In [5] the authors describe the Hardy space related to L[B] for d = 1 in terms of either atomic decompositions or Riesz transforms

QB = [2n, 2n+1] : n  Z .

Then QB is an admissible covering for (0, ) and for d > 1 we have the admissible coverings QB  ...  QB defined in [25, Def. 1.5]. The following theorem follows directly from [25, Prop. 4.3], Theorem B and Proposition 4.5 below.

see (1.9).

Set X = (0, )d. By L[L] we shall denote a known self-adjoint operator on L2(X), see e.g. [29] . In [2, 3, 8, 28, 29] we find some studies on harmonic analysis related to L[L]. In particular the authors of [2] proves the atomic decomposition theorem for the Hardy space related to L[L] in the one-dimensional case. For d = 1 we have the following admissible covering of (0, ),

(1.12)

QL = [2n + (k - 1)2-n, 2n + k2-n] : k = 1, . . . , 22n; n  N  [2-n, 2-n+1] : n  N+ .

and, using this covering, we produce QL  ...  QL for d > 1, see [25, Def. 1.5]. Com-

bining [25, Prop. 4.5], Prop. 4.11 below, and Theorem B we arrive at the following

Organization of the paper. In Section 2 we recall some known facts and prove preliminary estimates. Section 3 is devoted to proving Theorems A and B. Propositions 4.5 and 4.11, that are crucial for Theorems C and D, are stated and proved in Section 4. We shall use a standard convention that C and c at each occurrence denote some positive constants independent of relevant quantities (depending on the context). We will write A B for A  CB and A  B for A B A.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Admissible coverings. Let X  Rd be as in Sec. 1.2. For z = (z1, ..., zd)  X and r1, ..., rd > 0 we denote the closed cuboid
Q(z, r1, ..., rd) = {x  X : |xi - zi|  ri for i = 1, ..., d} ,
and the cube Q(z, r) = Q(z, r, ..., r). The following definition will be used throughout the paper, c.f. [25, Def. 1.2].
Definition 2.1. Let Q be a set of cuboids in X  Rd. We call Q an admissible covering if:
1. X = QQ Q, 2. if Q1, Q2  Q and Q1 = Q2, then |Q1  Q2| = 0, 3. if Q = Q(z, r1, ..., rd)  Q, then ri  rj for i, j  {1, ..., d}, 4. if Q1, Q2  Q and Q1  Q2 = , then dQ1  dQ2, 5. if Q  Q, then distRd(Q, Rd \ X) dQ.

Having an admissible covering Q and Q = (z, r1, ..., rd)  Q, we define Q := Q(z, r1, ..., rd),

where  > 1 is chosen so that for Q1, Q2  Q,

(2.2)

Q1  Q2 =  

Q1  Q2 = 

and

(2.3)

distRd (Q, Rd \ X) > 0.

RIESZ TRANSFORM CHARACTERIZATIONS FOR MULTIDIMENSIONAL HARDY SPACES 7

The family {Q}QQ is a finite covering of X, namely

(2.4)

½Q(x)  C,

x  X.

QQ

Let us notice that we have a flexibility in choosing the enlargements Q, Q, Q etc.

In particular the notation in [25] is slightly different. Recall that having admissible

coverings Qi of Xi, i = 1, ..., N , we can produce a natural admissible covering Q1  ...  QN of X as in (1.7), see [25, Def. 1.5].

2.2. Products. In this subsection i will be always an index from {1, ..., N}. Let Xi  Rdi and Li are as in Sec. 1.2 on L2(Rdi). Set d = d1 + ... + dN and let X be as (1.7). Now, we shall explain the precise meaning of (1.8). Slightly abusing the notation we
keep the symbol Li for the operator

I  ...  I Li  I  ...  I

i-1 times

N -i times

on L2(X), where I denotes the identity operator on the corresponding subspace, and

we define

Lf (x) = L1f (x) + . . . + LN f (x), x = (x1, . . . , xN )  X.

Since the operators Li are self-adjoint, the operator L is well defined and essentially self-adjoint, see e.g. [33, Thm. 7.23].
Recall that the semigroups Tt[i] = exp (-tLi) on Xi have the kernels Tt[i](xi, yi), xi, yi  Xi, t > 0, so that the semigroup Tt = exp(-tL) is related to the kernel
Tt(x, y) = Tt[1](x1, y1) · ... · Tt[N](xN , yN ).

2.3. Local atomic Hardy spaces. For an admissible covering Q of X  Rd (see Definition 2.1) we shall define the local atomic Hardy space Ha1t(Q) related to Q as follows.
Definition 2.5. A function a : X  C is called a Q - atom if either:
(i) there is Q  Q and a cube K  Q, such that:

supp a  K, a   |K|-1, a(x) dx = 0; or
(ii) there exists Q  Q such that
a(x) = |Q|-1½Q(x).

Then, the atomic space Ha1t(Q), is defined in a standard way. Namely, we say that a function f is in Ha1t(Q) if f (x) = k kak(x) with Q-atoms ak and k |k| < . Moreover, the norm of Ha1t(Q) is given by

f Ha1t(Q) = inf

|k| ,

k

where the infimum is taken over all possible representations of f (x) = k kak(x) as above. A standard argument shows that Ha1t(Q) is a Banach subspace of L1(X).

Here we state the atomic decomposition result that follows from [25, Thm. A]. This will be needed later in the proof of Theorem A.

Theorem 2.6. Assume that for L, Tt, and an admissible covering Q the assumptions (A0)­(A2) are satisfied. Then HL1(X) = Ha1t(Q) and the corresponding norms are equivalent.

2.4. Classical local Hardy spaces. In this section we recall briefly some theory related to the classical local Hardy spaces on Rd, c.f. [21, 35]. In particular, we shall present the relation between classical local Hardy spaces and local Riesz transforms in Proposition 2.7.

Recall that the kernel of the Riesz transform Rj = xj (-)-1/2 can be given by

Rj(x, y) = -1/2

 0

xj

Ht(x

-

y)

and

for

denote

Rj,loc(x, y) = -1/2

xj

Ht(x

-

y)

dt t

,

Rj,glob(x, y) = -1/2

xj

Ht(x

-

dt t

.

It is well known that these kernels are related (in the principal value sense) with the operators Rj,loc and Rj,glob that are well-defined and bounded on L2(Rd) (uniformly in  > 0). In what follows we shall need the following version of the characterization of
local Hardy spaces.

Proposition 2.7. There exists C > 0 that does not depend on  > 0 such that:

1. If a(x) is either a classical atom or local atom of the form a(x) = |Q|-1½Q(x),
where Q = Q(z, r1, ..., rd), r1  ...  rd   , we have

d
a + L1(Rd)
j=1

Rj ,loc a

 C1,
L1 (Rd )

where C1 does not depend on  . 2. Assume that suppf  Q, where Q = Q(z, r1, ..., rd), r1  ...  rd   , and

M :=

d
f + L1(Q)
j=1

Rj ,loc f

< .
L1 (Q )

Then there exist sequences {k}k and {ak(x)}k, such that f (x) = k kak(x), k |k|  C2M, and ak are either the classical atoms supported in a cube
K  Q or ak(x) = |Q|-1½Q(x). Moreover, C2 is independent on  .

Sketch of the proof. This fact is well known and has quite standard proof. For the convenience of the reader we provide a sketch of the proof. Notice that

Rj,loc(x,

y)

=

cd

xj - yj |x - y|d+1



|x - y| 

,

where  is smooth on [0, ), (0) = cd and (s)  e-s2 as s  .
Part 1. follows by standard Calderón-Zygmund argument. The main idea is to use the L2-estimate on Q(x0, 2 ) and the estimate Rj,loc(x, y)   |x-y|-d-1 for y  Q(x0,  ) and x  Q(x0, 2 ).

RIESZ TRANSFORM CHARACTERIZATIONS FOR MULTIDIMENSIONAL HARDY SPACES 9
In order to prove 2. define 0 = f and let

g(x) = f (x) - 0|Q|-1½Q(x).

Then a0(x) = |Q|-1½Q(x) is one of our atoms, |0|  M, supp g  Q and g = 0. By
standard computations one may check that

Using the classical characterization of H1(Rd) by means of the Riesz transforms, see (1.2), we obtain

g(x) = kak(x),
k=1

where ak(x) are classical atoms on Rd and


|k| M.
k=1

Then


f (x) = kak(x),
k=0


|k| M.
k=0

This may look that we are done, but notice that we also want to have atoms ak supported in Q (not anywhere in Rd). This can be done by a standard procedure, for details
see e.g. [24, Thm. 2.2(b)]. Let us notice, that here we make use of point 5. from Definition 2.1, i.e. we enlarge Q in Rd, but we want to have atoms supported in Q
that is still in X.

2.5. Partition of unity. In what follows we shall decompose functions using an admissible covering Q of X  Rd. Using Definition 2.1 one can find functions Q  C1(X) such that:

(2.8)

0  Q(x)  ½Q(x),

Q   Cd-Q1,

Q(x) = ½X (x).

QQ

The family {Q}QQ will be called a partition of unity related to Q.

2.6. Auxiliary estimates. In what follows we shall use a slight generalization of (A2)­ (A5) that follows easily from (A0) and (A2)­(A5). Here we state these estimates for further references.

2.7. Riesz transforms. For  > 0 and j = 1, ...d we split the kernel (1.5) as Rj(x, y) = Rj,loc(x, y) + Rj,glob(x, y) + RVj (x, y), where

First inequality: f HL1,Riesz(X)

f . HL1 (X) We shall show that

(3.1)

Rj a L1(X)  C

for j = 1, 2, ..., d and a Q-atom a(x) with C independent of a. In general, (3.1) may not

be enough to prove boundedness of an operator on H1, see [10]. However, here Theorem

2.6, (3.1), and a standard continuity argument imply f HL1,Riesz(X)

f . HL1 (X) To

show (3.1), according to Definition 2.5, suppose that a(x) is an Q-atom associated with

Q  Q. Let RdjQ,loc, RdjQ,glob and RVj denote the operators with the integral kernels defined in (2.10). Applying (A6), (A4), (A3), (A5), and part 1. of Proposition 2.7 we

and (3.1) is proved. Let us notice here that since a is bounded and supp a  Q then our assumptions guarantee that all the operators appearing above are well-defined.

Second inequality: f HL1 (X)

f . HL1,Riesz(X) Assume that f < . HL1,Riesz(X)

According to Theorem 2.6 it is enough to decompose f as k kak(x) with Q-atoms

ak(x) and k |k|  f . HL1,Riesz(X) Let Q be a partition of unity related to Q, see

Section 2.5. We have f (x) = QQ fQ(x), with fQ(x) = Q(x)f (x) and supp fQ  Q.

Notice that

RdjQ,locfQ = RdjQ,loc - RdjQ,loc fQ + (Rj fQ - QRjf ) - RdjQ,globfQ - RVj fQ + QRj f.

3.2. Proof of Theorem B.
Proof. The plan of the proof is as follows. According to Theorem A it is enough to prove (A0)­(A6) for the kernel
Tt(x, y) = Tt[1](x1, y1) · ... · Tt[N](xN , yN )
with the covering Q1  ...  QN , see [25, Def. 1.5]. It is enough to consider N = 2 and then use an inductive argument. Assume that the conditions (A0)­(A6) are satisfied for Tt[1](x1, y1) and Tt[2](x1, y1) with Q1 and Q2, respectively. The estimate (A0) for Tt(x, y) follows directly. Moreover, (A1)­(A2) were already proved in the proof of [25, Thm. B].
To deal with (A3)­(A6) denote
Ü = (x1, ..., xd1, xd1+1, ..., xd1+d2) = (Ü1, Ü2)  X1 × X2  Rd1 × Rd2.
Recall that a cuboid in Q1  Q2 is of the form K = K1 × K2, where Kj  Qj  Qj, j = 1, 2, and dK  dK1  dK2  min(dQ1, dQ2), see [25, Def. 1.5]. For the rest of the

RIESZ TRANSFORM CHARACTERIZATIONS FOR MULTIDIMENSIONAL HARDY SPACES 13

proof we fix y  K = K1 × K2  Q1 × Q2 and without loss of generality we consider xj for j  {d1 + 1, ..., d1 + d2}.
Proof of (A3). Notice that (K)c = (K1 × K2)c = S1  S2  S3, where

S1 = X1 × (Q2)c, S2 = X1 × (Q2 \ K2), S3 = (K1)c × K2.

The goal of this section is to prove Theorems C and D. According to Theorem B it is enough to prove (A0)­(A6) for the one-dimensional Bessel operator L[B] and the one-dimensional Laguerre operator L[L].

Recall that (A0)­(A2) were proved in [25, Prop. 4.3 and 4.5], so we shall deal only

with (A3)­(A6) in Propositions 4.5 and 4.11. We shall write Tt(x, y) for the Bessel and

Laguerre semigroups in Sec.

4.1 and 4.2, respectively.

for x  0, for x  , for x > 0,

see e.g. [37]. The main goal of this section is to prove the following proposition.

Proposition 4.5. Let X = (0, ) and  > 0. Then (A3)­ (A6) hold for L[B] with QB, see (1.10).

Before going to the proof let us make some preparations. In what follows we shall

Now we are almost ready to prove Proposition 4.11 but first let us make a few comments and fix some notion. The proof relies on a detailed and lengthy analysis, but essentially one uses only simple calculus and properties of I-1/2. We shall write a  b = min(a, b) and a  b = max(a, b). Recall that QL is the set of intervals given in (1.12). The proof will be given in two cases. First we shall deal with the sub-intervals of [0, 1] in Section 4.2.1. Then we shall consider sub-intervals of [1, ) in Section 4.2.2. The letter n will always be a positive integer. Moreover, we shall use N as a constant that is fixed and large enough, depending on the context (most often we shall use the inequality exp(-x) x-N ).

4.2.1. Case 1: I  [0, 1]. We consider I = [2-n, 2-n+1], n  N, and y  I. Then y  2-n = dI . Fix 2-1 < 1 < 1 < 2 < 2 such that I = [12-n, 22-n+1].
