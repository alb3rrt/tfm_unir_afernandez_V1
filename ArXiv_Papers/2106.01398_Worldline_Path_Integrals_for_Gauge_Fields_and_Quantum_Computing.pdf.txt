Yuan Feng(1), Michael McGuigan (2) (1) Pasadena City College, (2) Brookhaven National Laboratory
Abstract We study different aspects the worldline path integrals with gauge fields using quantum computing. We use the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Evolution of Hamiltonian (EOH) quantum algorithms and IBM QISKit to perform our computations. We apply these methods to the path integral of a particle moving in a Abelian and non-Abelian background gauge field associated with a constant magnetic field and the field of a chromo-magnetic field. In all cases we found excellent agreement with the classical computation. We also discuss the insertion of vertex operators into the worldline path integrals to study scattering and show how to represent them using unitary operators and quantum gates on near term quantum computers.

1 Introduction
Recently there has been a great deal of interest in the quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge fields. Most of these studies are restricted to lower dimensions because of the large amount of qubits and large depth quantum circuits that are involved in performing a quantum field simulation. In this paper we explore quantum simulation of gauge fields using the worldline formalism. We study the quantum simulation of a particle moving in a constant magnetic field in both Cartesian and polar coordinates. We also study the world line Hamiltonian for a non-Abelian gauge field and discuss the use of vertex operators for the quantum simulation of nonlinear theories. We use the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) quantum algorithm and Evolution of Hamiltonian (EOH) quantum algorithm to obtain our results and obtain excellent agreement with classical computations.

2 Quantum computer simulation for a constant magnetic field

One example of a worldline path integral in particle propagation in a constant electro-

magnetic field. For a constant magnetic field the non-relativistic Lagrangian is given by

[1][2][3]:

L = m (x 2 + y2 + z2) + eB (xy - x y)

(2.1)

Where B is the magnitude of the magnetic field in the z direction. This is written in terms

of the vector potential as:

2.1 Quantum computation with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver

The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid classical quantum algorithm that

can be run on near term quantum hardware because the circuit depth can be kept small for

the algorithm, at least for simple variational wave forms [4]. Like the traditional variational

method one optimizes

E0(i) =

(i)| H |(i) (i)| (i)

(2.15)

with variational parameters i to obtain an upper bound on the value of the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian. One uses an optimizer to determine the minimum of the energy

expectation value and the expectation value is evaluated on the quantum computer. QISKit

provides several optimizers. In this paper we use the The the statevector simulator with the

Sequential Least SQuares Programming (SLSQP) optimizer. For the VQE the variational

wave functions are represented as unitary matrices acting on qubits through quantum gates

and the the parameters are rotation angles associated with these gates.

The Hamiltonian were mapped to 8qubit operators for Cartesian coordinates and 4-qubit operators for Polar coordinates. The quantum circuit for each simulation utilized an Ry variational form, with a fully entangled circuit of depth 3. The backend used was a statevector simulator. The Sequential Least SQuares Programming (SLSQP) optimizer was used, with a maximum of 600 iterations.

figure 1 and table 2 and are in excellent agreement with the classical computations. This is possible because of the similarity of the particle in a constant magnetic field and the two dimensional harmonic oscillator for which the variational forms in QISKit has a strong overlap with the ground state wave function.

2.2 Quantum computation with the Evolution of Hamiltonian algorithm.

A second quantum algorithm we applied to worldline path integrals of gauge fields is

the Evolution of Hamiltonian algorithm. The Evolution of Hamiltonian (EOH) algorithm

evaluates

K(Xi, Xf ; T ) = (Xf )| e-itH |(Xi)

(2.21)

the transition amplitude between an initial state and a final state with H the Hamiltonian and t the time of the evolution and is depicted in figure 2. When applying the EOH algorithm it is convenient to use the position basis in which the position operator is diagonal instead of the oscillator basis described above. In the position basis the momentum matrix is dense and constructed from the position operator using a Sylvester matrix F . In the

position basis the position matrix is:

2 (Qpos)j,k = 4N (2j - (N + 1))j,k

(2.22)

and the momentum matrix is:

Ppos = F QposF

(2.23)

where

1 Fj,k = 

e

2i 4N

(2j-(N

+1))(2k-(N

(2.24)

Then the position and momentum operators are defined similarly to the above in terms of tensor products with Q replaced by Qpos and P replaced by Ppos. The results of the EOH computation using the Trotter-Suzuki approximation in QISKit of the particle in a constant magnetic field are show in figure 3. The multiple curves in the graphs indicate the various transition probabilities from initial position (xi, yi) = (0, 0) to a final position (xf , yf ) and are in excellent agreement with the classical results obtained by directly exponentiating the Hamiltonian matrix.

3 Quantum computer simulation for a non-Abelian gauge field
The quantum computer simulation of a particle in a background non-Abelian gauge field is more complicated than the quantum simulation of a particle in an Abelian gauge field discussed above. This is because the part of the Lagrangian involving the non-Abelian gauge field has to be path ordered for gauge invariance and this is difficult to implement directly. Instead one introduces worldline fermions into the 0+1 dimensional path integral associated with the non-Abelian symmetry group to implement the path ordering [5][6][7][8]

7

[9] [10] [11] [12] [13]. Then one can treat the systems as a more traditional Lagrangian system and can implement quantum simulation more straightforwardly. The Lagrangian of a particle moving in a non-Abelian gauge field then is given by

L

=

1 x i2 2

+ a a

+

fabcAai (x)x ibc

(3.1)

where a are world line fermion fields which take into account the path ordering and fabc are the structure constant of the Lie group. The Hamiltonian is then:

1 H=
2

pi + fabcAai (x)bc

2

(3.2)

In a background field expansion about a reference point x0 and a background field expansion using normal coordinates the Hamiltonian can be written in terms of the field strength as:

1 H=
2

pi + fabcFiaj (x0)xj bc

2

(3.3)

a form similar to the Abelian case discussed above. To proceed further one needs a solution to the non-Abelian backgorund gauge field
equations of motion or the Yang-Mills equation [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]. For the non-Abelian SU (2) gauge field an ansatz used for the Wu-Yang is given by:

Aai (x)

=

iab

xb r2

f (r)

defining g = f - 1 the equations of motion reduce to:

g

=

g r2

(g2

-

1)

which for small r has the expansion

(3.4) (3.5)

g  1 - r2 + 3 r4 + . . . 10

(3.6)

and large r we have:

1 31 g  1 - r + 4 r2 + . . .

(3.7)

These expressions can be used to study the quantum simulation of a particle in a back-

ground non-Abelian gauge field but other forms can be studied as well depending on the

application.

3.1 Quantum computation with the VQE for Hamiltonian for a nonAbelian gauge field

To map the the Hamiltonian for a particle moving in a non-Abelian gauge field in terms of qubits we use P and Q from (2.17) and (2.18) with N = 4 and form the tensor products:

x = Q  I4  I4  I8 y = I4  Q  I4  I8 z = I4  I4  Q  I8 px = P  I4  I4  I8 py = I4  P  I4  I8 pz = I4  I4  P  I8

(3.8)

For SU (2) we have three worldline fermions which are represented by

1 = I64 

01 00

 I2  I2

2 = I64  I2 

01 00

 I2

3 = I64  I2  I2

For the quantum computation for non-Abelian gauge field we use the Hamilton

where

.

For three bosons xi represented as 4 О 4 so six qubits are used to represent the bosons

and for three fermions i we use three qubits. The full Hamiltonian for a particle moving

in an SU (2) gauge field uses nine qubits and is represented by a 512 О 512 matrix. The

results using the VQE algorithm and the SLSQP optimizer are shown in figure 4 and table

2. The results are not as accurate as for the Abelian gauge field. One possible reason is

that the variational form used in the optimization is parametrized by angles associated

with quantum gates does not overlap as strongly with the ground state for non-Abelian

backgrounds as it does in the Abelian case.

4 Vertex operators and quantum simulation associated with non-linear field equations
One difficulty with quantum simulation is the the quantum circuits represent linear operators as a series of Unitary gates. This works well in simulating linear equations like the Schrodinger equation. However nonlinear equations are also important in physics such

as the Yang-Mills equation. To represent the nonlinear aspects of of these equations on a quantum computer one can use Vertex operators which are unitary operators and can be realized in terms of gates. This modifies the the Evolution of Hamiltonian algorithm by considering worldine actions on a graph which splits at a vertex at which point the vertex operator is inserted. This method allows the calculation of scattering amplitudes using the worldline formalism and requires far fewer qubits that a full quantum field theory simulation on a quantum computer.
For example for the SU (2) Yang-Mills one needs to add an additional x field in the world line action corresponding to the rank of the group and two vertex operators V1 and V2 associated with the roots of the Lie algebra of which there are two. For SU (3) the rank is two so we add two additional x fields and six vertex operators Vi for i = 1, 2, . . . , 6.

4.1 Nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation
As a simple example consider the case of the non-linear Klein-Gordon equation [19]. The nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation with interacting potential V () is:

t2 - 2 + m2 + V () = 0

(4.1)

For a quartic interaction potential this equation has a solution in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions.

where m is the mass of the Klein-Gordon field. The Hamiltonian associated with this world

line action is:

(4.3)

For 3 potential scattering amplitudes can be determined by inserting factors

(4.4)

into the world line path integral where pk denotes the energy-momentum of kth particle.

4.2 Nonlinear Euler-Heisenberg equation
Another system of nonlinear equations that can be realized on a quantum computer using this method is the Non-linear Euler-Heisenberg equation [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28]. In the weak field limit the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian density is given by:

4.3 Quantum computation with Vertex operators
One can use quantum computation with vertex operators. First construct a circuit from a EOH for a free particle for time 1 - followed by a Unitary insertion of a Vertex operator for a time  - to  + and then finally we have a EOH from  + tp T . Schematically we have K(0,  - )V ( - ,  + )K( + , T ) as described in figure 5. One can also add more insertions of N vertex operators to model scattering of two scalar particles with a nonlinear 3 interaction [29] [30] [31] [32]. For a three scalar particle amplitude given by:

A(p1, p2, p3) = p1| V^op(p2) |p3 = gn (p2 - (p3 - p1))

one can insert the unitary vertex operator

(4.13)

into a quantum circuit and representing in the initial momentum states in terms of qubits we find the results in figure 6. Note the peak in p2 as a function of the initial and final momentum difference which represents a discrete approximation to the Dirac delta function. Four qubits were used in this computation so we have sixteen possible initial momentum states in the discretization. The results of the quantum computation using the TrotterSuzuki approximation for the insertion of the unitary vertex operator, where the evolution parameter was taken to be p2. The insertion of the vertex operator leads to a g3 interaction potential in the effective action for  and a quadratic term in its non-linear Klein-Gordon equation of motion.

5 Conclusions
In this paper we applied the VQE and EOH quantum algorithms on an IBM quantum simulator to the problem of simulating particle propagation in an magnetic field. We compared the simulation in both Cartesian and polar coordinates. We also discussed the

13

quantum simulation of a particle in a chromo-magnetic field governed by the the nonlinear Yang-Mills equation. Finally we gave example of the use of vertex operators on quantum computers to simulate the scattering in various non-linear theories and gave examples in the case of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation. The world line approach has several advantages over for quantum field simulation including the use of fewer qubits and being able to do simulations in 3+1 dimensions. It will interesting to explore worldline path integrals on near term quantum computers. The quantum simulation of particles in background gauge fields also has applications to Kaluza-Klein theory and quantum gravity [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] which will also be interesting to examine through quantum computing.
