Abstract. The variety Singn,m consists of all tuples X = (X1, . . . , Xm) of n×n matrices such that every linear combination of X1, . . . , Xm is singular. Equivalently, X  Singn,m if and only if det(1X1 +. . .+mXm) = 0 for all 1, . . . , m  Q. Makam and Wigderson [12] asked whether the ideal generated by these equations is always radical, that is, if any polynomial identity that is valid on Singn,m lies in the ideal generated by the polynomials det(1X1 + . . . + mXm). We answer this question in the negative by determining the vanishing ideal of Sing2,m for all m  N. Our results exhibit that there are additional equations arising from the tensor structure of X. More generally, for any n and m  n2 - n + 1, we prove there are equations vanishing on Singn,m that are not in the ideal generated by polynomials of type det(1X1 + . . . + mXm). Our methods are based on classical results about Fano schemes, representation theory and Gr¨obner bases.

1. Introduction

1.A. Motivation. In the late 70's, Valiant [11] proposed an algebraic analogue of the in-

famous P vs NP question, using a computational model distinct from Turing machines, the

model of arithmetic circuits. The model of arithmetic circuits captures the natural ways

to compute a polynomial function from the basic arithmetic operations, addition and mul-

tiplication, via a directed graph encoding how the arithmetic operations are to be nested.

Considering such circuits exhibits in many cases non-obvious ways to compute a polynomial

that can be much more efficient compared to naively plugging in values into an expanded

form. However, since circuits overparameterize polynomials, the problem of polynomial

identity testing (PIT), i.e. whether two circuits define the same polynomial, arises natu-

rally. A special case of (PIT) is Determinant Identity Testing (DIT), where a polynomial pA in variables x1, . . . , xm, m  N is given by a tuple of matrices A = (A1, . . . , Am)  (Qn×n)m
and the formula
m

pA = det( xiAi).

i=1

While computing the determinant of a fixed rational matrix is easy, there is no known efficient

deterministic algorithm to even check if an expression such as det(

m i=1

xiAi)

evaluates

to

the constant zero polynomial. This is curious, since an efficient probabilistic algorithm is to

simply evaluate such a linear matrix expression in a few random points (which is essentially

a consequence of the Schwartz-Zippel lemma [10], [13]). Finding such an algorithm would

have a major impact towards resolving Valiant's analogue of the P vs NP question [6]. For

a detailed introduction to Valiant's classes and circuit complexity, we refer to [9].

1.B. Algebraic View and Contributions. Determinant identity testing is the problem
to decide membership in the algebraic variety Singn,m, i.e. given a matrix tuple A = (A1, . . . , Am), determine whether all linear combinations of the Ai are singular. The algebraization of the (DIT) problem was driven e.g. by Makam and Wigderson [12], who
argued that understanding the geometric structure of the variety Singn,m might be a stepping stone on a long climb towards resolving VP vs VNP. In this work, we will answer the
question of radicality Makam and Wigderson posed in [12, Problem 12.6], [7, Problem 4.6]:

all generators of the vanishing ideal of Singn,m?1 While these equations set-theoretically describe the variety Singn,m and while, from a (DIT)-oriented perspective, they form the most natural set of elements in the ideal of Singn,m, it turns out that the ideal generated by these polynomials is in general not radical. In fact, looking at the problem from the

perspective of 3-tensors makes other identities apparent from rank constraints on different

flattenings. Our main theorem is the following.

Theorem 1.1. The ideal of the variety Sing2,m is generated by quadratic polynomials

if and only if m  2. For m  3 this ideal is generated by quadrics and cubics.

For any n, the ideal of the variety Singn,m is not generated by the polynomials

if m > n2 - n.

1.C. Related work. By a celebrated result of Kabanets and Impagliazzo [6], a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for (DIT) would show that either NEXP  P/poly or the permanent is not computable by polynomially-sized arithmetic circuits. Since the permanent is complete for VNP [9], this would give evidence to a separation of the Valiant classes VP and VNP. The Kabanets-Impagliazzo result is conceptually remarkable in the sense that constructing an algorithm for (DIT) would indicate hardness of some family in VNP. It has thus motivated extensive studies on the algebraic properties of (DIT).
Perhaps surprisingly, the case of non-commuting variables turned out easier. A line of work (e.g. [1], [5]) showed the existence of a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for the non-commutative analogue of (DIT). Besides the derandomization of (DIT), other approaches for the resolution of VP vs VNP have been studied, recently e.g. via sparsity of families of Sum-of-Squares representations [3]. Our methods are based on the fundamental article by Chan and Ilten [2].

2. Preliminaries and general notation

In what follows, we identify n × n matrices with elements of the tensor product Cn  Cn.

Further, we identify m-tuples A = (A1, . . . , Am) of n × n-matrices with 3-tensors, that is,

elements

Let

be the set of all singular matrix tuples, i.e. all elements such that the image of the corresponding map Cm  Cn  Cn only contains matrices of rank at most n - 1. We

write In,m or I(Singn,m) for the vanishing ideal of Singn,m in the polynomial ring in matrices X(1), . . . , X(m) of algebraically independent indeterminates (x(ijk))i,j{1,...,n}, where k  {1, . . . , m}.

1Here, X(1), . . . , X(m) denote matrices of algebraically independent variables.

The variety Singn,m comes with a natural group action of the group GLm × GLn × GLn, which we will call G := Gn,m throughout the paper. G acts on 3-tensors by "left-rightback" multiplication, i.e. in the language of matrix tuples, if (U, V, W )  G and A = (A1, . . . , Am)  Singn,m, then
(U, V, W )A = (V A1W, . . . , V AmW )U
Clearly, the determinant of a fixed matrix can only change by a nonzero scalar under left-right multiplication with an element of GLn × GLn. On the other hand, linear transformations on the Cm-mode just correspond to taking different linear combinations, whence Singn,m is invariant under the action of G. We will assume that the reader is familiar with basic representation theory, in particular heighest weight vectors for the general linear group. For a brief introduction we refer to [8, Chapter 10] and for a detailed one to [4].

2.A. Ideal generation and multiplication maps. When studying ideal generation via
the means of invariant theory, it is crucial to understand what happens if we take the tensor product of irreducible representations: It turns out that the polynomials of degree d+d  N0 generated by the degree-d part of some ideal I are the image of a sum of tensor products of
explicit modules. For m  N0, tensor products of irreducible GLm-modules are understood by the Littlewood-Richardson rule.
Let I a homogeneous ideal of a standard graded ring R (e.g. a polynomial ring graded by the total degree). For d, d  N0, we denote by Rd (resp: Id) the degree-d component of R (resp: I). Furthermore, assume that a group H acts on Rd and Id for any d, thus turning both I and R into H-modules. Then the multiplication map

Id × Rd  Id+d , (p, r)  r · p

induces the following map of H-representations

MI,d,d : Id  Rd  Id+d .

The image of MI,d,d are those elements in the ideal that are of degree d + d and lie in the ideal generated by all elements of I of degree at most d (equivalently: of degree precisely d). In the case R = C[X(1), . . . , X(m)] and I = In,m we will write Mm,d,d instead of MI,d,d and suppress the dependency on n.
Now, there are finite collections V, W of irreducible modules such that Id and Rd split into sums

Id = V

V V
and

Rd =

W.

W W

The image of MI,d,d is then spanned by the images of the modules V  W , where (V, W )  V × W. In particular, assume I = In,m with GLm acting on it. Then by the representation theory of the general linear group, the image of MI,d,d is spanned by the images of modules isomorphic to
S(Cm)  Sµ(Cm)

where   d and µ  d. In this case, the Littlewood-Richardson rule describes how such a product of representation decomposes as a sum (cf. [4, Appendix A.1]).

3. The case of 2 × 2 matrices
In this section we restrict our attention to the case n = 2. We determine generators, and in fact the whole Gr¨obner basis of the vanishing ideal I(Sing2,m). Our main idea is based on the proof of [8, Theorem 5.8].
For k  {1, . . . , m}, let Xk = (x(ijk)) be matrices with distinct indeterminate entries. Let I = I(Sing2,m)  C[x(ijk)] be the homogeneous vanishing ideal of X. By [12, Proposition

4

5.1], the degree one component I1 is 0, and the degree two component is spanned by the

forms

C.

Let J be the ideal generated by I2. Then the following holds. 

Theorem 3.1. If m  3 then the ideal J is not radical. The ideal I = J is generated by

I2 and all 3 × 3 minors of the linear map Cm  C2  C2.

Proof. We show this by constructing a Gr¨obner basis of an ideal I~ that contains J and is

contained in I. As the leading monomials are all square-free with respect to the degrevlexorder, the ideal I~ must be radical. Thus I~ = I.

In degree two we consider the forms

(3.1)

det(Xi + Xj) - det Xi - det Xj i, j.

In degree three, for every i, j, k we consider all 3 × 3 minors of the matrix

and consider the following m × 2 submatrices T12, T13, T24, T34 where Tij contains the i-th and the j-th column of T .

Let G12, G13, G24, G34 be the sets containing the 2 × 2 minors of the corresponding ma-

trices. Consider the products G12G24, G13G34. A Gr¨obner basis G for I~ will be given by all equations in eq. (3.1), all 3 × 3 minors as

above and all elements of the sets G12G24, G13G34. That all these forms are contained in I

is proved in Lemma 3.2.

We prove the theorem relying on a computer algebra system as follows. To prove that G

is a Gr¨obner basis, by Buchberger's criterion, we need to show that all S-pairs reduce to 0.

Let f, g  G. By construction f and g each contain the variables of at most four matrices.

If f and g both contain variables of four different matrices such that combined there appear

variables of eight matrices, then by construction, the variables of f and of g are disjoint. It

follows that the S-pair of f and g reduces to 0, by Buchberger's second criterion. If this

is not the case, then f and g contain the variables of at most seven different matrices. It

therefore suffices to show the statement for m = 2, . . . , 7. We verify this using a computer.

Hence, G is a Gr¨obner basis.

Every form of degree two or three in this Gr¨obner basis contains only monomials that

are square-free. For forms in G12G24 and G13G34 this is not true. However, the leading monomial is still square-free. In particular, the leading ideal of I~ is radical, and so is I~. Thus I~ = I and G is in fact a Gr¨obner basis of I. We note that the degree four elements of

the Gr¨obner basis are generated by quadrics and cubics (which may be checked e.g. using a

computer).

Lemma 3.2. All forms in G are contained in I.

Proof. This is clear for the forms in eq. (3.1). Modulo J, the 3 × 3 minors we have in G are the same as the 3 × 3 minors of the map Cm  C2  C2. This can be explicitly written down as there are only three different matrices involved.
It thus suffices to show that the map Cm  C2  C2 has rank at most 2. We consider the corresponding map between projective spaces
PCm  P(C2  C2).
By assumption the image is contained in the set of rank one matrices which is P1 × P1. This variety only contains three types of subspaces: For every v, w  P1 the spaces v × P1, P1 × w

IDEALS OF SPACES OF DEGENERATE MATRICES

5

and v × w are contained. There are no subspaces of (projective) dimension two contained in P1 × P1. Hence the image of Cm  C2  C2 has dimension at most two.
Lastly, we need to check the elements of G12G24, G13G34. Let A  X be an m-tuple of matrices, then the image of the map above has only two possibilities. Either the columns of all matrices in A span a one-dimensional space, or the rows span a one-dimensional space
(or both). Hence, either every form in G12 vanishes or every form in G24 vanishes, and the same holds for G13 and G34.

4. There are (essentially) no new equations for m > n2

For m > n2, expressions of the kind

m i=1

(

become

overparameterized

due to the dimension of the matrix space being n2. Since membership in Singn,m does set-

theoretically only depend on the slices of a given 3-tensor, one would both hope and expect

that the "complexity" needed to describe the vanishing ideal I(Singn,m) does not increase beyond m = n2. However, we need to be careful with the precise formulation of such a

statement. For m > n2, clearly Singn,m and Singn,n2 are subvarieties of spaces of different dimensions, with different groups acting on them.

In this short section, we will show that if m grows beyond n2, the "new" equations

in the vanishing ideal In,m = I(Singn,m) of Singn,m that make use of the new variables in X(n2+1), . . . , Xm can be obtained from "old" equations in I(Singn,n2 ) via the action of GLm. To this end, we will make use of the well-known decomposition of the (graded components

of the) polynomial ring on Cm  Cn2 endowed with the left-right action of GLm × GLn2 .

Lemma 4.1. Let m, q  N. Consider CmCq with the natural left-right action of GLm × GLq, turning the ring of polynomial functions

C[Cm  Cq] = Sd(Cm  Cq)

dN

into a GLm × GLq-module. For d  N, we have the following decomposition into irreducible modules
Sd(Cm  Cq) = SCm  SCq

d
where  ranges over all nonnegative integer partitions of d.

Proof. By looking at the characters this is the celebrated Cauchy identity [4, Appendix A.13].

Remark 4.2. By definition of the Schur functor, S(Cq) = 0 whenever the partition  has more than q parts (i.e. whenever  corresponds to a Young tableau with strictly more than q rows).

Notation 4.3. For m, n, d  N, let q := n2 and fix an identification of the GLm × GLq-
modules Sd(Cm  Cq) and C[Cm  Cq]d along with embeddings of the irreducible components of Sd(Cm  Cq) into C[Cm  Cq]d.
For m > n2, we consider the inclusion I(Singn,n2 )  I(Singn,m). We choose n × n matrices of distinct variables X(1), . . . , X(m) such that C[Cm Cn Cn] = C[X(1), . . . , X(m)] and fix a monomial ordering on the variables such that all entries of X(1) are greater than all entries of X(2), which in turn are greater than those of X(3) and so forth.

Theorem 4.4. For m > n2, every irreducible subrepresentation of I(Singn,m) has the highest weight vector in I(Singn,n2).
Proof. Let V be an irreducible G-submodule of I(Singn,m)d. Then V  S(Cm)  S(Cn2 ) by the above considerations for some partition   d with at most n2 parts. The highest weight vector f  V , by definition has weight given by  [8, Chapter 10.2]. In particular, it is a linear combination of monomials that use only the variables in X(1), . . . , X(n2). That is f  I(Singn,n2 ).

Corollary 4.5. For fixed n, all ideals In,m are generated in degree at most d if and only In,n2 is generated in degree d.
Proof. Let Rn,m := C[X(1), . . . , X(m)]. The multiplication map induces a map of GLm representations:
Mm,d,d : (In,m)d  (Rn,m)d  (In,m)d+d . The image of Mm,d,d are those elements in the ideal that are of degree d + d and are generated by elements of degree d. In particular, our assumptions tell us that Mm,d,d is surjective for m = n2 and any d.
First we consider the more basic case m < n2. Let us break (In,n2 )d (resp. (Rn,n2)d , resp. (In,n2 )d+d) into a direct sum of representations I1  I2 (resp. R1  R2, resp. J1  J2) , where in I1 (resp. R1, resp. J1) are all isotypic components corresponding to Young diagrams with at most m rows and in I2 (resp. R2, resp. J2) are those with more than m rows. We note that the highest weight vectors in I1 (resp. R1, resp. J1) are exactly the highest weight vectors in (In,m)d (resp. (Rn,m)d, resp. (In,m)d+d). Further, all Young diagrams corresponding to representations in Mn2,d,d I2  (Rn,n2 )d and Mn2,d,d (In,n2 )d  (R2)d must have at least m + 1 rows. Hence, the image of I1  R1 must contain J1. For each Young diagram with at most m rows, the multiplicity of the corresponding isotypic component in the representation I1  R1 is the same as in (In,m)d  (Rn,m)d (but the representations are not the same, as these are representations of different groups). Similarly J1 and (In,m)d+d are represented by exactly the same Young diagrams. For contradiction assume that Mm,d,d is not surjective. This would mean that there is a (highest weight) vector in the kernel of Mm,d,d that, after mapping to I1  R1 is not in the kernel of Mn2,d,d. This is not possible, as multiplication of polynomials gives the same result, no matter in a ring of how many variables we regard the polynomials.
With these tools the more important case m > n2 follows easily. Indeed, to show that Mm,d,d is surjective it is enough to prove that every highest weight vector is in the image. But any highest weight vector must be in fact an element of (In,n2 )d+d. In particular, it must be in the image of the smaller space (In,n2 )d  (Rn,n2 )d  (In,m)d  (Rn,m)d .
Remark 4.6. Corollary 4.5 gives another easy proof of Theorem 3.1, as it is enough to check it for m = 4. We note that further improvements are possible, due to the fact that Singn,m is contained in a subspace variety. This topic will be explained in the forthcoming section.
5. Connections to the Fano scheme
Let In,m  C[x(ijk)] = C[Cm  Cn  Cn] be the homogeneous vanishing ideal of Singn,m. As shown in the last section, there are no 'new' generators for m > n2. This followed solely by considering the polynomial ring C[x(ijk)] and the action of GLm × GLn × GLn on it. In particular, we did not make use of the fact that we are only interested in generators of In,m.
We do this now using Fano schemes. Let Dn  Pn2-1 be the subvariety consisting of all singular matrices. Let k be a positive integer. We denote by Fk(Dn) the Fano scheme of Dn, which parametrizes the k-dimensional planes in Pn2-1 that are subvarieties of Dn.
Let X  Singm,n  Cm  Cn  Cn. Let L be the image of the flattening Cm  Cn  Cn. Since X  Singm,n every point in L is singular which means L  Dn. By definition we hence see that L  Fdim(L)-1(Dn). This Fano scheme has been extensively studied for example by Chan and Ilten in [2]. In the following we will make use of these results.
We show how to get new generators of In,m using equations coming from this Fano scheme.
Theorem 5.1. Let n > 1 and m  n2 - n + 1. The ideal In,m is not generated in degree n.
Proof. Let X = (X1, . . . , Xm)  Singn,m  Cm  Cn  Cn. Then X defines the linear subspace L = span(X1, . . . , Xm)  (Cn  Cn)m which is contained in Dn. Let k be the dimension of L, then L defines a point in Fk-1(Dn).
By [2, Proposition 2.6.] Fk-1(Dn) is empty if and only if k > n(n - 1). Since m  n2 - n + 1, we have m > k and the matrices X1, . . . , Xm are linearly dependent.

Equivalently the rank of the flattening Cm  Cn  Cn is at most n2 - n, which means that all (n2 - n + 1) × (n2 - n + 1)-minors of this map vanish. More explicitly those are the
minors of the matrix

x(1m1 ) x(1m2 ) . . . x(nmn)

if coordinates are chosen such that Xl = (x(ijl))ij for l = 1, . . . , m. By construction every subspace L coming from X  Singn,m satisfies these equations and therefore they are contained in the ideal In,m.
To show that these polynomials of In,m are not generated by the polynomials in degree
up to n we consider the group action of G = GLm  GLn  GLn on Im,n. The equations we found come from the (n2 - n + 1)-st exterior power of the flattening map Cm  (Cn  Cn). Thus correspond to n2-n+1 Cm  n2-n+1(Cn  Cn). As a G representation this is a union
of irreducible representations (with multiplicity one) indexed by triples of Young diagrams (1, . . . , 1) = 1n2-n+1, , T , where  is (any) partition of n2 - n + 1 fitting in an n × n square and T is its transpose.
By [12, Corollary B.6 and Proposition 5.1] we know that In,m up to degree n consists just of one irreducible representation indexed by the triple of Young diagrams: (n), 1n, 1n. The image of the tensor product by the multiplication map: (In,m)d  C[X(1), . . . , X(m)]d  (In,m)d+d is the part of the ideal in the degree d + d generated by elements in degree d.
Taking d = n, the domain of this map is a sum of irreducible representations indexed by
triples of Young diagrams µ1, µ2, µ3, where, by the Littlewood-Richardson rule, µ1 must contain (n) (and µ2, µ3 must contain 1n, however we do not need this). In particular, the equations we presented cannot belong to the image of the map, as 1n2-n+1 does not contain
(n).

Remark 5.2. In the case n = 2, the new equations are exactly the cubics in theorem 3.1. In the case n = 2, those are all generators of I2,m as we have seen. However, for larger n this is most likely not true.
We recall that by [12, Proposition 5.1] for any d < n the degree d component (In,m)d is {0} and for d = n we have (In,m)n = span{det( ciXi) : ci  C}.
Corollary 5.3. The ideal generated by the degree n component (In,m)n = span{det( ciXi) : ci  C} of In,m is never radical if m  n2 - n + 1.
Remark 5.4. We note that new polynomials in Im,n from theorem 5.1 were a result of rank restrictions on the map Cm  Cn  Cn. However, there are also two more canonical flattenings of tensors in Cm  Cn  Cn, namely Cn  Cm  Cn for the two different copies of Cn. In the next part we make use also of those two flattenings and show how to construct more polynomials in In,m. This new construction does not require the integer m to be as large.
Instead of fixing m immediately and working in Singm,n we consider more generally a tensor X  Cm  Cn  Cn and study its image by the flattening map in Cn  Cn.
Proposition 5.5. Let k be a positive integer and let L  CnCn be a subspace of dimension k. If L is contained in Dn and k  n2 - 2n + 2, then after a change of coordinates either every matrix in L has
(1) a zero-row, or (2) a zero-column, or

Proof. By [2, Corollary 5.1] the Fano scheme Fk-1(Dn) consists only of compression sub-
spaces, i.e. there exists 0  s  n - 1 such that L is contained in the compression space Ck-1(s). By definition this means there exists a subspace V  Cn of dimension s + 1 that is mapped to a subspace W  Cn of dimension s by every element of L.
By [2, Remark 5.2] the only possiblities for such s are s = 0, 1, n-1, n-2 if k  n2-2n+2.
These correspond exactly to the four cases in the claim.

Proposition 5.6. Let X  Singm,n. Then the map Cm  Cn  Cn has rank at most n2 - 2n + 2 or one of the two flattenings Cn  Cm  Cn has rank at most n - 1.
Proof. Let L be the image of the map Cm  Cn  Cn and denote its dimension by k. If k > n2 - 2n + 2, then by proposition 5.5 the subspace L has one of the two given forms (1), (2) in Proposition 5.5. Hence, the rank of one of the maps Cn  Cm  Cn is at most n - 1 depending if we are in case (1) or (2).

Remark 5.7. From proposition 5.6 we get more equations for Singn,m as follows. Let JM be the ideal generated by the n2 -2n+3 minors of the map Cm  Cn Cn and let J1, J2 be the ideals generated by the n minors of the other two flattenings. Then JM · J1 · J2  (In,m)n2+3.
Compared to theorem 5.1 we should consider m  n2 - 2n + 3 so that the map Cm  Cn  Cn can have large enough rank.
Using this we get equations in the case n = 3 and m = 6 whereas earlier we needed m  7
in this case.

Remark 5.8. Our theorems suggest the following idea to construct more equations for Singm,n. Consider a k-dimensional subspace L  Cn  Cn and study possible forms of this subspace using the Fano scheme Fk-1(Dn). The conditions/equations of the Fano
scheme translate to equations for Singm,n as above.

Appendix A - Code for section 3

Listing 1. Sage code verifying that the Gr¨obner basis constructed in the-

orem 3.1 is indeed a Gr¨obner basis.

1 # f1 ,..,f28 forms a basis of I_2 : Since the degree (in t_i ) is 2, this is enough. Symmetric bilinear forms are defined on e_i \times e_j.

2#

3 # T1 is the matrix containing the first rows of all matrices M1 ,..., M6.

4 # T2 contains the first columns.

5 # T3 contains the second rows.

6 # T4 contains the second columns.

7#

8 # Mini contains "all" bordered determinants .

9#

10 # We generate J by all these bordered determinants , I_2 and the products of 2 x2 minors of the T_i .

11 # These are not needed to generate the radical but are needed for the Groebner basis .

12 # They are contained in the radical by looking at the Fano scheme of P1 x P1 .
