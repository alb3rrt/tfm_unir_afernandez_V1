Abstract

This article provides the domain of existence  of the Laplace transform of infinitely divisible

negative multinomial distributions. We define a negative multinomial distribution on Nn, where N

is the set of nonnegative integers, by its probability generating function which will be of the form

(A (a1z1, . . . , anzn) /A (a1, . . . , an))- where A (z) =

aT zi, where a = 0, and where

T {1,2,...,n} iT

 is a positive number. Finding couples (A, ) for which we obtain a probability generating function

is a difficult problem. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the coefficients aT of A for which we

obtain a probability generating function for any positive number  are know by (Bernardoff, 2003).

Thus we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on a = (a1, . . . , an) so that a = et1 , . . . , etn

with t = (t1, . . . , tn) belonging to . This makes it possible to construct all the infinitely divisible multinomial distributions on Nn. We give examples of construction in dimensions 2 and 3.

1 Introduction

In this article, we consider the following definition, see references in Bernardoff (2003). We shall say that

the probability distribution

p on Nn, where n is a non negative number, is a negative multinomial

Nn

distribution if there exists an affine polynomial P (z1, . . . , zn) and  > 0 such that P (0, . . . , 0) = 0, and

P (1, . . . , 1) = 1.

pz11 · · · znn = (P (z1, . . . , zn))- .

(1)

Nn

2 That means a polynomial which is affine with respect to each zj, j = 1, · · · , n, or for which zj2 P = 0 for

all j = 1, . . . , n. That is P (z1, . . . , zn) =

aT zT , where Pn is the set of the subset of {1, 2, . . . , n} =

T Pn

[n] , and where zT = tT zt.if z = (z1, . . . , zn)  Rn. For instance, for n = 2, such as P has the form

P (z1, z2) = a + a{1}z1 + a{2}z2 + a{1,2}z1z2 with a = 0. However, finding exactly which pairs (P, )

are compatible is an unsolved problem.

Before giving the main result, let us make an observation. If = (1, . . . , n)  Nn, then we denote

n

z = zii = z11 . . . znn .

i=1

Let A be any polynomial such that A (0, . . . , 0) = 1, and suppose that the Taylor expansion

(A (z1, . . . , zn))- =

c () z

Nn

has non-negative coefficients c () . Let a1, . . . , an be positive numbers such that

Nn c () a1 1 . . . ann <

defined by

A (a1, . . . , an)

thus

P

(z1, . . . , zn)

=

A (a1z1, . . . , anzn) A (a1, . . . , an)

(4)

in the notation (1).

Bernardoff (2003) define the polynomials bT by

Definition 1 Let P (z) =

aT zT be an affine polynomial P (z1, . . . , zn) such that P (0, . . . , 0) = 0,

T Pn
and A = 1 - P . Let T be in Pn the set of the nonempty subset of [n] let us denote by bT the number

defined by

|T |

bT

=

zT

(log (1 - P ))

,
0

where then |T | is the cardinal of T and zT = tT zt, then

|T |

bT = (l - 1)!

aT

(5)

l=1

T lT

where T is the set of the partition of T , and lT is the set of the partition of lenght l of T (if T = {T1, T2, . . . , Tl} , the partition T of T is of length l).

For instance, for n = 3, b{1} = a{1}, b{1,2} = a{1,2} + a{1}a{2} and b{1,2,3} = a{1,2,3} + a{1}a{2,3} + a{2}a{1,3} + a{3}a{1,2} + 2a{1}a{2}a{3}. Now, if there is no ambiguity, for simplicity we omit the braces.
Using the numbers bT , Bernardoff (2003) proves the following theorem.

Theorem 2 Let P (z) =

aT zT , as before, and suppose that (1 - P (z))- =
T Pn

Nn c () z.

Then c () 0 for all positive  if and only if bT , given by (5), is non negative for all T  Pn.

See examples in dimension n = 2, 3 in Bernardoff (2003). This article is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the main result. Section 3 applies the main result to bivariate and trivariate cases.

2 Domain of existence of the Laplace transform

Let A be an affine polynomial on Rn and let  > 0 such that A (0, . . . , 0) = 1 and such that (A (z1, . . . , zn))- =

c () z satisfies c () > 0 for all  in Nn. Consider the discrete measure on Nn, µ =

c () .

Nn
The present section aims to describe the convex set

Nn

D (µ) =   Rn,

c () e11+···+nn < + ,

Nn

which is an important object in order to study the natural exponential family generated by µ (see Letac,

1991 and Bar-Lev et al., 1994). The answer is contained in the following Proposition.

Theorem 3 With the above notation, denote H = {s  Rn, s1 + · · · + sn = 0} . For s H, we denote

by Rs the smallest positive zero of the polynomial Ps (t) = A (tes1 , . . . , tesn ). Then the map s  s +

log Rs (1, . . . , 1) is a parametrization by H of a hypersurface in Rn which is the boundary of D (µ) .

More

specifically

if



is

in

Rn

and

if

n

=

1 n (1 + · · · + n)

and

if

s

=



- n (1, . . . , 1) ,

then



is

in

D (µ) if and only if n < log Rs.

Finally D (µ) is an open set.

Proof We first prove that the radius of convergence R of the power series

Ps- (t) = un () tn

(6)

nN

is equal to Rs. This comes from the following fact: since un () 0, a known result in theory of 3

analytic functions (see Titchmarsh (1939) 7.21) implies that t  Ps- (t) is not analytic at R. Since Ps (0) = 1, Ps (t) > 0 for 0 < t < Rs and Ps (Rs) = 0 clearly R = Rs.
We now observe that if = (1, . . . , n) is such that
c () e11+···+nn < +
Nn

then for all p 0 we have
c () e1(1-p)+···+n(n-p) < +.
Nn

We now fix  in D (µ) . Write n = (1 + · · · + n) /n. The orthogonal projection of  on H is

s =  - n (1, . . . , 1) = (s1, . . . , sn). Thus for all j = 1, . . . , n we have j - sj = n. We claim that

n < log Rs. If not, we have t0 =en Rs. But A e1 , . . . en is Ps (t0) and the previous remark

shows that for all p 0, p  Ps (e-pt0) is always positive. This contradicts the fact that t0 Rs.

Conversely if  is such that n < log Rs with s =  - n (1, . . . , 1) a similar reasoning shows that

  D (µ) .

Finally for t = Rs in (6) the series diverges. A short proof goes as follows:

t

t

t

Write Ps (t) =

1- r0

1- ··· 1-

r1

rk

where |rj|

r0 = Rs by definition of Rs.

Thus

un () tn is the product of Newton Series

1 n!  n

nN

nN

t rk

n
and the series corresponding

to k = 0 diverges for t = r0. Thus un () r0n = +.

nN

Remark 4 With the notations of Theorem 3, if  is in the boundary of D (µ), s  H,  =

s + log Rs (1, . . . , 1) , then zi =ei = Rsesi for i  [n] , and

A (z1, . . . , zn) = A (Rses1 , . . . , Rsesn ) = 0,

by the definition of Rs.

3 Examples in dimensions 2 and 3

Example 1. For n = 2, we take a1 = 1, a2 = 1 and a1,2 = a -1 so that the conditions of Theorem

2 are satisfied. Hence A (z1, z2) = 1 - z1 - z2 - az1z2. For z1 = tes1 , z2 = tes2 , with s1 + s2 = 0 we

have

A (z1, z2)

=

1 - t (es1

+ e-s1 ) - at2.

Remark 5 Using the Remark 4 we obtain an other parametrization of the boundary of D (u) :

1 < 0, 2 = - log 1 + (a + 1) / e-1 - 1 .

In addition, because D (µ) is a convex set,  = (1, 2)  D (µ) is defined by

1 < 0, 2 < - log 1 + (a + 1) / e-1 - 1 .

(7)



In this case, for a = -1/2, Rs = 2 cosh s1 - 2 cosh 2s1 and if we choose s1 = 0, the condition





2 < log Rs becomes 2 < - log 1 + 2/2 . As 2 = - log 2 < - log 1 + 2/2 , then (- log 2, - log 2) 

D (µ).

Then, the introduction proves that (A

z2

/A

1 2

,

1 2

)-

= (8 - 4z1 - 4z2 + z1z2)-

is

a

generating function for all  > 0.

Remark 6 For a = -1/2, the condition 7 gives for 1 = - log 2, 2 < - log (3/2) , and 2 = - log 2 is

suitable. Hence (- log 2, - log 2)  D (µ) .

with

a

if

we

choose

s1

Rs

=

-

17, then 2 = -2 log 2 < log Rs and

 = s + 2 (1, 1) = (- log 2, -3 log 2).

Then, the introduction proves that (A

is

for

 > 0.

Remark 7 For a = -1/2, the condition 7 gives for 1 = - log 2, 2 < - log (3/2) , and 2 = -3 log 2 is suitable. Hence (- log 2, -3 log 2)  D (µ) . This method is easier to use.

Example 2. For n = 3, the conditions of Theorem 2 are for i, j = 1, 2, 3: bi = ai 0 ; aij -aiaj ; a123 - (a1a23 + a2a13 + a3a12 + 2a1a2a3) We take a1 = a2 = a3 = 1, a12 = a13 = a23 = a and a123 = b, so that

A (z) = 1 - ((z1 + z2 + z3) + a (z1z2 + z1z3 + z2z3) + bz1z2z3) .

5

The conditions of Theorem 2 are satisfied for a -1 and b -3a - 2. We take a = 1 and b = 0, hence

A (z) = 1 - z1 - z2 - z3 - z1z2 - z1z3 - z2z3.

Let z1 = tes1 , z2 = tes2 and z3 = tes2 , with s1 + s2 + s3 = 0, then Ps (t) = 1 - (es1 + es2 + e-s1-s2 ) t - (e-s1 + e-s2 + es1+s2 ) t2 = 0, and we have

-es1 - es2 - e-s1-s2 + Rs =

e2s1 + e2s2 + 6es1+s2 + e-2(s1+s2) + 6e-s1 + 6e-s2 .

Finally, the parametrization of the boundary of D (u) is:

Remark 8 In this case, using the Remark 4 we obtain that an other definition of  = (1, 2, 3)  the

boundary of D (u) is :

1 - e1 - e2 - e1+2

1 < 0, 2 < - log 1 + e1 , 3 = log

z = 3 = log

In addition, because D (µ) is a convex set,  = (1, 2, 3)  D (µ) is defined by

1 + e1

1 - e1 - e2 - e1+2

1 < 0, 2 < - log 1 - e1 , 3 < log
