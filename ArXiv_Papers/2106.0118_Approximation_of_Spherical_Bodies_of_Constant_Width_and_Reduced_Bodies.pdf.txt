1 Introduction
A theorem of Blaschke says that for every convex body of constant width w in the Euclidean plane E2 and every  > 0 there exists a convex body of constant width w whose boundary consists only of pieces of circles of radius w such that the Hausdorff distance between the two bodies is at most  (see [1] and also §65 of [2]). A generalization of this fact for normed planes is given in [6], where also approximation of reduced bodies is considered. Corollary at the end of this note presents an analog of this theorem for bodies of constant width on the sphere S2, while Theorem gives a general version for reduced convex bodies on S2.
The method of the proof of Theorem is similar to the proofs from [1] (by Blaschke) and [6]. In order to facilitate the reader a comparison of the present proof with this from [6], in Section 4 we use the notation from [6]. In the present paper we need a number of lemmas and claims for the spherical situation. They are given in Sections 2 and 3.

2 Auxiliary facts from spherical geometry
Let S2 be the unit sphere of the three-dimensional Euclidean space E3. By a great circle we mean the intersection of S2 with any two-dimensional subspace of E3. By a pair of antipodes we mean any pair of points obtained as the intersection of S2 with a one-dimensional subspace of E3. Observe that if two different points a, b are not antipodes, then there is exactly one great circle containing them. By the arc of great circle, or shortly arc, ab connecting them we understand the shorter part of the great circle between a and b. By the distance |ab|, of these points we mean the length of ab.

semicircle. We say that p is the center of this semicircle.

A subset of S2 is called convex if it does not contain any pair of antipodes and if together with every two points it contains the arc connecting them. For a set A  S2 we denote by

conv(A) the smallest convex set containing A. By a convex body we mean a closed convex set

with non-empty interior. We say that e is an extreme point of C provided the set C \ {e} is

convex.

If hemispheres G and H are different and their centers are not antipodes, then L = G  H is

called a lune. The semicircles bounding L and contained respectively in bd(G) and bd(H) are

denoted by G/H and H/G. The thickness (L) of L is defined as the distance of the centers of

G/H and H/G. Let p be a boundary point of a set A  S2. We say that a great circle G supports A if

G has non-empty intersection with A and A lies in one of the hemispheres bounded by G. If

p  G  A, we say that G supports A at p. This hemisphere is called a supporting hemisphere of

A. If the centers of both the semicircles bounding a lune belong to C, then we call such a lune

a supporting lune of C.

Recall a few notions and facts from [7]. For every hemisphere K supporting a convex body

C we are finding hemispheres K supporting C such that the lunes K  K are of the minimum

thickness. At least one such a K exists. By the width widthK (C) of C determined by K we

mean the thickness of the lune K  K. It changes continuously, as the position of K changes.

From

Part

I

of

Theorem

1

of

[7]

we

know

that

such

K

is

unique

if

widthK (C)

<

.

When we go on bd(C), then always counterclockwise. Let us recall, but in a slightly different

form than in [10], that for supporting hyperplanes X, Y, Z of a convex body C in this order we write  XY Z. By the first (last) lune supporting a convex body C  S2 at a boundary point p

we mean the first (respectively, last) supporting lune of this body which contains p.

By the thickness (C) of C we mean the minimum of widthK(C) over all supporting hemispheres K of C. If a lune L of thickness (C) contains C, the arc connecting the midpoints of

the semicircles bounding L is called a thickness chord of C. By Claim 2 of [7] its end-points are

in bd(C). This notion is an analog of the notion of a thickness chord of a convex body in Ed

considered by many authors under this name or without any name, as for instance in [2].

If for all hemispheres K supporting C the numbers widthK(C) are equal, we say that C is of constant width.

Lemma 1. Let A  S2 be a closed set with non-empty interior. If at every boundary point the set A is supported by a hemisphere, then A is convex.

Proof. The proof is analogous to the proof of Theorem 9 of [3]. Namely, suppose that A is not convex. Then there are points x1, x2  A and a point y  x1x2 such that y  A. There exists a point z  int(A) such that z  x1x2. Hence there is xf  bd(A)  yz. Every great circle through

M. Lassak / Approximation of reduced bodies on sphere

xf separates one of the points x1, x2, z from at least one other of these points. So there is no supporting hemisphere of A through xf . A contradiction.

Lemma 2. Consider a non-degenerate spherical triangle abd and a point e  ab such that de is orthogonal to ab. The distance between d and ab is at most

Here is a spherical version of the classic Blaschke selection theorem.

Claim 1. From every sequence of convex bodies on Sd of thickness at most a constant smaller than  we may select a subsequence which tends to a spherical convex body.

Proof. First select a subsequence which is contained in a fixed spherical disk of a radius below . Then from this subsequence select the final subsequence (see [7] p. 558 and [5]).

3 Reduced bodies on sphere

After [7] we say that a spherical convex body R is reduced if (Z) < (R) for every convex

body Z  R different from R. For basic properties of reduced bodies on S2 see [10]. The class

of spherical reduced bodies is larger than the class of bodies of constant width. Earlier many

papers considered reduced bodies in the Euclidean and normed d-dimensional spaces; see the

survey articles [8] and [9].

Theorem 3.1 of [10] presents the boundary structure of a reduced body R  S2 of thickness

below

 2

.

Namely, assume that M1, M2 are supporting hemispheres of R with widthM1(R) =

(R) = widthM2(R) such that widthM (R) > (R) for every M fulfilling  M1M M2. Consider

the lunes L1 = M1  M1 and L2 = M2  M2. Then the arcs a1a2 and b1b2 are in bd(R), where

ai is the center of Mi/Mi and bi is the center of Mi/Mi for i = 1, 2.

Denote by c the intersection point of the arcs a1a2 and b1b2. The union of the triangles a1a2c

and b1b2c is called a butterfly, while a1a2 and b1b2 its arms.

Consider any maximum piece gh of the boundary of R which does not contain any arc (so

the starting point g of gh is an ending point of an arc or a sequence of arcs, and the ending

point h is a starting point of an arc or a sequence of arcs).

Let K be any hemisphere supporting R at a point of gh. But at g only the first, and at h

only the last. By Part I of Theorem 1 of [7] for every K there exists exactly one hemisphere K

supporting R such that the lune K  K has thickness widthK (R). From this theorem we also

conclude that K touches R at a unique point. In particular, for the first hemisphere supporting

R at g denote this unique point by g, and for the last hemisphere supporting R at h by h.

4

Claim 2. For any hemisphere K supporting R at a point of gh we have widthK(R) = (R).

Proof. Clearly, widthK(R) cannot be smaller than (R), because then we get a contradiction with the definition of the thickness of R.

Suppose that widthK(R) > (R). Then by continuity arguments (see Theorem 2 of [7]) we obtain that if K supports R at a point different from g and h, then there are supporting

hemispheres

K1

and

K2

with



K1 K K2

such

that

for

every

supporting

hemisphere

H

fulfilling


 K1HK2 we have (H) > (R). By the just recalled Theorem 3.1 of [10], the piece gh of the



boundary of R contains an arc. A contradiction with the assumption on gh from the paragraph



preceding our claim. If K supports R at g or h, then similarly we show that gh contains an arc



whose one end-point is g or h, which again gives a contradiction with the choice of gh.

By the two preceding paragraphs we get widthK(R) = (R).

From this claim and Lemma 2.2 of [10] we see that all the points at which all our hemispheres



K touch R form a curve gh being a piece of bd(R). We call it the curve opposite to the curve











gh. Vice-versa, from this lemma we obtain that gh determines gh. So we say that gh and gh

is a pair of opposite curves of constant width (R). Let us summarize the above consideration

as the following claim analogous to Corollary 11 of [4] on the situation in a normed plane.

Claim 3. The boundary of a reduced body R  S2 consists of countably many pairs of arms of butterflies and of countably many pairs of opposite pairs of curves of constant width (R).

Clearly any particular pair of opposite pieces of curves of constant width (R) consists of end-points of thickness chords; they are the midpoints of the lunes of thickness (R) supporting R at the points of these pieces of curves of constant width.

Consider any pair F, G of opposite curves of constant width in the boundary of R. Excep-

tionally, when R is a body of constant width, we divide bd(R) into a pair of curves F and G by

an arbitrary thickness chord. Denote the endpoints of F by f  and f , and the endpoints of G

by g and g, in both cases according to positive orientation.

Part A. The aim of this part is to construct the set R. From Claim 3 we know that bd(R) contains countably many pairs of opposite pieces of curves of constant width (R). For each such a pair F, G we provide a number of different thickness

.

Clearly,

some of points f1, . . . , fn (some of g1, . . . , gn) can coincide.

Denote by oi the intersection point of figi and fi+1gi+1 for i = 1, . . . , n - 1 (see Figure).

Moreover, denote by i (respectively, i) the angle between the rays from oi through fi and fi+1

(respectively, through gi and gi+1) for i = 1, . . . , n - 1. Let ci  i be a point of intersection

of circles of radius (R) with centers fi and fi+1 (so ci is in equal distances from fi and fi+1).

Such ci exists since, thanks to Claim 2, we have |figi+1|  (R) and |fi+1gi|  (R). Moreover,

by c0 we mean g, and by cn we mean g.

For every i  {1, . . . , n - 1} take the arc Fi of the circle Fi of radius (R) with center ci and

endpoints fi and fi+1 which is in i. Moreover, for i  {1, . . . , n} take the arc Gi of the circle

Gi of radius (R) with center fi which begins at ci-1 and ends at ci. Created arcs are marked

by broken lines in Figure. Clearly, G1  1, Gi  i-1  i for i = 2, . . . , n - 1, and Gn  n-1.

We have constructed the pair of curves F  = F1  . . .  Fn-1 and G = G1  . . .  Gn. We define

R as the set bounded by U.

Denote by U the closure of the union of all arms of the butterflies of R and of all pairs of

curves of the form F  and G. We see that U is obtained from bd(R) by exchanging all pairs

of opposite curves F and G by the constructed pairs of curves F  and G.

Part B. We define a sequence of convex sets Rj.

We define R0, R1, . . . by induction. Here R0 = R. Clearly it is a convex body. Assume that Rj-1 is a convex body. We get the boundary of Rj by exchanging a pair of

6

M. Lassak / Approximation of reduced bodies on sphere

opposite curves F, G, if any remains, from bd(Rj-1) into a pair F  and G as done in Part A. Clearly, at every boundary point p, the set Rj is supported by a hemisphere. If p  F   G
this follows from the fact that here Rj is supported by a lune of thickness (R). If p  bd(Rj) does not belong to the curves F  and G, then in the part of the supporting hemisphere take this supporting Rj-1. From Lemma 1 we conclude that Rj is convex. Moreover, since conv(F   G) has nonempty interior, Rj also has nonempty interior. Hence Rj is a convex body.
Part C. We show that R is a convex body and (R) = (R).
If after a finite number of steps we get R, we see that it is convex. In the opposite case, R = limjRj. By Claim 1 we see that R is also a convex body.
From the construction of Rj we see that for every supporting hemisphere K of Rj of every F  and every G we have widthK = (R). The remaining part of bd(Rj) does not differ from bd(Rj-1). So by induction we get (Rj) = (R). Thus if after a finite number of steps we obtain R, it has thickness (R). By Lemma 4 of [7], if R = limjRj, then the same is true.
Part D. Let us prove that R is a reduced body.
We should show that for any convex body Z  R different from R the inequality (Z) < (R) holds true. The body Z does not contain an extreme point e of R as it follows from the spherical analog of the Krein-Millman theorem formulated on p. 565 of [7]. Consequently, Z is disjoint with an open disk D centered at e.
By the definition of R in Part A, every point of bd(R) belongs to the closure of the union of all arms of the butterflies of R, or to the union of all curves of the form F  and G.
If D has nonempty intersection with a curveF  or G, from the construction of these curves we see that (conv(R \ D)) < (R). Since Z  conv(R \ D), we get (Z) < (R).
In the opposite case, the construction of R implies that there is an open disk D  D centered at e such that D  bd(R) = D  bd(R) and that this set has empty intersection with all curves of the form F  and G in bd(R), and with all curves of the form F and G in bd(R). Thus from the construction of R and (R) = (R) we see that (conv(R\D)) = (conv(R\D)). Thus the inequality (conv(R \ D)) < (R) (resulting by the reducedness of R), and (R) = (R) imply that (conv(R \ D)) < (R). So from Z  conv(R \ D) we get (Z) < (R).
Since (Z) < (R) in both cases, we see that R is a reduced body.
Part E. We show that every F  and every G are in the union of some triangles.
Take a pair of curves F  and G constructed in Part A. The bounding semicircle of the first lune supporting R at fi is denoted by Ki, and that at gi by Li (again see Figure).
For i  {1, . . . , n - 1}, by ki denote the point of intersection of Ki with Ki+1 (if they are subsets of a great circle, take ki as the midpoint of fifi+1). By li denote the point of intersection of Li with Li+1 (if they are subsets of a great circle, take li as the midpoint of gigi+1).
For every c  Gi take the lune supporting R such that cfi is the thickness chord. and denote by T (c) the bounding semicircle of this lune through fi. In particular, T (gi) = Ki. When we move c  Gi counterclockwise from gi to ci, the lune and thus also T (c) "rotate" counterclockwise. So since the distance between ci and any point of T (ci) is at least (R) we

M. Lassak / Approximation of reduced bodies on sphere

7

see that the distance from ci to every point of the arc fiki is at least (R). Analogously, the distance from ci to any point of fi+1ki is at least (R). So since every point of Fi is at the distance (R) from ci, we get Fi  fikifi+1. Thus F  is contained in the union of triangles fikifi+1, where i = 1, . . . , n. Similarly, G is in the union of triangles giligi+1, where i = 1, . . . , n.

Part F. We show that the Hausdorff distance between R and R is at most .

Denote by P the closure of the convex hull of all points fi and gi and of endpoints of all

arms of butterflies of R. Denote by Q the union of P and all triangles fikifi+1 and giligi+1.

Part E implies inclusions P  R  Q and P  R  Q. So in order to estimate the

Hausdorff distance between R and R by  it is sufficient to estimate the Hausdorff distance

between P and Q by . Since P  Q, the Hausdorff distance between them is supqQ infpP |pq|.

Hence it is sufficient to show that all (i.e., for all pairs F , G and all i) distances between ki and

fifi+1, and also between li and gigi+1, are at most .

Since the sum of angles of the quadrangle oifikifi+1 is over 2, from the assumption in Part A

Analogously, the distance between li

between R and R, is at most .

If R is a body of constant width, from Parts A and B of this proof we see that R (so R1 in this case) is also a body of constant width. So we get the following corollary.

Corollary. For every body W  S2 of constant width and for arbitrary  > 0 there exists a body W  S2 of constant width (W) = (W ) whose boundary consists only of arcs of circles of radius (W ), such that the Hausdorff distance between W and W is at most .

Applications for Barbier's theorem in Part 4 of [6] do not hold true here for the sphere. Let us correct misprints in this Part 4 on p. 873: three times 2 should be exchanged into .
