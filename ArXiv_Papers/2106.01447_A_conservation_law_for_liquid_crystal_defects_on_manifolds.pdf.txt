A conservation law for liquid crystal defects on manifolds.

arXiv:2106.01447v2 [math.AP] 8 Jun 2021

1 Introduction
The liquid crystalline phase is an intermediate state of matter between solid crystal and isotropic liquid, possessing orientational ordering but not positional [7, 18]. There are three major classes of liquid crystals, we shall consider the nematic phase only; liquid crystals in the nematic phase are aggregates of rod-like molecules whose preferred direction of alignment is parallel to its neighbour molecules. One of the key features of liquid crystals are point defects, which are points of discontinuity in the preferred direction of the liquid crystal, they can occur naturally in a system either by the geometry of the domain [1] or by boundary conditions [12]. We shall be consider a thin film of nematic liquid crystal coating a curved surface, this is referred to as a nematic shell [14]. Nematic shells have a wide variety of technological applications ranging from catalysis, photonic band gap materials and creation of colloidal materials using DNA strands [15], however the most novel application is to contact lenses that can change their refractive index and dioptre [2].
This piece can be viewed in two parts, the first part is the derivation of a conservation law for defects in a nematic shell, this shall be similar to the Poincar´e-Hopf theorem however we shall consider domains with boundaries and their impact on the sum total of defects. The second part is investigating the bulk energy of defects in a nematic shell, as we shall be considering an energy density similar to the one constant approximation of the Frank free energy [5] the presence of non-zero defects shall result in a divergence in the energy density. This allows us to consider local energies about defects and minimise the rate of divergence with respect to the defect strengths, thus allowing us to predict what families of defects shall appear.

2 Topology Preamble

2.1 Surface assumptions.
Consider S  R3, an orientable two-dimensional manifold embedded in three dimensions, which is such that there exists an open, connected and bounded set   R2, and a single smooth chart x-1 : S   with inverse x  C2(, S). The regularity of the boundary S shall be discussed in the next section. We can form a "natural trihedron", a set of local basis vectors {e1, e2, N} relative to the surface

xi :=

x ,

i

ei

:=

xi |xi| ,

x1 × x2 N := |x1 × x2| , for  := (1, 2)  .

We shall assume that the parametersiation of the surface x is such that the natural trihedron forms an orthogonal basis x1 · x2() = 0 for all   . The function

F :=

1 |x2 |

 |x1 | 2

of

the

first

fundamental

form's

and

is

important

in

defining concepts such as the Gaussian Curvature. A notable example would be if S is a surface of

revolution, for a sufficiently smooth cross-section.

2.2 Boundary assumptions.
The Poincar´e-Hopf theorem [4], is a conservation law for tangential vector fields on a closed surface (such as a torus or a sphere) or for tangential fields with boundary data equal to the outward pointing normal of the boundary to the surface. We seek to generalise this principle for surfaces with piecewise smooth

1

boundaries and for vector fields with sufficiently regular boundary conditions. In this section we seek to

parameterise the boundary S, of the surface S, and describe its regularity.

Assume that the boundary S  R3 can be partitioned into a finite number of closed components,

denoted S1, . . . , SM for M  N. We shall ignore the case when M = 0, as there is no boundary (a

torus or a sphere are classic examples) and thus the Poincar´e-Hopf theorem may be applied.

We

parameterise

each

boundary

component

Si

by

the

function


i



C([0, li], Si)

where:

·

li

>

0

is

the

arclength

of

the

curve

Si

and

the

function


i

is

parameterised

by

its

arclength,

consequently | | = 1.

i

·

 (0)
i

=

i(li)

because

Si

is

a

closed

curve.

· There exist a finite number of values 0 =: li0 < . . . < lin := li where the curve is not twice

differentiable:
ni


i

C2((lij-1, lij ), Si),

j=1

these are called the verticies of Si.

We notice that the parameterisation is twice differentiable on closed intervals that implies that the Geodesic curvature is integrable:

The function iS : [0, li)  (-, ) describes the exterior angle of the boundary , and is defined point-wise by

2.3 Triangulation Definition.

Definition 1. An open subregion SR  S is simple if it is homeomorphic to a disk and its boundary SR is parameterised by  : [0, l]  SR which satisfies the assumptions from section 2.2. The simple subregion SR  S is a triangle if the corresponding exterior angle function  : [0, l)  (-, ) is such that |supp( )| = 3. For a triangle T  S, let {s1, s2, s3} = supp( ) be such that s1 < s2 < s3. We define the set of vertices VT  T and the set of edges ET  T by:

VT :=

(si)

3,
i=1

ET

:=

(s) s  (0, s1)  (s3, l) , (s) s  (s1, s2) , (s) s  (s2, s3)

(2)

In this piece we derive our main result by considering partitioning the domain into simple triangular subregions, we then derive a smaller result for each simple region and use that to derive the main result. The simple subregions will be important in the integration of various curvatures and angles, additionally they are used in the definition of a particular partition, known as a Triangulation of the surface, those familiar with finite element methods would have an illustration of this principle.

Definition 2. Let us assume that S is such that there exists a finite partition {Ti}Fi=1 , for such that each face Ti  S is a triangle, let F  N denote the number of faces, and that the edge of a triangle is
not "split" by a vertex of another triangle:

Ti  Tj = ETi  ETj , i = j.

We denote the number of vertices of this triangulation by V :=
F
similarly E := ETi . For a given triangulation of S, the number
i=1

F
VTi
i=1

and the number of edges

 := F - E + V,

is called the Euler characteristic of the triangulation. It is important to note that the Euler characteristic is invariant with respect to the choice of triangulation and thus is referred to as the Euler characteristic of the surface S.

We wish to define our admissible class of unit vector fields, which are tangential to the surface S permit the existence of "point defects" but no defects of any other type, and can satisfy the Poincar´e­Hopf theorem.

Definition 3. We say that u : S  S2 is of the class Atan if and only if there exists a vector field A : S  R3 whose components are real analytic with isolated zeros, such that

A

A(x()) · N() = 0,   , u := , a.e S.

(3)

|A|

The choice of isolated zeros, of the corresponding analytic function, implies that there exists a discrete finite set Ju  S such that u  C(S \ Ju, S2), which is the set of discontinuities of the vector field u and corresponds to the isolated zeros of A:

Ju := s  S |A(s) = 0 .

(4)

The parameterisation x was assumed to be bijective, as such there exists a x-1  C(S, ) such that
x  x-1 = Id and x-1  x = IdS, we use this to construct the following decomposition. As u  Atan is orthogonal to the normal N, we may construct the following decomposition, there exists (u1, u2)  C(S \ Ju, S1) such that

u(s) = u1(s)e1(x-1(s)) + u2(s)e2(x-1(s)), s  S \ Ju.

(5)

2.4 Curvature definitions.

As we are considering a vector field on a curved surface, this motivates the question "how do we differ-
entiate with respect to curved space?", the answer is the covariant derivative and Christoffel symbols. For i, j, k = 1, 2, we define the Christoffel symbols of the second kind kij and the functions of the second fundamental form Lij, by the following:

xij

:=

2x ij

= kij xk + Lij N,

kij

:=

xij · xk |xk|2 ,

Lij := xij · N,

21j

|x2| |x1|

=

Fj .

as a direct consequence we have that

e1 j

=

Fj e2

+

L1j |x1|

N,

e2 j

= -Fje1 +

L2j |x2|

N

Consider a curve   C1([0, L], S) parametrised by its arclength, we wish to consider the derivative

 t

u  (t)

and understand how it affected by the curvatures kij and Lij.

We shall establish some

notation before we proceed, recall that we assumed that x is bijective, thus there exists a curve  

C1([0, L], ) such that  = x  ; additionally we denote the following restrictions u^ := u  , u^i := ui  ,

e^i

:=

ei

N^

:=

F^

and

A^ij

For a given u  Atan with components (u1, u2)  C(S \ Ju, S1) the derivative is given by

du^ =

du^2 dt

+ u^1

u^iAij j N^ .

i,j=1

In this piece we wish to consider derivatives with respect to the curved surface, as our vector field is tangent and does not have a normal component, this motivates us to consider a derivative with the same property. Consequently we define the co-variant derivative as the projection of the derivative into the tangent plane

Du^ du^ := -
dt dt

du^ · N^ N^ = dt

du^1 dt

- u^2

· F^

e^1 +

du^2 dt

As

u^

is

both

unit

and

tangential

to

the

surface

we

have

that

Du^ dt

is

orthogonal

to

both

u^

and

Du^ Du =

This function is known as the Algebraic value, and can be used to define important curvatures. One such curvature is the "Geodesic curvature" denoted kg : [0, L]  R, which is the Algebraic value of the vector  , which shall be used later in the derivation of the main result. Additionally, the Algebraic value can be used to define the angle between two unit tangent vectors. For v  Atan let v^ := v  , the Algebraic value can be used to define the derivative of the angle u,v : [0, 1]  R from u^ to v^,

du,v = Dv - Du .

As a direct consequence of the above and the orthogonality of our basis, the derivative of the angle from u^ to e^1, denoted  : (0, L)  R is given by

The function  will be key in defining the index of a vector field on a manifold.

surface S is given by

2.5 Strength of a defect

We can characterise a discontinuity by its Index (or defect strength in the context of liquid crystals, winding number if the surface is planar or degree of the mapping).

Definition 4. Let SR  S be simple and with sufficiently smooth, positively oriented boundary SR with

parameterisation



:

[0, L]



SR,

such

that

d ds

is

integrable

in

(0, L),

then

the

index

of

u

in

SR

is

defined to be

L

1 d

Index(u, SR) := 2

ds, ds

0

where  is the angle from u^ to e^1.

The choice in the parameterisation  implies that SR is such that |SR  Ju| = {0, 1}, where the
set Ju is given in equation (4), thus we can only have one boundary defect in R. However, a reader
might wonder "what if |R  Ju| 2?" or "what if I want to know the index of a vector field on a
non-simple domain?". The answer to both of those can be answered by the homotopy properties of the index. Considering an exact cover of simple domains SR1 , SR2 , . . . , SRN  S, which satisfy the boundary
N
assumptions. The index of SRi is given by [13]
i=1

N

Index u, SRi := Index(u, SRi ).

i=1

i=1

This notion of a partition of a domain into regular components will be essential in the proof of the main result. However, the use of Algebraic values is rather cumbersome to use as a definition of the index, thus we wish to express the index as an integral of the components (u1, u2) of u.

Lemma 2. Let u  Atan have the decomposition given by equation (5) then we have that

1 Index(u, SR) = 2

u1du2 - u2du1.

Proof. The definition of the Algebraic value from equation (6) and the decomposition of u from equation (5) implies that

which

when

3 Topological charge conservation law for a simple domain

Recall the assumption that the transformation x is bijective and smooth, this implies that there exists a simple R   with boundary parametrised by  such that x(R) = SR. As the domain R is simple we can apply Green's theorem to the right hand side to deduce that

L
d Du -

We now applying the definition of Gaussian curvature for orthogonal parametrisation, equation (9), we

deduce that

Finally applying the definition of integration with respect to curvilinear co-ordinates we have that |x1||x2|d = d, giving our result.

Lemma 4. For a surface S, satisfying the assumptions from sections (2.1)-(2.2), the Gauss-Bonnet

theorem states that
VS

2(S) = kg ds + K d + i.

(11)

S

S

i=1

Utilising these two lemmas, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and the definition of boundary index, we can derive a conservation law for the interior defects on simple surfaces.

Theorem 1. Let SR  S be a simple domain with sufficiently smooth boundary SR which is parametrised by a  : [0, L]  SR (which is parametrised by its arclength L > 0), additionally we denote the exterior angles of SR by i  (-, ) for i = 1, . . . Ve,SR . For a u  Atan we have that

VSR

2 =

i + dt dt + 2Index(u, SR),

i=1

SR

(12)

where  is the angle between u^ and the unit tangent to the boundary  .

Proof. The definition of a simple domain implies that it is homeomorphic to a disk, consequently it has Euler characteristic  = 1. Applying the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for R we deduce that

VSR

i=1

The boundary of SR being parametrised by its arclength implies that, | | = 1 we can substituting in equation (10) to deduce that

where  is the angle between u^ and e^1. Firstly we apply the definition of index from equation (4) to

Secondly,

we

recall

that

the

is defined to be the algebraic value of . Finally we use equation (7), to express that the integral of

the derivative of the angle between two vectors is given by the difference of their algebraic values, which

obtains our result.

4 Topological charge conservation law for a non-simple domain
In the previous section we derived a conservation law for a tangential vector field on a simple domain, we shall use this to generalise to any sufficiently smooth surface. We shall do this by partitioning the surface into regular components, then apply the previous result on each component before using that to deduce our main result. However, we shall be considering a very specific partition known as a triangulation, readers who are familiar with numerical finite element methods would have a good visualisation.

6

Consider a triangulation, see definition (2), T := {Ti}Fi=1 of the surface S, where F  N the number of triangles. For each triangle Ti let the edges be denoted ETi = {eij}3j=1, the exterior angles {ij}3i=1, and

the

parametrisation

of

the

boundary

C([0, Li], Ti)

is

parametrised

by

and

is

then


i

is

such

that

As

we

where the function  is the angle between the vector field u and  , where  : [0, L]  S is positively oriented and parametrises the boundary S. We shall now simplify the sum of the exterior angles, using the following notation:

ES = number of external edges of T ES = number of internal edges of T (ignoring repeated edges). VT = number of external vertices of T . VS = number of vertices of S. VT /S = number of vertices of our triangulation which are not vertices of S. VT = number of internal vertices of T . i,j :=  - ij, the interior angles of the triangle Ti
It is clear that VT /S + VS = VT and that

If a vertex is internal, then the sum of internal angles at that vertex is 2, and if a vertex is external but

not a vertex of S, then the sum of internal angles is . Recall that {k}Vk=S1 is the set of external angles of S, we have that

F3

VS

i,j = 2VT + VT /S + ( - k).

As the boundary curves are closed it is clear that ES = VT , therefore we have ES = 2ES - VT and

hence

5 Oseen-Frank energy rate minimisation
In the previous section we derived a conservation law for vector fields on a surface. We would normally wish to consider the Dirichlet integral of this vector field to find the minimising configurations, however we shall show that if there exists a point with non-zero index then the energy is infinite. Thus we either need to consider systems without defects, or we change our question.
Rather than minimising the Dirichlet integral of the vector field, we can instead minimise the rate at which the Dirichlet integral diverges; since the "minimising" configurations would be the ones which are the slowest to diverge. To derive such a rate we shall require a few additional assumptions on the geometry of our surface.

5.1 Geometry assumptions

We assume that our parameterisation x is such that the vector field F is such that |F|2|x1||x2|  L1(), this is equivalent to saying that F is in the class L2 with respect to curvilinear co-ordinates. This assumption shall play a minor role in the construction of a lower bound. Similarly we recall the definition of the first fundamental forms Lij and assume that

|x1||x2|

2

Lij |xi|

Lij |xi|



L1().

i,j=1

Additionally, for each point ^   we assume there exists a (^) > 0, (^)  [0, ) and h-(^) h+(^) such that

0 < |xi|(^) + h-| - ^| |xi|() |xi|(^) + h+| - ^|,     B(^) \ {^},

(18)

for i = 1, 2. This local H¨older approximation is very important in the derivation of the divergence rate, especially in the case when |x1|(^) = |x2|(^) = 0.

5.2 Vector field assumptions
Similar to the previous section we require some additional assumptions on the vector field u  Atan. A point s is in Ju \ S if and only if x-1(s) / , we formally understand this as "an internal defect of S is an internal defect of ". For a given with discontinuity set Ju  S , which we shall define the constant R > 0 to be

2R :=

inf dist(, x-1(Ju) \ {}) ,

inf

(dist(, )) , min ()

 x-1 (Ju )

 x-1 (Ju \ S )

 x-1 (Ju )

Thus the constant R > 0 is such that for 1, 2  x-1(Ju) distinct, the simple manifolds x(BR(1)  ) and x(BR(2)  ) do not intersect. For < R we define the following domain

 :=  \ B¯ ().
Ju

We consider the one constant approximation to the Oseen-Frank energy, denoted E : Atan  [0, ), on a manifold which is the simplest strain energy [17],

E [u] :=

We shall omit the "x" for tractability as we shall be considering functions of  only.

|u1u2 - u2u1 + F|2

q1|u1u2 - u2u1|2 - q2, q2

q1 |F|2. 1 - q1

In the formulation we assumed that |F|2|x1||x2| is integrable, thus the q2 term is negligible for this analysis. We need to estimate

|u1u2 - u2u1|2|x1||x2| d

 \R

where AR(^) := BR(^) \ B (^) . We shall a lower bound on the local Dirichlet integral of an internal defect and then use that to motivate a similar analysis of a boundary defect. The definition of R is such that Index(u,   Br(^)) is constant for all r R, we denote the index by n(^) := Index(u,   Br(^)), we shall omit ^ during the derivation of the lower bound. Additionally we define the functions m+, m- : Ju  [0, ) by
m+(^) := max{|x1|(^), |x2|(^)}, m-(^) := min{|x1|(^), |x2|(^)},

similarly we shall omit the ^, it is clear by definition that 0 m- m+. We consider two cases, when m+ = 0 and m+ = 0, in this second case we also have that m- = 0.

Lemma 5.

x1 × x2 = 1 xr × x, xr · x = 0, |x1||x2|d = |xr||x|ddr. r

Comparing the above to equation (19) it is clear that we must bound |xr| from below by a function of r only. Reverting back to x1 and x2 we have that

|xr| = r |x1|2 cos2  + |x2|2 sin2  r min |xi|, r  [0, R],   [-, ]

Recall we assumed that x1 and x2 satisfy equation (18) this allows us construct the following bounds

We now consider two cases when m+ > 0 and when m+ = 0, in the latter case by our assumption we have that 0 < h- h+ as otherwise |x1|, |x2| = 0 which implies that x parametrises a point, not a surface. Additionally if  = 0 then that implies that |xi| is constant in BR() and thus h+ = h- = 0 and 0 < m- m+. Consider first case, when m+ > 0 and  > 0 then the integral from equation (25)

5.3 Rate for a boundary defect

Similar to the previous lemma, we shall construct a lower bound on the energy near a defect, however with the inclusion of the boundary changing the geometry and consequently the bound. Similar to the additional assumptions from section 5.1 we require a higher degree of regularity of the boundary. For a given ^  x-1(Ju  S) we shall assume that there exist 1, 2  C1([0, R], R) such that 2(t) > 1(t) for all t  [0, R] and

x (Br(^))  S = C1r  C2r, where Cir := x ^ +

t cos i(t) t sin i(t)

t  [0, r) .

We shall assume that the reciprocal of the difference of the angle functions can be linearised, there exists a constant min < max such that

minr

1 (r) -

1 (0) maxr, for all r  [0, R].

(26)

2 - 1

2 - 1

We understand 2 - 1(0) to be the interior angle of  at the point ^  . We recall that u is the normalisation of a real analytical vector field, this implies that there exists a constant u 0 such that

u1du2 - u2du1
C2r -C1r

ur.

We understand this to be derivative angle between u and e1 is bounded, which implies that the boundary data is such that there are no essential discontinuities [16]. We shall now construct a lower bound on the energy divergence, the majority of the analysis will be similar to the previous lemma.

We observe that the 2nd, 3rd and 4th terms are bounded as  0 because m- m+ and therefore do not contribute towards the divergence, we may apply the same analysis to the 1st term as equation
(22), thus obtaining our result.

6 Prediction of defect strengths

Recall that the energy we wish to consider the limit of the energy

E=

|grad(u)|2 d,

x( )

as  0. However, as we have just proven if there are any defects in the system then the energy diverges to infinity logarithmically. A reader might think that we need only consider systems that lack defects, but we recall the conservation law for defects given in equation (17), which might force the existence of defects depending on the boundary conditions. Minimising an energy which is infinite would have no meaning, however we can minimise the rate at which the energy diverges. We can predict the strengths of defects within a system using only the geometrical parameters. Note that in liquid crystal systems the strengths of defects can are half-integers [6, 13] and as such we extend our notion of defect strength to include such systems.
The edges of the surface may be designed such that they produce a force on the liquid crystal molecules, which influences the orientation of the molecules. There are two ways to model such an influence, the first is called Weak Anchoring, which imposes an energy penalty the further the common axis deviates from the preferred direction. If these forces are sufficiently strong, then we may assume that the vector u has a fixed direction on the boundary [7]. One of the most common boundary conditions is conic boundary conditions where the angle between our vector field u and the tangent to the boundary  (from section 2.2) is constant, with the typical choice being equal to the normal to the edge u = N ×  or purely tangential u =  [12]. Regardless of the specific choice of constant we obtain two important simplifications:

· Boundary defects are given in terms of the exterior angle at that point [11], for a point s  S

with

exterior

angle





(-, )

there

exists

an

integer

m



1 2

Z

such

that

str(u, s)

=

m+

 2

.

Consequently the presence of a vertex implies the existence of a boundary defect.

· The conservation law from section 2.2 is simplified to

Figure 1: An illustration of the optimal defect configuration for a planar triangle.

The function  :   (-, ) is the exterior angle of , not to be confused with  which is the exterior

angle of S. Thus to minimise the rate at which the energy diverges to infinity one needs to minimise

(28) with respect to (27). Recall that the boundary defects can be expressed as a constant plus an integer

which implies that the domain of both our function and constraint are the half-integers.

We can consider a simplification of the above system when S is a planar domain and thus |x1| =

|x2| = 1 and the exterior angle of S is equal to , then our quadratic minimisation problem becomes

A great example of how this principle can be applied is when we consider the square well with nematic

liquid crystals [12], such a system has two steady states the rotational and diagonal state, with no

interior

defects

and

defects

of

{

at

each

of

the

vertices.

The locations of the defects in the

vertices determine what "state" the system is in, but the question of why there are no other families of

solutions can be explained through the above minimisation principle.

Similarly we can predict the families of solutions for any other reasonably smooth system, for example

consider

an

equilateral

triangle,

which

implies

that

N

This piece

has been focused on the Oseen-Frank model on the surface of a manifold. However, similar work has

been conducted on the Landau-de Gennes model in planar polygonal domains. We can compare the

configuration of defects predicted by the derived algorithm against the results that these authors find.

In the case of a equilateral triangular well, the configuration of defects matches precisely the con-

figurations found by Han, Majumdar and Zhang [8] for both the large and small  parameter. In the

context of two dimensional modelling the large  limit of the Landau-de Gennes model corresponds to

the Oseen-Frank one constant approximation.

In the case of an equilateral hexagonal well, the work of Han, Harris, Majumdar and Walton predict

the existence of multiple branches of defect patterns.

These five branches are all predicted by the minimisation method we have described as they all possess

the same energy divergence rate. However, these are not the only branches of defect patterns which are

observed in the Landau-de Gennes model.

is

similar

to

the

because

has a single internal defect of strength +1. This defect pattern is not predicted, as the minimisation

principle considers the sum of the squares of the defect strengths, and the internal defect of +1 has a

larger

rate

of

energy

divergence

than

two

defects

of

strength

.

The transitional states which are denoted T and H, similarly are not observed as, the perspective of

7 Conclusion and Discussion
We derived a conservation law for vector fields on the surface of a manifold using the notions of triangulation and an application of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. We then considered the Oseen-Frank one constant approximation (the Dirichlet integral) on the surface of the manifold and investigated the rate at which the energy density diverges locally because of the defect. Finally, we combined the two results to create a discrete minimisation problem with a linear constraint, the solutions of which predict the strengths of defect branches. Finally, we compared the predictions that this theorem made with results from practical experiments and from numerical simulations.
In future work, the derivation of the generalisation of the Poincar´e­Hopf theorem that we have presented could potentially be generalised further for surfaces which can be described by an atlas of charts, rather than a single one. The proof sketch would involve applying the previous theorem on each chart and then simplifying the sum of angles in a similar method to equation (15).
The prediction theorem we have presented is valid for the Oseen-Frank one constant approximation, which (for thermotropic liquid crystals) is the limit of the Landau-de Gennes model as the temperature decreases [3]. However, we have seen that this heuristic prediction theorem cannot capture certain states. At the present time it is unclear whether this is because the prediction theorem is lacking an important term or if the states are unstable in the low temperature limit.
In this piece we considered the leading order term of the lower bound of the localised Dirichlet integral about each defect, which allowed us to derive a heuristic prediction about the defect strengths. This method predicts the various branches of defects, however it does not give any information about which branch is "preferred". For example, in the shallow rectangular well the diagonal state may energetically preferable to the rotated state [12, 11] depending on the ratio between the lengths of the sides. A potential continuation would be to consider the lower order terms of this energy, this may allow us to heuristically predict the locations of the internal defects and understand which branches are energetically preferable.
Despite the issues we have discussed, the ability to predict potential defect configurations based solely on geometrical parameters could have extensive uses in numerical analysis to construct well posed initial conditions, which are essential in finite element methods. Additionally, the predictive method can be applied to unusual, non-regular, non-polygonal well shapes making it exceptionally versatile. Finally, the algorithm to predict the defect strengths is numerically easy to apply; as it is the discrete minimisation of a quadratic with respect to a linear constraint; where the coefficients are geometrical constants. Such an algorithm is so numerically cheap, the calculations may be done on a smartphone within a few seconds.
