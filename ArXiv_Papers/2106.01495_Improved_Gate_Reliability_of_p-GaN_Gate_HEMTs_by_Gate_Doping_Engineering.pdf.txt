 Abstract--We present a novel p-GaN gate HEMT structure
with reduced hole concentration near the Schottky interface by doping engineering in MOCVD, which aims at lowering the electric field across the gate. By employing an additional unintentionally doped GaN layer, the gate leakage current is suppressed and the gate breakdown voltage is boosted from 10.6 to 14.6 V with negligible influence on the threshold voltage and on-resistance. Time-dependent gate breakdown measurements reveal that the maximum gate drive voltage increases from 6.2 to 10.6 V for a 10-year lifetime with a 1% gate failure rate. This method effectively expands the operating voltage margin of the p-GaN gate HEMTs without any other additional process steps.

I. INTRODUCTION Gallium nitride (GaN) power transistors have drawn increasing attention in high-power, high-efficiency power conversion systems owing to their high breakdown voltage, fast switching speed and low ON-resistance [1-3]. In practical applications, enhancement-mode (E-mode) HEMTs with the normally-off operation are preferred for safety considerations. Among different approaches to realize E-mode HEMTs [4-7], the p-GaN gate AlGaN/GaN HEMT emerged as a leading solution [8, 9]. However, due to the relatively low gate breakdown voltage (BV) (usually 10 - 12 V), the maximum gate operation voltages (VG-max) for p-GaN gate HEMTs are usually between 6 - 8 V [8, 9]. The small gate voltage swings have imposed significant

constraints on the gate driver design and resulted in lifetime reduction. It is highly desired to increase the gate BV and the VG-max for a wider gate drive window.
Several reliability studies focused on the p-GaN gate HEMTs have been carried out over the last few years [10-24]. Different failure mechanisms have been proposed, including: i) metal/p-GaN Schottky junction breakdown, which is widely accepted and most likely to happen prior to others [10-14]; ii) the passivation/p-GaN sidewall related breakdown, which is a bigger problem in self-aligned gate metal/p-GaN structure [15, 16]; and iii) p-GaN/AlGaN/GaN junction breakdown [17, 18]. Many researchers have been tackling the gate breakdown challenge with various methods [19-23]. Zhou et al. [19] and Zhang et al. [20] adopted special treatments in the gate-stacks to enhance the p-GaN/metal Schottky junction, where suppressed gate leakage currents and enhanced gate BV were achieved. An n-GaN/p-GaN/AlGaN/GaN epitaxial structure was proposed for gate reliability enhancement [22], where the Schottky junction was replaced by a metal-n-p junction. However, a high-temperature activation of p-GaN after the gate etching is required, which can be detrimental to the channel due to the strain relaxation of AlGaN [25, 26]. Thus, a technique based on the commonly used p-GaN gate HEMT process would be favored owing to the process simplicity.
In this work, we demonstrated that using an additional unintentionally-doped GaN (u-GaN) layer on top of p-GaN could effectively lower the electric field in the gate and thus enhance the reliability of HEMTs without additional annealing step. This u-GaN/p-GaN gate method neither impairs other electrical characteristics nor requires any extra process steps.
II. DEVICE STRUCTURE AND FABRICATION The p-GaN gate HEMTs were fabricated on 85 nm p-GaN/15-nm Al0.2Ga0.8N/0.7-nm AlN/4.5-m GaN epitaxial structure grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on 2-inch Si (111) substrates from Enkris Semiconductor Inc, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The p-GaN layer was doped with Mg to a concentration of 4 × 1019 cm-3. Three device structure types, named structure A, B and C, have been adopted, as illustrated in Fig. 2(b). They have identical epi-structure and growth conditions except that structure B and structure C have additional epitaxial u-GaN layers on top of the p-GaN grown by MOCVD, which was used to reduce the hole concentration in the region close to the Schottky interface with

the metal, thus widening the depletion region and reducing the

maximum electric field in the GaN gate. The thicknesses of

u-GaN were 20 and 30 nm for structure B and C, respectively.

Due to the memory effect and diffusion of Mg, the u-GaN

layers should be slightly p-type doping after processing [27].

The fabrication process started with a gate definition by a

Cl-based plasma etch. Devices with structure A, B and C have

an identical fabrication process except that B and C have longer

GaN etching times. Thanks to the high-selectivity and low

etching rate of the etching recipe, a smooth AlGaN surface with

low etching damages has been obtained for all three structures

(Fig. 2(b)). After the gate contact window opening, a

Schottky-type contact was formed between the Ti/Au and the

GaN gate. The devices tested feature a gate width (WG) of 100

m, a gate length (LG) of 5 m, a gate-source distance (LGS) of 5

m, and a gate-drain distance (LGD) of 15 m. The relatively

longer LGS compared to literature is to suppress the gate

breakdown induced by the passivation/p-GaN sidewall [12, 15].

On-wafer characterizations were performed by a Keithley 4200

analyzer.

III. DEVICE CHARACTERIZATIONS A. Static Performance and Temperature Dependence
Fig. 2(a) depicts the transfer characteristics of the devices with structure A, B, and C. All devices exhibit a VTH of ~ 2.1 V (defined at ID = 0.01 mA/mm), and an ON/OFF ratio larger than 108. Fig. 2(b) and (c) show the output characteristic of devices with structure A and C, in both of which a RON of 22 ·mm is obtained. These results show that the doping engineering has a negligible effect on the conduction characteristics (e.g., RON and VTH), consistent with [12, 20]. Meanwhile, a clear impact can be observed on the gate leakage characteristics as shown in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 3(a). Under a forward bias, the gate leakage

current is dominant by the metal/GaN Schottky junction [12]. Owing to the reduced acceptor doping concentration in u-GaN, structure B and C show lower gate leakage under forward bias.
Fig. 3(a) compares the forward gate breakdown characteristics of A, B and C measured at 25 oC. The breakdown mechanism was determined to be Schottky junction failure [14]. Compared to A, the additional u-GaN layer in B has effectively boosted the BV from 10.9 V to 13.2 V. For C with a thicker u-GaN layer, the gate BV further reached 14.6 V. By introducing the u-GaN layer between the p-GaN and metal, the hole concentration close to the Schottky junction can be effectively decreased, which promotes a wider depletion region when a positive bias is applied. Thus, the peak electric field is lowered and the gate BV is significantly enlarged. Tallarico et al. have adopted a similar strategy by Mg doping compensation in [12]. However, no significant gate BV increase has been observed in their work. This difference can be attributed to their short LGS and self-aligned metal/p-GaN architecture, which makes the p-GaN sidewall vulnerable [14-16].
Fig. 3(b) shows the statistical summary of the gate BVs of structure A, B and C at 25 oC, 100 oC and 150 oC. For each temperature, at least fifteen devices were measured for each structure. All the gate BVs of the three structures show weak dependences on the temperature. These results demonstrate that the doping engineering can effectively suppress the gate leakage current and boost the gate BV without impacting the threshold voltage or any additional fabrication process.
B. TDGB Analysis
Time-dependent gate breakdown (TDGB) tests with constant voltage stresses were performed to evaluate the gate reliability of the samples with structure A (Fig. 4) and C (Fig. 5). A constant voltage is applied on the gate with VDS = 0 V at room

temperature. The time-to-breakdown (tBD) is defined as when the gate leakage shows a sudden increase. For each structure, three different VGS were adopted (10 V, 10.2 V, 10.4 V for structure A, and 12.8 V, 13 V, 13.2 V for structure C). tBD distribution can be described by the Weibull statistics. The shape factor  extracted from structure A is 0.74 - 0.82, whereas it is 0.76 - 0.87 from structure C. The comparable  values indicate a similar degradation mechanism.
The lifetime prediction was performed using the most conservative exponential law (i.e., linear fitting of the ln(tBD)-VGS relationship), as shown in Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 5(b). Considering a 10-year lifetime at a failure level of 1%, the VG-max is determined to be 6.2 V for structure A. Meanwhile, a much higher VG-max of 10.6 V has been achieved in structure C. The increased applicable gate voltage range offers more gate driver design flexibility and robust gate reliability.
Fig. 6 plots VG-max and the corresponding VTH observed in the p-GaN gate HEMTs in this work and other p-GaN gate HEMTs in literature [10, 15-17, 22, 24]. A high VTH and large VG-max are particularly desired in p-GaN gate HEMTs. The VG-max values are extracted by the exponential law for a 10-year lifetime at a failure rate of either 1% or 63%. Structure C demonstrates the largest VG-max.

IV. CONCLUSION In this work, a novel p-GaN gate HEMT structure with doping engineering was proposed and investigated. By growing an additional u-GaN layer on top of the p-GaN, more robust and reliable devices with lower gate leakage currents, higher gate BV (14.6 V), larger VG-max (10.6 V) were obtained, with negligible impacts on the the VTH, RON and sub-threshold slopes.

Moreover, this technique requires no additional process step after the MOCVD growth. The proposed u-GaN/p-GaN structure is highly effective in improving the p-GaN gate HEMT reliability for high-efficiency power conversion systems.
