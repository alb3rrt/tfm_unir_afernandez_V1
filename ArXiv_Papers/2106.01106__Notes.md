## Abstract

We are interested in solutions of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NLKG) in $\mathbb{R}^{1+d}$, $d\ge1$, which behave as a soliton or a sum of solitons in large time. In the spirit of other articles focusing on the supercritical generalized Korteweg-de Vries equations and on the nonlinear Schr{รถ}dinger equations, we obtain an $N$-parameter family of solutions of (NLKG) which converges exponentially fast to a sum of given (unstable) solitons. For $N = 1$, this family completely describes the set of solutions converging to the soliton considered; for $N\ge 2$, we prove uniqueness in a class with explicit algebraic rate of convergence.
