Abstract The middle graph M (G) of a graph G is the graph obtained by subdividing each edge of G exactly once and joining all these newly introduced vertices of adjacent edges of G. A perfect Roman dominating function on a graph G is a function f : V (G)  {0, 1, 2} satisfying the condition that every vertex v with f (v) = 0 is adjacent to exactly one vertex u for which f (u) = 2. The weight of a perfect Roman dominating function f is the sum of weights of vertices. The perfect Roman domination number is the minimum weight of a perfect Roman dominating function on G. In this paper, we give a characterization of middle graphs with equal Roman domination and perfect Roman domination numbers.

1. Introduction

Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph with the vertex set V = V (G) and edge set E = E(G). The order of G is defined as

the cardinality of V . The open neighborhood of v  V (G) is the set N (v) = {u  V (G) | uv  E(G)}. In [4], Hamada and

Yoshimura defined the middle graph of a graph. The middle graph M (G) of a graph G is the graph obtained by subdividing

each edge of G exactly once and joining all these newly introduced vertices of adjacent edges of G. The precise definition

of M (G) is as follows. The vertex set V (M (G)) is V (G)  E(G). Two vertices v, w  V (M (G)) are adjacent in M (G) if (i)

v, w  E(G) and v, w are adjacent in G or (ii) v  V (G), w  E(G) and v, w are incident in G.

The study of Roman domination was motivated by the defense strategies used to defend the Roman Empire during

the reign of Emperor Constantine the Great, 274­337 AD. The concept of Roman domination was introduced in [2, 8, 9].

A function f : V (G)  {0, 1, 2} is a Roman dominating function on G if every vertex v  V (G) for which f (v) = 0 is

adjacent to at least one vertex u  V (G) for which f (u) = 2. The weight of a Roman dominating function is the value

(f ) := vV (G) f (v). The Roman domination number R(G) is the minimum weight of a Roman dominating function on G. As a variant of Roman domination, a function f : V (G)  {0, 1, 2} is a perfect Roman dominating function on G if

every vertex v  V (G) for which f (v) = 0 is adjacent to exactly one vertex u  V (G) for which f (u) = 2. Similarly, perfect

Roman domination number pR(G) is defined. In [5], Henning et al. introduced the notion of perfect Roman domination

and

showed

that

if

T

is

a

on

vertices,

then

pR(T )

n.

In

[3],

Darkooti

et

al.

proved

that

it

is

NP-complete

to

decide whether a graph has a perfect Roman dominating function, even if the graph is bipartite. This suggests determining

the exact value of perfect Roman domination numbers for special classes of graphs. Recently, Kim proved the following

result.

Theorem 1.1 ( [6]). Let G be a graph of order n. Then R(M (G)) = n.

Based on this result, we characterize all graphs G such that R(M (G)) = pR(M (G)). We try to determine the exact value of perfect Roman domination numbers in middle graphs of special classes of graphs.

2. Main Results
In this section, we introduce the concept of a middle Roman dominating function to study the Roman domination number of the middle graph M (G) for a given graph G. A middle Roman dominating function (MRDF) on a graph G is a function f : V  E  {0, 1, 2} satisfying the following conditions: (i) every element x  V for which f (x) = 0 is incident to at least one element y  E for which f (y) = 2, (ii) every element x  E for which f (x) = 0 is adjacent or incident to at least one element y  V  E for which f (y) = 2. A MRDF f gives an ordered partition (V0  E0, V1  E1, V2  E2) (or (V0f  E0f , V1f  E1f , V2f  E2f ) to refer to f ) of V  E, where Vi := {x  V | f (x) = i} and Ei := {x  E | f (x) = i}. The weight of a middle Roman dominating function f is xV E f (x). The middle Roman domination number R (G) of G is the minimum weight of a middle Roman dominating function of G. A R (G)-function is a MRDF on G with weight R (G). Similarly, we can define a perfect middle Roman dominating function (PMRDF) and related definitions. For a subset S of G, the subgraph obtained from G by deleting all vertices in S and all edges incident with S is denoted by G - S.

Proposition 2.1 ( [10]). Let G be a graph with components G1, . . . , Gt. Then pR(G) =

t i=1

pR(Gi).

The following is our main theorem.

Theorem 2.1. Let G be a graph. Then R (G) = pR(G) if and only if there exists a R (G)-function such that (i) vertices incident to edges in E2 are adjacent to vertices in V1 and (ii) G - {u, v  V (G) | uv  E2} is an empty graph.

Proof. If G is an empty graph, then the statement holds. By Proposition 2.1, from now on we assume that G is connected and not empty.
(): Let f = (V0  E0, V1  E1, V2  E2) be a R (G)-function such that R (G) = pR(G). We proceed by proving six claims.
Claim 1. V2 = . Suppose that there exists v  V2. Consider G - {v}. Define g : V (G - {v})  E(G - {v})  {0, 1, 2} by g(u) = min{f (u) + f (uv), 2} for each u  N (v) and g(x) = f (x) otherwise. Then g is a MRDF on G - {v} with (g) = n - 2. Since G - {v} has order n - 1, by Theorem 1.1 (g)  R (G - {v}) = n - 1, a contradiction.
Claim 2. E1 = . Suppose that there exists e  E1. Let u and v be vertices incident to e. We divides the following three cases depending on the values of u and v assigned under f .
Case 1. u, v  V0. There exist e1, e2  E2 such that u, v are incident to e1, e2, respectively. Also, there exist u, v  V (G) such that u, v are incident to e1, e2, respectively. Consider G - {u, u, v, v}. Define g : V (G - {u, u, v, v})  E(G - {u, u, v, v})  {0, 1, 2} by g(x) = f (x). Since there is no edge in E2 adjacent to e1 or e2, g is a MRDF on G - {u, u, v, v}. Then g is a MRDF with (g)  n - 5. Since G - {u, u, v, v} has order n - 4, by Theorem 1.1 (g)  R (G - {u, u, v, v}) = n - 4, a contradiction.
Case 2. u  V0, v  V1 or v  V0, u  V1. By symmetry, assume that u  V0 and v  V1. There exists e1  E2 incident to u. Also, there exist u  V (G) incident to e1. Consider G - {u, u, v}. Define g : V (G - {u, u, v})  E(G - {u, u, v})  {0, 1, 2} by g(x) = min{f (x) + f (xv), 2} for each x  N (v) \ {u} and g(x) = f (x) otherwise. Then g is a MRDF with (g)  n - 4. Since G - {u, u, v} has order n - 3, by Theorem 1.1 (g)  R (G - {u, u, v}) = n - 3, a contradiction.
Case 3. u, v  V1. Consider G-{u, v}. Define g : V (G-{u, v})E(G-{u, v})  {0, 1, 2} by g(x) = min{f (x)+f (xu), 2} for each x  N (u) \ {v}, g(x) = min{f (x) + f (xv), 2} for each x  N (v) \ {u} and g(x) = f (x) otherwise. Then g is a MRDF with (g)  n - 3. Since G - {u, v} has order n - 2, by Theorem 1.1 (g)  R (G - {u, v}) = n - 2, a contradiction.
Claim 3. Every edge in E2 is incident to vertices in V0. Let e  E2 and e = uv. Suppose that u  V0 or v  V0. Consider G - {u, v}. Define g : V (G - {u, v})  E(G - {u, v})  {0, 1, 2} by g(x) = min{f (x) + f (xu), 2} for each x  N (u) \ {v}, g(x) = min{f (x) + f (xv), 2} for each x  N (v) \ {u} and g(x) = f (x) otherwise. Then g is a MRDF with (g)  n - 3. Since G - {u, v} has order n - 2, by Theorem 1.1 (g)  R (G - {u, v}) = n - 2, a contradiction.
Claim 4. Every edge in E2 is adjacent to edges in E0. By Claims 2, 3 and the hypothesis that f is a PMRDF, Claim 4 follows.

Claim 5. Vertices incident to edges in E2 are adjacent to vertices in V1. Let uv = e  E2. Suppose that u is adjacent to w  V0. Then w must be incident to some e  E2. Since uw  E0 is adjacent to e, this is a contradiction.
Claim 6. G - {u, v  V (G) | uv  E2} is an empty graph. If H := G - {u, v  V (G) | uv  E2} is not empty, then every edge of H must be assigned 1 under f . The weight of f is not equal to the order G, a contradiction.

(): The conditions (i) and (ii) imply that the R (G)-function is a PMRDF on G.

Based on Theorem 2.1, we determine the exact values of perfect Roman domination numbers for middle graphs of paths and cycles.

Proposition 2.2. For a path Pn of order n, pR(Pn) = n

Proof. Let Pn = v1v2 . . . vn. Clearly pR(P2) = 2. For n  3, we divides the following three cases.

Case

1.

n



0

(mod

3).

Define

f

:

V (Pn)  E(Pn)



{0, 1, 2}

by

f (v3i+1)

=

1,

f (v3i+2v3i+3)

=

2

for

0i



n-3 3

and

f (x) = 0 otherwise.

2

Case 2.

n  1 (mod 3).

Define f

: V (Pn)  E(Pn)  {0, 1, 2} by f (v3i+1) = 1, f (v3i+2v3i+3) = 2 for 0  i 

n-4 3

,

f (vn) = 1 and f (x) = 0 otherwise.

Case 3.

n  2 (mod 3).

Define f

: V (Pn)  E(Pn)  {0, 1, 2} by f (v3i+1v3i+2) = 2, f (v3i+3) = 1 for 0  i 

n-5 3

,

f (vn-1vn) = 2 and f (x) = 0 otherwise.

In any case, it is easy to see that f is a PMRDF with the weight n. This completes the proof.

Proposition 2.3. For a cycle Cn of order n, pR(Cn) = n if n  0 (mod 3), n + 1 otherwise.
Proof. Let Cn = v1v2 . . . vnv1, and let f be a pR(Cn)-function. Suppose that (f ) < |V (Cn)  E(Cn)|. Then there exists an element x  V (Cn)  E(Cn) such that f (x) = 2. Without loss of generality, we assume that f (vn-1vn) = 2. Consider Cn - {vn-1, vn} = Pn-2. If R (Cn) = pR(Cn), then it follows from Theorem 2.1 that we have f (v1) = f (vn-2) = 1.
If n - 2  1 (mod 3), then by the Case 2 of Proposition 2.2 Pn-2 has a PMRDF g such that g(v1) = g(vn-2) = 1 and pR(Pn-2) = n - 2. This implies that pR(Cn) = n.
If n - 2  1 (mod 3), then Theorem 2.1 implies that pR(Cn) > R (Cn). Now we can define a PMRDF f with the weight n + 1 by giving f (v1vn) = 1 in the Cases 2 and 3 of Proposition 2.2. Thus, pR(Cn) = n + 1.

Finally, we conclude our paper by suggesting the following problems.

Problem 2.1. For a complete bipartite graph Km,n, what is the exact value of pR(Km,n)? Problem 2.2. For a complete graph Kn, what is the exact value of pR(Kn)?
