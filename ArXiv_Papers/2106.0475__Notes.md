## Abstract

Finally, we demonstrate that there are two non-degenerate domain wall solutions for any given parameter set. These are distinguished by either clockwise or anti-clockwise interpolation of the inter-component phase difference, each producing a different solution for the other fields. However, only domain wall solutions in $s+id$ systems exhibit magnetic field twisting.
