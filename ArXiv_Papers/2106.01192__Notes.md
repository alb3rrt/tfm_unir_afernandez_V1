## Abstract

Motivated by twisted graphene multilayers, we study interaction of a Chern insulator with circularly polarized light. We find that the interaction energy contains an antisymmetric term that couples to the helicity of incident light, $\mathbf h={\rm Im}{[\mathbf E(\omega)\times\mathbf E^*(\omega)]}$. For a two-band Chern insulator, this term is expressed as an integral involving the Berry curvature of the system. Taking advantage of this coupling energy, we propose an experimental protocol for switching topological memory based on orbital magnetization of a Chern insulator by circularly polarized light.
