Abstract
In this work we study and establish some quenched functional central limit theorems (CLT) for stationary random fields under a projective criteria. These results are functional generalizations of the theorems obtained by Zhang et al. [35] who themselves extended the quenched functional CLT for ortho-martingales established by Peligrad and Volny´ [28] to random fields satisfying a Hannan type projective condition. In the work of Zhang et al. [35], the authors have already proven a quenched functional CLT however the assumptions were not optimal (as they require the existence of a 2 + -moment). In this article, we establish the results under weaker assumptions, namely we only require a Orlicz space condition to hold.
1 Introduction
Developments within the Markovian theory led to the question of the conditions under which a central limit theorem could be derived for Markov chains; in particular what restrictions were sufficient on the initial distribution and the transition operator to have this kind of result. Seminal results were obtained by Gordin and Lifsic [14] (see also Borodin and Ibragimov [2] or Derriennic and Lin [11]) for Markov chains endowed with the stationary measure as their initial distribution as well as Kipnis and Varadhan [19] (see also Derriennic and Lin [11]) for additive functionals of reversible Markov chains. Additionally Derriennic and Lin [11] also obtained a CLT for Markov chains starting from a fixed point (in other words endowed with x the Dirac measure in the state x as their initial distribution). This kind of theorems are called quenched CLT. Another way of representing these results is to consider a fixed past and to study the convergence in distribution with respect to that past. The difficulties during the proof arise from the fact that this fixed past causes the process to not be stationary anymore. An extensive literature exists on the subject, one can cite the following works by Barrera et al. [1], Cuny and Peligrad [4], Cuny and Merlev`ede [5], Cuny and Vony´ [7], Dedecker et al. [10], Peligrad [26] and Volny´ and Woodroofe [34]. Note that some counter examples to quenched central limit theorems under specific conditions were found by Ouchti and Volny´ [25] and Volny´ and Woodroofe [33]. Functional versions of these quenched central limit theorems, also called quenched weak invariance principles, have also been the subject of numerous research articles such as the ones by Barrera et al. [1], Cuny and Merlev`ede [5], Cuny and Volny´ [7] and Peligrad [26].
Random fields naturally appear as a generalization of sequences of random variables, however extending the one-dimensional results to greater dimension is much harder than one would think. The first problem we are faced with is to correctly define the notion of past. The approach we have implemented in this paper is to use the notion of commuting filtrations. In particular, this property is satisfied by filtrations generated by fields of independent random variables or even by fields with independent columns (or equivalently independent rows). As a lot of process can be expressed as a functional of i.i.d. random variables, these type of filtrations are quite common and merit interest. A lot of work has been done under commuting filtrations (see Volny´ [30] and Cuny et al. [6]).

As usual we will require some kind of dependency condition on the field studied. Namely, in this paper, we will use Hannan's projective condition [17]. The problem we are interested in has been studied by Cuny and Volny´ [7] for time series but it has yet to be investigated for higher dimensions which is the purpose of this article. Though the problem we focus on hasn't been studied yet, one can note that fields satisfying Hannan's condition have been quite extensively studied and numerous CLTs and functional CLTs (both annealed and quenched) have been obtained. One could refer to the following: Volny´ and Wang [32], Klicnarov´a et al. [23] and Zhang et al. [35].
The proof of the main theorem in this paper is based upon the use of a martingale-coboundary decomposition that can be found in [32] (some more recent and general results can be found in [12, 31, 13], see also [15]) as well as the central limit theorem and the weak invariance principle established by Peligrad and Volny´ [28] for ortho-martingales. Once the main theorems are established, we derive corollaries in the spirit of the results obtained by Zhang et al. [35]. As shown by the previous results in the literature, it will be required to address two situations separately : first when the summations are done over cubic regions of Zd and, after that, when the regions are only required to be rectangular.
This paper will be structured as follows: in Section 2, we present our results, the notations used throughout our article and the main results obtained in this work. In particular, we will split the results into two categories; those who deal with summations over cubic regions only and those who deals with more general rectangular regions. The proofs of these theorems will appear in Section 3 and in Section 4 we improve on the two applications studied by Zhang et al. [35]. These two examples concern the linear and Volterra random fields satisfying Hannan's condition. They are a common occurrence in the field of financial mathematics and economics.

2 Framework and results

In all that follows, we consider a probability space (, F, P) and all the random variables considered

thereafter will be real-valued and defined on that probability space. We start by introducing multiple

notations that will be used throughout this article: d will be an integer greater than 1, bold characters

will designate multi-indexes, denote n := (n1, . . . , nd) and |n| :=

d i=1

ni

for

any

n



Zd.

The

set

of

integers {1, . . . , d} will be denoted by 1, d . In order to define the concept of past trajectory, it is

necessary to define an order on Zd: if u, v  Zd are multi-indexes such that for all k  1, d , uk  vk, then we will write u  v.

Convergence of fields indexed by Zd will be interpreted in the following sense. If n = (n1, . . . , nd) is a multi-index, then the notation n   is to be interpreted as the convergence of min{n1, . . . , nd} to .

Before introducing the field we are interested in, we define some transformations on . We let Ti :   , i  {1, . . . , d} be invertible measure-preserving commuting transforms on the probability space (, F, P) and we make use of the operators notation (i.e. if U and V are two transformations on , we denote U V := U  V ).

We consider a sigma-field F0  F such that F0  T -iF0 and a random variable X0  L02 where

L02 = L02(, F0, P) is the set of all F0-measurable square integrable centered random variables.

For every n = (n1, . . . , nd)  Zd, set

Xn = X0  T n,

(1)

and

Fn = T -nF0,

(2)

where T n = T1n1 · · · Tdnd. As a result Xn is Fn-measurable.

Suppose that the family (Fk)kZd is a commuting filtration, that is, for every integrable random

2

variable X, it holds

Ei [Ej [X]] = Eij [X] ,

where Ei [X] = E [ X| Fi] and i  j is the coordinate-wise minimum between i and j.

We recall the notion of ortho-martingale which were introduced by Cairoli [3] (see also Khoshnevisan

[20]). We say that a random field (Di)iZd is an ortho-martingale difference field if it is integrable

and satisfies the equation Ea[Dn] = 0 as long as there exists an integer k  1, d such that ak < bk.

Then, if Mn :=

n u=0

Du

the

random

field

(Mn)nNd

will

be

called

an

ortho-martingale.

Suppose also that the random variable X0 is regular with respect to the filtration F, that is E [X0 |F-ei ] = 0 for every i  {1, · · · , d}, where ei is the multi-index whose i-th coordinate is equal to 1 and the others are equal to 0 and using the convention that  × 0 = 0.

Following the work of Krasnosel'skii and Rutitskii [21], we define the Luxemburg norm associated to the Young function  : R+ \ {0}  R+ \ {0} as

f  = inf{t > 0 : E [ (|f |/t)]  1}.

In everything that follows, we will consider the Young function  : R+ \ {0}  R+ \ {0} defined for

every x  R+ \ {0} by

(x) = x2(log(1 + |x|))d-1.

(3)

We consider the projection operators defined, for any n  Zd, by Pn =

d i=1

(En

-

En-ei

).

For

every   , we denote by P a regular version of the conditional probability given F0, that is

P = P ( ·| F0) ().

Finally we introduce the sum that we will be studying, for every n  (N)d,

n
Sn = Xi,
i=1

and we also set

S¯n = Sn - Rn where

d

Rn = (-1)i-1

En(j1,··· ,jd) [Sn] ,

i=1

1j1<···<jid

where n(j1,··· ,jd) is the multi-index obtained by replacing with 0 all the j1, · · · , ji-th coordinates of the multi-index n and leaving the rest unchanged.

In dimension d = 1, this reduces to the following expression: S¯n = Sn - E [Sn|F0] , for n  N.
This case was investigated by Cuny and Volny´ in [7] and therefore, we will always consider d > 1 in the rest of the paper. In dimension d = 2, the definition of S¯n reduces down to
S¯n,m = Sn,m - E [Sn,m|Fn,0] - E [Sn,m|F0,m] + E [Sn,m|F0,0] , for (n, m)  (N)2.

2.1 Functional CLT over squares
Here we present the quenched functional CLT over cubic regions of Zd. These results expand to the functional framework Theorem 4.1, the second part of Corollary 4.3 and Theorem 4.4 (a) obtained in [35]. It is also possible to view these results as an extension to higher dimensions of Theorem 1 established by Cuny and Volny´ in [7]. As noted in [35], the proof of these theorems essentially reduce down to a particular case of the proof of the functional central limit theorems over rectangular regions of Zd. The differences in the proofs between the two frameworks will be specified in greater details in Section 3.

In Theorem 2.1 the random centering Rn,n cannot be avoided without additional hypothesis. As a matter of fact, for d = 1, Volny´ and Woodroofe [33] constructed an example showing that the CLT for partial sums needs not be quenched. It should also be noticed that, for a stationary ortho-martingale, the existence of a finite second moment is not enough for the validity of a quenched CLT when the summation is taken over rectangles (see Peligrad and Volny´ [28]). That being said, the following corollary gives a sufficient condition to get rid of the stochastic centering Rn in the previous theorem.

To end this section, we give a condition that is easier to verify but still guarantees that the convergence (5) holds.

Then, for almost all   , the conclusion of Corollary 2.2 holds.

Once again we note that this result is an extension of Corollary 2 in [7] to random fields and an extension to the functional framework of Theorem 2.6 (a) found in [35].

2.2 Functional CLT over rectangles
In order to obtain a functional CLT when we sum over rectangles, a stronger projective condition than (4) is necessary. Indeed Peligrad and Volny´ [28] have given a counter example to a quenched CLT over rectangles for some stationary ortho-martingale. This leads us to consider a stronger projective condition.

This last Theorem not only extend Theorem 4.4 (b) in [35] to the functional case but also reduces the required condition even in the classical CLT case.

3 Proofs of the results

Before we prove the previous results, we start by defining some additional notations: · if h :   R is a measurable function, we will denote by hu, u  Zd, the function h  T u; · for any n  (N)d and for any measurable function h :   R, we denote

Sn(h) =

hi,

1in

and

S¯n(h) = Sn(h) - Rn(h) where

d

Rn(h) = (-1)i-1

En(j1,··· ,ji) [Sn(h)] ,

i=1

1j1<···<jid

and n(j1,··· ,ji) is the multi-index whose j1, · · · , ji-th coordinates are 0 and the others are equal to the corresponding coordinates of n;

· for any i  1, d and for any   N, we denote

F(i) =

Fk;

kZd, kil

· we set L2 lnd-1 L(G) to be the set of G-measurable functions h : R  R such that E h2 max(0, ln(|h|))d-1 < ; if G = F , we simply write L2 lnd-1 L(F ) = L2 lnd-1 L;

h  L2 lnd-1 L,

Let us start with the proof of Theorem 2.4 as it is the most general result. Moreover the computations used in the proof of Theorem 2.1 are a particular case of the computations for the proof of Theorem 2.4 and will be largely skipped.

The proof of Theorem 2.4 relies on the following important lemma which we will refer to as the main lemma in the rest of the paper
Lemma 3.1 For any function h  L2 lnd-1 L, F0-measurable and satisfying the following condition:

P0(hu)  < ,

In order to establish this lemma, we shall first obtain this intermediary lemma.

|P0(hu)|2   C P0(hu)  .

Proof of Lemma 3.2. Let h  L lnd-1 L, u  Zd and t > P0(hu) . We let
t =    : 4 (P0(hu))2 () > t2 .

According to Corollary 1.7 of Chapter 6 in Krengel [22], there exists a constant Cd > 0 such that

Proof of the main lemma. We consider a measurable function h satisfying the hypothesis of the lemma and we let n, N  (N)d such that n  N . Then, we start by studying the quantity S¯n(h) using the following projective decomposition (see [27]):

Remark that the proof of Proposition 4.1 in [32] can be easily adapted to the case of Orlicz spaces such that for some fixed n  N, we get the following martingale-codoundary decomposition

We conclude by noticing that the field (D0  T i)iZd satisfies a functional central limit theorem (according to Theorem 5 in [28]) and therefore the expected result is obtained by applying Theorem 3.1
in [24].

Proof of the Theorem 2.1. The proof of this theorem is very similar to the previous one, with the

The terms satisfying i = 1 have this property according to the hypothesis of the corollary and all the other terms are treated in a similar fashion. By induction, the corollary will be proven if we can show that the if property (16) is verified for all j1 < · · · < ji, it also holds true for all j1 < · · · < ji+1. For the sake of simplicity and without loss of generality, we will only establish that

j  1, d , P (j) = P (1, 2).

In other words, we use the hypothesis of the corollary to show

According to Jensen's inequality we have

E0[1miaxn(Ei(1,2) [Si])2] = E0[1miaxn(Ei(1,2) [Ei(1) [Si]])2]  E0[1miaxn(Ei(1) [Si])2].

So

Before continuing with the proof, we establish Lemma 3.3.

In order to do so, we use an induction on k = d - i. For k = 0 and in the same way as in the proof of Lemma 3.2 in [35], we establish that

Hence

Now, we suppose that the desired property holds true for k - 1 < d - 1. Without loss of generality, we establish the property only for (j1, . . . , jn) = (1, . . . , n); it is enough to show that

Theorems 2.6 and 2.3 are direct consequences of this lemma and the previous results. Proof of Theorem 2.6. This theorem is a consequence of Lemma 3.3 and of Theorem 2.5.

Proof of Theorem 2.3. The theorem is a consequence of Lemma 3.3, (47) in [35] (for q = 2; and the proof of Theorem 4.2 and Lemma 3.3 in [35]) and Theorem 2.1.

The rest of this section will be dedicated to proving Theorem 2.7. We start by making a few remarks concerning the Luxemburg norms. Let us note that for x  0 and 0 <   e - 1,

ln

x 

ln(1 + )  ln(1 + x).

Recall that the function  : R+ \ {0}  R+ \ {0} is defined by

(x) = x2(ln(1 + |x|))d-1

for all x  R+ \ {0}. Then, we deduce the following remarkable property of the function . For x > 0 and 0 <   e - 1,

for x  0 and  > 1.

Obviously the function  defined by (3) is bijective and we denote by -1 its inverse function. The following lemma might be well-known but we could not find it in the literature.

Lemma 3.6 Let X  L2 lnd-1 L. If -1 (E [(X)])  e - 1, then

and if E[(X)] > 1, then

X   -1 (E[(X)]) , X   E [(X)] .

Proof of Lemma 3.6. If X = 0 almost surely, then the property is evident. Else, suppose that P(X = 0) = 1, then by the definition of Luxembourg norm

X  = inf

>0:E 

X 

1 .

Note that by the properties of  for any 0 <   e - 1

E

.

From this inequality it follows that if  is the solution to the equation E [(X)] = () we have

necessarily that E



X

For the case E [(X)] > 1, the proof is similar using property (18) of .

Lemma 3.7 Condition (8) implies u0 P0(Xu)  < .

Proof. Let a, b  Zd such that a  b. Denote by  the conjuguate function associated with  defined in the following way
(x) = sup(xy - (y))

for x  R+ \ {0}. By the generalized Holder inequality for Orlicz spaces (see [29], p.58) we have

We have that

inf  > 0 :





v=2n

where 2-n = (2n1 · · · 2nd )-1. It is enough to establish the result in the case E 

P-v (X0) 

 (e-1)

for any v  0, as the other case can be proved using similar arguments and is left to the reader.

By Lemma 3.6 above, if E 

P-v (X0) 

 (e - 1) for a v  0, we also have



P-v(X0)  

E 

P-v (X0 )

So

P-v(X0)

Also by convexity and the Jensen inequality as well as the definition of  it follows that

Since E-n[X0]  is nonincreasing in all directions of n, we obtain that for any n such that nk > 0 for all k  1, d , we have

2n -1(2n)

E-2n [X0]  

2n -1

E0[Xu]  -1(|u|)

u=2n-1

So, for some positive constant K

However, there exits a constant K > 0 such that -1(2n)  2n-1(2-n)K. Hence, according to

the previous inequalities, we have shown that (8) implies

P0(Xu)  < .
u1
In the same way, we have for every i  1, d and for every (j1, . . . , ji)  1, d i such that j1 < · · · < ji,
P0(Xu(j1,...,ji) )  < .
u(j1 ,...,ji ) 1(j1 ,...,ji )
Hence (2.4) is fullfilled.

Proof of Theorem 2.7. This theorem is a consequence of Theorem 2.4 and Lemmas 3.3 and 3.7.

4 Examples
In this section, we present two examples of application of the previous results we obtained. We will focus on both a linear and a non-linear example. We improve on the results by Zhang et al. [35] by requiring weaker assumptions on both the moment of the innovations and the coefficients which appear in each example. More precisely, we obtain a functional CLT despite only requiring that the i.i.d. innovations belongs to the Orlicz space L2 lnd-1 L instead of the Lebesgue space Lq with q > 2 as is required by Zhang et al. [35]. Throughout this section, as before, we denote by C > 0 a generic constant, which may be different from line to line. Recall that the function  : R+ \ {0}  R+ \ {0} is bijective and defined by (3).
Example 4.1 (Linear field) Let (n)nZd be a random field of independent, identically distributed random variables, which are centered and satisfy E |0|2 (log(1 + |0|))d-1 < . For k  0 define

Xk = aj k-j .
j0

Assume that the following condition hold.

1 -1(|k|)
k1

a2j
jk-1

1 2
< .

(19)

Then the quenched functional CLT in Corollary 2.5 holds.

Remark 4.2 Condition (19) is fulfilled whenever the stronger but more practical condition

(log(|k|))1/2 k1 |k|1/2

a2j
jk-1

1 2
<

is satisfied.

The results obtained by Zhang et al. [35] (Remark 6.2 (c)) required the existence of q-th moment, with q > 2, of the innovation 0 to obtain the quenched functional CLT;, meanwhile, we only require that 0 satisfy a weaker Orlicz condition to obtain that result. Additionally we require weaker assumptions on the coefficients au, u  Zd. Proof of Example 4.1. According to the independence of n, we have

E1 [Xu] =

aj k-j .

ju-1

Then, applying the Burkholder inequality for Orlicz spaces (see Meyer and Dellacherie [8], p.304, VII - 92), we obtain

E1 [Xu]  =

aj k-j

ju-1

 C

a2j

k-j

ju-1

By stationarity and since 0  < , we obtain, by using assumption (19), that condition (8) is satisfied. Hence the result.

15

Example 4.3 (Volterra field) Let (n)nZd be a random field of independent, identically distributed, and centered random variables satisfying E |0|2 (log(1 + |0|))d-1 < . For k  0, define

Xk =

au,v k-uk-v .

(u,v)(0,0)

where au,v are real coefficients with au,u = 0 and u,v0 a2u,v < . In addition, assume that it holds that

1 -1(|k|)
k1

a2u,v
(u,v)(k-1,k-1) u=v

1/2
< ,

(20)

Then the quenched functional CLT in Theorem 2.5 holds.

Remark 4.4 In the same manner as before, we notice that (20) is satisfied whenever

(log(|k|))1/2 k1 |k|1/2

a2u,v
(u,v)(k-1,k-1) u=v

1/2
< .

This is a generalization of the quenched functional CLT obtained in [35] (Example 6.3). Here, we only require an Orlicz space type condition on the innovation 0 and we weaken the condition (54) in Zhang et al. [35] to condition (20).

Proof. Note that

E1 [Xk] =

au,v k-uk-v

u,vk-1

Let (n )nZd and (n )nZd be two independent copies of (n)nZd . By applying the decoupling inequality (see Theorem 3.1.1 in De la Pen~a and Gin´e [9], p.99) and Jensen's inequality, we get for any
t > 0,





E [ (|E1 [Xk]| /t)]

=

E





1 t

au,vk-uk-v 

u,vk-1







E





C t

au,vk -uk-v  .
u,vk-1

Hence

E1 [Xk]   C

au,vk -uk-v .

u,vk-1



Therefore, applying the Burkholder inequality for Orlicz spaces (see Meyer and Dellacherie [8], p.304,

VII - 92), we get

E1 [Xk]





C

 



a2u,v

k-u 

k-v

 

.



(u,v)(k-1,k-1)

u=v

By stationarity and since 0  < , we obtain, by using assumption (20), that condition (8) holds. Thus the CLT in Corollary 2.5 holds.
