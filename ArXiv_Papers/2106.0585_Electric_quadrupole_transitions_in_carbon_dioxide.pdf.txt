Recent advances in the high sensitivity spectroscopy have made it possible, in combination with accurate theoretical predictions, to observe for the first time very weak electric quadrupole transitions in a polar polyatomic molecule of water. Here we present accurate theoretical predictions of the complete quadrupole ro-vibrational spectrum of a non-polar molecule CO2, important in atmospheric and astrophysical applications. Our predictions are validated by recent cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy measurements and are used to assign few weak features in the recent ExoMars ACS MIR spectroscopic observations of the martian atmosphere. Predicted quadrupole transitions appear in some of the mid-infrared CO2 and water vapor transparency regions, making them important for detection and characterization of the minor absorbers in water- and CO2-rich environments, such as present in the atmospheres of Earth, Venus and Mars.

The intensities of electric quadrupole (E2) transitions are known to be very weak, six to eight orders of magnitude smaller than the intensities of electric dipole (E1) transitions. Until very recently, the E2 transitions were measured only in non-polar or slightly polar diatomics, such as H2 [1­6], O2 [7, 8], N2 [9­13], HD [14], N+2 [15], i.e. molecules that otherwise do not exhibit E1 transitions or, as regards HD, they are extremely weak. In polar molecules, with polyatomics being considerably richer in the number and density of ro-vibrational transitions, strong E1 absorption profiles blanket most of the weak features in the ro-vibrational spectrum.
Tracing and assigning weak spectral features as belonging to the E1 transitions of minor isotopologues or other meager molecular species, or indeed the E2 or magnetic dipole (M1) transitions of the main molecular constituent, can be endlessly intricate and hence can benefit from precise theoretical predictions. So far as there were no reliable calculations of the E2 and magnetic dipole M1 transitions for polyatomic molecules, detection of these electric-dipole-forbidden features and investigation of their seemingly surreptitious role in high-resolution spectroscopy remains unexplored.
The role of weak ro-vibrational transitions in spectrum of carbon dioxide (CO2) is fundamental to monitoring its isotopic composition in the atmosphere for understanding of carbon cycle processes [16­19] and it is becoming increasingly precise for determination of new gas signatures in CO2-rich planetary atmospheres, such as Mars and Venus. To this end, the completeness of spectroscopic data for the main isotopologue 12C16O2 is crucial, especially in its transparency windows, to reduce the likelihood of its weak spectroscopic features being mistakenly assigned to those of minor isotopologues or other less-abundant molecular species [20, 21]. For example, recently discovered weak M1 transitions of CO2 in the

spectrum of the martian atmosphere [21] would not be known as belonging to CO2 without the accurate knowledge of the E1 transitions of its main and minor isotopologues. While there have been multiple and still ongoing computational and experimental efforts to fully characterize the E1 spectra of major isotopologues of CO2 [22­ 24], the contributions from the dipole-forbidden E2 and, until very recently M1 [21], transitions have not had the slightest attention.
In this contribution, we report the first complete and accurate E2 line list for carbon dioxide 12C16O2, which was validated in the 3.3 µm transparency window by recent laboratory measurements using OpticalFeedback-Cavity Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy (OFCEAS) [25]. Based on our predictions and laboratory measurements, we report a detection of the E2 lines in the martian atmospheric spectra recorded by the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter Atmospheric Chemistry Suite (ACS) instrument [26]. We also present our newly developed variational computational methodology, which is capable of high-accuracy predictions of the E2 spectra for arbitrary polar molecules.
Our computational approach is based on the general variational approach TROVE [27­30], which for triatomic molecules employs an exact kinetic energy operator [31]. For CO2, an accurate empirically refined potential energy surface (PES) `Ames-2' was employed [32]. In TROVE, the vibrational basis set is constructed in a multi-step procedure from contracted and symmetryadapted products of one-dimensional basis sets, each represented by solutions n(q) (n = 0, 1, 2...) of the onedimensional Schrödinger equation for a selected vibrational mode q [29]. For CO2 there are two stretching and one bending vibrational modes, with the respective quantum numbers n1, n2, n3. Since CO2 is linear, its bending vibration is coupled to a molecular rotational

2

motion about the linearity axis, which is the molecular z

axis. For this reason, the bending basis functions cannot

be fully decoupled from the molecular rotation and para-

metrically depend on the rotational quantum number K of the J^z angular momentum operator, hence the notation n(3K). We refer for details of treatment of linear and
quasi-linear molecules to [31]. The size of vibrational ba-

sis was controlled by the condition 2(n1+n2)+n(3K)  64. The full ro-vibrational basis set is constructed as

a symmetrized product of the symmetry-adapted vi-

Here,  denotes a set of vibrational state quantum numbers, and vib, rot, and  denote the symmetries of the vibrational, rotational and total wave functions, respectively. For CO2 we employed the C2v(M) molecular symmetry group. The total wavefunction for a ro-vibrational state l, with the quantum number of the total angular momentum J and the total symmetry , is a linear combination of ro-vibrational basis set functions:

(lJ,) =

where the linear expansion coefficients c(KJ,,,l) are obtained by solving an eigenvalue problem with the full ro-vibrational Hamiltonian. All energies and eigenfunctions up to J = 40 were generated and used to produce the E2 line list for CO2.
The achieved accuracy of energy level predictions for CO2 is best characterized by the root-mean-squares (rms) deviation of 0.06 cm-1 between the calculated and experimental [33] ro-vibrational term values, evaluated across 337 band centers with energies up to 15 500 cm-1 above zero-point level. Considering the weakness of the E2 lines, the line position accuracy is crucial for discriminating them from the weak E1 lines of minor isotopologues and possible impurities. Further improvement of accuracy would require yet another round of empirical adjustment of the underlying PES, which is an inordinately expensive procedure. As a call for more practical solution very often the variationally computed energies, providing they are close enough to experiment, are replaced by the corresponding experimentally determined values. The latter can be extracted from the experimental spectroscopic line positions using advanced combination difference techniques such as, for example, MARVEL (Measured Active Rotational-Vibrational Energy Levels) [34­37] and RITZ (Rydberg-Ritz combination principle) [38, 39]. For CO2, we used the experimental energy levels from the Carbon Dioxide Spectroscopic Databank [40] produced from a global effective Hamiltonian modeling of an exhaustive set of position measurements available in the literature [41]. More details about

the computational procedure employed here and validation of its accuracy are presented in a study of the E1 line list of CO2 [24].
The quadrupole spectrum was simulated using the variational approach RichMol [42, 43], a computer program designed for calculations of molecular rovibrational dynamics in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. The transition probability from an initial ro-vibrational state |i = (lJ,) into a final state |f = l(J , ) due to the interaction of light with quadrupole moment of molecule is given by

Here, Q, denotes the traceless quadrupole moment tensor in the molecular frame and the matrix U, transforms quadrupole tensor from Cartesian to sphericaltensor form (see, e.g., Eqs. (5-41)­(5-44) in [44]). The nuclear spin statistical factors gns for 12C16O2 are equal to one for initial state symmetries A1 and A2 and zero otherwise.
The quadrupole moment tensor with elements as functions of internal coordinates is required to compute the vibrational expectation values  ,K |Q,|,K in Eq. (4). A three-dimensional mesh of internal coordinates of CO2 was used, containing about 2000 different nuclear geometries and covering the energy range up to hc·40 000 cm-1 above the equilibrium energy. The quadrupole tensor at each point was computed using allelectron CCSD(T) level of theory in conjunction with the aug-cc-pwCVQZ basis set [45­47] and analytic gradient approach [48]. The electronic structure calculations employed the quantum chemistry package CFOUR [49]. For a molecular frame selected such that the x axis bisects the valence bond angle O­C­O and plane of the molecule for bent CO2 is aligned with the xz plane, the three nonzero elements of the quadrupole tensor Qxx, Qzz and Qxz have the A1, A1, and B2 symmetries, respectively. These were parameterized using fourth order symmetryadapted power series expansions through least-squares fittings to the electronic structure data, with rms < 10-4 a.u.
Our results for the quadrupole moment of CO2 Qezz = -3.1666 a.u. = -14.207 × 10-40 Cm2 at the equilibrium re = 1.1614 Å and its zero-point vibrational average QZzzPVA = -3.1627 a.u. = -14.190 × 10-40 Cm2

where  = (El(J , ) - El(J,))/hc is the frequency of transition between lower El(J,) and upper El(J , ) state energies, Z(T ) is the partition function, and  = 1/(kT ). For 12C16O2 we used an accurate computed value of Z(296 K) = 286.094 [22]. The computed quadrupole line
list is provided as supplementary material to the paper.
On the upper panel of Fig. 1, the calculated E2 line list for the main isotopologue, 12C16O2, is superimposed on the E1 line list of the natural CO2 [33]. Both spectra are generated at room temperature, T = 296 K. The E1
lines of the minor isotopologues at natural abundances
are plotted on the figure with cyan color. In general,
the E2 bands are 6­8 orders of magnitude weaker than
the E1 bands. The most prominent E2 band with line intensities of a few 10-29 cm/molecule is the bending plus anti-symmetric stretching 2 +3 band at 3000 cm-1 (3.3 µm), highlighted on the lower panel of Fig. 1.
In contrast with E2 spectrum of water [58, 59], the
E2 lines of CO2 appear largely in the E1 transparency regions, which makes them possible to observe. The rea-
son for this is different approximate selection rules for the
E1 and E2 transitions in CO2 and in linear molecules in general. For example, the 1 and 2 + 3 E1 band transitions at 6.9 and 3.3 µm are dipole forbidden and therefore

The spectra are generated for temperature T = 296 K.

very weak. These bands are however directly allowed for the E2 transition mechanism, even in the rigid-rotor approximation.
As already mentioned, the E1 lines of the minor isotopologues of CO2 make an important contribution to the transparency windows (see Fig. 1), where they overlap with the E2 lines of the main isotopologue. Indeed, the predicted 2 + 3 E2 band of 12C16O2 is almost entirely superimposed with the 2 + 3 E1 band of 16O12C18O, which is stronger by about a factor 20, in spite a natural isotopic abundance of only 4 × 10-3. It should be noted that due to the different symmetry, the 2 + 3 E1 band is allowed in 16O12C18O but forbidden in 12C16O2.
The 2 + 3 band of CO2 has recently been observed in the spectrum of Mars' atmosphere [21], as recorded

4

by the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter ACS-MIR (Atmospheric Chemistry Suite Mid InfraRed) spectrometer. The recorded spectra (partly reproduced in Fig. 3) show strong intensity features that are more specific for the M1 rather than the E2 transitions [60], although no first principles simulations for the M1 spectrum had been done. In particular, the presence of the strong Q-branch, which is very weak for the E2 band, see Fig. 1(b), and the absence of nearly as intense the O- and S-branches argue for a dominant M1 mechanism [60]. But this does not exclude presence of the E2 features in the martian spectrum, although obviously they must be less pronounced. Note that very recently, the dominant M1 2 + 3 band was also detected in the laboratory from long path absorption measurements of 12C16O2 by Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTS) [61]. These measurements indicated that the M1 line intensities estimated from martian spectrum [21] were overestimated by about a factor of two. The effective dipole moment derived from a fit of the measured FTS intensities was used to calculated the line intensities displayed in Fig. 2.
As can be seen from Fig. 1(b), E2 transitions in the Obranch overlap completely with much stronger and generally broader E1 lines of CO2, and hence are hardly discernible. A number of the S-branch transitions appear in a narrow region free from any strong E1 lines, which are thus possible to observe. In Fig. 2, we compare our predicted S-branch transitions near 3020 cm-1 to the ACS MIR transmission spectra displayed on Fig. 4 of [21]. A clear position coincidence of the predicted S(8) and S(12) lines with unknown weak absorption features can be observed in the region 3018­3025 cm-1.
A very recent laboratory study, dedicated to measurements of the weak spectral features in the S-branch of 2 + 3 band of CO2 by OFCEAS [25], has confirmed the strong M1 features originally observed in martian CO2. The measurements have also revealed a number of new features that can be assigned, by comparison with theoretical line list, to the S12, S14, and S16 E2 lines, shown in Fig. 3. Notably, the intensities of the E2 R-branch transitions contribute to about 10-15% of those of the dominant M1 features.
Intensity considerations provide further evidence supporting the detection of E2 lines both in ACS MIR OFCEAS spectra. The intensity of the S8 and S10 E2 lines can be estimated from the martian spectrum by comparison to the nearby R18-R22 for which line intensities are known from FTS laboratory spectra of Ref. [61]. From a multi-line profile fit of the ACS MIR spectrum, the areas of the S8 and S10 lines were derived and scaled according to the absolute intensities of the nearby R18-R22 M1 lines [61]. We obtain 7.0 and 6.5 ×10-29 cm/molecule at 172 K for the absolute intensities of S8 and S10 which is in satisfactory agreement with our theoretically predicted values of 9.5 and 10.0 ×10-29 cm/molecule, respectively. As concerns the S12,

Upper panel: The presently calculated E2 transitions with ab initio intensities (red stems) are superimposed to the M1 transitions with intensities calculated in [61] (black stems). Lower panel: ACS MIR spectrum (red line) with a best-fit synthetic model containing the contributions of the E1 bands of CO2 and H2O based on HITRAN 2016 database and of the M1 lines identified in [21]. The assignments of the newly detected S8 and S10 E2 transitions are marked with red arrows.
S14 and S16 lines observed in the OFCEAS spectra (Fig. 3), their intensities (and pressure broadening coefficients) were reported in Ref. [25]. The OFCEAS intensities are also close to their predicted values, although showing a difference on the order of 30%, slightly larger than the estimated OFCEAS uncertainty.
The experience of ab initio E2 intensity calculations for polyatomic molecules is very limited. Based on the wealth of the E1 experimental and theoretical investigations, it is nowadays normal to expect a 10-20% error (for stronger bands) from ab initio predictions of electric dipole intensities using standard levels of theory, as in this work (CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pwCVQZ). However the electric quadrupole calculations are still unexplored territory. According to the current work, our prediction of the two E2 lines from 2 + 3 amounts to a 30% (overestimated) error in intensities at T = 172 K. In fact, a similar quality of the ab initio intensities was reported for for the 1 + 3 E2 transitions of water in [58], which varied between 8 and 90% underestimating the experimental intensities. More work is needed, both experimental and theoretical, to establish the quality of the modern ab initio methods for the E2 intensities.
In summary, we presented an accurate computational methodology for calculating the electric quadrupole spectra of polyatomic molecules with arbitrary structure. Calculated quadrupole transitions of CO2 were confirmed by the high sensitivity spectroscopic measurements [25] with few of them newly identified in the spectrum of

DATA AVAILABILITY

Mars' atmosphere.The quadrupole transitions are typically a million times weaker than the electric dipole transitions. The accurate characterization of the quadrupole transitions for the main atmospheric absorbers, especially in the mid-infrared transparency windows, will eliminate the misassignment of spectral features and thus help in precise detection of the minor atmospheric constituents. Being particularly sensitive to steeply varying fields, which are common in nature at the moleculemolecule and molecule-surface interfaces [62­64], the electric quadrupole transitions can potentially be used for remote sensing of local molecular environments.
