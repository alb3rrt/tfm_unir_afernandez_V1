Abstract In this paper, the Joule-Thomson Expansion of Born-Infeld AdS black holes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is studied in the extended phase space. The inversion curves and the isenthalpic curves are discussed in detail.

1 Introduction
Einstein's General Theory of Relativity (GR), the cornerstone of modern cosmology, provides an accurate description of the phenomena in our universe. To go beyond Einstein's theory, one usually modifies GR by adding some higher derivative terms or new degrees of freedom of the metric to the

field equations, by considering other fields other than the metric, by extending to higher dimensions, and so on. In a recent letter from Glavan and Lin [1], they claimed to have a non-trivial Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory of gravity, with no additional field coupling with curvature. They proposed a generalized covariant corrected theory of gravity with only massless gravitons propagating in the space-time dimension D = 4, and defined the theory bypassing Lovelock's theorem as the limit of D  4 in higher dimensions. In this singular limit, Gauss-Bonnet invariants make a non-trivial contribution to gravitational dynamics, while retaining the number of graviton degrees of freedom and being immune to Ostrogradsky instability. This theory, now called the new four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss Bonnet (EGB) gravity, will modify the dispersion relationship between cosmological tensors and scalar modes.
In Maxwell's theory of electrodynamics, the value of the electric field diverges at the position of the charge. In order to solve these divergence problems, Born and Infeld developed a famous nonlinear electromagnetic theory in 1934 [2] called Born-Infeld (BI) electrodynamics. They introduced a force by likening the intensity of the electromagnetic field to the relativistic limit of velocity, and regularized the self-energy of the divergence of ultraviolet light from the point charge like in classical dynamics. BI electrodynamics has been widely used since spontaneous BI action can be generated in some limit range of string theory [3].
Black hole thermodynamics has been in the spotlight since Hawking and Bekenstein proposed the four laws [4] of thermodynamics for black holes. Research shows that black holes in AdS space have similar characteristics to general thermodynamic systems. There is a well-known process in classical thermodynamics, called Joule-Thomson expansion, was generalized to charged AdS black holes in Ref.[5]. Subsequently, the Joule-Thomson expansion of black holes has been extensively studied, such as Hayward-AdS black hole [6], Bardeen-AdS black hole [7, 8], Charged AdS black holes in Rainbow gravity [9], Kerr-AdS black hole [10], The inversion and isenthalpic curves were obtained and the heating-cooling regions were illustrated in the T - P plane. Based on the significance of 4D EGB gravity theory and BornInfeld electrodynamics, we investigate the Joule-Thomson expansion of BI AdS black holes in 4D EGB gravity.
The paper is organized as follows: In Sect.2, we display the thermodynamic quantities of BI AdS black holes in 4D EGB gravity. In Sect.3, We give discussions for the Joule-Thomson expansion of the BI AdS black holes

in 4D EGB gravity, which include the Joule-Thomson coefficient, the inversion curves, the minimum inversion temperature and the isenthalpic curves. We end the paper with closing remakes in the last section.

In addition, f (r) recovers the BI-AdS black hole solution obtained in the Einstein-Born-Infeld(EBI) gravity [13, 14] in the limit   0.
By solving the equation f (r) = 0, we can obtain the event horizon radius r+ of the black hole. The mass M , Hawking temperature T and entropy S of four dimensional BI AdS black hole can be written as

In previous work [15], we have analyzed the van der Waals-like phase transition and critical behavior of the black hole system under different parameters in detail. We also found that within certain parameters, the system admits a standard SBH/IBH/LBH phase transition, which is reminiscent of a solid/liquid/gas phase transition.

3 Joule Thomson Expansion

In the Joule-Thomson expansion process, increasing pressure slowly pushes the gas through the plug under a sealed and insulated condition, and finally achieves equilibrium on both sides. We can use the Joule-Thomson coefficient to describe the ratio of the temperature change to the pressure change after the expansion of a gas

Black hole systems have similar properties to van der Waals fluid, so the Joule-Thomson expansion of black holes is a hot research field in recent years. A classic model for the Joule-Thomson expansion of black holes the charged black holes in 4D AdS spacetime. The black hole solution can be expressed as

f (r) = 1 - r + r2 + l2 .

Ozgur [5] studied the inversion curve images corresponding to different Q values, he found that the ratio of the minimum inversion temperature to the

critical

temperature

of

the

system

was

always

1 2

no

matter

what

the

value

was. In addition, by setting the mass M of the black hole as a constant,

he obtained the equiinclusion curve similar to that of the van der Waals

fluid system. Kartheek and his partners showed Joule Thomson expansion

of charged black hole in 4D Gauss Bonnet gravity [16]. They found that the

charge Q had little effect on the inversion curve, while the Joule Thomson

expansion is guided by the GB coupling constant .

Shihao Bi [17] studied the Joule-Thomson expansion of a Born-Infeld

black hole in 4-dimensional AdS space-time. In his work, The inversion tem-

perature increases with the increase of the inversion pressure, but the slope

of the inversion curve decreases with the increase of the inversion pressure,

the inversion temperature also increases monotonically with charge Q and

parameter . In addition, in the limit   ,the ratio of the minimum

inversion

temperature

Ti

to

the

critical

temperature

Tc

approaches

1 2

,

which

is consistent with charged black holes.

It is worth mentioning that the inversion curve of van der Waals fluid

is divided into high and low. In general, there is only one inversion curve

corresponding to the black hole system, because a black hole system usually

does not have high and low inversion temperatures. However, in the study of

Joule-Thomson expansion in AdS black holes with momentum relaxation by

Cisterna and Hu [18], they obtained a high and low inversion curve similar

to the van der Waals fluid system.

Now we consider Joule-Thomson expansion of BI-AdS Black Hole in 4D

EGB gravity.

From Eq.(10), we can find the inversion temperature

Figure 1: Inversion curves for Born-Infeld AdS Black Holes in 4D EGB gravity in Ti - Pi plane with Q = 1.In the left panel, we take  = 0.01, = 0.1, 1, 2, 5, 10, . In the right panel, we take  = 0.1, = 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1 .

curves for different values of  and  are shown in Fig.1. When the values of Q

and  are fixed, the inversion curve increases monotonically with the increase

of the value of , and the slope gradually decreases. This is consistent with

the results obtained by Shihao Bi [17]. Based on previous experience, we also

investigate whether the ratio of the minimum inversion temperature to the

critical temperature of the system still tends to 1/2 as  tends to infinity,

where the minimum inversion temperature T imin is the value of inversion

temperature T i when the inversion pressure P i is 0. First we explore the

case where Q is constant. Here we take Q = 1,the result is shown in Fig.2.

As can be seen from Fig.2, with the increase of , the curves corresponding

to different  gradually approach to a fixed value. When  is very small,

the

curve

Next, we discuss the relationship between the minimum inversion tem-

perature and the critical temperature under the condition of fixed . Images

corresponding to different  are shown in Fig.3 and Fig.4.

In order to make sure that the thermodynamics of the system are all

real, we take  = 10, 30, . In Fig.3(a), when   0, we get the same

result as shown in Ref.[17]. In this case, when  tends to infinite, the black

hole degenerates into the RN-AdS black hole, and the ratio of the minimum

inversion temperature to the critical temperature is a horizontal line equal

to

1 2

.

In other cases, as the charge Q increases, the ratio of the minimum

inversion temperature to the critical temperature is monotonically increasing

and eventually tends to

1 2

.

Comparing Fig.3(a) with Fig.3(b), we can find

the Gauss-Bonnet term makes the curves tend to 1/2 slowly. In Fig.4, we

separately plot the cases of  = 10 and    with different , and the

two figures are almost the same, which means  and Q have a much greater

effect on the ratio curve than .

Joule-Thomson expansion is an isenthalpy process. In the extended phase

space, mass can be interpreted as enthalpy. Therefore, we can plot the isoen-

thalpy curve in the T - P plane by fixing the mass of the black hole. The

isenthalpic curves are given by Eq.(4) with r+ being the larger root of Eq.(3) at given M . The isenthalpic curves and the inversion curves of Born-Infeld

AdS black holes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity are shown in Fig.5.

The inversion curve is the dividing line between heating and cooling. The

slope of the isoenthalpy curve on the inversion curve is positive. So there's

cooling above the inversion curve. Instead, signs of slope change and warming

appear below the inversion curve.

As can be seen from Fig.5, no matter what the value is, the isoenthalpy

curve is always a closed quasi-semicircle. Meanwhile, with the increase of

Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant , the isoenthalpy curve tends to shrink.

4 Final Remarks
In the 4D EGB gravity, we have studied the Joule-Thomeson expansion of Born-Infeld AdS black hole in the extended phase space. The well-known Joule-Thomeson coefficient µ was derived via the first law of black hole thermodynamics. We studied the dependence of  and  on the inversion curves, the results were depicted in Fig.1. The minimum inversion temperature versus the charge Q,  and  is displayed on Fig.3 and Fig.4, which shows the slope of the inversion curve is always positive. This result means the black hole always cools (heats) above (below) the inversion curve during the expansion. For different values of , Q and , we can distinguish the cooling and heating regions with the inversion curve. The constant enthalpy curves for fixed mass are shown in Fig.5, every constant enthalpy curve is closed.
