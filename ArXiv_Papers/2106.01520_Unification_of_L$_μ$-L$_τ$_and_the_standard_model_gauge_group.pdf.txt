In this letter we show a kind of Lµ- L gauge symmetry can be unified into a simple group with the standard model gauge symmetry in the context of coset space unification. We also discuss some implication from one of this kind of unification.

Introduction The standard model (SM) is a very successful theory and well established. Indeed almost all terrestrial experiments are explained by SM. However, there are several questions: how to explain the lepton flavor violation appearing in neutrino oscillation [1], the existence of dark matter, the baryon asymmetry, the discrepancy of muon anomalous magnetic moment between the theoretical [2] and experimental value [3], etc. To explain (some of) them many trials have been made by extending the SM. As one of the direction in these years many physicists extend the gauge symmetry, say, Lµ- L [4­7]. It gives plausible explanation [8­10] for muon anomalous magnetic moment and, in addition, may give a solution to Hubble inconsistency [11, 12] and IceCube Gap too [13­16].
Besides those phenomenological questions, there are fundamental and/or conceptual questions in SM: Why are there three gauge groups SU(3), SU(2), U(1)? Why does nature has matters, in other words, for example why do quarks behave as a triplet of SU(3)? Why are there three copies of materials? Why does exist three generations? The former can be explained partly by the unification of the gauge group, the Grand Unified Theory (GUT).
Then it is natural to ask whether Lµ- L can be unified with the standard model gauge group, i.e. grander unified theory. Naively it looks difficult since (i) only leptons have Lµ- L charge and (ii) there is a generation dependence. In unified theories quarks are unified into same multiplet with leptons and hence not only leptons but also quarks should have Lµ- L charge. Therefore we have to give up a simple (only leptophilic) Lµ- L and we also assign its charge to quarks. On the contrary generation dependence means that Lµ- L is gauged family symmetry. Implementing them appropriately, in this letter we will see a kind of Lµ- L and SM gauge group are unified within the context of coset space unification [17].
Coset space unification We first review the structure of coset space unification. Three family fermions including right-handed neutrinos naturally are accommodated in the coset-space family unification[18] in supersymmetric (SUSY) GUTs. Coset-spaces based on E7 are known as unique choices to contain three families of quarks and leptons [19]. Among them E7/SU(5)×U(1)3

is the most interesting, since it contains also three families of right-handed neutrinos as Nambu-Goldstone (NG) multiplets [20]. This model contains three families of 10i + 5i + 1i (i = 1, 2, 3) as NG multiplets. Though in addition, there is an extra 5, we ignore it in this letter. Here, the SU(5) is the usual GUT gauge group. Their quantum numbers under the unbroken subgroup are given in Table I. Incidentally, though there is an extra 5, we will ignore it in this letter hereafter as it is irrelevant. These U(1)'s are interpreted as those from

SU(5) 101 102 103 51 52 53 11 12 13

U(1)1 0 0 2 0 2 2 0 2 2

U(1)2 0 3 -1 3 -1 2 3 -1 -4

U(1)3 4 -1 -1 3 3 -2 -5 -5 0

TABLE I: U(1) charges of the NG multiplets. The U(1)1, U(1)2 and U(1)3 are the unbroken U(1)'s of coset-subspaces E7/E6×U(1), E6/SO(10)×U(1) and SO(10)/SU(5)×U(1), respectively.

the breaking chain

E7 - E6 × U(1)1 - SO(10) × U(1)1 × U(1)2

- SU(5) × U(1)1 × U(1)2 × U(1)3

(1)

The subscripts of fields in table I (and also following tables) are not generation indices but the embedding (or definition) of fields into E7 adjoint representation. For example at the first breaking, 13, 12, 53, 52, and 103 appear in the spectrum. Similarly 11 51 102 does at the second breaking. At the last 101 arises.
Rearrangement of U(1) charge for Lµ- L As U(1)'s are commutable and hence we can take linear combination, that is,

Qi = aij qj ,

(2)

where qj is given in the table I and Qi's are the new U(1) charges. The existence of Lµ- L indicates that one of

2

rearranged U(1), say new U(1)3, charge Q3 for a pair of 10 and 5 must be ±1, 0. Indeed there are three kinds of such recombination, given by

Each solution gives independent breaking chain.

TABLE III: U(1) charges of the NG multiplets in breaking (4). The U(1)1, U(1)2 and U(1)3 are the unbroken U(1)'s of coset-subspaces E7/SO(10)×SU(2)×U(1), SO(10)/SU(5)×U(1) and SU(2)/U(1), respectively.

SU(5) 101 102 103 51 52 53 11 12 13

TABLE II: U(1) charges of the NG multiplets in breaking (3). The U(1)1, U(1)2 and U(1)3 are the unbroken U(1)'s of coset-subspaces E7/E6×U(1), E6/SU(5)×SU(2)×U(1) and SU(2)/U(1), respectively.

The first recombination leads new U(1) charges given in table II. These U(1)'s are interpreted as residual one from the breaking chain

E7 - E6 × U(1)1 - SU(5) × SU(2) × U(1)1 × U(1)2

- SU(5) × U(1)1 × U(1)2 × U(1)3=µ-

(6)

In this chain both (53 , 52) and (102,101) appear as SU(2) doublet at the second breaking.
The second one arises from the breaking chain

E7 - SO(10) × SU(2) × U(1)1 - SU(5) × SU(2) × U(1)1 × U(1)2 - SU(5) × U(1)1 × U(1)2 × U(1)3=µ- (7)
Their U(1) charges are shown in table III. In this chain both SO(10) 16=(101+51+11) and (103+53+13) form an SU(2) doublet at the first breaking. Note that U(1) charges for 11 are reversed from the naive change by (4). It is due to the fact that we always have a freedom of choice to extracting a representation r or r as NG boson. As we need GUT representation while we have no

choice to select say, 10, we can switch 1 to 1. It may lead drastic change of phenomenology though we will not touch this point in this letter.

SU(5) 101 102 103 51 52 53 11 12 13

U(1)1 4 0 0 4 4 0 -4 -4 0

U(1)2 2 -3 -3 -1 -1 -6 -5 -5 0

U(1)3=µ- 0 1 -1 1 -1 0 -1 1 -2

TABLE IV: U(1) charges of the NG multiplets in breaking (5). The U(1)1, U(1)2 and U(1)3 are the unbroken U(1)'s of cosetsubspaces E7/SU(6)×SU(2)×U(1), SU(6)/SU(5)×SU(1) and SU(2)/U(1), respectively.

The final one corresponds to the breaking chain
E7 - (SU(6) × SU(2) × U(1)1) - SU(5) × SU(2) × U(1)1 × U(1)2 - SU(5) × U(1)1 × U(1)2 × U(1)3=µ- (8)
In this chain both (51,52) and (102,103) appear as SU(2) doublet at the second breaking.
Again U(1) charges for 11 and 12 are reversed from the naive change by (5). In addition in this breaking chain we should not have the first stage, that is, we should interpret that E7 breaks directly to SU(5)×SU(2)×U(1). Otherwise we could not realize three 10's. These lead drastic change of phenomenology too though we will not touch this point in this letter.
Thus there are essentially these three chains. It is understood by following two steps. The first one is

3

that there are four maximal subgroups of E7 including SU(5), which are E6×U(1), SO(12)×SU(2), SU(8), and SU(6)×SU(3). The second is among them we can directly check that it is impossible to get three 10 and three 5 via SU(8) by direct calculation. We note also that these three chains are independent. It is understood by the fact that U(1) charges for "right-handed neutrinos" are different. Therefore in each chain, in principle, we will have a quite different phenomenology for, at least, neutrino physics.
Incidentally, new U(1)1 and U(1)2 for the first breaking chain while q2 and q3 are exchangeable in the second and the third chain. This exchange may lead to different phenomenology.
Matter assignment ­ an example To discuss phenomenology it is necessary to specify an assignment of fermions. To do so we need to know the breaking parameter [17]. While the first breaking chain looks similar to the previous model the others look quite different since the origin of the right-handed neutrino(s) is different. Therefore, hereafter we study the breaking chain (6). In this U(1) assignment, µ-flavored doublet belongs to 52 and  -flavored one does 53. Correspondingly µflavored singlet belongs to 102 and  -flavored one does belong to 101. The remaining e-flavord leptons are contained in 51 and 103. The embedding of other fermions is arbitrary. Though it is determined by the mass spectrum of fermions it is beyond the scope of this letter. Therefore, we assume that the predictions for lepton mixing and quark mixing given in [17] hold even after the recombination. By this the embedding for quark doublets is also determined. We still have the freedom for the embedding of right-handed quarks. Here we examine one of the possibilities that look most interesting.
In this model the assignment of fermions is given by

101 = (uc, {uL, dL},  c) 102 = (cc, {cL, sL}, µc) 103 = (tc, {tL, bL}, ec)

51 = (bc, {Le, eL}), (9) 52 = (dc, {Lµ, µL}), (10) 53 = (sc, {L , L}). (11)

Implications With this assignment, the coupling of fermions with Lµ- L gauge boson Z is given by
LZ = gZ {(µ¯µ + ¯LµLµ) - (¯ + ¯L L ) -(u¯5u + d¯5d) + (c¯5c + s¯5c)}Z .(12)

Leptons have a vector coupling with Lµ- L gauge boson while quarks have an axial coupling with it. Therefore in the non-relativistic limit there is no connection between quarks and leptons mediated by Z. For example there is no constraint from atomic physics.
There may be an effect on meson decay. However, as there is no direct coupling of Z to electrons, very tiny effects are expected and hence we would expect that this model is also free from constraints on mesons.
Another implication is on proton decay. Though for dimension-5 operators we have no indication, for

dimension-6 operator that is that mediated by gauge bosons we have an interesting "prediction". Proton decay is induced by 1011015252. It leads

p  µ+0.

(13)

Instead of e+ we will observe µ+. If we find this then it is an prominent signature of the scenario.
Summary and Discussion In this letter, we show a unification of SM gauge and Lµ- L gauge symmetry into a simple group E7 in the context of coset space unification. There are three types of unification that will lead to different phenomenology, at least for neutrino. To check it we need to specify breaking chains and breaking parameters as in [17]. It is beyond the scope of the letter and we leave it in future work. Even though details are a matter of breaking parameters, we show some implications for the first breaking chain since it is similar to the previous work. However, all of the details are made in the future.
