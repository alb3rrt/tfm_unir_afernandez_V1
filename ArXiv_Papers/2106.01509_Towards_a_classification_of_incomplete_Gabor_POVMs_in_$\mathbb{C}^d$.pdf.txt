one matrices form a basis for the space of d × d matrices. A sufficient condition for this to happen

is that the POVM is symmetric, which is equivalent to the fact that the associated Gabor frame

is an equiangular tight frame (ETF). The existence of Gabor ETF is an important special case

of the Zauner conjecture. It is known that generically all Gabor FUNTFs lead to informationally

complete POVMs. In this paper, we initiate a classification of non-complete Gabor POVMs. In the

process we establish some seemingly simple facts about the eigenvalues of the Gram matrix of the

rank one matrices generated by a finite Gabor frame. We also use these results to construct some sets of d2 unit vectors in Cd with a relatively smaller number of distinct inner products.

The (finite) Gabor system G(g) := G(g, Zd × Zd) = {M kT g}kd-, =1 0 generated by a unit vector g  Cd is a Finite Unit Norm Tight Frame (FUNTF), that is

for each x  Cd, see [8, 23]. It follows that G(g) can be cononically associated with a positive operator
valued measure (POVM). By definition, a (Gabor) POVM is informationally complete (IC) if the (d2) rank-one matrices {M kT ggT - M -k}dk-, =1 0 form a basis for Cd2 viewed as the space of d × d matrices. If in addition,

| M kT ggT - M -k, M k T ggT - M -k HS| = | M kT g, M k T g |2

is constant for (k, ) = (k , ), then we say that the Gabor POVM is symmetric (S). Here and in the sequel, we use A, B HS = trace(AB) to denote the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product on Cd2. It is a simple fact to check that every symmetric Gabor POVM is also informationally complete, but the converse is not necessarily true. In the sequel, a (Gabor) FUNTF G(g) will be called a SIC-POVM if the corresponding (Gabor) POVM is symmetric and informationally complete. We refer to [3, 20] for more on POVMs.
It was conjectured by Zauner [24] that for each d  1 there exists a unit vector g  Cd such that the Gabor system G(g) is a SIC-POVM. This conjecture is usually stated in the following form:

Conjecture. [24] In any Cd, d > 2, there exists Gabor SIC-POVM generated by a single unit norm vector g under the orbit of Heisenberg group. In particular, for any k,  Z/dZ \ {(0, 0)}, | g, MkT g | =  1 ,
d+1
The conjecture remains open, and the search for the generating vector (or fiducial vector) has been resolved in dimensions 2 - 16, 19, 24, 28, 35, 48, 124, and 323. Moreover, numerical solutions in dimensions up to 67 have also been established. We refer to [4, 15, 24] and the references therein for more on the Zauner conjecture.
We note that the (full) Gabor frame G(g) always generates a POVM, so the Zauner conjecture asserts that one can always find a generator so that this POVM is also symmetric, and hence informationally complete. The question of completeness of the Gabor POVM had long been investigated and it is known ([17, 12]) that G(g) is an informationally complete if and only if

(1)

g, M kT g = 0  (k, )  Zd × Zd.

It is worth observing that the completeness of Gabor POVMs is central in the theory of phase retrieval [5, 6, 10]. In particular, in [10] it was proved that the injectivity of the phase retrieval map generated by a Gabor system G(g) is equivalent to (1). Furthermore, this condition is generic in the sense that (1) holds for "almost all" unit-norm vectors g.
In this paper, we offer a new proof of the completeness of Gabor POVMs. Our proof is based on the spectral analysis of the d2×d2 Gram matrix associated to the rank-one matrices {M kT ggT - M -k}dk-, =1 0. In particular, we prove that the d2 eigenvalues of this Gram matrix are k, = d| g, M kT g |2 where k, = 0, 1, . . . , d - 1. To the best of our knowledge this simple fact has never been stated in this manner before, though one of the results in [10, Theorem 2.3] asserts that the spectrum of this Gram

matrix lies in the interval [mink, d| g, M kT g |2, maxk, d| g, M kT g |2]. After re-deriving (1), we (re) prove that this condition is generic in the sense that the set of all generators of such systems is open dense in the unit sphere of Cd. We then focus on classifying non-IC Gabor POVMs. This is an interesting problem in its own right and is the primary motivation for this paper. We use some of our classification results to construct k- distance sets of d2 elements in Cd, where k is proportional to d.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give two different characterization of Gabor IC-POVMs. Both characterizations are based on the spectral analysis of the Gramian of the rank-one matrices associated to the Gabor system. The first approach which was mentioned above is based on explicit formulaes for the eigenvalues of the Gram matrix. The second approach is achieved by formulating the problem using an algebraic framework that we hope to use to investigate other POVMs. The algebraic approach also allows us to investigate the rank of the span of the rank-one matrices associated to the non IC Gabor POVMs. In Section 3 we discuss some invariance of the rank of these POVMs. We refer to [18] for a related work dealing with POVMs generated by rank 2 positive semidefinite matrices.

2. Informationally Complete POVMs
The goal of this section is to re-derive the characterization of IC Gabor POVMs. In the sequel, for every vector g we define the support of g to be the set supp(g) = {i| gi = 0}. In addition, the cardinality of supp(g) will be denoted by g 0. Given a unit vector g  Cd, the collection
G(g) = {gk, := M kT g}(k, )Zd×Zd
will denote the (Gabor) FUNTF generated by g. We will view G(g) as an ordered multiset, with respect to the lexicographical order of Zd × Zd, and we shall abuse notation and denote again by G(g) the d × d2 matrix whose columns are the vectors of this frame given in this order. To each vector gk, we associate a rank-one matrix given by
k, := k, (g) = gk,  gk, = gk, gk, . We seek a characterisation of all g for which the rank-one matrices {k, }dk-, =1 0 span the space of all d × d matrices. This is the case if and only if the Gram matrix
G(g) := ( k, , k , ) = (tr(k, k , ))
of this set of matrices if full rank. This is also equivalent to the information completeness of the associated Gabor POVM. Thus we focus on analyzing the rank of G(g) by giving a full descriptions of its spectrum. The completness of Gabor POVM was also obtained in [17, Theorem 15; Section IV-A] and in [12, Section 4.1]. Nonetheless, we point out that our result also gives the rank of the Gram matrix G(g).
The main result of this section is the following theorem that gives the rank of the Gram matrix G(g).

Theorem 1. Let g  Cd be a unit vector. The rank of the Gramian G(g) equals the number
of nonzero entries in the multiset { g, M kT g }(k, )Zd×Zd. Consequently, the Gabor POVM is informationally complete if and only if g, M kT g = 0 for all k, .

In Section 2.1 we compute all the eigenvalues of G(g) obtaining its rank as a consequence. We note that [10, Theorem 2.3] shows that (1) implies that G(g) has full rank. Their proof consists of showing that (1) implies that the lowest eigenvalue of G(g) is positive. Our result shows that (1) is also a necessary for G(g) to be full rank. In Section 2.2, we use an algebraic framework to give a second proof of Theorem 1. We then use this framework in Section 3 to identify some invariants of the rank of G(g).

2.1. Spectrum of the Gramian G(g). In this section, we prove that the Gram matrix G(g) is block circulant with circulant blocks. This structure allows us to compute the eigenvalues of G(g) since it is diagonalizable by an appropriate DFT matrix. In particular, the first part of result is an extension of a well-known fact about block circulant matrices [22, 11]. To the best of our knowledge, the remaining parts are new, though they seem quite simple. Let F := Fd denote the d × d DFT matrix. In particular, the (k, ) entry of F is Fk, = k / d, where  = e2i/d.

Theorem 2. Let g be a unit vector in Cd, and G(g) = ( k, , k , ) be the Gram matrix of the rank-one projectors {k, = M kT g  M kT g}dk-, =1 0. The following statements hold.
(i) G(g) is a block circulant matrix with circulant blocks. In particular, the ((k, ), (k , ))-th entry of G is

G((k, ),(k , ))  k, , k , = | g, M k -kT - g |2,

where k, k , ,  {0, · · · , d - 1}. (ii) G(g) can be diagonalized by F  F . In particular, the eigenvalues {a,b}da-,b=1 0 of G(g) are
given by

a,b =

ak+bl| g, M kT lg |2 = d

gkgk+abk = d| g, M bT ag |2

k,l=0

k=0

where a, b  Zd. In particular, up to a factor of d, the entries of G(g) are the same as its eigenvalues.

Proof. Let g be a unit vector in Cd.
(i) G((k, ),(k , ))(g) = | gk, , gk , |2 = | M kT g, M k T g |2 = | g, M k -kT - g |2. To prove that G(g) is block circulant matrix with circulant blocks, we decompose G(g)
into d2 blocks, each of the size d × d as following:

 A0,0

A0,1

A0,2 · · · A0,d-1

...

...

...

 





Ad-1,0 Ad-1,1 Ad-1,2 · · · Ad-1,d-1

The ( , )-th entry in block Ak,k is then G((k, ),(k , ))(g).

TOWARDS A CLASSIFICATION OF INCOMPLETE GABOR POVMS IN Cd

First we show that G is block circulant, that is, Ak,k = Ak+1,k +1 for any k, k  Zd. For any ,  Zd the ( , )-entry in Ak+1,k +1 is

G((k+1, ),(k +1, )) = | M k+1T g, M k +1T g |2 = | g, M k -kT - g |2.

But this is exactly the ( , )-entry in Ak,k . This shows that G(g) is a block circulant matrix. Furthermore we have Ak,k = A0,k -k. For simplicity, we denote Ak  A0,k, and note that

A1 A2 A3 . . . A0

We next prove that each block Ak is also a circulant matrix. Without loss of generality, we focus on the first row of the blocks. For any k, ,  Zd, the ( + 1, + 1)-th entry of Ak is equal to the ( , )-th entry of Ak, since

| T g, M kT g |2 = | g, M kT - g |2.

This concludes the proof of the first part of the Theorem. (ii) For any a  Zd, consider the functions ha : Cd  Cd2 defined as following

where a = a. We claim that for any eigenvector w of G, w  Range(ha) for some a  Zd. Denote Ha = A0 + A1a + A22a + · · · + Ad-1da-1. By part (i), each Hi is a circulant
matrix, thus can be diagonalized by the d × d DFT matrix F . Suppose v is an eigenvector

of Ha and Hav = v. Then

So the columns of F  F are eigenvectors of G(g). Since F  F is invertible, its columns account for all d2 eigenvectors of G(g).
We now find the spectrum of G(g) which consists of the collections of eigenvalues of {Ha}da-=10. Denoting the (0, n) in Ha as Han, n  {0, 1, · · · , d - 1}. Then the d eigenvalues of Ha are given by

We can now give a proof of Theorem 1.

Proof of Theorem 1. Theorem 1 follows directly from Theorem 2.

Theorem 1 can be rephrased as:

The rank of G(g) is the total number of zero coefficients in the collection of polynomials

Then  = F F .

The next result shows that Gabor informationally complete POVMs are generic in the sense that the set of all such POVMs is an open dense in the set of all FUNTFs of d2 elements in Cd.
Proposition 1. For each d  2 there exists a complete Gabor POVM in Cd. Moreover, the set of all normalized vectors g such that rank(G(g)) = d2 is open dense in the unit sphere in Cd.
Proof. Consider the unit sphere S2d-1  Cd as an algebraic subvariety of the affine 2d space with coordinates Re(gi) and Im(gi) for 1  i  d. The condition rank(G(g)) = d2 is given by the polynomial conditions k, (g) = d| gig¯i+k-i |2 = 0, for all (k, ). For each pair (k, ) with

TOWARDS A CLASSIFICATION OF INCOMPLETE GABOR POVMS IN Cd

7

 k = 0 take g = (1, 0, . . . , 1, 0, . . .)/ 2, with supp(g) = {1, 1 + k}, so we have k, (g) = d/4 = 0.

Likewise, for k = 0 we take g = (1, 0, . . . , 0), and again 0, (g) = 0. Thus for each (k, ) the set Sk, := {g  S2d-1 | k, (g) = 0} is nonempty open dense in the Zariski topology, and so is

S = k, Sk, . [1, 21]

Clearly, if the support of g is the set {1, 2, . . . , s} for s  d/2, then rank(G(g)) < d2, regardless of what is g, as we have gig¯i+s+1 = 0 for all i. However, we can refine Proposition 1 for supports of cardinality > d/2.

Proposition 2. Let S  {1, . . . , d} be a subset of cardinality > d/2. Then there exists a unit vectors g with supp(g) = S and rank(G(g)) = d2.

Proof. Like in the proof of Proposition 1 we consider the algebraic subvariety VS  S2d-1 of all vectors g with supp(g) = S. It in enough to find for each pair (k, ) a vector g  VS such that k, (g) = 0. For each k, the intersection T := S (k+S) = , where we define k+S = {k+i | i  S}. Pick up j  T and let g be the vector such that gi = 0 if i / S, gi = 1 if i  S and i / {j, k + j}, and gi = d if i  {j, k + j}. Let g = g /||g ||. Then the vector wk defined by (wk)i = gig¯ i+k satisfies (wk)j = d2, (wk)i = 0 if i / T , (wk)i = 1 if i  T and i / {j, j + k, j - k} and (wk)i = d otherwise. Therefore k, (g) = d| iT (wk)ii |2/||g ||4  d|d2 - (#T - 1) · d|2/||g ||4 > 0.
In the next result we collect a number of properties about the rank of G(g). In particular, we give all possible values of this rank when g is a unit vector in Cd whose support has size at most 2. In Theorem 4 we will prove a more general result than part (iii).

Proposition 3. For a unit vector g  Cd, we denote by g 0 the number of nonzero entries in g. The following statements hold.

(i) rank(G(g))  d.

(ii) If d is odd, the rank of the Gramian G(g) is also an odd number.

(iii) Suppose that d  2 and g 0 = 1. Then rank(G(g)) = d.

(iv) Suppose that

g

0

= 2.

Then

rank(G(g))

=

3d,

3d

-

1,

2d,

3 2

d

or

d.

Proof. Let g  Cd be a unit vector. For each  Zd, we let w = (gigi+ )di=-01  Cd.

(i) By part (ii) of Theorem 2 we see that 0,0 = d. In addition, note that since the diagonal entries of G(g) are | M kT g, M kT g |2 = 1 where (k, )  Zd × Zd, we have tr(G(g)) = d2. If rank(G(g)) < d, then tr(G(g)) < d2. This is a contradiction.

(ii) Suppose that d is odd. Recall that rank(G(g)) equals to the number of nonzero eigenvalues of

G, and that 0,0 = d > 0. When (a, b) = (0, 0), then (a, b) = (d-a, d-b) and a,b = d-a,d-b.

Consequently, rank(G(g)) = 1 + 2 (a,b)S sgn(a,b), where S = {(a, b) |0  a  d - 1, 0 

b

d-1 2

,

(a, b) = (0, 0)}.

(iii) Without loss of generality we assume that g0 = 1, and gk = 0 for all k = 0. Then w^0 0 = d

and w^ 0 = 0 for all = 0.

(iv) Without loss of generality we assume that g0, g = 0 for some  = 0.

The proof is divided into two cases.

8

It follows that, rank(G(g)) = 3d.

Suppose

and

Then

w^0 0 = d - 1 when there exists an integer c such

that c = -1, otherwise w^0 0 = d. So rank(G(g)) = 3d - 1 or 3d.

Next,

suppose

that

2.2. Algebraic structure of Gabor POVMs. In this section we give another proof of Theorem

1 from an algebraic point of view. In particular, this approach allows us to list several actions that

leave invariant the rank of G(g).

The Weyl-Heisenberg group is the subgroup W  Ud(C) generated by M and T . It has order d3 and every element of W can be written uniquely as aM bT c for integers 0  a, b, c < d. The

elements of W are monomial matrices. A monomial matrix is a square matrix with a unique nonzero

entry in each row and column, which is a phase. A matrix X is monomial, if and only if it can

be written (uniquely) as a product DP , where D is diagonal with diagonal entries of modulus 1,

and P is a permutation matrix. Gabor systems give rise to a monomial representation of W on the

vector space C[G(g)], g is a symbolic vector of indeterminates. Here C[S] denotes the vector space of formal complex linear combinations of the set S. Explicitly, w = aM bT c acts on basis elements

gk, = M kT g by

aM bT cgk, = a-ckgk+b, +c.

We introduce a monomial matrix M(w) of size d2 to denote this action. This matrix is indexed by

(t, s)  Zd  Zd and its ((t, s), (t , s )) entry is given by

 a-ct if (t, s) = (t + b, s + c) M(w)((t,s),(t ,s )) = 0 else.

TOWARDS A CLASSIFICATION OF INCOMPLETE GABOR POVMS IN Cd

9

It is clear by the construction that M is a group homomorphism: M(ww ) = M(w)M(w ). We define another monomial representation, by M (w) := |M(w)|, the entrywise absolute-value.

Consider the Gram matrix H(g) := G(g)G(g), for a unit vector g. Note that this is the Gram matrix of the Gabor frame G(g), and is different from the Gram matrix G(g) of the rank-one matrices we have discussed thus far. In particular, for every d  2, H(g) is a d2 × d2 matrix, and its eigenvalues are only 0 and d. Moreover, 1 H(g) is a self adjoint idempotent of rank d. The matrix
d
H(g) is invariant under the monomial action M:
M(w)H(g)M(w) = H(g), w  W.

The collection

A = A(M) := {X  Md2(C) | w  W, M(w)XM(w) = X}

is a matrix algebra, closed under conjugate transpose. Similarly we have the matrix algebra

A = A(M ) = {X  Md2(C) | w  W, M (w)XM (w) = X}.

Both algebras have dimension d2. In the following theorem, if Z is a group, let C[Z] denote the group algebra over C. In addition, we shall make use of the C-algebra isomorphism

(2)



:

C[X ] Xd - 1



Cd,

given by X  (i)0i<d.

Theorem 3. There is an isomorphism of algebras over C,

(3)

 : A -= Md(C).

There is a sequence of isomorphisms of algebras over C

(4) A -= C[Zd  Zd] -= C[Zd] C C[Zd] -= C[X]/(Xd - 1) C C[X]/(Xd - 1) -----= Cd C Cd = Cd2 .
The first isomorphism respects the conjugate-transpose. Let µ : A -= Cd2 denote the composition. Under µ the conjugate transpose becomes complex conjugation on Cd2.

Proof. Let us construct first the inverse map -1 : Md(C)  A. The complex vector space Md(C) has the special basis {M iT j}0i,j<d. It is enough to define -1 on this basis, and show that it is an algebra homomorphism. For each (i, j), we first construct a matrix E(i, j)  A, which satisfies E(i, j)(p,q),(0,0) = (i,j),(p,q). The matrix E(i, j) is uniquely determined by these properties. Indeed, by the invariance under the monomial matrices M(w),
E(i, j)(a+i,b+j),(a,b) = M(M aT b)(a+i,b+j),(i,j)E(i, j)(i,j),(0,0)M(T -bM -a)(0,0),(a,b) = -bi · 1 · M(-abM -aT -b)(0,0),(a,b) = -bi · 1 · -ab+ab = -bi.

10

ASSAF GOLDBERGER, SHUJIE KANG, AND KASSO A. OKOUDJOU

A similar computation shows that E(i, j)(a ,b ),(a,b) = 0 if (a , b ) = (a + i, b + j). This shows the uniqueness of E(i, j). On the other hand, it is easy to check that if we define E(i, j) by these formulae, then E(i, j)  A. Note that E(i, j) is monomial and that |E(i, j)| = |M(M iT j)|.
Next we compare E(i + s, j + t) with E(i, j)E(s, t). We have

(E(i, j)E(s, t))(a+i+s,b+j+t),(a,b) = E(i, j)(a+i+s,b+j+t),(a+s,b+t)E(s, t)(a+s,b+t),(a,b) = -(b+t)i-bs = -b(i+s)-it.

We also have E(i + s, j + t)(a+i+s,b+j+t),(a,b) = -b(i+s).
Hence E(i, j)E(s, t) = -itE(i + s, j + t). We try to define

(5)

-1(M iT j) = f(i,j)E(i, j) for some f (i, j)  Zd,

and we extend -1 by linearity to a vector-space homomorphism. We wish to find an f , such that -1 will be actually an algebra homomorphism. A necessary and sufficient condition for this is that -1(M iT j · M sT t) = -1(M iT j) · -1(M sT t). Then using (5) and equality M iT j · M sT t = -jsM i+s,j+t, we must have

f (i, j)f (s, t) = -js-itf (i + s, j + t).

This condition is satisfied by the choice f (i, j) = ij, so

(6)

-1(M iT j) := ijE(i, j)

extends to a C-algebra homomorphism Mn(C)  A. For (a, b) = (c, e) modulo d, -1(M aT b) and -1(M cT e) have disjoint supports, hence -1 is
injective. By comparing dimensions we conclude that -1 is an algebra isomorphism. Since both M iT j and -1(M iT j) are monomial matrices, then their conjugate-transpose is equal to their inverse, and -1 being a ring isomorphism respects matrix inverses. Hence  commutes with the
conjugate-transpose. This completes the first part.

The map  : Zd  Zd  GLd2(C) given by (s, t) = M (M aT b) is a group homomorphism. Then we can extend  to a C-algebra map  : C[Zd  Zd]  Md2(C). This map is injective since as above {M (M aT b)}(a,b) have disjoint supports. Also, as ww and w w differ only by a phase, M (w w) = M (ww ) = M (w)M (w ), and in particular M (w ) is stable under conjugation
with M (w). It follows that the image of  is in A . Comparing dimensions, we obtain the first
isomorphism in (4). The other isomorphisms are well known and natural. They are given by the maps [(a, b)]  [a]  [b]  Xa  Xb  [1, a, 2a, . . . (d-1)a]  [1, b, 2b, . . . (d-1)b]  (iajb)i,j. Under those maps, the conjugate-transpose in A is compatible with the negation map [(a, b)] 
[(-a, -b)], which translates into complex conjugation at the rightmost term.

We remark that the isomorphism (2)  : C[X]/(Xd - 1)  Cd is given by the Chinese Remainder Theorem for polynomials. That is, since Xd - 1 = i(X - i), then

C[X]/(Xd - 1) = C[X]/(X - i) = Cd.

The map  takes a polynomial f to the vector (f (i))i. Then this linear operation is nothing

but the discrete Fourier transform. If we write f (X) =

(f ) = dF · [f0, f1, . . . , fd-1]T  Cd. Given an element X  A, the matrix X(2) defined by

Xi(,2j) := |Xi,j|2 is a member of A . In the spacial case X = H(g), writing G(g) = {g0,0, . . . , gd,d} and

letting i,j = gi,jgi,j, then G(g) := Xi(,2j) = T r(i,ji,j)  A , and rank G(g) is the dimension of

the complex vector space spanned by the i,j. We have

Lemma 1. Under the isomorphism (4) µ : A  Cd2, the rank of X  A equals the number of nonzero entries in µ(X).

Proof. By the isomorphism µ, the algebra A contains a list of d2 nontrivial idempotents e1, . . . , en2, summing up to 1 and satisfying eiej = 0 for i = j. On letting A act on a the vector space V = Cd2,
we have V = j ejV , and this decomposition respects the action of A . As A acts faithfully on V , and ekA acts as zero on ejV for j = k, then ejV = 0 for all j, and by equating dimensions we
conclude that each ejV is 1-dimensional. Hence µ is nothing but a simultaneous diagonalization of
the algebra A and the lemma follows.

3. Invariance properties of the rank of Gabor POVMs
In this section we identify a number of transformations leaving the rank of G(g) invariant, and moreover leave invariant the multiset of the internal angles between the vectors of G(g). We exploit this to first classify all unit-norm vectors g for which the rank of G(g) is d. Next, we introduce a notion of an automorphism group of Gabor frames, and construct examples of m-distance sets with small m. Finally, we prove that rank(G(g)) cannot take a value strictly between d and 2d when d > 2 is a prime.

For a nonzero vector g = (g0, g1, . . . , gd-1)T  Cd, we let
ak, = ak, (g) := gng¯n+kn .
n
We recall that the k-translation k + S of a subset S  Zd,is the set {k + s| s  S}. We shall make the convention that if r is a real number, then r := e2 -1r/d. For m  Z×d , let m-1  Z×d denote its group inverse. Given g  Cd, it is not difficult to prove that each of the following transformations of g resulting in a vector h preserves the ranks rank(G(h)) = rank(G(g)) and the following transformation rules:

1. Phase: Let h = cg for |c| = 1. Then ak, (h) = ak, (g). 2. Additive translation: Let hi = gi+t. We have

(7)

ak, (h) = -t ak (g).

12

3. Multiplicative: Let hi = gmi, where gcd(m, d) = 1. We have

(8)

ak, (h) = amk,m-1 (g).

4. (Phase) Quadratic: Let hi = gia(2i)+bi+c, wherec is a real number, a is an integer, and b is an integer of a half integer such that a(d - 1)/2 + b is an integer. We have

(9)

ak, (h) = ak, -ak(g)-bk-a(k2).

We remark that the condition on b implies that the transformation is well-defined if we

consider the index i as real integer.

3.1. Characterization of rank d Gabor POVMs. In this section give a complete characterization of all vectors g leading to rank d Gabor POVMs. We note that this generalizes part (iii) of Proposition 3.

Theorem 4. Let r be a divisor of d, and define a vector g := g(r, d)  Cd by  1 i  0 mod r
g(r, d)i = 0 otherwise.
Then the rank of G(g) is d, and G(g) is a 2-distance set. Conversely, up to translation and phase quadratic transformations, a normalized vector g has rank d, if and only if g = 1 g(, d) for some
d/
|d.

Proof. For g defined as above, we see that ak, (g) = n gng¯n+kn = 0 if k is not a multiple of r. Otherwise atr, = n=rj grjg¯r(j+t)n = n=rj n . This quantity vanishes if and only if r = 1. Equivalently is a multiple of d/r. Hence atr,sd/r(g) are precisely the ones that do not vanish and there are d of them.
It remains to prove the only if part. Assume that rank(G(g)) = d for a unit vector g. One eigenvalue of G(g) is d|a0,0(g)|2 = d i |gi|2 = d. Notice that |ak, (g)|  i |gi||gi+k|  g 2 = 1 by the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, hence d is the largest eigenvalue. As tr(G(g)) = d2 and the
rank is d, we must conclude that d appears with multiplicity d, and all other eigenvalues are 0.
Let S = supp(g), and let  be the smallest positive integer such that i,  + i  S. Then the
vector (gigi+)i = 0, and (a, ) is its discrete Fourier transform. It follows that a, = 0 for some . If  = d then S is a singleton and g = g(d, d) up to phase and translation. So we shall assume
from now that  < d.

where we applied the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality once more. This can happen if and only if S  ( + S) = S, so S must be -periodic. In particular  must divide d.
By applying translation, we may assume without loss of generality that S is the subsets of multiples of , and for a given k there exists an such that ak, = 0, if and only if k = t. Take t = 1. By applying a phase quadratic transformation (type 4'), we may assume that |a,0| = 1. By Cauchy-Schwartz we conclude that the vectors (gi) and g+i are proportional, so gi = g+i for all i, with || = 1. Modifying by a phase we may assume that g0 = 1/ d/ hence gj = j/ d/. In particular for j = d/ we obtain d/ = 1. Modifying by linear phase (type 4) we obtain g = g(, d)/ d/.

Remark. Choosing r = d, we recover part (iii) of Proposition 3.

3.2. Examples of automorphisms of two types of Gabor systems. The list of transformations

1­4' above gives rise to a notion of an automorphism group of a Gabor systems. We define the group Gd as the group of all maps Cd  Cd generated by the transformations 1­4'. For every unit vector g, let Aut(g)  Gd be the subgroup fixing g. We call this the Automorphism group of g. We can easily create vectors g with nontrivial automorphisms. For example, if gi+ = gi for all i and |d, then g is a periodic vector having nontrivial translations as automorphisms. Likewise if

gmi = gi for all i, gcd(m, d) = 1, then g has multiplicative automorphisms. A more interesting example will be a vector g, such that for all i, gi+ = gi(2i)+i+, for fixed , , ,   Zd. So any
such g has a nontrivial automorphism, which is a composition of phase-quadratic and a translation
transformations. If gcd(, d) = 1, then by iterating this relation, it is easy to show that

(11)

gi

=

 

a(3i)+b(2i)+ci,

d

where a, b, c  Zd solve uniquely the linear system



 a =

+ c = .

Conversely, every vector of the form (11) has this specific automorphism. A vector g = (gi) satisfying (11) is what is known in the literature as an Alltop sequence. Such sequences were constructed by Alltop [2] for applications of spread spectrum radars and communication. By the

transformation rule of a phase quadratic symmetries, we have that

|ak, (g)| = |ak, -k(g)|,

which means that zero eigenvalues may be duplicated by the automorphism, giving some limitations on rank(G(g)).

14

ASSAF GOLDBERGER, SHUJIE KANG, AND KASSO A. OKOUDJOU

Assume now that d is prime and 1  a < d. Then the above symmetry implies that |ak, (g)| is independent of . In fact we can show

Proposition 4. (See [16, 19]) If 1  a < d, d is an odd prime, and g is as in (11), then



 1 |ak, (g)|2 = d

k>0

.

0 k = 0, > 0

In particular rank(G(g)) = d2 - d + 1. Moreover, the Gabor System {T M kg}d,-k=1 0, together with the standard basis is a maximal MUB of d + 1 bases.

Proof. We compute directly for k = 0:

|ak, (g)| =

This is a variant of the well-known Gauss sums [16, Theorem 1].

When

ak,

(g)

i i = 0 if

= 0. This in particular means that g is orthogonal

to M ig for all i, and moreover B0 := {M jg}j is an orthonormal basis. It follows that for every i,

Bi = {T iM jg}i is an orthonormal basis, and that the Gabor system is a MUB of d bases. Since

all entries of G(g) are of the same modulus, we can adjoin the standard basis to obtain a maximal

MUB.

We next construct another family of vectors g having a nontrivial automorphism group, and

leading to a non complete Gabor POVM with few distinct inner products. We consider the subspace of Cd given by

(12)

V(a, b, c, ) = {g  Cd : gi = a(2i)+bi+cgi}

for some integers a, b, c  Zd and   Z×d .

The group (Zd)× acts on the set Zd by multiplication. The subgroup  generated by  yields a disjoint decomposition of  - orbits

Zd = Qr.
r
For each r fix a point ir  Qr. Then the value gir determines uniquely the values of gi for all i  Qr. Namely, if i = mir, then by iterating the condition in (12) we get

(13)

gi =

Notice however, that this must apply to any index s such that sir  ir mod d. Hence if gir = 0, the following condition must hold

j

(14)

a + bj + c  0 mod d.

jQr

In this case, we say that Qr is an orientable  -orbit for the triple (a, b, c). Otherwise it is nonorientable. We have

Proposition 5. Using the above notations and definitions, the following statements hold.
(a) The dimension over C of the space V(a, b, c, ) is the number of orientable  -orbits for the triple (a, b, c).
(b) If d is odd and gcd(d, 2 - 1) = 1, then all the  -orbits are orientable for (a, b, c).

Proof. Let Q be the set of all  -orbits in Zd, and denote by N the number of orientable  -orbits.

(a) Pick an index ir  Qr for any orbit Qr  Q. We define a linear map E : V(a, b, c, )  CQ by sending g to the vector (gir )r. The map E is injective, because by (13) g is determined uniquely by the collection {gir }. Also, when (14) is not satisfied, then gir = 0, so we conclude that dim V(a, b, c, ) = dim Image(E)  N . To prove the equality, for every orientable orbit

Qr we will construct a vector g  V(a, b, c, ) with gir = 1 and gis = 0 for all s = i. We define gi for i  Qr by equation (13) taken with gir = 1, and for i / Qr we set gi = 0 for. Then condition (14) guarantees that g is well-defined, regardless of the choice of a lifting m  Z, and it is easy to check now that the condition in (12) is satisfied. Hence g  V(a, b, c, ),

and we are done proving (a).

(b) We must check condition (14). Since d is odd and hence 2 is invertible modulo d, it is enough
to prove that for each orbit Qr, jQr j2  jQr j  0 mod d. Since Qr = {tir | 0  t < s}, where sir = ir, then using gcd(d, 2 - 1) = 1:

where the quantities are considered as elements of Zd. A similar argument proves that jQr j  0 mod d.

Let g be a vector satisfying (12). By using (8) and (9) we have |ai,-1 | = |ai, -ai| for all (i, ), or equivalently

(15)

|ai, | = |a-1i, --1ai|.

Assume now the conditions of Proposition 5. Our next goal is to estimate the number distinct
angles associated with the Gabor system generated by a vector g that satisfies (12). Towards this we transform coordinates on (Zd)2 by i = i and = - 2a /(2 - 1). Write ai , (g) = ai , = ai, (g). Then (15) transforms to the simpler form

(16)

|ai, | = |a-1i, |.

16

ASSAF GOLDBERGER, SHUJIE KANG, AND KASSO A. OKOUDJOU

Recall that we also have the conjugacy symmetry |ai, | = |a-i,-l|. Equivalently,

(17)

|ai, | = |a-i,-l|.

Let B be the subgroup of Z×d generated by  and -1. Then (16)-(17) are equivalent to

(18)

|ai, | = |at-1i,t |, for all t  B.

The group B satisfies B =  or [B :  ] = 2.

Theorem 5. Suppose that d is odd and that gcd(2 - 1, d) = 1. Then the Gabor system G(g) is m-angular where

(19)

gcd((d1), (d2))  d  d .

r
d1,d2|d

d2

Here r = |B|, (di) is the order of the image of B in Z×di, and  is the Euler totient function.

Proof. The number of angles in this Gabor system is the number of distinct |ai, (g)|, which is the number of distinct |ai, (g)|. The group B acts on (Zd)2 via (i, )  (t-1i, t ) for all t  B, hence by (18) |ai, | are constant along the orbits. We will be done if we show that the right hand side of (19) is the number of B-orbits.
We note that if C is a finite group acting on a finite set S, and Fix(s) is the cardinality of the
stabilizer of the point s  S, then the number of orbits is sS 1/Fix(s). Let 0 be a generator for the cyclic group B, and consider a point (i, )  (Zd)2. Let d1 = gcd(i, d) and d2 = gcd( , d). Then 0 has multiplicative order (d1) modulo d1 and (d2) modulo d2. Thus 0(d1) is the stabilizer of i, and 0(d2) is the stabilizer of . It follows that Fix((i, )) = r/gcd((d1), (d2)). The number of the pairs (i, ) with gcd(i, d) = d1 and gcd( , d) = d2 is (d/d1)(d/d2). The theorem follows.

Corollary 1. Suppose that d is prime and  generates (Zd)×, or that d  3 mod 4 and  has order (d - 1)/2. Then, we have
 m  d + 2 rank(G(g))  d2 mod (d - 1).

Proof. In the both cases B = Z×d and r = d-1. The pair (d1, d2) takes the values (1, 1), (d, 1), (1, d), (d, d). We have (1) = 1 and (d) = d - 1. The right hand side of (19) is d + 2.
The second equation follows from the fact that all the non-trivial B-orbits of Z2d are of order d - 1.

We illustrate Corollary 1 with an example, namely the family of Gabor frames generated by the

Björck sequences. Suppose d is an odd prime, and denote [k] 

k d

the Legndre symbol. We can

define a vector in Cd accordingly as following:

Björck sequences, which were constructed in [9] are CAZAC (Constant Amplitude Zero Auto Correlation) sequences, meaning that g, T g = 0 for all  Z×d . For this reason, they provide examples of vectors g  Cd with g 0 = d and do not generate IC-POVMs. In fact, the number
of different values in the Gramian G(g) is relatively small. When d  3 mod 4, we know that rank(G(g))  d2 - 2d + 2 by the result in [7] and the following observation.

Proposition 6. Suppose d is prime and d  3 mod 4 and g is a unit vector in Cd, then | g, M kT g | take d + 1 different values. Furthermore, | g, M kT g | = | g, M k T g | if k  k mod d and
(k, ), (k , ) = (0, 0).

Note that by Corollary 1, the upper bound of the number of angles is d + 2. Under the specific choice of of the phase , the values of a0, and a ,0, = 0 all degenerate to 0. General choices of  will result in d + 2 angles.

We conclude this section by showing that rank(G(g)) cannot lie in the interval (d, 2d) when d is odd and prime. We contrast this with Proposition 3 where we gave an example of g leading to rank(G(g)) = 3d/2 for d even. But first, we need the following Lemma.

18

ASSAF GOLDBERGER, SHUJIE KANG, AND KASSO A. OKOUDJOU

Lemma 2. Assume that d is an odd prime. If g 0 > d/2 and rank(G(g)) = d, then rank(G(g))  2d.

Proof. The assumption g 0 > d/2 implies that the vector wk := (gig¯i+k)i is not the zero vector for all k. Hence for each k, ak, = 0 for at least one . Suppose by contradiction that rank(G(g)) < 2d. Therefore, we must have some value of k for which ak, = 0 for exactly one . In particular wk is proportional to (1,  , 2 , . . . , (d-1) ). There are two cases to consider:
 Case I: k = 0. Then w0 = (1, 1, . . . , 1)/ d. There must be some k = 0 for which ak , = 0 for at
most two valuesof . Thus wk equals to a vector (aim +bin)i, for some constants a, b. But as |(wk )i| = 1/ d for all i, |aim + bin| is independent of i, which implies a = 0 or b = 0. WLOG b = 0. Thus gi/gi+k = daim. Modifying g by multiplicative transformation, and using gcd(k , d) = 1, we may assume that k = 1, which implies that gi = g0(da)imi(i-1)/2. Substituting i = d we obtain (da)d = 1, hence da = r for some r. Thus g is a quadratic transformation of (1, 1, . . . , 1)/ d and rank(G(g)) = d. A contradiction.
Case II: k = 0. Since gcd(k, d) = 1, then by modifying g be a multiplicative transformation we may assume that k = 1, and gig¯i+1 = c i. By a phase quadratic transformation, we may reduce to the case = 0, so gig¯i+1 = c for all i. Dividing this by g¯i+1gi+2 = c¯we obtain gi/gi+2 = c/c¯. This implies that |gi| = |gi+2| for all i and as d is odd, |gi| = 1/ d for all i and from this point the proof is identical to case I.

Remark. It follows that for d = 3 there is no g with rank(G(g)) = 5. If this was not the case, the generator g would satisfy g 0 = 1, but this in turn implies rank(G(g)) = 3, a contradiction.
We need introduce a definition and a preliminary result that is interesting in its own right.

Definition 1. The density  = (f ) of a polynomial f (X)  F [X] over a field F is the number of nonzero coefficients in f .

We denote µd the group of complex roots of unity of order d. The main part of the proof lies in the following result.

Proposition 7. Let d be a prime integer and f (X)  C[X] a polynomial of degree less than d. Then the number of roots of f which are in µd is at most (f ) - 1.

Proof. The result is an immediate consequence of the fact that all minors of d × d DFT matrix are

nonzero when d is prime, see [14, Theorem 6] or [13, Theorem 4]. Nonetheless, we provide here an

algebraic number field argument.

Suppose, by contradiction, that the polynomial f has at least (f ) roots in µd. Pick (f ) roots,

i = ei, 0  i < (f ). Let h =

(h)-1 j=0

cj

X

hj

be

the

polynomial

of

degree

less

than

d,

with

the

smallest possible density ( (f )) having all the i as roots.

Then the coefficients of h are solution to a linear system of equations given by the vectors
vj := (eihj )i  µd(f), 0  j  (h) - 1. By the assumption on h, this is the minimal linear dependency. The rank of the matrix V = (eihj )i,j is (h) - 1, thus there are (h) - 1 independent

rows, and the linear dependency coefficients can be read from the (h) - 1 size minors belonging to

TOWARDS A CLASSIFICATION OF INCOMPLETE GABOR POVMS IN Cd

19

the submatrix corresponding to these rows. In particular the coefficients belong to the cyclotomic field K := Q() and h is proportional to a polynomial in K[X]. WLOG we assume that h  K[X].

The maximal order of K is known to be the ring Z[], and by again rescaling h we may assume that h  Z[][X]. There is a ring homomorphism  : Z[]  Zd. The kernel of  is the unique prime ideal D above d, which is known to be principal, and generated by  - 1. We extend  to a ring homomorphism (denoted again by )  : Z[][X]  Zd[X]. Let vD(z) denote the D-adic valuation of z  K, and let vD(h) = mini vD(ci). Then replacing h by h/( - 1)vD(h), we still have h  Z[][X], and at least on ci / D. In particular (h) = 0.

Now, h(X) = h0(X) i(X - i), and still h0(X)  Z[][X]. This can be proved by induction by dividing g(X) successively by each (X - i). For example, in the first step write h(X) = h(X - 0 + 0) and expand each monomial around X - 0 using the binomial formula.
On applying  we obtain (h)(X) = (X - 1)(f)(h0)(X).
In particular, all first (h)  (f ) derivatives of (h) vanish at X = 1:

(h)(k)(X = 1) = cihi(hi - 1) · · · (hi - k + 1) = 0 mod d, k < (h).
i
Hence, since not all ci are 0 mod d, the matrix W = hi(hi - 1) · · · (hi - k + 1) i,k  (Zd)(h),(h) has linearly dependent rows. Notice that the kth column of W are the values of polynomial Fk(X) = X(X - 1) · · · (X - k + 1) substituted at X = hi. Thus by performing column elementary operations on W , we may clear the lower terms in Fk(X), and our matrix is Gauss equivalent to the matrix U = (hki )i,k. But 0  hi < d are distinct and U is the Vandermonde matrix in the field Zd, hence det(W ) = det(U ) = 0 in Zd. This is a contradiction, and the theorem is proved.

We are now ready to prove:

Theorem 6. For an odd prime d, there is no unit vector g with d < rank(G(g)) < 2d.

Proof. Suppose that there is such g. We know by Lemma 2 that g 0 < d/2. Then for each k, wk 0 < d/2. Suppose that k is taken such that wk = 0. By the above theorem, the DFT wk can
have at most (d - 3)/2 zero entries, hence the number of such that ak, (g) = 0 is at least (d + 3)/2. This implies that there can be at most 3 values of k such that wk = 0. This implies in turn that
g 0  2. But in this case the conclusion of the theorem follows from Proposition 3.

We conclude the paper by proving the rank of Gabor POVMs in dimensions 4 and 5 when the generator g does not have full support.

Proposition 8. Suppose that g is a unit-norm vector. The following statements hold.

(i) If g  C4, then

if g 0 = 1





rank(G(g)) = 4, 6, 8, 11, or 12

if g 0 = 2

 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16 if g 0 = 3

(ii) If g  C5, then



5

if g 0 = 1





rank(G(g)) = 15

if g 0 = 2

 21, 23, or 25 if g 0 = 3

Proof. The result for g 0 = 1, 2 can be obtained form Theorem 4 and Proposition 3.
(i) Assume now g 0 = 3. Without loss of generality, let g0, g1, g2 = 0 and g3 = 0. We have w^0 0 =3 or 4, w^1 0 = w^3 0 =3 or 4, and w^2 0 =2 or 4. · w^0 0 = 3 if |g0|2 + |g2|2 = |g1|2, else w^0 0 = 4. · w^2 0 = 2 if g0g¯2 = ±g2g¯0, else w^2 0 = 4. · w^1 0 = w^3 0 = 3 if g0g¯1 + kg1g¯2 = 0 for some k  Z4, else w^1 0 = w^3 0 = 4.
Since all possible combinations of (||w^0||0, ||w^1||0, w^2 0) can be obtained, we can conclude that rank(G(g)) can be any integer between 11 and 16. (ii) Next, suppose g 0 = 3. We assume g0, g1, g2 = 0. All other possibilities can be obtained from additive and multiplicative translation from this vector. Then

w0 0 = 3, w1 0 = w4 0 = 2, and w2 0 = w3 0 = 1.

So w^0 0 = 3 or 5; w^2 0 = w^3 0 = 5; and w^1 0 = w^4 0 =4 or 5.

· w^0 0 = 3 if w0 = (1, -2 cos(4/5), 1, 0, 0). Then g is equivalent to

(1, -2 cos(4/5))ei1, ei2, 0, 0) for 1, 2  [0, 2]. Otherwise w^0 0 = 5.

Since all combinations of the pair (||w^0||0, ||w^1||0) can be obtained, we have rank(G(g)) =21,

23 or 25.
