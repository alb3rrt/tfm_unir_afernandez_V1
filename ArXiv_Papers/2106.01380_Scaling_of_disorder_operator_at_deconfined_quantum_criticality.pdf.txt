We study the scaling behavior of the disorder parameter, defined as the expectation value of a symmetry transformation applied to a finite region, at the deconfined quantum critical point in (2+1) in the -3 model via large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the disorder parameter for U(1) spin rotation symmetry exhibits perimeter scaling with a logarithmic correction associated with sharp corners of the region, as generally expected for a conformally-invariant critical point. However, for large rotation angle the universal coefficient of the logarithmic corner correction becomes negative, which is not allowed in any unitary conformal field theory. We also extract the current central charge from the small rotation angle scaling, whose value is much smaller than that of the free theory.

Introduction.-Deconfined quantum criticality (DQC) [1­3], a continuous quantum phase transition between two seemingly unrelated symmetry-breaking states, is arguably the enigma of novel quantum critical point beyond the paradigm of LandauGinzburg-Wilson. Such a transition, if exists, is believed to host a number of unusual phenomena, such as an emergent symmetry unifying order parameters of completely different microscopic origins and the presence of fractionalized spinons, among others [3­5]. Theoretically the proposed low-energy theory is a gauge theory in the strong coupling regime, posing significant challenges to analytical treatment [2, 6]. Numerical investigations of lattice models realizing such transitions have been indispensable in pushing forward our understanding of DQC from many different angles: the two-length-scale scaling as an attempt to reconcile the anomalous finite-size scaling behavior of the J-Q model [7], conserved current exploited to exhibit the emergent continuous symmetry [8], fractionalization revealed from dynamic spin spectra [3], to name a few. There has also been exiciting progress in possible experimental realization of the DQC from the pressure-driven phase transition in the Shastry-Sutherland quantum magnet SrCu2(BO3)2 [9, 10] and its theoretical implications [11­13]. The communities of quantum phase transitions, quantum magnetism and even high-energy physics, have benefited a lot from these pursuits over the years. However, the very nature of the transition itself, and basic questions such as whether the transition is continuous or not, whether the transition follows conformal invariance and accquires a proper conformal field theory (CFT) description [6, 14­17], etc, are actually still open despite the active investigations mentioned above.
In recent years, the importance of using extended operators, such as symmetry domain walls or field lines of emergent gauge field, to probe and characterize phases and phase transitions has become increasingly clear [18­22]. In particular, many exotic gapped phases can be understood in terms of the condensation of certain extended objects, spontaneously breaking the so-called higher-form symmetry. These new insights bring intriguing connections between the Landau-

Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking and more exotic phenomena of topological order [23]. Inspired by such progress, recent works have started to explore more quantitative aspects of disorder operators, which is defined as a symmetry transformation restricted to a finite region of the system, especially at quantum criticality. Ref. [24] computed the Ising disorder operator, which serves as the order parameter of a Z2 1-form symmetry, by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation at the (2+1) Ising transition. U(1) disorder operator at the (2+1) XY transition is measured in QMC simulation as well [25]. New universal scaling behavior for such disorder operators at these conformally-invariant quantum critical points (QCP) are identified. Building upon the methodology for the computation and analysis of disorder operator established by studying conventional symmetrybreaking transitions, in this work we take this new set of tools to study the deconfined quantum criticality.
An important difference between the DQC and other QCPs studied so far in this context is that one side of DQC exhibits the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) order, spontaneously breaking the lattice symmetry. To understand how the behavior of disorder operator is affected by lattice symmetry breaking, we first study two different microscopic realizations of the (2+1) O(3) QCP, the bilayer and 1-2 Heisenberg antiferromagnets on square lattice, using QMC simulations. We find the disorder operators for U(1) symmetry obey the expected perimeter law scaling with a multiplicative logarithmic correction at the QCPs, in agreement with the prediction of the O(3) CFT. However for the 1-2 model with explicit translation symmetry breaking, it is crucial to construct disorder operators only on regions whose boundary avoids the "strong" singlet bonds, in order to obtain converged results in the finite-size analysis.
With this knowledge, we proceed with the similar measurement of the U(1) disorder operator in the -3 model of DQC, at the critical point between the Néel and VBS phases [4]. To have controlled results, we employ a small pinning field of the VBS order and follow the same prescription for the construction of disorder operator established in

2

the study of the 1-2 model. Our converged data reveal that although the disorder operator still obeys the scaling behavior expected for a general CFT, the universal coefficient in the logarithmic correction term becomes negative for U(1) rotation angle close to , which we argue is incompatible with any unitary CFT. We also extract the current central charge from the small angle scaling, whose value is significantly smaller than conventional O() CFT.

FIG. 1. The three lattice models: (a) the bilayer square lattice antifer-
romagnetic Heisenberg model, (b) the square lattice 1-2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and (c) the -3 model. (a), (b) exhibits (2 + 1) O(3) QCP as 2/1 is tuned [26­28] and (c) gives rise to DQC [4].

Three lattice models.- We simulate the following three lattice models hosting the target QCPs. The first is the bilayer square lattice antiferromagnet with Hamiltonian





bilayer = 1 (S1, · S1,  + S2, · S2,  ) + 2 S1, · S2,, (1)





where S, is a spin-1/2 at site  of layer (= 1, 2),   denotes the neareast-neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling on the square lattice. 2 is the interlayer antiferromagnetic interaction. The model is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The critical point (2/1) = 2.5220(1) [26, 27] separating the Néel state and the symmetric product state of inter-layer singlets, belongs to the (2 + 1) O(3) universality class.
The next model is the square lattice 1-2 Heisenberg, shown in Fig. 1(b). The Hamiltonian reads





1-2 = 1 S · S  + 2 S · S  ,

(2)





where   denotes the thin 1 bond and   denotes the thick 2 bond, and the QCP (2/1) = 1.90951(1) [28] is also known to fall within the (2 + 1) O(3) universality class. The reason that we study both Eqs. (1) and (2) is that although the QCPs are in the same universality class, the presence of strong 2 and weak 1 bonds in Eq. (2) breaks the lattice translation symmetry while Eq. (1) is fully translation-invariant. As we show below, because of the translation symmetry breaking, the domain  must be chosen so that its boundary avoids strong singlet bonds to correctly extract the scaling behavior of the disorder operator.
The last model is the -3 model as illustrated in Fig. 1(c) with the following Hamiltonian,





 -3 = -   - 

   . (3)



 

Here

is

the two-spin singlet projector.

The

quantum critical point separating the Néel and VBS states is

at [/( + )] = 0.59864(4) [4, 7]. While the VBS order

vanishes at the QCP after extrapolating to the thermodynamic

limit, in a finite system there is always a small but non-zero

VBS order. Therefore the computation of the disorder param-

eter may suffer from similar kinds of lattice effect that occurs

in the 1-2 model. To eliminate such effect as much as possi-

ble, we follow the same procedure used to extract the universal

scaling for the disorder parameter in the 1-2 case, to achieve

robustly converged results from finite-size analysis.

Disorder operator.- All three lattice models have SU(2) spin

rotational symmetry. For any U(1) subgroup we will define

a disorder operator that depends on the U(1) rotation angle.

Without loss of generality, we will consider spin rotations

around the  and the U(1) symmetry transformations are im-

plemented by  () =

)

,

where

the

U(1)

charge on site . For a region , we define the disorder oper-

ator  () =







(





-

)

.

The

ground

state

expectation

value  () will be referred to as the disorder parameter.

The scaling behavior of  () in various phases, especially

the dependence on the geometry of , has been studied thor-

oughly in Ref. [25]. In a U(1)-symmetric phase, such as the

singlet ground state in bilayer and 1-2 models,  () is expected to obey a perimeter law |  () |  -1 ( ), where

 is the perimeter of the region . In the ordered (U(1) sym-

metry breaking) phases, such as the Néel phase of the three models, it was found that |  () |  -( ) ln  [25, 29].

Our focus in this work, however, is the disorder operator at

QCPs in Fig. 1, in particular that of the DQC. Previous studies

of the (2 + 1) Ising and O(2) transitions, as well as other gap-

less critical theories [24, 25, 30, 31] suggest that ln |  () |

takes the following general form for a rectangle region:

ln |  () | = -1 +  ln  + 0.

(4)

Here all the coefficients are functions of . The universal logarithmic correction, which translates into a power law  in |  |, originates from sharp corners of the region. In general  is a universal function of both  and the opening angle(s) of

3

the corners (all /2 in this case) [25, 32]. Similar corner con-

tributions were known to arise for Rényi entropy in a CFT [33],

which can be understood as the disorder operator of the replica

symmetry. In Ref. [25], analytical arguments were presented

to support the universal corner correction for the disorder op-

erator and the universal coefficient  is found to be given by

This

the

conse-

quence of conformal symmetry and current conservation. Our

previous QMC at O(2) QCP reveals /2 = 0.011(1), consis-

tent with the exact value

 (4)2

= 0.01145 [35­38].

Another

feature common to all known examples of disorder operators

is that  is always positive. The positivity of  is proven for the

Rényi entropy, i.e. disorder parameter of the replica symmetry

in unitary CFTs [39, 40]. In the present case, we generalize

the argument in Ref. [39] to show that () must be positive in

a unitary CFT (see Supplemental Materials (SM) for details).

As we will see below, () for DQC follows the same scaling

behavior at small , but the large  behavior is dramatically

different.

clear from the figures.

Numerical Results.- We choose the region  to be a  ×  square region in the lattice, with perimeter  = 4 - 4. Firstly, we compute the disorder parameter  () as a function of perimeter  at the 3D O(3) QCP ((2/1) = 2.5220) [26, 27] of the bilayer model with system size  = 32, 64, 96, 128. Plots of |  () | v.s.  for representative values of 's are

shown in Fig. 2(a). Fitting the data with Eq. (4), we obtain

the coefficient () of the corner correction term, as shown in

Fig. 2 (b). The behavior of  is qualitatively similar to that of

the O(2) transition studied in Ref. [25]. We will mainly use

the results from bilayer as a reference for the O(3) CFT.

Next, we perform the same QMC simulations for the 1-2 model at its QCP (2/1) = 1.90951(1) [28]. Although

the critical theory is the same 3D O(3) CFT, because of the

doubling of the unit cell due to alternating 1 and 2 bonds, the disorder parameter  () exhibits even-odd oscillation

as a function of , see SM for details. This is because the

boundary of the region  cuts different types of bonds for even

and odd : for odd , one of the boundary segments along 

always cuts strong 2 bonds, while for even  depending on the

exact position of  the boundary may or may not cut strong

bonds. Such singlet cutting increases the leading perimeter

contribution in the disorder parameter, introducing significant

finite-size error when extracting the subleading corner term

. For the 1-2 model, we find that the correct results for () (compared to () extracted from the bilayer Heisenberg

model, free of such complications) can only be obtained from

the scaling analysis when disorder operators are constructed on

regions whose boundary does not cut any strong bonds. More

details of the analysis can be found in the SM. We believe

this is a general phenomenon and to mitigate finite-size error

similar selection of regions must be applied whenever there

exists bond order breaking the translation symmetry either

explicitly or spontaneously. This is the most important lesson

learnt from the study of the 1-2 model.

Now we turn to the -3 model. Because of the VBS order,

we would like to design the boundary of  in such a way that

it does not cut any strong singlet bonds. However, since the

VBS order in the -3 model forms spontaneously, the pattern

of stronger singlet bonds is not known a priori. To resolve this

issue, we employ a small pinning field to lock the VBS order

into a particular pattern, e.g. the singlet bonds are oriented

along the -direction similar to those in the 1-2 model, as

illustrated in Fig. 1 (b). This is achieved by strengthening the

Heisenberg couplings on the 2 bonds. To make sure that the

quantum criticaility is not spoiled by the explicit breaking of

the symmetry, we purposefully choose the strength of the field

to scale with 1/ with a small coefficient , i.e.

2

=

+

,


such that when extrapolating to the thermodynamic limit, the

simulated Hamiltonian goes back to the original -3 with only spontaneous symmetry breaking. We find the value of

 = 0.05 gives the most robust and well-converged results

of  , as shown in Fig. 2 (e) and (f). Hence all results

reported below are obtained with such a pinning field. Similar

type of pinning has also been shown to work in other difficult

QCPs [41, 42].

Let us start from small . In Fig. 3, we show the fit of the cor-

ner correction ()

For the bilayer and 1-2 Heisenberg models, we obtain  /(4)2 = 0.0120(2) and  /(4)2 = 0.0116(2), respec-

tively. These values are consistent with  /(4)2 = 0.01147

tion of the obtained  /(4)2 as the system size  increases. In case

rorbars. However, as shown in Fig. 3 (e) and (f), the same analysis for the DQC yields a much smaller value  /(4)2 = 0.0028(2), roughly one quarter of that of the O() CFTs. A small  , or equivalently a small DC conductivity , suggests that the theory is strongly coupled (so the value deviates significantly from that of a free boson).
Most interestingly, we find that the () for DQC becomes negative for large  as shown in Fig. 2 (f). We also note that () converges quite well as the system size increases up to  = 128. Such negative values of () in DQC are drastically different from the behavior of  observed in all other QCPs investigated so far, including Ising [24], O(2) [25] and also the two different realizations of the O(3) CFT in Fig. 2 (b) and (d). This list can be expanded to include Rényi entanglement entropy as a disorder parameter of the replica symmetry, and it is known that the corner correction  for Rényi entropies must be positive for all unitary CFTs [39, 40]. In fact, we can generalize the argument in Ref. [39] to show that ( = ) > 0 (essentially for any Z2 symmetry disorder parameter, see SM for details). Therefore a negative  implies strong deviation of the model from unitary CFTs. This is intriguing as measurements of local observables at DQC in the -3 model appear to exhibit conformal invariance, at least for system sizes accessible to current numerical simulations. Thus our observation of a negative () provides direct evidence for the breakdown

of a unitary CFT description. Discussions.- Through large-scale QMC simulations and
finite-size analyses, we determine the scaling behavior of the disorder operator for U(1) symmetry at the DQCP in the -3 model. Most noticeably, the universal corner correction  of the DQC becomes negative, in sharp contradiction to the positivity of () in any unitary relativistic conformal field theory. We also observe that the obtained current central charge of DQC is much smaller than the typical value of O() CFTs, suggesting possible fractionalization of the charge carriers at DQC.
Our findings, in particularly the negative , raise a number of significant questions about the theory of DQC. One possible explanation for the negative  is that the observed regime of the DQC is actually controlled by a non-unitary CFT, with a (complex) fixed point very close to the physical parameter space. So within a large length scale conformal invariance can still manifest. This possibility has been proposed theoretically in several recent works [6, 15­17], to explain unusual finite-size scaling behavior from previous numerical simulations [6, 7, 14] and the tension between the numerically observed critical exponents with conformal bootstrap bounds. Our result points to a distinct aspect of this putative non-unitary fixed point, that the universal correction  must be negative. On the other hand, it is also important to understand how the two-length-scale scaling [7], and theoretically the existence of a dangerously irrelevant operator due to the breaking of the emergent symmetry by lattice effect, affect the behavior of the disorder operator. It will be interesting for future studies to explore other non-local observables, such as Rényi entropies, and consider other microscopic realizations of DQC where dangerously irrelevant operators are absent [44]. In summary, our results unambiguously reveal fundamental differences between DQC and QCPs described by unitary CFTs, sheding new lights on the nature of DQC.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
The choice of region 
In this section, we dicuss how to choose the region  to obtain the correct scaling behavior of  . As shown in the main text, for bilayer, since there is no translation symmetry breaking (explicit or spontaneous), the choice of the region is immaterial. However, the 1 - 2 case is different because the alternating strenghs of Heisenberg couplings doubles the unit cell, as shown in Fig. S4. If the region  is a  ×  square (green shaded region in Fig. S4),  with even or odd  cut very different types of bonds on the boundary.

FIG. S4. Three types of region : (a) region  with odd (= 3), whose boundary cuts one column of strong singlet bonds; (b) region  with even (= 4) and cutting two columns of strong singlet bonds; (c) region  with even (= 4) and cutting no strong singlet bonds.

More concretely, when  is odd (e.g.  = 3 in Fig. S4 (a)), the boundary of  inevitably cuts one column of 2 bonds. When

 is even, as shown in Fig. S4 (b) and (c), depending on the exact location of , the boundary can cut two columns of 2 bonds

(as in (b)) or avoid cutting 2 bonds at all (as in (c)). Numerically, we find that the three choices of  yield distinct values

and scaling behavior of the disorder parameter  . Only for those regions cutting no 2 bonds, finite-size scaling analysis

converges to the expected result for the (2+1) O(3) CFT. The issue can be clearly seen from the representative data in Fig. S5.

Fig. S5 (a) shows the |  () | at  = /2 for  = 96 at the QCP of 1-2 . Disorder parameters corresponding to three different boundaries as illustrated in Fig. S4 (a), (b) and (c), denoted as odd, even-A and even-B in the figure all show different perimeter

dependence. Even-A type boundaries show the largest linear coefficient in the perimeter contribution, which makes sense as

this type of boundary cuts the most 2 bonds. While the perimeter law is non-universal, the dependence on the details of the

boundary also manifests in the corner correction, at least in our finite-size analysis. The problem is clearly illustrated in Fig. S5

(b), where () extracted from the disorder parameters computed using the three types of boundaries are shown for system size

 = 96. Here one sees that  for Even-A boundary becomes negative, which violates the positivity constraint at  =  and is

obviously unphysical. We believe that the relatively large perimeter contribution for Even-A boundary data strongly affects the

precision of the fitting, since the corner contribution is subleading to the perimeter term. For the other two types of boundaries

(Odd and Even-B), now both give positive (), but the  dependence is still quite different. We find it is the Even-B type regions

that give the correct value of the current central charge of the O(3) CFT, from fitting ()

.

This analysis suggests

that to mitigate the finite-size error in the data fitting, one should construct disorder operators on regions which minimize the

perimeter contribution. In particular, when there is lattice symmetry breaking induced by "bond" order, the strong bonds should

be avoided.

In case of the DQC, although -3 is translation-invariant, it is already well-known that finite-size analysis of correlations can be tricky due to the domains of VBS formed spontanenously when   . For disorder operator, boundary dependence similar to those observed in the 1 - 2 model also shows up in the naive measurements of  at DQC. To minimize the effect of cutting strong bonds due to residual VBS order, we add a small pinning field to the Heisenberg term following the same pattern in the 1-2 model, with 1 =  and 2 =  + /. In this way, the VBS can be weakly pinned by the 2 term but the order vanishes as   . With such a setup, we then measure the  with even-B type boundary as in Fig. S4 (c). A
comparison of measurements with three different boundaries is given in Fig. S6. We find that this method achieves the most
robust convergence of  at DQC, as shown in the main text.

POSITIVITY CONSTRAINT ON Z2 DISORDER PARAMETER

In Ref. [39] it was shown that in a general unitary quantum field theory (QFT), Rényi entropies satisfy the following inequality:

Here ,  = 1, . . . ,  is a collection of (codimension-1) regions in the half space of positive Euclidean time, and ¯  is the

Euclidean time-reflected regions corresponding to   .

We now

prove a similar inequality for

Z2

disorder operator.

Suppose that

and

therefore  is hermitian), which is represented by a topological surface operator in the Euclidean spacetime. The disorder

parameter for a region  is then given by the (suitably normalized) path integral with an insertion of an open surface operator

 , which is just  restricted on . Following Ref. [39], we split the path integral for positive and negative Euclidean time. Consider a family of  in the positive Euclidean time half-space, and write ± for fields restricted to positive and negative

Euclidean time. We have

Here the subscript  indicates insertions of the corresponding open surface operators in the path integral. Equivalently,

If the action has the time-reflection symmetry S [(, x)] = S [(-, x)], together with the hermiticity of the inserted operator, a change of variables (, x)  (-, x) in the path integral proves that the two terms in the brackets are complex conjugate of each other, and the result is positive. Since 's are arbitrary complex numbers, the condition is equivalent to

det

 0.

(S3)

In the following we will write  = -() ( not to be confused with the entropy or the action S in the path integral). In a CFT in (2+1)d, () should take the following form:

() = 1|  | -  ln  + 0 +   .

(S4)





Here   denotes the boundary of , and |  | is the perimeter of the region.  is the linear size of  and  is a short-distance cut-off.  is the sum of universal constants for each sharp corner of the region.
When  = 2, denote the two regions by  and , the inequality reduces to

2(   ¯)  (   ¯) + (  ¯).

(S5)

Now we choose the two regions  and  as shown in Fig. S7. The region   ¯ has two sharp corners with the same opening angles , while   ¯ has two corners with opening angles 2 - . It can be easily checked that

| (   ¯ | + | (  ¯)| = 2| (   ¯)|,

(S6)

where | ()| is the perimeter of the region . Thus the perimeter terms in  all cancel out. We then note that   ¯ has a smooth boundary with no corners. Notice that  and  can be considered to have the same linear size . So in order for the inequality to hold for arbitrary linear size of the region, generally we must have





- 2() ln - 2(2 - ) ln + const.  0.

(S7)





It is not difficult to show that () = (2 - ), therefore in order to satisfy Eq. (S7) for arbitrarily large , () must be positive. A slight generalization of the argument, with  having opening angle  instead of 2 - , gives

() + ()  2

Together with ( = ) = 0 we can see that () is a non-negative, decreasing and convex function of  for 0    . Similar conclusions for Rényi entropies were obtained in Ref. [40].
