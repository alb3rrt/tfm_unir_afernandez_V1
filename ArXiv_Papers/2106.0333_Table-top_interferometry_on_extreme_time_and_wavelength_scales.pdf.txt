ABSTRACT
High-resolution Fourier-transform spectroscopy using table-top sources in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range is still in its infancy. In this contribution a significant advance is presented based on a Michelson-type all-reflective split-and-delay autocorrelator operating in a quasi amplitude splitting mode. The autocorrelator works under a grazing incidence angle in a broad spectral range (10 nm - 1 µm) providing collinear propagation of both pulse replicas and thus a constant phase difference across the beam profile. The compact instrument allows for XUV pulse autocorrelation measurements in the time domain with a single-digit attosecond precision resulting in a resolution of E/E = 2000. Its performance for spectroscopic applications is demonstrated by characterizing a very sharp electronic transition at 26.6 eV in Ar gas induced by the 11th harmonic of a frequency-doubled Yb-fiber laser leading to the characteristic 3s3p64p1P1 Fano-resonance of Ar atoms. We benchmark our time-domain interferometry results with a high-resolution XUV grating spectrometer and find an excellent agreement. The common-path interferometer opens up new opportunities for short-wavelength femtosecond and attosecond pulse metrology and dynamic studies on extreme time scales in various research fields.
Introduction
The study of intense laser field interaction with atoms at optical and near-infrared frequencies has enabled the groundbreaking discovery of high-harmonic generation (HHG)1,2. The laser-driven ionization, electron propagation and recollision processes3,4 lead to the observation of the shortest coherent laser pulses in the XUV spectral range available to date, namely the emission of attosecond light bursts with a temporal width below 50 as5. Attosecond science and technology have opened many new perspectives for application of ultrashort XUV radiation to spectroscopy and imaging on the laboratory scale6. Meanwhile the physics of the HHG process has been studied in great detail also for other than atomic targets ranging from molecular7 to complex solid-state systems8 driven by a variety of laser waveforms covering from the ultraviolet (UV)9 and vacuum UV10 down to the THz spectral range11. Research and development towards optimizing the beam parameters of the photon sources are the key to unravel a plethora of fundamental dynamic processes and monitor them on the nanoscale12.
In recent years, interferometric methods that are standard tools to access the relative phases and amplitudes of interfering waves in optics, have extended to track propagating quantum objects such as charge or spin waves in matter on these extremely short distances and corresponding ultrafast time scales13. Along these lines, phase-sensitive lightwave metrology in time and frequency domain goes hand-in-hand with advanced coherent spectroscopy and imaging applications using electrons, ions or photons as observable. Experimental breakthroughs such as watching real-time electronic wave packet dynamics in atoms14, orbital tomography in molecules15 and optical coherence tomography of solids16, rely on controlling or detecting the phase of an electromagnetic wave with high precision17,18.
In typical spectroscopic studies, the signal intensity is recorded while the phase information is lost. High-resolution XUV spectrometers provide a resolution (E/E), which depends on the diffraction grating period, i. e. the number of illuminated groves and on the wavelength of the light. Typically, it is on the order of E/E = 10319. An alternative approach is Fourier-

transform (FT) spectroscopy. By its nature it enables characterization of radiation in both time and frequency domain using a single instrument. The spectral resolution of such a system depends on the maximum optical-path difference between replicas of the beam propagating in both interferometer arms20. Thus, it can exceed the spectral resolution of the grating-based analyzers by orders of magnitude21. Moreover, the resolution is uniform across the entire photon energy range, which usually is not the case for grating-based spectrometers.
The standard geometry of FT spectrometers employ the typical Michelson interferometer beampath. Its essential component is a beamsplitter, which permits for splitting the field amplitude of the incoming laser pulse in two identical parts propagating along two perpendicular interferometer arms. Combining the two replicas with parallel wavefronts on the detector maximizes the interference contrast. The transfer of the two-arm concept into the short wavelength range has been demonstrated for specific wavelengths based on multilayer optics22,23. The main challenge for performing FT spectroscopy in the XUV and beyond is, however, the design of a beamsplitter covering a broad spectral range, reaching high transmission and maintaining a plane wavefront. To meet these challenges, alternative schemes have been developed in recent years based on either engineering two source points in close proximity with variable pulse delay or special split-and-delay units, applied to a single radiation source. In the former scheme, two mutually coherent XUV pulses separated in space and time can be generated by harmonic generation from two laser pulses focused into a gas jet with the same separation24≠26. The latter concept is based on a conventional half-mirror split-and-delay unit27,28. Both approaches have already been employed to characterize HHG pulse trains in time and frequency domain26,29 and for spectroscopy at large scale synchrotron radiation facilities21. The major drawback of these concepts is that the two XUV pulses do not propagate collinearly. Due to the partial overlap in the far fied, only a small fraction of the lateral beam profile can be used to evaluate the interference signal. Because the pulses interfere at small skew angles, the phase between beams changes continuously along the intersection path. Consequently, the interference contrast in these non-collinear geometries is much weaker than in Michelson-type interferometers.
In this contribution we demonstrate FT spectroscopy in the XUV spectral range by employing a recently developed Michelson-type all-reflective split-and-delay autocorrelator design30. The instrument is based on two interleaved lamellar mirrors, which generate two replicas of XUV pulses propagating collinearly. It enables quasi amplitude division and resolves interferometric autocorrelation signals with maximum contrast.
Experimental setup
The experiment utilizes a table-top high harmonic source driven by Yb-fiber-laser technology and delivering short pulses with high photon flux in the XUV. Such sources can provide significantly higher repetition rates than the currently operating free-electron lasers based on superconducting linear accelerators31 and offer very high temporal resolution due to the intrinsically small timing jitter32. Here we use a high harmonic source, which is conceptually similar to the one presented in33, but operating at a reduced repetition rate of 100 kHz. A 20 W average power Yb-fiber laser providing 250 fs pulses at 1030 nm is frequency doubled in a 1 mm thick BBO crystal. The resulting 200 fs, 515 nm pulses at 10 W average power are post compressed to sub-20 fs using a nonlinear hollow core fiber with a subsequent chirped mirror compressor. High harmonic generation is driven by focusing these pulses to a spot size of 90 µm into an Ar gas jet resulting in a generated photon flux of  2 ∑ 1015 photons/s in the 11th harmonic (H11) at 26.5 eV photon energy. Subsequently, separation of the driving laser and the generated XUV radiation is achieved using two gracing incidence plates34, with an XUV reflectivity of 55% each, and additional 200 nm thick aluminum filters with a measured XUV transmission of 20%35. Spatial and spectral characterization of the generated XUV radiation is performed by using the 90-reflection of a removable 1 µm aluminum foil by means of a flat field grating spectrometer equipped with a CCD camera.
Fig. 1 shows a schematic overview of the optical beam passing the FT instrument. The key element is the split-and-delay unit (SDU). It consists of two interleaved lamellar mirrors splitting the wavefront of the incoming XUV pulse uniformly across the beam profile. The special mirror assembly is cut from a Si wafer and is coated with a 30 nm thick nickel layer. Its period is d = 250 µm. The mechanical stability of the SDU is essential for interferometry at short wavelengths. In order to measure a high-quality interferogram of H11 at  = 46.8 nm the relative position of the reflective elements should be known to a precision better than  10 nm, i.e.   /4. This is on the order of the background vibration in the laboratory, which is typically monitored during the measurements. The position of the reflective lamellar surface in the movable interferometer arm is controlled by 3-axes piezo-driven motors with nanometer, i.e. single-digit attosecond, precision. Building on previous demonstrations36,37, the setup is advanced by passive vibration damping and active interferometric position measurement of the lamellar optics at repetition rates up to 40 kHz for online feedback control and offline FT data tagging. These refinements improve the precision of the relative lamellar mirror displacement by 1-2 orders of magnitude, thereby improving the contrast in the recorded interferograms. This precision and stability is crucial for FT spectroscopy in the XUV spectral range. The

source. (c) The Fourier transform of the sketched interferogram provides the spectrum of the XUV source.

XUV light is reflected from the autocorrelator mirrors at the grazing incidence angle of  = 8. The SDU provides collinear propagation of the two coherent pulse replicas with variable delay controlled by translating the movable lamellar mirror with nanometer and attosecond precision, respectively. Note that the optical path difference (OPD) is given by

s = 2 ∑ z ∑ sin ,

(1)

with z being the mirror displacement. For instance, a displacement of z = 1 nm corresponds to about s = 280 pm, which results in a time delay between the copies of XUV pulses of only t = 0.93 as.

Upon reflection from the lamellar mirror assembly, the XUV beam is focused onto a Ce:YAG scintillator by a torroidal mirror with a focal length of f = 5.3 m. The wavefronts of each partial beam are parallel in each diffraction order. Thus,
the temporal interference generated in the far-field depends only on the longitudinal displacement of the lamellar mirrors. The diffraction maxima are separated by r =  f/d, where  is the central wavelength, d is the lamellar period and f is the focal length36. The maximum intensity continuously slips between even and odd diffraction orders as we scan the relative phase (time) delay between the two beams. At delay  = 0 the maximum intensity is reached in 0th order, whereas for  =  the odd diffraction orders are enhanced with maximum contrast due to the collinear beam propagation in the common-path interferometer37. The fluorescence signal from the scintillator is recorded by a CMOS camera. In order to obtain the field
auto-correlation (AC) trace of the light source, we integrate the signal intensity in the region-of-interest (ROI) encompassing the 0th-order diffraction maximum. Note that the 0th-order maximum consist of all frequencies selected by a plane multilayer mirror, which was designed for a photon energy of 26.6 eV and installed behind the lamellar mirror assembly in front of the
vacuum chamber hosting the detectors. In data processing we account for laser intensity fluctuations by normalizing the AC
signal to the overall signal intensity recorded by the CMOS detector. Additionally, we apply a centroiding algorithm correcting
the position of the image center in the far-field. This allows for correction of small beam pointing fluctuations. The field autocorrelation AF() is defined by

Figure 2. Linear auto-correlation trace of the HHG source (blue line) measured with the Ce:YAG scintillator. A typical
scintillator camera image of the diffraction orders is shown in the inset (bottom right). The interferogram is derived by
integrating the ROI (red square) and plotting the signal as a function of time-delay between the pulses. The Gaussian envelope fitted to the data gives a width  = 8 fs (FWHM) corresponding to a transform-limited pulse length of XUV = 5.7 fs. The magnification shows the field oscillations of the dominant 11th harmonic with a time period of T11th = 148 as. In addition a slower beating pattern with a period of T = 860 as can be resolved.

where EXUV (t) represents the complex electric field of the XUV pulse and  is the delay between two laser pulses. Note that the first term refers to the pulse energy and the second is the field AC. Thus, Eq.( 2) is the foundation of Fourier-transform spectroscopy. Measuring the interferogram AF() is equivalent to measuring the filtered spectrum of the harmonic source. The recorded signal is periodically modulated as a function of time delays and its Fourier transform yields the spectrum. We emphasize that the temporal profile (chirp) of the XUV pulse cannot be determined form AF(). However, the spectral bandwidth provides the transform-limited pulse duration and vice versa.
In principle, the interferogram can additionally visualize the number of attosecond bursts emitted during the HHG process29. This is possible if the spectral bandwidth of the harmonic emission is at least twice the photon energy of the driving laser. Only then the attosecond bursts generated twice per laser cycle do not merge together and can be resolved in the interferogram.

The sampling energy width of the Fourier-transform spectrometer depends solely on the OPD between the two XUV pulse replicas

where L is the maximum optical path difference that can be set in the autocorrelator. In our instrument the corresponding maximum mirror displacement of z = 1 mm at a grazing incidence angle  = 8 results in L = 278 µm, which gives a maximum sampling energy width of E = 4.5 meV. We note that for the device depicted in Fig. 1 the resolution is limited intrinsically by the transient loss of the transverse overlap between the two beams reflected from the lamellar mirror assembly
for larger delays, i.e. the increasing mirror displacement resulting in parallel beam separation.

Due to the the linearity of the Fourier transformation, the absolute calibration of the instrument requires only one reference spectral line. However, if this anchor point is not available, precise calibration of the delay time axis, i.e. the optical path difference in both interferometer arms, is still possible. It mainly requires exact knowledge of the grazing incidence angle of the photon beam impinging on the lamellar mirror assembly. Under these experimental conditions, an error of  = 0.1 would result in a relative energy mismatch of about 1.2 %, which is on the order of 300 meV for 26 eV photon energy. Note that this relative error is uniform and constant over all photon energies. In contrast, grating spectrometers separate wavelengths according to their characteristic diffraction angles. Thus, its absolute calibration requires series of well-known emission lines distributed over a broad spectral range e.g. equally spaced harmonics from an HHG process. Although the calibration of FT seems to be straightforward, we note in passing that it requires a well-collimated beam to start with. In our experiment we use a single toroidal mirror as a collimator. It is known that a toroid produces coma aberration, which we resolve in the

The spectrum reveals a dominant contribution from H11 at 26.6 eV and two satellite peaks from H9 (21.8 eV) and H13 (31.4 eV). The amplitude of satellites is strongly suppressed by the reflectance of the multilayer mirror (red), which is designed for H11.
far-field image of the focal spot (Fig. 2). Obviously, any kind of aberration in the far-field reduces the interference contrast in the measurement and a complex optical system for its compensation could be applied. For instance, studies using three toroidal mirrors controlled by a genetic algorithm achieved coma-free micrometer size focal spots38. However, it is the strength of the current common-path interferometer that these aberrations do not play a role here. As we will see in the following as long as individual diffraction orders can be resolved in the far-field image the quality of the interferograms is extremely good.
Results
The field AC trace of the HHG source is shown in Fig. 2. It reveals periodic sine-like modulations convoluted with a Gaussian envelope. The interferogram is obtained by integrating the intensity of the 0th order interference maximum and plotting the corresponding signal as a function of the time delay between the two XUV pulses. A typical image recorded by the camera shows the 0th and 1st diffraction orders as displayed in the inset (on the bottom right). We fit the Gaussian envelope to the AC signal and obtain the autocorrelation width of  = 8 fs (FWHM). Thus, the transform-limited XUV pulse length derived from the measurement is XUV = / 2 = 5.67 fs. Note that this is in excellent agreement with simulations of the HHG phase matching window39 and the single-atom response40, resulting in an XUV pulse duration of < 6 fs33.
In order to demonstrate the stability of the experimental setup we recorded interferograms with a sampling step size of t = 4 as. The clear oscillation shown in the zoom on the top right in the Fig. 2 demonstrate the precise control of the relative phase of the harmonic pulses on the attosecond time scale. The field oscillation has a period T11th = 148 as. In addition, a superimposed beating pattern is visible in the interferogram with a longer period of T = 860 as. It results from the neighboring harmonic orders H9 and H13, which pass the multi-layer mirror (ML) to some extent. It is worthwhile to note that this period matches the temporal separation of the individual bursts of attosecond laser pulses emitted at each optical half cycle of the driving laser pulse. At 515 nm drive wavelength, this corresponds to the observed time period of 860 as.
The Fourier transform of the recorded interferogram is displayed in Fig. 3. As expected, the spectrum shows a dominant peak at 26.6 eV (H11) with adjacent two weak satellite peaks at 21.8 eV (H9) and 31.4 eV (H13), respectively. This is in good agreement with the reflectivity curve of the multilayer mirror, which was optimized for a photon energy of 26.6 eV selecting H11 and strongly suppressing the other frequencies from the harmonic comb.
To exploit the full capacity of the FT instrument we spectrally narrow the 11th harmonic by filling parts of the vacuum chambers with Ar to increase its partial pressure, i.e. atom density. The presence of the Fano-resonance in the photo-absorption continuum of Ar around 26.6 eV modifies the transmitted spectrum due to the spectrally narrow decrease of the absorption cross section41. We have selected this transition for our benchmark experiment, because the underlying spectral tailoring has

been carefully analyzed previously by means of high-resolution grating-based spectroscopy42.

In Fig. 4 the results obtained from the FT measurements are compared with the spectrum recorded with the grating-based
XUV spectrometer at two different conditions. The total absorption cross section of Ar is plotted as a gray dashed line. At a base pressure of (a) p = 1 ∑ 10-5 mbar, i.e. negligible absorption due to the residual gas, the H11 energy bandwidth is E = 430 meV
(FWHM). Its width is due to the short pulse duration (broad spectrum) of the 515 nm driving laser. Subsequently, we tailor the
H11 transmission through the setup by utilizing the window-like Fano resonance. Therefore, we increase the Ar gas flow up to a backing pressure of (b) pAr = 8 ∑ 10-2 mbar. Under this condition both spectrometer types resolve the asymmetric Fano profile with E = 50 meV (FWHM). The results are in very good agreement with the reported linewidth of  = 76 meV for the 3s3p64p1P1 Fano-resonance measured at a synchrotron43. Notably, the FT energy resolution is solely limited by the accessible
delay range generated by the SDU as defined in Eq.( 3). As described in section 2, the specifications of the FT instrument give an energy sampling width of E = 4.5 meV. This allows to achieve a resolution of about E  13 meV with three sampling points per spectral line at 26.6 eV, which corresponds to E/E = 2000. Thus, the FT instrument offers comparable
resolution than state-of-the-art high-resolution grating-based XUV spectrometers. The latter used in our experiment provides E = 20 meV35 and its performance is in addition limited by the slit size, which compromises the signal strength on the detector.

An important parameter in Fourier-transform spectroscopy is the signal-to-noise ratio in the measured AC signal. To estimate the uncertainty limit of spectral features we use the following empirical relation to estimate the line precision

where k is a constant of the order of unity, which depends on the line shape. The value of NW gives the number of statistically independent points in a fitted line width W (FWHM) and S/N is the signal-to-noise ratio44. For the unperturbed H11 emission with S/N = 40, NW = 7 and W = 430 meV the accuracy is about 4 meV. For the sharp Fano resonance the accuracy is about 0.7 meV. Obviously, this effect is significantly smaller than the current resolution limit set by the maximum beampath difference of one interferometer arm with respect to the other.
The key finding of the present work is that the XUV Fourier-transform spectroscopy with the presented setup provides a better spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio compared to a high-performance grating spectrometer, which allows to extrapolate its performance towards even shorter wavelength.

Summary
In this contribution we present benchmark experiments applying a compact common-path interferometer for Fourier-transform spectroscopy in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range. The key component of the device is a broad-bandwidth Michelson-type all-reflective split-and-delay unit. It allows to record field autocorrelation traces at "extremely" short wavelengths as a function of time delay between two coherent pulse replicas with single digit attosecond resolution while scanning maximum delays up to 1 ps. The full capacity of the technique is demonstrated by characterizing the 11th harmonic emission line of an ultrafast 515 nm driving laser. As we tailor the unperturbed 430 meV wide spectrum at 26.6 eV by the window-like 3s3p64p1P1 Fano-resonance in Ar atoms we can clearly resolve the asymmetric lineshape with a natural width of E = 50 meV (FWHM) by sampling the data with an energy sampling width of 4.5 meV. We benchmark the results by comparing the data with experiments using a state-of-the-art grating-based high-resolution XUV spectrometer with a resolution of 20 meV and reach very good agreement. The power of interferometry for attosecond science becomes obvious when looking at the HHG process in time domain. The recorded field autocorrelation trace of the XUV lightwave oscillation with a dominant time period of 148 as shows fingerprints of attosecond bursts emitted every half cycle of the optical drive pulse, i.e. every 860 as.
Outlook
A future challenge for applications requiring high resolution exceeding of E/E > 104 is to increase the effective surface of the lamellar mirror assembly. This would support expanding the beam profile reflected from its surface and increasing the OPD without loosing the spatial overlap and interference contrast, respectively. It calls for advanced engineering and materials design, because manufacturing lamellar mirrors with larger area without distortion of the substrate on a level of 10 nm or less is demanding. Spatial distortions introduce phase errors in the reflected wavefronts, which reduce the interference contrast. Obviously, this is of great relevance for applications in the soft X-ray spectral range where the limits are truly on the single-digit nm scale. Therefore, we have started to develop special manufacturing protocols and coating procedures of the micromachined silicon substrates for producing the next generation of lamellar mirror assemblies for soft x-ray applications. Recently, we have performed pioneering soft x-ray autocorrelation experiments, where we managed to control the relative phase of pulse replicas at 4.5 nm central wavelength on the corresponding few attosecond timescale45. We could show that soft x-ray interferometry is a powerful tool to probe ultrafast correlated quantum phenomena such as the excitation of Auger shake-up states with sub-cycle precision. Even without recording a complete autocorrelation trace and just measuring a few optical cycles we discovered that specific non-radiative Auger decay channels show a relative time (phase) delay of only 3 as with respect to the driving lightwave oscillation. This is among the fastest electronic processes ever measured demonstrating the power of phase-sensitive detection of interaction products using coherent soft x-ray pulse pairs.
Thus we can conclude that the performance of our interferometric autocorrelator at the heart of the FT spectrometer opens up a new window of opportunities for soft X-ray pulse metrology, high-resolution spectroscopy and dynamic studies in matter, materials and in the life sciences. Of particular interest is the so-called water window, which refers to the spectral range between the K-absorption edge of oxygen at a wavelength of 2.34 nm and the K-absorption edge of carbon at 4.4 nm corresponding to photon energies of 530 and 280 eV, respectively. Water is transparent to these soft x-rays, while carbon, nitrogen and other elements found in biomolecules are absorbing, which may allow to unravel biological functions with element-specificity in natural environment.
