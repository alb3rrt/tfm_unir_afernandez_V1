ABSTRACT
Detailed measurements of the in-plane resistivity were performed in a high-quality Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 (x = 0.065) single crystal, in magnetic fields up to 9 T and with different orientations  relative to the crystal c axis. A significant (T )H, rounding is observed just above the superconducting critical temperature Tc due to Cooper pairs created by superconducting fluctuations. These data are analyzed in terms of a generalization of the Aslamazov-Larkin approach, that extends its applicability to high reduced-temperatures and magnetic fields. This method allows us to carry out a criterion-independent determination of the angular dependence of the upper critical field, Hc2( ). In spite of the relatively small anisotropy of this compound, it is found that Hc2( ) presents a significant deviation from the single-band 3D anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (3D-aGL) approach, particularly for large  (typically above  60o). These results are interpreted in terms of the multiband nature of these materials, in contrast with other proposals for similar Hc2( ) anomalies. Our results are also consistent with an effective anisotropy factor almost temperature independent near Tc, a result that differs from the ones obtained by using a single-band model.

Introduction
Since the discovery of superconductivity at relatively high temperatures in Fe-based superconductors (FeSC)1 in 2008, intensive research on these materials has been taking place. On the one hand, these materials present high critical magnetic fields and low anisotropies, for which they have received great attention towards their potential applications in electric transport under high magnetic fields.2,3 On the other hand, there is a fundamental interest in discovering the pairing mechanism responsible for their high critical temperature, which could be related to the one of cuprates. They also present unconventional superconducting properties associated to their multiband electronic structure, with energy gaps that depend on the doping level and on the pressure (external or chemical).4­8 An example of this would be the anomalous temperature dependences of the magnetic penetration depth,9 the specific heat,10,11 or the upper critical field,12­14 that have been interpreted in terms of theoretical models with two effective superconducting gaps.15,16
The angular dependence of the upper critical magnetic field, Hc2( ), where  is the angle between the applied magnetic field and the crystal c axis, has been less studied. If the bands contributing to the superconductivity have different anisotropies, then Hc2( ) may differ from the single-band 3D-anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (3D-aGL) approach, that may be written as17

The reason for the discrepancies lies in the experimental difficulties to determine the upper critical field. The Hc2(T ) line is generally obtained from the T and H pairs at which the electrical resistivity falls to a given percentage of the normal-state resistivity.18­23 Nonetheless, this procedure is strongly dependent on the particular criterion used (e.g., 20%, 50% or 80%

of n), as different factors round the (T ) curves near the superconducting transition temperature, Tc(H). Firstly, due to the relatively high Tc and the small value of the coherence length (just a few nm), thermal fluctuation effects near Tc(H) play an important role in these materials,26 and contribute to the rounding of the resistive transition.27­31 These effects are

also strongly dependent on the amplitude and orientation of the applied magnetic field.32 A second factor is the effect of

Tc inhomogeneities: These compounds are generally non-stoichiometric, and their Tc depends on the doping level. Given the small values of the coherence length, it is expected that even a random distribution of dopants would lead to nanoscale

Tc variations,33 which results in a smoothing of the resistive transition, an effect particularly important in non-optimallydoped compounds.27 Finally, the resistive transition is extended by vortex dynamics below Tc(H), down to the irreversibility temperature, under which the vortices are pinned.

In this work, we present measurements of the in-plane resistivity versus temperature under magnetic fields with different

amplitudes and orientations with respect to the crystal c axis, in an optimally-doped Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 (OP-BaFeCoAs) single crystal. This compound is one of the most studied FeSC, and nowadays it is possible to grow large single crystals

of both the highest stoichiometric and structural quality. In contrast with the aforementioned procedures to obtain the upper

critical field, the (T )H, rounding will be studied in terms effect of superconducting fluctuations, which is applicable

of in

a generalization of the region of high

the Aslamazov-Larkin (AL) approach for the reduced temperatures and magnetic fields.27

The analysis will allow us to obtain a criterion-independent determination of the angular dependence of the upper critical field,

Hc2( ). The result will be analyzed in terms of existing models for multiband superconductors.15,16

Results

Figure 1 shows the resulting (T )H, near the superconducting transition temperature in detail. The zero-field transition temperature Tc = 22.7 K was estimated from the maximum of the d/dT curve (solid line in Fig. 1a). The Tc uncertainty is ±0.5 K, which is primarily caused by the resistivity rounding associated with superconducting fluctuations.27 As it can be

seen, Tc shifts to lower temperatures as the magnetic field is increased. This effect is more pronounced for H  ab (i.e.,  = 0)

than data

for H may be

ab ( = 90), due to the anisotropy of the corresponding upper critical fields, then used to estimate Hc2(T,  ). However, in the available range of magnetic

respectively. shift is close

These to the

Tc uncertainty, mainly attributed to the aforementioned resistivity rounding. For this reason, the results are highly dependent

on the criterion used to determine Tc(H,  ) (typically the temperature at which the resistivity falls to a given fraction of the

extrapolated normal-state resistivity). In the next section, a criterion-independent determination of the angular dependence of

Hc2 will be presented through the analysis of the superconducting fluctuations, obtained from the rounding above Tc(H,  ).

Determination of the normal state background The conductivity induced by superconducting fluctuations (or paraconductivity) is given by

 (T )H, = (T )H, - B(T )H,

(2)

where B(T )H, is the normal-state or background resistivity extrapolated to temperatures near Tc. This background resistivity was determined by a linear fit to the resistivity above 35 K (i.e., above 1.5Tc) where fluctuation effects are expected to be negligible.27­31 Some examples of this procedure for different field amplitudes and orientations are presented in Figs. 2a-c.

Analysis of  for  = 0 data A first comparison with the experimental data was performed for the  data for  = 0 presented in Fig. 2d. As it can be seen, the rounding associated with fluctuation effects can be clearly observed a few degrees above Tc. The data were analyzed in terms of the 3D-anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (GL) approach developed in Ref. 27, which is valid under finite magnetic field
amplitudes. For H  ab, it may be written as

where   ln(T /Tc) is the reduced temperature, h  H/Hc2 the reduced magnetic field, Hc2 the linear extrapolation to T = 0 K of the upper critical field for H  ab, e the electron charge, c(0) the c axis coherence length amplitude, and c a cutoff constant of the order of magnitude of the unity, introduced to exclude the contribution of high-energy fluctuation modes.34 It is clear

2/14

to see that c corresponds to the reduced temperature at which fluctuation effects vanish. As it can be seen in Figs. 2a-c, the measured (T ) deviates from B(T ) (beyond the experimental uncertainty) when T < 30 - 31 K, which corresponds to a reduced temperature around 0.3. Thus, in what follows we have set c = 0.3, a value that is close to the one found in other FeSC.27­31 In the zero-field limit (for h  ), and in the absence of cutoff (c  ), equation (3) reduces to the well known Aslamazov-Larkin expression,  () = e2/32h¯c(0)1/2.
The lines in Fig. 2d are the best fit of equation (3) to the set of data obtained with fields between 2 and 9 T, with only two free parameters: c(0), which is directly related to the  amplitude, and Hc2, which is implicit in the equation through the reduced magnetic field h, and which is related to the temperature shift of  induced by the magnetic field. As it can be seen, the agreement is excellent, leading to c(0) = 6.89 ± 0.15 Å and Hc2 = 42.5 ± 0.5 T. Experimental data up to 1 T were excluded from the fitting as a significant disagreement with the GL approach was found in previous works, while studying the fluctuation effects in other FeSC families. It has been hypothesized that this discrepancy may arise from a Tc distribution27,28 or from phase fluctuations,35­37 which could be relevant near Tc and under low fields in these materials.

Analysis of  for arbitrary  and angular dependence of Hc2 We will now analyze the experimental data obtained with different H orientations. To this purpose, the reduced magnetic field in equation (3) must be replaced by32

where Hc2( ) is the upper critical field (linearly extrapolated to T = 0 K) for an arbitrary field orientation relative to the c axis. The  (T ) data in Fig. 3a were obtained under a 9 T magnetic field applied with different orientations ( runs from 0 to 90 in steps of 3). The lines are fits of equation (3) to each  dataset with the above c(0) and c as fixed parameters, and Hc2( ) as the only free parameter. As it can be seen, the fits are in excellent agreement with our data. The resulting angular dependence of the upper critical field is presented in Figs. 3b, c, d. From this figure, it follows that the upper critical fields
extrapolated to T = 0 K are 43 T for H  ab and 120 T for H ab. The corresponding slopes at Tc, -1.9 T/K for H  ab and -5.3 T/K for H ab, are close to the ones found in the literature.38­43 The orange line in this figure is the prediction of

the single-band 3D anisotropic GL approach, equation (1), evaluated with the experimental Hc2 and Hc2. A good agreement is found at low  , but for large  the behavior is qualitatively closer to the one found in 2D superconductors, approaching

90 with a finite slope. This can be clearly seen in the linearized representation shown in Fig. 3c. For comparison, Tinkham's

A recent review on the relevance of multiband effects in Fe-based and other superconductors may also be seen in Ref. 56. How-

ever, it is worth noting that, in some cases, multiple superconducting bands and anisotropy affect some observables similarly

3/14

(see e.g., Ref. 57 on the anomalous T -dependence of the superfluid density of OsBe2). Nonetheless, our previous analysis clearly shows that the Hc2( ) dependency cannot be explained with a reasonable anisotropy factor.
The angular dependence of the upper critical field in two-band superconductors was calculated by Gurevich in both the dirty15 and clean limits.13,16 A criterion for a superconductor to be in the dirty limit may be expressed as h¯ /(0)  , where (0) is one-half the superconducting energy gap at T = 0 K, and  the quasiparticles relaxation time. In OPBaFeCoAs the small and large gaps are, respectively,  3kBTc and  6kBTc (see e.g., Refs. 11, 47­49, 52­54), which leads to h¯ /(0)  (7 - 3.5) × 10-14 s. In turn, near Tc it is found that   (1 - 2) × 10-14 s.58,59 Thus, OP-BaFeCoAs may be closer to the dirty limit, for which Hc2( ) may be expressed as15

The line in Fig. 3d is the best fit of equation (10) to the Hc2( ) data resulting from the analysis of  . As it can be seen, the agreement is excellent in the entire  range, and leads to  = 0.61 ± 0.21, 1 = 8.7 ± 2.2, 2 = 1.28 ± 0.16. As OP-BaFeCoAs is not strictly in the dirty limit these values may be just approximated, but the result suggests that both bands contribute similarly, and that the observed anisotropy comes essentially from one of the bands.

Comparison with the usual procedure to obtain the upper critical field Figures 4a-c shows Hc2(T ) , as obtained from the magnetic field and temperature pairs at which the resistivity (T )H, falls to a given percentage of the background resistivity, which is the most often used procedure in the literature to determine the upper critical field. As it can be seen, the obtained Hc2(T ) is linear with T , except very close to Tc (within the resistive transition width). The linear extrapolation of Hc2 to T = 0 K is presented in Fig. 4d as a function of  . As expected in view of the important fluctuation effects around Tc, the Hc2 amplitude is highly dependent on the chosen criterion. Furthermore, the Hc2( ) profile is different from the one resulting from the  analysis (solid data points), with a less pronounced maximum near  = 90. However, as shown in Fig. 4e, the calculated Hc2( ) resulting from a criterion neither follows the behavior predicted by the 3D anisotropic GL approach, which is consistent with previous works.22,23

3D-anisotropic GL scaling of the resistivity around Tc Previous works in different FeSC families showed that the (T )H, data scale when represented against H(cos2  +sin2  /2)1/2, according to the 3D-aGL approach.60­64 This scaling was used to determine the anisotropy factor, that in most cases was found to be temperature-dependent.60­63 As it can be seen in Fig. 5b such scaling also works with our data (examples of unscaled data for 20-22 K are presented in Fig. 5a). The resulting anisotropy factor (inset in Fig. 5b) presents a significant temperature
dependence, increasing linearly from 2.75 at 19 K to 3.75 near Tc. Nonetheless, this -dependence must be affected to some extent by the anomalous Hc2( ) observed above. To test this hypothesis, we repeated the scaling only using data with  < 60, for which the Hc2( ) is still close to the single-band 3D-aGL prediction, as can be seen in Fig. 5c. With this criterion, a good scaling is achieved with a temperature-independent anisotropy factor  = 3 (a similar agreement is obtained with a  value between 2.7 and 3.3). A T -independent  was also found in Ref. 64 in Ba1-xNaxFe2As2 (x = 0.35 - 0.4), after excluding  data close to 90. The failure of the scaling at high  in the aforementioned paper was attributed to a transition to a 2D
behavior. Nevertheless, in the present case such a possibility is ruled out by the excellent agreement of the 3D approach for  with the experimental data up to  = 90.

Analysis of the irreversibility field For completeness, we present the temperature dependence of the irreversibility field, Hirr, for different  values as shown in Fig. 6a. Hirr was determined by using a 1% criterion on B(Tc). The solid lines were obtained as the best fit to the power law Hirr = A( )(Tc - T )n to all Hirr(T ) curves by leaving A as a free parameter for each  and the same n for all curves. The fit quality is excellent, and leads to n = 1.30 ± 0.14, close to the value found in other iron-based superconductors,65,66 and in high-Tc cuprates.67,68
The 5 T and 9 T series, for which Hirr was obtained in  -steps of 3, were analyzed to obtain the angular dependence of the irreversibility field, as shown in Fig. 6b. The solid lines in this figure are fits to the previously mentioned power law with n = 1.30 and A as the only free parameter for each  -series. From these curves Hirr( ) was obtained for different temperatures (see Fig. 6c). Contrary to the results obtained for the upper critical field, we found that the irreversibility field follows the 3D-aGL angular dependence closely (equation (1), solid lines). This result is confirmed by the excellent 3D-aGL

Conclusions
The electrical resistivity was measured in a high-quality OP-BaFeCoAs crystal, under magnetic fields with different amplitudes and orientations relative to the crystal c axis. The rounding observed just above Tc(H) was interpreted in terms of Cooper pairs created by thermal fluctuations. The comparison with a generalization to finite fields of the AL approach for fluctuation effects, allowed a criterion-independent determination of Hc2( ) to be made. The result differs significantly with the prediction of the single-band 3D-anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau approach, particularly for magnetic fields close to the crystal ab layers. The behavior is similar to the one of quasi-2D superconductors, but this possibility is inconsistent with the 3D nature of the superconducting fluctuations above Tc(H). Hc2( ) was then successfully compared with a theoretical approach for dirty two-band superconductors. Although OP-BaFeCoAs is not strictly in the dirty limit, the result suggests that both bands contribute with roughly the same weight, and that the observed anisotropy comes essentially from a highly anisotropic band (1 = 8.7 ± 2.2), while the other band is almost isotropic (2 = 1.28 ± 0.16). This result contrasts with alternative explanations for a similar anomalous Hc2( ) behavior observed in these materials.20­23
We have also found that the resistivity scales with H(cos2  + sin2  /2)1/2, as predicted by the 3D-aGL approach, if the data are restricted to  < 60, where Hc2( ) is reasonably well described by the 3D-aGL expression (equation (1)). This leads to a temperature-independent effective , in striking contrast with previous works reporting a strongly temperature-dependent  near Tc.60­63 Finally, in contrast with the upper critical field, the irreversibility field (determined from a 1% criterion on the normal-state resistivity) presents an angular dependence fully consistent with the one expected for 3D anisotropic superconductors, suggesting that the multiband electronic structure does not noticeably affect the vortex pinning. Nevertheless, it is possible that the symmetry of the vortex lattice in these materials could be affected by the presence of several bands, as recently observed in MgB2.69
It would be interesting to extend the present study to other FeSC families (e.g., 112,70 10-3-8 and 10-4-8,71­73 for which a possible quasi-2D behavior29 may also affect the Hc2( ) angular dependence), and to probe signatures of crossband pairing, that could be present in these materials, as it has been recently proposed.74

Methods
The Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 (x = 0.065) crystal was grown following the procedure described in previous works.75,76 It is a 2.902 mg plate with a 3.1 mm2 surface parallel to the crystal ab layers, and a thickness of 144 µm along the crystal c axis (as determined from the density calculated from the lattice parameters).
The homogeneity of the crystal structure was tested by x-ray diffraction. As it can be seen in Fig. 7, the  - 2 pattern (performed with a Rigaku Miniflex II diffractometer with a Cu target and a graphite monochromator) presents only (00l) reflections, indicating the excellent structural quality of the crystal. The resulting c axis lattice parameter (that is the same as the FeAs layers interdistance, s) is 12.979(2) Å, in agreement with data in the literature for crystals with a similar composition.43,76 The inset in Fig. 7 represents the  - 2 intensity map for the (004) peak, performed with a Panalytical-Empyrean diffractometer. As it can be seen, the dispersion in  is  0.2, which indicates the excellent alignment of the crystal c axis.
The ab layers dc resistivity  was measured in the presence of magnetic fields up to 9 T with different orientations  relative to the crystal c axis. To obtain these measurements, a Quantum Design's Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) equipped with a rotating sample holder with an angular resolution of about 0.01, was used. The electrical contacts (inline configuration) were made with four gold wires (50 µm diameter) attached to the crystal with silver paste. The excitation current was 1 mA. To avoid the mechanical backlash, the target angles were always approached from an angle smaller by a

5/14

few degrees. Prior to the measurements, the precise  = 90 position was identified by a ( ) calibration measurement at 20 K under a 9 T magnetic field (see the inset in Fig. 1). The actual  = 90 position was found to be  2 away from the nominal value, probably due to the General Electric varnish used to attach the sample to the holder.

The normal-state backgrounds (red lines) were determined by linear fits above 35 K ( 1.5Tc), where fluctuation effects are negligible. d Temperature dependence of the fluctuation conductivity under different magnetic
fields, applied perpendicular to the crystal ab layers ( = 0). The lines are the best fit of equation (3) to the data between 2 and 9 T. The arrows indicate Tc(H) = Tc(1 - H/Hc2(0)) for the magnetic fields used in the experiments.

Figure 3. a Temperature dependence of the fluctuation conductivity obtained with a 9 T magnetic field, for different orientations relative to the crystal c axis ( -steps of 3 between 0 and 90). The lines are the best fits of equation (3), with the c(0) value resulting from the analysis in Fig. 2d, and Hc2( ) as the only free parameter. The resulting Hc2( ) are the data points in b, c and d (the error bars are only shown in d for clarity). b Hc2( ) data compared to the single-band 3D-anisotropic GL approach, (orange line, equation (1)), the 2D Tinkham's result (green line, equation (5)) and quasi-2D Mineev's result (black line, equation (6)). c Same plot as b, in a linearized scale. d Hc2( ) compared with Gurevich's approach for dirty 2-band superconductors (equation (7)).

Figure 4. a-c Hc2(T ) calculated as the magnetic field and temperature pairs at which the resistivity falls to a given percentage of the background resistivity at Tc. The behavior is linear up to very close to Tc (within the resistive transition width), where a Tc distribution may strongly affect the (T )H, behavior. The extrapolation to 0 K is presented in d, where it is shown that no criteria match the result from the  analysis (black circles), which shows a more pronounced maximum close to 90. In e, it is shown that the Hc2 resulting from a criteria neither follows the 3D-aGL angular dependence.
