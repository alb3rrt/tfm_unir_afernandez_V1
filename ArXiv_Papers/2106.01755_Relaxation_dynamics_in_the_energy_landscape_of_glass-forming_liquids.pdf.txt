We numerically study the relaxation dynamics of several glass-forming models to their inherent structures, following quenches from equilibrium configurations sampled across a wide range of temperatures. In a mean-field Mari-Kurchan model, we find that relaxation changes from a power-law to an exponential decay below a well-defined temperature, consistent with recent findings in mean-field p-spin models. By contrast, for finite-dimensional systems, the relaxation is always algebraic, with a non-trivial universal exponent at high temperatures crossing over to a harmonic value at low temperatures. We demonstrate that this apparent evolution is controlled by a temperature-dependent population of localised excitations. Our work unifies several recent lines of studies aiming at a detailed characterization of the complex potential energy landscape of glass-formers.

I. INTRODUCTION
Many systems of scientific interest are described as `complex', even though definitions of complexity may vary across scientific fields [1]. For many-body interacting systems, the potential energy landscape, E({r}), which describes the potential energy E of the system as a function of the complete set of coordinates {r} of its constituents, has become a central object of study [2, 3]. It serves both empirical goals, for instance to picture the dynamic evolution of a system in a `rugged' landscape [4], but can also be described mathematically very precisely [2, 5, 6]. The detailed characterisation and dynamic exploration of complex potential energy landscapes are important problems for disordered materials [4, 7, 8], optimisation problems [9], and machine learning algorithms [10, 11].
Since the work of Goldstein [12], the physics of glassy systems is often described in terms of the properties of their potential energy landscapes. The large number of energy minima connected by complex dynamic pathways is typically invoked in introductory lectures about amorphous media [4]. Analytically, the properties of the potential energy landscape of glass-forming models have been studied extensively at the mean-field level through the analysis of fully-connected disordered spin models, such as p-spin models. In this limit, the phase space can be divided into long-lived metastable states (or, pure states), and both free-energy and energy landscapes can be studied in great detail, thus providing a firm relation between the landscape structure and the thermodynamics and dynamics of the system [5, 6, 13]. Current efforts in this area concern the analysis of dynamic pathways [14], or corrections to mean-field [15].
In finite dimensions, the study of energy minima, or inherent structures, first gained momentum when Stillinger

and Weber transformed Goldstein's ideas into concrete tools to both explore and exploit the potential energy landscape of glasses [4, 16]. A key step is the tiling of the equilibrium configuration space, pertinent to describe physical properties, into basins of attraction surrounding energy minima. It is this mapping which putatively connects the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of glass-formers to the topography of their potential energy landscape, although the relevance of such an approach has often been debated [17, 18], because pure states do not exist in finite dimensions [19]. The analysis of energy minima has been used to estimate the configurational entropy [7], while saddle points were discussed in connection with the dynamic mode-coupling crossover [20­23]. However, these approaches do not have the same level of rigor as those in p-spin models since inherent structures are different from pure states [19, 24, 25]. The structure of the potential energy landscape and its precise relationship with dynamics and thermodynamics remain under intense scrutiny [8, 26]. In particular, the role of excitations in the potential energy landscape has been discussed in connection with sound propagation [27], specific heat [28], vibrational [29] and mechanical properties [30].
Virtually all studies of glassy landscapes start by `instantaneously' relaxing configurations to the `nearest' energy minimum, following known numerical recipes [31]. Strangely, however, only few studies have been dedicated to the physical processes at play during the energy minimization itself [32­36]. This is unfortunate because this relaxation dynamics provides in fact a convenient way to navigate the potential energy landscape and explore its geometry. Suppose for instance that the landscape is simple and smooth. Using steepest descent dynamics, the system should then settle in an inherent structure very quickly while, on a rugged landscape, the system meanders and crosses many saddles during relaxation [37].

2

Thus the steepest descent dynamics probes the detailed structure of the potential energy landscape, and potentially illuminates its connection to the physical dynamics.
Recently, the analysis of steepest descent in mixed mean-field p-spin glass models revealed the existence of two important characteristic temperatures [33]. First, starting from initial states prepared at high temperatures T , the energy density of the final inherent state is constant for T > Tonset, and it decreases with decreasing T when T  Tonset. This sharp onset temperature does not affect the relaxation dynamics itself which obeys a nontrivial power-law time dependence as long as T  TSF. By contrast, the decay is exponentially fast below TSF (initials stand for `State Following'). This implies that the system is always close to an energy minimum for T  TSF in which it converges very quickly by steepest descent. The critical temperature TSF < Tonset also reflects a change in the structure of the potential energy landscape, as inherent states have a marginal density of states above TSF, which becomes gapped below. Within p-spin models, these two characteristic temperatures are unrelated to the equilibrium dynamics, which becomes non-ergodic at the mode-coupling temperature TMCT, distinct from both TSF and Tonset, showing that even at mean-field level free-energy and energy landscapes are different objects.
In numerical studies, the relaxation dynamics in D = 2 and 3 (D is the space dimension) harmonic spheres just above jamming was recently studied starting from high temperatures including random configurations at T =  [32], and a power-law time decay was found with a non-trivial, dimension-dependent exponent. Another recent work [34] explores the statistics of single particle displacements between initial and final configurations in several models and reports the existence of a crossover temperature separating high- from low-temperature behaviours. These interesting studies do not yet provide a complete physical picture of the relaxation dynamics towards energy minima, neither do they assess the existence of the critical temperature TSF found in mean-field approaches. The universality of the power-law time dependence found near jamming across models, and even the effect of spatial dimension and initial temperatures were not fully elucidated, either.
Here, we numerically study the steepest descent dynamics in glass-forming liquids. We address its dimensionality, universality, and initial stability dependences by studying a mean-field Mari-Kurchan model and three finite-dimensional models in two, three, four, and eight dimensions using a wide range of initial states obtained through the swap Monte-Carlo algorithm. We numerically detect the predicted mean-field transition at TSF in the Mari-Kurchan model. However, the transition is absent in all finite dimensional models, where it is replaced by a smooth temperature evolution between two limits that we analyse in detail. We show that this crossover is controlled by a finite population of localised defects where particle rearrangements take place during

the minimisation, with a concentration that decreases at low temperatures. Therefore, finite dimensional glassforming systems at finite temperatures can not be seen as inherent structures excited by small thermal fluctuations. Our results provide a complete picture of the relaxation dynamics in glassy landscapes, and illuminate the role of localised defects in finite-dimensional structural glasses.

We consider several structural glass models in various

of preparation temperatures. We study a soft sphere ver-

sion of the mean-field Mari-Kurchan model [38], polydis-

perse soft sphere models in two [39] and three dimen-

sions [40], harmonic spheres [41] in two, three, four, and

eight dimensions, and the Kob-Andersen model [42] for

two and three dimensions. Note that soft sphere models

have a steep repulsive interaction with an r-12 core and

a short cutoff, whereas the harmonic potential models

have a very soft core, which may affect the T   limit

for initial conditions. The Kob-Andersen model uses the

Lennard-Jones potential with a steep repulsive core and

attractive forces at larger distances.

To prepare equilibrium configurations in a wide range

of temperatures, we use the planting method [43] for

the Mari-Kurchan model and the swap Monte-Carlo algorithm [40] for some of the finite-dimensional systems, which should allow us to detect any of the putative transitions predicted from mean-field landscapes. Further details about the models and simulation protocols are provided in Methods and Supplementary Information (SI).

B. Mean-field Mari-Kurchan model
Thanks to its mean-field nature, we can apply the replica liquid theory to the Mari-Kurchan model, as detailed in SI, and obtain the dynamical mode-coupling transition temperature: TMCT 0.0084. We also studied the equilibrium dynamics using a simple Metropolis algorithm, and find that the theoretical estimate of TMCT describes the numerical data reasonably well. This study allows us to also estimate the onset temperature for slow dynamics: Tonset 0.015.
We study the steepest descent starting from equilibrium configurations in the range T  [0.0001, 0.015]. Figure 1 shows the velocity decay |v(t)| for various temperatures and system sizes. Figure 1(a) shows that the relaxation dynamics strongly depends on temperature. For high temperatures, T 0.006, |v(t)| follows a clear power-law decay with an exponent that we estimate as

 0.75. In a finite size system, this power law decay is interrupted at long times. On the other hand, at low temperatures, an exponential decay occurs. These results suggest that the high and low temperature relaxation dynamics are qualitatively different, and are separated by a critical temperature.
To fully confirm the distinct occurrence of power-law and exponential decays, we analyse finite-size effects. In Fig. 1(b), we show the velocity |v(t)| for several system sizes at two selected temperatures. At high temperature T = 0.015, |v| has a strong system-size dependence. Larger systems take longer times to reach energy minima and follow the power-law decay with  0.75 over a broader time window. The system-size dependence suggests that in the thermodynamic limit, N  , the velocity decay has a genuine power-law behavior with a diverging time scale. At very low temperature, T = 0.0001 instead, the velocity decay has almost no system-size dependence, implying that the time to reach energy minima remains finite in the thermodynamic limit, confirming the exponential decay.
Therefore, in the temperature regime between 0.0001 and 0.006, the Mari-Kurchan model displays a transition characterizing the nature of the relaxation dynamics akin to the behaviour reported at the temperature TSF discussed in p-spin models. Interestingly, for the MK model, the TSF is noticeably smaller than the estimated TMCT  0.0084, confirming that these two temperatures should be distinguished (they are equal in some versions of p-spin models).
While the existence of the transition is compatible with results for the mixed p-spin glass model, the decay exponent  0.75 at high temperatures observed for the Mari-Kurchan model differs slightly from the spin glass model where  0.83 [44]. A broader class of meanfield models and even more extensive numerics should be explored to settle the relevance of this small difference.
C. Finite-dimensional models
For finite D systems, we first consider the relaxation dynamics starting from the high-temperature limit, T  , in various models and spatial dimensions. Figure 2(a) shows the results for monodisperse harmonic spheres in dimensions D = 2, 3, 4, and 8. In all dimensions, we observe a power-law decay, but the exponent  depends on D. We find  0.92 for D = 2 and  0.85 for D = 3, which are consistent with previous work [32]. For D = 4 and 8, on the other hand, the results are described by the same exponent  0.75. This suggests that a meanfield value  = 0.75 in the high temperature regime is reached for D  4. Interestingly, this exponent is close to the one observed in the Mari-Kurchan model at high temperatures. In SI, we discuss the system-size dependence of |v(t)| . Larger systems always take a longer time to reach energy minima, consistently with a pure power law decay in the thermodynamic limit N   at

large times.
To investigate universality, we look at the results at high temperatures for various models. Figures 2(b-f) show the velocity decay for harmonic and soft spheres, and the Kob-Andersen model. Note that for soft spheres and Kob-Andersen models, the influence of the repulsive core can be felt at arbitrarily large temperatures. Nevertheless, all models at higher temperatures asymptotically show  0.92 and 0.85 in D = 2 and D = 3, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that the value of  is universal, irrespective of the details of the interaction potentials, size polydispersity, or the proximity of a jamming transition.
We then study the effect of the initial stability on the relaxation dynamics. We first consider D = 3 polydisperse soft spheres. Using the swap Monte Carlo algorithm, we vary initial equilibrium temperature quite significantly, T  [0.062, 1.0], which includes TMCT 0.1 and Tonset 0.18 determined by standard methods [40]. The model reproduces the universal exponent in D = 3,  = 0.85, at finite but high temperatures, see Fig. 2(b). With decreasing temperature, the velocity relaxation |v(t)| becomes faster, as expected from the physical intuition that the system starts closer to an energy minimum in a smoother landscape. However, even at temperatures much below TMCT, the velocity relaxation |v(t)| displays a power-law decay, but with a larger apparent exponent,  1.25. The same exponent at low T is found in the D = 3 Kob-Andersen model [see Fig. 2(c)], suggesting that  1.25 is also universal. We vary the initial stability for D = 2 harmonic spheres, soft spheres,

and the Kob-Andersen model in Fig. 2(d), (e), and (f). The data demonstrate the same trend as in D = 3 models, yet the low-temperature velocity decay exponent is now  1 in all three models, different from the D = 3 value. Importantly, we do not observe an exponential decay at any studied temperatures in any of the finitedimensional models, in contrast to the mean-field spin glass and Mari-Kurchan models. Instead, we find that the high- and low-temperature regimes are both characterised by universal power-laws, with an exponent which only depends on the spatial dimension.

D. Harmonic limit

We can rationalize our numerical observations at low temperatures using a harmonic dynamical description. At very low temperatures, the initial equilibrium configuration is located nearer to the final inherent state. Thus, it makes sense to approximate the energy during the steepest descent dynamics using an expansion

We then find that the velocity should decay with an exponent harm = D/4 + 1/2, yielding harm = 1 and 1.25 for D = 2 and D = 3, respectively. (See SI for a more detailed discussion of the harmonic approximation, which also shows that quasi-localised modes provide a subdominant contribution to the velocity decay for D < 5.) These values are fully consistent with our numerical observations, which means that the low-temperature relaxation dynamics appears to be well-described, at least over the simulated timescales and system sizes, by a simple harmonic approach.
E. Localised defects
The harmonic analysis shows that, because of phonons, the mean-field transition at TSF to gapped energy minima reached exponentially fast cannot exist in finite D, and relaxation dynamics is in fact necessarily algebraic, even in a harmonic, `state following' limit. Our numerics is nevertheless compatible with two distinct temperature regimes, with non-harmonic effects becoming predominant at high T . Is a sharp transition separating these two regimes?
To address this question, we must understand the microscopic relaxation mechanism beyond the harmonic limit. At very low temperatures, we expect that the initial configuration and the final inherent state differ by small displacements which do not affect much the geometry of the particle packing. Figure 3(a-c) show the displacement and non-affine displacement fields [46] between initial and final configurations for the D = 2 soft sphere system. For T = 0.035, where the harmonic description works well (and  = harm = 1.0 is measured), particle

displacements are indeed very small, implying that most

particles interact with the same neighbours in initial and

final states, see Fig. 3(a). For T = 0.2, however, larger

displacements are observed, and the most mobile parti-

cles are spatially correlated, see Fig. 3(b). Large non-

affine displacements are associated with localised par-

ticle rearrangements occurring during the steepest de-

scent, which we call `defects'. As the temperature is in-

creased further, more particles have large non-affine dis-

placements, see Fig. 3(c), and the initial and final con-

figurations become substantially different.

To quantify particle rearrangements during minimisa-

tion, we introduce a variable i for each particle defined

such that i = 0 if particle i neither loses nor gains any

neighbour during steepest descent, and i = 1 otherwise

(see

SI

for

precise

definitions),

the concentration of such defects in a given configuration

with N particles. The field i thus identifies the loca-
tion of particle rearrangements, as shown in Fig. 3(d-f). Red particles with i = 1 are found in high Dm2 in regions, which validates the proposed identification of de-

fects. The defects are also observed in the displacement

field |ri(t) - ri()|, see SI for further discussion. In Ref. [32], similar defects were visualised using the non-

affine velocity field.

In Fig. 4, we show the average concentration of defects,

The average defect density is a smooth function of temperature which seems to remain finite at any T > 0. The susceptibility shows a well-defined peak, whose shape and location are independent of the system size, see Fig. 4(b). These results indicate that no sharp phase transition (with a vanishing  ) separates the relaxation dynamics between high and low temperatures. The defect density has a sigmoidal shape as it saturates to unity at large T and decreases very rapidly to small values as T  0. It displays an inflection point at a temperature Tdef that also corresponds to the peak of the susceptibility. Physically, Tdef represents the temperature where  varies more strongly with T and has the largest fluctuations, thus separating the high-T regime where  approaches unity, from low-T where it is very small. The gradual disappearance of localised rearrangements is coherent with the temperature evolution of the self vanHove function [34]. The discussion of the harmonic limit in Sec. II D showed that the defects revealed by steepest descent dynamics at lower temperatures do not simply result from the harmonic excitation of the quasi-localised modes populating the low-frequency part of the density of states (which would lead to a different power law decay), although a more complicated relation could exist.
III. DISCUSSION
We studied the physical dynamics during steepest descent energy minimisation for various glass-forming models in spatial dimensions D = 2 to D = 8 and also in the mean-field limit, for a wide range of initial conditions. Focusing on the exponent  characterizing the algebraic decay of the average velocity, we identified its universal, finite dimensional features. First, we showed that the mean-field transition at temperature TSF to an exponential decay cannot exist in finite D due to the presence of phonons. More importantly, we showed that the measured evolution of  from its high-temperature universal value towards a larger harmonic value harm = D/4+1/2, observed at low-temperatures, reflects in fact the gradual suppression of a population of localised defects with decreasing T . The relative importance of defects and plane waves explains the observed evolution of . Since harm is larger than its high-T value, we expect the latter exponent to dominate the long-time limit of the velocity decay at any finite temperature in the thermodynamic limit. In this view, the harmonic regime is only a transient which lasts longer at lower temperature when there are less defects. As a result, the mean-field critical temperature TSF has no analog in finite D. This implies that, at finite temperature, an instantaneous configuration of a finite dimensional glass-forming system cannot be seen as an inherent structure excited by small thermal fluctuations. It would be interesting to explore theoretical models alternative to mean-field glass models, such as elasto-plastic models [47], to account better for our numerical observations, in particular the value of the ex-

ponent .
Our results have broader physical consequences. First, they imply that the defect dynamics leading to the coarsening of the non-affine velocity field described in Ref. [32] (see also SI) is actually relevant for generic finite D glassforming liquids, and is unrelated to the athermal jamming transition. The observed universal exponent  implies similarly universal geometrical features of the potential energy landscapes of generic structural glasses.
Second, together with recent analytic and numerical works [33, 48], our results shed new light on the connection between equilibrium glassy dynamics and stationary points of the potential energy landscape. The interpretation of the mode-coupling temperature TMCT as a topographic change in the potential energy landscape does not hold in mixed p-spin models [33]. Our simulations of the Mari-Kurchan model confirm that the saddle-to-minima transition occurs at a temperature TSF distinct from TMCT, already at mean-field level. The emergence of localised defects in finite dimensions found here is consistent with the recent conclusion [48] that the critical transition at TSF is replaced in finite D by a smooth crossover. A similar scenario controlled by noninteracting localised defects was also found in kinetically constrained models [49], thus suggesting a potential connection between the defects revealed by steepest descent dynamics and those discussed in the context of dynamic facilitation [50].
Third, our finding that a finite concentration of defects controls the non-harmonic relaxation from equilibrated configurations to inherent states suggests that the potential energy landscape of glass-formers is both rugged and chaotic. To test this idea numerically, we applied a very small random perturbation to the initial configuration and monitored the subsequent steepest descent dynamics. We found that a slight perturbation typically leads to different inherent structures (not shown), consistent with earlier work [51, 52]. The strong chaoticity of the minimisation dynamics implies that the energy minimum reached from a given equilibrium configuration in fact strongly depends on the minimisation algorithm itself [53]. The steepest descent (SD) dynamics we used is just the simplest algorithm for numerical optimization, but there are several other (usually more efficient) ways to reach the bottom of the potential energy landscape, such as conjugate-gradient (CG) [54] and fast inertial relaxation engine (FIRE) [55]. Indeed, we find that starting from the same initial configuration, the SD, CG and FIRE dynamics typically converge to different inherent structures, as quantified by their mutual distances (see SI). The evolution of this distance mirrors the temperature evolution of the defect concentration in Fig. 4(a), higher initial temperatures leading to larger separations. In Fig. 5, we show representative snapshots of the displacement field between two inherent structures obtained by two different algorithms starting from a unique initial configuration. A single localised defects can be seen at low T , which naturally gives rise to a quadrupolar

mensionality dependence, including the mean-field limit, of this dynamics is studied by using the models in two-, three-, four-, eight-dimensions, and the mean-field MariKurchan model [38, 60].

Eshelby-like displacement field. Defects proliferate at higher temperature. This shows that mapping an equilibrium liquid state to an inherent structure is a fully dynamical problem, which becomes uniquely defined only after a specific choice for the minimisation algorithm is made. Localised defects, which had been used by Stillinger [56] to construct an argument against the existence of a Kauzmann transition (see the discussion in [57]), instead weaken the thermodynamic significance of a tiling of configuration space directly based on inherent states.
In recent years, localised glassy defects have been reported from the study of harmonic [29] and nonharmonic excitations, in the fields of plasticity [30] and low-temperature transport properties [28], and in connection with secondary relaxations in deeply supercooled liquids [58, 59] and dynamic facilitation [50]. Steepest descent dynamics thus has another situation where localised excitations control structural rearrangements at the particle scale. Future work should establish the similarities and differences between these disparate observations.

METHODS

The two- and three-dimensional soft sphere models [39, 40] consist of particles with purely repulsive interactions and a continuous size polydispersity. Particle diameters, di, are randomly drawn from a distribution of the form: f (d) = Ad-3, for d  [dmin, dmax], where A is a normalization constant. The size polydispersity is quantified by  = (d2 - d2)1/2/d, where the overline denotes an average over the distribution f (d). Here we choose  = 0.23 by imposing dmin/dmax = 0.449. The average diameter, d, sets the unit of length. The softsphere interactions are pairwise and described by an inverse power-law potential

where v0 sets the unit of energy (and of temperature with the Boltzmann constant kB  1) and = 0.2 quantifies the degree of nonadditivity of particle diameters. We introduce > 0 in the model to suppress fractionation and thus to enhance the glass-forming ability. The constants c0, c1 and c2 enforce a vanishing potential and continuity of its first- and second-order derivatives at the cut-off distance rcutoff = 1.25dij. We simulate a system with N particles within a square cell of area (volume) V = L2 (V = L3) where L is the linear box length, under periodic boundary conditions, at a number density  = N/V = 1 (1.02) for 2D (3D).
We prepare equilibrium configurations using the swap Monte Carlo algorithm [40]. With probability Pswap = 0.2, we perform a swap move where we randomly pick two particles (i and j) having similar diameters (|di - dj| < 0.2) and attempt to exchange their diameters. With probability 1 - Pswap = 0.8, instead, we perform conventional Monte Carlo translational moves, where we pick one particle and displace it within a box with linear length max = 0.12d.

A. Models
We study the steepest descent dynamics of models with three different interaction potentials: soft spheres, harmonic spheres, and Lennard-Jones interactions. The di-

where v0 is again the unit of the energy scale. For the two dimensional model, to avoid crystallisation at low temperature, we use the continuously polydisperse nonadditive model with the same distribution of the particle diameters used in the soft-sphere model and = 0.2 in two dimensions. The unit length scale for the twodimensional model is d as well as the soft-sphere model. We again use the swap Monte Carlo algorithm with the same setting and parameters as for the polydisperse soft spheres to equilibrate down to very low temperatures. In three, four, and eight dimensions, crystallisation is highly suppressed, and the simple additive ( = 0) monodisperse model is enough to study the relaxation dynamics to disordered states. Due to the finite range of the interaction, the system has a critical jamming transition at finite density, below which the relaxation dynamics shows an exponentially fast decay towards zero energy states [62]. Since in other models we study the relaxation dynamics towards energy minima with a finite energy, a direct comparison is possible when the inherent structures of harmonic spheres have finite energies as well. We thus set the volume fraction above the jamming transition to  = 1.2, 0.73, 0.5, 0.1 in two, three, four, and eight dimensions, respectively, so that the final energies are always finite.

3. Kob-Andersen Lennard-Jones model

For the case of the well-studied Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones (KALJ) model, the interaction between two particles has the following form:

(8)

for r < rcutoff = 2.5ij and particles i, j can belong to either A or B species which constitute the binary mixture. rcutoff is the cutoff distance at which the potential Uij(rij) is truncated. The different interaction parameters for the binary mixture take the following values: AA = 1.0, AB = 1.5 AA, BB = 0.5 AA; AA = 1.0, AB = 0.8AA, BB = 0.88AA. The mixture has 80:20 composition in 3D and 65:35 composition in 2D, to optimise glass-forming ability. In D = 2, we study a system consisting 125000 particles and for D = 3, we study a system of 76800 particles. Additionally, in D = 3, we study a system of 27135 particles to probe the quench dynamics of states sampled at a low temperature (T = 0.37), where configurations are obtained by a swap Monte Carlo scheme developed in Ref. [63].
4. Mari-Kurchan model

We study the mean-field Mari-Kurchan (MK) model [38, 60] in three dimensions with the simple monodisperse soft-sphere interaction in Eq. (5) with = 0 and the cutoff length rcutoff = 4d, where d is the diameter of particles. The volume fraction is  = 0.5. The MK model has quenched randomness in the particle distance, and the interaction potential is thus U (|ri - rj + Aij|), where Aij is a three-dimensional vector with each component sampled from the uniform distribution in the interval [0, L] (L the box size). Equilibrium configurations of the MK model are produced by using the planting technique [38, 64]. For systems with general isotropic interactions, the cubic shape of the box complicates the direct sampling of the random shifts from the Boltzmann distribution

P (Aij |rij ) =

exp(-Uij(|ri - rj + Aij dAij exp(-Uij(|ri - rj +

|)) Aij

|))

.

(9)

We thus use the Markov chain Monte Carlo method to sample the random shifts {Aij} from the distribution Eq. (9) so that any given particle configuration follows from the Boltzmann distribution. For each pair of particles i and j, we take Aij as the random shift after 200 Monte Carlo sweeps with the simple Metropolis algorithm starting from uniformly random numbers.

I. REPLICA LIQUID THEORY FOR THE MARI-KURCHAN (MK) MODEL

Thanks to the presence of the random shifts, the replica liquid theory can be applied to the MK model, which enables us to predict the dynamical transition in this model. This procedure is well established for the MK model with hard-sphere interactions [S1, S2], and the extension to soft spheres is straightforward. In the replica liquid theory, the cage size  is used as the order parameter, and the self-consistent equation of  for the 3D MK model can be written as

is the normalized gaussian function, and U (r) is the soft-sphere interaction potential

Eq.(5). The dynamical transition temperature TMCT is defined as the highest temperature at which the self-consistent

equation Eq. (S1) has a solution. We numerically solved this equation and obtained TMCT 0.0084 and  = 0.13 at

T = TMCT.

II. SYSTEM-SIZE DEPENDENCE OF THE VELOCITY DECAY

In finite size systems, the power-law decay of the velocity is always cut off after a finite time. To conclude whether or not the decay is algebraic in the thermodynamic limit, it is essential to study its system-size dependence. We show |v(t)| of the two-dimensional harmonic spheres, three-dimensional soft spheres, and four-dimensional harmonic spheres for several system sizes in Fig. S1 (a-c). In finite dimensions, as we discussed in Sec.II C, the velocity shows a power-law decay in the short time regime. When the system size increases, the cutoff time becomes longer, meaning that, in the thermodynamic limit N  , the power-law decay continues towards the long-time limit. We assume that the velocity decay follows a scaling form

|v(t)| = N -zF (t/N z),

where F (x) is the scaling function, and z is another exponent characterising the cutoff time scale. Figures S1 (d-f) show the scaling plot using Eq. (S3). We find roughly z 0.6 and 0.4 for velocity decay of the two-dimensional and three dimensional models at high temperature, respectively. In four- and eight-dimensional harmonic spheres in the high-temperature limit and the MK model at high temperature, we observe z 0.75. At very low temperature, where the harmonic exponent is observed, z 1 and z 0.33 in two and three dimensions, respectively.

III. HARMONIC EXPONENT

We discuss the asymptotic decay of the velocity by assuming that the system is perfectly harmonic and the vibra-
tional density of states follows the Debye law. Let the Hessian matrix H of an inherent structure have eigenvalues {a} and corresponding eigenvectors {xa}. Since the Hessian matrix is real symmetric, eigenvectors are orthogonal; xa · xb = ab, where ab is the Kronecker's delta. Using the eigenvectors, we have the particle displacement written as

r(t) = ca(t)xa,

(S4)

a

where ca(t) = r(t) · xa. Suppose that the system is perfectly harmonic, i.e. the system follows linearised equations of motion,

with f 0 the force vector of the inherent structure. Then each mode decays exponentially with ca(t) = ca(0)e-at

Let us assume that the density of state has the contributions from the phononic modes following the Debye law

(S7)

Therefore, the energy relaxation is dominated by t-D/2 when D  5. Since, for the steepest descent dynamics with the equations of motion given by Eq. (1), the energy decay can be related to the velocity decay, we finally obtain |v(t)|  t-harm with harm = D/4 + 1/2 for D  5.

IV. DEFINITION OF THE DEFECT FIELD
We explain how to identify defects and measure their concentration. We define the defect order parameter  based on the rearrangement of neighboring particles between the initial equilibrium and the final inherent structure configurations. Let us first imagine a perfect crystal quenched from a small, finite temperature to zero temperature. The two configurations before and after the quench should be essentially the same except for small thermal fluctuations. In this ideal situation, a given particle neither loses nor gains any neighbour during the quench dynamics. In that case, the defect order parameter should produce zero for all particles.
Instead, for a disordered liquid at finite temperature, the steepest descent dynamics involves collective rearrangements and a reshuffling of neighboring particles. When a given particle loses some of the neighboring particles, this process is referred to as a "bond-breaking", as studied extensively [S4, S5]. We then assign a positive value to the defect order parameter for a particle involved in a bond-breaking process. We also expect that particles can gain new

3

neighbours during the dynamics. Thus, a defect order parameter should also take into account this process which we

call a "bond-insertion". These two processes are sketched in Fig. S2.

To define neighboring particles in practice, we monitor the radial distribution functions in Fig. S3. We compute a

radial distribution function as a function of a normalized distance, xij = rij/dij, which is a suitable representation for continuously polydisperse systems [S6]. In this 2D polydisperse model, g(x) for the equilibrium state changes quite a

lot because the swap Monte Carlo allows us to sample an extremely wide range of temperatures. Consequently, the first local minimum of g(x), xEmQin, varies xEmQin  1.34 - 1.48 with varying temperature, T = 0.035 - 0.800. On the other hand, g(x) for the inherent structure barely changes except for the amplitude of the first peak. In particular,

the first local minimum is located in a nearly flat region (x  1.23 - 1.50).

Based on the observation of g(x), we consider the definition of neighbors for the bond-breaking process. For each

particle, we define the neighboring particles in the initial equilibrium configurations as particles located within a cutoff,

xEcuQt. We set xEcuQt = xEmQin. Similarly, we define neighboring particles in the inherent structure by introducing a cutoff xIcSut. Ideally, one would like to use again xIcSut = xEmQin, but then one finds that some neighbors have a displacement which is just above that threshold, and using the same xEmQin leads to false neighbor changes. Therefore, one needs to use xIcSut > xEcuQt to remove the false positives (see Fig. S2(a)), as already discussed in several previous studies [S4, S5]. Thus, we set xIcSut = 1.5.

Next, we consider the bond-insertion process. This can be viewed as a bond-breaking process for the time-reversal

of the minimisation dynamics. Applying the same reasoning as above, we impose the condition xIcSut < xEcuQt to remove the false positives. Thus we set xIcSut = 1.23.

Once neighbors are defined, we determine the list of neighbors for each particle in both equilibrium (Leq) and

inherent structure (LIS) configurations: Leq = {leq} and LIS = {lIS}, where leq and lIS denote the identities of the

neighbours. For each particle, say i, we define the number of bond breakings, Bi by counting particles with leq / LIS.

We also count the number of bond insertions, Ii, which is the number of particles with lIS / LEQ. We note that our

that the bond-breaking and bond-insertion processes take place with the same frequency, as expected.

Finally we define the defect order parameter i as follows: i = 1 if (Bi + Ii) > 0 and i = 0 if (Bi + Ii) = 0. It

is useful to make the variable i binary, as it allows us to determine the absolute concentration of defects, defined as

V. DISPLACEMENT FIELD
In Fig. S4, we show the displacement field |ri(t) - ri(t  )| at temperatures T = 0.2 and 0.035 and times t = 10-1, 100, 101, and 102. These two temperatures belong to the high- and low-temperature regimes, respectively (see Fig. 2(e)). At high temperature T = 0.2, the displacement field reveals many defects at short times. At longer timescales, the number of localised defects decreases, but some of them survive for a very long time. When a defect disappears, particles around the defect rearrange and the velocity |v(t)| has a large sudden increase. The time-evolution of the displacement field at high temperature is consistent with the coarsening picture studied in the

and we hardly see localised defects. This smooth displacement field is consistent with a harmonic description, as shown in Sec.II C.

1. Inherent structures from different algorithms

We show that localised defects affect the mapping between an equilibrium liquid microstate and a `corresponding' minimum in the energy landscape, i.e. an inherent structure. Starting from the same initial equilibrium state, we minimize the energy using different algorithms available in LAMMPS [S9], namely conjugate gradient, FIRE [S8], and steepest descent. This exercise is done for the 2D system of polydisperse soft spheres. In all cases, we use the same tolerance thresholds (energy tolerance of 10-16 and force tolerance of 10-20 [S10]) to end the convergence to a local minimum. After obtaining the minima corresponding to the same initial state via the three different algorithms, we compute the distance between the minima obtained for each pair of these algorithms, which is given

by

, where ri is the co-ordinate of the i-th particle in the configuration, and A,B represent

labels corresponding to CG, SD, or FIRE. If the pair of minima are identical, this distance should be very close to zero (and is only set by the convergence criterion).
However, this is not what we observe, as shown in Fig. S5. Instead we find that the average distance is not given by the convergence criterion (it is much larger), and it depends continuously upon the temperature from where the initial state is sampled; it is larger for higher temperatures.
Only at very low temperatures in finite systems do we find that instances where the pair of minima obtained from different algorithms can become similar, within numerical resolution. In those cases, the initial equilibrium state rolls down to the same minimum, independent of the algorithm used and the mapping between an equilibrium liquid state and a local minimum in the energy landscape becomes unique. However, when increasing the system size and/or the temperature, these minima are always distinct and we suspect that this is always the case in the thermodynamic limit at any finite temperature. The difference between pairs of minima obtained from a given initial configuration is visualized in the main text.
