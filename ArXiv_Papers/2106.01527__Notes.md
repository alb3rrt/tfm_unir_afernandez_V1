## Abstract

Scarparo has constructed counterexamples to Matui's HK-conjecture and Ortega and Scarparo have constructed counterexamples to the rational HK-conjecture. These counterexamples are essentially principal but not principal. In the present paper, a counterexample to the HK-conjecture that is principal is given. Like Scarparo's original counterexample, our counterexample is the transformation groupoid associated to a particular odometer. However, the relevant group is the fundamental group of a flat manifold (and hence is torsion-free) and the associated odometer action is free. The examples discussed here do satisfy the rational version of the HK-conjecture.
