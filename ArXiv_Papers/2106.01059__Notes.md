## Abstract

Photoinduced hyperthermia is a cancer therapy technique that induces death to cancerous cells via heat generated by plasmonic nanoparticles. While previous studies have shown that some nanoparticles are somewhat effective at killing cancer cells there is still room for improvement in terms of heating efficiency where a detailed and realistic thermoplasmonic study comparing different nanoparticles is still missing.Here we perform such a study, demonstrating that doughnut-shaped nanoparticles exhibit an outstanding tuneable photothermal response in realistic illumination conditions, i.e., partially polarized light. Furthermore, we show that nanoparticle heating in microfluidic environments, where nanoparticles experience free rotations, strongly depends on the particle orientation with respect to the illumination source, a variable often neglected in photothermal applications. We conclude that heating of nanodoughnuts depends weakly on orientation and therefore, are foreseen ideal candidates for photothermal therapy applications. Finally, we present a nanodoughnut fabrication guide, covering a wide range of toroid designs, which can help on its experimental implementation.
