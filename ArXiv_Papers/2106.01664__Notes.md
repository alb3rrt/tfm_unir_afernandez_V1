## Abstract

Translationally invariant finetuned single-particle lattice Hamiltonians host flat bands only. Suitable short-range many-body interactions result in complete suppression of particle transport due to local constraints and Many-Body Flatband Localization. Heat can still flow between spatially locked charges. We show that heat transport is forbidden in dimension one. In higher dimensions heat transport can be unlocked by tuning filling fractions across a percolation transition for suitable lattice geometries. Transport in percolation clusters is additionally affected by effective bulk disorder and edge scattering induced by the local constraints, which work in favor of arresting the heat flow. We discuss explicit examples in one and two dimensions.
