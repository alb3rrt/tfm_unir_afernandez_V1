## Abstract

We study the inverse random source problem for the time-space fractional diffusion equation driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H\in(0,1)$. With the aid of a novel estimate, by using the operator approach we propose regularity analyses for the direct problem. Then we provide a reconstruction scheme for the source terms $f$ and $g$ up to the sign. Next, combining the properties of Mittag-Leffler function, the complete uniqueness and instability analyses are provided. It's worth mentioning that all the analyses are unified for $H\in(0,1)$.
