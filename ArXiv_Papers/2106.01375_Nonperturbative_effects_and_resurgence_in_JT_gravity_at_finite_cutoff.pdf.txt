Abstract: We investigate the nonperturbative structure of Jackiw­Teitelboim gravity at finite cutoff, as given by its proposed formulation in terms of a T T¯-deformed Schwarzian quantum mechanics. Our starting point is a careful computation of the disk partition function to all orders in the perturbative expansion in the cutoff parameter. We show that the perturbative series is asymptotic and that it admits a precise completion exploiting the analytical properties of its Borel transform, as prescribed by resurgence theory. The final result is then naturally interpreted in terms of the nonperturbative branch of the T T¯-deformed spectrum. The finite-cutoff trumpet partition function is computed by applying the same strategy. In the second part of the paper, we propose an extension of this formalism to arbitrary topologies, using the basic gluing rules of the undeformed case. The Weil­Petersson integrations can be safely performed due to the nonperturbative corrections and give results that are compatible with the flow equation associated with the T T¯ deformation. We derive exact expressions for general topologies and show that these are captured by a suitable deformation of the Eynard­Orantin topological recursion. Finally, we study the "slope" and "ramp" regimes of the spectral form factor as functions of the cutoff parameter.

1 Introduction
A crucial problem in quantum gravity is the precise definition of physical observables. Asymptotic quantities, such as the S-matrix in Minkowski space or boundary correlators in AdS, are pretty well understood. Still, it seems essential to extend the set of computable quantities, especially when black holes and cosmological aspects are involved. A direct attempt to obtain more "local" observables would consist of defining quantum gravity in a box, imposing suitable boundary conditions on the metric at some finite spatial extent. In the AdS/CFT correspondence, this program should imply the extension of the holographic dictionary to gravitational theories defined on bounded regions of spacetime.
Unexpectedly, the renewed interest in a class of solvable irrelevant deformations of two-dimensional CFTs, known as the T T¯ deformations [1­3], has suggested an innovative
­1­

strategy to address the above issue, at least in low dimensions. It was proposed in [4] (see also [5]) that T T¯-deformed CFTs could realize the holographic dual of AdS3 gravities on a finite patch. The crucial element in favor of this conjectured duality is that the conformal Ward identity of the relevant CFT translates, in the presence of the deformation, into a second-order functional differential equation that closely resembles the Wheeler­DeWitt equation of AdS3 gravity. This observation suggests a possible identification between the wave functionals of gravitational theories in d + 1 dimensions and partition functions of ddimensional nontrivially-deformed QFTs. This correspondence has been checked in various ways [6­8], but the consistency of the proposal is still under scrutiny. An unsatisfying feature of this duality is that for large enough energies, the spectrum of the deformed boundary theory becomes complex, implying a potential breakdown of unitarity for the bulk theory. A different and maybe related problem is to better understand the flow induced by the T T¯ deformation from the holographic point of view, as coming from integrating out a portion of the asymptotic geometry.
While there have been attempts to generalize the conjecture to higher dimensions [9], a simpler context, where we can accurately study the status of the proposal, is to consider the finite cutoff version of Jackiw­Teitelboim (JT) gravity [10, 11]. In its modern formulation [12], the JT path integral itself is defined as a limit procedure from a cut-off theory: after imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions at some finite distance, the proper boundary length and the boundary value for the dilaton are scaled appropriately in the large area limit to preserve the boundary degrees of freedom. In so doing, JT gravity reduces to a solvable one-dimensional theory, the Schwarzian quantum mechanics [13­15]. The natural expectation is that at finite cutoff the relevant dual formulation is provided by a T T¯-deformed version of such a theory [16, 17].
The partition function of JT gravity restricted on a finite AdS2 subregion has been computed in [18], using two different approaches based on either canonical or path-integral quantization1. The results of both methods are mutually consistent and are directly related to the T T¯ deformation of the Schwarzian theory. An important issue addressed in [18] concerns the spectrum of the deformed theory, which complexifies above a certain energy threshold. As a consequence, the na¨ive integration prescription does not generate a welldefined partition function. A consistent partition function can be obtained instead by adding contributions originating from a nonperturbative branch, but the related spectral density becomes not positive definite, calling for a physical interpretation. Moreover, in the analysis of [18], the nonperturbative completion seems to be accompanied by certain ambiguities that the authors cannot wholly fix in their approach. Last but not least, the construction of partition functions for arbitrary topologies configurations, relevant for the nonperturbative definition of JT gravity itself [20, 21], is left unexplored.
In this paper, we reexamine JT gravity at finite cutoff, starting from its definition in terms of the T T¯-deformed Schwarzian quantum mechanics. We begin by studying the T T¯ flow purely at a perturbative level and compute the entire perturbative series associated with the deformation parameter, both for the disk and the trumpet partition functions. We

­2­

find that the resulting series has a vanishing radius of convergence and, as such, requires an appropriate nonperturbative completion. We then exploit the standard resurgence technique [22, 23], using the properties of the lateral Borel resummation, to take into account nonperturbative contributions. This procedure unambiguously brings into the game the nonperturbative configurations associated with the new energy branch and prescribes the correct integration contour. For the disk topology, we obtain the partition function in terms of a modified Bessel function of the first type, an expression already considered in [18]. The energy spectrum naturally spans a finite interval; however, the associated spectral density is not positive definite. The trumpet partition function experiences an even more dramatic modification: the nonperturbative corrections completely smooth out na¨ive singularity associated with the fact that the cutoff boundary could overlap with the geodesic boundary.
Relying on this observation, in the second part of the paper, we explore the construction of the deformed version of the partition functions for arbitrary topologies, using the same gluing procedure derived for the undeformed theory [20]. We remark that without the nonperturbative corrections, the relevant gluing integral would be ill-defined. The gluing procedure results in a consistent deformation of the standard Eynard­Orantin recursion relations [24] associated with the original theory: the deformed spectral curve and the higher-genus correlation functions are fully compatible with the flow equation of the T T¯ deformation, and we find a precise mapping that encodes the flow. We stress that the non-positivity of the input spectral density does not spoil the consistency of the recursion relations, although its actual physical interpretation is still missing in our case. An essential step in our construction is the explicit evaluation of the cylinder partition function: it is closely related to the kernel necessary to engineer the Eynard­Orantin topological recursion formula [24] and is responsible for the "ramp" growth in the spectral form factor [20, 25, 26]. We derive in this last perspective its late-time behavior and observe the transition between the slope and the ramp phase at finite cutoff. Quite interestingly, the change of regime does not seem to depend on the value of the finite cutoff.
The paper is structured as follows. We start in Section 2 by briefly reviewing some generalities on JT gravity and its T T¯ deformation. Subsequently, in Section 3, we compute the perturbative series arising from the deformation and its completion using the theory of resurgence, both for the disk and the trumpet. Section 4 is devoted to the spectral properties of the deformed theory: the relevant partition functions are seen arising from a compact spectrum and computed with a suitable integration contour. The spectral density is derived and found to be not positive defined. In Section 5 we construct the partition functions for arbitrary topologies, exploiting the gluing prescription of the undeformed theory. The consistency of this construction with the T T¯ flow equation is discussed in Section 6. The extension of the Eynard­Orantin recursion relations in the deformed case is presented in Section 7, opening the possibility to interpret holographically the theory at finite cutoff. Finally, in Section 8, we study the deformed spectral form factor, deriving the behavior of the "slope" and "ramp" regimes. Section 9 presents our conclusion and the possible extensions of this work. A couple of technical appendices complete the manuscript.

2 Basics of JT gravity and its T T¯ deformation

JT gravity is a two-dimensional theory of gravity whose dynamical fields are the metric and a dilaton field . The theory, placed on a generic orientable two-dimensional manifold , is governed by the action

is a purely topological term that computes the Euler characteristic (). In the present work, we consider the Euclidean theory with Dirichlet boundary condi-
tions imposed on the fields: the n connected components of the boundary  have assigned lengths 1/ , . . . , n/ , while the dilaton is taken to have constant value b = r/ along each boundary component. Such a theory has been extensively studied in the double scaling limit  0, where plays the role of a "holographic renormalization" parameter. The dilaton field acts as a Lagrange multiplier enforcing the constraint R = -2 and thus fixing the bulk geometry. Once integrated out, the nontopological part of the action reduces to a boundary term.
The only topology supporting classical solutions is the disk (see Figure 1), where the single boundary cuts out some inner region of Euclidean AdS2 with length / . In the
 0 limit, the theory reduces to the boundary dynamics of a single reparametrization mode () with Schwarzian action

A topology that plays a crucial role in constructing results for generic manifolds is the

trumpet (see Figure 1), which differs from the disk by the presence of a geodesic boundary

of length b. The additional boundary can be taken into account by considering a disk with

a hyperbolic defect in the bulk [27]. This choice leads to a Boltzmann integral with a

It was then argued [18] that the deformed Schwarzian theory is the holographic dual of JT gravity at finite cutoff, establishing a correspondence between the T T¯ deformation
parameter t and the bulk gravity cutoff . For finite values of the boundary length, as the
boundary of  is pushed away from the asymptotic boundary of AdS2 and into the bulk, the boundary theory flows accordingly.

3 Disk and trumpet
This section is devoted to studying both the disk and the trumpet partition functions for the theory at finite cutoff.
2The T T¯ deformation parameter t is defined is such a way to match the expansion parameter -b 2 that we will use for the bulk theory. To match the conventions of [16­18], one should set t = 4/r.
3The integrals (2.8) and (2.9) are actually ill-defined if the integration region spans the entire positive line. In [18], it was suggested to Wick-rotate the bare parameters of the theory to make sense of these integrals. In the following, we shall choose a different approach to address this issue.

­5­

At infinite cutoff, the parameter is introduced to take the double-scaling limit where both the boundary length and the value of the dilaton on the boundary diverge, while their ratio u = /r remains constant. In principle, when considering the theory at finite cutoff,
becomes redundant since the theory should only depend on its bare parameters. However, as mentioned in Section 2, plays an important role, as it parametrizes the deviation from the infinite cutoff limit and is the analog of the deformation parameter t = 2/2r in the T T¯-deformed Schwarzian theory. Moreover, the starting point of our analysis is to study the theory from the point of view of its perturbative expansion in t. For this reason, throughout most of the paper, we will find it convenient to express the results in terms u and t.
With a simple change of variables, we can recast the disk and the trumpet partition functions in (2.8) and (2.9) as

Zdisk(u, t)

=

1 22


ds s sinh(2s) e-I(u,t;s) ,

(3.1) (3.2)

where the t-deformed action reads

I(u, t; s)

=

u t

1-

1 - ts2

.

(3.3)

For anyt > 0, the part of the action (3.3) depending on s becomes imaginary in the region s  (1/ t, +) and the integral diverges. Moreover, the expression above is ambiguous as it is not clear a priori which of the two branches of the square root one should take when crossing the branch point at s = 1/ t. As we will see in the following, these aspects ultimately signal the presence of non-analytic (namely instanton-like) contributions in the parameter t, and care should be taken in choosing the correct prescription to take these into account and make sense of the integrals above.

3.1 Perturbative expansion
Despite the possible ambiguities in defining the integrals (3.1) and (3.2), they can be used to yield well-defined asymptotic series in t for the partition functions. This is achieved by first expanding the exponential term as


e-I(u,t;s) = e-us2/2 1 + An(s, u) tn .
n=1

(3.4)

The coefficients An can be expressed in terms of generalized Laguerre polynomials,

An(s,

u)

(3.5)

­6­

In Appendix A, we show in detail how the expression above is derived. By integrating each term in the series, we rewrite the partition functions as


Zdisk(u, t) = Zndisk(u) tn ,
n=0 
Ztrumpet(u, b, t) = Zntrumpet(u, b) tn .
n=0

(3.6) (3.7)

The t0 terms come from taking the integral against the undeformed action factorized in (3.4) and, as such, correctly reproduce the known results computed in the t  0 limit [20],

For n > 1 we have the following expressions:

(3.10) (3.11)

For any n  N, the above integrals are real and convergent. By expanding in t, we have apparently cured the ambiguity arising from the integration over s. We will see in a moment where the subtlety is now hiding. We first need to perform the integration. In order to deal with both integrals at once, we compute

Conveniently, the two expressions above capture also the n = 0 cases in (3.8) and (3.9).

In both cases, the perturbative coefficients are the undeformed partition functions times a

polynomial in 1/u of degree 3n. Finally, we must remark that these two series expansions

can also be directly obtained by solving the flow equation perturbatively in t (see Section 6

for some details) without making any reference to the integral representations (3.1) and

(3.2).

3.2 Resurgence

The coefficients in (3.13) and (3.14) grow asymptotically as n!. This means that the perturbative expansions in (3.6) and (3.7) should be understood as formal power series, since both have vanishing radius of convergence. It is possible to associate a finite result to these series by performing a Borel resummation.
The Borel sum of a series

(z) = n zn
n

(3.15)

is defined as follows. First, one should take the Borel transform of ,

B[]() =

n

n n!

.

n

(3.16)

If the coefficients n grow as n!, B[] has finite radius of convergence, thus defining a germ of an analytic function at  = 0. Then, the directional Borel resummation of  along a

chosen direction  on the complex -plane is defined as

S (z )

=

1 z

ei 
d e-/z B[]() ,
0

(3.17)

where the integral, taken along the ray with arg  = , is also known as a directional Laplace

transform. The directional resummation S(z) defines an analytic function in the wedge Re(e-iz) > 0 that, upon expansion in z, reproduces (3.15).

In our case, rather than directly computing the Borel transform of (3.6) and (3.7), it is

convenient to use the power series representation of the Kummer confluent hypergeometric

function to first recast (3.13) and (3.14) as

(3.20) (3.21)

Now, in order to complete the Borel summation and obtain an analytic expression for the formal series in (3.6) and (3.7) one should proceed as in (3.17). However, the hypergeometric functions appearing in the Borel transforms (3.20) and (3.21) have branch cuts located on the positive real axis in the range   (2u, +). The branch cut identifies a Stokes line at arg  = 0, i.e. a singular direction in the  plane. Namely, when taking a directional Laplace transform at  = 0, one runs into an ambiguity since the results obtained by approaching the Stokes line from above and below differ.
In the theory of resurgence, Stokes lines are associated with nonperturbative contributions, encoded by the discontinuity (S+ - S-) (z) in the directional Borel resummation as the ray of angle  crosses the Stokes line at  . The directional Borel resummations approaching the Stokes lines from both sides are usually referred to as lateral Borel resummations. Because of the nonperturbative nature of the discontinuity, both S+(z) and S-(z) share the same expansion in z, but crucially differ by instantonic contributions. In general, the correct nonperturbative completion of (z) is obtained by choosing some combination of the two. If  is real and the Stokes line lies at  = 0, under some general assumptions the correct real completion of (z) is given by the median resummation

Through resurgence, we have been able to unambiguously fix the nonperturbative com-
pletions of both the disk and the trumpet partition functions with just their perturbative
expansions at t = 0 as inputs. These corrections naturally carry the information of the nonperturbative branch H- of the T T¯ deformation in (2.7).

4 The spectrum
The results for the disk and the trumpet partition functions obtained in (3.27) and (3.28) through resurgence can be reproduced by changing the prescription for the integration contour in (3.1) and (3.2). At the level of the boundary theory, this prescription induces a cutoff on the spectrum for any finite value of t and gives rise to instantonic contributions associated with a region in the spectrum where the density of states becomes negative. The present section is dedicated to discussing these aspects.

4.1 Integration contour





The action (3.3) has two branch points, located at s = -1/ t and s = +1/ t. We can

extend the definition of I(t, u; s) to the complex s-plane by placing a branch cut in the interval s  (-1/ t, +1/ t). Then, we can replace the original contour, running along the

real axis, with an integration contour S surrounding the branch as depicted in Figure 3.

4.2 The density of states

The prescription on the integration contour S translates into a prescription for the inte-

gration over the spectrum of the boundary theory. Changing the integration variable to

E = s2 brings the disk partition function into the form



Zdisk(u, t) =

1/t sinh 2

dE
0

42

E





e-u(1- 1-tE)/t - e-u(1+ 1-tE)/t .

(4.14)

The above differs from the na¨ive integral (2.8) associated with the T T¯-deformed Schwarzian theory in two ways: the integration range is now capped at E = 1/t, and there is an additional term of instantonic origin. The spectrum is always real within the integration range, and in the t  0 limit, one recovers the undeformed Schwarzian partition function.
The deformed density of states (E; t) can be obtained as follows. We split the exponential terms into two separate integrals and apply on both an appropriate change of variables to obtain integrals of the type

dE (E; t) e-ruE ,

(4.15)

where the density of states is weighted by a Boltzmann factor with inverse temperature  = ru. This amounts to set

E

=

1 - rt

 ± 1 - tE - 1

,

E

=

1 t

1 - (1 - rtE)2

.

(4.16)

The the two integrals combine nicely as

Zdisk(u, t) = =

1/(r t)
dE (E; t) e-ruE -
0
2/(r t)
dE (E; t) e-ruE ,
0

1/(r t)
dE (E; t) e-ruE

where the t-deformed density of states is given by

sinh

E (E )

dE (E ) dE

=

r(1 - trE) 22

sinh

2

rE(2 - trE)

.

(4.18)

Here and in the following, whenever we Laplace-transform from u to E, we adopt the widely-used convention of setting r = 1/2. With this choice, the density of states reads

(E; t) =

1 - tE/2 42

sinh

2

E(1 - tE/4)

.

(4.19)

To interpret the integral as a conventional Laplace transform we simply extend the integration range to the entire real positive E axis and define (E; t) to have support on the intervalE  (0, 4/t). At t = 0, the above reproduces the familiar Schwarzian density   sinh(2 E) growing exponentially in E. At finite t, the result is qualitatively rather

­ 13 ­

different. In the "perturbative range" 0 < E < 2/t the density is positive, but after an initial growth it decreases and reaches a zero at E = 2/t. In the "nonperturbative range" 2/t < E < 4/t the density becomes negative; the two ranges are related by the symmetry property (4/t - E, t) = -(E; t) and thus the integral of (E; t) over the entire spectrum vanishes.

5 Other topologies

The disk partition function Zdisk(u, t) computed in the previous sections is the partition function associated with a manifold of genus zero whose boundary has a single connected component of (rescaled) length u,

Z0,1(u; t) = Zdisk(u, t) .

(5.1)

In general, one can compute partition functions on orientable manifolds with arbitrary

topology. These are classified by the number n of connected components of the boundary,

and by the genus g. The resulting partition function, Zg,n will depend on the lengths u1, . . . , un of the connected boundaries.
In a theory of quantum gravity, the path integral receives contributions from different

spacetime topologies. Such a property sometimes goes under the name of "third quantiza-

tion". This means that, for any given choice of n, the full partition function should really

be a sum over the Zg,n obtained for any value of the genus g. Each term is weighted by the topological (Einstein­Hilbert) action term that gives a factor of (eS0), where  = 2-2g-n

is the Euler characteristic. At fixed n the full partition function reads


Zn(u1, . . . , un; t) = e(2-n)S0 e-2gS0 Zg,n(u1, . . . , un; t) .
g=0

(5.2)

In [20], it was shown that the partition function Zg,n for a generic choice of n and g can be obtained in terms of a certain topological decomposition. Each boundary component of length ui is associated with a trumpet Ztrumpet(ui, bi, t) that is glued to a bordered Riemann surface of genus g through a common geodesic boundary of length bi. In Figure 5, we show the simple case of Z1,1. The gluing is performed by taking an integral over the length bi of each geodesic boundary,

Zg,n(u1, . . . , un; t) =





db1 b1 . . . dbn bn Vg,n(b1, . . . , bn)

0

0

× Ztrumpet(u1, b1, t) . . . Ztrumpet(un, bn, t) .

(5.3)

The formula is written in terms of Vg,n(b1, . . . , bn), the Weil­Petersson volume of the moduli

space of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces of genus g with n geodesic boundaries of lengths

b1, . . . , bn. The Weil­Petersson volume can be represented as an integral over the Deligne­

Mumford compactification Mg,n of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of genus g and

n marked points pi,

where  is the Weil­Petersson symplectic form and i the first Chern class of the line bundle whose fiber is the cotangent space at pi. We refer the reader to [28] for an introduction on the subject.
Besides the disk, the only other topology that represents an exception to the formula above is given by the cylinder



Z0,2(u1, u2; t) =

db b Ztrumpet(u1, b, t) Ztrumpet(u2, b, t) ,

0

(5.5)

which is obtained by directly gluing together two trumpets along their geodesic boundary, as shown in Figure 4.
In principle, it is not obvious why the gluing prescription should still be valid at finite t. In fact, for any t > 0, there is a portion of the integration range where the length b of the geodesic boundary exceeds the length u/ t of the Dirichlet boundary of the same trumpet. However, as already noticed in [18], the inclusion of nonperturbativeterms had the effect of making the trumpet partition function in (3.28) regular at b = u/ t and real across the entire integration range, thus making the integral well-defined. Although we do not have an ab initio derivation of (5.3) and (5.5) for finite t, we take these formulas as prescriptions for the computation of partition functions for any topology. We will show later that the results they generate have remarkable properties.

a crucial feature of the theory at finite cutoff.

When continuing the resolvent to arbitrary complex values of E1 and E2, the square roots in (5.16) induce branch cuts at E1  (0, 4/t) and E2  (0, 4/t). The double-discontinuity of the resolvent across the real E1 and E2 lines, appropriately normalized by a -1/(42) factor, gives the two-point correlator of the density (E; t),

0,2(E1, E2; t)

=

t2(1 - tE1/2)(1 - tE2/2)(tE12/4 + tE22/4 - E1 - E2) 42[(1 - tE1/2)2 - (1 - tE2/2)2]2 E1E2(1 - tE1/4)(1 - tE2/4)

.

(5.17)

Interestingly, its support coincides with the one computed for the one-point function of (E; t) in (4.19), obtained from the disk partition function. In fact, the above expression is valid within the ranges where the branch cuts extend, i.e. for E1  (0, 4/t) or E1  (0, 4/t). Outside those ranges, 0,2 vanishes, since the double discontinuity of the resolvent R0,2 is zero.

5.2 The general case

The Weil­Petersson volume Vg,n is a polynomial of degree 3g - 3 + n in the squared lengths b21, . . . , b2n of the geodesic boundaries. By linearity, (5.3) can be computed by splitting the contribution of each monomial as a product of integrals where a single Ztrumpet(u, b, t) is
integrated against some even power of b. It is sufficient to use



Z~m(u, t) =

db b Ztrumpet(u, b, t) b2m

0

=

m! 
t

2mum+1e-u/t Im

u t

(5.18)

to read off Zg,n from the coefficients in the polynomial Vg,n. Moreover, we can use the representation of Vg,n in (5.4) as an integral over Mg,n together with (5.18) to recast (5.3) as6

=

1 tn/2

(5.20)

A similar approach can be used to compute generic resolvents Rg,n(E1, . . . , En; t). Instead of taking an integral transform of the result Zg,n(u1, . . . , un; t), it is possible to first apply the transformation to a single trumpet. This generates a term, for E < 0,

6 Flow equation

The shift in the spectrum of the T T¯-deformed theory as a function of the deformation parameter is controlled by (2.6). The equation imposes a constraint at the level of the thermal partition function, in the form of a partial differential equation in both the deformation parameter t and the (rescaled) temperature u. In fact, the differential operator

F(u,

t)

=

u

2 u2

 t

(6.1)

has the property that, for any density of states (E),





F(u, t)

dE (E ) e-u(1- 1-tE)/t = 0 .

0

This induces a recursion relation

(6.2)

2u(n + 1) Zn+1(u) = 2n Zn(u) - 2nu Zn(u) - u2Zn(u)

(6.3)

for both the disk and the trumpet coefficients in the t-expansion introduced in Section 3.1. A simple check on the explicit forms derived in (3.13) and (3.14) shows that, indeed, the above holds true.

­ 19 ­

With the introduction of nonperturbative corrections, however, the integral of the type in (6.2) should be modified according to the prescriptions discussed in Section 4.2. Interestingly, the modified integral is still a solution of the flow equation,

1/t





F(u, t)

dE (E ) e-u(1- 1-tE)/t - e-u(1+ 1-tE)/t = 0 .

0

(6.4)

As a consequence, both (3.27) and (3.28) are solutions of the flow equation, as one can

explicitly check. The nonperturbative contributions to both the disk and the trumpet

partition function correct the perturbative series with the addition of a trans-series term

of the form


Zinst.(u, t) = e-2u/t Zn(u) tn .

(6.5)

n=0

The presence of the exponential associated with the instantonic saddle has the effect of

modifying the action of the flow equation operator by flipping the sign of u,


F(u, t) Zinst.(u, t) = -e-2u/t F(-u, t) Zn(u) .

(6.6)

n=0

As a consequence, the coefficients Zn(u) of the expansion about the instantonic saddle obey the modified equation

2u(n + 1) Zn+1(u) = -2n Zn(u) + 2nu Zn (u) + u2Zn (u) .

(6.7)

The fact that the trumpet partition function is annihilated by F(u, t) has important implications at g > 0. In fact, let us consider the gluing formula (5.3) for n = 1. Since the dependence on u and t comes exclusively from the single Ztrumpet(u, b, t) inside the integral, we can immediately conclude that the disk partition function is a solution of the flow equation, not just at genus zero, but at any genus g:

F(u, t) Zg,1(u; t) = 0 .

(6.8)

A similar conclusion can be drawn for other topologies, i.e. when n > 1, but it requires a modification in the way we assign boundary conditions. So far, we considered a specific way of assigning Dirichletboundary conditions. Specifically, we imposed on each boundary the same value b = 1/ t for the dilaton field. In principle, nothing prevents us from computing higher topologies by gluing trumpets associated with different values of t. The generalization for the gluing formulas presented in Section 5 is actually straightforward, and so is the generalization of the result written in terms of the building blocks (5.18). This is effectively a refinement of the results considered so far, since for any given topology, the generalized partition function Zg,n is now a function of n different deformation parameters t1, . . . , tn. At the level of the flow equation, to each boundary is associated a differential operator F(ui, ti) which annihilates the partition function:

F(ui, ti) Zg,n(u1, . . . , un; t1, . . . , tn) = 0 .

(6.9)

For the purpose of the present paper, we will not consider further this refinement, and we will only deal with the case where the dilaton field takes the same value on each disconnected component of the boundary.

7 Topological recursion

In Section 5, we have given a prescription to obtain the resolvents Rg,n for any topology. At t = 0, these functions have a natural interpretation in terms of correlators computed in a certain dual double-scaled Hermitian matrix integral [20]. The correlators enjoy Schwinger­ Dyson-like identities, known as loop equations, that allow to recursively compute results at all orders in the large-N expansion [29]. This procedure goes under the name of topological recursion, and the set of data initiating it can be captured by a single mathematical object: the spectral curve [30].
Thanks to the simplicity of the undeformed trumpet partition function (3.9), at t = 0 the resolvents Rg,n are, essentially, the Laplace transforms of the Weil­Petersson volumes Vg,n. In fact, the undeformed topological recursion [20] is given precisely by the recursion formula of Eynard and Orantin [24], which is the Laplace-transformed version of the recursion formula derived by Mirzakhani [31].
Remarkably, we find that the deformation induced by t represents a consistent deformation of the spectral curve. By this, we mean that the resolvents Rg,n computed through the Weil­Petersson gluing, as described in Section 5, can be reproduced by the topological recursion associated with a t-deformation of the Eynard­Orantin spectral curve capturing the t = 0 case.
To define the spectral curve we introduce the map

E(z) = -z2 ,

(7.1)

which, in turn, determines the functions

The functions Wg,n computed by the recursion are closely related to the resolvents Rg,n. Specifically, one can obtain the former by simply acting on the latter with the change of variables induced by E(z),

Wg,n(z1, . . . , zn; t) = Rg,n(E(z1), . . . , E(zn); t) E (z1) . . . E (zn) .

(7.6)

As such, Wg,n can be computed, from a bulk perspective, through the gluing (5.3). In the spirit of Section 5, we define

W~ m(z, t) = R~m(E, t) E (z)

=

(2m

(7.7)

which provides the contribution associated with a single trumpet integrated against b2m. To prove that the topological recursion (7.4) indeed matches the results obtained in
Section 5, we will show that the Wg,n(z1, . . . , zn; t) are connected to the undeformed ones, Wg,n(z1, . . . , zn; 0), through a change of variables.8 A simple way to show this is to consider an alternative choice for the map E. In particular, we consider a map with an explicit dependence on t,

E^ ( )

=

2 -t

1 + t2 - 1 ,

(7.9)

7There are more general formulations of the topological recursion. The formulas in (7.4) and (7.5) are valid for a map E such that dE vanishes at z = 0, where its local Galois involution is  : z  -z.
8As it is clear from the definitions in (7.2), (7.3) and (7.6), the functions Wg,n transform as a differential n-forms. In fact, the spectral curve and the topological recursion are naturally formulated in terms of differential forms

g,n(z1, . . . , zn) = Wg,n(z1, . . . , zn) dz1  . . .  dzn .

(7.8)

The recursion kernel K, on the other hand, defines a tensor of type (1, 1).

­ 22 ­

This choice has two important properties. The first is that it correctly reproduces the undeformed map when t vanishes, i.e. limt0 E^() = E(). The second is that it eliminates
any dependence from t in W0,1 and W0,2, which then necessarily agree with the undeformed
ones. Specifically,

W^ 0,1(1)

=

1

sin(21) 2

= W0,1(1; 0) ,

W^ 0,2(1, 2)

=

(1

1 - 2)2

= W0,2(1, 2; 0) .

(7.10)

The same, then, holds true for the recursion kernel

K^ (1,

)

=

 csc(2) 12 - 2

= K(1, ; 0) .

(7.11)

As anticipated at the beginning of this section, the undeformed recursion induced by (7.10) and (7.11) is the Eynard­Orantin topological recursion, while the undeformed Wg,n are connected to the Weil­Petersson volumes Vg,n by a simple integral transform, as it can be easily seen from the expression of the integrated trumpet

W^~ m(z) = (2m + 1)! z-2m-2 = W~ m(z, 0) .

(7.12)

We can therefore argue as follows. We start from the undeformed case, where the recursion formula is known to hold, and we notice that all quantities can be lifted to the case of finite t through the change of variables induced by E  E^-1. Because the recursion formula (7.4) is covariant under change of variables induced by maps that are bi-holomorphic in some neighborhood of z = 0, the topological recursion is guaranteed to hold at any finite t.
As an example, we notice that both the recursion and the standard gluing procedure give, for the disk at genus one,

W1,1(z1; t)

=

(2

+ tz12) [6 + 2z12 (4 + tz12)] 3z14 (4 + tz12)5/2

8 The spectral form factor

At t = 0 [20], JT gravity was observed to reproduce the characteristic shape of a spectral form factor associated with an ensemble of Hamiltonians with random-matrix statistics. From a bulk perspective, the spectral form factor can be interpreted as a transition amplitude in the Hilbert space of two copies of JT gravity [26]. It is computed by the analytic continuation of two boundaries, u1  u + i , u2  u - i , which introduces a timescale  . The quantity includes terms coming from different topologies, each weighted by the usual topological factor,

F (u,  ; t) = e2S0 Z0,1(u + i ; t) Z0,1(u - i ; t) + Z0,2(u + i, u - i ; t) + . . . ,

Interestingly, different features of the spectral form factor are associated with contributions coming from different topologies. The initial "slope" region comes from considering two disjoint disks (3.24). The characteristic shape of the slope can be observed by looking at its large- regime,

(8.3)

The first term gives a cubic decay that reproduces the known t  0 limit, while the second term is an oscillation of period t whose amplitude is exponentially suppressed in 1/t.
Eventually, the slope phase will end, and other topologies will dominate the form factor. The characteristic "ramp" region comes, in fact, from the connected topology, i.e., from the cylinder (5.11), which represents a Euclidean wormhole connecting the two boundaries. The large- behavior is again dominated by two terms,

slope, and in particular, of its decaying character, has been interpreted probabilistically.

As the time  increases, the amplitude for the time evolved Hartle­Hawking state to have a

small Einstein­Rosen bridge decreases, being mostly supported at large values of the bridge

length. The relevant initial state is localized at small Einstein­Rosen bridge lengths, and

thus the transition amplitude decreases with  . The exchange of a baby universe instead

explains the ramp in the spectral form factor: at late times  , Euclidean wormholes allow

transitions from the initial Hartle­Hawking state to a state with a short Einstein­Rosen

bridge and a large baby universe, with a size of order  . The amplitude for this process,

while exponentially small in the entropy, does not decay as  increases, and the linear

growth comes from the  different ways in which the baby universe can be rotated before

being absorbed [26].

At finite cutoff, we see from (8.3) and (8.4) that with respect to the undeformed

case, the leading  -behaviours are diminished by exponential finite-size effects while novel

periodic fluctuations appear. We observe that both the ramp term (8.4) and the slope

(8.3) share the same damping factor in the non-oscillating part, which indeed suggests we

are capturing a universal effect of gravity at finite volume and confirms our result for the

cylinder partition function. As a matter of fact, the intersection of these two regimes is

independent of the cutoff parameter t, up to exponentially-suppressed terms, leading to a

transition time of order9

  (2u)1/4eS0/2 .

(8.5)

In Figure 8, the spectral form factor is plotted as a function of  for various values of t. A more physical understanding of the late-time behavior at finite cutoff should come
from repeating the analysis of [26] using the real Hartle­Hawking wave function obtained

9The numerical factors are due to the choice of our conventions but can be simply reabsorbed into a redefinition of the entropy S0.

in [18]. It considers both an expanding and a contracting branch, and it is nonperturbative in the parameter t: we expect, in particular, an interpretation of the oscillating terms as coming from some interference effects.
More generally, the appearance of nonperturbative contributions in the disk partition functions seems to suggest the presence of some kind of tunneling process. At t = 0, the boundary of the AdS2 patch extends to asymptotic infinity, which corresponds to having an infinite potential wall. However, as we move the boundary towards the interior of AdS2 by increasing t, the potential barrier turns out to be not infinite anymore, and a hard wall replaces it through Dirichlet conditions. Equivalently, according to the holographic RG picture presented in [4], one would expect that integrating out the geometry between the asymptotic boundary and a finite radial distance would result in the T T¯ deformation of the original Schwarzian. It is not unreasonable that the effective dynamics could support nontrivial tunneling amplitudes among different vacua in both cases.

9 Conclusions and outlook
This paper studied JT gravity as a model for holography at finite volume, considering the nonperturbative contributions coming from the cutoff scale. We assumed the conjectured holographic duality between a T T¯-deformed theory and gravity in a finite patch of AdS space. In the case of JT gravity, this amounts to consider the Schwarzian theory deformed by a one-dimensional analog of the T T¯ deformation. The same approach has been advocated in [18] where, among other things, crucial nonperturbative aspects arising from the radial cutoff have been explored. We investigated the appearance of exponentiallysuppressed terms in the disk and trumpet partition functions through Borel resummation and resurgence, finding a nice relation between these terms and the analytic structure of the

­ 26 ­

perturbative series in the deformation parameter. We then applied our findings to compute results for arbitrary topologies, exploiting the gluing procedure of [20]. The construction results in a consistent deformation of the Eynard­Orantin topological recursion relations, although we have not attempted to give a physical interpretation to the deformed spectral density.
There are a certain number of open questions arising from our studies that could stimulate further investigations. In our opinion, a crucial one concerns the physical realization of the deformed holographic dual. As already stressed, the deformed spectral density associated with the topological recursion is not positive definite, and it certainly cannot originate from an ordinary (double-scaled) matrix model. It would be interesting to explore the resolution of this problem in a wider perspective: for example, na¨ive non-positive-definite spectral densities show up in super-matrix models. Actually, in the context of JT gravity, one could consider the supersymmetric version of the bulk theory [32, 33]. In this case, the holographic dual is a supersymmetric Schwarzian quantum mechanics: its disk partition function provides nevertheless a positive spectral density that allows considering a higher-genus completion, whose interpretation is given in terms of different matrix ensembles [21, 34]. The T T¯ deformation (or some kind of) could arise from a radial cutoff in the bulk theory even for the supersymmetric JT gravity: we expect that exploring this direction would undoubtedly improve the understanding of the present construction and maybe provide a link with the matrix model approach proposed in [35]. A somewhat similar positivity problem appears in the context of JT gravity with defects [36] and was solved by an appropriate sum over quantum configurations, leading to a nontrivial modification of the theory [37].
Another research direction worth to be taken into account concerns a full first-principles derivation of the path integral for the bulk theory at finite cutoff. Besides providing a solid foundation for the gluing procedure used in Section 5, this would unambiguously fix the integration measure, which in [18] is assumed to be unaltered by the deformation. Such a choice is in sharp contrast with the approach of [19], where instead, a significant role was played by a particular class of paths in the nonperturbative regime, leading to very different results. In order to gain a better understanding of this discrepancy, one would perform a bulk path-integral calculation, taking properly into account configurations with nonconstant Schwarzian action [38]: in principle, a semiclassical calculation could elucidate the contribution of such configurations to the path-integral measure and indicate other nonperturbative effects.
It would also be interesting to understand the behavior of the bulk theory at finite cutoff in the presence of matter: for example, the existence of a U(1) chiral current could provide a deformation of the Schwarzian quantum mechanics analogous to the JT¯ deformation in two-dimensional CFTs [39]. In [40], such a deformation has been proposed leading, for some choice of the parameters, to a positive-definite spectral density.
As a final remark, we observe that the spectral form factor in the T T¯-deformed theory shows some differences with respect to the original JT case, although certain universal aspects remain present. In particular, the appearance of an oscillating term in the ramp regime hints towards a different interpretation of the holographic picture.

A Perturbative expansion from Bell polynomials

In this appendix, we show how to obtain the coefficients An defined in (3.4). These determine the t-expansion of the disk and the trumpet partition functions. As in Section 3.1, we begin by decomposing the exponential term as

When continuing this result to negative values of , one should be careful about the fact that the Gauss hypergeometric function has a branch cut on the positive real axis.

an integral over a Hankel-like contour wrapping the branch cut, as depicted in Figure 9, which, in turn, amounts to taking the Laplace transform of the discontinuity of the hypergeometric function. We use the identity
