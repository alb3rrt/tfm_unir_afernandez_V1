Two-component coupled Bose gas in a 1D optical lattice is examined. In addition to the postulated Mott insulator and Superfluid phases, multiple bosonic components manifest spin degrees of freedom. Coupling of the components in the Bose gas within same site and neighboring sites leads to substantial change in the previously observed spin phases revealing fascinating remarkable spin correlations. In the presence of strong interactions it gives rise to unconventional effective ordering of the spins leading to unprecedented spin phases: site-dependent z-x spin configuration with tunable (by hopping parameter) proclivity of spin alignment along z. Exact analysis and Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) along with stochastic minimization on Entangled Plaquette State (EPS) bestow a unique and enhanced perspective into the system beyond the scope of mean-field treatment. The physics of complex intra-component tunneling and inter-component coupling and filling factor greater than unity are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION
Ultracold gases provide an unparalleled platform to explore physics found in atomic or molecular gases, offering a manifold of prospects to simulate and examine canonical models of strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter systems [1, 2], owing to them being clean, versatile, and highly controllable. Observation of superfluid to Mott insulator transition [3] and theoretical and experimental demonstration of exotic quantum phase transitions [4] in cold atomic setups have paved the way towards studying many-body physics [1, 2, 5­ 7], in association with strong correlations [3, 8], and relating to the emergence of collective and thermodynamic behavior [5, 9]. Experimental demonstrations--of cold atoms in lattices via weak trapping potential superimposed onto optical lattices [6], achievement of low temperature relevant for spin orders [1, 10­12] necessary for superexchange couplings resulting in effective nearest-neighbor spin­spin interaction demonstrated in array of double wells [13] via a combination of evaporative and adiabatic cooling [14­21], and simulating magnetic fields via artificial gauge potential [22, 23]--provide immense relevance to this field. Quantum magnetism, a most fascinating area of research in condensed matter physics, can be reproduced using cold atoms with tunable geometry and parameters; for instance, experimental study of itinerant magnetism in ultracold Fermi systems with repulsive interactions [24], classical magnetism in triangular lattices [25] with fast oscillations of optical lattice enabling tuning the sign of nearest-neighbor tunneling [26], bosons with strong interactions in a tilted lattice at commensurate fillings for study of Ising model and quantum phase transition [27, 28] and possible realization of quantum dimer models [27, 29].

correlated many-body quantum systems [5, 30, 31] and simulate lattice spin models [1, 2, 31­39] such as quadraticbiquadratic spin model [40], or antiferromagnetic spin chains [27] and spin-1 model exhibiting Haldane (gapped) insulator phase [41­45]. Interesting extensions of Bose­Hubbard model, such as inclusion of next-to-nearest-neighbor tunneling or long range interactions [46­50], spinor bosons with multiple internal degrees of freedom [51, 52] and addition of non-linear coupling between the components [53­58], display fascinating remarkable phase diagram [47, 55­58]. A twocomponent Bose­Hubbard in Mott phase reveals pseudospins effectively coupled by Heisenberg exchange [38] imitating spin-1/2 Hamiltonian ideal for study of quantum magnetism [38, 59, 60], displays a spin-Mott phase in spin-1 Hamiltonian [11, 38, 39, 59, 61, 62], and in the presence of strong repulsions presents finite-temperature phase structure with possibility of checkerboard long range order, supercounterflow, superfluidity, and phase separation [63]. Realization of controllable Bose­Bose mixtures [64] makes way for the experimental reproduction of spin Hamiltonians, with detection and study of magnetic phases such as antiferromagnetic Néel and xy ferromagnetic phases.
The physics of coherent coupling in ultracold gases is consequential for quantum information processing and simulation [31, 37]; supported by the demonstration of strong coupling between Bosonic Mott insulators and light [65, 66] and the recent work in cold atoms proposing the realization and manipulation of new quantum states [67­74] and high precision quantum limited measurements [75]. In the twocomponent Bose gas, introducing coupling reveals fascinating physics; for instance, the phase separation in weak interaction limit [76] changing dramatically [77­88], modifying the Mott-insulator­superfluid transition [89], and altering entanglement properties [90]. With the introduction of non-linear coupling in many-body systems, stable collective modes appear, thus paving the way for robust control [91, 92], with their localization properties and robustness against perturbations demonstrated in a tilted Bose­Hubbard model [93].
Here, we study Bose gas with two components trapped in 1D optical lattice forming a two component Bose­Hubbard Model. Presence of multiple bosonic components manifests spin degrees of freedom in addition to Mott insulator and

superfluid phases [38, 59]. The coupling of the two components on the nearest-neighboring sites with strong on-site interactions presents unconventional effective ordering generating unprecedented spin behavior. The formation of a new site-dependent z-x configuration occurs owing to this coupling. The choice of spin alignment along z can be tuned using hopping parameters. This unique phase preferentially places a component on one site and a superposition in its nearestneighbors. Multiple perspectives--mean-field approximation, exact analysis, and entangled-plaquette states (EPS)-- enhance the understanding of the system; capturing correlations beyond the scope of a mean-field treatment. The physics of filling factor greater than unity where the unconventional spin correlations persist, and the consideration of complex intra-component tunneling and inter-component coupling are discussed.
This paper is sectioned as follows: II describes the coupled two-component Bose­Hubbard model, III details the mapped spin-1/2 model, IV is the multi-perspective study of the spin phases, V extends to discuss complex intra-component tunneling and inter-component coupling as well as the physics of occupancy greater than unity, and VI summarizes the results and discusses their implications and future avenues.
II. THE MODEL
We consider a 1D system comprising two kinds of bosons trapped in an optical lattice as shown in Fig. 1. The two components termed as a and b, can be envisioned as two internal levels of an atom. We assume low temperature and the optical lattice to be deep enough for the atoms to be confined to the lowest Bloch band describing a two-component Bose­ Hubbard model [39, 94]. The optical lattice is tilted, creating an energy offset between the neighboring sites as shown in Fig. 1, with the assumption that the potential applied to create this tilt is a perturbation. This tilt can be introduced using a

magnetic or a static electric field gradient [95, 96]. The tilting of the lattice prevents the natural hopping between components a (or b) and is obtained via light assisted tunneling: resonant two-photon Raman transition [95].
We introduce to this system inter-component coupling; this can be obtained by applying a microwave field nearly resonant to the transition frequency of the two internal states as can be seen in Fig. 1 (inset).
The resulting system is governed by the following Hamiltonian:

where ai and bi are the bosonic annihilation operators for components a and b at site i, respectively. tk is the componentdependent tunneling parameter and U is the intra-component
on-site interaction. The inter-component on-site interaction
is given as Uab, which can be tuned via Feshbach resonance. Two kinds of inter-component couplings are present: J1 and J2 representing the same-site and nearest-neighbor coupling, respectively. The energy offset between nearest-neighboring sites of the optical lattice (Fig. 1) differentiates the couplings, where J2 defines the inter-component coupling between b at site i and a at site i+1. The presence of this offset also allows independent tuning of J1 and J2 (Fig. 1 inset). The two component Bose­Hubbard shows spin degrees of free-
dom that arise from the bosonic components in addition to the
known Mott insulator and superfluid phases. In the deep Mott limit (U, Uab tk, J1, J2), with the average number of particles per site being fixed due to the high energy cost of bosons
hopping from one site to another, this can be mapped to a spin
system. In the following sections we study the system in the
deep Mott limit, specifically for the case of one particle per site that is mapped to spin-1/2, where a:  and b: .

Inset: To the system is introduced microwave-field-assisted intercomponent coupling: J1 (same-site) and J2 (nearest-neighbor). The two components are visualized as two levels of an atom.

III. EFFECTIVE SPIN HAMILTONIAN
Strong on-site interactions divide the Hilbert space into low-energy and high-energy subspaces, which are coupled by the coupling and tunneling coefficients as shown in Fig. 2. A particle hopping from one site to another increases the occupancy, thus going from a low-energy to high-energy subspace, and thus incurring high energy cost in the process. Whereas two particles exchanging positions preserve the occupancy, hence not requiring as high an energy cost. To study the relevant physics, the effective low-energy subspace is obtained by decoupling the existing subspaces; in this process removing any first order hopping that increases the occupancy and retaining the second order virtual hopping terms that preserves the occupancy.
The two-component Bose­Hubbard model mapped to an effective spin (low-energy) Hamiltonian via canonical trans-

where J = / , tatb Uab Jz = - / + / (ta2 +tb2 -J22) U (ta2 +tb2 -J22) 2Uab provides the xy and z ordering respectively. The xy ordering is always
ferromagnetic in nature, while the z ordering can be tuned
from ferromagnetic to anti-ferromagnetic by varying the parameters ta, tb, and J2. The terms hz = / - / 2ta2 U 2tb2 U and hx = J2(ta +tb)(1/Uab +1/U), J1 act as fictitious magnetic fields along z and x, transforming the system to a spin-polarized state. Unconventional ordering terms, Jzx = / J2tb U and Jxz = / J2ta U arise due to the directional nearest-neighbor inter-component cou-
pling. They align the spins along x on one site and z in the
neighboring sites or vice versa providing a simple way to im-
plement site-dependent spin alignment. We choose to con-
sider only J2 in our work as J1, with no energy cost in samesite coupling, trivially leads the system to an x ferromagnetic
phase. The correlations uniquely seen in the presence of J2 is expected to result in the states |a+b i-1|a i or |b i|a+b i+1 at suitable strengths of ta, tb, and J2. Previous work studying the two-component Bose­Hubbard model in the absence
of inter-component coupling, shows xy ferromagnetic (FM; ta  tb), z anti-ferromagnetic (AFM; tab tba, U Uab)

[39] and z FM (tab tba, U  Uab) spin phases. With the introduction of inter-component coupling, we see new ordering terms hx, Jxz, and Jzx, significance of which is understood by studying the system behavior dictated by parameters ta, tb, and J2. In the study, on-site intra- and inter-component interactions are considered to be comparable (U  Uab), where the intra-component interaction is allowed to fluctuate between ±Uab/2. This limit is preferred as the unconventional correlations Jxz and Jzx are inversely proportional to U, and would have a small contribution in the other limit (U Uab).
Two sites (N = 2): The aim here is to investigate the spin phases that may emerge due to the unconventional correlations and identify the parameter phase regions where they materialize by examining a simplified two-site system. The two-site picture provides a facile description allowing for an exhaustive examination of the ground state forming the spin phases and the causative second order processes involved in the deep Mott limit. Additionally, such a straightforward illustration permits the pursuit of exact diagonalization for studying the effective spin Hamiltonian and validating the effective spin system, by comparing the ground states of the original and the mapped two-component Bose­Hubbard Hamiltonian. The basis states for two sites, each hosting either component a or b, are |a 1|a 2, |a 1|b 2, |b 1|a 2 and |b 1|b 2. The coupling and tunneling couples these states to high-energy states |aa 1|0 2, |0 1|aa 2, |ab 1|0 2, |0 1|ab 2, |bb 1|0 2, and |0 1|bb 2 as shown in Fig. 2(a). The combination of these different couplings result in hopping between low-energy states via an in-

termediary high-energy state resulting in virtual hoppings that form the effective Hamiltonian. Each of these virtual hoppings costs an energy that depends on the energy of the intermediate high-energy state. For instance, consider hopping between |b 1|a 2 and |b 1|b 2 that can occur either via the intermediate state |0 1|ab 2 with couplings J2 and tb and energy cost Uab forming an effective second order coupling coefficient / J2tb Uab or via |bb 1|0 2 with coupling coefficient / . J2tb U Let us focus on the processes that result in the unconventional correlations. Second order hopping occurs between |a 1|a 2 and |b 1|a 2 via state |0 1|aa 2 (J2 /ta U) or between |b 1|b 2 and |b 1|a 2 via state |bb 1|0 2 (J2 /tb U). Therefore, ta or tb tunneling should be significant when compared to J2 for these phases or correlations to be observable. The effective spin Hamiltonian is compared to the original Hamiltonian studied via exact diagonalization with open boundary conditions in Appendix B. In Fig. 3, the ground state of the mapped effective spin system is presented as a function of coupling (J2) and tunneling (ta). The probability of the basis states reveals the composition of the ground state and its variation with the tunneling and coupling coefficients, also providing one-to-one comparison with the original Hamiltonian, where the spin analogy cannot be applied. From Fig. 2(a), with only significant ta, all the four basis states can undergo a second order hopping to and from the same state; although state |a 1|a 2 is allowed multiple ways of hopping (via |aa 1|0 2 or |0 1|aa 2) and is the preferred state with its probability approaching unity as in Fig. 3 at ta J2. Similarly,

for significant tb the state |b 1|b 2 (via |bb 1|0 2 or |0 1|bb 2) or for significant J2 the state |b 1|a 2 (via |bb 1|0 2 or |0 1|aa 2) has highest delocalization as illustrated in Fig. 3. The inter-
esting states appear in the limit when one of the tunnelings is significant when compared to coupling (J2  tba tab). When tb  J2 ta, the ground state (having maximum paths of hopping) is a superposition of the higher probability states |b 1|b 2 and |b 1|a 2, whereas when ta  J2 tb, the ground state is a superposition of |a 1|a 2 and |b 1|a 2 as seen in Fig. 3. Studying the probability of basis states forming the
ground state of the original two-component Bose­Hubbard
model (Appendix B), we confirm that the mapped system is
an appropriate representation for the parameter strengths con-
sidered. More importantly, the states arising due to the un-
conventional correlations are not an artifact of the mapping
as they also appear in the original Hamiltonian ground state. We explain the ground state by studying the effective Hamiltonian. The preference for |a 1|a 2 or |b 1|b 2 appears due to Jz, hz  tab ordering, whereas the preference for the superposition of states |a 1|a 2 and |b 1|a 2 or |b 1|b 2 and |b 1|a 2 emerges due to Jzx or Jxz. A schematic of the spin phases is surmised from the ground state composition as shown in
Fig. 4. Introducing J2, the system with tab tba demonstrating a biased z FM phase shifts to a new site-dependent
phase with one site along z and the other along x arising due
to Jxz and Jzx. The orientation along z depends on ta and tb. This eventually shifts to a z AFM due to Jz. A system around ta  tb initially having an xy FM spin phase becomes an x FM due to hx, finally shifting to a z AFM phase. The presence of spin phases corresponding to the unconventional correla-
tions in both the mapped and the original Hamiltonians act as
a motivation to pursue many-body physics. In a large system,
overlapping correlations could potentially lead to an intricate
phase space leading to rich new physics.

IV. SPIN PHASES

In this section, we study the spin phases that arise in our system by evaluating the spin order parameters and correlations. The presence of the new phases emerging due to the unconventional correlations are further confirmed with the examination of the population of components a and b at each site. The study is performed using three different methods: (a) mean-field approximation, (b) exact analysis for small system size (N < 14), and (c) Variational Monte Carlo with stochastic minimization (VMC-SM) on Entangled-Plaquette States (EPS) for large system size (N > 15).
Mean-field approximation is the simplest approach pursued where each site is treated independent of the others, making it computationally efficient. Additionally, it is unaffected by system size or boundary condition. To illustrate the spin phases within mean-field, we designate every alternate site to subspace A and its neighboring sites to B. The following variational ansatz is considered:

| = (cos(A)|a i +sin(A)|b i)

Within mean-field approximation, the spin order along x and z computed using Pauli matrices:

ixi+1 = sin 2AB, zii+1 = cos 2AB;

(4)

the expectation of z and x spin correlations on sites i, i+1:

zi zi+1 = cos 2A cos 2B, ixix+1 = sin 2A sin 2B; (5) and unconventional spin correlations on sites i, i+1:

zi ix+1 = cos 2A sin 2B, ixzi+1 = sin 2A cos 2B (6)
The simplicity of mean-field approximation, in treating each site independent of others, may not accurately reflect the system behavior due to the presence of spin exchanges in the effective spin Hamiltonian correlating neighboring sites. This could dilute the effect of the unconventional correlations by being beyond the scope of the mean-field treatment.
Exact analysis provides the most accurate description of the system. Being devoid of any approximations, it is the most successful in capturing the effect of the unconventional correlations. Additionally it provides direct comparisons to N = 2, where the effective spin Hamiltonian is validated. Although the exact analysis does provide a better insight into the system, owing to its large computational expense, this is limited to smaller system sizes N < 14, where the effect of small system size and boundary can be observed. For the thermodynamic limit, this demands a numerical method that captures correlations better than mean-field but with lesser computation cost than exact analysis.
Entangled-Plaquette States (EPS) form a class of tensor network states, where the lattice is divided into plaquettes, and the wavefunction of the system is given by the product of

the plaquette wave functions which are scalar in nature[97]. This goes beyond the mean-field, by considering overlapping or entangled-plaquettes, and is more computationally efficient than exact analysis as the number of steps to obtain the system ground state undergo a low order polynomial increase with system size. It allows for large system sizes while retaining most of the effects of the correlations. The state for the system is a sum over all possible spin configurations (n) with each configuration weighted by amplitude W(n) [98]:

Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) along with stochastic minimization (SM) is used to obtain the optimized plaquette wave functions that minimize the energy and best describe the ground state [97]. The fluctuations in order parameters and correlations, a downside of the Monte Carlo approach are small and do not affect the behavior of the spin orders and correlations. Additionally, it demonstrates oscillations to represent the system hopping between degenerate ground states.
Employing all three methods in our analysis helps in validating each method and identifying areas where they fail. It also helps acquire an accurate interpretation of the results that best reflect the system behavior, with minimal effect of system size and mean-field approximation.
Results: The spin phases are studied at strong on-site intraand inter-component interaction (U  Uab) in Figs. 5, 6, and 7. In a strong coupling limit (J2 ta, tb; J2 U, Uab), zAFM spin phase emerges due to the strong effective ordering along z: Jz as seen in Figs. 5(a) and 7(i). With no significant intraparticle tunneling, only component b at some site j is allowed to tunnel to a at site j+1, and vice versa, resulting in highest delocalization of configuration |a j|b j+1 or |b j|a j+1, allowing the formation of the observed z AFM phase. The z AFM illustrated for exact analysis in Figs. 5(a iii) and 5(a iv) is biased with a preference for component b (or spin down z) on odd-numbered sites and component a (or spin up z) on evennumbered sites. The bias emerges due to the correlation Jxz or Jzx, and is observable due to a finite system size.
Allowing one component to tunnel by a small increase in intra-component tunneling tab (J2 > tab > tba), remarkable site and intra-component tunneling dependent spin phase materializes as depicted in Fig. 5. The phase demonstrates a strong z order at one site and strong x order at the neighboring sites. Spin orientation along z depends on the intracomponent tunneling, with up spin at ta > tb as seen in Fig. 5 and down spin at tb > ta. The presence of only one significant intra-component tunneling (tab > tba) allows for only

The orders evaluated via (i&ii) mean field approximation and (iii&iv) exact diagonalization for N = 8 are shown as a function of tunneling (ta) and coupling (J2), in the deep Mott regime (U = 1.2Uab) and in the absence of tunneling tb.

its tunneling. Along with strong coupling, which allows for the tunneling between b at a site j to a at j+1, and vice versa, causes high delocalization for configuration |a i|a+b/2 i+1 or |a+b/2 i|a i+1 at ta > tb and |b i|a+b/2 i+1 or |a+b/2 i|b i+1 at tb > ta. The new z-x and x-z spin phases obtained via exact diagonalization in Fig. 5(a iii&iv and b iii&iv) are biased similar to the z AFM, preferring xi-1 i xi+1 at tb > ta and i-1 xi i+1 at ta > tb. The unprecedented spin correlations and site configurations are further examined in Fig. 6 as a function of coupling J2. The strong coupling (J2  0.4Uab) creates a superposition of both components on one site whereas prefers component a on the neighboring sites at ta > tb, resulting in the formation of |a i|a+b/2 i+1 or |a+b/2 i|a i+1 as shown in Fig. 6(i). The spin correlations show a strong x-z(z-x) with z-x(x-z) approaching zero as shown in Fig. 6(ii). Similarly at tb > ta, component b is preferred on one site and a superposition on
the neighboring sites, resulting in unconventional correlation
z-x(x-z) obtaining a strong negative correlation while x-z(z-x)
approaches zero. The spin phases observed in the tunnelingcoupling regime are i xi+1 or xi i+1 at ta > tb and i xi+1 or xi i+1 at tb > ta. In exact analysis for system size N = 8, aside from the previously observed bias, higher probability of component a on site i+1 and nearly equal presence of both components on site i at ta > tb, and higher probability of component b on site i and nearly equal presence of both components on site i+1 at tb > ta exists over the (larger than mean-field) coupling range as illustrated in Fig. 6(b i). Confirmed by observing the
z-x and x-z spin correlations in Fig. 6(b ii), the xi-1zi xi+1 and zi-1 xizi+1 phases deviate at a weaker coupling resulting in a net xi-1 i xi+1 phase at ta > tb and i-1 xi i+1 phase at tb > ta over the (larger than mean-field) coupling range. This makes
the unconventional spin correlations more significant in exact

analysis when compared to mean-field, due to the inability of
the mean-field ansatz in capturing the site correlations. We
note, even though xi-1zi and zi xi+1 or zi-1 xi and xizi+1 represent the same spin phases, the small deviation in correlations, as seen in Fig. 6(b ii), are due to the effect of boundary condition with this deviation decreasing with increasing N. The
site configuration and unconventional correlations for system size N = 20 obtained via VMC-SM on EPS in Fig. 6(c) represents a behavior that comprises the trend seen in both the
exact analysis and the mean-field approximation. The new phases obtained here are degenerate, forming xi i+1 or i xi+1 at ta > tb and xi i+1 or i xi+1 at tb > ta, which is similar to the mean-field results. The z-x and x-z persist over a long
range of coupling as in exact analysis, resulting in stronger
x-z and z-x phases, indicating the ability of this method to
capture correlations beyond a mean-field treatment. We also
note that the correlations xi-1zi and zi xi+1 or zi-1 xi and xizi+1 representing same spin phase are identical and unaffected by the boundary condition, unlike in our exact analysis. The co-
existence of x-z and z-x at weak and extremely strong coupling in Fig. 6(ii), arising due to simultaneous non-vanishing of z and x on nearest-neighboring sites, is confirmed by the observation of z and x correlations in Fig. 7(b). The observed
unconventional phases emerge due to correlations Jxz and Jzx, and is preferentially chosen by the effective ordering hx and hz.
When one component's intra-component tunneling is as strong as the coupling (J2  tab tba), simultaneous nonvanishing of z and x exists on nearest-neighboring sites, owing to the strong Jz, hz, and hx ordering. When a component is allowed to tunnel, preference of that component on all sites
is expected; this leads to the spin up zFM for ta tb and spin

down zFM for tb ta as seen in Figs. 5(a) and 7(b). However, this preference changes with strong coupling as seen in Fig. 5, and 7(b).
Presence of both ta and tb results in an xy FM [99]; addition of strong coupling (J2  ta  tb) creates a strong xFM phase due to hx ordering, shown in Fig. 7(a). With both components being allowed to hop, all sites have equal presence of components a and b. The spin correlations obtained via VMC-SM on EPS are comparable to the mean-field treatment for correlations along z and x. However, VMC-SM on EPS is able to capture the xy phase, which is beyond the scope of the meanfield (see Fig. 7). The presence of an xy FM phase, lowers the x correlation in this numerical method. Additionally, we observe a non-zero z correlation as a consequence of the xy phase: in a pure x FM phase there is no z correlation, whereas in a pure xy FM phase, z correlation on neighboring sites yield -1.
Fig. 8, 9 and 10 present the spin orders, unconventional spin correlations x-z and z-x, and spin correlations along z, x and xy, respectively, as a function of intra-component tunneling ta or tb and for strong coupling J2. This comparison of the behavior for the three numerical methods, viz. exact analysis (N = 8), VMC-SM on EPS (N = 20), and mean-field approximation, presented here is to demonstrate their similarities, which validates our analysis.

V. EXTENSION
In this section we discuss the effect of complex tunneling and coupling coefficients on the spin phases, and extend our study to comment on the effective spin system at occupancy greater than unity.
Complex coefficients: Complex phases are associated with the nearest-neighboring intra-component tunnelings ta and tb and the inter-component coupling J2 resulting in new hopping parameters: ta = |ta|eia , tb = |tb|eib and J2 = |J2|eiJ . The Hamiltonian for the resulting system:

The ferromagnetic ordering (Jp) of neighboring sites along x splits to x- x and x-y ordering and that along y splits to y- x and y-y ordering. This splitting is dependent on the phase difference of coefficients ta and tb. However, the ordering Jz (along z) remains unchanged. The fictitious magnetic field (hx) along x splits to x and y; this splitting is dependent on the phase difference between tunneling (ta or tb) and coupling (J2). The fictitious magnetic field (hz) along z remains unchanged. A similar effect on the unconventional correlations with x-z(z-x) ordering on neighboring sites splitting to x-z and

9

y-z(z-x and z-y) dependent on the phase difference of ta or tb and J2. The complex hopping parameters result in an accumulation of phase with each hop. In the case when a component
hops to the neighboring site and back, there is no net phase
accumulated, which results in the z ordering terms remaining unaffected. In any other hopping, a net phase is obtained, which is proportional to the difference of the complex phases associated with tunneling and coupling. Since this is a onedimensional system, there is only a trivial effect of these complex coefficients; interesting outcomes are expected at higher dimensions.

provides anti-ferromagnetic or ferromagnetic ordering along

z (dependent on the tunneling and coupling parameters ta, tb, and J2). Jxz = / 4J2ta Uab and Jzx = / 4J2tb Uab provide the unconven-

As expected, despite increasing the occupancy, the unconven-

tional ordering persists. In spin-1, an additional competing

parameter µ appears with an additional spin Mott phase.

VI. SUMMARY
In conclusion, coupling of the two components in the nearest-neighboring sites via a microwave field gives rise to a unique site-dependent z-x spin configuration, where the spin alignment along z is tuned using the intra-component tunneling coefficients. This spin configuration presents as one of the components (a or b) on one site, and a superposition of them in the nearest-neighboring sites. Our analysis demonstrates that coupling of the components in the nearest neighboring sites provides an additional parameter to tune between the previously seen z AFM, z FM and x FM spin phases in a spin independent optical lattice.
We employ exact analysis for small system size (N = 8) and Variational Monte Carlo along with stochastic minimization on Entangled-Plaquette State for large system size (N = 20). These confirm the presence of strong unconventional correlations beyond the mean-field approximation. Introduction of complex intra-component tunneling and inter-component coupling alters the ordering along x. The unconventional correlations split to have x and y order on a site and z on nearestneighboring sites. For filling factor greater than unity, the unconventional correlations persist.
Future Avenues: Our work provides new insights into the Bose­Hubbard model and offers an easily tunable phase parameter. The effect of the coupling can be extended to the analyze the topological order in this system. Additionally, the effect of the unconventional correlations for a generalized M occupancy at even and odd fillings using the mapped spin-M/2 Hamiltonian can be studied. Our assessment of the mapped system with complex hopping coefficients is extensible to higher dimensions. Finally, unexpected spin behaviors may emerge when considering Rydberg atoms on account of their long-range interactions.

Appendix A: Effective Hamiltonian: Canonical Transformation
Define two complementary subspaces: HP (low-energy) with projector P and HQ (high-energy) with projector Q(= 1-P). The effective Hamiltonian can be expressed as [100]:

Heff

QHP

(A1)

The zeroth order has no contribution as the hopping terms in
the Hamiltonian lead to higher occupancy and are thus pro-
jected out. The interaction terms yield 0 for unit occupancy. In PHQ or QHP the only contribution is from hopping terms (ta, tb, J2) in the Hamiltonian that can couple the two subspaces. Whereas, in QHQ, only the interaction terms (U, Uab) contribute as they do not change the subspace.

There are nine second order or virtual hopping processes that contribute to and form the effective Hamiltonian. The first and second are processes describing two particles of the same
component exchanging positions. The eighth and ninth are processes when component b (or a) hops from (i+1)(i-1) to i and component a (or b) hops from i to (i+1)(i-1). These four processes have been studied previously [99] and
result in the formation of z FM and xy FM phases. With
the introduction of J2, five additional processes arise. The third process describes component a at i+1 and b at i exchange positions. The fourth and sixth together represent (ab)i, ai+1  bi, (ab)i+1. Similarly, the fifth and seventh together describe bi, (ab)i+1  (ab)i, ai+1. The processes are derived and expressed as follows:

Consider two sites each hosting component ab, form-
ing the basis states |a 1|a 2,|a 1|b 2,|b 1|a 2 and |b 1|b 2 with the analysis restricted to the limit U  Uab. The coupling and the tunneling couples these basis states to high-energy

The effective spin Hamiltonian is validated by comparing the behavior of the ground state of the original Hamilto-
nian to the mapped Hamiltonian. The ground state of the
two-component Bose­Hubbard model is studied using basis states |a 1|a 2, |a 1|b 2, |b 1|a 2, |b 1|b 2, |aa 1|0 2, |0 1|aa 2, |ab 1|0 2, |0 1|ab 2, |bb 1|0 2 and |0 1|bb 2. This is chosen to ensure the preferred states have one particle per site, although
the coupling and the tunneling can couple these states to states
having two particles on one site and none on the neighbor-
ing site. On comparison, we note at higher values of tab or J2, the two show small deviation due to the failing of the Mott condition required for the effective picture, leading to a negligible but non-zero probability of higher energy states |aa 1|0 2, |0 1|aa 2, |ab 1|0 2, |0 1|ab 2, |bb 1|0 2, and |0 1|bb 2 in the ground state.
Compared to the original system, |b, a is not as pronounced, with some presence of |a, b . Additionally, the states |a, a and |b, b are more pronounced. Overall, the behavior
generally remains the same for both and the presence of un-
conventional correlations that cause the formation of superposition of |b, a and |b, b at tb ta or |b, a and |a, a at ta tb exists.
