## Abstract

Future power grids will be operating a large number of heterogeneous dynamical actors. Many ofthese will contribute to the fundamental dynamical stability of the system. By taking a complexitytheoretic perspective we derive a normal form for grid forming components in power grids. Thisallows analyzing the grids systemic properties without the need for detailed technical models.Our approach is based on the physics of the power flow in the grid on the one hand, and on thecommon symmetry that is inherited from the control objectives grid-forming power grid componentsare trying to achieve. We provide a first experimental validation that this normal form can capturethe behavior of complex grid forming inverters without any knowledge of the underlying technology,and show that it can be used to make technology independent statements on the stability of futuregrids.
