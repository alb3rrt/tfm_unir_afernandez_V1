WELL-POSEDNESS IN SOBOLEV SPACES OF THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL MHD BOUNDARY LAYER EQUATIONS WITHOUT VISCOSITY
Wei-Xi Li and Rui Xu

Abstract. We consider the two-dimensional MHD Boundary layer system without hydrodynamic viscosity, and establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions in Sobolev spaces under the assumption that the tangential component of magnetic fields dominates. This gives a complement to the previous works of Liu-Xie-Yang [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 72 (2019)] and Liu-Wang-Xie-Yang [J. Funct. Anal. 279 (2020)], where the well-posedness theory was established for the MHD boundary layer systems with both viscosity and resistivity and with viscosity only, respectively. We use the pseudo-differential calculation, to overcome a new difficulty arising from the treatment of boundary integrals due to the absence of the diffusion property for the velocity.

1. Introduction

In this work we study the existence and uniqueness of solution to the two-dimensional mag-
netohydrodynamic (MHD) boundary layer system without viscosity which reads, letting  := T × R+ = (x, y)  R2; x  T, y > 0 be the fluid domain,

tu + (ux + vy)u - (f x + gy)f + xp = 0,

Note the MHD boundary system with a nonzero hydrodynamic viscosity will reduce to the classical Prandtl equations in the absence of a magnetic field, and the main difficulty for investigating Prandtl equation lies in the nonlocal property coupled with the loss of one order tangential derivative when dealing with the terms vyu. The mathematical study on the Prandtl boundary layer has a long history, and there have been extensive works concerning its well/ill-posedness theories. So far the two-dimensional (2D) Prandtl equation is wellexplored in various function spaces, see, e.g., [1, 2, 4­10, 12, 14, 21­23] and the references therein. Compared with the Prandtl equation the treatment is more complicated since we have a new difficulty caused by the additional loss of tangential derivative in the magnetic field. So far the MHD boundary layer system is mainly explored in the two settings.

· Without any structural assumption on initial data the well-posedness for 2D and 3D MHD boundary systems was established in Gevrey space by the first author and T. Yang [13] with Gevrey index up to 3/2, and it remains interesting to relax the Gevrey index therein to 2 inspired the previous works of [4, 11] on the well-posedness for the Prandtl equations in Gevrey space with optimal index 2.
· Under the structural assumption that the tangential magnetic field dominates, i.e., f = 0, the well-posedness in weighted Sobolev space was established by Liu-Xie-Yang [17] and Liu-Wang-Xie-Yang [15] without Oleinik's monotonicity assumption, where the two cases that with both viscosity and resistivity and with only viscosity are considered, respectively. These works, together with the essential role of the Oleinik's monotonicity for well-posedness theory of the Prandtl equations (see, e.g., [1, 18, 19]), justify the stabilizing effect of the magnetic field on MHD boundary layer, no matter whether or not there is resistivity in the magnetic boundary layer equation

The aforementioned works [15, 17] investigated the well-posedness for MHD boundary layer system with the nonzero viscosity coefficient. This work aims to consider the case without viscosity coefficient, giving a complement to the previous works [15, 17]. To simply the argument we will assume without loss of generality that µ = 1 and (U, B)  0 in the system (1.1) since the result will hold true in the general case if we use some kind of the nontrivial weighted functions similar to those used in for the Prandtl equation. Hence we consider the following 2D MHD boundary layer system in the region  = T × R+

 t + ux + vy u - (f x + gy)f = 0,






  

t + ux + vy - y2

f

- (f x + gy)u = 0,

= f xv - gxu,

xu + yv = xf + yg = 0, 
(v, yf, g)|y=0 = (0, 0, 0), (u, f )|y+ = (0, 0),   (u, f )|t=0 = (u0, f0).

(1.3)

By the boundary condition and divergence-free condition above, we have

y

v(t, x, y) = - xu(t, x, y~)dy~, g(t, x, y) = - xf (t, x, y~)dy~.

We remark that the equation for g in (1.3) can be derived from the one for f and the main difficulty in analysis is the loss of x-derivatives in the two terms v and g. As to be seen in the

(1.4)

where u = (u, v), H = (f , g) denote velocity and magnetic field, respectively. The MHD system (1.4) is complemented with the boundary condition that

v|y=0 = 0, (yf , g)|y=0 = (0, 0).

It is an important issue in both mathematics and physics to ask the high Reynolds number

limit for MHD systems, and so far it is justified mathematically by Liu-Xie-Yang [16] with

the presence of viscosity and the other cases remain unclear.

Notation. Before stating the main result we first list some notation used frequently in

this paper. Given the domain  = T × R+, we will use · L2 and (·, ·)L2 to denote the norm

and inner product of L2 = L2() is specified. Similar notation will

and use be used

the notation · L2x for L. Moreover,

and (·, we use

L·)pxL(2xLwqy )h=enLthp (eTv;aLrqia(bRl+e

x ))

for the classical Sobolev space. Let Hm = Hm() be the standard Sobolev space and define

the weighted Sobolev space Hm by setting, for   R,

Hm = f (x, y) :   R;

f

2 Hm

:=

y +j xi yj f (x, y)

2 L2

<

+

,

i+jm

where here and below y = 1 + |y|2 1/2. With the above notation the well-posedness theory of (1.1) in weighted Sobolev space can be stated as below. Here the main assumption is that the tangential magnetic field in (1.1) dominates, that is, f = 0.

Theorem

1.1.

Let

and



>

+

be two given numbers.

Suppose the initial data

u0, f0 of (1.3) lie in H4() satisfying that there exists a constant c0 > 0 such that for any

(x, y)  ,

f0(x, y)  c0 y - and

yj f0(x, y)  c-0 1 y --j .

j2

(1.5)

Then the MHD boundary layer system (1.3) admits a unique local-in-time solution

u, f  L([0, T ]; H4)

for some T > 0. Moreover a constant c > 0 exists such that for any (t, x, y)  [0, T ] × ,

f (t, x, y)  c y - and

yj f (t, x, y)  c-1 y --j .

j2

Remark 1.2. The result above confirms that the magnetic field may act as a stabilizing factor on MHD boundary layer. The stabilizing effect was justified by [17] for the case with both viscosity and resistivity, and by [15] for the case without resistivity.

2. Derivation of the boundary layer system

This section is devoted to deriving the boundary layer system (1.1). We consider the MHD

system in 

tu + (u · )u - (H · )H + p = 0,  tH + (u · )H - (H · )u - µH = 0,
 · u =  · H = 0,  u|t=0 = u0, H|t=0 = b0,

(2.1)

where u = (u, v), H = (f , g) denote velocity and magnetic fields, respectively. The above system is complemented with the no-slip boundary condition on the normal component of velocity field and perfectly conducting boundary condition on the magnetic field, that is,

v|y=0 = (0), (yf , g)|y=0 = (0, 0).

(2.2)

A boundary layer will appear in order to overcome a mismatch on the boundary y = 0 for the tangential magnetic fields between (2.1) and the limiting equations by letting   0. To derive the governing equations for boundary layers we consider the ansatz

u(t,

x,

y)

=

u0(t,

x,

y)

+

ub(t,

x,

 O( ),

  v(t,

g(t, x, y) = g0(t, x, y) + gb(t, x, y~) + O(),

 
p(t,

x,

y)

=

p0(t,

x,

y)

+

pb(t,

x,

y~)

+

 O( ),

(2.3)

 where we used the notation y~ = y/ .

We suppose ub, f b, and pb in the expansion (2.3)

polynomially trend to zero as y~  +, that is, as   0. Similarly for the expansion of the

initial data.

Boundary conditions. Taking trace on y = 0 for the second and the fourth expansions in (2.3) and recalling the boundary condition (2.2), we derive that

v0|y=0 = g0|y=0 = 0,

(2.4)

and using again the second and the fourth equations in (2.3) and letting   0, we get that

vb|y=0 = gb|y=0 = 0.

(2.5)

Moreover observe

This gives

The governing equations of the fluid behavior near and far from the boundary. We substitute the ansatz (2.3) into (2.1) and consider the order of . At the order -1/2 we get
y~pb  0.
This with the assumption that pb goes to 0 as y~  + implies

pb  0.

(2.7)

At the order 0, letting y~  + (  0) and taking into account (2.4) and fact that ub, f b, and pb polynomially trend to zero as   0, we see the limiting system is the ideal
incompressible MHD system:

tu0 + (u0 · )u0 - (H0 · )H0 + p0 = 0,

(2.8)

complemented with the boundary condition (2.4) and initial data u0in and Hi0n, where u0 = (u0, v0), H0 = (f 0, g0).
Next we will derive the boundary layer equations. Let u0 = (u0, v0), H0 = (f 0, g0) be the solution to the ideal MHD system (2.8). By Taylor expansion we write u0(t, x, y) as

u0(t,

x,

y)

=

u0(t,

x,

+

y y u0 (t,

=

 y~y u0

where here and below we use the notation h to stand for the trace of a function h on the

boundary y = 0. Similarly,

v0(t,

x,

y)

=

 y~y

v0

O(),

g0(t,

 y~y

f

O(),

p0(t,

+

 y~y g0

O().

Now we compare the order 0 for the resulting equation by substituting the ansatz (2.3) as well as the above Taylor expansion of u0 = (u0, v0), H0 = (f 0, g0) into (2.1); this gives, by
virtue of (2.7) and (2.8) ,

t(u0 + ub) + (u0 + ub)x(u0 + ub) + (y~ · yv0 + vb) · y~ub





   

- (f 0 + f b)x(f 0 + f b) - (y~ · yg0 + gb) · y~f b + xp0 = 0,





t(f 0 + f b) + (u0 + ub)x(f 0 + f b) + (y~ · yv0 + vb) · y~f b

   


- (f 0 + f b)x(u0 + ub) - (y~ · yg0 + gb) · y~ub - µy2~f b = 0,

(2.9)

Denoting

u(t, x, y~) = u0 + ub(t, x, y~), v(t, x, y~) = y~yv0 + vb(t, x, y~),

f (t, x, y~) = f 0 + f b(t, x, y~), g(t, x, y~) = y~yg0 + gb(t, x, y~),

and recalling ub, f b polynomially trend to 0 as y~  +, we combine (2.9) and the boundary

conditions (2.4)­(2.6) to conclude that all equations except the third one in (1.1) are fulfilled

by u, v, f, and g. For simplicity of notation, we have replaced y~ by y. Note that the third

6

equation in (1.1) can be derived from the second one and the boundary condition yf |y=0 = 0 by observing that
y
g(t, x, y) = - xf (t, x, z)dz.
0
Finally we remark the Bernoulli's law (1.2) follows by taking trace on y = 0 for the ideal MHD system (2.8).

3. A priori energy estimates

The general strategy for constructing solutions to (1.3) involves mainly two ingredients. One is to construct appropriate approximate solutions, which reserve a similar properties as (1.5) for initial data by applying the standard maximum principle for parabolic equations in the domain  (see [18, Lemmas E.1 and E.2 ] for instance). Next we need to deduce the uniform estimate for these approximate solutions. For sake of simplicity we only present the following a priori estimate for regular solutions, which is a key part to prove the main result Theorem 1.1.

We will present the proof of Theorem 3.1 in the next two subsections, one of which is

devoted to the estimates on tangential and another to the normal derivatives. To simplify

the notation we will use the capital letter C in the following argument to denote some generic

constants that may vary from line to line, and moreover use C to denote some generic constants depending on a given number 0 <   1.

3.1. Energy estimates: tangential derivatives. In this part, we will derive the estimate on tangential derivatives, following the cancellation mechanism observed in the previous work of Liu-Xie-Yang [17].

Recall E is defined in (3.1).

x4f = -(yu)x4v + (yf )x4g + F4,

As a result, using the representation of  and  given in (3.3) and the fact that |(yf )/f | y -1 gives

It remains to deal with the boundary integeral on the right of (3.10). We first apply y to the second equation in (1.3) and then take trace on y = 0; this together with the boundary

condition in (1.3) gives

y3f |y=0 = 2(yu)xf |y=0 - f xyu|y=0.

(3.12)

By virtue of the above representation of y3f |y=0, we compute directly that

y5f |y=0 = y3 tf + uxf + vyf - f xu - gy u y=0

= uxy3f - f xy3u - 4(xu)y3f - 7(xyu)y2f + 4(xf )y3u

(3.13)

+ 8(yu)xy2f - u(xf )xyu + uf x2yu - 2u(yu)x2f + 2f (yu)x2u

.
y=0

As a result we combine (3.13) with Sobolev's inequality to conclude

- (y4f )y5f |y=0dx  f (y4f )(xy3u)|y=0dx + D + C E + E2 .

Substituting the above inequality and (3.11) into (3.10) and then integrating over [0, t] for

any t  [0, T ] we obtain the desired estimate (3.9).

Step 2). In this step we will treat the first term on the right of (3.9) and prove that

holds true for any  > 0. To do so we recall some facts on the Fourier multiplier. Let k  Z

be the partial Fourier dual variable of x  T and let x,   R, be the Fourier multiplier with symbol 1 + k2 /2, that is,

Fx(xf )(k) = (1 + k2)/2Fx(f )(k),

where Fx stands for the Fourier transform with respect to x variable:

(Fxf )(k) := f (x)e-ikxdx,
T
Similarly we define |Dx|,  > 0, by setting

k  Z.

Fx(|Dx| f )(k) = |k| Fx(f )(k).

Given a C1 function  of x  T with bounded derivatives, we have, for 0 <  < 1,

 w  L2x, [|Dx| , ]w L2x  C (  L + x L ) w L2x

(3.15)

with C a constant depending only on , recalling the commutator [|Dx| , ] is defined by

(3.7). Note the counterpart for x  R of (3.15) is clear, see, e.g., [3, Pages 702­704], the

estimate (3.15) can be proven in a similar inspirit and we omit it for brevity and and refer to

[20] and references therein for the comprehensive argument on the extension of the classical

pseudo-differential calculus in R to the torus case x  T.

With the Fourier multipliers introduced above we use (3.15) to compute

Observe the above inequality still holds true if we replace y +4 y4 by y +j xi yj with i + j  4 and use the boundary conditions (3.12) and yf |y=0 = 0. Since the argument is
straightforward we omit it for brevity. The proof of Lemma 3.3 is completed.
