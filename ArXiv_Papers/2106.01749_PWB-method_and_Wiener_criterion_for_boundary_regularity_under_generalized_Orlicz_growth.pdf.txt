Abstract: Perron's method and Wiener's criterion have entirely solved the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation. Since then, this approach has attracted the attention of many mathematicians for applying these ideas in the more general equations. So, in this paper, we extend the Perron method and the Wiener criterion to the G(·)-Laplace equation.

1 Introduction
In this paper, we are concerned with the regularity of boundary point of a bounded domain  of Rn respect to Dirichlet problem associated to G(·)-Laplace operator defined by:
-G(·)(u) := -divg(x|, |u|u|)u,
where g(·) is the density of a generalized Orlicz function G(·) that have been previously used in [3, 4, 5, 13, 14, 15]. This equation covers for example, the p-Laplace equation G(x, t) = tp, the variable exponent case G(x, t) = tp(x) and its perturbation G(x, t) = tp(x) log(e + t), the double phase case G(x, t) = tp + a(x)tq, and the Orlicz case G(x, t) = G(t). More examples can be found in [13].
Historically, Riemann proposed in 1851 the Dirichlet principle, which states that a harmonic function always exists in the interior of a domain with boundary conditions given by a continuous function. However, Lebesgue produced in 1912 an example of the bounded domain on which the Dirichlet problem was not always solvable. Overcome this problem; there is a method based on the work of Perron, Wiener, and Brelot is nowadays well known the Perron's method or PWB-method [25], also referred to the method of subharmonic functions, based on the finding the largest subharmonic function with boundary values below the desired values. The advantage of this method is that one can construct reasonable solutions for arbitrary boundary data. After that, in 1924, Wiener introduced the harmonic capacity to give his famous criterion of the regularity
1

of a boundary point which allows us to solve the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation completely. Since then, Perron's method and Wiener's criterion have attracted the attention of many mathematicians for applying these ideas to study the Dirichlet problem in the more general equations.

For f  W 1,G(·)(), the authors proved in [5] the existence of the solution to the Dirichlet-Sobolev

problem

-G(·)(u) = 0 in  u - f  W01,G(·)().

where W 1,G(·)() and W01,G(·)() are the generalized Orlicz-Sobolev space, also called Musielak-Orlicz-Sobolev space (see section 2). So, the question that arises is on the regularity of the Sobolev boundary point

x0  , i.e

lim
xx0

u(x)

=

f

(x0),

for any f  W 1,G(·)()  C().

In the p-Laplace equation, G(x, t) = tp, if  satisfies the exterior sphere condition (see section

3) then  is a Sobolev p-regular domain. By the work of Harjulehto and Hästö in the locally

fat set [14], we generalize this result in our situation. As a consequence of this result, we solve

the Dirichlet problem for simple domains. We shall need this possibility to construct the Poison

modification of our functions because this modification is based on the approximation of the

solution to the Dirichlet problem in balls. Therefore, by the ideas of Granlund, Lindqvist, and

Martio [12], we can apply Perron's method to the G(·)-Laplace equation. More correctly, the

regularity of boundary point is defined in connection with the solution of generalized Dirichlet

problem (see [17, 25]), not only for Dirichlet-Sobolev solution. Precisely, we say a boundary

point x0   is regular if

lim
xx0

Hf

(x)

=

f (x0),

for f  C() where Hf is the Perron solution with boundary data f (see section 5).

In the non-linear case, the best condition for the regularity boundary points is given by the celebrated

Wiener criterion. This criterion has been generalized in the variable constant. The sufficiency part

has been proved by Maz'ya in [22], and the necessary part was proved by Kilpelainen and Maly

in [18]. Next, Trudinger and Wang [26] gave a new method based on Poisson modification and

Harnack inequality. Mikkonen has treated the weighted situation in [23]. Björn has developed the

proof of this criterion in the metric measure spaces [7]. In the variable exponent case, G(x, t) =

tp(x), the problem has been study by Alkhutov and Krasheninnikova in [1]. Recently, K.A Lee and

S.C Lee in [20] proved the Wiener criterion for the regularity of Sobolev boundary point in the

Orlicz case. So, it is natural to ask what Wiener criterion should satisfy to guarantee regular points

in the generalized Orlicz situation. Applying estimates of a particular G(·)-supersolution called

the G(·)-potential, the central condition (A1,n) (see section 2), the pointwise Wolff estimates in [6], and the Perron G(·)-solution, we get our main result, which is new even in the Orlicz case.

Theorem 1.1. Let G(·)  (Rn)  C1(R+) be strictly convex and satisfy (SC), (A0), (A1), and (A1,n). The point x0   is G(·)-regular if and only if for some  > 0,

2 Preliminary

Definition 2.1. A function G :  × [0, )  [0, ] is called a generalized -function, denoted by G(·)  (), if the following conditions hold

· For each t  [0, ), the function G(·, t) is measurable.

· For a.e x  , the function G(x, ·) is an -function, i.e.

1. G(x, 0) = lim G(x, t) = 0 and lim G(x, t) = ;

t0+

t

2. G(x, ·) is increasing and convex.

Note that, a generalized -function can be represented as

t
G(x, t) = g(x, s) ds,
0
where g(x, ·) is the right-hand derivative of G(x, ·). Furthermore, for each x  , the function g(x, ·) is right-continuous and nondecreasing. So, we have the following inequality

g(x, a)b  g(x, a)a + g(x, b)b, for x   and a, b  0

(2.1)

We denote G+B(t) := supB G(x, t), G-B(t) := infB G(x, t). We say that G(·) satisfies (SC) : If there exist two constants g0, g0 > 1 such that,

1

<

g0



tg(x, t) G(x, t)



g0.

(A0) : If there exists a constant c0 > 1 such that,

1 c0

 G(x, 1)  c0,

a.e

x  .

(A1) : If there exists C > 0 such that, for every x, y  BR   with R  1, we have

GB(x, t)  CGB(y, t),

when G-B(t)

1 Rn

.

(A1,n) : If there exists C > 0 such that, for every x, y  BR   with R  1, we have

GB(x, t)  CGB(y, t),

when t  1, 1 . R

The following lemma gives a more flexible characterization of (A1,n) [13].

Lemma 2.1. Let   Rn be convex, G(·)  () and 0 < r  s. Then G(·) satisfies (A1,n) if, and only if, there exists C > 0 such that, for every x, y  BR   with R  1, we have

GB(x, t)  CGB(y, t)

when t 

r, s R

.

Under the structure condition (SC), we have the following inequalities

g0G(x, t)  G(x, t)  g0G(x, t), for x  , t  0 and   1.

(2.2)

g0G(x, t)  G(x, t)  g0G(x, t), for x  , t  0 and   1.

(2.3)

We define G(·) the conjugate -function of G(·), by

G(x, s) := sup(st - G(x, t)), for x   and s  0.
t0

Note that G(·) is also a generalized -function and can be represented as

t
G(x, t) = g-1(x, s) ds,
0
with g-1(x, s) := sup{t  0 : g(x, t)  s}. Furthermore, if G(·) satisfies (SC), then G(·) satisfies also (SC), as follows

g0 g0 -

1



tg-1(x, t) G(x, t)



g0 g0 -

1.

(2.4)

The functions G(·) and G(·) satisfies the following Young inequality

st  G(x, t) + G(x, s), for x   and s, t  0.

Further, we have the equality if s = g(x, t) or t = g-1(x, s). So, if G(·) satisfies (SC), we have the following inequality

G(x, g(x, t))  (g0 - 1)G(x, t), x  , t  0.

(2.5)

Definition 2.2. We define the generalized Orlicz space, also called Musielak-Orlicz space, by

LG(·)() := {u  L0()

:

lim
0

G(·)(|u|)

=

0},

where G(·)(t) = G(x, t) dx. If G(·) satisfies (SC), then

LG(·)() = {u  L0() : G(·)(|u|) < }.
Definition 2.3. We define the generalized Orlicz-Sobolev space by
W 1,G(·)() := {u  LG(·)() : |u|  LG(·)(), in the distribution sense},

equipped with the norm

u 1,G(·) = u G(·) + u G(·) .

Definition 2.4. W01,G(·)() is the closure of C0() in W 1,G(·)().

Note that, in such spaces, we have the following Poincaré inequality [13].

Theorem 2.1. Let G(·)  () satisfy (A0) and (A1). There exists a constant C > 0 such that



G(x,

|u| diam()

)

dx



C

G(x, |u|) dx + |{u = 0}  | ,


for every u  W01,G(·)().

Definition 2.5. Let G(·)  () and K   be a compact set. The relative G(·)-capacity of K with respect to  is

capG(·) (K ;

)

=

inf
uSG(·) (K ;)

G(x, |u|) dx


where SG(·)(K; ) = {u  W01,G(·)() : u  1 on K}

Proposition 2.1. Let G(·)  () satisfy (A0) and (A1)..

i) capG(·)(; ) = 0. ii) If K, K are compact sets and  is open set such that K  K    , then

capG(·)(K; )  capG(·)(K; ).

iii) If K  B(x0, r) and 0 < r  s  2r, then

capG(·)(K; B(x0, 2s))  capG(·)(K; B(x0, 2r))  C capG(·)(K; B(x0, 2s)) + sn .

Proof. For i) and ii), we can see [2].

iii) Since the first inequality is trivial, it suffices to verify the second inequality in the extremal

case

s

Let

If

u  SG(·)(K; B(x, 4r)), then u  SG(·)(K; B(x, 2r)), so by Theorem 2.1, we have

capG(·)(K; B(x0, 2r))



G(x, |u|) dx

Taking the infimum over all such functions u, we obtain

capG(·)(K; B(x0, 2r))  C capG(·)(K; B(x0, 4r)) + rn .

This concludes the proof.

3 G(·)-Laplace equation

Let G(·)  (), we consider the following G(·)-Laplace equation

- divg(x|, |u|u|)u = 0.

(3.1)

Definition 3.1. A function h  W 1,G(·)() is G(·)-harmonic in  if it is continuous and G(·)-solution

to equation (3.1) in  i.e



g(x, |h|) |h|

h

·



dx

=

0,

whenever   W01,G(·)().

Definition 3.2. A function u  W 1,G(·)() is a G(·)-supersolution (resp, G(·)-subsolution) to

equation (3.1) in  if



g(x, |u|) |u|

u

·



dx



0

(resp,  0),

whenever   W01,G(·)() and nonnegative.

Given v0  W 1,G(·)() and :   [-, ] be any function. Construct the obstacle set:

K,v0 () = {u  W 1,G(·)() : u  , a.e in  and u - v0  W01,G(.)()}.

By Theorem 4.1 in [5], if K,v0() is not empty then there exits u  K,v0() such that

 g(x|, |u|u|)u · (u - v) dx  0,

whenever v  K,v0(). We said u is a solution of the obstacle problem.
Theorem 3.1. Let G(·)  () satisfies (SC). Then for every v0  W 1,G(·)(), there exists u  W 1,G(·)() a G(·)-solution to equation (3.1) in , such that u - v0  W01,G(·)(). If G(·) is strictly convex and satisfies (A0), the G(·)-solution is unique, and if (A1), (A1,n) hold, then it is continuous.

Proof. Let G(·)  () satisfies (SC) and v0  W 1,G(·)() so K,v0() = . Then there exists a solution u of the obstacle problem in K,v0(). Let   W01,G(·)() then u - , u +   K,v0(). Hence
 g(x|, |u|u|)u ·  dx  0

and -  g(x|, |u|u|)u ·  dx  0.

Consequently



g(x, |u|) |u|

u

·



dx

=

0

whenever   W01,G(·)(). Then u is a G(·)-solution to equation (3.1) in  such that u - v0  W01,G(·)(). When G(·) is strictly convex and satisfies (A0), using the comparison weak principle Lemma 4.3
in [5] the G(·)-solution is unique. If G(·) satisfy (A1), (A1,n) by Corollary 4.1 in [4] a locally
bounded G(·)-solution is locally Hölder continuous. This concludes the proof.

4 Sobolev G(·)-regular boundary points and exterior sphere condition

Definition 4.1. Let G(·)  () strictly convex and satisfy (SC), (A0), (A1) and (A1,n). A
boundary point x0 of a bounded open set  is said to be Sobolev G(·)-regular if, for each function v0  W 1,G(·)()  C(), the G(·)-harmonic function h in  with h - v0  W01,G(·)() satisfies

lim
xx0

h(x)

=

h(x0).

Furthermore, we say that a bounded open set  is Sobolev G(·)-regular if each x0  .

In [14], Harjulehto and Hästö gave the following sufficient condition for the Sobolev G(·)-regular point.

Theorem 4.1. Let x0  . Let G(·)  (Rn) be strictly convex and satisfy (SC), (A0), (A1), and (A1,n). If there exists C  (0, 1) and R > 0 such that

capG(·)(B(x0, r)\; B(x0, 2r))  CcapG(·)(B(x0, r); B(x0, 2r)) for all 0 < r < R.
Then x0 is a Sobolev G(·)-regular point.
Definition 4.2. We say that a boundary point x0 of a bounded open set  satisfies the exterior sphere condition, if there is a ball B(y0, ) such that B(y0, )   = {x0}. Furthermore, we say that a bounded open set  satisfies the exterior sphere condition if each x0  .
Lemma 4.1. Let G(·)  (B) with  > 1 satisfies (SC). Then there exits a positive constant C = C(n, g0, g0, ) such that

1 C

|G-B

1 r

 capG(·)(B; B)  C|B|G+B

Proof.

Let

that

G(x, |u|) dx  C|B|G-B

.

This concludes the proof.

Theorem 4.2. Let G(·)  () strictly convex and satisfy (SC), (A0), (A1) and (A1,n). If  satisfies the exterior sphere condition, then  is Sobolev G(·)-regular.

Proof. Let  satisfies the exterior sphere condition. Then for every x0   there exists a ball B(y0, r) such that B(y0, r)   = {x0}. So we have B(x0, 3r)\ contains B(y0, r). Then, by Proposition 2.1 and Lemma 4.1, we have

capG(·)(B(x0, 3r)\; B(x0, 6r))

 CcapG(·)(B(y0, r); B(x0, 6r))

 CcapG(·)(B(y0, r); B(y0, 8r))

 C|B(y0, r)|G-B(y0,8r)

1 r

 C|B(x0, 3r)|G-B(y0,8r)

1 r

By the condition (A1,n) there exists a constant C > 0 such that

G+B (y0 ,8r)

1 r

 CG-B(y0,8r)

1 r

Using again Lemma 4.1 we obtain

capG(·)(B(x0, 3r)\; B(x0, 6r))

 C|B(x0, 3r)|G+B(y0,8r)

1 r

 C|B(x0, 3r)|G+B(x0,6r)

1 r

 CcapG(·)(B(x0, 3r); B(x0, 6r))

for r small enough, so by Theorem 4.1 we have  is Sobolev G(·)-regular.

Corollary 4.1. Let G(·)  () strictly convex and satisfy (SC), (A0), (A1) and (A1,n). All balls are Sobolev G(·)-regular.

Consequently, every open set can be exhausted by Sobolev G(·)-regular open sets as a consequence of this corollary.

5 The Perron-Wiener-Brelot method
5.1 Upper and lower Perron G(·)-solution
Let G(·)  (). A function u :   R  {} is called G(·)-superharmonic in  if i) u is lower semicontinuous, ii) u   in ,
iii) for each domain D   the comparison principle holds: if h  C(D) is G(·)-harmonic in D and u  h on D then u  h in D.
A function v :   R  {-} is called G(·)-subharmonic in  if i) u is upper semicontinuous, ii) u  - in ,
iii) for each domain D   the comparison principle holds: if h  C(D) is G(·)-harmonic in D and u  h on D then u  h in D.
For f :   [-, ] be a function, we define as in classical potential theory [17] two classes of functions:
· The upper class Uf consists of all functions v :   (-, ] such that i) v is G(·)-superharmonic in , ii) v is bounded below,
iii) lim infx v(x)  f () when   . · The lower class Lf consists of all functions u :   [-, ) such that
i) u is G(·)-subharmonic in , ii) u is bounded above, iii) lim supx u(x)  f () when   . We define at each point in 
The upper Perron G(·)-solution Hf (x) = inf v(x) vUf
The lower Perron G(·)-solution Hf (x) = sup v(x) vLf
If Uf =  (or Lf = ), then we have Hf =  (and Hf = - respectively).
The following lemma gives simple properties for Perron G(·)-solutions. Lemma 5.1. Let f :   [-, ] be a function, we have the following properties
9

1) Hf = -H-f 2) Hf  Hf 3) if f  g, then Hf  Hg 4) for   R, we have Hf+ = Hf +  and Hf = Hf For 3) and 4), a similar statement is true if Hf is replace by Hf .

5.2 The Poisson modification
Generally, to construct the Poisson modification, the Harnack Convergence theorem and the comparison principle are needed (see [11]).
Theorem 5.1 (Harnack Convergence theorem). Let G(·)  () satisfies (SC). Suppose that ui is a G(·)-harmonic such that

0  u1  u2  ..., u = lim ui, pointwise in .
Then, either u =  or u is a G(·)-harmonic in .
Lemma 5.2 (Comparison principle). Let G(·)  () satisfies (SC). Suppose that u is a G(·)-subharmonic and v is a G(·)-superharmonic in  such that

lim sup u(x)  lim inf v(x)

xy

xy

for all y  . If the left and right-hand sides are neither  nor - at the same time, then

u  v in .

Let G(·)  () strictly convex and satisfy (SC), (A0), (A1) and (A1,n). Given a Sobolev G(·)-regular subdomain D   (see Corollary 4.1) and v is G(·)-superharmonic fonction in . Since v is lower semicontinuous in , there exists a sequence vi  C() such that

v1



v2



...



v

and

lim
i

vi(x)

=

v(x)

at each

x



.

Let hi be the G(·)-harmonic function in D such that hi - vi  W01,G(·)(D). Applying the Sobolev G(·)-regularity of D and the comparison principle, we get

h1  h2  ...  v in D.
By the Harnack convergence theorem, the function h = limi hi is G(·)-harmonic. We define the Poisson modification P (v, D) as follows

P (v, D) =

h in D v in \D.

10

Remark 5.1. If v  W 1,G(·)(), then the Poisson modification of v is defined as follows

P (v, D) =

h in D v in \D

where h is the G(·)-harmonic function in D such that h - v  W01,G(·)(D).
Theorem 5.2. Let G(·)  () strictly convex and satisfy (SC), (A0), (A1) and (A1,n). Let D   be a G(·)-regular subdomain and v is a G(·)-superharmonic function in . Then the Poisson modification P (v, D) is G(·)-superharmonic function in , G(·)-harmonic function in D and P (v, D)  v..

Proof. By the construction of the Poisson modification, we have P (v, D) is a G(·)-harmonic function in D, and h  v in D, so
P (v, D)  v in .
We show that P (v, D) is lower semicontinuous. Let   D

lim inf P (v, D) = lim inf v(x)  v() = P (v, D)()

and

lim inf P (v, D)(x) = lim inf h(x)  lim inf hi(x) = vi().

So,
lim inf P (v, D)(x)  v() = P (v, D)(). x xD

Next, we prove P (v, D) satisfies the comparison principle. Indeed, let G   is a domain and
H  C(G) is G(·)-harmonic function in G with H G  P (v, D) G. We have P (v, D)  v in , then H G  v G. As v is G(·)-superharmonic function, then H  v in G. Hence,
H  P (v, D) in G\D.

Let   (G  D), we have So Then

H()  v()  lim inf h(x). x xDG

lim inf H(x)  lim inf h(x).

H  h = P (v, D) in D  G.

Hence

H  P (v, D) in G.

Therefore P (v, D) is G(·)-superharmonic function in .

5.3 G(·)-resolutivity

Definition 5.1. Let G(·)  () strictly convex and satisfy (SC), (A0), (A1) and (A1,n). We say that a function f :   [-, ] is G(·)-resolutive if the upper and the lower Perron G(·)-solution Hf and Hf coincide and are G(·)-harmonic in .
Definition 5.2. A family U of functions is down ward directed if for each u, v  U, there is s  U with s  min(u, v)

The following Lemma is fundamental in PWB method [16]. The first recall that the lower semicontinuous regularization u of any function u :   [-, ] is defined by

u(x) := lim inf u. r0 B(x,r)

Lemma 5.3 (Choquet's topological lemma). Suppose E  RN and that U = {u,   I} is a family of functions u : E  [-, ]. Let u = inf U. If U is down ward directed, then there
is a decreasing sequence of functions vj  U with limit v such that the lower semicontinuous regularizations u and v coincide.

Theorem 5.3. Let G(·)  () strictly convex and satisfy (SC), (A0), (A1) and (A1,n). Then one of the following alternatives is true

i) Hf is G(·)-harmonic in ,

ii) Hf  -,

iii) Hf  .

A similar statement is true for Hf .
Proof. If the upper class Uf is empty, then Hf = . Suppose that the upper class Uf is not empty, then Uf is down ward directed. So, by Choquet's topological lemma, there exists a decreasing sequence of functions ui  Uf convergent to a function u such that u = Hf in . Let D   is a Sobolev G(·)-regular and consider the Poisson modification P (ui, D). Using Theorem 5.2, we have P (ui, D)  Uf . Then, by the Harnack convergence theorem, limi P (ui, D) is either G(·)-harmonic or identically - in D. As Hf  P (ui, D)  ui and u = Hf , then Hf = limi P (ui, B) in D. Therefore Hf is either G(·)-harmonic or identically - in .
Theorem 5.4 (Wiener theorem). Let G(·)  () strictly convex and satisfy (SC), (A0), (A1) and (A1,n). Suppose that f :   R is continuous. Then f is G(·)-resolutive in , i.e Hf = Hf := Hf .
Proof. Let f :   R is a continuous function. By the Tietze extension theorem, we can assume f  C(Rn), then there exists i  C(Rn) such that for all  > 0, we have

i() -  < f () < i() +  when   .

Thus,

Hi -   Hi-  Hf  Hf  H i+  Hi + .

12

So, if Hi = Hi, then Hf = Hf . Hence, it suffices to prove the result for i. Let Hi be a G(·)-harmonic in  such that Hi - i  W01,G(·)(). Let vi denote the G(·)-solution to obstacle problem with i acting as obstacle and also boundary data. So vi  Uf . Choose
Sobolev G(·)-regular domains Dj   such that  = j1Dj and D1  D2  .... Construct
the sequence of Poisson modification

Pi,j = P (vi, Dj)

Then {Pi,j}j is non-increasing, Pi,j  Uf and Pi,j - i. Then Pi,j - i = Pi,j - vi + vi - i 
W01,G(·)(). Let Pi = limj Pi,j. As Hi  Pi,j, then by the Harnack convergence theorem Pi is G(·)-harmonic in  and Pi - i  W01,G(·)(). So, Pi = Hi in . Hence Hi  Pi = Hi. By a similar proof, we have Hi  Hi. Then

Hi  Hi  Hi  Hi.

Hence This concludes the proof.

Hi = H i.

As a consequence of the previous theorem, the Perron G(·)-solution coincides with the G(·)-solution of Dirichlet-Sobolev with boundary f .

Corollary 5.1. Let G(·)  () strictly convex and satisfy (SC), (A0), (A1) and (A1,n). If f  W 1,G(·)()  C(). Then Hf is the unique G(·)-harmonic function such that H - f  W01,G(·)().

6 G(·)-potential

Definition 6.1. Let G(·)  () strictly convex and satisfy (SC), (A0), (A1) and (A1,n). Let K  B be compact and   C0(B) be such that  = 1 on K. We define the G(·)-potential for
K with respect to B as follows

RG(·)(K, B) :=

h in B\K 1 in K

where h is the unique G(·)-harmonic function in B\K such that h -   W01,G(·)(B\K).
Remark 6.1. The definition of RG(·)(K, B) is independent of the particular choice of . Indeed, if ~ is another such that h~ is the unique G(·)-harmonic function in B\K such that h~ - ~  W01,G(·)(B\K), then h-h~  W01,G(·)(B\K) and by the uniqueness we have h = h~ in W01,G(·)(B\K).

6.1 G(·)-potential and G(·)-capacity
Using the same method, as in [10], we prove the following lemma.
Lemma 6.1. Let G(·)  (B)  C1(R+) satisfies (SC) and u = RG(·)(K, B) the G(·)-potential for K with respect to B. Then u is a G(·)-supersolution in B.

13

Proof. Let G(·)  ()  C1(R+). In [15] we have u is a G(·)-supersolution in B equivalently

G(x, |u|) dx  G(x, |(u + )|) dx

B

B

for every nonnegative function  in W01,G(·)(B). So, we can assume that u +   1, a.e in B. As u = 1 in K, then the inequality u +   1 a.e. implies that  = 0 a.e. on K. Hence
  W01,G(·)(B\K). Since u is a G(·)-harmonic function in B\K, then

G(x, |u|) dx =

G(x, |u|) dx 

G(x, |(u+)|) dx  G(x, |(u+)|) dx.

B

B\K

B\K

B

Therefore u is a G(·)-supersolution in B.

Using the Riesz representation theorem, we have the following theorem.

Lemma 6.2. Let G(·)  (). For every G(·)-supersolution u in , there is a Radon measure

µ[u] 

W01,G(·)()


such that

 g(x|, |u|u|)u ·  dx =

 dµ[u]


whenever   W01,G(·)().

Theorem 6.1. Let G(·)  (B)  C1(R+) satisfies (SC) and K be a compact subset of B. If
u = RG(·)(K, B) is the G(·)-potential for K with respect to B and µ[u] its associated Radon measure in W01,G(·)(B), then there exists a constant C > 0 such that

1 C

CapG(·) (K ;

B)



µ[u](K )



C CapG(·) (K ;

B)

Proof. Let u the G(·)-potential for K with respect to B and µ[u] its associated Radon measure in

W01,G(·)(B). As u is G(·)-harmonic in B\K, then the support of the measure µ[u] is contained in

K. Hence

µ[u](K) = µ[u](B) =

u dµ[u] =

On the other hand, let   SG(·)(K; ) and we consider  = max{ - u, u}, so the nonnegative function  - u  W01,G(·)(B). Since u is a G(·)-supersolution, we have

B

Taking the infimum of the functions   SG(·)(K; B), we obtain

µ[u](K)  CcapG(·)(K; B).

This concludes the proof.

6.2 Estimation of G(·)-potential

In [4], we proved the following Caccioppoli type estimate of supersolutions to equation (3.1).

Lemma 6.3. Let G(·)  (2B) satisfies (SC). Let u be a nonpositive G(·)-supersolution of (3.1)

Lemma 6.4. Let G(·)  (B(x0, 2r)) satisfy (SC), (A0) and (A1,n). If u is a nonnegative G(·)-supersolution in B(x0, 2r), then, for some constant C > 0, we have

C rg -1

 ess inf u + R, B (x0 ,r)

with µ[u] is the associated Radon measure to u in

W01,G(·)(B(x0, 2r))


.

Proof. We set B = B(x0, r), b = infB u and, v = min{u, b} + r. Choose  = vg0 such that

This concludes the proof.

By a similar proof in [8], we have the following lemma.
Lemma 6.5. Let G(·)  () satisfies (SC). Let f  W 1,G(·)() and v be a G(·)-supersolution in  such that f - v  W01,G(·)(). Then the solution of the obstacle problem with the obstacle v and the boundary data f is a G(·)-solution in .

Theorem 6.2. Let x0  . Let G(·)  (Rn)  C1(R+) be strictly convex and satisfy (SC), (A0), (A1), and (A1,n). Fix r > 0, and let u = RG(·)(B(x0, r)\, B(x0, 4r)) be the G(·)-potential for B(x0, r)\ with respect to B(x0, 4r). Then for 0 <   r and x  B(x0, ), we have

7 Criterion Wiener

First of all, the notion of the regularity of boundary points is defined in connection with Perron G(·)-solutions.

Definition 7.1. Let G(·)  (). A boundary point x0 of an open set  is called G(·)-regular if

for each continuous f :   R.

lim

The following lemma shows that G(·)-regularity is a local property.

for each bounded f :   R, continuous at x0.

21

Proof. Let x0   be G(·)-regular and fix  > 0. Let U be an neighborhood of x0 such that |f - f (x0)| <  on U  . Then, choose a continuous function g :   [f (x0) + , sup |f | + ] such that g(x0) = f (x0) +  and g = sup |f | +  on \U. Now g  f on  and hence we have

lim sup

Hf (x)

Lemma 7.2. Let G(·)  (). Assume that f :   R is G(·)-resolutive. Let    be open and define f~ :   R by

f~(x) =

f (x) if x     Hf (x) if x    .

Then f~ is G(·)-resolutive with respect to  and the Perron G(·)-solution for f~ in  is Hf 
Proof. Let f :   R be a G(·)-resolutive,    and u  Uf . As u is lower semicontinuous, then for each y  
lim u(y)  f~(x) for all x  .
yx
Hence u  Uf~ for f~ in . So taking infimum over all u,we have

Hf~  Hf . Applying the same argument to -f , we obtain

Hf~  Hf~  Hf = -H-f  -Hf~  Hf~ in .

This concludes the proof.

Theorem 7.1. Let G(·)  (Rn)  C1(R+) be strictly convex and satisfy (SC), (A0), (A1), and (A1,n). The point x0   is G(·)-regular if and only if for some  > 0,

Let u be the G(·)-potential for B(x0, r)\ with respect to B(x0, 4r) and f~be as in Lemme 7.2 with  :=   4B. So, we put B = B(x0, r) , m = sup2B(f - f (x0)) and M = sup(f - f (x0)). Then, we have
h - f (x0)  m + M(1 - u) on .
Using Lemma 5.1 and Lemma 7.2, we get

Hf - f (x0) = Hh  - f (x0)  Hh-f(x0)   Hm+M(1-u) = m + M (1 - u) on . Hence, from Theorem 6.2, we have

supB(x0,) (Hf - f (x0))  sup2B (f - f (x0))

+ sup (f - f (x0)) exp

-C g-1

capG(·)(B(x0,

dt + Cr .

So, by the condition (7.1) for all sufficiently small 0 <   r, we get

sup (Hf - f (x0))  2.
B (x0 ,)
Then Hf is continuous at x0 and as f  C() was arbitrary, which implies that x0 is G(·)-regular. For the converse, by Theorem 6.3, we have

lim inf u(x)  C xx0

B(x0,

dt + r .

By the condition (7.1), we can find r > 0 sufficiently small so that

lim inf u(x) < 1. xx0
As u is solution of the Sobolev-Dirichlet problem in 4B\(B  ) with the continuous boundary data 1 on K and 0 on (4B), then x0 is not G(·)-regular.
