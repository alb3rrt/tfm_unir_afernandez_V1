## Abstract

Multi-scale feedback systems, where information cycles through micro- and macro-scales leading to adaptation, are ubiquitous across domains, from animal societies and human organisations to electric grids and neural networks. Studies on the effects of timing on system properties are often domain specific. The Multi-Scale Abstraction Feedbacks (MSAF) design pattern aims to generalise the description and understanding of multi-scale systems where feedback occurs across scales. We expand on MSAF to include timing considerations. We then apply these considerations to two models: a hierarchical oscillator (HO) and a hierarchical cellular automata (HCA). Results show how (i) different timing configurations significantly affect system macro-properties and (ii) different regions of time configurations can lead to the same macro-properties. These results contribute to theory, while also providing useful insights for designing and controlling such systems.
