Abstract--We present novel lower bounds on the localization error using a network of satellites randomly deployed on a sphere around Earth. Our new analysis approach characterizes the localization performance by its asymptotic behavior as the number of satellites gets large while assuming a dense network. Using the law of large numbers, we derive closed-form expressions for the asymptotic Crame´r Rao bound (CRB) from which we draw valuable insights. The resulting expressions depend solely on the network statistics and are not a function of a particular network configuration. We consider two types of estimators. The first uses the exact statistical model, and hence employs both timing and amplitude information. The second estimator ignores the amplitudes and hence uses only time difference of arrival (TDOA) information. The asymptotic CRB indicates that for practical system setup, a TDOA estimator approaches the performance of the ideal estimator. For both estimators, the localization accuracy improves as satellites get closer to Earth. The latter finding is essential in light of the proliferation of lowEarth-orbit (LEO) satellites and motivates a further study of localization-performance in such networks. Besides, we show that the vertical localization accuracy is lower than the horizontal accuracy and is also more sensitive to the receiver field-of-view.
I. INTRODUCTION
Localization using satellites has long been widespread but has attracted renewed interest due to the launching of rising numbers of satellites [1­3]. Traditional global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) include the American GPS, the Russian GLONASS (e.g., [4]), the Chinese BeiDou (e.g., [5]) and the European Galileo (e.g., [6]). The current trend in GNSS utilizes multiple GNSS types to improve localization accuracy (e.g., [7]). This trend underscores the importance of studying localization accuracy with a large number of satellites. Furthermore, the recent launches of low earth orbit (LEO) communication satellites (such as OneWeb [8]) enables new alternatives for high precision localization through these satellites. Each of these constellations is expected to have thousands of satellites. This paper focuses on the characterization of localization accuracy with a large number of satellites.
In any GNSS, the user computes its position from signals transmitted by a set of visible satellites. These systems are commonly used for security, communication, surveillance, reconnaissance, traffic monitoring and other applications (e.g., [9, 10]).
State-of-the-art localization methods utilize time difference of arrival (TDOA) [11­25], frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) or both [15, 26, 27]. Localization information is

also embedded in the received signal strength (RSS) [28­32] but is generally known (and proved below) to be negligible for satellite localization. This work analyzes the asymptotic performance of a system with a large number of satellites using TDOA or TDOA+RSS. Asymptotic performance with FDOA is left for future research.
The Crame´r-Rao lower bound (CRB) is an essential tool for the performance analysis of localization systems. However, in many configurations, mainly when there are many sensors, the CRB expression is complicated and hard to interpret. Moreover, an expression that depends on a specific configuration is inconvenient since satellite-network geometry varies over time.
Incorporating randomness can lead to a more informative expression, which depends solely on a few system parameters. For example, in ground based localization, Zheng et al. [33] investigated the sensor-density effect on localization performance and bounded the expected CRB for RSS-based estimation (using a non-standard attenuation model in which the signal decayed exponentially with the squared distance). Shoari and A. Seyedi [34] also treated the CRB as a random variable depending on the sensor locations. They provided closed-form lower and upper bounds on the localization performance in the presence of Rayleigh fading, using the Law of Large Numbers. Bergel and Noam [35] derived the expected CRB for Poisson point process sensor-locations, using closedform expressions for the CRB that were derived by [36].
In this paper, we examine the case of numerous satellites and use the Law of Large Numbers to calculate the localization-accuracy asymptotic behavior, as a function of the number of satellites, for systems that employ either TDOA or TDOA+RSS localization. The analysis reveals new insights on satellite localization systems. In particular, for a given number of satellites, we show that localization accuracy is better as the satellites heights get lower, as long as we maintain sufficient coverage. We also show that the vertical localization accuracy is lower than the horizontal accuracy, and is also more sensitive to the receiver field of view.
The remainder of this paper is as follows. In Section II we formulate the problem, including the signal model, assumptions about the system and the unknown parameters. In Section III, we derive the asymptotic CRB for TDOA+RSS receiver localization in satellites. In Section IV, we derive the asymptotic performance of TDOA only receiver localization via a satellite network, and show that it is close to optimal in practical setups. The section also includes valuable insights. Simulation results appear in Section V. Section VI includes a summary and conclusions.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

We consider the localization of a single land terminal (LT) at an unknown location through a network of N satellites.
The satellites are uniformly distributed on a sphere of radius R = re + h~ around the Earth, where h~ is the satellite height relative to Earth surface, and re is Earth radius.1 Without loss of generality, we assume that the LT is horizontally located at the true North Pole. That is, the LT is at an elevation  above
the north pole. We also denote the distance of the LT from the Earth center by r = re +  . We will assume throughout that   re and   h. Thus, in the text we will refer to r also as the Earth radius. Yet, we emphasize that the exact meaning of r (and the only way that it is used in the equations) is the LT
distance from the Earth center. For mathematical simplicity,
it is also convenient to work with the relative satellite height h = h~ -  (thus, R = r + h and again h is approximately equal to ~h).
We use three coordinate-systems. The first is an Earth-
centered, Earth-fixed (ECEF) [38] cartesian right hinged sys-
tem, used for reference and error calculation. The other two
coordinate systems are spherical. One is centered at Earth center and is called the E coordinates. Here, the LT is located at the point (r, 0, 90), that is, at radius r, azimuth 0 and elevation 90, respectively, whereas satellite-m is at (R, E,m, E,m) where R = r + h.
The second spherical coordinate system is centered at the LT and is called the L coordinates. Note that azimuth is identical in both systems, L,m = E,m, whereas the elevation angles are not. The latter two satisfy

1In reality, satellite constellation design aims at maximizing coverage. Thus the probability of two satellites being near each other is typically smaller than in a uniformly distributed constellation. However, the satellite distribution is becoming more uniform as their number increases. Furthermore, in the case of multi-GNSS, the combined distribution is typically close to uniform.

is the distance between the LT and satellite-m. We assume the LT points upward (to space) and has a viewing angle 2L,max, 0 < L,max < /2, as depicted in Fig. 1. We denote satellite m location by m = [xm, ym, zm] and collect all these points in N1 = [1 . . . N ]. Finally, we denote the unknown parameter of interest (the LT position) by  = [x, y, z].
The signal transmission begins at time t = T0, unknown to the receiver. Typically, GNSS uses Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA) to differentiate the signals from different satellites. For simplicity, we consider Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA), in which the same signal is transmitted by different satellites at different times. Note that the performance of TDMA and CDMA are nearly identical (e.g., [39]).
We assume that different satellites transmit with a large enough time difference so there is no inter-satellite interference and the noise is independent while receiving these signals. Without contradicting the above, we also assume that the transmission time gap between satellites is small enough such that the movement of the LT during this time is negligible. The transmission time gap between satellites is known to the LT and hence has no effect on the performance. Thus, in the following we ignore this time gap, and simply assume that the LT can receive each of the satellites signal independently of the others.
Satellite m signal as received at the LT is given by [35]

rm(t) = Dm-1s(t - m - T )1 0 [L,m<L,max] + vm(t) (3)

where t  R+, m  N, s(t) is a known transmitted waveform,

1[·] denotes the indicator function and vm(t) is a white Gaussian noise with spectral density N0/2. The propagation

time delay is m = Dm/c, where c is the speed of light. In this

paper we consider the estimation of  from the observations

{rm}Nm=1, observed by the LT. We assume the following regularity conditions: s(t) is continuous, differentiable, equals

0 for all t  0 and there exists a non negative function g(t),

III. ASYMPTOTIC PERFORMANCE FOR TDOA+RSS

We now derive an asymptotic expression for the CRB as the number of satellites increases. We first derive the CRB(N1 ) on the estimation error of  as a function of the satellite locations, N1 , and then evaluate its limiting behavior as N increases. According to the Crame´r-Rao theorem [40], the
maximum likelihood estimator performance converges to the
CRB for high enough SNR. Note that during the derivation of CRB(N1 ), the satellites locations N1 are considered deterministic.
The estimation uses continuous-time signals, and hence,
may exploit both TDOA and RSS information. The Fisher
information matrix (FIM) for estimating  is

Let ^ = [x^, y^, z^] be an unbiased estimate of . Here,

we consider three kinds of localization errors: the overall 3D error exyz = ^ -  , a horizontal error exy =
(x^ - x)2 + (y^ - y)2 and the altitude error ez = |z^- z|. The

CRB on each error is the sum of the corresponding diagonal

entries of the inverse FIM. Moreover, the first CRB is equal

to the sum of the two others,

CRBxyz(N1 ) = CRBxy(N1 ) + CRBz(N1 )

(9)

where CRBxy(N1 ) = [J-1]1,1 + [J-1]2,2 and CRBz(N1 ) = [J-1]3,3. Recalling that the satellite-locations N1 are random, it follows that the CRB is also random. Thus, we define the
following limiting expressions:

where the limit is in the almost sure convergence sense. The following theorem expresses the first two quantities in closed form as a function of the system parameters (see Fig. 1).

Proof: see Appendix A. While (11) and (12) seem complicated, they well characterize the achievable localization accuracy for a large number of satellites. Section IV provides further insights from these expressions. Before that, the following section characterizes the performance of estimators that only utilize timing data (TDOA). Such an approach is important because (as proved bellow) amplitude data (RSS) contribution is negligible in satellite localization (with a reasonable transmission bandwidth).
IV. ASYMPTOTIC PERFORMANCE FOR TDOA
A. Estimation Based Solely on TDOA
An estimator that utilizes timing information while ignoring the signal strength information is, by definition, sub-optimal. Thus, its performance cannot be characterized by the CRB of the problem. Instead, we need to consider the performance of a specific estimator. To this end we consider the maximum likelihood estimator in an alternative channel model, in which the signal strength is not a function of the receiver location, by replacing the signal in (3) with
r~m(t) = Ams(t - m - T )1 0 [L,m<L,max] + vm(t). (14)
Here, the overall unknown parameter vector is  = [, a], where the amplitudes a = [A1 . . . , AN ] are a nuisance parameter-vector. We denote the probability distribution induced by the alternative model as P~ and the corresponding likelihood by L~(r1 . . . rN , ~). In the sequel, we derive the ML estimator of ~ from the distribution P~. Note that the latter estimator considers the amplitudes, a, as a separate parameter vector, which is not a function {Dm}Nm=1, hence not a function of the RSS.

B. Mismodeling
We now study the performance of the estimator derived while assuming that (14) holds while (3) is the actual signalmodel. Here, the expression for the CRB under (14), dubbed mismodeled CRB in this subsection, is not a lower bound on the mean square error (MSE) of every estimator. The problem of deriving estimators under a model that is not the actual

probability distribution governing the observations is known

as mismodeling. While the mismodeled CRB is not a general

lower bound, it is a very useful tool if the performance of ML

under mismodeling approaches it asymptotically. A sufficient

condition for such a convergence is the following:

Theorem 2 ([41]): Considering an estimator that performs ML based on the likelihood f (r(t); ) for estimating    from the observation r(t), where g(r(t)) be the likelihood function based on the actual distribution of r(t). The ML-

MSE of the considered estimator approaches the CRB derived under f (r(t); ) if there exists   , dubbed "legal" , such that g(r(t)) = f (r(t); ).
We note that in the problem at hand, Am = Dm-1 yields a "legal" parameter vector (). Explicitly, considering Theorem 2, the actual distribution (g(r(t)) in the theorem) is defined by

a, while the parametric family in the theorem), the parametric

family, L~(r1, . . . , LN , ~) is obtained under the non-physical

model in (14), but, it does include the actual likelihood.

The latter is a special case of L~(~r, ~) when substituting

Am = Dm-1, in ~, where Dm, is the actual distance between

satellite-m and the LT.

Thus, the ML performance are indeed characterized by

deriving the CRB for the model in (14). While using the

notation CRB for the CRB formula of the model (14), we

remember that this is not an actual bound, and use it solely

to characterize the ML performance. In the next subsection,

we show that this performance is very close to the true CRB (derived in Section III) when We is large enough. Thus, this alternative model yields convenient, closed-form-expression

for performance analysis.

The corresponding FIM for ~ estimation is

Similar to the RSS-TDOA case, we consider three kinds of estimation errors:

where Jamp = 2IN is the FIM for estimating a and J~ is the FIM for the estimation of , which we present below. Now that the amplitudes are unknown nuisance parameters, we begin with evaluating their effect on the localization error. In Appendix B, we show no coupling between the estimation of  and the estimation of a. Explicitly, Jcros is zero; hence CRB for estimating  is unchanged whether a is estimated or known in advance. Henceforth, we assume that the amplitudes are known and focus on the unknown . Similar to J (see (8)), the FIM J~ for estimating  is

Proof: see Appendix C. Although very popular [14­22, 42, 43], estimation based solely on TDOA is not optimal. In practice, however, TDOA is significantly more informative than RSS. The following lemma guarantees that RSS information is negligible for large enough bandwidth. Lemma 4: For the system defined in Sec. II,

(24)

To illustrate the latter approximation, consider a satellite at 20,000 km height. The minimal bandwidth at which (24) is satisfied is 15 Hz, where the typical bandwidth is at least one MHz. Thus, in most practical scenarios, the RSS effect on the estimation accuracy is negligible.
Now that we showed that estimation solely utilizing TDOA is near-optimal in most practical scenarios, we turn our attention to evaluating its performance. The latter analysis is even further motivated because TDOA localization is simpler than localization that also combines RSS.2 Moreover, the asymptotic expression for TDOA localization-accuracy, (LCRB), is much simpler than the asymptotic CRB (although nearly identical in practice).
For a sufficient number of satellites, Theorem 3 provides a good approximation for the localization accuracy, CRB (cf. (19)), as follows:

CRBxy(N1 )  ACRBxy

LCRBxy N

CRBz(N1 )  ACRBz

LCRBz N

(25)

and combining the latter two yields the following approximated for the actual localization accuracy (see (18)). Unlike the exact CRB, ACRB is not a function of a particular satellite configuration, but only of some general system parameters. Therefore, the latter can even be used for determining these parameters and enhanced performance already in the design phase before deploying such a massive constellation. More importantly, the exact CRB depends on the location of each of the satellites, which continually change, while the ACRB provides a good approximation, without considering specific satellite locations. We further demonstrate how useful ACRB is in the next section.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS
We now turn to numerical analysis for further insights and to demonstrate the theory. In all simulations, unless stated otherwise, the satellites height is h = 20000 Km;  = 6.4 · 1013; the LT coverage (maximal viewing) angle is L,max = 60 (which is equivalent to E,max = 47.93, measured from Earth's center, for satellites at h = 20000 Km); and Earth's radius is r = 6371 Km. Finally, as described in Sec. II, the satellites are uniformly distributed around the Earth.
2Hence RSS is rare in practical satellite localization.

compared to the corresponding CRB. Two models are considered separately: in the first one the z coordinate is considered known so only MSExy is examined, whereas in the second model the z coordinate is assumed to be unknown and MSExyz is examined.

A. Performance of ML Estimator
As a first step, we show that the (non asymptotic) CRB, CRB indeed predicts the performance of the TDOA based ML estimator. We consider the localization when one satellite is located precisely above the terminal and five more satellites are evenly distributed on the circle at elevation L = 30. Hence, the received energy from the central satellite is, by definition, Es,max, while the received energy from the other satellites is lower due to their larger distance. Following our TDOA localization approach (see Sec. IV), the terminal estimated the amplitudes and location jointly via the ML estimator based on (14). We evaluated the localization MSE by averaging the error using 1000 Monte Carlo trials and compared it to the corresponding CRB, CRB, as a function of Es,max/N0.
Fig. 2 depicts the localization error for two estimation scenarios. In the first, we assumed that the receiver knows the z coordinate, whereas, in the second, it does not, hence performing 2D and 3D TDOA-based localization, respectively. The figure presents the MSE compared to CRBxy and CRBxyz (see (25) and (18)), for the first and the second case, respectively. The results corroborate the well-known asymptotic efficiency of the ML estimator; i.e., beyond a threshold SNR, the estimator operates in the small error regime where the MSE approaches the lower bound. Moreover, as expected, 2D localization is more accurate than 3D localization. However, the factor of more than ten between the two indicates that estimating altitude (z coordinate) is challenging compared to

B. Performance Convergence
We now study the convergence of N · CRB to the corresponding bound LCRB. Fig. 3 depicts the empirical probability density function (PDF) of N · CRBs based on 40000 random network realizations for various satellite numbers. The figure shows both the PDFs of N · CRBxy and of N · CRBz, as well as the theoretical limits (20) and (21). The results demonstrate the increasing accuracy of the limiting expression as the number of satellites grows. Fig. 4 studies the latter convergence in terms of the empirical median of the random CRB. The figure error bars (here and for all subsequent figures) mark the 10th and 90th percentiles of the CRB. For each simulation point, we used 200 Monte Carlo trials, each with an independent realization of N1 , from which we calculated CRB(N1 ). The figure shows that CRB empirical median converges to the corresponding ACRB as the number of satellites gets large. Recall that the strip created by the error bars encapsulates 80% of the CRB

C. Height and Angle Effect and Coverage Probability
We now study the effect of h and max on the convergence rate of CRB toward ACRB. Fig. 5 depicts the median CRB and the ACRB as a function of the LT coverage angle, L,max, for 250 and 2000 satellites uniformly distributed around Earth. In all cases, increasing L,max reduces the CRB, implying improved estimation accuracy. The improvement is due to the increased LT coverage-angle that allows reception from more satellites. Moreover, the additional received satellites as L,max increases further decreases the gap between the error bars. Interestingly, the increase in L,max affects CRBz more than CRBxy. The intuition behind this observation is that for small L,max, all satellites are approximately above the terminal, thus enhancing the horizontal resolution more than the vertical one. As L,max increases, the receiver gets signals from different directions, thus improving its z-axis resolution.
Note that 3D TDOA localization requires at least four satellites. Consequently, besides localization-accuracy, we need to consider also the localization-identifiability; i.e., the probability of having four satellites in the LT coverage cup. To better understand the identifiability, we define the coverage probability as the probability of having four or more satellites in the LT coverage cup. The probability that a given satellite is in the coverage cup is

satellites are too low, their average number within the LT

coverage cup is small, thus rendering the asymptotic analysis

unsuitable. We further discuss this trade-off in the following

subsection.

From (27), the minimal height ensuring a 90% coverage

(which is the curves initial heights) for L,max = 60 is

100

2400 km and 500 km for 200 and 2000 satellites, respectively.

We, therefore, conclude that the monotonic increase of ACRB

with the height is useful only above a height that guarantees

Note that actual satellite constellation (e.g., GPS) may achieve better coverage for the same number of satellites, as explained in Footnote 1. This is achieved by careful planning of the satellites' orbits. However, the planning becomes very difficult for larger constellations, and does not hold at all for multi-GNSS localization.
From (27) one may evaluate the minimal coverage-angle guaranteeing a given coverage probability. For example, for satellites at 20 000 km height, a 90% coverage probability is achieved with L,max = 24.5 and L,max = 8.7 for 250 and 2000 satellites, respectively. Fig. 5 (as well as Fig. 4 and Fig. 6) only presents results for scenarios with at least 90% coverage. As the coverage probability is higher in the 2000satellite deployment, this curve indeed starts at a smaller angle than the 250-satellite curve.
Fig. 6 depicts the empirical median of CRB and the corre-
sponding limit, ACRB, as a function of the satellites height, h. The figure considers 200 and 2000 satellites randomly scattered around Earth. Note that the number of satellites within the LT coverage cup increases as h increases (keeping L,max = 60), but at a lower rate than in the previous figure; i.e., changing h from 5000 km to 35000 km increases the number of visible satellites by only 70%. Thus, the gap between the error bars decreases but does not disappear as h increases.
Despite the increasing number of visible satellites, the
theoretical ACRB gets larger with h. We thus conclude that if there is a sufficient amount of satellites, they should be located as closer to Earth as possible.
However, as Fig. 6 shows, one should caution when using the latter conclusion with a finite number of satellites. If the

Proof: see Appendix E.
Fig. 7 depicts the asymptotic factors of Theorem 5. We depict each xy and z as is, whereas, to adjust the graph units, we multiply xy and z by h2. As expected, both  and  decrease when the angle increases. Interestingly, at low angles, the xy and xy scale as -4 whereas the z and z scale as -6. Beyond corroboration, the aforementioned observation quantifies our previous conclusion regarding the
higher dependence of the vertical estimation on coverage
angle. The h2 scaling of the ACRB calls for comment. Three
factors affect the localization accuracy as the satellites' height
increases. First, the received power from each satellite decreases as 1/h2. Because the ACRB scales as 1/Es, the effect of the satellite height matches the ACRB scaling exactly. The
second factor is the increase in the number of observable satellites as h increases, which improves the accuracy. The third factor is a less adequate system topology (since all the
transmitters are located farther away from the target), which
degrades localization accuracy. The fact that the asymptotic performance scales as h2 shows that the received energy is the dominant factor, whereas the two other factors become
negligible for large heights.

negligible in practical scenarios, and that the TDOA accuracy approaches the RSS+TDOA accuracy.
Numerical results demonstrated the convergence of the actual performance to the theoretical prediction. We used these findings to study the performance expressions and to draw novel insights. In particular, we showed that the ACRB increases monotonically with the height and scales as h2 for large h. Thus, as long as we guarantee a sufficient coverage probability, a lower satellite-height will result in better localization accuracy for any number of satellites. We also showed that the vertical localization accuracy is typically lower than the horizontal accuracy and also more sensitive to the maximal receiver antenna angle, L,max; i.e., the vertical accuracy degrades much faster than the horizontal as the L,max decreases.
While the satellites are continually moving, the derived expressions depend on the network statistics and not on the specific locations. Thus, the presented closed-form-performance expressions are convenient and straightforward and can be used for a performance approximation that does not change over time. The derived expressions also provide insights on various network parameters (e.g., number of satellites, height, power), even if the actual deployment is yet unknown. Further research is necessary to better characterize the convergencerate and its dependency on the different parameters.

Combining the limits from Theorem 5, we can also produce an approximated formula, which is close to ACRB but much simpler:

AACRBz = z + zh2

(33)

Fig. 8 depicts the ACRB, (25), and AACRB, (32) and (33), as a function of h, corroborating the limits. Moreover, this simple expression is a reasonable approximation for all heights. The approximation maximum deviation from the
actual ACRB is by a factor of 2.2.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
We presented a new approach for analyzing TDOA and TDOA-RSS-based receiver localization via a satellite network. Assuming uniform distributed satellites on a sphere around the Earth, we used the Law of Large Numbers to calculate the localization-accuracy limiting-behavior. The resulting expressions depend solely on the network statistics and are not a function of a particular satellites locations. We also presented a simple condition proving that the RSS information is

Considering the uniform random satellite locations, each of J

entries is the sum of i.i.d. random variables. We thus employ

the Law of Large Numbers to evaluate the expectation with

respect to these locations. Explicitly, representing an entry of

J by [J]m,n =

we

use

[limN 

J N

=

E[bi].

Employing the Law of Total Expectation, we first condition

on all elevation angles, {L,i}, and then take the expectation

with respect to these angles. Accordingly, the expectation of

sums involving sin  or cos  is zero, whereas for sums with

sin2 

or

cos2 ,

it

equals

m = 3, 4, n = 7 - m (35) m = 4, n = 4 o.w.

Because E[J/N ] is a block diagonal matrix, the block corresponding to (x, y) in N · CRB is the same as though (z, T0)

9

were known; implying no coupling between (x, y) and (z, T0). From an estimation point of view, it means that knowing the unknowing (z, T0) does not affect the estimation accuracy of (x, y) under the regime in which CRB is asymptotically tight. We now calculate LCRBxy. From (35) it follows that

LCRBxy

(38)

where Dmax is given in (13). Substituting (1) and simplifying establishes the desired result, (11).
To derive LCRBz, we consider the inverse of the second block in (35), which yields

LCRBz = E[Li1L,i ] · E[Ki cos2 L,i1L,i ]E[Li1L,i ]

-E2[Li cos L,i1L,i ] -1.

APPENDIX B DECOUPLING OF a AND 

This appendix provides a proof for the following theorem: Theorem 6: Assuming the signal model (14), there is no coupling between the  estimation and the a estimation.
Proof: To prove the theorem we show that FIM crossentries are zero. That is, we need to prove that

where

To

the

we

differentiate (45) with respect to (w.r.t.) Am and then w.r.t. the

location or the time coordinate. The log likelihood derivative

w.r.t. Am is

(45)

Now, examining the cross entries corresponding to T0 and Am, the derivative of (45) w.r.t. T0 is

Noting that E[r~m(t)] = Ams(t - m(~)) and



s(t)s(t)dt = 0

(47)

it follows that

(48)

Next, to the cross entries corresponding to x and Am. The parameter x affects the likelihood via Dm. Since we use

10

TDOA while ignoring RSS, only m(~) is a function of Dm. Further deriving (45) w.r.t. x, we obtain (49), from which (50) follows:

2L(~) Amx

(50)

The proof for the cross elements corresponding to the y- and z-coordinates follow exactly the same reasoning as (49) and

(50).

APPENDIX C PROOF OF THEOREM 3

Following the same approach as in Appendix A, we have that

LCRBxy = E[[J]11/N ]-1 + E[[J]22/N ]-1

LCRBz = E[[J]33/N ]-1.

(51)

Using again, the Law of Total Expectation, we first consider the expectation of the FIM (17) w.r.t. to .

Finally, by transforming the polar angle back to L-coordinates using Equation (1), the desired result follows.
We now derive LCRBz. From (52) one obtains

LCRBz = E[Li1L,i ] · E[Li cos2 L,i1L,i ]E[Li]

-E2[Li cos L,i1L,i ] -1

(55)

We already evaluated all the expectations in (55) in the proof of Theorem 1, except of E[Li cos L,i1L,i ]. The latter is given by

E[Li cos L,i1L,i ]

= 2E[Di-3(R cos E,i - r)1E,i ]

APPENDIX D PROOF OF LEMMA 4

Comparing (17) to (8), it follows that

J = ~J + o(We).

(57)

From [44], Section 5.8, it follows that:

J-1 - J~-1 = o(We-2).

(58)

which leads to (22) and (23).
