## Abstract

This letter proposes two finite-time bearing-based control laws for acyclic leader-follower formations. The leaders in formation move with a bounded continuous reference velocity and each follower controls its position with regard to three agents in the formation. The first control law uses only bearing vectors, and finite-time convergence is achieved by properly selecting two state-dependent control gains. The second control law requires both bearing vectors and communications between agents. Each agent simultaneously localizes and follows a virtual target. Finite-time convergence of the desired formation under both control laws is proved by mathematical induction and supported by numerical simulations.
