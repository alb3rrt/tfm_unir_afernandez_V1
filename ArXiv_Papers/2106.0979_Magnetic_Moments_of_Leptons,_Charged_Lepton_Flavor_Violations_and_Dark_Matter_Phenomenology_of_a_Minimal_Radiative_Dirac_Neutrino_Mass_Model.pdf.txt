In a simple extension of the standard model (SM), a pair of vector like lepton doublets (L1 and L2) and a SU (2)L scalar doublet () have been introduced to help in accommodating the discrepancy in determination of the anomalous magnetic moments of the light leptons, namely, e and µ. Moreover, to make our scenario friendly to a Dirac like neutrino and also for a consistent dark matter phenomenology, we specifically add a singlet scalar (S) and a singlet fermion () in the set-up. A discrete symmetry Z2 × Z2 has been imposed under which all the SM particles are even while the new particles may be assumed to have odd charges. In a bottom-up approach, with a minimal particle content, we systematically explore the available parameter space in terms of couplings and masses of the new particles. Here a number of observables associated with the SM leptons have been considered, e.g., masses and mixings of neutrinos, (g - 2) anomalies of e, µ, charged lepton flavor violating (cLFV) observables and the dark matter (DM) phenomenology of a singlet-doublet dark matter. Neutrinos, promoted as the Dirac type states, acquire mass at one loop level after the discrete Z2 symmetry gets softly broken, while the unbroken Z2 keeps the dark matter stable. The mixing between the singlet  and the doublet vector lepton can be constrained to satisfy the electroweak precision observables and the spin independent (SI) direct detection (DD) cross section of the dark matter. In this analysis, potentially important LHC bounds have also been discussed.

2 I. INTRODUCTION

The standard model (SM) of particle physics has been quite successful in explaining the interactions of elementary particles [1]. The recent discovery of a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV at the Large Hadron Collider [2, 3] has been showing good agreements with the SM expectations [4, 5]. However, there exists a few experimental and theoretical issues, which cannot be explained in the SM paradigm, thus, hint towards a more complete theory -- beyond SM physics (BSM) at the TeV scale. Among these signatures, the precise measurement of the dark matter (DM) abundance and the non-zero values of the neutrino masses and mixings are of particular interests to us. Here, one may broadly recall the issues at hand. (i) Assuming the origin of the dark matter is related to a new kind of particle, the simplest and most compelling candidate has been considered as a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP). The experiments like PLANCK [6] and WMAP [7] have already provided precise measurements of DM relic density. WIMPs with masses  1 TeV can lead to the correct relic density through its annihilations to SM particles. Such a mass scale can be probed at the high-energy collider experiments like the LHC and also at the dark matter direct detection experiments. (ii) Non-zero neutrino masses and substantial mixing among the three light neutrino states require specific extensions of the SM. In the simplest case, one may introduce right handed neutrinos R and assumes a Dirac mass term mD for the neutrinos. But, then the neutrino Yukawa couplings are assumed to be 10-11 to generate a neutrino mass  0.1 eV. However, being a singlet under the SM gauge group, R can also accommodate a large Majorana mass parameter M which violates the lepton number by 2 units. Such a mass term leads to an attractive possibility -- called "seesaw mechanism" where the light neutrinos L obtain an effective small Majorana mass term [8­10]. The tinyness of neutrino masses can be explained naturally without requiring a tiny Yukawa coupling. Though seesaw mechanism is more favoured, experimentally, the searches to probe the Majorana nature of neutrinos through neutrinoless double beta decay experiments have not yet lead to any conclusive evidence. So the simple idea of considering neutrino as a Dirac particle has been still quite popular.

There have already been many proposals which may incorporate new particles and appropriate mixings,

thus, explains the masses for neutrinos and the dark matter abundance in the extensions of the SM.

However, it is more natural to consider that there exists a tie-up between these two important pieces which

may lead to a somewhat economical and an attractive extension of the SM to deal with. Driven by the

same pursuit, here we will also furnish a connection between these two important issues assuming neutrino

as a Dirac particle. Interestingly and more importantly, we will observe that the precision observables like

can

the experimental constraints related to the charged lepton flavor violations. The idea of neutrino as a Dirac particle has revived in the recent past when the main theoretical objection
of having a very tiny tree level Yukawa coupling has been addressed through the radiative generation of neutrino masses [11­23] (for a review see [24]). The main idea is simple and can be realized through an additional Z2 × Z2 symmetry in the SM set up : (1) one may assume a discrete symmetry (here Z2) to forbid a tree-level Dirac neutrino masses. This symmetry would be finally broken softly to generate a tiny neutrino mass through a radiative mechanism. (2) New fields may be introduced; in the simplest case, an inert scalar doublet (+ 0)T and neutral singlet fermions can be considered (see below) to radiatively induce neutrino masses in the loop. The new fields may transform odd under the another Z2 symmetry to prohibit their couplings with the other SM fermions, thus, offers an interesting possibility where the lightest state (a new Z2 odd fermion or a neutral scalar) may become the cold dark matter (CDM) of the universe. This class of models where neutrinos acquire masses through dark matter in the loop, thereby connects the two important BSM aspects of the particle physics has been dubbed as "scotogenic" model [25]. In the original idea, the neutrino masses have been assumed to be of Majorana type. However, one may employ the same idea to generate the masses for the neutrinos radiatively considering them as the Dirac particle, if a symmetry like global or gauge U (1) symmetry is assumed to prohibit the Majorana mass term in the Lagrangian [14].
Assuming the lepton number as a good symmetry of the Lagrangian at the backdrop of our work we start our discussion with a simple realization1. We consider new leptons/scalars at the electroweak (EW) scale in addition to the usual right handed neutrinos R: singlet Dirac fermion(s) (N ), two scalars -- an inert scalar doublet  and a real singlet scalar S in the particle content of the SM. A perturbative value of the coupling Y N¯R  (  e, µ,  ) may help to realize tiny nature of the neutrino Yukawa couplings radiatively, through an interacting Lagrangian. Additionally, other interaction terms YRN¯ SR and µ HS are also relevant to realize such a scenario. Here the last term µ can be regarded as the soft symmetry breaking parameter. As in the case of a "scotogenic" model, with proper charge assignments under Z2 ×Z2 symmetry, Dirac masses for the SM neutrinos, proportional to the soft breaking scale µ , would be generated radiatively through a N -  - S loop. Similarly, observable abundance of the dark matter N would follow naturally. However, this simple model fall short to account for the BSM contributions in the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of muon aµ [32], though can help to acclimatize the measurement of ae. Primarily, the non-SM contribution, controlled by the N - ± loop, comes out to be negative while the discrepancy in the muon anomalous magnetic moment aµ requires a positive boost, thus, disfavours this simple set-up
1 for some recent works, see [19, 26­31].

4
(for a generic discussion on the new physics contributions to aµ, see [33, 34]). We next consider the vector like (VL) leptons in place of singlet Dirac like state N in the SM set-
up, without changing the basic structure of the model. For a color singlet VL, left and right handed components transform similarly under the SM gauge symmetries, and one may observe that aµ can be accommodated through the mixings with the SM leptons [35­39]. However, addressing ae along with aµ invites a further modification. We, thus introduce a pair of SU (2) vector like leptons L1  (L01 L-1 )T , L2  (L02 L-2 )T with same hypercharge (but charged differently under Z2 × Z2 symmetry) which can be found to be suitable when coupled to new states; e.g., an inert Higgs doublet , a real singlet scalar S and a SM singlet fermion  in the present context. As in the previous case, S acts to realize the soft breaking of Z2 symmetry; thus to generate Dirac masses for the neutrinos while  has its role to realize the proper dark matter abundance. In fact, L1 and  can enjoy the same transformation properties under the Z2 × Z2 symmetry; thus the neutral L01 and  can mix to provide with a suitable candidate for dark matter (0) and to accommodate (g - 2)e anomaly through neutral fermions and charged scalars running in the loop. The charged components of the new leptons help to explain the other anomaly in (g - 2)µ. Naturally, neutrino mass as well as cLFV processes receive contributions from the diagrams that involve both of the VL leptons in the loops. In [38], authors find that a vector like lepton doublet in presence of a right handed neutrino and inert Higgs doublet may indeed be helpful in explaining (g - 2)µ deviation while the tiny Majorana masses for the neutrinos can also be generated in a "scotogenic" model. Here we will try to find if the both anomalous (g - 2)µ and (g - 2)e can be accommodated with the said particle contents while neutrinos acquire Dirac masses through dark matter 0 in the loop.
In dark matter phenomenology, singlet-doublet DM 0 comprised of L01 and singlet , could just be able to produce the correct relic abundance [40­48]. Admitting only VL doublet lepton L01, one finds a large DM-nucleon elastic cross-section through Z mediated processes, thus has essentially been ruled out by the experiments such as XENON1T [49] or LUX [50]. As a natural deviation, one finds that a singlet-doublet fermion dark matter, through its SM singlet component may escape the stringent direct detection bounds. For practical purposes, the dark matter particle has to be essentially dominated by the singlet component, while only a very small doublet part can be allowed. For the same reason, we purposefully introduce  in the particle content.
We organise our paper as follows. In sec II, we explain the details of our model including the new particles and their charges under the complete gauge group which would be considered. After electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), our model predicts additional neutral and charged leptons. Consequently, relevant interactions of the new particles with the SM particles can be realized. Theoretical and experimental

5
bounds on their couplings and masses have been summarized in III. These include (i) anomalous magnetic moments and different charged lepton flavor violating decays of the SM leptons, (ii) vacuum stability of the tree level scalar potential, (iii) Electroweak precision observables (EWPO) and (iv) collider physics constraints. In the results sections, we present radiative generation of the neutrino masses and mixing angles in sec IV. As discussed, one of the motivations is to show that our model can accommodate anomalous magnetic moments of the lighter charged leptons. We depict the parameter space of our model in sec V, where discrepancies in aµ/e can simultaneously be satisfied. Subsequently, we probe our model parameters with different charged lepton flavor violating (cLFV) observables, namely    and   3 . DM phenomenology including the relic density and the direct detection of a singlet-doublet fermionic DM have been covered in sec VI. Finally, we conclude this work in sec VII.

II. THE MODEL: RELEVANT LAGRANGIAN AND SCALAR POTENTIAL AT THE TREE LEVEL

As stated, the proposed model is a simple extension of the Standard Model where we augment two scalars, namely a real singlet (S) and a SU (2)L doublet   (+ 0)T , two vector like lepton doublets L1  (L01 L-1 )T , L2  (L02 L-2 )T , a singlet fermion  and the usual SM singlet right handed neutrinos R. All the new states are charged under an additional Z2 × Z2 symmetry (see Table I).
The allowed interactions of the new fields and the SM fields can be read from the following Lagrangian :

L = LSM + Lnew ,

(1)

where Lnew, the new physics Lagrangian is given by,

+ (µS)(µS) + (Dµ)(Dµ) - V (, H, S).

(2)

Here, Dµ is the SU (2)L × U (1)Y covariant derivative and V (, H, S) is the scalar potential. We define field ~ as i2. We are following the convention QEM = T3 + Y . For clarity, we refrain from explicit showing of SU (2) contractions. Except for the right handed neutrinos, single generation of all the other new states would suffice for our purpose (see Table I for details). Here we note that, L1 and L2 are assumed to have different charges under Z2 × Z2 symmetry. Interacting Lagrangian is realized through the new Yukawa couplings Y1 · · · Y6 where in the parenthesis, number of the fermion generations that are involved, are

6

presented. All the Yukawa couplings are assumed to be real. The new fermion states L1, L2,  and also the RH neutrino R have one unit of lepton number to preserve the lepton number conservation. Moreover, in this work, VLs can only couple to the SM leptons through the new scalar states which do not acquire any vacuum expectation values (VEV); thus the masses and mixings of the SM charged leptons would remain unaffected. In Eq. (2), the interaction between L1 and SM singlet  is felicitated through the SM Higgs H which drives the DM phenomenology.
Finally, we may express the scalar potential V (, H, S) in Eq. (2) which adheres the proposed symmetry as follows:

V (, H, S) = µ2H HH + µ2 + µ2SSS + H (HH)2 + ()2 + S(SS)2 + H ()(HH)

+

H (H)(H)

+

H 2

+

h.c]

+

+

S ( )(S  S ).

(3)

There can be a few additional terms like which are allowed by gauge and Lorentz invariance, but due to the imposed Z2 × Z2 symmetry these terms transform non-trivially and hence are forbidden (see e.g., last four terms in Table I(b)). This in turn ensures that the new scalars S,  do not acquire any induced VEV. As usual µ2H can take negative values. As stated, to generate the mass terms for the SM neutrinos, Z2 symmetry can be broken explicitly by introducing a soft breaking term at the scalar potential,

LSB = µ HS .

(4)

Since µ breaks the Z2, it may be argued to be very small, thus may be helpful in fitting neutrino masses. Before discussing the phenomenology, let us briefly outline the role of different discrete symmetries in
the present analysis. We assume Z2 to be an exact symmetry which always ensures that (i) a tree level Dirac like neutrino mass term, e.g., ¯H~  would be absent and (ii) 0, the singlet like admixture of L01 and , a state odd under Z2 may become stable to form the cold dark matter. On the other hand Z2 forbids the usual tree level Yukawa interaction ¯H~ R, but it needs to be broken softly to generate neutrino masses through radiative corrections. Additionally, there are a few other couplings among the new fields and the SM fields which fail to qualify as the valid interactions. For a better understanding, we list them in Table I along with their transformations under the proposed symmetry group. Here  and × refer to the occasions when a particular interaction term turns out to be even or odd under a symmetry operation respectively.
Mixings and couplings of the VL states with bosons and fermions: As can be seen from Eq. (2) that lepton phenomenology is primarily governed by the new Yukawa couplings Yi(i = 1...6). Apparently, the first four couplings are more important for the phenomenology in the lepton sector, while Y5 primarily

controls the DM physics. The Yukawa interactions involving the singlet states may contribute to neutrino masses and also the dark matter relic abundance. For a generic study, we keep all the couplings with Yi(i = 1...6) in the flavor space.
Let us first start our discussion with the interactions mediated by Y5 in Eq. (2). The Yukawa interaction, Y5L¯1H~  generates a mass matrix,

The mixing angle is defined as,

(11)

If we assume a small mixing angle i.e.,  << 1 then 1 is dominantly doublet-like with a small admixture

of singlet , while 0 is mostly singlet-like. Since the direct detection experiments require DM to be mostly

singlet dominated, we can propose 0 as the DM candidate with the condition that M0 < M1, which is

further ensured by the choice M < ML1. The Yukawa coupling Y5, now being a dependent parameter,

can be expressed in terms of M1, M0 and  through the following relation,

Y5

(12)

At this point we can recast the Yukawa terms in Eq. (2) in this new basis of (0, 1) as:

III. BOUNDS RELATED TO DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS AND THEORIES
Here we review different bounds related to experimental searches and theories. We will use the limits in delineating the parameter space consistent with the anomalous magnetic moments of leptons, charged lepton flavor violations and the dark matter abundance.

A. Anomalous magnetic moment and different LFV decays

Bounds on anomalous magnetic moment: From the first precision measurement of the magnetic dipole moment of the muon aµ at BNL (Brookhaven National Laboratory), the persistent discrepancy in its determination compared to its SM prediction has been undoubtedly one of the most promising hints towards a new physics signal at the TeV scale. The discrepancy can be expressed through its experimental measurements ( aeµxp) and the SM prediction ( aSµM ). The difference in the two values can be seen to be driven by the BSM contributions ( aµ). For the last many years, the experimental data produced a roughly 3.7 deviation [51­53] from the standard model (SM) value, aµ = (27.06 ± 7.26) × 10-10. For a better understanding of the known physics, it was imperative to resolve the tension related to the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) of aSµM . The tension lies in the fact that a recent latticeQCD [54] estimation of the HVP may bring the SM prediction of aµ into agreement with experiments which seems to be in contradiction with e+e-  hadrons cross section data and global fits to electroweak precision observables [55]. The Fermilab-based Muon g-2 experiment has just reported a new result which, if combined with the BNL result reads [56] 4.2 deviation from the SM value2.

aµ = (25.1 ± 5.9) × 10-10.

(15)

Thus, as stated earlier, from Eq. (15) it is clearly visible that one needs a positive BSM contribution to satisfy the experimental constraint on aµ. In the context of ae, the experimental value has been updated in 2018 [70] from a precision measurement of the fine-structure constant [71]. This measurement also shows a possible disagreement between the experimental observation and theory prediction, though with a less significance  3.

ae = -(8.7 ± 3.6) × 10-13.

(16)

More importantly, here the measured value is lower than the corresponding SM prediction. Following the improved estimates, specially in the evaluation of ae, attempts have been made to link the both discrepancies with a common new physics origin [72­85].
2 Recent measurement at the Fermilab has drawn some interests to our community [57­69].

10
Bounds on charged lepton flavor violating decays: Charged lepton flavor violating processes, specifically    or   3  through photon penguins may be influenced by the same dipole operators which provides the BSM contributions to aµ/e. Non observations of any cLFV processes so far, can potentially constrain the new physics parameters. Currently, the radiative decay of   , specifically µ  e, is the leading candidate among the cLFV observables to put a stringent constraint on the parameter space. In the future upgrades, the MEG collaboration can reach a sensitivity of about 6 × 10-14 after 3 years of acquisition time [86]. Similarly, in the near future, µ  3e can be probed by the Mu3e experiment [87, 88] with a branching ratio sensitivity of 10-16. A significant improvement is expected compared to the present limit, set by the SINDRUM experiment [89]. An impressive improvement on most of the LFV modes of the rare  decays can be expected from searches in B factories [90, 91]. Table II includes the present and future sensitivities of the important cLFV processes which would be considered in this work.

Current Experimental bounds and future sensitivities for the LFV processes.
B. Condition of Vacuum stability and the masses of scalars
The scalar potential must be bounded from below i.e., it does not acquire negative infinite value in any of the field directions for large field values. This physical requirement puts certain constraints on the scalar

11

couplings. Considering the tree level scalar potential, these conditions are listed below [95].

H , , S > 0 ,

H + 2 H > 0 ,

H + H - H + 2 H > 0 ,

HS + 2 H S > 0 ,

S + 2 S > 0.

(17)

After the electroweak symmetry breaking only H field gets a VEV, v 246 GeV. Thus, scalar fields can be expressed as :

We identify h as our SM like Higgs scalar with mass Mh 125 GeV. Again for simplicity we assume that the new scalars are heavier to forbid the constraints coming from the invisible Z and h decays. Similarly the mass splitting between the charged and the neutral components of the doublet  are considered to be negligible, i.e., MA = M0 = M±  M. This is indeed possible (see Eq. (19)), if the couplings H and H can be assumed to be very small. In fact, H is absent under a global or gauge U (1) symmetry. However, such a mass splitting may play a significant role for its discovery at the LHC (see e.g., [96]).

C. Electroweak precision observables (EWPO)
In the presence of two BSM scalars (, S), two vector like lepton doublets (L1, L2) and a singlet fermion (), our model may introduce corrections to the gauge boson vacuum polarization amplitudes or electroweak precision observables (EWPO). These observables were initially discussed by Peskin and

12

Takeuchi as S, T and U parameters in Ref. [97]. Later Barbieri et al. introduced S^, T^, W , Y [98] as the

most general parameterization of the new physics effects. S^ and T^ are related to the original S and T

parameters through the simple relations:

S^ =

S 4s2W

and T^ = T , where  is the fine structure constant

and sW = sin W . Among the generalized Peskin-Takeuchi parameters, W and Y are important at LEP2

energy scale [98, 99], thus will not be considered here. Usually for any generic model, one can find from

the global analysis that the electroweak precision parameters are much smaller (at the level of 10-3) and

this does not depend on the mass of the Higgs scalar. Our calculations of the precision observables are

based upon Refs. [99, 100].

The current experimental constraints are [53, 98],

S^ = (0.0 ± 1.3) × 10-3 ,

(20)

T^ = (0.1 ± 0.9) × 10-3 .

(21)

Inert doublet  may particularly effect T or T^ parameter through H and H [100]. But in the limit, MA = M0 = M±  M, which we assume in the subsequent analysis, the electroweak parameters seem to be unaffected by the presence of new scalars. Hence the correction is completely due to the effect of vector like fermions (VLF), i.e., in our model (S^, T^) = (S^, T^)V LF . Therefore, the correction in T^ parameter appearing due to the mixing between L1 and  for q2  0 limit can be expressed as [99],

T^

~ (ML1 , ML1 , 0) + cos4  ~ (M1 , M1 , 0) + sin4  ~ (M0 , M0 , 0)

+ 2 sin2  cos2  ~ (M0, M1, 0) - 2 cos2  ~ (ML1, M1, 0) - 2 sin2  ~ (ML1, M0, 0) , (22)

where ML1 is the mass term for L-1 , g is the SU (2)L coupling constant,  is the mixing angle between L01

and  as discussed earlier, MW stands for the mass of W boson and

One can easily see that for ma = mb, Eq. (23) vanishes. Hence Eq. (22) simplifies to

(24)

It can be noted that the divergent part of the first term of Eq. (24) is cancelled by the divergences
encapsulated in the last two terms. Moreover in the limit, when the mass splitting between ML1 and M1 vanishes, (i.e., sin   0) one finds T^  0. In our model, the correction in S^ can be parameterized as,

S^

It can be directly verified that the divergent parts along with the scaling factor µ get cancelled when

Eq. (26) or Eq. (27) is substituted in Eq. (25).

Numerically, since the oblique parameters are sensitive to the mass splitting M = (M1 - ML1), we depict its variation with M1 in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b) for three different values of sin  = 0.01, 0.1 and 0.3 keeping DM mass M0 = 100 GeV. Clearly, electroweak precision constraints on S^ is much relaxed compared to the oblique parameter T^ to the new fermions. For moderate or smaller values of 1 mass, one finds that M  O(20) GeV is allowed by the oblique parameter T^, which sets an upper bound on sin  ( 0.1).
The bounds can be used to constrain the bare masses of the new fermions. For example, one may always cast the bare masses ML1 and M in terms of M0, M1 and mixing angle .

FIG. 1. Constraints on M = (M1 - ML1 ) coming from the EWPO (a) T^ and (b) S^ with respective to M1 for three different values of sin  = 0.01, 0.1 and 0.3 when both M1 and ML1 are varied randomly. Here M0 = 100 GeV is assumed. (c) and (d) shows the variation of M as a function of M0 , when M1 = 800 GeV and ML1 is given by Eq. (28).
Notably, the change in M is negligible to the variation with M0 for a small mixing angle (sin   0.1) (see Fig. 1(c) and (d)). In other words, the EWPOs are insensitive to the lightest neutral fermion mass M0 as long as the mixing angle is not much high. In the subsequent section, we consider sin   0.01, thus, in this regime, the mass of the charged component of the VL, ML1 can easily be fixed through M1 while satisfying all the bounds coming from EWPOs.

D. Constraints from the collider observables
For vector like quarks, the LHC pair production cross section is determined from QCD, so model independent bounds can be placed in the parameter space. However, for the vector like leptons, the pair-

15

production cross section is mediated by the s-channel electroweak vector boson exchanges, thus depends

on the respective SU (2)L and U (1)Y couplings of the new states. As the cross section would reside on the

lower side, much weaker bounds can be expected. There are several searches by the LHC collaborations 
[102­104] at s = 8 and 13 TeV run at the LHC. As expected, the constraint is much more stringent

for a pure SU (2)L VL pair that mixes with and decays to SM leptons. For example, heavy lepton mass

values in the range 114 - 176 GeV are excluded through decay into Z boson and e, µ. In some recent

analysis, the CMS collaboration has published [103, 104] the results of dedicated searches for doublet-like

VLs,

 lepton in the mass range of 130 - 690 GeV or 120 <  < 790 GeV following its decays to tau leptons.

The mass of the VL is the only free parameter both in the production cross section and in the branching

fraction calculations, thus in the estimation of the bound. In a recent analysis [105], using a CMS search

based on 77.4 f b-1 at 13 TeV LHC a bound on doublet-like vector leptons has been presented ( 800

GeV) mainly focusing on 4 final states. Unlike most of the studies presented above, in this model, direct

couplings of L1, L2 with SM leptons are not allowed; so the direct limits cannot be placed. Rather, one

may consider two realistic situations through electroweak productions of VL states where (i) the inert

doublet  can be lighter or (ii) heavier than L1 and L2. Here 0 and S are assumed to be the lightest states with MS > M0. In the first case, one expects pp  W ±(Z)  L±1 1(L±1 L1 , 11)  n + E/T or pp  W ±(Z)  L±2 L02(L±2 L2 , L02L02)  n + E/T (  e, µ) where n stands for two or more leptons in the final states. For M  M1, one may expect for the same final states through three body decays of L1 or L2 via off-shell . Qualitatively, similar situations through the pair production of electroweakinos can be

realized in the context of supersymmetry, and thus a stringent bound can be placed [106­110]. However, to

obtain a realistic bound on the parameter space, (i) branching ratio (BR) of the decaying particle and (ii)

mass splitting between different charged and neutral components of electroweakinos have to be computed.

In fact for smaller BR and for smaller mass difference (known as compressed spectra in the literature),

much lighter electroweakinos are still allowed [111­113]. In the present context, mass splitting between

the new fermions and scalars, i.e., L±1,2(1) - ±,0 can be appropriately tuned without affecting the lepton phenomenology, which we are interested in. But for the sake of completeness we consider lighter and

heavier  with respect to vector leptons, though M  ML1,2 can easily be achieved. A dedicated study in this front is beyond the scope of this paper. In this work, we refrain from using the LHC limits at the

first place to disallow a parameter space point, though we restrict to a parameter space where L1, L2 are

heavier than 500 GeV.

In our model,  couples to leptons, so can only be produced through electroweak gauge bosons at

16
the LHC. Also, recall that  does not acquire any VEV, thus do not take part in electroweak symmetry breaking. In a model specific study, one would expect dilepton +E/T [96, 114] through charged  pair production, or mono-lepton + E/T through charged and neutral  productions via Z boson or W boson exchanges. An observable signal may be expected during high luminosity run of LHC through multilepton searches for M  250 GeV [96]. Here, assuming all the charged and neutral components of  are of similar masses, we consider M > 100 GeV which is closely based on the exclusions at LEP [115]. However, our result does not depend much on M.

.

As discussed, here neutrinos are massless at the tree level due to the imposed Z2 × Z2 symmetry while they may receive appropriate radiative corrections through the symmetry breaking term in Eq. (4). Thus one may develop a Dirac mass term for the SM neutrinos at one loop order after the Higgs field acquires a VEV. Additionally, the neutrino loops contain a stable particle 0 that could be treated as the cold DM of the universe [see Fig. 2(b)]. This intrinsically sets up a bridge between the phenomenology of light neutrinos and the other sectors like dark matter. The (3 × 3) neutrino mass matrix can be read as:

and

respectively which can be read as yf = (Y3, -Y4sin, Y4cos) and zf = (Y2, -Y6sin, Y6cos). Just as a

M ij = UP MNS(diag[mi])UP MNS;

in which sij  sin ij, cij  cos ij;  is the Dirac CP violating phase, and 21,31 are Majorana CP violating phases. Note that, using the global fit based on the current neutrino data, one may compute |Mij| in terms of the different mass hierarchies, namely, normal hierarchy m232 > 0 (NH) and inverted hierarchy m232 < 0 (IH) as [116] (m2ij  m2i -m2j ). Taking m1(3) = 0 for NH (IH), and zero values for the Majorana phases (21(31) = 0) and the 3 uncertainties, the magnitudes of the neutrino mass matrix elements in units of eV for NH and IH can be estimated as:

 O(1) TeV, one may find that f O(10-2 - 10-3) eV. Thus, the involved Yukawa couplings may take O(1) values to produce the correct values of the neutrino mass matrix as obtained in Eq. (34). Interestingly, out of the four Yukawas, only Y3(i1) and Y4(i1) (i  1...3) appear in most of the low energy phenomenology which are of interest to us. This includes neutrino masses and their mixings, precision observables like the anomalous magnetic moment of leptons or the cLFV processes and also the DM phenomenology. On the other hand, the other two Yukawa couplings Y2(1i) and Y6(1i) (six in total) related to the singlet state Ri can control the neutrino masses and mixings. Thus, one may always use the freedom of choosing the free parameters Y2 and Y6 to satisfy the observed mass square differences and mixing angles while Y3 and Y4 can be kept completely free to satisfy the observables related to low energy lepton phenomenology.

V. LEPTON g - 2, CLFV PROCESSES AND OTHER CONSTRAINTS

In the lepton phenomenology, apart from tuning the µ and e anomaly, new scalars , S, charged fermions L±2 , L±1 and neutral leptons 1 and 0 may lead to observable signatures to lepton flavor violating processes such as   , or   3  through the Yukawa couplings Y1, Y3 and Y4 that tie the SM leptons to BSM particles. The free parameters can be listed as:

M1 , M0 , MS, M, ML2 , Y1(1i), Y3(i1), Y4(i1) (i  e, µ,  ), sin  .

(35)

19

The other charged lepton mass ML1 can be expressed in terms of M0, M1 and  via Eq. (28). Unless otherwise stated, the mixing parameter in the neutral lepton sector sin  = 0.01 is being fixed in our analysis. For the sake of clarity, we recast the new Yukawa couplings of Eq. (2) (and hence Eq. (35)) as Yij where i assumes different types of the couplings e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and j takes the different flavors e, µ,  . As an example, Y1(1e) in the Eq. (2) is simply denoted as Y1e. In this set-up i.e., with the minimal contents of new states, first we survey if the discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental values of the magnetic moments of muon and electron can be explained. Then we will consider the charged lepton flavor violating processes. All the radiatively induced processes could be tested in the present and future generation of experiments; thus a domain for flavor specific Yukawa couplings can be derived.

In the above, sin2   0 has been taken for illustration. Additionally, we consider that all the couplings

are real and positive. In Eq. (40), the first two terms arise from the diagram with a charged fermion and

a neutral scalar in the loop. The third term involves a neutral fermion and a charged scalar in the loop.

Here the DM state 0 may provide with a positive contribution in aµ, owing to the mixing between L01 and . The negative parts in a (see Eq. (41)) involves only a neutral fermion and a charged scalar in

the loop which is shown in Fig. 3(a). Thus, considering the opposite signs of aµ and ae in mind, one

can easily expect that aµ should have a major contribution from Eq. (40) while Eq. (41) may play the

dominant role in determining ae. In terms of the controlling parameters, aµ (ae) are managed by a set

of new coupling parameters Y4 , Y3 , Y1 (  e, µ) and also by the masses of new scalars and mixing of the neutral leptons. Electroweak precision observables restrict the mixing in the neutral leptons : cos   1,

and, thus, ML1 M1 may be used for illustration (see Eq. (28)). For the scalar mass parameters, MS is kept fixed at 110 GeV, while M = 400 and 1200 GeV are considered. As stated earlier, ML1,2  500 GeV has been always considered. Keeping this in mind, the variation of the flavor dependent couplings Yiµ or

Yie (i  1, 3, 4) with the mass of new scalars or fermions have been depicted through scattered plots where

points consistent with ai (i  e, µ) within the 2 allowance in Eq. (15) and Eq. (16) are only shown.

We begin our discussion with µ-specific couplings Yiµ and the relevant mass parameters MS, M, ML2 to probe their limits in controlling aµ. Here the role of Y4µ is somewhat tricky and depends on the choice of other parameters. For example, it can provide an unhelpful contribution through Eq. (44). Similarly, unless Y1µ Y4µ, Eq. (45) dominates over the aYµ4µ. However, the contribution in Eq. (45) can take both positive and negative values which can be controlled by the ratio M0/M1. Truly, a specific ratio of the neutral fermions, i.e., M0/M1 can boost aµ through an overall positive contribution, driven by Y4µ. However, at the same time it becomes unfriendly to obtain a correct ae (since the same bracketed term in Eq. (45) potentially contributes to e magnetic moment). For a practical choice, we set Y4µ = 0 as we will see that aeY4eY1e term would have to be properly tuned to fit ae. In other words, M0/M1 will be chosen to have a negative contribution from aYe4eY1e to have a consistent ae.
Thus assuming Y4µ = 0, one finds aµ = aYµ3µ + aYµ1µ. A prominent cancellation between the

22
two terms in aµY1µ can always be observed irrespective of the value of Y1µ, and, thus, one finds aµ aYµ3µ. Thus, naturally, we may choose Y1µ at any value within its perturbative limit while satisfying the experimental bounds on aµ. We will see that a smaller Y1µ (which will be chosen in the subsequent analysis) would be highly desired to satisfy µ  e constraint.
Fig. 4(a) shows the variation of Y3µ as a function of ML2 when MS = 110 GeV, M = 400 GeV and M = 1200 GeV. The other input parameters are M1 = 800 GeV, M0 = 100 GeV, Y1µ = 10-4 while Y4µ is fixed at zero. Clearly, the doublet scalar does not have any influence to the result. As said earlier, only L2 - S loop can manage to attune aµ, and thus, one requires somewhat larger values for Y3µ. This can be further verified through Fig. 4(a). Note that, here mass of the singlet MS needs to be smaller to make Y3µ within the perturbative bound, and this can only be realized if our model considers light dark matter (since M0 < MS needs to be satisfied). However, a heavier 0 can also accommodate aµ without having any difficulties. Recall that setting Y4µ = 0 will automatically make vanishing contributions from Eqs. (44) and (45), which include M0. Thus, because of the choice of our parameters, 0 can affect aµ only through Eq. (43), which can only lead to insignificant contribution. A further confirmation can be made through Fig. 4(b), where we show variations of aµ as a function of M0 for M = 400 GeV and MS = 110 GeV. Neutral and charged vector leptons are fixed at masses M1 = 800 and ML2 = 500 GeV. Here we varied the couplings (Y1µ : [0.0001 - 1], Y3µ : [0.0001 - 10]) and M0 randomly. The resultant aµ can be seen to be consistent over the entire 0 range.
In our next precision calculation, we will now see the role of different parameters in obtaining a correct value for ae. Note that, here, for practical purposes, one finds ae aYe4(e)Y1(e). The reasons are as follows. aeY1(e) becomes insignificant due to cancellation between different terms. Moreover, aeY1(e) and aYe4(e) are  m2e, thus, are much suppressed and can be neglected for the parameter space, we are interested in. Additionally, we choose Y3e = 0 to forbid the positive part in Eq. (42). So we may re-express ae as follows:

(Y1e)(Y4e) 162

M1 F1

M21 M2

- M0 F1

As before, in the numerical analysis, we fixed MS = 110 GeV, M = 400 and 1200 GeV, ML2 = 500 GeV and M0 = 100 GeV. Fig. 5(a) depicts the variation of Y1e as a function of M1, when Y4e is fixed at 0.2. And similarly for the Fig. 5(b), where Y4e appears as the variable and Y1e is fixed at 0.2. In both of these plots red and green dots represent the scenarios corresponding to M = 400 GeV and 1200 GeV respectively. Note that, for the smaller values of M1, there is a difference between the allowed regions

corresponding to M = 400 GeV and 1200 GeV, while at the higher values both the red and green dots

merge [see Fig. 5(a) and (b)]. In the lighter 1 regime, where M1  M0, a partial cancellation in the

bracketed part of Eq. (46) can be observed. The suppression is more for a heavier , thus, a larger coupling

can be helpful to tune ae. On the other hand, for larger values of M1, the term M1F1

M21 M2

may

appear to have the leading contribution. At this large M1 region, for a fixed value of M1, F1

M21 M2

increases with the increasing value of M.

However, the overall term

1 M2

F1

M21 M2

becomes somewhat

insensitive to the variation in M.

Fig. 5(c) shows the scaled variation of ae as a function of M0/M1. All the other masses and couplings are fixed as before. The grey patch represents the 2 range of the ae. One can easily see that, a small mass ratio (< 0.25, < 0.75) for M = 1200, 400 GeV respectively, can lead to the desired negative

24
contribution. For larger M, to compensate the suppression, a lighter 0 is desired to produce the correct value for ae. On the other hand, with increasing M0/M1 the positive contribution starts to increase for a fixed M [see Eq. (46)] and hence a correct value of ae would be difficult to obtain.
As a final remark, it is now evident that the presence of the two VL states L1 and L2 are necessary to accommodate the both aµ and ae. The second doublet L2 may provide the sole contribution to muon magnetic moment, while the other one can be used to tune the magnitude and sign of the e magnetic moment. Moreover, we will find that, satisfying different cLFV processes may become much easier in this scenario.

B. cLFV constraints
In this model framework, in computing the cLFV observables we closely follow Refs. [117, 118]. Oneloop effective vertices, relevant for the different two and three body processes    or   3  are generated through the interactions among BSM fermions (a, L±a ), scalars  and S and the SM leptons.

1.   

We start with the effective interactions relevant for   . The details of the calculation are presented in Appendix C. Here we recast the form factors A2(n)L,R and A(2c)L,R related to neutral and charged fermions in terms of our model parameters respectively.

The generic functional forms for these D0 and D~0 are again available at Appendix B. Though only the dominant terms are mentioned, for numerical purposes, we calculated all BiL,R [i = 1, 2, 3, 4]. Finally, there may be Higgs penguin diagrams as well, but the Higgs couplings to the SM leptons are much suppressed ( O( 10-2)) compared to that of  and Z, and hence we can ignore them3.
3. Numerical Results
Here, we will particularly identify the allowed regions of parameter space associated with free parameters and masses as introduced in Eq. (35), in regard to different cLFV decays. Some of the free parameters, as already tuned by ai (i  e, µ), collider or the electroweak precision searches would be set within their allowed domains. In Figs. 9 and 10, the variation of branching ratios for the different cLFV processes with respect to the relevant couplings have been shown for M = 400 GeV and 1200 GeV respectively. We have followed a particular color code for all these plots, i.e., the red signifies Br(   ) while blue stands for Br(   3 ). The horizontal lines specify the present experimental bounds [see Table II] on the respective cLFV processes as indicated by the color code.
For the numerical set-up we have fixed,
· Scalar masses: M = 400 GeV and 1200 GeV, MS = 110 GeV. Here, Fig. 9 considers M = 400 GeV and Fig. 10 assumes M = 1200 GeV.
· Vector lepton masses and mixings: M1 = 800 GeV, ML2 = 500 GeV, M0 = 100 GeV, and sin  = 0.01.
· µ-specific flavor dependent couplings: Y4µ = 0.0 and Y3µ = 5.0.
· e-specific flavor dependent couplings: Y1e = 0.2, Y4e = 0.2 and Y3e = 0.0.
So, at this point, we are left with only four flavor specific free parameters, i.e., Y1µ, Y1 , Y3 and Y4 . Our aim would be to constrain these free couplings using the present and future limits of the cLFV branching ratios for    and   3  processes (where ,  = e, µ,  ). Thus, we have varied the free couplings randomly, and calculated the corresponding values for Br(   ) and Br(   3 ). Focusing on a particular flavor at a time, in the following, we present the possible 2-body and 3-body decays.
3 In some specific models, Higgs penguin may lead to significant contributions [122­124].

the precision measurements of µ and e anomalous magnetic moments. As can be evident from the plot, for Y1µ  10-4 both the Br(µ  e) and Br(µ  3e) can be made satisfied. This explains our choice for Y1µ in the earlier (g - 2)µ analysis. Thus, to have a simultaneous validation of the (g - 2)µ

31

and cLFV constraints (i.e. Br(µ  e) and Br(µ  3e)) one certainly needs a much smaller value of Y1µ ( 10-4).

· Br(  µ) and Br(  3µ) : The second rows of Figs. 9 and 10 correspond to these processes. All the µ specific couplings are already fixed: Y3µ and Y4µ have been set to their earlier values and Y1µ = 10-4 is considered (in accordance with Figs. 9(a) and 10(a)). Thus we have varied the  specific free parameters Yj (j = 1, 4, 3) and calculated the branching ratios. The allowed ranges of these couplings where Br(  µ) and Br(  3µ) are satisfied, can be seen from Figs. 9 (b), (c), (d) and 10 (b), (c), (d) respectively. Clearly, only meaningful constraint can be derived for Y3 which reads as Y3  0.01. The bound can be placed using Br(  3µ) which seems to be much stringent compared to Br(  µ). This is a result of the Z-penguin dominance in that region of the parameter space.

To illustrate it further, we focus on the dominant parts of  penguin contributions. In case of

photon initiated 2-body Br(   ), or 3-body Br(   3 ) decays, dipole terms become more

important, and specially the most significant parts read as:

The other terms related to dipole or monopole terms are proportional to the products of the other

flavor specific couplings Y1Y1, Y4Y4, Y3Y3. However, generically, considering the couplings for any ,  are of the same size, these terms are few orders of magnitude smaller compared to A(2n). For  - µ cLFV processes, A(2n)  sin  cos (Y1µY4 + Y1 Y4µ), thus extremely suppressed, unless Y4 is reasonably large. This suppression can be attributed to the tinyness of sin  and our choice of Yukawa couplings. In fact A(2n) may become large if Y4 is reasonably large or moderate. This can be verified from Figs. 9 (c) and 10 (c) where a crossover can be observed for Y4  0.03. Notably,

this value does not depend much on our choices of M. For higher values of the Y4 coupling, dipole

terms dominate in both Br(  µ) and Br(  3µ) processes; thus, naturally, 2-body decay of  becomes the more sensitive cLFV constraint. For Y4 < 0.03, the dominant parts in A(2n) are too low. Here, the other contributions from A(2n,1,c) become important for the 2-body and the 3-body processes. Similarly, for the later decays, the Z-penguin diagrams may become more important or

comparable to the  initiated ones. For illustration, we choose a particular set of  -specific couplings

as mentioned in the captions of Figs. 9 and 10. For example, in Figs. 9 (b), (d) and 10 (b), (d),

Y4 = 0, 0.01 have been chosen respectively, thus,  penguin is always suppressed which results in the dominance of Br(  3µ) over Br(  µ). We may note here that, in the µ - e processes the choice of parameters (particularly Y4µ = Y3e = 0 and Y1µ = 10-4) makes the 3-body BR always suppressed in comparison to that of 2-body (see the first row of the Figs. 9 and 10).
· Br(  e) and Br(  3e) : Third rows of Figs. 9 and 10 show the plots for these two processes. Here the only free parameters are Yj (j = 1, 4, 3), as the electronic couplings are fixed by the (g -2)e results. Indeed, the  specific parameters are same as in the   µ analysis. The ranges of Yj couplings where Br(  e) and Br(  3e) can be simultaneously satisfied, have been shown in Figs. 9 (e), (f) and (g) and 10 (e), (f) and (g) respectively. Similar to the  - µ processes, here the dipole term A(2n)  sin  cos (Y1eY4 + Y1 Y4e). But due to our choice of Y1e = Y4e = 0.2, A(2n) or consequently the Br(  e) is symmetric in Y1 and Y4 -- which is clearly visible from Figs. 9 (e), (f) and 10 (e), (f) [see the red lines]. On the other hand, there is a sharp difference between the variations of Br(  3e) with respect to Y1 and Y4 [see the blue lines]. But this asymmetry can be readily explained from Eqs. 53-55, since the Z-penguin (which is asymmetric in Y1 and Y4 ) appears as the most dominant contributor to the 3-body branching ratio in this region of parameter space. Moreover, here, Br(  e) or the dominant dipole contributions in the 3-body decays are much suppressed, specifically for our choice of sin  = 0.01. However, sin  independent terms and the non negligible values for the relevant Yukawa parameters lead to a large Z-penguin contribution to 3-body decays Br(  3e). From these plots (Figs. 9 (e), (f) and 10 (e), (f)), we are able to constrain the two  -specific couplings as: Y1  0.5 and Y4  0.03. Note that, the variation of BRs with respect to Y3 has been appearing as two horizontal lines, implying that the BRs are apparently independent of this coupling. This result is a sole outcome of the choice Y3e = 0. Since in both Br(  e) and Br(  3e), the coupling structure appears as Y3eY3 , putting Y3e = 0 automatically ensures the invariance of the BRs with respect to Y3 .
So finally, collecting all the constraints, i.e., from the anomalous magnetic moment data and non observation of the cLFV processes, we find that all the flavor specific couplings Y1,3,4 may assume  O(1 - 10-4) values, some of which may be tested in the near future.
VI. DARK MATTER PHENOMENOLOGY
This model may offer a singlet-doublet dark matter; phenomenology of such scenarios have been studied in detail [40­48]. Here we would simply check that if all the couplings which are already constrained by

33

the different precision and collider bounds, can provide us with an acceptable DM relic density, consistent

with SI DM-nucleon elastic cross section bounds. After EWSB, 0 -- a dominantly singlet-like state, odd under Z2 × Z2 symmetry can be considered to be the lightest particle -- thus a valid DM candidate while the other neutral state 1 carries a strong doublet-like nature for a small mixing angle . In general,

the singlet-doublet mixing parameter  is completely controlled by the SI direct detection bounds (much

stronger than the EWPO constraints); usually, only a very tiny  is allowed. We have fixed all other BSM particles (L±1 , L±2 ,0, , S) at a heavier mass scale, discussed as in our previous exercises. Since a small M0 is preferred from cLFV and a , we may focus on the parameter space with a light DM.

The relic abundance of DM in the universe as obtained from the PLANCK data is DM h2 = 0.1198 ±

0.0012 [125]. The singlet-like fermionic DM 0, being the lightest odd particle and stable under the imposed Z2 × Z2 symmetry, was in thermal equilibrium in the early universe through its interaction with the SM particles. But at a point of time (or temperature: T  Tfreeze out) it gets decoupled from the thermal bath when the interaction rate fell shorter than the expansion rate of the universe. The relic density of the DM

can be obtained by solving the Boltzmann equation, given by,

dn dt

=

-

n2eq)

(63)

where H is the Hubble constant, eff v is the thermal averaged cross section of the DM annihilating to

the SM particles and n signifies the number of interacting particles, with the subscript `eq' designating its

equilibrium value. Though, for doing the numerical analysis we have used micrOMEGAs [126, 127]. After

implementing the model parameters in LanHEP [128], the output files have been used as the input for

micrOMEGAs, to solve the Boltzmann equation numerically and for calculating the relic density. Here,

the mass parameters have been fixed at the same values as was done in Sec. V, with M assuming the

lower value, i.e. 400 GeV. For the flavor dependent Yukawa couplings, which are restricted by the cLFV

and (g - 2) bounds, we choose them at the following values:

Y1e Y3e Y4e Y1µ Y3µ Y4µ Y1 Y3 Y4 0.2 0.0 0.2 10-4 5.0 0.0 0.1 0.01 0.01
TABLE IV. Values (allowed by the cLFV and (g - 2) bounds) for flavor dependent Yukawa couplings used in the analysis of DM phenomenology.
The other meaningful coupling for DM phenomenology is Y6(1i) -- the interaction between DM, singlet scalar S and the right handed neutrinos Ri. Here, for simplicity, we are assuming Y6(1i) to be flavor

34

independent, i.e., Y6(1i)  Y6. The same coupling controls the calculation of neutrino masses [see Sec. IV]. Here we set Y6  O(10-1) without affecting the neutrino masses and mixings.

FIG. 11. The most dominant annihilation channel contributing to the relic density. This is particularly true when the other input parameters are fixed at the values shown in Table IV.
In this model, there may be a number of annihilation channels which can contribute to the relic density calculation. The order of dominance of these channels changes with the choice of the other input parameters. Here, Fig. 11 shows the most dominant annihilation channel for the chosen parameter space. It can be readily understood that the coupling Y6 plays a crucial role here in satisfying the observed cosmological data. We have listed the annihilation channels at M0 = 100 and 500 GeV in Table V, with Y6 = 0.3, 0.5 to obtain the correct relic density.

the calculated relic density in this model as one varies M0. Though from the earlier results of (g - 2)

and cLFV, M0  100 GeV seems to be somewhat preferred for the DM analysis, but for the sake of

completeness, we vary DM mass M0 : [1 - 1000] GeV. In Fig. 12, one can see that there are two major

dips -- one at  110 GeV and the other at 800 GeV. For the first dip at M0  MS = 110 GeV, the most

dominant annihilation channel is 0¯0  SS (92%). While for the second dip at M0 = M1  ML1 = 800 GeV, 0¯0  L-1 L+1 (72%) appears to be the dominating one. To understand the origin of these dips, let

us first consider a general t-channel process AA  BB. The propagator for the mediator particle (say C)

for such a process can be read as:



1 (pA-pB )2-MC2

,

where

Under

the non-relativistic (NR) limit (pA - pB)2 effectively approaches (MA - MB)2. Now, within this general

framework we are able to discuss the two major dips in Fig. 12.

· M0  110 GeV: As already mentioned, at this value of M0, 0¯0  SS appears to be the most

dominating channel with R as the mediator particle. This being a t-channel process, we have

MA = M0, MB = MS and MC = M  0. Therefore, in the NR limit when M0 tends to MS, the

cross

section

diverges

and

hence

there

is

a

sharp

dip at 110 GeV in the relic density curve.

· M0  800 GeV: Though the arguments for this second dip is exactly same as in the case for the first one, but there is a slight difference. One can directly see that the dip at 800 GeV is not as sharp as the one at 110 GeV. This is mainly due to the presence of W ± (a massive boson) as the mediator particle in the t-channel process 0¯0  L-1 L+1 , dominating over this point of parameter space. In the NR limit (i.e. |p0 - pL±1 |2  0), when M0  ML1, the thermally averaged cross

36

section starts to increase sharply as the denominator of the propagator

1 (p0 -pL±1 )2-MW 2

approaches

its minimum. But unlike the first dip, here the denominator never goes to zero due to the presence

of a massive mediator. So, the dip at M0  800 GeV in the relic density plot is not as sharp as the one for M0  110 GeV. Moreover, when M0 is further increased, the cross section starts to fall gradually and hence there is a rising nature in the 0h2 for M0 > 800 GeV.

Thus for a fixed M1, the above equation becomes only a function of M0 (DM mass) and the mixing angle . Here we note that, Higgs contribution to SI scattering can be completely evaded if one considers the light-quark Yukawa couplings to assume non-Standard Model (non-SM)-like values [132]4. For generating the numerical results we have used the code "micrOMEGAs", as was done for studying the relic density, and analysed the variation of SI scattering cross section as a function of DM mass for sin  = 0.01.

Fig. 14 the variation of SI cross section with respect to M0 is shown by the red line. All the other mass and coupling parameters are fixed at the same values as was done for the relic density analysis [see Table IV]. Mostly, for the entire parameter space, the SI becomes effectively independent of the DM mass, since the Z-mediated scattering process (shown in Fig. 13) appears as the most dominant contributor to the total SI cross section over this mass regime. From the observational side we have mainly considered the LUX [50], PandaX-II [134] and XENON 1T [49] limits, which show that the calculated SI cross section, proportional to sin4 , lies much below the present bounds for the entire mass range. However, the future projected limit coming from LZ collaboration [135] may exclude only a very small region of the parameter space [see Fig. 14]. Further, due to Z-mediation there is a small amount of SD cross section as well, but it is observed to be far below the existing limits.

VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have studied a simple extension where SM is augmented with a pair of vector like lepton doublets L1 and L2 , a SU (2) doublet scalar  in particular. Similarly, singlet-like states including a scalar S and a singlet fermion  are also considered for specific purposes. An additional Z2 × Z2 symmetry has been imposed under which all the SM fields are even while the new fields may be odd under the transformation. Adopting a bottom-up approach, in this paper, we systematically scrutinize the parameter space in terms of the allowed couplings and masses to obtain: (i) the Dirac masses for the SM neutrinos and mixings through a radiative mechanism, (ii) electron and muon (g - 2) discrepancy simultaneously while considering the cLFV and EWPO constraints and finally (iii) a viable DM candidate, consistent with direct detection observations so far.
We start with our proposed model where the new interactions have been introduced. Subsequently we discuss about the relevant constraints on the new parameters by reviewing the different experimental constraints related to the lepton (g - 2) observations, cLFV bounds, vacuum stability conditions, electroweak precision constraints and collider observables. In our model, L1 and  may mix to produce the physical states, and the lightest state 0 can be regarded as the dark matter. Electroweak precision parameters and, more importantly, the null results from the dark matter direct detection experiments require a small mixing between L1 and ; thus we choose sin  = 0.01.
We have shown that in the absence of a tree-level neutrino mass (being forbidden due to the imposed symmetry), one can generate the correct neutrino mass matrix at one-loop level if the Z2 is allowed to break softly. The masses and mixings may be controlled by two free parameters Y2(1i) and Y6(1i) which do not have any effect on the charged lepton flavor processes, e.g., (g - 2)µ/e or different cLFV processes like    and   3 . We have performed a comprehensive study to show the interplay between different charged and neutral vector like leptons for satisfying (g - 2)e and (g - 2)µ bounds simultaneously. A moderately large coupling Y3µ is required to tune (g - 2)µ while ae can easily be controlled with other O(1) couplings. Further, the same diagrams are able to generate    processes when  = . For the 3-body processes like   3 , we have considered all the Z and photon penguin diagrams along with the box contributions. Numerically, we have calculated Br(   ) and Br(   3 ) for different lepton generations and shown their variations as functions of the relevant couplings for two sets of doublet scalar masses (M  400 GeV and 1200 GeV), along with their respective experimental bounds. These cLFV constraints, in addition to the lepton (g -2) results set an important exclusion limit or upper bound for the different Yukawa couplings present in this model. Here, we note that, larger mass value of  is not at all

39
disfavoured in the context of tuning the charged lepton flavor conserving or violating processes. However, the vector like leptons, especially L2 has to be light ( 1 TeV), otherwise, the relevant coupling Y3µ may have to be raised to accommodate (g - 2)µ. Moreover, in the parts of the parameter space, Z-dominance over the -penguin in the computation of the 3-body charged lepton processes may be observed. Finally, the dark matter phenomenology of the singlet-doublet 0 DM has been presented. As shown, a light DM can comply with (g - 2)µ bound, though in general TeV scale values of DM are allowed in our model. This minimal model can be tested at the LHC. Presently a stringent bound can be realized on the mass of vector like leptons L1 and L2, though the mass difference between the VLs and the inert doublet  can be tuned to evade the strong bounds on them. The mass splitting does not have any role on the lepton phenomenology which we have exhaustively studied here.

M = u¯(p1) q2µ(AL1 PL + AR1 PR) + im  µ q (AL2 PL + AR2 PR) u(p)
