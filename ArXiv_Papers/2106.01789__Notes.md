## Abstract

In order to address this issue, we explore two directions: forcing the network to learn a better speaker identity representation by appending an additional loss term; and augmenting the input data pertaining to each speaker using waveform manipulation methods. We show that both methods are efficient when evaluated with both objective and subjective measures. The additional loss term aids the speaker similarity, while the data augmentation improves the intelligibility of the multispeaker TTS system.
