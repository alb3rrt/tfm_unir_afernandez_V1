## Abstract

We study the role of average concurrence in entanglement swapping in quantum networks. We begin with qubit pure states, and there is a very simple rule governing the propagation of average concurrence in multiple swaps. We look at examples of mixed qubit states, and find the relation for pure states gives an upper bound on what is possible with mixed states. We then move on to qudits, where we make use of the I-concurrence. Here the situation is not as simple as for qubits, but in some cases relatively straightforward results can be obtained.
