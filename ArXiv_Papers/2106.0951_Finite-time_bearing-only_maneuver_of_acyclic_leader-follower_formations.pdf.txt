Abstract--This letter proposes two finite-time bearing-based control laws for acyclic leader-follower formations. The leaders in formation move with a bounded continuous reference velocity and each follower controls its position with regard to three agents in the formation. The first control law uses only bearing vectors, and finite-time convergence is achieved by properly selecting two state-dependent control gains. The second control law requires both bearing vectors and communications between agents. Each agent simultaneously localizes and follows a virtual target. Finitetime convergence of the desired formation under both control laws is proved by mathematical induction and supported by numerical simulations.

I. INTRODUCTION
For many years, much research efforts have been put on understanding the mechanisms of collective behaviors displayed in nature and realizing them in large-scale systems such as robotic-, sensor-, traffic-, and electrical networks [1]. A notable application is formation control, where a team of autonomous agents (UAVs, UUVs, mobile robots, etc) is required to achieve and maintain a desired formation shape. Different solutions have been proposed to the problem based on various assumptions on the sensing/controlling/communication variables and topologies among the agents [2].
In the bearing-based approach, the main sensing and controlling variables among the agents are the bearing vectors (aka the directional information) or the subtended angles which can be obtained from low-cost cameras [3]­[5]. Bearing-only formation control of a stationary formation with undirected [6], [7] and special directed topologies such as acyclic leaderfollower [8], [9] or directed cycle [10] have been studied in the literature. In flocking control, the agents simultaneously form a desired formation and agree on their velocities. To achieve flocking behavior, the agents sense the relative geometric variables and the relative velocity with regard to a few followers [11]­[13]. Formation tracking is more demanding since it requires the agents to achieve a target formation and

follow a few leaders, whose velocities can be time-varying. The ability to maintain a moving target formation shape is crucial for engineering applications such as search-and-rescue, truck platooning, or flight maneuvering. The authors in [14] proposed a control law for single and double-integrator agents using the relative positions and relative velocities. Bearingonly formation tracking with constant leaders' velocity has been studied for single integrators [15], [16], double integrators [15], [17], or robotics agents [15], [18]­[20]. However, bearing-only formation tracking with time-varying leader's velocity has not been studied in the literature.
This work considers the bearing-only maneuver problem for directed acyclic leader-follower formations where the leaders' velocity is a bounded continuous function, thus filling a gap in the literature. The directed acyclic leader-follower structure can somehow describe the V-shape formation in immigrating birds, where each bird only sees and follows several individuals (immediate leaders) in its sight [21]. Thus, the interacting graph has a hierarchical structure and the formation is led by a small number of leaders [22], [23]. To ease the analysis, it is assumed that during the formation maneuver, the positions of the immediate leaders are not collinear. Each follower, modeled by a single-integrator, controls its position based on information obtained from exactly three agents. First, a finite time bearing-only formation maneuver control law is proposed. Finite-time convergence of the target formation is achieved by appropriately choosing two control gains based on the measured bearing vectors. Note that this method has not been introduced in existing formation tracking laws in the literature [24]­[26]. Second, in case the agents can communicate with each others, an estimation-based control strategy is proposed. Each agent determines a virtual target point based on the desired bearing vectors and the received position estimates of the immediate leaders. Simultaneously, the agent tracks its target point and sends this information to its followers. Although this control strategy requires more information than just the sensed bearing vectors, the followers have some freedom to choose their own trajectories to reach the target point. Thus, collision avoidance between agents or obstacle can be included under this approach. Finally, simulations are given to support the analysis.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II contains background and formulates the problem studied in this paper. Section III proposes and studies the bearingonly formation tracking law. The target-point based formation tracking strategy is investigated in Section IV. Section V presents simulation results and Section VI concludes the paper.

II. PRELIMINARIES AND PROBLEM FORMULATION

A. Preliminaries

1) Notations: The set of real numbers is denoted by R.

Given x  R, the signum function sign(x) takes value 1, 0,

-1 if x > 0, x = 0, and x < 0, respectively. For  > 0,

sig(x) = sign(x)|x|, where |x| is the absolute value of x.

Also, let x  Rd, one defines |x| =

d i=1

|xi|.

The

kernel

and image of a matrix A  Rn×n are denoted by ker(A)

and im(A). The vec operator is defined as vec(a1, . . . , an) =

[a1 , . . . , an ] . Let A  Rd×d be a symmetric matrix, one

uses i(A) to denote the i-th smallest eigenvalue of A.

Let x be a nonzero vector in Rd, defining the projection

matrix

Px

=

Id -

xx x

2

.

For

any

vector

y



Rd,

Pxy

is

the projection of y onto the orthogonal space of im(x). Px

is symmetric, positive semidefinite, ker(Px) = im(x), and in

addition to a zero eigenvalue, Px has n - 1 eigenvalues 1.

2) Graph theory: A directed graph G consists of a vertex set

V = {1, . . . , n} of |V| = n vertices and an edge set E  V ×V

of |E| = m edges. The neighbor set of a vertex i  V is defined

as Ni = {j  V| (i, j)  E}. A simple path is a sequence of

edges in E connecting vertices in V so that there is no repeated

vertex (excepting for possibly the first and the last vertices)

and edges. If the first and the last vertices of a path coincide,

it is called a directed cycle. G is a directed acyclic graph if it

does not contain any directed cycle. Indexing the edges so that E = {e1, . . . , em}, the incidence matrix H = [hki]  Rm×n

has hki = -1 if i is the starting vertex of ek, hki = 1 if i is

the end vertex of ek, and hki = 0, otherwise.

B. Problem formulation

Consider a formation of n agents in the d-dimensional space

(d  2). Each agent in the formation has a local coordinate system i, and the axes of these local coordinate systems are

aligned to each other. The position of agent i, written in a global coordinate system g, is denoted by pi  Rd.

A formation is characterized by (G, p), where G = (V, E)

represents both the sensing and control interactions among

agents and p = vec(p1, . . . , pn)  Rdn is a configuration

of the formation. If pi = pj, the bearing vector between i

and j is defined as gij =

pj -pi pj -pi

=

zij zij

, where zij

is the

displacement between agents i and j. If (i, j)  E, agent i

can sense gij and control a desired bearing vector gij with

regard to agent j. The set of desired bearing vectors in the

formation is denoted by  = {gij}(i,j)E . It is assumed that  is feasible, i.e., there exists a target configuration p =

vec(p1, . . . , pn)  Rdn satisfying all the bearing vectors in .

Following the definition in [6], (G, p) and (G, q) are bearing

equivalent if and only if P(pi-pj)(qi - qj) = 0, (i, j)  E. They are bearing congruent if and only if P(pi-pj)(qi -qj) = 0, i, j  V, i = j. A formation (G, p) is globally bearing

rigid if any formation (G, q) bearing equivalent to (G, p) is

also bearing congruent to it. The augmented bearing rigidity matrix is defined as R~B =
diag(Pgk )(H  Id). The formation (G, p) is infinitesimally bearing rigid if and only if the kernel of R~B is only spanned by infinitesimal bearing rigid motions, i.e., ker(R~B) = im(1n 

Id, p)

=

im(1n

where

is

the formation centroid.

Suppose that in the formation, there are l  3 leaders

moving under the following equation

pi = vi, i  Vl = {1, . . . , l},

(1)

where vi is the velocity of the leader i. Denote pl = vec(p1, . . . , pl), and vl = vec(v1, . . . , vl). The remaining
agents are followers, which are modeled by single-integrators

pi = ui, i  Vf = {l + 1, . . . , n},

(2)

where pi, ui  Rd are respectively the position and the control input of agent i.
The following assumptions are adopted in this paper:

Assumption 1. The leaders move with the same bounded continuous reference velocity v(t) satisfying v(t) < ,
t  0. Furthermore, no collision happens between the agents.

Assumption 2. The followers cannot sense the leaders' velocity but have information on the upper bound . The bearing sensing and controlling graph G is a directed graph generated by the following procedure:
· Starting with l vertices 1, . . . , l where l  3. · For each l + 1  i  n, inserting vertex i together with
r  3 new edges (i, jk), where jk  {1, . . . , i - 1}.
Obviously, any graph G satisfies Assumption 2 is directed acyclic (see Fig. 1(a) for an example).

Assumption 3. The set of desired bearing vectors  is feasible. The desired bearing vectors of each agent i  Vf , given by gij, j  Ni, are not all parallel to each other.
In this paper, the following problems will be studied.

Problem 1. Let Assumptions 1­3 hold. Design control laws for the followers modeled by (2) using only bearing vector measurements so that gij  gij, (i, j)  E in finite time.
Problem 2. Suppose that Assumptions 1­3 hold. Further, suppose that if (i, j)  E, agent j sends its position estimate p^j to agent i and the leaders have information on their true positions. Design control laws for the followers modeled by (2) so that gij  gij, (i, j)  E in finite time.

Some remarks on the proposed control law (3) are given

as follows. First, ui consists of two terms: the first term

is for controlling the bearing-vectors of the agents to the

desired ones; the second term is included to reject the dis-

turbances resulting from leaders' motions which vary the

bearing vectors. Second, as the leaders are not collinear, Mi is

symmetric positive definite [9]. One has 1(Mi)  n(Mi) =

The

B. Convergence Analysis

Since G has a directed acyclic structure, the analysis begins from the first follower. One will show that the first follower can achieve the desired bearing vectors and follow the leaders in finite time. Finite-time convergence of the overall desired formation will be established based on mathematical induction.

1) The first follower: Consider agent i = l+1 moving under
the control law (3). Define the subformation (Kl, pl), where Kl is the complete graph of l vertices. Because vl belongs to the space of infinitesimal bearing rigid motions of (Kl, pl), the leaders' formation is always bearing congruent to pl.

First, the desired position of follower i is determined by

equations Pgij (pi - pj) = 0, j  Ni. By summing up

these equations, it follows that jNi Pgij (pi - pj) = 0 or

equivalently jNi Pgij pi = jNi Pgij pj . As the leaders

are not colinear, the matrix jNi Pgij is positive definite [9],

and it follows that pi =

P -1
jNi gij

jNi Pgij pj .

Thus, pi = vi =

2) The n-agent formation: Consider agent i  l + 1. The

velocities of agents j  Ni  {1, . . . , i - 1} when they are not in desired positions pj are considered as external inputs to the dynamics of agent i.

suppose that each agent and its neighbors are always non-

Proof: The proof follows by induction. From Lemma 1,

the claim is true for i = l + 1. Next, suppose that the claim

holds until i (l + 1  i  n), then j  Ni, during [0, Tj-1],

uj is bounded and pj = pj for t  Tj-1, where Tk = Tk-1 +

1-

2Vi(Tk-1) 2 (1-)

, k = l + 1, . . . , i - 1 and Tl = 0. Since agent

i and its leaders are not collinear and no collisions happen,

Mi = P jNi gij is always positive definite and ki1, ki2 <  in t  [0, Ti-1]. It follows that pi(t) is bounded and thus

pi(Ti-1) - pi (Ti-1) < .

Next, for t  Ti-1, consider the Lyapunov function Vi =

This means pi(t)  pi in a finite time upper bounded by 1-

where

Therefore, the claim is also true for i = n by mathematical

induction.

Remark 1. Suppose that the leaders' reference velocity satisfy

vl(t)  im(1l  Id, pl(t)), vl(t) = vtlrans(t) + kscale(t)vslcale(t),

where vtlrans(t) = 1l  v and vslcale(t) =

pl -p¯l 1l pl -p¯l 1l

are the

translational and scaling motions of the formation, respec-

tively. Let the translational motion satisfy Assumption 1 and

the scaling motion is given by kscale(t) = k > 0, t  [t1, t2],

0  t1 < t2, and kscale(t) = 0, otherwise. This assumption

describes the fact that the formation mainly moving forward

and the rescaling process is only occasionally performed

during the maneuver, e.g., before and after traversing a narrow

alley. As the scaling motion only happens in finite time and

does not change the bearing vectors between leaders, after the

rescaling process, one can analyze as in Lem. 1 and Thm. 1

to establish the convergence of the desired formation.

Remark 2. Since collision between agents and collinearity of {pj}jNi , i = l + 1, . . . , n are excluded, one cannot conclude in Thm. 1 about global asymptotically stability of
the target formation. Also, the mathematical induction cannot
be established without finite time convergence of each follower since boundedness of pi - pi , t will not be guaranteed.

IV. FINITE-TIME FORMATION MANEUVER VIA TARGET
POINT LOCALIZATION

A. Proposed control law

In this section, we propose another control strategy to solve Problem 2. Instead of directly controlling the position based on the bearing errors, each follower estimates its desired position with regard to the leaders and track that point. The following finite-time control law is proposed:

p^ i =

Pgij sig Pgij (p^j - p^i) 

jNi

+ i

Pgij sign Pgij (p^j - p^i)

(7)

jNi

pi = -sig pi - p^i  - sign pi - p^i ,

(8)

-1
where   (0, 1) and i   P jNi gij . Due to the
directed acyclic structure of the graph G, agent i can also

calculate the target point directly from the information by

pi =

-1

P jNi gij

jNi Pgij pj , and track that point

under the control law (8). In case the beacons are stationary,

a fixed-time network localization law was proposed in [30].

B. Convergence analysis
The convergence analysis can be processed as in the previous section. Consider the first follower i = l+1. The following lemma will be proved.

Lemma 2. Let the assumptions of Problem 2 hold, for i = l + 1, p^i(t)  pi and pi(t)  pi in finite time.

Proof: First, consider the estimation dynamics (7). Using

the Lyapunov function V

that p^j = pj , j  Ni, one has

V = (p^i - pi )

Next, consider the position tracking control law (8) with the

Lyapunov

function

W

=

1 2

pi - p^i

2. For t  Ti,

W = -(pi - p^i) sig pi - p^i 

- (pi - p^i) sign pi - p^i - (pi - p^i) v^i  -|pi - p^i|+1 -  pi - p^i + pi - p^i v^i , (10)

which shows that pi - p^i is globally ultimately bounded. Together with the boundedness of p^i - pi , it follows from the triangle inequality that pi -pi  pi -p^i + p^i -pi , i.e., pi - pi is also bounded.

5

Now, for t  Ti, p^i = pi and v^i = vi  , consider

the

function

W1

Thus,

Theorem 2. Under the control laws (7)­(8), the desired moving formation is achieved in finite time.

Proof: The proof follows from Lemma 2 and mathematical induction on i = l + 1 to n.

Remark 3. Observe that (8) steers the agent to the virtual target along a curve. Let d = 2 and assume that the agents are equipped with proximity sensors which can sense the distance to an obstacle located at po within a small range dmax. To avoid collision with an obstacle, for 0 < d < dmax, (8) can be modified as follows:

ui = -(1 - ) sig pi - p^i  + sign pi - p^i

+  k(pi - po) + gio ,

Remark 4. A fixed-time position estimation dynamics can be designed based on (7) and [31] as follows:

where 0 <  < 1 and  > 1. Note that (12) is also applicable for leader-follower formations.

V. SIMULATION RESULTS

A. Simulation 1: Bearing-only control law

Consider a formation of 12 agents with graph as shown

in Fig. 1(a). Agents 1­4 are leaders, which move with the reference velocity vl given as follows

· For t  [0, 10], vl = 14  f1, where f1 = [1.9 - 0.14t, 0] . Leaders move in straight lines along the x-

axis. At t = 10, v1(10) = [0.5, 0] .

is the geometric center of four leaders. Leaders go along

the x-axis and downscale the formation's size to fit the

alley. At t = 15s, v1(15) = [0.5, 0] . · For t  (15, 25], vl = 14  f3, where f3 = [0.5 +
0.05(t - 15), 0] . Leaders move through the alley. At

t = 25s, v1(25) = [1, 0] .

·

For

.

The formation has passed the alley. Leaders go along the

x-axis and upscale the formation's size back to normal.

At t = 30s, v1(30) = [1, 0] .

· For t  (30, 35], vl = 14  f5, where f5 = [1 + 0.1(t - 30), 0] . The formation accelerates and continues to move forward along the x-axis.
The followers adopt the control law (3) with  = 4,  = 0.5. The simulation results are depicted in Fig. 1(b),(c). The target formation shape is achieved in less than 1 second (see Fig. 1(b)). After that, the bearing constraints are maintained except when the formation rescales its size.
B. Simulation 2: Target point localization-based control law
The same 12-agent formation is simulated under the control law (7)­(8) for 5 second. The initial estimates are randomly selected. The trajectories of the agents are depicted in Fig. 2(a). The desired formation is achieved in less than 1 second and maintained after that.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this letter, two finite-time bearing-based tracking control laws for acyclic leader-follower formations have been proposed. The analysis partially explains how individuals can follow leaders, who are moving at a time-varying velocity, in collective behaviors such as bird immigration. As suggested in [23], it will be interesting to consider the problem with delay and switching in sensing/communication, or when agents can measure only the subtended bearing angles.
