Abstract We study the Z3 gauge theory with fermions on the quantum computer using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm with IBM QISKit software. Using up to 9 qubits we are able to obtain accurate results for the ground state energy. Introducing nonzero chemical potential we are able to determine the Equation of State (EOS) for finite density on the quantum computer. We discuss possible realizations of quantum advantage for this system over classical computers with regards to finite density simulations and the fermion sign problem.

1 Introduction
Discrete gauge theories are excellent models to study on a quantum computer as they can be realized with fewer qubits than gauge theories with continuous groups like SU (2) or SU (3) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5][6] [7] [8]. When coupled to fermions at finite density and nonzero chemical potential they can have a sign problem which presents an opportunity for an advantage for quantum computing over classical computing. Also one can study time evolution for the discrete gauge models which is also difficult to simulate classically. In this paper we study the Z3 gauge model coupled to fermions. This model will allow us to study the aspect of discrete gauge models described above that can potentially lead to quantum advantage.
This paper is organized as follows. In section two we describe the Hamiltonian for the Z3 gauge model and how to represent the variables in terms of qubits. We also describe the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm and how it can be applied to the Z3 gauge model. We describe the simplest configuration of two fermion vertices and one gauge link. In section three we describe the calculation for three fermion vertices and two gauge links and in section four we discuss a system with three fermion vertices and three gauge links. In section five we introduce a chemical potential and describe the equation of state at finite density. In section seven we state the main conclusions for the paper.

The above Hamiltonian is realized in terms of staggered fermions as in studies of the Schwinger model [9] [10] [11] although on can also consider Wilson fermions as in [12]. For the simplest case of two fermion sites and one link we define the discretized operators in terms of qubits for the fermions as:

c1 =

01 00



10 01

 I3

c2 =

10 0 -1

and for the boson link as: where :

(2.3) (2.4)

and

P = SXS

(2.5)

with S the Sylvester matrix given by:

1  e2i/3 1 e-2i/3  S=  1 1 1 
3 e-2i/3 1 e2i/3

(2.6)

Defined this way the Hamiltonian is a 12 × 12 matrix but one can easily adjoin a 4 × 4 identity to it to make the Hamiltonian 16 × 16 and represent it in terms of 4 qubits.
To determine the ground state of the Hamiltonian on a quantum computer we use the Variational Quantum Eigensolver alogorithm (VQE). The VQE is a hybrid quantumclassical algorithm based on the variational method of quantum mechanics. One ontains an upper bound on the ground state energy by minimizing the expression:

E0(i) =

(i)| H |(i) (i)| (i)

(2.7)

The parameters of the variational wave function i are angles associated with Unitary gates the can be realized on a quantum computer. The Hamiltonian can be expanded in

terms a sum of tensor product of the the three Pauli matrices plus the Identity matrix

which can also be represented on the quantum computer.The minimization over the angles

i is done using an optimizer running on a classical computer. This is what the VQE algorithm is a classical-quantum algorithm as dome parts of the computation are done on

the quantum computer and others are done using classical computing. More details on the

implementation of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm can be found in [13].

For the 4 qubit Hamiltonian we found using the VQE and the Sequential Least SQuares

Programming (SLSQP) an upperbound on the ground state energy with results in table

1 which are close to the exact value determined by exact diagonalization. We used the

state-vector simulator in IBM QISKit for the simulations in this paper. Other simula-

tors available in QISKit include the QASM simulator with the ability to simulate noise

on a quantum computer. Other backends beside the simulator include various hardware

quantum computer implementations using superconducting qubits available from IBM. In

addition to the ground state energy the VQE also determines an final variational form

which can be taken as an approximation to the ground state wave function. On a quantum

computer this is represented as a quantum circuit.

The Hamiltonian is represented by a 72 × 72 matrix. One can adjoin onto it a 56 Identity matrix to make the Hamiltonian 128 × 128 and represent it on the quantum computer in terms of seven qubits.

5 Equation of state (EOS) at finite density
To determine the Equation of state for the Z3 gauge model coupled to fermions we consider the three fermion vertex three gauge link case considered above and vary the chemical potential at zero temperature. Then the estimate for the ground state energy obtained from the VQE at different chemical potentials will yield an equation of state as a function of chemical potential. The result of the eight qubit calculations are shown in figure 5. For this calculation we fixed the gauge coupling at g = .15 and mass m = 1.0. The equation of state shows the correct behavior with energy rising linearly with the chemical potential. Note the VQE calculations are consistently above the exact values which is expected because the VQE algorithm determines an upper bound on the Energy for each value of the chemical potential.

6 Conclusions
In paper we studied Z3 gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions coupled to fermions. We used the hybrid classical-VQE quantum algorithm and obtain highly accurate results compared with exact diagonalization. We studied the theory at finite density to examine the equation of state for the model at finite chemical potential a quantity which is difficult to examine classically. Because of the presence of sign problems, finite density, non zero chemical potential and time evolution the Z3 gauge theory coupled to fermions is an excellent model to pursue quantum advantage over classical computers especially with the increase in the number of qubits and improved development of noise mitigation techniques. It will also be interesting to explore the finite temperature equation of state for this model as well perhaps using a thermo-double approach to realizing finite temperature on a quantum computer[15] [16] [17] [18]. Finally it will be interesting see if the variational Schrodinger wave function approach to higher dimensional QCD [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] can realized in terms of quantum computing by adapting the classical variational techniques to the quantum computing variational approaches in terms of gates on near term quantum hardware.
