## Abstract

Odd numbers can be indexed by the map k(n)=(n-3)/2, n belonging to 2N+3. We first propose a basic primality test using this index function that was first introduced in article (8). Input size of operations is reduced which improves computational time by a constant. We then apply similar techniques to Atkin prime-numbers sieve which uses modulus operations and finally to Pritchard wheel sieve, in both case yielding similar results.
