## Abstract

When the climate system is forced, e.g. by emission of greenhouse gases, it responds on multiple time scales. As temperatures rise, feedback processes might intensify or weaken. Current methods to analyze feedback strength, however, do not take such state dependency into account; they only consider changes in (global mean) temperature and assume all feedbacks are linearly related to that. This makes (transient) changes in feedback strengths almost intangible and generally leads to underestimation of future warming. Here, we present a multivariate (and spatially explicit) framework that facilitates dissection of climate feedbacks over time scales. Using this framework, information on the composition of projected (transient) future climates and feedback strengths can be obtained. Moreover, it can be used to make projections for many emission scenarios through linear response theory. The new framework is illustrated using the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2).
