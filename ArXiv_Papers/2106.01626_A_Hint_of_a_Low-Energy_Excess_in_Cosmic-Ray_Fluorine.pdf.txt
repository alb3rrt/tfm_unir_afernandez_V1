ABSTRACT
Since its launch, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer­02 (AMS-02) has delivered outstanding quality measurements of the spectra of cosmic-ray (CR) species, p¯, e±, and nuclei (H­O, Ne, Mg, Si, Fe), which resulted in a number of breakthroughs. The most recent AMS-02 result is the measurement of the spectrum of CR fluorine up to 2 TV. Given its very low solar system abundance, fluorine in CRs is thought to be mostly secondary, produced in fragmentations of heavier species, predominantly Ne, Mg, and Si. Similar to the best-measured secondary-to-primary boron to carbon nuclei ratio that is widely used to study the origin and propagation of CR species, the precise fluorine data would allow the origin of Si-group nuclei to be studied independently. Meanwhile, the secondary origin of CR fluorine has never been tested in a wide energy range due to the lack of accurate CR data. In this paper, we use the first ever precise measurements of the fluorine spectrum by AMS-02 together with ACE-CRIS and Voyager 1 data to actually test this paradigm. Our detailed modeling shows an excess below 10 GV in the fluorine spectrum that is most likely due to the primary fluorine component. We also provide an updated local interstellar spectrum (LIS) of fluorine in the rigidity range from few MV to 2 TV. Our calculations employ the self-consistent GALPROP­HELMOD framework that has proved to be a reliable tool in deriving the LIS of CR p¯, e-, and nuclei Z  28.

1. INTRODUCTION
The precise data delivered by the new generation of space instrumentation allow the stellar nucleosynthesis, properties of the interstellar medium (ISM), and the origin of CRs to be probed to much finer details than possible a decade ago. The measurements provided by individual spacecraft, can be combined to cover the enormous range of rigidities, from few MV to tens of TV, where the individual spectra of CR species are shaped by many different processes. Their analysis and interpretation enables the discoveries of new phenomena far outside of the local solar neighborhood.
The spectrum of CR fluorine from AMS-02 (Aguilar et al. 2021) is the latest in a series of publications of spectra of most abundant species, H­O, Ne, Mg, Si, Fe (Aguilar et al. 2014, 2015a,b, 2016a,b, 2017, 2018a,b, 2019a,b, 2020; Aguilar et al. 2021). Fluorine is less studied because its CR abundance is 100 and 10 times lower than that of its neighbors, oxygen and neon, correspondingly. Previous mea-

surement of its spectrum in the range from 0.62­35 GeV nucleon-1 was made by the HEAO-3-C2 instrument in 19791981 (Engelmann et al. 1990). Although an excellent instrument for its epoch, HEAO-3-C2 measurements exhibit significant systematic uncertainties when compared to the AMS-02 data (see detailed analyses in Boschini et al. 2020a, 2021).
The secondary-to-primary nuclei ratio in CRs is widely used in astrophysics to derive the parameters of Galactic CR propagation for an assumed model phenomenology. The derived parameters are then applied to all CR species from electrons and antiprotons, all the way up to the Fe-group nuclei. The best measured B/C ratio is used most often. Other nuclei that are rare in the solar system, such as Li, Be, F, Sc, V, are thought to be almost entirely produced by the fragmentation of heavier CRs species. Their precise measurements can be used to probe the origin and propagation of specific groups of nuclei: the B/C ratio for the C-N-O group, F/Si for the Si-group, and (Sc+Ti+V)/Fe for the Fe-group. How-

ever, this common wisdom has never been tested in a wide energy range due to the lack of accurate data. The first ever precisely measured fluorine spectrum by AMS-02 (Aguilar et al. 2021) together with ACE-CRIS (Lave et al. 2013) and Voyager 1 (Cummings et al. 2016) data offer a possibility to actually test this paradigm.
In this paper we analyze the new CR fluorine data and test their consistency with measurements of other species. We show that the spectrum of fluorine exhibits an excess below 10 GV and argue that its most likely interpretation is a primary fluorine component. We also provide an updated fluorine LIS in the rigidity range from few MV to 2 TV. Our calculations and interpretation employ the GALPROP1­ HELMOD2 framework that is proved to be a reliable tool in deriving the LIS of CR species (Boschini et al. 2019, 2020a).
This is the third in a series of papers where the detailed analysis of precise AMS-02 measurements taken together with Voyager 1 and ACE-CRIS data yields unexpected excesses in the spectra of CR species. The first two was a hint for a primary lithium in CRs (Boschini et al. 2020b), and a discovery of the low-energy excess in iron (Boschini et al. 2021).
2. CALCULATIONS
In this work we are using the same CR propagation model with distributed reacceleration and convection that was used in our previous analyses (for more details see Boschini et al. 2017, 2018a,b, 2020a,b, 2021). The latest versions of the GALPROP code for Galactic propagation of CRs and the HELMOD code for heliospheric propagation are described in detail in a recent paper by Boschini et al. (2020a), see also references therein.
The values of propagation parameters along with their confidence limits are derived from the best available CR data using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine. Five main propagation parameters, that affect the overall shape of CR spectra, were left free in the scan using GALPROP running in 2D mode: the Galactic halo half-width zh, the normalization of the diffusion coefficient D0 at the reference rigidity R = 4 GV and the index of its rigidity dependence , the Alfve´n velocity VAlf , and the gradient of the convection velocity dVconv/dz (Vconv = 0 in the plane, z = 0). Their best-fit values tuned to the AMS-02 data are listed in Table 1 and are the same as obtained in Boschini et al. (2020a). The radial size of the Galaxy does not significantly affect the values of propagation parameters and was set to 20 kpc. We also introduced a factor  in the diffusion coefficient, where  = v/c, and  was left free. The best fit value of  = 0.70 improves the agreement at low energies, and slightly affects the choice of injection indices 0 an 1. A detailed discussion of the injection (I) and propagation (P) scenarios of the 350 GV break can be found in the works by Vladimirov et al. (2012) and Boschini et al. (2020a).

with index 1 =  below the break and index 2 = 0.15 ± 0.03 above the break at R = 370 ± 25 GV (for details see

Boschini et al. 2020b).

The corresponding B/C ratio also remains the same (see Fig. 4 of Boschini et al. 2020a), and compares well with all available measurements: Voyager 1 (Cummings et al. 2016), ACE-CRIS3 (Lave et al. 2013), AMS-02 (Aguilar et al. 2018a), ATIC-2 (Panov et al. 2009), CREAM (Ahn et al. 2008, 2009), and NUCLEON (Grebenyuk et al. 2019).
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Fig. 1 (left panel) shows a comparison of the AMS-02 fluorine data (Aguilar et al. 2021) with the calculated spectrum assuming the species is entirely secondary. The calculated spectral shape resembles the data, while the default normalization appears to be a bit too high over the whole range. The middle panel shows the default fluorine spectrum multiplied by a factor of 0.896 and the corresponding residuals. Here we normalized our calculated spectrum to the data in the middle rigidity range 10­100 GV. We attribute this 10% discrepancy to the errors in the isotopic production cross sections that is well within their typical uncertainties (see a detailed discussion in Appendix C.1 in Boschini et al. 2020a). The quality of the fit improves with this modification. But after the renormalization, there is now a 6­7% excess below 10 GV, which is significant given the number of excess data points. At higher rigidities >100 GV, the residuals become larger, as do the error bars, that keep the overall agreement to better than 1. The right panel shows the renormalized fluorine (×0.896) with the primary propagated fluorine component, where the total calculated spectrum is tuned to the data. The dashed cyan line shows separately the propagated primary fluorine component. An addition of the primary fluorine removes the excess below 10 GV and preserves the good agreement with data above 10 GV. The parameters of the injection spectrum of primary fluorine are summarized in Table 2. The injection spectrum is steep with index 2.90 above 4.50 GV implying an acceleration in a weak shock.

Apart from the overall normalization, possibly attributable to insufficiently constrained fluorine production cross sections (which however become fairly flat 1 GeV/nucleon), we see three possible reasons for the observed low-energy (<10 GV) excess: (i) an underestimate of the total inelastic cross section of fluorine, which has a broad minimum at a few 100 MeV nucleon-1 (see, e.g., Fig. 6 in Ge´nolini et al. 2018 and Fig. 1 in Wellisch & Axen 1996), (ii) the effective diffusion coefficient in the rigidity range 1-10 GV is somewhat smaller than that derived from the B/C ratio, and (iii) a primary fluorine component. We note that the fine tuning of the low-rigidity part in the Ne, Mg, and Si spectra does not help to remove the excess in fluorine though could make it somewhat less significant. We, therefore, proceed with our original spectra that are optimized to the Ne, Mg, and Si data.
Underestimation of the total inelastic cross section of fluorine as a primary reason for the excess can be excluded by consideration of the accelerator data. Bobchenko et al. (1979) provide a table of measured proton-nucleus cross sections for the proton momenta from 5 GeV/c to 9 GeV/c that correspond to ambient 19F rigidity range 11­19 GV in the inverse kinematics, while the measurement accuracy is stated as 1-2%. The parameterizations of the total inelastic cross sections used in the calculations (e.g., Barashenkov & Polanski 1994) are tuned to the available data. That makes a significant error at around 5 GV, the maximum in the fluorine excess, rather unlikely. We note that a similar excess in the

spectra of neighboring nuclei, such as O, Ne, Mg, Si, is absent (Boschini et al. 2020a).
Variations in the diffusion coefficient seem unlikely as well. The ratio F/Si is the Si-group analog of the widely used B/C or B/O ratio for the light species. Both the F/Si and F/Ne ratios are consistent with predictions based on the propagation parameters derived from the B/C ratio above 10 GV. However, they demonstrate 6-7% deviation in the rigidity range 3­7 GV, which is significant given the number of excess data points. In terms of the diffusion coefficient, it would mean that the effective diffusion coefficient in this rigidity range probed by the F/Si and F/Ne ratios is about 10% smaller than that in the case of the B/C ratio. Assuming the same distribution of sources of CR C, O, Ne, Mg, and Si nuclei, and given that the total inelastic cross sections of 16O (320 mb) and 20Ne (380 mb) are about the same, with neon being the main contributor to CR fluorine (see Moskalenko et al. 2013 and Appendix C.1 in Boschini et al. 2020a), the B/C, F/Si, and F/Ne ratios are probing essentially the same Galactic volume. The total inelastic cross section of 28Si (465 mb) is only a factor of 1.3 larger, which corresponds to the effective propagation distance of a factor of 0.90 smaller than that of O and Ne (Jo´hannesson et al. 2016). Here the values are given for the energy range of the excess, i.e. at a few GeV nucleon-1.
Meanwhile, we note that the measured spectra of the light primary nuclei He, C, O are flatter than the spectra of the Sigroup nuclei, Ne, Mg, Si, with the difference in indices being 0.045 above 90 GV (Aguilar et al. 2020). If the difference in indices between O and Si nuclei is confirmed with larger statistics, it may indicate a somewhat different distribution of

their sources. Besides that, measurements of other species, such as Na and Al spectra, P/S ratio, and especially the ratio of the iron group nuclei (Sc+Ti+V)/Fe, can be used to probe the variations of the diffusion coefficient in the local Galaxy.
The most likely reason for the fluorine excess is the presence of the primary fluorine at low energies. We already discussed a hint for the primary fluorine in CRs in Boschini et al. (2020a, Appendix C.1), but the large error bars and large scattering of the HEAO-3-C2 data points made this result inconclusive. The first ever accurate measurement of the fluorine spectrum in the rigidity range from 2 GV­2 TV (Aguilar et al. 2021) allows the fluorine spectrum to be analyzed in fine details. The newly found fluorine excess is significant.
In the Appendix, we provide an analytical parameterization of the secondary-only renormalized fluorine LIS, Eq. (A1), and the total fluorine LIS, Eq. (A2), that includes also the primary component. The parameters are provided in Tables 3 and 4, correspondingly. We also provide numerical tables for both cases, which tabulate the LIS in rigidity R (Table 5) and in kinetic energy Ekin per nucleon (Table 6) for the secondary-only fluorine LIS, and corresponding Tables 7, 8 for the total fluorine LIS. The analytical parameterizations, Eqs. (A1), (A2) and numerical tables include a rigidity-independent normalization factor, a=0.896.
4. PRIMARY FLUORINE
Precise CR measurements over the last decade have lead to the discoveries of new features in spectra of CR species, various breaks and excesses in the energy range from subGeV to multi-TeV. Using combined measurements of AMS02, Voyager 1, and ACE-CRIS we were able to establish a presence of primary lithium in CRs (Boschini et al. 2020b), and to discover the low-energy excess in iron (Boschini et al. 2021). In the present paper, we argue that there is also a lowenergy excess in fluorine. These excesses may harbor the keys to understanding our local Galactic environment. Here we discuss potential sources of primary CR fluorine.
The ISM abundance of fluorine is anomalously low because it is easily destroyed in stars through either p- or -captures. Its solar system abundance relative to oxygen ranges from (F/O) = 7.4 × 10-5 in the solar photosphere to 10.5 × 10-5 in meteorites (Asplund et al. 2009). This can be compared with the derived F/O ratio in CR sources: (F/O)srs = 4 × 10-4 or [F/O]srs = 0.6 - 0.7 dex dependently on the (F/O) used, where [X/Y] = log10(X/Y)­ log10(X/Y) . Here we integrated over the injection spectra of primary fluorine (Table 2) and oxygen (Tables 2, 3 in Boschini et al. 2020a) above 1 GV, where the excess is observed.

If integrated above 0.1 GV, then the ratio becomes (F/O)srs = 1.7 × 10-4 or [F/O]srs = 0.21 - 0.36 dex, to be closer to the solar system abundance.
The origin of cosmic fluorine is still not well constrained. Several nucleosynthetic channels at different phases of stellar evolution have been suggested, but these must be constrained by observations. The main astrophysical sources of fluorine are thought to be supernovae Type II (SN II), Wolf­ Rayet (WR) stars, and the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) of intermediate-mass stars (e.g., Meynet & Arnould 2000; Renda et al. 2004; Olive & Vangioni 2019). These sources become important at different stages of chemical evolution of the Galaxy, with the -spallation of neon in SN II dominating at early times in low metallicity environment, while WR and AGB stars dominating at the later stages at solar and supersolar metallicities. The calculations show that reaching the solar level of [F/O] = 0 at the present epoch requires all three types of sources to contribute (Renda et al. 2004).
Meanwhile, determining the fluorine abundance in stars is challenging. A diagnostic is via observations of molecular HF emission lines in the K and N bands (2.1­2.4 µm and 8­13 µm, respectively), which are observable only in cool giants (Teff < 4500 K). Analysis of the spectra of K giants show that the fluorine-to-oxygen abundance ratio [F/O] increases as a function of oxygen abundance [O/H] with a slope 1±0.2, and can reach [F/O]0.4 dex for [O/H]0.2 dex (Ryde et al. 2020). Behavior like this is typical for the so-called "secondary" elements, whose synthesis in stars involves nuclides pre-existing in the ISM gas of which stars form. A corresponding abundance ratio for the so-called "primary" elements would be a constant, because the abundances of primary elements increase proportionally to metallicity. An example of a primary element is oxygen.
The key isotope that contributes to the production of fluorine in different environments is 14N, which is converted to fluorine via a series of proton and  captures 14N(, )18F (+)18O(p,)15N(,)19F in the presence of 13C; the latter is needed for the generation of protons (Goriely et al. 1990; Prantzos et al. 2018). Such reactions can take place in rapidly rotating massive stars, thermally pulsating AGB stars, and massive WR stars. Novae are also proposed as a possible source of fluorine through proton captures by 17O. A useful review of fluorine nucleosynthesis is given in Ryde et al. (2020).
Our identification of a primary CR fluorine component is another (indirect) way of studying the synthesis of this species in CR sources. This is the first time that the abun-

6

dance of primary fluorine is established. If true, the fluorine overabundance in the CR sources ([F/O]srs = 0.6 - 0.7 dex above 1 GV or 0.21 - 0.36 dex above 0.1 GV) hints at perhaps yet unknown processes acting at certain stages of stellar evolution. Important clues to the origin of primary fluorine, and the nature of CR sources in the local Galaxy, can be deduced from observation (or non-observation) of low-energy excesses in the spectra of other mostly secondary elements of the Si-group, such as Na and Al.

this excess and rule out the underestimate of the total inelastic cross section of fluorine and the variations in the diffusion coefficient as the primary reasons for the excess.
We conclude that the most likely reason for the excess is a contribution of primary fluorine, and discuss its main astrophysical sources. We present the derived injection spectrum of the primary fluorine that may provide clues to its origin. As in all our previous papers, we also provide an analytical parameterization and numerical tables of the fluorine LIS.

5. CONCLUSION
Using the combined data of AMS-02 (Aguilar et al. 2021), ACE-CRIS (Lave et al. 2013), and Voyager 1 (Cummings et al. 2016) we analyzed the spectrum of fluorine over a wide rigidity range from MV to 2 TV. We found moderate discrepancies with the predictions made with the GALPROPHELMOD framework.
First, the default normalization of the whole spectrum was found to be off by 10%. We attribute this discrepancy to the errors in the isotopic production cross sections that is well inside of the their typical uncertainties. Second, the renormalized fluorine spectrum and renormalized F/Si and F/Ne ratios show an excess below 10 GV. We discuss possible origin of

A. ANALYTICAL PARAMETERIZATION AND NUMERICAL TABLES OF THE FLUORINE LIS

Here we provide an analytical parameterization of the secondary-only renormalized fluorine LIS:





b + cR + dR5 - f R2 - gG(R) R - hR2G(R) - iRG2(R), 

R  2.5 GV,

(A1)

where R is the particle rigidity in GV, the values of the fitting parameters from a to z are given in Table 3, and the function G(x)

is defined as:

G(x) = e-x2

The analytical representation, Eq. (A1), is also complemented by numerical tables calculated for the I-scenario, which tabulate the LIS in rigidity R (Table 5) and in kinetic energy Ekin per nucleon (Table 6).
We also provide an analytical parameterization of the total fluorine LIS, which includes the primary component:

 o - pR - qR log R - rG(R) + sG3(R) + tR2G(R) - uG[v + zG(R)], 

R  2.5 GV,

where R is the particle rigidity in GV, the values of the fitting parameters from a to z are given in Table 4, and the function G(x) is defined above. The analytical representation, Eq. (A2), is also complemented by numerical tables calculated for the I-scenario, which tabulate the LIS in rigidity R (Table 7) and in kinetic energy Ekin per nucleon (Table 8).
