Abstract
Throughput-Outage scaling laws for single-hop cache-aided device-to-device (D2D) communications have been extensively investigated under the assumption of the protocol model. However, the corresponding performance under physical models has not been explored; in particular it remains unclear whether link-level power control and scheduling can improve the asymptotic performance. This paper thus investigates the throughput-outage scaling laws of cache-aided single-hop D2D networks considering a general physical channel model. By considering the networks with and without the equal-throughput assumption, we analyze the corresponding outer bounds and provide the achievable performance analysis. Results show that when the equal-throughput assumption is considered, using link-level power control and scheduling cannot improve the scaling laws. On the other hand, when the equal-throughput assumption is not considered, we show that the proposed double time-slot framework with appropriate link-level power control and scheduling can significantly improve the throughput-outage scaling laws, where the fundamental concept is to first distinguish links according to their communication distances, and then enhance the throughput for links with small communication distances.
I. INTRODUCTION In the past few years, the demand of video services has increased rapidly for mobile devices [2], and thus significant efforts have been made to deal with such challenge [3], [4]. Although the improvement

from conventional approaches [5], e.g., use of additional spectrum, including massive antenna systems, and adopting network densifications, can partially resolve the challenge, the improvement might still be inadequate and inefficient [6]. In this context, caching at the wireless edge was introduced and investigated to further improve the network performance [6].1
The fundamental concept of caching at the wireless edge is to convert memory to bandwidth by prefetching and caching the popular video content at the network edge nodes so that the video content can be rapidly delivered to users with low cost when demanded [6]. Thus, this along with the concentration of the popularity can bring huge benefits to the network. Recent investigations have revealed that by introducing the caching technologies at the wireless edge, the network can be improved by orders of magnitude in practical simulations [7], [8] and alter the fundamental scaling in theoretical analysis [9]­[12].
Due to the significance of having caching at the wireless edge, the approach has been investigated in different scenarios [8], [13]­[15]. These include caching in BSs [6], caching on devices [7], caching in heterogeneous networks [16], caching in vehicles [17], etc. As caching on devices along with high performance device-to-device (D2D) communications can bring huge benefits to the network without installing new infrastructure, cache-aided wireless D2D networks have been widely discussed in the literature [13]­[15]. While many papers investigate the design and implementation aspects, another set of investigations focuses on characterizing the asymptotic behavior as the number of users N goes to infinity. Such investigations are commonly referred to as scaling law analysis, where the analysis results can be used to understand the fundamental limits and benefits of the network [10]­[12]. This paper aims to contribute to this range of investigations for cache-aided wireless D2D networks.

A. Related Literature

The scaling laws for wireless D2D/ad-hoc networks without caching have been studied for many years

since the seminal work in [18].2 Known as one of most representative papers for scaling law analysis, [18]

studied the transport capacity of the network under protocol and physical models and characterized the

throughput scaling laws, where the derived achievable throughput and upper bound in the case of adopting

the multi-hop D2D communication were   1

and  1 , respectively. Refs [19] and [20]

extended the analysis and showed that the upper bound is 

1 N

even under more general conditions.

When users are distributed according to a Poisson point process, [21] showed that the optimal achievable

the conventional approaches, and thus further improve the network performance.

throughput for wireless D2D networks is  1 , matching the upper bound suggested in [19] and [20]. N
In addition to the above mentioned papers, scaling law analysis has been conducted for networks with more complicated settings and/or channel models. For example, analysis considering fading was dicussed in [20]; analysis considering a specific user mobility model was provided in [22]; analysis considering multicasting benefit was presented in [23]; and analysis involving a special distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) structure, known as hierarchical cooperation, was introduced in [24].

Although cache-aided D2D networks have been investigated for years by the computer science commu-

nity [25]­[28], their fundamental scaling behaviors were not the focus until the early 2010s. Known as one

of the earliest scaling law analysis for cache-aided D2D networks, [29] characterized the scaling law of the

maximum expected throughput in cache-aided single-hop D2D networks under the protocol model. Since

focusing on the maximum expected throughput characterization ignores the outage probability analysis,

[30] and [10] remedied this aspect and provided the throughput-outage scaling law analysis again for

cache-aided single-hop D2D with protocol model. The results showed that when the outage probability is

negligibly small and the popularity distribution is a heavy-tailed Zipf distribution, the throughput scales

with 

S M

, where M is the number of contents in the library and S is the cache space of a device. By

considering the more practical MZipf popularity distribution, the results of [10] were then generalized in

[11].

Cache-aided multihop D2D scaling laws were firstly analyzed in [31], where the average traffic per

node was characterized with users located on a regular grid and with a fairly simplified channel model.

Then, the throughput-outage scaling law analysis was provided in [32] under the protocol model. The

results showed that when the outage probability is vanishing, the achievable throughput per user is



S M log(N )

for heavy-tailed Zipf popularity distributions, while the upper bound is 

S log(N ) M

.

This upper bound was improved to 

S M

in [33], where the more practical physical model was used

and a fully centralized caching policy was considered. Considering the pros and cons in [31]­[33], [12]

studied the cache-aided multihop D2D scaling laws adopting the Poisson point process (PPP) for the user

distribution, physical model for transmissions, decentralized policy for caching, and MZipf distribution for

popularity. Results in [12] demonstrated that when the outage probability is negligibly small, the optimal

throughput per user is 

S M

for heavy-tailed MZipf distribution and is 

MZipf distribution, where q is the plateau factor of the MZipf distribution.

The above literature considered conventional single-hop and multihop D2D for communications with users more or less uniformly distributed within the network, though there exist papers also considering more complicated settings and communication schemes. For example, in [34], a scaling law analysis was conducted for the cache-aided hierarchical cooperation approach. Besides, the scaling law in cache-

4

aided D2D networks considering nonuniform user distribution was investigated in [35]. Moreover, when involving coding and multicasting schemes, coded cache-aided D2D was proposed and analyzed in [36]­ [40].

B. Contributions

In this paper, we focus on the scaling law analysis for cache-aided single-hop D2D networks. By the

above literature review, we observe that the scaling law investigations for single-hop cache-aided D2D

networks, i.e., [10], [11], [29], were conducted mostly with protocol model. However, the protocol model

might be oversimplified, as it cannot incorporate the influence of link-level power control and scheduling

into the analysis. A more realistic model to use is the physical model [19], in which the influence of link-

level power control and scheduling can be accommodated. Although the suitable scheduling and power

control algorithms have been investigated for finite-size networks and performance has been investigated

by simulations [41]­[44], to the best of our knowledge, the scaling behaviors for cache-aided single-hop

D2D networks with physical model have not been explored, and it is unclear whether and how the link-

level power control and scheduling can further improve the scaling laws as compared with those derived

under protocol model. This paper thus aims to contribute to this aspect.

Specifically, this paper considers a single-hop cache-aided D2D network with MZipf popularity dis-

tribution and with users to be uniformly distributed in the network. We conduct the throughput-outage

scaling law analysis with the generalized physical model.3 We consider two fundamental scenarios for

the networks, where scenario 1 assumes that the link-level throughput realizations are equal for all users

in the network and scenario 2 relaxes the assumption such that different users can have different link-

level throughput realizations, leading to certain unfairness. It should be noted that since the unfairness

of the second scenario is only on the realization level, users in either scenario on average have the same

throughput, namely, users are treated statistically fair in both scenarios.

We consider the regime that the outage probability is negligibly small or converging to zero for the

analysis, and conduct both the achievable and outer bound analysis assuming M, N  . Specifically,

when the MZipf distribution is heavy-tailed, i.e.,  < 1 and q  , where  is the Zipf factor of

the distribution, we show that the upper bound of the throughput per user for scenario 1 is 

S M

when the outage probability is negligibly small, which is identical to the throughput-outage scaling laws

assuming the protocol model [11]. This indicates that the performance of single-hop cache-aided D2D

networks cannot be asymptotically improved by link-level power control and scheduling in scenario 1.

3Although the scaling laws of the bounded physical model could be more realistic, as indicated in [19], they can be viewed as special cases of the scaling laws derived considering the generalized physical channel. Therefore, we in this paper focus on the generalized physical model for brevity. This assumption will discussed in detail in Sec. II.A.

5

Note that the assumption that q   is to avoid the situation that the MZipf distribution degenerates to

a Zipf distribution asymptotically. In contrast, we demonstrate that in scenario 2, by using the proposed

1-

throughput-enhancing approach, the throughput per user upper bound can be enhanced to 

S 2- M

while the outage probability retains negligibly small. The fundamental concept of the proposed throughput-

enhancing approach is to let transmitter (TX)-receiver (RX) pairs with small communication distances

to communicate with a very high speed under appropriate link-level power control and scheduling. In

addition to the outer bound analysis, the achievable schemes for both scenarios 1 and 2 adopting  < 1

are proposed, and the analysis shows that the proposed schemes can achieve their corresponding outer

bounds.

We conduct the analysis also for the light-tailed MZipf distribution, where  > 1 and q   is

considered. We show in this case that the user throughput upper bound is 

S q

with negligibly small

outage probability for scenario 1, again indicating that using link-level power control and scheduling

cannot improve the throughput-outage scaling law in scenario 1. On the other hand, we demonstrate that

the throughput upper bound can be enhanced to 

S q

with negligibly small outage probability by

the proposed throughput-enhancing approach for scenario 2. The schemes that can achieve these outer

bounds are proposed and analyzed, respectively. Finally, we analyze the throughput-outage scaling law

considering the Zipf distribution under the conditions that  > 1 and that the maximum instantaneous

power can go to infinity with average user power remaining constant. This is to see whether allowing

the maximum instantaneous power going to infinity can allow us to break the (1) throughput limitation

in the physical model when the instantaneous power is upper bounded by some constant. However, the

result shows that this is not possible even though we allow the instantaneous power going to infinity with

the average user power still being some constant.

II. NETWORK MODEL

We consider a random dense network where users are placed according to a binomial point process

(BPP) within a unit square-shaped area [0, 1] × [0, 1]. Accordingly, we assume that the number of users

in the network is N, and users are distributed uniformly at random within the network. We assume each

device in the network can cache S files and each file has equal size. We consider a library consisting

of M files. We assume that users request the files from the library independently according to a request

distribution modeled by the MZipf distribution [11]:

Pr(f ; , q) =

(f + q)- M m=1(m + q)-

=

(f + q)- H(1, M, , q),

(1)

where  is the Zipf factor; q is the plateau factor of the distribution; and H(a, b, , q) :=

b f

=a(f

+

q)-

.

Note that the MZipf distribution degenerates to a Zipf distribution when q = 0. To simplify the notation,

we will in the remainder of this paper use Pr(f ) instead of Pr(f ; , q) as the short-handed expression. We

consider a decentralized random caching policy for all users [45], in which users cache files independently

according to the same caching policy. Denoting Pc(f ) as the probability that a user caches file f , the

caching policy is fully described by Pc(1), Pc(2), ..., Pc(M), where 0  Pc(f )  1, f ; thus users cache

files according to the caching policy {Pc(f )}M f=1. We consider

M f =1

Pc(f

)

=

S.

Then,

each

user

can

cache exactly S different files according to the caching mechanism provided in [45]. In this paper, we

assume that S and  are some constants.

We consider the asymptotic analysis in this paper, in which we assume that N   and M  .

We will restrict to M = o(N) and q = O(M) when  < 1; M = o(N) and q = o(M) when  > 1. The

main reason for restricting to M = o(N) when  < 1 is to let users of the network have sufficient ability

to cache the whole library. Similarly, the assumption that q = o(M) and M = o(N) when  > 1 can

give the users of the network a sufficient ability to cache the most popular q files (orderwise); otherwise

the outage probability would go to 1.

The plateau factor q can either go to infinity or remain constant. When q goes to infinity, it is sufficient

to consider q = O(M). This is because the MZipf distribution would behave like a uniform distribution

asymptotically as q = (M) and such case is less interesting because the concentration property of files

in this case is not captured and because this is equivalent to letting  very close to 0. Consequently, we

assume q = O(M) when  < 1. In addition, when  > 1, it is more interesting to consider the case that

q = o(M) because it gives a clear distinction between the heavy-tailed case ( < 1) and the light-tailed

case ( > 1), where the mathematical definition of a heavy-tailed popularity distribution can be found in

Definition 3 of [32]. Furthermore, in practical terms, we see from the measurement results [11] that q is

much smaller than M when  > 1, which supports the consideration of q = o(M). When q is a constant,

i.e., q = (1), the request distribution generally behaves like a Zipf distribution as M  . Thus, the

7

results for q = (1) can be representative for the analysis that uses the Zipf distribution for the request

distribution. We will consider q   in Secs. III and IV and consider q = (1) only in Sec. V.

We consider single-hop D2D communications for file delivery. We assume users can obtain their desired

files through only single-hop D2D communications and assume users always have requests to satisfy.

Note that we do not eliminate the possibility that a user can find the desired file from its own cache,

and such case can be accommodated by letting the distance between the TX and RX be much smaller

than the general D2D communication distance. However, we note that since S is some constant, the

probability that a user can find the desired file from its own cache goes to zero as q and M go to infinity.

Furthermore, as we would assume the link-rate for file delivery is upper bounded by the power of the

TX, the self-caching gain is indeed not significant in terms of asymptotic performance. Similar to [10],

we assume that different users making the requests on the same file would request different segments of

the file. This avoids the gain from naive multicasting.

We define an outage as an occurrence where a user cannot obtain its desired file from the D2D network.

Suppose we are given a realization of the placement of the user locations P according to the binomial

point process. In addition, we are given a realization of file requests F and a realization of file placement

G of users according to the popularity distribution Pr(·) and caching policy Pc(·), respectively. We can

define Tu as the throughput of user u  U under a feasible single-hop file delivery scheme. Therefore,

Tu is defined as:

Tu

=

1 T

T

Cu(t)Au(t),

(2)

t=1

where T is the number of time-slots for the transmission, Cu(t) is the link rate for user u in time-slot t, and Au(t) is the link activation indicator of user u at time-slot t, where Au(t) = 1 if the link of user u is scheduled at time-slot t; otherwise Au(t) = 0. We then define the average throughput of user u as T u = EP,F,G[Tu], where the expectation is taken over the placement of user locations P, file requests F of users, the file placement of users G, and the file delivery scheme. Finally, we define the average throughput of a user in the network as

T

=

min
uU

T

u.

(3)

When the number of users in the network is N, we define

No = 1{E[Tu | P, F, G] = 0}

(4)

uU

as the number of users that in outage, where 1{E[Tu | P, F, G] = 0} is the indicator function such that the value is 1 if E[Tu | P, F, G] = 0; otherwise the value is 0. Intuitively, 1{E[Tu | P, F, G] = 0} is equal to

8

zero when the file delivery scheme cannot deliver the desired file to user u. We note that the expectation

of E[Tu | P, F, G] is taken over the file delivery scheme. The outage probability is then defined as

A. Channel Model

We consider the generalized physical model in this paper. Suppose there is a TX-RX pair u, where user u serves as the TX and user u(r) serves as RX. We denote xu and xu(r) as the locations of user u and u(r), respectively, and denote uCo as the set of users transmitting in the same time-frequency resource. Assume that Pmax is the maximum power that a user can use for transmission. Then, the generalized physical model defines the link-rate of the TX-RX pair u as [19], [20]:

R(u, u(r)) = Bu log2

1+

Puluu(r)

where Bu is the bandwidth used for communication between users u and u(r); Pu  Pmax is the power

u(r),4

where

duu(r) = |xu - xu(r) |

(7)

is the distance between users u and u(r),  > 0 is some calibration factor, and  > 2 is the pathloss coefficient. Note that different from our conference version that provides dedicated analysis for both the bounded physical model and the generalized physical model, in this paper, we focus on the analysis of the generalized physical model. This is because the scaling laws derived in consideration of the bounded physical model can be treated as special cases for those derived for the generalized physical model (with the assumption that Pu is finite). Specifically, as indicated in [19], [20], for any configuration of TX-RX pairs, the differences between the link-rates of TX-RX pairs considering these two physical models are simply bounded by some finite constant when Pu, u are finite. Therefore, it is sufficient that we focus on the generalized physical model. Note that to obtain the rigourous derivations for the scaling laws with the bounded physical model, we can repeat the derivations in this paper and apply them to the bounded physical model after some modifications similar to the approach provided in [1].

4It should be noted that the adopted path gain model is an approximation of the realistic model, as it could violate the rationale that the transmit power is larger than the receive power in certain regime and that the pathloss coefficient should follow the free-space pathloss model in the near-field regime. Nevertheless, the adopted model can appropriately capture the relative power loss among different TX-RX pairs and provide high tractability. Therefore, this model is effective and useful as we can correctly interpret the derived results in consideration of the potentially unreasonable portions of the results which will be discussed in more detail later in this paper.

9

B. Targeting Scenarios
We in this paper consider two scenarios with different assumptions. Specifically, for each realization of the network, we assume (in the order-wise sense) either (i) all TX-RX pairs transmit the same number of bits in T  sec (e.g., users obtain the same amount of segments of files in T  sec) or (ii) different TX-RX pairs can transmit different numbers of bits in T  sec. Since the first assumption forces different TX-RX pairs in a network realization to have equal user throughput, we refer it to as "equal-throughput assumption". On the other hand, when the equal-throughput assumption is relaxed, i.e., when considering the second assumption, different TX-RX pairs of a network realization can have different throughput, indicating receptions of more bits are allowed for some users in the network realization. Note that although the second assumption would lead to Tu = Tv for some u = v, we still have T u = T v, u, v due to symmetry of the network. Hence, the unequal-throughput assumption considered in the second scenario is in the per realization sense, instead of the average sense. This implies that the unfairness happening for the second scenario is only in the realization level, and users are still statistically fair so that the optimal throughput with definition in (3) is non-trivial.
In the remainder of this paper, we will analyze the network with and without the equal-throughput assumption, where the first scenario, i.e., the scenario with the equal-throughput assumption, is denoted as scenario 1 and the second scenario is denoted as scenario 2.

III. THROUGHPUT-OUTAGE ANALYSIS FOR MZIPF DISTRIBUTION WITH  < 1

In this section, we analyze the throughput-outage performance for the case  < 1. We will first provide

the outer bound analysis for both scenarios introduced in Sec. II.B. Then, the achievable schemes and the

analyses corresponding to each scenario are provided. We start the analysis by providing Lemmas 1 and

2 which characterize the outage probability and by providing Theorem 1 which describes the transport

capacity upper bound.

Lemma 1 (Lemma 4 in [12]): When n = (M) users are uniformly distributed within a network with

unit size, the probability to have ND users within an area of size A = o

ND n

is upper bounded by o(1).

Lemma 2 (Lemma 5 in [12]): Suppose  < 1. Then, when a user in the network searches through

ns = o

M S

different users, we obtain pmiss(ns)  1 - o(1), where pmiss(ns) is the probability that the

user cannot find the desired file from the ns users. Furthermore, when a user in the network searches

through ns = M different users for some , we have the following results: (i) pmiss(ns)   e- if

 = (1) is large enough; and (ii) pmiss(ns)  (1 - )e-(S-) if  = (1).

Theorem 1: We denote the set of TX-RX pairs as  and define ru as the communication distance

for the TX-RX pair u. Let M  , N  , and q  . Suppose  < 1 and q = O(M). We

let R0 = 0

where

constant.

We

denote

the

transport

capacity

of

the

network

10

consisting of , defined in terms of meter-bits/s, as C = u ruCu, where Cu is the average rate (bits/s) of user u. We denote the set of TX-RX pairs which have the largest powers among the TX-RX pairs in their corresponding time-frequency resources as W. Under the generalized physical model, C is upper bounded as:

C



BCW

B C R0

+

B

log2(e) 0

SN M

  3 2+1

 + 2(2( 2 + 1))

,

(8)

where B is the total bandwidth of the network; CW is the average transport capacity efficiency, defined in terms of meter-bits per second per Hz, of the TX-RX pairs in W; CR0 is the average transport capacity efficiency of TX-RX pairs that are not in W and have communication distances smaller than R0. The definitions of CW and CR0 are formally given below (66) at the end of Appendix A.

Proof. See Appendix A.

Remark 1: From Lemmas 1 and 2, we conclude that to have a non-vanishing probability for a user to

obtain the desired file (i.e., pmiss(n) does not go to 1), with high probability, the distance between the

TX and RX is at least 

M SN

, where  = (1).

A. Outer Bound Analysis for Scenario 1

Here, we consider scenario 1 and provide the outer bound. Since the equal-throughput assumption is considered, different TX-RX pairs transmit the same number of bits in a time period of T  sec. With

Remark 1 and Theorem 1, we can obtain the following theorem: Theorem 2: Let M  , N  , and q  . Suppose  < 1. Assume that the powers of users
in the network are upper bounded by Pmax. When  = (1) is large enough, the throughput-outage performance of the network is dominated by:

B T (Po) =  N log2
Po =  e- ,

1 + Pmax N0Bs


M

SN

+ B log2(e)



 3 2+1

 + 2(2( 2 + 1))

S M

, (9)

where Po can be arbitrarily small or converging to zero.

Proof. See Appendix B.

Remark 2: Note that when N  , T (Po) can be unbounded because the term


 M

 2

in T (Po) in

SN

Theorem 2 can go to infinity. This unreasonable result is brought by having the cases that the signal-

to-interference-plus noise ratio (SINR) becomes unbounded due to the unbounded path gain. Thus, to

correctly interpret the result in Theorem 2, we should consider that the term


 M

 2

in T (Po) in Theorem

SN

11

2 is upper bounded by 1, which corresponds to the physical reality of the pathloss laws. Note that such

consideration applies to all results in the remainder of this paper.

Remark 3: Theorem 2 shows that when  < 1, M is the dominant factor while q does not impact the

asymptotic scaling law. In addition, it shows that when the maximum transmit power is some constant,

the throughput-outage performance outer bound considering the generalized physical model has the same

scaling law as the throughput-outage performance considering the protocol model [10], [11]. Note that

in contrast to the physical model here which enables the link-level power allocation and scheduling, the

protocol model and the approaches in [10], [11] only consider the simple clustering network and the

system-level changing of the cluster size. As a result, this indicates that the link-level power allocation

and scheduling cannot improve the throughput-outage scaling law, i.e., the asymptotic growth rate of the

throughput-outage performance, when requests of users are served with equal-throughput assumption.

That being said, in practice, the constant factor of the throughput-outage performance might still be

improved by a good power control and link scheduling approach.

Remark 4: Slightly different from Remark 3, when we allow the maximum instantaneous transmit power

to be infinity while the average power is still some constant, Theorem 2 suggests that the asymptotic

performance

might

be

improved

if

S M

=

o

log2(N ) N

. Such improvement could be possible if we let a

user to exclusively transmit with the power being (N) once every (N) time-slots. However, in this

case, it indicates that simple time-division multiple access (TDMA) can dominate the performance, and

thus the relevant discussion becomes trivial.

B. Outer Bound Analysis for the Proposed Throughput-Enhancing Approach in Scenario 2

From the result in Sec. III.A, we see that having link-level power allocation and scheduling cannot

improve the throughput-outage scaling law when the equal-throughput assumption is considered. To

break such limitation, we drop the equal-throughput assumption here and propose a throughput-enhancing

approach that can improve the scaling law by having link-level power allocation and scheduling. We

conduct the outer bound analysis for the proposed throughput-enhancing approach in this subsection. The

achievable performance for the throughput-enhancing approach will then be discussed later in Sec. III.D.

Since the equal-throughput assumption is dropped in this case, we can take advantage of letting the

TX-RX pairs with small communication distances transmit at a much higher rate to enhance the network

throughput. Based on this concept, we propose a double time-slot throughput-enhancing approach as

follows.

We

first

split

the

overall

transmission

period

T

into

two

time-slots;

each

has

the

duration

T 2

.

The first time-slot is used for the general file delivery which adopts the same approach as in scenario

1. We then use the second time-slot to enhance the overall throughput. To do this, we let TX-RX pairs 
with communication distances smaller than R0, where  = O(1), transmit with high throughput in

12

the second time-slot. Note that different users in the second time-slot are assumed to transmit with equal

throughput, but such throughput should be much larger than the throughput of users transmitting in the

first time-slot. In addition, the split of the overall transmission period into two equal time-slots does not

lose the optimality of the scaling law as compared to other time-slot splits using different fractions. This

is because the scaling law is to characterize the order gain, and we only have a constant factor gain even if we can magically allow the transmission durations for both time-slots to be extended to T , i.e., both time-slots occupy a duration of T  (which is not possible in reality as the overall transmission period is only T ). With the above described approach, we can obtain the following theorem that characterizes the

outer bound for the proposed double time-slot scheme:

Theorem 3: Let M

double time-slot framework discussed in Sec. III.B is used and the  = O(1) is selected. Assume that

Remark 5: By Theorem 3, we see that the concept of leveraging high-throughput transmissions of the TX-RX pairs with small distances can effectively enhance the overall throughput outer bound as our proposed double time-slot approach is realized with  = o(1). We stress that this is an outer bound for the proposed double time-slot scheme, while we make no claims about outer bounds for all possible transmission schemes. Therefore, it is likely that introducing the multiple (more than two) time-slot

13

approach might further enhance the throughput. However, as the performance enhancement ability is dependent on  and , and the characteristics of such performance enhancement ability are unclear,

we thus in this paper focus on studying the performance of the double time-slot framework, and the

investigations of the multiple time-slot framework are considered as possible future works.

We see from Theorem 3 that the network throughput T can be increased via decreasing . However,
due to the physical limitation, namely the TX-RX link feasibility, there is a lower bound on , leading
to an upper bound of the throughput. To find this upper bound, we in the following analyze . Note that
the first term of (10) is asymptotically irrelevant to  because we interpret   is upper bounded M 2 SN
by some constant according to Remark 2. Thus, the benefit of the first term of (10) comes only from

letting the transmission power go to infinity. It follows that we can without loss of generality focus on

the

BS 2 M

term when

characterizing

the lower bound of .

We

thus

in the

following assume

that

Pmax

is some constant for simplicity, and then derive the following Corollary:

Corollary 1: Following Theorem 3, when maximizing the number of users that can obtain the desired



files within the distance 

R0, namely when maximizing , the throughput for users with communication

distances being du  R0 is dominated by:

(13)

Proof. See Appendix D.

With Corollary 1, we can then derive the outer bound for the proposed throughput-enhancing approach. This is elaborated as follows. By using the same analysis as that for scenario 1, we first know that the throughput per user in the second time-slot leads to the following upper bound (see Appendix B for details):

With (14) and that Pmax is some constant, we obtain

2 = O

S M

(15)

Then, observe that if we want 2 to be less likely to hit its upper bound for a given , we shall maximize . Recall that the maximum is  =  (()1-) as indicated in Corollary 1. This along with that the TX-RX feasibility condition to satisfy is 2  , where  is some constant indicating that the link-rate

14

cannot be infinitely large, leads to that if we want to minimize  while maintaining the tightness of the

upper bound, we should have

Since  is some constant, this then lead to

(20)

Proof. This is directly obtained by using Theorem 3, Corollary 1, and (17).
Remark 6: By comparing between Theorem 2 and Theorem 4, we observe that the double time-slot approach can significantly improve the throughput performance without sacrificing the outage probability. The benefit is from that we judiciously let TX-RX pairs with very small communication distances transmit at a much higher throughput in the second time-slot. Note that here we implicitly assume that users have sufficient demands so that the only limitation for a user to increase its throughput is the link-rate. In

15

addition, we see that T2 = (B) is some constant if the maximum transmit power is some constant. This indicates that the TX-RX pairs with enhanced throughput satisfy the link-rate feasibility condition.
Remark 7: From Theorem 4, we observe that using the double time-slot approach indeed gives rise to some degree of unfairness, as for each network realization, the users allowed to transmit in the second time-slot can enjoy a much higher instantaneous throughput, though different users would have the same average throughput. Furthermore, as indicated by Theorem 4 that the network throughput T is independent of Po, the double time-slot framework can ultimately decouple the tradeoff between throughput and outage, and thus the throughput-outage tradeoff no longer exists in terms of the average user throughput. However, this is because the TX-RX pairs with small communication distances can maintain the overall network throughput when increasing  at the cost of introducing further unfairness, and thus the overall throughput-outage tradeoff has been converted to fairness-outage tradeoff in this context. Finally, we stress that the throughput-enhancing result here is not because we let TX-RX pairs with high throughput to transmit the same amount of information bits as those TX-RX pairs with low throughput, and then let them finish their transmissions fast so that the remaining amount of resource for other TX-RX pairs to transmit can be increased. On the other hand, the overall throughput is enhanced because the TX-RX pairs with high throughput indeed successfully transmit and receive much more information bits than those TX-RX pairs with low throughput in a given time period.

C. Achievable Scheme and Analysis for Scenario 1

Here, we provide the achievable scheme and its corresponding analysis for scenario 1. We consider the

following achievable scheme. Suppose the communications are in T  sec. We first split this T -second

period

into

two

time-slots;

each

has

T 2

sec.

Then,

in

the

first

time-slot,

all

N

users

in

the

network

are

served in a round-robin manner using time division multiple access (TDMA) approach, in which each

of them can

transmit with

the maximum power Pmax

in a period

of

T 2N

sec. In

the second time-slot, we

adopt the clustering network with the frequency reuse scheme and cluster-wise round-robin scheduling,

i.e., users in the same cluster are served in the round-robin manner and different clusters can be activated

simultaneously. The clustering approach used in the second time-slot is as follows. We split the network

into equally-sized square clusters whose side length is d = 

M SN

. We assume users in a cluster

can obtain the desired file only from users in the same cluster. In each cluster, a user is served at a time

and users in the same cluster are served in a round-robin manner. Interference between different clusters is avoided via the frequency reuse approach with reuse factor (2(K + 1))2, where K  N > 0 is a finite

positive integer. Then, by symmetry of the clusters and by the facts that N   and d = o(1), when

computing the outage probability, we can assume that clusters are independent to one another and that

the number of users Ncluster in a cluster follows the Poisson distribution, given as Ncluster  FPoi

M S

,

16

where

M S

is

the

mean

value

of

the

Poisson

distribution.

Note

that

the

latter

assumption is

because

the

binomial distribution converges to a Poisson distribution when the number of trials goes to infinity while

the probability of success goes to zero.

We use the randomized caching policy described in Sec. II. It follows from Lemma 1 in [12] that the

outage probability of the described network with clustering is

M

po =

Pr

(f

)e-

M S

Pc

(f

)

,

f =1

(21)

where Pc(f ), f are determined by the caching policy minimizing (21), as provided in Theorem 1 of [12]. With the aforementioned transmission and caching policies, users in the network are served by

the combination of two types of delivery approaches, i.e., the simple TDMA in the first time-slot and

the clustering in the second time-slot. Note that the split here is not to enable the throughput-enhancing

approach introduced in Sec. III.B as scenario 1 is considered here. On the contrary, it is simply used

for achieving the outer bound in Sec. III.A. To derive the achievable throughput-outage performance, we

start with the following proposition:

Proposition 1: Suppose the clustering network is considered with the frequency reuse approach adopting the reuse factor (2(K + 1))2, where K  N > 0 is some finite positive integer. Assume that the powers

of users in the network are upper bounded by some constant upp = (1) and lower bounded by some constant low = (1), i.e., low  Pu  upp, u. Then, when each cluster at most activates a single user in the cluster for transmission at a time, there must exist some constant  such that for any activated

TX-RX pair u, we obtain

R(u, u(r)) = Bu log2

1 + BuN0 +

Puluu(r) P l k=u,kuCo k ku(r)

 Bu log2(1 + ),

(22)

where

Bu

=

B (2(K +1))2

and



is

monotonically

increasing

with

respect

to

the

reuse

factor

K.

Proof. See Appendix E.

Proposition 1 indicates that by using the proposed clustering with frequency reuse scheme, users in

different clusters are guaranteed to have some constant link-rate. Then, by combining the transmissions

in the first and second time-slots and leveraging Proposition 1, we obtain the following theorem:

Theorem 5: Let M  , N  , and q  . Suppose  < 1 and q = O(M). Assume that the

powers of users in the network are upper bounded by Pmax. Consider the caching policy in Theorem 1 of

[12] and that the side length of a cluster is

M SN

.

Assume

equal-throughput

transmissions

users.

When

 = (1) is large enough, the following throughput-outage performance of the network is achievable:

T (Po) =

M 2

+

BS M

, Po =  e- ,

(23)

17
where Po can be negligibly small or converging to zero. Proof. See Appendix F.
Remark 8: By comparing between Theorems 2 and 5, we see that the proposed outer bound is achievable. This indicates that when the equal-throughput assumption is considered, the simple clustering scheme is asymptotically optimal even though we are allowed to use the link-level power allocation and scheduling.

D. Achievable Scheme and Analysis for Scenario 2 with the Proposed Throughput-Enhancing Approach

Here, an achievable scheme for scenario 2 is presented and analyzed. The achievable scheme for

scenario 2 is a combination of the achievable scheme for scenario 1 and the double time-slot throughput-

enhancing approach introduced in Sec. III.B. Thus, for the achievable scheme here, by following the

throughput-enhancing approach, we first split the transmission duration T  sec into two time-slots; each

has

T 2

sec.

We

assume

without

loss

of

generality

that

S

is

an

even

number.

Then,

in

the

first

time-slot,

the achievable scheme proposed for scenario 1 in Sec. III.C is directly used, where cluster size in this

case is set to d1 =

M SN

.

In

the

second

time-slot,

we

also

consider

the

achievable

scheme

proposed

for

scenario 1 in Sec. III.C. However, in this case, the side length of the cluster is changed to d2 =

M SN

,

where  = O(1). By the above descriptions, we observe that the achievable scheme in Sec. III.C is used

twice, and each has a dedicated cluster size for realizing the clustering approach used in each time-slot.

For the caching scheme, we also split the whole cache space into two subspaces, and each has size

S 2

.

For

the

first

caching

subspace,

we

consider

the

caching

policy

proposed

in

Theorem

1

of

[12]

with

gc,1(M )

=

2M S

.

For

the

second

caching

subspace,

we

consider

again

the

same

caching

policy

and

let

gc,2(M )

=

2M S

.

By

the

above

described

transmission

and

caching

policies,

we

can

then

obtain

the

following theorem which characterizes the achievable performance:

Proof. See Appendix G.
Remark 9: By comparing between Theorems 4 and 6, we see that the proposed outer bound is achievable. However, different from scenario 1 where the optimality can be achieved without resorting to link-level power control and scheduling, the achievable scheme of scenario 2 exploits the link-level power control and scheduling to enhance the throughput of users in the second time-slot so that the overall throughput is increased. Note that the use of different cluster sizes for different time-slots implies that power control and scheduling are used in link-level such that TX-RX pairs scheduled in different time-slots can follow the required cluster size and scheduling. This indicates that the link-level power control and scheduling can significantly improve the network throughput at the cost of some degree of fairness.

IV. THROUGHPUT-OUTAGE ANALYSIS FOR MZIPF DISTRIBUTION WITH  > 1

In this section, we analyze the throughput-outage performance considering  > 1 and q = o(M).

Similar to Sec. III, we will in this section first derive the outer bounds for scenario 1 and scenario

2 with the throughput-enhancing approach, and then provide the achievable schemes along with the

corresponding throughput-outage performance analysis. We start the analysis by providing Lemma 3 and

Theorem 7 which characterize the outage probability lower bound and the transport capacity upper bound,

respectively.

Lemma 3 (Lemma 8 in [12]): Suppose  > 1. Considering q = o(M), we have the following results: (i)

when a user searches through ns = o

q S

different users in the network, we obtain pmiss(n)  1-o(1); and

(ii)

when

a

user

searches

through

ns =

1 q S

<

M S

different

users,

where

1

=  (1)

but

1

=O

1
q -1

,

we obtain pmiss(n)  

1 (1 ) -1

.

19

Theorem 7: We denote the set of TX-RX pairs as  and define ru as the communication distance for

the TX-RX pair u. Let M   and N  . Suppose  > 1 and 1 q = o(M). We let R0 = 0

, 1q
SN

where 0 is some small constant. We denote the transport capacity of the network consisting of ,

defined in terms of meter-bits/s, as C = u ruCu, where Cu is the average throughput (bits/s) of

user u. We denote the set of TX-RX pairs which have the largest powers among the TX-RX pairs in

their corresponding time-frequency resources as W. Under the generalized physical model, C is upper

bounded as:

C



BCW

+

BC R0

+

B log2(e) 0

SN 1 q



 3 2+1

 + 2(2( 2 + 1))

,

(27)

where B is the total bandwidth of the network; CW is the average transport capacity efficiency, defined in
terms of meter-bits per second per Hz, of the TX-RX pairs in W; CR0 is the average transport capacity efficiency of TX-RX pairs that are not in W and have communication distances smaller than R0 . The definitions of CW and CR0 are formally given below (107) at the end of Appendix H.
Proof. This can be proved by following the same procedure as in Appendix A. We thus only illustrate

the proof in Appendix H, while some details are omitted for brevity.

Remark 10: By using Lemma 3, we conclude that to have a non-vanishing probability for a user to

obtain the desired file (i.e., pmiss(n) does not go to 1), with high probability, the distance between the

TX and RX is at least 

1 q SN

, where 1 = (1) and 1 = O

1
q -1

.

A. Outer Bound Analysis for Scenario 1

In scenario 1, we assume equal-throughput for users. Then, by following the same procedure as in

Sec. III.A and considering Theorem 7 and Remark 10, we can obtain the following theorem:

Theorem 8: Let M  , N  , and q  . Suppose  > 1 and 1 q = o(M). Assume that

the powers of users in the network are upper bounded by Pmax. When 1 = (1) is large enough and

1 = O

1
q -1

, the throughput-outage performance of the network is dominated by:

Po =

.

(28)

where Po can be arbitrarily small or converging to zero.

Proof. The proof can be done by directly using Lemma 3 and Theorem 7 and following the similar proof of proving Theorem 2. We thus omit the proof for brevity.

20

Remark 11: Theorem 8 shows that when  > 1, q is the dominant factor. In addition, similar to Remark 3, it shows that when the maximum transmit power is some constant, the throughput-outage performance bound considering the generalized physical model has the same scaling law as that considering the protocol model [11]. As a result, this again indicates that the link-level power allocation and scheduling cannot improve the asymptotic throughput-outage performance when users are served under equal-throughput assumption.

B. Outer Bound Analysis for the Proposed Throughput-Enhancing Approach in Scenario 2

In this subsection, we consider scenario 2, where the network is not confined to the equal-throughput

assumption. Similar to the case with  < 1, we can benefit from letting TX-RX pairs with small com-

munication distances to transmit with a much higher throughput. Hence, we again adopt the throughput-

enhancing approach proposed in Sec. III.B, where the first time-slot is used for ordinary file delivery and

the second time-slot is used to enhance the overall throughput by letting TX-RX pairs with communication 
distances smaller than R0 , where  = O(1), transmit with high speed. By adopting the proposed

throughput-enhancing approach, we can obtain the following theorem:

Theorem 9: Let M  , N  , and q  . Suppose  > 1 and 1 q = o(M). Suppose the double

time-slot approach discussed in Sec. III.B is used and the  = O(1) is selected. Assume that the powers

of users in the network are upper bounded by Pmax. When 1 = (1) is large enough, 1 = O

21

Proof. See Appendix I.
By Theorem 9, we understand that minimizing  can maximize the overall network throughput. However, there is also a lower bound on  due to the physical limitation of the link-rate. The feasibility condition we need to satisfy is again given as:

2  ,

(32)

where  is some constant. Then, notice that by using Theorem 7, the throughput per user in the second

time-slot satisfies

and that Pmax is some constant. It follows that we have

(34)

Then, by the derivations in Appendix I and by using the same arguments as in Sec. III.B, we know from

(115) that

should be adopted. It follows that we must have

(1 ) =

(36)

if we want to minimize  subject to the feasibility condition and the tightness of the upper bound. Since

 is some constant, this then leads to

Finally, by using Theorem 9 and (37), we obtain the following theorem:

Proof. This is directly obtained by applying (37) to Theorem 9.
Remark 12: Similar to Remarks 6 and 7, we observe that the double time-slot approach can significantly improve the throughput performance without sacrificing the outage probability. The benefit is again from that we judiciously let TX-RX pairs with very small communication distances transmit at a much higher throughput in the second time-slot. In addition, as indicated by Theorem 10, the double time-slot approach again decouples the tradeoff between throughput and outage and converts the throughput-outage tradeoff to the fairness-outage tradeoff.

C. Achievable Scheme and Analysis for Scenario 1

Now, we provide the achievable scheme and its corresponding analysis for scenario 1, in which the

equal-throughput assumption is considered. We consider the achievable scheme similar to that in Sec. III.C, which is as follows. We first equally split the transmission period T  into two equally-sized time-

slots. Then, we let the transmissions in first time-slot follow the TDMA approach and let the transmissions

in second time-slot follow the clustering approach. Specifically, for the clustering, we split the network

into equally-sized square clusters in which the side length of each cluster is d = 

1 q SN

. Users in a

cluster can only obtain its desired file through users in the same cluster. In each cluster, a user is served

at a time and users in the same cluster are served in a round-robin manner. Interference between different clusters are avoided via the frequency reuse approach with reuse factor (2(K + 1))2, where K  N > 0

is a finite positive integer. Then, by symmetry of the clusters and by the fact that N   and that

d = o(1), we can follow the same arguments in Sec. III.C such that the number of users in a cluster is

23

given as Ncluster  FPoi

1 q S

, where

1 q S

is the mean value of the Poisson distribution. It follows again

by Lemma 1 in [12], the outage probability is

where Pc(f ), f are determined by the caching policy provided in Theorem 1 of [12]. With the above

clustering and caching policy, the same scheduling approach as in Sec. III.C is adopted, and we thus can

obtain the following theorem:

Theorem 11: Let M  , N  , and q  . Suppose that  > 1 and that q = o(M). Assume

that the powers of users in the network are upper bounded by Pmax. Consider the caching policy in

Theorem 1 of [12] and that the side length of a cluster is

1q SN

,

where



1 q S

= o(M). Assume equal-

throughput transmissions of users. When 1 = (1) is large enough and 1 = O

where Po can be negligibly small or converging to zero.

Proof. See Appendix K.

Remark 13: By comparing between Theorems 8 and 11, we see that the proposed outer bound is achievable. This indicates that when the equal-throughput assumption is considered, the simple clustering scheme is asymptotically optimal even though we are allowed to use the link-level power allocation and scheduling.

D. Achievable Scheme and Analysis for Scenario 2 with Throughput-Enhancing Approach

Here, the achievable scheme and the corresponding analysis for scenario 2 are provided. We consider

the achievable scheme having the same framework as that in Sec. III.D. Therefore, we again split the

transmission

duration

T

into

two

time-slots;

each

has

the

duration

of

T 2

.

We

assume

without

loss

of

generality that S is an even number. Then, in the first timeslot, we adopt the clustering with side length

d1 =

1 q SN

;

in

the

second

timeslot,

we

adopt

the

clustering

with

side

length

d2

=

1 q SN

,

where



=

O(1).

For the caching scheme, we split the whole cache space into two subspace, in which each subspace

has

size

S 2

.

For

the

first

caching

subspace,

we

consider

the

caching

policy

proposed

in

Theorem

1

of

[12]

with

gc,1(M )

=

21 S

q

;

for

the

second

caching

subspace,

we

adopt

the

same

caching

policy

and

let

gc,2(M )

=

21 S

q

.

By

the

above

described

scheme,

we

can

then

obtain

the

following

theorem:

Theorem 12: Let M  , N  , and q  . Suppose that  > 1 and that q = o(M). Assume that

the powers of users in the network are upper bounded by Pmax. Suppose the proposed achievable scheme

24

in Sec. IV.D is used and that the  is selected such that 1 =

. Then, when 1 = (1) is

large enough, the following throughput-outage performance of the network is achievable:

(45)

Proof. See Appendix L.

Remark 14: By comparing between Theorems 10 and 12, we see that the proposed outer bound is

achievable. Similar to Remark 9, the achievable scheme of scenario 2 requires the link-level power control

and scheduling to enhance the overall throughput. In addition, we stress that although the throughput

scaling law 

S q

of scenario 2 gives the same scaling law as the scaling law of the multi-hop cache-

aided D2D networks derived in [12], we should not misinterpret that the single-hop cache-aided D2D

with link-level power control and scheduling can have the same performance as the multi-hop cache-

aided D2D. This is because comparing our result here with the result derived in [12] is slightly unfair

as [12] indeed provides the scaling law considering the equal-throughput assumption. In other word, the

single-hop cache-aided D2D with link-level power control and scheduling can have the same performance

as its multi-hop counterpart only if the unfairness (from the realization level) is introduced, while the

fairness is retained in the multi-hop case.

25

V. THROUGHPUT-OUTAGE ANALYSIS FOR ZIPF DISTRIBUTION WITH  > 1

In this section, we consider the analysis for networks considering the Zipf distribution, i.e., q = 0 or

equivalently q = (1). We note that since M is dominant in the case of  < 1, we are not interested

in the case that  < 1 for the Zipf distribution as the case of Zipf distribution with  < 1 should have

the same throughput-outage scaling law as that of the MZipf distribution with  < 1. On the other hand,

we are interested in the case that  > 1 for the Zipf distribution only when Pmax   is allowed with

Pmax N

=

O(1).

This

is

because

we

already

know

that

when

Pmax

is

some

constant,

the

throughput

per

user is also upper bounded by some constant, and such scaling law has already been achieved without

resorting to the link-level power control and scheduling in the literature [11]. Hence, we in this section

only focus on whether allowing instantaneous power to be infinity while confining the average power

to

be

constant,

i.e.,

Pmax





with

Pmax N

=

O(1),

can

bring

additional

performance

gain.

Since

we

can

consider  > 1 and q = (1) for deriving the scaling law for the Zipf case, we indeed can use the same

procedure of proving Theorems 8 and 11 while considering q = (1). This then leads to the following

theorem:

Theorem 13: Let M   and N  . Suppose that  > 1 and q = (1). Consider the equal-

throughput assumption. When 2 = (1) is large enough, the optimal throughput-outage performance of the network is:







T (Po)

=

+

Pmax N0 Bs
N



( )1 2 1 SN

  2
 +  

BS 2

, Po = zip(2 ),

(46)





where zip(2 ) can be arbitrarily small.

Proof. The proof simply follows the procedure for proving Theorems 8 and 11. We thus omit the proof for brevity.

By Remark 2, we understand that



( )1 2 1 SN

 should be upper bounded by 1. Therefore, from Theorem
2

13, we observe that the throughput per user is:





T

(Po)

=



B 
2

log2

1 + Pmax N0 Bs N

+

BS 2

.

(47)

Then,

since

we

know

1 N

log2 (Pmax)



0

when

Pmax N

=

O(1),

we

obtain

the

following

corollary:

26

Corollary 2: Let M   and N  . Suppose that  > 1 and q = (1). Consider the equal-

throughput assumption and

Pmax N

=

O(1). When 2

=

(1) is large enough, the throughput-outage

performance of the network is dominated by:

T (Po) = 

BS 2

, Po = zip(2 ),

(48)

where Po = zip(2 ) can be arbitrarily small.

From Corollary 2, we understand that even if we allow the instantaneous power to be infinity while still

confining the average power to be some constant, the best average throughput per user is some constant

with the outage probability being arbitrarily small. However, since such throughput-outage performance

can be achieved without letting the instantaneous power go to infinity, we conclude the following remark:

Remark 15: When considering Zipf distribution with  > 1, even if we allow the instantaneous power

to be infinity while still confining to that the constant average power, the throughput-outage performance

cannot be improved by the capability of having infinite instantaneous power. Therefore, there is no need

to let the instantaneous power to be infinity. In practice, this implies that the network is an interference-

limited network, which is in line with our expectation.

Remark 16: Although the conclusion in Remark 15 is derived assuming the scenario 1, such conclusion

applies to scenario 2. This is because it is not possible to obtain an order gain by letting TX-RX pairs

with (orderwise) smaller distances to transmit with much higher throughput as the number of TX-RX

pairs with (orderwise) smaller distances goes to zero when considering the Zipf distribution with  > 1.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS
This paper investigated the throughput-outage scaling laws of cache-aided single-hop D2D networks considering the generalized physical channel. The main purpose of this paper was to understand whether and how including link-level power control and scheduling can improve the scaling laws. Results showed that when the equal-throughput assumption is considered, i.e., users are served fairly in the realization level, having link-level power control and scheduling cannot improve the performance asymptotically. On the other hand, if the equal-throughput assumption is dropped, i.e., we allow users to have different throughput at the realization level, the scaling laws indeed can be significantly improved by appropriately using link-level power control and scheduling, and then letting TX-RX pairs with small communication distances to transmit at high speed. These results indicated that the approach to benefit from link-level power control and scheduling is to discriminate between TX-RX pairs with different communication distances in the link-level such that the throughput of TX-RX pairs with small communication distances can be significantly enhanced, leading to the asymptotic improvement for the throughput of the network.
Although this paper has conducted the analysis to certain extent, there still remain some possible future directions. First of all, we in this paper focuses only on the double time-slot approach for

27
throughput enhancement in scenario 2, i.e., we only distinguish the TX-RX pairs into two types by their communication distances. Clearly, such approach might be extended to considering more than two types of TX-RX pairs, and whether such extension can bring further performance gain is unclear. Besides, our results are derived under the assumption that users are uniformly distributed within the network. Therefore, our analysis can only be considered as the statistically worst-case analysis, and different scaling laws might be derived if different user distribution assumptions are considered.

APPENDIX A PROOF OF THEOREM 1

Proof. Suppose that the delivery are implemented within a period of T  sec The T -second duration is split into different time-slots, in which the duration of a time-slot is  sec. We also assume that the total bandwidth B is equally split into H different sub-channels. We denote the bandwidth of a sub-channel as Bs and denote the set of TX-RX pairs that transmit in sub-channel s and time-slot t as st. Assume Pmax is the maximum power that a user can use for transmission; Bs. Then, note that a TX-RX pair might be scheduled in more than a time-frequency resource. Then, the total transport capacity for TX-RX pairs in sub-channel s in time-slot t, defined in bit-meters, is:

We

denote

as

and

would

like

to

compute

it.

To

do

this,

we

consider

st = st \ {wst} and categorize TX-RX pairs in st into different sets according to their communication

distances. Specifically, we let Rj = 0

and

define:

Rst0 = {u : ru < R0, u  st}; (50)
Rstj = {u : Rj-1  ru < Rj, u  st}, j > 0.

28

Then,

we

can

describe

C st

as

We now want to compute

CRj =

ru loge 1 +

uRstj

Puluu(r) P l kst,k=u k ku(r)

, j > 0.

(52)

To do this, we split the network into equally-sized square clusters whose size length is Rj. Then, we collect all clusters that contain at least one RX of the TX-RX pairs in Rstj and denote the set of such

clusters

as

j .

Consequently,

|j |

We

denote

the

as

where

and

denote the number of RXs located in jg as njg. We denote the communication distance corresponding to

RX hjg in jg as rgjh; denote the transmit power of the TX corresponding to RX hjg in jg as Pgjh, where

h = 1, 2, ..., njg; denote Igjh as the total interference at RX hjg in jg; and let the indices of the RXs in jg

follow the descending order of the transmit powers of their corresponding TX, i.e, Pgjh  Pgjh, h > h.

Then, we know:

We start computing (53) by first computing (a) in it. To do this, without loss of generality, we assume

Pgj1  Pgj1 if g < g. We define djg = min

 { 2}  {|x1jg - x1jg | : 1  g  |j|, g = g, g < g} . Then,

it

should

be

that 

wst,

which

is

the

has

the

power

in

must

be

located

within a distance of 2 from any receiver 1jg, g. Therefore, according to the definition of djg, for RX 1jg,

there must be a TX located within a distance of djg from it. Moreover, such a TX must have a transmit

power that is at least as large as Pgj1. This thus leads to

Igj1

To proceed, we provide Lemmas 4 and 5 as following:

Proof. This is obtained by directly applying Lemma 4.2 in [19].

Lemma 5: When x > 0 and   1, we have loge(1 + x)  x. Proof. loge(1 + x)  loge ((1 + x)) =  loge(1 + x)  x.

From (54), we can upper bound (a) in (53) as:

(58)

After obtaining the upper bound for (a) of (53), we now upper bound (b) of (53). We define

njg

Pgj =

Pgjh.

h=1

(59)

Then, we observe that when we consider only TXs whose RXs are within the same cluster of receiver 
u(r), the distances between those RXs and RX u(r) must be upper bounded by 2Rj + Rj, where the first term is because the largest distance between any receive in the same cluster is 2Rj and the second

30

term is because the the communication distance of the TX-RX pair in Rstj is upper bounded by Rj. Consequently, the interference Igjh of a receiver must be lower bounded as:

Igjh



(Pgj

Pgjh)

 ( 2Rj +

(60)

Furthermore, since we have Pgj1  Pgjh, h  2, we know Pgj  2Pgjh, h  2 leading to Pgj - Pgjh

By

is the average transport capacity of the TX-RX pairs that do not have the largest powers among their corresponding time-frequency resource and have communication distance smaller than R0.

APPENDIX B PROOF OF THEOREM 2

To have a negligibly small outage probability, according to Remark 1, we need TX-RX pairs to have

communication distances ru =

with high probability, where  = (1). This indicates that

the average distance of a bit that is transported in the network is L = 

M SN

. From (8), we first

observe that the upper bound can be optimized by maximizing CW and CR0 . When optimizing CW , we aim to have larger rw, w  W. In addition, we know that, w.h.p., the communication distances

of users are ru = O

Recall that, w.h.p., the communication distances of TX-RX pairs is

and  is small when 0

is small. Thus, (1 - 0) should be some constant. Then, from (74) and Lemma 2, we complete the proof.

Subsequently, since we delivery files only for those TX-RX pairs whose communication distances are 
smaller than du = R0, where  = O(1), by using the same analysis as for scenario 1, we can obtain

the throughput per user in the second time-slot satisfies:

(77) where the outage lower bound is Po =  e- . Since  = O(1), we notice that in this case  is dominated by the second term, implying that the overall network throughput is enhanced by the throughput generated in the second time-slot, while the outage probability is maintained low by the transmissions in the first time-slot. The above discussions then lead to Theorem 3.

34

APPENDIX D PROOF OF COROLLARY 1

Observe that  can make an impact on 2, and 2 can characterize the upper bound of the throughputenhancing ability. Hence, we need to characterize  to better characterize 2. To do this, we need to obtain the maximal probability that users can obtain their desired files from users within the distance of 
R0. This is equivalent to finding the minimal outage probability within a cluster whose side length is  R0 . Then, by Proposition 2 of [12], we know that the minimal outage probability in this case is

(78) can be written as

(79)

It follows that maximal probability for a user to find its desired file from users within the distance of

pshec =

(80)

This leads to

 =  ()1- .

(81)

Combining Theorem 3 and (81), we complete the proof.

APPENDIX E PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1
Proof. By the using frequency reuse scheme with reuse factor (2(K + 1))2 to avoid the inter-cluster interference, interference for a TX in a specifc cluster comes from users in other clusters that transmit at the same frequency. We then notice that (see Fig. 4 in [21]) the closest TXs causing interference is located in a square at distance at least K +1 clusters away. Specifically, the closet ring of the 8 interfering

35

TXs are K + 1 clusters away; the second closest ring of the 16 interfering TXs are at least (3K + 3)

clusters away. Overall, the upper bound of the total interference power can be summarized as following:

I(d, K) 



8iupp (d(2i

 - 1)(K

+ 1))

=

8upp (d(K + 1))



i (2i - 1)

i=1

i=1



8upp (d(K + 1))

i1-.

(82)

i=1

i=1

We denote

 i=1

i1-

as

Ic,

which

clearly

converges 

when



>

2.

Then,

since

the

distance

between

the

TX and the RX in the same cluster is at most 2d, we know that

S(d)  low .

(83)

( 2d)

By observing (82) and (83), we then conclude that the SINR of a D2D link in a cluster is:

(85)

is lower bounded by some constant  and is monotonically increasing with respect to K. Furthermore,

since the minimum transmit power is some constant, there must exist some constant  such that

It

follows

that

for

any

pair

there

Note

that

increasing

with

respect

to

the

factor

as

(85)

is monotonically increasing with respect to K. This completes the proof.

APPENDIX F PROOF OF THEOREM 5

Proof. We first derive the outage probability. Note that the number of users Ncluster in a cluster follows

the

Poisson

distribution

whose

mean

value

is

M S

.

Then,

according

to

Proposition

1

of

[12],

when



is

sufficiently large, the outage probability is upper bounded as

po   e- ,

(87)

indicating that the outage probability can be negligibly small or converging to zero. Furthermore, since

the

mean

number

of

users

in

a

cluster

is

M S



and

p0

is

either

negligibly small or

converging

to

36

zero, we can conclude that for each cluster, the probability that all users are in outage goes to zero; thus the probability that a cluster can have at least a TX-RX pair to schedule goes to 1.
Now, we derive the network throughput. We first note that due to symmetry of the clusters and due to that users in a cluster are served in a round-robin manner, the proposed achievable scheme satisfies the equal-throughput assumption. Then, for the first time-slot, since the simple TDMA is used for users, the achievable network throughput of the first time-slot is:

Tnet,1 = B log2

1 + Pmax N0B



M 2

SN

(88)

Subsequently, recall that by Proposition 1 in Sec. III.C, any TX-RX pair in a cluster can be activated

with an appropriate K. Thus, for the second sub-timeslot, since the number of clusters in the network is

at least

SN M

, by symmetry of clusters, the network throughput can be obtained as follows:





  SN M

Tnet,2



E

 

Tc =

SN M

· E [Tc] ,

(89)

c=1

where Tc is the link-rate of cluster c in the second time-slot. Since the probability that a cluster can have

at least a TX-RX link to schedule goes to 1 and any scheduled TX-RX link can provide at least the the

rate

B (2(K +1))2

log2 (1 + )

according

to

Proposition

1,

it

follows

that

the

throughput

generated at the second time-slot is

Tnet,2

B (2(K +

Due to symmetry of users and by using (88) and (90), the overall achievable throughput per user is

APPENDIX G PROOF OF THEOREM 6

Recall

that

we

split

the

whole

cache

space

into

two

subspaces,

and

each

has

size

S 2

.

For

the

first

caching

subspace, we consider the cluster size d1 =

M SN

and

adopt

the caching

policy proposed

in

Theorem

1

37

of

[12]

with

gc,1(M )

=

2M S

.

Thus,

by

using

Theorem

5,

the

achievable

throughput-outage

performance

for users receiving files in the first time-slot is given as:

T1(Po) = 

1 N

log2

1 + Pmax N0B


2M

 2

+

BS 2M

, Po =  e- .

(93)

SN

Then, for the second caching subspace, we adopt the caching policy proposed in Theorem 1 of [12] and

let

gc,2(M )

=

2M S

.

Note

that

since

we

let

d2

=

2M SN

in the second time-slot, the overall probability

that a user can find their desired in the cluster is lower bounded by the corresponding probability that

only the second caching subspace is considered. Then, according to Proposition 2 of [12] and derivations

in Sec. III.B, when q = O



M S

, such probability is given by (80), where

pshec  (()1- ).

(94)

Then, supposing

1

 = 

S 2- ,

(95)

M

the average number of users in a cluster that can find the desired files in the second time-slot is lower

bounded by



2M S

pshec

=  (1) ,

(96)

1

which can be a large constant if we let  in (95) to have a large constant factor, namely,  = Csec

S M

, 2-

where Csec is a large constant. It follows that the probability of activating a cluster with side length

d2 =

2M SN

can

be

close to

1.

Then, note that we have

1 d22

=

NS 2M

(97)

number of such cluster. Besides, by Proposition 1, we know the link-rate can be B log2(1 + ), where  is some constant. It follows that the network throughput in the second time-slot can be given as



BNS 2M

.

(98)

Since the number of users in the network that can receive files in the second time-slot is

N pshec =  N ()1- ,

(99)

38

the throughput per user for users that can receive files in the second time-slot is

performance. To do this, similar to the approach of proving Corollary 1, we first need to obtain the 
maximal probability that users can obtain their desired files from users within the distance of R0 . This is equivalent to finding the minimal outage probability within a cluster whose side length is  R0 . Then, by Proposition 3 of [12], we know that the minimal outage probability in this case is

the

the

and

the

is

either

negligibly

or

APPENDIX L PROOF OF THEOREM 12

For the first caching subspace, we consider the caching policy proposed in Theorem 1 of [12] with

gc,1(M )

=

21 S

q

.

Then,

for

the

second

caching

subspace,

we

adopt

the

caching

policy

proposed

in

Theorem

1

of

[12]

and

let

gc,2(M )

=

21 S

q

.

Therefore,

by

using

Theorem

11

with

d1

=

1 q SN

,

we

obtain

the

achievable throughput-outage performance for first time-slot as:

T1(Po) =

,

(124)

where Po can be negligibly small or converging to zero. Note that since we let d2 =

21q SN

in

the

second

timeslot, the probability that a user can find their desired in the cluster is lower bounded by the cache-hit

probability when considering the second caching subspace. Then, according to Proposition 3 of [12] and

derivations in Appendix I, the cache-hit probability pshec is given by (114), where

pshec = 

1 

.

(125)

Then, by letting

1 = 

1
S2 ,
q

(126)

the average number of users that can find the desired files in a cluster with side length d2 =

given as



21q S

pshec

21q SN

is

(127)

which can be very large if we let (126) to have a large constant factor, namely, 1 = Csec

S q

2 , where

Csec is a large constant. Hence, the probability of activating a cluster with side length d2 =

21q SN

can

be close to 1. Then, since we have

number of clusters, by Proposition 1, the total throughput in the second time-slot is

(129)

Note that the number of users that can receive files in the second time-slot is

(130)

It follows that the throughput per user for users that can receive files in the second time-slot is

Finally, by using
