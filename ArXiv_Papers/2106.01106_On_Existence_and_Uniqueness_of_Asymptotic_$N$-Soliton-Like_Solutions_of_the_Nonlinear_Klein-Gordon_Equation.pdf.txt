ON EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS OF ASYMPTOTIC -SOLITON-LIKE SOLUTIONS OF THE NONLINEAR KLEIN-GORDON EQUATION

. We are interested in solutions of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NLKG) in R1+ ,

 1, which behave as a soliton or a sum of solitons in large time. In the spirit of other articles

focusing on the supercritical generalized Korteweg-de Vries equations and on the nonlinear Schrödinger

equations, we obtain an -parameter family of solutions of (NLKG) which converges exponentially fast

to a sum of given (unstable) solitons. For = 1, this family completely describes the set of solutions

converging to the soliton considered; for  2, we prove uniqueness in a class with explicit algebraic

rate of convergence.

(NLKG)

Moreover, the structure of the equation is left invariant under the action of R × R by (time and
space) translation, and under the action of the Lorentz group (1, ) which consists of the linear automorphisms of R1+ that preserve the quadratic form ( , 1, . . . , )  2 - =1 2. In other words, precising this latter action, for all  R with R -euclidean norm | | < 1 and :=  1 ,

in the canonical basis of R1+ . We observe in particular that

 ( , ) = ( ( - ), ( - ))

if = 1. We refer to [8] for further details concerning the Lorentz transformations in all dimensions.

It is well-known that (NLKG) admits a family of solitons indexed by two parameters: the velocity
parameter  R with | | < 1 and the translation parameter 0  R . Let denote the unique (up to translation) positive 1 solution of the following stationary elliptic problem, associated with
(NLKG):

(1.1)

 - + ( )=0

which we take as radial; for the record, existence of follows from a standard result of Berestycki
and Lions [1] due to (H2) or (H'1) and uniqueness has been proved in Kwong [16] (in the case where ( ) = | | -1 is the particular power nonlinearity) and in Serrin and Tang [26]. We recall that
and its partial derivatives up to order 3 decay exponentially. Then for all  R such that | | < 1, for all 0  R , the boosted ground state

, 0 : ( , ) 

  ( , - 0) ,

where :=  1 and is the canonical projection R1+  R on the last coordinates, is a
1- | |2
solution of (NLKG) known as soliton. In the one-dimensional case, this soliton rewrites

, 0 : ( , )  ( - - 0) .
Soliton theory concerning (NLKG) has extensively been studied in many articles. One major result is linked to the classification of the solutions with energy near that of the ground state. Dynamics of the solutions of (NLKG) on the threshold energy ( ) = ( ) has been investigated in Duyckaerts and Merle [9]. More generally, classification of the solutions with energy less than a quantity slightly larger than the energy of the ground state has been done by Nakanishi and Schlag [24] and by Krieger, Nakanishi and Schlag [15].
Let us also mention that solitons of (NLKG) are known to be orbitally unstable in 1(R ) by a general property by Grillakis, Shatah and Strauss [13].

We further develop soliton analysis by exploring solutions which behave as a soliton or a sum of

solitons as time goes to infinity.

For all  R such that | | < 1 and 0  R , let us denote

, 0 ( , ) :=

, 0( , ) =

, 0( , ) - ·  , 0( , )

When 0 = 0, we will write instead of ,0 for the sake of simplification.

Drawing on the work by Grillakis, Shatah and Strauss [13, 14], Côte and Muñoz [8] have developed and proved spectral results adapted to the unstable dynamic around the (vector) soliton . Essential

properties which are needed in this paper, as well as the introduction of useful notations, are presented in the next subsection. Note that a similar spectral theory was firstly considered by Pego and Weinstein [25] in the context of the generalized Korteweg-de Vries equations.
Starting from this point of view, we are interested in solutions which converge to a soliton or a sum of solitons for large values of ; these solutions are classically known as multi-solitons.

Let us consider an integer  1 and 2 parameters

1, . . . ,  R and 1, . . . ,  R

such that

 = 1, . . . , , | | < 1 and   ,  .

We recall the following theorem by Côte and Muñoz which states the existence of at least one multi-soliton.

Theorem 1.1 ([8]). There exist 0, 0  R and 0 > 0, only depending on the sets ( ) , ( ) , and

a solution =

 C ( [ 0, +), 1(R ) × 2(R )) of (NLKG) such that for all  0,

( )-

, ()

We notice that this theorem has been extended to solutions describing multi-bound states by Côte

and Martel [6], that is to multi-traveling waves made of any number of decoupled general (excited)

bound states. In the present paper, we will however only focus on multi-solitary waves in the above

sense.

Since solitons are unstable, a solution of (NLKG) which behaves as a soliton in large time is not

expected to be necessarily a soliton. One of our goals is thus to precise the dynamic of the flow of

(NLKG) near a soliton. Similarly, the dynamic near a sum of solitons is also supposed to be more

complex as time goes to infinity.

1.2. Main results. Given distinct velocity parameters, we aim at proving the existence of a whole family of multi-solitons which turns out to be the unique family of multi-solitons in a certain class of solutions. Our first result reads as follows.
Theorem 1.2. Assume that is of class C 2 and 0 < | | < · · · < | 1| < 1. There exist > 0, 0 < 1 < · · · < , +,  C (R, 1 (R ) × 2 (R ))   (R, 1(R ) × 2 (R )) for = 1, . . . , and a -parameter family ( 1,..., )( 1,..., ) R of solutions of (NLKG) such that, for all ( 1, . . . , )  R , there exist 0  R and > 0 such that

Remark 1.3. The parameters and the functions +, ( = 1, . . . , ) are defined in Proposition 2.1 and in subsection 2.2.
One can moreover precise the value of in Theorem 1.2; for this, we refer to (2.1).

Our next result is concerned with the classification of multi-solitons. We aim at proving that any multi-soliton should belong to the family constructed in Theorem 1.2 above. This is indeed the case, if one knows that the multi-soliton converges sufficiently fast to its profile. As it is stated below, a decay in a power of of degree larger than 3 is a sufficient rate.
Let us emphasize that this is a much weaker assumption than exponential decay, which is natural in view of the convergence (1.2). We also underline that we obtain for (NLKG) an effective rate. As

4

a comparison, in the context of the nonlinear Schrödinger equations, uniqueness of a multi-soliton (in the stable case) was shown in a class of solutions with convergence faster than any power of 1 , see [5]: this is still much weaker than the exponential convergence, but not well behaved as what is proven here for (NLKG). We nevertheless conjecture that the classification should hold in the most general case when no decay rate is assumed.
Here is the precise statement.

Theorem 1.4. Under the assumptions of Theorem 1.2 and keeping the same notations, if is a solution of (NLKG) such that

as  +,

where =

and where > 3, then there exist 1, . . . ,  R and 0  R such that for all

 0, ( ) =  1,..., ( ).

Remark 1.5. Notice that Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.4 apply in dimension  5 only. Indeed,

assuming (H'1) and

of class C 2 forces to have

> 2, hence 2 <

+2 -2

if

 3.

In the case where only one soliton is considered, one can moreover improve the preceding Theorem by completely characterizing solutions which converge to a soliton in large time.

Theorem 1.6. Let  R , | | < 1 and assume that is of class C 2.

There exist > 0, +,  C (R, 1(R )× 2(R )), and a one-parameter family ( ) R of solutions of (NLKG) such that for all  R, there exists 0 = 0 ( )  R such that for all  0

(1.4)

( ) - ( ) - - +, ( ) 1× 2  -2 ,

where :=

Moreover, if is a solution of (NLKG) such that

(1.5)

( ) - ( ) 1× 2  0 as  +,

where =

, then there exist  R and 0  R such that for all  0, ( ) = ( ).

Remark 1.7. The parameter (which depends on ) and the function +, are defined in Proposition 2.1; they are intimately related to the spectral theory dealing with the flow around .

It is interesting to remark that there are only three special solutions among the elements of the preceding family ( ) R, up to translations in time and in space. This is the object of the following

Corollary 1.8. Consider the family of solutions

R defined in Theorem 1.6.

(1) If > 0, there exists  R such that for all possible , ( ) = 1( + , · + ).

(2) If < 0, there exists  R such that for all possible , ( ) = -1( + , · + ).

(3) For all  R, 0( ) = ( ).

Remark 1.9. Let us observe that Remark 1.5 is valid for Theorem 1.6 and Corollary 1.8 too.
Theorem 1.6 provides the behavior of the solutions converging to solitons at the order O -2 in 1 (R ) × 2(R ). The instability direction due to the existence of one negative eigenvalue (related to ) for the linearized operator around yields infinitely many possibilities (described by the real line) to perturb the soliton and to retrieve another solution of (NLKG) which however remains exponentially close in time (with decay rate ) to . Let us emphasize that this phenomenon appears quite naturally in the study of unstable solitons. In a stable mode such as for the 2-subcritical generalized Korteweg-de Vries (gKdV) equation, a solution which converges to a soliton as time goes to infinity is pretty well-known to be exactly the corresponding soliton.

ASYMPTOTIC -SOLITON-LIKE SOLUTIONS OF THE NLKG EQUATION

What is more, Theorem 1.6 is built exactly as in [2]. It reminds us of similar classification results, previously obtained for the 2-supercritical gKdV equations by Combet [2, Theorem 1.1] and for the three-dimensional cubic Schrödinger equation by Duyckaerts and Roudenko [11, Proposition 3.1], both inspired from pioneering works of Duyckaerts and Merle [9, 10].
As far as the multi-soliton case is concerned, Theorem 1.2 provides an -parameter family of solutions to (NLKG) which behave as a sum of (differently boosted) solitons in large time. Here again, the existence result looks like that of Combet [3, 4] and reinforces the idea that, in general, non-uniqueness holds for multi-solitons in an unstable context. Furthermore, Theorem 1.4 opens the way to treat the question of the classification of multi-solitons for other models, at least in the restraint class of solutions with algebraic convergence in the sense of (1.3).

Regarding the global approach developed in this article, we shed new light on the construction of the one-parameter family ( ) R by a compactness procedure. Note that the special solution -1 in [2] has also been obtained in a first rigorous way by a compactness method (the starting point was the proof of instability of the soliton), but the question of obtaining 1 (as well as the other solutions
for > 0) by such method was raised (see Remark 4.15 in [2]) and, to our knowledge, remained unanswered. Obviously, our process can be thought and used as an alternative to prove similar results in the context of other partial differential equations which involve unstable solitons, and for which the spectral theory around the ground states is well understood (and actually analogous to the present case). This is a nice feature of our paper.
A second interesting point to be discussed is about proving uniqueness of multi-solitary waves. Exploring the possibility of obtaining a "weak" monotonicity property like (4.18) in Corollary 4.8 would be a promising direction of research in order to classify multi-solitons of other models.
Besides, a significant issue would be to know to what extent the classification obtained in Theorem 1.6 could be transcribed to the multi-soliton topic. Indeed, contrary to the gKdV setting [2] and especially as for the NLS case [4, 5], proving general uniqueness in the sense of (1.5), where is replaced by a sum of several solitons , , still remains unclear.
Another question to be addressed could be related to the potential generalizations of the previous theorems to multi-bound states.

1.3. Outline and organization of the article. In the spirit of [18] (dealing with the construction

of multi-soliton solutions), our approach to constructing the families in Theorem 1.2 and Theorem

1.6 is based on backward uniform 1 × 2-estimates satisfied by well-chosen sequences of solutions

of (NLKG) which aim to approximate the desired solutions. We entirely exploit a coercivity property

available in the present matter (see Proposition 2.2 stated below) in order to establish those estimates

and, in fact, to obtain the expected exponential convergences to zero in time. We finally use continuity

of the flow of (NLKG) for the weak 1 × 2-topology to obtain special solutions which fulfill (1.2)

or (1.4).

Based on compactness and energy methods, the proof of Theorem 1.2 follows more precisely the

strategy of [3, which roughly

4]. The asserts

construction of  1,..., that each multi-soliton

is done by iteration, by means of Proposition 3.1 can be perturbed slightly at the order - around

the soliton , . In order to establish this key proposition, we particularly rely on the topological

ingredient set up originally by Côte, Martel and Merle [7] for the construction of one given multi-

soliton in unstable situations.

For the construction of in the one-soliton case (Theorem 1.6), we also substantially rely on the

spectral theory available for (NLKG), built on the linearized operator of the flow around the boosted

ground state. In particular, we point out that our approach differs from previous articles [9, 10, 11, 2]

where the construction centers around the contraction principle.

Regarding the question of classification, from (1.4) and orthogonality properties exposed in the

next section, we notice that corresponds to the limit of

, -, as  + in Theorem 1.6.

This is precisely useful for the uniqueness part of this theorem, where the goal is to identify with

6

XAVIER FRIEDERICH

an element of the one-parameter family ( ) R. Actually, to prove the second part of Theorem 1.6, we follow [2] in the first instance (up to the obtainment of an exponential control of - ). Then, a refined version of the coercivity argument considered in [2], and indeed an elementary but careful analysis of the available estimates, allows us to reach the conclusion, that is to show that equals some (already constructed in the first part of the theorem), and that without making use of any supplementary tool. We underline once again that we do not need any fixed point argument to conclude.
Yet, we do not exclude the possibility to prove Theorem 1.6 via the contraction principle; if the nonlinearity is sufficiently regular (C +1 for instance), one could precise by this means the behavior of in large time, and indeed expand the solution at the order O -( +1) in the Sobolev space
, in line with [9]. For clarity purposes, we will not explore this path further and anyway, our description of the family ( ) R is sufficient to characterize solutions verifying (1.5).
Concerning Theorem 1.4, the identification of the solution satisfying (1.3) is done step by step as in [3]. The core of the proof is the obtainment of an almost monotonicity property, inspired by Martel and Merle [19]. By means of a technical lemma of analysis (we refer to Lemma 7.1 in Appendix), this monotonicity property allows us to see that any multi-soliton in the class with polynomial convergence to zero converges in fact exponentially (see subsection 4.1.4), provided one assumes suitable integrability conditions in the neighborhood of + (and indeed > 3). Such a "weak" monotonicity property has a priori been used so far only for the construction of multi-solitons or multi-bound states of the energy-critical wave equation [19, 28, 29]. We also underline that, by Lemma 7.1, we directly obtain the adequate exponential convergence rate which allows us to identify 1; this is in contrast with [3]. The monotonicity property is also used as a key ingredient to identify the other parameters
2, . . . , .

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce essential notations and tools which are used throughout our article. In the following sections, we establish the proofs of our main results; for ease of writing, each proof will be made in dimension 1. Section 3 is devoted to the construction of the family of multi-solitons described in Theorem 1.2. Section 4 deals with the classification of multi-solitons, which is the object of Theorem 1.4. In Section 5, we study the existence part of Theorem 1.6 focusing on one soliton. Section 6 aims at proving the second part of this latter theorem, that is general uniqueness of the one-parameter family previously constructed. In the appendix, we explain how to adapt the proof to all dimensions, we justify Corollary 1.8, and we state and prove the lemma of analytic theory of differential equations used in Section 4.
As usual, denotes a positive constant which may depend on the soliton parameters and change from one line to the other, but which is always independent of and .

3.1. Compactness argument assuming uniform estimate. The goal of this subsection is to explain how to prove Proposition 3.1; for this, we follow the strategy of Combet [3] and Côte and Muñoz [8], both inspired from pioneering work by Martel [18] and Côte, Martel and Merle [7]. One key ingredient in the construction is the obtainment of uniform estimates satisfied by a sequence of approximating solutions of (NLKG).
We fix  {1, . . . , } and  R. Let ( ) be an increasing sequence of time such that  +. Let us consider = ( , ) <   R - the generic term of a sequence of parameters to be determined, and let be the maximal solution of (NLKG) such that

(3.3)

( ) = ( ) + -

+, ( ) +

, +, ( ),

where :=

.

Concerning , we claim:

Proposition 3.2. There exist 0  0 and 0 > 0 (independent of ) such that for each  0, there exists  R - with | |  2 -( +2 ) and such that is defined on [ 0, ] and satisfies

(3.4)

  [ 0, ],

( ) - ( ) - - +, ( ) 1× 2  -( + ) .

The take the role of modulation parameters and are to be determined (if indeed possible) so that fulfills (3.4), thus is a natural candidate in order to "approximate" the desired solution which is the object of Proposition 3.2.

We postpone the proof of the previous statement at the next subsection; for the time being, let us assume that Proposition 3.2 is satisfied and let us show how it implies Proposition 3.1. In fact, the existence of is due to the continuity of the flow of (NLKG) for the weak 1 × 2 topology. We explicit the construction of below, following the same strategy as [7, paragraph 2.2, step 2] or [8, section 4].

Proof of Proposition 3.1. We observe that the sequence ( ( 0) 1× 2) N is bounded; thus there exist a subsequence of ( ( 0)) N, say ( ( 0)) N, and 0  1(R)× 2 (R) such that ( ( 0)) N converges to 0 in the sense of the weak topology in 1(R) × 2(R). Let us consider , defined as the maximal solution of (NLKG) such that ( 0) = 0. Let  0. For sufficiently large,  and thus is defined on [ 0, ]. By a standard result (we refer to [8, Lemma 10] and [27, Theorem 1.2]), is defined on [ 0, ] and ( ( )) converges weakly to ( ) in 1(R) × 2(R).

3.2. Proof of Proposition 3.2. For ease of reading, we will drop the index subsection (except for ), that is, we will write for , for , etc.
Let us introduce the following variable (which depends on )

( ) := ( ) - ( ) - - +, ( )

and for all  {1, . . . , },

±, ( ) := ( ), ±, ( )

(which depends on in particular by definition of = (3.3)). We denote also -( ) := ( -, ( )) <  .

3.2.1. Modulated final data and strategy of the proof of Proposition 3.2. We make the first step in order to determine the appropriate modulation parameter . We obtain as the solution of a well-chosen equation; this is the object of the following

Lemma 3.3. There exists 0  0 such that for all  0 and for all  R - , there exists a unique  R - such that  2 and -( ) = .

Proof. Let us consider the linear application

:

Its matrix in the canonical basis of R - has generic entry , := +, + ( ), -, + ( ) where

Since

- 0

for  , with 0 > 0 independent of , we have

 = + with

for

large values of

. Thus  is invertible (for

large) and -1

 2.

We deduce the content of Lemma 3.3 by taking 0 large enough and by considering, for a given

 R - , the element := -1( ).

Roughly speaking, Lemma 3.3 reflects that estimate (3.4) is to be proven by choosing a relevant
vector = -( ). The reason why we determine according to the value of -( ) essentially comes from the directions -, , which yield "instability" in some sense (given Claim 3.7 below), and also from definition (3.5) below.

At this stage, we notice that we already have:

Claim 3.4. We have:

(1)   {1, . . . , }, | +, ( )|  | | -2 . (2)   {1, . . . , }, | -, ( )|  | | -2 . (3) ( ) 1× 2  | |.

Let 0 > 0 independent of to be chosen later and  R - ( -( +2 ) ) to be determined. We consider the associated data given by Lemma 3.3 and defined in (3.3).

Let us define

(3.5) ( ) := inf{  0 |   [ , ],

( ) 1× 2  -( + ) and ( +2 ) - ( )  R - (1)}.

We observe that Proposition 3.2 holds if for all , we can find such that ( ) = 0. In the rest of the proof, our goal is thus to prove the existence of such an element .

To this end, we will first of all improve the estimate on ( ) 1× 2 which falls within the definition of ( ). This is the object of the following subsection. Then, we will only need to care about
the second condition, which implies a control of -( ); this is done in subsection 3.2.3.

3.2.2. Improvement of the estimate on

1× 2 . For notation purposes and ease of reading,

we sometimes omit the index and also write O ( ( )) in order to refer to a function which a

priori depends on and such that there exists  0 such that for all large and for all  [  , ],

| ( )|  | ( )|.

Step 1: Estimates on ±, . Let us begin with the computation of the time derivative of .

and the Sobolev embedding 1(R)   (R).

Now, we are in a position to prove the following estimate on ±, . Claim 3.7. For all  {1, . . . , } and for all  [ ( ), ], we have

Step 2: Control of the stable directions.

Claim 3.8. We have for all  {1, . . . , }, for all  [ ( ), ],

(3.9)

| +, ( ) |  -( +4 ) .

Proof. Due to Claim 3.7 and (3.5), we obtain

+, ( ) - +, ( )  -( +4 ) ,

that is, for all  [ ( ), ],

- +, ( )   -( + +4 ) .

Integrating, we deduce that for all  [ ( ), ],

|-

+, ( ) - - +, ( )| 

-( + +4 ) .

Thus,

| +, ( ) |  | +, ( ) | + -( +4 ) .

From Claim 3.4 and Lemma 3.3, we have

| +, ( )|  -2 | |

-( +2 )

 -( +4 ) .

Consequently, Claim 3.8 indeed holds.

Step 3: Control of the unstable directions for  .

Claim 3.9. We have for all  {1, . . . , }, for all  [ ( ), ],

(3.10)

| -, ( ) |  -( +4 ) .

Proof. As in the preceding step, we have for all  {1, . . . , } and  [ ( ), ],

(3.11)

-, ( ) + -, ( )  -( +4 ) ,

which writes also For  , we have

-, ( )   ( - +4 ) .  , and so by integration, we obtain

| -, ( ) |  ( - ) | -, ( ) | + -( +4 ) .

But again from Claim 3.4 and Lemma 3.3, we infer

( - ) | -, ( )|  

( - ) -2

-( +2 )

( - ) ( - ) - -4

 -( +4 ) .

Thus

  {1, . . . , },   [ ( ), ], | -, ( )|  -( +4 ) .

Step 4: Control of a Lyapunov functional satisfying a coercivity property. Let us consider

:RR  2 Arctan ( - ) .

We define for all = 1, . . . , - 1, 1
( , ) := 

- ( ) + ( +1) - ( ) + ( +1) ,

2

2

and then

1( ) = 1( ) ( ) = ( ) - -1 ( ) for all = 2, . . . , - 1, ( ) = 1 - -1 ( ).

Recall that the permutation has been chosen so that -1 < (1) < · · · < ( ) < 1.

Now, let us introduce for all  {1, . . . , }

hence the expected claim, by summing on .

Step 5: Control of the directions . To obtain a control of the scalar products ,

which is more precise than the a priori control by variable ~ :

where ( )  R, = 1, . . . , are chosen so that for all = 1, . . . , , ~ ( ), ( ) = 0.

Existence and uniqueness of the family ( ( )) {1,..., } are justified by the fact that the (interaction)

( ), ( ) is invertible for large enough.

Notice that

Now, gathering (3.15), Claim 3.11, and Claim 3.12, we immediately deduce the expected estimate

of

3.2.3. Control of the unstable directions for > and end of the proof. To control - =
-, <  and eventually obtain the following statement, we resort to a classical topological argument, already set up in [3] and initially developed by Côte, Martel and Merle [7].

Lemma 3.13. For 0 large enough, there exists  R - ( -( +2 ) ) such that ( ) = 0.

The proof follows that of Combet [3]. We write it below for the sake of completeness.

Proof.

We first choose

0 sufficiently large such that

Then, we have by Lemma 3.5

-(

+ ) ( ) , by definition of

( ) and continuity of the flow, we have:

| -( ( ))| = 1.

(We recall that - ( ) = ( -, ( )) <  .) In other words, the map

M:

R - ( -( +2 ) ) - -

R - ( -( +2 ) ) -( +2 ) ( - ( )) - ( ( ))

is well-defined. Now, we aim at showing that M is continuous and that its restriction to R - ( -( +2 ) ) is the identity.

Let  [ 0, ( )] be such that is defined on [ , ] and, by continuity,

  [ , ],

( ) 1× 2  1.

We consider, for all  [ , ]:

N ( ) := N ( - ( )) =

( +2 )

2
-( ) .

Claim 3.14. For 0 large enough, and for all  [ , ] such that N ( ) = 1, we have: N  ( )  -( +1 - - 2 ).
Proof of Claim 3.14. Let us start from estimate (3.11): for all  { + 1, . . . , }, for all  [ , ],

-, +

-,  -( +4 ) .

Thus we obtain for all  { + 1, . . . , },

Then, summing on  { + 1, . . . , } leads to

|

-( )|2


+2

+1| - ( ) |2 

-( +4 ) | - ( ) |.

Therefore we can estimate: N ( ) = 2( +2 ) 2( + 2 )| - ( )|2 + | - ( )|2 

 2( +2 ) 2( + 2 ) | - ( ) |2 - 2 +1| - ( ) |2 + -( +4 ) | - ( ) | .

Hence we have for all  | , ],

N( )  - N( ) +

| -( )|,

where = 2( +1 - - 2 ) > 0 by definition of . In particular, for all  [ , ] satisfying N ( ) = 1, we have:

N( )  - +

| -( )|  - +

-( +2 )  - + -2 0 .

Now, we fix 0 large enough such that have

-2 0  2 . Thus for all  [ , ] such that N ( ) = 1, we N( )  - . 2

Finally, we claim that  ( ) is continuous. Indeed, let > 0. By definition of ( ) and by Claim 3.14, there exists > 0 such that for all  [ ( ) + , ], N ( ) < 1 - , and such that N ( ( ) - ) > 1 + . But from continuity of the flow, there exists > 0 such that for all ~ satisfying
~ -  , we have
  [ ( ) - , ], |N (~) - N ( )|  . 2
We finally deduce that ( ) -  (~)  ( ) + .
Hence,  ( ) is continuous.
We then obtain that the map M is continuous. What is more, for  R - ( -( +2 ) ), as N ( )  -( +1 - - 2 ) < 0, we then deduce by definition of ( ) that ( ) = , and thus, M( ) = . The existence of such a map M contradicts Brouwer's fixed point theorem. Thus, we have finished proving Lemma 3.13.

Proof. We do not detail the proof of this lemma which is similar to Claim 3.12. It suffices to start by

differentiating the orthogonality relation , ( ) = 0 with respect to and then to control terms

For all  0, ( ) is a piecewise C 1 function. Set ( ) := =1 ( ¯ , +1 ). It follows from the definition of that

Gathering Propositions 4.9 and 4.10, we deduce

Proposition 4.11. There exists  0 such that for sufficiently large,

( ) 1× 2  - 1 .

4.2. Identification of the solution. Recall that we have constructed in Section 3 a family of

multi-solitons ( 1,..., ) such that for all = 1, . . . , , for all  0,

(4.30)

 1,..., ( ) -  1 ,..., -1 ( ) -

- +, ( ) 1× 2  -( + ) .

(We can always assume that < min 1, min =2,..., { - -1} ). Following the strategy of Combet [3], our goal is to establish

Proposition 4.12. For all defining
we have:

= 1, . . . ,

, there exist  0, 0  0, and := -  1,..., ,

1, . . . ,

 R such that,

(4.31)

( ) 1× 2  - .

Moreover, denoting ±, , := , ±, for all = 1, . . . , , we have

(4.32)

  {1, . . . , },

-, , ( )  0, as  +.

Proof. We proceed by induction on . First, we focus on the case where = 1. We have ( ) 1× 2  - 1 by Proposition 4.11. Thus, by Lemma 4.2 and given that
( 1 -,1)  - .
Since  - is integrable in +, there exists 1  R such that

< 1,

1 -,1 ( )  1, as  +.

We then define 1 := -  1 . We notice that 1 = + ( -  1 ) so that

1( ) 1× 2   

( ) 1× 2 + ( ) -  1 ( ) 1× 2 - 1 +  1 ( ) - ( ) - 1 - 1 +,1 ( ) -1.

the last line resulting from the definition of 1. Thus Proposition 4.12 is true for = 1.

We now assume that there exist 1, . . . , -1  R such that

all = 1, . . . , - 1,

-, -1, ( )  0 as  +.

Let us show

-1 ( ) 1× 2  - -1 and for

Claim 4.13. We have

-1 ( ) 1× 2  - .

· To prove this claim, we show that, if -1 ( )  - 0 with

-1 ( ) 1× 2  -( + 0) .

-1 < 0 <

(by the same calculations and arguments as those developed in the proof of Lemma 4.2), we have for all = 1, . . . , - 1,

(

-, -1, )  -( + 0- ) .

Since  -( + 0- ) is integrable in the neighborhood of + (since  -1), and by

assumption,

-, -1, ( )  0 as  +, we have by integration

| -, -1, ( ) |  -( + 0) .

For all = , . . . , we obtain

, we have + 0 -  + 0 - -, -1, ( ) - 0 -, -1, ( 0) 

< 0, thus by integration on [ 0, ], ( - 0- ) .

Eventually, we obtain (by a "cut-and-paste" of the argument exposed in subsection 4.1)

-1 ( ) 1× 2  sup | -, -1, ( ) | 
  =1

-( 0+ ) ,

which is what was expected. · Now, from the preceding induction, there exists ~ 0  - , such that

-1 ( ) 1× 2  - ~ 0 ,

from which we deduce

(

-, -1, )  -( + ~ 0- ) .

Now, for  {1, . . . , - 1}, - - ~ 0  -1 - - < 0, we thus have

| -, -1, ( ) |  -( 0+ ~ )  - .

For = , we have |( -, -1, )|  ( - ~ 0- ) . Thus, there exists  R such that

-, -1, ( )  , as  +.

For  { + 1, . . . , }, we have + ~ 0 - < + - < 0, thus by integration

| -, -1, ( )|

-( ~0+ )

Hence,

-1 ( ) 1× 2  sup | -, -1, ( ) |

immediately have

This contradicts the definition of  as an infimum. Hence  = 0 and (5.3) (and thus (5.4)) holds on [ 0, ] for all . This achieves the proof of Proposition 5.1.

The existence of (and ), as stated in Theorem 1.6 is a consequence of Proposition 5.1 and the continuity of the flow of (NLKG) for the weak 1 × 2 topology. We will not detail the construction of considering that it is a sort of cut and paste of what was done in order to prove Proposition 3.1
in the context of multiple solitons.

Similarly, we do not repeat the arguments exposed at the beginning of section 3 which justify that the map  is one-to-one. We devote the next subsection to the proof of Proposition 5.2.
5.2. Proof of Proposition 5.2. We assume that ( ) is defined on some interval [  , ] and satisfies (5.3). We want to show that (5.4) holds, provided that the parameters 0 and 0 are well chosen.

In this subsection again, for notation purposes and ease of reading, we sometimes omit the index
and also write O ( ( )) in order to refer to a function which a priori depends on and such that there exists  0 (independent of ) such that for all large and for all  [  , ], | ( )|  | ( )|.

5.2.1. Step 1: Set up of a modulation argument.

Lemma 5.3. For 0  0 sufficiently large and 0 > 0 sufficiently small, there exists a unique C 1 function : [  , ]  R such that if we set

( ) := ( ) - ~ ( ) - - ~+, ( ),

with ~ ( ) := ( , · - ( )) and ~+, ( ) := +, ( , · - ( )), then for all  [  , ],

(5.5)

( ), ~ ( ) = 0.

Moreover there exists 1 > 0 such that for all  [  , ],

(5.6)

( ) 1× 2 + | ( )|  1 0,

(5.7)

| ( )|  1

( ) 1× 2 + -2

.

Remark 5.4. Notice that by uniqueness of the function and by definition of (see (5.1)), we have ( ) = 0 and ( ) = 0.

Proof. The existence of such that (5.5) is granted and the existence of 2 > 0 such that
( ) 1× 2 + | ( )|  2 0 are standard consequences of the implicit function theorem. Now, let us prove (5.7). For this, we notice that = satisfies the following equation:

(5.8)

Observing moreover that

We obtain: 2 - + ( ~ )

the last arguments remain unchanged. However note that, in this case, the obtained estimates are at the cost of a worse exponential term.

0 and 0, there

At this stage, we can deduce that for all in [  , ], ( )  0. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exists ~  [  , ] such that ( ~ ) > 0. Then, we can define
:= sup{  [~ , ], ( ) > 0}.

We necessarily have ( ) = 0. Indeed, ( ) < 0 is excluded by continuity of  in (on the left side) and by definition of the supremum; if ( ) > 0, then < (since ( ) = - ~ - ) which leads
once more to a contradiction, using the continuity of  in (on the right side) and the definition of as a supremum. It follows that ( )  0; thus  is non-decreasing in the neighborhood of and
in particular, ( )  0 on [ - , ] for some > 0. This again contradicts the definition of . Hence, for all in [  , ], ( )  0. Given that - +, satisfies the same differential system as +, , we finally obtain (5.26).

Lemma 6.8. There exists   R such that for sufficiently large,

Proof. Define ( ) := ( ) - ( ) - - +, ( ) and decompose ( , ) as follows:

(6.14)

( , ) = ( , ) + ~ ( , ) - ( , - ) - - +, ( , - ) - ( , - ).

Now, we have

(6.15)

~ ( , ) - ( , - ) = ( ( ) - )

Hence, Lemma 6.9 is obtained as a consequence of Proposition 6.6, Lemma 6.8, and the estimate of ( ) 1× 2 given by (1.4), that is ( ) 1× 2 = O -2 .

Thus we deduce that ( ) 1× 2 = 0 for large values of .

Finally let us observe below that  = 0 so that = .

Proposition 6.14. There exists 0  0 such that for all  0, ( ) = ( ).
Proof. On the one hand, we have ( , · - ) - ( , · - ) 1× 2  - . On the other, we have ( ) - ( ) 1× 2  0 as  +. Since we have ( ) = ( , · - ), it follows from the triangular inequality that

( ) - ( , · - ) 1× 2  0 as  +. Hence  = 0 by the following claim, which is a consequence of Taylor formula.

Claim 6.15. There exist 0 > 0, 0 > 0, and > 0 such that (1) if ||  0, then 2  (· + ) - 2 1  4 2; (2) if || > 0, then (· + ) - 2 1 > 0.

7. A
7.1. Extension of the proofs to higher dimensions. The main parts of the proofs remain obviously unchanged. Essentially three notable adaptations are to be made, passing from the onedimensional case to higher dimensions.

In a first instance, one has to be careful about how establishing several estimates. Although all
estimates we have proved in the previous sections (in dimension 1) are identical for general , the
way we establish them when  2 can be altered. For example, we point out that it is no longer possible to use the Sobolev embedding 1   when
 2. Particularly, multi-solitons in dimension  2 do not necessarily take values in  (R ) and
in order to estimate a quantity like

( ) - ( ) - ( )( - )

(as for proving Claim 3.6), we would proceed as follows: by (H'1), we deduce that | ( )| = ( - 1)| | -2, thus applying Taylor formula, we have for fixed time  R and position  R ,

| ( ) - ( ) - ( )( - )| ( , )  | - |2( , )

sup

| ( )|

2

[ ( , ), ( , )]

 | - |2 ( , ) | | -2 ( , ) + | | -2( , ) .

Now, for all   (R ) and for all  1(R ), Hölder inequality yields

 | || ( ) - ( )|2| | -2 
R

Finally, replacing by ( ) and ( ) - ( ), we obtain an estimate of  ( ( ) - ( ) - ( )( - ))

in terms of -

1,

1, and

1 due to the Sobolev embedding 1(R )  (R ).

Secondly, in view of Proposition 2.1, one has to take into account, for all = 1, . . . , the directions which generate the kernel of the operator H when we practice modulation in dimension
. For instance, in Lemma 4.1, we would define as follows:

:= -

· -

+, ,

=1

=1

with ( )  R and ( )  R such that for all = 1, . . . , and for all = 1, . . . , :

(7.1)

( ), ( ) = 0

(7.2)

( ), -, ( ) = 0.

But each time this extension does not affect the sequel; in other words, the estimates we are supposed to obtain afterwards and their proofs are the same.

A third change to be done concerns the way we define the different Lyapunov functionals which are studied throughout the article. To deal with dimensions greater or equal than 2, we reduce the problem to the case of a one-dimensional variable. For instance, let us explain how to generalize Step 4 in subsection 3.2.2 to all dimensions. The subset

M :=   R |  · ( - ) = 0


of R is of zero Lebesgue measure. Hence, there exists   R such that for all  ,

 · ( - )  0.

In

particular

and, even if

we

can

assume

that

so

that 

=

1, . . . , , | · | < 1. Now, defining ~ :=  · , and even if it means changing the permutation ,

we have

-1 < ~ (1) < ~ (2) < · · · < ~ ( ) < 1.

Then, the direction described by  is to be favored: we consider the following cut-off functions:

()=

1 

·

- ~ ( ) + ~ ( +1) -  ·

( )+

( +1)

.

At this stage, the definition of the functions in terms of the is kept unchanged and the corre-

7.2. Proof of Corollary 1.8. The proof is an immediate adaptation of that of Proposition 4.12 in [2].

Let > 0 and denote := - ln( ) . In the sense of the 1 × 2-norm, we have:

1 ( + , · + ) = ( + , · + ) + - ( + ) +, ( + , · + ) + O -2

= ( ) + - +, ( ) + O -2 .

Then, 1 ( + , · + that for all  0,

But on the other hand,

~ ( ) = ( ) + ~ - +, ( ) + O -2 .

Hence, which implies

( - ~) - +, ( ) = O -2 , = ~. Consequently, ( ) = 1 ( + , · + ).

If < 0, we have just to repeat the above argument with - instead of .

Lastly, let us identify 0. Given that is a solution of (NLKG) which satisfies (1.5), Theorem 1.2 provides the existence of  R and of 0  R such that for all  0, ( ) = ( ). Since satisfies (1.4), we deduce that
- +, ( ) 1× 2  -2 . Thus = 0 and 0 = is defined for all  R.

7.3. A result of analytic theory of differential equations.

Lemma 7.1. Let 0  R, A : [ 0, +)  R be a C 1 bounded function, and continuous and integrable.

If, for some > 0,

  0,

|A ( ) + A( )|  ( ) sup |A( )|,


then there exists > 0 such that

  0, |A( )|  - .

: [ 0, +)  R+ be

Proof. Let us assume that

(7.3)

  0,

|A ( ) + A( )|  ( ) sup |A( )|,


for some > 0. Then for all  0,

|( A)( )|  ( ) sup |A( )|.


Let us consider  0. For   , we obtain by integration



| A( ) - A( )| 

( ) sup |A( )| .



This implies that, for   , |A( )| 



|A( )| + sup |A( )| 

() .



From the preceding line, we deduce that for all   ,

 +

(7.4)

|A( )|  |A( )| + sup |A( )|

() .



Now 0 as

we consider 1  0 such  +). By passing to

that  + ( ) 1
the supremum

< on 

1 2

(which

in (7.4),

is indeed possible we obtain for all

given  1,

that



+

()



sup |A( )|  2|A( )|.


Consequently, assumption (7.3) becomes

(7.5)

  1, |A( ) + A( )|  2 ( )|A( )|.

ASYMPTOTIC -SOLITON-LIKE SOLUTIONS OF THE NLKG EQUATION

51

Let us define ( ) := |A( )|. By integration of (7.5), we obtain 

(7.6)

  1,

( )  ( 1) + 2 ( ) ( ) .

By a standard Grönwall argument, we conclude to the existence of > 0 such that for all

argument.

(7.7)

2 ( ) ( ) = exp 2 ( )

This achieves the proof of Lemma 7.1.
