We prove a no Cauchy horizon theorem for general nonlinear electrodynamics black holes with charged scalar hairs. By constructing a radially conserved charged, we show that there is no inner Cauchy horizon for both spherical and planar symmetric cases, independent of the form of scalar potential and nonlinear electrodynamics. After imposing the null energy condition, we are also able to rule out the existence of the Cauchy horizon for the hyperbolic black holes. We take the BornInfeld black hole as a concrete example to study the interior dynamics beyond the event horizon. When the contribution from the scalar potential can be neglected, the asymptotic near-singularity takes a universal Kasner form. We also confirm that the intricate interior dynamics is closely associated with the instability of the inner Cauchy horizon triggered by scalar hairs.

I. INTRODUCTION
Black holes have been the object of much interest in both theory and observation. The defining feature of a black hole is the appearance of an event horizon which is the boundary of no escape and divides the spacetime into internal and external regions. While it was well established that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity [1, 2], the convinced observational evidence of black holes has been reported in recent years, including the detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes [3] and the first image of a black hole in the galaxy M87 [4, 5].
To understand the interior of a black hole is a fundamental topic in general relativity, which is important for the studies of black hole physics, gravitation and quantum physics. As described by general relativity, in the interior of a black hole there typically lies a gravitational singularity where the spacetime curvature becomes infinite. All laws of physics could break down at a singularity and the study of the black hole interior is challenging. Apart from the singularity, there are many black hole solutions which have an inner Cauchy horizon behind the event horizon, e.g. Reisser-Nordstr¨om (RN) black hole and Kerr black hole. The appearance of Cauchy horizon ruins the predictability of the classical dynamics. The

so-called strong cosmic censorship conjecture asks for the instability and ensuing disappearance of Cauchy horizons (see, e.g. [6, 7]). Interestingly, recent development suggests that Cauchy horizons for some kind of charged black holes are nonlinear unstable in the presence of scalar hairs [8­12]. In particular, independent of the form of scalar potentials and the asymptotic boundary of spacetimes, a no Cauchy horizon theorem for black holes with charged scalar hairs was proved in [10]. The discussion has been soon extended to black holes in Horndeski theory [11] and Gauss-Bonnet theory [12]. Those studies focus on the charged black holes with the classical Maxwell's electrodynamics. Given its potential importance in understanding the interior structure of black holes, it would be worth classifying other extensions of the theorem.
In the present work we will extend the theorem to charged black holes with respect to nonlinear generalizations of the Maxwell's electrodynamics and will investigate the interior dynamics of the corresponding hairy black holes. Nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) has a long history in physics and there are many motivations for the study of NED. For example, the nonlinear Born-Infeld theory [13] can cure the divergence of self-energy for charged particles and naturally arises in the low energy limit of string theory. The Euler Heinsenberg form [14] appears from a 1-loop QED correction to Maxwell's Lagrangian. Interestingly, singularity-free black holes can be constructed by considering a suitable NED [15], which in the weak field approximation becomes the usual linear Maxwell theory. The NED has also been used to realize the

2

anomalous scalings of strange metals by holographic duality, see e.g. [16­18] and attracted many interests in cosmology, see e.g. [19­22]. There are various theories with nonlinear electromagnetic interactions in the literature and a recent discussion about the black hole thermodynamics in the presence of nonlinear electromagnetic fields can be found in [23]. Note that one can construct a charged black hole with arbitrary number of horizons by considering NED, see e.g. [24, 25].
Nevertheless, we will show that once a charged scalar hair develops, all inner horizons behind the event horizon are removed for black holes with spherical or planar topological symmetry. For the hyperbolic horizon case, we show that hairy black hole can only have at most one inner horizon with additional (but weak) constraint on the form of NED. Furthermore, if we require the energy momentum tensor to satisfy the null energy condition (NEC), we can prove that there is no Cauchy horizon for hairy black holes with all symmetric horizons. We will also study the interior dynamics of Born-Infeld action which is natural from a top-down perspective. Similar to the Maxwell theory [10], the geometry near the singularity takes a Kasner form as long as the contribution of scalar potential to the background is subdominant. In contrast, the gauge potential shows a different scaling behavior from the Maxwell case. Depending on the value of Born-Infeld parameter, the nonlinear dynamics inside the event horizon shows qualitatively different behaviors away from the singularity, depending on whether the normal charged black hole without scalar hair has a Cauchy horizon or not. For the hyperbolic hairy black hole, it is possible to have a fine-tuned Cauchy horizon by violating the NEC. For this case there is a timelike singularity and the asymptotic solution turns out to be a Lifshitz and hyperscaling violating geometry.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the Einstein-NED theory with a charged scalar field and give the equations of motion for isotropic black holes with symmetric horizons, including planar, hyperbolical and spherical topology cases. In Section III, we prove the no Cauchy horizon theorem. We study the black hole interior dynamics in the Born-Infeld case for different Born-Infeld parameters in Section (IV). We conclude in Section V with some discussions. In Appendix A we discuss the constraint on the number of inner horizons for the hyperbolic black holes. In Appendix B and Appendix C, we consider possible behaviors near the singularity for the hairy Born-Infeld black holes.

II. MODEL AND EQUATIONS OF MOTION

We consider a (d + 2) dimensional theory with gravity coupled with an electromagnetic field Aµ and a charged scalar field . The action reads

dd+2x-g[R + LM ] ,

LM = L(s) - (Dµ)(Dµ) - V (||2) ,

limit of NED. V is a general function of ||2 and de-

termines the asymptotic geometry of spacetimes.

The equations of motion derived from the ac-

tion (2.1) are given by

III. INTERIOR STRUCTURE
In this section we will understand the interior structure of the hairy black holes (2.4) for the theory (2.1) with NED. We find two methods to remove the inner Cauchy horizon. The first method is based on the conserved charge [10] and the second one takes advantage of the NEC.

FIG. 1. Schematic structure for the blackening function f (z) of a black hole at finite temperature with an event horizon at zH and an inner Cauchy horizon at zI . f (z) is vanishing at both horizons with f (zH ) < 0 and f (zI ) > 0 in the coordinate system we are considering.

Besides the event horizon at zH , we assume that there is an inner Cauchy horizon at zI behind the event horizon. Then one has f (zH ) = f (zI ) = 0 with zI > zH . We consider a black hole at finite temperatures, for which the blackening function f (z) turns
from positive to negative near zH towards the interior. Near the inner horizon zI , f (z) turns from negative to positive for which f (zI ) > 0 [26]. The schematic structure for this case with two horizons is illustrated
in Fig. 1. Therefore, we have

f (zH ) =0, f (zH ) < 0 , f (zI ) =0, f (zI ) > 0 .

(3.9)

Furthermore, for a black hole with non-trivial charged scalar hairs, the smoothness of geometry near both

horizons yields [10] At(zH ) = 0, At(zI ) = 0 .

3 (3.10)

A. Proof of no Cauchy horizon via conserved charge

Following [10], we first prove the no Cauchy horizon theorem for planar and spherical topological horizons without knowing the details of the interior geometry. Then we consider the hyperbolic case, for which we can constraint the number of inner horizons under particular condition.
Our first task is to extend the radially conserved charge Q of [10] to the NED case. Using the equations of motion, we obtain the following radially conserved quantity

Q(z) =z2-de/2[z-2(f e-) - LsAtAt]
z
+ 2k(d - 1) y-de-(y)/2dy ,

(3.11)

for which Q (z) = 0. Note that the last integrated term depends on the topology of a black hole.
Taking advantage of Q(zH ) = Q(zI ) and using the conditions (3.9) and (3.10), we obtain

with zH and zI representing the location of event horizon and Cauchy horizon, respectively. It is obvious that the left hand side of (3.12) is negative since f (zH ) < 0 and f (zI ) > 0 (see Fig. 1). On the other hand, the integration of the right hand side is positive as its integrand is positive for any z. As a result, we have the following three cases.

1. Spherical topology case k = 1
For the spherical topology, the right hand side of (3.12) is positive, while the left hand side is negative. Therefore, smooth Cauchy horizon is forbidden for spherical black holes with charged scalar hairs in the presence of NED.

2. Planar topology case k = 0
For the planar black hole (k = 0), the right hand side of (3.12) is vanishing, while the left hand side is

4

negative. Again, there is no smooth Cauchy horizon for planar black holes with charged scalar hairs.

3. Hyperbolic topology case k = -1
For the hyperbolic case with k = -1, both sides of (3.12) are negative. Therefore, we are not able to rule out the existence of an inner Cauchy horizon. In contrast to both spherical and planar cases, it is possible to develop an inner horizon as long as (3.12) is satisfied. In fact, a concrete example for the hyperbolic black hole with an inner horizon was provided in [10] for L(s) = s. For the hyperbolic case with the standard Maxwell term, it have been proved that the hairy black holes can only have at most one inner horizon [10]. However, the argument of [10] does not apply to the present case with general NED i.e. L(s). Only for the NED with Ls  0 can one use the method developed by [10] and find that there is at most one inner horizon, see Appendix A for more details.

B. NEC removes Cauchy horizons

Note, however, that in above argument we do not impose any constraint on the form of matter fields. More recently, the authors of [31] found that if the interior of a static black hole with hyperbolic or planar symmetry is dominated by classical matter satisfying NEC, there is at most one non-degenerate inner horizon behind the event horizon. Interestingly, we now show that for the present theory (2.1) we can give a much stronger constraint on the number of inner horizons by imposing the NEC. The NEC says that Tµ kµk  0 for arbitrary null vector kµ. For general L(s), we can prove that there is no inner Cauchy horizon provided the NEC is satisfied.
The proof is given as follows. Since there is an inner horizon at zI , the blackening function f (z) < 0 between zH and zI (Fig. 1). For our present theory with the ansatz (2.4), the NEC implies

IV. DYNAMICS INSIDE BORN-INFELD BLACK HOLE

So far we have completed the proof of the theorem for the interior structure of hairy black holes with NED. We have shown that the inner horizon is in general absent and the black hole interior ends at a spacelike singularity or endpoint as z  . In this section, we are interested in the interior dynamics of the hairy black holes. It has been shown that the behavior will be sensitive to the details of the model because of the dynamics in highly nolinear regime [8­12]. Among all theories with NED, Born-Infeld case is the most well known nonlinear model and is quite natural from string theory. Therefore, in the present paper we will focus on the Born-Infeld theory.
The action reads

L(s) = 2 1 -

where we have introduced a new function h = f e-/2z-3 and have set d = 2 (the generalization to
other dimensions is straight forward).

A. Kasner singularity

In order to know explicitly the interior geometry, one needs to solve the coupled equations of motion from (4.18) to (4.21) numerically. The divergency near the singularity z   challenges the numerics. So we first adopt an analytic approach about the asymptotic near-singularity behavior.
We will consider the case for which the scalar potential V can be neglected. Since there is no Cauchy horizon, we have h(z) < 0 inside the event horizon and

lim
z

h(z)

=

-h0

<

0

,

(4.22)

with h0 a finite positive constant. Hence, the h /h term of the scalar equation (4.20) can be neglected at large z. The other possibility for which h(z) diverges near the singularity can be excluded, see Appendix B for more details. Thanks to the structure of BornInfeld action (4.15) for which s < 2/2, we obtain that

At2

<

e-2 z4

.

(4.23)

Since  is a monotonic increasing function, see (4.19), and is finite at zH , we find that e-/2 O(z0). Therefore, we have

|At| < e-/2/z2 O(1/z2) ,

(4.24)

and |At| is at most of O(z0). Thus, the last term of the scalar equation (4.20) can
be neglected near the singularity and one has

1  =-  .
z

(4.25)

Therefore, at large z the scalar field  is given by

 (z) = 2 ln(z),

(4.26)

5

with  a constant. Substituting (z) into (4.19) and
noting that At is at most a constant, we find that  = 22/z which yields

(z) = 22 ln(z).

(4.27)

By using h = f e-/2z-3  -h0, we then obtain

f (z) = -fsz3+2 + · · · ,

(4.28)

with fs a positive constant. Let's turn to the gauge potential. When z goes to
infinity, we have

(4.29)

As a result, at large z, we have

 = Lse/2At =

e/2At 1 - z4eAt2
2

 0,

(4.30)

with 0 a constant. Solving (4.30), we obtain

At = z-2-2 + . . . .

(4.31)

For comparison, At  z-2 for the linear Maxwell case [10], corresponding to   . One can see
that At of hairy Born-Infield black holes decays much faster than the Maxwell theory. This is due to the fact
that the Born-Infeld action (4.15) contains a square
root which constraints strongly the maximum value
allowed for At, see (4.23). In contrast, there is, a priori, no strong constraint on At in the Maxwell case.
To sum up, the asymptotic geometry near the
spacelike singularity takes the following form:

fsz3-2 dt2

-

1 fsz3+2

dz2

+

d22,k

,

 (z) = 2 ln(z),

At = z-2-2 .

(4.32)

One finds that all metric components are power laws
and the scalar field is logarithmic. By the coordinate transformation   z-(3+2)/2, we obtain

ds2 = -d 2 + ct 2pt dt2 + cs 2ps d22,k , ( ) = -p ln( ) ,

(4.33)

with



2 - 1

2 2

pt = 2 + 3 , ps = 2 + 3 , p = 2 + 3 ,

(4.34)

6

The geometry takes the Kasner form with the following relation

pt + 2ps = 1, p2t + 2p2s + p2 = 1 .

(4.35)

Hence, while the scaling of ,  and f is the same as the Maxwell case of [10], the scaling of At has a significant change due to the nonlinear modification of the electromagnetic sector. Note that to obtain the Kasner behavior we have neglected the contribution from the scalar potential. Therefore, one should have the following constraint at large z:

|V (2)|

z3+2

1,

(4.36)

which allows the potential V to be a general algebraic function, including polynomial functions (see also Appendix C). As shown in [10], when the scalar potential becomes important to the background (e.g. exponential form of potential), novel behaviors different from the Kasner form could appear. We will leave this for future study. For the hyperbolic topology, the hairy black hole with a Cauchy horizon is possible by fine tuning parameters, for which the resulted singularity is timelike. We will return to this particular case in Section V.

B. Interior dynamics before Kasner singularity

Apart from the Kasner singularity, we now consider other intricate dynamical behaviors before reaching the singularity. There are several intermediate regimes for which we will study numerically. We are interested in the effect of the Born-Infeld parameter  on the interior dynamics. We consider some explicit examples with the spherical topology (k = 1) and the scalar potential V = -6 + 2. It allows the charged black holes with asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) boundary. We also fix q = zH = 1.
For the case without scalar hairs, we can solve the system analytically and the resulted Born-Infeld AdS black hole is given by

for d = 2, accounting for the charge density of the background. µ is the chemical potential which can be fixed in such a way that At is vanishing at the event horizon zH . We call (4.37) the normal solution since it dose not break the local U(1) gauge symmetry of (2.1). For the other case with scalar hairs, one has to solve the coupled equations of motion (4.18)-(4.21) numerically.

FIG. 2. Comparison of z (up), gtt = -f e-/z2 (middle) and At (bottom) for different values of Born-Infeld parameter . The green curve corresponds to the linear Maxwell case   , while the blue and red curves correspond to the Born-Infeld balck hole with  = 20 and  = 10, respectively. See the insert for the behaviors of gtt at large z, where we have moved all curves to the same starting point at z/zH = 100 for comparing the Kasner behavior. Numerics are with At(zH ) = (zH ) = 0, At(zH ) = 1, (zH ) = 0.5 and q = 1. Other boundary conditions at zH can be fixed by the series expansion near the event horizon.

7

First, we integrate the system from the event horizon zH to the deep interior by choosing a large value of  at zH . A large value of (zH ) is to suppress the potential intricate dynamics associated with the strong nonlinear behaviors near the "would-be" inner horizon of the Born-Infeld balck hole (4.37) [9, 10]. A comparison of interior behaviors for different values of Born-Infeld parameter  is presented in Fig. 2. Apart from confirming the Kasner form (4.32) near the singularity, one finds that the dynamics inside the event horizon depends on .
In particular, the exponent  of the Kasner singularity (4.32) is sensitive to , which canbe seen from the first plot of Fig. 2 (note that z = 2 at large z limit). For gtt, one can see that it becomes positive inside the black hole and first increases as z is increased from zH . Depending on the value of , gtt will continue increasing or turn to be decreasing when z is sufficiently large. Note that gtt  z1-2 in the large z regime. For the blue curve  > 1 and therefore gtt finally decreases rapidly. For the green and red curves,  < 1 and gtt blows up, see the middle plot. In the last plot of Fig. 2, we compare the gauge potential for different . One can find that At saturates to a constant very quickly. This can be understood as follows. As (z) becomes very large with respect to z, to avoid making the Born-Infeld action imaginary, At(z) should quickly flow to zero. For the present case, At saturates to its maximum value more quickly as the parameter  is increased, and the maximum value is larger for larger .
Next, we study the possible crossover that occurs near the "would-be" inner horizon of (4.37). More precisely, the highly nonlinear dynamics in this regime would lead to the so-called collapse of Einstein-Rosen bridge for which gtt shrinks very rapidly and Josephson oscillations for which the scalar field undergoes rapid oscillations. Such intricate dynamics was argued to be due to the instability of the would-be inner Cauchy horizon triggered by nonzero scalar field [8, 9]. The instability was found to be stronger for small values of the scalar, uncovering the nonlinear nature of the dynamics. In contrast to the Maxwell case, the normal Born-Infeld black hole (4.37) can be RN like with an inner Cauchy horizon and a timelike singularity or Schwarzschild like for which there is no inner horizon and the singularity is spacelike, depending on the Born-Infeld parameter . So it is a perfect playground for us to investigate the relation between the instability of inner horizon of (4.37) and the intricate dynamics just mentioned above.
We will consider two particular cases. For the first example, we take  = 8 and At(zH ) = 2, for which the black hole (4.37) has a timelike singularity with a

Next, we turn on a small charged scalar with (zH ) = 0.1 and integrate the system from zH towards the singularity. In Fig. 3 we show the interior solutions for the first case. It is clear that at a value of z close to the inner horizon of BornInfeld black hole (4.37) gtt (green) shrinks rapidly and the scalar field  (blue) goes through a series of oscillations. The later case is presented in Fig. 4. As the normal Born-Infeld black hole now has no inner horizon, there is no similar instability triggered by the

scalar hair as the first case of Fig. 3. It is obvious that the collapse of Einstein-Rosen bridge and Josephson oscillations of the scalar hair vanish. Thus, we conclude that the intricate dynamics is associated with the instability of the would-be inner Cauchy horizon triggered by scalar hairs.
V. DISCUSSION
In this paper we have proved a no Cauchy horizon theorem for nonlinear electrodynamcs black holes with charged scalar hairs. We first extended the construction of the radially conserved quantity Q to the case with general NED. The resulted expression of Q depends explicitly on the form of NED, see (3.11). Following [10], we have shown that there exists no inner Cauchy horizon for both spherical and planar black holes with charged scalar hairs. For the hyperbolic horizon case, the method of [10] does not apply to the general NED. But we can show that for the hyperbolic case, the hairy black hole only has at most one inner horizon provided Ls  0. This result is based on the existence of the conserved charge Q (3.11) and we have not imposed any constraint on the configuration of matter fields. Interestingly, by requiring the matter contents inside a black hole to satisfy the NEC, we found an easy way to rule out the existence of Cauchy horizon for all black holes with charged scalar hairs. This result is independent of the form of scalar potential V and the electromagnetic sector L(s) as well as the topology of a black hole. In particular, without any constraint on L(s), there is no Cauchy horizon for the hyperbolic black hole case after considering the NEC.
We have studied the interior dynamics in more details for the hairy Born-Infeld black hole in Section IV. Thanks to the special form of the Born-Infeld action (4.15), we have shown that the geometry near the spacelike singularity takes a universal Kasner form when the kinetic term of the scalar dominates. We found that the scaling for ,  and f of the BornInfeld theory takes the same form as the Maxwell case [10]. The difference happens for the gauge potential which has a different scaling due to the nonlinear structure of the electrodynamics. We then considered the effect of the Born-Infeld parameter  on the black hole interior beyond the event horizon. For the normal Born-Infeld black hole (4.37), its interior can be RN like with an inner Cauchy horizon or Schwarzschild like without Cauchy horizon, depending on . We compared the interior dynamics for both cases and found that the intricate dynamics, including the collapse of Einstein-Rosen bridge and the Josephson os-

cillations, is closely related to the Cauchy horizon instability.
We conclude with a few comments given as follows. Our no Cauchy horizon result is robust in the sense that it is independent of the details of the action and the spacetime structure at the short distance. While we have limited ourselves to a minimal model (2.1), the theorem can be extended to cases with more nonminimal couplings. For example, we can modify the action to be

LM = Z L(s) - K (Dµ)(Dµ) - V , (5.38)

with Z and K general functions of the scalar . The corresponding conserved charge is given by

Q(z) =z2-de/2[z-2(f e-) - Z LsAtAt]
z
+ 2k(d - 1) y-de-(y)/2dy ,

(5.39)

Then it is easy to obtain the no Cauchy horizon the-

orem for the hairy black holes with spherical and pla-

nar topological horizons. After imposing the NEC,

we

can

that

the

combination

is

monotonic increasing with respect to z and thus re-

moves the inner Cauchy horizon.

Although we have assumed h to approach a neg-

ative constant at large z, i.e. spacelike singularity,

see (4.22), the main discussion in Subsection IV A in

fact does not depend on whether the singularity is

spacelike or not. A timelike singularity is possible

for a hyperbolic black hole violating the NEC by fine

tuning parameters. Following similar discussion, near

the timelike singularity we can also obtain an asymp-

totic behavior which takes the same form of (4.32).

The only difference is that fs now is a negative con-
stant. By performing the coordinate transformation u  z-(1+2)/2, we obtain the following Lifshitz and

hyperscaling violating solution:

ds2 = u

with L a constant. Here the Lifshitz exponent is given

by

and

the

.

Given that the Born-Infeld action is

well motivated from string theory, it deserves to un-

derstand possible physical consequence of the scaling

geometry (5.40).

While the argument with NEC is elegant in our

present theory, the application of the NEC method

9

is limited compared to the one based on the conserved charge Q. Firstly, as we have mentioned, the conserved charge method does not impose any constraint on the energy momentum tensor Tµ for matter fields. A well known example which essentially violates the NEC is the traversable wormhole. Another one is the phantom energy which is a hypothetical form of dark energy explaining the accelerated expansion of our Universe and even seems to be favoured by observations [27­30]. Secondly, the success of the NEC method needs to relate the right hand side of (3.14) to the NEC. While it works well for the scalar with the present form, the generalization to new interactions or matter fields is not guaranteed. Lastly, there are many modified gravity theories which contain nonminimal couplings that directly couple curvature terms to matter fields, e.g. ||2RµRµ and ||2RµRµ. For these theories, there is no clear definition of Tµ for which the NEC will be imposed [32]. In contrast, it has been recently shown that for general static spacetimes, one can always obtain the radially conserved quantity using the geometrical construction [31]. Then one could continue the no Cauchy horizon argument following [10].
The interior dynamics of the Born-Infeld theory was discussed for a simple quadratic potential which yields a Kasner form near the spacelike singularity. As the collapse and oscillations are nonlinear regimes that are likely sensitive to the potential, it is interesting to consider more general scalar potentials. In particular, it is worth uncovering some behaviors different from the Kasner form. In the present study of the interior dynamics, we have limited ourselves to the Born-Infeld black hole. It would be interesting to investigate other forms of NED, in particular, the ones that allow a singularity-free black hole. So far, we have considered the static black holes with a symmetric horizon. It would be a challenging question whether the theorem can be generalized to the stationary or inhomogeneous solutions.

Appendix A: Hyperbolic black hole with Ls 0

In this section we prove that for the hyperbolic blacks hole with charged scalar hairs, there is at most one inner horizon behind the event horizon when Ls 0. Following the method of [10], we first note that zI is the single root of f (z). Otherwise one has f (zI ) 0 with f (zI ) = 0. Then we find

(A1)

It is clear that Q (zI ) < 0 as Ls 0. This is obviously contradictory to our previous result Q (z) = 0.
Therefore, zI should be a single root with f (zI ) > 0. Secondly, assume that there is a second inner hori-
zon arising at z = zJ > zI . We will have f (zJ ) = 0 and f (zJ )  0. With two inner horizons at zI and zJ , we have

for the hyperbolic case k = -1. One immediately finds that both sides of (A2) have different sign. Therefore, the second inner horizon will not form.

Appendix B: No divergence of h(z) near the singularity

In this section we will show that for the Born-Infeld theory h(z) near the singularity z   is not divergent when the contribution of scalar potential V can be neglected. We point out that the discussion below will not depend on whether the singularity is spaclike or not.
We begin with assuming that h is not bounded when z goes to infinity. Thanks to the structure of BornInfeld action (4.15) which takes

with the ansatz (2.4). One immediately obtains that

From (4.19) one finds that  is a monotonic increasing function and is finite at zH . Therefore, we have

e-/2 O(z0). Then we can obtain from (B2) that |At| is at most of O(z0). We point out that in contrast to the Maxwell theory, for the Born-Infeld case we are able to give a strong constraint on the magnitude of the gauge potential by simply requiring the Born-Infeld action (B1) to be real. So the last term of (4.20) can be neglected and one has

Appendix C: Some examples of scalar potential
In Subsection IV A we have obtained the Kasner form near the spacelike singularity with the assumption that the scalar potential can be neglected at large z. In this section we will consider two typical kinds of scalar potential without above assumption a priori, including a polynomial potential and an exponential form. For the polynomial potential we can explicitly show that its contribution at large z can be neglected. In contrast, one has to consider the contribution from the exponential potential at large z.
1. Polynomial potential

with z0 a radial position sufficiently closed to the singularity. Note that

For the scalar potential in terms of finite polynomials of ||2, we assume that its dominant term is

where we have used our initial assumption that h is at large z. There are two cases for 2. The first one is

sufficiently large at large z. Therefore, we find that O(2) O(ln(z)) for which it is easy to show that its

(B6)

When O(2) > O(ln(z)), one can find that

(C2)

for O(2) > O(ln(z)) at large z. Therefore Vne-/2 is bounded. That means the potential term in (4.18)

and (4.20) can be neglected near the singularity. In-

deed, one can explicitly check that for the Kanser

form (4.32) with   ln(z), (C2) is satisfied for gen-

eral polynomial potentials.

2. Exponential potential

It's obvious that h is integrable which is not consistent with our assumption that h is divergent near the singularity. Thus, we conclude that h is bounded as approaching to the singularity.

For the exponential potential, we heuristically consider Ve = e||2 with  a positive constant. We now show that one can not ignore the contribution from
the scalar potential Ve at large z.

11

Suppose the scalar potential can be neglected at large z. Our discussion in Subsection IV A applies and one obtains the Kasner form (4.32) with  =
2 ln(z) and  = 22 ln(z) at large z. Then we have

Vee-/2 = e22 ln(z)2 z-2 ,

(C3)

which is much larger than the contribution from the kinetic term of  as well as gauge potential. Thus, for the case with exponential potential, one should consider the potential term near the singularity. It is also obvious that Ve violates the constraint (4.36) at large z and thus novel behaviors different from the Kasner form could appear.
