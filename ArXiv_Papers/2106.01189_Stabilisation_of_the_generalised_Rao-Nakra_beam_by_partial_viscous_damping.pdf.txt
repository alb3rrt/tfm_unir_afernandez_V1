STABILIZATION OF THE GENERALIZED RAO-NAKRA BEAM BY PARTIAL VISCOUS DAMPING
MOHAMMAD AKIL1 AND ZHUANGYI LIU2

Abstract. In this paper, we consider the stabilization of the generalized Rao-Nakra beam equation, which consists of four wave equations for the longitudinal displacements and the shear angle of the top and bottom layers and one Euler-Bernoulli beam equation for the transversal displacement. Dissipative mechanism are provided through viscous damping for two displacements. The location of the viscous damping are divided into two groups, characterized by whether both of the top and bottom layers are directly damped or otherwise. Each group consists of three cases. We obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the cases in group two to be strongly stable. Furthermore, polynomial stability of certain orders are proved. The cases in group one are left for future study.

1. Introduction

Several three layer laminated beam and plate models were proposed in the late 1960's and early 1970's ([14], [17] and [19]). Later, the following generalized Nakra-Rao beam model was developed in [13], where the shear effect of the bottom and top layer are taken into account.

The physical parameters 1, Ei, Gi, Ii > 0 are the density, Young's modulus, shear modulus, and moments of inertia of the ith layer for i = 1, 2, 3, respectively. The beam is composed of a top and a bottom face-

plate of respective thicknesses, h1 and h3 and a core of thickness h2. In addition, h = 1h1 + 2h2 + 3h3,

When the rotatory inertia and the transverse shear of the top and bottom layers are neglected, equations (1.1)2 and (1.1)5 reduce to the familiar Euler-Bernoulli hypothesis y1 - x = y3 - x = 0. If we consider the core
material to be linearly elastic, i.e.  = 2G2, with the shear strain

Furthermore, if the extensional forces in the top and bottom layers are also neglected, we obtain the MeadMarkos model (see [14]),

which can be simplified into a six-order PDE for . In [13], exponential stability was proved for the MeadMarkus model (1.3), when the shear stress  and shear strain  relation is assumed to be viscoelastic of Boltzmann type. When this relationship is of Kelvin-Voigt type, analyticity of the associated semigroup was proved by Hansen and Liu (see [7]), which was further extended to the corresponding multi-layers beam and plate model by Allen and Hansen in [1] and [2].

When the extensional motion of the bottom and top layers is neglected, we obtain the model proposed by Hansen and Spies (see [9]). For the model in [9], exponential stability was proved in [18] when structural damping and boundary damping are added, or when viscous damping are added to all three equation (see [16]).

In 2013, (see [20]), exponential stability of Rao-Nakra model (1.2) was obtained when standard boundary damping are imposed on one end of the beam for all three layers.

The boundary controllability problems of the Rao-Nakra beam equation (multi-layers,  > 0) have been studied

in a series of papers [6, 20, 15, 8]. In [6], exact controllability results for the multi-layers Rao-Nakra plate

system with locally distributed control in a neighborhood of a portion of the boundary were obtained by the

method of Carleman estimates.

In 2018, (see [10]) the authors considered the Rao-Nakra system (1.2) with viscous and/or Kelvin-Voigt damp-

ings. They first showed that the system is unstable when only the transverse displacement is damped and

E1 1

=

E3 3

.

Moreover, they considered seven cases of the combination of damping locations and types when

two displacements are damped. Polynomial stability of different orders and their optimality are obtained for a

particular type boundary conditions. In 2020, (see [12]), the authors considered the stability of the Rao- Nakra

sandwich beam equation with various boundary conditions. Polynomial stability of certain orders are obtained

when there is only one viscous damping acting either on the beam equation or one of the wave equations. For

a few special cases, optimal orders are confirmed. They also studied the synchronization of the model with

viscous damping on the transversal displacement. Their results reveal that the order of the polynomial decay

rate is sensitive to various boundary conditions and to the damping locations.

In this paper, we consider the generalized Rao-Nakra beam model with only two viscous damping described by

For the boundary conditions, we assume that variables u1, u3, y1 and y3 satisfy the Dirichlet boundary conditions

(1.6)

u1(0, t) = u1(L, t) = u3(0, t) = u3(L, t) = y1(0, t) = y1(L, t) = y3(0, t) = y3(L, t) = 0,

and  satisfies the clamped boundary condition

(1.7)

(0, t) = (L, t) = x(0, t) = x(L, t) = 0.

We shall investigate the stability of system (1.4)-(1.7) with only two viscous damping. The location of the damping are divided into two groups, characterized by whether both of the top and bottom layers are directly damped or otherwise. Group one consists of three cases, i.e., a, d = 0, b = c = e = 0, or b, e = 0, a = c = d = 0, or a, e = 0, b = c = d = 0. Group two also consists of three cases, i.e., a, b = 0, c = d = e = 0, or a, c = 0, b = d = e = 0, or a, c = 0, b = d = e = 0.

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present the semigroup setting of the system for wellposedness, including the necessary and sufficient conditions for strong stability of the cases in group two, and sufficient conditions for strong stability or instability for some cases in group one. Section 3 is devoted to the polynomial stability of the three cases in group two. A concluding remark is given in the end of that section.

If U = (u1, u1t , y1, yt1, , t, u3, u3t , y3, yt3) is a regular solution of system (1.4)-(1.6), then the system can be rewritten as an evolution equation on the Hilbert space H given by

(2.5)

Ut = AU, U (0) = U0,

where U0 = (u10, u11, y01, y11, 0, 1, u30, u31, y03, y13). It is easy to see that for all U = u1, v1, y1, z1, , , u3, v3, y3, z3  D(A), we have

which implied that A is dissipative. Now, let F = (f1, · · · , f10)  H, by using the Lax-Milgram theorem it is easy to show that the existence of U  D(A), solution of the equation

-AU = F.

Then, the unbounded linear operator A is m-dissipative in the energy space H and consequently 0  (A). Thus, A generates a C0-semigroup of contractions etA t0 following the Lummer-Phillips theorem. The solution of the Cauchy problem (2.5) admits the following representation
U (t) = etAU0, t  0,
which leads to the well-posedness of (2.5). Hence, we have the following result.

Theorem 2.1. Let U0  H, then system (2.5) admits a unique weak solution U satisfies U  C0 R+, H .
Moreover, if U0  D(A), then problem (2.5) admits a unique strong solution U satisfies U  C1 R+, H  C0 R+, D(A) .

Now, we shall analyze the strong stability of system (2.5). The main result of this section is the following theorem.

Theorem 2.2. Assume that (a, b > 0 and c = e = d = 0) or (a, c > 0 and b = e = d = 0 and G1 = G3) or

(b, c

>0

and

a=e=

d

and

E1 1

or

(b, e

0

and

(G1

and

E1 1

=

))

or

(a, e > 0 and b = c = d = 0). Then, the C0-semigroup of contractions (etA)t0 is strongly stable on H in the

sense that lim
t+

etAU0

H = 0.

Proof. Since the resolvent of A is compact in H, then according to Arendt-Batty theorem see (Page 837 in
[4]), system (1.4)-(1.7) is strongly stable if and only if A doesn't have pure imaginary eigenvalues, that is, (A)  iR = . We have already shown that 0  (A), and still need to show (A)  iR =  . For this aim, suppose by contradiction that there exists   R and U  D(A)\{0} such that

Inserting (2.14) and (2.13) in (2.9) and by using the fact that (0) = 0, we obtain

Using (2.13)-(2.15) in (2.10), and using the fact that y3(0) = 0, we get

(2.16)

y3 = 0.

Equations (2.14)-(2.16), implies that

u3 = 0.

Thus, U = 0 and consequently A has no pure imaginary eigenvalues. Case 2. Suppose that (a, c > 0 and b = 0 and G1 = G3). A straightforward calculation gives

0 = iU, U H = AU, U H = -a v1 2 - c  2.

Consequently, we deduce that

Remark 2.6. The first three cases of Theorem 2.2, Theorem 2.3 and the first case in Theorem 2.4 give the necessary and sufficient conditions for the strong stability of group two. However, we only obtained sufficient conditions for strong stability and instability of some cases of group one. Thus, we will only consider the polynomial stability for the cases in group two in next section.

3. Polynomial Stability

In this section, we show the influence of the physical coefficients on the stability of system (1.4)-(1.7) with respect to the locations of the damping. For this aim, we distinguish the following three cases:
· Case 1:

(A1) · Case 2:

(a, b > 0 and c = d = e = 0).

(A2)

(a, c > 0 and b = e = d = 0 and G1 = G3).

· Case 3:

(A3)

(b, c > 0 and a = e = d = 0 and E1 = E3 ). 1 3

For this purpose, we will use a frequency domain approach, namely the Theorem A.3 in the Appendix. Our main result in this section is the following theorems.

Theorem 3.1. Assume that (A1) holds. The C0-semigroup etA t1 is polynomially stable; i.e. there exists constant C > 0 such that for every U0  D(A), we have

According to Theorem A.3, the polynomial energy decay (3.1)-(3.3) hold if the following conditions

(H1)

iR  (A),

and

(H2)

sup (iI - A)-1 L(H)O ||

are satisfied. Since condition (H1) is already proved in Theorem 2.2. We will prove condition (H2) by an argument of contradiction. For this purpose, suppose that it is false, then there exists

(n, Un := (u1, v1, y1, z1, , , u3, v3, y3, z3) )  R × D(A)

with

(3.4)

|n|  + and U H = (u1, v1, u3, v3, , , y1, z1, y3, z3) H = 1,

such that

For simplicity, we drop the index n. Equivalently, from (3.7), we have

3.1. Proof of Theorem 3.1. In this subsection, assuming that (A1) holds, we shall find a contradiction with (3.4). For clarity, we divide the proof into several Lemmas.

Lemma 3.1. The solution U  D(A) of system (3.6)-(3.15) satisfies the following asymptotic estimations

Proof. Taking the inner product of F with U in H, then using (3.4) and the fact that U is uniformly bounded in H, we get

(3.18)

L

L

a |v1|2dx + c |z1|2dx = - ( AU, U H) = ( (iI - A)U, U H) = o - .

Then, we obtain the first two estimations in (3.17). Now, using (3.18), (3.6), (3.8) and the facts that f1, f3  0 in H01(0, L), we get

L
|u1|2dx

This gives the third and the fourth estimations of (3.17). By the Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequality and the facts that  and xx are uniformly bounded in L2(0, L), we get

Using the facts that u1, u3, y1, y3 are uniformly bounded in L2(0, L) and (3.19) in (3.16), we get the last equation in (3.17). The proof has been completed.

Inserting (3.23) in (3.21) and (3.22), we get the desired result. The proof has been completed.

Proof. From (3.11), using the fact that , (x + y1)x, (x + y3)x and x are uniformly bounded in L2(0, L) and f6  0 in H02(0, L), we obtain

(3.25)

xxxx L2(0,L) = O () .

Using Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality, (3.25) and the fact that xx is uniformly bounded in L2(0, L), we get

xxx L2(0,L)  xxxx 2 xx 2 + xx  O( 2 ).

Using (3.25) and (3.26), we get the second estimation in (3.24). Since   H4(0, L), then xxx  H1(0, L)  C ([0, L]). Thus, by using Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality, we obtain

Proof. The proof of this lemma is divided into two steps. Step 1. Multiplying (3.7) by xxx, integrating over (0, L) and using the fact that f2  0 in L2(0, L) and (3.25), we get

On the other hand, using the definition of  in (3.16) and the fact that u1, u3, y1, y3 are uniformly bounded in L2(0, L) and (3.24), we get

Inserting (3.32)-(3.34) in (3.31) and using the fact that  3, we get the first estimation in (3.30).

Step 2. Multiplying (3.11) by -, integrating over (0, L), using the facts that (x + y1), (x + y3),  are

Proof. Multiplying (3.13) and (3.15) by -u3 and -y3 respectively , integrating by parts over (0, L) and the facts that u3, y3 are uniformly bounded in L2(0, L), Lemma 3.17 and f8, f10  0 in L2(0, L), we get

From (3.12), we have

-iu3 = v3 + f7 and - iy3 = z3 + f9 .





Inserting the above equation in (3.65) and using the facts that v3, z3 are uniformly bounded in L2(0, L),

f7, f9  0 in H01(0, L),  3, we get (3.64). The proof has been completed

We are now ready to finish the proof of Theorme 3.1. We distinguish two cases. Case 1. If E1 = E3 taking = 3, then from Lemmas 3.1-3.6, we get
1 3

L
|v1|2dx
0

=

o(1) 3 ,

L

|xx|2dx = o(1),

0

L
|z1|2dx

o(1) 3 ,

L

|u3x|2dx = o(1),

L
|u1x|2dx

=

o(1) 3 ,

L

|yx3|2dx = o(1),

L

=

o(1) 3 ,

L

|v3|2dx = o(1),

0

L
||2dx = o(1),
0 L
|z3|2dx = o(1).
0

It follows that U H = o(1), which contradicts (H2). This implies that

sup (iI - A)-1 HO(3).
R

Case 2. If E1 = E3 and = 5, then from Lemmas 3.1-3.4, we get 1 3

(3.66)

L
|v1|2dx

=

o(1) 5 ,

L
|u3x|2dx

L

L

||2dx = o(1),

0

L
|u1x|2dx
0

=

o(1) 5 ,

L

|xx|2dx = o(1),

Using the fact that E1 = E3 , Lemma 3.5 and (3.66), we get 1 3

(3.67)

L
|u3x|2dx = o(1), and
0

L
|yx3|2dx = o(1).
0

Finally, using (3.67) and Lemma 3.6, we get

(3.68)

L
|v3|2dx = o(1) and
0

L
|z3|2dx = o(1).
0

Then from (3.66)-(3.68), we obtain U H = o(1), which contradicts (H2). This implies that

sup (iI - A)-1 HO(5).
R

The proof has been completed.

3.2. Proof of Theorem 3.2. In this subsection, we assume that (A2) holds and we set the following hypotheses:

(H3)

E1 = E3 , G3h3 = G1h1 1 3 3I3 1I1

and = 2,

(H4)

E1 = E3 and G3h3 = G1h1

3I3 1I1

and = 6,

(H5)

E1 = E3 and = 6. 1 3

We will check the condition (H2) by finding a contradiction with (3.4). From (3.6)-(3.15), we obtain the following systems

where Gh = G1h1 + G3h3. For clarity, we divide the proof into several Lemmas.

Lemma 3.7. Assume that (A2) holds and ((H3), or (H4) or (H5) holds). The solution U  D(A) of system (3.69)-(3.73) satisfies the following asymptotic behavior estimations

Then, we obtain the first two estimations in (3.74). Now, using (3.6) ,(3.10) and the fact that f1, f5  0 in H01(0, L) and H02(0, L), respectively, we get the third and the fourth estimations of (3.74). The proof has been
completed.

Proof. First, we will prove the estimations (3.76). For this aim, multiplying (3.71) by -, integrating by parts on (0, L) and using (3.74) and the fact that yx1, yx3 and x are uniformly bounded in L2(0, L), and f5, f6  0 in H02(0, L) and L2(0, L) respectively and  2, we get

The above equation yields the equation (3.76) in the both cases (H3) and (H4). Next, we will give the estimation (3.77). For this aim, multiplying (3.69) by -u1, integrating by parts on (0, L) and using (3.74) and the fact that f1, f2  0 respectively in H01(0, L) and L2(0, L), we get

Inserting the above equation in (3.78) and using (H3), (H4), (H5), we get the desired estimation in (3.77). The proof has been completed.

Proof. The proof of this Lemma is divided into four steps.

Step

First,

multiplying

(3.69)

(3.72)

by

u3xx

and

E1 1

u1xx

respectively,

(3.69)

and

respectively,

(3.72)

and

(3.73)

yx3x

and

u3xx

respectively,

and

then

using

the

same

arguments

in

Step

1,

Step 2 and Step 3 in Lemma 3.5, we obtain (3.79)-(3.81).

Step 2. In this step, we prove estimation (3.82). For this aim, multiplying (3.69) and (3.70) respectively by yx1x and u1xx, integrating over (0, L) and using Lemmas 3.7, 3.8, and the fact thats u1xx and yx1x are uniformly bounded in L2(0, L) and f1, f3  0 in H01(0, L) and f2, f8  0 in L2(0, L), we get

Using the fact that x is uniformly bounded in L2(0, L), y1 is uniformly bounded in L2(0, L) and Lemma 3.7, 3.8, we get

(3.87)

L

o(1) =

and

Using the definition of  in the above estimation, we get the desired result (3.82).

Step 3. In this step, we prove estimation (3.83). For this aim, multiplying (3.72) and (3.70) by yx1x and u3xx

respectively,

integrating

over

and

using

the

fact

that

we

get

Step 4. In this step, we prove estimation (3.84). For this aim, multiplying (3.70) and (3.73) by yx3x and yx1x

respectively, integrating over (0, L), and using the fact that

Finally, inserting (3.105), (3.100) and (3.102) in (3.80) and (3.82), we get the second and the third estimation in (3.97). In order to complete the proof of this Lemma, we need to prove (3.98). For this aim, multiplying (3.72), (3.70) and (3.73) respectively by u3, y1 and y3 and using Lemmas 3.7 and (3.8), we get

Proof. The proof of this Lemma is divided into two steps. Step 1. In order to prove (3.107)-(3.109), we need to prove the following estimations

xxx

|u3x()|,

|yxi ()|



O(

),

o(1)

|xxx()|

for i  {1, 3}

and

  {0, L}.

Using Galgliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequality, Lemma 3.8 and the fact that xxxx is uniformly bounded in L2(0, L) and taking = 6, we get

o(1)

xxx  xxxx 2 xx 2 + xx

Since   H4(0, L), then xxx  H1(0, L). Using Gagliardo inequality, we get

Since u3  H2(0, L), then

we

obtain

that

for

and





{0,

Step 2. In this step, we need to prove estimations (3.107)-(3.109). For this aim, multiplying (3.71) by u3x, integrating over (0, L), taking the real part and using the fact that u3x is uniformly bounded in L2(0, L), we get

Inserting the above equation in (3.112), we get (3.107). Now, multiplying (3.71) by yx1 and yx3 respectively and using the same argument in Step 1, we get (3.108) and (3.109).

Lemma 3.12. Assume that G1 = G3 and ((H4) or (H5) holds). Then the solution U  D(A) of system (3.69)-(3.73) satisfies the following asymptotic behavior estimations

Proof. The proof of this Lemma is divided into several steps. Step 1. The aim of this step is to prove that

o(1) 2 if (H4) holds, o(1) if (H5) holds.

Using the same technique in Lemma 3.10, Lemma 3.8 and using the fact that u3x is uniformly bounded, we obtain the aim of this step.
Step 2. The aim of this step is to prove that

(3.116)

L
u3xyx1dx = o(1) and
0

L
|u3x|2dx = o(1).
0

Multiplying (3.79) by h2 and summing with (3.107), then using step 1, we get the the first estimation in (3.116). Now, Inserting the first estimation in (3.116) and (3.115) in (3.79), we get the second estimation in (3.116). Step 3. In this step we prove that

(3.117)

L
|yx1|2dx = o(1) and
0

L
|yx3|2dx = o(1).

For this aim, multiplying equation (3.80) by h2 and summing with (3.109) then using Step 1 and Step 2, we get

(3.118)

L
G3h3 |yx3|2dx + G1h1

L
yx1yx3dx = o(1).

Now, Multiplying (3.82) by h1 and (3.80) by -h3, summing the result, we get

L
yx3yx1dx = o(1).

Similarly, multiplying (3.118) by G3h3 and (3.120) by -G1h1, then summing the result we get

Furthermore, multiplying (3.119) by G23 and summing with (3.121), we get

(3.122)

L
G23 - G21 h21 |yx1|2dx = o(1).

Using the fact that G3 = G1, then we obtain

(3.123)

L
h21 |yx1|2dx = o(1).

22

Inserting (3.123) in (3.119), we get the second estimation in (3.116). Next, in order to prove (3.114), multiplying (3.72), (3.70) and (3.73) respectively by u3, y1 and y3, we get

Proof. Using (3.147), (3.146) we obtain the first estimation in (3.155). Similarly, using (3.147) and (3.140), we get the second estimation in (3.155). Now, multiplying (3.125), (3.128) and (3.129) by u1, u3 and y3 respectively, integrating by parts and using (3.146) and (3.155), we get (3.156). The proof has been completed.

We now finish the proof of Theorem 3.3. Using Lemmas 3.13, 3.14 and equations (3.146), (3.155) and (3.156), we obtain that U H = o(1) , which contradicts (H2). This implies that
sup (iI - A)-1 HO(6).

The proof has been completed.

To conclude this paper, we give the following observations: For a system of partially damped wave equations coupled by velocity or displacement (such as the Timoshenko beam equation, the Bresse beam equation), it is well-known that the damping is more effective in the case of equal wave speeds. However, for the Rao-Nakra sandwich beam equation or its generalized version, the opposite is true. The key to stabilization is to break up the symmetry.

· When both the longitudinal and shear displacements of the top/bottom layer are damped, no condition

on the system coefficients is needed for stabilizability.

· When only the longitudinal displacement of the top/bottom layer is damped, we need the shear modulus

G1 = G3 for stabilizability.

·

When

top/bottom

layer

is

damped,

we

need

E1 1

for

stabiliz-

ability.

Appendix A. Some notions and stability theorems

In order to make this paper more self-contained, we recall in this short appendix some notions and stability results used in this work.

Definition A.1. Assume that A is the generator of C0-semigroup of contractions etA t0 on a Hilbert space H. The C0-semigroup etA t0 is said to be

(1) Strongly stable if

lim
t+

etAx0

H = 0,

 x0  H.

(2) Exponentially (or uniformly) stable if there exists two positive constants M and  such that

etAx0 H  M e-t x0 H ,  t > 0,  x0  H.

(3) Polynomially stable if there exists two positive constants C and  such that

etAx0 H  Ct- Ax0 H ,  t > 0,  x0  D(A).

To show the strong stability of the C0-semigroup etA t0 we rely on the following result due to Arendt-Batty [3].
Theorem A.2. Assume that A is the generator of a C0-semigroup of contractions etA t0 on a Hilbert space H. If A has no pure imaginary eigenvalues and  (A)  iR is countable, where  (A) denotes the spectrum of A, then the C0-semigroup etA t0 is strongly stable.
Concerning the characterization of polynomial stability stability of a C0-semigroup of contraction etA t0 we rely on the following result due to Borichev and Tomilov [5] (see also [4] and [11])
