We numerically investigate the emission of terahertz (THz) spin waves from a moving antiferromagnetic (AFM) domain wall (DW) under the magnetic anisotropy energy gradient (dEa/dx). Unlike the spin-wave emission from a spin-orbit-torque driven AFM DW motion, the dEa/dx-induced spin-wave emission originates from the DW acceleration instead of the Lorentz contraction. The DW acceleration effectuates a strong DW precession at the moderate exchange integral. When the DW precession frequency is greater than the frequency gap of spin waves in the AFM medium, a continuous THz spin wave is resonantly emitted. Because dEa/dx can be readily generated under a DC voltage, our work provides a feasible approach for the development of onchip THz spintronic devices with low dissipations.
The antiferromagnetic (AFM) medium is an ideal candidate for emitting terahertz (THz) electromagnetic (EM) waves, which have extraordinary potential application in information technology and biological medicine [1­5]. In principle, the emission of the THz EM wave from an AFM medium is due to the ultrafast magnetization precession, which is typically excited by a femtosecond pulsed laser [2, 5].
The ultrafast AFM dynamics originate from strong AFM exchange coupling between neighboring magnetic moments [2, 5]. A typical example is the propagation of a THz AFM spin wave. In a homogeneous AFM medium, the spin wave satisfies a relativistic-like dispersion owing to the Lorentz invariance of the AFM dynamics equation [2]. Nevertheless, in a real AFM medium, there can exist complicated magnetic textures such as vortices, domain walls (DWs), and skyrmions [6­ 9]. The mutual interaction between THz spin waves and DWs can effectuate interesting physical phenomena. For example, the AFM DW can modify the frequency and polarization of THz spin waves [10, 11]. On the other hand, the THz spin wave can drive the DW propagation by linear and angular momentum transfer [12, 13].
A moving DW is usually a source for emitting a spin wave. The spin-wave emission from a moving ferromagnetic (FM) DW has been widely investigated. To emit a spin wave, the FM DW velocity needs to be high enough so that the DW structure becomes unstable [14]. However, the

increase of the FM DW velocity is limited by the Walker breakdown. By depressing the Walker breakdown, a fast FM DW motion can lead to a Cherenkov-like spin-wave emission [15, 16]. Nevertheless, the investigation about the spin-wave emission from a moving AFM DW is still very few. This is because few attention has been paid to AFM DW motion in the past due to the lack of an easy driving method [2]. This has changed in the last decade owing to the research progress in spintronics and multiferroics. The motion of a collinear AFM DW triggered by spin-orbit torque (SOT), electric field, spin wave, or temperature gradient has been theoretically investigated [12, 13, 17­24] and experimentally observed [25­28]. A moving AFM DW typically behaves as a relativistic particle: the DW velocity cannot exceed the maximum group velocity of the AFM spin wave ((vg)max) [17, 29, 30]. When the DW velocity approaches (vg)max, the DW width significantly reduces (Lorentz contraction), which is accompanied by a boost in the THz spin wave [17, 29].
Up to now, the Lorentz contraction is generally thought to be necessary for the spin-wave emission from a moving AFM DW. This is because the Lorentz contraction gives rise to significant enhancement of exchange energy that can be dissipated by the spin-wave emission. Nevertheless, compressing the DW to be as narrow as the atomic size is analogous to accelerating a massive object to the speed of light. This requires harsh experimental conditions such as a large current density.
Figure 1. Schematic of calculation model: emission of THz spin wave from a moving DW triggered by a voltage-induced gradient of magnetic anisotropy energy (the emission of the spin wave is accompanied by an increase of the DW width due to the reduction of the magnetic anisotropy energy).
In this study, we numerically show the THz spin wave can be emitted from an accelerating AFM DW without the Lorentz contraction. The DW acceleration gives rise to the DW precession with frequency proportional to the DW velocity. When the frequency of DW precession is above the frequency gap for the spin-wave excitation in the AFM medium, resonant THz spin wave is emitted. The DW is accelerated by the magnetic energy gradient (dEa/dx) that can be generated by the technique displayed in Fig. 1: A DC voltage applied across the wedge-shaped insulating layer generates dEa/dx, which triggers the AFM DW to move towards the end with a lower magnetic anisotropy constant at an increasing velocity [30­33].
We consider the dEa/dx-induced DW motion in a 1D AFM chain (dimension: 252 nm (length) × 0.42 nm (width) × 0.42 nm (thickness)) that consists of two sublattices ( and ). The magnetization in sublattice () is M () (x, t) = MSm() (x, t) , where MS is the saturation magnetization of the

sublattice. For numerical calculations, the AFM chain is divided into meshes labeled i (i = 1, 2, 3....) with dimension 0.42 nm × 0.42 nm × 0.42 nm. Here we exploit the lattice constant of NiO (0.42 nm) [13].
The dynamics of the magnetization in each sublattice satisfy the Landau­Lifshitz­Gilbert equations

Eq. (1) is numerically solved using the Runge­Kutta­Fehlberg methods with an adaptive time step (the minimum and maximum time steps are 1 fs and 0.5 ps, respectively) to ensure a small deviation of m2 from 1 (< 10-10). We exploit the magnetic parameters of NiO with MS = 4.25 × 105
A/m (1.7 B magnetic moment for each Ni ion, two spin-up Ni ions, and two spin-down ions in a mesh), K0 = 3.8 × 105 J/m3, and  = 5 × 10-4 [34, 35]. J and dK/dx are adjustable parameters (J = 1.7 × 10-22­3.4 × 10-22 J and dK/dx = 200­1400 GJ/m4). The magnitude of J was obtained from
[20], which is a moderate value among the reported values [17, 20, 36­38].

approximately 0.38 THz.), (d) DW configuration at different times (t = 0 and 500 ps) under dK/dx = 1400 GJ/m4, (e) evolution of spin-wave power at a fixed distance (8.4 nm) to center of DW, and (f) evolution of frequency spectra for oscillation of nx at a fixed position (x = 22.26 nm)

Owing to the negligible total AFM magnetization, the Néel vector
= n (r,t ) [M  (r,t ) - M  (r,t )] / l (r,t ) is used to depict the AFM dynamics. Here, l (r,t ) is

the absolute value of M  (r, t ) - M  (r, t ) and is close to 2MS. In a spherical coordinate system,

the Néel vector is expressed as n = (sin cos, cos cos, cos ) ;  and  are the polar and

azimuthal angles, respectively. We derived the x, y, and z components of the Néel vector (nx, ny, and nz) based on the numerical solution of Eq. (1).
When dK/dx = 200 GJ/m4, the DW accelerates in the initial 250 ps. Subsequently, the DW acceleration decreases (Fig. 2(a)) and no spin wave is emitted (Fig. 2(b)). At a large dK/dx (1400 GJ/m4), the DW velocity continues to increase and approaches 1000 m/s at approximately 500 ps (Fig. 2(a)). A spin wave is emitted to the rear of the DW. This wake-flow spin wave is also observed from the temporal nx at a fixed position (x = 124.74 nm) (Fig. 2(c)). Before the DW reaches this position, the nx oscillation is negligible. After passing this position, the DW excites strong oscillation of nx at a frequency close to 0.4 THz (the inset of Fig. 2(c)). This wake characteristic of the spin wave can be attributed to the asymmetric DW profile or DW deformation [17, 39]. However, we can also derive this wake-type spin wave directly from the Sine-Gordon equation. (See Supplementary Materials (S1) for more details).
The spin wave emitted from a moving AFM DW triggered by dEa/dx appears similar to that under SOT [17, 29]. However, the mechanisms are extremely different. For the SOT case, the emission of the spin wave is considered as the boost of the exchange energy due to the Lorentz contraction when the DW velocity approaches (vg)max [17, 29]. For the DW driven by dEa/dx, the Lorentz contraction is absent and the DW continues to expand with a reduction in the anisotropy energy (Fig. 2(d)).
Figs. 2(e) and (f) depict the evolution of the power (P) and the frequency of the spin wave, respectively. The average P in a period (T) is calculated based on the magnetization oscillation at a

 position close to the left edge of the DW (inset of Fig. 2(e)) through P = - µ0MS3 T m  dH eff dt

dt

[40]. The temporal P indicates that the DW starts to emit a spin wave at t = 100 ps (Fig. 2(e)). The frequency spectra of the spin wave are derived by converting the time-domain nx at x = 22.26 nm (left to the moving DW) into a frequency-domain through fast Fourier transformation (FFT). (See Supplementary Materials for more details regarding FFT (S2)). The result demonstrates the increase of frequency from approximately 0.2 THz to around 0.4 THz from 100 ps to 400 ps. Subsequently, the frequency is fixed at about 0.4 THz (Fig. 2(f)).
The spin-wave emission from the moving AFM DW depends on the properties of both the AFM chain and DW (Fig. 3). First, we derived the characteristic frequency of the spin wave propagating in a homogeneous AFM chain (see Supplementary Materials for more details (S2)). Two characteristic frequencies near 0.2 and 0.4 THz were identified for a mesh at a fixed position (x =

126 nm); the increase of dK/dx leads to the redshift of the spectra (Fig. 3(a)). This frequency range is consistent with that of the spin waves emitted from the moving DW (Fig. 2(f)). The 0.2-THz nx oscillation corresponds to a uniform precession (flow), whereas the 0.4-THz oscillation corresponds to a spin wave with a wavelength comparable to the mesh size (see the Supplementary Materials (S2) for more details). The difference in K at different positions in the AFM chain modifies both the flow and the fhigh (red and gray dotted lines in Figs. 3(c) and (d)).
Figure 3 (a) Frequency spectra for oscillation of nx of a single mesh at x = 126 nm in AFM chain for dK/dx = 200 (red) and 1400 GJ/m4 (blue), (b) Oscillation of azimuthal angle () of nx for dK/dx = 200 (red) and 1400 GJ/m4 (blue) at left edge of DW (Inset: enlarged figure for oscillation of  in initial 100 ps), and lower and upper limits of the characteristic frequencies at different positions and characteristic frequencies of  as a function of DW velocity for (c) dK/dx = 200 and (d) 1400 GJ/m4
Secondly, we studied the magnetization precession within the DW, which is the spin-wave source. We found the oscillation of the azimuthal angle  in the Néel vector at the left edge of the DW (4.2 nm from the DW center) (Fig. 3(b)). Under dK/dx = 1400 GJ/m4,  weakly oscillates at a low frequency (f) when t < 80 ps (inset of Fig. 3(b)). Subsequently, both the frequency and the amplitude are significantly enhanced. f becomes greater than flow when t > 100 ps (Fig. 3(d)), which matches the starting point of the spin-wave emission (Fig. 2(e)). At dK/dx = 200 GJ/m4,  clearly oscillates with a gradually increasing amplitude (Fig. 3(b)). However, f is well below flow (Fig. 3(c)). Therefore, no spin waves are emitted from the moving DW (Fig. 2(b)). It can also be observed that f is virtually proportional to the DW velocity for both dK/dx values.
The oscillation of  indicated in Fig. 3 appears to be unique for the dEa/dx-induced acceleration of the AFM DW. For a SOT-induced AFM DW motion, the DW velocity becomes stable shortly after the initial acceleration, and  remains constant during the following DW motion at a constant velocity [17]. Under these circumstances, significant DW deformation (Lorentz contraction) is necessary for spin-wave emission. However, under dEa/dx, continuous DW acceleration results in the oscillation of . At a low frequency, this oscillation is localized in the DW region (DW precession). When the frequency is greater than the gap in the spin-wave spectra, the oscillation is extended to the region of the chain behind the DW, corresponding to the spin-wave emission.

where C is a constant that is relevant to the exchange energy and 0 is the width of a static DW [39].

The Néel vector n consists of n0 = n0 (0 (x, t),0 (x, t)) for a static DW profile and

Considering both n0 and  , the Lagrangian can be expressed as L = L(0) + L(1) + L(2) . L(0)

includes the zero power for the spin-wave component, which is an independent relativistic form of a moving AFM DW profile without DW precession, that is,

L(1) includes the linear coupling between the first power of the spin wave (  x,y , x,y ,  x,y ) and

To further ascertain the driving force of the spin wave, we derived all the effective fields at a fixed position (x = 78.54 nm) in the AFM chain (Fig. 4(a)). The passing of a DW switches the z

Consequently, the oscillating field-like torques of

act on the magnetic moment in

the AFM chain (Fig. 4(b)), resulting in continuous spin oscillation. To reveal the influence of the exchange coupling on the spin-wave emission, we recorded the P of the spin wave for a series of J near 150 ps (Fig. 4(c)). Fig. 4(c) indicates the non-monotonous variation of P with J with a maximum P at a moderate J (2.1 × 10-22 J).
Since the exchange energy depends on both J and the angle between the neighboring magnetic

moments, the enhanced DW precession at a moderate J can be inferred. At a small J, the AFM exchange coupling is overly weak to provide a sufficiently strong torque for triggering the DW precession. Conversely, at an extremely large J, the angle between the neighboring magnetic moments approaches 180º. In this case, the AFM exchange field is almost collinear with the magnetic moment and the exchange torque is negligible (Fig. 4(d)). Therefore, the damping-like torque from the sloped Ha plays a major role in rotating the magnetic moment in the DW, resulting in a rigid DW translation with weak DW precession (Fig. 4(d)). At a moderate J, however, the nearest neighboring magnetic moments cannot be perfectly antiparallel, whereas the exchange coupling remains strong. Consequently, in addition to the DW translation, the field-like AFM exchange torque excites the DW precession. When the frequency of the DW precession is less than flow, the magnetic moments in the AFM chain fail to continuously oscillate when the DW moves away (for dK/dx = 200 GJ/m4) (Fig. 4(e)). When the frequency is greater than flow, the magnetic moments continue to precess even after the DW moves away (Fig. 4(f)).
In summary, we predicted the emission of THz spin waves from a moving AFM DW driven by the gradient of the magnetic anisotropy energy. Unlike the spin-wave emission from a moving AFM DW driven by SOT, the spin-wave emission in the present work originates from the DW acceleration, and not the Lorentz contraction. The DW acceleration causes the AFM DW precession at a moderate exchange integral and the THz spin waves are emitted when the frequency of the DW precession is greater than the frequency gap of the spin wave propagating in the AFM chain.
