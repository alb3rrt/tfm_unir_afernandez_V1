We experimentally study the dynamics of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms in a 1D optical lattice with a periodic driving force. The time evolution is analysed after a quench of the driving strength which leads to an inversion of the dispersion relation in the lattice band and to a redistribution of atoms in the 1st Brillouin zone (BZ). We use the concept of a negative effective mass and the resulting changes to the effective trapping potential and interaction strength to explain the time evolution of wave packets with weak repulsive interaction. In addition, the formation of stable wave packets with a negative effective mass is observed at the center of the BZ, and we interpret these as gap solitons in a periodically driven system.

Ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices have proven to be excellent tools for the experimental study of novel quantum systems [1, 2]. In particular, optical lattices with periodic driving forces provide detailed control of tunneling between lattice sites and band structures with new, intriguing features [3]. Examples are the demonstration of a dynamically driven quantum phase transition between a bosonic Mott insulator and a superfluid [4], kinetic frustration on a triangular lattice [5], artificial magnetic fields [6­9], and topological band structures [10­12]. The systems are commonly described by the Floquet formalism, which maps the periodic driving to a time-independent Hamiltonian [3, 13].
Essential for many experiments is the control of the dispersion relation between quasimomentum and energy in the energetically lowest lattice band [14, 15]. In particular, increasing the amplitude of the driving force can invert the dispersion curve, turning the energetically highest states at the edge of the 1st Brillouin zone (BZ) into the energetically lowest states [16­18]. The resulting evolution of atoms from the center of the BZ towards its edge is usually interpreted as a result of energy minimization within the dispersion curve [19]. This is surprising because the two states in the BZ are not connected by a continuous change of driving strength, and other mechanisms such as interactions, external forces, or cooling mechanisms are required for an explanation. Understanding this time evolution is instrumental, e.g., for quantum simulation using ultracold atoms in driven systems, and the creation of Floquet condensates [19­21].
In this Letter, we experimentally study the evolution of a weakly interacting BEC of cesium atoms in a periodically driven 1D lattice potential after a quench of the driving strength. Despite very weak interactions, which are controlled by tuning the s-wave scattering length as close to zero via a magnetic Feshbach resonance, we observe the evolution of atoms towards the edge of the BZ. We find that the evolution time depends on the trap frequency along the lattice direction, and we provide an intuitive explanation for this effect by extending the concepts of group velocity and effective mass to periodically driven systems [22]. Atoms in states with a negative effective mass are unstable due to an effectively expulsive trapping potential along the lattice direction [23], which pushes them towards the edge of the BZ. Surprisingly,

when removing this trapping potential we observe the opposite effect for small atom numbers. In this case, we are able to create matter-wave packets with a long-time stability at the center of the BZ despite the inverted band and periodic driving. The states show properties similar to bright matter-wave solitons and we interpreted them as gap solitons [24, 25] with a negative effective mass in a periodically driven system.
Our experimental starting point is a magnetically levitated BEC in a crossed-beam optical dipole trap and a vertical optical lattice potential at a wavelength  = 1064 nm and lattice spacing dL =  /2 [Fig. 1(a)]. Depending on the required

2

driving frequency, we apply the driving force, F(t), by either

modulating a vertical magnetic field gradient or by periodi-

cally shaking the position of the lattice sites with detuned laser

beam frequencies [19]. For fast driving, we avoid parametric

and interband excitations [26­29] by using shaking frequen-

cies with excitation energies in the 1st band gap of the lattice.

Further details about our setup and the parameters of our mea-

surements are presented in the Supplemental Materials [30].

We use a semi-classical description of a wave packet in the

lowest lattice band to interpret our results. A driven wave

packet that is initially localized at a Bloch state with quasi-

momentum q0 moves through the BZ according to the ac-

celeration theorem q(t) = q0 +

t 0

F (t

)dt

[22], with F(t) =

F0 cos(t), where F0 is the amplitude of the force and  is

the driving frequency. We show this so-called micromotion

for q0 = 0 and q0 = qL = h¯ /dL [Fig. 1(d)]. Similar to Bloch oscillations [31], the wave packet cycles through the BZ with

Bragg scattering events at its edges. The micromotion in the

lowest band is well-defined by the parameters q0 and the dimensionless driving strength K = F0dL/(h¯ ) [22].

Time-averaging the energy over one period of the micro-

motion provides an effective dispersion relation [3, 13]

with an effective tunneling matrix element, Jeff(K) = JJ0(K), where J is the tunneling matrix element of the lowest Bloch band, and J0(K) is the zeroth order Bessel function. We label the regions with positive and negative Jeff with I and II (0  KI < 2.4  KII  5.5) in Fig. 1(b), and the regions with quasimomenta close to the center (|q0| < 0.5qL) and close to the edge (|q0|  0.5qL) of the BZ with A and B in Fig. 1(c). The change of sign and the resulting inversion of eff(K, q0) appear when a wave packet with q0 in region A spends more time during the micromotion in region
B than in region A [top of Fig. 1(d)]. The argument of eff is the initial quasimomentum q0 at the start of a driving period T = 2/, and experimental measurements need to probe the system stroboscopically at integer multiples of T .
In analogy to non-driven lattice systems, we use the effec-
tive dispersion relation to define the effective inertial mass,
meff, of a wave packet

The effective mass determines the spreading of the wave
packet [32, 33] and its response to an external force [23]. Periodic driving always increases |meff| and it inverts the signs of meff in region II [Fig. 1(e)].
The increase of |meff(K, 0)| in a driven system was observed in the context of dynamic localization of matter waves [16]. Here, we demonstrate the sign change of meff by studying the response of a wave packet to a weak force. After

(b) Position shift of the center of the wave packet for meff < 0 (blue) and meff > 0 (gray). Lines are linear fits to determine the group velocity.
loading the atoms into a lattice with depth V = 10.0(5) Er, Er = 2h¯ 2/(mdL2), the vertical trapping potential is switched off over 3 ms, and we start shaking the lattice with K = 1.7 (meff > 0) and with K = 3.8 (meff < 0) at a frequency  = 2 × 1 kHz for a total time t [30, Sec. B]. A downwards force to accelerate the atoms is applied with a magnetic field gradient in the first 8 ms of t, and we monitor the subsequent motion of the wave packet by absorption imaging in position space [Fig. 2]. We observe that the wave packet moves in the direction of the force for meff > 0, but it moves upwards, opposite to the direction of the force, for meff < 0. The velocities of the wave packets, +74(4) µm/s and -74(5) µm/s, are determined from linear fits of the position shifts and match the expected generalized group velocities ±66(7) µm/s [22, 30]. We employ this concept of a negative effective mass in the following to explain the observed time evolution of the driven wave packet.
We first demonstrate the stability of the ground states for K in regions I and II. The momentum distribution of the ground state in region I is centered at q0 = 0, and we use a stationary wave packet to study the ground state for K = 1.96. In region II, the ground state is centered at q0 = qL, and we accelerate the wave packet with a magnetic field gradient to the edge of the BZ before driving with K = 2.97 [30]. The driving force is applied by shaking the lattice (V = 12.0(5) Er,  = 2 × 1 kHz), while keeping the vertical trapping frequency z = 2 × 8.2(1) Hz unchanged. We measure the real momentum distribution instead of the quasimomentum to avoid difficulties when band mapping in a shaking lattice [30, Sec. A]. No significant change of the momentum distribution is observed over 600 ms, except for a loss of 25% of the atoms [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)].
The time evolution of the state with q0 = 0 changes drastically when we increase K to cross into region II. For Jeff  0, the strong suppression of tunneling leads to dynamic localization in position space [16­18]. In addition, we observe

the formation and spreading of a pattern of density peaks in the momentum distribution [Fig. 3(c)]. Without tunneling, the system consists of an array of independent BECs, each experiencing a different time evolution of its phase. The interference pattern that forms after releasing those BECs form the lattice creates the momentum distribution, which can show revivals and temporal Talbot effects, depending on the time evolution of the phases [34]. Such interference patterns have been demonstrated for matter waves without driving [35, 36], and we believe that the density peaks in our measurement are formed by a similar mechanism in a driven system. The patterns are fluctuating for experimental runs with identical control parameters, likely from increased technical noise due to the driving force, hence we show averaged images in Fig. 3 (see [30, Sec. D] for images without averaging).
For stronger tunneling, Jeff = -0.34 J (K = 3.26), we observe that atoms in region A disappear or move to region B at the edge of the BZ [Fig. 3(d)]. This is intriguing, because such a time evolution requires a change of the micromotion

from q0 = 0 towards the state q0 = qL [Fig. 1(d)]. While it is experimentally straightforward to enforce this change with external forces, the mechanism is unclear for periodic driving without net momentum transfer. We exclude instabilities, relaxation and energy minimization in the band as explanations by demonstrating the stability of wave packets without driving for weak interactions [30, Sec. C]. For a quantitative analysis of the time evolution, we measure the ratio between the number of atoms in region A and the total atom number, R(t) = NA(t)/Ntot(t). R(t) decreases from close to 1 (all atoms in region A) to values between 0.5 (uniform distribution) and 0.2 (localization in region B) [Fig. 3(f)].
The concept of an effective mass provides an intuitive explanation for the initial dynamics of the wave packet. Quenching the driving strength from K = 0 to region II switches meff for the q0 = 0 state from positive to negative, with important consequences for the time evolution. The evolution of a wave packet with meff < 0 is identical to a wave packet with positive effective mass but with sign changes of the external potential and the interactions [23, 37]. Driving with K in region II effectively inverts the trapping potential for states with q0 in region A. Atoms in those states are no longer trapped by the external potential but accelerated away from the trap center. Atoms in states in region B, however, are trapped due to their positive effective mass [38].
To simulate the complete dynamics, we numerically integrate the discrete nonlinear Schro¨dinger equation for renormalized lattice parameters

ih¯ t  = (1 - i)Heff,

with an effective Hamiltonian Heff in the tight-binding approximation [30, Sec. E], a wave function , and a phenomenological damping coefficient  [39, 40]. The simulation shows two stages in the time evolution [Fig. 3(e)], i.e. the initial spreading and fragmentation of the wave packet, and the subsequent slow localization of the wave packet in region B. For weak interactions, the initial spreading is dominated by the trapping potential, which accelerates the atoms and causes a rapid reduction of R(t). The duration t1 for R(t) to drop to 0.7 increases with the trap period 2/z [Fig. 3(g)]. We find good agreement between simulation and experiment when we add small atom number fluctuations to the initial state to simulate finite temperature and residual non-adiabaticity during lattice loading [30, Sec. E].
The second stage in the time evolution is controlled by the damping parameter , which simulates energy and atom loss. Without damping, the matter waves continue to oscillate in momentum space, while damping leads to the localization in region B [30, Fig. S4]. We determine the 1/e-decay time of R during the second stage with an exponential fit and find good agreement between experiment and simulation for  = 0.0225 [30, Fig. S5]. We believe that the energy removal in the experiment is caused by atom loss. Without periodic driving, we observe a larger loss of atoms in unstable regions of the BZ than in stable regions [30, Fig. S1(c)], which can reduce the energy of the system. However, with periodic driving we

4

observe a continuous loss, which is independent of the initial state of the atoms [30, Fig. S3]. This loss might mask other state-dependent loss features that cause the damping [30, Sec. E].
Another consequence of a negative effective mass is an effective sign change of the interaction strength [23, 37]. For K in region II, a repulsively interacting wave packet with q0 in region A shows the same time evolution as a wave packet with attractive interaction and effective mass |meff|. States in region A are predicted to be unstable, e.g., due to dynamical instabilities [28, 37, 41, 42], leading to a fast depopulation of the states for strong interactions [19]. However, we observe a different behaviour for weakly interacting atoms, which form stable states in region A. We prepare a wave packet with approximately 11,000 atoms at as = 5.6 a0, remove the vertical trapping potential in 1 ms, and study the dispersion of the wave packet for driving strength K = 4.2 [Fig. 4(a)]. The wave packet is initially unstable and spreads over the BZ within the first 200 ms while shedding atoms along the lattice direction. This leads to a rapid reduction of the atom number in region A and a continuous loss of the total atom number [Fig. 4(c)]. After 400 ms, a localized wave packet forms at q0 = 0 that is stable for the remaining observation time. The initial spread is reduced when we lower the atom number to 1,600 [Fig. 4(b)], creating a wave packet that is stable both in momentum and position space for the observation time of 1 s. The wave packet is almost dispersionless with a width of  = 10(3) µm at t = 1 s and a dispersion of 2.8(7) µm/s [30, Sec. F].
We interpret the stable wave packets as matter-wave gap solitons in a periodically driven system. Gap solitons are bright, non-dispersive wave packets with a total energy within the band gap [24, 43, 44]. They have been experimentally demonstrated for ultracold atoms in non-driven systems close to the edge of the band in region B where the wave packet has a negative effective mass [25], and they were predicted for driven systems in numerical simulations [45­47]. Controlling meff through periodic driving allows us to create gap solitons in other momentum states, in particular at q0 = 0 for a driving strength in region II. The observed solitons are larger than expected [30, Sec. F], which might be due to our limited imaging resolution, a small thermal background, or residual excitations of the soliton [48]. We demonstrate the dependence of the gap solitons on the driving strength K by measuring the spread of the wave packet in momentum space after a driving duration of 500 ms [Fig. 4(d)]. The wave packet disperses in region I (K < 2.4) and remains stable in region II, which indicates that it is indeed the change of signs of effective mass and effective interactions that provide stability.
In summary, we observe three characteristic patterns in the time evolution of a wave packet with driving strength K in region II and negative effective mass. First, for a strong suppression of tunneling with Jeff  0, the momentum profile shows a multitude of transient patterns which result from the phase evolution of decoupled wave packets. Second, for sufficiently strong tunneling, the wave packet accumulates at the edge of

the BZ on a time scale that is set by the trapping potential along the lattice direction. We explain this effect by an inversion of the trapping potential due to the negative effective mass and by energy removal due to atom loss. Third, a solitonlike wave packet that is localized in position and momentum space forms for negative effective mass and weak interactions. We interpret the almost dispersionless wave packet as a gap soliton for a periodically driven system. The driving provides great stability and control over motional states of the gap soliton, with new experimental opportunities for metrology and matter-wave quantum optics [49].

7 SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL

A. Experimental setup

Our experimental setup consists of a crossed dipole trap with vertical and horizontal laser beams at a wavelength of  = 1064 nm [Fig. 1(a)]. A vertical magnetic field gradient is used to levitate the atoms against gravity, and a homogeneous magnetic field allows us to tune the s-wave scattering length as with a magnetic Feshbach resonance [50, 51]. To study weakly interacting atoms, we create a BEC with approximately 2 × 105 atoms in state F = 3, mF = 3 at as = 210 a0. We reduce the atom number to 1 × 105 - 4 × 104 by changing the levitating field gradient over 3 s which tilts the vertical trapping potential and removes atoms from the trap [48]. Before loading the atoms into a vertical lattice (depth V = 10 - 12 Er, Er = 2h¯ 2/(2mdL2), where m is the mass of a cesium atom, and dL =  /2 = 532 nm is the lattice spacing), we adjust the power in the horizontal beam to provide the desired density of the BEC with typical trap frequencies z between 2 × 8 Hz and 2 × 34 Hz. The radial frequency of the vertical beam is  = 2 × 12(1) Hz, and the s-wave scattering length as is set to values between 3 a0 and 15 a0, depending on the measurement.
We create the driving force, F(t), by either modulating the electrical current that generates the vertical magnetic field gradient, or by periodically shifting the position of the lattice sites [19, 52]. The vertical lattice is formed by two counterpropagating laser beams with independently controllable frequency shifts, created by acousto-optical modulators. A frequency difference  between the beams moves the lattice with a velocity dL. We create the periodic driving force within the reference frame of the lattice by modulating  with a sinusoidal function. Alternatively, driving the atoms with a time-varying magnetic field gradient allows us to directly measure the micromotion of the atoms in the lab frame with a modulation frequency  = 2 × 50 Hz [Fig. 1(d)]. For this method, the modulation frequency is limited by the inductance of the magnetic field coils to  < 2 × 300 Hz. In all other measurement [Figs. 2-4], we use the frequency shift of the laser beams to drive the system with  = 2 × 1 kHz. The single photon excitation energy for this frequency is within the band gap for a lattice depth V = 12 Er, with band width  2 × 100 Hz and band gap  2 × 8 kHz.
The atoms are detected using absorption imaging, either after a short time-of-flight of 1 ms to allow our magnetic fields to decay [Figs. 2(a), 4(a) bottom, and 4(b) bottom], or after a levitated free expansion [40 ms in Figs. 1(d), 3(c), 3(d), 30 ms in 4(a) top, and 20 ms in Figs. 4(b) top, 4(d)]. We employ band mapping with a ramp down of the lattice intensities over 2 ms to demonstrate the micromotion in quasimomentum space for low driving frequencies in Fig. 1(d). However, bandmapping by ramping off the lattice intensity is ill-defined for fast driving frequencies [Figs. 2-4] when ramp duration and driving period are comparable. Instead, we switch off the lat-

tice beams instantly to detect the real momentum distribution of the atoms after expansion.
B. Negative effective mass
The measurement in Fig. 2 demonstrates the response of wave packets with positive and negative effective masses to an external force. We use a BEC with approximately 2,600 atoms, as = 15 a0, and z = 2 × 8.2(1) Hz. After loading the atoms into a lattice with V = 10.0(5) Er, in 150 ms, we switch off the horizontal laser beam in 3 ms, setting z close to zero. We estimate the residual vertical trapping frequency due to lattice and vertical laser beams to be below 2 × 0.05 Hz. The driving force is generated by shaking the lattice with  = 2 × 1 kHz, starting at time t = 0. The driving strengths K = 1.7 and K = 3.8 correspond to positive and negative effective masses with similar absolute values |meff/m|  13 for q0 = 0.
We apply a downwards force with our magnetic gradient over the first 8 ms of t. The duration and value of the force are adjusted experimentally to accelerate the wave packet to a quasimomentum q0  0.4 qL for K = 1.7. We continue driving the system for a variable hold time 20 ms  t  180 ms while measuring the displacement of the wave packet in posi-

The initial loss of atoms is similar for measurements with and without external trap. However, the loss slows once the atoms reach the stable region A [Fig. S1(c), red circles], and it continues for atoms staying in region B [Fig. S1(c), blue squares]. We observe that R(t) increases when atoms move from region B into region A [Fig. S1(d)].

FIG. S2. Time evolution of a wave packet for meff < 0, K = 2.43, with 20, 000 atoms, V = 12.0(5) Er and as = 4 a0 identical to the parameters used in Fig. 3(c). Here, we use a single image per time

In analogy to non-driven systems, we use the derivative of the effective dispersion relation to calculate the effective group velocity [22]

which yields group velocities of ±66(7) µm/s for the parameters of our measurement.

C. Non-driven time evolution with meff < 0
We perform an additional measurement without periodic driving to find out if a wave packet minimizes its band energy for our interaction parameters. The wave packet is initially prepared at q = qL and we study its evolution with and without an external trapping potential. Without an external trap, we do not observe an occupation of states close to the center of the BZ, which would indicate a minimization of the band energy. The distribution broadens and fragments in momentum space, but it remains in region B [Fig. S1(a)]. In the presence of an external trap, however, the atoms move into region A within a time interval of 70 ms which is comparable to the trap period of  60 ms [Fig. S1(b)]. We conclude that, for weakly interacting atoms, we do not observe energy minimization in the lattice band, but energy minimization in the effective trapping potential.
In detail, a BEC with approximately 16,000 atoms at as = 4 a0 is prepared in the crossed-beam dipole trap with z = 2 × 16.9(5) Hz and the vertical lattice V = 12.0(5) Er. We ramp down the horizontal dipole beam in 3 ms and increase the magnetic levitation field for 3 ms to accelerate the wave packet to a quasimomentum of qL. Images in Figs. S1(a) and

D. Driven time evolution with meff < 0
For the measurements presented in Fig. 3, we prepare a BEC with approximately 20, 000 - 30, 000 atoms in the crossed-beam dipole trap. The lattice depth is V = 12.0(5) Er and the modulation frequency is  = 2 × 1 kHz. The distribution in momentum space shows patterns of density peaks which spread within the first 150 ms over the BZ. The patterns are fluctuating for experimental runs with identical control parameters and we show averaged images in Fig. 3 to indicate the variations. Images without averaging are provided for reference in Fig. S2.
We vary the longitudinal trapping frequency z = 2 × 8 - 34 Hz [Fig. 3(g)] and detect the atom distribution in real momentum space after 40 ms of levitated expansion and 1 ms of free fall. For the scan of the trap frequency, we use a driving strength of K = 2.97, as = 7 a0 and  = 2 × 16(1) Hz. For measurements in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d), we use driving strengths of K = 2.43 and K = 3.26, respectively, and as = 4 a0,  = 2 × 16(1) Hz, z = 2 × 11.9(6) Hz.
To model the time evolution, we define the atom number ratio R(t) = NA(t)/Ntot(t), where NA(t) is the atom number in region A and Ntot is the total atom number. The decay of R(t) shows two stages: a fast initial drop and a slow exponential decay. For the initial drop, we use the function R(t) = A - Bt2, with free parameters A, B, to interpolate the experimental data points, and we determine the duration t1 with R(t1) = 0.7 [Figs. 3 and S5(a)]. These values of t1 are shown in Fig. 3(g), with the error bars indicating the duration for R to drop to 0.65 and 0.75. For the slow exponential decay during the second stage, we use the fit function A exp(-Bt) +C with fit parameters A, B,C. The 1/e-decay times t2 in Fig. S5(b) are given by 1/B.
We determine the atom number loss during the time evolution for wave packets initially prepared at q0 = 0 and q0 = qL. Wave packets with q0 = 0 have an excess energy 4Jeff  2h¯ × 20 Hz compared to final states with q0 = qL, and we believe that the energy is removed through loss of atoms during the time evolution. The measured exponential lifetimes are 1.9(1) s (q0 = 0) and 1.8(3) s, (q0 = qL), and > 30 s without a driving force (K = 3.26, V = 12.0(5) Er, z = 2 × 8.2(1) Hz, and as = 8 a0) ) [Fig. S3]. We observe an increase of atom loss due to the driving force, but no significant difference between wave packets that evolve from the center of the BZ to the edge, and wave packets that already start at the edge. We conclude that energy gain and atom loss due to the inverted dispersion

relation is negligible compared to heating and atom loss due to the periodic driving force.

E. Damped non-linear Schro¨dinger equation

We use a damped 1D Gross-Pitaevskii equation to model the time evolution of the condensate following the quench of the shaking [39]:

with the complex vector  whose elements are the amplitudes of the condensate wave function at each lattice site. The non-linear effective Hamiltonian, Heff, and details of  are explained below. The parameter  in Eq. (4) introduces a dissipation process that, heuristically, explains the loss of energy after quenching the driving. The dissipative model Eq. (4) has been employed to study non-equilibrium processes in BECs, such as the stability of topological excitations [53] and the dynamics following a quench [40]. In our case, Eq. (4) with a constant and spatial-independent  explains qualitatively our observations.
We apply the tight-binding approximation to derive the 1D effective Hamiltonian, Heff [54]. With this approach, the condensate wave function is modelled as a superpositions of Gaussians centred at each node, j, of the optical lattice:

The spatial dependence of the energy shift,  j, and the tunnelling rate, J±j , reflect the lattice-symmetry breaking effects of the trap.
In the non-dissipative case ( = 0), we observe that the initial state, centered around q0 = 0, evolves towards the edge of the BZ as in the experiment. In this case, the central region and the edges of the BZ become equally populated and the atoms never localize in region B [Fig. S4(a)]. Setting  > 0, we observe a significant change of the dynamics [Fig. S4(b)]. The recurrences of the wave function disappear

defining a fast time scale that is dominated by the trap period. We compare the duration t1 with R(t1) = 0.7 in simulation and experiment and find good agreement [Fig. 3(g)].
The second stage of the time evolution follows an exponential decay that depends on  and on the trap period. The values of  = 0.0225 and of  = 0.0005 are chosen to match the experimental data. We find good agreement of the 1/e-decay time t2 between the simulation and the experimental data for varying trap periods [Fig. S5(b)]. The damping parameter  is constant in the simulation, but it might decrease in the experiment for atoms in stable states at the edge of the BZ. We speculate that deviations between experiment and simulation in Figs. 3(g) and S5(b) are caused by state-dependent damping mechanisms in the experiment.

F. Gap solitons with periodic driving

FIG. S5. (a) Comparison of the decay of the number of atoms in region A, R = NA/Ntot, as a function of time. The red circles are experimental measurements with as = 7.0 a0, z = 2 × 20.6(6) Hz,  = 2 × 16(1) Hz, V0 = 12.0(5) Er and K = 2.97. The red dotted (dashed) line fits the late (early) decay of R(t) to an exponential (quadratic) function, defining a slow (fast) times scale [Sec. D and E]. The blue and black lines are numerical results of a single run and of an average over 32 realizations of the atom number fluctuations, respectively. (b) Comparison of the experimental (red circles) and numerical (blue squares) 1/e-decay times during the second stage of the time evolution for varying trap period.

(due to the loss of energy) which leads to, after a transition period, the settling of the wave function at the edge of the BZ (q0 = qL). For our experimental parameters, a value of  = 0.0225 provides a time evolution that is similar to our experimental measurements, except for a time delay of the initial spreading of the wave packet. We reduce this initial time delay by adding small atom-number fluctuations to the initial state [47]. The fluctuations are implemented by shifting the ground state wave function at each lattice site by a random real number from a uniform distribution centred at zero and with amplitude  = 0.0005. Results of a typical single run and after taking the average over several realisations with randomized noise are shown in Figs. S4(c) and S4(d), respectively.
Our numerical results show that the trajectory of the fraction R(t) of the cloud in region A has two time scales, as shown in Fig. S5(a) for a representative set of parameters. Initially, the transition from R = 1 to R  0.7 occurs quickly

For the measurements presented in Fig. 4, we prepare BECs with approximately 11, 000 and 1, 600 atoms a 1D lattice with V = 12.0(5) Er, z = 2 × 23.9(4) Hz, and as = 5.6 a0. The radial trap frequency of the vertical laser beam is 2 × 12(1) Hz. We remove the horizontal laser beam in 1 ms to allow for a vertical expansion, and shake the lattice for the evolution time t with  = 2 × 1 kHz and K = 4.2. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the momentum distribution of the evolving wave packet. The images are averaged over typically 4 repetitions.
We measure the spread of the wave packets in positions space [Fig. S6], using the expected density profile, n(z), for a gap soliton [47]
n(z) = n0 sech2 z 
as a fit function. Here, n0 is the peak 1D density and  is the width of the soliton. The width  increases slowly with 12.7(6) µm/s for N0 = 11, 000, and the wave packet is almost dispersionless with 2.8(7) µm/s for N0 = 1, 600. For N0 = 1, 600 and t = 1 s, we measure a width  = 10(3) µm and a peak density n0  20 atoms/µm. The predicted width of the gap soliton is
 = -2Jeff(K)dL = 4(1) µm, U n0
where U is the on-site interaction strength [47]. The predicted value is below our resolution limit ( 7 µm for distinguishable objects) and smaller than our measured value. We believe that the deviation is caused by a broadening due to our imaging resolution, by a small thermal background, and by residual excitations of the soliton [48].
