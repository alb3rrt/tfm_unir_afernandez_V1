## Abstract

Precise theoretical predictions are a key ingredient for an accurate determination of the structure of the Langrangian of particle physics, including its free parameters, which summarizes our understanding of the fundamental interactions among particles. Furthermore, due to the absence of clear new-physics signals, precise theoretical calculations are required in order to pin down possible subtle deviations from the Standard Model predictions. The error associated with such calculations must be scrutinized, as non-perturbative power corrections, dubbed infrared renormalons, can limit the ultimate precision of truncated perturbative expansions in quantum chromodynamics. In this review we focus on linear power corrections that can arise in certain kinematic distributions relevant for collider phenomenology where an operator product expansion is missing, e.g. those obtained from the top-quark decay products, shape observables and the transverse momentum of massive gauge bosons. Only the last one is found to be free from such corrections, while the mass of the system comprising the top decay products has a larger power correction if the perturbative expansion is expressed in terms of a short-distance mass instead of the pole mass. A proper modelization of non-perturbative corrections is crucial in the context of shape observables to obtain reliable strong coupling constant extractions.
