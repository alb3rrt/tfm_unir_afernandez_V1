## Abstract

A connection of the Wigner-Yanase skew information and multiple quantum (MQ) NMR coherences is considered at different temperatures and evolution times of nuclear spins with dipole-dipole interactions in MQ NMR experiments in solids. It is shown that the Wigner-Yanase skew information at temperature $T$ is equal to the double second moment of the MQ NMR spectrum at the double temperature for any evolution times. A comparison of the many-spin entanglement obtained with the Wigner-Yanase information and the Fisher information is conducted.
