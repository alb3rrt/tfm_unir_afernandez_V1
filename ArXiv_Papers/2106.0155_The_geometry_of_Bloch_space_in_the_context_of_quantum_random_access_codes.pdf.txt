Abstract

We study the communication protocol known as a Quantum Random Access Code

(QRAC) which encodes n classical bits into m qubits (m < n) with a probability of recover-

ing

the

initial

of

at

Such

a

is

denoted

by

(n, m, p)-QRAC.

If

cooperation is allowed through a shared random string we call it a QRAC with shared ran-

domness. We prove that for any (n, m, p)-QRAC with shared randomness the parameter p

Bloch vector representation and make use of a geometric interpretation of the fact that any

two quantum states have a non-negative overlap.

1 Introduction
A Quantum Random Access Code (QRAC) brings about an interesting example of quantum advantages that arise from relaxing the requirement that transmission of information must be faithful. The Holevo bound implies that n quantum bits cannot faithfully transmit more information than n classical bits [8]. However, if faithfulness is not required, it becomes possible to obtain quantum advantages as also mentioned in [9, 12]. The study of QRACs seeks to answer the fundamental question of how well we can retrieve information after having stored it in a physical system. The principle behind a QRAC has a very long history relative to the field of research. It appeared already in 1983 in [15] by the name of "conjugate coding" and it has even been said [5] that the inception of these codes can be traced back to late 1960's or early 1970's.
A Random Access Code (RAC) is a protocol for the following communication task: A sender (Alice) has to encode n classical bits into m classical bits (m < n) and send these to a recipient (Bob) who should then be able to use the received information to retrieve any of the initial n bits with a probability of at least p > 1 2. In the quantum version of this problem (QRAC), Alice encodes the n classical bits into m qubits. We denote such encoding-decoding schemes by a triple, (n, m, p)-(Q)RAC. We will present a formal definition shortly.
After their first introduction in 1983 in [15] these codes did not receive much attention until they were rediscovered and popularized in late 1990's in [2, 3]. Here the authors exhibit

and

with

the

latter

being

attributed

to

Chuang.

The

optimality of these original single qubit QRACs follows, for example, from Theorem 3 in [1]

which

states

that

any

(n, 1, p)-QRAC

satisfies

p



1 2

+

1 2n

even

with

shared

randomness.

In

[1]

it is also shown that if Alice and Bob have access to shared randomness, then their worst case

success probability can effectively be lifted to their average success probability

Certain general limitations of QRACs have been established. In [7] it is shown that an (n, m, p)-

QRAC exists only if n < 4m. In [10] this bound is shown to be tight in the sense that an

(n, m, p)-QRAC exists if and only if n  4m - 1. In addition, the authors obtain a similar result

for RACs, namely that an (n, m, p)-RAC exists if and only if n < 2m. Furthermore, [14] shows

that for any (n, m, p)-QRAC, we must have that m  (1 - H(p))n where H(p) is the binary

entropy function

H(p) = -p log2(p) - (1 - p) log2(1 - p).

(1)

This is known as the Nayak bound.

Recently, in [9] numerical searches have been conducted about (n, 2, p)-QRACs. The authors

find improved QRACs compared to the prior state of the art [12]. Their findings lead them to

conjecture

that

p



1 2

+

1 2n

in

any

(n, 2, p)-QRAC

since

the

bound

is

tight

when

n

For

n

>

6

their numerics suggest that the optimal success probability p drops below the upper bound and

that curiously it becomes advantageous to use mixed encoding states. In this paper we confirm

the above conjecture by proving a more general statement. We show that the average success probability of any (n, m, p)-QRAC must obey

pavg



1 2

+

1 2

2m-1 n

.

(2)

This also implies that an (n, m, p)-QRAC with shared randomness satisfies

p



1 2

+

1 2

2m-1 n

.

(3)

The above bound turns out to be new only for the case when m = 2 and m = 3 with n  16. For m = 1 it reproduces the bound from [1] and for m  4 it exceeds the Nayak bound for all values of n. To obtain our bound (2) we investigate the geometry of quantum states in the Bloch vector representation which we will return to after a preliminary section. We show how one can get surprisingly far-reaching information about this geometry by interpreting the simple fact that the overlap of quantum states is non-negative.

In the discussion section we summarize our findings by specifying the particular vector constructions in R4m-1 QRACs need to be characterized by in order to reach our bound. It turns

out, that the requirements for such constructions are slightly stricter when considering the

worst case success probability compared to the average success probability. This observation

allows us to conclude that there must exist some nmax(m) < 4m - 1 such that the optimal worst

case

success

probability

of

any

(n

>

nmax(m), m, p)

is

stricly

less

than

1 2

+

1 2

2m-1 n

.

When

comparing with the numerics in [9] we see that it is reasonable to conjecture that nmax(2) is

equal to 6.

2 Preliminaries

In the following we denote the set of N -by-N linear operators on CN by MN (C). The set of N -level quantum states is then the following subset of MN (C)

QN = {  MN (C)   0, Tr[] = 1}.

(4)

2

Also, we denote the set of Hermitian, N -by-N operators on CN with trace equal to one by HN1 (C). Given n  N, we use [n] to denote the set {1, ..., n}.

2.1 Definition of a QRAC

The initial description of a QRAC in the introduction suggests that in order for Alice and Bob

to achieve an (n, m, p)-QRAC they need a strategy consisting of two parts: First, they need an

encoding map

e  {0, 1}n  Q2m

(5)

that takes an input bit-string of length n and outputs m qubits, e(x) = x. Secondly, they need a set of n two-outcome POVMs denoted {Di0, Di1}ni=1 such that for any x  {0, 1}n we have

p  Tr[xDixi] = pi,x.

(6)

A strategy thus defined is called a pure strategy, which is synonymous with the term QRAC. If we allow cooperation between Alice and Bob in the sense that we give them access to a shared random string in order to agree on some joint strategy we get a QRAC with shared randomness. This is defined as a probability distribution over pure stategies.

One can have different figures of merit when assessing the performance of a QRAC. The one

we will mostly be concerned with is the worst case success probability. Hence we seek to upper

bound the quantity

p = mini,xpi,x.

(7)

When proving the main result we will, in fact, upper bound the performance of a QRAC with respect to the average success probability,

pavg

=

1 n2n

pi,x.

(8)

x{0,1}n i[n]

When we use the notation (n, m, p)-QRAC, we refer to the worst case success probability. And when we use the notation (n, m)-QRAC we refer to a QRAC with the usual parameters n and m but with a figure of merit specified in the particular context.

As mentioned in the introduction, it is shown in [1] that an upper bound on the average success probability of a QRAC effectively becomes an upper bound on the worst case success probability of a QRAC with shared randomness.

Note, that the sum in (8) is invariant upon the interchange pi,x  pi,x = Tr[xDixi] allowing us to rewrite (8) to get

pavg

=

1 n2n

1 2

Tr[xDixi] + Tr[xDixi]

.

(9)

x{0,1}n i[n]

It turns out, as mentioned earlier, that considering quantum states in the Bloch vector representation is useful. We will therefore review this in the following.

2.2 Bloch Vector Representation of Quantum States
Definition 1 (Set of generators). A subset {i}Ni=21-1 of MN (C) is called a set of generators if the following is fulfilled,

j = j , Tr[j ] = 0, Tr[jj] = 2jj

(10)

for all j, j  {1, ..., N 2 - 1}.

3

A set of generators together with the identity operator forms an orthogonal basis for MN (C) with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product. Thus, if  is a set of generators, then for any A  MN (C), there exists a unique vector of coefficients, v = (v1 , ..., vN2 )  CN2 such that

N 2-1

A = vN2 I +

vi i.

i=1

(11)

Specifically, v is given by

(

1 2

Tr[A1],

...,

1 2

Tr[A N 2 -1 ],

1 N

Tr[A]).

(12)

Notice,

that

if A  HN1 (C)

then

the

last

entry

of

v

is

equal to

1 N

and

the

rest

of

the entries

are

real numbers. Hence the map,   RN2-1  HN1 (C) given by

N 2-1

r = (r1, ..., rN2-1)



1 N

I

+

1 2

rii

i=1

(13)

is a bijection with the inverse map,   HN1 (C)  RN2-1, given by

  (Tr[1], ..., Tr[N2-1]).

(14)

This suggests the following definition:

Definition 2. Let   QN and  be a set of generators. Then () is called the Bloch vector representation of the quantum state  with respect to .

Since QN is a proper subset of HN1 (C), the set of Bloch vectors, (QN ), is a proper subset of RN2-1. In the remainder of this paper we will refer to (QN ) as Bloch space. Notice the following.

Observation 3. Let   HN1 (C) and  and  be different sets of generators. There exists an orthogonal operator, O such that () = O().

Proof. It is easily checked (by using the defining properties) that there exists {vi}Ni=21-1  RN2-1

such that

N 2-1

i =

vji j.

(15)

j=1

fulfilling vi, vj = ij. The ith coordinate of () can then be rewritten as

N 2-1

N 2-1

()i =

vji Tr[j] =

vji ()j ,

j=1

j=1

(16)

which can equivalently be stated as the vector equation, () = O(), if we define O as the N 2 - 1-by-N 2 - 1 operator with vji in its (i, j)th entry. The operator O is orthogonal since its rows are real, orthogonal unit vectors.

Because of Observation 3, all the following results about the geometry of (QN ) will be independent of the choice of generators. Therefore, we omit the subscript specifying the choice of generators. We will use (QN ) to denote the boundary of Bloch space. An element of the boundary corresponds to a density matrix that has at least one eigenvalue equal to zero making it infinitesimally close to an invalid state.

of the half-spaces given by these Bloch vectors, in the sense of Lemma 4, are shown. The grey

Bloch space. The small and the large circle have radius rN and RN , respectively. The distance

2 is a pure state and its corresponding hyperplane is

therefore tangent to the insphere. 3 belongs to the insphere and its corresponding hyperplane

is therefore tangent to the outsphere.

3 Geometry of Bloch space

We start this section with a lemma that provides a useful characterization of Bloch space.

Although the characterization has been given before [4] we utilize it here to provide some

intuition about the geometry of Bloch space. It will often be useful to note the following

relation between the overlap of density matrices and the inner product of the corresponding

Bloch vectors:

Tr[()()]

=

1 N

+

1 2

,  .

(17)

Lemma 4. For   (QN ), let A be the following half-space,

A = {z  RN2-1

z,





-

2 N

}.

(18)

Then we have

(QN ) =  A.

(19)

(QN )

Proof. First, let ,   (QN ). The overlap between () and () is given by (17) which must be non-negative. Hence,   A which shows that (QN )  (QN ) A. To show the other inclusion, we argue that if z  (QN ), then z  (QN ) A. Assume that z  (QN ). Even though (z) is not a density matrix, it is nevertheless a Hermitian matrix of trace one.
Hence, (z) is not positive and we can find a quantum state  such that Tr[(z)   ] < 0.
By Eq. (17), this implies that z  A(  ) allowing us to conclude that z  (QN ) A, as desired.

The boundary of the set A is a hyperplane with unit normal vector equal to   and a distance of 2 (N  ) to the origin. The geometric interpretation of Lemma 4 is therefore that any vector in RN2-1 is a valid Bloch vector if and only if, for all   (QN ), it lies in the
half-space A. See Figure 1.

5

Despite its seeming simplicity, Lemma 4 allows us to easily obtain many interesting observations. We demonstrate this in the coming few paragraphs where we review some well-known facts about the Bloch space geometry that will be useful to us later on.

The well-known fact that Bloch space is a closed and convex subset of RN2-1 follows by defini-

tion since it is the intersection of closed half-spaces. From Eq. (17) and the fact that Tr[2]  1,

we see that the smallest ball BRN  RN2-1 centered at the origin that contains Bloch space has radius

RN =

2

N -1 N

.

(20)

Moreover, a state is pure if and only if its Bloch vector has norm RN . From Lemma 4 we then get the well-known fact that the largest ball, centered at the origin, that is contained in Bloch space has radius

rN

=

2 N RN

=

N

2 (N

-1)

.

(21)

Hence the following inclusions hold,

BrN  (QN )  BRN .

(22)

The spheres of radii rN and RN centered at the origin will be refered to as the insphere and the outsphere, respectively. The inclusions in (22) coincide in case N = 2 and Bloch space becomes
the well-known three dimensional ball where orthogonal pure states correspond to antipodal
points on the sphere of radius one.

Notice also, that a Bloch vector,   (QN ), belongs to the boundary of Bloch space if and
only if its corresponding density operator is not full rank. Hence, there exists a quantum state which is orthogonal to it. Therefore, A  (QN ) is non-empty if and only if   (QN ). Let u  RN2-1 be a unit vector. The vector, urN , belongs to the surface of Bloch space if and only if AurN  (QN ) is non-empty. This means that -uRN  (QN ) since this is the only possible element of the set AurN  (QN ). From this follows that boundary points in a distance of rN and RN from the origin come in dual pairs which is also shown in [11] using
more elaborate spectral arguments.

Lemma 4 can also be used to prove the following Lemma which to the best of our knowledge is hitherto unknown. Although the proof is very simple, Lemma 4 is, in fact, the crucial observation that makes the proof of our main theorem possible.

Notice, that the upper bound of this Lemma can only be saturated for a pair of Bloch

vectors corresponding to two orthogonal pure states. For such a pair, 1, 2, we have that

In Figure 2 we show the intersection of the plane spanned by u parallel with 1 - 2 and u parallel with 1 + 2. The reason why Bloch space in this two-section looks exactly like this
is given by the following observation which is a modification of a Theorem in [11]. The proof
of the exact statement used here is included in Appendix A for completion.

This, by Lemma 4, belongs to both A1 and A2.

4 Upper Bounds on QRACs

In this section we utilize the characterization of the geometry of Bloch space given in the previous section in the context of QRACs. We set N = 2m. First observe the following Lemma.

Lemma 7. Let {D0, D1} be a POVM and let,

4m -1

Dx = (x + (-1)x0)I + (-1)x

ii

i=1

for x  {0, 1} be an expansion in terms of a set of generators. Then 0  0  1 and

Proof. Since 0  D0  I, we get that 0  TrD0  Tr(I). Combining this with Tr(D0) = 0Tr(I)

gives

that

0  0

 1.

Now,

if

we

let

z1

=

 r2m R2m
0

and

z2

=

-

0 1-0

z1

then

the

POVM

elements

can be factorized as

D0 = 2m0(z1) , D1 = 2m(1 - 0)(z2).

(29)

Since we require that D0, D1  0 we need z1, z2  (QN ). A necessary condition for this is given by Lemma 4 in that z1  Az2 which, after some rearranging, gives the restriction



2

0 (1-0 ) r2m R2m

.

(30)

The right hand side, when viewed as a function of 0, is maximized if 0 = 1 2. In that case (30) gives the desired bound from (28).

If the bound in (28) is saturated then

Dx

=

1 r2m R2m

((-1)x

r2m R2m ^),

where ^ =   . Now, notice the following:

vector. Suppose ±r2mR2mu  (Q2m) and let We then have + + - = r2m R2m I and Tr[+-]

+ = = 0.

Proof. This follows immediately from the definition of the map  in (13) and (17).

This observation implies that a POVM that saturates the bound in (28), corresponds to a projective measurement.

The following Lemma is a modification and extension of Lemma 5 in [1]. In Appendix B we include a proof of the exact statement used here for completion.
Lemma 9. For any set of vectors, {µi}ni=1  RN , the inequality

(-1)xi µi  2n

µi 2

x{0,1}n i[n]

i[n]

(32)

holds with equality if and only if the µi's are orthogonal.
The preceding three Lemmas can be combined in the following Theorem which is the main result of this work.

Theorem 10. The average success probability of any (n, m)-QRAC is upper bounded as

pavg



1 2

+

1 2

2m-1 n

.

(33)

Proof. Consider an (n, m)-QRAC with POVMs given as in (27). The Bloch vector for encoding the string x  {0, 1}n is denoted x. Thus, we find

Tr[Dixi(x)] + Tr[Dix(x)] = 1 + (-1)xi (i), x - (i), x .

(34)

Using this in (9) we obtain

pavg

Now, let Tx = i[n](-1)xi (i). Then, owing to the three last Lemmas, we can make the following estimate on (35):

(36)

where we used Lemma 5 in the second inequality, Lemma 9 in the third inequality and Lemma 7 in the fourth.
In analogy with Theorem 3 in [1] we therefore have the following corollary:
Corollary 11. Any (n, m, p)-QRAC with shared randomness fulfills

5 Discussion

In the case of m = 2 as well as m = 3 with n  16, Theorem 10 gives a new and stricter up-

per bound on the worst case success probabilities than what is implied by the Nayak bound.

Theorem

is

an

of

result.

We would also like to remark that the bound in Theorem 10 agrees with the bounds resulting

from the numerical procedure given in (6) in [13]. As noted by the authors, their findings co-

incide with the previously known bound on the average success probability of a (2, 1)-QRAC.

Their studies also include the case of a (3, 2)-QRAC where they find a bound on the average

success

which

The following observation is a brief summary of our findings:

Observation 12. The average success probability of an (n, m)-QRAC reaches the bound in

Theorem 10 if and only if it can be characterized in terms of Bloch space by the following:

if i, x + x = 0 for

all pairs (i, x).

As an example, consider the optimal, single qubit QRACs found in [2]. In this case Bloch

space is the unit ball in R3 with orthonormal basis given by {e1, e2, e3}. Let the POVM for de-

coding the ith bit be given by {±ei} in the sense of Eq. (31). The encoding states are then given

as

the

vertices

of

n

=

and

a

cube

in

case

n

=

i.e.

x

=

i[n](-1)xi ei.

Notice, that U can be chosen to be {0}, since the pure states for encoding x and x are antipodal

points on the outsphere. Hence these constructions fulfill all of the requirements of Observation

12.

We see from Observation 12 that when m > 1 we must have U  {0} since the sum of two
Bloch vectors corresponding to orthogonal pure states is no longer zero. This implies that there exists some nmax(m) < 4m - 1 for which the construction accounted for in Observation 12 is not possible:

Corollary 13. For m > 1 there exists nmax(m) < 4m - 1 such that any (n > nmax(m), m, p)QRAC fulfills

p

(41)

The findings in [9] suggest that nmax(2) = 6 since their numerical method shows a gap when

Also,

they

observe

that

when

constructing

(n

it becomes favorable to use mixed states for encoding. Explaining this phenomenon in more

detail is left open. Albeit, we would like to mention the following: One can in a straightfor-

all

of

carries

over

to

that the encoding states span all of R4m-1.

Appendix B: Proof of Lemma 9

The inequality in (32) holds if all the µi's are 0, so we assume they are not all 0. We can interpret the sum on the left hand side of (32) as the inner product of

y1 = (1, ..., 1)  R{0,1}n  R2n

(45)

and a vector y2  R{0,1}n , whose entry corresponding to bit string x  R{0,1}n is given by

(y2)x =

(-1)xi µi .

i[n]

(46)

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we get that the left hand side of (32) is upper bounded by

y1

y2

=

 2n

2
(-1)xi µi .
x{0,1}n i[n]

(47)

We claim now that

2

(-1)xi µi = 2n

µi 2 .

x{0,1}n i[n]

i[n]

(48)

Maybe we can refer to Lemma 5 in [1]. Afterall the proofs are essentially the same... This can be proved by induction on n. First, Eq. (48) holds for n = 1 since

µ1 2 + -µ1 2 = 2 µ1 2 .

(49)

Assume that Eq. (48) holds for n = k and consider the case when n = k + 1. By explicitly carrying out the sum over xk+1  {0, 1} on the left hand side of Eq. (48) we get

x{0,1}k

(-1)x1 µ1 + ... + (-1)xk µk + µk+1 2 + (-1)x1 µ1 + ... + (-1)xk µk - µk+1 2 . (50)

Applying the parallelogram identity, i.e.

u1 + u2 2 + u1 - u2 2 = 2( u1 2 + u2 2),

(51)

the expression in (50) equals

2

i[k](-1)xi µi 2 + µk+1 2 .

x{0,1}k

(52)

13

Finally, applying the induction hypothesis, we complete the inductive step as follows:

2 2k

µi 2 + 2k µk+1 2 = 2k+1

µi 2 .

i[k]

i[k+1]

(53)

Now, by inserting (48) in (47) we can conclude (32).

Recall that y1, y2 = y1 y2 if and only if y2 = ky1 for some k  R. Hence, the bound in
(32) holds with equality if and only if the quantity (y2)x in Eq. (46) is equal to some constant c independent of x  {0, 1}n. In other words, for all x  {0, 1}n we must have that

(-1)xi+xj µi, µj  = c2 -

µi 2 ,

ij[n]

i[n]

(54)

where the right hand side is constant. Now, fix m  [n]. The left hand side of (54) can be

rewritten as

(-1)xi+xj µi, µj  + 2

(-1)xm+xi µm, µi

ij[n] {m}

i[n] {m}

(55)

This must be invariant upon the interchange xm  xm. Since (-1)xm = -(-1)xm we have that

(-1)xm+xi µm, µi = 0.
i[n] {m}

(56)

Now fix m  [n] {m} and rewrite (56) as

(-1)xm+xm µm, µm  +

(-1)xm+xi µm, µi = 0.

i[n] {m,m}

(57)

This must be invariant upon the interchange xm  xm so we get µm, µm  = 0. This completes the proof.
