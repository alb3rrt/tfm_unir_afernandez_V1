We consider the problem of the formation of soliton states from a modulationally unstable initial condition in the framework of the Schr¨odinger-Poisson (or Newton-Schr¨odinger) equation accounting for gravitational interactions. We unveil a previously unrecognized regime: By increasing the nonlinearity, the system self-organizes into an incoherent localized structure that contains "hidden" coherent soliton states. The solitons are "hidden" in the sense that they are fully immersed in random wave fluctuations: The radius of the soliton is much larger than the correlation radius of the incoherent fluctuations while its peak amplitude is of the same order of such fluctuations. Accordingly, the solitons can hardly be identified in the usual spatial or spectral domains, while their existence is clearly unveiled in the phase-space representation. Our multi-scale theory based on coupled coherent-incoherent wave turbulence formalisms reveals that the hidden solitons are stabilized and trapped by the incoherent localized structure. Furthermore, hidden binary soliton systems are identified numerically and described theoretically. The regime of hidden solitons is of potential interest for self-gravitating Boson models of "fuzzy" dark matter. It also sheds new light on the quantum-to-classical correspondence with gravitational interactions. The hidden solitons can be observed in nonlocal nonlinear optics experiments through the measurement of the spatial spectrogram.

Understanding the processes of self-organization in conservative Hamiltonian systems is a difficult problem that has generated significant interest. For nonintegrable wave systems, the formation of a coherent soliton state plays the role of a "statistical attractor" for the Hamiltonian system [1­4]. It is thermodynamically advantageous for the system to generate a large scale soliton, because this allows to increase the amount of disorder (`entropy') in the form of thermalized small scale fluctuations [1­8].
The physical picture becomes more complex when the system exhibits long-range interactions, which dramatically slow down the thermalization process. A detailed understanding of this process is a subject of growing interest, in relation with peculiar features such as violent relaxation, ergodicity breaking, or inequivalence of thermodynamic ensembles [9]. In this respect, the Schr¨odinger-Poisson equation (SPE) (or NewtonSchr¨odinger equation) appears as a natural theoretical framework to study a wave system with long-range interactions. The SPE was proposed with the aim of investigating quantum wave function collapse in the presence of a Newtonian gravitational potential [10, 11]. Actually, the SPE may be obtained as the non-relativistic limit of the self-gravitating Klein-Gordon equation [12, 13], and thus describes the coupling of classical gravitational fields to quantum matter states. Soliton solutions of the SPE [14] have been used to introduce the concept of Bose stars [12, 15]. More recently, the SPE has been proposed for a quantum mechanical formulation of dark matter that would solve the `cold dark matter crisis', e.g. the formation of a cusp in the classical description of cold dark matter [16­22]. Indeed, recent 3D numerical simulations

of the SPE realized in the cosmological setting remarkably reveal that, as a rule, the system self-organizes into a large scale soliton core, which is surrounded by an incoherent structure that appears consistent with the classical description [23­30]. In other words, the repulsive quantum potential (arising from the uncertainty principle) that is inherent to the SPE leads to the formation of a solitonic core that solves the cusp problem of classical cold dark matter. This Bosonic model for dark matter is known in the literature as fuzzy-dark matter, ultralight axion dark matter, or Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter.
Our aim in this Letter is to unveil a previously unrecognized regime of the SPE. Considering a homogeneous initial condition, we show that, by increasing the amount of nonlinearity, the field evolves toward an incoherent localized state that contains `hidden' coherent soliton structures. The incoherent structure (IS) `hides' coherent soliton states in the following sense: (i) The soliton amplitude is of the same order as the fluctuations of the surrounding IS; (ii) The radius of the coherent soliton is larger than the correlation radius of the fluctuations of the IS, but smaller than the radius of the IS, see Eq.(3). Then the coherent soliton state can hardly be identified in the usual spatial or spectral domains, while its existence is clearly unveiled in the phase-space representation. Our theory provides a detailed description of the hidden coherent soliton states, which remarkably reveals that they are trapped and stabilized by the surrounding IS. Aside from the SPE context, the hidden character of the solitons predicted here has not been discussed before in the soliton literature.

There is a surge of interest in studying analogue gravity phenomena in optical laboratory-based experiments that recreate some aspects of the full gravitational system [32­ 37]. Gravity being inherently nonlinear and nonlocal, the hidden coherent soliton states predicted here could be observed in highly nonlocal nonlinear optics experiments [38­47], or alternatively in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates [48].
Schro¨dinger-Poisson equation.- We consider a general form of the SPE in spatial dimension D:

,

(1)

2V = D||2,

(2)

where  > 0 and  > 0 are the dispersion and nonlinear
coefficients, with 1 = 2, 2 = 2, 3 = 4. Accordingly, V = - UD(x - y)|(y)|2dy  -UD  ||2, with U1(x) = -|x|, U2(x) = - log(|x|), U3(x) = 1/|x|. The SPE describes a Bose gas under its self-induced grav-
itational potential V (x, t) satisfying the Poisson Eq.(2)
with  = /m and  = Gm/ , where m is the mass of
the Bosons and G the Newton gravitational constant.
Hidden soliton regime.- If we denote by ¯ the typical amplitude of ||2 and by  its typical radius, then V  ¯2 and the characteristic nonlinear time scale is nl = 1/(¯2). On the other hand, the time scale due to linear dispersion effects is l = 2c /(/2), where c is the correlation radius of the field . The healing length

 = -1 /(2¯) 1/2

then denotes the spatial scale such that linear and nonlinear effects are of the same order. The weakly nonlinear (kinetic) regime c   (or l/nl = 2c /2  1) is described by the recently developed wave turbulence (WT) kinetic theory [36, 49]. This is not the regime addressed in this work.
It proves convenient to normalize the healing length ~ = / with respect to the Jeans length  = /(2¯) 1/4, which denotes the cut-off spatial length below which a homogeneous wave is modulationally stable. The dimensionless parameter ~ = / = (/)1/2 is directly related to a parameter  = ( /m)2/(24¯G) = ~4 that has been shown to control the quantum to classical limit, i.e. the Schr¨odinger-Poisson to Vlasov-Poisson correspondence in the limit /m  0 [27]. Indeed, for ~ 1, the radius  of a gravitational structure is of the same order as the healing length   , so that linear `quantum effects' play a fundamental role and the system exhibits a coherent dynamics that is essentially dominated by soliton structures. Massive numerical simulations in the cosmological setting have widely explored this regime [22­30]: They show the formation of an IS that is dominated in its center by a large amplitude coherent soliton peak S, typically much larger than the average density of the surrounding IS, S  ¯IS, see [28]. Furthermore,

the soliton radius RS is typically of the order of the correlation radius of the fluctuations of the IS, RS  c [23­27, 29, 31].
On the other hand, in the strongly nonlinear regime ~  1, the dynamics is dominated by the gravitational interaction described by the Vlasov-Poisson equation (VPE), which is a kinetic equation inherently unable to describe coherent soliton structures. In other words, in the regime ~  1 where /  ( /m)2  0, coherent solitons should gradually disappear and the field (x, t) should exhibit a purely incoherent dynamics featured by the generation of a large scale IS [27]. The main result of our work is to show that such an IS is not purely incoherent, but still contains `hidden' soliton states: The IS with typical average density ¯IS, radius  and correlation radius c, helps stabilizing a soliton of amplitude S and typical radius RS verifying [50]:

c    RS    , S  ¯IS.

More precisely, RS   =  is the geometric average

of  and . Note that the correlation radius is of the order

of the de Broglie wavelength, c  dB, where dB  0

in the quantum-to-classical (SPE to VPE) limit [27].

Simulations.- An example of the regime (3) is illus-

trated in Fig. 1. We consider SPE simulations in 1D because the parameter ~ (or ) does not depend on the spa-

tial dimension D. The advantage with respect to 3D sim-

ulations is that much smaller values of the parameter 

can be reached in 1D. In Fig. 1 we consider   5 × 10-8,

a value that appears inaccessible in 3D, where  > 10-4

[26, 27, 30]. In other words, the novel regime (3) seems

out of reach of current 3D simulations [27].

The (x, t

initiate the modulational (gravitational) instability. The

instability is followed by a gravitational collapse, which

is regularized by the formation of a virialized IS [23­29].

Note that the localized IS exhibits properties similar to

those of incoherent optical solitons in nonlocal nonlin-

ear media [40­42]. The IS in Fig. 1(a) does not exhibit

apparent coherent soliton structures (also see Movie 1

in [50]). This appears consistent with the SPE to clas-

sical VPE correspondence. Unexpectedly, however, the

IS is not purely incoherent, but contains hidden coher-

ent soliton structures. Such soliton entities are unveiled

by a phase-space analysis of the field (x) provided by

the Husimi representation (smoothed Wigner transform)

[27, 50], which denotes the field spectrum at different

spatial positions. In optics, the Husimi transform is pro-

vided by the measurement of the spectrogram [54]. In

phase-space, the solitons are characterized by high inten-

sity spots, while the surrounding small amplitude fluc-

tuations denote the IS, see Fig. 1. The coherent soliton

has a spectral width kS much smaller than the spectral

width of the IS, kIS  kS , which means that the radius of the soliton, RS  2/kS, is much larger than

The SPE simulations remarkably show that the hidden solitons get trapped by the IS, as revealed by the phasespace dynamics in Fig. 1. In particular, the untrapped soliton labelled "5" in Fig. 1(b) is not robust and disappears at t  27 , see Movie 1 in [50]. Then the IS plays the role of an effective trapping potential for a soliton, as will be confirmed by the theory, see Eq.(6). The solitons hidden within the IS exhibit complex dynamics. Two solitons can spin around each other in phase-space thus forming a binary system, see Fig. 2 and Movie 2 [50]. The number of solitons decreases with time, eventually leading to a single soliton that exhibits an ellipsoidal periodic motion in phase-space, see Fig. 3 and Movie 3 [50].

Effective Schro¨dinger-Poisson equation.- We develop the theory in the general WT framework [4­8, 40, 55­ 60]. Because c   (see Eq.(3)), the IS does not evolve in the weakly nonlinear regime [50]. It will be described by a WT-VPE that generalizes to long-range interactions [40] the WT Vlasov equation describing random waves in

optics [38, 40], hydrodynamics [57, 61] or plasmas [62­ 64].
We describe the coupled coherent-incoherent dynamics of the soliton immersed in the IS by deriving a coupled system of SPE and WT-VPE. The soliton is characterized by a non-vanishing average  = 0, so that the field can be decomposed into a coherent component A(x, t) and an incoherent component (x, t) of zero mean (A =  ,  =  -  ):

(x, t) = A(x, t) + (x, t).

The local spectrum of the IS is the av-

erage Wigner transform n(k, x, t)

=

(x + y/2, t)(x - y/2, t) exp(-ik · y) dy. Starting

from the SPE (1-2), we obtain the result that the soliton

and IS components are governed by the coupled SPE

and WT-VPE [50]:

tn(k, x) + k · xn(k, x) - xV · kn(k, x) = 0. (5)

Eqs.(17-18) are coupled by the potential V (x, t) = -UD (|A|2 +IS), which is the sum of the coherent and incoherent contributions with IS(x, t) = |(x, t)|2 = (2)-D n(k, x, t)dk the average density of the IS.
Further insight into the coupled SPE and WT-VPE
(17-18) is obtained through a multi-scale expansion in the small parameter   ~  1: A(x, t) = A(0)(x, t), n(k, x, t) = Dn(0)(k, x, t). This scaling gives Eq.(3): c/ = O(), / = O(-1), RS/ = O(1), S  |A|2  O(1), n  O(D) and IS  O(1). Accordingly, we derive an effective SPE (ESPE) for the coherent component [50]:

where VS (x, t) = -UD  |A|2, 0(t) = IS(x = 0, t) is the central average density of the IS, and qD depends on the dimension, q1 = 1, q2 = /2, q3 = 2/3. The ESPE (6) reveals that the coherent (soliton) component experiences its self-gravitational potential VS and an unexpected parabolic trapping potential due to the IS.
Dynamics of hidden solitons in D dimension.- We describe the general form of the spinning binary soliton by using the variational approach (for D = 1, 3). We consider the Lagrangian of the ESPE (6) with the Gaussian ansatz:

where j(x, t) = ko,j(t)·(x-xo,j(t))+bj(t)|x-xo,j(t)|2+ j(t). The evolution of the phase-space coordinates of the j-th soliton (xo,j(t), ko,j(t)) are obtained from the principle of least action through the Euler-Lagrange equa-
tions [50].

FIG. 3: Hidden single soliton: SPE simulation reported in Fig. 1 (at longer time) showing the phase-space evolution of a single soliton. The soliton exhibits an ellipsoidal phasespace motion with period cnmum  1.52 in agreement with the theory, see Eq.(8). The white line reports the theoretical ellipse Hcm predicted in Eq.(7). See Movie 3 in [50].

FIG. 2: Hidden binary soliton: (a) SPE simulation reported in Fig. 1 (at longer time) showing two solitons that orbit around each other in phase-space. (b) The center of mass exhibits an ellipsoidal motion with period cnmum  1.56 in agreement with the theory, see Eq.(8) [the horizontal shift is due to the motion of the IS, see Fig. 1(a)]. The dashed red line reports the theoretical ellipse Hcm from Eq.(7). (c) The spinning period of the solitons around each other bniunm  1.43 is in agreement with the theory, see Eq.(10). The red line reports the theoretical prediction Ho from Eq.(9). See Movie 2 in [50].

Ellipsoidal motion of the center of mass.- The dynamics of the binary soliton can be decomposed into the motion of the center of mass (CM) and the mutual relative displacement of the two solitons in the CM reference frame. The equations for the CM, Xcm = (MS,1xo,1 + MS,2xo,2)/(MS,1 + MS,2), and Kcm = (MS,1ko,1 + MS,2ko,2)/(MS,1 + MS,2), can be recast in Hamiltonian form tXcm = Kcm Hcm, tKcm = -Xcm Hcm with

|Kcm|2.

(7)

The barycenter of the binary soliton then exhibits a pe-

riodic ellipsoidal motion in phase-space with a revolution

period

cm = 2/qD0.

(8)

We first comment the case D = 1 through the SPE
simulation reported in Fig. 2: The average density 0 = (3.9 ± 0.2)¯ gives cm = (1.56 ± 0.04) from (8), which is in agreement with the simulation (cnmum  1.56 ).
The revolution period (8) also applies to the ellipsoidal
motion of a single soliton where the CM coincides with
the soliton position. In Fig. 3, 0 = (4.2 ± 0.2)¯ gives cm = (1.52 ± 0.04) , which is in agreement with the SPE simulation (cnmum  1.52 ) [50].
For D = 3, the dynamics Xcm(t) lies in a plane and exhibits an ellipsoidal motion: Xcm = (R() cos , R() sin , 0) where R() = (w- cos2  +

w+ sin2 )-1/2c1-1/4 with (t) = arctan w- tan(coc1t) , c1 = 2q30/c2o, w± and co,1 being constants of the motion [50].

Revolution period for the binary soliton.- The Hamiltonian equations governing the relative position of the binary soliton, namely Xo = xo,1 - xo,2, Ko = ko,1 - ko,2, read tXo = Ko Ho, tKo = -Xo Ho, with

Ho

|Ko|2.(9)

For D = 1, the phase-space trajectory is reported in Fig. 2. The spinning binary soliton exhibits a revolution period [50]:

 bin = 4 2 arcsin(

/2)/0,

(10)

where  = 1 - (MS,1 + MS,2)/, and  = (MS,1 + MS,2)2 + 40d(0d + MS,1 + MS,2), with d the maxi-
mal soliton distance. The spinning for the binary soliton

is always faster than for a single soliton (bin < cm), as confirmed by the SPE simulation in Fig. 2 where
bin = (1.43 ± 0.04) is in agreement with the simulation (bniunm  1.43 ).
For D = 3, the motion of the binary soliton lies in
a plane: Xo = (R() cos , R() sin , 0), where u() = 1/R() is solution of 2u + u = c1/u3 + c2, where t = coR()-2, co,1,2 being constants of the motion. The orbit Xo is not closed in general and the motion in the plane exhibits a perihelion precession [50].

Discussion and perspectives.- We have reported a novel

regime of the SPE characterized by hidden soliton states

that are trapped and stabilized by the IS. The regime of

hidden solitons can be observed in highly nonlocal non-

linear optics experiments with long-range thermal nonlinearities, in line with the recent emulations of rotat-

ing Bose stars, or gravitational lensing and red-shifts

[33, 34]. The hidden solitons can be unveiled experi-

mentally through the measurement of the optical spectrogram [50, 54].

5

Aside from its relevance to Bosonic models of fuzzy dark matter, our work sheds new light on the quantumto-classical (or SPE to VPE) correspondence in the limit
/m  0: The hidden solitons revealed here refer to the latest residual quantum correction preceding the purely classical limit provided by the VPE.

Note that the formulation Eqs.(1-2) in the open

an apparent departure in the definitions of the potential U which differ by a constant. However, the substraction of

The empirical Wigner transform

W (k, x, t) = (x + y/2, t)(x - y/2, t) exp(-ik · y) dy,

(13)

is not statistically stable (its standard deviation is larger than its statistical average). It is necessary to smooth it with respect to k and x to get a statistically stable quantity. We consider the smoothed Wigner transform or Husimi function

This quantity is statistically stable for all  > 0. When the field is fully incoherent the standard deviation of W is equal to its average, more exactly, W follows an exponential distribution because it is the square modulus a circular complex Gaussian random variable by (15). A small (resp. large)  means that the smoothing is smaller (resp. larger) in x than in k by (14). A good trade-off (with equal smoothing in x and k) is achieved by choosing   x/k when the radius of n is k in k and x in x.
Relation with the optical spectrogram: The measurement of the Husimi transform is known in optics as the `spectrogram'. It is measured by performing a windowed Fourier transform by passing the beam through a small aperture (Gaussian in (15)), whose spatial position is scanned along the optical beam [54].

II. DERIVATION OF THE EFFECTIVE SPE, EQ.(6)

System of coupled SPE and WT-VPE, Eqs.(4-5)

The hidden solitons are characterized by a non-vanishing average  = 0, so that we decompose the field into a coherent component A(x, t) and an incoherent component (x, t) of zero mean (A = A = 0,  = 0):

(x, t) = A(x, t) + (x, t).

(16)

Following the usual procedure [40], we define the spectrum of the IS as n(k, x, t) = C(x, y, t) exp(-ik · y) dy, where the correlation function C(x, y, t) = (x + y/2, t)(x - y/2, t) , is defined from an average over the realizations · .
Starting from the SPE (1-2), we obtain Eqs.(4-5) (main text):

(20)

Validity of the WT-VPE: The WT-VPE (18) is valid beyond the weakly nonlinear regime [40]. Thanks to the long-range nature of the interaction, the system exhibits a self-averaging property of the nonlinear response,
UD(x - y)|(y)|2dy  UD(x - y) |(y)|2 dy. Substitution of this property into the SPE leads to an automatic closure of the hierarchy of the moment equations. Using statistical arguments similar to those in Ref.[51], one can show that, owing to a highly nonlocal response, the statistics of the incoherent wave turns out to be Gaussian.
Distinction with the Boltzmann VPE: It is important to distinguish the WT-VPE (18) from the collisionless Boltzmann VPE [27, 52]: At variance with the VPE describing a spiky distribution, the WT-VPE describes the smooth evolution of the second-order moment n(k, x) defined from the average over the realizations · .

Multi-scale expansion theory to derive the effective SPE [Eq.(6)]

The partially coherent field  is of the form (16). It is composed of a coherent soliton A(x, t) and an IS characterized by its spectrum n(k, x, t). They satisfy the coupled equations (17-18) with the long-range potential (19). The average density IS(x, t) can be expressed in terms of the spectrum n as (20). We show that the scaling regime A(x, t) = A(0)(x, t), n(k, x, t) = Dn(0)(k, x, t) described in the main text is the correct one to describe a hidden soliton stabilized by the IS. We look for solutions of the form

n(k, x, t) = pn(0)(qk, rx, st), A(x, t) = vA(0)(wx, zt),

(21)

where   1 is a small dimensionless quantity that characterizes the scaling ratios between the different characteristic length scales and amplitudes of the coherent and incoherent fields. With (21) we also have IS(x, t) = p-Dq(I0S)(rx, st) with (I0S)(X, T ) = n(0)(K, X, T )dK. We look for solutions with r > w, i.e., we

7

look for a soliton whose radius is small compared to the typical radius of the IS.

I) We first look at the equations at the scale of the soliton. If x = -wX, t = -zT , then (UD  |A|2)A(x, t) = 3v-2w(UD  |A(0)|2)A(0)(X, T ), xA(x, t) = v+2wX A(0)(X, T ), tA(x, t) = v+zT A(0)(X, T ).
We also have (UD  IS)(x, t) = p-Dq-2r UD(Y )(I0S)(Y + r-wX, T )dY .
Since r > w we can expand

After integrating by parts and using Y UD(Y ) = -D(Y ), we get

UD(Y )(I0S)(Y + r-wX, T )dY = const - qD2r-2w(I0S)(0, z-sT )|X|2 + o(2r-2w),

(22)

where qD = D/(2D), and therefore
(UD  IS )A(x, t) = constA(0)(X, T ) - qDv+p-Dq-2w(I0S)(0, z-sT )|X|2A(0)(X, T ) + o(v+p-Dq-2w).
The term constA(0) plays no role because it only gives a time-dependent phase term in (17). We require the -terms to be balanced in (17) because we look for a solution in the form of a soliton stabilized by the IS. The terms are balanced if 3v - 2w = v + p - Dq - 2w = v + 2w = v + z, that is to say, if

(p - Dq)/2 = 2w = v = z.

(23)

II) We next look at the equations at the scale of the IS. If x = -rX, k = -qK, t = -sT , then (using r > w)

(UD  |A|2)(x, t) = 2v-r(2-D)-wDUD(X) |A(0)(X, s-zT )|2dX + o(2v-r(2-D)-wD),

(UD  IS )(x, t) = p-Dq-2rUD  (I0S)(X, T ). Thus
xV (x, t) · kn(k, x, t) = 2p-(D-1)q-rX UD  (I0S) (X, T ) · K n(0)(K, X, T ) + p+q+2v-r(1-D)-wDX UD(X) |A(0)(X, s-z T )|2dX · K n(0)(K, X, T ),

k · xn(k, x, t) = p-q+rK · X n(0)(K, X, t), tn(k, x, t) = p+sT n(0)(K, X, t).

We look for balanced terms in (18) amongst the components coming the IS, because we do not look for a solution in which the IS would be affected by the soliton. The terms are balanced provided 2p - (D - 1)q - r = p - q + r = p + s, namely

r = (p - (D - 2)q)/2 and s = (p - Dq)/2.

(24)

8

III) Conclusion: Without loss of generality, we can choose the reference length scale to be the radius of the soliton, that is to say, we can choose w = 0. Then we get balanced terms in equations in (17) and (18) provided conditions (23) and (24) are satisfied, which means

w = v = s = z = 0, q = r > 0, p = Dq.

(25)

In this case we can check that p + q + 2v - r(1 - D) - wD = 2Dq > (2D - 1)q = 2p - r, which shows that the soliton has no influence on the IS:

xV · kn(k, x, t) = DqX UD  (I0S) (X, T ) · K n(0)(K, X, T ) + o(Dq).

We can take without loss of generality q = r = 1 and p = D, because the small dimensionless parameter  is arbitrary. We then obtain A(x, t) = A(0)(x, t), n(k, x, t) = Dn(0)(k, x, t), the SPE (17) takes the form

(26)

that is to say the effective SPE Eq.(6) (main text), and the WT-VPE (18) takes the form (with X = x and K = k)

tn(0)(K, X, t) + K · X n(0)(K, X, t) + X (UD  (I0S))(X, t) · Kn(0)(K, X, t) = 0.

(27)

This rescaled form of the WT-VPE does not depend on the coherent component, i.e., on the soliton dynamics.

Justification of the scale separations of the new regime Eq.(3): The scaling A(x, t) = A(0)(x, t), n(k, x, t) = Dn(0)(k, x, t) also implies all of the separation of spatial scales involved in the new regime reported in our work, namely ~ = / = , c/ = O(), / = O(-1), RS/ = O(1), |A|2  O(1), n  D and IS  1. This gives

III. BINARY SOLITON: 3D DYNAMICS AND DERIVATION OF EQS.(7-10)

where VS (x, t) = - UD(x - y)|A|2(y, t)dy, with q1 = 1, q3 = 2/3, U1(x) = -|x|, U3(x) = 1/|x|, and 0(t) = IS(x = 0, t) is the average density of the incoherent structure at the center. We consider the Gaussian ansatz for a two-component soliton:

The effective Lagrangian depends on aj(t), Rj(t), bj(t), j(t), xo,j(t) and ko,j(t) and their time derivatives. It can be split into three parts. The first two parts depend on each of the components of the coherent structure, the third part represents the interaction between the two components L = L1 + L2 + L12:

where MS,j = a2j D/2RjD is the mass of the j-th component of the coherent structure and we have assumed that |xo,1 - xo,2|  R1, R2 in order to simplify L12. The evolution equations for the parameters of the ansatz are then

derived from the effective Lagrangian by using the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations  Ldt = 0 [53]. We obtain the closed-form ordinary differential equation for the width Rj of the j-th component of the coherent structure:

FIG. 4: Perihelion precession of the 3D binary soliton: Planar trajectory of the relative motion of the bisoliton Xo(t) for t  [0, 10o], Xo(0) = (Ro, 0, 0), tXo(0) · Xo(0) = 0, co = tXo(0) · Xo(0) = Ro2/o, and for different values of (c1, c2).

Relative motion of the binary soliton
The relative motion of the binary soliton is defined from Xo = xo,1 - xo,2, Ko = ko,1 - ko,2, which satisfies tXo = Ko Ho = Ko, tKo = -Xo Ho = -2qD0Xo - (MS,1 + MS,2)Xo/|Xo|D,
with the conserved Hamiltonian Ho = qD0|Xo|2 + (MS,1 + MS,2)|Xo|2-D + |Ko|2/2.

The case D = 1: Revolution period bin of the binary soliton

The trajectory has the form of two half ellipses connected through two points that present a small cusp. The relative motion of the binary soliton is then periodic in phase-space with a revolution period

 bin = 22

(E) 0

with U (x) = 0x2 + (MS,1 + MS,2)x and (E) = - (MS,1 + MS,2) + 2(MS,1 + MS,2)2 + 40E /(20). The integration gives Eq.(10) (main text).

is a constant of motion, and c1 = 2qD0/c2o, c2 = (MS,1 + MS,2)/c2o. Note that the function u or R is periodic in , but its period is not 2 (it is 2 if c1 = 0 or c2 = 0). Then the relative motion of the binary soliton is not a closed
orbit and it is not periodic, except for some exceptional values of the parameters, see Fig. 4.

Computation of the revolution periods of the single soliton and binary soliton in SPE simulations
The evaluation in the simulations of the revolution period of the single soliton in Fig. 3 and of the center of mass of the binary soliton in Fig. 2 requires the computation of the density 0 of the incoherent structure, as well as the mass(es) of the soliton(s) MS,(j). The soliton mass is computed in phase-space from the Husimi function W (k, x, t). In the case of Fig. 3, we obtain MS/M = 0.039 ± 0.002; in the case of Fig. 2, MS,1/M = 0.037 ± 0.002, MS,2/M = 0.025 ± 0.002. The uncertainties on the masses are determined from the variance of the fluctuations over the relevant time interval. 0 is retrieved by computing the spatial and temporal averages of |(x, t)|2 over a small

11
spatial window xw  7.5 and the relevant time interval. In order to account solely for the contribution of the IS component, we have removed the contribution of the soliton mass(es) MS,(j) to the computation of 0. In the case of Fig. 3, we obtain 0/¯ = 4.2 ± 0.2; in Fig. 2 0/¯ = 3.9 ± 0.2 (the uncertainties being determined from the variance of the fluctuations). This gives for the single soliton of Fig. 3 cm/ = 1.52 ± 0.04; and for the binary soliton of Fig. 2 cm/ = 1.56 ± 0.04, and bin/ = 1.43 ± 0.04. These values are in agreement with those observed in the SPE simulations (see the main text: cnmum/ = 1.52 for Fig. 3; cnmum/ = 1.56, and bniunm/ = 1.43 for Fig. 2).
