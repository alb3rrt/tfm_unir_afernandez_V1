The nonsymmorphic Zr2Ir alloy is a possible topological semimetal candidate material and as such may be part of an exotic class of superconductors. Zr2Ir is a superconductor with a transition temperature of 7.4 K with critical fields of 19.6(3) mT and 3.79(3) T, as determined by heat capacity and magnetisation. Zero field muon spin relaxation measurements show that time-reversal symmetry is preserved in these materials. The specific heat and transverse field muon spin rotation measurements rule out any possibility to have a nodal or anisotropic superconducting gap, revealing a conventional s-wave nature in the superconducting ground state. Therefore, this system is found to be conventional nonsymmorphic superconductor, with time-reversal symmetry being preserved and an isotropic superconducting gap.

I. INTRODUCTION

with topologically protected surface states.

Topological superconductors (TSCs) have emerged as an exciting exotic class of unconventional superconductors. These materials have a nontrivial topology with a superconducting gap in the bulk but with topologically protected states at the surfaces [1­6]. These surface states can host Majorana fermions, which may lead to possible applications for in fault-tolerant quantum computation [1, 2]. The search for new TSCs is currently a central challenge in quantum materials research. However, despite tremendous research activity, only a handful of compounds are reported as a potential candidate to bulk topological superconductors, including Sr2RuO4 [7, 8], Au2Pb [9], PbTaSe2 [10], BiPd [11], -PdBi2 [12], and MoTe2 [13].
Recently, experimental studies performed on theoretically predicted topological binary and ternary superconducting compounds, such as: NbC, TaC [14], and A15 Ti3X (X = Ir, Sb) [15, 16], ZrRuAs [17], Kagome flat band LaRu3Si2 [18] have shown conventional s-wave superconductivity with preserved time-reversal symmetry (TRS). In contrast, multi-gap superconductivity has been reported in the topological superconducting candidate TaOsSi [19] and TRS is preserved. For RRuB2 (R = Y, Lu), s-wave superconductivity with spin fluctuations has been reported[20, 21]. These studies failed to provide the role of the nontrivial surface state on superconducting ground states. The limited number of topological superconductors makes it challenging to determine the exact superconducting pairing mechanism and role of topological surface states on superconducting properties. It is essential to discover new materials or study the existing ones to look for superconductivity

In this paper, a detailed study of the superconducting properties of the nonsymmorphic alloy (space group I4/mcm, No. 140) Zr2Ir using magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, heat capacity and muon-spin rotation/relaxation (µSR) techniques. Recent work has revealed that the nonsymmorphic symmetry can host novel topological phases [22] and topological superconductivity, thus making Zr2Ir an ideal candidate material. Initial band structure calculations have revealed that Zr2Ir is a topological semi-metal with a symmetry enforced Fermi level degeneracy at high symmetry points [23, 24]. A symmetry-enforced topological semi-metal may hold low-energy excitations and reveal novel topological response phenomena and unusual magneto-transport properties [25]. Several bands close to the Fermi surface with distinct electron masses can lead to different electronphonon coupling strengths, which results in different gap energies. This can promote an exotic superconducting ground state depending on the strength of inter and intra-band coupling [26]. So, it is very intriguing and timely to study the superconducting ground state and time-reversal symmetry in Zr2Ir alloy. Our results show that Zr2Ir can be described as fully gapped s-wave order parameters and preserved time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state. Interestingly, the Uemura plot suggests Zr2Ir lie in the vicinity of Zr3Ir and other unconventional superconductors, which break time-reversal symmetry [27­29].
II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
A polycrystalline sample of Zr2Ir was made using a stoichiometric mixture of Zr (99.99 %) and Ir (99.97 %) by standard arc melting method under a high purity argon gas atmosphere. The sample was flipped and remelted several times to improve the chemical homogeneity. The

resulting 'button' had negligible mass loss during this process, and was annealed at 750 C for three days in vacuum-sealed quartz tube. Room temperature powder X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data was collected using a PANalytical X,pert Pro diffractometer using Cu K radiation ( = 1.54056 Å). The DC susceptibility measurements were performed using a MPMS3 (Quantum Design). Resistivity and specific heat measurements were performed in the Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design). The µSR measurements were carried out at the ISIS pulsed neutron and muon source at the STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, United Kingdom using the MuSR spectrometer. Zero-field muon spin relaxation (ZF-µSR) measurements were performed in the temperature range 0.3 - 10 K. The transverse-field muon spin rotation (TF-µSR) measurements were performed at 60 mT, well above the lower critical field HC1(0). We have analyzed the µSR data [30] using the Mantid software.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Rietveld refinement of the room temperature XRD pattern was performed using the FullProf software package [31]. This confirmed the phase purity of the sample with negligible Zr, or any other, impurity. The crystal structure was confirmed as the tetragonal CuAl2 type with space group I4/mcm (space group no - 140). The refined XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 1. The refined lattice parameters are summarized in Table I.
The magnetization was measured in both zero-field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) mode with an applied field, H = 1 mT. These measurement confirms bulk superconductivity at TC = 7.4(1) K (Fig. 2(a)) with 100% superconducting volume fraction. AC susceptibility measurements further confirm the superconductivity at 7.4 K and is shown in Fig. 2(b).
The temperature dependence of the resistivity were measured in a range of different applied fields, from zero to 6 T, and is shown in Fig. 3. It also confirms the presence of superconductivity (inset of Fig. 3 (a)). The

The value of D is close to that obtained from the specific heat data (described later).

The magnetization was also measured with different magnetic fields over a temperature range of 1.8 K  T  10 K, in order to determine the upper critical field, HC2(0). Values for HC2(T) were determined by taking the onset temperature as the criteria for TC. Fig. 5 (b) shows the upper critical field as a function of temperature. The data were fitted using the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) formula

HC2(T ) = HC2(0) (1 + t2)

where t = T/TC and gives Hm C2ag(0) = 3.79(3) T. We have also calculated HC2(T) by using the same relation (??)

from the specific heat and resistivity data collected at

different fields, which gives slightly higher HC2(0) value

Cel was extracted from the total specific heat using the relation Cel = C - T3. The Cel data is best described by

a conventional s-wave model and gives a superconducting

gap value of

(0) kB TC

= 1.99(1) indicating an isotropic super-

conducting gap at the Fermi surface [35]. The obtained

superconducting gap value is greater than the BCS pre-

dicted value (1.76). We have extracted Cel for different

applied magnetic fields and the data was fitted for each

field using the

an isotropic gap [37, 38].

The strength of the attractive interaction between the

electrons and phonons (e-ph) was calculated using the

McMillan equation [39] and was found to be 0.83(1) indi-

cating that Zr2Ir is a moderately coupled superconductor

similar to superconducting topological candidate materi-

als, such as: Ti3Ir and Ti3Sb [16]. All the supercon-

ducting and normal state parameters are summarized in

Table II.

To further explore the superconducting gap struc-

ture, transverse field muon spin rotation (TF-µSR) spec-

troscopy measurements were taken at different tempera-

tures with an applied field of 60 mT. The applied field en-

sures a well-ordered flux line lattice at temperatures be-

low TC as the applied field is greater than HC (0). Fig. 7

(a) and (c) shows the TF-µSR spectra above and below

the superconducting transition temperature. The typi-

cal Maximum Entropy analysis results of the magnetic

field distribution, extracted from the TF-µSR time spec-

tra, are shown in the Fig. 7 (b) mixed state, and (d)

normal state [40]. The normal state spectra shows a ho-

mogeneous field distribution, whereas the spectra in the

superconducting state show strong depolarization. This

nature specifies the formation of inhomogeneous field dis-

tribution in the flux line lattice (FLL) state.

The decaying Gaussian oscillatory function (GT F (t))

best fit the TF-spectra, which consists of two decay com-

ponents (5). An oscillatory background term was also

added to account for the effect of the muons implanted

directly into the silver sample holder which does not de-

polarize (5). Abg and Bbg are the background contribu-

tions for the asymmetry and the field, respectively.

tive depolarization rate,  was extracted by fitting the

dipolar moments (N) and field variation across the flux

line lattice (sc). We have extracted sc by the quadratic relation 2 = s2c + N2 . The sc increases systematically with decreasing temperature and saturates at the lowest

temperatures and is shown in Fig. 8 (b). This result sug-

gests that Zr3Ir does not exhibit line or point node and

has an isotropic gap, in agreement with the heat capacity

results. The data were fitted within the local London ap-

proximation for a BCS superconductor in the clean limit

[42] which yields the superconducting energy gap (0) is

To investigate the presence of a spontaneous magnetic field in the sample, we have collected ZF-µSR spectra at temperatures above and below the superconducting transition temperature. The asymmetry spectra were best fitted by static Kubo-Toyabe function multiplied by an exponential decay component [45] is given by

ABG is background contribution associated with muon stopping in the silver sample holder. Fig. 9 shows no change in observed zero-field asymmetry spectra within the detection limit of µSR. This confirms the absence of any spontaneous magnetic field and a preserved time reversal symmetry in Zr2Ir.

semimetal Zr2Ir having nonsymmorphic crystal structure. It shows the bulk type-II superconductivity with

transition temperature TC = 7.4(1) K with the lower and upper critical field as 19.6(3) mT and 3.79(3) T, respec-

tively. Specific heat measurements exhibit that supercon-

greater than BCS

predicted value (1.76). Transverse field µSR measure-

ments further confirm the superconducting energy gap
