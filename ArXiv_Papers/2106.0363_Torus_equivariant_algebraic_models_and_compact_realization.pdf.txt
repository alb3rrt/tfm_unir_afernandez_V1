Abstract
Let T be a compact torus. We prove that, up to equivariant rational equivalence, the category of T -simply connected, T -finite type T -spaces with finitely many isotropy types is completely described by certain finite systems of commutative differential graded algebras with consistent choices of degree 2 cohomology classes. We show that the algebraic systems corresponding to finite T -CW-complexes are exactly those which satisfy the necessary condition imposed by the Borel localization theorem along with certain finiteness conditions. We derive an algebraic characterization of when an algebra over a polyonmial ring is realized as the rational equivariant cohomology of a finite T -CW-complex. As further applications we prove that any GKM graph cohomology is realized by a finite T -CW-complex and classify equivariant cohomology algebras of finite S1-CW-complexes with discrete fixed points.
1 Introduction
A core question in algebraic topology is whether a given ring is realizable as the cohomology ring of a space. While this is a widely open question for integral cohomology, it was proved in [16] that any nonnegatively graded, finite type, commutative algebra A over Q with A0 = Q, A1 = 0 is realizable as A = H(X; Q) for some simply connected space X. A main motivation for this article is to answer the question which algebras are realizable as the equivariant cohomology HT (X; Q) for some compact torus T . Naturally these algebras come equipped with a map R  HT (X), where R := H(BT ; Q) is the cohomology of the classifying space. Hence the question should be asked for R-algebras. It is not hard to deduce from nonequivariant realization that any finite type R-algebra A is realizable as HT (X) for some free T -action on a simply connected space X provided A1 = 0 and R2  A0  A2 is injective (see e.g. [10, Proposition 4.2]). While at first glance this solves the problem, the answer is a little unsatisfactory: one can check that outside of the case where dimQ HT (X) is finite ­which it is usually not­ such a free realization X has to be infinite dimensional. In fact, finding nice realizations has to be much harder, as for sufficiently nice spaces, there is powerful machinery linking algebraic properties of HT (X) to geometric properties of the action. One of the most prominent theorem in this direction is the Borel localization theorem which requires the T -space to be compact or satisfy certain other finiteness conditions (cf. [1, Section 3.2]). Consequently the interesting question to ask is: when is an R-algebra realized as the equivariant cohomology of a compact T -space or even a finite T -CW-complex? This turns out to be a more sophisticated problem as is illustrated e.g. by the fact that for T = S1, R = Q[x], c  Q, the graded Q[x]-algebra Q[x, a]/(a2 - cx2) is realizable by a finite S1-CW-complex if and only if c is a square (see Example 6.3). Hence the above realizability question relies heavily on the multiplicative structure, to the point that the outcome might change when passing to R-coefficients.

In the nonequivariant case, the realization question for cohomology algebras was solved by giving an algebraic description of the category of simply connected, finite Q-type spaces up to rational equivalence. In the same vein, to attack this question we first give an algebraic description of the category of T -simply connected, T -finite Q-type T -spaces up to equivariant rational equivalence. Here a T -space X is called T -simply connected (resp. T -finite Q-type) if every path component of XH is simply connected (resp. if dim Hk(XH; Q) <  for k  0) for all H  T . An equivariant rational equivalence is an equivariant map X  Y such that H(XH; Q)  H(Y H; Q) is an isomorphism for all H  T . Mostly for technical reasons, we restrict to spaces with finitely many orbit types (see Remark 2.8).
Of course, this algebraization of the equivariant rational homotopy category is of interest independently of the cohomology realization problem. In fact, an algebraic description of this category has already been achieved in [14] using the following approach (in slightly greater generality): define S to be the set of pairs (U, H) of subgroups of T , with U  H and U connected. Then consider the functor which maps a T -space X to the diagram of cochain algebras, with entries AP L(XTH/U ) for any (U, H)  S, where AP L denotes the polynomial de Rham algebra and XTH/U is the Borel construction of the T /U-action on the H-fixed points. Formally this diagram is itself a functor S  cdga0 with values in the category of commutative cochain algebras, when regarding S as a category in a suitable fashion. We call this an S-system. Denoting the S-system of a T -space X by AP L(X), we obtain a map AP L()  AP L(X) induced by the constant map. At the (U, H) position of AP L() we have AP L(B(T /U)). Thus pointwise, this captures the algebraic data of the respective Borel fibrations. Choosing a nice model P  AP L() we obtain a functor from T -spaces to systems of cochain algebras under P , i.e. morphisms of systems P  A. Through this functor, the authors of [14] achieve an algebraic description of the T -equivariant rational homotopy category. However, as is stated in [14], the object P is hard to describe explicitly. The reason for this is that P  AP L() has to respect the strict commutativity of the diagrams. Thus one can not freely choose Sullivan models for B(T /U) pointwise, which would in general just produce homotopy commutative systems.
In this paper we seek to overcome this problem by showing that the datum of the P -algebra structure is only relevant on the cohomological level and, in particular, the specific choice of P is irrelevant. This enables applications and lets us choose simpler algebraic models, which ­ in the right setting ­ can be written down explicitly. More precisely, we use the functor X  AP L(X) as above but at each entry (U, H) of the diagram we only consider the additional datum H(B(T /U ))  H(XTH/U ) on the cohomological level instead of the cochain level. We call this a cohomology R-structure, where R = H(AP L()) is the system of all cohomologies of the classifying spaces B(T /U). We prove (see Theorem 5.5)
Theorem. Let C be a finite collection of subgroups of T and D  S be the stable subset generated by C. Let A be a D-system with a cohomology R-structure. Then there is a T -simply connected, T -finite Q-type T -CW-complex X with isotropies contained in C such that AP L(X) is connected to A via quasi isomorphisms of systems respecting the cohomology R-structures if and only if A satisfies the triviality condition, is spacelike, of finite type, H1(A) = 0, and R2  H0(A)  H2(A) is injective. The space X can be chosen as a finite T -CW-complex if and only if A satisfies the localization condition and H(A(U, H)) is finitely generated as an RT/U -module for any (U, H)  D.
The localization condition in the second half of the theorem is just the necessary condition for realization by a sufficiently nice space, which is imposed by the Borel localization theorem. Thus this can be seen as a sort of "converse to Borel localization". This is the key to attacking the compact cohomology realization problem discussed in the beginning.

We point out that the first half of the above theorem can be obtained by drawing upon the results of [14] to obtain realizations for systems under P (as above) and, on the algebraic side, transition to cohomology R-structures by the means given in this article. The key ingredient in this realization is Elmendorf's work from [4]. The statements on the occurring isotropy groups and realization through finite CW-complexes then become separate problems of approximating T -spaces up to rational homotopy within the equivariant world. However, in the present article we give a different, rather self contained proof, which we believe to be of independent value. While behaving less nicely with respect to functoriality, our realization procedure allows us close control over the realizations. The idea is that the equivariant approximation procedure hinted at above can be applied outside of the equivariant world to approximate a space as the Borel construction of a T -space. Thus starting with a system of cochain algebras, we take (nonequivariant) geometric realizations through the standard realization functors. Then we transfer this realization to the equivariant world by approximating the spaces as homotopy quotients of a T -CW-complex via an induction over the isotropy groups.
With regards to the compact realization problem of equivariant cohomology algebras, we arrive at the following criterion (Theorem 6.1). We identify H(BT ) = Q[V ] for some vector space V generated in degree 2.
Theorem. Let A be a graded Q[V ]-algebra. Then A is isomorphic to the equivariant cohomology algebra of a T -simply connected finite T -CW-complex if and only if there is a finite collection V0, . . . , Vk  V of vector spaces, Q[Vi]-algebras Ai for i = 0, . . . , k, and for each inclusion Vi  Vj a map fij : Ai  Q[Vi] Q[Vj] Aj of Q[Vi]-algebras satisfying the following properties:
(i) V0 = V , Vk = 0, and for any i, j we have Vi + Vj = Vl for some 0  l  k.
(ii) A0 = A, each Ai is spacelike, finitely generated as Q[Vi]-module, A1i = 0, and ViA0  A2 is injective for 0  i  k.
(iii) We have (idQ[Vi] Q[Vj] fjl)  fij = fil. Furthermore for any subspace W  V and the maximal Vj  {V0, . . . , Vk} with the property that Vj  W , the map f0j becomes an isomorphism when localized at the multiplicative subset S(W )  Q[V ] generated by V \W .
We give two more specific applications. The first is a simplified classification of the equivariant cohomology algebras of finite S1-CW-complexes with discrete fixed points (Corollary 6.2). Note that this can also be used to show nonrealizability of certain algebras (see Example 6.3). We identify H(BS1) = Q[x].
Corollary. Let A be a Q[x]-algebra which is finitely generated as a Q[x]-module, spacelike, A1 = 0, and x QA0  A2 is injective. Assume further that for S = {xk | k  0}, the localized graded algebra S-1A has no nilpotent elements. Then A is isomorphic as a Q[x]-algebra to the equivariant cohomology of a finite S1-CW-complex if and only if (S-1A)0 = Q × . . . × Q as Q-algebras. In this case the realization can be chosen with discrete fixed point set and S1-simply connected. Conversely any equivariant cohomology algebra of such a space is of the above type.
As a second application we show (Theorem 6.6, Remark 6.7) that the cohomology of an abstract GKM graph in the sense of [9] is always realizable by a finite T -CW-complex whose one-skeleton is given by the graph. In fact, as we do not use those parts of the definition of an abstract GKM graph which model the combinatorial behaviour of T -manifolds, we work in a simplified setting, which we call T -graphs.
Theorem. Let (, ) be a T -graph. Then there is a finite T -CW-complex X with HT (X) = H() and whose one-skeleton X1 = {x  X | codimTx  1} is the graph of two-spheres defined by (, ) if and only if for any codimension 1 subtorus H  T , the graph H is a disjoint union of trees. In this case X can be chosen to be T -simply connected. In particular, any abstract GKM graph is realizable by a T -simply connected finite T -CW-complex.

Besides realization problems, there remains the question how much our algebraic models know about the T -spaces. It turns out that they contain all information needed to reconstruct the T -space up to equivariant rational equivalence. We obtain (cf. Corollary 7.5)
Theorem. Let C be a finite collection of subgroups and D  S be the subset generated by D. The functor X  AP L(X) embeds the homotopy category of T -simply connected, T -finite Qtype T -spaces with isotropies in C as a full subcategory of the homotopy category of D-diagrams of cdgas with cohomology R-structures.
For the proof we draw upon the corresponding statement for the algebraic models in [14]. The above theorem then comes down to showing that no information is lost when restricting to finite diagrams and keeping track of the Borel fibrations only on the cohomological level as opposed to the cochain level.
The article is structured as follows: Section 2 is an introduction to the main machinery and key definitions. As an example we discuss an explicit algebraic model describing a T 2-action on S6. Section 3 deals with nice choices of models for the systems of algebras introduced in Section 2. It is the most technical of the sections and mainly serves as a compendium for the rest of the paper. In Section 4 we study the relation between cohomology R-structures and morphisms P  A of (strictly commutative) systems whenever P is a nice model for the system AP L() of classifying spaces. We postpone the discussion on implications on the homotopy categories until the final Section 7 as this is not needed for the rest of the paper. The goal of Section 5 is to prove the realization results of algebraic systems by T -spaces. Section 6 is devoted to applications of the realization result. Finally, as already mentioned, Section 7 serves to reformulate the results of Sections 4 and 5 in the language of homotopy categories.
We expect the reader to be familiar with the basics of nonequivariant rational homotopy theory and Sullivan models. We recommend [5] as an exposition. Furthermore, general familiarity with the concepts of equivariant cohomology and equivariant cell complexes is assumed, for which we point the reader towards [1], [19]. Knowledge of model categories (see e.g. [12]) is assumed only in the last section. For any missing explanations of terminology, we refer to the above sources. Acknowledgements.

2 The stratified cochains of a T -space
Throughout the article, coefficients will be taken in the field Q (unless stated otherwise) and will be suppressed from the notation. This concerns cohomology as well as all occurring cdgas (commutative differential graded algebras). The latter are all assumed to be unital and nonnegatively graded. They will also be referred to as (commutative) cochain algebras. Diagrams of cochain algebras, i.e. cochain algebra valued functors, will be written with underlines to distinguish them from cochain algebras.
2.1 Basic definitions
For any topological group G let EG  BG denote the universal G-bundle. We fix the construction of universal bundles from [15]. It is functorial with respect to homomorphisms of groups. For a G-space X define XG to be the quotient (EG × X)/G with respect to the diagonal action. The projection XG  BG onto the first component will be referred to as the Borel fibration. The construction X  XG is functorial in the following sense: consider a group homomorphism
4

 : G  H with induced map ~ : EG  EH, an H-space Y , and a map f : X  Y satisfying

f (g · x) = (g) · f (x) for any g  G, x  X. Then ~ × f descends to a map XG  YH. Note that the Borel fibration is induced by the constant map X   of G-spaces (with  = idG).
Now let T be a compact torus. We denote by S the category consisting of all pairs of

subgroups (U, H) of T such that U is connected and U  H. We turn this into a partially

ordered set by writing (U, H)  (U, H) if and only if U  U and H  H. It will be

convenient to regard S as a category, in which there is a unique morphism (U, H)  (U, H)

whenever (U, H)  (U, H). For a fixed T -space X and (U, H)  (U, H)  S, the projection

T /U



T /U 

and

the

inclusion

XH



XH

induce

maps

XH T /U 



XTH/U .

Thus a T -space

induces a contravariant functor from S into the category Top of topological spaces. Clearly

equivariant maps between these T -spaces induce natural transformations between the induced

functors on S.

Remark 2.1. The idea of regarding a G-space as a functor can be traced back to Elmendorf [4]. The specific functor

{T -spaces} - {Functors: S  Top}

was introduced in [14, Section 4]. We point out that we only need to consider (U, H)  S with U connected, due to the fact that we work over Q.
Definition 2.2. Any subset D  S inherits the partial ordering and we regard it as a full subcategory of S. A D-system (of cochain algebras) is a covariant functor from D into the category of unital cochain algebras. A morphism of D-systems is a natural transformation between them. A quasi isomorphism is a morphism that is pointwise (i.e. for any fixed (U, H)  D) a quasi isomorphism.
Example 2.3. · The fundamental bridge between geometry and algebra is the functor

{T -spaces} - {S-systems}, X  AP L(X)
where AP L(X)(U, H) = AP L(XTH/U ). If it is clear from the context that we work in a setting of D-systems, we occasionally write AP L(X) for the restriction AP L(X)|D.
· We set R = H(AP L()). Thus R(U, H) = H(B(T /U )) =: RT/U . Any T -space X comes with a morphism R  H(AP L(X)) defined by the Borel fibration. A T -equivariant map X  Y induces a commutative diagram

H(AP L(Y ))

Remark 2.4. For U  H, the datum of the T -action on XH and the induced T /U-action on XH are essentially the same. On the algebraic side this is reflected by the fact that, using the RT - and RT/U -module structures, one can reconstruct algebras AP L(XTH/U ) and AP L(XTH) from each other up to quasi isomorphism. Thus the system AP L(X) is more or less determined by its entries in the ({1}, H)-positions. However, the value of considering diagrams with varying first
component (instead of just fixing T as the acting group) becomes apparent when formulating
necessary conditions for systems to be realizable up to quasi isomorphism as AP L(X). As an
example, AP L(XTT ) is up to quasi isomorphism of the form RT AP L(X{T1}) which is a nontrivial restriction (see the discussion on the triviality condition below).

Definition 2.5. We call a subset D  S stable if it is of the form {(U, H)  DL × DR | U  H} where
· DR is a collection of subgroups of T which is stable under intersection and contains {1}, T .
· DL is a collection of subtori of T which is stable under intersection and for any H  DR the identity component H0 is contained in DL.
Example 2.6. A collection C of subgroups of T generates a stable subset D(C) as follows: let DR be the set containing all finite intersections of groups from C  {{1}, T } and let DL be the set containing all identity components of groups from DR.
Definition 2.7. We call a subset D  S bounded if the length of strictly ascending chains within the partially ordered set D is bounded. We say a collection C of subgroups of T is bounded if D(C) is bounded.
Remark 2.8. The subset given by all pairs of subtori is an example of a stable bounded subset. The definition essentially excludes certain scenarios where there occur groups with arbitrarily many connected components. For us it is important because it enables the inductive approach which is prevalent throughout the article. When approaching the main results we will occasionally restrict further and only consider finite systems. We do this since it conveniently simplifies some arguments as well as the notion of homotopy and aligns with the general spirit of the article. Generalizations beyond the finite case are oftentimes possible.
For a stable subset D  S and a subgroup H  T we set mD(H)  DR to be the intersection over all subgroups in DR which contain H. Note that for (U, H)  D we have (U, mD(H))  D. Now assume additionally that DL consists of all subtori. Then for any (U, H)  S the element (U, mD(H)) lies in D. This defines a functor S  D. We denote by
rD : {S-systems}  {D-systems} and iD : {D-systems}  {S-systems}
the restriction and induction functors defined by D  S and mD : S  D. We have rD  iD = id and a natural transformation D : id  iD  rD provided by (U, H)  (U, mD(H)).
Lemma 2.9. Let X be a T -space, C be the collection of all occurring isotropy groups of X and D  S a stable subset containing D(C). Then for any K  T we have XK = XmD(K). If additionally DL consists of all subtori of T , then (iD  rD)(AP L(X)) = AP L(X).
Proof. Define L as the intersection of all isotropy groups of X which contain K. We have K  mD(K)  L. Thus XK = XL implies XK = XmD(K).
Example 2.10. Consider T = T 2 and the T -space X = S6  C3  R with the action (s, t) · (v, w, z, h) = (sv, tw, st-1z, h). The occurring isotropy groups are
C = {T, S1 × 1, S1, 1 × S1, {1}}
, where S1 is the diagonal circle. In view of the above discussion (and the main results of the paper), the equivariant rational homotopy information on X is contained in the D(C)-system AP L(X)|D(C). We give an explicit description of a model M  AP L(X)|D(C). As a diagram of algebras M is given by

where the groups at the top and right indicate which entry of the diagram the respective algebra belongs to (e.g. (x1, x2, x3, v)2 = M({1}, T ), where the exponent in the first algebra denotes the Cartesian product). The degrees are |v| = 1, |xi| = 2 = |ai|, |b| = 6, |ti| = 3, and |s| = 11. The differentials are dv = x1 - x2 - x3, dxi = 0 = dai = db, dti = a2i - xiai, and ds = b2 - x1x2x3b. The horizontal maps are the obvious inclusions. For the vertical maps in the middle row we specify xi  (xi, xi), v  (v, v), ai  (0, xi), and ti  0. Finally the three arrows leaving M({1}, {1}) are defined by b  x2x3a1, x1x3a2, x1x2a3 and s  x22x23t1, x21x23t2, x21x22t3 respectively.
Let us briefly verify that this is in fact a model for AP L(X). We focus on the diagram aspects, leaving some pointwise verifications to the reader.
We begin in the bottom row. The space XT consists of two discrete points so Q2 is a model for AP L(XT ). Denote the groups S1 × 1, S1, and 1 × S1 by H1, H2, H3 respectively. Each quotient T /Hi is a circle and we choose minimal models (xi)  AP L(B(T /Hi)). Taking the two-fold product then gives the desired maps M(Hi, T )  AP L(XTT/Hi). If we scale the xi correctly, then their images [x1], [x2], [x3] in H(BT ) after composing with the respective maps H(B(T /Hi))  H(BT ) can be checked to satisfy [x1] = [x2] + [x3]. Thus we can choose an image of v in A1P L(BT ) that is compatible with the differentials and yields the Sullivan model (x1, x2, x3, v)  AP L(BT ) extending the previous maps. This finishes considerations for the bottom row.
In the middle row we have XHi = S2 for each of the Hi with the T /Hi-action corresponding to standard rotation. We leave it to the reader to verify the existence of the dashed quasi
isomorphism in a commutative diagram
(xi, ai, ti)    / AP L(XTH/iHi )


(xi) × (xi)


/ AP L(XTT/Hi )

where the image of xi is given by (xi)  AP L(B(T /Hi))  AP L(XTH/iHi) and all solid arrows are the previously described maps. We just note that strict commutativity of the square can be
achieved using the surjectivity of the right hand vertical map. To obtain compatible extensions to maps M({1}, Hi)  AP L(XTHi), we use the compositions (xi, ai, ti)  AP L(XTH/iHi) 

7

AP L(XTHi) and (x1, x2, x3, v)  AP L(BT )  AP L(XTHi), which in fact agree on xi and thus piece together to a quasi isomorphism.
Finally, we sketch how to construct the remaining map M({1}, {1})  AP L(XT ) such that it is compatible with all other maps. We write D({1}, {1}) the subset of D(C) consist-
ing of the ({1}, Hi) and ({1}, T ). We have given maps M({1}, {1})  limD({1},{1}) M  limD({1},{1}) AP L(X). By standard theory (cf. Lemma 3.14) there is a surjective quasi isomorphism AP L(YT )  limD({1},{1}) AP L(X), where YT is the union over all subcomplexes in the limit. Here Y  X is just the one-skeleton of the action, consisting of three copies of S2, joined
at the poles. We can now lift to a map M({1}, {1})  AP L(YT ) and we are done if we can lift this through the map AP L(XT )  AP L(YT ). On the xi and v this lift is just given by (x1, x2, x3, v)  AP L(BT )  AP L(XT ). On b, s this lift can be constructed by hand, using that AP L(XT )  AP L(YT ) is surjective and an isomorphism on cohomology in higher degrees.

2.2 Cohomology R-structures

In Example 2.10, at each point (U, H)  D(C) of the diagram, there is a map RT/U  M(U, H),

which (xi),

is a RT

model for the Borel = (x1, x2, x3)/(x1

fibration. To - x2 - x3) =

obtain an explicit description, e.g. identify RT/Hi = (x1, x2) and take the obvious inclusions (diagonal

in the bottom row). However for the whole system this does not piece together to a morphism

R  M. The reason is that w.r.t. these identifications the map RT/H3  RT is defined by x3  x1 - x2, while in M the equality x3 = x1 - x2 does not hold on the cochain level. This

causes problems with respect to strict commutativity. Note however that there are no problems

to define R  H(M) on the level of cohomology, leading us to the following

Definition 2.11. A cohomology R-structure on a D-system A is a morphism R|D  H(A).
Definition 2.12. Let A be a D-system with a cohomology R-structure. We say that A satisfies the triviality condition (TC) if the map

RT/K RT/U H(A(U, H))  H(A(K, H)) is an isomorphism for every (U, H), (K, H)  D with K  U.

Remark 2.13. This condition reflects the fact that the Borel fibration of a trivial action is just a product: let X be a T -space and U  T a subtorus which acts trivially. Then let L  T be a complementary torus to U, i.e. T = U × L and L = T /U. Then ET  EU × EL, XT  BU × XL, and RT = RU  RL = RU  RT/U . We obtain
HT (X) = H(BU )  HL (X) = RU  HT/U (X) = RT RT/U HT/U (X).
In particular the canonical cohomology R-structure of AP L(X) satisfies (TC).
Definition 2.14. For any (U, H)  S let ST/U (H)  RT/U be the multiplicative subset generated by RT2 /U \V , with V = ker(H2(B(T /U ))  H2(B(H/U ))). Let A be a D-system with a cohomology R-structure. We say that A satisfies the localization condition (LC) if for any (U, H)  D and any torus K  H, the localized map

ST/U (K)-1H(A(U, H))  ST/U (K)-1H(A((U, mD(K)))

is an isomorphism.

Remark 2.15. (i) Note that mS(H) = H for any H  T . Thus over Q, the Borel localization theorem can be rephrased as follows: for a suitably nice T -space X the S-system AP L(X) together with R  H(AP L(X)) satisfies (LC). For the precise meaning of suitably nice we refer to [1, Theorem 3.2.6]. We note however that it includes the case of a
finite T -CW-complex.

(ii) Let X be a finite T -CW-complex, C be the collection of its isotropy groups, and D  S be a stable subset which contains D(C). It follows Lemma 2.9 that the restricted system AP L(X)|D satisfies (LC).
The following lemma is a crucial ingredient for the connection between (LC) and compact realization of systems.
Lemma 2.16. Let f : M  N be a map between finitely generated graded RT/U -modules and assume that it induces an isomorphism when localized at ST/U (K) for any torus K U. Then the kernel and cokernel of f are finite dimensional over Q.
Proof. Let p  RT/U be a prime ideal with p  RT2 /U RT2 /U . Then there is a subtorus K U such that the kernel of H(B(T /U ))  H(B(K/U )) is equal to p  RT2 /U . Then ST/U (K)  RT/U \p. It follows from the assumptions that the kernel A of f vanishes when localized at p.
Now in case A = 0, let p  RT/U be a prime ideal which contains the annihilator ann(A). Note that A is finitely generated since M is and RT/U is Noetherian. It follows that Ap = 0. By what we have seen, above this implies p  RT2 /U = RT2 /U and thus p = RT+/U is the maximal homogeneous ideal. Hence the radical is given by ann(A) = RT+/U . As a vector space, A is generated over Q by elements myi where the m  RT+/H is a monomial and the yj are a finite RT/H -generating set of A. By what we have just seen, these expressions vanish when the degree of m passes a certain point. It follows that A is finite dimensional and the same argument works for the cokernel of f .
3 Models for systems of cochain algebras
The goal of this section is to lay the technical founadtion for the rest of the paper by studying nice representatives of the quasi isomorphism types of the systems introduced in the previous section. The reader may notice relations to the notions of fibration and cofibration in the sense of model categories. In fact, conditions related to the surjectivity condition from Section 3.2 appear in similar context in [17], [20] and have been interpreted in model categorial terms in [18] in the setting of finite group actions. We will however not delve into the details of this viewpoint in this paper. We just point out that the properties studied in this section do not correspond to the projective model structure which occurs briefly as a tool in Section 7: in the projective model structure every system is fibrant and being a system of Sullivan cdgas is not sufficient to be cofibrant.
3.1 The disconnected Sullivan condition
Definition 3.1. We say a cochain algebra A is
· connected if A0 = Q. It is cohomologically connected if H(A) is connected.
· simply connected if A1 = 0. It is cohomologically simply connected if H(A) is simply connected.
· spacelike if H0(A) = Q × . . . × Q as algebras.
A system of cochain algebras is said to be (cohomologically) connected, simply connected, or spacelike, if it satisfies the respective conditions pointwise, i.e. at any fixed position (U, H)  D.
We recall some terminology which we try to keep consistent with [5], [6].

· A morphism of the form (B, d)  (B  Z, d), b  b  1 with Z = Z0 will be called a free extension.

· We say that a free extension satisfies the nilpotence condition (also called Sullivan condition), if B is cohomologically connected and Z = r0 Z(r) is a union of graded subspaces with d : Z(0)  B and d : Z(r)  B  V (r - 1) for r  1. We also just call this a free nilpotent extension.

· A relative Sullivan algebra is a free nilpotent extension as above such that Z = Z1. If additionally d : 1  Z  (Q  B1)  Z then we call it a Sullivan extension (the latter
notion was introduced in [6] and is in practice not more restrictive than the first one cf. [5, Lemma 14.8]).

· A free nilpotent algebra (resp. a Sullivan algebra) is a free nilpotent (resp. Sullivan) extension of Q. An almost Sullivan algebra is a product (Z, d)  ((U  dU), d), where
(Z, d) is a Sullivan algebra and ((U  dU), d) is contractible, generated in degree 0.

· We say a morphism of D-systems (resp. a D-system) is a free (nilpotent)/Sullivan extension (resp. free (nilpotent)/(almost) Sullivan) if the respective condition is fulfilled pointwise.

Rather frequently we will deal with free nilpotent cdgas (Z, d) which have Z0 = 0 and are thus not quite Sullivan algebras (but usually almost Sullivan algebras). A reason for this is that oftentimes bigger models are needed in order to achieve strict commutativity of diagrams (an example being Proposition 3.4 below). In [6] there is the notion of a -cdga which allows generators in degree 0. Unfortunately it has a built in minimality condition which we usually neither have nor need and is thus also not our notion of choice. We want to point out that the theory for relative Sullivan cdgas in [5] and -extensions in [6] is developed rather analogously and many proofs carry over verbatim to the less restrictive case of free nilpotent extensions (usually the essential ingredient is the "lifting lemma", which holds equally in the general free nilpotent case). A summary of the technical statements we will need in this paper is given in Remark 3.7.
While many standard references focus mainly on cohomologically connected cochain algebras, the theory extends rather seamlessly to spacelike ones. The reason for this is the following Lemma (see e.g. [13, Theorem B, Principle 3.2] for proofs and a deeper treatment of disconnected rational homotopy theory) which shows that the category of spacelike cochain algebras is completely described in terms of products in the cohomologically connected category.

Lemma 3.2. Let A be a spacelike cochain algebra. There is a finite product decomposition A = i Ai with Ai cohomologically connected and which is unique up to permutation of the factors. If B = Bj is another spacelike cochain algebra with cohomologically connected Bj, then there is a bijection between homomorphisms  : A  B and matrices of homomorphisms ij : Ai  Bj such that for each j only a single ij is nonzero.
The product decomposition in the Lemma is also referred to as the decomposition into the path components of a spacelike cochain algebra.

Proof. Since Qr = H0(A, d) = ker d|A0 we obtain a unique collection of idempotent cocycles 11, . . . , 1r such that 1 = 11 + . . . + 1r. The factors in the product decomposition A = Ai are given by Ai = 1i · A. The remaining properties are easily verified.

Definition 3.3. A disconnected free extension of B is a morphism (B, d) 

k i=1

(B



Zi,

d)

where each B  B  Zi is a free extension. We say that it satisfies the nilpotence condition

(resp. is a disconnected Sullivan extension) if each of the B  B  Zi satisfies the nilpotence

condition (resp. is a Sullivan extension).

Proposition 3.4. Let P , A be D-systems of cochain algebras. Assume that P is cohomologically connected and A is spacelike. Then for any morphism P  A such that H1(P )  H1(A) is injective, there is a natural factorization P  M  A where the first map is a disconnected free nilpotent extension and the second map is a quasi isomorphism.
Proof. This is just a consequence of the functorial construction of free nilpotent extensions given e.g. in [3, Section 4.7]. We briefly recall the construction (in a slightly adapted version) in order to demonstrate that it has the claimed properties. Consider first a morphism (P, d)  (A, dA) between cohomologically connected cochain algebras such that H1(P )  H1(A) is injective. Then we set M0 = P  V0 where V0 = ker(dA)1. We set the differential of M0 to be trivial on V0 and define 0 : M0  A in the obvious way. Thus 0 is surjective on cohomology and an isomorphism on H0.
Now for k  1 and each pair (x, y)  Ak-1 × Mk0 with dy = 0 and dx = 0(y), introduce a generator v(x,y) in degree k - 1 with dv(x,y) = y and 1(v(x,y)) = x. We obtain a commutative diagram

M0

/ M0  V1

0

A

xrrrrrrrr1rrr

where V1 is defined as follows: in degrees  1, a basis of V is given by the v(x,y) for all possible

choices of pairs (x, y) as above, while in degree 0 we choose a collection (xi, yi) such that the yi descend to a basis of ker(0 : H1(M0)  H1(A)). We set M1 := M0  V1.
A cocycle in M10 is of the form a + v with v  V01, a  P 1. It follows from the injectivity of H1(P )  H1(A) that we may write yi = ai + vi such that the vi are linearly independent in V01. Denote by L0  V01 the span of the vi and by W0 a complement of L0 in V01. Let  be an automorphism of M1 which is the identity on P , W0, and V1 and is defined as vi  vi - ai on L0. Then d = -1d defines a differential on M1 and  is an isomorphism of cdgas with respect to the two differentials d and d. Now d maps V10 isomorphically onto L0 and we can write the inclusion P  (V10  L0)  M1 as a relative Sullivan algebra. This implies that still H0(M1, d) = Q.
Furthermore we observe that regarding representatives of ker(1 : H1(M1)  H1(A)) we are in the same situation as before: setting M0 = M0  V10, a d-cocycle in M11 is of the form a + v with v  V11, a  M0. Furthermore, if ai + vi are representatives of a basis of ker(H1(M1)  H1(A)), then the vi are linearly independent in V11. This is due to the fact that an element of the kernel which is represented in M0 is also represented in M0 and is hence exact in M1 by construction.
We iterate this procedure of costructing the extension M0  M1 and obtain a factorization
P  M = i0 Mi  A in which the first map is a free nilpotent extension and the second map is easily checked to be a quasi isomorphism.

Now this construction is functorial in the following sense: for a commutative diagram of

solid arrows

P

/ M  / A



f




P



/ M   / A 

with M, M constructed as above, there is a canonical choice for the dashed arrow M  M
such that the diagram commutes and this choice is compatible with compositions. This can be seen inductively: given a map  : Mi  Mi which is compatible with the factorizations, we extend it to Mi+1 by sending v(x,y)  Vik+1 to v(f(x),(y))  Vi+1 whenever k  1. For some v(x,y)  Vi0+1, the element v(f(x),(y)) is not necessarily in Vi+1. However, there is some v  M0i+1

11

with dv = (y). to the fact that

Furthermore any element with this H0(Mi) = Q. Setting (v(x,y)) =

property v+·

is of 1Mi

the form v + we find that

· the

1Mi due element

f ((v(x,y))) - ((v(x,y))) is a cocycle in A0. Thus there is a unique choice of  such that it

vanishes, which is the unique admissible choice of  such that the diagram above commutes.

This proves functoriality of the factorization.

Now given P  A where P is cohomologically connected and A is spacelike, we have a

canonical product decomposition into morphisms P  Ai between cohomologically connected

cochain algebras. We apply the above construction to each of these factors to obtain a fac-

torization P  M  A in which the first map is a disconnected free nilpotent extension and

the second map is a quasi isomorphism. Functoriality carries over to this case and yields the

proposition.

Remark 3.5. Applied to Q  AP L() we obtain a free nilpotent approximation of the system AP L() of classifying spaces. We observe for later use that we in fact have an almost Sullivan approximation (parts of the following discussion are rather analogous to the proof of [5, Theorem 14.7]): we apply the construction from the proof of Proposition 3.4 to Q  AP L(B(T /U)) for some subgroup U  T . This yields a quasi isomorphism (V, d)  AP L(B(T /U)). With notation as in the proof of Proposition 3.4, we may rewrite (V, d) = ((V 0L)W, d) where d maps V 0 = i Vi0 isomorphically onto L = i Li  V 1 and W = W 1 is a complement of V 0  L in V . Furthermore the inclusion ((V 0  L), d)  ((V 0  L)  W, d) is a relative
Sullivan algebra. It thus follows (cf. [5, Proposition 6.7]) that dividing by the ideal generated by (V 0  L) yields a surjective quasi isomorphism

(V, d)  (W, d).

By the lifting Lemma the morphism admits a section. Tensoring this section with the inclusion of (V 0  L) = (V 0  dV 0) gives the desired isomorphism
(W, d)  ((V 0  dV 0), d)  (V, d)

with (W, d) a Sullivan algebra. The following technical Lemma will prove helpful at several occasions.
Lemma 3.6. For U  H  T , consider a homotopy commutative diagram

P (H)

/ P (U)


AP L(BT /H)


/ AP L(BT /U )

where vertical maps are quasi isomorphisms and P (H), P (U) are free nilpotent. Let MH = (P (H)  V, d) be a free nilpotent extension and let MU = P (U ) P (H) MH = (P (U )  V, d) be the pushout. Then the map

H(P (U )) H(P (H)) H(MH )  H(MU )

is an isomorphism.

Proof. We choose a minimal model RT/H  AP L(BT /H) which induces the identity on cohomology. Let H : P (H)  RT/H be a quasi isomorphism which is, up to homotopy, compatible with the chosen models. It admits a section H. Define U analogously. We note that the

12

given map  : P (U)  P (H) is homotopic to  =   H  H. Now any homotopy between maps f, g : P (H)  P (U)  (t, dt) induces morphisms
P (U ) P (H) MH  (P (U )  (t, dt)) P (H) MH  P (U ) P (H) MH
where the outer tensor products are with respect to f and g. By [5, Theorem 6.10] these are quasi isomorphisms. Two more applications of the theorem yield that p : MH  RT/H P (H) MH =: MH as well as
U  p : P (U ) P (H) MH  RT/U RT/H MH
are quasi isomorphisms, where the first tensor product is taken with respect to  on the left and RT/H  RT/U is understood via U    H . Clearly H(RT/U RT/H MH ) = RT/U RT/H H(MH ).
Remark 3.7. Using Lemma 3.2, the theory surrounding free nilpotent cdgas carries over to the disconnected realm. We collect here a couple of facts which we will use throughout the paper. They follow immediately from the standard theory by considering individual components in the canonical product decompositions.
· Any morphism B  C, with B cohomologically connected and C spacelike, factors as B  B  Z  C, where the first map is a disconnected Sullivan extension and the second map is a quasi isomorphism (cf. [6, Theorem 3.1]).
· Let P be cohomologically connected. A morphism from a disconnected free nilpotent extension P  M lifts through a surjective quasi isomorphism of spacelike cochain algebras relative to an initial lift of P . In case the quasi isomorphism is not surjective there is still a lift up to homotopy relative to P . Furthermore the homotopy class relative to P of the lift is unique (cf. [5, Lemma 14.4, Proposition 14.6]; note that results are formulated for the more restrictive relative Sullivan case, but the extra assumptions are not used; see also [6, Lemma 1.2]).
For a cochain algebra A the associated simplicial set, its so-called Sullivan realization, is denoted by A (cf. [5, p. 247]). The spatial realization of A will be denoted by |A|. Note that directly from the definitions and Lemma 3.2 we obtain Ai = Ai and | Ai| = |Ai|. Thus the basic facts on realization carry over by considering path components separately. We will use:
· Let M be a disconnected free nilpotent algebra. Then the canonical map AP L(|M|)  AP L( M ) is a surjective quasi isomorphism (this is stated e.g. in [5, p. 249] and [6, p. 28] for Sullivan algebras and -algebras respectively but the proofs apply equally in the more general setting).
· Let M be an almost Sullivan algebra. If H1(M) = 0 and M is of finite type, then |M| is componentwise simply connected. Furthermore the canonical map M  AP L(|M|) is a quasi isomorphism (the realization of an almost Sullivan cdga, i.e. a tensor product of a contractible cdga and a Sullivan cdga, splits into the product of the realization of the latter and a contractible space, as shown in [5, Section 17 (c) Examples 1,2]; then use [5, Theorem 17.10]).
· If P  M is a disconnected Sullivan extension, then the map |M|  |P | is a fibration (cf.[5, Proposition 17.9]).
13

3.2 The surjectivity condition
Definition 3.8. Let D  S be a subset.

· For some (U, H)  D let D(U, H) denote the subset of all (U, H) > (U, H). Also denote by D+(U, H)  D(U, H) the subset of those (U , H) > (U, H) with U  U and by D-(U, H) the subset of all (U , H) > (U, H) with H H.

· We say a D-system A satisfies the surjectivity condition (SC) if for any (U, H)  D the map A(U, H)  limD(U,H) A is surjective.
· For a D-system A and (U, H)  D, we denote by KA(U, H) the kernel of A(U, H)  limD(U,H) A. We say a morphism A  B satisfies the surjectivity condition for morphisms (SCM) if A and B satisfy (SC) and the maps KA(U, H)  KB(U, H) are all surjective.

Proposition 3.9. Let D  S be bounded.

(i) Let A be a D-system. Then there is a free extension A  B which is pointwise given by taking the tensor product with a contractible free cdga, and which satisfies the following properties: B satisfies (SC). Furthermore, if f : A  C is a morphism of D-systems and C satisfies (SC), then f extends to a morphism B  C.

(ii) A given morphism A  C between two systems satisfying (SC) factors as A  B  C such that the first map is as in (i) and the second map satisfies (SCM).

Proof. In (i), consider the filtration D = n Dn where Dn consists of all those elements (U, H) such that any maximal chain (e, T ) > . . . > (U, H) is of length  n. We note that the filtration
is exhaustive because D is bounded and that for (U, H)  Dn we have D(U, H)  Dn-1. Assume for some n that we have constructed free nilpotent extensions A|Dn  Bn of Dnsystems, such that Bn satisfies (SC). Now for every (U, H)  Dn+1\Dn we define Bn+1(U, H) = A(U, H)  (V  dV ) where (V  dV ) is a contractible free cdga which maps surjectively onto
limD(U,H) Bn. By construction, the map

Bn+1(U, H)  lim Bn+1 = lim Bn

D(U,H )

D(U,H )

is surjective for (U, H)  Dn+1. Iterating this procedure inductively yields the desired extension A  B in the limit. Now assume f : A  C is a morphisms and an extension of f to
Bn  C has been constructed. Then for (U, H) and (V  dV ) as above we extend f to Bn+1(U, H) = Bn(U, H)  (V  dV ) by choosing any lift of the morphism

(V  dV )  lim Bn  lim C

D(U,H )

D(U,H )

through the surjection C(U, H)  limD(U,H) C. This extends f to Bn+1 as a morphism of diagrams.
For the proof of (ii), at the (U, H)-position choose a contractible free cdga (W  dW ) which maps surjectively onto KC(U, H). Then set A(U, H) = A(U, H)  (W  dW ) and map (W  dW ) to 0 in A(U , H) for any (U , H) > (U, H). The obvious extension A  C has the desired properties except A does not necessarily satisfy (SC). Now apply (i).

Lemma 3.10. Let D  S and let F  S a subset with the property that every element of F is maximal in D  F . Let A be a D  F -system satisfying (SC). Then the projection limDF A  limD A is surjective.

14

Proof. Let x  limD A. For any (U, H)  F let x(U,H) denote the image of x in limD(U,H) A. Note that D(U, H) = (D  F )(U, H) and let y(U,H)  A(U, H) be a preimage of x(U,H). Then a preimage of x is given by the element y  limDF A which is y(U,H) in the (U, H)-component for (U, H)  F and agrees with x on the other components.

Proposition 3.11. Let D  S be a bounded subset and let A  B be a quasi isomorphism of D-systems which satisfy (SC). Then limD A  limD B is a quasi isomorphism. If moreover A  B satisfies (SCM) then limD A  limD B is surjective.
Proof. As D is bounded, any chain in D is of length  n for some n  0. Assume inductively that we have shown the proposition for diagrams whose maximal chain length is bounded by n - 1.
Let Dn-1  D be the subset of those (U, H)  D such that any chain (U, H) < . . . in D is of length  n - 1. By the induction hypothesis, limDn-1 A  limDn-1 B is a quasi isomorphism. Observe that the requirements of Lemma 3.10 are fulfilled when writing D = Dn-1  F as a disjoint union. By the lemma we obtain a diagram of complexes

0

in which the rows are exact. Note that for (U, H)  F we have D(U, H)  Dn-1. Thus the left hand map between the kernels is given by

KA =

KA(U, H) 

KB(U, H) = KB

(U,H )F

(U,H )F

with KA(U, H) and KB(U, H) as defined above. We claim that KA(U, H)  KB(U, H) induces an isomorphism in cohomology for any (U, H)  D. If this holds, then the same is true for
KA  KB and thus also the middle vertical morphism in the diagram above, which finishes the induction. To prove the claim consider the diagram

0

/ KA(U, H)

/ A(U, H)

/ limD(U,H) A

0

/ B(U, H)

with exact rows. The central vertical map is a quasi isomorphism by hypothesis and the
right hand vertical map is a quasi isomorphism by the induction hypothesis. Thus the claim
and the first part of the proposition follow. If KA(U, H)  KB(U, H) is surjective for all (U, H)  D, then in the induction above KA  KB is surjective. Assuming inductively that limDn-1 A  limDn-1 B is surjective, then the first diagram above implies surjectivity of limDn A  limDn B

Proposition 3.12. Let D  S be a bounded subset. Consider a commutative diagram of solid

in which the left hand vertical map is a disconnected free nilpotent extension and the right hand vertical map is a quasi isomorphism between spacelike systems satisfying (SCM). Then the dashed arrow exists such that the diagram commutes.

15

Proof. Let D = n Dn as in the proof of Proposition 3.11. Assume that we have constructed the lift when restricting to Dn-1-systems. Let (U, H)  Dn\Dn-1. Consider the pullback square

Q

/ limD(U,H) A


B(U, H)


/ limD(U,H) B

with the compatible P (U, H)-actions. By Proposition 3.11 the right hand vertical map is a surjective quasi isomorphism so the same holds for Q  B(U, H). In particular it follows that A(U, H)  Q is a quasi isomorphism. It follows from the (SCM) condition that A(U, H)  Q is also surjective. Note that D(U, H)  Dn-1. Thus by induction we have a map M(U, H)  Q, compatible with the P (U, H)-actions. We lift this relative to P (U, H) to a map M(U, H)  A(U, H). This defines the desired lift on Dn and finishes the proof.
Proposition 3.13. Let D  S be a stable bounded subset and A be a D-system satisfying (SC). Let (U, H)  D.

(i) The projections and are surjective.

lim A - lim A

D(U,H )

D+ (U,H )

lim A - lim A

D(U,H )

D- (U,H )

(ii) If H0(A(U , H))  H0(A({1}, H)) is an isomorphism and H1(A(U , H)) = 0 for any (U, H)  (U , H)  D then H1(limD+(U,H) A) = 0.

(iii) If in addition to the conditions of (ii) the map H2(A(U, H))  H2(A({1}, H)) is injective for every U  U , then H2(limD+(U,H) A)  H2(A(e, H)) is injective.

Proof. We prove only the surjectivity of the first map in (i). The proof for the second map

is completely analogous with the roles of the two components swapped. We have D(U, H) =

D+(U, H)  F , where F = {(U, H)  D | H H}. We filter F = Fn where Fn consists of those (U, H) such that the length of any maximal chain (U, T ) > . . . > (U, H) in D is of

length  n. The map

lim A - lim A

D+ (U,H )Fn+1

D+ (U,H )Fn

is surjective by Lemma 3.10 and the surjectivity of limD(U,H) A - limD+(U,H) A follows induc-

tively.

Now suppose H0(A(U, H))  H0(A(U , H)) is an isomorphism and H1(A(U , H)) = 0 for

any U  U   DL. For any (K, L)  S, let D(K, L) = {(K, L)  D | K K}. We claim that the projection

lim A - lim A

D+ (U,H )

D(U,H )

is an isomorphism. Any element (K, L)  D+(U, H) has the predecessor (K, H)  D(U, H).
Thus the projection map is an injection. On the other hand every element of limD(U,H) A extends to one of limD+(U,H) A by setting the (K, L) component to be the image of the (K, H) component.

16

We show now that H1(limD(U,H) A) = 0. Define a filtration D(U, H) = n En where En consists of those (U, H) where the length of any maximal chain ({1}, H) > . . . > (U, H) in D is  n. We claim that limEn+1 A  limEn A is surjective. The composition

A(K, H)  lim A  lim A = lim A

D(K,H )

D+ (K,H )

D(K,H )

is surjective by (SC) and the first part of the proposition. Thus A|D(U,H) satisfies (SC) and the claim follows from Lemma 3.10.
The algebra limE0 A = A(e, H) is simply connected. Now assume inductively that limEn A is simply connected. Let B be the kernel fitting in the exact sequence

0 - B - lim A - lim A - 0

En+1

En

of complexes. By the long exact cohomology sequence and the induction hypothesis H1(B)  H1(limEn+1 A) is surjective. We observe that

B =

B(K,H )

(K,H )En+1 \En

as complexes, where

0 - B(K,H) - A(K, H) - lim A - 0 D(K,H )

is exact. It suffices to show that all the B(K,H) are cohomologically simply connected. As H1(A(K, H)) = 0 it suffices to show that H0(A(K, H))  H0(limD(K,H) A) is an isomorphism. To see this, recall that by hypothesis H0(A(U, H))  H0(A({1}, H)) is an isomorphism for all U  U  DL. Since all algebras are nonnegatively graded, degree 0 cohomology is just the kernel of the differentials. But then clearly the projection limD(K,H) A  A({1}, H) maps the degree 0 kernels of the differentials isomorphically to each other.
For the proof of (iii) we note that limE0 A = A({1}, H) and proceed by showing that the maps H2(limEn+1 A)  H2(limEn A) are injective for all n. For this it suffices that H2(B) = 0, which is equivalent to H2(B(K,H)) = 0 for all (K, H)  En+1\En. For any such (K, H), the map H2(A(K, H))  H2(limD(K,H) A) is injective because the composition with the projection onto H2(A({1}, H)) is. But then H2(B(K,H)) = 0 follows from the long exact sequence of 0 - B(K,H) - A(K, H) - limD(K,H) A - 0 using that H1(limD(K,H) A) = 0 by (ii).
Lemma 3.14. Let X be a T -CW-complex with isotropies contained in a bounded collection C of subgroups of T . Set D = D(C). For some H  C we define D-(H)  D to be the subset of elements of the form (H0, K) with K H. Also set Y to be the union over all XK for T  K H. Then AP L(X)|D-(H) satisfies (SC) and AP L(YT/H0)  limD-(H) AP L(X) is a surjective quasi isomorphism.

Proof. We begin with the surjectivity of AP L(YT/H0)  limD-(H) AP L(X). In what follows, Sing(-) denotes the simplicial set given by the singular simplices of a space. The map cor-

responds to the morphism AP L(Sing(YT/H0))  AP L(colim Sing(XTK/H0)) induced by the mor-

phism of simplicial sets colim Sing(XTK/H0))  Sing(YT/H0) and the colimit is formed over all

(H0, K)



D-(H ).

For

(H0, K),

(H0, K)



D-(H )

we

have

XTK/H0



XK T /H0

X K T /H0

for

some

(H0, K)  D-(H). From this we deduce that the colimit can be identified with the subset

of singular simplices which respect the cover YT/H0 = (H0,K)D-(H) XTK/H0. The inclusion of

simplicial sets induces a surjection on AP L(-) (see [5, Proposition 10.4]). The same argument

shows that AP L(X)|D-(H) satisfies (SC).

17

To show that AP L(YT/H0)  limD-(H) AP L(X) is a quasi isomorphism, we first replace the XTK/H0 by open neighbourhoods. For a fixed 0 <  < 1 and T -subcomplex A  X we define an equivariant open neighbourhood as follows: inductively assume we have constructed

a neighbourhood Un of An in Xn. Then for each (n + 1)-cell  : T /K × Dn+1  Xn which

is not in An+1 we radially thicken up -1(Un) by length  into the interior of T /K × Dn+1.

This construction gives neighbourhoods U(H0,K)  YT/H0 for every (H0, K)  D-(H) which

deformation retract onto XTK/H0. For any (H0, K)  (H0, K) we have U(H0,K)  U(H0,K) and we

have

U(H0,K)  U(H0,K)

=

U(H0 ,K  )

whenever

XTK/H0



XK T /H0

=

X K T /H0

.

Then

limD-(H) AP L(X)



lim(H0,K)D-(H) AP L(U(H0,K)) is a quasi isomorphism since this holds pointwise and both systems

satisfy (SC). As before, the right hand algebra can be understood as AP L(-) applied to the

subset of Sing(YT/H0) which respects the open cover given by the U(H0,K).

In order to show that AP L(YT/H0)  lim(H0,K)D-(H) AP L(U(H0,K)) is a quasi isomorphism,

by [5, Theorem 10.9], it suffices to prove that the inclusion of the corresponding simplicial sets

induces a quasi isomorphism on the standard singular cochain algebras. This is a standard

result which follows via barycentric subdivision.

4 Strictification

The goal of this section is to show that the notion of homotopy of systems reduces to pointwise considerations in the specific case of models for the Borel fibration on T -simply connected spaces.
By (t, dt) we denote the free contractible cdga on the generators t in degree 0 and dt in degree 1, where the differential sends t to dt. There are two evaluation morphisms i0 and i1 to Q given by t  0 and t  1 respectively and dt  0. Recall that a homotopy between two morphisms f, g : A  B, is a morphism H : A  B  (t, dt) with i0  H = f , i1  H = g, where we write ij for the map idB  ij by abuse of notation. For a system A of cdgas we form the system A  (t, dt) by taking the pointwise tensor product and extending maps via the identity on the right hand side. We obtain morphisms i0, i1 : A  (t, dt)  A of systems. We point out that if D  S is finite, then limD A  (t, dt) = limD A  (t, dt).
Definition 4.1. A homotopy between morphisms f, g : A  B of systems of cdgas is a morphism H : A  B  (t, dt) satisfying i0  H = f and i1  H = g.

The following standard lemma is the key to passing from homotopy commutative diagrams to strictly commutative ones.

Lemma 4.2. Let P be cohomologically connected and A, B be spacelike cochain algebras. Con-

in which P  M is a disconnected free nilpotent extension, the outer square as well as the
upper left triangle commute, and the lower right triangle commutes up to homotopy relative to P . If  is surjective, then we find a morphism  homotopic to  relative to P , such that  =   .

Proof. Let H : M  B  (t, dt) be a homotopy with i0  H = , i1  H =   . Denote by Q the pullback of B  (t, dt) -i1 B - A. Then we have a map (  id(t,dt)) × i1 : A  (t, dt)  Q. One checks that this is a surjective quasi isomorphism. Now consider the map H ×  : M  Q.
We lift this through (  id(t,dt)) × i1 relative to P , where we use the constant homotopy

18

P  A  (t, dt) as an initial lift. The result is a homotopy H~ : M  A  (t, dt) relative to P which satisfies i1  H~ = . On the other hand   i0  H~ = i0  (  id(t,dt))  H~ = i0  H = 
Lemma 4.3. Let T be a torus, P  AP L(BT ) a free nilpotent model and A any cochain algebra. Then two maps P  A are homotopic if and only if they induce the same map on cohomology.
Proof. Let f, g : P  A be two maps which induce the same map on cohomology. Choose a minimal model  : ((x1, . . . , xr), 0)  P with xi generators of degree 2. It suffices to show that f   and g   are homotopic since composition with  induces a bijection on homotopy classes. By assumption there are y1, . . . , yr  A1 such that f ((xi)) - g((xi)) = dyi. Then the desired homotopy is defined by H : R  A  (t, dt), xi  f ((xi)) + (g((xi)) - f ((xi)))t + yidt.
Proposition 4.4. Let P  AP L(BT ) be a free nilpotent model. Let

A and

be two commutative diagrams of spacelike cochain algebras in which  is surjective and H1(B) = 0. Suppose further that H : P  B  (t, dt) is a homotopy from f to g and that f~, g~ are homotopic as well. Then there is a homotopy H~ : P  A  (t, dt) from f~ to g~ such that H =   id(t,dt)  H~ .

Proof. Consider the commutative diagram

Q

which we claim to be homotopy commutative. If this is true then by Lemma 4.2, we can homotope G to a map H~ which makes the diagram strictly commutative and thus gives the
desired homotopy. Let x  P 2 be closed. Writing Q  (A × A) × (B  (t, dt)), we find that the difference
 -   G maps x to an element ((0, 0), y) where y  ker(B  (t, dt)  B × B). It follows that y = dz is exact. Let z  A1 × A1 be an element whose image in B × B agrees with that of z. It follows that dz  K = ker(A × A  B × B). The long exact cohomology sequence of K  A × A  B × B together with the fact that H1(B) = 0 implies that H2(K)  H2(A × A) is injective. Thus there is some a  K1 with da = dz. The element (z - a, z) lies in Q and
thus (x) -   G(x) is exact in Q. The claim now follows from Lemma 4.3.

Definition 4.5. A weak morphism f : A  B of D-systems is a morphism A(U, H)  B(U, H) for every (U, H)  D, such that the diagrams
A(U, H) / B(U, H)


A(K, L)


/ B(K, L)

commute up to homotopy. We also refer to such a morphism as a weak A-structure on B. If the diagrams commute strictly (i.e. f is a morphism of D-systems) we also refer to f as a strict morphism and say B has a (strict) A-structure.
Remark 4.6. There is a weak morphism R  AP L() which is a pointwise minimal Sullivan model. Thus if P  AP L() is a weak quasi isomorphism which is pointwise a free nilpotent model, then there are weak quasi isomorphisms P  R in both directions. This establishes a correspondence between weak P -structures and cohomology R-structures on A in the following fashion.
Clearly every weak morphism P  A induces a cohomology R-structure via H(P ) = R. Conversely, by Lemma 4.3, choosing cocycle representatives produces a weak morphism R  A from a cohomology R-structure on A. Composing with the weak morphism P  R gives a weak morphism P  A. These two constructions are inverse to one another up to pointwise homotopy on the side of weak P -structures. We extend the conditions (TC) and (LC) to (weak) P -structures in the obvious fashion.
Theorem 4.7. Let D be stable and finite. Let P be a free nilpotent D-system satisfying P (U, H) = P (U, T ) for all (U, H)  D and which admits a weak quasi isomorphism P  AP L(). Let A be a spacelike D-system satisfying H1(A) = 0, (SC), and (TC).
(i) For every weak morphism P  A, there is a pointwise homotopic strict morphism P  A.
(ii) For any two strict morphisms f, g : P  A which are pointwise homotopic to one another, there is a strict morphism H : P  A  (t, dt) which is a homotopy from f to g.
(iii) Let P  M be a disconnected free nilpotent extension and f, g : M  A be two morphisms whose restrictions to P agree. Then if f and g are homotopic, they are connected by a chain of homotopies relative to P .
Proof. Let f : P  A a weak morphism. We construct a strict morphism g : P  A which is pointwise homotopic to f . We filter D = n Dn where Dn consists of those (U, H)  D where U is of dimension  n.
Assume we have constructed g : P |Dn  A|Dn which is pointwise homotopic to f . Let U  DL of dimension n + 1 and recall that mD(U) is the intersection of all groups in DR which contain U. Thus (U, mD(U))  D and (U, mD(U))  (U, H) for any (U, H)  D. We have D+(U, mD(U ))  Dn and a diagram
A(U, mD(U )) P (U, mD(Uf)(U),mD(g~U))/limD5 +(U,m D(U)) A
which we claim commutes up to homotopy. By assumption the two maps are homotopic after composing with the map to A({1}, mD(U)). Note that (TC) assures that the requirements of Proposition 3.13 (i), (ii), and (iii) are all satisfied. Thus H2(limD+(U,mD(U)) A) 

20

H2(A({1}, mD(U))) is injective and it follows that   f and g~ induce the same map on co-

homology. By Lemma 4.3 this implies homotopy commutativity. Then by Lemma 4.2 we can

homotope f(U,mD(U)) to a map g(U,mD(U)) which makes the diagram strictly commutative. For any (U, H)  Dn+1 we define g(U,H) as the composition P (U, H) = P (U, mD(U ))  A(U, mD(U )) 

A(U, H). Doing this for all U completes the induction and the proof of (i).

The proof of (ii) proceeds via induction over the Dn as well. Suppose we have a strict morphism H : P |Dn  A  (t, dt)|Dn which is pointwise a homotopy between f and g. Let U  DL be a fixed (n + 1)-dimensional subtorus. Then H induces the second map in the

composition

U :

P (U, mD(U ))

 lim P D+(U,mD(U ))



lim A  (t, dt)
D+(U,mD(U ))

and defines a homotopy between the two maps P (U, mD(U ))  limD+(U,mD(U)) A induced by f and g. By Proposition 4.4 we find a homotopy HU : P (U, mD(U))  A(U, mD(U)) between the (U, mD(U ))-positions of f and g, such that (  id(t,dt))  HU = U , where  is the map A(U, mD(U ))  limD+(U,mD(U)) A. This induces homotopies P (U, H) = P (U, mD(U ))  A(U, mD(U))  (t, dt)  A(U, H)  (t, dt) for all (U, H)  D. Doing this for all U  DL of dimension n + 1 we can extend the homotopy H to a map P |Dn+1  A  (t, dt)|Dn+1 which finishes the induction.
Now for the proof of (iii), let G : M  A  (t, dt) be a homotopy from f to g. The first step
is to homotope G|P relative to the endpoints to a constant homotopy. Consider two models for the interval (s, ds) and (t, dt) together with the usual evaluation maps es=0, es=1 : (s, ds)  Q and et=0, et=1 : (t, dt)  Q. Consider the subalgebra

S  (t, dt) × (s, ds) × (t, dt) × (s, ds)

consisting of those (a, b, c, d) with et=1(a) = es=0(b), es=1(b) = et=1(c), et=0(c) = es=1(d), and es=0(d) = et=0(a). This a model for the boundary of the square, i.e. for S1, with the four factors corresponding to the line segments. For i = 0, 1, let qs=i (resp. qt=i) denote the map es=i  id : (s, ds)  (t, dt)  (t, dt) (resp. id  et=i : (s, ds)  (t, dt)  (s, ds)). The map qs=0 × qt=1 × qs=1 × qt=0 defines a surjection (s, ds)  (t, dt)  S which corresponds to the inclusion of the boundary into the square. The qs=i, qt=i factor through S. The induced maps A  S  A  (t, dt) and A  S  A  (s, ds) are denoted ps=i and pt=i.
There is a unique map F : P  A  S such that ps=0  F = G|P , ps=1  F is the constant homotopy in t, and pt=0  F as well as pt=1  F are constant homotopies in s. We want to lift F to a map P  A  (s, ds)  (t, dt). We do this inductively over the Dn as above. Assume we have constructed the lift on P |Dn. Again, let U  DL be a fixed subtorus of dimension n + 1. We consider the pullback square

where all solid arrows are induced by the given maps. Doing this for any choice of U then yields the desired extension to Dn+1 by choosing the maps P (U, H) = P (U, mD(U ))  A(U, mD(U ))

21

(s, ds)(t, dt)  A(U, H)(s, ds)(t, dt) for any (U, H)  Dn+1. This will finish the induction. As for the existence of the lift, it suffices to show that p4 is surjective on degree 2 cohomology. Then the existence of a lift up to homotopy follows from Lemma 4.3 and this can be made strictly
commutative by Lemma 4.2 since p4 is surjective. Note that A(U, mD(U )) and limD+(U,mD(U)) A are cohomologically simply connected by Proposition 3.13. As H(S) = H(S1), we deduce that p2 is an isomorphism on H2. Furthermore, since A(U, mD(U ))  limD+(U,mD(U)) A is an isomorphism on H0, it follows that p3 is an isomorphism on H1. Using that p3 is surjective, one deduces that p1 is injective on H2. But this implies that p4 gives an isomorphism on H2 since this holds for the composition p1  p4. This finishes the construction of the lift F : P  A  (s, ds)  (t, dt).
Now consider the commutative diagram of solid arrows

P F / A  (s, ds)  (t, dt)

ps=0

and note that ps=0 satisfies (SCM). It follows from Propostion 3.12 that the dashed extension of F exists. By construction pt=0  F , ps=1  F , and pt=1  F are homotopies relative to P which connect f to g.
Note that if A carries a cohomology R-structure (or a P -structure) and A  B is a morphism of systems, then B inherits such a structure from A. Theorem 4.7, Proposition 3.9, and Remark 4.6 combine to give the following
Corollary 4.8. Let D  S be a finite stable subset and P a free nilpotent D-system satisfying P (U, H) = P (U, T ) for all (U, H)  D together with a weak quasi isomorphism P  AP L(). Let A be a spacelike be D-system with H1(A) = 0 and a cohomology R-structure satisfying (TC). Then there is a quasi isomorphism A  A such that A satisfies (SC) and a strict P -structure on A which induces the homology R-structure coming from A. Furthermore this P -structure is unique up to homotopy of D-systems.

5 Realization
Before we get to the technical details of the realization process, let us give a brief overview of the main idea, which is in fact rather simple. Lemma 5.1 below shows that gluing a free equivariant k-cell to a T -space X, changes XT (up to homotopy) by gluing in a nonequivariant k-cell. Thus as long as we glue free T -cells we have close control over what is happening on the Borel construction. Using this, Proposition 5.2 shows that given a suitable cochain algebra M and a T -space X, we can modify X by gluing free T -cells until M becomes a model for XT . Of course in the end, we are not interested in only gluing free cells but rather want to apply the previous approximation process inductively to tori T /H, with H running through all isotropy groups. This is done in Theorem 5.4, which achieves our goal of realizing whole systems of algebras.
Lemma 5.1. Let X be a T -space and i : X  XT be the inclusion x  [e0, x] for some e0  ET . For a map Sn  X denote by ~ : Sn × T  X the equivariant extension. Furthermore consider Dn+1 = Dn+1 × {1}  Dn+1 × T  (Dn+1 × T )T as a subspace. Then the inclusion
XT i Dn+1 - XT ~T (Dn+1 × T )T = (X ~ Dn+1 × T )T
admits a deformation retraction.
22

Proof. The map (Dn+1 × T )T = (ET × Dn+1 × T )/T  ET × Dn+1 given by [x, v, t]  (xt, v) is a homeomorphism. Note that our choice of ET (see [15]) is a CW-complex. The inclusion of the subcomplex A := (ET ×Sn)({e0}×Dn+1)  ET ×Dn+1 is a homotopy equivalence since both spaces are contractible. Thus ET ×Dn+1 deformation retracts onto A (e.g. by [11, Lemma 4.6]). This gives the desired deformation retraction XT iDn+1 = XT ~T A - XT ~T (Dn+1×T )T , where ~T : (Sn × T )T  XT is the induced map on Borel constructions.
The next step is to approximate an algebraic model by gluing free T -cells to a T -space. The key to this is the following

Proposition 5.2. Let X be a finite type T -space and assume that either X =  or that

2(XT )  2(BT ) is surjective and 1(X) is finitely generated on every path component. Con-

in which P  M is a disconnected Sullivan extension of cohomologically simply connected, finite type, disconnected almost Sullivan algebras. Assume further that P  AP L(BT ) is a quasi isomorphism and H2(P )H0(M)  H2(M) is injective. Then there is a componentwise simply connected T -space Y , which arises from X by gluing free T -cells, such that  factorizes
as M  AP L(YT )  AP L(XT )

where the first map is a quasi isomorphism and commutes with the P -actions. If X is a
T -CW-complex, then Y can be chosen as a T -CW-complex. If the kernel and cokernel of  : H(M)  H(XT ) are finite dimensional, then one can choose Y such that it arises from X by gluing finitely many T -cells.

Before we get to the proof, let us give a brief overview on the approximation step and sort out some technicalities. For an in depth treatment of the nonequivariant realization process of cochain algebras we refer e.g. to [5, Chapter 17], [6, Section 1.6]. A collection of the needed results with more specific references was given in Remark 3.7. There are two pairs of functors

{cochain algebras}  {simplicial sets}  {topological spaces}.

The simplicial set of a cochain algebra A is denoted A . The space associated to a simplicial set L is the Milnor realization and denoted |L|. We also write |A| = | A | for the spatial
realization of a cochain algebra. The simplicial set associated to a space is the set Sing(X) of
its singular simplices. The cochain algebra of a simplicial set is denoted AP L(L). Recall that AP L(X) = AP L(Sing(X)) by definition.
The canonical map |Sing(X)|  X is always a weak equivalence. On the side of algebras, there is a similar phenomenon: the functors - and AP L(-) are adjoint to one another and there is the canonical morphism A  AP L( A ) which is adjoint to the identity on A . If A is a disconnected almost Sullivan algebra of finite type and H1(A) = 0, then this is a quasi isomorphism (cf. Remark 3.7). In this case, also the map AP L(|A|)  AP L( A ) induced by the inclusion A  Sing(|A|) is a surjective quasi isomorphism, such that A is in fact a model for its realization |A|.
Now in the situation of Proposition 5.2, the cdga morphisms M  AP L(XT ), P  AP L(BT ) are adjoint to morphisms M  Sing(XT ), P  Sing(BT ) and we obtain an induced commutative diagram

23

|M| o f |Sing(XT )| g / XT







|P | o |Sing(BT )| / BT

of spaces. The right hand horizontal maps are the canonical weak equivalences and the left hand
vertical map is a fibration (cf. Remark 3.7). We want f to become a weak equivalence. This can
be achieved as in standard CW-approximation by gluing (nonequivariant) cells to |Sing(XT )| and XT accordingly. To make this precise, we consider a section s of |Sing(Sk-1)|  Sk-1 induced by a triangulation of Sk-1. Now given some  : Sk-1  XT let  := s   : Sk-1  |Sing(XT )| the corresponding lift. We have  = g  . Then for some extension  : Dk  |M| of f   we obtain continuous maps

|M|  |Sing(XT )|  Dk  XT  Dk

where the right hand map is still a weak equivalence and the left hand map might be closer to
a weak equivalence than before, depending on the choice of , . This is essentially the same as
taking a homotopy inverse of g (in case XT is a simply connected CW-complex) and applying usual CW-approximation to the resulting composition |M|  XT . However doing things as above makes it easier to keep track of strict commutativity of diagrams.
Now the idea is to go through this nonequivariant approximation procedure for the Borel
constructions while gluing free T -cells to X. This is done as follows: fix a base point in ET and identify X  XT with the fiber at that point. Now with ,  as above, assume additionally that  takes image in X and  maps Dk to a single fibre of |M|  |P |. The assumption on  makes sense since in this case the image of  maps to a single point in |Sing(BT )|. Denote by Y the T -space obtained from X by attaching a free Dk × T -cell along the equivariant extension of . Recall from Lemma 5.1 that XT  Dk  YT is a deformation retract. Then the following technical Lemma tells us that the above approximation step may be carried out
while maintaining the setup of Proposition 5.2.

Lemma 5.3. With the setup above, there is a map M  AP L(YT ) fitting into the commutative

diagram

adjoint to id|L|. The vertical maps in the square are induced by the simplicial morphism Sing(Z)  A adjoint to . In the case of A = M, P we may lift A  AP L( A ) through the surjective quasi isomorphism AP L( A )  AP L(|A|). Doing this for P first and then lifting to AP L(|M|) relative to P , we obtain the commutative diagram

in which the compositions of the bottom rows are the given maps M  AP L(XT ) and P  AP L(BT ). All morphisms within and between the two central columns as well as within the right hand column are induced by respective continuous maps. Of those, only XT  Dk  BT and |Sing(XT )|  Dk  |Sing(X  Dk)| need further specification. The first map just extends XT  BT by mapping Dk to the basepoint. The second map is the obvious inclusion on |Sing(X)| and on Dk it is induced by a fixed choice of triangulation of Dk extending the previous choice of triangulation of Sk-1. Now commutativity of the diagram can be checked on
the level of continuous maps, using that the discs in the top row map to single points in the
spaces corresponding to the bottom row.
Every algebra in the above diagram comes with a compatible morphism from P and the
morphisms in the top row are quasi isomorphisms. Thus we can lift up to homotopy relative to P to obtain a morphism M  AP L(XT  Dk) and we can further lift this through AP L(XT  Dk)  AP L(YT ) up to homotopy relative to P . The map AP L(YT )  AP L(XT ) is surjective so the lemma follows from Lemma 4.2.
Proof of Proposition 5.2. We first treat the case when X = . Furthermore, we begin under the assumption that XT is path connected, simply connected and M is connected. These assumptions will be justified in the end in a fashion which is analogous to the following induction
step. Assume inductively that we have a T -space Y  X and a factorization M  AP L(YT ) 
AP L(XT ) of P -cdgas such that for some k  2 the map H(M)  H(YT ) is an isomorphism in degrees < k - 1 and injective in degree k - 1.
For a space Z set Z~ := |Sing(Z)|. Furthermore, whenever a choice of map  : Z  Z is clear from the context, we denote by H(Z, Z) (resp. (Z, Z)) the relative homology (resp. homotopy) groups of (M, Z), where M denotes the mapping cylinder of . This construction is clearly functorial with respect to commutative squares of continuous maps. Consider the

where F denotes the fiber of |M|  |P |. Dualizing the assumptions we obtain that on homology, f : H(Y~T )  H(|M|) is an isomorphism in degrees < k - 1 and surjective in degree k. In other words, Hi(|M|, Y~T ) = 0 for i < k. Choose some nontrivial x  Hk(|M|, Y~T ). We want to glue a free T -cell to Y and extend f such that x becomes trivial.
The rational Hurewicz theorem provides an isomorphism Hk(|M|, Y~T ) = k(|M|, Y~T )  Q. The first step is to show that x comes from an element in k(F, Y~ )  Q. We do this by showing surjectivity of the arrow marked as  in the diagram

after tensoring everything with Q. Note that for k = 2 the second to right column becomes zero
and we only need to use the left hand part of the diagram, where consequently all groups are
Abelian. The proof is a straight forward diagram chase using the following facts: rows are exact, all columns except the central one are known to be exact, k(|P|, B~T )  Q = 0, i is injective, and p is surjective. Surjectivity of p holds by assumption and k(|P|, B~T )  Q = 0 holds since B~T  |P | is a rational equivalence. Finally, injectivity of i is equivalent to surjectivity of k(|M|)  Q  k(|P |)  Q. This is only an issue for k = 2 where the injectivity of i is in fact not needed for the argument, as explained above.
We have shown that x  Hk(|M|, Y~T ) comes from an element y  k(F, Y~ )  Q. Possibly modifying x and y up to nonzero scalars, we choose a representative  : (Dk, Sk-1)  (Mf , Y~ ) for y, where f : Y~  F is the restriction of f . In doing this, we may assume that |Sk-1 is of the form  for some  : Sk-1  Y with notation as above Lemma 5.3. Now we glue an equivariant cell Dk × T to Y along the equivariant extension of , resulting in the T -space Y . Furthermore set  to be the composition Dk  Mf  F . It extends the map f   and defines an extension of f to Y~T  Dk. By Lemma 5.3 we have a factorization M  AP L(YT )  AP L(YT ) of P -cdgas such that on cohomology the first map is given by

H(M) = H(|M|) -f H(Y~T  Dk) = H(YT ).
We claim that the total dimension of the kernel and cokernel of this extended f  has been reduced by 1. Indeed, one checks that by construction, the map H(|M|, Y~T )  H(|M|, Y~T  Dk) is an isomorphism in all degrees except in degree k, where
Hk(|M|, Y~T  Dk) = Hk(|M|, Y~T )/ x Q.
By iterating this procedure we may assume Hk(|M|, Y~T ) = 0, which finishes the induction. To justify the initial assumption of path connectedness and simply connectedness, we pro-
ceed as in the induction with few modifications. Decompose M = i Mi into path components. For a component Mi which maps trivially to AP L(X), we choose a simply connected realization Yi and a quasi isomorphism Mi  AP L((Yi)T ) as in the X =  case described below. Then we replace X with X  Yi and extend M  AP L(X  Yi) = AP L(X) × AP L(Yi) accordingly. Thus we may assume H0(M)  H0(XT ) to be injective. Then we glue free 1-cells to X in order to obtain a T -space Y  X and M  AP L(YT ) which induces an isomorphism on H0. This is done as in the induction above by killing H1(|M|, Y~T ) (note that for k = 1, the surjectivity of  can be shown directly and tensoring with Q is neither needed nor sensical).

26

Having an isomorphism on H0, we may consider path components separately and thus assume M and X to be path connected. We continue to make spaces simply connected. This is done as before, the difference being that we do not start with an element in homology which needs to be killed but directly with a nontrivial element x  1(YT ). By assumption, the composition 2(XT )  2(YT )  2(BT ) is surjective. Hence the second map is surjective as well proving that 1(Y )  1(YT ) is an isomorphism. Thus we may choose a representative  : S1  Y . We claim that 1(F ) = 0 and hence the composition f   is nullhomotopic. To see this, we use the fact that that |M|  |P | induces an injection on H2, or dually a surjection in H2 with rational coefficients. But the spaces are simply connected and rational so 2(|M|)  2(|P |) is surjective and thus indeed 1(F ) = 0. It follows that f   extends to a map  : D2  F and we proceed as in the induction by gluing a free 2-cell along . Repeating this we can achieve that 1(YT ) = 1(Y ) = 0.
We now consider the case X =  and assume M to be cohomologically connected by considering path components separately. We essentially use the procedure for realizing algebraic models by free actions as described e.g. in [10, Proposition 4.2]. The need for a slightly different argument is due to the fact that the approximation in the X =  case relies on the surjectivity of 2(XT )  2(BT ) in order for the resulting space to be simply connected.
Start by taking a nonequivariant rational CW approximation Z  |M|, i.e. a rational equivalence where Z is a simply connected CW-complex. Note that ­ as in the more complicated, equivariant argument above ­ we may take Z to be a finite CW-complex if H(M) is finite dimensional. Let X1, . . . , Xr be cohomology classes in H(P ) = H(BT ; Q) which correspond to a basis of the integral cohomology H2(BT ; Z). Using that H2(P )  H2(|M|) is injective, we see that Z  |M| can be chosen in a way such that the images of the Xi in H2(Z, Q) come from integral cohomology classes which are part of a basis of H2(Z; Z). Now use these classes to define a map f : Z  K(Zr, 2) = BT and pull back the universal T -bundle T  ET  BT along f . The result is a principal T -bundle T  Y  Z. Using the Hurewicz theorem and dualizing we obtain that the map 2(Z)  2(BT ) is surjective. An argument using the naturality of the long exact homotopy sequence then shows that Y is simply connected. Note that the (finite) CW-structure on Z translates cellwise to a (finite) T -CW-structure on Y . It remains to show that P  M is a model for YT  BT . For this we refer to [7, Proposition, 7.17], [2, Proposition 2.7].
Finally note that if, by abuse of notation, Y now denotes result of the procedure above, then AP L(YT ) is the limit over the AP L(-) in the intermediate steps. Thus we obtain the desired factorization M  AP L(YT )  AP L(XT ). Clearly, if the kernel and cokernel of the initial map H(M)  H(XT ) are finite dimensional, then the process is finished after gluing finitely many cells.
Theorem 5.4. Let C be a bounded collection of subgroups of T and D  S be the stable subset generated by C. Let P  AP L() be an almost Sullivan model and let P  A be a D-system under P . Then there is a T -simply connected, T -finite Q-type T -CW-complex X with isotropies contained in C such that AP L(X) is connected to A via quasi isomorphisms of systems under P if and only if A satisfies (TC), is spacelike, of finite type, H1(A) = 0, and H2(P )  H0(A)  H2(A) is injective. If C is finite, then X can be chosen as a finite T -CW-complex if and only if A satisfies (LC) and H(A(U, H)) is finitely generated as an H(P (U, H))-module for any (U, H)  D.
Proof. For a T -simply connected, T -finite Q-type, T -space X, the system AP L(X) has the described algebraic properties (cf. Remark 2.13). Conversely, let A be such a system under P . Let Dn consist of all (U, H)  D such that the length of any maximal chain (H0, H) < . . . < (H0, T ) is  n. Suppose inductively that we have a T -space X such that each occurring isotropy group H satisfies (H0, H)  Dn, XH is componentwise simply connected for any (H0, H)  Dn,
27

and there is a chain of quasi isomorphisms
A|Dn  B1  . . .  Bk  AP L(X)|Dn
of systems under P |Dn. By Proposition 3.9 we may assume that A and the Bi satisfy (SC). Now fix (H0, H)  Dn+1\Dn. Define subsets C(H) := D-(H0, H) = Dn  D(H0, H),
C(H)+ := C(H)  {(H0, H)}, and C~(H) := D(H0, H)  {(H0, H)}. We construct a space Y (H) by gluing T /H-cells to XH, as well as a chain of quasi isomorphisms linking A|C~(H) to AP L(Y (H))|C~(H). Doing this for all choices of H and piecing together the chains of quasi isomorphisms will then complete the induction step.
We start by extending the Bi|C(H)-systems to C+(H)-systems. Consider the decomposition A(H0, H) = i A(H0, H)i into cohomologically connected cochain algebras. Set P (H0) = P (H0, H) and let (P (H0)  Vi, d)  A(H0, H) be a quasi isomorphism from a Sullivan extension, compatible with the P (H0)-actions. We may write P (H0) as a tensor product of RT/H and a contractible cdga and construct the extensions such that d(Vi)  RT/H  Vi. Then (P (H0)  Vi, d) is clearly an almost Sullivan algebra. Set M(H0, H) = i(P (H0)  Vi, d). The map limC(H) B1  limC(H) A is a quasi isomorphism by Proposition 3.11. Thus we may lift M(H0, H) through this quasi isomorphism up to homotopy relative to P (H0). This yields a strictly commutative diagram

A(H0, H) o

limC(H) A o

M(H0, H)

'

limC(H) A  (t, dt)

/ limC(H) A o

which is compatible with the canonical P (H0)-actions. Setting the (H0, H)-positions to be M(H0, H) we obtain extensions of A, A  (t, dt), and B1 to C+(H)-diagrams, as well as quasi
isomorphisms between these extensions. Using the fact that limC(H) Bi-1  limC(H) Bi are quasi-

isomorphisms as well, we may continue this procedure to form a chain of quasi isomorphisms

of extended C(H)+-diagrams which are the identity in the (H0, H)-position. We claim that limC(H) Bk  limC(H) AP L(X) is a quasi isomorphism as well. Let D-(H) 
C(H) denote the category given by all (H0, K)  D with H K. Then the projections

limC(H) Bk  limD-(H) Bk and limC(H) AP L(X)  limD-(H) AP L(X) are isomorphisms. By
Lemma 3.14, AP L(X)|D-(H) satisfies (SC). The system Bk|D-(H) satisfies (SC) as well since Bk(H0, K)  limD-(H0,K) Bk = lim(D-(H))(H0,K) Bk is surjective for any (H0, K)  C(H) by Proposition 3.13. Thus limD-(H) Bk  limD-(H) AP L(X) is a quasi isomorphism by Proposition

3.11.

With the claim proved, it follows that we obtain a chain of quasi isomorphisms of C+(H)systems linking A|C+(H) to AP L(X)+ where the latter is defined to be AP L(X) on C(H) and

M(H0, H) at (H0, H). Also by Lemma 3.14, the map AP L(XTH/H0)  limD-(H) AP L(X) is a surjective quasi isomorphism. Thus by relative lifting we obtain a map M(H0, H)  AP L(XTH/H0) which is compatible with the P (H0)-action.
Note that either XH =  or there is some H H for which XH is nonempty and com-

ponentwise simply connected. In the latter case, 2(XH)  2(XH)  2(BT ) is surjective

on each component, which also implies surjectivity of the second map in the composition. In

this case furthermore 1(XH) is finitely generated. We can now apply Proposition 5.2 to ob-

tain a simply connected T -CW-complex Y (H) which arises from X by gluing T /H-cells and a

factorization

in which the top horizontal map is a quasi isomorphism of P (H0)-cdgas. Thus A|C+(H) and AP L(Y (H))|C+(H) are linked by a chain of quasi isomorphisms compatible with the (P |C(H)+ )actions.
We extend this to a chain of quasi isomorphisms of C~(H)-systems. The extensions of the
starting and ending systems A and AP L(Y ) are predetermined. For the systems in between recall that the (H0, H) position is always M(H0, H). For those systems we set the (U, H)positions, U  H0, to be M(U, H) := P (U, H) P (H0) M(H0, H) = i(P (U, H)  Vi, d) with the obvious differentials and maps between them. Note that the quasi isomorphisms of systems extend naturally as well, providing us with the desired chain of C~(H)-system morphisms linking
A|C+(H) to AP L(Y (H)|C+(H). It remains to see that these are quasi isomorphisms. Since we have quasi isomorphisms at the (H0, H) positions, this follows from the fact that all systems satisfy (TC). This holds by assumption at the start and the end of the chain and follows from Lemma
3.6 for the intermediate systems.
Having done this for every choice of H we define Y = HDn+1\Dn Y (H). For H1, H2  Dn+1\Dn, the quasi isomorphisms chains between the A|C~(Hi) and AP L(Y )|C~(Hi) agree when restricted to C~(H1)  C~(H2). Thus they all piece together to form a quasi isomorphism chain from A|Dn+1 to AP L(Y )|Dn+1. This finishes the induction.
Finally, assume that C is finite, A satisfies (LC), and the modules R  H(A) are point-
wise finitely generated. We claim that in the construction above, the kernel and cokernel of H(M(H0, H))  H(XTH/H0) are finite dimensional and one can therefore choose Y (H) as in Proposition 5.2 such that it arises from XH by gluing a finite number of cells. To verify the
claim let U H be a torus. When localizing the commutative diagram

H

H (XTU/H0 )

at ST/H(U ), the diagonal map is an isomorphism by (LC) as H(XTU/H0) = H(A(H0, mD(U ))) (see Lemma 2.9). The vertical map is an isomorphism by the Borel Localization theorem (cf.
Remark 2.15). In particular the horizontal map becomes an isomorphism after localization. Furthermore [1, Proposition 3.10.1] implies that H(XTH/H0) is finitely generated as an RT/H0 module and the claim follows from Lemma 2.16. Conversely, if X is a finite T -CW-complex, then [1, Proposition 3.10.1] as well as Borel localization ensure that H(AP L(X)) is finitely
generated over R and satisfies (LC).

Combining Theorem 5.4 with Corollary 4.8 now yields

Theorem 5.5. Let C be a finite collection of subgroups of T and D  S be the stable subset
generated by C. Let A be a D-system with a cohomology R-structure. Then there is a T -simply connected, T -finite Q-type T -CW-complex X with isotropies contained in C such that AP L(X) is connected to A via quasi isomorphisms of systems respecting the cohomology R-structures if and only if A satisfies (TC), is spacelike, of finite type, H1(A) = 0, and R2  H0(A)  H2(A)
is injective. The space X can be chosen as a finite T -CW-complex if and only if A satisfies (LC) and H(A(U, H)) is finitely generated as an RT/U -module for any (U, H)  D.

6.1 Realization of equivariant cohomology algebras
We want to apply Theorem 5.5 to derive an algebraic criterion of when a given algebra is the equivariant cohomology algebra of a finite T -CW-complex. Recall that RT := H(BT ) = Q[V ] for some finite dimensional vector space V in degree 2. We aim to give a formulation which is devoid of the internal terminology of this article and which uses a simplified version of the localization condition.
Theorem 6.1. Let A be a graded Q[V ]-algebra. Then A is isomorphic to the equivariant cohomology algebra of a T -simply connected finite T -CW-complex if and only if there is a finite collection V0, . . . , Vk  V of vector spaces, Q[Vi]-algebras Ai for i = 0, . . . , k, and for each inclusion Vi  Vj a map fij : Ai  Q[Vi] Q[Vj] Aj of Q[Vi]-algebras satisfying the following properties:
(i) V0 = V , Vk = 0, and for any i, j we have Vi + Vj = Vl for some 0  l  k.
(ii) A0 = A, each Ai is spacelike, finitely generated as Q[Vi]-module, A1i = 0, and ViA0  A2 is injective for 0  i  k.
(iii) We have (idQ[Vi] Q[Vj] fjl)  fij = fil. Furthermore for any subspace W  V and the maximal Vj  {V0, . . . , Vk} with the property that Vj  W , the map f0j becomes an isomorphism when localized at the multiplicative subset S(W )  Q[V ] generated by V \W .
Proof. Let C be the collection of subgroups H0, . . . , Hk where Hi is the subtorus such that ker(H(BT )  H(BHi)) = Vi. Then RT = Q[V ] induces natural identifications RT/Hi = Q[Vi]. For later use we also note that ST (Hi) as in the definition of (LC) coincides with S(Vi) as defined in (iii) above. Furthermore if Vi + Vj = Vl, then Hi  Hj = Hl. Thus D(C) consists of all tuples (Hk, Hi) with Hk  Hi. Set A(Hk, Hi) = Q[Vk] Q[Vi] Ai together with the trivial differential. Thus the A(Hk, Hi) and the maps induced by the fij define a D(C)-system A with an R-structure. Clearly (TC) is fulfilled. If we can show that A satisfies LC, then the statement follows from Theorem 5.5.
Let (Hk, Hi)  D and K  Hi a torus. Then mD(C)(K) = Hj where Hj is the minimal group in C containing K. It corresponds to the maximal vector space Vj contained in W = ker((H(BT )  H(BK)). We need to show that

A(Hk, Hi) = Q[Vk] Q[Vi] Ai  Q[Vk] Q[Vj] Aj = A(Hk, Hj)

becomes an isomorphism after localizing at ST/Hk(K). We split Q[V ] = Q[Vk]  Q[Vk] for some decomposition V = Vk  Vk. By assumption, in the commutative diagram

f0j becomes an isomorphism when localised at ST (K) which is the set of all monomials generated in V \W . Also f0i is an isomorphism when localized at ST (Hi)  ST (K). Consequently the
vertical maps become isomorphisms when localized at ST (K). Let M denote the kernel of A(Hk, Hi)  A(Hk, Hj). Then we have shown that there is a monomial f  ST (K) which annihilates Q[Vk]  M . We can write f = i(xi + yi) with xi  Vk, yi  Vk. Let f  be the product over all xi for which yi = 0. It follows from the bigrading on Q[Vk]  M that it is also

30

annihilated by f . By assumption xi +yi  V \W for all i and in particular xi  Vk\W whenever yi = 0. Thus f   ST/Hk(K) and ST/Hk(K)-1M = 0. For the cokernel one argues analogously, thus proving that ST/Hk(K)-1A(Hk, Hi)  ST/Hk(K)-1A(Hk, Hj) is an isomorphism.

Corollary 6.2. Let A be a Q[x]-algebra which is finitely generated as a Q[x]-module, spacelike, A1 = 0, and x QA0  A2 is injective. Assume further that for S = {xk | k  0}, the localized graded algebra S-1A has no nilpotent elements. Then A is isomorphic as a Q[x]-algebra to the equivariant cohomology of a finite S1-CW-complex if and only if (S-1A)0 = Q × . . . × Q as Q-algebras. In this case the realization can be chosen with discrete fixed point set and S1-simply
connected. Conversely any equivariant cohomology algebra of such a space is of the above type.

Proof. For such an A we set A1 = (S-1A)0 = Q × . . . × Q and V1 = 0. Note that the map f01 : A  (S-1A)0 = Q[x]  A1 induces an isomorphism when localized at S. Then by Theorem 6.1 there is a finite S1-simply connected S1-CW-complex which realizes A. Clearly

the realization can be chosen with a finite number of fixed points.

Conversely assume X is a finite S1-CW-complex such elements. By Borel localization we have S-1HS1(X) =

Sth-a1Ht SS1-(1XHSS11)(X=)Qco[xn,txai-n1s]

no 

nilpotent H (X S1 ).

Thus the nonequivariant cohomology H(XS1) must not contain any nilpotent elements. This

means that it is isomorphic to Q × . . . × Q. Furthermore the equivariant cohomology of any

finite S1-simply connected S1-CW-complex with discrete fixed points fulfils these algebraic

requirements.

complex. In fact Ac can be checked to be isomorphic to the equivariant cohomology algebra

of the standard S1-action on S2. We observe that while e.g. A1, A2 behave differently with respect to finite realization, we have A1 Q R = A2 Q R as (R Q R)-algebras. Thus finite

realization relies on the choice of coefficient field.

6.2 Realization of graph cohomology
A GKM manifold is a smooth, compact, orientable manifold M with Hodd(M) = 0 together with a smooth action of a torus T with discrete fixed points, such that the one skeleton M1 = {x  M | dim(T · x)  1} is a finite union of copies of S2 (some sources also require the manifold to be almost complex). These manifolds are named after the authors of [8] and their main appeal comes from the fact that M1 can be encoded in a labelled graph, from which HT (M) can be computed via the purely combinatorial notion of graph cohomology. On the combinatorial side, a notion of an abstract GKM graph has been defined in [9]. The definition, which we will not review in detail, encompasses several necessary conditions for a labelled graph to be realizable by a GKM manifold. However, currently there is no general answer to the question whether a given abstract GKM graph is in fact realizable by a GKM manifold. The aim of this section is to solve the realization problem in absence of the manifold condition while appropriately relaxing the conditions on the combinatorial side.
For a graph  we denote by E() the set of edges and by V () the set of vertices. We consider edges to be nonoriented. Motivated by the notion of GKM graphs, we work with the following more general objects.

31

Definition 6.4. A T -graph is a finite graph  together with a labelling function  : E()  H2(BT ; Z)\{0}. Considering H(BT ; Z)  RT , we define the (rational) graph cohomology to be the RT -algebra defined as
H() = {x  RTV () | x(p) - x(q)  ((e)) for any e  E() connecting p, q  V ()}.
Any T -graph  defines a T -space as follows: take a copy of S2 for every edge e  E() and endow it with the following T -action: up to sign, there is a unique homomorphism e : T  S1 such that (e) generates the image of H2(BS1; Z)  H2(BT ; Z) and we pull back the standard rotation S1 S2 along e. Note that the equivariant homeomorphism type of the result does not depend on the sign choice. This action on S2 has two fixed points (the two poles) which we identify with the two vertices associated to the edge e. Now glue the copies of S2 together at the fixed points in the way prescribed by . The resulting space is denoted by R(). We note that for GKM manifold M, we have M1 = R() for a T -graph . It is unique up to the signs of the labels.

Lemma 6.5. Let  be a T -graph which is a tree. Then HT (R())  HT (R()T ) is injective.
Proof. Since  is a tree it follows that R() is (non-equivariantly) homotopy equivalent to a wedge of two-spheres. In particular cohomology is concentrated in even degrees. Thus the Serre spectral sequence of the Borel fibration collapses at the E2 page and consequently HT (R()) is a free RT -module. Since the kernel of HT (R())  HT (R()T ) is RT -torsion by Borel localization, it needs to vanish.

For a T -graph (, ) and a subgroup H  T , we denote by H the subgraph with the same
vertex set and whose edge set consists of those edges e  E() such that (e) lies in the kernel of H2(BT ; Z)  H2(BH; Z).

Theorem 6.6. Let (, ) be a T -graph. Then there is a finite T -CW-complex X with HT (X) = H() and whose one-skeleton X1 = {x  X | codimTx  1} is equivariantly homeomorphic to R() if and only if for any codimension 1 subtorus H  T , the graph H is a disjoint union of
trees. In this case X can be chosen to be T -simply connected.

Proof. For a given T -graph , let X be a finite T -CW-complex with X1 = R(). Assume that for some subtorus H  T the graph H is not a tree. Since XH = R(H ), it follows that

HT1 (X Borel

H) = 0. By (TC) we deduce localization (LC) implies that

that ST HTodd (X )

(H)-1HT (XH) does not vanish in = 0. Thus we can not have HT (X)

odd degrees. = H().

For the converse direction, let C consist of all isotropy groups of R() and set D := D(C) 

S. The D-system H(AP L(R())) satisfies (TC), (LC), and H(R()HT/U ) is finitely generated
as an RT/U -module for all (U, H)  D. But then clearly the same holds for the D-system A := Heven(AP L(R())) where we have set the odd-dimensional degrees equal to 0. A MayerVietoris argument shows that indeed H() = HTeven(R()). Thus at this point realizability of H() follows from Theorem 5.5. Following the realization procedure, one can check that the

realization can be chosen with X1 = R(). A slightly less direct but maybe faster way to see
this is the following. Let P  AP L() be as in Theorem 5.4 and consider the subset C  D of those (U, H)  D with H of codimension 1 or less. Furthermore let A  A be a quasi

isomorphism such that A satisfies (SC) and fix a strictification P  A of the cohomology

R-structure on A as in Corollary 4.8.

We claim that A|C is connected to AP L(R())|C by a chain of quasi isomorphisms of systems with P -structures. If this holds, then the inductive realization procedure in the proof of

Theorem 5.4 can be continued by gluing cells of isotropy codimension  2 to R(), extending

the quasi isomorphism of C-systems to one of D-systems. This yields the desired realization.

32

Let Y be any T -space such that AP L(Y ) is quasi isomorphic to A (as provided by Theorem 5.4). Via the quasi isomorphism, the vertices of R() correspond to the path components of

Y T and we choose an image of each vertex in the respective component. Any S2 in R() with

principal isotropy H can be seen as a 1-cell [0, 1] × T /H glued to the respective vertices. The

existence of the quasi isomorphism implies that two vertices lie in the same component of R()H

if and only if their images lie in the same path component of Y H. Thus we can extend the map

over the 1-cells to obtain an equivariant map R()  Y . This induces for each (U, H)  C a

commutative diagram

HT/U (R()H ) o

HT/U (Y H )


HT/U (R()T ) o


HT/U (Y T )

in which the bottom horizontal map is the identity when identifying HT/U (Y T ) = A(U, T ) = HTev/eUn(R()T ) via the given quasi isomorphisms. The images of the vertical maps agree since HT/U (R()T ) is concentrated in even degrees. By Lemma 6.5, the vertical maps are injective and thus the top horizontal map is an isomorphism. This proves the claim.

Remark 6.7. For a T -graph to be an abstract GKM graph in the sense of [9], it is in particular
required that two adjacent edges have linearly independent labels. In this case, the subgraphs H in the requirements of Theorem 6.6 are disjoint unions of single vertices and single edge
graphs. Thus the theorem is applicable and all abstract GKM graphs are realizable by finite
T -CW-complexes. Recall that in the definition of a GKM manifold M we require Hodd(M) = 0. With respect to
this condition our realizations behave as follows: under the assumption that the fixed point set of a T -space X is discrete, the condition Hodd(X) = 0 is equivalent to the fact that HT (X) is free as an RT -module (observe that the Serre spectral Sequence of the Borel fibration degenerates at E2 if and only if Hodd(X) = 0; then use [1, Corollary 4.2.3]). Consequently, any of our realizations from Theorem 6.6 will fulfil the condition of vanishing odd cohomology if and only
if the graph allows such a realization, i.e. if the graph cohomology is free over RT .

7 The equivariant rational homotopy category
An equivariant rational equivalence is an equivariant map X  Y between T -spaces such that the induced maps XH  Y H are rational equivalences for all H  T . The equivariant rational homotopy category is the localization of the category of T -spaces at the equivariant rational equivalences. The goal here is to find an algebraization of this category.
For some D  S, denote by AD the category of of D-systems D  cdga0. For some P in AD let ADP denote the category of D-systems under P , i.e. objects are morphisms P  A and morphisms are morphisms of D-systems which are compatible with the P -structures. The following algebraization was achieved in [14, Theorem 4.4].
Theorem 7.1. Let P  AP L() be a quasi isomorphism where P is free nilpotent. Then the functor X  AP L(X) induces an embedding of rational homotopy category of T -simply connected T -finite Q-type spaces as a full subcategory of the homotopy category of ASP .
We have adjusted the formulation slightly and restricted the result to tori and Q-coefficients to fit the presentation of this paper. We note that a description of the image of this embedding (similar to the corresponding parts of Theorem 5.4) is given in [14, Theorem 3.7]. This results in an algebraic description of the T -equivariant rational homotopy category. As the authors

of [14] state in their introduction, a drawback of the algebraization above lies in the fact that the object P is in general hard to describe explicitly. We opt to simplify the algebraization by showing that instead of a specific object P , we only need to keep track of cohomological data in the form of cohomology R-structures. Let ADR denote the category whose objects are D-systems D  cdga0 with cohomology R-structures and whose morphisms are morphisms of systems which respect the cohomology R-structures.
Remark 7.2. We wish to form the homotopy categories of Ho(ADP ) and Ho(ADR) by localizing with respect to quasi isomorphisms. To do this, we fix the following model structures. On the category of non-negatively graded, unital cdgas we choose the model structure introduced in [3], whose weak equivalences are quasi isomorphisms and whose fibrations are surjective maps. Then by [12, Theorem 11.6.1] we have an induced model structure on AD whose fibrations and weak equivalences are just defined as pointwise surjections and quasi isomorphisms. The undercategory ADP inherits this model structure by defining morphisms to be fibrations and weak equivalences if the forgetful morphisms in AD are ([12, Theorem 7.6.5]).
This guarantees the existence of Ho(ADP ). The category ADR is not an undercategory of AD. In fact, it is not technically a model category, e.g. due to the lack of an initial object. Still, the localization Ho(ADR) exists and can be explicitly constructed as follows: let C, F denote cofibrant and fibrant replacement functors on AD and let Q : ADR  AD denote the forgetful functor. Then the objects of Ho(ADR) are defined to be the same as those of ADR. Morphisms A  B are given by the homotopy classes in AD of those morphisms in hom(F CQ(A), F CQ(B)) which respect the cohomology R-structures inherited from A and B.
To see that this is indeed a localization at the quasi isomorphisms, we make the following observation: as CQ(A)  Q(A) inherits a cohomology R-structure from A, we obtain an endofunctor C~ on ADR with QC~ = CQ and a natural quasi isomorphism C~A  A in ADR. Analogously, F lifts to a functor F~. Now the claim can be proved analogously to [12, Theorem 8.3.5] while replacing the roles of C, F with C~, F~ in the appropriate places.
The following theorem is in essence a translation of Theorem 4.7. In the theorem below, parts (i), (ii), and (iii) of 4.7 correspond to essential surjectivity, fullness, and faithfulness respectively.
Theorem 7.3. Let D  S be a finite stable subset. Let P  AP L() be a weak quasi isomorphism where P (U, H) is a free nilpotent cdga and P (U, H) = P (U, H) for all U  H  H. Then the functor Ho(ADP )  Ho(ADR) induces an equivalence between the full subcategories on the spacelike and cohomologically simply connected objects satisfying (TC).
Proof. By Corollary 4.8, for any spacelike object A of ADR with H1(A) = 0 and (TC), we have a quasi isomorphism A  A such that A satisfies (SC) and a morphism P  A which induces the cohomology R-structure induced by A. In particular A is an object of ADP whose image in Ho(ADR) is isomorphic to that of A. Thus we have shown essential surjectivity.
We fix such a preimage for every object. If B is another such object of ADR and A  B is a morphism in homADR (A, B), then as in 3.9 we can extend to a map of systems A  B. This map is not necessarily compatible with the fixed chosen P -actions but it is so up to pointwise homotopy. Let B be the same as B but with the P -action induced by A  B. Then by part (ii) of Theorem 4.7 we obtain a homotopy P  B  (t, dt) such that in the commutative

all morphisms in the top row are compatible with the fixed P -actions. Also note that if we

already have a (strict) P -action on A or B then the P -actions on A and B can be chosen such

that the respective outer vertical map is compatible with the P -actions as well. Furthermore

the string of maps from A to B which goes through the top row and the outer vertical maps

defines a morphism in ho(ADR) which is equivalent to the original morphism A  B.

Now for A and B as above with a fixed P -action, any morphism in Ho(ADR) between them

is represented by a string of morphisms in ADR through objects which are spacelike, cohomologically simply connected and satisfy (TC) (cf. Remark 7.2). By what we have seen above,

this string is equivalent in Ho(ADR) to a string of morphisms which comes from ADP . This shows fullness.

It remains to show that the functor between the homotopy categories is faithful. It suffices

to show that this holds for the forgetful functor Ho(ADP )  Ho(AD). Consider two morphisms f, g : A  B between fibrant and cofibrant objects A, B of ADP
which map to the same morphism in Ho(AD). We need to show that they also get identified in

Ho(ADP ). Let M  A be a quasi isomorphism in ADP where M is a free disconnected extension of P  A (cf. Proposition 3.4). With the notation from above, Proposition 3.9 provides a

where the vertical maps are quasi isomorphisms. Analogously we obtain a map g^ and it suffices to prove that f^ and g^ are the same in Ho(ADP ). We show that there is a homotopy M  B  (t, dt) between f^ and g^. In this case by part (iii) of Theorem 4.7 there is also a homotopy
relative to P which finishes the proof. To prove this, consider cofibrant replacements CM  M and CB  B in AD. We
note that these are also fibrant since all objects are fibrant. Then f^, g^ lift to morphisms f~, g~: CM  CB which are homotopic in the sense of the model structure on AD. We may use
CB  (t, dt) as a path object. Again using Proposition 3.9 we obtain the commutative diagram

in which p satisfies (SCM). Applying 3.9 to CM  B  (t, dt), we extend the homotopy to yield the dashed arrow . The extension may be constructed such that it is compatible with the

is a surjection. Thus the whole diagram commutes. It follows from Proposition 3.12 that p admits a section s. The desired homotopy is given by   s.

Lemma 7.4. Let D  S be a stable subset and define D as the stable subset {(U, H)  S | H  DR}. With P as above, let B0 be the full subcategory of Ho(ASP ) on objects A which satisfy (TC) and for which iD rD(A)  A is a quasi isomorphism. Let B1 be the full subcategory of Ho(ADP ) on objects A which satisfy (TC). Then restriction defines an equivalence of categories B0  B1.
Proof. The functors iD and rD induce an equivalence of categories between B0 and the full subcategory B of Ho(APD) on systems satisfying (TC). We construct a functor j : B1  B which is inverse to the restriction rD : B  B1.
The procedure from Proposition 3.4, which replaces a system under P with a quasi isomorphic disconnected free nilpotent extension of P , is functorial. We denote the corresponding functor by D : ADP   ADP . As the functor operates pointwise, we obtain a compatible functor D on ADP satisfying rD  D = D  rD. For simplicity we just denote both funtors by . Let A be a D-system under P . For a subtorus U  T we denote by mLD(U) the intersection of all tori in DL which contain U. Now fix (U, H)  D. The algebra A(mLD(U), H) is of the form
i(P (mLD(U ), H)  Vi, d). We set

j(A)(U, H) = P (U, H) P (mLD(U),H) A(mLD(U ), H) = (P (U, H)  Vi, d).
i

For (U, H)  (U , H)  D we have (mLD(U ), H)  (mLD(U ), H) in D so j(A) naturally inherits the structure of a D-system under P . It satisfies (TC) by Lemma 3.6. We have rD  j =  and a natural transformation   idADP consisting of quasi isomorphisms.
If we start with a D-system B, then (mLD(U), H)  (U, H) induces a map
P (U, H) P (mLD(U),H) B(mLD(U ), H)  B(U, H).
We obtain natural transformations j  rD    idADP  . The second transformation is a quasi isomorphism and the first transformation is a quasi isomorphism due to (TC). This shows that j and rD descend to equivalences of categories between B and B1.
We sum up the results of this section in the following Corollary. We point out that in (ii), we only require P  AP L() to be a weak morphism. Thus we may choose e.g. P = R to obtain a description via systems with strict R-structures.

Corollary 7.5. Let C be a finite collection of subgroups and D = D(C). The full subcategory on
objects with isotropies in C of the equivariant rational homotopy category of T -simply connected, T -finite Q-type T -spaces is equivalent to

(i) the full subcategory of Ho(ADR) on objects A which satisfy (TC) and for which R2  H0(A)  H2(A) is injective, H1(A) = 0, and H(A) is finite type and spacelike.

(ii) the full subcategory of Ho(ADP ) (with P as in Theorem 7.3) on objects A which satisfy (TC) and for which H2(P )  H0(A)  H2(A) is injective, H1(A) = 0, and H(A) is finite type and spacelike.

Proof. Let P be a free nilpotent system with a quasi isomorphism P  AP L() such that P (U, H) = P (U, H) for all U  H  H. Also let the A0 be the full subcategory of Ho(ASP ) on those objects A which satisfy (TC) and for which H2(P )  H0(A)  H2(A) is injective, H1(A) = 0, and H(A) is finite type and spacelike. By Theorem 7.1, T  A0 is fully faithful, where T is the equivariant rational homotopy category T of T -simply connected finite Q-type T -spaces.
By Lemma 2.9, restricting to the full subcategory T C of T on spaces with isotropy groups in C, the image of the functor X  AP L(X) lies in the full subcategory AC0  A0 on those objects which also lie in B0 as defined in Lemma 7.4.
Let A1 be the full subcategory of Ho(ADP ) on those objects A which satisfy (TC) and for which H2(P )  H0(A)  H2(A) is injective, H1(A) = 0, and H(A) is of finite type and spacelike. Then rD : AC0  A1 is fully faithful by Lemma 7.4. It follows from Theorem 5.4 that the composition T C  AC0  A1 is essentially surjective. But as a composition of two fully faithful functors this means it is an equivalence of categories. Then clearly the equivalence between the two full subcategories of Ho(ADP ) and Ho(ADR) from Theorem 7.3 restricts to an equivalence between A1 and the desired category A2 described in (i). For some free nilpotent system P  with a weak quasi isomorphism P   AP L(), the equivalence of the category described in (ii) and A2 follows from Theorem 7.3 as well.
