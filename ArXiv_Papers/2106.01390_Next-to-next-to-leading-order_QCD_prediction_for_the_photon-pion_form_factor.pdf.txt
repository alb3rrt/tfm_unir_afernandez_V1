We accomplish the complete two-loop computation of the leading-twist contribution to the photonpion transition form factor    0 by applying the hard-collinear factorization theorem together with modern multi-loop techniques. The resulting predictions for the form factor indicate that the two-loop perturbative correction is numerically comparable to the one-loop effect in the same kinematic domain. We also demonstrate that our results will play a key role in disentangling various models of the twist-two pion distribution amplitude thanks to the envisaged precision at Belle II.

INTRODUCTION
It is widely accepted that the exclusive two-photon production of a light pseudoscalar meson 0 is of utmost importance for probing the partonic landscape of composite hadrons with unprecedented precision and for deepening our understanding of the factorization properties of hard exclusive QCD reactions in general. Historically, the pion-photon transition form factor (TFF) had been explored intensively (see, for instance [1­3]) even before the advent of QCD due to its apparent connection to the axial anomaly when taking the vanishing virtuality limits for the two photons. Likewise, for the energetic photoproduction at the light-like distance, the dynamical behavior of the TFF  ()  0 can be predicted by applying the operator-product-expansion (OPE) technique for the time-ordered product of two electromagnetic currents appearing in a variety of two-photon processes including deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) and deeply inelastic lepton-hadron scattering (DIS). In particular, the double-virtual photon-to-pion form factor has been demonstrated to be an indispensable ingredient for determining the hadronic light-by-light scattering (HLbL) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in the dispersive framework [4]. Moreover, the collinear QCD dynamics dictating the TFF at large momentum transfer is encapsulated in the universal lightcone distribution amplitude (DA), which is undoubtedly of decisive importance for the model-independent description of semileptonic and nonleptonic B-meson decays such as B   - ¯ , B   + -, B    etc.

These exclusive heavy-hadron decays have proven essential for unraveling the delicate quark-flavor mixing mechanism and for uncovering the ultimate mystery of CP violation.
Experimentally, the pion TFF    0 with one on-shell and one off-shell photon turns out to be more accessible from the "single-tagged" measurements of the differential e+ e-  e+ e- 0 cross section [5­7]. The unexpected scaling violation of the TFF reported by the BaBar measurements [6] triggered a storm of enthusiasm in the theory community with diverse speculations from both perturbative and non-perturbative QCD perspectives. The subsequent Belle data [7] covering the same kinematical region Q2  [4, 40] GeV2 (where Q2 stands for the virtuality of the off-shell photon), however, did not reveal the pronounced increase of the pion TFF in the high-Q2 region thus creating a moderate tension at the level of 2 in comparison with the BaBar results. The substantial improvement on the integrated luminosity and the trigger efficiency of the Belle II experiment at SuperKEKB [8] will evidently enable a clarification of the observed discrepancy between the BaBar and the Belle data and urgently demand the high-precision theory computation of the    0 TFF with rigorous QCD techniques.
At leading power (LP) in 2QCD/Q2 the exclusive photon-pion TFF can be expressed in terms of the perturbatively calculable coefficient function (CF) and the twist-two pion DA in accordance with the hard-collinear factorization theorem [9] (see [10­12] for an alternative formalism). The short-distance CF at the next-to-

2

leading order (NLO) in s had been determined from the diagrammatic factorization approach more than three decades ago [13­15]. The next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) computation of the perturbative matching coefficient was further carried out in the large-0 approximation [16] and in the so-called conformal scheme [17]. Consequently, the factorization-scale invariance of the resulting expression for the pion TFF was not achieved in the modified minimal subtraction (MS) scheme at two loops. Accomplishing the full NNLO QCD prediction to the TFF    0 is therefore of the top priority, on the one hand, for developing the perturbative factorization formalism of hard exclusive reactions particularly in the presence of an additional complication arising from the 5 ambiguity of dimensional regularization; and on the other hand, for elevating our capability to confront the yielding theory predictions with the forthcoming precision of Belle II measurements. In this Letter, we will take advantage of the soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) factorization program to obtain analytically the two-loop hard function by evaluating an appropriate bare QCD matrix element at O(s2) with the distinct multi-loop computational strategies and by implementing systematically the ultraviolet (UV) renormalization and the infrared (IR) subtractions, including the emergent evanescent operator, with an exploratory phenomenological analysis for the numerical significance of the predicted TFF.

THE PHOTON-PION FORM FACTOR

We first set up the theory framework for establish-
ing the hard-collinear factorization formula of the TFF F(Q2). The latter is defined in terms of the matrix element of the electromagnetic current

jµem =

gem eq q¯µ q

(1)

q

between an on-shell photon with momentum p and a pion with momentum p

(p)|jµem|(p ) = ge2m µqp  (p )F(Q2) , (2)
where q = p - p refers to the transfer momentum, (p ) is the polarization vector of the on-shell photon, and eq denotes the electric charge of the quark field in units of gem (the positron charge). Moreover, we have employed the convention 0123 = -1 and the notation Q2 = -q2. It is also customary to introduce two light-cone vectors nµ and n¯µ satisfying n2 = n¯2 = 0 and n·n¯ = 2, which permit the decomposition pµ = (n¯ ·p)/2 nµ and pµ = (n·p)/2 n¯µ.

We will dedicate the next section to the two-loop calculation of the bare matrix element (µ2) and subsequently
derive the master formula for the CF T2 in (3).

TWO-LOOP CALCULATION
The techniques entering the calculation of the bare two-loop amplitude have become standard in contemporary multi-loop computations. We first generate the Feynman diagrams both, with Feynarts [20] and by means of an in-house routine. Sample diagrams are shown in Fig. 1. After taking into account that certain diagrams have color factor zero (e.g. the third one in Fig. 1), vanish due to the Furry theorem and/or represent the flavor-singlet contributions (e.g. the last one in Fig. 1), a set of 42 diagrams (plus the ones with the two

3

photons exchanged) has to be computed. The entire calculation is carried out in dimensional regularization with d=4-2 .
The Dirac and tensor reductions are performed with inhouse routines, yielding two-loop scalar integrals, which get further processed with FIRE [21], an implementation of Laporta's algorithm [22, 23] relying on integrationby-parts identities [24, 25]. In addition, we exploit the fact that for the quark momenta p1  xp  x¯p  p2, which yields relations between integrals based on momentum conservation and enables us to arrive at the minimal set of master integrals. At this stage, additional Dirac structures besides µA,B disappear from the sum of all diagrams, making the QED Ward identity and charge symmetry manifest and providing a valuable check of our calculation.
In total, we get 12 independent master integrals, approximately half of which can be solved in closed form in terms of Gamma- and hypergeometric functions, which are then expanded with HypExp [26, 27]. The more complicated ones are evaluated with the method of differential equations [28­31], partially in a canonical basis [32]. Furthermore, Mellin-Barnes representations [33] are employed, both to compute boundary conditions for the differential equations as x  0 or x  1, and to derive the full x-dependence of analytic functions. Numerical checks of our analytic results are done with the sector decomposition program FIESTA [34, 35]. The analytic expansion of all master integrals can be written in terms of harmonic polylogarithms (HPLs) [36­38] with weightindices 0 and 1. To the order we are interested in, HPLs of at most weight four (i.e. at most four weight-indices) appear in the amplitude. We relegate the explicit analytic results of all master integrals to a forthcoming longer write-up.

ULTRAVIOLET RENORMALIZATION AND INFRARED SUBTRACTIONS

We are now prepared to extract the two-loop contribution to T2 by first introducing the operator basis {O1µ , O2µ , OEµ } with

(11)

where the renormalization constant of the strong coupling at one loop is given by Z = 1 - as0/ + O(a2s). Note that hereafter we disregard O1µ completely due to parity. The expansion of T2 was already given in Eq. (4), and due to scaleless integrals in dimensional regulariza-
tion the matrix elements of the light-cone operators are
simply expanded as

Sums over repeated indices are understood to run over {2, E}, Oaµ (0) is the tree-level matrix element of Oaµ , and the renormalization constants Z2(2) can be extracted from the ERBL kernel with the one- and two-loop re-
sult given in [9, 39] and [40­44], respectively. Inserting
Eqs. (4), (11), and (12) into Eq. (10) and comparing coefficients of O2µ,E (0) at a given order in as leads to the following "master formulas" for the CF at the various

4

loop orders

T2(0) = TE(0) = A(20) ,

T2(1) = A(21) -

a=2,E

T2(2) = A(22) + Z(1)A(21) -

Za(22-k)  Ta(k) . (13)

a=2,E k=0

To arrive at these formulas, a few additional relations such as A(2 ) = A(E), ZE(1E) = Z2(12) and Z2(1E) = 0 have been used. All quantities multiplied by a divergent term in (13) (only T2(1) in our case) must be expanded beyond O( 0) to correctly capture all finite terms.
The master formula (13) was derived under the as-
sumption that dimensional regularization is used on both
sides of Eq. (10) for both UV and IR divergences. However, to determine the UV-renormalization constants Za(b) we apply the following procedure (see e.g. [19, 45]). The
bare matrix elements of the effective operators are ex-
pressed as follows

Oaµ = ab + as Ma(1b) + Za(1b) + a2s Ma(2b) + Za(2b) +Za(12)  M2(b1) + O(a3s)  Obµ (0) , (14)

and the matrix elements Ma(b) are obtained with dimensional regularization applied only to the UV divergences but with the IR regularization scheme being different from the dimensional one. Renormalizing the matrix elements of the evanescent operator to zero yields the relations
ZE(12) = -ME(12) , ZE(22) = -ME(22) + ME(12)  M2(21) , (15)
where ZE(22) is IR finite as expected albeit both ME(22) and M2(21) are IR divergent at O( 0).
Collecting all individual pieces in (13) together, we observe explicitly that all the -poles are canceled as expected, serving as a nontrivial validation for our result. Besides, our result for the color structure CF 0 is in full agreement with the previous computation [16]. We present the explicit expressions of the distinct pieces in (13) in the supplemental material, including the final analytic result of T2(2) itself. Subsequently, the complete next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) resummation of log(Q2/2QCD) appearing in (3) is achieved by virtue of the three-loop evolution equation of (x, µF ) in the naive dimensional regularization (NDR) scheme [46], which is implemented throughout our computation. If instead, the IR subtraction program is executed in the Larin scheme of 5 [47], the corresponding T2(2) can be derived from (13) by switching off the evanescent contributions together with the Larin scheme result for Z22 [48].

NUMERICAL ANALYSIS

Having at our disposal the NNLL hard-collinear factorization formula of the TFF at the LP accuracy, we are now ready to explore the numerical implications of the newly derived two-loop correction to the CF, which necessitates the non-perturbative information of the twisttwo pion DA. To characterize the non-asymptotic behavior of (x, µ0) at the reference scale µ0 = 1 GeV, we will employ three phenomenologically acceptable models motivated by accommodating the available constraints on the Gegenbauer moments a2n(µ0) (n  1) from the various QCD methods,

(x, µ0) =

(16)

with (µ0) = 0.422+-00..007667 ;

Model II : {a2, a4}(µ0) = {0.269(47), 0.185(62)} , {a6, a8}(µ0) = {0.141(96), 0.049(116)} ;

Model III : {a2, a4}(µ0) = {0.203+-00..006597 , -0.143+-00..009847} .
Model I is inspired from the AdS/QCD correspondence [49] with modifications from the most recent lattice result a2(2 GeV) = 0.116+-00..001290 [50]. The construction of Model II based upon the truncated expansion in Gegenbauer polynomials is achieved by matching the light-cone QCD sum rules of the pion electromagnetic form factor in the space-like region onto the modified dispersion integral of the modulus of the time-like form factor [51]. The intervals of a2 and a4 in Model III [52­54] are determined from the QCD sum rule with the non-local quark condensate accounting for the finite correlation length of vacuum fluctuations [55] (see, however, [56]). To facilitate the implementation of the three-loop renormalization group evolution of the leading-twist pion DA [46, 57], we will apply the Gegenbauer expansion for the "holographic"-type Model I by discarding a2n(µ0) with n  7, which turns out to be a sufficiently good approximation as demonstrated in [56].
Adopting Model I as our default choice, we present in Fig. 2 the resulting impacts of QCD radiative corrections to the TFF at LP as well as the numerical features of the power suppressed terms from the twist-four collinear dynamics of the pion system [58] and from the long-distance photon correction [19]. Inspecting the numerical patterns the various dynamical mechanisms displayed in Fig. 2 implies that the NNLL twist-two correction can reduce the corresponding NLL prediction by an amount of approximately (4  7) % at Q2  [3, 40] GeV2, while the genuine one-loop perturbative correction is responsible for a constant  10% reduction of the LL contribution in the same kinematic domain. By contrast, adding together the factorizable and nonfactorizable subleading contributions discussed above brings about the negligible corrections [19]. We are then led to conclude that the full

Theory predictions of the TFF   0 for the three models presented in (16), including the NNLL QCD prediction of the leading- and sub-leading power corrections from the higher-twist pion and photon DAs. The color bands are due to variation of the factorization/renormalization scale µ. For a comparison, we also display the experimental measurements from the CLEO [5] (purple squares), BaBar [6] (orange circles) and Belle [7] (brown spades) Collaborations.

two-loop computation of the LP effect in the TFF accomplished here is indeed of an extraordinary phenomenological significance, which will definitely be beneficial for further advancing the perturbative QCD techniques to tackle the exquisite strong interaction dynamics of hard exclusive reactions. In addition, it has been explicitly verified that the appearing hierarchical structures of the higher-order corrections in the double expansions in powers of s and 2QCD/Q2 in Fig. 2 also apply to the remaining two complementary models in (16).
We proceed to present in Fig. 3 the final theory predictions of the TFF for the three phenomenological models of the leading-twist pion DA, which are further compared to the experimental data. As the dominating non-perturbative uncertainties of our numerical analysis from the shape parameters of (x, µ0) can be inferred from the yielding discrepancies of the obtained theoretical results for the distinct sample models, the quoted uncertainties in (16) are not taken into account in the three shaded (red, green, gray) bands in Fig. 3 to highlight the perturbative uncertainty of the NNLL resummation improved computation of the LP contribution stemming from the "default" variation of the factorization/renormalization scale µ2 = x Q2 with 1/4  x  3/4 [56]. The distinctive snapshot of the well-separated uncertainty bands for the three models under discussion is particularly encouraging to differentiate numerous speculations on the intricate behaviors of the twist-two pion DA quantitatively with the aid of the future precision Belle II measurements. Furthermore, the

theory predictions of the incomplete two-loop computation of the leading-power contribution to F(Q2) in the large 0 approximation are observed to differ from our full O(s2) results by almost a factor of two at high-Q2. We also mention in passing that our primary objective consists in the first-principles predictions of the exclusive    0 form factor at large momentum transfer rather than in the lower-Q2 region, where the non-factorizable soft correction suppressed by a factor of  1.5 GeV2/Q2 with respect of the leading-twist contribution is expected to be pronounced according to the dispersion analysis with the parton-hadron duality ansatz.
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we have endeavored to carry out, for the first time, the complete two-loop computation of the leading-twist contribution to the photon-pion form factor in the hard-collinear factorization framework. The phenomenological significance of such higher-order perturbative effect was further addressed by employing the three non-perturbative models of the twist-two pion DA. The genuine O(s2) correction to the hard matching coefficient was demonstrated to be numerically comparable to the counterpart one-loop contribution at Q2  [3, 40] GeV2, and in particular, the previously evaluated radiative correction at O(s2 0) only accounts for a moderate portion (approximately O(50 %)) of the full NNLL QCD effect. Moreover, our improved theory predictions of the form factor    0 appears to be promising to discriminate

6

a wide range of the phenomenological (x, µ0) models. We are therefore confident that the established two-loop SCET factorization formula of the photon-pion form factor will be of notable importance for exploiting in general the many facets of the strong interaction dynamics embedded in hard exclusive reactions.

The harmonic polylogarithms (HPLs) are defined recursively by

logn(x) ,

Ha1,a2,...,an (x) =

For the weight functions we have f0(t) = 1/t and f1(t) = 1/t¯, together with the notation Ha1,...,ai,...,an = Ha1,...,0ai-1,1,...,an for the integer ai  2. We also find that all the HPL functions that we have are repre-
sentable in the form of simple Lin functions of argument

{x, x¯, -x/x¯} with n = 1, 2, 3, 4. Note that the terms in (29) proportional to x are reproducible directly from the coefficient function in DIS.
