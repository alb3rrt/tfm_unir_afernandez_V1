1. Introduction

The study of elastic curves was initiated in 1691 by Jacob Bernoulli and it was continued by Euler who introduced, in his book of 1744, the methods of Calculus of Variations. In his masterpiece, Euler introduced a complete characterization of elasticae curves. Since then, the name elasticae refers to curves which are critical points for the energy functional

2 d ,
r
where  is the curvature of the curve r. Since the fundamental papers by Langer and Singer

[17, 18, 19], where the equations of elasticae have been integrated, the study of the Euler

functional has been very vast. We refer here, for instance, to a recent and very interesting

research on the elastic networks (see [1, 11] and references therein).

Elastic energies play an important role in physical applications: we just mention, for in-

stance, the study of slender biological systems, like DNA, knotted or unknotted proteins [7, 9],

or the construction of engineering structures, like cables or pipelines [25].

In the literature, we can find also energy functionals that penalize both curvature and

torsion. For instance, in 1930 Sadowsky [22, 23] (see [15, 16] for an English translation)

studied the equilibria of a developable M¨obius strip by minimizing the bending energy. He

argued that when the M¨obius strip shrinks to its centerline, the energy reduces to a functional

which depends on the curvature and the torsion of the centerline itself. The original form of

the Sadowsky energy functional is given by

(2 +  2)2

r

d,

where  is the torsion of r. Later, also Langer and Singer [20] considered an energy functional

which penalizes both the curvature and the torsion of the centerline of an elastic rod. Precisely,

In this paper, we want to study a more general energy density function depending both

on the curvature  and the torsion  of the curve. In other words, we are dealing with the

following type of elastic energy functional:

f (,  ) d .
r

(1.1)

We are interested in the existence of minimizers of (1.1) among closed curves with fixed length,

and in a characterization of its critical points. The corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations

without constraints have already been obtained but, up to our knowledge, for curves of class

at least C2: for instance, in [6, 26] the authors employ the Serret-Frenet frame to describe

the geometry of the curves and to compute the first variation. Moreover, we obtain a system

of first-order differential equations which is not in normal form but embedding the closure of

the curve, a fact generally difficult to implement.

Differently from classical approaches [19], where the independent variable of the energy

functional is a parametrized curve and in order to introduce a model for an elastic curve as physical as possible [8], here we require that the elastic curve is C1 but not necessarily C2. By this, we cannot adopt the Serret-Frenet frame description, for which the regularity of the curve has to be at least C2. We adopt here the approach of the framed curves with the constraints of C1-closedness and a natural condition t · b = 0. Framed curves were

introduced by Schuricht et al. [14] to describe the physical behavior of elastic curves under

additional topological constraints (see also [24]), while the condition t · b = 0 arises in a

natural way from a Gamma-limit procedure exploited by Freddi et al. [10] to investigate the

dimensional reduction of an elastic M¨obius strip.

The paper is organized as follows. First of all, in Section 2, we introduce the mathematical

setting of the framed curves showing how to reconstruct a space curve starting from its (weak)

curvature and torsion and we introduce the elastic energy functional. Next, in Section 3, we

prove the first main result, i.e. the existence of energy minimizers. Then, in Section 4, we

find as a second result, the first-order necessary conditions for minimizers using essentially

the infinite-dimensional version of the Lagrange multipliers' method. Finally, in Section 5, we

consider some examples arising from biological or engineering applications and we perform

numerical examples to visualize the shape of critical points.

The variational analysis of functionals of type (1.1) is a fundamental preliminary in view

to consider the more complicated physical situation where a soap film spans an elastic in-

extensible curve. This study will be managed in the spirit of the one carried out for the

Kirchhoff-Plateau problem (see [12, 13, 3, 4, 5] and references therein) and it will be the

content of a forthcoming paper.

2. Framed curves and elastic energy

We introduce framed curves following, up to some variants, the approach presented in [14].
We denote by SO(3) the set of all 3 × 3 rotation matrices: in other words, (u|v|w)  SO(3) means that {u, v, w} is a positively oriented orthonormal basis of R3. Fix L > 0 and p > 1. On a triple (t|n|b)  W 1,p((0, L); SO(3)) we put the following constraints:

t · b = 0, a.e. on (0, L),
L
t ds = 0,
0
t(L) = t(0),
where t(L) and t(0) are intended in the sense of traces. We let
W = {(t|n|b)  W 1,p((0, L); SO(3)) : (2.1)-(2.2)-(2.3) hold true}.

(2.1) (2.2) (2.3)

Let f : [0, L] × R × R  R be measurable. We define the energy functional E : W  R  {+}
as
L
E(t|n|b) = f (s, t · n, n · b) ds.
0

2.1. Geometrical interpretation. Fix (t|n|b)  W and x0  R3. We consider the map r : [0, L]  R3 defined by
s
r(s) = x0 + t dr.
0
In other words, r is the curve clamped at the point x0 and generated by the orthonormal
frame {t, n, b}. First of all r is parametrized by the arclength since |r | = |t| = 1. Condition
(2.2) says that r is a closed curve, that is r(0) = r(L). Moreover, condition (2.3) says

that the tangent vector to r is continuous, that is r (0) = r (L). We also point out that r belongs to W 2,p((0, L); R3) but, in general, it does not belong to W 3,p((0, L); R3) even if n  W 1,p((0, L); R3). Hence, the regularity of admissible curves is in between C1 and C2. Finally, we let

 = t · n,  = n · b.

Notice that ,   Lp(0, L). It is easy to see that condition (2.1) implies that the following

system holds

  t = n, 
n = -t +  b,

(2.4)

 

b

= - n,

which looks like the usual Serret-Frenet system of r. For that reason,  and  can be regarded as the (signed) weak curvature of r and the weak torsion of r respectively. However, we remark that while in classical Differential Geometry the torsion of a space curve is not defined at a point where the curvature vanishes, for us the quantity n · b is always defined.

3. Minimizers of E Our first main result is the existence of minimizers for E.

Theorem 3.1. Assume that: f (·, a, b)  L1(0, L) for any a, b  R,
f (s, ·) is continuous and convex for any s  [0, L], f (s, a, b)  c1|a|p + c2|b|p + c3 for any a, b  R,
for some c1, c2 > 0, c3  R. Then E has a minimizer on W .

Proof. We divide the proof into three steps.

(3.1) (3.2) (3.3)

Step 1. We claim that infW E < +. Consider

t(s) = - sin

2s L

e1 + cos

2s L

e2,

n(s) = - cos

2s L

e1 - sin

2s L

e2,

and

b(s) = e3

where {e1, e2, e3} is the canonical basis of R3. It is easy to see that (t|n|b)  W . Moreover,

 = (t)

· n

=

42 L2 ,

 = (n) · b = 0.

Hence

L
E(t|n|b) = f

0

from which the claim follows.

42 s, L2 , 0

(3.1)
ds < +

Step 2. We prove that W is sequentially closed with respect to the weak convergence of W 1,p((0, L); R3×3). In order to prove this, let (th|nh|bh) be a sequence in W that converges weakly in W 1,p((0, L); R3×3) to (t|n|b). In particular, th 1,p, nh 1,p, bh 1,p are bounded. Taking into account the Sobolev compact embedding W 1,p((0, L); R3)  C0([0, L]; R3) we can

say that, up to a subsequence not relabeled, (th|nh|bh)  (t|n|b) uniformly on [0, L]. Now, since for any s  [0, L] we have (th(s)|nh(s)|bh(s))  SO(3) and SO(3) is closed in R3×3 we deduce that (t(s)|n(s)|b(s))  SO(3) for any s  [0, L] since the uniform convergence implies

the pointwise convergence. For the same reason condition (2.2) is preserved in the limit as

well as the constraint (2.3). It remains to prove that (2.1) passes to the limit. Since th  t weakly in Lp(0, L) and bh  b uniformly on [0, L] we can say that th · bh  t · b weakly in Lp(0, L). Hence

t · b p  lim inf
h+

th · bh p = 0

VARIATIONAL ANALYSIS OF INEXTENSIBLE ELASTIC CURVES

from which we obtain t · b = 0.

Step 3. The proof now uses the Direct Method of the Calculus of Variations. Let (th|nh|bh) be a minimizing sequence for E on W , that is (th|nh|bh)  W for any h  N and

lim E(th|nh|bh) = inf E.

h+

W

Since infW E < +, and by (3.3) we can say that (th|nh|bh) 1,p is bounded. Then, up to a

subsequence (not relabeled), we get (th|nh|bh) (t|n|b)  W because of the weak closure of W . As before, notice that th · nh  t · n and nh · bh  n · b both weakly in Lp(0, L). Since condition (3.2) guarantees the lower semicontinuity of E with respect to the weak topology of

Lp(0, L) we conclude that

which ends the proof.

E(t|n|b)  lim inf E(th|nh|bh) = inf E

4. Critical points of E

In this section we want to find the first-order necessary conditions for minimizers of E. In order to do this, we recall the infinite-dimensional version of the Lagrange multipliers' method. In what follows, Y denotes the topological dual of Y .

Theorem 4.1. Let X, Y be two real Banach spaces, F  C1(X) and G  C1(X; Y ). Assume that G (x) = 0 whenever G(x) = 0. Let x0  X be such that

F (x0) = min{F (x) : G(x0) = 0}.

Then there exists a Lagrange multiplier   Y such that

F (x0) = (G (x0)).

We are ready to state and prove our second main result.

Theorem 4.2. Assume that f is of class C1 and satisfies f (s, a, b)  c(1 + |a|p + |b|p)

(4.1)

and

|fa(s, a, b)|  c(1 + |a|p-1 + |b|p-1), |fb(s, a, b)|  c(1 + |a|p-1 + |b|p-1)

(4.2)

for all s  [0, L] and any a, b  R and for some c  0 (here fa =

f a

and fb =

f b

).

Let

(t|n|b)  W be a minimizer of E and let  = t · n,  = n · b. Then, fa, fb  W 1,1(0, L) and

there exist µ  Lp (0, L) with µ  Lp(0, L) and   R3 such that the following conditions

hold a.e. on (0, L):

  fb(s, ,  ) = µ 

-fa(s, ,  ) = µ +  · n

 

fb(s, ,  ) -  fa(s, ,  )

= -µ

+  · b.

(4.3)

6

G. BEVILACQUA, L. LUSSARDI, AND A. MARZOCCHI

Proof. Let X = W 1,p((0, L); R3×3). The free variable in X will be denoted again by (t|n|b).

We define the functional F : X  R by

L
F(t|n|b) = f (s, t · n, n · b) ds.
0

Fix (1|2|3)  X. Thanks to (4.2) we can differentiate under the integral sign obtaining

d d F (t + 1|n + 2|b + 3)|=0
L
= fa(s, t · n, n · b)(n · 1 + t · 2) ds +
0

L
fb(s, t · n, n · b)(b · 2 + n · 3) ds
0

=: L(1, 2, 3),

where L is a linear operator. It is easy to see that

|L(1|2|3)|  m (t|n|b) X (1|2|3) X for a suitable constant m > 0 by (4.2), the H¨older inequality and the continuous embeddings
W 1,p((0, L); R3)  C0([0, L]; R3), Lp((0, L); R3)  L1((0, L); R3). Therefore, L is also continuous and

|L(1|2|3)|  m (t|n|b) X

whenever (1|2|3) X = 1. Applying standard results of Nonlinear Analysis (see for instance [2, Sec. 1.3]), we can then conclude that F  C1(X) and

F (t|n|b)(1|2|3)

L

L

= fa(s, t · n, n · b)(n · 1 + t · 2) ds + fb(s, t · n, n · b)(b · 2 + n · 3) ds

0

0

for any (1|2|3)  X. Next, we consider the constraints. We let

Y = Lp(0, L) × Lp(0, L) × Lp(0, L) × Lp((0, L); R3) × Lp(0, L) × R3 × R3

equipped with the product topology in order to get a Banach space. We define G : X  Y as
L
G(t|n|b) = t · t - 1, n · n - 1, t · n, b - t × n, t · b, t ds, t(L) - t(0) .
0
Using the same argument as before, we can easily see that G  C1(X, Y ) and

G (t|n|b)(1|2|3)

= 2t · 1, 2b · 2, t · 2 + n · 1, 3 + n × 1 - t × 2, b · 1 + t · 3,
L
1 ds, 1(L) - 1(0) .
0
Moreover, G (t|n|b) = 0 for any (t|n|b)  X such that G(t|n|b) = 0. Then, by construction a minimizer of E is a constrained minimizer of F on {G = 0}. From now on, (t|n|b) denotes

VARIATIONAL ANALYSIS OF INEXTENSIBLE ELASTIC CURVES

such a minimizer. For simplicity of notation we also let fa = fa(s, ,  ) and fb = fb(s, ,  ). Applying Theorem 4.1, we can say that there exist Lagrange multipliers 1, 2, 3  Lp (0, L), 4  Lp ((0, L); R3), µ  Lp (0, L),   R3 such that

for any (1|2|3)  W01,p((0, L); R3×3). Using 1 = 2 = 0 and the arbitrariness of 3 we easily obtain

4 = -µt + fbn . Now, using 1 = 3 = 0 and 2 = b with   Cc1(0, L) we deduce that

-fb = 4 · n = -µ t · n

which is (4.3)1. Next, taking 1 = 3 = 0 and 2 = t we easily get

3 = 0.

Finally, considering 2 = 3 = 0 and 1 = n or 1 = b we arrive at

-fa =  · n + µ n · b,

which is (4.3)2 and

(t · n)fb - (n · b)fa = -µ +  · b.

which is exactly (4.3)3, and the proof is complete.

Remark 4.3. We point out that from (4.4) we can deduce other conditions that permit us to find 1 and 2, useless for our purposes. For the sake of completeness we give the complete system of conditions obtained from (4.4):



 (t · n)fa = 21 - 4 · b +  · t,

choosing 1 = t, 2 = 3 = 0, choosing 1 = n, 2 = 3 = 0, choosing 1 = b, 2 = 3 = 0, choosing 2 = t, 1 = 3 = 0, choosing 2 = n, 1 = 3 = 0, choosing 2 = b, 1 = 3 = 0, choosing 3 arbitrarily and 1 = 2 = 0.

We conclude this general section with the complete elimination of the Lagrange multipliers in the system (4.3), but we have to assume a priori regularity.

Theorem 4.4. Assume that f is of class C3 and let (t|n|b)  W be a solution of the system (4.3) with t, n, b of class C4. Then at any point where  = 0 we have

where fa = fa(s, ,  ) and fb = fb(s, ,  ).

Proof. Let us take a point where  = 0. From (4.3)1 we get

µ = fb . 

Now, differentiating (4.3)3, using the fact that b = - n and inserting (4.3)2 we easily get

fb 

2 = - fb - fb +  fa +  fb + 2 fa

which gives (4.5)1. Next, differentiating (4.3)2, using the fact that n = -t+ b and inserting

5. Some examples In this section we discuss some explicit examples arising from the applications.

5.1. The Euler elastica. As recalled in the introduction, the study of the Euler elastica

functional

L
2 ds

has been very vast. We refer here to the papers by Langer and Singer [17, 18, 19]. First of all, they proved that the unique global (and local) minimizer among all W 2,2 curves C1-

periodics is the circumference with length L. Concerning critical points, there is essentially another planar and C1-periodic critical point, which is known in literature as lemniscate (an

eight-figure). A great variety of space critical points in the same class of admissible curves

can be obtained and all of them lie on an embedded torus of revolution. Finally, many other

VARIATIONAL ANALYSIS OF INEXTENSIBLE ELASTIC CURVES

9

critical points can be found if we do not assume the closedness of the curve (free elasticae). As proved by Langer and Singer [18], the general equations of elasticae are given by
2 - 2 2 + 3 - c1 = 0 2 = c2
where c1, c2 are constants (free elasticae are obtained for c1 = 0). Following our notation, we get the Euler functional choosing f (s, a, b) = a2. In this case
condition (3.3) is not satisfied so we are not able to apply our Theorem 3.1 in order to get minimizers, at least for space curves. Nevertheless, conditions (4.1) and (4.2) are satisfied, so that, we are able to apply Theorem 4.2, since we know that at least a minimizer exists.

Theorem 5.1. Let E : W  R  {+} be given by
L
E(t|n|b) = 2 ds.
0
Let (t|n|b)  W be a minimizer of E. Let S = {s  [0, L] : (s) = 0}. Then S is negligible. Moreover,   W 2,2(0, L),   W 1,2(0, L) and there exist c1, c2  R such that

2 - 2 2 + 3 - c1 = 0 2 = c2

(5.1)

everywhere on [0, L].

Proof. Since f (s, a, b) = a2 we get fa = 2a and fb = 0. We are in position to apply Theorem 4.2. The system (4.3) reads as

  µ = 0 
 · n = -2 - µ

 

 · b = -2

+µ

(5.2)

for some µ  W 1,2(0, L) and   R3. In particular, (5.2)2 gives   W 1,2(0, L). Now we divide the proof into some steps.

Step 1. Since (5.2)1 we get µ|[0,L]\S = 0. Hence, from (5.2)3 we obtain |[0,L]\S  W 1,2([0, L]\S).

Step 3. We prove now that   W 2,2(0, L). Since  is continuous, S is relatively closed

in [0, L]. Hence, we can write it as
+
S = Sh
h=0
where Sh are pairwise disjoint and Sh is either a singleton or a closed interval with non-empty interior. On each Sh = [ah, bh] with ah < bh we change  as follows:

¯(s)

=



(a-h )

+

 (b+h ) bh

- -

 (a-h ) (s ah

-

ah),

s  [ah, bh],

10

G. BEVILACQUA, L. LUSSARDI, AND A. MARZOCCHI

where  (a-h ),  (b+h ) are the left and right traces of  respectively at ah and bh, with the convention  (0-) =  (L+) = 0. By construction, we obtain ¯  W 1,2(0, L) and ¯ =  on
[0, L] \ S. Let (t¯|n¯ |b¯)  W 1,2((0, L); R3) be the unique solution of the Cauchy problem

 t¯ = n¯



   

n¯

= -t¯+ ¯b¯

  

b¯

= -¯n¯

 t¯(0) = t(0)



  

n¯ (0)

=

n(0)



 

b¯(0)

=

b(0).

It is easy to see that (t¯|n¯ |b¯)  W (notice that actually t¯ = t everywhere). Moreover, E(t¯|n¯ |b¯) = E(t|n|b), hence (t¯|n¯ |b¯) is still a minimizer of E. Applying Theorem 4.2 again, we

deduce that

  µ¯ = 0 
¯ · n¯ = -2 - µ¯¯

 

¯ · b¯ = -2¯ + µ¯

(5.3)

for some µ¯  W 1,2(0, L) and ¯  R3. As a consequence of (5.3)2 we obtain   W 2,2(0, L).

Step 4. We claim that for any relatively open interval I  ([0, L] \ S) there exists cI  R such

that

2 - 2 2 + 3 - cI  = 0, on I.

(5.4)

First, on I the system (5.2) reduces to

 · n = -2  · b = -2.

(5.5)

Differentiating (5.5)1 we get  · n = -2 . Since n = -t +  b we obtain 2 = - · t +   · b  W 1,2(I),

from which   W 3,2(I). In particular,   C2(I). Combining n = -t +  b with (5.5)2 we

deduce

2 - 2 2 =  · t, on I. 

(5.6)

As a consequence we obtain

2 - 2 2 + 2 =  · t + 2 =  · n + 2 = 0 

where the last equality follows from (5.5)1. Then, since I is an interval, there exists cI  R

such that which proves the claim.

2 

- 2 2 + 2 = cI ,

on I,

Step 5. We prove that S is negligible. First of all, it cannot be  = 0 everywhere, because of the constraint (2.2). In order to see that S is negligible it is sufficient to show that in the decomposition of {Sh}hN there is no Sh with non-empty interior. Assume by contradiction that there exists Sh = [ah, bh] with ah < bh. Then, either ah  (0, L) or bh  (0, L). Without loss of generality we can assume bh  (0, L) (the argument for ah is the same). Then  = 0 on (bh, bh + ) for some  > 0, so that   C2([bh, bh + ]) and using (5.4) we can say that
2 - 2 2 + 3 - ch = 0, on (bh, bh + )

for some ch  R. As a consequence we deduce that  is a solution of the Cauchy problem

  2

- 2 2 + 3 - ch = 0,



(bh) = 0

 

 (bh)

=

0

on (bh, bh + )

which means that  = 0 on (bh, bh + ), that is a contradiction.

Step 6. We can now conclude the proof. Since S is negligible, we immediately deduce that   W 1,2(0, L). It remains to show (5.1). Observe that the function
2 - 2 2 + 2  is piecewise constant and it coincides with  · t a.e. t  [0, L], As a consequence, 2 - 2 2 + 2  must be constant, which ends the proof.
5.1.1. Numerical results. In this paragraph we show some numerical results obtained using the software Mathematica (Wolfram Inc., version 12) concerning solutions of the system (5.1). We do separate analysis for planar curves and for space curves.

Planar curves. In this case c2 = 0. First of all, we pass to the general Cauchy problem

for , namely

23 

+ 6 - c14 = 0,





(0) = 0,

(5.7)

  (0) = 1.

The idea is to integrate numerically the system (5.7) and then try to reconstruct the shape of the curve. Without loss of generality we can look for the curve r : [0, L]  R2

In other words, we require the curve to be clamped at the origin which "starts" with the

canonical orthonormal frame. However, we point out that in general it is not necessarily true

that r is admissible: for instance we do not have implemented any closedness of r. From

Differential Geometry, it is known that the necessary and sufficient conditions for a planar

curve to be closed are the equalities

We also anticipate the fact that for space curves there are no similar conditions on ,  in

order to guarantee that the curve is closed. For details we refer to [21]. Actually, for numerical

reasons we decide to introduce a stop condition in the numeric integration of (5.7)­(5.8): we vary randomly the constants c1, 0, 1 until the inequality

d = |r(L)| + |t(L) - (1, 0)| < 10-6

(5.9)

is satisfied. Condition (5.9) formally implies that the obtained curve r is almost closed as well as its tangent vector.

To find closed spatial curves, we use the stop condition

similar to the one introduced in the plane. The results for closed elasticae are reported in Fig. 3 and in the corresponding Table 3. Without (5.10) the curves maybe open and we report some examples in Fig. 4 and Table 4.

It is straightforward to see that f satisfies all the assumptions (3.1)-(3.2)-(3.3)-(4.1)-(4.2) with the choice p = 2. As a consequence we have existence of minimizers. Of course, since plane curves have  = 0 as in the case of the Euler elastica the circumference of length L is still a minimizer. Concerning critical points, first of all, we notice that f is smooth and we

   = µ, 
 · n = - - µ,

 

·b=µ.

(5.12)

It is easy to see that the solutions ,  of that system are smooth and we can therefore apply Theorem 4.4. Then, on any interval I where  = 0 we have

These equations look quite difficult and hold true only when  = 0. The only fact we put in evidence is that (5.13)2 can be rewritten as

(5.14)

Concerning the numerical analysis we tried to reproduce the same arguments to solve (5.14). However, we did not succeed in varying randomly the constant c and the initial conditions for ,  , since it is very likely that  = 0 at some time, thus stopping the numerical procedure. We show the results in Fig. 5 and in Table 5.

functional takes the form

Some authors tried to give a rigorous justification of the limit process. We mention only the

paper by Freddi et al. [10] (further references can be found therein), where the authors studied

the -limit of the bending energy on the M¨obius strip with respect to a topology that ensures

the convergence of the minimizers. In this way, they obtain as -limit the functional

where f : R2  R is given by

f (a, b) =

if |a| > |b|, if |a|  |b|.

(5.15)

Such a functional turns out to be the corrected version of the Sadowsky functional. It is easy

to see that f is continuous and convex: in order to see the convexity, we notice that that if f1 : R2 \ {(a, b)  R2 : a > 0}  R and f2 : R2  R are given by

(a2 + b2)2 f1(a, b) = a2 ,

f2(a, b) = 4b2,

then f1, f2 are both of class C1 and convex and f1(a, b) = f2(a, b) whenever a = |b| > 0.

Then, (3.2) is satisfied. Moreover,

(a2 + b2)2 a2

= a2

VARIATIONAL ANALYSIS OF INEXTENSIBLE ELASTIC CURVES

while if |a|  |b| we get 4b2  2b2 + 2a2  a2 + 2b2. As a consequence,

f (a, b)  a2 + 2b2

which shows (3.3) with p = 2. We are therefore in position to apply Theorem 3.1, hence we have existence of minimizers.

Remark 5.2. The system of critical points for the Sadowsky functional takes a very complicated form due to the fact that the energy density Eq. (5.15) depends on the value of the curvature. Hence, we are not going to write explicitly the first-order conditions for minimizers since we think that the pure numerically investigation of this kind of system is out of the purpose of this paper.
