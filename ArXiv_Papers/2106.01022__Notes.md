## Abstract

}. We calculate network characteristics and show that they cannot follow as a result of several simple commonly used network growth models. In turn, we suggest that simultaneous account of two factors, growth by blocks and preferential selection, gives an explanation of empirically observed properties of the concepts network. Moreover, the observed structure emerges as a synergistic effect of both of these factors: each of them alone does not lead to a satisfactory picture.
