## Abstract

This letter presents experimental results and reveals that strong perturbations are not necessary for elastic instability to occur in straight channel visco-elastic flows. Our analysis shows that a non-normal mode bifurcation is followed by elastic waves on top of chaotic fluctuations at higher frequencies. This persists in the transition, elastic turbulence, and drag reduction regimes with a non-monotonic variation of the intensity. Furthermore, our measurements allow us to obtain the dependence of the wave velocity on $\mathrm{Wi}$ and confirm their linear dispersion for the first time directly.
