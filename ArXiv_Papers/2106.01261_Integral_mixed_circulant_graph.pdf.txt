Abstract
A mixed graph is said to be integral if all the eigenvalues of its Hermitian adjacency matrix are integer. The mixed circulant graph Circ(Zn, C) is a mixed graph on the vertex set Zn and edge set {(a, b) : b - a  C}, where 0  C. If C is closed under inverse, then Circ(Zn, C) is called a circulant graph. We express the eigenvalues of Circ(Zn, C) in terms of primitive n-th roots of unity, and find a sufficient condition for integrality of the eigenvalues of Circ(Zn, C). For n  0 (mod 4), we factorize the cyclotomic polynomial into two irreducible factors over Q(i). Using this factorization, we characterize integral mixed circulant graphs in terms of its symbol set. We also express the integer eigenvalues of an integral oriented circulant graph in terms of a Ramanujan type sum, and discuss some of their properties.

1 Introduction
We only consider graphs without loops and multi-edges. A (simple) graph G is denoted by G = (V (G), E(G)), where V (G) is the vertex set of G, and the edge set E(G)  V (G) × V (G) \ {(u, u)|u 
1

V (G)} with (u, v)  E(G) if and only if (v, u)  E(G). A graph G is said to be oriented if (u, v)  E(G)

implies that (v, u)  E(G). A graph G is said to be mixed if (u, v)  E(G) does not always imply that

(v, u)  E(G), see [21] for details. In a mixed graph G, we call an edge with end vertices u and v to be

undirected (resp. directed ) if both (u, v) and (v, u) belong to E(G) (resp. only one of (u, v) and (v, u)

belongs to E(G)). An undirected edge (u, v) is denoted by u  v, and a directed edge (u, v) is denoted

by u  v. Hence, a mixed graph can have both directed and undirected edges. Note that, if all edges

of a mixed graph G are directed (resp. undirected) then G is an oriented graph (resp. a simple graph).

For a mixed graph G, the underlying graph GU of G is the simple undirected graph in which all edges of G are considered undirected. By the terms of order, size, number of components, degree of a vertex,

distance between two vertices etc., we mean that they are the same as in their underlying graphs.

In 2015, Liu and Li [21] introduced Hermitian adjacency matrix of a mixed graph. For a mixed graph

with n vertices, its Hermitian adjacency matrix is denoted by H(G) = (huv)n×n, where huv is given by

huv =

 

-i







 

0

if (u, v)  E and (v, u)  E, if (u, v)  E and (v, u)  E, if (u, v)  E and (v, u)  E, otherwise.

 Here i = -1 is the imaginary number unit. Hermitian adjacency matrix of a mixed graph incorporates

both adjacency matrix of simple graph and skew adjacency matrix of an oriented graph. The Hermitian

spectrum of G, denoted by SpH (G), is the multi set of the eigenvalues of H(G). It is easy to see that H(G) is a Hermitian matrix and so SpH(G)  R.
A mixed graph is said to be integral if all the eigenvalues of its Hermitian adjacency matrix are integers.

Integral graphs were first defined by Harary and Schwenk in 1974 [16] and proposed a classification of

integral graphs. See [5] for a survey on integral graphs. Watanabe and Schwenk [29, 30] proved several

interesting results on integral trees in 1979. Csikvari [13] constructed integral trees with arbitrary large

diameters in 2010. Further research on integral trees can be found in [9, 8, 27, 28]. In 2009, Ahmadi et al. [2] proved that only a fraction of 2-(n) of the graphs on n vertices have an integral spectrum.

Bussemaker et al. [10] proved that there are exactly 13 connected cubic integral graphs. Stevanovi´c [26]

studied the 4-regular integral graphs avoiding ±3 in the spectrum, and Lepovi´c et al. [20] proved that

there are 93 non-regular, bipartite integral graphs with maximum degree four. In 2017, Guo et. al. [15]

found all possible mixed graphs on n vertices with spectrum (-n + 1, -1, -1, ..., -1).

Let  be a group, C   and C does not contain identity element of . The set C is said to be symmetric (resp. skew-symmetric) if C is closed under inverse (resp. a-1  C for all a  C). Define C = {u  C : u-1  C}. Clearly C \ C is symmetric and C is skew-symmetric. The mixed Cayley graph G = Cay(, C) is a mixed graph, where V (G) =  and E(G) = {(a, b) : a, b  , ba-1  C}. Since we

2

have not assumed that C is symmetric, so mixed Cayley graph can have directed edges. If C is symmetric,

then G is a (simple) Cayley graph. If C is skew-symmetric then G is an oriented Cayley graph.

In 1982, Bridge and Mena [7] introduced a characterization of integral Cayley graphs over abelian

group. Later on, same characterization was rediscovered by Wasin So [25] for cyclic groups in 2005.

In 2009, Abdollahi and Vatandoost [1] proved that there are exactly seven connected cubic integral

Cayley graphs. On the same year, Klotz and Sander [18] proved that if Cayley graph Cay(, C) over

abelian group  is integral then C belongs to the Boolean algebra B() generated by the subgroups of

. Moreover, they conjectured that the converse is also true, which has been proved by Alperin and

Peterson [4]. In 2014, Cheng et al. [19] proved that normal Cayley graphs (its generating set C is closed

under conjugation) over symmetric groups are integral. Alperin [3] gave a characterization of integral

Cayley graphs over finite groups. In 2017, Lu et al. [22] gave necessary and sufficient condition for the

integrality of Cayley graphs over dihedral group Dn = a, b|an = b2 = 1, bab = a-1 . In particular, they completely determined all integral Cayley graphs over the dihedral group Dp for a prime p. In 2019, Cheng et al.[11] obtained several simple sufficient conditions for the integrality of Cayley graphs over

dicyclic group T4n = a, b|a2n = 1, an = b2, b-1ab = a-1 . In particular, they also completely determined all integral Cayley graphs over the dicyclic group T4p for a prime p. However, it is far from being solved to obtain an explicit characterization of integral mixed Cayley graphs. As a simple attempt to this aspect,

in this present paper, we give a characterization of integral mixed Cayley graph over cyclic group. If

 = Zn then the mixed Cayley graph Cay(Zn, C) is known as mixed circulant graph, we denote it by Circ(Zn, C). If C is symmetric then Circ(Zn, C) is a (simple) circulant graph. If C is skew-symmetric then Circ(Zn, C) is an oriented circulant graph.
This paper is organized as follows. In second section, we express the eigenvalues of a mixed circulant

graph as a sum of eigenvalues of a simple circulant graph and an oriented Cayley graph. In third section,

for n  0 (mod 4), we obtain a sufficient condition on the set C for integral mixed circulant graphs.

In fourth section, for n  0 (mod 4), we obtain two monic irreducible factors 1n(x) and 3n(x) of the cyclotomic polynomial n(x) over Q(i) such that n(x) = 1n(x).3n(x). Note that for n  0 (mod 4),

the cyclotomic polynomial n(x) is irreducible over Q(i). We prove, for even positive integer n, that

n/2 =

(n/d), where Dn is the set of all odd divisors of n. In fifth section, we characterize integral

dDn

mixed circulant graphs in terms of its symbol set. In the last section, we express the integer eigenvalues

of an integral oriented circulant graph in terms of a Ramanujan type sum, and discuss some of their

properties.

where each row is a cyclic shift of the row above it. We see that the (j, k)-th entry of C is ck-j (mod n). We denote such a circulant matrix by C = Circ(c0, ..., cn-1).

The circulant matrix C is diagonalizable by the matrix F whose k-th column is defined by

For more information on circulant matrices see [14]. Let G = Circ(Zn, C) be a mixed circulant graph
on n vertices. Let cj (mod n) = h1,j+1. We see that hjk = ck-j (mod n). So the Hermitian adjacency
matrix of a mixed circulant graph is a circulant matrix.

From Lemma 2.1, we observe that the eigenvalues of a mixed circulant graph Circ(Zn, C) are the sum of the eigenvalues of the circulant graph Circ(Zn, C \ C) and the oriented circulant graph Circ(Zn, C).
Let n  2 be a fixed positive integer. We review some basic definitions and notations from Wasin So [25]. For a divisor d of n, define Mn(d) = {d, 2d, ..., n - d}, the set of all positive multiples of d less than n. Also define Gn(d) = {k : 1  k  n - 1, gcd(k, n) = d}. It is clear that Mn(n) = Gn(n) = , Mn(d) = dM(n/d)(1) and Gn(d) = dG(n/d)(1).

Wasin So [25] characterized integral circulant graphs in the following theorem. Several results of the

paper are influenced by [25].

Theorem 2.4. [25] The circulant graph Circ(Zn, C) is integral if and only if C = Gn(d), where
dD
D  {d : d | n}.

The next lemma will help us to extend characterization of integral oriented circulant graphs to integral mixed circulant graphs.

Lemma 2.5. The mixed circulant graph Circ(Zn, C) is integral if and only if both Circ(Zn, C \ C) and Circ(Zn, C) are integral.

Proof. Let j be an integer eigenvalue of the mixed circulant graph Circ(Zn, C). By Lemma 2.1, j =

j + µj and n-j = j - µj for all j = 0, ..., n - 1, where j is an eigenvalue of Circ(Zn, C \ C) and µj is

an

eigenvalue

of

Circ(Zn, C).

Thus

j

=

j +n-j 2



Q

and

µj

=

j -n-j 2

 Q.

As

j

and

µj

are algebraic

integers, j , µj  Q implies that j and µj are integers. Thus the circulant graph Circ(Zn, C \ C) and

the oriented circulant graph Circ(Zn, C) are integral.

Conversely, assume that both Circ(Zn, C \ C) and (Zn, C) are integral. Then Lemma 2.1 implies that

Circ(Zn, C) is integral.

Since some characterization of integral circulant graphs are known from [25], in view of Lemma

2.5, it is enough to find characterization of oriented circulant graph. Note that xn = 1 if and only if

x  {wnt

:

0  t  n - 1},

where

wn

=

exp(

2i n

Therefore,

the

graph

Circ(Zn, C)

is

integral if and only if i(xk - x(n-k))  Z for all x such that xn = 1.

3 Sufficient condition for integral mixed circulant graph on n 

0 (mod 4) vertices

Let n  0 (mod 4) be a fixed positive integer throughout this section.

For a divisor d of

n 4

and r 

{0, 1, 2, 3}, define Mnr(d) = {dk : 0  dk < n, k  r (mod 4)}. For g  Z, let Dg be the set of all odd

divisors of g.

Lemma 3.1. Let n = 4dg for some d, g  Z. Then the following are true:

(i) Mn1(d) Mn3(d) =

Gn(hd).

hDg

(ii) Mn2(d) =

Gn(2hd).

hDg

(iii) Mn0(d) = Mn(4d) {0}.

Proof. (i) Let dk  Mn1(d) Mn3(d). Since k  1 or 3 (mod 4), it follows that k is an odd integer.

So gcd(k, g) = h  Dg. Hence gcd(kd, n) = gcd(kd, 4dg) = hd implies that Mn1(d) Mn3(d) 

Gn(hd). On the other hand, if x 

Gn(hd) then there exists h  Dg such that gcd(x, n) =

hDg

hDg

hd.

So there exists x0

 Z such that x = hdx0

and

gcd(x0,

n hd

)

=

1.

Since

n hd

is an even integer

and

gcd(x0,

n hd

)

=

1,

so

x

is

an

odd

multiple

of

d.

Note

that

Mn1(d)

Mn3(d) is the set of all odd

multiples of d between 0 and n. Thus x  Mn1(d) Mn3(d). Hence

Gn(hd)  Mn1(d) Mn3(d).

hDg

(ii)

Let

dk



Mn2(d)

and

h

=

gcd(

k 2

,

g

).

Since k  2 (mod 4), we see that gcd(k, 4g) = 2h.

This

gives gcd(kd, n) = gcd(kd, 4dg) = 2hd, and so Mn2(d) 

Gn(2hd). On the other hand, if

hDg

x

Gn(2hd), there exists h  Dg such that gcd(x, n) = 2hd. So there exists x0  Z such that

hDg

x

=

2hdx0

and

gcd(x0,

n 2hd

)

=

1.

Since

n 2hd

is

an

even

integer

and

gcd(x0,

n 2hd

)

=

1,

so

x0

is

an

odd

integer. Now h, x0 are odd integers, and so letting  = 2hx0, we get x = d, where   2 (mod 4).

Hence x  Mn2(d). Thus

Gn(2hd)  Mn2(d).

hDg

(iii) By definition, we have

Mn0(d) = {dk : 0  dk  n - 1, k = 4 for some   Z} = {4d : 1  4d  n - 1 for some   Z}  {0} = Mn(4d)  {0}.

Lemma 3.2. If xn = 1 and n = 4dg for some d, g  Z, then

xq  Z, for r = 0, 2.

Let n = 4dg for some d, g  Z. Since 1  Dg, Lemma 3.1 gives Gn(d)  Mn1(d)  Mn3(d). For r  {1, 3}, define
Grn(d) = {dk : k  r (mod 4), gcd(dk, n) = d}.
In the next lemma, we prove that Gn(d) is a disjoint union of G1n(d) and G3n(d). For r  {1, 3}, define Dgr to be the set of all odd divisors of g which are congruent to r modulo 4. Note that Dg = Dg1 Dg3.

Lemma 3.4. If n = 4dg for some d, g  Z, then the following hold:

(i) G1n(d)  G3n(d) = .

(ii) Gn(d) = G1n(d)  G3n(d).

(iii) Mn1(d) =

G1n(hd) 

G3n(hd) .

hDg1

hDg3

(iv) Mn3(d) =

G3n(hd) 

G1n(hd) .

hDg1

hDg3

Proof. (i) It is clear from the definition of G1n(d) and G3n(d) that G1n(d)  G3n(d) = .

(ii) Since G1n(d)  Gn(d) and G3n(d)  Gn(d), so G1n(d)  G3n(d)  Gn(d). On the other hand, if x  Gn(d) then x = d for some . Note that gcd(, n) = 1, so  is an odd integer. Thus   1 (mod 4) or   3 (mod 4). Hence Gn(d)  G1n(d)  G3n(d).

(iii) Let dk  Mn1(d) so that k  1 (mod 4). Lemma 3.1 gives an h  Dg satisfying dk  Gn(hd). Thus dk  G1n(hd) or dk  G3n(hd), by part (ii). Case 1: Assume that h  1 (mod 4).

Let, if possible, dk  G3n(hd), i.e., dk = hd, where   3 (mod 4) and gcd(, n) = 1. Then we have k = h  3 (mod 4), a contradiction. Hence dk  G1n(hd). Case 2: Assume that h  3 (mod 4).

As in Case 1, we get k  3 (mod 4), a contradiction. Hence dk  G3n(hd).

Thus Mn1(d) 

G1n(hd) 

G3n(hd) . On the other hand, if hd  G1n(hd), where

hDg1

hDg3

h  Dg1 and   1 (mod 4), we get h  1 (mod 4), i.e., hd  Mn1(d). Similarly, hd  G3n(hd) 

hd  Mn1(d). Therefore,

G1n(hd) 

G3n(hd)  Mn1(d).

hDg1

hDg3

(iv) The proof of this part is similar to the proof of part (iii).

Note that Gn(d) = dG(n/d)(1). Therefore Gn(d) = G1n(d)  G3n(d) gives that G1n(d) = dG1(n/d)(1) and G3n(d) = dG3(n/d)(1).

Theorem 4.2. [17] The cyclotomic polynomial n(x) is irreducible in Z[x].

The polynomial n(x) is irreducible over Q(i) if and only if [Q(i, wn) : Q(i)] = (n). Also Q(wn) 
does not contain the number i = -1 if and only if n  0 (mod 4). Thus, if n  0 (mod 4) then

[Q(i, wn) : Q(wn)] = 2 = [Q(i), Q], and therefore

[Q(i, wn)

:

Q(i)]

=

[Q(i, wn)

:

Q(wn)] × [Q(wn) [Q(i) : Q]

:

Q]

=

[Q(wn)

:

Q]

=

(n).

Hence for n  0 (mod 4), the polynomial n(x) is irreducible over Q(i). Let n  0 (mod 4). Then Q(i, wn) = Q(wn), and so

[Q(i, wn)

:

Q(i)]

=

[Q(i, wn) : Q] [Q(i) : Q]

=

(n) 2

.

Hence the polynomial n(x) is not irreducible over Q(i). Now we factorize n(x) into two irreducible monic polynomials over Q(i). From Lemma 3.4, we know
that Gn(1) is a disjoint union of G1n(1) and G3n(1). Define

1n(x) =

(x - wna) and 3n(x) =

(x - wna ).

Note

that

a

root

of

for

all

a  Mn3(1).

Now

proceed

as

in

part

(i)

to get the proof of this part.

Corollary 4.3.1. Let n  0 (mod 4). The factors 1n(x) and 3n(x) of n(x) are monic polynomials in Z(i)[x] of degree (n)/2.

Proof. By definition, 1n(x) and 3n(x) are monic. Also, Gn(1) = G1n(1)  G3n(1) is a disjoint union

and that |G1n(1)| = |G3n(1)|. Therefore the degree of 1n(x) and 3n(x) is (n)/2. Now we proceed

by induction on n to show that 1n(x), 3n(x)  Z(i)[x]. For n = 4, the polynomials 14(x) = x + i

and 34(x) = x - i are clearly in Z(i)[x]. Assume that 1k(x) and 3k(x) are in Z(i)[x] for k < n

n

n

and k  0 (mod 4).

By

Lemma

4.3,

1n(x)

=

x 4 -i f (x)

and

3n(x)

=

x 4 +i g(x)

,

where

f (x)

and

g(x)

are

monic polynomials. By induction hypothesis f (x), g(x)  Z(i)[x]. It follows by "long division" that

1n(x)  Z(i)[x] and 3n(x)  Z(i)[x].

Corollary 4.3.2. Let n  0 (mod 4). Then

n 2

=



n d

Proof. We get the desired equality by comparing the degree of the polynomials in Lemma 4.3.

Corollary 4.3.3. Let n be an positive even integer. Then

Proof.

Since

2n  0

(mod

for

d  Dn,

so

(

2n d

)

=

2(

n d

for

d  Dn

= D2n.

Thus

by

Corollary

4.3.4.

for

Then

1n(x) =

Theorem 4.4. Let n  0 (mod 4). The factors 1n(x) and 3n(x) of n(x) are irreducible monic

polynomials

in

Q(i)[x]

of

degree

(n) 2

.

Proof. In view of Corollary 4.3.1, we only need to show that 1n(x) and 3n(x) are irreducible in Q(i).

For

n



0

(mod

4),

we

have

[Q(i, wn) :

Q(i)]

=

(n) 2

.

So

there

is

a

unique

irreducible

monic

polynomial

p(x)



Q(i)[x]

of

degree

(n) 2

having

wn

as

a

root.

Since

wn

is

also

a

root

of

1n(x),

so

1n(x)

=

p(x).f (x),

where f (x)  Q(i)[x]. As, 1n(x) is a monic polynomial of degree (n)/2, so f (x) = 1. Hence p(x) =

1n(x).

Similarly,

for

a  G3n(1),

we

have

[Q(i, wna) : Q(i)] =

(n) 2

.

This

along

with

Corollary

4.3.1,

give

that 3n(x) is irreducible.

Define

u(d)

be

the

(n - 1)-vector,

where

u(d)k = -1



  

0

if k  G1n(d) if k  G3n(d) otherwise.

Let E = [est] be an (n - 1) × (n - 1) matrix defined by

est = iwnst.

Note that E is invertible. Using Theorem 3.5, we get Eu(d)  Zn-1. Define U = {u  Qn-1 : Eu 

Qn-1},

so

that

u(d)

 U.

Let

spanQ{u(d) : d |

n 4

}

be

the

set

of

all

linear

combination

of

{u(d)

:

d|

n 4

}

over

Q.

Therefore

spanQ{u(d) : d |

n 4

}

is

a

subspace of U over Q.

Let

E(U) = {Eu : u  U}.

Now we

propose the following lemma.

12

Lemma

5.1.

Let

n0

(mod

4).

Then

E(U) 

spanQ{u(d) : d |

n 4

}.

Proof. Let u = [u1, u2, ..., un-1]t  U and v = Eu = [v1, v2, ..., vn-1]t. Since Gn(d1)  Gn(d2) =  for d1 = d2 and Gn(d) = {1, 2, ..., n - 1}, it is enough to show the following:
d|n
(i) vs = -vn-s for all 1  s  n - 1.

(ii)

If d |

n 4

then

vs

= vt

for

all

s, t  G1n(d).

(iii)

If d 

n 4

,

d

|

n

and d < n then vr

=0

for

all r  Gn(d).

Since Eu = [v1, v2, ..., vn-1]t for 1  s  n - 1, we get

n-1

n-1

n-1

vn-s =

iujwn(n-s)j =

iujwn-sj = (-i)ujwnsj = -vs = -vs.

j=1

j=1

j=1

Assume that d |

n 4

and s, t  G1n(d), so that

s d

,

t d



G1n (1) d

and

wns ,

wnt

are roots of 1n (x). d

Again,

n-1

n-1

vs = iujwnsj  Q, and so wns is a root of the polynomial p(x) = iujxj - vs  Q(i)[x]. Therefore

j=1

j=1

p(x)

is

a

multiple

of

the

irreducible

monic

polynomial

1n (x), d

and

so

wnt

is

also

a

root

of

p(x),

i.e.

n-1

vs = iujwntj = vt. Hence vs = vt.

j=1

Now

assume

that

d



n 4

,

d

|

n,

d

<n

and

r

 Gn(d).

Then

r, n - r

 Gn(d)

and

wnr ,

wnn-r

are

roots

n-1

n-1

of

 n (x). d

Again

vr

=

iuj wnrj
j=1

 Q,

and

hence

wnr

is

a

root

of

polynomial

in

q(x)

=

iuj xj
j=1

- vr



Q(i)[x]. Therefore q(x) is a multiple of the irreducible monic polynomial  n (x). Note that  n (x) is

d

d

irreducible over Q(i) as n  0 (mod 4). Thus wnn-r is also a root of q(x), i.e., vr = n-1 iujwn(n-r)j = vn-r.

j=1

This gives vr = vn-r. Now vr = vn-r and vr = -vn-r altogether gives vr = vn-r = 0.

The next theorem is crucial in proving the necessity of the sufficient condition of Corollary 3.5.1.

Theorem

5.2.

Let

n0

(mod

4).

Then

U=

spanQ{u(d) : d |

n 4

}.

Proof.

By Lemma 5.1, E(U)  spanQ{u(d) : d |

n 4

}



U.

Since E

is invertible, we get dim E(U) = dim U,

and

hence

E(U)

=

spanQ{u(d)

:

d

n 4

}

=

U.

Theorem 5.3. Let G = Circ(Zn, C) be an oriented circulant graph.

(i) If n  0 (mod 4) then G is integral if and only if C = .

(ii) If n  0 (mod 4) then G is integral if and only if C =

Sn(d),

where

D



{d

:

d

and

dD

Sn(d) = G1n(d) or Sn(d) = G3n(d).

13

Proof. (i) Assume that G is integral. Let SpH(G) = {µ0, µ1, ..., µn-1}. By Corollary 2.1.2, µj = -µn-j  Q for all j = 0, ..., n - 1, where

µj = i wnjk - i wn-jk, for 0  j  n - 1.

kC

kC

Hence wnj is a root of polynomial p(x) = i xk - i x-k - µj  Q(i)[x]. Since n  0 (mod 4),

kC

kC

the polynomial n(x) is irreducible in Q(i)[x]. Therefore, p(x) is a multiple of the irreducible

polynomial n(x), and so wn-j = wnn-j is also a root of p(x), i.e. µj = µn-j. Now µj = µn-j and

µj = -µn-j implies that µj = µn-j = 0, for all j = 0, ..., n - 1. Hence C = . Converse part is easy

to prove.

(ii) We have already the proved sufficient part in Corollary 3.5.1. Assume that G is an integral oriented

circulant graph with non-empty symbol set C. Let u be the vector of length n - 1 defined by



 

1





uk = -1



  

0

if k  C if n - k  C otherwise.

Note that each entry of Eu is an eigenvalue of G, and so Eu  Zn-1. Therefore u  U, and by

Theorem

5.2,

u

d

|

n 4

}.

That

is,

u=

d|

n 4

cdu(d),

where

cd

Q

for

d|

n 4

.

Note that coordinates of u and u(d) belong to {0, ±1}. Since Gn(d1)  Gn(d2) =  for all d1 = d2,

so

uk

=

cdu(d)k

for

all

k



Gn(d)

implies

that

cd

 {0, ±1}

for

all

d|

n 4

.

Let

D

be

the

set

of

all

d

for

which

cd

=

0

and

d

|

n 4

.

Thus

C

=

Sn(d), where Sn(d) = G1n(d) or Sn(d) = G3n(d).

Theorem 5.4. Let G = Circ(Zn, C) be mixed circulant graph on n vertices with symbol set C. Then G

Proof. By Theorem 2.5, G is integral if and only if both (Zn, C \ C) and (Zn, C) are integral. Therefore the result follows from Theorem 2.4 and Theorem 5.3.

Wasin So [25] gave an upper bound on the number of integral circulant graphs on n vertices.

14

Corollary 5.4.1. [25] Let  (n) be the number of divisors of n. Then there are at most 2(n)-1 integral mixed circulant graphs on n vertices.

In the next result, we give a similar upper bound on the number of integral mixed circulant graphs on n vertices.

Corollary 5.4.2. Let  (n) be the number of divisors of n. Then there are at most k(n) integral mixed circulant graphs on n vertices, where





2

(

n 4

)+

(n)-1

k(n) =

 2 (n)-1

if n  0 (mod 4) if n  0 (mod 4).

Proof. If n  0 (mod 4) then Theorem 5.4 says that every integral mixed circulant graph is integral. By

Corollary 5.4.1, there are at most 2(n)-1 integral mixed circulant graphs on n vertices. Assume that

n  0 (mod 4) and Circ(Zn, C) is a mixed circulant graph on n vertices with symbol set C. For every

divisor

d

of

n 4

,

by

Theorem

5.4,

Gn(d),

G1n(d),

G3n(d)

and



are

subsets

of

the

symbol

Thus,

we

have

4

(

n 4

)

distinct

symbol

sets

for

an

integral

graph

corresponding

to

divisors

of

For

a

divisor

by

Theorem

Gn(d)

Thus,

we

have

(

n 4

)-1

distinct

symbol

sets

for

an

integral

mixed

graph

corresponding

to proper divisors of n which are not divisors of

Hence

we

)

(n)-

(

=

(

n 4

(n)-1

distinct symbol sets for an integral mixed circulant graph. Since distinct symbol sets may correspond

so

there

6 Ramanujan sum and eigenvalues of oriented circulant graph

In 1918, Ramanujan [24] published a seminal paper in which he introduced a sum (now called Ramanujan sums), for each n, q  N, defined by

cn(q) =

cos

2aq n

.

(5)

aGn(1)

This sum can also be written as

cn(q) =

wnaq =

2 cos

2aq n

,

aGn(1)

aGn(1)

a<

n 2

where

wn

=

exp(

2i n

).

A

set

C

 Gn(1)

is

said

to

be

skew-symmetric

in

Gn(1)

if

n-a  S

for

all

a

S

and

C

 C-1

=

Gn(1).

It

is

clear

that

a

skew-symmetric

set

in

Gn(1)

contains

exactly

(n) 2

elements.

15

It is easy to see, for any skew-symmetric set C in Gn(1), that the Ramanujan sum (5) can be re-written as

cn(q) =

2 cos

2aq n

.

(6)

aC

One of the important properties of Ramanujan sum is that cn(q) is an integer for all q, n  N. So, it is a natural question to ask, "if we replace cosine with sine in Ramanujan sum, then is the sum remain

an integer or not for all q, n  N?". Let us replace the cosine by sine in (6), and write

sCn(q) =

2 sin

2aq n

,

(7)

aC

where C is any skew-symmetric set in Gn(1). The sum (7) can be re-written as

sCn(q) =

wnaq

- wn-aq i

.

(8)

aC

Theorem 6.1. The following are true.

(i) For n  0 (mod 4), there does not exist skew-symmetric set C in Gn(1) such that sCn(q)  Z for all q, n  N.

(ii) For n  0 (mod 4), sCn(q)  Z for all q, n  N if and only if C = G1n(1) or G3n(1).
The proof of Theorem 6.1 follows from Theorem 5.3. In what follows, we consider C = G1n(1) for the sum in (7) and (8), and we simply write sCn(q) by sn(q). That is,

sn(q) =

wnaq

- wn-aq i

.

aG1n(1)

In Theorem 6.1, we found that sn(q) is integer for all n, q  N and n  (0 mod 4).

Theorem 6.2. [25] Let G = Circ(Zn, C) be an integral circulant graph on n vertices with SpH(G) = {0, ..., n-1}. Let C = Gn(d), where d | n. Then

j = cn/d(j), for 0  j  n - 1.

Furthermore, SpH(G) is equal to d copies of (cn/d(0), cn/d(1), ..., cn/d((n/d) - 1)).

Theorem 6.3. Let G = Circ(Zn, C) be an integral oriented circulant graph on n  0 (mod 4) vertices

with

SpH (G) = {µ0, ..., µn-1}.

Let

C

= G1n(d),

where

d|

n 4

.

Then

µj = -sn/d(j), for 0  j  n - 1.

Furthermore, SpH(G) is equal to d copies of (-sn/d(0), -sn/d(1), ..., -sn/d((n/d) - 1)).

the

Corollary 6.3.1. Let G = Circ(Zn, C) be an integral oriented circulant graph on n  0 (mod 4) vertices

with SpH (G) = {µ0, ..., µn-1}. Then

From Theorem 6.3, it is clear that sn(q) play an important role in the eigenvalues of integral mixed circulant graph. In the next result we see some basic properties of sn(q).

Theorem 6.4. The following are some basic properties of sn(q).

(i) sn(t1) = sn(t2) for t1  t2 (mod n).

aMn1 (1)

(wnt

As sn(t) is a sum of a geometric progression with common ratio -wn2t, now it follows the required result.

form n = ab (a  P, b  Q), then each of the sets P and Q is called a direct factor set of N. In what

follows P will denote such a direct factor set with (conjugate) factor set Q. The Mo¨bius function can be

generalized to arbitrary direct factor sets, by writing

µP (n) =

µ

n d

,

d|n,dP

where µ is the classical Mo¨bius function. For example, µ1(n) = µ{1}(n) and µN(n) = (n).

Theorem 6.7. [12]

= (n).

d|n,dQ

Theorem 6.8. [12] If f (n) and g(n) are arithmetic functions then

f (n) =

g

n d

if and only if g(n) =

f (d)µP

n d

.

d|n,dQ

d|n

Let us now take the direct factor P = {2k : k  0}, and Q the set of all odd natural numbers.
