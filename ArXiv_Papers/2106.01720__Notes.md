## Abstract

In this paper we discuss a hybridised method for FEM-BEM coupling. The coupling from both sides use a Nitsche type approach to couple to the trace variable. This leads to a formulation that is robust and flexible with respect to approximation spaces and can easily be combined as a building block with other hybridised methods. Energy error norm estimates and the convergence of Jacobi iterations are proved and the performance of the method is illustrated on some computational examples.
