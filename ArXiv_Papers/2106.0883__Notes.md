## Abstract

Proteinoids -- thermal proteins -- are produced by heating amino acids to their melting point and initiation of polymerisation to produce polymeric chains. Proteinoids swell in aqueous solution into hollow microspheres. The proteinoid microspheres produce endogenous burst of electrical potential spikes and change patterns of their electrical activity in response to illumination. The microspheres can interconnect by pores and tubes and form networks with a programmable growth. We speculate on how ensembles of the proteinoid microspheres can be developed into unconventional computing devices.
