The exact eigenenergies of the T4c = [cc][c¯c¯], T4b = [bb][¯b¯b], and T2[bc] = [bc][¯bc¯] tetraquarks are calculated within the extended transitional Hamiltonian approach, in which the so-called Bethe ansatz within an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra is used. We fit the parameters appearing in the transitional region from phenomenology associated with potential candidates of tetraquarks. The rotation and vibration transitional theory seems to provide a better description of heavy tetraquarks than other attempts within the same formalism. Our results indicate that the pairing strengths are large enough to provide binding; an extended comparison with the current literature is also performed.

I. INTRODUCTION
A system of interacting bosons is a well-studied problem. Having its roots in the Bose-Einstein condensates [1­3], the framework has been applied to studies of nuclear and molecular structure [4­6], and examples of algebraic methods applied to hadron physics can be found in Refs. [7­11]. We have recently applied the interacting boson approximation proposed by Arima and Iachello [12], which includes two types of bosons (s and d -bosons), to the computation of wave functions in an interacting sl many-body boson system [13].
Quarks can combine to form hadrons such as mesons (quark-antiquark pair) and baryon (threequarks). Within an algebraic framework, the spectrum of hadrons began to be studied with the seminal work of Iachello in 1989 [7]. He was also able to elucidate some features about the structure of mesons and baryons, and the emergence of general patterns. An extension of the interacting boson approximation for studying eigenenergies of mesons in the U (4) model was proposed by et al. in 2006 [14]. The mass spectra of QQ¯ mesons, with Q either c or b quark, has been recently discussed by the U (3)  O(4) transitional theory [7, 8, 14]. Herein, we want to extend this model to multi-quark states [15], in particular, tetraquarks with only heavy-quark content. In an extension of the sl boson system, the largest dynamical symmetry group is generated by s and l (l = Q, Q¯, . . .) boson operators. We examine a similar Hamiltonian, based on SU (1, 1) algebraic technique [13, 29­31] and in a sl boson system to describe the masses of the [QQ][Q¯Q¯] tetraquarks. Our predictions will provide a new solvable model in hadron physics. We shall show that the masses of the [QQ][Q¯Q¯] tetraquarks are sensible to the vector quark pairing strengths.

Fully-heavy tetraquarks have recently received considerable attention, both experimentally and theoretically. On the experimental side, it is thought that all-heavy tetraquark states will be very easy to spot because their masses should be far away from the typical mass regions populated by both conventional heavy mesons and the XYZ states discovered until now [32]. A search for deeply bound bb¯b¯b tetraquark states at the LHC was motivated by Eichten et al. in Ref. [33], and it was carried out by the LHCb collaboration [34] determining that no significant excess is found in the µ+µ-(1S) invariant-mass distribution. Note, however, that a search for exotic mesons at the CMS experiment reported a potential candidate of a fully bottom tetraquark T4b = [bb][¯b¯b] around 18-19 GeV [35]. On the other hand, the LHCb collaboration has recently released in Ref. [36] a study of the J/-pair invariant mass spectrum finding a narrow peak and a broad structure which could originate from hadron states consisting of four charm quarks.
From the theoretical side, we find fully-heavy tetraquark computations based on phenomenological mass formulae [37­39], QCD sum rules [40­43], QCD motivated bag models [44], NR effective field theories [45, 46], potential models [47­60], non-perturbative functional methods [61], and even some exploratory lattice-QCD calculations [62]. Some works predict the existence of stable QQQ¯Q¯ (Q = c or b) bound states with masses slightly lower than the respective thresholds of quarkonium pairs (see, for instance, Refs. [37, 38, 40­ 42, 45, 46, 54]. In contrast, there are other studies that predict no stable ccc¯c¯ and bb¯b¯b tetraquark bound states because their masses are larger than two-quarkonium thresholds (see, e.g., Refs. [39, 47, 49, 51, 62]). To some extent, a better understanding of the mass locations of fully-heavy tetraquark states would be desirable, if not crucial, for our comprehension of their underlying dynamics and their experimental hunting.

II. THEORETICAL METHOD

Within this framework, diquark clusters must be assumed in order to describe a tetraquark system. According to this, a tetraquark

T = Q1Q2Q¯3Q¯4 ,

(1)

contains two point-like diquarks and we extend the interacting boson model to multi-level pairing considering algebraic solutions of an sl-boson system [13]. Note that the dynamical symmetry group is generated by s and l operators, where l can be the configuration of the multiquark states. In the Vibron Model, elementary spatial excitations are scalar s-bosons with spin and parity l = 0+ and vector l-bosons with spin and parity l = 1-. In the finite-dimensional SU (1, 1) algebra, we have the generators, which satisfies the following commutation relations

[Q0(l), Q±(l)] = ±Q±(l) ,

(2a)

[Q+(l), Q-(l)] = -2Q0(l).

(2b)

Now, we apply the affine SU (1, 1) algebra for Us(1)  UQ1Q2 (3)  UQ¯3Q¯4 (3)  UJ (3) - SO(10) transitional Hamiltonian. It is important to note that Q1Q2Q¯3Q¯4 responds, respectively, to T4c = [cc][c¯c¯], T4b = [bb][¯b¯b] and T2bc = [bc][¯bc¯] systems; and also that the quasi-spin algebras have been explained in detail in Refs. [13, 29­
31].
By using Eqs. (2a) and (2b) as generators of the SU l(1, 1)-algebra for tetraquarks, we have

Q+(l) = 1 l · l ,

(3a)

2

Q-(l) = 1 ~l · ~l ,

(3b)

2

Q0(l) = 1 l · ~l + 2l + 1 ,

(3c)

2

2

where l is the creation operator of an l -boson constituying the tetraquark, and ~l = (-1) l- .
It is accepted that the basis vectors of U (2l + 1) 
SO(2l + 1) and O(2l + 2)  O(2l + 1) are simultaneously the basis vectors of SU (1, 1)l  U (1)ls and SU (1, 1)sl  U (1)ssl, respectively. Their complementary relation for tetraquark states can be expressed as

|Q1, Q2, Q¯3,Q¯4, N ; nl l , nJ M = = |Q1, Q2, Q¯3, Q¯4, N ; l µl , nJ M , (4)

and

where N , nl, l, J and M are quantum numbers of U (N ),

U (2l + 1), SO(2l + 1), SO(3) and SO(2), respectively.

The quantum number n is an additional one needed to

distinguish different states with the same J. However,

the pairing models of multi-level are also characterized

by an overlaid U (n1 + n2 + . . .) algebraic structure which

has been described in detail in, for istance, Refs. [13, 14, 30, 31]. This is to say either

Affine Lie algebras are famous among the infinitedimensional Lie algebras and have widespread applications because of their representation theory. We know that affine Lie algebra is far richer than that of finitedimensional simple Lie algebras. Hence, in contrast to Eqs. (2a) and (2b), the operators under the corresponding SU (1, 1) irreducible representations satisfy the following commutation relations:

[Q0m(l), Q±n (l)] = ±Q±m+n(l) , [Q+m(l), Q-n (l)] = -2Q0m+n+1(l).

(7a) (7b)

According to the definitions, Qm, with  = 0, ± and m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . generate the affine Lie algebra with-
out central extension. The infinite dimensional SU (1, 1) Lie algebra defined by

Q±n = c2Qn1+1Q±(Q1) + c2Qn2+1Q±(Q2) + c2Q¯n3+1Q±(Q¯3)

+ c2Q¯n4+1Q±(Q¯4),

(8a)

Q0n = c2Qn1 Q0(Q1) + c2Qn2 Q0(Q2) + c2Q¯n3 Q0(Q¯3)

+ c2Q¯n4 Q0(Q¯4) ,

(8b)

where cQ's are real-valued control parameters for tetraquarks, and n can be taken to be 1, 2, 3, . . .
The lowest weight state of fully-heavy tetraquarks should satisfy Q-(l)|lw = 0. Then, we define |lw by
the following expression:

|lw = |Q1, Q2, Q¯3, Q¯4, N ; l µl, nJ M ,

(9)

where N = 2k + Q1 + Q2 + Q¯3 + Q¯4 . Hence, we have

Q0n|lw = ln|lw , ln =

c2l n

2l + 1 nl + 2

It is apparent that the system is in the vibrational U (9)
and rotational SO(10) transition region as the pairing
strengths, cl, vary continuously within the closed interval [0, cl]. The quantum phase transition occurs in the all-heavy tetraquark pairing model. The U (9) limit is ful-
filled by cQ1 = cQ2 = cQ¯3 = cQ¯4 = 0 where as the SO(10) limit occurs when cQ1 = cQ2 = cQ¯3 = cQ¯4 = 1. In our calculation, we have extracted different values for the
control parameters between U (9) and SO(10) limits, viz.
cQi  [0, 1] with i = 1, . . . , 4.

The total Hamiltonian is represented in terms of the Casimir operators C^2 by branching chains. The two first terms of the Hamiltonian, Q+0 Q-0 and Q01, are related to SU (1, 1) algebra and the remaining ones are constant according to Casimirs. In duality relation for tetraquarks, the irreducible representations reduce the quasi-spin algebra chains (8a) and (8b) as well, and the labels for the chains are connected through the duality relations. By employing the generators of algebra SU (1, 1), the proposed Hamiltonian for heavy tetraquark pairing model is

H^ = g Q+0 Q-0 +  Q01 +  C^2(SO(9))

+ 1 C^2(SO(3)s) + 2 C^2(SO(3)Q1Q2 )

+ 3 C^2(SO(3)Q¯3 Q¯4 ) +  C^2(SO(3)J ),

(11)

where g, , , 1, 2, 3, and  are real-valued parameters.
To find the non-zero energy eigenstates with k-pairs, we exploit a Fourier Laurent expansion of the eigenstates of Hamiltonians which contain dependences on several quantities in terms of unknown c-number parameters xi, and thus eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian for excitations can be written as

|k; Q1 Q2 Q¯3 Q¯4 nJ M =

A similar structure to Eq. (13) was first used by Gaudin [63] as a guess in obtaining exact solutions of interaction systems, which is now confirmed to be a consistent operator form in composing the Bethe ansatz wave function, Eq. (12) for the current tetraquark system.
Our formalism and methods for masses of heavy tetraquarks are the same as the procedure in Ref. [14, 30, 31]. The representation (11) is totally symmetric, corresponding to the fact that the excitations (vibrations and rotations) are bosonic in nature. So, we have to define the number of bosons in our system. Here the boson number value depicts the total number of vibrational states in the representation [N ].
The quantum phase transition occurs between vibrational and rotational limits in the full heavy tetraquark pairing model. The quark (antiquark) configuration can

perform vibrations and rotations (Fig. 1) defined by the quantum numbers Qi , Q¯i and J . We do not study here bending and twisting of tetraquarks since these are required to lie at higher masses. The pure configuration problem of Fig. 1 is slightly complicated by the fact that quarks and antiquarks have internal degrees of freedom. Here we apply the solvable model to consider both geometric and internal excitations of the tetraquark masses. Our formalism and methods for masses of heavy tetraquarks are the same as the procedure in Ref. [14].

III. RESULTS

In the diquark­anti-diquark pairing model, the
tetraquark mass can be determined by solving the eigen-
value problem of Eq. (11). Moreover, the quantum num-
bers that define a tetraquark state are the spins of di-
quark and antidiquark clusters, and the total spin, spa-
tial inversion symmetry and charge conjugation of the system, i.e. the JP C quantum numbers. Following Ref. [64], for a Q1Q2Q¯3Q¯4 system, the quantum labels are J P C =0++, 1+- and 2++, and thus we have:

1. Two states for the scalar system:

|0++ = |0Q1Q2 , 0Q¯3Q¯4 ; J = 0 , |0++ = |1Q1Q2 , 1Q¯3Q¯4 ; J = 0 .

(15a) (15b)

2. Three states for the vector system:

|A = |0Q1Q2 , 1Q¯3Q¯4 ; J = 1 , |B = |1Q1Q2 , 0Q¯3Q¯4 ; J = 1 , |C = |1Q1Q2 , 1Q¯3Q¯4 ; J = 1 .

(16a) (16b) (16c)

Under charge conjugation, we have different configurations in which |A and |B interchange while

4

|C is odd. Thus, the JP = 1+ involves one C-even and two C-odd states:

|1++ = 1 (|A + |B ) , 2

|1+-

1 =

(|A

- |B ) ,

2

|1+- = |C .

(17a) (17b) (17c)

Note here that we must select the appropriate values for the spin of Q1Q¯3 and Q2Q¯4. This means that the only state with C = + is that in which Q1Q¯3 has spin SQ1Q¯3 = 1.
3. One state for the tensor system:

|2++ = |1Q1Q2 , 1Q¯3Q¯4 ; J = 2 , where this state has also SQ1Q¯3 = 1.

(18)

A. The [cc][c¯c¯] system
In the pairing tetraquark model, the rigid and nonrigid phases correspond, respectively, to the SO(10) and U (9) symmetry cases. Both are idealized situations and must coexist in real world. Therefore, the U (9)  SO(10) transitional region is where the two phases coexist and vibrational-rotational modes appear.
The parameters in the transitional region are called the phase parameters since the cQi = 1, with i = 1, . . . , 4, case corresponds to the rotational mode, while the cQi = 0 case corresponds to the vibrational mode. We first can calculate the mass spectrum of the pairing tetraquark model with fixed phase parameters. Then, the transitional spectra from one phase to the other can be obtained modifying the phase parameters within the closed interval [0, 1].
From a transitional theory point of view, the ideal way of extracting the values of the phase coefficients is looking at the meson-meson thresholds c(1S)c(1S) and J/(1S)J/(1S) for JP C = 0++, c(1S)J/(1S) for J P C = 1+-, and J/(1S)J/(1S) for J P C = 2++. Our values are cQ1 = 0.92, cQ2 = 1, and cQ¯3 = cQ¯4 = 0, which results into the following masses
|0++ = |1cc, 1c¯c¯; J = 0 : M = 5.978 GeV , (19) |1+- = |1cc, 1c¯c¯; J = 1 : M = 6.155 GeV , (20) |2++ = |1cc, 1c¯c¯; J = 2 : M = 6.263 GeV , (21)
for the T4c tetraquark system.

B. The [bb][¯b¯b] system
The situation here is very similar with respect the case above. This time, from a transitional theory point of view, the extraction phase coefficients must be performed

attending to the meson-meson thresholds b(1S)b(1S) and (1S)(1S) for J P C = 0++, b(1S)(1S) for J P C = 1+-, and (1S)(1S) for J P C = 2++. Our numerical values are cQ1 = 0.97, cQ2 = 1, cQ¯3 = 1 and cQ¯4 = 0, which provide the following masses:
|0++ = |1bb, 1¯b¯b; J = 0 : M = 18.752 GeV , (22) |1+- = |1bb, 1¯b¯b; J = 1 : M = 18.805 GeV , (23) |2++ = |1bb, 1¯b¯b; J = 2 : M = 18.920 GeV , (24)
for the T4b tetraquark system.

C. The [bc][¯bc¯] system

The final structure analyzed in this work is the T2bc = [bc][¯bc¯] tetraquark system. In this case, the [bc] diquark spin can be either 0 or 1 and thus all states analyzed at the beginning of this section are possible. Again, from a transitional theory point of view, the best extraction procedure of the control parameters in the T2bc tetraquarks are the corresponding meson-meson families which deliver the following values: cQ1 = cQ2 = 1, and cQ¯3 = cQ¯4 = 0. The masses computed in this case can be classified as follows:
(i) The JP C = 0++ contains two scalar states with masses
|0++ = |0bc, 0¯bc¯; J = 0 : M = 12.359 GeV , (25) |0++ = |1bc, 1¯bc¯; J = 0 : M = 12.503 GeV . (26)

(ii) The JP C = 1+- contains two states with masses

|1+- = |1bc, 1¯bc¯; J = 1 : M = 12.016 GeV . (28)

(iii) The JP C = 1++ contains one state with mass

(iv) The JP C = 2++ contains one state with mass |2++ = |1bc, 1¯bc¯; J = 2 : M = 12.897 GeV . (30)

IV. DISCUSSION
In the calculation procedure, we fix the Hamiltonian parameters and allow the phase parameters to vary during the transition. In Ref. [8] we showed that the quantum number of the amount of bosons can be taken in the

FIG. 2. The resulting parameters of the Hamiltonian when predicting the tetraquark masses based on the diquarkantidiquark pairing model. In the calculation, the effective g-factor is taken to be 1.
N   limit. Moreover, it was adequate to take N large

enough to cover all known and unknown states up to a maximum value of the quantum number of the angular momentum, and other quantum numbers connected with applications. In the present investigation, we take this to be the same as that used in Ref. [8] with N = 100.
The trend of Hamiltonian is similar to that of the O(4) limit condition proposed in mesons when the control parameter is taken to be 1. Most importantly, our investigation shows that the control parameters cQ¯3 and cQ¯4 cannot be taken to be 1 when heavy antiquarks are involved except for T4b tetraquarks. This is because the masses of T4b tetraquarks are 2 - 3 times heavier than T2bc and T4c ones. In this condition for heavy mass tetraquarks, the effect of pairing strength is strong, which can be seen in the fact that cQ1 for T2bc is larger than in the T4c case.
The values of the parameters in Hamiltonian for the mentioned structures are given in Figure 2. In the transition region,  is taken to be 1.5. Since the vibrationalrotational transition within the pairing model is a secondorder quantum phase transition, the masses wave functions in the U (9) model of studied tetraquarks behave smoothly with respect changes in the parameters, which allows us to fix them in the transition region.
Table I shows the difference between the calculated

tetraquark masses and meson-pair threshold. We present the values of  = Mtetra - Eth, where Mtetra and Eth are the tetraquark mass and its lowest meson-meson threshold, respectively. A negative  indicates that the tetraquark state lies below the threshold of the fall-apart decay into two mesons and consequently should be stable. Besides, a state with a small positive value for the  could also be observed as a resonance since the phase space would suppress its partial decay width. The remaining states, with large positive  values, are supposed to be broad and challenging to recognize in experimental analyses.
Our analysis confirms that the control parameter cQ1 deviating a little from 1 appears better in the extraction

of the tetraquark masses, specially for comprehensive T2bc families. One can also see that, in the T4b = [bb][¯b¯b] states, the higher contribution comes from the pairing of cQ¯3 and cQ¯4 quarks. This means that at high energy, around 18 - 19 GeV, phase parameters for Q¯3 and Q¯4 quarks begin to play an essential role in computing tetraquark masses; while in the low energy regime, there is a competition between the Q1 and Q2.
According to the above definition, it can be claimed that the energy spectra of the studied fully-heavy tetraquarks in which cQi  0.9 - 1.0 corresponds to a rotational phase. Note also that a change of ±15% in all coefficients produce a maximum variation of 30%, 23%, 17% in a particular channel's mass of T4c, T4b and T2bc

tetraquark systems, respectively; having that all remaining masses experience lesser modifications.
Finally, the results obtain herein with the pairing model are compared with the prediction of previous theoretical calculations in Tables II and III. One can deduce that the theory fairly reproduces the other works, indicating that our solvable model could still play an essential role in the prediction of fully-heavy tetraquark mesons. In order to do so, a possible improvement is to include the large-N limit of the pure pairing Hamiltonian to gain a better understanding of the multiquark dynamics.
V. SUMMARY
Inspired by the problem of solving the interacting slboson system in the transitional region, the solvable extended Hamiltonian that includes multi-pair interactions has been considered to provide the mass spectra of fully-heavy tetraquarks. Numerical extractions of T4c, T4b, and T2bc ground state masses, within the algebraic model in which the Bethe ansatz is adopted, were carried out to test the theory. The results reveal that the U (9)  SO(10) Hamiltonian could predict spectra in fair

agreement with other theoretical approaches. Finally, the solvable technique introduced in this
manuscript may also be helpful in diagonalizing more general multiquark systems, which will be considered in future work.
