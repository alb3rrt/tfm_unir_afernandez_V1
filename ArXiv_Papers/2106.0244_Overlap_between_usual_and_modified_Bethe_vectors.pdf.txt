Abstract We consider the overlap of Bethe vectors of the XXX spin chain with a diagonal twist and the modified Bethe vectors with a general twist. We find a determinant representation for this overlap under one additional condition on the twist parameters. Such objects arise in the calculations of nonequilibrium physics.
1 Introduction
Integrable quantum spin chains are a powerful tool for studying nonequilibrium physics. They have parameters that can be considered time-dependent. A simple example is an external magnetic field given by a Heaviside function that turns the field on or off. One can also consider the change in the parameters that define the boundary conditions. For example, a chain of N spins can be closed periodically or in the form of the M¨obius strip. In the general case, the classification of integrable boundary parameters follows from the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method and related quantum algebras. In particular, the twisting of isotropic closed spin chains is given by an arbitrary invertible matrix.
To study the behavior of quantum integrable models when the boundary conditions change, we should solve the eigenproblem for any integrable boundary parameters and calculate the overlap between the states corresponding to different values of these parameters. For this, we use the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method [1­3]. In this method, the eigenvectors of quantum Hamiltonians are constructed using the algebraic Bethe ansatz, and the roots of the Bethe equations parameterize the spectrum. A modified version of the Bethe ansatz is needed in the case of so-called "off-diagonal boundaries" [4]. The spectrum of such models is given by

modified Bethe equations, which contain the inhomogeneous term [5, 6]. In this case, there is an additional restriction on the number of Bethe equations.
In a recent series of papers, we studied the scalar products of modified Bethe vectors [7­ 9]. We found that the well-known formulas of the standard algebraic Bethe ansatz smoothly transform into a modified form that has the same structure. This applies both to scalar products of vectors of a general form [12] and to scalar products containing the eigenvectors of a modified transfer matrix [10­13]. In this paper, we consider the overlap (scalar product) of two vectors corresponding to different transfer matrices. One of the vectors corresponds to a transfer matrix with a diagonal twist. It can be constructed within the framework of the standard algebraic Bethe ansatz. The second vector is a modified Bethe vector, which corresponds to a transfer matrix with a twist of the general form. To construct this vector, one needs to use the modified Bethe ansatz. We show that when one additional condition is imposed on the twist parameters, such an overlap has a compact determinant representation. This opens a possibility to calculate quenches in the XXX chains of an arbitrary spin.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we recall basic notions of the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method. Here we also introduce a special notation used below. In section 3, we introduce a modified transfer matrix and construct modified Bethe vectors. Section 4 is devoted to a modified Izergin determinant [7]. Here we derive a new representation which contains a set of arbitrary complex numbers. In section 5, we consider the overlap between Bethe vectors with diagonal twist and modified Bethe vectors of general type. We show that under one additional constraint between the twist parameters, this overlap has a determinant representation. Appendix A contains some auxiliary formulas for the modified Izergin determinant and proof of some propositions used in the calculation.

2 Quantum inverse scattering method

To formulate the problem within the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method framework, we con-

sider a monodromy matrix

T (u) =

t11(u) t21(u)

t12(u) t22(u)

.

(2.1)

The matrix elements tkl(u) act in a Hilbert space H and depend on a complex parameter u. The commutation relations between tkl(u) are defined by an RTT-relation

R12(u - v)T1(u)T2(v) = T2(v)T1(u)R12(u - v).

(2.2)

Here T1(u) = T (u)  1 and T2(u) = 1  T (u), where 1 is the identity matrix in C2. The R-matrix R12(u) acts in C2  C2 and has the form

R(u)

=

u c

(1



1)

+

P.

(2.3)

Here P the permutation operator such that P xy = y x for any x, y  C2, and c is a constant. The R-matrix (2.3) has the following property:

[R12(u - v), K1K2] = 0,

(2.4)

2

for any 2 × 2 matrix K. This property leads to the fact that a matrix KT (u) satisfies the

RTT-relation (2.2).

The trace of the monodromy matrix tr T (u) = t11(u) + t22(u) is called a transfer matrix.

Due to the RTT-relation (2.2),

[tr T (u), tr T (v)] = 0,

(2.5)

for any complex u and v. This property of the transfer matrix allows us to consider it as a generating function of the integrals of motion of a quantum model. Due to the cyclicity of the trace, this model has periodic boundary conditions. The trace of the twisted monodromy matrix tr(KT (u)) can also be used to generate integrals of motion. However, they satisfy boundary conditions of a more general form.
Let us define a highest weight representation by V (1(u), 2(u)), where i(u) are some complex valued functions, and the highest weight vector |0  H is defined by

tii(u)|0 = i(u)|0 , t21(u)|0 = 0.

(2.6)

The action of the operator t12(u) on |0 is free. A state obtained by the successive action of the t12 operators on the highest weight vector is called a Bethe vector

|(u¯) = t12(u1) . . . t12(un)|0 .

(2.7)

Here n = 0, 1, . . . , and u¯ = {u1, . . . , un}. If the parameters u¯ are generic complex numbers, then |(u¯) is called the off-shell Bethe vector. Under certain constraint on the parameters u¯
(see section 3), the vector (2.7) becomes an eigenvector of the transfer matrix. Then it is called
the on-shell Bethe vector. To study scalar products we also introduce a dual vector 0|  H defined by

0|tii(u) = i(u) 0|,

0|t12(u) = 0,

(2.8)

and a condition 0|0 = 1. The functions i(u) are the same as in (2.6). Dual Bethe vectors are constructed by successive action of the t21 operators on 0|:

(u¯)| = 0|t21(u1) . . . t21(un).

(2.9)

2.1 Notation

To simplify formulas, we introduce three rational functions

g(u, v)

=

u

c -

v,

f (u, v)

=

1

+

g(u, v)

=

u

-v+ u-v

c,

h(u, v)

=

f (u, v) g(u, v)

=

u

-

v c

+

c

,

(2.10)

where c is the constant entering the R-matrix. It is easy to see that the functions (2.10) have the following properties:

(u, v)

= (v, u),

c-c

(-u, -v) = (v, u),

(u - c, v) = (u, v + c),

(2.11)

3

where  is any of the three functions. Besides, we have

g(u, v

-

c)

=

1 h(u,

v)

,

h(u, v

+ c)

=

1 g(u,

v)

,

f (u, v

+ c)

=

f

1 (v,

u)

.

(2.12)

Below we deal with sets of complex parameters. We denote them by a bar (see, e.g., (2.7)), for example, u¯ = {u1, . . . , un}. Notation u¯ ± c means that ±c is added to all the arguments of the set u¯. The notation u¯k refers to the subset u¯k = u¯ \ uk.
To make the formulas more compact, we use a shorthand notation for the products of the
rational functions (2.10), the operators tkl(u) (2.1), and their vacuum eigenvalues i(u) (2.6). Namely, if the function (operator) depends on a set of variables, then this means the product over the corresponding set. For example, if u¯ = {u1, . . . , un}, then

n

n

n

n

tkl(u¯) = tkl(uj), i(u¯) = i(uj), f (z, u¯) = f (z, uj), f (u¯k, uk) = f (uj, uk),

j=1

j=1

j=1

j=1

j=k

(2.13)

and so on. Note that the RTT-relation (2.2) implies [tkl(u), tkl(v)] = 0. Thus, the first product

in (2.13) is well defined. Later we will extend this convention to the products of matrix elements

of the twisted monodromy matrix.

Notation f (u¯, v¯) means the double product over the sets u¯ and v¯. By definition, any product

over the empty set is equal to 1. A double product is equal to 1 if at least one of the sets is

empty.

Finally, for any set of complex parameters u¯ = {u1, . . . , un} such that n  2, we also

introduce special products of the g-functions

(u¯) =

g(uj , uk),

1k<jn

(u¯) =

g(uk, uj).

1k<jn

(2.14)

It is easy to see that (u¯) = (-1)n(n-1)/2(u¯). For n = 0, 1, we set (u¯) = (u¯) = 1 by definition.

3 Twisted monodromy matrix

We consider two twisted monodromy matrices K()T (u),  = 1, 2. The first one corresponds to the twist matrix K(1) = diag(1, ), where  is a complex
parameter. Then the twisted transfer matrix has the form

t(1)(u) = t11(u) + t22(u).

(3.1)

We call it a diagonal transfer matrix. It generates a model with quasi-periodic boundary conditions. The eigenvectors (resp. dual eigenvectors) of the diagonal transfer matrix have the form (2.7) (resp. (2.9))

|(1)(u¯) = t12(u¯)|0 ,

(1)(u¯)| = 0|t21(u¯).

(3.2)

4

We have added an extra superscript to the vectors to emphasize that they refer to the transfer matrix t(1)(u).
If the parameters u¯ = {u1, . . . , un} are arbitrary complex numbers, then the vectors (3.2) are off-shell. If these parameters satisfy twisted Bethe equations

then

1(uj)f (u¯j, uj) = 2(uj)f (uj, u¯j), j = 1, . . . , n,

t(1)(v)|(1)(u¯) = (1)(v|u¯)|(1)(u¯) ,

(1)(u¯)|t(1)(v) = (1)(v|u¯) (1)(u¯)|,

(3.3) (3.4)

where

(1)(v|u¯) = 1(v)f (u¯, v) + 2(v)f (v, u¯).

(3.5)

The vectors |(1)(u¯) and (1)(u¯)| are called on-shell provided the conditions (3.3) are fulfilled. In the case of the XXX spin-1/2 chain, the number of parameters {u1, . . . , un} does not exceed the length of the chain.
The second deformation corresponds to the twist matrix of the general form

K(2) =

~ -

+ 

,

(3.6)

where the entries of K(2) are arbitrary complex numbers. This twist produces models with non-
diagonal boundary conditions. The standard procedure of the algebraic Bethe ansatz should be modified in this case [8, 14]. We present the twist matrix in the form K(2) = BDA where

A = µ

and the parameters  satisfy the following condition:

(3.8)

12 - (1 + ~2) + +- = 0.

(3.9)

Then a twisted transfer matrix is defined as follows: t(2)(u) = tr(K(2)T (u)) = tr(DT (u)).

(3.10)

Here T (u) is a modified monodromy matrix

T (u) = AT (u)B =

11(u) 21(u)

12(u) 22(u)

.

(3.11)

The entries of T (u) have the following expressions in terms of the initial monodromy matrix elements:

(3.12) (3.13) (3.14) (3.15)

The modified Bethe vectors (resp. the dual modified Bethe vectors) related to the twisted transfer matrix (3.10) can be constructed from the new entries 12(z) (resp. 21(z)). They are given by

|(2)(u¯) = 12(u¯)|0 ,

(2)(u¯)| = 0|21(u¯).

(3.16)

Here we have used the convention on the shorthand notation for the products of the operators
ij (u). If u¯ = {u1, . . . , uN } is a set of arbitrary complex numbers, then vectors (3.16) are off-shell.
However, if the set u¯ satisfies inhomogeneous Bethe equations

(~ - 1)1(uj)f (u¯j, uj) = ( - 2)2(uj)f (uj, u¯j) + (1 + 2)1(uj)2(uj)g(uj, u¯j), (3.17)

for j = 1, . . . , N , then they are eigenvectors of the twisted transfer matrix (3.10)

t(2)(v)|(2)(u¯) = (2)(v|u¯)|(2)(u¯) ,

(2)(u¯)|t(2)(v) = (2)(v|u¯) (2)(u¯)|,

(3.18)

with an eigenvalue

(2)(v|u¯) = (~ - 1)1(v)f (u¯, v) + ( - 2)2(v)f (v, u¯) + (1 + 2)1(v)2(v)g(v, u¯). (3.19)

In this case, we call the vectors |(2)(u¯) and (2)(u¯)| modified on-shell vectors. The number of parameters {u1, . . . , uN } depends on the chain length and spin. In particular,
in the XXX spin-1/2 chain, N coincides with the number of sites. In the case of higher spins, N exceeds the chain length (see [8] for more details).
The main goal of this paper is to calculate an overlap

Sn,N (v¯, u¯) = (1)(v¯)|(2)(u¯) .

(3.20)

Here (1)(v¯)| and |(2)(u¯) are the eigenvectors of the corresponding transfer matrices, n = #v¯, and N = #u¯. Then according to Fermi's Golden rule for the transition between the two twists, we obtain

12 = 2 (1)(v¯)|(H(1) - H(2))|(2)(u¯) 2(2)(u¯).

(3.21)

6

Here H(1) and H(2) respectively are the Hamiltonians corresponding to the transfer matrices t(1) and t(2), and (2)(u¯) is a density of the resulting states.
In the case of the XXX spin-1/2 chains we can express Hamiltonians from the twisted
transfer matrix using

H(1) - H(2) = 2c d log t(1)(z) - log t(2)(z)

.

4 Modified Izergin determinant

In the formulas for the scalar products, a modified Izergin determinant (MID) arises.

Definition 4.1. Let u¯ = {u1, . . . , un}, v¯ = {v1, . . . , vm}, and z be arbitrary complex numbers. Then the MID Kn(z,m) (u¯|v¯) is defined by

Kn(z,m) (u¯|v¯)

=

det
m

-zjk

+

f (u¯, vj)f (vj, h(vj , vk)

v¯j )

.

(4.1)

Alternatively the MID can be presented as

Kn(z,m) (u¯|v¯)

=

(1

-

z)m-n

det
n

jk

f

(uj

,

v¯)

-

z

f (uj, h(uj ,

u¯j ) uk )

.

(4.2)

The proof of the equivalence of representations (4.1) and (4.2) can be found in proposition 4.1 of [15].
For m = n and z = 1, the MID turns into the usual Izergin determinant [16]. The latter is equal to the partition function of the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary condition [12, 16].
We will also use a conjugated MID

K n(z,)m (u¯|v¯)

=

Kn(z,m) (u¯|v¯)

c-c

=

det
m

-zjk

+

f (vj, u¯)f (v¯j, h(vk, vj )

vj )

.

(4.3)

Equivalently, it can be defined as follows:

K n(z,)m (u¯|v¯)

=

(1

-

z)m-n

det
n

jk

f

(v¯,

uj

)

-

z

f (u¯j, h(uk ,

uj ) uj )

.

(4.4)

There exist also representations for MID, which contain additional parameters.

Proposition 4.1. Let u¯ = {u1, . . . , un}, ¯ = {1, . . . , n}, v¯ = {v1, . . . , vm}, and z be arbitrary complex numbers. Then

Kn(z,m) (u¯|v¯)

=

(1

-

z)m-n(u¯)(¯)

det
n

f (uj, v¯) g(uj, ¯k)

-

zh(uj ,

¯k )

.

(4.5)

7

Proof. Let u¯ = {u1, . . . , un} be pair-wise distinct complex numbers. Consider an n × n

matrix W with the elements

Wjk

=

g(uj g(uj

, ,

u¯j ¯k

) )

.

(4.6)

Here ¯ = {1, . . . , n} are arbitrary pair-wise distinct complex numbers. The entries Wjk are proportional to the Cauchy matrix g(uj, k). Thus,

det W
n

=

(u¯)(u¯) g(u¯, ¯)

det
n

g(uj

,

k

)

=

(u¯) (¯)

.

(4.7)

Thus, the determinant of W exists and is non-vanishing. We take representation (4.2) and transform it as follows:

Kn(z,m) (u¯|v¯)

=

(1 - z)m-n detn W

det
n

f (uj, v¯)Wjk

-

z

n l=1

f (uj, h(uj ,

u¯j ) ul)

Wlk

.

(4.8)

The sum over l is easily computable. Indeed, let

Gjk

=

n =1

Wlk h(uj , ul)

=

n =1

g(u, k) h(uj , u)

g(u, u¯) g(u, ¯)

.

Then we have

1 2ic

|z|=R

g(z, k) h(uj , z)

g(z, g(z,

u¯) ¯)

dz

=

0

=

Gjk

-

h(uj, ¯k) h(uj, u¯)

.

Substituting this into (4.8) we obtain

(4.9) (4.10)

Kn(z,m) (u¯|v¯)

=

(1

-

z)m-n(¯) (u¯)

det
n

f (uj,

v¯)

g(uj g(uj

, ,

u¯j ) ¯k )

-

zg(uj ,

u¯j)h(uj ,

¯k )

.

(4.11)

Extracting the products g(uj, u¯j) we arrive at (4.5). It remains to note that the limits uj = uk and j = k (j, k = 1, . . . , n) are well defined. Indeed, in this case, the prefactor (u¯)(¯) has a pole, while the determinant vanishes. Therefore, representation (4.5) is valid for any complex u¯ and ¯.
Similarly, one can prove the following representation for the MID:

Kn(z,m) (u¯|v¯)

=

(u¯)(¯)

det
m

f (u¯,

vj )h(uj ,

¯k )

-

z g(uj ,

¯k )

.

Here ¯ = {1, . . . , m} is a set of arbitrary complex numbers.

(4.12)

Corollary 4.1. Let u¯ = {u1, . . . , un}, ¯ = {1, . . . , n}, and z be arbitrary complex numbers.

Then

(u¯)(¯) det
n

1 g(uj , ¯k)

-

zh(uj ,

¯k )

= (1 - z)n.

(4.13)

8

Proof. Setting v¯ =  in (4.5) we arrive at

(u¯)(¯) det
n

1 g(uj ,

¯k )

-

zh(uj ,

¯k )

= (1 - z)nKn(z,0)(u¯|).

(4.14)

Then (4.13) follows from (4.1). Some other properties of the MID are given in appendix A (see also [7] for a more detailed
description).

5 Overlap

Let us now proceed to the calculation of the overlap (3.20)

Sn,N (v¯, u¯) = 0|t21(v¯)12(u¯)|0 .

(5.1)

Recall that here n = #v¯ and N = #u¯. Ultimately, we are interested in the case when the parameters v¯ and u¯ respectively satisfy equations (3.3) and (3.17). However, in this paper, we consider a more general case where the parameters u¯ are arbitrary complex numbers. In a particular, they can satisfy the system (3.17). Moreover, at the first stage of calculations, we also do not impose any restrictions on the parameters v¯. We only require that n  N , because otherwise, the scalar product (5.1) vanishes.

5.1 Scalar product of off-shell vectors

It follows from (3.14) that the vector µ-N |(2)(u¯) does not depend on +. Therefore, the scalar product µ-N Sn,N (v¯, u¯) also does not depend on +. On the other hand, it follows from

(3.15) that

t21(v) = lim 21(v).
+

(5.2)

Thus,

0|t21(v¯)12(u¯)|0 = µN lim 0|21(v¯)12(u¯)|0 ,
+

(5.3)

where we used µ  1 as +  . In its turn, a formula for the scalar product 0|21(v¯)12(u¯)|0 was derived in [7]:

0|21(v¯)12(u¯)|0 = µN+n

(5.4)

Here the sum is taken over all possible partitions {v¯I, v¯II}  v¯ and {u¯I, u¯II}  u¯ without restrictions on the cardinalities of the subsets NI,II = #u¯I,II and nI,II = #v¯I,II.

Taking the limit +   in (5.4) corresponds to the limit µ  1. Thus, we obtain

Sn,N (v¯, u¯) = µN

(5.5)

The sum is taken over partitions described above. Formally, we still have no restrictions on the cardinalities of the subsets. However, the two MID in (5.5) vanish if NII < nII or NI < nI (see (4.1), (4.4)).

5.2 Scalar product with on-shell Bethe vector
Up to now both vectors were off-shell. Let (1)(v¯)| be on-shell Bethe vector, that means that the set v¯ satisfies Bethe equations (3.3). Now we can substitute the Bethe equations in the form

1(v¯II)f (v¯I, v¯II) = nII 2(v¯I)f (v¯II, v¯I).

(5.6)

Then we obtain

Sn,N (v¯, u¯) = µN

(5.8)

Let us impose an additional constraint on the twist parameters:  = -2/1. Then the sum over partitions in (5.8) can be explicitly computed via (A.6):

G(u¯I, u¯II) =-2/1 = (-1)nf (v¯, u¯I)KN(1,)n({u¯I - c, u¯II}|v¯). Respectively, the scalar product takes the form

(5.10)

The sum over partitions of the set u¯ in (5.10) is computed via proposition A.3. For this, it is enough to use representation for MID in the form (4.5)

k = 1, . . . , n, k = n + 1, . . . , N.

(5.16)

Now we can transform detN Njk(z) using corollary A.1 (see, in particular, (A.29)). Thus,

In this representation, the parameters ¯ = {n+1, . . . , N } remain arbitrary complex numbers.

5.4 Particular case
We did not impose any restrictions on the parameters u¯ in the representation (5.21). Therefore, the vector |(2)(u¯) , generally speaking, is off-shell. Consider a particular case  = 1. Then the dual vector (1)(v¯)| is an eigenvector of the ordinary transfer matrix t11(z) + t22(z). On the other hand, we find 1 = -2 from the condition  = -2/1. Then the inhomogeneous term vanishes in the modified Bethe equations (3.17). We obtain

h(uj h(u¯,

(5.22)

where  = 1 = -2. At the same time, the Bethe vectors |(2)(u¯) remain modified in this particular case. They are still given by (3.16).
We now require the vector |(2)(u¯) to be an on-shell modified Bethe vector. For this, it
is sufficient to substitute conditions (5.22) into representation (5.21). After simple algebra, we
obtain

Sn,N (v¯, u¯) = (-µ)N

(5.26)

It is easy to see that in a particular case n = N , we reproduce a determinant representation for the scalar product of the usual on-shell and the twisted on-shell Bethe vectors.

Conclusion
We have considered overlaps of Bethe vectors with a diagonal twist and modified Bethe vectors. We have shown that under one additional condition on the twist parameters, such an overlap has a determinant representation. At the same time, the modified Bethe vector can remain an off-shell vector. In this sense, the result obtained is analogous to the scalar product of on-shell and off-shell Bethe vectors [13].
However, despite this similarity, the resulting determinant representation has an entirely new structure. Namely, it contains a set of arbitrary parameters. This representation was obtained thanks to new formulas for the MID. These new formulas contain a set of arbitrary complex parameters. Depending on the specific task, these parameters can be chosen in the most convenient way. Such formulas can find applications in models with higher symmetry rank, particularly for GL(3)-invariant spin chains [17].
The resulting determinant representation for the overlap remains valid if the modified Bethe vector is the eigenvector of the modified transfer matrix. In this case, the parameters of the modified vector satisfy the inhomogeneous Bethe equations (3.17). We have considered only one specific case, when the inhomogeneous term in the Bethe equations disappears. The more general case requires further study.
One of the apparent directions for further research is the application of the obtained results to nonequilibrium physics. It is related to calculating the density of states and the thermodynamic limit. Another area to consider is models on a segment and overlaps under diagonal and non-diagonal boundary conditions. In particular, it would be desirable to obtain a modified Tsuchiya's determinant [18]. It is quite possible that the method of reducing overlaps to a system of linear equations [19] gives simple access to new formulas.

A Properties of the MID

A.1 Transformations of the MID

In this appendix, we list several properties of the MID. A more detailed list together with the proofs can be found in [7].
The MID and the conjugated one are related by

Kn(z,)m(u¯|v¯) = (1 - z)m-nKm(z,)n(v¯|u¯).

(A.1)

The MID possesses the following property under the shift of one of the set of parameters:

Kn(z,m) (u¯

-

c|v¯)

=

(-z)n(1 - z f (v¯, u¯)

)m-n

Km(1,/nz)

(v¯|u¯).

c|v¯)

=

(-z)n(1 - z f (u¯, v¯)

)m-n

(v¯|u¯).

(A.3)

Some bilinear combinations of the MID reduce to a new MID.

Proposition A.1. Let ¯, u¯, and v¯ be sets of arbitrary complex numbers such that #¯ = l, #u¯ = n, and #v¯ = m. Then

z2lI Kn(z,l1I)(u¯|¯I)Km(z,2l)II (v¯|¯II)f (¯II, ¯I)f (u¯, ¯II) = Kn(z+1mz2,)l({u¯, v¯}|¯).
{¯I,¯II}¯

(A.4)

Here lI = #¯I and lII = #¯II. The sum is taken with respect to all partitions {¯I, ¯II}  ¯. There is no any restriction on the cardinalities of the subsets.

Replacing Kn(z,l1I)(u¯|¯I) in (A.4) by the conjugated MID via (A.1) and (A.2) we obtain

A.2 Other determinants related to the MID

Proposition A.2. Let u¯ = {u1, . . . , uN }, ¯ = {1, . . . , N }, and z be arbitrary complex numbers. Let Fk(1)(u) and Fk(2)(u), k = 1, . . . , N , be two sets of functions

Fk(1)(u) = 1(u)

z g(¯k, u)

-

h(¯k, u)

+ 2(u)

1 g(u, ¯k)

-

zh(u,

¯k )

,

(A.7)

Fk(2)(u)

=

(-1)N -1 1 (u) g(u, ¯k)

-

2(u)h(u, ¯k).

(A.8)

Here (z) ( = 1, 2) are two arbitrary functions. Let us compose two N × N matrices F^(1) and

F^(2) with the entries

F^j(k1) = Fk(1)(uj ),

F^j(k2) = Fk(2)(uj ).

(A.9)

Then

det F^(1) = (z - 1)N det F^(2).

N

N

(A.10)

Proof. Obviously, both determinants can be presented in the form

det F^() =

X()(u¯I, u¯II)1(u¯I)2(u¯II),

N

{u¯I ,u¯II }u¯

 = 1, 2,

(A.11)

14

where the coefficients X()(u¯I, u¯II) do not depend on 1 and 2. Since  are arbitrary functions, equation (A.10) holds if and only if

X(1)(u¯I, u¯II) = (z - 1)N X(2)(u¯I, u¯II)

(A.12)

for an arbitrary partition {u¯I, u¯II}  u¯. However, it is easy to see that without loss of generality,
it is enough to prove (A.12) for u¯I = {u1, . . . , up} and u¯II = {up+1, . . . , uN }. Here p is an arbitrary integer from the set {0, 1, . . . , N }.
To obtain the coefficients X()(u¯I, u¯II), we should set 2(uj) = 0 for j = 1, . . . , p and 1(uj) = 0 for j = p + 1, . . . , N in (A.7) and (A.8). We obtain

X()(u¯I, u¯II) = det (),
N

 = 1, 2,

(A.13)

(A.14)

and

(j2k)

=

(-1)m-1 g(uj , ¯k)

,

j = 1, . . . , p,

(A.15)

(j2k) = -h(uj , ¯k),

j = p + 1, . . . , N.

Let uj = uj +c for j = 1, . . . , p and uj = uj for j = p+1, . . . , N . Using 1/g(uj , ¯k) = h(uj , ¯k) and h(¯k, uj) = (-1)N-1/g(uj , ¯k) (see (2.12)) for k = 1, . . . , p, we obtain

X () (u¯I ,

where

(j1k)

=

1 g(uj , ¯k)

- zh(uj , ¯k),

(j2k) = h(uj , ¯k),

j, k = 1, . . . , N.

It is easy to see that detN (2) reduces to the Cauchy determinant:

(A.17)

det (2) = h(u¯, ¯) det

N

N

1 h(uj , k)

=

1 (¯)(u¯)

(A.18)

The determinant of (1) is computed in corollary 4.1. Due to (4.13), we have

det (1)
N

=

(1 - z)N (¯)(u¯

)

.

(A.19)

Comparing this equation with (A.18) and using (A.16) we see that

X(1)(u¯I, u¯II) = (z - 1)N X(2)(u¯I, u¯II).

(A.20)

15

Corollary A.1. Let 0  n  N , and let u¯ = {u1, . . . , uN }, ¯ = {n+1, . . . , N }, and z be arbitrary complex numbers (¯ =  for n = N ). Let us compose two N × N matrices F^(01) and F^(02) with the entries

F^j(k01) =

Fk(0)(uj ), Fk(1)(uj ),

k = 1, . . . , n, k = n + 1, . . . , N,

(A.21)

F^j(k02) =

Fk(0)(uj ), Fk(2)(uj ),

k = 1, . . . , n, k = n + 1, . . . , N.

(A.22)

Here Fk(1)(u) and Fk(2)(u) respectively are given by (A.7) and (A.8), while Fk(0)(u), k = 1, . . . , n, are arbitrary functions. Then

det F^(01) = (z - 1)N-n det F^(02).

N

(A.23)

Proof. Developing the determinant det F^(01) with respect to the first k columns we obtain

{u¯I ,u¯II }u¯

(A.24)

Here the sum is taken over partitions {u¯I, u¯II}  u¯ such that #u¯I = n and #u¯II = N - n.
Notation uIj (resp. uIjI) means the jth element of the subset u¯I (resp. u¯II). Finally, PI,II is the parity of the partition {u¯I, u¯II}  u¯.
Due to proposition A.2

det

Fk(1)(uIjI)

= (z - 1)N-n det
N -n

Taking the sum over partitions we arrive at (A.23). In particular, setting

1(u) = (-1)N ^1(u)h(v¯, u), 2(u) = ^2(u)h(u, v¯),

(A.27)

we obtain

Fk(1)(uj ) = Nj(k2),

k = n + 1, . . . , N,

where Nj(k2) is given by (5.18). Due to corollary A.1, we obtain

(A.28)

Here

det F^(01) = (z - 1)N-n det F^(02).

A.3 Summation formula

Let a function H(u¯) of N variables u¯ = {u1, . . . , uN } be defined as follows:

H (u¯)

=

(u¯)

det
N

k (uj

).

Here k(u) is a set of one-variable functions.

Proposition A.3. Let 1(u) and 2(u) be one-variable functions. Then

(A.32)

1(u¯I)2(u¯II)f (u¯II, u¯I)H({u¯I - c, u¯II}) = (u¯) det
N

1(uj )k(uj - c) + 2(uj )k(uj )

.

{u¯I,u¯II}u¯

(A.33)

The sum is taken over all possible partitions {u¯I, u¯II}  u¯, and we used the shorthand notation

for the products of the functions (u),  = 1, 2.

Proof. The proof is similar to the one of proposition A.2. The rhs of (A.33) can be presented as follows:

(u¯) det
N

1(uj )k(uj - c) + 2(uj)k(uj )

=

X(u¯I, u¯II)1(u¯I)2(u¯II),

{u¯I,u¯II}u¯

(A.34)

where the coefficients X(u¯I, u¯II) do not depend on 1 and 2. Since  are arbitrary functions, equation (A.33) holds if and only if

X(u¯I, u¯II) = f (u¯II, u¯I)H({u¯I - c, u¯II}),

(A.35)

for an arbitrary partition {u¯I, u¯II}  u¯. Due to the symmetry of (A.33) over u¯, it is enough to prove (A.35) for u¯I = {u1, . . . , up} and u¯II = {up+1, . . . , uN }. Here p is an arbitrary integer from the set {0, 1, . . . , N }.
To obtain the coefficients X(u¯I, u¯II), we should set 2(uj) = 0 for j = 1, . . . , p and 1(uj) = 0 for j = p + 1, . . . , N in (A.33). We obtain

X(u¯I, u¯II) = (u¯I)(u¯II)g(u¯II, u¯I) det ,
N

(A.36)

where

jk = k(uj - c), j = 1, . . . , p, jk = k(uj), j = p + 1, . . . , N.

(A.37)

Let uj = uj + c for j = 1, . . . , p and uj = uj for j = p + 1, . . . , N . Using g(x, y + c) = -1/h(y, x) for any x and y, we obtain

(u¯I)(u¯II)g(u¯II, u¯I)

=

(-1)p(N

-p)

(u¯I)(u¯II h(u¯I, u¯II)

)

=

f

(u¯) (u¯I, u¯II

)

.

(A.38)

17

Then (A.36) takes the form

X(u¯I, u¯II)

=

(u¯) f (u¯I, u¯II)

det
N

k

(uj

)

=

f

H (u¯ ) (u¯I, u¯II

)

.

(A.39)

Turning back to the original variables and using f (x - c, y) = 1/f (y, x) for any x and y we arrive at (A.35).
We deal with a particular case of the sum (A.33) in equation (5.10). Indeed, let

1(u) = 1(u)f (v¯, u),

2(u)

=

2 1

2(u),

k(u)

=

f (u, v¯) g(u, ¯k)

-

zh(u, ¯k),

where ¯ = {1, . . . , N } are arbitrary complex numbers. Then

(¯)H(u¯) = (1 - z)N-nKN(z,)n(u¯|v¯).

Hence, due to proposition A.3, we obtain

(A.40) (A.41)

{u¯I,u¯II}u¯

2 1

NII 2(u¯II)1(u¯I)f (u¯II, u¯I)f (v¯, u¯I)KN(1,)n({u¯I - c, u¯II}|v¯)

Using equations (2.12) we easily transform this result to representation (5.12).
