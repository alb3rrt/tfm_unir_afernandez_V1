## Abstract

The proper motions of stars in the outskirts of globular clusters are used to estimate their velocity dispersion profiles to as far as possible within their tidal radii. We use the color-magnitude diagram to select high probability cluster stars for 25 globular clusters within 20 kpc of the sun, 19 of which have substantial numbers of stars at large radii. Of the 19, 11 clusters have a falling velocity dispersion in the 3-6 half mass radii range, 6 are flat or falling, and 2 plausibly have a rising velocity dispersion. The profiles are all in the range expected from simulated clusters started at high redshift in a zoom-in cosmological simulation. A cluster that is at a sub-halo center can lead to a rising velocity dispersion profile. Additional cluster membership criteria and improved kinematic data will further test these preliminary results.
