By controlling quantum fluctuations via the Falk­Bruch inequality we give the first rigorous argument for the existence of a spin-glass phase in the quantum Sherrington­Kirkpatrick model with a "transverse" magnetic field if the temperature and the field are sufficiently low. The argument also applies to the generalization of the model with multi-spin interactions, sometimes dubbed as transverse p-spin model.

One of the most many-faceted areas in the statistical mechanics of disordered systems are spin glasses. Classical spin-glass models as the mean-field one by Sherrington­ Kirkpatrick (SK) were originally introduced to describe the unusual magnetic properties observed in some metal alloys with irregularly competing ferro- and anti-ferromagnetic interactions. Beyond their original motivation in condensedmatter physics [17], spin glasses with their built-in frustration evolved into paradigms in optimization, information processing and the theory of neural networks [28, 32]. Their rich lowenergy structure and complexity continues to generate deep scientific discoveries. For example, among the recent excitements in computation is a conditional proof (based on the widely believed assumption of continuous replica-symmetry breaking) of the existence of a polynomial-time classical algorithm for finding an approximate bit-string whose energy is with high probability -close to the lowest SK energy [29]. Such an algorithm is not believed to exist for a search of the ground state in p-spin generalizations of the SK model. Quantum mechanics promises to offer help in the form of quantum adiabatic annealing or quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA) [3, 4, 6, 8, 14, 16, 21]. In this context, but also purely motivated by the fact that spin glasses are prototypes for the emergence of non-ergodic behaviour in disordered quantum systems [5, 23, 31, 38], it is important to study quantum versions of classical spin-glass models. This can be done by taking the quantum nature of spins seriously and by adding a "transverse" magnetic field to the classical energy landscape, which induces quantum effects. Most prominent is the quantum Sherrington­Kirkpatrick spin-glass model (QSKM) with N  2 three-component vector spins of main quantum number 1/2 (or Qbits). Their z-components interact with each other in a random fashion, while their xcomponents interact individually with a constant magnetic field of strength b  0 externally applied along the positive x-direction. Up to a factor 1/2 each spin operator may be

represented by the triple of Pauli matrices according to

and can be lifted to the tensor-product Hilbert space HN := Nj=1 2. The QSKM Hamiltonian (or energy operator) is
then defined as the sum

In this part the spins are pairwise coupled through independent, identically distributed Gaussian random variables (gjk) with mean [g12] = 0 and variance g122 = 1, modeling frozen-in spatial disorder in the glass. The parameter J > 0 is the standard deviation of Jg12 and stands for the strength of the disorder.
As usual, the thermal average at reciprocal temperature
  ]0, [ is given by the canonical Gibbs expectation · := tr e-HN ( · )/ZN with the partition function ZN :=
tr e-HN as the normalization factor. For b = 0 there is no a-
priori globally preferred orientation and no conventional mag-
netic order arises. Yet, one expects spin-glass order even at b  0 in the sense that [qN ] = S1zS2z 2 > 0 in the limit of a "macroscopically" large number of spins (N  ), pro-
vided that the temperature and the field are sufficiently low.
Here we are using the model's spin-index symmetry under the
(probabilistic) disorder expectation [ · ] and the [0, 1]-valued
random variable

of [qN ] = S1zS2z 2 is equivalent to replica-symmetry

breaking (as N  ).

The main result of this paper is a proof of this replica-

symmetry breaking at small enough temperatures and field

strength. This is facilitated by extending a key observation of

Aizenman, Lebowitz, and Ruelle in their pioneering paper [2]

to the present quantum case, b > 0: the mean order parameter [qN ] is related to the mean energy HN(0) of the zero-
field part of the Hamiltonian. Specifically, by the spin-index

symmetry and a standard Gaussian integration by parts it is

straightforward to obtain

It satisfies the well-known a-priori estimates 0  A 2  A|A  A2 = 1, where the inequalities hold for general
(self-adjoint) A = A and the equality is due to A2 = ½ for
the present A. In the classical commutative case, b = 0, the third inequality is also an equality and (4) turns into (4.1) of
[2] (for Gaussian disorder). For general b  0 we need a lower bound on A|A bet-
ter than A 2 in order to obtain a non-trivial lower bound on A 2 from (4). As our second main ingredient in the
proof, we therefore control the quantum fluctuations by the
Falk­Bruch inequality [15] (see also [13, 37]):

A|A   A, [HN , A] /4 .

(5)

The function  : [0, [  ]0, 1] from the positive half-line to
the left-open unit interval is defined implicitly by the relation  r tanh(r) := r-1 tanh(r) and turns out to be monotone decreasing and convex with (0) = 1. Moreover, it can be estimated from below according to (t)  t-1(1 - e-t), see
[13]. We also note that the Gibbs expectation of the double
commutator in the argument of  in (5) is equal to the scalar

product [HN , A] [HN , A] and hence positive for a general self-adjoint A. Since the present A = S1zS2z commutes with HN(0), the double commutator is independent of J and
simply given by

A, [HN , A] = 4b(S1x + S2x) .

(6)

Combining (4), (5), (6), and using Jensen's inequality for the convex  together with spin-index symmetry yields our main result:

It is valid for any  > 0, J > 0, b  0, and all N  2.

In case b = 0, the inequality (7) is in fact an equality. For small b > 0 the Falk­Bruch inequality remains rather sharp, so that we expect (7) as it stands to be reasonably effective in the regime b  1  J and in particular up to the zerofield critical (freezing) temperature J. For J < 1 there is no spin-glass phase according to [24].
A less effective, but more explicit form of (7) leads to the bound

for the smallest limit point of the sequence [qN ] N2 in the unit interval [0, 1]. Here -J < 0 is the (almost surely non-
random) ground-state energy of HN(0)/N as N   with the constant   0.76 according to [10]. For the first term in (8)
we have used the monotonicity of  and the estimate S1x  tanh(b) for the transverse magnetization. The latter follows
by adding to the Hamiltonian (1) the term (b - b1)S1x with b1  0 and estimating the associated "local" susceptibility:

.

Integrating this differential inequality by "separation of variables" and observing S1x 0 = 0 yields the claimed estimate.
For b = 0 the right-hand side of (8) is strictly positive for temperatures below J/(2)  0.66 J. This (not maximal) temperature regime for the existence of a spin-glass phase
agrees with the one found in (4.14) of [2]. In this regime
the spin-glass phase is proved by (8) to survive when turning on the transverse magnetic field, provided that b/J is so
small that the right-hand side of (8) remains strictly positive. The asymptotics (2b)  (2b)-1 as    shows that
this holds true at zero temperature up to the field strength J/(4)  0.33 J. These facts are illustrated in Figure 1, which also includes the regime J < 1 where it is known [24] that limN qN = 0. In combination, these results rigorously prove the existence of a phase transition related to
replica-symmetry breaking in the QSKM.

FIG. 1: In the temperature-field plane the (red) cross-shaded regime indicates where we prove, using (8), the existence of spin-glass order in the QSKM. The (red) dashed line is a cartoon of the critical line between the spin-glass and the paramagnetic phase as obtained by approximate arguments and/or numerical methods [20, 30, 41­43]. The (blue) line-shaded regime for J < 1 indicates where the spinglass order parameter is rigorously known to vanish [24].

Approximate and/or numerical results suggest that the QSKM has a quantum phase transition at zero temperature and b/J  1.51 or 1.6 according to [20, 30, 41­43]. The precise location and nature of this quantum critical point remains an important problem in particular in the context of adiabatic algorithms. We emphasize that our bound yields even at zero temperature a spin-glass phase. This supports the conjecture that the ground state typically has localization properties with respect to the eigenbasis of HN(0). It does not rule out though a weak form of restoration of ergodicity through quantum tunneling for those parameters put forward in [30, 31]. To clarify this question it is necessary to consider the probabilistic distribution function of the order parameter and not just its mean, because the sequence (qN )N2 is not expected to be self-averaging (in the spin-glass phase).
In this context, one may recall that for b = 0 the (specific mean) free energy, - limN [ln ZN ]/(N ), is explicitly known thanks to Parisi's variational formula and the replica overlap is known to take continuous values in the (zero-field) glass phase [10, 34, 35, 40]. In contrast, no closed-form expressions are available for b > 0 and most studies resorted to approximate or numerical methods [39]. Recently the QSKM free energy, which previously has been proved to exist and to be independent of the specific probability distribution of the coupling coefficient g12 as long as |g12|3 <  (see [9]), was shown to be given by a variational formula in terms of a Parisi-like functional for an infinite-dimensional vector-spin model [1]. However, no conclusion could so far be drawn about emerging phases form this formula. In contrast, for the simpler case J < 1 another approach has established that

3

the free energy coincides with its annealed version and that there is no spin-glass phase [24].
For a family of quantum hierarchical models dubbed QGREM, which for b = 0 were originally introduced by Derrida [11] as approximations to the more difficult SK model, explicit formulas for the free energy are available [26] also for b > 0. Unlike for their classical counterparts, the resulting phase diagrams of these QGREMs seem to capture the QSKM only on a qualitative level though, since they exhibit a critical line reaching up to J = 0 which separates a quantum paramagnetic phase from a classical one at high temperatures.

The above simple strategy for proving replica-symmetry breaking has straightforward extensions. From our proof it is evident that Theorem 1 remains true as it stands if one adds to (1) any term commuting with HN(0), possibly random but independent of HN(0) as, for example, a Zeeman term corresponding to a magnetic field in z-direction. Adapting the moreinvolved argument of [2], our bounds can also be extended from Gaussian to more general symmetric distributions of the coupling coefficients.
This strategy can also be applied to quantum spin-glass models with multi-spin interactions, for example to the "transverse p-spin model". This model generalizes the zero-field part (2) of (1) for each natural p  2 to

HN(0) = -J

p! 2N p-1

gj1j2...jp Sjz1 Sjz2 · · · Sjzp ,

1j1 <···<jp N

where (gj1j2...jp ) are independent and identically distributed standard Gaussian random variables. For p > 2 this classi-
cal zero-field Hamiltonian exhibits at its freezing temperature
discrete and not continuous replica-symmetry breaking [18].
Proceeding for the quantum model as in (4) and introducing p(N ) := N ! (N - p)! N p , which converges to one as N  , the mean zero-field energy

HN(0) = -J p(N ) g12...p S1z S2z · · · Spz

N p+1 p! 2

is now related to the mean of the p-th power of the replicaoverlap operator

RNp  = p(N ) S1zS2z · · · Spz 2 + op(N )

where op(N ) is a term which goes to zero as N  .

for any  > 0, J > 0, b  0, and all N  p.
As before, we may further estimate the transverse magnetization, S1x  tanh(b), and employ for a bound on the second term in (9) the specific ground-state energy of the zerofield p-spin model, which itself is asymptotically (as N  ) lower bounded by -J ln 2, the known value for p  , using Slepian's lemma (see [7]). This proves a spin-glass phase in the low field/low temperature part of the conjectured phase diagram [12, 33]. However, the higher we choose p, the smaller the regime becomes, where a spin-glass phase can be shown to exist. In the limit p   replica-symmetry breaking cannot be concluded by the above strategy.
This limit corresponds to the quantum random energy model (QREM), characterized by the zero-field part HN(0) = -Jg N/2 with standard Gaussian random variables (g ), which are independent and identically distributed for distinct z-configurations   {-1, 1}N . In this case the phase diagram is known [19] for general  and b  0, even at the rigorous level [25]. As Goldschmidt's calculations [19] suggest, in the spin-glass phase the complete distribution of the replica overlap RN  of the QREM turns out to agree with its classical analogue. In particular, one can prove [27] that limN RN  = 1 - 2 ln 2/(J ).
