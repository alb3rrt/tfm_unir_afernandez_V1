Spontaneous symmetry breaking is the foundation of electroweak unification and serves as the integral part of model building beyond the standard model of particle physics. In this paper, we review the efforts to obtain late cosmic acceleration from spontaneous symmetry breaking in the Universe at large scales. This phenomenon is best understood through Ginzburg-Landau theory of phase transitions which we briefly describe. Hereafter, we present elements of spontaneous symmetry breaking in relativistic field theory. We then discuss the "symmetron" scenario based upon symmetry breaking in the late Universe which is realized by using a specific form of conformal coupling. However, the model is faced with "NO GO" to late time acceleration due to local gravity constraints. We argue that the problem can be circumvented by using the massless 4 theory coupled to massive neutrino matter. In this case, coupling builds up dynamically at late stages of evolution giving rise to Z2 symmetry breaking; coupling vanishes at early times keeping Z2 symmetry intact. As a result, the field picks a non-zero mass in the true ground state proportional to neutrino mass, thereby, with little adjustments, one can achieve late time acceleration in this framework.
I. INTRODUCTION
Accelerated expansion is generic to our universe; it is believed that the Universe has gone through inflation at early times [1­3], and again entered into the accelerating phase in the recent past [4, 5]. Despite the grand successes, the hot big bang has to its credit, the model has internal inconsistencies: (i) Inconsistencies related to the early universe include, for instance, the flatness problem and horizon problem which are beautifully addressed by the paradigm of inflation- brief early phase of accelerated expansion. (ii) The Age puzzle is necessarily related to late time evolution and the only known way to address it in the standard lore is provided by the late time cosmic acceleration. The phenomenon is confirmed by direct as well as by indirect observations and constitutes one of the most remarkable discoveries of modern cosmology. As for the theoretical understanding, if one adheres to Einstein's theory of general relativity (GR), it necessarily asks for the presence of an exotic matter, repulsive in nature, dubbed dark energy [6­9]. It would be fair to state that the underlying cause of the late time acceleration remains to be the mystery of our times. It is plausible to look for a distinguished physical process in the late universe with a characteristic mass scale around that of dark energy. And this draws our attention to neutrino matter, which is one of the most abundant components of the universe today [10]. Interestingly, the order of magnitude of neutrino masses is close to the mass scale of dark energy such that massive neutrinos turn non-relativistic around the present epoch. And certainly, this is a generic late time process in the universe with the characteristic mass scale one is looking for. It is tempting to ask whether this process can trigger a late time phase transition in the universe responsible for turning deceleration into acceleration.
Let us note that symmetron was one of the first model that attempted to realize the idea of late time symmetry breaking or phase transition in the Universe [11], see Refs.[12­19] on the related theme. The model is based upon the 4 theory with direct coupling of the field to matter (coupling is typically proportional to the trace of energy momentum tensor of matter). Symmetron scenario is based upon Z2 symmetry which is exact in the high density regime (locally), the symmetry is broken in low density regime at large scales giving rise to the true ground state where the field should ultimately settle to mimic de-Sitter like solution of interest to late time acceleration. Unfortunately, the scenario fails due to local gravity constraints which impose stringent constraints on any model which involves direct coupling to matter. Indeed, proper local screening of the extra degree of freedom in this case requires that mass of the scalar field be O(104H0) which is too large (compared to H0) to support slow roll around true ground state obtained after symmetry breaking.

The problem faced by symmetron model can be circumvented assuming coupling of the field to massive neutrino matter[20­24] proportional to its trace, which vanishes as long as the neutrinos are relativistic1. In this case, coupling builds up dynamically at late times when massive neutrinos become non-relativistic and mimic cold matter ( = 0). Another distinguished features of the scenario include: (i) After symmetry breaking, mass of the field gets naturally linked to the density of massive neutrino matter. (ii) Secondly, local gravity constraints do not apply to the neutrino matter, thereby, no extra constraint on mass of the scalar field.
The plan of the review is as follows. For pedagogical considerations, we present glimpses of Ginzburg-Landau theory of phase transitions (section II) which inspired the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking in field theory. We then argue that spontaneous symmetry breaking does not take place in finite systems; quantum tunnelling removes the classical degeneracy of the ground state (section III). In section IV, we provide brief discussion on symmetry breaking in field theory. In Section V, we bring out the details of the scenario that uses the direct coupling of the scalar field to matter and show that coupling to massive neutrino matter can evade "NO GO" faced by the "symmetron" model.
This review is pedagogical in nature, it aims at young researchers not acquainted with high energy physics. People familiar with spontaneous symmetry breaking may directly jump to section V after briefly looking through GinzburgLandau theory of phase transitions. Review should be read with footnotes which include additional explanations and clarifications. We use the metric signature, (-, +, +, +) and the notation for the reduced Planck mass, MP-l2 = 8G along with the system of units, = c = 1.

II. GLIMPSES OF GINZBURG-LANDAU THEORY OF PHASE TRANSITIONS

The mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking serves as the foundation of electroweak theory. The underlying idea is essentially inspired by the thermodynamic theory of phase transitions known as Ginzburg-Landau theory. It is based upon the following assumptions: (i) The thermodynamic potentials (Gibbs Free energy, Gibbs potential and others) apart from the standard thermodynamic variables such as Pressure (P), Entropy (S), Temperature (T) etc also depend upon an additional parameter dubbed order parameter, (ii) In the small neighbourhood of phase transition, the thermodynamic potentials can be represented through Taylor series in the order parameter retaining even powers of the latter. In case of para-ferromagnetic transition, the order parameter is represented by, spontaneous magnetization (non-vanishing magnetization in absence of external magnetic field), for para-to ferroelectric transition, the order parameter is given by spontaneous polarization, in case of superconducting phase transition, it is the Cooper pair density and so on2.
Let us emphasize that the thermodynamics description applies to the equilibrium state of a system which is distinguished in a sense that it corresponds to the minimum of thermodynamic potentials: A thermodynamic system not in equilibrium, left uninterrupted, would ultimately enter into the equilibrium state. Thus, the extremal property of thermodynamic potentials is essentially associated with the criteria of stability. Let us also note that unlike the case of conservative forces, the work done in thermodynamics is process-dependent quantity, thereby, there is no unique potential; often used thermodynamic potentials include- internal energy (U), Gibbs free energy (F), Gibbs potential (G) and enthalpy (W).
In what follows, we shall use Gibbs potential which, apart from the standard thermodynamic variables P and T, should also be a function of the order parameter,

G = G(P, T, x; ),

(1)

where x is an external field and  denotes the order parameter. According to Ginzburg-Landau assumption, the Gibbs potential can be expanded into Taylor series in  in the neighbourhood of the critical point,

1 Coupling  T =  (3 -1);  &  being the equation of state parameter and energy density of massive neutrino matter respectively.
At early times, neutrino matter is relativistic or  = 1/3 such that coupling vanishes. 2 As for the Higgs mechanism, the order parameter is given by the non-vanishing vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field.

3

Let us note that the physical quantities are given by the first and second derivatives of thermodynamic potentials, which implies, in particular, that G must be continuous, otherwise the physical quantities would be ill defined. It is imperative that a(P, T ), b(P, T ) are continuous functions of P and T . Since G should be minimum in the state of thermodynamic equilibrium, for fixed values of T and P, we have,

G

2G

= 0; 

2 > 0

(4)

which implies,

[a(T, P ) + b(T, P )2] = 0; a(T, P ) + 3b(T, P )2 > 0

(5)

that allows us to determine the order parameter along with stability conditions, dictated by the inequality in expression (5),

0,

a(T, P ) > 0 ,

(T, P ) =

a(T,P ) b(T,P )

,

a(T, P ) < 0

(6)

From the continuity of functions, a and b also follows the continuity of the order parameter (T, P ). Eq.(6) tells us that the order parameter vanishes for a(T, P ) > 0 but picks up the nonzero value for a(T, P ) < 0. In the second case, the state of minimum energy or ground state, is doubly degenerate. Since a(T, P ) is a continuous function of its variables, thereby, while changing sign, it passes through zero for certain values of T = Tc, P = Pc dubbed the critical point,

a(Tc, Pc) = 0  (Tc, Pc) = 0

FIG. 1: Plot of the Gibbs potential versus the order parameter . For T  Tc, the minimum of the potential is given by  = 0. As temperature drops below Tc, the doubly degenerate symmetric minima appear for  = ± -a/b, minima follows the reflection symmetry (  -) of the Ginzburg-Landau expression (2) written, for simplicity, in one dimension.

For phenomenological reasons, we will assign temperatures larger than the critical value, T  Tc to the phase of the system with vanishing order parameter. The order parameter picks up the nonzero values below the critical
point T < TC. The two phases of the thermodynamic system are clearly distinguished by the behaviour of the order parameter across the critical point or the phase transition. The situation is well summarized in Fig.2. For a familiar,
namely, the magnetic system, this implies that as the system cools below TC, the true ground state is the one with non-vanishing order parameter- spontaneous magnetization, MS = 0 signaling phase transition from para (MS = 0) to ferromagnetic state (MS = 0), see Fig.2. For simplicity, we considered a one dimensional system. Thus the direction
of MS "Up" or "Down" given by the sign of the order parameter (MS = ± -a/b). In order to investigate the system further, we need to choose one of the ground states3; the moment we do so, the "Up"- "Down" symmetry (  -)

3 For instance, as a next step, we should understand the effect of the external field on the ferromagnetic properties of the system.

4

FIG. 2: A cartoon diagram which shows phase transition from paramagnetic state to ferromagnetic state as the temperature drops below the critical temperature. After phase transition, the system acquires a domain structure such that the magnetization is non-zero in absence of an external magnetic field dubbed spontaneous magnetization which obviously vanishes in case of paramagnetic state. Ferromagnetic state in three dimensions adheres to rotational symmetry which is lost when a particular direction of magnetization is chosen. In this case, the order parameter is spontaneous magnetization with three components.

of (1) is lost- which corresponds to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Ferromagnetism is one of the first examples of symmetry breaking.
To understand the behaviour of the order parameter in the neighbourhood of the critical point (T < TC), one expands a(T, P ) series retaining the linear term,

(8)

The nature of the phase transition is defined by the behaviour of the first and second derivatives of G (physical quantities of interest) at the critical point. To this effect, one defines the jump of a physical quantity across the critical point,

[X] = (X=0 - X=0) |T =TC

(9)

As mentioned before G(P, T ; ) is continuous at the critical point,

a2(T, P )

G(P, T ; ) = G0(P, T ) - 4b(T, P )

(10)

The first derivative of G with respect to T gives,

a(2a b - ab )

S - S0 =

4b2

 [S] = 0 (a(T = Tc) = 0)

(11)

where prime denotes derivative with respect to temperature and S = -G/T . One can easily verify that the first derivative with respect to P is also continuous across the critical point. Similarly one computes the jump of the second derivatives, for instance,

[CP ] =

 T T (S - S0)

|T =TC

=

(a 2T )C 2bC

(12)

where a (T = TC ) = 0 & a(T = TC ) = 0 (see Eqs.(7) and (8))4. Same conclusion applies to the mixed derivatives

4 We remind the reader that, bC > 0, from stability considerations, see Eqs.(2) or (3).

(isothermal/adiabatic comprehensibility). The aforesaid defines the type of phase transition- Phase transition is termed as of first/second order if the first/second derivatives of the thermodynamic potential are discontinuous at the critical point. Thus, the Ginzburg-Landau theory based upon expression (2) describes phase transitions of second order. In this framework, the first-order phase transition can be captured by adding the next higher order term in  (O(6)) to the Gibbs potential (2).

III. DEGENERACY OF GROUND STATE AND QUANTUM MECHANICAL CONSIDERATION

As demonstrated in the preceding section, ground state of the thermodynamic system becomes degenerate for T < TC. Question arises, would the quantum tunnelling between degenerate ground states (vacua) lift the degeneracy? To address this question, let us first consider a particle moving in a double well potential in one dimension,

V (x)

a)2(x

+ a)2; Hb

=

(a)2 8

(13)

where Hb denotes the height of the potential barrier between minima, see Fig.3. In the limit a  , the problem decomposes into the sum of two independent harmonic oscillators5. For a large value of a, two lowest energy wave
functions are approximately given by the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the harmonic-oscillator wave
functions,

Due to quantum tunnelling, there is energy split between the symmetric and antisymmetric states,

Es,a = 2

  E 2

(15)

E = A e-16Hb/3 

(16)

where A is a constant whose exact form is not important for the present discussion. The exponential term in (16) is the tunnelling probability Pt  e-16Hb/3  between largely separated vacua6. In the case of two/three dimensions, Hb would be replaced by the surface area/volume of the barrier. For an infinite system, one can argue on heuristic grounds that Pt would vanish exponentially. Indeed, if one is dealing with a field which belongs to infinite dimensional space, the volume of the barrier is infinite. We therefore conclude that in quantum mechanics, the degeneracy is lifted
by quantum tunnelling. However, if there is a classical degeneracy in field theory, it can not be lifted by quantum tunnelling giving rise to spontaneous symmetry breaking7. The thermodynamic system deals with a large number of
particles and practically mimics an infinite system and this answers the question we had posed.

5 In this case, minima are separated by infinite distance with an infinite barrier between them. 6 Tunnelling probability can be computed using instantons-classical solutions that exist for imaginary time (Euclidean space). 7 In scalar field theory with multiple vacua, there exists no instanton which supports the heuristic argument that spontaneous symmetry
breaking is generic to infinite systems.

IV. SPONTANEOUS SYMMETRY BREAKING IN FIELD THEORY

The mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking is at the heart of electroweak unification, see [25] and references therein (also [26], a relatively unknown reference). It was clear from Fermi theory of weak interactions that the mediation in this case should be provided by massive vector bosons and Fermi theory of contact interactions was inconsistent in the high energy regime. However, putting mass by hand destroys the renormalizability of the theory. The situation was rescued by the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking, which consistently generates the masses of the vector bosons. In what follows, we briefly describe the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking in field theory.
Let us consider the scalar field Lagrangian,

L

=

-

1 2

µµ

-

V

();

V () = - 1 µ22 + 1 4

2

4

(17)

where the mass term has the wrong sign for µ2 > 0. The chosen Lagrangian has reflection symmetry,   -. The ground state of the system is obtained by minimizing the potential V (). If µ2 < 0, the minimum of the potential is
given by,

0  v   0 = 0,

(18)

where v designates the vacuum expectation value of the field. However, we shall be interested in the Lagrangian with the wrong mass sign when 0 = 0 is no longer the minimum of the potential. Indeed, in this case, tachyonic instability builds up in the system leading it to the true ground state,

µ2

 0 = ±v = ±

, 

(19)

which is doubly degenerate. In order to develop the perturbation theory , one needs to fix a vacuum state to compute small fluctuations around it. Thanks to the symmetry of the Lagrangian, we can choose any of the two vacua. However, after we make the choice, the underlying symmetry might be lost- vacuum state breaks the symmetry of the Lagrangian. Let us choose the ground state, 0 = v, and compute the mass of the field around it,

m2

=

d2 d2 |0=v

=

2µ2



 m = 2µ

(20)

However, the information about our choice of ground state would be reflected in the Lagrangian if we rewrite it through  field (dubbed field shifting),

(x) = v + (x)   0 = 0

(21)

7

which is equivalent to shifting the minimum at  = 0 around which we can study small fluctuations. Lagrangian (17) expressed in terms of  field acquires the form,

(22)

which readily tells us that the Lagrangian in  has the right sign of mass term with mass of the field given by, m = 2µ, which is implicit before the field shifting. One should notice that the mass content of the model is explicit if the Lagrangian is expressed through a field with zero vacuum expectation value. However, the Lagrangian (22) also contains a new cubic interaction which breaks the original symmetry of the Lagrangian. Thus, while choosing one of the ground states and living there, one can not see the original symmetry of the system `a la secret symmetry according to Sidney Coleman [27].

FIG. 4: Scalar field potential V () corresponding to the Lagrangian (17). In case, µ2 < 0, potential has a unique minimum at  = 0 = 0. For µ2 > 0, due to wrong mass sign, the field potential has two symmetric minima for  = 0 = ±v.

(31)

which is, however, not explicit10, in the Lagrangian (29). Not surprising, we have not yet convened the Lagrangian that we have selected (28) as our ground state. Lagrangian would know about our choice only after we shift the field. In this case, we need to shift only  field,

Before going ahead, let us clearly spell out the operational definition of "Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking".

Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking: Thanks to the underlying symmetry, choosing a preferred ground state from the degenerate vacuum followed by the shifting of the field such that the vacuum expectation value of the shifted field vanishes.
 We can easily read off the masses of fields from (33) as, m = 0 and m = 2µ. Thus after symmetry breaking, one of the fields  has the standard mass whereas the  field is massless dubbed Goldstone boson11. This is a general feature of models with spontaneous symmetry breaking (in case of global symmetry), namely, the number of Goldstone bosons is related to the number of generators of the underlying symmetry group which violate the symmetry of the vacuum. For instance, let us consider a Lagrangian invariant under the global SU (2) group (three generators) with a field as complex doublet (four real components). In this case after symmetry breaking, one of the field components acquires the standard mass as before, the remaining three field components are Goldstone bosons.
In what follows, we shall examine the spontaneous symmetry breaking of U1 local symmetry giving rise to a miraculous effect known as the Higgs mechanism which allows for consistent generation of gauge boson masses. This mechanism was also used for the generation of a tiny mass of graviton in massive gravity. Unfortunately, massive gravity theories are plagued with formidable problems irrespective of the way mass of the graviton is obtained. We briefly present the historical account of massive gravity theories before discussing the Higgs mechanism.

B. Mass of graviton: From Pauli-Fierz theory to date
The first theory of massive gravity was proposed by Pauli and Fierz in 1939 [28]. It is a linear theory where gravity is represented by a spin-2 field with a cleverly constructed mass term for graviton such that the theory has 5 degrees of freedom consistent with the group-theoretic framework. In this theory, the mass term is chosen in a specific way such that the sixth degree of freedom, a ghost, is laid to rest. Since gravity is weak in the solar system, one might expect that the linear theory would suffice locally. However, van Dam, Veltman [29] and independently Zakharov [30] discovered in 1970 that Pauli-Firz theory was plagued with a problem dubbed vDVZ discontinuity, namely, the predictions of the theory did not match with that of the General Theory of Relativity in the massless graviton limit. In 1971, Vainstein [31] pointed out that the assumption of linearity was not valid and a non-linear background should be invoked which would remove the vDVZ discontinuity. Actually, in the non-linear background, the discontinuity disappears but the sixth degree of freedom becomes alive as the Boulware-Deser ghost [32] (see [33, 34] for reviews).
Let us note that the original motivation for massive gravity was to write down a consistent relativistic equation for spin-2 field followed by Dirac equation. The contemporary revival of the idea is associated with an attempt to obtain late time acceleration from a tiny mass of graviton of the order of H0  10-33eV which can be understood using a heuristic argument. Indeed, in case graviton has a mass mg, the gravitational potential of a massive body with mass M at a distance r from the source is given by, (r) = (-GM/r)e-mgr which reduces to Newtonian expression for r m-g 1. In case, r  m-g 1, i.e, at the horizon scale, gravity weakens which is equivalent to putting a positive cosmological constant, to compensate for attractive Newtonian contribution, in the standard lore of FLRW cosmology. Thus, if a consistent theory of massive gravity is constructed, it could address the puzzle of the millennium- the underlying cause for late time acceleration or dark energy.
One might naively think that Pauli-Fierz theory with a tiny mass of graviton would reconcile locally with the General Theory of Relativity. However, the close scrutiny shows that this assertion is not correct. It took many years to understand the underlying reason of vDVZ discontinuity and its resolution in the non-linear theory. If the mass of graviton is non vanishing, irrespective of its smallness, the five degrees of freedom of graviton (mg  0) can be visualized using helicity decomposition as : two mass-less tensor degrees(corresponding to massless graviton)12 , two transverse vector degrees and a longitudinal ( massless scalar ) degree of freedom, see reviews [33, 34] for details. In the decoupling limit, relevant to local physics, the vector degrees get decoupled from matter source leaving behind two mass-less tensor degrees and a massless scalar field coupled to matter universally. The contribution of the longitudinal

11 It should be noted that the original symmetry of the Lagrangian (29), namely, (x)  (x) +  remains intact after "spontaneous
symmetry breaking", see expression, (33). 12 This can rigorously be accomplished at the level of Lagrangian.

10
degree leads to nearly doubling of the Newtonian potential giving rise to gross violation of local physics13. In the non-linear background, this contribution is taken care of by the ghost, thereby, resolution of vDVZ introduces another serious problem to be tackled. Where does the ghost come from? There are three degrees of freedom in the pictures, two of them correspond to standard massless graviton and a scalar degree of freedom. The question boils down to: how many degrees of freedom does a scalar field have? Depending on the structure of the kinetic term, the answer is as many as you like. Indeed, in case, N higher derivative terms are added to the scalar field Lagrangian with a standard kinetic term such that the Lagrangian is non-degenerate, there will be N additional ghosts dubbed Ostrogradsky ghosts. Thus in the non-linear background, we have a scalar field with higher derivative term in addition to standard kinetic term in the decoupling limit . The presence of higher derivative term allows us to locally screen out the effect of longitudinal degree of freedom leaving the local physics intact-Vainshtein mechanism14. The latter certainly resolves the vDVZ discontinuity [33, 34].
Clearly, pushing the massive gravity ideology ahead, requires the treatment of Boulware-Deser ghost. The problem was addressed in 2010 by de Rham, Gabadadze and Tolley (dRGT) [35] who designed the graviton mass term using the Galileon construction15 such that the theory is ghost free `a la dRGT. Unfortunately, FLRW cosmology is absent in this framework. The reason for the failure was attributed to the assumption that the fiducial metric16 in dRGT model was taken to be a flat spacetime metric. It was then thought to address the problem by replacing the metric by that of a non-trivial background and finally by a dynamical one using a separate action for this fiducial metric- bi-metric gravity [36]. For instance, if flat space-time is replaced by de-Sitter space-time, consistency of quantum theory of spin-2 field on this background asks for a bound on graviton mass, namely, m2g > 2H dubbed Higuchi bound otherwise theory has a ghost known as Higuchi ghost. In the case of bi-metric gravity, this bound is modified such that the mass of graviton is larger and larger at earlier times such that the Higuchi bound is difficult to be satisfied in any realistic framework. Obviously, the scenario cannot be relevant to late time acceleration which asks for mg H0.
What is narrated above, clearly tells us that gravity is very different from any other interaction that can be described by a quantum field. In this case, an attempt to address the problem at each stage gives rise to another problem. This, perhaps, tells us that either the mass of graviton is strictly zero or it is too challenging to build a consistent theory of massive gravity.
We shall not discuss the Higgs mechanism for graviton mass generation as massive gravity theories are problematic irrespective of the way we introduce the mass of graviton. However, keeping in mind the beauty of the mechanism, we hope that it will find its application in cosmology in future. In the discussion to follow, we describe the Higgs mechanism for the abelian gauge field.

demanding that the Lagrangian be invariant under the local U1 phase transformation,

13 The General Theory of Relativity is very accurate in the solar system with an accuracy of one part in 10-5. 14 Modification of gravity due the extra degree of freedom (scalar field) is locally screened out due to kinetic suppression leaving General
Theory of Relativity intact in a large radius (dubbed Vainshtein radius) around a massive body. 15 The scalar Galileon apart from the standard kinetic term contains higher derivative terms of a specific type such that the equations of
motion are still of second order, thereby no Ostrogradsky ghosts. The Galileon system has a well defined structure for a given spacetime
dimension. In dRGT, in the decoupling limit, the higher derivative terms associated with the scalar degree of freedom are of Galileon
type, thereby no ghosts in the theory. Secondly, in this case, the Vainshtein mechanism screens out the longitudinal degree of freedom
locally. 16 As we pointed out, gravity is really different from field theory. One might naively treat the space-time metric gµ as a field, the mas
term then requires that we contract the metric gµ using a fiducial metric, fµ , namely, gµ fµ as gµ gµ is constant.

Fµ = µA -  Aµ

(39)

provided that Aµ transforms as,

Aµ  Aµ = Aµ - e µ(x)

(40)

when  transforms according to (36). We have added the kinetic term for Aµ (involving Fµ) to the Lagrangian (37)17 which is invariant under (40). One can easily verify that (37) is invariant under local U1 transformation (36) subject to the gradient transformation (40) of Aµ. Indeed, let us check how the covariant derivatives Dµ and (Dµ)
transform under (36) and (40),

(Dµ)  Dµ = (µ + ieAµ)ei(x) =

= ei(x)(µ + iµ(x) + ieAµ - iµ(x)) = ei(x)Dµ

(41)

(Dµ ) = e-i(x)(Dµ).

(42)

Obviously, the covariant derivative and its complex conjugate transform exactly as  and  transform18 which
establishes the invariance of (37) under transformations (36,40) referred to as U1 gauge transformation (Aµ is known as U1 gauge field or Abelian gauge field). And we readily recognise Aµ as an electromagnetic field with gradient invariance (40).
Let us note that the potential V (||2) has the wrong mass sign as in (23). As a result, the true ground state of the
system is infinitely degenerate,

0 = vei(x),

(43)

and represents a circle of radius v in the field space. As said earlier, any point on the circle is a legitimate ground state which can be reached by applying a rotation (transformation (36)) on 0( = 0) = v with an angle 19. Thus the particular choice of the ground state, namely,  0 = v;  0 = 0, can be reached by applying a rotation on 0 in (43) with an angle - (see Fig.5) which is a symmetry of the Lagrangian (37).
It would be instructive to cast the Lagrangian (37) in (, ) form using the Euler representation for the field:  = (x)ei(x),

Let us not that (36), in the Euler representation, amounts to the following transformation,

(x)  (x) + (x)

(45)

which taking into account (40) readily tells us that Lagrangian (44) is gauge invariant as it should be. It is amazing that (x) has disappeared from dynamics altogether, it does not have a kinetic term. It only appears with Aµ in a specific combination in (44). Defining a new field,

17 Otherwise Aµ will be non-dynamical, externally given field. 18 Which clearly justifies the old nomenclature "compensating field" for Aµ. 19 Rotations in the anti-clockwise directions are taken with positive .
20 It should be kept in mind that Fµ does not change by field re-definition (46)

12

which has no memory about the  field. In variables,  and Bµ, gauge invariance does not manifest explicitly- it
is hidden but not lost as (47) is same as the gauge invariant Lagrangian (44) rewritten in different variables. If µ2 < 0, one has a unique ground state, 0 = 0 or  0 = 0 and mB = 0 and ground state respects the symmetry of the Lagrangian. However, in our case, µ2 > 0 and ground state is infinitely degenerate and by virtue of the
underlying symmetry, we have chosen one of them, namely, (28), which does not respect the underlying symmetry `a la "spontaneous symmetry breaking". The field masses in this ground state (  0 = v) are given by21,

m2

=

2V () 2 |=v

=

2µ2;

m2B |=v

= e2v2

(48)

It is miraculous that after symmetry breaking, Bµ becomes massive with mB = ev; mass is given by the vacuum expectation value of  field and the electromagnetic coupling. In this case, the field  in (37) is referred to as the Higgs field. The phenomenon of mass generation of gauge boson(s) through spontaneous symmetry breaking is known as the "Higgs mechanism". Last but not least, the information about a particular choice of the ground state or "spontaneous symmetry breaking" can be reflected in the Lagrangian by suitably shifting the field .
Let us confirm that (x) field in (44) is a pure gauge and can be removed by suitably fixing the gauge transformation. To this effect, an important remark is in order. As mentioned before, the particular choice of the ground state (28), becomes possible by applying a gauge transformation to 0 in (43),

0  0 = 0e-i(x) = v,

(49)

with an arbitrary (x). But the effect of the choice of the ground state is felt by the Lagrangian only after we shift the field. However, before doing that, let us subject the field to the same gauge transformation,

   = e-i(x) = ei((x)-(x))

(50)

Now, if we make a specific choice, (x) = (x) dubbed unitary gauge22, we have

1

Aµ  Aµ = Aµ - e µ(x);    = 

(51)

and the field (x) (would be a Goldstone boson in case of global symmetry) completely disappears from the scene in the unitary gauge and we obtain the gauge fixed Lagrangian (see expression, (44)),

(52)

which looks identical to (47) which is not surprising as it is gauge invariant. Let us recall that gauge invariance of the Lagrangian (37) allowed us to eliminate the -field as well as to choose the ground state such that  0 = v. The masses of the fields in the chosen ground state are given by,

m2

(53)

(54)

as before. An important remark about the number of independent components of Aµ is in order. When µ2 < 0, ground state of the system is unique and  0 = 0 (symmetry is not broken). In this situation, Aµ has three independent massless components. In case, of electromagnetic field (two transverse degrees of freedom), the longitudinal
components is eliminated using gauge invariance but we have already used that freedom here for knocking out (x). However, in our setting, µ2 > 0   0 = v (spontaneous symmetry breaking) and Aµ is massive. To summarize,

21 "In the case when ground state respects gauge symmetry,  0 = 0 (µ2 < 0) , the three independent components of Bµ (B0 is nondynamical, it acts like a Lagrangian multiplier (conjugate momentum corresponding to B0 vanishes) form a composite representation made up of two irreducible representations: one "massless" spin one field corresponding to two independent components of the transverse
part and a "massless" scalar field represented by the longitudinal component of the vector field Bµ. On the other hand, when the ground state violates the symmetry, µ2 > 0   0 = 0 ("spontaneous breaking of the symmetry"), as is the case here, these three independent components make one single irreducible "massive" spin one representation of the Lorentz group". We thank Romesh Kaul for this
comment. 22 Let us not that we do not have this luxury in case of global symmetry; constant  can not be identified with (x).

13

the gauge invariance makes it possible to eliminate one of the components of the complex scalar field which then reincarnates as the longitudinal component of the massive vector field after symmetry breaking23. It should also be noted that generation of vector field mass is solely related to symmetry breaking and should not be confused with gauge fixing. This is true that the choice of a particular ground state given by (28) is possible thanks to the gauge symmetry but the latter is not fixed by this choice. Indeed, the field masses can also be computed in the ground state (28) using the gauge invariant Lagrangian (52); gauge fixing for elimination of  field can be undertaken thereafter.
Let us note that the mass content of the model is not explicitly displayed by the Lagrangian (52) (or (47)) as the latter knows nothing about our choice of the ground state. As mentioned before, this information reaches the Lagrangian only after we shift the field. This is, therefore, desirable though not mandatory to accomplish the field shifting. Due to the specific choice of ground state given in (28) (  0 = v), we need to shift only  field (   + v such that vacuum expectation value vanishes for the shifted field 24. The Lagrangian (52) then acquires the following form,

(57)

which allows us to immediately read off the masses of fields given by Eqs.(53) and (54). Let us emphasize that the Lagrangian (52) is identical to Lagrangian (55) (or (57)) in physical content;  0 = v for the former whereas, s 0 = 0 after field shifting25. As said before, the Lagrangian comes to know about our choice of the ground state after field shifting. Indeed, let us recall that we had chosen the ground state (28) :  0 = 0;  0 = v. From an arbitrary point (, ) on the circle, one can reach this ground state by applying gauge transformation, 0 = ve-i(x), see Fig.5. In this case, one should work with the gauge invariant Lagrangian (44). This transformation on the field implies, (x)  (x) - (x) in (44). In this case, one needs to shift only  such that the vacuum expectation value of the shifted field vanishes which is explicit in (56). Thus the Lagrangian is well aware about the choice of ground state. Since in the unitary gauge (x) disappears, the ground state before field shifting is specified by  0 = v. By virtue of gauge invariance, it is not important from which point on the circle in Fig.5, we shift.
Let us conclude the story which begins from the gauge invariant Lagrangian (37) and ends with (52) or (55) after symmetry breaking. The gauge invariance allows us to eliminate one of the degrees of freedom associated with a complex scalar field which reappears as a longitudinal component of massive vector field in (52) or in (57). Equivalently, we could use the Lagrangian (47) where gauge invariance is not explicit. The fact that gauge invariance is hidden is related to either the choice of variables such as  and Bµ in (47) or the gauge fixing as done in the case of (52). And it should not be attributed to "spontaneous symmetry breaking". Actually, we could use the gauge invariant Lagrangian (44), for computing the field masses in the ground state (28); the Lagrangian explicitly retains the underlying symmetry after "spontaneous symmetry breaking". However, after elimination of (x) by choosing a gauge, we shall retrieve the gauge fixed Lagrangian (52) where gauge symmetry is not explicit. The ground state does not respect gauge invariance, but Lagrangian does (secretly), thus "spontaneous symmetry breaking" and gauge invariance are two different elements of the theory26.
What we have witnessed is a general feature of "spontaneous symmetry breaking" in presence of gauge fields. In case of SU(2) local symmetry, the Higgs field is represented by a complex doublet (four real components) interacting with Yang-Mills field with three massless components. Three of the four components of the complex scalar field (would be Goldstone bosons in case of global symmetry) are gobbled up by three mass-less gauge bosons after symmetry breaking, making them massive; the fourth component is the Higgs field with standard mass term. After symmetry breaking, the number of components of the Higgs field that were eliminated via gauge invariance get (effectively)

23 "Before symmetry breaking" refer to: µ2 < 0   0 = 0 and "After symmetry breaking" to: µ2 < 0   0 = v . 24 We used same notation for shifted field, it should not cause inconvenience 25 The shifted field  is different from  though we have denoted it by the same notation. Vanishing of its vacuum expectation should not
be confused with the situation when symmetry is exact. Here both the cases correspond to symmetry breaking. 26 We thank Romesh Kaul for repeated discussions on related issues.

14
attached to massive gauge bosons as their longitudinal components. It should be noted that the total number of degrees of freedom before and after "spontaneous symmetry breaking" are the same, they simply redistribute
We mentioned before that the Fermi theory, to be consistent in a high energy regime, requires three massive gauge bosons as mediators of weak interaction. However, assigning masses to them by hand destroys renormalizability of the theory. As for the generation of masses through "spontaneous symmetry breaking", it is really very tricky. Before symmetry breaking, we deal with the massless SU (2) gauge bosons interacting with Higgs field in the ()2 theory with  being a complex doublet; the framework adheres to gauge symmetry and the theory is renormalizable. Once we assume the scalar field to be with a wrong mass sign, the ground state becomes infinitely degenerate and by virtue of the gauge symmetry, we can choose any of these with non-vanishing vacuum expectation value v of the Higgs field giving rise to the generation of gauge boson masses. In this process, gauge symmetry is not lost, it remains hidden or secret and it is, therefore, not surprising that the Ward identities remain intact after "spontaneous symmetry breaking". On heuristic grounds, it implies that the theory with secret symmetry allows to consistently generate masses for gauge bosons `a la a renormalizable theory [37]27.

V. CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATION AND NON-MINIMAL COUPLING

Conformal transformation plays an important role in model building beyond Einstein gravity[17, 38] (see Ref.[39] for details on modified theories of gravity). It is believed that modified theories of gravity are equivalent to Einstein's general theory of relativity plus extra degrees of freedom. For instance, in the case of f (R) gravity, we have one extra scalar degree of freedom. Indeed, the f (R) gravity can be transformed to the Einstein frame using a conformal transformation which allows to diagonalize the Lagrangian and clearly read off the degrees of freedom. Let us consider the following action in the Jordan frame (see [40] for a discussion about physical frame),

S=

d4x

-g~

F () R~ - Z()(~ )2 - W () 2

+ Sm(g~µ , )

(58)

where F () is any coupling to curvature, Z() generalizes the Brans-Dicke action, W is a potential and  stands for matter fields. Considering the conformal transformation gµ = F ()g~µ, we obtain the action in the Einstein frame (see [41] for the transformation factors),

S=

d4x-g

R1 -

22

2Z() 3F 2 F + 2F 2

W () F2

+ Sm(gµ /F, )

(59)

We see that even in the absence of a kinetic term in the Jordan frame, Z = 0, we obtain a kinetic term in the Einstein frame because of the coupling to curvature. This situation occurs for example in f (R)-gravity models.
Thanks to a redefinition of the scalar field, we can write our action in a canonical form by defining [42]

d = F () + 2F ()2

V () = F ()2

where we reintroduced a factor MP2l. The metric gµ describes the spacetime in the Einstein frame while quantities with "tilde" refer to the Jordan frame.

and therefore a coupling to matter A() = e-/ 6. Let us emphasize that conformal transformation gives rise to simplification but it comes with a price, namely, direct
coupling of matter to the field  which was not there in the Jordan frame. In the Jordan frame,  is kinetically mixed with the metric which is removed in the Einstein frame.
Obviously, the energy-momentum tensor of matter in Jordan frame is conserved,

~ µT~µ = 0.

(65)

Due to the presence of non-minimal coupling in the Einstein frame, matter and scalar field energy-momentum tensors are not conserved separately though their sum does. Indeed, varying action (63) with respect to gµ, we have,

MP2lGµ = Tµ() + Tµ

(66)

which tells us the sum of the energy momentum tensors is conserved. The coupling would also manifest in the field equation of motion. In order to examine the conservation of individual energy momentum tensors, let us consider the following transformation,

which reduces (68) using (70) to,

(72)

Since, Tµ + Tµ should conserve in the Einstein frame, we have [16],

(73)

As mentioned before, coupling also manifests in the field equations. Indeed, varying action (63) with respect to , we find,

 = - A, T + dV  dVeff = dV - A, T

(74)

A

d d A

It should further be noted that, in the Einstein frame, the scalar field equation contains an additional term which involves direct coupling of matter with a field proportional to the trace of matter energy momentum tensor T . The latter implies that coupling would vanish for relativistic matter.
Last but not least, since energy momentum tensor transforms under conformal transformation, particle masses acquire field dependence in the Einstein frame. Keeping in mind the transformation of energy momentum tensor, T~µ = A-2Tµ, and ds~2 = A2ds2, one can easily identify the particle masses in Einstein frame from

T~µ (x) =

16

which gives

m = A()m~ ,

(76)

where particle masses, m~ are generic constants in the Jordan frame. In fact, the field dependence of mass is an important consequence of conformal transformation which implies explicit microscopic interaction of  with matter fields,

L = i¯ µµ - m()¯ 

(77)

A remark about the Dirac Lagrangian (77) is in order. For a particular choice of conformal factor, A = 1 + 2/M 2 of interest, the mass term in (77) would generate an additional, 2¯ , vortex for field .

A. Spontaneous scalarization

Symmetry breaking has been studied for a long time for compact objects under the name of spontaneous scalarization
[44, 45]. The mechanism triggers a non-zero trivial value of the scalar field near compact objects such as neutron stars which gain some hair. As we have seen (because T = A4T~)

 = -A,A3T~ + V ()

(78)

If V ( = 0) = 0 and A, = 0 or A = 0 at  = 0, we have trivially the solution  = 0 to the Klein-Gordon equation, which makes the theory equivalent to general relativity. Spontaneous scalarization occurs when this solution is
unstable and evolves to a stable solution for which  = 0. The mechanism can be simply understood by considering A = e2/2 and V () = m22/2

 = (m2 + e22 ~)

(79)

where we have assumed P~ ~ and therefore T~ = -~. Perturbing around the general relativity solution,  = 0, we obtain at the linear order of perturbations

 = (m2 + ~)

(80)

For  sufficiently negative m2 + ~ < 0 which develops a tachyonic instability evolving the scalar field away from zero. At the non-linear level, while the perturbation grows, the term e22 suppresses ( < 0) the evolution and settles it to a non-zero constant value.
Notice that in this mechanism, GR is usually recovered for low density of matter, while spontaneous scalarization produces a deviation to GR in a high density regime. A similar model has been considered in cosmology, to tackle the dark matter problem in [46], known as asymmetron. In the next sections, we will focus on the exact opposite mechanism where GR is recovered in the strong gravity regime.

B. Symmetry breaking in cosmology

Compact objects have a rich phenomenology but hereafter, we shall specialize to FLRW spacetimes,

ds2 = -dt2 + a2(t)ijdxidxj

(81)

In this background, Eqs.(72,73) acquire the following simplified form,

(82)

3H (

(83)

where, we have assumed matter to be a perfect fluid; scalar field included in action (63) also belongs to this category,

Tµ = diag(-, p, p, p); T()µ = diag(-, p, p, p)

(84)

17

Here (i, pi) refer to energy density and pressure. The scalar field equation simplifies to,

¨

3H 

=

-V,

A, A

(85)

Let us note that (83) can also be obtained from Eq.(85) multiplying it left right by . Due to coupling, matter energy density  does not conserve in Einstein frame, however, ^ = A-1 does for cold matter p = 0 and, in this case, it
would be convenient to cast the (82) in ^,

^ + 3H^ = 0

(86)

¨ + 3H = -V, - A,^.

(87)

It should be noted that ^ is independent of  which readily allows us to read off the effective potential from Eq.(87) up to an irrelevant constant,

Veff = V () + A()^

(88)

In this framework, the effect of coupling is incorporated in the expression of the effective potential. And the only thing left to us now is to make a generic choice for conformal factor A() in (88).

FIG. 6: Plot of the effective potential (94) versus the field. For ^/M 2 µ2, the ground state is given by  = 0 However, as density drops below µ2M 2, a true ground state appears which is doubly degenerate.

Notice that we have the same formalism for many other models developed in the literature, such as the chameleon mechanism [47, 48] where

or the Damour-Polyakov mechanism [49] (dilaton mechanism) which was proposed before the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe and therefore they considered a massless dilaton which decouples from matter by cosmological expansion, known as the "least coupling principle".

C. Symmetry breaking in the Universe at late times- Symmetron

After a short phase of acceleration, dubbed inflation, the Universe entered the regime of deceleration and continued in that phase before making the transition to accelerated expansion. It is plausible to think that the universe was evolving in a false vacuum with a matter density much larger than the critical energy density. In the "recent past" (around 6 billion years ago), when the former became comparable to the latter, Universe made a transition to the true ground state characterized by a de-Sitter like phase `a la "Symmetron"[11]. The model is based upon 4 theory with wrong mass sign,

V () = - 1 µ22 + 1 4

(93)

directly coupled to matter. The following choice for A() in (88) meets the set goal of the model,

2

(94)

where M is a cut off mass. The model contains two mass scales µ and M to be estimated from observational constraints.
Let us mention that to meet the underlying goal of the model, symmetry breaking should take place around the present epoch. The latter would fix µ; as for M , local gravity constraints should constrain it. In high density, ^/M 2 µ2,
coefficient of quadratic term is positive and minimum of the effective potential (94) is at   0 = 0 (  0 = 0). In this case, Z2 symmetry is exact. However, when ^ µ2M 2, the mass term in (94) acquires wrong sign giving rise to spontaneous symmetry breaking (see Fig.6) 28. Since we wish it to happen around the present epoch, we demand,

^  cr = MP2lH02

(95)

and this fixes the scale µ in terms of M ,

(96)

 we know that the field acquires a standard mass, m = 2µ around the true ground state that emerges after symmetry breaking. Acceleration in the ground state puts a restriction on field mass m or equivalently on cut off, M 29

Slow role : m H0  M MPl

(97)

If local gravity constraints fall in this range, the field would roll slowly around the ground state. It is less likely as local physics puts stringent constraints on any model with direct coupling to matter. Indeed, a necessary condition to pass local constraints is that our galaxy be screened which translates into (see next section)

Local gravity constraints : M 10-4MPl  m 104H0

(98)

which implies that the field would be rolling very fast (m H0) around the minimum of the effective potential, all the time overshooting it and the underlying ideology of symmetron gets defeated by the local gravity constraints.

D. Local gravity constraints The timelike geodesics for particles are modified in presence of the conformal coupling. We have

x¨µ + ~µx x  = 0

(99)

28 As seen from Fig.6, Veff at minimum is negative. However, this is not a question of worry as the effective potential is defined up to an
irrelevant constant and we can always lift it by adding a suitable constant to (94). 29 One of the slow roll parameters  is defined as,   MP2l(V/V )2 and in slow approximation, H2 V /3MP2l from where it follows that
m  m H0.

19

where ~ are the Christoffel symbols defined by the metric g~µ = A2gµ. Using this last relation, we have

x¨µ + µx x  + 2x µx  ln A + µ ln A = 0

(100)

where we have used x x  = -1. The second term of eq.(100) is the standard gravitational force while the two last terms correspond to the deviation to geodesics of particles which are not conformally coupled to the scalar field. Considering the non-relativistic limit, a test mass, m, will experience an additional force

F

A ()

= - ln A = -



m

(101)

This force should be screened in the regime where we have tested gravity without founding any fifth force. In order to

For simplicity, we study a static spherically symmetric problem, consisting of a central object in the Newtonian regime, characterized by a uniform constant density of matter. The exterior is assumed to be the vacuum. In this case, the fifth force reduces to -A, (r)/A, where r is the radial coordinate.

Assuming that 0 M 2/MP l which is necessary to have a fifth force similar to the Newtonian force at cosmological

scales [11] we find F/FN M 2/(MP2 l), i.e. M/MP l

F/FN . Considering that the fifth force should be screened

in the Milky Way,  10-6, and assuming a screening F/FN < 10-2, we get M < 10-4MP l.

20
We see therefore, a limitation of such a form of screening, shared also with the chameleon mechanism. We saw that F/FN 20/(M 2) and therefore a bound on the fifth force, implies a bound on the cosmological value of the field fixed by the Newtonian potential of a local object such as the Milky Way. As a consequence, these models have little impact on very large scales as was proved in this no-go theorem [50]. Because the cosmological field is related to local constraints, the Compton wavelength of such a scalar can be at most Mpc and therefore the deviation from the CDM background cosmology is negligible at large scales. The accelerated expansion would be due mostly from a varying conformal factor. Nonetheless, this mechanism remains interesting at small scales where deviations from the standard model can be large.
For example, it was shown [51] that the potential governing the dynamics of the matter fields can differ from the lensing potential, and therefore providing a distinctive signature. This effect is stronger in this model as in f (R)gravity. Therefore it is also peculiar to a particular model and not necessarily shared by all modified gravity models. Also the model exhibits interesting stable topological defects [52, 53].
E. Coupling to neutrino matter
Despite the grand success of the hot big bang, namely, the prediction of an expanding universe, nucleosynthesis and microwave background radiation, the model is plagued with several inconsistencies. One of these related to the age of the Universe should be addressed by late time evolution. The only way to circumvent the problem in the standard lore is provided by invoking late time acceleration. The latter slows down the Hubble expansion rate at late stages such that it takes more time to reach the present day value of the Hubble parameter implying a resolution of the age puzzle. The phenomenon has been confirmed by direct and indirect observations in recent years. On theoretical grounds, adhering to Einstein's general theory of relativity, cosmic acceleration asks for the presence of an exotic matter repulsive in nature. The mass scale associated with dark energy is O(10-3) eV. Late time cosmic acceleration is an observed reality, but what causes it is a mystery. It is tempting to think whether there is a distinguished physical process in the late Universe with a characteristic mass scale around the mass scale associated with dark energy. And this reminds us about the relic neutrinos. In the Leptonic Era, neutrinos were in thermal equilibrium with the other particles that made up the primordial plasma, namely, photons, electrons, positrons and nucleons. When the temperature dropped to about one MeV, the Universe was about one second old, neutrinos then decoupled from the rest species, and since then they are just expanding with expansion with the number density of the order of that of photons in the Universe today. Their masses are typically O(10-1 - 10-2) eV allowing them to turn non-relativistic around the present epoch. This is what we are looking for, namely, a physical process in the late universe with a characteristic mass scale of interest to dark energy. In what follows, we shall address the question: can neutrinos be important to the late time cosmic acceleration? Keeping in mind the formulated agenda, let us consider the following

where , p and  represent the energy density, pressure and equation of state parameter for massive neutrino matter. At early times, neutrino matter is relativistic ( = 1/3) and RHS of Eqs.(110) and (111) vanishes. In this case, coupling gradually builds up at late times, see Fig.8. As neutrinos turn non-relativistic around the present
epoch, massive neutrino matter mimics cold matter( = 0). In this case, it is again convenient as before to work in terms of ^ = A-1 ,

^ + 3H^ = 0 ,

(112)

and the field evolution takes the form,

¨ + 3H = -V, - A,^  Veff = V () + A()^

(113)

where ^ refers to neutrino matter density today. To realize spontaneous symmetry breaking, we shall use massless 4 theory. The choice of the coupling is dictated by the phenomenological considerations keeping in mind the Z2
symmetry,

(114)

where  is a constant30 to be fixed using observational constraints or some additional requirement ( sets the cutoff scale, M 2  -1MP2l in Eq.(114)). Using Eqs.(113,114), we then obtain effective potential,

Veff

(115)

In absence of coupling (at early stages of evolution), the effective potential (115) has minimum at  = 0 as usual which is no longer the case at late times when coupling builds up dynamically. In this case, mass term has a wrong sign and the true minima are now given by,

min = ±

 

^ MP2l

.

(116)

We should now repeat the process we carried earlier, namely, choose one of the minima as the ground state, and execute shifting of the field. The latter breaks the original symmetry of the Lagrangian. After that the mass square of the field is given by 2 times minus the coefficient of the quadratic term in (115),

(117)

Since our goal is to have spontaneous symmetry breaking around the present epoch, we would demand that mass of the field in the true ground state be of the order of H0,

m2 = 6(0)H02 , Eq.(118) tells us that, not much fine tuning is required for  to achieve slow roll around the true minimum,

(120)

Such a small numerical value of self coupling might be a problem if we decide to couple the field to any other matter field. We shall come back to this point later. Secondly, it might look awkward that Vmin < 0; it is, however, not problematic as the effective potential (115) is defined up to an irrelevant constant and we can always lift it appropriately,

(121)

We refer back to the symmetron scenario where the scalar field mass in the true ground state is much larger than H0 ( about 104H0) and therefore the field keeps oscillating around the minimum and never settles there. In our case, the mass being of the order of H0, the field should roll slowly around the minimum. Expanding the effective potential in the small  neighbourhood around the minimum, we have,

FIG. 8: Figure displays the numerically estimated effective equation of state weff versus the redshift ( = 10-123 and m = 10-2eV ) in agreement with our analytical claim that field ultimately settles in the minimum after symmetry breaking.

The validity of slow roll can be checked by using the following relation,

Taking into account the observed numerical value of the equation of state parameter , we find that,  0.7MPl which tells us the slow is consistent with the approximation used in (122)31. Thus, the field rolls slowly around the
ground state which is not surprising as the mass of the field is of the order of H0, see Fig.8. Before closing the review, let us comment on the stability of self coupling , in case,  couples to any other field.
Strictly speaking, with  being a singlet, we can not generate any coupling similar to the standard model. The only
microscopic coupling of scalar field with neutrino field gets generated due to field dependence of neutrino masses,

L = i¯  µµ - m ()¯  

(124)

where m() = [1 - (2/2MP2l)2]m~ ; with m~  being the neutrino mass in the Jordan, a generic constant. The latter generates an additional interaction in the Einstein frame,

where c is UV cut off. Since, for the generic cut of c  MPl(   10-2, m~   10-2eV ) the correction   10-62 is much larger than . Thus the self coupling gets destabilized by the radiative correction. The phenomenon is similar
to the quadratic divergence caused by the interaction of the fundamental scalar field with the Fermion field. It should, however, be mentioned that such a coupling is absent in the framework under consideration32.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
This review describes the efforts made by cosmologists to obtain late time acceleration from spontaneous symmetry breaking in the Universe. In this paradigm, late time transition from deceleration to acceleration is thought to be the result of a phase transition. Spontaneous symmetry breaking serves as the foundation of Unification of interactions and it is therefore plausible to think that it might also work in cosmology. This idea is essentially inspired by thermodynamic theory of phase transitions. To this effect, we have briefly reviewed the Ginzburg-Landau theory of second order phase transitions. We clearly show that such a phenomenon can not be realized in quantum mechanics- in this case, the classical degeneracy of the ground state gets lifted by quantum tunnelling whose probability can be estimated using the instanton solutions. We then mention that tunnelling probability exponentially vanishes in an infinite system such as field theory. The heuristic argument is supported by the fact that there exists no instanton solution in scalar field theory with multiple vacua.
As a first example from field theory, we consider the 4 theory with Z2 symmetry but with wrong mass sign in the potential. In this case, we have two symmetric minima and choosing one of them breaks the symmetry of the Lagrangian. Shifting the field to new configuration with zero vacuum expectation value corrects the sign of mass term for the shifted field. This follows the discussion of complex scalar field with U1 global continuous symmetry, again with the wrong mass sign. In this case, the vacuum state is infinitely degenerate; the vacuum manifold is a circle. After symmetry breaking, one of the components of the scalar field has standard mass as in case of Z2 symmetry breaking but the other component is a massless Goldstone boson. Miracle happens, if we consider the same problem in the presence of an electromagnetic field known as U1 gauge symmetry. After "spontaneous symmetry breaking", the Goldstone boson gets gobbled up by the mass-less vector field turning it massive such that the degrees of freedom in the model are same before and after symmetry breaking. We should mention that this is a general feature of any gauge theory with symmetry breaking.
After the pedagogical introduction to "spontaneous symmetry breaking", we get to the description of the first model of symmetry breaking in the Universe known as "symmetron". This model is based upon the 4 theory with the wrong mass sign as before and with direct coupling of  to cold matter. Such a coupling can be generated using a conformal transformation from Jordan to Einstein frame. We describe conformal transformation in detail to show that the coupling is proportional to the trace of matter energy momentum tensor, Tm. In this case, coupling reduces to modifying the field potential which does facilitate symmetry breaking in the low density regime whereas in the high density regime, Z2 symmetry is exact. Model has two parameters µ and M to be fixed from observation. The first parameter gets gracefully fixed by demanding that symmetry breaking takes place when matter density drops below the critical density. As for the cut off mass M , it should be such that the field rolls slowly around the

true ground state, i.e., m H0 (m being the field mass about the true minimum) that emerges after symmetry breaking. While studying direct coupling to cold matter, the most stringent restrictions on models are imposed by local gravity constraints which, in the case of "symmetron", imply that, m H0. As a result, the field never settles in the ground state to mimic de-Sitter-like solution of interest to late time acceleration; field keeps overshooting the potential minimum. Thereby, the beautiful model gets killed by local gravity constraints which play a crucial role for testing models based upon direct coupling to matter. Keeping this in mind, we have included a sub-section dealing with local gravity constraints which, in particular, give rise to the bound on the field mass, in the symmetron model.
Finally, we review a model based upon  coupling to massive neutrino matter proportional to T. By virtue of their small masses, massive neutrinos are relativistic at early times and coupling vanishes. Coupling automatically builds up at late stages as neutrinos turn non-relativistic. Let us mention that local gravity constraints do not apply to neutrino matter. In this case, mass of field, after symmetry breaking, gets naturally connected to neutrino masses such that m  (0)H0 ( fixes the cut off mass scale in our case) thereby, with little adjustment of , one can achieve the desired bound on m, namely, m H0 or slow roll around the true ground state, evading "NO GO" to late acceleration faced by the symmetron model, see Fig.8. The distinguished and generic feature of this proposal is related to the physical process of turning massive neutrinos to non-relativistic at late times which triggers the breaking of Z2 symmetry in the low density regime.
