## Abstract

How does the control power of corporate top1 shareholder arise? On the fundamental economics principle, we discover that the probability of top1 shareholder possessing optimal control power evolves in Fibonacci series pattern and emerges as a wave between 0.500 and 0.667 along with time in period of 12h (h is the time distance between the state and state of the evolution). This novel feature suggests the efficiency of the allocation of corporate shareholders'right and power. Data on the Chinese stock market support this prediction.
