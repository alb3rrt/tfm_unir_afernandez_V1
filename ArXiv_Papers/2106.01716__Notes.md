## Abstract

A quantum effect at ambient conditions is presented. A benzene dithiol (BDT) molecule or a tetra hydro furan (THF) molecule is used as a barrier molecule bridging the gold electrodes from a Mechanically Controllable Break junction. It has been known for a long time that the environment of a junction couples to the conduction. With a microscopic layer of fluid it is actually possible to influence this coupling. The electrode-molecule-electrode configuration is lined with a microscopic layer of THF fluid, also known as the partially wet phase. This is effectively decoupling the electrode-molecule-electrode system from environmental modes outside of this system. The effects on coherence and quantum interference are exceptional.
