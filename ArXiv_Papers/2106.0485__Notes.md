## Abstract

We present a robust a posteriori error estimator for the weak Galerkin finite element method applied to stationary convection-diffusion equations in the convection-dominated regime. The estimator provides global upper and lower bounds of the error %measured in a suitable norm and is robust in the sense that upper and lower bounds are uniformly bounded with respect to the diffusion coefficient. Results of the numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the performance of the error estimator.
