## Abstract

Four-boson Efimov physics is well known in the negative energy regime but far less above the four-body breakup threshold. The part of this region with negative two-boson scattering length is studied solving rigorous four-particle scattering equations for transition operators in the momentum space. Moving away from the unitary limit the Efimov tetramers evolve from unstable bound states into resonances. Their energies and widths are studied as functions of the two-boson scattering length; a universal behavior is established and given in a dimensionless representation. The Efimov tetramers have finite width in the whole regime; they broaden rapidly in the resonance regime but remain narrower than the associated trimer. The resonant behavior is most clearly seen in the four-particle recombination rate.
