## Abstract

Embedding in the environment, initialization and readout are achieved by tunnel-coupling the quansistor to leads. The external leads are explicitly considered and are assumed to be the main source of decoherence. We show that quansistors can be dynamically decoupled from the leads by tuning their internal parameters, giving them the versatility required to act as controllable quantum memory units. With this dynamical decoupling, logical operations within quansistors are also symmetry-protected from unbiased noise in their parameters. We identify technologies that could implement $\omega$-rotation invariance. Many of our results can be generalized to higher-level $\omega$-rotation-invariant systems, or adapted to clusters with other symmetries.
