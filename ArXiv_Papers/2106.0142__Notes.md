## Abstract

The growing use of social media has led to drastic changes in our decision-making. Especially, Facebook offers marketing API which promotes business to target potential groups who are likely to consume their items. However, this service can be abused by malicious advertisers who attempt to deceive people by disinformation such as propaganda and divisive opinion. To counter this problem, we introduce a new application named FBAdTracker. The purpose of this application is to provide an integrated data collection and analysis system for current research on fact-checking related to Facebook advertisements. Our system is capable of monitoring up-to-date Facebook ads and analyzing ads retrieved from Facebook Ads Library.
