## Abstract

We review the derivation of the pulsations equations for spherically symmetric boson stars and then make a thorough study of the radial oscillation frequencies for the fundamental and first excited modes. We do this for self-interacting boson stars and consider a range of values for the self-coupling constant. We also numerically evolve boson stars and Fourier transform the dynamic solutions. The Fourier transform gives an independent computation of the radial oscillation frequencies and allows us to verify our results obtained from the pulsation equations. We find excellent agreement between the two methods.
