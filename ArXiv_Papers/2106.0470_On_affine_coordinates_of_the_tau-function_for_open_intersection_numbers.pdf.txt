ON AFFINE COORDINATES OF THE TAU-FUNCTION FOR OPEN INTERSECTION NUMBERS
ZHIYUAN WANG
Abstract. In Alexandrov's work [5, 6] it has been shown that the extended partition function exp(F o,ext + F c) introduced by Buryak in [13, 14] is a taufunction of the KP hierarchy. In this work, we compute the affine coordinates of this tau-function on the Sato Grassmannian using the fermionic reformulation of the Virasoro constraints. As applications we derive some formulas for this partition function and the n-point functions of its free energy using methods developed by Zhou in [43].

1. Introduction

Integrable hierarchies have become one of the central topics in the study of mirror symmetry. It begins with the famous Witten Conjecture/Kontsevich Theorem [31, 42], which asserts that the generating series of intersections of -classes on the moduli spaces Mg,n of stable curves is a tau-function  WK of the KdV hierarchy. It is well-known that the KP hierarchy is a more general integrable system, and the KdV hierarchy is a reduction of the KP hierarchy, see eg. [16, 26].
In Kyoto School's approach to the KP hierarchy, there are three equivalent descriptions of a tau-function (see [16, 36]):

1) An element in the Sato Grassmannian; 2) A vector in the fermionic Fock space F ; 3) A vector in the bosonic Fock space B.

In particular, given an element U  Gr(0) in the big cell of the Sato Grassmannian, one can associate vectors in the two Fock spaces:

(1)

U  Gr(0)  |U  F (0)  U  ,

where F (0)  F is the subspace consisting of vectors of charge 0, and   B is the space of symmetric functions. The second step |U  U is the so-called boson-fermion correspondence.
One of the ways to describe the first step U  |U is to use Bogoliubov transformations. This idea was first inspired by the ADKMV conjecture [2, 3], which gives a simple expression for the topological vertex as a Bogoliubov transform on the 3-component fermionic Fock space. See [18, 19] for a generalization of this conjecture and the proofs for the one-legged and two-legged cases. In [45], Zhou found an explicit formula for the Witten-Kontsevich tau-function  WK as a Bogoliubov transform of the fermionic vacuum. His method is to rewrite the Virasoro constraints for  WK (see [21, 23]) in terms of the fermions, and then derive recursion relations for the coefficients of the Bogoliubov transformation. The explicit formulas of the coefficients are rather complicated, but can be interpreted in a nice way, due to Balogh and Yang [9]. They found that these coefficients are the affine coordinates for the

tau-function  WK on the Sato Grassmannian. Later in [43], Zhou generalized this idea to the case of an arbitrary tau-function of the KP hierarchy, and proposed a framework called emergent geometry. See [47, 48] for the computations of the affine coordinates of some other well-known tau-functions in mathematical physics, including the enumeration of Grothendieck's dessin d'enfants, the Hermitian onematrix models, and the BGW model. In these examples, one can write down an explicit formula for the tau-function as a Bogoliubov transform in the fermionic picture, while finding an explicit formula in the bosonic picture seems difficult.
It is shown in [43] that for each tau-function  of the KP hierarchy, there is a unique way to represent it as a Bogoliubov transform of the fermionic vacuum:

 = exp

an,m

-m-

1 2

- n-

|0 ,

n,m0

where {an,m}n,m0 are the affine coordinates for  on the Sato Grassmannian, and

-m-

,

- n-

1 2

are the

fermionic

creators (for

n, m



0).

This

representation of



in

the fermionic Fock space allows us to translate some constraints for a tau-function

into the fermionic picture. It is well-known that on the Sato Grassmannian, a

good way to select a particular tau-function is to use the Kac-Schwarz operator

(see [28, 37]); and in the bosonic picture, one has some differential equations (such

as the string equation, Virasoro constraints, etc.) to select a tau-function. Now in

the fermionic Fock space, a way to select a tau-function will be certain recursion

relations or constraints for its affine coordinates {an,m}n,m0. In this work, let us study the case of the open intersection numbers, developed

by Pandharipande, Solomon, and Tessler in [35]. This is the open analog of the

Witten conjecture. In that work, those authors investigated the intersection the-

ory on the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces with boundary. They constructed

rigorously the moduli spaces and open intersection numbers in genus zero, and con-

jectured that the all-genera generating function is uniquely determined by the open

Virasoro constraints and a family of differential equations called the open KdV

hierarchy. In [13], Buryak proved that the open KdV is equivalent to the open

Virasoro constraints for this conjectural all-genera intersection theory, and there is

a unique solution F o (called the open potential) to these constraints specified by

a certain initial condition. Moreover, he constructed an extended open potential

F o,ext to include the descendants on the boundary, and the Virasoro constraints

for the extended generating function

(2)

 o := exp(F o,ext + F c)

was derived in [14], where F c = log  WK is the free energy of the Witten-Kontsevich tau-function. He also discussed some relations between F o and F c. In [5,6], Alexandrov found that the extended generating function  o is the special case N = 1 of a
family of Kontsevich-Penner matrix integral N , while another special case N = 0
gives the Witten-Kontsevich tau-function. Moreover, he showed that N is a tau-
function of the KP hierarchy, and constructed an admissible basis (denoted by Ni in [5], expressed in terms of some formal integrals) on the Sato Grassmannian together with a Kac-Schwarz operator for N . The Virasoro constraints and W-
constraints for N were also constructed in his works. See Buryak-Tessler [15] for a

proof of the conjecture of [35] (where the construction of the higher genus intersec-
tion theory was announced by Solomon and Tessler, see also [41]). For more about the open intersection theory, see [4, 7, 8, 10Г12, 29, 32, 39, 40].
Our method to compute the affine coordinates of the tau-function  o is to reformulate the Virasoro constraints for  o in terms of fermionic operators and then derive recursions for the affine coordinates, following the strategy developed in [45,48].
The result is (see Theorem 3.1):

Theorem 1.1. The affine coordinates {aon,m}n,m0 for the tau-function  o are:

(3)

ao0,3q-1 =

3 2

q и (2q - 1)!! и

q

54j

и

(6j - (2j)! и

1)!! (2j -

1)!!

,

j=0

and for every p  0 and q  1,

ao3p+1,3q-2 = aW 3pK,3q-1,

(4)

ao3p+2,3q-3 = aW 3pK+1,3q-2,

ao3p+3,3q-1 = aW 3pK+2,3q - ao0,3q-1 и aW 3pK+2,0,

where {aW n,mK}n,m0 are the affine coordinates of the Witten-Kontsevich tau-function whose explicit formulas have been computed by Zhou in [45] (see (36) for the formulas). Moreover, we have aon,m = 0 for n + m  -1(mod 3).

We will show that the fermionic reformulation of the Virasoro constraints for  o is the following recursions and constraints for the affine coordinates (see Д3.4):

Theorem 1.2. For every n  -1, the affine coordinates {aon,m}n,m0 for the taufunction  o satisfy:

1) A (2n + 3)-step recursion relation:

aol,2n+3+m-ao2n+3+l,m

=

k=0

Here we denote aon,m := 0 for n < 0 or m < 0.

As a corollary, using the methods developed in [43], we will have a fermionic representation of  o as a Bogoliubov transform of the fermionic vacuum:

(5)

 o = exp(Ao)|0 ,

where Ao is a quadratic operator of the fermionic creators:

Ao =

aon,m

-m-

1 2

- n-

.

n,m0

This leads to a formula in the bosonic picture in terms of Schur functions:

(6)

o = 1 +

(-1)n1+иии+nk и det(aoni,mj )1i,jk и sх,

х: |х|>0

4

ZHIYUAN WANG

where х = (m1, и и и , mk|n1, и и и , nk) is the Frobenius notation of a partition х. See Д4.1-Д4.2 for details.
Furthermore, we compute the generating series

Ao(x, y) :=

aon,m x-n-1 y -m-1

n,m0

of the affine coordinates for  o, and prove (see Д4.3):

Theorem 1.3. We have:

(7)

Ao(x, y)

=

c(y)a(-x) x

y x

a(y)b(-x) y2

,

where a(z), b(z) are the Faber-Zagier series:

a(z) =



(6m - 1)!! 36m и (2m)!

m=0

b(z) = -



(6m - 1)!! 36m и (2m)!

and c(z) is the generating series of {ao0,m}m0:

c(z) =

m

54j

и

(6j - 1)!! (2j)! и (2j -

z-3m.

j=0

Having this generating function, we are able to compute the n-point functions of the free energies log( o) and F o,ext using a formula derived by Zhou in [43]. See
Д4.3-Д4.7 for details of the computations. In particular, the one-point function of F o,ext is given by the following formula (see Д4.5 for details):

F o,ext j1 Tj

и z-j-1 =
T =0

c(z)a(-z) z

-

.

And the two-point function is given by (see Д4.6):

2F o,ext j,k1 TjTk

T

и

x-j -1 y -k-1

=

-

a(-x)a(-y)c(x)c(y) xy

+

1 y(x2 -

y2)

a(-x)a(-y)b(x)c(y) - a(x)a(-x)b(-y)c(y)

.

See also Д4.7 for a similar but more complicated formula for the 3-point function. It will be interesting to compare these formulas with the formulas for the n-point functions derived by Bertola-Ruzza in [10] using a different method.
Another question is to compute the affine coordinates of the partition function N for the Kontsevich-Penner model (see [5]) for general N , and we hope to address this problem in future works. It is also interesting to discuss the emergent geometry for  o and N following the methods developed in [43, 46, 49], and this will fit into the general picture listed in [48, p.5] which describes the dualities among various theories whose partition functions are all tau-functions of the KP hierarchy.
The rest of this paper is arranged as follows. In Д2 we recall some preliminaries of Kyoto School's approach to the KP hierarchy. In Д3 we state our main results on the affine coordinates of the tau-function  o. The proofs of these results will be given in 5, where we derive a fermionic description of the Virasoro constraints for  o. In

Д4 we give some applications of the main theorem, including the computations of  o and log( o) using the affine coordinates.

2. Preliminaries of KP Hierarchy and Sato's Theory
Let us recall some basic knowledge of Kyoto School's approach to the KP hierarchy in this section. In particular, we describe the constructions in (1).

2.1. Partitions of integers, Young diagrams, and Schur functions. First let us recall the notion of Schur functions. See [33] for an introduction.
First recall that a partition of a positive integer n is a sequence of positive integers  = (1, 2, и и и , l) such that 1  и и и  l > 0 and || := 1 + и и и + l = n. The number l is called the length of the partition , denoted by l().
There is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all partitions and the set of Young diagrams. Given a partition  = (1, и и и , l), we associate a Young diagram consisting of || boxes, such that there are i boxes on the i-th row. For example, all the partitions of 4 and their associated Young diagrams are:

(4)

(3, 1) (2, 2) (2, 1, 1) (1, 1, 1, 1)

The dotted lines above are called the diagonal of the Young diagram. Given a partition  = (1, и и и , l), denote by t = (t1, и и и , tm) its transpose (obtained by flipping the Young diagram along the diagonal), then clearly m = 1, and (t)t = . For example, from the above expressions one easily sees that:

(4)t = (1, 1, 1, 1), (3, 1)t = (2, 1, 1), (2, 2)t = (2, 2).

The Frobenius notation of a partition  is define to be:

 = (m1, m2, и и и , mk|n1, n2, и и и , nk),
where k is the number of boxes on the diagonal of the associated Young diagram, and mi := i - i, ni := ti - i.
Now let us recall the definition of Schur functions s where  is a partition. First for the special case  = (m|n), define:

(8)

s(m|n) = hm+1en - hm+2en-1 + и и и + (-1)nhm+n+1,

where hn and en are the complete symmetric function and elementary symmetric function of degree n respectively:

hn(y) :=

y1d1 y2d2 y3d3 и и и ,

i di=n

en(y) :=

yi1 и и и yin .

i1 <иии<in

Now let  = (m1, и и и , mk|n1, и и и , nk). Then the Schur function s labeled by  = (m1, и и и , mk|n1, и и и , nk) is defined to be:

(9)

s = det(s(mi|nj))1i,jk .

Let  be the space of all symmetric functions, then all Schur functions {s} form a basis for  (here s(0) := 1).

6

Remark 2.1. Schur functions are related to the Newton symmetric functions by the Frobenius formula (see eg. [33]):

pх = хs,

where pх := pх1 и и и pхk for х = (х1, и и и , хk) and pn(y) := i yin. Here х are the characters of irreducible representations of the symmetric group Sn (see eg. [24]).

2.2. Semi-infinite wedge products and the fermionic Fock space. Now let

us recall the construction of the fermionic Fock space F via semi-infinite wedge

product, and the action of a Clifford algebra on F .

Let

a

=

(a1, a2, и и и )

be

a

sequence

of

half-integers

in

Z+

1 2

,

satisfying

the

condition a1 < a2 < и и и . We say a is admissible if:

(Z0

+

1 2

)

-

{a1,

a2

и

ии

}

< ,

{a1,

a2

и

и

и

}

-

(Z0

+

1 2

)

< .

Given such an a, one can associate a semi-infinite wedge product |a by:

|a := za1  za2  za3  и и и

Then the fermionic Fock space F is the space of expressions of the following form:

ca|a ,

a

where the summation is taken over admissible sequences. Assume |a  F . The charge of the vector |a is defined to be the number:

charge(|a ) :=

(Z0

+

1 2

)

-

{a1,

a2

ии

и

}

-

{a1,

a2

и

и

и

}

-

(Z0

+

1 2

)

,

and this gives us a decomposition of the fermionic Fock space:

(10)

F = F (n),

nZ

where F (n) is spanned by vectors |a of charge n. Let us denote:

|n

:=

z

n+

1 2



zn+

3 2



zn+

5 2

иии



F (n).

In particular, the vector |0

:=

z1 2



z

3 2



z

5 2

 иии



F (0)

is

called

the

fermionic

vacuum vector.

The space F (0) has a basis labeled by partitions of integers. Let х = (х1, х2, и и и ) be a partition such that х1  х2  и и и  хl > хl+1 = хl+2 = и и и = 0, and denote:

|х

:=

z1 2

-х1



z

3 2

-х2



z

5 2

-х3



и

и

и



F (0),

then {|х } form a basis for F (0). In particular, (0, 0, и и и ) is a partition of 0  Z,

and the corresponding vector is |0  F (0).

Now let space. Let

us recall the action

{r

,

r

}rZ+

1 2

be a

of

fermions

r ,

(r

+

set of generators of a Clifford

on the fermionic Fock algebra, satisfying the

anti-commutation relations:

(11)

[r, s]+ = 0,

[r, s]+ = 0,

[r, s]+ = r+s,0 и id,

where the bracket is defined by [, ]+ :=  + . Then the Clifford algebra acts on the fermionic Fock space F by:

r|a := zr  |a ,

r



Z

+

1 2

,

AFFINE COORDINATES FOR OPEN INTERSECTION NUMBERS

7

and

r|a :=

(-1)k+1 и za1  za2  и и и  zak  и и и , 0,

if ak = -r for some k; otherwise.

It is clear that {r} all have charge -1, and {r} all have charge 1. The operators {r, r}r<0 are called the fermionic creators, and {r, r}r>0 are called the fermionic annihilators. One can check that:

(12)

r|0 = 0, r|0 = 0, r > 0.

Moreover, every element of the form |х (where х is a partition) can be obtained by applying fermionic creators to the vacuum |0 in the following way:

(13)

|х

=

(-1)n1 +иии+nk

и

-m1-

1 2

- n1-

1 2

и

и

и

-mk

-

1 2

- nk

-

1 2

|0

,

if the Frobenius notation for х = (х1, х2, и и и ) is х = (m1, и и и , mk|n1, и и и , nk). Furthermore, one can define an inner product (и, и) on the Fock space F by taking
{|a |a is admissible} to be an orthonormal basis. Given two admissible sequences
a and b, we denote by b|a := (|a , |b ) the inner product of |a and |b . It is easy to see that r and - r are adjoint to each other with respect to this inner product.

2.3. Affine coordinates on the big cell of the Sato Grassmannian. In this
subsection we recall the construction of the big cell Gr(0) of the Sato Grassmannian and the affine coordinates on it. Then we recall how to associate a vector in the fermionic Fock space F (0)  F to each element of Gr(0) by Bogoliubov transformations.
Let H be the infinite-dimensional vector space:

H := formal series

an = 0 for n >> 0

nZ

Then

H

=

H+  H-,

where

H+

and

H-

Denote by

▒ : H  H▒ the natural projections. The big cell Gr(0) of the Sato Grassmannian

consists of linear subspaces U  H such that the + : U  H+ is an isomorphism.

Given an element U  Gr(0), a basis of the form:

(14)

f~n

a~n,j

is called an admissible basis. Among various admissible basis for U , there is a unique one of the following form (see eg. [9] or [43, Д3]):

(15)

called the normalized basis for U . The coefficients {an,m}n,m0 of this normalized basis are called the affine coordinates of U on Gr(0). This basis determines a semiinfinite wedge product:

where m1 > m2 > и и и > mk  0 and n1 > n2 > и и и > nk  0 are two sequences of

integers, and the coefficients are given by:

.

ank,m1 и и и ank,mk

Thus we get a linear map:

(16) Gr(0)  F (0), U = span{f0, f1, f2 и и и }  |U := f0  f1  f2  и и и , where {fn}n0 is the normalized basis for U . Moreover, one has:

Theorem 2.1 ( [43]). Let {an,m}n,m0 be the affine coordinates of U  Gr(0). Then |U  F (0) is equal to the following Bogoliubov transform:

|U = eA|0 ,

where A : F (0)  F (0) is defined by:

(17)

A :=

an,m-m-

1 2

- n-

1 2

.

n,m0

The following property will be useful in practical computations. Let A be defined

by

(17),

then

r > 0,

(19)

e-AreA =

This property can be check by using:

r < 0; r > 0.

e-AeA

where  denotes some r or r. One can compute the right-hand side term by term, and get:

[A, r] =

m,n0

and thus:

[A, r] =

m0

ar-

1 2

,

0,

r > 0, r < 0.

Then

one

easily

sees

that

[A,

[A,

=

for

every

1 2

,

and

thus

(18)

follows.

And (19) can be similarly proved.

Now let |U  F (0) be a state in the fermionic Fock space constructed from an

element U  Gr(0), then using the properties (18), (19) one can easily prove that

the following Hirota bilinear relation holds (see eg. [43, Д4.2] for details):

r|U  -r|U = 0.

2.4. The boson-fermion correspondence. We recall the bosonic Fock space and boson-fermion correspondence in this subsection. See [16].
Define n to be the following operators on the fermionic Fock space F :

n =

: -rr+n :,

rZ+

1 2

n  Z,

where : -rr+n : is the normal-ordered product of fermions, defined by:

(21)

: r1 r2 и и и rn := (-1)r(1) r(2) и и и r(3) ,

where k denotes either k or k for simplicity, and   Sn is a permutation such that (1)  и и и  (n). For n = 0, the operator 0 is the charge operator on F .
The operators {n}nZ satisfy the following commutation relations:

[m, n] = mm+n,0 и id,

i.e., they generate a Heisenberg algebra. One can also check that:

[n, r] = n+r,

[n, r] = -n+r.

The normal-ordered products for the bosons {n}nZ are defined by:

(22)

: n1 n2 :=   , n(1) n(2)

where   S2 such that (1)  (2). Then the above commutation relations and the anti-commutation relations (11) are equivalent to the following operator product expansions (see eg. [20, 27] for some basics of OPEs):

symmetric functions, and w is a formal variable. The boson-fermion correspondence is a linear isomorphism  : F  B of vector spaces, given by:

:

10

where pn (n  1) is the Newton symmetric function of degree n. In particular, restricting to F (0) we get an isomorphism ( [16, Д5]):

(25)

F (0)  ,

|х  sх = 0|e

|х ,

where sх is the Schur function labelled by the partition х. Using the above isomorphism, one can rewrite the bosons n and fermions r, r
as operators on the bosonic Fock space. The results are as follows:

(26)

(n|a ) =

n

 pn

(|a

),

p-n и (|a ),

n > 0; n < 0,

and: (()|a ) = ()(|a ),

(()|a ) = ()(|a ),

where (), () are the vertex operators:

and the actions of eK and 0 are defined by:

(eK f )(z, T ) = z и f (z, T ),

(0 f )(z, T ) = f (z, T ).

2.5. Sato's construction of tau-functions. Now let us recall Sato's theory [36] of the KP hierarchy. See also Segal-Wilson [38] for an analytic construction.
In Sato's theory, the space of all (formal power series) tau-functions is the same as a semi-infinite Grassmannian Gr, which is an orbit of the trivial solution  = 1
under the action of the infinite-dimensional Lie group GL(). In particular, given U  Gr(0)  Gr, the function

U (x) := 0|e |U n1 xnn

constructed above is a (formal power series) tau-function of the KP hierarchy with respect to time variables x = (x1, x2, и и и ).
Moreover, the bilinear relation (20) is equivalent to the following Hirota bilinear equation for the tau-function (see [16]):

0=

(xj - yj )zj

),

for every x = (x1, x2, и и и ) and y = (y1, y2, и и и ). A function  =  (x) is a taufunction of the KP hierarchy if and only if it satisfies the above identity.
Since F (0) has a basis {|х } labelled by partitions of non-negative integers, there

exists coefficients cх(U ) such that |U = х cх(U ) и |х , and then the tau-function can be represented as a summation of Schur functions:

(28)

U (x) = cх(U )sх,

х

where

xn

=

pn n

.

The

The wave-function and dual wave-function associated to the tau-function U are defined by:

(29)

w(x; z) := -1|e n1 xnn (z)|U /U , w(x; z) := 1|e n1 xnn (z)|U /U ,

respectively. They are related to the tau-function by Sato's formulas:

(30)

w(x; z) = exp

xn z n

(x - [z-1]) U (x)

w(x; z) = exp

])

.

where

[z-1]

denotes

the

sequence

(z-1,

z-2 2

,

,

и

и

и

).

Then the Hirota bilinear

equation (27) can be rewritten as:

Resz= w(x; z)w(x; z) = 0,

for arbitrary x and x. The above construction can also be reversed. If  (x) is a tau-function of the
KP hierarchy, then there is an element U  Gr(0) in the big cell of the Sato Grassmannian such that  = U . The way to find U is the following (see [1]):

(31)

U = span

where x := x1 and w(x; z) is the dual wave function determined by (30). Notice that this result has been presented in different notations by different

authors, and in some literatures one uses the wave function w(x; z) instead of the

dual wave function w(x; z). Here let us describe both results using wave and

dual wave functions in the notations we picked above (for a proof, see eg. the

computations in [43, Д4.5]):

Lemma 2.1. Let {an,m}n,m0 be the affine coordinates of U  Gr(0), and let w(x; z) and w(x; z) be the wave function and dual wave function associated to the tau-function U (x) respectively. Then we have:

span w(0; z), xw(0; z), x2w(0; z), и и и = span zk - an,kz-n-1 k0,
n=0 
span w(0; z), xw(0; z), x2w(0; z), и и и = span zk + ak,nz-n-1 k0.
n=0

2.6. Zhou's formula for the n-point functions. Let FU := log(U ) be the free energy associated to the tau-function U where U  Gr(0). Define the (all-genera) n-point function of FU to be:

(32)

G(n) (z1 ,

и

ии

, zn)

:=

j1,иии ,jn1

nFU (x) xj1 и и и xjn

и z1-j1-1 и и и zn-jn-1.
x=0

In [43, Д5], Zhou derived the following formula to compute the n-point functions:

Theorem 2.2 ( [43]). Let {an,m}n,m0 be the affine coordinates for U , and denote:

(33)

A(, ) :=

an,m  -n-1  -m-1 .

m,n0

A(zi, zj) = Aizj(,zzii,zzii-1)z,j + A(zi, zj ),

i < j; i = j; i > j,

and

i,

:=

k0 (-1)k  -1-k k .

Remark 2.2. In the framework of emergent geometry developed by Zhou, it would

be better to multiply the n-point functions G(n)(z1, и и и , zn) by dz1 и и и dzn and then understand them as some multi-linear differentials on the spectral curve associated

to the tau-function U , where z is a local coordinate on this spectral curve. See [43] for the emergence of the Airy curve from the Witten-Kontsevich tau-function  WK,

and see [46,49] for the emergence of the spectral curves for the Hermitian one-matrix

models and the dessin d'enfants respectively.

manner. See [44, 49] for the emergence of the E-O topological recursion from the

Virasoro constraints for the Hermitian one-matrix models with even couplings and

the dessin d'enfants respectively.

2.7. Affine coordinates of the Witten-Kontsevich tau-function. The affine coordinates {aW n,mK}n,m0 for the Witten-Kontsevich tau-function  WK was computed by Zhou in [45], see also [43, Д6.7]. The result is:

aW 3nK,3m-1

And aW n,mK = 0 if n + m  -1(mod 3).

In particular, one has:

which are the coefficients of the Faber-Zagier series (see [34]). Then one can use (28) to express  WK in terms of Schur functions:

 WK = aW х K и sх,
х

where for a partition х = (m1, и и и , mk|n1, и и и , nk), the coefficient is: aW х K = (-1)n1+иии+nk и det(aW ni,Kmj )1i,jk .
Since aW n,mK = 0 unless n + m  -1(mod 3), one has: aW х K = 0, if |х|  0(mod 3).

3. Open Intersection Numbers and the Affine Coordinates
In this section we first recall the open intersection numbers and the extended partition function  o, and then introduce our main result about the affine coordinates of  o and their recursions.

3.1. The open intersection numbers. First let us briefly recall some basic results on the open intersection numbers. See [35].
Let   C be the unit open disk and  be its closure, and let C be a closed Riemann surface. A holomorphic embedding   C is called extendable if it extends to a holomorphic embedding of an open neighborhood of . Two extendable embeddings are said to be disjoint if their images are disjoint in C. Let X be a connected open Riemann surface obtained by removing some disjoint extendable disks on a connected closed Riemann surface. Its boundary X is the union of the images of the unit circle S1  C under the extendable embeddings. Given such an (X, X), its double D(X, X) is canonically constructed using Schwarz reflections through the boundary components. The double genus of (X, X) is defined to be the usual genus of its double D(X, X). Let Mg,k,l be the moduli space of open Riemann surfaces of double genus g, with k distinct marked points on the boundary X and l distinct marked points in the interior X\X. It is a real orbifold of real dimension 3g - 3 + k + 2l, and is nonempty only if the stability condition 3g - 3 + k + 2l > 0 holds.
The open intersection numbers defined in [35] are:

(39)

a1 a2 и и и al k

o g

:=

1a1 2a2 и и и lal ,

Mg,k,l

where i is the first Chern class of the cotangent line bundle at the i-th interior marked point, and Mg,k,l is supposed to be some suitable compactification of the moduli space Mg,k,l. The well-definedness of this construction has been completed

14

ZHIYUAN WANG

for the case g = 0 in [35]. Then the open potential F o,geom is defined to be the following generating series of these open intersection numbers:

F o,geom(u; s; t0, t1, и и и ) :=

ug-1 и exp s +

tdd

o g

,

g0

d0

where s and t0, t1, t2, и и и are the coupling constants. The authors of [35] conjectured that the potential F o,geom(u; s; t0, t1, и и и ) satisfies a family of differential
equations called the open KdV equations. In [13] Buryak proved that there exists a unique solution F o to the open KdV satisfying a suitable initial condition, thus the conjecture of [35] becomes F o,geom = F o.

3.2. The extended partition function  o and Virasoro constraints. In [13, 14], Buryak introduced an extended potential

F o,ext(u; s0, s1, и и и ; t0, t1, и и и )

which is a solution the Burgers-KdV equations, where s0 := s. The open potential F o is recovered from F o,ext by setting sn = 0 for every n  1. He suggested that
this is the way to include the descendants on the boundary. Moreover, let

F c(u; t0, t1, и и и ) := u2g-2 и exp

tdd

c g

g0

d0

be the generating series of the intersection numbers

a1 a2 и и и an

c g

:=

1a1 2a2 и и и nan ,

Mg,n

where Mg,n is the Deligne-Mumford moduli space of stable curves [17, 30]. In other words, F c := log  WK where  WK is the Witten-Kontsevich tau-function.
Then Buryak proved that the extended partition function

(40)

 o := exp(F o,ext + F c)

satisfies the following Virasoro constraints ( [14, Theorem 1.2]):

(41)

Lenxt( o) = 0,

where the Miwa transform variables

are related to the coupling constants tk, sk by:

tn = (2n + 1)!! и T2n+1,

(44)

sn = 2n+1 и (n + 1)! и T2n+2,

for every n  0. He also proved that after the above change of variables, the extended partition function  o becomes a tau-function of the KP hierarchy with
respect to the time variables T = (T1, T2, T3, и и и ), and thus it is a point on the Sato Grassmannian.
In the rest of this paper, we'll always assume u = 1.

3.3. Affine coordinates of  o on the Sato Grassmannian. Now let us state our main result about the affine coordinates {aon,m}n,m0 of the tau-function  o. The proof of the following theorem will be given in Д5.

Theorem 3.1. We have:

(45)

ao0,3q-1 =

3 2

q и (2q - 1)!! и

q

54j

и

(6j - (2j)! и

1)!! (2j -

1)!!

.

j=0

Here we use the convention (-1)!! := 1. And for every p  0 and q  1,

(46)

ao3p+1,3q-2 = aW 3pK,3q-1, ao3p+2,3q-3 = aW 3pK+1,3q-2, ao3p+3,3q-1 = aW 3pK+2,3q - ao0,3q-1 и aW 3pK+2,0,

where {aW n,mK}n,m0 are the affine coordinates of the Witten-Kontsevich tau-function given by (36). Moreover, we have aon,m = 0 for n + m  -1(mod 3).

Remark 3.1. The numbers ao0,3q-1 coincide with the numbers dq given by [14, (1.9)]. Now denote by U o  Gr(0) the corresponding element in the big cell of the Sato
Grassmannian, then U o  H is spanned by the following normalized basis:

Now denote by U WK  Gr(0) the point on the big cell of the Sato Grassmannian corresponding to the Witten-Kontsevich tau-function  WK, and by

the normalized basis of U WK. Then by (46), for every n  1 we easily see:

(49) and thus:

fno =

z и fnW-K1, z и fnW-K1 - aW n-K1,0 и f0o,

if n  0(mod 3); if n  0(mod 3),

Corollary 3.1. We have:

(50)

U o = z и U WK  C и f0o.

where f0o is given by:

(51)

Remark 3.2. The affine coordinates {aW n,mK} for the Witten-Kontsevich tau-function satisfy the following symmetry (see Zhou [45, (65)]):

(52)

aW n,mK = (-1)n+m и aW m,Kn,

Using this symmetry and (38), the relation (49) for n  0(mod 3) becomes:

Remark 3.3. The relation (50) can also be derived using Alexandrov's construc-
tion of the admissible basis [6, (3.16)], while finding the explicit formulas for the coefficients of fno needs more computations.

3.4. Recursions and symmetries for the affine coordinates. The affine coordinates {aon,m}n,m0 satisfy some recursion relations and symmetry conditions. Let us denote aol,m := 0 for l < 0 or m < 0, then the following two theorems are straightforward corollaries of the Virasoro constraints (see Д5.4 for proofs):

Theorem 3.2. For every n  -1, we have the following (2n + 3)-step recursion for the affine coordinates:

(54)

In particular, for n = -1 we have:

which is the fermionic reformulation of the string equation Le-x1t( o) = 0.

Theorem 3.3. For every n  -1, we have the following linear constraints for the affine coordiantes:

Moreover, one can apply the symmetry (52) of {aW n,mK} to the relations (46), and in this way we easily obtain:

ao3p+2,3q-3 = (-1)p+q+1ao3q-1,3p, ao3p+1,3q-2 = (-1)p+q+1(ao3q,3p-1 + ao0,3p-1aW 3q-K1,0), ao3p+3,3q-1 = (-1)p+q ao3q+1,3p+1 - ao0,3q-1aW 3pK+2,0.

4. Computations of  o and log( o) Using Affine Coordinates
In this section, we show how to compute the tau-function  o and the free energy log( o) using the affine coordinates {aon,m}.

4.1. A formula of  o as a Bogoliubov transform. First let us regard  o as a vector |U o in the fermionic Fock space. By Theorem 2.1, we know that:

Theorem 4.1. Let aon,m be the affine coordinates given in Theorem 3.1, and Ao be the a quadratic operator of fermionic creators defined by:

(58)

Ao =

aon,m

-m-

1 2

- n-

1 2

.

n,m0

Then the tau-function  o is given by the following Bogoliubov transform of the fermionic vacuum |0 :

(59)

|U o = eAo |0 .

18

Expanding this exponential eAo, one gets:

|U o =|0 + (-1)n1+иии+nk и det(aoni,mj )1i,jk и |х

where the summation х on the right-hand side is over all partitions of positive integers, and х = (m1, и и и , mk|m1, и и и , nk) is the Frobenius notation of a partition х. For example, the first a few terms are:

4.2. A formula of  o as a summation of Schur functions. Using the bosonfermion correspondence, the tau-function  o can be regarded as a vector in the bosonic Fock space , and thus can be represented in terms of Schur functions.
The following is a straightforward consequence of (60):

Theorem

4.2.

Let

Tn

=

pn n

where

pn

are

the

Newton

symmetric

functions,

then

the tau-function  o is the following summation of Schur functions:

(61)

 o(T ) = 1 +

(-1)n1+иии+nk и det(aoni,mj )1i,jk и sх,

х: |х|>0

where aon,m are given in Theorem 3.1, and х = (m1, и и и , mk|m1, и и и , nk) is the Frobenius notation of the partition х.
Similar to the case of the Witten-Kontsevich tau-function, since aon,m = 0 for n + m  -1(mod 3), we must have:
Proposition 4.1. Denote by aoх the coefficient of sх in  o, then:

aoх = 0, if |х|  0(mod 3).

(Here we've omitted the terms whose coefficients are zero.) In particular, the coefficient of sх for a hook partition х = (m + 1, 1n) = (m|n) is simply (-1)n и aon,m.

4.3. Generating series of the affine coordinates. In the previous subsections we've discussed the expressions for the partition function  o in terms of the affine coordinates {aon,m}n,m0. It is also a natural question to compute the free energy log( o) using {aon,m}. A way to do this is to apply Zhou's formula (34) to compute the generating series of n-point correlators. In this subsection let us first compute the generating series Ao(x, y) of the affine coordinates.
Let a(z), b(z) be the Faber-Zagier series:

(62) and denote by

a(z) =



(6m - 1)!! 36m и (2m)!

z

-3m,

m=0

b(z) = -



(6m - 1)!! 36m и (2m)!

the generating series of ao0,m (see (45)). Now let

(64)

Ao(x, y) :=

aon,m x-n-1 y -m-1

n,m0

20

ZHIYUAN WANG

be the generating series of all aon,m, then by Theorem 3.1 we have:

Ao(x, y) =x-1 и ao0,3q-1y-3q +

aW n,mK y -m x-n-2

m0

- x-1 +

aW n,0Kx-n-2

n0

- x-1 +

aW n,mK y -m x-n-2 .

n,m0

Using the symmetry (52), one gets:

-x-1 + aW n,0Kx-n-2 = -x-1 + (-1)naW 0,nKx-n-2 = -x-1 и a(-x),

n0

n0

where a(z) is the Faber-Zagier series (62). Thus:

Ao(x,

y)

=

-

c(y)

и

(-

1 x

)a(-x)

-

1 x

+

y x

aW n,mK y -m-1 x-n-1

n,m0

=

c(y)a(-x) x

-

1

+

y x

aW n,mK y -m-1 x-n-1 .

n,m0

According to [43, (282)], one has:

(65)

aW n,mK x-n-1 y -m-1

=

y

1 -

x

+

a(y)b(-x) y2

- -

a(-x)b(y) x2

,

n,m0

(the notation Am,n in that work is aW n,mK here). Plugging this into the above formula for Ao(x, y), and in this way we've proved:

Theorem 4.3. We have:

(66)

Ao(x, y)

=

y

1 -

x

+

c(y)a(-x) x

+

y x

и

a(y)b(-x) y2

- -

a(-x)b(y x2

)

,

where the series a(z), b(z), c(z) are defined by (62) and (63).

Now using the above theorem and the explicit formulas for the series a(z), b(z)
and c(z), one can compute the coefficients {aon,m} effectively with the help of Maple or Mathematica. For example,

Ao(x, y)

Remark 4.1. The series c(z) coincide with the series D(z) introduced in [14, Д1.3] (after taking u = 1) and the formal integral o1(z) defined by [6, (3.16)]. Using the fermionic reformulation (55) of the string equation, one can easily derive the
following relations among these series (see also Buryak [14, ДA.2], and Alexandrov's
Kac-Schwarz operator [6, (3.19)]):

a(z) =

z-2z + 1 -

4.4. Computing the n-point functions using Zhou's formula. Now we can
apply Theorem 4.3 to Zhou's formula (34) to compute the following n-point functions of log( o):

(67)

Go(n)(z1, и и

и

,

zn)

:=

j1,иии ,jn1

n log  o(T ) Tj1 и и и Tjn

и z1-j1-1 и и и zn-jn-1.
T =0

Let us give some examples. For n = 1, the formula (34) simply gives:

Go(1)(z) = Ao(z, z) =

aon,m z-k-2,

k0 n+m=k

thus:

Go(1) (z )

=

where the variables Ti are related to the coupling constants ti and si of the open intersection theory by (44).

Remark 4.2. In [10, Theorem 1.6], Bertola and Ruzza have derived another algorithm to compute the n-point functions for the open intersections numbers and the Kontsevich-Penner models using a different method. Their formula is similar but somehow different from Zhou's formula (34) for an arbitraty tau-function of KP. It will be interesting to compare their matrix A() (see [10, (1.8)]) with the generating series Ao(x, y) of the affine coordinates.

4.5. Formulas for the 1-point functions. As an application of Zhou's formula, let us derive some formulas for the n-point functions Go(n)(z).
First consider the case n = 1. Recall that Go(1)(z) = Ao(z, z) where Ao(x, y) is given by (66), thus by L'Hopital's rule we obtain:

Go(1)(z)

=

lim
yz

y

1 -

z

+

c(y)a(-z) z

+

y z

и

a(y)b(-z) y2

- -

a(-z)b(y) z2

(69)

=

1 2z

+

c(z)a(-z) z

+

a(z)b(-z) - a(-z)b(z) 2z

+

a(z)b(-z

) - a(-z)b(z) 2z2

.

Moreover, it is known that the Faber-Zagier series a(z), b(z) satisfy the following

relation (see eg. [25] or [34]):

(70)

a(z)b(-z) - a(-z)b(z) = -2z,

AFFINE COORDINATES FOR OPEN INTERSECTION NUMBERS

25

thus the above formula becomes:

Proposition 4.2. We have:

(71)

Go(1) (z )

=

-

1 2z

+

c(z)a(-z) z

+

a(z)b(-z) - 2z

a(-z)b(z) .

Another way to compute the one-point function Go(1)(z) is to compare Go(1)(z) with the one-point function of the Witten-Kontsevich tau-function. In fact, let us

denote by

(72)

GW (n)K(z1, и и и

,

zn)

:=

j1,иии ,jn1

n log  WK(T Tj1 и и и Tjn

)

и z1-j1-1 и и и zn-jn-1
T =0

the n-point function of the Witten-Kontsevich tau-function (whose coefficients are

the intersection numbers on Mg,n), where T = (T1, T2 и и и ) are the time variables of the KP flows (warning: not the KdV flows!). Then by Zhou's formula (34), the

1-point function is given by:

(73) where (see (65)):

GW (1)K(z) = AWK(z, z),

(74)

AWK(x, y) :=

aW n,mK x-n-1 y -m-1

n,m0

=y

1 -

x

+

a(y)b(-x) y2

- -

a(-x)b(y) x2

.

Thus by (66) we have:

(75)

Ao(x, y)

-

AWK(x,

y)

=

c(y)a(-x) x

+

y x

-

1

и

a(y)b(-x) y2

- -

a(-x)b(y) x2

=

c(y)a(-x) x

+

a(y)b(-x) - a(-x)b(y) (y + x)x

,

therefore:

Go(1)(z) - GW (1)K(z) =Ao(z, z) - AWK(z, z)

(76)

=

c(z)a(-z) z

+

a(z)b(-z

) - a(-z)b(z 2z2

)

.

Again using (70), the above relation becomes:

(77)

Go(1)(z)

=GW (1)K(z)

+

c(z)a(-z) z

+

(-2z) 2z2

=GW (1)K(z)

+

c(z)a(-z) z

-

1.

It is known in literatures that the one-point correlators of the Witten-Kontsevich

tau-function is given by ( [42]):

3g-2

g

=

1 24g и

g!

,

thus (see [43, (295)]):

GW (1)K(z) =

(6g - 3)!! 24g и g!

и

z-6g+2,

g1

thus we obtain the following formula for the one-point function of log( o):

26

ZHIYUAN WANG

Proposition 4.3. We have:

(78)

Go(1)(z)

=

c(z)a(-z) - z

1

+

(6g - 3)!! 24g и g!

и

z-6g+2,

g1

where a(z), c(z) are given by (62) and (63).

Recall that the extended partition function is defined by  o = exp(F o,ext + F c) where F c = log( WK) is the free energy of the Witten-Kontsevich tau-function,
thus the above formula simply tells that:

Corollary 4.1. We have:

(79)

F o,ext j1 Tj

и z-j-1 =
T =0

c(z)a(-z) z

-

1

.

4.6. Formulas for the 2-point functions. Using (75) one can also write down the relations between Go(n) and GW (n)K for general n. However, the formulas will be complicated for n  2. For example, let us denote:

(x, y)

:=

Ao(x, y)

- AWK(x, y)

=

c(y)a(-x) x

+

a(y)b(-x) - a(-x)b(y) (y + x)x

,

and then by (82) we have:

Go(2)(x,

y)

-

GW (2)K(x, y)

=

(x,

y) x

- -

(y, y

x)

-

(x,

y )AWK (y ,

x)

- (y, x)AWK(x, y) - (x, y)(y, x).

Recall that by definition

Go(2)(x,

y)

-

GW (2)K(x,

y)

=

j,k1

2F o,ext  Tj  Tk

и x-j-1y-k-1,
T =0

and AWK(x, y) is given by (74), then after some direct computations and simplifications we obtain the following formula for the 2-point function:

Proposition 4.4. We have:

2F o,ext j,k1 TjTk

и x-j-1y-k-1
T =0

(80)

=

x(x2

1 -

y2)

a(y)a(-y)b(-x)c(x) - a(-x)a(-y)b(y)c(x)

+

1 y(x2 -

y2)

a(-x)a(-y)b(x)c(y) - a(x)a(-x)b(-y)c(y)

-

a(-x)a(-y)c(x)c(y) xy

,

where a(z), b(z), c(z) are given by (62) and (63).

Furthermore, one can also plug (74) into (34) and obtain:

GW (2)K

= (x2

1 - y2)2

a(x)a(y)b(-x)b(-y) + a(-x)a(-y)b(x)b(y)

(81)

- a(y)a(-y)b(x)b(-x) - a(x)a(-x)b(y)b(-y)

-

(x

1 -

y)2 ,

AFFINE COORDINATES FOR OPEN INTERSECTION NUMBERS

thus the above formula gives us the following:

Corollary 4.2. We have:

Go(2)(x, y) =

и x-j-1y-k-1

- a(y)a(-y)b(x)b(-x) - a(x)a(-x)b(y)b(-y) .

4.7. Formulas for the 3-point functions. Now let us write down the formulas for the 3-point functions. Here we omit the details since they are similar to the computations in the last two subsections. By (34) and (66) we have:

Go(3)(x, y, z) =

a(-x)a(-y)a(-z)b(x)b(y)c(z) 2z(z2 - x2)(z2 - y2)

+

(x2

-

+

a(x)a(-x)b(y)b(-y)a(-z)b(z) (x2 - y2)(y2 - z2)(z2 - x2)

+

a(x)a(-x)b(y)b(-y)a(z)b(-z) (x2 - y2)(y2 - z2)(z2 - x2)

(83)

+

a(x)a(-x)b(-z)c(z)a(y)b(-y) z(x2 - y2)(y2 - z2)

+

a(x)a(-x)b(-z)c(z)a(-y)b(y) z(x2 - y2)(x2 - z2)

+

a(x)a(-x)c(y)c(z)a(-y)b(-z) yz(x2 - z2)

+

a(x)a(-x)b(y)b(-y)a(-z)c(z) z(y2 - x2)(y2 - z2)

a(-x)a(-y)a(-z)c(x)c(y)c(z)

+

3xyz

+

[и и и ],

S3\{1}

where the term [и и и ] is obtained by applying the nontrivial permutation  of (x, y, z) to the terms listed in [и и и ].
Moreover, we know that:

3F o,ext j,k,l1 TjTkTl

и x-j-1y-k-1z-l-1 = Go(3)(x, y, z) - GW (3)K(x, y, z),
T =0

28

ZHIYUAN WANG

where GW (3)K can be computed using (34) and (74). Then we plug the result into the above formula, and finally obtain:

3F o,ext j,k,l1 TjTkTl

и x-j-1y-k-1z-l-1

5. Proof of the Main Theorem

In this section let us prove Theorem 3.1 and the recursions given in Д3.4 using the Virasoro constraints. Following the method developed in [45, 48], we derive a reformulation of the Virasoro constraints in the fermionic picture.

5.1. Computations of ao1,m. Let U o  Gr(0) be the point corresponding to the tau-function  o, and let {aon,m} be its affine coordinates. Then by definition, U o is spanned by the following normalized basis:

z

n+

1 2

+

aon,m

z

-m-

1 2

n0.

m0

In [6], Alexandrov has found an admissible basis for the point U o  Gr(0), expressed in terms of some formal integrals. One can try to expand these for-
mal integrals and derive a normalized basis from this admissible basis. Using this method, it is easy to find the relations between {aon,m}n1 and {aW n,mK}, but not easy to write down the numbers explicitly. Here let us take another strategy. We
will start from the Virasoro constraints, and use fermionic reformulation of the Vi-
rasoro constraints to derive some recursion relations and constraints for the affine coordinates {aon,m}n,m0, which enables us to solve these affine coordinates. These recursions will also lead to an explicit formula for {ao0,m}. Besides the recursions from Virasoro constraints, we will also need some initial data for these recursions, and we'll see that a good choice of initial data is {ao1,m}m0. A way to compute {ao1,m}m0 is to compute the dual wave function and then use Lemma 2.1. Here we directly use the following result of Alexandrov (see [6, (3.16)]):

o2(z)

for

there

thus

it is also the second vector of the normalized basis for U o, i.e.,

m=0

Thus we have: (85)

ao1,3q-2

=

1 36q

и

(6q + 1)!! (2q)!

и

1 6q +

1,

q  1,

and a1,m = 0 if m  1(mod 3). Comparing this with (38), we see:

(86)

ao1,3m-2 = aW 0,3Km-1.

This proves a special case of (46).

5.2. A reformulation of the Virasoro operators. Before reformulating the Virasoro constraints into the fermionic picture, we need to modify the Virasoro operators (42) for n  1.
Recall that after the change of variables

tn = (2n + 1)!! и T2n+1,

sn = 2n+1 и (n + 1)! и T2n+2,

the Virasoro operators Lenxt for n  1 are (after taking u = 1):

2)T2i+2

Using the following result of Buryak [14, Д5.2]:

k  T2k

one has:

 T2n

n-1 i=1

2  T2i  T2n-2i

+ (n +

.

Then we can rewrite the constraints Lenxt( o) = 0 (for n  1) as:

(87)

Lenxt( o) = 0,

where Lenxt are defined by (see also [6, (3.24)]):

Lenxt

In the following subsections we will use this version of Virasoro operators.

5.3. Virasoro operators in the fermionic picture. Now let us convert the Virasoro constraints for  o into the fermionic picture.
First we need to do some preparations. Define:

(89)

n =

: rs :,

r+s=n

n  Z,

where r, s are half-integers and r, s are the fermions. correspondence, they act on the bosonic Fock space by:

 (-n)T-n, n < 0;

(90)

n

=

0,
Tn

,

n = 0; n > 0.

By the boson-fermion

Moreover, we denote:

(z) =: (z)(z) := nz-n-1,
nZ
where (z), (z) are the generating series of fermions:

(z) =

r

z

-r-

1 2

,

rZ+

1 2

(z) =

r

z

-r-

1 2

.

rZ+

1 2

Then by Wick's theorem and some standard computations of operator product expansions, one has:

(z)(w)

=

(z

1 - w)2

+

:

w (w) (w)

:

+

:

w(w)(w)

:

+иии

,

and it follows that:

(91)

: ab :=

(s - r) : rs :,

a+b=n

r+s=n

where a, b are integers and r, s are half-integers.
Now let us rewrite the Virasoro operators in terms of the fermions. First by (42) we can rewrite Le-x1t as:

5.4. Recursions for affine coordinates from Virasoro constraints. Now let
us derive the recursion relations for the affine coordinates {aon,m} using the fermionic reformulations of Virasoro operators.
First let us compute e-AoLe-x1teAo|0 using the properties (18) and (19). For example, the first term is:

e-Ao  1 1 eAo |0 = e-Ao  1 eAo e-Ao 1 eAo |0

Similarly, we can compute e-Ao Le-x1teAo |0 term by term, and the result is: e-Ao Le-x1teAo |0

Since the boson-fermion correspondence is an isomorphism, by Le-x1t( o) = 0 we must have:

Le-x1teAo |0 = Le-x1t|U o = 0,

and thus the expression (92) is also zero. Now computing the coefficient of each term in (92), we may obtain a family of constraints for {aon,m}. For example, the coefficient of |0 gives:

(93)

ao0,0 = 0.

Then

we

compute

the

coefficient

of

  -

1 2

-

1 2



and

get:

-ao0,1 + ao1,0 = 0.

We already know that ao1,0 = 0, thus:

(94)

ao0,1 = 0.

Next,

computing

the

coefficient

of

-

1 2

-

3 2

|0

gives:

1 2

-

ao1,1

+

ao2,0

=

0,

and

computing

the

coefficient

of

-

3 2

-

1 2

|0

gives:

3 2

-

ao0,2

+

ao1,1

=

0.

By

(85)

we've

already

know

that

ao1,1

=

5 24

,

thus:

(95)

ao2,0

=

-

7 24

,

ao0,2

=

41 24

.

Similarly,

we

compute

the

coefficient

of

-m-

1 2

- n-

1 2

|0

for general n, m  0, and

in this way we easily obtain:

Proposition 5.1. For m + n  2, we have:

(96)

(m

(n

Here we denote aon,m := 0 if n < 0 or m < 0.

This proves the 1-step recursion (55). In the following subsections we'll see that the affine coordinates {aon,m}n,m0 can be uniquely determined using the above 1-step recursion and the initial values (85). Nevertheless, here let us write down all
the constraints provided by Lenxt for n  0. We omit the details and only give the results since the computations are similar to the case of Le-x1t. The constraint from the operator Le0xt is:

0 = - ao0,2 - ao1,1 - ao2,0 +

Now computing the coefficients of |0

for

every n, m  0, we've proved the recursion relations and constraints in Theorem

3.2 and Theorem 3.3.

5.5. The modulo 3 property. Now we've already know that:

ao0,0 = ao0,1 = ao1,0 = 0.
Let k be a fixed positive integer, and assume that we already know the values of all aon,m with n + m < k. Then using the recursion (96) and the initial value ao1,k-1 given by (85), we can compute all aon,m with n + m = k. Thus by induction all the coordinates {aon,m}n,m0 are uniquely determined by the 1-step recursion (96) and initial data (85).
Moreover, similar to the case of Witten-Kontsevich tau-function, here we also have the following modulo 3 property:

Lemma 5.1. We have aon,m = 0 for n + m  -1(mod 3).

Proof. We prove by induction on n + m. The case m + n = 0, 1 are clear. Now assume that the conclusion holds for all (m, n) with m + n  k. If k = 3l,
then consider the case m + n = 3l + 1. In this case (96) gives:

ao0,3l-naon,0 - aon,3l+1-n + aon+1,3l-n

+(3l

-

n

+

1 2

)aon,3l-n-2

+

(n

-

3 2

)aon-2,3l-n

=

0

By induction hypothesis we easily see aon,3l-n-2 = aon-2,3l-n = 0. Moreover, we must have either n  -1(mod 3) or (3l - n)  -1(mod 3), thus ao0,3l-naon,0 = 0. Then the above recursion gives:

aon,3l+1-n = aon+1,3l-n.
Recall that we already have ao1,3l = 0, thus aon,3l+1-n = 0 for every n. Similarly for k = 3l - 1 or k = 3l - 2, we can also verify the case for m+ n  k + 1
by induction.

34

Now using the above property, let us rewrite the recursion (96) as follows:

(97)

aop,3q-1-p - aop+1,3q-2-p

=ao0,3q-2-p aop,0

+

(3q

(p

,

for every q  2 and 0  p  3q - 1.

5.6. Computations of ao2,m. In this subsection let us compute ao2,m for general m  0. First recall that

(98)

ao2,0

=

-

7 24

,

and ao2,m = 0 for m  0(mod 3). By taking p = 1 in the recursion (97), we obtain:

(99)

ao2,3q-3

=

ao1,3q-2

-

(3q

-

5 2

)ao1,3q-5.

for q  2. For example,

ao2,3

=

ao1,4

-

7 2

ao1,1

=

385 1152

-

7 2

и

5 24

=

-

,

ao2,6

=

ao1,7

-

ao1,4

=

и

ao1,7

-

19 2

и

85085 82944

=

- 470946125632745,

ииииии

Now plugging (85) into the relation (99), one easily finds that:

(100)

ao2,3q-3

=

-

1 36q

и

(6q + 1)!! (2q)!

и

1 6q - 1

=

aW 1,3Kq-2,

given by the Faber-Zagier series. This proves another special case of (46).

5.7. Computations of ao0,m. Now let us compute ao0,3q-1. First recall that we've already known:

(101)

ao0,2

=

41 24

.

And then taking p = 0 in (97), we obtain a recursion:

(102)

ao0,3q-1

=

ao1,3q-2

+

(3q

-

3 2

)ao0,3q-4

,

where {ao1,3q-2} are given by (85). For example,

q  2,

ao0,5

=

ao1,4

+

9 2

ao0,2

=

385 1152

+

9 2

и

41 24

=

9241 1152

,

ao0,8

=

ao1,7

+

15 2

ao0,5

=

85085 82944

+

15 2

и

9241 1152

=

508725924245 ,

ao0,11

=

ao1,10

+

21 2

ao0,8

=

37182145 7962624

+

21 2

и

5075225 82944

=

51759360206829445,

ииииии

Now let us claim that for every q  1, we have:

(103)

ao0,3q-1 =

3 2

q и (2q - 1)!! и

q

54j

и

(6j - (2j)! и

1)!! (2j -

,

j=0

AFFINE COORDINATES FOR OPEN INTERSECTION NUMBERS

35

where we use the convention (-1)!! := 1. We prove by induction on q. The case q = 1 can be easily checked. Now assume the conclusion holds for q, then by (85) and the recursion (102) one has:

ao0,3q+2

=ao1,3q+1

+

(3q

+

3 2

)ao0,3q-1

=

(6q 36q+1 и

(2q

+

и

q+1

54j

и

(6j - 1)!! (2j)! и (2j -

1)!!

,

j=0

Thus the conclusion holds, and this proves (45).

5.8. Computations of aon,m for n  3. Now let us complete the proof of Theorem 3.1. In this proof we will make use of the following recursion relation for the affine coordinates {aW n,mK}n,m0 of Witten-Kontsevich tau-function:
Lemma 5.2 ( [45]). For every m + n  2,

(104)

aW n+K1,m = aW n,mK+1 - aW 0,mKaW n,0K -

(m

-

1 2

)aW n,mK-2

+

(n

-

1 2

)aW n-K2,m

.

This recursion is obtained by converting the string equation for the Witten-

Kontsevich tau-function into the fermionic picture, see [45, (61)]. Notice that the

notations Am,n in that work are related to aW n,mK by:

Am,n =



-

-2 4

m+n+1 3
и aW n,mK,

m, n  0.

Now let us prove (46) by induction on p. First notice that by comparing (85), (100) with (38), we already have:

(105)

ao1,m = aW 0,mK+1,

ao2,m = aW 1,mK+1.

First let us consider the case aon,m with n = 3p + 1 and m = 3q - 2. By the recursion (97) we have:

(106)

ao3p,3q-1

-

ao3p+1,3q-2

=

(3q

-

3 2

)ao3p,3q-4

+

(3p

-

3 2

)ao3p-2,3q-2

.

Thus by induction hypothesis:

ao3p+1,3q-2

=ao3p,3q-1

-

(3q

-

3 2

)ao3p,3q-4

-

(3p

-

3 2

)ao3p-2,3q-2

=aW 3pK-1,3q

-

ao0,3q-1 aW 3pK-1,0

-

(3q

-

3 2

)(aW 3pK-1,3q-3

-

ao0,3q-4aW 3pK-1,0)

-

(3p

-

3 2

)aW 3pK-3,3q-1

=aW 3pK-1,3q

-

ao0,3q-1 aW 3pK-1,0

+

(3q

-

3 2

)ao0,3q-4 aW 3pK-1,0

-

(3q

-

3 2

)aW 3pK-1,3q-3

+

(3p

-

3 2

)aW 3pK-3,3q-1

.

By (104) we know that:

(3q

-

3 2

)aW 3pK-1,3q-3

+

(3p

-

3 2

)aW 3pK-3,3q-1

=

aW 3pK-1,3q

-

aW 0,3Kq-1aW 3pK-1,0

-

aW 3pK,3q-1 ,

36

ZHIYUAN WANG

and thus

ao3p+1,3q-2

=aW 3pK-1,3q

-

ao0,3q-1 aW 3pK-1,0

+

(3q

-

3 2

)ao0,3q-4

aW 3pK-1,0

- (aW 3pK-1,3q - aW 0,3Kq-1aW 3pK-1,0 - aW 3pK,3q-1)

=aW 3pK,3q-1 + aW 3pK-1,0

-

aW 0,3Kq-1

+

ao0,3q-1

-

(3q

-

3 2

)ao0,3q-4

.

Moreover, by (102) and (105) we have:

-aW 0,3Kq-1

+

ao0,3q-1

-

(3q

-

3 2

)ao0,3q-4

=

-ao1,3q-2

+

ao1,3q-2

=

0,

therefore:

(107)

ao3p+1,3q-2 = aW 3pK,3q-1.

Similarly, for n = 3p + 2 one can check that:

ao3p+2,3q-3

=ao3p+1,3q-2

-

(3q

-

5 2

)ao3p+1,3q-5

-

(3p

-

1 2

)ao3p-1,3q-3

=aW 3pK,3q-1 -

(3q

-

5 2

)aW 3pK,3q-4

+

(3p

-

1 2

)aW 3pK-2,3q-2

=aW 3pK,3q-1 + (aW 3pK+1,3q-2 - aW 3pK,3q-1) =aW 3pK+1,3q-2 ,

by (97), (104) and the induction hypothesis. Finally, let us consider the case n = 3p. We have:

ao3p,3q-1

=

-

ao0,3q-1ao3p-1,0

+

ao3p-1,3q

-

(3q

-

1 2

)ao3p-1,3q-3

-

(3p

-

5 2

)ao3p-3,3q-1

=

-

ao0,3q-1ao3p-1,0

+

aW 3pK-2,3q+1

-

(3q

-

1 2

)aW 3pK-2,3q-2

-

(3p

-

5 2

)(aW 3pK-4,3q

-

ao0,3q-1aW 3pK-4,0)

=

-

ao0,3q-1ao3p-1,0

+

aW 3pK-2,3q+1

+

(3p

-

5 2

)ao0,3q-1 aW 3pK-4,0

+ (aW 3pK-1,3q - aW 3pK-2,3q+1)

=aW 3pK-1,3q - ao0,3q-1

ao3p-1,0

-

(3p

-

5 2

)aW 3pK-4,0

,

thus it suffices to prove that:

ao3p-1,0

-

(3p

-

5 2

)aW 3pK-4,0

=

aW 3pK-1,0.

By the induction hypothesis we only need to prove:

aW 3pK-2,1

-

(3p

-

5 2

)aW 3pK-4,0

=

aW 3pK-1,0,

and this follows from (104). Now we've finished the proof of Theorem 3.1.
