## Abstract

We show that a general but shear-free perturbation of homogeneous and isotropic universes are necessarily silent, without any gravitational waves. We prove this in two steps. First we establish that a shear free perturbation of these universes are acceleration-free and the fluid flow geodesics of the background universe maps onto themselves in the perturbed universe. This effect then decouples the evolution equations of the electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor in the perturbed spacetimes and the magnetic part no longer contains any tensor modes. Although the electric part, that drives the tidal forces, do have tensor modes sourced by the anisotropic stress, these modes have homogeneous oscillations at every point on a time slice without any wave propagation. We also show the presence of vorticity vector waves that are sourced by the curl of heat flux. This analysis shows the critical role of the shear tensor in generating cosmological gravitational waves in an expanding universe.
