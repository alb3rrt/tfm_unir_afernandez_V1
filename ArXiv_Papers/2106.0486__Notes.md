## Abstract

We combine the graph-theoretical ideas behind Moravcsik's theorem on complete sets of polarization observables, which has been reexamined recently, with the full derivation of the phase-ambiguities implied by a particular shape-class of photoproduction observables, which has been recently published by Nakayama. The result is a new graphical procedure for the derivation of certain types of complete sets for an amplitude-extraction problem with $N$ helicity-amplitudes. The procedure is directly applicable to pseudoscalar meson photoproduction ($N = 4$ amplitudes) and electroproduction ($N = 6$ amplitudes), where in both cases it directly yields complete sets with a minimal length of $2 N$ observables. For the case of electroproduction, we give here for the first time an extensive list of complete sets composed of $2 N = 12$ observables. Furthermore, we sketch how the proposed procedure can be generalized to processes with a larger number of amplitudes, i.e. $N > 6$ amplitudes. We outline this procedure for the next more complicated example of two-meson photoproduction ($N = 8$ amplitudes).
