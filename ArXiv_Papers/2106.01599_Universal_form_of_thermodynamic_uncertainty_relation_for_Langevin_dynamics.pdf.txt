(Dated: June 4, 2021) Thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) provides a stricter bound for entropy production (EP) than that of the thermodynamic second law. This stricter bound can be utilized to infer the EP and derive other tradeoff relations. Though the validity of the TUR has been verified in various stochastic systems, its application to general Langevin dynamics has not been successful in a unified way, especially for underdamped Langevin dynamics, where odd parity variables in time-reversal operation such as velocity get involved. Previous TURs for underdamped Langevin dynamics is neither experimentally accessible nor reduced to the original form of the overdamped Langevin dynamics in the zero-mass limit. Here, we find an operationally accessible TUR for underdamped Langevin dynamics with an arbitrary time-dependent protocol. We show that the original TUR is a consequence of our underdamped TUR in the zero-mass limit. This indicates that the TUR formulation presented here can be regarded as the universal form of the TUR for general Langevin dynamics. The validity of our result is examined and confirmed for three prototypical underdamped Langevin systems and their zero-mass limits; free diffusion dynamics, charged Brownian particle in a magnetic field, and molecular refrigerator.

I. INTRODUCTION

Thermodynamic processes and accompanying entropy production (EP) are constrained by the thermodyanmic second law, stating that the EP is always nonnegative. Beyond the second law, a new thermodynamic bound was discovered in 2015 [1], called the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) expressed in terms of the TUR factor Q as

with a time-accumulated current , its steady-state average  and variance Var[] , the Boltzmann constant kB, and the average total EP S tot. This is basically a trade-off relation between the fluctuation magnitude and the thermodynamic cost of a stochastic system given as an inequality with the universal lower bound. As the variance is always positive, the TUR sets a positive lower bound of the EP, thus provides a tighter bound than the second law. This bound can be utilized for inferring the EP by measuring a certain current statistics in a nonequilibrium process [2­4]. Moreover, a recent debate on thermodynamic trade-off relations among the efficiency, power, and reversibility of a heat engine [5­12] has also been investigated based on the TUR bound [13].
After the first discovery in 2015 [1], the validity of the TUR has been rigorously proven for a variety of stochastic systems [14­26]. First, it was shown that the TUR in the original form, Eq. (1), holds for a continuous-time Markov process with discrete states [14, 15] and the overdamped Langevin dynamics with a continuous state space in the steady state [16]. Later, TURs for these two stochastic systems with an arbitrary initial state [17, 18] and an arbitrary time-dependent driving [19] have been found. The TUR for a discrete-time

Markov process was first discovered only in an exponential form [20], but later, the linearized version was also found [18]. We note that the TUR for general stochastic systems was found in an exponential form recently [21, 22]. However, the exponential form is not practically useful in a sense that the physical meaning of the cost function is hard to be interpreted and its bound is quite loose far from equilibrium due to the nature of the exponential function.
Compared to other stochastic systems, studies on the TUR for underdamped Langevin systems have made little progress. In contrast to the overdamped Langevin systems, the oddparity variables like velocity come into play in the underdamped dynamics and the probability current is divided into two parts; the reversible and the irreversible current. As only the latter contributes to the EP [27, 28], the thermodynamic cost function could not be simply written in terms of the EP only, but also includes some kinetic quantities such as dynamical activity, which are not easily accessible in experiments [29, 30]. This significantly degrades the applicability of the TUR for inferring the EP in the underdamped Langevin dynamics. In addition, the link between the TURs for the overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics has been missing. Mathematically, the overdamped dynamics is usually attained in the zero-mass limit of the underdamped dynamics. However, the zero-mass limit of the previous TURs for the underdamped dynamics becomes meaningless as the dynamic activity (thus, the cost function) diverges [30]. This clearly reveals the lack of systematic understanding on the thermodynamic trade-off relation in a more fundamental level of description. Moreover, due to this difficulty, the TUR for the underdamped Langevin dynamics with an arbitrary timedependent driving force has not been studied.
In this study, we derive rigorously an operationally accessible TUR for general underdamped Langevin systems with an arbitrary time-dependent driving protocol, including velocitydependent forces like a magnetic Lorentz force breaking time reversal. The cost function of this TUR is expressed in terms of the EP without any kinetic quantity and an initial-state-

2

dependent term which is negligible for the long observationtime limit. Furthermore, this TUR returns back to the original TUR of the overdamped dynamics (Eq. (1)) in the zero-mass limit when the driving forces and the current weight function do not include odd variables. Thus, our TUR can be regarded as the universal form of the TUR for general Langevin dynamics.

II. MODEL AND MAIN RESULTS

We consider a N-dimensional underdamped Langevin system driven by a force F(x, v, t) = (F1, · · · , FN), where x = (x1, · · · , xN) and v = (v1, · · · , vN) are the position and velocity vectors of the system, respectively. Dynamics of the i-th component of the system (xi, vi) is in contact with a thermal reservoir with temperature Ti. Then, the dynamics can be described by the following equation:

xi = vi, mivi = Fi(x, v, t) - ivi + i,

(2)

where mi, i, and i are the i-th mass, dissipation coef-

ficient, and Gaussian white noise satisfying i(t) j(t ) =

2kBiTii j(t - t ) with zero mean, respectively. For conve-

nience, we set the Boltzmann constant kB = 1 in the follow-

ing discussion. A general time-dependent force Fi consists

of two parts; reversible Firev and irreversible Fiir forces, that

is, Fi(x, v, t) = Firev(x, v, t) + Fiir(x, v, t) with Firev(x, v, t) =

(x, -v, t), where the `' parameters in the time-

reversal process [28, 30]. Without loss of generality, we can

set

Firev(x, v, t) = s firev(rx, v, t),

Fiir(x, v, t) = fiir(rx, v, t),

(3)

where s, r,  are the scaling parameters for force, position,

and time, respectively. Note that s is multiplied to the re-

versible force only, which is one of the key manipulation for

deriving the trajectory of

TUR. We consider  the system from t =

current  which has the following form:



()  dt (xt, vt, t; s, r, ) · vt,

(4)

0

with the weight function vector

 = s(rxt, vt, t) .

(5)

Note that the same scale parameter s is used for the weight function and the reversible force for later convenience.
Then, our first main result is the following underdamped TUR in terms of the underdamped TUR factor Qu as

where  is defined as

  h^  , where h^   - ss - rr -  , (7)

and I is an initial-state-dependent term defined in Eq. (34) which depends on the dynamic details but becomes negligible in the large- limit. Equation (6) holds for processes with arbitrary time-dependent driving from an arbitrary initial state. This underdamped TUR resembles the overdamped TUR recently found in [31] with additional scale parameters s and r. Note that  is experimentally accessible by measuring the response of  with respect to a slight change of the observation time , the reversible force magnitude s, the system scale r, and the driving speed . Thus, the EP can be readily inferred from real experiments by measuring a proper current or a set of currents [32]. We emphasize that our underdamped TUR does not contain any kinetic term like dynamical activity. Furthermore, this TUR provides a much tighter bound, compared to the previous TURs for the underdamped dynamics [21, 22, 29, 30], which will be explicitly shown in the examples below.
Another fascinating part of our undermdaped TUR is that the overdamped TUR, Eq. (1), arises naturally by taking the zero-mass limit, in case of no velocity-dependent force. For simplicity, we consider a steady-state TUR without any timedependent protocol and no time-dependence in the weight function  of a current of interest ( = 0). To obtain the standard overdamped limit, the velocity variables should not be included in the driving force, i.e.

Fi = s firev(rx) and  = s(rxt).

(8)

Then, in the zero mass limit,  and I in Eq. (6) becomes

 = -  and I = 0

(9)

in the steady state, which leads to the original TUR (Eq. (1)). This is our second main result. The overdamped TUR for an arbitrary time-dependent protocol is discussed in Sect. IV. The proofs of Eq. (6) and Eq. (9) are presented in Sect. IV.

III. EXAMPLES

To illustrate the usefulness and validity of our main results, we concentrate on steady-state processes where F and  have no explicit time dependence in the following examples. With these conditions, the underdamped TUR is simplified with

 = ss  (1 - ss - rr)  ,

(10)

in the steady state.

A. Example 1: free diffusion with drift Consider a displacement current in the free diffusion process of a Brownian particle with mass m, driven by a constant external force F. We set F = s f e1 = Frev, where f is a constant and e1 is the unit vector along the x1 axis. We choose the weight function  = se1, yielding () as displacement at t =  from the initial position at t = 0 along the x1-axis. Note that s is a scale parameter, which will be set to be unity after the whole calculation. This model was studied recently as

Other system parameters are set to be unity, f = 1 = T1 = 1.

a paradigmatic example for a conjecture of the underdamped TUR in one dimension [33].
It is easy to show that the steady-state velocity is v1 ss = s f /1, thus we get  = s v1 ss = s2 f /1. Consequently, we obtain

ss = (1 - ss)  = -  .

(11)

Using Eq. (6) and Eq. (11), the underdamped TUR for the free diffusion process with drift at s = 1 becomes

(12) returns back to the original TUR form in the overdamped limit. For a finite mass, the original TUR is recovered only when Ifree is negligible in the large- limit.
Figure 1 shows analytic (curves) and numerical (dots) plots of the TUR factors Qu and Q for various values of m as a function of . The analytic expressions are presented in Ref. [34] and the numerical data are obtained by averaging over 107 trajectories from the Langevin equation. As expected from our underdamped TUR, Qu is always above the lower bound of 2 for any observation time period , and approaches the bound either in the zero-mass limit or in the large- limit. The conventional TUR factor Q approaches the bound from below (violations of the original TUR) in these limits. This example clearly demonstrates the importance of the initial-state dependent term I in the underdamped dynamics for a finite , which usually vanishes in the overdamped limit. The free-diffusion

bound conjecture [33] also involves  in the lower bound, though it differs from our rigorous bound (see Ref. [34] for discussions).

B. Example 2: charged particle in a magnetic field

The next example is the motion of a charged Brownian particle under a magnetic field B in a two-dimensional space [30, 35]. The particle is trapped in a harmonic potential with stiffness k and driven by a nonconservative rotational force. Then, the total force is given by F = Fnc + Fmag + Fhar with the nonconservative rotational force Fnc = s(rx2, -rx1), the Lorentz force induced by the magnetic field Fmag = sB(v2, -v1), and the harmonic force Fhar = -sk(rx1, rx2). By regarding the magnetic field B as an odd-parity parameter, we treat the whole force F as a reversible one. The opposite choice is also possible [30, 36, 37]. Here, we consider the case 1 = 2  , m1 = m2  m, and T1 = T2  T . We are interested in the work current done by the nonconservative force, thus,  = Fnc. By replacing the parameters as   sr, B  sB, and k  srk from the result of Ref. [35], the steady-state work current can be written as

(13)

with the stability condition k/s + B - r2m/ > 0. Then, we obtain from Eq. (10)

(14)

With dimensionless parameters B0 = B/, 0 = /k, and m0 = mk/2, the underdamped TUR at s = r = 1 can be written as

The derivation of Imag is shown in Ref. [34], and Var[] can be also calculated for any finite  by solving rather complex

matrix differential equations numerically (not shown here, but

see Ref. [38] for a sketch of derivations.) The EP is given by

the Clausius EP with the odd-parity choice of B [30, 37], thus

In Fig. 2, we plot Qu evaluated at various values of pa-

ranges of [0, 1], [0, 10], and [0, 10], respectively, with fixed

which confirms our underdamped TUR, than the conventional lower bound of 2

for 0B0 > 0. The previous bound including dynamical activity [29, 30] is very loose compared to our bound here (see

Fig.S1 in Ref. [34]). It is interesting to note that, in the equi-

librium limit (  0), gmag  1 and Qu Q approaches 2 for

nonzero B0, the broken time-reversal symmetry due to the

overdamped limit [35, 38]. Very recently, its lower bound

for the conventional TUR factor Q is rigorously obtained as

Eq. (15), which may be tighter than the above rigorous bound

for the overdamped limit, depending on the parameter values.

C. Example 3: Molecular refrigerator We consider an one-dimensional Brownian particle driven by a velocity-dependent force F = -v, which serves as an effective frictional force ( > 0) to reduce thermal fluctuations of mesoscopic systems such as a suspended mirror of interferometric detectors [39, 40] and an atomic-force-microscope

(AFM) cantilever [41, 42]. Thus, this mechanism is often refereed to molecular refrigerator [43].
We take  as an odd-parity parameter to derive a useful bound for the TUR factor [30], which implies that the sign of  should change under time reversal. Then, Frev = -sv and Fir = 0 with the scale parameter s for the reversible force. The steady-state distribution is simply given by

Pss(v; s) =

where T e = T/( + s) is the effective temperature. The current of our interest is the work current done by the

Figure 3 shows analytic (curves) and numerical (dots) plots of Qu and Q for various values of m as a function of . The analytic results are presented in Ref. [34] and the numerical data are obtained by averaging over 107 trajectories from the

Langevin equation. The underdamped TUR holds for any  as expected. The conventional TUR factor Q monotonically increases with  and approaches 2gmr < 2. The zero-mass limit does not lead to the original TUR due to the presence of a velocity-dependent force.

IV. DERIVATION OF TUR

The Fokker-Planck (FP) equation of the probability distribution function Pt = P(x, v, t; s, r, ) for the Langevin equation, Eq. (2), can be written as

t Pt = LPt = (Lriev + Liir)Pt,

(23)

(25)

Now, we consider a modified dynamics, satisfying the following FP equation parameterized by ,

t Pt, =

Lriev + (1 + )Liir Pt,,

(26)

i

which is called the -process. Then, it is straightforward to show that its solution is given by

Pt, = P(x, v, t; s, r, ) = (1 + )N P (x, v, t; s, r, ) (27)

with the scaled variables and parameters as

(28)

and the normalization factor (1 + )N. Note from Eq. (27) that the initial distribution P0, at t = 0 is -dependent.
This modification in the FP equation is equivalent to adding an extra force Yi to the original process as

Fi,(x, v, t) = Fi(x, v, t) + Yi(x, v, t; s, r, ) (29)

Next, we consider the average current   in the -

process. This is a function of the scale parameters, which can

be written as

=  (s, r, ) .

(35)

For the second equality of Eq. (35), we take variable changes of x by x and t by t, and use the relations of rx = rx, t = t, and Eq. (27). As t and x are dummy variables in the integration, we get the final equality with the average current in the original process with the scaled parameters s, r, , and the scaled observation time  = (1 + ). By differentiating the average current with respect to  and then setting  = 0, we find

  |=0 = h^   = ,

(36)

where the operator h^ is given by h^ =  - ss - rr - . Using Eq. (31), Eq. (33), and Eq. (36), we obtain the first main result of Eq. (6).
In order to find the TUR in the overdamped limit, we consider the case where the force and the current weight function are velocity-independent (thus, fiir = 0) as

Fi = s firev(rx, t), i = si(rx, t).

(37)

6

The corresponding overdamped FP equation of the probability distribution function t = (x, t; s, r, ) in the zero-mass limit is given as

tt = Loi t,

(38)

i

where the FP operator Loi is given as

Loi

s firev(rx, t) - Tixi

.

(39)

The overdamped limit of the underdamped -process can

be obtained formally by the standard small-mass expansion

method using the Brinkman's hirarchy [27]. In the presence of

a velocity-dependent force such as a magnetic Lorentz force,

the overdamped limit could become quite subtle [38], which

is not considered here. However, with no irreversible force

t(hfieir

= 0), it can -process is

be easily seen from Eq. (26) simply given by the original

and Eq. process

(25) that with the

replacement of i by (1+)i. Thus, we can immediately write down the FP equation for the -process in the overdamped

limit as

tt, =

1 1+

Lo t, .

(40)

This is exactly the same as the virtual-perturbation FP equation in Ref. [16, 19, 48, 49] with the relation of 1+ = 1/(1+) (the perturbation parameter ). This clearly shows that the -process of Eq. (26) in the underdamped dynamics is a natural extension of that in the overdamped dynamics. This dynamics is simply related to the  = 0 dynamics by rescaling the time t by a factor of 1 + . Thus, its solution is given by

t, = (x, t; s, r, ) = (x, t~; s, r, ~ ) ,

(41)

with the scaled parameters of t~ = t/(1 + ) and ~  = (1 + ). As we do not need any rescaling for s and r, we can set s = r = 1 from the beginning in Eq. (37), and the initial distribution for the -process can be chosen to be independent of  in general. As also shown in Ref. [19], we can easily obtain

 = -( - )  and I = 0 ,

(42)

which becomes Eq. (9) in the steady state without any timedependent protocol and weight function ( = 0).
From the underdamped solution in Eq. (27), we can also find another overdamped solution of t, = (1 + )N (x, t; s, r, ) satisfying Eq. (40), which requires the rescaling of s and r. The initial distribution is intrinsically -dependent due to the dependence of x, s, and r. Using this solution, we find the same formula for the TUR as

in Eq. (6) for the underdamped dynamics. This TUR is different from the TUR from Eq. (42) in general. However, if one chooses a -independent initial distribution, then the time evolutions of the two different solutions should be identical due to the uniqueness of the time evolution of the -dynamics, i.e. t, = (x, t~; s, r, ~ ) = (1+)N (x, t; s, r, ), starting from the same initial condition. The steady-state distribution of the -dynamics without a time-dependent protocol is such oaucsasfero, mi.eE. qs.s(i4s0)-.inTdheepreefnodreen, ti;fassp(rxo)c=ess ssst(axr)t,swfrhoimchaisstoebavdiystate at t = 0 and then an arbitrary time-dependent protocol is applied to the process for t > 0, which is a usual experimental setup, both solutions become identical, leading to the same TUR in Eq. (42). Without any time-dependent protocol and weight function, this yields the original TUR in Eq. (1). In the first two examples, we explicitly show the recovery of the original TUR in the zero-mass limit for ss and I, starting from the steady state.
V. CONCLUSION We derived the TUR for general underdamped Langevin systems with an arbitrary time-dependent driving from an arbitrary initial state, including velocity-dependent forces. In contrast to the previously reported one, our result is experimentally accessible and its lower bound is much tighter. Therefore, this bound can be utilized to facilitate inferring the EP by measuring a current statistics and its response to a slight change of various system parameters. Furthermore, the original TUR for the overdamped Langevin dynamics can be understood as its zero-mass limit. This implies that our underdamped TUR provides a universal form of the trade-off relation for general Langevin systems. It would be interesting to extend our result to systems with non-Markovian environmental noises such as active-matter systems, which are known to be described by effective underdamped Langevin dynamics [50, 51].

Langevin systems driven by a force without position dependence

Here, we consider a case where a Brownian particle is driven by an external force without position dependence. Then, the motion can be described by the following Langevin equation:

mivi = Fi(v, t) - ivi + i,

(S1)

where Fi = Firev(v, t) + Fiir(v, t) with Firev(v, t) = sfirev(v, t) and Fiir(v, t) = fiir(v, t). The steady state of such a system should be uniform in the position space, but mathematically not well defined due to the normalization problem without a trapping potential. To avoid this problem, one may introduce a confined space with proper boundary conditions or consider a reduced state space spanned by velocity variables only. We take the second strategy to derive the TUR for simplicity. Then, every derivation step is parallel to that for the general underdamped systems, except for removing all position variables as well as the associated scale factor r and the normalization constant (1 + )N for the modified dynamics. Also the integration over all position variables should be also omitted.

Calculation of initial-state dependent terms and TUR factors

Free diffusion with drift

As the external force of this example is position-independent and has a component only along the x1-axis, we consider a state space spanned by the velocity variable v1 only. First, it is easy to find the steady-state distribution P ss as

P ss(v1; s) =

m1 2T1

e-

m1 2T1

v1

(S2)

It is straightforward to obtain Stot =  sf v1 ss/T1 =  s2f 2/(T11),  =  s v1 ss =  s2f /1, and

Var[

with

Thus, the conventional TUR factor Q is given as

which was conjectured in Ref. [1] as the lower bound of Q for general underdamped dynamics in one dimension, referred as the free-diffusion bound conjecture of Q  Qfr.
For our underdamped TUR factor Qu, we need to calculate the initial-dependent term Ifr, defined in Eq. (34) of the main text. As the steady-state distribution in the modified -process can be written as Pss = P ss(v1; s/(1 + )) in Eq. (27) of the main text, we find

Ifr = 2

(S6)

One can easily show Qu  2 as expected from our underdamped TUR, and Qu  2+0fr/3 for small 0fr and  2+2/0fr for large 0fr. (S4) and (S6) are plotted in Fig. 1 of the main text. Without the knowledge of Var[ ], our underdamped TUR (Qu  2) predicts that the conventional TUR factor Q has a lower bound as Q  2/(1 + Ifr/Stot) = 2/(1 + 2/0fr), which is obviously satisfied with Q = Qfr.

Charged particle in a magnetic field

For a two-dimensional Brownian particle in a magnetic field, we define a state vector z  (x1, x2, v1, v2). The covariance matrix C  zTz ss of this system is given by [2, 3]

where K = srk + s2rB/ - s2r22m/2 > 0. Then, the steady-state distribution P ss can be written as

(S10)

Figure S1 shows the possible values of Q and Qu in the  =  limit for various parameter values in the stable
region (K > 0) for  > 0. The conventional TUR factor Q can go below the lower bound of 2 for B > 0, while our underdamped TUR factor Qu is always above the lower bound of 2 and many data are very close to the lower
bound. This indicates that our bound is really tight. For comparison, we also plot the previously found TUR factor Qkinetic including the dynamic activity in Ref. [3] in the  =  limit. As can be seen easily in Fig. S1, this bound is
significantly looser, thus not much useful.

(S15)

Again, it is easy to show that our underdamped TUR is always satisfied. (S12) and (S15) are plotted in Fig. 3 of the main text. Without any information on Var[ ], our underdamped TUR predicts that Q has a lower bound as Q  2gmr/(1 + Imr/Stot) = 22/[( + )2(1 + 2/0mr)], which is clearly satisfied with (S12). As  can be arbitrary, it is obvious that the free-diffusion-bound conjecture fails in this example.
