## Abstract

Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry takes advantage of the quantum nature of two-photon interference to increase the resolution of precision measurements of time-delays. Relying on few-photon probe states, this approach is applicable also in cases of extremely sensible samples and it achieves attosecond (nanometer path length) scale resolution, which is relevant to cell biology and two-dimensional materials. Here, we theoretically analyze how the precision of Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometers can be significantly improved by engineering the spectral distribution of two-photon probe states. In particular, we assess the metrological power of different classes of biphoton states with non-Gaussian time-frequency spectral distributions, considering the estimation of both time- and frequency-shifts. We find that grid states, characterized by a periodic structure of peaks in the chronocyclic Wigner function, can outperform standard biphoton states in sensing applications. The considered states can be feasibly produced with atomic photon sources, bulk non-linear crystals and integrated photonic waveguide devices.
