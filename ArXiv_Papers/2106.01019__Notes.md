## Abstract

We next consider situations in which the auctioneer cannot use the optimal auction and is required to use a second price auction. We show that there is always $\mathcal D_i\in D$ such that if the value of all bidders is independently drawn from $\mathcal D_i$ then running a second price auction guarantees a constant fraction of the revenue that can be obtained by a second-price auction by any possible mix of bidders. Finally, we show that for any $\varepsilon>0$ there exists a function $f$ that depends only on $\varepsilon$ (in particular, the function does not depend on $n$ or on the set $D$), such that recruiting $n$ bidders which have at most $f(\varepsilon)$ different distributions, all from $D$, guarantees $(1-\varepsilon)$-fraction of the revenue that can be obtained by a second-price auction by any possible mix of bidders.
