Abstract
In this paper, we study the convergence analysis for a robust stochastic structure-preserving Lagrangian numerical scheme in computing effective diffusivity of time-dependent chaotic flows, which are modeled by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Our numerical scheme is based on a splitting method to solve the corresponding SDEs in which the deterministic subproblem is discretized using structure-preserving schemes while the random subproblem is discretized using the Euler-Maruyama scheme. We obtain a sharp and uniform-in-time convergence analysis for the proposed numerical scheme that allows us to accurately compute long-time solutions of the SDEs. As such, we can compute the effective diffusivity for time-dependent flows. Finally, we present numerical results to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method in computing effective diffusivity for the time-dependent Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (ABC) flow and Kolmogorov flow in three-dimensional space.

1. Introduction

In this paper, we study the convection-enhanced diffusion phenomenon for particles moving in time-dependent chaotic flows, which is defined by the following passive tracer model, i.e., a stochastic differential equation (SDE),

dX(t) = v(t, X)dt + dw(t), X  Rd,

(1)

where X(t) = (x1(t), ..., xd(t))T  Rd is the position of the particle,  > 0 is the molecular diffusivity, and {w(t)}t0 is the standard d-dimensional Browinian motion. The velocity field v(t, x) is time-dependent and divergence free, i.e. x и v(t, x) = 0, for all t  0. In order to guarantee the existence of the solution to the SDE (1), we also assume that v(t, x) is Lipschitz

in x. The passive tracer model (1) has many applications in physical and engineering sciences, including atmosphere science, ocean science, chemical engineering, and combustion.
We will study the long-time large-scale behavior of the particle X(t) in the passive tracer model (1), i.e., whether the motion of the particle X(t) has a long-time diffusive limit. Let X(t)  X(t/2) denote the rescaled process of (1). We aim to investigate whether X(t) converge in law to a Brownian motion with a covariance matrix DE  RdОd as   0, where DE is called the effective diffusivity matrix. The dependence of DE on the velocity field of the passive tracer model is complicated and highly nontrivial. There are many theoretical works, where the homogenization theory was applied to study the effective diffusivity matrix DE of the passive tracer model with spatial periodic velocity fields or random velocity fields with short-range correlations; see e.g. [3, 12, 16, 27] and references therein.
For many complicated velocity fields of physical interests, one cannot apply the homogenization theory to compute the corresponding effective diffusivity matrix DE, or even determine its existence. Therefore, many numerical methods were developed to compute DE. These results include, among others, for time-independent Taylor-Green flows, the authors of [28] proposed a stochastic splitting method and calculated the effective diffusivity in the limit of vanishing molecular diffusion. For time-dependent chaotic flows, an efficient model reduction method based on the spectral method was developed to compute DE using the Eulerian framework [21]. The reader is referred to [22] for an extensive review of many existing mathematical theories and numerical simulations for the passive tracer model with different velocity fields.
Recently, we developed a robust structure-preserving Lagrangian scheme to compute the effective diffusivity for chaotic and stochastic flows in [32]. We also obtained a rigorous error estimate for the numerical scheme in [32]. Specifically, let DE,num denote the numerical effective diffusivity obtained by our method. We got the error estimate, ||DE,num - DE||  Ct + C(T )(t)2, where the computational time T should be greater than the diffusion time (also known as mixing time). This error estimate is not sharp in the sense that the pre-factor C(T ) may grow fast with respect to T , since the error estimation is based on a Gronwall inequality technique. Later, we obtained a sharp convergence rate for our numerical scheme and got rid of the term C(T ) in the error estimate in [31]. However, this result only holds for the passive tracer models with time-independent flows.
In this paper, we aim to obtain a sharp convergence analysis for our numerical scheme in computing the effective diffusivity of passive tracer models in spatial-temporal periodic velocity fields. These types of flow fields are well-known for exhibiting chaotic streamlines and have many applications in turbulent diffusion [22]. Since in this case the velocity field depends on the temporal variable, the generator associated with the stochastic process, i.e. the solution X(t) in Eq.(1) becomes non-autonomous. The generator is now a parabolic-type operator (see Eq.(3)), instead of an elliptic-type operator that was studied in [31] when the flows are timeindependent. The uniqueness only happens regarding each time period. Hence the extension of the analysis developed in [31] to time-dependent flows is not straightforward. We will develop new techniques to overcome this difficulty; see Theorem 4.3 and Lemma 4.5 in Section 4. We also emphasize that when the flows are time-independent, we can construct the ballistic orbits of the ABC flows and Kolmogorov flows and study their dynamic behaviors. When the flows
2

are time-dependent, however, their streamlines are complicated, which makes it is difficult to construct the orbits of these flows.
Though there are several prior works on structure-preserving schemes for ODEs and SDEs, see e.g.[14, 15, 30, 1, 20] and references therein, our work has several novel contributions. The first novelty is the convergence analysis, where we develop new techniques to deal with timedependent flows. To handle the parabolic-type generator, we pile up snapshots of each time step within a single time period together. By viewing the numerical solutions as a Markov process and exploring the ergodicity of the solution process, we succeed in obtaining a sharp convergence analysis for our method in computing the effective diffusivity, where the error estimate does not depend on the computational time. Therefore, we can compute the long-time solutions of passive tracer models without losing accuracy; see Fig.2 and Fig.4. If we choose the Gronwall inequality in the error estimate, we cannot get rid of the exponential growth prefactor in the error term, which makes the convergence analysis not sharp. Most importantly, our convergence result reveals the equivalence of the definition of effective diffusivity using the Eulerian framework and the Lagrangian framework; see Theorem 4.8, which is fundamental and important. For 3D time-dependent flow problems, the Eulerian framework has good theoretical value but the Lagrangian framework is computationally accessible.
Another novelty is that the stochastic structure-preserving Lagrangian scheme is robust and quite cheap in computing the long-time solutions of the passive tracer model (1), especially for problems in three-dimensional space. If one adopts the Eulerian framework to compute the effective diffusivity of the passive tracer model (1), one needs to solve a convection-diffusiontype cell problem; see Eq.(5). When the molecular diffusivity  is small and/or the dimension of spatial variables is big, say d = 3, it is exorbitantly expensive to solve the cell problems. As indicated in Eq.(6), the effective diffusivities depend on the integration of the gradient of the solution to the cell problem. In many cases, e.g. time-dependent ABC flow, the effective diffusivities grows up rapidly as  decreases; see Fig.5. In our Lagrangian approach, we can overcome the difficulties of long-time integration of the SDEs (raised as  decreases) by using robust structure-preserving schemes. However, for the Eulerian approach, one needs to solve a four-dimensional PDE (three variables in space dimension and one variable in the time dimension) and solutions have sharp gradients as the diffusivity decreases, which makes the Eulerian approach for computing effective diffusivities expensive.
Numerical results show that our Lagrangian scheme is insensitive to the molecular diffusivity  and computational cost linearly depends on the dimension d of spatial variables in the passive tracer models (1). Thus, we are able to investigate the convection-enhanced diffusion phenomenon for several typical time-dependent chaotic flows of physical interests, including the time-dependent ABC flow and the time-dependent Kolmogorov flow in three-dimensional space. We discover that the maximal enhancement is achieved in the former case, while a submaximal enhancement is observed in the latter case; see Fig.5 and Fig.3, respectively. In addition, we find that the level of chaos and the strength of diffusion enhancement seem to compete with each other in the time-dependent ABC flow; see Fig.6. To the best of our knowledge, our work appears to be the first one in the literature to develop numerical methods to study the convection-enhanced diffusion phenomenon in 3D time-dependent flows.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give the definition of the effective diffusivity matrix using the Eulerian framework and the Lagrangian framework. In Section 3, we propose the stochastic structure-preserving Lagrangian scheme in computing effective diffusivity for the passive tracer model (1). In Section 4, we provide a sharp convergence analysis for the proposed method based on a probabilistic approach. In addition, we shall show that our method can be used to solve high-dimensional flow problems and the error estimate can be obtained naturally. In Section 5, we present numerical results to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our method. We also investigate the convection-enhanced diffusion phenomenon for time-dependent chaotic flows. Concluding remarks are made in Section 6.

2. Effective diffusivity of the passive tracer models
There are two frameworks to define the effective diffusivity of the passive tracer models. We first discuss the Eulerian framework. One natural way to study the expectation of the paths for the SDE given by the Eq.(1) is to consider its associated backward Kolmogorov equation [26]. Due to the time-dependence nature of the velocity field, we need to deal with a space-time ergodic random flow. Specifically, given a sufficiently smooth function (, x) in R О Rd, let u(t, , x) = E (t + , Xt+ )|X = x and X(t) be the solution to Eq.(1). Then, u(t, , x) satisfies the following backward Kolmogorov equation

ut = Lu, u(0, , x) = (, x).

(2)

In Eq.(2), the generator L is defined as

Lu =  u + v и xu + D0xu,

(3)

where D0 = 2/2 is the diffusion coefficient, v is the velocity field, and x and x denote the gradient operator and Laplace operator, respectively.
Remark 2.1. Let (t, , x) denote the density function of the particle (t + , X(t +  )) of Eq.(1). One can define the adjoint operator L as L = -  -  и (v) + D0. Then,  satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation t = L with the initial density (t, , x) = 0(, x).
When v is incompressible (i.e. x и v(t, x) = 0, t), deterministic and space-time periodic in O(1) scale, where we assume the period of v is 1 in each dimension of the physical and temporal space, the formula for the effective diffusivity matrix is [3, 27]

DE = D0I + v(t, x)  (t, x) p,

(4)

where we have assumed that the fluid velocity v(t, x) is smooth and the (vector) corrector field  satisfies the cell problem,

L = -v(t, y), (t, y)  T О Td,

(5)

and и p denotes temporal and spatial average over T О Td. Since v is incompressible, the solution  to the cell problem (5) is unique up to an additive constant by the Fredholm

4

alternative. By multiplying  to Eq.(5), integrating the corresponding result in T О Td and using the periodic conditions of  and v, we get an equivalent formula for the effective diffusivity as follows

DE = D0I + (t, x)  (t, x) p.

(6)

The correction to D0I in Eq.(6) is nonnegative definite. We can see that eT DEe  D0 for all unit column vectors e  Rd, which is called convection-enhanced diffusion. By using
a variational principle for time-periodic velocity flows, one can find a upper bound for the effective diffusivity, i.e., there exists a nonzero unit column vector e  Rd, such that

eT DEe

as D0  0,

(7)

which is known as the maximal enhancement. More details of the derivation can be found in [4, 24, 9]. We point out that many theoretical results were built upon the passive tracer models with time-independent flows. We are interested in studying the convection-enhanced diffusion phenomenon for time-dependent chaotic flows in this paper. Especially, whether the time-dependent chaotic flows still have the maximal enhancement.
In practice, the cell problem (5) can be solved using numerical methods, such as finite element methods and spectral methods. However, when D0 becomes extremely small, the solutions of the cell problem (5) develop sharp gradients and demand a large number of finite element basis or Fourier basis to resolve, which makes the Eulerian framework expensive. In addition, when the dimension of spatial variables is big, say d = 3, the Eulerian framework becomes expensive too.
Alternatively, one can use the Lagrangian framework to compute the effective diffusivity matrix, which is defined as follows,

xi(t) - xi(0))(xj(t) - xj(0)

(8)

where X(t) = (x1(t), ..., xd(t))T is the position of a particle tracer at time t and the average и is taken over an ensemble of particles. If the above limit exists, that means the transport of the particle is a standard diffusion process, at least on a long-time scale. For example, when the velocity field is the Taylor-Green velocity field [9, 28], the long-time and large-scale behavior of the passive tracer model is a diffusion process. However, there are cases showing that the spreading of particles does not grow linearly with time but has a power-law t, where  > 1 and  < 1 correspond to super-diffusive and sub-diffusive behaviors, respectively; see e.g. [4, 22, 2].
We shall use the Lagrangian framework in this paper. The Lagrangian framework has the advantages that: (1) it is easy to implement; (2) it does not directly suffer from a small molecular diffusion coefficient  during the computation; and (3) its computational cost only linearly depends on the dimension of spatial variables in the passive tracer models. However, the major difficulty in solving Eq.(1) is that the computational time should be long enough to approach the diffusion time scale. To address this challenge, we shall develop robust numerical

5

schemes, which are structure-preserving and accurate for long-time integration. Moreover, we aim to develop the convergence analysis of the proposed numerical schemes. Finally, we shall investigate the relationship between parameters of the time-dependent chaotic flows and the corresponding effective diffusivity.

3. Stochastic structure-preserving schemes

3.1. Derivation of numerical schemes
To demonstrate the main idea, we first construct stochastic structure-preserving schemes for a two-dimensional passive tracer model. The derivation of the numerical schemes for high-dimensional passive tracer models will be discussed in Section 4.5. Specifically, let X = (x1, x2)T denote the position of the particle, then the model can be written as

dx1 = v1dt + dw1,t, x1(0) = x1,0,

(9)

dx2 = v2dt + dw2,t, x2(0) = x2,0,

where wi,t, i = 1, 2 are independent Brownian motions. We assume that v = (v1, v2)T is divergence-free and mean-zero at any time t, i.e.,

 и v := x1v1 + x2v2 = 0 t,

(10)

and

T v1(t, x1, x2)dx2 = 0 x1, t,

(11)

T v2(t, x1, x2)dx1 = 0 x2, t,

where T = [0, 1]. We also assume that v is smooth and its first-order derivatives vi(t, x1, x2), i = 1, 2 are bounded. These conditions are necessary to guarantee the existence and uniqueness

of solutions of the SDE (9); see [26]. Moreover, we assume that the diagonal of the Jacobian of

the velocity field v = (v1, v2)T are all zeros. A typical example is a Hamiltonian system with a separable Hamiltonian, i.e., there exists H(t, x1, x2) = H1(t, x1) + H2(t, x2) such that,

v1 = -x2H, v2 = x1H.

(12)

In this paper, we denote with slightly abuse of notation that v1(t, x2) = v1(t, x1, x2) and v2(t, x1) = v2(t, x1, x2). These notations simplify our derivation. Whenever a statement corresponds to v1(t, x2) (or v2(t, x1)) is made, it is equivalent to that for v1(t, x1, x2) (or v2(t, x1, x2)).
In [32], we proposed a stochastic structure-preserving scheme based on a Lie-Trotter splitting scheme to solve the SDE (9). Specifically, we split the problem (9) into a deterministic subproblem,

dx1 = v1(t, x2)dt,

(13)

dx2 = v2(t, x1)dt,

which is solved by using a symplectic-preserving scheme (e.g., the symplectic Euler scheme for deterministic equations with frozen time), and a stochastic subproblem,

dx1 = dw1,t,

(14)

dx2 = dw2,t,

6

which is solved by using the Euler-Maruyama scheme [26]. Notice that when  is a constant
in (14), the Euler-Maruyama scheme exactly solves Eq.(14)
Now we discuss how to discretize Eq.(9). From time t = tn to time t = tn+1, where tn+1 = tn+t, t0 = 0, and t is the time step, we assume the numerical solution Xn = (xn1 , xn2 )T is given, which approximates the exact solution X(tn) to the SDE (9) at time tn = nt. Then, we apply the Lie-Trotter splitting method to solve the SDE (9) and obtain,

random variables. In this paper, we view the solution sequence Xn = (xn1 , xn2 )T , n = 1, 2, 3, ...,

generated by the scheme (15) as a discrete Markov stochastic process, which enables us to use

techniques from stochastic process to obtain a sharp convergence analysis for the numerical

solutions; see Section 4.

In a 2D Hamiltonian system, when the system contains an additive temporal noise, the

noise itself is considered to be symplectic pathwise [25]. Therefore, we state that the scheme

(15) is stochastic symplectic-preserving since it preserves symplecticity. Specifically, the scheme

(15) can be viewed as a composition of two symplectic transforms. In addition, we know that

the numerical solution converges to the exact one as the time step t approaches zero. In

high-dimensional systems, a structure-preserving scheme refers to a volume-preserving scheme;

see Section 4.5.

3.2. The backward Kolmogorov equation and related results We first define the backward Kolmogorov equation associated with the Eq.(9) as

ut = Lu, u(0, , x) = (, x),

(16)

where the generator L associated with the Markov process in Eq.(9) is given by

L

=



+

v1(, x2)x1

+

v2(, x1)x2

+

2 2

(x1

x1

+

x2x2 ).

(17)

Recall that the solution u(t, , x) to the Eq.(16) satisfies, u(t, , x) = E (t + , Xt+ )|X = x where Xt is the solution to Eq.(9) and  is a smooth function in R1 О R2. In other words,

u(t, , x) is the flow generated by the original SDE (9).

Similarly, we can study the flow generated by the stochastic structure-preserving scheme

(15). According to the splitting method used in the derivation of the scheme in Section 3.1,

we

define

and

Starting

from u(0, и, и), during one time step t, we compute



tu1 = L1u1, u1(0, и, и) = u(0, и, и),



tu2

u2(0,

u5(0,

u4(

7

Then, u5(t, и, и) will be the flow at time t = t generated by our stochastic structurepreserving scheme (15) and it approximates the solution u(t, и, и) to the Eq.(16) well when t is small. It is also worth mentioning that, u3(t, и, и) is the exact flow generated by the deterministic symplectic Euler scheme in solving Eq.(13). We repeat this process to compute the flow equations of our scheme at other time steps, which approximate the solution u(nt, и, и), n = 2, 3, ... to the Eq.(16) at different time steps.
Remark 3.1. Given the operators Li, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, there are many possible choices in setting the coefficients for each operator Li and designing the splitting method; see Section 2.5 of [14]. Eq.(18) is a simple choice that was used in this paper.
To analyze the error between the flow operator in Eq.(16) and the composition of operators in Eq.(18), we shall resort to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula, which is widely used in non-commutative algebra [13]. For example, in the matrix theory,

exp(tA) exp(tB) = exp

t(A

+

B)

+

t2

[A, B] 2

+

t3 12

A, [A, B] + B, [B, A]

+ и и и , (19)

where t is a scalar, A and B are two square matrices of the same size, [, ] is the Lie-Bracket, and the remaining terms on the right hand side are all nested Lie-brackets.
In our analysis, we replace the matrices in Eq.(19) by differential operators and the BCH formula yields critical insights into the particular structure of the splitting error. Let It denote the composite flow operator associated with Eq.(18), i.e.,

Itu(0,

и,

и)

:=

exp(tL4)

exp(

t 2

L1)

exp(tL3)

exp(tL2)

exp(

t 2

L1)u(0,

и,

и).

(20)

Notice that after propagating time t = t, the exact solution to the Eq.(16) started at any  can be represented as

u(t, и, и) = exp(tL)u(0, и, и) = exp t(L1 + L2 + L3 + L4) u(0, и, и).

(21)

Therefore, we can apply the BCH formula to analyze the error between the original flow and

the approximated flow. Moreover, we find that computing the k-th order modified equation

associated with Eq.(9) in the backward error analysis (BEA) [29, 7] is equivalent to computing

the terms of BCH formula up to order (t)k in the Eq.(20). To show that the solution generated

by Eq.(15) follows a perturbed Hamiltonian system (with divergence-free velocity and additive

noise) at any order k, we only need to consider the (k + 1)-nested Lie bracket consisting of

 , v1x1 ,

v2x2 ,

2 2

(x1

x1

+

x2x2 )

and we can easily see that they generate divergence-free

fields.

We remark that given any explicit splitting scheme for deterministic systems, by adding

additive noise we shall obtain a similar form of flow propagation. And we shall see in later

proof that, such operator formulation is very effective in analyzing the order of convergence

and volume-preserving property.

4. Convergence analysis
In this section, we prove the convergence rate of our stochastic structure-preserving schemes in computing effective diffusivity based on a probabilistic approach, which allows us to get rid of the exponential growth factor in the error estimate. We first limit our analysis to 2D separable Hamiltonian velocity fields. Then, in Section 4.5 we will show that all the derivations can be generalized to high-dimensional cases.
4.1. Convergence to an invariant measure To compute the effective diffusivity of a passive tracer model using a Lagrangian numerical scheme is closely related to study the limit of a solution sequence (a stochastic process) generated by the numerical scheme. Therefore, we can apply the results from ergodic theory to study the convergence behaviors of the solution.
Let (S, ) be a probability space, on which a family P (x, E), x  S, E  , of probability measure is defined. We assume x  P (x, E) is measurable, E  . This corresponds to a linear bounded operator on B(S), which is the space of bounded measurable functions on S. This operator, denoted by P , is defined by,

P (x) = P (x, dz)(z),   B(S).

(22)

S

Clearly ||P ||  1. One of the main objectives of ergodic theory is to study the limit of the operator sequence P n as n  +. The result can be summarized into the following proposition, which plays a fundamental role in our convergence analysis.

Proposition 4.1 (Theorem 3.3.1 of [3]). We assume that,
1. S is a compact metric space and  is the Borel -algebra; 2. there exists a probability measure х on (S, ) such that P (x, E) = E p(x, y)х(dy); 3. p(x, y) : S О S  R+ is continuous; 4. there exists a ball U0 such that х(U0) > 0 and a positive number  > 0 (depending on U0)
such that p(x, y)  , x  S, y  U0.
Then, there exists one and only one invariant probability measure  on (S, ) and one has,

sup P n(x) - (dx)  C||||e-n,   B(S),

Now we study the convergence behaviors of the solution generated by our stochastic structurepreserving scheme (15). We first prove a lemma as follows.

Lemma 4.2. Let Y~ = R2/Z2 denote the physical torus space and T be the time periodic space. Let I,1+ denote the transform of the density on Y~ during [, 1 +  ] (time period is 1) using
the numerical scheme (15). In addition, let I,1+ denote the adjoint operator (i.e., the flow operator) of I,1+ in the space of B(Y~ ), which is the set of bounded measurable functions on

9

Y~ . Then, there exists one and only one invariant probability measure on (Y~ , ), denoted by  , satisfying,

sup (I,1+ )n (x) - (x) (dx)  C||||Le-n,   B(Y~ ),

(24)

xY~

where  > 0, C > 0 are independent of (и). Moreover, the kernel space of (Id - I,1+ ) is the constant functions in Y~ , where Id is the identity operator.

Proof. We shall verify that the transition kernel associated with the numerical scheme (15) satisfies the assumptions required by Prop. 4.1. First notice that in the space R2, the integration process associated with the numerical scheme (15) can be expressed as a Markov process with the transition kernel,

where Xn = (xn1 , xn2 )T and Xn+1 = (xn1+1, xn2+1)T are the numerical solutions at time t = tn and t = tn+1, respectively.
Then, using the periodicity of v, we directly extend Eq.(25) to the torus space Y~ as

is compact, the kernel K~ ,+1 is strictly positive. Namely, there exists  > 0 such that K~ ,+1(X0, Xk) >  , (X0, Xk)  Y~ О Y~ . If we apply Prop.4.1 to I,1+ (whose kernel is K~ ,+1), we prove the statement in (24).

Finally, we know that the operator I,1+ is compact since it is an integral operator with

a continuous kernel. By using the Fredholm alternative, we know that dim ker(Id - I,1+ ) =

dim ker(Id - I,1+ ) = 1. Therefore, it is easy to verify that the constant functions are in the

kernel of (Id - I,1+ ).

10

Equipped with the Lemma 4.2, we study the convergence rate of the space-time transition kernel associated with our numerical scheme (15).

Theorem

4.3.

Let

t

=

1 N

,

N

is

a

positive

integer.

We

have

the

following

properties

hold:

(a) Given t, there exists C > 0 and  > 0, such that,

sup INt n(, x) - (, x) (dx)  C||||Le-n,   B(T О Y~ ),

(28)

where C and  do not depend on  and  .

(b) If Y~  = 0, then we get

n

lim E(, XN+i) < ,   T.

(29)

n

i=1

(c) The kernel space of (Id - INt) is c( ) | c( ) is a periodic function in T with period 1 .

Proof. By definition of It and I,1+ in Eq.(20) and Lemma 4.2, we have (It)N (, и) 

I,1+ (, и). To prove the property (a), we need to show that the lower bound of the kernel K~ ,+1, which is defined in the proof of Lemma 4.2, does not depend on  . For all   T, Xn =

(xn1 , xn2 )T



T2

and

Xn+1

(30)

According to the definition of the kernel K~ ,+1; see Eq.(27), we know the minimal value of K~ ,+1 is above zero and is independent of  . Now, we apply this observation to Lemma 4.2 and conclude the proof of the property (a). The property (b) is a simple conclusion of the

exponential decay property proved in (a). For the property (c), we consider the equation

INtw = w. Then, for a given time  , we have I,1+ w(, и) = w(, и). Notice the fact that in Lemma 4.2 the invariant space of I,1+ is constant in the spacial variable. Thus, we obtain
w = w( ).

Before we close this subsection, we provide a convergence result for the inverse of operator sequences, which will be useful in our convergence analysis.

Proposition 4.4. Let X, Y denote two Banach spaces. Assume Tn, T are bounded linear operators from X to Y , satisfying limn ||Tn - T ||B(X,Y ) = 0, and T -1  B(Y, X). Given f  Y , if Tn-1f , n = 1, 2, ... uniquely exist, then we have a convergence estimate as follows,

lim
n

(Tn-1 - T -1)f

= 0.

(31)

11

The proof is quite standard. It can also be viewed as a modification of Theorem 1.16 in Section IV of [17].

4.2. A discrete-type cell problem
In the Eulerian framework, the periodic solution of the cell problem (5) and the corresponding formula for the effective diffusivity (4) play a key role in studying the behaviors of chaotic and stochastic flows. In the Lagrangian framework, we shall define a discrete analogue of cell problem that enables us to compute the effective diffusivity. Let X0 = (x01, x02)T be the initial data and Xn = (xn1 , xn2 )T denote the numerical solution generated by the scheme (15) at tn = nt, i.e.

xn1

=

x1n-1

+

v1

(tn-

1 2

x2n-1)t

xn2 = x2n-1 + v2

(32)

where

N2n-1

 t2,

and

1,

2



N (0, 1) are

i.i.d.

normal

random

variables.

For convenience we have replaced n + 1 by n.

First of all, we show that the solutions xn1 and xn2 obtained by the scheme (32) have bounded expectations if the initial values are bounded. Taking expectation of the first equation of

Eq.(32) on both sides, we obtain

n-1

(33)

As a symplectic scheme in 2D, the numerical scheme (32) admits the uniform measure as its invariant measure. Applying the results (a) and (b) of Theorem 4.3 and using the fact that v is a periodic function with zero mean, we know that,

Notice

that

v1

Xk

)

is

equivalent

to

v1(tk+

1 2

,

xk2

),

since

v1

is

By

applying

triangle inequalities in Eq.(33) and using the result in Eq.(34), we arrive at,

|Exn1 |  |Ex01| + C1||v1||,

(35)

where C1 does not depend on n. Using the same approach, we know that expectation of the

second component Exn2 is also bounded.

Now, we are in the position to define the discrete-type cell problem. Starting at time 

with

time

step

t

=

1 N

,

we

denote

the

starting

time

index

to

be

N.

Then,

we

define



v^1,N (, x) = t

E

v1

(ti+

1 2

+ , XN+i)|XN

=

x

,

i=0

(36)

where the summation is well defined due to the fact stated in Eq.(34). We will show that v^1,N (, x) satisfies the following properties. Namely, v^1,N (, x) is the solution of the discretetype cell problem defined in Eq.(37).

12

Lemma 4.5. According to our assumption on v, we know that v1 is a periodic function with zero mean on Y~ ,  , i.e., Y~ v1 = 0. Therefore, v^1,N (, x) is the unique solution in B0(T О Y~ )

such that

v^1,N (,

x)

=

(Itv^1,N )(,

x)

+

tv1(

+

t 2

,

x),

(37)

where

t =

1 N

and

the operator It

is

defined in

(20).

Moreover,

v^1,N (, x) is

smooth.

Proof. Throughout the proof, we shall use the fact that if X, Y are random processes and Y is measurable under a filtration F , then with appropriate integrability assumption, we have

E[XY ] = E E[XY |F ] = E E[X|F ]Y .

(38)

Some simple calculations will give that

v^1,N (,

(39)

Recall the definition of the operator It in (20), Eq.(39) implies that

v^1,N (,

-

tv1(

+

,

=

(Itv^1,N )(,

(40)

Suppose we have that Itw = w. Then, we get (It)N w = w. According to Theorem 4.3,
we know that w = 0 if Y~ wdx = 0, t. So ker(It - Id) = {0} and v^1,N is unique. Finally, by the definition of v^1,N , we obtain that



v^1,N (, x) =t

(41)

which indicates that v^1,N has the same regularity as v1 does. Notice the kernel K~,+it(x, y) has a fast decay property, which guarantees the order of the differentiation and summation is

interchangeable.

Remark 4.1. Notice that v1 and v^1,N only depend on the second component of the numerical solution Xn = (xn1 , xn2 )T . However, we will write v1 and v^1,N as functions of Xn when we view Xn as a Markov process in the convergence analysis.
Remark 4.2. When the flow is time-independent, we obtain

E[v^1,N (Xn+1)|Xn] - v^1,N (Xn) = -tv1(Xn), a.s. n  N.

(42)

Therefore, the discrete-type cell problem defined in (37) is a generalization of the discrete-type cell problem for time-independent flow problems studied in our previous work [31], although technically it is more involved.

13

In the remaining part of this paper, we only need the result that v^1,N (, x) is unique in an Hеolder space Cp01,p2,(T О Y~ ) B(T О Y~ ). To be precise, given a smooth drift function v1, v^1,N (, x) will be in C0p1,p2,(Y~ ), where p1  2, p2  6, 0 <  < 1 and the subscript index 0 indicates that it is a subspace with zero-mean functions.

4.3. Convergence estimate of the discrete-type cell problem
In this section, we shall prove that the solution v^1,N (, x) of the discrete-type cell problem (i.e., Eq.(37)) converges to the solution of a continuous cell problem in certain subspace. Here, we choose the space C20,6,(T1 О Y~ ) to carry out our analysis. However, there is no requirement that we have to choose this one. In fact, any space that has certain regularity (belongs to the domain of the operator L) will work. Notice that the continuous cell problem (5) is defined for a vector function, where the first component satisfies

L1 = -v1.

(43)

For the two-dimensional problem, the operator L is defined in Eq.(17). Given the fact that

v1 is a smooth Eq.(43) admits

 T1. Then, of parabolic

PDEs in Hеolder space (see, e.g., the Theorem 8.7.3 in [18]). The following theorem states that

under certain conditions the solution of the discrete-type cell problem converges to the solution

of the continuous one.

Theorem 4.6. Assume v1 is a smooth function defined on T1 О Y~ , satisfying Y~ v1(, x)dx = 0,   T1. Let v^1 and 1 be the solutions of the discrete-type cell problem (37) and continuous cell problem (43), respectively. Then, we have the following convergence estimate holds

||1 - v^1|| = O(t),

(44)

where || и || is a function norm associated with the space C02,6,(T1 О Y~ ).

Proof. Using Prop. 4.4, one can easily verify that L is a bijection between two Banach spaces C20,6,(T1 О Y~ ) and C10,4,(T1 О Y~ ) and its inverse is bounded. Integrating Eq.(43) along time
gives,

exp(tL)1 - 1 = -v1t + O (t)2  -tv»1,

(45)

where v»1 = v1 + O(t). Combining Eqns.(40) and (45), we obtain

exp(tL)1 - Itv^1 - (1 - v^1) = t(v1 - v»1).

(46)

Notice that Eq.(46) shows the connection between 1 and v^1. After some simple calculations,

we get that

L(1 - v^1) = (L - L~1)(1 - v^1) + L~2v^1 + (v1 - v»1),

(47)

where

L~1

=

exp(tL) t

-

Id ,

and

L~2

=

It

-

exp(tL) t

.

(48)

14

Moreover, we can verify that in the space of bounded linear operators from C02,6,(Y~ ) to C10,4,(Y~ ), there is a strong convergence in the operator norm || и ||,

||L - L~1|| = O(t) as t  0.

(49)

For the operator L~2, noticing that L = L1 + L2 + L3 + L4 and operator It is defined in (20), we can use the BCH formula and obtain

exp L~2 =

(t)2 2

[L4, L3] + [L4, L2] + [L4, L1] + [L3, L2] + [L2, L1] + [L3, L1]

(51)

In addition, combining the results of the Eqns.(45), (49), (50) and (51) for the right hand side of Eq.(47), we know that when t is small enough, the assertion in (44) is proved. The constant in the O(t) of (44) does not depend on the total computational time T , but may depend on the regularities of v1, v2 and the constant .

4.4. Convergence analysis for the effective diffusivity
This section contains the main results of our convergence analysis. We first prove that the second-order moment of the solution obtained by using our numerical scheme has an (at most) linear growth rate. Secondly, we provide the convergence rate of our numerical method in computing the effective diffusivity.

Theorem 4.7. Let Xn = (xn1 , xn2 )T denote the solution of the two-dimensional passive tracer model (9) obtained by using our numerical scheme (32) with time step t. If the Hamiltonian
function H(t, x1, x2) is separable, periodic and smooth (in order to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the SDE (9)), then we can prove that the second-order moment of the solution Xn (which can be viewed as a discrete Markov process) is at most linear growth,

i.e.,

max n

||Xn||2 En

is bounded.

(52)

Proof. We first estimate the second-order moment of the first component of Xn = (xn1 , xn2 )T , since the other one can be estimated in the same manner. Simple calculations show that

E[(xn1 )2|(x1n-1, x2n-1)] = E

(53)

The

corresponds

to

the

strength

of

the

convection-enhanced

diffu-

sion. Our goal here is to prove that it is bounded over n, though it may depend on v1, v2 and

15

. Notice that we are calculating the expectation of (xn1 )2, which is not defined in the torus

space. But in the following derivation, we will show that it can be decomposed into sums of

periodic functions acting on Xn = (xn1 , xn2 )T . Hence after the decomposition (see Eq.(56)) we

can still apply the previous analysis on torus space.

We

now

compute

(57)

Notice that if v1 and v^1 are bounded in sup norm, right-hand-side of Eq.(57) is bounded for any n. Other terms on the right-hand side of Eq.(56) are also bounded, which can be checked

16

easily.

Therefore,

we

can

prove

that

1 n

E

(xn1 )2|(x01, x02)

is bounded. Repeat the same trick, we

know

that

1 n

E

(xn2 )2|(x01, x02)

is also bounded. Thus, the assertion in Eq.(52) is proved.

In practice, we shall first choose a time step t and run our numerical scheme (15) to

compute the effective diffusivity until the result converges to a constant, which may depend

on t. As such, we shall prove that the limit of the constant converges to the exact effective

diffusivity of the original passive tracer model as t approaches zero. Namely, we shall prove

that our numerical scheme is robust in computing effective diffusivity. More details on the

numerical results will be given in Section 5.

Theorem 4.8. Let xn1 , n = 0, 1, .... be the first component of the numerical solution obtained by using the scheme (15) and t denote the time step. We have the convergence estimate of
the effective diffusivity as

lim

(58)

where the constant in O(t) may depend on the regularity of v1, v2 and the constant , but

does not depend on the computational time T .

Proof. We will prove the statement by direct computation. We divide both sides of the Eq.(56) by t and obtain

Therefore, we only need to focus on the estimate of terms in the second line of Eq.(59),

which corresponds to the convection-enhanced diffusion effect. Notice that v^1  C2,6,, we compute the Ito-Taylor series approximation of v^1(ti, Xi),

v^1(ti, Xi) = v^1(ti-1, Xi-1) + v^1,x1 (ti-1, Xi-1)

where we have used the facts that: (1) Xi-1 is independent of N1i-1 and N2i-1 so the expectations of the corresponding terms vanish; (2) N1i-1 and N2i-1 are independent so E(N1i-1N2i-1) = 0; and (3) E(N1i-1)2 = t.
Finally, by using the Theorem 4.3 and noticing the invariant measure is the uniform mea-
sure, we obtain from Eq.(59) that

lim
n

1 nt

E

(xn1 )2|(x01, x02)

= 2 + 2

(v^1v1 + 2v^1,x1) + O(t).

(64)

Thus, our statement in the Eq.(58) is proved using the facts that v^1 converges to 1 (see Theorem 4.6) and v^1,x1 = 0.
Remark 4.3. If we divide two on both sides of the Eq.(58), we can find that our result recovers the definition of the effective diffusivity D1E1 defined in the Eq.(4). Recall that D0 = 2/2. Theorem 4.8 reveals the connection of the definition of the effective diffusivity using the Eulerian framework and Lagrangian framework; see Eq.(4) and Eq.(8), which is fundamental in this context. For 3D time-dependent flow problems, the Eulerian framework has good theoretical values but the Lagrangian framework is computationally accessible.
Remark 4.4. For the second component of the numerical solution, i.e., xn2 , n = 0, 1, ..., we can obtain the similar convergence result in computing the effective diffusivity. First we consider v~2(t, x1, x2) := v2(t, x1 + v1(t, x2)t) and notice that v~2 - v2 = O(t) and T v~2dx1 = 0. The remaining part of the proof is essentially the same as the results obtained in Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4, so we skip the details here.

4.5. Generalizations to high-dimensional cases To show the essential idea of our probabilistic approach in proving the convergence rate of the numerical schemes, we have carried out our convergence analysis based on a two-dimensional

18

model problem (9). In fact, the extension of our approach to higher-dimensional problems is straightforward. Now we consider a high-dimensional problem as follow,

dX = v(t, X)dt + dw(t),

(65)

where X = (x1, x2, и и и , xd)T  Rd is the position of a particle, v = (v1, v2, и и и , vd)T  Rd is the Eulerian velocity field at position X,  is a d О d constant non-singular matrix, and w(t) is a d-dimension Brownian motion vector. In particular, we assume the component vi does not depend on xi, i = 1, ..., d. Thus, the incompressible condition for v(t, X) (i.e. X и v(t, X) = 0) is easily guaranteed.
For a deterministic and divergence-free dynamical system, Feng et. al. proposed a volumepreserving method [10], which splits a d-dimensional problem into d - 1 subproblems with each of them being a two-dimensional problem and thus being volume-preserving. We shall modify Feng's method (first-order case) by including the randomness as the last subproblem to take into account the additive noise, i.e.,

where X = (x1, each component

d-dimensional independent random vector with 1), and Xn = (xn1 , xn2 , и и и, xnd )T is the numerical

approximation to the exact solution X(tn) to the SDE (65) at time tn = nt.

The techniques of the convergence analysis for the two-dimensional problem can be applied

to high-dimensional problems without much difficulty. For the high-dimensional problem (65),

the smoothness and strict positivity of the transition kernel in the discrete process can be

guaranteed if one assumes that the covariance matrix  is non-singular and the scheme (66)

is explicit. According to our assumption for the velocity field, the scheme (66) is volume-

preserving for each step. Thus, the solution to the first-order modified equation is divergence-

free and the invariant measure on the torus (defined by Rd/Zd, when the period is 1) remains

uniform for all t. Finally, the convergence of the cell problem can be studied by using the

BCH formula (19) with d + 2 differential operators. Recall that in the Eq.(20) we have four

differential operators when we study the two-dimensional problem.

Therefore, our numerical methods are robust in computing effective diffusivity for high-

dimensional problems, which will be demonstrated through time-dependent chaotic flow prob-

lems in three-dimensional space in Section 5.

5. Numerical results In this section, we will present numerical examples to verify the convergence analysis of the proposed method in computing effective diffusivity for time-dependent chaotic flows. In addi-
19

tion, we will investigate the convection-enhanced diffusion phenomenon in 3D time-dependent

flow, i.e., the time-dependent ABC flow and the time-dependent Kolmogorov flow. Without

loss

of

generality,

we

compute

the

quantity

, E(x1(T ))2 2T

which

is

used

to

approximate

D1E1

in

the

effective diffusivity matrix (4).

5.1. Verification of the convergence rate
We first consider a two-dimensional passive tracer model. Let (x1, x2)T  R2 denote the position of a particle. Its motion is described by the following SDE,

dx1 = sin 4x2 + 1 + sin(2t) exp cos 4x2 + 1 + sin(2t) dt + dw1,t,

(67)

dx2 = cos 2x1 + sin(2t) exp sin 2x1 + sin(2t) dt + dw2,t,

 where  = 2 О 0.1, wi,t, i = 1, 2 are independent Brownian motions, and the initial data (x01, x02)T follows uniform distributions in [-0.5, 0.5]2. One can easily verify the velocity field in (67) is time-dependent and divergence-free.

In our numerical experiments, we use Monte Carlo samples to discretize the Brownian

motions w1,t and w2,t.

The sample number is denoted by Nmc.

We choose tref

=

1 212

and

Nmc = 3, 200, 000 to solve the SDE (67) to compute the reference solution, i.e., the "exact"

effective diffusivity, where the final computational time is T = 3000 so that the calculated

effective diffusivity converges to a constant. In fact, we find that the passive tracer model will

enter a mixing stage if the computational time is bigger than T = 1000. It takes about 17

hours to compute the reference solution on a 80-core server (HPC2015 System at HKU). The

reference solution for the effective diffusivity is D1E1 = 0.219.

In Fig.1(a), we plot the convergence results of the effective diffusivity using our method

(i.e.,

) E(x1(T ))2 2T

with

respective

to

different

time-step

t

at

T

= 3000.

In addition, we show

a fitted straight line with the slope 1.04, i.e., the convergence rate is about (t)1.04. This

numerical result verifies the convergence analysis in Theorem 4.8.

20

To further study the accuracy and robustness of our method for long-time integration, we consider a 3D time-dependent Kolmogorov flow problem. Let (x1, x2, x3)T  R3 denote the position of a particle. The motion of a particle moving in the 3D time-dependent Kolmogorov
flow is described by the following SDE,



dx1 = sin x3 +  sin(2t) dt + dw1,t,



dx2 = sin x1 +  sin(2t) dt + dw2,t,

(68)

 dx3 = sin x2 +  sin(2t) dt + dw3,t.

where w1,t, w2,t and w3,t are independent Brownian motions. When  = 0, the velocity field in (68) corresponds to the Kolmogorov flow [11]. The Kolmogorov flow possesses very chaotic

behaviors [6], which brings challenges for our method.



In our numerical experiment, we choose  = 10-1 and  = 2 О 10-3 in the Eq.(68). We

choose

tref

=

1 2048

and

Nmc

=

480, 000

to

compute

the

reference

solution

for

the

SDE

(68),

i.e., the "exact" effective diffusivity. In our numerical tests, we find that the passive tracer

model will enter a mixing stage if the computational time is bigger than T = 2000. To show

the accuracy and robustness of our numerical scheme, we set T = 105 here. It takes about

59 hours to compute the reference solution on the server and the reference solution for the

effective diffusivity is D1E1 = 0.693. In Fig.1(b), we plot the convergence results of the effective diffusivity using our method

with respect to different time-step t. In addition, we show a fitted straight line with the slope

1.22, i.e., the convergence rate is about (t)1.22. This numerical result again agrees with our

error analysis.

5.2. Investigation of the convection-enhanced diffusion phenomenon

As we have already demonstrated in Section 5.1, our method is very accurate and robust for

long-time integration. Here, we will study the dependence of the effective diffusivity D1E1 on different parameters in the time-dependent flows. First of all, we solve Eq.(68) and carry out

the test for the 3D time-dependent Kolmogorov flow.

In

Fig.2,

we

show

the

time

evolution

of

E(x1 (t))2 2t

for

(here

D0

=

2/2)

and

for four different 's, where the result in Fig.2(d) corresponding to the time-independent Kol-

mogorov flow (see Figure 6 of [31]). Notice that in Eq.(68) the parameter  controls the strength

of the time dependence. For each D0 and , we use Nmc = 240, 000 particles to solve the SDE

(68).

We

find

that

for

each

given

D0,

the

time

evolution

of

E(x1(t))2 2t

converges

as



approaches

zero. This can be rigorously justified through analysis; see Appendix A. In addition, we ob-

serve a certain amount of enhanced diffusion when D0 decreases. However, the dependency of D1E1 on D0 is quite different from the pattern of the time-dependent ABC flow, which is known as the maximal enhancement and will be discussed later; see Fig.5.

To study the dependence of D1E1 on D0 and , we choose different 's and D0's and compute the corresponding effective diffusivity D1E1. In this experiment, we use t = 2-7 and Nmc = 240, 000 particles to compute. The final computational time is T = 105 so that the particles

are fully mixed. We show the numerical results in Fig.3.

21

We find that for each given D0 as  decreases the corresponding effective diffusivity D1E1 converges to the effective diffusivity D1E1 associated with  = 0. This means the time dependency of  improves the chaotic property of Kolmorogov flow though, it does not change the pattern
of convection-enhanced diffusion in the Kolmogorov flow. When   1 the fitted slope within D0  [10-5, 10-3] is -0.2, which indicates that D1E1  O(1/D00.2). We call this behavior a submaximal enhancement, which may be explained by the fact that the Kolmogorov flow is more
chaotic than the ABC flow [11]. The chaotic trajectories in Kolmogorov flow enhance diffusion
much less than channel-like structures such as the ballistic orbits of ABC flows [23, 33].

Next, we use our stochastic structure-preserving scheme to solve time-dependent ABC flow problems. Let (x1, x2, x3)T  R3 denote the position of a particle in the 3D Cartesian coordinate system. The motion of a particle moving in the 3D time-dependent ABC flow is described by

the following SDE,



dx1 = A sin x3 +  sin(2t) dt + C cos x2 +  sin(2t) dt + dw1,t,



dx2 = B sin x1 +  sin(2t) dt + A cos x3 +  sin(2t) dt + dw2,t,

(69)

 dx3 = C sin x2 +  sin(2t) dt + B cos x1 +  sin(2t) dt + dw3,t,

where w1,t, w2,t and w3,t are independent Brownian motions. For  = 0 and  = 0, the velocity field in (69) corresponds to the standard ABC flow [8]. The ABC flow is a three-dimensional

incompressible velocity field which is an exact solution to the Euler's equation. It is notable as a

simple example of a fluid flow that can have chaotic trajectories. In our numerical experiments,

we set A = B = C = 1.

In

we

the

and

for four different 's, where the result in Fig.4(d) corresponding to the time-independent ABC

flow (see Figure 3 of [31]). Again the parameter  controls the strength of the time dependence.

For each D0 and , we use Nmc = 240, 000 particles to solve the SDE (69). We find that for

each

given

D0,

the

time

evolution

of

the

E(x1 (t))2 2t

converges

converges

zero.

However,

we observe two different patterns compared with the results shown in Fig.2. First, when we

decrease D0, it takes a longer time for the system to enter a mixing stage. Second, we observe
a large amount of enhanced diffusion when D0 decreases.
To further investigate the dependence of D1E1 on D0 and , we choose different 's and D0's and compute the corresponding effective diffusivity D1E1. In this experiment, we use t = 2-7 and Nmc = 240, 000 particles to compute. The final computational time is T = 105 so that the

particles are fully mixed.

In Fig.5, we show the numerical results. We find that for each given D0, as  decreases the corresponding effective diffusivity D1E1 converges to the effective diffusivity D1E1 associated with  = 0. Thus, the time-dependent ABC flow has a similar convection-enhanced diffusion

behavior as the time-independent ABC flow. The fitted slope within D0  [10-5, 10-1] is about

23

-1.0, which indicates that D1E1  O(1/D01). This result indicates that the D1E1 of the timedependent ABC flow achieves the upper-bound of Eq.(7), i.e. the maximal enhancement. This

maximal enhancement phenomenon may be attributed to the ballistic orbits of the ABC flow,

where the time-independent case was discussed in [23, 33].

Moreover, our result for D0  [10-3, 10-1] and  = 0 recovers the same phenomenon as the Fig.2 in [4], which was obtained by using the Eulerian framework, i.e., solving a cell problem. In

Fig.5, our method can be easily used to compute the effective diffusivity when D0  [10-5, 10-4]. It will be, however, extremely expensive for the Eulerian framework since one needs to solve a

Finally, we investigate the dependence of D1E1 on the frequency of the time-dependent ABC flow. Specifically, we solve the following SDE,

where A = B = C = 1 and  is the frequency. Here we first choose t = 2-7, Nmc = 240, 000 and T = 105. Then, we choose different  and compute the corresponding effective diffusivity D1E1.
In Fig.6, we show the numerical results. We find that when  is near 0.1 the diffusion enhancement is weak. When  is away from 0.1, say  < 0.05 or  > 0.2, we observe the maximal enhancement phenomenon. A similar sensitive dependence on the frequency of timedependent ABC flows was reported in [5], where the Lyapunov exponent of the deterministic time-dependent ABC flow problem (i.e.,  = 0 in Eq. (69)) was studied as the indicator of the extent of chaos; see Fig.2 and Fig.3 of [5].
When  = 0, the flow of (70) is the same as that for  = 0 case in (69), which will give the maximal enhancement phenomenon. When  is positive, the flow becomes time-dependent and the regions of chaos expand until the extent of chaos (i.e. the Lyapunov exponent) appears to reach a maximum, which is corresponding to  = 0.1. It seems that the diffusion enhancement is significantly weakened in this range of . When  continues to grow, the islands of the integrability regrow and the chaotic regions have shrunk significantly. We again observe the maximal enhancement phenomenon in this range of . Our numerical results suggest that the level of chaos and the strength of diffusion enhancement seem to compete with each other. More intensive theoretic and numerical studies will be reported in our future work.

6. Conclusion
In this paper, we developed a robust stochastic structure-preserving Lagrangian scheme in computing effective diffusivity of passive tracer models and provided a sharp convergence analysis on the proposed numerical scheme. Our convergence analysis is based on a probabilistic approach, which interprets the solution process generated by our numerical scheme as a Markov process. By exploring the ergodicity of the solution process, we gave a sharp and uniformin-time error estimate for our numerical scheme, which allows us to compute the effective diffusivity over infinite time. Numerical results verify that the proposed method is robust

and accurate in computing effective diffusivity of time-dependent chaotic flows. We observed the maximal enhancement phenomenon in time-dependent ABC flows and the sub-maximal enhancement phenomenon in time-dependent Kolmogorov flows, respectively. Moreover, we found that the time dependency in the velocity field improves the chaotic property of ABC flow and Kolmorogov flow though, it does not change the pattern of convection-enhanced diffusion in both flows.
There are two directions we plan to explore in our future work. First, we intend to study the convection-enhanced diffusion phenomenon and provide a sharp convergence analysis for general time-dependent chaotic flows, where the flows have a quasi-periodic property in the time domain. In addition, we shall investigate the convection-enhanced diffusion phenomenon for general spatial-temporal stochastic flows [19, 22] and develop convergence analysis for the corresponding numerical methods.

Appendix A. Limit of the parameter  in a time-dependent chaotic flow
We shall prove that when  approaches zero, the effective diffusivity corresponding to the timedependent chaotic flow, e.g. the flow in (68) will converge to the one corresponding to the time-independent one, e.g.  = 0 in the flow of (68). For notational simplicity, let v = v denote the velocity field in (68) and v = v0 denote the velocity field when  = 0 in v = v.
26

Moreover, we denote L(и) = v и x(и) + D0x(и). Now, the vector corrector field  associated with the velocity field v satisfies the following cell problem,

( + L) = -v.

(A.1)

Let 0 denote the solution of the following equation

( + L)0 = -v0.

(A.2)

We aim to prove  converges to 0 as  approaches zero. At the same time we know the vector corrector field 0 associated with the velocity field v0 satisfies the following cell problem,

L00 = -v0,

(A.3)

where L0(и) = v0 и x(и) + D0x(и). Now we consider, 00(t, x) = 0(x), which solves,

( + L0)00 = -v0,

(A.4)

since  00 = 0. Comparing Eqns.(A.2) and (A.4) and using Prop.4.4, we know that 0 converges to 00 when  approaches zero. Finally, comparing Eqns.(A.1) and (A.2), we know  converges to 0 when  approaches zero. Therefore, we prove  converges to 0 when 
approaches zero.
