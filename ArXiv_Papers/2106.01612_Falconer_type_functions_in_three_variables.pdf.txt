Abstract
Let f  R[x, y, z] be a quadratic polynomial that depends on each variable and that does not have the form g(h(x) + k(y) + l(z)). Let A, B, C be compact sets in R. Suppose that dimH (A) + dimH (B) + dimH (C) > 2, then we prove that the image set f (A, B, C) is of positive Lebesgue measure. Our proof is based on a result given by Eswarathasan, Iosevich, and Taylor (Advances in Mathematics, 2011), and a combinatorial argument from the finite field model.

1 Introduction

Let Fq be an arbitrary finite field of order q, where q is a prime power. A function f : Flq  Fq is called a moderate expander with the exponent  if for all A  Fq with |A| > q1-, we have |f (A, A, . . . , A)|  q, where we write X  Y if X  CY for some constant C > 0 not depending on q.

Since 2005, there is a series of papers on seeking moderate expanders with the biggest exponents. When l = 2, a remarkable result of Tao in [29] says that any polynomial in

two variables which is not of the form g(h(x) + k(y)) or g(h(x)k(y)), for some polynomials

g, h, k, is a moderate expander

over

Fq

with the exponent

1 16

.

When l > 2, we

know

that

the following polynomials are expanders with the exponent

1 3

:

x + yz

[27],

x + (y - z)2

and x(y + z) [31], (x - y)2 + (z - t)2 [3], xy + zt [10], xy + z + t [26]. For more variables

polynomials, it is expectable to have bigger exponents. For instance, (x - y)(z - t) with



=

1 3

+

1 13542

in

[19],

xy + (z - t)2

with



=

+

[31],

also

be

found in [17, 30].

When f is the algebraic distance function, namely, f (x, y, z, t) = (x - y)2 + (z - t)2. A

result of Iosevich and Rudnev [12] on the Erdos-Falconer distance problem tells us that for

any

A



Fq ,

if

|A|



2q1-

1 4

,

then

f (A, A, A, A)

=

Fq .

The

exponent

1 4

has

been

improved

to

1 3

by

Chapman

et

al.

[3],

and

the

best

current

exponent

is

3 8

over

prime

fields

which

follows

from a recent result due to Murphy et al. [18].

In the setting of prime fields, a very general result on moderate expanders in three variables has been proved by the second listed author, Vinh, and De Zeeuw in [24]. More precisely, for any quadratic polynomial that depends on each variable and that does not have the form g(h(x) + k(y) + l(z)), and sets A, B, C  Fp with |A| = |B| = |C| = N, we have

|f (A, B, C)  min N 3/2, p .

So

any

such

a

quadratic

polynomial

is

a

moderate

expander

of

the

exponent

1 3

.

Corresponding to moderate expanders over finite fields, we have the following definition of Falconer type functions.

Definition 1.1. Let  : Rl  R, we say  is a Falconer type function with the threshold  if for any compact set A  R of Hausdorff dimension at least 1 - , then the image set (A, . . . , A) is of positive Lebesgue measure.

This definition is inspired by the famous Falconer distance conjecture, which says that for

any

compact

set

E



Rd,

if

the

Hausdorff

dimension

of

E

is

greater

than

d 2

,

then

the

Lebesgue measure of the distance set (E) is positive. The best current thresholds are

d 2

in

[5],

and

in

odd

dimensions by Du and Zhang in [4]. Several extensions of this problem have been studied

in the literature, for instance, see [8, 9, 14, 15] and references therein.

The main purpose of this paper is to provide a general family of Falconer type functions in three variables. Our proofs are based on a result given by Eswarathasan, Iosevich, and Taylor in [6], and a combinatorial argument from the finite field model. It will be seen through our approach that there is a close connection between the finite field model and the continuous setting. In the rest of this paper, we write dimH(X) for the Hausdorff dimension of X, and |X| for the Lebesgue measure of X.

Given f : Rd  R and t  R, define

Ttf (x) :=

f (y)(x, y)dx,t(y),

{(x,y)=t}

2

where dx,t is the Lebesgue measure on the set {y : (x, y) = t} and  is a smooth cut-off function. Let L2s(Rd) denotes the usual L2-Sobolev space of L2 functions with s generalized derivatives in L2(Rd).

In the first theorem, we clarify a class of three-variable Falconer type functions in terms of conditions on the generalized Radon transforms associated to a family of functions.

Theorem 1.2. Let A, B, C be compact sets in R. Let  : R3  R be a smooth function in three variables. Set (x, y, z, x, y, z) = (x, y, z) - (x, y, z). Suppose that

1. T0 : L2(Rd)  L2s(Rd), 2. dimH(A) + dimH(B) + dimH(C) > 3 - s, then |(A, B, C)| > 0.

In applications, the first condition can be checked partially by a celebrated result of Phong-

Stein [23] that if a smooth function  : U × V  Rd × Rd  R satisfies the so-called

Phong-Stein rotational curvature condition that

 det  0
y


x  = 0, 2 xiyj

on the set {(x, y) : (x, y) = t}, then the operator Tt is bounded from L2 to L2s with

s

=

d-1 2

.

Our approach in the proof of Theorem 1.2 can be used to obtain the same conclusion when  is a quadratic polynomial in three variables that depends on each variable and that does not have the form g(h(x) + k(y) + l(z)).

Theorem 1.3. Let f  R[x, y, z] be a quadratic polynomial that depends on each variable and that does not have the form g(h(x) + k(y) + l(z)). For compact sets A, B, C  R if dimH(A) + dimH(B) + dimH(C) > 2, then |f (A, B, C)| > 0.
Corollary 1.4. Let A, B, C be compact sets in R. Suppose that dimH (A) + dimH (B) + dimH(C) > 2, then we have
1. |(A - B)2 + C| > 0.

2. |A + BC| > 0.

3. |A(B + C)| > 0.

We note that case (3) in Corollary 1.4 was first proved by Liu in [20] through the Mattlia

3

integrals and using group actions. It is also not hard to see that the dimensional lower bound in Theorem 1.3 is in general sharp. For instance, we can take f (x, y, z) = xy + z. Let C be a set in [0, 1] that has Hausdorff dimension 1, but |C| = 0 (for example, take C to be like a Cantor set), and A = {0}, B = [0, 1]. Then, we have dimH(A) + dimH (B) + dimH(C) = 2. and f (A, B, C) = C. Hence, |f (A, B, C)| = 0.

Remark 1.1. The exclusion of the form of g(h(x)+k(y)+l(z)) is very natural and necessary

in the setting of finite fields. For instance, if we consider f (x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + z2, then we

can take A  Fp such that the set A2 = {a2; a  A} is an arithmetic progression. Thus the size of f (A, A, A) is still comparable with the size of A. However for continuous setting, we

are not aware of examples that have the same phenomena. In other words, are there three

sets A, B, C  R such that dimH(A) + dimH (B) + dimH(C) = 2 and |A2 + B2 + C2| = 0? From a known fact that Z + tZ has measure zero for almost every t where Z is the Cantor

set by removing the middle half in the construction of the set. Then we can easily take





A = Z, B = tZ and C = {0} so that A2 + B2 + C2 has measure zero. But it only gives

that dimH(A) + dimH(B) + dimH(C) = 1. It would be very interesting to construct A, B, C so that dimH(A)+dimH(B)+dimH(C) > 1 and |A2 +B2 +C2| = 0. Perhaps it is difficult to construct such examples, in particular in view of the results in the paper of Carlos Gustavo

T. de A. Moreira and Jean-Christophe Yoccoz in [28].

When l  4 is even, it follows from a result of Eswarathasan, Iosevich, and Taylor in [6,

Theorem

1.8]

that

for

any

compact

set

A



R

with

dimH (A)

>

l+2 2l

and

any

smooth

function

 satisfying the Phong-Stein curvature condition, we have |(A, . . . , A)| > 0. Due to the

generality of the function , this result in general does not offer the best threshold. For

example, let l = 4, and let (x, y, z, t) = (x - y)2 + z · t, then we would require the condition

dimH(A) > 3/4. However, if one follows our proof of Corollary 1.4 in the next section, then

it is not hard to see that we only need the condition dimH(A) > 5/8, which is directly in

line with Vinh's theorem in [31] over arbitrary finite fields. The same result also holds for

the function (x, y, z, t) = (x - y)2 + (z - t)2, which is a consequence of the recent result

on the Falconer distance problem in [7, 5]. A more general form of  in four variables can

also be derived from the recent work [11].

Let A be a compact set in R, it has been proved by Iosevich and Liu in [13] that if dimH(A) >

3 5

,

then

the

distance

set

of

E

=

A3

is of positive Lebesgue measure.

As an application of

Theorem 1.3, we have the following improvement.

Corollary

1.5.

Let

A

be

a

compact

set

in

R

and

E

= A × A × A  R3.

If

dimH(A) >

4 7

,

then we have |(E)| > 0.

4

We note that when E = Ad, if we wish the distance set has non-empty interior, then from the recent work [16], the following condition would be enough





d+1 2d

dimH(A) > 

d+1 2d

d-4 2d(3d-4)

d+1 2d

-

23d-228 114d(d-4)

if 2  d  4 if 5  d  26 if 27  d.

We also remark that, in the spirit of Theorem 1.3, it would be very interesting to study the Hausdorff dimension of the set f (A, B, C) for any quadratic polynomial that does not have the form g(h(x) + k(y) + l(z)). It is worth mentioning a result in this direction by Bourgain in [1, 2], which states that for any A, B  R with dimH(A) = dimH(B)  (0, 1), and C  R with dimH(C)  k > 0, then dimH(A + B)  , for some   C, where  > 0 depends only on dimH (A) and dimH(B). The recent progress on this problem can be found in [22] by Orponen. We hope to address this question in a subsequent paper.

2 Proof of Theorem 1.2
To prove Theorem 1.2, let us first recall the following result by Eswarathasan, Iosevich and Taylor [6]. Theorem 2.1 (Proposition 2.2 [6]). Let µ be a probability measure a compact set E  Rd and T0 maps L2 to L2s with d - s <  < d, where  = dim E. Then
µ × µ{(x, y)  E × E : |(x, y)|  } .

Remark 2.1. As mentioned in the paper [6] that the same result holds for E × F , i.e
µE × µF {(x, y)  E × F : |(x, y)|  } ,
if T0 maps L2 to L2s with d - s < ,  < d, where  = dim E and  = dim F . Remark 2.2. The authors of [6] also mentioned that it is also possible to consider the case E  Rd1 and F  Rd2 with d1, d2  2, and their result is most sufficient when d1 = d2 due to the current state of knowledge of Sobolev bounds for generalized Radon transforms, which makes their hypotheses reasonable.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Let  be a measure supported on the range of  defined by

f (t)(t) = f ((x, y, z))dµA(x)dµB(y)dµC(z),

where µX denotes a probability measure on X satisfying the Frostman condition. Our goal now is to show that the L2 norm of  is finite so that it immediately implies that the Lebesgue measure of the support of  is positive. We begin with an approximation of identity for  as follows. We choose   C0(R) with   0, supp()  B(0, 1), and
(x)dx = 1, and the associated approximate identity is (x) = -1(-1x) for  > 0.
Since     , it suffices to show that

(  )2(t)dt 1.

(1)

R

For  > 0, we define

D() = (x, y, z, x, y, z)  (A × B × C)2 : |(x, y, z) - (x, y, z)|   .

We now show that

(  )2(t)dt -1µA × µB × µC × µA × µB × µC(D(2)).
R
For the simplicity, we write µ6 for µA × µB × µC × µA × µB × µC.
For t  R, we have

  (t) =  ((x, y, z) - t) dµA(x)dµB(y)dµC(z)
R3

 dµA (x)dµB (y )dµC (z),

where S denotes the indicator function of a set S. Hence, applying the triangle inequality,

(  )2(t)dt
R
-2 {|t-(x,y,z)|}{|t-(x,y,z)|}dµ6(x, y, z, x, y, z)dt
 -2 {|t-(x,y,z)||}{|(x,y,z)-(x,y,z)|2}dµ6(x, y, z, x, y, z)dt
 -1µ6 (x, y, z, x, y, z)  (A × B × C)2 : |(x, y, z) - (x, y, z)|  2 .

6

Hence, the problem is reduced to prove that

µ6 ({(x, y, z, x, y, z)  A × B × C : |(x, y, z) - (x, y, z)|  2}) .

(2)

Under our assumptions, the estimate (2) follows from Theorem 1.5. This completes the proof.

3 Proof of Corollary 1.4
Corollary 1.4 follows from Theorem 1.3, but it also can be obtained directly from Theorem 1.2 with some additional calculations. Thus, we give a proof here, which also helps to understand the idea behind the proof of Theorem 1.3. Case 1: For the set (A - B)2 + C, we set

(x, y) := (x1 - y1)2 - (x2 - y2)2 + x3 - y3, x = (x1, y2, x3), y = (y1, x2, y3)

being a function from R3 × R3  R, and set E = A × B × C, F = B × A × C By a direct computation, we have

2x1 - 2y1 -2 0 0

-2x2 + 2y2 0 2 0

 100 = 4.
0

Hence, the Phong-Stein condition is satisfied and the proof is complete.

Case 2: For the set AB + C, we set

(x, y) := x1y1 + x3 - x2y2 - y3, x = (x1, y2, x3), y = (y1, x2, y3),

7

and set E = A × B × C, F = B × A × C. Then we can check that

 det  0
-(y )T



x

y1 1 0

-y2 0 -1

100 = 1.

0 00

Case 3: The proof of this case is quite different compared to the above. More precisely, let U = {(x, y, x · z) : x  A, y  B, z  C} and V = {(y, x, x · z) : y  B, x  A, z  C}. Define
(x, y) := x1y1 - x2y2 + y3 - x3.
In the next step, we are going to prove (2). We observe

(x, y, z, x, y, z)  (A × B × C)2 : |(x, y, z) - (x, y, z)|  2 = {(u, v)  U × V : |(u, v)|  2} .

To apply Theorem 1.5, we need to claim two conditions:

1. dimH(U ), dimH(V ) > 2, 2.  satisfies the Phong-Stein condition.

For the first condition, we can proceed as follows.

Without loss of generality, we assume that A is a compact subset of [0, 1] and have positive

distance from 0. To see this, we let A+ = A[0, 1] and A- = A[-1, 0]. It is clear that one of them must have the same dimension as A. If it is A-, then we will work with the polynomial

-x(y + z) instead of x(y + z), which does not affect the Monge-Ampere determinant for

our purpose. Thus, we can assume that A  [0, 1]. Note that from our assumption that

dimH A + dimH B + dimH C > 2, we have dimH A > 0. In other words, A can not be only supported on countable points. We now consider the restriction of µA into [0, 1/2] and [1/2, 1]. If µ([1/2, 1]) > 0, then we set A := [1/2, 1]. Otherwise, we continue to consider the

intervals

[0, 1/4]

and

[1/4, 1/2].

We

repeat

this

process

until

there

an

interval

[

1 2N

,

1 2N -1

]

with positive measure. This holds because otherwise µA(A) = limN µA

[0,

1 2N

]

= 0.

We now consider the map F :

F : R3  R3, (x, y, z)  (x, y, x · z).

It is not hard to check that under our assumptions on A, B, C, this map is bi-Lipschitz over

8

A × B × C. In other words, dimH (U) > 2. The same argument gives us dimH(V ) > 2. For the second condition, we have

4 Proof of Corollary 1.5

To prove Corollary 1.5, we first recall the following result from Liu in [21]. Lemma 4.1 ([21]). For E  R2 with dimH(E) > 1, then we have

dimH ((E))  min

dimH (E)

.

Proof of Corollary 1.5. Set A = B and C = (A2)2. It has been proved in [16, Lemma 2.3] that dimH(C) = dimH((A2)). Using Lemma 4.1 and Corollary 1.4 (3), we can conclude that |(A3)2| > 0 whenever dimH(A) > 4/7. This implies that |(A3)| > 0 under dimH(A) > 4/7.

5 Proof of Theorem 1.3
Some of our ideas to prove Theorem 1.3 are motivated by the results in [24] that are the discrete version of expanding polynomials in finite fields. While the key ingredient in the discrete version is the point-plane incidence bound which is unavailable to our continuous setting. Instead, we will still use the Phong-Stein curvature condition to construct an appropriate map . Moreover due to the complexity of our general assumption on the polynomials f , it may happen that the Phong-Stein curvature condition is not satisfied on some subsets. However after carefully analysing these bad subsets, we are able to show that these bad sets can be removed from our underlying sets so that the remaining good subsets still occupy a large portion that makes the proofs still go through. We now turn to the proofs.
Let f (x, y, z) be a quadratic polynomial that is not of the form g(h(x) + k(y) + l(z)). Then Theorem 1.3 is a combination of the following two lemmas.

9

Lemma 5.1. Let f (x, y, z) = axy + bxz + r(x) + s(y) + t(z) with r, s, t are polynomials in one variable of degree at most two. Suppose a = 0 and for compact sets A, B, C  R with dimH(A) + dimH(B) + dimH(C) > 2, we have |f (A, B, C)| > 0.

Proof. As in the proof of Corollary 1.4 (3), we assume that A, B, C  (0, ) and have positive distance from 0. The reason that we can assume all three sets A, B, C are all positive is because the properties of the corresponding map  that we will construct below are not affected if we change the coefficient +1 in front of the variables that have degree one in x, y or z to -1. This assumption will be useful in our proofs below.
Set U = {(x, y, bxz + r(x) + t(z) - s(y)) : (x, y, z)  A × B × C} ,

and V = {(ay, ax, bxz + r(x) + t(z) - s(y)) : (x, y, z)  A × B × C} ,

and define

(u, v) = u1v1 - u2v2 + u3 - v3.

As in the proof of Corollary 1.4 (3), we need to claim the following conditions:

1. dimH(U ), dimH(V ) > 2, 2.  satisfies the Phong-Stein condition.

The second condition is the same as we did in (3). To show dimH(U) > 2, we proceed as follows.

Let F : R3  R3 defined by

F (x, y, z) = (x, y, bxz + r(x) + t(z) - s(y)).

For each (x, y, u)  F (A, B, C), there exists only one z  A such that F (x, y, z) = (x, y, u). This is because the equation bxz + r(x) + t(z) - s(y) = u is of degree at most two. It is clear for the case of degree one. For the case of degree two, there are at most two solutions z satisfying that equation, but only one is positive because we assume A  (0, ) at the beginning.
Under our assumptions on A, B, C, the map F is bi-Lipchitz. Thus, dimH(U) > 2. The same holds for dimH(V ).
Lemma 5.2. Let f (x, y, z) = axy + bxz + cyz + r(x) + s(y) + t(z) with r, s, t polynomials
10

in one variable of degree at most two. Suppose a, b, c = 0 and f is not of the form g(h(x) + k(y) + l(z)). For compact sets A, B, C  R with dimH(A) + dimH(B) + dimH(C) > 2, then |f (A, B, C)| > 0.
Proof. As in the previous lemma, we can assume that A, B, C  (0, ), and have positive distance from 0.
We first write f as

f (x, y, z) = axy + bxz + cyz + dx2 + ey2 + gz2 + hx + iy + jz,

where a, b, c = 0 and d, e, g, h, i, j  R. Define

U = (x, ay + bz, dx2 - e(y)2 - cyz - g(z)2 + hx - iy - jz) : x  A, y  B, z  C ,

V = (ay + bz, x, d(x)2 - ey2 - cyz - gz2 + hx - iy - jz) : x  A, y  B, z  C ,
and (u, v) = u1v1 - u2v2 + u3 - v3.
As in the proof of Lemma 5.1, we have  satisfies the Phong-Stein condition. In the rest of the proof, we focus on showing that dimH(U), dimH(V ) > 2. We now adapt a combinatorial argument from [24, Lemma 2.3]. From our assumption, we know that f is not of the form g(h(x) + k(y) + l(z)), so at least one of the following equations does not hold

4de = a2, 4dg = b2, 4eg = c2, hc = ja = ib.

If not, one can write

f=

 dx

+

 ey

+

gz

+

h

-

h2 4d

if d, e, g are all squares in R. If all of d, e, g are not squares in R, the polynomial f can be

presented as

f

1 deg

degx + e

dgy + g dez + 2

2

-

h2 4d

,

since de, dg, eg are squares in R, and e, d, g = 0.

11

By permuting the variables if necessary, in the rest of the proof, we suppose that one of the following equations is not satisfied
ib = ja, 4eg = c2

To study the dimension of U, we consider the following map F : R3  R3 defined by

(x, y, z)  (x, ay + bz, dx2 - e(y)2 - cyz - g(z)2 + hx - iy - jz).

If F is a bi-Lipchitz map on A × B × C, then we are done. In the following, we show that F is bijective on the set (A × B × C) \ S where

S=

(x, y, z) :

x

A, y

 B, z



C,

ay + bz

=

-

ib2 - jab bc - 2ag

.

For (u, v, w)  F (A, B, C), we consider the following equations

u = x, v = ay + bz, w = dx2 - e(y)2 - cyz - g(z)2 + hx - iy - jz.

This implies

w = du2 - e(y)2 - cy

or

b2e - abc + a2g (y)2+ bcv - 2agv + ib2 - jab y+ b2w - b2du2 + gv2 - b2hu + bjv = 0.

We now fall in two following cases: Case 1: If either b2e - abc + a2g or bcv - 2agv + ib2 - jab is non-zero, then there is only one solution for y since B  (0, ). Case 2: If both b2e - abc + a2g and bcv - 2agv + ib2 - jab are zero, then we obtain

b2e - abc + a2g = 0, (bc - 2ag)v + (ib - ja)b = 0, b2w - b2du2 + gv2 - b2hu + bjv = 0. (4)

To understand this system, we do some more technical steps. If bc - 2ag = 0, then from the second equation that ib = ja. Hence, from the first equation

one has 4eg = c2. This leads to a contradiction to our assumptions. This means that we can assume that bc - 2ag = 0 from the beginning. In other words,
v = -(ib2 - jab)/(bc - 2ag).
On other words, we have shown that F is bijective on the set (A × B × C) \ S. Let U = F (A, B, C) \ F (S). It is clear that U   U. We now prove that dimH(U) > 2. Indeed, we know that dimH(S)  2 because the set S   × B where  is a line in xz plane. This means that dimH ((A × B × C) \ S) > 2. The claim follows from the fact that F is bi-Lipchitz on (A × B × C) \ S. The same argument will give us a set V   V such that dimH(V ) > 2. To conclude the proof of this theorem, we remark that |f (A, B, C)|  |f ((A × B × C) \ S)|. So, we can follow the proof of Theorem 1.2 for the set (A×B×C)\S instead of A×B×C.
