## Abstract

In this short communication, I gave a generalization of measurement postulate in quantum mechanics. It is regarding the case with partial measurement, namely, measurement on only part of a wave function. Upon a partial measurement, the wavefunction will either collapse in one of the eigenstate covered by the measured partial wavefunction; or collapses out of the measured part and shifts to the unmeasured part. An explanation in the WISE (Wavefunction Is System Entity) interpretation is given.
