## Abstract

We study a two-dimensional theory of gravity coupled to matter that is relevant to describe holographic properties of black holes with a single rotational parameter in five dimensions (with or without cosmological constant). We focus on the near-horizon geometry of the near-extremal black hole, where the effective theory reduces to Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity coupled to a massive scalar field. We compute the corrections to correlation functions due to cubic interactions present in this theory. A novel feature is that these corrections do not have a definite sign: for AdS$_5$ black holes the sign depends on the mass of the extremal solution. We discuss possible interpretations of these corrections from a gravitational and holographic perspective. We also quantify the imprint of the JT sector on the UV region, i.e. how these degrees of freedom, characteristic for the near-horizon region, influence the asymptotically far region of the black hole. This gives an interesting insight on how to interpret the IR modes in the context of their UV completion, which depends on the environment that contains the black hole.
