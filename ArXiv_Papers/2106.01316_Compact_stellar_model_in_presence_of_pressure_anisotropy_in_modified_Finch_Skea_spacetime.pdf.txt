Abstract A new model of anisotropic compact star is obtained in our present paper by assuming the pressure anisotropy. The proposed model is singularity free. The model is obtained by considering a physically reasonable choice for the metric potential grr which depends on a dimensionless parameter `n'. The effect of n is discussed numerically, analytically and through plotting. We have concentrated a wide range for n (10  n  1000) for drawing the profiles of different physical parameters. The maximum allowable mass for different values of n have been obtained by M-R plot. We have checked that the stability of the model is increased for larger value of n. For the viability of the model we have considered two compact stars PSR J1614-2230 and EXO 1785-248. We have shown that the expressions for the anisotropy factor and the metric component may serve as generating functions for uncharged stellar models in the context of the general theory of relativity.

an isolated body that is bounded by self-gravity, and which radiates energy supplied by an internal source. Most compact objects are formed to a point of the stellar evolution when the internal radiation pressure from the nuclear fusions of a star cannot balance the external gravitational force and the star collapses under its own weight. It is familiar that the model of compact star can be obtained by solving Einstein's field equations in the context of General theory of relativity. There are large numbers of papers on exact solution of Einstein's field equations for spherically symmetric perfect fluid spheres Delgaty & Lake (1998); Stephani em et al. (2003). Durgapal et al. (1982) have obtained two new classes of solutions of field equations with constant proper mass densities. Stewart (1982) has solved field equations for finding interior solutions for spherically symmetric, static and conformal flat anisotropic fluid spheres. According to Ruderman (1972) the pressure inside the highly compact astrophysical objects like an X-ray pulsar, Her-X-1, X-ray buster 4U 1820-30, the millisecond pulsar PSR J16142230, LMC X-4 etc. that have a core density beyond the nuclear density (1015 gm/cc) show anisotropic nature, i.e., the pressure inside these compact objects can be decomposed into two parts: the radial pressure pr and the transverse pressure pt. Existence of a solid stellar core, the presence of a type-3A superfluid, pion condensation, different kinds of phase transitions, mixture of two gases etc. are reasonable for pressure anisotropy Sawyer (1972); Sokolov (1980); Letelier (1980); Kippenhahn & Weigert (1990). A large number of works have been done by assuming pressure anisotropy Herrera & Santos (1997); Dev & Gleiser (2003); Sharma & Maharaj (2007); Rahaman et al. (2010, 2012); Bhar & Murad (2016).
To obtain the maximum value of the ratio of mass to radius for a model of compact star is an important problem in relativistic astrophysics since "the existence of

2
such a bound is intriguing because it occurs well before the appearance of an apparent horizon at M = R/2" as proposed by Guven & Murchadha (1999). The authors have investigated the upper limit of M/R for compact general relativistic configurations by assuming that inside the star the radial stress pr is different from the tangential pressure pt. It was also investigated by them that if the density is monotonically decreasing and radial pressure is greater than the tangential pressure then the upper bound 8/9 is still valid to the entire bulk if m is replaced by the quasi-local mass. Several bounds on the mass-radius ratio and anisotropy parameter have also been found, for models in which the anisotropic factor is proportional to r2 Mak et al. (2002). Bounds on m/r for static objects with a positive cosmological constant was obtained by Andr´easson & B¨ohmer (2009). According to Heintzmann & Hillebrandt (1975), for arbitrarily large anisotropy, in principle there is neither limiting mass nor limiting redshift and they also proposed that Semi-realistic equations of state lead to a mass of 3 - 4M for neutron stars with an anisotropic equation of state. Bowers & Liang (1974) have analytically obtained the maximum equilibrium mass and surface redshift in the case of incompressible neutron matter. For a relativistic stellar model the value of the redshift can not be arbitrarily large. Bondi (1992) considered the relation between redshift and the ratio of the trace of the pressure tensor to local density and proved that when anisotropic pressures are allowed, considerably larger redshift values can be obtained. Ivanov (2002) obtained the maximum value of the redshift for anisotropic stars. For realistic anisotropic star models, the surface redshift cannot exceed the values 3.842 or 5.211 when the tangential pressure respectively satisfies the strong or the dominant energy condition, whereas this bound in the perfect fluid case is 2.
The dynamical stability of spherically symmetric gravitational equilibria of cold stellar objects made of bosons and fermions was proposed by Jetzer (1990). Using the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equation, Jetzer et al. explored the dynamical instability of the static real scalar field Jetzer & Scialom (1992). Bhar et al. (2015c) studied the behavior of static spherically symmetric relativistic objects with locally anisotropic matter distribution considering the Tolman VII form for the gravitational potential grr in curvature coordinates together with the linear relation between the energy density and the radial pressure. Bhar (2015d) proposed a model of superdense star admitting conformal motion in presence of quintessence field by taking Vaidya & Tikekar (1982) ansatz motivated by accelerating phase of our present universe. Ivanov proposed a physically realistic stellar model with a simple expres-

sion for the energy density with conformally flat interior and discussed all the physical properties without graphic proofs Ivanov (2018). Recently, Sharma et al. (2020) obtained a new class of solutions by revisiting the Vaidya-Tikekar stellar model in the linear regime and discussed the impact of the curvature parameter K of the Vaidya-Tikekar model, which characterizes a departure from homogeneous spherical distribution, on the mass-radius relationship of the star. Mustafa et al. (2020) considered spherically symmetric space-time with an anisotropic fluid distribution. In particular, they used the Karmarkar condition to explore the compact star solutions. To study the model of compact star by utilizing Finch & Skea (1989) metric potential is a very interesting platform to the researchers. Hansraj & Maharaj (2006) obtained charged Finch-Skea stars and these models are given in terms of Bessel functions and obey a barotropic equation of state. Sharma & Ratanpal (2013) obtained the model of Stars with a quadratic equation of state with the Finch-Skea geometry and this work was extended by Pandya et al. for a generalized form of the gravitational potential Pandya et al. (2015). Kalam et al. (2014) proposed quintessence stars with both dark energy and anisotropic pressures. Charged anisotropy stellar model in the background of Finch and Skea geometry has been obtained by Maharaj et al. (2017) and the exact solutions have be expressed in terms of elementary functions, Bessel functions and modified Bessel functions. Bhar et al. (2015) proposed a new model of an anisotropic strange star which admits the Chaplygin equation of state. The study of compact star model in the context of Finch and Skea geometry has been studied in matter distributions with lower dimensions also Bhar et al. (2014); Banerjee et al. (2013). Relativistic solutions of anisotropic charged compact objects in hydrodynamical equilibrium with Finch-Skea geometry in the usual four and in higher dimensions has been studied by Dey & Paul (2020).
Inspired by all of these earlier works, in the present paper, we obtain a new model of singularity free compact star by assuming a physically reasonable anisotropic factor along with the metric potential grr. Our paper is arranged as follows: In sect. 2 the basic field equations have been discussed. In next sect., we have described about the metric potential grr. sect. 4 is devoted to the description of the new model. In sect. 5, we matched our interior solution to the exterior Schwarzschild line element. Physical analysis of the obtained model is described in sect. 6. In next section, the stability condition of the present model has been discussed and finally some comparative study of

3
the present model for different values of n is given in sect. 8

2 Interior Spacetime and Einstein field Equations

The structure of compact and massive stars is determined by Einstein's field equations,

Gµ

=



G c4

Tµ

,

(1)

Gµ , Tµ are Einstein tensor and energy-momentum tensor respectively. G and c respectively denote the universal gravitational constant and speed of the light.
A non-rotating spherically symmetry 4-D spacetime in Schwarzschild coordinates xµ = (t, r, , ) is described by the line element,

ds2 = -A2dt2 + B2dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2),

(2)

Where A and B are static, i.e., functions of the radial coordinate `r' only and these are called the gravitational potentials. They satisfy the Einstein's field equation (1). We also assume that, inside the stellar interior, the matter is anisotropic in nature and therefore, we write the corresponding energy-momentum tensor as,

Tµ = ( + pr)uµu - ptgµ + (pr - pt)vµv

(3)

with uiuj = -vivj = 1 and uivj = 0. Here the vector vi is the space-like vector and ui is the fluid 4-velocity and it is orthogonal to vi,  is the matter density, pt and pr are respectively the transverse and radial pressure of the fluid and these two pressure components act in the
perpendicular direction to each other.
The Einstein field equations assuming G = 1 = c are
given by

The eqn. (10) is called the Tolman-OppenheimerVolkoff (TOV) equation of a hydrostatic equilibrium for the anisotropic stellar configuration and  = 8 being the Einstein's constant.
Where `prime' indicates differentiation with respect to radial co-ordinate r. Our goal is to solve the eqns. (4)-(6).

3 Choice of the metric potential

In the system (4)-(6), we have three equations with

five unknown (, pr, pt, A, B). To solve this sys-

tem we are free to choose any two of them. Now

by our previous knowledge of algebra we know that

there are

5 2

= 10 possible ways to chose any two

unknowns. Sharma & Ratanpal (2013), Bhar et al.

(2016a), Bhar & Ratanpal (2016) choose B2 along

with pr, Bhar & Rahaman (2015) choose  along with
pr, Murad & Fatema (2015), Thirukkanesh et al. (2018) choose A2 with  to model different compact

stars. But a very popular technique is to choose B2

along with an equation of state (EoS), i.e., a rela-

tion between the matter density  and radial pressure

pr. Several papers were published in this direction Sharma & Maharaj (2007); Komathiraj & Maharaj

(2007); Sunzu et al. (2014); Bhar (2015); Bhar et al.

(2017, 2016b); Bhar & Murad (2016); Thomas & Pandya

(2017).

To solve the equation (4)-(6) let us assume the expres-

sion of the co-efficient of grr, i.e., B2 as,

B2 =

1

+

r2 R2

n
,

(11)

where n = 0 is a real number. If one takes n = 0, then from eqn. (4), we get  = 0, which is not physically reasonable. The gravitational potential B2 is well behaved and finite at the origin. It is also continuous in the interior and it is important to realize that this choice for B2 is physically reasonable. For n = 1, the metric potential reduces to well known Finch & Skea (1989) potential. The metric potential in (11) was used earlier by Pandya et al. (2015) to model a compact star by using a proper choice of the radial pressure pr and they proved that the model is compatible with observational data. Assuming G = c = 1 and by using (11) into (4), the

4

expression for matter density is obtained as,

To solve the equations (13) and (14), we choose, the

Using the expression of B2, eqns. (5) and (6) becomes,

(14).

From equation (13) and (14), it is clear that once we

have the expression for A, one can obtain the expres-

sions for pr, pt in closed form. Instead for a choice for

A, for our present model we introduce the anisotropic

factor , the difference between these two pressures,

i.e., pt - pr. This anisotropic factor measures the

anisotropy inside the stellar interior and it creates an

anisotropic

force

which

is

defined

as

2 r

.

This force

may be positive or negative by depending on the sign

of , but at the center of the star, the force is zero

since the anisotropic factor vanishes there.

Whenever we choose the expression one has to remember that the expression of  is to be chosen in such a manner that (i) it should vanish at the center of the star, (ii) it does not suffer from any kind of singularities , (iii)  is positive inside the stellar interior and finally (iv) the field equation can be integrated easily with this choice of . To obtain the model of compact star, Dey & Paul (2020), Maharaj et al. (2014), Murad & Fatema (2015) choose a physically reasonable choice of  to find the exact solutions for the Einstein-Maxwell equations. Our present choice of the anisotropic factor satisfies the above conditions which will be verified in the coming section and therefore this choice is physically reasonable.

So, we have matched our interior spacetime to the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime at the boundary r = rb. Obviously it is clear that the metric coefficients are continuous at r = rb, but the transverse pressure pt does not vanish at the boundary and therefore it is not continuous at the junction surface. To take care of this situation, let us use the Darmois-Israel (1966, 1967) formation to determine the surface stresses at the junction boundary. The intrinsic surface stress energy tensor Sij is given by Lancozs equations in the following form

6 Physical analysis of the present model
1. Regularity of the metric functions at the center: We observe from eqns. (11) and (18) that the

8
metric potentials take the following values at the center of the star:

B2|r=0 = 1,

(36)

A2|r=0 =

D(2 + n) + CR2+n 2+n

2
,

(37)

The above two equations imply that metric functions are free from singularity and positive at the center. 2. Behavior of pressure and density: From eqns. (12), (19) and (20) the central density and central pressure are obtained as,

c

(39)

From eqn. (38), we get, n > 0. Therefore we can conclude that the dimensionless parameter n can never be negative. So n  R+, R being the set of real numbers. Now eqn. (39) holds if,

6.1 The compact star PSR J1614-2230 and EXO 1785-248
To obtain the values of the constants R, C and D in the expressions of different model parameters, we have considered two compact stars PSR J1614-2230 and EXO 1785-248. The observed and estimated masses and radii of these two stars have been given in table 1 and table 2 respectively. Using the expressions for R, C and D from eqns. (27)-(29), the numerical values of these parameters have been determined for different values of n and presented in table 1 and table 2. By using the mentioned values in table 1 for the compact star star PSR J1614-2230, we generated the plots of matter density (), radial pressure (pr), transverse pressure (pt), anisotropic factor () in Figs. 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The matter density  is positive, finite and monotonically decreasing function of `r', i.e., the maximum values of these physical model parameters are attained at the center of the star. The radial and

again verifies that , pr, pt are monotonic decreasing.

The equation of state parameters r and t are plotted

in Fig. 5. From the profiles, we see that r is monotonic

decreasing and t is monotonic increasing function of r also 0 < r, t < 1, indicate that the underlying mat-

ter distribution is non-exotic in nature. The ratio of

is

and has been shown graphically in Fig. 5.

One interesting thing we can note that, for larger val-

ues

of

`n',

for

the

model

parameters

t

and

pr

+2pt 

,

the

central values of these two physical quantities increase

and at r = 7.3 km., irrespective of `n', all the curves

coincide. Moreover for 0 < r < 7.3, as `n' increases, the

profile corresponding to small value of `n' is dominated

by the profile corresponding to the value of `n' larger

than previous one. On the other hand for 7.3 < r < rb,

the nature of the curves for these two physical quanti-

ties become the reverse of the former.

6.2 Energy Conditions

To be a physically reasonable model, one of the most important properties that should be satisfy by our model is that the energy conditions viz, null energy condition (NEC), weak energy condition (WEC), strong energy condition (SEC) and dominant energy condition (DEC). These energy conditions are obeyed if the following inequalities hold simultaneously:

N EC : : Tµµ  0 or  + pi  0,

(44)

W EC : : Tµµ  0 or   0,  + pi  0, (45)

DEC : : Tµµ  0 or   |pi|,

(46)

SEC :

:

Tµ µ

or

i

(47)

Where i takes the value r and t for radial and transverse pressure. µ and µ are time-like vector and null vector respectively and T µµ is non space-like vector. To check all the inequality stated above, we have drawn the profiles of left hand sides of (44)-(47) in Fig. 6 in the interior of the compact star PSR J1614-2230 for different values of `n'. The figures show that all the energy conditions are satisfied by our model of compact star.

One can easily check that limr0 m(r) = 0, which in-

dicates that the mass function is regular at the center

of the star. What is more,

1

1

r2 R2

< 1 and hence m(r) > 0. As `n' increases,

decreases and therefore mass function in-

creases. So, m(r) is a monotonic increasing function

of r. The twice maximum allowable ratio of mass to

the radius are obtained as, 0.5997 and 0.4693 for the

compact stars PSR J1614-2230 and EXO 1785-248 re-

spectively,

and

these

values

lie in the range

6.4 Equation of state

To construct a model of a compact star, it is a very common choice among the researchers to use any specific equation of state (EOS) which gives a relationship between the pressure and density. We still do not know the relationship between the matter density and the pressures. To check the variation of pressure with density, we have plotted pr versus  and pt versus  in Fig. 7, from which one can predict possible EoS. For the complexity in the expressions of , pr and pt, it is very difficult to obtain a well known relation between them. With the help of the numerical analysis, we have obtained the best fitted curve which gives us a prediction about the relationship between the matter density and pressure. We have drawn the profiles for the compact star PSR J1614-2230 by taking different values of the dimensionless constant `n' mentioned in the figures.

6.5 Mass-radius curves

The mass-radius relation for different values of the di-

mensionless parameter `n' for the compact star PSR

J1614-2230 is shown in Fig. 8. In the following table

we have given the maximum allowable mass for different

values of `n' and we have also obtained the correspond-

ing radius from the figure.

7 Stability Analysis

7.1 Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov stability criterion

A stability condition for the model of compact star pro-

posed by Harrison et al. (1965) and Zeldovich & Novikov

(1971) depending on the mass and central density of

the star. They suggested that for stable configuration

M c

> 0,

otherwise

the

system

will

be

unstable.

Where

M, c denotes the mass and central density of the com-

pact star.

For our present model,

M c

=

4 3

rb3

1

+

 3n

crb2

-n-1
.

(51)

Above expression of

M c

is positive and hence the

sta-

bility condition is well satisfied. The variation of the

mass function and

M c

with respect to the central den-

sity are depicted in Fig. 9.

7.2 Stability under three forces

The stability of our present model under three different forces viz gravitational force, hydrostatics force and anisotropic force can be described by the equation,

-

MG( + r2

known as TOV equation. where MG(r) represents the gravitational mass within the radius r, which can be derived from the TolmanWhittaker formula and the Einstein's field equations and is defined by

MG(r)

=

r2

A B

.

(53)

Plugging the value of MG(r) in equation (52), this equation can be rewritten as,

7.3 Causality condition and method of cracking

For a physically acceptable model the radial and
transverse velocity of sound should lie in the range Vr2, Vt2  [0, 1], known as causality condition. Where radial (Vr2) and transverse velocity (Vt2) of sound is defined as,

Vr2

=

pr 

,

Vt2

=

pt 

.

(58)

The expressions for , pr, pt have been given in eqns. (41)-(43). Now, due to the complexity of the expres-
sion it is very difficult to verify the causality condition analytically. The profiles of Vr2 and Vt2 are shown in Fig. 11. It is clear from the figure that both Vr2 and Vt2 lie in the reasonable range. So it can be concluded
that the causality condition is well satisfied. Next
we want to concentrate to the stability factor of the present model which is defined as Vt2 - Vr2. For the stability of a compact star model, Herrera (1992) pro-
posed the method of `cracking' and using this method,
Abreu et al. (2007) proposed that for a potentially stable configuration, Vt2 - Vr2 < 0. From Fig. 11 (bottom panel), we see that the stability factor is negative and
hence we conclude that our model is potentially stable
everywhere within the stellar interior.

7.4 Adiabatic index

For a particular stellar configuration, Bondi (1964) examined that a Newtonian isotropic sphere will be in equilibrium if the adiabatic index  > 4/3 and it gets modified for a relativistic anisotropic fluid sphere. Based on these results, the stability of a anisotropic stellar configuration depends on the adiabatic index r is given by,

Fig. 12 r is plotted against r inside the stellar interior for the compact star PSR J1614-2230 for different values of `n' mentioned in the figure.

For our present model, the profile of r are shown in Fig. 12 for different values of `n'. From the figure, we see that the profile of radial adiabatic index are monotonic increasing function of r and r > 4/3 every where within the stellar configuration and hence the condition of stability is satisfied.

8 Discussion
Present paper provides a new generalized model of compact star by assuming a physically reasonable

metric potential together with a pressure anisotropy. We matched our interior solution to the exterior Schwarzschild line element at the boundary to fix the values of the different constants. From the boundary conditions we have obtained the values of R, C, D for the compact star PSR J1614-2230 and EXO 1785-248 with masses 1.97 M, 1.3 M respectively and radii 9.69 km, 8.85 km respectively in table 1 and table 2 for different values of the dimensionless parameter `n'. From the tables, it is clear that the numerical values of the constants C and D decreases with increasing `n' where as the numerical values of R increases with `n' increasing. One notable thing is that the numerical values of C decreases rapidly whereas the numerical value of D decreases steadily. All the profiles are depicted for the compact star PSR J1614-2230. We have plotted the profiles of matter density (), radial pressure (pr) and transverse pressure (pt) for different values of `n' and we see that all are positive and monotonic decreasing function of r. The values of the model parameters like central density, surface density, central pressure, surface transverse pressure, central value of radial adiabatic index for the above mentioned two stars are presented in table 3 and table 4. We also note that the cental values of pressure and density decreases with increasing `n', it is evident from table II as well as from Fig. 1, Fig. 2. On the other hand, the surface density of the star increases as `n' increases. Plugging G and c in the expression of  and pr, we obtained the central density and central pressure for different values of `n' which lies in the range 1.57 × 1015 gm/cm3 - 1.64 × 1015 gm/cm3 and 2.05 × 1035 dyne/cm2 - 2.26 × 1035 dyne/cm2 respectively. It can also be noted that, the surface density lies in the range 7.43 × 1014 gm/cm3 - 7.62 × 1014 gm/cm3 for the compact star PSR J1614-2230. Also, the central density and central pressure for different values of `n' lies in the range 1.36 × 1015 gm/cm3 - 1.32 × 1015 gm/cm3 and 8.802 × 1034 dyne/cm2 - 1.005 × 1035 dyne/cm2 respectively and surface density lies in the range 6.96 × 1014 gm/cm3 - 7.14 × 1014 gm/cm3 for the compact star EXO 1785-248. From the figure, it is clear that the transverse pressure pt always dominates the radial pressure pr and it creates a positive pressure anisotropy and hence repulsive force towards the boundary. With the help of graphical representation, we have shown that our model satisfies all the energy conditions and (pr + 2pt)/ is monotonic decreasing and less than 1. The radial adiabatic index r > 4/3 and the causality conditions are satisfied by our model. The stability conditions of the model have been tasted by different conditions. The equation of state parameter r is monotonic decreasing function of `r' but t is monotonic increasing. Both of them and lies in the

16
range 0 < r, t < 1 (Fig. 5). The forces acting on the present model is depicted in Fig. 10 and it shows the effect of gravitational force (Fg) and anisotropic force (Fa) are increased with the increasing value of `n'. The central values of radial adiabatic index for the compact star PSR J1614-2230 and EXO 1785-248 are obtained in table. 3 and table. 4. We see that the cental values of radial adiabatic index increases as `n' increases. So one can conclude that the increasing value of `n' makes the system more stable in respect of the test of adiabatic index. One can also note that the central values of radial and transverse velocity of sound increase with the increasing values of `n'. To check the behavior of the radial and transverse pressure with the matter density we draw the profiles of pr versus  and pt versus  in Fig. 4. The potential stability condition of the present model is also satisfied. So we can conclude that solution obtained in this paper can be used as a successful model for the description of ultra-compact stars.
