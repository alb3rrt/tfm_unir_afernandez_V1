Abstract.The paper deals with a comprehensive theory of mappings, whose local behavior can be described by means of linear subspaces, contained in the graphs of two (primal and dual) generalized derivatives. This class of mappings includes the graphically Lipschitzian mappings and thus a number of multifunctions, frequently arising in optimization and equilibrium problems. The developed theory makes use of own generalized derivatives, provides us with some calculus rules and reveals a number of interesting connections. In particular, it enables us to construct a modification of the semismooth* Newton method with improved convergence properties and to derive a generalization of Clarke's Inverse Function Theorem to multifunctions together with new efficient characterizations of strong metric (sub)regularity and tilt stability.

1 Introduction
When implementing the semismooth Newton method [14] for solving an inclusion of the form
0  F(x)
with some set-valued mapping F : Rn  Rn, we observed that it is advantageous to work with linear subspaces L  Rn × Rn having dimension n and are contained in the graph of the limiting coderivative, i.e.,
L  gph DF(x, y)
at points (x, y)  gph F. However, this paper goes far beyond the analysis of the above issue and presents a comprehensive
study of a class of mappings, whose local behavior can be described by appropriately constructed linear subspaces. This class turns out to be rather broad and the developed theory helps us both to suggest an efficient modification of the semismooth Newton method as well as to derive a number of new results concerning strong metric subregularity, strong metric regularity and tilt stability. More precisely, for the mentioned mapping F, primal and dual generalized derivatives are introduced, whose elements are subspaces of dimension n. In order to define these derivatives, we consider points in the graph of the mapping where the tangent cone amounts to a subspace and then perform an outer limiting operation in a certain compact metric space.
Our construction is motivated by the definition of the B-subdifferential (Bouligand-subdifferential) for single-valued mappings, whose elements are given as limit of Jacobians at points where the mapping is Fre´chet differentiable. Note that the tangent cone to the graph of a map is a subspace whenever

the mapping is differentiable at the point under consideration. Instead of computing limits of matrices, we consider the limit of subspaces given by the graph of the linear mappings induced by the matrices. When the mapping is Lipschitzian, then we obtain a one-to-one correspondence between the new primal generalized derivative and the B-subdifferential. However, for non-Lipschitzian single-valued mappings there will be a difference because we are considering limits of subspaces in a compact metric space whereas the underlying matrices can be unbounded.
There are some relations between our generalized derivatives and existing ones. The dual derivative consists of subspaces contained in the limiting coderivative and the elements of the primal derivative are subspaces contained in the so-called outer limiting graphical derivative. To the best of our knowledge, the latter has not yet been considered in the literature and is contained in the so-called strict graphical derivative.
Our theory is not applicable to arbitrary mappings F. However, as already mentioned, the class of mappings which are suited for our approach, is rather broad and important for applications. In particular, every mapping which is graphically Lipschitzian, i.e., its graph coincides under some change of coordinates with the graph of a locally Lipschitzian mapping, belongs to this class. Graphically Lipschitzian mappings have been already considered by Rockafellar [32]. E.g., locally maximally hypomonotone mappings like the subdifferential mapping of prox-regular and subdifferentially continuous functions possess this property [26]. Thus, our approach is particularly suitable for second-order theory. Note that in [32] also a limit of tangent spaces has been considered. However, in [32] an inner limit with respect to the usual set-convergence has been used yielding a different sort of results.
Within the framework of the new theory one can introduce a new regularity notion leading to an adaptation of the semismooth Newton method. This notion is weaker than metric regularity and enables us to streamline the algorithm and to relax the assumptions, ensuring its locally superlinear convergence. Under the respective regularity condition it is also possible to show that a semismooth mapping is strongly metrically subregular, not only at the reference point itself but also on a neighborhood of it. It seems that this somewhat extended property of strong metric subregularity around the reference point has not been considered yet. As a byproduct, we present a characterization of this property by means of the outer limiting graphical derivative.
Finally we turn our attention to the property of strong metric regularity. Since strongly regular mappings are graphically Lipschitzian by the definition, the preceding theory enables us to reveal some interesting new connections. In particular, one obtains a generalization of Clarke's Inverse Function Theorem to set-valued mappings and, when applied to specific problem classes, these results lead to new characterizations of strong metric regularity for locally maximally monotone operators and to a new characterization of tilt-stability. Compared with existing characterizations, the new ones have the advantage, that not the whole strict graphical derivative or limiting coderivative must be checked (as, e.g., in [8, 27]) but only a condition on the subspaces contained in its graph. In this way the arsenal of available criteria for strong metric regularity (cf. [30, 9, 15, 8, 10]) and tilt stability (cf. [27, 11, 23]) is enriched.
The plan of the paper is as follows. After the Preliminaries, devoted to relevant notions from variational analysis, in Section 3 we introduce and analyze the crucial class of SCD (subspace containing derivative) mappings. In their analysis we make use of the mentioned generalized derivatives, for which some basic calculus rules are developed and exact formulas in case of graphically Lipschitzian mappings are provided. Section 4 deals with the adaptation of the semismooth Newton method to SCD mappings. The convergence analysis leads in this context to the notion of SCD regularity, whose relationship with the strong metric subregularity around a point is established in Section 5. Finally, in Section 6 we present a generalization of Clarke's Inverse Function Theorem and new characterizations of strong metric regularity and tilt stability for various classes of SCD mappings.

The following notation is employed. Given a linear subspace L  Rn, L denotes its orthogonal complement and, for a closed cone K with vertex at the origin, K signifies its (negative) polar. Further, given a multifunction F, gph F := {(x, y) | y  F(x)} stands for its graph. For an element u  Rn, u
denotes its Euclidean norm and B (u) denotes the closed ball around u with radius  . In a product space we use the norm (u, v) := u 2 + v 2. Given an m × n matrix A, we employ the operator
norm A with respect to the Euclidean norm and we denote the range of A by rge A. Given a set   Rs, we define the distance of a point x to  by d(x) := dist(x, ) := inf{ y - x | y  } and the indicator function is denoted by . When a mapping F : Rn  Rm is differentiable at x, we denote by F(x) its Jacobian.

2 Preliminaries

Throughout the whole paper, we will frequently use the following basic notions of modern variational analysis. All the sets under consideration are supposed to be locally closed around the points in question without further mentioning.

Definition 2.1. Let A be a set in Rs and let x¯  A. Then

(i) The tangent (contingent, Bouligand) cone to A at x¯ is given by

TA

(x¯)

:=

Lim sup
t0

A

- t

x¯

and the paratingent cone to A at x¯ is given by

TAP(x¯)

:=

Lim sup
x A x¯

A

- t

x

t0

(ii) The set

NA(x¯) := (TA(x¯))

is the regular (Fre´chet) normal cone to A at x¯, and

NA(x¯) := Lim sup NA(x)
A
xx¯
is the limiting (Mordukhovich) normal cone to A at x¯. Given a direction d  Rs,
NA(x¯; d) := Lim sup NA(x¯ + td)
t0
d  d
is the directional limiting normal cone to A at x¯ in direction d.
In this definition "Lim sup" stands for the Painleve´-Kuratowski outer (upper) set limit, see, e.g.,[1]. If A is convex, then NA(x¯) = NA(x¯) amounts to the classical normal cone in the sense of convex analysis and we will write NA(x¯). By the definition, the limiting normal cone coincides with the directional limiting normal cone in direction 0, i.e., NA(x¯) = NA(x¯; 0), and NA(x¯; d) = 0/ whenever d  TA(x¯).
The above listed cones enable us to describe the local behavior of set-valued maps via various generalized derivatives. All the set-valued mappings under consideration are supposed to have locally closed graph around the points in question.

Definition 2.2. Consider a multifunction F : Rn  Rm and let (x¯, y¯)  gph F.
(i) The multifunction DF(x¯, y¯) : Rn  Rm given by gph DF(x¯, y¯) = TgphF (x¯, y¯) is called the graphical derivative of F at (x¯, y¯).
(ii) The multifunction DF(x¯, y¯) : Rn  Rm given by gph DF(x¯, y¯) = TgPphF (x¯, y¯) is called the strict (paratingent) derivative of F at (x¯, y¯).
(iii) The multifunction DF(x¯, y¯) : Rm  Rn defined by
gph DF(x¯, y¯) = {(y, x) | (x, -y)  NgphF (x¯, y¯)}

is called the regular (Fre´chet) coderivative of F at (x¯, y¯). (iv) The multifunction DF(x¯, y¯) : Rm  Rn, defined by
gph DF(x¯, y¯) = {(y, x) | (x, -y)  NgphF (x¯, y¯)}

is called the limiting (Mordukhovich) coderivative of F at (x¯, y¯). (v) Given a pair of directions (u, v)  Rn × Rm, the multifunction DF((x¯, y¯); (u, v)) : Rm  Rn,
defined by
gph DF((x¯, y¯); (u, v)) = {(y, x) | (x, -y)  NgphF ((x¯, y¯); (u, v))}

is called the directional limiting coderivative of F at (x¯, y¯) in direction (u, v).

The directional limiting normal cone and coderivative were introduced by the first author in [12]
and various properties of these objects can be found also in [13] and in the references therein. Note that DF(x¯, y¯) = DF((x¯, y¯); (0, 0)) and that dom DF((x¯, y¯); (u, v)) = 0/ whenever v  DF(x¯, y¯)(u).
Note that by [33, Proposition 6.6] and the definition of the limiting coderivative we have

gph DF(x¯, y¯) = Lim sup gph DF(x, y).
(x,y) g-ph F(x¯,y¯)

(2.1)

If F is single-valued, we can omit the second argument and write DF(x), DF(x), . . . instead of DF(x, F(x)), DF(x, F(x)), . . .. However, be aware that when considering limiting objects at x where F is not continuous, it is not enough to consider only sequences xk  x but we must work with sequences (xk, F(xk))  (x, F (x)).
Definition 2.3. Let U  Rn be open and let F : U  Rm be a mapping. The B-subdifferential of F at x  U is defined as

F (x)

:= {A |

xk

x:F

is

Fre´chet

differentiable

at

xk

and

A

=

lim
k

F

(xk

)}

(2.2)

Recall that the Clarke Generalized Jacobian is given by conv F(x), i.e., the convex hull of the B-subdifferential.
There exists the following relation between the B-subdifferential and the coderivative of F, which states that every element from the B-subdifferential defines a certain subspace contained in the graph of the coderivative.

4

Proposition 2.4. Let U  Rn be open and let F : U  Rm be a mapping. Let F be continuous at x  U
and let A  F(x). Then (y, AT y)  gph DF(x) y  Rm.

Proof. Consider A  F(x) together with some sequence xk  x such that F(xk)  A as k  . By [33, Example 9.25(b)] we have TgphF (xk, F(xk)) = {(u, F(xk)u) | u  Rn} and therefore (y, F(xk)T y)  gph DF(xk), y  Rm. By passing to the limit, the assertion follows from the
definition of the limiting coderivative.

If the mapping F : U  Rm is Lipschitz continuous, by Rademacher's Theorem F is differentiable almost everywhere in U and F(x) is bounded there by the Lipschitz constant of F. Thus F(x¯) =
0/ for Lipschitz continuous mappings F. Let q : Rn  R¯ be an extended-real-valued function with the domain and the epigraph

dom q := {x  Rn | q(x) < }, epi q := {(x, )  Rn × R |   q(x)}.

The (limiting/Mordukhovich) subdifferential of q at x¯  dom q is defined geometrically by  q(x¯) := {x  Rn | (x, -1)  Nepiq(x¯, q(x¯))}.

This subdifferential is a general extension of the classical gradient for smooth functions and of the classical subdifferential of convex ones.
Let us now recall the following regularity notions.
Definition 2.5. Let F : Rn  Rm be a mapping and let (x¯, y¯)  gph F.

1. F is said to be metrically subregular at (x¯, y¯) if there exists   0 along with some neighborhood

X of x¯ such that

dist(x, F-1(y¯))   dist(y¯, F(x)) x  X .

(2.3)

The infimum over all   0 such that (2.3) holds for some neighborhood X is denoted by subreg F(x¯, y¯).

2. F is said to be strongly metrically subregular at (x¯, y¯) if it is metrically subregular at (x¯, y¯) and there exists a neighborhood X  of x¯ such that F-1(y¯)  X  = {x¯}.

3. F is said to be metrically regular around (x¯, y¯) if there is   0 together with neighborhoods X of x¯ and Y of y¯ such that

dist(x, F-1(y))   dist(y, F(x)) (x, y)  X ×Y.

(2.4)

The infimum over all   0 such that (2.4) holds for some neighborhoods X ,Y is denoted by reg F(x¯, y¯).

4. F is said to be strongly metrically regular around (x¯, y¯) if it is metrically regular around (x¯, y¯) and F-1 has a single-valued localization around (y¯, y¯), i.e., there are open neighborhoods Y  of y¯, X  of x¯ and a mapping h : Y   Rn with h(y¯) = x¯ such that gph F  (X  ×Y ) = {(h(y), y) | y  Y }.

It is well-known, see, e.g. [10], that the property of (strong) metric subregularity for F at (x¯, y¯) is equivalent with the property of (isolated) calmness for F-1 at (y¯, x¯). Further, F is metrically regular around (x¯, y¯) if the inverse mapping F-1 has the so-called Aubin property around (y¯, x¯). In this paper
we will frequently use the following characterization of strong metric regularity.

5

Theorem 2.6 ( cf. [10, Proposition 3G.1]). F : Rn  Rm is strongly metrically regular around (x¯, y¯) if and only if F-1 has a Lipschitz continuous localization h around (y¯, x¯). In this case there holds

h(y) - h(y)

reg F(x¯, y¯) = lim sup
y,y y¯

y - y

.

y=y

In this paper we will also use the following point-based characterizations of the above regularity properties.

Theorem 2.7. Let F : Rn  Rm be a mapping and let (x¯, y¯)  gph F.

(i) (Levy-Rockafellar criterion) F is strongly metrically subregular at (x¯, y¯) if and only if

0  DF(x¯, y¯)(u)  u = 0.

(2.5)

and in this case one has

subreg F(x¯, y¯) = sup{ u | v : (u, v)  gph DF(x¯, y¯), v  1}.

(ii) (Mordukhovich criterion) F is metrically regular around (x¯, y¯) if and only if

0  DF(x¯, y¯)(y)  y = 0.

(2.6)

Further, in this case one has

reg F(x¯, y¯) = sup{ y | x : (y, x)  gph DF(x¯, y¯), x  1}.

(2.7)

(iii) F is strongly metrically regular around (x¯, y¯) if and only if

0  DF(x¯, y¯)(u)  u = 0

(2.8)

and (2.6) holds. In this case one also has

reg F(x¯, y¯) = sup{ u | v : (u, v)  gph DF(x¯, y¯), v  1}.

(2.9)

Proof. Statement (i) follows from [10, Theorem 4E.1]. Statement (ii) can be found in [21, Theorem 3.3]. The criterion for strong metric regularity follows from Dontchev and Frankowska [8, Theorem 16.2] by taking into account that the condition x¯  lim infyy¯ F-1(y) appearing in [8, Theorem 16.2] can be ensured by the requirement that F is metrically regular which in turn can be characterized by the Mordukhovich criterion.
For a sufficient condition for metric subregularity based on directional limiting coderivatives we refer to [13].
The properties of (strong) metric regularity and strong metric subregularity are stable under Lipschitzian and calm perturbations, respectively, cf. [10]. Further note that the property of (strong) metric regularity hold around all points belonging to the graph of F sufficiently close to the reference point, whereas the property of (strong) metric subregularity is guaranteed to hold only at the reference point. This leads to the following definition.

6

Definition 2.8. We say that the mapping F : Rn  Rm is (strongly) metrically subregular around (x¯, y¯)  gph F if there is a neighborhood W of (x¯, y¯) such that F is (strongly) metrically subregular at every point (x, y)  gph F W and we define

l-subreg F(x¯, y¯) := lim sup subreg F(x, y) < .
(x,y) g-phF(x¯,y¯)
In this case we will also speak about (strong) metric subregularity on a neighborhood.

Note that every polyhedral multifunction, i.e., a mapping whose graph is the union of finitely many convex polyhedral sets, is metrically subregular around every point of its graph by Robinson's result [31]. In Section 5, characterizations of strong metric subregularity on a neighborhood will be investigated.
Next we introduce the semismooth sets and mappings.

Definition 2.9. (cf. [14].) 1. A set A  Rs is called semismooth at a point x¯  A if for all u  Rs it holds x, u = 0 x  NA(x¯; u).

(2.10)

2. A set-valued mapping F : Rn  Rm is called semismooth at a point (x¯, y¯)  gph F, if gph F is semismooth at (x¯, y¯), i.e., for all (u, v)  Rn × Rm we have

u, u = v, v (v, u)  gph DF((x¯, y¯); (u, v)).

(2.11)

The class of semismooth* mappings is rather broad. We list here two important classes of multifunctions having this property.
Proposition 2.10. (i) Every mapping whose graph is the union of finitely many closed convex sets is semismooth at every point of its graph.
(ii) Every mapping with closed subanalytic graph is semismooth at every point of its graph.
Proof. The first assertion was already shown in [14, Proposition 3.4, 3.5]. As mentioned in [14, Remark 3.10], the semismooth property of sets amounts to the notion of semismoothness introduced in [16]. It follows thus from [19, Theorem 2], that all closed subanalytic sets are automatically semismooth and the second statement holds by the definition of semismooth mappings.
The statement of Proposition 2.10(ii) can be considered as the counterpart to [4], where it is shown that locally Lipschitz tame mappings F : U  Rn  Rm are semismooth in the sense of Qi and Sun [29]. In case of single-valued Lipschitzian mappings the semismooth property is equivalent with the semismooth property introduced by Gowda [15], which is weaker than the one in [29].
In the above definition the semismooth sets and mappings have been defined via directional limiting normal cones and coderivatives. For our purpose it is convenient to make use of equivalent characterizations in terms of standard (regular and limiting) normal cones and coderivatives, respectively.
Proposition 2.11 (cf.[14, Corollary 3.3]). Let F : Rn  Rm and (x¯, y¯)  gph F be given. Then the following three statements are equivalent

7

(i) F is semismooth at (x¯, y¯).
(ii) For every  > 0 there is some  > 0 such that | x, x - x¯ - y, y - y¯ |   (x, y) - (x¯, y¯) (x, y) (x, y)  B (x¯, y¯) (y, x)  gph DF(x, y).
(2.12)
(iii) For every  > 0 there is some  > 0 such that | x, x - x¯ - y, y - y¯ |   (x, y) - (x¯, y¯) (x, y) (x, y)  B (x¯, y¯) (y, x)  gph DF(x, y).
(2.13)

3 SCD mappings

In what follows we denote by Zn the metric space of all n-dimensional subspaces of R2n equipped with the metric
dZ (L1, L2) := P1 - P2
where Pi is the symmetric 2n × 2n matrix representing the orthogonal projection on Li, i = 1, 2. Sometimes we will also work with bases for the subspaces L  Zn. Let Mn denote the collection
of all 2n × n matrices with full rank n and for L  Zn we define
M (L) := {Z  Mn | rge Z = L},
i.e., the columns of Z  M (L) are a basis for L. Further we denote by M orth(L) the set of all matrices Z  M (L) with ZT Z = I, i.e., the columns of Z are an orthogonal basis for L. Recall that, given any matrix Z¯  M (L) ( or Z¯  M orth(L)) there holds
M (L) = {Z¯B | B nonsingular n × n matrix} (M orth(L) = {Z¯B | B orthogonal n × n matrix}).

Further recall that the 2n × 2n matrix P, representing the orthogonal projection on some L  Zn, admits the representations

P = Z(ZT Z)-1ZT , Z  M (L) and P = ZZT , Z  M orth(L).

(3.14)

Lemma 3.1. (i) Let Zk  Mn be a sequence converging to some Z  Mn. Then rge Zk converges in Zn to rge Z  Zn.

(ii) Let Lk  Zn be a sequence converging to L  Zn. Then there is a sequence Zk  M (Lk) converging to some Z  M (L).

(iii) Let Ak be a sequence of nonsingular 2n × 2n matrices converging to a nonsingular matrix A and let Lk  Zn be a sequence converging to L  Zn. Then limk dZ (AkLk, AL) = 0.

(iv) The metric space Zn is compact.
Proof. The first statement follows immediately from Z(ZT Z)-1ZT = limk Zk(ZkT Zk)-1ZkT together with (3.14). In order to prove (ii), choose Zk  M orth(Lk) and Z  M orth(L). Then ZZT = limk ZkZkT due to Lk -Zn L and consequently Z = ZZT Z = limk Z~k with Z~k := Zk(ZkT Z). Hence, for sufficiently large k we have Z~k  Mn and Z~k  M (Lk) follows. This proves (ii) and (iii) follows from (ii) and (i). In order to prove the compactness of Zn, consider a sequence Lk  Zn together with basis matrices Zk  M orth(Lk). By possibly passing to a subsequence we may assume that Zk converges to some Z. Since ZT Z = limk ZkT Zk = I, we conclude Z  Mn and rge Z = limk Lk  Zn by (i). Hence the metric space Zn is (sequentially) compact.

8

We treat every element of R2n as a column vector. In order to keep our notation simple we write

(u, v) instead of

u v

 R2n when this does not lead to confusion. In order to refer to the components

of the vector z =

u v

we set 1(z) := u, 2(z) = v.

Let L  Zn and consider Z  M (L), which can be written in the form Z =

A B

. But we will

rather write it as Z = (A, B); thus rge (A, B) := {(Au, Bu) | u  Rn} =.

Au Bu

| u  Rn = L.

Similarly as before, we will also use 1(Z) := A, 2(Z) = B for referring to the two n × n parts of Z.

Further, for every L  Zn we define

L := {(-v, u) | (u, v)  L},

(3.15)

where L denotes as usual the orthogonal complement of L. Note that (L) = {(v, u) | v, -v + u, u = 0 (u, v)  L} = {(v, u) | (u, -v)  (L)}

and therefore

(L) = {(u, v) | (v, -u)  (L)} = {(u, v) | (-u, -v)  L} = L.

We denote by Sn the 2n × 2n orthogonal matrix

Sn :=

0 I

-I 0

,

so that L = SnL. If P represents the orthogonal projection on L then I -P is the orthogonal projection on L and Sn(I - P)SnT is the orthogonal projection on L. Given 2 subspaces L1, L2  Zn with orthogonal projections P1, P2, we obtain
dZ (L1, L2) = Sn(I - P1)SnT - Sn(I - P2)SnT = Sn(I - P1 - (I - P2))SnT = P1 - P2 = dZ (L1, L2).
Thus the mapping L  L defines an isometry on Zn and a sequence (Lk) converges in Zn to some L if and only if the sequence (Lk) converges to L.
Consider the following relation between the graphical derivative and differentiability in case of single-valued mappings.
Lemma 3.2. Consider f : U  Rn with U  Rn open and a point x  U .
(i) If f is Fre´chet differentiable at x, then DF(x) is a single-valued linear mapping, DF(x)(u) =  f (x)u, u  Rn, and consequently Tgph f (x, f (x)) = rge (I,  f (x))  Zn.
(ii) Conversely, if Tgph f (x, f (x))  Zn and f is calm at x, i.e., there is some   0 such that the estimate f (x) - f (x)   x - x holds for all x sufficiently close to x, then f is Fre´chet differentiable at x.
Proof. The statement (i) follows immediately from [33, Exercise 9.25]. In order to show (ii), we first prove that there is an n × n matrix A such that Tgph f (x, f (x)) = rge (I, A). Considering any Z  M (Tgph f (x, f (x))), we will show that B := 1(Z) is nonsingular. Assuming on the contrary that B

9

is singular, there is some p = 0 with Bp = 0. Then v := 2(Z)p = 0 because otherwise Z p = 0 which is not possible. Hence (0, v) = Z p  Tgph f and there exists sequences tk  0 and (uk, vk)  (u, v) such that f (x) + tkvk = f (x + tkuk) k implying tk vk = f (x + tkuk) - f (x)  tk uk and v = limk uk = 0, a contradiction. Hence B is nonsingular and we obtain Tgph f (x, f (x)) = rge (B, 2(Z)) = rge (I, 2(Z)B-1) proving our claim with A = 2(Z)B-1. Hence D f (x)u = Au, u  Rn
and the assertion follows once more from [33, Exercise 9.25].

Note that, when f : U  Rn, U  Rn open, is Fre´chet differentiable at u  U , then we even have

Tgph

f

(u,

f

(u))

.

We now introduce new generalized derivatives for set-valued mappings. To the majority of appli-

cations we confine ourselves with the particular case F : Rn  Rn.

Definition 3.3. Consider a mapping F : Rn  Rn.

1. We say that F is graphically smooth of dimension n at (x, y)  gph F, if TgphF (x, y) = gph DF(x, y)  Zn. Further we denote by OF the set of all points where F is graphically smooth of dimension n.

2. Associate with F the four mappings S F, S F, S F, S F, all of which map gph F  Zn and are given by

S F(x, y) := {gph DF(x, y)} if (x, y)  OF ,

0/

else,

S F(x, y) := {gph DF(x, y)} if (x, y)  OF ,

3. (a) We say that F has the SCD (subspace containing derivative) property at (x, y)  gph F, if S F(x, y) = 0/ .
(b) We say that F has the SCD property around (x, y)  gph F, if there is a neighborhood W of (x, y) such that F has the SCD property at every (x, y)  gph F W .
(c) Finally, we call F an SCD mapping if F has the SCD property at every point of its graph.
Remark 3.4. By definition of the regular coderivative there holds
gph DF(x, y) = gph DF(x, y), (x, y)  OF .
Remark 3.5. Since L  L is an isometry on Zn and (L) = L, we have
S F(x, y) = {L | L  S F(x, y)}, S F(x, y) = {L | L  S F(x, y)}.

Hence, F has the SCD property at (x, y)  gph F if and only if S F(x, y) = 0/ .

10

Since we consider convergence in the compact metric space Zn, we obtain readily the following result.
Lemma 3.6. The mapping F : Rn  Rn has the SCD property at (x, y) if and only if (x, y)  cl OF . Further, F is an SCD mapping if and only if cl OF = cl gph F, i.e., F is graphically smooth of dimension n at the points of a dense subset of its graph.

The name "SCD property" is motivated by the following statement.

Lemma 3.7. Let F : Rn  Rn and let (x, y)  gph F. Then for every subspace L  S F(x, y) we have L  gph DF(x, y).

Proof. Let L  S F(x, y) and consider a sequence (xk, yk, Lk)  (x, y, L) with (xk, yk)  OF and
Lk := (gph DF(xk, yk))  S F(xk, yk). By Remark 3.4 we have Lk = gph DF(xk, yk). Consider Zk  M orth(Lk). By possibly passing to a subsequence the matrices Zk converge to some Z and L = rge Z by Lemma 3.2. Taking into account Zk p  Lk = gph DF(xk, yk), we obtain Z p = limk Zk p  gph DF(x, y) p  Rn by the Definitions 2.1, 2.2 showing that L  gph DF(x, y).

We will now show that the primal subspaces L  S F(x, y) also belong to the graph of some suitable generalized derivative mapping. Consider the following definition.

Definition 3.8. 1. Let A  Rn and let x¯  A. The outer limiting tangent cone to A at x¯ is defined as

TA(x¯) := Lim sup TA(x) = Lim sup

x A x¯

x A x¯

(3.16)

2. Consider a multifunction F : Rn  Rm and let (x¯, y¯)  gph F. The outer limiting graphical derivative of F at (x¯, y¯) is the multifunction DF(x¯, y¯) : Rn  Rm given by
gph DF(x¯, y¯) = TgphF (x¯, y¯).
Remark 3.9. Comparing (3.16) with the definition of the paratingent cone TAP(x¯) it follows that TA(x¯)  TAP(x¯) and therefore DF(x¯, y¯)(u)  DF(x¯, y¯)(u), u  Rn.
Using similar arguments as in the proof of Lemma 3.7 one obtains the following result.
Lemma 3.10. Let F : Rn  Rn and let (x, y)  gph F. Then for every subspace L  S F(x, y) we have L  gph DF(x, y).

For single-valued mappings the constructions of Definition 3.3 are related to the B-subdifferential.
Lemma 3.11. Let U  Rn be open and let f : U  Rn be continuous. Then for every x  U there holds

S f (x) := S (x, f (x))  {rge (I, A) | A   f (x)}, S  f (x) := S (x, f (x))  {rge (I, AT ) | A   f (x)}.

(3.17) (3.18)

If f is Lipschitz continuous near x, these inclusions hold with equality and f has the SCD property around x.

11

Proof. Consider x  U and A   f (x) together with sequences xk  x and  f (xk)  A. Then for each k we have Tgph f (xk, f (xk)) = rge (I,  f (xk)) =: Lk  Zn by Lemma 3.2 implying that (xk, f (xk))  O f
and S f (xk) = {Lk}. Thus the subspaces Lk converge in Zn to rge (I, A)  S f (x) by Lemma 3.1(i). This proves (3.17). By taking into account the identity rge (I, A) = rge (-AT , I), it follows that rge (I, A) = rge (I, AT ) verifying (3.18). Now assume that f is Lipschitzian near x and consider L  S f (x) together with a sequence (xk, f (xk)) -Of (x, f (x)) such that Lk := Tgph f (xk, f (xk)) -Zn L. By Lemma 3.2 we conclude that f is differentiable at xk and Lk = rge (I,  f (xk)). By Lipschitz continuity of f the derivatives  f (xk) are bounded. Hence, by possibly passing to a subsequence, we can assume that  f (xk) converges to some A   f (x) and Lk -Zn rge (I, A) follows. This proves equality in (3.17) and equality in (3.18) easily follows from the identity rge (I, A) = rge (I, AT ). Since ¯ f (x) = 0/ for Lipschitz continuous mappings, the SCD property at x is established. This also holds
for every point sufficiently close to x and thus f has the SCD property even around x.

Remark 3.12. In particular, every Lipschitz continuous mapping f : U  Rn with U  Rn open is an SCD mapping. However, the converse is not true: Consider the function f (x) = |x| which is an SCD mapping but not Lipschitz continuous.

Lemma 3.13. Consider a mapping F : Rn  Rn and let (x, y)  gph F. Then

S F(x, y) = Lim sup S F(u, v), S F(x, y) = Lim sup S F(u, v).

(u,v) g-ph F(x,y)

(u,v) g-phF(x,y)

Proof.

We prove only the first equation.

follows easily from the definition of S F(x, y) together with S F(u, v)  S F(u, v), (u, v)  gph F. In

order to show the reverse inclusion, consider L  S together with sequences (uk, vk) g-phF(x, y) and Lk 

S F(uk, vk) with Lk -Zn L. By definition, for every k we can find (uk, yk)  OF and Lk  S F(uk, vk))

such that

Thus

and

verifying

L  S F(x, y).

We now provide some calculus rules.

Proposition 3.14. Given a mapping G : Rn  Rn and a mapping  : R2n  R2n, consider the mapping F : Rn  Rn given by
gph F = {(x, y) | (x, y)  gph G}.
Then for every (x, y)  gph F such that  is continuously differentiable in some neighborhood of (x, y) and (x, y) is nonsingular, there holds

S F(x, y) = (x, y)-1S G((x, y))(:= {(x, y)-1L | L  S G((x, y))}), S F(x, y) = Sn(x, y)T SnT S G((x, y)).

(3.19) (3.20)

Proof. By the classical Inverse Function Theorem, there is some open neighborhood W of (x, y) such that  is a one-to-one mapping from W to the open neighborhood W~ := (W ) of (x, y) and (x, y) is nonsingular for every (x, y)  W . By [33, Exercise 6.7] we have TgphF (x, y) = (x, y)-1TgphG((x, y)) for all (x, y)  gph F W and it follows that OG W~ = (OF W ). Con-
sider L  S F(x, y) together with sequences (xk, yk) -OF (x, y) and Lk  S F(xk, yk) converging to L.
Then for all k sufficiently large we have TgphG((xk, yk)) = (xk, yk)TgphF (xk, yk) = (xk, yk)Lk 

12

S G((xk, yk) showing (x, y)L = limk (xk, yk)Lk  S G((x, y)) by Lemma 3.1(iii). This proves that S F(x, y)  (x, y)-1S G((x, y)).
To show the reverse inclusion, consider L  S G((x, y)) together with sequences zk O-GW~ (x, y) and Lk  S G(zk) with Lk  L. It follows that the sequence (xk, yk) := -1(zk)  W converges to (x, y) and TgphF (xk, yk) = (xk, yk)-1Lk  S F(xk, yk) implying (x, y)-1L  S F(x, y) by Lemma 3.2(iii). Hence (x, y)-1S G((x, y))  S F(x, y) and equation (3.19) follows. To prove the equation (3.20), just use Remark 3.5 together with the fact that for any L  Zn we have ((x, y)-1L) = (x, y)T L implying
((x, y)-1L) = Sn(x, y)T L = Sn(x, y)T SnT L.

Proposition 3.15. Let F : Rn  Rn have the SCD property at (x, y)  gph F and let h : U  Rn be continuously differentiable at x  U where U  Rn is open. Then F + h has the SCD property at
(x, y + h(x)) and

S (F + h)(x, y + h(x)) =

I h(x)

0 I

L | L  S F(x, y)

S (F + h)(x, y + h(x)) =

I h(x)T

0 I

L | L  S F(x, y)

(3.21) (3.22)

Proof. We have gph (F + h) = {(u, v + h(u)) | (u, v)  gph F} = {(x, y) | (x, y - h(x))  gph F} and the assertion follows from Proposition 3.14 with (x, y) = (x, y - h(x)).

Next, let us proceed to the large class of graphically Lipschitzian mappings.
Definition 3.16 (cf.[33, Definition 9.66]). A mapping F : Rn  Rm is graphically Lipschitzian of dimension d at (x¯, y¯)  gph F if there is an open neighborhood W of (x¯, y¯) and a one-to-one mapping  from W onto an open subset of Rn+m with  and -1 continuously differentiable, such that (gph F  W ) is the graph of a Lipschitz continuous mapping f : U  Rn+m-d, where U is an open set in Rd.
Proposition 3.17. Assume that F : Rn  Rn is graphically Lipschitzian of dimension n at (x¯, y¯)  gph F. Then F has the SCD property around (x¯, y¯) and for every (x, y)  gph F, sufficiently close to (x¯, y¯), one has

S F(x, y) = (x, y)-1S f (u) = rge (x, y)-1 I B

| B  ¯ f (u) ,

(3.23a)

S F(x, y) = Sn(x, y)T SnT S  f (u) = rge Sn(x, y)T SnT

I BT

| B  ¯ f (u) , (3.23b)

where  and f are as in Definition 3.16 and u := 1((x, y)).

Proof. Follows from Proposition 3.14 together with Lemma 3.11.

Remark 3.18. Note that for a graphically Lipschitizian mapping F we have (OF  W ) = O f by the proof of Proposition 3.14, where W ,  and f are as in Definition 3.16. At points (u, f (u)) 

O f the mapping f is Fre´chet differentiable at u by Lemma 3.2(ii) and therefore Tgph f (u, f (u)) =

Corollary 3.19. Let F : Rn  Rn and let (x¯, y¯)  gph F be given. Suppose that there is an open neighborhood V of x¯ and a continuously differentiable mapping h : V  Rn such that F + h is strongly metrically regular around (x¯, y¯ + h(x¯)). Then F is graphically Lipschitzian of dimension n with transformation mapping (x, y) = (y + h(x), x). Therefore F has the SCD property around (x¯, y¯) and for every (x, y)  gph F sufficiently close to (x¯, y¯) one has

S F(x, y) = {rge (B, I - h(x)B) | B  ¯ (F + h)-1(y + h(x))}

(3.24a) (3.24b)

Proof. By Theorem 2.6 there are open neighborhoods U of y¯+h(x¯), W  of (y¯+h(x¯), x¯) and a Lipschitz continuous mapping f : U  Rn such that gph f = gph (F + h)-1 W . Since gph (F + h)-1 = {(y + h(x), x) | (x, y)  gph F, x  V }, F is graphically Lipschitzian of dimension n and (3.24) follows from
Proposition 3.17 by taking into account that

Some examples for graphically Lipschitzian mappings F : Rn  Rn of dimension n were already given in [32, 26]. Next, we extend these examples and give an explicit description of the subspaces contained in S F(x, y) and S F(x, y), respectively. Recall that a mapping F : Rn  Rn is said to be monotone if
y1 - y2, x1 - x2  0 for all (xi, yi)  gph F, i = 1, 2.
It is maximally monotone if, in addition, there holds gph F = gph T for every monotone mapping T : Rn  Rn with gph F  gph T . Next we define several types of local monotonicity.
Definition 3.20. Let F : Rn  Rn and let (x, y)  gph F. We say the following:

1. F is locally monotone at (x, y) if there is an open neighborhood X ×Y of (x, y) such that

y1 - y2, x1 - x2  0 for all (xi, yi)  gph F  (X ×Y ), i = 1, 2.

(3.25)

It is locally maximally monotone if, in addition, there holds gph F  (X ×Y ) = gph T  (X ×Y ) for every monotone mapping T : Rn  Rn with gph F  (X ×Y )  gph T .

2. F is locally (maximally) hypomonotone at (x, y) if I + F is locally (maximally) monotone at (x, x + y) for some   0.

Related with maximally monotone operators are the so-called firmly nonexpansive mappings.
Definition 3.21. 1. A mapping f : Rn  Rn is called firmly nonexpansive if f (u1) - f (u2), u1 - u2  f (u1) - f (u2) 2, u1, u2  Rn.
2. An n × n matrix B is called firmly nonexpansive, if the linear mapping u  Bu is firmly nonexpansive, i.e., Bv, v  Bv 2, v  Rn.

14

Note that an n × n matrix B is firmly nonexpansive if and only if 2B - I  1, see, e.g., [3, Fact 1.1]. Further, a firmly nonexpansive matrix B is positive semidefinite and satisfies B  1 and, when B is symmetric, these conditions are also sufficient for B being firmly nonexpansive.

Proposition 3.22. Let F : Rn  Rn be locally maximally monotone at (x¯, y¯). Then F is graphically Lipschtzian of dimension n at (x¯, y¯) with transformation mapping (x, y) = (x+ y, x) and consequently F has the SCD property around (x¯, y¯). Further, for every (x, y)  gph F sufficiently close to (x¯, y¯) and for every subspace L  S F(x, y) there is a firmly nonexpansive n × n matrix B such that L = rge (B, I - B) and L = rge (BT , I - BT ).

Proof. Let Floc : Rn  Rn be given by gph Floc = gph F  (X × Y ), where (X × Y ) is as in Definition 3.20. Then Floc is monotone, has a maximally monotone extension F~ , cf. [33, Proposition 12.6] and gph F  (X × Y ) = gph F~  (X × Y ). By [2, Corollary 23.8], rge (I + F~ ) = Rn and the resolvent f := (I + F~ )-1 is a single-valued, firmly nonexpansive mapping on Rn. Since f (x¯ + y¯) = x¯, we
can find an open neighborhood U of x¯ + y¯ such that f (u)  X and u - f (u)  Y for all u  U . It follows that (I + F)-1(u) = (I + F~ )-1(u) and therefore I + F is strongly metrically regular around
(x¯, x¯ + y¯). Thus F is graphically Lipschitzian at (x¯, y¯) and has the SCD property around (x¯, y¯) by
Corollary 3.19. Now consider a subspace L  S F(x, y), where (x, y) is close to (x¯, y¯). By (3.24a) there is a matrix B  ¯ f (x + y) such that L = rge (B, I - B). Since f is firmly nonexpansive, for every (u, f (u))  O f we have  f (u)v, v   f (u)v 2 and Bv 2  Bv, v , v  Rn follows. This
completes the proof.

If F is only locally maximally hypomonotone at (x¯, y¯), it follows that (1 + )I + F is strongly metrically regular around (x¯, (1 + )x¯ + y¯) for some   0. Hence we obtain the following corollary.

Corollary 3.23. Let F : Rn  Rn be locally maximally hypomonotone at (x¯, y¯). Then there is some   0 such that F is graphically Lipschitzian at (x¯, y¯) of dimension n with transformation mapping (x, y) = ((1+ )x+ y, x) and therefore F has the SCD property around (x¯, y¯). For every (x, y)  gph F
sufficiently close to (x¯, y¯) and every subspace L  S F(x, y) there is a firmly nonexpansive n× n matrix B such that L = rge (B, I - (1 + )B) and L = rge (BT , I - (1 + )BT ).

Corollary 3.24. A mapping F : Rn  Rn which is locally maximally hypomonotone on a dense subset of its graph is an SCD mapping.

We now consider the subdifferential mapping  q of some lsc function q : Rn  R¯ .

Definition 3.25. 1. A function q : Rn  R¯ is prox-regular at x¯  dom q for x¯   q(x¯) if q is locally lsc around x¯ and there exist  > 0 and   0 such that for all x, x  B(x¯) with |q(x)- q(x¯)|  
one has

q(x)  q(x) + x, x - x -  x - x 2 2

whenever

x   q(x)  B (x¯).

When this holds for all x¯   q(x¯), q is said to be prox-regular at x¯.

2. A function q : Rn  R¯ is called subdifferentially continuous at x¯  dom q for x¯   q(x¯) if for any sequence (xk, xk) g-phq(x¯, x¯) we have limk q(xk) = q(x¯). When this holds for all x¯   q(x¯), q is said to be subdifferentially continuous at x¯.

Proposition 3.26. Suppose that q : Rn  R¯ is prox-regular and subdifferentially continuous at x¯ for x¯   q(x¯). Then  q is locally maximally hypomonotone at (x¯, x¯) and there is some  > 0 such that  q

15

is graphically Lipschitzian at (x¯, y¯) with transformation mapping (x, x) = (x +  x, x). Thus  q has

the SCD property around (x¯, x¯). Further, for every (x, x)  gph  q sufficiently close to (x¯, x¯) one has

S  q(x, x) = S  q(x, x) and for every L  S  q(x, x) there is a symmetric positive semidefinite

n

B

such

that

(B,

Proof. Let q~(x) := q(x) - x¯, x . Then  q~(·) =  q(·) - x¯ and q~ is prox-regular at x¯ for 0. By the definition of prox-regularity we have

q~(x)  q~(x¯) -  2

x - x¯ 2 x  B (x¯)

for some  > 0 and some   0. Hence the function q^ := q~ + B fulfills the baseline assumption of [26, Section 4]. By [26, Proposition 4.8] the subdifferential mapping  q^ is locally maximally
hypomonotone around (x¯, 0) and, by the proof of [26, Theorem 4.7], there is some  > 0 such  q^ is graphically Lipschitzian with transformation mapping (x, x) = (x +  x, x). Moreover, by [26, Theorem 4.4], (I +   q^)-1 is locally monotone at (x¯, x¯) and there holds

for all u sufficiently close to x¯, where

(3.26)

e

q^(y)

:=

inf{

x - y 2 + q^(x)},

denotes the Moreau envelope of q^. Consider a pair (x, x^) close to (x¯, 0) and a subspace L  S  q^(x, x^).

According to Corollary 3.23, there is a matrix B  (I +  q^)-1(x+ x^) with L = (x, x^)-1rge (I, B) =

Since (I +   q^)-1 is locally monotone at (x¯, x¯), it follows that B is positive semidefinite. Further, by

(3.26)

we

have

(e q^)(x +  x^).

By

[33,

Theorem

13.52],

(e q^)(x +  x^)

consequently

B

Since

L

(

we

obtain

L = L and S  q^(x, x^) = S  q^(x, x^) follows. Now, by taking into account that  q~ and  q^ coincide

near x¯ and  q differs from  q~ only by the constant x¯, it follows that all the shown properties do not

hold only for  q^ but also for  q.

Corollary 3.27. For every lsc function q : Rn  R¯ which is prox-regular and subdifferentially continuous at x for x on a dense subset of gph  q, its subdifferential mapping  q is an SCD mapping.

Clearly, every lsc convex function is prox-regular and subdifferentially continuous at all points of its domain. Further, the proof of Proposition 3.26 holds true with  = 1 and (I +  q)-1 is firmly nonexpansive and therefore B  1 B  (I +  q^)-1(x¯). Thus we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 3.28. For every lsc proper convex function q : Rn  R¯ the subdifferential mapping  q is graphically Lipschitzian of dimension n at every point (x, x) of its graph. Hence  q is an SCD mapping and for every (x, x)  gph  q and every L  S  q(x, x) = S  q(x, x) there is a symmetric positive semidefinite n × n matrix B with B  1 such that L = rge (B, I - B).

16

Example 3.29. Let C  Rn be a convex polyhedral set and consider q = C so that  q = NC. By the well-known reduction Lemma, see, e.g., [10, Lemma 2E.4], we have TgphNC (x, x) = gph NKC(x,x), where KC(x, x) := TC(x)  [x] denotes the critical cone to C at x for x. Thus NC is graphically smooth of dimension n at (x, x) if and only if KC(x, x) is a subspace and in this case we have
S NC(x, x) = KC(x, x) × KC(x, x) = S NC(x, x). Given (x¯, x¯)  gph NC, by [10, Lemma 4H.2], for every sufficiently small neighborhood W of (x¯, x¯), the collection of all critical cones KC(x, x), (x, x)  W coincides with the collection of all sets of the form F1 - F2, where F1, F2 are faces of KC(x¯, x¯) with F2  F1. Since F1 - F2 is a subspace if and only if F1 = F2 and KC(x¯, x¯) has
only finitely many faces, we obtain

S NC(x¯, x¯) = S NC(x¯, x¯) = {(F - F ) × (F - F ) | F is face of KC(x¯, x¯)}.

(3.27)

Of course, for every face F of KC(x¯, x¯) we have

(F - F ) × (F - F ) = rge (B, I - B),

where B represents the orthogonal projection on F - F .
Let us compare the representation (3.27) with the limiting coderivative DNC(x¯, x¯). It was shown in [9, Proof of Theorem 2] that NgphNC (x¯, x¯) is the union of all product sets K × K associated with cones K of the form F1 - F2, where F1 and F2 are closed faces of the critical cone KC(x¯, x¯) satisfying F2  F1. Thus, gph DNC(x¯, x¯) is the union of all respective sets of the form (F2 - F1) × (F1 - F2) and we see that S NC(x¯, x¯) has a less wicked structure than the limiting coderivative DNC(x¯, x¯) whenever the critical cone KC(x¯, x¯) is not a subspace.

4 On semismooth* Newton methods for SCD mappings

Consider the inclusion

0  F(x),

(4.28)

where F : Rn  Rn. Assume that x¯ is a reference solution of (4.28). The idea behind the semismooth Newton method [14] for solving (4.28) is as follows. If F is semismooth at (x¯, 0) and we are given some point (x, y)  gph F close to (x¯, 0), then for every (y, x)  gph DF(x, y) there holds

x, x - x¯ = y, y - 0 + o( (x, y) - (x¯, 0) (x, y) )

by the definition of the semismoothness* property. We choose now n pairs (yi , xi )  gph DF(x, y), i = 1, . . . , n, compute a solution x of the system

xi , x = - yi , y , i = 1, . . . , n

and expect that (x + x) - x¯ = o( (x, y) - (x¯, 0) . When dealing with SCD mappings F we can simplify this procedure by choosing the pairs (yi , xi ) as a basis of some subspace L  S F(x, y),
which allows us to weaken the notion of semismoothness* along the lines of Proposition 2.11.

Definition 4.1. We say that F : Rn  Rn is SCD semismooth at (x¯, y¯)  gph F if F has the SCD property around (x¯, y¯) and for every  > 0 there is some  > 0 such that

| x, x - x¯ - y, y - y¯ |   (x, y) - (x¯, y¯) (x, y)

(4.30)

holds for all (x, y)  gph F  B (x¯, y¯) and all (y, x) belonging to any L  S F(x, y). We say that F : Rn  Rn is SCD semismooth around (x¯, y¯)  gph F if there is some neighborhood W of (x¯, y¯) such that F is SCD semismooth at every (x, y)  gph F W .

17

The chosen subspace L  S F(x, y) should have the property that the resulting system (4.29) has a unique solution. This yields the following definition.

Definition 4.2. We denote by Znreg the collection of all subspaces L  Zn such that

(y, 0)  L  y = 0.

(4.31)

Proposition 4.3. Given a 2n×n matrix Z, there holds rge Z  Znreg if and only if the n×n matrix 2(Z) is nonsingular. Thus, for every L  Znreg there is a unique n × n matrix CL such that L = rge (CL, I). Further, L = rge (CLT , I)  Znreg,

x,CLT v = y, v (y, x)  Lv  Rn.

(4.32)

and

y  CL x (y, x)  L.

(4.33)

Proof. Clearly, if 2(Z) is nonsingular then rge Z  Zn. Further, given (y, 0)  rge Z, there is some p with y = 1(Z)p, 0 = 2(Z)p implying p = y = 0 and therefore rge Z  Znreg. Conversely, consider L  Znreg and Z  M (L). Because L  Zn, the matrix Z has full column rank n and therefore there cannot exist p = 0 with Z p = 0. Thus, if A := 2(Z) were singular, there is some 0 = p  Rn with Ap = 0 and Bp = 0 with B := 1(Z), implying (Bp, 0)  L and Bp = 0 which is not possible because of L  Znreg. This proves that A is nonsingular and L = rge ZA-1 = rge (CL, I) with CL = BA-1 follows.
Clearly, CL is uniquely given by L and does not depend on the particular choice of A and B. From L = rge (CL, I) we deduce L = rge (I, -CLT ) and L = SnL = rge (CLT , I). Further, for every p  Rn we have (p, -CLT p)  L, implying

p, y - CLT p, x = p, y -CLx = 0 (y, x)  L

and (4.32) follows. Finally, for every (y, x)  L there is some p  Rn with y = CL p, x = p implying (4.33)

Remark 4.4. Note that for every L  Znreg there holds CL = 1(Z)2(Z)-1 for every Z  M (L).

Comparing (4.32) with (4.29), we see that x = -CLT y is a solution to (4.29). We are now in the position to describe the iteration step of the SCD variant of the semismooth Newton method introduced in [14]. Assume we are given some iterate x(k). Since we cannot expect in general that F(x(k)) = 0/ or that 0 is close to F(x(k)), even if x(k) is close to a solution x¯, we first perform some preparatory step which yields (x^(k), y^(k))  gph F as an approximate projection of (x(k), 0) onto

gph F. We require that

(x^(k), y^(k)) - (x¯, 0)   x(k) - x¯

(4.34)

for some constant  > 0. E.g., if

(x^(k), y^(k)) - (x(k), 0)   dist((x(k), 0), gph F)

holds with some   1, then

(x^(k), y^(k)) - (x¯, 0)  (x^(k), y^(k)) - (x(k), 0) + (x(k), 0) - (x¯, 0)   dist((x(k), 0), gph F) + (x(k), 0) - (x¯, 0)  ( + 1) (x(k), 0) - (x¯, 0)

and (4.34) holds with  =  + 1. Further we require that S F(x^(k), y^(k))  Znreg = 0/ and compute the new iterate as x(k+1) = x^(k) -CLT y^(k) for some L  S F(x^(k), y^(k))  Znreg. In fact, in a numerical implementation we will not calculate the matrix CL, but two n × n matrices A, B such that L = rge (BT , AT ), compute x(k) as a solution of the system Ax = -By^(k) and set x(k+1) = x^(k) + x(k).
This leads to the following conceptual algorithm.

18

Algorithm 1 (SCD semismooth Newton-type method for inclusions). 1. Choose a starting point x(0), set the iteration counter k := 0. 2. If 0  F(x(k)), stop the algorithm.

3. Approximation step: Compute

(x^(k), y^(k))  gph F

satisfying (4.34) such that S F(x^(k), y^(k))  Znreg = 0/ . 4. Newton step: Select n × n matrices A(k), B(k) with L(k) := rge B(k)T , A(k)T )  S F(x^(k), y^(k)) 
Znreg, calculate the Newton direction x(k) as a solution of the linear system A(k)x = -B(k)y^(k) and obtain the new iterate via x(k+1) = x^(k) + x(k). 5. Set k := k + 1 and go to 2.

We have x(k) = -CLT(k)y^(k) and therefore (x(k), -y^(k))  -L(k) = L(k)  S F (x^(k), y^(k)) by Proposition 4.3. Thus, alternatively we can perform the Newton step also in the following way: 4. Newton step: Select n × n matrices A(k), B(k) with rge B(k), A(k))  S F (x^(k), y^(k))  Znreg, com-
pute a solution p of the linear system A(k) p = -y^(k) and compute the new iterate x(k+1) = x^(k) + x(k) with Newton direction x(k) = B(k) p.

Remark 4.5. Note that -y^(k)  DF(x^(k), y^(k))(x(k)) but we do not necessarily have -y^(k)  DF(x^(k), y^(k))(x(k)) as it is the case in Newton methods based on the graphical derivative, cf. [7, 17, 24].
Which possibility for calculating the Newton direction is actually chosen, depends on the availability of the respective derivative. Let us analyze the two alternatives for the special case when F is single-valued and continuously differentiable at x(k). In Algorithm 1, the matrices A(k), B(k) with rge B(k)T , A(k)T )  S F (x^(k), y^(k)) fulfill A(k)T = F(x^(k))T B(k)T and thus the Newton direction is computed by solving the linear system B(k)F(x^(k)) x = -B(k)y^(k). On the other hand, given A(k), B(k) with rge B(k), A(k))  S F(x^(k), y^(k)), we have A(k) = F(x^(k))B(k) and in this case the Newton direction is computed via x(k) = B(k) p = -B(k) F(x^(k))B(k) -1y^(k). The structure of the second approach resembles the adjoint system method known from PDE-constrained optimization and optimal control.
We now consider convergence of Algorithm 1.
Proposition 4.6. Assume that F : Rn  Rn is SCD semismooth at (x¯, y¯)  gph F. Then for every  > 0 there is is some  > 0 such that the inequality

x -CLT (y - y¯) - x¯   n(1 + CL 2) (x, y) - (x¯, y¯)

(4.35)

holds for every (x, y)  gph F  B (x¯, y¯) and every L  S F(x, y)  Znreg.
Proof. Pick  > 0 and choose  > 0 such that (4.30) holds. Now consider any (x, y)  gph F B (x¯, y¯) and any L  S F(x, y) Znreg. By Proposition 4.3 we have L = rge (CL, I) and therefore (CLei, ei)  L, i = 1, . . . , n, where ei denotes the i-th unit vector. From (4.30) we obtain
| ei, x¯ - x - CLei, y¯ - y | = | ei, x -CLT (y - y¯) - x¯ |   (ei,CLei) (x, y) - (x¯, y¯)

  1 + CL 2 (x, y) - (x¯, y¯)

and follows.

x -CLT (y - y¯) - x¯   n(1 + CL 2) (x, y) - (x¯, y¯)

19

Given ,  > 0, we now define for x  Rn the set

GF,x,¯ (x) := {(x^, y^, L) | (x^, y^)  gph F, (x^, y^) - (x¯, 0)   x - x¯ , L  S F(x^, y^)  Znreg, CL  }.

Theorem 4.7. Assume that F is SCD semismooth at (x¯, 0)  gph F and assume that there are ,  > 0 such that for every x  F-1(0) sufficiently close to x¯ we have GFL,,x¯ (x) = 0/ . Then there exists some  > 0 such that for every starting point x(0)  B (x¯) Algorithm 1 either stops after finitely many iterations at a solution or produces a sequence x(k) which converges superlinearly to x¯, provided we choose in every iteration (x^(k), y^(k), L(k))  GF,x,¯ (x(k)).

Proof. Using Proposition 4.6 with y¯ = 0, we can find some ¯ > 0 such that (4.35) holds with  =

by Proposition 4.6. It follows that for every starting point x(0)  B (x¯) Algorithm 1 either stops after finitely many iterations with a solution or produces a sequence x(k) converging to x¯. The superlinear convergence of the sequence x(k) is now an easy consequence of Proposition 4.6.

So far Algorithm 1 is only a straightforward adaption of the semismooth Newton method from [14] to SCD mappings. However, in [14] the semismooth Newton method was only guaranteed to
converge under the assumption of strong metric regularity, whereas we will now prove that for its
SCD variant a less restrictive condition is sufficient.

Definition 4.8. A mapping F : Rn  Rn is called SCD regular around (x, y)  gph F, if F has the SCD property around (x, y) and

(y, 0)  L  y = 0, L  S F(x, y),

(4.36)

i.e., S F(x, y) = S F(x, y)  Znreg. Further, we will denote by

scd reg F(x, y) := sup{ CL | L  S F(x, y)}

the modulus of SCD regularity of F around (x, y).

By isometry of the mapping L  L and Proposition 4.3 we obtain readily the following lemma.

Lemma 4.9. The mapping F : Rn  Rn is SCD regular around (x¯, y¯)  gph F if and only if

(u, 0)  L  u = 0, L  S F(x, y).

(4.37)

Further, scd reg F(x, y) = sup{ CL | L  S F(x, y)}.
Remark 4.10. In case of a single-valued, locally Lipschitzian mapping F : Rn  Rn, by virtue of Lemma 3.11, SCD regularity of F around x¯ means that all matrices belonging to the B-subdifferential are nonsingular. This is exactly the so-called BD-regularity property from [28].

20

Note that SCD regularity is weaker than the metric regularity of F around (x, y). Indeed, condition (2.6) for metric regularity of F near (x, y) can be equivalently written as

(y, 0)  gph DF(x, y)  y = 0.

and every subspace L  S F(x, y) is contained in gph DF(x, y) by Lemma 3.7. The next example shows that SCD regularity is even strictly weaker than metric regularity, see also Example 5.5 below.

Example 4.11. Consider the SCD mapping

F(x) := -x + NR-(x) =  q(x)

with

q(x)

=

at (0, 0). Then



 {0}

DF

(0,

0)(y

)

R R+

if y < 0 if y = 0 if y > 0

and therefore the only subspaces contained in gph DF(0, 0) are {(y, -y) | y  R} and {0} ×
R. Hence F is SCD regular at (0, 0), but F is not metrically regular near (0, 0) because of 0  DF(0, 0)(1).

Lemma 4.12. Let F : Rn  Rn be SCD regular around (x, y)  gph F. Then scd reg F(x, y) < .

Proof. Assume on the contrary that there is a sequence Lk  S F(x, y) with CLk > k. Then we can

find (yk, xk)  Lk such that

and L  S F(x, y) of SCD regularity.

Lemma

3.13.

Therefore,

Proposition 4.13. Assume that F : Rn  Rn is SCD regular around (x¯, y¯)  gph F. Then for every  > scd reg F(x¯, y¯) there is a neighborhood W of (x¯, y¯) such that for every (x, y)  gph F  W the mapping F is SCD regular around (x, y) with modulus

scd reg F(x, y)  .

Proof. By contraposition. Consider  > scd reg F(x¯, y¯) and assume that there are sequences (xk, yk) g-phF(x¯, y¯)

and Lk  S F(xk, yk) with CLk > . Then for every k we can find (yk, xk)  Lk, yk = 1 and

Proposition 4.14. Let F : Rn  Rn be SCD regular around (x¯, 0)  gph F. Then for every  > 0 and every  > scd reg F(x¯, 0) there is a neighborhood U of x¯ such that

GF,x,¯ (x) = {(x^, y^, L) | (x^, y^)  gph F, (x^, y^) - (x¯, 0)   x - x¯ , L  S F(x^, y^)} = 0/ x  U.

Proof. By Proposition 4.13 we can find some positive radius  such that F is SCD regular around
(x, y) with modulus scd reg F(x, y)   for every (x, y)  gph F  B(x¯, 0). By taking U := B/(x¯), for every x  U and every (x^, y^)  gph F with (x^, y^) - (x¯, 0)   x - x¯ we have (x^, y^)  B(x¯, 0)
and the assertion follows.

21

Corollary 4.15. Assume that F is SCD semismooth at (x¯, 0)  gph F and SCD regular around (x¯, 0). Then for every  > 0 there is a neighborhood U of x¯ such that for every starting point x(0)  U Algorithm 1 is well-defined and either stops after finitely many iterations at a solution of (4.28) or produces a sequence x(k) converging superlinearly to x¯ for any choice of (x^(k), y^(k)) satisfying (4.34) and any L(k)  S F(x^(k), y^(k)).
Remark 4.16. Note that Corollary 4.15 guarantees not only locally superlinear convergence, but also that the method is locally well-defined, which is an advantage in comparison with the Josephy-Newton method from [18]. In Theorem 5.2 below we will show that, under the assumptions of Corollary 4.15, the mapping F is strongly metrically subregular at (x¯, 0). Hence, by [5, Theorem 6.1], the convergence of the Josephy-Newton method is also locally superlinear, provided the method is well-defined. This, however, need not be the case as illustrated in [14, Example 5.13], where the assumptions of Corollary 4.15 are fulfilled, the semismooth Newton method works well, but the Jospehy-Newton method collapses.

5 Strong metric subregularity on a neighborhood

We first present a characterization of strong metric subregularity on a neighborhood, cf. Definition 2.8, by means of the outer limiting graphical derivative defined in Definition 3.8.

Theorem 5.1. Consider a mapping F : Rn  Rn and let (x¯, y¯)  gph F. Then F is strongly metrically subregular around (x¯, y¯) if and only if the condition

0  DF(x¯, y¯)(u)  u = 0

(5.38)

holds and in this case one has l-subreg F(x¯, y¯) = sup{ u | v : (u, v)  gph DF(x¯, y¯), v  1}.

(5.39)

Proof. We prove the "if"-part by contraposition. Assume that (5.38) holds but F is not strongly metrically subregular around (x¯, y¯). Then we can find a sequence (xk, yk) g-phF(x¯, y¯) such that either F is not strongly metrically subregular at (xk, yk) for infinitely many k or lim supk subreg F(xk, yk) = . After possibly passing to some subsequence, by taking into account Theorem 2.7, in both cases there
is a sequence k   and (uk, vk)  gph DF(xk, yk) with vk  1 such that uk > k vk . Defining (u~k, v~k) := (uk, vk)/ uk  gph DF(xk, yk), we have v~k  1/k implying limk v~k = 0. By possibly passing to a subsequence once more, u~k converges to some u with u = 1 and from the definition of DF(x¯, y¯) we obtain (u, 0)  gph DF(x¯, y¯) contradicting (5.38). This proves the "if"-
part. In order to show the "only if"-part assume that (5.38) does not hold, so that there is some u = 0 with (u, 0)  gph DF(x¯, y¯). By definition of DF(x¯, y¯) there are sequences (xk, yk) g-phF(x¯, y¯) and (uk, vk)  (u, 0) with (uk, vk)  gph DF(xk, yk). If F is not strongly metrically subregular at (xk, yk) for infinitely many k, then it is not strongly metrically subregular around (x¯, y¯) by definition. On the other
hand, if F is strongly metrically subregular at (xk, yk) then vk = 0 and subreg F(xk, yk)  uk / vk follows by Theorem 2.7. Hence, lim supk subreg F(xk, yk) =  and F is again not strongly metrically subregular around (x¯, y¯). This proves the "only if"-part. There remains to show (5.39). By
definition we have

l-subreg F(x¯, y¯) = lim sup sup{ u | v : (u, v)  gph DF(x, y), v  1}
(x,y) g-ph F(x¯,y¯)

22

and therefore there are sequences (xk, yk) g-phF(x¯, y¯) and (uk, vk)  gph DF(xk, yk) with vk  1 and

uk  l-subreg F(x¯, y¯) < . By possibly passing to a subsequence, (uk, vk) converges to some (u, v)

with v  1. By definition of DF we have (u, v)  gph DF(x¯, y¯) and l-subreg F(x¯, y¯) = u 

 := sup{ u | v : (u, v)  gph DF(x¯, y¯), v  1} follows. Next consider a sequence (uk, vk) 

gph DF(x¯, y¯) with vk  1 and uk   . Then for every k there are (xk, yk)  gph F and (uk, vk) 

gph DF(xk, yk) such that

(xk, yk) - (x¯, y¯)



1 k

and

(

uk, vk) - (uk, vk)



1 k

and

subreg F(xk, yk)  k :=

uk vk
uk

if vk > 1 if vk  1

follows. In case when vk > 1 we have

|

uk vk

- uk | =

vk - 1 vk

uk



k

1 +

1

uk

and limk k =  follows. Hence l-subreg F(x¯, y¯)  lim supk k =  and relation (5.39) is established.

From Lemma 3.10 together with Lemma 4.9, we may conclude that strong metric subregularity around (x¯, y¯)  gph F implies SCD regularity around (x¯, y¯) and that l-subreg F(x¯, y¯)  scd reg F(x¯, y¯). Next we show that SCD regularity in conjunction with SCD semismoothness* also provides a sufficient condition for strong metric subregularity.

Theorem 5.2. Assume that F : Rn  Rn is SCD regular around (x¯, y¯)  gph F. Then for every  >
scd reg F(x¯, y¯) there is a neighborhood W of (x¯, y¯) such that F is strongly metrically subregular with modulus subreg F(x, y)   at every point (x, y)  gph F W where F is SCD semismooth .

Proof. Fixing  > scd reg F(x¯, y¯), by Proposition 4.13 there is an open neighborhood W of (x¯, y¯)
such that for every (x, y)  gph F  W the mapping F is SCD regular around (x, y) with modulus scd reg F(x, y)   . Consider (x~, y~)  gph F  W where F is SCD semismooth . Assume now that F is not metrically subregular at (x~, y~) or that subreg F(x~, y~) > . Then there is some  >  and a sequence xk converging to x~ such that dist(xk, F-1(y~)) >  dist(y~, F(xk)) k. Consider yk 
F(xk) with dist(y~, F(xk)) = yk - y~ . Then yk converges to y~ and for all k sufficiently large we have (xk, yk)  gph F  W . Pick Lk  S F(xk, yk). Using Propositions 4.6, 4.13 and, by possibly passing
to a subsequence, we may assume that CLk   k and

xk - CLTk(yk - y~) - x~

1 k

n(1 +

CLk

2) (xk - x~, yk - y~)

1 k

n(1 + 2)( xk - x~ + yk - y~ )

implying

(1 - k) xk - x~  CLk (yk - y~) + k yk - y~  ( + k) yk - y~ ,

where k := ciently large

1 k
and

n(1 + 2). therefore

Since xk - x~

k  < 

0 as k  , we have ( + k)/(1 - k) <  for all k suffiyk - y~ in contrary to our assumption. This shows that F is

metrically subregular at (x~, y~) and subreg F(x~, y~)  . Further x~ must be an isolated point in F-1(y~).

Assume on the contrary that there is a sequence xk  F-1(y~) converging to x~. Taking Lk  S F(xk, y~) and applying Proposition 4.6 with  = 1/(2 n(1 + 2), we obtain for all k sufficiently large

xk - x~

=

xk -CLTk(y~ - y~) - x~

1 2

(xk - x~, y~ - y~)

=1 2

xk - x~ ,

a contradiction. This shows that F is even strongly metrically subregular at (x~, y~).

23

Remark 5.3. In the special case of a single-valued locally Lipschitzian mapping F : Rn  Rn the statement of Theorem 5.2 can be derived also from [15, Proposition 1].
For semismooth mappings we arrive thus at the following equivalence.
Corollary 5.4. Assume that F : Rn  Rn is SCD semismooth around (x¯, y¯)  gph F. Then F is strongly metrically subregular around (x¯, y¯) if and only if F is SCD regular around (x¯, y¯) and in this case one has l-subreg F(x¯, y¯) = scd reg F(x¯, y¯).
Example 5.5. Consider the mapping F := R2  R2 given by

F(x1, x2) :=

x1 -x2

+ h(x) + NC(x1, x2),

where C := {(x1, x2) |

and

h : R2  R2

is any

con-

tinuously differentiable mapping satisfying h(0, 0) = (0, 0), h(0, 0) = 0. As the reference point we

take (x¯, y¯) = (0, 0), (0, 0) . The mapping NC is a polyhedral mapping and therefore semismooth
at any point of its graph by [14]. Further, NC(x) =  C(x) is an SCD mapping by Corollary 3.28. Thus, F is both an SCD mapping around and semismooth at any point of its graph, because it differs

from NC only by a continuously differentiable mapping. Now let us calculate S F(x¯, y¯). The critical

cone KC(x¯, y¯) and {(0, 0)}.

T L4 = {((0, 0), (u, v)) |

Now it easily follows that F is SCD regular around (x¯, y¯) with

CT L1 =

and

(x¯, y¯)

with

To illustrate this result, we explicitly compute F-1 in case h = 0. One obtains that

6 On strong metric regularity

Our results on strong metric regularity are partly expressed in terms of certain bases for the subspaces L  S F(x¯, y¯).
Given a mapping F : Rn  Rn which is graphically Lipschitzian of dimension n at (x¯, y¯)  gph F with transformation mapping  according to Definition 3.16, we denote by ¯ F(x¯, y¯) the collection of all 2n × n matrices Z such that rge Z  S F(x¯, y¯) and 1((x¯, y¯)Z) = I.
Note that by Proposition 3.17 for every L  S F(x¯, y¯) there exists a unique Z  ¯ F(x¯, y¯) M (L). Since for every Lipschitzian mapping f : U  Rn, U  Rn open, the B-subdifferential  f (u) is compact for every u  U , we conclude from (3.23a) that F(x¯, y¯) is compact as well.
The next statement provides us with an upper approximation of the graphs of the strict derivative and the limiting coderivative, respectively.
Proposition 6.1. Let F : Rn  Rn be graphically Lipschitzian at (x¯, y¯)  gph F with transformation mapping . Then

gph DF(x¯, y¯) 

rge Z,

Zconv F(x¯,y¯)

gph DF(x¯, y¯) 

(rge Z)

Zconv F(x¯,y¯)

(6.41) (6.42)

Proof. According to Definition 3.16 consider the open neighborhoods W of (x¯, y¯), U of w¯ and the Lipschtitzian mapping f : U  Rn with (gph F  W ) = gph f , where w¯ = 1((x¯, y¯)). Consider (u, v)  gph DF(x¯, y¯) together with sequences (x1k, y1k) g-ph F(x¯, y¯), (x2k, y2k) g-ph F(x¯, y¯) and tk  0 such that (u, v) = limk(x2k - x1k , y2k - y1k)/tk. For each k let wik, i = 1, 2 be given by wik = 1((xik, yik)). Then
(w2k - w1k, f (w2k ) - f (w1k)) = (x2k , y2k ) - (x1k, y1k ) = (x¯, y¯)(x2k - x1k, y2k - y1k) + o( (x2k - x1k, y2k - y1k) ) = (x¯, y¯)(x2k - x1k, y2k - y1k) + o(tk)

implying that

gph D

f (w¯).

Hence 2((x¯)(u, v))  D f (w¯)(1((x¯)(u, v))) and by [33, Theorem 9.62] there is some B  conv  f (w¯) satisfying 2((x¯)(u, v)) = B1((x¯)(u, v)) which is the same as (x¯)(u, v)  rge (I, B).

25

B can be expressed as a convex combination Ni=1 iBi with Bi   f (w¯ ), i  0, Ni=1 i = 1 and therefore

N
(u, v)  (x¯, y¯)-1rge (I, B) = (x¯, y¯)-1rge i
i=1

I Bi

N
= rge i(x¯, y¯)-1
i=1

I Bi

.

Denoting Zi := (x¯, y¯)-1

I Bi

we have rge Zi  S F(x¯, y¯) by (3.23a) and 1((x¯, y¯)Zi) = I yielding

Zi  F(x¯, y¯). Thus (u, v)  rge Z with Z = Ni=1 iZi  conv F(x¯, y¯) verifying (6.41). Now consider (y, x)  gph DF(x¯, y¯) which is the same as

SnT (y, x)  NgphF (x¯, y¯) = (x¯, y¯)T Ngph f (w¯, f (w¯ ),
where the second equality follows from [33, Exercise 6.7]. Hence z := Sn(x¯, y¯)-T SnT (y, x)  SnNgph f (w¯, f (w¯) = gph D f (w¯) implying 2(z)  D f (w¯)(1(z)). By [33, Theorem 9.62] there is some B  conv  f (w¯) such that 2(z) = BT 1(z) which is the same as z  rge (I, BT ) and

(y, x)  rge Sn(x¯, y¯)T SnT

I BT

follows. Taking into account that

rge Sn(x¯, y¯)T SnT

I BT


= rge

Sn(x¯, y¯)-1SnT

B -I

= rge - Sn(x¯, y¯)-1

I B

we obtain

rge Sn(x¯, y¯)T SnT

I BT


= Snrge

- Sn(x¯, y¯)-1

I B

= rge (x¯, y¯)-1

I B

.

As we have shown above, the latter subspace equals to rge Z with Z  conv F(x¯, y¯) and (y, x)  (rge Z) follows.

On the basis of Proposition 6.1 we can now establish the following characterization of strong metric regularity.

Theorem 6.2. Consider a mapping F : Rn  Rn and let (x¯, y¯)  gph F.

(i) If F is strongly metrically regular around (x¯, y¯) then it is graphically Lipschitzian of dimen-
sion n at (x¯, y¯) with transformation mapping (x, y) = (y, x) and one has that {rge Z | Z  conv F(x¯, y¯)}  Znreg. Further, F is SCD regular around (x¯, y¯) and reg F(x¯, y¯) = scd reg F(x¯, y¯).

(ii) Conversely, if F is graphically Lipschitzian of dimension n at (x¯, y¯) with some transformation mapping  such that {rge Z | Z  conv F(x¯, y¯)}  Znreg then F is strongly metrically regular
around (x¯, y¯).

Proof. If F is strongly metrically regular around (x¯, y¯), then by Theorem 2.6 it is clearly graphi-

cally Lipschitzian with the given transformation mapping  and from Proposition 3.17 we obtain S F(x¯, y¯) = {rge (B, I) | B   f (y¯)} where f denotes the Lipschitz continuous localization of F-1

around (y¯, x¯). Thus

F(x¯, y¯) =

B I

| B   f (y¯)

26

and consequently every matrix Z  conv F(x¯, y¯) is of the form Z =

B I

with B  conv  f (y¯).

From this we can easily deduce that L := rge Z  Znreg and B = CL showing that F is SCD regular. In

order to verify the formula for the modulus of strong metric regularity we use (2.9). Let  > 0 and

consider (u, v)  gph DF(x¯, y¯) with v  1 and u  reg F(x¯, y¯) - . By Proposition 6.1 there is some Z  conv F(x¯, y¯) and some w  Rn with (u, v) = Zw. Thus there is B¯  conv  f (y¯) such that

u = B¯w and v = w yielding

reg F(x¯, y¯) -   u  B¯ v  B¯  sup{ B | B  conv  f (y¯)} = sup{ B | B   f (y¯)} = sup{ CL | L  S F(x¯, y¯)} = scd reg F(x¯, y¯).

Since  > 0 can be chosen arbitrarily small, there holds reg F(x¯, y¯)  scd reg F(x¯, y¯). On the other hand, for every L  S F(x¯, y¯) we have L  gph DF(x¯, y¯)  gph DF(x¯, y¯) implying

CL  sup{ u | (u, v)  gph DF(x¯, y¯), v = 1}

and consequently scd reg F(x¯, y¯)  reg F(x¯, y¯). This proves (i). The statement (ii) follows from Theorem 2.7 together with Proposition 6.1. If 0  gph DF(x¯, y¯)(u)
then there is some Z  conv F(x¯, y¯) such that (u, 0)  rge Z and u = 0 follows from rge Z  Znreg. Similarly, if 0  DF(x¯, y¯)(y) then there is some Z  conv F(x¯, y¯) such that (y, 0)  (rge Z). Since rge Z  Znreg, we have (rge Z)  Znreg by Proposition 4.3 and y = 0 follows. Hence, both (2.8) and (2.6) are fulfilled and strong metric regularity of F has been established.

Consider the special case of a single-valued Lipschitzian mapping F : Rn  Rn so that (x, y) = (x, y). Then F(x, F(x)) = {(I, B) | B  F(x)} by Lemma 3.11 and therefore

conv F(x, F(x)) = {(I, B) | B  conv F(x)}.

Thus the requirement in Theorem 6.2(ii) that {rge Z | Z  conv F(x¯, y¯)}  Znreg is equivalent to the condition that every matrix B belonging to Clarke's generalized Jacobian conv F(x) is nonsingular. Therefore we may consider Theorem 6.2(ii) as a generalization of Clarke's Inverse Function Theorem,
see, e.g., [6, Theorem 7.1.1], to set-valued mappings. Note that reg F(x¯, y¯) = scd reg F(x¯, y¯) whenever F is strongly metrically regular around (x¯, y¯). In
the following results, where we present sufficient conditions for strong metric regularity, this statement
will not be repeated.
The sufficient condition for strong metric regularity in Theorem 6.2(ii) depends on the particular basis representation F(x¯, y¯) of S F(x¯, y¯). We now want to formulate sufficient conditions for strong metric regularity in terms of the elements L  S F(x¯, y¯) itself which do not depend on a basis.

Corollary 6.3. Given F : Rn  Rn and a point (x¯, y¯)  gph F, assume that S F(x¯, y¯) = {L¯ } is a singleton. Then F is strongly metrically regular around (x¯, y¯) if and only if F is graphically Lipschitzian of dimension n at (x¯, y¯) and L¯  Znreg.
When S F(x¯, y¯) is a singleton and F is not graphically Lipschitzian at (x¯, y¯) then F cannot be strongly metrically regular by Theorem 6.2(i). However, if F is SCD semismooth at (around) (x¯, y¯), then it is at least strongly metrically subregular at (around) (x¯, y¯). Consider the following example.

27

Example

6.4.

Let q : R  R be given

by

q(x) =

2 3

sign

(x)|x|

3 2

.

Then



q(x)

=

|x|

1 2

is

not graphically

Lipschitzian of dimension 1 at (0, 0) but it is an SCD mapping and SCD semismooth . Further,

S  q(0, 0) = {{0} × R} is a singleton and clearly {0} × R  Znreg. Thus we deduce from Corollary

5.4 that  q is strongly metrically subregular around (0, 0). However  q is not strongly metrically

regular around (0, 0) because  q-1(y) = 0/ for every y < 0.

We will now present a basis-independent characterization of strong metric regularity for locally maximally hypomonotone mappings.

Theorem 6.5. Assume that F : Rn  Rn is locally maximally hypomonotone at (x¯, y¯)  gph F. Then the following two statements are equivalent:

(i) F is SCD regular around (x¯, y¯) and for every L  S F(x¯, y¯) the matrix CL is positive semidefinite. (ii) F is strongly metrically regular around (x¯, y¯) and

lim inf
(x1,y1),(x2,y2) g-phF(x¯,y¯)

x1 - x2, y1 - y2 x1 - x2 y1 - y2

0

(6.43)

with the convention 0/0 := 0.

Proof. We first prove (i)(ii). By Corollary 3.23 there is some   1 such that F is graphically Lipschitzian at (x¯, y¯) with transformation mapping (x, y) = ( x + y, x) and for every Z  F(x¯, y¯)

there is a firmly nonexpansive n × n matrix B, such that Z =

B I-B

. Since F is SCD regular

around (x¯, y¯), 2(Z) = I -  B is nonsingular and Crge Z = B(I -  B)-1. Consider u  Rn and set v := (I -  B)u. By the posed assumption, B(I -  B)-1 is positive semidefinite and we obtain

0   v, B(I -  B)-1v =  v, Bu =  (I -  B)u, Bu

implying u,  Bu   Bu 2. Thus  B is firmly nonexpansive and, consequently, 2 B - I  1.

Since I -  B is nonsingular, we deduce from [3, Theorem 3.3] that  B < 1. Now consider Z¯ 

conv F(x¯, y¯). It follows that Z¯ =

B¯ I -  B¯

, where B¯ is some convex combination of matrices Bi

with  Bi < 1 and 2 Bi -I  1. It follows that  B¯ < 1 and 2 B¯ -I  1. Thus 2(Z¯) = I - B¯ is nonsingular and from Proposition 4.3 we may deduce that rge Z¯  Znreg. Now strong regularity of

F follows from Theorem 6.2(ii). Next we prove (6.43) by contraposition. Assume on the contrary

that there are sequences (xik, yik) g-phF(x¯, y¯), i = 1, 2, and some  > 0 such that x1k - x2k, y1k - y2k <

- and

x1k - x2k therefore

y1k - y2k for  > 1 and

all k. By local hypomonotonicity,

x1k - x2k



  -1

y1k - y2k

.

On the

x1k - other

x2k , y1k - y2k  -( - 1) hand, by strong metric

x1k - x2k 2 regularity,

choosing c > reg F(x¯, y¯), we have x1k - x2k  c y1k - y2k for all k sufficiently large. Let tk := y1k -

y2k + x1k - x2k DF(x¯, y¯) with

.

By u

possibly +v =

  -1

to v

a subsequence,  u c v

(x1k - x2k , and u, v

y1k - y2k )/tk  - u

converges to some (u, v)  v . We deduce that both

u and v are nonzero and thus u, v < 0. By Proposition 6.1 there is some Z¯  conv F(x¯, y¯) and

some p  Rn with (u, v) = Z¯ p. As shown above, Z¯ =

B¯ I -  B¯

for some n × n matrix B¯ with

2 B¯ - I  1, i.e.,  B¯ is firmly nonexpansive. It follows that

0  p,  B¯ p -  B¯ p 2 =  B¯ p, p -  B¯ p =  u, v ,

28

contradicting u, v < 0. Hence the implication (i)(ii) is verified.
To show the reverse implication note that strong metric regularity implies SCD regularity by The-
orem 6.2. We prove that CL is positive semidefinite for every L  S F(x¯, y¯) by contradiction. Assume that there exists some L  S F(x¯, y¯) and p  Rn with CL p, p < 0. Since (CL p, p)  L  DF(x¯, y¯)  DF(x¯, y¯), there are sequences tk  0, (xk, yk) g-ph F(x¯, y¯) and (uk, vk)  (CL p, p) with (xk, yk) := (xk, yk) + tk(uk, vk). It follows that (xk - xk)/ xk - xk = uk/ uk  CL p, (yk - yk)/ yk - yk = vk/ vk  p/ p and therefore

lim

xk - xk, yk - yk xk - xk yk - yk

(6.44)

contradicting (6.43).

Corollary 6.6. Let F : Rn  Rn be locally monotone around (x¯, y¯)  gph F. Then the following statements are equivalent.

(i) F is strongly metrically regular around (x¯, y¯).

(ii) F is metrically regular around (x¯, y¯).

(iii) F is SCD regular around (x¯, y¯) and locally maximally monotone at (x¯, y¯).

In this case, the matrices CL, L  S F(x¯, y¯), are positive semidefinite.

Proof. The equivalence between (i) and (ii) follows from the definitions of (strong) metric regularity
and [10, Theorem 3G.5]. In view of Theorem 6.5, in order to verify (i)(iii), we only have to show that F is locally maximally monotone. By taking into account that gph F-1 = {(y, x) | (x, y)  gph F}, it follows readily from the definition that F is locally maximally monotone at (x¯, y¯) if and only if F-1 is locally maximally monotone at (y¯, x¯). F-1 has a Lipschitz continuous monotone localization and is therefore locally maximally monotone at (y¯, x¯) by [22, Lemma 2.1]. This proves (i)(iii). We now claim that (iii) implies that CL is positive semidefinite for every L  S F(x¯, y¯). Assuming that CL is not positive semidefinite for some L  S F(x¯, y¯), the same arguments as in the proof of Theorem 6.5
can be used to obtain (6.44) contradicting the local monotonicity of F. Hence our claim holds true
and the implication (iii)(i) follows from Theorem 6.5.

Remark 6.7. Theorem 6.5 improves the sufficient conditions for strong metric regularity obtained by Nghia et al [25]. E.g., in [25, Corollary 3.11] it is shown that F : Rn  Rn is strongly metrically regular around (x¯, y¯) if

(a) F is locally hypomonotone at (x¯, y¯) and
(b) DF(x¯, y¯) is positive definite in the sense that u, v > 0 holds for all u  DF(x¯, y¯)(v), v = 0.

We now show that these assumptions imply the assumptions of Theorem 6.5(i). Indeed, by the definiteness of the coderivative DF(x¯, y¯) together with the Mordukhovich criterion (2.6) we may de-
duce that F is metrically regular around (x¯, y¯) and therefore SCD regular as well. Further, for every L  S F(x¯, y¯) we have rge (CLT , I)  gph DF(x¯, y¯) by Proposition 4.3 and Remark 3.5 implying CLT p, p > 0 for all p with CLT p = 0 by assumption (b). Hence, CL is positive semidefinite. By assumption (a) there is some   0 such that I + F is locally monotone at (x¯, y¯) and, since

29

D(I + F)(x¯, x¯ + y¯) = I + DF(x¯, y¯) is positive definite, we conclude from the Mordukhovich criterion that I + F is metrically regular around (x¯, x¯ + y¯). Thus, by Corollary 6.6, the mapping I + F is locally maximally monotone at (x¯, x¯ + y¯) and F is locally maximally hypomonotone at (x¯, y¯) by
the definition. Hence, we have shown that the assumptions of Theorem 6.5(i) are weaker than those of [25, Corollary 3.11]. When we now consider, e.g., the mapping F(x1, x2) = (-x2, x1) and an arbitrary reference point (x¯, F(x¯)), we observe that the positive definiteness assumption (b) is not fulfilled.
Nevertheless, Theorem 6.5 works well and so it in fact improves the mentioned statement in [25].

We now turn our attention to the characterization of tilt-stable minimizers by SCD regularity of the subdifferential.
Definition 6.8 (tilt-stable minimizers). Let q : Rn  R¯ , and let x¯  dom q. Then:

(i) x¯ is a tilt-stable local minimizer of q if there is a number  > 0 such that the mapping

M (x) := arg min q(x) - x, x | x  B(x¯) , x  Rn,

(6.45)

is single-valued and Lipschitz continuous in some neighborhood of x¯ = 0  Rn with M (0) = {x¯}.

(ii) The exact bound of tilt stability of q at x¯ is defined by

tilt (q, x¯) := lim sup
v ,w 0

M (v) - M(w) v - w

.

v =w

(6.46)

The theory developed in Section 4 enables us to provide a new characterization of tilt-stable local minimizers.
Theorem 6.9. For a function q : Rn  R¯ having 0   q(x¯) and such that q is both prox-regular and subdifferentially continuous at x¯ for x¯ = 0, the following statements are equivalent:

(i) x¯ is a tilt-stable local minimizer of q.

(ii)  q is SCD regular around (x¯, 0) and CL is positive semidefinite for every L  S  q(x¯, 0). Further, if x¯ is a tilt-stable minimizer of q then tilt (q, x¯) = scd reg  q(x¯, 0).

Proof. If x¯ is a tilt-stable minimizer, we may conclude from [27, Theorem 1.3] that the mapping M is a single-valued Lipschitzian localization of  q-1 around (0, x¯) so that  q is strongly metrically regular around (x¯, 0) and tilt (q, x¯) = reg  q(x¯, 0) = scd reg  q(x¯, 0). By [27, Theorem 1.3], statement (i) is equivalent to the condition
(iii) The coderivative D q(x¯, 0) is positive definite in the sense that

v, u > 0 whenever u  DF(x¯, y¯)(v), v = 0.

(6.47)

So it suffices to prove the equivalence (ii)(iii).
Proof that (ii) (iii). By Proposition 3.26, there is some  > 0 such that  q is graphically Lipschitzian with transformation mapping (x, x) = (x +  x, x). Further, any Z  ¯  q(x¯, 0) satisfies

30

rge Z = (rge Z) and is of the form Z =

B

1 

(I

-

B)

, where B is some symmetric positive semidef-

inite n × n matrix. Consider Z  ¯  q(x¯, 0) and set B := 1(Z). Since  q is SCD regular around

(x¯, 0),

the

matrix

is

nonsingular

by

Proposition

If

the

eigenvalues of B are denoted by µ1, . . . , µn, the eigenvalues of CL are  µi/(1 - µi), i = 1, . . . , n, and,

together with µi  0, we conclude that CL is positive semidefinite if and only if max µi = B < 1.. Since  q(x¯; 0) is compact, it follows that  := max{ 1(Z) | Z   q(x¯; 0)} < 1. Now consider (v, u)  gph DF(x¯, y¯). By Proposition 6.1 there is some Z¯  conv  q(x¯, 0) such that (v, u) 

(rge Z¯). The matrix B¯ := 1(Z¯) is a convex combination of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices

Bi satisfying Bi  . Thus B¯ is symmetric positive semidefinite and B¯   < 1. By taking into

The matrix B¯(I - B¯) is symmetric and has eigenvalues µi(1 - µi), where µ1, . . . , µn are the eigenvalues of B¯. Since 0  µi   < 1, i = 1, . . . , n, the matrix B¯(I -B¯) is positive semidefinite implying v, u  0. Further, pT B¯(I - B¯)p vanishes if and only if p is a linear combination of eigenvectors associated with the zero eigenvalues of B¯, i.e., B¯ p = v = 0 and (6.47) follows .
Proof that (iii)  (ii). Condition (6.47) implies that the Mordukhovich criterion (2.6) is fulfilled
and we may conclude that  q is SCD regular around (x¯, 0). Further, for every L  S F(x¯, 0) we have L = rge (CLT , I)  gph D q(x¯, 0) by Proposition 4.3 and Lemma 3.7 and therefore (CLT p, p)  gph D q(x¯, 0) p. From (6.47) we deduce CLT p, p > 0 for all p with CLT p = 0 and the positive semidefiniteness of CLT and CL follows.

Example 6.10. Consider again the mapping F : R2  R2 from Example 5.5. If h =  for some potential  : Rn  R, we see that the inclusion 0  F(x) describes in fact the first-order optimality
condition for the optimization problem

Since CTL1 is not positive semidefinite, we conclude from Theorem 6.9 that x¯ = 0 is not a tilt stable local minimizer. This is also in accordance with [27, Theorem 4.5].

7 Conclusion
Subspaces contained in the graph of the limiting coderivative may definitely serve as a basis for construction of suitable local approximations in the broad class of SCD multifunctions. It came to us, however, as a surprise that these subspaces and their counterparts in case of the limiting outer graphical derivative conceal a lot of information about stability behavior of the considered mappings. The developed theory makes use of notions, mimicking the generalized derivatives and coderivatives in the "standard" generalized differential calculus. However, their structure is, in most cases, somewhat simpler when compared with the standard notions and so the derived new characterization of strong metric (sub)regularity and tilt stability are typically easier to work with. Finally, let us point out that the property of strong metric subregularity around the reference point, characterized via the subspaces contained in the limiting outer graphical derivative, seems to be a weak stability property ensuring the locally superlinear convergence of the semismooth* Newton method.
