A VELOCITY ALIGNMENT MODEL ON QUOTIENT SPACES OF THE EUCLIDEAN SPACE
HANSOL PARK
Abstract. The Cucker-Smale(CS) model is a velocity alignment model, and this model also has been generalized on general manifolds. We modify the CS model on manifolds to get rid of a-priori condition on particles' positions and conditions on communication functions. Since the shortest geodesic is used to define an interaction between two particles, if there exist two or more than two shortest geodesics, then the system is not well-defined. In this paper, instead of using the shortest geodesic to define an interaction between two particles, we use all geodesics to define an interaction. From this assumption, we can relax the a-priori condition and conditions on communication functions. We also explain the relationship between the suggested model and previous models. Finally, we provide some emergent behaviors on some specific manifolds(e.g. flat torus, flat M¨obius strip, and flat Klein bottle). From these results, we can discuss the effect of the topology of the domain.

1. Introduction

Analyzing the emergent behavior of dynamical systems is a one of the important part of the applied mathematics. It can be used to analyze the following phenomenon: flashing of fireflies [5], schooling of fish [4, 10, 20]. Also, it can be applied to unmanned aerial vehicles [3], cooperative robot systems [14, 19, 21], variational method [7, 8, 13], shape matching problem [16], rotation averaging problem [17], and minimization problem [18]. In this paper, we study a velocity alignment model intensively. One of the famous velocity alignment model is the Cucker-Smale(CS) model studied in [9], and this model is given as follows:

x i = vi, t > 0,

occurs. System (1.1) is cefined on the Euclidean space. A canonical generalization of this work is extension of the model on general manifolds. This extension is studied in [15], and

This

model

was

studied

on

the

sphere

[15,

2],

the

hyperbolic space H2 [1], the special orthogonal group SO(3) [12]. A disadvantage of this

model is that the interaction between ith and jth particles can not be well-defined if there

exist two or more than two shortest geodesics which connect xi and xj. To prevent this

situation, the authors of [15] assumed the following a-priori condition:

"A shortest geodesic between two points xi(t) and xj(t) is unique for all i = j, t  0."
Actually, necessity of this a-priori condition comes from the structure of system (1.2). The shortest geodesic is special in this system, since the shortest geodesic between xi and xj is used to define an interaction between ith and jth particles. In this paper, we are interested in the following question:

·(Q): How can we remove the speciality of the shortest geodesic between xi and xj?

To remove the speciality of the shortest geodesic, we used all geodesics which connect xi and xj to define the interaction between ith and jth particles. We suggest a modified system on a manifold M as follows:

where xxik is a set of all geodesics which starts from xk and finish at xi, and Pik is a parallel transport from xk to xi along a geodesic . Here,  is a communication function depends on the length of a geodesic . Throughout this paper, we denote the universal covering space of M with the covering metric by M~ and p : M~  M is the corresponding covering map. We can lift this system onto the universal covering space M~ as follows:

where p-x~ 1 is a inverse map of p defined on neighborhood of x~ and u~yk~k := Dp-y~k1(vk) = Dp-y~k1  Dpx~k (v~k) and Px~y~ is a parallel transport from a tangent vector at y~ to a tangent

vector at x~. We assume the following two conditions to M :
(M1): A set p-1(x)  M~ is at most countable set for any x  M .
(M2): For any points x~, y~  M~ , there exists a unique geodesic which connects two points x~ and y~.

Here, (M1) is assumed for the well-definedness of sum y~kp-1(p(x~k)), and (M2) is assumed for the well-definedness of the parallel transport Px~iy~k . We provide more details about these assumptions in Section 4.1.
Now, we define the following energy functional

E [V ]

where

V

{vi}Ni=1.

Then

We

combine

this fact and Barbalat's lemma(Lemma 4.3) to obtain the long-time behavior of the system

as follows(See Theorem 4.1):

lim

If we lift this result to the universal covering space M~ , we have the follows(See Corollary 4.1):

lim

y~k p-1 (p(x~k ))

Since Px~iy~k u~yk~k can not be simplified on a general manifold M~ , we assume that M~ is the Euclidean space. Also, we simplify condition (1.3) on some specific manifolds(e.g. flat torus, flat M¨obius strip, and flat Klein bottle) in Section 5. On the flat torus, we could obtain the ordinary velocity alignment

under suitable conditions(see Section 5.1). Let the flat M¨obius strip and the flat Klein bottle constructed by the way introduced in Sections 5.2 and 5.3, respectively. Then, on the flat M¨obius strip and the flat Klein bottle, we could obtain the ordinary velocity alignment (1.4) and the second component of velocities vi converges for all 1  i  N (see Sections 5.2 and 5.3).

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the universal covering space and previous results of the Cucker-Smale(CS) model on manifolds. In Section 3, we modify the CS model on manifold on the flat torus Td. From this modification, we suggest the modified CS model on manifold on general manifold under some assumption in Section 4. We also study emergent behaviors of the modified CS model on some specific spaces(flat torus, flat M¨obius strip, flat Klein bottle) in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 is devoted to a brief summary of the paper.

Gallery of Notations. Now, we present some notations. Since we use the index set frequently, we define
N := {1, 2, · · · , N }. Also, for any vector x  Rd, we denote th component of x by (x).
i.e. x = ((x)1, (x)2, · · · , (x)d).

2. Preliminaries
In this section, we provide some preparatory concepts. Since the goal of this paper is to construct a velocity alignment model using universal covering spaces, we provide a simple review of universal covering spaces and prior studies on velocity alignment models.

2.1. Universal covering space of spaces of constant curvature. In this subsection, we provide a review on universal covering spaces of constant curvature space, since we will consider quotient spaces of the Euclidean space.

Theorem 2.1 (Theorem 4.1 of [11]). Let M be a d-dimensional complete Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature zero. Then the universal covering M~ of M , with the covering metric, is isometric to Rd.
Here, covering metric means that the covering map p : M~  M is a local isomorphism.

Corollary 2.1. From Theorem 2.1, we have the following results: (1) The universal covering space of the flat torus Td is Rd.
(2) The universal covering spaces of the flat Mo¨bius strip M and the flat Klein bottle K are R2.

2.2. The Cucker-Smale model on manifolds. In this subsection, we introduce the Cucker-Smale(CS) model on manifolds and its emergent behaviors. System (1.1) is a velocity alignment model on the Euclidean space introduced in [9]. It is natural that generalization of this system onto general manifolds. The authors of [15] suggested the CS model on general manifolds as system (1.2). Now, we present the previous results of system (1.2) on various spaces.

2.2.1. On the sphere Sd. The CS model (1.2) on sphere was first studied in [15]. In this paper, the authors assumed the following a-priori:

(2.5)

sup
0t<

max
i,jN

dist(xi(t),

xk (t))

<

.

This a priori assumption allows the well-posedness of the system on the sphere Sd. The authors of [2] improved these result. They assumed the following condition on the communication function :

(2.6)

dist(x, y) =  = (x, y) = 0.

The well-posedness of system (1.2) on the sphere can be broken when the parallel transport
Pik is not well defined, and this situation occurs when xi and xk are the antipodal points of each others for some i, k  N . However, if we impose condition (2.6), we do not have
to calculate Pikvk - vi since (xi, xk) is zero. One of the useful lemma to show a velocity alignment is Barbalat's lemma. We provide the lemma without the proof.

CS MODEL ON QUOTIENT SPACES

Lemma 2.1 (Barbalat's lemma [6]). Suppose that a real-valued function f : [0, )  R is uniformly continuous and it satisfies
t
lim f (s)ds exists.
t 0
Then, f tends to zero as t  . i.e. limt f (t) = 0.
Theorem 2.2 (Emergent behavior on the sphere [2]). Let {(xi, vi)}Ni=1 be a global smooth solution to (1.2) on the sphere Sd and assume that  : Sd×Sd  R is a positive smooth function satisfying (2.6). Then, we have the following dichotomy for the asymptotic dynamics of {(xi, vi)}Ni=1: (1) either the energy converges to zero:

lim E(t) = 0,
t

where E(t) =

N i=1

vi 2.

(2) or the energy converges to a nonzero positive value and all positions approach to a

common great circle asymptotically: for every i, j, k  N and a, b, c  {1, · · · , d + 1} we have

xai (t) xaj (t) xak(t)

lim E(t) > 0
t

and

lim
t

det

xbi (t) xci (t)

xbj (t) xcj (t)

xbk(t) = 0. xck (t)

2.2.2. On the hyperbolic space H2. The CS model on the hyperbolic space H2 was studied in [1]. For any x, y  H2, there exists the unique geodesic  which connects x and y. This
means, the parallel transport Pik between xi and xk is always well-defined. So, we do not need a condition which is similar to (2.6) in this case.

Theorem 2.3 (Emergent behavior on the hyperbolic space [1]). Let {(xi, vi)}Ni=1 be a global smooth solution to (1.2) on the hyperbolic space H2 and assume that  : H2 × H2  R is a
strictly positive smooth function. Then, we have the following dichotomy for the asymptotic dynamics of {(xi, vi)}Ni=1: (1) either the energy tends to zero:

lim E(t) = 0.
t
(2) or the energy converges to a positive value, and position configuration becomes coplanar asymptotically:

lim E(t) = E > 0
t

and

lim det
t

xi(t)

xj(t) xk(t) = 0

 i, j, k  N

where xi(t)  H2  R3 is considered as a three-dimensional vector for all i  N .

2.2.3. On the special orthogonal group SO(3). The CS model on SO(3) was studied in [12]. Instead of using {(xi, vi)}Ni=1, we use the pair {(Ri, Ai)}Ni=1 which satisfies

xi = Ri, vi = RiAi  i  N .

6

PARK

Here, Ri is an element of SO(3) and Ai is a skew symmetric matrix of size 3 × 3. Then, we can express system (1.2) on SO(3) as follows:

where

 0 -x3 x2  A =  x3 0 -x1  so(3).
-x2 x1 0

Theorem 2.4 (Emergent behavior on the special orthogonal group [12]). Let {(Ri, Ai)}Ni=1 be a solution to system (2.7). Then, we have the following dichotomy for the asymptotic dynamics of {(Ri, Ai)}Ni=1: (1) either the kinetic energy tends to zero:

lim E(t) = 0.
t
(2) or the energy converges to positive value E, and

tlim(Ai(t) - Ak(t)) = 0,  i, k  N . Also, particles approach and rotate with constant speed along a common geodesic.

Theorems 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 are results on the different manifolds, however, the common result is that the particles are aligned on to a common geodesic.

3. Velocity alignment models on the flat torus Td

A velocity alignment model on general manifolds was suggested in [15] and given as (1.2). If the following a-priori condition is guaranteed in system (1.2):
"A shortest geodesic between two points xi(t) and xj(t) is unique for all i = j, t  0,"
then the solution of the system is well-defined and unique. Since the system contains the parallel transport on the manifold, the a-priori condition should be assumed for the wellposedness. However, if the domain M has a cut locus(i.e. there exist at least two shortest geodesic between two points x, y  M ), then the system defined on M is not well-defined in general. Since we choose the shortest geodesic, we guess that singularities come from the speciality of the shortest geodesic. Regarding this reason, in this paper, we suggest a modified system which uses all geodesics to define the interactions. In this section, we suggest a modified velocity alignment model on the flat torus Td.

3.1. Geodesics on the flat torus. We are planning to consider all geodesics between xi, xj  M to define the interaction between ith and jth particles. So, in this subsection, we study the geodesics on the flat torus Td. We consider the flat torus Td as a quotient space of the Euclidean space
Td  Rd/,
where the equivalence relation  given as
[x1, x2, · · · , xd]  [x1 + n1, x2 + n2, · · · , xd + nd]  (n1, · · · , nd)  Zd.
Note that the metric of the torus was induced from Rd.

3.1.1. The case when d = 1. Before we study general dimension, we consider the simplest case. Since the universal covering space of T1 is R, we can define a covering map p as follows:

p : R  T1, x  x + Z.

Let x, y  T1 be two points on the one dimensional flat torus and  be a one of geodesic which connects two points x and y. Then there exists two points x~, y~  R such that  = p([x~, y~]). Now we will express the following set:

yx := {geodesics connecting x and y}.

From the previous argument, we can express the set of geodesics which connects x and y

as follows:

~ : [0, 1]  R1, ~(t) = x~ + t(y~ - x~),  = p  ~.

Since x~ and y~ are not unique, we can express all geodesics n with n  Z as follows: ~n : [0, 1]  R1, ~n(t) = x~ + t(y~ - x~ + n), n : [0, 1]  T1, n = p  ~n.
Then yx = {n}nZ is the set of geodesic from x to y.

Remark 3.1. From the above definition, we have the following properties.

(1) The length of n is given as

|n| = |y~ - x~ + n|. (2) Since R1/T1  Z, we can find a correspondence between yx and Z.

3.1.2. The general case d  2. Now we make some arguments on Td case. Recall that the universal covering of Td is Rd with the following covering map p:

p : Rd  Td, x  x + Zd.

From a similar argument that we made in the case of d = 1, we can express yx as follows:

yx = {n}nZd ,

where n  Zd and

(3.8)

~n : [0, 1]  Rd, ~n(t) = x~ + t(y~ - x~ + n), n : [0, 1]  Td, n = p  ~n.

Remark 3.2. From the above definition, we have the following properties. (1) The length of n with n  Zd is given as
|n| = y~ - x~ + n .

line segments are geodesic connecting the black point and white points.

(2) Since Rd/Td  Zd, we can find a correspondence between yx and Zd.

See Figure 1 for the case of d = 2, we express the geodesics of the flat torus on its universal covering space. We expressed all of the geodesics between x, y  M as follows:

(3.9)

yx = p([x~0, y~]) : for a fixed x~0  p-1(x) and for all y~  p-1(y) ,

where [x~0, y~] is a line segment on Rd which connects x~0 and y~. Now, we are ready to construct a modified model on the flat torus.

3.2. Construction of the modified model on the flat torus. Before we define a system on the flat torus, we define a system on its covering space Rd. Since we expressed the set
of geodesics between two points x, y as (3.9), we can construct a system which considers all
geodesics between two particles as follows:

t > 0,

where Px~iy~k is a parallel transport from a tangent vector at y~k to a tangent vector at x~k. Here, we assume that the sum y~kp-1(p(x~k)) is well-defined. We will discuss conditions for  in the last of this subsection. Since the flat torus has zero curvatures, the parallel
transport Px~iy~k is not necessary in this case. However, for a future generalization on general manifolds, we leave Px~iy~k . Now, we assume that (x, y) is a function of distRd(x, y) and define a function  : R0  R0 as follows:

(distRd(x, y)) = (x, y)  x, y  Td.

Now, we discuss conditions for the communication function  to guarantee the well-

posedness of system (3.10). Actually, it is equivalent to find a condition for the convergence

of  in (3.12). From the definition of  and Remark 3.2 (1), we have the following calculation:

(x, y) = (||) = ( y~ - x~ + n ).

Now we assume the following two conditions for :

(A1) A function  : R0  R0 is a continuous decreasing function.

(A2) A sum ( y~ - x~ + n ) converges.
nZd
Here, we assumed (A1), since  is a communication function. (A2) is assumed for the well-definedness of system (3.10) as we mentioned before. For a further argument, we provide the following lemma.

Lemma 3.1. Let x~, y~  Rd, then we have the following inequality:



min y~ - x~ + n  d .

Proof. From a simple calculation, we get

min y~ - x~ + n 2 = ((y~)1 - (x~)1 + (n)1)2 + · · · + ((y~)d - (x~)d + (n)d)2.

This is the desired result.

3.3. Condition of the communication functions . In this subsection, we study the condition for  which satisfies

(x, y) = ( y~ - x~ + n ) <   x, y  M.
nZd
Since  is continuous, non-negative and decreasing, we can apply the integral test on Rd to get

( y~ - x~ + n ) converges

From the radial symmetry, we have


(|x|)dx = |Sd-1| rd-1(r)dr,

So we can conclude that the condition (A1) and (A2) is equivalent to the following condition.

(A): A function  : R0  R0 is a continuous decreasing function and satisfies

rd-1(r)dr

exists.

Now, we study some examples of communication functions  which satisfy (A).

4. Velocity alignment models on general manifold

In this section, we generalize the result of Section 3 to a general manifold M .

We only have to concern about the well-definedness and the convergence of the sum xxik . Since arguing these issues on the universal covering space is easier, we lift system (4.16)

defined on M to a system on its universal covering space. We bring system (3.10) on general manifold as follows:

where p-x~ 1 is a inverse map of p defined on neighborhood of x~ and u~yk~k = Dp-y~k1(vk) = Dp-y~k1  Dpx~k (v~k) and Px~y~ is a parallel transport from a tangent vector at y~ to a tangent vector at x~. Since a sum y~kp-1(p(x~k)) should be well-defined, we assume the follows: (M1): A set p-1(x)  M~ is at most countable set for any x  M .

When M = Td, we have already showed that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between p-1(x) and Zd in Section 3.1. So, in this case, obviously p-1(x) is countable for
any x  Td. On the other hand, we know that Px~iy~k only depends on two points x~i and y~k. We should assume the following property of M~ :

(M2): For any points x~, y~  M~ , there exists a unique geodesic which connects two points x~ and y~.

If M~ is Euclidean space or has constant negative curvature(Hyperbolic space), then it
satisfies (M2). System (4.17) given on a manifold M is well defined for any M which satisfies (M1) and (M2). Especially, if M~ = Rd, then the parallel transport Px~iy~k in (4.17) can be omitted. In this case, analyzing system (4.17) is easier than analyzing system (4.16),
since we do not have to consider the parallel transport on M . In Section 5, we study some
examples of M (e.g. flat torus, flat M¨obius strip, and flat Klein bottle) which of the universal
covering space is the Euclidean spaces.

4.2. Reduction to the original CS model on manifold. In this section, we introduce

the relationship between system (4.16) and previous velocity alignment models. If we con-

sider that system (4.16) is defined on the Euclidean space(i.e. M = Rd), then there is the

unique geodesic  which connects two points x, y  M and its length is dist(x, y). So the set of geodesics yx only contains one element. This implies that system (4.16) can be reduced

to the original CS system (1.1).

Now, we compare two systems (1.2) and (4.16) given on T1. We define  which satisfies



1 2

= 0. If x, y  T1, then the length of geodesics are |y~ - x~ + n| for any n  Z. We know

that

there

are

at

most

one

such

that

|y~ - x~ + m|

<

1 2

.

This

implies

that

only

the

shortest geodesic between two points xi and xk determine the interaction between ith and

kth particles. i.e. system (4.16) can be reduced as follows:

i  N ,

where Pik is a parallel transport from the tangent space at xi to the tangent space at xk along shortest geodesic between them. This system is exactly same with system (1.2). So, we can conclude that a modified velocity alignment system (4.16) can be reduced to a previous system (1.2).

Remark 4.1. It is easy to show that the second temporal derivative of E(V) is bounded.

We combine Lemma 4.1 and Barbalat's lemma(Lemma ) to obtain the following theorem.

Theorem 4.1. Let (X , V) be a solution of system (4.16). Then we have

for any i, k  N .

From this theorem, we have the following corollary.

14

PARK

Corollary 4.1. Let (X~, V~) be a solution of system (4.17). Then we have

lim
t

(dist(x~i, y~k)) Px~iy~k u~yk~k - v~i 2 = 0,

y~k p-1 (p(x~k ))

where Px~iy~k u~yk~k is defined in (4.17).

Since given models (4.16) and (4.17) are defined on too general manifold M , we can not provide more specific emergent behaviors. In Section 5, we provide more specific emergent behaviors of system (4.16) and (4.17) on the specific manifold M .

4.4. Self-interaction effect. In a previous velocity alignment model on manifold (1.2), ith particle does not interact with itself, since Pii is the identity map and this yields Piivi -
vi = 0. However, system (4.16) is different. Since we considered all geodesics which is connecting xi and xj to define the interaction between ith and jth particles, if there exists non-trivial geodesic starts from xi and finish at xi then ith particle interacts with itself.
In this subsection, we focus on this effect. We put N = 1 and (x, v) := (x1, v1) to system
(4.16). Then we get

(4.18)

This yields

and from a simple fact of ODE, we know that if v0 = 0, then v(t) = 0 for all t  0. So we

can define u(t) for all t  0 as follows:

(4.20)

u(t) :=

v(t) v(t)

.

Now we substitute (4.20) into (4.19) to get

d v 2 = - v 2

(||) P  u - u 2

or equivalently,

d dt

(||) P  u - u 2.

From this, we can conclude that the self-interaction effect reduces the speed of particle, and

the ratio is at most exponential. If we apply Theorem 4.1 to system (4.18), then we get

(4.21)

lim v 2 (||) P  u - u 2 = 0.
t xx

CS MODEL ON QUOTIENT SPACES

Finally, we can obtain a dichotomy for the long-time behaviors of system (4.18): (1) The speed converges to zero. i.e.

lim v = 0.
t
(2) The direction of the velocity u satisfies

lim

(||) P  u - u 2 = 0.

This effect comes from the topology of the domain. This argument has not been argued before.

5. Systems on quotient spaces of the Euclidean space

In this section, we study system (4.16) on M which is quotient spaces of the Euclidean
space. We also assume that the universal covering space of M is the Euclidean space Rd. If we consider system (4.16) on its universal covering space M~ = Rd, then we have system (4.17). Since M~ = Rd, we can omit the parallel transport Px~iy~k in system (4.17). So we have

(5.22)

M~ d,

v~i(0) = v~i0  Tx~0i M~ ,

 i  N.

t > 0,

Here we use the original temporal derivative of v~i, since the domain is the Euclidean space. The only complicate thing in system (5.22) is calculating Dp-y~ 1  Dpx~ for x~, y~  p-1(x). In this section, we provide some specific spaces which are quotient spaces of the Euclidean

space(e.g. The flat torus, M¨obius strip, and the flat Klein bottle), and calculate the explicit form of Dp-y~ 1  Dpx~ to obtain more specific emergent behaviors of the modified velocity alignment system.

5.1. Example 1: The flat torus Td. We consider the flat torus Td in this subsection. We have already studied the covering map p between Rd and Td in Section 3.1 as follows:

p(x~) = ((x~)1 - [(x~)1], (x~)2 - [(x~)2], · · · , (x~)d - [(x~)d])  x~  Rd.

This yields that Dp-y~ 1  Dpx~ is the identity map. Also, we have already express the set of geodesics between x, y  Td as (3.8). From the above results, we can reduce system (5.22)
as follows:

(5.23)

x~i(0) = x~0i  Rd, v~i(0) = v~i0  Rd,  i  N .

t > 0,

Now, we apply Corollary 4.1, we can obtain the following theorem.

16

PARK

Proposition 5.1. Let (X , V) be a solution of system (4.16) defined on the flat torus Td.

Let  satisfies (A) and





d 2

> 0.

Then, we have

tlim(v~k - v~i) = 0  i, k  N . Proof. We apply Corollary 4.1 to system (5.23) to get

(5.24)

lim
t

(dist(x~i, x~k + n) v~k - v~i 2 = 0.

nZd

Since   0, we also have

(dist(x~i, x~k + n)  inf (dist(x~i, x~k + n)).
nZd nZd

Now we apply Lemma 3.1 to get



(dist(x~i, x~k + n)  

d 2

.

nZd

Now, we substitute the above relation into (5.24) to get





d 2

lim
t

v~k - v~i

2 = 0.



Since 

d 2

> 0, we get

lim
t

v~k - v~i

= 0.

Remark 5.1 (Self-interaction effect of the flat torus). Since P  is identity map for any closed curve , we have P v - v = 0 for any tangent vector v. So, relation (4.21) implies
nothing in this case. So we can conclude that there is no self-interaction effect on the flat
torus.

5.2. Example 2: The flat M¨obius strip M. We consider the flat M¨obius strip in this
subsection and denote it as M. We consider that M is given on [0, 1] × R  R2 with the identification (0, t)  (1, -t) where t  R. We can express the universal covering M~ = R2 with the following covering map p : M~  [0, 1) × R  M:

p(x~) = ((x~)1 - [(x~)1], (x~)2), if [(x~)1] is even,  x~  R2, ((x~)1 - [(x~)1], -(x~)2), if [(x~)1] is odd,

where [x] is the largest integer not greater than x  R. From the above covering map p, we

get

Dp-y~ 1  Dpx~(v~) =

((v~)1, (v~)2), ((v~)1, -(v~)2),

if [(y~)1] - [(x~)1] is even, if [(y~)1] - [(x~)1] is odd.

For the notation simplicity, we define the operator J as follows:

J(x~) = ((x~)1, -(x~)2)  x~  R2.

CS MODEL ON QUOTIENT SPACES

17

We also denote Jn be the n-th power of the operator J. Then, we can express p-1(p(x~)) as
follows: p-1(p(x~)) = {Jn(x~) + (n, 0) : n  Z}

and Dp-y~ 1  Dpx~(v~) = J n(v~)
if y~ = Jn(x~) + (n, 0) for some n  Z. Using these notations, we can reduce system (5.22) into

from the integral test. If we apply Corollary 4.1 to system (5.25), we get

(5.27)

lim

(dist(x~i, Jn(x~k) + (n, 0)) Jn(v~k) - v~i = 0.

nZ

Since J2 = Id, we have J2m+1 = J and J2m = Id for all integer m. From this fact, we get

(dist(x~i, J n(x~k) + (n, 0)) J n(v~k) - v~i 2

Lemma 5.1. Let p be a covering map between two dimensional the Euclidean space and the flat Mo¨bius strip. Let x, y  [0, 1] × R/  M and |x2|, |y2| < L for some positive number L. Then, we have

1 + 4L2,

inf dist(x~, J(y~) + (2m + 1, 0)) <

1 + 4L2,

18

Proof. First, we fix two points x, y  M and we choose x~, y~  R2 such that x~  p-1(x) and y~  p-1(y):
x~ = (x~1, x~2), y~ = (y~1, y~2).
Without loss of generality, we can assume that -1  x~1 - y~1 < 1. Then we have

dist(x~, y~ + (2m, 0))2 = (x~1 - y~1 - 2m)2 + (x~2 - y~2)2  (x~1 - y~1)2 + (x~2 - y~2)2.

Here, the last equality only holds for m = 0. Since -1  x~1-y~1 < 1 and -2L < x~2-y~2 < 2L, we have
inf dist(x~, y~ + (2m, 0))2 < 1 + 4L2.
mZ
Similarly, we have

inf dist(x~, J(y~) + (2m + 1, 0))2 = inf

mZ

mZ

(x~1 - y~1 - 2m - 1)2 + (x~2 + y~2)2

< 1 + 4L2.

From this lemma and (5.28), we get the following proposition.

Proposition 5.2. Let (X , V) be a solution of system (4.16) defined on M = M. If we assume the following a-priori assumption: "the second component of xi  [0, 1) × Rlies in (-L, L) for all t  0 and i  N ." We also assume that  satisfies (5.26) and ( 1 + 4L2) > 0. Then, we have
tlim(v~i - v~k) = 0  i, k  N ,
and the second components of all velocities converges to zero. i.e.

tlim(v~i)2 = 0 i  N .

Proof. From Lemma 5.1, we have

Here, we used the given a-priori assumption. We substitute (5.29) into (5.28) to obtain

t

v~k - v~i

(

1 + 4L2) lim

J (v~k) - v~i

Since ( 1 + 4L2) > 0, we have

(5.30)

lim

v~k - v~i

lim

J (v~k) - v~i

We consider the case when k = i of second equality for (5.30) to get

lim

J (v~i) - v~i

i  N .

From the definition of the operator J, we could obtain that the second component of v~i converges to zero.

Remark 5.2 (Self-interaction effect of the flat M¨obius strip). If we put xi = xk = x into (5.27), we get (4.21) on the Mo¨bius strip as follows:
lim (dist(x~, Jn(x~) + (n, 0))) Jn(v~) - v~ = 0.

If (1) = 0, then effect. However, if

mZ (dist(x~,J(x~) + (2m + 1, 0))) = 0 and there is we assume ( 1 + 4L2) > 0 and a-priori condition:

no self-interaction |x2| < L, then we

have

lim J(v~) - v~ = 0.
t

This also implies

tlim(v~)2 = 0. So, in this case, the self-interaction effect of the flat Mo¨bius strip yields that the second coordinate of the velocity converges to zero.

5.3. Example 3: The flat Klein bottle K. We consider the flat Klein bottle in this subsection and denote it as K. We consider that the K is given on [0, 1]2  R2 as Figure 2.

C = (0, 1)

B = (1, 1)

O = (0, 0)

A = (1, 0)

Figure 2. The flat Klein bottle K on R2

Here, two directed line segments OC and BA are identified as (0, t)  (1, 1 - t) and other
two directed line segments OA and CB are identified as (t, 0)  (t, 1) where 0  t  1. We can express the universal covering K~ of K on R2. Also, we can express the covering map p : K~ = R2  [0, 1)2  K as follows:

p(x~) = ((x~)1 - [(x~)1], (x~)2 - [(x~)2]), ((x~)1 - [(x~)1], -(x~)2 - [-(x~)2]),
From this, we get

if [(x~)1] is even, if [(x~)1] is odd,

x~  R2

Dp-y~ 1  Dpx~(v~) =

((v~)1, (v~)2), ((v~)1, -(v~)2),

if [(y~)1] - [(x~)1] is even, if [(y~)1] - [(x~)1] is odd.

Now, we use J defined in Section 5.2 to get p-1(p(x~)) = {Jnx~ + (n, m) : (n, m)  Z2}.
We also have that if y~ = Jn(x~) + (n, m) for some (n, m)  Z2, then Dp-y~ 1  Dpx~(v~) = J n(v~).
This notations allow us to simplify system (5.22) defined on M as follows:

Since the proof of the above lemma is similar to the proof of Lemmas 3.1 and Lemma 5.1, we omitted it. From this lemma, we have the following proposition.

tlim(v~i - v~k) = 0  i, k  N and the second component of v~i converges to zero. i.e.
tlim(v~i)2 = 0  i  N . Proof. From a similar argument that we used in the proof of Proposition 5.2, we can prove this proposition with (5.28) and Lemma 5.2

CS MODEL ON QUOTIENT SPACES

Remark 5.3 (Self-interaction effect of the flat Klein bottle). If we put xi = xk = x into (5.32), we get (4.21) on the flat Klein bottle as follows:

From a similar argument that we made in Remark 5.2, if (1) = 0, then there is no

self-interaction effect. However, if 

5 2

> 0, then the flat Klein bottle yields the self-

interaction effect which makes that the second coordinate of the velocity converges to zero.

6. Conclusion
Throughout this paper, we constructed a velocity alignment model on manifolds and studied the emergent dynamics in various spaces. Previously in [15], the CS model on manifold uses the shortest geodesic which connects two particles to define an interaction between them. One disadvantage of this model is that if there exist two or more than two shortest geodesics then the system can not be well-defined. We tried to remove the speciality of the shortest geodesic. So, we consider all of geodesics which is connecting ith particle and jth particle to define an interaction between ith and jth particles. In this way, we could obtain a modified velocity alignment system. One of the interesting properties of a modified system is the self-interaction effect. This effect depends on the structure of the domain of the system. In the last section, we provided the emergent behaviors of the modified system defined on some specific spaces(flat torus, flat M¨obius strip, flat Klein bottle). However, our model can not be applied on the sphere Sd with d  2. Since there are uncountably many geodesics that connecting antipodal pair points, we can not define the sum of interactions in this case. We need another setup to cover this case, and it can be nice future work.
