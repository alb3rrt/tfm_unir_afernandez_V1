The ballistic to diffusive crossover, that occurs when quasiparticles transport heat or charge, is important in small systems. Propagation of energy from an initial localized pulse provides a useful picture of the process. This paper looks at the simplest example, vibrational pulses on a onedimensional harmonic chain of atoms. Pure ballistic propagation occurs in ordered chains, and a crossover toward diffusive propagation can be seen in disordered chains. A full analysis is inhibited by non-perturbative effects, especially Anderson localization. A partial analysis using Boltzmann theory is given.

I. INTRODUCTION

In nonmagnetic insulators, phonons are the carriers of heat. Phonons have diverse mean free paths Q, diverging at small wavevector |q| (the mode index Q means (q, j), where j is the branch index). The standard (local)
Fourier law J = -T is not obeyed at locations (e.g. near boundaries) where local temperature T (r) varies on a length scale less than mean free paths of relevant phonons. Issues related to this (often called the "ballistic to diffusive crossover") are important in nanoscale devices. There aren't yet unifying theories, or prototype examples with detailed mathematical analysis. Numerical study of pulse propagation1 provides simple insights but has not been used often. This paper looks at pulses on a one-dimensional harmonic chain, the simplest possible example2, and gives a partial analysis.
A generalized Fourier law, with a nonlocal conductivity (r, r ; t, t ) relating current at r, t to temperature gradient at other places and earlier times r , t , does not fully describe the problem. Hua and Lindsay3 have recently shown that, in Boltzmann theory with external driving, there is an extra term,

t

J(r, t) = - dr

dt (r - r , t - t )T (r , t )

-

+B(r, t)

(1)

This equation applies when the medium is spatially homogeneous, but driven by a space and time-dependent
external power insertion PQ(r, t). The extra term B varies with the Q-dependence of the inserted power. A similar term was found by Guyer and Krumhansl4. It is disappointing that a unique non-local response function
((k, ) in reciprocal space) is insufficient and must be

supplemented by a non-unique term B. Allen and Perebeinos5 introduced a related but simpler
response function,

t

T (r, t) = dr

dt (r - r , t - t )P (r , t )

-

+C(r, t).

(2)

Here P is the mode average Q(CQ/C)PQ, with the specific heat C(T0) = Q CQ(T0). This connects the tem-

perature rise T = T (r, t) - T0 to the power inserted at other places and earlier times (r , t ). Similar to B(r, t) in Eq. 1, the extra term C(r, t) was not noticed until recently6. The version in ref. 5 did not take into account that the mathematical pulse form P could vary strongly with vibrational mode Q, For power insertion P (r, t) identical for each mode Q, the extra terms B(r, t) and C(r, t) vanish in Eqs. 1 and 2.
The name for the response function  was originally "thermal susceptibility", indicating a similarity to the electrical susceptibility relating charge to potential in a metal. However, the term "thermal susceptibility" is used with different meanings7,8, so a less confusing name, "thermal distributor", is now used6. Focusing on the scalar response T to the scalar perturbation P has advantages; it is closer to the targets of nanoscale measurement9 than the relation of the vector J to the vector T . Pulses are a good way to investigate this response. When P describes a pulse, it has (r, t)dependence that, in the continuum limit, is  (r)(t).
The temperature response T (k, ) thus contains a pic-
ture of the response function (k, ). The two response functions5 are related by

FIG. 1. Circles connected by solid lines are the computed local energy Ea( ) at t = 30 for three types of pulses (see Eq. 6 and Table I). All three pulses evolve from energy inserted at t = 0 and x  0 into a harmonic chain. The D and V2 pulses are initiated on atoms 0 and 1, but their positions on the horizontal axis are shifted by -1/2 to make them symmetric around x = 0. The dashed curves are models derived from a continuum picture, such as Boltzmann theory, and given in Eqs. 13, 14, 15.

There are 2N free parameters (amplitude AQ  0 and phase Q for each normal mode Q.) Their frequencies are Q = max| sin(Qa/2)| and group velocities are vQ = vmax cos(Qa/2)sign(Q). The maximum frequency and
velocity are max = 2 (K/M ) and vmax = a (K/M ). Dimensionless units K = M = a = 1 are used. Fig 1 shows three different pulses (labeled D, V2, and V1) after propagating for t = 30 (the unit of time is 2/max = 1).
The local energy E( , t) at atom , plotted in Fig. 1, is defined as

P2 K Ea( ) = 2M + 4

(u -1 - u )2 + (u

- u +1)2

.

(6)

Each atom is assigned its own kinetic energy, and half of the potential energy of the springs to its left and right. This is the common definition, but it is not unique. Two other (randomly chosen but sensible) choices, for distributing potential energy to different sites, are

P2 K Eb( ) = 2M + 2

(2u2 - u (u -1 + u +1) ,

FIG. 2. The harmonic V2 pulse at temperature T = 0 and time t = 30, using three ways (Eqs. 6-8) of assigning potential energy to a local site energy, E( ). In (a) and (b), the total enegy is E = E( ). The area under the curves is E, chosen to be 1. In (c), however, the energy has an extra part E( + 1/2). The values in the graph have been arbitrarily doubled so that the total energy, also 1, is the area under the graph. These graphs demonstrate that the "continuum picture" of energy density (the dashed curves in Fig. 1) is more sensible than these local pictures.

The conventional version Ea will be used in this paper, but it is interesting to see how it compares with versions Eb and Ec, as shown in fig. 2. The large oscillations seen in version (c) are surprising, and the smoothness seen in version (b) is even more surprising. This diversity suggests that a continuum definition of local energy may be more physical than a local version. Ambiguity also exists in quantum treatments. Marcolongo et al.10 and Ercole et al11 have shown how this ambiguity does not affect the computation of bulk transport.
The definitions of the three types of pulses of Fig. 1 are given in Table I. The "V1" (or "velocity") pulse has only the central atom given a velocity v0 at t = 0. The "V2" (or "dual velocity") pulse has two central atoms given equal and opposite velocities. The "D" (or "displacement") pulse has two central atoms given equal and opposite displacements at t = 0.
Figure 1 shows Ea( , t) at t = 30 for the three types of pulses, inserted at t = 0 into zero-temperature (i.e. stationary) chains. Figure 3 shows the same pulse forms, at t = 20, inserted into chains with a pre-existing thermal distribution of velocities and displacements. In T > 0 cases, the initial pulse amplitudes (u0,1 or v0,1) are scaled from those in table I to make the total extra energy
Ea( ) of all pulses of the ensemble equal to 1. The pulse profiles in Figs. 1 and 3 were computed in two

The local energies Ea( ) shown in the graphs are the differences between Ea( , t = 20) with and without pulse insertion. The first graph shows D pulses inserted with two typical initial conditions. The other graphs show, in red, the results averaged over 1000-member ensembles with random thermal initial
conditions. The black results repeat the zero-temperature pulses shown in Fig. 1. The finite T pulse shapes, after ensemble
averaging, are converging towards the zero-temperature pulse shapes.

For the T = 0 case, values of AQ and Q are given in table II. They are derived from the t = 0+ positions and velocities shown in table I at t = 0.
The chains are harmonic, so the pulses propagate ballistically. The leading edges propagate at the velocity of sound, ±vmax. The left or right parts have root mean

The rms displacements propagate at slower speeds. Values vrms = dx¯/dt  ±vmax/ n, with n = 2, 4, 6 for the V1, V2, and D pulses, respectively, follow from the continuum description described next.

Using values of AQ from Table II, the mode energies are also shown in Table II. The continuum version is ignorant of specific atomic coordinates, and finds an alternate definition of the local energy density E(x, t). An appropriate continuum hypothesis for a pulse originating at

(x, t) = (0, 0) is

E(x, t) = E(Q)(x - vQt).

The total energy dxE(x, t) is E0 in all three cases. These formulas are shown as dashed lines in Figs. 1 and

3. The continuum model agrees well with an average of

nearby values of the local atomic energy E( ) for all of

the three versions E( ). The rms centers of energy of the propagating pulses are then

(16)

 This is where the result dx¯/dt  ±vmax/ n (with n = 2, 4, 6) came from.
It had been our original guess that when the pulse propagates in a thermal background, the fine structure in E( ) would disappear and the result would resemble the continuum version E(x). The computation in Fig. 3 shows that this guess was wrong. The fine structure remains. A proof that this should happen is given in the appendix.

III. BOLTZMANN EQUATION

The formulas given in Eqs. 13, 14, 15 came from a sensible hypothesis, Eq. 12. Re-deriving this from Boltzmann theory gives useful insight. The Peierls Boltzmann equation uses quantum wave/particle duality to deal with phonons as a gas of particles, which can be treated classically or quantum mechanically.

(17)

The function NQ(x, t) is the occupancy per unit length of phonon mode Q at (x, t). The spatial sum
dxNQ(x, t) = NQ(t) is the mode occupancy. Even though our treatment of the linear chain is classical, it is sensible to use the quantum version, with an equilibrium

distribution NQ  nQ(T0) = [exp( Q/kBT0) - 1]-1 rather than the classical limit nQ = kBT0/ Q.
The scattering (or collision) term (NQ/t)coll, is dropped, because the perfect harmonic linear chain has
phonon modes Q that never decay. The chains are driven
by an external manipulation that changes the Newto-
nian state {u , v } to {u + u , v + v }. This al-
ters phonon amplitudes and phases to give the start-
ing pulse shape. This needs to be accomplished by the
term (NQ/t)ext in the Boltzmann equation. External driving (NQ/t)ext has only recently appeared in phonon Boltzmann theory12­15, and its form and signif-
icance are not yet fully understood. Boltzmann theory
does not deal directly with amplitudes AQ. These are indirectly included via the mode energy M A2QQ2 /2 
QNQ. Boltzmann theory does not deal at all with phases Q. The external term (NQ/t)ext drives the distribution function NQ away from equilibrium nQ(T0) to nQ(T0)+Q(x, t). Linearizing in Q, the driving term has the form

NQ

E(Q)

=

(x)(t).

(18)

Q

The energy inserted by the pulse into mode Q is Q × NQ, where NQ = dx dt(NQ(x, t)/t)ext. The total pulse energy given to the system is clearly correct:

EpBuollstezmann =

E(Q).

The  here allows the finite T distribution to be nQ(T0)+ NQ, and is not needed at T = 0 where nQ = 0. The local energy density is

E¯pulse(x, t) =

QNQ(x, t) = E(Q)(x-vQt).

(22)

This agrees exactly with Eq. 12. These results improve

confidence in the new insertion term added to the Peierls

Boltzmann equation. We also learn that, in the contin-

uum description, the pulse shapes (Eqs. 13-15) are inde-

pendent of T , because the temperature T0 in the Boltzmann treatment did not have to be specified. The less

obvious result, that pulse shapes in the atomistic version

are also independent of T , is shown in the Appendix.

IV. MASS DISORDER
Disorder adds interesting complications to 1-d harmonic crystals. Disorder causes Anderson localization of all single-particle electron eigenstates, in disordered metals of dimension 2 or less16. Localization of phonons is similar17­19. All phonon normal modes on a 1-d disordered chain are localized if the chain is long enough. Quasiparticle theory and perturbation theory do not work at long distances in d = 1, but at intermediate distances, if disorder is not too great, are likely to be useful. Reference 2 gives the example of a wave packet progating on a weakly mass-disordered chain. Ballistic propagation is seen at short distances and times, diffusive propagation at intermediate ones, and Anderson localization at long distances and times.
A problem is immediately obvious when using the Fermi golden rule for phonon decay rates, 1/Q = (2/ ) Q |VQQ |2( Q - Q ). The interaction VQQ can contain either mass or spring-constant disorder. Second order perturbation theory can never drive the phonon gas to redistribute energies of normal modes to a thermal distribution, since scattering conserves the number of phonons with energy Q. In higher order, pairs of phonons of energy 1 + 2 can scatter to other pairs 3 + 4 with the same total energy, and thus evolve toward equilibrium. But at long times, Anderson localization, a non-perturbative effect, prohibits use of perturbative treatments. Boltzmann theory usually uses only second-order scattering, so seems hard to apply to the ballistic to diffusive crossover, and is not applicable to the diffusive to localized crossover.
We now use mass defects to see how they weaken ballistic propagation. We randomly choose 10% of the atoms, and increase their masses from M = 1 to M = 1.5. Results at various times for a D pulse are shown in Fig. 4. The lattice is still harmonic, but the Hamiltonian is no longer diagonal in the plane-wave basis, Eq. 5. Before ensemble averaging, the pulse shape varies depending on the locations of the mass defects relative to the point of pulse insertion. The D-pulse shapes of Fig. 4 have been averaged over 100 different random placements of the altered masses.
The pulse shape at t = 10 M/K is not much altered from pure ballistic behavior. The pulse has propagated only a distance of ±10 atoms, and encountered typically only two impurities. As time proceeds, there is increasing deviation from the ballistic line shape predicted in Eq. 15, and shown in the red curves. By t=40, the fraction of the energy in the leading ballistic edge is noticeably diminished, and the fraction in the interior ±10 atoms has failed to diminish the way ballistic propagation does. Diffusion is increasingly taking over. The disorder is relatively weak, so the Anderson localization lengths Q are probably mostly longer than the propagation distance of ±40 atoms studied here.
Even though a Boltzmann analysis is both questionable and more difficult than we wish to attempt, one

might still wonder whether Boltzmann theory in relaxation time approximation (RTA) could be used. If the term (NQ/t)coll,RTA = -Q/Q is added to Eq. 17, the solution is the same as Eq. 21 except that the infinitesimal  is replaced by 1/Q. The result is clearly inappropriate: Eq. 22 acquires a factor exp(-t/Q). This may offer a sensible description of the decay of ballistic propagation, but offers no hint of the desired diffusion. It just destroys the ballistic energy without replacing it. It is surprising how inapplicable RTA is to this (x, t)dependent case, considering how successful it is in bulk time-independent quasiparticle conductivity  of many materials.
Here is a sensible phenomenological guess for how the ballistic/diffusive crossover might happen.

Equation 24 is the RTA solution. Equation 25 is a guess

with no precise Boltzmann origin. The quantity DQ  vQ2 Q is the mode diffusivity. The sum of Eqs. 24 and
25 has been forced to conserve mode energy. The rate

1/Q is the lifetime broadening of state Q caused by mass defects. To second order, the formula20,21 is

This hypothesis is tested in Fig. 5, with no adjustable parameters. The fit is not impressive, but is a sensible caricature of what is happening. The disagreement between hypothesis and numerical computation does not look like it could be caused by localization. It might be explainable by a Boltzmann treatment using higher-order scattering terms.

quantum response (the phase point p(t) = {u (t), v (t)} or the wave function (p, t)) are washed out. The local energy is not well-defined at the atomic level, as has been shown in fig. 2. The continuum picture cures this at the expense of omitting atomic details. The continuum picture can be analyzed by Boltzmann theory, if quasiparticles are a good approximation. Such a Boltzmann description requires a term containing the external driving. The driving term needs the energy E(Q) inserted externally into each mode.
For at least 60 years4,22 there have been developments of Boltzmann theory aimed at studying systems driven at small distance scales, i.e. distances comparable to quasiparticle mean free paths. These developments are not finished. External driving was first included 5 years ago12­15. The accepted form is

The facor C/V CQ is then N/V , arising from the fact that the Boltzmann equation 17 uses NQ(x, t) as the occupation number density, while the usual Boltzmann equation describes occupation number. The present version agrees with the usual version in the classical limit, where PQ(r, t)  (1/a)E(Q)(x)(t). It also sheds light on the diversity of forms that the external power insertion PQ can take. And our classical calculations illustrate that pulse profiles vary significantly depending on details of the initial pulse makeup.
Study of pulse profiles clarifies aspects of nanoscale transport. They are more easily analyzed than most

7

nanoscale problems because the pulse can exist in an infinite homogeneous medium with no need for difficult bounary conditions.

after.

Using Eq.

35, this can be written as

Eµbefore = [fµ + igµv0][fµ - igµv0] Eµafter = [fµ + igµ(v0 + v0)][fµ - igµ(v0 + v0)], (37)

where

fµ =

1 =0 2N

M (µu + iv )µ +

M0µu0µ0 (38)

and gµ =

M0 2N

µ0.

(39)

The point of Eq. 37 is to separate the coordinate v0 or v0 + v0 from the remaining coordinates u , v which are collected in fµ. This enables ensemble averages to be done using the fact that fµv0 T = fµ T v0 T = 0 and fµv0 T = fµ T v0 T = 0. The null values follow from the fact that fµ T = 0. Note that v0 T = 0; v0 is chosen to make the V1 pulse have a fixed energy Epulse, for every member of the ensemble. This requires

whether ensemble-averaged or not. This is the general version of the T = 0 form in Eq. 36 which has v0 = 0. From Eq. 37 we get

EµV1 = gµ2 [(v0 + v0)2 - v02] - i(fµ - fµ)gµv0. (41)

The ensemble average is

EµV1 T = gµ2 [(v0 + v0)2 - v02] T .

(42)

Finally, using Eqs. 36, 39, and 40, we get

This proof is sufficiently tedious that the corresponding proofs for V2 and D pulses have not been checked. The

results of Fig. 3 indicate that probably all pulses on harmonic chains have shapes independent of T after ensemble averaging.
