## Abstract

In this paper, we have studied the dynamical aspects of some cosmological models in an isotropic space-time within the framework of an extended gravity theory. Two accelerating cosmological models are presented with quasi-de Sitter (QDS) and linear combination of exponential (LCE) scale factors. The geometrical testing mechanism has been performed and analysed. While the results of the QDS model show a departure from the concordant $\Lambda$CDM model, the resulting behavior of the LCE model seems to be compatible with the $\Lambda$CDM model only at the present epoch and is incompatible in the near past.
