## Abstract

While the family of layered pnictides $ABX_2$ ($A$ : rare or alkaline earth metals, $B$ : transition metals, $X$ : Sb/Bi) can host Dirac dispersions based on Sb/Bi square nets, nearly half of them has not been synthesized yet for possible combinations of the $A$ and $B$ cations. Here we report the fabrication of EuCdSb$_{\mathrm{2}}$ with the largest $B$-site ionic radius, which is stabilized for the first time in thin film form by molecular beam deposition. EuCdSb$_{\mathrm{2}}$ crystallizes in an orthorhombic $Pnma$ structure and exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering of the Eu magnetic moments at $T_\mathrm{N}=15$K. Our successful growth will be an important step for further exploring novel Dirac materials using film techniques.
