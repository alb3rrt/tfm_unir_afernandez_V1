Abstract
In this paper, we introduce and study the S-weak global dimension S-w.gl.dim(R) of a commutative ring R for some multiplicative subset S of R. Moreover, commutative rings with S-weak global dimension at most 1 are studied. Finally, we investigated the S-weak global dimension of factor rings and polynomial rings. Key Words: S-flat modules, S-flat dimensions, S-weak global dimensions. 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification: 13D05, 13D07, 13B25.
Throughout this article, R always is a commutative ring with unity 1 and S always is a multiplicative subset of R, that is, 1  S and s1s2  S for any s1  S, s2  S. In 2002, Anderson and Dumitrescu [1] defined S-Noetherian rings R for which any ideal of R is S-finite. Recall from [1] that an R-module M is called S-finite provided that sM  F for some s  S and some finitely generated submodule F of M. An R-module T is called uniformly S-torsion if sT = 0 for some s  S in [11]. So an R-module M is S-finite if and only if M/F is uniformly S-torsion for some finitely generated submodule F of M. The idea derived from uniformly S-torsion modules is deserved to be further investigated. In [11], the author of this paper introduced the class of S-flat modules F for which the functor F R - preserves S-exact sequences. The class of S-flat modules can be seen as a "uniform" generalization of that of flat modules, since an R-module F is S-flat if and only if TorR1 (F, M) is uniformly S-torsion for any R-module M (see [11, Theorem 3.2]). The class of S-flat modules owns the following S-hereditary property: let 0  A -f B -g C  0 be an S-exact sequence, if B and C are S-flat so is A (see [11, Proposition 3.4]). So it is worth to study the S-analogue of flat dimensions of R-modules and S-analogue of weak global dimension of commutative rings.
In this article, we define the S-flat dimension S-f dR(M) of an R-module M to be the length of the shortest S-flat S-resolution of M. We characterize S-flat dimensions of R-modules using the uniform torsion property of the "Tor" functors in Proposition 3.2. Besides, we obtain a new local characterization of flat dimensions

of R-modules (see Corollary 3.7). The S-weak global dimension S-w.gl.dim(R) of a commutative ring R is defined to be the supremum of S-flat dimensions of all R-modules. A characterization of S-weak global dimensions is given in Proposition 3.2. Examples of rings R for which S-w.gl.dim(R) =w.gl.dim(RS) can be found in Example 3.11. S-von Neumann regular rings are firstly introduced in [11] for which there exists s  S such that for any a  R there exists r  R such that sa = ra2. By [11, Theorem 3.11], a ring R is S-von Neumann regular if and only if all R-modules are S-flat. So S-von Neumann regular rings are exactly commutative rings with S-weak global dimension equal to 0 (see Corollary 3.8). We also study commutative rings R with S-w.gl.dim(R) at most 1. The nontrivial example of commutative rings with S-w.gl.dim(R)  1 but infinite weak global dimension is given in Example 3.11. In the final section, we investigate the S-weak global dimensions of factor rings and polynomial rings and show that S-w.gl.dim(R[x]) = S-w.gl.dim(R)+1 (see Theorem 4.7).

1. Preliminaries

Recall from [11], an R-module T is called a uniformly S-torsion module provided that there exists an element s  S such that sT = 0. An R-sequence M -f N -g L
is called S-exact (at N) provided that there is an element s  S such that sKer(g)  Im(f ) and sIm(f )  Ker(g). We say a long R-sequence ...  An-1 -fn An -f-n+1 An+1  ... is S-exact, if for any n there is an element s  S such that sKer(fn+1)  Im(fn) and sIm(fn)  Ker(fn+1). An S-exact sequence 0  A  B  C  0 is called a short S-exact sequence. An R-homomorphism f : M  N is an Smonomorphism (resp., S-epimorphism, S-isomorphism) provided 0  M -f N (resp., M -f N  0, 0  M -f N  0 ) is S-exact. It is easy to verify an
R-homomorphism f : M  N is an S-monomorphism (resp., S-epimorphism, S-
isomorphism) if and only if Ker(f ) (resp., Coker(f ), both Ker(f ) and Coker(f )) is
a uniformly S-torsion module.

Proposition 1.1. Let R be a ring and S a multiplicative subset of R. Suppose there is an S-isomorphism f : M  N for R-modules M and N. Then there is an S-isomorphism g : N  M.

Proof. Consider the following commutative diagram:

0

// Ker(f )

// M
"" ""

f

 .

// <<

N

// Coker(f )

// 0

Im(f )

2

with sKer(f ) = 0 and sN  Im(f ) for some s  S. Define g1 : N  Im(f ) where g1(n) = sn for any n  N . Then g1 is a well-defined R-homomorphism since sn  Im(f ). Define g2 : Im(f )  M where g2(f (m)) = sm. Then g2 is well-defined R-homomorphism. Indeed, if f (m) = 0, then m  Ker(f ) and so
sm = 0. Set g = g2  g1 : N  M. We claim that g is an S-isomorphism. Indeed, let n be an element in Ker(g). Then sn = g1(n)  Ker(g2). Note that sKer(g2) = 0. Thus s2n = 0. So s2Ker(g) = 0. On the other hand, let m  M. Then g(f (m)) = g2  g1(f (m)) = g2(f (sm)) = s2m. Thus s2m  Im(g). So s2M  Im(g). It follows that g is an S-isomorphism.

Remark 1.2. Let R be a ring, S a multiplicative subset of R and M and N Rmodules. Then the condition "there is an R-homomorphism f : M  N such that fS : MS  NS is an isomorphism" does not mean "there is an R-homomorphism g : N  M such that gS : NS  MS is an isomorphism".
Indeed, let R = Z be the ring of integers, S = R - {0} and Q the quotient field of integers. Then the embedding map f : Z  Q satisfies fS : Q  Q is an isomorphism. However, since HomZ(Q, Z) = 0, there does not exist any Rhomomorphism g : Q  Z such that gS : Q  Q is an isomorphism.
Let R be a ring and S a multiplicative subset of R. Suppose M and N are Rmodules. We say M is S-isomorphic to N if there exists an S-isomorphism f : M  N. A family C of R-modules is said to be closed under S-isomorphisms if M is Sisomorphic to N and M is in C, then N is also in C. It follows from Proposition 1.1 that the existence of S-isomorphisms of two R-modules is an equivalence relation. Next, we give an S-analogue of Five Lemma.

Theorem 1.3. (S-analogue of Five Lemma) Let R be a ring, S a multiplicative subset of R. Consider the following diagram with S-exact rows:

A g1 // B g2 // C g3 // D g4 // E

fA

fB

fC

fD

fE


A

h1

//


B

h2

//


C

h3

//


D

h4

//


E.

(1) If fB and fD are S-monomorphisms and fA is an S-epimorphism, then fC is an S-monomorphism.
(2) If fB and fD are S-epimorphisms and fE is an S-monomorphism, then fC is an S-epimorphism.
(3) If fA is an S-epimorphism, fE is an S-monomorphism, and fB and fD are S-isomorphisms, then fC is an S-isomorphism.
(4) If fA, fB, fD and fE are all S-isomorphisms, then fC is an S-isomorphism.

Proof. (1) Let x  Ker(fC). Then fDg3(x) = h3fC (x) = 0. Since fD is an Smonomorphism, s1Ker(fD) = 0 for some s1  S. So s1g3(x) = g3(s1x) = 0. Since the top row is S-exact, there exists s2  S such that s2Ker(g3)  Im(g2). Thus there exists b  B such that g2(b) = s2s1x. Hence h2fB(b) = fCg2(b) = fC(s2s1x) = 0. Thus there exists s3  S such that s3Ker(h2)  Im(h1). So there exists a  A such that h1(a) = s2fB(b). Since fA is an S-epimorphism, there exists s4  S such that s4A  Im(fA). So there there exists a  A such that s4a = fA(a). Hence s4s2fB(b) = s4h1(a) = h1(fA(a)) = fB(g1(a)). So s4s2b - g1(a)  Ker(fB). Since fB is an S-monomorphism, there exists s5  S such that s5Ker(fB) = 0. Thus s5(s4s2b - g1(a)) = 0. So s5s4s2s2s1x = s5(g2(s4s2b)) = s5g2(g1(a)). Since the top row is S-exact at B, then there exists s6  S such that s6Im(g1)  Ker(g2). So s6s5s4s2s2s1x = s5g2(s6g1(a)) = 0. Consequently, if we set s = s6s5s4s2s2s1, then sKer(fC) = 0. It follows that fC is an S-monomorphism.
(2) Let x  C. Since fD is an S-epimorphism, then there exists s1  S such that s1D  Im(fD). Thus there exists d  D such that fD(d) = s1h3(x). By the commutativity of the right square, we have fEg4(d) = h4fD(d) = s1h4(h3(x)). Since the bottom row is S-exact at D, there exists s2  S such that s4Im(h3)  Ker(h4). So s4fE(g4(d)) = s1h4(s4h3(x)) = 0. Since fE is an S-monomorphism, there exists s3  S such that s3Ker(fE) = 0. Thus s3s4g4(d) = 0. Since the top row is Sexact at D, there there exists s5  S such that s5Ker(g4)  Im(g3). So there exists c  C such that s5s3s4d = g3(c). Hence s5s3s4fD(d) = fD(g3(c)) = h3(fC(c)). Since s5s3s4fD(d) = h3(s1s5s3s4x), we have fC(c) - s1s5s3s4x  Ker(h3). Since the bottom row is S-exact at C, there exists s6  S such that s6Ker(h3)  Im(h2). Thus there exists b  B such that s6(fC(c) - s1s5s3s4x) = h2(b). Since fB is an Sepimorphism, then there exists s7  S such that s7B  Im(fB). So s7b = fB(b) for some b  B. Thus fC (g2(b)) = h2(fB(b)) = s7h2(b) = s7(s6(fC (c) - s1s5s3s4x)). So s7s6s1s5s3s4x = s7s6fC(c)-fC(g2(b)) = fC(s7s6c-g2(b))  Im(fC ). Consequently, if we set s = s7s6s1s5s3s4, then sC  Im(fC ). It follows that fC is an S-epimorphism.
It is easy to see (3) follows from (1) and (2), while (4) follows from (3).
Recall from [11, Definition 3.1] that an R-module F is called S-flat provided that for any S-exact sequence 0  A  B  C  0, the induced sequence 0  A R F  B R F  C R F  0 is S-exact. It is easy to verify that the class of S-flat modules is closed under S-isomorphisms by the following result.
Lemma 1.4. [11, Theorem 3.2] Let R be a ring, S a multiplicative subset of R and F an R-module. The following assertions are equivalent:
(1) F is S-flat;
4

(2) for any short exact sequence 0  A -f B -g C  0, the induced sequence 0  A R F -f--RF B R F -g--RF C R F  0 is S-exact;
(3) TorR1 (M, F ) is uniformly S-torsion for any R-module M; (4) TorRn (M, F ) is uniformly S-torsion for any R-module M and n  1.
The following result says that a short S-exact sequence induces a long S-exact sequence by the functor "Tor" as the classical case.
Theorem 1.5. Let R be a ring, S a multiplicative subset of R and N an R-module. Suppose 0  A -f B -g C  0 is an S-exact sequence of R-modules. Then for any n  1 there is an R-homomorphism n : TorRn (C, N )  TorRn-1(A, N ) such that the induced sequence
...  TorRn (A, N )  TorRn (B, N )  TorRn (C, N ) -n TorRn-1(A, N ) 
TorRn-1(B, N )  ...  TorR1 (C, N ) -1 A R N  B R N  C R N  0 is S-exact.
Proof. Since the sequence 0  A -f B -g C  0 is S-exact at B. There are three exact sequences 0  Ker(f ) -iK-e-r(f) A --Im-(f) Im(f )  0, 0  Ker(g) -iK-e-r(g) B --Im-(g) Im(g)  0 and 0  Im(g) -i-Im-(g) C --C-ok-er-(g) Coker(g)  0 with Ker(f ) and Coker(g) uniformly S-torsion. There also exists s  S such that sKer(g)  Im(f ) and sIm(f )  Ker(g). Denote T = Ker(f ) and T  = Coker(g).
Firstly, consider the exact sequence
TorRn+1(T , N )  TorRn (Im(g), N ) -T-or-Rn-(i-Im-(-g)-,N) TorRn (C, N )  TorRn (T , N ).
Since T  is uniformly S-torsion, TorRn+1(T , N ) and TorRn (T , N ) is uniformly Storsion. Thus TorRn (iIm(g), N ) is an S-isomorphism. So there is also an S-isomorphism hnIm(g) : TorRn (C, N )  TorRn (Im(g), N ) by Proposition 1.1. Consider the exact sequence:
TorRn-1(T, N )  TorRn-1(A, N ) -T-o-rRn---1(--Im-(f-),-N) TorRn-1(Im(f ), N )  TorRn-2(T, N ).
Since T is uniformly S-torsion, we have TorRn-1(Im(f), N ) is an S-isomorphism. So there is also an S-isomorphism hInm-(1f) : TorRn-1(Im(f ), N )  TorRn-1(A, N ) by Proposition 1.1. We have two exact sequences
TorRn+1(T1, N )  TorRn (sKer(g), N ) -T-or-Rn-(i-1sK-e-r(-g)-,N) TorRn (Im(f ), N )  TorRn+1(T1, N )
and TorRn+1(T2, N )  TorRn (sKer(g), N ) -T-or-Rn-(i-2sK-e-r(-g)-,N) TorRn (Ker(g), N )  TorRn+1(T2, N ),
5

where T1 = Im(f )/sKer(g) and T2 = Im(f )/sIm(f ) is uniformly S-torsion. So TorRn (i1sKer(g), N ) and TorRn (i2sKer(g), N ) are S-isomorphisms. Thus there is an Sisomorphisms hnsKer(g) : TorRn (Ker(g), N )  TorRn (sKer(g), N ). Note that there is an exact sequence TorRn (B, N ) -T-o-rRn-(-I-m-(g-),-N) TorRn (Im(g), N ) --Inm-(g) TorRn-1(Ker(g), N ) -T-o-rRn---1(-iK-e-r(g-),-N) TorRn-1(B, N ). Set n = hnIm(g)  Inm(g)  hnsKer(g)  TorRn (i1sKer(g), N )  hInm-(1f) : TorRn (C, N )  TorRn-1(A, N ). Since hnIm(g), Inm(g), hnsKer(g) and hInm-(1f) are Sisomorphisms, we have the sequence TorRn (B, N )  TorRn (C, N ) -n TorRn-1(A, N )  TorRn-1(B, N ) is S-exact.
Secondly, consider the exact sequence:
TorRn+1(T, N )  TorRn (A, N ) -T-or-Rn-(i-Im-(f-)-,N) TorRn (Im(f ), N )  TorRn (T, N ).
Since T is uniformly S-torsion, TorRn (iIm(f), N ) is an S-isomorphism. Consider the exact sequences:
TorRn+1(Im(g), N )  TorRn (Ker(g), N ) -T-o-rRn-(-iK-er-(g-),-N) TorRn (B, N )  TorRn (Im(g), N )
and
TorRn+1(T , N )  TorRn (Im(g), N ) -T-or-Rn-(i-Im-(-g)-,N) TorRn (C, N )  TorRn (T , N ).
Since T  is uniformly S-torsion, we have TorRn (iIm(g) is an S-isomorphism. Since TorRn (i1sKer(g), N ) and TorRn (i2sKer(g), N ) are S-isomorphisms as above, TorRn (A, N )  TorRn (B, N )  TorRn (C, N ) is S-exact at TorRn (B, N ).
Continue by the above method, we have an S-exact sequence:
...  TorRn (A, N )  TorRn (B, N )  TorRn (C, N ) -n TorRn-1(A, N ) 
TorRn-1(B, N )  ...  TorR1 (C, N ) -1 A R N  B R N  C R N  0.
Corollary 1.6. Let R be a ring, S a multiplicative subset of R and N an R-module. Suppose 0  A -f B -g C  0 is an S-exact sequence of R-modules where B is S-flat. Then TorRn+1(C, N ) is S-isomorphic to TorRn (A, N ) for any n  0. Consequently, TorRn+1(C, N ) is uniformly S-torsion if and only if TorRn (A, N ) is uniformly S-torsion for any n  0.
Proof. It follows from Lemma 1.4 and Theorem 1.5.

2. On the S-flat dimensions of modules

Let R be a ring. The flat dimension of an R-module M is defined as the shortest flat resolution of M. We now introduce the notion of S-flat dimension of an Rmodule as follows.

Definition 2.1. Let R be a ring, S a multiplicative subset of R and M an R-module. We write S-f dR(M)  n (S-f d abbreviates S-flat dimension) if there exists an Sexact sequence of R-modules

0  Fn  ...  F1  F0  M  0

()

where each Fi is S-flat for i = 0, ..., n. The S-exact sequence () is said to be an S-flat S-resolution of length n of M. If such finite S-flat S-resolution does not exist, then we say S-f dR(M) = ; otherwise, define S-f dR(M) = n if n is the length of the shortest S-flat S-resolution of M.

Trivially, the S-flat dimension of an R-module M cannot exceed its flat dimension for any multiplicative subset S of R. And if S is composed of units, then S-f dR(M) = f dR(M). It is also obvious that an R-module M is S-flat if and only if S-f dR(M) = 0.
Lemma 2.2. Let R be a ring, S a multiplicative subset of R. If A is S-isomorphic to B, then S-f dR(A) = S-f dR(B).
Proof. Let f : A  B be an S-isomorphism. If ...  Fn  ...  F1  F0 -g A  0 is an S-resolution of A, then ...  Fn  ...  F1  F0 -f-g B  0 is an Sresolution of B. So S-f dR(A)  S-f dR(B). Note that there is an S-isomorphism g : B  A by Proposition 1.1. Similarly we have S-f dR(B)  S-f dR(A).
Proposition 2.3. Let R be a ring and S a multiplicative subset of R. The following statements are equivalent for an R-module M:
(1) S-f dR(M)  n; (2) TorRn+k(M, N ) is uniformly S-torsion for all R-modules N and all k > 0; (3) TorRn+1(M, N ) is uniformly S-torsion for all R-modules N ; (4) there exists s  S such that sTorRn+1(M, R/I) = 0 for all ideals I of R; (5) if 0  Fn  ...  F1  F0  M  0 is an S-exact sequence, where
F0, F1, ..., Fn-1 are S-flat R-modules, then Fn is S-flat; (6) if 0  Fn  ...  F1  F0  M  0 is an S-exact sequence, where
F0, F1, ..., Fn-1 are flat R-modules, then Fn is S-flat; (7) if 0  Fn  ...  F1  F0  M  0 is an exact sequence, where
F0, F1, ..., Fn-1 are S-flat R-modules, then Fn is S-flat;
7

(8) if 0  Fn  ...  F1  F0  M  0 is an exact sequence, where F0, F1, ..., Fn-1 are flat R-modules, then Fn is S-flat;
(9) there exists an S-exact sequence 0  Fn  ...  F1  F0  M  0, where F0, F1, ..., Fn-1 are flat R-modules and Fn is S-flat;
(10) there exists an exact sequence 0  Fn  ...  F1  F0  M  0, where F0, F1, ..., Fn-1 are flat R-modules and Fn is S-flat;
(11) there exists an exact sequence 0  Fn  ...  F1  F0  M  0, where F0, F1, ..., Fn are S-flat R-modules.
Proof. (1)  (2): We prove (2) by induction on n. For the case n = 0, we have
M is S-flat, then (2) holds by [11, Theorem 3.2]. If n > 0, then there is an S-
exact sequence 0  Fn  ...  F1  F0  M  0, where each Fi is S-flat for i = 0, ..., n. Set K0 = Ker(F0  M ) and L0 = Im(F1  F0). Then both 0  K0  F0  M  0 and 0  Fn  Fn-1  ...  F1  L0  0 are S-exact. Since S-f dR(L0)  n - 1 and L0 is S-isomorphic to K0, S-f dR(K0)  n - 1 by Lemma 2.2. By induction, TorRn-1+k(K0, N ) is uniformly S-torsion for all S-torsion R-modules N and all k > 0. It follows from Corollary 1.6 that TorRn+k(M, N ) is uniformly S-torsion.
(2)  (3), (5)  (6)  (8) and (5)  (7)  (8): Trivial.
(3)  (4): Let N = R/I. Then there exists an element s  S such that
I R
sTorRn+1(M, N ) = 0. So s TorRn+1(M, R/I) = 0. It follows that sTorRn+1(M, R/I) = I R
0 for all ideals I of R.
(4)  (3): Suppose N is generated by {ni|i  }. Set N0 = 0 and N = ni|i <  for each   . Then N have a continuous filtration {N|  } with N+1/N = R/I+1 and I = AnnR(n + N  Rn). Since sTorR1 (M, R/I) = 0 for each   , it is easy to verify sTorR1 (M, N) = 0 by transfinite induction on . So sTorR1 (M, N ) = 0.
(3)  (5): Let 0  Fn -dn Fn-1 -d-n--1 Fn-2... -d2 F1 -d1 F0 -d0 M  0 be an S-exact sequence, where F0, F1, ..., Fn-1 are S-flat. Then Fn is S-flat if and only if TorR1 (Fn, N ) is uniformly S-torsion for all R-modules N , if and only if TorR2 (Im(dn-1), N ) is uniformly S-torsion for all R-modules N . Following these steps, we can show Fn is S-flat if and only if TorRn+1(M, N ) is uniformly S-torsion for all R-modules N.
(10)  (11)  (1) and (10)  (9)  (1): Trivial. (8)  (10) : Let ...  Pn  Pn-1 -d-n--1 Pn-2...  P0  M  0 be a projective resolution of M. Set Fn = Ker(dn-1). Then we have an exact sequence 0  Fn  Pn-1 -d-n--1 Pn-2...  P0  M  0. By (8), Fn is S-flat. So (10) holds.

Corollary 2.4. Let R be a ring and S  S multiplicative subsets of R. Suppose M is an R-module, then S-f dR(M)  S-f dR(M).
Proof. Suppose S  S are multiplicative subsets of R. Let M and N be R-modules. If TorRn+1(M, N ) is uniformly S-torsion, then TorRn+1(M, N ) is uniformly S-torsion. The result follows by Proposition 2.3.
Let R be a ring, S a multiplicative subset of R and M an R-module. For any s  S, we denote by Rs the localization of R at {sn|n  N} and denote Ms = M R Rs as an Rs-module.
Corollary 2.5. Let R be a ring, S a multiplicative subset of R and M an R-module. If S-f dR(M)  n, then there exists an element s  S such that f dRs(Ms)  n.
Proof. Let M be an R-module with S-f dR(M)  n. Then there is an element s  S such that sTorRn+1(R/I, M) = 0 for any ideal I of R by Proposition 2.3. Let Is be an ideal of Rs with I an ideal of R. Then TorRn+s 1(Rs/Is, Ms) = TorRn+1(R/I, M )R Rs = 0 since sTorRn+1(R/I, M ) = 0. Hence f dRs(Ms)  n.
Corollary 2.6. Let R be a ring and S a multiplicative subset of R. Suppose M is an R-module, then S-f dR(M) f dRS MS. Moreover, if S is composed of finite elements, then S-f dR(M ) =f dRS MS.
Proof. Let ...  Fn  ...  F1  F0  M  0 be an exact sequence with each Fi S-flat. By localizing at S, we can obtain a flat resolution of MS over RS as follows:
 (Fn)S  ...  (F1)S  (F0)S  (M )S  0.
So S-f dR(M) f dRS MS by Proposition 2.3. Suppose S is composed of finite elements and f dRS MS = n. Let 0  Fn  Fn-1  ...  F1  F0  M  0 be an exact sequence, where Fi is flat over R for any i = 0, ..., n - 1. Localizing at S, we have (Fn)S is flat over RS. By [11, Proposition 3.8], F is S-flat. So S-f dR(M)  n by Proposition 2.3.
Proposition 2.7. Let R be a ring and S a multiplicative subset of R. Let 0  A  B  C  0 be an S-exact sequence of R-modules. Then the following assertions hold.
(1) S-f dR(C)  1 + max{S-f dR(A), S-f dR(B)}. (2) If S-f dR(B) < S-f dR(C), then S-f dR(A) = S-f dR(C) - 1 > S-f dR(B).
Proof. The proof is similar with that of the classical case (see [10, Theorem 3.6.7]). So we omit it.

Let p be a prime ideal of R and M an R-module. We denote by p-f dR(M) (R-p)f dR(M) briefly. The next result gives a new local characterization of flat dimension of an R-module.
Proposition 2.8. Let R be a ring and M an R-module. Then
f dR(M) = sup{p-f dR(M)|p  Spec(R)} = sup{m-f dR(M)|m  Max(R)}.
Proof. Trivially, sup{m-f dR(M)| m  Max(R)}  sup{p-f dR(M)| p  Spec(R)}  f dR(M). Suppose sup{m-f dR(M)| m  Max(R)} = n. For any R-module N , there exists an element sm  R - m such that smTorRn+1(M, N ) = 0 by Proposition 2.3. Since the ideal generated by all sm is R, we have TorRn+1(M, N ) = 0 for all R-modules N . So f dR(M)  n. Suppose sup{m-f dR(M)| m  Max(R)} = . Then for any n  0, there exists a maximal ideal m and an element sm  R - m such that smTorRn+1(M, N ) = 0 for some R-module N . So for any n  0, we have TorRn+1(M, N ) = 0 for some R-module N . Thus f dR(M) = . So the equalities hold.
3. On the S-weak global dimensions of rings
Recall that the weak global dimension w.gl.dim(R) of a ring R is the supremum of S-flat dimensions of all R-modules. Now, we introduce the S-analogue of weak global dimensions of rings R for a multiplicative subset S of R.
Definition 3.1. The S-weak global dimension of a ring R is defined by S-w.gl.dim(R) = sup{S-f dR(M)|M is an R-module}.
Obviously, S-w.gl.dim(R) w.gl.dim(R) for any multiplicative subset S of R. And if S is composed of units, then S-w.gl.dim(R) =w.gl.dim(R) . The next result characterizes the S-weak global dimension of a ring R.
Proposition 3.2. Let R be a ring and S a multiplicative subset of R. The following statements are equivalent for R:
(1) S-w.gl.dim(R)  n; (2) S-f dR(M)  n for all R-modules M; (3) TorRn+k(M, N ) is uniformly S-torsion for all R-modules M, N and all k > 0; (4) TorRn+1(M, N ) is uniformly S-torsion for all R-modules M, N ; (5) there exists an element s  S such that sTorRn+1(R/I, R/J) for any ideals I
and J of R.
Proof. (1)  (2) and (3)  (4): Trivial. (2)  (3): Follows from Proposition 2.3.
10

(4)  (1): Let M be an R-module and 0  Fn  ...  F1  F0  M  0 an

exact sequence, where F0, F1, ..., Fn-1 are flat R-modules. To complete the proof,

it suffices, by Proposition 2.3, to prove that Fn is S-flat. Let N be an R-module. Thus S-f dR(N )  n by (4). It follows from Corollary 1.6 that TorR1 (N, Fn) = TorRn+1(N, M ) is uniformly S-torsion. Thus Fn is S-flat.

(4)  (5): Let M = R/I and N = R/J. Then there exists s  S such

that

I R

J R

sTorRn+1(M, N ) = s

TorRn+1(R/I, R/J) = 0.

I R,J R

Thus sTorRn+1(R/I, R/J) = 0 for any ideals I, J of R.

(5)  (4): Suppose M is generated by {mi|i  } and N is generated by {ni|i 

}. Set M0 = 0 and M = mi|i <  for each   . Then M have a continuous filtration {M|  } with M+1/M = R/I+1 and I = AnnR(m + M  Rm). Similarly, N have a continuous filtration {N|  } with N+1/N = R/J+1 and
J = AnnR(n + N  Rn). Since sTorRn+1(R/I, R/J) = 0 for each    and   , it is easy to verify sTorRn+1(M, N ) = 0 by transfinite induction on both

positions of M and N.

The following Corollaries 3.4, 3.5, 3.3 and 3.7 can be deduced by Corollaries 2.5, 2.6, 2.4 and Proposition 2.8.

Corollary 3.3. Let R be a ring and S  S multiplicative subsets of R. Then S-w.gl.dim(R)  S-w.gl.dim(R).

Corollary 3.4. Let R be a ring and S a multiplicative subset of R. If S-w.gl.dim(R)  n, then there exists an element s  S such that w.gl.dim(Rs)  n.
Corollary 3.5. Let R be a ring and S a multiplicative subset of R. Then Sw.gl.dim(R)  w.gl.dim(RS). Moreover, if S is composed of finite elements, then S-w.gl.dim(R) =w.gl.dim(RS).

The following example shows that the converse of Corollary 3.5 is not true in general.

Example 3.6. Let R = k[x1, x2, ..., xn+1] be a polynomial ring with n + 1 indeterminates over a field k (n  0). Set S = k[x1] - {0}. Then S is a multiplicative subset of R and RS = k(x1)[x2, ..., xn+1] is a polynomial ring with n indeterminates over the field k(x1). So w.gl.dim(RS) = n by [10, Theorem 3.8.23]. Let s  S, we have Rs = k[x1]s[x2, ..., xn+1]. Since k[x1] is not a G-domain, k[x1]s is not a field (see [7, Theorem 21]). Thus w.gl.dim(k[x1]s) = 1. So w.gl.dim(Rs) = n + 1 for any s  S by [10, Theorem 3.8.23] again. Consequently S-w.gl.dim(R)  n + 1 by Corollary 3.4.

Let p be a prime ideal of a ring R and p-w.gl.dim(R) denote (R - p)-w.gl.dim(R) briefly. We have a new local characterization of weak global dimensions of commutative rings.
Corollary 3.7. Let R be a ring. Then
w.gl.dim(R) = sup{p-w.gl.dim(R)|p  Spec(R)} = sup{m-w.gl.dim(R)|m  Max(R)}.
The rest of this this section mainly consider rings with S-weak global dimensions at most one. Recall from [11] that a ring R is called S-von Neumann regular provided that there exists s  S such that for any a  R there exists r  R such that sa = ra2. Thus by [11, Theorem 3.11], the following result holds.
Corollary 3.8. Let R be a ring and S a multiplicative subset of R. The following assertions are equivalent:
(1) R is an S-von Neumann regular ring; (2) for any R-module M and N , there exists s  S such that sTorR1 (M, N ) = 0; (3) there exists s  S such that sTorR1 (R/I, R/J) = 0 for any ideals I and J of
R; (4) any R-module is R-flat; (5) S-w.gl.dim(R) = 0.
Trivially, von Neumann regular rings are S-von Neumann regular, and if a ring R is S-von Neumann regular ring then RS is von Neumann regular. It was proved in [11, Proposition 3.17] that if the multiplicative subset S of R is composed of nonzero-divisors, then R is S-von Neumann regular if and only if R is von Neumann regular. Examples of S-von Neumann regular rings that are not von Neumann regular, and a ring R for which RS is von Neumann regular but R is not S-von Neumann regular are given in [11].
Proposition 3.9. Let R be a ring and S a multiplicative subset of R. The following assertions are equivalent:
(1) S-w.gl.dim(R)  1; (2) any submodule of S-flat modules is S-flat; (3) any submodule of flat modules is S-flat; (4) TorR2 (M, N ) is uniformly S-torsion for all R-modules M, N ; (5) there exists an element s  S such that sTorR2 (R/I, R/J) = 0 for any ideals
I, J of R.
Proof. The equivalences follow from Proposition 3.2.
12

The following lemma can be found in [3, Chapter 1 Exercise 6.3] for integral domains. However it is also true for any commutative rings and we give a proof for completeness.
Lemma 3.10. Let R be a ring and I, J ideals of R, then TorR2 (R/I, R/J) = Ker() where  : I  J  IJ is an R-homomorphism, where (a  b) = ab.
Proof. Let I and J be ideals of R, then TorR2 (R/I, R/J) = TorR1 (R/I, J). Consider the following exact sequence: 0  TorR1 (R/I, J)  I R J - R R J, where  is an R-homomorphism such that (a  b) = ab. We have TorR2 (R/I, R/J) = Ker().
Trivially, a ring R with w.gl.dim(R)  1 has S-weak global dimension at most one. The following example shows the converse does not hold generally.
Example 3.11. Let A be a ring with w.gl.dim(A) = 1, T = A × A the direct product of A. Set s = (1, 0)  T , then s2 = s. Let R = T [x]/ sx, x2 with x an indeterminate and S = {1, s} be a multiplicative subset of R. Then S-w.gl.dim(R) = 1 but w.gl.dim(R) = .
Proof. Note that every element in R can be written as r = (a, b) + (0, c)x where a, b, c  A. Let f : R  A be a ring homomorphism where f ((a, b) + (0, c)x) = a. Then f makes A a module retract of R. Let I and J be ideals of R. Suppose r1 = (a1, b1) + (0, c1)x and r2 = (a2, b2) + (0, c2) are elements in I and J respectively such that r1  r2  Ker(), where  : I R J  IJ is the multiplicative homomorphism. Then r1r2 = (a1a2, b1b2) + (0, b1c2 + b2c1)x = 0, so a1a2 = 0 in A. By Lemma 3.10, a1 A a2 = 0 in f (I) A f (J) since w.gl.dim(A) = 1. Consequently s2r1 R r2 = sr1 R sr2 = (a1, 0) R (a2, 0) = 0 in I  J. So s2TorR2 (R/I, R/J) = 0 by Lemma 3.10. It follows that S-w.gl.dim(R)  1 by Proposition 3.9. Since RS = A have weak global dimension 1, S-w.gl.dim(R) = 1 by Corollary 3.8 and [11, Corollary 3.14]. Since R is non-reduced coherent ring, then w.gl.dim(R) =  by [4, Corollary 4.2.4].
4. S-weak global dimensions of factor rings and polynomial rings
In this section, we mainly consider the S-weak global dimensions of factor rings and polynomial rings. Firstly, we give an inequality of S-weak global dimensions for ring homomorphisms. Let  : R  T be a ring homomorphism. Suppose S is a multiplicative subset of R, then (S) = {(s)|s  S} is a multiplicative subset of T .
Lemma 4.1. Let  : R  T be a ring homomorphism, S a multiplicative subset of R. Suppose L is a (S)-flat T -module. Then for any R-module X and any n  0,
13

TorRn (X, L) is S-isomorphic to TorRn (X, T ) T L. Consequently, S-f dR(L)  Sf dR(T ).
Proof. If n = 0, then X R L = X R (T T L) = (X R T ) T L. If n = 1, let 0  A  P  X  0 be an exact sequence of R-modules where P is
free. Thus we have two exact sequences of T -module: 0  TorR1 (X, T )  A R T  P R T  X R T  0 and 0  TorR1 (X, L)  A R L  P R L  X R L  0. Consider the following commutative diagram with exact sequence:

0

// 0

// TorR1 (X, L)

// A R L

// P R L

h

=

=

0


// Ker()


// TorR1 (X, T ) T L




// (A R T ) T L


// (P R T ) T L.

Since L is a (S)-flat T -module,  is a (S)-monomorphism. By Theorem 1.3, h
is a (S)-isomorphism over T . So h is an S-isomorphism over R since T -modules
are viewed as R-modules through . By dimension-shifting, we can obtain that TorRn (X, L) is S-isomorphic to TorRn (X, T ) T L for any R-module X and any n  0.
Thus for any R-module X, if TorRn (X, T ) is uniformly S-torsion, then TorRn (X, L) is also uniformly S-torsion. Consequently, S-f dR(L)  S-f dR(T ).

Proposition 4.2. Let  : R  T be a ring homomorphism, S a multiplicative subset of R. Suppose M is an T -module. Then
S-f dR(M)  (S)-f dT (M) + S-f dR(T ).

Proof. Assume (S)-f dT (M) = n < . If n = 0, then M is (S)-flat over T . By Lemma 4.1, S-f dR(M)  n + S-f dR(T ).
Now we assume n > 0. Let 0  A  F  M  0 be an exact sequence of T -modules, where F is a free T -module. Then (S)-f dT (A) = n - 1 by Corollary 1.6 and Proposition 2.3. By induction, S-f dR(A)  n - 1 + S-f dR(T ). Note that S-f dR(T ) = S-f dR(F ). By Proposition 2.7, we have

S-f dR(M)  1 + max{S-f dR(F ), S-f dR(A)}  1 + n - 1 + S-f dR(T ) = (S)-f dT (M) + S-f dR(T ).

Let R be a ring, I an ideal of R and S a multiplicative subset of R. Then  : R  R/I is a ring epimorphism and (S) := S = {s + I  R/I|s  S} is naturally a multiplicative subset of R/I.
14

Proposition 4.3. Let R be a ring, S a multiplicative subset of R. Let a  R be neither a zero-divisor nor a unit. Written R = R/aR and S = {s + aR  R|s  S}. Then the following assertions hold.
(1) Let M be a nonzero R-module. If S-f dR(M) < , then S-f dR(M) = S-f dR(M) + 1.
(2) If S-w.gl.dim(R) < , then
S-w.gl.dim(R)  S-w.gl.dim(R) + 1.
Proof. (1) Set S-f dR(M) = n. Since a  R be neither a zero-divisor nor a unit, then S-f dR(R) = 1. By Proposition 4.2, we have S-f dR(M)  S-f dR(M) + 1 = n + 1. Since S-f dR(M) = n, then there is an injective R-module C such that TorRn (M, C) is not uniformly S-torsion. By [10, Theorem 2.4.22], there is an injective R-module E such that 0  C  E  E  0 is exact. By [10, Proposition 3.8.12(4)], TorRn+1(M, E) = TorRn (M, C). Thus TorRn+1(M, E) is not uniformly S-torsion. So S-f dR(M) = S-f dR(M) + 1.
(2) Let n = S-w.gl.dim(R). Then there is a nonzero R-module M such that Sf dR(M) = n. Thus S-f dR(M) = n+1 by (1). So S-w.gl.dim(R)  S-w.gl.dim(R)+ 1.
Let R be a ring and M an R-module. R[x] denotes the polynomial ring with one indeterminate, where all coefficients are in R. Set M[x] = M R R[x], then M[x] can be seen as an R[x]-module naturally. It is well-known w.gl.dim(R[x]) =w.gl.dim(R) (see [10, Theorem 3.8.23]). In this section, we give a S-analogue of this result. Let S be a multiplicative subset of R, then S is a multiplicative subset of R[x] naturally.
Lemma 4.4. Let R be a ring, S a multiplicative subset of R. Suppose T is an R-module and F is an R[x]-module. Then the following assertions hold.
(1) T is uniformly S-torsion over R if and only if T [x] is a uniformly S-torsion R[x]-module.
(2) If F is S-flat over R[x], then F is S-flat over R.
Proof. (1) If sT [x] = 0 for some s  S, then trivially sT = 0. So T is uniformly S-torsion over R. Suppose sT = 0 for some s  S. Then sT [x] = (sT )[x] = 0. Thus T [x] is a uniformly S-torsion R[x]-module.
(2) Suppose F is an S-flat R[x]-module. By [4, Theorem 1.3.11], TorR1 (F, L)[x] = Tor1R[x](F [x], L[x]) is uniformly S-torsion. Thus there exists an element s  S such that sTorR1 (F, L)[x] = 0. So sTorR1 (F, L) = 0. It follows that F is an S-flat Rmodule.
15

Proposition 4.5. Let R be a ring, S a multiplicative subset of R and M an Rmodule. Then S-f dR[x](M [x]) = S-f dR(M ).
Proof. Assume that S-f dR(M)  n. Then TorRn+1(M, N ) is uniformly S-torsion for any R-module N by Proposition 2.3. Thus for any R[x]-module L, TornR+[x1](M [x], L) = TorRn+1(M, L) is uniformly S-torsion for any R[x]-module L by [4, Theorem 1.3.11]. Consequently, S-f dR[x](M[x])  n by Proposition 2.3.
Let 0  Fn  ...  F1  F0  M[x]  0 be an exact sequence with each Fi S-flat over R[x] (1  i  n). Then it is also S-flat resolution of M[x] over R by Lemma 4.4. Thus TorRn+1(M[x], N ) is uniformly S-torsion for any R-module N by

Proposition 2.3. It follows that sTorRn+1(M [x], N ) = s TorRn+1(M, N ) = 0. Thus i=1
TorRn+1(M, N ) is uniformly S-torsion. Consequently, S-f dR(M )  S-f dR[x](M [x]) by Proposition 2.3 again.

Let M be an R[x]-module then M can be naturally viewed as an R-module. Define  : M[x]  M by

mi  M.

And define  : M[x]  M[x] by

Lemma 4.6. [10, Theorem 3.8.22] Let R be a ring, S a multiplicative subset of R. For any R[x]-module M,

0  M [x] - M [x] - M  0

is exact.

Theorem 4.7. Let R be a ring, S a multiplicative subset of R. Then S-w.gl.dim(R[x]) = S-w.gl.dim(R) + 1.

Proof. Let M be an R[x]-module. Then, by Lemma 4.6, there is an exact sequence over R[x]:
0  M[x]  M[x]  M  0.
By Proposition 2.7 and Proposition 4.5,

S-f dR(M )  S-f dR[x](M )  1 + S-f dR[x](M [x]) = 1 + S-f dR(M )

().

16

Thus if S-w.gl.dim(R) < , then S-w.gl.dim(R[x]) < . Conversely, if S-w.gl.dim(R[x]) < , then for any R-module M, S-f dR(M) = S-
f dR[x](M[x]) <  by Proposition 4.5. Therefore we have S-w.gl.dim(R) <  if and only if S-w.gl.dim(R[x]) < . Now we assume that both of these are finite. Then S-w.gl.dim(R[x])  S-w.gl.dim(R) + 1 by (). Since R = R[x]/xR[x], Sw.gl.dim(R[x])  S-w.gl.dim(R) + 1 by Proposition 4.3. Consequently, we have S-w.gl.dim(R[x]) = S-w.gl.dim(R) + 1. Corollary 4.8. Let R be a ring, S a multiplicative subset of R. Then for any n  1 we have
S-w.gl.dim(R[x1, ..., xn]) = S-w.gl.dim(R) + n. References
