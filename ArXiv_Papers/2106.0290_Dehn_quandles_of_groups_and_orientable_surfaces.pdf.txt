Abstract. Motivated by the construction of free quandles and Dehn quandles of orientable surfaces, we introduce Dehn quandles of groups with respect to their subsets. As a characterisation, we prove that Dehn quandles are precisely those quandles which embed naturally into their enveloping groups. We prove that the enveloping group of the Dehn quandle of a given group with respect to its generating set is a central extension of that group, and that enveloping groups of Dehn quandles of Artin groups and link groups with respect to their standard generating sets are the groups themselves. We discuss orderability of Dehn quandles and prove that free involutory quandles are left orderable whereas certain generalised Alexander quandles are bi-orderable. Specialising to surfaces, we give generating sets for Dehn quandles of mapping class groups of orientable surfaces with punctures and compute their automorphism groups. As applications, we recover a result of Niebrzydowski and Przytycki that the knot quandle of the trefoil knot is isomorphic to the Dehn quandle of the torus and also extend a result of Yetter on epimorphisms of Dehn quandles of orientable surfaces onto certain involutory homological quandles. Finally, we show that involutory quotients of Dehn quandles of closed orientable surfaces of genus less than four are finite.
1. Introduction
Quandles are algebraic systems with a binary operation that encodes the three Reidemeister moves of planar diagrams of links in the 3-space. These objects have shown appearance in a wide spectrum of mathematics including knot theory [16, 17, 24], group theory, mapping class groups [35, 36], set-theoretic solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation and Yetter-Drinfeld Modules [11], Riemannian symmetric spaces [23] and Hopf algebras [2], to name a few. Though quandles already appeared under different guises in the literature, study of these objects gained true momentum after the fundamental works of Joyce [17] and Matveev [24], who showed that link quandles are complete invariants of non-split links up to orientation of the ambient space. Although quandles are strong invariants of links, the isomorphism problem for them is hard. This has motivated search for newer properties, constructions and invariants of quandles themselves.
Groups are natural sources of quandles. In this paper, we consider certain subquandles of conjugation quandles of groups which we refer as Dehn quandles of groups. Our primary motivation is the construction of free quandles and Dehn quandles of orientable surfaces. Recall that a free quandle on a set is simply a union of conjugacy classes of generators in the free group on that set equipped with the quandle operation of conjugation. Let Mg be the mapping class group of a closed orientable surface Sg and Dg the set of isotopy classes of simple closed curves in Sg. It is well-known that Mg is generated by Dehn twists along finitely many simple closed curves from Dg [12, Theorem 4.1]. The binary operation    = T(), where ,   Dg and T is the Dehn twist along , turns Dg into a quandle called the Dehn quandle of the surface Sg. Identifying the isotopy class of a simple closed curve with the corresponding Dehn twist, it turns out that the quandle Dg is a subquandle of the conjugation quandle Conj(Mg) of the mapping class group.

These quandles originally appeared in the work of Zablow [35, 36]. Further, [20, 33, 34] considered a quandle structure on the set of isotopy classes of simple closed arcs in orientable surfaces with at least two punctures, and called it quandle of cords. In the case of a disk with n + 1 punctures, we will see that this quandle is simply the Dehn quandle of the braid group Bn+1 with respect to its standard set of generators. A presentation for the quandle of cords of the disk and the 2-sphere has been given in [20].
Zablow derived some fundamental relations in Dehn quandles [37] and subsequently used them to develop a homology theory based on these quandles. It is shown that isomorphism classes of Lefschetz fibrations over a disk correspond to quandle homology classes in dimension two. In [9], the Dehn quandle structure of the torus has been extended to a quandle structure on the set of its measured geodesic foliations and the quandle homology of this extended quandle has been studied. Niebrzydowski and Przytycki [26] proved that the Dehn quandle of the torus is isomorphic to the fundamental quandle of the trefoil knot. It was suspected that there may be close connections between knot quandles and Dehn quandles. However, the trefoil knot turned out to be somewhat special and the result does not extend in a large number of cases. It has been proved in [38] that if K is a torus knot of type (2, p), where p is odd and 3 p, then K does not admit any non-trivial coloring by elements of a Dehn quandle Dg for any orientable surface Sg of genus g  1. At the same time, all torus knots of type (3, n), where n is even, admit non-trivial Dehn quandle colorings.
The paper introduces Dehn quandles of groups with respect to their subsets. These quandles include many well-known constructions of quandles from groups including the conjugation quandle of a group, the free quandle on a set, Coxeter quandles, Dehn quandles of closed orientable surfaces, quandle of cords of orientable surfaces, knot quandles of prime knots, core quandles of groups and generalised Alexander quandles of groups with respect to fixed-point free automorphisms, to name a few.
The paper is broadly divided into two parts. The first part develops the general theory of Dehn quandles of groups and the second part focuses on Dehn quandles of orientable surfaces. The precise organisation of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we recall some basic terminology and set notations. We begin Section 3 by introducing Dehn quandles of groups and make some basic observations about the construction. We prove that the enveloping group of the Dehn quandle of a given group with respect to its generating set is a central extension of that group (Theorem 3.7). As a characterisation of Dehn quandles, we prove that a quandle is a Dehn quandle of a group with respect to a generating set if and only if the natural map from the quandle to its enveloping group is injective (Theorem 3.8). As a consequence, it follows that a knot is prime if and only if its knot quandle is the Dehn quandle of its knot group with respect to a single Wirtinger generator (Corollary 3.10). We prove that the enveloping group of the Dehn quandle of a group with respect to the generating set of a presentation having only conjugation relations is the group itself (Theorem 3.14). In Section 4, we discuss orderability of Dehn quandles (Proposition 4.1) and deduce that spherical Artin groups are not bi-orderable (Corollary 4.3). We also prove that free involutory quandles are left orderable (Proposition 4.4) and that certain generalised Alexander quandles are bi-orderable (Proposition 4.5). Section 5 deals with Dehn quandles of mapping class groups of orientable surfaces possibly with punctures, and determine generating sets for these quandles (Proposition 5.4). As an application of our construction, we recover a result of Niebrzydowski and Przytycki that the knot quandle of the trefoil knot is isomorphic to the Dehn quandle of the torus (Theorem 5.5). In Section 6, we compute automorphism groups of Dehn quandles of orientable surfaces (Theorem 6.3). In Section 7, we prove that there exist surjective quandle homomorphisms from Dehn quandles of surfaces of positive genus onto certain finite homological quandles arising from the algebraic intersection number (Theorem 7.1). As a consequence, we generalise a similar result of Yetter [34]

who considered the genus two case. We also prove that these homological quandles are simply Dehn quandles of corresponding symplectic groups (Proposition 7.6). Finally, in Section 8, we show that involutory quotients of Dehn quandles of closed orientable surfaces of genus less than four are finite (Theorem 8.4).

2. Preliminaries

We begin by recalling some basic definitions. A quandle is a non-empty set Q together with a binary operation  satisfying the following axioms:

(i) x  x = x for all x  Q. (ii) For each x, y  Q, there exists a unique z  Q such that x = z  y. (iii) (x  y)  z = (x  z)  (y  z) for all x, y, z  Q.

The second axiom is equivalent to the bijectivity of the right multiplication by each element of Q. This gives a dual binary operation -1 on Q defined as x -1 y = z if x = z  y. Thus, the
second axiom is equivalent to saying that

(x  y) -1 y = x and

x -1 y  y = x

for all x, y  Q, and hence it allows cancellations from right. Topologically, the three quandle axioms correspond to the three Reidemeister moves of planar
diagrams of links in the 3-space. Following are some basic examples of quandles, some of which we shall use in the forthcoming sections.
и If G is a group, then the binary operation x  y = yxy-1 turns G into the quandle Conj(G) called the conjugation quandle of G.
и A group G with the binary operation x  y = yx-1y turns G into the quandle Core(G) called the core quandle of G. In particular, if G is a cyclic group of order n, then Core(G) is the dihedral quandle of order n.
и If G is a group and   Aut(G), then G with the binary operation x  y =  xy-1 y forms a quandle Alex(G, ) referred as the generalized Alexander quandle of G with respect to .
и Every link can be assigned a quandle called the link quandle which is a complete invariant of non-split links up to weak equivalence. This fundamental result appeared independently in the works of Joyce [16, 17] and Matveev [24].
Morphisms and automorphisms of quandles are defined in the obvious way. We denote the group of all automorphisms of a quandle Q by Aut(Q). Note that the quandle axioms are equivalent to saying that for each y  Q, the map Sy : Q  Q given by Sy(x) = x  y is an automorphism of Q fixing y. The group Inn(Q) generated by such automorphisms is called the group of inner automorphisms of Q. The group Inn(Q) acts on the quandle Q and the corresponding orbits are referred as connected components of the quandle. Thus, a connected quandle is one that has only one orbit, that is, Inn(Q) acts transitively on Q. For example, a dihedral quandle of odd order is connected whereas that of even order is not. Further, Q is called involutory if x -1 y = x  y for all x, y  Q. For example, the core quandle of any group is involutory. Involutory quandles are also called 2-quandles. In general, for a positive integer n, a quandle Q is called an n-quandle if x  y  y  и и и  y = x for all x, y  Q. Equivalently, a quandle is an n-quandle if and only if each
n times
inner automorphism Sx has order dividing n.

The enveloping group Env(Q) of a quandle Q is the group with the set of generators as {ex | x  Q} and the defining relations as
exy = eyexe-y 1 for all x, y  Q. For example, if Q is a trivial quandle, then Env(Q) is the free abelian group of rank equal to the cardinality of Q. The enveloping group of the link quandle Q(L) of a link L is the link group G(L) of L [16, 17]. The natural map
 : Q  Env(Q)
given by (x) = ex is a quandle homomorphism with Env(Q) viewed as the conjugation quandle. The map  is not injective in general. The functor from the category of quandles to that of groups assigning the enveloping group to a quandle is left adjoint to the functor from the category of groups to that of quandles assigning the conjugation quandle to a group. Thus, enveloping groups play a crucial role in understanding of quandles themselves.
We conclude this section by setting some notation. By [32, Lemma 4.4.7], any element in a quandle can be written in a left-associated product of the form
((и и и ((a0 e1 a1) e2 a2) e3 и и и) en-1 an-1) en an,
which, for simplicity, we write as a0 e1 a1 e2 и и и en an.
For elements g, h of a group G, we denote the commutator ghg-1h-1 by [g, h] and the element hgh-1 by gh.

3. Dehn quandles of groups In this main section, we introduce and develop the theory of Dehn quandles of groups.

3.1. Presentations and closure properties of Dehn quandles of groups. Let G be a group, A a non-empty subset of G and AG the set of all conjugates of elements of A in G. The Dehn quandle D(AG) of G with respect to A is defined as the set AG equipped with the binary operation

of conjugation, that is,

x  y = yxy-1

for all x, y  D(AG). Clearly, D(AG) is a subquandle of Conj(G) for each subset A of G. We will see later that every

subquandle of Conj(G) is a Dehn quandle, and that Dehn quandles of groups with respect to a set

of generators are of particular interest.

Dehn quandles of groups generalise many well-known constructions of quandles from groups. First, notice that D(GG) is the conjugation quandle Conj(G). If F (S) is the free group generated by S, then D(SF (S)) is the free quandle on S [18, 19, 28]. If W is a Coxeter group with Coxeter generating set S, then D(SW ) is the so called Coxeter quandle [27, 1]. Notice that Coxeter quandles

turn out to be involutory. Let Sg be a closed orientable surface of genus g and Mg its mapping class group. If S is the set of Dehn twists about essential simple closed curves, then D(SMg ) is the

Dehn quandle of the surface [35, 36, 20]. We will discuss Coxeter quandles and Dehn quandles of

surfaces in detail in the upcoming sections.

Remark 3.1. We note that [3] gives a similar but different construction of quandles from groups. By [3, Proposition 4.3], the construction in [3] agrees with the Dehn quandle D(AG) if and only if
elements of A are pairwise non-conjugate in G. Thus, for a fairly large class of groups including

DEHN QUANDLES OF GROUPS AND ORIENTABLE SURFACES

knot groups, mapping class groups, Artin groups and Coxeter groups, our construction differs from the one in [3].
We begin with the following basic and useful observation.
Proposition 3.2. If G is a group generated by S, then D(SG) is generated as a quandle by S.
Proof. If x  D(SG), then x = gsg-1 for some s  S and g  G. Since S generates G as a group, we have g = s11s22 и и и skk for some si  S and i  {1, -1}. Thus, we can write x = s11 s22 и и и skk s s-k k и и и s-2 2 s-1 1 = s  k sk  k-1 sk-1  k-2 и и и  1 s1.
We now observe some closure properties of Dehn quandles. Proposition 3.3. Let A and B be subsets of groups G and H, respectively. Then D(AG)ОD(BH ) = D((A О B)GОH ).
Proof. The proof follows from the fact that conjugacy classes in direct products of two groups correspond to products of conjugacy classes.
Recall that the disjoint union of two quandles can be viewed as a quandle where elements of one quandle acts trivially on elements of the other. The following observation is a direct consequence of definitions. Proposition 3.4. Let A and B be subsets of groups G and H, respectively. Then D(AG) D(BH ) = D((A B)GОH ), where A and B are viewed as subsets of G О H via natural inclusions.
Given two quandle Q1 = S1 | R1 and Q2 = S2 | R2 , we can define their free product as
Q1 Q2 = S1 S2 | R1 R2 . Proposition 3.5. Let A and B be generating sets of groups G and H, respectively. Then D(AG) D(BH ) = D (A B)G H , where and stand for free products of groups and quandles, respectively.
Proof. Note that A B generates G H. Let
 : D(AG)  D (A B)G H

and  : D(BH )  D (A B)G H

denote natural embeddings of quandles given by (s) = s and (t) = t for s  A and t  B. By the universal property of free products, there is a unique quandle homomorphism  : D(AG) D(BH )  D (A B)G H which restricts to  and j on D(AG) and D(BH ), respectively.
We claim that  is a bijection. By Proposition 3.2, A B generates the quandle D (A B)G H ,
and hence  is surjective. Let a = a1  2 a2  3 a3  и и и  k ak and b = b1 2 b2 3 b3  и и и l bl be two elements in D(AG) D(BH ) such that (a) = (b), where ai, bj  A B. Consider the element

c = a1  2 a2  3 и и и  k ak -l bl -l-1 bl-1 -l-2 и и и -2 b2

=

b-2 2 b-3 3 и и и b-l l akk akk--11 и и и a22

a1

b-2 2 b-3 3 и и и b-l l akk akk--11 и и и a22

-1
.

Since  is a homomorphism, it follows that (c) = (b1), which implies that (a1) = a1 and (b1) = b1 are conjugates in G H. Since no element of G is conjugate to an element of H in the

6

free product G H, without loss of generality, we can assume that both a1, b1  A. Further, two elements of G are conjugates in G H only if they are conjugated by some element of G. Thus,
b-2 2 b-3 3 и и и b-l l akk akk--11 и и и a22  G,
and hence we can write
b-2 2 b-3 3 и и и b-l l akk akk--11 и и и a22 = x11 x22 и и и xrr .
where xi  A. This implies that c = a1 r xr r-1 xr-1 r-2 и и и 1 x1  D(AG). Since  is injective on D(AG), we have c = b1, and hence a = b.

It is routine to check that propositions 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 hold for arbitrary direct products, unions and free products, respectively.

3.2. Enveloping groups of Dehn quandles of groups. For a group G and a subset A of G, let c(AG) denote the number of connected components of D(AG). Note that, c(AG) equals the number
of conjugacy classes of elements of G represented by elements of A.

Theorem 3.6. Let G be a group generated by S. Then the following hold:
(i) Env(D(SG)) is generated by {es| s  S}. (ii) Env(D(SG))ab = Zc(SG).
Proof. Any element x  SG can be written in the form x = s11s22 и и и skk s0s-k k и и и s-2 2s-1 1 for some si  S and i  {1, -1}. Then, we see that

e = e x

s11 s22 иииskk s0s-k k иииs-2 2 s1- 1

= es0 k sk k-1 sk-1 k-2 иии 1 s1

= es11 es22 и и и eskk es0 e-sk k и и и e-s2 2 e-s1 1 ,

which proves assertion (i).
In view of (i), the abelianization Env(D(SG))ab is generated by cosets [es] for s  S. Furthermore,
these cosets satisfy relations [egsg-1] = [es] and [es][es ] = [es ][es] for s, s  S and g  G. Thus, [es] = [es ] in Env(D(SG))ab if and only if s, s  S are conjugate in G. Hence, Env(D(SG))ab is a free abelian group of rank c(SG), which is assertion (ii).

We note that the second assertion in Theorem 3.6 also follows from [4, Proposition 3.3(1)]. Let G be a group generated by S and
 : Env(D(SG))  G
be the map defined by (ex) = x for x  D(SG). Since (exy) = (eyxy-1) = yxy-1 = (eyexe-y 1) for all x, y  D(SG) and S generates G, it follows that  is a surjective group homomorphism.

Theorem 3.7. Let G be a group generated by S. Then

(3.2.1)

1  ker()  Env(D(SG))  G  1

is a central extension of groups. Further, if Gab has torsion, then the extension (3.2.1) does not split.

DEHN QUANDLES OF GROUPS AND ORIENTABLE SURFACES

Proof. By Theorem 3.6(i), Env(D(SG)) is generated by {es| s  S}. Thus, any g  ker() can be written as g = es11 es22 и и и eskk . This gives s11 s22 и и и skk = (es11 es22 и и и eskk ) = (g) = 1. Now, for any ex  Env(D(SG)), we have

gexg-1 = es11 es22 и и и eskk exe-sk k и и и e-s2 2 e-s1 1 = ex k sk k-1 sk-1 k-2 иии 1 s1 = es11 s22 иииskk x sk- k иииs-2 2 s-1 1 = ex

by relations in Env D SG (since s11 s22 и и и skk = 1).

Hence, the extension (3.2.1) is central. Now, suppose that Gab has torsion and (3.2.1) splits. Then we have Env(D(SG)) = ker() О G. Taking abelianization and using Theorem 3.6(ii), we get Zc(SG) = Env(D(SG))ab = ker() О Gab, a contradiction. Hence, the sequence does not split.

The next result gives characterisations of Dehn quandles.

Theorem 3.8. The following statements are equivalent for any quandle Q:
(i) Q embeds in Conj(G) for some group G. (ii) The natural map  : Q  Env(Q) is injective. (iii) Q = D(SG) for some group G and a generating set S of G.

Proof. For (i)  (ii), suppose that  : Q  Conj(G) is an embedding for some group G. Then, by [17, p.42], there is a unique group homomorphism ^ : Env(Q)  G such that  = ^ . Thus,  is injective. The implication (ii)  (i) is obvious.
For (ii)  (iii), suppose that Q is a quandle for which the map  is injective. Let A be the set of representatives of orbits (connected components) of Q. We claim that elements of (A) are pairwise non-conjugate in Env(Q). Let x and y be distinct elements of A such that ex = geyg-1, where g = ex11 ex22 и и и exkk for xi  Q and i  {1, -1}. Then,
ex = ex11 ex22 и и и exkk eye-xk k и и и e-x2 2 e-x1 1 = ey k xk k-1 xk-1 k-2 иии 1 x1 .
Since  is injective, it follows that x = y  k xk  k-1 xk-1  k-2 и и и  1 x1, that is, x and y are in the same orbit, a contradiction. It now follows from [3, Proposition 4.3 and Theorem 4.5] that Q = D((A)Env(Q)). If S is a generating set for Q, then (S) is a generating set for Env(Q). Further, S intersects every orbit of Q, and therefore we can choose a representative of an orbit from S. In other words, the set A can be chosen to be a subset of S. For this choice of A, elements of (S) are conjugates of elements of (A) in Env(Q). Thus, (S)Env(Q) = (A)Env(Q) as sets, and hence Q = D((S)Env(Q)).
For (iii)  (ii), suppose that Q = D(SG) for some group G and a generating set S of G. Let  : D(SG)  Conj(G) be the natural embedding. Further, have quandle homomorphisms  : D(SG)  Conj(Env(D(SG))) and  : Conj(Env(D(SG)))  Conj(G). Since   =  , it follows that  is injective.
In fact, if Q is a subquandle of Conj(G) for some group G, then Q = D(Q Q ), where Q is the subgroup of G generated by Q. Following are some immediate consequences of Theorem 3.8.

Corollary 3.9. If G is a group, then every subquandle of Conj(G) is a Dehn quandle.

Corollary 3.10. A knot K is prime if and only if its knot quandle Q(K) is isomorphic to D(xG(K)), where x is a Wirtinger generator of the knot group G(K).

8

Proof. It is known from [30] that K is a prime knot if and only if the map  : Q(K)  G(K) is injective. Since the knot quandle Q(K) is known to be connected [17, Corollary 15.3], the assertion now follows from Theorem 3.8.
As an application of Corollary 3.10, we shall retrieve the main result of [26] in Theorem 5.5.
Proposition 3.11. The core quandle of a group is a Dehn quandle of some group.
Proof. If G is a group, then it follows from [6, Proposition 6.2] that Core(G) embeds in Conj(H) for some group H. The result now follows from Theorem 3.8.
An automorphism of a group is fixed-point free if it does not fix any non-identity element of the group.
Proposition 3.12. Let G be a group and  a fixed-point free automorphism of G. Then the generalised Alexander quandle Alex(G, ) is a Dehn quandle.
Proof. We claim that the natural quandle homomorphism Alex(G, )  Conj(Inn(Alex(G, ))) defined by x  Sx is injective. Suppose that Sx = Sy for x, y  Alex(G, ). Then, we have Sx(z) = Sy(z) for all z  Alex(G, ). This give (z)(x)-1x = (z)(y)-1y, which further implies that (xy-1) = xy-1. Since  is fixed-point free, we must have x = y. Thus, Alex(G, ) embeds in Conj(Inn(Alex(G, ))), and the result now follows from Corollary 3.9.

Recall that a discrete group is said to be rationally acyclic if its homology groups with coefficients in the trivial module Q vanish in all dimensions more than zero. Examples of rationally acyclic groups include Coxeter groups [10, Theorem 15.1.1], Higman's group, binate groups [7] and symmetric groups on infinite sets [14]. Let rk(G) denote the torsion-free rank of an abelian group G, that is, rk(G) = dimQ(G Z Q). The following result generalises [1, Proposition 4.5].
Theorem 3.13. If G is a rationally acyclic group generated by S, then rk(ker()) = c(SG). Further, there is an isomorphism of cohomology rings
H(Env(D(SG)), Q) = H(ker(), Q).

Proof. By [8, Chapter VII, Corollary 6.4], the central extension

(3.2.2)

1  ker()  Env(D(SG))  G  1

gives the exact sequence
H2(G, Q)  H1(ker(), Q)  H1(Env(D(SG)), Q)  H1(G, Q)  0
of rational homology groups. Since G is rationally acyclic, the preceding exact sequence gives H1(ker(), Q) = H1(Env(D(SG)), Q). Thus, we have

rk(ker()) = dimQ(ker() Z Q) = dimQ H1(ker(), Q) = dimQ H1 Env D SG , Q = dimQ Env D SG ab Z Q = c(SG)

(by Theorem 3.6).

The second assertion follows by applying the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence Er, to the central extension (3.2.2). Notice that the second page terms of the spectral sequence are given

DEHN QUANDLES OF GROUPS AND ORIENTABLE SURFACES

by E2p,q = Hp(G, Hq(ker(), Q)) and the spectral sequence converges to Hp+q(Env(D(SG)), Q). Since G is rationally acyclic, the universal coefficient theorem gives Hp(G, Q) = 0 for p  1. This together with the fact that the extension is central implies that E2p,q = Hp(G, Q)  Hq(ker(), Q) = Hq(ker(), Q) for p = 0 and 0 for p  1.

Theorem 3.14. If G is a group with a presentation S | R such that R consists of relations only of the form wsw-1 = t for some s, t  S and w  G, then
Env(D(SG)) = G.
Proof. We show that the surjective group homomorphism  : Env(D(SG))  G is, in fact, an isomorphism. Any relation in the presentation S | R of G is of the form wsw-1 = t for some s, t  S and w  G. We write w = s11s22 и и и skk for some si  S and i  {1, -1}. Define a homomorphism  : F (S)  Env(D(SG)) by setting (s) = es for each s  S, where F (S) is the free group on S. By a repeated use of relations of the form ey xy- = eyexe-y in Env(D(SG)), we see that
(wsw-1) =  s11 s22 и и и skk ss-k k и и и s-2 2 s-1 1 = es11 es22 и и и eskk ese-sk k и и и e-s2 2 e-s1 1 = es11 s22 иииskk ss-k k иииs-2 2 s1- 1 = ewsw-1
= et
= (t).

Thus, we have a homomorphism  : G  Env(D(SG)). By Theorem 3.6(i), Env(D(SG)) is gener-
ated by {es | s  S}, and hence  is surjective. Finally, since  is the identity map, it follows that  is an isomorphism of groups.

Recall that an Artin group A is a group with a presentation

A = {s1, s2, . . . , sn | (sisj)mij = (sjsi)mij , mij  {2, 3, 4, . . .}  {}},
where (sisj)mij is the word sisjsisjsi . . . of length mij if mij <  and there is no relation (sisj)mij = (sjsi)mij if mij = . We set S = {s1, s2, . . . , sn} and refer to mij's as exponents. Notice that Aab = Zc(SA). A Coxeter group W is a quotient of A by imposing additional relations s2i = 1 for all si  S. The pair (W, S) is referred as a Coxeter system. For brevity, Dehn quandles of Artin and Coxeter groups with respect to their standard generating sets will be referred as Artin and Coxeter quandles, respectively.
Corollary 3.15. If A is an Artin group generated by S, then Env(D(SA)) = A.

Proof. Notice that a relation (sisj)mij = (sjsi)mij in A can be written in terms of conjugation as (sisj )mij-1 sj ((sisj )mij-1)-1 = sj if mij is even, (sisj )mij-1 si ((sisj )mij-1)-1 = sj if mij is odd.
The result now follows from Theorem 3.14.

It is known from [1] that if (W, S) is a Coxeter system, then Env(D(SW )) is an intermediate group between W and the corresponding Artin group. Thus, the preceding corollary shows a contrast between Dehn quandles of Artin groups and that of Coxeter groups.

Let L be an oriented link in the 3-sphere, D(L) its link diagram and S = {x1, x2, . . . , xn} its set of labelled arcs. Then the link group G(L) = 1(S3 \ L) of L is generated by S and has defining relations at each crossing in D(L) as shown in Figure 1. Thus, all relations in the Wirtinger
presentation of G(L) are conjugation relations.

Corollary 3.16. If L is a link and S a Wirtinger generating set for G(L), then
Env(D(SG(L))) = G(L).
Let ct(SG) denote the number of conjugacy classes of elements of G represented by torsion elements of S. Note that, if every element of S is torsion, then ct(SG) = c(SG).
Proposition 3.17. If G is a group generated by S, then Zct(SG)  ker(). Further, the equality holds for Artin groups, Coxeter groups and link groups with their standard generating sets.
Proof. Let s  S be a torsion element, say sn = 1. Then (ens ) = sn = 1, and hence ens  ker(). Since ker() is central in Env(D(SG)), it follows that ens = exens e-x 1 = (exese-x 1)n = enxsx-1 for all x  D(SG). This implies that Zct(SG)  ker().
Since Artin generators of Artin groups are torsion free, the equality holds by Corollary 3.15. For Coxeter groups, the equality is proved in [1, Theorem 3.1]. Finally, since Wirtinger generators of link groups are torsion free, the equality holds by Corollary 3.16.
We note that Proposition 3.17 extends a recent result of Akita [1, Theorem 3.1] who considered enveloping groups of Coxeter quandles. Next, we obtain a presentation for the enveloping group of Dehn quandle of a surface group of genus more than one. Recall that, for a closed orientable surface Sg, we have
g
1(Sg) = a1, b1, . . . ag, bg | [ai, bi] = 1 .
i=1
Let S = {a1, b1, . . . ag, bg}.
Theorem 3.18. If g  2, then
g
Env(D(S1(Sg))) = t, a1, b1, . . . , ag, bg | [t, ai] = [t, bi] = 1, [ai, bi] = t .
i=1
Proof. By Theorem 3.7, we have the central extension
1  ker()  E  1(Sg)  1,

DEHN QUANDLES OF GROUPS AND ORIENTABLE SURFACES

where E := Env(D(S1(Sg))). By [8, Chapter VII, Corollary 6.4], we get the exact sequence

(3.2.3)

и и и  H2(1(Sg), Z)  H1(ker(), Z)  H1(E, Z)  H1(1(Sg), Z)  0.

Note that H1(1(Sg), Z) = Z2g and H2(1(Sg), Z) = Z. Further, by Theorem 3.6(ii), we have H1(E, Z) = Z2g. Thus, the exact sequence (3.2.3) takes the form

и и и  Z  ker()  Z2g  Z2g  0.

Since every surjective homomorphism from a free abelian group to itself is an isomorphism, we
deduce that ker() is a cyclic group. Now, we have the following cases.
(1) ker() is trivial: In this case, E = 1(Sg). Since each relation in E can be written as a conjugation relation between the generators, it follows that the relation 2i=g 1[ai, bi] = 1 can also be written as wxw-1 = y for some x, y  S and w  1(Sg). If x = y, then rank of H1(E, Z) is less than 2g, a contradiction. If x = y and w is non-trivial, then we have a free abelian group of rank two x, w inside 1(Sg), again a contradiction, since 1(Sg) is a Fuchsian group. Hence, this case does not arise.
(2) ker() = t | tn = 1 for n > 1: By [22, Lemma 2.5], the group E has a presentation

g
E = t, a1, b1, . . . , ag, bg | tn = [t, ai] = [t, bi] = 1, [ai, bi] = tk ,
i=1

for some integer k with 1  k  n. If gcd(k, n) = 1, then the abelianization of E will
have a torsion element of order gcd(k, n), which is a contradiction. Thus, we can assume that gcd(k, n) = 1. We claim that in this case the relation tn = 1 cannot be written as a conjugation
relation. Suppose that we can do so, that is, there exist x, y  S and non-trivial w  E such that wxw-1 = y. If x, y are distinct, then H1(E, Z) has rank less then 2g, which is contradiction. If x = y and w is non-trivial, then the group x, w is abelian, and hence ( x, w ) is an abelian
subgroup of 1(Sg). Thus, ( x, w ) must be an infinite cyclic group, and (w) is a power of (x). This implies that w  t, x , and hence the relation tn = 1 can be recovered from the relation [t, x] = 1. Thus, the relation tn = 1 can be removed from the presentation of E, in
which case t will be of infinite order, a contradiction. Hence, this case does not arise.
(3) ker() = t : Again, by [22, Lemma 2.5], a presentation of E is

g
E = t, a1, b1, . . . , ag, bg | [t, ai] = [t, bi] = 1, [ai, bi] = tk
i=1

for some integer k with |k| 0. The case k = 0 is not possible as it gives rank of H1(E, Z) to be 2g + 1, a contradiction. Further, |k| 2 gives torsion in H1(E, Z), again a contradiction. Hence, the only possibility is

g
E = t, a1, b1, . . . , ag, bg | [t, ai] = [t, bi] = 1, [ai, bi] = t ,
i=1

where = ▒1. But, the groups for both the choices of are isomorphic, which is desired.

3.3. Automorphisms of Dehn quandles of groups. We conclude this section with some observations on automorphisms of Dehn quandles. The following result [27, Theorem 3.1] is motivated by the construction of an augmented quandle [16].

Theorem 3.19. Let G be a group admitting a right action on a quandle X and  : X  G is a map such that (X) generates G.
(i) If x  y = x и (y) for all x, y  X, then the action induces a surjective group homomorphism G  Inn(X).
(ii) If the action is effective (faithful), then G = Inn(X) and the action of G on X agrees with the natural Inn(X) action on X.
As a consequence, we obtain.
Proposition 3.20. Let G be a group and X be a subquandle of Conj(G) such that X generates G. Then Inn(X) = G/Z(G) = Inn(Conj(G)).
Proof. Since X generates the group G, each element g  G can be written as g = x11x22 и и и xnn for xi  X and i = ▒1. Further, since X is a subquandle of Conj(G), the usual conjugation action of G on itself keeps X invariant, and hence induces an action on X. Let  : X  G be the inclusion map. By Theorem 3.19(i), there is a surjective group homomorphism f : G  Inn(X). But, ker(f ) = Z(G), and hence G/Z(G) = Inn(X). On the other hand, for any group G, we have Inn(Conj(G)) = G/Z(G).
Corollary 3.21. Let G be a group generated by the conjugacy class X of an element of G. Then the following hold:
(i) Inn(Conj(G)) = G/Z(G) = Inn(X). (ii) AutX (G)  Aut(X), where AutX (G) consists of group automorphisms of G that preserve X
and Aut(X) is the group of quandle automorphisms of X. (iii) X is a connected quandle.
Proof. Assertion (i) follows from Proposition 3.20 once we notice that X is a subquandle of Conj(G). Assertion (ii) follows since any f  AutX (G) restricts to a quandle automorphism of X. Note that the conjugation action of G and hence that of G/Z(G) on X is transitive. Hence, by (i), Inn(X) acts transitively on X.
In view of Proposition 3.20, we have
Corollary 3.22. If G is a group generated by S, then Inn(D(SG)) = G/Z(G).
Computing Aut(D(AG)) seems challenging in general. Recall that the Dehn quandle of a free group with respect to its free generating set is the free quandle on that set. A presentation of the automorphism group of the free quandle of rank n is known [13], where it is shown to be isomorphic to the welded braid group on n strands.

4. Orderability of Dehn quandles of groups
A quandle Q is said to be left-orderable if there is a (strict) linear order < on Q such that x < y implies z  x < z  y for all x, y, z  Q. Similarly, a quandle Q is right-orderable if there is a (strict) linear order < on Q such that x < y implies x  z < y  z for all x, y, z  Q. A quandle is bi-orderable if it has a (strict) linear order with respect to which it is both left and right ordered. Orderability of groups is defined analogously. Orderability of quandles, particularly of link quandles, has been considered in detail in a recent work [29]. For Dehn quandles of groups, we have the following result.
Proposition 4.1. Let G be a group and A its subset containing two distinct elements x, y such that xyx = yxy. Then the Dehn quandle D(AG) is neither right nor left orderable.

DEHN QUANDLES OF GROUPS AND ORIENTABLE SURFACES

13

Proof. Notice that the braid relation xyx = yxy can be written in D(AG) in the form x  y  x = y and y  x  y = x. Assume that there exists a right order < on D(AG). Without loss of generality,
we can assume that x < y. By right orderability, we have x < y x = xy < y xy = xy <
x = xyx < x = y < x, which is a contradiction. Similarly, suppose that we have a left order
< such that x < y. Then y x < y = xy x < xy = y < xy = y < y xy = y < x, again a contradiction. Hence, D(AG) is neither right nor left orderable.

Corollary 4.2. Let G be a group containing two distinct elements x, y such that xyx = yxy. Then G is not a bi-orderable group.
Proof. Let us set A = {x, y}. Then, by Proposition 4.1, the quandle D(AG) is not right orderable. By [5, Proposition 3.4], if a group is bi-orderable, then its conjugation quandle is right orderable. Since D(AG) is a subquandle of Conj(G), it follows that G cannot be a bi-orderable group.

The following corollary recovers the known result about failure of bi-orderability of spherical Artin groups [25, Theorem 5.8.], except for I2(2m) with m  3.
Corollary 4.3. Artin groups with an odd exponent are not bi-orderable.

Proof. Let si, sj  S be two Artin generators such that mij is odd. Then, as in the proof of Proposition 4.1, the relation (sisj)mij = (sjsi)mij can be written in D(SA) in the form (si sj)mij = sj and (sj  si)mij = si. Now arguments as in the proof of Proposition 4.1 shows that D(SA) is not right orderable. By [5, Proposition 3.4], if A is a bi-orderable group, then Conj(A) is a right orderable quandle. But, D(SA) is a subquandle of Conj(A), a contradiction.
In the positive direction, it is known that the conjugation quandle Conj(G) = D(GG) of a biorderable group G is right-orderable [5, Proposition 3.4(1)] and that the free quandle D(SF (S)) is right orderable [5, Theorem 3.5]. A free involutory quandle is a free object in the category of involutory quandles. A model for a free involutory quandle is the Dehn quandle D(SU ) of the universal Coxeter group U on the set S. Recall that, U is simply the free product of cyclic groups of order two one for each element of S. We have the following result regarding the left orderability of free involuntary quandles.

Proposition 4.4. Free involutory quandles are left orderable.
Proof. If U is the universal Coxeter group generated by S, then D(SU ) is the free involutory quandle on S. By [32, Theorem 4.4.4], the quandle D(SU ) consists of left-associated products of the form
xn  xn-1  и и и  x1 ,
where n  1 and x1, x2, . . . , xn  S with xi = xi+1. By [32, Lemma 4.4.2], the multiplication of such products is given by
(4.0.1) (xnxn-1и и иx1)(ymym-1и и иy1) = xnxn-1и и иx1y1и и иym-1ymym-1и и иy1. Let F (S) be the free group on S and  : D(SU )  Core(F (S)) be the map defined by
(xn  xn-1  и и и  x1) = xd11 xd22 и и и xndn--11 xdnn xdnn--11 и и и xd22 xd11 , where x1, x2, . . . , xn  S with xi = xi+1 and di = (-1)i+1 for 1  i  n. Using (4.0.1), it can be checked that  is a quandle homomorphism. Further, it turns out that  is injective, and hence we have an embedding of D(SU ) into Core(F (S)). Since free groups are bi-orderable [31], it follows from [5, Proposition 3.4] that the quandle Core(F (S)) is left orderable. Hence, the free involutory quandle D(SU ) is left orderable.

Proposition 4.5. Let < be a bi-ordering on a group G and   Aut(G). Then the following statements are equivalent:
(i) < is a bi-ordering on Alex(G, ). (ii) 1 < (g) < g for all g  G with 1 < g, where 1 is the identity of G.
Proof. For (i)  (ii), let g  G be such that 1 < g. Since < is a bi-ordering on Alex(G, ), we have 1 < g  1 and 1 < 1  g. This gives 1 < (g) and 1 < (g)-1g, and hence 1 < (g) < g.
For (ii)  (i), let x, y, z  G be such that x < y. This gives 1 < yx-1, and hence 1 < (y)(x)-1 < yx-1. Since < is a bi-ordering on G, it follows that (x) < (y) and (x)-1x < (y)-1y. Again using bi-ordering on G, we get (x)(z)-1z < (y)(z)-1z and (z)(x)-1x < (z)(y)-1y. By definition, this gives x  z < y  z and z  x < z  y, which is desired.
An automorphism satisfying statement (ii) of Proposition 4.5 is clearly fixed-point free. By Proposition 3.12, generalised Alexander quandles with respect to fixed-point free automorphisms of groups are Dehn quandles. Thus, Proposition 4.5 gives examples of bi-orderable Dehn quandles.

5. Dehn quandles of orientable surfaces
Let Sg,p be an orientable surface of genus g with p punctures (marked points). The mapping class group Mg,p of Sg,p is defined as the set of isotopy classes of orientation preserving selfhomeomorphisms which permute the set P of punctures. We will frequently refer to [12] for related results on mapping class groups. In this section, we investigate Dehn quandle of Sg,p.
A simple closed curve in Sg,p is an embedding of a circle into the interior of the surface. We say that such a curve is essential if it is not homotopic to a point or a puncture. A simple closed arc is an embedding  : [0, 1]  Sg,p of a closed interval into the surface such that -1(P ) = {0, 1}. Such an arc is essential if (0) = (1). Throughout, by a simple closed curve or an arc, we mean an essential simple closed curve or an arc. For simplicity, we avoid writing p in the notations whenever it is zero. By abuse of notation we use the same symbol to denote the isotopy class and a representative of a curve and an arc.
Given a simple closed curve  and a simple closed arc  on Sg,p, we denote the right hand Dehn twist along  by T and the anti-clockwise half twist about the arc  by H.
Lemma 5.1. Let Sg,p be a closed orientable surface of genus g with p punctures.
(i) Let ,  be simple closed curves in Sg,p. Then T is isotopic to T if and only if  is isotopic to  .
(ii) Let ,  be simple closed arcs in Sg,p. Then H is isotopic to H if and only if  is isotopic to  .
Proof. The first assertion is proved in [12, Section 3.3]. By [21, Section 1.6.2], if  is isotopic to  , then H is isotopic to H . The converse implication is proved in [20, Lemma 4.1]. However, we provide a shorter alternate proof here for the sake of completeness. Suppose that H is isotopic to H . Then (H)2 = T is isotopic to (H )2 = T , where  and  are simple closed curves enclosing regular neighbourhoods of  and  , respectively. It follows from assertion (i) that  is isotopic to  . Choose  in the isotopy class of  (and hence  ) such that it does not intersect  and  . Cutting the surface along , we see that either  and  lie in different components of Sg,p \  or they both lie in the disk component with two punctures (the one bounded by ). The former case implies that H is not isotopic to H , a contradiction. Hence,  and  lie in the same disk with two punctures, and therefore must be isotopic as closed arcs.

Let Dg,p denote the set of isotopy classes of all simple closed curves and simple closed arcs in Sg,p. A simple closed curve  is said to be non-separating if Sg,p \  is connected, and called separating otherwise. Separating and non-separating simple closed arcs are defined similarly. Let Dgn,sp be its subset consisting of isotopy classes of all non-separating simple closed curves and simple closed arcs in Sg,p. In view of Lemma 5.1, for each isotopy class y  Dg,p of a simple closed curve, we can define Ty to be the isotopy class of the right hand Dehn twist along any simple closed curve representing y. Similarly, if y represents an isotopy class of a simple closed arc, then we can define Hy to be the isotopy class of the anti-clockwise half twist about the punctures joined by any arc representing y. Thus, Lemma 5.1 defines an injective map
 : Dg,p  Mg,p
by setting
 (x) = Tx if x is the isotopy class of a simple closed curve, Hx if x is the isotopy class of a simple closed arc.
We will often identify elements of Dg,p with corresponding Dehn twists and half twists via  . The following assertion follows from [12, Corollary 4.15].
Lemma 5.2. For each g, p  0, the group Mg,p is generated by finitely many Dehn twists about non-separating simple closed curves and half twists about simple closed arcs.
Lemma 5.3. The following hold for each f  Mg,p. (i) If x is the isotopy class of a simple closed curve in Sg,p, then f Txf -1 = Tf(x). (ii) If y is the isotopy class of a simple closed arc in Sg,p, then f Hyf -1 = Hf(y).
(iii) Mg,p acts transitively on the set of isotopy classes of simple closed curves of the same type (separating/non-separating) and the set of isotopy classes of simple closed arcs.
Proof. The first assertion is proved in [12, Section 3.3]. By definition, a half twist along an arc acts non-trivially only in a neighbourhood of the arc. We can always choose the neighbourhood such that it does not interest any boundary or a puncture. Then, the same argument as in assertion (i) proves assertion (ii) as well. The third assertion for curves follows from [12, Section 1.3.1] and for arcs follows from [12, Section 1.3.3].
By Lemma 5.3, the set of all Dehn twists along non-separating simple closed curves forms one conjugacy class in Mg,p, whereas the set of all half twists along simple closed arcs forms another conjugacy class in Mg,p. If S is a generating set for Mg,p consisting of generators as in Lemma 5.2 together with separating simple closed curves, then Dg,p = SMg,p as sets. Hence, Dg,p has the structure of the Dehn quandle of the group Mg,p with respect to S, and is called the Dehn quandle of the surface Sg,p. Note that Dg,p contains Dgn,sp as a subquandle. To be explicit, by Lemma 5.3(i)-(ii), the quandle operation in Dg,p is given as
x  y = Ty(x) if y is the isotopy class of a simple closed curve, Hy(x) if y is the isotopy class of a simple closed arc.
Further, in view of Lemma 5.3(i)-(ii), the map  becomes an embedding of quandles as
 (x  y) =  (Ay(x)) = AAy(x) = AyAxA-y 1 = Ax  Ay =  (x)   (y),
where A = T or H depending on whether x, y are simple closed curves or closed arcs. The construction of the Dehn quandle of a surface Sg,p for p = 0 first appeared in the work of
Zablow [35, 36]. Further, [20, 34] considered the quandle structure on the set of isotopy classes of

16

NEERAJ K. DHANWANI, HITESH RAUNDAL, AND MAHENDER SINGH

simple closed arcs in Sg,p for p  2, and called it quandle of cords. In general, the quandle of cords is a subquandle of Dg,p. In the case of a disk with n + 1 punctures, this quandle can be identified with the Dehn quandle of the braid group Bn+1 with respect to its standard set of generators, that is, half twists along the cords. A presentation for the quandle of cords of the disk and the 2-sphere is given in [20].
By [12, Section 4.4.4], a generating set for the mapping class group Mg,p for g, p  0 is
{a1, a2, b1, b2, . . . , bg, c1, c2, . . . , cg-1, a12, a23, . . . , a(p-1)p, 12, 23, . . . , (p-1)p},
representatives of which are shown in Figure 2a. A smaller generating set for Mg due to Humphries is {a1, a2, b1, b2, . . . , bg, c1, c2, . . . , cg-1} as shown in Figure 2b.

Proposition 5.4. For g, p  0, the following hold: (i) Dgn,sp is generated by

{a1, a2, b1, b2, . . . , bg, c1, c2, . . . , cg-1, a12, a23, . . . , a(p-1)p, 12, 23, . . . , (p-1)p}.

(iii) Dg is generated by

Here, the generators for Dgn,sp, Dgns and Dg are shown in Figure 2.

Next, we give an alternate and short proof of the main result of [26, Theorem 3.1].

Theorem 5.5. The knot quandle of the trefoil knot is isomorphic to the Dehn quandle of the torus.

Proof. Recall that the trefoil knot K is prime and its knot group is isomorphic to the braid group
B3 = 1, 2 | 121 = 212, . Thus, by Corollary 3.10, we have Q(K) = D(1B3). By [12, Section 3.6.4], we have M1 = a, b | aba = bab, (ab)6 = 1 . Thus, there is a surjective group homomorphism  : B3  M1 given by (1) = a and (2) = b. Further, ker() = (12)6 is contained in the center of B3. Notice that the restriction |: D(1B3)  D(aM1) of  is a surjective
quandle homomorphism. We claim that | is injective, and hence an isomorphism. Suppose that |(1x) = |(1y) for
x, y  B3. This implies that 1x(1-1)y  ker(), and hence

(5.0.1)

1x(1-1)y = (12)6k

for some k  Z. But, notice that 1x(1-1)y = [x, 1][1, y] lies in the commutator subgroup of B3, which consists of words in 1, 2 whose total sum of exponents is zero. In view of (5.0.1), this is possible if and only if k = 0, that is, 1x = 1y. Thus,

Q(K) = D(1B3) = D(aM1) = D1,

as desired.

If a and b are isotopy classes of simple closed curves in an orientable surface, then their geometric intersection number i(a, b) is defined to be the minimal number of intersection points between a representative curve in the class a and a representative curve in the class b. Low order intersection numbers of simple closed curves can be interpreted in terms of relations in Dehn quandles as follows.

Lemma 5.6. If a and b are distinct isotopy classes of simple closed curves, then the following hold:
(i) i(a, b) = 0 if and only if a  b = a and b  a = b, (ii) i(a, b) = 1 if and only if a  b  a = b and b  a  b = a.

Proof. Recall that i(a, b) = 0 if and only if [Ta, Tb] = 1. But the latter relation in terms of the quandle operation is the same as a  b = a and b  a = b. Similarly, i(a, b) = 1 if and only if TaTbTa = TbTaTb. In this case, the latter relation is the same as a  b  a = b and b  a  b = a.
The geometric intersection number completely determines two generated subquandles of Dehn quandles of surfaces.

Proposition 5.7. Let a, b be two distinct elements in Dgns. Then the following hold: (i) If i(a, b) = 0, then a, b is the trivial quandle. (ii) If i(a, b) = 1, then a, b is the knot quandle of the trefoil knot.

18

(iii) If i(a, b)  2, then a, b is the free quandle on two generators.
Proof. By Lemma 5.6(i), i(a, b) = 0 if and only if a  b = a and b  a = b. Thus, the subquandle generated by a, b is the trivial quandle on two elements. Again, by Lemma 5.6(ii), i(a, b) = 1 if and only if a  b  a = b and b  a  b = a. In view of Theorem 5.5, the subquandle generated by a, b is the knot quandle of the trefoil knot. This proves the first two assertions.
For the third assertion, suppose that i(a, b)  2. Recall that Dgns is a subquandle of Conj(Mg). Thus, if there is any non-trivial relation in Dgns involving a and b, then rewriting this relation in terms of conjugation gives a non-trivial relation in Mg involving Ta and Tb. But, by [12, Theorem 3.14], the group generated by Ta and Tb is isomorphic to the free group of rank 2, a contradiction. Hence, a and b generate the free quandle on two generators.
Proposition 5.8. There is an embedding of quandles D1  Dg,p for g  1 and p  0.
Proof. Theorem 5.5 gives D1 = a, b | a  b  a = b, b  a  b = a .
For g  2 and p  0, choose two non-separating simple closed curves x, y in Sg,p such that i(x, y) = 1. Consider the map  : D1  Dg,p given by (a) = x and (b) = y. Then, by Proposition 5.7(ii),  is an isomorphism onto its image.
Theorem 5.5 ([26, Theorem 3.1]) gives a presentation of the Dehn quandle of the torus. In general, the following problem remains open.
Problem 5.9. Find presentations of Dehn quandles of orientable surfaces.
Regarding orderability of Dehn quandles of surfaces, as a consequence of Proposition 4.1, we have
Corollary 5.10. If g  0 and p  3 or g  1 and p is arbitrary, then the Dehn quandle Dgn,sp is neither right nor left orderable.
Remark 5.11. We can define the Dehn quandle of an orientable surface with boundary components in a similar fashion. We have excluded this case to keep our discussions less technical. In fact, most results of this as well as the next section will hold for surfaces with boundary components.

6. Automorphisms of Dehn quandles of orientable surfaces
In this section, we compute automorphism groups of Dehn quandles of surfaces. We say that two simple closed arcs are disjoint if they don't have common end points and also don't intersect anywhere on the surface.
Lemma 6.1. If a and b are non-isotopic simple closed arcs, then the following holds:
(i) a and b are disjoint if and only if a  b = a and b  a = b. (ii) a and b have only one end point in common and do not intersect anywhere on the surface if
and only if a  b  a = b and b  a  b = a.
Proof. By definition of a half twist about a simple closed arc, there exists a twice punctured disk outside which the half twist act trivially. Let Da and Db be such disks for the half twists Ha and Hb, respectively. Let  and  be boundaries of Da and Db, respectively. Then  and  are simple closed curves and it is known that Ha2 = T and Hb2 = T.
We now prove assertion (i). If a and b are disjoint, then we can choose Da and Db such that they do not intersect. Thus, by definition, Ha and Hb commute. In view of Lemma 5.3(ii), we have

DEHN QUANDLES OF GROUPS AND ORIENTABLE SURFACES

HHa(b) = HaHbHa-1 = Hb. Now, by Lemma 5.1(ii), Ha(b) = b, which in quandle operation can be written as b  a = b. Similarly, one can show that a  b = a.
For the converse, assume that a  b = a. This implies that Hb(a) = a, and hence HHb(a) = Ha, which further gives HaHb = HbHa. It follows that T = Ha2 commutes with T = Hb2. Now, Lemma 5.6(i) gives i(, ) = 0. This implies that either  and  are isotopic or disjoint. If  and  are disjoint and not isotopic, then the disks Da and Db are disjoint. This implies that the arcs a and b are disjoint, which is desired. Now, suppose that  and  are isotopic. We choose  in the isotopy class of  and  such that  does not intersect a and b. If a and b lie in different
connected component of Sg,p \ , then a and b are disjoint, and we are done. Now, suppose that
a and b lie in the same connected component of Sg,p \ . Consider the twice punctured disk D which contains both a and b. Since upto isotopy there exists only one simple closed arc in a disk with two punctures, it follows that a and b are isotopic, which is a contradiction. This completes the proof of assertion (i).
Next we consider assertion (ii). Let a and b are simple closed arcs which share exactly one end point and do not intersect anywhere on the surface. Then it is known that HaHbHa = HbHaHb, which can be rewritten as b  a  b = b and a  b  a = b. For converse, we prove that half twists Ha and Hb do not satisfy the braid relation for any other intersection pattern of arcs a and b. We argue case by case for each intersection pattern.
(1) a and b do not share any end point: Since Hb(a) and a have the same set of end points, it follows that HaHb(a) and a also have the same set of end points. Now, if Ha and Hb satisfy the braid relation, then HaHb(a) = b, which implies that a and b have the same set of end points, a contradiction.
(2) a and b share (one or both) end points and i(a, b)  1 on the surface: If Ha and Hb satisfy the braid relation, then HaHb(a) = b. This implies that i(a, b) = i(a, HaHb(a)) = i(a, Hb(a)). But, Figure 3 shows that i(a, Hb(a)) > i(a, b), a contradiction.

Figure 3. Relations amongst half twists
(3) a and b share both end points and i(a, b) = 0 on the surface: If Ha and Hb satisfy the braid relation, then i(a, b) = i(a, HaHb(a)) = i(a, Hb(a)). But Figure 4 shows that i(a, Hb(a)) = 1, a contradiction.
This completes the proof of assertion (ii).
We now determine automorphism groups of Dehn quandles of surfaces.

Lemma 6.2. Let a be a simple closed curve and b a simple closed arc in Sg,p. Then a and b are disjoint in Sg,p if and only if TaHb = HbTa.
Proof. Since both Dehn twists and half twists are defined locally, if a and b are disjoint, then TaHb = HbTa. For the converse, suppose that TaHb = HbTa. Let  be a simple closed curve bounding a regular neighbourhood of b. It follows from the relation TaHb = HbTa that TaT = TTa, where T = Hb2. Consequently, we have i(a, ) = 0. Now, if a and b lie in different components of Sg,p \ , then they are clearly disjoint. And, if a and b lie in the same component of Sg,p \  (which is a disk with two punctures), then a being an essential simple closed curve must be isotopic to . Thus, a and b are disjoint in this case as well.
Theorem 6.3. The following hold: (i) Inn(Dgn,sp) = Mg,p/Z(Mg,p) for all g, p  0. (ii) Inn(Dg,p) = Mg,p/Z(Mg,p) for all g, p  0.
(iii) Aut(Conj(Mg,p)) = Aut(Mg,p) if (g, p) / {(0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)}. (iv) Aut(Dgn,sp) = Inn(Dgn,sp) for all g, p  0. (v) Aut(Dg,p) = Inn(Dg,p) for all g, p  0.
Proof. Since the underlying sets of quandles Dgn,sp and Dg,p generate the group Mg,p, the first two isomorphisms follows from Proposition 3.20. We know from [12, Section 3.4] that Z(Mg,p) = 1 if and only if (g, p) / {(0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)}. The third isomorphism follows from [4, Corollary 1].
We now proceed to prove the last two isomorphisms. We first claim that an automorphism  of Dgn,sp maps closed curves to closed curves and closed arcs to closed arcs. If g = 0 and p  0, then the claim holds trivially since there are no non-separating closed curves. Similarly, the claim holds trivially for g  1 and p = 0, 1 since there are no closed arcs. For g  1 and p  2, a generating set for the quandle Dgn,sp is
S = {a1, a2, b1, b2, . . . , bg, c1, c2, . . . , cg-1, a12, a23, . . . , a(p-1)p, 12, 23, . . . , (p-1)p}
as shown in Figure 2a (see [12, Section 4.4.4]). It is enough to prove our claim for elements of this generating set. We note that no half twist form a braid relation with a Dehn twist. Suppose that there is a closed curve in S such that its image under  is a closed arc. Note that Dehn twists along any two closed curves in S with geometric intersection number one satisfy the braid relation, and the subset of closed curves in S forms a chain. Since  is a quandle homomorphism, it preserves

DEHN QUANDLES OF GROUPS AND ORIENTABLE SURFACES

21

braid relations, and hence maps all closed curves in S onto closed arcs. If p = 2, then half twists about closed arcs (cg-1) and (bg) satisfy the braid relation. Since there are only two punctures, the two arcs (cg-1) and (bg) must have both the end points in common, a contradiction. Now, we assume that p  3. Consider the set {(cg-1), (bg), (a12), (a23)} of closed arcs. Then half twists about arcs (cg-1), (a12) and (a23) mutually commute with each other, which implies that these three arcs are mutually disjoint. At the same time, half twist about each of these three arcs satisfy the braid relation with the half twist about (bg), which implies that each of the three arcs has a common end point with (bg), a contradiction. Hence,  must map closed curves to closed curves. A similar argument shows that  maps closed arcs to closed arcs.
If  is any quandle automorphism of Dgn,sp, then it preserves quandle relations as in lemmas 5.6 and 6.1. Thus, elements of (S) will have the same intersection pattern as of the starting generating set S. In the case g = 0, cutting the punctured 2-sphere along the generating simple closed arcs {12, . . . , (p-1)p} and their images {(12), . . . , ((p-1)p)}, we get two homeomorphic surfaces. Gluing back the boundaries induces an orientation preserving homeomorphism f of the punctured 2-sphere that maps the ordered tuple {(12), . . . , ((p-1)p)} onto {12, . . . , (p-1)p}. For g  1, we appeal to the change of co-ordinates principle [12, Section 1.3.2], which states that any two collections of simple closed curves with the same intersection pattern can be mapped onto each other by an orientation-preserving homeomorphism of the surface. See also [15, Sections 4 and 8]. Thus, there exists a f  Mg,p such that the ordered tuples
(f (a1), f (a2), f (b1), . . . , f (bg), f (c1), . . . , f (cg-1), f (a12), . . . , f (a(p-1)p))
and
(a1, a2, b1, . . . , bg, c1, . . . , cg-1, a12, . . . , a(p-1)p)
are the same. It remains to prove that f (i(i+1)) = i(i+1) for each 1  i  p - 1. Since  and f both preserve intersection patterns of curves and arcs, so does f . Observe that the arc 12 is disjoint from each curve and each arc in S except the curve a12. Thus, f (12) is disjoint from each curve and each arc in S except the curve f (a12) = a12. Cutting the surface along the curves {a1, b1, b2, . . . , bg, c1, c2, . . . , cg-1, a23}, we see that 12 and f (12) both lie in the same subsurface of Sg,p, which is a disk with two punctures. Hence, 12 and f (12) must be isotopic. By a similar argument, for each 2  i  p-2, cutting the surface along the curves {a(i-1)i, bg, a(i+1)(i+2)}, we see that both i(i+1) and f (i(i+1)) lie in a disk with two punctures, and hence are isotopic. Finally, cutting the surface along the curves {a2, b2, . . . , bg, c2, . . . , cg-1, a(p-2)(p-1)}, we see that (p-1)p and f ((p-1)p) lie in a disk with two punctures, and therefore are isomorphic. Thus, it follows that the ordered tuples
(f (a1), f (a2), f (b1), . . . , f (bg), f (c1), . . . , f (cg-1), f (a12), . . . , f (a(p-1)p), f (12), . . . , f ((p-1)p))
and
(a1, a2, b1, . . . , bg, c1, . . . , cg-1, a12, . . . , a(p-1)p, 12, . . . , (p-1)p)
are the same. Thus, f  is identity on the quandle Dgn,sp, and hence  = f -1. Since the center acts trivially on the system of simple closed curves and arcs, we can take f  Mg,p/Z(Mg,p). But Mg,p Z(Mg,p) = Inn(Dgn,sp) by assertion (i), and hence  is an inner automorphism. The last isomorphism follows along similar lines.

As a consequence of Theorem 6.3, we can determine connectivity of Dehn quandles of surfaces.
Proposition 6.4. For g  1 and p  2, Dgns is connected, whereas Dg, Dg,p and Dgn,sp are not connected.

22

NEERAJ K. DHANWANI, HITESH RAUNDAL, AND MAHENDER SINGH

Proof. It is known that given two non-separating simple closed curves a and b on an orientable surface, there is an element f  Inn(Dgns) = Mg/Z(Mg) such that f (a) = b. Hence, Dgns is connected. On the other hand, a non-separating curve cannot be mapped to a separating curve,
and hence Dg is not connected. Similarly, a simple closed curve cannot be mapped to a simple closed arc by a mapping class, and hence Dg,p and Dgn,sp are not connected for p  2.

7. Epimorphisms from Dehn quandles onto homological quandles of surfaces

Recall that an element x of a group G is said to be primitive if there do not exist y  G and

integer k with |k| 2 such that yk = x. Further, if the order of x is finite, then the order of y must

be k times the order of x.

Let Sg be a closed orientable surface of genus g  1. For isotopy classes a and b of transverse, oriented, simple closed curves in Sg, the algebraic intersection number ^i(a, b) is defined as the sum

of the indices of the intersection points of a and b, where an intersection point is of index +1 when

the orientation of the intersection agrees with the orientation of the surface, and is -1 otherwise.

It turns out that ^i(a, b) depends only on the homology classes (and hence isotopy classes) of a

and b.

Recall that H1(Sg, Z) = Z2g

and

H1(Sg, Zn)

=

2g
Zn

for each n  2.

We view elements of

these groups as row vectors. It is known that ^i(-, -) gives a skew-symmetric (in fact, symplectic)

bilinear form on the Z-module H1(Sg, Z) (see [12, Section 6.1.2]). Then, as in [34, Example 4], the

binary operation given by

(7.0.1)

x  y = x + ^i(x, y)y

for x, y  H1(Sg, Z), gives a quandle structure on H1(Sg, Z).
Let Pg denote the set of all primitive elements in H1(Sg, Z) and Pg,n denote the set of all primitive elements in H1(Sg, Zn) for each n  2. If x, y  Pg, then xy  Pg. For, if xy is not primitive, then x = (x  y) -1 y is not primitive, a contradiction. Thus, (Pg, ) is a subquandle of (H1(Sg, Z), ). A similar argument shows that the binary operation

(7.0.2)

x  y = x + ^i(x, y)y (mod n)

defines a quandle structure on H1(Sg, Zn) containing Pg,n as its subquandle. Further, for each n  2, there is a surjective quandle homomorphism n : Pg  Pg,n given by n(x) = x (mod n), the reduction of x modulo n.
Consider the natural action of Z2 = {1, -1} on both Pg and Pg,n. Let us set Pg := Pg/Z2 and Pg,n := Pg,n/Z2. It is clear that the same bilinear form ^i(-, -) gives quandle structures on Pg and Pg,n. Further, n induces a surjective quandle homomorphism n : Pg  Pg,n. We refer the quandles Pg and Pg,n as projective primitive homological quandles of Sg.
It is well-known [12, Chapter 6] that there exists a surjective group homomorphism

 : Mg  Sp(2g, Z)

induced by the action of the mapping classes on the first homology H1(Sg, Z). For each n  2, let

n : Mg  Sp(2g, Zn)

be the composition of  with the reduction modulo n homomorphism. For the isotopy class a of an oriented simple closed curve in Sg, we denote by [a]  H1(Sg, Z) its homology class. The main result of this section is the following.

DEHN QUANDLES OF GROUPS AND ORIENTABLE SURFACES

23

Theorem 7.1. For each g  1 and n  2, there exist surjective quandle homomorphisms
Dgns  Pg
and Dgns  Pg,n.
Proof. Recall that Dgns consists of isotopy classes of unoriented simple closed curves. Thus, for each a  Dgns, there are two choices for the homology class [a]  Pg. We choose [a] such that the entry in its first non-zero coordinate (from left) is positive. By [12, Proposition 6.2], a non-zero element of H1(Sg, Z) is primitive if and only if it is represented by an oriented simple closed curve. Composing the map Dgns  Pg given by a  [a] with the quotient map Pg  Pg, we get a surjective map
 : Dgns  Pg. It remains to show that  is a quandle homomorphism. If a, b  Dgns, then
(a  b) = (Tb(a)) = [Tb(a)] = (Tb)([a])
and (a)  (b) = [a]  [b] = [a] + ^i(a, b)[b].
By [12, Proposition 6.3], we have (Tb)([a]) = [a] + ^i(a, b)[b], and hence  is a quandle homomorphism. Finally, the composition n : Dgns  Pg,n gives the desired second homomorphism.
Corollary 7.2. For each g  1, Dgns has an involutory quandle of size 22g - 1 as its quotient.
Proof. Since each element of H1(Sg, Z2) other than the trivial element is primitive, the assertion follows from Theorem 7.1.
Corollary 7.3. For each g  1, Dg has an involutory quandle of size 22g as its quotient.
Proof. Since each separating simple closed curve represents the trivial element in homology, the result now follows from Theorem 7.1.
Remark 7.4. We make two remarks here.
(i) The definition of Dehn quandle of an orientable surface considered in [34] includes the isotopy class of trivial simple closed curves (non-essential curves). Mapping the isotopy class of trivial curves to a one element trivial quandle disjoint from H1(Sg, Z2) and using Corollary 7.3, we obtain a generalisation of a similar result of Yetter [34, Proposition 23] considering the genus two case.
(ii) The surjection in Corollary 7.2 in fact descends to a surjective quandle homomorphism from (Dgns)2 onto an involutory quandle of size 22g - 1.
Lemma 7.5. If a, b  Dgns and q is a prime, then the following hold: (i) (Ta) = (Tb) if and only if [a] = [b] in Pg. (ii) q(Ta) = q(Tb) if and only if [a] = [b] in Pg,q.
Proof. By [12, Proposition 6.3], we have (Ta)[z] = [z] + ^i(z, a)[a]. Since ^i(z, a) depends only on homology classes of z and a, it follows that if [a] = [b], then (Ta) = (Tb). For the converse, suppose that (Ta) = (Tb). Then [z] + ^i(z, a)[a] = [z] + ^i(z, b)[b], and hence ^i(z, a)[a] = ^i(z, b)[b] for each simple closed curve z in Sg. Choose a simple closed curve z such that ^i(z , b) = 1 (which always exists by the coordinate change principle). This gives [b] = ^i(z , a)[a]. Since b is primitive, it follows that ^i(z , a) = ▒1, and hence [a] = [b] in Pg, which proves assertion (i).

24

NEERAJ K. DHANWANI, HITESH RAUNDAL, AND MAHENDER SINGH

By definition, q(Ta) = (Ta) (mod q). Again, [12, Proposition 6.3] gives q(Ta)[z] = [z] + ^i(z, a)[a] (mod q). If [a] = [b] in Pg,q, then [a] = [b] + qk[v] in Pg for some integer k and [v]  H1(Sg, Z). Since ^i is bilinear, we have ^i(z, a) = ^i(z, b) + qk^i(z, v). This implies that ^i(z, a) = ^i(z, b)
(mod q) for each simple closed curve z, and hence q(Ta) = q(Tb). Conversely, suppose that
q(Ta) = q(Tb). This gives

(7.0.3)

^i(z, a)[a] = ^i(z, b)[b] (mod q)

in Pg,q for each simple closed curve z in Sg. Choosing a curve z such that ^i(z , b) = 1 and using (7.0.3), we get

(7.0.4)

[b] = ^i(z , a)[a] (mod q)

Since [a] and [b] are primitive elements, it follows that ^i(z , a)  ZОq . Substituting [b] = ^i(z , a)[a] (mod q) in (7.0.3), we obtain

(7.0.5)

^i(z, a)[a] = ^i(z , a)2^i(z, a)[a] (mod q)

for each simple closed curve z. By choosing a simple closed curve z such that ^i(z , a) = 1 and using (7.0.5), we get ^i(z , a)2 = 1 (mod q). Since q is prime, ZОq is cyclic, and hence ^i(z , a) = ▒1. Plugging this in (7.0.4) gives [a] = [b] in Pg,q.

We conclude by showing that projective primitive homological quandles are simply Dehn quandles of corresponding symplectic groups.

Proposition 7.6. Let a be a non-separating simple closed curve in Sg, where g  1 and q a prime. Then the following hold:
(i) Pg = D((Ta)Sp(2g,Z)). (ii) Pg,q = D(q(Ta)Sp(2g,Zq)).

Proof. It follows from [12, Proposition 6.2] that each element of Pg is represented by a nonseparating simple closed curve in Sg (without orientation). Define  : Pg  Conj(Sp(2g, Z)) by ([b]) = (Tb) for each [b]  Pg. It follows from Lemma 7.5(i) that  is well-defined and injective. Further,
([a]  [b]) = ([Tb(a)]) = (TTb(a)) = (TbTaTb-1) = (Tb)(Ta)(Tb)-1
and ([a])  ([b]) = (Ta)  (Tb) = (Tb)(Ta)(Tb)-1,
and hence Pg = {(Tb) | b  Dgns}  Conj(Sp(2g, Z)). Since, Dehn twists along any two nonseparating simple closed curves are conjugate in Mg, their images under  are also conjugate in Sp(2g, Z). Further, since Mg is generated by Dgns, it follows that Sp(2g, Z) is generated by {(Tb) | b  Dgns}. Hence, Pg = D((Ta)Sp(2g,Z)) for a non-separating simple closed curve a, which is assertion (i).
Define q : Pg,q  Conj(Sp(2g, Zq)) by q([b]q) = q(Tb) for each [b]q  Pg,q. By Lemma 7.5(ii), p is well-defined and injective. Further, we have
q([a]q  [b]q) = q([Tb(a)]q) = q(TTb(a)) = q(TbTaTb-1) = q(Tb)q(Ta)q(Tb)-1
and q([a]q)  q([b]q) = q(Ta)  q(Tb) = q(Tb)q(Ta)q(Tb)-1.
Thus, Pg,q = {q(Tb) | b  Dgns}  Conj(Sp(2g, Zq)). Since, Dehn twists along two non-separating simple closed curves are conjugate in Mg, their images under q are also conjugate in Sp(2g, Zq).

DEHN QUANDLES OF GROUPS AND ORIENTABLE SURFACES

25

Further, Sp(2g, Zq) is generated by {q(Tb) | b  Dgns} as Mg is generated by Dgns. Thus, we get Pg,q = D(q(Ta)Sp(2g,Zq)) for a non-separating simple closed curve a, which proves assertion
(ii).

8. Involutory quotients of Dehn quandles of surfaces
In this final section, we show that involutory quotients of Dehn quandles of closed orientable surfaces of genus less than four are finite. We denote the involutory quandle of Dgns by (Dgns)2. Further, we consider a different labelling of Humphries generators for ease in proving the main result of this section. By disjointness and braid relations in the mapping class group Mg, we have the following relations in (Dgns)2.

(8.0.1) (8.0.2) (8.0.3) (8.0.4)

ab=a cab=cba
ab=ba caba=cbab

if i(a, b) = 0, if i(a, b) = 0, if i(a, b) = 1, if i(a, b) = 1.

Let c0, c1, . . . , cm be a chain in (Dgns)2, that is, i(cj, cj+1) = 1 and i(cj, ck) = 0 if |j - k|> 1. Let x1, x2, . . . , xn and x be elements in (Dgns)2. Then by (8.0.1) through (8.0.4), we have

(8.0.5) (8.0.6) (8.0.7) (8.0.8) (8.0.9) (8.0.10)

c1  c2  и и и  cm  c0 = c0  c1  c2  и и и  cm c1  c2  и и и  cm = cm  cm-1  и и и  c1
c1  c2  и и и  cm  c1 = c2  c3  и и и  cm c1  c2  и и и  cm  ci = c1  c2  и и и  cm x1  x2  и и и  xn  xn = x1  x2  и и и  xn-1 x1  x2  и и и  xn  x = x1  x2  и и и  xn

if m  1, if m  1, if m  2, if m  3 and 1 < i < m, if n  2, if n  1 and i(xj, x) = 0 for all j.

Lemma 8.1. Let g  3 and a0, a1, . . . , a2g be the generators for (Dgns)2 as in Figure 5c. If x is any element in (Dgns)2, then
(i) x  a3  a2  и и и  am  a4  a3  и и и  am = x  a4  a3  и и и  am  a4  a3  и и и  am+1 for m = 1, 2, 3, and
(ii) x  a5  a6  и и и  an  a4  a5  и и и  an = x  a4  a5  и и и  an  a4  a5  и и и  an-1 for n = 5, 6, . . . , 2g.

Proof. By (8.0.4), we have x  a3  a4  a3 = x  a4  a3  a4, and hence assertion (i) holds for m = 3. Now consider

x  a3  a2  a4  a3  a2 = x  a3  a4  a2  a3  a2 = x  a3  a4  a3  a2  a3 = x  a4  a3  a4  a2  a3 = x  a4  a3  a2  a4  a3

(by 8.0.2) (by 8.0.4) (since x  a3  a4  a3 = x  a4  a3  a4) (by 8.0.2).

Thus, assertion (i) is true for m = 2. Next, consider

x  a3  a2  a1  a4  a3  a2  a1 = x  a3  a2  a4  a3  a1  a2  a1 = x  a3  a2  a4  a3  a2  a1  a2 = x  a4  a3  a2  a4  a3  a1  a2 = x  a4  a3  a2  a1  a4  a3  a2

(by 8.0.2) (by 8.0.4) (since assertion (i) is true for m = 2) (by 8.0.2),

which proves assertion (i) for m = 1. We prove assertion (ii) using induction on n. Clearly x  a5  a4  a5 = x  a4  a5  a4. Thus, the
equality is true for n = 5. Assume that the equality is true for n  5. We prove the equality for n + 1. Let us consider the following:

x  a5  a6  и и и  an+1  a4  a5  и и и  an+1 = x  a5  a6  и и и  an  a4  a5  и и и  an-1  an+1  an  an+1 = x  a5  a6  и и и  an  a4  a5  и и и  an-1  an  an+1  an = x  a5  a6  и и и  an  a4  a5  и и и  an  an+1  an = x  a4  a5  и и и  an  a4  a5  и и и  an-1  an+1  an = x  a4  a5  и и и  an  an+1  a4  a5  и и и  an-1  an = x  a4  a5  и и и  an+1  a4  a5  и и и  an

(by 8.0.2) (by 8.0.4)
(by induction hypothesis) (by 8.0.2)

This shows that the equality holds for n + 1.

Lemma 8.2. Let g  3 and a0, a1, . . . , a2g be the generators for (Dgns)2 as in Figure 5c. Then (i) cm,n  a0  a4  a0 = cm,n  a0  a4, (ii) cm,n  a0  a4  a3  и и и  am = cm,n  a0  a4  a3  и и и  am+1 and
(iii) cm,n  a0  a4  a5  и и и  an = cm,n  a0  a4  a5  и и и  an-1, where cm,n = am  am+1  и и и  an, m = 1, 2, 3 and n = 5, 6, . . . , 2g.
Proof. Using (8.0.4) and (8.0.8), we have

cm,n  a0  a4  a0 = cm,n  a4  a0  a4 = cm,n  a0  a4,
which is assertion (i). For assertion (ii), we have

cm,n  a0  a4  a3  и и и  am = am  am+1  и и и  an  a0  a4  a3  и и и  am = an  an-1  и и и  a5  a4  a3  и и и  am  a0  a4  a3  и и и  am = an  an-1  и и и  a5  a4  a0  a3  a2  и и и  am  a4  a3  и и и  am = an  an-1  и и и  a5  a4  a0  a4  a3  и и и  am  a4  a3  и и и  am+1 = an  an-1  и и и  a5  a0  a4  a0  a3  a2  и и и  am  a4  a3  и и и  am+1 = an  an-1  и и и  a5  a4  a0  a3  a2  и и и  am  a4  a3  и и и  am+1 = an  an-1  и и и  a5  a4  a3  и и и  am  a0  a4  a3  и и и  am+1 = am  am+1  и и и  an  a0  a4  a3  и и и  am+1 = cm,n  a0  a4  a3  и и и  am+1.
Finally, for assertion (iii), we have

(by (8.0.6)) (by (8.0.2)) (by Lemma 8.1) (by (8.0.4)) (by (8.0.10)) (by (8.0.2)) (by (8.0.6))

Lemma 8.3. Let S be a generating set for an involutory quandle Q and X a subset of Q that contains S. If x  s is contained in X for each x  X and s  S, then X = Q.
Proof. Let q be an arbitrary element in Q. We can write q = s1 s2 и и иsk for some s1, s2, . . . , sk  S, since S generates Q. Since S  X and x  s belongs to X for each x  X and each s  S, the elements s1, s1  s2, s1  s2  s3, . . . , s1  s2  и и и  sk belong to X. In particular, the element q = s1  s2  и и и  sk is contained in X, and hence X = Q.
Theorem 8.4. The quandle (Dgns)2 is finite for g = 1, 2, 3.

Proof. One can see that (D1ns)2 = {a0, a1, a0a1}, where a0 and a1 are the generators for (D1ns)2 as in Figure 5a. To show that (D2ns)2 is finite, consider the set X = {am am+1 и и иan | 0  m  n  4}, where a0, a1, . . . , a4 are the generators for (D2ns)2 as in Figure 5b. Using (8.0.5) through (8.0.10), it can be seen that x  ai is contained in X for any x  X and any i = 0, 1, . . . , 4. By Lemma 8.3, we have (D2ns)2 = {am  am+1  и и и  an | 0  m  n  4}.
For g = 3, consider the directed graph 1,6 as in Figure 6. Let f : V (1,6) \ {x0}  (D3ns)2 be defined as f (xi,j) = ai and f (yi,j) = ai for all i and j, where V (1,6) is the set of vertices of 1,6. In Figure 6, the images (under f ) of the vertices are written in squares above or below the vertices.
For m = 1, 2, 3 and n = 5, 6, let m,n be the subgraph of 1,6 obtained by eliminating the vertices yi,j whenever i  {m, n} and also eliminating the branches starting from these vertices. The graphs 1,5, 2,5, 2,6, 3,5 and 3,6 are shown in Figure 7. For v  V (m,n)\{x0}, let x0 = v0, v1, . . . , vk = v be the unique path starting from x0 and ending at v. We associate the vertex v with the element fm,n(v) = cm,n  f (v1)  f (v2)  и и и  f (vk), where cm,n = am  am+1  и и и  an.

We claim that (D3ns)2 is the union of the following sets:
A = {cm,n | 1  m  n  6}, B = B1  B2  B3  B4 and C = C1,5  C1,6  C2,5  C2,6  C3,5  C3,6,
where B1 = {a0}, B2 = {a4  a0}, B3 = {cm,4  a0 | 1  m  3}, B4 = {c4,n  a0 | 5  n  6}, cm,n = am  am+1  и и и  an and Cm,n = {fm,n(v) | v  V (m,n) \ {x0}}. By Lemma 8.3, it is enough to prove that for any x  A  B  C and any i  {0, 1, 2, . . . , 6}, the element x  ai also belongs to A  B  C. To prove this, consider the following cases:

(1) x  A (i.e if x = cm,n for 1  m  n  6): In this case, we have the following.

(a) x  ai  A if m  5 or n  3 or i  {1, 2, . . . , 6} (b) x  ai  B if 1  m  4, n = 4 and i = 0,

(by (8.0.5) through (8.0.10)),

(c) x  ai  B if m = 4, 5  n  6 and i = 0, (d) x  ai = fm,n(x0,1) if m  3, n  5 and i = 0.

(2) x  B: In this case, we have

(a) x  ai = a0  a4 = a4  a0 if x  B1 and i = 4

(by (8.0.3)),

(b) x  ai = a0  ai = a0 if x  B1 and i = 4 (c) x  ai = cm,n  a0  a0 = cm,n if x = cm,n  a0  B2  B3  B4 and i = 0,

(by (8.0.1)),

(d) x  ai = a4  a0  a4 = a0  a4  a4 = a0 if x  B2 and i = 4

(by (8.0.3)),

(e) x  ai = cm,n  a0  a4 = cm,n  a0 if x = cm,n  a0  B3  B4 and i = 4 (by (8.0.4), (8.0.6)

and (8.0.10)),

(f) x  ai  B2  B3 if x  B2  B3 and i  {1, 2, 3, 6}

(by (8.0.1) through (8.0.10)),

(g) x  ai  B2  B4 if x  B2  B4 and i  {1, 2, 5, 6} (h) x  ai = fm,5(x0,1) if x = cm,4  a0  B3 and i = 5

(by (8.0.1) through (8.0.10)), (by (8.0.1) through (8.0.10)),

(i) x  ai = f3,n(x0,1) if x = c4,n  a0  B4 and i = 3

(by (8.0.1) through (8.0.10)).

(3) x  C: Using (8.0.1) through (8.0.10) together with Lemma 8.1 and Lemma 8.2, we have made

a table (see Table 1) containing the products x  ai for x  C and i  {0, 1, 2, . . . , 6}. Consider the following computations as examples.

(a) Let us first consider the product of the element f1,6(x4,3)  C1,6 with a2.

f1,6(x4,3)  a2 = c1,6  a0  a4  a3  a2  a5  a4  a3  a0  a4  a2 = c1,6  a0  a4  a3  a2  a5  a4  a3  a2  a0  a4 = c1,6  a0  a4  a5  a3  a2  a4  a3  a2  a0  a4 = c1,6  a0  a4  a5  a4  a3  a2  a4  a3  a0  a4 = c1,6  a0  a5  a4  a5  a3  a2  a4  a3  a0  a4 = c1,6  a5  a0  a4  a5  a3  a2  a4  a3  a0  a4 = c1,6  a5  a0  a4  a3  a2  a5  a4  a3  a0  a4 = c1,6  a0  a4  a3  a2  a5  a4  a3  a0  a4 = f1,6(x4,3)

(by (8.0.2)) (by (8.0.2)) (by Lemma 8.1) (by (8.0.4)) (by (8.0.2)) (by (8.0.2)) (by (8.0.8))

This product is written at the cell which is the intersection of the row of f1,6(x4,3) with the column of a2. (b) Consider the following product.

f2,6(x0,4)  a2 = c2,6  a0  a4  a3  a5  a4  a0  a2 = c2,6  a0  a4  a3  a2  a5  a4  a0

(by (8.0.2))

By looking at Table 1, the product x  ai is contained in A  B  C for each x  C and each i  {0, 1, 2, . . . , 6}.

This completes the proof of the theorem.
