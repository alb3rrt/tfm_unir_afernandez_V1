## Abstract

This work provides a geometric characterization of the measures $\mu$ in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ with polynomial upper growth of degree $n$ such that the $n$-dimensional Riesz transform $R\mu (x) = \int \frac{x-y}{|x-y|^{n+1}}\,d\mu(y)$ belongs to $L^2(\mu)$. More precisely, it is shown that $$\|R\mu\|_{L^2(\mu)}^2 + \|\mu\|\approx \int\!\!\int_0^\infty \beta_{2,\mu}(x,r)^2\,\frac{\mu(B(x,r))}{r^n}\,\frac{dr}r\,d\mu(x) + \|\mu\|,$$ where $\beta_{\mu,2}(x,r)^2 = \inf_L \frac1{r^n}\int_{B(x,r)} \left(\frac{dist(y,L)}r\right)^2\,d\mu(y),$ with the infimum taken over all affine $n$-planes $L\subset \mathbb R^{n+1}$. As a corollary, one obtains a characterization of the removable sets for Lipschitz harmonic functions in terms of a metric-geometric potential and one deduces that the class of removable sets for Lipschitz harmonic functions is invariant by bilipschitz mappings.

## Comments

An additional corollary is written in the Introduction. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2106.00303
