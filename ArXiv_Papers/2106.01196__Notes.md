## Abstract

Floods have repeatedly battered the South Indian state, Kerala, as a result of extremely anomalous rainfall during Boreal Summers, since 2018. Previous studies have seldom adopted a systematic approach to understand the phenomenon responsible for the extreme events. Hence, this study intends to identify this dynamical phenomenon based on spectral methods, and attempts to render a preliminary solution to the problem. The study exposes the presence of westward-propagating high-frequency tropical atmospheric waves of 5-8 days period, which originated from east Indian Ocean or West Pacific and headed towards the east coast of Africa. The wave troughs ensured sufficient moisture availability along its path, causing extreme precipitation over Kerala on the way.
