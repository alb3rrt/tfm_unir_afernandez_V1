## Abstract

According to recent arguments by the author, the conformal field theory (CFT) describing the scaling limit of the integer quantum Hall plateau transition is a deformed level-4 Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model with Riemannian target space inside a complex Lie supergroup GL. After a summary of that proposal and some of its predictions, the leading irrelevant and relevant perturbations of the proposed CFT are discussed. Argued to be marginal, these result in a non-standard renormalization group (RG) flow near criticality, which calls for modified finite-size scaling analysis and may explain the long-standing inability of numerical work to reach agreement on the values of critical exponents. The technique of operator product expansion is used to compute the RG-beta functions up to cubic order in the couplings. The mean value of the dissipative conductance at the RG-fixed point is calculated for a cylinder geometry with any aspect ratio.
