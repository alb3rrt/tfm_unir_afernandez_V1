OBJECTIVE RATES AS COVARIANT DERIVATIVES ON THE MANIFOLD OF RIEMANNIAN METRICS
B. KOLEV AND R. DESMORAT
This work is dedicated to Professor Paul Roug´ee.
Abstract. The subject of so-called objective derivatives (in Continuum Mechanics) has a long history and is somehow controversial. Several works concern the formulation of the correct mathematical definition of what they are really and try to unify them all into one definition (or one family). In this paper, we show, finally, that all of them correspond in fact to covariant derivatives on the infinite dimensional manifold Met(B) of all Riemannian metrics on the body. Moreover, a natural Leibniz rule, which allows to define an objective derivative on contravariant tensor fields given one on covariant tensor fields and vice versa makes the distinction between those of them who are of "Lie type" or of "co-rotational type" useless. We calculate furthermore, for an exhaustive list of objective derivatives found in the literature, the corresponding covariant derivative on Met(B).

1. Introduction
The re-foundation and geometrization of Continuum Mechanics was initiated by C. Truesdell and W. Noll at the beginning of the second half of the 20th century [80, 81]. These authors have formulated a frame independent theory, using in a systematic way, intrinsic notations and defining general axioms ­ among them the principle of objectivity ­ from which soundly derives the finite strain theory. The starting point of this formulation is an abstract manifold of dimension 3 (with boundary) B, called the body, and equipped with a volume form (the mass measure). The usual reference configuration 0 is thus just the choice of a particular embedding of B into the Euclidean space E (which usually represents the unloaded system), while the deformed/actual configuration is an embedding of B into E (which represents the configuration of the system, in equilibrium, after a certain loading has been applied). The geometrization of Continuum Mechanics was continued afterwards, under the impulse of Marsden and Hughes [48], and is still alive today [14, 72, 69, 78, 77, 25, 76, 36, 60, 10, 18, 5, 75, 70]. The possibility to make mechanical calculations (and numerical discretizations in [19, 20]) directly on the body B emerges with the formulation, by Noll [57] and later by Roug´ee [63], of so-called intrinsic stresses, and by the possibility to recast boundary conditions on the abstract manifold B (see Noll's formulation in [59]). In line with Eringen [15], Green and Zerna [28], Benzecri [3], Noll [57, 59], and then Epstein and Segev [14], Roug´ee [63, 65, 66, 67] has furthermore rightly understood the fundamental role played in Continuum Mechanics by the manifold of Riemannian metrics on the body B. This infinite dimensional manifold, noted Met(B), can itself be endowed with a Riemannian structure, in fact an L2-metric. This is well-known in the framework of general relativity, where such a metric (on the manifold of Lorentzian metrics) called the Ebin metric [13] has been introduced and actively studied in [22, 26, 8, 9]. It is perhaps less popular in Continuum Mechanics, and we must recognize Paul Roug´ee [63, 64, 65, 66, 67] as a pioneer for having introduced such a concept in this field.
The objectivity principle (i.e. material frame indifference [61, 56, 80]) is nowadays a cornerstone for the formulation of rate-form constitutive equations for solids and fluids. So called objective time-derivatives (rates) of objective mechanical quantities have been proposed in the literature [86, 35, 61, 79, 27], in order to introduce some kind of elasticity for viscous fluids or to derive computationally efficient formulations of finite strain elasto-(visco-)plasticity [42, 43, 47]. Some extensions to four-dimensional formalism can be found in [68, 62]. Since a lot of objective derivatives are available in the literature, the natural question arose of how to unify them all [32], as well as of better understanding their intrinsic nature [48]. In other words, to clarify the mathematical concept underlined. A fuzzy classification into co-rotational types (generalizing the Green­Naghdi objective rate), and non co-rotational types (of Lie­Olroyd­Truesdell type) was sometimes made but is still unclear. The remaining question was thus to find the underlying rigorous mathematical formulation of the concept that allows to unify them all (and eventually formulate new ones).
Marsden and Hughes [48] did claim that all objective derivatives of the stress tensor were in fact Lie derivatives, or more precisely, linear combinations of Lie derivatives of the (contravariant) stress tensor and of its different covariant and mixed forms (obtained by lowering subscripts thanks to the Euclidean metric). We will show, in this paper, that this claim is false. Xiao and coworkers [82] have then proposed a quite general expression which includes all known co-rotational objective derivatives (but not Fiala's objective rate [17], derived a few years later from Ebin's metric on Met(B)).
If objective rates are not Lie derivative, what are they ? The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that all of them are in fact covariant derivatives on Met(B). This is how the role of the manifold of Riemannian metrics Met(B) becomes important here. Roug´ee [64, 65, 67] was the first to understand that the Jaumann objective rate was in fact a covariant derivative on Met(B). Following this idea, Fiala proposed in [17] a new objective rate, which was formulated as the Riemannian covariant derivative on Met(B) corresponding to Ebin's metric. However, in a recent paper [21], he seems to differentiate two kinds of objective derivatives: one for strains

of covariant derivative type, and one for stresses of Lie type. We don't follow this point of view. We first formulate objective derivatives for strains as covariant derivatives on the tangent bundle T Met(B). Formally, such a covariant derivative induces a covariant derivative on the cotangent bundle T Met(B), which is a space of tensor-distributions. If this covariant derivative preserves tensor-distributions with density, then it induces an objective derivative for stresses. This observation seems to be new. In practice, this happens to be the case for all known objective derivatives.
The aim of the present work is twofold. First, it is to introduce in Continuum Mechanics the manifold Met(B) of Riemannian metrics on the body B and to show that each covariant derivative on Met(B) induces an objective derivative on symmetric second-order covariant tensor fields (strains). Then, using Leibniz rule, we prove that, under certain conditions, this covariant derivative induces also an objective derivative on symmetric second-order contravariant tensor fields (stresses). These conditions are always satisfied when the objective derivative is local (meaning that it depends only on the first jet of the involved variables). Moreover, in that case, we also prove the converse: each local objective derivative derives from a covariant derivative on Met(B).
Finally, we illustrate our general statement by showing how the objective rates of the literature, including Green­Naghdi's rate, Hill's, Marsden­Hughes' and Xiao­Bruhns-Meyers' families, as well as Fiala's rate, interpret this way. Meanwhile, it was necessary to reconsider the very definition of objectivity and precise this concept from the mathematical point of view. Our discourse is focused on Continuum Mechanics but uses rather sophisticated notions from differential geometry (in infinite dimension). For the sake of self-completeness, the essential concepts are recalled in the appendices.
The outline of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we recall the formalism introduced by Noll to model a continuum medium. In this framework, a configuration is represented by an embedding of the body B into the Euclidean space E . In section 3, we recall basic materials and formulas concerning strains and stresses. The manifold of Riemannian metrics Met(B) is introduced in section 4, where all the mathematical concepts associated with it are introduced: the Riemannian structure, covariant derivatives, and the Riemannian exponential mapping. In section 5, we formulate a rigorous mathematical definition of objectivity and illustrate it by examples. Then, in section 6, we extend this formulation to time derivatives and prove that every covariant derivative on Met(B) defines an objective derivative. The converse is proved in section 7, under local hypothesis. Finally in section 8, we show that all objective derivatives from the literature are special occurrences of this geometric formalism. Besides, we have added four appendices to summarize the main mathematical concepts and formulas used in this paper, in order to fix the notations and to be as self-contained as possible.

2. The configuration space in Continuum Mechanics
In Continuum Mechanics, the ambient space E is represented by a 3-dimensional Euclidean affine space. Designating by q the Euclidean metric on E , it is better to consider this space as a Riemannian manifold (E , q) and forget, at first, this affine structure of space. In a pictorial way, we can consider (E , q)1 such as an observer's three-dimensional "laboratory notebook" (or reference system) in which he records his observations, after choosing a unit length (the metric). The material medium is parameterized by a three-dimensional compact and orientable manifold with boundary, noted B, and called the body. This manifold B is equipped with a volume form µ, the mass measure [80].
A configuration of a material medium is represented by an embedding [55, 57] (particles cannot occupy the same point in space) of class C
p : B  E , X  x,
1To be more accurate, the manifold E is not "the space" but the typical fiber, of dimension 3, of a fibered manifold of dimension 4 with a Galilean structure [37, 38, 11].

sometimes referred to as a placement in mechanics. The sub-manifold p = p(B) of E corresponds to a configuration system. The linear tangent map T p : T B  T E will be denoted by
F.

Remark 2.1. It is common to fix a reference configuration

0 = p0(B),

and thus to substitute the body B by a sub-manifold 0 of E . In that case, one uses

 := p  p-0 1,

0  p,

called the transformation [15, 28, 80, 81, 47, 6, 30], rather than p. Its linear tangent map
T  : T 0  T  is traditionally referred to as the transformation gradient and will be denoted by F.

The configuration space in Continuum Mechanics is thus the set, noted Emb(B, E ), of
smooth embeddings of B into E . This set can be endowed with a differential manifold structure of infinite dimension, indeed, an open set of the Fr´echet vector space C(B, E ) [53]. The tangent space to Emb(B, E ) at a point p  Emb(B, E ) is described as follows. Let p(t) be a curve in Emb(B, E ) such that p(0) = p, then (tp)(0) = V is defined as a tangent vector at p. The tangent space at p  Emb(B, E ) is thus the vector space

TpEmb(B, E ) = {V  C(B, T E );   V = p} ,

where V is described by the following diagram:

TBB VTpp/ T</ EE 
We recognize V as a the Lagrangian velocity or a virtual displacement. T Emb(B, E ) is thus the set of virtual displacements [14].

Remark 2.2. Since Emb(B, E ) is an open set of a vector space (it is described by only one chart), its tangent bundle is trivial. Indeed, we have
T Emb(B, E ) = Emb(B, E ) × C(B, E ).

When we specify a path of embeddings p(t), then the Lagrangian velocity at time t, V (t) = tp(t) = pt(t) belongs to the tangent space Tp(t)Emb(B, E ). Be careful, V (t) is not, strictly speaking, a vector field, neither on B, nor on p = p(B)! However, vector fields can be constructed from a curve p(t, X) and its Lagrangian velocity pt(t, X).
· On B, by setting U (t, X) := (T p-1.V )(t, X); · On p = p(B), by setting u(t, x) := (V  p-1)(t, x).
These vector fields, respectively called left Eulerian velocity and right Eulerian velocity play fundamental roles in mechanics. The left Eulerian velocity (defined on the body) is involved in the Eulerian equations of the dynamics of the rigid body [16], while the right Eulerian velocity (defined on space) is involved in fluid mechanics (and also in mechanics of deformable solids). A unified view of these concepts has been proposed by Arnold in an article dedicated to the bicentennial of the Euler equations of the rigid body [1].

Remark 2.3. One of the difficulties in the finite strains theory is that some authors work with material variables and others with spatial variables, thus multiplying the definitions of fundamental concepts such as strain rate or strain. Basically, it is not really a problem, as long as one can juggle these sets of variables carefully and rigorously. This is possible, and even easy, provided one masters the mathematical concepts of pull-back and push-forward recalled in Appendix B.

To each embedding p  Emb(B, E ) corresponds a Riemannian metric  = pq  Met(B),

where Met(B) designates the set of all the Riemannian metrics defined on B. Note that the Riemannian curvature of  vanishes when B is of dimension 3 (this is obviously no longer true in shell theory where B is a manifold of dimension 2). A natural question, then, arises. Consider the following mapping N (N like Nash [54])

N : Emb(B, E )  Met(B), p   = pq.

Is this application injective? The answer is negative and the lack of injectivity is easily explained. Let p be an embedding and  = N (p), so given any isometry g  Isom(E , q) and any isometry h  Isom(B, ), we have

(g  p  h)q = hp(gq) = hpq = h = 

and thus

N (g  p  h) = N (p).

Conversely, let us consider two embeddings p and p¯ such as N (p) = N (p¯) = . Then

 := p¯  p-1 : p  p¯
is an isometry. It is therefore the restriction to p of a displacement g  Isom(E , q) such that p¯ = g(p). So we have
p¯ = g  p  h, where h := (p¯)-1  g  p  Isom(B, ). Note, however, that in general, the group of isometries Isom(B, ) is reduced to the identity, which is not the case for the group Isom(E , q), which is a Lie group of dimension 6.

Remark 2.4. Similarly, to each embedding p corresponds a volume form pµ on the configuration p = p(B), which is necessarily proportional to the Riemannian volume form volq on p (the determinant). We have thus the equality
pµ =  volq,
which allows to define the mass density  as a scalar function on the space domain p.

3. Strains and stresses

A motion in Continuum Mechanics corresponds to a curve p(t) in Emb(B, E ) [55, 57] (a path of embeddings). To this motion is associated a Lagrangian velocity

tp(t, X) = V (t, X),

together with right and left Eulerian velocities

u(t, x) = V (t, p-1(t, x)), U (t, X) = (TXp)-1.V (t, X),

and a strain rate, a second-order symmetric covariant tensor field on p

(3.1)

d

:=

1 2

Lu

q,

where Lu is the Lie derivative with respect to the (right) Eulerian velocity u.

Remark 3.1. Traditionally, the strain rate is introduced using its mixed form d := q-1d, which

writes as

d

=

1 2

u + (u)t

,

where u is the covariant derivative of the Eulerian velocity u and (u)t is the transpose

(relative to the metric q, see Appendix A) of the linear operator w  wu. The connection

between these two expressions results from the formula

2d = Lu q = qu + q(u)t = 2qd,

6

B. KOLEV AND R. DESMORAT

which can be deduced from proposition D.7. We have furthermore

d = Du, u = qu,

where the operator

(3.2)

D(X, Y

)

=

1 2

((X (Y

)

+

(Y

)(X ))

is the formal adjoint of the divergence of a second-order symmetric tensor field.

The following result, where t = t, is a direct consequence of theorem C.7.

Theorem 3.2 (Roug´ee, 1980, 1991). Along a deformation path p(t) of embeddings in Emb(B, E ), the Riemannian metric over B, (t) = p(t)q, satisfies the evolution equation

t = 2pd.

Remark 3.3. Setting D := pd and  := pq, we have

D

=

1 2

( U

+

( U )t)

=

D U ,

where U is the left Eulerian velocity, U  = U , and where D is the formal adjoint of the

divergence operator relative to the metric .

Given a reference configuration p0 : B  0, the transformation  writes  = p  p-0 1. Then, the right Cauchy-Green tensor is defined on the reference configuration 0 = p0(B) by

(3.3)

C := q = Fq F = qFtF,

and the left Cauchy-Green tensor, on the deformed configuration p = p(B), by

(3.4)

b := q-1 = Fq-1F = FFtq-1.

Remark 3.4. The Cauchy­Green tensors are related to the metrics  and 0 by p0C = p0q = pq = ,
and pb = pq-1 = p0q-1 = 0-1.

The notion of stress is dual to that of deformation. The most common concept is the one of Cauchy stress tensor , defined on the configuration p = p(B) (a symmetric contravariant tensor field). To this dual concept of deformations is associated a linear functional (which corresponds to the opposite of the virtual work of internal forces)

P(w) = ( : Dw) volq = ( : Dw)  volq,





Dw

=

Lw

q,

where the double-dots means the double contraction (a : b = aijbij), w  T  is an Eulerian virtual velocity, w = qw, and where  := / is the Kirchhoff stress tensor. A geometrical

interpretation of the stresses in terms of virtual work can be found in [14, 71].

This leads us to introduce two stress tensors on the body, the Noll stress tensor [57, 59]

S := p,

and the Roug´ee stress tensor [63, 64]

(3.5)

 := p ,

which are both contravariant and symmetric, and appear naturally when writing down the push-forward of the virtual work of internal forces on the body

P(W ) = (S : DW ) vol = ( : DW ) µ,

where W = pw is a left Eulerian virtual velocity, W  = W , and the operator D has been

defined in remark 3.3.

Remark 3.5. When one works with a reference configuration 0, rather than B, and if we introduce the transformation  = p  p-0 1, then, the second Piola-Kirchhoff tensor S, symmetric and contravariant, is both the pull-back of Kirchhoff stress by  and the push-forward of Roug´ee's stress by p0,
S :=  = p0
It is defined on the reference configuration 0.

4. The manifold of Riemannian metrics
The set Met(B) of all Riemannian metrics defined on B thus acquires some importance in Continuum Mechanics. The reader may refer to the work of Roug´ee [66, 67] (see also [39, 40]) for a geometrical formulation of hyper-elasticity such as a vector field on Met(B), in other words, as a section F : Met(B)  T Met(B) of the tangent vector bundle T Met(B). It turns out that Met(B) is itself a Fr´echet manifold. It is in fact an open convex set of the infinite dimensional vector space (a Fr´echet space but not a Banach space)
(S2T B),
of smooth sections of the vector bundle of covariant symmetric tensors of order two. The tangent space TMet(B) is canonically identified with the vector space (S2T B) and the tangent vector bundle T Met(B) is trivial,
T Met(B) = Met(B) × (S2T B).
The cotangent bundle T Met(B) of Met(B) writes
T Met(B) = Met(B) × (S2T B),
where ((S2T B)) is the space of tensor-distributions, i.e. continuous linear functionals on (S2T B) (with compact support).
Remark 4.1. The general concept of tensor-distributions seems to have been introduced by Lichnerowicz [45] and extends Schwartz distributions from functions to tensor fields. When these tensor fields are covariant and alternate (i.e. differential forms) they are called de Rham's currents. Surprisingly, currents (whose origin comes from physics) have been discovered before Schwartz's distributions and have inspired him to formulate his theory [46].
From the mechanical point of view, an element P of TMet(B) can be interpreted as the virtual work of internal forces. Among this large space of tensor-distributions, there is an important subset of them which write as
P() = ( : )µ,
B
where  is a contravariant second-order tensor field on B and the double-dots means the double contraction. These particular distributions will be called distributions with density.
Remark 4.2. The correct setting for studying these infinite dimensional manifolds of smooth mappings [50] seems to be what is now called convenient calculus [41, 7], and has been extensively studied these last four decades. Thanks to the concept of Fr¨olicher spaces [41] (a more restrictive concept than Diffeology [34], but more adapted to our needs), the definition of differentiability on manifolds of smooth mappings has become, nowadays, less tricky. For instance, it is now possible to overcome some difficulties which were inherent in the theory of Fr´echet spaces. This last category is not nice from the point of view of analysis, because in general the topological dual of a Fr´echet vector space (like TMet(B)) or the space of continuous linear mappings between two Fr´echet vector spaces are not Fr´echet spaces [29]. They are, however, still Fro¨licher spaces [23, 41].

4.1. Weak Riemannian structure on Met(B). The manifold Met(B) of Riemannian metrics can be equipped itself with a natural Riemannian structure, by setting

(4.1)

Gµ (1, 2) := tr(-11-12) µ,
B

1, 2  TMet(B),

where tr(-11-12) = ij1ikkl2jl, in a local coordinate system. This (meta-)metric (4.1) was introduced by Roug´ee [66, 67] and seems well adapted for the geometrical formulation of
Cauchy elasticity in finite strains. For this reason, we will call it the Roug´ee metric.

Remark 4.3. In (4.1), a point X  B being fixed, tr(-1(X)1(X)-1(X)2(X)) corresponds to a scalar product on the finite dimensional space of symmetric matrices and (4.1) can be interpreted as the "mean value" of these scalar products. In several papers in solid mechanics (including Roug´ee's papers) the integral is omitted, and as noted by Fiala [17], this lead to some confusion regarding the problem of on which space the metric is defined. From the mathematical point of view, the geometry associated with this metric is nevertheless somehow pointwise, as emphasized in [7].

In general relativity, where no volume form is defined a priori, one uses a variant of this metric, the Ebin metric [13, 22, 8] defined as

(4.2)

G (1, 2) := tr(-11-12) vol ,
B

1, 2  TMet(B).

where vol is the Riemannian volume associated with the metric .

Remark 4.4. An important property of the Ebin metric is that it is invariant by the diffeomorphism group Diff(B). More specifically:

G (1, 2) = G (1, 2),

  Diff(B).

Contrary to the Ebin metric G, the Roug´ee metric Gµ is not invariant by the diffeomorphism group Diff(B) but only by its subgroup

Diffµ(B) := {  Diff(B); µ = µ} ,

of diffeomorphisms which preserve the volume form µ (the mass measure).

These Riemannian structures on Met(B) are relatively well understood and have been intensively studied [12, 13, 22, 26, 8]. There are, however, important differences between Riemannian geometry on a finite dimensional manifold and on an infinite dimensional manifold. A Riemannian metric G defined on a manifold M (of finite or infinite dimension) induces a mapping
G : T M  T M

which is injective (a metric is, at each point, a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form). If M is of finite dimension this mapping is necessarily bijective but this is no longer necessarily true in infinite dimension. We will then distinguish a strong Riemannian metric (if G is bijective) from a weak Riemannian metric (if G is only injective).
The Roug´ee metric induces a linear injective (but not surjective) mapping
TMet(B)  TMet(B),   Gµ (, ·),
whose range corresponds to distributions with density. In other words, an element P belongs to this range if it writes

P () = ( : )µ, where  = -1-1,
B

for some   TMet(B), defining on the body the Roug´ee stress tensor , according to (3.5), as the density of the distribution P. An elasticity law (in the Cauchy sense) writes thus as

(4.3)

 = -1F ()-1,

where F is a vector field on Met(B). This formula is better understood using the following

diagram

Met(B)

By push-forward on  = p(B), we recover the Cauchy stress tensor

(4.4)

 =  p =  q-1p(F (pq))q-1.

4.2. Riemannian product structure on Met(B). Finally, we will describe a natural Riemannian product structure on (Met(B), Gµ) which has a strong mechanical signification. Note first that Met(B) being an open set of (S2T B), an element   Met(B) can also be seen as
an element of T Met(B) and we can thus consider the mapping

  , Met(B)  T Met(B)

as a section of the tangent vector bundle, i.e. a vector field on Met(B). Therefore, we can write

(4.5)

T Met(B) = C(B)  (C(B)),

where orthogonality refers either to Ebin's metric (4.2), or to Roug´ee's metric (4.1). In both cases, the space (C(B)) writes

(C(B)) =   (S2T B); tr(-1) = 0 ,

and we have the following result.

Lemma 4.5. Let p  Emb(B, E ), k a second-order covariant tensors field on p = p(B) and k = kH + kD,

its decomposition into a spherical part (or hydrostatic part) and a deviator (with respect to the metric q on E ). So, the pull-back of this decomposition

pk = pkH + pkD

corresponds to the orthogonal decomposition

T Met(B) = C(B)  (C(B)).

To this decomposition of the tangent bundle (4.5) corresponds a Riemannian manifold product structure of (Met(B), Gµ). Indeed, let Vol(B) be the set of volume forms on B, which is an open positive cone in 3(B). Given a volume form µ on B, we define the sub-manifold

Metµ(B) := {  Met(B); vol = µ}

of Met(B) and the mapping

µ : Vol(B) × Metµ(B)  Met(B), (, )  (/µ)2/3.

Then, the mapping µ is a Riemannian isometry if we endow Met(B) and its submanifold

Metµ(B) with the Roug´ee metric Gµ, and the manifold Vol(B) with the following Riemannian

metric

Remark 4.6. A similar decomposition exists for the Riemannian manifold (Met(B), G), where

G is the Ebin metric [8], but then, one needs to endow Vol(B) with the following Riemannian

metric

4.3. Covariant derivatives on T Met(B). On a Fr´echet vector space, only the notion of directional derivative (or derivative along a curve) makes sense. On (S2T B), this one is written

(4.6)

t := t(t, X),

where  is a time-dependent tensor field and the partial derivative with respect to t occurs in each (finite dimensional) vector space TX B.
More generally, a covariant derivative on T Met(B) is a linear operator D that associates to
each vector field (t) defined along a curve (t)  Met(B) (i. e.   (t) = (t)), a vector field
Dt defined along (t) and which satisfies the Leibniz rule

Dt(f ) = (tf ) + f Dt(),

for any numeric function f : t  f (t). In particular, t defines a covariant derivative on the vector space (S2T B) which, by
restriction, induces on the open set Met(B) a covariant derivative that can be considered as canonical. Any other covariant derivative on T Met(B) can therefore be written2 as

Dt = t + (t, ),

where
 : T Met(B) × TMet(B)  TMet(B)
is a continuous bilinear operator called the Christoffel operator. It is the analogous, in infinite dimension, of the Christoffel symbols kij in finite dimension.
The Riemannian covariant derivative associated with a metric G on Met(B) is characterized, on one hand, by being compatible with the metric G , i.e.

d dt

G(t)(1(t),

2(t))

=

G(t)(Dt1(t),

2(t))

+

G(t)(1(t),

Dt2(t)),

for any one-parameter family (t)  Met(B) and all vector fields 1(t), 2(t) defined along (t) and, on the other hand, by the fact that it is symmetric, i.e.

Dst(t, s) = Dts(t, s).
for any two-parameters family (t, s)  Met(B), meaning here that (2, 1) = (1, 2). Note, however, that for a weak Riemannian metric, as it is the case with the Riemannian structure on Met(B), only the uniqueness of a symmetric covariant derivative that preserves the metric (Levi-Civita connection) is ensured, but not its existence, a priori.

Theorem 4.7. The Roug´ee metric Gµ defined by (4.1) over Met(B) admits the following unique symmetric covariant derivative compatible with it

(4.7)

Dt

t

-

.

Its curvature is non-null and writes

R(s, t)

=

1 4

[-1t, -1s], -1

,

where the notation [·, ·] means the commutator of two mixed tensors of order two.

The following notable fact can be observed: although the Roug´ee metric explicitly depends on the volume form µ, the associated covariant derivative does not depend on it. This covariant derivative is moreover invariant by the action of the whole diffeomorphism group of Met(B) (whereas the metric is invariant by the diffeomorphisms which preserve the volume form µ). In other words, given a diffeomorphism   Diff(B), a curve  : t  (t) on Met(B) and a curve

2This formula is true in finite dimension, but could be false in infinite dimension even if apparently no counterexample is known [7]. In this paper, we will restrict to covariant derivatives which can be written this way.

D Dt

rather than Dt, to insist on the

dependance on the path , this means that

D () Dt

and thus

 (t, ) =  ( (t, )) .

Remark 4.8. The covariant derivative associated with the Ebin metric (4.2) on Met(B) has been calculated in [26]. It is slightly more complicated and writes

(4.8)

It is also invariant by Diff(B).

4.4. Geodesics and the Riemannian exponential mapping. In Riemannian geometry, geodesics are defined as the extremals of the energy functional

E()

:=

1 2

1
t, t dt.
0

For the Roug´ee metric, they are therefore solutions of the associated Euler-Lagrange equation

Dtt = tt - t-1t = 0.

The crucial observation is that the resolution of this equation is pointwise in nature, partial derivatives (relative to t) are to be understood as derivatives in the finite dimensional vector space S2TX B, where X is fixed. This second-order differential equation recast as
t(-1t) = 0.
Given initial values (0, 0)  Met(B) × (S2T B), and introducing the mixed tensor 0 := 0-10, we, obtain thus
(t) = 0 exp (t0) ,
where here, exp(t0)(X) means the exponential of the linear endomorphism t0(X) of the finite dimensional vector space TXB.
We deduce then the expression of the Riemannian exponential mapping associated with the Roug´ee metric Gµ. It is defined as the time 1 of the geodesic flow (t, 0, ), where (0, ) are the initial data (position­velocity) at time t = 0 of the geodesic (t) = (t, 0, ). So we have
Exp0 () = 0 exp 0-1 .
This exponential mapping is a global diffeomorphism from T0Met(B) onto Met(B) for any 0  Met(B) and provides a global chart for Met(B) by second-order symmetric covariant tensor fields. The proof is similar to that of [8, Proposition 2] (see also [22, 26]). It results essentially from the fact that, given a finite dimensional Euclidean space (V, q), the exponential mapping (understood as the exponential of an endomorphism of a finite dimensional vector space)

is a global diffeomorphism [74].

Remark 4.9. The logarithm of the metric C = q on a reference configuration 0 (right

Cauchy-Green tensor) has been initially introduced by Becker [2] and Hencky [31] (see also [49])

to define the true strain tensor,

E

on the reference configuration 0. It was later successfully used to formulate finite strain elastoplasticity of metallic materials in [52], where the authors have extended to finite strains the

additive decomposition of the total strain E into an elastic strain Ee and a traceless plastic

12

strain Ep. This extended decomposition recasts, in this more general geometric framework3

on Met(B) introduced in [65], thanks to the Riemannian logarithm Log0 (the inverse of the Riemannian exponential mapping Exp0), as

E

,

and thus

E = Ee + Ep,

Ee = p0Ee, Ep = p0Ep,

where tr(0-1Ep) = p0 tr(q-1Ep) = 0.

4.5. Covariant derivatives on T Met(B). Recall that the cotangent vector space TMet(B) is a space of tensor-distributions, i.e. continuous linear functionals over the space of the vir-

tual deformation fields TMet(B). Any covariant derivative on T Met(B) formally induces a covariant derivative on the cotangent bundle T Met(B), thanks to the Leibniz rule, defined by

(4.9)

(DtP)() = t(P()) - P (Dt) ,

for any covector field P and any vector field  defined along a curve (t)  Met(B). When P is a distribution with density, that is when

P() = ( : )µ,
B
where  is a symmetric second-order contravariant tensor field on B, we get

(DtP)() = (t :  -  : (t, )) µ.
B
Note, however, that DtP may not be a distribution with density, because it is not at all obvious that the expression
t :  -  : (t, )
can be recast as the contraction of some contravariant tensor field with . If this is the case (for all ,  and ), we then denote this contravariant tensor field (density) by Dt, and write

DtP() = (Dt : ) µ.
B
In that case, we say that the covariant derivative D preserves distributions with densities, and we have the Leibniz rule
Dt :  +  : Dt = t ( : ) .

Remark 4.10. This is always the case when (t, ) depends only on  through its 0-jets, which means that (t, )(X) depends only on (X), and we will write then

(t, )(X) = (t, (X)).
Indeed, there is a natural local duality pairing between tensors (X)  S2TXB and (X)  S2TX B, which writes
(X) : (X).

Using this duality, the adjoint of the linear operator

S2TX B  S2TX B, (X)  (t, )(X) = (t, (X)),

denoted by (t, )(X), is defined implicitly by

(4.10)

(X) : (t, (X)) = (t, (X)) : (X).

In that case, we get immediately

Dt = t -  (t, ).

3This formulation does not requires the introduction of the decomposition RU .

5. General covariance ­ Material frame indifference ­ Objectivity

Classical mechanics is a belief system: each one of us believes that we live, at any given time, in a 3-dimensional oriented Euclidean affine space and that we have an absolute time. These assumptions seem to be confirmed by experience in a good approximation, at least on a daily scale. Paraphrasing Jean-Marie Souriau [74], our clocks are theoretically synchronous and we expect that, whatever the fate of each of us, they will indicate the same time at each of our meetings and by extension that time will be the same everywhere. Likewise, spatial length seems to make absolute sense. The Newtonian universe is therefore modeled by a threedimensional Euclidean space E and an absolute time's arrow T . The choice of a time's unit and of an orthonormal space frame thus makes it possible to locate any event of the universe by a quadruplet of real numbers (t, x, y, z) which are the coordinates of this event in this frame and which will be written in a more condensed way in the form (t, x). Therefore, it is traditionally assumed that a change of observer leads to a transformation
(t¯, x¯) = (t + t0, g(t)x),
where g(t)x = Q(t)x + c(t)
is a path of Euclidean isometries of space E , with Q(t)  SO(3) and c(t)  R3. The notion of objectivity or material indifference in modern language, although often confused
and controversial in the mechanical literature, seems to go back to the work of Oldroyd [61] and the famous treatise of Truesdell and Noll [80], which sought to formulate principles of covariance that had to be respected by constitutive laws. We will not enter into the debate on the merits of these hypotheses here [85, 84], but we will seek to clarify the mathematical definition of the concept of objectivity. To do so, we will introduce the following notation. Given a path of embeddings p := (p(t)) and a path of space's diffeomorphisms  := ((t)), we set

(  p)(t) := (t)  p(t),
where (t)  Diff(E ) and p(t)  Emb(E ). In order to define rigorously objectivity, we are lead to formulate the following definition.

Definition 5.1. A material tensor field is a mapping F : p  tp which, to any path of embeddings p := (p(t)), associates a tensor field tp = (tp(t)), depending on time t and defined, at each time t, on p(t) := p(t)(B).
Remark 5.2. In more rigorous mathematical language, the mapping F corresponds to a section along a path p (see Appendix D) of the vector bundle

E=

Ep,

pEmb(B,E )

where Ep := C(p, T)
is the vector space of tensor fields of a given type T (a vector space of tensors on R3) on E
but defined a priori only on p. This (infinite dimensional) vector bundle has two natural trivializations. The first one writes

(5.1)

1 : E  Emb(B, E ) × C(B, T), tp  (p, tp  p)

and the second one is given by

(5.2)

2 : E  Emb(B, E ) × (T(B)), tp  (p, ptp),

where T(B) is the (finite dimensional) vector bundle of tensors of type T over B.

Definition 5.3. Let F : p  tp be a material tensor field. Then, we say that (1) F is objective if tgp(t) = g(t) tp(t), for any path of embeddings p and any path of Euclidean isometries g := (g(t)) of E ;

14

B. KOLEV AND R. DESMORAT

(2) F is general covariant if tp(t) = (t) tp(t),
for any path of embeddings p and any path of diffeomorphisms  := ((t)) of E .
Here, g(t) and (t) mean the push-forward by g(t) or (t) (see Appendix D).

It is obvious that any general covariant mapping F is also objective, but the converse is not true.

Remark 5.4. Objectivity (or general covariance) translates into equivariant properties of sections along a path of the vector bundle E (see Appendix B).

Let us illustrate this concept with two classical examples [48, 30, 5]. Let F : p  up be the mapping which, to any path of embeddings p, associates its (right) Eulerian velocity

up(t) := (tp)  p(t)-1,

which is a vector field on p(t). We have then

ugp(t) = g(t)up(t) + w(t),

where w(t) := (tg)  g(t)-1 is the drive velocity and g(t)up(t) is the push-forward of the Eulerian velocity by g(t). Thus, the Eulerian velocity is not objective.
Similarly, the Eulerian velocity gradient transforms as

ugp(t) = Q(t)(up(t))Q(t)t + (t),

where g(t)x = Q(t)x + c(t) and (t) := Qt(t)Q(t)-1 is skew symmetric. The mapping p  up is therefore not objective, but the rate of deformation

is objective, because

dp

:=

1 2

up + (up)t

,

dgp(t)

=

1 2

ugp(t) + (ugp(t))t

=

1 2

Q(t)

up(t) + (up(t))t

Q(t)t = g(t)dp(t),

since (t)t = -(t). It is nevertheless not general covariant.

Example 5.5. Let t be a tensor field defined on E and F (p) = tp, be the restriction of t to the deformed configuration p(t) = p(t)(B) at time t. Then, F is objective, if and only if, gt = t for each isometry g. When t is a scalar function, this implies that it is constant. If t is a
vector field, then t = 0. If t is a field of covariant symmetric second-order tensors, then t = q,
where  is a constant. If t is a field of alternate covariant tensors of order 3, then t = volq is proportional to the canonical Euclidean volume form by a constant.

Example 5.6. Let T be a tensor field defined on B and F (p) = (p(t)T). Then F is general covariant and therefore objective. This is the case, for instance, of the push-forward of the mass measure µ on space. We deduce from this fact, and from the objectivity of volq, the objectivity of the mass density . The mass density is however not general covariant but more than just objective. It is covariant under paths of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of E , that is diffeomorphisms such that volq = volq.

The notion of objectivity (and of general covariance) extends, without difficulty, from tensor
fields to tensor-distributions, i.e. to continuous linear functionals on tensor fields. More precisely,
let Pp be a path of tensor-distributions over the space of symmetric second-order covariant tensor fields and g be a path of Euclidean isometries. We will say that Pp is objective if

Pgp(t) = g(t)Pp(t),

where

(g(t)Pp(t))(k) := Pp(t)(g(t)k),

for any symmetric second-order covariant tensor fields k defined on p(t). This extended defini-

tion allows us to reformulate the following result known as Noll's theorem [58, 80].

Theorem 5.7. The tensor-distribution with density

Pp(k) := p : k volq
p

is objective if and only if the tensor field p is.

Proof. The tensor-distribution Pp is objective if and only if

Pgp(t) = g(t)Pp(t),

which writes

gp(t) : k¯ volq =

p(t) : (g(t)k¯) volq,

p¯(t)

p(t)

for any field k¯ defined on p¯(t), where p¯(t) = g(t)  p(t). But

p(t) : (g(t)k¯) volq = g(t) g(t)p(t) : k¯ volq

since g(t)volq = volq. The objectivity of Pp therefore translates, after using the change of variables formula, into

gp(t) : k¯ volq =

g(t)p(t) : k¯ volq.

p¯(t)

p¯(t)

This being true for any field k¯ defined on p¯, we have the equivalence between

Pgp(t) = g(t)Pp(t)

and which completes the proof.

gp(t) = g(t)p(t),

The next result states that each Cauchy elastic constitutive law as defined by Roug´ee is necessarily objective.
Theorem 5.8. Consider a vector field F : Met(B)  T Met(B) and the corresponding elastic constitutive law in the sense of Roug´ee:  = -1F ()-1. Then the resulting Cauchy elastic law  = p,  = p = (pµ)/volq, where
p = p q-1pF (pq)q-1,
is objective.
Proof. Given a path of embeddings p := (p(t)), we have p = p q-1pq-1,
where p(t) = p(t)F (p(t)q). But (g(t)  p(t))q = p(t)(g(t)q) = p(t)q,
since g(t) is an isometry of q, and hence gp(t) = g(t)p(t). Moreover gp(t)volq = (g(t)  p(t))µ = g(t)(p(t)µ) = (g(t)p(t))volq,
since g(t)volq = volq, and thus gp(t) = g(t)p(t). We get finally p(t) = (g(t)p(t))q-1(g(t)p(t))q-1 = g(t)p(t).

6. Material and objective derivatives

Objectivity has been extended to time derivatives. These objective time derivatives, noted
dp/dt here, are principally used to formulate hypo-elasticity laws on the deformed configuration [35, 79]. For instance, in solid mechanics, one often writes

(6.1)

dp  dt

= H : de

= H : (d - dp),

dp  dt

ij

=

H ijkldkl

=

H ij kl (dij

-

dpij )

,

where  is the Kirchhoff stress tensor, d is the total strain rate, and where de = d - dp and dp are respectively the elastic and the plastic strain rates. The fourth-order tensor H, called the hypo-elasticity tensor, depends a priori on the state of deformation [4, 73]. In fluid mechanics, a relative elasticity of the fluid medium is introduced by writing for instance [61, 30]:

(6.2)



+



dp  dt

=

2 q-1d q-1,

where  is the dynamic viscosity, and  is the relaxation time. Although the concept of objective time derivative is the subject of an abundant literature
in Continuum Mechanics, it rarely seems to be defined with enough mathematical rigour. In this section, we aim to fill this gap. First, we will formulate the concept of material time derivative on material tensor fields (which has not to be confused with the particle derivative as defined in example 6.2). In mathematical terms, a material time derivative is nothing else than a covariant derivative (along a path) on the vector bundle (of infinite dimension) E defined in remark 5.2. This point of view will be detailed in section 7. However, in order to be more readable by the mechanical community we will introduce the following definition.

Definition 6.1. A material derivative is a linear operator dp/dt acting on the space of material

tensor fields tp, defined along each path of embeddings p : t  p(t), and furthermore satisfying

the Leibniz rule

dp dt

(f

tp)

=

(tf

)tp

+

f

dp dt

(tp),

for each function f : t  f (t).

Example 6.2 (Particle derivative). Perhaps, the best known example of a material derivative is the particle derivative, defined as follows. Let p : t  p(t) be a path of embeddings and tp be a tensor field defined along p. For each time t, tp(t) is a tensor field on p(t), and we will write
t(t, x) := tp(t)(x), x  p(t).
Now, for each particle indexed by X  B, its "history" is described by the curve x~ : t  p(t, X) on E and x~ (t) = u(t, x~(t)), where u is the Eulerian velocity. Then,

t(t) := t(t, x~(t))

is a tensor field in E , defined along the path x~. The particle derivative of t is defined as the pointwise derivative

(6.3)

t := t(t  p)  p-1 = tt + ut,

where  is the canonical derivative on the Euclidean space E .

Remark 6.3. The particle derivative corresponds to the canonical covariant derivative (see remark D.3) on the vector bundle E associated with the first trivialization (5.1) Emb(B, E ) ×
C(B, T) described in remark 5.2.

The extension of the concept of objectivity for material derivatives is naturally obtained by requiring that they transform objective quantities into objective quantities. This leads us to formulate the following definitions. We recall that g  p = ((t)  p(t)).

OBJECTIVE RATES AS COVARIANT DERIVATIVES

Definition 6.4. (1) A material derivative dp/dt is objective if

(t) = g(t)

dp dt

for each path of embeddings p = (p(t)), each path of Euclidean isometries g = (g(t)), and each

dp dt

tp

(t) = (t)

dp dt

tp

(t),

for each path of embeddings p = (p(t)), each path of diffeomorphisms  = ((t)) of space, and each material tensor field tp defined along p.

Example 6.5 (Non-objectivity of the particle derivative). The particle derivative defined by (6.3)
is not objective. Indeed, if g  p = (g(t)  p(t)), its Eulerian velocity writes u¯ = gu + w, where u is the Eulerian velocity of the path p = (p(t)) and w := tg  g-1 is the drive velocity. We get thus, thanks to remark C.6,

which is not equal to

dgp dt

(gt)

=

g

tt + ut + gwt - Lgw t

,

g

dp t dt

= g (tt + ut) .

Example 6.6 (General covariance of the Lie derivative). Another example of material time derivative is given by

(6.6)

dp t dt

=


t

Lu

t.

This one is not only objective but also general covariant [48]. Indeed

dp dt

=

t(t)

+

Lu¯ ( t).

where u¯ is the Eulerian velocity of the path of embeddings p = ((t)p(t)). But u¯ = u+w, where w := t  -1 is the drive velocity. We get thus (by remark C.6 and lemma C.4)

The material derivative t defined by (6.6) corresponds to the canonical covariant deriva-
tive (see remark D.3) on the vector bundle E associated with the second trivialization (5.2) Emb(B, E ) × (T(B)) described in remark 5.2. It can thus be recast using lemma C.7 as

(6.7)

dp t dt

:=

p

(t(pt))

,

which allows us for the following fundamental observation: When symmetric second-order co-

variant tensor fields are involved, formula (6.7) can be interpreted as the push-forward on the

deformed configuration of the canonical covariant derivative (4.6) on T Met(B), the manifold

of Riemannian metrics. As there is no reason to limit this interpretation to the canonical co-

variant derivative on T Met(B), this gives us the possibility to produce this way, an infinity of

material time derivatives for second-order covariant tensor fields. As detailed in subsection 4.3,

any covariant derivative on

T Met(B) = Met(B) × (S2T B)

writes

Dt = t + (t, ),

18

B. KOLEV AND R. DESMORAT

where  is a bilinear operator that depends on . We then define a material time derivative on second-order covariant tensor fields, by setting

(6.8)

dp k dt

:=

p

(Dt(pk))

=

p

(t(pk))

+

p

pq(t(pq), pk)

,

where p = (p(t)) is a path of embeddings, u its Eulerian velocity, and k is a tensor field defined along p.

Theorem 6.7. Let D be a covariant derivative on T Met(B). Then, the material time derivative on symmetric second-order covariant tensor fields k induced by D and given by (6.8) is objective.

Remark 6.8. It should be noted, however, that these objective material derivatives have no reason to be, in general, covariant with respect to a non-rigid motion of space.

Proof. We already know that

k = p (t(pk)) = tt + Lu k
is an objective time derivative (and is even general covariant, see example 6.6), so we only need to show that
(g  p) (gp)q(t((g  p)q), (g  p)(gk)) = g p pq(t(pq), pk) ,
but this is true since (g  p) = gp, (g  p) = pg,
and (g  p)q = pq, regardless of the path g of Euclidean isometries in E .

Theorem 6.7 extends to second-order contravariant tensor fields, when the covariant derivative D induced on T Met(B) (by Leibniz rule) preserves distributions with density. Indeed, in that
case, an operator Dt has been introduced for symmetric second-order contravariant tensor fields  on B (see subsection 4.3), which is defined implicitly by the relation

Dt :  +  : Dt = t ( : ) .

This allows to define a material time derivative on second-order contravariant tensor fields, by setting

(6.9)

dp  dt

:= p (Dt(p )) ,

where p = (p(t)) is a path of embeddings, u is its Eulerian velocity, and  is a tensor field defined along p. In that case, we have the following pseudo-Leibniz rule between objective derivatives of covariant and contravariant symmetric second-order tensor fields, induced by the same covariant derivative D on Met(B),

which writes

where Dt is defined implicitly by the rule

for all second-order covariant tensor fields  on B and all second-order contravariant tensor fields  on B.

dgp (g ) dt

,

for all symmetric second-order contravariant vector fields  , defined along p. By virtue of (6.10) and the general covariance of the material derivative

p (t(p( : k))) = t( : k) + Lu( : k),

we have

dgp dt

Distributions with density in TMet(B) could have been formulated using the Riemannian volume vol, rather than the mass measure µ. In other words, writing
P() = (S : )vol,
B
instead of
P() = ( : )µ,
B
with µ =  vol,  = p(), S := p (the Noll stress tensor) and  := p (the Roug´ee stress tensor). Note that each covariant derivative D on T Met(B), which preserves distributions with density relative to the mass measure µ, preserves also distributions with density relative to the volume measure vol, and vice versa. Moreover, we have expression (6.11) for Dt, while we have

(6.12)

DtS

:=

DtS

+

1 2

tr(-1t) S,

for all second-order contravariant tensor fields S defined on B. If one prefers to keep the definition of a distribution with density relatively to the mass measure µ, then expression (6.12) corresponds to the following covariant derivative on T Met(B)

Dt

:=

Dt

-

1 2

tr( -1 t ),

and DtS :  + S : D¯t = t (S : ) .

From these observations, we deduce that for each covariant derivative D on T Met(B), which preserves distributions with density, we obtain two objective material derivatives on symmetric contravariant second-order tensor fields. The first one writes

7. A converse theorem for local objective derivatives

So far, we have proved, that each covariant derivative on T Met(B) induces an objective derivative on symmetric second-order tensor fields. More precisely, given any covariant derivative D on T Met(B), it induces a material time derivative

dp kp dt

= p

Dt(pkp)

,

on symmetric covariant second-order tensor fields kp defined along a path of embeddings p. This material time derivative is moreover objective (theorem 6.7), which means that

dgp dt

kgp

(t) = g(t)

dp dt

kp

(t),

for each path of Euclidean isometries g = (g(t)). This covariant derivative on T Met(B) induces moreover a covariant derivative on T Met(B), using the Leibniz rule, and if it preserves distri-
butions with densities (which is in practice always the case), it induces an objective derivative
on symmetric contravariant second-order tensor fields

dp p dt

= p

Dt(pp)

.

But what about the converse? In other words, given an objective material time derivative on symmetric second-order covariant tensor fields, is it always induced by a covariant derivative on T Met(B)? At this level of generality, it is highly improbable that the converse is true. One argument in favor of this claim is that the Nash mapping

N : Emb(B, E )  Met(B), p   = pq

is far from being surjective, all metrics  in its range having vanishing curvature. The question is thus, are we able to describe all known objective rates by a covariant derivative on T Met(B)? To answer this question, we have first to formulate the problem accurately. This will lead us to prove a partial ­ but fully mechanistic ­ converse of theorem 6.7.
As we have already stated, each material time derivative ­ therefore each objective derivative ­ is in fact a covariant derivative D on the vector bundle E described in remark 5.2. Consider now the special case, where the tensor type T = S2R3 is chosen to be the vector space of symmetric covariant second-order tensors on R3. This vector bundle E, with base space Emb(B, E ), is thus the union of vector spaces, noted Ep = C(p, S2R3), of symmetric covariant secondorder tensor fields defined on p = p(B). On this vector bundle, there is a preferred covariant

derivative (see remark D.3 and remark 5.2), the canonical covariant derivative associated with the second trivialization

(7.1)

2 : E  Emb(B, E ) × (S2R3),

2(tp) = (p, ptp),

which writes


k := pt(pk) = tk + Lu k,

and corresponds to the Lie rate (or Oldroyd rate, see section 8.1) described in example 6.6.

Why is k preferred? Just because it is general covariant. However, any other material time derivative, for instance the particle derivative k of example 6.2, could have been chosen to fix an "origin" of the affine space of covariant derivatives4 on E. Therefore, with our choice of this

"origin", each covariant derivative on E writes

(7.2)


Dtk = k + p(pt, k),

where k = kp~ is a section of the vector bundle E, defined along the path of embeddings p~, and

p : TpEmb(B, R3) × Ep  Ep, (Vp, kp)  p(Vp, kp)

is a bilinear operator. By the way, the group of diffeomorphisms Diff(E ) acts on E by the formula

  kp := kp,
which is a vector bundle isomorphism, and sends linearly the fiber Ep onto the fiber Ep. The remarkable fact is that, through the second trivialization 2, this action reduces to the trivial action on each fiber. Indeed, we have
  (p, ) := 2(kp) = (  p, (  p)(kp)) = (  p, ),  = pkp.

Therefore, thanks to the fact that Oldroyd's rate k is general covariant, a covariant derivative D on E, written as (7.2), is general covariant (respectively objective), if and only if

(7.3)

(t)p(t)(((t)  p(t))t, k(t)p(t)) = (t)p(t)(pt(t), kp(t)),

for any path  = ((t)) of diffeomorphisms (respectively isometries), any path of embeddings p = (p(t)), and any path of tensor fields kp defined along the path p. Using the second trivialization (7.1), and setting
p(V , ) := pp(V , p),

we can recast condition (7.3) on  as

(7.4)

(t)p(t)(((t)  p(t))t, ) = p(t)(pt(t), ),

for any path  = ((t)) of diffeomorphisms (respectively isometries), any path of embeddings p = (p(t)), and every tensor fields   (S2R3(B)).
Unfortunately, at this level of generality, we have no chance to solve (7.4). However, if we
restrict the class of these operators p(V , ) to the ones which depend only on 1-jets of p and V , and on 0-jets of , then we are able to prove a converse of theorem 6.7. We will call such operators local, since this terminology is consistent with what is usually called a local formulation
of Continuum Mechanics. Therefore, we restrict the problem to operators p(V , ) which are such that

(7.5) where

p(V , )(X) = (p(X),F(X)) ((V (X), Ft(X)), (X)) , X  B,  : (R3 × M3(R)) × (R3 × M3(R)) × S2R3  S2R3

4Indeed, this choice seems to have been implicitly adopted by many authors [32, 82, 83].

22

B. KOLEV AND R. DESMORAT

is a smooth mapping, which is bilinear in the couple of variables (V (X), Ft(X)) and (X). Here, we have implicitly interpreted p and V as vector valued functions with values in R3 and used a chart around X  B, so that

F(X) :=

pi XJ

(X)

,

Ft(X) :=

V X

i J

(X)

,

are interpreted as square matrices of size 3. Besides, we denote by (·)s and (·)a, respectively the symmetric and the skew-symmetric parts of a mixed tensor in the Euclidean space (R3, q).

Lemma 7.1. Let D be a covariant derivative on E as defined by (7.2), and suppose that D is local, meaning that it satisfies (7.5).

(1) If D is general covariant, then,   0. (2) If D is objective, then we have

(7.6) (7.7)

p(V , )(X) = F(X) (FtF-1)s(X), (X) ,

X  B,

where

QF(X) Q(FtF-1)s(X)Q-1, (X) = F(X) (FtF-1)s(X), (X) ,

Q  SO(3).

Proof. The action of a (not necessarily rigid) affine motion (t, x) = P (t)x + c(t) on p, V = pt and  translates (pointwise) on the arguments of , as follows

(7.8)

p(X) = P p(X) + c, F(X) = P F(X),

(7.9)

Ft(X) = P Ft(X) + PtF(X),

and the covariance condition (7.4), as

V (X) = P V (X) + Ptp(X) + ct, (X) = (X),

(7.10) (P p(X)+c,P F(X)) ((P V (X) + Ptp(X) + ct, P Ft(X) + PtF(X)), (X), )
= (p(X),F(X)) ((V (X), Ft(X)), (X)) .
We will first make a change of variables and replace the argument Ft(X) of  by Ft(X)F(X)-1, with
Ft(X)F(X)-1 = P (Ft(X)F(X)-1)P -1 + M, where M = PtP -1. The covariance condition (7.10) recasts then as

(7.11) (P p(X)+c,P F(X)) (P V (X) + Ptp(X) + ct, P (Ft(X)F(X)-1)P -1 + M), (X) =
(p(X),F(X)) (V (X), Ft(X)F(X)-1), (X) .
Assume first that D is general covariant. Then, taking P (t) = I and c(t) = tc0 and evaluating (7.11) at t = 0, we deduce that  does not depend on V (X). Set now P (t) = exp(tM) and c(t) = 0, where M is a fix square matrix of size 3. We conclude, then, evaluating (7.11) at t = 0 that  does not depend on (FtF-1)(X). We have therefore
(p(X),F(X)) (V (X), Ft(X)F(X)-1), (X) = (p(X),F(X)) ((0, 0), (X)) = 0,

and hence,  vanishes, which proves point (1).
Assume now that D is objective and hence that (7.11) holds only when P = Q is a rotation.
Then, the argument above, which shows that  does not depend on V (X), still holds. Taking,
now, Q(t) = exp(t), where  is a skew-symmetric matrix and c(t) = 0, we conclude, as above, that  does not depend on (FtF-1)a(X). Finally, taking Q(t) = I and c(t) = c0 in (7.11), we deduce that  does not depend on p(X). We conclude that  depends only on F(X), (FtF-1)s(X) and (X). Therefore, and with a slight abuse of notations, we will write

p(V , )(X) = F(X) (FtF-1)s(X), (X) := (0,F(X)) (0, (Ft(X)F(X)-1)s), (X) ,

where the invariance condition

(7.12)

QF(X) Q(FtF-1)s(X)Q-1, (X) = F(X) (FtF-1)s(X), (X) ,

holds, for all Q  SO(3). This shows point (2) and ends the proof.

Since its importance, the following obvious corollary of lemma 7.1 will be stated as a theorem.

Theorem 7.2. The Oldroyd objective derivative (Lie derivative) k is the unique local material derivative which is general covariant.

We will now state our expected converse result of theorem 6.7 concerning local objective derivatives.

Theorem 7.3. Let

dp k dt

=


k

+

p(pt, k),

be a local objective derivative on symmetric second-order covariant tensor fields k, as defined

by (6.4) and (7.5). Then, there exists a covariant derivative D on T Met(B), such that

dp k dt

:=

p

(Dt(pk))

.

In other words, an objective derivative on symmetric second-order covariant tensor fields which

depends only on the first jets of p and pt and on zero jets of k is equivalent to a covariant derivative on T Met(B). Moreover, such a derivative on T Met(B) preserves distributions with

densities and is thus also equivalent to an objective derivative on symmetric second-order con-

travariant tensor fields, by the (pseudo) Leibniz rule (6.10).

Remark 7.4. The construction of such a covariant derivative on T Met(B), provided in the proof of theorem 7.3, is constructive and requires (in the most general case, see the examples of sections 8.7 and 8.8) the choice of a reference configuration p0. It writes Dt = t + p0(t, ), where

p0 (t, )(X) = F0U0(X)

1 2

q-1(F0-U0

-1F0-1)(X),

(X)

,

 is defined by (7.6), F0 = T p0, 0 = p0 q and U0 = 0-1 in the Euclidean space (TX B, 0). In some cases (see the examples of sections 8.1 to 8.6), however, when the dependance of F in F is through  = Fq F, rather than F, then, the construction of D is straightforward and does not require the particular choice of a reference configuration p0. These two situations will be illustrated in section 8.

Before providing a proof of theorem 7.3, we will introduce the following lemma which, when
only local formulas are involved, justifies why they can be extended from Riemannian metrics which write  = pq to all Riemannian metrics defined on the body.

Lemma 7.5. Let X0  B. Then, for each metric   Met(B) and each   (S2T B), there exists a path of embedding p = (p(t)), such that

(X0) = (pq)(0, X0), and (X0) = (tpq)(0, X0).

Proof. We need to find a path of embedding p such that, for t = 0 and X = X0, we have (7.13) (X0) = F(X0)q F(X0), and (X0) = Ft(X0)q F(X0) + F(X0)q Ft(X0),

where F(X0) = TX0p(0) and Ft(X0) = TX0pt(0). To do so, fix a reference configuration p0, and set
C := F0(X0)-(X0)F0(X0)-1.

Then, C is a positive definite, symmetric covariant tensor and we claim that a solution of the problem (7.13) is given by the path p(t) = U exp(tA)p0, where U is the unique positive square root of the symmetric endomorphism q-1C and A := C-1D, with

D

:=

1 2

F0(X0

)-

(X0

)F0(X0

)-1

.

Indeed, we have at t = 0

F(X0) = UF0(X0), Ft(X0) = UAF0(X0),

24

B. KOLEV AND R. DESMORAT

and one can check that F(X0)q F(X0) = (X0), and Ft(X0)q F(X0) + F(X0)q Ft(X0) = (X0).

Proof of theorem 7.3. The following construction requires the choice of a reference configuration

p0, and we lemma 7.1

will set  := p  p-0 1. We will first show allows us to build a well-defined bilinear

that the operator

invariance p0(, )

condition (7.7) on on TMet(B) such

 in that

pp0q(t(pq), ) = p(tp, ),

for any path of embeddings p = (p(t)). To do so, we introduce first the polar decomposition of F(X) = (FF-0 1)(X), with F0 = T p0, and hence we write
F(X) = R(X)U(X)F0(X),
where R(X) is a rotation and U(X) is the unique positive square root of F(X)tF(X). Next, we introduce U0(X) := F0(X)-1U(X)F0(X), so that

F(X) = R(X)F0(X)U0(X),

where U0(X) is the unique positive square root of the positive symmetric endomorphism (relative to the metric 0)
0-1(X)(X), where  := pq, and 0 := p0 q.
Now, thanks to theorem 3.2, we have

(FtF-1)s(X) = q-1d(p(X))

=

1 2

q-1(F-

tF-1)(X)

=

1 2

q-1(R-

F0-

U0

-tU0-1

F0-1R-1

)(X)

=

1 2

(Rq-1F0-U0-tU0

-1F0-1R-1)(X)

and by (7.7), we get thus (with Q = R(X)-1)

F(X) (FtF-1)s(X), (X) = F0U0(X)

1 2

q-1

(F0-U0-tU0-1F0-1

)(X),

(X)

.

Therefore, since U0(X) is a function of (X), this allows us to define a bilinear mapping p0(t, ), using the formula

p0(t, )(X) := F0U0(X)

1 2

q-1(F0-

U0

-tU0-1

F0-1)(X),

(X)

.

This mapping p0(, ) is however defined, a priori, only for metrics  on Met(B), which write  = pq and with  = t(pq). By lemma 7.5, for each metric  and each variation , there
exists a path of embedding p, such that

(X) = (pq)(0, X), and (X) = (tpq)(0, X).
This allows us to conclude that this local bilinear mapping p0(, ) extends and is well defined for all metrics  and all variations , and defines a covariant derivative

Dt := t + p0(t, )

on T Met(B). We have moreover by construction

pp0q (t(pq), ) = p(pt, )(X).

To conclude, observe that the corresponding covariant derivative Dt on T Met(B) preserves the distributions with densities because it is local (see remark 4.10).

OBJECTIVE RATES AS COVARIANT DERIVATIVES

25

Finally, we have proved so far that every local objective derivative (on covariant second-order symmetric tensors) derives from a covariant derivative on the space of Riemannian metrics Met(B)

Dt = t + (t, ),

where  is a local bilinear operator which depends smoothly (but in general not linearly on ).

It writes thus

dp kp dt

=


k-

2p (pq(pd, pk)) .

There are two special cases which describe all existing objective derivatives of the literature. The first one is defined by those objective derivatives which do not depend explicitly on p,
which means, more precisely, that there exists a local bilinear operator Bq such that

ppq(pd, pk) = Bq(d, k).

Examples of such objective derivatives are provided in subsections 8.3 to 8.6. The second one depends of the choice of a reference configuration p0. We apply first a change of variables and substitute  := 0-1 to , t := 0-1t to t and write
p0(t, ) := 0 (0t, ).

Then, the second case corresponds to those operators p0 which do not depend explicitly on p, that is when there exists a local bilinear operator Bb such that
ppp0b(pd, pk) = Bb(d, k).

Examples of such objective derivatives are the Green­Naghdi objective rate (subsection 8.7) and, more generally, the Xiao­Bruhns­Meyers family (subsection 8.8).

8. Objective rates in the literature

In this section, we show that all objective derivatives found in the literature are induced by some covariant derivative on T Met(B),

Dt = t + (t, ),
and we produce an explicit formula for each of them. Since all of these objective derivatives are local, they induce not only an objective derivative on second-order symmetric covariant tensor fields but also one on second-order symmetric contravariant tensor fields, using the rule
Dt = t -  (t, ),
where (t, ) is the adjoint of the linear mapping defined in remark 4.10. Moreover, these two operators are linked by the Leibniz rule

Dt :  +  : Dt = t( : ).

Translating this rule on space, rather than on the body, using the change of variables k = p and  = p, we have accordingly the following (pseudo) Leibniz rule for tensor fields defined

on space,

dp  dt

:k+

:

dp k dt

= t(

: k) + Lu(

: k),

where u is the Eulerian velocity of the path p. Finally, we will use the following notations

d

u + (u)t

and indicate that, in this section,  is not related to either the Cauchy or the Kirchhoff stress

tensor, but denotes just a contravariant symmetric second-order tensor field defined on p.

It was Paul Roug´ee [64, 65, 67] who realized, for the first time, that this objective rate corresponds to the covariant derivative associated with the metric Gµ (4.1) on Met(B).

Theorem 8.1 (Roug´ee, 1991). The Zaremba­Jaumann derivative corresponds to the covariant derivative on T Met(B) given by

Dt

8.5. Fiala objective rate. In the same way Roug´ee [64, 65] derived the Zaremba-Jaumann objective rate from the covariant derivative associated with the metric (4.1), Fiala proposed

in [17] a new objective derivative for symmetric second-order covariant tensor fields, which writes

dp k dt

:=

+

1 2

(tr d) k + tr(q-1k) d - tr(dq-1k) q

It derives from the covariant derivative (4.8) associated with Ebin's metric (4.2). Since this

covariant derivative is local, it induces (using pseudo Leibniz rule (6.10)) an objective derivative

for symmetric second-order contravariant tensor fields  , which writes

(8.4)

8.6. Marsden­Hughes objective rates. In [48, Chapter 1, Box 6.1], Marsden and Hughes
claimed that all objective rates of second-order tensor fields are in fact Lie derivatives. More precisely, they defined the following basic objective rates5 and asserted that each objective rate
of a contravariant symmetric second-order tensor is a linear combination of such derivatives and
of the variant explained in remark 6.10,

where  is the mass density. These calculations are done using the formulas of proposition D.7
and the fact that a covariant or a contravariant second-order tensor t is symmetric if and only if t = t.

Remark 8.3. Note that the first objective derivative d1 is just the Oldroyd derivative (subsection 8.1), the second one d2 is the Zaremba­Jaumann derivative (subsection 8.3) and the fourth one d4 is
the Truesdell derivative (subsection 8.2).

These four objective derivatives correspond respectively to the following covariant derivatives on T Met(B):

Dt1 = t,

Dt2

1 2

t-1 + -1t

Dt3 = t - t-1 + -1t ,

tensors, and a mean of them is required in order to build an objective derivative on symmetric contravariant

second-order tensors. This is our second objective derivative d2.

28

B. KOLEV AND R. DESMORAT

These four expressions are not linearly independent. A covariant derivative Dt = t+ (t, ) on T Met(B) is a linear combination of Dt1, Dt2, Dt3, Dt4, if and only if there exists real constants  and  such that
 (t, ) =  t-1 + -1t +  tr(-1t).

Remark 8.4. One will note that Marsden­Hughes objective rates family coincides with Hill's family (8.1)­(8.2).

Furthermore, it is clear that Fiala's objective derivative (subsection 8.5), which corresponds to the covariant derivative (4.8), cannot be written this way. Marsden and Hughes' claim is therefore false. Many more objective rates can be built which are not Lie derivatives, for instance, all those which depend explicitly on the choice of a reference configuration p0.

8.7. Green­Naghdi objective rate. It was introduced in [27], and defined using a reference configuration p0 : B  0. Introducing the transformation  := p  p-0 1, we write F = T  = RU, where R is a rotation and U is the unique positive square root of the mixed right Cauchy-
Green tensor q-1C, where C = Fq F. Then the Green-Naghdi objective rate is defined as

(8.6)

 :=  -   -  ,  := RtR-1.

This objective derivative is local and derives thus from a covariant derivative on T Met(B), according to theorem 7.3. The derivation of this covariant derivative follows the lines of the proof of theorem 7.3 and illustrates its effectiveness.

Theorem 8.5. The Green-Naghdi derivative (8.6) corresponds to the covariant derivative

Dt := t -  U-0 1LU0 -1(0-1t) - U-0 1LU0 -1(0-1t)  

on T Met(B), where U0(X) is the unique positive square root of the positive symmetric endomorphism 0-1 of the Euclidean space (TXB, 0(X)) and

LU0 : Ends(TXB)  Ends(TXB), S  U0S + SU0.

Proof. First, we use the pseudo Leibniz rule (6.10), to derive the corresponding objective derivative on second-order covariant vector fields

Next, using the notations of section 7, we deduce that

p(V, ) = (p( - u)) + p( - u), u = V  p,

and we have to express p( - u)(X) as a function of (X) and t(X) for all X  B, where  = pq is the pull-back of the Euclidean metric q. To do so, observe that

u = (F)tF- 1 = (RtU + RUt)(RU)-1 = RtR-1 + F(U-1Ut)F- 1 =  + (U-1Ut),

and thus that

(8.7)

 - u = -(U-1Ut).

Now, introducing the linear tangent map F0 = T p0 and U0 = p0U, we have U0t = p0Ut, and p( - u) = p0( - u) = -p0(U-1Ut) = -U-0 1U0t.

We have therefore

p(V, ) = - U-0 1U0t - U-0 1U0t  ,

where U20 = 0-1 and U0 U0t + U0t U0 = 0-1t. Finally, we use the fact that the linear mapping

defined on the space Ends(E) of symmetric endomorphisms of an Euclidean space E is invertible if P is positive definite. We conclude that p induces the following well-defined Christoffel operator on T Met(B)
p0(t, ) := - U-0 1LU0 -1(0-1t) - U-0 1LU0 -1(0-1t)  .

Remark 8.6. The Green­Naghdi is another example of an objective derivative which is not a Lie
derivative as defined in subsection 8.6, since it depends explicitly on a reference configuration p0 (through 0 = pq).

k(b) are functions of the fundamental isotropic invariants of b, and b = bq = (q-1)q is the left Cauchy-Green mixed tensor (3.4).

Remark 8.7. This family contains the Jaumann derivative, the Oldroyd­Lie derivative and the Green-Naghdi derivative. It does not, however, contains the objective derivatives (8.4)-(8.5) of Fiala type.

This family of objective derivatives is local and induces thus, by the (pseudo) Leibniz rule, the following objective derivatives on second-order covariant tensor fields k

9. Conclusion
We have enhanced the geometrical framework of Continuum Mechanics, insisting on the role of Met(B), the manifold of Riemannian metrics on B. Working on the body B, an abstract manifold with boundary instead of a configuration embedded in Euclidean space, has forced us to take some care when developing the finite strain theory. We have been led to properly define objectivity/material frame indifference of tensors in a rigorous geometric manner as an equivariant section of a certain (infinite dimensional) vector bundle. In this geometric framework, the objectivity of elasticity laws (in the sense of Roug´ee) becomes a simple theorem and the objective derivatives/rates are interpreted as covariant derivatives on Met(B).
As stated in the introduction, the question ­ clearly formulated by Marsden and Hughes in [48] ­ of the nature of the objective derivatives is not new. It has been initially addressed by classifying them into two categories: "Lie type" and "co-rotational objective rates" (see [83] for a review). In the second case, a natural Leibniz rule is exhibited, which was proved useful for inelasticity thermodynamic formulation [42, 43]. Xiao, Bruhns and Meyers [82] have then derived a rather general expression for co-rotational objective rates. Roug´ee [64, 65, 67] has observed that the Jaumann rate was in fact a covariant derivative on Met(B), the manifold of Riemannian metrics on the body, and Fiala provided thereafter a new objective rate that expresses the same way in [17]. This observation finally proves to be general. Indeed, by theorem 6.7, each covariant derivative on Met(B) induces an objective derivative on covariant symmetric second-order tensor fields, and also on contravariant symmetric second-order tensor fields if it preserves distributions with densities. Conversely, by theorem 7.3, each objective derivative that depends only on first jets of the embedding p and of the Lagrangian velocity V (i.e. that are considered as local from Continuum Mechanics point of view) recasts as a covariant derivative on Met(B). Meanwhile, we have shown that the Oldroyd­Lie rate is the only local objective derivative which is general covariant.
Finally, we have illustrated our work by calculating the expression of the corresponding covariant derivative on Met(B) for all objective derivatives found in the literature, in particular Hill's and Xiao­Bruhns­Meyers' families. Some of them require the choice of a reference configuration and others not. We have furthermore observed that Marsden and Hughes' claim that all the objective rates are linear combinations of Lie derivatives is false.
Appendix A. Second-order tensors and their interpretations
Given a real (finite dimensional) vector space E and denoting its dual by E, we can define four types of second-order tensors on E, which we interpret as bilinear mappings.
(1) b : E × E  R, (x, y)  b(x, y), (2) b : E × E  R, (x, )  b(x, ), (3) b : E × E  R, (, y)  b(, y), (4) b : E × E  R, (, )  b(, ).
To each of these tensors, we associate, using the convention, of that we call the second argument, a linear mapping
(1) b~ : E  E, y  b(·, y), (2) b~ : E  E,   b(·, ), (3) b~ : E  (E) = E, y  b(·, y),

OBJECTIVE RATES AS COVARIANT DERIVATIVES

31

(4) b~ : E  (E) = E,   b(·, ),

and if there is no ambiguity, we will not distinguish between b and b~ and only use the notation b. Given a basis (ei) of E, and denoting its dual basis by (ei), their respective components write (bij ), (bij ), (bij ) and (bij ).
Given two vector spaces E and F , and a linear mapping L : E  F , its adjoint (or dual linear

mapping) is defined as

L : F   E,     L.

Note that (L-1) = (L)-1 and (L1 L2) = L2 L1.

Remark A.1. A second-order covariant, or contravariant, tensor b is symmetric if and only if b = b.

When the spaces E and F are respectively equipped with scalar products, noted qE and qF respectively, the transpose Lt : F  E of a linear mapping L : E  F is defined implicitly by the relation
Lx, y F = x, Lty E .
The following diagram makes clear the relation between L and Lt

and leads to

qE Lt = L qF .

Appendix B. Pull-back and push-forward

The fundamental concept of differential geometry that allows to pass from material variables to spatial variables (and vice versa) are the operations of pull-back and push-forward. For functions, these operations are defined by
pf = f  p (pull-back), pF = F  p-1 (push-forward),
where f  C(, R) and F  C(B, R). For vector fields, the following diagram

TB B

leads immediately to the natural definitions pu = T p-1  u  p (pull-back),
For covector fields, the following diagram

pU = T p  U  p-1 (push-forward).

TA B o T p T E]





 B

p

 /E

leads to the following definitions p = T p    p (pull-back), p = (T p)-1    p-1 (push-forward).
Once these rules are understood, pull-back and push-forward operations can easily be extended to higher-order contravariant, covariant or mixed tensor fields.

32

B. KOLEV AND R. DESMORAT

Remark B.1. Pull-back and push-forward operations are inverse to each other, meaning that p = (p)-1 = (p-1).

In local coordinate systems, (XI ) on B and (xi) on E , where we have set p(X) = x, the linear tangent map T p : T B  T E is represented by the square matrix F defined by

F

i J

=

xi XJ

,

and its dual tangent linear map T p : TxE  TX B, by

(F)I j

=

xj XI

.

We will write F- := (F)-1 = (F-1).

Proposition B.2. For tensor fields of order one or two, we have the following expressions. (1) For contravariant vector fields W = (W I ), w = (wi) , we have

pW = F(W  p-1), pw = F-1(w  p).

(2) For covariant vector fields  = (I ),  = (i), we have

p = F-(  p-1),

p = F(  p).

(3) For second-order covariant tensor fields  = (IJ ), k = (kij), we have p = F-(  p-1)F-1, pk = F(k  p)F.

(4) For second-order contravariant tensor fields  = (IJ ) and  = ( ij ), we have

p = F(  p-1)F,

p = F-1(  p)F-.

(5) For second-order mixed tensor fields T^ = (T^IJ ) and ^t = (t^ij), we have pT^ = F(T^  p-1)F-1, p^t = F-1(^t  p)F.

(6) For second-order mixed tensor fields T = (TIJ ) and t = (tij), we have

pT = F-(T  p-1)F,

pt = F(t  p)F-.

Remark B.3. The push-forward and pull-back operations commute with the contraction between covariant and contravariant tensors. So in particular, we get
(p) · (pW ) = p( · W ), (p) : (p) = p( : ), tr(pT^ ) = p(tr T^ ).

Appendix C. Lie derivative

Given a manifold M , the Lie derivative of a (time-independent) tensor field t  T(M ) corresponds to the infinitesimal version of the pull-back operation.

Definition C.1 (Lie derivative). Let u be a vector field on M and (t) be its flow. Let t be a tensor field on M . One defines the Lie derivative Lu t of the tensor field t with respect to u by

Lu t

:=

 t

(t)t.
t=0

Remark C.2. When t = v is a vector field, we have Lu v = [u, v], where [u, v] is the Lie bracket of the two vector fields u and v.

The next two lemmas are a direct consequence of the fact that

(1  2) = 21.

Lemma C.3. Let u  Vect(M ) be a vector field on M , (t) its flow and t  T(M ), a tensor

field on M . We have:

 t

((t)t)

=

(t)

Lu

t

=

Lu

(t)t.

OBJECTIVE RATES AS COVARIANT DERIVATIVES

33

Lemma C.4. Let u  Vect(M ) be a vector field on M ,  a diffeomorphism and t  T(M ), a tensor field on M . Then:
 Lu t = Lu t.

Corollary C.5. Let u, v  Vect(M ) be vector fields on M and t  T(M ), a tensor field on M . Then:
L[u,v] t = Lu Lv t - Lv Lu t.

Consider now a path of diffeomorphisms  = ((t)) and introduce its Eulerian velocity as u(t) := t  -1,
which is a time-dependent vector field.

Lemma C.6. Let  = ((t)) be a path of diffeomorphism and t be a (time-independent) tensor

field, then

 t

((t)

t)

=

(t)(Lu

t)

and

 t

((t)t)

=

-

Lu((t)t).

The following result extends lemma C.3 when the path of diffeomorphisms  is replaced by a path of embeddings p = (p(t)) from B into E .

Lemma C.7. Let p = (p(t)) be a path of embeddings, u = (tp)  p-1 be its (right) Eulerian velocity and t a tensor field defined along p(t) ( i.e. on p(t) = p(t)(B) and possibly timedependent). Then
t(p(t)t) = p(t) (tt + Lu t) .

Proof. The lemma is true for a function, because t(pf ) = t(f  p) = (tf + uf )  p = (tf + Lu f )  p.
Now we're going to show it for a vector field w. In a local chart, we have (pw)(t, X) = F-1(t, X).w(t, p(t, X)),

by B.2. Thus
t(pw) = t(F-1).(w  p) + F-1.t(w  p) = -(F-1(tF)F-1).(w  p) + F-1.(tw + uw)  p.
But (tF)F-1 = (u)  p and thus t(pw) = F-1.(-wu + tw + uw)  p = F-1.(tw + [u, w])  p = p(tw + Lu w).
We then show the lemma for a covector field . Let W be a time-independent vector field on B and w = pW . We have
t(p)(W ) = t (p)(W ) = t (p)(pw) = t p((w)) = t ((w))  p = p t((w)) + Lu((w)) = p (t)(w) + (tw) + (Lu )(w) + (Lu w) = p(t + Lu )(W ) + (p) t(W ) = p(t + Lu )(W ).
We finally show, in the same way, that the result still holds for any tensor field t, which completes the proof.

Appendix D. Vector bundles and covariant derivatives

The interested reader may consult [24, 44, 51, 48] for complementary points of view on dif-
ferential geometry. Let E be a vector bundle over a manifold M . We denote by (E) the space of smooth sections of E and by k(M, E) the space of k-forms with values in E, in other words, the space of sections of the vector bundle kT M  E (in particular, 0(M, E) = (E)).

Definition D.1 (Covariant derivative). A covariant derivative on vector bundle E over M is a linear operator
 : (E)  1(M, E), s  s,
which satisfies the Leibniz identity.

(f s) = df  s + f s, for any function f  C(M ) and any section s  (E).

Remark D.2. The set of all covariant derivatives defined on a given vector bundle E has an affine structure. Indeed, given two covariant derivatives 1 and 2, the difference 2 - 1 is a section

of the vector bundle

(T M  E)  E.

Hence, this set is well an affine space with associated vector space ((T M  E)  E).

Remark D.3. If a vector bundle E with base manifold M and fiber type E (a vector space) is trivializable, meaning that there exists a vector bundle isomorphism

 : E  M × E, vx  (x, v), then, each section s of E corresponds bijectively to a vector valued function S defined by

S : M  E, x  p2  (s(x)),
where p2 : M × E is the projection onto the second factor. Therefore, there is a canonical covariant derivative associated with this trivialization which is given by
(X s)(x) := -1(x, dxS.X).

Definition D.4 (Curvature). Given a covariant derivative  on a vector bundle E, its curvature
is the mapping R : (E)  2(M, E)

defined by

R(X, Y )s := X Y s - Y X s - [X,Y ]s.

When E = T M is the tangent bundle of a manifold M , we define the torsion of this covariant derivative, by the formula

T (X, Y ) := X Y - Y X - [X, Y ], X, Y  Vect(M ),
which is a mixed tensor field of type (1, 2). The curvature tensor of  is a mixed tensor field of type (1, 3), which writes

R(X, Y )Z = X Y Z - Y X Z - [X,Y ]Z, X, Y, Z  Vect(M ).
Definition D.5. A covariant derivative on the tangent bundle T M of a manifold M is symmetric if its torsion is zero, that is if

vw - wv = [v, w], v, w  Vect(M ), where [v, w] := Lv w is the Lie bracket of the vector fields v and w.

Remark D.6. One can show the existence on any differential manifold M of a covariant derivative. However, there are an infinite number of such derivatives and none of them play a particular role. On the other hand, if a manifold M has a Riemannian metric g, then there is a unique symmetric covariant derivative  such that g = 0 (see for example [24, Theorem 2.51]), this is the Riemannian covariant derivative.

OBJECTIVE RATES AS COVARIANT DERIVATIVES

35

Any covariant derivative on T M induces by the Leibniz rule a covariant derivative on all tensor bundles of M . The link between the Lie derivative and a symmetric covariant derivative is then recalled in the following theorem.

Proposition D.7. Let M be a differential manifold with a symmetric covariant derivative . Then we have the following relations:
(1) Lie derivative of a function f :

Lu f = uf = df.u; (2) Lie derivative of a vector field w = (wi):

Lu w = [u, w] = uw - wu; (3) Lie derivative of a covector field (1-form)  = (i):
Lu  = u + (u); (4) Lie derivative of a second-order covariant tensor field, k = (kij):
Lu k = uk + (u)k + k(u); (5) Lie derivative of a second-order contravariant tensor field,  = ( ij):
Lu  = u - (u) -  (u); (6) Lie derivative of a second-order mixed tensor field, ^t = (t^ij):
Lu ^t = u^t - (u)^t + ^t(u); (7) Lie derivative of a second-order mixed tensor field, t = (tij):
Lu t = ut + (u)t - t(u).

In order to intrinsically define the geodesic equation of a Riemannian manifold, but also the covariant derivative of the Lagrangian velocity, it is necessary to extend the notion of covariant derivative to vector fields (and more generally tensor fields) which are only defined along a mapping f : K  M , between two manifolds K and M . The rigorous formulation of such a definition requires first to introduce the notion of pull-back of a vector bundle [33].

Definition D.8. Let  : E  M be a vector bundle and f : K  M be a smooth mapping. Then the set

f E :=

Ef(k)  E

kK

is a vector bundle above K, referred to as the pull-back by f of the vector bundle E. A section of this bundle is therefore a mapping s : K  E, such as (s(k)) = f (k).

Example D.9. A vector field defined along a curve c : I  M is a curve X : I  T M , such that X(t)  Tc(t)M , for any t  I.

Example D.10. The Lagrangian velocity V (t) : B  T E , at time t, is a section of the pullback bundle p(t)T E .

Proposition D.11. Let  : E  M be a vector bundle, equipped with a covariant derivative  and f : K  M , a smooth mapping. Then, there exists a unique covariant derivative, denoted f , on the vector bundle f E, called the pull-back of , and such that
(f )X (f  s) = f  (T f.X s) ,
for any section s of E and any vector field X on K.

36

B. KOLEV AND R. DESMORAT

Example D.12. Consider the case where K = B, M = E , E = T E is the tangent vector bundle to E and
f =p:B E,
is an embedding of B in E . Consider a local coordinate system (XI ) on B and a local coordinate system (xi) on E , where Christoffel's symbols are written kij. Let V be a section of pT E , i.e. a mapping
V : B  T E , such that (X(X)) = p(X),

then, we have

[(p)XI V

]k

=

XI V

k

Example D.13. Let (M, ) be a Riemannian manifold and  the associated covariant deriva-
tive. Let c : I  M be curve. Then, the pull-back of  by c, usually noted Dt is defined on the vector space of vector fields defined along c. It is characterized by the following properties:

(1) for any function f : I  R,

Dt(f X)(t) = f (t) X(t) + f (t) Dt(X)(t); (2) If X(t) = X~ (c(t)) where X~ is a vector field on M , then

(DtX)(t) = (c(t)X~ )((t)). In a local coordinate system (xi) of M , we have:

(DtX)k = tXk + kij (txi)Xj .

Remark D.14. On an infinite dimensional manifold, equipped with a covariant derivative, the curvature is defined along a parameterized surface c(s, t), and writes

R(s, t)X = DsDtX - DtDsX.
