1 Introduction and main results
Asymptotic variance is a popular criterion to evaluate the performance of Markov processes, and widely used in Markov chain Monte Carlo(see e.g. [1, 5, 19, 20, 24]).
There are numerous studies of the asymptotic variance in the literature. For reversible Markov processes, the asymptotic variance can be presented by a spectral calculation, which brings a lot of applications (see [7, 14, 23] etc.). The comparisons on efficiency of reversible Markov processes, in terms of the asymptotic variance, has been extensively researched(see e.g. [1, 11, 17, 20, 27]). Recently, there are also some comparison results between reversible and non-reversible Markov processes, see e.g. [2, 6, 12, 26] for discretetime Markov chains, and [8, 13, 22] for diffusions. However, the study of the asymptotic variance of non-reversible Markov processes is still a challenge since the lack of spectral theory of non-symmetric operators. Very recently, [11] gives some variational formulas for the asymptotic variance of general discrete-time Markov chains by solving Poisson equation, and obtains some estimates and comparison results of the asymptotic variance.
In this paper we extend the results in [11] to the general Markov process by constructing the weak solution of Poisson equation with the help of the semi-Dirichlet form.
Let X = {Xt}t0 be a positive recurrent (or ergodic) Markov process on a Polish space (S, S), with strongly continuous contraction transition semigroup {Pt}t0 and stationary distribution . Denote L2() by the space of square integrable functions with scalar product (u, v) := S u(x)v(x)(dx) and norm ||u|| = (u, u)1/2. Let L20() be the subspace of functions in L2() with mean-zero, i.e.
L20() = {u  L2() : (u) := u(x)(dx) = 0}. S

Denote (L, D(L)) by the infinitesimal generator induced by {Pt}t0 in L2(). Define a bilinear form associated with L as

E (u, v) = (-Lu, v), u, v  D(L),

and for   0, E(u, v) := E (u, v) + (u, v), u, v  D(L).
Since  is the stationary distribution and Pt is L2-contractive, for any u  D(L),

(u2) - 

E (u, u) = -(uLu) = lim t0

that is, E is non-negative define.

(L, D(L)) is said to satisfy the sector condition if there exists a constant K > 0 such

that

|E (u, v)|  KE (u, u)1/2E (v, v)1/2, for u, v  D(L).

(1.1)

Remarkably, if process X is reversible:

(dx)Pt(x, dy) = (dy)Pt(y, dx), for all t  0, -a.s. x, y  S,

then the sector condition is always true with K = 1 by Cauchy-Schwartz inequality.

Under the sector condition, we can obtain a unique semi-Dirichlet form (E , F ), where

F

the

completion

of

D (L)

to

E

(E 1

see

[18, Chapter 1, Theorem 2.15]) for more details.

We say that the semigroup {Pt}t0 is L2-exponentially ergodic, if there exist constants C, 1 > 0 such that for u  L20(),

Ptu C u e-1t.

It is well known that when process X is reversible, C can be chosen as 1 and (the optimal) 1 is nothing but the spectral gap:

1 = inf{E (u, u) : u  F , (u) = 0 and (u2) = 1}.

(1.2)

Now for f  L20(), we consider the following asymptotic variance for X and f :

2(X, f ) = lim sup E t

(1.3)

Under the L2-exponential ergodicity and the sector condition, our first main result presents a variational formula for the asymptotic variance as follows.

Theorem 1.1. Suppose that the semigroup {Pt}t0 associated with process X is L2exponentially ergodic. Then the limit in (1.3) exists and is finite for f  L20(). If

in addition the associated semi-Dirichlet form (E , F ) satisfies the sector condition, then

for f  L20(),

2/2(X, f ) = inf sup E (u + v, u - v), uMf,1 vMf,0

(1.4)

where Mf, = {u  F : (u, f ) = },  = 0, 1. Particularly, if process X is reversible, then (1.4) is reduced to

2/2(X, f ) = inf E (u, u). uMf,1

(1.5)

Remark 1.2. Gf :=

fixed f and Gf

:=L200()P, tffrodmt

the proof below we are both in F , here

will see that functions Pt is the dual operator

of Pt in L2(). This is a main reason that we need the semi-Dirichlet form (E , F )

in (1.4). However, if the generator L is bounded in L2(), then D(L) = L2(), so

that Gf, Gf  D(L). In this case,

2/2(X, f ) = inf sup ((-L)(u + v), u - v). uL2(), vL2(), (uf )=1 (vf )=0

The proof of this result can be obtained immediately by replacing P - I by L in the proof of [11, Theorem 1.1].

(2) The assumption of the L2-exponential ergodicity of {Pt}t0 is not too strong for nonreversible Markov processes, since [9] gives a geometrically ergodic Markov chain such that the asymptotic variance is infinite for some f  L20().
(3) Variational formula for the asymptotic variance has been studied in [15, Chapter 4]. It is based on a variational formula for positive definite operators in analysis and resolvent equations. Here we obtain a new variational formula.
As a direct application of Theorem 1.1, bound of the mean exit time of the process is obtained. For that, let   S be an open set, denote by  = inf{t  0 : Xt / } the first exit time from  of process X.

Corollary 1.3. Suppose that process X is reversible with L2-exponentially ergodic semi-

group {Pt}t0 and stationary distribution . Let   S be an open set with ()  (0, 1),

then

E 



() 21(c

)

,

where 1 is the spectral gap defined in (1.2).

Note that in [10, Remark 3.6(1)], we gave another upper bound for the mean exit time. Explicitly, E  1/(1(c)) for open set   S satisfying (c) > 0. It is obvious that the upper bound in Corollary 1.3 is more precise than that.
For the reversible case, similar to [11, Theorem 1.3], we could derive variational formula (1.5) without the assumption of the L2-exponential ergodicity. Since the proof is quite
similar, we omit it in this paper.

Theorem 1.4. Suppose that X is a reversible ergodic Markov process with stationary distribution . Then for fixed f  L20(),
2/2(X, f ) = inf E (u, u). uMf,1

Note that in Theorem 1.4, maybe 2(X, f ) =  for some f  L20(). The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we apply our main result in two situations. The first application is extending the comparison result for the asymptotic variance of one dimensional diffusions in [25, Theorem 1] to multidimensional reversible diffusions. We note that [25, Theorem 1] is proved by discrete approximation which is different from our idea, and the less assumptions are requested

3

in our proof. Another application is a comparison result between reversible and nonreversible diffusions on Riemannian Manifolds, which shows the asymptotic variance of a non-reversible diffusion is smaller. The similar result can be found in [8, 13](for example, [13] proves a similar result on compact manifolds by using a spectral theorem), we provide a complete different proof by the new variational formula. Finally, the proofs of Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 1.3 are given in Section 3.

2 Applications

2.1 Reversible diffusions

First, we recall the comparison theorem proved in [25, Theorem 1]. Fix a C1 probability density function µ : [I1, I2]  (0, ), where -  I1 < I2  . Given a C1 positive function  on [I1, I2] and consider a one-dimensional Langevin diffusion:

dXt =  (Xt) dBt +

Under some additional conditions (see [25, Page 133]), [25] proves that for any f  L20(µ), and two C1 positive functions , 1 on [I1, I2] such that 1(x)  (x) for all x  [I1, I2],

2(X1, f )  2(X, f ).

Note that in [25], the above conclusion is proved by discrete approximation. In fact, we

can obtain the above result by a direct calculation as follows. For convenience, we only

consider the case on half-line.

Fix a C1 probability density function  : [0, )  (0, ). Given a C1 positive function

a on [0, ) and consider a one-dimensional diffusion Xa with reflecting boundary 0 and

generator:

La

=

a(x)

d2 dx2

+

b(x)

d dx

,

(2.1)

where b(x) = a(x)((x)/(x)) + a(x). Let (dx) = (x)dx. It is easy to see that La is symmetric on L2(). Choose a point x0 > 0 and set

c(x) =

x x0

b(y) a(y)

dy

and

(x) =

x
e-c(y)dy.
0

So we have

(x) = ec(x)(x0)a(x0)/a(x).

Assume that Xa is non-explosive, that is,

(2.2)


(y)([0, y])dy = ,
0

then X is ergodic with stationary distribution (dx)(see e.g. [4, Table 5.1]).
For fixed function f  L20(), consider Poisson equation -Lau = f . By some direct calculations and (2.2), the equation has strong solution

(2.3)

Using the above representation, we obtain the following comparison theorem directly.

Theorem 2.1. Let a, a1 be two C1 positive function on [0, ). Then Langevin diffusions Xa and Xa1, with generators of form (2.1), possess the same stationary distribution . Moreover, if a  a1, then for any f  L20(),
2(Xa, f )  2(Xa1, f ).

In particular, for fixed f  L20(), 2(Xka, f ) is non-increasing for k  (0, ).
For multi-dimensional reversible diffusion processes, explicit representation (2.3) for the asymptotic variance is difficult to obtain. However, we could use Theorem 1.4 to get the similar comparison result as follows.
Let V  C2(Rd) with Rd eV (x)dx < . Consider the reversible diffusion process XA generated by elliptic operator

Assume that XA is non-explosive. By [21, Theorem 4.2.1], we see that process XA is ergodic with stationary distribution

dx.

Denote by (EA(·, ·), FA) the Dirichlet form associated with the process XA. Explicitly, we see that

EA(u, v) = u · Avd, for u, v  FA := {u  L2() : EA(u, u) < }.

(2.4)

Theorem 2.2. Let V  C2(Rd) with Rd eV (x)dx < , A(x) = (aij(x))1i,jd and A1(x) = (a1ij(x))1i,jd, x  Rd be positive definite matrices satisfying aij, a1ij  C2(Rd) for 1  i, j  d. Suppose that A1  A in the sense that A(x) - A1(x) is non-negative definite for all x  Rd. Then for any f  L20(),

2(XA1, f )  2(XA, f ).

(2.5)

In particular, for fixed f  L20(), 2(XkA, f ) is non-increasing for k  (0, ). Proof. Since A1  A, by (2.4) it is easy to check that FA1  FA and

EA1(u, u)  EA(u, u) for all u  FA. Fix f  L20(). The inequality (2.5) is trivial when 2(XA1, f ) = . Now assume that 2(XA1, f ) < . It follows from Theorem 1.4 that

2/2(XA1, f )

EA1(u, u)

EA(u, u) = 2/2(XA, f ).

Hence, the proof is completed.

2.2 Non-reversible diffusions on Riemannian Manifolds
In this section,we turn to non-reversible case. Let M be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold with empty boundary or convex boundary, and ·, · be the inner product under the Riemannian metric. Denote dx and  by the Riemannian volume and Laplace operator on M, respectively.
Let (dx) := e-U(x)dx be a probability measure on M with potential function U  C2(M). We consider the following diffusion operator:

L =  - U - Z,  ,

(2.6)

where Z is a C1 vector field on M. Denote by L the dual operator of L on L2(): L =  - U + Z,  - (div Z - U, Z ),

where div is the divergence operator. It is well known that  is the invariant measure of L if and only if (L1, ) = 0 for   C0(M), i.e.,

(div Z - U, Z )d = div(Ze-U )dx = 0.

M

M

From now on we assume that

div(Ze-U )  0.

(2.7)

Then by [3, Corollary 3.6], the diffusion X with generator L is ergdoic with stationary distribution .
Denote the symmetric part of L with respect to  by L :=  - U,  . and let X be the diffusion generated by L.

6

Define (E , F ) as the semi-Dirichlet form generated by L, and denote its symmetric part and antisymmetric part by E , E respectively. So from the integration by parts and (2.7), we have

E (, ) = ,  d and E (, ) =  Z,  d ,   C0(M).

M

M

Indeed, it is easy to check that (E , F ) is the Dirichlet form generated by L. We suppose that the following Assumption A holds:

(A1) |U |  |U |2 + CU for some  < 1 and CU  0;

(A2) there is a constant K such that |Z|  K(|U| + 1);

(A3) the symmetric Dirichlet form (E , F ) satisfies the Poincar´e inequality, i.e., there exists a constant 1 > 0 such that
 2  -1 1E (, ) for all   F ,
where · is L2()-norm.
We note that (A3) is equivalent to the L2-exponential ergodicity of semigroup of diffusion X.
Lemma 2.3. If Assumption A and (2.7) hold, then (E , F ) satisfies the sector condition (1.1). Therefore, Theorem 1.1 holds for the diffusion X.
Proof. Since (E , F ) is symmetric, it satisfies the sector condition, we only need to check the sector condition for the antisymmetric part E .
Fix ,   C0(M). By Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and (A2) we have

Z,  d  K (|U| + 1)||d

M

 K ||d + KE (, )1/2 |U | .

(2.8)

For the last term above, the integration by parts on manifold, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality

Now fix  > 0 such that  +  < 1. Combining inequality |xy|  (x2/ + y2) /2 with (2.9) and (A3) we have

Combining this with (2.8) and (A3), we obtain that E satisfies the sector condition on F.

From Lemma 2.3 and Theorem 1.1, we obtain the following comparison result.

Theorem 2.4. Suppose that Assumption A holds. Then for any f  L20(),

2(X, f )  2(X, f ).

Proof. Since the conditions in Theorem 1.1 are satisfied by Lemma 2.3, we obtain by taking v = 0 that

2/2(X, f ) = inf sup E (u + v, u - v) uMf,1 vMf,0

 inf E (u, u) = inf E (u, u) = 2/2(X, f ).

uMf,1

uMf,1

Remark 2.5. Similar comparison result in Theorem 2.4 can be found in [8, 13]. For example, [13] proves the comparison theorem by using a spectral theorem (see [13, Section 3.4.3]). Here we provide a completely different proof by the new variational formula.

Example 2.6. ([16, Example 5.2]) Let M = R2, potential function U (x) = (1/2)e-|x|2/2

and vector field

Z

where c is a positive constant. Consider the 2-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion

with rotation:

Its invariant probability measure is (dx) = (1/2)e-|x|2/2dx. The symmetric part of L

with respect to  is

L :=

Since the symmetric Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion generated by L is exponentially ergodic, (A3) is satisfied. A direct calculation shows that div(Ze-U ) = 0 and (A1), (A2)
are satisfied. Hence, Theorems 1.1 and 2.4 are valid.

3 Proofs of Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 1.3

Recall that X = {Xt}t0 is a positive recurrent (or ergodic) Markov process on a Polish space (S, S), with strongly continuous contraction transition semigroup {Pt}t0 and stationary distribution . (L, D(L)), (E , F ) are its associated infinitesimal generator in L2() and semi-Dirichlet form, respectively. For fixed f  L20(), we want to study the asymptotic variance of X and f defined in (1.3). Indeed, from [15, Section 2.5], we see
that the asymptotic variance can be represented by Pt as follows:

2(X, f ) = 2 lim t

(3.1)

To prove Theorem 1.1, first we do some preparations. For any  > 0, set Gf =

e-sPsf ds

for

f



L2().

From

[18,

Chapter

1,

Proposition

1.10]

we

see

that

(G)>0

is the strong continuous contraction resolvent associated to L and Gf  D(L) for all

f  L2(). If the semigroup {Pt}t0 is L2-exponentially ergodic, then it is known that

Gf :=

 0

Psf

ds



L2()

for

f



L20().

Lemma 3.1. Suppose that the semigroup {Pt}t0 is L2-exponentially ergodic and its corresponding semi-Dirichlet form (E , F ) satisfies the sector condition (1.1). Then for all f  L20(), we have Gf  D(L) and

E (Gf, u) = (f, u), u  F .

Proof. We first prove that Gf  D(L) for all f  L20(). Note that the generator L is closed and densely defined, that is, D(L) is complete with respect to the graph norm
Lu + u , u  D(L) (see e.g. [18, Chapter 1, Proposition 1.10]). Thus for fixed
f  L20(), we only need to prove that G1/nf - Gf  0 as n   and {G1/nf }n1 is a Cauchy sequence under L · by G1/nf  D(L), n  1. Indeed, it follows from L2-exponential ergodicity and H¨older inequality that

G1/nf - Gf

(3.2)

On the other hand, since Lf = ( - G- 1)f for all  > 0 and f  L20(), we have

L(G1/nf - G1/mf )

= (1/n - G-1/1n)G1/nf - (1/m - G-1/1m)G1/mf

Therefore Gf  D(L).

Next we prove that -LGf = f for f  L20(). Arguing similarly as we did in (3.2), lim0 Gf - Gf = 0 for f  L20(). Combining this fact with the property G - G = ( - )GG, we obtain that

Gf - Gf = GGf, for  > 0, f  L20().

Using this equality and the fact Gf  D(L) shows that for any  > 0 and f  L20(),

G(-LGf ) = G(G- 1 - )Gf = Gf - GGf = Gf.

That is, -LGf = f for all f  L20().

From above analysis and [18, Chapter 1, Corollary 2.10] we could obtain that for any

f  L20(), u  F ,

E (Gf, u) = ((-L)Gf, u) = (f, u).

We now proceed to prove Theorem 1.1. Proof of Theorem 1.1. For fixed f  L20(), we first claim that the limit in (1.3), i.e. (3.1), exists and 2(X, f ) = 2(Gf, f ) < . Indeed, for t > 0,

Therefore, by combining above analysis, we obtain that the limit in (3.1) exists and


2(X, f ) = 2 (Psf, f )ds < .

By the Fubini-Tonelli's theorem and L2-exponential ergodicity again we get







(Psf, f )ds =

f Psf dds =

f Psf dsd = (Gf, f ).

S0

Thus

2(X, f ) = 2(Gf, f ) < .

(3.3)

To prove (1.4), we set w = Gf /(Gf, f ), w = Gf /(Gf, f ) and u0 = (w + w)/2, v0 = (w - w)/2. Then u0  Mf,1 and v0  Mf,0 by noting





(Gf, f ) = (Psf, f )ds = (f, Psf )ds = (Gf, f ).

10

Now let v1 = v - v0 for any v  Mf,0. By the definition of w, w, v0 and Lemma 3.1, we have (v1f ) = 0 and

E (v1, w)

=

E

(w, v1)

=

1E (Gf, f )

(Gf, v1)

=

1 (Gf,

f

)

(f

,

v1)

=

0.

Therefore, using this fact with E (w, w) = 1/(Gf, f ) and E (u, u)  0 for all u  F gives that

E (u0 + v, u0 - v) = E (w - v1, w + v1) = E (w, w) - E (v1, v1)  1/(Gf, f ),

which implies that

1/(Gf, f )  inf sup E (u + v, u - v). uMf,1 vMf,0

(3.4)

For the converse inequality, let u1 = u - u0 for any u  Mf,1. Since u0  Mf,1, we also have (u1f ) = 0. Similar argument shows that

E (u + v0, u - v0) = E (w + u1, w + u1) = E (w, w) + E (u1, u1)  1/(Gf, f ).

Therefore,

1/(Gf, f )  inf sup E (u + v, u - v). uMf,1 vMf,0

So we obtain (1.4) by combining (3.4), (3.5) and the fact 2(X, f ) = 2(Gf, f ). When process X is reversible, E (·, ·) is symmetric, i.e.,

(3.5)

E (u, v) = E (v, u), for u, v  F .

Thus

E (u + v, u - v) = E (u, u) - E (v, v)  E (u, u).

That is, the supremum in (1.4) is attained by v = 0 for any fixed u  Mf,1. Hence, we obtain (1.5).
By using Theorem 1.1, we prove Corollary 1.3 as follows.

Proof of Corollary 1.3. Fix an open set   S with ()  (0, 1). It follows from [10,

Theorem 3.3] that

1/E 

=

inf
uN,1

E

(u,

u),

(3.6)

where N,1 := {u  F : u|c = 0 and (u) = 1}. Take

f

=

1 - () 1 - ()

.

It is easy to check that (f ) = 0 and f 2 = ()/(c). Notice that for any u  N,1, by simple calculation we have (uf ) = 1, thus u  Mf,1. So we see that N,1  Mf,1. Combining this fact with (1.5) and (3.6), we obtain that

2/2(X,

That is, E  2(X, f )/2. Moreover, from the reversibility and L2-exponential ergodicity we have





2(X, f )/2 = (Psf, f )ds 

Psf f ds  f 2/1.

Hence,
