Abstract
We review determinations of the electric proton charge radius from a diverse set of low-energy observables. We explore under which conditions it can be related to Wilson coefficients of appropriate effective field theories. This discussion is generalized to other low-energy constants. This provides us with a unified framework to deal with a set of low-energy constants of the proton associated with its electromagnetic interactions. Unambiguous definitions of these objects are given, as well as their relation with expectation values of QCD operators. We show that the proton radius obtained from spectroscopy and lepton-proton scattering (when both the lepton and proton move with nonrelativistic velocities) is related to the same object of the underlying field theory with O() precision. The model dependence of these analyses is discussed. The prospects of constructing effective field theories valid for the kinematic configuration of present, or near-future, lepton-proton scattering experiments are discussed.

1 Introduction
The determination of the electric proton charge radius from the measurement of the Lamb shift of muonic hydrogen by the CREMA collaboration [1, 2] with unprecedented accuracy, and its discrepancy with the, until then, accepted value of the proton radius, obtained as a weighted average of measurements from electron-proton scattering and the regular hydrogen Lamb shift [3],1 produced a shock in the scientific community, shacking the, then accepted, methods and, above all, error analyses of specialized determinations of the proton radius and related quantities.2 Different branches in high-energy, hadron, nuclear and atomic physics, associated with the physics of the different experiments used for these determinations, turned their attention to this problem producing a flurry of activity. Here we review some of this research. We do so within the context of effective field theories (EFTs). This allows us to describe the different experiments that yield determinations of the proton radius in an equal footing. In particular, we will make explicit the theoretical expressions that guarantee that the same definition of the proton radius is used for the different observables (with relative O() precision). This connection is achieved for the different spectroscopy and lepton-proton scattering experiments, but for the latter only in a very specific kinematic region. Nevertheless, we also discuss how to construct EFTs for leptonproton scattering experiments in an extended kinematics, which still guarantees that the very same proton radius is measured.
The use of EFTs also allows us to relate the determination of the proton radius with the determinations/definitions of other low-energy observables, providing a unified framework for dealing with low-energy constants that involve a single proton. These low-energy constants can also be related to form factors and structure functions (via expectation values of QCD operators). Expressions showing these relations are also displayed in this review. The fact that they can be understood as Wilson coefficients of an effective theory makes explicit that the form factors should be computed with an infrared cutoff. This infrared cutoff is the ultraviolet cutoff of the effective theory. In some cases, like for the anomalous magnetic moment, this cutoff can be sent smoothly to zero and the Wilson coefficient can be identified with a low-energy constant. In other cases, the cutoff produces logarithmic divergences. Therefore, only the combination of the Wilson coefficient with some Feynman diagrams of the effective theory yields a finite result. This is indeed the case of the proton radius. We will call such Wilson coefficients quasi-low-energy constants.
The experiments we mainly consider in this review are the elastic electron-proton scattering, the elastic muon-proton scattering, the Lamb shift of regular hydrogen, and the Lamb shift of muonic hydrogen. For these four experiments, we will consider that the transfer momentum between the lepton (either electron or muon) and the proton, Q2, is much smaller than the mass of the pion: Q2 m2. This will imply that all hadronic effects can be encoded in low-energy constants, which, in the language of EFTs, correspond to Wilson coefficients of the Lagrangian of the effective theory. In order to have a single EFT describing the nonrelativistic bound state and the lepton-proton scattering, we also need

the energy of the incoming lepton, E, to be nonrelativistic. In this situation, we can guarantee that we are using the same effective theory in all these experiments (or we can connect them by matching)
and, thus, the same Wilson coefficients, in particular the same proton radius. This situation is clearly fulfilled for the Lamb shift, as we have that Q  me and E - me  me2 for hydrogen, and Q  mµ and E - mµ  mµ2 for muonic hydrogen. For elastic electron-proton or muon-proton scattering, Q2 can be arbitrarily large3 or small. Therefore, we restrict to the study of these experiments for kinematic configurations such that Q2 m2. In order to have the complete connection with spectroscopy, we also require E - mli mli, where mli is the mass of the lepton (either muon or electron). In realistic kinematics for present lepton-proton scattering experiments, the lepton is relativistic and the effective
theory should be modified. We discuss this further in the main body of the review.
Another issue raised by the high precision measurement of the proton radius by the CREMA col-
laboration was the necessity to fix what had actually been measured in those different experiments.
In other words, what the definition of the proton radius was. Whereas at leading order in the electromagnetic coupling, , the definition of the proton radius was clear (the derivative of the electric Sachs form factor at zero momentum), this was not so at higher orders in . Actually, this issue had already been discussed in the context of the (muonic) hydrogen Lamb shift [6, 7] before the advent of
this measurement, but it was this very precise measurement that transformed this issue into an urgent
question to be elucidated, as the precision was high enough to discriminate among possible different
definitions. Indeed, one point that is often raised, and it is still open to some discussion, is whether
the proton radius measured in Lamb shift is the same as the proton radius measured in electron-proton scattering4. We clarify this issue in this review. Finally, we also remark that this is a general problem for several (quasi-)low-energy constants5 like the electric and magnetic polarizabilities. In any case, for
the other quasi-low-energy constants, the present precision is not high enough to require a quantitative
study of these effects.
At this stage, it is worth enumerating the different scales that are at hand (and the ratios of them that can be generated) for these observables. In the ep and µp systems, we are basically testing the proton with different point-like probes (e, µ, ) and several different scales are involved in their dynamics. For the ep system, they are (M is the proton mass): . . . , me2 , me, me, M = Mn - M , mµ,  = M - M , m, M , m, , . . . , which we group and name in the following way:

· me2: ultrasoft (US) scale.

· me: soft scale.

For the µp system, they are: . . . , mµ2 , mµ, mµ, M = Mn - M , me,  = M - M , m, M , m, , . . . , which we group and name in the following way:

· mµ2: US scale.

3Q2 is bounded from above since it is restricted to be in the interval 0  Q2  4M (E2 - m2)/(M + 2E). Nevertheless, it can be made arbitrarily large by changing E.
4Recently, this issue was settled in [8] at leading order without incorporation of electromagnetic corrections. It means
that such analysis does not solve the problems with the definition of the proton radius. Therefore, it does not address the issue that GE(0) is ill-defined once electromagnetic corrections are included, something that such work obviates.
5As stated before, we use the name of quasi-low-energy constants for Wilson coefficients that are logarithmically
infrared divergent.

Besides all these scales, we have the parameter Q, the transfer momentum between the lepton and

the proton. For the hydrogen and muonic hydrogen, Q  soft scale, whereas for the elastic scattering,

we will set Q to fulfill Q2 m2µ but will otherwise let it free. On top of that, for the case of the lepton-proton scattering, we have to consider the energy of

the incoming lepton, E, as another free variable. For spectroscopy, the bound-state dynamics fixes E - mli  mli2, which ensures that the lepton is nonrelativistic. Nevertheless, for lepton-proton scattering, E is not fixed a priori and could be very large. Actually, for nowadays experiments, it is

large.

By doing ratios of the different scales, several small expansion parameters can be built. Basically,

this will mean that the observables, can be written, up to large logarithms, as an expansion, in the

In some cases, it will also prove convenient to use the reduced mass

m(rµ/e),6 since it will allow to keep (some of) the exact mass dependence at each order in .

The main purpose of this review is the determination of the proton radius,7 which is a quasi-low-

energy constant. Therefore, ideally, we should take Q2  0, or approach this limit as much as possible.

According to the typical values of Q mentioned above, the determination of the proton radius from the

measurement of the Lamb shift of regular hydrogen would be ideal. On the other hand, the smaller the

value of Q, the most precise has to be the measurement, and the theoretical prediction, to determine

the slope of the Sachs form factor. At present, the experimental precision of Lamb shift of regular

hydrogen is not high enough and the muonic hydrogen represents, at present, the place on which the

precision of theory and experiment are optimal.

The electromagnetic proton radius, rp2, is a hadronic quantity. Chiral loops give contributions to rp2 that scale as  1/2, up to logarithmically enhanced contributions. Nevertheless, actual measurements
give that the size of the inverse proton radius is of the order of (or slightly smaller than) twice the pion

mass. The theoretical expressions that we will use in the determination of the electromagnetic proton

radius will have O() relative accuracy.8 Nevertheless, with this precision, other hadronic quantities

will appear. In principle, these have to be determined too. In practice, the only one that may cause

problems is what is called the two-photon exchange (TPE) correction. This correction is proportional to

the mass of the lepton. For the case of the electron-proton sector, this introduces an extra suppression

factor of order me/m that makes such contribution subleading. For the muon-proton sector, there is

no such suppression, since mµ/m  1, and such hadronic effect has to be carefully determined, at least

with

a

precision

of

order

rp2 2

In practice, the accuracy achieved for this quantity fixes the

accuracy one achieves in the determination of the proton radius from the muonic hydrogen Lamb shift.

We devote some time to study this quantity. We also do so for its spin-dependent counterpart, which

can be determined from measurements of the hyperfine splitting of hydrogen and muonic hydrogen.

The structure of the review will be as follows. We first discuss the EFTs that describe the observables

we use to determine the proton radius. We then discuss the relation of the Wilson coefficients of the

effective theory with the proton radius and other low-energy constants, as well as their relation with

form factors. We also give the expression for the TPE contribution in terms of structure functions, as

well as in terms of dispersion relations. We then write and discuss the theoretical expressions for the different observables. Afterwards, we review determinations of the proton radius, as well as of some other low-energy constants, including the TPE corrections. Finally, we conclude and summarize the situation of the proton radius puzzle. In the appendix, we give some details of the computation of the soft-photon emission in dimensional regularization.

2 Effective Field Theories
We display the EFTs suitable for the description of the Lamb shift in regular hydrogen and muonic hydrogen. We also show that these EFTs apply to the description of the muon-proton and electronproton elastic scattering in some specific kinematic region. For the muon-proton sector, the EFT is characterized by being in the kinematic regime with Q2 m2µ and E - mµ Q, where E is the energy of the incoming muon. For the electron-proton sector, the EFT is characterized by being in the kinematic regime with Q2 m2e and E - me Q, where E is the energy of the incoming electron. We then discuss the relation of the Wilson coefficients of the effective theory with the proton radius and other low-energy constants, as well as with the form factors. We also give the expression for the TPE contributions in terms of structure functions, as well as in terms of dispersion relations. Finally, we discuss how the EFTs should be changed to accommodate different kinematic regimes more relevant for, nowadays or near-to-come, lepton-proton elastic scattering experiments.

2.1 NRQED(µp)

In the muon-proton sector, by integrating out the scale m  mµ of HBET (see Sec. 2.3), an EFT for

non-relativistic muons and protons, relativistic electrons and photons appears. In principle, we should

also consider neutrons but they play no role at the precision we aim for. The effective theory is nothing

but NRQED [9] applied to this matter sector, as discussed in [10, 7, 11]. It has a hard cut-off  m

and therefore pion, Delta and higher resonances have been integrated out. The effective Lagrangian

reads

LNRQED(µ) = L + Le + L(µNR) + LN + LNe + L(NNµR) .

(2.1)

The pure photon sector is approximated by the following Lagrangian

L

d(2µ) + d2 + d(2) m2µ M 2 m2

Fµ D2F µ ,

(2.2)

d(2µ) and d(2) are generated by the vacuum polarization loops with only muons and taus respectively. At

O() they read

d(2 )

The hadronic effects of the vacuum polarization are encoded in d2 (where Z is the charge of the nucleus, with Z = 1 for the proton):

d2

=

M2 4 h(0)

=

Z2 60

+

dh2ad

+

O(2) .

(2.4)

h(0) is the derivative of the hadronic vacuum polarization (we have defined h(-k2) = -k2h(0) + . . .). The experimental figure for the total hadronic contribution reads h 9.3 × 10-3 GeV-2 [12]. Following standard practice, we have singled out the contribution due to the loops of protons (assuming them to be point-like) in the second equality of Eq. (2.4). Note though that dh2ad is still of order .

The electron sector reads (iDµ = iµ - eAµ) Le = ¯le(iD/ - me)le .

(2.5)

We do not include the term

-

egle mµ

since the coefficient gle is suppressed by powers of  and the mass of the lepton. Therefore, it would give contributions beyond the accuracy we aim for. In any case, any eventual contribution would be

absorbed in a low-energy constant.

with the following definitions: iDµ0 = i0 - eA0 and iDµ = i + eA. The Wilson coefficients c(Xµ) can be computed order by order in . They read (where we have used the fact that c(Sµ) = 2c(Fµ) - 1 [13])

Taking the values of the form factors for the muon-electron difference computed in [14] and those
for the electron computed in [15], we can deduce the following expression for the c(µ) () Wilson D,MS

(2.10)

For the determination of the Lamb shift with O(mµ6)× large logarithms accuracy (where the large logarithms are generated by the ratios of different scales), we only need c(Dµ) with O(2)× large logarithm accuracy. We also include the finite piece for completeness but neglect O(me/mµ) terms. Note that analogous O(2) terms (changing mµ by M and either keeping me or changing it by mµ) would exist for c(Dp) if computing the Wilson coefficient as if the proton were point-like at the scale M . Even if these effects are small, they should be taken into account for eventual comparisons with lattice simulations
where, typically, only the hadronic correction is computed.
9In NRQED(µp), the electron has not been integrated out. Therefore, Eq. (2.10) is not the cD(µ) Wilson coefficient of NRQED(µp). Eq. (2.10) will show up after lowering the muon energy cut-off below the electron mass in pNRQED (to be defined later, see Sec. 2.8). Still, we choose to present it here as, otherwise, we would be forced to do an extra intermediate matching computation that would unnecessarily complicate the derivation of the final result. Since we have integrated out the electron, note also that  = 1/137.14... in this equation, i.e., any running associated with the electron is written explicitly in Eq. (2.10).

where iDp0 = i0 + ZeA0, iDp = i - ZeA and for the proton Z = 1. The Wilson coefficients cF , cD, · · · are hadronic, non-perturbative quantities. In some cases, they can be directly related to low-energy constants, for instance with the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton, p = 1.792847356(23) [16], but not in other cases, like the proton radius. We ellaborate on this discussion in Sec. 2.7. Let us note that, with the conventions above, Np is the field of the proton (understood as a particle) with positive charge if li represents the leptons (understood as particles) with negative charge.
LNe refers to the four-fermion operator made of nucleons and (massless) electrons. It does not contribute to the muonic hydrogen spectrum at O(mr5), nor to the muon-proton scattering with the required accuracy. Still, we write it for completeness:

(2.13)

The discussion of c3 and c4 is postponed to Sec. 2.7.2.
This EFT (and consequently the very same Wilson coefficients) can also be applied to the elastic muon-proton scattering in the kinematic situation with (E - mµ)2 , Q2 m2µ.

2.2 NRQED(ep)

The effective Lagrangian relevant for the hydrogen Lamb shift reads

LNRQED(e) = L + L(eNR) + LN + L(NNeR) .

(2.14)

This effective theory is nothing but NRQED [9] applied to this matter sector, as discussed in [10, 7, 11]. It has a hard cut-off  me.
The different terms of the Lagrangian have the same form as in the previous section but changing
the Wilson coefficients. L is as in the previous section (Eq. (2.2)) but adding the electron vacuum polarization correction. L(eNR) is as L(µNR) in the previous section (Eq. (2.7)) changing the muon by the electron. For the hydrogen Lamb shift, we need more precision than for the muonic hydrogen Lamb shift. This means that more terms in the 1/me expansion of the Lagrangian density than in the analogous µp case need to be considered. Nowadays, the NRQED Lagrangian for the electron-proton sector is known to O(1/m4): [9, 13, 17]. We refer to the last reference for the explicit expressions. Also

10The coefficients c3 and c4 should actually read cp3lµ and cp4lµ , as they actually depend on the nucleon and lepton the four-fermion operator is made of. Nevertheless, to ease the notation we eliminate those indices when it can be deduced
from the context.

The important point for us is that the Wilson coefficients of LN do not change with respect to the muon-proton case, which is where we have the proton radius. L(NNeR) has the same form as L(NNµR) (see Eq. (2.13)) in the previous section (replacing the muon by the electron) but the Wilson coefficients are

different. The leading contribution to c3 is proportional to the mass of the lepton (see the discussion in

[7]

This EFT can also be used for the description of the elastic scattering of the electron and proton
in the kinematic condition (E - me)2 , Q2 m2e, and, therefore, the very same Wilson coefficients (in particular the proton radius and the TPE Wilson coefficient, c3) appear.

2.3 Relativistic muon with Q2  m2µ  m2
The kinematic constraints of Sec. 2.1 can be relaxed to ease the connection with the kinematics of forthcoming experiments. Therefore, we consider the situation Q2  m2µ and E2  m2µ, where E is the energy of the incoming electron. In this situation, we have Q2  m2, and it is natural to consider HBET [21] as the effective theory to describe this kinematic regime. Indeed, this is a situation that could be realized in the MUSE experiment. It corresponds to a hard cut-off  << M , , and much larger than any other scale in the problem.
The HBET Lagrangian applied to this specific matter sector has been considered in Ref. [10]. The starting point is the SU(2) version of HBET coupled to leptons, where the Delta is also kept as an explicit degree of freedom (based on large Nc arguments). The degrees of freedom of this theory are the proton, neutron and Delta, for which the non-relativistic approximation can be taken, pions and leptons (muons and electrons), which will be taken relativistic, and photons.

9

The Lagrangian can be structured as follows

LHBET = L + Ll + L + Ll + LN + L(N,) + L(N,)l + L(N,) + L(N,)l,

(2.18)

representing the different sectors of the theory. In particular, the  stands for the spin-3/2 baryon multiplet (we also use  = M - M , the specific meaning in each case should be clear from the context).
The Lagrangian can be written as an expansion in e and 1/M (M is of the order of the scales that have been integrated out). Let us consider the different pieces of the Lagrangian more in detail.
L has the same form as Eq. (2.2) but without including the vacuum polarization of the particles that are still relativistic in the theory. Similarly, the leptonic sector reads (iDµ = iµ - eAµ)

Ll = ¯li(iD/ - mli)li ,
i

(2.19)

where now i = e, µ. We do not include the term

-

egli M

¯liµ liF µ

,

(2.20)

since the coefficient gli is suppressed by powers of  and the mass of the lepton. In any case, any eventual contribution would be absorbed in a low-energy constant.
The pionic Lagrangian L is usually organized in the chiral counting. For the chiral computations that appear in this review, the free pion propagator provides with the necessary precision. Therefore, we only need the free-particle pionic Lagrangian:

(2.21)

The one-baryon Lagrangian L(N,) is needed at O(1/M 2). Nevertheless, a closer inspection simplifies the problem. A chiral loop produces a factor 1/(4F0)2  1/M 2. Therefore, the pion-baryon interactions are only needed at O(m), the leading order, which is known [21, 22, 23]:11

L(N,) = N¯ (i0 + gAu · S) N + gN T¯aµwµaN + h.c. ,

11Actually, terms that go into the physical mass of the proton and into the physical value of the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton p = c(Fp) - Z should also be included (at least in the pure QED computations) and that will be assumed in what follows. For the computations reviewed in this paper, these effects would be formally subleading. In
any case, their role is just to bring the bare values of M0 and µ0 to their physical values. Therefore, once the values of M and p are measured by different experiments, they can be distinguished from the effects explicitly considered in this
review.

10

Therefore, we only need the one-baryon Lagrangian LN at O(1/M 2) coupled to electromagnetism. This would be a NRQED-like Lagrangian for the proton, neutron (of spin 1/2) and the Delta (of spin
3/2). The neutron is actually not needed at this stage and LN has the same form as Eq. (2.11). It is very important to emphasize that the hadronic Wilson coefficients of LN do not yet incorporate effects associated with the pion and/or Delta particle.
As for the Delta (of spin 3/2), it mixes with the nucleons at O(1/M ) (O(1/M 2) are not needed in our case). The only relevant interaction in our case is the p-+- term, which is encoded in

L(N,)

T ((31//22)) · B  3(1(/3/22) )N + h.c.

(2.27)

where T stands for the delta 3/2 isospin multiplet and N for the nucleon 1/2 isospin multiplet.

The baryon-lepton Lagrangian provides new terms that are not usually considered in HBET. The

relevant term in our case is the interaction between the leptons and the nucleons (actually only the

proton):

i

i

(2.28)

The above matching coefficients fulfill cp3,lRi = cp3,R and cp4,lRi = cp4,R up to terms suppressed by mli/M . Note that these Wilson coefficients are different from those that appear in Eq. (2.13), since dynamical effects associated with the pion and Delta particle are not incorporated in c3,R and c4,R. We do not consider possible extra dimension six four-fermion operators because they are suppressed by an extra factor of mli/ due to chiral symmetry.
Finally, the remaining terms in the HBET Lagrangian in Eq. (2.18) can be neglected for the purposes

of this review.

2.4 Relativistic muon with Q2 m2µ
An intermediate situation between the one discussed in the previous section and the one discussed in Sec. 2.1 is to set Q2 m2µ, E2  m2µ and (E - mµ)2  m2µ. This is a situation that could be realized for a certain range of parameters in the MUSE experiment [24]. Obviously, this situation could still be
described using HBET. Nevertheless, such effective theory does not profit from the kinematic constraint that Q2 m2, since, in this situation, the pion and Delta could be integrated out, as they do not appear as asymptotic states. Nevertheless, the fact that E and E - mµ are of the same order as the pion mass complicates the construction of an efficient EFT. E cannot be approximated by mµ because E - mµ is of the order of the muon mass. A natural way to deal with this situation with EFTs is to consider E as a fixed scale, in the spirit of LEET [25] (or of its more modern SCET versions), and treat it at the same level as the muon mass or other scales that have been integrated out and are not dynamical anymore. Actually, one could also consider the situation when E2 m2µ (such kinematics cannot be described with the HBET described in the previous section), which would also naturally be described
by a LEET-like effective theory. This kinematics will be realized in COMPASS [26]. This would be
a very interesting line of research to be pursued (indeed the elastic electron-proton scattering in the situation Q2 m2e has been studied using SCET in [27] and used to incorporate the resummation of large logarithms).
We emphasize that trying to describe this kinematic regime with an EFT Lagrangian like

LQED(µ) = L + Le + Lµ + LN + LNµ + LNe ,

(2.29)

would require the four-fermion vertex to be a complicated function. The complication appears in the four-fermion sector due to the dependence on E, the lepton energy. Still, it is very important to emphasize that LN and the hadronic Wilson coefficients of LN remain equal, since the pion and Delta

11

can be integrated out, and, in the proton bilinear sector, the relevant scale for matching is Q2 rather than E, the former being invariant under changes of reference frame.

2.5 Boosted NRQED(µp)
A possible way out to the problem posed in the previous section is to boost the proton to the reference frame where the incoming muon is at rest, i.e., such that E = mµ. This would guarantee that the outcoming muon is still nonrelativistic (E - mµ mµ), since we restrict to the kinematic situation where Q2 m2µ. Then, matching computations, and computations of observables, would be like for standard NRQED(µp) but with a boosted proton: P µ = M vµ + kµ, where v2 = 1 and kµ is small. Note that with this EFT we can study, on an equal footing, the situation (in the reference frame where the incoming proton is at rest) when E  mµ or when E mµ, as far as Q2 m2µ. This was the situation studied in the previous section. Note that, in the EFT that we have in this section, the difference between having E  mµ or E mµ, discussed in the previous section, would just reflect in a different value of v, wherever it appears.
By working with this EFT, we can then do matching computations and integrate out pions and
Deltas without problems. For the bilinear proton part of the Lagrangian, the Wilson coefficients do not change, since the internal scale in the matching computations is Q2, which does not change after boosts. The difference appears in the four-fermion sector. The computation would be similar to the one made in [28, 29] but with a boosted proton. A new vector v appears. In a way, compared with the previous section, we trade E by v. The advantage is that it is easier to construct the effective theory, it is just NRQED(µp) but with a boosted proton. The Lagrangian would read as follows

LQED(µ) = L + Le + Lµ + LNv + LNvµ + LNve ,

(2.30)

where we use Nv to emphasize that the proton is boosted. The different terms that appear in this Lagrangian are equal to those that also appear in Eq. (2.18), except for the pieces of the Lagrangian with Nv field content. These now read12

(2.33)

To write these terms as general as possible, we have introduced a v for the muon, even if we set v = (1, 0) for the reference frame of the muon at rest. The vectors eiµ and eµi are space-like vectors

12For completeness, we also include the four-fermion operators made of proton and lepton, even though they are negligible for the experiments at hand.

12

such that v · ei = 0 and ei · ej = -ij, and v · e i = 0 and e i · e j = -ij. Note that the set {v, ei} (and also {v , e i}) form a basis of the space-time manifold.
The four-fermion operators with muon-proton content now have potentially four Wilson coefficients that should be determined. It would be very interesting to do the matching computation and try to determine them. After the computation is done, transforming to the frame where the experiment was actually made would be a trivial thing.
As we have already mentioned, the Wilson coefficients of the bilinear term do not change with respect to those one has in the rest frame, as they only depend on Q2, which is Lorentz invariant. Note also that with this trick, we could study in a controlled way the experiments in MUSE and COMPASS, as far as Q2 m2. Going from one experimental setup to the other could be done by a change of v.
This EFT could also be useful for a possible experiment of the scattering of a proton on the muonic hydrogen at rest. This is a kind of gedanken experiment for muons but has been considered in the case of the scattering of protons on hydrogen [30].

2.6 Relativistic electron with Q2 m2 , m2µ

If Q2 m2µ and E - me me, we are in the kinematic configuration where we can apply the NRQED(ep) Lagrangian described in Sec. 2.2. This guarantees that the very same Wilson coefficients

as in hydrogen are used. It also guarantees that the same proton radius is measured as in hydrogen and

muonic hydrogen (at least with relative O() precision). On the other hand, such kinematic constraints

are very restrictive and are not satisfied by the experimental setup of present, and near-future, electron-

proton scattering experiments. We can relax the previous conditions to Q2 m2µ and E2 m2µ. Nevertheless, here we cannot play the same trick as before. Even if we put the initial electron at

rest, after the collision the electron is scattered ultrarelativistically. The following Lagrangian could be

considered if E2 m2, m2µ

L = L + Le + LN + LNe .

(2.34)

In other words, it is the same Lagrangian of HBET (see Eq. (2.18)) but without pions, muons, and Deltas. If we are in the situation where the incoming electron is more energetic, with E  mµ, we can use the HBET Lagrangian of Eq. (2.18) but without muons. If we want to profit from the kinematic constraint Q2 m2 we have the same problems as in Sec. 2.4, and the same discussion applies. Also, if we consider the situation mµ < E for electron-proton scattering (which is realistic), we should treat the electron as an ultra-relativistic particle, even if we restrict to Q2 m2µ, and the same discussion as in Sec. 2.4 applies.
In any case, irrespective of this discussion, it is very important to emphasize that the hadronic
Wilson coefficients of LN remain equal, as far as the energy and three-momentum of the photon is much smaller than the mass of the pion.

2.7 Low-energy constants, Wilson coefficients and form factors
In this section, we show the relation between the Wilson coefficients of the effective theory, the form factors, and the low-energy constants.

2.7.1 Form factors We define the form factors as (Jµ = N¯pµNp)

p , s|Jµ|p, s

= u¯(p )

F1(-q2)µ

+

iF2(-q2)

and Taylor expand Fi in powers of Q2  -q2:

Fi(Q2)

(2.36)

and we define

F~i  Fi(0),

F~i(n)



dnFi (d(Q2/M 2))n

.
Q2=0

(2.37)

Assuming the analyticity of form factors in the complex q2 plane and the appropriate high-energy behavior, i.e., |F1(Q2)/Q2|, |F2(Q2)| < |const|, we write down the subtracted and unsubtracted
Q2
dispersion relations for the proton form factors F1 and F2 respectively:

dt

4m2



F2

Q2

1 =

ImF2

(-t - t + Q2

i)

dt

.

4m2

(2.38)

Dispersive integrals start from the 2-pion production threshold in the time-like region (Q2 < 0) corresponding to pp¯ production or annihilation. Lepton-proton scattering kinematics is given by spacelike momentum transfer Q2 > 0.
One important issue that is often raised is whether electromagnetic corrections are included in the matrix element of Eq. (2.35). We choose them to be included, otherwise one should include more correlators of O(), besides the TPE correction, in the observables we consider.
The Sachs form factors disentangle the interaction of the proton with the electric and magnetic field in the nonrelativistic limit. Therefore, it is natural to use them for the interaction of photons with protons at low energies. The relation between Pauli and Sachs form factors (for the proton) reads

GE(Q2) = F1(Q2) -  F2(Q2), GM (Q2) = F1(Q2) + F2(Q2),

(2.39)

with



=

Q2 4M 2

,

and the values at zero-momentum transfer are

(2.40)

F1(0) = Z, F2(0) = p.

(2.41)

The low momentum transfer expansion of the Sachs form factors relates to the different radii as

GE(Q2)

=

Z

-

rp2 3!

Q2

+

r4 E Q4 - 5!

r6 E Q6 + ... , 7!

(2.42)

and

GM(Q2) = 1 - Z + p

r2 M Q2 + 3!

r4 M Q4 - 5!

r6 M Q6 + ... . 7!

(2.43)

The form factors are the scalar components of the matrix element of the electromagnetic current

sandwiched between proton states. These matrix elements include loop corrections (both hadronic and

electromagnetic). When relating these matrix elements with the Wilson coefficients of the EFT, it

should be understood that these loops have an infrared cutoff and that this infrared cutoff corresponds

to the ultraviolet cutoff of the effective theory. As the effective theories we consider have an ultraviolet

cutoff much smaller than the hadronic scale, all hadronic effects are encoded in the Wilson coefficients.

14

The only loops for which a cutoff has to be introduced are of electromagnetic origin and produce that some rn are  dependent, where  is the cutoff of the effective theory. This dependence is logarithmic if working with dimensional regularization. If there is no logarithmic dependence on the factorization scale, like for p and others, they can be associated with low-energy constants. Rewriting them in terms of low-energy constants one has

(2.44) (2.45)

Note that p includes O() effects. In principle, this is also so for hpad, to which we have subtracted the proton-associated point-like contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment (note that the point-like result is a bad approximation for c(Fp), even though it gives the right order of magnitude).
When the radii are factorization scale dependent, one cannot assign low-energy constants to the Wilson coefficients (or the radii).13 Instead, as we have already mentioned, we name them quasi-low-
energy constants (as they have to be combined with a loop computation in the effective theory to yield
the theory prediction for the observable). The most paradigmatic example is the proton radius (see
also the discussion in Ref. [7]). It can be written in the following way in terms of the electromagnetic
current form factors at zero momentum:

(2.46)

This object is infrared divergent, which makes it scale and scheme dependent. This is not a problem from the EFT point of view but makes the definition of the proton radius ambiguous. The standard practice is to make explicit the proton-associated point-like contributions in the computation. This means using the following definition for the proton radius

c(p) () D,MS



Z

4 3

rp2

(2.47)

In other words, the standard definition (which corresponds to the experimental number) of the proton radius reads (up to O(2) corrections):

rp2

=

3 4

1 M2

c(p) (M ) - Z D,MS

.

(2.48)

Note that rp includes O() terms in its definition. This should be kept in mind when comparing with lattice determinations. Note, also, that this definition sets  = M . This is not natural, since this

assumes that the proton is point-like up to (and beyond) the scales of the proton mass. This is a bad

approximation, as we can see comparing the piece of c(p) associated to the structure of the proton: D,MS

4 3

rp2

M

2

21.3, with "Z=1" for a point-like particle. This illustrates that the point-like result does not

even give the right order of magnitude of cD.14

After the discussion of those particular examples, we now discuss the other Wilson coefficients that

appear at low orders in the 1/M expansion. From [13, 17], we can relate the NRQED Wilson coefficients

13Actually, for a unique relation between low-energy constants and Wilson coefficients, the Lagrangian density has to
be expanded in a minimal basis of operators. This is true irrespectively of working with low-energy or quasi-low-energy
constants. 14Note that this also happens for the Wilson coefficients cA1 and cA2 (for their definition, see Ref. [7]), for which their
physical values are far from zero: cA1 12 and cA2 -72, even though for a point-like particle their values would be "1" and "0" respectively (up to O() corrections).

It is quite remarkable that they are scale dependent, as these radii are of fundamental importance in
determinations of the proton radius from lepton-proton scattering [31]. Nevertheless, with the present
level of precision, such ambiguity should not affect present determinations of the proton radius. In
the future, as the precision increases, this discussion will be relevant if we aim to give unambiguous determinations of these quantities with O() precision (as we do already for rp2). Therefore, let us discuss what is known at present for the O() running of these Wilson coefficients. One can read the point-like contribution at one loop in the MS from [13] (see also [32])

(2.54) (2.55)

Note that, unlike what happens for the proton radius, what we call the pure hadronic quantity may still have  scale dependence. This happens when the Wilson coefficients that contribute to the renormalization group equation of a given Wilson coefficient are different from the point-like expressions. This

16

is indeed the case for cW1. Its running was computed in [33] (for the running including light fermions, see Eq. (45) of [34], which produces logarithmically enhanced corrections at higher powers in ):

c(Xp3) is not known. Therefore, the running of

r4

It would also be interesting to study the general (to-all-orders in ) renormalization properties of the

Wilson coefficients and the associated radii. For point-like computations, c(Fp) is renormalization group

independent, as it is expected for a low-energy constant. The same should happen after the inclusion

of hadronic corrections. For c(Dp), it seems that there is no renormalization after one loop. It would be

interesting to see if this could be proven to all orders.

2.7.2 Structure functions

We also consider matrix elements of the time-ordered product of two electromagnetic currents. For on-
shell photons, they are of relevance for the determination of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the proton, related to the Wilson coefficients c(Ap1) and c(Ap2) of the EFT. They can be determined from accurate measurements of the Compton scattering. Nevertheless, this is beyond the purpose of this
review. Here we only mention that their definition may suffer from some ambiguities, and that they are infrared divergent at O() (see, for instance, [17, 35]).
For the case of off-shell photons, the forward doubly virtual Compton tensor is of particular interest
to this review,

It depends on four scalar functions, which we call structure functions. We split the tensor into the symmetric (spin-independent), TSµ = TSµ (the first two terms of Eq. (2.58)), and antisymmetric (spindependent) pieces, TAµ = -TAµ (the last two terms of Eq. (2.58)).

consistent with the expression obtained long ago in Ref. [42]. These expressions keep the complete dependence on mli and are valid both for NRQED(µp) and
NRQED(ep). Again, it is common practice to single-out the proton-associated point-like contribution.
Note that this assumes that one can treat the proton as point-like at energies of the order of the proton mass. We have already seen that this is a bad approximation for cD and other Wilson coefficients. Nevertheless, we keep this procedure for the sake of comparison.16 Therefore (we write the expression for a generic lepton li),

The expression of ds should be understood in the MS scheme, dv on the other hand is finite. ds was computed in Ref. [43] and dv in Ref. [9].

2.8 potential NRQED

To deal with the case when both the proton and the lepton are nonrelativistic, it is convenient to use the EFT named potential NRQED (pNRQED) [44]. It combines quantum mechanics perturbation theory for the nonrelativistic bound state (or for the fermion-antifermion pair above threshold) and quantum field theory for the relativistic massless modes: photons (and light fermions, if they exist in the effective theory). This EFT is optimal if compared with NRQED because it makes explicit that for nonrelativistic modes (leptons) there are no physical degrees of freedom (as asymptotic states) with energy of order mliv, where v is the velocity of the lepton. This is achieved by integrating out scales of O(mliv). We next discuss the main features of this theory when applied to the muon-proton sector and when applied to the electron-proton sector. A more detailed exposition of the former can be found in [10, 7, 11] and of the latter in [45, 46].

16In this expression, we have computed the loop with the proton being relativistic to follow common practice. Nevertheless, this assumes that one can consider the proton to be point-like at the scales of the proton mass. To stick to a standard EFT approach one should consider the proton to be nonrelativistic. Then one would obtain

could be some difference due to truncation, but always of the order of the error of the computation.

19

2.8.1 pNRQED(µp)
After integrating out scales of O(mµ  me) in NRQED(µp), the resulting effective theory is pNRQED(µp). This EFT naturally gives a Schro¨dinger-like formulation of the bound-state problem but still keeping the quantum field theory nature of the interaction with ultrasoft photons, as well as keeping the information due to high-energy modes (of a quantum field theory nature) in the Wilson coefficients of the theory. Up to O(mr5), the effective Lagrangian reads

respectively.

The potential V can be written as an expansion in 1/mµ, 1/M , , ... We will assume 1/r  me (which is realistic for the case at hand) and that mµ M . We then organize the potential as an

expansion in 1/mµ:

V (x, p, 1, 2) = V (0)(r) + V (1)(r) + V (2)(r) + · · · ,

(2.79)

where

V

(n)

We will also make the expansion in powers of  explicit. This means that

the

solution to the bound or near-threshold state problem:

h

=

p2 2mr

-

Z r

.

(2.82)

Thus, the contribution to the energy of a given potential is (for near-threshold states we take v  ,

though this could be relaxed)

V (n,r)  mµ1+n+r ,

(2.83)

up to large logarithms or potential suppression factors due to powers of 1/M . Iterations of the potential are dealt with using standard quantum mechanics perturbation theory producing corrections such as:

V (n,r) · · · V (m,s)  mµ1+n+r+(1+m+s-2) ,

(2.84)

and alike. Therefore, in order to reach the desired O(m5) accuracy, V (0) has to be computed up to

O(4), V (1) up to O(3), V (2) up to O(2) and V (3) up to O().

The different potentials are obtained by matching the NRQED(µp) diagrams (using static propa-

gators for the proton and/or muon) to the diagrams in pNRQED(µp) in terms of potentials (see Ref.

[11] for details). In this way, the Coulomb potential and its corrections are generated. In particular,

the leading correction to the Coulomb potential is generated by the vacuum polarization of the photon

(see Fig. 1):

This term indeed produces the bulk of the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen. The next-to-next-to-leading

order term of the static potential can be understood as a correction to the vacuum polarization. It

was computed by K¨allen and Sabry [47]. The next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order term of the static

potential coming from the vacuum polarization has been computed in Ref. [48], see also [49] where the

complete set of diagrams can be found. The remaining next-to-next-to-leading order contribution to

the static potential is generated by diagrams that cannot be completely associated with the vacuum

polarization. This object could be deduced from the computation in Ref. [50]. For the other corrections

to the Coulomb potential, see [7, 11]. The matching at tree level is shown in Fig. 2. For us, the

main concern are the hadronic corrections. The leading hadronic corrections always appear in the same

combination

(2.89)

This contribution is generated by matching the first, third and last diagram of Fig. 2 to a Dirac-delta

potential. Therefore, low-energy experiments cannot disentangle the three different Wilson coefficients,

but only measure the specific combination in Eq. (2.89). If one wants to determine the proton radius,

one needs to determine the other Wilson coefficients from different sources with enough precision. For

illustration, if one aims to determine the proton radius with 1 per mille precision, one would need to

know the TPE contribution with 10% accuracy, since the size of the TPE contribution is around 1% the

size of the proton radius contribution, and the hadronic vacuum polarization with 30% accuracy, since

the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution is around 0.3% the size of the proton radius contribution.

2.8.2 pNRQED(ep)
One can obtain the pNRQED(ep) effective Lagrangian from the one of the previous section by switching off the electron contribution, changing the muon by the electron, and then adding the muon vacuum polarization correction to d2. To O(me5), such Lagrangian can be found in the appendix of [46]. Nevertheless, for nowadays precision of regular hydrogen Lamb shift, one should write the Lagrangian to higher order in both the 1/me and the  expansion. The explicit expression of such Lagrangian

EFT computation in Sec. 3.2. In any case, note that this effective theory is not suitable for the elastic electron-proton scattering case at Q2 m2e but requires Q2 m2e.

3 Observables. Spectroscopy
3.1 Muonic hydrogen Lamb shift: E(2P1/2) - E(2S1/2)
The only experimental measurements of the muonic hydrogen Lamb shift [1, 2] correspond to the energy difference E(2P3/2) - E(2S1/2) and E(2P1/2) - E(2S1/2). For theoretical discussion, we focus on the latter. Its determination with EFTs was worked out in [51, 11]. It uses pNRQED applied to the muonproton sector. It has embedded the Wilson coefficients of the NRQED Lagrangian in the potentials. The determination of the spectrum is achieved by a combination of quantum mechanic perturbation theory and the interaction of the bound state with ultrasoft photons, which is computed using quantum field theory techniques. All these computations are made using dimensional regularization.

ln R(n, l) are the Bethe logarithms and are implicitly defined by the

Most of the contributions to the Lamb shift generated from nonrelativistic quantum mechanics per-

turbation theory were known prior to the EFT computation, see [53, 54, 49, 55, 50]. These contributions

can be easily incorporated into the EFT framework. Some of them were checked in [11], where one

can find the complete set of contributions to this order. Note that, even though most of the contri-

butions can be associated with a pure QED calculation, the hadronic effects are also included in this

23

computation. Their effects are included in the NRQED Wilson coefficients, and are encoded in the delta potential in the Lagrangian of pNRQED (see Eq. (2.89). Finally, the theoretical expression for the proton radius reads [11]

(3.5)

Note that since ch3ad  2 and dh2ad  2, the third line of the previous equation encodes all the hadronic effects of order 5 that are not related to the proton radius. This presentation of the result
where rp and ch3ad are kept explicit could be important for the future. In the long term (once the origin
of the proton radius puzzle is clarified) the natural place from where to obtain the proton radius is the
hydrogen Lamb shift and ch3ad (once the radius has been obtained) from the muonic hydrogen, since ch3ad is suppressed by an extra factor of the lepton mass. In this scenario, a complete evaluation of the O(mr6) term may improve the precision of an eventual experimental determination of ch3ad. Note that, in this discussion, we assume that we can determine dh2ad from alternative methods, like dispersion
relations.

3.2 Regular hydrogen Lamb shift

We now discuss the theoretical determination of the Lamb shift for regular hydrogen. Reviews of theoretical expressions for different energy splittings can be found in [56, 57] and [58, 59]. The first two give a detailed account of the different contributions to the Lamb shift. The last two references give more updated reviews including the most up-to-date computations. We will use them for the discussion in this section.
The mass of a (n )fj state of hydrogen17 can be written as18

En jf = me + M + En(g) + En(fsj) + En(hjfsf),

(3.6)

where

En(g)

=

(3.7)

is the gross structure, En(fsj) is named the fine structure contribution, and En(hjfsf) the hyperfine structure contribution.19 Here, mr=meM/(me + M ) is the reduced mass.
We focus here on the evaluation of En(fsj). Its contributions can be organized in the following way:

En(fsj)

-

m2r 2(me +

,

(3.8)

17We use here the most common notation in atomic physics, where F = L + S, J = L + Se, and the lower case parameters are their corresponding quantum numbers, where L is the angular momentum, Se is the spin of the electron and S = Se + Sp is the total spin. A different basis is used in other references, as, e.g., in [11], where the notation would change j  je (actually jµ because in that case the muonic hydrogen case was under study), f  j and a redundant basis with s as a quantum number is kept.
18We borrow the notation from [58]. 19The hyperfine splitting for the ground state of hydrogen is studied in the following section and for the muonic hydrogen
in the next-to-following section.

As it is customary, we include the exact solution of the Dirac equation with the Coulomb potential

in the first term in (3.8) (after subtracting the leading term). This solution includes an infinite set of

relativistic corrections in the infinite proton mass limit. They are organized in even powers of Z. This

result should be possible to obtain from an EFT computation. One should use the NRQED Lagrangian

to all orders in the 1/me expansion but setting the transverse photon components to zero and only including the covariant time derivative (i.e., the longitudinal photon in the Coulomb gauge), setting the

mass of the proton to infinity, and all the radiative corrections to the Wilson coefficients to zero. At low

orders, one has the Balmer formula (which we explicitly subtract) and the first relativistic corrections

are traditionally associated with the Breit-Fermi potential (but setting the proton mass to infinity).

Some recoil corrections associated with the finite mass nature of the proton are included in the

second term of (3.8). This term is generated by considering some relativistic corrections in 1/M but

computing the matrix elements using the solution of the Dirac equation with a Coulomb potential.

The term EEFT incorporates all the contributions that have been computed using pNRQED(ep) up to O(mr5) plus higher-order contributions from the Wilson coefficients in Eqs. (2.15-2.17). The total contribution reads20

Note that there are no me(Z)5 effects in the infinite proton mass limit (they only appear after

including 1/M corrections) in Eq. (3.11). Note also that the first two terms in (3.11) are introduced to

compensate for double counting with the first two terms in Eq. (3.8). Finally, it can be seen that the
contributions of O(mr6) and O(mr7) in (3.11), which are associated with the hard scale, correspond to the contributions from the functions B40 and C40 in [59], respectively.
The terms En(nj) in (3.8) contain the remaining known terms of O(mrn). En(6)j is fully known in the static limit and at leading recoil order. It reads

(3.15)

The first term of Eq. (3.14) was computed in e.g. [65] (it corresponds to Eq. (4.23) in [57]). It could
be obtained from the determination of O(1/M ) tree-level diagrams in NRQED and correspondingly
matching them to potentials in pNRQED (see for instance [66]). The logarithmic dependent term in (3.14), proportional to rp2, comes from second order perturbation theory of the delta-potential and was originally computed in [67] (see [68] for the computation in the setup of the pNRQED). Note that we
only keep the logarithmic term with this precision, as finite corrections will be of the same order as contributions in the Wilson coefficient c(31),had, which are model dependent. O(3) corrections to c3 are encoded in c(31) and c(31),had. The first term encodes the contributions that are independent of the structure of the proton. They scale like 1/m2e and 1/me. They would be generated by a matching computation after integrating out the hard scale  me (see, for instance, Figs. 3.9 and 3.10 in [57], which would produce contributions that would be encoded in the coefficients A50 and V50 in the notation of
[59]). The second term encodes the corrections that are sensitive to the structure of the proton, of
these we only keep the leading logarithmic-dependent terms, as it is the only piece that is model independent.21 Their role is to cancel the scale dependence of the second order perturbation theory

21Contrary to [57, 59], we do not include the non-logarithmic rp-dependent contribution of order (Z)6 as its computation contains certain model dependence.

computation in the EFT. One thing that has to be determined is the scale at which the divergence gets regulated. Typically, it is assumed that it is regulated at some hadronic scale, i.e.,   m or higher. For instance, in [58], the inverse of the proton radius was taken. This is something that should be more deeply investigated. In this respect, note that there are no me6 ln(1/) corrections to the Lamb shift if one considers the proton to be point-like. The effect in the energy shift is however small.
We now summarize the remaining O(me7) and O(me8) corrections:

(3.17)

Note that in (3.16) there are no corrections of O(me(Z)43), as they are all encoded in the Wilson coefficients in (3.11). Actually, it is a general pattern that the corrections of order mr(Z)4n can be encoded in EnEFjT, either from the ultrasoft O(5) correction or from radiative corrections associated with the hard scale (the mass of the electron) encoded in the Wilson coefficients. This discussion also
makes evident that, at present, there are uncomputed O(mr(Z)44) contributions to the Lamb shift. To obtain those, one would need to compute c(De) and c(Fe) to O(4). In Ref. [59], the estimated error associated with these contributions was assumed to be

(Z )4 n3

10 Hz n3

.

(3.18)

This estimate assumes that the coefficient multiplying this correction is of O(1).
In Eqs. (3.16) and (3.17), we follow the standard notation used in [59] (but also compare with [57]). In the notation of these papers, D functions come from relativistic recoil corrections, A's from self energy, V 's from vacuum polarization, B's from two-photon corrections and C's from 3-photon corrections.22 The different terms of these corrections read, =ln(me/(mr(Z)2)),

(3.26)

As we said, we follow the notation of [59], but these contributions can also be found in [57]. We give
here the relation of our equations to those of this last reference for ease of reference: (3.26) corresponds
to Eq. (3.66). (3.19) to the double log in Eq. (3.53). (3.20) to the sum of the single log in Eq. (3.53) and (3.55). (3.25) is the recoil correction in Eq. (4.24). B5(n0 ) has been computed numerically in [70]. The estimate for partial results for B6(n0 ) are discussed in [59]. The function C5(n0 ) in (3.17) is yet unknown, even though partial results can be found in [71] (Eqs. (3.51)-(3.53) in [57]). Again, comparing
to the results in [57], we find that (3.21) is the sum of Eqs. (3.41)-(3.43) and (3.46)-(3.48), (3.22) is
Eq. (3.75), (3.23) corresponds to Eqs. (3.77), (3.78), (3.86) and (3.92), while (3.24) can be obtained
from Eqs. (3.79), (3.80), (3.83), (3.87), (3.88) and (3.93)-(3.94). The coefficients A61 and A60 (G(SnE j)(0)), B62, B61 and B60 have been computed in [72] in the context
of NRQED. B60 is computed numerically, and the error quoted in [59] is of the order of 30%. The values of GS(nE j)(Z) and G(V1P)(n j)(Z) of Eq. (3.16), are discussed in Ref. [59], where one can find tabulated values (see also Refs. [73, 74, 72]). Note that their determinations formally obtain higher orders in , including some logarithms of O(mr8). Expanding in Z,

G(SnE j)(Z) = A(6n0 j) + A(7n1 j)(Z) + · · · , G(VnPj)(Z) = V6(0n j) + V7(1n j)(Z) + · · · ,

(3.27) (3.28)

and, from Eqs. (3.97) and (3.100) in [57], one obtains

A(7n1 j) = 

139

- ln 2 64

 0,

V7(1n

j)

=

5  96

0.

(3.29)

Values for A6(n0 j) can also be found in Table 3.4 of [57] and V60 is obtained from Eqs. (3.64), (3.68) and (3.70) of this reference. It is worth noting that the difference between the all-order computation of G(SnE j)(Z) and the expansion in (3.27) is  13 kHz for 1S hydrogen. The attitude towards this problem is to take the numerical determination as the correct one (assuming that the uncomputed terms would

28

make up for the difference). The claimed error of the numerical evaluation of G(SnE j)(Z) is enough for nowadays required precision.
The values of D7(n1 j) have been recently calculated numerically in [75], where they also give an estimate for D7(n0 j). Other functions can be found in CODATA [59] and agree with [57].
The identification of Eqs. (3.16) and (3.17) with a computation in the effective theory is more complicated, except for the analysis performed in [72]. One can also see that the coefficient B50 could be associated with a hard contribution, and similarly for C50, though this coefficient is not known completely. Other contributions can be thought of as combinations of perturbation theory of potentials and ultrasoft loops. This is particularly so for those that have a nontrivial (different from l0/n3) dependence on the quantum numbers of the state.

We now enumerate the dominant theoretical uncertainties to the fine-structure energy contributions

En(fsj) (a more detailed account can be found in Ref. [59]). The first comes from the error of the coefficient

B6(n0 j), which leads to an error of order  0(2.0 kHz)/n3 (for other energy levels the error is smaller).

The second comes from the uncertainty in rp. For instance, a 1 per mille error in the determination of

the proton radius produces a shift of order  0(2.0 kHz)/n3 in the energy levels. The third comes from

the coefficient C50 of Eq. (3.14), which is presumed to be ±30  0, and which leads to an uncertainty

of  0(1.0 kHz)/n3.

The

fourth

comes

from

uncomputed

terms

of

order

me7 ln 1/

×

me M

.

Following

[59, 58], the error associated with this term is assumed to yield an uncertainty of order  0(0.7 kHz)/n3.

An additional uncertainty associated with D71 has now been resolved by Ref. [75] and does not need to

be included. All other uncertainties listed in Ref. [59] are more than one order of magnitude smaller.

Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the theoretical expressions collected in this review are different with respect to those in Refs. [59, 58], as we neglect terms that may introduce some model dependence, or that are of the same order as these. Numerically, the differences are irrelevant (of the order of 0.4 kHz, 0.02 kHz, and 0.002 kHz for 1S, 2S and 2P states), showing that this is a safer way to proceed.

3.3 Hydrogen hyperfine splitting
The hyperfine splitting of the ground state of hydrogen is one of the most accurate measurements made by mankind [76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83] with the result

Ehexypd,HF(1S) = 1420.405751768(1) MHz ,

(3.30)

which we take from the average of Ref. [84].
Since then, there has been a continuous effort to derive this number from theory. The first five digits of this number can be reproduced by the theory of an infinitely massive proton (except for the 1/M prefactor of the Fermi term incorporating the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton) and a nonrelativistic lepton, systematically incorporating the relativistic corrections of the latter. A summary of these pure QED computations can be found in Refs. [85, 84, 56, 59]. Particularly detailed is the account of Refs. [56, 57], which we take for reference. Such computation has reached (partial) O(me8)

the O() corrections.

Besides those, there are pure QED recoil corrections of O

On top of these, there are recoil corrections of higher orders, as well as corrections due to the hadronic structure of the proton. Similarly to the discussion we had in previous sections for the Lamb shift in regular hydrogen, it would be helpful to organize such computations/results using EFT techniques designed for few-body atomic physics such as NRQED and potential NRQED, as these theories profit from the hierarchy of scales that we have in the problem. Nevertheless, this has not yet been done. What has been done already is to relate this result with the Wilson coefficients that appear in NRQED. This was done in [86]. The result can be summarized in the following expression

where the second line is the contribution associated with the TPE correction minus its point-like contributions that are already included in the first line of Eq. (3.33) (see [86] for details).
The comparison of this theoretical result with the experimental number allows to determine (a specific part of) the Wilson coefficient of the four-fermion operator of the NRQED Lagrangian (a preliminary number was already obtained in Refs. [10, 87] (see also [29])), which we name c¯p4,eTPE:

It differs from cp4,eTPE by O(3) effects (note that cp4,eTPE is of order 2). Alternatively, one can determine this Wilson coefficient using dispersion relations. See the discussion

3.4 Muonic hydrogen hyperfine splitting

The EFT for the muonic hydrogen hyperfine splitting is available and the computation in the EFT was
done in [86]. Similarly to muonic hydrogen Lamb shift, several of the computations were made before and a summary of these results for the 2S hyperfine can be found in [88] (see also [89]). Similarly to the previous section, we define23

With these definitions, the 1S hyperfine splitting energy shift reads

Epthµ,HF(1S) = 183.788(7) meV + (1 + 0.0040)E¯pTµP,HEF(1S) ,

(3.37)

where the error in the first term is the expected size of the O(mµ6) uncomputed corrections (either related to the electron vacuum polarization effects or to higher-order recoil corrections).
For the 2S hyperfine splitting energy shift, one has

Epthµ,HF(2S) = 22.9579(8) meV + (1 + 0.0033)E¯pTµP,HEF(2S) ,

(3.38)

where, again, the error in the first term is the expected size of the O(mµ6) uncomputed corrections (either related to the electron vacuum polarization effects or to higher-order recoil corrections).

4 Observables. Low-Q2 limits of lepton-proton scattering

In this section, we describe low-momentum transfer limits of the elastic lepton-proton scattering (Q2 m2µ, m2). We obtain expressions valid in the lepton nonrelativistic limit:

=

E2 - m2li |k| =

1.

E

E

(4.1)

In this limit, the lepton-proton cross section can be written in terms of the same Wilson coefficients

that appear in (muonic) hydrogen spectroscopy. This allows for a smooth and controlled connection

with spectroscopy analyses. To cover the kinematic range of modern electron-proton and muon-proton scattering experiments, we relax the condition of nonrelativistic leptons:  1. We reproduce known

results for point-particle contributions and extend them to a general kinematic setup.

4.1 Non-relativistic lepton(muon)-proton scattering

We consider first the kinematics of the elastic scattering of a lepton on the proton (nucleus) target at
rest, which defines the laboratory frame: p = (M, 0), k = (E, k), p = (Ep, k - k ), k = (E , k ), and the lepton scattering angle is lab. The cross section of the lepton-proton scattering at tree level is conveniently expressed as

with the relativistic lepton velocity  in Eq. (4.1). The traditional Mott result corresponds to the scattering of the relativistic lepton on the infinitely heavy source of a Coulomb field. In the nonrelativistic limit of the lepton,   0, we obtain the traditional Rutherford formula.
The dominant (not suppressed by powers of ) structure effects of the spin-1/2 baryon are accounted for by introducing the Sachs electric and magnetic form factors GE and GM defined in Sec. 2.7.1 in the differential cross section as [92]

(4.5)

To reproduce the point-like particle result of Eq. (4.2), one has to make the replacement GE  1 and GM  1.
We now consider the incorporation of O() corrections. Some of them are already encoded in the Sachs form factors. This makes Eq. (4.5) to be ill-defined because of the infrared divergences of the
proton and/or muon vertices. Such divergences are regulated by the real emission of soft photons from the proton known as soft bremsstrahlung with photons of energy below E. In other words, the observable of µp  µp scattering is actually (see, for instance, the discussion in [91, 27]):

of O() corrections. This means that we will restrict the discussion to the kinematic situation when

Note that, for simplicity, in these two terms we have incorporated the contribution associated with the

vertex correction, which in the language of effective theory corresponds to a "hard" contribution, and

it is incorporated in the Wilson coefficients of the proton and muon. These Wilson coefficients have

been computed using dimensional regularization and renormalized in the MS scheme. This is the same

way in which we have done the computation of the soft diagrams drawn in Fig. 5. Some details of such

computation are given in Appendix A.

In the language of nonrelativistic EFTs, this term corresponds to a potential loop. Indeed, TPE could

be split into potential, soft and hard contributions (even if it has not been computed in this way):

TpoPiEnt-like = pot + soft + hpaorindt-like.

(4.15)

The eventual advantage of doing this splitting is that one can deal with one scale at a time. Moreover, the nonperturbative dynamics gets encoded in the hard term. The different terms would then read

(4.19)

The expression above has correct relativistic and recoil terms at orders Q, Q2 ln Q2 and Q2 for targets with structure. As before, Q2 terms can be absorbed into the Wilson coefficients ds() and ch3ad, where ch3ad is dominated by modes with energy of order m. The determination of this contribution can be found in [29] for muonic hydrogen, and here in Eq. (5.12) for regular hydrogen.
These results could be obtained from diagrammatic computations of the EFTs presented in Sec. 2.1
and Sec. 2.8. In particular, note that all the hadronic corrections that we have considered appear in the same combination as in Ddhad, as it should be (see Eq. (2.89)). Therefore, the hadronic corrections are the same as in muonic hydrogen spectroscopy.
Finally, we can perform the same analysis for the scattering of a nonrelativistic proton and a non-
relativistic electron. The computation is identical. We have to eliminate all contributions associated
with the electron in the previous computation first, we then replace the muon by the electron, and then
reintroduce the vacuum polarization of the muon in Eq. (4.12). Again, all hadronic corrections appear in the same combination as in Ddhad, as it should be (see Eq. (2.89)). Therefore, the hadronic corrections are the same as in regular hydrogen spectroscopy. We can also relate these Wilson coefficients with the
Wilson coefficients that appear in the muon-proton sector. The Wilson coefficients of LN have the same hadronic content in both regular and muonic hydrogen. Therefore, up to terms dependent on the mass of the lepton (which are suppressed by powers of ), they yield the same proton radius. The hadronic vacuum polarization effects are also equal in both theories (with the same caveat as before). Note, on
the other hand, that the TPE is different, it they depends on the mass of the lepton at the leading non-vanishing order in .

4.2 Relativistic lepton(muon)-proton scattering

The results of the previous section provide a rigorous connection between the non-perturbative effects
that appear in spectroscopy and those that appear in lepton-proton scattering. Unfortunately, such
kinematic situation is not fulfilled by the experimental setup of forthcoming muon-proton scattering
experiments. For the MUSE experiment [24], the three-momentum of the incoming muon is of the order of muon mass, 115-210 MeV, and it will probe the momentum transfer region Q2 = 0.0016 - 0.08 GeV2. Therefore, in this situation, the lepton has to be treated relativistically. In the case of the COMPASS++/AMBER experiment [26], the lepton is ultrarelativistic ( 1), since the energy of the incoming lepton changes in the range 50-200 GeV and the transfer momentum will reach Q2 = 0.001 - 0.02 GeV2. For the general kinematics of the MUSE experiment, the use of HBET applied to the muon-proton sector, as worked out in [10, 7], could be appropriate (see Sec. 2.3). The reason is that the pion mass scale is of the order of the incoming energy of the lepton, and of the order of Q2. Note that this is a problem for the attempts to construct an EFT for the MUSE experiment made in [98, 99],
where the pion particle, and other close-by degrees of freedom, are not incorporated in the Lagrangian.
We may consider a specific kinematic setup of the MUSE experiment and assume that, in such corner, µ 1 but still keeping the muon relativistic. This kinematic regime is closer to the one considered in the previous section. In the kinematic regime where p and µ are small, we can always keep the linear powers in these parameters and neglect those that are of generic order  2. In this particular kinematic setup, the only open channel is the elastic process. This means that the relevant
effective theory can be written in terms of the proton and the lepton, even if the lepton needs to be treated relativistically. In principle, one would think that keeping µ 1 would guarantee that all hadronic effects should appear as Wilson coefficients of the appropriate effective theory, as there are no
dynamical hadronic degrees of freedom as asymptotic states. Nevertheless, one cannot simply elliminate the pion while keeping the lepton relativistic. Since E is still kept dynamical, there is entanglement with the pion mass. At present, there is no effective theory that profits from the constraint µ 1. We have discussed possible (to-be-constructed) effective theories that could describe such kinematic
regime efficiently in Secs. 2.4 and 2.5. Irrespectively of the construction of the effective theory, it is worth seeing what is known at present. Several terms can be computed with arbitrary  without further complications. The corrections corresponding to the real radiation for a general  can be found in [27, 100, 101, 102, 103]. They read

These equations have been obtained in the limit µ = Q2/m2µ, p = Q2/M 2 1 keeping  arbitrary otherwise (in particular, E could be much larger than Q). In the nonrelativistic limit   0, the results of the previous section are recovered. In particular, in the nonrelativistic limit for the muon (  0), Eq. (4.21) reduces to Eq. (4.9) for s(oµf)t. Proton structure effects do not show up at this level of precision in s(oµf)t or in s(opfµt). Note also that cD(µ)MS() and c(Fµ) include O() radiative corrections. We choose to rewrite them in this way to make the connection with the previous section smooth, but it should be
kept in mind that the computation is not performed with an effective theory with nonrelativistic muons
and its corresponding Wilson coefficients.
The TPE correction is more complicated. Here, structure effects will eventually show up. To simplify
the problem, we first consider the point-like contribution. The QED limit of TPE in Eq. (4.7) for the

The expressions above have correct relativistic and recoil terms at orders Q and Q2 ln Q2 for targets with structure. The Q2 term contains structure effects and contributions from magnetization of the

(4.33)

(4.35)

It would be interesting to derive TstPr E from the suitable effective theory. We emphasize that it is in this, four-fermion part, where there are differences with respect to the spectroscopy computation, whereas
the bilinear part (where the proton radius is) remains the same.

4.3 Ultrarelativistic lepton(electron)-proton scattering
We now repeat the discussion of the previous section replacing the scattered lepton from muon to electron. In this case, we have an opposite relation between the scale of momentum transfer and the lepton mass. We kept Q2 m2µ in the previous section, whereas now we are in the opposite situation: Q2 m2e (but still keeping Q2 m2µ, m2). Electrons are typically ultrarelativistic in electron-proton scattering experiments. For instance, high-statistics Mainz data [107, 94] was taken with beam energies
38

between 180 and 855 MeV covering the momentum transfer range Q2 = 0.004 - 1 GeV2, while the
recent PRad experiment at JLab [108] was performed at beam energies 1.1 and 2.2 GeV covering Q2 = 0.00021 - 0.06 GeV2. Two other experiments are going to perform measurements at lower beam energies: 30-70 MeV with Q2 = 10-5-3×10-4 GeV2 by ProRad experiment [109, 110], and 20-60 MeV with Q2 = 0.0003 - 0.008 GeV2 by ULQ2 experiment at Tohoku University [111]. Nevertheless, we still
can profit from several results obtained in the previous sections. The point-like result of Eq. (4.2) is
the same and can be simplified noting that 0  0,   T as

(4.36)

where the same substitution applies also after the inclusion of the proton form factors as in Eq. (4.5). Similarly to Sec. 4.1, we organize the cross section and all O() corrections in the following way:

d d

s(opf)t + Z2

s(oef)t + VP + v(ee)rt

s(opfet) + TPE

+ O(2, p2) . (4.37)

The structure of the O() corrections is similar to the one before, though in some cases the explicit expressions are quite different since now we take the lepton to be ultrarelativistic.
To include the electron vacuum polarization correction, we also make the replacement of Eq. (4.8):

in the first term of Eq. (4.37). The vacuum polarization correction from heavier particles, VP, is the
same as in the muon-proton scattering, i.e., it is given by Eq. (4.12). The vertex correction on the proton side s(opf)t can be obtained from Eq. (4.21), replacing the muon
by the electron and taking the ultrarelativistic limit   1 for the electron:

The QED vertex correction on the electron side in the limit Q2 m2e cannot be described by the Wilson coefficients of the nonrelativistic theory as in Eq. (4.21). It is now given by the following

For the determination of the TPE contribution, it is convenient to consider first the case of two

point-like spin-1/2 particles. The low momentum transfer limit of the TPE correction in the scattering

of two point-like spin-1/2 particles with mass M and vanishing mass me, i.e., Q2 by [112, 113, 114]

The expressions above have correct coefficients at orders Q, Q2 ln2 Q2 for targets with structure. Note
that we could also reproduce the vertex corrections, radiation of soft photons and infrared pieces of the TPE term by taking the low-Q2 limit of expressions from [27], where the author formulates the
computation of the radiative corrections in a SCET approach. Inelastic intermediate states contribute to Q2 ln Q term as well [112, 114, 115]. This correction,
TinPelE, is expressed as the photon energy E integral over the total photoabsorption cross section on the proton T (E):

starting from the pion production threshold. To obtain the resulting correction up to Q2 ln Q terms, TinPelE should be added to TpoPiEnt-like in Eq. (4.37), i.e., TPE = TpoPiEnt-like + TinPelE + O(p).

5 Determination of the low-energy constants
In the previous sections, we have given theoretical expressions for the Lamb shift in regular and muonic hydrogen. We have also given theoretical expressions for the electron-proton and muon-proton elastic
40

scattering in some specific kinematic situations. In these theoretical expressions, the nonperturbative physics associated with hadronic scales is encoded in coefficients that can be related to Wilson coefficients of the appropriate EFT. Later, expressions valid in kinematic configurations realizable in modern or near-future elastic lepton-proton scattering experiments (not directly obtained from EFTs) were derived. We now review some determinations of the proton radius (but we also briefly discuss other Wilson coefficients). The relative precision of these determinations of the proton radius is of order .
As a matter of principle, it should be possible to derive these Wilson coefficients directly from QCD. Thus, they should be pure functions of the light quark masses and QCD. Nevertheless, at present, it is not possible to obtain accurate numbers for them from first-principle computations. Numerical lattice simulations of QCD, though rapidly evolving, are still in their early stages, and produce numbers with large errors for these Wilson coefficients. We show a set of recent determinations of the electromagnetic proton radius in Fig. 9, and in Fig. 10 for the magnetic proton radius squared, rM2 . Note that some of these determinations are not genuine determinations of the electromagnetic proton radius, since they only compute the isovector part of the proton radius, and take the isoscalar part from the experiment to produce predictions for the proton radii. They also suffer (with the exception of [116]) from the same problems that direct fits to elastic electron-proton data: one has to perform extrapolations to Q2  0, which is one of the main sources of (uncontrolled) uncertainty in these analyses (see the discussion in forthcoming sections). Another issue that limits the accuracy of present lattice determinations, in comparison with the determinations below, is that these lattice determinations of the proton radius do not incorporate O() corrections. Therefore, they cannot compete, at present, with the precision of theoretical expressions one has for spectroscopy and lepton-proton scattering.

5.1 Chiral perturbation theory

Once one is giving up direct QCD computations, the next most rigorous approach is to compute the

Wilson coefficients using chiral perturbation theory. Nevertheless, the accuracy one can reach within

this framework is limited. It can only predict the nonanalytic dependence in the light quark masses

(and the nonanalytic dependence in Nc, the number of colors, if working in the large Nc limit). For the case of the electric proton charge radius, the leading contribution is the chiral logarithm, but the

constant term cannot be fixed by the theory. Therefore, chiral perturbation theory alone can only give

the order of magnitude of the proton radius. For other radii, the situation is potentially better. If we

are below the two-pion production threshold in the t channel, the form factors are analytic functions in

Q2. Therefore, the series is convergent and truncating the series by a polynomial is not a problem if the

error of the unknown coefficients can be estimated. The high-order coefficients of the Taylor expansion

are determined (with relative) higher and higher accuracy by the first singularity closest to the origin

(this is due to a theorem in complex variable by Darboux (1878)). The leading scaling in the pion mass

of these radii is the following (we remind that  = M - M ):

In Fig. 10, and in Table 1, we give the values of these radii as predicted by pure chiral perturbation

theory, and after including the contributions associated with the Delta particle (which can be motivated

by a large Nc analysis). In order to estimate the error, the following scaling was taken [29]: m

Therefore,

a 50% uncertainty is associated with the pure chiral computation. Leaving aside the Delta, the splitting

with the next resonances suggests a mass gap of order QCD  500-770 MeV depending on whether

one considers the Roper resonance or the . Similarly, it is also taken mK  QCDms  500 MeV of

as the uncertainties of the pure chiral and the Delta-related contribution respectively, and adds these

errors linearly for the final error. This gives the expected size of the uncomputed corrections, which is

taken as the error of the computation. A similar analysis yields the error quoted in Eq. (5.5) below.

For r2k M/E with large k, it is likely that the error is smaller than the one quoted in Table 1. This error is estimated using the size of the ratios of the pion and/or Delta-Nucleon mass difference

with respect to higher resonances [29]. Nevertheless, it is expected that there should be some kind of

suppression in k, the power of the radii. This is worth being investigated further in the future. Indeed,

the importance of the Delta resonance becomes smaller and smaller as k increases. General analytic

expressions for these coefficients to arbitrary order can be found in [29]. These coefficients are derived

from the Sachs form factors computed in [63, 123, 124]. The numerical values at low orders can be

found in [31]. Some of the numerical values of these coefficients at higher order were communicated by

one of us to one of the authors of [125] before its publication.

Note that these predictions for the radii do not include electromagnetic corrections. Therefore, they

cannot reach O() precision (in practice, the hadronic error is larger and masks possible O() effects).

The odd powers of the moments of the charge distribution of the proton are obtained (defined)

electric Sachs form factor fitted to more sophisticated functions [133, 131].27 The latter fit claims to be the most accurate. Nevertheless, we observe large differences, bigger than the errors. This is especially worrisome for large n, since the chiral prediction is expected to give the dominant contribution of rn for n  3. In this respect, the chiral result may help to shape the appropriate fit function and, thus, to discriminate between different options, as well as to assess uncertainties. The impact of choosing different fit functions can be fully appreciated, for instance, in the different values of the electric proton charge radius obtained in Ref. [107] versus Ref. [5] from direct fits to the ep scattering data. Such values differ by around 3 standard deviations. Even more worrisome is the fact that the larger the n, the more sensitive is the determination of r2n+1 to the subtraction terms included to render these objects to be finite for odd powers of 2n + 1. This should be contrasted with the fact that, on general grounds, one expects the charge/Zemach moments will be more and more sensitive to the chiral region for n  . We stop the discussion here, but the reason for such large discrepancies should be further investigated.
The other Wilson coefficients that appear in the observables we are considering in this review are c3 and c4 (see Eqs. (2.71) and (2.72)). ch3ad encodes all the hadronic effects to the spin-independent four-fermion Wilson coefficient. At O(2), it is generated by the TPE contribution. Since ch3ad depends
27The agreement with [133] for n = 7 is accidental. We have checked that the growth with n is different with respect to the chiral prediction.

linearly on the lepton mass, it is dominated by the infrared dynamics and diverges linearly in the chiral limit. This produces an extra mli/m suppression with respect to its natural size, and allows us to compute the leading pure-chiral and Delta-related effects in a model-independent way. The complete matching computation between HBET and NRQED was made in Ref. [29] to which we refer for details (partial results can be found in [7, 28], and in Ref. [135] in the context of relativistic baryon effective theory). Overall, in Ref. [29] the following result was obtained for muonic hydrogen

These terms were computed using different techniques. cB3 orn is proportional to r3 (2) at leading order. To compute this object accurately requires a very precise knowledge of the elastic form factors,
as a very precise cancellation of the point-like contributions should occur (for some determinations of this quantity see [138, 137]). The attempts to compute cp3ol using dispersion relations require the introduction of momentum-dependent subtraction functions to make the dispersion relation integrals
convergent (assuming Regge behavior as discussed in Section 2.7.2). Such functions cannot be deduced
from experiment, nor theory, without extra assumptions [139, 140, 104, 141], and, therefore, introduce
some model dependence, which is difficult to quantify, as emphasized in Ref. [142]. The determination
in Ref. [136], used in [2], suffers from this problem. Even though the low-energy behavior of the forward virtual Compton tensor was computed to O(p4), this does not reflect in an improved determination of the polarizability correction, since an effective dipole form factor is used, not only at the  mass scale, but also at the chiral scale. This problem also introduces a model dependence in the error estimate of
the subtraction term. For comparison, we show different values for the subtraction term obtained in the literature in Table 3.29

The dispersion relation motivated determinations of cp3ol use the computations for the subtraction term discussed above. The analysis of Ref. [135] has a different status. In this reference, the polarizability correction was computed using BPT with only pions. Such computation treats the baryon relativistically. The result incorporates some subleading effects, which are sometimes used to give an estimate of higher-order effects in HBPT. Nevertheless, the computation also assumes that a theory

with only baryons and pions is appropriate at the proton mass scale. This should be taken with due caution. Still, it would be desirable to have a deeper theoretical understanding of the difference with the HBET (with only pions) result, which may signal that relativistic corrections are important for the polarizability contribution. In any case, the BPT computation differs from the pure chiral HBET result by around 50% (this means around 1.5 times the error used for the chiral contribution in HBET, once effects associated with the Delta particle are incorporated in the calculation), which is reasonable. We show these results in Table 4 (for convenience we directly write the correction to the Lamb shift).

We can split the contribution to the fine-splitting energy into polarizability and Born contributions, as in Eq. (5.6), to find separate predictions for each term.31 The result for the polarizability contribution approaches very reasonably the logarithmic result obtained in [7] where it is found (using the same normalization as in Table 5) ETPE = -66.5 Hz for only pions, and ETPE = -77.6 including the Delta (to compare with the two first entries in the second column of Table 5). In Table 5, we quote the result for the polarizability from [62] and for the Born contribution from [134] which are collected together in Ref. [57]. The reference [134] is quoted for the polarizability in [59] where, however, no estimate is given for the Born correction. Other estimates for just the polarizability term can be found in [146, 147, 143] obtaining similar numbers.32 A more recent determination of the TPE in hydrogen using a dispersion relation analysis of the Mainz data without modeling of the Q2 dependence of the unpolarized proton structure functions and using the proton charge radius from muonic hydrogen can be found in [144]. In Table 5, we display these results. We observe that, just as in muonic hydrogen, while each contribution is separately quite different from the determination in the chiral theory, the total TPE are perfectly compatible among the different determinations.
30Strictly speaking, this is only true if the Rydberg constant has already been determined. In the determination of the Rydberg constant from the very precise 1S-2S energy difference measurement [145], such contribution has to be taken into account.
31The Born contribution was actually also computed in [7]. The result is correct for the pure chiral case but incorrect for the correction including the Delta particle. The correct expression can be found in [29].
32Note that the polarizability term suffers from the same drawbacks as in the case of muonic hydrogen, in particular the uncontrolled dependence on the subtraction function.

5.2 rp. Dispersion relation motivated fits of form factors
As the precision one may reach with pure chiral perturbation theory computations is limited (if one tries to increase the precision, new counterterms appear that cannot be determined by theory), one may think of alternative approaches. All of them need extra experimental input. One of them is the use of dispersion relations to describe the form factors. In other words, to use parameterizations of the form factors that satisfy Eqs. (2.38). This ensures that such parameterizations fulfill unitarity, analyticity and crossing symmetry by construction. Note that chiral perturbation theory computations also enjoy these properties, within the accuracy of the computation, for small momentum transfers. If the parameterizations used for the dispersion relation implemented chiral symmetry, they should coincide (up to the accuracy chiral symmetry has been implemented in those dispersion-relation motivated parameterizations) with chiral perturbation theory computations at low momentum transfer. Even if chiral symmetry is implemented, the freedom one has in parameterizing the form factors is enormous. In practice, physically-motivated (but not model independent) parameterizations of the imaginary part of the form factors are used. In order for such analyses to be useful, they need experimental input to determine the parameters that are introduced in such parameterizations. One such analysis can be found in [4], where fits are performed simultaneously to space-like and time-like experimental data. The experimental data in the space-like region corresponds to the real part of the form factors. It is obtained from elastic electron-proton scattering, whereas the imaginary parts are constrained by the proton-proton annihilation. The result obtained for the electric proton charge radius in Ref. [4] was rp = 0.844+-00..000048 or rp = 0.830+-00..000058 depending on the parameterization of the high-energy part. Indeed, the difference between both numbers gives a lower bound of the error associated with the form chosen for the parameterization of the data at high energies.
Since then, several analyses have been performed along similar lines but trying to include more chiral structure in physically-motivated parameterizations of the imaginary part and/or fitting to more recent data of the form factors. In these more recent analyses, the experimental data in the time-like region is not directly used in the fits but only the one in the Euclidean, which is more precise. Updates by the Bonn group can be found in [5], where the value rp = 0.84+-00..11 fm was obtained after fitting the dispersion-relation motivated parameterizations to the Mainz data. A more recent update can be found in [130], where the PRad data was added to the previous fit and the following values were reported: rp = 0.838+-00..000054+-00..000043 fm and r2 M = 0.847 ± 0.004 ± 0.004 fm.
Other groups have also applied combinations of chiral symmetry and dispersion relations to fit Mainz
48

data, like the one in [125]. In this reference, they did not dare to try to determine the lowest radii, i.e., rp, but only higher radii. In this reference, it was said that the higher-order derivatives depend on the  and w mass and the two-pion threshold. We argue that these higher radii should mainly depend on the singularity closest to the origin, the two-pion threshold in this case. This seems to be confirmed by
Table 1. In more recent analysis [148] by the same group, the authors gave indeed a value for the proton radius: rp = 0.844(7) fm and in [129] for its magnetic counterpart: r2 M = 0.850 ± 0.001 ± 0.010 fm.
We show these numbers for the proton radius in Fig. 11 in comparison with the muonic hydrogen determinations. The values for rM2 reviewed in this section can be found in Fig. 10.

We compare to the values obtained in muonic hydrogen from an EFT analysis rp = 0.8413(15) fm [51] and the CREMA determination rp = 0.84087(39) fm [2], and to the averaged value reported by CODATA06 rp = 0.8768(69) fm [3].
5.3 rp. Pure fits of electron-proton scattering data without dispersionrelation motivated parameterization
The main problems in determinations of the proton radius from fits to electron-proton scattering data are choosing the functional form, and the range of energies, to be used in the fit. At present, experiments have not reached Q2 low enough to directly fit the proton radius, and one has to extrapolate to reach the Q2  0 limit. In the previous section, the way out from this problem has been the use of dispersion relations and the use of physically motivated parameterizations for the imaginary part of the form factors. These parameterizations, however, unavoidably introduce some degree of model dependence. This has the problem that it is not easy, or possible, to assess the error to model-dependent analyses. If
49

one restricts to direct fits to electron-proton data, and without extra constraints, the parameterization of the form factors is arbitrary, and so is the range of Q2 used for the fits. Nevertheless, one can find strong arguments for why one should focus on the low-Q2 part of the data in order to extract the proton charge radius. The charged-pion production threshold at Q2 = -4m2  -0.078 GeV2 results in a branch cut in the analytically continued form factor. Thus, one can seriously doubt attempts [107, 126, 127] at fitting (by polynomials or other functions, such as splines) data beyond the value of Q2 = 0.078 GeV2, and having confidence in an accurate determination of the slope of GE(Q2) at Q2 = 0. Note that this problem also affects most lattice determinations discussed above. Another point of concern is that at higher Q2 the model dependence of the TPE contribution is expected to affect more the fits. Fits that include higher-Q2 MAMI data [107] also require floating 31 normalization constants, and the floating of
these constants leads to considerable flexibility in the fits, which also makes determination of the higherorder moments more difficult. However, concentrating only on low-Q2 data (Q2 < 0.078 GeV2) has not allowed for an accurate determination of rp, since this data cannot determine the necessary higher moments (in particular, r2 M and r4 E) to sufficient accuracy to allow for a precise extrapolation to Q2=0 of the required first derivative of GE(Q2). Thus, out of necessity, many attempts have been made to fit scattering data up to higher Q2 to determine rp while simultaneously determining the higher-order moments.
In Ref. [149], it was shown that values of rp ranging from 0.84 to 0.89 fm are possible from acceptable fits of the MAMI data, with the value of rp depending on the functional forms of GE and GM that are used for the extrapolation to Q2=0. In particular, the higher moments assumed by the different functional forms lead to a wide range of rp values. The implication of that work [149] is that a precise value of rp cannot be obtained from electron-proton elastic scattering, unless precise lower-Q2 data becomes available, or unless there are external constraints on the functional form of GE(Q2) and GM(Q2). The latter (external constraints on the functional forms) can be obtained from chiral perturbation theory.
This was the approach followed in [31]. If we are below the two-pion production threshold in the t
channel, the function is analytic. Therefore, the series is convergent and truncating the series by a
polynomial is not a problem if the error of the unknown coefficients can be estimated, which is the case using the prediction from chiral perturbation theory. The first derivative of GM(Q2) and the second derivative of GE(Q2) at Q2=0 (which are proportional to the magnetic and electric moments r2 M and r4 E, respectively) are of particular importance in this extrapolation to Q2=0. The result of the fit in [31] can be found in Fig. 11.
It would be interesting to see how the situation changes with recent measurements. On the one
hand, we have a recent measurement at MAMI using the radiative return method [150]. Neverthe-
less, at present, the errors are pretty large. The situation is quite different with the recent mea-
surement by the PRad collaboration [108]. This is the first electron scattering experiment to use a
magnetic-spectrometer-free method along with a windowless hydrogen gas target, which overcomes sev-
eral limitations of previous electron-proton scattering experiments and has reached unprecedentedly
small scattering angles. The value for the proton radius obtained in [108] was rp = 0.831(7)stat(12)syst. This number was obtained using a simple Pade[1,1] rational function for GpE:

GpE (Q2 )

=

1 + p1Q2 1 + p2Q2

.

(5.13)

This determination has been criticized by Paz in [151] and by Horbatsch in [152]. In the former the statistical error is claimed to be larger. The latter mentions that the PRad data would be more appropriated to fit higher moments. Also, in [128], it is mentioned that the experiment does not provide complete uncertainty correlations and uses too small number of coefficients in z-expansion fits. It is also worth mentioning this last reference for an alternative fit of higher moments of the Sachs form factors. In this reference, the authors take the proton radius obtained from the muonic hydrogen Lamb shift as the accepted value, and determine the higher moments using this constrain in fits to elastic electron-

50

proton scattering data. The incorporation of the value of the proton radius from muonic hydrogen in the fits seems to bring higher moments r4 E and r2 M (for r4 M the errors are too large) closer to chiral perturbation theory predictions if applying the fit methods and parameterizations used in [128] to MAMI data. They agree within one sigma. See Table 1 and Fig. 10.
Finally, we would like to mention a series of proposed experiments that could measure the proton radius or find violations of lepton universality. One example of the latter is the measurement of leptonpair photoproduction on the hydrogen target [153, 154, 155]. Another possibility, to which not much attention has been paid, is the use of inverse kinematics experiments (see for instance [30]) that would allow to reach Q2 values four orders of magnitude smaller than nowadays experiments. Finally, two other experiments are going to perform measurements at lower beam energies: 30 - 70 MeV with Q2 = 10-5 -3×10-4 GeV2 by ProRad experiment [109, 110] and 20-60 MeV with Q2 = 0.0003-0.008 GeV2 by ULQ2 experiment at Tohoku University [111]. For these experiments, it is worth emphasizing that a very high precision should be achieved as we approach Q2 = 0, otherwise it will not be possible to measure the slope but only the absolute normalization of the proton charge.
5.4 rp. Fits to regular hydrogen
An alternative to direct determinations of the form factors from lepton-proton scattering is the use of spectroscopy, in particular of energy differences that can be measured with enough precision to be sensitive to the proton radius. The use of hydrogen spectroscopy has the advantage that Q2 is very small. This line of research has been quite successful, and the accurate measurements obtained in a series of experiments have produced competitive determinations of the proton radius (see references in Figs. 12 and 13). The existing situation before the appearance of the proton radius puzzle is summarized in Fig. 12. Such measurements had large individual errors but after the averaging of [59] the error shrank considerably. The resulting average favoured a larger value for the proton radius than the result one obtains from muonic hydrogen Lamb shift. The situation has changed since. New measurements have been performed. We summarize the new measurements, and their comparison with the 2012 average, in Fig. 13. There are two measurements of the 1S-3S shift by the MPQ group [156]. The second measurement overshadows the first, being considerably more precise. This measurement is particularly interesting as there is also a recent measurement of the same energy shift by the Paris group [157]. These two measurements disagree with each other at the two sigma level. The measurement by the MPQ group [156] would confirm the result from muonic hydrogen (though slightly bigger by a little bit more than one standard deviation), whereas the Paris group experiment [157] would confirm the value obtained by the 2012 hydrogen average.33 This may point to a systematic problem in the set of measurements made by the Paris group. This view is strongly reinforced by the two recent and independent experiments of the 2S-4P [158], and 2S-2P [159] energy shifts. These two measurements are in perfect accordance with the muonic hydrogen result and disagree with the CODATA06 value.
As we have mentioned in Sec. 2.8, the EFT analysis makes it evident that the combination of hadronic effects that are measured in the Lamb shift of hydrogen or muonic hydrogen is Eq. (2.89). Therefore, we have a combination of the proton radius, the TPE correction, and the hadronic vacuum polarization effects. Nevertheless, the TPE correction and the hadronic vacuum polarization effects are O() suppressed. On top of that, the hadronic vacuum polarization can be obtained from other sources with enough precision (dispersion relations). For the case of the TPE correction, the fact that it is O(mli) suppressed makes such contribution negligible for the case of regular hydrogen. This is the reason why Lamb shift measurements of regular hydrogen can then be thought of as genuine measurements of the proton radius with O() precision (provided the Rydberg constant is known).
33A funny comment often mentioned in conferences is that several members of the MPQ group participated in the muonic hydrogen measurement, whereas the Paris group is the most important group in the set of experiments that contributed to the 2010 hydrogen average.

CODATA [59]. From top to bottom, the first three determinations from Lamb-shift like splittings come
from [160, 161, 162]. The next eleven values are obtained from combining the measurement of the 1S-2S interval [163] with [164] for the first two, [165] for the next two, and [166],[167],[168] for the n = 6, 8, 12 level measurements respectively. In brown the average from hydrogen spectroscopy rp = 0.8764(89) fm in [59]. We compare to the values obtained in muonic hydrogen from an EFT analysis rp = 0.8413(15) fm [51] and the CREMA determination rp = 0.84087(39) fm [2], and to the value obtained by CODATA06 rp = 0.8768(69) fm [3], and CODATA18 rp = 0.8768(69) fm.

5.5 rp. Fits to muonic hydrogen Lamb shift

At present, there have been two measurements of the muonic hydrogen Lamb shift [1, 2]. Both measure-

ments have been performed by the same group and with the same experimental setup. Similarly to what

happens with regular hydrogen, the EFT analysis makes it evident that the combination of hadronic

effects that are measured in the Lamb shift of muonic hydrogen is Eq. (2.89). Therefore, we have a

combination of the proton radius, the TPE correction, and the hadronic vacuum polarization effects.

Again, the TPE correction and the hadronic vacuum polarization effects are O() suppressed, and the

hadronic vacuum polarization can be obtained from other sources with enough precision (dispersion

relations). What is different now is that the TPE correction is much larger than in regular hydrogen.

The fact that the TPE correction is of O(mµ) makes this contribution not suppressed compared with hadronic contributions of the order of (or close to) the pion mass. Therefore, to use the muonic hydrogen

Lamb shift for determinations of the proton radius, it is compulsory to take the TPE correction from

other

sources.

In brown the average from hydrogen spectroscopy rp = 0.8764(89) fm in [59]. We compare to the values obtained in muonic hydrogen from an EFT analysis rp = 0.8413(15) fm [51] and the CREMA determination rp = 0.84087(39) fm [2], and to the value obtained by CODATA06 rp = 0.8768(69) fm [3], and CODATA18 rp = 0.8768(69) fm.

Finally, we would like to remark that if we could get the proton radius from another place, the muonic hydrogen would be an ideal place to determine ch3ad, the TPE hadronic contribution.

5.6 ch4ad from hydrogen and muonic hydrogen
For completeness, we also consider determinations of cp4e and cp4µ. ch4ad encodes all the hadronic effects to the spin-dependent four-fermion Wilson coefficients. At present, there are no lattice predictions for these quantities. With respect to chiral perturbation theory, similarly to ch3ad, this coefficient diverges in the chiral limit. Nevertheless, it only does so logarithmically (unlike in ch3ad, where the divergence was linear). Such computation can be found in Ref. [10], and gives the right order of magnitude of the Wilson coefficient, around 2/3 of the experimental number if setting the renormalization scale  = m.34 One cannot improve over this estimate with chiral perturbation theory alone, up to the price of introducing extra counterterms. An exception to this is the determination of the relation between the cp4e and cp4µ. The difference between them can indeed be determined with high accuracy using chiral perturbation
theory:

c¯p4,µTPE = c¯p4,eTPE + (c¯p4,µTPE - c¯p4,eTPE)

=

c¯p4,eTPE +

[cp4,µTPE - cp4,eTPE] + [Kpµ - Kpe]

+

O(

mµ M

)

.

(5.14)

34Strictly speaking one should distinguish between the electron-proton and the muon-proton case, but the contribution proportional to the logarithm of the mass of the lepton is small, even in the electron case, and does not alter significantly the estimate.

53

The first term can be determined from the hyperfine energy shift measurement with high precision. The constants Kpµ and Kpe that appear in the above equation are unknown at present.35 They introduce an error of around 1%, which is added to the error budget. One then approximates Eq. (5.14) as

cp4,µTPE = cp4,eTPE + [cp4,µTPE - cp4,eTPE] + O(3) .

(5.15)

The key point is that the second term within parenthesis can be determined using chiral perturbation theory accurately. This was done in Ref. [86], and the following result was obtained:

cp4,µTPE - cp4,eTPE = 2 3.68(72) .

(5.16)

For experiment-based determinations of these Wilson coefficients, the situation is the following. At present lepton-proton scattering data is not precise enough to determine these Wilson coefficients, which have to be determined from spectroscopy, or using dispersion relations. For hydrogen, the direct determination from spectroscopy yields

c¯p4,eTPE = -248.69(3) .

(5.17)

The analogous number for muonic hydrogen can be found (properly rescaled) in Fig. 14. This number is taken from Ref. [86].
Alternative determinations were obtained from dispersion relations in [53, 170, 171] (see also [56, 172, 137, 173]). In Refs. [174, 144], the author considers the difference between the hydrogen and muonic hydrogen TPE corrections to reduce uncertainties propagated from experimental measurements of the proton spin structure. Note that, the relativistic expressions were used in this case and the high-energy behavior is suppressed, which should improve the convergence, as it also does in the chiral computation. This explains the most accurate number quoted. We collect these determinations in Fig. 14. The dispersion relations formulas used in these references were given by [175, 176, 105]

6 Conclusions
We have reviewed the theoretical expressions used in different experiments for the determination of the proton radius. The observables we have considered are the elastic electron-proton scattering, the elastic muon-proton scattering, and the Lamb shift in regular and muonic hydrogen. With the help of EFTs, we have presented a unified vision of these observables. This guarantees that the same Wilson coefficients are used for those observables. For spectroscopy, this goal is completely achieved, as we have EFTs at our disposal, see Secs. 2.1, 2.2, and 2.8. These EFTs can also be used in lepton-proton scattering for some specific kinematic region. Therefore, for this specific set of observables, we can guarantee that the very same proton radius is measured in all these experiments (at least with relative

The first three results are determinations using dispersion relations: [53, 170, 171], The fourth one is the direct determination from the measurement [2] of the hyperfine splitting of the muonic hydrogen as computed in Ref. [86]. The fifth one is the determination from the combination of the measurement of hyperfine splitting of hydrogen and chiral perturbation theory [86]. The last one is the determination from the combination of the measurement of hyperfine splitting of hydrogen and dispersion relations [174, 144].
O() precision). Actually, the very same discussion applies to other (quasi-)low-energy constants that appear in these, or analogous, low-energy experiments: one can relate them with Wilson coefficients of the EFT in such a way that it can be guaranteed that we are talking about the same quantity.
The theoretical expressions for the elastic muon-proton scattering can be found in Eq. (4.7). At the end of that section, the set of changes that have to be made to obtain the theoretical expression for the case of the elastic electron-proton scattering is also explained. In Eq. (3.5), we can find the theoretical expression for the muonic hydrogen Lamb shift E(2P1/2) - E(2S1/2). For the case of regular hydrogen, there are different theoretical expressions depending on the energy difference one considers. The theoretical expressions in this case can be found in Sec. 3.2. The hadronic quantities that appear in these expressions can be related to the Wilson coefficients of the effective theory in such a way that it is guaranteed that we are talking about the same quantity. These hadronic quantities can also be related to matrix elements of QCD (expectation values of QCD operators), which therefore, could eventually be determined from lattice simulations. In all cases, the relative precision (with respect to the proton radius) is of O(), and the relative theoretical error is of O(2). This precision requires the knowledge of the hadronic TPE contribution with O(2) precision (the leading non-vanishing contribution), at least for the case of the muon-proton sector.
The above analysis clarifies the connection between (quasi-)low-energy constants that appear in physical observables and the Wilson coefficients that appear in the EFT. By posing the problem in terms of Wilson coefficients, it is easy to realize that the proton radius, and some other low-energy constants, are ambiguous once electromagnetic corrections are switched on. With nowadays precision, this is only relevant for the proton radius. But in the future, it could be an issue for other low-energy constants as well. For the particular case at hand, EFTs evidence the relevance of working in a minimal basis of operators. For the above set of experiments, it is impossible to determine, from experiment, the proton radius isolated from the TPE correction and the hadronic vacuum polarization. This is better seen in pNRQED, where these three terms combine in the Wilson coefficient of the delta potential, and
55

therefore, they always appear in the same way in observables. The kinematic regime of the lepton-proton sector where we have EFTs at our disposal is limited,
and cannot be applied in most elastic lepton-proton scattering experiments available at present, or in the near future. In Secs. 4.2 and 4.3, we have presented theoretical expressions for kinematic regions that are of relevance in those experiments. Our main constraint is that Q2 m2. These expressions cannot be directly derived from EFTs, but we have tried to connect to some extent with those EFTs. In particular, we have seen that the proton radius is the same but the TPE correction is different. We have given explicit expressions for the elastic muon-proton scattering in a kinematic situation that can be of relevance for the forthcoming experiments MUSE [24] and COMPASS [26] (see Eq. (4.7)). As far as we know, the different pieces of this expression have never been assembled together in a single paper. By using such theoretical expressions in these experiments, it would be guaranteed that the same definition of the proton radius is used (and measured) as in the other experiments that are used for the determination of the proton radius. For the case of electron-proton scattering with a relativistic electron, the resulting expression can be found in Eq. (4.37). We have also discussed possible ways to construct EFTs that would efficiently deal with such kinematic situations in Secs. 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6.
After these theoretical discussions, we have reviewed determinations of the proton radius and other low-energy constants. Lattice determinations are maturing fast, but they are not yet precise enough. The precision of chiral computations is also limited because of the appearance of counterterms as one tries to increase the accuracy of such computations. This is particularly so for the proton radius where chiral perturbation theory can only predict the logarithmic dependence in the pion mass (on the other hand, for other radii chiral perturbation theory works better). These two approaches guarantee model independence. Alternatively, one can use experimental data to determine the proton radius. Several different experiments are available at present. By far, the most precise determination comes from the muonic hydrogen Lamb shift. The limit in the precision of this determination is given by the error of the spin-independent TPE correction to the Lamb shift, which we have discussed in the review. The initial tension between the determination of the proton radius from the muonic hydrogen Lamb shift with determinations from electron-proton scattering and hydrogen spectroscopy has faded over time. It soon became evident that previous determinations of the proton radius from elastic electron-proton scattering could not predict the proton radius with the claimed accuracy. It is now believed that the pre-muonichydrogen proton-radius determinations from electron-proton scattering did not take into account the flexibility in the possible functional form of the form factors (at least in the error analysis). The use of fits up to high energies could distort the extrapolation to Q2  0. Therefore, it is more sensible to restrict fits to the small Q2 region, but then one needs to fix the higher terms in the Q2 expansion by other means, like chiral perturbation theory, which, within one standard deviation, agree with the muonic hydrogen number. Alternative determinations fitting scattering data using dispersion relations also agree with the muonic hydrogen number. In this respect, in retrospect, one lesson learned from the muonic hydrogen Lamb shift result was that the errors associated with form factor parameterizations used for the CODATA08 average were underestimated.
The experimental situation of lepton-proton scattering has improved by the recent result in [108] (though somewhat disputed by some authors), and more experiments are expected to come both in the electron-proton and in the muon-proton sector. These last ones would be the first muon-proton scattering experiments with percent level of accuracy, and will help check universality of the lepton interactions.
With respect to the determinations from hydrogen spectroscopy, the accumulated new experimental data strongly favours the proton radius value obtained from muonic hydrogen Lamb shift. The only remaining problem is some hydrogen measurements by the Paris group, which are at the 3-sigma level of tension at most. In this respect, the 1S-3S energy shift is particularly compelling. We now have two measurements of this quantity by two different experimental collaborations, one by the Paris group [157] and the other by the MPQ collaboration [156]. This brings a venue that may help to disentangle
56

this remaining issue. Still, taking all accumulated evidence together, we cannot talk of a proton radius puzzle anymore but, at most, of a remaining tension for some experiments, which should, nevertheless, be clarified.
Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the research activity associated with the proton radius puzzle has highlighted the existence of a large variety of experiments that measure with high precision the different low-energy constants associated with the electromagnetic interaction of the proton. This asks for a unified theoretical setup to handle them. In this respect, we have also discussed in this review the determination of the spin-dependent TPE effects, which can be directly determined from spectroscopy. Other radii have also been briefly discussed.
