Smooth weight structures and birationality filtrations on motivic categories

Abstract
We study various triangulated motivic categories and introduce a vast family of aisles (these are certain classes of objects) in them. These aisles are defined in terms of the corresponding "motives" (or motivic spectra) of smooth varieties in them; we relate them to the corresponding homotopy t-structures. We describe our aisles in terms of stalks at function fields and prove that they widely generalize the ones corresponding to slice filtrations. Further, the filtrations on the "homotopy hearts" Htehfofm of the corresponding effective subcategories that are induced by these aisles can be described in terms of (Nisnevich) sheaf cohomology as well as in terms of the Voevodsky contractions --1. Respectively, we express the condition for an object of Htehfofm to be weakly birational (i.e., that its n + 1th contraction is trivial or, equivalently, the Nisnevich cohomology vanishes in degrees > n for some n  0) in terms of these aisles; this statement generalizes well-known results of Kahn and Sujatha. Next, these classes define weight structures wSs mooth (where s = (sj) are non-decreasing sequences parameterizing our aisles) that vastly generalize the Chow weight structures wChow defined earlier. Using general abstract nonsense we also construct the corresponding adjacent t-structures tsSmooth and prove that they give the birationality filtrations on Htehfofm.
Moreover, some of these weight structures induce weight structures on the corresponding n-birational motivic categories (these are the localizations by the levels of the slice filtrations). Our results also yield some new unramified cohomology calculations. Section 1, 2, and 5 were supported by the RFBR grant no. 19-31-90074.

1 Introduction
In [BoK18] the authors constructed and studied in detail the Chow weight structure wChow on the category DMReff (k) of Voevodsky's motives (and on its "stable" version DMR(k)), where k is a perfect field and R is the coefficient ring. The main advantage of this definition (in contrast to the earlier one in [Bon11]) was that it did not depend on any resolution of singularities results, and the characteristic p of k was not required to be invertible in R (if p > 0).
In the current text we consider similar (but much more general) definitions in various motivic categories, and relate the corresponding classes of objects (that are aisles) to the corresponding (well-known) homotopy t-structures thom. The filtrations given by these aisles generalize the slice and (Chow) weight ones (the latter are considered in several papers of the first author). We also consider the effective versions of our motivic categories

2

and obtain several conditions for an object from the heart of the homotopy t-structure Htehfofm to be weakly birational (see Proposition 3.2.1 and Remark 3.2.2(1)). Further, since our weight structures wSs mooth (generated by M(SmVar) j [sj], where s = sj is a non-decreasing sequence) are smashing, there exist t-structures tsSmooth (right) adjacent to wSs mooth. This allows us to prove interesting properties of our filtration on Hthefofm: the levels F i of this filtration consist of i-birational objects, and they give right adjoint functors to the embeddings Hti-bir  Htehfofm. Thus we generalize the corresponding results of [KaS17]. We also obtain a curious statement about unramified cohomology (see Proposition 4.2.8).
Let us now describe the contents of the paper. Some more information of this sort can be found at the beginnings of sections. By Deff  D we denote the motivic categories we consider.
In §2 we recall several definitions and results on triangulated categories, t-structures, and recall the motivic categories relevant to us (these are SHS1(k), SHeff (k)  SH(k), DM eff (k)  DM (k), and DAef1f (k)  DA1(k)) along with their basic properties. Further we discuss homotopy t-structures on them in a rather axiomatic manner. Some of the details are postponed until §5.
In §3 we define "smoothly generated" aisles corresponding to non-decreasing sequences s = (sj), in our motivic categories, and obtain several comparison theorems. Next, we describe these aisles in terms of stalks corresponding to function fields. Further, we consider the corresponding smooth filtrations on Htehfofm and prove some of their properties. Finally, using our results we prove that the homotopy t-structure restricts to Dn-bir.
In §4 we recall basic definitions and properties of weight structures. Next we define the main weight structures on our categories -- the As-smooth ones, and relate them to unramified cohomology. Using general existence results, we also define As-smooth t-structures (that are right adjacent to our wSefmfo,soth), and relate them to the birationality filtration on Htehfofm. Next we relate our weight structures to the corresponding n-birational motivic categories. In particular, we study the weight-exactness of the functors - n and of the localizations pn : Deff  Dn-bir.
In §5 we discuss (in more detail) some definitions and results for motivic categories different from SHeff (k)  SH(k). We explain that localizing coefficients for these categories yields new examples. This gives R-linear versions of the categories above, where R  Q; it follows that the category SH(k)+ can also be added to the examples mentioned above.

2 Preliminaries
In §2.1 we give some definitions and conventions related to (mostly) triangulated categories. In §2.2 we recall basic definitions and properties of t-structures. In §2.3 we recall some basics on various motivic categories. In §2.4 we introduce and discuss homotopy t-structures on these categories. In §2.5 we discuss our axioms mainly in the case of the categories SHeff (k)  S H (k).
2.1 Categorical definitions and notation
· Given a category B and M, N  Obj B, we say that M is a retract of N if idM can be factored through N (recall that if B is triangulated then M is a retract of N if and only if M is its direct summand).
· A subcategory D of B is said to be retraction-closed in B if it contains all B-retracts of its objects.
· The full subcategory KarB(D) of B whose objects are all B-retracts of objects of D will be called the retraction-closure of D in B. It is easily seen that KarB(D) is retraction-closed in B; if B and D are additive then KarB(D) is additive as well.
· We say that an additive category D is Karoubian if any its idempotent endomorphism is isomorphic to the composition of a retraction and a coretraction of the type M N  M  M N.
· For any A, B, C  Obj C we will say that C is an extension of B by A if there exists a distinguished triangle A  C  B  A[1]. A class P  Obj C is said to be extension-closed if it is closed with respect to extensions and contains 0.
· For X, Y  Obj C we will write X  Y if C(X, Y ) = {0}. For D, E  Obj C we write D  E if X  Y for all X  D, Y  E. Given D  Obj C we will write D for the class
{Y  Obj C : X  Y X  D}.
Dually, D is the class {Y  Obj C : Y  X X  D}.
· Given f  C(X, Y ) we will call the third vertex of (any) distinguished triangle X f Y  Z a cone of f .1
1Recall that different choices of cones are connected by non-unique isomorphisms.

· All coproducts in this paper will be small.
· Assume that C is smashing, that is, closed with respect to coproducts. For D  C (D is a triangulated category that may be equal to C) one says that P  Obj C generates D as a localizing subcategory of C if D is the smallest full strict triangulated subcategory of C that contains P and is closed with respect to C-coproducts.
· M  Obj C is said to be compact if the functor C(M, -) : C  Ab respects coproducts.
· C is said to be compactly generated if it is generated by a set of compact objects as its own localizing subcategory.
2.2 Basics on t-structures
Let us recall some notations and properties on t-structures. In contrast to the original definitions in [BBD82], our convention for t-structures will be homological.2
Definition 2.2.1. A pair of strict subcategories Ct0, Ct<0  Obj C will be said to define a t-structure t on a triangulated category C if they satisfy the following conditions.
(i) Ct0[1]  Ct0 and Ct<0[-1]  Ct<0. (ii) Ct0  Ct<0. (iii) For any M  Obj C there exists a distinguished triangle
Mt0  M  Mt<0Mt0[1]
such that Mt0  Ct0, Mt<0  Ct<0.
We also need the following auxiliary definitions.
Definition 2.2.2. 1. Ctn := Ct0[n] (resp. Ctn+1 := Ct<n := Ct<0[n]) for any integer n  Z.
2. The heart of t is the category Ht = Ct0  Ct0  C; recall that it is an abelian category.
3. We will say that t is left (resp. right) non-degenerate if iZCti = {0} (resp. iZCti = {0}). We say that t is non-degenerate if it is both left and right non-degenerate.
2Here we follow [Mor]. The homological and cohomological convention are related in the usual way: Ctn = Ct-n and Ctn = Ct-n.
5

Remark 2.2.3. 1. The triangle in axiom (iii) is essentially functorial in M. Thus, we get a well-defined functor 0 : C  Ct0 (resp. <0 : C  Ct<0) which is right (resp. left) adjoint to the inclusion functor Ct0  C (resp. Ct<0  C. Also we put n(M ) := 0(M [-n])[n] (resp. n(M ) := <0(M [n + 1])[-n - 1]).
2. The functor H0t := 0  0 sends C into Ht; it is homological (i.e., converts distinguished triangles into long exact sequences). Moreover, we will write Hnt for H0t  [-n].
3. One can easily check that t is non-degenerate if and only if the family of functors (Hnt )nZ is conservative.
4. Consider two categories C and D endowed with t-structures. One says that a functor F : C  D is left (resp. right) t-exact if it respects the t-negativity (resp. t-positivity) of objects. We will say that F is t-exact if it is both left and right t-exact.
Proposition 2.2.4. Let P  Obj C be a set of compact objects. Then there exists a unique t-structure t on C such that Ct0 is the smallest subclass of Obj C that contains P and is stable with respect to extensions, the suspension [1], and coproducts.
Proof. This is precisely Theorem A.1 of [AJS03].
Definition 2.2.5. We will call the t-structure as in the previous proposition the t-structure generated by P.
Remark 2.2.6. 1. For a t-structure given by Proposition 2.2.4 the functors 0, 0, and H0t respect coproducts (see Proposition A.2 of ibid.). 2. The t-structure as in the proposition is left non-degenerate if and only if P generates C as its own localizing subcategory (obvious; see Lemma 1.2.9 of [BoD17]).
2.3 On various motivic categories
Now we recall some basics on motivic categories. Below k will always be a perfect field of characteristic p, and D(k) is one of the motivic categories listed below; M = MD : SmVar  D(k) will denote the corresponding "D-motive" functor from the category SmVar of smooth k-varieties. We will always assume that D is triangulated monoidal with the tensor unit given
by ½D = MD(Spec(k)). Moreover, we assume that MD sends products of
varieties into tensor products.
MD will satisfy the homotopy invariance property, that is, MD(A1) = ½D.
6

Remark 2.3.1. 1. Now let us introduce some notation related to "Tate-type twists".
Firstly, we set T = Cone(MD(Gm)  MD(A1)). Below we will always assume that T is -invertible in D (yet cf. Remark 2.3.2(4) below). For C  Obj D and n  Z we set C n = C  T n and C{n} = C n [-n].
2. These twists are clearly "coherent with respect to functors that commute with M" in various motivic categories below.
Moreover, homotopy invariance implies MD(Gm) = ½D T [-1]. Fur-
thermore, it is well-known (and follows from the so-called Mayer-Viertoris
property) for the categories we consider that MD(P1) = ½D  T .
These splittings also exist in the motivic categories of the type Deff that we discuss in Remark 2.3.2(2-3) below.
· We will write SH(k) for the P1-stable motivic homotopy category, and MSH : SmVar  SH(k) for the corresponding infinite suspension spectrum functor (see [Mor], §5.1).
· We will write DM(k) for the category of Voevodsky's motives, and MDM : SmVar  DM(k) for the corresponding ("usual") DM-motive functor (see §5.1 of [Deg11] for the detail).
· We will write DA1(k) for the A1-derived category as defined in §5.3.20 of [CiD19], and MDA1 : SmVar  DA1(k) for the corresponding functor (see also §6.2 of [Mor]).
· We will write MGl - Mod(k) for the category of MGl-modules in SH(k); see Propositions 7.2.14, 7.2.18 of [CiD19], Example 1.3.1(3) of [BoD17], or §2.2 of [Deg13].
Remark 2.3.2. 1. All the categories discussed above are well known to be smashing and compactly generated by the objects MD(X){i} for X  SmVar, i  Z.
Furthermore, the functors MD factor through the corresponding subcategories of compact objects.
2. For each of these D we will write Deff (k) for the localising subcategory of D(k) generated by objects of the form M(X) for X  SmVar. Thus Deff (k) is also compactly generated by these objects.
3. We will write SHS1(k) for the S1-stable motivic homotopy category, and MSHS1 : SmVar  SHS1(k) for the corresponding infinite suspension spectrum functor (see [Mor], §4.1). The category SHS1(k) is compactly generated by the objects M(X) for X  SmVar. Note that there exists an adjunction  : SHS1(k)  SH(k) :  (see Remark 5.1.11 of [Mor]).
7

The category SHS1(k) is not equivalent to the effective category Deff for any "motivic" D. Nonetheless, by abuse of notation we will take SHS1(k) as one of the possibilities for the category Deff (k) in all the formulations in
this paper except the ones in §4.3. 4. In categories of the type Deff (k) the twists of the types - n and
-{n} are defined for n  0 only. Note also that these functors are not fully faithful on SHS1(k) (in contrast to other Deff (k)).

2.4 Homotopy t-structures: recollection

Now we introduce some definitions, which will be very important further in
this paper. We will write D for some of the motivic categories from section 2.3 and Deff for its effective version.

Definition 2.4.1. 1. Denote by tDhom the t-structure on D generated by

M(X){i} for X  SmVar, i  Z (see Definition 2.2.5).

2.

Denote

by

tDef f hom

the

t-structure

on

Def f

generated

by

M(X )

for

X  SmVar.

3. For i  Z, C  D and j  Z (resp. C  Deff and j  0) we

define the functor Cji(-) : SmVarop  Ab as X  D(M(X){j}, C[i]) (resp. X  Deff (M(X){j}, C[i])).

More generally, for any cohomological functor from D(k) to Ab and X 

SmVar, i, j  Z we define Hji(M(X)) as H(M(X){j}[-i]). 4. For i, j as above we will write Deff (M(K){j}[i], -) (resp. D(M(K){j}[i], -))

for the following functor from Deff : C  l-im Cj-i(X) (resp. for the X,k(X )=K
functor on D: C  l-im Cj-i(X)). X,k(X )=K

5. Denote by --1 the right adjoint to -{1}; this is the so-called Voevodsky contraction.3 For i > 0 the i-th iteration of --1 will be denoted by
--i.

We introduce some "axioms" characterizing homotopy t-structures on motivic categories that we consider in this paper.

(A1) Let H be a cohomological functor from D(k) to Ab and X  SmVar. Then there exists a convergent (coniveau) spectral sequence as follows:

E1p,q =

Hpq(x)  H0p+q(M(X)),

xX (p)

3Essentially following Definition 4.3.10 of [Mor]; note that the latter is equivalent to the original definition from [Voe00b]. This adjoint exists since Deff is compactly generated
(see Remark 2.3.2(2,3)), and -{1} is exact and respects coproducts.

8

where Xp is the set of points of X of codimension p  0, and for a presentation of x  Xp as lim-i Xi for Xi  SmVar we define Hpq(x) as l-imi H(M(Xi){p}[-q]).
(A2) D(k)thom0 = {C  D(k)|D(M(K){j}, C[i]) = {0} for all function fields K/k, j  Z, i > 0}.

In the effective setting one should take j  0 in Axiom (A2) instead.

Corollary 2.4.2. 1. The endofunctor (-)-1 is thom-exact.

2. The functor  : HtD  P sh(P ts, AbZ), (F ) = F0(-) (see the related definitions above) is conservative, exact, and commutes with coprod-
ucts. Here we write P ts for the set of function fields (that is, finitely generated extensions) over the base field k.

Moreover, the functor 0 : F  F00(-) is conservative on HtDeff .

3.

tDhom

and

tDef f hom

are

non-degenerate

(see

Definition

2.2.2(3)).

Proof. 1. The right thom-exactness follows from (A2). Next we note that
-{1} is right thom-exact, thus (-)-1 is also left thom-exact (as a right adjoint).
2. The description of D(k)thom0 provided by (A2) immediately yields that (F ) = 0 if F  D(k)thom0 \ D(k)thom1. Next,  commutes with coproducts, since it is defined in terms of functors corepresented by compact
objects.
To prove exactness, we apply the functor  to the exact sequence 0  F   F  F   0 in HtD. Our definitions immediately imply (F [-1]) = 0, whereas (F [1]) = 0 by (A2).
We should also prove that if F  Obj HtDeff and 0(F ) = 0 then Fi0(-) = {0} for i > 0. Firstly, F(M((Gm,K )×i)) equals l-imj F(M((Gm)×i(Xj))) for a presentation Spec(K) = lim-j Xj. We should prove that F0p+q(M((Gm,K)×i)) = {0} for p + q = 0. We take the spectral sequence as in (A1) for the variety (Gm)×i(Xj) for each j. By our assumption and (A2), the corresponding E1p,q vanish if q > 0 and p = q = 0. Further, for q < 0 (i.e., in the case p = -q) these groups vanish by the property (ii) for t-structures and the right t-exactness of -{p}. Thus F00(M((Gm)×i(Xj))) = 0 for any j, and passing to the direct limit we obtain our assertion.
3. Can be easily obtained by combining a spectral sequence argument
(Axiom (A1)) with the corresponding compact generation properties; see
Remarks 2.2.3(3) and 2.3.2(1­2).

9

It will be shown below that axioms (A1­A2) hold for all aforementioned motivic categories (and for some other ones).
2.5 The case of SH(k) and SHeff (k)
In this section, we check our axioms and discuss the related definitions for the categories SHeff (k)  SH(k) that appear to give the most interesting examples.
Definition 2.5.1. We will write i(E)j for the Nisnevich sheaf on SmVar that is associated to the presheaf Eji.
Lemma 2.5.2. 1. There exist convergent spectral sequences as in (A1) for these cases.
2. Axiom (A2) is fulfilled.
Proof. 1. See Proposition 4.3.1(I.3) and Remark 4.3.2(2) of [Bon18b] (note that the construction there was inspired by the corresponding results from [CTHK]).
2. See Proposition 5.1.1(5) of [Bon18b].
Remark 2.5.3. Thus, our axioms (A1) and (A2) above are fulfilled for SH(k) and SHeff (k). Therefore, Corollary 2.4.2 can be applied in this case as well.
Proposition 2.5.4. 1. SH(k)0 = {E  SH(k)|i(E)j = 0 f or i > 0, j  Z}.
2. SH(k)0 = {E  SH(k)|i(E)j = 0 f or i < 0, j  Z}. 3. There is an adjunction iSH : SHeff (k)  SH(k) : SH. Moreover, iSH
is right thom-exact, and SH is thom-exact.
4. The functor E  0(E) induces an equivalence of categories HtSH and HI(k), where HI(k) is the category of homotopy modules (see Definition 5.2.4 of [Mor]). Next, the functor E  0(E)0 induces an equivalence HtSHeff = HIfr(k), where HIfr(k) is the category of homotopy invariant stable Nisnevich sheaves with framed transfers (see §1 of [GP] for this definitions).
5. For E  Ht, X  SmVar, and n  Z we have HNn is(X, 0(E)0) = E0n (X ).
10

Proof. 1,2. This has been proved in Theorem 2.3 of [Hoy15]. 3. See Corollary 3.3.7(2) of [BoD17] or Proposition 2.2.5(1) of [Bon20a]. 4. See Theorem 5.2.6 of [Mor] and Theorem 5.14 of [BaY20]. 5. This fact is well-known; see Proposition 5.1.1(8) of [Bon18b].

3 "Smooth" aisles and birationality filtrations
in motivic categories
This section contains the central technical results of the paper. In §3.1 we define certain aisles in terms of motives of smooth varieties and describe them in terms of the stalks corresponding to function fields. Next we prove that thom-homology respect these classes. In §3.2 we introduce the n-birational categories Dn-bir. We use our aisles to study the birationality filtration on Htehfofm, and prove that the homotopy t-structure restricts to Dn-bir  Deff .

3.1 Smoothly generated aisles: definition and main properties

Definition 3.1.1. If s = (sj) is a non-decreasing sequence in Z  {±}, j  Z, then we define an aisle (see Remark 3.1.4 below) As as ({MR(SmVar) j [tj]})D, where we take all tj < sj, tj  Z.
We will also use the following modification of this definition in the effective setting: we take j  0 and take the orthogonal in Deff .

Lemma 3.1.2. 1. We have the following equality: As = {C  D|D(M(K) j [ti], C) = 0} for all function fields K/k, j  Z, and tj < sj (see Definition 2.4.1(4) for the corresponding notation).
2. Similar assertion holds in the effective case if one takes j  0.

Proof. 1. We should prove that As = ({jZMR(K) j [ti]})D. Obviously, the first of these classes is contained in the second one; cf. Definition 2.4.1(4). Conversely, if N belongs to the second class then the convergent coniveau spectral sequence

E1p,q =

Hjq+p-tj (x)  Hjp+q-tj (M(X ))

xX (p)

from (A1) yields that it belongs to As; here Xp is the set of points of X of codimension p, and Hpq(-) are the following cohomology theories (on SmVar): Hpq(X) := D(MR(X) p [-p - q], N ) (see Definition 2.4.1(3)).

11

2. In the effective case the proof is completely similar.

Proposition 3.1.3. The following conditions for an object C  D are equiv-

alent:

1. C  As.

2.

H thom r

(C

)[r]



As

for

all

r



Z.

The obvious effective version of this statement is valid as well.

Proof. By the previous lemma it suffices to prove that D(M(K){j}[ti], C) =

D(M(K

){j

},

H thom ti

(C

))

for

all

function

fields

K/k

and

j



Z.

This

isomor-

phism is well known. By the definition of tDhom (see Proposition 2.5.4(1,2))

and the adjunction from Remark 2.2.3 it suffices to verify it for C  D , thomti

and in the latter case it follows from the well-known Corollary 2.4 of [Hoy15].

In the effective case, the proof is literally the same.

Remark 3.1.4. 1. It is noteworthy that our As are aisles (see §1 of [AJS03] for the definition and discussions on this notion). Indeed, the pair (As, As ) gives a t-structure for each As; see §4.2 below.
2. Note also that the assumption that the sequence s in Definition 3.1.1 is non-decreasing is not restrictive. Indeed, if we take sj = supij si (for the corresponding values of j) then our definition easily implies the equality
As = As. To obtain the non-obvious inclusion here it suffices to recall that M(X) n is a retract of M(PnX) for any X  SmVar.
For this reason, we only consider non-decreasing sequences; this also sim-
plifies some of the formulations (see Propositions 4.2.2 and 4.3.1 below).

3.2 Weakly birational categories in terms of smooth aisles
In this section we apply our results to shift-stable aisles.
· Let n  0. Let us recall some properties of the n-birational motivic category Dn-bir := Deff {n + 1}. Firstly, we have an adjunction pn : Deff  Deff /Deff {n + 1} : i(n); here pn is the corresponding localization, the functor i(n) is fully faithful and induces an equivalence Deff /Deff {n + 1} = Dn-bir, and there exists a right adjoint Rnr,n to it.4 These statements follow from well-known abstract nonsense; see Proposition 3.6 and Theorem 1.4(2) of [Pel13] or Theorem A.2.6 and Lemma 4.5.4 of [KaS17].
4The motivation for our terminology is that the localization functor MRn-bir := pnMR sends all open immersions U  V with codimV (V \ U )  n + 1 into isomorphisms.

12

· Also we recall very briefly the notion of so-called slices; see §1 of [Pel13] and §4.2 of [KaS17] for details. We have an adjunction in : Deff {n}  Deff : rn, which defines a functor n : Deff  Deff as the composi-
tion in  rn. Then we have the following slice filtration triangle for any C  Deff :

n(C)  C  i(n-1)pn-1(C)  n(C)[1]

(3.2.1)

Next we study the properties of objects from the heart of tehfofm with respect to the As-filtration. Recall that objects of Htehfofm for all categories considered in this article are "sheaf-like" (see Propositions 2.5.4(4), 5.1.3(2),
5.1.1(3), 5.1.2(3) for the corresponding descriptions).

Proposition 3.2.1. Assume that r  -1 is fixed, and define a sequence sr-bir as follows: sjr-bir = - for 0  j  r and sjr-bir = + for j  r + 1. Then for S  Obj Htehfofm  Deff the following conditions are equivalent: 1. S  As. 2. The Nisnevich cohomology of S vanishes in degrees > r. 3. S(K{m}) = {0} for all function fields K/k and m > r, where S(K{m}) = Deff (M(K){m}, S). 4. S(K{r + 1}) = {0} for all function fields K/k. 5. S-r-1 = 0 (see Definition 2.4.1(5) for this notation).
Proof. Axiom (A2) along with Proposition 3.1.2 immediately give the equivalence of conditions (1) and (3). Recalling the spectral sequence

E1p,q =

Spq(x)  S0p+q(M(X))

xX (p)

given by (A1) (here Xp is the set of points of X of codimension p). Now we note that Deff (M(X), S[p + q]) = HNp+isq(X, S) (see Proposition 2.5.4(5) and Remark 5.1.5). It easily follows that (3)  (2).
Next, recall that S(K{m}) = -lim D(MD(X)  T m[-m], S). Since X,k(X )=K
D(MD(X)  T m, S) is a retract of D(MD((P1)m(X)), S[m]) (see Remark
2.3.1(2)), we obtain (2)  (3).
Moreover, condition (3) obviously implies (4). Next, if (4) is fulfilled then
S-r-1 = 0 since we can apply Corollary 2.4.2(2) to S-r-1. Lastly, if (5) is valid then S-m = 0 for all m > r; hence S-m(K) = {0} for all function fields K/k by Axiom (A2).

Remark 3.2.2. 1. It is easily seen that Asr-bir = Deff {r + 1}; see Remarks 2.3.2(2,3).

13

The objects of Deff {r + 1} (that also satisfy the equivalent conditions of the proposition above) will be called r-birational. We will also say that they are weakly birational. Note also that our Proposition 3.2.1 generalizes Proposition 2.5.2 of [KaS17] (which follows from it if we put r = 0). 2. Clearly, conditions 1, 2, and 3 of the proposition are equivalent in the ("degenerate") case r = + as well.
Proposition 3.2.3. tehfofm restricts to a (homotopy) t-structure thno-mbir on the category Dn-bir. Respectively, the functor pn is right t-exact, whereas i(n) is t-exact and Rnr,n is left t-exact.
Proof. It suffices to prove that the thom-truncations preserve the class Dn-bir := Deff {n + 1}, and the latter fact follows from Proposition 3.1.3 immediately.
Remark 3.2.4. Our Proposition 3.2.3 widely generalizes Theorem 4.4.1 of [KaS17] (only case of DMeff (k) and n = 0 was considered there). Note also that the arguments used in ibid. cannot be applied for n > 0.
4 Smooth weight and t-structures and their applications
In §4.1 we recall the basics of the theory of weight structures. In §4.2 we give the definition of smooth weight structures wSs mooth and wSefmfo,soth corresponding to certain sequences sj, and prove their main properties. We also express the conditions of weak birationality in terms of our wSefmfo,soth. Next we define a filtration on the Hthom using the adjacent t-structure teSfmfooth, and prove some of its interesting properties. We also apply our results to the study of unramified cohomology. In §4.3 we prove some weak weight-exactness property of the functor - n and so we obtain that wSefmfooth induces a weight structure on the n-birational category Dn-bir (actually, this is also true for wSefmfo,soth under certain assumptions on s = (sj)).
4.1 Weight structures: a short recollection
Let us recall the definitions and some properties of weight structures.
14

Definition 4.1.1. I. A pair of subclasses Cw0, Cw0  Obj C will be said to define a weight structure w for a triangulated category C if they satisfy the following conditions.5
(i) Cw0, Cw0 are retraction-closed in C (i.e., contain all C-retracts of their objects).
(ii) Semi-invariance with respect to translations.
Cw0  Cw0[1], Cw0[1]  Cw0. (iii) Orthogonality.
Cw0  Cw0[1]. (iv) Weight decompositions.
For any M  Obj C there exists a distinguished triangle

X  M  Y X[1]

such that X  Cw0, Y  Cw0[1]. We will also need the following definitions.

Definition 4.1.2. Let i, j  Z; assume that a triangulated category C is endowed with a weight structure w.

1. The full category Hw  C whose object class is Cw=0 = Cw0  Cw0 is called the heart of the weight structure w.

2. Cwi (resp. Cwi, resp. Cw=i) will denote Cw0[i] (resp. Cw0[i], resp. C w=0 [i]).
3. We will say that a weight structure w is generated by a class P  Obj C if Cw0 = (i>0P[-i]).
4. We will call iZCwi the class of w-bounded below objects of C; it will be denoted by C+.
5. We will say that w is smashing if both the category C and the class Cw0 is closed with respect to (small) C-coproducts (cf. Proposition 4.1.4(2)).

6. Let C be a triangulated category endowed with a weight structures w; let F : C  C be an exact functor.

F is said to be weight-exact (with respect to w, w) if it maps Cw0 into

C

 w

0

and

sends

C w0

into

C

 w

0

.

5In the current paper we use the so-called homological convention for weight structures;
whereas in [Bon10a] the cohomological convention was used. In the latter convention the roles of Cw0 and Cw0 are interchanged, i.e., one considers Cw0 = Cw0 and Cw0 = Cw0.

15

7. Let D be a full triangulated subcategory of C.
We will say that w restricts to D whenever the couple (Cw0Obj D, Cw0 Obj D) is a weight structure on D.

Remark 4.1.3. A weight decomposition (of any M  Obj C) is (almost) never canonical.
Still for any m  Z axiom (iv) gives the existence of distinguished triangle

wmM  M  wm+1M

(4.1.1)

with some wm+1M  Cwm+1 and wmM  Cwm; we will call it an mweight decomposition of M.
We will often use this notation below (even though wm+1M and wmM are not canonically determined by M); we will call any possible choice either
of wm+1M or of wmM (for any m  Z) a weight truncation of M . Moreover, when we will write arrows of the type wmM  M or M  wm+1M we will always assume that they come from some m-weight decomposition of M.

Proposition 4.1.4. Let C be a triangulated category, n  0; we will assume that w is a fixed weight structure on C.

1. The axiomatics of weight structures is self-dual, i.e., for D = Cop (so Obj D = Obj C) there exists the (opposite) weight structure w for which Dw0 = Cw0 and Dw0 = Cw0.
2. Cw0 is closed with respect to C-coproducts.
3. Cw0 = (Cw-1) and Cw0 = Cw1. Thus if w is generated by a class P then P  Cw0.
4. Let m  l  Z, X, X  Obj C; fix certain weight decompositions of X[-m] and X[-l]. Then any morphism g : X  X can be extended to a commutative diagram of the corresponding distinguished triangles (see Remark 4.1.3(2)):

wmX

---

X --- g

wm+1X

wlX --- X --- wl+1X

Moreover, if m < l then this extension is unique (provided that the rows are fixed).

16

Proof. See Remark 1.1.2(1), Proposition 1.3.3(1,2,5) and Lemma 1.5.1(1,2) of [Bon10a].
Proposition 4.1.5. Assume that C is a compactly generated category.
1. Let P be a set of compact objects of C. Then there exists (a unique) weight structure on C that is generated by P, and P  Cw0.
2. Assume that an exact functor F : C  C respects coproducts, w is a weight structure on C that is generated by some class P  Obj C, and w is a weight structure on C. Then F is left weight-exact if and only if F (P)  Cw0.
Proof. See Theorem 5 of [Pau12] (cf. also Proposition 1.2.3(II) of [BoK18]).

4.2 Smooth weight and t-structures, unramified cohomology, and the weakly birational filtration

Definition 4.2.1. For any category of the type Deff or D we will write wSefmfo,soth (resp. wSs mooth) for the weight structure defined by As on Deff (resp.
on D); that is, we assume that the class of weight-non-negative objects equals

As. We will write just wSefmfooth and wSmooth in the case where all sj are zero.

Proposition 4.2.2. Assume that S  Obj Htehfofm  Deff . Then the follow-

ing conditions are equivalent:

1.

S

 D . eff wSefmfo,soth0

2. Condition 2 of Proposition 3.2.1 is fulfilled if one takes r to be the minimal

integer m  -1 such that sm+1  -m-1 if m of this sort exists and r = + otherwise (see Remark 3.2.2(2)).

Proof. 1  2. This implication follows from the definition of wSefmfo,soth, Proposition 2.5.4(5) and Remark 5.1.5. 2  1. Condition (2) implies that Deff (M(X), S[i]) = {0} for i > r. This
implies that S belongs to the class As, where we choose the sequence s as in the formulation. Namely, we set sr+1 = -r - 1 if the first of the alternatives in (2) holds, and (sj) = - otherwise (recall that we assume all our sequences to be non-decreasing).

Remark 4.2.3. 1. Clearly, in the case r < + conditions 3­5 of Proposition
3.2.1 are equivalent to our ones as well. 2. Actually, our principal examples are s = sr-bir (see Proposition 3.2.1)
and s = 0 (that corresponds to the smooth weight structure wSefmfooth).

17

Now we define some new t-structures.

Definition 4.2.4. 1. We will say that a t-structure t is right adjacent to w whenever Cw0 = Ct0.
2. If H : C  A is contravariant functor, A is an abelian category, then we define W j(H)(X) := Im(H(wj(X))  H(X)) (see Remark 4.1.3). The map thus defined gives a canonical subfunctor of H (in particular, this image does not depend on the choice of a weight decomposition of X[j]); see Proposition 2.1.2 of [Bon10a].

We will omit the adjective "right" in this definition and simply write "adjacent", since further we will need this case of the definition only. Recall also that Deff satisfies the Brown representability property since it is compactly generated (see Ch. 8 of [Nee01]).

Construction-Definition 4.2.5. 1. Since all the weight structures wSefmfo,soth are smashing (see Definition 4.1.2(5)), there exists a t-structure teSfmfo,soth adjacent to it; see Theorem 3.2.3(I) of [Bon19]. Thus we have a canon-

ical

map

 (E) teSfmfo,soth -j



E

for

any

E



Deff ;

see

Definition

2.2.1(iii)

and Remark 2.2.3(1).

Further,

we

can

apply

H tehfofm 0

to this map, and

get a canonical

morphism

H ( (E) tehfofm 0

teSfmfo,soth -j



E).

As above,

we

will

write just teSfmfooth in the case sj = 0 (for j  0).

2. If we apply the previous construction to E  Obj Htehfofm we get maps

from

H tehfofm



Def f tSmooth -j

to

H tehfofm.

They give rise to the following

filtration:

F j,s(E)

=

Im (H ( (E)) Htehfofm

thom 0

teSfmfo,soth -j



H thom 0

(E

)

=

E).

Now we will study in more detail our filtration for the t-structure, generated by As.

Theorem 4.2.6. Let -1  i  +, j  Z.

1. The category Hti-bir,s of i-birational objects is a Serre abelian subcategory of Htehfofm, and we denote by ji this inclusion. Fix E  Obj Htehfofm.
2. The object F j,s(E) is the maximal r-birational subobject of E in Hthefofm, where we take r to be the minimal m  -1 such that sm+1  -j if m of this sort exists and r = + otherwise (see Remark 3.2.2(2)).
Thus, F j,s is right adjoint to the inclusion jr.

18

3. The higher unramified part functor Rnr,i (see §3.2; cf. also §7.1 of

[KaS17])

gives

the

t-truncation

 . teSfmfo,soit-hbir 0

4.

Similarly,

wef f,si-bir Smooth

-truncations

give

the

corresponding

slices

(see

the

beginning of §3.2).

5. E belongs to HteSfmfooth if and only if it is birational (see Remark 3.2.2(1)).

Proof. 1. Suppose that 0  S  S  S  0 is an exact sequence in Htehfofm. Since the stalks as in condition (4) of Proposition 3.2.1 give exact functors Htehfofm  Ab (see our Corollary 2.4.2(2)), S belongs to Hti-bir,s if and only if S and S do.

2. The sheaf F j,s(E) is r-birational by Propositions 4.2.2 , 3.1.3 and

assertion (1) above. Let E f E be some r-birational subobject of E.

Since

E



D , eff teSfmfo,soth-j

the

adjunction

corresponding

to

 teSfmfo,soth -j

(see

Remark

2.2.3(1))

yields

that

f

factors

through

 (E). teSfmfo,soth -j

Applying H0hom to the

correspondiing commutative triangle we obtain that f also factors through

F j,s(E).

3.

Our

assertion

follows

from

the

adjunctions

Def f teSfmfo,soit-hbir 0

 Deff

and

i(i)  Rnr,i.

4. Note that our weight structure is also a t-structure (by definition).

Thus, our statement is an obvious consequence of the definition of slices and

corresponding adjunctions (cf. assertion (3) above and §3.2).

5.

Obvious;

note

that

Def f thom0



D . eff tSmooth 0

Remark 4.2.7. 1. In particular, for E  Obj Htehfofm we have F j(E) = E if and only if E is j-birational.
2. It would be interesting to relate our filtration with the filtration from Theorem 15 of [Bac18] (in the case Deff = SH(k)eff ).
3. For the weight structure as in assertion (4) above W (Deff (-, R(n)[m]))
gives the filtration from Definition 5.2.1 and Corollary 5.3.3 of [Pel17]. Note that for m = 2n and Deff = DM eff this is a candidate for a Bloch-Beilinson-
Murre filtration (see Theorem 6.1.4, Conjecture 6.1.7, Proposition 6.1.8 and
Rem. 6.1.9 of ibid.).

Next we apply our results to the study of unramified cohomology.

Corollary 4.2.8. 1. If S  Obj Htehfofm then the Htehfofm-monomorphism c(S) : F 0(S)  S from Construction-Definition 4.2.5 gives the unramified part of DeRff (-, S) in the sense of [KaS17, Definition 7.2.1].

19

2. Let M  HwSmootheRff and for some X  SmVar and f : MR(X)  M assume that p0(f ) is an isomorphism. Then DeRff (f, S) is monomorphic, and its image yields the unramified part of DeRff (MR(X), S).
Proof. 1. See Proposition 2.6.3 and Theorem 7.3.1 of [KaS17], and [Aso, Lemma 4.2] (note that the proofs given there are applicable to any of the motivic categories from §2.3)
2. We argue similarly to [Bon20b, Theorem 2.2.3]. Consider the following commutative diagram

DeRff (M, F 0(S))

=

DeRff (MR(X), F 0(S))

c(S)

DeRff (M, S)

DeRff (MR(X), S)

Firstly, by adjunctions and Theorem 4.2.6 we have DeRff (M, i(0)Rnr,0(S)) = DeRff (M, F 0(S)). Now, let us

DeRff (i(0)p0(M ), S) = look at the following

exact sequence coming from the slice filtration triangle (3.2.1):

0  DeRff (M, F 0(S))  DeRff (M, S)  DeRff (1(M ), S)

It remains to prove that the map c(S) is epimorphic. This fact follows from

the sequence above along with the orthogonality axiom for t-structures,

since

1(M

)



Def f thom 1

(see

Lemma

2.2.4(2)

of

[BoK18]

Proposition 4.2.9. 1. Let E, X  Deff . Then W i(Deff (-, E))(X) =

Im(Def f

Deff (X,

E)).

2. For all i, j and X, Y  Deff we have a functorial isomorphism

Def f (X, teS-fmfio,soth (Y )[j + i]) = Im(Def f (wSefmfo,sothj(X), Y [i])  Def f (wSefmfo,sothj-1(X), Y [i + 1])).

5. If C  Dthomi, U  SmVar, i  0 then

D(M(U ),

(C

=

D(wSmooth-iM(U ),

C ).

20

Proof. 1, 2. See Theorem 4.4.2(6,7) of [Bon10a].

3. See Theorem 2.6.1(4) of [Bon10b].

4. Obviously, the first of these classes is contained in the second one.

Let X be an object of D+. To check the inverse inclusion, it suffices to

prove that X  Y for X  ( D ), i<0 tSmooth=i and for all Y  D . tSmooth-1

Since

X

is

wSmooth-bounded

below,

we

have

X



 (Y tSmooth i

)

for

some

i.

Thus, considering appropriate t-decompositions for Y and its truncations,

we obtain the statement in question.

5. Take the weight decompositions as in Proposition 4.1.4(4) for m = -i-

2, l = -i - 1, g = idM(U). Applying the functor D(-, C) one can check that the map D(wSmooth-iM(U ), C)  D(wSmooth-i-1M(U ), C) is injective. Now the claim follows from Theorem 4.4.2(7) of [Bon10a] immediately.

4.3 More on n-birational categories and weight-exact localisations

In this section we prove some weak weight-exactness properties of the functor - n . As a consequence, we get the wSefmfooth and wSmooth-exactness of this
functor, as well as of the localization functor pn. Note that in this paragraph, we exclude the case of SHS1(k) (cf. Remark 2.3.2(3,4)).

Proposition 4.3.1. Assume that k, n  0 are fixed and sj+n - sj  k for

j

 0;

take

C

 Deff wSefmfo,soth0

for

s = (sj).

Then

C

n

 D . eff wSefmfo,soth-k

Proof.

Let C



D , eff wSefmfo,soth0

and

consider

the

following

functors

from

the

cate-

gory SmVar of smooth k-varieties: Hpq(X) := Deff (M(X){p}[-q], C n [-k])

for each p  0, q  Z, X  SmVar. We should verify that Hjp+q(X) = {0}

for all q > 0, X  SmVar. Let us write the coniveau spectral sequence as in

(A1):

E1p,q =

Hjq+p(x)  Hjp+q(M(X)).

xX (p)

Then E10,q = {0} for q  0 by (A2). Further, for a function field K/k and p > 0 it is easily seen that Hpq+j(K) = Deff (M(K) j + p - n [k - j - p - q], C) = {0} (see Definition 2.4.1(4) for this notation; cf. also the proof of Proposition 3.1.2). It obviously follows that Hjp+q(X) = {0} if p + q > 0,
and that is what we need.

Remark 4.3.2. Clearly, a similar property holds in the non-effective case (cf. Definition 3.1.1).
21

Corollary 4.3.3. 1. The endofunctors - n are wSefmfooth-exact (resp. wSmooth-exact)

for n  0 (resp. n  Z).

2. The embedding i : Deff  D is weight-exact with respect to wSefmfooth

and wSmooth.

3. Take a sequence (sj)j0 such that sj+n - sj  1 for all j  0. Then the

functor pn is weight-exact with respect to the weight structures wSefmfo,soth and wn-bir,s, where the weight structure wn-bir,s is defined via MRn-bir similarly

to Definitions 4.2.1 and 3.1.1.

4. D  D . eff wSefmfooth0

ef f tehfofm 0

Proof. 1. Take sj = 0 for j  0 (resp. j  Z) in the previous proposition.

2. From Proposition 4.1.5(2) we obtain that i is left weight-exact. To

prove

the

right

weight-exactness,

we

take

C



D , eff wSefmfooth0

and

consider

the

group D(MR(X) n [s], C), where X  SmVar, n  Z, s < 0. Then in the

case of n  0 this group vanishes by the previous assertion. If n < 0, then

D(MR(X) n [s], C) = Deff (MR(X)[s], C -n ), and C -n

 D , eff wSefmfooth0

and this group vanishes also. Thus, we are done.

3. Take a weight decomposition X  C  Y  X[1] with respect to

wSefmfo,soth, and twist it by - n ; then we have Y

n

 D  D eff

ef f

wSefmfo,soth0

n

by

Proposition 4.3.1, and X n

 D  D n eff

ef f

by definition. Thus our

statement follows from Theorem 3.1.3(2) of [BoS19].

4. Immediately from definition and Proposition 2.5.4(1) (see also Lemma

2.2.4(3) of [BoK18]).

5 Our constructions in motivic categories distinct from SH
For the convenience of the reader, now we discuss our main constructions and results in the case where D is distinct from SH. As noted earlier, these results are quite similar to those obtained in Proposition 2.5.4.
5.1 Our notions and assumptions in various motivic categories
In this section, we check our axioms and discuss the related definitions for the motivic categories distinct from SHeff (k)  SH(k).
Firstly, recall that there exists a canonical exact monoidal connecting functorfrom SHS1(k) into each our motivic category D(k); it send MSHS1 (X)
22

into the corresponding MD(X). This gives the isomorphism MD(P1) =
½D  T mentioned in the beginning of §2.3. Thus the spectral sequences of
axiom (A1) in all of these D(k) can be obtained from the one for SHS1(k).
Now let us check axiom (A2) for each of our categories separately; cf.
Lemma 2.5.2 above.

The case of SHS1(k)

We will write nA1(E) for the Nisnevich sheaf associated to the presheaf X  E0-n(X) = SHS1(M(X+)[n], E), X  SmVar, n  Z.
Proposition 5.1.1. 1. E  SHS1(k)0 if and only if nA1(E) = 0 for n < 0.

2. E  SHS1(k)0 if and only if nA1(E) = 0 for n > 0.

Easy from the corresponding result for SH(k), thom-exactness and conservativity of the "forgetful" functor O, which is right adjoint to the natural connecting functor L : SH(k)  MGl - Mod(k) (for which L(MSH(X){i}[n]) = MGl(X){i}[n]); see Example 2.3.3 of [BoD17] and §2.2.5 of [Deg13].

Remark 5.1.5. Recall also that for each of the categories Deff (k) there is a "forgetful" tehfofm-exact functor D to SHS1(k), which is right adjoint to the natural functor SHS1(k)  Deff (easily follows from our description of tehfofm in terms of homotopy sheaves, see also Lemma 6.2 (2) of [BaY20]).

5.2 On localizations of coefficients in motivic categories
Now we recall some basics on localizations of coefficient rings (actually, we "start from" the case where the coefficient ring is just Z) in compactly generated triangulated categories.
Below S  Z will be a set of prime numbers; denote the ring Z[S-1] by R.

24

Proposition 5.2.1. Assume that C is compactly generated by a small subcategory C. Denote by CS-tors the localizing subcategory of C (compactly) generated by Cone(c -×s c) for c  Obj C, s  S. Then the following statements are valid.
1. CS-tors contains the cones of c -×s c for all c  Obj C, s  S.
2. The Verdier quotient CR = C/CS-tors exists (i.e., morphisms form sets); the localization functor l : C  CR respects coproducts and converts compact objects into compact ones. Moreover, CR is generated by l(Obj C) as a localizing subcategory.
3. For any c  Obj C, c  Obj C, we have CR(l(c), l(c)) = C(c, c) Z R.
4. l possesses a right adjoint G that is a full embedding functor. The essential image of G consists of those M  Obj C, such that sIdM is an automorphism for any s  S.
5. Assume char(k) = p, and p  S if p > 0. Then the category DcR(k) is rigid. Moreover, DcR(k) is the smallest thick subcategory of DR(k) containing all MR(P ){i} for P  SmPrVar, i  Z. Thus, the set MR(SmPrVar) compactly generates DR(k).
Surely, the corresponding statements are fulfilled for the effective case.
Proof. 1, 2, 3, 4. See Proposition 1.2.5 of [Bon20a]. 5. See [Bon20a, Proposition 2.2.3(9)] (cf. also Corollary 2.4.8 of [BoD17]
and [Bon11, Lemma 2.3.1]).
Remark 5.2.2. 1. Since ChowR is Karoubian and connective in DMR (i.e., ChowR  ChowR[i] for all i > 0; see Remark 3.1.2 of [BoK18]), Corollary 2.1.2 of [BoS18b] gives a unique weight structure wChow,gm on the smallest full retraction-closed triangulated subcategory of DMR containing ChowR such that HwChow,gm = ChowR. An important observation is that if char(k) = 0 or char(k) = p  S, then wSefmfooth and wSmooth is also generated by the motives of smooth projective varieties (see Theorem 2.1.2(2) of [BoK18] and the proposition above). Moreover, in these cases DMR(k) and MGl - ModR(k) differ from other motivic categories in that we can describe the hearts of wSmooth "geometrically"; these are just the corresponding "big" categories of Chow motives. Respectively, in this case Proposition 4.2.8(2) gives a quite explicit calculation of unramified cohomology. Moreover,
25

in these case wSefmfooth and wSmooth restrict to the corresponding subcategories DMgemff,R(k)  DMgm,R(k) of compact objects (which equal the smallest strict triangulated subcategories of DMReff (k)  DMR(k) that contain the corresponding Chow motives), and HwChow,gm is equivalent to the corresponding additive category of Chow motives ChowR. These types of Chow weight structures originate from §6.5 of [Bon10a] and [Bon11] (cf. also Remark 3.1.4 and Proposition 3.2.6 of [Bon21]).
Note also that one of the obstructions for inclusion ChowR  HwChow is the non-triviality of the Hopf map  (see §6.2 of [Mor]). It is closely related to orientability, cf. [BKWX20].
2. Take S = {2}, and recall the decomposition SH(k)[1/2] = SH(k)+ × SH(k)- (induced by the symmetry involution of P1  P1; see §6 of [Lev]). It easily follows that we can also add SH(k)+ to the examples listed in §5.1.
3. Summarizing the above, we obtain that all the results of the previous sections can be applied directly to every motivic category mentioned in §2.3.
5.3 Supplementary remarks and questions
Possibly the matters mentioned below will be studied in consequent papers.
Remark 5.3.1. 1. It would be interesting to generalize our weight and tstructure definitions and results to relative motives over general base schemes. We also plan to study the weight-exactness for various functors between motivic categories.
2. In [BKWX20] a t-structure generated by objects of the form T hX(), where X  SmP roj/k and   K(X) was considered. Probably, this t-structure is dual (in some sense) to our teSfmfooth.
3. In the papers [BoS14] and [BoK20] certain Chow-weight homology functors from the categories DMgemff (k) and DM eff (k) were studied in detail. Using the results of this article (especially §4.3), one can generalize this theory to any motivic category. The most interesting case is SH(S) (for a "reasonable" base scheme S).
4. For which objects S  Htehfofm is our filtration finite (i.e., there exists N with F N (S) = S)? Is it exhaustive?
