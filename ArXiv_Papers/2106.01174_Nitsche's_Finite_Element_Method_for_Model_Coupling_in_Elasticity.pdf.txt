Abstract We develop a Nitsche finite element method for a model of Euler­ Bernoulli beams with axial stiffness embedded in a two­dimensional elastic bulk domain. The beams have their own displacement fields, and the elastic subdomains created by the beam network are triangulated independently and are coupled to the beams weakly by use of Nitsche's method in the framework of hybridization.
1 Introduction
In this paper we continue our work on coupling of elastic models[1, 2, 3, 4]. Unlike previous coupling models [3, 5], we take as our starting point the hybridized approach of Burman et al.[6], where an auxiliary interface variable is introduced in the Nitsche framework. The hybridized formulation conveniently supports solution and preconditioning based on substructuring where the bulk variables are eliminated resulting in a system for the hybrid variable. Furthermore, the hybrid variable may be used to model interfaces with mechanical properties such as bending and membrane stiffness. We consider in particular embedded interfaces made up by beams-trusses embedded in a two dimensional elastic membrane with both strong and cohesive coupling between the beamtruss interface and the membrane. Using the hybridized Nitsche framework we easily derive a weak formulation, which directly leads to a finite element method by replacing the function spaces with conforming finite dimensional finite element spaces. The cohesive formulation is designed in such a way that we may let the stiffness in the coupling tend to infinity without loss of stability or convergence. We focus our attention on fitted meshes, that are not required to match on the interface, but the approach can directly be extended to cut finite element formulations.
The outline of the paper is as follows: In Section 2 we introduce the hybridized formulation for an elastic interface problem, in Section 3 we consider
1

interfaces with bending and membrane stiffness as well as strong and cohesive coupling to the elastic problem. In Section 4 we present some numerical examples illustrating the method and we observe optimal order convergence properties.

2 The Elastic Interface Problem

We begin by extending the hybridized Nitsche method proposed by Burman
et al. [6] to the case of linearized elasticity. Let  denote a bounded domain in R2. For ease of presentation, we consider only the case where  is divided into two non-overlapping subdomains 1 and 2, 1  2, with interface  = 1  2; the case of several domains is a straightforward extension. We further assume that the subdomains are polygonal so that  is piecewise linear. In
each subdomain, we assume plane stress linearized elasticity with homogeneous
Dirichlet boundary conditions, i.e., we seek displacement fields (u1, u2, u) that are zero on . The problem takes the form: find ui : i  R2 and u :   R2 such that

(ui) = 2µ(ui) +   · uiI -(ui) ·  = f i
(u) · n = 0 ui - u = 0
Here we used the notation

in i in i on  on   i

(2.1) (2.2) (2.3) (2.4)

(v) · n := (v1) · n1 + (v2) · n2

(2.5)

where ni denotes the outward pointing normal to i, (u) is the stress tensor,  (u) = [ij(u)]2i,j=1 is the strain tensor with components

1 ij(u) = 2

ui + uj xj xi

(2.6)

I = [ij]2i,j=1 with ij = 1 if i = j and ij = 0 if i = j, and  and µ are the Lam´e parameters in plane stress, so in terms of Young's modulus, E, and Poisson's

ratio, , we have

E

E

 = 1 - 2 ,

µ=

.

2 (1 + )

(2.7)

Now, multiplying (2.2) by test functions vi, vi = 0 on  \ , integrating

2

by parts over i, and using (2.4) we find

(f i, vi)i = (-(ui) · , vi)i

i

i

= ((ui), (vi))i - ((ui) · ni, vi)i

i

i

= ((ui), (vi))i - ((ui) · ni, vi)

i

i

- (ui - u, (vi) · ni) + (i(ui - u, vi - v)
i

(2.8) (2.9) (2.10) (2.11)

where i  R+ are arbitrary. Using the interface condition (2.3), in the form ( (u) · n , u) = 0, we finally obtain

(f i, vi)i = ((ui), (vi))i - ((ui) · ni, vi - v)

i

i

i

- (ui - u, (vi) · ni) + (i(ui - u, vi - v)
i

(2.12) (2.13)

To formulate a finite element method we let Vih, i = 1, 2, and Vh be conforming finite element spaces, such that uhi  Vih and uh  Vh. We then obtain the hybridized Nitsche method from Burman et al.[6], extended to linear elasticity: find (uh1 , uh2 , uh)  V1h  V2h  Vh such that

(f i, vi)i = ((uhi ), (vi))i - ((uhi ) · ni, vi - v)

i

i

i

- (uhi - uh, (vi) · ni)
i

+ (i(uhi - uh), vi - v)
i

(2.14) (2.15) (2.16)

for all (v1, v2, v)  V1h  V2h  Vh.

Remark 2.1 With local meshsize hi on i and the choice

i = 0,ih-i 1

(2.17)

it is possible to show that the bilinear form is coercive on the finite element space, provided the parameters 0,i are taken large enough, which together with Galerkin orthogonality and approximation properties of the finite element spaces leads to optimal order a priori error estimates. We refer to Burman et al.[6] for details.

3 Interfaces with Bending and Membrane Stiffness

3.1 Strong Coupling

We now add bending and membrane stiffness of the interface to our functional

in the vein of model coupling in creeping flow [7]. We assume that we are given

and arclength parameter s and a unit tangent vector t along , which creates an

orthonormal system with the unit normal n to . For definiteness we assume

that n = n1 = -n2, and t = t1 = -t2. We further split u into a normal and a tangential part

u = unn + utt

(3.1)

with ut = t · u and un = n · u. The equilibrium equations on  are then assumed as follows

d2 ds2

EI

d2un ds2

= fn - n ·  · n

(3.2)

and

d -
ds

EA dut ds

= ft - t ·  · n

(3.3)

where fn and ft are given external loads. Here EI denotes bending stiffness (with I the second moment of inertia) and EA axial stiffness (with A the cross section area), both possibly varying with position. These two equilibrium equations now replace the interface equilibrium (2.3) which no longer holds.
Again, multiplying (2.2) by test functions vi, vi = 0 on  \ , integrating by parts over i, and using (2.4) we find

(f i, vi)i = -((ui) · , vi)i

i

i

= ((ui), (vi))i - ((ui) · ni, vi)i

i

i

= ((ui), (vi))i - ((ui) · ni, vi)

i

i

- (ui - u, (vi) · ni) + (i(ui - u), vi)
i

Writing v = vnn + vtt we see that

(3.4) (3.5) (3.6) (3.7)

((ui) · ni, v) = (  · n , v)

i

= (t ·  · n , vt) + (n ·  · n , vn)

EA dut ds

, vt

d2 fn - ds2

EI

d2un ds2

, vn


(3.8) (3.9) (3.10) (3.11)

Our Nitsche method thus takes the form: find (uh1 , uh2 , uhn, uht )  V1h  V2h  Vnh  Vth such that

((uhi ), (vi))i - ((uhi ) · ni, vi - vnn - vtt)

i

i

- (uhi - uhnn - uht t, (vi) · ni)

d2vn ds2



= (f , vi)i + (ft, vt) + (fn, vn)
i

(3.12) (3.13) (3.14) (3.15) (3.16)

for all (v1, v2, vn, vt)  V1h  V2h  Vnh  Vth.

· In this setting, Vnh must be a space of C1()-continuous polynomials, whereas Vth can be C0()-continuous. Thus it is reasonable to choose different discretizations for uht and uhn.
· For an interface that have a corner or bifurcates in a points we can not use (uhn, uht ) as global degrees of freedom since these are not continuous if the segments meet at an angle. Thus we must transform the variables back to Cartesian coordinates. We give details for our chosen discretization below.

For brevity let us define

A(u, v) :=

((ui), (vi))i +
i

EA dut , dvt ds ds

+


EI

d2un ds2

,

d2vn ds2

(3.17)


L(v) := (f , vi)i + (ft, vt) + (fn, vn)
i

(3.18)

The finite element method takes the form: find uh := (uh1 , uh2 , uhn, uht )  V h := V1h  V2h  Vnh  Vth such that

L(v) = A(uh, v) - ((uhi ) · ni, vi - v)
i
- (uhi - uh, (vi) · ni)
i
+ (i(uhi - uh), vi - v), v  V h
i

(3.19) (3.20) (3.21)

where we recall that

uh = uhnn + uht t,

v = vnn + vtt

(3.22)

3.2 Cohesive Coupling

To model a weaker coupling we proceed in the spirit of Juntunen and Stenberg [8] and Hansbo and Hansbo [9]. The cohesive model, replacing the strong condition ui = u on , is given by

(ui) · ni + Si(ui - u) = 0 on i  

(3.23)

where Si are coupling stiffness matrices, assumed to be of the form

1

1

Si

=

n i

n+

t i

t

(3.24)

where 1/i and 1/i are stiffness parameters normal and tangential to the interface, respectively. We are interested in the case where i and i can be arbitrarily small, so we write (3.23) as

Ci(ui) · ni + ui - u = 0

where

Ci

=

S

-1 i

=

in  n + it  t.

We

then

find

(3.25)

L(v) = A(u, v) - ((ui) · ni, vi - v)
i
= A(u, v) + ((ui) · ni, Ci(vi) · ni)
i
- ((ui) · ni, Ci(vi) · ni + vi - v)
i
= A(u, v) + ((ui) · ni, Ci(vi) · ni)
i
- ((ui) · ni, Ci(vi) · ni + vi - v)
i
- (Ci(ui) · ni + ui - u, (vi) · ni)
i
+ (Ci(ui) · ni + ui - u,  i(Ci(ui) · ni + ui - u))
i

(3.26) (3.27) (3.28) (3.29) (3.30) (3.31) (3.32)

where the last two terms are zero due to the interface condition and the resulting form on the right hand side is symmetric. Furthermore,  i is a stabilization matrix of the form

 i = ni n  n + tit  t,

ni

=

1 hi/0,i

, + i

ti

=

1 hi/0,i

+ i

(3.33)

where 0,i is sufficiently large (cf. Remark 2.1).

3.3 One-Sided Cohesive Coupling
It is clear that the cohesive model is unphysical in that the beams are allowed to penetrate the domains. Thus we need to enforce strong continuity of contact

6

type in such situations. We then enforce the contact constraints by way of ni · (ui - unn)  0. With n := n ·  · n, t := t ·  · n, vni := ni · (vi - vnn), and vti := ti · (vi - vtt) our contact conditions on  can then be formulated, following Burman and Hansbo[10]:

it(ui) + uit = 0 on i   uin  0 on i  ,
n(ui) + i-1 uin  0 on i   (n(ui) + i-1 uin ) uin = 0 on i  

(3.34) (3.35) (3.36) (3.37)

where we recognise (3.35)­(3.37) as the Kuhn­Tucker conditions. We begin by rewriting (3.32) in normal and tangential components, writing :

L(v) = A(u, v) + (it(ui), t(vi))
i
- (t(ui), it(vi) + vti )
i
- (it(ui) + uit , t(vi))
i
+ (it(vi) + vti , ti(it(ui) + uit ))
i
- (n(ui), vni )
i

(3.38) (3.39) (3.40) (3.41) (3.42)

where we did not introduce the normal component of the cohesive law. We now turn to the alternative formulation of the Kuhn­Tucker conditions
due to Rockafellar [11], introduced in a Nitsche formulation for contact analysis by Chouly and Hild [12]. We recognize that

pi := n(ui) + i-1 uin

(3.43)

act as multipliers (cf. Burman and Hansbo[10], Section 5.1), and the Kuhn­ Tucker conditions are then equivalent to the relation

pi = - 1 [ uin - ipi]+
i

(3.44)

where [x]+ = max(x, 0) and i > 0 but arbitrary. We then write

(n(ui), vni ) = (n(ui) + i-1 uin , vni ) - (i-1 uin , vni ) = (n(ui) + i-1 uin , vni - i(n(vi) + i-1 vni )) + ( i(n(ui) + i-1 uin ), n(vi) + i-1 vni ) - (i-1 uin , vni )

(3.45) (3.46) (3.47) (3.48)

7

Thus we have that

- (n(ui), vni ) = (i-1 uin , vni )

+

-1 i

uin - i(n(ui) + i-1 uin ) + , vni - i(n(vi) + i-1 vni ) 

- ( i(n(ui) + i-1 uin ), n(vi) + i-1 vni )

To obtain well conditioned systems for small i, we examine the case when pi = 0 and pi = 0.

· If pi = 0 we are in contact and

-(n(ui),

vni

) =

- (i-1

uin ,

vni

)

+(

-1 i

uin ,

vni

)

- n(ui), vni  - ( uin , n(vi))

which, with

-1 i

=

0,i/hi

+

i-1

gives

a

scheme

of

the

type

(2.16).

· If pi = 0 we have the cohesive law and

-(n(ui), vni ) = (i-1 uin , vni ) - ( i(n(ui) + i-1 uin , n(vi) + i-1 vni )
= - (in(ui) + uin , n(vi)) - (n(ui), in(vi) + vni ) + (in(ui), n(vi)) + ((i - i)(n(ui) + i-1 uin ), n(vi) + i-1 vni )

and using again

-1 i

=

0,i/hi

+ i-1

we

find

the

standard

method

for

cohesive laws with penalty parameter (i - i)/i2 = 1/(hi/0,i +i) = ni .

Thus the parameter i does not change in contact and out of contact and the schemes become insensitive to small i.

4 Numerical examples
In this Section we illustrate the properties of the model and method by presenting some basic numerical examples. In all cases we used Young's modulus E = 106 and Poisson's ratio  = 1/3 in the bulk, and 0,i = 20( + µ) as a Nitsche penalty parameter.
We consider a macro domain  =# (0», 2#) ×» (0#, 1») sp# li»t in#to»5 subd#om»ains 1 to 5 separated by 6 linesegments AB, BC, BD, CE, DE, and EF, where A = (0, 1/2), B = (1 - 1/ 2, 1/2), C = (1, 1), D = (1, 0), E = (1 + 1/ 2, 1/2), F = (2, 1/2), see Fig. 1.
We use one cubic C1 polynomial in each segment for the approximation of the interface normal displacement un, and one linear polynomial in each segment for the tangential displacement ut. Continuity at the endpoints of the segments

8

is achieved by a transformation to Cartesian coordinates of the nodal variables

by use of

 ux   nx tx 0   un   uy  =  ny ty 0   ut 

(4.1)



0 01



where  := un(s) is the "rotation" degree of freedom in the C1 approximation. The boundary conditions are: Dirichlet boundary conditions (ux, uy) = (0, 0)
at x = 0 and zero Neumann conditions elsewhere. These are also imposed on the
interface variables. We further impose zero rotation for the interface variable un at x = 0 in the case EI > 0. The approximation in the domains is a P 1­C0 approximation (constant strain triangle). In the case of cohesion, we use the
same constants i =:  and i =:  for all interfaces.

4.1 Bending of a Cantilever Structure
We consider constant loads f i = (0, -2 × 104), i = 1, . . . , 5, and show the computational results for the standard hybrid method (EI = EA =  =  = 0) in Fig. 2. We next show the effect of increasing bending stiffness on the interface, with EI = 104 and EI = 105 in Fig. 3. The stiffening effect is noticeable.
Finally, in Fig. 4 we show the effect of normal compliance at a fixed bending stiffness EI = 104. We show the results for  = 10-6 and  = 10-5. The contact algorithm is invoked to avoid domain penetrations.

4.2 Stretching
The loads in this example are f i = (105, 0), i = 1, . . . , 5, to give a stretch of the domain. In Fig. 5 we show the result for the standard hybridized method. We next show the effect of adding membrane and bending stiffness on the interface, with EA = 106 and EI = 0 and with EA = 106, EI = 104 in Fig. 6. We then compare the effect of tangential cohesion,  = 10-5, with that of normal cohesion,  = 10-5, in Fig. 7. Finally, in Fig. 8 we show the effect of having both tangential and normal cohesion.

5 Concluding Remarks
We have introduced a hybridized Nitsche method for linearized elasticity which uses an auxiliary interface displacement, modelled independently of the domains. This allows for easy modeling of different stiffness models at the interface. We have focused here on Euler­Bernoulli beam bending and membrane stiffness, but other models can be easily accommodated; the only requirement is that continuity of displacements between the interface field and the domain fields can be represented. We have also suggested weaker couplings between the interface and domains in the form of a cohesive interface law, with no-penetration fulfilled. This leads to a nonlinear contact problem which fits straighforwardly in the general framework of Nitsche's method. Some numerical examples are provided

9

to show how different parameter choices affect the solution in bending and in stretching of a plane elasticity problem.
