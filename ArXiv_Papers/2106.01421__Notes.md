## Abstract

A/B tests have been widely adopted across industries as the golden rule that guides decision making. However, the long-term true north metrics we ultimately want to drive through A/B test may take a long time to mature. In these situations, a surrogate metric which predicts the long-term metric is often used instead to conclude whether the treatment is effective. However, because the surrogate rarely predicts the true north perfectly, a regular A/B test based on surrogate metrics tends to have high false positive rate and the treatment variant deemed favorable from the test may not be the winning one. In this paper, we discuss how to adjust the A/B testing comparison to ensure experiment results are trustworthy. We also provide practical guidelines on the choice of good surrogate metrics. To provide a concrete example of how to leverage surrogate metrics for fast decision making, we present a case study on developing and evaluating the predicted confirmed hire surrogate metric in LinkedIn job marketplace.
