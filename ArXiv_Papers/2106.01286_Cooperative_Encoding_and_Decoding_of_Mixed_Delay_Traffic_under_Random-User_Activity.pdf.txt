Abstract--This paper analyses the multiplexing gain (MG) achievable over Wyner's symmetric network with random user activity and random arrival of mixed-delay traffic. The mixeddelay traffic is composed of delay-tolerant traffic and delaysensitive traffic where only the former can benefit from transmitter and receiver cooperation since the latter is subject to stringent decoding delays. The total number of cooperation rounds at transmitter and receiver sides is limited to D rounds. We derive inner and outer bounds on the MG region. In the limit as D  , the bounds coincide and the results show that transmitting delaysensitive messages does not cause any penalty on the sum MG. For finite D our bounds are still close and prove that the penalty caused by delay-sensitive transmissions is small.

I. INTRODUCTION

which grows linearly in the MG of "fast" messages, applies to any type scheduling algorithm.

Modern wireless networks have to accommodate a heterogeneous traffic composed of delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant data. For example, communication for remote surgery or other realtime control applications have much more stringent delay constraints than communication of standard data. Coding schemes for such mixed delay traffic are thus of interest to the designers of new generations of wireless networks, notably [1]­[7]. This paper focuses on the mixed-delay multiplexing gain (MG) region of Wyner's symmetric network with randomly activated transmitters (Txs) and receivers (Rxs). The user activity assumption is motivated by random appearance of control or sensor data or mobility of users. In our model, Txs and Rxs are allowed to cooperate but only delay-tolerant transmissions can benefit from such cooperation as the cooperation would violate the stringent delay constraints on delay-sensitive transmissions. Inherent in this model is the assumption that the cooperation delay dominates the delay introduced by channel coding. Throughout this paper, we call delay-tolerant messages "slow" messages and delay-sensitive messages "fast" messages.
Networks with randomly activated users have been studied previously in [8]­[11]. Specifically, in our previous work [11], we analyzed the MG regions of different interference networks with random user activity and random arrivals of mixed-delay traffic, assuming that only neighbouring receivers can cooperate, but not neighbouring Txs as in this work. Cooperation is assumed to take place over dedicated links and during an unlimited number of rounds. Again, only "slow" transmissions can benefit from cooperation. The obtained MG regions in [11] showed that transmitting "fast" messages causes a significant penalty on the sum MG. Notice that an even larger penalty,

In this paper, we show that this penalty on the sum MG caused by the transmission of "fast" messages can be mitigated entirely when not only Rxs but also Txs can cooperate over an unlimited number of rounds. When the number of cooperation rounds is limited to a maximum number of D rounds, a small penalty remains, which is however much smaller than when only Rxs can cooperate. Our results in this paper thus show that a joint coding of the two types of messages yields significant benefits in sum-MG as compared to the simpler scheduling algorithms. To prove the desired results, we present an information-theoretic converse and propose two coding schemes. In our first scheme, we schedule "fast" transmissions so that they do not interfere each other. Each "fast" transmission is thus only interfered by "slow" transmissions, and this interference can be described to the "fast" Txs during the first Tx-cooperation round. This allows the "fast" Txs to precancel the interference and achieve full MG on each "fast" Tx. At the receiver side, "fast" Rxs immediately decode their "fast" messages and send them during the first Rx-cooperation round to their neighbours, which mitigate the interference before decoding their "slow" messages. As a result, "fast" messages can be decoded based on interference-free outputs and moreover, they do not disturb the transmission of "slow" messages. The transmission of "slow" messages can benefit from the remaining D-2 cooperation rounds, e.g., by applying Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) reception in small subnets to jointly decode the "slow" messages at various receivers. Our second scheme only sends "slow" messages. A similar scheme can be used as before, where "fast" messages can simply be replaced by "slow" messages. We obtain an inner bound on the optimal MG region through time-sharing the two schemes.

II. PROBLEM SETUP
Consider Wyner's symmetric network with K transmitters (Tx) and K receivers (Rx) that are aligned on two parallel lines so that each Tx k has two neighbours, Tx k - 1 and Tx k + 1, and each Rx k has two neighbours, Rx k - 1 and Rx k + 1. Define K {1, . . . , K}. The signal transmitted by Tx k  K is observed by Rx k and the neighboring Rxs k - 1 and k + 1. See Figure 1. Each Tx k  K is active with probability   [0, 1], in which case it sends a so called "slow" message Mk(S) to its corresponding Rx k. Here, Mk(S) is uniformly distributed over M(kS) {1, . . . , 2nR(kS)}, with n denoting the blocklength and Rk(S) the rate of message Mk(S). Given that Tx k is active, with probability f  [0, 1], it also sends an additional "fast" message Mk(F ) to Rx k. These "fast" messages are subject to stringent delay constraints, as
we describe shortly, and uniformly distributed over the set M(F ) {1, . . . , 2nR(F) }. "Fast" messages are thus all of same rate R(F ). 1
Let Ak = 1 if Tx k is active and Ak = 0 if Tx k is not active. Moreover, if Tx k is active and has a "fast" message to send, set Bk = 1 and if it is active but has only a "slow" message to send, set Bk = 0. The random tuple A := (A1, . . . , AK ) is thus independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli-, and if they exist the random variables B1, . . . , BK are i.i.d Bernoulli-f . Denote by B the tuple of Bk's that are defined. Further, define the active set and the "fast" set as:

Kactive {k  K : Ak = 1},

(1)

Kfast {k  K : Ak = 1 and Bk = 1}.

(2)

We describe the encoding at the active Txs. The encoding
starts with a first Tx-cooperation phase which consists of DTx > 0 rounds and depends only on the "slow" messages in the system. The "fast" messages, which are subject to
stringent delay constraints, are only generated afterwards, at the beginning of the subsequent channel transmission phase.
So, during the first Tx-cooperation phase, neighbouring active
Txs communicate to each other over dedicated noise-free links of unlimited capacity over DTx > 0 rounds. In each cooperation round j  {1, . . . , DTx}, any active Tx k  Kactive sends a cooperation message to its active neighbours   Nactive,k := {k - 1, k + 1}  Kactive, where the cooperation message can depend on the Tx's "slow" message and the cooperation-information it received during previous rounds. So, in round j, Tx k sends a message

Tk( j)  = k(j)  Mk(S), T(1) k, . . . , T(j-k1) , A, B Nactive,k (3)

1In our model each Tx that has a "fast" message to send also has a "slow" message to send. This model is appropriate for systems where "slow" messages have large volumes and can be delayed over several blocklengths so that most active Txs have "slow" data to send. The study of a setup where an active Tx might exclusively have "fast" messages to send is left for future work. See for example [11] for a related work.

to each Tx   Nactive,k, for some functions k(j)  on appropriate domains. At the beginning of the subsequent

channel-coding phase, "fast" messages are generated and each active k  K, Tx k computes its channel inputs Xkn (Xk,1, . . . , Xk,n)  Rn as

fk(B) Mk(F ), Mk(S), {T(j) k}, A, B , k  Kfast

Xkn = f0k,(S) Mk(S), {T(j) k}, A, B ,

k  (Kactive\Kfast) k  (K\Kactive).

The input-output relation of the network is described as

Yk,t = AkXk,t +

Ak~hk~,kXk~,t + Zk,t, (6)

k~{k-1,k+1}

where {Zk,t} are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) standard Gaussians for all k and t and independent of all messages; hk~,k > 0 with k~  {k - 1, k + 1} is the channel coefficient between Tx k~ and Rx k and is a fixed real number smaller than 1; and X0,t = 0 for all t.
Decoding also takes place in two phases. In the first "fast"-
decoding phase, any active Rx k  Kfast decodes the "fast" message Mk(F ) based on its own channel outputs Ykn by computing:

M^ k(F ) = gk(n) Ykn ,

(7)

for some decoding function gk(n) on appropriate domains. In the subsequent slow-decoding phase, active Rxs first communicate with their active neighbours during DRx  0 rounds over dedicated noise-free links with unlimited capacity, and then
they decode their intended "slow" messages based on their
outputs and based on this exchanged information. Specifically, in each cooperation round j  {1, . . . , DRx}, each active Rx k  Tactive sends a cooperation message

Q(kj)  = (kj)  Ykn, Q(1) k, . . . , Q(j -1k)}Nactive,k , A, B (8)
to Rx  if   Nactive,k for some appropriate function (kj) . After the last cooperation round, each active Rx k  Kactive
decodes its desired "slow" messages as

M^ k(S) = b(kn) Ykn,

The closure of the set of all achievable MG pairs (S(F ), S(S))

is called D-cooperative fundamental MG region and is denoted SD(, f ).
The MG in (14) measures the average expected "slow" MG on the network. Since the "fast" rate is fixed to R(F ) at all
Txs in Kfast, we multiply the MG in (13) by f to obtain the
average expected "fast" MG of the network.

III. MAIN RESULTS

Our first result is an inner bound on SD(, f ). It is based on time-sharing two schemes, one with large "fast" MG and

the other with zero "fast" MG.

Inner and outer bounds are generally very close. They coincide in the extreme cases  = 1 and D  .
Corollary 1: For  = 1 or when D  , Theorem 2 is exact. For  = 1, the fundamental MG region S(, f ) is the set of all nonnegative MG pairs (S(F ), S(S)) satisfying (15) and (18), and for   (0, 1) and D   it is the set of all MG pairs (S(F ), S(S)) satisfying (15) and

S(S) + S(F )  .

Remark 1: In our model, we assume that neighbouring Txs

and neighbouring Rxs can only cooperate if they lie in the

active set Kactive. Txs and Rxs in the inactive set K\Kactive do not participate in the cooperation phases. Notice that all our

results remain valid in a setup where inactive Txs and Rxs

do participate in the cooperation phases. Since our inner and

outer bounds are rather close in general (see the subsequent

numerical discussion), this indicates that without essential loss

in optimality Txs and Rxs in K\Kactive can entirely be set to sleep mode to conserve their batteries.

increase with the activity parameter . The most interesting

part of the bounds is the upper side of the trapezoids, which

lies opposite the two right angles. In particular, the slope of this

side, which is -1 for the outer bounds and -M for the inner bounds, describes the penalty in sum MG S(F ) +S(S) incurred when one increases the "fast" MG S(F ). In the outer bounds,

the sum MG along this line stays constant for all values of the "fast" MG S(F ). In our inner bounds, the sum-MG is reduced

by (M - 1)S when the "fast" MG is increased by S. This

penalty decreases as D increases, and is already negligible for

D = 10 as the three figures illustrate. In fact, for D = 10

the MG region achieved by our inner bounds is close to the

limiting MG regions for D  , indicating that increasing

the number of cooperation rounds beyond 10 provides only a

marginal gain in MG region. As seen in Figure 4, for small user activity parameter  even a small number of cooperation rounds (D = 4) suffices to well approximate the asymptotic MG region for D  . The reason is that a large number of cooperation rounds is only useful in subnets with a large number of consecutive Txs that are active, and such subnets are extraordinarily rare when  is small. Figures 2 and 3 further indicate that the penalty in maximum sum-MG of our inner bounds also decreases when the "fast" activity parameter f increases. For example, for  = 0.6 and D = 4 the sum-MG penalty (M - 1) of the inner bound decreases from 0.08 for f = 0.3 to 0.03 for f = 0.6 (see Figures 3 and 2).
In our previous work [11, Theorem 2] we studied the MG region of the present network but with only Rx-conferencing. In contrast to our results here, in [11] there is always a penalty on the sum-MG when transmitting at positive "fast" MGs. These results indicate that the sum-MG penalty caused by the "fast" transmssions can only be mitigated when both Txs and Rxs can cooperate, but Rx cooperation alone is not sufficient. In fact, in our schemes we mitigate interference from "fast" transmissions on "slow" transmissions via Rx-cooperation and we mitigate interference from "slow" transmissions on "fast" transmissions via Tx-cooperation. In [11] we could only mitigate the former interference but not the latter.

IV. PROOF OF ACHIEVABILITY OF THEOREM 1

We describe two schemes, which through time-sharing

arguments establish the achievability of the inner bound in

Theorem 1. The first scheme transmits at maximum S(F ) =

f 2

,

and

the

second

scheme

at

S(F )

=

0.

Both

schemes

divide the maximum number of cooperation rounds D into

Tx-cooperation and Rx-cooperation rounds as:

DTx = 1 and DRx = D - 1.

(21)

For simplicity we assume D and K even.

A. Scheme 1: Transmitting at large S(F ) We partition K into 2 groups K1 and K2,

K1 {1, 3, . . . , K - 1},

(22)

K2 {2, 4, . . . , K},

(23)

so that all the signals sent by Txs in a group Ki do not interfere with each other, for i = 1, 2. We further divide the total channel transmission time into two equally-sized phases.
(These phases can be interleaved or subsequent, and both
take place after the Tx-cooperation phase and prior to "fast"-
decoding phase.) The idea is that in phase i only Txs in Kfast,i := Ki  Kfast
send a "fast" message, all others do not. 1) Transmitting "fast" messages in the i-th phase: Each
active Tx k  Kfast,i sends its entire "fast" message Mk(F ) and encodes it using a non-precoded codeword Uk(n)(Mk(F )) from a Gaussian codebook of power P. Moreover, during the first
Tx-cooperation round, it receives from its two neighbours, Txs k - 1 and k + 1, quantized versions of their transmit signals, where quantizations are performed at noise levels. Notice that
the neighbouring Txs can share this information because they
only send "slow" messages but no "fast" messages as they are not in Ki and thus neither in Kfast,i.
Tx k  Kfast,i computes its input sequence Xkn as

Xkn = Ukn Mk(F ) -

h-k,1k hk~,k X^ k~n ,

k~Ik(S)

(24)

where Xk~n denotes the quantized signal of Tx k~ and

Ik(S) = {k - 1, k + 1}  (Kactive\Kfast,i)

(25)

The precoding in (24) makes that a "fast" Rx k observes the almost interference-free signal

(b) The last D - 2 Rx-cooperation rounds.

Fig. 5: Example for D = 6 : Tx/Rx pairs in red have "fast" messages to transmit, Tx/Rx pairs in blue have "slow"messages to transmit, Tx/Rx pairs in white are deactivated. We deactivated Txs/Rxs pairs 8 and 20 to satisfy the delay constraint D. Rx 4 and Rx 16 are master Rxs. Tx/Rx pair 19 employs the same coding scheme as the "fast" transmissions.

where the variance of above disturbance is around noise level
and does not grow with P. Each Rx k  Kfast,i decodes its desired "fast" message Mk(F ) based on (26), and during the first Rx-cooperation round it sends the decoded message to
their two neighbouring Rxs k - 1 and k + 1 so that they can

mitigate the interference from "fast" transmissions.

2) Transmitting "slow" messages in the i-th phase: We first introduce some notation. Let k1, k2, . . . be the indices in increasing order of users k for which Ak = 0, i.e., of deactivated users. The Tx-Rx pairs lying in between any of

these two indices form an independent subnet that does not

interfere with the other subnets. We define the users in the j-th
subnet as Ksubnet,j := {kj-1 + 1, . . . , kj - 1}, where we set k0 = 0, and denoting the random total number of subnets by J we set kJ+1 = K + 1.

We explain the encoding and decoding of "slow" messages

independently for each subnet j  {1, . . . , J}. Let Lj := |Ksubnet,j| = kj - kj-1 - 1 denote the size of this subnet.

We split the subnet into smaller non-interfering subnets of at

most D + 1 users. Specifically, if kj-1 + 1  Kfast,i or if Kfast,i  Ksubnet,j = , i.e., when the subnet's first transmitter

sends a "fast" message or all Txs in the subnet send "slow" messages, we silence all Txs k  {kj-1 + c(D + 2)}c=DL+1j2 .

Otherwise, we silence all Txs k  kj-1 + (D + 1), kj-1 +

Lj -D-1

(D + 1) + c(D + 2)

D+2

.

c=1

In each resulting smaller subnet we apply the following

scheme. The first and last Tx/Rx pairs in the small subnet

apply the coding scheme described above for "fast" messages: if the indices of these pairs lie in Kfast,i, then they send their "fast" message using this scheme, and otherwise they

send parts of their "slow" message, but using the same

scheme. All other "slow" Tx/Rx pairs of the small subnet

apply the CoMP reception scheme as for subnets with only "slow" transmissions. Here, the Rxs however first precancel the interference from "fast" transmissions from their receive signals. (Recall that "fast" Rxs shared their decoded messages during the first Rx-cooperation round with their neighbours.) An example of our scheme is illustrated in Figure 5 for D = 6.

3) MG analysis: The described scheme achieves a "fast"

rate

P),

because

each

can

send

its "fast" message only during one of the two phases, but this

message can be decoded based on a interference-free channel.

Thus, by (13), the scheme achieves a "fast" MG of

S(F )

=

f 2

.

(27)

To obtain the average "slow" MG, we first calculate the sum MG achieved by this scheme. To this end, we notice that given that the j-th subnet exists (i.e., J > j) and starts at index kj-1 + 1, then the subnet's random length Lj satisfies:

P[Lj = ] = P,kj-1+1,  = 0, 1, 2, . . . , (28)

where for each k  Kactive:

(1 - ), if  < K - k + 1,

P,k := ,

if  = K - k + 1,

(29)

0,

otherwise.

Moreover, in the presented scheme, all scheduled transmissions can be performed at MG 1/2, because interference can perfectly be mitigated and because we have two equally-long phases i = 1, 2. Therefore, conditioned on the facts that the j-th subnet exists, starts at index kj-1 + 1, and is of length

Lj = , the random sum-MG achieved over this subnet during phase i is:

B. Scheme 2: Transmitting at S(F ) = 0:

Similar to scheme 1, except that in each subnet Txs only
send "slow" messages. There is no need to have two phases and in each subnet j we silence Txs k  {kj-1 + c(D + 2)}c=DL+1j2 .
1) MG analysis: The scheme achieves "fast" MG

S(F ) = 0.

(45)

We can obtain the average "slow" MG similarly to before, but now the sum-MG over the j-th subnet which starts at index kj-1 + 1 and is of length Lj =  is:

Ssum(kj-1 + 1, ) =  -

 D+2

.

(46)

The average "slow" MG achieved by this scheme is thus

S(S)

=

When  = 1, then the average "slow" MG is equal to

(47e)

K

S(S) = 1 - lim
K 

D+2
K

=

D D

+ +

1 2

.

(48)

When   (0, 1), one can prove that the terms in (47d) and (47e) go to zero as K  , establishing achievability of

"slow" MG

S(S)

=



-

(1 - )D+2 1 - D+2

.

(49)

where the inequality in (a) comes from the fact that the

maximum sum MG in a subnet of  consecutive active Txs

is equal to  -

 D+2

. For more details, see [12, Chapter 5,

Proposition 2]. Letting K   proves (18) for  = 1 and

(19) for   (0, 1).

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
We proposed coding schemes to simultaneously transmit delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant traffic over Wyner's symmetric network with randomly activated users. In our scheme, each active transmitter always has a "slow" (delay-tolerant) data to send and with a certain probability also sends an additional "fast" (delay-sensitive) data. Active transmitters and receivers are allowed to cooperate during total D rounds but only "slow" transmissions can benefit from cooperation. We derived inner and outer bound on the MG region. When D   or when all the transmitters are active, the bounds coincide and the results show that transmitting "fast" messages does not cause any penalty on the sum MG. For finite D our bounds are still close and prove that the penalty caused

by "fast" transmissions is small. This should in particular be considered in view of scheduling algorithms [5] where transmission of "fast" messages inherently causes a penalty on the sum-MG that is linear in the "fast" MG.
Future interesting research directions include the twodimensional hexagonal model, which we studied in [11]. We conjecture that also for this hexagonal model, a combination of Tx- and Rx-cooperation allows to mitigate most of the interference and essentially eliminate any penalty caused by transmission of "fast" messages. As we showed in our previous work [11], this is not possible under Rx-cooperation only. Excellent interference cancellation performance is also expected for multi-antenna setups.
