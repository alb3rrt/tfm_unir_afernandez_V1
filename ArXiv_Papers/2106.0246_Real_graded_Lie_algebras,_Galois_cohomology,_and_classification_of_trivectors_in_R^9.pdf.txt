REAL GRADED LIE ALGEBRAS, GALOIS COHOMOLOGY, AND CLASSIFICATION OF TRIVECTORS IN R9
MIKHAIL BOROVOI, WILLEM DE GRAAF, AND HO^ NG VA^ N LE^
Abstract. In this paper we classify real trivectors in dimension 9. The corresponding classification over the field C of complex numbers was done by Vinberg and Elashvili in 1978. One of the main tools used for their classification was the construction of the representation of SL(9, C) on the space of complex trivectors of C9 as a thetarepresentation corresponding to a Z/3Z-grading of the simple complex Lie algebra of type E8. This divides the trivectors into three groups: nilpotent, semisimple, and mixed trivectors. Our classification follows the same pattern. We use Galois cohomology to obtain the classification over R. For the nilpotent orbits this is in principle rather straightforward and the main problem is to determine the first Galois cohomology sets of a long list of centralizers (we compute the centralizers using computer). For the semisimple and mixed orbits we develop new methods based on Galois cohomology, first and second. We also consider real theta-representations in general, and derive a number of results that are useful for the classification of their orbits.

1. Introduction
Let V be an n-dimensional vector space over a field k. The group GL(V ) naturally acts on the spaces k V . The elements of 2 V are called bivectors. The elements of 3 V are called trivectors. If the ground field is R or C, then the orbits of GL(V ) on the space of bivectors can be listed for all n (see [Gurevich1964], §34). The situation for trivectors is much more complicated and a lot of effort has gone into finding orbit classifications for particular n. For n up to 5 it is straightforward to obtain the orbits of GL(V ) on the space of trivectors (see [Gurevich1964], §35). The classification for higher n and k = C goes back to the thesis of Reichel ([Reichel1907]) who classified the orbits for n = 6 and with a few omissions also for n = 7. In 1931 Schouten published a classification for n = 7 ([Schouten1931]). In 1935 Gurevich obtained a classification for n = 8 ([Gurevich1935], see also [Gurevich1964], §35). In these cases the number of orbits is finite. This ceases to be the case for n  9. Vinberg and Elashvili classified the orbits of trivectors for n = 9 under the group SL(V ) ([VE1978]). In this classification there are several parametrized families of orbits. The maximum number of parameters of such a family is 4.
More recently classifications have appeared for different fields. For n = 6, Revoy [Revoy1979] gave a classification for arbitrary field k. For n = 7, Westwick [Westwick1981] classified the trivectors for k = R, Cohen and Helminck [CH1988] treated the case of a perfect field k of cohomological dimension  1 (which includes finite fields), and Noui and Revoy [NR1994] treated the cases of a perfect field of cohomological dimension  1

and of a p-adic field. For n = 8, Djokovi´c [Djokovi´c1983] treated the case k = R, Noui [Noui1997] treated the case of an algebraically closed field k of arbitrary characteristic, and Midoune and Noui [MN2013] treated the case of a finite field. For n = 9, Hora and Pudl´ak [HP2020] treated the case of the finite field F2 of two elements. In the present paper we give a classification of trivectors under the action of SL(V ) for n = 9 and k = R.
For their classification Vinberg and Elashvili used a particular construction of the action of SL(V ) on 3 V (dim V = 9, k = C). They considered the complex Lie algebra gC of type E8 and its adjoint group G (here G is equal to the automorphism group of gC). This Lie algebra has a Z3-grading gC = gC-1  gC0  gC1 such that gC0 = sl(9, C). Let G0 be the connected algebraic subgroup of G with Lie algebra gC0. Since the Lie algebra gC0 preserves gC1 when acting on gC, the same is true for the group G0. An isomorphism  : sl(9, C)  gC0 lifts to a surjective morphism of algebraic groups  : SL(9, C)  G0. This also defines an action of SL(9, C) on gC1, and it turns out that gC1 = 3 C9 as SL(9, C)-modules. This construction pertains to Vinberg's theory of -groups ([Vinberg1975], [Vinberg1976], [Vinberg1979]). So this theory can be used to study the orbits of trivectors when n = 9. Among the technical tools that this makes available we mention the following:
· The elements of gC1 have a Jordan decomposition, that is, every x  gC1 can be uniquely written as x = s + n where s  gC1 is semisimple (i.e., its G0-orbit is closed), n  gC1 is nilpotent (i.e., the closure of its orbit contains 0) and [s, n] = 0. This naturally splits the orbits into three types according to whether the elements of the orbit are nilpotent, semisimple, or mixed (that is, neither semisimple nor nilpotent). So also the classification problem splits into three subproblems. We also remark that an element y  gC1 is semisimple (respectively nilpotent) if and only if the linear map ad y : gC  gC is semisimple (respectively nilpotent).
· Any nilpotent e  gC1 lies in a homogeneous sl2-triple, meaning that there are h  gC0, f  gC-1 with [h, e] = 2e, [h, f ] = -2f , [e, f ] = h. The G0-orbits of e and of the triple (h, e, f ) determine each other. Furthermore, e lies in a carrier algebra and the theory of these algebras can be used to classify the nilpotent orbits ([Vinberg1979]).
· A Cartan subspace is a maximal subspace C of gC1 consisting of commuting semisimple elements. Any other Cartan subspace is conjugate to C under the action of G0. Each semisimple orbit has a point in C. Furthermore, two elements of C are G0-conjugate if and only if they are conjugate under the finite group W = NG0(C)/ZG0(C) called the Weyl group of the graded Lie algebra gC, or also the little Weyl group.
· Fix a semisimple element s  gC1, let Zs denote the stabilizer of s in SL(9, C), and let zgC(s) denote the centralizer of s in gC. Then the grading of gC induces a grading of its Lie subalgebra zgC(s), and the classification of the orbits of mixed elements s + e, where e is nilpotent, reduces to the classification of the nilpotent Zs-orbits in the graded Lie algebra zgC(s).
Over the real numbers we use a similar construction of the action of SL(V ) on 3 V . There is a Chevalley basis of gC such that the Z3-grading is defined over R (that is, the spaces gCi for i = -1, 0, 1 all have bases whose elements are R-linear combinations of the given basis of gC). By gi for i = -1, 0, 1 we denote the real spans of these bases. Then g0 is isomorphic to sl(9, R). We can define  in such a way that it restricts to an isomorphism  : sl(9, R)  g0. Then also  is defined over R and restricts to a surjective homomorphism  : SL(9, R)  G0(R). In this way g1 becomes an SL(9, R)-module isomorphic to 3 R9. In order to use this set-up for classifying orbits, we need to extend a number of constructions for graded Lie algebras from the complex setting to the real setting. This is done in Section 4.

As in the earlier works on classification of trivectors [Revoy1979] and [Djokovi´c1983], our main workhorse for classifying the SL(9, R)-orbits on 3 R9 is Galois cohomology. Very briefly this amounts to the following. Let O be an SL(9, C)-orbit in 3 C9. We are interested in determining the SL(9, R)-orbits that are contained in O  3 R9. It can happen that this intersection is empty (we say that O has no real points). In that case we just discard O. On the other hand, if O has a real point x, then we consider the stabilizer Zx of x in SL(9, C). The SL(9, R)-orbits contained in O are in bijection with the first Galois cohomology set H1Zx := H1(R, Zx). Moreover, from an explicit cocycle representing a cohomology class in H1Zx , we can effectively compute a representative of the corresponding real orbit. Section 3 has further details on Galois cohomology over R and methods to compute first Galois cohomology sets in a quite general setting.
To classify the nilpotent SL(9, R)-orbits we execute the above procedure. It is shown that every nilpotent SL(9, C)-orbit in 3 C9 has a real point (Proposition 4.3.21). However, instead of a real point e in the orbit, we work with a real homogeneous sl2-triple t = (h, e, f ) containing it. Since nilpotent orbits correspond bijectively to orbits of homogeneous sl2triples, it suffices to compute the stabilizer Zt of the triple t and to determine the set H1Zt. In Section 5.1 we describe the computational methods that we have used to determine Zt. Section 6 has the details of the determination of the Galois cohomology sets.
In [VE1978] an explicit Cartan subspace C of gC1 is given. In C seven canonical sets are defined with the property that every semisimple orbit has a point in one of the canonical sets. Moreover, two elements of the same canonical set have the same stabilizer in SL(9, C). Let F be such a canonical set. Let N be its normalizer in SL(9, C) (N is the set of g  SL(9, C) with gp  F for all p  F) and let Z be its centralizer in SL(9, C) (Z is the set of all g  SL(9, C) with gp = p for all p  F). Write A = N /Z. In all cases we have that A is isomorphic to a subgroup of the little Weyl group W , with the isomorphism respecting the actions of A and W on F. We explicitly determine these subgroups. In Section 7 we divide the complex orbits of the elements of F having real points into several classes that are in bijection with the Galois cohomology set H1A. For each class we can explicitly find a real representative of each orbit in this class. Let q be such a real representative, and let Zq be its centralizer in SL(9, C). Then the real orbits contained in the SL(9, C)-orbit of q are in bijection with H1Zq. In Section 7 we find that H1Zq always happens to be trivial (contains only one element 1).
Section 8 is devoted to the elements of mixed type. To classify the orbits consisting of mixed elements, we fix a real semisimple element p and consider the problem of listing the SL(9, R)-orbits of mixed elements having a representative of the form p + e where e is nilpotent and [p, e] = 0. Let Zp(R) denote the stabilizer of p in SL(9, R). Let a = zg(p) be the centralizer of p in g. Note that the grading of g induces a grading on a. Then our problem amounts to classifying the nilpotent Zp(R)-orbits in a1. In principle this can be done with Galois cohomology in the same way as for the nilpotent SL(9, R)-orbits in g1. In this case, however, there is a nasty detail. If the reductive subalgebra a is not split over R, then it can happen that certain complex nilpotent orbits in aC1 (where aC = zgC(p)) do not have real points. In Section 8 we develop a method for checking whether a complex nilpotent orbit has real points and for finding one in the affirmative case. Among other things, this method uses calculations in the second (abelian) Galois cohomology group.
The main results of this paper are the tables in Section 2 containing representatives of the orbits of SL(9, R) in 3 R9.
In order to obtain the results of this paper, essential use of the computer has been made. In Section 5 we give details of the computational methods that we used. For the implementation of these methods we have used the computer algebra system GAP4 [GAP]

and its package SLA [GT2019]. For the computations involving Gro¨bner bases we have used the computer algebra system Singular [DGPS].
Finally we would like to add a few more motivations for the problem of classification of trivectors of R9 and put our method in a broader perspective. Special geometries defined by differential forms are of central significance in Riemannian geometry and in physics; see [HL1982], [Hitchin2000], [Joyce2007]; see also [LV2020] for a survey. One of important problems in geometry defined by differential forms is to understand the orbit space of the standard GL(n, R)-action on the vector space k(Rn) of alternating k-forms on Rn, which is in a bijection with the orbit space of the standard GL(n, R)-action on the space of k-vectors k Rn. For general k and n, this classification problem is intractable. In the case of trivectors of R8 and R9, this classification problem is tractable thanks to its formulation as an equivalent problem for graded semisimple Lie algebras, discovered first by Vinberg in his works [Vinberg1975, Vinberg1976]. Semisimple graded Lie algebras and their adjoint orbits play an important role in geometry and supersymmetries; see [WG1968], [Nahm1978], [Kac1995], [CS2009], [Swann1991].

Acknowledgements. We are indebted to Alexander Elashvili for his discussions with us on his work with Vinberg [VE1978] and related problems in graded semisimple Lie algebras over years; it was he who brought us together for working on this paper. We are grateful to Domenico Fiorenza for his helpful comments on an early version of this paper.
1.1. Notation and conventions. Here we briefly describe some notation and conventions that we use in the paper.
By Z, Q, R, C we denote, respectively, the ring of integers and the fields of rational, real, and complex numbers. By i  C we denote an imaginary unit.
By µn we denote the cyclic group consisting of the n-th roots of unity in C. Occasionally by µn we denote the set of matrices consisting of scalar matrices with an n-th root of unity on the diagonal. From the context it will be clear what is meant.
If G is a group, then by NG(A), ZG(A) we denote the normalizer and centralizer in G of A. If v is an element of a G-module then ZG(v) denotes the stabilizer of v in G.
If g is a Lie algebra then zg(A) denotes the centralizer of A in g. We write  for the group Gal(C/R) = {1, }, where  is the complex conjugation. By a -group we mean a group A on which  acts by automorphisms. Clearly, a -group is a pair (A, ),where A is a group and  : A  A is an automorphism of A such that 2 = idA . If a  A, we write a for (a).
For a linear algebraic group over R (for brevity R-group) we mean a pair M = (M, ), where M is a linear algebraic group over C, and  is an anti-regular involution of M (C); see Subsection 3.3. Then  naturally acts on M (C) (namely, the complex conjugation  acts as ). In other words, M (C) naturally is a -group.
Let T be a diagonalizable algebraic group. By X(T ) = Hom(T, C×) we denote the character group of T , where Hom denotes the group of homomorphisms of algebraic Cgroups. By X(T ) = Hom(C×, T ) we denote the cocharacter group of T .
In this paper the spaces 3 C9 and 3 R9 play a major role. We let e1, . . . , e9 denote the standard basis of C9 (or of R9). Then by eijk we denote the basis vector ei  ej  ek of 3 C9 (or of 3 R9).

2. The tables
In this section we list the representatives of the orbits of SL(9, R) on 3 R9. Except for the semisimple orbits we list the representatives in tables. We also give various centralizers in the real Lie algebra sl(9, R). These centralizers are always reductive. For the semisimple subalgebras we use standard notation for the real forms of the complex simple Lie algebras. By t we denote a 1-dimensional subalgebra of sl(9, R) spanned by a semisimple matrix all of whose eigenvalues are real. By u we denote a 1-dimensional subalgebra of sl(9, R) spanned by a semisimple matrix all of whose eigenvalues are imaginary.
We recall that by eijk we denote the basis vector ei  ej  ek, where e1, . . . , e9 are the standard basis vectors of R9.

2.1. The nilpotent orbits. Table 1 contains representatives of the nilpotent orbits of SL(9, R) on 3 R9. In the first column we list the number of the complex orbit as contained in Table 6 of [VE1978]. The second column has the characteristic of the complex orbit (see Definition 4.3.4 for this concept). In the third column we give the dimension d of the complex orbit. The fourth column lists the rank ds of a trivector e in the complex orbit, that is, the minimal dimension of a subspace U of C9 such that e  3 U . Let t = (e, h, f ) be a homogeneous sl2-triple containing a representative e of the complex orbit. Let ZSL(9,C)(t) denote the stabilizer in SL(9, C) of t. The fifth and sixth columns have, respectively, the size of the component group K of ZSL(9,C)(t) and a description of the structure of K. We omit the latter when the component group has order 1 or prime order. The seventh column has representatives of all SL(9, R)-orbits contained in the complex orbit. The last column has a description of the structure of the centralizer in sl(9, R) of a real homogeneous sl2-triple t = (e, h, f ) containing the real representative e in the same line.

p1 = e123 + e456 + e789
p2 = e147 + e258 + e369
p3 = e159 + e267 + e348
p4 = e168 + e249 + e357
span a Cartan subspace in gC1 denoted C. Each complex semisimple orbit has a point in this space. This can still be refined a bit: in [VE1978] seven canonical sets F1, . . . , F7 in C are described with the property that each complex semisimple orbit has a point in one of the Fi. The real semisimple orbits are divided into two groups, the canonical and the noncanonical semisimple elements. We say that a real semisimple element is canonical if it lies in one of the Fi (or more generally, if it is SL(9, R)-conjugate to an element of one of the Fi). The noncanonical elements are those that are SL(9, C)-conjugate (but not SL(9, R)-conjugate) to elements of an Fi.
Below we give the representatives of the orbits of canonical and noncanonical semisimple elements. The representatives of the noncanonical orbits do not lie in C. However, because over R we have that g1 has a unique Cartan subspace (Theorem 7.4.1), they are SL(9, R)conjugate to elements of C. In each case we also give these elements. For computing the mixed elements we have preferred to work with the representatives that lie outside of C because with the representatives in C the nilpotent parts tend to become a bit bulky (see Section 2.3).
Finally, for each parametrized class we give a finite matrix group that determines when different elements of the same class are conjugate. More precisely, consider a class of

10

semisimple elements p(1, . . . , m), where i  R must satisfy certain polynomial conditions. Write  for the column vector consisting of the i. Let µ be a second column vector with coordinates µ1, . . . , µm. Then we describe a finite matrix group G with the property that p(1, . . . , m) and p(µ1, . . . , µm) are SL(9, R)-conjugate if and only if there is a g  G with g ·  = µ. We express this by saying that the conjugacy of the elements p(1, . . . , m) is determined by G.
Canonical set F1: The real elements in F1 consist of p1,11,2,3,4 = 1p1 + 2p2 + 3p3 + 4p4
where the i  R are such that
1234 = 0
(32 + 33 + 34)3 - (3234)3 = 0 (31 + 33 + 34)3 + (3134)3 = 0 (31 + 32 + 34)3 + (3124)3 = 0 (31 + 32 + 33)3 + (3123)3 = 0.

There are no noncanonical real semisimple elements that are SL(9, C)-conjugate to elements of F1.
The conjugacy of the elements p1,11,2,3,4 is determined by a group of order 48, isomorphic to GL(2, F3) and generated by

123(31 - 32)(32 - 33)(33 - 31)[(31 + 32 + 33)3 - (3123)3] = 0.

123(31 - 32)(32 - 33)(33 - 31)[(31 + 32 + 33)3 + (3123)3] = 0.

So for p3,12,2 the i are required to satisfy 12(61 - 62) = 0. For p3,13,2 the i are required to satisfy 12(61 + 62) = 0. For p3,,4µ the , µ are required to satisfy µ(34 - 102µ2 + 3µ4) = 0.

We have that p3,12,2, p3,13,2 , p3,,4µ are SL(9, R)-conjugate to respectively

Canonical set F4: The real elements in F4 consist of p4,,1µ = p1 + µ(p3 - p4)

Canonical set F7: this set consists just of 0.

2.3. The mixed orbits. Here we give tables of representatives of the orbits of mixed
type. The representatives of those orbits have a semisimple part which is equal to
one of the semisimple elements listed above. So the semisimple parts are of the form p2,11,2,3 , p2,12,2,3 , . . .. For each such semisimple part we have a table listing the possible nilpotent parts. (Note that the centralizer of p1,11,2,3,4 in gC is trivial, so there are no mixed elements with this particular element as semisimple part.)

In the previous subsection we also computed elements of the Cartan subspace that

are SL(9, R)-conjugate to the elements p2,12,2,3, p3,12,2 , . . .. However we do not work with those, because the semisimple parts tend to become rather complicated. For example, the

mixed element p6,2 - 2e137 is SL(9, R)-conjugate to

All tables have three columns. The first column has the number of the complex nilpotent orbit, which corresponds to the numbering in [VE1978]. The second column has the representatives of the real nilpotent orbits. In the third column we display the isomorphism type of the centralizer in zg0(p) of a homogeneous sl2-triple in zg(p) containing the nilpotent element on the same line. Among the nilpotent elements we also include 0; in that case the centralizer is equal to zg0(p).

3. Real Galois cohomology

3.1. Group cohomology for a group of order 2. In this subsection we give an alternative definition of H1(, A) and H2(, A) and establish their properties.

Definition 3.1.1. Let A be a -group, not necessarily abelian, where  = {1, } is a group of order 2. We define

(3.1.2)

Z1A = {c  A | c · c = 1}.

We say that an element c as in (3.1.2) is a 1-cocycle of  in A. The group A acts on Z1A on the right by
c  a = a-1 · c · a for c  Z1A, a  A.
We say that the cocycles c and ca are cohomologous or equivalent. We denote by H1(, A), or for brevity H1A, the set of equivalence classes, that is, the set of orbits of A in Z1A. If c  Z1A, we denote by [c]  H1A its cohomology class.

In general H1A has no natural group structure, but it has a neutral element denoted by [1], the class of the unit element 1  Z1A  A.

MIKHAIL BOROVOI, WILLEM DE GRAAF, AND HO^ NG VA^ N LE^

Definition 3.1.3. Let A be an abelian -group, written additively, where  is a group of order 2. We define
Z1A = {c  A | c + c = 0}, B1A = {a - a | a  A}.

We set which is an abelian group.

H1A = Z1A/B1A,

Definition 3.1.4. Let A be an abelian -group written additively, where  is a group of order 2. We define
Z2A = A := {c  A | c = c}, B2A = {a + a | a  A}.

We set which is an abelian group.

H2A = Z2A/B2A,

Remark 3.1.5. Definitions 3.1.3 and 3.1.4 (given for a group  of order 2 only!) are equivalent to the standard ones. Namely, for c  Z1A we construct a function of one
variable fc :   A, fc(1) = 1, fc() = c,
which is a 1-cocycle in the sense of [Serre1997, Section I.5.1]. Similarly, for c  Z2A we
construct a function of two variables

c :  ×   A, c(1, 1) = c(, 1) = c(1, ) = 0, c(, ) = c,
which is a 2-cocycle in the sense of [Serre1997, Section I.2.2]. In this way we obtain canonical isomorphisms of pointed sets (for Definition 3.1.1), and of abelian groups (for Definitions 3.1.3 and 3.1.4) between the cohomology sets and groups defined above and the corresponding cohomology sets and groups defined in [Serre1997].

We shall consider the following -groups:

(1) Ztriv is Z with the trivial -action x = x; (2) Ztw is Z with the twisted -action x = -x; (3) Z2tw+ is Z2 with the twisted -action (x, y) = (y, x); (4) Zt2w- is Z2 with the twisted -action (x, y) = (-y, -x).

We have an isomorphism Z2tw+  Z2tw- ,
Examples 3.1.6. (1) H1 Ztriv = 0; (2) H2 Ztriv = Z/2Z; (3) H1 Ztw = Z/2Z; (4) H2 Ztw = 0; (5) H1 Z2tw+ = 0 and H2 Z2tw+ = 0; (6) H1 Z2tw- = 0 and H2 Z2tw- = 0.

We have an isomorphism (C×)2tw+  (C×)2tw- , (x, y)  (x, y-1).

(6) H1 (C×)2tw- = 1 and H2 (C×)2tw- = 1.

Remark 3.1.8. The assertions of Examples 3.1.7, which follow easily from the definitions, are special cases of more general results. In particular, Example 3.1.7(1) is Hilbert's Theorem 90 for R. Example 3.1.7(2) is the well-known fact that the Brauer group Br(R) := H2(, C×st) is of order 2. The assertions of Examples 3.1.7(5) and (6) follow from a lemma of Faddeev and Shapiro; see [Serre1997, I.2.5, Proposition 10].

3.1.9. Twisting. Let B be a -group acting -equivariantly on a -group A

(b, a)  b(a).

Let b  Z1B be a 1-cocycle, that is,

(3.1.10)

b · b = 1B .

We define the b-twisted -group bA. It has the same underlying group A and a new -action

(3.1.11)

a = b(a).

It follows from the cocycle condition (3.1.10) that

(a) = a for all a  A,

that is, (3.1.11) is indeed a -action on A.

Note that the -groups A and bA have the same underlying groups. In particular, if A is a finite group of odd order, then bA is a finite group of odd order too.

3.1.12. Let a  Z1A. The group A acts on itself by inner automorphisms, and so we obtain the twisted group aA.
We define a map ta : Z1aA  Z1A, x  xa.
We check that ta(x) is indeed a 1-cocycle. We have a  Z1A, hence a· a = 1. Furthermore, x  Z1aA, hence, x · a xa-1 = 1. We obtain:
ta(x) · (ta(x)) = xa · xa = (x · axa-1) · (a · a) = 1 · 1 = 1,

as required.

The map ta is a bijection taking 1 to a. We show that it sends cohomologous cocycles to cohomologous cocycles. Indeed, let x, y  Z1aA, and assume that x  y. Then there exists b  A such that
y = b-1 · x · b = b-1 · x · ab a-1.

Then

ta(y) = b-1 · x · ab a-1 · a = b-1 · xa · b = b-1 · ta(x) · b  ta(x),

as required. Thus the map ta induces a map

(3.1.13)

a : H1aA  H1A, [x]  [xa].

One can easily check that a-1  Z1aA and that the map

ta-1 : Z1A  Z1aA, y  y a-1.

is inverse to ta. By passing to cohomology, we obtain that the map

a-1 : H1aA  H1A, [y]  [y a-1].

20

MIKHAIL BOROVOI, WILLEM DE GRAAF, AND HO^ NG VA^ N LE^

is inverse to a. Thus a is a bijection.
3.1.14. Let  : A  B be a morphism of -groups. Let a  Z1A, and write b = (a)  Z1B. Then by twisting we obtain a homomorphism

a: aA  bB, and it is easy to see that the following diagram is commutative:

H1aA a / H1bB

a
 H1A

b
  / H1B

We shall need the following result of Borel and Serre:

Proposition 3.1.15 ([Serre1997, Section I.5.4, Corollary 1 of Proposition 36]). Let B be a -group, A  B be a -subgroup, and Y = B/A, which has a natural structure of a -set. Then there is a canonical exact sequence of pointed sets
1  A  B  Y  --- H1A  H1B. Moreover, the group B naturally acts on Y , and the connecting map  induces a canonical bijection between the set of orbits Y /B and the kernel
ker H1A  H1B .

Proposition 3.1.16 ([Serre1997, Section I.5.5, Proposition 38]). Let

(3.1.17)

1  A ---i B --j- C  1

be a short exact sequence of -groups. Then the following sequence of pointed sets is exact:

(3.1.18)

1  A  B  C --- H1A --i- H1B --j- H1C.

Proof. It suffices to show that if   ker j  H1B, then there exists   H1A such that j() = .
Let   ker[H1B --j H1C].
Write  = [b], where b  Z1B  B. Then j(b) is a coboundary in C, that is, there exists c  C such that
(c)-1 · j(b) · c = 1  C. Let b  B be a preimage of c. Then
a := (b)-1 · b · b  A,
where we identify A with i(A)  B. Clearly, a is a cocycle, that is, a  Z1A. Write  = [a]  H1(, A). Then
i() = [a] = [b] = ,
as required.
Corollary 3.1.19. In Proposition 3.1.16, assume that H1A = {1} and H1C = {1}. Then H1B = {1}.

Proof. Let   H1(, B). Then j() = 1, because H1C = {1}. By Proposition 3.1.16 we have  = j() for some   H1A. Since H1A = {1}, we see that  = 1, and hence,  = 1, as required.

We wish to describe the fibers of the map i : H1A  H1B.

Construction 3.1.20. For an exact sequence (3.1.17), we construct a right action of C on H1A. Let c  C. We lift c to b  B. Then b = b · x for some x  A. To each cocycle a  Z1A, we associate the cocycle
a = b-1abx = b-1 · a · b  Z1A.

We define

[a] · c = [a].

Proposition 3.1.21 (Serre, [Serre1997, I.5.5, Proposition 39]). (i) If c  C, then (c) = 1 · c, where 1  H1A is the neutral element.
(ii) Two elements of H1A have the same image in H1B if and only if they are in the
same C-orbit. (iii) Let a  Z1A, write  = [a]  H1A, and let c  C. For  · c = , it is necessary
and sufficient that c  im[(aB)  C ].

[We denote by aB the group obtained by twisting B with the cocycle a, with A acting on B by inner automorphisms.]

Proof. The equality (c) = 1 · c follows from the definition of . On the other hand, if two cocycles a, a  Z1A are cohomologous in B, then there exists b  B such that a = b-1 · a · b. If c is the image of b in C, then c = c, whence c  C, and it is clear that [a] · c = [a]. Conversely, if [a] = [a] · c, then a = b-1 · a · b for a preimage b of c, whence a  a in B, which proves (ii). Finally, if b  B is a lift of c, and  · c = , then there exists x  A such that a = x-1b-1a b x. This can be also written as bx = a (bx)a-1, that is, bx  (aB). Clearly, the image of bx in C is c; hence (iii).
Corollary 3.1.22. The kernel of H1B  H1C can be identified with the quotient of H1A by the action of the group C.

Proof. This follows from Proposition 3.1.21(ii).
Corollary 3.1.23. Let   H1B,  = [b], where b  Z1B. Then the map on cocycles a  ab : Z1bA  Z1B
induces a surjective map on cohomology H1bA  j-1(j())  H1B,
which in turn induces a bijection H1bA/(cC)  j-1(j()),
where c = j(b)  C. Here for a  Z1 bA, the stabilizer in (cC) of [a]  H1 bA is the image of the homomorphism (abB)  (cC).
[The group B acts on itself by inner automorphisms, and leaves A stable. This allows us to twist the exact sequence (3.1.17) by the cocycle b or by the cocycle ab, as in Subsection 3.1.14.]

Proof. This follows from Corollary 3.1.22 and Proposition 3.1.21(iii) by twisting as in Subsection 3.1.14.

Corollary 3.1.24. Assume that the exact sequence of -groups (3.1.17) admits a splitting , that is, a homomorphism of -groups

: C B

such that j   = idC. For c  Z1C consider the twisted exact sequence

(3.1.25)

1  cA  cB  cC  1

22

MIKHAIL BOROVOI, WILLEM DE GRAAF, AND HO^ NG VA^ N LE^

and the splitting c : cC  cB
where by abuse of notation we write cA for (c)A and cB for (c)B. Then:

(i) The homomorphism j : B  C is surjective. (ii) The map j : H1B  H1C is surjective.
(iii) The split exact sequence (3.1.25) induces a bijection

(3.1.26)

(H1cA)/(cC) --- j-1[c],

where (cC) acts on the right on H1 cA by

(3.1.27)

[a] · c = [(c)-1a (c)] for a  Z1 cA, c  (cC).

(iv) The bijections of (iii) for all [c]  H1C induce a canonical bijection

(H1cA)/(cC) --- H1B,
[c]H1C

where  denotes the disjoint union.

Proof. Assertions (i) and (ii) follow by functoriality from the formula j  = idC. Assertion (iv) follows from (ii) and (iii). We obtain the bijection (3.1.26) in (iii) from Corollary 3.1.23.
It remains to prove formula (3.1.27). Let c  (cC). Set b = (c)  (cB). By Construction 3.1.20 we have
[a] · c = [(b)-1a b] = [(b)-1ab] = [(c)-1a (c)],
where b denote the image of b under the c-twisted action of , and b = b because b  (cB). This completes the proof of the corollary.
Corollary 3.1.28. In Corollary 3.1.24(iii):
(i) the group (cC) acts on [1]  H1cA trivially; (ii) If #H1cA > 1, then #j-1[c] > 1.

Proof. Assertion (i) follows from formula (3.1.27), and (ii) follows from (i) and (3.1.26).

Lemma 3.1.29. Let
1ABC1
be an exact sequence of -groups. Let c  C be such that c2 = 1 (then c  Z1C ). Assume that c is the image of some b  Z1B (then b = b-1). Consider the twisted exact sequence

Then for [1]  H1A we have

1  bA  bB  cC  1.

[1] · c = [a], where a = b-2  A.

In particular, if b2 = 1, then [1] · c = [1].

Proof. By definition, [1] · c is the class of the cocycle b-11b = b-1b b b-1 = b-1b-1 = b-2.

Construction 3.1.30. Let

(3.1.31)

1  A --i B --j C  1

be a short exact sequence of -groups, where the subgroup i(A) of B is central that is, contained in the center of B). Let c  Z1C. We lift c to an element b of B (which need

TRIVECTORS IN R9

23

not to be a cocycle) and set a = b · b  A. One check immediately that a  Z2A and that in this way we obtain a well-defined map
 : H1C  H2A.

Proposition 3.1.32 (Serre, [Serre1997, I.5.7, Proposition 43]). If in the exact sequence (3.1.31), i(A) is central in B, then the following sequence of pointed sets is exact:
1  A  B  C --- H1A --i- H1B --j- H1C --- H2A.

Proof. Exercise.

3.2. Group cohomology with coefficients in a group of order 2pn. We give an alternative proof of the following well-known result [AW1967, Section 6, Corollary 1 of Proposition 8].
Lemma 3.2.1. For  = {1, }, an abelian -group A, and any   HnA (n = 1, 2), we have 2 = 0  HnA.

Proof. We prove for n = 1. Let   H1A,  = [c], c  Z1A, that is, c  A and c = -c. Then 2c = c + c = c - c  B1A. Thus 2 = [2c] = 0, as required.
We prove for n = 2. Let   H2A,  = [c], c  Z2A, that is, c  A and c = c. Then 2c = c + c = c + c  B2A. Thus 2 = [2c] = 0, as required.
Corollary 3.2.2. Let A be a finite abelian -group of odd order 2m+1, where  = {1, } is a group of order 2. Then H1A = 0 and H2A = 0.

Proof. Let n = 1 or n = 2, and let   HnA,  = [c], where c  ZnA  A. Then (2m + 1)c = 0, and hence, (2m + 1) = 0. On the other hand, by Lemma 3.2.1 we have 2 = 0. We see that
 = (2m + 1) - m · (2) = 0 - m · 0 = 0.
Lemma 3.2.3. Let A be a -group,and let M  A be a normal abelian finite -subgroup of odd order. Then the canonical map
H1A  H1(A/M )
is bijective.

Proof. First we prove the lemma in the case when M is central, that is, M  Z(A). Write B = A/M . Since M is central, the short exact sequence
1  M --i A --j B  1
induces a cohomology exact sequence
· · ·  H1M --i H1A --j H1B  H2M.
By Corollary 3.2.2 we have H2M = {1}, and hence, j is surjective. Since M is central, by Corollary 3.1.23 each fiber of j comes from H1M . Since by Corollary 3.2.2 we have H1M = {1}, we see that each fiber of j has only one element, that is, j is injective. Thus j is bijective, as required.
The case of noncentral M is a bit more delicate. Let [b]  H1B, b  Z1B. Then the obstruction (b) for lifting [b] to H1A lives in H2 bM ; see [Serre1997, I.5.6, Proposition 41]. Here bM denotes the group M twisted by the cocycle b  Z1B, where B naturally acts on M . Note that bM has the same underlying group as M , only the -action changes. Therefore, bM is a group of odd order and hence we have H2 bM = {1} by Corollary 3.2.2.

24

MIKHAIL BOROVOI, WILLEM DE GRAAF, AND HO^ NG VA^ N LE^

We see that (b) = 1 and [b] lifts to H1A. Thus j is surjective; cf. [Serre1997, I.5.6, Corollary to Proposition 41].
Furthermore, for any a  Z1A, the fiber j-1(j([a]))  H1A comes from H1aM ; see [Serre1997, I.5.5, Corollary 2 to Proposition 39]. We have H1aM = {1} by Corollary 3.2.2 because aM is of odd order. Thus each fiber of j has only one element, that is, j is injective. Thus j is bijective, as required.
Lemma 3.2.4. Let p be an odd prime. For any finite -group A of order 2pm, we have #H1A = 2.

Proof. Let np denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups in A. By Sylow's Theorem we have np|2 and np  1 (mod p); see e.g. [Rotman1995, Theorem 4.12]. It follows that np = 1. Let P be the unique Sylow p-subgroup of A; it is normal and -invariant. We show by induction on m that the canonical map
H1A  H1 A/P
is bijective. Since A/P is a group of order 2, we have #H1A/P = 2, which will prove the lemma.
We proceed by d´evissage. If m = 0, there is nothing to prove. Assume that m  1.
Since P is a nontrivial p-group, it has nontrivial center; denote it by ZP and its order by pk, where k  1. Then ZP is a characteristic subgroup of P , and therefore, it is -invariant and normal in A. Consider the homomorphism of -groups A  A/ZP . Since ZP is a normal abelian -subgroup of A of odd order pk, by Lemma 3.2.3 the canonical map
H1A  H1 A/ZP
is bijective. We have # A/ZP = pl with l = m - k < m. By the induction hypothesis, the canonical map
H1 A/ZP  H1 A/P is bijective. Thus the canonical map
H1A  H1 A/P
is bijective, as required.
Lemma 3.2.5. Let p be an odd prime. For any finite -group A of order 2pm, there exists a -fixed element c of order 2.

Proof. Let S2 denote the set of subgroups H  A of order 2. Let n2 = #S2. By Sylow's Theorem n2 is odd.
The group  acts on S2. Since #S2 is odd,  has a fixed point in S2, say H = {1, c}. Then c is a -fixed element of order 2.
Lemma 3.2.6. With the assumptions and notation of Lemmas 3.2.4 and 3.2.5, let c  A be a -fixed element of order 2. Then c  Z1A and H1A = {[1], [c]}.

Proof. We have c · c = c2 = 1, and hence c  Z1A. Consider the canonical map
 : A  A/P.
Clearly, c / P , hence (c) = 1, and therefore, [c] = [1]  H1 A/P (we use the fact that A/P is a group of order 2). Thus H1 A/P = {[1], [c]}. By the proof of Lemma 3.2.4, the canonical map
 : H1A  H1 A/P is bijective. Thus H1A = {[1], [c]}, as required.

3.3. Galois cohomology of real algebraic groups.

3.3.1. Let G be a linear algebraic group over C. This means that we have a tuple (G, µ, , e), where G is an affine variety over C (not necessarily irreducible), where µ and  are morphisms and e is a C-point:

µ : G ×C G  G,  : G  G, e  G(C),
corresponding to multiplication, inversion, and to the neutral element in G, respectively. Certain diagrams containing these morphisms must commute; see, for instance, [Milne2017, 1.a, Definition 1.1]. See [Borel1966] for a few elementary definitions of a linear algebraic group. We write G(C) for the group of C-points of G; in the classical approach (see the books by Borel, Humphreys, and Springer titled "Linear Algebraic Groups") the C-group G is identified with G(C). The group G(C) is naturally a complex Lie group.
Let  : G(C)  G(C) be an anti-holomorphic involution of G(C), that is, an antiholomorphic group automorphism such that 2 = id. The automorphism  acts on holomorphic functions on G as follows:
(f )(x) = (f (-1(x))) for x  G(C),
where    denotes the complex conjugation (and of course -1 = .) Note that  acts on the constants by the complex conjugation .
Let C[G] denote the ring of regular functions on G. We say that an anti-holomorphic involution  of G(C) is anti-regular, if for any regular function f  C[G]), the function f is again regular.

Remark 3.3.2. In general, not all anti-holomorphic involutions of G(C) are anti-regular. However, if the identity component of G is reductive, then any anti-holomorphic involution is anti-regular; see [AT2018, Lemma 3.1].

3.3.3. Let G be a linear algebraic group over R, that is, we have a tuple (G, µ, , e), where G is an affine variety over R (not necessarily irreducible), µ and  are R-morphisms and e is an R-point:

(3.3.4)

µ : G ×R G  G,  : G  G, e  G(R),

that fit into the commutative diagrams of [Milne2017, 1.a, Definition 1.1]. We again refer to [Borel1966] for elementary definitions of a linear algebraic group over a nonclosed field. We write G(R) for the real Lie group of the R-points of G, and G(C) for the complex Lie group of the C-points of G.

Set G = GC := G ×R C.
Then the complex conjugation  naturally acts on G(C) = G(C) and thus defines an anti-regular involution  = G : G(C)  G(C). We obtain a functor

(3.3.5)

G (G, ).

Proposition 3.3.6 (well-known; see [Jahnel2000, Theorem 2.2(b)]). The functor (3.3.5) from the category of linear algebraic R-groups to the category of pairs (G, ), where G is a linear algebraic C-group and  : G(C)  G(C) is an anti-regular involution, is an equivalence of categories.

Idea of proof. It suffices to prove that the functor (3.3.5) is essentially surjective. We
start from a pair (G, ) and construct G. Now G is an affine algebraic group over C,
that is, we have a tuple (G, µ, , e) as in Subsection 3.3.1. We assume that G is a closed subvariety in the n-dimensional affine space AnC defined by an ideal I in the ring of polynomials C[X1, X2, . . . , Xn]. Then by definition, the C-algebra of regular functions C[G] is

26

MIKHAIL BOROVOI, WILLEM DE GRAAF, AND HO^ NG VA^ N LE^

C[X1, X2, . . . , Xn]/I. It has a finite set of generators x1, x2, . . . , xn over C, the images of X1, . . . , Xn in C[G].
The Galois group  = {1, } naturally acts on C[G] (namely,  acts by ). We consider A := C[G], the ring of fixed points of  in C[G]. Consider the set
  = {yk = xk + (xk), zk = -1(xk - (xk)) | k = 1, . . . , n}.
Then yk, zk  A, and  is a finite set of generators of A over R. We set G = Spec A, the spectrum of the ring A, that is, an affine variety G over R with algebra of regular functions R[G] = A. It is constructed as follows. We consider the algebra of polynomials B = R[Y1, Z1, Y2, Z2, . . . , Yn, Zn], and the surjective homomorphism
 : B  A defined by Yk  yk, Zk  zk .
Consider the ideal I = ker   B. We take for G the closed subvariety in the 2ndimensional affine space A2Rn defined by the ideal I. Then R[G] = B/I = A, as required.
We have R[G] R C = C[G], and hence, G ×R C = G. Since  is a group automorphism of G(C), the morphisms µ and  commute with the -action on G(C), and therefore, they are "defined over R", that is, they come from (unique) morphisms µ,  as in (3.3.4). Similarly, the C-point e comes from an R-point e. Then (G, µ, , e) is a desired affine algebraic group over R, as required.

3.3.7. From now on, by a linear algebraic group over R (for brevity: an R-group) we mean a pair M = (M, ), where M is a linear algebraic group over C, and  is an anti-regular involution of M (C). Then  naturally acts on M (C) (namely, the complex conjugation  acts as ). We set
M(C) := M (C), M(R) = M (C), H1(R, M) := H1(, M(C)).

For brevity we write H1 M for H1(R, M).

A homomorphism M  N of R-groups, where M = (M, M ) and N = (N, N ), is a homomorphism  : M  N such that the induced homomorphism M (C)  N (C) is
-equivariant, where  act as M on M (C), and as N on N (C). Such a homomorphism  induces a homomorphism
R : M(R)  N(R)

and a map

 : H1 M  H1 N.

Note that if M = (M, M ) and N = (N, N ) are isomorphic, then M and N are isomorphic.

Example 3.3.8. Let µ3,R denote the group of 3rd roots of unity in C× with the standard (nontrivial) action of the complex conjugation. Then µ3,R(R) = {1}, but µ3,R = 1, because #µ3,R(C) = 3.

Example 3.3.9. Consider the group SL9,R := (SL9,C, ), where  acts by complex conjugation of the matrix entries. We have a canonical embedding

µ3,R  SL9,R, x  xI, where I = diag(1, 1, . . . , 1).
We set G0 = SL9,R/µ3,R.
This means that G0 = SL9,C/µ3,C with the induced anti-regular automorphism of G0(C). Then G0 is not isomorphic to SL9,R, because G0 is not isomorphic to SL9,C (since G0 has center of order 3, while SL9,C has center of order 9). However, the canonical homomorphism
SL9,R  G0

induces an isomorphism of real Lie groups

see Corollary 3.3.14 below.

SL(9, R)  G0(R);

Lemma 3.3.10. Let H be an R-group, and let M  H be a finite abelian normal Rsubgroup of odd order, that is, the order of M is odd. (We do not assume that M is contained in the center of H). Then the canonical homomorphism on R-points

H(R)  (H/M)(R)

is surjective. In particular, if the topological group H(R) is connected, then the topological space (H/M)(R) is connected as well.

Proof. The short exact sequence of R-groups
1  M --i H --j H/M  1
gives rise to a cohomology exact sequence
1  M(R) -i-(R) H(R) -j-(R) (H/M)(R) -- H1 M.
By assumption the group M is of odd order. By Corollary 3.2.2 we have H1 M = {1}, and hence, the map j(R) : H(R)  (H/M)(R) is surjective, as required. If H(R) is connected, then its image (H/M)(R) = j(R)(H(R)) under the continuous map j(R) is connected, as required.
Corollary 3.3.11. Let H be a simply connected semisimple R-group, and G = H/M, where M  Z(H) is a finite central R-subgroup of odd order (that is, M is contained in the center of H and is of odd order). Then the group G(R) is connected.

Proof. Since H is simply connected, the group of R-points H(R) is connected; see [Borel-Tits1972, Corollary 4.7], or Gorbatsevich, Onishchik, and Vinberg [GOV1994, 4.2.2, Theorem 2.2], or Platonov and Rapinchuk [PR1994, Proposition 7.6 in Section 7.2 on page 407]. Since M is of odd order, by Lemma 3.3.10 the group of R-points G(R) is connected, as required.

Remark 3.3.12. The assertion of Corollary 3.3.11 becomes false if we do not assume that M is of odd order. For example, if we take G = PGL2,R = GL2,R/Gm,R = SL2,R/µ2, then G(R) = GL(2, R)/R× is not connected.

Lemma 3.3.13. Let H be an R-group, and let M be an abelian normal algebraic Rsubgroup of H (that is, M is an abelian normal -invariant algebraic subgroup of H). Assume that M is isomorphic over R to µn,R, where n is an odd natural number. Set G0 = H/M. Then the canonical epimorphism

j : H  G0

induces an isomorphism and a bijection

j(R) : H(R)  G0(R) j : H1 H  H1G0 .

Proof. We have ker j(R) = M(R)  µn(R) = {1} (because n is odd), hence the homomorphism j(R) is injective. Since M is of odd order, by Lemma 3.3.10 the homomorphism j(R)
is surjective. Thus j(R) : H(R)  G0(R) is bijective. Since M is of odd order, by Lemma 3.2.3 the map j : H1 H  H1G0 is bijective, which completes the proof.

Corollary 3.3.14. Set G0 = SL9,R/µ3 and consider the canonical homomorphism

j : SL9,R  G0 .

Then induced homomorphism on R-points

j(R) : SL(9, R)  G0(R) is an isomorphism, and H1G0 = 1.

Lemma 3.3.15. Let

G = GLn1,R × · · · × GLnk,R with n1 + · · · + nk = 9. We naturally embed G into GL9,R and set

Then H1 H = 1.

S = ker[G --d-et Gm,R], H = S/µ3 .

Proof. Since µ3(C) is of odd order 3, by Lemma 3.2.3 we have H1 H = H1(, S(C)/µ3(C)) = H1(, S(C)) = H1 S.
We have H1G = 1; see [Serre1979, X.1, Proposition 3]. From the short exact sequence

1  S  G  Gm,R  1

we obtain a cohomology exact sequence

G(R) -d-et R× -- H1S  H1G = 1,

whence

H1S = coker[G(R) -d-et R×] = 1.

Thus H1 H = 1, as required.

Proposition 3.3.16. Let B be an R-group and let B denote the identity component of B. Assume that

(1) B/B is a finite group of order pn for some odd prime p and some integer n  0; (2) #H1 B < p.

Then the canonical map H1 B  H1 B is bijective.

Proof. Write A = B, C = B/B. Let  : B  C denote the canonical epimorphism. We have a cohomology exact sequence
C(R)  H1A  H1B -- H1C,
where H1C = 1 because C is a group of order pn. We conclude that the map  : H1B  H1B is surjective. It remains to show that  is injective.
By Corollary 3.1.22 the map  identifies H1B with H1B/C(R) with respect to a certain action of C(R) on H1B. Since #C = pn, we see that #C(R) = pk for some natural number k. Since #H1B < p, we conclude that C(R) acts on H1B trivially. Thus the map  is injective, and hence bijective, which completes the proof.
Proposition 3.3.17. Let B be an R-group. Write A = B, C = B/B. Assume that
(1) H1A is trivial; (2) C is a finite group of order 2pn for some odd prime p and some integer n  0, (3) An element c of order 2 in C(R) (which exists because C is of order 2 · pn; see
Lemma 3.2.5) lifts to some cocycle b  Z1B; (4) H1 bA = 1.

Then #H1B = 2 with cocycles 1, b.

Proof. By Lemma 3.2.6 we have #H1C = 2 with cocycles 1, c. We have a short exact sequence
1  A --i B --j C  1.
By Corollary 3.1.22, the kernel of j : H1B  H1C comes from H1A. By assumption, H1A is trivial, and hence ker j = {[1]}. By assumption, [c] comes from [b] for some b  Z1B. Thus the fiber j-1[c] is not empty. By Corollary 3.1.23, this fiber is in a bijection with the quotient of H1bA by an action of the group (bC)(R). By assumption H1bA = 1, and hence j-1[c] = {[b]}. Thus H1B = {[1], [b]}, as required.

3.4. Weil restriction. Let G be linear algebraic C-group. We assume that G  GL(n, C). Consider the group
 G := {g | g  G}. Then  G is again a linear algebraic C-group in GL(n, C). Set
G = G ×  G

and define a map

 : G  G, (g1 , g2)  (g2 , g1).

It is easy to see that  is an anti-regular involution of G. In this way we obtain a linear

algebraic R-group

G = (G ×  G, ).

We have a map (3.4.1)

G(C)  G(R), g  (g, g).

It is easy to see that (3.4.1) is an isomorphism of real Lie groups. In other words, G(R)
is canonically isomorphic to the restriction of scalars (from C to R) of the complex Lie group G(C).

Definition 3.4.2. RC/R G = (G ×  G, ). It is called the Weil restriction (of scalars from C to R) of G.

Remark 3.4.3. Our construction of RC/R G does not depend on the embedding of G into GL(n, C). Indeed, one can obtain  G from G using the base change  : C  C; see [Borovoi2020, Sections 1.1 and 1.15] (where  G is denoted G).
Proposition 3.4.4 (well known). Let G be a linear algebraic C-group, and write G = RC/R G. Then:
(i) H1 G = {1}; (ii) if, moreover, G is abelian, then H2 G = {1}.

Proof. If z  Z1 G, then z = (g, g-1) for some g  G. Set h = (g, 1)  G; then z = h · (h)-1  1,
which proves (i). If G is abelian, then G is abelian as well. Let z  Z2 G; then z = (g, g) for some
g  G. Set h = (g, 1)  G; then
z = h · (h)  1,
which proves (ii).

Remark 3.4.5. Proposition 3.4.4 is a trivial special case of a lemma of D. K. Faddeev and Arnold Shapiro; see [Serre1997, I.5.8(b) and I.2.5, Corollary of Proposition 10].

3.5. Galois cohomology of real tori. As above, a real algebraic torus (for brevity: an R-torus) is a pair T = (T, T ), where T is a complex algebraic torus and T : T  T is an anti-regular involution.
Proposition 3.5.1 (well known, see, e.g., [Voskresenskii1998, Section 10.1]). Any R-torus is a product of tori isomorphic to one of these three indecomposable R-tori: R× , U (1), C.

Note that the real torus R× is also known as Gm,R, and the real torus C is also known as RC/RGm,C.
Definition 3.5.2. Let T = (T, T ) be a real torus. We write
XT = X(T ) = Hom(Gm,C, T )
(the cocharacter group). We define an involution T of XT by T (x(z)) = (T (x))(z) for x  XT , z  C×.

This corresponds to the formula

x(z) = x(z).

Construction 3.5.3. We define a homomorphism

We have

e : XT  T(C), x  x(-1).

T (e(x)) = T (x(-1)) = (T (x))(-1) = (T (x))(-1) = e(T (x)).
Thus the homomorphism e is -equivariant, where the complex conjugation    = Gal(C/R) acts on T (C) via T and on XT via T . For n = 1, 2 we obtain an induced homomorphism
e(n) : HnXT  Hn T.
Proposition 3.5.4. The homomorphism e(n) : HnXT  Hn T is an isomorphism.

Proof. It sufficed to prove the proposition for the three indecomposable tori of Proposition 3.5.1, which is easy.
Definition 3.5.5. By a -lattice we mean a finitely generated abelian group X with a -action. We say that X is a permutation lattice if it has a -stable basis. In other words, a permutation -lattice is a direct sum of -lattices isomorphic to Ztriv and Z2tw+ of Examples 3.1.6.
Proposition 3.5.6. Let X be a permutation -lattice. Then H1 X = 1.

Proof. The proposition follow immediately from Examples 3.1.6(1) and 3.1.6(5).
Definition 3.5.7. An R-torus T is called quasi-trivial if its cocharacter group XT is a permutation -module. In other word, T is quasi-trivial if and only if it is isomorphic to a direct product of tori of types C×st and (C×)2tw+ of Examples 3.1.7. Proposition 3.5.8 (Sansuc). Let T be a quasi-trivial R-torus. Then H1 T = 1 if and only if T is quasi-trivial.
Proof. If T is quasi-trivial, then by Proposition 3.5.6 we have H1 X(T) = 1, and by Proposition 3.5.4 we have H1 T = 1.
Conversely, suppose that H1 T = 1. We can write T as a direct product of indecomposable R-tori. Since H1 T = 1, this product does not contain direct factors isomorphic to U (1). It follows that T is quasi-trivial.

Remark 3.5.9. The "if" assertion of Proposition 3.5.8 is a special case of [Sansuc1981, formula (1.9.1)].

3.6. Using Galois cohomology for finding real orbits in homogeneous spaces.
3.6.1. Let G be a real algebraic group acting (over R) on a real algebraic variety Y. We write G = (G, ), Y = (Y, µ). Here µ is an anti-holomorphic involution of Y given by µ(y) = y. The assertion that G acts on Y over R means that G acts on Y by (g, y)  g · y, and this action is -equivariant: for g  G, y  Y we have
(g · y) = g · y, that is, µ(g · y) = (g) · µ(y).

We assume that G acts on Y transitively, that is, G acts on Y transitively.

3.6.2. We have G(R) = G, Y(R) = Y µ. The group G(R) naturally acts on Y(R), and this action might not be transitive. Assuming that Y(R) is nonempty, we describe the set of orbits Y(R)/G(R) in terms of Galois cohomology.
Let e  Y(R) = Y µ be an R-point. Let C = StabG(e). Since (e) = e, we have (C) = C. We consider the real algebraic subgroup

C = StabG(e) = (C, C ), where C = |C ,

and the homogeneous space G/C, on which  acts by (gC) = g ·C. We have a canonical

bijection

G/C  Y, gC  g · e,

and an easy calculation shows that this bijection is -equivariant. Taking into account

Proposition 3.1.15, we obtain bijections

(3.6.3)

ker[H1 C  H1 G]  (G/C)/G(R)  Y(R)/G(R).

Construction 3.6.4. We describe explicitly the composite bijection (3.6.3). Let c  Z1C be such that [c]  ker[H1 C  H1 G]. Then there exists g  G such that c = g-1 · g. We set ec = g · e  Y . We compute
µ(ec) = µ(g · e) = (g) · µ(e) = gc · e = g · (c · e) = g · e = ec .
Thus ec  Y(R). To c we associate the G(R)-orbit G(R) · ec  Y(R).

Proposition 3.6.5. The correspondence c  ec of Construction 3.6.4 induces a bijection ker[H1 C  H1 G]  Y(R)/G(R).

Proof. The proposition follows from Proposition 3.1.15.
3.6.6. Let G be a real algebraic group and let h  g := Lie G. Then G acts on g by the adjoint representation. Let Yh be the orbit of h, that is, the real algebraic variety defined by
Yh = {h  gC | h = Ad(g) · h for some g  G}, where gC = gR C. Let Zh denote the centralizer of h in G. The group G acts transitively on the left on Yh (that is, G acts transitively on Yh) by
(g, h)  Ad(g) · h, g  G, h  Yh
with stabilizer Zh of h.
Corollary 3.6.7 (from Proposition 3.6.5). The set of the G(R)-conjugacy classes in Yh(R) is in a canonical bijection with
ker[H1 Zh  H1 G].
Corollary 3.6.8. If H1 Zh = 1, then any element h  g that is conjugate to h over C, is conjugate to h over R.

3.7. Using real orbits for calculating Galois cohomology. We consider G = SU(m, n), the special unitary group of the Hermitian form Fm,n on V with matrix
Mm,n = diag(a1, . . . , am+n), where a1 = · · · = am = 1, am+1 = . . . , am+n = -1.
Here by abuse of notation we denote by SU(m, n) both the real algebraic group G and the group of real points G(R). Proposition 3.7.1 (well-known). H1 SU(m, n) is in a canonical bijections with the set
Sm,n = {k  Z | 0  k  m + n, k  m (mod 2)}
with explicit cocycles c(k) = diag(c(1k), . . . , c(mk+) n), where: (i) if k  m, then c(ik) = -1 for k < i  m, and 1 for the rest of i; (ii) if k > m, then c(ik) = -1 for m < i  k, and 1 for the rest of i.

Proof. Write r = m + n. Consider the set of Hermitian r × r-matrices M of determinant (-1)n. It is the set of R-points of a certain real algebraic variety Y. The real algebraic
group G = RC/RSL(r, C) acts on Y by

(3.7.2)

g : M  g · M · g t, where g  SL(r, C) = G(R), M  Y(R),

and this action extends to a polynomial action of G(C) on Y(C). One checks that the latter action is transitive. The stabilizer in G(R) of the matrix Mm,n  Y(R) is SU(m, n). Now by Proposition 3.6.5 we have a bijection
H1 SU(m, n) = ker[H1 SU(m, n)  H1 G] -- Y(R)/G(R),

where H1G = {1} by Proposition 3.4.4(i). Using the Hermitian version of Sylvester's law of inertia, we see that the Hermitian matrices Mk,m+n-k for k  Sm,n represent the orbits of G(R) = SL(r, C) in Y(R). Thus we know that #H1 SU(m, n) = #Sm,n. It remains to compute explicit cocycles.
It suffices to consider the case r = 1, c = -1. Then our matrix M = Mm,n is either M1,0 = 1 or M0,1 = -1. We embed G := RC/RC× into GL(2, R) by

a + bi 

ab -b a

= aI + bJ,

where I =

10 01

,

J=

01 -1 0

.

Then c = diag(-1, -1). According to Construction 3.6.4, we look for g  G(C) such that g-1 ·g = c = diag(-1, -1). We may take g = diag(i, i)  G(C)  GL(2, C). Then we have g t = g (sic!) in the sense of (3.7.2). Indeed, g = aI + bJ, where a = i, b = 0. Therefore, g = aI - bJ = aI + bJ = g, because b = 0. Thus g · M := g M g t = g2M = -M = cM .
Returning to the case of arbitrary m and n, we obtain that to c(k) we associate the orbit of c(k) Mm,n . The formulas for c(k) are written in such a way that

c(k) Mm,n = Mk,m+n-k for all k  Sm,n ,

which completes the proof.

Example 3.7.3. Let G = SU(1, 2). Then S1,2 = {1, 3}, whence #H1 G = 2. Our explicit cocycles are c(1) = diag(1, 1, 1) and c(3) = diag(1, -1, -1). Our representatives of orbits
are

c(1) · M1,2 = diag(1, -1, -1) = M1,2 and c(3) · M1,2 = diag(1, 1, 1) = M3,0 .

3.8. Using H2 for finding a real point in a complex orbit.

3.8.1. In order to use Construction 3.6.4, we need a real point. We describe a general method of finding a real point using second Galois cohomology, following an idea of Springer [Springer1966, Section 1.20]; see also [Borovoi1993, Section 7.7] and [DLA2019, Section 2]. We choose a C-point e  Y and set C = StabG(e)  G. In this article we consider only the special case when the complex algebraic group C is abelian; this suffices for our applications.
Consider µ(e)  Y . We have

e = g · µ(e) for some g  G, because Y is homogeneous. Since µ2 = id, we have
e = µ(µ(e)) = µ(g-1 · e) =(g-1) · µ(e) = (g-1) · g-1 · e = (g · (g))-1 · e.

Thus g · (g)  C. We set

d = g · (g)  C.

We define an anti-regular involution  of C. Let c  C. We calculate:

c · e = e  (c) · µ(e) = µ(e)  g · (c) · µ(e) = g · µ(e)   g (c)g-1 · g · µ(e) = g · µ(e)  g (c)g-1 · e = e.

We see that g (c)g-1  C. We set

(3.8.2)

(c) = g (c)g-1  C.

We compute 2(c) = ((c)) = g · ((c)) · g-1 = g · (g (c)g-1) · g-1 = (g (g)) · c · (g (g))-1 = c,

because g (g)  C and C is abelian. Thus 2 = 1, that is,  is an involution, and it is clear from (3.8.2) that it is anti-regular. We have
(d) = g (d)g-1 = g (g)g g-1 = g (g) = d. This d  C.
We have constructed an anti-regular involution  : C  C, c  g (c)g-1

and an element

d = g (g)  C.

3.8.3. We consider the real algebraic group C = (C, ). Recall that H2 C = Z2 C/B2 C,

where

Z2 C = C := {c  C | (c) = c}, B2 C = {c · (c) | c  C}.

We define the class of Y

Cl(Y ) = [d]  H2 C.

Lemma 3.8.4. The real algebraic group C = (C, ) and the cohomology class Cl(Y )  H2 C do not depend on the choices of e  Y and g  G (up to a canonical automorphism).

34

MIKHAIL BOROVOI, WILLEM DE GRAAF, AND HO^ NG VA^ N LE^

Proof. We check that C = (C, ) and Cl(Y )  H2 C do not depend on the choice of g  G. Recall that we have chosen g such that

e = g · µ(e).

If g  G is another element such that e = g · µ(e),

then g = cg for some c  C. For any c1  C, we obtain (c1) := g (c1)(g)-1 = cg (c1)g-1c-1 = c (c1)c-1 = (c1),

because the group C is abelian. We have

(3.8.5)

d := g (g) = cg (cg) =cg (c)(g) =c · g (c)g-1 · g (g) = c · (c) · d.

It follows that

[d] = [d]  H2 C.

Now we check that C = (C, ) and Cl(Y )  H2 C do not depend on the choice of e  Y . Let e  Y be another point. Choose h  G such that e = h · e. Write C = ZG(e). We have an isomorphism
 : C  C, c  hch-1,
Since the group C is abelian, the isomorphism  does not depend on the choice of h.

We have

µ(e) = (h) · µ(e) = (h) · g-1 · e = (h)g-1h-1 · e.

We set g = hg (h)-1; then

µ(e) = (g)-1 · e.

For c  C we set

(c) = g (c) (g)-1 = hg(h)-1 · (c) · (h)g-1h-1.

We obtain

((c)) =hg (h-1) · (hch-1) · (h)g-1h-1 =hg(c)g-1h-1 = h(c)h-1 = ((c)).

Thus  is an isomorphism of real algebraic groups  : (C, )  (C, )

and induces an isomorphism on H2  : H2 C  H2 C.

Set Then

d = g(g)  C. d := g(g) = hg (h-1) · (hg (h-1)) = hg (g)h-1 = (g (g)) = (d).

It follows that

[d] = [d],

as required. We conclude that the real algebraic group C = (C, ) and the cohomology class Cl(Y )  H2 C indeed do not depend on the choices made (up to a canonical

isomorphism).

Proposition 3.8.6. If Y has a µ-fixed point, then Cl(Y ) = 1.

TRIVECTORS IN R9

35

Proof. Assume that Y has a µ-fixed point y, that is, y = µ(y). Since Cl(Y ) does not depend on the choices of e and g, we may take e = y and g = 1. We obtain d = g · (g) = 1 and Cl(Y ) = [1] = 1, as required.
Proposition 3.8.7. If Cl(Y ) = 1 and H1 G = 1, then Y has a µ-fixed point.

Proof. Choose e  Y and g  G such that e = g · µ(e). Write d = g · (g)  Z2(R, C) = C.
By assumption [d] = 1, that is,
c · (c) · d = 1 for some c  C. Set g = cg. By (3.8.5) we have
g · (g) = c · (c) · d = 1. Thus g is a 1-cocycle, g  Z1G.
By assumption H1G = 1. It follows that there exists u  G such that u-1 g(u) = 1.
Set y = u-1 · e  Y . Then µ(y) = (u-1) · µ(e) = (u)-1g-1 · e = (u)-1g-1 · c-1 · e = (u)-1(g)-1 · e = (u)-1(g)-1u · y = u-1g (u) -1 · y = y.
Thus y is a µ-fixed point in Y , as required.
Remark 3.8.8. The proof of Proposition 3.8.7 gives an algorithm of finding a real (that is, µ-fixed) point in Y or proving that there is no such point, assuming that C is abelian and H1G = 1.
Remark 3.8.9. If we do not assume that C is abelian, then a homogeneous space Y of G defines an R-kernel  for C and a cohomology class Cl(Y )  H2(C, ). The second nonabelian cohomology set H2(C, ) has a distinguished subset of neutral elements N2(C, ), which may have more than one element. See [Springer1966, Section 1.20], or [Borovoi1993, Section 7.7], or [DLA2019, Section 2] for details. As above, one can show that if Y has a real point, then Cl(Y ) is neutral. Conversely, if Cl(Y ) is neutral and H1G = 1, then Y has a real point. The proofs of these assertions give an algorithm of finding a real point of Y or proving that Y has no real points (in the case when H1G = 1).

4. Semisimple and nilpotent elements in real semisimple Zm-graded Lie algebras
In this section we first compile and prove some important properties of Zm-graded semisimple Lie algebras g over a field k of characteristic 0 (Proposition 4.2.1, Theorem 4.3.5). We focus mainly on the case k = C or k = R and consider the -group of Zm-graded semisimple Lie algebras g over k = C or k = R (Remark 4.1.2). The action of the -group defines an equivalence relation on g1 and on the set of Cartan subspaces in g1. For k = R, we describe the equivalence classes of homogeneous nilpotent elements and the equivalence classes of Cartan subspaces in g1  g in terms of Galois cohomology and the structure of the associated objects in the complexified Zm-graded Lie algebra gC := g R C (Theorems 4.3.8, 4.4.9). We give a Levi decomposition of the centralizer ZG0(e) of a homogeneous nilpotent element e in a complex Zm-graded semisimple Lie algebra gC (Theorem 4.3.16). As a consequence, we give a Levi decomposition of the stabilizer algebra of a homogeneous mixed element in a complex semisimple Lie algebra gC (Theorem 4.6.3). We then study the conjugacy of semisimple elements in a fixed Cartan subspace (Section 4.5) using the

36

MIKHAIL BOROVOI, WILLEM DE GRAAF, AND HO^ NG VA^ N LE^

Weyl group of the graded Lie algebra. We derive a number of results that will be used in Section 7 for the classification of the real semisimple elements. Finally we describe the equivalence classes of homogeneous elements in terms of the equivalence classes of its semisimple and nilpotent parts in the Jordan decomposition (Proposition 4.6.2).

Conversely, any automorphism   Aut(gC) such that m = id

defines a Zm-grading on gC where gCk is the eigen-subspace corresponding to the eigenvalue

k of the action of . When m = , we define   Aut gC by the formula (4.1.1) with

 = 2. Vice versa, if  is a semisimple automorphism of gC with eigenvalues in the

multiplicative group generated by 2  C, we can define a Z-grading from .

Let G = (G, ~) denote the connected simply connected real algebraic group with Lie
algebra gC. Then the automorphism  of g that defines the Zm-grading on g can be lifted
uniquely to an automorphism  of G. Let G0 denote the algebraic subgroup of fixed
points of  in G. Then clearly Lie G0 = gC0. The automorphism  of g is semisimple, and by [Steinberg1968, Theorem 8.1] the complex reductive group G0 is connected. (We can also apply a result by Rashevski on the connectedness of the subgroup of fixed points of
an automorphism  of a simply connected Lie group G, providing that  is of compact type, i.e. for any g  G the set {ng| n  Z} is relatively compact in G [Rashevski1974,
Theorem A]). Since the Lie subalgebra gC0 is defined over R, and G0 is connected, we see that G0 is defined over R, that is, ~-stable. We write G0 = (G0, 0) for the corresponding R-group, where 0 is the restriction of ~.

Note that the restriction of the adjoint action of G on g to G0 preserves the Zm-

gradation on g (because the similar assertion is true for g0 , and G0 is connected). Let k

denote the corresponding action of G0 on gk. We wish to classify the G0(R)-orbits in gk.

If k = 1, then following [Vinberg1976], we can consider a new Zm¯ -graded Lie algebra ¯g,

m¯

m (m,k)

the

as the action of G0 on ¯g1. Thus in what follows we consider the G0(R)-orbits in g1 under

the action 1.

Remark 4.1.2. (1) Since 1(G0)  Aut(gC1) is the g1-component of the restriction of the adjoint group of gC to the connected subgroup whose Lie algebra is gC0, we can replace G (resp. G0) by any connected Lie group G having the Lie algebra gC (resp. the connected Lie subgroup in G whose Lie algebra is gC0) and we still have the same action 1(G0) on gC1, which is called the -group action of the underlying Zm-graded semisimple Lie algebra. The orbits of the -group action define an equivalence relation in gC1 (resp. of g1). If we want to use the corresponding automorphism  of G whose differential is , we can
consider both the simply connected group G and the adjoint group Adg = G/Z(G), since
(Z(G)) = Z(G).

(2) Let us consider a Zm-graded semisimple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 0. As in the case k = C, which was considered first by Vin-
berg [Vinberg1975, Vinberg1976], if m < , the Zm-grading is defined uniquely by the automorphism   Aut(g) defined in (4.1.1) If m =  then the formula

t(x) := tkx for x  gk

defines a 1-parameter group of automorphisms of g.

Thus we shall use the notation (g, ) for a Zm-graded semisimple Lie algebra g over a field k of characteristic 0, where k is the algebraic closure of k, and  is the automorphism of the Lie algebra g := g k k that defines the induced Zm-grading on g as follows

g k k =

gi k k.

iZm

If  is the identity, then we may omit  and say that g is ungraded.

(3) As it has been noted in [Vinberg1976], results for Zm-graded semisimple complex Lie algebras are easily extended to Zm-graded algebraic reductive complex Lie algebras. Similarly, results for Zm-graded semisimple real Lie algebras are easily extended to Zmgraded algebraic reductive real Lie algebras. For the sake of simplicity of the exposition,
we shall consider mainly Zm-graded semisimple Lie algebras in our paper, and we shall explicitly extend results for Zm-graded semisimple Lie algebras to Zm-graded algebraic reductive Lie algebras only when it is necessary. Finally we refer the reader to [Kac1995]
for relations between Zm-graded complex semisimple Lie algebras and the Kac-Moody Lie algebras.

4.2. Jordan decomposition of homogeneous elements. In this subsection we prove the graded version of the Jordan decomposition of a homogeneous element in a Zm-graded semisimple Lie algebra g over a field k of characteristic zero, extending Vinberg's result for the case k = C [Vinberg1976, §1.4] and L^e's result for the case k = R [Le2011, §2].
Proposition 4.2.1. Let x  g1 be a homogeneous element in a Zm-graded semisimple Lie algebra g over a field k of characteristic 0. Then x = xs + xn, where xs  g1 is a semisimple element, xn  g1 is a nilpotent element and [xs, xn] = 0.
Proof. Since g is semisimple, we have the Jordan decomposition x = xs + xn, see e.g. [Humphreys1980, p. 17, 18]. Recall that k denotes the algebraic closure of k. Then the Zm-grading on g extends naturally to a Zm-grading on g k k, which is defined by an automorphism   Aut(g k k), see Remark 4.1.2 (2). Then we have
(x) =  · x =  · (xs + xn).
Since the Jordan decomposition is unique, it follows that xs  g1 and xn  g1. This completes the proof of Proposition 4.2.1.

4.3. Homogeneous sl2-triples and nilpotent elements. Let g be a Lie algebra over a field k of characteristic 0. Recall that a triple (h, e, f ) of elements in g is called an sl2-triple, if e and f are nilpotent, h is semisimple, and
[e, f ] = h, [h, e] = 2e, [h, f ] = -2f.
Now assume further that g is Zm-graded. We say that an sl2-triple (h, e, f ) is homogeneous if h  g0, e  g1, f  g-1. From now on by an sl2-triple we mean a homogeneous sl2-triple.
Lemma 4.3.1. Let (h, e, f ) and (h, e, f ) be sl2-triples in a Lie algebra over a field of characteristic 0. Then f = f .

Proof. This is [TY2005, Lemma 32.2.3].

Lemma 4.3.2. Let g = iZmgi be a Zm-graded semisimple Lie algebra over a field of characteristic 0. Let e  g1 be nilpotent. Then there exist f  g-1 and h  g0 such that
(h, e, f ) is an sl2-triple.

Proof. This is proved in the same way as [KR1971, Proposition 4] (in the cited paper Z2-gradings are considered, but the same ideas work more generally, see also [Graaf2017], Lemma 8.3.5).
Lemma 4.3.3. Let g = iZmgi be a Zm-graded semisimple Lie algebra over a field of characteristic 0. Let (h, e, f ), (h, e, f ) be two homogeneous sl2-triples. Then there is a nilpotent element z  g0 such that, setting  = exp(ad z), we have (h) = h, (e) = e and (f ) = f .

Proof. The proof is similar to the proof of [TY2005, Lemma 32.2.6]; in this book the assumption is that the field is algebraically closed. However, for the proof of this lemma that assumption plays no role. See also [Graaf2017], the proof of Theorem 8.3.6.
Definition 4.3.4. Given a sl2-triple (h, e, f ) we call h the characteristic of the nilpotent element e.
Lemma 4.3.3 implies that if e and e are G0-conjugate, then their characteristics are G0-conjugate. If the ground field k is C then the converse is also true [Vinberg1979, Theorem 1(4)].
Theorem 4.3.5. Let g = iZmgi be a Zm-graded semisimple Lie algebra over a field of characteristic 0. Let H be a group of automorphisms of g such that each element of H stabilizes each space gi. Assume that H contains exp(ad z) for all nilpotent z  g0. Let e, e  g1 be nilpotent elements lying in homogeneous sl2-triples (h, e, f ), (h, e, f ). Then e, e are H-conjugate if and only if there exists   H with (h) = h, (e) = e, (f ) = f  (in other words, the two sl2-triples are H-conjugate).
Proof. Of course only one direction needs a proof. Let 1  H be such that 1(e) = e. By Lemma 4.3.3 there exists 2  H with 2(1(h)) = h, 2(e) = e, 2(1(f )) = f  so we can set  = 21.

Now let g be a Zm-graded semisimple Lie algebra over R. Let T C, T be the sets of homogeneous sl2-triples in gC and g, respectively. If we let  denote the complex conjugation of gC with respect to a basis of g, then T = {t  T C | (t) = t}.
Lemma 4.3.6. Let h  Mn(R) be a semisimple matrix whose all eigenvalues 1, . . . , k are real, where 1, . . . , k are pairwise different. Then the centralizer ZSL(n,R)(h) of h in SL(n, R) is conjugate over R to S(GL(n1, R) × · · · × GL(nk, R)), which is the subgroup consisting of all matrices of determinant 1 that are block diagonal with blocks of respective sizes n1, . . . , nk, where ni are the multiplicities of the eigenvalue of i ,, and hence n1 + · · · + nk = n.

Proof. Lemma 4.3.6 is known to experts, see e.g. [Le1998, Table A.3, Appendix A] for a
similar assertion and [Djokovi´c1983, p. 20] for the case n = 8. For the sake of reader's convenience we give here a short proof of this Lemma. For i = 1, . . . , k, let Vi  V := Rn denote the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue i. By the definition of a semisimple matrix, V = Vi (we take into account that the real numbers 1, . . . , k are all complex eigenvalues of h). Hence the centralizer of h in GL(n, R) = GL(V ) is GL(Vi), the centralizer of h in SL(V ) is S ( GL(Vi)), and the lemma follows.

Lemma 4.3.7. Let e  g1 be a nilpotent element contained in a homogeneous sl2-triple (h, e, f ). Let e  G0(e)g1; then e is G0(R)-conjugate to some e lying in a homogeneous sl2-triple (h, e, f ).

Proof. We present two proofs of this Lemma. In the first proof we use [Le2011, Lemma 4.1 (ii)], which asserts that if (h, e, f )  g1 is a homogeneous sl2-triple then AdG0(h)  g0 = AdG0(R)(h). Now let e  G0(e)  g1 and (h, e, f ) is a homogeneous sl2-triple. Then h  G0(h)g1 and by [Le2011, Lemma 4.1.(ii)] we have h = Adg0 (h) for some g0  G0(R). Let e = Ad-g01(e). Then (h, e, f ) is the required homogeneous sl2-triple.
In the second proof of Lemma 4.3.7 we use a result from Galois cohomology theory. For the Z/3Z-graded Lie algebra e8(8) that we consider in this paper, we argue as follows. Let (h, e, f ) be a homogeneous sl2-triple containing e. Then h and h are G0-conjugate by Theorem 4.3.5.

Since h fits into an sl2-triple, all its eigenvalues of the adjoint action on g and hence on g0 = sl(9, R) (see [VE1978] and Section 5) are integral. Let  = a + bi be an eigenvalue of h on C9. Since h is real, the complex conjugate number ¯ = a - bi is an eigenvalue as well. Then the eigenvalue  - ¯ = 2bi on g0 is integral, whence b = 0. We conclude that all eigenvalues of h on C9 are real.

By Lemma 4.3.6 the centralizer ZG0(h) is isomorphic to S(GL(n1, R) × · · · × GL(nk, R))
and hence it has trivial Galois cohomology by Lemma 3.3.15. So by Corollary 3.6.8 there is a g  G0(R) with g · h = h. Hence if we set e = g · e, f  = g · f , then we see that (h, e, f ) is G0(R)-conjugate to (h, e, f ).

Theorem 4.3.8. Let e  g1 be a nilpotent element and t = (h, e, f ) be a homogeneous sl2-triple.

(1) The set of G0(R)-orbits in G0(e)  g1 is in a canonical bijection with

(4.3.9)

ker[H1ZG0 (t)  H1G0 ].

(2) The set of G0(R)-orbits in G0(e)  g1 is in a canonical bijection with

(4.3.10)

ker[H1ZG0 (t)  H1ZG0(h)],

where h is the semisimple element in the sl2-triple t = (h, e, f ).

Proof. By Theorem 4.3.5, the G0(R)-orbits of nilpotent elements in g1 are in a canonical bijection with the G0(R)-orbits in T . By Proposition 3.6.5, the set of G0(R)-orbits in T is in a canonical bijection with the kernel (4.3.9), and the first assertion of Theorem 4.3.8 follows.
For the second part we note that by Lemma 4.3.7 each G0(R)-orbit in G0(e)  g1 has a representative e lying in a homogeneous sl2-triple (h, e, f ) (with e  g1, f  g-1). Consider the set
ThC = { homogeneous sl2-triples (h, e, f ) with e  gC1, f   gC-1}.
Then by Theorem 4.3.5 the G0(R)-orbits in G0(e) are in a canonical bijection with the G0(R)-conjugacy classes in the set Th consisting of homogeneous sl2-triples (h, e, f ) with this h and with e  g1, f   g-1. It is obvious that two elements of ThC are G0-conjugate if and only if they are ZG0(h)-conjugate. Furthermore, two complex homogeneous sl2triples (h1, e1, f1), (h2, e2, f2) are G0-conjugate if and only if h1, h2 are G0-conjugate by [Vinberg1979, Theorem 1.4], see also [Graaf2017, Theorem 8.3.6]. Hence ThC is a single ZG0(h)-orbit. Now the assertion of (2) follows from Proposition 3.6.5.

Remark 4.3.11. (1) Lemma 4.3.2 extends Jacobson-Morozov's result concerning sl2triples in ungraded Lie algebras over a field k of characteristic 0 [Jacobson1962, Lemma 7 and Theorem 17, Chapter III], see also [CM1993] for the case k = C or k = R, Vinberg's result for homogeneous sl2-triples in graded Lie algebras over C [Vinberg1979, Theorem 1] and L^e's result [Le2011, Theorem 2.1] for homogeneous sl2-triples in graded Lie algebras over R.
(2) Lemma 4.3.3 and Theorem 4.3.5 extend Kostant's result for ungraded complex simple Lie algebras [Kostant1959], Vinberg's result for graded Lie algebras over C [Vinberg1979, Theorem 1] and L^e's result for graded Lie algebras over R [Le2011, Theorem 1.2].
(3) Theorem 4.3.8 (2) extends Djokovi´c's result that Dojokovi´c used for his classification of 3-vectors on R8 [Djokovi´c1983]. There is another proof of Theorem 4.3.8 (2) that employs [Le2011, Theorem 4.3], which also served for L^e's method for a classification of conjugacy classes of homogeneous nilpotent elements in a real Zm-graded semisimple Lie algebra using algorithms in real algebraic geometry. Note that the latter method is very hard to implement.
(4) It is known that an element x  g1 (resp. x  gC1) is nilpotent if and only if the closure of its orbit G0(R) · x (resp. the closure of its orbit G0 · x) contains zero [Le2011, Lemma 2.5] (resp. [Vinberg1976, Proposition 1]), and x is semisimple if and only if the orbit G0(R) · x (resp. the orbit G0 · x) is closed [Le2011, Lemma 2.5](resp. [Vinberg1976, Proposition 3]).

In Theorem 4.3.16 below we shall describe a Levi-decomposition of the stabiliser ZG0(e), generalizing a result due to Barbasch-Vogan and Kostant, see [CM1993, Lemma 3.7.3, p. 50], and combining it with Galois cohomology technique (Proposition 4.3.19) we shall give a new proof of Theorem 4.3.8 (1).
Let t = (h, e, f ) be a homogeneous sl2-triple in a Zm-graded semisimple complex Lie algebra g.

Lemma 4.3.12. Zg0(t) is a reductive Levi subalgebra of the algebraic Lie algebra Zg0(e) and we have the following decomposition

(4.3.13)

Zg0 (e) = (Zg0 (e)  [g, e])  Zg0 (t).

Proof. Let  be the automorphism of g that defines the Zm-grading. Since e is an eigenvector of , it follows that Zg(e) is invariant under the action of . Hence we have the following decomposition

(4.3.14)

Zg(e) = (Zg(e)  gi).
iZm

By Barbasch-Vogan's and Kostant's result [CM1993, Lemma 3.7.3, p. 50] we have

(4.3.15)

Zg(e) = (Zg(e)  [g, e])  Zg(t).

Since each summand in RHS of (4.3.15) is invariant under the action of , we obtain (4.3.13) immediately.

Next we observe that Zg0(t) is a reductive subalgebra of Zg0(e) since Zg(t) and g0 are reductive Lie subalgebra. Since Zg(e)  [g, e] is a nilpotent ideal of Zg(e) by [CM1993,
Lemma 3.7.3, p. 50], Zg0(e)  [g, e] is a nilpotent ideal of Zg0(e). Hence Zg0(t) is the Levi reductive subalgebra of Zg0 (e). This completes the proof of Lemma 4.3.12.

Theorem 4.3.16. Let Ru ZG0(e) denote the unipotent radical of the identity component of ZG0 (e). Then Ru ZG0 (e) · ZG0(t) = ZG0 (e).

TRIVECTORS IN R9

Proof. Denote by U e the connected Lie subgroup in the adjoint group Adg of the Lie algebra g corresponding to the Lie subalgebra Zg(e)  [g, e]. By [CM1993, Lemma 3.7.3, p. 50], we have the Levi decomposition

(4.3.17)

ZAdg(e) = U e · ZAdg(t).

Recall that G0 is the connected Lie subgroup of Adg corresponding to the Lie algebra g0. Denote by  the automorphism of the adjoint group Adg whose differential is , namely we set

(4.3.18)

(Adexp ) := Adexp(())

for any   g, see Remark 4.1.2(1). Since U e and Zg(e) are invariant under , taking into account that the map exp : Zg(e)  [g, e]  U e is a diffeomorphism, we obtain from (4.3.17) and (4.3.18):
ZG0 (e) = (U e  ZG0 0(e)) · ZG0 (t).
Noting that U e  ZG0 0(e) = Ru ZG0(e), this completes the proof of Theorem 4.3.16.

Proposition 4.3.19. The natural map

H1(k, ZG0 (t)) --i- H1(k, ZG0 (e)) induced by the inclusion map i : ZG0(t)  ZG0(e) is bijective.

For the proof of Proposition 4.3.19 we need Sansuc's lemma.

Proposition 4.3.20 ([Sansuc1981], Lemma 1.13). Let G be a linear algebraic group over
a field k of characteristic 0, and let U  G be a unipotent k-subgroup. Assume that U is normal in G. Then the canonical map H1(k, G)  H1(k, G/U ) is bijective.

Sansuc assumes that G is connected, but his concise proof does not use this assumption. See [BDR2018, Proposition 3.1] for a detailed proof.

Proof of Proposition 4.3.19. Since Ru ZG0(e) is a normal unipotent subgroup of ZG0(e), we see that Ru ZG0(e)  ZG0(t) is a normal unipotent subgroup of the reductive group ZG0(e, h, f ), and hence equals {1}. Since Ru ZG0(e) · ZG0 (t) = ZG0(e) by Theorem 4.3.16, we see that the composite map
ZG0(t) --i C(e) --j ZG0 (e)/Ru ZG0(e)
is bijective. Thus the composite map
H1(k, ZG0 (t)) --i H1(k, ZG0 (e)) --j H1(k, ZG0 (e)/Ru ZG0 (e))
is bijective.
Since by Sansuc's lemma (Proposition 4.3.20) the map j is bijective, so is the map i , as required.

Alternative proof of Theorem 4.3.8(1). Combining Proposition 3.6.5 with Proposition 4.3.19, we obtain immediately Theorem 4.3.8(1).

Finally we show the existence of a real representative of nilpotent orbits under a certain assumption.
Proposition 4.3.21. (cf. [Djokovi´c1982, Lemmas 6.3, 6.5]) Assume that a Zm-graded real semisimple Lie algebra g is split, i.e. g is the split form of gC. Then every complex orbit G0(e) of a homogeneous nilpotent element e  gC1 has a real representative in g1.

Proof. Let e  gC1 be a nilpotent element lying in the homogeneous sl2-triple (h, e, f ). The adjoint map ad h : gC  gC has integral eigenvalues. This implies that h  g. Now for i, k  Z define gCi (k) = {u  gCi | [h, u] = ku} and
U = {u  gC1(2) | [gC0(0), u] = gC1(2)}
then U is open in gC1(2) ([Graaf2017, Proposition 8.4.1]) and nonempty as e  U . Since h  g all spaces involved have bases consisting of elements of g. So U  g1 is nonempty; let e be an element of it. Then e lies in a homogeneous sl2-triple (h, e, f ) (again by [Graaf2017, Proposition 8.4.1]). As the first element of this triple is the same as the first element of the triple containing e we have that e and e are G0-conjugate ([Graaf2017, Theorem 8.3.6]).

4.4. Cartan subspaces in graded semisimple Lie algebras over R. In this subsec-
tion we consider a graded semisimple real Lie algebra g = iZmgi. Recall that a Cartan subspace in g1 is a maximal subspace in g1 consisting of commuting semisimple elements (cf. [Vinberg1976] and [Le2011, §2]). Two Cartan subspaces h and h in g1 are called conjugate if there exists an element g  G0(R) such that g · h = h.

For any subspace V in g we use the shorthand notation V C for V R C  gC.

Recall that we denote by zg(V ) the centralizer of V in g. Set

(4.4.1)

zg(V )i := zg(V )  gi.

Lemma 4.4.2. Let h  g1 be a subspace consisting of commuting semisimple elements. Then zg(h) is an algebraic reductive Lie subalgebra of maximal rank. Moreover, we have

(4.4.3)

zg(h) = zg(h)i.
i

Denote by Z(zg(h)) the center of zg(h) and by D(zg(h)) the derived algebra (the commutator subalgebra) of zg(h). Then

(4.4.4)

zg(h)i = (Z(zg(h))  gi)  (D(zg(h))  gi).

Proof. The first assertion of Lemma 4.4.2 is well-known. It is an easy consequence of the fact that the centralizer of any set of commuting semisimple elements in a complex algebraic reductive Lie algebra is an algebraic reductive Lie algebra of maximal rank, see e.g. [Vinberg1976, §2.2].

Now let us prove the second assertion of Lemma 4.4.2. For any g  zg(h) write g = i gi, where gi  gi. Since [g, t] = 0 for any t  h, it follows that [gi, t]  gi+1 must vanish. This proves (4.4.3).

Since D(zg(h)) = [zg(h), zg(h)], using (4.4.3) we obtain that

(4.4.5)

D(zg(h)) = iD(zg(h))  gi.

Since zg(h) R C = zgC(h) is invariant under the action of , we have

(4.4.6)

Z(zg(h)) = iZ(zg(h))  gi.

Combining (4.4.6) with (4.4.3) and (4.4.5), taking into account that zg(h) is a reductive Lie subalgebra, we obtain (4.4.4) immediately. This proves Lemma 4.4.2.

We set Z(zg(h))i := Z(zg(h))  gi, and D(zg(h))i := D(zg(h))  gi. The following lemma is a version of [Vinberg1976, Prop. 6] for real Zm-graded semisimple Lie algebras.
Lemma 4.4.7. A subspace h consisting of commuting semisimple elements in g1 is a Cartan subspace if and only if Z(zg(h))1 = h and D(zg(h))1 consists of nilpotent elements.

TRIVECTORS IN R9

43

Proof. Assume that h is a Cartan subspace. Then Z(zg(h))1 = h, since h  Z(zg(h))1. Now we wish to show that D(zg(h))1 contains only nilpotent elements. Let v  D(zg(h))1. We will show that v is nilpotent. The grading in g induces a grading in D(zg(h)); see (4.4.5). We write the Jordan decomposition v = s + n in the real semisimple Lie algebra D(zg(h)), where s  D(zg(h))1 is semisimple and n  D(zg(h))1 is nilpotent; see Subsection 4.2. Then s  D(zg(h))  zg(h). It follows that s commutes with h. Since s is semisimple and s  g1, we conclude that s  h = Z(zg(h))1. On the other hand, s is contained in D(zg(h))1. Since
Z(zg(h))1  D(zg(h))1  Z(zg(h))  D(zg(h)) = {0},
we conclude that s = 0 and v = n is nilpotent, which proves the "only" part of Lemma 4.4.7. Now we assume that Z(zg(h))1 = h and D(zg(h))1 consists of nilpotent elements. Then any subspace t  h consisting of commuting semisimple elements in g1 lies in Z(zg(h))1, so t = h. This proves Lemma 4.4.7.
Corollary 4.4.8. The complexification of a real Cartan subspace h  g1 is a complex Cartan subspace in gC. Furthermore, if the complexification hC of a subspace h  g1 is a Cartan subspace in gC1 then h is a Cartan subspace.
Proof. Assume that h  g1 is a Cartan subspace. By Lemma 4.4.7, D(zg1(h))  gl(g) consists of nilpotent elements. By [Humphreys1980, Corollary 3.3] (a version of Engel's theorem), since the Lie subalgebra D(zg1(h))  gl(g) consists of nilpotent elements, its complexification D(zgC1 (hC))  gl(gC) consists of nilpotent elements. Next we note that Z(zgC (hC))1 = hC, since Z(zg(h))1 = h by Lemma 4.4.7. By [Vinberg1976, Proposition 6], it follows that hC is a Cartan subspace in gC1. This proves the first assertion of Corollary 4.4.8.
It follows from the first assertion that all Cartan subspaces in g1 have the same dimension, which is the dimension of any Cartan subspace in gC1. Now assume that hC is a Cartan subspace. Then h consists of commuting semisimple elements and dimR h = dimC hC. Hence h is a real Cartan subspace in g1. This completes the proof of Corollary 4.4.8.
In Theorem 4.4.9 below we establish a canonical bijection between the conjugacy classes of Cartan subspaces in g1 and a subgroup of Galois cohomology, using Proposition 3.1.15. Let h be a Cartan subspace in g1. By Corollary 4.4.8, hC is a Cartan subspace in gC1. We denote N0 = NG0(hC).
Theorem 4.4.9. There is a canonical bijection between the conjugacy classes of Cartan subspaces in g1 and the kernel ker[H1N0  H1G0 ].
Proof. Let d denote the dimension of a Cartan subspace in gC1. Then the set Y of Cartan subspaces in gC1 is a closed algebraic subvariety in the Grassmann variety Gr(gC1, d) of ddimensional linear subspaces in gC1. This subvariety is defined over R (with respect to the R-structure in gC1), because the composition law in gC is defined over R. Let Y denote the corresponding real variety. By Vinberg's theorem [Vinberg1976, Theorem 1], the variety Y is homogeneous, that is, G0 acts on Y transitively. By Corollary 4.4.8, a real subspace h  g1 is a real Cartan subspace if and only if its complexification hC is a complex Cartan subspace in gC1. In other words, the set of real Cartan subspaces of g1 is the set of real points Y(R) of Y. Now Theorem 4.4.9 follows from Proposition 3.6.5.

It is known that any Zm-graded complex semisimple Lie algebra has a compact real form g [Helgason1978, Lemma 5.2, p. 491].
Proposition 4.4.10. All Cartan subspaces in g1 are G0(R)-conjugate, if the simplyconnected Lie group G(R) is compact.

Proof. We shall apply the argument in the proof of the conjugacy of maximal tori in a compact Lie group in [OV1990, p. 250] to the algebraic closure hC of a Cartan subspace hC  gC1 in a Zm-graded semisimple complex Lie algebra gC. Recall that hC is the smallest algebraic subalgebra of gC that contains hC. In [Vinberg1976, §3] Vinberg showed that

(4.4.11)

hC =

(hC)k, where (hC)k = hC  gCk.

(k,m)=1

Let  be the automorphism of the Lie algebra gC that defines the Zm-grading on gC. Clearly hC is -invariant.

Now let us assume the condition of Proposition 4.4.10. Let h  g1 be a Cartan subspace and hC the algebraic closure of its complexification. Let h := hC  g. Note that hC is the

Lie algebra of a maximal -invariant torus T in G and h is the Lie algebra of its maximal

compact torus Tc. Now let h  g1 be another Cartan subspace, and T  - the -invariant

torus in G whose Lie algebra is (h)C. By Vinberg's theorem [Vinberg1976, Theorem 1],

there exists an element g  G0 such that Adg(T ) = T . Then Adg moves the maximal compact torus Tc in T  to the maximal compact torus Tc in T , i.e.,

(4.4.12)

Adg(Tc) = Tc

Now we shall consider the polar decomposition



(4.4.13)

G = G(R) · exp( -1g)



of G generated by the decomposition gC = g  -1g as a real vector space. This polar

decomposition induces the polar decomposition 
G0 = G0(R) · exp( -1g0).

Let g = k · p be the corresponding polar decomposition of g  G0. Let a  Tc  G(R). We shall look at
Adg(a) = Adk · Adp(a)  Tc  G(R).

Since k  G(R), we have l := Adp(a)  G(R). Then we have

(4.4.14)

a-1pa = a-1lp.





Since AdG(R)(exp -1g) = exp -1g, it follows from (4.4.14) and the uniqueness of the

polar decomposition (4.4.13)

(4.4.15)

a-1pa = p.

Hence pap-1 = a for any a  Tc. Using (4.4.12) we obtain

(4.4.16)

Adk(Tc) = Tc.

It follows that Adk(h) = h. This completes the proof of Proposition 4.4.10.

Remark 4.4.17. It is easy to check that the arguments in the proofs of Lemmas 4.4.2, 4.4.7, Corollary 4.4.8, Theorem 4.4.9 and Proposition 4.4.10 are also valid for Zm-graded algebraic reductive Lie algebras over R. Hence all the results in Subsection 4.4 hold for Zm-graded algebraic reductive Lie algebras over R.

4.5. Centralizers of homogeneous semisimple elements and the Weyl group. In

this section we fix a Cartan subspace hC in gC1. The group

W (gC, )

:=

NG0 (hC) ZG0 (hC)

is finite and is called the Weyl group of the Zm-graded semisimple Lie algebra gC [Vinberg1975, Vinberg1976]. We regard W (gC, ) as a group of complex linear transformations of hC. The

Weyl group W (gC, ) depends on hC but its G0-conjugacy class does not depend on the

TRIVECTORS IN R9

45

choice of hC since all the Cartan subspaces in gC1 are G0-conjugate [Vinberg1976, Theorem 1]. Vinberg has shown that two elements of hC are in the same G0-orbit in gC1, if and only if they are in the same W (gC, )-orbit [Vinberg1976, Theorem 2]. In what follows, if no misunderstanding can occur, we shall write W instead of W (gC, ).

For p  hC we set

(4.5.1) (4.5.2) (4.5.3)

Wp := ZW (p), p := NW (Wp)/Wp,
hCp := {q  hC | g(q) = q for all g  Wp} = {q  hC | Wp  Wq}, hCp, := {q  hCp | Wq = Wp}.

Since Wp is a finite group, it is generated by elements w1, · · · , wk  W  GL(hC).
Vinberg proved that Wp is generated by complex reflections [Vinberg1976, Proposition 14]
so we can take w1, · · · , wk to be complex reflections. Clearly q  hC belongs to hCp if and only if it satisfies the following system of homogeneous linear equations

(4.5.4)

(wi - 1)q = 0 for i  [1, k].

Thus hCp is a linear subspace in hC which is the intersection of a finite number of hyperplanes. Furthermore, a q  hCp lies in hCp, if and only if (w - 1)q = 0 for all complex reflections w  W with w  Wp. Hence hCp, is Zariski-open in hCp,. It is straightforward to see that for p, p  hC and w  W we have

(4.5.5)

whCp = hCp if and only if wWpw-1 = Wp.

Lemma 4.5.6. Let p  hC and q  hCp,. If q = w · p for a w  W then w  NW (Wp).

Proof. From w · p = q we obtain Wq = wWpw-1. Taking into account Wp = Wq we conclude that w  NW (Wp).

Since W is a finite group, there exist elements p1, · · · , pN  hC such that for any q  hC the stabilizer group Wq is W -conjugate to one and only one of the stabilizer groups Wpi for 1  i  N . So by (4.5.5) for any point q  hC there is a unique i  [1, N ] such that q is W -conjugate to a point in hCpi,.
For any p  hC the linear subspace hCp is a stratified space, which can be written as a disjoint union:

(4.5.7)

n

hCp = hCp, 

hCqj,,

j=1

where qj  hCp and n = n(p).
If p is a generic point of the W -action, i.e., Wp = 1, then hCp = hC, and (4.5.7) gives a stratification of the Cartan subspace hC.

Denote by (hCp) the weight system of the adjoint representation of the subalgebra hCp on gC. Note that (hCp) is the restriction of (hC) to hCp. We define
hCp,reg := {q  hCp| (q) = 0 for all   (hCp) \ {0}}.
Elements in hCp,reg will be called (hCp)-regular.

Lemma 4.5.8. Let p  hC and q  hCp,. Then q is (hCp)-regular if and only if ZG(q) = ZG(hCp ).

Proof. Suppose that q is (hCp)-regular. Then zgC (q) = zgC(hCp). Since ZG(q) and ZG(hCp) are connected by [Steinberg1975, Theorem 3.14], we conclude that ZG(q) = ZG(hCp).

46

MIKHAIL BOROVOI, WILLEM DE GRAAF, AND HO^ NG VA^ N LE^

Conversely, if ZG(q) = ZG(hCp) then zgC (q) = zgC (hCp) implying that q is (hCp)-regular.

Following [AE1982], we say that two elements p, q  hC are in the same family or in the same W -family, if their centralizer subalgebras zgC(p) and zgC(q) are conjugate by elements in G0 or by elements in W = W (gC, ), respectively.
Given an action of a group K on a set S, if two subsets S1, S2  S are K-conjugate, i.e. on the same orbit of the action of K, we shall write S1 K S2.
For p  hC let (zgC (p), ) be the Zm-graded Lie algebra zgC (p) with the induced Zm grading, which is induced from the restriction of the action of  to zgC(p). Note that hC is a Cartan subspace in (zgC(p), ). We denote by W (zgC(p), ) its Weyl group, which acts on hC.
Proposition 4.5.9. (1) Let p, q  hC. If they are in the same family then they are in the same W -family. If hCr, = hCr,reg for all r  hC then the converse holds as well.
(2) If p, q  hC are in the same family, then ZG0(p) G0 ZG0(q).
(3) Assume that zgC(hC) is a Cartan subalgebra of gC. Then Wp = Wq implies W (zgC (p), ) = W (zgC (q), ).
Proof. (1) Assume that p, q are in the same family, that is, zgC(q) = g · zgC(p) for some g  G0. Note that both hC and g · hC are Cartan subspaces of zgC (q). Furthermore, zgC0 (p) is the subalgebra of zgC(p) consisting of elements of degree 0. By [Vinberg1976, Theorem 1] there exists an element g  ZG0(q) such that gg · hC = hC. Then gg · zgC (p) = zgC (q). It follows that
(gg)ZG(p)(gg)-1 = ZG(q) since ZG(p) is connected by [Steinberg1975, Theorem 3.14]. Denote the restriction of gg to hC by w. Then wWpw-1 = Wq. Hence p, q lie in the same W -family.
Now suppose that hCr, = hCr,reg for all r  hC and that p, q lie in the same W -family. The latter means that there is a w  W with wWpw-1 = Wq. Then from (4.5.5) it follows that w · hCp, = hCq,. By our hypothesis this entails w · hCp,reg = hCq,reg. Let g  G0 be a preimage of w. Then
g · zgC (hCp,reg) = zgC (hCq ,reg). But zgC(hCs,reg) = zgC(s) for s = p, q. Hence p, q lie in the same family.
(2) Assume that p, q  hC are in the same family. By [Steinberg1975, Theorem 3.14] ZG(p) and ZG(q) are connected. Since their Lie algebras are conjugate via an element g0 in G0, it follows that the groups ZG(p) and ZG(q) are conjugate via g0. This completes the proof of Proposition 4.5.9(2).
(3) Assume that C = zgC(hC) is a Cartan subalgebra of gC. Then C is the algebraic closure hC of hC, see (4.4.11), since otherwise, the subalgebra zgC(hC) is strictly larger than C. Hence gC satisfies the condition of Proposition 13 in [Vinberg1976], and therefore Wp = W (zgC(p), ) [Vinberg1976, §6.3]. This identity is a consequence of [Vinberg1976, Proposition 19], asserting that if the algebraic closure hC is a Cartan subalgebra C in gC then the Weyl group W (gC, ) of the Zm-graded Lie algebra gC can be identified with the subgroup in the Weyl group W (gC,  = Id) of the ungraded Lie algebra gC that leaves  invariant, taking into account the fact that for the ungraded Lie algebra (gC,  = Id), we have Wp(gC,  = Id) = W (zgC(p),  = Id), since in this case Wp(gC,  = Id) is generated by the reflections r  W (zgC(p),  = Id), where (C) denotes the root system of gC w.r.t. C, and
  (C, p) := {  (C)| (p) = 0},

zgC (p) = C

gC.

(C,p)

Here gC denotes the corresponding root subspace.

Hence Wp = Wq implies W (zgC(p), ) = W (zgC(q), ). This completes the proof Proposition 4.5.9 (3). It is known that W (gC, hC) is generated by complex reflections w for   (hC), whose fixed point q is defined by the equation (q) = 0, see e.g. [OV1990,

Theorem 10 p. 163].

Lemma 4.5.10. Let p  hC and assume that hCp, = hCp,reg. Let q  hCp,. Then ZG0(p) = ZG0 (q).

Proof. By Lemma 4.5.8 we see that ZG(p) = ZG(q). Their intersections with G0 are ZG0(p) and ZG0(q) respectively. Hence these are equal as well. Lemma 4.5.11. Let p  hC and assume that hCp, = hCp,reg. Let p1, p2  hCp, and let g  G0 be such that gp1 = p2. Then gq  hCp, for all q  hCp,.

Proof. Let q  hCp,. Let NW (Wp) be the normalizer of Wp in W . Since p1, p2 are G0-

conjugate there is a w  NW (Wp) with wp1 = p2 (Lemma 4.5.6). Let w^  G0 be a preimage

of w. Then g-1w^  follows that gq = w^q

ZG0 (p1 ). which lies

Hence by in hCp,.

Now fix a p  hC and write F = hCp,. We set ZG0(F) = {g  G0 | gq = q for all q  F}, NG0(F) = {g  G0 | gq  F for all q  F}.

We define a map  : NG0(F)  p (where p = NW (Wp)/Wp, see (4.5.1)). Let g  NG0(F). Then gp = q for some q  F. By Lemma 4.5.6 there is a w  NW (Wp) such that wp = q. Set (g) = wWp. Note that this is well defined: if w  NW (Wp) also satisfies wp = q then w-1w  Wp so that wWp = wWp.
Lemma 4.5.12. Suppose that hCp, = hCp,reg. Then  is a surjective group homomorphism with kernel ZG0(F).

Proof. First we note the following: let g  NG0(F) be such that gp = q and let w  NW (Wp) be such that wp = q; then for all r  F we have that gr = wr. Indeed, Let w^  G0 be a preimage of w. Then w^-1g  ZG0(p). So by Lemma 4.5.10 it follows that w^-1g  ZG0(r), or gr = w^r = wr.
Now let g1, g2  NG0(F) and let w1, w2  NW (Wp) be such that wip = gip, i = 1, 2. Then by the first part of the proof we see that g1g2p = w1w2p implying that  is a group homomorphism.
Let w^  G0 be a preimage of w  NW (Wp). Then w^  NG0(F) and (w^) = wWp so that  is surjective. If g  ker  then gp = p and by the first part of the proof, g  ZG0(F).

Now we let h be a Cartan subspace in g1 so that its complexification hC is a Cartan subspace in gC1. For a p  h we consider the sets hp = hCp  h and hp = hCp,.
Proposition 4.5.13. (1) If p  h is regular, then G0(p)  g1 consists of L G0(R)-orbits, where L is the number of conjugacy classes of Cartan subspaces in g1.
(2) Assume that all Cartan subspaces in g1 are conjugate. Let p  hC. Then the orbit G0(p) contains a real point in g1 if and only if the orbit W (p) contains a real point in h. For any q  h the set of G0(R)-orbits in G0(q)  g1 is in a canonical bijection with the set
ker[H1Wq  H1W ].

48

MIKHAIL BOROVOI, WILLEM DE GRAAF, AND HO^ NG VA^ N LE^

Proof. (1) For any regular semisimple element p  h, there is unique Cartan subspace h(p)  g1 that contains p. This implies the first assertion of Proposition 4.5.13.
(2) Assume that all Cartan subspaces in g1 are G0(R)-conjugate and the orbit G0(p), p  hC, contains a real point pR  g1. Since all Cartan subspaces in g1 are conjugate, pR is G0(R)-conjugate to a point pR in h. Hence p is G0-conjugate to pR  h, and therefore it is W -conjugate to pR. This proves the first assertion of Proposition 4.5.13 (2).
The last assertion of Proposition 4.5.13(2) follows from [Vinberg1976, Theorem 2], the first assertion of Proposition 4.5.13(2), and Proposition 3.1.15, (also Proposition 3.6.5).
Proposition 4.5.14. Let p  h. Assume that hCp, = hCp,reg and let q, q  hp. Then q and q are G0(R)-conjugate, if and only if there is a g  NG0(R)(hp) with g · q = q.
Proof. This follows directly from Lemma 4.5.11.

The groups W and p have a conjugation induced from G0 and we denote the group of the real points of p by p(R). Also we write

p(g, h)

:=

NG0(R)(hp) ZG0 (R) (hp )

The group p(g, h) acts on hp by restricting the action of NG0(R)(hp) to hp. Lemma 4.5.15. Assume that p  h and hCp, = hCp,reg.
(1) NG0 (hCp)(p) = p(p). (2) There is a 1-1 correspondence between the set of p(g, h)-orbits in p(p)  hp and ker[H1ZG0 (hCp)  H1NG0(hCp)]. (3) The set p(p)  hp consists of a single p(R)-orbit.

Proof. The first assertion follows from Lemma 4.5.12. The second and last assertion of Lemma 4.5.15 are direct consequences of Proposition 3.1.15, taking into account that p acts freely on hp, which implies, in particular, that the stabilizer of p in p is trivial and therefore p(R) has one orbit in p(p)  hp.
Corollary 4.5.16. Assume the condition of Lemma 4.5.15.
(1) There is a natural embedding p(g, h) into p(R) and there is a 1-1 correspondence between p(R)/p(g, h) and ker[H1ZG0 (hCp)  H1NG0(hCp)].
(2) If H1ZG0 (hCp) = 1 then p(g, h) = p(R).
Proof. (1) If hCp, = hCp,reg then p(g, h) acts on hp without fixed point. Then the orbit p(g, h)(p) is a subset of the orbit p(R)(p) by Lemma 4.5.15 (2). It is not hard to see that this natural set inclusion is group homomorphism. The first assertion of Corollary 4.5.16 then follows from Lemma 4.5.15.
The second assertion follows directly from the first one.

4.6. Conjugacy and centralizers of mixed elements. Let x = px +ex and y = py +ey be the Jordan decompositions of homogeneous elements x, y  g1 of a real (resp. complex) Zm-graded semisimple Lie algebra g (resp. gC).
The following proposition is straightforward.
Proposition 4.6.1. Elements x, y  gC1 (resp. in g1) are in the same G0-orbit (resp. in the same G0(R)-orbit) if and only if there exists an element g0  G0 (resp. g0  G0(R))

TRIVECTORS IN R9

such that Adg0px = py and Adg0 ex and ey are ZG0 (py)-conjugate (resp. ZG0(R)(py) conjugate), that is, they are in the same ZG0(py)-orbit (resp. ZG0(R)(py)-orbit) in the
Zm-graded reductive Lie algebra zgC(py) (resp. zg(py)).

Vinberg observed that any Zm-graded reductive complex Lie algebra g is a direct sum of its commutative ideal ga and its derived algebra Dg with induced grading, [Vinberg1976, §3]. The analogous assertion also holds for Zm-graded reductive real Lie algebras g by considering the complexification gC.
Assume that px + ex is the Jordan decomposition of a homogeneous element x  gC1 (resp. in g1) in a Zm-graded complex (resp. real) semisimple Lie algebra gC (resp. g). Then ex lies in the derived algebra D(zgC (px)) of zgC (p) (resp. in D(zg(px)) of zg(px)). Note that ZG(px) is a connected algebraic reductive group and its can be written as a product of its connected component of its center Z(ZG(px)) and a connected semisimple Lie subgroup DZG(px) whose Lie algebra is the derived Lie algebra D(zg(px)). Thus we have the projection
 : ZG(px)  DZG(px).
The center Z(ZG(px)) acts trivially on D(zg(px)). Denote by DZG0(px) the image (ZG0(px))  D(ZG(px)). Hence we obtain from Proposition 4.6.1 immediately [VE1978, p. 80]
Proposition 4.6.2. Let px + ex and px + ey be the Jordan decomposition of two homogeneous elements x, y  gC1  gC (resp. in g1  g) with px = py = p. Then p + ex and p + ey are in the same G0-orbit (resp. G0(R)-orbit), if and only if ex and ey are in the same orbit of the action of DZG0(p) (resp. of DZG0(R)(p)) on the Zm-graded derived algebra DzgC (p) of zgC(p) (resp. of Dzg(p)  zg(p)).

Now we shall relate the centralizer ZG0(p + e) of a mixed homogeneous element p + e with the centralizer ZG0(p).
Theorem 4.6.3. Let p+e be the Jordan decomposition of a homogeneous element p+e  g1 in a Zm-graded semisimple Lie algebra g over C. Then ZG0(p + e) is a subgroup of the reductive algebraic group ZG0(p) and the Lie algebra zg0(p + e) of the group ZG0(p + e) has the following Levi decomposition
zg0 (p + e) = (zg0 (p)  [zg0(p), e])  zg0 (p)[t(e)]
where t(e) is the sl2-triple associated to the nilpotent element e in Dzg(p).

Proof. Since the Jordan decomposition is unique we have ZG0(p + e) = ZZG0(p)(e).
Using this we obtain Theorem 4.6.3 immediately from Lemma 4.3.12.

5. Computational methods
In this section we discuss the computational problems that we dealt with in order to compute the various objects that play a role in our investigation.
First we describe a special construction of the representation  : SL(9, C)  GL( 3 C9), also used by Vinberg and Elashvili ([VE1978], see also [Le2011, Example 3.3.v]). Let gC denote the simple complex Lie algebra of type E8. We let  denote its root system with basis of simple roots . We use a fixed Chevalley basis of gC. This basis consists of vectors h for    and x for    (see [Humphreys1980], Chapter 25). We use the following enumeration of the Dynkin diagram

We write  = {1, . . . , 8}. Then the set consisting of hi , xi, x-i for 1  i  8 is a canonical generating set of gC. Fix a primitive third root of unity   C. For i = 2

we set hi = hi , xi = xi , x-i = x-i . Furthermore we set h2 = h2 , x2 = x2,

x-2 = 2x-2. Then the canonical generating set of

extends to a unique automorphism  of gC ([Jacobson1962], Chapter IV, Theorem 3). We

let gCi be the eigenspace of  corresponding to the eigenvalue i. Then gC0 is isomorphic to sl(9, C). The space gC1 is a gC0-module, and hence a sl(9, C)-module, isomorphic to 3 C9.

From the construction it is clear that the spaces gCi are defined over R, that is, they have bases whose elements are R-linear combinations of the basis elements of gC. By gi
we denote the R-span of these bases. Furthermore, the hi span a Cartan subalgebra of gC0 that is split over R. Hence we have an isomorphism C : sl(9, C)  gC0 which restricts to an isomorphism  : sl(9, R)  g0. Because SL(9, C) is simply connected, C lifts to a homomorphism of algebraic groups C : SL(9, C)  G0, which in turn restricts to a homomorphism  : SL(9, R)  G0(R).

The map C is not explicitly given, but we do have its differential C : sl(9, C)  gC0 explicitly (that is, we have an algorithm that computes C(x) for any given x  sl(9, C)).

Via the map C we let sl(9, C) act on gC1, and we fix a sl(9, C)-module isomorphism C : gC1  3(C9). This map is not unique, but if we fix a choice of positive roots in the root system of sl(9, C), then the highest-weight vectors in gC1 and 3(C9) are uniquely determined (up to multiplication by nonzero scalars), and they in turn determine C up

to a scalar multiple. Furthermore, C is also a SL(9, C)-module isomorphism.

We use this maps to realize the action of SL(9, C) on gC0 and on gC1. For g  SL(9, C) and x  gC0, u  gC1 we have g · x = C(g(C)-1(x)g-1) and g · u = (C)-1(g · C (u)).

5.1. Computing centralizers. Let e  gC1 be a nilpotent element lying in the homogeneous sl2-triple t = (h, e, f ). We want to compute the centralizer
Z0(t) = {g  SL(9, C) | g · h = h, g · e = e, g · f = f }.
Moreover, we require a description of Z0(t) that is useful for the determination of the cohomology set H1Z0(t) (which we use to find the real forms of the complex orbit of e, see Theorem 4.3.8). We cannot say precisely what that means, but as a general rule it means that we need a description from which we can easily read off the structure of the group (for example, we need to know the isomorphism type of the identity component, and the structure of the component group).
As a first step we determine a set of polynomial equations that define Z0(t) as a subgroup of SL(9, C). Observe that by Lemma 4.3.1 we have that Z0(t) consists of g  SL(9, C) with g · h = h and g · e = e. We note that the set of g  SL(9, C) with g · h = h is the same as the set of g  SL(9, C) with g(C)-1(h) = (C)-1(h)g. In order to compute the corresponding polynomial equations we let g be a matrix whose entries are indeterminates, x11, x12, . . . , x99. Then the equality g(C)-1(h) = (C)-1(h)g simply translates to a set of linear equations in the xij. For the equations corresponding to g · e = e we set u = C(e). Again we let g be a 9 × 9-matrix whose entries are indeterminates. Then g · u is a linear combination of basis elements of 3(C9) with coefficients that are polynomials in the indeterminates. This way we get a set of polynomials describing the set of g  SL(9, C)

TRIVECTORS IN R9

51

with g · e = e. Finally we add the polynomial det(g) - 1 to the set of polynomials. In order to arrive at a description of the group Z0(t) we first compute a Gro¨bner basis of the ideal generated by the polynomials that we obtained. For a general introduction into the theory of Gro¨bner bases we refer to [CLO2015]. Here we use a lexicographical monomial order to get a Gro¨bner basis with a triangular structure. In many cases the Gro¨bner basis computation succeeds and allows us to read off the group structure.
In quite a few cases however, the Gro¨bner basis computation turned out to be too difficult. Here we list the methods that we have applied in those cases.
First of all, we note that the centralizer z0(t) = {x  sl(9, C) | [C(x), h] = [C(x), e] = [C(x), f ] = 0} can readily be obtained by solving a set of linear equations. We have that z0(t) = Lie(Z0(t)), so from z0(t) the identity component of Z0(t) can in principle be determined. This is particularly straightforward if the identity component is a torus. In that case Z0(t) is determined by a lattice in the character group of a maximal torus containing it; and this lattice is easily computed from z0(t) (see [Graaf2017], Example 4.2.5). If Z0(t) is semisimple then from z0(t) we can deduce the root datum of Z0(t), and hence its isomorphism type. In general Z0(t) is the product of its semisimple part and a central torus. However, it can happen that these two groups have a finite but nontrivial intersection. This intersection needs to be determined as well.
Now we give some examples of situations where additional tricks helped to determine Z0(t).
Example 5.1.1. (1) Suppose that Z0(t) is a 1-dimensional torus consisting of elements T (a) for a  C×. This torus has two algebraic automorphisms, the identity and the map T (a)  T (a-1). As Z0(t) is normal in Z0(t) we see that the latter group is the disjoint union of
A = {g  Z0(t) | gT (a)g-1 = T (a)}, B = {g  Z0(t) | gT (a)g-1 = T (a-1)}.
Let u0 be a fixed nonzero element of z0(t). Then
A = {g  Z0(t) | gu0g-1 = u0} = {g  Z0(t) | gu0 = u0g},
B = {g  Z0(t) | gu0g-1 = -u0} = {g  Z0(t) | gu0 = -u0g}.
So we compute two Gro¨bner bases: one of the ideal generated by the original polynomials along with linear polynomials equivalent to gu0 = u0g. For the second we add the linear polynomials that are equivalent to gu0 = -u0g. These two Gro¨bner basis computations are significantly easier than the original one. (2) Suppose that z0(t) has a semisimple part s. Then Z0(t) acts by conjugation on s. Let S be the connected subgroup of Z0(t) with Lie algebra s. Then the inner automorphisms of s are realized as conjugation by elements of S.
Let hi, ei, fi for 1  i   be a canonical generating set of s. This means that ei are root vectors corresponding to the positive simple roots, the fi are root vectors corresponding to the negative simple roots and the hi = [ei, fi] satisfy [hi, ei] = 2ei, [hi, fi] = -2fi (see [Jacobson1962], Chapter IV). Canonical generating sets are by no means unique. But it is well known that if hi, ei, fi is a second canonical generating set then there is an inner automorphism  of s such that (hi) = h(i), (ei) = e(i), (fi) = f(i), where  is a permutation of {1, . . . , }. Here  corresponds to a diagram automorphisms of the Dynkin diagram of s.
This implies the following. Let hi, ei, fi for 1  i   be a fixed canonical generating set of s. Then each component of Z0(t) has an element whose conjugation action on s maps hi  h(i), ei  e(i), fi  f(i), where  is a diagram automorphism of the Dynkin diagram of s. Now for example ghig-1 = h(i) is the same (for invertible g) as ghi = h(i)g. This means that the condition that g conjugates

52

MIKHAIL BOROVOI, WILLEM DE GRAAF, AND HO^ NG VA^ N LE^

hi to h(i) can be expressed by linear equations in the entries of g. Now if we want to find an element of each component of Z0(t) then we add the resulting linear equations to the original polynomial equations. This usually leads to a much easier

Gro¨bner basis computation. The resulting polynomial equations tend to be easily

solvable. So we can try to determine the component group this way. Of course, it

may happen that the same  is realized by elements in more then one component.

We illustrate this with the determination of Z0(t) in case 54 of the list of

nilpotent orbits. Here z0(t) is of type A1, and the 9-dimensional module splits as

a direct sum of modules of dimensions 2, 3, 4. Let v1, . . . , v9 denote the standard

basis of the 9-dimensional module. Then the submodules are v6, v7 , v3, v4, v5 , v1, v2, v8, v9 . So a matrix in Z0(t) consists of three blocks of respective sizes 2×2,

3 × 3 and 4 × 4. The rows and columns 6, 7 have a block of size 2 × 2. So on that

position we have a copy of SL(2, C), and the other blocks contain homomorphic

images of that group. The Lie algebra z0(t) has only inner automorphisms. So each coset of the component group contains an element that is the identity on the Lie

algebra. Adding the corresponding linear equations we find that the subgroup of

Z0(t) that acts as the identity on z0(t) consists of diag(t, t, t4, t4, t4, t, t, t, t), where

t6 = 1. For t = 1 and t = -1 these Hence Z0(t) = SL(2, C) × µ3.

component

of

Z0(t).

(3) If the identity component is a torus whose weight spaces on the natural 9-dimensional

module are all 1-dimensional, then we can use the corresponding characters to de-

termine the component group. We illustrate this by the computation of Z0(p1 + 2p2), where p = p1 + 2p2 is an element of the third canonical set F3 considered in

Section 7.3.

From computing the Lie algebra we see that T4 = Z0(p) is a 4-dimensional

torus consisting of

T4(t1, t2, t3, t4) = diag(t1, t2, (t1t2)-1, t3, t4, (t3t4)-1, (t1t3)-1, (t2t4)-1, t1t2t3t4),

for t1, t2, t3, t4  C×. Let X(T4) denote its character lattice, whose group operation we write additively. Then X(T4) = Zµ1 + · · · + Zµ4, where µi(T4(t1, t2, t3, t4)) = ti. Let X9 denote the set of characters of T4 that correspond to the natural 9dimensional module. Then

X9 = {µ1, µ2, µ3, µ4, -µ1 - µ2, . . . , µ1 + µ2 + µ3 + µ4}.

If g  GL(9, C) normalizes T4 then for µ  X(T4) we have that g · µ, defined by (g · µ)(t) = µ(g-1tg), also lies in X(T4). The map µ  g · µ is an automorphism of X(T4) and thus can be represented by an element of GL(4, Z). Moreover, µ  X9 if and only if g · µ  X9. Now for an element of GL(4, Z) that stabilizes X9 we only
have 9 choices for the image of each µi. So we can write down all possibilities and check by computer which correspond to elements of GL(4, Z) stabilizing X9. The result is a group G72 of order 72 generated by 1, 2, 3, where
(a) 1 interchanges µ1, µ4 and fixes µ2, µ3, (b) 2 maps µ1  µ2  µ4  µ3  µ1, (c) 3 fixes µ1, µ2 and maps µ3  -µ1 - µ3, µ4  -µ2 - µ4.
Write X9 = {1, . . . , 9}. The weight spaces corresponding to these characters are spanned by the standard basis vectors v1, . . . , v9. Let g  GL(9, C) normalize T4 and let   S9 be such that g · i = (i). A small calculation shows that gvi lies in the weight space corresponding to (i) so that gvi is a nonzero scalar multiple of v(i). Hence g = MU , where M  GL(9, C) is such that M(vi) = v(i) and U  T9, where T9 is the standard 9-dimensional torus of GL(9, C).
The possibilities for the permutations  follow directly from the group G72. For each of the possible  we determine the intersection of Z0(p) and MT9 (this

TRIVECTORS IN R9

53

can be done by Gro¨bner bases as we know the defining equations for the group Z0(p)). It turns out that this intersection is either empty or equal to MT4. Hence the component group consists of the cosets of the M where  is such that the intersection is not empty.
(4) The next example concerns just one case. We want to compute the centralizer Z0(t) of the homogeneous sl2-triple t = (h, e, f ) with

e = e137 - e246 - e247 + e348 - e358 + e368 + e458 + e569.

(This is case 31 in Section 6.) From the Lie algebra of the centralizer we know
that Z0(t) is a finite group. We let e1, . . . , e9 denote the standard basis of C9. Let V4 = e1, e2, e8, e9 ,
V5 = e3, . . . , e7 . Then the elements of Z0(h) consist of block-matrices, with a 4 × 4 and a 5 × 5-block, the first one stabilizing V4 and the second one stabilizing V5 So we identify Z0(h) with

{(g1, g2)  GL(V5) × GL(V4) | det g1 det g2 = 1}.

Write v1 = e3, . . . , v5 = e7, w1 = e1, w2 = e2, w3 = e8, w4 = e9. Then with u1 = v1  v5, u2 = -v2  v4 - v2  v5, u3 = v1  v2 - v1  v3 + v1  v4 + v2  v3, u4 = v3  v4 (so ui  2 V5) we have

e = u1  w1 + u2  w1 + u3  w3 + u4  w4.

Now let g  Z0(t) then in particular g  Z0(h) so that g = (g1, g2), g1  GL(V5),

g2  GL(V4). Write g2 · wj =

4 k=1

akj wk ,

then

g · e = g1 · uj  g2 · wj = ( akjg1 · uj )  wk.

In

particular,

if

we

let

U be the subspace of 2 V5 spanned by u1, . . . , u4, then g1 · U = U .

Now we look for elements of order dividing 2 in Z0(t). For this we first consider

the group H5 = {g1  GL(V5) | g1 ·U = U }, which is defined by a set of polynomial equations of degree 2. To these we add the equations expressing that g12 = 1. This yields a 0-dimensional ideal whose Gro¨bner basis we can easily compute. By

inspecting it we see that the set of polynomial equations has 52 solutions, which

we denote by g11, . . . , g152. Next, We let the matrix (arik) be the

for each r inverse of

w(berikfi)nadndbriksewtitgh2r

g1r =

.

Finally we

check whether det(g1r) det(g2r) = 1. This then yields 26 elements of Z0(t) of order

dividing 2, and hence 25 elements h1, . . . , h25 of order exactly 2.

Finally, for 1  i < j  25 we consider the subgroups Mij = {g  Z0(t) | ghi =

hjg} (note that a g  Z0(t) conjugates an element of order 2 to an element of order

2, so each such g lies in some of these subgroups). To compute them we add the

linear polynomials expressing that ghi = hjg to the defining polynomials of Z0(t).

It turned out that the corresponding ideals have easily computable Gro¨bner bases.

By solving the corresponding polynomial equations we then arrive at the group

outlined in case 31 of Section 6.

5.2. Computing representatives. Let e  gC1 be nilpotent lying in the homogeneous sl2-triple t = (h, e, f ). The elements of H1Z0(t) correspond to the SL(9, R)-orbits that are contained in the SL(9, C)-orbit of t. Here we consider the problem of computing

54

MIKHAIL BOROVOI, WILLEM DE GRAAF, AND HO^ NG VA^ N LE^

representatives of these orbits. That is, for a given [g]  H1Z0(t) we want to find a h  SL(9, C) such that h · t is a representative of the SL(9, R)-orbit corresponding to [g].
The map  from Proposition 3.1.15 maps the SL(9, R)-orbit of h · t to [c]  H1Z0(t) where c = h-1 h. In our situation the cocycle c = g is given, the problem is to find h. So we need to find h  SL(9, C) such that h = hg.
For this we work in the space M9(C) of 9 × 9-complex matrices, which we view as a vector space over R of dimension 162. We note that the equation h = hg is equivalent to a set of 81 R-linear equations on the entries of h. We solve this set of linear equations over R, to get a basis b1, . . . , bm of an R-subspace of M9(C). Any complex matrix h that satisfies h = hg is an R-linear combination of the elements of this basis.
Now we can take indeterminates x1, . . . , xm, form the matrix b = i xibi, compute its determinant d  C[x1, . . . , xm], and determine 1, . . . , m  R such that d(1, . . . , m) = 1. Then h = i ibi does the job.
Note that it is straightforward to find a subset bi1, . . . , bir of the basis whose span contains invertible matrices. Then we can do the same as before, that is, set b = k xik bik and find values for the xij such that the determinant is 1. This way we have to deal with a lot fewer indeterminates. Alternatively, in practice it turned out also to be possible to try some random values of the xik to find an element of determinant 1.

5.3. Computing the Galois cohomology of a torus. Let T = (T, T ) be a complex torus. Let XT be its cocharacter group which we write additively, so that XT = Zr for some r > 0. Let T be as in Definition 3.5.2 and let
e : XT  T(C), x  x(-1).
be as in Construction 3.5.3. As seen in Proposition 3.5.4 the map e(1) : H1XT  H1 T is an isomorphism. We have e(1)([x]) = [x(-1)].
Now XT is abelian so Definition 3.1.3 translates to H1XT = ker(1 + T )/im (1 - T ).
So computing H1 T reduces to computing ker(1 + T ), im (1 - T ) and the quotient of the two. We write the matrix of T with respect to the standard basis of Zr. Then a basis of im (1 - T ) can be computed using algorithms for computing Hermite normal forms (see [Sim1994]). Computing ker(1 + T ) amounts to solving a set of homogeneous linear equations over Z. There are well-known algorithms for this, but they are not very well documented; one reference is [Graaf2017], §6.2. Finally computing the quotient can be done using a Smith normal form computation (see [Sim1994]).

Example 5.3.1. Let T be a 3-dimensional torus consisting of the elements T (s, t, u) where

s, t, u  C× and T (s, t, u)T (s, t, u) = T (ss, tt, uu). Let  : T  T be the conjugation

given by

(T (s, t, u)) = T (s-2t-2u-1, s2t-3u2, s-1t-2u-2).

The cocharacter group has basis xs, xt, xu, where xs(z) = T (z, 1, 1), xt(z) = T (1, z, 1), xu(z) = T (1, 1, z). We have

T (xs)(z) = (xs(z)) = T (z-2, z2, z-1) = xs(z)-2xt(z)2xu(z)-1.

Similarly we compute T (xt), T (xu). Then the matrix of T with respect to the standard

basis e1, e2, e3 of Z3 is

M

=

-2 2

-2 3

-21 .

-1 -2 -2

The kernel of 1 + M is spanned by e1 - e3, e2 - 2e3. The image of 1 - M is spanned

by e1 - e3, 2e2 - 4e3. We see that the quotient has order 2 and consists of [0] and

TRIVECTORS IN R9

55

[e2 - 2e3]. The second element corresponds to x = xtx-u 2 and x(-1) = T (1, -1, 1). Hence H1T = {[1], [T (1, -1, 1)]}.

5.4. Deciding conjugacy of nilpotent elements. Here we let a be a complex semisimple Lie algebra with a Zm-grading a = iZ ai. We note that a0 is reductive in a (see [Kac1995, Lemma 8.1(c)]). This means that a0 = s  t, where s is semisimple and t is a central subalgebra such that ad ax is diagonalizable for all x  t. We let A0 be an algebraic group of automorphisms of a stabilizing each component ai and such that the identity component A0 is the connected algebraic subgroup of the adjoint group of a with Lie algebra a0 (or, more precisely, ad aa0). We also assume that the component group is given explicitly (that is, we have explicit automorphisms of a whose cosets form the component group). The problem that we consider is the following: given nilpotent e1, e2  a1, decide whether they are conjugate under A0.
First we describe how to associate a sequence of integers, called the characteristic to a nilpotent element. Let e  a1 be nilpotent lying in the homogeneous sl2-triple (h, e, f ). Let h0  a0 be a Cartan subalgebra containing h. Let 0 denote the root system of a0 with respect to h0, and let 0 be a set of simple roots. The Weyl group W (0) of 0 acts on h0 in the following way. Let    and let s be the corresponding reflection in W (0). Let h be the unique element of [a0,, a0,-] (where a0,± are the root spaces corresponding to ±) with (h) = 2. Then s(u) = u - (u)h for u  h0. Let z = x + iy, x, y  R, then we write z > 0 if x > 0 or x = 0 and y > 0. Let C0 = {u  h | (u)  0 for all   0}. It is routine to show that every u  h0 is W (0)-conjugate to a unique element of C0. Let h  C0 be conjugate to h. Then the characteristic of the orbit of e is the sequence consisting of (h) for   0.
Now we discuss to which extent the A0-orbit of e determines its characteristic. For the computation of the characteristic we make many choices. All Cartan subalgebras of a0 are conjugate under A0 hence the characteristic does not depend on the choice of Cartan subalgebra containing h and neither does it depend on the choice of representative e of the orbit, nor on the choice of sl2-triple, nor on the choice of set of simple roots 0. However, it does depend on the order in which we list the simple roots. This order can be prescribed to some extend by fixing an enumeration of the nodes of the Dynkin diagram. But if the Dynkin diagram has nontrivial automorphisms there are more ways to list the simple roots according to the prescribed ordering. So the characteristic is determined by the A0-orbit of e up to an automorphism of the Dynkin diagram of 0. We say that two sequences of integers, whose entries correspond to the nodes of the Dynkin diagram of 0, are essentially different if there is no diagram automorphism mapping one to the other. Otherwise we say that they are essentially equal. So using Theorem 4.3.5 we conclude that if the characteristics of two nilpotent elements are essentially different then they lie in different orbits.
We note also that if t is nonzero then there are infinitely many elements of the set C0 yielding the same characteristic. So in that case quite a few nilpotent orbits may share the same characteristic. The extreme case happens when s = 0, as then all characteristics are empty, so all nilpotent elements have the same characteristic.
Now we describe an algorithm by which we can always decide A0-conjugacy of two nilpotent elements. It is, however, computationally more difficult than the algorithm to compute the characteristic. Let ti = (hi, ei, fi) be homogeneous sl2-triples for i = 1, 2. By [Graaf2017, Theorem 8.3.6] the ei are A0-conjugate if and only if h1, h2 are A0conjugate. Therefore, starting with e1, e2 the first step is to compute homogeneous sl2triples ti. After that we compute Cartan subalgebras h10, h20 of a0 such that hi0 contains hi. Then we compute the root systems i0 of a0 corresponding to hi0. Corresponding to each

56

MIKHAIL BOROVOI, WILLEM DE GRAAF, AND HO^ NG VA^ N LE^

root system we compute a canonical generating set of a0. Mapping the elements of the first canonical generating set (corresponding to 10) to the corresponding elements of the second canonical generating set (corresponding to 20) extends to a unique automorphism  of a0 (see [Jacobson1962], Chapter IV, Theorem 3). By the methods of [CMT2004], see also [Graaf2017, Section 5.7], we can decide whether  is an inner automorphism, that is, whether   A0. If not we compose  with a permutation of the canonical generators corresponding to 10 to obtain a   A0 with (h1) = h2. Set h1 = (h1). Let C02 = {u  h2 | (u)  0} be as above. Compute w1, w2  W (2) such that w1h1 and w2h2 lie in C02. Then h1, h2 (and hence e1, e2) are A0-conjugate if and only if wh1 = wh2.
If the component group of A0 is not trivial then for each coset A0 in the component group one has to check whether e1 and (e1) are A0-conjugate.

Example 5.4.1. Let gC be the Z3-graded Lie algebra considered in this paper (see the beginning of the section). Then gC0 is simple of type A8. Hence the Dynkin diagram has one nontrivial automorphism. However, by inspecting the characteristics of the nilpotent orbits (they are listed in Table 1) it is seen that applying the corresponding permutation to a characteristic does not yield the characteristic of a different orbit. So in this case the characteristic determines the nilpotent orbit.

Let p  gC1 be a semisimple element of the set F6 (see Section 7). Let a = zgC(p) be the centralizer of p in gC. Then a inherits the grading from gC. Here a is of type E6,

and a0 is semisimple of type 3A2. So there are many nontrivial diagram automorphisms.

However,

here

A0

G0

is

to permute the nilpotent

not connected and A0-orbits in such

the elements of the component group happen a way that from each group of orbits with

essentially equal characteristics only one remains. So also in this case the characteristic

can be used to determine conjugacy of nilpotent elements.

Let p  gC1 be a semisimple element of the set F5. Again set a = zgC(p). Then a0 is reductive of type A2 + T2 where T2 denotes a 2-dimensional toral center. In this case there are different nilpotent orbits having the essentially the same characteristic, because of the T2 component. (It turns out that there are six characteristics and each of them is the characteristic of three nilpotent orbits.) So here we cannot decide conjugacy by only looking at the characteristic and we have to resort to the more brute force method outlined above.

6. The centralizers of the nilpotent orbits and their Galois cohomology
For each nilpotent orbit we describe the centralizer in SL(9, C) of a corresponding sl2triple. In all cases this centralizer is denoted by Z0. Its Lie algebra is denoted by z0. Secondly, we determine the Galois cohomology set H1Z0.
Throughout we use the facts that H1GL(n, C) = H1SL(n, C) = 1. In particular, if T is a torus with the standard -action then H1T = 1. For tori with a different -action the Galois cohomology is computed using the method of Section 5.3. When we say that two groups with -action are isomorphic we mean that they are -equivariantly isomorphic.
The numbers in bold refer the position in the list of Elashvili and Vinberg ([VE1978]). However, we used different representatives that were computed with the algorithms described in [Graaf2017], Chapter 8.
The rank of a trivector u in 3 C9 is the dimension of the smallest subspace U of C9 such that u  3 U . The classification of the nilpotent trivectors in 3 C9 of rank < 9 coincides with the classification of the trivectors in 3 C8 (we remark that all trivectors in this space are nilpotent). The latter classification has been carried out by Gurevich, see [Gurevich1935], who obtained 23 orbits. To each orbit Gurevich assigned a roman

TRIVECTORS IN R9

numeral, see [Gurevich1964]. Below for each trivector of rank < 9 we also give its rank, and its Gurevich number. The orbit with number I just consists of 0, so we do not list it.

with a3 = -1 and bc = -a2. This set has three components too.

The multiplication law in Z0 is as follows: X(a, b, c) · X(a, b, c) = X(aa, bb, cc).

X(a, b, c) · Y (a, b, c) = Y (aa, bb, cc) Y (a, b, c) · X(a, b, c) = Y (aa, cb, bc) Y (a, b, c) · Y (a, b, c) = X(aa, -bc, -cb)

Lemma. H1Z0 = {1, [b1], [b2]}, where b1 = Y (-1, -1, 1) and b2 = Y (-1, 1, -1).

Proof. Write C = µ6 = {a  C× | a6 = 1}. Consider the homomorphism

j : Z0  C, X(a, b, c)  a, Y (a, b, c)  a.

Set A = ker j = {X(1, b, c) | bc = 1}.

We have a short exact sequence

(6.0.1)

1  A --i Z0 --j C  1

where i is the inclusion map. By Proposition 3.1.16 we obtain a cohomology exact sequence

(6.0.2)

1  A  Z0  C -- H1A --i H1Z0 --j H1C.

We have H1C = {[1], [-1]}. Thus H1Z0 = j-1[1]  j-1[-1].

Since A is a torus we have H1A = 1. Hence from (6.0.2) it follows that j-1[1] = {[1]}.

Write c1 = b1 and

C, b1 = Thus b1

Y (-1, -1, 1)  Z0; then b1 is  Z1Z0, and we can twist the

a lift exact

sequence (6.0.1) by the cocycle b1. By Corollary 3.1.22, the set j-1[-1] is in a canonical

bijection with the set of orbits of the group (b1C) in the set H1b1A.

Since C is an abelian group, we have b1C = c1C = C. Thus (b1C) = C = {1, -1}.

For b  C×, we have

X(1, b, b-1) = b1 · X(1, b, b-1) · b-1 1 = b1 · X(1, ¯b, ¯b-1) · b-1 1 = X(1, ¯b-1, ¯b). We -equivariantly identify b1A with
Ctw := C× with the twisted -action b = ¯b-1.

By Example 3.1.7(3) we have

H1b1A = H1 Ctw = {[1], [-1]}.

We compute the action of c1 = -1  (b1C) = C on 1  H1b1A. Since b21 = 1, by Lemma 3.1.29 the element c1  C fixes [1]  H1b1A. Since #H1b1A = 2, we see that c1 acts on H1b1A trivially. Thus (b1C) = C acts on H1b1A trivially. We see that (b1C) has two orbits in H1b1A, with representatives 1 and -1 = X(1, -1 - 1) in Z1b1A. Their images in H1Z0 are b1(1) = [1 · b1] = [b1] and
b1[X(1, -1, -1)] = [X(1, -1, -1) · Y (-1, -1, 1)] = [Y (-1, 1, -1)] = [b2],

where b1 is the map of (3.1.13).

Alternative proof. Consider the homomorphism

2 : Z0  µ3, X(a, b, c)  a2, Y (a, b, c)  a2.

We have a short exact sequence

1  B  Z0  µ3  1, where B = ker 2 . Since H1 µ3 = {1} and µ3(R) = {1}, we see from the cohomology exact sequence (3.1.18) that the natural map H1 B  H1 Z0 is bijective.

We consider the homomorphism

B  µ2, X(a, b, c)  a, Y (a, b, c)  a.

We have a short exact sequence

1  A  B  µ2  1.

It admits a splitting

-1  b1 = Y (-1, -1, 1)  B.

Indeed, b1 = b1 and b21 = 1. We have H1 µ2 = {[1], [-1]}. By Corollary 3.1.24(iv) we have

H1 B = (H1A)/µ2  (H1b1A)/µ2 .

We have H1A = 1, whence (H1A)/µ2 H1 C×tw = {[1], [-1]}. By Corollary

= 1. As 3.1.28(i)

above, we have b1A the group µ2 acts

trivially on 1  H1b1A.

Hence it acts on H1b1A with two orbits with representatives 1 and -1 = X(1, -1 - 1) in

Z1b1A. As above, we obtain that H1Z0 = {[1], [b1], [b2]}.

We see that Z0 is a 1-dimensional torus (so that H1Z0 = 1) and the component group is of order 3. By Proposition 3.3.16 it follows that H1Z0 = 1.

The elements hi satisfy the relations h31 = h22 = h33 = 1, h2h3h-2 1 = h23. Moreover, these elements are polycyclic generators, meaning that every element of the group can uniquely be written hi1hj2hk3 with 0  i  3, 0  j  1, 0  k  2.
The element h2 is of order 2 and fixed by . Hence by Lemma 3.2.6 we conclude that H1 = {[1], [h2]}.

with a3b3 = -1. The latter has three components as well. We have
X(a, b)X(a, b) = X(aa, bb) X(a, b)Y (a, b) = Y (aa, bb) Y (a, b)X(a, b) = Y (ab, ba) Y (a, b)Y (a, b) = X(ab, ba).

Lemma. H1Z0 = {1, [y1]}, where y1 = Y (i, i) with i2 = -1.

Proof. We set A = {X(a, b) | ab = 1},
We define a homomorphism

B = Z0,

C = µ6.

j : B  C, X(a, b)  ab, Y (a, b)  ab.

Then ker j = A. We have a short exact sequence

1  A --i B --j C  1

and the corresponding cohomology exact sequence

C -- H1A --i H1B --j H1C.

Since H1A = 1 (as A is a torus), we see that j-1[1] = {[1]}  H1B. Set c1 = -1  Z1(C)  C. We compute j-1[c1]. We lift c1 = -1 to y1 = Y (i, i)  B.
Then y1 · y1 = Y (i, i) · Y (-i, -i) = X(1, 1) = 1.
Thus y1  Z1B. We twist the exact sequence by y1. We have
X(a, a-1) = y1 · X(a¯, a¯-1)y1-1 = X(a¯-1, a¯). Thus y1A = C×tw. By Example 3.1.7(3),
H1y1A = H1 C×tw = {[1], [-1]}.

We compute the action of c1  (c1C) = C on [1]  H1 y1A. By Lemma 3.1.29 we have [1] · c1 = [y1-2] = [X(-1, -1)] = [1].
We see that C acts nontrivially on H1y1A, and thus it has exactly one orbit. We conclude that #j-1[c1] = {[1]}, j-1[c1] = {[y1]}. Thus H1Z0 = H1B = {[1], [y1]}, as required.

X(, a)Y (, b) = Y (, ab) Y (, b)X(, a) = Y (, 2a-1b) Y (, b)Y (, b) = X(, ()2b(b)-1).
Lemma. H1Z0 = {1, [y], [z]} where y = Y (-1, 1), z = Y (-1, -1).
Proof. We set A = {X(1, a) | a  C×} and B = Z0. We have a short exact sequence 1  A  B --j C  1.
where C = µ6 and the homomorphism j is defined by X(, a)  , Y (, b)  .
We write c = -1  C. Then c = j(y) and y  Z1B, y2 = 1. We have H1C = {[1], [c]}. Thus H1B = ker j  j-1[c]. We have C = {1, c}, (cC) = C = {1, c}.
The kernel ker j is the image of H1A which is 1. Thus ker j = {1}. By Corollary 3.1.23 j-1[c] = y(H1yA), where the map y is induced by the map
t  ty : Z1yA  Z1B, and the map y in turn induces a bijection of the set of orbits H1yA/(cC) with j-1[c].
We have yX(1, a)y-1 = X(1, a¯-1). Hence by Example 3.1.7(3) we see that #H1yA = 2, H1yA = {1, [X(1, -1)]}.
Since y2 = 1, by Lemma 3.1.29 the element c  (cC) = C acts trivially on [1]  H1yA. It follows that the group (cC) acts trivially on H1yA. By Corollary 3.1.23 the map
y : H1yA  j-1[c] is bijective. Thus
#j-1[c] = 2, j-1[c] = {y[1], y[X(1, -1)]} = {[y], [z]}, where
z = X(1, -1) · y = X(1, -1) · Y (-1, 1) = Y (-1, -1). We conclude that H1B = {1, [y], [z]}, as required.
Alternatively, this case can be treated using Corollary 3.1.24(iv), similarly to Case 15.

Lemma. H1Z0 = {1, [y]} where y = Y (i, 1).

Proof. Set B = Z0 and T = B0 = {X(a, 1) | a  C×}, C = B/T.
We have a short exact sequence
1  T  B --j C  1. Then C is a finite abelian group of order 6. By Lemma 3.2.6 we have #H1C = {[1], [c]} where c  C is the unique element of order 2. A calculation shows that c = Y (1, 1) · T  B/T = C.
We have H1B = j-1[1]  j-1[c).
Since H1T = 1, we see that j-1[1] = {[1B]}. Write y = Y (i, 1), where i2 = -1. Then y · y = Y (i, 1) · Y (-i, 1) = X(1, 1) = 1.
Thus y  Z1B. Clearly, j(y) = c. By Corollary 3.1.23 the set j-1([c]) is in bijection to H1yT /(cC) = H1yT /C. We have C = {1, c},
X(a, 1) = y · X(a, 1)y-1 = X(a¯, 1), whence yT = C×tw and H1yT = {[1], [X(-1, 1)]}. We compute the action of c on 1  H1yT . By Lemma 3.1.29, [1] · c = [y2] = [X(-1, 1)] = [1]. Thus C has one orbit on H1yT , and therefore j-1([c]) = {[y]}. We conclude that H1B = {[1], [Y (i, 1)]}.

Set T = {X(a) | a  C×}, C = {1, Y (1)}.
Then it is clear that T and C are -invariant subgroups and that Z0 = T × C (direct product). We have H1T = {1} and
H1Z0 = H1T × H1C = H1C = {[1], [y]}, where y = Y (1).

Lemma. We have #H1Z0 = {1, [y1]} where y1 = Y (-1, 1, 1).

Proof. Write B = Z0 and consider the subgroup A = {X(a, b, c)} = {X((bc)-1, b, c)}.

Set C = µ2 = {±1} and consider the homomorphism

j : B  C, X(a, b, c)  1, Y (a, b, c)  -1.

Then A = ker j. Write c1 = -1  Z1C = C, and set y1 = Y (-1, 1, 1)  B. Then

j(y1) = c1, y¯1 = y1, y12 = 1, hence y1  Z1B. is surjective. We compute j-1[1] and j-1[c1].

It follows that the map j : H1B  H1C Since A = (C×st)2 we have H1A = 1, and

therefore, j-1[1] = {[1]}. We twist the exact sequence

1ABC1

by the cocycle y1. We compute y1A. A calculation shows that X(a, b, c) = Y (-1, 1, 1) · X(a¯, ¯b, c¯) · Y (-1, 1, 1)-1 = X(a¯, c¯, ¯b).

It follows that y1A  (C×)2tw+ . By Example 3.1.7(5) we have H1y1A = 1. Thus j-1[1] = {[y1]}. We conclude that H1B = {[1], [y1]}, as required

Here a is the image of the transposition (1, 2) and b is the image of the 5-cycle (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) with respect to an isomorphism S5  H.
We note that H1Z0 = H1H. Since H consists of real matrices, the nontrivial cohomology classes coincide with the conjugacy classes of elements of order 2. There are 2 such classes, one with representative (1, 2), the other with representative (1, 2)(3, 4). We conclude that H1Z0 = {[1], [a], [c]}, where c = b-2ab2a.

Y (a, b)Y (a, b) = X(-a-1b-1a, bb).

Lemma. H1Z0 = {[1], [y]} with y = Y (1, -1).

TRIVECTORS IN R9

Proof. We write B = Z0 and set y = Y (1, -1). Then y  B and y2 = 1; hence, y  Z1B. We have
y · X(a, b) · y-1 = Y (1, -1) · X(a, b) · Y (1, -1) = Y (a, -b) · Y (1, -1) = X(a-1b-1, b).

We introduce new parameters c, d  C× by a = c-1, b = cd. We write U (c, d) = X(a, b) = X(c-1, cd).

Then

y · U (c, d) · y-1 = y · X(c-1, cd)y-1 = X(d-1, cd) = U (d, c).

Let T denote the identity component of B. Then T is a 2-dimensional torus, whence H1T = 1. We consider yT . We have
U (c, d) = U (d, c).

By Example 3.1.7(5) we have H1yT = 1.
Set C = B/T . Then C = {1, c}, where c = yT . We have H1C = {1, [c]}. Consider the surjective homomorphism j : B  C. Then ker[j : H1B  H1C] is the image of H1T = {1} (Proposition 3.1.16). We conclude that ker j = {[1]}. Similarly, the fiber j-1[c] corresponds bijectively to H1yT = {1} (Corollary 3.1.23), and hence contains only one element. We conclude that j-1[c] = {[y]}. Thus H1B = {[1], [y]}, as required.

Since  acts trivially on C, by definition we have
H1C = C2/conjugation, where C2 denote the set of elements of order dividing 2 in C. Thus H1C = {[1], [c1]}, where c1 is the image of h1 in C.
We have a short exact sequence
1  T -- Z0 --j C  1,
where j is the canonical epimorphism. We obtain that
H1Z0 = j-1[1]  j-1[c1]. Now j-1[1] is the image of H1T = 1 (Proposition 3.1.16). Thus j-1[1] = {[1]}. Similarly, j-1[c1] corresponds bijectively to (H1h1T )/(h1C) (Corollary 3.1.23). We have
h21 = 1 and h1X(a)h-1 1 = X(a). Thus
h1T = T and H1h1T = H1T = 1. We see that j-1[c1] = {[h1]} and conclude that
H1Z0 = {[1], [h1]}.

The element h3 is real and of order 2, in particular it is a cocycle. Furthermore,

()

hX(a, b, c, d)h-1 = X(a, 2b, c, d).

Lemma. H1Z0 = {[1], [h3]}.

Proof. Write A = Z0, B = Z0, C = B/A. Then C is cyclic of order 6 and H1C = {[1], [h3]}. Also we have the short exact sequence

1  A -- B --j C  1.

Then H1B A = SL(2,

= j-1[1]  C). Hence

j-1[h3]. j-1[1] =

Firstly, {[1]}.

j-1[1]

is

the

image

of

H1A,

which

is

trivial

because

For the second set we twist the exact sequence by h3 and obtain

1  h3A -- h3B --j h3C  1. There is a canonical bijection from j-1[h3] to the set of orbits of h3C on H1h3A (Corollary 3.1.23). But from () it follows that h3A is a split form of SL(2, C), and hence it is isomorphic to SL(2, C) with the standard -action. It follows that H1h3A = 1. Therefore j-1[h3] = {[h3]}.

diag(a-1b-1, a-3b-2, a4b3, a2b2, a, a-1b-1, a-3b-2, a, b).

So it is a 2-dimensional torus, hence H1Z0 = 1.

which has trivial cohomology as well. So by Corollary 3.1.19 we conclude that H1Z0 = 1.

We have

We set h1 = h · X(-1, 1). Then

h21 = 1, h1 X(a, b)h-1 1 = X(a, a-1b-1). In particular, h1 is a cocycle with image c1 in C. We have H1Z0 = 1, hence ker j = {[1]}, where j : Z0  C is the canonical epimorphism. Let T (s, t) denote the torus in Example 3.1.7(5). Then T (s, t) = T (t¯, s¯). Define  : h1Z0  T by  (X(a, b)) = T (b, a-1b-1). Then  is a -equivariant isomorphism. It follows that H1h1Z0 = 1 and j-1[c1] = {[h1]}. By Corollary 3.1.23 we conclude that H1Z0 = {[1], [h1]}. 48 Representative: e136 - e245 - e378 + e478 + e579 + e679.

We have j(Z0(R)) = GL(2, R)+, the subgroup of GL(2, R) consisting of matrices with positive determinant. Since GL(2, R)+ is a subgroup of index 2 in GL(2, R), and #H1µ2 = 2, we see that the map  is surjective, whence ker j = 1, and we obtain that H1Z0 = 1.

where w is the image of the matrix

in the direct factor of Z0 that is isomorphic

to PSL(2, C). Let h, e, f be the standard generators of sl(2, C); then the matrix above is

exp(e) exp(-f ) exp(e). Let h2, e2, f2 be the standard generators of the direct summand of z0 that is the Lie algebra of the direct factor of Z0 isomorphic to PSL(2, C). Then w = exp(e2) exp(-f2) exp(e2).

The natural 9dimensional z0-module splits as a direct sum of two modules V1, V8 of dimensions 1 and 8. Here V1 is the trivial representation and V8 is the adjoint representation, that is, we may identify V8 with z0. Let N denote the normalizer of z0 in SL(9, C). Then we have a natural homomorphism

 : N  Aut(z0).

Set

A = {diag(v-8, v, v, v, v, v, v, v, v) | v  C×}.

Then it follows from Schur's lemma that ker  = A. Thus we have a short exact sequence

1  A -- N -- Aut(z0)  1,

which admits a canonical splitting

Thus

Aut(z0)  GL(z0) = GL(V8)  SL(9, C). N = A × Aut(z0).

It is known that Aut(z0) = Aut(sl3) fits into a short exact sequence
1  Inn(sl3)  Aut(sl3)  Out(sl3)  1,
where Inn(sl3) = PSL(3, C) and Out(sl3) is a group of order two, whose nontrivial element lifts to the involution X  -XT of sl3.
Let N1 denote the preimage of Inn(sl3) in N , and set B1 = B  N1. Set A1 = A  B1. A computer calculation shows that
A1 = {diag(, . . . , ), 3 = 1}.
It is easy to show that

B1 = A1 × Inn(sl3) = A1 × PSL(3, C).

which satisfies b2 = 1. We conclude that Z0 = µ3 × Aut(sl3), and hence H1Z0 = H1Aut(sl3). Now H1Aut(sl3)
classifies real forms of sl3. There are three of them: g(01) = sl(3, R), g(02) = su(2, 1), and g(03) = su(3). Thus #H1 = 3 in this case. For explicit cocycles we can take real elements b1, b2, b3  B such that b2i = 1 for i = 1, 2, 3 and
{y  z0 | Adbi (y¯) = y}  g(0i) .

Clearly, we can take b1 = 1, b2 = b. Consider the outer automorphism

X : z0  z0, e1  -f1, e2  -f2, h1  -h1, h2  -h2 .

Then {y  sl3 | X(y¯) = y} = su(3).

Then b is real and of order 2, so we can take b3 = b. 58 Representative: e137 - e246 - e345 + e479 + e569 - e578. Here Z0 consists of
diag(s-1t-4, s-1t2, st3, t-2, s-1t-1, s, t, s, t), where s, t  C×.

Hence Z0 is a 2-dimensional torus. Therefore H1Z0 = 1.
59 Representative: e147 + e156 - e237 - e246 + e368 + e579. The Lie algebra of Z0 is isomorphic to A1 + T1. Let s denote the semisimple part of z0. The natural 9-dimensional s-module splits as a direct sum of irreducible modules of dimensions 2, 3, 4 with bases {v6, v7}, {v3, v4, v5}, {v1, v2, v8, v9} respectively. Hence the connected subgroup S of Z0 with Lie algebra s is isomorphic to SL(2, C).
The Gro¨bner basis of the ideal generated by the defining polynomials of Z0 is difficult to compute. However, by adding equations it is easy to check that the elements of Z0 that act as the identity on s form the 1-dimensional connected torus consisting of

T (a) = (a, a, a-2, a-2, a-2, a, a, a, a), for a  C×.

We denote this torus by T . Since s has no outer automorphisms it follows that Z0 is connected and equal to ST . We have that Z0 = GL(2, C). Hence H1Z0 = 1.

Lemma. H1Z0 = {[1], [p], [p]}.

Proof. We write B = Z0 and

G=

Then G = GL(2, C). We set C = B/G. Then C  µ6 over R, that is, #C = 6, C is

generated by qG, and qG = q-1 G. Thus Z1C = C, B1(, C) = C2, and

H1C = C/C2 = Z/2Z

with generator c = pG = pG.

We have a short exact sequence

We write

S=

xy zt

| xt - yz = 1

.

Then S = SL(2, C). We set B1 = B/S, T = G/S = C×. We have a short exact sequence

1  T -- B1 -- C  1.

We compute H1B1. We have

H1B1 = -1[1]  -1[c].

where c = pG  Z1C = C. Since H1T = 1, we have -1[1] = {[1]}. We compute -1[c] by twisting the short exact sequence by c = pG  Z1C = C. We
can lift the cocycle c to the cocycle pS in B1. We twist the exact sequence by pS.

It follows that the -action in cT is tS  t¯-1S.

Thus (cT )(R)  C×tw and by Example 3.1.7(3) we have H1C×tw = {[1], [-1]}; hence #H1cT = 2.
We consider the right action of the group (cC)(R) = C(R) = {1, c} on H1cT ; see Construction 3.1.20. Since c  (cC)(R), c2 = 1, c = pS, and pS  Z1B1, by Lemma 3.1.29 we have
[1] · c = [(p)-2S] = [1]  H1cT
(because (p)-2  S). We conclude that C(R) acts trivially on H1cT . We consider

X

01 10

· S  Z1cT,

which is not cohomologous to 1, and

p = X

01 10

· p;

then p · p = 1, that is, p  Z1B. Since C(R) acts trivially on H1cT , by Corollary 3.1.23 the cocycles pS and pS are not cohomologous in Z1B1 and we have #-1[c] = 2 with cocycles [pS] and [pS]. Thus #H1B1 = 3 with cocycles [1], [pS], [pS].
We proceed to compute H1B. We have a short exact sequence

1  S -- B -- B1  1.

We see that H1B = - 1[1]  - 1[pS]  - 1[pS].
We compute these three sets. The set - 1[1] comes from H1S. Since S = SL(2, C) (-equivariantly), we have H1S = 1,
and hence, - 1[1] = [1]. The set - 1[pS] comes from H1pS. Consider the subgroup

One can easily check that p · s · (p)-1 = s.
It follows that the group (pS)(R) contains a closed subgroup isomorphic to R×. We see that (pS)(R) is not compact, and therefore, isomorphic to SL(2, R). We conclude that H1pS = 1, and hence #- 1[pS] = 1 with cocycle p.
The set - 1[pS] comes from H1pS and is in a canonical bijection with the set of orbits H1pS/(pB1)(R). We compute (pS)(R). For

s=X

xy zt

with xt - yz = 1,

we have Hence, the condition

p · s¯ · (p)-1 = X

t¯ -z¯ -y¯ x¯

.

p · s¯ · (p)-1 = s

gives t = x¯ and z = -y¯. It follows that

(pS)(R) =

We see that (p S)(R)  SU(2), and hence #H1pS = 2 with cocycles 1 and X

-1 0 0 -1

;

see [Serre1997, Section III.4.5, Examples].

We compute the orbits of the action of (pB1)(R) on H1pS. Since

p · (p)-1 = X

-1 0 0 -1

and

(p)2 = X

-1 0 0 -1

,

we have pS  B1(R) and (pS)2 = 1. We compute [1] · pS  H1pS. By Lemma 3.1.29 it is the class of the cocycle

(p)-2 = X

-1 0 0 -1

.

We see that the group (p B1)(R) acts on H1pS transitively. It follows that #- 1[pS] = 1 and - 1[pS] = {[p]}. Thus H1B = {[1], [p], [p]}, as required.

We consider the natural 9-dimensional s-module. It splits into a direct sum of three irreducible modules of dimensions 5, 3, 1 (of highest weights 4,2,0). The centralizer in Z0 of s is a 1-dimensional torus T1 consisting of diag(a-2, a-2, a, a, a, a, a, a, a-2) for a  C×, which is exactly the connected torus with Lie algebra t1. Let S be the connected subgroup of Z0 with Lie algebra s, then S  T1 = {1} (this follows because one of the summands of the s-module is trivial). Since s has no outer automorphisms this implies that Z0 is isomorphic to PSL(2, C) × T1. (Since the weight lattice in this case is equal to the root lattice.)
Since PSL(2, C) = Aut(sl(2, C)), the set H1PSL(2, C) is in a bijection with the set of isomorphism classes of real forms of sl(2, C). There two nonisomorphic real forms, sl(2, R) and su(2). Thus #H1PSL(2, C) = 2.
For explicit cocycles we can take 1 and the image b in PSL(2, C) of the matrix

Note that this image is real and of order 2, hence a cocycle.

()

hX(u, v, x, y; b)h-1 = X(u, v, x, y; b-1(uy - vx)).

Lemma. H1Z0 = {[1], [h]}.

Proof. Write A = Z0, B = Z0, C = B/A = {[1], [c]}. We have a short exact sequence 1  A -- B --j C  1,

where j is the canonical epimorphism. We have H1C = {[1], [c]} and hence H1B = ker j  j-1[c].
Since A is isomorphic to GL(2, C) × GL(1, C), we have H1A = 1, so that ker j = {[1]}.
The fiber j-1[c] is in a canonical bijection with the image of H1hA (Corollary 3.1.23). In order to compute this set we first construct a -equivariant surjective homomorphism

 : A  (C×)2, X(u, v, x, y; b)  ((uy - vx)-1, b).

We write T = (C×)2. Then we have a short exact sequence

1  H -- A -- T  1, where H = SL(2, C). We twist this sequence to get the short exact sequence

1  hH  hA  hT  1.

It follows from () that hH = H, and therefore H1hH = 1.

The conjugation on hT is given by (a, b)  (a, a-1b-1), hence it acts on X(T ) = Z2

by the matrix

10 -1 -1

.

This matrix

permutes the two

vectors

constituting

a basis of Z2. It follows that hT is a quasi-trivial torus, and by Proposition 3.5.8 we have

H1hT = 1. We see that H1hA = 1 and thus j-1[c] has only one element, namely, [h]. This

concludes the proof.

gives rise to a cohomology exact sequence

Z0(R) --j GL(2, R) -- H1µ4 --i H1Z0 --j H1GL(2, C) = 1.
The image of the homomorphism j : Z0(R)  GL(2, R) is the group GL(2, R)+ consisting of matrices with positive determinant. Since GL(2, R)+ is a subgroup of index 2 in GL(2, R), we see that the image of  is a subgroup of order 2 in H1µ4. However, H1µ4 is a group of order 2, and therefore the connecting homomorphism  is surjective. It follows that
ker j : H1Z0  H1GL(2, C)) = {[1]}.
Taking into account that H1GL(2, C) = {1}, we conclude that H1Z0 = 1.

Thus P  B is a cocycle. We twist the above exact sequence by P . The complex conjugation on P T is given by

Clearly, c is the image of P in C. We have

P 2 = D(1, 1, i) · Q·D(1, 1, i) · Q-1 · Q2 =D(1, 1, i) · D(1, 1, -i) · D(1, 1, -1) = D(1, 1, -1),

and hence, P -2 = D(1, 1, -1). By Lemma 3.1.29

[1] · c = [P -2] = [D(1, 1, -1)]  H1P T.
Thus C acts on H1P T nontrivially, and #j-1[c] = 1. We conclude that H1B = {[1], [P ]}, as required.

They satisfy the following relations:

Proof. Consider the central subgroup f0 of order 3 and set G = Z0/ f0 . By Lemma 3.2.3 the canonical epimorphism Z0  G induces a bijection H1Z0  H1 G.
We compute H1 G. Write T = Z0, which is a 2-dimensional torus. Set C = G/T , which is a finite group of order 6. Let h2 and h3 denote the images in G of f2 and f3, respectively. Then the images c2 of h2 and c3 of h3 in C generate C. We have
h33 = 1, h22 = 1, h2h3h-2 1 = h23 ,
whence c33 = 1, c22 = 1, c2c3c-2 1 = c23 .
It follows that C  S3. From the formula for f¯2 it follows that c¯2 = c2. Furthermore, obviously f¯3 = f3 so that c¯3 = c3. Hence  acts trivially on C. It follows that #H1 C = 2 and H1 C = {[1], [c2]}.
We have a short exact sequence

(6.0.3)

1  T -- G --j C  1.

Since H1 T = 1, we see that j-1[1] = {[1]}. We compute j-1[c2]. For this end we first show that f2 is a 1-cocycle. Indeed,

f2 · f¯2 = f2 D(i, 1) · f2f02 D(2, 1)D(-i2, 1) = f22 f02 · D(-i2, 1)D(2, 1)D(-i2, 1) = f0 f02 · D(-4, 1)D(2, 1) = f03 · D(-1, 1) = 1.

Let h2 denote the image of f2 in G. The image of h2 in C is c2. Now we twist the exact sequence (6.0.3) by h2. We have

f2 D(s, t)f2-1 = D(s-1t, t).

We see that  acts on X(h2T ) = Z2 by the matrix

-1 0 11

and preserves the basis

-1 1

of Z2. It follows that h2T is a quasi-trivial torus, and by Proposition 3.5.8 we have

H1 h2T = 1. Now from Corollary 3.1.23 it follows that #j-1[c2] = 1. We conclude that

#H1G = 2 and hence #H1Z0 = 2.

Since the image of f2 in C is c2 , it follows that H1Z0 = {1, [f2 ]}, as required.

· Q.

Proof. Set H = {X(A, 1, 1) | A  SL(2, C)}  Z0.
We see from the formulas that H is a normal subgroup of Z0. Set G = Z0/H. Write T = G, the identity component of G. Then T is a torus. Let t(a, b) denote the image of X(A, a, b) in T . Then the group {1, Q} acts on T by Q  t(a, b) = t(a, a2 b-1). We consider the twisted R-torus QT . Then  acts in QT by
t(a, b) = t(a¯, a¯2¯b-1).

We see that  acts on the cocharacter group X(QT ) = Z2 by the matrix M =

10 2 -1

.

The lattice X(QT ) has the basis v1 =

1 1

,

v2 =

such that M v1 = v1, M v2 = -v2. It

follows that H1 QT = {1, t(1, -1)}.

We compute the Galois cohomology of G = Z0/H. Set C = Z0/Z0 = G/T . Then C = {1, c}, where c is the image of Q in C. Clearly, we have H1 C = {[1], [c]}.

We have a short exact sequence 1  T  G -- C  1.

We see that H1G = -1[1]  -1[c].
Since H1 T = 1, we see that -1[1] = {[1]}. We compute -1[c]. It comes from H1 QT . By Corollary 3.1.23 -1[c] = H1QT /C. Since Q2 = 1, by Lemma 3.1.29 the element
c  C = C acts trivially on [1]  H1QT . Thus C acts trivially on H1QT . We conclude that #-1[c] = 2 and #H1G = 3. We write g = QG, the image of Q in G. Then
H1G = {[1], [g], [t(1, -1)g]}.

We compute the Galois cohomology of Z0. We have a short exact sequence
1  H  Z0 -- G  1. We show that the three cohomology classes [1], [g], [y]  H1G can be lifted to Z0. Indeed, the cocycle 1 lifts to 1, and the cocycle g lifts to Q  B. Moreover, it is clear that the cocycle y  Z1G is the image of the element

and an easy calculation shows that x is a cocycle.

For any cocycle b  Z1Z0, we have

see Corollary 3.1.23. We have H1H = {1}, and therefore, - 1[1] = {1}. Moreover, QH = H, hence H1QH = H1H = {1}, and therefore, - 1[g] contains only one class [Q]. Furthermore, xH  SU(2) and H1xH = {[1], [-1]}. We show below that H0(, xG) acts on H1xH nontrivially, hence transitively, and therefore, - 1([x]) contains only one class [x].

Write y = t(1, -1)g, where g = QG  G. We calculate: y = y · y¯ · y-1 = yyy-1 = y,

because the element y  G is real. Thus y  H0(, yG). We have

Lemma. H1Z0 = {[1], [g2]}.

Proof. Set T = Z0 = {D(s, t, u) | s, t, u  C×}.
We have a short exact sequence
1  T  Z0 -- S3  1.
The group  acts trivially on S3 , whence
H1S3 = {[1], [g¯2]},
where g¯2 = g2T  S3 . The cocycle g¯2  Z1S3 is the image of the cocycle g2  Z1Z0. We have
H1Z0 = - 1[1]  - 1[g¯2]. Since H1T = 1, we see that - 1[1] contains only one class [1].
We compute - 1[g¯2]. By Corollary 3.1.23 there is a bijection between - 1[g¯2] and the set of orbits of (g¯2S3) on H1g2 T .
We compute H1g2T . The conjugation on g2T is given by
D(s, t, u)  D(s-1tu, t, u).
Hence H1g2T = 1. Thus - 1[g¯2] contains only one class [g2]. We conclude that H1Z0 = {[1], [g2]}, as
required.

Proof. We have a short exact sequence 1  Z0 -- Z0 -- C  1.
Clearly H1C = {[1], [c]}. We have that -1[1]  H1Z0 is the image of H1Z0. As the latter is trivial we see that -1[1] = {[1]}. We compute -1[c]  H1Z0. It comes from H1QZ0. Now QZ0  RC/RGL(2, C), and by Proposition 3.4.4 we have H1QZ0 = 1. Thus -1[c] = {[Q]}  H1Z0. We see that H1Z0 = {[1], [Q]}, as required.

Proof. Clearly, H1Z0 = H1G. We have a short exact sequence
1  A -- G -- C  1.
Because  acts trivially on C we have H1C = {1, [c]}, where c is the image in C of the real matrix P . We compute -1[1]  H1G. Since H1A = 1, Corollary 3.1.22 shows that -1[1] = {[1]}. We compute -1[c]  H1G. For that we twist the exact sequence by P . We have that P A  SL2,R × RC/RSL2,C, and by Proposition 3.4.4 we have H1P A = 1. So by Corollary 3.1.23 we conclude that -1[c] = {[P ]}  H1G. We see that H1B = H1G = {[1], [P ]}, as required.

Lemma. H1Z0 = {[1], [a]}.

Proof. We write

T = {D(s)},

S = X( , , ) , a11 a13 a31 a33

a22 a24 a42 a44

a55 a59 a95 a99

G = T · S  Z0.

Then T  S = {D(±1)}. The subgroup G is normal in Z0; we set C = Z0/G. We have a short exact sequence
1  G -- Z0 -- C  1.

We compute H1C. Since C is of order 6, we conclude that #H1C = 2 with cocycles [1] and [aG] (Lemma 3.2.6; note that a2 = 1, a = a). Thus

H1Z0 = -1[1]  -1[aG].

We compute H1G. We have G = T · S. We obtain a short exact sequence

1  S  G  T  1,
where T = G/S = T /(T  S). We have H1S = 1. Since T is a one-dimensional torus, we have H1 T = 1. We see that H1G = 1. Hence by Corollary 3.1.22 we conclude that -1[1] = {[1]}.
We compute -1[aG]  H1Z0. Note that a2 = 1 and a is real. It follows that a is a cocycle in Z0. Consider the twisted group
aG = aT · aS,
where aT = T because T is central in Z0. We obtain a short exact sequence
1  aS  aG  aT  1,
where aT = T . The group (aS)(R) is isomorphic to SL(2, C) × SL(2, R). It follows that H1aS = 1. Since also H1 T = 1, we see that H1aG = 1. Using Corollary 3.1.23, we conclude that #-1[aG] = [a] .
It follows that H1Z0 = {[1], [a]}, as required.

with 3 = 1, a54a91+a55a99 = 2. So the identity component is isomorphic to SL(2, C)×T1. The component group is isomorphic to µ3. So using Corollary 3.1.19 we see that H1Z0 = 1.

So each matrix in the identity component is block diagonal with 3 × 3-blocks on the diagonal. The bases of the three submodules are {v1, v8, v9}, {v2, v3, v4} and {v5, v6, v7} (where v1, . . . , v9 is the standard basis of the natural 9-dimensional module). The component group is of order 3 and is generated by

a = diag(, 7, 7, 7, 4, 4, 4, , ),

where  is a primitive ninth root of unity. So a3  Z0. By Corollary 3.1.19 we see that H1Z0 = 1.

83 Representative: e157 - e247 - e256 - e346 + e458 + e679. Here Z0 is of type B2. The matrices in this component decompose into a 4 × 4 - and a 5×5-block, corresponding to the 4- and 5-dimensional irreducible representations. The Lie algebra of type B2 has no outer automorphisms, so any other component of Z0 has to have elements that commute with all elements of the Lie algebra. Adding the corresponding
equations to the original ones we find that the elements that commute with the Lie algebra form a finite group of six elements, consisting of diag(u, u, u, v, v, v, v, u, u) with u3 = 1 and v = ±u. The group of diagonal matrices contained in Z0 can be computed by adding the equations expressing that a matrix is diagonal to the original equations. It turns out
that this group is

diag(2s-2t-1, 2, 2s2t, s-1, st, s-1t-1, s, t-1, t),

where 3 = 1. This is not connected so Z0 is not connected either (because a maximal torus of a connected semisimple algebraic group is connected as well). But by the above computation all components of Z0 have a representative lying in the diagonal part. Hence Z0 = µ3 × Z0, and Z0 is isomorphic to Sp(4, C). Since H1 Sp(4, C) = 1 and H1µ3 = 1, we infer by Corollary 3.1.19 that H1Z0 = 1.

The Lie algebra of Z0 is isomorphic to s + t1, where s is isomorphic to sl(2, C) + sl(2, C) and t1 denotes a 1-dimensional center consisting of diagonal matrices. In this case it is possible to compute the Gro¨bner basis and even to do a primary decomposition of the corresponding ideal. The latter shows that the group is connected (the ideal is prime). The natural 9-dimensional module splits as direct sum of four irreducible submodules of dimensions 1, 2, 2, 4 with highest weights (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1). Let S be the connected algebraic subgroup of Z0 with Lie algebra s. Then the module decomposition shows that S  SL(2, C) × SL(2, C). Let T1 be the connected subgroup of Z0 with Lie algebra t1. Then the intersection of T1 and the diagonal maximal torus of S consists just of 1. This implies that Z0 is isomorphic to SL(2, C) × SL(2, C) × C×. Hence H1Z0 = 1.

Lemma. H1Z0 = {[1], [P ]} where P = (w, w) · Q with w =

Proof. We have a short exact sequence 1  Z0  Z0 -- µ2  1, (g1, g2) · Qm - (-1)m,
whence a cohomology exact sequence H1Z0  H1Z0  H1µ2 = {[1], [-1]}.
Since H1Z0 = 1, we see that the preimage in H1Z0 of [1]  H1µ2 is only one class [1]  H1Z0.
We compute the preimage in H1Z0 of [-1]  H1µ2. We have Q2 = (-1, -1) so that P 2 = (1, 1); thus P is a 1-cocycle lifting [-1]  H1µ2. We have a short exact sequence
1  P Z0  P Z0  µ2  1, (g1, g2) · P m - (-1)m. We wish to compute H1P Z0. We have P Z0  RC/RGL(2, C), and by Proposition 3.4.4, H1P Z0 = 1. Thus -1([-1]) = [P ], which completes the proof.

89 Representative: e157 - e237 - e456 + e478 + e679. Here Z0 is of type A1 + A2. It consists of matrices that decompose into two 3 × 3-blocks, a 2 × 2-block and a 1 × 1-block. The two 3 × 3-blocks correspond to two dual representations of SL(3, C), the 2 × 2-block is a copy of SL(2, C), in the 1 × 1-block there simply is 1. The component group is isomorphic to µ3. So Z0 = µ3 × SL(2, C) × SL(3, C). Hence H1Z0 = 1.
90 Representative: e147 + e156 - e237 - e246 - e345. Rank 7, Gurevich number X. Here Z0 is semisimple of type G2 + A1. The matrices in the centralizer have a 7 × 7-block for G2 and a 2 × 2-block for A1. The centralizer of the Lie algebra z0 of Z0 consists of
diag(t4, t4, t4, t4, t4, t4, t4, t, t)

with t6 = 1. The elements with t = 1, t = -1 lie in the identity component, the others do not. So Z0  G2(C) × SL(2, C) × µ3.
Since the H1 is trivial for SL2 and µ3, it suffices to compute H1G2. It is known that #H1 = 2 (because G2 has exactly two real forms: the split one and the compact one). We explain how to find explicit cocycles.

Let G = G2, T  G be a split torus, R = R(G, T )  X(T ) denote the root system,  = {l, s} be a system of simple roots in R, where l is a long root and s is a short root. Then  is a basis of X(T ). Let t  T be the element such that

l(t) = -1, s(t) = 1.
Then t is real, t2 = 1, so t is a cocycle. It is cohomologous to 1, because it is contained in the split torus T .
Now let T   G be an anisotropic maximal torus defined over R, that is, T   G is defined over R and T (R)  U (1) × U (1).
We can find g  G such that gT g-1 = T . Set t = gtg-1  T (C)2 = T (R)2. By Borovoi and Timashev [BT2021, Theorem 13.3], 1, t are explicit cocycles for G = G2.

92 Representative: e157 - e247 - e356 + e679. Rank 8, Gurevich number XI. The Lie algebra of Z0 is isomorphic to sl(2, C) + sl(2, C) + t2, where the last summand denotes the 2-dimensional center. Computing the primary decomposition of the defining
ideal shows that Z0 is connected. The natural 9-dimensional module splits as direct sum of six irreducible submodules of dimensions 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2. Looking at the torus with Lie algebra t2 it is seen that Z0 is isomorphic to GL(2, C) × GL(2, C). So H1Z0 = 1.
93 Representative: e157 - e247 - e256 - e346. Rank 7, Gurevich number IX. The Lie algebra of Z0 is isomorphic to sl(2, C) + sl(2, C) + sl(2, C) + t1, where the last summand denotes the 1-dimensional center. The Gro¨bner basis is difficult to compute.
However, by adding equations it is easy to check that the elements of Z0 map the summands isomorphic to sl(2, C) in the Lie algebra to themselves. Secondly, the elements of
Z0 that act as the identity on the semisimple part form a 1-dimensional not connected diagonal group, which we denote U . The diagonal matrices in Z0 form a connected 4dimensional torus containing U . Therefore Z0 is connected.

The group Z0 is the image of Z0 = G1 × G2 × G3 × T1, where each Gi is SL(2, C) and T1 = C×, under the 9-dimensional representation

 : Z0  GL(V9),

where the 9-dimensional Z0-module V9 splits as a direct sum of 3 modules

V9 = V3  V4  V2

of dimensions 3, 4, 2, with highest weights (2, 0, 0, -2), (1, 1, 0, 1), (0, 0, 1, 1), respectively. It is easy to see that ker  is a group of order 4, namely,

ker  = {1, (-1, -1, 1, 1), (1, -1, -1, -1), (-1, 1, -1, -1)}.

Lemma. We have #H1Z0 = 2 with cocycles

1 and (w, w, 1, 1),

where w =

01 -1 0

 SL(2, C).

Proof. We write that we have Z0ss

Z=0ss(=G[1Z×0,GZ20]×=1

(G1 × 1)

× G2 × G3,

× G3 × 1). and H1G3

First we compute H1Z0ss. = 1. Thus the embedding

Note

(G1 × G2 × 1 × 1)  Z0ss

induces a bijection on H1. Therefore, it suffices to compute the H1 of (G1 × G2), where we write (G1 × G2) for (G1 × G2 × 1 × 1). One can compute the H1 by the method of

Borovoi and Timashev [BT2021, Theorem 13.3]. Here we explain the answer elementarily.

It suffices to compute the H1 of G = (G1 × G2)/µ2, where Gi = SL(2, C). Consider G1 and the compact maximal torus

T1 =

, cos  sin 
- sin  cos 

R .

We set T = (T1 × T2)/µ2  G. It is known (see [Borovoi1988, Theorem 1] or [Borovoi2014, Theorem 9]) that H1G comes from T (R)2. Let   T (R)2; then  comes from (wn1, wn2 )  T1 × T2, where n1, n2  {0, 1, 2, 3}.
Note that the cocycles (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1) of G come from cocycles of G1 × G2. Since H1(G1 × G2) = 1, we see that these three cocycles are coboundaries in G1 × G2, and therefore, they are coboundaries in G. This we have 5 cocycles:

1, (w, w), (w, -w), (-w, w), (-w, -w).

Since (-w, -w) = (w, w) and (w, -w) = (-w, w), we have three different cocycles: 1, (w, w), (w, -w) in G. Thus

H1G = {1, [(w, w)], [(w, -w)]}.

94

MIKHAIL BOROVOI, WILLEM DE GRAAF, AND HO^ NG VA^ N LE^

One can show that these three cohomology classes in G are pairwise different, but we shall not need that.
We consider the embedding G  G × SL(2, C). Since H1SL(2, C) = 1, this embedding induces a bijection on H1.
Write Z123 = (G1 × G2 × G3 × 1) = G × G3. We have a short exact sequence 1  Z123  Z0  C×  1.
Since H1C× = 1, we see that the embedding
G  Z123  Z0 induces a surjection on H1. Thus
H1Z0 = {1, [(w, w)], [(w, -w)]},
but maybe some of these cohomology classes coincide.
We show that (w, w) and (w, -w) are equivalent in Z0. Indeed, consider b = (1, 1, i, i)  Z0. Then
b-1 · (w, w) · ¯b := b-1 · (w, w, 1, 1) · ¯b = (w, w, -1, -1) = (w, -w, 1, 1) = (w, -w),
as required.
Write a = (w, w)  Z0. We show that a  1. We consider the short exact sequence 1  ker  -- Z0 -- Z0  1
and the coboundary [a] = aa¯ = (w2, w2, 1, 1) = (-1, -1, 1, 1)  ker  = H2 ker .
Since [a] = 1, we conclude that [a] = 1  H1Z0. Thus #H1Z0 = 2 with cocycles [1] and a = (w, w, 1, 1), as required.

We have Q2 = 1 and QX(A, B, C)Q = X(B, A, C). Lemma. H1Z0 = {[1], [Q]}.

Proof. We have Z0 = Z0  {1, Q}. Moreover, Z0 = ker[GL(2, C) × GL(2, C) × GL(2, C)  C×], Consider the surjective homomorphism

(A, B, C)  det(A) det(B) det(C).

 : Z0  GL(2, C) × GL(2, C), (A, B, C)  (A, B) with kernel SL(2, C). From the short exact sequence

1  SL(2, C)  Z0 -- GL(2, C) × GL(2, C)  1 we see that H1Z0 = 1. From the short exact sequence
1  SL(2, C)  QZ0 -- RC/RGL(2, C)  1 we see that H1 QZ0 = 1. Let  : Z0  Z0/Z0 = µ2 denote the canonical homomorphism. We see that
H1Z0 = ker   -1[Q] = {1, [Q]}, as required.

95 Representative: e167 - e257 - e347 - e456. Rank 7, Gurevich number VII. In this case we can compute the primary decomposition of the ideal generated by the
defining polynomials, and it shows that the centralizer is connected. The Lie algebra of Z0 is equal to s + t1, where the second summand denotes the 1-dimensional center and s  sl(2, C) + sl(3, C). The natural 9-dimensional module has basis v1, . . . , v9. As s-module it splits as direct sum of two 3-dimensional modules (with bases {v1, v2, v3}, {v4, v5, v6} respectively), a 1-dimensional module with basis {v7} and a 2-dimensional module with basis {v8, v9}. Let S denote the connected algebraic subgroup of Z0 with Lie algebra s. Then the matrices in S are block diagonal with first two 3×-blocks, containing two dual representations of SL(3, C), then a 1 × 1-block containing 1, and finally a 2×-
block containing the natural representation of SL(2, C). Let T be the connected algebraic subgroup with Lie algebra t1. Then T consists of diag(t, t, t, 1, 1, 1, t-1, t-1, t-1) for t  C×. Hence the product is direct and Z0  SL(3, C) × SL(2, C) × T1, so that H1Z0 = 1.

(with the determinants of the submatrices equal to 1). It is straightforward to obtain this from the Lie algebra. The component group is determined with the method of Example 5.1.1(2). Here the diagram automorphism group of the Lie algebra has order 48. For each element of that group we have added the equations that express that an element of the centralizer permutes the Chevalley generators in the way prescribed by the chosen outer automorphism. For most diagram automorphisms this gave no elements in the centralizer, except for the identity (which yielded elements already in the identity component) and

that thus generates the component group. We have Q2 = 1 and QX(A, B, C)Q = X(A, C, B).

Lemma. H1Z0 = {[1], [Q]}.

Proof. Note that Q is a 1-cocycle in Z0. Let C = Z0/Z0 = {¯1, Q¯}. Then H1C = {[¯1], [Q¯]}. Consider the natural homomorphism  : Z0  C; then
H1Z0 = ker   -1([Q¯]).
Since Z0  SL(2, C)3 we have H1Z0 = 1. Thus ker  = 1. Since QZ0  RC/RSL(2, C) × SL2(R) as a real algebraic group, we have H1QZ0 = 1. Thus by Corollary 3.1.23 #-1([Q¯]) = 1 and -1([Q¯]) = [Q]. Thus H1Z0 = {1, [Q]}, as required.

97 Representative: -e267 - e357 - e456. Rank 6, Gurevich number IV. By computing the primary decomposition of the defining ideal we see that the centralizer is connected. It is of type A2 + A2 + T1. The centralizer consists of block diagonal matrices, consisting of three 3 × 3-blocks. One block has a copy of SL(3, C). The other copy of SL(3, C) occupies the two other blocks (where the corresponding 3-dimensional representations are isomorphic). The intersection of T1 and the semisimple part is µ3, so the product is not direct. Let G = SL(3, C) × SL(3, C) × T1; then Z0  G/N , where N is of order 3. Hence by Lemma 3.2.3 there is a bijection between H1Z0 and H1G. As the latter is trivial, so is the former.
98 Representative: e167 - e257 - e347 - e789. The centralizer is of type C4. The matrices of the identity component consist of a 8 × 8block (containing Sp(8, C)) and a 1 × 1-block (containing just 1). There are no diagram automorphisms. Adding the equations expressing that an element commutes with the Lie algebra yields that the centralizer is not connected and isomorphic to Sp(4, C) × µ3. Thus H1Z0 = 1.
99 Representative: e167 - e257 - e347. Rank 7, Gurevich number VI. Here the Lie algebra of Z0 is z0 = s+ t1, where the latter denotes the 1-dimensional center. Furthermore, s is isomorphic to sp(6, C) + sl(2, C). Let S be the connected subgroup of Z0 with Lie algebra s. Then S consists of matrices that are block diagonal with first a 6 × 6-block, then a 1 × 1-block, then a 2 × 2-block. The 6 × 6-block contains the 6-dimensional irreducible representation of Sp(6, C) with highest weight (1, 0, 0). So in that block we have a copy of Sp(6, C). The 1 × 1-block just has 1. The 2 × 2-block has a copy of SL(2, C). Let T1 be the connected subgroup of Z0 with Lie algebra t1. Then T1 consists of diag(a, a, a, a, a, a, a-2, a-2, a-2). Its intersection with S consists of 1 and diag(-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1). Here there are no outer automorphisms, so each component has elements that commute with the Lie algebra. Adding the corresponding linear equations we find that the elements commuting with the Lie algebra form a diagonal group, contained in the identity component. Hence the centralizer is connected.

It follows that Z0  (Sp(6, C) × T1)/µ2 × SL(2, C).
We have that H1(Sp(6, C) × T1)/µ2 = 1, which follows from the short exact sequence
1  Sp(6, C)  (Sp(6, C) × T1)/µ2 -- C×  1,
where ((gij )) = g77. Hence H1Z0 = 1.
100 Representative: -e367 - e457. Rank 5, Gurevich number III. The Lie algebra of Z0 is isomorphic to s + t1, where the latter denotes the 1-dimensional center. Furthermore, s is isomorphic to sl(4, C) + sp(6, C). Let S denote the connected subgroup of Z0 with Lie algebra s. Then S consists of matrices that are block diagonal with two 4× 4-blocks and one 1× 1-block. The first 4× 4-block (occupying the entries (i, j) with i, j  {1, 2, 8, 9}) contains a copy of SL(4, C), the second one (occupying the entries (i, j) with i, j  {3, 4, 5, 6}) has a copy of Sp(4, C). The 1 × 1-block (in position (7, 7)) just has 1. Let T1 denote the connected subgroup of Z0 with Lie algebra t1. Then T1 consists of T1(a) = diag(a, a, a-2, a-2, a-2, a-2, a4, a, a). Its intersection with the semisimple part consists of T1(a) with a4 = 1. Here there is one diagram automorphism. But adding the corresponding equations gives that there is no element of the centralizer realizing that. Adding the equations expressing that an elements commutes with the Lie algebra yields a diagonal group, all of whose elements lie in S. It follows that the centralizer is connected.
We have a short exact sequence
1  SL(4, C) × Sp(4, C) -- Z0 -- C×  1,
where ((gij )) = g77. It follows that H1Z0 = 1.
101 Representative: -e567. Rank 3, Gurevich number II. The centralizer is isomorphic to SL(3, C) × SL(6, C). (The identity component is directly obtained from the Lie algebra; computations like in the previous cases show that the centralizer is connected.) Hence H1Z0 = 1.

7. The semisimple orbits In this section we identify the spaces gC1 and 3 C9 on which the group G0 = SL(9, C) acts. Similarly we identify g1 and 3 R9 on which the group SL(9, R) acts. 7.1. Summary of some results of Vinberg-Elashvili. In [VE1978] it is shown that

p1 = e123 + e456 + e789 p2 = e147 + e258 + e369 p3 = e159 + e267 + e348 p4 = e168 + e249 + e357
span a Cartan subspace in gC1. Throughout this section we will denote this Cartan subspace by C. As in Section 4.5 we denote the corresponding Weyl group by W . Also for p  C we define
Cp = {h  C | wh = h for all w  Wp} Cp = {q  Cp | Wq = Wp},
see (4.5.2), (4.5.3).
Let h be a Cartan subalgebra of gC containing C. It turns out that there is a unique such Cartan subalgebra and h = (h  gC-1)  C. Let  be the root system of gC with respect

98

MIKHAIL BOROVOI, WILLEM DE GRAAF, AND HO^ NG VA^ N LE^

to h. Let  denote the automorphism of gC corresponding to the given Z3-grading. Then h is -stable and we define a map  : h  h, (h) = (-1h) for  in the dual space h. We have 2 +  + 1 = 0 so that for    the set () = {±, ±(), ±2()} lies in a 2-dimensional space and forms a root subsystem of type A2. The () form a
partition of , hence there are 40 such sets. Note that for h  C and    we have that ()(h) = 2(h) (where  is a third root of unity such that (x) = x for all x  gC1). Hence the restrictions of the elements of () to C are proportional.

To each () a complex reflection w (of order 3) is associated, so we have 40 of those reflections. For the details we refer to [VE1978], where it is also shown that there exist p  C such that

(7.1.1)

w(h) = h - (h)p for h  C.

Furthermore, these are all complex reflections in W , and they form a single conjugacy class.
Let p  C and let Wp denote the stabilizer of p in W . It is known that Wp is generated by complex reflections ([Vinberg1976, Proposition 14]) so from (7.1.1) it follows that Wp is generated by the w such that (p) = 0.
As in Section 4.5 we define
Crpeg = {q  Cp | (q) = 0 for all    such that |Cp = 0}.
Let   . Then (p) = 0 if and only if w(p) = p if and only if w(q) = q for all q  Cp if and only if (q) = 0 for all q  Cp. It follows that Crpeg = Cp, which is a hypothesis for some of the results in Section 4.5. Hence all of these can be applied here.

7.2. Using Galois cohomology for finding real orbits in semisimple trivectors. Here we fix a p  C and write F = Cp. Let O = G0 · p denote the G0-orbit of p. We wish to know whether O contains an R-point and whether O  F contains an R-point. If O has a real point, we wish to classify real orbits in O.
Define

ZG0(F) = {g  G0 | gq = q for all q  F}, NG0(F) = {g  G0 | gq  F for all q  F}.
As in Section 4.5 we set p = NW (Wp)/Wp. Then from Lemma 4.5.12 we get a surjective group homomorphism  : NG0(F)  p with kernel ZG0(F). So  induces an isomorphism, which we also denote , between A = NG0(F)/ZG0 (F) and p. Furthermore for g  NG0(F) and q  F we have that gq = (g)q.
Proposition 7.2.1. As before let O = G0 · p. Write N = NG0(F), Z = ZG0(F).
(i) O has an R-point if and only if p = n-1 · p for some n  Z1N . (ii) Assume that O has an R-point and let n be as in (i). Write a = nZ  Z1A and
 = [a]  H1A. Then O has an R-point in F if and only if  = 1.

Proof. (i) Assume that O has an R-point pR = g · p. Then g · p = g · p, whence p = g-1 · g · p = (g-1g)-1 · p.

Write (7.2.2)

n = g-1g.

TRIVECTORS IN R9

99

Since p, p  F , we see that n  N by Lemma 4.5.11. It follows from (7.2.2) that n  Z1N .

Conversely, assume that p = n-1 · p, where n  Z1N . Since H1G0 = {1}, there exists g  G0 such that n = g-1g. Set
pR = g · p  O.

Then

pR = g · p = gn · n-1 · p = g · p = pR .

Thus pR is an R-point of O, which proves (i).

(ii) Assume that O has an R-point and let n be as in (i). We show that  depends only on O. First suppose that p = n^-1 · p for a n^  N . Then n^n-1  ZG0(p), which is equal to Z by Lemma 4.5.10. Hence p uniquely determines a and .
We show that  does not depend on the choice of p. Indeed, if p  O F , then p = a ·p for some a  A, and we have
p = a · p = a · a-1 · p = a · a-1(a)-1 · a · p = (aaa -1)-1 · p.

We obtain the 1-cocycle

aaa -1  a.

Thus  = [a] does not depend on the choice of p. We write (O) for .

Let p  O  F , and assume that (O) = 1. We have

p = a-1 · p and a = (a)-1 a for some a  A.

Set pR = a · p  O  F . Then pR = a · p = a · a-1 · p = a · a -1 · a · p = a · p = pR .

Thus pR is real.

Conversely, if O  F contains a real point pR , then clearly (O) = 1, which proves (ii).

7.2.3. Assume that O contains a real point pR = g · p. We wish to classify real orbits in O. We write q for pR. Write Cq = ZG0(q) and set
Cq = (Cq, q), where q(c) = c.

Similarly we write Cp = ZG0(p). Since q = g · p, we have an isomorphism g : Cp -- Cq , c  gcg-1.

We transfer the real structure q on Cq to Cp using g. We obtain a real structure p on Cp:

p : Cp --g Cq --q Cq ---g 1 Cp , c  gcg-1  gcg-1  g-1 gcg-1g.

Let n = g-1g (see also the proof of Proposition 7.2.1), then p(c) = ncn-1 for c  Cp. We obtain a real algebraic group

Cp = (Cp, p), where p(c) = ncn-1 for c  Cp ,

and an isomorphism

g : Cp -- Cq,

inducing a bijection on cohomology

c  gcg-1

H1Cp -- H1Cq .

By Proposition 3.6.5, the real orbits in O are classified by H1Cq , and hence by H1Cp . The map is as follows. To c  Z1Cp we associate gcg-1  Z1Cq. We find g1  G0 such

100

MIKHAIL BOROVOI, WILLEM DE GRAAF, AND HO^ NG VA^ N LE^

that g1-1 g1 = gcg-1 (see Section 5.2) and set r = g1 · q = g1 g · p. To [c] we associate the real orbit G0(R) · r  O.
In order to check our calculations, we show that r = g1 g · q is real. We calculate: r = g1 g · p = g1 · g · p = g1 gcg-1 · gn · n-1 · p = g1 gc · p = g1 g · p = r,
because c  Cp = ZG0(p). Thus r is real.
7.2.4. Algorithm of finding real orbits in G · F.
We compute H1A. For any cohomology class  = [a]  H1A, we find all p  F such that p = a-1 · p. Further, we try to lift our a  Z1A to a cocycle n  Z1NG0(F) (this turns out to be always possible in the cases that we dealt with). Then we find g  G0 such that g-1g = n. We set pR = g · p; then pR is real. Thus we have a real point q = pR = g · p in the complex orbit O = G0 · p.

In order to find all real orbits in O, we consider the stabilizer Cp of p in G0, and the n-twisted complex conjugation p of Cp given by c  ncn-1 and set Cp = (Cp, p) as in 7.2.3. We compute the Galois cohomology H1Cp. For a cocycle c  Z1Cp, we consider gcg-1  Cq and we find g1  G0 such that
g1-1 g1 = gcg-1.
We set

(7.2.5)

r = g1 · q = g1 g · p.

To a cohomology class [c]  H1Cp we associate the real orbit G0(R) · r  O, where r is as in (7.2.5), and in this way we obtain a bijection between H1Cp and the set of real orbits in O.

7.3. Centralizers of semisimple elements. As written in Section 7.1 there are seven canonical sets Fk = Cpk for 1  k  7. They are explicitly described in [VE1978]. The elements of the same canonical set have the same centralizer in G0 by Lemma 4.5.10. Here we describe those centralizers. Throughout we write Z0(p) instead of ZG0(p).
The seventh canonical set just consists of 0, so we do not say anything about it.
7.3.1. F6 consists of the elements p1 with  = 0. We can easily compute the Lie algebra z0(p1) of Z0(p1), from which it follows that Z0(p1) is isomorphic to SL(3, C)3. Its elements are of the form diag(A1, A2, A3), where each Ai is a 3×3-matrix with determinant 1. With the methods of Example 5.1.1(2) we determined the component group. It is generated by (the image of)
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 000000010
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1   1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
h1 =  0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 .  0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 000001000
We have h31 = 1 and conjugation by h1 permutes the blocks on the diagonal of the elements of Z0(p1) cyclically. So Z0(p1) = h1  SL(3, C)3.
7.3.2. F5 consists of (p3 - p4),  = 0. From the computation of the Lie algebra it follows that Z0(p3-p4) is equal to H ·T2 where H is the group consisting of diag(A1, A1, A1) where A1 is a 3 × 3-matrix with determinant 1. Furthermore T2 is a 2-dimensional central torus consisting of diag(a, a, a, b, b, b, (ab)-1, (ab)-1, (ab)-1) for a, b  C. So the intersection of T2 and H is µ3. The component group of Z0(p3 - p4) is computed in the same way as for family six, by adding the equations corresponding to the diagram automorphisms of

TRIVECTORS IN R9

101

the semisimple part. The component group is again generated by the image of h1. Hence Z0(p3 - p4) = h1  H · T2.
7.3.3. F4 consists of p1 + µ(p3 - p4) with µ(3 - µ3)(3 + 8µ3) = 0. Here the stabilizer can be computed as in the previous two cases, or by observing that from Lemma 4.5.10 it follows that the stabilizer in this case is Z0(p1)  Z0(p3 - p4). It follows that the identity component of the stabilizer is H (the same one as in Family five). The component group is generated by cosets of h1 and h2 = diag(, , , 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1), where   C is a primitive third root of unity. We have that h1, h2 commute with H, and they commute with each other modulo µ3  H. Hence the component group is isomorphic to C3 × C3.
7.3.4. F3 consists of 1p1 + 2p2 with 12(61 - 62) = 0. By Lemma 4.5.10 the stabilizer is equal to Z0(p1)  Z0(p2). The first of these already has been determined. It is possible to determine Z0(p2) in the same way (in fact, it is a conjugate of Z0(p1), the conjugating matrix can be determined directly from the expressions for p1, p2). Then we can determine the intersection; this poses no fundamental difficulty. Alternatively we can proceed as in Example 5.1.1(3).
From the Lie algebra of Z0(F3) we conclude that the identity component is a 4dimensional torus consisting of the elements

T4(t1, t2, t3, t4) = diag(t1, t2, (t1t2)-1, t3, t4, (t3t4)-1, (t1t3)-1, (t2t4)-1, t1t2t3t4),
for t1, t2, t3, t4  C. It turns out that the component group is generated by the cosets of h1 and h3 = diag(N, N, N ), where

0 0 1
N = 1 0 0. 010

Hence Z0(p) = h1, h3  T4. Here h1, h3 commute and are of order 3. They generate a group isomorphic to C3 × C3. An element of T4 naturally composes in three blocks of three. Conjugation by h1 permutes these blocks cyclically. Conjugation by h3 permutes the elements of each block cyclically.

7.3.5. F2 consists of 1p1 + 2p2 - 3p3, such that F (1, 2, 3) = 0, where F is a polynomial that we do not repeat here. Write B12 = Z0(p1)  Z0(p2) and similarly B123 = Z0(p1)  Z0(p2)  Z0(p3). We have determined B12 in the previous case, and now are interested in B123.
From the Lie algebra of B123 we see that B123 consists of
diag(a1, a2, (a1a2)-1, a2, (a1a2)-1, a1, (a1a2)-1, a1, a2)
for ai  C. For a subset S  SL(9, C) write C(S, p3) = {g  S | g · p3 = p3}, then

2

B123 = C(B12, p3) =

C(hi1hj3B12, p3).

i,j=0

It is straightforward to see that C(B12, p3) is normal in B123 and that the C(hi1hj3B12, p3) are its cosets. Moreover, if g1  C(h1B12, p3), g2  C(h3B12, p3) then C(hi1hj3B12, p3) = g1i g2j C(B12, p3).

102

MIKHAIL BOROVOI, WILLEM DE GRAAF, AND HO^ NG VA^ N LE^

By Gro¨bner basis computations we can determine the sets C(hi1hj3B12, p3). It turns out that C(B12, p3) = h2 B123. Furthermore, C(h1B12, p3) contains the element

and C(h3B12, p3) contains the element g2 = diag(A1, A2, A3) where A1 = 2N , A2 = N , A3 = N , and N is as in Family three. The elements h2, g1, g2 have order 3 and commute modulo µ3  B123. Hence the component group has order 27 and consists of the cosets of hi2g1j g2k for i, j, k = 0, 1, 2.
We have h2g1 = h1 · diag(, . . . , ) and h2g2 = h3. Hence

2

B123 =

hi1hj2hk3 B123.

i,j,k=0

The hi, 1  i  3 commute modulo µ3  B123. Hence the component group is isomorphic to C33.

7.3.6. F1 consists of 1p1 + · · · + 4p4 where the i  C satisfy Fi(1, . . . , 4) = 0, where the Fi, 1  i  5 are polynomials in four indeterminates that we do not repeat here. Set B1234 = Z0(p1)  · · ·  Z0(p4). Then B1234 is a finite group. It can be determined with the
same strategy as in the previous case. Alternatively, it is not difficult with Gro¨bner bases to determine the sets Z0(p3)Z0(p4)hi1hj3B12; each has 27 elements. (Note that the union of hi1hj3B12 is Z0(p1)  Z0(p2), see the computation of the centralizer for Family three.) We have used both approaches and in both cases obtained the same group. It is generated by h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 where h4 = diag(, 2, 1, , 2, 1, , 2, 1) and h5 = diag(, . . . , ). The group is of order 35; µ3 = h5 is a normal subgroup of order 3. The other generators commute modulo µ3 and have order 3. Hence the quotient group is isomorphic to C34. (In [VE1978] it is stated that B1234 is cyclic of order 81.)

7.4. The Weyl group and the groups p. In [VE1978] a construction is given of a set of generators of the Weyl group W . We have carried it out and found that W is generated

where  is a primitive 9-th root of unity such that 3 = . Using these we can find elements of NG0(C) mapping to any given element of W .
Now for each canonical set Fk 1  k  6 we give generators of the group p = N (Wp)/Wp. By searching through subgroups of N (Wp) (with the help of GAP4) in each case we found coset representatives of Wp in N (Wp) that form a subgroup of N (Wp). Hence we give the generators of p as elements of W . We also determined the Galois cohomology sets H1p using a brute force computer program. We also give the output of that.

MIKHAIL BOROVOI, WILLEM DE GRAAF, AND HO^ NG VA^ N LE^

Proof. The short exact sequence
1  ZG0 (C)  NG0(C)  W  1, gives rise to a cohomology exact sequence
H1ZG0 (C)  H1NG0 (C)  H1W. By brute force (computer) computations it is easily established that H1W = 1. As seen in 7.3.6 ZG0(C) is a group of order 35. It has a normal subgroup of order 3 and the quotient is abelian. Hence by Corollary 3.2.2 and Lemma 3.2.3 we see that H1ZG0(C) = 1. It follows that H1NG0(C) = 1, and the theorem follows from Theorem 4.4.9.

7.5. Classification of semisimple elements. We have seven canonical sets Fk, 1  k  7, in C such that each semisimple element of gC1 is conjugate to an element of precisely
one canonical set. In this subsection we obtain the G0(R)-orbits of the real points in each complex semisimple orbit using the method of 7.2.4.

7.5.1. Let p  F1 and set O = G0 · p.
We have that p = W and H1p = 1. So by Proposition 7.2.1 O has an R-point if and only if it has one in F1. Alternatively, this follows from Proposition 4.5.13(2) and Theorem 7.4.1. So assume that p = p. Then the G0(R)-orbits in O are classified by H1ZG0(p). We have that ZG0(p) is a finite group of order 35. It has a normal subgroup of order 3 and the quotient is abelian. Hence by Corollary 3.2.2 and Lemma 3.2.3 we see that H1ZG0(p) = 1. We conclude that O corresponds to one real orbit.

7.5.2. If p  F2 then H1p = {[1], [-1]}. So by Proposition 7.2.1 the G0-orbits of elements in F2 having real points fall into two classes: the orbits of p  F2 with p = p and the orbits of p  F2 with p = -p.
Let O = G0 · p with p = p. The G0(R)-orbits in O are classified by H1ZG0(p). The identity component of ZG0(p) is a 2-dimensional torus and the component group is abelian of order 27. Hence by Corollary 3.2.2 and Corollary 3.1.19 H1ZG0(p) = 1. Hence O corresponds to one real orbit.

Let O = G0 · p with p = -p. Then p = i1p1 + i2p2 - i3p3 with i  R. Set

Then n1 is a cocycle, it normalizes C and acts as -1 on C. (It is found by writing -1 = w22, and n1 = w^24.) Furthermore g1-1g1 = n1. (It is found by the methods of Section 5.2.) Now

This is the real representative of O.

Now we consider the group Cp = ZG0(p). Its identity component is a 2-dimensional torus T2 with elements T2(a1, a2). We have
nT2(a1, a2)n-1 = T2(a1, a-1 1a-2 1).

TRIVECTORS IN R9

105

So we set Cp = (Cp, ) where (T2(a1, a2)) = T2(a1, a-1 1a-2 1). The matrix of  on X(T2)

is

10 -1 -1

.

We have that ker(1+) = im (1-) =

e2

where e2 denotes the second basis

vector of Z2. Hence H1T2 = 1 and in the same way as for ZG0(p) we see that H1Cp = 1.

We conclude that also in this case O contains exactly one real orbit.

7.5.3. If p  F3 then H1p = {[1], [-1], [u1], [u2]}. So by Proposition 7.2.1 the G0-orbits of elements in F3 having real points fall into four classes: the orbits of p  F3 with p = p, the orbits of p  F3 with p = -p, the orbits of p  F3 with p = u1 · p, and the orbits of p  F3 with p = u2 · p.

Let O = G0 · p with p = p. The identity component of ZG0(p) is a 4-dimensional torus. The component group is abelian of order 9. In the same way as in 7.5.2 we conclude that H1ZG0(p) = 1. Hence O corresponds to one real orbit.

Let O = G0 · p with p = -p. Then p = i1p1 + i2p2 with i  R. We use the n1, g1 from 7.5.2. The real representative of O is

Let Cp = ZG0(p). Its identity component is a 4-dimensional torus T4 with elements T4(t1, t2, t3, t4). We have

nT4(t1, t2, t3, t4)n-1 = T2(t¯1, t¯-1 1t¯-2 1, t¯-1 1t¯-3 1, t¯1t¯2t¯3t¯4).

So we set Cp = (Cp, ) where  on T4 is given by the above formula. The matrix of 

 1 0 0 0

on

X(T4)

-1 -1

-1 0

0 -1

We have ker(1 + ) = im (1 - ) and both are spanned by

1 1 11

(0, 1, 1, -1), (0, 0, 2, -1). Hence H1Cp = 1. Hence O contains exactly one real orbit.

Now we consider u1  W . We have u1 · p1 = -p1, u2 · p2 = p2. So the set of p  F3 with p = u1 · p consists of p = i1p1 + 2p2 with 1, 2  R. Let O be the orbit with this representative.

We have u1 = w3w2w3(w2w3-1w2)2. Set n2 = w^3w^2w^3(w^2w^3-1w^2)2. We also compute g2  G0 with g2-1g2 = n2. We obtain

Now

n2T4(t1, t2, t3, t4)n-2 1 = T2(t¯1, t¯2, t¯-1 1t¯-3 1, t¯-2 1t¯-4 1).

We set Cp = (Cp, ) where  on T4 is given by the above formula. The matrix of 

1 0 0 0

Then ker(1 + ) = im (1 - ) and both are spanned by

(0, 0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 0, 1). Hence the H1Cp = 1 and O contains one real orbit.

Now we consider u2  W . We have u2 · p1 = p2, u2 · p2 = p1. So the set of p  F3 with p = u2 · p consists of p = 1p1 + 2p2 with 1 = x + iy, 2 = x - iy, x, y  R. Let O be the orbit with this representative.

Now

n3T4(t1, t2, t3, t4)n-3 1 = T2(t¯1, t¯-1 1t¯-3 1, t¯-1 1t¯-2 1, t¯1t¯2t¯3t¯4).

We set Cp = (Cp, ) where  on T4 is given by the above formula. The matrix of

We have

ker(1 + ) = im (1 - ) and both are spanned by

(0, 1, 1, -1). Hence H2Cp = 1 and also in this case O contains one real orbit.

7.5.4. If p  F4 then H1p = {[1]}. So by Proposition 7.2.1 the G0-orbits of elements in F3 having real points all have a representative in F4.
Let p  F4 be such that p = p and let O be its G0-orbit. The identity component of ZG0(p) is isomorphic to SL(3, C) and the component group is abelian of order 9. Hence H1ZG0(p) = 1 and we conclude that O contains exactly one real orbit.

7.5.5. If p  F5 then H1p = {[1], [-1]}. So by Proposition 7.2.1 the G0-orbits of elements in F5 having real points fall into two classes: the orbits of p  F5 with p = p and the orbits of p  F5 with p = -p.
Let O = G0 · p with p = p. The identity component of ZG0(p) is T2 · H where H consists of M (A) = diag(A, A, A) for A  SL(3, C) and T2 consists of the elements
T2(a, b) = diag(a, a, a, b, b, b, (ab)-1, (ab)-1, (ab)-1).

The surjective map T2 × H  T2H, (t, h)  th has a kernel of order 3. Hence by Lemma 3.2.3 we see that H1T2H = 1. The component group is abelian of order 9. Hence by Corollary 3.2.2 and Corollary 3.1.19 H1ZG0(p) = 1. So O contains one real orbit.
Now let p  F5 be such that p = -p. Hence p = i(p3 - p4) with   R. We use n1, g1 from 7.5.2. The real representative of O is

The matrix of  on X(T2) is

Hence ker(1 + ) = im (1 - ) and H1(T2, ) = 1.

For any natural number n and for any cocycle V  PGL(n, C), (that is, satisfying V V = 1), the involution (A) = V AV -1 is called inner. The group of real points of

the corresponding twisted form is isomorphic to either SL(n, R) or SL(n/2, H), where

TRIVECTORS IN R9

107

H denotes the division algebra of Hamilton's quaternions. In the first case we have
H1(SL(n, C), ) = {1}. In the second case, which can happen only for even n = 2m, we have #H1(SL(2m, C), ) = 2. Since here we have n = 3 it follows that H1Cp = 1.

7.5.6. If p  F6 then H1p = {[1], [-1]}. So by Proposition 7.2.1 the G0-orbits of elements in F6 having real points fall into two classes: the orbits of p  F6 with p = p and the orbits of p  F6 with p = -p.

Let O = G0 · p with p = p. The identity component of ZG0(p) is isomorphic to SL(3, C)3, consisting of M (A1, A2, A3) = diag(A1, A2, A3), where each Ai  SL(3, C). The component group is of order 3. Hence H1ZG0(p) = 1. Therefore O contains one real orbit.
Let p  F6 be such that p = -p. Hence p = ip1 with   R. We use n1, g1 from 7.5.2. The real representative of O is

Let Cp = ZG0(p) and Cp = (Cp, ), where (g) = n1gn-1 1. We have

(M (A1, A2, A3)) = M (V A1V, V A3V, V A2V ),

with V as in 7.5.5.

In the same way as in the previous case it follows that H1Cp = 1.

8. The orbits of mixed type

8.1. Methods. As in Section 7 we let G0 = SL(9, C) and G0(R) = SL(9, R).
As seen in Section 4.2 every x  gC1 can be written as x = p + e where p  gC1 is semisimple and e  gC1 is nilpotent and [p, e] = 0 (and the same statement holds for g1). It is said that x is of mixed type if both p, e are nonzero. Similarly, we say that an orbit consisting of such elements is of mixed type.

First we briefly comment on the classification of the G0-orbits of elements of mixed

type, see also Subsection 4.6. It is clear that every such orbit has a representative p + e

such that p lies in one of the sets Fk for 1  k  6 (see Section 7). Now fix a p  Fk

and write a = zgC(p). Then a inherits the grading from gC. The nilpotent e such that

p + e is of mixed type lie in a1. Furthermore, p + e1, p + e2 are G0-conjugate if and only

if e1, e2 are ZG0(p)-conjugate. The groups ZG0(p) have been determined in Section 7.3.

The Lie algebra of ZG0(p) [Graaf2017], Chapter 8) we

is a0 can

. Hence by using the method of [Vinberg1979] (see also determine the ZG0(p)-orbits of nilpotent elements in a1.

Finally we reduce the list by considering conjugacy under the elements of the component

group of ZG0(p). [VE1978] contains lists of representatives of nilpotent parts of elements of mixed type, for p  Fk, 1  k  6. Let TpC be the set of homogeneous sl2-triples in a. Note that by Theorem 4.3.5 the nilpotent ZG0(p)-orbits in a1 correspond bijectively to the ZG0(p)-orbits in TpC. Note also that ZG0(p), zgC(p) only depend on Fk, not on the particular element p. Hence the orbits of the nilpotent parts also only depend only on Fk.

Now we turn to the problem of classifying G0(R)-orbits of mixed type. Section 7 has
descriptions of the G0(R)-orbits of semisimple elements in g1. Let p be a representative of such an orbit and again let a = zgC(p). Analogously to the complex case we need to determine the ZG0(R)(p)-orbits of real nilpotent elements in a1. By Theorem 4.3.5 these correspond bijectively to the ZG0(R)(p)-orbits in the set Tp of homogeneous and real sl2triples in a. Let t = (h, e, f ) be a homogeneous and real sl2-triple in a containing e. Let
Z0(p, t) = {g  ZG0(p) | g · h = h, g · e = e, g · f = f }.

108

MIKHAIL BOROVOI, WILLEM DE GRAAF, AND HO^ NG VA^ N LE^

Then by Proposition 3.6.5 there is a bijection between the real ZG0(R)(p)-orbits contained in the ZG0(p)-orbit of t and ker[H1Z0(p, t)  H1ZG0(p)]. Note that in Section 7.5 it has been established hat H1ZG0(p) = 1 in all cases. Hence the orbits we are interested in here correspond bijectively to H1Z0(p, t).

Remark 8.1.1. More in general (when considering a different -group) it may happen that H1ZG0(p) = 1. Then H1Z0(p, t) corresponds bijectively to the G0(R)-orbits contained in the G0-orbit of the 4-tuple (p, h, e, f ). So for each [c]  H1Z0(p, t) we compute a g  G0 with g-1g = c and obtain the mixed element g · (p + e) with semisimple part g · p and nilpotent part g · e. This way we get all real orbits of mixed elements contained in the complex orbit of p + e.

We say that a real semisimple element is canonical if it lies in one of the canonical sets Fk. The procedure that we use to classify the mixed elements whose semisimple part is noncanonical is markedly more complex than the procedure for classifying those with canonical semisimple part.
If the semisimple element p is canonical then we consider a real nilpotent e  a = zgC(p) lying in the homogeneous real sl2-triple t = (h, e, f ). In order to compute representatives of the real G0(R)-orbits contained in the G0-orbit of p + e we compute the centralizer Z0(p, t) and its Galois cohomology H1Z0(p, t). The elements of the latter set correspond to the real orbits that we are looking for. It is possible to take the same approach when p is not canonical. However, in that case the groups Z0(p, t) tend to be difficult to describe (they can be nonsplit, for example) and therefore difficult to work with. In the next paragraphs we describe a different method for this case. The main idea is the following. We have that p is conjugate over C to a canonical semisimple element q. So if t1 is a real homogeneous sl2-triple in zgC(p) then t1 is conjugate to a homogeneous sl2-triple t in zgC(q). Also the stabilizers Z0(p, t1) and Z0(q, t) are conjugate. We define a conjugation on the latter so that these two groups are -equivariantly isomorphic. Finally we compute H1Z0(q, t) where we use the modified conjugation.
Let p  g1 be a real noncanonical semisimple element and of the form p = gq, where g  G0 and q  Fk where Fk is one of the canonical sets found in Section 7.1. From our construction (Proposition 7.2.1) it follows that setting n = g-1g entails n  Z1NG0(Fk) and n · q = q. In all cases we have that n is real, so that n2 = 1. In the sequel these g and n are fixed.
Also define  : zgC(q)  gC1  zgC(p)  gC1 by (x) = g · x. Because ZG0(p) = gZG0 (q)g-1 this is a bijection between the sets of nilpotent elements in the respective spaces mapping ZG0(q)-orbits to ZG0(p)-orbits. For x  zgC(q)  gC1 we have that g · x is real (that is, g · x = g · x) if and only if nx = x. Since n  NG0(Fk) we have that q and n · q both lie in Fk and therefore have the same centralizer in gC (Section 7.1), hence n · zgC(q) = zgC(q). From n · q = q it follows that zgC(q) is stable under complex conjugation x  x. We set u = zgC(q)  gC1 and define µ : u  u by µ(x) = nx. So for x  u we have that (x) is real if and only if µ(x) = x. Because n is a cocycle we have µ2(x) = x for all x  u.
Now fix a nilpotent e  zgC(q)  gC1 = u lying in a homogenous sl2-triple t = (h, e, f ). We let Y = ZG0(q) · e  u be its orbit. Then (Y ) is a ZG0(p)-orbit in zgC (p)  gC1 (and all nilpotent ZG0(p)-orbits in zgC(p)  gC1 are obtained in this way). We want to determine the real ZG0(R)(p)-orbits contained in (Y ).
Lemma 8.1.2. Let y0 be any element of Y . We have µ(Y ) = Y if and only if µ(y0)  Y .

Proof. Only one direction needs proof, so suppose that ny0 = g1y0 for some g1  ZG0(q). Note that  : ZG0(q)  ZG0(p), (h) = ghg-1, is an isomorphism. As p is real, i.e.,
p = p, we have that ZG0(p) is closed under conjugation. So for h  ZG0(q) we see that -1((h)) lies in ZG0(q). But the latter element is equal to nhn-1. We conclude that ZG0(q) is closed under h  nhn-1.
Let g2  ZG0 (q), then µ(g2y0) = ng2y0 = ng2n-1ny0 = ng2n-1g1y0 = g3y0 with g3  ZG0(q). We conclude that µ(Y ) = Y .
Now there are two possibilities. If µ(Y ) = Y then (Y ) has no real points by the previous lemma. In this case there are no real mixed elements of the form p + e1 conjugate to q + e. So we do not consider this e. Note that we can check whether (Y ) = Y using Lemma 8.1.2 and the methods for determining conjugacy of nilpotent elements outlined in Section 5.4.
On the other hand, if µ(Y ) = Y then we consider the restriction of µ to Y . We set Y = (Y, µ). With the methods of Section 3.8.1 we establish whether Y has a real point (that is a y  Y with µ(y) = y) and, if so, we find one. If, on the other hand, Y does not have a real point, then (Y ) has no real points either and also in this case we do not consider this e.
We briefly summarize the main steps of the method of Section 3.8.1 to find a real point in Y. We set H = ZG0(q) and define the conjugation  : H  H,  (h) = nhn-1. Set H = (H,  ) and we assume that H1H = 1. Then we do the following
(1) Compute h0  H such that µ(e) = h-0 1e. (2) Set C = ZH (e) and let  : C  C be the conjugation defined by (c) = h0 (c)h-0 1.
Set C = (C, ). (3) Set d = h0 (h0) and consider the class [d]  H2C. If [d] = 1 then Y has no real
point and we stop. (4) Otherwise we can find a c  C with c(c)d = 1. Set h1 = ch0. (Then µ(e) = h-1 1e
and h1 (h1) = 1.) (5) Because H1H = 1 we can find u  H such that uh1 (u)-1 = 1. Then y = u · e is
a real point of Y.
Now assume that Y has a real point e. Then we set e1 = g · e and find a real homogeneous sl2-triple t1 = (h1, e1, f1) in zgC (p). Set t = (h, e, f ) where h = g-1 · h1, f  = g-1 ·f1. Furthermore, we determine a g  ZG0(q) such that g ·t = t, then gg ·t = t1. We set g0 = gg and n0 = g0-1g0. Then n0  Z1NG0(Fk). We compute Zq = ZG0(q, t) (the stabilizer of t in ZG0(q)). We define  : Zq  Zq by (z) = n0zn-0 1 (in the same way as in the proof of Lemma 8.1.2 it is seen that Zq is closed under ). We set Zq = (Zq, ). Also, we set Zp = ZG0(p, t1) and Zp = (Zp, ). Then  : Zq  Zp, (z) = g0zg0-1 is a -equivariant isomorphism. Therefore the real orbits in (Y ) correspond bijectively to H1Zq.
In order to find representatives of the orbits we use the methods of Section 5.2. The most straightforward way to do this is to use the group ZG0(q), the conjugation  and the elements of H1Zq. For a class [c]  H1Zq we find an a  ZG0(q) with ac = (a) = n0an-0 1. Then g0a · e is a nilpotent element in zgC(p)  gC1 and p + g0a · e is a representative of the orbit of mixed elements corresponding to the class [c].
Remark 8.1.3. We have used an ad-hoc method by which it is possible to show in many cases that Y has a real point. The map µ : u  u is an R-linear involution.

Set uR = {x  u | x = x}; as n = n in all cases we have that µ(uR) = uR. Hence uR = u+  u-, where the latter are the eigenspaces of µ corresponding to the eigenvalues 1 and -1 respectively. We compute bases of these spaces and consider elements of three forms: u  u+, iu for u  u- and u1 + iu2 for u1  u+, u2  u-. All these elements are fixed by µ. We list many of these elements that are nilpotent and check to which ZG0(q)-orbit they belong (the latter by the methods described in Section 5.4). This way we have found real points in most cases.

8.2. The orbits. Here we list the data that we have computed in order to find the classification of the real orbits of mixed type. The semisimple part p of an element of mixed type is conjugate to an element of a canonical set Fk for 2  k  6. (The semisimple elements in F1 have trivial centralizer and F7 = {0}.) For each k between 2 and 6 we have a subsection containing the data for the semisimple elements in Fk.
If p is canonical (that is, p  Fk) then we give the representatives of the nilpotent ZG0(p)-orbits in zgC(p)  gC1 (they have been taken from [VE1978]). These representatives are denoted e. We also give a description of ZG0(p, t) where t is a homogeneous sl2-triple containing e. For simplicity we denote this group by Zp,e. Thirdly we give H1Zp,e.

If p is not canonical then p = g · q where q  Fk, g  G0. In these cases we go through

the nilpotent ZG0(q)-orbits in zgC(q)  gC1 in the same order in which this was done in the list for canonical p. So we do not repeat the representatives e. Instead we consider

Y = (Y, µ) where Y We start by giving

a=reZaGl 0p(oqi)n·teea nind

µ: Y.

Y  Y is If Y has

defined no real

by µ(y) = ny where n = g-1g. points then the corresponding

orbit is simply not considered. This only happens once for F3: for one of the p we only give data corresponding to two nilpotent orbits, instead of eight. We give the element g0 = gg which has the property that g0 ·e = g ·e is a real nilpotent element in zgC(p)gC1 (conjugate to e). Furthermore, we give the element n0 = g0-1g0. The centralizer Zq,e = ZG0(q, t) has already been described in the list relative to the canonical semisimple element, so we do not repeat it. However, we now use the conjugation  given by (z) = n0zn-0 1. We also describe this conjugation more in detail, allowing us to compute H1(Zq,e, ) of which we

also give the elements.

Throughout we use the elements h1, h2, h3, h4 from Section 7.3, and n1, n2, n3 from Section 7.5. Also we use the Galois cohomology sets H1p determined in Section 7.4. In particular, H1p = 1 if p is in F4, it is {[1], [-1]} if p is in F2, F5, F6 and it is {[1], [-1], [u1], [u2]} if p is in F3. This means that for F4 we only have a list of data corresponding to canonical p. For F2, F5, F6 we have two lists, one for canonical p and one for noncanonical p. For F3 we have four lists, one for canonical p and three for noncanonical p.

The Galois cohomology of tori T = (T, ) is computed using the algorithm of Section 5.3. In all cases the computation is straightforward and we do not go into the details.

8.2.1. Let p  F2, p = p. Then ZG0(p) has two nonzero nilpotent orbits in zgC(p)  gC1.
(1) e = e168 + e249. Let  be a primitive third root of unity and set g1 = h2, g2 = h1h23, g3 = diag(2, 1, , 1, , 2, , 2, 1) and g4 = diag(2, , 1, , 1, 2, 1, 2, ). Then Zp,e is of order 81 and generated by g1, . . . , g4. So by Proposition 3.3.16 we see that H1Zp,e = 1.
(2) e = e168. Let T1 denote the 1-dimensional torus consisting of the elements T1(t) = diag(1, t, t-1, t, t-1, 1, t-1, 1, t), t  C×. Let g1, g2, g3 be as in the previous case. Then Zp,e = g1i1 g2i2 g3i3 T1, 0  ij  2. So using Proposition 3.3.16 we see that H1Zp,e = 1.

Now let p be a real semisimple element conjugate to q  F2 with q = -q. Then the map µ is given by µ(y) = n1y.

(1) e249 - e357 is a real element in Y. In this case Zq,e is a finite group of order 81. So whatever the conjugation is, by Proposition 3.3.16 we have that H1Zq,e = 1.

For the conjugation  of Zq,e we have (T1(t)) = T1(t-1). So H1T1 = {[1], [T1(-1)]}. Hence by Proposition 3.3.16 H1Zq,e = {[1], [T1(-1)]}.

8.2.2. Let p  F3, p = p. Then ZG0(p) has eight nonzero nilpotent orbits in zgC (p)  gC1. In all cases the identity component of Zp,e is a torus and the component group has order 3k. So by Proposition 3.3.16 we have that H1Zp,e = 1 in all cases.

(1) e = e159 + e168 + e249 + e267. Here Zp,e consists of diag(22, 2, 22, 2, 2, , 22, , )

where 3 = 3 = 3 = 1. Hence it is abelian of order 27. (2) e = e159 + e168 + e249. Let T1 be the 1-dimensional torus consisting of
T1(s) = diag(1, s-1, s, s, 1, s-1, s-1, s, 1) for s  C×.
Let g = diag(, 2, 1, 1, , 2, 2, 1, ) where  is a primitive third root of unity. Then Zp,e = 2i,j=0hi2gj T1. (3) e = e159 + e168 + e267. Let T1 be the 1-dimensional torus consisting of
T1(s) = diag(1, s, s-1, s, s-1, 1, s-1, 1, s) for s  C×.
Then Zp,e = 2i,j=0hi2hj4T1. (4) e = e159 + e168. Let T2 be the 2-dimensional torus consisting of
T2(s, t) = diag(1, s-1t, st-1, st, t-1, s-1, s-1t-1, s, t) for s, t  C×.
Then Zp,e = 2i=0hi2T2. (5) e = e159 + e267. Let T2 be the 2-dimensional torus consisting of
T2(s, t) = diag(s, t, s-1t-1, t, s-1t-1, s, s-1t-1, s, t) for s, t  C×.
Then Zp,e = 2i,j=0hi2gj T2 where g = h1h3. (6) e = e168 + e249. Let T2 be the 2-dimensional torus consisting of
T2(s, t) = diag(t, s-1t-1, s, s, t, s-1t-1, s-1t-1, s, t) for s, t  C×.

(7) e = e159. Let T3 be the 3-dimensional torus consisting of T3(s, t, u) = diag(s-1u-1, s-1t-1, s2tu, stu2, s, s-2t-1u-2, t-1u-1, t, u) for s, t, u  C×.
Then Zp,e = 2i=0giT3 where g = h1h3. (8) e = e168. Let T3 be the 3-dimensional torus consisting of T3(s, t, u) = diag(s-1t-1, s2tu, s-1u-1, st2u, s-2t-2u-1, s, t-1u-1, t, u) for s, t, u  C×.
Then Zp,e = 2i=0giT3, where g = h1h23.

For the conjugation  of Zq,e we have (T2(s, t)) = T2(s-1, t-1). So H1T2 = {[1], [T2(-1, 1)], [T2(1, -1)], [T2(-1, -1)]}. Because #H1T2 = 4 we cannot use Proposition 3.3.16 in this case. The component group of Zq,e is generated by h2 = diag(, , , 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1) and (h2) = h22T2(, ). Let A = T2, B = Zq,e and C = B/A. Then we have the exact sequence 1  A  B  C  1, which by
Proposition 3.1.16 gives the exact sequence

H1A  H1B  H1C.

As C is of order 3 we have that H1C = 1. The conjugation acts nontrivially on C so that C is trivial. Hence by Proposition 3.1.21 we conclude that H1B =
{[1], [T2(-1, 1)], [T2(1, -1)], [T2(-1, -1)]}. (5) -e267 + e348 is a real element in Y. We have

Furthermore (T3(s, t, u)) = T3(s, t, s-2t-2u-1). Hence H1Zq,e = {[1], [T (1, 1, -1)]}.

8.2.3. Let p  F4, p = p. Then ZG0(p) has five nonzero nilpotent orbits in zgC(p)  gC1.
We have ZG0(p) = 2i,j=0hi1hj2Z. Moreover the elements of Z are block diagonal with equal 3 × 3-blocks. Write a = zgC(p) which inherits the grading from gC. Let e  a1 be a nilpotent element, and (h, e, f ) be a homogeneous sl2-triple in a. Let C denote the stabilizer of this triple in Z. Then also the elements of C are block diagonal with equal blocks. Below we describe C by just giving such a block. A computation shows that h1, h2 act as the identity on a1. This implies that the stabilizer Zp,e of the triple in ZG0(p) is 2i,j =0hi1 hj2 C .
In Case (3) we have #H1C = 2 and in the other cases H1C = 1. Hence by Proposition 3.3.16 we have that H1Zp,e consists of the classes of the same elements as H1C.

(1) e = e149 + e167 + e258 + e347. Here C = µ3. (2) e = e149 + e158 + e167 + e248 + e257 + e347. Here C is µ3. (3) e = e147 + e258. Here C is the union of two sets with respective blocks

where 3 = 3 = 1. So |C| = 18. Hence by Lemma 3.2.6 H1C = {[1], [Y (1, 1)]}. (4) e = e148 + e157 + e247. Here the 3 × 3-block is diag(t, t-2, t), where t  C.
(5) e = e147. The 3 × 3-block is

 0 0  0 a22 a23
0 a32 a33

with 3 = 1 and the determinant of the 2 × 2-block is 1 as well.

8.2.4. Let p  F5, p = p. Then ZG0(p) has seventeen nonzero nilpotent orbits in zgC(p)  gC1 .
Here ZG0(p) is equal to H · T2, where H is block diagonal with three equal 3 × 3-blocks of determinant 1, and T2 is a 2-dimensional central torus. Let e  zgC(p)  gC1 be nilpotent, contained in the homogeneous sl2-triple (h, e, f ). Let C denote the stabilizer of (h, e, f ) in ZG0(p). It turns out that in all cases C = H · T2 where H is a subgroup of H and T2 is a subgroup of T2. We describe H by just giving one block denoted B. The elements of T2 are of the form
T2(s, t) = diag(s, s, s, t, t, t, (st)-1, (st)-1, (st)-1)

so we describe T2 by giving the general form of its elements, as T2(a, b). We have ZG0(p) = 2i=0hi1ZG0(p). It turns out that in all cases we have two possibili-
ties: either Zp,e = C or Zp,e = 2i=0hi1C. In the next list we only describe H1Zp,e when it is nontrivial.

(2) e = e123 + e149 + e158 + e167 + e248 + e257 + e347 + e456. Here Zp,e is exactly the same as in the previous case.

where 3 = 3 = 1. Furthermore, T2 = T2(, ) with 3 = 3 = 1. We have
Zp,e = C. The group C has order 54 (|H| = 18, |T2| = 9 and H  T2 = µ3). Hence by Lemma 3.2.6 H1Zp,e = {[1], [a]}, where a  H has 3 × 3-block Y (1, 1). (5) e = e123 + e149 + e158 + e167 + e248 + e257 + e347. Here B = diag(, , ), 3 = 1 and T2 = T2(, 2t), where 3 = 1, t  C×. Hence H  T2 so that C = T2. We have Zp,e = C. (6) e = e149 + e167 + e258 + e347. Here B = diag(, , ), 3 = 1 and T2 = T2(s, t), where s, t  C×. Also here we see that C = T2. We have Zp,e = 2i=0hi1C. (7) e = e123 + e148 + e157 + e247 + e456. Here we have B = diag(u, u-2, u), u  C×, and T2 = T2(, ) with 3 = 3 = 1. Furthermore Zp,e = C.

consisting of T2(1, t), where t  C×. By Lemma 3.2.6 H1H = {[1], [a]}, where

a  H is of order 2 and fixed under the conjugation . A small computation shows

that the matrix a with three 3 × 3-blocks Y (1, 1) satisfies these requirements.

Secondly, (T2(1, t)) = T2(1, t-1). Hence H1S = {[1], [T2(1, -1)]}. It follows that

H1Zq,e = {[1], [a], [T2(1, -1)], [aT2(1, -1)]}.

Here Zq,e = H × S, where H is isomorphic to SL(2, C) and consists of elements M (A), where A is a 2×2-matrix of determinant 1; furthermore S is a 1-dimensional

torus consisting of elements T2(1, t), t  C×. Let U =

Then (M (A)) =

U AU -1. A straightforward calculation shows that M (A) is invariant under  if and

only if A =

ab ¯b a¯

with aa¯-b¯b = 1. It follows that the group of -fixed points of H is

a noncompact form of SL(2, R), and hence isomorphic to SL(2, R). It follows that

H is -equivariantly isomorphic to SL(2, C) and hence H1H = 1. Furthermore,

(T2(1, t)) = T2(1, t-1). Therefore H1S = {[1], [T2(1, -1)]}. The component group is of order 9. So by Proposition 3.3.16 we see that H1Zq,e = {[1], [T2(1, -1)]}.

Then (M (B)) = M (U BU -1).

Since U

we see that the group of -fixed points of Zq,e is an inner real form of SL(3, C).

Now any inner real form of SL(3, C) is isomorphic to SL(3, R). Hence Zq,e is -

equivariantly isomorphic to SL(3, C), so that H1Zq,e = 1. The component group

is of order 3. So by Proposition 3.3.16 we see that H1Zq,e = 1.

Here Zq,e = H ×S where H consists of matrices M (B), where B is a 3×3-matrix of determinant 1, and S is a 1-dimensional torus consisting of elements T2(1, t). We have that (M (B)) is exactly the same as in the previous case, so that H1H = 1. Furthermore, (T2(1, t)) = T2(1, t-1). We conclude that H1S = {[1], [T2(1, -1)]} so that also H1Zq,e = {[1], [T2(1, -1)]}.
For the cases 2, 5, 9, of the previous list the ad-hoc procedure indicated in Remark 8.1.3 did not succeed in finding a real point in Y. So we resort to the methods of Section 3.8.1. These are summarized in Section 8.1, here we give the details of the computation. The centralizer H = ZG0(q) is described in 7.3.2. We have H = h1  M · T2, where M consists of M (A) = diag(A, A, A), det(A) = 1 and T2 consists of the elements T2(a, b) = diag(a, a, a, b, b, b, (ab)-1, (ab)-1, (ab)-1) for a, b  C. For the conjugation  we have  (h) = n1hn-1 1. Set H = (H,  ).
Lemma 8.2.5. H1H = 1.

Proof. We have M  T2 = µ3. Therefore, H1(M · T2,  )  H1(M,  ) × H1(T2,  ).

We have n1M (A)n-1 1 = M (U AU -1) where

U

=

-1 0

0 0

0 -1

0 -1 0

and n1T2(a, b)n-1 1 = T (a¯, a¯-1¯b-1). Hence (M,  ) is an inner form of SL(3, R). So it is isomorphic to SL(3, R) and therefore H1(M,  ) = 1. By the method of Section 5.3 it is straightforward to see that H1(T2,  ) = 1 as well. Hence H1(M ·T2,  ) = 1. By Proposition 3.3.16 we conclude that H1H = 1.

The first step now is to find h0  H such that e = h0µ(e). Let U be as in the proof of the previous lemma. For orbit 2 we have h0 = h1diag(-U, U, -U ) (where h1 is as in 7.3.1). For orbit 5 we have h0 = diag(-U, -U, U ). For orbit 9 we have h0 = diag(U, U, U ).
Then we set d = h0 (h0). For orbits 2 and 9 we have d = 1, whereas for orbit 5 we have d = diag(1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1) = T2(1, -1). So only for the latter orbit we need to change h0. Since d lies in T2 we try and just work with that group. With  : T2  T2, (c) = h0 (c)h-0 1 we have (T2(a, b)) = T2(a, a-1b-1). So T2(a, b)(T2(a, b))d = T2(aa, -ba-1b-1), and we want a, b such that aa = 1 and a-1bb-1 = -1. We see that we can take a = 1, b = i. Therefore for orbit 5 we replace h0 by T2(1, i)h0. We get h0 = diag(-U, -iU, -iU ).
Finally we compute u  H such that uh0 (u)-1 = 1. For this we use the methods of Section 5.2. For orbits 2, 5, 9 we get respectively that u is

Here ZG0(p) consists of the elements diag(A1, A2, A3) where each Ai is a 3 × 3-matrix of determinant 1. The component group is generated by the coset of h1.
In the next list, where we omit the computation of H1Zp,e, it follows directly from the results in Section 3, especially Proposition 3.3.16 that it is trivial.

(1) e = e159 + e168 + e249 + e258 + e267 + e347. Here Zp,e consists of diag(22, 22, 22, , , , , , ),
where 3 = 3 = 1. (2) e = e159 + e168 + e249 + e257 + e258 + e347. Here Zp,e is the same as in the previous
case. (3) e = e149 + e158 + e167 + e248 + e259 + e347. Here Zp,e consists of
X(, , ) = diag(2, 2, 2, , , , , , ),
where 3 = 3 = 1 and 2 = 1. By Lemma 3.2.6 it follows that H1Zp,e = {[1], [X(1, 1, -1)]}.
(4) e = e149 + e158 + e248 + e257 + e367. Here Zp,e consists of diag(2t-1, 2t-1, 2t2, t, t, t-2, , , )
where 3 = 1 and t  C×. (5) e = e149 + e167 + e168 + e257 + e348. Here Zp,e consists of
diag(2t-1, 2t2, 2t-1, t, t-2, t, , , )
where 3 = 1 and t  C×. (6) e = e149 + e158 + e248 + e267 + e357. Here Zp,e consists of
diag(2t, 2t-2, 2t, t, t-2, t, t, t, t-2)
where 3 = 1 and t  C×. (7) e = e149 + e158 + e167 + e248 + e357. Here Zp,e consists of
diag(2, 2t3, 2t-3, t-1, t2, t-1, t, t-2, t)
where 3 = 1 and t  C×. (8) e = e149 + e167 + e258 + e347. Here Zp,e consists of
diag(s-1t-1, s2t2, s-1t-1, s, s-2, s, t, t-2, t),
where s, t  C× and Zp,e = 2i=0hi1Zp,e. (9) e = e147 + e158 + e258 + e269. Then Zp,e consists of
T (s, t) = diag(1, 1, 1, st, s-1, t-1, (st)-1, s, t)
where s, t  C×. The component group of Zp,e is of order 18 and generated by the classes of Q1 = diag(2, 2, 2, , , , 1, 1, 1) where  is a primitive third root of unity, and

Here [Q1] commutes with [Q2], [Q3] and the latter two generate a group isomorphic
to S3. We have that [Q2] is of order 2 and [Q3] is of order 3. Furthermore, Q2T (s, t)Q2 = T (t, s) and Q3T (s, t)Q-3 1 = T ((st)-1, s).
We use Proposition 3.3.17 to show that H1Zp,e = {[1], [Q2]}. Conditions (1)
and (2) of that proposition are obviously satisfied. For condition (3) we note that Q22 = 1, so that [Q2] in the component group lifts to a cocycle Q2  Z1Zp,e. For the

TRIVECTORS IN R9

123

corresponding twisted conjugation  of Zp,e we have (T (s, t)) = Q2T (s, t)Q2 = T (t, s). Hence we have H1Q2Zp,e = 1. So the desired conclusion indeed follows by Proposition 3.3.17. (10) e = e149 + e158 + e167 + e248 + e257 + e347. Here Zp,e is of order 81 and generated by diag(2, 2, 2, , , , 1, 1, 1), diag(, 1, 2, 2, , 1, 2, , 1), diag(, 2, 1, , 2, 1, 2, 1, ) and h1. From Lemma 3.2.3 it follows that H1Zp,e = 1. (11) e = e149 + e167 + e248 + e357. Here Zp,e consists of
diag(s, st3, s-2t-3, s-1t-1, s2t2, s-1t-1, t, t-2, t),
where s, t  C×. (12) e = e149 + e167 + e247 + e258. Here Zp,e consists of
diag(s, s-2, s, t, s3t-2, s-3t, s2t-1, s-1t2, s-1t-1),
where s, t  C×. (13) e = e149 + e158 + e167 + e248 + e257. Here Zp,e consists of
diag(2, 2s, 22s-1, 2s-1, , s, 2s-1, , s),
where 3 = 3 = 1 and s  C×. (14) e = e149 + e157 + e168 + e247 + e348. Here Zp,e = H × Zp,e. The identity component
Zp,e consists of diag(1, A, 1, A, A-T , 1) where A is a 2 × 2-matrix of determinant 1. The group H is of order 9 and consists of the elements
diag(22, 22, 22, , , , , , )
where 3 = 3 = 1. Hence H1Zp,e = H1H × H1Zp,e. Now H1H = 1 by Corollary 3.2.2 and Zp,e is isomorphic to SL(2, C) and hence has trivial cohomology as well. We conclude that H1Zp,e = 1. (15) e = e158 + e169 + e247. Here Zp,e = D × T1. The elements of D are of the form diag(1, 1, 1, d-1, A, d, A-T ) where A is a 2 × 2-matrix and d = det(A)  C×. Furthermore T1 consists of diag(s, s-2, s, 1, 1, 1, s2, s-1, s-1) where s  C×. We see that H1D = H1T1 = 1 and therefore H1Zp,e = 1. (16) e = e149 + e158 + e167 + e247. Here Zp,e consists of
diag(2, 2st2, 2s-1t-2, t-1, s-1, st, s-1t-1, s, t),
where s  C× and 3 = 1. (17) e = e148 + e157 + e249 + e267. Here Zp,e consists of elements of the form
diag(A, d-1, d-1, dA-T , d-1, dA-T ),
where A is a 2×2-matrix and d = det(A) = 0. Let g = diag(2, 2, 2, , , , 1, 1, 1) where  is a primitive third root of unity. Then Zp,e = 2i=0giZp,e. (18) e = e147+e158+e248+e259. Here Zp,e consists of elements of the form diag(A1, A2, B) where A1, A2, B are 3 × 3-matrices. We have A1 = diag(A, d-1) with A a 2 × 2matrix and d = det(A). Secondly, A2 = diag(d-1A, d). Thirdly, there is a surjective homomorphism  : GL(2, C)  PSL(2, C) with B = (A). Let g = diag(2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, , , ), where  is a primitive third root of unity. Then Zp,e = 2i=0giZp,e. (19) e = e149 + e157 + e248. Here Zp,e consists of

(20) e = e147 + e258. We have Zp,e = H  Zp,e, where Zp,e consists of T4(s, t, u, v) = diag(s-1u-1, t-1v-1, stuv, s, t, s-1t-1, u, v, u-1v-1)
with s, t, u, v  C×. Let g = diag(A, A, A) where A is the 3 × 3-matrix

Then H is generated by g and h1. This group is abelian of order 6. We have H1Zp,e = 1. Consider the conjugation  of Zp,e given by  (a) = gag-1. Then

 (T4(s, t, u, v)) = T4(t, s, v, u). So H1(Zp,e,  ) = 1. By Proposition 3.3.17 it now follows that H1Zp,e = {[1], [g]}. (21) e = e148 + e157 + e247. Here Zp,e consists of
diag(s-1tu, s-1t3u2, s2t-4u-3, st-2u-1, s, s-2t2u, t-1u-1, t, u)

where s, t, u  C×. Furthermore Zp,e = 2i=0hi1Zp,e. (22) e = e147 + e158 + e169. Here Zp,e = H × Zp,e where Zp,e consists of elements of the
form diag(1, A, B-T , B), where A is a 2 × 2-matrix of determinant 1 and B is a 3 × 3-matrix of determinant 1. (So that Zp,e = SL(2, C) × SL(3, C).) The group H consists of diag(, , , 22, 22, 22, , , ) with 3 = 3 = 1. (23) e = e147 + e158. Here Zp,e consists of the elements
diag(s-1, A, B, t-1, sB-T , s-2t)

where A, B are 2 × 2-matrices and s = det(A), t = det(B). We see that Zp,e is isomorphic to GL(2, C) × GL(2, C). Hence H1Zp,e = 1. (24) e = e147. Here Zp,e consists of
diag(st, A, s-1, B, t-1, C)

where A, B, C are 2 × 2-matrices and s = det(B), t = det(C) and such that det(A) = s-1t-1. We have Zp,e = 2i=0hi1Zp,e.

Let p be a real semisimple element conjugate to q  F6 with q = -q. Then the map µ is given by µ(y) = n1y.

(1) -ie149 - ie157 + ie168 - e247 - e258 + e269 + e347 - e358 + e369 is a real element in Y. In this case Zq,e is of order 9. Hence H1Zq,e = 1.
(2) -e149 + e157 + e259 - e267 + e348 - e359 is a real element in Y. In this case Zq,e is of order 9. Hence H1Zq,e = 1.
(3) -e149 + e157 + e158 - e169 - e267 + e348 is a real element in Y. We have

In this case Zq,e  C2 × C3 × C3. So the cohomology is determined by that of C2. The order 2 element is u = diag(1, -1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1). We have (h) = n0hn-0 1 = h-1 for h  Zq,e. So (u) = u and hence H1Zq,e = {[1], [u]}.

We write C = Zq,e. We consider the conjugation  of C defined by (c) = n0cn-0 1. The group C is a 2-dimensional torus consisting of the elements T2(s, t). We have (T2(s, t)) = T2(s-1, st). The component group is generated by the classes of Q1, Q2, Q3. We have (Q1) = Q1T2(, ), (Q2) = Q-3 1Q2Q3, (Q3) = Q-3 1.
Write K = C/C and C = (C, ), C = (C, ) and K = (K, ). As K is of order 2 · 9 it follows by Lemma 3.2.6 that H1K = {[1], [h]} where h is a -fixed

element of order 2. A computation shows that we can take

Then (h) = h and h2 = 1. We have a short exact sequence

1  C --i C --j K  1,

which gives rise to a cohomology exact sequence

K(R)  H1C --i H1C --j H1K.

Since H1C = 1 we see from the cohomology exact sequence that j-1[1] = {[1]}. In order to compute j-1[h] we use Corollary 3.1.23. For this we twist the exact
sequence by h; note that h is a cocycle in C. So we define a new conjugation 
of C by  (c) = h(c)h-1. We write K = (K,  ) and similarly we define C, C.
Following Construction 3.1.20 we define a right action of K(R) on H1C by

[t]  [a] = [a-1 · t ·  (a)] for t  Z1C, aC  K(R).

Now we compute the various objects that play a role here. We have  (T2(s, t)) = T2(s-1, t-1), implying that
H1C = {[1], [T2(1, -1)], [T2(-1, 1)], [T2(-1, -1)]}.
Furthermore, for the action of  on K we have  ([Q1]) = [Q21],  ([Q2]) = [Q2] and  ([Q3]) = [Q3]. Hence K(R) is the group of order 6 generated by [Q2], [Q3]. In the action defined above we have that [Q2] interchanges [T2(1, 1)], [T2(-1, -1)] and it fixes the other two. Furthermore [Q3] permutes [T2(1, 1)]  [T2(-1, 1)]  [T2(-1, -1)]  [T2(1, 1)] and fixes [T2(1, -1)]. Hence there are two orbits with respective representatives [1] and [T2(1, -1)].
Now by Corollary 3.1.23 it now follows that j-1[h] = {[h], [T2(1, -1)h]}. Hence H1Zq,e = {[1], [h], [T2(1, -1)h]}. (10) -ie159 - ie247 + ie257 + ie258 + ie269 - ie347 + ie349 + ie358 + ie369 is a real element in Y. Here Zq,e is of order 81. Hence H1Zq,e = 1, we do not need to work out the conjugation.

Here Zq,e is a 1-dimensional torus consisting of elements T1(s). We have n0T1(s)n-0 1 = T1(s). Hence H1Zq,e = 1. The component group is of order 9. Hence by Proposition 3.3.16 also H1Zq,e = 1. (14) -ie159 + ie249 + ie258 + ie357 + ie369 is a real element in Y. We have

We have Zq,e = H × Zq,e. Here H is a group of order 9 and Zq,e consists of the

elements M (A), where A is a 2 × 2-matrix of determinant 1. For the conjugation

we have n0M (A)n-0 1 = M (U AU -1) with U =

01 10

.

An easy calculation shows

that the group of real points of Zq,e consists of

M

ab ¯b a¯

where a, b  C and aa¯ - b¯b = 1.

So this group is a noncompact real form of SL(2, C) and hence isomorphic to SL(2, R). It follows that H1Zq,e = 1. As H is of order 9 also H1H = 1 (whatever the conjugation is). We conclude that H1Zq,e = 1.

Here Zq,e consists of the elements

M (s, A) = diag(s, s-2, s, det(A)-1, A, s2 det(A), s-1A-T )

where s  C×, A  GL(2, C). For the conjugation  we have

(M (s, A)) = n0M (s, A)n-0 1 = M (s, s-1 det(A)-1A).
Set T2 = C× × C×. Define j : Zq,e  T2 by j(M (s, A)) = (s, det(A)). Let N be the subgroup consisting of M (1, A) for A  SL(2, C). Then we have the exact sequence
1  N  Zq,e --j T2  1.
On T2 we use the conjugation  given by (s, t) = (s, s-2t-1). Then the map j is -equivariant. We have that H1(T2, ) = {[(1, 1)], [(1, -1)]}. By Proposition 3.1.16 we have the exact sequence

H1(N, )  H1(Zq,e, ) --j H1(T2, ).

We have (M (1, A)) = M (1, A) for A  SL(2, C). Hence H1(N, ) = 1, so that

j-1([(1, 1)]) = {[M (1, 1)]}.

Consider b = M (1,

0 -i

i 0

).

Then b(b) = 1 so that b  Z1(Zq,e, ).

Furthermore

j(b) = (1, -1). We twist the above sequence by b. By  we denote the twisted con-

jugation on Zq,e. A short computation shows that  (M (s, A)) = M (s, s-1(A)-T ). Hence N  is isomorphic to SU(2) so that H1(N,  ) = {[M (1, 1)], [M (1, -1)]}. Let

b = M (-1,

1 0

0 -1

),

so j(b) = (-1, -1)  T2 .

We

have

(b)-1M (1, 1) (b) = M (-1,

10 0 -1

)M (-1, -

10 0 -1

) = M (1, -1).

So for the action defined in Construction 3.1.20 we see that there is one orbit. Hence by Corollary 3.1.23 we see that j-1([(1, -1)]) = {[b]}. The conclusion is that H1(Zq,e, ) = {[M (1, 1)], [b]}.

Here Zq,e consists of the elements M (A) where A is a 2 × 2-matrix of nonzero determinant. For the conjugation  we have (M (A)) = M (det(A)-1U AU -1),

where

U=

1 -1 0 -1

so that U -1 = U.

We let N be the subgroup consisting of M (A) with det(A) = 1. We have an exact sequence
1  N  Zq,e --j C×  1
where j(M (A)) = det(A). On C× we use the conjugation  given by (s) = s-1; then j is -equivariant. This also means that H1C× = {[1], [-1]}. By Proposition 3.1.16 we have the exact sequence

H1N  H1Zq,e --j H1C×.
By direct computation it is straightforward to see that N  = {h  N | (h) = h} is isomorphic to SL(2, R). Hence H1N = 1. From the exactness of the sequence it now follows that j-1([1]) = {[1]}.
Now we want to determine j([-1]) using Corollary 3.1.23. For this we first lift -1  C× to a cocycle M (V ) in Zq,e. This V has to satisfy V (V ) = 1 and det(V ) = -1. But (V ) = det(V )-1U V U -1 = -U V U -1. So we need V with det(V ) = -1 and U V = -V -1U . A calculation shows that we can take

V=

11 10

.

Set W = V U =

1 -2 1 -1

.

Then the twisted conjugation is given by  (M (A)) =

M (det(A)-1W AW -1). A small computation shows that N  is isomorphic to

SU(2), so that H1(N,  ) = {[1], [-1]} (the latter follows from [Serre1997, III.4.5,

Theorem 6 and Example (a)]). Corollary 3.1.23 shows that

j-1([-1]) = {[M (V )], [M (-V )]}.

We show that [M (V )] = [M (-V )]. By Proposition 3.1.16 we have the exact
sequence (C×) -- H1(N,  ) --i H1(Zq,e,  ).
The twisted conjugation on C× is equal to . The fixed point group is (C×) = {s  C | ss = 1} is connected. This implies that ((C×) ) is trivial. So the kernel of i is trivial, and hence [M (1)], [M (-1)] are distinct in H1(Zq,e,  ). By 3.1.12 we see that the map H1(Zq,e,  )  H1(Zq,e, ), [x]  [xM (V )] is bijective. It follows that [M (V )], [M (-V )] are distinct elements in H1(Zq,e, ). So we conclude that H1(Zq,e, ) = {[1], [M (V )], [M (-V )]}. We have

We also describe a second approach. Write C = Zq,e. We know that C  GL(2, C) over C. Let D be the commutator subgroup of C and let D be its group of real points. Then D is isomorphic to SL(2, R) and hence to SU(1, 1). The quotient

(C)/D is a compact 1-dimensional torus. It follows that (C)  U(1, 1). Here

we regard U(1, 1) as the unitary group of the Hermitian form (with matrix) Q =

diag(1, -1). In other words we define the conjugation  : GL(2, C)  GL(2, C) by

(g) = Q(g)-T Q-1. Then U(1, 1) = GL(2, C).

Lemma 8.2.7 (well known). #H1(GL(2, C), ) = 3 with cocycles c1 = diag(1, -1), c0 = diag(1, 1) = 1, c2 = diag(-1, 1).
Idea of proof. We have that H1(GL(2, C), ) classifies equivalence classes of nondegenerate Hermitian forms on C2. By the Hermitian version of the inertia law, there are three classes of such forms with representatives F+,+ = diag(1, 1), F+,- = diag(1, -1), F-,- = diag(-1, -1). Thus #H1(GL(2, C), ) = 3. A calculation shows that c1F+,- = F+,+, c2F+,- = F-,-, and of course c0F+,- = F+,-, which completes the proof of the lemma.

Now we determine a -equivariant isomorphism  : GL(2, C)  C. For this we first determine an isomorphism between the Lie algebras of U(1, 1) = GL(2, C) and (C). We have that g  GL(2, C) lies in U(1, 1) if and only if gQgT = Q. So a u  gl(2, C) lies in Lie(U(1, 1)) if and only if uQ + QuT = 0. A short calculation
shows that Lie(U(1, 1)) is spanned by

The Lie algebra of C consists of elements L(u) for u  gl(2, C) where

L(u) = diag(u, -Tr(u), u + Tr(u) · 1, Tr(u), v)

where v is a 3 × 3-matrix depending linearly on u (it is the matrix of the adjoint representation of gl(2, C) on sl(2, C)). We have that L(u) lies in Lie((C)) if and only if U uU = u + Tr(u) · 1. A computation shows that the Lie algebra of (C)
is spanned by L(diag(i, i)), L(h), L(e), L(f ), where

h=

Lie(U(1, 1)).

with which we have (c1) = M (q1) and (c2) = M (q2). It follows that H1(C, ) = {[1], [M (q1)], [M (q2)]}.
Now we want to compute H1(C, ). Write K = C/C. We have a short exact

sequence

1  C --i C --j K  1

which by Proposition 3.1.16 gives rise to the exact sequence

H1(C, ) --i H1(C, ) --j H1(K, ).

Since K is of order 3 we have H1(K, ) = 1 (Corollary 3.2.2). Hence i is surjective. Write g = diag(2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, , , ), where  is a primitive third root of unity. Then the class of g generates K. We have

n0gn-0 1 = g2M (diag(2, 2)).
It follows that K = 1, so by Proposition 3.1.21 we see that i is injective. Hence H1(C, ) = {[1], [M (q1)], [M (q2)]}. (19) -ie159 + ie249 + ie259 + ie357 + ie359 is a real element in Y. We have

Here Zq,e = HZq,e. The identity component Zq,e consists of elements T4(s, t, u, v). We consider the conjugation  given by (a) = n0an-0 1 for a  Zq,e. We have

(T4(s, t, u, v))n-0 1 = T4(v, u, t, s).

Hence H1(Zq,e, ) = 1. The group H is abelian and of order 6. It is generated by g (of order 2) and h1 (of order 3). Set

d = T4(1, 1, -1, -1) = diag(-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1).

Then with g = gd we have gn0gn-0 1 = 1 so that g lifts to the cocycle g  Zq,e. Now consider the conjugation  of Zq,e given by  (a) = g(a)(g)-1. Then  (T4(s, t, u, v)) = T4(u, v, s, t). Hence H1(Zq,e,  ) = 1. By Proposition 3.3.17 it follows that H1(Zq,e, ) = {[1], [g]}. (21) -e149 + e157 + e259 - e359 is a real element in Y. We have

Here Zq,e is a 3-dimensional torus consisting of the elements T3(s, t, u). We have

Hence H1Zq,e = 1. The component group is of order 3 hence by Proposition 3.3.16 also H1Zq,e = 1. (22) -ie149 - ie157 + ie168 is a real element in Y. We have

Here Zq,e consists of the elements M (A, B) where A, B are respectively 2 × 2 and 3 × 3-matrices of determinant 1. For the conjugation  we have

(M (A, B)) = M (A, U B-T U -1).

Here if A =

then A =

We write C = C2 × C3, where C1 = {M (A, 1)} and C3 = {M (1, B)}. We compute H1(C2, ). We have

C2 =

M (A, 1) | A =

ab ¯b a¯

with aa¯ - b¯b = 1

,

which is noncompact, hence isomorphic to SL(2, R). It follows that H1(C2, ) = 1. We have that M (1, B)  C3 if and only if B-1U B-T = U . Passing to the
inverse we see that this is equivalent to BU BT = U . Now U is a symmetric matrix with one negative and two positive eigenvalues. Hence C3 is isomorphic to SU(2, 1). Set

Then AU AT = diag(1, 1, -1). Hence g  A-1gA is an isomorphism SU(2, 1)  C3. By Proposition 3.7.1 we have that H1SU(2, 1) consists of the classes of 1 and D = diag(-1, -1, 1). So H1(C3, ) consists of the classes of 1 and M (1, B) where

Alternatively we can consider the matrix B = -U . A direct computation shows that it lies in Z1(C3, ). Consider the Hermitian form HU given by
(x, y)  xt · U · y, x, y  C3.

We can diagonalize the matrix U using computer, that is, find a basis e1, e2, e3 in C3 in which our matrix U will be diag(1, 2, 3), where

1 = -0.8019 · · · < 0, 2 = 0.5549 · · · > 0, 3 = 2.2469 · · · > 0.

Now our B = -U multiplies e1 by the positive number -1, and it multiplies e2 and e3 by the negative numbers -2 and -3, respectively. It follows the Btwisted Hermitian form B(HU ) is negative definite, and hence nonisomorphic to HU . Thus B = -U is a nontrivial cocycle. So H1(C3, ) = {[1], [M (1, B)]}.
Using Proposition 3.3.16 we now see that H1Zq,e = {[1], [M (1, B)]} so that also H1Zq,e = H1{[1], [M (1, B)]}. (23) -e149 + e157 is a real element in Y. We have

Here Zq,e consists of M (A, B) where A, B  GL(2, C). For the conjugation  we
have (M (A, B)) = M (U AU -1, det(A)V (B)-T V -1)

where

U=

01 10

,V

=

01 -1 0

.

Set T2 = (C×)2 and define j : Zq,e  T2, j(M (A, B)) = (det(A), det(B)). Let N  Zq,e consist of all M (A, B) with det(A) = det(B) = 1 (so N is the kernel of j). On T2 we define (s, t) = (s, s2t-1), then j commutes with . We have the exact sequence

1  N  Zq,e --j T2  1

yielding the exact sequence

H1(N, )  H1(Zq,e, ) --j H1(T2, ).

Let G1, G2 be the subgroups of N consisting respectively of all M (A, 1) and

M (1, B) for A, B  SL(2, C). Then N = G1 × G2.

Let

A=

ab cd

,

then U AU -1 =

d¯ c¯ ¯b a¯

.

Thus

G1 =

M (A, 1) | A =

a¯ ¯b ¯b a¯

with aa¯ - b¯b = 1 .

We see that the group G1 is noncompact, and hence isomorphic to SL(2, R). We conclude that H1(G1, ) = 1.

Similarly write

B=

a c

b d

,

then V AV -1 =

a¯ c¯

¯b d¯

.

Hence G2 is equal to SL(2, R) and therefore H1(G2, ) = 1. We conclude that H1(N, ) = 1.
By the method of Section 5.3 it is straightforward to show that H1(T2, ) =
{[1], [T2(1, -1)]}.

Because the above sequence is exact it follows that j-1([1]) = {[1]}. We want

to determine j-1([T2(1, -1)]). Let B0 =

0i -i 0

and b = M (1, B0), then j(b) =

T (1, -1) and b  Z1(Zq,e, ). We twist the conjugation  by b, that is, we define

 (g) = b(g)b-1 for g  Zq,e. Then

 (M (A, B)) = M (U AU -1, det(A)(B)-T )

Then for g  G1 we have  (g) = (g) so that H1(G1,  ) = 1. For g = M (1, B)  G2 we have  (g) = M (1, (B)-T ). It follows that G2 = SU(2) and therefore H1(G2,  ) = {[1], [M (1, -1)]}. On T2 the twisted conjugation is equal to  because T2 is abelian. A short computation shows that

T2 = T2 = {(s, t) | s  R, t  C, s2 = tt}.

Consider c = (-1, 1)  T2 ; we compute [1] · c where the action is defined in

Construction 3.1.20.

Let

g

=

M(

10 0 -1

, 1)

so

that

j(g)

=

c.

Then  (g) =

M(

-1 0 01

, -1), and

[1] · c = [g-1 (g)] = [M (-1, -1)] = [M (1, -1)].

Hence T2 has only one orbit on H1(N,  ). It follows that j-1([T2(1, -1)]) = {[b]}. We conclude that H1(Zq,e, ) = {[1], [b]}. (24) ie147 is a real element in Y. We have

The group Zq,e consists of the elements M (A, B, C) where A, B, C  GL(2, C), det(A) det(B) det(C) = 1. For the conjugation  we have the following. Write

M (A, B, C) = M (

a22 a32

a23 a33

a55 a56 a65 a66

then the (M (A, B, C)) is

Let H be the subgroup of Zq,e consisting of the elements M (A, 1, 1) with det(A) = 1. Let H = GL(2, C) × GL(2, C). We define a homomorphism

 : Zq,e  H, M (A, B, C)  (B, C),

and we define the conjugation  on H in such a way that  commutes with . We obtain a short exact sequence

1  H  H  H  1.

We have

(H) =

( , ) | a55 a56 a65 a66

a¯66 a¯65 a¯56 a¯55

a55 a56 a65 a66

 GL(2, C)

whence H1(H, ) = 1 by Proposition 3.4.4(i). We have

 GL(2, C),

(H) 

a22 a23 a¯23 a¯22

| a22a¯22 - a23a¯23 = 1

.

We see that (H) is noncompact. Thus (H) is a noncompact real form of SL(2, C), and therefore (H)  SL(2, R) and H1(H, ) = 1. We conclude that
H1(Zq,e, ) = 1.
