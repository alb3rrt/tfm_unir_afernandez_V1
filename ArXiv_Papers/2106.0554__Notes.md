## Abstract

Recovering a signal (function) from finitely many binary or Fourier samples is one of the core problems in modern medical imaging, and by now there exist a plethora of methods for recovering a signal from such samples. Examples of methods, which can utilise wavelet reconstruction, include generalised sampling, infinite-dimensional compressive sensing, the parameterised-background data-weak (PBDW) method etc. However, for any of these methods to be applied in practice, accurate and fast modelling of an $N \times M$ section of the infinite-dimensional change-of-basis matrix between the sampling basis (Fourier or Walsh-Hadamard samples) and the wavelet reconstruction basis is paramount. In this work, we derive an algorithm, which bypasses the $NM$ storage requirement and the $\mathcal{O}(NM)$ computational cost of matrix-vector multiplication with this matrix when using Walsh-Hadamard samples and wavelet reconstruction. The proposed algorithm computes the matrix-vector multiplication in $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ operations and has a storage requirement of $\mathcal{O}(2^q)$, where $N=2^{dq} M$, (usually $q \in \{1,2\}$) and $d=1,2$ is the dimension. As matrix-vector multiplications is the computational bottleneck for iterative algorithms used by the mentioned reconstruction methods, the proposed algorithm speeds up the reconstruction of wavelet coefficients from Walsh-Hadamard samples considerably.
