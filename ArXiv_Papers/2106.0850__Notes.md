## Abstract

We show that the invariance of an entanglement measure under Stochastic Local Operations with Classical Communication (SLOCC) expands to its convex roof extension. SLOCC may be represented by Möbius transformations on the roots of the entanglement measure on the Bloch sphere. We derive efficient conditions for n-qubit states to be SLOCC-equivalent. We apply our approach on 4-qubit states and show that roots of the 3-tangle measure classify 4-qubit generic states. Moreover, we propose a method to obtain the normal form of a 4-qubit state which bypasses the possibly infinite iterative procedure.
