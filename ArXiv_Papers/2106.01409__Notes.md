## Abstract

We obtain a Disjoint Frequent Hypercyclicity Criterion and show that it characterizes disjoint frequent hypercyclicity for a family of unilateral pseudo-shifts on $c_0(\mathbb{N})$ and $\ell^p(\mathbb{N})$, $1\le p <\infty$. As an application, we characterize disjoint frequently hypercyclic weighted shifts. We give analogous results for the weaker notions of disjoint upper frequent and reiterative hypercyclicity. Finally, we provide counterexamples showing that, although the frequent hypercyclicity, upper frequent hypercyclicity, and reiterative hypercyclicity coincide for weighted shifts on $\ell^p(\mathbb{N})$, this equivalence fails for disjoint versions of these notions.
