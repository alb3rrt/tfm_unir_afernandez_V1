ABSTRACT

Simulated images of a black hole surrounded by optically thin emission typically display two main features: a central brightness depression and a narrow, bright "photon ring" consisting of strongly lensed images superposed on top of the direct emission. The photon ring closely tracks a theoretical curve on the image plane corresponding to light rays that asymptote to unstably bound photon orbits around the black hole. This critical curve has a size and shape that are purely governed by the Kerr geometry; in contrast, the size, shape, and depth of the observed brightness depression all depend on the details of the emission region. For instance, images of spherical accretion models display a distinctive dark region--the "black hole shadow"--that completely fills the photon ring. By contrast, in models of equatorial disks extending to the black hole's event horizon, the darkest region in the image is restricted to a much smaller area--an inner shadow--whose edge lies near the direct lensed image of the equatorial horizon. Using both semi-analytic models and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, we demonstrate that the photon ring and inner shadow may be simultaneously visible in submillimeter images of M87, where magnetically arrested disk (MAD) simulations predict that the emission arises in a thin region near the equatorial plane. We show that the relative size, shape, and centroid of the photon ring and inner shadow can be used to estimate the black hole mass and spin, breaking degeneracies in measurements of these quantities that rely on the photon ring alone. Both features may be accessible to direct observation via high-dynamic-range images with a next-generation Event Horizon Telescope.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has recently produced the first resolved images of a black hole (The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019a,b,c,d,e,f, 2021a,b). These 230 GHz images resolve the emission surrounding the supermassive black hole M87 ( = 6.5 ± 0.7 × 109  ; The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019f) at the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. The EHT resolution of  20 as ( 5  /2 for M87 at a distance   16.8 Mpc) only just reveals the horizon-scale structure in M87. The EHT images display a ring with a diameter of  40 as with a North-South brightness asymmetry and a relatively dim interior.
In models where the accretion flow onto a Kerr black hole is spherically symmetric and the emission is optically thin, the central brightness depression in the observed image coincides precisely with those light rays that terminate on the event horizon when traced backwards from the observer's image plane into the black hole spacetime (Falcke et al. 2000; Narayan et al. 2019). This dark region--the "black hole shadow"-- is bounded by a "critical curve" consisting of light rays that asymptote to unstably bound photon orbits around the black

hole (Bardeen 1973). Motivated by these models, the critical curve is sometimes also called the "shadow edge." Approaching the shadow edge, the path length through the emission region diverges logarithmically as null geodesics wrap around the black hole multiple times (Luminet 1979; Ohanian 1987; Gralla et al. 2019; Johnson et al. 2020; Gralla & Lupsasca 2020a). Hence, in models featuring a spherically symmetric and optically thin emission region, the image brightness also diverges logarithmically at the critical curve, resulting in a bright "photon ring" encircling the black hole shadow.
By contrast, in models where the emission region is confined to an equatorial disk that extends down to the event horizon, the edge of the observed central brightness depression does not generically correspond to the critical curve (e.g., Beckwith & Done 2005; Broderick & Loeb 2006; Gralla et al. 2019). Nevertheless, as long as the emission is optically thin, these models still feature a photon ring with logarithmically divergent brightness at the critical curve. Contrary to the case of spherical accretion, however, the brightness increase is not continuous; rather, it is broken up into a sequence of strongly lensed images of the disk stacked on top of each other. These images arise from rays with deflection angles > 180 deg that execute an increasing number of half-orbits around the black hole (Luminet 1979; Gralla et al. 2019; Johnson et al. 2020).
In reality, the hot ( > 1010 K), collisionless plasma that produces the submillimeter emission in M87 is expected to be turbulent, with a more complex structure than can be captured in either of these simple geometric pictures (Figure 1).

Figure 1. (Left) Snapshot image from a magnetically arrested radiative GRMHD simulation of M87 (Model R17; Chael et al. 2019), convolved with a circular Gaussian blurring kernel with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 15 as. The features of the simulated image at this resolution qualitatively match those seen in the first images of M87 from the EHT (The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019d). (Middle) The simulation snapshot at native resolution. The simulation is viewed at an inclination o = 163 deg (Mertens et al. 2016; The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019e); the black hole spin vector is oriented to the left and into the page. The snapshot image shows filamentary, turbulent structures, a central brightness depression, and a narrow, bright photon ring that closely tracks the theoretical critical curve (cyan curve). (Right) The same simulation snapshot in a gamma color scale that accentuates low-brightness features. In this scale, the central brightness depression corresponds to the black hole's inner shadow, or the direct lensed image of the equatorial event horizon (white curve). The EHT images released thus far do not resolve the inner shadow of M87, as they lack the requisite resolution and dynamic range. These requirements may be met with a next-generation EHT.

The primary numerical tools for investigating the structure and dynamics of hot accretion flows are general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations (e.g., Komissarov 1999; Gammie et al. 2003). To constrain the properties of M87, analyses of EHT images in both total intensity (The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019e,f) and in polarization (The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2021b) made use of a library of these GRMHD simulations spanning a range of different parameters, including the black hole spin, accumulated magnetic flux on the black hole, and ion-to-electron temperature ratio. Significantly, The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. (2021b) found that, among the GRMHD simulation models in the EHT library, the currently favored models for M87 all fall into the class of magnetically arrested disks (MADs; Narayan et al. 2003; Igumenshchev et al. 2003). In addition to producing images that are consistent with those observed by the EHT, MAD simulations naturally produce powerful jets (e.g., Tchekhovskoy et al. 2011; Chael et al. 2019) similar in both observed shape and total power to the prominent jet in M87 (e.g., Junor et al. 1999; Stawarz et al. 2006; Abramowski et al. 2012; Hada et al. 2016; Walker et al. 2018; EHT MWL Science Working Group et al. 2021).
Analyses of GRMHD simulation images have generally focused on the mathematical shadow edge, i.e., the critical curve (e.g., Dexter et al. 2012; Psaltis et al. 2015; Mocibrodzka et al. 2016; Bronzwaer et al. 2021). Because this curve only depends on the black hole mass and spin vector, inferring its size and shape would provide information about

the black hole's intrinsic parameters and enable tests of the validity of the Kerr metric (e.g., Takahashi 2004; Johannsen & Psaltis 2010; The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019f). However, in performing these tests with limitedresolution observations, it is critical to account for the systematic uncertainty in relating observed image features such as the emission ring and central brightness depression to gravitational properties such as the size and shape of the critical curve (e.g., The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019f; Bronzwaer et al. 2021). These systematic uncertainties may be dramatically reduced via future observations using an enhanced ground or space-based array capable of distinguishing lensed subrings within the photon ring (e.g., Johnson et al. 2020; Doeleman et al. 2019; Johnson et al. 2019; Pesce et al. 2019; Gralla et al. 2020; Broderick et al. 2021).
In this paper, we show that MAD models of M87 naturally exhibit a deep flux depression whose edge is contained well within the photon ring and critical curve. This darkest region in a MAD simulation image corresponds to rays that terminate on the event horizon before crossing the equatorial plane even once (Figure 2). We refer to this feature as the "inner shadow" of the black hole. This lensing feature was previously studied by Dokuchaev & Nazarova (2019, 2020a,b). As long as the emission is equatorial and extends all the way to the horizon, the darkest region in the observed image will correspond to the inner shadow, with a boundary defined by the direct, lensed image of the event horizon's intersection with the equatorial plane. The MAD GRMHD models that we consider satisfy these criteria, with their submillimeter emission originating

in the equatorial plane close to the event horizon (as seen in The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019e). Due to the effects of increasing gravitational redshift, the image brightness falls off rapidly near the edge of the inner shadow. As a result, the correspondence between the lensed image of the equatorial horizon and the edge of the central brightness depression in an image is only apparent in faint image features viewed at high dynamic range.
The inner shadow of a Kerr black hole has a significantly different dependence on its parameters than the critical curve (Takahashi 2004). For instance, the photon ring and critical curve of a Schwarzschild black hole are circular and independent of the viewing inclination, while the inner shadow is only circular when viewed face-on and has a size, shape, and centroid that are highly sensitive to the viewing inclination. The photon ring and inner shadow provide complementary information. When considered independently, each is subject to degeneracies in its size and shape as a function of black hole mass, spin, and viewing angle, yet these degeneracies can be broken via simultaneous observations of both features.
In simple toy models, spherical accretion flows produce a central brightness depression that completely fills the critical curve, but they do not give rise to an inner shadow (e.g., Falcke et al. 2000; Narayan et al. 2019). By contrast, thindisk accretion models with emission extending to the horizon and a large optical depth present a precisely observable inner shadow, but they do not display any visible feature near the critical curve, since the lensed images that would produce a photon ring are blocked by the optically thick disk (e.g., Beckwith & Done 2005, Figure 5.). As a result, past work has generally analyzed these two features independently under the expectation that only one or the other will be relevant to the observed image (see, e.g., Takahashi 2004; Dokuchaev & Nazarova 2020b). Remarkably, we find that in both GRMHD simulations with strong magnetic fields and in semi-analytic, optically thin disk models with a radially dependent emissivity, the photon ring and the inner shadow are both prominent as potentially observable features (Figure 1). Thus, in the future, it may become possible to simultaneously measure both features in images of a black hole and thereby derive tighter, joint constraints on its parameters.
In this paper, we explore how the inner shadow may appear in images from realistic simulations and models of M87, we assess the information contained in the relative size and shape of the inner shadow compared to the critical curve, and we discuss the prospects for direct observation of this feature using submillimeter very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). In section 2, we review the basic properties of null geodesics and radiative transfer in the Kerr spacetime that give rise to the photon ring and inner shadow. In section 3, we discuss the appearance of the inner shadow in images simulated from GRMHD and semi-analytic models. In section 4, we discuss geometric properties of both the critical curve and inner shadow, including their relative size, shape, and centroid positions, and we provide convenient analytic approximations for these quantities. Throughout the paper, we only consider the inner shadow arising from equatorial emission near the

event horizon of a Kerr black hole; in section 5 we discuss some of the factors--including jet emission, disk thickness and tilt, and alternative spacetime geometries--that could affect whether or how this feature appears in black hole images. We summarize our conclusions in section 6.

2. BLACK HOLE IMAGES
In this section, we review key features of the Kerr metric and the multiple lensed images of emission surrounding a black hole. We argue that the curve marking the direct image of the equatorial event horizon should be visible as the edge of an "inner shadow" if the emission region is sufficiently equatorial and extends down to the event horizon. From here on, we work in units normalized such that  =  = 1.

Unstable bound null geodesics, which neither escape to infinity nor intersect the event horizon, form a "photon shell" (Bardeen 1973; Teo 2003; Johnson et al. 2020) outside of the outer event horizon. Each bound orbit exists at a fixed Boyer-Lindquist radius c in the range c,-  c  c,+, where

Figure 2. (Left) Photon trajectories around the black hole that reach a distant observer located to the far right (see also Johannsen & Psaltis 2010; Gralla et al. 2019). The black hole is nonrotating ( = 0), with an event horizon at + = 2 (black disk) and a photon sphere at c = 3 (dashed yellow circle). Photon trajectories are colored according to the number of times they cross the equatorial plane (green line), which is inclined at o = 17 deg from the observer. Most trajectories cross the equatorial plane once (blue), but photons that appear close to the critical curve on the image plane wrap around the black hole and cross the plane twice (purple), three times (red), or more, with photons appearing
exactly on the critical curve describing trajectories that asymptote to unstably bound orbits ruling the photon sphere. The inner shadow is defined by the trajectories that do not cross the equatorial plane (max = 0) before intersecting the event horizon (black disk). (Right) The maximum number of equatorial crossings max for null geodesics as a function of the coordinates (, ) in the image plane for a black hole of spin  = 0 observed at an inclination angle of o = 17 deg. Rings with an increasing number of equatorial crossings max become increasingly narrow and exponentially approach the critical curve (dashed yellow circle). Inside the contour of the lensed equatorial horizon (solid white line),
light rays do not cross the equatorial plane even once. In models of equatorial emission extending to the horizon, these rays are therefore dark, resulting in an "inner shadow" feature. The "unlensed" outline of the event horizon + = 2 is indicated with the dotted white line.

2.2. Lensed images and the critical curve

where R () and () are the radial and angular potentials

We consider a distant observer (o  ) viewing the black hole at an inclination angle 0  o <  with respect to its spin axis. We parameterize the observer's image plane using "Bardeen coordinates" (, ), given in units of , defined such that the  axis corresponds to the black hole spin axis projected onto the plane perpendicular to the "line of sight."
Each point in the image plane is associated with a null geodesic extending into the Kerr spacetime and labeled by two conserved quantities: the energy-rescaled angular momentum  and Carter constant . For a point (, ) in the image plane, these constants are

By integrating the null geodesic equation 8, we can solve for the trajectory  () through the Kerr spacetime of a photon shot back from position (, ) on the observer's image plane.
Such trajectories can be divided into three classes: those that eventually cross the event horizon (photon capture), those that are deflected by the black hole but return to infinity (photon escape), and those that asymptote to unstable bound orbits around the black hole. The latter form a closed curve (c, c) in the image plane--the critical curve--delineating the region of photon capture (the curve's interior) from that of photon escape (its exterior). Critical photons have conserved quantities (c, c) equal to those of a photon on a bound orbit. For a given photon orbit radius c,-  c  c,+, these are

Figure 3. Analytic models of emission from a Kerr black hole's equatorial plane covering a range of black hole spins and observer inclinations. Columns from left to right display models with dimensionless spins  = (0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.99) and rows from top to bottom display inclinations o = (0, 30, 60, 89) deg. The intensity in each panel is normalized independently: all images are plotted in a gamma color scale with index  = 1/4. For each model, we show the critical curve (cyan), the direct (primary,  = 0) lensed image of the equatorial horizon (solid white) and
the backside (secondary,  = 1) lensed image of the equatorial horizon (dashed white).

The critical curve in the image plane is obtained by inverting Equation 7 to find (, ) for all c,-  c  c,+. Each bound photon orbit at constant radius c maps to two points in the image plane corresponding to the two signs ± allowed for a given pair (, ). As a result, the critical curve is symmetric about the  axis perpendicular to the projected spin.
The interior of the critical curve corresponds to geodesics that connect the observer to the event horizon and is often referred to as the "black hole shadow." This name is motivated by the observation that, for a black hole that is immersed within an optically thin accretion flow with a spherically sym-

metric emissivity, light rays inside the critical curve (which terminate on the horizon) have a shorter path length along which to accumulate brightness than those in the exterior (which extend to infinity and can pick up more photons as they pass through the emission region); as a result, in such configurations, the critical curve's interior displays a brightness depression (Falcke et al. 2000; Narayan et al. 2019).
Tracing back from the image plane, light rays that originate very near the critical curve approach the photon shell of bound orbits and execute many oscillations in  between the turning points ± (Equation A4) before either terminating

6

C ,J

on the event horizon or escaping to infinity. The number of oscillations (and the path length of the null geodesic) diverge logarithmically as the image-plane coordinate approaches a point on the critical curve. If the black hole is surrounded by a uniform, optically thin emission region, this divergence in path length manifests as a logarithmic increase in the image brightness surrounding the critical curve: the "photon ring" (Johnson et al. 2020; Gralla & Lupsasca 2020a).
If instead the black hole has an optically thin emission region that does not fully surround it (e.g., one concentrated near the equatorial plane, in a tilted plane, or in a "jet sheath" region), then each oscillation in  corresponds to an additional pass of the null geodesic through the emission region. In this case, the photon ring is still present but exhibits additional substructure: its brightness profile increases in steps, forming exponentially narrow subrings that converge to the critical curve, with each ring assigned a label  corresponding to the number  - 1 of passes its light rays execute through the emission region (Johnson et al. 2020).

2.3. Equatorial images and the lensed horizon
We now focus on emission that is concentrated in the black hole's equatorial plane ( = /2). A geodesic ending at position (, ) in the image plane crosses the equatorial plane a maximum number of times max (, ) outside of the event horizon (an analytic procedure from Gralla & Lupsasca (2020a) for calculating the equatorial crossings is reviewed in Appendix A; in particular, see Equation A14). In most of the image plane, max = 1; that is, geodesics cross the equator only once and project a direct (but still lensed) image of the equatorial emission on the observer sky. In parts of the image plane that form increasingly narrow rings around the black hole, we instead have max = 2, 3, . . . These concentric regions are the "lensed subrings" carrying contributions from geodesics that wrap around the black hole and cross its equatorial plane multiple times. Figure 2 shows how max varies across the image plane for the case of a Schwarzschild black hole viewed at o = 17 deg.
For each 0   < max (, ), one can calculate the radius eq (, ; ) where the geodesic impinging on the observer's image plane at position (, ) crosses the equatorial plane for the ( + 1)th time. This computation can be done either analytically (e.g., using the analytic method described in Gralla & Lupsasca (2020a) and reviewed in Appendix A) or numerically (e.g., using a GR ray tracing code like grtrans (Dexter 2016) or ipole (Mocibrodzka & Gammie 2018)).
One can also invert eq (, ; ) to determine the successive lensed images of equatorial circles of constant source radius s = eq. These contours are convex curves in the image plane and can be described in image-plane polar coordinates (, )

,L

as curves (; s, ) with -   <  defined by
eq ( =  cos ,  =  sin ;  = 0) = s, (12)
For any fixed radius s  +, the curves (; s, ) approach the critical curve exponentially fast with increasing . For small observing angles o  0, the  = 0 image of an equatorial ring of constant radius s is lensed by approximately one gravitational radius; that is,   s +  (Gralla & Lupsasca 2020a; Gates et al. 2020).
While most of the image plane has max  1, it also has a small region with max = 0 wherein geodesics do not cross the equatorial plane even once, but instead pierce the event horizon before ever reaching  = /2 (right panel of Figure 2). This max = 0 region corresponds exactly to the interior of the direct ( = 0) lensed image of the equatorial event horizon, and is therefore bounded by the curve

h () = (; +, 0),

(13)

defined by Equation 12 with s = +. Like the critical curve, this curve divides the image plane into two qualitatively distinct regions. Inside the critical curve, all geodesics terminate on the event horizon, while inside h (), all geodesics terminate on the horizon without crossing the equator (left panel of Figure 2). Thus, if the black hole is surrounded by an emission region that is predominantly equatorial and extends all the way down to the horizon, we should expect the interior of h () to show up as a dark region in the image, thereby forming an "inner shadow" of low brightness.
In Figure 3, we plot the critical curve c () and the direct, lensed equatorial horizon image h () for a range of black hole spins and observer inclinations, on top of an image generated from the analytic model described in subsection 3.2 below. In this model, the emission is purely equatorial and extends to the horizon; thus, the interior of h ()--the black hole's "inner shadow"-- is visible in each image as a deep brightness depression contained within the critical curve.

3. MODELS FOR M87

In this section, we investigate the appearance of the lensed
equatorial horizon in images of synchrotron emission from a radiative GRMHD simulation of M87. We find that the
lensed horizon image is visible in GRMHD simulation images of this magnetically arrested disk model for M87 because its
emission region is primarily equatorial. We compare images
from the simulation with images from an analytic model that
assumes all emission originates in the equatorial plane. We scale all images of M87 throughout this paper so that
the angular gravitational size is (The Event Horizon Telescope
Collaboration et al. 2019f)



= 3.78 as.

(14)



Following Johnson et al. (2020), we assign a number  to each subring such that light rays appearing on that ring describe at least  librations in , or at least  + 1 passes through the emission region. Thus,  = 0 refers to the "direct image" formed by rays passing through the emission region once.

We take the polar angle  = 0 in the image plane to lie along the + axis:  =  cos ,  =  sin . Because the lensed images of equatorial rings are convex curves containing the origin, there is a unique  satisfying this equation for each   [- , ), so the curves ( ; s, ) are well-defined.

(Right) Equatorial slice of the simulation emissivity proxy (solid), compared with the emissivity profile used in the analytic model (dashed), both normalized to unity at the horizon. The simulation emissivity proxy is concentrated in the equatorial plane and does not truncate at the ISCO, but rather continues increasing with decreasing radius all the way to the event horizon.

We also scale the total flux density at 230 GHz to 0.6 Jy (The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019c).
3.1. Radiative GRMHD simulation
In this paper, we consider images of a radiative GRMHD simulation of M87; specifically, we use simulation R17 from Chael et al. (2019). This simulation was performed using the radiative GRMHD code KORAL (Sdowski et al. 2013, 2014, 2017). Unlike most GRMHD codes, which evolve a single combined electron-ion fluid and must apply a model for the electron-to-ion temperature ratio in post-processing, the KORAL code directly evolves the temperature of the emitting electrons under radiative cooling and dissipative heating. The primary cooling mechanism in the simulation is from synchrotron radiation at submillimeter wavelengths. The electron heating fraction in the simulation is provided by the Rowan et al. (2017) subgrid prescription fit to simulations of collisionless, transrelativistic magnetic reconnection.
The simulation used a black hole mass of  = 6.2×109  and spin  = 0.9375. The initial magnetic field was set up so that the magnetic flux saturates on the black hole, putting the system in the magnetically arrested (MAD) accretion state (Igumenshchev et al. 2003; Narayan et al. 2003; Tchekhovskoy et al. 2011). Polarimetric EHT observations of M87 favor this accretion state over one with weaker, turbulent magnetic fields (The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2021b). The simulation produces a relativistic jet of power  1043 erg s-1, satisfying measurements of the
Note that the simulation images used here originally had an average flux density of  1 Jy based on observations of M87 prior to 2017 (Akiyama et al. 2015). Here, we have scaled down the simulation's total flux density to match the updated value that better fits the 2017 EHT images.

jet power from M87 (e.g., Stawarz et al. 2006). Furthermore, the jet opening angle in 43 GHz images from this simulation is large. When observed at an inclination angle o = 163 deg (Mertens et al. 2016), the apparent opening angle is  50 deg, similar to that observed in VLBI images of M87 (Walker et al. 2018). The extended jet in the simulation is in steady-state out to  2500   1 pc, while the disk in the midplane is in steady-state out to  40 .
The GRMHD simulation is turbulent and time-variable. To investigate the persistent features of the GRMHD fluid data, we computed profiles of the key plasma quantities (e.g., the density , electron temperature e, magnetic field , and velocity ) in the poloidal (, ) plane after averaging in time and azimuth. We also generated images of the 230 GHz and 86 GHz synchrotron emission from this simulation using the GR ray tracing and radiative transfer code grtrans (Dexter 2016). The images were generated at an observer inclination angle of o = 163 deg and rotated so that the black hole spin points to the East, opposite to the direction of the approaching jet (The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019e). The snapshot images from this simulation exhibit small-scale structure from plasma turbulence and magnetic filaments (Figure 1). In this paper, we focus on time-averaged images generated from the collection of snapshot images of the simulation; both the time-averaged images and the time-averaged simulation data were produced from simulation snapshots spanning 5000  in time at a cadence of 10 .
Radiatively inefficient simulations with weak magnetic flux form geometrically thick disks supported by the gas pressure. By contrast, in the high-magnetic-flux MAD state, the magnetic pressure exceeds the gas pressure in the "disk" near the black hole. In the time-averaged simulation data, the nearhorizon material forms a thin, highly magnetized structure

Figure 5. (Left) Equatorial value of the specific angular momentum    / taken from the time- and azimuth-averaged simulation data (black curve). At all radii, the averaged simulation angular momentum is well below the Keplerian value (red dashed curve).

(Right) Equatorial value of the covariant infall velocity  =  / taken from the averaged simulation data (black curve). We fit the average simulation data with a broken power law (dotted green curve, Equation 20).

in the equatorial plane; this thin structure is the source of the observed 230 GHz emission. Note that the thickness of the equatorial "disk" in these simulations is limited by the resolution; in very-high-resolution simulations, the emission region is even thinner, and it occasionally collapses to a current sheet that may source very high energy emission (e.g., Ripperda et al. 2020).
In Figure 4, we investigate the 230 GHz emissivity from the time- and azimuth-averaged R17 simulation data. The true rest frame emissivity used in the radiative transfer (e.g., that given in Appendix A1 of Dexter 2016) depends on the combined special-relativistic and gravitational redshift of the geodesic at the source, as well as the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the wavevector in the fluid rest frame. As a result, it is nontrivial to directly extract an emissivity profile from the time-averaged simulation data that would correspond meaningfully to the time-averaged images generated by grtrans. Here, we use the proxy for the 230 GHz emissivity defined in the EHT GRMHD code comparison project (Porth et al. 2019). This function follows the characteristic behavior of the true synchrotron emissivity (e.g., Leung et al. 2011) with the density , electron pressure e, and magnetic field strength ||. The emissivity proxy is

We follow Porth et al. (2019) in setting the free constant  = 0.2 so that the 230 GHz emission is contained within a characteristic radius em  5 .
From the left panel of Figure 4, it is apparent that near the black hole, the emissivity proxy predicts that emission from the Chael et al. (2019) simulation is predominately located in the equatorial plane. In the right panel, we extract the simulation emissivity in the equatorial plane ( = /2) and compare with the emissivity function we use in the analytic model described in the next section, Equation 17. The simulation emissivity satisfies two criteria necessary for the lensed equatorial event horizon, or black hole inner shadow, to be visible as an image feature at 230 GHz:
1. The simulation emissivity is predominately concentrated in the equatorial plane (Figure 4, left panel).
2. The simulation emissivity extends to the event horizon, and is not truncated at any earlier radius such as the innermost stable circular orbit (Figure 4, right panel).
We also investigate the time-averaged simulation velocity profile in the equatorial plane. Figure 5 shows profiles of the specific angular momentum    / and covariant infall velocity  =  / computed from the average simulation data. Notably, the average angular momentum in the equatorial plane is significantly below the Keplerian value at all radii (as also seen in, e.g., Narayan et al. 2003). These sub-Keplerian velocities significantly reduce the total Doppler+gravitational redshift factor for emission close to

Both the 230 GHz and 86 GHz analytic model images had the parameters in their emissivity profile (Equation 17) separately fixed to best match the corresponding simulation images. The black hole spin (positive  axis) points to the left, as indicated by the arrow in the left column images. Each panel displays the critical curve (cyan) and the direct image of the equatorial horizon (white line). In the left column, we also indicate the centroid of the critical curve (cyan square marker), the centroid of the direct equatorial horizon image (white circular marker), and the origin ( = 0,  = 0) of the Bardeen coordinate system (white cross).

the event horizon. As a result of this reduced redshift factor, the brightness of the emission falls off less severely near the lensed horizon curve than it would in a Keplerian model with infall inside the ISCO (e.g, Cunningham 1975).
3.2. Equatorial emission model
Because the time-averaged emissivity of the GRMHD simulation is predominantly equatorial (Figure 4), it is reasonable to compare time-averaged images from this simulation with those from a simple model with the emission confined to the equatorial plane. Gralla et al. (2020) introduced a convenient, analytic model for computing images of equatorial emission around a black hole. These images are specified by the black hole spin  and observer inclination o (which determine the lensed subring structure), the four-velocity of the emitting material in the equatorial plane  () (which determines the redshift of the emission), and the rest-frame emissivity in the equatorial plane model (). The emissivity and velocity are assumed to be constant in azimuth.
In this model, the observed intensity at a point (, ) on the image plane is

where  = eq (, ; ) is the radius at which the geodesic crosses the equatorial plane for the ( + 1)th time (see subsection 2.3), max = max (, ) is the maximum number of equatorial crossings, model () is the equatorial emissivity at , and  is the redshift factor computed from the emitted
photon wavevector   and the four-velocity  of the emitting
material at radius . The factor  is a "fudge" that can en-
hance or diminish the brightness of higher-order rings: we set 0 = 1 and  = 2/3 for  > 0 to best match the time-averaged images from the radiative GRMHD simulation.
Note that while Equation 16 is of the same general form introduced in Gralla et al. (2020), we use a factor of 3 to
represent the redshift of the specific 230 GHz intensity (as-
suming a flat emssion spectrum in Equation 17) rather than the 4 redshift factor they use for bolometric intensity. We also use a "fudge" factor  < 1 for  > 0, while Gralla et al. (2020) uses  = 1.5, as we find it necessary to slightly suppress the contributions from higher-order subrings to match
our model images to the time-averaged simulation images
used here. For the emissivity model (), we use a second-order poly-
nomial in log-space; that is,

Figure 7. Slices along the  = 0 (red) and  = 0 axes (blue) of the time-averaged 230 GHz images from the M87 GRMHD simulation (solid curves) and the corresponding analytic equatorial disk model (dashed curves). Solid vertical lines indicate the exact location of the direct image of the equatorial horizon on these slices. An approximate dynamic range for the EHT2017 array is indicated by the cyan horizontal line, while the width of the cyan rectangle shows one-half the nominal resolution of the 2017 array. Likewise, the dynamic range for an ngEHT concept array is indicated by the magenta line, and the magenta rectangle indicates one-half of the ngEHT concept's nominal resolution. In the time-averaged simulation image, the brightness inside the lensed horizon contour levels off at a finite floor value produce by foreground jet emission. In this simulation, the position of this dark depression inside the main emission ring--the "inner shadow"--coincides with the image of the lensed equatorial horizon to within a microarcsecond. In this model, the photon ring contains  10% of the total flux in the image.

For the 230 GHz images shown throughout this paper, we set 1 = -2, and 2 = -1/2. The overall scale of the emissivity in Equation 17 is arbitrary; in computing images of M87, we normalize the emission so that the 230 GHz flux density is 0.6 Jy (The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019c). The right panel of Figure 4 compares the parametrization from Equation 17 to the equatorial emissivity profile from the time-averaged GRMHD simulation (Equation 15).

Note that for the analytic model to match the change in the image structure with frequency observed in the GRMHD simulation, the emissivity profile parameters must change with the observation frequency; in the 86 GHz images in Figure 6, we set 1 = 0, 2 = -3/4.

3.3. 230 GHz and 86 GHz images
Figure 6 compares time-averaged images from the M87 simulation at 230 and 86 GHz with images generated using the modified analytic model described in subsection 3.2. We see that the direct lensed image of the equatorial event horizon is apparent as a deep central brightness depression--the inner shadow--in both the time-averaged images from the simulation and the equatorial model. The brightness of the emission surrounding the horizon image is suppressed by the gravitational redshift; nonetheless, when looking at the image

B HI
in a gamma color scale (bottom row of Figure 6), the apparent edge of the central brightness depression in the simulation and model image approaches the exact location of the lensed equatorial horizon contour within a microarcsecond.
At 86 GHz, the increasing optical depth of the accretion flow washes out the images of the higher-order ( = 1, 2, . . .) subrings in the simulation image, except for part of the  = 1 ring on the north half of the image. We mimic this effect in the image from the analytic equatorial model by suppressing the higher-order rings and only showing the direct,  = 0 emission. Despite the optical depth suppressing the appearance of the lensed subrings, the central "inner shadow" depression is still visible at 86 GHz. This is because in the simulation, the emitting material contributing to the increased total optical depth is still contained within the equatorial plane; the optical depth through the jet material in front of the event horizon remains low. As a result, the direct geometrical effect of the equatorial emission being truncated at the event horizon is still visible at this frequency. At lower frequencies (< 40 GHz in this simulation), the jet material becomes optically thick and obscures both the equatorial emission and the inner shadow. The transition between the optically thick opaque jet and optically thin transparent jet regimes occurs at the frequency above which the image "core" no longer moves along the jet, but rather stabilizes at the location of the black hole (Hada et al. 2016; Chael et al. 2019, Figure 11).
3.4. Observability with the EHT
In Figure 7, we show profiles from the simulation and analytic model 230 GHz images in Figure 6 extracted along the  = 0 (red; North-South) and  = 0 (blue; East-West) axes. The time-averaged simulation image and the equatorial model image show the same characteristic features: a ring of direct  = 0 emission that peaks at a radius of  15 - 20 as from the origin,  = 1 and  = 2 subring images that approach the critical curve at a radius of  20 as, and a central brightness depression corresponding to the lensed image of the equatorial horizon, i.e., an inner shadow. The exact position of the horizon image on these slices is indicated by the vertical lines. The equatorial analytic model has no emission outside the equatorial plane; its brightness plunges toward zero with increasing redshift as the projected radius approaches the direct lensed image h () of the equatorial horizon on the sky. The simulation image features faint foreground emission from the approaching relativistic jet which lies in front of the bulk of the emission in the equatorial plane. The approaching jet provides a finite brightness "floor" inside the main  = 0 emission ring. In this simulation, the edges of the floor correspond to the analytic location of the horizon image to within about a microarcsecond. In other simulations, the exact location of the emission floor will depend on the equatorial emissivity profile, the velocity/redshift of the equatorial fluid, and the intensity of the foreground emission.
In the gamma scale,   is plotted in the linear color scale instead of  , where  is the image brightness and we set  = 1/4.

The cyan line on Figure 7 indicates the dynamic range of the EHT in 2017; the limited interferometric (, ) coverage of the array in this first observation of M87 makes it impossible to extract dim features below  10% of the peak brightness (The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019d). The magenta line is an approximate forecast for the dynamic range of the next-generation EHT (ngEHT) array (Doeleman et al. 2019; Raymond et al. 2021). With the addition of new sites and short interferometric baselines, the dynamic range of the ngEHT array should improve to be sensitive to emission that is a factor 10-3 dimmer than the beam emission. In this simulation, the emission "floor" that fills the lensed horizon image is a factor of 10-2 dimmer than the peak of the emission. As a result, in this scenario, we would expect an ngEHT array with improved coverage to be able to directly image the inner shadow feature down to the floor set by the foreground emission.
In Figure 8, we investigate the ability of the EHT and ngEHT arrays to recover the inner shadow feature with simulated image reconstructions. We generate synthetic VLBI data from the time-averaged 230 GHz simulation image using the (, ) coverage on 2017 April 11 (The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019d). We also generate a synthetic ngEHT observation using an example array explored in Raymond et al. (2021). This ngEHT concept array adds 12 telescopes to the current EHT, dramatically filling in the EHT's (, ) coverage and increasing its imaging dynamic range. In both cases, we generated synthetic data including thermal noise and completely randomized station phases from atmospheric turbulence. We did not include the time-variable amplitude gain errors that complicate real EHT imaging (The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019c,d).
The left column of Figure 8 shows the simulation image blurred to half of the nominal ngEHT resolution at 230 GHz (using a circular Gaussian blurring kernel of 10 as FWHM). The middle column shows the reconstruction from EHT2017 synthetic data, and the right column shows the ngEHT reconstruction. Both reconstructions were performed using the eht-imaging library (Chael et al. 2018); in particular, the settings used in imaging the 2017 data were the same as those used in eht-imaging in the first publication of the M87 results in The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. (2019d). While the EHT2017 reconstruction shows a central brightness depression, its size and brightness contrast cannot be constrained or associated with the inner shadow. However, the increased (, ) coverage of the ngEHT array dramatically increases the dynamic range, and the image reconstruction recovers the position and size of the high-dynamic-range "inner shadow" depression that is visible in the simulation image blurred to the equivalent resolution.
This imaging test is idealized. First, neither the ngEHT nor EHT2017 directly image the time-averaged structure in M87, so an imaging test using a GRMHD snapshot would be more realistic. However, the inner shadow is prominent in simulation snapshots as well as in the time-averaged image (Figure 1). Furthermore, we neglect realistic station amplitude gains and polarimetric leakage factors that complicate

image inversion from EHT data. However, M87 is weakly polarized, making accurate recovery of the total intensity image possible with no leakage correction (The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019d, 2021a), and image reconstruction of EHT data with even very large amplitude gain factors is possible with a relatively small degradation of the reconstruction quality using eht-imaging (Chael et al. 2018).
This example demonstrates that the candidate ngEHT array from Raymond et al. (2021) could constrain the presence of an inner shadow in M87 if it is indeed present in the image. In particular, detecting this feature does not require dramatic increases in imaging resolution (which, in the absence of a 230 GHz VLBI satellite, is limited by the size of the Earth) but by the imaging dynamic range, which is limited by the sparse number of baselines in the EHT array. Once its presence is established via imaging, parametric visibility domain modeling could recover the size and shape of the inner shadow to higher accuracy than is possible from imaging alone (e.g., The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019f).

In this section, we describe the behavior of the lensed equatorial horizon contour as a function of black hole spin and observer inclination using image moments. While not a complete description of the horizon image shape (particularly at high inclination), the moment description captures important properties of the horizon image that may be observable by the EHT or future VLBI experiments.
In the procedure outlined in subsection 2.3, we compute the  = 0 lensed horizon image as a closed curve h () in the (, ) image plane. Given h, we can compute image moments in a standard way (explicitly described in Appendix B). The zeroth moment is the area h of the inner shadow. The first moment is the centroid vector h defined with respect to the (, ) axes. The second central moment is the covariance matrix h. By diagonalizing h, we can compute the lengths h and h of the principal axes (where h  h), as well as the orientation angle h between the first principal axis and the positive  axis. We can then define the mean radius ¯h and the eccentricity h of the lensed horizon as

Figure 9. Relative centroid displacement (, ) of the direct
equatorial horizon image with respect to the critical curve. For all values of black hole spin and inclination, sign() = sign()
and sign() = sign(cos o). An abrupt transition occurs at o = 90 deg, where the  = 0 and  = 1 equatorial horizon images are degenerate. The mapping (, o)  (, ) is one-to-one and fairly linear up to high spin and nearly edge-on inclination.

In addition to computing these image moments for the lensed horizon, we also compute the area, centroid, average radius, eccentricity, and orientation angle of the critical curve (c, c, ¯c, c, c). Note that our definition of the average critical curve radius ¯c differs from that introduced in Johannsen & Psaltis (2010). In Appendix B, Figure 16, we compare results for the average critical curve radius from these two methods and find that they agree within one percent for all values of black hole spin and observer inclination.
4.1. Centroid
In Figure 9, we plot the relative centroid displacement between the lensed horizon and the critical curve  = h - c. Measuring the absolute centroid displacement of either the lensed horizon or the critical curve would require precise prior knowledge of the location of the black hole on the sky; by contrast, the relative centroid displacement  could in principle be observed by simply measuring the two curves and determining the direction of the black hole spin to set the orientation of the + axis (in M87, for instance, these axes can be inferred from the direction of the large-scale jet).
The critical curve is symmetric about the  = 0 axis for all values of spin and inclination, so the vertical displacement  is purely due to the offset of the inner shadow's centroid. The direction of the vertical offset is set by the hemisphere that the observer lies in: sign() = sign(cos o).

S

Both the critical curve and the lensed horizon image have
a horizontal displacement  that is approximately linear with spin. The sign of this displacement follows that of the spin: sign() = sign(). In general, the mapping (, o)  (, ) is one-to-one and fairly linear up to high spin and nearly edge-on inclination. There is an abrupt transition in  at o = 90 deg, where the  = 0 and  = 1 images are degenerate.
The geometric centroids of the inner shadow and the critical
curve are well approximated by

by  20% from zero to maximal spin. Figure 11 shows, for

0.50

several fixed values of the black hole spin, the dependence on

inclination of the ratio ¯h/¯c of the lensed horizon mean radius to the critical curve mean radius. Again, for o 30 deg, ¯h/¯c is approximately independent of the inclination and hence provides a direct measurement of the spin. In the low inclination case, ¯h/¯c shrinks from  55% at zero spin to  45% at maximal spin. Importantly, measuring ¯h/¯c for an astrophysical black hole would not require accurate
measurements of the black hole mass  or distance .
Referencing the lensed horizon image directly to the crit-
ical curve would require detecting a lensed subring of order  1, which for M87 only becomes visible on very high resolution baselines 20 G (Johnson et al. 2020). However, it should be possible to constrain the location of the critical curve with measurements of the  = 0 and  = 1 rings by determining systematic calibration factors (and associated
systematic uncertanties) that relate size of the EHT image to
the critical curve size in a library of astrophysical models,
as was done in The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. (2019e,f) to measure the mass of M87. Alternatively,
parametric modeling with priors on the image structure may constrain the  = 1 and higher subring images from measurements at lower spatial frequencies rings using parametric
model fits (Broderick et al. 2020).
For all spins at low and moderate inclinations, the lensed
horizon image is well approximated by an ellipse, and the first

three image moments give a fairly complete description of
the curve. At higher inclinations, the structure becomes more
complex, with more information in the full curve shape than is captured in the first three moments. In particular, at  = 0 and o = 90 deg, the horizon image becomes a semicircle, degenerate with the  = 1 horizon image semicircle in the other half plane (at higher spins, the image is not a perfect semicircle, but is still a mirror image of the degenerate  = 1 image; see Figure 3). In this case, the curve is probably better described by the single radius of the combined  = 0 and  = 1 circle, rather than the second moment parameters of just the  = 0 image.

of the radius of the critical curve and the lensed horizon could

be used to constrain the mass and spin in M87 when the inclination is fixed at o = 17 deg (Mertens et al. 2016). These simultaneous constraints are analogous to those discussed
in Broderick et al. (2021), which considers constraints from
measuring multiple lensed images from a single face-on emit-
ting ring. The blue line shows the space of mass-to-distance ratios / and spins  that give the same mean lensed horizon radius for an image of M87; the red line shows the
same for the critical curve. The red and blue lines intersect
in only one location corresponding to the input black hole mass / = 3.78 as and spin  = 0.94. The shaded bands around the intersecting lines show absolute errors in the radius measurements of 0.1, 0.5, 1 as. Given a reported EHT radius measurement uncertainty of 1.5 as from geometric modeling of the EHT2017 data in The Event Horizon Telescope
Collaboration et al. (2019f), measurements of the ring and inner shadow radius and centroid locations at 1 as precision may be feasible with the ngEHT. In addition to reducing
uncertainty in the image size measurement itself, precisely
constraining both features will depend on reducing system-
atic uncertainty in the relationship between the gravitational
features and images from a set of plausible astrophysical mod-
els (e.g., The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al.
2019f).
The right panel of Figure 12 shows a similar figure for a
simultaneous measurement of the centroid offset along the 
(, in green) and  axes (, in orange). Because the centroid offsets are relatively small, an absolute error of 1 as in the measurement of the centroid offsets is less constraining
than the corresponding radius measurement. However, measuring the offset  to 1 as precision could put a lower limit on the spin  0.5 independent of the mass. Measurements that jointly constrain the image size and eccentricity could even more precisely constrain the mass and spin in M87.
In Sgr A, the mass-to-distance ratio is known to high precision, / = 5.011 ± 0.016 as (Gravity Collaboration et al. 2019), but the inclination is unconstrained. In Figure 13, we show similar simultaneous constraints on o and  for Sgr Afrom measurements of the inner shadow and critical
curve radii (left panel) and centroid offset (right panel). The
inner shadow and critical curve radii poorly constrain the
inclination, and constraining the spin with these radii and an
unknown inclination requires a measurement precision finer than 1 as. By contrast, as discussed in subsection 4.1, the centroid offset is highly constraining of both o and  if / is known (right panel of Figure 13). Note that the constraints
shown in the right panels of Figure 12 and Figure 13 require
the  and  axes to be known a priori; in practice, this could be informed with reference to the jet at large scales in M87,
or by reference to the location of the brightness asymmetry from Doppler beaming in 230 GHz images of M87 or Sgr A.
Figure 12 and Figure 13 are idealized examples; in practice,
the orientation of the  and  axes would likely have to be fit to observations along with , o, and other model parameters that relate the critical curve and lensed equatorial
horizon shapes to their corresponding features in the observed

,L

image (e.g., the emissivity and redshift profiles in the model described in subsection 3.2).

4.3. Semi-analytic description of the lensed horizon
Here, we attempt to derive an approximate parameterization for the general shape of the lensed equatorial event horizon, starting with a nonrotating ( = 0) Schwarzschild black hole. As is the case for the critical curve, such approximations are useful for easily exploring the behavior of the shape with spin and inclination and to identify parameter degeneracies (e.g., de Vries 2003; Cunha & Herdeiro 2018; Farah et al. 2020; Gralla & Lupsasca 2020b). Gates et al. (2020) provide an analytic formula for the equatorial radius eq (, , o; ) that a light ray shot back from position (, ) on the image plane will cross on its ( + 1)th equatorial crossing. While the dependence of this transfer function on the impact radius  is rather complicated, its dependence on the impact angle  and observer inclination o only enter through the particular combination

 = arctan [sin () tan (o)] .

(26)

In this paper, we are only interested in the direct image  = 0. It is tempting to expand

eq (, ;  = 0) =  0 () -  1 () + O 2 , (27)

where  0 () = eq (,  = 0;  = 0) is the exact, axisymmetric transfer function for a polar observer at  = o = 0. Gates et al. (2020) derive its asymptotic expansion in large
impact radius   ,

Inverting Eq. (27) results in an expression of the form

which unfortunately is not as good an approximation as its inverse (27). In particular, this expansion breaks down at large inclination, where the higher-order terms in  grow more relevant. Nonetheless, we empirically observe that an excellent semi-analytic fit to the lensed equatorial horizon

Lensed images with higher  lie in the photon ring, and one may set up a large- expansion as in Gralla & Lupsasca (2020a) to obtain a simple asymptotic formula for eq (, ; ) given in App. A of Hadar et al. (2021).

5. DISCUSSION
Images from the radiative GRMHD simulations of M87 from Chael et al. (2019) display a deep central brightness depression. For these simulations of synchrotron-emitting plasma around a Kerr black hole, the edge of this image feature is the lensed image of the event horizon's intersection with the equatorial plane; the brightness depression is the

"inner shadow" of the black hole. Because the gravitational redshift diverges for emission approaching the event horizon, this inner shadow is only visible at high dynamic range in the simulation images. Nonetheless, if it is present in M87 images, this feature could be observable with the nextgeneration Event Horizon Telescope, which will increase the dynamic range of the current EHT by a factor of  100.
An inner shadow bounded by the image of the equatorial event horizon is only visible in images of a black hole if the emission region
1. is concentrated in the equatorial plane,
2. is not obscured by foreground emission (e.g., from the approaching jet), and
3. extends to the event horizon.
This scenario is realized by 230 GHz emission from the MAD simulations of M87 considered in this paper; however, there are other plausible scenarios for the distribution of emitting plasma.
If the emission is spherically symmetric and extends to the horizon, the direct outline of the horizon is not visible; the only brightness depression in this case occurs inside the critical curve (e.g., Falcke et al. 2000; Narayan et al. 2019). Because GRMHD simulations of hot accretion flows produce geometrically thick accretion disks, one might think that these simulations are better approximated by a spherically symmetric emissivity distribution than an equatorial model. On the contrary, however, even geometrically thick accretion disks in GRMHD simulations are better approximated by the equatorial emission model than a spherically symmetric one. Figure 15 shows time-averaged images from a GRMHD simulation of Sgr Ain the low-magnetic-flux accretion state at several observer inclinations o. At low inclination, the images from this simulation look qualitatively similar to the

The top row shows images in a linear scale, and the bottom row displays images in a gamma scale with  = 1/4. The different panels are each normalized to their own peak brightness, since the total flux density increases with increasing inclination. The critical curve is indicated in cyan, the direct image of the equatorial horizon is indicated by the solid white curve, and the  = 1 image of the equatorial horizon is displayed with the dashed white curve. In this low-magnetic-flux simulation, the 230 GHz emission is concentrated in a geometrially thick disk extending to the horizon. The lensed equatorial horizon image is visible at low inclinations, but is blocked by direct emission from the disk when viewed at edge-on inclinations.

magnetically arrested M87 simulation images in Figure 6; they display both a bright photon ring near the critical curve, and an inner shadow marking the equatorial event horizon. Despite the effects of significant disk thickness, the horizon image is still visible up to moderate inclinations (o  50 deg) in this simulation. At higher inclinations, emission from the disk in front of the black hole blocks the appearance of the horizon inner shadow, and it is not visible.
Some GRMHD simulations produce 230 GHz emission predominantly in the black hole jet or along the "jet sheath" (e.g., The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019e, Figure 4). Because the observed emission in these simulations is not predominantly equatorial, the inner shadow seen in the simulations presented in this paper will not be present in this scenario. Funnel emission in The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. (2019e) is most often seen in simulations with weak magnetic flux, while The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. (2021b) shows that polarimetric EHT observations strongly prefer MAD models with strong magnetic flux for M87. While the MAD models in this paper and in The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. (2019e) show 230 GHz emission that originates predominantly from the equatorial plane, a larger survey over different GRMHD images should be performed to assess how generic this behavior is with respect to different simulation parameters and electron heating/acceleration models.
Even in the Chael et al. (2019) MAD models explored here, in which the 230 GHz emission is predominantly equatorial, nonzero brightness from the forward jet adds a finite

"floor" to the inner shadow (Figure 7). While this emission is dim at 230 GHz and even 86 GHz in these simulations, at even lower frequencies, the forward jet becomes optically thick and eventually obscures the equatorial emission, and hence the inner shadow. Furthermore, the precise size of the observed brightness depression in these models depends on where the foreground emission becomes as bright as emission from the equatorial plane, which falls off rapidly due to the increasing gravitational redshift incurred as the emission radius approaches the horizon. As a result, in these models, the area of the observed brightness depression is larger than the inner shadow of the equatorial emission. By contrast, emission from a thick disk without forward jet emission could produce a central brightness depression with a slightly smaller area than the equatorial inner shadow, as the emission region intersects with the event horizon at a higher latitude above the equatorial plane.
The GRMHD simulation considered in this paper assumes that the plasma angular momentum is aligned with the black hole spin; however, alignment may not be generic in black hole accretion flows. Relatively few "tilted" or misaligned disk GRMHD simulations have been conducted (e.g., Dexter & Fragile 2013; White et al. 2019; Chatterjee et al. 2020). Both White et al. (2019) and Chatterjee et al. (2020) found that in misaligned simulations, new image features can emerge due to shocks and gravitational lensing that change the appearance of the 230 GHz image relative to the images seen from aligned-disk simulations. In particular, tilted simulations can show peak brightness contours that are farther from

B HI
the black hole (and at shifted azimuthal angles) compared to what is typically seen in aligned simulations. Because our definition of the inner shadow in this paper requires equatorial emission, the feature as discussed in this paper would not be visible if the accretion disk feeding the black hole is tilted. However, if the emission extends to the horizon, a similar inner shadow--corresponding to the intersection of the event horizon with an inclined plane--may be present in images from tilted disks. Chatterjee et al. (2020) show timeaveraged simulation images at several observing frequencies from their tilted-disk MAD simulations (their figure 6). In all of these images from Chatterjee et al. (2020), there is a prominent central brightness depression inside the photon ring that most likely marks the event horizon image from emission concentrated in an inclined plane. In a forthcoming work, we will investigate the visibility of the lensed horizon image in tilted disk simulations, and explore the dependence of the shape and size of the horizon image when varying the orientation  of the emission plane.
While we have focused on the Kerr metric, exotic compact objects with horizons will also produce an analogous inner shadow. For instance, Mizuno et al. (2018) present GRMHD simulations of a dilaton black hole, which exhibits a prominent inner shadow (their figure 2). The parametrized nonKerr metrics explored in Medeiros et al. (2020) all have welldefined horizons and so will likely display an inner shadow feature when illuminated by emitting plasma in the equatorial plane. Thus, observing an inner shadow feature from M87 or Sgr Awould not constrain the metric to be Kerr; nevertheless, if the properties of the emission region are well-constrained, then the relationship between the inner shadow and the photon ring can be used as a null hypothesis test of the Kerr metric. For instance, in Kerr, an inner shadow must have diameter 0.45 < ¯h/¯c < 0.7 (see Figure 11). Non-Kerr metrics such as those explored in Medeiros et al. (2020) may show different relationships between the inner shadow and critical curve sizes and shapes that depend on the deviation parameters, enabling these parameters to be constrained in fits to future observations. In addition, horizonless compact objects may also exhibit a feature analogous to the inner shadow if their interior is evacuated (see, e.g., Vincent et al. 2016; Olivares et al. 2020); however, in this case, the properties of the inner shadow will be primarily determined by the structure of the emission region rather than the gravitational lensing of the compact object.
6. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have examined the appearance of the direct image of a Kerr black hole's equatorial event horizon. This lensed feature always lies within the critical curve and is sensitive to the black hole spin and viewing inclination (Takahashi 2004; Dokuchaev & Nazarova 2020b). Using GRMHD and analytic models of the submillimeter emission from M87, we have shown that:
· The direct ( = 0) lensed image of the equatorial event horizon marks the boundary of an "inner shadow" that

S

19

should be observable in future images of M87 if the submillimeter or radio emission is both equatorial and extends to the horizon.
· The radiative GRMHD simulations of M87 from Chael et al. (2019) have emissivity profiles that extend to the horizon and sub-Keplerian flows that result in a relatively weak redshift near the horizon. The "inner shadow" is prominent in images of these simulations.

· Analytic equatorial emission models show some of the main features we see in time-averaged images from these GRMHD simulations, including the photon ring structure and the inner shadow.

· The ngEHT should have the dynamic range necessary to observe the inner shadow in M87, if it is present. This feature could also be visible at other frequencies, even if the optical depth of the accretion disk is high at those frequencies (as it is in the GRMHD simulation we consider at 86 GHz).

· The radius and centroid offset of the direct lensed equatorial horizon image can be used to measure the black hole spin and inclination, and to break degeneracies in estimating both the black hole mass and spin from only one image feature.
· The presence and observability of this feature in M87 is contingent on the emission being predominantly equatorial and extending to the event horizon. If instead the accretion disk is tilted, then there may be an analogous low-brightness feature corresponding to an image of the event horizon's intersection with an inclined plane. Non-Kerr spacetimes may produce an inner shadow with a different size relative to the photon ring than predicted in Kerr, potentially enabling tests of the spacetime using both features.

APPENDIX

A. ANALYTIC RAY TRACING IN KERR
In this Appendix, we review the analytic ray tracing method we use in computing the shape of the lensed horizon image in subsection 2.2 and the emission from the analytic equatorial model used in subsection 3.2. Our method is taken directly from Gralla & Lupsasca (2020a,c), and we only summarize the most important steps here. We restrict our attention to geodesics with positive Carter constant  > 0; the region of "vortical" geodesics with  < 0 is always interior to the lensed equatorial horizon curve and thus within the inner shadow (Gralla & Lupsasca 2020a).
To solve the Kerr null geodesic equation (8), we parameterize the geodesic in terms of the Mino time , such that

The first case of Equation A13 corresponds to light rays appearing outside the critical curve, which encounter a radial turning

point at 4 outside of the event horizon, while the second case corresponds to light rays appearing inside the critical curve, which

terminate

at

horizon.

Combining Equation A6 and Equation A13, we can obtain an expression for max (, ), the maximal number of times a geodesic terminating at the image-plane position (, ) crosses the equatorial plane:

max =

(A14)

Recall that max = 0 inside the direct lensed image of the equatorial horizon; geodesics inside this region do not cross the equatorial plane even once.

B. IMAGE MOMENTS
In this Appendix, we define the second moment used to characterize both the lensed horizon and critical curve in section 4. For a closed convex curve () enclosing the origin in the (, ) coordinate system, the zeroth image moment is the area :

The mean radius and eccentricity are then defined by Equation 21 in the same manner as for an ellipse with semimajor axis  and semiminor axis . That is, the mean radius is ¯ = (2 + 2) /2 and the eccentricity is  = 1 - 2/2.
This definition for the average radius of the critical curve in terms of the image second moment differs from the definition introduced in Johannsen & Psaltis (2010), Equation 4. In Figure 16, we compare the average radii of the critical curve for different black hole spins as a function of inclination angle as determined by these two methods. The second moment method used here for calculating the average radius of the critical curve agrees with the results of the Johannsen & Psaltis (2010) method within one percent for all values of spin and inclination, with the only noticeable discrepancies occurring when both the spin and inclination are large (and the critical curve is at its least-circular).

Figure 16. Comparison of the average radius of the critical curve ¯c computed using the second image moment following the method described in this Appendix (solid lines) with its value computed using the method introduced in Johannsen & Psaltis (2010) (circular markers). The radii are shown as a function of observer inclination o for values of black hole spin  = (0.01, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.99). The two methods produce results that agree to within one percent for all values of black hole spin and observer inclination.
