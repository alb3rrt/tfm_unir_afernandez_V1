## Abstract

We prove Cameron-Martin type quasi-invariance results for the heat kernel measure of infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov and related diffusions. We first study quantitative functional inequalities for appropriate finite-dimensional approximations of these diffusions, and we prove these inequalities hold with dimension-independent coefficients. Applying an approach developed by Baudoin, Driver, Gordina, and Melcher previously, these uniform bounds may then be used to prove that the heat kernel measure for certain of these infinite-dimensional diffusions is quasi-invariant under changes of the initial state.
