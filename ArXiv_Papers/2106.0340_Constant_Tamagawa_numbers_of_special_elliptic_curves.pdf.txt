1. Introduction

The Tamagawa numbers for EA : y2 = x3 - Ax with A  Q× are

TA = #S()(EA)/#S()(E-4A) = 2-tA .

S()(EA) is the -Selmer group of EA,  is the morphism from EA to its 2-isogeny has the following

form.

x2 y(-A - x2)

 : E  E , (x, y)  ( y2 ,

x2

)

In this paper, we mainly concern the -Selmer groups S()(E±) of following elliptic curves:

E = E-2D : y2 = x3 + 2Dx,  = ±1, D = pe11 pe22 · · · penn  Q×, ei = 1, 3.

We show the Tamagawa numbers t-2D in this subgroup are uniform distribution of {0, 1}. Let E = E2D : y2 = x3 - 8Dx denote the 2-isogeny of E, and let E+ = y2 = x3 + 2Dx,
E+ = y2 = x3 - 8Dx and E- = y2 = x3 - 2Dx, E- = y2 = x3 + 8Dx for simplification. Our main
purpose is to prove the following theorems:

Theorem 1.1 (Theorem 3.13). Let E-, E- be the elliptic curves defined above. Then
2-t2D = T2D = #S()(E-)/#S()(E-) = 1/2.
Theorem 1.2 (Theorem 3.15). Let E+, E+ be the elliptic curves defined above. Then
2-t-2D = T-2D = #S()(E+)/#S()(E+) = 1.
Furthermore, we claim that for all D, the parity of dim2 S2(E-) is odd and the parity of dim2 S2(E+) is even. The definition of -Selmer groups can be found in, for example [1]. From the proof of our main theory, we find a method to quickly sieve a part of the elliptic curves with Mordell-Weil rank zero or rank one in this form.
For D which has quite few prime factors, we can enumerate all the possible cases of S()(E±) and S()(E±) to verify the above two theorems. For example, if D = p1p2, we have Table 1 for  = -1, and Table 2 for  = 1, from which, it is easy to obtain our theorems.

According

to

[1],

we

have

S()(E-) = {d  Q(S, 2) : Cd-(Qv) = , v  S}  Q×/Q×2,

S()(E-) = {d  Q(S, 2) : Cd-(Qv) = , v  S}  Q×/Q×2. S()(E+) = {d  Q(S, 2) : Cd+(Qv) = , v  S}  Q×/Q×2,

S()(E+) = {d  Q(S, 2) : Cd+(Qv) = , v  S}  Q×/Q×2,

and we have the following inclusions: {1, 2D}  S()(E-), {1, -2D}  S()(E-) and {1, -2D}  S()(E+), {1, 2D}  S()(E+). Since S()(E±) and S()(E±) have above properties, and are multiplicative abelian groups, when we calculate S()(E±) and S()(E±), we only need to concern ourselves with d  Q2D and Q-2D.

Definition 2.1. Let

· s-() · s-() · s+() · s+()

S()(E-) S()(E-) S()(E+) S()(E+)

Q2D , Q-2D , Q-2D , Q2D .

Apparently, there is a nature map

s-()  S()(E-) - s-() d  d × 2D( mod Q×/Q×2)

and it is easy to check that it is a one-to-one map. Thus we have #S()(E-) = 2#s-(). Similarly, #S()(E+) = 2#s+(), #S()(E±) = 2#s±().
The following lemmas give the method to calculate s±() and s±() by using the Hensel's Lemma. The proof of these lemmas can be found in [3].

Lemma 2.2. Let Cd- be defined as above. Then

(1) Cd-(Q2) =   d  1( mod 8),

Q

and

odd prime satisfying gcd(p, q) = 1, there is no difference between ei = 1 or 3 in Lemmas 2.2 to 2.5.

Thus we assume ei = 1, 1  i  n, or in other words, D is squrefree, in the following part.

3. Proof of the relation

From the Lemmas 2.2 to 2.5, we see that whether an element is in s±() and s±() or not can be determined by the congruence conditions and the Legendre symbol conditions. In this section,
we give the proof of the main theorems. In our proof, we show that the congruence conditions here
can switch to some other Legendre symbol conditions. With the property of Legendre symbol we mentioned in section 2, we will use d instead of d = d mod Q×2 for convenience. Similarly, when we write d1d2 in the following statement, actually we talk about d1d2 = d1  d2 mod Q×2.
For any d  Q2D, let g(d) = (g1(d), g2(d), · · · , gn(d)). Similarly, for any d  Q-2D, let f (d ) = (f1(d ), f2(d ), · · · , fn(d )), where

(3.1)

gi(d) =

(

d pi

)

pi d,

(

2D/d pi

)

pi | d.

fi(d ) =

(

d pi

)

pi d ,

(

-2D/d pi

)

pi | d .

Particularly,

we

have

fi(-1)

(

=

(-1)

,

fi(-D) =

(

2 pi

)

=

(-1)

p2i -1 8

,

and

fi(pj )

=

(

pj pi

).

It

follows that

(3.2)

fi(pj )fj (pi)

=

( pj pi

)( pi pj

)

=

(-1) pi-1 2

pj -1 2

.

Besides, we give the following lemma to show that g and f are group homomorphisms:

Lemma 3.3. For any d1, d2  Q2D, and d1, d2  Q-2D, g(d1)g(d2) = g(d1d2), d1, d2  Q2D,

f (d1)f (d2) = f (d1d2), d1, d2  Q-2D.

Proof. For any d1, d2  Q2D, we only need to verify it in i-th component. Now we divide the proof

into four cases.

(1) For any i such that pi

d1,

d2,

since

(

d2 pi

)

=

1,

it

is

obvious

that

gi(d1)gi(d2)

=

(

d1 pi

)(

d2 pi

)

=

(

d1d2 pi

)

=

gi(d1d2).

(2) For any i such that pi | d1, d2, we have pi d1d2, then

gi(d1)gi(d2)

=

( 2D/d1 )( 2D/d2 )

pi

pi

=

( 4D2/d1d2 ) pi

=

( d1d2

mod pi

Q×2 )

=

gi(d1d2).

(3) For any i such that pi | d1, pi d2, we have pi | d1d2. From case(2) we get

gi(d1)gi(d1d2) = gi(d1d1d2) = gi(d2),

gi(d1d2) = gi2(d1)gi(d1d2) = gi(d1)gi(d2). (4) Similarly, we get the conclusion when pi d1, pi | d2. To summarize,
gi(d1)gi(d2) = gi(d1d2).

Similarly, we have

fi(d1)fi(d2) = fi(d1d2).

In order to simplify the proof, we introduce x(d) and y(d ) here.

Definition 3.4. Define x(d) = (x1(d), x2(d), · · · , xn(d)) and y(d ) = (y1(d ), y2(d ), · · · , yn(d ))  Fn2 , such that gi(d) = (-1)xi(d), fi(d ) = (-1)yi(d ), d  Q2D, d  Q-2D. In other words,

(3.5)

xi(d) =

0 gi(d) = 1, 1 gi(d) = -1.

yi(d ) =

0 fi(d ) = 1, 1 fi(d ) = -1.

Then by Lemma 3.3, we have

xi(d1) + xi(d2) = xi(d1d2), d1, d2  Q2D,
and yi(d1) + yi(d2) = yi(d1d2), d1, d2  Q-2D.
Thus x and y are group homomorphisms as well. By the properties of Legendre symbols and the definition of xi(d1) and yi(d1), the following
proposition is straightforward. For example, the third one is straight forward corollary by 3.2.

Proposition 3.6. We have (1) xi(d) = yi(d), d  Q2D, 1  i  n, such that pi d, (2) xi(d) = yi(d) + yi(-1) = yi(-d), d  Q2D, 1  i  n, such that pi | d, (3) xj(pi) + xi(pj) = yj(pi) + yi(pj) = yi(-1)yj(-1), 1  i = j  n.

Proof. Let ni = #{p | p is a factor of d, p  i( mod 8)}, i = 1, 3, 5, 7. Since 32  52  72  1 mod 8, we can know the congruent number of d module 8 through the result for ni module 2. It's easy to know that

d  1( mod 8)  n3  n5  n7( mod 2), d  3( mod 8)  n5  n7  n3 + 1( mod 2), d  5( mod 8)  n3  n7  n5 + 1( mod 2), d  7( mod 8)  n3  n5  n7 + 1( mod 2).

With the fact that

we can get the result easily.

Theorem 3.8. Let d = pi1 pi2 · · · pik , 1  i1 < i2 · · · < ik  n. Then the condition d  s-() is

equivalent to yij (pm) = 0, 1  m  n + 1.

Proof. From Lemma 2.2 we know
d = pi1 pi2 · · · pik  s-()  d  1( mod 8) and gm(d) = 1, 1  m  n,  d  1( mod 8) and xm(d) = 0, 1  m  n.

From Lemma 3.7, we have d  1 mod 8  (d) = yij (-1) = 0, and yij (D) = 0. If we focus

on the difference between xm(d) and the sum of yij (pm), we have: when m = ij, 1  j  k:

(xm(pij ) + xij (pm)) + ym(-1)

1jn,m=ij

=

(ym(-1)yij (-1)) + ym(-1)

1jn,m=ij

= ym(-1)((d) - ym(-1) + 1).

It follows that

k
xm(d) = yij (pm), 1  m  n  (d) = 0 or ym(-1) = 0, 1  m  n

 (d) = 0,

and (d) = 0 can be deduced from the conditions d  1 mod 8 and yij (d ) = 0, d  Q-2D.

Thus under the condition d  1 mod 8 or yij (pn+1) = 0, we have xm(d) = 0  yij (pm) =

Thus d  s-() is equivalent to yij (pm) = 0, 1  m  n + 1.

Theorem 3.9. For any d  Q-2D, d = pi1 pi2 · · · pik , 1  i1 < i2 < · · · < ik  n + 1, k  1, we have d  s-() if and only if yj(d ) = yj(pi1 ) + yj(pi2 ) + · · · + yj(pik ) = 0 1  j  n.

Proof. From Lemma 2.3, we have

d = pi1 pi2 · · · pik  s-()  d  1( mod 8) or d - 2D/d  1( mod 8) and fm(d ) = 1, 1  m  n,  d  1( mod 8) or d - 2D/d  1( mod 8) and ym(d ) = 0, 1  m  n.

Thus the forward direction is obvious, let us turn to the backward direction. (i) If ik  n, without loss of generality, we may assume d = p1p2 · · · pk. We have

First we prove the forward direction. In fact if  = 1, then by d = d1  1 mod 8, we have

ym() = (d1) = 0. As a result, 0 = ym(d) = xij (pm), 1  m  n. Otherwise, we know

ym(-1), (d1) = 1. Thus 0 = xij (pm) = ym(d), 1  m  n. Since d  1( mod 8) and

ym(d) = 0, 1  m  n, we know d  s+().

Theorem 3.11. For any d  Q2D, d = pi1 pi2 · · · pik , 1  i1 < i2 < · · · < ik  n, k  1, we have d  s+() if and only if xj(d) = xj(pi1 ) + xj(pi2 ) + · · · + xj(pik ) = 0, 1  j  n.
Proof. From Lemma2.3, we have

d = pi1 pi2 · · · pik  s+()  d  1( mod 8) or d + 2D/d  1( mod 8), and gm(d) = 1, 1  m  n,  d  1( mod 8) or d + 2D/d  1( mod 8), and xm(d) = 0, 1  m  n.

Definition 3.12. Let l(1) = 0, and l(d) = max{1  i  n | pi divides d}, for any d  Q-2D, d = 1. Similarly, let l (1) = 0, pn+1 = -1, and l (d) = ik, for d = pi1 pi2 · · · pik  Q-2D, 1  i1 < i2 < · · · < ik  n + 1, k  1.
In the following, we give the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Theorem 3.13. Let E-, E- be the elliptic curves defined above. Then

2-t2D = T2D = #S()(E-)/#S()(E-) = 1/2.

Proof. Let us define a matrix Y = [mi,j](n+1)×n, where mi,j = yj(pi). Since y is a homomorphism, Y encodes the information of {yi(d)}. Let ri, 1  i  n+1 be the row vectors of Y and cj, 1  j  n the column ones as below.

Since y is a homomorphism, to fulfill the condition yi1 (d )+yi2 (d )+· · ·+yik (d ) = 0, d  Q-2D in Theorem 3.8, all we need is yi1 (d ) + yi2 (d ) + · · · + yik (d ) = 0, d = pi, 1  i  n + 1, which is equivalent to the linear dependence condition ci1 + ci2 + · · · + cik = 0.
Similarly, for a fixed d = pi1 pi2 · · · pik = 1, 1  i1 < i2 < · · · < ik  n + 1, from Theorem 3.9, we have
d  s ()  y(d ) = 0

 ri1 + ri2 + · · · + rik = 0 (y is a homomorphism).
Let l(d), l (d ) be as in the Definition 3.12, R = {i > 0 | d  s-(), i = l(d)} and C = {i > 0 | d  s-(), i = l (d )}. As the rank of Y is a certain number for a given Y , we have #C = #R + 1 = n + 1 - rank(Y ). Besides, since for any 0  i  n, either

#{d | d  s-(), l(d)  i + 1} = #{d | d  s-(), l(d)  i}
or #{d | d  s-(), l(d)  i + 1} = 2#{d | d  s-(), l(d)  i},
we have #R = log2(#s-()), and similarly, #C = log2(#s-()). In this way, we have #s-() = 2#s-() immediately. By the fact #S()(E-) = 2#s-() and #S()(E-) = 2#s-(), we have #S()(E-) = 2#S()(E-). It follows that
2-t2D = T2D = #S()(E-)/#S()(E-) = 1/2.

Similarly, we have the proof of Theorem 1.2. Theorem 3.15. Let E+, E+ be the elliptic curves defined above. Then
2-t-2D = T-2D = #S()(E+)/#S()(E+) = 1.

Proof. Let us define Matrix X = [mi,j]n×n, where mi,j = xj(pi), which encodes information of {xi(d)}. Let ri, 1  i  n + 1 be the row vectors of X and cj, 1  j  n be the column vectors.

Similarly, we have the condition d = pi1 pi2 · · · pik  s+() is equivalent to ri1 + ri2 + · · · + rik = 0, And one of d and -d  s+() is equivalent to ci1 + ci2 + · · · + cik = 0.
Let l(d) be as in the Definition 3.12. Define R = {i > 0 | d  s+(), i = l(d)} and C = {i > 0 |
d  s+(), i = l(d )}. Same as the Proof of Theorem 1.1, we have

#R = #C = n - rank(X), #R = log2(#s+()) #C = log2(#s+()).

Similarly, we have #s+() = #s+() immediately. By the fact #S()(E+) = 2#s+() and #S()(E+) = 2#s+(), we have #S()(E+) = #S()(E+). Thus

2-t2D = T2D = #S()(E-)/#S()(E-) = 1.

4. Application
In this section, we give a method to quickly get the Mordell-Weil rank of part of Elliptic Curves in these forms.
In traditional method, determine the structure of -Selmer group needs to traverse Q(S, 2), Which follows exponential computational complexity. In the proof of our main theorem, the problem calculating s±() and s±() are translated into the calculation of linear dependence of rows and columns in matrix X, Y in F2. Moreover, if we want to calculate the sizes of s±() and s±(), we only need to compute the ranks of X and Y . Since by Gaussian elimination, we can determine the rank and the linear dependence relation of matrix with computational complexity O(n3) at most. We can quickly figure out the structure of -Selmer groups of E.
In particular, if rank(X) = n (resp. rank(Y ) = n), we have #s+() = #s+() = 1 (resp. #s-() = 2#s-() = 2). It follows that S()(E+) = S()(E+) = Z/2Z (and resp. S()(E-) = (Z/2Z)2, s()(E+) = Z/2Z.) In addition, from, for example, [1], we get
rE2D + dim(X(E-)[]) + dim(X(E-)[]) = dim(S()(E-)) + dim(S()(E-)) - 2, = dim(s-()) + dim(s-()), = #R + #C ,
= 2n + 1 - 2 rank(Y ).
Similarly,
rE-2D + dim(X(E+)[]) + dim(X(E+)[]) = dim(S()(E+)) + dim(S()(E+)) - 2, = dim(s+()) + dim(s+()), = #R + #C,
= 2n - 2 rank(X).

The dim here means dim2. Therefore, if rank(X) = n, we have rE+2D = 0. Besides, by Birch­Stephens [2], the parity of tA is the same as that of the root number of EA.
(-1)tA = w(EA).

Let LE(s) be the L function associated to E, an elliptic curve over Q of conductor N and

E (s)

=

(2)-sN

s

LE (s).

By Modularity theorem [3], we have E(s) = W (E)E(2 - s), Then by W (E-2D) = -1, we have LE(1) = 0. By Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture [1], we have rE2D  1. Therefore, if rank(Y ) = n, we have rE2D = 1 and XE[] = XE [] = . Hence E-2D(Q) = EtorsZ = Z/2ZZ. Overall, we can quickly sieve some of the elliptic curves in this form which has Mordell-Weil rank
0 or 1.
