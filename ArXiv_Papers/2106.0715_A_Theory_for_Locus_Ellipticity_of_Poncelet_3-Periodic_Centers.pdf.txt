A THEORY FOR LOCUS ELLIPTICITY OF PONCELET 3-PERIODIC CENTERS
MARK HELMAN, DOMINIQUE LAURAIN, DAN REZNIK, AND RONALDO GARCIA
Abstract. We propose a theory which predicts the ellipticity of a triangle center's locus over a Poncelet 3-periodic family. We show that if the triangle center can be expressed as a fixed affine combination of barycenter, circumcenter, and a third, stationary point over some family, then its locus will be an ellipse. Taking billiard 3-periodics as an example, the third point is the mittenpunkt. We derive conditions under which a locus degenerates to a segment or is a circle. We show a locus turning number is either plus or minus 3 and predict its movement monotonicity with respect to vertices of the 3-periodic family. Finally, we derive a (long) expression for the loci of the incenter and excenters over a generic Poncelet 3-periodic family, showing they are roots of a quartic. We conjecture (i) those loci are convex, and (ii) that they can only be ellipses if the pair is confocal, i.e., within a 1d subspace of the 5d space of ellipse pairs which admit 3-periodics.

1. Introduction
This is a continuation of our work [8, 9, 15] analyzing loci of triangle centers over Poncelet 3-periodic families. A recurring question is why under some given family, certain triangle centers sweep elliptic loci and others do not.
Here we finally provide a systematic method to answer the above question. Namely, we show that if a triangle center can be expressed as a fixed affine combination of barycenter, circumcenter, and some other point which remains stationary over a given family, then the locus will be an ellipse.
For the case of the confocal family, said stationary point is the Mittenpunkt, identified in [16]. For this family we also derive conditions under which the locus will be a circle or a segment. We also show a locus' turning number is always ±3 and derive conditions for monotonicity with respect to vertices of a 3-periodic family.
Finally, using a parametrization based on Blaschke's products [5], we show that the locus of the incenter is a quartic over any generic Poncelet 3-periodic family, conjecturing (i) it is always convex, and that (ii) it can only be an ellipse if the pair is confocal. Since the space of possible ellipse configurations admitting Poncelet 3periodics is 5d, our earliest observation ­ that the locus of the incenter over confocal 3-periodics was an ellipse ­ [14] was extremely fortuitous.

Loci of triangle centers over the N = 3 "poristic" family (interscribed between two circles) were studied in [13]. In [18] the loci of vertex, perimeter, and area centroids are studied over a generic Poncelet family indicating that the first and last are always ellipses while in general the perimeter one is not a conic. The locus of the "circumcenter-of-mass" (a generalization of the circumcenter for N-gons), studied in [19], is shown to be a conic over Poncelet N-periodics in [4].
Over confocal 3-periodics, the elliptic locus of (i) the incenter was proved in in [6, 7, 17]; (ii) of the barycenter in [7, 18]; and (iii) of the circumcenter in [6, 7]. The elliptic locus of the Spieker center (which is the perimeter centroid of a triangle) was proved in [7]. Some properties and invariants of confocal N-periodics are described in [16]; N = 3 subcases are proved in [10]. Some invariants have been proved for all N 3 in [2, 3, 4].

2. Preliminaries Referring to Figure 3, we depart from the following fact, proved in [11].

Theorem 1. Over the family of 3-periodics interscribed in a generic nested pair of ellipses (non-concentric, non-axis-aligned), if X, is a fixed linear combination of X2 and X3, i.e., X, = X2 + X3 for some fixed ,   C, then its locus is an ellipse.

Consider the affine image of 3-periodics in a generic pair of ellipses such that the

external ellipse is sent to the unit circle, Figure 1. Let f, g be the foci of the caustic

thus obtained.

Let p = (a + b)/2 and q = (a - b)/2. If, as in Theorem 1, X, = X2 + X3 for

some

fixed

, 



C,

then

the

latter

can

be

parametrized

as

X,

=

u

v

where [11, Eqn. 3]:

q f + g p2( + 3) - q2 + p(f + g) p2 - q2( + 3)

w :=

3(p - q)(p + q)

This parametrization comes from seeing the 3-periodics as the result of a fixed affine transformation applied to the solutions of B(z) =  for each  in the unit circle of C, where B( · ) is a degree-3 Blaschke product.

Remark 1. In [5, Lemma 3.4, p. 28] it is shown that (i) the complex argument of the Blaschke product is monotonic on the unit circle, and that (ii) for each  there are 3 solutions for the equation B(z) = . This means that as  sweeps the unit circle monotonically, the 3-periodics sweep the outer Poncelet ellipse monotonically and in the same direction as . Moreover for every 3 full cycles of  over the complex the unit circle, each vertex of the 3-periodics sweep the outer ellipse exactly once.

Lemma 1. If u, v, w  C and  is a parameter that varies over the unit circle

T  C, then the curve parametrized by

F

()

=

+

+

w

is an ellipse centered at w, with semiaxis |u| + |v| and |u| - |v| , rotated with respect

to the canonical axis of C by an angle of (arg u + arg v)/2.

Definition 1 (Degenerate Locus). When the elliptic locus of a triangle center is a segment, i.e., one of its axes has shrunk to zero, we will call it "degenerate".

3. Elliptic Loci in the Confocal Pair
The confocal ellipse pair whose outer ellipse has axes a, b and admits a 3-periodic family. The caustic semi-axes are given by [7]:

a  - b2

b a2 - 

ac = 

c2

, bc =

c2 ·

where c2 = a2 - b2 and  = a4 - a2b2 + b4.

The affine transformation x  x/a, y  y/b sends the confocal pair to a pair

where the outer conic is the unit circle and the caustic Ec is a concentric ellipse. The foci f, g of the Ec are given by:

where

c

=

 (1/c) 2

f= b2.

(-c,

g = (c, 0)

Corollary 1. If a triangle center Xk is stationary over a Poncelet 3-periodic family, then the locus of any triangle center X which is a fixed linear combination of X2, X3, Xk will be an ellipse.

Proof. The triangle center X = X2 + X3 + Xk is the linear combination X, := X2 + X3 under a fixed translation by Xk, because both Xk and Xk are fixed over the family.

We are now in a position to offer a compact alternate proof to the ellipticity of X1 previously done in [7, 17]:
Corollary 2. In the confocal pair, the locus of X1 is an ellipse.
Proof. For any triangle, X1 can be expressed as the linear combination X1 = X2 + X3 + X9 of X2, X3 and X9 with:



=

2

,



=



2 +

2

,



=

- - 4 +2

where  = r/R, is the ratio of inradius to circumradius. Since in the confocal family

X9 is stationary and  is invariant [16], the claim follows.

We are now in a position to expand this last result to many other triangle centers in the confocal pair (elliptic billiard), as many of these are fixed linear combinations of X2, X3, and X9. In order to do so, we compute several of such linear combinations in Table 2 of Appendix A, most of which were derived from the "combos" in [12]. We use the existence of these linear combinations to prove the following very comprehensive result:

Corollary 3. In the confocal pair, from X1 to X200, the loci of Xk are ellipses, k =1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 20, 21, 35, 36, 40, 46, 55, 56, 57, 63, 65, 72, 78, 79, 80, 88, 84, 90, 100, 104, 119, 140, 142, 144, 145, 149, 153, 162, 165, 190,
191, 200.

Proof. As in the previous corollary, one can write X1 as a fixed linear combination of X2, X3, and X9, given that the ratio  = r/R is constant in the confocal pair. Using the formulas from Table 2 in Appendix A, all these triangle centers
(except for X88, X162, and X190) are fixed linear combinations of X1, X2, and X3, and therefore they are fixed linear combinations of X2, X3, and X9 as well. By Corollary 1, given that X9 is stationary over the confocal family, this implies the loci of all these triangle centers are ellipses.

Note: the loci of X88, X162, and X190 are also ellipses because by definition they lie on the circumconic centered on X9 [12, X(9)]. Centers railed to said circumconic were called "swans" in [15], as over the confocal family they execute an intricate dance, which can be seen live here.
Referring to Figure 2:

Proposition 1. In the confocal pair, the locus of X = X2 + X3 for ,   R is degenerate when:

 

=

2a2

- b2 2b2

+,

or

 

=

2b2

- a2 2a2

+



Proof. By Lemma 1, this will happen when |u| = |v| in Theorem 1. In the confocal pair, when ,   R, both u and v are real numbers as well. Thus, the ratios / that yield degenerate loci can be computed directly by solving u = ±v.

Observation 1. These ratios / that make the locus of X be degenerate can also

be expressed in terms of  = r/R as:

Proposition 2. In the confocal pair, the locus of X = X2 + X3 for ,   R is a circle when:

 

 - 3ab ± 2 a2 + b2

=
±

2ab

Proof. By Lemma 1, this will happen when |u| + |v| = |u| - |v| with u, v from Theorem 1. In the confocal pair, when ,   R, both u and v are real numbers as well. Thus, this condition holds if and only if either u = 0 or v = 0. The ratios / that yield circular loci can then be computed directly.

Observation 2. It follows that (/)+ + (/)- = -3.

Proposition 3. Let X be a fixed linear combination of X2, X3, and Xk, where Xk is some stationary center over the family of 3-periodics. As the vertices of the 3-periodics sweep the outer ellipse monotonically, the path of X in its elliptical locus
is monotonic as well, except for when this locus is degenerate.

Proof.

By

Theorem 1,

the

locus

of

X

can

be

parametrized

by

u

v

1 

+w

for

some u, v, w  C, where  sweeps the unit circle in C in the same direction as the

3-periodic vertices sweep the outer ellipse of the Poncelet pair (see Remark 1). We

can thus parametrize X as X (t) = ueit + ve-it + w. If either u = 0 or v = 0, it is

clear from this parametrization that X sweeps its locus monotonically. Thus, we

can now assume that u = 0 and v = 0.

Denoting u = u0 + iu1 and v = v0 + iv1 with u0, u1, v0, v1  R, we can directly

compute

Since (u2v1 - u1v2)2 + (u1v1 + u2v2)2 = (u21 + u22)(v12 + v22) = |u|2|v|2, there is some angle   [0, 2) (the angle between the vectors (u1, u2) and (v1, v2)) such
that u1v1 + u2v2 = |u||v| cos  and u2v1 - u1v2 = |u||v| sin . Substituting this back
in the previous equation, we derive

never vanishes, meaning that the X sweeps its smooth locus monotonically. By

Lemma 1, this means that X sweeps its locus monotonically except when this locus

is degenerate.

Proposition 4. Let X be a fixed linear combination of X2, X3, and Xk, where Xk is some stationary center over the family of 3-periodics. Over a full cycle of 3-periodics, the winding number of X over its elliptical locus is ±3, except for when
this locus is degenerate.

Proof.

By Theorem

1, the locus of

X

can

be

parametrized

by

u

+

w

for some

u, v, w  C. From Remark 1, one can see that the winding number of  associated

to 3-periodics is +3 for each full cycle of 3-periodics over the outer Poncelet ellipse.

Thus, it is sufficient to prove that the winding number of X over its elliptical locus

is ±1 as  goes around the complex unit circle just once.

Since w is the center of the elliptic locus of X (see Lemma 1), we compute the

winding number of X around w. Parametrizing X as X (t) = ueit + ve-it + w where

 = eit, one can directly compute the winding number as [1, Lemma 1, p. 114]:

X

=

1 2i

-

|v|2)

By Lemma 1, the only way we can have |u| = |v| is if the locus of X is degenerate.

Thus, whenever this locus is not degenerate, the winding number of X around its

locus as  sweeps the unit circle once is equal to 1 if |u| > |v| and -1 when |u| < |v|,

as desired.

Note: X1, a point over the incircle family, can be regarded as a degenerate ellipse.

Those of X2 and X4 are axis-aligned with the outer ellipse. Furthermore, the centers of all elliptic loci are collinear (magenta line). Video
5. The locus of the Incenter in a Generic Pair
In the homothetic pair, the locus pf X1 is a quartic defined implicitly by:
X1 : 16 a2b2x4 + 16(a4 + b4)x2y2 - 8 b2(a4 + 5 a2b2 + 2 b4)x2 + 16 a2b2y4 - 8 a2(2 a4 + 5 a2b2 + b4)y2 + a2b2(a2 - b2)2 = 0
Consider the parametrization of a triangular orbit {z1, z2, z3} as given in [11]. Let T (z) denote the affine transformation T (z) = pz + qz. Let  denote a point on the complex unit circle.

where f, g are the foci of the inner ellipse and   T is the varying parameter.

Proposition 5. Over Poncelet 3-periodics in the pair with an outer unit circle and an ellipse in generic position, the locus X1 given by:
X1 : z4 - 2((f¯ + g¯) + f g)z2 + 8z + (f¯ - g¯)22 + 2(|f |2g + f |g|2 - 2f - 2g) + f 2g2 = 0
also: X1 : z4 - 22z2 + 8z + (22 - 41) = 0

Proof. The incenter of a triangle with vertices {z1, z2, z3} is given by: X1 = s1 z1s1++s2s2z2++s3s3 z3 s1 = |z2 - z3|2, s2 = |z1 - z3|2, s3 = |z2 - z1|2

Using that zi  T it follows that

, s3 = 2 -

z1 z2

+

z2 z1

Eliminating the square roots in the equation X1 - z = 0 and using the relations i (i=1,2,3) given in Blaschke's parametrization the result follows.

Corollary 5. If f =g, the locus of X1 is a quartic which can never degenerate to an ellipse.
Recall p = (a + b)/2 and q = (a - b)/2. Remark 2. For zi  T1 we have that X1 : -z1z2 - z1z3 - z2z3.
Proposition 6. Over Poncelet 3-periodics in a generic nested ellipse pair, the locus of X1 and the excenters is given by the roots of the following quartic polynomial in z:

X1 : (p - q)2(p + q)22z4 - 4  pq((2 + )p2 - (2   + 2)pq + (2 + )q2)z3 + (-2  2p4 + 2  (2  2 +   + 9 )qp3 + (-4 22 - 8  2 - 20   + 4 2)q2p2 + 2  (2  2 +   + 9 )pq3 - 2  2q4)z2 + (8 3p4 - 4  ( 2 + 6   - 2)p3q + (4   2 + 16 2 - 4 2 + 20 3 - 4  )q2p2 - 4  ( 2 + 6   - 2)pq3 + 8 3q4)X - 2(4   - 2)p4 + 2  (4 2 - 2 + 2 3 -  )qp3 + (-4 3 + 22 - 12  3 + 2 22 + 2    + 2)q2p2 + 2  (4 2 - 2 + 2 3 -  )q3p - 2(4   - 2)q4

Proof. Consider the affine transformation T (z) = pz + qz and set wi = T (zi). The
proof is similar to that given in Proposition 5. In order to simplify the vertices zi in the implicit equation it is necessary to evaluate the sums pk = z1k + z2k + z3k (k = 1, . . . , 5), expressing the result in terms of ,  and . For convenience, they

Proposition 7. In the confocal pair the locus X1 is defined by:

-a4 + b4 + c2  -a2 - b2  + c4 + 2 a2b2

X1 = z -

Proof. In the confocal pair we have that

This is obtained by taking an affine map T (z) = (a + b)z/2 + (a - b)z¯/2) sending the pair with an unitary outer circle to the confocal pair.
The result follows by factorization of the quartic polynomial that defines X1 in Proposition 6.
Using CAS we obtain that X1 is factorizable as E1E2, where

E1 = z -

-a4 + b4 + c2 2 a2b2

-a2 - b2  + c4 + 2 a2b2 2 a2b2

Referring to Figures 4 and 5:

Conjecture 1. The locus of X1 is always convex. If the pair is concentric at O, the locus diameter passes through O and the locus is four-fold symmetric about O. If the pair is non-concentric, the diameter does not pass through either ellipse center and the locus is asymmetric about the center of its diameter).

The following remark comes from [11, Lemma 1].

Remark 3. If u, v, w  C and  is a parameter that varies over the unit circle T  C, then the curve parametrized by

is an ellipse centered at w, with semiaxis |u|+|v| and |u|-|v| , rotated with respect to the canonical axis of C by an angle of (arg u + arg v)/2.

Conjecture 2. Over Poncelet 3-periodics in some ellipse pair, the locus of the incenter X1 and excenters P1, P2, P3 are ellipses if and only if the pair is confocal.

Table 2. Triples , ,  used to express a given triangle center Xk as the linear combinations X1 + X2 + X3. Note:  = r/R. Note also that though the loci of X88, X162 , and X190 are ellipses (in fact, they sweep the elliptic billiard), they are not included since they are not fixed linear combinations, see text. Notice ,, are the same up to sign of  for harmonic conjugate pairs (X11,X12), (X35,X36), (X55,X56).
