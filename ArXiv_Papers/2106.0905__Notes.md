## Abstract

The paper presents an analysis of the latest developments in the field of stereo vision in the low-cost segment, both for prototypes and for industrial designs. We described the theory of stereo vision and presented information about cameras and data transfer protocols and their compatibility with various devices. The theory in the field of image processing for stereo vision processes is considered and the calibration process is described in detail. Ultimately, we presented the developed stereo vision system and provided the main points that need to be considered when developing such systems. The final, we presented software for adjusting stereo vision parameters in real-time in the python language in the Windows operating system.
