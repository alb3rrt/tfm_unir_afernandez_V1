1 Introduction
A geometric graph G is a graph whose vertex set is a set of points P in the plane, and where the weight of an edge uv is equal to the Euclidean distance |uv| between u and v. Informally, a k-graph is a geometric graph built by dividing the area around each point of v  P into k equal angled cones, connecting v to the closest neighbor in each cone (we shall define closest later). Such graphs arise naturally in settings like wireless networks, where signals to anyone but your nearest neighbor may be drowned out by interference. Moreover, the fact that signal strength fades quadratically with distance, and thus that power requirements are proportional to the square of the distance the signal has to travel, makes many small hops economically superior to one large hop, even if the sum of the distances is larger. The spanning ratio (sometimes called the stretch factor ) of a geometric graph G is the maximum over all pairs u, v  P of the ratio between the length of the shortest path from u to v in G and the Euclidean distance from u to v. Using simple geometric observations and techniques, we give a new analysis of the spanning ratio of 5-graphs, bringing down the best known upper bound from 9.96 [5] to 5.70.
Theorem 1. Given a set P of points in the plane, the 5-graph of P is a 5.70-spanner.

k-graphs were introduced simultaneously by Keil and Gutwin [8, 9], and Clarkson [7]. Both papers gave a spanning ratio of 1/(cos  - sin ), where  = 2/k is the angle defined by the cones. Observe that this gives a constant spanning ratio for k  9. When this ratio t is constant, we call the graph a t-spanner. Ruppert and Seidel [11] improved this to 1/(1 - 2 sin(/2)), which applies to k-graphs with k  7. Chew [6] gave a tight bound of 2 for k = 6. Bose, De Carufel, Morin, van Renssen, and Verdonschot [4] give the current best bounds on the spanning ratio of a large range of values of k. For k = 5, Bose, Morin, van Renssen, and Verdonschot [5] showed an upper bound of 9.96, and a lower bound of 3.78. For k = 4, Bose, De Carufel, Hill, and Smid [3] showed a spanning ratio of 17, while Barba, Bose, De Carufel, van Renssen, and Verdonschot [2] gave a lower bound of 7 on the spanning ratio. For k = 3, although Aichholzer, Bae, Barba, Bose, Korman, van Renssen, Taslakian, and Verdonschot [1] showed 3 to be connected, El Molla [10] showed that there is no constant t for which 3 is a t-spanner.
In this paper we study the spanning ratio of 5. We consider two arbitrary vertices, a and b, and show that there must exist a short path between them using induction on the rank of the Euclidean distance |ab| among all distances between pairs of points in P . Our main result states that for all a, b  P the shortest path P(a, b) has length |P(a, b)|  K · |ab|, where K = 5.70.
Much of the difficulty in bounding the spanning ratio of the 5-graph stems from the following.
1. The regular pentagon is not centrally symmetric.
2. Give two vertices a and b, it may be the case that every vertex v adjacent to a has the property that |vb| > |ab|. In other words, all the neighbours of a are farther from b than a itself.
We organize the rest of the paper as follows. In Section 2 we introduce concepts and notation, and give some assumptions about the positions of a and

b that do not reduce the generality of our arguments. In Section 3 we solve all but a handful of cases using general arguments that simplify the analysis. The remaining cases are solved using ad-hoc methods, showing a spanning ratio of K = 6.16. In Section 4 we observe that only a single case requires K  6.16. We analyze this case in detail to show that |P(a, b)|  K · |ab| for all K  5.70. In Section 5 we discuss directions for future work.

2 Preliminaries
Let k  3 be an integer. Let P be set of points in the plane in general position, that is, all distances (as defined below) between pairs of points are unique and no two points have the same x-coordinate or y-coordinate. Construct the k-graph of P as follows. The vertex set is P . For each i with 0  i < k, let Ri be the ray emanating from the origin that makes an angle of 2i/k with the negative y-axis. All indices are manipulated mod k, i.e., Rk = R0. For each vertex v we add at most k outgoing edges as follows: For each i with 0  i < k, let Rvi be the ray emanating from v parallel to Ri. Let Civ be the cone consisting of all points in the plane that are strictly between the rays Rvi and Rvi+1 or on Rvi+1. If Civ contains at least one point of P \ {v}, then let wi be the closest such point to v, where we define the closest point to be the point whose perpendicular projection onto the bisector of Civ minimizes the Euclidean distance to v. We add the directed edge vwi to the graph. While the use of directed edges better illustrates this construction, in what follows we regard all edges of a 5-graph as undirected. See Fig. 1 for an example of cones and construction.
For the following description, refer to Fig. 2. Consider two vertices a and b of P . Given the 5-graph of P , we define the canonical triangle Tab to be the triangle bounded by the sides of the cone of a that contains b and the line through b perpendicular to the bisector of that cone. Note that for every pair
Angle values are given counter-clockwise unless otherwise stated.

of vertices a and b there are two corresponding canonical triangles, namely Tab and Tba. Without loss of generality assume that b is in C2a. Let be the leftmost
vertex of the triangle Tab and let r be the rightmost vertex of the triangle Tab. Let m be the midpoint of r. Note that a must be in C4b or C0b; since the cases
are symmetric in what follows, without loss of generality we consider the case

where a is in C4b. Thus b is to the right of m. Let rm be the intersection of r and the bisector of ram, and let m be the intersection of r and the bisector of ma . Let and r be the left and right endpoints of Tba respectively (as

seen from b facing a). Let m be the midpoint of r , and let m and rm be the intersections of r and the bisector of  bm and m br respectively. See

Figure 2a. Let  = bam and let  = abm . Note that  +  = /5 since 

and

are alternate interior angles.

Thus either   /10 or 

 /10.

Without loss of generality, we assume   /10. Let c be the closest neighbor

to a in C2a, and let d be the closest neighbor to b in C4b. See Figure 2b. For simplicity, we write "5" to mean "the 5-graph of P ".

To sum up our assumptions following this discussion: Without loss of gen-

erality we assume that b is in C2a, a is in C4b, c is the nearest neighbour of a in C2a and d is the nearest neighbour of b in C4b. In addition, we refer back to this assumption, recalling that  is the clockwise angle ab makes with the vertical

axis.

Observation 1. Let  be clockwise angle ab makes with the vertical axis. Then 0    /10.

We proceed by induction to bound the spanning ratio of 5. We show that, for any pair of points a, b  P , the length of a shortest path |P(a, b)| in 5 is at most K times the Euclidean distance between its endpoints. The induction is on the rank of the Euclidean distance |ab| among all distances between pairs of points in P . The exact bound on K is made explicit in the proof. Lemma 2 is sufficient for the base case of the induction, but we first require the following geometric lemma:

Lemma 1. Let T be a triangle pqr, and without loss of generality assume that |pq|  |pr|. Then for all points s  T , |ps|  |pr|.

Proof. (Figure 3a) Let s be the intersection of the line through ps onto qr, thus |ps|  |ps | and it is enough to show that |ps |  |pr|. The distance from p to s is a convex function of the angle (spq). The minimum of this function is attained when the lines through ps and qr are orthogonal. Therefore the maximum is attained either at s = q or s = r, whichever is furthest.

Lemma 2. Let (a0, b0) be the pair of points in P that minimizes |ab| over all points a and b in P . The 5-graph of P contains the edge a0b0.
In what follows we use abc to denote the triangle defined by the points a, b, and c (given counter-clockwise). We use abc to denote the amplitude of the angle at b in that triangle.

(b) The triangles Tab and Tarb.

Proof. (See Figure 3b.) Assume by contradiction that 5 does not contain ab, then some point p  P different from a or b is contained in Tab. We show that |bp| < |ab|, hence ab is not the closest pair in P .
Divide Tab into two triangles by separating Tab along ab into the left triangle Tab and the right triangle Tarb. Then p belongs to one of these triangles. Observation 1 gives us that 0    /10, and thus |ba|  |b |  |br| and in both cases we can apply Lemma 1.
If ab  5, then |P(a, b)|  K|ab| holds for all K  1. Otherwise we assume the following induction hypothesis: for every pair of points a , b  P where |a b | < |ab|, the shortest path P(a , b ) from a to b has length at most |P(a , b )|  K · |a b |, for some K  1. Our goal is to find the minimum value of K for which our inductive argument holds.
Recall that c is the closest point to a in C2a and d is the closest point to b in C4b. We restrict our analysis to the following three paths:
(1) ac + P(c, b),
(2) bd + P(d, a), and
(3) ac + P(c, d) + db.
Depending on the particular arrangement of a, b, c, and d, we examine a subset of these and find a minimum value for K that satisfies at least one of the following inequalities:
(A) |ac| + K · |cb|  K · |ab|,
(B) |bd| + K · |da|  K · |ab|, and
(C) |ac| + K · |cd| + |db|  K · |ab|.
Observe that our inductive argument follows if any of these cases holds. For instance, if we prove (A) holds for some value K, it implies that |cb| < |ab| (since all distances are positive), and thus |P(c, b)|  K · |cb| by the induction hypothesis. Similar conclusions follow for statements (B) and (C). Thus we can combine (1)-(3) with (A)-(C) as follows.

For any given arrangement of vertices we prove that at least one of (A), (B), or (C) holds true for some value K, and find the smallest value for which this is true. Our proof relies mainly on case analysis, but some of these cases have similar structure. We exploit this structure in Section 3 by designing two geometric lemmas that we apply repeatedly in the inductive step. These lemmas, along with additional arguments, are then applied to different arrangements of a, b, c, and d. For all but one case we show that at least one of (a), (b), or (c) holds true for K  5.70. The last case requires K  6.16. We improve this further to K  5.70, but due to the complexity of this last case, we dedicate Section 4 to its analysis.

3 Analysis

We first introduce two triangles T3 and T4 for which inequalities of the form of (A) and (B) hold for reasonable values of K (see Figure 4). Note the triangles are numbered to correspond to the lemmas they appear in. We state these inequalities as lemmas whose repeated use simplifies the proof of our main result.

Let wr be the horizontal projection of w onto st, and let w be the horizontal projection of w onto su. We have |wwr| + |wrt|  |wt|

 = |sw| + K|wt| - K|st|  |sw | + K(|wwr| + |wrt|) - K(|swr| + |wrt|)  |sw | + K|w wr| - K|swr| =  .

Let  = vst  0. Observe that  increases as  decreases, since |swr| de-

creases while |w wr| increases and |sw | stays constant. Hence,  is maximized

when  = 0, that is, when wr lies on sv. Thus assume that wr lies on sv and

let |sw | = 1 without loss of generality. We bound

Let wr be the horizontal projection of w onto st, and let w be the horizontal

We also have that sww > /2, which implies that sw is the longest edge in

sww (the triangle can be drawn inside a disk whose diameter is sw ), and

thus |sw |  |sw|. Since w is on w wr, we have |w wr|  |wwr|. Thus

 = |sw| + K|wt| - K|st|  |sw | + K(|wwr| + |wrt|) - K(|swr| + |wrt|)  |sw | + K|w wr| - K|swr| =  .

As in the definition of Tab and Tba in Section 2, let c be the point closest to a in Tab and let d be the point closest to b in Tba. We proceed by case analysis depending on the location of the points c and d.
If c is to the right of ab or if d is to the right of ab, we can apply Lemma 3 to show the existence of a short path from a to b. When both c and d are left of ab, we use a more complicated argument requiring a new definition:
Definition 1. (Figure 7) Given any pair of points (a, b) in P , let r and rm be as in the definition of Tba in Section 2. We define Pab to be the regular pentagon with vertices (p0, p1, p2 = r , p3 = rm, p4) where p4 is above the line going through r and rm (this uniquely defines the remaining points p0 and p1).
Observe that Pab is fixed with respect to Tba. This construction puts p4 inside Tab and puts p0 and p1 on a horizontal line with b, with p0 lying on the boundary of Tab.

9

Claim 5. Given Definition 1 we have that p4  Tab, p0  b, and p1 lies on the line through and b.

Proof. Note that p3p4 and p3b share the same supporting line since p2p3p4 =

p2p3b =

3 5

.

Let f

be

the intersection

of

a

and p3b. Given this observation

and this definition, it is equivalent to prove that p4 lies in the segment f b.

Translate a on the segment m . Since the slope of a is smaller than the slope of m , translating a to a = , that is letting  = 0, maximizes the y-intercept of the line going through a and with any fixed vertical line. Hence

this translation shrinks f b, and it remains to prove that p4 stays in f b only in

that extreme case.

With the simplifying assumption that  = 0, we show that |p3f | < |p3p4| <

|p3b|, which proves the claim. Note that  ap3 = /10 and p3f a = /2, thus

|p3f |

=

|p3a| sin(/10).

both c and d are in Pab we analyze the length

of the path ac + P(c, d) + db. Lemma 14 gives

Tba

us a bound of 6.16|ab| with a simple proof.

Using a more technical analysis, we obtain a

bound of 5.70|ab|. This is proven in Lemma 18

Figure 8: Transformation 1. in Section 4. Some of the proofs use the simplifying as-

sumption that  = /10. This is achieved

through the following transformation: given a, b, c, d  P with Tab and Tba as

defined earlier, we define:

Transformation 1. Fix b, c, d, and Tba, and translate a along r until a = m.

See Fig. 8. Observe that this transformation changes |ac| and |ab|, but not |bd|, |cd|, or |cb|. The transformation also changes |ad|, but we do not use it in any case that depends on this value. We prove the following lemma allowing the application of Transformation 1 without loss of generality in several cases.

Lemma 6. Under Transformation 1, the values of |bd|, |cd|, and |cb| are unchanged, and  = |ac| - K|ab| is maximized when a = m for all K  3.24.

Figure 9: The values used in the proof of Lemma 6.

By Lemma 6 we see that by applying Transformation 1 we maximize the value |ac| - K|ab|. Another way to see this is that we minimize K|ab|. This, in turn, allows us to explicitly determine under what conditions the inductive hypothesis applies. Note that applying Transformation 1 to where a = m is equivalent to assuming  = /10.
All these proofs can be combined in an analysis comprising eight cases depending on the location of c and d with respect to Tab, Tba, and Pab, as illustrated below in the breakdown of the case analysis below. In each case we prove that for a given arrangement of vertices that |P(a, b)|  K|ab| for the given value K.

Lemma 7. If c is right of ab, then |P(a, b)|  K|ab| for K  4.53.
Proof. (Figures 4, 10) Let (s, t, w, u, v) = (a, b, c, r, m), thus these points correspond to triangle T3 of Lemma 3. Thus |ac| + K|cb|  K|ab| for all K  4.53. The induction hypothesis and Lemma 3 imply that there is a path from a to b with length at most
|P(a, b)|  |ac| + |P(c, b)|  |ac| + K|cb|  K|ab|.

Lemma 8. If d is right of ab, then |P(a, b)|  K|ab| for K  4.53.
Proof. (Figures 4, 11) Let (s, t, w, u, v) = (b, a, d, m , ), thus these points correspond to triangle T3 from Lemma 3. Thus |bd| + K|da|  K|ab| for K  4.53 by Lemma 3. The induction hypothesis and Lemma 3 imply that there is a path from a to b with length at most
|P(a, b)|  |bd| + |P(d, a)|  |bd| + K|da|  K|ab|.

Lemma 9. If c is left of ab and in TabTba, then |P(a, b)|  K|ab| for K  5.70.
Proof. (Figures 4, 12) Let p be the intersection of br and a , and let q be the intersection of the lines through r b and arm. Observe that 0  rmab  /10, thus rmab has the same range as vst from T4 in Lemma 4. If we let points (s, t, w, u, v) = (a, b, c, p, q), then these points correspond to the triangle T4, and

thus |ac| + K|cb|  K|ab| for K  5.70 by Lemma 4. Our induction hypothesis and Lemma 4 imply that there is a path from a to b with length
|P(a, b)|  |ac| + |P(c, b)|  |ac| + K|cb|  K|ab|.

Lemma 10. If c  Tab \ (Tba  Pab), then |P(a, b)|  K|ab| for all K  4.53.
Proof. (Figures 4, 7b) Let  = |ac| + K|cb| - K|ab|. We apply Transformation 1. Since c  Tba it must be left of mb, thus c remains left of ab. As a moves left along m, so does the left side of Tab, which means that c remains inside Tab. Thus Lemma 6 implies that  is maximized at  = /10, thus we assume this is the case. Observe that ba m = /5, and  mba = 2/5 < /2. Let q be the intersection of the line through b orthogonal to ab and the line through a and m. If we let (s, t, w, u, v) = (a, b, c, q, b) then these points correspond to T3. Then Lemma 3 tells us that |ac|+K|cb|  K|ab| and thus  = |ac|+K|cb|-K|ab|  0 for all K  4.53.

Lemma 11. If d is left of ab and right of am, then |P(a, b)|  K|ab| for K  3.24.

Proof. (Figure 14) We show  = |bd| + K|da| - K|ab|  0, which implies

|P(a, b)|  |bd| + |P(d, a)|  K|ab| by the triangle inequality and the induction

hypothesis.

Let d be the horizontal projection of d onto ab. Let 1 = |bd| - K|bd | and

2 = K|da| - K|d a|, and note that  = 1 + 2 since d  ab. Thus it is

sufficient to show that 1  0 and 2  0.

Observe that d da > /2, since d is right of am, thus |d a| > |da|, and

2  0 for all K  1.

For 1  0 we need K

Let  = d db and

Lemma 12. If c is in Pab \ Tba, and d is left of am but above c, then |P(a, b)|  K|ab| for all K  4.53.
Proof. (Figures 4, 16) We show  = |ac|+K|cd|+|db|-K|ab|  0, which implies |P(a, b)|  |ac| + |P(c, d)| + |db|  K|ab| by the triangle inequality and the induction hypothesis. We split  into two parts, and show that each part is less than 0. Let d be the horizontal projection of d onto ab. Let 1 = |bd| - K|bd |, and let 2 = |ac| + K|cd| - K|ad |. Observe that  = 1 + 2 since d  ab.
To show that 1  0, observe that dy(b, d) = dy(b, d )  |bd |. Thus let 1 = |bd| - K · dy(b, d)  1. Let  = d db, and observe that 1 = |bd|(1 - K sin ). Note that   /10 since d  Tba, and thus K  3.24 is sufficient to have 1  0.
For 2  0, let d be the horizontal projection of d onto am. Since ad d = /2, |ad |  |ad |. Since c  Tba, cdd  9/10, thus |cd | > |cd|. Let 2 = |ac| + K|cd | - K|ad |  2. Let q be the horizontal projection of d onto a . Let the points (s, t, w, u, v) = (a, d , c, q, d ) and thus these points correspond to T3. Thus |ac|+K|cd |  K|ad | for all K  4.53 by Lemma 3.
Lemma 13. If d is left of ab, below c and not in Pab, then |P(a, b)|  K|ab| for all K  5.70.
Proof. (Figures 4, 13) We note that ac and bd intersect and d must be outside of Tab (otherwise ad would be and edge of 5, but not ac). We first show that d is below brm. Recall that Pab is fixed with respect to Tba. Since d is outside of Tab and Pab, if p4p0 is inside Tab, d must be below brm. Since the slope of p0p4 is less than the slope of a, it is sufficient to show that p4 is inside Tab which follows by Claim 5. By Observation 1 we have that 0  ab  /10. Thus we can map the points (s, t, w, u, v) to (b, a, d, rm, ) and apply Lemma 4. Thus |bd| + K|da|  K|ab| for K  5.70. Our induction hypothesis and Lemma 4 imply that there is a path from b to a with length at most
|P(a, b)|  |bd| + |P(d, a)|  |bd| + K|da|  K|ab|.

Lemma 14. If ac and bd cross and both c and d are in Pab, then |P(a, b)|  K|ab| for K  6.16.

Proof. (Figures 4, 15) We show  = |ac| + K|cd| + |db| - K|ab|  0, which

implies |P(a, b)|  |ac| + |P(c, d)| + |db|  K|ab| by the triangle inequality and

the induction hypothesis. Under Transformation 1, Lemma 6 implies that  is

maximized when  = /10, so we assume this is the case. Since c, d, and Pab

are fixed, c and d are still inside Pab after Transformation 1. Given that c and

d are in Pab, the furthest apart c and d can be is if they are both on a diagonal

of Pab.

The length of one side of Pab

4 Proving a spanning ratio of 5.70

In this section we present a lemma with a stronger bound for the case handled

by Lemma 14. Proving this lemma requires a careful analysis of the locations

of c and d and the tradeoffs between the values of |ac| + |db| and K|cd|. Let

 = |ac| + K|cd| + |db| - K|ab|. For the rest of this section, assume we have

applied Transformation 1, and thus  = /10 and  is maximized. Since Pab,

c and d are fixed, both c and d are still in Pab. Let c be the intersection of

the line through a and c and the segment p0p1, and let d be the intersection

of the line through b and d and the segment p3p4. See Figure 17. Let  =

|ac | + K|c d | + |d b| - K|ab|, and let  = |ap1| + K|p1p3| + |p3b| - K|ab|.

We split the analysis into three steps that

Figure 18: Finding the longest distance from a to b when c and d are in Pab,

Substituting Lemma 18 for Lemma 14 in the proof of Theorem 1 brings the spanning ratio of the 5-graph down to 5.70. We are left with proving Lemmas 15, 16, and 17, which is done in the next three subsections.

4.1 Proof of Lemma 15

Lemma 15 states that |ac| + |bd| + K|cd| - K|ab|  |ac | + |bd | + K|c d | - K|ab| for K  5.70. See Figure 18a. Let e be the intersection of ac and bd, and let e be the intersection of br and a . Observe that  e r = 2/5, and thus we can see that dec  2/5. This implies that dec cannot be the smallest angle in dec, since that would require dec  /3. Thus at least one of dce and edc is the smallest angle in dec. Since we have applied Transformation 1, and can thus assume that  = /10, the cases are symmetric. We can therefore, without loss of generality, assume that dce is the smallest angle in dec.

Lemma 15. For all K  5.70,    .

Proof. Since c lies on ac and d lies on bd , we have |ac|  |ac | and |bd|  |bd |,

and it is sufficient to show that |cd|  |c d |. We first show that |cd|  |c d|.

Since dce is the smallest angle in dec, dce < /3. That implies that

c cd > /2, which implies that c d is the longest side of triangle cc d, and

thus |cd|  |c d|. See Fig.18a.

We now show that |c d |  |c d|. If c dd  /2, then c d is the longest side

of c dd , and |c d |  |c d| and we are done. Otherwise assume c dd < /2.

The

law

of

sines

tells

us

that

|c d sin c

| dd

=

|c d| sin dd

c

.

Since

sin 

is

an

increasing

function for 0   < /2, showing that c dd  dd c is sufficient to show

|c d |  |c d|, as it would imply both angles are < /2. Observe that c dd 

c ed and ed c = dd c , thus it is sufficient to prove that c ed  ed c .

Observe that ced = c ed  2/5. We now find the maximum of dd c =

ed c  2/5. Observe that if c moves left, ed c increases, thus assume c is

at p1. Let O(bp3c ) be the circle through b, p3, and c with center o. Observe that o lies on br . Observe that r bd = /10, thus r op3 = /5. Segment or makes an angle of /10 with the horizontal line through o. Thus od makes
an angle of 3/10 with the horizontal line through o, and thus the line tangent
to O(bp3c ) at p3 is the line supporting r , since r makes an angle of 3/10 with the vertical line through . See Figure 18b. That implies that [p2, p3) lies outside of O(bp3c ), which means for every point d , ed c  ep3c = 2/5, and thus c dd  dd c as required.

4.2 Proof of Lemma 16
Observe that |ap1| + K|p1p3| + |p3b| = |ap0| + K|p0p2| + |p2b| when  = /10, since Tab and Tba are the same size and the cases are symmetric. We prove that
 = |ac | + K|c d | + |d b| - K|ab|  |ap1| + K|p1p3| + |p3b| - K|ab| =  = |ap0| + K|p0p2| + |p2b| - K|ab|.
Lemma 16. For all K  5.70,    .
Proof. (Figure 19) Without loss of generality, we assume that |p1c |  |p2d |. We show that  is maximized when c = p1 and d = p3.
(Figure 20a) Observe that |p1p2|  |c d |  |p1p3|. Let z be a point on p2p3 that moves from p2 to p3, and observe that |p1z| takes on every value from |p1p2| to |p2p3|. Thus there must be a point q on p2p3 such that |p1q| = |c d |.
We claim that |ap1| + |bq|  |ac | + |bd |, which implies that   |ap1| + K|p1q| + |qb| - K|ab|.
Observe |ap1|  |ac |, since p1c a > /2, making ap1 the longest edge in triangle ac p1. We claim that q is between d and p2, and thus |bq|  |bd | since bd q > /2. By contradiction, assume that q is between d and p3. Since |p1c |  |p2d |, qd c > /2, which implies that |c q| > |c d |. Also note that qd p1 > /2, which implies |p1q| > |c q| > |c d |, a contradiction. Thus assuming that c = p1 and d = q does not decrease  .

Now, given that c is on p1, we show that   |ac | + |bp3| + K|c p3|, that

is, when d is on p3. To do this we define another function  = |ac | + |d p3| +

|p3b|+K|c d |-K|ab|. See Figure 20b. Since |bd |  |d p3|+|p3b| by the triangle

inequality,   , and observe that  =  =  when d = p3. We show

that  is maximized when d = p3, thus implying that  is also maximized

when d = p3, and    . Let  = p2p1d . We allow d to move along p2p3

until d is on p3, and fix all other points, and observe how  changes with .

We first rewrite  as  = |ac |+|p2p3|-|p2d |+|p3b|+K|c d |-K|ab|. Using

Observe that 0    3/10. The denominator of (1) is always positive. The
numerator of (1) is minimized at  = 0, which for K  5.70 is positive. Thus (1) is always positive for 0    3/10, thus  is increasing in , and is maximized when d = p3, as required. Thus      = |ap1| + K|p1p3| + |p3b| - K|ab| as required.

5 Open Problems
Using a few simple geometric observations and arguments, we have lowered the spanning ratio of 5 from 9.96 to 5.70, bringing us closer to the lower bound of 3.798 and thus a tight bound. The obvious open problem that remains is closing the gap between the upper and lower bound on the spanning ratio of the 5-graph.
