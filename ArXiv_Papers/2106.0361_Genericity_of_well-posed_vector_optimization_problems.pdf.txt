GENERICITY OF WELL-POSED VECTOR OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS
MATTEO ROCCA
Abstract. In this paper we consider well-posedness properties of vector optimization problems with objective function f : X  Y where X and Y are Banach spaces and Y is partially ordered by a closed convex pointed cone with nonempty interior. The vector well-posedness notion considered in this paper is the one due to Dentcheva and Helbig [5], which is a natural extension of Tykhonov well-posedness for scalar optimization problems. When a scalar optimization problem is considered it is possible to prove (see e.g. [22]) that under some assumptions the set of functions for which the related optimzation problem is well-posed is dense or even more in "big" i.e. contains a dense G set (these results are called genericity results). The aim of this paper is to extend these genericity results to vector optimzaition problems.
1. Introduction
Well-posedness properties are important qualitative characterizations for scalar and vector optimization problems. In particular, the notion of wellposedness plays a central role in stability theory for scalar optimization (see e.g. [6]). The well-posedness notion for scalar functions dates back to Hadamard [12] and to Tykhonov in [27]. Extensions to vector and set-valued cases are presented in several papers and are still a topic of research (see e.g. [1], [2],[20], [5], [6], [22], [24], [15], [16], [11], [4]). In [24] a classification of vector well-posedness notions in two classes is given: pointwise and global notions. The definitions of the first group consider a fixed efficient point (or the image of an efficient point) and deal with well-posedness of the vector optimization problem at this point. This approach imposes that the minimizing sequences related to the considered point are well-behaved. Since in the vector case the solution set is typically not a singleton, there is also a class of definitions, the so-called global notions, that involve the efficient frontier as a whole. In the scalar optimization, a crucial point is the identification of classes of objective functions for which the related optimization problem enjoys wellposedness properties. It is known (see e.g. [6]) that scalar optimization problems with convex objective function f : X  R, X finite-dimensional,

enjoy well-posedness properties. Similarly, it is known that vector optimzation problems with cone-convex objective function functions f : X  Y with X and Y finite-dimensional, enjoy well posedness properties (see. eg. [24]). When functions f : X  R with X infinite-dimensional are considered, it is known that convexity does not guarantee well-posedness (see e.g. [6]). In this case it is interesting to find sets of functions for which the subset of well-posed functions is dense (when a suitable topology on the considered set of functions is introduced). A stronger version of these results leads to find sets of functions for which the subset of well-posed funcions is "big" in the sense of Baire category, i.e. contains a dense G set (see e.g. [17], [22] and references therein). The aim of this paper is to extend this kind of results, called genericity results, to vector optimzation problems with objective function f : X  Y where X and Y are Banach spaces. In our investigation we will focus on the pointwise well-posedness notion for vector functions due to Dentcheva and Helbig [5]. The outline of the paper is the following. In Section 2 we introduce the notation and we recall some preliminary notions. In Section 3 we recall some scalar and vector well-posedness notions. In Section 4 we give results concerning density of well-posed vector optimization problems, without convexity assumptions. Section 5 is devoted to genericity results under cone-convexity assumptions.

2. Preliminaries
Let X and Y be Banach spaces, f : X  Y and C  Y a closed, convex, pointed cone with nonempty interior, endowing Y with a partial order in the following way

(2.1)

y1 C y2  y2 - y1  C y1 <C y2  y2 - y1  int C

In the following for a set A  X we denote by diam A the diameter of A, i.e.
diam A = sup{ x - y : x, y  A}
We denote respectively by B the closed unit ball both in X and Y (from the context it will be clear to which space we refer). We denote by Y  the topological dual space of Y and by C the positive polar cone of C, i.e.
C = {  Y  : , c  0, c  C}

Consider the vector optimization problem

(X, f )

min f (x), x  X.

A point x¯  X is called an efficient solution for problem (X, f ) when

(f (X) - f (x¯))  (-C) = {0}

We denote by Eff (X, f ) the set of all efficient solutions for problem (X, f ). A point x¯  X is called a weakly efficient solution for problem (X, f ) when

(f (X) - f (x¯))  (-int C) = .

We denote by WEff (X, f ) the set of weakly efficient solutions for problem (X, f ). We recall also (see e.g.[3]) that a point x¯  X is said to be a strictly efficient solution for problem (X, f ) when, for every  > 0, there exists  > 0 such that

(2.2)

(f (X) - f (x¯))  (B - C)  B

We denote by StEff(X, f ) the set of strictly efficient solutions for problem (X, f ). Clearly StEff(X, f )  Eff (X, f )  WEff(X, f ).

Definition 2.1. [21] A function f : X  Y , is said to be C-convex if x, z  X and t  [0, 1] it holds

f (tx + (1 - t)z)  tf (x) + (1 - t)f (z) - C

Proposition 2.2. (see e.g. [21]) f : X  Y is C-convex if and only if functions g(x) = , f (x) are convex for every   C.

We recall also that a function f : X  Y is said to be -quasiconvex when functions g(x) = , f (x) are quasiconvex for every   C (see e.g.
[19]). For y  Y , LCf (y) := {x  X : f (x)  y - C} is the level set of f . We say that f : X  Y is C-lower semicontinuous (C-lsc for short) when LCf (y) is closed for every y  Y [21].
Now, we recall, the notion of oriented distance between a point y  Y and
a set A  Y , denoted by DA(y).

Definition 2.3. For a set A  Y the oriented distance is the function DA : Y  R  {±} defined as

(2.3)

DA(y) = dA(y) - dY \A(y)

with d(y) = +.

Function DA was introduced in [13, 14] to analyze the geometry of nonsmooth optimization problems and obtain necessary optimality conditions. The next result summarizes some basic properties of function DA.

Proposition 2.4. [28, 8] If the set A is nonempty and A = Y , then
1. DA is real valued; 2. DA is 1-Lipschitzian; 3. DA(y) < 0 for every y  int A, DA(y) = 0 for every y  A and
DA(y) > 0 for every y  int (Y \A); 4. if A is closed, then it holds A = {y : DA(y)  0};

5. if A is convex, then DA is convex; 6. if A is a cone, then DA is positively homogeneouos; 7. if A is a closed convex cone, then DA is nonincreasing with respect
to the ordering relation induced on Y , i.e. the following is true: if y1, y2  Y then y1 - y2  A  DA(y1)  DA(y2); if A has nonempty interior, then y1 - y2  int A  DA(y1) < DA(y2): 8. It holds

where A denotes the boundary of the set A.

Theorem 2.5. [24] If f : X  Y is C-convex, then for every y  Y , function D-C (f (x) - y) is convex.

We associate to problem (X, f ) the scalar problem

(X, D-C )

min D-C(f (x) - f (x¯)) , x  X

with x¯  X. The relations of the solutions of this problem with those of problem (X, f ) are investigated in [28, 24, 8]. For the convenience of the reader, we quote the characterization of efficient points and weakly efficient points.

Theorem 2.6. [28, 24, 8] Let f : X  Y .
1. x¯  WEff (X, f ) if and only if x¯ is a solution of problem (X, D-C ). 2. If x¯ is the unique solution of problem (X, D-C ), then x¯  Eff (X, f ).

3. Well-posedness for scalar and vector optimization problems
3.1. Well-posedness for scalar optimization problems. In this section we recall the notion of well-posednsess for functions f : X  R introduced by Tykhonov [27]. For a complete treatment of this notion and of its generalizations one can refer to [6, 22]. Clearly in this case problem (X, f ) reduces to a scalar minimization problem.
Definition 3.1. Let f : X  R. Problem (X, f ) is said to be Tykhonov well-posed (T-wp for short) if:
1. there exists a unique x¯  X such that f (x¯)  f (x), x  X; 2. every sequence xn such that f (xn)  infX f is such that xn  x¯.
Next proposition provides a useful characterization of Tykhonov wellposedness. It is called the Furi-Vignoli criterion [7].
Proposition 3.2. Let f : X  R be lsc. The following alternatives are equivalent:
1. Problem (X, f ) is T-wp; 2. infa>infXf diam Lf (a) = 0, where Lf (a) = {x  X : f (x)  a}.

The following result regarding well-posedness of convex functions defined on a finite-dimensional space is well-known.

Theorem 3.3. (see e.g. [6]) Let X be finite-dimensional and f : X  R be a convex function with a unique minimizer. Then problem (X, f ) is T-wp.

Theorem 3.3 does not hold when X is infinite-dimensional as the following example shows (see e.g. [6]).

Example 3.4. Let X be a separable Hilbert space with orthonormal basis

{en, n  N}. Let f (x) =

+ n=1

x,en n2

.

Then f

is continuous, convex and

has x¯ = 0as unique minimizer, but problem (X, f ) is not T-wp. Indeed the sequence nen is an unbounded minimizing sequence.

Consider now the space

 := {f : X  R : f is convex and lower semicontinuous} .

We endow  with a distance compatible with the uniform convergenge on bounded sets. Fix   X and set for any two functions f, g   and i  N,

f - g i = sup |f (x) - g(x)|.
x- i

If f - g i =  for some i, then set d(f, g) = 1, otherwise

d(f, g) =

When X is infinite-dimensional, it can be shown that the set of functions f   such that problem (X, f ) is T-wp is "big" in the sense that contains a dense G set (see e.g. [22])

Theorem 3.5. [22] Let X be a Banach space and consider the set , equipped with the topology of uniform convergence. Then the set of functions f   such that problem (X, f ) is T-wp contains a dense G set .

If the convexity assumption is dropped weaker variants of Theorem 3.5 hold, in which density of the class of functions f   such that problem (X, f ) is T-wp is proven. Next results (see e.g. [22]) will be useful in the following.

Proposition 3.6. Let f : X  R, assume f has a minimum point x¯  X and let g(x) = f (x) + a x - x¯ with a > 0. Then problem (X, g) is T-wp.

Theorem 3.7. (Ekeland's Variational Principle) Let f : X  R be a lsc, lower bounded function. Let  > 0, r > 0 and x¯  X be such that f (x¯) < infX f + r. Then, there exists x^  X enjoying the following properties:
1. x^ - x¯ < r; 2. f (x^) < f (x¯) -  x¯ - x^ ; 3. Problem (X, g) with g(x) = f (x) +  x^ - x is T-wp.

3.2. Well-posedness for vector optimization problems. Several generalizations of the notion of well-posedness to vector functions have been proposed. We refer to [24] for a survey on the topic and a study of the relations among different well-posednsess concepts. In that paper vector well-posedness notions have been divided in two classes: pointiwise and global notions. Notions in the first class define the well-posedness of a vector problem with respect to a fixed efficient solution, while in the global notions the set of efficient solutions or weakly efficient solutions is considered as a whole. In this paper we focus on the notion of well-posedness due to Dentcheva and Helbig [5] (DH-well-posedness) which is a pointwise notion according to [24].
Definition 3.8. Let f : X  R. Problem (X, f ) is said to be DH-well-posed (DH-wp for short) at x¯  Eff (X, f ) if

c  C,

where LCf (f (x¯) + c) = {x  X : f (x)  f (x¯) + c - C}.

In [24] it has been proven that DH- well-posedness is the strongest among the pointwise well-posedness notions, that is if problem (X, f ) is DH-wp at x¯  X then it is well-posed at x¯ according to the other pointwise wellposedness notions known in the literature. The next result gives a useful characterization of DH­well-posedness.

Theorem 3.9. [11, 24] Problem (X, f ) is DH-well-posed at x¯  Eff (X, f ) if and only if problem (X, D-C ) is T-wp.

The following theorem (see [24]) gives a generalization of Theorem 3.3.

Theorem 3.10. Let X and Y be finite-dimensional. Assume f : X  Y is a C-convex function, x¯  Eff (X, f ) and f -1(f (x¯)) = {x¯}. Then problem
(X, f ) is DH-wp at x¯.

DH-well-posedness imposes some restrictions on the set Eff (X, f ). Indeed, if problem (X, f ) is DH-well-posed at x¯  Eff (X, f ) then x¯  StEff (X, f ). This property is typical of the vector case and shows that most of the vector well-posedness notions require implicitly stronger properties than the simple good behavior of minimizing sequence

Theorem 3.11. [24] If F : X  Y is continuous and problem (X, f ) is DH-wp at x¯  Eff (X, f ), then x¯  StMin (X, f ).

4. Density of DH-well-posed functions
The first result in this section shows that if the set of functions H = {f : X  Y : Eff (X, f ) = }
is endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets, then the set of functions g  H enjoying DH-wp properties is dense in H.

Theorem 4.1. Let f  H. Then, for every x¯  Eff (X, f ), there exists a sequence of functions fn : X  Y such that fn  f in the uniform convergence on bounded sets, x¯  Eff (X, fn) for every n and problem (X, fn) is DH-wp at x¯. Further, if f is continuous then x¯  StEff (X, fn) for every n.

Proof. Let k0  int C be fixed and consider the sequence of functions

fn(x)

=

f (x)

+

1 n

x - x¯

k0

Since x¯  Eff (X, f ), it holds

(4.1)

f (x) - f (x¯)  -C, x  X, x = x¯

Hence

f (x¯)

k0  -C,

x  X,

x = x¯

since (4.1) holds. Hence x¯  Eff (X, fn) n. Since Eff (X, fn)  WEff (X, fn), Theorem 2.6 implies D-C(fn(x)-fn(x¯))  0 for every x  X. Now we prove problem (X, fn) is DH-wp at x¯ for every n. From Theorem 3.9 we know that problem (X, f ) is DH-wp at x¯  X if and only if the scalar problem (X, D-C ) is T-wp at x¯. Since int C = , C has a closed convex weak-compact base

(4.2)

G = {  C : , k0 = 1}

(see e.g. [18]). According to [24] there exists a constant  > 0 such that

For a fixed n, let xk be a minimizing sequence for D-C(fn(x) - fn(x¯)), that is D-C (fn(xk) - fn(x¯))  0. If xk  x¯ we get

fn(x¯))

which contradicts to xk minimizing sequence for D-C(fn(x) - fn(x¯)) (the last inequality follows since x¯  Eff (X, f ) implies maxG , f (xk)-f (x¯)  0 x  X) . Hence xk  x¯ and problem (X, fn) is DH-wp at x¯. Finally, we get the desired result observing that fn  f in the uniform convergence
on bounded sets. If f is continuous, then apply Theorem 3.11 to conclude

the proof.

To prove the second density result in this section we need the following definition and the next lemma.

Definition 4.2. [11] We say that f : X  Y is C-bounded from below by   C\{0} when infxX , f (x) > -.

Let x¯  Eff (X, f ), consider function h¯(x) = ¯, f (x)
and the associated scalar minimization problem

(X, h¯)

min h¯(x) , x  X

Lemma 4.3. Let x¯  Eff (X, f ) and ¯  C\{0}. If problem (X, h¯) is T-wp at x¯, then problem (X, f ) is DH-wp at x¯.

Proof. Without loss of generality let ¯  C  B. Assume problem (X, f )
is not DH-wp at x¯. Since x¯  Eff (X, f )  WEff(X, f ), by Theorem 2.6 it
holds D-C(f (x) - f (x¯))  0, for every x  X and by Theorem 3.9 problem (X, D-C ) is not T-wp. Then there exists a sequence xn  X such that D-C(f (xn) - f (x¯))  0 but xn  x¯. Since, by Proposition 2.4

D-C (f (xn) - f (x¯))

=

max
 C   B

, f (xn) - f (x¯)

it follows D-C (f (xn) - f (x¯))  ¯, f (xn) - f (x¯) = h¯(xn) - h¯(x¯)

Since problem (X, h¯) is T-wp at x¯, it follows that x¯ is a minimum point for h¯ and hence h¯(xn) - h¯(x¯) = ¯, f (x) - f (x¯)  0 n. From D-C (f (xn) -
f (x¯))  0 it follows h¯(xn)  h¯(x¯) which contradicts problem (X, h¯) is T-wp since xn  x¯.

In the next result we drop the asumption Eff (x, f ) =  and we show that if the set of functions
H = {f : X  Y :    C such that f is C - bounded from below by }

is endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets, then the set of functions g  H enjoying DH-wp properties is dense in H. We endow H with a distance compatible with the uniform convergenge
on bounded sets (see e.g. [22]). Fix   X and set for any two functions f, g  H and i  N,

f - g i = sup f (x) - g(x) .

and problem (X, h¯) is T-wp at x¯. Let

and observe that since x¯ minimizes h¯(x), it holds h¯(x) - h¯(x¯) = ¯, h(x) - h(x¯) > 0, x  X\{x¯}

The next result shows that under some hypotheses, the assumption in Theorem 4.4 is weaker than the assumption in Theorem 4.1. We recall the following fundamental result.

Theorem 4.5. (Sion's Minimax Theorem [25, 26]) Let Z be a compact convex subset of a linear topological space and W a convex subset of a linear topological space. Let g be a real-valued function on Z × W such that
i) g(·, w) is upper semicontinuous and quasi-concave on Z w  W ; ii) g(z, ·) is lower semicontinuous and quasi-convex on W z  Z.

Then supzZ infwW f (z, w) = infwW supzZf (z, w)
Proposition 4.6. Let f : X  Y be -quasiconvex and C-lsc with respect to x  X, for every   C. Then, if Eff (X, f ) = , there exists ¯  C\{0} such that f is C-bounded from below by ¯.

Proof. Assume Eff (X, f ) =  and let x¯  Eff (X, f ). Ab absurdo assume that for every   C\{0} it holds

inf , f (x) = inf , f (x) - f (x¯) = -

xX

xX

Since int C = , C has a weak-compact base G. Function g(, x) = , f (x) - f (x¯) ,   G, x  X, is linear and continuous with respect to  and quasiconvex with respect to x. Further, since f is C-lsc with respect to x  X, g(, x) is lsc with respect to x  X. Since x¯  Eff (X, f ), it holds maxG , f (x) - f (x¯)  0 for every x  X. Apply Sion's Minimax Theorem to get the following chain of equalities

- = sup inf , f (x) - f (x¯) = inf sup , f (x) - f (x¯)

G xX

xX G

which implies there exists x~  X such that supG , f (x~) - f (x¯) < 0. A contradiction to x¯  Eff (X, f ).

Generalized convexity assumptions in the previous reult cannot be removed as the following example shows.
Example 4.7. Let X = R, Y = R2, C = C = R2+, f : X  Y defined as f (x) = (x, -xex) is not -quasiconvex. We have Eff(X, f ) = [0, +) =  but for any   C\{0} we have infxX , f (x) = -. Hence does not exist   C\{0} such that , f (x) is bounded from below.

5. Genericity of DH-well-posedness for C-convex functions
In this section we show that the set of C-convex and C-lsc functions enjoying DH-well-posedness properties contains a dense G set. To prove the main theorem in this section we need some preliminary results.
Proposition 5.1. Let f : X  R a convex and lsc function, x¯  X and set g(x) = f (x) + a x - x¯ , a > 0,   1. Then lim x + g(x) = +. Furthermore g(x) is lower bounded.
Proof. We prove that for every sequence xn  X with xn  + it holds limn+ g(xn) = +. Denote by X the topological dual space of X. Since f (x) is convex, the set f (x¯)  X of all subgradients of f at x¯ is nonempty and by definition of subgradient [10], for every continuous linear

(the last equality follows since a continuous linear functional is bounded). To prove that g(x) is lower bounded observe that for every M  R, there exists k > 0 such that g(x) > M for x > k. If we take A = {x  X : x  k}, g(x) is lower bounded on the bounded set A (see e.g. [22]), which concludes the proof.

Corollary 5.2. Let f : X  Y be a C-convex, C-lsc function and for   C\{0} and a > 0,   1 set g(x) = , f (x) + a x - x0 . Then, lim x + g(x) = + and g is lower bounded.
Proof. The proof follows from Proposition 5.1 since f C-convex and C-lsc implies g convex and lsc for every   C\{0}.

Let F be the set of C-convex and C-lsc functions f : X  Y . We endow F with the distance defined by (4.3), compatible with the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets.

Theorem 5.3. Let F be the set of C-convex and C-lsc functions endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets and let F~ be the
set of functions f  F such that Eff (X, f ) =  and problem (X, f ) is DH-wp at some point x¯  Eff (X, f ). Then F~ contains a dense G set .

Proof. The initial argument of the proof is inspired to that of Theorem 2.1 in [23]. If we fix k0  int C, we can find ¯  C such that ¯, k0 = 1. Consider the set
Z = {z : X  R such that z(x) = ¯, f (x) , f  F}

Since f is C-lsc, z is lsc. Endow Z with the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets and let S : F  Z be the map S(f ) = z, with z defined as before. Then S is a continuous map. Let

(5.1)

An

= {z

Z

: a > inf z,
xX

diam Lz(a) <

1 n

}

where Lz(a) = {x  X : z(x)  a}. Observe that Lz(a) are closed convex sets since z is convex and lsc. Then, it is known (see e.g. [22]) that if zn  z in the uniform convergence, then diam Lzn(a)  diam Lz(a), which gives continuity of the diam function. Hence An is an open set for all n and this implies S-1(An) is an open set for all n. We claim that the set W of

12

those functions h  F such that problem (X, S(h)) is T-wp is dense in F.

Since

+
W = S-1(An)

n=1

then it is a G set i.e. the countable intersection of open sets. Let f  F,

and

take

that

setting

it

holds

d(f, g)

.

Setting

g¯(x)

=

¯, g(x)

we have lim x + g¯(x) = + and

g¯ is lower bounded by Corollary 5.2. The proof now follows along the lines

of Theorem 4.4. We can find M > 0 such that

{x  X : g(x)  inf g(x) + 1}  B(, M )
xX
Let h : X  Y be defined as

h(x) = g(x) +  x - x¯ k0

and let s =

+ k=0

(k

k0

.

Apply Theorem 3.7 with  =

 2s

and

arbitrary r to find a point x¯ = x¯  X such that x¯ -   M , x¯ is the

unique minimizer of

S(h)(x) = ¯, g(x) +  x - x¯

and problem (X, S(h)) is T-wp at x¯ and hence h  W. This implies that problem (X, h) is DH-wp at x¯ by Lemma 4.3. Now observe that

h(x) - g(x) i   k0 (i + M )

It

follows

d(h, g)

 s =

 2

and

then

d(f, h)

<

.

Hence

F

contains

a

dense

G set, which concludes the proof.
