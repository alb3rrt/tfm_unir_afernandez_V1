COMPACT RETRACTIONS AND THE -PROPERTY OF BANACH SPACES
PETR HA´ JEK AND RUBE´N MEDINA
Abstract. In the present note we focus on Lipschitz retractions of a separable Banach space X onto its closed and convex generating subsets K. Our results are concerning the case when K is in some quantitative sense small, namely when certain finite dimensional subspaces En of X are sufficiently close to the points of K \En. Under such assumptions we obtain a near characterization of the -property (resp. Finite Dimensional Decomposition property) of a separable Banach space X. In one direction, if X admits the Finite Dimensional Decomposition (which is isomorphically equivalent to the metric--property) then we construct a Lipschitz retraction onto a (small) generating convex compact K. On the other hand, we prove that if X admits a small (in a precise sense) generating compact Lipschitz retract then X has the -property. It seems to be an open problem whether the -property is isomorphically equivalent to the metric--property (a positive answer would turn our results into a complete characterization). We also give an example of a small generating convex compact which is not a Lipschitz retract of C[0, 1], although it is contained in a small convex Lipschitz retract and contains another one. In the final part of our note we prove that a convex and compact set K in any Banach space with a Uniformly Rotund in Every Direction norm is a uniform retract, of every bounded set containing it, via the nearest point map.
1. Introduction
The main topic of our note is the study of Lipschitz (or more generally uniformly continuous) retractions of a Banach space onto its norm compact and convex subsets.
The study of retractions is a large area of research in topology and nonlinear analysis with many applications. We will not attempt to give any detailed overview in this introduction, and instead we refer to the first two chapters of the authoritative monograph [BL00] for some fundamental results and the general point of view.

We would like to point out two special cases of retractions in the Banach space setting, which are closely related to our present results. The first case is that of the unit ball BX. Then the radial projection mapping from the Banach space X onto BX can be shown to have a Lipschitz constant at most 2, [DW64].
Figueiredo and Karlovitz [FK67] proved that a real normed linear space of dimension 3 or higher is an inner product space if and only if the radial projection onto the unit ball is nonexpansive (see also [Phe58], [Sch65]).
For more general sets C a natural candidate for the retraction mapping is the nearest point map (sometimes also called the proximity map, of which the radial projection is a special case), provided the nearest point is unique. Again, it turns out that such mapping is nonexpansive for every closed convex set if and only if the space is Hilbertian [Phe58]. In fact, in the papers [Bru74] [FK70], the following characterization is shown: Let X be a strictly convex Banach space with 3  dim(X); then there exists a nonexpansive retraction onto the unit ball if and only if X is a Hilbert space. The restriction to dimension at least 3 is necessary. Karlovitz [Kar72] shows that if X is 2-dimensional then a non-expansive retraction onto any closed convex set always exists and it can be realized as a proximity mapping with respect to a new norm which can further be identified with the norm of the dual space X.
Another important special case of the problem is when the set C is a (e.g finite dimensional, or reflexive) subspace of X. Then, using the results in [HM82], the existence of a - Lipschitz retraction of the Banach space X onto C implies the existence of a -bounded linear projection. So this problem belongs to the vast area of research related to the best projectional constants for finite dimensional linear subspaces, see e.g. [TJ89], resp. the problem of recognizing complemented subspaces of a given Banach space.
The results in our paper were originally motivated by the question asked by Godefroy and Ozawa in[GO14] (and then subsequently in [God15a], [God15b], [God20], and [GLP19]) whether every separable Banach space admits a generating convex and compact Lipschitz retract (GCCR, for short). By a generating set of a Banach space X we mean C such that the closed linear span of C is the whole space X. We will say that C is a -GCCR if it is a GCCR and there exists a -Lipschitz retraction from X onto C.
This question is closely related with the problem whether every separable Banach space is (Lipschitz) approximable (for definitions, see the next section). Indeed, the existence of a Lipschitz retractable compact easily implies that the space is Lipschitz approximable.
Our first result (Theorem 3.3) is that a Banach space X with an FDD admits a GCCR. Moreover, if X has a monotone FDD, then it has a (5 + )GCCR, for every  > 0. If X has a monotone Schauder basis, it has a (1 + )-GCCR, for every  > 0. Our GCCR is roughly speaking a diamond shaped set, and the retraction mapping is somehow aligned with the canonical projections but it is certainly not the nearest point map. This is in

COMPACT RETRACTS

sharp contrast with the easy construction of a box-shaped GCCR in Banach spaces with an uncoditional Schauder basis (as noted in [GO14]).
The compact sets used in our arguments are in some sense small. Later on, for the purposes of proving results going in the opposite direction, we proceed by formally defining the quantitative concept of a small set, which is intuitively a generating compact subset of X that is contained in sufficiently small neighbourhoods of its finite dimensional sections. The smallness condition restricts the asymptotic behaviour of the compact set, in a certain sense, but it otherwise leaves a complete freedom as regards its possible shape. It is curious that both our positive results and the reverse results lead to small compacts of roughly the same size.
Our second, and perhaps main result of our note (Theorem 4.7), is that if a Banach space admits a small Lipschitz retract (in particular, a small GCCR) then it has the -property. Note that a Banach space with the metric -property has an FDD [Cas01] Thm. 6.4, and it is still open if the -property implies metric -property (and hence FDD) under an equivalent renorming. So our previous results combined together are possibly a characterization of the existence of an FDD property for the Banach space X in terms of the existence of Lipschitz retractions onto small GCCR. The proof is based on several deep ingredients. Of course, one would like to use the (Gateaux) differentiation theory for Lipschitz mappings in separable Banach spaces in order to pass from the compact Lipschitz retraction mapping to some linearization with a small range. However, it does not seem possible to do this directly using the abundance of points of Gateaux differentiability and averaging. Instead, our proof takes a detour, and produces the finite rank linear projections (needed for the -property) indirectly, only proving their existence. First, we pass from the small retract K to a finite dimensional subspace En, which contains the bulk of the points of K, in a certain sense. Of course, we do not immediately have in our hands a good Lipschitz retraction from X onto En, but using the "Lipschitzization" of coarse Lipschitz mapings due to Bourgain [Bou87] (in the formulation of Begun [Beg99]) we do have a good Lipschitz almost retraction to En from finite dimensional subspaces G of X, of controlled dimension, which contain En. Here comes handy another deep and yet unpublished result, due to Vitali Milman, communicated to us by Bill Johnson. Namely, the projection constant (En, X) of a n-dimensional subspace En of X is witnessed by (En, G) for a certain finite dimensional subspace G of X, of dimension roughly 5n. This surprising fact makes our subsequent argument easier and more powerful (and most importantly, quantitatively independent of the Banach space X). At this point we may use the differentiation theory and averaging in the finite dimensional setting, applied to the finite dimensional approximate version of our retraction (crucially using the smallness assumption for K) to produce a good linear projection from G to En. But this implies that (En, X) cannot be large, which eventually yields the -property for X.

We remark that our techniques above are applicable to small compacts only, and we do not know if analogous results hold for general convex compact subsets of X.
Using the same approach, we also give a variant of the result of Godefroy and Kalton in [GK03], who characterized the BAP property by means of a sequence of finite rank Lipschitz mappings convergent pointwise to the identity. Namely, using the finite rank Lipschitz retractions we characterize the -property.
We also note that if there is a Lipschitz retraction of X onto a convex compact set K, and Y is a closed linear subspace of X spanned by K, which is linearly complemented in its bidual Y , then Y is a complemented subspace of X. This means that a natural way of getting the Lipschitz retraction from X onto K is simply to compose the linear projection from X onto Y with a Lipschitz retraction from Y onto K.
In the next section, we give an example of a small compact convex set K in the space C[0, 1], which is contained in a small GCCR, and contains another small GCCR, but such that K is not a GCCR for the space C[0, 1]. This example underlines the subtlness of the existence of Lipschitz retractions, which depends on the precise shape of the set.
In our final section we proceed to the problem of uniformly continuous retractions onto convex compact sets. Our main result is that if a separable Banach space is equipped with a URED norm, then every convex compact subset is a uniformly continuous retract, from any bounded superset, with respect to the nearest point map. This result implies, in particular, that every convex compact set is an absolute uniform neighbourhood retract, a fact recently established in [CCW21]. The case of a general (nonseparable) space X is also treated.

2. Preliminaries
Our notation and terminology is standard. For the general concepts and results of Banach space theory we refer to [Fab+11]. The background on the various forms of the approximation property can be found in [Cas01]. For the theory of Lipschitz and uniform retracts we refer to the first two chapters in the monograph [BL00].
Let us now pass to some definitions and results which are used heavily in our note. We start with the formulation of several classical concepts related to the approximation property, in the growing generality.
A Schauder basis for a real Banach space X is a sequence (xn)  X with the property that for every x  X, there exists a unique sequence (n)  R such that
n
x - ixi -n-- 0.
i=1

COMPACT RETRACTS

In this case we say X has a Schauder basis and call the projections Pn(x) =
n
ixi the natural projections of the Schauder basis. If (xn) is a Schauder
i=1
basis in a Banach space X, then we denote by (xn) the coordinate functionals, which form a basic sequence in the dual space X.
Definition 2.1. A sequence (En) of finite dimensional subspaces of a Banach space X is called a finite dimensional decomposition (FDD for short) if for every x  X there is a unique sequence xn  En so that
n
x - xi -n-- 0.
i=1
n
In this case we say X has a FDD and call the projections Pn(x) = xi the
i=1
natural projections of the FDD.
If X is a Banach space with a Schauder basis (resp. FDD) then the natural projections of the basis (resp. FDD) are uniformly bounded. Moreover, X can be equivalently renormed so that this uniform bound is 1. In this case we say that the Schauder basis (resp. FDD) is monotone.
Definition 2.2. A Banach space X is said to have the -property if there is a uniformly bounded net of finite rank projections (S) on X converging strongly to the identity on X. If this uniform bound is   1 then we can say X has the -property. In the case  = 1 we say X has the metric -property.
Proposition 2.3 ([Cas01]). For a separable Banach space X and   1, the following are equivalent:
· X has the -property · There is a sequence of -bounded finite rank projections (Sn) on X
pointwise converging to the identity for which
SmSn = Sn m  n.
As we mentioned above, it still seems to be an open problem whether the -property is equivalent to the existence of an FDD for a separable Banach space.
Definition 2.4. Let X be a Banach space. If there is a uniformly bounded net of finite rank operators (T) on X tending strongly to the identity on X, then we say that X has the bounded approximation property (BAP for short). If   1 is a uniform bound for the net then we can say X has the -bounded approximation property (-BAP for short). We rename the 1-BAP as the metric approximation property (MAP for short).

If X is separable then this net can be chosen to be a sequence.

6

PETR HA´ JEK AND RUBE´ N MEDINA

Definition 2.5. Let X be a Banach space. If there is a net of finite rank operators (T) on X converging to identity on X uniformly on compacta, then we say that X has the approximation property (AP for short). If X is separable then this net can be chosen to be a sequence.

Definition 2.6. A Banach space X has the compact approximation property if for every  > 0 and every compact set K in X there is a compact operator T  L(X) so that ||T x - x||   for all x  K.

For an arbitrary Banach space X, the previously defined concepts are ordered from strongest to weakest, that is,

Schauder basis  FDD  -property  BAP  AP  CAP.

With the possible exception of FDD  -property , none of the above implications can be reversed ([Sza87],[Rea], [FJ73] and [Wil92]).
Let us pass to the non-linear approximation properties.

Definition 2.7. A map T from a metric space M into another metric space N is said to be Lipschitz if there exists some  > 0 such that

d(T (x), T (y))  d(x, y) x, y  M.

We call  the Lipschitz constant for T and we call the infimum of all Lipschitz constants for T the Lipschitz norm of T , that is,

d T (x), T (y)

||T ||Lip = inf  > 0, Lipschitz constant for T = sup
x,yM

d(x, y) .

If  > 0 is a Lipschitz constant for T we say T is -Lipschitz.

Definition 2.8. Let X be a Banach space. If there is a net of finite rank Lipschitz maps (T) on X, whose Lipschitz norms are uniformly bounded, converging uniformly on compacta to the identity on X, then we say that X has the Lipschitz bounded approximation property. If this net is bounded by   1 then we can say X has the -Lipschitz bounded approximation property.

Theorem 2.9 ([GK03] Theorem 5.3). Let X be an arbitrary Banach space. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
· X has the -BAP. · The free space over X, F(X) has the -BAP. · X has the -Lipschitz bounded approximation property.

Definition 2.10. A complete metric space M is approximable whenever there is a subadditive map  : [0, )  [0, ) with lim (t) = 0 so that for
t0
every finite set E  M and every  > 0 we can find a uniformly continuous map  : M  M such that d(x, (x)) <  for every x  E, (M ) is relatively compact and the modulus of continuity of  is bounded by . If (t) = Lt for some L > 0 then we say that M is Lipschitz approximable.

If M is separable then it is easy to see that M is approximable (resp.

Lipschitz approximable) if and only if there is an equi-uniformly continu-

ous (resp. equi-Lipschitz) sequence of maps n : M  M with relatively

compact

range

such

that

lim d(x,
n

n(x))

=

for

every

X.

These concepts were introduced and studied in several papers, [Kal04],

[Kal12] and [GLZ14].

Kalton proved in [Kal12] that every Banach space with a separable dual

(or a separable dual space itself) is approximable. It is still an open prob-

lem if every separable Banach space is approximable. Godefroy, on the

other hand, observed in [God20] that the compact approximation property

implies that the space is Lipschitz approximable, showing then that it is

strictly weaker than the AP.

In the next sections, we are going to make repeated use of the following concepts.

Definition 2.11. Let M be a metric space and N  M a metric subspace, then a retraction onto N is a map R : M  N such that R N = IdN , in this case we say N is retract of X. If R is Lipschitz (resp. uniformly continuous) we say R is a Lipschitz (resp. uniformly continuous) retraction onto N and N is a Lipschitz (resp. uniformly continuous) retract of M .
If N is a Lipschitz (resp. uniformly continuous) retract of M for every metric space M containing it, we say that N is an absolute Lipschitz (resp. uniformly continuous) retract.

We will say that a subset K of a Banach space X generates X whenever the closed linear span of K is equal to X. A Lipschitz retract K of a Banach space X such that K is convex, compact, and generates X is going to be called a generating convex compact retract (GCCR for short) of X.
Note that the existence of a GCCR implies the space is Lipschitz approximable.

Definition 2.12. Let N be a metric subspace of a metric space M , a proximity map (or a nearest point map) onto N is going to be a map R : M  N such that
d(R(x), x) = inf d(y, x) x  M.
yN
A proximity map may not exist in some situations and if it exists it may not be unique. If M is a uniformly convex Banach space then this map is known to be unique and uniformly continuous whenever N is a closed convex subset [Bjo79].

Definition 2.13. A normed space X is said to be uniformly rotund in the

direction z  X if whenever (xn) and (yn) are two sequences in X such that

(1) ||xn|| = ||yn|| = 1 for every n  N,

(2) lim
n

xn+yn 2

= 1,

8

(3) There is a sequence of real numbers (rn) such that xn - yn = rnz for every n  N,

then

lim
n

||xn

-

yn||

=

0.

In the case X is uniformly rotund in the direction z for every z  SX we

say it is uniformly rotund in every direction (URED for short).

3. Compact Lipschitz retracts

Let (X, || · ||) be a Banach space with a monotone FDD (Xn)nN whose natural projections are (Pn)nN. For every x  X and i  N we are going to denote xi = (Pi - Pi-1)(x) where P0  0. Let (rn)nN be an arbitrary decreasing sequence of positive real numbers. For every m  N we define the function
fm : X  R,

fm(x) = rm

1 - m-1 ||xi|| i=1 ri

, m  2,

and f1 : X  {r1} the constant function. We will define for n  N the following subsets of X

K = co

k=1

Finally, given n, m  N such that m n we consider En,m = Pm(X)  Kn,

Proof. Just consider Am = 2m. Then,

Now, to prove the second part of the lemma, let us define Gn-1,m : En,m  En-1,m-1 by

Gn-1,m(x) = Fn-1,m(Pn-1(x)) x  En,m.

Taking into account the previous defintions, it is immediate that

Gn-1,m(x) = Fn,m(Pn-1(x)) x  En,m.

Hence, it holds that gn := Fn,m - Gn-1,m = Pn - Pn-1.

xm ||xm||

Pn(x)

if m  n, if m = n + 1.

Now, if x, y  Pn(X), we claim that ||Fn(x) - Fn(y)||  5(1 + ). Indeed, let us consider

If m = n + 1 then Fn(x) - Fn(y) = x - y.

If m = n then Fn(x) = Fn,n(x) and Fn(y) = Fn,n(y) and we use Proposition 3.2 to finish this case.

If m = n - 1 then Fn(x) = Fn,n-1(Fn,n(x)) and Fn(y) = Fn,n-1(Fn,n(y)), and we know from the definition of m that x or y verifies (3.2), Proposition 3.2 for j = n. Hence, using Lemma 3.1 together with Proposition 3.2 we get that

||Fn(x) - Fn(y)|| = ||Fn,n-1(Fn,n(x)) - Fn,n-1(Fn,n(y))||

Otherwise, if m  n - 2 then

Fn(x) = Fn,m  · · ·  Fn,n(x) and Fn(y) = Fn,m  · · ·  Fn,n(y).
Also, from the definition of m we get that, if n  p  m + 2, the point Fn,p  · · ·  Fn,n(x) or the point Fn,p  · · ·  Fn,n(y) satisfy (3.2), Proposition 3.2 for j = p - 1. Also the point x or the point y satisfies (3.2) for j = n. Having this in mind and using the same argument as in the previous step,

It is easy to see that x  Pn(X), if k > n then Fk(x) = Fn(x) so we can define the following map

F : Pn(X)  co{rnBXn , n  N},

F

=

lim

Fn(x),

which is a 5(1 + )-Lipschitz retraction. Considering now R : X  K as the

extension of F to the whole X, we are done.

Remark

3.4.

We

can

actually

choose

qn

=

.

This

arises

from

choosing

n

=

2-n+1

and

so

that

n

=

2-n.

Notice that it is not possible to obtain a constant lower than 2 with our
construction for general FDD spaces, as the radial projection might be of
Lipschitz norm 2.
Next, we are going to treat the special case when the blocks of the FDD are
of dimension 1, that is when X has a Schauder basis, which leads to a much
better estimate on the Lipschitz norm of the retraction. From now on, dim(Pn - Pn-1)(X) = 1 for every n  N and (en, en)nN is
a monotone Schauder basis in X such that ||en|| = 1 for every n  N. The main difference between this case and the general one is stated in Proposition
3.5.

Proposition 3.5.

Fm,m is

rmAm-1 rm-1

-Lipschitz

m  N.

Proof. We are going to prove it case by case. We have already proved in

Proposition

3.2

the

case

when

m-1 ||yi|| i=1 ri

>

1

or

m-1 ||xi|| i=1 ri

>

1

,

so

let

us

assume

m-1 i=1

||xi|| ri



1

and

m-1 i=1

||yi|| ri



1.

If

m i=1

||xi|| ri



1

and

m i=1

||yi|| ri



1

then

Fm,m(x)

- Fm,m(y)

=

x-y

so

it

is

straightforward that ||Fm,m(x) - Fm,m(y)|| = ||x - y||.

If

m i=1

||xi|| ri



1

and

m i=1

||yi|| ri

>

1,

we

split

this

case

into

2

different

subcases.

For this subcases we are going to set

t

=

em(x)

-

em |em

(y) (y)|

fm(y

)

em(x) - em(y)

whenever em(x) = em(y) and t =  otherwise.

Subcase t  R  {} \ [0, 1].

In

this

subcase,

em (x) |em(x)|

=

em(y) |em(y)|

.

Indeed,

if

not,

as

|em(y)|

= ||ym||

> fm(y)

then

t

=

|em(x)| + fm(y) |em(x)| + |em(y)|



[0, 1].

This means that

t

=

|em(x)| - fm(y) |em(x)| - |em(y)|

,

and as |em(x)|-fm(y)  |em(x)|-|em(y)| we claim that |em(x)|-fm(y) > 0. In fact, we check case by case and obtain the following scheme

 if t = 

iiff

t<0 t>1

 |em(x)| - |em(y)| = 0  |em(x)| - fm(y) > 0,  |em(x)| - |em(y)| < 0  |em(x)| - fm(y) > 0,  |em(x)| - |em(y)| > 0  |em(x)| - fm(y) > 0.

Then,

em(x)

-

em(y) |em(y)|

fm(y)

= |em(x)|-fm(y)  |fm(x)-fm(y)| 

rmAm-1 rm-1

||x-y||,

16

PETR HA´ JEK AND RUBE´ N MEDINA

and we have

||Fm,m(x) - Fm,m(y)|| =

Pm-1(x - y) +

xm

-

ym ||ym

||

fm(y)

 ||x - y|| +

em(x)

-

em(y) |em(y)|

fm(y)



||x

-

y||

+

rmAm-1 rm-1

||x

-

y||.

The Subcase t  [0, 1] is simpler. Due to the convexity of the norm and the fact that ||Pm-1|| = 1 we have

||Fm,m(x) - Fm,m(y)|| = ||Pm-1(x - y) + t(xm - ym)||  ||x - y||,

so

we

are

finally

done

with

both subcases.

Now,

if

m i=1

||xi|| ri

>

1

and

m i=1

||yi|| ri

>

1 then ||xm|| > 0 and ||ym|| > 0 and we are also spliting this case into 2

subcases for technical reasons:

Subcase

xm ||xm||

=

ym ||ym||

.

Here,

xm ||xm||

fm(x)

-

ym ||ym||

fm(y)

=

|fm(x)

-

fm(y)|



rmAm-1 rm-1

||x

-

y||,

so then

||Fm,m(x) - Fm,m(y)|| =

Pm-1(x - y) +

xm ||xm||

fm(x)

-

ym ||ym||

fm(y)



1

+

rmAm-1 rm-1

||x - y||.

Finally,

for

the

subcase

when

xm ||xm||

=

-

ym ||ym||

we

consider

t = fm(x) + fm(y)  [0, 1], ||xm|| + ||ym||

and again by convexity,

||Fm,m(x) - Fm,m(y)|| = ||Pm-1(x - y) + t(xm - ym)||  ||x - y||.

4. -property and compact Lipschitz retractions

We pass to the results concerning the necessary conditions on the Banach space X so that X admits a GCCR K  X. Our methods require a certain quantitative "smallness" condition to be satisfied for K. Under such assumption we show that X must have -property. In fact, our argument makes no use of the convexity of K. The crucial condition is smallness. Our proof uses three main ingredients. The unpublished Milman lemma (communicated to us, with proof, by Bill Johnson) concerning the projection constant of a finite dimensional subspace of a Banach space, the finite dimensional "Lipschitzization" of coarse Lipschitz maps due to Bourgain (and streamlined by Begun), and the averaging of derivatives for finite dimensional Lipschitz maps. We start with a well-known fact.
Given r  R+, we are going to denote [r] = max{n  N  {0} : n  r}.

Lemma 4.1. For every n  N and   (0, 1), if E is a Banach space of
dimension n, there exists a new norm | · | in E such that (E, | · |) embeds isometrically in N where N = (1 + 2/)n and

|x|



||x||



|x| 1-

.

Proof. By Lemma 2.6 of [MS86], we know there exists an -net in SX

consisting of N points, namely {x1, . . . , xN }. Just consider the norm |x| =

max
i{1,...,N

}

xi (x).

If X is a Banach space and E  X is a subspace, then the projection constant of E in X is defined as

(E, X) = inf ||P || : P : X  E , P E = IdE .

Lemma 4.2 (Vitali Milman-unpublished). Let X be a Banach space. For

every   (0, 1/2) and a subspace E  X of dimension dim(E) = n, there is

another subspace GE  X containing E such that dim(GE ) 

1

+

2 

n and

(E, X)  2(E, GE ).

Proof. (communicated to us by Bill Johnson) We follow the trace duality arguments set up in [Joh+79]. Pick   (0, 1/2). For a given Banach space Y with a finite dimensional subspace E  Y we define a pair of norms on the space of all linear operators L(E)

||T ||Y = inf ||T || : T  L(Y, E) , T = T ,
E

||T ||Y = ||iET ||,

where iE : E  Y is the inclusion map and || · || refers to the nuclear norm in L(E, Y ), that is,

||T ||Y = inf

n

n

||xi || · ||yi|| : n  N, T = xi  yi, xi  E, yi  Y .

i=1

i=1

COMPACT RETRACTS

19

We know from [Joh+79] pg. 377 that both norms are in trace duality. More precisely, we have a dual pairing L(E), L(E) given by T, S = tr(ST ) for every T, S  L(E), such that
(L(E), || · ||Y ) = (L(E), || · ||Y ).

Thanks to this interpretation, we can compute

(E, Y ) = ||IdE||Y = sup tr(T IdE) = sup tr

||T ||Y =1

T L(E)

T ||T ||Y

= sup
T L(E)

1
T tr(T )

=

sup
tr(T )=1

||T

1 ||Y

=

inf

1 ||T

||Y

.

tr(T )=1

Y

So now we take, for  = (1 - )2 - 1/2 (E, X)-1 > 0, an operator of trace

equal to 1 S  L(E) such that

inf ||T ||X  ||S||X - .
tr(T )=1

We also take the norm |·| given by Lemma 4.1 so that (E, |·|) is isometrically

a subspace of (n) where (n) =

1

+

2 

n

and, denoting | · |Y the nuclear

norm taking (E, | · |) as the domain of the operators instead of (E, || · ||), we

have for every subspace Y  E that

||S||Y

 |S|Y



||S||Y 1-

.

It is well-known (Proposition 47.6 in [Tre06]) that iES admits an extension S : (n)  X almost preserving the nuclear norm, that is |S|X  (1 -
)||S||. By Proposition 8.7 from [TJ89] we know there exist x1, . . . , x(n) 
(n)
X such that S = ei  xi and
i=1

(n)

||S|| = ||xi||,

i=1

where ei  (n)  are the coordinate functionals. Just considering GE = [xi]i=(n1), we can see that

||S||X  (1 - )|S|X  (1 - )2||S||  (1 - )2|S|GE  ||S||GE (1 - )2.

Finally, taking into acount that (E, GE )  (E, X) we finish the proof because

Definition 4.3. Given X a separable Banach space, we will say that  = (en)  X is a fundamental sequence if [en] = X and we will denote En = [ei]ni=1.

Definition 4.4. Let X be a separable Banach space,  = (en) a fundamental sequence and K  X a bounded subset. We will define the following concepts:
· The sequence of inner radii (rn) given by
rn = sup r  0 : BEn (x, r)  K  En , x  X n  N.
· The sequence of heights (hn) given by
hn = sup d(x, En) : x  K n  N.

Definition 4.5. We say that a bounded subset K of a separable Banach
space X is small if there exist   (0, 1/2), a fundamental sequence  = (en) in X and a subsequence  : N  N strictly increasing such that

0<

(n) + 2

n  N.

Note that such sets are necessarily compact and generate X.

If  = (en) is a monotone Schauder basis and we call Xi = ei , then we

know from Theorem 3.3 and Remark 3.4 that for every sequence (rn)  R+

such that

rn rn-1

 qn

=

1 n2n+1

the compact K = co

rkBXk is a GCCR. In this case it is easily seen

kN

that there is C > 0 independent of n  N and X with

hn rn



C

qn n

=

n2

C 2n+1

,

where the right hand side of the inequality is a very similar sequence to the

one given in the definition of smallness.

More generally, it is easy to check using Remark 3.4 that the following

result holds.

Proposition 4.6. If a separable Banach space X has an FDD then X admits a small GCCR.

We now pass to the promised opposite implication. Note that the convexity assumption on the generating compact K is not needed.

Theorem 4.7. Let X be a separable Banach space. If there exists a Lipschitz retraction from X onto a small compact subset, then X has the -property.

COMPACT RETRACTS

21

Proof. Assume there is a Lipschitz retraction from X onto a small compact

K. Take   (0, 1/2),  = (en) a fundamental sequence of X and  : N  N

strictly increasing for which the inequality of Definition 4.5 holds true, and

rename (n) =

1

+

2 

(n)

,

En

=

E(n) ,

hn

=

h(n)

and

rn

=

r(n).

Lemma 4.2 guarantees that for every n  N there is a finite dimensional

subspace Gn  X of dimension dim(Gn) = (n) such that for every pro-

jection

P

: Gn

 En,

the norm

||P || 

(En 2

,X

)

.

Assume that

R:X

K

is the Lipschitz retraction, then taking Cn : K  En a nearest point map

(it may not be unique), we define Rn = (Cn  R) Gn : Gn  En for every n  N. Now,

||Rn(x) - Rn(y)||  ||R||

||x

-

y||

+

2hn ||R||

x, y  Gn,

so by the Proposition of [Beg99], for every  > 0, there is a onto Lipschitz

mapping

Rn, : Gn  En

such that

||Rn, ||Lip  ||R||

1

+

(n)hn ||R||

,

||Rn, (x) - Rn(x)||  ||R||



+

2hn ||R||

x  Gn.

Now

we

choose

n

=

(n)hn ||R||

,

and

define

Rn

:

Gn



En

by

Rn(x)

=

Rn,n (x +

xn) - xn, where xn  Kn := K  En is such that BEn(xn, rn)  Kn (which

exists by compactness). Hence we have that for every x  Kn + {-xn}

||Rn(x) - x|| = ||Rn,n (x + xn) - Rn(x + xn)||  hn((n) + 2) =: n. Now, let (ai, ai )i=(n1) be a normalized basis for Gn with projections (Si)i=(n1) such that (ai, ai )i=(n1) is an Auerbach basis for En. Then,
Bn = rnco {±ai , i = 1, . . . , (n)}  Kn + {-xn}.

Now we define for every k  N the compact

(n)

Bn,k = Bn + k

[-ai, ai]  Gn,

i=(n)+1

where k  R+ converges to 0. Let i  {1, . . . , (n)}, if we denote (Bn,k)i = (Id - ai ai)(Bn,k) and for some given xi  (Bn,k)i we call

xi(xi) =

(n)
rn - aj (xi) ai,
j=1 j=i

zi(xi) = Rn(xi + xi(xi)) - Rn(xi - xi(xi)) + 2xi(xi),

22

PETR HA´ JEK AND RUBE´ N MEDINA

then we have that
||zi(xi)||  Rn xi + xi(xi) - Rn S(n) xi + xi(xi) + Rn S(n) xi + xi(xi) - S(n) xi + xi(xi) + Rn S(n) xi - xi(xi) - Rn xi - xi(xi) + S(n) xi - xi(xi) - Rn S(n) xi - xi(xi)
2||Rn||(n)k + 2n.

For a set J  {1, . . . , (n)} with #J = m  1, we define the measure in [ai]iJ as

mJ (A) = m

ai A

iJ

A  MmJ ,

where m is the Lebesgue measure in Rm and MmJ = A  [ai]iJ :

ai A is Lebesgue measurable subset of Rm . If J = {1, . . . , (n)}
iJ
we are going to rename (n) = J(n) and for every i  {1, . . . , (n)}, if J = {1, . . . , (n)} \ {i}, we will denote i(n)-1 = J(n)-1. Then, we are ready to define the linear operators Pn,k : Gn  En for every k  N given
by

Pn,k (v)

=

1 (n)(Bn,k)

dRn (x)[v]d(n) (x).
Bn,k

Now we compute as in [Bra+14] pg. 47 the following measures for arbitrary i  {1, . . . , (n)}

i(n)-1 (Bn,k)i

=

2(n)-1 rn(n)-1 k(n)-(n) ((n) - 1)!

,

(n) Bn,k

=

2(n)rn(n)k(n)-(n) (n)!

,

so the quotient is

i(n)-1 ((Bn,k )i ) (n)(Bn,k)

=

(n) 2rn

.

As Bn,k = {u + w  Gn : u  (Bn,k)i , w  [-xi(xi), xi(xi)]}, thanks to Fubini's Theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus applied to the

Finally, we construct the projection Pn = norm

This implies that X has the -property since

(En, X)  2(En, Gn)  2||Pn||  16||R||2 n  N.

In Section 3 we have found a sequence (qn)  R+ such that for every

satisfying

that

there

is a -Lipschitz

retraction R(r) : X  K(r), where K(r) = co rkBXk for some FDD
kN
(Xn)nN. Let r = (rn) be such a sequence and denote for every k, m  N the sequence rk,m = (r1, . . . , rm, rm+1/k, . . . , rn/k, . . . ). Taking subsequences,
we may assume that for every x  X and every m  N there exists Rm(x) = lim R(rk,m)(x) which define retractions onto increasing finite dimensional
k
compacts. This leads to the -property for Lipschitz retractions.

Definition 4.8. Let X be a separable Banach space and  > 0. X has the Lipschitz -property if there exists an increasing sequence of finite

dimensional convex subsets (Cn) of X such that X = span(Cn) and
nN
there exists a -Lipschitz retraction Rn : X  Cn for every n  N.

Analogously to the case of the Lipschitz bounded approximation property (Theorem 2.9), we are going to prove that this new property is nothing else but the well-known -property. This result is a direct consequence of the next Theorem, which is mainly based on a result of Lindenstrauss in [Lin64], see Corollary 7.3 of [BL00].

Theorem 4.9. Let X be a Banach space, 1, 2 > 0 and Y  X a subspace 1-complemented in its bidual. If there is a 2-Lipschitz retraction from X onto a convex subset K containing 0 such that span(K) = Y then Y is
12-complemented in X.

Proof. Let R : X  K  Y be such a retraction. Without loss of generality we may assume R+K = Y . Then for every n  N we define the retraction Rn : X  nK given by Rn(x) = nR(x/n) for every x  X. By wcompactness we have a net (Rn) such that Rn(x) w-converge to some point in Y  for every x  X. Now, if L : Y   Y is a bounded linear
projection, we just define R : X  Y by

R(x)

=

L(lim


Rn (x))

x  X.

Finally R is a 12-Lipschitz retraction from X onto Y so by Corollary 7.3 of [BL00] we are done.

Corollary 4.10. Let X be a separable Banach space and  > 0. Then X has the Lipschitz -property if and only if it has the -property.
Proof. It is straightforward from Proposition 2.3 and Theorem 4.9.

5. Compacts without Lipschitz retractions
We proceed by constructing an example of a small convex and compact K in C[0, 1], which is contained in a small GCCR, contains a small GCCR, and yet there is no Lipschitz retraction onto it. The idea behind the construction can be described as follows. The GCCR constructed at the beginning of our note are well "aligned" with the FDD on X, and in the proof that the smallness condition of GCCR implies -property the projections are aligned with the structure of the compact. So our strategy is to employ badly complemented finite dimensional subspaces (in fact Hilbert spaces) of C[0, 1] as the sections of the sought compact K. In order to glue the decreasing sequence of these pieces together, we use the L-FDD in C[0, 1].
Lemma 5.1. For every sequence (n)nN  R+ there is a FDD in C[0, 1], (bn)nN  SC[0,1] a 2-basis and another sequence (an)  C[0, 1] satisfying the following:

COMPACT RETRACTS

25

· sup d(Pn(C[0, 1]), d(n)) <  where d(n) = dim(Pn(C[0, 1])).
nN
· ||an - bn|| < n for every n  N.
· an  (Pn - Pn-1)(C[0, 1]) for every n  N.

Proof. By Remark 5.2 of [JRZ71] there is a FDD in C[0, 1] such that

sup d(Qn(C[0, 1]), d(n)) = d < ,
nN

where the Qn are the natural projections of the FDD. Let us take (bn)nN  C[0, 1] an 2-basis, for every n  N there exists N (n)  N strictly incresing with n such that

Id - QN(n) (bn) =


(Qi - Qi-1)(bn)
i=N (n)+1

< n/2,

N (n)

so that ||en - bn|| < n/2 where en =

(Qi - Qi-1)(bn) = QN(n)(bn)

i=1

(taking Q0 = 0). We know that (bn) is weakly-null so for every k  N it

holds

that

lim
n

Qk

(bn)

=

0.

Then,

lim
n

Qk(en)

=

lim
n

Qk(en

-

bn)



lim
n

||Qk

||n

=

0,

meaning that for each k  N we can find n(k)  N strictly increasing with
k such that ||Qk(en)|| < k/2 for every n  n(k). Now we define for any kN

N (n(k))

en(k) =

(Qi - Qi-1)(en(k)) = (Id - Qk)(en(k)).

i=k+1

By induction, we define the subsequence  : N  N strictly increasing by

(1) = 1,

(p) = N (n((p - 1))) p > 1.

Given that subsequence, we are ready to define the final sequence by ak = en((k)) for each k  N. The FDD is then going to be given by the projections Pk = Q(k). It is straightforward that the first statement of the Lemma is satisfied, let us prove that the last one is also satisfied. In fact, if X = C[0, 1]
then

N (n((k)))

ak = en((k)) 

(Qi - Qi-1)(X)

i=(k)+1

= QN(n((k-1))) - Q(k-1) (X) = Q(k) - Q(k-1) (X) = (Pk - Pk-1)(X).

26

PETR HA´ JEK AND RUBE´ N MEDINA

For the second statement just see that (bn((k)))kN is a 2 basis and for every k  N
||bn((k)) - ak|| = ||bn((k)) - en((k))||
 ||bn((k)) - en((k))|| + ||en((k)) - en((k))|| < k.


We pick up   (0, 1) and a sequence (n)  R+ such that n < .
n=1
Making use of the previous Lemma we find a FDD given by the projec-
tions (Pn) and two sequences (an), (bn)  C[0, 1] satisfying the above three statements. We rename here X = C[0, 1] to make the notation cleaner.
Now we construct a subsequence  : N  N strictly increasing by in-
duction, just considering (1) = 1 and (n) = (n - 1) + n for every
n  2. Then, calling Qn = P(n) and Xn = (Qn - Qn-1)(X) we have that Yn = span({a(n-1)+1, . . . , a(n)}) is a subspace of Xn -isometric to n2 . From now on in this section we are going to denote En = Qn(X).

We define for every n  N and  > 0 the set

Bn = x  Xn : d x, BYn   .

It is clear that Bn is a compact convex subset of (1 + )BXn that generates Xn. We will need the following results to continue with the construction.

Lemma 5.2. There exists d > 0 such that for every n  N, if there is

a Lipschitz retraction  : BEn  BYn then there is a Lipschitz retraction  :   n2 satisfying the following inequality

||||Lip



3d||||Lip 1-

.

Proof. Let us denote the norm of X as || · || and let  : En  Yn be given

by (x) = ||x||

x ||x||

and (0) = 0, which is in fact a Lipschitz retraction

such that ||||Lip  3||||Lip. Denoting

Wn = span({b(n-1)+1, . . . , b(n-1)+n})  n2 ,

let S : Wn  Yn be the linear map given by S(bi) = ai for all i = (n - 1) +

(n-1)+n

1, . . . , (n - 1) + n. Then, for every x  SWn, if x =

ibi then

i=(n-1)+1

|i|  1 so

(n-1)+n

||x - S(x)|| 

|i|i  .

i=(n-1)+1

Now, for every x  Wn it holds that ||x - S(x)||  ||x|| and by the triangle inequality we have that x  Wn,

||x|| - ||S(x)||  ||x||  (1 - )||x||  ||S(x)||  (1 + )||x||,

COMPACT RETRACTS

or equivalently y  Yn, (1 - )||S-1(y)||  ||y||  (1 + )||S-1(y)||.

Let ||| · ||| : Yn  R+0 be a norm given by |||y||| = ||S-1(y)||.

The previous inequality proves that

 ||y||



|||y|||

 ||y||

y  Yn.

Also, (Yn, ||| · |||)  n2 . The retraction  : (En, || · ||)  (Yn, ||| · |||)  n2 is of norm

||||||·|||||·|||



||||||·||||·|| 1-

.

We know there is d > 0 independent of n and a norm 1 isomorphism T : (En, || · ||)  Nn such that ||T -1||  d, where Nn = dim(En). Now, we introduce the norm | · | : En  R+0 , by setting

|x| = ||T (x)||,

so that for every x  En

1 ||T -1||

||x||



|x|



||T

With that in mind, as Nn is 1-complemented in , there exists a projection P :   (En, | · |)  Nn of norm 1, but then the projection P :   (En, || · ||) is of norm
||P ||||·||||·||  d.
Now we have for every n  N that  =   P :   n2 is a lipschitz retraction such that

Lemma 5.3 (Lindenstrauss,'64). For every n  N, if  :   n2 is a Lipschitz retraction then

Proof. Just use Lemma 1.28 of [BL00] with r = n1/4 and  = 1.

Proposition 5.4. There exist two sequences (Mn), (n)  R+ the first one diverging to infinity such that for every n  N there is no Mn-Lipschitz retraction from BEn onto Bnn.

28

PETR HA´ JEK AND RUBE´ N MEDINA

Proof. It suffices to let

Mn

=

n1/4(1 - 37d

)

n  N.

Now, for a fixed n  N we are going to prove the existence of n > 0 satisfying

the statement of the Proposition by contradiction. In fact if we suppose

that for every  > 0 there exists a retraction  : BEn  Bn satisfying ||||  Mn, then, we define N : En  BEn the radial projection, and C : Bn  BYn a nearest point map. The map  = C    N : En  BYn satisfies the following inequality

||(x) - (y)||  2Mn

||x

so we are allowed to use the Proposition of [Beg99]. Then, for every  > 0 denoting  the indicator function of  BEn we have that , =    :

Let us take

a sequence (k)  R+

put k

for

every k  N. Then, if we denote k = k,k we have that k pointwise

converge to a retraction  : BEn  BYn with norm ||||Lip  4Mn. Then, by Lemma 5.2 there exists a Lipschitz retraction  :   np such that

This contradicts Lindenstrauss' Lemma 5.3.

Finally, we are ready to construct nonretractable small convex subsets of C[0, 1].

Theorem 5.5. For every sequence (n)  R+, the subset of C[0, 1] given by

K = co

nBnn

nN

is not Lipschitz retractable.

Proof. Suppose there exists a Lipschitz retraction  : C[0, 1]  K and let

||||Lip

Then,

there

that

is

of the FDD (Qn), that is, ||Qn||  M for every n  N. Now, the retraction

Rn = (Qn - Qn-1)   En : En  nBnn has norm ||Rn||Lip  2M L < Mn. Finally the retraction Fn : En  Bnn given by Fn(x) = -n 1Rn(nx)

for every x  En has norm ||Fn||Lip  ||Rn||Lip < Mn which contradicts

Proposition 5.4.

6. Nearest point map
In the final section we change our focus from the Lipschitz to uniformly continuous mappings. Due to the celebrated Lindenstrauss-Tzafriri characterization of the Hilbert space [LT71] and the Phelps [Phe58] results on the nearest point map, the Hilbert space is the only infinite dimensional Banach space such that every compact convex set is a Lipschitz retract thereof. We are left with the question whether at least uniformly continuous retractions are possible. We give a strong positive answer to this problem, showing that in fact under the URED renorming every convex and compact subset K is a uniform retract, from any bounded set K  B, by means of the nearest point map. Without loss of generality, it suffices tol deal with the case when B = BX is the unit ball of X.
Definition 6.1. Given a subset K of a Banach space X, we will say that X is K-URED if it is uniformly rotund in the direction z for every z  span(K).
Definition 6.2. Given a subset K of a Banach space X, we will say that X is K-UR if for every pair of sequences (xn), (yn)  SX such that xn - yn  K and ||xn + yn||  2 then ||xn - yn||  0.
Lemma 6.3. Let X be a Banach space uniformly rotund in the direction z  X \ {0}. If there are vn, wn  SX such that vn - wn  z, then there exist vn, wn  SX such that vn - vn, wn - wn  0 and vn - wn = nz for some n  R.
Proof. First take for every n  N
tn = max{t  0 : wn + tz  SX }.
Let us prove that tn  t  1. If we suppose that t > 1, then taking n = 1/tn we have that
wn + z = (1 - n)wn + n(wn + tnz),
where wn, wn + tnz  SX and wn - (wn + tnz) = -tnz. In particular, wn + z  BX and we have that
1  ||wn + z||  | ||vn|| - ||z - (vn - wn)|| |  1,
so by the assumption that the norm is uniformly rotund in the direction z we get that n    {0, 1} which leads to a contradiction because n = 1/tn  1/t  (0, 1). This means we can assume that t  1.

If t = 1 then we define wn = wn and vn = wn + tnz and we are done. If

t < 1 we can assume that tn < 1 for every n  N. In this case, we define

vn

=

wn+z ||wn+z||

and

sn = max{s  0 : vn + s(-z)  SX }.

Following the same argument as in the case of t, we know that s = lim sn  1.

As

t<

1

we

know

that

||wn + z||

>

1

so

wn ||wn+z||

=

vn -

z ||wn+z||

meaning

that

.

Just

notice

that

||wn + z||

because

1 < ||wn + z||  ||vn|| + ||z - (vn - wn)||  1,

so

1



s

=

lim sn



lim

1 ||wn + z||

=

s = 1.

Finally, we are able to define wn = vn + sn(-z).

Proposition 6.4. Let X be a Banach space and z  SX, the following assertions are equivalent:
· X is uniformly rotund in the direction z. · For every pair of sequences xn, yn  SX such that xn - yn  z, for
some   R, if ||xn + yn||  2 then  = 0.
Proof. If X is uniformly rotund in the direction z and we suppose the second assertion does not hold, that is, there exist xn, yn  SX such that xn - yn  z for some  = 0 with ||xn + yn||  2, then using Lemma 6.3 we get xn, yn  SX such that xn - xn, yn - yn  0 and xn - yn = nz. Now, we have
2  ||xn + yn||  ||xn + yn|| - (||xn - xn|| + ||yn - yn||)  2,
so n  0 which is impossible because nz = xn - yn  z = 0. The other implication is straightforward.

Proposition 6.5. Let X be a Banach space and K  X. Then, if K is compact, X is K-URED if and only if it is K-UR.
Proof. If X is K-URED, let us take xn, yn  SX such that xn - yn  K and ||xn + yn||  2. Then, as K is compact, xn - yn  z  K  span(K) so ||xn - yn||  0 just by Proposition 6.4. If X is K-UR then it is trivially K - U RED.

Proposition 6.6. Let X be a Banach space and K  BX a compact convex subset. If X is K - U RED then the nearest point map from BX onto K is uniformly continuous.
Proof. We are going to argue by contradiction:

If we suppose that the nearest point map R : BX  K is not uniformly continuous, then there exists an  > 0 and a pair of sequences
(xn)nN, (yn)nN  BX such that ||xn - yn||  0 and ||Rxn - Ryn|| >  for every n  N.

By compactness, we may assume that the sequences ||Rxn - xn||, ||Ryn - yn||, Rxn and Ryn are all converging. In particular, we claim that lim ||Rxn- xn|| = lim ||Ryn - yn|| = d  R+:

COMPACT RETRACTS

31

Let us first prove that lim ||Rxn - xn|| = lim ||Ryn - yn||. Otherwise, we can assume that lim ||Rxn - xn|| > lim ||Ryn - yn|| +  for some  > 0. Then there is n  N such that ||Rxn-xn|| > ||Ryn-yn||+/2 and ||xn -yn||  /2 so
||Ryn - xn||  ||Ryn - yn|| + ||xn - yn||  ||Ryn - yn|| + /2 < ||Rxn - xn||,
which is a contradiction with the definition of R. Now, if d = 0 then Rxn, xn  p  K and Ryn, yn  q  K so p = q because xn - yn  0. This means that lim ||Rxn - Ryn||  0 which is impossible, so d > 0.

We

are

going

to

use

the

previous

Lemma

with

vn

=

Rxn-xn ||Rxn-xn

||

,

wn

=

Ryn -yn ||Ryn-yn||

and

z

=

p-q d

.

Indeed,

vn

-

wn

=

Rxn ||Rxn - xn||

-

Ryn ||Ryn - yn||

+

yn||Rxn - xn|| - xn||Ryn - yn|| ||Rxn - xn|| ||Ryn - yn||

,

so

vn

- wn



z

=

p-q d

.

Let

us

then

take

vn, wn



SX

given

by

Lemma

6.3.

As

||vn + wn||  ||vn + wn|| - (||vn - vn|| + ||wn - wn||),

we have that 2  lim ||vn + wn||  lim ||vn + wn||. For this reason, in order

to prove that ||vn + wn||  2, it is enough to prove that

vn +wn 2

 1:

Equivalently, we are going to prove that

(Rxn -xn )+(Ryn -yn ) 2

 d. If

that does not hold, then there exists  > 0 such that

d = lim ||Rxn - xn|| > lim

(Rxn - xn) + (Ryn - yn) 2

+ .

Now, there has to be a n  N such that

||Rxn - xn|| >

(Rxn - xn) + (Ryn - yn) 2

+ /2

,

||xn - yn|| < ,

so taking into account the convexity of K, the next inequality is a contradiction with the definition of R:

Rxn

+ 2

Ryn

-

xn



(Rxn - xn) + (Ryn - yn) 2

+

xn

+ 2

yn

-

xn

<

(Rxn - xn) + (Ryn - yn) 2

+ /2 < ||Rxn - xn||.

Finally, we know that ||vn + wn||  2 and vn - wn = n(p - q) with n  R so, as the norm of X is K-URED, we get that n  0. This is in fact impossible because

||vn - wn||  ||vn - wn|| - (||vn - vn|| + ||wn - wn||)  ||z|| > 0.

Corollary 6.7. If X is a separable Banach space, then there is an equivalent renorming of X for which the nearest point map to a compact and convex subset of BX is uniformly continuous for every compact and convex subset of BX .
The next proof is a slight modification of the proof given by V. Zizler to renorm separable spaces with URED norm ([Ziz71]).

Proposition 6.8. For every compact subset K of a Banach space X, there is an equivalent K-URED norm on X.

Proof. Let us take V = span(K) which has to be a separable Banach space.

Now, there is a countable set {fn}nN  SX separating the points of V .

We define T : X  2 given by T x =

fn(x) 2n

.
nN

It is easily seen that T

is continuous linear and its restriction to V is injective. Our new equivalent

norm is going to be

|||x||| = ||x||2X + ||T x||22,

where || · ||X is the initial norm on X and || · ||2 is the usual norm on 2. If we suppose that there exists a bounded sequence (xn)  X such that

(6.1)

2(|||xn + z|||2 + |||xn|||2) - |||2xn + z|||2  0

for some z  V , then

2(||xn+z||2+||xn||2)-||2xn+z||2+2(||T xn+T z||22+||T xn||22)-||2T xn+T z||22  0
so in particular 2(||T xn+T z||22+||T xn||22)-||2T xn+T z||22  0, which making use of Proposition 1 of [Ziz71], equivalence 1  7 means that 2 is not uniformly rotund in the direction T z, leading to a contradiction because 2 is in fact UR. Then, (6.1) does not hold for any bounded sequence (xn)  X which again by the equivalence 1  7 means that X is uniformly rotund in the direction z.

Corollary 6.9. For every compact and convex subset K  BX of a Banach space X, there is an equivalent norm on X such that the nearest point map from BX onto K is well defined and uniformly continuous.
Corollary 6.10. For every compact and convex subset K of a Banach space X there is a uniformly continuous retraction from X onto K.
Proof. We may assume without loss of generality that K  BX. It suffices to compose the 2-Lipschitz retraction of X onto BX with the uniformly continuous retraction from BX onto K obtained earlier.

Corollary 6.11. Compact convex subsets of Banach spaces are absolute uniform retracts.
Proof. Just embed the metric space into () for some set  and use Corollary 6.10.
