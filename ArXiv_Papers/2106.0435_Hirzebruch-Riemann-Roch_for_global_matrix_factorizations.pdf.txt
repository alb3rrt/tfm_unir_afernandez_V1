HIRZEBRUCH-RIEMANN-ROCH FOR GLOBAL MATRIX FACTORIZATIONS
BUMSIG KIM
Abstract. We prove a Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch type formula for global matrix factorizations. This is established by an explicit realization of the abstract Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch type formula of Shklarov. We also show a Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch type theorem.

1. Introduction

Let k be a field of characteristic zero and let G be either the group Z

or Z{2. We consider a G-graded dg enhancement DdgpX, wq of the derived category of matrix factorizations for pX, wq. Here X is an n-dimensional

nonsingular variety over k and w is a regular function on X. An object

of DdgpX, wq is a G-graded vector bundle E on X equipped with a degree 1, OX -linear homomorphism E : E — E such that E2 " w ® idE. The structure sheaf OX is by definition G-graded but concentrated in degree 0.
The degree of w is 2. If w is nonzero, then G is forced to be Z{2. Assume that the critical locus of w is set-theoretically in w¥1p0q and proper over k.

The Hochschild homology HH∞pDdgpX, wqq of DdgpX, wq is naturally isomorphic to

H¥∞pX, p,X , ¥dwqq;

see [10, 14]. The isomorphism is called the Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg

We explain notation in the above theorem. Firstly, the operation ^ is the

wedge product inducing

(1.3)

`pPZ Hc∞pX, pX rpsq ›p›ro—j Hc0pX, nX rnsq ›t›rX— k

of the projection and the canonical trace map trX for the properly supported cohomology; see ß 3.6.2. Thirdly, _ is induced from a chain map

p,X , dwq — p,X , ¥dwq, defined by p¥1qpid : pX — pX

in each component.

For a proper dg category A there is an abstract Hirzebruch-Riemann-

Roch formula (2.5) due to Shklyarov [18]. By an explicit realization of the

formula for A " DdgpX, wq we will obtain Theorem 1.1. Let

x, ycan : HH∞pAq b HH∞pAopq — k

be the so-called canonical pairing for A. Here Aop is the opposite category of A and there is an isomorphism Aop ≠ DdgpX, ¥wq; see ß 3.1. This yields

where the left _ is defined to make the diagram commute. Shklyarov's formula says that the left-hand side of (1.1) is equal to xChpQq, ChpP q_ycan.
Therefore Theorem 1.1 is reduced to an explicit realization of the pairing.

an denotes the usual Hence Theorem 1.1

integration is the usual

and tdtoppXq is the usual Todd class Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem

[8]. When G " Z and k " C, Theorem 1.1 is the O'Brian ≠ Toledo ≠ Tong

theorem for algebraic coherent sheaves [13]. When G " Z, Theorem 1.1 and

its generalization Corollary 3.4 coincide with Theorem 4 of Markarian [12]

and some works of Caldararu ≠ Willerton [2] and Ramadoss [16], respectively.

When G " Z{2, X is an open subscheme of Ank containing the origin, and w has only one singular point at the origin, the composition of wedge products (1.2) and X in (1.3) is a residue pairing as shown in [1, Proposition 4.34]. Thus in this case, Theorem 1.1 is the Polishchuk ≠ Vaintrob theorem

[15, Theorem 4.1.4] and Theorem 1.2 is the Brown ≠ Walker theorem [1,

Theorem 1.8] proving a conjecture of Shklyarov [19, Conjecture 3].

It is natural to consider the stacky version of Theorem 1.1. It will be

treated elsewhere [3].

Conventions: Unless otherwise stated a dg category is meant to be a G-

graded dg category over k. For a variety X the sheaf pX{k of relative differential p-forms

over k, we write of X over k. For

simply pX for a homogenous

element a in a G-graded k-space, |a| denotes the degree of a. For a dg

category A we often write Apx, yq instead of the Hom complex HomApx, yq

between objects x, y of A. We write x P A if x is an object of¿A. For a dg algebra A, CpAq denotes the Hochschild G-graded complex n0 A b Ar1sbn with differential b. Similarly for a dg category A, CpAq denotes

the Hochschild complex of A; see for example [1, 18]. For ai P Apxi`1, xiq,

i " 1, ..., n, xi P A, we write a0ra1|...|ans for a0 b sa1 b ... b san, where

s is the suspension so that |sa| " |a| ¥ 1. The symbol str stands for the

supertrace. By a coherent factorization for pX, wq we mean a G-graded

coherent OX -sheaf E with a curved differential E such that E2 " w ® idE.

2. Abstract Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch
Following mainly [15, 18] we review the abstract Hirzebruch-RiemannRoch theorem in the framework of Hochschild homology theory.
2.1. Categorical Chern characters. For a G-graded dg category A over k let CpAq be the Hochschild complex of A. For x P A, the identity morphism 1x of x is a 0-cycle element and hence it defines a class
Chpxq :" r1xs P HH0pAq :" H0pCpAqq,

4

B. KIM

which is called the categorical Chern character of x. For an object y of the dg category PerfA of perfect right A-modules, we also regard Chpyq as an element of HH0pAq by the canonical isomorphism HH∞pPerfAq ≠ HH∞pAq.

2.2. Ku®nneth isomorphism. Let A, B be dg categories. We define a natural chain map over k

CpAq b CpBq — CpA b Bq a0ra1|...|ans b b0rb1|...|bms ﬁ— p¥1q|b0|pni"1p|ai|¥1qqa0 b b0 ˇ rcp1q|...|cpn`mqs,

where  runs for all pn, mq-shuffles, c1 " a1 b 1, ..., cn " an b 1, cn`1 " 1 b b1, ..., cn`m " 1 b bm, and the rule of sign  is determined by the Koszul sign rule. Here after each shuffle, each 1 is uniquely replaced by an appropriate identity morphism so that the outcomes make sense as elements of the Hochschild complex CpAbBq. The Eilenberg-Zilber theorem says that the chain map is a quasi-isomorphism. We call the induced isomorphism

HH∞pAq b HH∞pBq — HH∞pA b Bq the Ku®nneth isomorphism, denoted by Ku®nn.

2.3. The diagonal bimodule. We denote by Aop the opposite category of A. For x P A we write x_ for the object of Aop corresponding to x. Let
Comdgk be the dg category of complexes over k. The diagonal A-A-bimodule A of a dg category A is defined to be the dg functor

A : A b Aop — Comdgk; y b x_ ﬁ— HomApx, yq.

Since A b Aop ≠ pAop b Aqop, A is a right Aop b A-module. Assume that

A is proper, i.e.,

ˇ dim HipHomApx, yqq  8

iPG

for all x, y P A. Then we may replace the codomain of A by the dg category Perfk of perfect dg k-modules.

2.4. The canonical pairing. For a proper dg category A, the canonical pairing x , ycan is defined as the composition

HH∞pAq ^ HH∞pAopq ›K›u®›n—n HH∞pA b Aopq ››—∞ HH∞pPerfkq ≠ k,

where ∞ is the homomorphism in Hochschild homology level induced from the dg functor A. Here we use the canonical isomorphism HH∞pPerfkq ≠ k making a commuting diagram for C P Perfk

where ZEndpCq is the graded k-space of closed endomorphisms of C and str denotes the supertrace. Since HH∞pPerfkq " HH0pPerfkq, the pair x, 1y for  P HHppAq, 1 P HHp1pAopq can be nontrivial only when p ` p1 " 0.

2.5. A proposition. Let A be a proper dg category. Let M be a perfect right Aop b B module, in other words, a perfect A-B-bimodule. Denote by TM the dg functor
bAM : PerfA — PerfB sending N ﬁ— N bA M
and denote the induced map in Hochschild homology by

pTM q∞ : HH∞pAq — HH∞pBq.

we have

ˇ pTM q∞pq " x, tiycan ti P HHppBq.

Proof. The proof given in [18] also works for dg categories.

Furthermore assume that A is smooth, i.e, the diagonal bimodule A is perfect. Then the Hochschild homology of A is finite dimensional and hence Proposition 2.1 can be rewritten as a commuting diagram

Since TA " idA, the above diagram for M " A shows that x, ycan is non-degenerate and the canonical pairing is characterized as follows.
Since A P PerfpAop b Aq, via the Ku®nneth isomorphism we can write ˇ
ChpAq " T i b Ti, for some T i P HH∞pAopq, Ti P HH∞pAq.

Then x, ycan is a unique nondegenerate k-bilinear map x, y : HH∞pAq ^

For two closed endomorphisms b P EndApyq, a P EndApxq, we define
an endomorphism Lb  Ra of HomApx, yq by sending c P HomApx, yq to p¥1q|a||c|b  c  a. Note that ∞pb b aq " Lb  Ra. Hence from (2.3) and (2.1) we obtain

(2.4)

strpLb  Raq " xrbs, ras_ycan,

Here rbs, ras are the homology classes in HH0pAq represented by b, a, respectively.

2.8. Abstract HRR. When a " 1x, b " 1y, (2.4) yields the abstract

Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem [15, 18] for Hochschild homology:

(2.5)

ˇ p¥1qi dim HipHomApx, yqqq " xChpyq, Chpxq_ycan.

iPG

This tautological HRR theorem can be useful when one expresses the right-

hand side of (2.5) in an explicit form.

3. Proofs of Theorems
In this section we prove Theorems 1.1 and 1.2. As in ß 1 let X be an n-dimensional nonsingular variety over k and w is a function on X such that the critical locus of w is in w¥1p0q and proper over k.
3.1. A geometric realization of A. Let A " DdgpX, wq. It is proper and smooth. There is the duality functor
D : Aop — DdgpX, ¥wq; pE, E q ﬁ— pHomOX pE, OX q, E_q,
which is an isomorphism. Hence we have the HKR type isomorphism HH∞pAopq ≠ H¥∞p,X , dwq.
Let X1 be another nonsingular variety with a global function w1. Assume that the critical locus of w1 is proper over k and located on the zero locus of w1. Let B denote DdgpX1, w1q. Let wr :" w b 1 ¥ 1 b w1 a global function on Z :" X ^ X1. We consider a dg functor
 : DdgpZ, ¥wrq — PerfpAop b Bq
defined by letting
pzq : A b Bop — Comdgpkq; y b x_ ﬁ— HomDdgpZ,¥wrqpDpyq b x, zq

HIRZEBRUCH-RIEMANN-ROCH FOR GLOBAL MATRIX FACTORIZATIONS 7

for y P A, x P B, z P DdgpZ, ¥wrq. Since Aop b B are saturated by [10], we
may apply Proposition 3.4 of [17] to see that pzq is indeed a perfect right Aop b B-module.
Let f : X — X1 be a proper morphism such that f ∞w1 " w. Then there

is a dg functor

Rf∞ : DdgpX, wq — DdgpX1, w1q

by derived pushforward; see [5, ß 2.2]. Define

Rf∞ : A b Bop — Comdgk; y b x_ — HomBpx, Rf∞yq.

Again by Proposition 3.4 of [17], we see that Rf∞ is a perfect right Aop b Bmodule. Let f  X ^ X1 denote the graph of f . Since Z " X ^ X1 is nonsingular, there is an object Owrf in DdgpZ, ¥wrq which is quasi-isomorphic to the coherent factorization Of for pZ, wrq. Since

by the projection formula [5, ß 2.2], Rf∞ and pOwrf q are isomorphic in the
derived category of right Aop bB-modules. Hence ChpRf∞q " ChppOwrf qq. Consider a dg functor

b : Aop b B — DdgpZ, ¥wrq; u_ b v ﬁ— Dpuq b v. The following commutative diagram of natural isomorphisms transforms the abstract terms to the concrete terms:

The commutativity of the triangle is straightforward. The commutativity of the rectangle can be seen as follows. Using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence argument, we reduce it to the case when X and X1 are affine. We further reduce it to the curved smooth algebra case. In the curved smooth algebra case, the commutativity of a corresponding diagram for Hochschild complexes of the second kind is straightforward; see for example [4].
We conclude that

(3.2)

chpRf∞q " chpOwrf q P H0p,Z , dwrq

by the compatibility of the Ku®nneth isomorphisms and the HKR type isomorphisms in (3.1). In particular for f " idX we have

cohomology.

Definition 3.2. Let wi P pX, OX q, i " 1, 2 and let Zi be the critical locus of wi. The wedge product ^ of twisted Hodge cohomology classes is defined by the composition of

to show that x, y satisfies (2.2) under the HKR-type isomorphism in (3.1).

Since  and  are cycle classes of CpAq, they can be considered as elements of HH∞pAq. We denote by  pq,  pq be the image of ,  under the HKR map. The map  is sometimes called the boundary-bulk map. Combining (2.4) and Theorem 1.2 we obtain this.

3.6. Pushforward in Hodge cohomology. We collect some properties of pushforwards in Hodge cohomology that are used in ß 3.3. For lack of a suitable reference we provide their proofs.
Throughout this subsection f : X — Y will be a morphism between varieties X, Y with dimensions n, m respectively. Let d " n ¥ m.

3.6.1. Definition of f∞. Suppose that f is a proper locally complete intersection (l.c.i) morphism. Let E be a perfect complex on Y . Denote by
f : Rf∞f !E — E

HIRZEBRUCH-RIEMANN-ROCH FOR GLOBAL MATRIX FACTORIZATIONS 13

the duality map in the derived category Dq`cpOY q of cohomologically bounded below quasi-coherent sheaves; see for example [11, ß 4]. Since f is l.c.i, f !OY
is taken to be an invertible sheaf up to shift and there is a canonical isomorphism Lf ∞E b f !OY ≠ f !E. For q P Z, let  P HqpX, f !Eq, which can be considered as a map  : OX r¥qs — f !E in the derived category. We have a
composition of maps

OY r¥qs ›n›a›tu›r›a—l Rf∞f ∞OY r¥qs ›R›f›∞›p—q Rf∞f !E ›—f E,

denoted by f∞pq. This yields a homomorphism

f∞ : HqpX, f !Eq — HqpY, Eq.

Let g : Y — Z be a proper l.c.i. morphism between varieties. The uniqueness of adjunction implies the functoriality of the pushforward

3.6.2. Definitions of f and X . Let f : X — Y be a morphism between

nonsingular varieties. For p  0 with p ¥ d  0 we have a natural homo-

morphism

We define Hodge cohomology with proper supports along f as the direct

limit:

Hcqf pX,

pX q,

where Z runs over all closed subvarieties of X that are proper over Y .

By Nagata's compactification and the resolution of singularities there is a nonsingular variety XØ including X as an open subvariety and a proper morphism fØ : XØ — Y extending f . Recall the fact that if Z is a closed subvariety of X that is proper over Y , then Z is a closed subvariety of XØ .

Let

nat : H6q1 pX, pX q — H6q2 pXØ , pXØ q

be the natural map where p61, 62q is either pc, cq or pcf, Hq. We define the

pushforward (for p  0 with p ¥ d  0) 

(3.11)

Using the functoriality (3.10), we note that f is independent of the choices

of XØ , an open immersion X „— XØ , and an extension fØ. When Y " Speck,

we also write X for f

If v : X1 — X be a proper morphism between nonsingular varieties, we have the natural pullback map
v∞ : HcqpX, pX q — HcqpX1, pX1 q.

Assume that f is a flat, proper, l.c.i morphism. Then from the base change

Proof. By Nagata's compactification f is extendible to a proper flat morphism fØ : XØ — Y with an open immersion X „— XØ . By the resolution of singularities we can make that XØ is nonsingular and the closure XØ1 of X1 in XØ is also nonsingular. Let vØ : fØ¥1pY 1q — XØ be the induced morphism and let vØ :" vØ|XØ1 .
