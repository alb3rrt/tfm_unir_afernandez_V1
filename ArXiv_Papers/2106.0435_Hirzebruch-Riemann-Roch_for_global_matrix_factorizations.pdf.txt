HIRZEBRUCH-RIEMANN-ROCH FOR GLOBAL MATRIX FACTORIZATIONS
BUMSIG KIM
Abstract. We prove a Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch type formula for global matrix factorizations. This is established by an explicit realization of the abstract Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch type formula of Shklarov. We also show a Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch type theorem.

1. Introduction

Let k be a field of characteristic zero and let G be either the group Z

or Z{2. We consider a G-graded dg enhancement DdgpX, wq of the derived category of matrix factorizations for pX, wq. Here X is an n-dimensional

nonsingular variety over k and w is a regular function on X. An object

of DdgpX, wq is a G-graded vector bundle E on X equipped with a degree 1, OX -linear homomorphism E : E Ñ E such that E2 " w ¨ idE. The structure sheaf OX is by definition G-graded but concentrated in degree 0.
The degree of w is 2. If w is nonzero, then G is forced to be Z{2. Assume that the critical locus of w is set-theoretically in w´1p0q and proper over k.

The Hochschild homology HH°pDdgpX, wqq of DdgpX, wq is naturally isomorphic to

H´°pX, p,X , ´dwqq;

see [10, 14]. The isomorphism is called the Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg

Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch type formula.

We explain notation in the above theorem. Firstly, the operation ^ is the

wedge product inducing

H°pX, p,X , ´dwqqbH°pX, p,X , dwqqbH°pX, p,X , 0qq ÝwÝeÝdÝgÑe `pHc°pX, pX rpsq; see 3.2 for details. Secondly, X is the composition

(1.3)

`pPZ Hc°pX, pX rpsq ÝpÝroÑj Hc0pX, nX rnsq ÝtÝrXÑ k

of the projection and the canonical trace map trX for the properly supported cohomology; see § 3.6.2. Thirdly, _ is induced from a chain map

p,X , dwq Ñ p,X , ´dwq, defined by p´1qpid : pX Ñ pX

in each component.

For a proper dg category A there is an abstract Hirzebruch-Riemann-

Roch formula (2.5) due to Shklyarov [18]. By an explicit realization of the

formula for A " DdgpX, wq we will obtain Theorem 1.1. Let

x, ycan : HH°pAq b HH°pAopq Ñ k

be the so-called canonical pairing for A. Here Aop is the opposite category of A and there is an isomorphism Aop ­ DdgpX, ´wq; see § 3.1. This yields

where the left _ is defined to make the diagram commute. Shklyarov's formula says that the left-hand side of (1.1) is equal to xChpQq, ChpP q_ycan.
Therefore Theorem 1.1 is reduced to an explicit realization of the pairing.

projective variety over C, there is a natural isomorphism between Hodge co-

an denotes the usual Hence Theorem 1.1

integration is the usual

and tdtoppXq is the usual Todd class Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem

[8]. When G " Z and k " C, Theorem 1.1 is the O'Brian ­ Toledo ­ Tong

theorem for algebraic coherent sheaves [13]. When G " Z, Theorem 1.1 and

its generalization Corollary 3.4 coincide with Theorem 4 of Markarian [12]

and some works of Caldararu ­ Willerton [2] and Ramadoss [16], respectively.

When G " Z{2, X is an open subscheme of Ank containing the origin, and w has only one singular point at the origin, the composition of wedge products (1.2) and X in (1.3) is a residue pairing as shown in [1, Proposition 4.34]. Thus in this case, Theorem 1.1 is the Polishchuk ­ Vaintrob theorem

[15, Theorem 4.1.4] and Theorem 1.2 is the Brown ­ Walker theorem [1,

Theorem 1.8] proving a conjecture of Shklyarov [19, Conjecture 3].

It is natural to consider the stacky version of Theorem 1.1. It will be

treated elsewhere [3].

Conventions: Unless otherwise stated a dg category is meant to be a G-

graded dg category over k. For a variety X the sheaf pX{k of relative differential p-forms

over k, we write of X over k. For

simply pX for a homogenous

element a in a G-graded k-space, |a| denotes the degree of a. For a dg

category A we often write Apx, yq instead of the Hom complex HomApx, yq

between objects x, y of A. We write x P A if x is an object ofÀA. For a dg algebra A, CpAq denotes the Hochschild G-graded complex n0 A b Ar1sbn with differential b. Similarly for a dg category A, CpAq denotes

the Hochschild complex of A; see for example [1, 18]. For ai P Apxi`1, xiq,

i " 1, ..., n, xi P A, we write a0ra1|...|ans for a0 b sa1 b ... b san, where

s is the suspension so that |sa| " |a| ´ 1. The symbol str stands for the

supertrace. By a coherent factorization for pX, wq we mean a G-graded

coherent OX -sheaf E with a curved differential E such that E2 " w ¨ idE.

2. Abstract Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch
Following mainly [15, 18] we review the abstract Hirzebruch-RiemannRoch theorem in the framework of Hochschild homology theory.
2.1. Categorical Chern characters. For a G-graded dg category A over k let CpAq be the Hochschild complex of A. For x P A, the identity morphism 1x of x is a 0-cycle element and hence it defines a class
Chpxq :" r1xs P HH0pAq :" H0pCpAqq,

4

B. KIM

which is called the categorical Chern character of x. For an object y of the dg category PerfA of perfect right A-modules, we also regard Chpyq as an element of HH0pAq by the canonical isomorphism HH°pPerfAq ­ HH°pAq.

2.2. Ku¨nneth isomorphism. Let A, B be dg categories. We define a natural chain map over k

CpAq b CpBq Ñ CpA b Bq a0ra1|...|ans b b0rb1|...|bms ÞÑ p´1q|b0|pni"1p|ai|´1qqa0 b b0 ÿ rcp1q|...|cpn`mqs,

where  runs for all pn, mq-shuffles, c1 " a1 b 1, ..., cn " an b 1, cn`1 " 1 b b1, ..., cn`m " 1 b bm, and the rule of sign  is determined by the Koszul sign rule. Here after each shuffle, each 1 is uniquely replaced by an appropriate identity morphism so that the outcomes make sense as elements of the Hochschild complex CpAbBq. The Eilenberg-Zilber theorem says that the chain map is a quasi-isomorphism. We call the induced isomorphism

HH°pAq b HH°pBq Ñ HH°pA b Bq the Ku¨nneth isomorphism, denoted by Ku¨nn.

2.3. The diagonal bimodule. We denote by Aop the opposite category of A. For x P A we write x_ for the object of Aop corresponding to x. Let
Comdgk be the dg category of complexes over k. The diagonal A-A-bimodule A of a dg category A is defined to be the dg functor

A : A b Aop Ñ Comdgk; y b x_ ÞÑ HomApx, yq.

Since A b Aop ­ pAop b Aqop, A is a right Aop b A-module. Assume that

A is proper, i.e.,

ÿ dim HipHomApx, yqq  8

iPG

for all x, y P A. Then we may replace the codomain of A by the dg category Perfk of perfect dg k-modules.

2.4. The canonical pairing. For a proper dg category A, the canonical pairing x , ycan is defined as the composition

HH°pAq ^ HH°pAopq ÝKÝu¨ÝnÑn HH°pA b Aopq ÝÝÑ° HH°pPerfkq ­ k,

where ° is the homomorphism in Hochschild homology level induced from the dg functor A. Here we use the canonical isomorphism HH°pPerfkq ­ k making a commuting diagram for C P Perfk

where ZEndpCq is the graded k-space of closed endomorphisms of C and str denotes the supertrace. Since HH°pPerfkq " HH0pPerfkq, the pair x, 1y for  P HHppAq, 1 P HHp1pAopq can be nontrivial only when p ` p1 " 0.

2.5. A proposition. Let A be a proper dg category. Let M be a perfect right Aop b B module, in other words, a perfect A-B-bimodule. Denote by TM the dg functor
bAM : PerfA Ñ PerfB sending N ÞÑ N bA M
and denote the induced map in Hochschild homology by

pTM q° : HH°pAq Ñ HH°pBq.

P

HH°pAopqbHH°pBq ­ HH°pAopbBq ­ H°pPerfpAopbBqq via the Ku¨nneth

isomorphism and the canonical isomorphism, then for every  P HHppAq

we have

ÿ pTM q°pq " x, tiycan ti P HHppBq.

i

Proof. The proof given in [18] also works for dg categories.

Furthermore assume that A is smooth, i.e, the diagonal bimodule A is perfect. Then the Hochschild homology of A is finite dimensional and hence Proposition 2.1 can be rewritten as a commuting diagram

HH°pAq x,ycan/ HH°pAopq°

Since TA " idA, the above diagram for M " A shows that x, ycan is non-degenerate and the canonical pairing is characterized as follows.
Since A P PerfpAop b Aq, via the Ku¨nneth isomorphism we can write ÿ
ChpAq " T i b Ti, for some T i P HH°pAopq, Ti P HH°pAq.
i

Then x, ycan is a unique nondegenerate k-bilinear map x, y : HH°pAq ^

HH°pAÿopq Ñ k satisfying

Remark 2.2. Using the quasi-Yoneda embedding and the HKR-type isomorphism it is straightforward to check that the chain map _ in § 2.6 fits in diagram (1.4); see for example [4].

For two closed endomorphisms b P EndApyq, a P EndApxq, we define
an endomorphism Lb  Ra of HomApx, yq by sending c P HomApx, yq to p´1q|a||c|b  c  a. Note that °pb b aq " Lb  Ra. Hence from (2.3) and (2.1) we obtain

(2.4)

strpLb  Raq " xrbs, ras_ycan,

Here rbs, ras are the homology classes in HH0pAq represented by b, a, respectively.

2.8. Abstract HRR. When a " 1x, b " 1y, (2.4) yields the abstract

Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem [15, 18] for Hochschild homology:

(2.5)

ÿ p´1qi dim HipHomApx, yqqq " xChpyq, Chpxq_ycan.

iPG

This tautological HRR theorem can be useful when one expresses the right-

hand side of (2.5) in an explicit form.

3. Proofs of Theorems
In this section we prove Theorems 1.1 and 1.2. As in § 1 let X be an n-dimensional nonsingular variety over k and w is a function on X such that the critical locus of w is in w´1p0q and proper over k.
3.1. A geometric realization of A. Let A " DdgpX, wq. It is proper and smooth. There is the duality functor
D : Aop Ñ DdgpX, ´wq; pE, E q ÞÑ pHomOX pE, OX q, E_q,
which is an isomorphism. Hence we have the HKR type isomorphism HH°pAopq ­ H´°p,X , dwq.
Let X1 be another nonsingular variety with a global function w1. Assume that the critical locus of w1 is proper over k and located on the zero locus of w1. Let B denote DdgpX1, w1q. Let wr :" w b 1 ´ 1 b w1 a global function on Z :" X ^ X1. We consider a dg functor
 : DdgpZ, ´wrq Ñ PerfpAop b Bq
defined by letting
pzq : A b Bop Ñ Comdgpkq; y b x_ ÞÑ HomDdgpZ,´wrqpDpyq b x, zq

HIRZEBRUCH-RIEMANN-ROCH FOR GLOBAL MATRIX FACTORIZATIONS 7

for y P A, x P B, z P DdgpZ, ´wrq. Since Aop b B are saturated by [10], we
may apply Proposition 3.4 of [17] to see that pzq is indeed a perfect right Aop b B-module.
Let f : X Ñ X1 be a proper morphism such that f °w1 " w. Then there

is a dg functor

Rf° : DdgpX, wq Ñ DdgpX1, w1q

by derived pushforward; see [5, § 2.2]. Define

Rf° : A b Bop Ñ Comdgk; y b x_ Ñ HomBpx, Rf°yq.

Again by Proposition 3.4 of [17], we see that Rf° is a perfect right Aop b Bmodule. Let f  X ^ X1 denote the graph of f . Since Z " X ^ X1 is nonsingular, there is an object Owrf in DdgpZ, ´wrq which is quasi-isomorphic to the coherent factorization Of for pZ, wrq. Since

by the projection formula [5, § 2.2], Rf° and pOwrf q are isomorphic in the
derived category of right Aop bB-modules. Hence ChpRf°q " ChppOwrf qq. Consider a dg functor

b : Aop b B Ñ DdgpZ, ´wrq; u_ b v ÞÑ Dpuq b v. The following commutative diagram of natural isomorphisms transforms the abstract terms to the concrete terms:

The commutativity of the triangle is straightforward. The commutativity of the rectangle can be seen as follows. Using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence argument, we reduce it to the case when X and X1 are affine. We further reduce it to the curved smooth algebra case. In the curved smooth algebra case, the commutativity of a corresponding diagram for Hochschild complexes of the second kind is straightforward; see for example [4].
We conclude that

(3.2)

chpRf°q " chpOwrf q P H0p,Z , dwrq

by the compatibility of the Ku¨nneth isomorphisms and the HKR type isomorphisms in (3.1). In particular for f " idX we have

to show that x, y satisfies (2.2) under the HKR-type isomorphism in (3.1).

3.4. Proof of Theorem 1.1. For  P `iPGRiEndpP q and  P `iPGRiEndpQq, let us define

Since  and  are cycle classes of CpAq, they can be considered as elements of HH°pAq. We denote by  pq,  pq be the image of ,  under the HKR map. The map  is sometimes called the boundary-bulk map. Combining (2.4) and Theorem 1.2 we obtain this.

3.6. Pushforward in Hodge cohomology. We collect some properties of pushforwards in Hodge cohomology that are used in § 3.3. For lack of a suitable reference we provide their proofs.
Throughout this subsection f : X Ñ Y will be a morphism between varieties X, Y with dimensions n, m respectively. Let d " n ´ m.

3.6.1. Definition of f°. Suppose that f is a proper locally complete intersection (l.c.i) morphism. Let E be a perfect complex on Y . Denote by
f : Rf°f !E Ñ E

HIRZEBRUCH-RIEMANN-ROCH FOR GLOBAL MATRIX FACTORIZATIONS 13

the duality map in the derived category Dq`cpOY q of cohomologically bounded below quasi-coherent sheaves; see for example [11, § 4]. Since f is l.c.i, f !OY
is taken to be an invertible sheaf up to shift and there is a canonical isomorphism Lf °E b f !OY ­ f !E. For q P Z, let  P HqpX, f !Eq, which can be considered as a map  : OX r´qs Ñ f !E in the derived category. We have a
composition of maps

OY r´qs ÝnÝaÝtuÝrÝaÑl Rf°f °OY r´qs ÝRÝfÝ°ÝpÑq Rf°f !E ÝÑf E,

denoted by f°pq. This yields a homomorphism

f° : HqpX, f !Eq Ñ HqpY, Eq.

Let g : Y Ñ Z be a proper l.c.i. morphism between varieties. The uniqueness of adjunction implies the functoriality of the pushforward

3.6.2. Definitions of f and X . Let f : X Ñ Y be a morphism between

nonsingular varieties. For p  0 with p ´ d  0 we have a natural homo-

morphism

pX rqs ­ n´p TX rqs b f °mY r´ds b f !OY

n´p ÝÑ f °TY rqs b f °mY r´ds b f !OY

­ f °pY´drq ´ ds b f !OY .

denoted by Tf .

We define Hodge cohomology with proper supports along f as the direct

limit:

Hcqf pX,

pX q

HZq pX,

pX q,

where Z runs over all closed subvarieties of X that are proper over Y .

By Nagata's compactification and the resolution of singularities there is a nonsingular variety X¯ including X as an open subvariety and a proper morphism f¯ : X¯ Ñ Y extending f . Recall the fact that if Z is a closed subvariety of X that is proper over Y , then Z is a closed subvariety of X¯ .

Let

nat : H6q1 pX, pX q Ñ H6q2 pX¯ , pX¯ q

be the natural map where p61, 62q is either pc, cq or pcf, Hq. We define the

pushforward (for p  0 with p ´ d  0) 

(3.11)

: H6q1 pX, pX q Ñ H6q2´dpY, pY´dq;  ÞÑ f¯°pTf pnatpqqq.

Using the functoriality (3.10), we note that f is independent of the choices

of X¯ , an open immersion X ãÑ X¯ , and an extension f¯. When Y " Speck,

we also write X for f

If v : X1 Ñ X be a proper morphism between nonsingular varieties, we have the natural pullback map
v° : HcqpX, pX q Ñ HcqpX1, pX1 q.

Assume that f is a flat, proper, l.c.i morphism. Then from the base change

a closed point of Y . Then for  P HcdpX, dX q we easily check that

Proof. By Nagata's compactification f is extendible to a proper flat morphism f¯ : X¯ Ñ Y with an open immersion X ãÑ X¯ . By the resolution of singularities we can make that X¯ is nonsingular and the closure X¯1 of X1 in X¯ is also nonsingular. Let v¯ : f¯´1pY 1q Ñ X¯ be the induced morphism and let v¯ :" v¯|X¯1 .

may identify Op´1q with the i-th component of OP`nn`1 by the tautological

monomorphism Op´1q Ñ OP`nn`1. This yields connections i on Op´1q|Ui .
