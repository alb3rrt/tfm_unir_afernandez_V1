Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) constitute passive devices, which are capable of adjusting the phase shifts of their reflected signals, and hence they are suitable for passive beamforming. In this paper, we conceive their design with the active beamforming action of multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) systems used at the access points (APs) for improving the beamforming gain, where both the APs and users are equipped with multiple antennas. Firstly, we decouple the optimization problem and design the active beamforming for a given IRS configuration. Then we transform the optimization problem of the IRS-based passive beamforming design into a tractable non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). For solving the transformed problem, we give an approximate solution based on the technique of widely used semidefinite relaxation (SDR). We also propose a low-complexity iterative solution. We further prove that it can converge to a locally optimal value. Finally, considering the practical scenario of discrete phase shifts at the IRS, we give the quantization design for IRS elements on basis of the two solutions. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solutions over the relevant benchmarks. Keywords: Intelligent reflecting surface; MIMO systems; passive beamforming

I. INTRODUCTION
The fifth-generation (5G) and beyond wireless networks have a 1000-time increasing demand for network capacity. To achieve this goal, a variety of techniques have been proposed, including millimeter-wave communications, massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) and ultra-dense networks [1]. However, the concomitant increased energy consumption and hardware cost imposed by active devices such as antennas and radio frequency (RF) chains still make these techniques challenging for practical implementation at high frequency. Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) based techniques are capable of further enhancing the system's performance at a low hardware complexity and power consumption [2­4]. IRS-assisted MIMO systems rely on passive elements for reflecting the incident signals with a particular phase shift [5­7]. The joint design of the active baseband beamforming and passive IRS-assisted beamforming has a substantial further promise.
1.1 Literature Review
Researchers have designed active and passive beamforming for a variety of IRS-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, where a single data stream supported by a single-antenna user. Specifically, Wu and Zhang [5] propose to minimize the total transmit power by applying semidefinite relaxation and alternating optimization techniques. They also

considered realistic discrete phase shifts at the IRS [8], where they propose an optimal solution based on the popular branch-and-bound method as well as a suboptimal iterative solution. Guo et al. [9] propose to maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR) of a multiuser MISO (MU-MISO) system by relying on a fractional programming technique and on the non-convex block coordinate descent (BCD) method, where both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) are considered. Pan et al. [10] propose to maximize the WSR of IRS-assisted MISO broadcast systems. They adopt the classic BCD algorithm for partitioning the original optimization problem into several subproblems and then solving them alternatively. Nadeem et al. [11] propose to maximize the minimum signal-tointerference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) through optimal linear precoder (OLP) for the cases where the channel matrix between the BS and the IRS is of rank-one and of full-rank. Furthermore, Li et al. [12] investigate the beamforming design in wideband MISO systems for maximizing the average sum-rate over all subcarriers of MU-MISO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems by iteratively designing the actions of the IRS elements on basis of mean square error minimization. Zhang et al. [13] derive a closedform solution for beamforming in IRS assisted singleuser MISO (SU-MISO) systems, where the statistical reflected channels is considered. Wang et al. [14] propose a joint design of active and passive precoding design algorithm for IRS assisted millimeter wave (mmWave) MISO systems, where multiple IRSs are deployed to assist the data transmission.
Different from the above mentioned IRS-assisted MISO systems, some researchers have also studied the joint active and passive beamforming design for the MIMO systems, where multiple antennas are equipped at both the AP and the user. The beamforming design for IRS-assisted MIMO systems is more challenging since IRS elements and the baseband beamforming need to be properly configured for improving the system performance with multiple spatial data streams. Pan et al. [15] focus on multicell MIMO communication systems. They deal with the intercell interference and propose to maximize the WSR of all users by jointly optimizing the active precoding matrices at the BS and the phase shifts at the IRS. However, this method is too complicated for practical implementation. Wang et al. [16] aim to maximize

the spectrum efficiency by jointly optimizing the IRS and the hybrid precoder (combiner) at the BS (user) in IRS-assisted mmWave MIMO systems. Joint active precoding and passive beamforming optimization is an important problem for the implemention of IRSassisted SU-MIMO system. However, it remains nonconvex and thus is hard to be solved optimally. Regarding this, Ning et al. [17] first propose to reformulate it into a relaxed problem of maximizing sum-path gains, which can be effectively solved by ADMM. Then, Zhang et al. [18] provide a more strict reformulation and proposed an alternating optimization (AO)based algorithm to obtain a high-performance solution to this problem. However, the computional complexity of the AO-based solution is quite high when the number of AP or IRS antenna elements is large.
1.2 Contributions
Against this background, our main contributions are as follows:
· In this paper, we focus on an IRS-assisted SUMIMO system, where a multi-antenna access point (AP) serves a multi-antenna user with the aid of an IRS. We propose to maximize the spectrum efficiency of IRS-assisted MIMO systems, by designing the active beamforming at the AP and the passive beamforming at the IRS. Specifically, we decouple the optimization problem and derive the optimal baseband beamforming design for a given IRS configuration. Based on the relaxed problem given in [17], the passive beamforming design problem is formulated as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), subject to the constant modulus constraints imposed by IRS elements.
· To tackle the non-convexity of the passive beamforming design problem considered, we first give an approximate solution based on the technique of widely used semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Furthermore, we derive the relationship between the objective function and each IRS element. Then we proprose a different solution, i.e., iterative solution, to obtain a higher-quality solution compared to ADMM-based solution. This solution, albeit yielding lower performance than AO-based solution, is appealing on account of its low conputational complexity. We also demonstrate the

convergence of the iterative solution. Specifically, during the iterations, the objective function (OF) of the transformed problem is monotonically increasing, which is proved to be upper bounded by a mathematically derived value. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed iterative solution.
· We further consider a practical scenario, where the phase shifts of IRS elements are selected from the discrete phase set. We propose a pair of quantization design procedures for achieving this goal on basis of the two solutions. For SDR-base solution, we directly quantize the derived phase shifts according to the number of quantization bits. Moreover, we propose a iterative quantization method corresponding to the iteration solution.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, our system and channel models are introduced. In Section III, our problem formulation are presented. In Section IV, we propose our passive beamforming for IRS-assisted MIMO systems. In Section V, numerical results are provided. Finally, our conclusions are drawn in Section VI.

II. SYSTEM AND CHANNEL MODEL
In this section, we will introduce the system model and channel model of our IRS-assisted MIMO system.
2.1 System Model
We consider the point-to-point MIMO system of figure 1, where an AP equipped with Nt transmit antennas (TAs) transmits Ns data streams to a user having Nr receive antennas (RAs) (Ns = Nr  Nt). For improving the beamforming gain during the transmission, an IRS consisting of M passive elements is in-

stalled. We define the baseband transmit signals as s = [s1, s2, · · · , sNs ]T  CNs×1, which satisfy E ssH = INs. The AP uses baseband beamforming defined by the active beamforming matrix W  CNt×Ns. Then,
the AP transmits the precoded signals Ws to the user
through both the direct link and the reflected link.
The channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be
known at the AP [5]. The direct link between the AP and the user is denoted by HHd  CNr×Nt. The reflected link is composed of three components, which are the AP-IRS channel G  CM×Nt, IRS-induced phase shifts  = diag (v)  CM×M and the IRSuser channel HHr  CNr×M . The signals reflected by the IRS once are considered while those reflected by
IRS for two and more times are ignored [17]. Then, the signals y  CNr×1 received at the user can be ex-
pressed as

where  denotes the transmit power and n  CN 0, 2I  CNs×1 represents the additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) at the user.

2.2 Channel Model
The direct link is modeled by the Rayleigh fading channel [5]

Hd = L0 (d0) Hd,

and the reflected links are characterized by the Rician fading model, which can be expressed by [19, 13]

We further introduce the LoS components under the assumption that the AP, the IRS and the user are equipped with uniform planar arrays (UPAs). The UPA departure/arrival steering vector is given by

where  and  denote the azimuth and elevation angle of departure/arrival (AoD/AoA) of the signals,  is the wavelength, while d is the distance between the adjacent antenna elements. The variables m  {0, 1, · · · , W - 1} and n  {0, 1, · · · , H - 1} associated with W and H denote the number of antennas in the horizontal and vertical directions. Then we can express Hr and G as

Hr = a (r1, 1r) aH t1, 1t ,

G = a (r2, 2r) aH t2, 2t ,

(7)

where a (r0, 0r), a (r1, 1r) and a (r2, 2r) denote the arrival steering vectors, and a (t0, 0t ), a (t1, 1t ) and a (t2, 2t ) represent the departure steering vectors.

The problem (P1) is a non-convex one subject to the constant-modulus constraint of IRS elements. Following the conclusions of [21], we approximately transform the problem (P1) under the high-SNR assumption as

According to the problem (P2), we have to design both the active beamforming W and the phase shifts  for maximizing the spectrum efficiency. Observe in (9a) that W and  are coupled in the OF. For decoupling the two variables, we adopt the optimal baseband beamforming matrix for a given IRS configuration  as Wopt = Veff[:,1:Ns] [22, 23] where Heff = HHr G + HHd is the effective channel and Veff consists of the right singular vectors of Heff .
Then, upon adopting the near-optimal baseband beamforming matrix, we further transform (9a) under

s.t. |m,m| = 1, m = 1, 2, · · · , M. (11b)

Afterwards, we characterize the OF (11a) in another form for decoupling the IRS elements from the channel matrices. Specifically, we rewrite (11a) as

HHr G + HHd

2 F

= vecH HHr G + HHd vec HHr G + HHd .

(12)

By adopting the essential equation vec (ABC) = CT  A vec (B), we can further rewrite (12) as

vecH HHr G + HHd vec HHr G + HHd

= vecH () GT  HHr H GT  HHr vec ()

+ vecH () GT  HHr H vec HHd

+ vecH HHd GT  HHr vec ()

+ vecH HHd vec HHd .

(13)

Then we simplify the expression (13). The vector

vec () can be equivalently expressed by vec () =



H 1



H 2

···

HM H, where m = ejmIM[:,m]. We

observe that there are M (M - 1) zero elements in

vec () and we define the location set of the nonzero

elements as Mnz. Then we can further reduce the sizes of vectors and matrices in (13). We de-

fine the coupled reflected channel matrix as Gc = GT  HHr [:,jMnz] and the vectorized direct channel matrix as hv = vec HHd . It may be observed that the constant term hHv hv is not related to the IRS elements, which can be ignored. Thus, recalling v defined in
Section 2.1, we can equivalently transform the prob-

lem (P3) as

Note that although the problem (P4) is in the form of a well-known non-convex QCQP, the problem transformation from the (P1) to (P4) is specific for IRSassisted MIMO systems. In the next section, we will give an approximate SDR-based solution and propose a low-complexity iterative solution.

IV. PASSIVE BEAMFORMING FOR IRSASSISTED MIMO SYSTEMS
In this section, we will first give an approximate solution for the problem (P4) based on SDR. Then, we further propose a low-complexity iterative solution for approaching the optimal spectrum efficiency.

4.1 SDR-based Solution
By introducing an auxiliary variable t, the problem (P4) can be reformulated as a homogeneous QCQP [5, 19], which can be expressed as

(P5) :

where ~v =

,R=

GHc hv . We define 0

V = ~v~Hv , which satisfies V 0 and rank (V) =

1. Then we utilize the SDR for relaxing the rank-one

constraint and transform the problem (P5) as

~v

(16a)

s.t. Vm,m = 1, m = 1, 2, · · · , M + 1,

(16b)

(16c)

We observe that the problem (P6) is a standard convex semidefinite program (SDP), hence we can solve it by existing convex optimization solvers such as CVX for acquiring the optimal solution [24]. Due to the fact that the solution may not satisfy the rank-one constraint, the following Gaussian randomization procedure is adopted for producing a high-quality rankone solution [25]. Specifically, we first derive the eigenvalue decomposition of V as V = UssUHs . Then we obtain the modified solution to (P5) as ~v =
1
Uss2 r. The vector r  CN (0, IM+1)  C(M+1)×1 is selected from a large number of random generalized CSCG vectors for maximizing the OF value of (P5). Finally, the solution to problem (P4) is acquired by v = e ( ), j arg ~v[1:M]/~v[M+1] which satisfies the constant-modulus constraint.
We summarize the SDR-based solution in Algorithm 1. Specifically, the CVX solution acquired in step 1 is followed by Gaussian randomization procedure in step 2. The final solution is obtained in step 3.

4.2 Iterative Solution
For mitigating the complexity of the SDR-based solution, we now propose a low-complexity iterative solution. Specifically, we first equivalently transform the problem (P4) as

(P7) :

s.t. v,m = 1, m = 1, 2, · · · , M + 1,

(17b)

where v =

v . We propose to design the phase 1

shifts of the IRS elements in a one-by-one manner dur-

ing the iterations. In order to update the phase shifts,

we decompose the OF (17a) into an element-wise form

as

where (a) holds due to the fact that R is a Hermitian matrix. Since only the first term in (18) contains ejm,

the optimal phase shift of the m-th IRS element can be

obtained as


M +1



m = angle conj  e-jiR[i,m] . (19)

i=m

We successively design the phase shifts for all IRS el-
ements in the order from m = 1 to m = M . After we obtain the phase shifts {m }M m=1 for all elements, we will repeat the process until convergence
is attained. Note that the OF value in problem (P7)
is non-decreasing during the iterations. Furthermore, the upper bound of (17a) can be derived as Hv Rv

(M + 1) max (R) [8], where max (R) denotes the maximum eigenvalue of R. Therefore, the proposed iterative solution may converge to a locally optimal solution.
Now we will give the complexity analysis of the iterative solution. According to (19), the calculation of phases has the computational complexity order of O (M ). The process has to be repeated K times for convergency. Hence the order of complexity for passive beamforming design is O M 2K .
We summarize the proposed iterative solution in Algorithm 2. In step 2-4, all IRS elements are updated, which is repeated K times for convergence.

4.3 Extend to Discrete Phase Shifts Scenario

In this section, we consider the impact of discrete

phase shifts at the IRS. We consider the phase shifts

of IRS elements as m,m  F , where F =

denotes the discrete

phase set. The variable B is the number of quanti-

zation bits of phase shifts.

We propose a pair of quantization design

procedures. For SDR-based solution, we di-

rectly quantize the derived phase shifts as  v = ejQ(arg(~v[1:M]/~v[M+1])), where Q (·) de-
notes the quantization function, which quantizes the

complex unit-norm variables in a vector to the nearest

point in the set F .

We further propose an iterative quantization proce-

dure, which is acquired by slightly modifying the it-

erative solution for the discrete phase shifts scenario.

Specifically, during the design for the m-th IRS ele-

ment, our goal is to maximize the OF (17a). This is

equivalent to minimizing the angle between the discrete phase shift mD and m derived by (19) on the

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, we provide our simulation results char-

acterizing the proposed systems. The AP has Nt = 4 × 4 TAs and the user has Nr = 4 × 4 RAs. The number of data streams is set to Ns = 16. By contrast, the Rician factors of the reflected channels are

set to 1   and 2 = 10dB [26, 19]. The azimuth

AoD r0, r1, r2 and AoA t0, t1, t2 are uniformly dis-

tributed in the interval (-, ]. The elevation AoD 0r ,

0r , 0r and AoA 0t , 1t , 2t are uniformly distributed

[27].

The practical scenario considered for simulation is

illustrated in figure 2. The AP is located in (0, 0). The

multi-antenna user is located in (200, 30). The dis-

tance between the AP and the IRS is d2 and hence the location of the IRS is (d2, 0). The unit of the distance is meter. The path loss of the direct link is calculated

by 32.6 + 36.7log d0 dB and that for the reflected link is 35.6 + 22.0log (d1 + d2) dB [9]. The noise power spectral density is set to -170 dBm/Hz and transmis-

sion bandwidth is set to 180 kHz [9].

We first demonstrate the convergence of the pro-

posed iterative solution. We consider the cases, where

the number of IRS elements is set to M = 48, M = 64

and M = 80. The transmit power is set to  = 30dBm

and the distance is set to 200m. As shown in figure

The number of IRS elements is set to M = 64, the distance d2 is set to 200 and the transmit power ranges from 10dBm to 30dBm. We consider the following three benchmarks for comparison: 1) ADMM-based solution [17]. 2) Random Generalized: M phase shifts v are randomly selected from a uniform distribution (-, ]. 3) Without IRS: the conventional fully digital MIMO benchmark. 4) AO-based solution: the AO-based solution proposed in [18].

By contrast, in the proposed iterative solution, the phase shift of each IRS element is obtained in a one-by-one manner by maximizing the OF (18a). During the iteration, the phase shift of each IRS element is derived under the constant-modulus constraint. The iterative solution does not need the process of phase extraction, which is used in the SDR-based solution and inevitably deteriorates the spectrum efficiency. Therefore, the proposed iterative solution behaves better than the SDR-based solution. Our proposed iterative solution shows a similar spectrum efficiency performance compared to AO-

We can also observe that the iterative solution has a slightly higher spectrum efficiency than ADMM-based solution, and the computational complexity is lower when the number of IRS elements is large. Compared to the traditional MIMO systems, the spectrum efficiency gain of random generalized solution is marginal. However, the IRS-assisted MIMO systems have an increased spectrum efficiency after adopting the proposed low-complexity iterative solution.
In figure 5, we investigate the spectrum efficiency of IRS-assisted MIMO systems against the number of IRS elements. In the simulations, we set the transmit power to  = 30dBm and the distance d2 = 200. Observe that the proposed iterative solution shows a slightly better spectrum efficiency than the SDR-based solution. This is because that the SDR-based solution ameliorated by the Gaussian randomization procedure is a suboptimal solution [5]. The proposed lowcomplexity iterative solution shows a similar spectrum efficiency performance compared to AO-based solution and has a slightly higher spectrum efficiency than ADMM-based solution. Furthermore, we observe that the spectrum efficiency of IRS-assisted MIMO systems increases with M , because increasing M leads to an improved beamforming gain.
figure 6 illustrates the relationship between the spectrum efficiency and the distance between the AP and the IRS. The number of IRS elements is set to M =

64. The transmit power is set to =20dBm, while moving the IRS from (175, 0) to (205, 0). It is observed that when we increase d2 from 175 to 205, the spectrum efficiency first increases, and then decreases. The spectrum efficiency reaches the peak when d2 is about 195. This is because the path loss of the reflected link is the product of the path losses of the channel G and the channel Hr, which decreases when d2 increases from 175 to 195 and then increases as d2 continues to increase from 195 to 205.
In figure 7, we study the relationship between the spectrum efficiency and the resolution of phase shifts B. The number of IRS elements is set to M = 64, the distance d2 is set to 200. In addition to the ideal case where the phase shifts have infinite resolution, we set two finite resolution cases for comparison, including B = 3bits and B = 1bit. We observe that the 3bit resolution phase shifts can provide a near-optimal spectrum efficiency performance compared with the infinite-resolution one. Even when the resolution of phase shifts is set to 1 bit, the spectrum efficiency is higher than that of two counterparts, which are random generalized phase shifts systems and the traditional MIMO systems. Besides, we also observe that the iterative quantization procedure can achieve a higher spectrum efficiency compared to the direct quantization.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we studied an IRS-assisted point-topoint MIMO system, where both the AP and the user are equipped with multiple antennas. We maximized the spectrum efficiency by designing the active baseband beamforming at the AP and the passive beamforming at the IRS. Specifically, we decoupled the design problem and adopted the optimal baseband beamforming in conjunction with a given IRS configuration. Then, we transformed the optimization problem of the IRS elements into a non-convex QCQP by decoupling the IRS elements from the channel matrices. A low-complexity iterative solution was proposed for passive beamforming. Our simulation results demonstrated the superiority of our proposed iterative solution over the benchmarks.
