## Abstract

During the preparatory phase of the International Linear Collider (ILC) project, all technical development and engineering design needed for the start of ILC construction must be completed, in parallel with intergovernmental discussion of governance and sharing of responsibilities and cost. The ILC Preparatory Laboratory (Pre-lab) is conceived to execute the technical and engineering work and to assist the intergovernmental discussion by providing relevant information upon request. It will be based on a worldwide partnership among laboratories with a headquarters hosted in Japan. This proposal, prepared by the ILC International Development Team and endorsed by the International Committee for Future Accelerators, describes an organisational framework and work plan for the Pre-lab. Elaboration, modification and adjustment should be introduced for its implementation, in order to incorporate requirements arising from the physics community, laboratories, and governmental authorities interested in the ILC.
