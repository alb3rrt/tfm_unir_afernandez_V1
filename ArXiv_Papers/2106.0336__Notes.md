## Abstract

This paper is devoted to the complete algebraic and geometric classification of complex $4$-dimensional nilpotent left-symmetric algebras. The corresponding geometric variety has dimension $15$ and decomposes into $3$ irreducible components determined by the Zariski closures of two one-parameter families of algebras and a two-parameter family of algebras (see Theorem B). In particular, there are no rigid $4$-dimensional complex nilpotent left symmetric algebras.
