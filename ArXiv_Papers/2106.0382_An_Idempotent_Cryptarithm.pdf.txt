Abstract Notice that the square of 9376 is 87909376 which has as its rightmost four digits 9376. To generalize this remarkable fact, we show that, for each integer n  2, there exists at least one and at most two positive integers x with exactly n-digits in base-10 (meaning the leftmost or nth digit from the right is non-zero) such that squaring the integer results in an integer whose rightmost n digits form the integer x. We then generalize the argument to prove that, in an arbitrary number base B  2 with exactly m distinct prime factors, an upper bound is 2m - 2 and a lower bound is 2m-1 - 1 for the number of such n-digit positive integers. For n = 1, there are exactly 2m - 1 solutions, including 1 and excluding 0.
In Kordemsky's book, The Moscow Puzzles, the following multiplicative cryptarithm is posed as Problem 272 (G), where "... digits are represented by letters and asterisks. Identical letters stand for identical digits, different letters stand for different digits. An asterisk stands for any digit."
AT OM ×AT OM   AT OM Only a hint is provided in the solutions section: "What is the last digit of M × M? What four digits have this property? Which two can be immediately eliminated? Then consider OM ×OM, and so on. Can you prove, on your own, that AT OM = 9376 is the only possible solution?" In terms of modular arithmetic, we want to find the (apparently unique) 4-digit positive integer x such that x2  x (mod 104).
It is natural to extend the question by fixing any positive integer n and number base B  2 and asking for all non-negative solutions x to the idempotence congruence
x2  x (mod Bn)
that have n or fewer digits in base-B. The last congruence is equivalent to saying that that the rightmost n digits of x2 in base-B form the non-negative integer x in base-B (possibly with 0's padded on the left end) because higher order digits disappear modulo Bn. Moreover, in line with Kordemsky's implicit condition that A = 0 in AT OM, we can wonder how many of these solutions have exactly n digits, meaning the leftmost of the n digits is non-zero. It is with this question that we will be occupied, first in base-10 and later for general bases B  2. The quest for idempotent elements is not new, but the author is unaware of a previous result about finding a lower bound on the number of idempotent elements with exactly n digits.

1 Structure of solutions in base-10

For n = 1, it is easy to check all ten residues modulo 10 and find that the only base-10 digits that satisfy
x2  x (mod 10n)
are x = 0, 1, 5, 6. Now we tackle n  2.
Lemma 1. For each integer n  2, a multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 2n is 52n-2-1.

Proof. We will show by induction on n  2 that 52n-2  1 (mod 2n).

As a result, it will hold that
5 · 52n-2-1  1 5-1  52n-2-1

(mod 2n), (mod 2n).

The base case n = 2 holds because 522-2 = 5  1 (mod 22).

For the induction hypothesis, suppose 52n-2  1 (mod 2n)

for some integer n  2, which is equivalent to assuming that 52n-2 = 1 + xn2n

for some integer xn. Squaring the equation yields
52n-1 = 1 + xn2n+1 + x2n22n = 1 + xn(1 + xn2n-1)2n+1  1 (mod 2n+1).

This completes the inductive step and therefore the induction argument.

Theorem 2. For integers n  2, there are exactly four distinct non-negative solutions to the congruence
x2  x (mod 10n)
that are less than 10n. They are 0, 1 and the remainders of
an = 5n2n-2 , bn = 1 - an

modulo 10n. We will call the former two the "trivial solutions" and the latter two the "nontrivial solutions" rn (corresponding to an) and sn (corresponding to bn).

Proof. First we note that x is a solution to

x2  x (mod 10n)

if and only if

x(x - 1)  0 (mod 2n5n).

This holds if and only if 2n and 5n both divide x(x - 1) because 2n and 5n are coprime. Since x and x - 1 are coprime, all of the factors of 2 belong to one of them and all of the factors of 5 belong to one of them. This leads to four pairs of congruences:

x  t1 (mod 2n), x  t2 (mod 5n),

where (t1, t2) can be (0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 1). By the Chinese remainder theorem, each of the four systems gives rise to a unique solution modulo 10n. The t1 = t2 = 0 case leads to the solution x = 0, and the t1 = t2 = 1 case leads to the solution x = 1. For the other two take more effort to solve:
· If t1 = 1 and t2 = 0, then there exists an integer y such that x = 5ny, so
5ny = x  1 (mod 2n).

By Lemma 1, we know the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 2n, so

n

y  (5-1)n  52n-2-1

(mod 2n).

So there exists an integer z such that
n
x = 5ny = 5n 52n-2-1 + 2nz = 5n2n-2 + 10nz, x  5n2n-2 (mod 10n).

· If t1 = 0 and t2 = 1, then we can avoid repeating the above computations as follows. If the solution here is bn and the solution in the previous case is called an, then the two pairs of congruences

an  1 (mod 2n), an  0 (mod 5n)

and

bn  0 (mod 2n), bn  1 (mod 5n)

lead to

an + bn  1 (mod 2n) an + bn  1 (mod 5n)

As a result, we can choose bn = 1 - an.

= an + bn  1 (mod 10n).

Note that all four solutions leave distinct remainders modulo 10n because they satisfy distinct systems of two congruences with the same constituent moduli 2n and 5n. In other words, if any two of these remainders were the same modulo 10n, then they would satisfy the same pair of congruences modulo 2n and 5n, which would be untrue.
Lemma 3. For each integer n  2, let rn and sn be as in Theorem 2; let r1 = 5 and s1 = 6. Then for each pair of positive integers n > k,
rn  rk (mod 10k), sn  sk (mod 10k).

Proof. Let n > k be a pair of positive integers. If x is an integer such that the congruences
x  t1 (mod 2n), x  t2 (mod 5n),
hold, then the congruences
x  t1 (mod 2k), x  t2 (mod 5k)
also hold since 2k | 2n and 5k | 5n. By the Chinese remainder theorem, the first pair of congruences has the unique solution 0  rn < 10n for (t1, t2) = (1, 0) and the unique solution 0  sn < 10n for for (t1, t2) = (0, 1). Since rk and sk uniquely solve the second pair of congruences modulo 10k for the respective (t1, t2), we find that rn  rk (mod 10k) and sn  sk (mod 10k).
Lemma 3 explains why Table 1 shows that each value of rn or sn in a column simply pads a digit (possibly 0) on to the left of the previous value in the same class.

Table 1: The two non-trivial solutions for the first ten positive integers n in base-10
Observe in Table 1 that all pairs of non-units digits of rn and sn in corresponding places add up to 9. We will prove this fact and use it to prove Theorem 4.

Theorem 4. Let n be a positive integer. In the notation of Theorem 2 and Lemma 3, let the non-trivial solution corresponding to an be rn and the non-trivial solution corresponding to bn be sn. At least one of rn or sn has a non-zero nth digit from the right, meaning at least one of rn or sn is an n-digit integer.
Proof. We will first prove that, for all positive integers n,

rn + sn = 10n + 1.

We know that the following two congruences hold:

an  rn (mod 10n), 1 - an = bn  sn (mod 10n).

Adding them leads to

rn + sn - 1  0 (mod 10n).

Since neither rn nor sn are either of the trivial solutions 0 or 1, they are each at least 2, resulting in
0 < 3  rn + sn - 1.

Moreover, rn and sn are both at most n-digit integers, so

rn + sn - 1  (10n - 1) + (10n - 1) - 1 = 2 · 10n - 3 < 2 · 10n.

The only way that rn + sn - 1 is a multiple of 10n in the interval (0, 2 · 10n) is if rn + sn = 10n + 1.

So, for n  2, we know that

rn-1 + sn-1 = 10n-1 + 1, rn + sn = 10n + 1.

Then

(rn - rn-1) + (sn - sn-1) = (rn + sn) - (rn-1 + sn-1) = (10n + 1) - (10n-1 + 1) = 9 · 10n-1.

This proves that the nth digits from the right of rn and sn add up to 9 for n  2, so at least one of them has to be non-zero.
With the existence result established, it may be asked when there exists exactly one n-digit solution or exactly two n-digit solutions. In light of the observation about pairing digits in corresponding places in Theorem 4, it holds that in order for there to be exactly one n-digit solution, one of rn or sn must have leftmost digit 0 and the other must have leftmost digit 9. However, computational results hint that this is a difficult property to predict. The author encourages the reader to explore this area.

2 Bounds for the number of solutions in base-B

Next, we will generalize the result to any number base. As Hilbert said, "The art of doing mathematics consists in finding that special case which contains all the germs of generality." Indeed, the method for base-10 illuminates the path to a more general result as follows.

Theorem 5. Let B  2 be an integer with exactly m  1 distinct prime factors. Then, for each integer n  2, there are at most 2m - 2 and at least 2m-1 - 1 positive integers x with exactly n digits in base-B (meaning the leftmost or nth digit from the right is non-zero) such that
x2  x (mod Bn).
For n = 1, there are exactly 2m - 1 positive (single-digit) solutions.

Proof. Let the base be

B = pe11pe22 · · · pemm

for distinct primes factors pi and positive integer multiplicities ei. Using the fact that the prime powers peii are all coprime to each other and that x and x - 1 are coprime to each
other, we find that x is a solution to

x2  x (mod Bn)

if and only if a system of m congruences of the following form is satisfied:

x  0 or 1 x  0 or 1
... x  0 or 1

(mod pn1e1), (mod pn2e2),
(mod pnmem).

Each right side can be 0 or 1, so there are 2m possible systems of congruences. Each such system has a unique solution 0  x < Bn by the Chinese remainder theorem. So there are at most 2m solutions with n digits. If all of the ti equal 0 then the solution is 0, and if all of the ti equal 1 then the solution is 1. We may omit the x = 0, 1 solutions (which have fewer than n  2 digits) for an upper bound of 2m - 2. Now we will use a pairing technique. Given a particular system of congruences of the above form, we can pair it with its twin which swaps the 0's for 1's and 1's for 0's on the right sides of the congruences. This produces 2m-1 - 1 non-trivial twins. If an is a solution to one of the two systems and bn is a solution to the other, we find that
an + bn  1 (mod Bn)
by adding corresponding pairs of congruences from the two systems of congruences, and then combining all of the moduli. We will show that the remainder modulo Bn of at least one of an or bn has exactly n digits in base-B.
Note that, if a particular instance of the above system, say

x  t1 (mod pn1e1),

6

x  t2 ...
x  tm

(mod pn2e2), (mod pnmem),

is satisfied, then the system

x  t1
x  t2 ...

(mod pk1e1), (mod pk2e2),

x  tm (mod pkmem)

is also satisfied for positive integers k < n. This means that, similar to Lemma 3, we can classify the solutions over all positive integers n into 2m classes (including the 0-class and the 1-class) corresponding to the 2m different m-tuples

(t1, t2, . . . , tm)  {0, 1}m,

with each solution within a particular class padding a digit (possibly 0) to the left of the previous solution in that class.
Let rn be the remainder of an and sn be the remainder of bn modulo Bn. Then

rn + sn  an + bn  1 (mod Bn).

Now we will follow the method shown in Theorem 4 of using inequalities to prove that

rn + sn = Bn + 1

for all positive integers n. Since we have already omitted the trivial twin solutions 0 and 1 from the possibilities, rn and sn are each at least 2, so

0 < 3 = 2 + 2 - 1  rn + sn - 1.

Moreover, rn and sn each have at most n digits in base-B, so

rn + sn - 1  (Bn - 1) + (Bn - 1) - 1 = 2 · Bn - 3 < 2 · Bn.

The only way that Bn | rn + sn - 1, with rn + sn - 1  (0, 2 · Bn) is if

rn + sn = Bn + 1,

as predicted. So, for all integers n  2, we can use the equations

rn-1 + sn-1 = Bn-1 + 1, rn + sn = Bn + 1

7

to find that (rn - rn-1) + (sn - sn-1) = (rn + sn) - (rn-1 + sn-1) = (Bn + 1) - (Bn-1 + 1) = (B - 1)Bn-1.
Thus, for n  2, the nth digit from the right of rn and the nth digit from the right of sn add up to B - 1 > 0. So both of those digits cannot be 0, proving that at least one of the solutions in this twin has exactly n digits in base-B. There are 2m-1 - 1 of these non-trivial twins, which establishes the lower bound.
Lastly, the one-digit positive solutions (for n = 1) are all the solutions in the interval (0, B) of the congruence
x(x - 1)  0 (mod B). There are 2m solutions by distributing the maximal prime power factors of B across the coprime integers x and x - 1. We omit 0 to get the exact number 2m - 1.
