IDENTITIES FOR THE EULER POLYNOMIALS, p-ADIC INTEGRALS AND WITT'S FORMULA

SU HU AND MIN-SOO KIM

Abstract. By using Cauchy's formula, it is known that Bernoulli num-

bers and Euler numbers can be represented by the contour integrals

Bn

=

n! 2i

z dz ez - 1 zn+1 ,

En

=

n! 2i

2ez dz e2z + 1 zn+1 ,

while the following Witt's formula represents Euler polynomials through the fermionic p-adic integrals

En(a) = (x + a)ndµ-1(x).
Zp
Base on the above Witt's identity and the binomial theorem, we prove some new identities for the Euler polynomials briefly. In particular, some symmetry properties of Euler polynomials have been discovered, which implies many interesting identities (known or unknown), including the Kaneko-Momiyama type identities (shown by Wu, Sun, and Pan) and the Alzer-Kwong type identity for Euler polynomials.

1. Introduction

1.1. Background. Denote by N = {1, 2, . . .} and N0 = N  {0}. The Bernoulli polynomials Bn(a) are defined by the generating function

and Bn = Bn(0) are named Bernoulli numbers. These numbers and polynomials arise from Bernoulli's calculations of power sums in 1713, that is,

m jn = Bn+1(m + 1) - Bn+1 n+1
j=1

(see [23, p. 5, (2.2)]). The Euler polynomials En(a) are defined by the generating function

These polynomials were introduced by Euler who studied the alternating power sums, that is,

En(0)

j=1

(see [23, p. 5, (2.3)]). It is easy to see that the first few Euler polynomials are

(1.3)

E0(a) = 1,

E1(a)

=

a

,

E2(a) = a2 - a,

E3(a) = a3 -

.

The Euler numbers En are defined by

(1.4)

En = 2nEn

1 2

and E2n+1 = 0 for n  N (see for instance [1, p. 804, 23.1.2] and [16, (0.1)]). The Euler numbers and polynomials (so called by Scherk in 1825) appear in Euler's famous book, Insitutiones Calculi Differentials (1755, pp. 487­ 491 and p. 522) and have been found many applications in combinatorics, number theory, classical and p-adic analysis. For example, see Abramowitz and Stegun [1], Agoh and Dilcher [3], Chen and Sun [4], Gessel [6], He and Zhang [7], Kim and Hu [12], Koblitz [13], Robert [19], Simsek [21] and Sun [22].
From the definition (1.2) we can easily deduce the following identities:

(1.5)

En(1 - a) = (-1)nEn(a),

(1.6)

(-1)nEn(-a) + En(a) = 2an

(see for instance [1, p. 804, 23.1.8 and 23.1.9] ). Letting a = 1 in (1.5), we have a relation between the special values of
Euler polynomials at 1 and 0 :

(1.7)

En(1) = (-1)nEn(0) =

1 -En(0)

for n = 0 for n = 0,

because En(0) = 0 if n is even. In 2004, Wu, Sun and Pan [24, (7) and (9)] proved the following inter-
esting formulae:

(1.8)

m

= (-1)m+12(m + n + 2)(Em+n+1(a) - am+n+1).

3

Here

m i

denotes the usual binomial coefficient. The identity (1.8) can be

viewed as a version of the Kaneko-Momiyama type identity for Euler polyno-

mials. In Section 3, we shall give an alternative proof of (1.8) (see Remark

1.7 below). The identity (1.9) is an Euler polynomial version of Kaneko-

Momiyama relations among Bernoulli numbers. See Kaneko [8], Momiyama

[17], Gessel [6] and Wu-Sun-Pan [24] for details. In fact, we can see that

Theorem 1.1 reduces to (1.9) by setting q = k = 1 (see Remark 1.2 be-

low). More recently, by using Zeilberger's algorithm [25], Chen and Sun [4]

gave new proofs of many existing recurrence relations between Bernoulli

polynomials.

The aim of this paper is to present new identities for the Euler polyno-

mials which extend (1.8) and (1.9). Our main tool is the fermionic p-adic

integral on Zp, and in the next section we shall give a brief recall of the

definition and identities for this integral. Using them the detail proofs for

the main theorems will be shown in the final section.

1.2. Main results. Our main results and their corollaries are as follows.

Theorem 1.1. Let k, q  N and let m, n  N0 such that m + n > 0. Then for given odd integer k, we have

m+q
(-1)m
i=0

m+q i

n+q+i k

En+q+i-k(a)

n+q
+ (-1)n

n+q j

j=0

m+q+j k

Em+q+j-k(-a) = 0.

Remark 1.2. Considering the identity (1.6), it is easily checked that

(1.10)

(-1)m(m + n + 2)Em+n+1(a) + (-1)n(m + n + 2)Em+n+1(-a) = (-1)m(m + n + 2)(Em+n+1(a) + (-1)m+nEm+n+1(-a)) = (-1)m2(m + n + 2)(Em+n+1(a) - am+n+1).

Thus letting q = k = 1 in Theorem 1.1, we recover Wu, Sun and Pan's formula (1.9).

Put m = n, q = k and a = 0 in Theorem 1.1, we get an Euler polynomial version of Z´ekiri and Bencherif's formula which was stated for Bernoulli numbers (see [26, Theorem 1.1]).

Corollary 1.3. Let n  N0. Then for given odd integers q, we have

m+q

m+q i

(n + q + i)(n + q + i - 1) · · · (n + i + 1)En+i(0) = 0.

i=0

Note that the above identity is also an Euler polynomial version of Kaneko's identity [8] when q = 1, Chen and Sun's identity [4] when q = 3.
Put a = 0 and q = k = 1 in Theorem 1.1, we have the following analogue of Momiyama's formula [17].

Corollary 1.4. Let m, n  N0 such that m + n > 0. Then we have

m+1

m+1 i

(n + i + 1)En+i(0)

i=0

n+1
+ (-1)m+n

n+1 j

(m + j + 1)Em+j(0) = 0.

j=0

If we put m = n in Corollary 1.4, then we get the following dentity.

Corollary 1.5. For any n  N0,

n+1

n+1 j

(n + j + 1)En+j(0) = 0.

j=0

This can be regarded as an Euler polynomial version of Kaneko's formulae which was stated for Bernoulli numbers (see [8]). From the above identity, we have a recurrence relationship

(1.11)

E2n+1(0)

=

-

1 2(n +

1)

n

n+1 j

(n + j + 1)En+j(0),

j=0

It is an interest, sinece from this, in order to to calculate E2n+1(0), we only needs half of the previous terms (Ek(0) with n  k  2n with k odd).
We show that the p-adic integral is also work for proving the following Sun's identity for Euler polynomials.

Theorem 1.6 (Sun's identity, see [22, Theorem 1.2(iii)]). We have

m
(-1)m

m i

am-iEn+i(b) = (-1)n

n

n j

an-j Em+j (c),

i=0

j=0

where a + b + c = 1.

Remark 1.7. In the case a = 1, b = t and c = -t, Theorem 1.6 reduces to (1.8).

Putting a = 1, b = 1/2 and c = -1/2 in Theorem 1.6, we get the following consequence which can also be found in Chen and Sun's work (see [4, Theorem 6.1]).

Corollary 1.8. We have

where m, n  N0.

Motivated by the above works, we have the following general result.

Theorem 1.9. Let s  N and let k, m, n  N0 such that m + n > 0. Then we have

s,k

m+1
(s + 1)m-i+1

where Pm(k,)n,s(l; a) satisfy the relation

dk dxk

(x + a)m+1(x + a - s - 1)n+1

+ (-1)m+n(x - a)n+1(x - a - s - 1)m+1

x=l

and s,k can be expressed as

 +2  s,k = (-1)s - (-1)k = -2
0

for s even, k odd, for s odd, k even, otherwise.

Using Theorem 1.9, we may obtain many (well-known or new) properties for Euler numbers and polynomials. Here are some few examples.
Put m = n, s = 1 and a = 0 in Theorem 1.9, we have

Corollary 1.10. (1) If k is even, then

n+1 (-1)i n + 1

2i

i

i=0

(2) If k is odd, then

n+i+1 k

(-1)iEn+i-k+1(0) + (-1)n = 0.

n+1 (-1)i n + 1

2i

i

i=0

n+i+1 k

= 0.

Put m = n, s = 2 and a = 0 in Theorem 1.9, we obtain

Corollary 1.11. (1) If k is odd, then

n+1
(-1)i3n-i+1

n+1 i

i=0

n+i+1 k

× ((-1)iEn+i-k+1(0) + (-1)n(2n+i-k+1 - 1)) = 0.

(2) If k is even, then

n+1
(-1)i3n-i+1

n+1 i

i=0

n+i+1 k

(2n+i-k+1 - 1) = 0.

Theorem 1.12. Let k, m  N0 with 0  k  m. Then we have

m

m

i
i=0 m+i even

m+i k

Em+i-k (a)

=

m
(-1)m+j

m j

j=0

m+j k

am+j-k.

This can be regarded as an Euler polynomials version of Alzer and Kwong's formulae which was stated for Bernoulli polynomials (see [2, Theorem 1]).
An application of Theorem 1.12 leads to

Theorem 1.13. (1) For 0  k  m, we have

m

m

i
i=0 m+i even

m+i k

m+i-k m-k

Ei(0) = (-1)m

m k

.

(2) For 0  k  m - 1, we have

m

m

i
i=0 m+i even

m+i k

m+i-k m-k-1

Ei+1(0) = 0.

(3) For 0  l  m - k - 1, we have

m

m

i
i=0 m+i even

m+i k

m+i-k l

Em+i-k-l(0) = 0.

(4) For 1  j  m and 0  k  m, we have

m

m

i
i=j m+i even

m+i k

m+i-k m+j-k

Ei-j(0) = (-1)m+j

m j

m+j k

.

Remark 1.14. In the case k = 0 and l = 1, Theorem 1.13(3) turns out to be Corollary 1.5 since En(0) = 0 if n is even. When k = 0 and l = 3, Theorem 1.13(3) yield the following interesting identity:

(1.12)

m

m i

(m + i)(m + i - 1)(m + i - 2)Em+i-3(0) = 0,

m  3,

i=0

since Em(0) = 0 if m is even, and it remains valid if replaced En(0) by Bernoulli numbers Bn (see [4, Theorem 7.1]).

2. The fermionic p-adic integrals and Witt's formula

In the next two sections, we shall use the following notations.

p - an odd rational prime number.

Zp - the ring of p-adic integers. Qp - the field of fractions of Zp.

Cp - the completion of a fixed algebraic closure Qp of Qp.

By using Cauchy's formula, it is known that Bernoulli numbers and Euler numbers can be represented by the contour integrals

(2.1)

n! 2i

ez

z -

dz zn+1

,

(2.2)

En

=

n! 2i

2ez dz e2z + 1 zn+1

(see [4, (2.1) and (2.2)]). The following Witt's formula represents Euler polynomials through the
fermionic p-adic integrals.

Lemma 2.1 (Witt's formula). For any n  N0 and x  Qp, we have

(x + a)ndµ-1(x) = En(a).
Zp

Furthermore, Zp dµ-1(x) = E0(a) = 1.

In this section, we shall give a brief overview of the definition and identities for the fermionic p-adic integrals, for details, we refer to [12]. The fermionic p-adic integral of a function f : Zp  Cp is defined by

(2.3)

pN -1

I-1(f ) = f (x)dµ-1(x) = lim

f (x)(-1)x,

Zp

N  x=0

and this limits exists if f is continuous on Zp. The fermionic p-adic integral (2.3) were independently found by Katz [9, p. 486] (in Katz's notation, the µ(2)-measure), Shiratani and Yamamoto [20], Christol [5], Osipov [18], Lang [14] (in Lang's notation, the E1,2-measure), T. Kim [10] from very different viewpoints. Recently, the fermionic p-adic integral on Zp is used by the authors [12] to present many properties of the p-adic Hurwitz-type Euler zeta functions, including Laurent series expansions, functional equations, derivative formulas, and p-adic Raabe formulas, and it has also been used by Kim [11] and Ma¨iga [15] to give some new identities and congruences concerning Euler numbers and polynomials.
Let D  Cp is an arbitrary subset closed under a  a + x for x  Zp and a  D. That is, D could be Cp\Zp, Qp\Zp or Zp.
For a continuous function f on Zp, the fermionic p-adic integral

(2.4)

F (a) = f (x + a)dµ-1(x), (a  D)
Zp

8

SU HU AND MIN-SOO KIM

is then defined and satisfies the equation

(2.5)

F (a + 1) + F (a) = 2f (a).

(See, e.g., [12, p. 2982, Theorem 2.2(1)]). From (2.5), we have

(2.6)

F (a + q) + F (a + q - 1) = 2f (a + q - 1),

where a  D and q  N. Adding and subtracting this identity alternatively for q = 1, 2, . . . , n gives the formula

(2.7)

q-1
(-1)q-1F (a + q) + F (a) = 2 (-1)if (a + i),

i=0
where a  D and q  N. Note that the above identity (2.7) reduces to [10, Theorem 2] by setting
a = 0. In order to prove (1.8), Theorem 1.1, 1.6, 1.9, 1.12 and 1.13, we need the
following lemma which has been obtained by T. Kim in [10, Lemma 1], and Kim and Hu in [12, Theorem 2.2(2)].

Lemma 2.2. Let f be a continuous function on Zp. We have the functional equation

(2.8)

I-1(f-) = I-1(f1) = -I-1(f ) + 2f (0),

where f-(x) = f (-x), f1(x) = f (x + 1) for all x  Zp. In particular, if f is an even function, then
I-1(f ) = f (0).

Using (2.5) and Lemma 2.2, we get Witt's formula for Euler polynomials (see Lemma 2.1 above).

3. Proofs of (1.8), Theorem 1.1, 1.6, 1.9, 1.12 and 1.13

In this section, we prove six results for Euler polynomials. Many more identities can be obtained from this way easily.

Proof of (1.8). For a  D, we consider the polynomial function f (x) = (-1)m(x + a)m(x + a - 1)n

on Zp. Then by the binomial theorem, we have

m
(3.1) f (x + 1) = (-1)m(x + a + 1)m(x + a)n = (-1)m

i=0

and

(3.2)

n
f (-x) = (-1)n

n j

(x - a)m+j.

j=0

m i

(x + a)n+i

Note that f (x) is continuous on Zp, as a product of two such functions, so the fermionic p-adic integral for the functions in the above equalities are

9

well­defined. By integrating both sides of (3.1) and (3.2) respectively, we have

(3.3)

m

f (x + 1)dµ-1(x) = (-1)m

Zp

i=0

m i

(x + a)n+idµ-1(x),
Zp

and

(3.4)

n

f (-x)dµ-1(x) = (-1)n

Zp

j=0

n j

(x - a)m+jdµ-1(x).
Zp

(2.8) in Lemma 2.2 leads to

(3.5)

f (x + 1)dµ-1(x) = f (-x)dµ-1(x).

Zp

Zp

Then comparing (3.3) (3.4) and (3.5), we have

m
(-1)m

m i

i=0

n

(x+a)n+idµ-1(x) = (-1)n

Zp

j=0

n j

(x-a)m+j dµ-1(x).
Zp

Applying Lemma 2.1, the Witt's formula, we get (1.8).

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let a  D, q, k  N and let m and n be nonnegative integers with m + n > 0. If we define the polynomials function h(x) on Zp by

h(x) = (x + a)m+q(x + a - 1)n+q + (-1)m+n(x - a - 1)m+q(x - a)n+q,

then we have

h(x + 1) = h(-x).

Taking

d dx

k

on the both sides of the above identity, we have

h(k)(x

+

1)

=

dkh(x + dxk

1)

=

dkh(-x) dxk

=

(-1)kh(k)(-x),

which gives

h(k)(x + 1) = -h(k)(-x) for k being odd.

By integrating both sides of the above equality, we get

(3.6)

h(k)(-x)dµ-1(x) = - h(k)(x + 1)dµ-1(x)

Zp

Zp

for k being odd, since h(k)(x) is continuous on Zp. Applying (2.8) in Lemma 2.2 to the left hand side of (3.6), we have

(3.7)

h(k)(-x)dµ-1(x) = h(k)(x + 1)dµ-1(x).

Zp

Zp

Combining (3.6) with (3.7), we get the following formula

h(k)(x + 1)dµ-1(x) = - h(k)(x + 1)dµ-1(x),

Zp

Zp

10

SU HU AND MIN-SOO KIM

or equivalently,

(3.8)

h(k)(x + 1)dµ-1(x) = 0
Zp

for k being odd. To calculate the left-hand side of the above equation, we

rewrite h(x + 1) in the form

m+q
h(x + 1) =

m+q i

n+q
(x + a)n+q+i + (-1)m+n

n+q j

(x - a)m+q+j .

Then

+ (-1)m+nk!

n+q j

j=0

m+q+j k

(x - a)m+q+j-k.

Applying (3.8) to the above k-th derivative h(k)(x + 1), and use Lemma 2.1, the Witt's formula, we conclude our assertion for k being odd.

Proof of Theorem 1.6. For a+b+c = 1, we consider the polynomial function

g(x) = (-1)m(x + a + b - 1)m(x + b - 1)n

on Zp. (1) We have

(3.9)

m
g(x + 1) = (-1)m

m i

am-i(x + b)n+i.

i=0

(2) Since a + b + c = 1, we have

g(-x) = (-1)m(-x + a + b - 1)m(-x + b - 1)n

= (-1)n(x - a - b + 1)m(x - b + 1)n

(3.10)

= (-1)n(x + c)m(x + a + c)n

This implies Theorem 1.6 by using Lemma 2.1.

Proof of Theorem 1.9. Let a  D, s  N and let k, m, n  N0 such that m + n > 0. Let us define the polynomials Pm,n,s(x; a) by

(3.14)

Pm,n,s(x; a) = (x + a)m+1(x + a - s - 1)n+1 + (-1)m+n(x - a)n+1(x - a - s - 1)m+1

on Zp. Then we have

Pm,n,s(x + s + 1; a) = Pm,n,s(-x; a),

which gives

(3.15)

Pm(k,)n,s(x + s + 1; a) = (-1)kPm(k,)n,s(-x; a).

It is easily seen that

s
(-1)l Pm(k,)n,s(x + j + 1; a) + Pm(k,)n,s(x + j; a)
l=1
= -Pm(k,)n,s(x + 1; a) + (-1)sPm(k,)n,s(x + s + 1; a).

Therefore we have

Since Zp dµ-1(x) = E0(a) = 1, substituting (3.17) into the left hand side of (3.16), then using Lemma 2.1, we get

This completes our proof.

Proof of Theorem 1.12. For a  D, we consider the polynomial function

q(x) = (x + a)m(x + a - 1)m

on Zp. By the binomial theorem, the formula q(x) and q(x + 1) can be rewritten as

q(x) =

m
(-1)m+i

m i

(x + a)m+i,

i=0

m
q(x + 1) =

m i

(x + a)m+i,

respectively. Hence, we have (3.18)
m
q(k)(x + 1) + q(k)(x) = k!
i=0
= 2k! 0

m i

m+i k

(x + a)m+i-k

if m + i odd

and (3.19)

m
q(k)(0) = k! (-1)m+j

am+j-k.

The second equality in (2.8) of Lemma 2.2 implies

(3.20)

(q(k)(x + 1) + q(k)(x))dµ-1(x) = 2q(k)(0).
Zp

On expanding (3.20) by (3.18) and (3.19), we obtain

and the result follows from Lemma 2.1.

Proof of Theorem 1.13. We consider the polynomial function r(x) = xm(x - 1)m

on Zp. By the binomial theorem, the formula r(x) and r(x + 1) can be rewritten as

r(x) =

m
(-1)m+i

m i

xm+i

and

m
r(x + 1) =

To see Part (1), note that by (3.21),

(3.23)

Similarly, by (3.22) we obtain

x=0

since 0j = 1 if j = 0 and 0j = 0 if j  N. The second equality in (2.8) of Lemma 2.2 implies

(3.25)

(r(m)(x + 1) + r(m)(x))dµ-1(x) = 2r(m)(0).

Substituting (3.23) and (3.24) into (3.25), we have

which leads to Part (1) by using Lemma 2.1, with a = 0. The Parts (2), (3) and (4) can be shown in a similar way with Part
(1).
