## Abstract

In this work, we present the calculation of the production cross sections of bottomonia states using Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD) formalism. The direct production cross-section of a resonance can be factorised in terms of short distance Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) cross sections and long distance matrix elements (LDMEs) under NRQCD. We use a large set of measured $\Upsilon$(nS) production data at Tevatron and LHC energies in both central and forward rapidity regions to extract the LDMEs with better precision. The feed down contributions from the higher states including the $\chi_{b}$(3P) state are taken into account for the LDME extraction. The formalism provides a good description of the bottomonia data in wide transverse momentum range at different collision energies.
