## Abstract

We show that for any $d=d(n)$ with $d_0(\epsilon) \le d =o(n)$, with high probability, the size of a largest induced cycle in the random graph $G(n,d/n)$ is $(2\pm \epsilon)\frac{n}{d}\log d$. This settles a long-standing open problem in random graph theory.

## Comments

11 pages; this work reuses parts from an earlier work of the second author ( arXiv:2102.09289 , not to be published), the result is now optimal thanks to new ideas and two new authors
