## Abstract

In this paper, we introduce and study the $S$-weak global dimension $S$-w.gl.dim$(R)$ of a commutative ring $R$ for some multiplicative subset $S$ of $R$. Moreover, commutative rings with $S$-weak global dimension at most $1$ are studied. Finally, we investigated the $S$-weak global dimension of factor rings and polynomial rings.
