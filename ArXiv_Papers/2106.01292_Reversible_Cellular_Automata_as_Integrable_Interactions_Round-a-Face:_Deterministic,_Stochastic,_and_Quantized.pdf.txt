(Dated: June 4, 2021)
A family of reversible deterministic cellular automata, including the rules 54 and 201 of [Bobenko et al., Commun. Math. Phys. 158, 127 (1993)] as well as their kinetically constrained quantum (unitary) or stochastic deformations, is shown to correspond to integrable Floquet circuit models with local interactions round-a-face. Using inhomogeneous solutions of the star-triangle relation with a one or two dimensional spectral parameter, changing their functional form depending on the orientation, we provide an explicit construction of the transfer matrix and establish its conservation law and involutivity properties. Integrability is independently demonstrated by numerically exploring the spectral statistics via the Berry-Tabor conjecture. Curiously, we find that the deformed rule 54 model generically possesses no other local conserved quantities besides the net soliton current.

Introduction.­ Exactly solved models based on star-triangle (aka Yang-Baxter) equation represent the main cornerstone of statistical mechanics in two dimensions (2d) [1, 2]. These solutions provide nontrivial mappings from equilibrium physics in 2d to non-equilibrium (time-dependent) quantum and stochastic models in one dimension. This way one relates the Bethe ansatz for the spectra and eigenfunctions of quantum spin chains and stochastic simple exclusion processes (integrable interacting Markov chains) to integrable vertex models.
It is however very difficult and often even impossible to obtain explicit time-dependent results in typical integrable interacting models. Recently, a deterministic interacting particle model has been thoroughly studied [3­17], namely the reversible cellular automaton (RCA) rule 54 of classification [18]. Particular striking and useful was the discovery of an exact time-dependent matrix-product ansatz for dynamics of observables which allows for the proof [10] of coexistence of ballistic (convective) and diffusive (conductive) transport, beyond hydrodynamic assumptions [19]. The key feature which allows for further insight into dynamics as compared to generic integrable systems seems to be a constant scattering shift among quasiparticle excitations which all propagate at the maximal bare velocity (cf. similar features observed recently in folded XXZ model [20­22] or q-boson model [23]).
However, despite a long standing effort it has not been established if and how the rule 54 RCA relates to Yang-Baxter integrability, whereas the connection has been understood a while ago [24] for a `less local' class of RCA, namely the box-ball systems [25]. The locality and relativistic-look-alike structure of the update rule of RCA 54 might suggest that one should look for the connection to integrability within the framework of interaction round-a-face (IRF) [1, 2, 26­28] rather than the more common vertex models.
This is exactly what we attempt and achieve in this Letter by embedding (deforming) RCA rules 54 and 201 into a large four-parametric families of kinetically constrained quantum (Floquet circuit) or classical stochastic (Markov circuit) models. We find novel inhomogeneous (or anisotropic) solutions of the star-triangle equation where the R-matrices take functionally different forms depending on the orientation of the diagram. We build the transfer matrix generating an extensive

set of conserved and mutually commuting operators, which seem to be, however, manifestly nonlocal for the deformed rule 54. This result provides a basis to study broad classes of integrable kinetically constrained models.

FIG. 1. Exemplar stationary state trajectories of SCAs: stochastic deformations of rule 54 (left), 201 (middle), 150 (right), all for  = 0.8,  = 0.65 and lattice halfsizes (N,t) = (50, 100) (time runs downwards). While the first two models are Yang-Baxter integrable, the third seems not.

U maps basis states |i1, . . . , i2N , ix  {0, 1}, to basis states,
so dynamics can be fully characterised in terms of trajectories of configurations |it1, . . . , it2N = U t |i01, . . . , i02N . Notable examples considered here are:

rule 54 : f00 = 1, f01 = f10 = f11 = X ,

(5)

rule 201 : f00 = X , f01 = f10 = f11 = 1,

(6)

rule 150 : f00 = 1, f01 = f10 = X, f11 = 1. (7)

While the rule 54 is a paradigmatic solvable example of interacting deterministic dynamics with coexisting ballistic and diffusive transport [3, 10], rule 201 represents a classical deterministic [30] and Floquet [31, 32] variant of PXP model [33, 34] of kinetically constrained dynamics [35], and rule 150 is a classical deterministic version of the XORFredrickson-Andersen model [36] which can be interpreted in terms of non-interacting dynamics [37]. (ii) When fkl  U(2) are unitary, also the many body map (1) is unitary and corresponds to a unitary quantum local Floquet circuit or quantum cellular automaton (QCA) [38], see e.g. [39, 40] for recent discussion of QCA of this type. (iii) When fkl are stochastic matrices, ( fkl)ij  R0, i( fkl)ij = 1, the map (1) is also stochastic and corresponds to a local Markov chain circuit or stochastic cellular automaton (SCA), see Fig. 1 for typical sections of long-time trajectories.
In this Letter we shall consider kinetically constrained deformation of RCA (5-7) where f00 is replaced by

f00 =

and ,  , ,   C are arbitrary mixing parameters. In other words, the only non-deterministic local process in the map (2) happens when neigbouring sites are both in state 0: |000   |000 +  |010 , |010   |000 +  |010 . We stress that all algebraic integrable structures discovered here apply for

We n

Integrability of deformed rule 201.­ Following exactly the same procedure for deformed rule 201 (6,8) we obtain, up to a gauge (12) and spatial/temporal reflection, unique [41] Lax operators depending on a 2-component spectral parameter, in terms of which we again express the spatial and temporal IRF gates:

(gkl )ij = Lki,,lj(1/1, 2/2) .

(25)

These objects in turn define a 2-parametric conserved (14) TM

T ( ), cf. (13), satisfying involutivity (15).

Attempting to repeat the procedure for deformed rule 150

(7,8) we failed to find nontrivial solutions to star-triangle re-

lation (9). Thus we conclude that, while rules 54 and 201 can

be considered embedded in large multiparametric integrable

families, the noninteracting rule 150 becomes instantly non-

integrable when deformed.

Alternatively, it may be convenient to use a notation closer

to Baxter [1] and parametrize L, M in terms of quads of 2 × 2
matrices kl, mkl, via ( kl)ij  Lik,,lj, (mkl)ij  Mik,,l j and defining embedded 3-site local operators Lx or Mx via (2) on extended state space H = (C2)(2N+2) (including a pair of

sites x = 0, 2N + 1), with fkl replaced by kl or mkl, respec-

tively. Then, the star-triangle Eq. (9) reads Fx+1MxLx+1 =

LxMx+1Fx (and analogously for (17,18)). TM (13) now reads

g-a1s i

an |i

ordered operator product i|x |i i|y and tracing out

equipped with projectors the two auxiliary sites,

Px,y

=

T = tr0,2N+1(P1,2N+1M1L2M3L4 · · · M2N-1L2N P0,2N ), (26)

where  is a lattice shift operator over H defined as  |i1i2 . . . i2N = |i2 . . . i2Ni1 . In case of unitary deformations (8) the matrices kl( ), mkl( ), and hence Lx, Mx, are unitary exactly when the spectral parameters(s) is(are) unimodular |i| = 1. Due to boundary terms in (26) one would perhaps expect finite size breaking of unitarity of TM. Nevertheless,
we find by explicit computation that TM is exactly unitary
T ( )T ( )||i|=1 = 1, for both cases (10,11), and (22,23).
Local conservation laws and level statistics.­ In order to
study physics of (deformed) RCA it is natural to investigate
the structure of (quasi)local conserved charges or currents
[42­44]. We note first that all RCA (5,6,7) with general deformation (8), preserve a diagonal U(1) charge which can be
interpreted as a net soliton current (the density of right movers minus the density of left movers), Z is a diagonal Pauli matrix:

N
 J = (Z2x-1Z2x - Z2xZ2x+1), [J , U ] = 0 . (27) x=1

For stochastic deformations this can also be observed inspecting Fig. 1. As TM (26), for generic unitary deformation, does not reduce to a shift at any specific value of the spectral parameter, its log-derivatives  log T ( ) = [T ( )] T ( ) will not yield local operators for any unimodular  . Yet, we may expect that the latter are quasilocal charges, in full analogy to established quasilocal charges related to six-vertex model [42]. We have furthermore checked empirically for the existence of any strictly local conserved charges by adapting the Algorithm 2, Sec. 7 of Ref. [45] from the 2-qubit operator gate to 3-qubit control-operator gate W^ x(a) = Fx-1aFx. Remarkably, we have indeed found no additional local conserved charge for support size up to r = 5 consecutive sites, for the deformed rule 54. For deformed rule 201, we found one charge even under x  2N + 1 - x (in addition to an odd one (27)) for r = 3, and additional two even and two odd charges for r = 5. Notably, all the local charges Q for deformed rule 201 are diagonal (can be written solely in terms of Zx) and are unrelated (Hilbert-Schmidt orthogonal) to TM trQT ( )  0. Unsurprisingly, we have found no additional local charges for the nonintegrable deformed rule 150.
It seems rather striking to suggest an existence of a completely integrable extended locally interacting model with a single local conserved quantity. One may wonder if such a model still obeys the standard conjectures, say if eigenvalues of Floquet propagator U represent an uncorrelated Poisson process (Berry-Tabor conjecture [47, 48]). Given N, we have diagonalized the matrix of [U ]K projected to fixed quasi-momentum K  {0, . . . , N - 1} sector of Hilbert space {| ; 2 | = e2iK/N | }. As [U ]K = V 2 can be written as a square [49], where V = [U e]K, we have thus analyzed the spectrum of V fixing as well the eigenvalue J of the conserved soliton current J . The numerical results are summarized in Fig. 3 showing the cumulative level spacing distribution I(s), giving the probability that a random spacing between adjacent eigenphases of V (normalized to mean unit spacing) is smaller than s, for unitary (quantum) deformations of automata (5,7,6). While generic Poisson spectrum was observed for deformed rule 54, a macroscopic degeneracy has been observed for deformed rule 201 (suggesting hidden non-abelian quantum symmetry of the model) again conforming to the Poisson model for non-degenerate levels. Finally, deformed rule 150 exhibits random matrix spectral statistics, suggesting it to be a quantum chaotic model. Fully compatible results have been found for spectral statistics of generic complex deformations of the RCAs in terms of analyzing complex spacing ratios [46] which thus model integrable and chaotic non-Hermitian [50] kinetically constrained systems.
Conclusions.­ This Letter provides a backbone of integrability for kinetically constrained interacting lattice dynamics, being either deterministic, stochastic or quantum. This immediately opens several avenues for further quest of more explicit results related to nonequilibrium dynamics of these models, e.g. identifying complete sets of quasiparticle excitations and fundamental scattering relations among them leading to the generalized hydrodynamic theory of transport [19],

The average radial and angular spacing ratios (see [46] for definitions) are: (b) r = 0.669, cos  = 0.002 (Poissonian values 2/3, 0), (c) r = 0.719, cos  = -0.177 (AI random matrix ensemble estimates 0.722, -0.185). All spectra contain 10800 levels each (N = 9, sector with fixed quasi-momentum K = 1 and soliton current J = 0).
or targeting exact spatio-temporal correlation functions generalising the results [10, 14, 16] for the deterministic rule 54.
Finally, our model should also be of interest as a nontrivial exactly solved model in 2d statistical mechanics, either thinking of a homogeneous partition function composed of f - or g- IRF plaquettes, or a staggered partition function composed of columns of L- and M- plaquettes. Apparently, previous attempts to construct exactly solvable staggered IRF models could not go beyond free fermion models [51].
