Abstract
The Thue number (G) of a graph G is the minimum number of colors needed to color G without creating a square on a path of G. For a graph class C, (C) is the supremum of (G) over the graphs G  C. The Thue number has been investigated for famous minorclosed classes: (tree) = 4, 7 (outerplanar) 12, and 11 (planar) 768. Following a suggestion of Grytczuk, we consider the generalized parameters k(C) such that only squares of period at least k must be avoided. Thus, (C) = 1(C). We show that 5(tree) = 2, 2(tree) = 3, and k(planar) 11 for every fixed k.
1 Introduction
A coloring of a graph G is non-repetitive if the sequence induced by the colors of any path of G is not a square. The Thue number (G) of G is the minimum number of colors needed in a non-repetitive coloring G. Recall that the period of a square uu is |u|.
For a graph class C, (C) is the supremum of (G) over the graphs G  C. Let twk denote the class of graphs with treewidth at most k.

· (path) = 3 [12]
· (tree) = 4 [7]
· 7 (outerplanar) 12 [2]
· (twk) 4k [9]
· 11 (planar  tw3) (planar) 768 [5, 4]
Other types of coloring, namely proper coloring and star coloring [1], are defined by forbidding only squares of period 1 and squares of period 1 and 2, respectively. The corresponding chromatic numbers  and s thus satisfy (C) s(C) (C) for every graph class C.
This paper investigates another variation of non-repetitive coloring, suggested by Grytczuk, such that only large enough squares are forbidden. The parameter k(G) is the minimum number of colors needed to color G such that no squares of period at least k appears in G. We similarly define k(C) for a graph class C, so that (C) = 1(C) 2(C) 3(C) · · ·
The case of words, i.e. infinite paths, is already settled
Theorem 2.
· k(path) = 3 for 1 k 2 [12]
· k(path) = 2 for k 3 [6]
We settle the case of trees in Section 2.
Theorem 3.
· 1(tree) = 4
· k(tree) = 3 for 2 k 4
· k(tree) = 2 for k 5
We also obtain a lower bound for planar graphs in Section 3.
Theorem 4. for every fixed k, k(planar  tw3) 11.
This disproves a conjecture of Grytczuk [8] that k(planar) = 4 for some k.

2 Trees

Colorings of trees have been considered [11] that minimize the critical ex-

ponent of repetitions. To avoid large squares, and for the same reasons as

in [11], we can assume without loss of generality that our colored tree is

rooted and that all the vertices at the same distance to the root have the

same color. So we only need to describe the word w lying on one branch

of the tree. We adopt the counter-intuitive convention that the reading di-

rection of w goes towards the root. Then every factor f s of w with |s| = 1

should be such that f sf R (where f R is the reverse of f ) avoids the forbidden

large squares. Let w3 be any infinite

7+ 4

-free ternary word.

We obtain w by taking the image of any

7+ 4

-free ternary word by the

following morphisms.

We use the 12-uniform morphism g2 to prove 2(tree) 3 and the 21uniform morphism g5 to prove 5(tree) 2:

g2(0) = 011220012201 g2(1) = 122001120012 g2(2) = 200112201120

g5(0) = 001101110001010110010 g5(1) = 001101110001001110101 g5(2) = 001101110001001101010

A word u is d-directed if for every factor f of u of length d, the word f R
is not a factor of u. To prove that a word is d-directed, it suffices to check its factors of length d. A word is (+, n)-free if it contains no repetition
with exponent strictly greater than  and period at least n. To prove the (+, n)-freeness, we use the method described in [10]. This way, we obtain
the following.

· g2(w3) is 3-directed and

19 10

+,

2

-free.

· g5(w3) is 20-directed and

83 42

+,

5

-free.

Consider g2(w3). For contradiction, suppose that g2(w3) contains a factor

f s with |s| = 1 such that the word f sf R contains a square of period p 20.

Since f sf R is a palindrome, we can assume that the center of the square is

on the left of s. Since f s is

19 10

,

2

-free, f s must contain (as a suffix)

a

prefix

of

this

square

of

length

at

least

p+1

and

at

most

19 10

p.

So

sf R

must

contain (as a prefix) a suffix x of this square of length at most p and at least

3. Because of the square, x appears both in f s and sf R. Notice

that (f s)R = sf R, so that f s contains both x and xR. This is a contradiction

since |x| 3 and f s is 3-directed. Finally, an exhaustive computer check

shows that the words f sf R contain no square of period p with 2 p 19.

The proof for g5(w3) is similar.

3 Planar graphs
We start with helpful results.
Lemma 5. (planar  tw3) (outerplanar) + 4
Proof. Let H be an outerplanar graph such that (H) = (outerplanar). We construct a planar graph G as follows. We start with a matching a1b1, a2b2, · · · , a1000b1000. For every vertex x in this matching, we add a copy Hx of H and we make x adjacent to every vertex of Hx. Finally we add two adjacent vertices c and d and we make them adjacent to every vertex in the matching.
For contradiction, suppose that (G) (H) + 3 and let m be a nonrepetitive coloring of G using the alphabet A = {1, 2, · · · , (H) + 3}. Since (H)+3 15, two edges of the matching get the same colors. Without loss of generality, m(a1) = m(a2) = 1 and m(b1) = m(b2) = 2. We can also assume that m(c) = 3 and m(d) = 4. Let u be a vertex in Ha1. Because of the edge uai, m(u) = 1. Also m(u) = 3, since otherwise the path ua1ca2 would create the square 3131. Symmetrically, m(u) = 4. Thus m(Ha1)  A \ {1, 3, 4}. Since |A\{1, 3, 4} | = (H), there exists a vertex u in Ha1 such that m(u) = 2. By swapping the roles of colors 1 and 2 in the argument above, we deduce that there exists a vertex v in Hb1 such that m(u) = 1. Now the path ua1b1v creates the square 2121, which is a contradiction.
Lemma 6. Let k be a fixed integer and let P be a path. In every proper coloring of P avoiding squares of period at least k, every subpath of P with 4k vertices contains at least 3 colors.
Proof. A proper 2-coloring of the path of 4k vertices contains the square (01)2k of period 2k. So at least 3 colors are needed to avoid squares of period at least k.
Lemma 7. For every fixed k, there exists an outerplanar graph that admits no proper 5-coloring avoiding squares of period at least k.

Proof. Our outerplanar graph G has a root vertex and vertices at distance i from the root are said to be on level i. A vertex on level i + 1 has exactly one neighbor on level i. The neighborhood on level i + 1 of vertex on level i induces a very long path. Finally, G contains 10k levels.
For contradiction, suppose that G has a proper 5-coloring avoiding squares of period at least k using the colors {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. Without loss of generality, the root (on level 0) is colored 0. Without loss of generality, the very long path on level 1 contains two non-intersecting occurrences of a long factor of the form w1. Now we consider the very long path on level 2 adjacent to the suffix letter 1 of the rightmost occurrence of w1. It does not contain color 0, since otherwise we would have the long square w10w10 such that the first 0 is the root and the second 0 is on level 2. So it must be colored with the remaining colors {2, 3, 4}. By Lemma 6, each of the three colors in {2, 3, 4} are recurrent in our very long path. In particular, it contains two non-intersecting occurrences of a long factor of the form z2. On level 3, below the suffix letter 2 of the rightmost occurrence of z2, the very long path does not contain color 2, since otherwise we would have the long square z21z21. So this very long path on level 3 must be colored with letters {0, 3, 4}.
Continuing this line of reasonning leads to the existence of a downward path from the root such that the vertex on level i is colored i (mod 5). So G contains the long square (01234)2k.
We define the sequence Gi of planar triangulations with treewidth 3 such that G0 is K4 and Gi+1 is obtained by adding a vertex of degree 3 in every face of Gi.
let us give some properties of the sequence of Gi.
Lemma 8. If xy is an edge of Gi, then x and y are adjacent to every vertex of a path on t vertices in Gi+t. Moreover, Gi and this path have an empty intersection.
We define the sequence Ui of outerplanar graphs as follows:
· every graph Ui has exactly one main edge.
· U0 is K2.
· Ui+1 is obtained from a copy of Ui with main edge ab and a copy of Ui with main edge cd by identifying the vertices b and c and adding the edge ad. Then ad is the main edge of Ui+1.

It is not hard to check that every outerplanar graph is the subgraph of some graph Ui.
Lemma 9. If x is a vertex of Gi, then x is adjacent to every vertex of a copy of Ut in Gi+t+2. Moreover, Gi and this copy of Ut have an empty intersection.
We are ready to prove Theorem 4. For contradiction, suppose that q is the smallest integer such that all the Gi's can be colored with 10 colors such that the period of every square is at most q. By Lemma 8, we can assume that the 10-coloring is proper and we use the alphabet A10 = {0, · · · , 9}.
Recall the (outerplanar) 7 [2]. Using Lemma 5, we obtain (planar  tw3) 11. Let W be a witness of this lower bound. Then every proper 10coloring of a graph Gi that contains W must contain a square with period at least 2. This shows that q 2.
By definiton of q, there exists j such that every proper 10-coloring of Gj contains a square of period q. By permuting the colors, we can assume that this square is S = 0 · · · 10 · · · 1 where |0 · · · 1| = q. By Lemma 8 and Lemma 6, there exists a such that in Gj+a, the endpoints of the edge colored 10 at the center of S are adjacent to a path containing 3 different colors. These 3 colors are distinct from 0 and 1. So without loss of generality, Gj+a contains the three words of the form Fx = 0 · · · 1x0 · · · 1 with x  {2, 3, 4}.
By Lemma 9 and Lemma 7, there exists b such that in Gj+a+b, the vertex colored 1 that is the common suffix of the words Fx is adjacent to an outerplanar containing 6 different colors. Let Q6  A10 be the set of these 6 colors. First, 1  Q6 because the coloring is proper. If there exists x  Q6  {2, 3, 4}, then Gj+a+b would contain the square Fxx = 0 · · · 1x0 · · · 1x with period q + 1. That would contradict the minimality of q, so Q6  {2, 3, 4} = . Therefore, Q6 = {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Since 0  Q6, Gj+a+b contains the overlap 0 · · · 10 · · · 10.
We have seen that the square with period q and length 2q in Gj+a extends to one letter to right in Gj+a+b to give the overlap with period q and length 2q + 1. Similarly, the suffix of length 2q of this overlap in Gj+a+b is again a square that extends to an overlap in Gj+2(a+b). So Gj+2(a+b) contains a repetition with period q and length 2q + 2. By induction, Gj+2q(a+b) contains a repetition with period q and length 4q. This repetition in Gj+2q(a+b) is a fourth power with period q and thus a square with period 2q. Finally, this contradicts the minimality of q.
