arXiv:2106.00144v1 [eess.SY] 31 May 2021

Abstract--Current contingency reserve criteria ignore the likelihood of individual contingencies and, thus, their impact on system reliability and risk. This paper develops an iterative approach, inspired by the current security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) practice, enabling system operators to determine risk-cognizant contingency reserve requirements and their allocation with minimal alterations to the current SCUC practice. The proposed approach uses generator and transmission system reliability models, including failure-to synchronize and adverse conditions, to compute contingency probabilities, which inform a risk-based system reliability assessment, and ensures reserve deliverability by learning the response of generators to post-contingency states within the SCUC. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using the Grid Modernization Lab Consortium update of the Reliability Test System.
I. INTRODUCTION
Reliable power system operation requires procurement of contingency reserves to respond to any unplanned outages of generation or transmission equipment. Current approaches determine these requirements using deterministic security margins that (i) ignore the likelihood of potential contingencies and (ii) are defined in terms of system-wide or zonal quantities that trivialize deliverability of the scheduled reserves in post-contingency system states. As a result, these methods are unable to trade-off the risk of potential nodal power balance or flow limit violations against the cost of reserve provision and allocation. Integrating contingency analyses and risk-based calculations for power system short-term planning purposes ­ typically centered around solving an instance of the security-constrained unit commitment problem (SCUC) ­ is computationally demanding. This paper develops an iterative approach, inspired by the current SCUC practice, that enables system operators to determine dynamic contingency reserve requirements and their allocation in a risk-aware manner with minimal alterations to the current SCUC practice.
Current practices for contingency reserve provision are adapted from reliability security standards, e.g., in the U.S. from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) [1]. Here, the minimum amount of reserve is set to comply with given standards (e.g., BAL-002-2 for the U.S.) [2], that is to withstand the most severe single contingency (i.e., "N-1 criterion"). U.S. system operators adhere to this minimal requirement with some modifications or extensions, which are typically static policies adjusted to a desired level of security in the system [3]. For example, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) require the total contingency reserve to cover the largest credible contingency and additionally constrain how different types of reserves (e.g., spinning

and non-spinning, demand-side resources) contribute to the total amount [4], [5]. Similarly, Independent System Operator New England (ISO-NE) and the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) procure spinning and non-spinning contingency reserves to cover the largest contingency within 10 minutes. Additional 30-minute reserves must cover another 50 % of the second largest contingency at ISO-NE, or together with the 10-minute reserves account for 150 % of the largest contingency at NYISO. See [6], [7].
Although such minimal reserve requirements should cover the worst-case contingency (and, thus, implicitly less severe contingencies), they are typically scheduled by optimizing a pre-contingency system state, i.e., assuming normal operation alone. Therefore, they may not be deliverable in postcontingency system states due to system limits (e.g., congestion). Some ISOs ensure reserve deliverability implicitly by enforcing zonal reserve criteria and approximate inter-zonal exchange capacities [8]. However, statically defined zones with typically long update intervals, e.g., yearly or quarterly [8], may not reflect the actual system state and scheduled reserves may not be deliverable due to interzonal congestion. Additionally, pre-defined zonal reserve requirements produce suboptimal generator dispatch solutions [9]. Ideally, postcontingency reserve deliverability should be endogenous to the SCUC optimization. However,this would lead to computationally intractability, even if only "N-1" outages are considered [10]. To alleviate this complexity in practice, heuristics and approximate approaches are often used. For example, [11] uses a simplified security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED) formulation with fixed zonal load shift factors to model power flow changes caused by severe outages. However, this approach relies on fixed zones and ignores potential intrazonal congestion. A similar approach is implemented by CAISO [12] using predefined generation distribution factors to estimate post-contingency power flows using the generator parameters providing frequency response services. While [11], [12] approximate post-contingency power flows, the underlying shift factors do not consider individual post-contingency system states explicitly, which reduce their applicability for varying system conditions. On the other hand, reserve activation factors, see e.g., [13], [14], that model how scheduled reserves are called upon under various post-contingency states improve reserve deliverability and reduce the cost of emergency corrective actions.
While considering transmission constraints and postcontingency system states, [11]­[16] neglects the probability of generator and transmission contingencies and therefore cannot assess risk imposed by the contingencies using costbenefit analyses. To internalize the trade-off between sys-

tem reliability and the cost of reserve provision, [17], [18] introduce approximations of reliability metrics, i.e., loss-ofload probability (LOLP) and expected energy not served (EENS), into the unit commitment problem. In [17], [18], instead of meeting a fixed total requirement, contingency reserves are scheduled with respect to a target LOLP or EENS. Alternatively, avoiding the selection of fixed LOLP or EENS targets, the cost of reserve provision and the expected cost of contingencies can be co-optimized by considering the value of lost load (VOLL) [19] in the objective of the SCUC formulation. For example, [20] proposes a piecewise linear approximation of the EENS to obtain a computationally tractable solution, and [21] applies scenario-based stochastic programming to co-optimize pre-contingency and expected post-contingency costs. However, [17]­[21] require significant modifications to the current SCUC practice in the industry, which is an adoption barrier. On the other hand, [22] proposes an offline optimization of reserve requirements, which could then be enforced in the SCUC optimization with minimal alterations, by jointly minimizing the system operating cost of a reduced system model and the penalized EENS. This method has also been extended to account for the failure of generators to synchronize [23] and wind uncertainty [24].
The notable limitation is that [17]­[24] do not consider deliverability of scheduled reserves, i.e., they do not consider transmission systems constraints in either pre- and postcontingency states. On the other hand, [25], [26] model a network-constrained SCUC, which minimizes the system cost and expected cost of load shedding, and endogenously compute probabilities of contingencies as a function of commitment decisions. While this approach addresses reserve deliverability and internalizes contingency risks, it significantly alters SCUC computation and introduces numerous auxiliary binary and non-binary variables that may obstruct computation for large-scale networks.
This paper proposes to account for risk-aware reserve dimensioning, allocation and deliverability in the close-to-reality SCUC framework by learning risk-aware reserve activation factors. These factors can be learned iteratively and capture the post-contingency system states and their reliability. Once obtained such factors can be used to effectively approximate post-contingency power flows in pre-contingency system optimization with minimal alterations to the original SCUC practice. In contrast to [13], [14], the proposed approach considers the probability of generator and transmission outages to enable risk-informed decision making. Further, instead of enforcing all post-contingency states in the SCUC formulation, the proposed approach selects worst-case contingencies by applying conditional value-at-risk computations to postcontingency power flows.
II. MODEL FORMULATION
In current ISO practice, SCUC is solved once to determine least-cost generator commitment and dispatch schedules with respect to technical generator and system constraints and security requirements, e.g., reserves. The resulting schedules are then tested against a predefined set of contingencies to ensure that potential overloads or power mismatches are

within acceptable range. If security requirements are violated, generator schedules are adapted using heuristic approaches. See also [27]. Figure 1 shows and overview of this current approach. Below we present the base SCUC and contingency analysis formulations, and discuss the required attributes for contingency reserves.

A. Base SCUC

where 1xX denotes the indicator function, which takes the value of 1 if x  X , and 0 otherwise. Objective (1a) minimizes

the system cost given by piecewise linear generator cost
functions defined in (1b), no-load costs Cg0, start-up costs CgSU and shut-down costs CgSD. Capacity limits of generators are
enforced in (1c) and (1d). Constraints (1e)­(1g) relate binary

variables ug,t, vg,t and wg,t that denote commitment, start-up

and shut-down decisions, respectively. Commitment changes

are restricted by minimum up- and down-time limits enforced

in (1e) and (1f). Note that it is sufficient to explicitly define

ug,t as binary in (1w), while vg,t and wg,t can be continuous within interval [0, 1] as in (1x). Renewable generation, e.g.,

grid-scale wind and solar power plants, is accounted for in set

W. Constraint (1j) ensures that generation pw,t of renewable
generator w is lower than its forecast availability pw,t, if generator w is dispatchable, i.e., w  WD, or equal to pw,t, if w is not dispatchable, i.e., w  WD. Constraints (1h)

and (1i) enforce generator ramping limits. The dc power flow

equations, reference bus definition and thermal power flow

limits are modeled as in (1k)­(1m). Eq. (1n) ensures the

nodal power balance by accounting for the generation/load

injections and power flows at all nodes. Finally, (1o)­(1v)

enforce contingency reserve requirements. Specifically, reserve

must cover at least the outage of the largest generator, (1q), or a fraction RD of system demand, (1p). In turn, reserve

consists of spinning and non-spinning portions, (1o), whereas spinning reserve must be at least RS times the total reserve. Common values for RS and RD are 50% and 7%, e.g., as in

the current CAISO practice [27]. However, other requirements

are possible [3] to accommodate specific risk attitudes of the

system operator. In the model of (1), only fast-start units (set GFS) are allowed to provide non-spinning reserve, (1t)­(1u),

and all reserves are limited by the short-term (10-min) ramp-

rate in (1u) and (1v).

B. Corrective Contingency Analysis The commitment, dispatch and reserve decisions obtained from (1) are then evaluated for feasibility using a set of credible contingency scenarios. Thus, each contingency scenario is indexed as c  C and sets Gc  G and Lc  L contain indices of generators and lines that are unavailable during contingency c. Next, the following optimization is solved for each contingency c:

is the set of generators that cannot be synchronized in real

time, e.g., within less than 10 minutes. For every time period

t, (2) re-dispatches available generators so that load shedding sLi,St,c and positive and negative transmission line overloads s+ij,t,c, s-ij,t,c are minimized as given by the objective function in (2a). Constraints (2b)­(2d) enforce power flow equations and limits for all available lines, i.e., ij  L \ Lc. In addition to potential line overloads s+ij,t,c and s-ij,t,c, the maximum thermal capacity of each line is set to its emergency rating fiEj  fimj ax, which can be maintained for a short period of time. Nodal power balance is enforced in (2f) with a possibility of load shedding sLi,St,c. Load shedding at each time t and bus i is limited by the nodal load Di,t as enforced in (2g).
Constraints (2h)­(2j) restrict the contingency dispatch by the

short-term ramping and output limits of each generator.

C. Deliverability of Reserves

Reserves allocated in (1) may not be deliverable under

specific contingency scenarios analyzed using the model in

(2) due to generation limits and network congestion. Such

instances are defined for contingency c when (2) returns tT iN sLi,St + tT ijL(s+ij,t,c + s-ij,t,c) > 0, i.e., the
loss of generators Gc and/or lines Lc can not be corrected by

the available reserves without overloading transmission lines

or load shedding. Alternatively, the base SCUC formulation in

(1) can be modified to endogenously ensure the deliverability

of reserves for every c  C. Formally, such a modification can

be written as

where (3b) and (3c) ensure that changes in power flow fij,t,c

due to contingency c can be accommodated by the system.

However, the implicit computation of fij,t,c, c  C and enforcing (3b) and (3c) c  C generally leads to computation-

III. RISK-AWARE RESERVE ALLOCATION
Current SCUC methods sued by real-world ISOs ignore the probability of individual contingency scenarios, which leads to commitment, dispatch and reserve decisions that misestimate risk exposure of the system and does not reflect actual system risk levels [22]. The risk associated with a contingency scenario can be estimated as the probability of this scenario times its severity. Notably, severity must be considered from the system perspective, i.e., it must capture the ability of the power system to remain in a stable operational state and continue serving the system load. For example, if it can be guaranteed that the loss of a generator can be safely compensated by available reserves, then this contingency poses no risk to system operation. A suitable contingency risk metric is the expected energy not served (EENS), i.e., the amount of unserved load after a contingency multiplied by the probability of that contingency. However, EENS computation requires evaluating possible post-contingency system states. Solving a one-shot SCUC with an internalized EENS-based risk evaluation is computationally demanding and requires a significant modification to the original SCUC formulation (e.g., see [25]), which is undesirable from the viewpoint of real-world ISOs as it reduces transparency, accountability and trustworthiness of the resulting decisions.
To enable a risk-aware reserve allocation process, it is critical to (i) ensure the reserve deliverability with a high probability and (ii) trade off the risk-adjusted cost and benefits of reserve procurement with minimal alterations to base SCUC practice, which has earned the trust of market participants. To this end, the iterative approach in Fig. 2 enhances the current practice to include risk adjustments accounting for different likelihoods of contingency scenarios.
Each iteration of the algorithm in Fig. 2 performs SCUC computation, contingency analysis and a risk analysis. The detailed process is itemized below where each step corresponds

to the circled numbers in Fig. 2:

1) Solve the base SCUC formulation in (1) with given reserve requirements.
2) Perform contingency analyses as in (2) for set C of credible contingencies. Additionally, this step different external disturbances such as extreme weather events and VRES fluctuations are considered.
3) Calculate the risk of all contingencies using a suitable risk metric, e.g., EENS, as computed in Section IV-E below. If the resulting risk level is below a given threshold , the process stops.
4) If the risk level is above , update the reserve activation factors and compute worst-case contingency probabilities as described in Sections III-A and III-C below.
5) Re-run the reserve-aware modification of (1) (ResASCUC) by additionally enforcing post-contingency power flow constraints as described in Section III-A below.
6) Repeat until a desired level of risk given by is achieved.

The following subsections describe the formulation and computations needed to accommodate the procedure in Fig. 2 within the current practice. To this end, we describe necessary, rather non-intrusive modifications to the base SCUC formulation in (1) to obtain the ResA-SCUC used in step (5) of the procedure in Fig. 2.

A. Reserve Activation Factors To internalize the effects of post-contingency reserve activation into the base SCUC formulate as in (3), we use reserve activation factors (RAFs) denoted as g,t,c. RAFs establish a functional connection between the scheduled reserves rg,t = rgS,t + rgN,St and corrective generation actions r^g,t,c = pg,t,c - pg,t. First, we consider reserve as a strictly positive corrective measure to respond to a credible generation contingency. Similarly to [14], we assume that the relationship between rg,t and r^g,t,c can be approximated by the following linear function:
r^g,t,c  f (g,t,c, rg,t) = g,t,crg,t, c  CG. (4)
Thus, if parameters g,t,c in (4) can be estimated accurately, they can be used to assure reserve deliverability for credible contingencies in the base SCUC formulation in (1) by adding the following set of constraints:

fij,t,c =

PTDF(ij)k

(5c)

where PTDF(ij)k is the power transfer distribution factor of

nodal power injections at bus k towards the active power flow

in transmission line ij.

In contrast to reserve activation during generation outages,

re-dispatch following credible transmission line contingencies

require both upward and downward flexibility of generators.

The amount of this flexibility available for reserve activation

depends on the commitment and dispatch capacity of gener-

ators, and therefore we compute it similarly to (4) using the

following relationship:

than regression-based approaches, such as in [14], because many RAFs g,t,c tend to be either 1 or to 0, see Section V-C below. Therefore, for generators that have consistent reserve activation factors g,t,c = 1 across iterations, regression approaches would lead to a slope of 0 and an intercept of 1.

outage distribution factors of tripped lines Lc towards line ij. The entries of (|Lc × 1|)-vector PTDFLck are the PTDFs of bus k towards lines Lc. See, e.g., [28].

We note that if a contingency scenario considers both

transmission and generation outages, then both Eqs. (5a) and

(7) must be added to the base SCUC formulation. Introducing

Eq. (5) and/or (7) to the base SCUC formulation in (1) makes it

possible to adjust reserve deliverability under different credible

C. Risk-Adjusted Reserve Deliverability

The iterative approach shown in Fig. 2 uses EENS as a

stopping criterion and is therefore risk-aware. However, for

all c  C and g,t,c = 0, the ResA-SCUC enforces postcontingency flow changes fij,t,c in a robust manner. That is, constraints (5b), (5c), (7c) and (7d) can be written as:

in Fig. 2, we refer to this modification of the base SCUC as reserve-aware SCUC (ResA-SCUC).

B. Learning Reserve Activation Factors

For every iteration k of the procedure proposed in Fig. 2, RAFs

only on the SCUC and contingency analyses results of the

Instead of enforcing post-contingency flows in a robust manner as in (11), contingency probabilities ck, c  C can be used for risk-aware decision making and for selecting a set of worst-case contingencies Ck. Note that contingency probabilities ck may change in between iterations because they depend on the generator commitment status. See Sections IV-A and IV-D below. The process of computing Ck is shown in Algorithm 1.
For each contingency, Algorithm 1 also returns an adjusted conditional probability ^c,k that captures the probability of contingency c under the condition that one of the worst-case contingencies occurs. As a result, ^c,k = 0, c  C \Ck. Now,

instead of enforcing (5b) and/or (7c) and (7d) for all c  C,

we can ensure feasibility of the -worst case expected power

Again, constraints (5c), (7c) and (7d) can brought in a risk-

aware form analogously. Note that this approach effectively

To compute the EENS in step 3) of the loop shown in Fig. 2 and the risk-adjusted post-contingency flows as outlined in Section III-C, we need to compute probability c of each contingency c  C. Below we outline the underlying generator reliability model to obtain these probabilities accounting for both adverse conditions and failure to synchronize and discuss the computation of c and EENS.

A. Generator Reliability A typical reliability metric is the forced outage rate (FOR), i.e., the relative frequency of a generator not being available when it should have been [23], [31]. Assuming that FOR is independent for every hour and that repair times are longer

than the mission time Tg, i.e. 1 to 24 hours, it has been shown

that the reliability of generator g can be modeled via its outage

replacement rate (ORR):

Tg

ORRg(Tg) =

qge-qgtdt = 1 - e-qgTg , (18)

0

where ORRg(Tg) is the probability of the unplanned unavail-

ability of generator g during mission time Tg with qg denoting

the FOR of that generator. In line with reliability models

of generators from previous studies, e.g., [22], [25], we set

Tg = 1 and obtain:

ORRg(Tg) = ORRg = 1 - e-qg .

(19)

Additionally, whenever a generator is starting up, i.e.,

switching between the on and off states, it may fail to

synchronize. As shown in [23], the reliability model in (18)

can be extended to consider this failure to synchronize as

follows:

Ag = (1 - qgs)(1 - ORRg)

(20)

Ug = 1 - (1 - qgs)(1 - ORRg),

(21)

where Ag denotes the probability that the generator suc-

cessfully synchronizes and is available, and Ug denotes the

probability that the generator is unavailable due to either

failed synchronization or an unexpected outage. Parameter qgs denotes the relative frequency of synchronization failures and can be estimated from historical data [23]. Using the

scheduling results from (1), we can compute the probability

of each generator g to be unavailable at time t as:

Ug,t = ug,t(1 - (1 - vg,tqgs)(1 - ORRg)),

(22)

where ug,t  {0, 1} and vg,t  {0, 1} are the commitment

and start-up decisions produced by the base SCUC model in

(1) and described in Section II-A. From (22), it follows that
(i) reliability of generator g has no impact on the probability, if g is not committed, i.e., ug,t = 0  Ug,t = 0, and (ii) if the generator is not starting up at time period t, the
probability that it is unavailable is equal to its ORR, i.e., vg,t = 0  Ug,t = ug,t ORRg.

B. Transmission Line Reliability

The reliability of transmission lines and other interconnecting

equipment, e.g., transformers, can be similarly captured via

their FOR qij and we define

ORRij = 1 - e-qij .

(23)

Assuming that the topology of the network is fixed throughout

the planning horizon of the SCUC model, transmission line reliability is independent of t such that:

Uij,t = Uij = ORRij , t  T .

(24)

C. Adverse Conditions

Adverse conditions, e.g., weather effects such as extreme cold

or heat, can negatively impact the reliability of generators and

transmission lines [32]. Equipment FORs, and subsequently

ORRs, can be modified to capture increased outage rates dur-

ing adverse weather conditions using the following statistical analysis. Let FgA denote the share of unexpected generator outages occurring during adverse conditions. Further, let Hg
denote the total number of times for which historical data of generator g is available and HgA the number of times at which conditions are considered adverse. As in [32], we can

use the following two-state model to adapt the generator FOR

qg to reflect FOR during normal operation conditions qgN and adverse operation conditions qgA as:

qgN =

qg

Hg

Hg - HgA

(1

-

FgA)

qgA=

qg

Hg HgA

FgA

(25)

ORRNg = 1 - e-qgN ,

ORRAg = 1 - e-qgA . (26)

Similar computations can be made for branch contingencies

as follows:

qiNj =

qij

Hij Hij - HiAj

(1

-

FiAj )

qiAj =

qij

Hij HiAj

FiAj

(27)

ORRNij = 1 - e-qiNj ,

ORRAij = 1 - e-qiAj . (28)

D. Contingency Probabilities

Probability c of each credible contingency can be calculated as:

c,t = c,t

(Ug,t + (1 - ug,t))

Uij ,

gGc

ijLc

(29)

where:

c,t =

(1 - Ug,t)

(1 - Uij). (30)

gG\Gc

ijL\Lc

The first term in (29), c,t, represents the probability of all generators and branches that are considered operational in C

to operate as intended. The second term in (29) captures the probability of all generators Gc to experience an outage. If

a generator is not committed at time period t, i.e., (Ug,t + (1 - ug,t)) = 1 as per (22), its reliability will not contribute
to the contingency probability. Lastly, the third term in (29) represents the outage probability of all branches Lc.

E. EENS Calculation

After solving contingency analysis (2) for each contingency

scenario c  C, we can calculate the EENS using load shed-

ding results sLi,St,c and contingency probabilities c,t computed in Section Section IV-D. This leads to:

EENSkc =

ck,t

sLi,St,c

(31)

tT

iN

EENSk =

ck,t

sLi,St,c,

(32)

cC tT

iN

where EENSc and EENSk capture the per-contingency and

total EENS during contingency k, respectively.

V. CASE STUDY
The case study uses the Grid Modernization Lab Consortium update of the Reliability Test System (RTS-GLMC) available at [33]. The RTS-GLMC system is a 73-bus network with 120 lines. Excluding hydro generation, it hosts 73 conventional generators (nuclear, coal, gas and oil), 29 utility-scale VRES plants (Wind and PV) and 31 small-scale rooftop PV units. Transmission line capacity has been reduced to 80 % and available generation from wind power plants has been reduced by 40 %, thus leading to the effective VRES penetration of  25 %. All calculations have been performed for a 24-hour planning period using the load and VRES time series for 06/20/2020. Table I summarizes the cases with different assumptions on the underlying contingencies and their treatment, which are compared in the case study below. For all cases we ran the iterative process until EENSk  10-8M wh with

The case study uses FORs qg for conventional generators as provided in the RTS-GLMC data set, while failure-tosynchronize rates qgs are taken from [23] and shown in Table II. To account for the effects of adverse weather conditions (cases `Robust-A' and `R10-A'), it is assumed that generators record 2 weeks per year of adverse conditions, i.e., HgA = 5 %. Relative failure rates during adverse conditions FgA are set to 40 % for all gas-fired plants, 20 % for all nuclear power plants, and 10 % for all oil- and coal-fired plants similar to [32]. Also, for cases `Robust-VRES' and `R10-VRES', we model wind farm outages. To estimate per-farm contingency probabilities, it is assumed that each wind farm consists of identical turbines each with a power rating of 5 MW. Under this assumption, each turbine has a FOR of 8 % [35], [36], which is used to generate a capacity outage probability table (COPT) for each farm. The COPT is then aggregated into four 25-percentile bins (quartiles) to calculate the expected lost capacity in each quartile as shown in Table III. As a result, each wind farm is considered as four separate N-1 outages with a capacity loss as given in Table III and an ORR of 25 %. Finally, due to the smaller scale and higher spatial distribution of PV systems, their unplanned full or partial outages never caused load shedding in our experiments.

A. Convergence and Performance The base SCUC was solved within 386 s. The average solve time for the analysis of each contingency was 0.14 s. The solution of the ResA-SCUC required an average of 669 s with a standard deviation of 558 s. We did not observe a clear correlation between the iteration number or the number of non-zero gk,t,c and the solve time of the ResA-SCUC.
Fig. 3 shows the resulting EENSk after each iteration k for all six cases in Table I . After iteration k = 0, EENSk is equal for all cases but `Robust-A' and `RA10-A' because the initial SCUC calculation is the same across these cases, which leads to the identical contingency analysis results. Notably, the presence of VRES outages (with suffix `-VRES') does not change the EENSk, that is the considered wind farm outages do not cause load shedding. In cases `Robust-A' and `RA10-A', EENSk is greater due to using qgA instead of qg for calculating ck.
With each iteration, the EENSk reduces until it converges to zero; however, this trend is not strictly monotonic EENS developments (e.g., see k = 1 to k = 2 in `RA10-A') because of the nonconvexity in (1) (i.e., binary variables). In all cases considered in Fig. 3, at most nine iterations are required. Case `Robust-VRES' terminates after k = 5 iterations, case 'RA10' ­ k = 7, case `RA10-VRES' ­ k = 8, and cases `Robust', `Robust-A' and `RA10-A' ­ k = 9. On average, the `RA10' cases result in greater EENSk values than their counterpart `Robust' cases, which is expected because the risk-adjusted flow correction in (15) only ignores some of the less risky contingencies.
B. Cost, Commitment and Reserve Analysis Fig. 4 shows the total generation cost for all cases. For k = 0, as discussed in Section V-A, the initial SCUC computation is identical for all cases leading to identical cost of 112.34 M$. As the value of EENSk increases to 0.5 MWh and 0 MWh, the operating cost increases for all cases. And Fig. 5 shows the resulting generator commitments for the `Robust' case in Fig. 5(a) and for the `R10' case in Fig. 5(b). The explicit depiction of the commitment schedules for the other cases is omitted for brevity and the insights obtained from the two cases that are shown can be transferred.
As the result of the iterative process, the total operating cost increases slightly ( 0.1 - 1%) as the SCUC solution deviates from the k = 0 commitment and dispatch to ensure reserve deliverability. Similarly to Section V-A, the non-monotonic

Cost [M$]

behavior of the total cost in some cases of Fig. 4, can be explained by the nonconvexity of the SCUC optimization. Furthermore, deviations from the k = 0 SCUC solution also affect the resulting commitment decisions. Thus, for example, Fig. 5 shows that both the `Robust' and the `R10' cases at hours 17 to 24 commit relatively expensive generators, while cheaper generators remain offline. In both cases, we observe that one gas-fueled generator is no longer for hours 1 through 22 without any additional commitments until hour 14 or 16, respectively. This indicates, that given the generator cost curves, the SCUC would have preferred to commit this generator instead of increasing the power level of other generators. However, in the ResA-SCUC, power injections from this generator lead to congestion effects that may obstruct reserve deliverability.
Fig. 6 itemizes the total average amount of reserve that is procured in the system for all cases and all iterations. The observed deviations from the k = 0 SCUC solution is very small (between -0.7 % and +2.2 %) and shows no strict correlation to the robustness of the solution, i.e., the the resulting EENSk, which indicates that reserve deliverability depends less on the total amount of procured reserves and more on the allocation of reserves in the system. For example, Fig. 7 shows how the allocation of total average hourly reserve changes from iteration k = 0 and final iteration k| EENSk  10-8M W h for cases `Robust' and `R10'. In both cases reserve at Bus 36 in the north eastern part of the network is reduced, while reserve at Bus 2 in the southern part of the network is increased. Additionally, in the `Robust' case reserve at Bus 62 is increased and decreased at Bus 3.

C. Reserve Activation Factors

Fig. 8 illustrates reserve activation factors gk,t,c from the 'Robust' case for three iterations (k  {0, 4, 9}, rows) and three

times steps (t  {6, 12, 18}, columns). Here, only these gk,t,c where for each g  G the value of gk,t,c is non-zero at least
once for any t  T , c  C, or iteration k. As a result, we see

that six contingencies c  {17, 19, 56, 67, 71, 72} are critical.

Note that the index of the contingency corresponds to the index

of the generator that is unavailable in that contingency. Most

values gk,t,c are either equal to one (18.75 % of all gk,t,c) or

VI. CONCLUSION
This paper proposed an iterative approach that allows system operators to internalize contingency risk into contingency reserve procurement. First, we demonstrate how reserve deliverability can be ensured in a standard SCUC formulation using a linear relationship between scheduled reserves and post-contingency power flows, which can be captured by

reserve activation factors that are learned over time. Next, we use generator and transmission reliability models to compute contingency probabilities, which inform a risk assessment of the system given its scheduled reserves by means of a suitable risk metric, i.e., expected energy not served. The proposed approach maintains computational tractability of the SCUC model and minimizes required modifications to the current SCUC practice, which streamlines its real-world adoption. Additionally, we have shown how contingency probabilities can be adapted to account for generator failure-to-synchronize and adverse weather conditions and demonstrated how the post-contingency power flows can be rendered risk-aware by selecting the set of worst-case contingencies for which reserve deliverability must be ensured. The usefulness of the proposed methodology has been shown by numerical experiments on a modified version of the Grid Modernization Lab Consortium update of the Reliability Test System.
