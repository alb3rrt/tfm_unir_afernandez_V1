## Abstract

We present new constraint qualification conditions for nonlinear semidefinite programming that extend some of the constant rank-type conditions from nonlinear programming. As an application of these conditions, we provide a unified global convergence proof of a class of algorithms to stationary points without assuming neither uniqueness of the Lagrange multiplier nor boundedness of the Lagrange multipliers set. This class of algorithm includes, for instance, general forms of augmented Lagrangian, sequential quadratic programming, and interior point methods. We also compare these new conditions with some of the existing ones, including the nondegeneracy condition, Robinson's constraint qualification, and the metric subregularity constraint qualification.
