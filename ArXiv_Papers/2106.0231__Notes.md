## Abstract

Transport inhibition via Anderson localization is ubiquitous in disordered periodic lattices. However, in crystals displaying only flat bands disorder can lift macroscopic band flattening, removing geometric localization and enabling transport in certain conditions. Such a striking phenomenon, dubbed inverse Anderson transition and predicted for three-dimensional flat band systems, has thus far not been directly observed. Here we suggest a simple quasi one-dimensional photonic flat band system, namely an Aharonov-Bohm photonic cage, in which correlated binary disorder induces an inverse Anderson transition and ballistic transport.
