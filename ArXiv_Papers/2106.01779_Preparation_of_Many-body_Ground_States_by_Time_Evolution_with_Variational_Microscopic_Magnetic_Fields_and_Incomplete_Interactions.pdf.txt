State preparation is of fundamental importance in quantum physics, which can be realized by constructing the quantum circuit as a unitary that transforms the initial state to the target, or implementing a quantum control protocol to evolve to the target state with a designed Hamiltonian. In this work, we study the latter on quantum many-body systems by the time evolution with fixed couplings and variational magnetic fields. In specific, we consider to prepare the ground states of the Hamiltonians containing certain interactions that are missing in the Hamiltonians for the time evolution. An optimization method is proposed to optimize the magnetic fields by "fine-graining" the discretization of time, in order to gain high precision and stability. The back propagation technique is utilized to obtain the gradients of the fields against the logarithmic fidelity. Our method is tested on preparing the ground state of Heisenberg chain with the time evolution by the XY and Ising interactions, and its performance surpasses two baseline methods that use local and global optimization strategies, respectively. Our work can be applied and generalized to other quantum models such as those defined on higher dimensional lattices. It enlightens to reduce the complexity of the required interactions for implementing quantum control or other tasks in quantum information and computation by means of optimizing the magnetic fields.

I. INTRODUCTION

How to efficiently and accurately obtain the desired states on quantum systems belongs to the fundamental topics in the fields of condensed matter physics, quantum simulation, quantum computation, and beyond. Taking the stronglycorrelated quantum systems as example, a class of states with non-trivial properties, such as quantum spin liquids with possible topological orders [1­4], can be reached by finding in nature or synthesizing the materials with the expected interactions, such as the antiferromagnets on two-dimensional lattices with geometrical frustration [5]. Usually, the target state is the ground or low-lying excited state of the Hamiltonian, thus can be reached by annealing [6].
With controllable parameters in the Hamiltonian, the state of a quantum system can be driven to a specific target by evolution (see an early work in Ref. [7] and a review in Ref. [8] as examples). For instance, a molecule can be driven to the desired state by designing a sequence of laser pulses optimized according to the fitness values from certain measurements on the state of the molecule [9, 10]. The optimization of the parameters of the time evolution can be formulated as the optimal control problems, which have been widely studied in, e.g., the interacting spins and solids [11­14]. Typical approaches for quantum control include solving the quantum brachistochrone equations to obtain the evolution to a target state with minimal time cost [15, 16].
In recent years, machine learning (ML) sheds new light on developing efficient protocols for state preparation and quantum control. One popular trend is to use the reinforcement learning, aiming at short, high-fidelity driving protocols or similar [17­25]. It has been proposed to adapt the ML models, such as deep neural networks, to generate or optimize the controlling parameters [26­29]. In particular, back propaga-

tion, an widely-applied numerical technique, has been applied to constructing large-scale quantum circuits for state preparation [30], speeding up the numerical simulations of optimal quantum control [31], and to other topics such as variational quantum eigen-solver [32] and tensor network simulations [33, 34].
In this work, we consider the preparation of the ground states of quantum many-body systems by the time evolution with fixed but incomplete interactions and variational magnetic fields. We assume that the Hamiltonian for the time evolution does not contain all the interaction terms in the Hamiltonian that gives the ground state as our target. The fine-grained time optimization (FGTO) algorithm is proposed by "fine-graining" the discretization of time, i.e., by gradually increasing the allowed maximal frequency of the timedependent magnetic fields. The negative logarithmic fidelity is minimized by optimizing the fields with gradient descent. We utilize the back propagation technique to obtain the gradients of the fields. The flowchart to illustrate the FGTO is given in Fig. 1.
To benchmark FGTO, we consider to prepare the ground state of the Heisenberg model by the time evolution with the XY or Ising interactions in the space- and time-dependent

magnetic fields. Note the Heisenberg model contains the twobody interactions along the three spin directions, while the XY and Ising models contain only the interactions in one or two spin directions. The FGTO is compared with two baseline methods where local and brutal-force global optimizations of the magnetic fields are implemented, respectively. FGTO achieves the highest preparation precision among these three methods. Numerical results are provided to show how the precision varies with the total evolution time and the fineness of the time discretization.

II. GENERAL SCHEME OF TIME-EVOLUTION STATE PREPARATION

We consider the preparation of the state |tar by the time evolution of the Hamiltonian

H^ (t) = H^mn +

hn (t)S^n .

(1)

m,n

n =x,y,z

with S^n the spin operator on the n-th site and hn(t) the magnetic fields at time t. We take the two-body interaction terms in the form of H^mn = =x,y,z J S^m S^n, where the coupling constants J are assumed to be time-independent.
Our goal is to obtain the optimal magnetic fields hn(t) that minimize the distance between the target state |tar and the
evolved state

|(T ) = U^ (T )|0 ,

(2)

with U^ (T ) formally denoting the time evolution operator determined by H^ (t), |0 the initial state, and T the total evolution time. The distance can be characterized by the negative
logarithmic fidelity (NLF) per site as

with N the total number of the spins. In practice, we discretize the total time T to K identical
slices, and the evolved state can be approximated as

III. FINE-GRAINED TIME OPTIMIZATION

method and  the learning rate controlled by the Adam

optimizer[35]. F is also called the loss function. However,

our simulations show that this optimization problem possesses

many local minimums. Consequently, the results might be sensitive to the initial values of hn,k. Therefore, the initialization strategy becomes crucial.

We propose the fine-grained time optimization (FGTO) al-

gorithm (Fig. 1). To begin with, we set K = 1 in the first iteration  = 1, meaning we do not allow hn,k( = 1) (note k = 1 and n = 1, · · · , N ) to change in the whole evolution. The optimal values of hn,k( = 1) are reached by implementing the gradient optimization using Eq. (5) for sufficiently

many times.
After hn,k( = 1) converges, we "fine-grain" the time discretization by increasing K to 2K for the iteration of  = 2. The magnetic fields are initialized as hn,k( = 2) = hn,1( = 1) for k = 1 and 2. For the iteration of  > 2,
we initialize the magnetic fields according to those obtained in the ( - 1)-th iteration as hn,2k -1() = hn,2k () = hn,k ( - 1), which are subsequently updated by the gradient optimization.

To compare with, we also try another two optimization al-

gorithms as the baselines. The first is dubbed as sliced time
optimization (STO), where hn,k are optimized slice by slice from k = 1 to K. The idea is to minimize the loss func-

tion for every time slice. In the optimization of the k-th slice, hn,k for k < k are fixed as the values obtained in the former iterations. The fields in the k-th time slice hn,k are optimized by minimizing the distance between the target state

and the evolved state at t = k . The loss function reads

Fk

=

-

1 N

ln |

tar|(k )

|.

The other method is dubbed as global time optimization

(GTO), where we just iteratively compute the loss of |(T ) in Eq. (3), and update hn,k for all k = 1 to K simultaneously. Compared with the GTO, the STO is a more economic

method since in each iteration, we only need to deal with the

computational graphs of the automatic differentiation for the hn,k in a single time slice. For the FGTO, one can see that we in fact use GTO to update hn,k with a smaller or (eventually) equal number of time slices.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

To show the validity of the state preparation by time evolution, we choose the target state |tar as the ground state of the 1D Heisenberg model (HM) with the Hamiltonian

N -1

H^HM =

S^nS^n+1,

(6)

n=1 =x,y,z

where we take the number of spins N = 10 as example. Its ground state is a spin liquid with no magnetic ordering. For the Hamiltonian to implement time evolution, we choose the XY model and quantum Ising model (QIM) as examples,

Our aim is to see by tuning the magnetic fields, how accurately the time evolution by H^XY(t) or H^QIM(t) can prepare the ground state of H^HM, with the fact that some coupling terms in H^HM are missing in H^XY(t) or H^QIM(t).
Fig. 2 demonstrates the F by increasing the number of time slices K. For K = 1, meaning the magnetic fields are not allowed to vary with time, we have a large NLF F 3. By increasing K, we allow to change the magnetic fields more frequently. F drops fast with K and approximately converges at about K = 32. Note the target state |tar and the initial state |(0) is almost orthogonal to each other with the NLF F 60. This is partially because that the fidelity usually decreases exponentially with the number of qubits N and we take N 1.
In Fig. 3, we show the F versus the total evolution time T by fixing K = 16 using STO, GTO, and FGTO. By taking a small T , say T 0.3 (with fixed K = 16 still), the NLF drops to F 4.4 using FGTO. By increasing T , meaning the system will be evolved for longer time in each time slice, F further drops to F 1.278, 0.201, and 0.055 using STO, GTO, and FGTO, respectively, for T = 6. FGTO obtains the best precision among these three methods. In other words, FGTO permits the evolution to the target state in the shortest time, in order to reach a same fidelity.

The magnetic fields in the evolution Hamiltonian are taken as those optimized by the FGTO with T = 6. Interesting, we observe that F (t) does not monotonously decrease with t. A slight and smooth increase of F (t) appears for about t = 3. Such increase might indicate the escaping from the local minimum, which results in a lower F compared with that obtained by the GTO algorithm.
To demonstrate how the evolved state approaches the target state with the optimization in FGTO, Fig. 4 gives the F

at different optimization epochs. In specific, we start with K = 1 time slice. The magnetic fields are optimized for 200 epochs and afterward we fine-grain the time discretization by increasing K to 2K. In total, we implement 1000 epochs and eventually have K = 16 time slices. The total evolution time is fixed to be T = 4.5.
Our results show that not just the XY model but also the Ising model with only the interactions along the spin-z direction can be used as the evolution Hamiltonian to prepare the ground state of the Heisenberg model. We speculate that any Hamiltonian that can entangle the whole system by time evolution could be used as the evolution Hamiltonian for state preparation. As the magnetic fields correspond to single-body operators and cannot produce any entanglement, the coupling terms (two-body in our examples) with fixed strength are to entangle the system, and the magnetic fields are to drive the entangled state to the target. By introducing more interaction terms in the evolution Hamiltonian, such as the Heisenberg model that contains the interactions along all the three spin directions, one could obtain higher precision with the same total evolution time and number of time slices. We expect higher precision by using the evolution Hamiltonian that can entangle the system in higher speed, such as those with proper longer-range or multi-body interactions.
Fig. 5 demonstrates the space-and-time landscapes of the magnetic fields in three directions, obtained by the FGTO methods. We take the XY model as the evolution Hamiltonian and the ground state of the Heisenberg model as the target. The color of the block at the n-th column and the k-th

In this work, we consider to prepare the ground states of quantum many-body systems by the time evolution with fixed spin couplings and tunable magnetic fields. We focus on the cases where the Hamiltonian for the controlled time evolution contains less interaction terms than the Hamiltonian that gives the ground state as the target. The fine-grained time optimization (FGTO) algorithm is proposed to gain high efficiency and stability. We test our proposal by preparing the ground state of the Heisenberg model with the time evolution by only the XY or Ising interactions. FGTO achieves high fidelity compared with two baseline methods using local and global optimization strategies, respectively. Our work can be readily generalized to the preparation of not just the many-body ground states, but also the states constructed by hand for the purposes of realizing non-trivial physical properties or implementing the tasks of quantum communication and computation.
From the theoretical perspective, it is interesting and important to study the completeness. Usually, it is difficult to adjust or control the interaction terms in the quantum manybody systems. The interactions appearing in the materials or simulators at hand might suffer strict restrictions on, e.g., the interaction form or range. Our work shows the generality of using restricted interactions for state preparation. It is an open and important issue to investigate and characterize the set of classes reachable by the time evolution with the given interactions. By modifying the loss function, our work can be used to prepare the states the possess certain desired physical properties such as those with high entanglement [36­39]. Our idea can also be generalized with the non-Hermitian time evolution [40].
