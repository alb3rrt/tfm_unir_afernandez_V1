ON THE EMBEDDING OF LEFT-SYMMETRIC ALGEBRAS INTO DIFFERENTIAL PERM-ALGEBRAS
P. S. KOLESNIKOV AND B. K. SARTAYEV
Abstract. Given an associative algebra satisfying the left commutativity identity abc = bac (Perm-algebra) with a derivation d, the new operation a  b = ad(b) is left-symmetric (pre-Lie). We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a left-symmetric algebra to be embeddable into a differential Perm-algebra.

1. Introduction

The class of left-symmetric algebras (also known as pre-Lie algebras) initially appeared in deformation theory and geometry ([7], [13], [19]). By definition, a left-symmetric algebra is a linear space with one bilinear multiplication satisfying the identity
(a, b, c) = (b, a, c),
where (a, b, c) = (ab)c - a(bc) is the associator. If, in addition, the right commutativity holds, i.e.,

(ab)c = (ac)b,

then such a system is known as a Novikov algebra. Novikov algebras appeared in formal variational calculus [6] and, independently, as a tool for studying Poisson brackets of hydrodinamic type [2]. The structure theory of Novikov algebras is well-developed, see, e.g., [14] and references therein.
For example, if A is an associative and commutative algebra with a derivation d then the same space A relative to the new product

a  b = ad(b), a, b  A,

(1.1)

is a Novikov algebra. As shown in [3], this example is generic: every Novikov algebra embeds into a differential commutative algebra. An alternative way to prove the latter is to apply the following observation: the free Novikov algebra Nov X generated by a set X embeds into the algebra ComDer X, d of differential polynomials in X [5], and it is easy to show [12] that every homomorphic image of Nov X also embeds into a commutative differential algebra.

In this paper, we study the class of left-symmetric algebras obtained from non-commutative differential algebras by means of the operation (1.1). Namely, if A is an associative algebra satisfying the identity of left commutativity abc = bac (i.e., A is a Perm-algebra) then for every derivation d on A the operation (1.1) turns A into a left-symmetric algebra A(d).
Let us call a left-symmetric algebra special if it can be embedded into a differential Perm-algebra via (1.1). Although Perm-algebras are very close to commutative ones, the description of the class of special left-symmetric algebras differs from that of Novikov algebras. The most important difference is that it is not a variety: a homomorphic image of a special left-symmetric algebra may not be special. We show the class of special left-symmetric algebras to be a quasi-variety. It is easy to see that every special left-symmetric algebra satisfies ((ax)y)b = ((ay)x)b and (x, ya, b) = (y, xa, b). The corresponding variety of SLS-algebras contains the class of special left-symmetric algebras and we find explicitly the set of quasi-identities defining special algebras within the SLS-algebras. Finally, we prove that the class of SLS-algebras is the smallest variety containing special left-symmetric algebras. The latter follows from the observation that the free SLS-algebra is special.
We believe that the same approach as developed in this paper will be useful for finding the complete list of special identities for Gelfand­Dorfman algebras. In that case (see [12]) the class of special algebras does form a variety, and it is known that there are two idependent identities of degree 4.
Throughout the paper, k is an arbitrary base field. We will use the following notations. If Var is a variety of algebras then Var X stands for the free algebra in Var generated by a set X. We will use the same symbol Var to denote the operad goverining the variety Var.
For example, if Com denotes the variety of associative and commutative algebras then Com X = k[X] is the ordinary polynomial algebra. By LSym we denote the variety of left-symmetric algebras, Nov  LSym stands for Novikov algebras, etc.
The class of pairs (A, d), A  Var, d is a derivation on A is also a variety denoted VarDer. The free algebra in VarDer generated by a set X is denoted VarDer X, d . Here we include d into the notation for convenience. As a Var-algebra, VarDer X, d is isomorphic to Var X() , where
X() = X  X  X  · · ·  X(n)  . . . ,
X(n) = {x(n) | x  X}, n  0, are disjoint copies of X. The derivation d acts on the generators of Var X() as d(x(n)) = x(n+1).
The interest to the study of differential Perm-algebras has one more motivation. The operad Perm plays a specific role in the theory of dialgebras [15] and their operads (called replicated operads) [8], [17]: given an operad Var, the Manin white product of operads PermVar is exactly the operad governing

ON THE EMBEDDING INTO DIFFERENTIAL ALGEBRAS

the class diVar of Var-dialgebras. Note that for Perm the Manin white product coincides with the Hadamard product of operads.
On the other hand, the operad Nov has its own distinguished role in the combinatorics of derivations on non-associative algebras [11]: given a binary operad Var, the Manin white product Nov  Var is the operad governing the class of derived Var-algebras. The latter are obtained from Var-algebras with a derivation d relative to the new operations

a  b = ad(b), a  b = d(a)b

(for each of binary products in Var, if there are more than one operation). In the problem we consider in this paper, Perm and Nov meet each other
since we have to study differential Perm-algebras. This is why the theory of dialgebras (especially, Novikov dialgebras) provides us with effective tools for studying speciality of left-symmetric algebras.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we recall the definition of a Var-dialgebra and prove an analogue of the embedding theorem from [3] for Novikov dialgebras. This is done in a routine way by means of the general methods described in [8] (see also [9]). Since every Novikov dialgebra is in particular a left-symmetric algebra, we obtain that an embedding of a left-symmetric algebra into a differential Permalgebra is equivalent to the embedding into a Novikov dialgebra. Section 3 is devoted to the study of the forgetful functor from diLSym to LSym. It turns out that the left adjoint functor has a very natural description: given an algebra A  LSym, we may define the structure of its universal enveloping left-symmeric dialgebra on the tensor algebra T (A). In Section 4, we prove that the free SLS-algebra is special. Namely, the subalgebra of PermDer X, d generated by the set X relative to the operation a  b = ad(b) is isomorphic to the free left-symmetric algebra satisfying two identities of SLS-algebras mentioned above. In contrast to [5], we do not find the monomial basis of SLS X , but still we can describe its linear basis explicitly as a subset of PermDer X, d . Finally, in Section 5 we derive the necessary conditions of speciality for an SLS-algebra in the form of quasi-identities. Then we prove that these conditions are also sufficient. Given an SLS-algebra A, we construct an appropriate quotient of its universal enveloping diLSym-algebra constructed in Section 3 to get a Novikov dialgebra envelope of A. The results of Section 2 then lead us to the desired conclusion. It is easy to construct examples of non-special SLS-algebras, however, the free SLS-algebra is special (Section 4). Hence, the class of special left-symmetric algebras does not form a variety.

2. Novikov dialgebras and differential Perm-algebras

Let Perm denote the class of associative algebras satisfying the identity

xyz - yxz = 0.

The operad governing the variety of such algebras is also denoted Perm. It

is clear (see [4]) that dim Perm(n) = n, and the composition rule is easy to

describe [10].

Given a binary quadratic operad O, the Hadamard product of operads O 

Perm coincides with the Manin white product [16], and the class of algebras

governed by O  Perm is known as the variety of di O-algebras (replicated

O-algebras [17], or O-dialgebras [10]). In particular, if Com and Lie denote

the operads governing commutative and Lie algebras then diCom and diLie

are isomorphic to Perm and Leib, respectively, where Leib is the operad of

Leibniz algebras.

If dim O(2) = 2 (one binary product with no symmetry) then the operad

di O is generated by two operations  and . The defining relations of di O

are easy to derive from those of O [10]. Namely, every di O-algebra satisfies

so-called 0-identities

(x1  x2)  x3 = (x1  x2)  x3, x1  (x2  x3) = x1  (x2  x3).

(2.1)

Moreover, for every multi-linear defining identity f (x1, . . . , xn) = 0 of O and for every i = 1, . . . , n one should claim

fi(x1, . . . , xn) = f (x1, . . . , x i, . . . , xn) = 0
to hold on di O. Here f (x1, . . . , x i, . . . , xn) is derived from f in the following way: in each nonassociative monomial (xj1 . . . xjn) the initial binary product is replaced with the products  and  so that the horizontal dashes point to the fixed variable xi.

Example 1. Let Nov stand for the variety of Novikov algebras as well as for the corresponding operad. Then diNov is defined by (2.1) together with

(x1  x2)  x3 - x1  (x2  x3) = (x2  x1)  x3 - x2  (x1  x3), (x1  x2)  x3 - x1  (x2  x3) = (x2  x1)  x3 - x2  (x1  x3),

(2.2)

(x1  x2)  x3 = (x1  x3)  x2, (x1  x2)  x3 = (x1  x3)  x2.

(2.3)

A linear space N equipped with bilinear operations  and  is a Novikov

dialgebra if and only if (2.1)­(2.3) hold for all x1, x2, x3  N .

Obviously, every Perm-algebra (diCom-algebra) with a derivation d turns into a Novikov dialgebra (diNov-algebra) relative to the new operations x

y = xd(y), x  y = d(y)x. The embedding statement may be derived by means of the general construction from [8] that allows us to reduce the problem on a Novikov dialgebra to an "ordinary" Novikov algebra by means of conformal algebras (pseudo-algebras). One may refer to [1] for details on pseudo-algebras, but for our puproses the only essential instance is that every pseudo-algebra may be turned into a dialgebra [10].

Theorem 1. Every Novikov dialgebra (N, , ) may be embedded into a differential Perm-algebra in such a way that
x  y = xd(y), x  y = d(y)x
for x, y  N.

Proof. If N is a Novikov dialgebra with operations  and  then
N0 = span {a  b - a  b | a, b  N } is an ideal in N and N¯ = N/N0 is a Novikov algebra. The space N is a Novikov bimodule over N¯ relative to the action
a¯  b = a  b, a  ¯b = a  b,
for a, b  N. The corresponding split null extension N^ = N¯  N is a Novikov algebra [18] in which N  N = 0.
Let H be a cocommutative bialgebra with a primitive element T (e.g., H = k[T ]). Consider the current pseudo-algebra CurN^ = H  N^ . Then CurN^ is a Novikov dialgebra relative to the operations
(f  x)  (g  y) = (f )g  x  y, (f  x)  (g  y) = (g)f  x  y
for x, y  N^ , f, g  H, where  is the counit in H. The dialgebra N embeds into CurN^ via
a  a^ = 1  a¯ + T  a, a  N.
Let (B, ·, d) be a commutative differential algebra which contains N^ in such a way that
x · d(y) = x  y, x, y  N^ .
Then C = CurB may be considered as a commutative dialgebra (i.e., Permalgebra) and it is easy to check that d^ = id  d is a derivation of C. Thus we have
N  CurN^  CurB = C,
and it is easy to check that the operations ,  on N are related with the operations ·, d^ on C in the desired way. Indeed, if a, b  N, a^, ^b  CurN^ then

6

P. S. KOLESNIKOV AND B. K. SARTAYEV

the product of d^(^b) and a^ in the Perm-algebra C may be calculated as follows:

d^(^b)a^ = (1  d(¯b) + T  d(b))(1  a¯ + T  a) = 1  d(¯b) · a¯ + T  d(¯b) · a) = 1  (a¯  ¯b) + T  (a  ¯b) = 1  a  b + T  (a  b) = a  b.

In a similar way, a  b = a^d^(^b) in C for all a, b  N.

Corollary 1. A left-symmetric algebra (A, ) embeds into a differential Perm algebra in such a way that a b = ad(b) for a, b  A if and only if (A, ) embeds into a Novikov dialgebra in such a way that a  b = a  b for a, b  A.

3. Universal enveloping left-symmetric dialgebras
According to the general rule of constructing defining identities of dialgebras, every left-symmetric dialgebra (A, , ) is a left-symmetric algebra relative to the operation . Thus we have a forgetful functor diLSym  LSym. In this subsection, we explicitly construct its left adjoint functor D : LSym  diLSym which will be applied in the sequel.
Let (A, ) be a left-symmetric algebra. Consider the (associative) tensor algebra T (A) of the space A (without the identity):
T (A) = A  A2  A3  . . . .

We will write a1 . . . an for the element a1  · · ·  an  An for brevity. Define the map M : T (A)  A as follows:

M (a1 . . . an) = ((. . . ((a1  a2)  a3)  . . . )  an), ai  A.

Let us define a binary operation  on the space T (A) by induction on the length of the second factor:

u  a = M(u)  a, u  T (A), a  A, u  (wa) = (u  w)a + w(M(u)  a) - wM(u)a,

(3.1)

for u, w  T (A), a  A. Finally, define a binary operation  on T (A) as

u  w = uM(w), u, w  T (A).

(3.2)

Lemma 1. For every u, w  T (A) we have

u  w = M(u)  w, u  w = u  M(w),

M(u  w) = M(u  w) = M(u)  M(w).

ON THE EMBEDDING INTO DIFFERENTIAL ALGEBRAS

Proof. The desired equalities are obvious for the operation , as well as for w = a  A. Proceed by induction on the length of w:

M(u  wa) = M(u  w)  a + M(w)  (M(u)  a) - (M(w)  M(u))  a = (M(u)  M(w))  a - (M(w), M(u), a) = M(u)  (M(w)  a) = M(u)  M(wa)
by the left symmetry.
Proposition 1. For every left-symmetric algebra (A, ), the space T (A) equipped with the operations (3.1), (3.2) is a left-symmetric dialgebra.
Proof. It is enough to check that (2.1) and (2.2) hold on (T (A), , ). Let us start with (2.1). Consider u, v, w  T (A) and note that

(u  v)  w = M(u  v)  w
= (M(u)  M(v))  w = M(u  v)  w = (u  v)  w
by Lemma 1. The remaining 0-identity holds by similar reasons. Next, proceed to (2.2). Let us state the calculation for the more complicated
case: show that the "right" associator
(u  v)  w - u  (v  w)
is symmetric relative to the exchange of u and v. Indeed, for w = c  A it is enough to apply Lemma 1 and the left symmetry of A. For the general case, apply induction on the length of w. Since we may replace u and v with M(u) and M(v) by Lemma 1, consider u = a, v = b (a, b  A):

(a  b)  wc - a  (b  wc) = ((a  b)  w)c + w((a  b)  c) - w(a  b)c - a  ((b  w)c + w(b  c) - wbc) = ((a  b)  w)c + w((a  b)  c) - w(a  b)c - (a  (b  w))c - (b  w)(a  c) + (b  w)ac - (a  w)(b  c) - w(a  (b  c)) + wa(b  c) + (a  wb)c + wb(a  c) - wbac.
Let us remove those summands that already form symmetric expressions (relative to the exchange of a and b) and expand the last (a  wb):

- w(a  b)c - (b  w)(a  c) + (b  w)ac - (a  w)(b  c) + wa(b  c) + (a  w)bc + w(a  b)c - wabc + wb(a  c) - wbac
= (a  w)bc + (b  w)ac - (a  w)(b  c) - (b  w)(a  c) + wa(b  c) + wb(a  c) - wbac - wabc.

The expression obtained has the desired symmetry. The remaining relation from (2.2) can be proved in a similar but simpler
way.
Denote the left-symmetric dialgebra (T (A), , ) by D(A). The injection  : A  D(A), (a) = a, is a homomorphism from A to D(A) = (D(A), ) by the definition.
Proposition 2. Let (A, ) be a left-symmetric algebra. Then for every leftsymmetric dialgebra B and for every homomorphism  : A  B there exists unique homomorphism of dialgebras  : D(A)  B such that  =  .
Proof. It is enough to check that the map
(a1a2 . . . an-1an) = (. . . ((x1  x2)  · · ·  xn-1)  xn), xi =  (ai), (3.3)
is a homomorphism of dialgebras preserving  and . The latter follows from the following observation: for all w  T (A), x  B we have
(w)  x =  (M(w))  x, x  (w) = x   (M(w))
by (2.1). It remains to prove
(a  w) =  (a)  (w), a  A,
by induction on the length of w  T (A), and apply Lemma 1.
Thus D(A) is the universal enveloping left-symmetric dialgebra of of a leftsymmetric algebra A. As we can see, every A embeds into its universal dialgebra envelope which is just T (A) as a linear space. The functor D(·) is left adjoint to the forgetful functor diLSym  LSym which is induced by the morphism of operads x1  x2  x1  x2.
Note that the same sort of functor acts on diNov: every Novikov dialgebra is in particular a left-symmetric algebra relative to the operation . So one may construct a universal enveloping Novikov dialgebra for a left-symmetric algebra A, but the problem is to distinguish those algebras that are embedded into such envelopes. We will completely resolve this problem in Section 5.

4. A linear basis of the free SLS-algebra

Let P be a Perm-algebra with a derivation d. As above, denote d(x) by x for x  P . A new binary operation

x  y = xy, x, y  P,

(4.1)

turns P into a left-symmetric algebra. Moreover, the following identities hold on P :

((x  y)  z)  u = ((x  z)  y)  u,

(4.2)

(x, y  z, u) = (y, x  z, u), ,

(4.3)

where (a, b, c) stands for the associator (a  b)  c - a  (b  c).

Definition 1. A left-symmetric algebra A satisfying (4.2) and (4.3) is said to be an SLS-algebra.

Let X be a nonempty set. In this section, we prove that the free SLS-algebra SLS X embeds into the free differential Perm-algebra PermDer X, d relative to the operation (4.1). Namely, define a homomorphism

 : SLS X  PermDer X, d

such that

 (x) = x, x  X,  (f  g) =  (f ) (g).

The main purpose of this section is to prove that  is injective. A Novikov algebra is in particular an SLS-algebra. Hence, there exists a
homomorphism  : SLS X  Nov X .
Choose a monomial basis N¯ in Nov X and for every u  N¯ choose its monomial pre-image in SLS X . Denote the set of such pre-images by N. There exists a monomial basis B of SLS X such that N  B. Let us choose and fix such a set B.
Every non-associative word u in X can be written as

u = L(u1, . . . , uk, x) := u1  (u2  (· · ·  (uk  x) . . . )),

(4.4)

where uj are non-associative words, x  X. Let k be the length of u. For a linear combination of (4.4), the length is the maximal length of its summands.

Lemma 2. Every element of SLS X may be written as a linear combination of words of the form (4.4) with uj  N , x  X.
Proof. It follows from (4.2) that if (a) = (b) then a  u = b  u for all a, b, u  SLS X . This observation makes the lemma obvious.

There exist various presentations of an element f  SLS X by linear combi-

nations of (4.4) as in Lemma 2. However, for every nonzero f we may choose a

presentation with minimal length. In this way, we obtain a well-defined length

function

 : SLS X \ {0}  Z+

which depends only on the choice of B.

Recall the notion of weight in a free commutative differential algebra [5]. Let X() stand for the disjoint union X  X  X  . . . , then ComDer X, d as a commutative algebra coincides with the polynomial algebra Com X() .

Define

wt(x(j)) = j - 1, x  X, j  0,

and set wt(uv) = wt(u) + wt(v) for all monomials u, v  Com X() .

10

P. S. KOLESNIKOV AND B. K. SARTAYEV

As shown in [5], the subspace W spanned in Com X() by all monomials of weight -1 is isomorphic to the free Novikov algebra Nov X relative to the map
Nov X  Com X()

defined in the same way as  . We will not distinguish notations for the maps presenting horizontal arrows in the diagram below.

SLS X ---  Perm X()









Nov X ---  Com X()
Hence, for every monomial u  W we may find its unique pre-image  -1(u)  Nov X , write  -1(u) as a linear combination of N , and consider the same combination as an element of SLS X since N  B. Thus we obtain a welldefined map  -1 : W  kN  SLS X which depends only on the choice of B.
If u  SLS X is a monomial of the form (4.4) then

 (u) =  (u1) (u2) . . .  (uk)x(k) + gu  Perm X()
where all monomials in gu end with x(j) for j < k. Recall that a linear basis of Perm X() consists of all monomials of the
form ux(j), where j  0, x  X, and u is from a linear basis of the free associative commutative algebra Com X() (see, e.g., [4]). In particular, associative words with different last letters are linearly independent in the free Perm-algebra.
Assume Ker  = 0 in SLS X . Choose a nonzero element f  Ker  of minimal length, (f ) = k. Without loss of generality we may suppose that all monomials in f in a presentation given by Lemma 2 end with the same letter x  X:
f = jL(u1j, u2j, . . . , ukj, x) + f~,
j
where (f~) < k or f~ = 0. Then

 (f ) = j (u1j) . . .  (ukj)x(k) + h,
j

where all monomials in h end with x(j) for j < k. Hence,

j (u1j) . . .  (ukj) = 0
j
in ComDer X, d = Com X() . The following statement leads us to a contradiction with the choice of f .

Proposition 3. Let

F = jw1j  · · ·  wkj  W k,
j
turn into zero by multiplication, i.e.,

j  k,

µ(F ) := jw1j . . . wkj = 0  Com X() .
j
Then (g) < k for g = jL(u1j, u2j, . . . , ukj, x),
j
where uij =  -1(wij), x  X.
Before we proceed to the proof, let us state two examples to explain the meaning of Proposition 3.
(1) F = w1  w2 - w2  w1  W 2 turns into zero by multiplication. Then for ui =  -1(wi)  kN  SLS X , i = 1, 2, we have
u1  (u2  x) - u2  (u1  x) = (u1  u2)  x - (u2  u1)  x
by left symmetry. The right-hand side is of length  1 which is smaller than k = 2. (2) F = w1  w2w3 - w2  w1w3  W 2 turns into zero by multiplication (here wi  W ). Then for ui =  -1(wi), we have ui  u3   -1(wiw3 ) (mod Ker ) by definition, and thus

 -1(w1)  ( -1(w2w3 )  x) -  -1(w2)  ( -1(w1w3 )  x) = u1  ((u2  u)  x) - u2  ((u1  u)  x) = (u1  (u2  u))  x - (u2  (u1  u))  x
by (4.3). The right-hand side is of length  1.

Proof. Suppose µ(F ) = 0 for F  W k. Then F may be presented as a linear combination of tensors of the form

w1  · · ·  wj-1  (ab  cd - cb  ad)  wj+1  · · ·  wk,

where wi, a, b, c, d are monomials in Com X() and all tensor factors are of weight -1.
It remains to note that

( -1(ab),  -1(cd), u) = ( -1(cb),  -1(ad), u)

(4.5)

holds in SLS X for all appropriate a, b, c, d  Com X() and for all u  SLS X . Since wt(ab) = wt(cd) = -1 and due to left-symmetry of an SLSalgebra, it is enough to consider the case when wt(a) = wt(c) = -1.

12

P. S. KOLESNIKOV AND B. K. SARTAYEV

Let x =  -1(a). It follows from the definition of  that for every b such that wt(b) = 0 the element  -1(ab) considered in Nov X is a linear combination of elements
R(x, u1, . . . , um) = (. . . ((x  u1)  u2)  . . . )  um, ui  N.
It follows from (4.2) that for every u  B we may write
 -1(ab)  u = R(x, u1, . . . , um)  u  SLS X
In a similar way, one may present  -1(cd) in Nov X as R(y, v1, . . . , vl). Then
( -1(ab),  -1(cd), u) = (R(x, u1, . . . , um), R(y, v1, . . . , vl), u),
( -1(cb),  -1(ad), u) = (R(y, u1, . . . , um), R(x, v1, . . . , vl), u). The right-hand sides of the last two relations are equal due to the identities of SLS-algebras.
Indeed, let us prove the identity
(R(x, u1, . . . , um), R(y, v1, . . . , vl), u) = (R(y, u1, . . . , um), R(x, v1, . . . , vl), u) (4.6)
by induction on m and l. If m = l = 0 then (4.6) coincides with left symmetry. Assume m = 0,
l > 0 and (4.6) is already proved for smaller l's. Then (4.3) together with left symmetry imply

(x, R(y, v1, . . . , vl), u) = (x, R(y, v1, . . . , vl-1)  vl, u)
= (R(y, v1, . . . , vl-1), x  vl, u) = (x  vl, R(y, v1, . . . , vl-1), u)
= (y, R(x  vl, v1, . . . , vl-1), u)
by induction. It remains to note that R(x  vl, v1, . . . , vl-1) may be replaced here with R(x, v1, . . . , vl-1, vl) by (4.2).
For m > 0, proceed in a similar way:

(R(x, u1, . . . , um), R(y, v1, . . . , vl), u) = (y, R(R(x, u1, . . . , um), v1, . . . , vl), u) = (y, R(x, u1, . . . , um, v1, . . . , vl), u) = (y, R(x, v1, . . . , vl, u1, . . . , um), u)
= (y, R(R(x, v1, . . . , vl), u1, . . . , um), u) = (R(x, v1, . . . , vl), R(y, u1, . . . , um), u) = (R(y, u1, . . . , um), R(x, v1, . . . , vl), u).
As a result,
L( -1(w1), . . . ,  -1(wj-1),  -1(ab),  -1(cd),  -1(wj+1), . . .  -1(wk), x) - L( -1(w1), . . . ,  -1(wj-1),  -1(cb),  -1(ad),  -1(wj+1), . . .  -1(wk), x)  L( -1(w1), . . . ,  -1(wj-1), ( -1(ab),  -1(cd), u) - ( -1(cb),  -1(ad), u)) (4.7)

modulo summands of smaller length, where u = L( -1(wj+1), . . .  -1(wk), x). The right-hand side of (4.7) is zero by (4.6).

Summarizing the exposition of the section, we may state

Theorem 2. For a nonempty set X, the subalgebra F generated by X in the free differential Perm-algebra PermDer X, d relative to the operation f  g = f d(g), f, g  PermDer X, d is isomorphic to the free SLS-algebra generated by X.

Corollary 2. A linear basis of the subalgebra F mentioned in Theorem 2 consists of all monomials u  Perm X() of weight -1 such that u = vx(n),
x  X, n > 0.

The proof is completely analogous to that of [5] for ComDer X, d .

5. A criterion of speciality

Let us say that an SLS-algebra (A, ) is nice if for every x  A there exists a linear map µx : A  A  A such that µx(a  b) = (a  x)  b for all a, b  A.
It is easy to see that (A, ) is nice if and only if for every ai, bi  A (i = 1, . . . , n) the equality

implies

ai  bi = 0
i

for all x  A.

(ai  x)  bi = 0
i

Example 2. A Novikov algebra is a nice SLS-algebra, the operator µx coincides with the right multiplication by x.

Example 3. Let V be a linear space and let A = T (V )/I, where I is the ideal spanned by

a0a1 . . . anan+1 - a0a(1) . . . a(n)an+1, ai  V,   Sn.

Obviously, A is an associative (thus, left-symmetric) algebra satisfying the

identities of SLS-algebras. This is not a Novikov algebra, but it is easy to see

that if uivi = 0 in A then uixvi = 0. So, A is a nice SLS-algebra which

i

i

is not Novikov.

Example 4. Suppose V is a 3-dimensional space with a basis x, y, z. Let A be the nice SLS-algebra from Example 3, and let A = A/(xz). Then xyz = 0 in A, so A is an SLS-algebra which is not nice.

Example 4 shows us that the class of nice SLS-algebra is not a variety: it is not closed relative to homomorphic images.
The main purpose of this section is to prove the following criterion.

Theorem 3. A left-symmetric algebra (A, ) embeds into a differential Permalgebra in such a way that a  b = ad(b) for a, b  A if and only if A is a nice SLS-algebra.

The "only if" part is easy: the defining identities of an SLS-algebra holds on a differential Perm-algebra, and the map µx acts as a (left) multiplication by d(x):
µx(a  b) = d(x)ad(b) = ad(x)d(b) = (a  x)  b
for a, b, x  A. To prove the "if" part, we first construct the universal enveloping Novikov
dialgebra for a nice SLS-algebra and then apply Corollary 1. Suppose (A, ) is a nice SLS-algebra. As above, let T (A) stand for the
(associative) tensor algebra of the space A (without an identity), and let D(A) be the left-symmetric dialgebra constructed on T (A) relative to the operations defined by (3.1), (3.2).
Let V stand for the right ideal of the algebra T (A) generated by

g(a, x) = ax - µx(a), a  A  A  A, x  A.

Choose a linear basis X of A in the form X = X0  X1 where X0 is a linear basis of A  A and X1 is a complement of X0. It is easy to see that

V = Span {ax1 . . . xn - µxn . . . µx1(a) | a  X0, xi  X, i  1}.

In particular, V A = 0 since every generator of V as of a linear space contains

a unique principal term.

Note that

(a  b)f - M(af b)  V

(5.1)

for all a, b  A, f  T (A), by the definition of M. Denote K = {f  T (A) | M(af b) = 0 for all a, b  A}

For example, xy - yx  K. Moreover, if f  K then for all u, v  T (A)  {1} we have uf v  K. Indeed,

M (auf vb) = M (M (au)f x1 . . . xnb) = M (M (M (au)f x1)x2 . . . xnb) = 0
for v = x1 . . . xn, n  0. Here we used the obvious corollary of the definition of M:
M(uv) = M(M(u)v), u, v  T (A).
In particular, if f  K and u, v  T (A) then M(uf v) = 0. Note that

h(x, y, z) = xyz + (x  z)  y - (x  y)z - (x  z)y  K

ON THE EMBEDDING INTO DIFFERENTIAL ALGEBRAS

for all x, y, z  A. Indeed, compute

M(ah(x, y, z)b) = M(axyz + a(x  z)  y - a(x  y)z - a(x  z)y)  b = (((a  x)  y)  z + a  ((x  z)  y) - (a  (x  y))  z - (a  (x  z))  y)  b = (((ax)z)y+a((xz)y)-(az)(xy)-(a(xz))y)b = 0b = 0.

Let I  T (A) stand for the linear span of all uf v, u  T (A), v  T (A){1}; this is a proper subset of K. In particular, uxy - uyx  I for all u  T (A), x, y  A. Hence, we may permute variables in T (A) modulo I leaving the first letter unchanged.

Lemma 3. The set I is a two-sided ideal of D(A).

Proof. For all a  A, u, v  T (A) we have

a  (uv)  (a  u)v + u(a  v) - uav (mod I).

(5.2)

It is easy to prove by induction on the length of v. Let f  K, u  T (A), v  T (A)  {1}. If v = 1 then M(uf v) = 0 and thus

uf v  T (A) + T (A)  uf v = 0.

Consider the case v = 1. For every a, b  A, left symmetry implies

M(aM(uf )b) = (a  M(uf ))  b = (a  (M(uf )  b) + (M(uf )  a)  b - M(uf )  (a  b) = 0
since M(uf )  x = M(uf x) = 0 for all x  A. Hence, M(uf )  K. Therefore, (5.2) leads to
uf  w = M(uf )  w  -(n - 1)wM(uf )  0 (mod I)
for every w  T (A) of length n. Similarly, w  uf = wM(uf )  I
for every w  T (A). This is a straightforward corollary of the definition that I  T (A)  I. It
remains to show T (A)  I  I. Choose uf v  I for f  K, w  T (A), and apply (5.2) for x = M(w):
w  uf v  (x  u)f v + u(x  f )v + uf (x  v) - 2uxf v (mod I)
(for v = 1; if v = 1 then the equation is analogous but simpler). Obviously, we need to prove x  f  K since all other summands belong to I. Indeed, consider
x  af  (x  a)f + a(x  f ) - axf (mod I).

16

P. S. KOLESNIKOV AND B. K. SARTAYEV

Since M(I)  b = 0, we obtain

M(a(x  f )b) = M((x  af )b) - M((x  a)f b) + M(axf b) = M(x  af )  b = (x  M(af ))  b = 0

due to left symmetry. Hence, T (A)  I  I.

Lemma 4. The set J = I + V is a two-sided ideal of the dialgebra D(A).

Proof. Since I is already known to be an ideal, it remains to consider the right ideal V of T (A). By definition, V  T (A)  V .
Denote

g(a  b, x) = (a  b)x - (a  x)  b, a, b, x  A.

Then M(g(a  b, x)v) = 0 for all v  T (A) by (4.2), and thus V A  T (A) = 0. For v = 1, we may see M(g(a  b, x)) = (a  b)  x - (a  x)  b. Hence, uM(g(a  b, x)) = u((a  b)  x - (a  x)  b)  uh(a, x, b) - uh(a, b, x)  0 (mod I). It follows that

V  T (A)  I

by (5.2). Similarly, u  g(a  b, x)v = uM(g(a  b, x)v)  I.
v  T (A)  {1}. To complete the proof it remains to calculate

for all u  T (A),

c  g(a  b, x) = c  (a  b)x - c  ((a  x)  b) = (c  (a  b))x + (a  b)(c  x) - (a  b)cx - c  ((a  x)  b)
 (c  x)  (a  b) + (a  (c  x))  b - ((a  c)  x)  b - c  ((a  x)  b) (mod V ). The latter relation is zero in every SLS-algebra. Then u  g(a  b, x)v  J for all u, v  T (A) by (5.2). Lemma 5. For all u, w, v  T (A) we have
(u  v)  w - (u  w)  v  J,
(u  v)  w - (u  w)  v  J. In particular, D(A)/J is a Novikov dialgebra.
Proof. The first relation follows from the definition of operations: (u  v)  w - (u  w)  v = uM(v)M(w) - uM(w)M(v)  I.
Let us prove the second one by induction on the length of w. For w = a  A, (u  v)  a = M(u  v)  a = (M(u)  M(v))  a,
(u  a)  v = (M (u)  a)M (v)  µM(v)(M (u)  a) (mod V ).

Hence, (u  v)  a - (u  a)  v  V  J. Next,
(u  v)  wa = ((u  v)  w)a + w(M(u  v)  a) - wM(u  v)a = ((u  v)  w)a + w((M(u)  M(v))  a) - w(M(u)  M(v))a,

(u  wa)  v = (u  wa)M(v) = (u  w)aM(v) + w(M(u)  a)M(v) - wM(u)aM(v)
 (u  w)M(v)a + w(M(u)  a)M(v) - wM(u)aM(v) (mod I). Hence,
(u  v)  wa - (u  wa)  v  ((u  v)  w)a - (u  w)M(v)a + wh(M(u), a, M(v))
= ((u  v)  w - (u  w)  v)a + wh(M(u), a, M(v))  0 (mod J).

Remark 1. Suppose A is a Novikov algebra. If T is an ideal of the leftsymmetric algebra D(A) such that D(A)/T is a Novikov algebra then T contains uh(x, y, z) for all u  T (A), x, y, z  A (it follows from the proof of Lemma 5). Therefore, the universal enveloping Novikov dialgebra N (A) of A is actually an image of A  A2  A3  T (A). In particular, if A is finite-dimensional then so is N (A).
Lemma 6. A  J = {0}.
Proof. Recall that a linear basis X of A is chosen in the form X = X0  X1 where X0 is a basis of A  A and X1 is its complement. Then T (A) is the space of non-commutative polynomials in X.
By definition, the space V is spanned by
g(a, x1 . . . xn) = ax1 . . . xn - µxn . . . µx1(a), a  X0, x1, . . . , xn  X. (5.3)
Suppose u  T (A) is a word starting with a letter from X0: u = (a  b)w. Then for every f  K, v  T (A)  {1} we have
uf v = (a  b)wf v  M(awf vb) = 0 (mod V )
by (5.1). Assume J = I + V has a nonzero intersection with A. Then we may write
the following equation in T (A):
f1 + f0 + g = a  A, a = 0,
where g  V , fi is a linear combination of the elements like uf v with u starting with a letter from Xi, i = 0, 1. As we noted above, f0  V . Every monomial in f1 is of length at least 2 by the definition of I. All monomials that emerge in elements of V start with a letter from X0, so f1 must be zero.

Therefore, we come to a = f0 + g  V  A which is impossible for a = 0.
Corollary 3. A nice SLS-algebra (A, ) may be embedded into a Novikov dialgebra (N (A), , ) in such a way that a  b = a  b for a, b  A.
Indeed, N (A) = D(A)/J is the desired dialgebra.
Remark 2. Note that the generators of I and V represent the necessary conditions on a Novikov dialgebra which contains (A, ) in such a way that a  b = a  b for a, b  A. Hence, D(A)/J is the universal enveloping Novikov dialgebra of (A, ).
Now we may finish the proof of Theorem 3. A nice SLS-algebra (A, ) embeds into a Novikov dialgebra (N (A), , ), and the latter embeds into a differential Perm-algebra (P, d) by Theorem 1. Since a  b = a  b = ad(b)  P for a, b  A, this is a desired embedding.
Corollary 4. The free SLS-algebra SLS X is nice.
Corollary 5. The variety SLS is the smallest one containing the class of all special left-symmetric algebras.
