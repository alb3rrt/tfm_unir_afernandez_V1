## Abstract

In the next decades, the gravitational-wave (GW) standard siren observations and the neutral hydrogen 21 cm intensity mapping (IM) surveys, as two promising non-optical cosmological probes, will play an important role in precisely measuring cosmological parameters. In this work, we make a forecast for cosmological parameter estimation with the synergy between the GW standard siren observations and the 21 cm IM surveys. We choose the Taiji observatory and the Einstein Telescope (ET) as the representatives of the GW detection projects and choose the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) phase I mid-frequency array as the representative of the 21 cm IM experiments. We find that the synergy of the GW standard siren observations and the 21 cm IM surveys could break the cosmological parameter degeneracies. The joint Taiji+ET+SKA data give $\sigma(H_0)=0.23\ {\rm km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model, $\sigma(w)=0.025$ in the $w$CDM model, and $\sigma(w_0)=0.057$ and $\sigma(w_a)=0.275$ in the CPL model, which are better than the results of $Planck$ 2018 TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing+SNe+BAO. In the $\Lambda$CDM model, the constraint accuracies of $H_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ are less than or rather close to 1%, indicating that the magnificent prospects for non-optical precision cosmology are worth expecting.
