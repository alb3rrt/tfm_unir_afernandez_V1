Abstract: We consider primordial perturbations from general two-field inflation in interaction picture. We verify that normalized to the single-field case, the power spectrum of scalar perturbations in the two-field version is identical beyond any slow roll approximation, except with different scalar spectral index. We then report that the two bispectrums also coincide at the leading order of slow roll parameters, which divide only at the next-leading order. Combing the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, we finally show that twofield chaotic and natural inflation can be distinguished by current BK14/Planck and future CMB-S4 experiment respectively.

1 Introduction
Inflation [1­3], which attempts to resolve both horizon and flatness problem in the early Universe, is one of key ingredients in the standard CDM cosmology. Current observations from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments [4, 5] imply that power spectrum of primordial scalar perturbation(s) from inflation has to be both nearly scale invariant and Gaussian, and bispectrum of the primordial scalar perturbation(s) has a nonlinear parameter fNL with a magnitude smaller than O(10). Future experiments such as Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB-S4) [6] as well as Large Scale Structure [7] are underway for higher precision measurements.
Similar to scattering amplitudes in collider physics based on quantum field theory, the technical difficulty in deriving high-order correlators such as the bispectrum of the scalar perturbation in interaction picture is due to a large number of "Feynman diagrams" from a complex action, and subsequently a large amount of complex integrals over conformal time. The technical issue can be addressed in certain circumstances where there are effective theoretical tools to handle it. The first well-known example is the single-field inflation [8, 9]. Since current data has not yet identified either the number of inflaton scalars or the shape of inflation potential, a comparison between a single-field and its multi-field version is of phenomenological interest.
­1­

Unlike earlier studies such as [10, 11], we consider the multi-field inflation where all of components contribute to the energy density during inflation. In this context, N formalism [12, 13] enables us to calculate both the power spectrum [13­15] and the bispectrum [16­ 25] of the primordial perturbations. Although the N formalism makes the aforementioned calculations plausible, they are however limited to special multi-field inflation. For possible generalization from other perspective, see e.g. [26­28]. Instead of N formalism, in this study we will calculate the primordial perturbations in general two-field inflation in interaction picture. For earlier attempts, see [29, 30]. To serve this purpose, we have developed an analytic program.1
The rest of materials are organized as follows. In Sec.2, we introduce general two-field inflation, where two different gauges, suitable slow roll parameters, and dynamics of classical backgrounds are discussed. In order to establish the relationship between the perturbation variables in the two gauges, which is critical for the derivation of the bispectrum, we will use gauge-invariant variable developed by Bardeen [31]. Subsection.3.1 and Subsection.3.2 are devoted to discuss the scalar and tensor perturbation, respectively, where three important observables - scalar spectral index n, tensor-to-scalar ratio r and nonlinear parameter fNL are obtained. In Sec.4, we apply these theoretical results to the two-field version of natural [32] and chaotic [33] inflation, and estimate reaches of current and future experiments on them in well-motivated parameter region. Finally, we conclude in Sec.5.

2 General Two-field Inflation

In this section, we discuss general two-field inflation, with an emphasize on gauge choice to describe the primordial perturbations and suitable slow roll parameters to parametrize the interactions between the two different components.
We restrict to the two-field inflation with Lagrangian

where R is the curvature, gµ is the spacetime metric,  with  = 1 - 2 denote the scalar fields, and V is the inflation potential which includes interactions between 1 and 2. The metric in the ADM framework reads as

ds2 = -N 2dt2 + hij(dxi + N idt)(dxj + N jdt),

(2.2)

in which hij with i, j = 1 - 3 are the dynamical variables, while N and Ni are Lagrangian multipliers.

2.1 Gauges There are two different gauges for explicit purpose

 gauge :  = (t),

hij = a2[(1 + 2)ij + ij], iij = 0, ii = 0,

 gauge :  = (t) + (t, x), hij = a2[ij + ij], iij = 0, ii = 0, (2.3)

where  and  refer to classical backgrounds and quantum fluctuations respectively, a(t) is the scale factor,  is gauge-invariant curvature perturbation, and  denotes tensor perturbation. In Eq.(2.3), the scalar perturbation is neatly described by  in the  gauge.
The scalar perturbations described by the perturbation freedoms  and  in the two different gauges are connected to each other. Their relationship is important for analytic calculation of the bispectrum as below. In the single-field inflation, it is uncovered in terms of a suitable spacetime coordinate transformation which lets the perturbation freedom in the  gauge vanishes [8] . However, it is not clear how to apply this simple method to general multi-field inflation. In the N formalism, this issue is solved by imposing adiabatic condition on each component, under which  is the sum of individual curvature perturbations  related to component field  [34].
In the interaction picture, one can resolve this issue in terms of gauge-invariant variable developed by Bardeen [31]

The smallness of  can be satisfied by imposing |  ||  | and | V |<< H2 for arbitrary  and , which are "natural" for the multi-field inflation under consideration. Because both scalar masses should be light compared to H, and for | / | either far larger or smaller than unity the effective number of inflaton fields is actually reduced such as in quasi-single
field inflation [35, 36].

3 Primordial Perturbations

3.1 Scalar Perturbation
With a gauge choice in Eq.(2.3), the Lagrangian multipliers N and Ni can be solved in terms of the equations L/N = 0 and L/Ni = 0. Following the notation in ref.[8], we expand the Lagrangian multipliers as follows,

N = 1 + , Ni = i~,

(3.1)

where  and ~ are linear functions of the scalar perturbations, as keeping up to the linear order is sufficient [8] to derive both the quadratic and cubic action of the curvature perturbation.

(3.2)

where 2 = ii. Eq.(3.2) reduces to the result of single-field inflation [37] under the singlefield limit.
Substituting Eq.(3.2) into Eq.(2.1) and replacing  in terms of  in Eq.(2.6) give rise to the quadratic action for the curvature perturbation

S2 = d4x a32 - a(i)2 ,

(3.3)

where =  2/2H2 . Here, Eq.(3.3) is exact in the sense that no slow roll approximations have been required in the derivation of Eq.(3.3). To verify this point, one can recalculate S2
in the  gauge, in which the Lagrangian multipliers read as

A couple of comments are in order regarding the observables in Eqs.(3.8) and (3.9).

· Normalized to the single-field case with =  , the power spectrum of the two-field inflation is the same2 as that of the single-field inflation. It mainly follows the fact that the quadratic action of the scalar perturbations only depends on the slow roll parameters .
· The differences between single-field inflation and its two-field version can be exposed in terms of the scalar spectral index. Under the single-field limit, Eq.(3.9) reduces to the well-known result n - 1  2 - 6 . In Eq.(3.9) the derivation in n from the single-field prediction can be of the same order as the slow roll parameters, which allows them to play a role in future precision measurement on n [6].
To derive the bispectrum, one has to evolve the action for the curvature perturbation to the third order of . Unlike the quadratic action, where it is straightforward to work within the  gauge, there are certain uncertainties in labelling  in this gauge. This obscure can be eliminated in the  gauge.
In the  gauge, the cubic action is separated into two parts

S3 = (Maldacena) + Smix,


(3.10)

where the first part is just two copies of the single-field result [8] which involves in the individual field, while the second part Smix contains mixing terms such as V with  =  which involve in the two different fields. Substituting Eq.(2.6) into Eq.(3.3) does not contribute to the LO cubic action. On the contrary, substituting Eq.(2.6) into Eq.(3.10) gives rise to respectively,

(3.13)

where the sub-leading terms have been neglected. Although the sub-leading terms include contributions arising from V12, V112 and V122 etc, whose explicit forms are shown in appendix.B.1, they are at least the third orders of the slow roll parameters. This implies that under the same normalization, the LO cubic action in Eq.(3.13) coincides with that of the single-field inflation.
As a result of coincidence in the LO bispectrum in Eq.(3.13), the deviation in observable nonlinear parameter related to the bispectrum is

fNL = fNL - fNL  O( 2, 2 , ),

(3.14)

where fNL represents single-field reference value. Current Planck data [4] has constrained | fNL | O(10). Even though the future CMB-S4 [6] or Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) [38] experiment can reduce this error bar by a few times, the uncertainties in fNL are still too large to identify the two-field inflation.

3.2 Tensor Perturbation

Apart from the quadratic action of the scalar perturbation, substituting Eq.(3.2) into Eq.(2.1) yields that of the tensor perturbation as well,

While current BK14/Planck data cannot distinguish them, they are potentially identified by CMB-S4.
4 Numerical Analysis
So far, we have derived the observables n, fNL and r in general two-field inflation. Now, we estimate the sensitivities of these parameters to current and future high precision experiments on the primordial perturbations. As noted above, the differences of fNL between the singlefield and two-field cases are beyond the reaches of either CMB-S4 or LSST experiments. We will use only n and r for numerical analysis.
How to uncover the dependence of n in Eq.(3.9) on r in Eq.(3.18) in general two-field inflation? In a specific inflation scenario, the explicit values of n and r for CMB relevant mode depend on the values of the slow roll parameters at horizon crossing for the mode, which are determined by the values of the scalar field(s) at this moment. In the single-field case, after one eliminates the slow roll parameters, the one-to-one correspondence between n and r is easily established, whereas the correspondence in the two-field case is complexed by the

terms in Eq.(3.9) especially when they also vary independently. The complexity is reduced in certain circumstances under which the  terms are either determined in terms of the terms or simply fixed.
For illustration, we firstly consider the two-field version of natural inflation [33] with V =  V[1 + cos(/f )] + m212, where V are constants, scale f is related to the Planck mass, and mass term to characterize the interaction3 between the two different components, respectively. In this model, the  parameters are fixed as 1 = 2  -MP2 /2f 2. With an explicit value of f , the correspondence between n and r is obtained, where we rewrite the terms as 1 = sin2  and 2 = cos2 . Under the single-field limit tan   0, while in the two-field situation tan   1 in the well-motivated region. Fig.1 shows the largest deviation (in orange) of n in the two-field natural inflation with f = 5MP compared to the single-field case (in black), where the current best constraint from a combination of BICEP2/Keck Array experiments and Planck [39] (in blue) and the expected CMB-S4 sensitivity [6] (in red) are

simultaneously shown for comparison. Even though current BK14/Planck data is unlikely to distinguish them, they are potentially identified by CMB-S4.
We further discuss the two-field version of chaotic inflation [32] with V = i p. Since the chaotic inflation with integer p = 2 - 4 has been disfavored [40], we restrict to the case p = 1. In this model, one finds 1 = 2 = 0 and establishes the correspondence between n and r by rewriting the terms as above, with the single-field case given by tan  = 0. Fig.2 shows that the largest deviation of n (in orange) in this two-field chaotic inflation, compared to the single-field case (in black). It suggests that unlike the single-field case, the two-field version in the well-motivated parameter region has been disfavored by current BK14/Planck data at 95% CL.
5 Conclusion
Motivated by current constraints on the primordial perturbations from inflation, in this study we have considered general two-field inflation. To achieve this goal, we have developed a program in the interaction picture instead of the N formalism as adopted in the literature. In terms of suitable gauges necessary to calculate the bispectrum of the scalar perturbations and suitable slow roll parameters to describe the inflation potential, we have derived the analytic expressions about the scalar spectrum index n, the tensor-to-scalar ratio r and the nonlinear parameter fNL in general two-field inflation. They are valid for general multi-field inflation with slow roll potential.
Combing the theoretic results about n and r, we approached the important phenomenological question - whether the constraints on single-field inflation change in its two-field situation ? We answer this question in two illustrative examples. For the natural inflation, while current BK14/Planck data cannot distinguish the two cases, they are potentially identified by CMB-S4 in the well-motivated parameter region. For the chaotic inflation with p = 1, current BK14/Planck data has already disfavored the two-field version in the well-motivated parameter region, whereas both two cases can be excluded by CMB-S4. Along this line, more two-field examples can be similarly treated.

These derivatives can be organized in the power laws of the slow roll parameters. The first order derivatives V1 and V2 are directly read from the equations of motion in Eqs.(2.9) - (2.10). The second order derivatives such as V11 and V22 follow the definitions of  in Eqs.(2.12)-(2.13), whereas V12 is determined by imposing the field derivative 2 (1) on both sides of Eq.(2.9) ((2.10)).
