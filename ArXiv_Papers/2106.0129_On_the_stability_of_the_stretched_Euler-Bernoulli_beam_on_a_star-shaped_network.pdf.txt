ON THE STABILITY OF THE STRETCHED EULER­BERNOULLI BEAM ON A STAR-SHAPED NETWORK
MAHYAR MAHINZAEIM, GEN QI XU, AND HAI E ZHANG
Abstract. We deal with the stability problem for a stretched Euler­Bernoulli beam on a star graph with three edges. The beams are hinged with respect to the boundary vertices. The inner vertex is capable of both translation and rotation, the latter of which is subject to a combination of elastic and frictional effects. We present detailed results on the properties of the linear monic operator pencil associated with the spectral problem in Hilbert space. Within this framework it is shown that the eigenvectors have the property of forming an unconditional or Riesz basis, which makes it possible to directly deduce the exponential stability of the corresponding C0-semigroup.

1. Background and motivation

The transverse deflection w (s, t) of a homogeneous beam, subjected to a compressive or tensile force proportional to a parameter  is modelled by the modified Euler­Bernoulli beam equation (see, for example, [2, Section 2.2])

In the case where the beam is compressed one has  < 0, otherwise, when  > 0, the beam is stretched.

Our primary interest in this paper lies with the stability property of a planar star-shaped network of

such homogeneous beams, with elasticity and frictional effects in the connectivity conditions. This is an

interesting problem which should find a remarkable application in a varied assortment of mechanical

problems on networks, also called geometric graphs. Surprisingly, however, even in the relatively

simple case considered in this paper, we are not aware that the stability problem has been addressed

previously. From the physical viewpoint the natural question to be answered, but which so far has

escaped attention in the general mathematical literature, is this: Do the connectivity conditions cause

the energy of the beam network to decay uniformly exponentially as time progresses?

To explain our problem in a bit more detail, let us consider first (PDE) on each beam or what we

call edge e:

The solutions w (s, t) = we (s, t) satisfy certain boundary and connectivity conditions at the outer and inner vertices of the beam network. We are going to consider the star graph formed by three edges

e1, e2, e3, as illustrated in Fig. 1. There is a single inner vertex at the origin 0. Conditions at the outer vertices a1, a2, a3 correspond to the beams being hinged at one end. At the inner vertex we have a combination of elasticity and viscous friction acting on the slopes of the beams. The question

of stability then essentially concerns, as will be seen in the sequel, the elasticity and viscous friction

condition at the inner vertex.

The problem with the system considered ­ and, in fact, with all systems described by partial dif-

ferential equations (or "distributed parameter systems") ­ is that it is not clear whether the spectrum

of the corresponding spectral problem does determine in general the exponential stability of the corre-

sponding strongly continuous semigroup (in short C0-semigroup). We must prove that the unbounded system operator generating the C0-semigroup is a discrete spectral operator whose eigenvectors form a Riesz basis for the Hilbert space considered, thus reducing the stability problem to investigating the

abstract spectral problem (see the papers [15, 16] of Miloslavskii or the survey [10] for explanation). This is the focal point of the paper.
Our results are obtained in the context of abstract operator pencils of the form
P () = I - T,
wherein  is the spectral parameter and T is an unbounded, not necessarily skewadjoint, linear operator acting in a Hilbert space. Such a formulation will allow us to prove in a unified framework many important results on the properties of the eigenvalues as well as the eigenvectors of P () under the given boundary and connectivity conditions. The mathematical question directly related to the question in the first paragraph then arises: Does the spectrum of P () determine the decay rate of the C0semigroup? Of course the answer to this question will be "yes" if T is bounded ­ which is not the case here! ­ and hence is the infinitesimal generator of a uniformly continuous semigroup. (We note that in [17], detailed results of the spectral properties of a related quadratic pencil have been obtained for the single beam case with spatially variable compression/tension.)
The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we lay out some preliminary material for use in the paper, pose the initial/boundary-value problem, and formulate the abstract initial-value problem associated with it. The techniques of our proofs throughout are functional-analytic in spirit, so function spaces and operators basic to the formulation are considered in the section. We will use terminology common in the literature of differential equations on networks or on geometric graphs, and we recommend the reader consult [18] for definition of these terms and development of the related theory. We also refer the interested reader to the monographs [4, 11, 21] for stability (and stability related) results in the context of string, beam, and plate networks. Moreover, a rather nice overview of applications of the theory of graphs to modelling a variety of problems in physics has very recently been given in [1].
In Sections 3 and 4 we examine the well-posedness of the abstract initial-value problem, which requires study of the C0-semigroup generating property of the system operator T , and also give the first results on the location and structure of the spectrum of T (or, equivalently, of P ()). For some details of representing initial/boundary-value problems by abstract initial-value problems in the framework of semigroups and other standard facts of semigroup theory we refer the reader, for example, to the books [3, 9, 19].
The heart of this work ­ also from a technical standpoint ­ lies in Sections 5 and 6, where we establish the key results required for the proof of the exponential stability of the C0-semigroup in Section 7. While Section 5 is devoted to deriving asymptotic estimates for the eigenvalues of P () and determining their multiplicities, in Section 6 the completeness, minimality, and Riesz basis properties of the eigenvectors are investigated with the aid especially of two theorems due respectively to Keldysh [7, Theorem V.8.1] (see also [6, Theorem X.4.1]) and Xu and Yung [22, Theorem 1.1]. The former is a well-known result on the completeness of the eigen- and associated vectors of compact operators on a Hilbert space which are subject to certain nuclearity conditions. The latter is on the Riesz basis

property and is particularly well suited for our purposes because it exploits the semigroup description of our system model.
We close this introductory section with a final comment. The reader will undoubtedly notice that the results of Sections 3 to 6 are not produced arbitrarily, but are together connected to the main line of argument of the paper (paralleling the treatment in [12]), namely, that the asymptotic location of the eigenvalues of P () together with the Riesz basis property of the eigenvectors (with parentheses or not) are all that we require to prove that T generates an exponentially stable C0-semigroup. The result, simply put, is then that the spectrum of T does indeed determine the exponential stability, and therefore the decay rate of the C0-semigroup. In such a situation, we say that T satisfies the spectrum determined growth assumption (a term introduced by Triggiani [20]), and we will use this in connection with our final result in Section 7.

2. Problem formulation and preliminaries

As mentioned in the introduction, our results will be obtained in the framework of abstract function spaces. We begin with a detailed description of the physical model.

2.1. Description of the physical model. We define the geometric graph G := (V, E), with V = {0, a1, a2, a3} and E = {e1, e2, e3}, the vertex and edge sets, respectively. Each edge ej connecting the inner vertex 0 to the outer vertices aj for j = 1, 2, 3 is of unit length and is identified with the interval sj  [0, 1]. The value sj = 1 corresponds to the outer vertices, and sj = 0 corresponds to the inner vertex.
Let wj (sj, t) denote the deflection of the edge ej at sj from the equilibrium position of the beam network (in the direction orthogonal to it). To this end we suppose that wj (sj, t) satisfies

where we assume that  > 0 (that is, the beam is stretched). The edges are assumed hinged at the outer vertices aj, so the boundary conditions at sj = 1 are

(2.2)

wj (1, t) =

2  s2j

sj =1

j = 1, 2, 3.

At the inner vertex we impose the following connectivity conditions:

Deflection continuity condition:

(2.3)

wj (0, t) = wk (0, t) , j, k = 1, 2, 3.

Force balance condition:

s2j wj (sj, t) -  sj wj (sj, t) -  sjt wj (sj, t)

= 0,
sj =0

j = 1, 2, 3.

The connectivity conditions seem rather natural. Condition (2.3) ensures the continuity of the

deflections of the edges across the vertex, for otherwise the edges would not be joined to the network.

Condition (2.4) balances the internal forces acting on the vertex, assuming (as is the case in practically

almost all physical problems of this sort) that the edges undergo "nonfollowing" tension remaining

constant in direction along their axes (see [2, p. 91]). Condition (2.5) corresponds to the bending

moments and slopes of the edges in the vertex being proportional. The slopes are, more concretely,

acted on by elastic and viscous frictional effects, which are proportional to the parameters   0 and

  0, respectively (note that we require  only to be nonnegative!).

The initial/boundary-value problem (hereafter called (IBVP)) consists of (2.1), the boundary and

connectivity conditions (2.2) to (2.5), together with the initial conditions

It is important to note that the problem described by (IBVP) does not fit precisely into the framework considered, for example, in [21, Section 4.2]; and so in what follows we suggest an alternative approach.

2.2. Abstract formulation. To abstract (IBVP), we begin by setting

vj

(s, t)

=

 t wj

(s, t) ,

xj (s, t) = wj (s, t) , vj (s, t) ,

j = 1, 2, 3,

and define

x (s, t) = x1 (s, t) , x2 (s, t) , x3 (s, t) .

Denoting by W2m (0, 1) the usual complex Sobolev­Hilbert space of order m, we define the space

W^ 22 (0, 1) = f  W22 (0, 1) f (1) = 0 .

With the inner product (recall   0)

1
f, g 2 = f (2) (s) g(2) (s) ds + f  (0) g (0), f, g  W^ 22 (0, 1) ,
0
the space W^ 22 (0, 1) is a Hilbert space. We denote by L2 (G) the metric space of vector-valued functions f (s) = f1 (s) , f2 (s) , f3 (s) ,
where fj  L2 (0, 1) for j = 1, 2, 3. Similarly we define the space W^ 22 (G) of vector-valued functions g (s) = g1 (s) , g2 (s) , g3 (s) , where gj  W^ 22 (0, 1) and gj (0) = gk (0) for j, k = 1, 2, 3. With these definitions we define the space

W^ 22 (G) × L2 (G) = X :=

xj = wj, vj  W^ 22 (0, 1) × L2 (0, 1) , wj (0) = wk (0) , j, k = 1, 2, 3

and write (2.6)

and

(2.7)

(T x) (s) =

,

x  D (T ) .

Then, defining [x (t)] (s) := x (s, t), we can rewrite (IBVP) as an abstract initial-value problem in the state space X:

and

x0

=

gj (·) , hj (·)

3 j=1

.

A function

t  x (t) is said to be a classical solution of (AIVP) if x  C1 ((0, ) ; X)  C ([0, ) ; D (T )). The

system described by (AIVP) is called exponentially stable if there exist certain constants M,  > 0

such that

(2.8)

x (t) X  M e-t x0 X, t  0,

for any initial state x0  X, where  is the decay rate. The goal in the paper, then, becomes one of proving that the solutions of (AIVP) (assuming x0 sufficiently smooth) are such that (2.8) is satisfied, and so decay exponentially to zero as t  .

3. Well-posedness of (AIVP) and spectral problem on X
As stated in the introduction, we wish to approach the stability problem by investigating the spectral problem for (AIVP), but we now can be more specific. We examine first the question of well-posedness.

3.1. Well-posedness of (AIVP). To examine the well-posedness of (AIVP), we rely on studying specific properties of the system operator T defined by (2.6), (2.7). We begin with two lemmas which will be also of importance later in the proofs of the results in Section 6.

Lemma 3.1. T has a compact inverse.

Proof. We consider the equation (T x) (s) = y (s) for any y  X and x  D (T ); namely, with y (s) =

Since the embeddings W24 (G)  W^ 22 (G)  W^ 22 (G) and W^ 22 (G)  L2 (G) are compact it follows that T -1 is a compact linear operator on X.

Remark 3.1. We remark that the assumption  > 0 cannot be weakened to   0 in the proof of the lemma. In particular this means (see Theorem 3.2 in the next subsection) that 0 is excluded from the spectrum.

Lemma 3.2. T is maximal dissipative when  > 0 and skewadjoint when  = 0.

Proof. To prove that T is maximal dissipative, we need only show that Re T x, x X  0 for all x  D (T ). An elementary calculation using integration by parts gives for x  D (T )

Thus T is dissipative when  > 0, and skewsymmetric when  = 0. The maximal dissipativity of T follows immediately from the result of Lemma 3.1. For  = 0, therefore, T is a closed skewsymmetric operator in X with a compact inverse, which implies that T is skewadjoint.

Combining Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 we have the following result immediately from the Lumer­Phillips theorem (see, for example, [19, Section 1.4] for details).

Theorem 3.1. The system operator T as defined by (2.6), (2.7) is the infinitesimal generator of a contractive C0-semigroup {S (t)}t0 of bounded linear operators on X.

We close with what is, as a corollary of Theorem 3.1, a natural verification of the well-posedness of (AIVP): namely it has the unique classical solution for all x0  D (T ) given by

(3.11)

x (t) = S (t) x0, t  0.

(We remark that it will not be until Section 7 that we will return to the solution (3.11) and be able to state our conclusions about its exponential stability.)

3.2. Spectral problem on X. We now turn to the spectral problem which we consider here as one of studying the eigenvalues as well as the eigenvectors, and (if any) associated vectors of the linear monic pencil P (), defined by

(3.12)

P () = I - T, D (P ()) = D (T ) ,

for all   C (by definition). Then we use the following standard definitions.

Definition 3.1. Consider the pencil (3.12), and suppose that   (I - T ) is a mapping from C into the set of closed linear operators in X. A number  is said to belong to  (P ), the resolvent set of P (), provided P () has a closed bounded inverse. We call the mapping   (I - T )-1 the resolvent function. If    (P ), then  is said to be in the spectrum  (P ) of P (). We say    (P ) is an eigenvalue of P () if the eigenspace ker (I - T ) = {0}. An element x () = 0 of ker (I - T ) is then called the eigenvector belonging to . The set of all eigenvalues of P () is the point spectrum of P (), denoted p (P ). The set of eigenvalues of finite type is the set of isolated points of  (P ) (with a deleted neighbourhood in the resolvent set), which are also eigenvalues, each with finite algebraic multiplicity, and such that P () is a Fredholm operator. It forms the discrete spectrum.

Definition 3.2. The geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue   p (P ) is the number of linearly
independent eigenvectors in a system of chains of eigen- and associated vectors of P () corresponding
to  and is defined as dim ker (I - T ). The algebraic multiplicity of  is the maximum value of the
sum of the lengths of chains corresponding to the linearly independent eigenvectors and is defined as supkN dim ker (I - T )k. We call  semisimple if it has equal geometric and algebraic multiplicities, and simple if it is semisimple and dim ker (I - T ) = 1.

Definition 3.3. A sequence of eigenvalues {k} is said to be correctly enumerated if it is a sequence of real or complex numbers which are counted properly ­ that is, such that
(i) -k = k whenever Im k = 0; (ii) Im k  Im j for k > j; (iii) their algebraic multiplicities are taken into account; and (iv) the index set is Z (= ±N  {0}) in case the number of purely real eigenvalues is odd, and Z\ {0}
in case it is even.

The next result refers to the location of the spectrum of P ().

Theorem 3.2. Let the pencil P () be given as in (3.12), with T defined by (2.6), (2.7). Then the following statements hold:
(1)  (P ) = p (P ). (2) The number  = 0 is not an eigenvalue of P (). (3) If   p (P ), then   p (P ). Hence  (P ) is symmetric with respect to the real axis. (4) For   0 the spectrum of P () lies in the closed left half-plane. When  > 0 the spectrum is
confined to the open left half-plane.

Proof. Statements (1) and (2) follow from Lemma 3.1. In fact from the lemma it follows that associated with P () is a compact resolvent function, and 0   (P ). So the spectrum of P () is discrete with no finite accumulation points (see [6, Theorem XV.2.3] or [8, Theorem III.6.29]).
In order to establish statement (3), let x (, s) be an eigenvector of P () = I - T corresponding to the eigenvalue . Then

(3.13)

(I - T ) x (, s) = 0.

STRETCHED EULER­BERNOULLI BEAM ON STAR GRAPH

By the definition of T we have I - T = I - T . So

(I - T ) x (, s) = (I - T ) x (, s) = 0,

which means that x (, s) is the eigenvector corresponding to . For the proof of statement (4) it is convenient to take the inner product of (3.13) with x (, s),

(I - T ) x () , x () X =

which proves that the spectrum of P () lies in the closed left half-plane. We show that if  > 0, then

Re  < 0. Indeed, suppose Re  = 0, that is,  is a purely imaginary eigenvalue,  = iµ with µ  R.

Then from (3.14) along with (3.10) we have

Re T x () , x () X = -

vj (0) 2 = 0,

j=1

which clearly implies, since  > 0,

3
vj (0) 2 = 0.

As x (, s) = that

wj (0) 2 = 0,

and therefore wj (0) = 0 for j = 1, 2, 3 since || > 0. In this case, the pair wj (s), vj (s) solves the

problem

wj (0) = 0,
wj(2) (0) = 0,
3
wj(3) (0) = 0.

j = 1, 2, 3, j = 1, 2, 3,

j=1

We show that any solution of (3.15) must be the zero solution. Notice that since  = iµ, we have -2 = µ2 > 0. Consider the problem

w(4) (s) - w(2) (s) = µ2w (s) , s  (0, 1) ,

w (1) = w(2) (1) = 0, w (0) = 0,

w(2) (0) = 0.

Let  (s) be a nonzero solution of the above problem. Without loss of generality we may assume that it is a real function on [0, 1]. We multiply the differential equation (4) (s) - (2) (s) = µ2 (s) by

10

MAHYAR MAHINZAEIM, GEN QI XU, AND HAI E ZHANG

(3) (s) and integrate from 0 to 1, performing some integration by parts. Then, because the problem is real, we obtain after some simplification
((3) (1))2 - ((3) (0))2 = -µ2( (1))2,

and so (3) (0) = 0. Then solutions of (3.15) are of the form

wj (s) = aj (s) .

The connectivity condition wj (0) = wk (0) implies aj = ak  a. Hence wj (s) = a (s) for j = 1, 2, 3.

Since

3 k=1

w(3)

(0)

=

3a(3) (0)

=

0,

we

obtain

a

=

0.

This means that (3.15) has only the zero

solution. Thus there can be no purely imaginary   p (P ). This completes the proof of statement

(4), and hence of the theorem.

4. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

In this section we give a detailed analysis of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the pencil P ().

Let    (P ) (= p (P )) and x (, s) =

wj (, s) , vj (, s)

3 j=1

be

the

corresponding

eigenvector.

Then (3.13) implies

vj (s) = wj (s) , s  (0, 1) , j = 1, 2, 3,

-wj(4) (s) + wj(2) (s) = vj (s) , wj (1) = wj(2) (1) = 0, wj (0) = wk (0) ,

s  (0, 1) , j = 1, 2, 3, j, k = 1, 2, 3,

j = 1, 2, 3,

wj(2) (0) - wj (0) - vj (0) = 0,
3
(wj(3) (0) - wj (0)) = 0.
j=1
Clearly, then wj (s) solves the problem wj(4) (s) - wj(2) (s) = -2wj (s) ,
wj (1) = wj(2) (1) = 0,
wj (0) = wk (0) ,

j = 1, 2, 3,
s  (0, 1) , j = 1, 2, 3, j, k = 1, 2, 3,

j = 1, 2, 3,

wj(2) (0) - ( + ) wj (0) = 0,

j = 1, 2, 3,

3
(wj(3) (0) - wj (0)) = 0,
j=1

which has associated with it the characteristic equation

For the differential equation w(4) (s)-w(2) (s) = -2w (s) we have the fundamental solutions cosh µ1s, sinh µ1s, sinh µ3s, cosh µ3s. The general solution therefore is
 (s) = a1 sinh µ1s + a2 cosh µ1s + a3 sinh µ3s + a4 cosh µ3s
where a1, a2, a3, a4 are arbitrary constants. Using the boundary conditions w (1) = w(2) (1) = 0 we find that

 (1) = a1 sinh µ1 + a2 cosh µ1 + a3 sinh µ3 + a4 cosh µ3 = 0,

(2) (1) = µ21 (a1 sinh µ1 + a2 cosh µ1) + µ23 (a3 sinh µ3, +a4 cosh µ3) = 0, and so we obtain

(4.2)

(µ23 - µ21) (a3 sinh µ3 + a4 cosh µ3) = 0.

Observing from (4.1) that µ23 - µ21 = - 2 - 42, we find from (4.2) that a3 sinh µ3 + a4 cosh µ3 = 0, provided that 2 - 42 = 0, and so a1 sinh µ1 + a2 cosh µ1 = 0. We set

a1 = c1 cosh µ1, a2 = -c1 sinh µ1, a3 = c2 cosh µ3, a4 = -c2 sinh µ3.

Then the solution satisfying w (1) = w(2) (1) = 0 becomes

Therefore, we can set

 (s) = c1 sinh µ1 (1 - s) + c2 sinh µ3 (1 - s) .

(4.3)

wj (s) = cj,1 sinh µ1 (1 - s) + cj,2 sinh µ3 (1 - s) , j = 1, 2, 3,

and, using the connectivity conditions wj(2) (0)- ( + ) wj (0) = 0 and

3 j=1

(wj(3)

obtain the following equations:

We note from (4.1) that µ23 + µ21 =  and µ1µ3 = . Substitution in the second equation of (4.4) yields

The first equation becomes

and, as a result, we have

We divide the discussion of its solutions into the treatment of two cases.

Case 1. We consider first the case of a nonzero solution pair

3 j=1

cj,1,

3 j=1

cj,2

of

(4.5).

The

necessary and sufficient condition for this is that the determinant should vanish, which is easily seen

to reduce to the condition

(4.6) D () := µ33 cosh µ1 sinh µ3 - µ31 sinh µ1 cosh µ3 + (µ23 - µ21) ( + ) cosh µ1 cosh µ3 = 0.

Let us set

3
cj,2 = -bµ1 [µ1 sinh µ1 + ( + ) cosh µ1] ,
j=1

12

MAHYAR MAHINZAEIM, GEN QI XU, AND HAI E ZHANG

for some number b = 0. Then

3
cj,1 = bµ3 [µ3 sinh µ3 + ( + ) cosh µ3] .
j=1

The continuity condition wj (0) = wk (0)  w (0) implies, together with (4.3), that

(4.7)

cj,1 sinh µ1 + cj,2 sinh µ3 = w (0) .

So there follows

sinh µ1 {bµ3 [µ3 sinh µ3 + ( + ) cosh µ3]} - sinh µ3 {bµ1 [µ1 sinh µ1 + ( + ) cosh µ1]} = 3w (0)

and hence

w (0)

=

b 3

(µ23 - µ21) sinh µ1 sinh µ3 + ( + ) (µ3 sinh µ1 cosh µ3 - µ1 cosh µ1 sinh µ3)

=

b 3

H

() ,

where

(4.8)

H () := (µ23 - µ21) sinh µ1 sinh µ3 + ( + ) (µ3 sinh µ1 cosh µ3 - µ1 cosh µ1 sinh µ3) .

Consider the equations

(4.9)

cj,1 sinh µ1 + cj,2 sinh µ3 = w (0) , cj,1µ1 [µ1 sinh µ1 + ( + ) cosh µ1] + cj,2µ3 [µ3 sinh µ3 + ( + ) cosh µ3] = 0.

Solving (4.9) for cj,1 and cj,2 we get

cosh µ3 .

Noting that

µ23 [µ3 sinh µ3 + ( + ) cosh µ3] cosh µ1 = D () + µ21 [µ1 sinh µ1 + ( + ) cosh µ1] cosh µ3

and setting

b

=

µ21

[µ1

3cµ1µ3 cosh sinh µ1 + ( +

µ1 cosh µ3 ) cosh µ1]

cosh

µ3

,

where c is an arbitrary constant, it is easy to see that (4.10) simplifies to

cj,1 = cµ1 cosh µ3, cj,2 = -cµ3 cosh µ1.

Thus (4.3) becomes

wj (, s) = c (µ1 cosh µ3 sinh µ1 (1 - s) - µ3 cosh µ1 sinh µ3 (1 - s)) , j = 1, 2, 3,

and is verified to satisfy all the boundary and connectivity conditions.

Case 2. We suppose now that the solution of (4.5) is the zero solution, that is D () = 0. Then, if

3 j=1

cj,1

=

0,

we

have

to

(4.11)

3 j=1

cj,2

=

0.

This

can

be

seen

as

follows.

If

3 j=1

cj,1

=

0,

then

(4.5)

reduces

 

3
µ1 cosh µ3 cj,2 = 0,
j=1

 µ23 sinh µ3 + ( + ) µ3 cosh µ3

3
cj,2 = 0.

j=1

Hence (4.11) admits a nonzero solution if and only if

µ1 cosh µ3 = 0, µ23 sinh µ3 + ( + ) µ3 cosh µ3 = 0,

and this is true if and only if µ1 = µ3 = 0, since cosh2 µ3 - sinh2 µ3 = 1; but this means that

 (= µ1µ3) = 0, which is impossible by Theorem 3.2(2). Therefore if

3 j=1

cj,1

=

0,

then

3 j=1

cj,2

=

0.

STRETCHED EULER­BERNOULLI BEAM ON STAR GRAPH

13

Now, from (4.7) we get that w (0) = 0. A nonzero solution of (4.9) then exists if and only if the determinant H (), as defined by (4.8), vanishes. Then, because sinh µ1 = 0 and sinh µ3 = 0, we have

cj,1

=

-

sinh sinh

µ3 µ1

cj,2.

Setting and recalling that here

3 j=1

cj,1

cj,2 sinh µ1

3 j=1

cj,2

3
cj,1
j=1

3
cj,2

In this case (4.3) becomes

3

wj (, s) = aj (sinh µ3 sinh µ1 (1 - s) - sinh µ1 sinh µ3 (1 - s)) , j = 1, 2, 3,

aj = 0.

j=1

Again it is not difficult to verify that all the boundary and connectivity conditions are satisfied. Let us write, for j = 1, 2, 3,

w1,j (, s) = a1,j (, s) , w2,j (, s) = a2,j (, s) ,

where

(4.12)

 (, s) = sinh µ3 sinh µ1 (1 - s) - sinh µ1 sinh µ3 (1 - s) , a1,1, a1,2, a1,3 = -2, 1, 1 , a2,1, a2,2, a2,3 = 0, 1, -1 .

The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue  can be given as follows:

x (, s) = ax1 (, s) + bx2 (, s) , a, b  C, with

x1 (, s) = w1,1 (, s) , w1,1 (, s) , w1,2 (, s) , w1,2 (, s) , w1,3 (, s) , w1,3 (, s)

= -2 1,  , 1,  , 1,   (, s) ,

x2 (, s) = w2,1 (, s) , w2,1 (, s) , w2,2 (, s) , w2,2 (, s) , w2,3 (, s) , w2,3 (, s)

= 0, 0 , 1,  , - 1,   (, s) .

The following theorem summarises the results of this section and provides the foundation for the investigations to be made in Sections 5 and 6.

Theorem 4.1. Let µk = µk (), k = 1, 2, 3, 4, be defined as in (4.1) for   C, and let D () and H () be defined by (4.6) and (4.8), respectively. Then the spectrum of P () has two branches,

 (P ) = 1 (P )  2 (P )

where

1 (P ) = {  C | D () = 0} , 2 (P ) = {  C | H () = 0} .

For each   1 (P ) the corresponding eigenvector is x (, s) = wj (, s) , wj (, s)

3 j=1

,

where

wj (, s) = c (µ1 cosh µ3 sinh µ1 (1 - s) - µ3 cosh µ1 sinh µ3 (1 - s)) , j = 1, 2, 3.

For each   2 (P ) the corresponding eigenvector is of the form

x (, s) = ax1 (, s) + bx2 (, s) , a, b  C,

where

x1 (, s) = -2 1,  , 1,  , 1,   (, s) , x2 (, s) = 0, 0 , 1,  , - 1,   (, s) ,
and  (, s) = sinh µ3 sinh µ1 (1 - s) - sinh µ1 sinh µ3 (1 - s) .

14

Remark 4.1. With the choice of eigenvectors x1 (, s) and x2 (, s) as in the theorem, one can verify directly that they form an orthogonal basis for the eigensubspace. Indeed, taking the inner product of x1 (, s) with x2 (, s) yields

x1 () , x2 () X = w1 () , w2 () 2 + w1 () , w2 () 1 + w1 () , w2 () 0

5. Asymptotic zeros of D () and H ()

Our main task in this section will be to derive asymptotic estimates for the eigenvalues of P (). We will refer to some of the results of Section 4 in the course of our analysis of the asymptotic zeros of D () and H () (given by (4.6) and (4.8), respectively) throughout the section.

5.1. Asymptotic zeros of D (). We begin by listing some elementary formulas that are needed in what follows:
sinh (x + y) = sinh x cosh y + cosh x sinh y,

cosh (x + y) = cosh x cosh y + sinh x sinh y,

sinh (x - y) = sinh x cosh y - cosh x sinh y,

cosh (x - y) = cosh x cosh y - sinh x sinh y.

Let us use these to rewrite the expression for D () as

(5.1)

2D () = (µ33 - µ31) sinh (µ1 + µ3) + (µ33 + µ31) sinh(µ3 - µ1) + (µ23 - µ21) ( + ) (cosh(µ3 + µ1) + cosh(µ3 - µ1)) .

The asymptotic zeros of D () are investigated in three steps.

Step 1. We first determine the zeros of the equation

cosh (µ3 + µ1) + cosh (µ3 - µ1) = 0.

If we let µ3 - µ1 = (i - 1)  and µ3 + µ1 = (i + 1)  and substitute into this equation, we may

equivalently write that

-1 =

cosh (i - 1)  cosh (i + 1) 

=

e(i-1) e(i+1)

+ e-(i-1) + e-(i+1) ,

which has the zeros So in this case we have

n

=

n

+

 2

,

n  Z.

(5.2)

cosh (i - 1) n cosh (i + 1) n

=

-1,

sinh (i - 1) n sinh (i + 1) n

= 1.

Step 2. Let the sequence {n} represent the zeros of D (). Set

n = n + n, n  Z,

where the n will be determined shortly, and let

µ3 - µ1 = (i - 1) n,

µ3 + µ1 = (i + 1) n.

STRETCHED EULER­BERNOULLI BEAM ON STAR GRAPH

15

Then from the above we have µ3 = in, µ23 = -2n, µ33 = -i3n, µ1 = n, µ21 = 2n, µ31 = 3n,
and n = µ1µ3 = i2n.
Substituting these relations into (5.1) we get

2D (n) = -3n (i + 1) sinh (i + 1) n - 3n (i - 1) sinh (i - 1) n - 22n ( + i2n) (cosh (i + 1) n + cosh (i - 1) n) .

The characteristic equation 2D (n) = 0 then becomes

0 = -n (i + 1) sinh (i + 1) n - n (i - 1) sinh (i - 1) n

- 2 ( + i2n) (cosh (i + 1) n + cosh (i - 1) n) ,

or equivalently

(5.3)

-n 2 ( + i2n)

=

cosh (i + (i + 1) sinh (i +

1) n 1) n

+ cosh (i - 1) n + (i - 1) sinh (i -

. 1) n

We now use (5.3) to determine the asymptotic behaviour of the n. For large values of n we can simplify our calculations below by noting that

tanh (i + 1) n =

sinh (i + 1) n cosh (i + 1) n

=

e(i+1)n - e-(i+1)n e(i+1)n + e-(i+1)n

= 1 + O (e-2n ),

so

(5.4)

tanh (i + 1) n  1.

We proceed now to estimate the right-hand side of (5.3). Consider first the numerator. A straightforward calculation using (5.2) and (5.4) shows that for large n

cosh (i + 1) n + cosh (i - 1) n

 cosh (i + 1) n (cosh (i + 1) n - cosh (i - 1) n + sinh (i + 1) n + sinh (i - 1) n)

= cosh (i + 1) n (e(i+1)n - e-(i-1)n )

= 2en sinh in cosh (i + 1) n.

Likewise the denominator in the right-hand side of (5.3) can be written as

(i + 1) sinh (i + 1) n + (i - 1) sinh (i - 1) n

 cosh (i + 1) n [(i + 1) (sinh (i + 1) n + cosh (i + 1) n) - (i - 1) (sinh (i - 1) n - cosh (i - 1) n)]

= cosh (i + 1) n [(i + 1) e(i+1)n + (i - 1) e-(i-1)n ]

= 2en (sinh in + i cosh in) cosh (i + 1) n.

So the right-hand side of (5.3) becomes

cosh (i + 1) n + cosh (i - 1) n (i + 1) sinh (i + 1) n + (i - 1) sinh (i - 1) n



sinh in sinh in + i cosh in

from which it is clear that n is bounded for large |n|. Thus, asymptotically, we can write (5.3) as

-n 2 ( + i2n)



n.

To see how the left-hand side of (5.3) behaves asymptotically we observe that

Step 1. First the zeros of the following equation are determined:

µ3 sinh µ1 cosh µ3 - µ1 cosh µ1 sinh µ3 = 0.

We substitute µ3 = i and µ1 =  into this equation to obtain

(5.7)

i sinh  cosh i - cosh  sinh i = 0.

A formal manipulation using

2i sinh  cosh i - 2 cosh  sinh i = i (sinh (i + 1)  - sinh (i - 1) ) - sinh (i + 1)  - sinh (i - 1) 

= (i - 1) sinh (i + 1)  - (i + 1) sinh(i - 1)

shows that (5.7) is equivalent to

i=

sinh (i - 1)  sinh (i + 1) 

=

e(i-1) - e-(i-1) e(i+1) - e-(i+1)

=

-

e-2i - e-2 1 - e-2(i+1)

= -e-2i + O (e-2).

The zeros are where n = O (e-2n ). In this case

(5.8)

sinh (i - 1) n sinh (i + 1) n

=

i,

cosh (i - 1) n cosh (i + 1) n

=

-i (1 + O (e-2n )).

On the other hand, we know that

(5.9)

tanh (i + 1) n = 1 + O (e-2n ).

In the next step we will use (5.8) and (5.9) to simplify our calculations. Step 2. Let the sequence {n} represent the zeros of H (). We proceed as in Step 2 of the previous subsection, setting
n = n + n, n  Z,
with the n yet to be determined, and letting

µ3 - µ1 = (i - 1) n,

µ3 + µ1 = (i + 1) n.

Then

µ3 = in, µ23 = -2n, µ1 = n, µ21 = 2n,
n = µ1µ3 = i2n.

Using these relations in (4.8), we obtain

H (n) = -22n sinh n sinh in + ( + i2n) (in sinh n cosh in - n cosh n sinh in) .

The characteristic equation H (n) = 0 then reads

-2n sinh n sinh in + ( + i2n) (i sinh n cosh in - cosh n sinh in) = 0,

which is equivalent to

(5.10)

=

.

Let us estimate the right-hand side of (5.10) and begin with the numerator. Using (5.8) and (5.9), we

obtain after some straightforward computations

2i sinh n cosh in - 2 cosh n sinh in = (i - 1) cosh (i + 1) n (cosh (i + 1) n - cosh (i - 1) n + sinh (i + 1) n + sinh (i - 1) n) + O (e-n ) = (i - 1) cosh (i + 1) n (e(i+1)n - e-(i-1)n ) + O (e-n ) = 2en (i - 1) sinh in cosh (i + 1) n + O (e-n ), Likewise, considering the denominator in the right-hand side of (5.10),

2 sinh n sinh in

= cosh (i + 1) n (cosh (i + 1) n + i cosh (i - 1) n + sinh (i + 1) n - i sinh (i - 1) n) + O (e-n )

= cosh (i + 1) n (e(i+1)n + ie-(i-1)n ) + O (e-n )

= -en (i - 1) (sinh in + i cosh in) cosh (i + 1) n + O (e-n ).

Thus, for large n, the right-hand side of (5.10) becomes

i sinh n cosh in - cosh n sinh in sinh n sinh in

and so, asymptotically, we obtain for n, by arguments similar to those given in Section 5.1 (in Step

Step 3. A calculation entirely analogues to that in Step 3 leading to (5.6) shows that the asymptotic

expression as |n|   for the n here is

O (-n 2).

The results developed in this section so far together with Theorem 4.1 prove the following theorem.

Theorem 5.1. The pencil P () has two branches of eigenvalues {n}nZ which can be correctly enumerated in the sense of Definition 3.3. The asymptotic behaviour of the sequence of eigenvalues

belonging to the first branch 1 (P ) of the spectrum is specified by

and the asymptotic behaviour of the sequence of eigenvalues belonging to the second branch 2 (P ) is

specified by

2,n

where n = O (e-2n).

5.3. Multiplicity of eigenvalues. We shall now determine the multiplicity of each eigenvalue of the pencil P (). For this it is useful to characterise the adjoint T  of the system operator T , where T is
as defined by (2.6), (2.7).

Lemma 5.1. The adjoint T  of T in X is given by

 

wj  W24 (0, 1)  W^ 22 (0, 1) ,
3

 (0, 1) ,

D (T ) = y =

(wj(3) (0) - wj

(0)) = 0, j = 1, 2, 3



18

and

(T y) (s) = -

vj (s) , -wj(4) (s) + wj(2) (s)

3 j=1

,

y  D (T ) .

Proof. Noting that T x, y X = x, T y X for x  D (T ) and y  D (T ), the proof is a straightforward calculation using integration by parts (and is therefore omitted).

Before proving the next theorem, let us derive an intermediate result. Since X is a Hilbert space it follows that  (P ) =  (P ), where P  () := P (). Let    (P ) and µ   (P ) with corresponding eigenvectors x (, s) and y (µ, s), respectively. Then, because

we have

P () x () , y (µ) X = (I - T ) x () , y (µ) X = 0,

 x () , y (µ) X = T x () , y (µ) X = x () , T y (µ) X = x () , µy (µ) X = µ x () , y (µ) X

and so x () , y (µ) X = 0 for  = µ. As a result we need only consider the case where  = µ. Let us

write

x (, s) =

wj (, s) , vj (, s)

3 j=1

,

y (, s) =

wj (, s), vj (, s)

3 j=1

.

Now, consider the problem

-vj (s) = wj (s) , s  (0, 1) , j = 1, 2, 3,

wj(4) (s) - wj(2) (s) = vj (s) ,

s  (0, 1) , j = 1, 2, 3,

wj (1) = wj(2) (1) = 0,

j = 1, 2, 3,

wj (0) - wk (0) = 0,

j, k = 1, 2, 3,

wj(2) (0) - wj (0) + vj (0) = 0,

j = 1, 2, 3,

3
(wj(3) (0) - wj (0)) = 0,
j=1
which can be equivalently written as
wj(4) (s) - wj(2) (s) = -2wj (s) ,

s  (0, 1) , j = 1, 2, 3,

wj (1) = wj(2) (1) = 0,

j = 1, 2, 3,

wj (0) - wk (0) = 0,

j, k = 1, 2, 3,

wj(2) (0) - ( + ) wj (0) = 0,

j = 1, 2, 3,

3
(wj(3) (0) - wj (0)) = 0.
j=1

It follows from the results of Section 4 that if

x (, s) =

wj (, s) , vj (, s)

3 j=1

=

wj (, s) , wj (, s)

3 j=1

is an eigenvector of P () = I - T corresponding to the eigenvalue , then

y (, s) =

wj (, s), -wj (, s)

3 j=1

is an eigenvector of the adjoint pencil P  () = I - T  corresponding to the eigenvalue , and

wj (, s) = wj (, s). Take the inner product of x (, s) with y (, s). This yields, on integrating by parts and employing the boundary and connectivity conditions,

3

31

x () , y () X = - (wj (, 0))2 +

wj (, s) (wj(4) (, s) - wj(2) (, s)) ds

We know the differential equation wj(4) (s) - wj(2) (s) = -2wj (s) for j = 1, 2, 3. Thus

(5.11)

3

31

x () , y () X = - (wj (, 0))2 - 22

(wj (, s))2ds.

j=1

j=1 0

We can now state and prove our main result of this subsection.

Theorem 5.2. Each eigenvalue   1 (P ) has algebraic multiplicity 1, and so is simple in the sense of Definition 3.2. Each eigenvalue   2 (P ) is semisimple and its algebraic multiplicity is equal to 2. Hence there are no associated vectors corresponding to any eigenvalue of P ().

Proof. We consider again the two cases as in Section 4. Case 1. Let us recall from Theorem 4.1 that wj (, s) := cw (, s) with

w (, s) = µ1 cosh µ3 sinh µ1 (1 - s) - µ3 cosh µ1 sinh µ3 (1 - s) .

In this case (5.11) becomes

1
x () , y () X = 3c2 -22 (w (, s))2ds -  (w (, 0))2 ,
0
and we calculate for the term in brackets (after some computations)

(5.12)

- 22 (w (, s))2ds -  (w (, 0))2

-  (µ23 - µ21)2 cosh2 µ1 cosh2 µ3 + 2 (µ21 cosh2 µ3 + µ23 cosh2 µ1).

Proceeding as before, we set

µ3 = i, µ23 = -2, µ1 = , µ21 = 2,
 = µ1µ3 = i2.

On substituting in the right-hand side of (5.12) and rearranging, we obtain

1
- 22 (w (, s))2ds -  (w (, 0))2
0
= -5 cosh  cosh i (sinh  cosh i + i cosh  sinh i)
- 25 cosh  cosh i (sinh  cosh i + i cosh  sinh i + 2i cosh  cosh i)
- 6 (cosh2  + cosh2 i).

Since D () = 0, we also have from (4.6)

So

= -5 cosh  cosh i (sinh  cosh i + i cosh  sinh i) + 44 cosh2  cosh2 i

- 6 (cosh2  + cosh2 i)

and there results

x () , y () X = 3c2 -22 (w (, s))2ds -  (w (, 0))2 = 0.

Case 2. Now, for each   2 (P ) we know from Theorem 4.1 that the corresponding eigenvector is of the form
x (, s) = ax1 (, s) + bx2 (, s)
for some a, b  C, where

x1 (, s) = -2 1,  , 1,  , 1,   (, s) , x2 (, s) = 0, 0 , 1,  , - 1,   (, s) ,

and

 (, s) = sinh µ3 sinh µ1 (1 - s) - sinh µ1 sinh µ3 (1 - s) .

In this case we consider H () = 0, and it follows from (4.8) that

We find by arguments analogous to those given in Case 1 that x () , y () X = 0 here also.

6. Completeness, minimality, and Riesz basis property

In this section the completeness, minimality, and Riesz basis properties of the eigenvectors of the system operator T are investigated. As we have already indicated in the introduction, The proofs use results from the literature, which we collect here as a convenience for the reader. The first, Theorem 6.1, is on the completeness of the eigen- and associated vectors and is actually a sharper version of [7, Theorem V.8.1], as detailed in [7, Section V.8]. The second (seemingly well known) result, Theorem 6.2, is on the minimality property. Its proof may be found, for example, in [13]. The last result we shall use, Theorem 6.3, is merely a restatement of [22, Theorem 1.1] on the Riesz basis property (with parentheses). We refer the reader to the books [7, 14, 23] for definitions of completeness, minimality, Riesz bases, and so on (and further details concerning various tests for these).

Theorem 6.1 (Keldysh). Let K be a compact skewadjoint operator on X with ker K = {0}, and let S be a real operator on X which has finite rank. Let

A = K + S

for   0. Then the eigen- and associated vectors of the operator A are complete in X.

Theorem 6.2. Let A be a compact operator on X and ker A = {0}. Then the eigen- and associated vectors of A are minimal in X.

Theorem 6.3 (Xu and Yung). Let A be the infinitesimal generator of a C0-semigroup {S (t)}t0 of bounded linear operators on X. Suppose that the following conditions hold:

(i)  (A) = 1 (A) 2 (A) where 2 (A) is discrete and hence consists only of eigenvalues {k}kN of finite type, which satisfy the separation condition infk=j |k - j| > 0;
(ii) sup {Re  |   1 (A)}  m  inf {Re  |   2 (A)} for some real constant m; (iii) supkN dim E (k, A) X < , the E (k, A) being the spectral or Riesz projections associated
with the eigenvalues k.
Then the following statements hold:

(1) There exist two S (t)-invariant closed subspaces X1 and X2, in the sense that S (t) X1  X1

and S (t) X2  X2, with the properties

(i)  (A|X1 ) = 1 (A) and  (A|X2 ) = 2 (A); and

(ii) {E (k, A) X2}kN forms a Riesz basis with parentheses for X2, and X = X1  X2.

(2) If supkN E (k, A) < , then D (A)  X1  X2  X.
n

(3) X has the decomposition X = X1  X2 if and only if supkN

E (k, A) < .

k=1

Remark 6.1. It follows from the denseness of (the domain of ) A and the compactness of its resolvent function (I - A)-1 implicit in Theorem 6.3 that the Hilbert space X must be separable. Further, the range E (, A) X of the Riesz projection E (, A) associated with an eigenvalue  should not be confused with the geometric interpretation of ker (I - T ) as the eigenspace corresponding to . In fact from Definition 3.2 it is not difficult to see that the range dimension dim E (, A) X coincides with the definition of the algebraic multiplicity of  (see [5, Chapter VII] for details).

STRETCHED EULER­BERNOULLI BEAM ON STAR GRAPH

21

To use Theorem 6.1, our proof of the completeness of the eigenvectors of the system operator T shall be based on a particular construction of its inverse T -1, as shown in the next lemma.

Lemma 6.1. Let T0 be the skewadjoint part of T , that is, the operator T with  = 0. Then T -1 = T0-1 + S, where S is a real operator on X which has finite rank.

Proof. We employ some of the results from the proof of Lemma 3.1 for the solutions of (3.1), and begin by noting from (3.7) that on setting

b (h) =

3 j=1

Hj (0) +

1 0

 sinh  r +  cosh  r

 sinh  +  cosh 

Hj (r) dr

,

b (g) =  sinh 3j+=1gj (0c)osh  ,

we can write (3.6) as

3
aj = b (h) + b (g) .
j=1

Thus (3.8) becomes 

w (0)

hj (s) ds =: c (h) + c (g) ,

where

It can be shown by a straightforward calculation that then (3.9) is equivalent to

(6.1) aj sinh  - (wj(3) (0) - wj (0))

1 (1 - r) sinh  r dr = F11 (h) + F12 (g) ,

Since the determinant equation is exactly the same as in the proof of Lemma 3.1, the system (6.1) has
a unique solution pair aj, wj(3) (0) - wj (0). The solutions aj and wj(3) (0) - wj (0) are proportional, respectively, to

aj =

and

wj(3) (0) - wj (0) =

F11 (h) + F12 (g) .
F21 (h) + F22 (g)

So we can write aj = aj (h) + aj (g) , wj(3) (0) - wj (0) = wj(3) (0, h) - wj (0, h) +  (wj(3) (0, g) - wj (0, g)).

.

Here the aj (g) and wj(3) (0, g) - wj (0, g) are bounded linear functionals on W^ 22 (0, 1). Obviously the operator S is a bounded linear operator on X of rank 2, and from Lemma 3.2 it is readily verified that

Re T x, x X = Re T -1y, y X = Re (T0-1 + S) y, y X =  Sy, y X

with T x = y, where x  D (T ). This completes the proof.

Combining Lemma 6.1 with Theorems 6.1 and 6.2, we obtain the following result guaranteeing the completeness and minimality of the eigenvectors (recall from Theorem 5.2 that T has no associated vectors).

Theorem 6.4. The eigenvectors of T are minimal complete in X.
Proof. The proof of completeness is immediate, if we identify A and K in Theorem 6.1 with T -1 and T0-1, respectively, and note that the eigenvectors of T -1 are also eigenvectors of T . So, by definition of completeness, span {E (, T ) X |    (T )} = X. The proof of the minimality property is then also immediate from applying Theorem 6.2 with A = T -1.

The above results culminate in the following theorem. Theorem 6.5. The eigenvectors of T form a Riesz basis with parentheses for X.

Proof. We identify A in Theorem 6.3 with T and take 2 (T ) =  (T ) and 1 (T ) = {}. It follows from Theorems 5.1 and 5.2 that the conditions (i) to (iii) of Theorem 6.3 are satisfied. In particular,
since span {E (, T ) X |   2 (T )} = X2, the sequence of eigenvectors of T is a Riesz basis with parentheses for X2. Hence, by means of Theorem 6.4, we can infer that the sequence of eigenvectors forms in fact a Riesz basis with parentheses for X (because X = X2).

7. Stability
The following theorem, which is the final result of the paper, is a direct consequence of the fact, verified in Theorem 6.5, that T satisfies the spectrum determined growth assumption.
Theorem 7.1. Consider (AIVP), whose solution is given by (3.11) for x0  D (T ). If  > 0, then the estimate (2.8) is satisfied, and consequently the solution decays exponentially to zero as t  .

STRETCHED EULER­BERNOULLI BEAM ON STAR GRAPH

23

Proof. By Theorem 6.5, the initial state x0 can be expanded in a Riesz basis with parentheses of eigenvectors. Thus the solution (3.11) of (AIVP) can be represented in series form. A standard argument using [7, Section VI.2.(2.4)] then applies to show that (2.8) holds. That sup {Re  |    (T )} < - follows from Theorem 5.1. The proof is complete.
