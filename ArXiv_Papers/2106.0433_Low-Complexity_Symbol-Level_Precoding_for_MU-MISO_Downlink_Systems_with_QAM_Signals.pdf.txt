Abstract--This study proposes the construction of a transmit signal for large-scale antenna systems with cost-effective 1-bit digital-to-analog converters in the downlink. Under quadratureamplitude-modulation constellations, it is still an open problem to overcome a severe error floor problem caused by its nature property. To this end, we first present a feasibility condition which guarantees that each user's noiseless signal is placed in the desired decision region. For robustness to additive noise, we formulate an optimization problem, we then transform the feasibility conditions to cascaded matrix form. We propose a lowcomplexity algorithm to generate a 1-bit transmit signal based on the proposed optimization problem formulated as a well-defined mixed-integer-linear-programming. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of detection performance and computational complexity.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, massive multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems have been actively investigated as a core technology in fifth-generation (5G) and future wireless communication systems due to its significant gain in spectral efficiency [1]. One of the key challenges is dealing with a high hardware cost caused by a large number of radio frequency (RF) chains which consist of nearly linear power amplifiers (PA) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs) for each antenna element. In massive MISO systems, the total power consumption at BS is increased by the number of the RF chains. Moreover, in downlink systems, the power consumption from the PAs and DACs accounts for the majority of the total power consumption at BS. Therefore, the use of power-efficient lowresolution DACs has gathered momentum as a promising low-power solution in a variety of application spaces [2]­ [4]. In traditional downlink systems, zero-forcing (ZF) and regularized ZF (RZF) achieve almost optimal performance effectively [5]. These linear precoding schemes with low complexity are widely used in wireless communication with nearly linear PAs and high-resolution DACs (e.g., 12 bits). Unfortunately, power consumption grows exponentially with the number of quantization bits. For this reason, massive MISO must be built with low-cost DACs.
Non-linear precoding methods are based on various design criteria such as minimum mean square error (MMSE), con-

structive Interference (CI), maximum safety margin (MSM). For phase-shift-keying (PSK) and quadrature-amplitudemodulation (QAM) constellations, the methods for MMSE criterion are introduced in [6]­[11]. In [6], C1PO, C2PO method is proposed as a low-complexity algorithm variant from using bi-convex relaxation. Unfortunately, these methods do not provide good performance with QAM constellations. In [7], nonlinear 1-bit precoding methods are enabled by semi-definite relaxation and -norm relaxation. However, these methods do not provide an elegant complexity-performance trade-off. In [10], The MMSE-based one-bit precoding, MMSE-ERP is developed by a combination of the alternating minimization method using a projected gradient method, and equilibrium constraint. The performance of MMSE-ERP is significant. Also, [11] provides the IDE algorithm and IDE2 which is a complexity-efficient algorithm of IDE that exploits an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Both IDE and IDE2 achieve excellent error-rate performance.
The CI design criterion is similar to our one. [12]­[15] propose symbol-level precoding methods that utilize CI design criterion. In [13], a precoding method based on branch-andbound (B&B) is proposed in the massive MIMO systems with PSK constellations. Symbol scaling (SS) is the lowcomplexity algorithm that achieves good performance with PSK. In [12], [14], a partial branch and bound (P-BB) and an ordered partial sequential update (OPSU), based on the optimization problems defined with both equality constraints and inequality constraints achieve near-optimal performance and significant performance, respectively. In [16], MSM design criterion exploiting the CI and MSM algorithm and analysis of the algorithm are provided for constant envelope precoding with PSK and QAM. These methods do not provide an elegant complexity-performance trade-off since in QAM constellations, the decision regions are bounded. Thus, The major subject of this paper is to investigate a precoding method with a near-optimal performance and low complexity under QAM constellations.
In this paper, we design a novel direction to construct a 1-bit transmit signal vector for a downlink MU-MISO system with 1-bit DACs. A first key contribution is the socalled feasibility condition which guarantees that the noiseless observation of each user belongs to a desired decision region. If a transmit signal vector satisfy the feasibility condition, each users can detect a desired signal at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To combine the robustness to an additive noise into the feasibility condition, we transform our problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP), which can be

optimally solved via B&B. Furthermore, we present a lowcomplexity method to solve the MILP via a novel greedy algorithm, which yield the near optimal performance. Via numerical results, we show that the proposed method perform state-of-the-art performances. Moreover, the potential of the presented direction and methods is demonstrated by a runtime comparison of the 1-bit precoding methods.
This paper is organized as follows. We represent useful notations and definitions, and describe a system model in Section II. In Section III, we propose an design criterion using the feasibility condition to construct a transmit signal vector for downlink MU-MISO systems with 1-bit DACs. Moreover, in Section IV, the low complexity method are proposed. Section V demonstrates numerical results. Conclusions are provided in VI.

II. PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we provide useful notations used throughout the paper, and then describe the system model.

A. Notation

The uppercase and lowercase bold letters represent matrices and column vectors, respectively. For any vector x, xi represents the i-th component of x. The symbol (·)T denotes the transpose of a matrix or a vector. Let [a : b] = {a, a+1, . . . , b} for any integer a and b with a < b. The notation of card(U) denotes the number of elements of a finite set U. A rank of a matrix A is represented as rank(A). Re(a) and Im(a)
represent the real and complex parts of a complex vector a  C, respectively. For any x  C, we let

g(x) = [Re(x), Im(x)]T,

(1)

and g-1 denotes the inverse mapping of g. Also, g and g-1 are the component-wise operations, i.e., g([x1, x2]T) = [Re(x1), Im(x1), Re(x2), Im(x2)]T. For a complex-value x,
its real-valued matrix expansion (x) is defined as

(x) =

Re(x) -Im(x) Im(x) Re(x)

.

(2)

As an extension to a vector, the operation of  is applied in an element-wise manner as

([x1, x2]T) = [(x1)T, (x2)T]T.

(3)

 indicates Kronecker product operator, and 1¯n denotes the length-n all-one vector.

B. System Model

We consider a downlink of MU-MISO system. The BS

with Nt transmits antennas serves K single-antenna users with

infinite-resolution ADC, where Nt K. C denotes the set of

constellation points of 4n-QAM with n  2. For a standard

input-output

relation,

the

received

signal

vector

y



K
C

at

the K users is given as



y = Hx + z,

(4)

where x = [x1, . . . , xNt ]T represents a transmit vector at the BS and H  CK×Nt denotes the frequency-flat Rayleigh
fading channel whose each entry follows a complex Gaussian
distribution with zero mean and unit variance. The additive Gaussian noise vector z  CK×1 models i.i.d. circularly-
symmetric complex Gaussian noise with zero mean and unit variance per each entry, i.e., zi  CN (0, 2 = 1).  denotes the per-antenna power constraint and the SNR is defined as SNR = /2. Throughout the paper, we assume full channel
state information (CSI) at the BS. Given a message vector s  CK, we propose that BS
construct a transmit vector x such that each user k can recover
the desired message sk successfully. To this end, we aim to construct a symbol-level precoding function P as

x = P(H, s),

(5)

that produces a transmit vector x based on H and s. According to the one-bit constraint, each component xi is restricted as

Re(xi) and Im(xi )  {-1, 1}.

(6)

Due to a severe non-linearity from the restriction, conventional methods developed using the linearity cannot guarantee an attractive performance. Our goal is a precoding function P(H, s) with a suitable for the considered non-linearity and manageable complexity.

III. THE PROPOSED TRANSMIT-SIGNAL VECTORS

In this section, we present an optimization problem that constructs a transmit-vector x under 4n-QAM. This problem

can be rewritten as a manageable MILP. For the ease of

exploration, an equivalent real-valued expression is used as

y~ = H~ x~ + z~,

(7)

where x~ = g(x), x~ = g(x), z~ = g(z), and H~ = (H)  R2K×2Nt denotes the real-value matrix of H.
First, we provide the useful definitions which are used
throughout the paper.

Definition 1: (Decision region) For any constellation point s  C, the decision region of s is defined as

R(s) y  C : |y - s|  min |y - c| . (8)
cC:c=s

A received signal y is deteacted as s if y is in R(s). Also, the real-valued decision region is given as

R~(s) = g (R(s)) .

(9)

Definition 2: (Base region) A base region B~i  R2, i  [0 : 3], is defined as

B~i {i1m1i + i2m2i : i1, i2 > 0},

We then represent the decision region in Definition 1 as an

intersection of the n base regions in Definition 2 with proper

offsets. First of all, we need to decide a decision-size  =

, dmin
2

where

dmin

represents

the

minimum

Euclidean

distance

of the given constellation points. In PSK,  is always infinite

regardless of a channel, whereas in 4n-QAM, it should be

optimized. Specifically, if a noiseless received signal belongs

to the desired decision regions at all the K users,  should be

as large as possible to guarantee reliable performance.

From now on, we explain how to construct a transmit-signal vector x for a given decision-size  . Throughout the paper, it is assumed that all K users' decision-size  are identical for the practicability of an optimization. Given 4n-QAM, each symbol is indexed by a length-n quaternary vector (i1, ..., in) with ij  [0 : 3]. The following constellation C and real-valued form C~ are respectively represented as

C = sn(0,...,0), sn(0,...,1), . . . , sn(3,...,3) , C~ = g(sn(0,...,0)), g(sn(0,...,1)), . . . , g(sn(3,...,3)) .

(12) (13)

Each constellation point can be represented as a normalized

constellation point, (i.e., a linear combination of the n basis

symbols ci's) with  such as

sn(i1 ,...,in )

for i  [0 : 3]. We aims a transmit vector x to ensure that a noiseless received signal at the k-th user (i.e., rk = hkx, where hk is k-th row of H) should be placed in the corresponding decision regions for all users k  [1 : K]. This essential condition implies that x should satisfy the following condition:

g(rk)  R~

sn
(µk,1 ,...,µk,n )

,

(16)

for k  [1 : K].

Feasibility condition: To reform the condition (16) as n linear equations, we first represent the decision region in (16) as the intersections of the n shifted base regions in Definition 2:

R~ sn(i1,...,in)

n
B~i1
l=2

B~il + 2n-(l-1)g

sl(-i11,...,il-1 )

,

(17)

where the shifted base region is defined as

B~i + c {i1m1i + i2m2i + c : i1, i2 > 0}, (18)

with a bias c. Then, the condition in (16) is established when g(rk) expressed by the following n linear equations with some positive coefficients, i.e.,

g (rk )

for some k1,1, k2,1, . . . , k1,n, k2,n  0. The condition in (19) is called a feasibility condition. Satisfying the condition

ensures that all K users can detect the desired messages

in the high SNR regime, i.e., rk

R

sn
(µk,1 ,...,µk,n )

for

k  [1 : K].

We now represent the feasibility condition in a matrix form. Define the n copies of the channel vector hk as

Hk = 1¯n  hk = [hTk , . . . , hTk ]T.

(20)

n

The corresponding real-valued channel is represented as

H~ k = (Hk).

(21)

Accordingly, the n-extended received vector of k-th user is denoted as

rk g(Hkx) = H~ kx~ = 1¯n  g(rk).

(22)

Then, The right-hand side of (19), i.e., linear constraints, is represented in a matrix form. Using Definition 2, we let:

Mi

[m1i m2i ] =

Re(ci) 0 0 Im(ci)

,

(23)

which is a orthogonal and symmetric matrix. For whole message of k-th user, µk, we now pack each message terms from n linear equations (19) to a more manageable format. The basis matrix Mµk , coefficient vector k are respectively
represented as

Mµk diag(Mµk,1 , . . . , Mµk,n ),

(24)

k [k1,1, k2,1, . . . , k1,n, k2,n]T.

Robustness: Unfortunately, a feasible transmit vector cannot

guarantee robustness to the additive Gaussian noise despite

providing attractive performance in higher SNR. Thus, we

formulate an optimization problem aiming to move away the

noiseless signal from the boundaries of the decision areas as

P1 :

(35)

s.t. ¯ = x~ -  b, k1,j, k2,j > 0, j  [1 : n], k  [1 : K], x~  {-1, 1}2Nt .

To solve the problem P1 efficiently, we express P1 as MILP:

P2 :

argmax t

x~,t

s.t.

ix~ -  b,i  t, i  [1 : 2nK],

t > 0,

x~  {-1, 1}2Nt ,

(36)

where i and b,i represent the i-th row of  and b, respectively. We remark the fact that the object function t is the maximized lower bound of the coefficients ¯ from P2. The coefficients directly indicate how far away it is from a
detection boundary. Based on this facts, we set t to proper  , i.e.,  = t. Accordingly, the MILP problem to the decision-

t > 0,

x~  {-1, 1}2Nt .

(37)

Although the widely used B&B method for the MILP can solve the proposed MILP problem in P3 [13], this method is not appropriate due to its infeasible complexity in realistic implementation [13].
Remark 1: Fig. 2 clearly shows the proposed approach, where 104 normalized noiseless signals, i.e., Hx, are plotted with Nt = 8, K = 2, and 42-QAM. The blue points describe the noiseless received signals from unquantized transmit vectors using ZF precoding without 1-bit constraint in [5]. In contrast, the red points depict the noiseless received signals from the proposed 1-bit transmit vectors, i.e., the solutions of P3. Fig. 2 demonstrates that the red points can provide more robustness than the blue points even with the low-resolution data converters.

IV. LOW-COMPLEXITY PRECODING METHOD
In this section, we propose efficient algorithm to solve MILP problems in P3. First of all, the integer constraint in P3 is relaxed as the bounded interval not to loose convexity:

P4 :

argmax t

x~,t

s.t.

(38)

The relaxed LP problem, P4 can be solved efficiently via simplex method [17]. Here, x~LP denotes the solution of P4. We refine x~LP obtained by P4 to satisfy the 1-bit constraints via a full greedy algorithm, which is summarized in Algorithm 1. Furthermore, we note that finding x~LP via simplex method

Algorithm 1 Greedy Algorithm
Input: x~LP  R2Nt×1,   R2nK×2Nt , b  R2nK×1 and   R+. Initialization: x~ = x~LP (obtained by P4).

end for Output: x~  R2Nt×1
explores an extreme point of constraint set of P4. Due to the fact that extreme points are basic feasible solutions, most entries of x~LP already satisfy 1-bit constraint. In addition, pivoting of the simplex method depends on the rank of standard LP's constraint matrix. From [18], the rank() is equal to the rank of LP constraints of the proposed method, which is 2K. Therefore, complexity of LP almost depends on the number of users K. To verify the fact, we demonstrate the run-time simulation in Fig. 5.
V. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we validate the superiority of the proposed method over existing methods in terms of symbol-error-rate (SER) and computational complexity.
In Figs. 3 and 4, ZF is the conventional ZF method with infinite-resolution DACs by the lower-bound of the 1bit precoding methods. Quantized zero forcing (QZF) and Quantized LP (QLP) are the direct 1-bit quantization of ZF and 1-bit quantization of the solution from P4, respectively. Also, the efficient and excellent 1-bit precoding methods, such as SS [15], P-BB, OPSU [12], SQUID [7], C1PO, C2PO [6], IDE [11], ADMM-Leo [19], MSM method [16] and MMSE-ERP [10] are compared with the proposed method, full greedy(namely, F-greedy) based LP from Algorithm 1. Respectively, all benchmarks follow parameter settings in [6], [7], [10]­[12], [15], [16], [19] throughout the simulations.
Fig. 3 presents the performance comparisons of the MUMISO case with Nt = 64, K = 8, 42-QAM, and adaptive  . An optimal performance is obtained from the ZF methods with infinite-resolution data converters, which is interpreted as the lower-bound of the 1-bit methods. Unfortunately, due to unfeasible complexity, the performance of MILP cannot be evaluated. At high SNR, except for LP-based methods, most 1-bit precoding methods including QLP (i.e., solving P4) suffer from a severe error-floor. Therefore, to maintain the feasibility and robustness with 1-bit constraint, we add the proposed algorithm IV (namely, F-greedy). The proposed method achieves the near-optimal performance, which implies that  from the P4 is close to optimal. We note that the P-BB and OPSU methods search fewer candidates than our algorithm, thereby having a minor performance loss. In detail, our optimization problem can express all candidates in the decision region as an intersection of n base regions with

Fig. 5 shows the run-time comparison of the methods with 104 simulations. In Fig. 5, the novelty of our algorithm is demonstrated when having large-scale antennas arrays. In detail, run-time of the proposed method is about 10 times less than P-BB, but the SER performance turn out to be the same as P-BB with near-optimal performance. In addition, since the computational complexity of the simplex method that solves P4 mainly hinges on the number of users, the run-time of the proposed method growing with number of antennas is caused by greedy algorithm IV, which track all entries of the transmit vector. Although this problem, the run-time of our method is still quite small. the complexity problem is solved in [18].
We investigate the robustness of the proposed algorithm to

VI. CONCLUSION
We have presented the construction of 1-bit transmit signal vector for downlink MU-MISO systems with QAM constellations. We define the linear feasibility conditions which guarantee that each user's noiseless received signal can be successfully detected as the desired message. Also, the problem is transformed into the cascaded matrix form and further constructed as MILP problem. Solving MILP, 1-bit transmit signal vector with satisfying the feasibility conditions and the robustness to an additive noise. To efficiently solve MILP, we proposed the LP-relaxed algorithm that solve relaxed LP and refine the LP solution to satisfy 1-bit constraint. Via numerical results, the proposed method is demonstrated

superior performances with low-complexity compared with the
benchmarks. For a more thorough discussion, please see [18].
