On the Polyhedrality of the Chv´atal-Gomory Closure
Haoran Zhu 
Abstract
In this paper, we provide an equivalent condition for the Chv´atal-Gomory (CG) closure of a closed convex set to be finitely-generated. Using this result, we are able to prove that, for any closed convex set that can be written as the Minkowski sum of a compact convex set and a closed convex cone, its CG closure is a rational polyhedron if and only if its recession cone is a rational polyhedral cone. As a consequence, this generalizes and unifies all the currently known results, for the case of rational polyhedron [24] and compact convex set [9]. Key words: Chv´atal-Gomory closure · polyhedral · cutting-planes
1 Introduction
Cutting-plane method is one of the most fundamental techniques for solving (mixed) integer programming problems, and often times in practice, it is combined with the branch-and-bound method. Since the early days of Integer Programming (IP), numerous types of cutting-planes have been introduced and studied in the literature, several of them have also been widely implemented into commercial solvers. Among those cuts, Chv`atal-Gomory (CG) cut ([18, 5]) was the first cuttingplane that has ever been proposed, and various interesting results have been obtained from both the theoretical and practical point of view (see, e.g., [6, 3, 15]).
One of the theoretical questions regarding to CG cut is, what are the structural properties of the region obtained from intersecting all of those cuts? In the terminology of cutting-plane theory, this region is referred to as Chv`atal-Gomory (CG) closure. Although the definition of CG cut has traditionally been defined with respect to a rational polyhedron for an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem, they straightforwardly generalize to the nonlinear setting and hence can be used for convex Integer Nonlinear Programming (INLP). Let K be a closed convex set and let K denote the support function of K : K (c) = supxK cx. For the ease of notation, here we abbreviate the inner product cT x as cx. Given c  Zn, the CG cut for K that is derived from c is defined as: cx  K(c). Then, the so-called CG closure of K is:
K := {x  Rn | cx  K(c)}.
cZn
Here the CG closure K is essentially obtained from the intersection of potentially infinitely many half-spaces, hence the polyhedrality of K is unclear. As named in [1], here we call K is finitelygenerated, if there exists a finite set F  Zn, such that K = fF {x  Rn | f x  K (f )}. Obviously, a finitely-generated CG closure is a rational polyhedron. Four decades ago, Schrijver [24] shows that, when K is a rational polyhedron, K is finitely-generated. Schrijver further asks the following question: when K is an irrational polytope, is K still a (rational) polytope?

As attempts to fully understand this question, a series of studies have been conducted for the polyhedrality of CG closure of various convex sets. In [12], Dey and Vielma show that, the CG closure of a bounded full-dimensional ellipsoid, described by rational data, is a rational polytope. In [8], Dadush, Dey and Vielma show the CG closure of a set obtained as an intersection of a strictly convex body and a rational polyhedron is a polyhedron. Along this line of work, in [9], the same group of authors extend the same result to compact convex sets, therefore giving affirmation answer to the long-standing open problem raised by Schrijver. Almost simultaneously this problem was also proved by Dunkel and Schulz [14] independently, where they specifically prove for the case of irrational polytope, instead of a more general compact convex set. All their proofs are very much involved, a few years later Braun and Pokutta [4] give a short proof for the same result as [9]. However, no matter how different these proofs might seem, they all share some highlevel similarities. For example, they all rely heavily on the homogeneity property of CG closure: F  = K  F for any face F of K. By inductive hypothesis that F  is rational polyhedral and some additional argument, they will be able to obtain the polyhedrality of K. As we will see later, in contrast to all these work in the literature, we are taking a completely different perspective and do not make use of the homogeneity property of CG closure. Key is here a characterization result for general cutting-plane closures from which a fundamental Theorem 1 is derived. We believe that the basic proof technique here lends itself to potentially many more classes of cutting-planes.
Now we highlight the main results of this paper in the next section.
1.1 Main Results
With respect to the CG closure of general closed convex set, we have the first main result:
Theorem 1. Given a closed convex set K in Rn, then K is finitely-generated if and only if there exists a finite subset F  Zn, such that {x  Rn | f x  K (f ), f  F }  K.
Based on this above theorem, we are able to prove the following result.
Theorem 2. If K is a Motzkin-decomposable set, then the following statements are equivalent:
1. K is a finitely-generated.
2. K is a rational polyhedron.
3. K has rational polyhedral recession cone.
Here a set K  Rn is called Motzkin-decomposable (see, e.g., [17, 20]), if there exist a compact convex set C and a closed convex cone D such that K = C + D. By Minkowski-Weyl theorem, a polyhedron is a Motzkin-decomposable set, thus the last theorem generalizes and unifies all the currently known results for rational polyhedron and compact convex set. Moreover, using the characterization result in [11] for the polyhedrality of integer hull, we can immediately obtain the next result as a corollary:
Corollary 1. If K is a Motzkin-decomposable set in Rn and contains integer points in its interior, then K is a rational polyhedron if and only if conv(K  Zn) is a polyhedron.
Here conv(K  Zn) is called the integer hull of K. As a footnote in [9], the authors wrote the following sentences to justify the reason why they focus on the case of a compact convex set:
" If the convex hull of integer points in a convex set is not polyhedral, then the CG closure cannot be expected to be polyhedral. Since we do not have a good understanding of when this holds for unbounded convex set, we restrict our attention here to the CG closure of compact convex sets. "
2

Therefore, our Corollary 1 directly addresses their concern. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present some characterizations for the
polyhedrality of general cutting-plane closure and some preliminary results that will be used later. In Section 3, we verify Theorem 1, and in Section 4, we verify Theorem 2 and Corollary 1.

Notations and assumptions. For any x  Rn and a linear subspace L  Rn, we denote by

projL x the orthogonal projection of x onto L, and for any X  Rn, projL X := {projL x | x  X}.

For any set S  Rn, lin(S) := S  (-S) denotes the lineality space of S, which is the largest

linear subspace contained in S. cone(S) := {

denotes

the conical hull of S, and (S)+ := {s |   0, s  S} denotes the cone that contains all non-

negative multiplication of elements in S. For a linear subspace L, we denote by L the orthogonal

complement of L. For a closed convex set K, rec(K) := {r | k + r  K, k  K,   0} denotes

the recession cone of K, and ext(K) denotes the set of extreme points of K. O(x) = {x  Rn | x - x  } denotes the -ball centered at x in its ambient space. Throughout, all norm ·

refers to the Euclidean norm. For a matrix M , we denote by ker(M ) the kernel of M .

2 Preliminary Results

The well-known Dickson's lemma will be used in our later proof, and it also played an important role in some other relevant closure papers, see, e.g., [1, 10, 28].
Lemma 1 (Dickson's lemma [13]). For any X  Nn, the partially-ordered set (poset) (X, ) has no infinite antichain.

In order theory, an antichain (chain) is a subset of a poset such that any two distinct elements in the subset are incomparable (comparable).
Now we define a new concept for the convergence of rays in a cone.

Definition 1. Given a sequence {i}iN that limi ii = , then we say {i}

 Rn and conically

For the conical convergence, we have the following easy result. Lemma 2. Given a sequence {i}iN  Rn such that i -c  and i -c  when i  , then there exists  > 0, such that  = .

Proof. By assumption, we know there exists {i}, {µi}  R+, such that ii  , µii  . Let

In a recent paper [28], the authors study the equivalent condition for a general cutting-plane closure to be polyhedral. In this section, we will follow the same notations and definitions as in [28], and exploit the characterization results therein to derive new results for CG closure. For the completeness of this paper, we will include the proofs for those results in the Appendix.
Given a family of cutting-planes x   for any (, )  , it is referred to as "a family of cuts given by ". Then the corresponding (cutting-plane) closure is defined as:

I () :=

{x  Rn | x  }.

(1)

(,)

Here without loss of generality (w.l.o.g.) we can assume that (0, . . . , 0, 1)  , since (0, . . . , 0, 1) corresponds to the trivial inequality 0 · x  1.
For the valid inequality of the closure, we have the following result.

3

Proposition 1 (Proposition 1 [28]). Given   Rn+1 containing (0, . . . , 0, 1), such that I () = . Then x   is a valid inequality to I () if and only if (, )  cl cone().

For any set S, we use cl(S) to denote the smallest closed set containing S, which is also called closure in topology. To avoid confusion, we will only use cl(S) to refer the topological closure. This above proposition immediately implies the following consequence.

Corollary 2. Given   Rn+1 containing (0, . . . , 0, 1) with I () = . Then I () is finitelygenerated if and only if there exists a finite subset ¯   such that cone(¯ ) = cl cone().

The proofs for both Proposition 1 and Corollary 2 can be found in Appendix A. From this above Corollary 2, we know that in order to show I () is finitely-generated, it suffices to show cl cone() is a polyhedral cone and can be generated by finitely many elements from . The next easy lemma is helpful for characterizing cl cone(). Here the  denotes the direct sum.

Lemma 3. For any   Rn, let L = lin(cl cone()). Then cl cone() = cl cone(projL )  L, where cl cone(projL ) is a pointed, closed convex cone.
Recall that a cone is called pointed if its lineality space is the origin. In order to prove such result, we will also require the following lemma.

Lemma 4 (fact 9 [26]). Given a non-empty closed convex cone K, K  lin(K) is a pointed cone and K = (K  lin(K))  lin(K).

Proof of Lemma 3. By Lemma 4, it suffices to show: cl cone(projL ) = cl cone() L. First, we want to show cl cone(projL )  cl cone()  L. The relation cl cone(projL )  cl cone(L) = L is obvious. Moreover, for any   , projL  =  - r, for some r  L. Hence projL    + L  cl cone() + cl cone() = cl cone(). Therefore, cl cone(projL )  cl cone(), which completes the proof of this  direction.
Then, we want to show that cl cone(projL )  cl cone()  L. Arbitrarily pick x  cl cone()  L. If x  cone(), then x = projL x  projL cone() = cone(projL ). If xi  x for a sequence of {xi}  cone(), then projL xi  x where projL xi  projL cone() = cone(projL ). Hence x  cl cone(projL ). This completes the proof.

It is well-known that, a pointed, closed convex cone is a polyhedral cone, if and only if it has finitely many different extreme rays. For a pointed cl cone(), its extreme rays can be exactly characterized by elements in , as stated by the next lemma. We include its proof in Appendix B.

Lemma 5 (Corollary 1, Lemma 3 [28]). Given   Rn+1 with (0, . . . , 0, 1)   and 0 / . If

cl cone() is pointed, then for any extreme different {ri}   such that ri -c r.

Henceforth, when we mention a ray r of a cone, we will make no distinction between r and its positive scalar multiplication. In other words, we say two rays r1 and r2 are different, if and only if there does not exist  > 0, such that r1 = r2.

3 Chv´atal-Gomory Closure of Closed Convex Set.

We will prove Theorem 1 in this section. For a given closed convex set K, we denote the family of CG cuts of K to be:

CG := {(0, . . . , 0, 1)}  {(c, K (c)), c  Zn}.

(2)

4

Then by definition of CG closure, there is K = I (CG). For ease of notation, when it is clear from the context, we will not specify what is the corresponding closed convex set K of CG. Throughout, a CG cut cx  K (c) will sometimes also be referred to as a vector (c, K (c)).
Before presenting the proof for the main Theorem 1, we will need the following lemmas.

Lemma 6 (Gordan's lemma). Given a lattice L  Zn and a rational polyhedral cone C  Rn.

Then there exists a finite set of lattice points {g1, . . . , gm}  C  L such that every point x  C  L

is an integer conical combination of these points: x =

m j=1

j gj ,

j



N

for

all

j



[m].

Here the finite generator {g1, . . . , gm} of C  L in the above lemma is usually referred to as the Hilbert basis of C (see, e.g., [7]). From Gordan's lemma we obtain the next result.

Lemma 7. Given a rational polyhedral cone C  Rn, a sequence of integer vectors {vi}iN  CZn, and a rational vector q  Qn. Then there must exist an infinite set I  N and i  N, such that for any i  I, vi - vi  C, and viq - viq = viq - viq.

Proof. By Lemma 6, we know there exist g1, . . . , gm  C  Zn, such that x  C  Zn if and only if

x can be written as the integer conical combination of these points. Therefore, for each vi, there

exists i  Nm such that vi =

m j=1

ij

gj

.

Folklore An infinite poset contains either an infinite chain or an infinite antichain.

Within the infinite poset  := {i}iN  Nm ordered by component-wise order , from the

Dickson's Lemma 1 and this above folklore, we know there must exist an infinite index set I  N,

such that {i}iI is an infinite chain within Nm.

Since

q

is

a

rational

vector,

we

can

write

it

as

q

:=

1 D

z,

where

z



Zn,

and

D

is

the

least

common multiple of the denominators of each q1, . . . , qn. So for any vi  Zn, viq can be written

as

1 D

where

Therefore,

{viq - viq

{0,

which

is

a

finite

set. Here I is an infinite index set, by the pigeonhole principle, there also exists another infinite

index set I  I, such that viq - viq = vjq - vjq for any i, j  I.

So far we have obtained an infinite index set I, such that for any i  I, vi =

m j=1

ijgj ,

{i}iI

is an infinite chain within Nm, and viq - viq = vjq - vjq for any i, j  I. Since {i}iI is an infinite chain within Nm, then there must exist i  I such that i is the least element

(a.k.a. minimum element) of {i}iI . Therefore, for any i  I, viq - viq = viq - vi q and i  i , which implies that vi - vi = mj=1(ij - ij )gj  C.

The next lemma states that, within any infinite sequence of CG cuts of K, there must exist a conically convergent subsequence which converges to a valid inequality of K.

Lemma 8. Given a exists a subsequence

closed convex set {(ri, K (ri))}iI

K and a sequence , such that when i

{(ri,  I,i

K(r,i)(r)i},iNK(ri)C)G-.c

Then there (r, r0) for

some valid inequality rx  r0 of K.

Proof. Picking i :=

1 (ri,K (ri))

for all i  N. Then i(ri, K (ri))  O1(0) which is a compact

set. By Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, we can find a convergent subsequence {i(ri, K (ri))}iI .

Denote i(ri, K (ri))  (r, r0). Since each ri  Zn, we know there exists an infinite subsequence

of {ri}iI such that ri  . W.l.o.g. we assume ri   when i  , since iri  r, then

there is i  0. Furthermore, because iK (ri)  r0 and i(K (ri)-1) < iK (ri)  iK(ri),

we know that iK(ri)  r0. Now we want to argue that rx  r0 is valid to K. If not, then there

exists x  K such that rx > r0. Denote  := rx - r0 > 0. Since i(ri, K (ri))  (r, r0), then

there

exist

Therefore, when i  N0:

irix - iK (ri)  rx -  x - r0 -  =  - (1 + x )

=

>

0.

This gives the contradiction since rix  K(ri) is valid to K.

Next we present the most crucial result for establishing the proof of the main theorem.

Proposition 2. Given a closed convex set K  Rn and a rational polyhedron P  K such that P = {x  Rn | f x  K(f ), f  F } for some finite set F  Zn. If {(ci, K (ci))}iN  CG is a sequence of vectors with P (ci) > K(ci) for any i  N, then there exist a finite set   CG and an infinite index set I  N, such that (ci, K (ci))  cone() for any i  I.

Proof. For each i  N, since P  K, there is P (ci)  K (ci) < , we know there exists extreme point pi of P , such that cipi = P (ci). So from the condition of this proposition, we have the following inequalities:
K (ci)  cipi = P (ci) > K (ci).
Hence cipi > K (ci) = cipi, for all i  N. This can be visualized in Fig. 1. Since the number of extreme points of polyhedron P is finite, by the pigeonhole principle, we know there exist a single extreme point p of P and an infinite subset I1  N, such that pi = p for any i  I1. Note that for a rational polyhedron P and an extreme point p  P , cip = P (ci) if and only if

ci  C := {x  Rn | (p - p)x  0 p  ext(P ), rx  0 r  rec(P )},

where C is a rational polyhedral cone. For the rational vector p and rational polyhedral cone C, by Lemma 7, we know there exist another infinite subset I  I1 and i  I1, such that for any i  I, ci - ci  C, and cip - cip = ci p - ci p. Now we denote
 := {(f, K (f )) f  F, (ci , K (ci )), (0, . . . , 0, 1)}.

Here we have   CG and  is a finite set.
Lastly, we want to show that the above constructed I and  satisfy the condition of this proposition, namely, for any i  I, there is (ci, K (ci))  cone(). By condition of I and i, we know ci - ci  C, which means (ci - ci)x  (ci - ci )p is valid to P . By definition of P , so this implies that (ci - ci , cip - cip)  cone({(f, K (f )) f  F, (0, . . . , 0, 1)}). Note that for any i  I, cip - cip = ci p - ci p, therefore:

(ci, K (ci)) = (ci, cip) = (ci , ci p) + (ci - ci , cip - ci p) = (ci , K (ci )) + (ci - ci , cip - ci p)  cone().

Hence we complete the proof.

The following is the last piece of result we will need to prove Theorem 1.

Figure 1: The red solid lines represent the CG cuts of K that cut off extreme point p, and the dashed red and blue lines represent the corresponding valid inequalities of K and P . Then these two CG cuts of K are also the CG cuts of P .

Proposition 3. Given a closed convex set K in Rn, and there exists a finite subset F  Zn, such that {x  Rn | f x  K (f ), f  F }  K. Then for any v  cl cone(CG), there exists a finite set v  CG, such that v  cone(v).

Proof. If v  cone(CG), then by Carath´eodory's theorem, there exists a finite subset   CG

with at most dim(CG) elements, such that v  cone().

If v / cone(CG), since v  L  cl cone(CG), we can find a sequence in cone(CG) converging

to v. Assume

for all i  N, j  [d]. Denote P = {x  Rn | f x  K (f ), f  F }, which is contained in K.

First, within the set {vi,1}iN  CG, there must exist an infinite index subset I1  N such

that CG cuts within {vi,1}iI1 are either all valid to P , or all invalid to P . If {vi,1}iI1 all correspond to valid inequalities of P , then {vi,1}iI1  cone({(f, K (f )) f  F, (0, . . . , 0, 1)}),

where {(f, K (f )) f  F, (0, . . . , 0, 1)}  CG. If they all correspond to invalid inequalities of

P , then by Proposition 2, there exists another infinite index set I¯1  I1 and finite set 1  CG,

such that vi,1  cone(1) for all i  I¯1. In other words, no matter whether CG cuts within {vi,1}iI1

are all valid to P or not, we can always find an infinite index set I¯1  I1 and finite set 1  CG,

such that argument

for all i  I¯2. After doing such argument for d times, eventually, we will obtain an infinite index

set I¯d  N and d finite sets 1, . . . , d  CG, such that vi,j  cone(j) for any i  I¯d, j  [d].

picking v := 1  . . .  d we conclude the proof.

Now we are ready to verify the main theorem in this section.

Proof of Theorem 1. It suffices for us to show the "if" direction: if there exists a finite subset F  Zn such that {x  Rn | f x  K (f ), f  F }  K, then K is finitely-generated. Denote P = {x  Rn | f x  K(f ), f  F }, and L = lin(cl cone(CG)).
By Lemma 3, cl cone(CG) = cl cone(projL CG)  L and cl cone(projL CG) is a pointed, closed convex cone. We start our argument by analyzing the extreme rays of cl cone(projL CG). By Lemma 5, any extreme ray of cl cone(projL CG) is either in (projL CG)+, or can be conically converged by elements from projL CG. Define  as the set of extreme rays of cl cone(projL CG)

7

that can be conically converged by elements from projL CG, and define  as the set of extreme rays of cl cone(projL CG) that are in (projL CG)+.
First we consider the set . Let (r, r0)  . By assumption of vectors in , we know there exists a sequence {(ri, K (ri))}iN  CG and {i}iN  R+, such that

i projL(ri, K (ri))  (r, r0) when i  .

there exists a subsequence {(ri, K for some valid inequality vx  v0

i(ri, K (ri))  (v, v0) when i  I, i  .

(4)

Here each i > 0. We can rewrite (4) as follows:

i projL(ri, K (ri)) + i projL(ri, K (ri))  (v, v0) when i  I, i  .

(5)

If (v, v0)  L, then for each i  I, take the inner product of both sides of (5) with the vectgpoerir(torjiLt,hi2iep(vrKcoo(,jnrvLit0)r)(a,r)dfiio,crtiioKn(v(,rIi,s),ivin0)c),e tfho(rris.,igrSi0vi)necs=Ie,utis0h.eri2eHipesnr,aoclejswLoe(vp(rsr,iiom,vj0Lp)lKy(/r(iro,ibL)t,a)Kian(2nrdti)hpa)rt0o-.cjpLrT(or(ojvLg,er,t(0vhr)0ei,,)rb=ywKiLt(0her.mi()3mF))raow-m2ce, we know (r, r0) =  projL(v, v0), for some  > 0. Since vx  v0 is valid to K, which contains P , so (v, v0)  cone(¯ ), where
¯  := {(f, K (f )) f  F, (0, . . . , 0, 1)}  CG.

From (r, r0 is arbitrary,

) =  projL(v, v0), in the end, we have

we also have (r, r0) shown   cone(pro

jLco¯ne)(,pfroorjLsom¯e)fi.nSitiencsue bhseerte¯(ro, fr0)CG.

Now we consider the other set . Assuming  contains infinitely many different extreme

rays of cl cone(projL CG): let {(ri, r0i )}iN   be one sequence of different extreme rays of cl cone(projL CG), where (ri, r0i ) = projL(ci, K (ci)) for CG cut cix  K (ci), ci  Zn. Since (ri, r0i ) is an extreme ray, then (ri, r0i ) / cone(projL ¯ ), so there is also (ci, K (ci)) / cone(¯ ). By Proposition 1 and definition of ¯ , this implies that inequality cix  K (ci) is not valid to

P , for any i  N. By Proposition 2, we know there exists a finite set   CG and an infinite set

I  N, such that (ci, K (ci))  cone() for any i  I. Hence (ri, r0i ) = projL (ci, K (ci)) 

projL cone() = cone(projL )  cone(projL CG). However, by our above assumption, for any i  I, (ri, r0i )   is extreme ray of cl cone(projL CG), we get the contradiction. So  can only contain finitely many different extreme rays of cl cone(projL CG). By assumption of , here we can find a finite subset ¯   CG, such that   cone(projL ¯ ).
So far, we have shown that, there exists finite subsets ¯  and ¯  of CG, such that     cone projL(¯   ¯ ) . Since    contains all the extreme rays of cl cone(projL CG), we

have:

cl cone(projL CG) = cone projL(¯   ¯ ) .

For the lineality space L, which is a subset of cl cone(), by Proposition 3, we can find a finite subset ¯ L  CG, such that L  cone(¯ L). Hence:

cl cone(CG) = cl cone(projL CG)  L  cone ¯   ¯   ¯ L .
Therefore, we obtain that: cl cone(CG) = cone ¯   ¯   ¯ L , where ¯ , ¯  and ¯ L are finite subsets of CG. By Corollary 2 we conclude the proof.

4 Chv´atal-Gomory Closure of Motzkin-Decomposable Set.
In this section, we will prove that, the CG closure of a Motzkin-decomposable set is a rational polyhedron if and only if it has rational polyhedral recession cone. Before presenting the proof for such main result, we first develop some intuition by examining the following examples. As we shall see in a moment, in some sense, the assumptions of Motzkin-decomposable is necessary.
Example 1. Consider closed convex set
K1 = {x  R2+ | x1 · x2  2},
see fig. 2a. Note that rec(K1) = R2+ a rational polyhedral cone, but K1 is not Motzkin-decomposable since there does not exist a compact convex set C such that K1 = C + R2+.
Moreover, K1 has integer hull
conv(K1  Z2) = {x  R2 | x1 + x2  3, x1  1, x2  1},
while K1 is not finitely-generated. To observe this, realize that conv(K1  Z2)  K1  K1 where rec(K1) = rec(conv(K1 Z2)) = R2+, so rec(K1 ) = R2+. If K1 is finitely-generated, then K1 will have facet-defining inequalities x1  1, x2  2 for some 1, 2  0, and inequalities x1  1, x2  2 are both CG cuts of K1. Clearly 1 = 2 = 1. However, there does not exist any fractional 1, 2  (0, 1), such that x1  1 and x2  2 are valid to K1, so x1  1, x2  1 cannot be CG cuts of K1, which means K1 is not finitely-generated.
Example 2. Consider another closed convex set
K2 = {x  R2 | (x1 - 0.2) · (x2 - 0.2)  2, x1 > 0.2, x2 > 0.2},
see fig. 2b. Note that K2 here can be obtained by translating the closed convex set K1 in Example 1. Here K2 is also not Motzkin-decomposable, and
conv(K2  Z2) = {x  R2 | x1 + x2  4, x1  1, x2  1}. 
However, x1  0.2, x2  0.2, x1 + x2  0.4 + 2 2 are all valid inequalities of K2, so x1  1, x2  1, x1 + x2  4 are CG cuts of K2. Therefore, K2 is finitely-generated.
Henceforth, we will only consider exposed faces of closed convex sets, and for the sake of brevity we refer to them as faces. In other words, a face F of a closed convex set K is a subset of the form F = {x  K | x = K ()} for some supporting hyperplane x = K(). We will call the face F the -face of K. Detailed definitions and properties of faces can be found in [25] and [2].
For any vector   Rn, we can associate an unique rational linear subspace V with it.
Definition 2. Given   Rn, define V := {x  Rn | T x = 0 for any   Qn such that T   Q}.
Lemma 9. Given a rational linear subspace L  Rn, and   L. Then V  L.
Proof. Let L := {x  Rn | Bx = 0}, where B  Qk×n. Then BT  = 0  Q, here B is the -th row of B. By Definition 2, we know V  {x  Rn | BT x = 0   [k]} = L.
For the rational linear subspace V associated with any vector   Rn, we have the following well-known simultaneous diophantine approximation theorem which is due to Kronecker [22]. Note that the version we used here is similar to the one used by [4]. We include its proof in Appendix C.

Lemma 10 ([22, 27, 4]). Let n, N0  N and   Rn with  = 0. Then Zn - Z>N0 contains a dense subset of V.
We will also require the following classic result about the sensitivity of Linear Programming.
Lemma 11 (Sticky face lemma [23]). If P is a polyhedron in Rn, x0 is a point of Rn and F is the set of maximizers of x0, · on P (a face of P ). Then for any x close enough to x0, the maximizers of x, · on P are just its maximizers on F .
4.1 Sufficient Condition
In this section, we want to establish the sufficient condition in Theorem 2, for finitely-generated property of the CG closure. Using the main Theorem 1, it suffices for us to show the following result.
Proposition 4. If K is a Motzkin-decomposable set in Rn with rational polyhedral recession cone, then there exists a finite subset F  Zn, such that {x  Rn | f x  K (f ), f  F }  K.
Before presenting the proof of Proposition 4, we will need the following auxiliary results. The first lemma can be viewed as an extension of the continuity Lemma 1 in [4] and sticky face lemma 11. Note that unlike Proposition 4, here we do not assume rational polyhedral recession cone.
Lemma 12. Let K be a Motzkin-decomposable set with polyhedral recession cone, and F is a -face of K. For any  > 0, let F := {x  K |  x  F s.t. x - x  }. Then there exists  > 0, such that for any  with  -  < , K () = F ().
Proof. By assumption, since K is Motzkin-decomposable with polyhedral recession cone, then we write K = C + cone(R) for a compact convex set C and a finite set of extreme rays R. Let F = {x  K | x = 0} be the -face of K and x = 0 is a supporting hyperplane (0 < ), we know that r  0 for any r  R, and R0 := {r  R | r = 0} is the set of extreme rays of F . Clearly R0 is also the set of extreme rays of F.
We prove the statement of this lemma by contradiction: there exists a convergent sequence i   and K(i) > F (i). Note that here F (i) < , which implies ir  0 for any r  R0.
10

By definition of R0, we know that for any r  R \ R0, there is r < 0. Here R \ R0 is a finite set, hence for any i close enough to , we also have ir < 0 for any r  R \ R0. Therefore, for any i close enough to , there is ir  0 for any r  R. W.l.o.g., we can assume that for our sequence {i}i1, ir  0 for any r  R and i  1. From K (i) > F (i) for any i  1, we know there must exist xi  K \ F, such that ixi > F (i) = maxxFC ix. From our above assumption that ir  0 for any r  R, here we can further assume that xi  C \ F. Since xi  C which is a compact set, by Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, there is a convergent subsequence of {xi}i1. W.l.o.g. we still assume the convergent subsequence of {xi}i1 is itself, and xi  x  C. Note that xi / F, so we have x / F . Therefore, from ixi > maxxFC ix, we have:

x

Since x = 0 is a supporting hyperplane of K, we obtain that x = 0 and x  F , which gives the contradiction.

Next we present the key lemma for establishing the proof of Proposition 4.

Lemma 13. Let K be a Motzkin-decomposable set with rational polyhedral recession cone. For any -face F of K, if F  is finitely-generated, then there exists a rational polyhedron P obtained from finitely many CG cuts of K and  > 0, such that for any  with  -  < , x  K() is
valid to P.

Proof. Let K = C + cone(R), where C is a compact convex set and R is a finite set of rational
extreme rays of K. Denote u := maxxC x < . Here we can find a multiplier  > 0, such that (, 0) := (, K ()) with 0  Z. In the following discussion, we simply denote the supporting hyperplane x = K() of K as x = 0.
By assumption that F  is finitely-generated, we can denote F  = {x  Rn | gx  F (g), g  G}, with g  Zn, g  G. Here w.l.o.g. we assume that 0  G, since 0x  F (0) trivially holds.
Pick a small positive number

and choose a neighborhood of F :

F¯ := {x  K |  x  F s.t.

}.

By Lemma 12, we know there exists a positive number 0 > 0, such that for any  with - < 0,

there is K() = F¯(). Furthermore, there is a large enough integer number N0, such that for

any positive integer m  N0 and any vector c with

we

have

for any g  G, which is

By Lemma 10, Zn-Z>N0 contains a dense subset of V, so we can find some ci -mi, i  [0, 1]

for i  [k] with

that

Claim 1. For any x  F¯ and v  V, vx  v u.

11

Proof of claim. Let R0 := {r  R | r = 0} denote the set of extreme rays of the face F . Then obviously R0 is also the set of extreme rays of the set F¯. Since   ker(R0), where ker(R0) is

a rational linear subspace because R is assumed to be a finite set of rational vectors, hence from

Lemma 9, we know V  ker(R0). This implies that, for any v  V and x = y + r  C + R0, there

is vx = vy  v u.



Therefore, for any x  F¯, i  [k] and g  G, we have

(ci + g)x = gx + mix + (ci - mi)x

(7)

 F (g) +  + mi0 + .

Here for any x  F¯, gx  F (g) +  is from the definition of F¯, and (ci - mi)x   is from the

last claim and the fact that ci - mi  V and

ci - mi

According

to

our

construction

of

N0

and 0, we know

that K((ci + g)

 ci +g

) = F¯ ((ci + g)

 ci +g

), for any i  [k].

Hence:

K(ci + g) = F¯(ci + g)  F (g) + mi0 + 2.

Here the last inequality is from (7). This implies that

(ci + g)x  F (g) + mi0 + 2 = F (g) + mi0

is a CG cut of K, for any i  [k] and g  G. Here the last equality is because  is assumed to be

less

than

and

Z.

Now

we

denote

P := {x  Rn | (ci + g)x  F (g) + mi0, i  [k], g  G}.

(8)

Here P is a rational polyhedron which is obtained from finitely-many CG cuts of K.
Claim 2. x  0 is valid to P, and {x  P | x = 0}  F .
Proof of claim. For any g  G, by definition of P, we know that inequality ( i[k] ici + g)x  F (g) + i[k] imi0 is valid to P. By (6), such inequality is just ( + g)x  F (g) + 0, where we denote  := i[k] imi. By assumption that 0  G, we know x  0 is valid to P. Moreover, there is

{x  P | x = 0}  {x  Rn | x = 0, ( + g)x  F (g) + 0, g  G}  {x  Rn | gx  F (g), g  G} = F   F.

Hence this claim holds.



Lastly, we want to show that, for  close enough to , x  K () will always be valid to P. Denote F to be the -face of P, and let  := x for any arbitrary x  F. Here F = {x  P | x = }. By the sticky face lemma 11, for polyhedron P, we know there exists 1 > 0, such that when  -  < 1, P () = F (). It suffices for us to show, for  close enough to  there is F ()  K (), because this will imply that P ()  K(), meaning x  K() is also valid to P. Note that Claim 2 tells that x  0 is valid to P, we have   0. Next we argue by two cases:

1. Case  = 0: In this case, F = {x  P | x = 0}. By Claim 2, there is F  F  K, which implies that F ()  K(). Hence in this case, when  is close enough to , P () = F ()  K (), completing the proof.

12

2. Case  < 0: We decompose the face F as: F = conv(E) + cone(R), where E and R denote the set of extreme points and extreme rays of F respectively. Arbitrarily pick r  R, it is also an extreme ray of polyhedron P. By the definition (8) of P, we know (ci + g)r  0 for any i  [k] and g  G. Since r is an extreme ray of face F = {x  P | x = }, we also have r = 0. By (6), we know there must exist some i  [k], such that cir  0. Combined with the fact that (ci + g)r  0 for any g  G, we have: gr  0, g  G. Recall that F  = {x  Rn | gx  F (g), g  G}, hence r is also a ray of F , which is contained in K. This implies that, for any , if F () = , then K() = . Therefore, we only have to show, for any  close enough to  and F () < , then x  K () is valid to P. For any  close enough to  with F () < , there is

F ()

This

for this case.

Therefore, we have shown that, there exists a small constant  > 0, such that for any  with

 -  < , x  K() is always valid to P. Note that  =  and K() = K (), by

picking

,

we

conclude

the

proof.

Now we have all the tools needed to verify Proposition 4.

Proof of Proposition 4. Denote K = C + cone(R), where C is a compact convex set and R is a finite set of rational extreme rays of K. The proof proceeds via induction on the dimension of K. By inductive hypothesis, this proposition holds for proper faces of K. Further from Theorem 1, we know that the CG closure of any proper face of K is finitely-generated. Let

 := {  Rn |  = 1, r  0 r  R}.

Since a closed convex set can be exactly given by intersecting all of its supporting half-spaces, there is K = {x  Rn | x  K (),   }. For any   , since the CG closure of any proper face of K is finitely-generated, by Lemma 13, we know there exists a rational polyhedron P obtained from finitely many CG cuts of K and a positive number , such that for any  with  -  < , x  K () will be valid to P. Hence we obtain an open cover {O ()} for . Because  is a compact set, as a consequence, there exists a finite subset ¯   with
  {O ()}¯ . Consider polyhedron

P := P.

(9)

¯

Here we know that P is also obtained from finitely many CG cuts of K. Moreover, for any supporting half-space x  K() of K, since     {O ()}¯ , we know there exists   ¯ such that   O (). Hence x  K() is valid to P , which contains P . In other words, we have shown that, for any supporting half-space of K, this half-space also contains P .
Therefore, our constructed P in (9) is contained in K, and we complete the proof.

13

4.2 Proof of Theorem 2
To show the necessary condition for the rational polyhedrality of K in Theorem 2, we will need the following easy lemma.
Lemma 14. For a closed convex set K, rec(K) = rec(K).
Proof. Since K  K, it suffices to show: rec(K)  rec(K). Arbitrarily pick r  rec(K), denote Cr := {c  Zn | c · r  0}. For any c  Zn \ Cr, since c · r > 0, we know K(c) = . Therefore, K = cCr {x  Rn | cx  K (c)}. Since c · r  0 for any c  Cr, we obtain r  rec(K). By the arbitrariness of r  rec(K), we conclude the proof of rec(K)  rec(K).

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 2.

Proof of Theorem 2. Let K be a Motzkin-decomposable set. First, assume rec(K) is a rational polyhedral cone. Then by Proposition 4 and Theorem 1, we know that K is finitely-generated. Now assume that K is a finitely-generated. Then K is also a rational polyhedron, which has
rational polyhedral recession cone. By Lemma 14, we obtain that K also has rational polyhedral
recession cone.

When K is further assumed to contain integer points in its interior, we have the following necessary condition for conv(K  Zn) to be a rational polyhedron.
Proposition 5 (Theorem 6 [11]). Let K be a closed convex set in Rn. If int(K)  Zn =  and conv(K  Zn) is a polyhedron, then rec(K) is a rational polyhedral cone.

From the last proposition and Theorem 2, we obtain Corollary 1 as an immediate corollary.

Proof of Corollary 1. Let K be a Motzkin-decomposable set which contains integer points in its interior. First, assume conv(K  Zn) is a polyhedron. Then by Proposition 5, we know that K has rational polyhedral recession cone. From Theorem 2, we obtain that K is a rational polyhedron. Now, assuming K is a rational polyhedron. By the fact that K  Zn = K  Zn, we know conv(K  Zn) = conv(K  Zn), which is a rational polyhedron.

For closed convex sets which are not Motzkin-decomposable, as we have seen from Example 1

and Example 2, the integer hull of K1 and K2 are both polyhedral, while K1 is non-polyhedral, and K2 is polyhedral. The fact that K1 is congruent with K2 suggests that for more general closed convex set, the relationship between its integer hull and its CG closure is more subtle. Moreover,

we should further remark that, the additional condition that int(K)  Zn =  is not artificial.

Then K  Z2 = {0}, and its integer hull is a singleton (also a polyhedron). However, K = K which

A Proof of Proposition 1 and Corollaries
We will require the next extended Farkas' lemma for the proof of Proposition 1.
Lemma 15 (Extended Farkas' lemma, Corollary 3.1.2 [16]). The inequality ax  b is a consequence of the consistent system {atx  bt, t  T } if and only if (a, b)  cl cone({(at, bt) t  T, (0, . . . , 0, -1)}).
Proof of Proposition 1. Consider the linear system { · (x, -1)   }. Since I () is essentially the feasible region given by this linear system which is also non-empty, we know that linear system { · (x, -1)   } is consistent. By extended Farkas' lemma 15 and the assumption that (0, . . . , 0, 1)  , we obtain x   is valid to I () if and only if (, )  cl cone(). Proof of Corollary 2. By definition, I () is finitely-generated if there exists a finite subset ¯   with I (¯ ) = I (). It suffices to show: for any finite subset ¯  , I (¯ ) = I () if and only if cone(¯ ) = cl cone(). Note that I (¯ ) = I () is equivalent of saying: any inequality x   is valid to I (¯ ) if and only if it is also valid to I (). By Proposition 1, that is further equivalent of saying: (, )  cone(¯ ) if and only if (, )  cl cone(). Thus we complete the proof.
B Proof of Lemma 5
First, we present some well-known results in convex geometry that will be needed. Lemma 16 (Supporting Hyperplane Theorem for pointed cone). Let K  Rn be a closed convex pointed cone. Then there is h  Rn such that if x  K and x = 0, then hT x > 0. Proof. Since K is pointed, we know the polar cone K is full-dimensional. So we can find an interior point x  K, which has x · x < 0 for all x  K. By picking h = -x we complete the proof. Lemma 17 (Lemma 2.4 in [19], Theorem 3.5 [21]). Let S be a non-empty closed set in Rn. Then, every extreme point of cl conv(S) belongs to S.

From the definition of , we also have hai = 1, ai  cl cone(). According to the extreme ray

assumption of r, while it can be written as the conical combination (convex combination is also

conical combination) of other points in cl cone(), we know there exists i > 0 such that ai = ir. Since hr = hai = 1, we have i = 1, meaning ai = r, which contradict to the assumption that r = ai. So for any extreme ray r  cl cone() with hr = 1, r is an extreme point of cl conv().

Since cl conv() = cl conv(cl()), so r is an extreme point of cl conv(cl()). By Lemma 17, we

C Proof of Lemma 10
The next lemma says, the rational linear subspace V defined in Definition 2 can be characterized by any linear basis of {1, 1, . . . , n} over Q. Let e1, . . . , en denote the canonical basis of Zn. Lemma 18. Let {1, i for i  I} be a linear basis of {1, 1, . . . , n} over Q, with j = qj,0 +
iI qj,ii j / I, here qj,i  Q i  {0}  I, j / I. Then V = {x  Rn | xj = iI qj,ixi j / I}. Proof. Denote L := {x  Rn | xj = iI qj,ixi, j / I}. First, we show that V  L. For any   Qn such that T   Q, since j = qj,0 + iI qj,ii for any j / I, we have: T  = iI ii +
j/I j (qj,0 + iI qj,ii) = j/I jqj,0 + iI (i + j/I jqj,i)i  Q. Since   Qn, qj,i  Q, and {1, i for i  I} are linearly independent over Q, hence we obtain that i + j/I jqj,i = 0 for any i  I. For any x  L, by definition of L, we have T x = iI (i + j/I jqj,i)xi, which is simply 0. Therefore, we have shown V  L. Next, we show L  V. For any j / I, define

17

j := ej - iI qj,iei. Then easy to verify that, (j)T   Q. So for any x  V and j / I, there is (j)T x = 0. This is simply saying, for any j / I, xj = iI qj,ixi, which implies that L  V.

Proof of Lemma 10. W.l.o.g. we assume that a linear basis of {1, 1, . . . , n} over Q is {1, 1, . . . , k}.

By

we

When

and the

statement

of

this lemma is a special case of Weyl's criterion. We reduce the general case to this one.

The following elements lie in {x  Rn | xj =

By Weyl's criterion, Zk + (1, . . . , k)Z>N0 is dense in Rk. We reformulate this for V via the

projection to the first k coordinates, which is an isomorphism between V and Rk: a dense subset

of V is

k i=1

Ze~i

which

is

a

subset

This

the

proof.
