## Abstract

A new model of anisotropic compact star is obtained in our present paper by assuming the pressure anisotropy. The proposed model is singularity free. The model is obtained by considering a physically reasonable choice for the metric potential $g_{rr}$ which depends on a dimensionless parameter `n'. The effect of $n$ is discussed numerically, analytically and through plotting. We have concentrated a wide range for n ($10\leq n \leq 1000$) for drawing the profiles of different physical parameters. The maximum allowable mass for different values of $n$ have been obtained by M-R plot. We have checked that the stability of the model is increased for larger value of $n$. For the viability of the model we have considered two compact stars PSR J1614-2230 and EXO 1785-248. We have shown that the expressions for the anisotropy factor and the metric component may serve as generating functions for uncharged stellar models in the context of the general theory of relativity.
