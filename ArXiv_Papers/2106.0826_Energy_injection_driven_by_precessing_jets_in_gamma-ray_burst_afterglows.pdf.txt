ABSTRACT Jet precession is considered to universally exist in different-scale astronomical phenomena, including gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). For the long-lived GRB central engine, the relativistical precessing jets will periodically inject kinetic energy into the external shocks, then significantly modulate the shapes of the light curves (LCs) in GRB afterglows. In this paper, we adopt the standard external shock model to investigate the effects of jet precession on GRB X-ray afterglows in cases with different parameters, i.e., the steady or time-dependent jet powers, precession periods, precession angles, and viewing angles. In the case where the jet powers are in steady or slow decay and the jet can sweep across the line of sight, shallow decay (or plateau) segments should appear; otherwise, a giant bump will emerge in the GRB afterglow LCs. We show that jet precession is a new plausible mechanism of the energy injection in GRBs. Moreover, some observed X-ray transients without GRB associations might be powered by the precessing jets.

1. INTRODUCTION
The convincing evidence regarding the existence of jet precession is that S-type and Z-type jet shapes have been observed in galaxies (e.g., Miley 1980; Begelman et al. 1984; Lu 1990; Proctor 2011; Lu & Zhou 2005). The wellknown X-ray binary SS 433 has a 162.5-day precession period (e.g., Sarazin et al. 1980; Margon 1984). Recently, the low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations of a black hole (BH) binary MAXI J1820+070 in the X-ray hard state have been discovered by Insight-HXMT, which probably originate from the jet precession (Ma et al. 2021). Moreover, the quasiperiodic variability of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), especially in the BATSE data, is generally thought to be caused by the precession of relativistic jets (e.g., Blackman et al. 1996; Portegies Zwart et al. 1999).
GRBs are the most powerful electromagnetic explosions in the Universe and can be simply classified as either short- or long-duration GRBs (SGRBs and LGRBs, respectively). It is generally believed that SGRBs and LGRBs originate from the mergers of binary compact objects (see review by Nakar 2007) and the collapse of massive stars (see review by Woosley & Bloom 2006), respectively. Regardless, a rapidly rotating BH surrounded by a hyperaccretion disk (for reviews, see Liu et al. 2017a) or a massive millisecond pulsar (e.g., Duncan & Thompson 1992; Usov 1992; Dai & Lu 1998b; Zhang & M´esza´ros 2001) will be born in their centers. Once the directions of the angular momenta of binary compact objects are misaligned in the mergers or the explosions of core-collapse supernovae are anisotropic, the central compact object systems will be led to precess and launch precessing jets (e.g., Liu et al. 2017b). However, the precession angles are typically shallow in these scenarios.
In addition to the quasiperiodic signals in the GRB that prompt emission and the following afterglow phases, which can be explained by the jet precession, some peculiar features of light curves (LCs) are preferred in the interpretation of jet precession (e.g., Reynoso et al. 2006; Lei et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2010; Stone et al. 2013). Liu et al. (2010) proposed jet precession driven by a neutrino-cooled accretion disk (e.g., Popham et al. 1999; Liu et al. 2007) around a spinning BH. The outer disk forces the BH and the inner region to precess. We modeled both the symmetric and fast-riseexponential-decay pulses and their spectral evolutions as well as the observed gamma-ray LCs. The gravitational waves from the precession of the BH hyperaccretion systems in GRBs have also been studied (e.g., Romero et al.

2010; Sun et al. 2012; Kotake et al. 2012). Fargion & Grossi (2006) used a persistent, thin precessing and spinning jet within the precessing timescale, which lasts a few hours, to explain the multi-rebrightening phenomena that emerge in the afterglow phases. Hou et al. (2014a) explained the origin and time evolution of the flares in an ultra-LGRB (ULGRB), GRB 130925A, by the precessing Blandford-Znajek jets (Blandford & Znajek 1977) launched by a longlived BH hyperaccretion disk (more than 10 ks, see, e.g., Liu et al. 2018) in the center of a massive collapsar. The same model was also used to account for the periodic signals  86 s in the X-ray bump of another ULGRB, GRB 121027A (Hou et al. 2014b). Furthermore, Huang et al. (2019) studied jets with a precession timescale of  1 s in the afterglow phase and described the afterglow emission for the structured jets.
The shallow decay (or plateau) segments are generally observed in GRBs by the Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT, see, e.g., Zhang et al. 2006; Troja et al. 2007; Rowlinson et al. 2010). According to the following power-law decay with the indices < -3 and > -3, this decay can be divided into "internal" and "ordinary" classes, respectively (e.g., Du 2020). Its timescales extend to approximately several hundred and several thousand seconds in SGRBs and LGRBs, respectively (e.g., Zhang 2007). The X-ray luminosity is in the range from  1046 to 1048 erg s-1 (e.g., Zhao et al. 2019). The origin of the shallow decay segment is still a mystery, and many models have been proposed in the literature, such as continuous energy injection of the spin-down luminosity of a magnetar (e.g., Zhang & M´esza´ros 2001; Fan et al. 2013; Du 2020) or supramassive fast-rotating quark stars (e.g., Li et al. 2016; Hou et al. 2018; Ouyed et al. 2020), a jet with evolutive microphysical factors (e.g., Ioka et al. 2006; Panaitescu et al. 2006) or with a bulk Lorentz factor distribution (e.g., Uhm & Beloborodov 2007), a two-component ejecta (e.g., Toma et al. 2006; Yamazaki 2009), a delayed deceleration jet (e.g., Duffell & MacFadyen 2015), and a jet with a slightly off-axis view (e.g., Beniamini et al. 2020). Since the rapid decay after the internal plateaus implies an origin related to a neutron star (NS) collapsing into a BH, here, we investigate only the possible origin of the ordinary plateaus in GRB afterglows.
For a precessing jet with a shallow precession angle launched by the long-lived GRB central engine, its effects should be significantly revealed in the afterglow LCs rather than in prompt emission. In this paper, we study this energy injection mechanism to revisit the origin of the shallow decays (or plateaus) or other characteristic LCs in GRB afterglows. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the model of the GRB precessing jets and their radiation mechanism in the external shocks. The main results are given in Section 3, and conclusions and discussion are made in Section 4.
2. MODEL

Jet precession in GRB afterglows

2.1. Dynamics

To calculate the afterglow LCs of GRBs powered by a long-lived precessing jet, an approximate treatment for the precession process is adopted here. The spiral path of a precessing jet, represented by the blue curve in Figure 1, can be roughly considered to be ceaselessly filled by discrete sub-jets. The number of these discrete sub-jets is related to the jet half-opening angle jet and the precession angle pre, and one should ensure that the overlaps among the discrete sub-jets are as small as possible and that the sub-jets in each period are sufficient to cover the path.
In the first precession period, due to the interaction between the sub-jets and the circumburst medium, the relativistic external forward shocks (EFSs) are generated and propagate through the medium. Because the age of the jet is much larger than the precession period, the subsequent sub-jets in each period carry out the energy injection, potentially catching up with the EFSs produced in the first period and colliding with them. The dynamics of the EFSs can be described by solving differential equations listed as follows1 (Zhang 2018),

where  , U , m, and R represent the bulk Lorentz factor, the internal energy, the sweep-up mass from the circumburst

medium, and the distance from the central source, respectively. Einj, M0, , n, and t are the injection energy, the initial mass, the radiation efficiency of electrons in the EFSs, the number density of the circumburst medium, and

the time measured in the observer frame, respectively. Likewise, ^ is the adiabatic index which is obtained by the formula, ^  (5 - 1.21937 + 0.182032 - 0.965833 + 2.325134 - 2.393325 + 1.071366)/3, with   /(0.24 + ),   ( + 1.07()2)/3(1 +  + 1.07()2), and  = 1 - 1/2 (e.g., Pe'er 2012). In addition, the function form

of dEinj/dt can be simply described as

dEinj dt

=

2Pjet/(1 - cos jet), Tstart < t < Tend,

0,

others,

(5)

where Tstart = ((i - 1)t + j ), Tend = (it + j ), i (= 1, 2, . . . , k) represents the serial number of sub-jets within each period, j (= 1, 2, . . . , tend/ - 1) denotes the serial number of the precession period,  is the precession period, and t =  /k. In this work, the value of the mass density of the medium is considered to be a constant (i.e., interstellar

medium), and the evolution of jet is neglected because the sideways expansion is not important, as shown by numerical

simulations (e.g., Zhang & MacFadyen 2009; Chen & Zhang 2021).

Two cases of the jet power Pjet are considered. A steady power is discussed in Case I, i.e., Pjet = Pj0et. In Case II, a

power law form

Pjet(t) = Pj0et(t/t0)-

(6)

and a smooth broken power law form

Pjet(t) = Pj0et[(t/t0)rs + (t/tb)ds]-1/s

(7)

are taken into account, where , r, and d are all temporal slopes, tb is the break time, s measures the sharpness of the break, t0  R0(1 + z)/(220c) is the starting time of the afterglows, with an initial radius R0 = 1014 cm, an initial Lorentz factor 0 = 200, and the redshift of the burst z, and Pj0et is the jet power at t0. Furthermore, in

1 The dynamical descriptions of Zhang (2018) adopt a proper treatment of the adiabatic loss term, which is not included in Pe'er (2012) and Huang et al. (1999). In addition, the effect of the pressure is considered here, which is simplified by the assumption of the continuous inelastic collisions between the blast waves and the interstellar medium in Huang et al. (1999). We found that the results by using the dynamics in Pe'er (2012) and Zhang (2018) keep basically consistent, and the results by using the dynamics in Huang et al. (1999) have about 1.5 times higher at the peak flux.

It should be noted that the afterglow starts from t0; thus, the energy released before t0

needs to be deducted in the first EFS process.

2.2. Electron Distribution

Following the evolution of the dynamics mentioned above, the evolution of the shock-accelerated electrons can be expressed as a function of the radius R, i.e.,

 R

dNe de

= Q^ISM,

(8)

where dNe/de is the instantaneous electron energy spectrum, e is the Lorentz factor of the shock-accelerated electrons,

e is the cooling rate of electrons with the Lorentz 1)R2nep,m-i1n, is adopted to describe the injection

factor e , dt/dR = 1/c, and Q^ISM = K¯ e-p, with K¯  4(p - behavior of newly shocked circumburst medium electrons (e.g.,

Fan et al. 2008; Huang et al. 2020), where p (> 2) is the power law index and e,min  e  e,max is adopted for e . It

is note that quantities with a superscript accent sign are defined in the comoving frame of the EFSs. Since the shocked

electrons and the magnetic fields share the fractions e and B of the thermal energy density in the EFS downstream, the

minimum Lorentz factor of the shock-accelerated electrons can be expressed as e,min = e( - 1)(p - 2)mp/(p - 1)me, with mp and me being the proton and electron masses, respectively, and the maximum Lorentz factor of electrons is
e,max = 9m2ec4/8Be3, with B = 32( - 1)nmpBc2 being the magnetic field behind the EFSs and c being the speed of light (e.g., Kumar et al. 2012; Huang et al. 2020).

2.3. Synchrotron Radiation
In order to calculate the observed flux of the synchrotron radiation from the sub-jets, each sub-jet is divided linearly into 300 × 1000 small emitters along - and  -directions in the comoving spherical coordinate frame correlated to the comoving cartesian coordinate system (x , y, z), and wherein the sub-jet axis is aligned with z-axis as shown in Figure 1. Due to the line-of-sight effect, the arrival time of photons from emitters with the radius R deviated from the line of sight is delayed, compared to that in the line of sight. Since the delays, tde = R(1 - cos em)/c, only depend on the cosine value of the angle between the off-sight emitters and the line of sight, which is depicted as

cos em = sin obs cos obs sin  cos  + sin obs sin obs sin  sin  + cos obs cos ,

(9)

where (obs, obs), and (, ) represent the coordinates of the observer and emitter in the observer frame, respectively. In this work, we set obs = 0 and the transition of the emitter coordinate from the comoving frame to the observer frame can be accomplished with following relations:

sin  cos  = sin pre cos pre cos  + cos pre cos pre sin  cos  - sin pre sin  sin  ,

(10)

sin  sin  = sin pre sin pre cos  + cos pre sin pre sin  cos  + cos pre sin  sin  ,

(11)

cos  = cos pre cos  - sin pre sin  cos  ,

(12)

where (pre, pre) is the coordinate of sub-jet axis in the observer frame. Thereby the observed time of an emitter at radius R is (t + tde)(1 + z). In addition, the synchrotron radiation power at the frequency  can be calculated by the following formula (Rybicki & Lightman 1979):

Psyn (  )

with

function

of order 5/3. Hence, one can calculate the observed flux by summing the flux received from the emitters at the same

observer time in a sub-jet, and the observed flux density can be derived as (e.g., Granot et al. 1999)

where "EATS" is the equal-arrival time surface corresponding to the same observer time in a sub-jet,  = (1+z)obs/D with D = 1/(1- cos em) being the Doppler factor of the emitters, and DL is the luminosity distance in the standard CDM cosmology model (M = 0.27,  = 0.73, and H0 = 71 km s-1 Mpc-1). Further, the total observed flux becomes the accumulation of the observed flux produced on each sub-jet at the same observed time.
3. RESULTS
We calculate the X-ray afterglow LCs with the observed energy in the 10 keV band by following the above model. The typical parameter values of the EFS are set, including e = 10-1, B = 10-5, n = 1 cm-3, p = 2.3, and jet = 5. Stone et al. (2013) obtained the expected value of the precession angle,  10, under the merger of a BH and an NS; thus, we set the precession angles pre = 5 and 10 here. Moreover, different values of the initial jet power Pj0et = 1049 and 1050 erg s-1 and the precession period  = 10 and 100 s are considered. The age of the jet, i.e., tend, is set as 2 ks, which depends on the activity of the GRB central engine and corresponds to the typical timescale of the shallow decays (or plateaus) in LGRBs. The typical redshift z is set as 1.
3.1. Case I
Figure 2 shows the GRB afterglow LCs of Case I in the 10 keV band since triggering of the GRB for the precession periods  = 10 and 100 s, the precession angles pre = 5 and 10, and the initial jet powers Pjet = 1049 and 1050 erg s-1. The black, red, green, blue, and magenta lines in every panel denote the results for obs = 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20, respectively. In this case, one can find that the shallow decay or plateau segments (hereafter called plateaus) appear in some LCs. Some of the plateaus have tiny positive slopes.
The plateaus under the condition of a short precession period in the panels in the left column appear earlier than those in the right column, and the values of the fluxes with Pjet = 1049 erg s-1 are definitely an order of magnitude lower than those with Pjet = 1050 erg s-1. More importantly, when the values of the precession angles are near those of the observer angles (i.e., the jets sweep across the line of sight), the flux is higher. By contrast, the flux is lower and no plateau structure (only a bump shape) emerges when the difference between these two angles is larger, exceeding the range of the jet opening angle. Moreover, the oscillations appearing in the early stage of the plateaus might be to great extent caused by the discrete approximations of the jet precession.
3.2. Case II
Figure 3 shows the LCs of GRB afterglows under the power law evolution of the jet power shown in Equation (6), with  = 10 s, tend = 2 ks, and Pj0et = 1050 erg s-1. Panels (a), (b), and (c) are the results with pre = 5 for temporal slopes  of 1, 0.5, and 0.1, respectively, and panels (e), (f), and (g) are the same as panels (a), (b), and (c), respectively, except pre = 10. The black, red, and green lines in panel (d) are the same as those of the LCs with obs = 5 in panels (a), (b), and (c), and the lines in panel (h) are the same as those of the LCs with obs = 5 in panels (e), (f), and (g), respectively. In this case, one can find that regardless whether pre = 5 or 10, once the values of  are small enough, e.g., panels (c) and (g), the plateaus very clearly emerge. The slope of the plateau decreases quickly with increasing  until the giant bump replaces the plateau when  = 1, as shown in panels (a) and (e). In addition, comparing panel (d) with (h), one can see that although the precessing angle is changed from 5 to 10, a similar plateau still exists in the LCs under the same viewing angle obs = 5, which implies that the evolution of the precessing angle does not significantly affect the plateau structure of the LCs unless the angle between the line of sight and the axis of the first sub-jet is greater than the opening angle of the sub-jets. Figure 4 is the same as Figure 3, except  = 100 s. Despite the difference in the precessing periods, one can see that the results implicated in Figure 4 are similar to those in Figure 3.
Figure 5 shows the LCs of GRB afterglows with  = 10 s, tend = 2 ks, and pre = 10 under a smooth broken power law evolution of the jet power, as shown in Equation (7), with Pj0et = 1050 erg s-1, where the parameter values of the smooth broken power law function are r = -1/2, d = 5/3, s = 1, and tb = 1 ks. The black, red, green, blue, and magenta lines denote the results for obs = 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20, respectively. One can see that a plateau appears in the LC when the viewing angle 5  obs  15, but due to the quick decrease in the broken power-law jet power after 1 ks, the duration of this plateau is shorter than those in the cases with the steady or slow decay ( < 0.5) jet powers.
From the above figures, we note that the precession period does not impact the LC shape; instead, the appearance of the plateaus nearly depends on the time evolution of the jet powers and the relations among the viewing angles, the jet half-opening angles, and the precession angles.

Figure 5. GRB afterglow LCs of Case II with  = 10 s, tend = 2 ks, pre = 10, and Pj0et = 1050 erg s-1 under the smooth broken power law evolution of jet power with r = -1/2, d = 5/3, s = 1, and tb = 1 ks.

No matter which cases of the jet precession substantially increase the size of jet head caused by the continuous sub-jets along the spiral route to power the observable energy injections in GRB afterglows even the structured jets considered. Furthermore, the jet precession model also can apply perfectly to understand the spectral evolution of the afterglow LCs.

4. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION
Regardless whether originating from massive collapsars or compact object mergers, jet precession might be universal in GRBs. The signature of jet precession could be imprinted in GRB observations.
In this work, we focus on GRB X-ray afterglows in the context of long-lived precessing jets. From the results, we find that a plateau or a giant bump can appear in the X-ray afterglow LCs due to the periodic energy of the jets injected into the EFSs and that the shapes of the LCs are related to the time-dependent jet power regardless whether the difference between the viewing angle and the precession angle is within the range of the jet opening angle. These results indicate that long-lived jet precession provides a new mechanism of energy injection in GRB afterglows.
In addition to the X-ray afterglow LCs, the optical or radio afterglow LCs (e.g., van Paradijs et al. 2000; Roming et al. 2006; Liang et al. 2013; Yi et al. 2020) should be modulated and the flux should be significantly enhanced when a larger solid angle of the sky is covered as a result of jet precession. Moreover, once a certain quasiperiodic behavior and a plateau emerge in a GRB, the information of the jet precession might be constrained.
Zhang & M´esza´ros (2001) studied the effect of a continuously injected energy from a highly magnetized millisecond pulsar on GRB afterglows, and then predicted that a distinctive achromatic bump feature with the onset and duration ranging from minutes to months is presented in the afterglow LCs. In their model, the engine emits both an initial impulsive energy input Eimp as well as a continuous luminosity L and the total energy of the external shock is the sum of these two parts. So, which of these two is dominant at a particular observation time T depends on the values of L and Eimp, i.e., T  Eimp/L (Dai & Lu 1998a,b). In this work, we just investigate the energy injection driven by precessing jets and ignore the effects of the blast wave driven by the initial fireball that powered the prompt emission. The timescales of the plateaus in Cases I and II are about several to 10 ks, which could be longer than the typical T , the plateaus might be observable at least in the later stage. For instance, given Pjet  1049 erg s-1 and Eimp  1053 erg,

if the value of the flux can meet about 10-11 erg cm-2 s-1 as shown in Figure 2, the isotropic "effective" injection luminosity Leff achieves about 1050 erg s-1 in the precession model, thus T  Eimp/Leff  1 ks. Leff has almost the same value with the isotropic injection luminosity of a line-of-sight jet without precession (e.g., Fan & Piran 2006; Zhong et al. 2016), and it is only a fraction of the isotropic injected power, 2Pjet/(1 - cos jet)  1051 erg s-1. This fraction can also be roughly estimated by the proportion of the timescale of the observable sub-jets in a whole period.
In the case of BH hyperaccretion, the angular momenta between the BH and the disk will be redistributed, and massive collapsars will undergo an initially drastic accretion process lasting tens of seconds (e.g., Liu et al. 2018), which is much longer and more severe than in mergers (e.g., Song et al. 2018). Then, following the rapid decay of the accretion rate, the redistribution will tend to ease; hence, the precession period and angle might be in the quasi-steady state during the GRB afterglow phase. Thus, it might exist that the transients with X-ray plateaus but no associated GRBs if the initial jets cannot break out from the envelope and circumstances or out of the line of sight.
Xue et al. (2019) discovered a peculiar X-ray transient, CDF-S XT2, at z = 0.738 in Chandra deep-field south survey. Its best-fit power-law slopes are -0.14+-00..0033 before the break at 2.3-+00..43 ks and -2.16+-00..2269 after the break in 0.5 - 7 keV band. They proposed that it might be powered by a millisecond magnetar after a binary NS merger (also see, e.g., Sun et al. 2019; Xiao et al. 2019; Ren et al. 2020). This X-ray transient is presented from GRBs viewed far off-axis to the line of sight (e.g., Dado & Dar 2019; Sun et al. 2019). Moreover, another transient in the survey, CDF-S XT1, has a power-law decay with a slope -1.53 ± 0.27 (Bauer et al. 2017). The LCs of these two sources are similar to our results. If we reasonably set the power-law index of the electrons p  4 (e.g., Sironi & Spitkovsky 2014; Guo et al. 2015; Xiao et al. 2019), it is easy to build up the LC of CDF-S XT2. Meanwhile, other parameters of the jet precession model are still in large value spaces. Thus we consider that these X-ray transients are possible origin from the precessing jets launched by the BH hyperaccretion or magnetars in the scenarios of the massive collapsars or compact object mergers.
