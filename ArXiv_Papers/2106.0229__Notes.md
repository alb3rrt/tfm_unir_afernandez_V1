## Abstract

A refinement of the classic equivalence relation among Cauchy sequences yields a useful infinitesimal-enriched number system. Such an approach can be seen as formalizing Cauchy's sentiment that a null sequence "becomes" an infinitesimal. We signal a little-noticed construction of a system with infinitesimals in a 1910 publication by Giuseppe Peano, reversing his earlier endorsement of Cantor's belittling of infinitesimals.
