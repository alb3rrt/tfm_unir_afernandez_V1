The paradox of the infinity
MOHAMED AYAD and OMAR KIHEL
1 Introduction
Let (P) be a property defined on the set of the natural numbers and An be the set of positive integers less or equal n, where n is a positive integer. If an integer is selected at random from An, then the probability n that it satisfies (P) is the number of elements in An that satisfy (P) divided by n. If the limit of n when n tends to infinity exists, this limit is called the natural density or asymptotic density of the integers satisfying (P). Intuitively, this density measures how frequently an integer satisfies (P). One can define analogously the natural density on any infinite subset of the set of natural numbers. Let's consider the following situation:
Let E be an infinite set on which a property (P) is defined. Suppose that E = iIEi is a partition, where each Ei is infinite. Suppose also that, in each Ei, the number of elements satisfying (P) is finite. Then, clearly the density of the elements satisfying (P) is 0 in every Ei. Is it possible that the density of the subset of E containing all the elements satisfying (P) will be at least equal to 1/2?
We were first confronted with this situation while reading the paper of Arno et al. [1]. In fact, it is in the paper [1] where it is shown that the density of certain algebraic numbers in Q, which we will call Arno et al. numbers in section 5, is equal to 1/(3). We have partitioned Q in a way that suggests these Arno et al. numbers are rare. This phenomenom struck us as contradictory, which lead us to consider the situation in greater detail. We will show in the sequel, through two examples, that the answer to the above question may be positive. At first glance, this problem resembles to the so called Simpson paradox in probability and statistics. In this paper, when we say the density, we mean the natural density.

2 First example

Let E = N \ {0, 1}. In this set the relation (P) will be : x is even. For any

i  1, let

Ei = {2i}  {2ik + 1, k  1 odd}

The Ei constitute a partition of E; each class contains a unique element satisfying (P). On the other hand, the density in E of the elements satisfying

(P) is equal to 1/2.

Before producing the second example, we need to state, in the following section, some results on the denominator and constant coefficient of an algebraic number. The reader who is familiar with these notions may skip this section.

3 Denominator of an algebraic number

Let  be an algebraic number of degree n,

g(x) = cnxn + cn-1xn-1 + . . . + c1x + c0
be the unique irreducible polynomial with integral coefficients such that g() = 0 and cn > 0. This polynomial will be called the minimal polynomial of  over Z. Let

I = I() = {k  Z, k an algebraic integer}

(1)

Then I() is a principal ideal of Z. Since cn is an algebraic integer, then cn  I(). Hence I() = (0). Let d > 0 be a generator of I(), then d is the smallest positive integer such that d is integral. Moreover d | cn. Call this integer d the denominator of . Let  = d, then  is an algebraic integer,
called the numerator of . The leading coefficient cn of g(x) will be called the leading coefficient of . Denote by d() and c() the denominator and
the leading coefficient of  respectively.

be the elementary symmetric function of degree i of the j. Let

J = J() = {k  Z, ksi()  Z for i = 1, . . . , n},

(2)

then J is a principal ideal of Z generated by c(). Moreover c() | dn.

Proof. Let c be a generator of J() and let d = d(). Set  = /d where  is an algebraic integer. Since
dnsk() = dn i1    ik = dn (i1/d)    (ik /d)
then dn  J() thus c | dn. Let c = c() and let g(x) be the minimal polynomial of  over Z, then
g(x) = c(x - 1)    (x - n) = c xn - s1()xn-1 + . . . + (-1)nsn() = cxn - cs1()xn-1 + . . . + (-1)ncsn().
Since g(x)  Z[x] then csk()  Z for k = 1, . . . , n, hence c  J(), which implies c | c. On the other hand let
g1(x) = c(x - 1)    (x - n) = cxn - cs1()xn-1 + . . . + (-1)ncsn()  Z[x].
Since g1() = 0, then g(x) divides g1(x) in Q[x]. Set g1(x) = g(x)q with q  Q. Using the content of polynomials, denoted by cont, We have cont(g1) = qcont(g) = q, hence q  Z. The comparison of the leading coefficients leads to c = cq, hence c | c. Finally we get c = c.
Remark 2 We have shown that d() | c() and c() | d()n, hence d() and c() have the same prime factors.
Example 3 In the following example we compare the denominator and the leading coefficient. In particular we look for the condition d() = c().
Let  = 2/(q2k) with q positive and odd and k  0. Here d() = q2k.  is a root of the equation 22kq22 - 2 = 0 which is not always irreducible over Z. In the different cases which follow we precise the minimal polynomial g(x) of  over Z.
 k = 0, g(x) = q2x2 - 2, hence d() = q and c() = q2 > d() except if q = 1, i.e.  = 2.
 k = 1 and q = 1. Here g(x) = 2x2 - 1, d() = c() = 2.  k = 1 and q  2. Here g(x) = 2q2x2 - 1, hence d() = 2q and c() = 2q2 > d().
3

 k  2 and q  1. Here g(x) = 22k-1q2x2 - 1, hence d() = 2kq and

c() = 22k-1q2 > d().





We thus get c() = d() if and only if  = 2 or  = 2/2. This

example suggests that we almost always have c() > d().

4 Result of Arno-Robinson-Wheeler
These three authors have shown that the density in Q of the algebraic numbers  such that c() = d() is equal to 1/(3) = 0.8319.... These numbers will be called Arno et al. numbers. The height of a polynomial with integral coefficients, P (x) = akxk + . . . + a0, is defined by H(P ) = maxi |ai|. The height of an algebraic number is the height of its minimal polynomial over Z. To prove their result, Arno et al. define the sets
Ad(H) = {  Q, deg() = d, and H()  H} and
A^d(H) = {  Ad(H)}, c() = d()},
where H is a positive integer and H() denotes the height of . After obtaining an asymptotic formula of |A^d(H)|/|Ad(H)|, they deduce that
lim lim | kd A^k(H)|/| kd Ak(H)| = 1/(3).
d H
This result makes appear that the Arno et al. numbers are very frequent in the set of the algebraic numbers. In the sequel we define a partition of Q which suggests that the Arno et al. numbers are rare. With the characterizations of d() and c() given above this result of Arno et al. seems surprising. Actually d() is the smallest positive integer d such that d is an algebraic integer. In contrast, c() is the smallest positive integer c such that all the products
c(1 + . . . + n), c(12 + . . . + n-1n), . . . , c1    n
are rational integers. For the first product, we clearly see that c may be replaced by d, but for the others? Arno's et al. result tells us that it is also true with a high probability.

5 Second example

Definition 4 Let K be a number field of degree n over Q,  be an algebraic integer of K, and f (x) = xn + an-1xn-1 + . . . + a1x + a0 the characteristic
polynomial of  over Q. The norm of  over Q, denoted by NQ()/Q(), is defined by NQ()/Q() = (-1)na0.

Proposition 5 Let  = /d be an algebraic number of degree n  2, where
 is an algebraic integer and d = d(). Suppose that  is an Arno et al. number, then dn-1 | NQ()/Q().

Proof. Let

f (x) = xn + an-1xn-1 + . . . + a1x + a0

be the minimal polynomial of  over Q. Since f (d) = 0, we have

dn + an-1n-1 +    + (a1/dn-2) + (a0/dn-1) = 0.

The minimal polynomial of  over Z has the form

g(x) = dxn + cn-1xn-1 + . . . + c1x + c0.

It follows that g(x) divides the polynomial

dxn + an-1xn-1 +    + (a1/dn-2)x + (a0/dn-1).

in Q[x]. Let q  Q such that

dxn + an-1xn-1 +    + (a1/dn-2)x + (a0/dn-1) = qg(x).

Identifying the leading coefficients, we get q = 1 and since c0 is an integer, then dn-1 | a0.
Make a partition of Q \ Q by putting in the same class, say C(), all the algebraic numbers whose numerator is equal to the algebraic integer . The preceding proposition shows that any class C() contains a finite number (may be 0) of Arno et al. numbers. We thus have a second example of a set, namely Q \ Q, and the property (P) states:  is an Arno et al. number.
We have excluded from Q the rational numbers because they are Arno et al. numbers and any corresponding class C() is infinite.
One may think that the Arno et al. numbers are mostly frequent when their degrees are large enough. But, let  = /d be an Arno et al. algebraic number of degree n. Let q be a positive integer divisible by some prime number p such that p | NQ()/Q(), then by the preceding proposition the number q = /q has the same degree as  and generates the same field, but it is not an Arno et al. number. Obviously the number of q's is infinite.

6 Denominator and leading coefficient in the formal case

Proposition 6 Let t0, t1, . . . , tn, x be algebraically independent variables over Z and let
G(x) = tnxn + . . . + t1x + t0  Z[t0, t1, . . . , tn][x].
Set t = (t0, t1, . . . , tn). Let  be a root of G(x) in an algebraic closure of Q(t). Let
I = {D(t)  Z[t], D is integral over Z[t]},
then I is a principal ideal of Z[t] generated by tn.

Proof. Obviously tn  I. Let D(t)  I, then since

tnn + tn-1n-1 + . . . + t1 + t0 = 0,

we have

D(t)

t1D(t)n-1 tn

D(t)

t0D(t) tn

=

0,

hence tn | D(t) thus I = tnZ[t]. This proposition shows that if  is a root of the generic polynomial,
then its denominator and leading coefficient are equal. Since the minimal polynomial over Z of any algebraic number may be obtained by specializing the coefficients of the generic polynomial, it is tempting to conclude that this confirms the result of Arno et al.
Question: Is it possible to find an uncountable set E and a property (P) satisfying the conditions stated in the introduction? Our feeling is that the answer is negative.
