## Abstract

Rheotaxis is a well-known behavior of micro-organisms such as E.Coli and sperm cells and artificial active colloids, wherein the swimmers move anisotropically in response to the imposed fluid flow. Here, we report, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, on the upstream Rheotaxis behavior of the self-propelled micrometer-sized 4-Cyano-4-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) droplets in an aqueous solution of tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) as the surfactant, in an optical cell under externally imposed flow. The behavior is absent in the density matched system indicating that presence of a nearby wall generating a flow-gradient at the droplet level is at the root of this behvaior. Our experiments with optical cells of different vertical heights further highlight that the behavior is observed for a given range of shear rate only and does not depend on the bulk flow-rate. We hypothesize, that the imposed shear flow disturbs the otherwise isotropic distribution of the solutes (filled/empty micelles) allowing the droplets to go against the flow. We also observe that the nematic nature of the droplets also affects the motion during the rheotactic flight. By taking the advantage of this phenomenon, we demonstrate a unique capability of the droplet to be hydrodynamically trapped locally in an external shear flow, which can be useful towards new applications.
