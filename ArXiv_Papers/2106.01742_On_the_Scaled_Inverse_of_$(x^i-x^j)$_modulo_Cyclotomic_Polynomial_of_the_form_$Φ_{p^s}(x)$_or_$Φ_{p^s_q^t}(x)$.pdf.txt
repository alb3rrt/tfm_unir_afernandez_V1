Abstract. The scaled inverse of a nonzero element a(x)  Z[x]/f (x), where f (x) is an irreducible polynomial over Z, is the element b(x)  Z[x]/f (x) such that a(x)b(x) = c (mod f (x)) for the smallest possible
positive integer scale c. In this paper, we investigate the scaled inverse of (xi - xj) modulo cyclotomic polynomial of the form ps (x) or psqt (x), where p, q are primes with p < q and s, t are positive integers. Our main results are that the coefficient size of the scaled inverse of (xi - xj) is bounded by p - 1 with the scale p modulo ps (x), and is bounded by q - 1 with the scale not greater than q modulo psqt (x). Previously, the analogous result on cyclotomic polynomials of the form 2n (x) gave rise to many lattice-based cryptosystems, especially, zero-knowledge proofs. Our result provides more flexible choice of cyclotomic polynomials in
such cryptosystems. Along the way of proving the theorems, we also prove several properties of {xk}kZ in Z[x]/pq(x) which might be of independent interest.

1 Introduction

Cyclotomic polynomials play an important role in algebra, number theory, com-

binatorics, and their applications. In particular, modern lattice-based cryptog-

raphy intensively employs cyclotomic rings Z[x]/M (x) [LPR10,LPR13].

An interesting subclass of cyclotomic polynomials is of the form psqt (x),

where p, q are primes with p < q and s, t are positive integers. Since cyclo-

tomic polynomials of the form ps (x) are just

p-1 i=0

xips-1

,

the

case

with

two

prime factors can be seen as the simplest non-trivial case. There have been var-

ious interesting results on these cyclotomic polynomials [Bei64,HLLP12,Fou13].

For instance, these cyclotomic polynomials have only {-1, 0, 1} as coefficients, whereas a cyclotomic polynomial of a product of three distinct odd primes can have an arbitrarily large coefficient [Leh36].
Benhamouda et. al. [BCK+14] provided the following lemma, which was used to construct more efficient zero-knowledge proofs for lattice-based cryptosystems. The construction is being widely used [BCS19,CKR+20].
Lemma 1 ([BCK+14]). Let M = 2s be a power-of-two. For any i, j  Z satisfying 0  j < i < M , there exists u(x)  Z[x]/M (x) such that
· (xi - xj) · u(x) = 2 (mod M (x)) · and ||u(x)||  1.
Later, Lemma 1 was extended to the case of M being a prime p [CKL21]. In this paper, we generalize these phenomena as the scaled inverses modulo
cyclotomic polynomials (Definition 1). The scaled inverse of a nonzero element a(x)  Z[x]/f (x), where f (x) is an irreducible polynomial over Z, is the element b(x)  Z[x]/f (x) such that a(x)b(x) = c (mod f (x)) for the smallest possible positive integer scale c. We investigate the scaled inverse of (xi - xj ) modulo cyclotomic polynomials of the form ps (x) or psqt (x).
First, we generalize the previous results [BCK+14,CKL21] to ps (x) case: the coefficient size of the scaled inverse of (xi - xj) is bounded by p - 1 with the scale p modulo ps (x) (Theorem 1). Second, we extend the results to psqt (x) case: the coefficient size of the scaled inverse of (xi - xj ) is bounded by q - 1 with the scale not greater than q modulo psqt (x) (Theorem 3).
Our results have applications in cryptography. For instance, they are closely related to the efficiency and quality of certain zero-knowledge proofs regarding lattice-based cryptosystems with Z2k -messages [CKL21].5
Along the way of proving the theorems, we prove several properties of {xk}kZ in Z[x]/pq(x) which might be of independent interest (Section 4). We also investigate so-called expansion factors of {xk}kZ in Z[x]/ps (x) and Z[x]/psqt (x), which also play important roles in zero-knowledge proofs regarding lattice-based cryptosystems [CKL21]. The expansion factor of f (x) in Z[x]/M (x) is defined as the maximum value of (||f (x) · g(x)||/||g(x)||) (Section 6).

2 Preliminaries
2.1 Notations
In this subsection, we list notations which we will use throughout the paper, especially the ones which might be ambiguous to some readers.
­ Throughout the paper, p, q are primes satisfying p < q, and s, t are positive integers, even if they are not explicitly mentioned.
­ We denote the M th cyclotomic polynomial as M (x) and denote the Euler's totient function as (·), i.e. (M ) = deg M (x).
5 Utilization of 2n (x) cyclotomic rings gives much worse efficiency in this case.

­ We carefully distinguished the use of " mod M (x)"6 and " (mod M (x))"7. We use "modM (x)" as a unary function which reduces the input polynomial modulo M (x) so that the degree of the output is less than (M ). On the other hand, we use " (mod M (x))" to express a certain equality holds for residue classes under M (x). For example, "a(x) = b(x) mod M (x)" says that, when b(x) is fully reduced modulo M (x), the result is exactly equal to a(x) as a polynomial in Z[x]. On the contrary, "a(x) = b(x) (mod M (x))" says that a(x) and b(x) belong to same residue class under M (x).
­ We define the maximum norm || · || of f (x)  Z[x] as the largest absolute value of coefficients of f (x). We define the maximum norm || · || of g(x)  Z[x]/M (x) as the largest absolute value of coefficients of (g~(x) mod M (x)), where g~(x)  Z[x] is a representative of g(x).
­ For a polynomial a(x)  Z[x], we denote the reverse polynomial of a(x) as rev(a(x)), i.e. rev(a(x)) = xdeg(a(x)) · a(1/x).
­ We denote the interval {i  Z|c  i  d} as [c, d].
­ We denote the greatest common divisor of a and b as (a, b).

2.2 Properties of Cyclotomic Polynomials

In this subsection, we recall and give short proofs on properties of cyclotomic polynomials p(x) and pq(x), which will be frequently used in the remaining parts of this paper. We only assume knowledge on basics of cyclotomic polynomials and very light knowledge on generating functions.

Lemma 2.

(a)

pq(1) = 1,

i.e.

pq (x)-1 x-1

is

a

polynomial.

(b) pq(x) is symmetric, i.e. rev(pq(x)) = pq(x).

Proof.

(a) Since p(x) · q(x) · pq(x) =

pq-1 i=0

xi

holds,

p·q

·

pq (1)

=

pq.

(b) pq(x) can be written as (

pq-1 i=0

xi)/(p(x)

·

q (x)).

Since

p(x)

·

q (x)

is

symmetric, pq(x) is a quotient of symmetric polynomials, where the de-

nominator divides the divisor.

Then, we can characterize bi as follows.

if p + q = i has a non-negative integer solution (, ). otherwise.

If

the

is

For

the

if

and

if

is

0

Proof.

(a) The equation  · p +  · q = t · p has a non-negative integer solution (t, 0).

(b) If  is positive,  · p +  · q  q holds. Therefore, for 0  i < q, the equation

 · p +  · q = i has a non-negative integer solution (, ) if and only if p

divides i.

3 Scaled Inverse of (xi - xj) modulo ps(x)
In this section, we prove Theorem 1 regarding the scaled inverse of (xi - xj ) modulo ps (x). Beforehand, we define the scaled inverse, and check its basic properties.

3.1 Scaled Inverse
Definition 1 (Scaled Inverse). Let f (x) be an irreducible polynomial over Z. The scaled inverse of a nonzero element a(x)  Z[x]/f (x) is the element b(x)  Z[x]/f (x) such that a(x)b(x) = c (mod f (x)) for the smallest possible positive integer c. We say b(x) is the scaled inverse of a(x) modulo f (x) with scale c.

Remark 1 (Existence). Let a(x)  Z[x] be the representative of a(x) where deg(a) < deg(f ). Note that (a(x), f (x)) = 1, since f (x) is irreducible. Thus, the resultant r := res(a(x), f (x)) is a nonzero integer. There exist Bezout coefficients s(x), t(x)  Z[x] such that s(x)a(x) + t(x)f (x) = r, deg(s) < deg(f ), and deg(t) < deg(a). Thus, there exists a scaled inverse with scale not greater than r.
Remark 2 (Uniqueness). Note the uniqueness of Bezout coefficients s~(x), t~(x)  Q[x] such that s~(x)a(x) + t~(x)f (x) = 1, deg(s~) < deg(f ), and deg(t~) < deg(a). Followingly, (cs~(x) mod f (x)) is the unique scaled inverse.
Remark 3 (Formulation). Let cont(s) be the positive content of s(x). Let d be (r, cont(s)). Then, it is easy to see that b(x) := s(x)/d mod f (x) is the scaled inverse with scale c := r/d.

3.2 Proof of Theorem 1
Theorem 1. Let p be a prime and M = ps be a prime power. For any i, j  Z satisfying 0  j < i < M , there exists u(x)  Z[x]/M (x) such that
· (xi - xj) · u(x) = p (mod M (x)) · and ||u(x)||  p - 1.
Theorem 1 says the coefficient size of the scaled inverse of (xi -xj) is bounded by p - 1 with the scale p modulo ps (x). Regarding Remark 3, u(x) is indeed the scaled inverse: coefficients of u(x) is already smaller than p, which is the only non-identity factor of p.
For readers' comprehension, we first review the proof of s = 1 case which was previously presented in [CKL21]. The full proof of Theorem 1 is a straightforward generalization of the s = 1 case. However, the full proof requires unpleasant notations and computations. Readers might want to first read the s = 1 case and catch the outline of the full proof.

Proof ([CKL21] s = 1 Case). Consider the following polynomial in Z[x].

v(x)

:=

p(x) - x-1

p

=

p-1
(p

-

-

·

k=0

We claim that u~(x) := -xp-j · v(xi-j )  Z[x] satisfies the conditions after being
reduced by p(x). By definition, the first condition can be easily checked with the fact that p(x) divides p(xi-j ) since (p, i - j) = 1.
Since p does not divide i - j, when reduced modulo xp - 1, each monomials
of u~(x) are reduced to distinct-degree monomials with coefficients remaining in the interval [1 - p, 0]. Let us denote the th coefficient of (u~(x) mod xp - 1) as u~  [1 - p, 0]. Applying modulo p(x) to (u~(x) mod xp - 1), the th coefficients
of (u~(x) mod p(x)) equals u~ - u~(p-1). Certainly, u~ - u~(p-1) lies in the interval of [1 - p, p - 1]. Thus, the inequality ||u~(x) mod p(x)||  p - 1 holds. 

6

J. H. Cheon et al.

Now we give the actual proof of Theorem 1 for arbitrary s.

Proof (Theorem 1). Let p be the largest power of p dividing i - j, and let  := (i - j)/p. Let us denote M  = ps-1. Consider the following polynomial
v(x)  Z[x].

v(x)

:=

M (x ) - p xp - 1

=

p(xM ) - p xM - 1

·

xM - 1 xp - 1

p-1
= (p - 1 - k) x(Mk) + x(Mk+p) + · · · + x(Mk+M-p)

k=0

We claim that u~(x) = -xM-j · v(x)  Z[x] satisfies the conditions after being

reduced by M (x). By definition, the first condition can be easily checked with the fact that M (x) divides M (x) since (M, ) = 1.

For the second condition, first observe that the degrees of monomials with

nonzero coefficients in u~(x) are same modulo p. Moreover, the coefficients of

u~(x) are in the interval of [1-p, 0]. Since (M, ) = 1, when reduced modulo xM -

1, each monomials of u~(x) are reduced to distinct-degree monomials (degrees

being same modulo p) with coefficients remaining in the interval of [1 - p, 0].

Let us denote the th coefficient of (u~(x) mod xM - 1) as u~  [1-p, 0]. Applying modulo M (x) to (u~(x) mod xM - 1), the th coefficients of (u~(x) mod M (x)) equals u~ - u~m, where m is the largest integer which equals  modulo M  and

less than M . Certainly, u~ - u~m lies in the interval of [1 - p, p - 1]. Thus, the

inequality ||u~(x) mod M (x)||  p - 1 holds.



We remark that Theorem 1 is tight: when i = 1 and j = 0, the 0th coefficient of u(x) is p - 1 and followingly ||u(x)|| = p - 1.

4 Properties of {xk}kZ modulo pq(x)
In this section, we prove several properties of {xk}kZ in Z[x]/pq(x). These results are not only the essence of the proof of Theorem 2 in Section 5, but also could be of independent interest.

4.1 Properties of {xk}kZ modulo pq(x)
Lemma 4. The following equalities hold for 0  k  p - 1.

x(pq)+k mod pq(x) = x(pq)+k - pq (x) · xi

||x(pq)+k mod pq(x)|| = 1

as

·

1 - xk+1 1 - xq

= (1 + xp + x2p + · · · + x(q-1)p) · (1 - xk+1) · (1 + xq + x2q + · · · )

Now we can interpret di's combinatorially. That is, for Diophantine equations

p + q = i

(1)

p + q = i - (k + 1),

(2)

1  di = -1
0

if (1) has a non-negative integer solution (, ) but (2) does not. if (2) has a non-negative integer solution (, ) but (1) does not. otherwise.

Therefore, we proved that ||x(pq)+k - pq(x) ·

k i=0

xi ||

=

1.

Equation (1) has a non-negative integer solution for (pq)  i  (pq) + k

(Corollary 1 (c)). On the other hand, the equation (2) has non-negative integer

solutions for any (pq)  i < (pq) + k (Lemma 3, Corollary 1 (b),(d)). Fur-

thermore, it is easy to see that equation (2) has no solution for i = (pq) + k,

since

deg(

pq (x)-1 x-1

)

=

(pq)

-

(Lemma

3).

Together

with

the

combinatorial

characterization of di, di = 0 holds for (pq)  i < (pq) + k and di = 1 holds

for i = (pq) + k. Then, the lemma follows.



Corollary 2. For 0  k < p - 1, the 0th coefficient of (x(pq)+k mod pq(x)) equals -1.

Proof. The corollary follows from Lemma 4 and the fact that pq(0) = 1 by

Lemma 2 (b).



Corollary 3. For 0  k < p - 1, the ((pq) - 1)th coefficient of (x(pq)+k mod pq(x)) is 1.

Proof. Considering the following equalities, the corollary follows from Lemma 4 and Corollary 1 (b),(d).

Lemma 5. The following equality holds for p - 1  k  q - 1.

p-2
x(pq)+k mod pq(x) = -xk-(p-1) xq·i

Proof. The lemma directly follows from the following equalities. The first equality is from Lemma 4.

Lemma 6. The following equality holds for 0  k < pq - (pq).

rev x(pq)+k mod pq(x) = xpq-1-k mod pq (x)

Proof. Let x(pq)+k mod pq(x) = x(pq)+k - f (x) · pq(x). Note that deg(f ) < pq - (pq). By the symmetry of pq(x) (Lemma 2 (b)), the following equalities hold.

rev x(pq)+k mod pq(x) = rev x(pq)+k - f (x) · pq(x)

= x(pq)-1 (1/x)(pq)+k - f (1/x) · pq(1/x)

= xpq-k-1 (mod pq(x))



Corollary 4. For all integer k, ||xk mod pq(x)|| = 1 holds.

Proof. This follows from Lemma 4, 5, 6.



4.2 Reduction Matrix
For a clearer demonstration, we end this section with a numerical example and how our results apply to it. Before we proceed, we define the reduction matrix RM of a cyclotomic polynomial M (x) as a (M )×M matrix with (i, j)-element being the ith coefficient of (xj mod M (x)) for 0  i < (M ) and 0  j < M .

Regarding Lemma 5, 6, we can describe Rpq as (I|B1|B2|B3), where B1, B3  Z(pq)×(p-1) and B2  Z(pq)×(q-p+1). Lemma 5 says that B2 is a very structured Toeplitz matrix and Lemma 6 says that B3 is a 180 rotation of B1. Corollary 4 says that every element of Rpq is in {-1, 0, 1}, Corollary 2 says that every
elements of the 0th row of B1 is -1, and Corollary 3 says that every elements of the ((pq) - 1)th row of B1 is 1. We can check all these properties with R3·7 which is listed below without zeroes written down.

Remark 4. Let M¯ be the largest square-free divisor of M and M  = M/M¯ . Since M (x) = M¯ (xM ), RM equals RM¯ I, where  denotes the Kronecker product.
In particular, Rps = Rp  I and Rpsqt = Rpq  I hold.

4.3 Patterns in Reduction Matrix

Lemma 7. The following inequality holds.

Proof.

(xj+ip mod pq(x)) = xj · xip (mod pq(x))

= xj · pq(x) · q(x) (mod pq(x))

10

J. H. Cheon et al.



Lemma 8. For any 0  k < (pq) and 0  j < p, there are at most two i's in {0, 1, 2, · · · , q - 1} such that the kth coefficient of (xj+ip mod pq(x)) is nonzero.

Proof. Combining the facts that nonzero kth coefficients of (xj+ip mod pq(x))

are either -1 or +1 (Corollary 4) and they sum up to zero (Lemma 7), it is

sufficient to show that there are at most three i's with nonzero kth coefficient of

(xj+ip mod pq(x)).

Revisiting the reduction matrix (I|B1|B2|B3), at most one column corresponding to one of {xj+ip}i may lie in each of B1, B3  Z(pq)×(p-1). In the kth row of the reduction matrix, I has the only nonzero element at the co-

ordinate of (k, k) and B2 may have nonzero element only at the coordinate of

(k, pq-q+k-qk/q) if this coordinate lies in B2. However, k = pq-q+k-qk/q

(mod p) for any 0  k < (pq). Hence, the lemma is proved.



Lemma 9. For any subset I  {0, 1, 2, · · · , q - 1} and 0  j < p, the following inequality holds.

xj+ip mod pq(x)

1

iI



Proof. From Lemma 7, 8, and Corollary 4, it is easy to see that the kth coeffi-

cients of {xj+ip mod pq(x)}0i<q are either all zero, or all zero except for one

+1 and one -1. Subset-sums of these sets are in -1, 0, 1.



Corollary 5. Let M = psqt and M  = M/(pq) be integers where s and t are
positive integers. For any integer 0  j < p and any family of subsets Ik  {0, 1, 2, · · · , q - 1} on 0  k < M , the following inequality holds.

M -1 k=0 iIk

x(j+ip)M+k mod M (x)

1


Proof. Since x(j+ip)M+k mod M (x) has nonzero coefficients only at the de-
grees those equal to k modulo M , terms with distinct k do not interfere with each others. Therefore, it is sufficient to prove the following inequality, which can be obtained from Lemma 9 with x substituted by xM .

5 Scaled Inverse of (xi - xj) modulo psqt(x)
In this section, we prove Theorem 2 and 3 regarding the scaled inverse of (xi -xj) modulo psqt (x). We begin with Theorem 2. Theorem 2 says the coefficient size of

On the Scaled Inverse of (xi - xj)

11

the (scaled) inverse of (xi -xj ) is bounded by p-1 modulo psqt (x), if ps  (i-j) and qt  (i - j). The proof outline is similar to the proof of Theorem 1. However,
the details require the results in Section 4.

Theorem 2. Let p and q be primes satisfying p < q, and let M = psqt be an integer where s and t are positive integers. For any integers 0  j < i < M satisfying ps  (i - j) and qt  (i - j), there exists u(x)  Z[x]/M (x) such that
· (xi - xj) · u(x) = 1 (mod M (x)) · and ||u(x)||  p - 1.

Proof. Let p be the largest power of p dividing i - j, let q be the largest power of q dividing i - j, and let  := (i - j)/(pq). Let us denote M  = ps-1qt-1.
Consider the following polynomial v(x)  Z[x]. Note that   s-1 and   t-1
by the assumption.

v(x)

:=

M (x ) - 1 xpq  - 1

=

pq(xM ) - 1 xM - 1

·

xM - 1 xpq  - 1

We claim that u~(x) = -xM-j · v(x)  Z[x] satisfies the conditions after being

reduced by M (x). By definition, the first condition can be easily checked by the fact that M (x) divides M (x ) since (M, ) = 1.

For the second condition, first observe that the degrees of monomials with

nonzero coefficients in u~(x) are same modulo pq. Moreover, the coefficients

of u~(x) are either -1 or 0 by Lemma 3. Since (M, ) = 1, when reduced mod-

ulo xM - 1, each monomials of u~(x) are reduced to distinct-degree monomials

(degrees being same modulo pq) with coefficients remaining in {-1, 0}.

Since there are no monomials with a degree of multiple of pM  in v(x) (Corol-

lary 1 (a)), we can group the monomials of (u~(x) mod M (x)) into p - 1 classes

according to the setting of Corollary 5. Then applying Corollary 5 together with

the triangle inequality, we are done.



We remark that Theorem 2 is quite tight according to the following lemma.8

Lemma 10. For u(x) defined in Theorem 2 with i = ps-1qt-1(p - 1) and j = ps-1qt-1(p - 2), the following inequality holds.

||u(x)||  p - 2

Proof. Using the proof of Theorem 2 and the following equalities, we can reduce the general case to the M = pq case with s = 1 and t = 1.

||u(x)|| = =

-xM -j

M (x ) - 1 xpq  - 1

8 We remark that there are M 's whose u(x) satisfy ||u(x)||  p - 2 for all i and j (e.g. 35). On the other hand, there are also M 's whose u(x) satisfy ||u(x)|| = p - 1 for some i and j (e.g. 33).

First, observe that deg(u~)  (pq) - 1. Then, by the following equalities, u~(x) satisfies the first condition of Theorem 2 after being reduced by pq(x).

u~(x) · (xp-1 - xp-2) = u~(x) · xp-2 · (x - 1)

Observe that the 0th coefficient of u~(x) equals -(p - 2). This easily follows

from the fact that pq(0) = 1. (Lemma 2 (b)) Thus, ||u~(x)||  p - 2.



Theorem 3 is an extension of Theorem 2 with the help of Theorem 1. Theorem 3 says the coefficient size of the scaled inverse of (xi - xj) is bounded by
q - 1 with the scale not greater than q modulo psqt (x). Regarding Remark 3 and the proof of Theorem 3, u(x) is indeed the scaled inverse: coefficients of u(x)
is not divisible by the scale.

Theorem 3. Let p and q be primes satisfying p < q, and let M = psqt be an integer where s and t are positive integers. For any integers 0  j < i < M , there exists u(x)  Z[x]/M (x) such that

· (xi - xj) · u(x) = c (mod M (x)), · and ||u(x)||  d,

 (q, q - 1),  where (c, d) = (p, p - 1),  (1, p - 1),

if ps | (i - j) if qt | (i - j)
otherwise.

Proof. If ps  (i - j) and qt  (i - j), use Theorem 2 to get u(x) with (xi - xj) ·
u(x) = 1 (mod M (x)) and ||u(x)||  p - 1. If ps | (i - j), let q be the largest power of q dividing i - j, and let  :=
(i-j)/(psq). Consider the following polynomial v(x)  Z[x]. Note that   t-1
by the assumption.

v(x)

:=

qt (xps ) - q xpsq  - 1

=

q (xpsqt-1 ) - q xpsqt-1 - 1

·

xpsqt-1 - 1 xpsq  - 1

We claim that u~(x) = -xM-j ·v(x)  Z[x] satisfies the conditions with c = q after

being reduced by M (x). By definition, the first condition can be easily checked by the fact that psqt (x) divides qt (xps ) since ps, qt, and  are mutually coprime. The second condition can be shown by the same argument in the proof

of Theorem 1.

If qt | (i - j), switch the role of p and q in the case of ps | (i - j). Then, we

get u(x) with (xi - xj) · u(x) = p (mod M (x)) and ||u(x)||  p - 1.



6 Expansion Factors of xk modulo ps(x) and psqt(x)

In this section, we examine so-called expansion factors of {xk}kZ in Z[x]/M (x) with M = ps or M = psqt. The expansion factor of f (x) in Z[x]/M (x) is defined
as the maximum value of (||f (x) · g(x)||/||g(x)||) upon g(x)  Z[x]/M (x). The following lemmas say that the expansion factors of {xk}kZ modulo ps (x)
and psqt (x) are not too large. These lemmas are generalizations of the power-oftwo case: the expansion factors of {xk}kZ modulo 2s (x) are 1, since multiplying xk in Z[x]/2s (x) acts as skewed -rotation of the coefficients. The statements and
proofs follow the framework of the p case which is described in [CKL21]. The
results are also closely related to the quality of certain zero-knowledge proofs
regarding lattice-based cryptosystems.

Lemma 11. For R = Z[x]/ps (x), the following equality holds.

max
kZ g(x)R

||xk · g(x)|| ||g(x)||

=2

Proof. Consider the reduction matrix of ps (x). Since any row of the matrix has

two nonzero elements and they are either -1 or +1, ||xk · g(x)||  2 · ||g(x)||

holds for all 0  k < ps. Thus, the expansion factors of {xk}kZ are not greater

than 2.

Note that the (p - 1)th coefficient of xp-1 · (-x + 1) mod p(x) is 2. Sub-

stituting x with xps-1 , we can see that the expansion factor of xk in R with

k = (p - 1) · ps-1 equals 2.



Lemma 12. For R = Z[x]/psqt (x), the following equality holds.

max
kZ g(x)R

||xk · g(x)|| ||g(x)||

= 2p

Proof. Consider each row of the reduction matrix Rpq = (I|B1|B2|B3). The matrices I and B2 contain at most one nonzero element in each row. Considering the dimensions of the matrix B1 and B3, they contain at most p - 1 nonzero elements in each row. In total, any row of Rpq has at most 2p nonzero elements and they are either -1 or +1 (Corollary 4). By Remark 4, any row of Rpsqt also has at most 2p nonzero elements and they are either -1 or +1. Therefore,

14

J. H. Cheon et al.

||xi · g(x)||  2p · ||g(x)|| holds for all i  Z, and the expansion factors of

{xk}kZ are not greater than 2p.

Combining Corollary 2, 3 and Lemma 5, 6, the ((pq) - 1)th row of Rpq

is of the form [0, · · · , 0, +1| + 1, · · · , +1|0, · · · , 0, -1| - 1, · · · , -1]. Thus, the

((pq) - 1)th coefficient of x(pq)-1 · [(1 + x + · · · + xp-1) - (xq + xq+1 + · · · +

xq+p-1)] mod pq(x) is 2p. Substituting x with x , ps-1qt-1 we can see that the

expansion factor of xk in R with k = ((pq) - 1) · ps-1qt-1 equals 2p.



7 Open Problems
An interesting problem is to generalize the results of this paper to ternary or even to arbitrary cyclotomic polynomials. Another direction is to investigate coefficient sizes of scaled inverses modulo cyclotomic polynomials for a wider range of polynomials than {xi - xj}i,j. Besides {xi}, constructing another large subset of Z[x]/M (x) (i) whose elements have small expansion factors (ii) and whose differences of elements have small scaled inverses is also an interesting open problem.
