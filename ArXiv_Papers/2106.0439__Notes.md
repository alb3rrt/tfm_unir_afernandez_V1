## Abstract

We consider viscosity solutions to a one-phase free boundary problem for the $p(x)$-Laplacian with non-zero right hand side. We apply the tools developed in \cite{D} to prove that flat free boundaries are $C^{1,\alpha}$. Moreover, we obtain some new results for the operator under consideration that are of independent interest.
