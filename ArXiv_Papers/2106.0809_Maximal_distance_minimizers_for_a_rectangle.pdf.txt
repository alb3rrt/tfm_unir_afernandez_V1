Abstract A maximal distance minimizer for a given compact set M  R2 and some given r > 0 is a set having the minimal length (one-dimensional Hausdorff measure) over the class of closed connected sets   R2 satisfying the inequality
max dist (y, )  r.
yM
This paper deals with the set of maximal distance minimizers for a rectangle M and small enough r.

1 Introduction
Let M be a compact planar set. For every compact set   R2 define the maximal distance functional
FM () := max dist (y, ),
yM
further the value FM () is called energy of . The following problem appeared in [1] and later has been studied in [11, 12].
Problem 1.1. For a given compact set M  R2 and r > 0 find a connected set  of minimal length (one-dimensional Hausdorff measure H1) such that
FM ()  r.

We use the following general results (see [12]).

· A solution of Problem 1.1 exists and has a finite length. We further call it a minimizer.

· A minimizer has no cycles (homeomorphic images of S1).

· The set of minimizers coincides with the set of solutions of the dual problem: minimize FM over all compact connected sets  with prescribed bound on the total length H1()  l. This item explains the name of the problem.

The result of our paper is the following

Theorem 1.2. Let M = A1A2A3A4 be a rectangle, 0 < r < r0(M ). Then a maximal distance minimizer has the following

topology with 21 segment, depicted in the left part of Fig. 1. The middle part of the picture contains enlarged fragment of the

near A1.

All maximal distance minimizers have length approximately P er - 8.473981r, where P er is the perimeter of the rectangle.

In fact, every maximal distance minimizer is very close (in the sense of Hausdorff distance) to the one depicted in the picture.

Structure of the paper. Subsections 1.1­1.3 contain notation and very basic facts on Problem 1.1 and Steiner problem. The rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.2.
Outline of the proof. In Section 2 we adapt several lemmas from [2] to M being a polygon. It turns out that  lies in the const · r-neighborhood of M (see Corollary 2.6).
Section 3 outlines auxiliary results from [3] concerning differentiation in the picture. We derive the conditions on optimality of  under motion of proper points y(x) for energetic x.
Section 4 shows that the main difficulties appear in a neighborhood of the angles of M . Lemma 4.3 shows that the intersection of  with the const · r-neighborhood of Ai is connected. Then we enclose  by adding a segment of length at most 2r. The resulting set  has a large cycle C. Subsection 4.2 shows that C has prescribed combinatorial structure.
At this point we know that C covers all M except const · r-neighborhoods of angles. In Section 5 we describe the computer search we use to find an optimal way to cover those neighborhoods. It is enough to consider a union of C with a Steiner tree on at most 4 special points. Subsection 5.1 deals with error terms. As a result of the search we conclude that every minimizer lies in a small box in configurational space around a certain point p0.
In Section 6 we consider all Steiner topologies on at most 4 points one by one. It turns out that all the topologies except the answer provide longer configurations than p0; the answer provides a shorter one.
Finally, in Section 7 we discuss the uniqueness of a solution for a rectangle and refer to some related open questions.
1.1 Energetic points
Let B(x) be the open ball of radius  centered at a point x, and let B(T ) be the open -neighborhood of a set T i.e.
B(T ) := B(x).
xT
Note that the condition FM ()  r in Problem 1.1 is equivalent to M  Br(). The following definition plays central role in the study of minimizers, in particular in the proof of Theorem 1.2.
Definition 1.3. Let  be a minimizer for M and r. A point x   is called energetic, if for all  > 0 one has
FM ( \ B(x)) > r.
The following properties of energetic points have been proved in [11] and [12].
(a) For every energetic point x there is a point y  M , such that dist (x, y) = r and Br(y)   = . We say that point y is a corresponding point to x and denote it y(x). Note that such y may be not unique.
(b) For every non-energetic point x there is an  > 0, such that   B(x) is either a line segment or a regular tripod, i.e. the union of three line segments with an endpoint in x and relative angles of 2/3. If a point x is a center of a regular tripod, then it is called a Steiner point (or a branching point) of .
Theorem 1.4 (Teplitskaya, [14, 15]). Let  be a maximal distance minimizer for a compact set M  R2, r > 0. We say that the ray (ax] is a tangent ray of the set  at the point x   if there exists a non stabilized sequence of points xk   such that xk  x and xkxa  0. Then
(i)  is a union of a finite number of injective images of the segment [0, 1];
(ii) the angle between each pair of tangent rays at every point of  is greater or equal to 2/3;
(iii) the number of tangent rays at every point of  is not greater than 3. If it is equal to 3, then there exists such a neighbourhood of x that the arcs in it coincide with line segments and the pairwise angles between them are equal to 2/3.
1.2 Notation
For a given set X  R2 we denote by X its closure, by Int (X) its interior and by X its topological boundary. For given points B, C  R2 we use the notation [BC], [BC) and (BC) for the corresponding closed line segment, ray and
line respectively. We denote by ]BC] and ]BC[ the corresponding semiopen and open segments, and by |BC| the length of these segments.
For rays [BC), [CD) let  ([BC), [CD)) stand for the directed angle from [BC) to [CD) with respect to the clockwise orientation. By definition  ([BC), [CD))  [0, 2).
For a polygonal chain B1, . . . , Bn define its turning as follows
n-2
turn B1, . . . , Bn :=  ([BiBi+1), [Bi+1, Bi+2)) .
i=1
2

Note that for a closed (i.e. B1 = Bn) and non-self-intersecting chain its turning is equal to ±2. For a    define the part of M , which is covered by : () := M  Br().
If y  M (Y  M ) is contained in () (is a subset of ()) we say that  covers y (Y ). We use denotation ox(1) for a quantity, which tends to zero with x. Note that o(x) = xox(1).
1.3 Steiner problem
The Steiner problem has several different but more or less equivalent formulations; we need the following one. Let S be a finite planar set of points, the problem is to find a connected set St of minimal length such that S  St. Vertices from S are called terminals. It is well-known that a solution exists, and may be not unique.
It is also known that St consists of line segments and the angle between two segments adjacent to the same vertex is greater or equal than 2/3. Let us call a Steiner (or branching) point such a point of  that does not belong to S and which is not an interior point of a segment of . It turns out that a Steiner point x is adjacent to exactly 3 line segments. Hence the angle between any pair of segments adjacent to x is equal to 2/3.
In particular we need to consider this problem for S = {x1, x2, x3}. It is well-known that for such S the Steiner problem has a unique solution. If x1, x2, x3 form a triangle with all angles smaller than 2/3, then
St(x1, x2, x3) = [x1T ]  [x2T ]  [x3T ], where T is the point satisfies x1T x2 = x1T x3 = x2T x3 = 2/3 (T is usually called Fermat point or Torricelli point). Consider outward equilateral triangle x1x2X (i.e. X and x3 lie on different sides of (x1x2)). It is known that X, T and x3 belong to the same line.
In the other case there is an angle of size at least 2/3, say, x1x2x3. The only solution is St(x1, x2, x3) = [x1x2]  [x2x3].
For a more detailed survey see book [8] and paper [5]. Further we use Melzak algorithm [10] to find Steiner trees on at most four terminals.
2 Adapting of the horseshoe method
Definition 2.1. Let M be a closed convex curve. By N we denote conv M . By Mr we denote N  Br(M ). Finally, Nr is conv Mr (see Fig. 2).
M
Mr
N
Nr r
Figure 2: Definitions of N , Mr, N , and Nr Finding the set of solutions for a given M is a rather difficult problem. The only known nontrivial result is the following. Theorem 2.2 (Cherkashin ­ Teplitskaya, 2018 [2]). Suppose that r > 0, and M is a convex closed curve with the radius of curvature at least 5r. Let  be an arbitrary minimizer for M . Then  is the union of an arc of Mr and two tangent segments to Mr at the ends of the arc (i.e. it is a horseshoe, see Fig. 3). In the case of M being a circumference with radius R, one can weaken the assumption to R > 4.98r.

M 

Figure 3: The horseshoe
In this section we adapt several lemmas from [2] to the case of rectangle. Note that the finiteness of H1() implies that  is path-connected (see, for example, [4]). By the absence of loops the path in  between every couple of points of  is unique.
Lemma 2.3. Let N be convex,  be an arbitrary minimizer for M . Then  is a subset of N .
Proof. Suppose the contrary, then one can project  \ N on N , and the length strictly decreases.
Lemma 2.4. (i) The closure of every connected component of   Int (Nr) is a solution of the Steiner problem for some set of points belonging to Mr, and in particular consists only of line segments of positive length.
(ii) The length of any line segment in   Nr does not exceed 2r.
Proof. Let S be the closure of an arbitrary connected component of   Int (Nr). Clearly all points of S are non-energetic. Since  consists of a finite number of curves, S   contains only finite number of branching points (see [14, 15]) and thus the set S  Mr is finite. No change in the set Int (  Nr) influences the value of FM (), so if we replace S with a Steiner tree connecting S  Mr, then the length of the resulting set should remain the same by the optimality of , and thus S is itself a Steiner tree connecting S  Mr as claimed.
Assume the contrary to the statement of item (ii), i.e. there exists a segment [AB]    Nr with a length greater than 2r. As  doesn't contain loops, the set  \ ]AB[ consists of exactly two connected components, let us call them 1 and 2; these connected components are closed. By the definition (1) and (2) are closed and, as set M is connected, the set (1)  (2) is not empty. Let us consider an arbitrary point A  (1)  (2). As the sets 1 and 2 are closed, there exists such points 1  1 and 2  2 that dist (A, 1), dist (A, 2)  r. Then 1  2  [A1]  [A2] has smaller length and not greater energy than . So we get a contradiction.
It appears that  is located near the boundary of M .

Then  has no branching points in the area Int Kr.

Proof. Since the length of a segment of  in Int Nr is not greater than 2r, it is easy to see that for an arbitrary point a   the statement B4r(a) Int Nr holds. Otherwise let us consider such a point a. Recall that each point of  in Int Nr is a center of a segment or of a regular tripod, and all segments are not longer than 2r. Then there exists such a regular hexagon with sides of length 2r, angles of 2/3 and a vertex in a, that it has to contain an endpoint of . However this is impossible since this hexagon is contained inside the ball B4r(a) which lies in Int Nr and therefore does not contain energetic points of .
We define set Kl  N as follows (see Fig. 5):

Suppose the opposite to the assertion of the lemma: let Int Kr contain a branching point. Then consider a branching

point on the innermost layer: let a  Kl(a) be such a branching point that l(a) > r is maximal. Let a lie on the interior of a

side of Kl(a). Then one or two segments of  of length at most 2r go from a into Int Kl(a). We are going to show that the

end of at least one of them is contained in Int Kl(a). Since the end of the segment can only be at the branching point, this

would contradict the choice of l(a). Indeed, if only one segment goes into Int Kl(a), the statement is obvious. Let us examine

in detail the case where two segments go out in Int Kl(a).

Figure 6: The case when two segments go out in Int Kl(a)
Let none of these segments end in Int Kl(a). Then both segments intersect the sides of Kl(a); it is clear that these sides are adjacent to the one, containing point a. Let us denote the ends of the side on which a lies as B1 and B2, and the points

5

of intersection of the tripod segments with the sides outgoing from B1 and B2, as C1 and C2, respectively (see Fig. 6). Let B1aC1 = . Then

aC1B1  /3 - , B2aC2 = /3 - , aC2B2  .

Moreover, |aC1|, |aC2|  2r. Hence, by the law of sines

 Thus the length of the side of Kl, containing a point a, is equal to |aB1| + |aB2| < 4r/ 3. This contradicts the condition on the length of the minimal side of Kl.
Now, let point a coincide with a vertex of Kl(a), then there exists a segment of  with one end at a and another end in Int Kl(a) or at the interior of a side Kl(a). The first case contradicts the definition of l(a), and the second has already been considered. Thus the initial assumption about the presence of branching points in Int Kr was wrong.

Corollary 2.6. The statement   Pr =  holds.

Proof. The set  has no terminal points or points of order 2 in the set Int Nr  Int Kr, all segments of   Int Nr are not longer than 2r, and  has no branching points in the area Int Kr. Then the ends of any segment s intersecting area Int Kr lie on Kr not farther than 2r from vertices of Kr, and hence are at a distance not greater than (pM (i) + 2)r from vertices of Mr. Then all points of s are located at a distance at most 1 + (pM (i) + 2)2r from the vertices of M .

3 Derivation in the picture
The following lemma is essentially proved in [2]; we prove it for sake of completeness.
Lemma 3.1. (i) Let Q be an energetic point of degree 1 (i.e. Q is the end of the segment [QX]  ) with unique y(Q). Then Q, X and y(Q) lie on the same line.
(ii) Let W be an energetic point of degree 2 (i.e. W is the end of the segments [W Z1] and [W Z2]  ) with unique y(W ). Then Z1W y(W ) = y(W )W Z2.
Proof. Suppose the contrary to (i), then Y := Br(y(Q))  [y(Q)X] differs from Q. Replace [QX] with [Y X] in . Clearly M is still covered; by the triangle inequality r + |Y X| = |y(Q)X| < |y(Q)Q| + |QX| = r + |QX|, so the length of  decreases with the replacement. Contradiction.
Suppose the contrary to (ii) i.e. that Z1W y(W ) = y(W )W Z2. Let l be the tangent line to Br(y(W )) at the point W . Then
H1(  B(W )) - H1([Z1Y ]  [Y Z2]) = O(),
where Z1 and Z2 are intersections of segments Z1Y and Z2Y with B(W ), and Y is such a point in l that Z1Y y(W ) = y(W )Y Z2 (see Fig. 7). On the other hand, dist (Y, Br(y(W ))) = O(2); let V  Br(y(W1)) be such a point that dist (Y, Br(y(W ))) = dist (Y, V ). Then the set ( \ B(W ))  [Z1Y ]  [Z2Y ]  [Y V ] is connected, covers M and has strictly lower length than , giving a desired contradiction.
In this section we use results from [3]. The facts stated below hold for a convex smooth curve M with radius of curvature more than r. They are also applicable for a partially smooth M when y1 is a smooth point.
Consider a point y1  M such that Br(y1)   = . Suppose there exists an energetic point x  Br(y1) \ Mr. Denote the order of x as d  {1, 2}, and the number of corresponding points y(x) as k  {1, 2} (denote the second such point as y2, if it exists).
Fix a small enough l so that Bl(x)   is a union of d segments of the form [zix], zi  Bl(x), 1  i  d. Let  > 0 be sufficiently small and denote by y1 the point obtained by moving y1 along M a distance  in such direction that x / Br(y1).

Figure 7: Picture near the point W in Lemma 3.1, case (ii).
Similarly, for a sufficiently small  < 0 denote by y1 the point obtained by moving y1 along M a distance - in the other direction. In the case k = 2 denote y2 = y2.
Let
d
() = min |zix |,
x i=1
there the minimum is over all points x which satisfy |yjx | = r for 1  j  k. Denote by x the point achieving the value of ().
Note that x0 = x because  is a minimizer. By the derivative of length of  in a neighborhood of x when moving y1(x) along M we mean the derivative of () in zero  (0).
Proposition 3.2. Let M be a convex smooth curve with radius of curvature more than r;  be an arbitrary minimizer for M , r. Let x   be an energetic point, y(x)  M be an arbitrary corresponding point. Then the derivative of length of  in a neighborhood of x when moving y along M is nonnegative.
Proposition 3.3. Let y  M be a point such that Br(y)   =  and Br(y) contains energetic points x1 and x2. Define Y = Br(y)  Mr. Then
(i) points x1 and x2 lie on opposite sides of the line (yY );
(ii) derivatives of length of  in neighborhoods of x1 and x2 when moving y along M are equal.
Also in [3] the derivative of length of  in a neighborhood of x when moving y along M is calculated. The derivative depends on the behavior of  in the neighborhood of x. In the present paper we need the following cases.
1. x has order 1, and there is unique corresponding y(x). Then the derivative is equal to
cos ,
where  = ([xy(x)), l), l is a tangent ray to M at point y(x), in the direction of increasing (x).
2. x has order 2, and the unique corresponding y(x). Since x has order 2, B(x)   = [xz1]  [xz2] for small enough  > 0. Then the derivative is equal to
2 cos  cos z1xz2 , 2
where  = ([xy(x)), l), l is a tangent ray to M at point y(x), in the direction of increasing (x).
4 The behavior of  near the angles of M
The major part of lemmas in this section require M to be a polygon A1 . . . An with angles at least /3. Some lemmas use stronger restrictions on M .

4.1 Enclosing of a minimizer
Let Ci(t-i , t+i ) be a quadrangle, which is bounded by perpendiculars to the sides of M , which are incident to Ai and at a distance of (pM (i) + 2 + t±i )r from Ai (where t±i  [0; 2] will be chosen during the proof for every Ai and for each sides incident to it). Let us define heptagon i(t-i , t+i ) as follows:
i(t-i , t+i ) := Ci(t-i , t+i ) \ Pr, i = 1 . . . n. Note that in light of Corollary 2.6 it is true that i(t-i , t+i )  Ci(t-i , t+i )\Pr. We show that for some choice of parameters t±i this intersection consists of exactly two points. Lemma 4.1. There exists such (t±1 , t±2 , . . . , t±n ) that  intersects a boundary of each heptagon i(t-i , t+i ) exactly at two points.

Proof. Clearly, in view of connectivity of  and Corollary 2.6 for arbitrary t-, t+ there is at most one point x  M \

(

n i=1

i(t-

,

t+

))

such

that Br(x)   = .

Then

energetic

terminal points of

the set

 \ Br(

n i=1

i(t-, t+))

belong

to

the

circumference Br(x) if such point x exists, and don't exist otherwise.

Then each connected component of  \

n i=1

i

(t-i ,

t+i )

is

a

minimal

network,

contained

in

N

\ Nr

and

connecting

points

from sets Br(x)  N and i(t-i , t+i ) \ (Nr  M ) for some i. Moreover each connected component connects points from exactly two sets, and there are no two components connecting the same pair of sets.

It is easy to see that if there is i such that (Ci(t-i , t) \ M  )  2 for any t  [0; 2], then in view of the co-area inequality, the length of  on the part of the rectangle N \ Nr between two perpendiculars drawn at the distance (pM (i) + 2)r

and (pM (i) + 4)r from Ai is 4r. Then the replacement of the indicated subset of  with three sides of this rectangle (two

perpendiculars to M and a side that is contained in Mr) decreases the length and does not increase the energy, which contradicts the optimality of . Analogously we can fix t+i and variate t-i . Thus, for each i there are such t±i  [0; 2] that each of perpendiculars drawn at the distance (pM (i) + 2 + t±i )r from vertex Ai intersects  at exactly one point. In what follows, such Ci(t-i , t+i ) will be called Ci, and i(t-i , t+j ), accordingly, will be called i.

Thus   i consists of one or two connected components. As  is connected, there are at least n - 1 heptagons i such

that   i is connected. We want to show that all n heptagons are like this.

Note that inside the connected components of N \

n i=1

i

,

set 

has two variants of

behavior:

either it is a segment

connecting sides of i, or (there is at most one such component) it is a union of two segments, the distance between which is

(2 - or(1))r.

Proposition 4.2. Let segment [xa]   be such that |za| < r, where z := [xa)  M . And let ([ax])  H  Br( \ [ax[), where H is one of two half-planes bounded by (za). Then point a can not be terminal.

Proof. Let z  M \ H be such a point that [zz ]  Br(a)  M . And let a := B|z a|(z )  [xz ]. Then, in view of the triangle inequality for z ax inequality |xa | < |xa| holds. In addition, since the intersection Br(a)  M \ H outside [zz ] is on the such side of the perpendicular to [aa ] where the points are closer to a than to a, Br(a)  M \ H  Br(a )  M \ H executes. Thus set  \ [ax]  [a x] is shorter and has not greater energy than . If point a has degree 1, then set  \ [ax]  [a x] is connected, which contradicts the optimality of .
Lemma 4.3. For every heptagon i set   i is connected.
Proof. Assume the contrary, i.e. there exists such i, that
  i =: 1 2.

belonging to only one side (we will call this side the first). Clearly 1 is a segment: let z1 := i  1 and let z2 be such a

point of 1, that covers the closest to Ai point of the first side (we will refer to this point as y). Then set  \ 1  [z1z2] is

connected, has not greater energy and smaller length than , so 1 coincides with segment [z1z2]. As point z2 is energetic

and 1 covers only points of the first side, y is the single point corresponding to z2 (y = y(z2)), and in view of Lemma 3.1(i)

points z1, z2 and y belong to the same line. Clearly, dist (y, 1) = dist (y, 2) = r. As dist (1, 2) = (2 - or(1))r, all points

of (1  2)  Br(y) are located at the distance or(1)r from the first side (in particular; it means that point y cannot coincide

with Ai). Let x be an arbitrary point of 2  Br(y). Then x lies at the distance or(1)r from the first side. The order of

point x is either 1 or 2.

· Let x be an energetic point of order 2. Denote by a, b = x the ends of the maximal segments such that ([ax][xb])  .

­ Suppose there exists a point y1 = y corresponding to x. As Br(y1)   = Br(y)   =  the inequalities y1xa  /2 and yxb  /2 (without loss of generality, points a, y1, y and b are located in counterclockwise order) hold. Moreover, in view of the optimality of  the inequality axb  2/3 holds; then angle y1xy does not exceed /3, and thus y1  Br(y)  M . But it is impossible since the angle between [yx) and the side of M is or(1), and point y1 belongs to this angle, so |y1x| < r.
­ Let y be the single point corresponding to x. In view of Lemma 3.1(ii) there exists such maximal distance [ax], [bx]   that axb  2/3, [y(x)x) contains the bisector of axb, and y(x)xa, y(x)xb  /2, where y(x) is a point corresponding to x. Without loss of generality, ray [xa) is directed towards the line containing the first side. Denote by  the area bounded by ray [xa), straight line containing the first side and a circumference Br(y). In view of conditions on the point x, expression   Bo(r)(x)  Br(x) holds. Denote by H+ the half-plane, bounded
by (ax) and containing . Then H+  Br([ax])  N  Br(x), and thus, in view of Proposition 4.2, point a can not be energetic point of order 1. If a is an energetic point of order 2 or a branching point, then there exists such a segment [ac1]   that c1  Int . In view of Proposition 4.2 point c1 can not be an energetic point of order 1, in case if it is an energetic point of order 2 or a branching point, there exists a next point c2   such that the maximal segment ]c1c2[ Int  and [c1c2)  [xa) =  (and hence cuts off a half-plane without points covering by c2, thus in view of Proposition 4.2 point c2 can not have order 1). And so on, there exists an infinite sequence of points ci such that the maximal segments [cici+1]   satisfy ]cici+1[ Int  and [cici+1)  [xa) =  for every number i, which is impossible.

· Let x be an energetic point of order 1.

­ Let y be the single point corresponding to x. Consider the maximal segment [wx]  2. By Lemma 3.1(i)

the expression y  (wx) holds. Point w can not be an energetic point of order 2: assume the contrary, then, in view

of the expressions y(w)yw = y(w)yx = or(1) and |y(w)w| = r, there exists only one point y(w) corresponding

to w. Then in view of item (ii) of Lemma 3.1 inequality ((yw], (wy(w)])  /3 holds. But it contradicts the law

As  is connected, point w also can not be an energetic point of order 1. And w can not be a branching point, otherwise there will be such a maximal segment [wc1]  , that [wc1) intersects a line containing the first side. Denote by  an area, bounded by [wc1), [wx], M and Br(y). In what follows, we will apply the same reasoning to area  as to area  above. The distance from M to an arbitrary point of area  is o(r). As Br(y)   =  due to Proposition 4.2 point c1 can not be terminal. If c1 has order 2 or is branching point, there exists such a

9

maximal segment [c1c2]  , that ]c1c2[ Int  and [c1c2)  [wc1) = . And hence line (c1c2) cut off the half-line, where there is no points, covered by c2, so in view of Proposition 4.2 point c2 can not be of order 1. And so on, thus there exists an infinite sequence of such points ci that maximal segments [c1c2]   satisfy ]cici+1[ Int  and [cici+1)  [wc1) = , which is impossible.
­ Suppose there exists a point y = y, corresponding to x. As the distance from x to the first side is or(1)r, the point y also is at a distance or(1)r from the first side, otherwise the segment [yy ]  Br(y)  Br(y ) separates x from another points of . Thus the angle between the circles Br(y) and Br(y ) is or(1). Consider segment [xw]  2, then the angle between (xw) and the first side is /2 - or(1).
Let w := B(x)  [xw] for sufficiently small  > 0. Consider triangle yy w , there yw y =  - or(1) and |y w |, |yw | > r. Then one can replace in  segment [xw ] with segments [w v] and [w v ], where v := Br(y)[yw ], v := Br(y )  [y w ]. This replacement decreases the length: let t be the intersection point of the first side and line (xw ), then

|yv| = |yw | - r = |tw |2 + |ty|2 - 2|tw | · |ty| cos ytw - |tx|2 + |ty|2 - 2|tx| · |ty| cos ytw =

|tw |2 + |ty|2 - 2|tw | · |ty| cos ytw - |tx|2 + |ty|2 - 2|tx| · |ty| cos ytw . |tw |2 + |ty|2 - 2|tw | · |ty| cos ytw + |tx|2 + |ty|2 - 2|tx| · |ty| cos ytw

Since ytw

=

 2

-

or (1),

one

has

cos

ytw

= or(1) holds.

Hence the numerator of the similar expression for |yv |

is equal to

|tw |2 - |tx|2 + |ty|(|tw | - |tx|)or(1) = (|tw | - |tx|)(|tw | + |tx| + or(1)|ty|) = ror(1).

On the other hand, the denominator of the expression for |yv| is greater than 2r, thus |yv| = or(1), similarly |yv | = or(1). By the definition, |xw | = , thus the replacement reduces the length. Clearly it maintains connectivity and doesn't increase the energy.

Set N \ i \ Nr consists of n connected components, each of them is a rectangle, we denote it by li,i+1. As there are
no loops in , as in view of 2.6 statement   Pr =  holds and as   i is connected for every i, there is only one number j such that set   lj,j+1 consists of two connected components, for other numbers j sets   lj,j+1 are connected. Wherein li,i+1  M  (  li,i+1)for every i. As the sets   i  li,i+1 and   i+1  li,i+1 are points, each connected set   li,i+1
is a segment connecting these points. Let number i be such that   li,i+1 is not connected and let

i i+1 := li,i+1  ,

where j is connected for j = i, i + 1. Without loss of generality, j  j =  where j = i, i + 1. Denote aj := j  M  li,i+1 and bj := j    li,i+1. Thus (i)  (i+1)  [aiai+1].
Note that for arbitrary point y  li,i+1 inequality |ybi| > r or |ybi+1| > r holds. Then there exists such j  i, i + 1, that |bjy| > r, where y is the farthest from Aj point from set (j)  li,i+1. Thus j is a set of minimal length covering segment [ajy] and connecting point bj with set Br(y). Then j = [bjcj], where cj := [bjy]  Br(y). Hence point cj is energetic and y = y(cj) so Br(y)   = . The second connected component 2i+1-j also is a segment connecting Br(y) with b2i+1-j.
By Lemma 3.1(i) bj, cj and y are collinear, b2i+1-j, c2i+1-j and y are also collinear. So

|bj y| + |yb2i+1-j | = |bj cj | + |b2i+1-j c2i+1-j | + 2r.

It is well-known that the minimal length of |bjy| + |yb2i+1-j| over y  (aiai+1) is reached when the angle of incidence coincides with the angle of reflection, i.e.
bj yAj = A2i+1-j yb2i+1-j ;
obviously, such a point belongs to [A1An]. Hence [bici] and [bi+1ci+1] are almost parallel to A1An. Consider the following auxiliary problem.

Problem 4.4. Let M be a polygon and r < r0(M ). Find a connected set  of minimal length (one-dimensional Hausdorff measure H1) such that

FM ( )  r

and  has a cycle around Pr.

By the same standard compactness argument as in [11], Theorem 2.1 allows to prove that Problem 4.4 has a solution.

Recall that point y  M \

n i=1

i

satisfies

Br (y )



=

ci, ci+1

Br(y) 

.

Consider the set 1 :=   [cici+1];

clearly H1(1) - H1() = |cici+1|  2r. Also |cici+1| = (2 - or(1))r. Note that 1 contains a cycle C1 around Pr.

Let  be an arbitrary solution of Problem 4.4 with a cycle C around Pr. Obviously   Pr is empty and   li,i+1 is a

segment. Hence

H1( ) - H1() = 2r - o(r).

Now we want to find the topology of optimal  . We show that in the case of a rectangle the length of a set satisfying conditions of Problem 4.4 (except the minimal length) with another topology exceeds H1( ) by over 4 · 10-6r.

4.2 Study of C
First of all, note that C is a convex polygon with each angle no smaller than 2/3. Let C1, C2 be the points on rays [A1A2) and [A1A4), respectively, such that

|A1C1| = |A1C2| = (pM (1) + 3)r =

r.

Let D1, D2  Mr be such points that |C1D1| = |C2D2| = r. Denote S = conv{A1, C1, C2, D1, D2}. Consider C  S: the part of C in the vicinity of angle A1. We are going to show that for a more specific choice of A1 the set of inner vertices of polygonal chain C  S consists of two energetic points of degree two and a Steiner point between them.
Since A1 > /3, and long sides of C are almost parallel to sides of M

turn (C  S) =  - A1 + or(1) < 2/3.

Lemma 4.5. Let W  C be an energetic point of degree 2. Then y(W ) is unique.

Proof. Suppose the contrary, i.e. there exist different points y1(W ) and y2(W ). Suppose that y1(W ) and y2(W ) belong to the same side of M , without loss of generality it is A1A2 (in particular
yi(W ) may coincide with Ai). Put U1 = (Br(y1(W )))  Br(A1A2)  N , U2 = (Br(y2(W )))  Br(A1A2)  N . Since Br(y1(W ))   = Br(y2(W ))   = , convex polygon C crosses line (U1U2) twice at points Y1, Y2  [U1U2]. The length of [U1U2] is at most 2r; on the other hand, the corresponding side of Pr is a subset of line (U1U2) and has length bigger than 2r for r < r0(M ). Hence, C cannot be a cycle around Pr, contradiction.

Thus y1(W ) and y2(W ) belong to different sides of M . Suppose that |A1W |  r, then A1y1(W )W  W A1y1(W ) and A1y2(W )W  W A1y2(W ). By the sum of the angles in quadrangle A1y1(W )W y2(W ), we have

2

W = 2 - A1 - y1(W ) - y2(W )  2 - A1 - W A1y1(W ) - W A1y2(W ) = 2 - 2A1 >

. 3

So the angle between Br(y1(W )) and Br(y2(W )) is smaller than /3. So W cannot be a vertex of C, since all the angles of C have measure at least 2/3.
So |A1W | > |y2(W )W | = r and |A1W | > |y1(W )W | = r. Hence open circles Br(y1(W )) and Br(y2(W )) cannot intersect, otherwise  does not cover A1; so Br(y1(W )) and Br(y2(W )) are tangent. Again, W cannot be a vertex of C, since all the angles of C have measure at least 2/3; contradiction.

Lemma 4.6. C contains no energetic points W1, W2  S \ Mr of degree 2, such that [W1W2]   .

Proof. Suppose the contrary. By Lemma 4.5 there are unique points y(W1), y(W2). Consider the case that y(W1) and y(W2) belong to the same side of M , say [A1A2]. Put U1 = (Br(y(W1)))  Br(A1A2) 
N , U2 = (Br(y(W2)))  Br(A1A2)  N . Since Br(y(W1))   = Br(y(W2))   = , a convex polygon C intersects [U1U2] at two points. Since W1, W2  S, the length of [U1U2] is smaller than the length of the corresponding side of Pr. Hence C cannot be a cycle around Pr, contradiction.
In the case when y(W1) and y(W2) belong to different sides of M , polygonal chain y(W1)W1W2y(W2) splits M into two parts. The smaller part cannot be covered by  , because   Br(y(W1)) =  and   Br(y(W2)) = . We got a contradicion.

Now we analyze all possible arrangements of energetic points in C  S.

so polygonal chain C  S contains at least two inner vertices. By Lemma 4.6 they cannot all be energetic, so there is exactly

one Steiner point V  C  S.

By Lemma 4.6 there is at most one vertex of polygonal chain C  S on the both sides of V . Since we have at least two

vertices the only case (up to symmetry) we have to deal with is C  S = Z1W1V Z2, where W1 is an energetic point of degree

two, and V is a Steiner point.

Let [V T ] be the maximal segment of   C, containing V and different from [V Z2] and [V W1]. Then T cannot be a Steiner point, otherwise the depicted figure (bounded by V T , M and V Z2, see the right part of Fig. 12) contains an energetic point, which is an absurd.
Suppose that T is an energetic point of degree 2. Then no y(T ) can lie on [A1An], so all y(T ) belong to [A1A2]. If T / Br(y(W1)) then the neighbourhood of y(W1) cannot be covered by  . Indeed, consider y(T ) with the smallest distance from y(W1). Then   Int (y(T )T V W1y(W1)) = , which implies that ]y(W1)y(T )[ is not covered by  , so y(W1) = y(T ).
Recall that Br(A1)   = , and consider an arbitrary point Z  Br(A1)   . Note that [ZT ]  [T V ]  C covers M  S, so T , Z, A1 lie on the same line. Denote T A1y(W1) by , T y(W1)A1 by  and W1y(W1)A2 by . Since T , Z, A1 are collinear, A1T y(W1) = y(W1)T V =  -  - . Sum of the angles in quadrilateral y(W1)W1V T gives that

2 2 = y(W1) + W1 + V + T = ( -  - ) + ( - ) + 3 + ( -  - ), so
5  + 2 + 2 = .

so

Then

consider

the

angles

in quadrilateral T V W1y(W1): T , W1 are at least /2, y(W1) > /2 + or(1) and V = 2/3, which gives sum strictly

greater than 2.

Finally T may be a point of degree 1. This means that T  Br(A1)  Br(W1). Note that A1T y(W1) + y(W1)T V  

otherwise one can replace [V T ] with [V T ], where T := [A1V ]  Br(A1) this replacement does not change the energy and decreases the length of  .

Denote C1y(W1)W1 by  and y(W1)T V by . Consider the sum of angles in quadrilateral W1V T y(W1):

so 4 = 2/3 + 2A1. Recall that A1T W1 + W1T V  , it implies
 4 - 2 -

+   ,

so   2A1 - 2/3 < /2 since A1 < 7/12. From the other hand Br(y(W1))   = , hence   /2; contradiction.

5 Application of computational methods
In this section M is a rectangle A1 . . . A4. Define the following orthogonal coordinate system: A1 is the origin point, [A1, A2) is the X-axis, and [A1, A4) is the Y -axis.
Note that the intersections   li,i+1 are segments, parallel to AiAi+1. Otherwise reflect a part   j of minimal length from perpendicular bisectors to the sides of M ; denote the resulting set by . The set  is obtained by connecting the components of  by segments, parallel to AiAi+1. By the choice of j the length of   (i) is at most H1(  (i)) so H1   li,i+1  H1   li,i+1 which implies the desired condition.
Lemma 5.1. Let W1, W2 be defined as in Lemma 4.7. (Recall that by Lemma 4.5 y(W1) and y(W2) are defined uniquely.) Then
Br(y(W1))  Br(y(W2)) = .
Proof. Let Q   be a point that covers A1, hence |QA1|  r. From the other hand Br(y(W1))   = Br(y(W2))   = , so |y(W1)Q|, |y(W2)Q|  r. Then y(W1)A1Q  A1y(W1)Q, y(W2)A1Q  A1y(W2)Q. Consider the sum of angles in quadrilateral A1y(W1)Qy(W2):
2 = A1 +y(W1)+y(W2)+Q = y(W1)A1Q+y(W2)A1Q+A1y(W1)Q+A2y(W2)Q+Q  2A1 +Q =  +Q.
So Q  . If Q =  then Br(y(W1)), Br(y(W2)) are tangent, which implies the conclusion of lemma. Otherwise Q > , which implies that Q lies inside triangle A1y(W1)y(W2). Suppose the contrary, i.e. Br(y(W1)) 
Br(y(W2)) = . Then  cannot intersect the side [y(W1)y(W2)] of triangle A1y(W1)y(W2). Since   N we got a contradiction.

x := dist (A1, y(W1)),

where

C(p) = |Z1(p)W1(p)| + |W1(p)V (p)| + |V (p)W2(p)| + |W2(p)Z2(p)|,

Consider a box P (c, ). First, if there is at least one obtainable point in the box, i.e. p = p( )  P (c, ) for some minimizer  , then Br(y(W1)(p))  Br(y(W2)(p)) =  should hold by Lemma 5.1. By the Pythagorean theorem for the triangle A1y(W1)(p)y(W2)(p) we conclude that if
(xc + x)2 + (yc + y)2 < 4r2,
then all p  P (c, ) are unobtainable. Second, there is no need to consider P (c, )  P0, i.e. P (c, ) which satisfies

Suppose that neither of two conditions above hold. Then we obtain the lower bound on L(c) in the following way: we calculate the coordinates of the points Z1(c), W1(c), V (c), W2(c), Z2(c) and evaluate C(c) explicitly; we use Melzak's algorithm [10] to get the lower bound on H1(St(c)).
Now, there exists a function Err(c, ) such that L(p)  L(c) - Err(c, ) holds for any p  P (c, ); we show how to obtain Err in Subsection 5.1.

15

If L(c) - Err(c, )  L0, then L(p)  L0 for any p  P (c, ). Otherwise, we split P (c, ) into 26 boxes by dividing each of its sides into two equal halves, and consider each of these boxes in the same way.
When checking inequalities, we take into account the numerical errors by using C-XSC interval arithmetic package [7], [9]. In some cases, we are unable to check some of the inequalities in the reconstruction phase of the Melzak's algorithm; in these cases we assume that the reconstruction phase is successful. That means that our implementation of the Melzak's algorithm can sometimes return value smaller than the length of a Steiner tree on given points; this is of no consequence since we are only interested in the lower bound on this length.
Each considered box is treated as a separate task; these tasks are run in parallel. The search has finished in approximately 50 hours of real time (350 hours of total CPU time) on a 2.3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5 processor. The source code can be found at [6].

5.1 Error estimation
We want to obtain the inequality of the form
for any p  P (c, ). By the definition of L,

L(p)  L(c) - Err(c, )

L(c) - L(p)  C(c) - C(p) + |H1(St(c)) - H1(St(p))|.

When a terminal of a Steiner tree shifts by a vector of length no more than , the length of a tree changes by at most  (note that the topology of a Steiner tree may change). Using this fact, we get

|H1(St(c))-H1(St(p))|  |V (c)-V (p)|+|Q1(c)-Q1(p)|+|Q2(c)-Q2(p)|+|Q(c)-Q(p)|  |V (c)-V (p)|+(1 +2 +)r.

Denote p = (x, y, , 1, 2, ),  = (p) =

11 12

-

.

For brevity, we are going to omit the arguments and write V

instead of

V (p) (and so on). We have

W1 = (x + r cos , r sin ), W2 = (r sin , y + r cos ).

So

4

|Z1W1| =

 + 4 r - x - r cos , 6

4

|W2Z2| =

 + 4 r - y - r cos . 6

Since V is the intersection point of (W1V ) and (W2V ) we have

V = W1 + l1 · (cos 2, sin 2) = W2 + l2 · (sin 2, cos 2)

(2)

for some l1 and l2 (in fact, l1 = |W1V | and l2 = |W2V |). The solution of system (2) is

x cos 2 + y sin 2 + r cos( + 2) + r sin 

y cos 2 + x sin 2 + r cos(2 + ) + r sin 

l1 = -

that

6 The case p  P0
Let p  P0; consider the Steiner tree St(p). Recall than St(p) connects points Q1  Br(y(W1)), Q2  Br(y(W2)), Q  Br(A1) and V , so by definition St(p) has at most 4 distinct terminals. In this section we consider possible topologies of St(p).

Case 1. The terminals St(p) on the circumferences Br(y(W1)) and Br(y(W2)) coincide, i.e. Q1 = Q2. Recall that Br(y(W1))  Br(y(W2)) = , so these circumferences are tangent to each other at point Q1. So A1Q1 is a median in right-angled triangle A1y(W1)y(W2) with hypotenuses 2r, so |Q1A1| = r, and hence Q = Q1 = Q2 and St(p) = [V Q]. Recall that Br(y(W1))   = Br(y(W2))   = , hence [V Q] is tangent to both circumferences, so [V Q]  [y(W1)y(W2)].
Point V lies on the perpendicular bisector of y(W1)y(W2), hence |V y(W1)| = |V y(W2)| and QV y(W1) = QV y(W2). Since QV W1 = QV W2 = 2/3 the angles y(W1)V W1 and y(W2)V W2 are also equal. Recall that |y(W1)W1| = |y(W2)W2| = r. So the triangles y(W1)W1V and y(W2)W2V are either equal or y(W1)W1V + y(W2)W2V = , but

y(W1)W1V + y(W2)W2V = ( - ) + ( - ) = 13/12.

Hence

 -  = y(W1)W1V = y(W2)W2V =  + /12,

so  = 11/24 and  (p) = 0. We have to estimate H1(0). Recall that we use the coordinate system defined in Section 5, assume that r = 1. By
definition

11 Z1(p0) = pM (i) + 3, sin 24
 Since x0 = y0 = 2



11 11

W1(p0) =

2 + cos , sin

24

24

 (5.632993, 0.991445)  (1.544740, 0.991445)

11 Z2(p0) = sin 24 , pM (i) + 3  (0.991445, 5.632993).

11 

11

W2(p0) =

sin , 24

2 + cos 24

 (0.991445, 1.544740).

Solving system (2) we have

V (p0)  (1.108370, 1.108370).

Finally, Q(p0) = Q1(p0) = Q2(p0) =

1 , 1
22

 (0.707107, 0.707107).

So

we

have

H1(0)  9.647504.

Since

every

coordinate has error term

1 2

10-6,

a

point

lies in 

1 2

· 10-6-neighborhood

of

its approximation. Then by triangle inequality error of the length of every segment is at most 2 · 10-6. Since 0 consists of

five segments, the total error is at most 5 2 · 10-6 < 8 · 10-6. It implies the inequality

H1(0) > 9.647496.

Case 2. St(p) has a branching point, say T . Then at least one of terminals Q1, Q2 has degree 1, without loss of generality it is Q1. If Q1 is connected with T by a segment of  , then sum of the angles in quadrangle V T y(W1)W1 is equal to

Case 3. St(p) consists of 2 line segments. Since Q1 and Q2 are different, St(p) = [V Q2]  [Q2Q1] (up to Q1 - Q2 symmetry). So Q1  Br(A1) or Q2  Br(A1).
Case 3a. In this case Q1  Br(A1). There is a configuration better than p0; we provide it explicitly (for simplicity r = 1):
Z1 = (5.632993, 0.991394), W1 = (1.545358, 0.991394), V = (1.108083, 1.108927), W2 = (0.991495, 1.545397),
Z2 = (0.991495, 5.632993), Q2 = (0.723714, 0.725155), Q1 = (0.707224, 0.706989), y(W1) = (1.414448, 0), y(W2) = (0, 1.415255).
Explicit calculations show that
0.999999 < |y(W2)W2|, |y(W2)Q2|, |A1Q1|, |Q1y(W1)|, |W1y(W1)| < 1.
Note that W1Z1 is parallel to A1A2 and W2Z2 is parallel to A1A4. So [y(W1)C1] is covered by [W1Z1] and [y(W2)C2] is covered by [W2Z2]. Also [Q1Q2] covers [y(W2)A1] and Q1 covers [A1y(W1)].
The total length  (p) = [Z1W1]  [W1V ]  [V W2]  [W2Z2]  [V Q2]  [Q2Q1] is less than 9.647492 which is smaller than the length of 0, see (6).
The total length of a minimizer is P er - 8 4 + 2 + 1 + 4H1( (p)) - 2r + o(r)  P er - 8.473981. The term 2r + o(r)

is the difference between a solutions of Problem 1.1 and Problem 4.4.

Case 3b. Q2  Br(A1). Then by Proposition 3.3

so

We express the coordinates of points Q2, W1, W2, S as functions of :

Now we can substitute  = 0 +  into all the expressions above and treat each of these expressions as a function of . We bound each of these functions in   [-1/30, 1/30] from below and from above by two 6th order polynomials. To obtain these polynomials we consider the following functions:

We bound each of these functions by 6th order polynomials from below and from above, using Taylor approximation series with the Lagrange form of the remainder. Note that 6th order derivative of each of these functions does not change sign and is monotonous on the corresponding value interval of x + c. It means that in each case the remainder can be bound by zero from one side, and by f (6)(z) · x6/6! on the other side, where z is one of the endpoints of the value interval of x + c.
Now suppose we want to estimate f (g()), where

q1(x, c)  f (x + c)  q2(x, c), Lc < c < Rc, L < x + c < R, is one of the functions above, and function g is already estimated:

p1()  g()  p2().

We split polynomials p1, p2 into non-constant and constant parts:

pi() = pi () + ci, where pi (0) = 0.

If the inequalities

Lc < ci < Rc,

L < p1()  p2() < R for

30 30

hold, then (assuming that f is increasing, otherwise p1, c1 and p2, c2 should be swapped)

q1(p1(), c1)  f (g())  q2(p2(), c2).

We have bounded f (g()) by 36th order polynomials. To obtain bounds by 6th order polynomials, we loose these bounds,

using inequalities of the form

p1()  f ()  p2(); q1()  g()  q2(),

p1() - q2()  f () - g()  p2() - q1(). Additionally, if p1()  0, q1()  0, then

p1() · q1()  f () · g()  p2() · q2().
The obtained bounds in the latter case are polynomials of degree 12, we replace them by 6th order polynomials using (11). When checking the inequalities of the form

L < p1()  p2() < R for  

11 -,

,

we reduce the degrees of p1, p2 from 6 to 2, using inequalities similar to (11), and find extremal values of 2nd order polynomials explicitly.
Finally, we obtain polynomial bounds

s2().

Since the conditions (i), (ii) should hold, the following conditions should also hold:

r2() > 0, s2()  0.

Once again, we loose these conditions by replacing r2 and s2 with 2nd order polynomials, and solve the obtained inequalities explicitly.
The first inequality is satisfied only if 1
  - , -0.004 ; 30

the second inequality is satisfied only if

1   -0.0008, .

Case 5. St(p) consists of three line segments [V Q2], [Q2Q] and [QQ1] (up to Q1-Q2 symmetry). By Proposition 3.3

2 cos2  = cos Qy(W1)A1,

so

Qy(W1)A1

=

arccos(2 cos2 )

>

for p  P0 (here we need a weaker bound than in Case 3b).

From

other

hand

so

Summing

up

we

have

that

Qy(W1)A1

> QA1y(W1),

so

|Qy(W1)| < |QA1| = r which is a contradiction.

7 Conclusion

Now we briefly enlist related open problems. The most interesting is to find the set of minimizers for a circumference. Miranda,

Paolini and Stepanov conjectured that an arbitrary minimizer for a circumference of radius R > r is a horseshoe. It is also

interesting to find a set of minimizers for long enough stadium.

It make sense to determine how strong Theorem 2.2 can be. The condition R > 5r seems excessive; for R < 1.75r the

statement is false. For details see [3].

Here we focus on the uniqueness of a minimizer (up to symmetries) for a rectangle. Recall that the topology of the Case

3a

leads

to

a

minimizer

(see

Fig.

The second and the forth equations are applications of Proposition 3.3 to points y(W2) and y(W1) respectively (we do not enlist case, corresponding to right-hand side of the fourth equation in Section 3, but it can be found in [3]). The fifth and the sixth equations are projection of quadrangle Q1Q2V W1 on sides Q1W1 and V W1.

Computer simulation shows that the length has unique minimum for p  P0 with respect to the system. But a computerassistant proof of this fact is too ugly to write it here.
