CONVOLUTORS OF TRANSLATION-MODULATION INVARIANT BANACH SPACES OF ULTRADISTRIBUTIONS
LENNY NEYT
Abstract. We study the space of tempered ultradistributions whose convolutions with test functions are all contained in a given translation-modulation invariant Banach space of ultradistributions. Our main result will be the first structural theorem for the aforementioned space. As an application we consider several extensions of convolution.
1. Introduction
Convolution constitutes as one of the most important tools in mathematical analysis. In the theory of generalized functions it has been an extensively studied subject going back to Schwartz's work [42], where new results are still found until this day [1, 18, 34, 35, 36, 44]. When looking at the theory of ultradistributions, a considerable amount of literature can be found on the existence of convolution in both the non-quasianalytic case [16, 30, 37, 38] and the quasianalytic case [19, 39]. The scope of this article is situated in the theory of the Gelfand-Shilov spaces and their duals the tempered ultradistributions [26]. More specifically our main goal is to characterize when the convolution of a tempered ultradistribution with a test function is contained in a socalled translation-modulation invariant Banach space of ultradistribution (in short: TMIB) in the sense of [17]. These spaces find their origin in harmonic analysis, offering a natural extension for several classes appearing there. Well-known examples of TMIB are the weighted Lp-spaces, modulation spaces [21, 22, 23, 24] and their generalizations [11, 17], and Wiener amalgam spaces [20, 25].
We now give an overview of the content of this text. In the preliminary Sections 2 and 3 we define and study weight sequences, the Pettis integral, and weighted vector-valued continuous functions. Then, in Section 4, we formally introduce the Gelfand-Shilov spaces of Beurling and Roumieu type, here commonly denoted by S[[AM] ] = S[[AM] ](Rd). In particular we consider convolution in their context and specifically show that the convolutions  : S[[AM] ] × S[[AM] ]  S[[AM] ] and  : S[A[M] ] × S[[AM] ]  S[A[M] ] are well-defined and (hypo-)continuous, but moreover may be seen as Pettis integrals, allowing us to employ a uniform definition of convolution for spaces in between S[[AM] ] and S[A[M] ].
In Section 5 we consider the TMIB. A Banach space E is a TMIB if it is closed under translation and modulation, where the norms of these operations have certain

bounds (see (5.1)), and such that the dense inclusions S[[AM] ]  E  S[A[M] ] hold. In this paper we will also consider the case where this last condition is relaxed to just having the continuous inclusion E  S[A[M] ], and we will then call E a weak TMIB (in short: wTMIB). Note that any dual of a TMIB (in short: DTMIB) is a wTMIB. Then to any wTMIB E we can associate the space DE[M] of those tempered ultradistributions whose derivatives are all elements of E and such that the norms of those derivatives
are bounded by the weight sequence M. Section 5 mainly deals with the study of the structural and topological properties of DE[M].
The primary focus of this text are the convolutor spaces OC (S[[AM]], E) of those f  S[A[M] ] such that f    E for every   S[[AM] ] for some TMIB E. In Section 6 we consider the topological and structural properties of OC (S[[AM]], E). In particular, our main goal is to prove the ensuing first structural theorem; all unexplained notions are
defined in Sections 2, 4, and 5.

Theorem 1.1. Let M and A be two weight sequences satisfying (M.1) and (M.2), and let E be a TMIB of class [M ] - [A] satisfying (5.4). Then, for any f  S[A[M] ](Rd),

(1.1)

  S[[AM] ](Rd),

if and only if there exist f  E,   Nd, such that

(1.2)

f=

Nd

and for some  > 0 (for every  > 0) we have that

(1.3)

sup ||M f E < .
Nd

Note that due to the relatively weak conditions on the weight sequences one cannot
use the parametrix method [31], as is commonly done in the literature. As a result,
a novel approach is needed. In the special case where E = C0, the space of continuous functions vanishing at infinity, Theorem 1.1 was already shown in [9] (as well as
weighted variants) by Debrouwere, the author, and Vindas. In their proof an abstract
criterion for the surjectivity of a continuous linear mapping in terms of its transpose
(cfr. [9, Lemma 1], see also Lemma 6.8) was combined together with the computation of the dual of B, the space of ultradistributions vanishing at infinity. The latter was
done by exploiting the mapping properties of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
[27]. Here we extend the technique to its full potential in order to prove Theorem 1.1. In particular, we will show that DE[M ] can be seen as the dual of OC (S[[AM] ], E) by use of the so-called desingularization formula of the STFT. It is interesting to note that
the STFT has recently shown itself to be a powerful tool in studying the structure and
topological invariants of (generalized) function spaces, and it will take up a central role
in this text as well; for other examples we refer the reader to [2, 8, 9, 14, 15, 28]. In Section 7 we consider the case of a DTMIB E. For instance, we show that
OC (S[[AM] ], E) is the strong dual of DE[M]. This allows one, by more classical means

via the Hahn-Banach theorem, to establish an analog of Theorem 1.1 in the case of a DTMIB in the form of Theorem 7.4. Moreover, as S[[AM]] is contained by but not necessarily dense in E, we also consider its closure in E, which we denote by E  and is a TMIB. In Theorem 7.5 we show that OC (S[[AM] ], E ) is exactly the closure of S[[AM] ]
in OC (S[[AM] ], E). This generalizes the special case where E = L1 and we find E = L and E  = C0, showing the equivalent definition of B as the convolutor space of C0 and as the closure of S[[AM]] in B[M], the space of bounded ultradistributions.
Finally, in Section 8, we use the structure established in Theorem 1.1 in order to
define three extensions of convolution. In Theorem 8.2 we show that the convolutions of elements of OC (S[[AM]], E) with test functions is actually contained in DE[M] and moreover the space of test functions may be enlarged. For example, we see that the convolution  : B[M] × DL[M1 ]  B[M] holds, with B[M] = DC[M0 ] the space of ultradifferentiable functions vanishing at infinity. Theorem 8.3 then looks at the transpose of the previous result, defining the convolution between OC (S[[AM] ], E) and OC (S[[AM] ], E). In the last extension, Theorem 8.5, we consider a direct definition of convolution between two types of convolutor spaces. A particular example is the convolution  : B[M] × DL[M1 ]  B[M], where DL[M1 ] = OC (S[[AM] ], L1) is the convolutor space of L1.

2. Preliminaries
We review two preliminary subjects which will be used throughout this text. First, we consider weight sequences through which we define our spaces of ultradifferentiable functions and ultradistributions in the sense of Komatsu [31]. Second, we discuss vector-valued integration in the form of Pettis integrals specific to our context, which will allow us to uniformly extend operations such as convolution to several spaces.

2.1. Weight sequences. A sequence M = (Mp)pN of positive real numbers is called a weight sequence if limp(Mp/M0)1/p = . We will often assume one or more of the
following conditions on a weight sequence M:

(M.1): Mp2  Mp-1Mp+1, p  1;

(M.2): Mp+1  C0HpMp for some C0, H  1;

(M.2): Mp+q  C0Hp+qMpMq for some C0, H  1;

(M.3):

 p=1

Mp-1/Mp

<

.

We refer the reader to [31] for the meaning of these conditions. For any two weight
sequences M and N we write M  N if there are C, L > 0 such that Mp  CLpNp for all p  N. Also, for a multi-index   Nd, we simply write M = M||. Well-known examples are the Gevrey sequences MG,s = (p!s)pN, s > 0, which always satisfy (M.1) and (M.2), while (M.3) is valid if and only if s > 1.

The associated function of a weight sequence M is defined as

M (t)

=

sup
pN

log

tpM0 Mp

,

t > 0,

4

L. NEYT

and M (0) = 0. We define M on Rd as the radial function M (x) = M (|x|), x  Rd. Then, M is a non-negative continuous function on Rd which vanishes in a neigborhood of the origin.
We will always assume a weight sequence M satisfies (M.1) and (M.2). Consequently, the associated function enjoys the following properties:
· For any x, y  Rd we have [5, Lemma 2.1.3]

(2.1)

M (x + y)  M (2x) + M (2y).

· For any k > 0 we have the following bound [31, Proposition 3.4],

t > 0.

In particular, we have that, for any q > 0, eM (q·)/eM (qHd+1·)  L1, a fact we will often use throughout this text.

2.2. Pettis integrals. Let E be a lcHs (= locally convex Hausdorff space) and denote by csn(E) the set of all continuous seminorms on E. A function f : Rd  E is called weakly integrable if   f  L1 for any   E, and if there exists an e  E such that

, e = , f (x) dx,
Rd

  E,

we call e the Pettis integral of f and we write e = Rd f dµ. Note that the Pettis integral is unique and linear if it exists. If F is another lcHs and A : E  F is a continuous
linear map, then A(f ) is also weakly integrable, and if f has a Pettis integral so does
A(f ) with

(2.3)

A f dµ = A(f )dµ.

Rd

Rd

In particular, if E is continuously embedded in F , and f is weakly integrable with Pettis

integral in E, then it is also weakly integrable in F with the same Pettis integral. For any function f : Rd  E, it suffices that p  f  L1 for any p  csn(E) in order
for f to be weakly integrable. Moreover, if E is complete and f is continuous, this also

guarantees the existence of the Pettis integral.

Lemma 2.1. Let E be a complete lcHs and f : Rd  E be continuous. If p  f  L1 for any p  csn(E), then the Pettis integral of f exists. Moreover, we have

(2.4)

p

f dµ  p(f )dµ,

Rd

Rd

p  csn(E).

Proof. We first note that should the Pettis integral of f exists, then (2.4) follows immediately from the bipolar theorem and (2.3). Let  be a continuous function on Rd so that 0    1, (x) = 1 for |x|  1, and (x) = 0 for |x| > 2. Now, for any R > 0 put R = (·/R) and write fR = R · f . Then fR is a continuous function Rd  E with compact support, whence its Pettis integral exists (by [41, Theorem 3.27] combined with the corollary after [43, Proposition 7.11]). By (2.4) we see that p( Rd fS - fRdµ)  |x|>R p(f )dµ for any 0 < R < S and p  csn(E), from which it

follows that ( Rd fRdµ)R>0 is a Cauchy net and thus converges to some e  E. As | , fR(x) |  | , f (x) | for any x  Rd, R > 0, and   E, it follows from (2.3) and
the dominated convergence theorem that

, e

= lim , R

fRdµ
Rd

= lim R

, fR dµ =
Rd

, f dµ,
Rd

for all   E. We may thus conclude that e is the Pettis integral of f .

As a corollary of Lemma 2.1, we may now state the dominated convergence theorem for Pettis integrals.

Lemma 2.2. Let E be a complete lcHs and fn : Rd  E be a sequence of continuous
weakly integrable functions that converge pointwisely almost everywhere to a continuous function f : Rd  E. Suppose that for every p  csn(E) there is a function gp  L1 such that p(fn)  gp for every n  N almost everywhere. Then, f is weakly integrable
with Pettis integral and

f dµ = lim

Rd

n

fndµ.
Rd

Proof. If fn  f pointwise almost everywhere, then specifically p(f )  p(fn) pointwise almost everywhere for any p  csn(E). Hence, by applying the scalar dominated convergence theorem we see that p(f )  L1 for any p  csn(E). Lemma 2.1 then shows
that f is weakly integrable with Pettis integral. Additionally, as p(f -fn)  2gp almost everywhere for any p  csn(E), we see by another application of the scalar dominated
convergence theorem that Rd p(f - fn)dµ  0. Also note that every fn has a Pettis integral by Lemma 2.1. Hence, by (2.4), we find that Rd f dµ = limn Rd fndµ.

3. Weighted vector-valued continuous functions

We now introduce spaces of vector-valued continuous functions weighted with respect to the associated function of some weight sequence. These may be thought of as frequency spaces, which will characterize the spaces we are interested in via the STFT. As a result, many properties of the frequency spaces are reflected in the associated spaces.
Let E be a lcHs and let w : Rd  (0, ) be a continuous function. We define Cw(E) as the lcHs of all continuous functions  : Rd  E such that

sup w()p(()) < ,
Rd

p  csn(E).

With respect to a weight sequence M, we then define the spaces

C(M)(E) = lim- CeM (q·)(E), C{M}(E) = -lim CeM (q·)(E),

q

q0+

and

C(M),d(E) = -lim Ce-M (q·) (E), C{M},d(E) = lim- Ce-M (q·) (E).

q

q0+

We will use C[M](E) as a common notation for C(M)(E) and C{M}(E), where the former is called of Beurling type and the latter of Roumieu type. In addition, we shall

6

L. NEYT

often first state assertions for C(M)(E) followed in parenthesis by the corresponding statements for C{M}(E). Similar conventions will be used for C[M],d(E) and other spaces and notations. In the special case where E = Rd, we will simply write C[M] = C[M](Rd).
Topologically, the spaces we consider have the ensuing structure.

Lemma 3.1. (i) If E is a Fr´echet space, then, C(M)(E) and C{M},d(E) are Fr´echet spaces. Moreover, if E is a Banach space, the spaces are quasinormable.
(ii) If E = -limn En is a compactly regular (LB)-space, then, C{M}(E) and C(M),d(E) are complete and thus regular (LB)-spaces, and moreover we have

C{M}(E) = -lim CeM (·/n)(En) and C(M),d(E) = -lim Ce-M (n·) (En).

Proof. (i) We show the statement for C(M)(E), the case of C{M},d(E) is analogous. Clearly C(M)(E) is a Fr´echet space. Now suppose E is a Banach space. To show that C(M)(E) is quasinormable, it suffices to verify that [33, Lemma 26.14]

q > 0 r > 0   (0, 1] R > 0   C(M)(E) with   1 CeM (2log Hq·)(E)   C(M)(E) with  CeM (r·) (E)  R such that  -   . CeM (q·) (E)
Take any q > 0. For any   (0, 1] we set  = - log2  and choose any continuous function  : Rd  [0, 1] such that () = 1 for ||  C0e/q and () = 0 for ||  C0e/q + 1. For any   C(M)(E) with  CeM (2log Hq·)(E)  1 we put  =  · . Then, for arbitrary r > 0,

(ii) We again only consider the statement for C{M}(E), the case of C(M),d(E) is done analogously. C{M}(E) is complete by [3, Corollary 3.3] and the remark following it shows that

C{M } (E )

Then -limn CeM(·/n)(En) is continuously contained in C{M}(E) and even more the spaces coincide as sets. By De Wilde's open mapping theorem it now follows that the spaces coincide topologically as well.

The duality relation between the spaces C[M](E) and C[M],d(E) is explored in the next result.

Lemma 3.2. Let E be a Fr´echet space (a compactly regular (LB)-space), F be a
compactly regular (LB)-space (a Fr´echet space), G be a complete lcHs, and let { :   Rd} be a subset of L(G, G) such that

p0  csn(G) p1  csn(G) q0 > 0 q1 > 0 (q1 > 0 q0 > 0) C > 0 g  G :

(3.1)

p0(g)eM (q0)  Cp1(g)eM (q1).

Consider a hypocontinuous bilinear map A : E × F  G. Then,

(3.2)

C[M](E) × C[M],d(F )  G : (E, F )  A(E(), F (-))d,
Rd

is a well-defined hypocontinuous bilinear map, where the integral in (3.2) is a Pettis integral.

Proof. As both C[M](E) and C[M],d(F ) are barreled, it suffices to show that the mapping in (3.2) is separately continuous. Fix any p0  csn(G) and let p1  csn(G) be as in (3.1). Take any F  C[M],d(F ). Then, for some q0 > 0 (for all q0 > 0) we have supRd e-M(q0)p(F (-)) <  for any p  csn(F ). Consequently, {F (-)e-M (q0) :   Rd} is a bounded set in F , so that {A(·, F (-))e-M (q0) :   Rd} is an equicontinuous subset of L(E, G). In particular, there is some p2  csn(E) such that for some C > 0,

p1(A(x, F (-)))  Cp2(x)eM (q0),

x  E,   Rd.

By (3.1), for any q1 > 0 there is a q2 > 0 (for any q2 > 0 there is a q1 > 0) such that for some C > 0,

p0(g)e-M (q2)  Cp1(g)e-M (q1),

g  G,   Rd.

Take any E  C[M](E). Then E  CeM(q2·)(E), where in the Roumieu case q2 > 0 is fixed with respect to E. It follows that

In the Beurling case we choose q1 = Hd+1q0 and let q2 be determined by (3.1), in the Roumieu case we let q1 be determined by (3.1) and choose q0 = H-d-1q1. In particular, in both cases we have that eM(q0·)/eM(q1·)  L1. Consequently, we get for
some C > 0,

p0(A(E(), F (-)))d  Cp2(E())eM (q2).

By Lemma 2.1, this not only shows that the Pettis integral in (3.2) exists, but also the continuity of the mapping in the first variable. Analogously, one shows the continuity in the second variable, from which the result follows.
We end this section with two density results.

Lemma 3.3. Let E, F be Fr´echet spaces (compactly regular (LB)-spaces) such that E is dense in F . Then, C[M](E) is dense in C[M](F ).

Proof. Clearly, for the Beurling case,

C(M)E = lim- C  E eM (q·)  = lim- CeM (q·)(E) = C[M](E),

q

q

and analogously C(M)(F ) = C(M)F . Similarly, we have in the Roumieu case C{M}(E) = C{M}E and C{M}(F ) = C{M}F by [3, Corollary 3.3]. As C[M]E is dense in C[M]F , our proof is complete.

Lemma 3.4. Let E be a lcHs. Then, C[M](E) is dense in C[M],d(E).

Proof. In virtue of (2.2), one sees that the space of continuous functions Rd  E with compact support is dense in both C[M](E) and C[M],d(E).

4. Gelfand-Shilov spaces and their duals: definition, convolution, and the short-time Fourier transform

We introduce the Gelfand-Shilov spaces and their duals, and consider convolution in this context. In particular we will show that the classical definition of convolution between Gelfand-Shilov spaces coincides with the vector-valued definition using Pettis integrals. The advantage of this is that in the sequel any definition of convolution using Pettis integrals is an automatic extension of that for Gelfand-Shilov spaces. As a special case we also consider the short-time Fourier transform. Throughout this section, we will work with two weight sequences M and A which both satisfy (M.1) and (M.2).

4.1. The Gelfand-Shilov spaces. For any q,  > 0 we define SAM,q, = SAM,q,(Rd) as the Banach space of all   C(Rd) such that



SAM,q,

=

sup
(,x)Nd ×Rd

|()(x)|eA(qx) ||M

< .

Then, we define the Gelfand-Shilov spaces (of Beurling and Roumieu type)

S((AM)) =

lim-

S M, A,-1

,

0+

S{{AM}}

=

-lim

S M, A,-1

.



S((AM)) is a (F N )-space, while S{{AM}} is a (DF N )-space [10, Theorem 1.1]. In particular, S{{AM}} is compactly regular.
Throughout this text, we will always assume that the space S((AM)) is non-trivial. A sufficient condition for this is MG,s  M and MG,r  A for some r, s > 0 with r + s > 1
[26, p. 235]. Other non-triviality conditions can be found in [13].
A useful property we will often apply is the equivalent definition of the GelfandShilov spaces by use of L1-norms. For any measurable function  : Rd  (0, ) for which  and -1 are locally bounded, we denote by L1 = L1(Rd) the Banach space of all functions  : Rd  C such that  L1 = Rd |(x)|(x)dx < . For arbitrary

q,  > 0, we now define SAM,1,,q = SAM,1,,q(Rd) as the Banach space of all   C(Rd) such that

Then, we have as locally convex spaces [10, Theorem 1.2],

We denote by D[M] = D[M](Rd) the space of compactly supported ultradifferentiable
functions endowed with its natural locally convex topology, see [31]. This space is nontrivial if and only if M satisfies (M.3) [31, Theorem 4.2]. Its strong dual is denoted by D[M], also called the space of ultradistributions.
We denote the translation and modulation operators by Txf (t) = f (t - x) and Mf (t) = e2i·tf (t) for x,   Rd. Also, we write f(t) = f (-t) for reflection about the origin. Note that the space S[[AM]], and by transposition its dual space S[A[M] ], is closed under these operations.
The convolution between two functions f  L and g  L1 is defined as

f  g(t) = g(x)f (t - x)dx.
Rd

In view of (4.1), it follows that the convolution between two elements of S[[AM]] is well-

defined.

Proof. For the proof of (4.3), we follow a similar approach as that of [19, Lemma
3.7], however more direct and with a somewhat different construction so that only the condition (M.2) is needed (instead of (M.2)). For any m, n  1 we denote Dm,n =

From here we may conclude

Indeed, in the Roumieu case this follows directly, while in the Beurling case this

Finally, the continuity is a direct consequence of (4.2) in view of (4.1).

The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) of a function   S[[AM]] with respect to a window   S[[AM] ] is given by1
V() = (M-)    S[[AM] ].
The adjoint STFT of a function   C[M](S[[AM] ]) with respect to a window   S[[AM] ] is defined by the Pettis integral

V = M[()  ]d. Rd

Proposition 4.2. Take 0, 1,   S((AM)) and write  = 0  1. The linear mappings

V : S[[AM] ]  C[M](S[[AM] ]) and V : C[M](S[[AM] ])  S[[AM] ],

are well-defined and continuous. Moreover, if (, )L2 = 0, then,

In view of (4.1), it follows that V : S[[AM] ]  C[M](S[[AM] ]) is a well-defined continuous linear map.
Next, we treat V. Suppose   S((AM)) and take any   SAM,2,//2 for arbitrary  > 0.

for

(for

In

particular,

{()eM (4Hd+1/)

  B,   Rd} is a bounded set in S[[AM]]. Consequently, we find the constant C =

possibly raise . We get

M[()  ] SAM,,1/  C

By (2.4) it follows that {V :   B} is a bounded subset of S[[AM] ]. As C[M](S[[AM] ]) is
bornological, we may conclude that V : C[M](S[[AM] ])  S[[AM] ] is a well-defined continuous linear map.
Finally, we note that (4.5) holds, since S[[AM]] is a subspace of L2(Rd) [10, Theorem
1.2] and the identity is valid there [27, Corollary 3.2.3].

In view of the condition that the window  has to be exactly the convolution of two elements in S((AM)), we demonstrate that one may always choose a  that enjoys nice properties for our purposes.

Lemma 4.3. There exist 0,   S((AM)) such that  = 0  0 and (, )L2 = 1.

14

L. NEYT

Proof. Take any   S((AM)) such that (0) = 0. We may assume that  is even, as otherwise we could just take  ·   S((AM)). Now set  =     S[[AM] ] and note that (0) = Rd |(t)|2dt = 0. Put  = (, )L2 > 0. Choosing 0 = -1/4, then  = 0  0 will have the desired properties.

4.2. The tempered ultradistributions. We denote S[A[M] ] for the strong dual of the
Gelfand-Shilov space S[[AM]], also called the space of tempered ultradistributions (of Beurl-
ing and Roumieu type). Then, S((AM) ) is a (DF N )-space, while S{{AM} } is a (F N )-space. For any  > 0, we will often use the following spaces

(4.6)

X = S , (M )SAM,,-1

()

(A)

Then, as locally convex spaces,

X{}

=

S M, A,-1

.

S((AM) ) = l-im X(), 

S{{AM} } = lim- X{}. 

We define the convolution of a tempered ultradistribution f  S[A[M] ] and a test function   S[[AM]] by transposition, i.e.,

f  ,  = f,    ,

  S[[AM] ].

Alternatively, we may express f   as a Pettis integral.

Lemma 4.4. For any f  S[A[M] ] and   S[[AM] ], we have that

(4.7)

f   = (x)Txf dx,
Rd

where the right-hand side is a Pettis integral. In particular, the convolution map

(4.8)

 : S[A[M] ] × S[[AM] ]  S[A[M] ] : (f, ) 

(x)Txf dx

Rd

is a well-defined hypocontinuous bilinear map.

Proof. The hypocontinuity of (4.8) follows directly from that of (4.4). Now, let X[] be

as in (4.6), then f  X[0] for some 0 > 0 (for any 0 > 0). Note that for any   S[[AM] ] we have (x)Txf,  = f, (-x)T-x . Suppose B is a bounded subset of S[[AM]], then

in particular B is contained and bounded in any (in some) X[]. Consequently, we may

assume the set B = {T-x/eA(-2x/0) :   B, x  Rd} is bounded in X[0] and that

By Lemma 2.1 we may now conclude that the Pettis integral Rd (x)Txf dx exists. Also, by applying (2.3) twice, we see that for any   S[[AM]],

(x)Txf dx,  = (x)Txf,  dx = f, (-x)T-x dx = f,    .

Rd

Rd

By the Pettis integral representation, we see that the convolution (4.8) is the (unique) extension of the convolution (4.4). In particular, we may now extend the (adjoint) STFT to the tempered ultradistributions. For any f  S[A[M] ] we define the STFT with respect to the window   S[[AM] ] as
Vf () = (M-f )    S[A[M] ].
The adjoint STFT of a function   C[M],d(S[A[M] ]) with respect to a window   S[[AM] ] is defined by the Pettis integral

V = M[()  ]d. Rd

Proposition 4.5. Take , 0, 1  S((AM)) and put  = 0  1. The linear mappings

V : S[A[M] ]  C[M],d(S[A[M] ]) and V : C[M],d(S[A[M] ])  S[A[M] ],

are well-defined and continuous. Moreover, if (, )L2 = 0, then,

Proof. We first show the continuity of V. Take any f  S[A[M] ]. Let X[] be as in (4.6),

then for some 0 > 0 (for any 0 > 0) f is an element X[0]. Now, take any bounded

subset B of S[[AM]]. Then, for any 1 > 0 (for some 1 > 0), B is a bounded subset of

for C = CBM0  . SAM,1,2,1//q1 The continuity of V now follows. Next, we consider the continuity of V. Note that for any f  S[A[M] ] and   S[[AM] ]
M[f  ],  = f, (M)   = f, V(-) .
As a result of Lemma 3.2 and Proposition 4.2, we find the following well-defined hypocontinuous bilinear map,

S[[AM] ] × C[M],d(S[A[M] ])  C : (, ) 

(), V(-) d.

Rd

Then, the righthand side will exactly be V,  , so that V is indeed an element of S[A[M] ]. Moreover, for any bounded subset B  C[M],d(S[A[M] ]), the set {V :   B} is
an equicontinuous subset of S[A[M] ], and thus bounded. As C[M],d(S[A[M] ]) is bornological, the continuity of V follows.
Now, suppose (, )L2 = 0. As S[[AM] ]  L2(Rd)  S[A[M] ] and S[[AM] ] is dense in S[A[M] ], it follows that L2(Rd) is dense in S[A[M] ]. Then (4.9) follows directly from [27, Corollary 3.2.3]. By Lemma 3.2, for any   S[[AM]], the linear map

f  Vf (), V(-) d,
Rd
is continuous over S[A[M] ]. Again, by the density of L2(Rd) in S[A[M] ], it follows from [27, Theorem 3.2.1] that the mapping above coincides with the evaluation in . Hence (4.10) holds.

5. Translation-Modulation invariant Banach spaces and the space DE[M]
We now introduce the class of Banach spaces of tempered ultradistributions that are invariant under translation and modulation, which will form the primary building blocks for the theory to come. Throughout this section M and A denote two weight sequences both satisfying (M.1) and (M.2).
Definition 5.1. A Banach space E is called a translation-modulation invariant Banach space of ultradistributions (in short: TMIB) of class [M]-[A] if it satisfies the following three conditions:
(a) the continuous and dense inclusions S[[AM] ]  E  S[A[M] ] hold; (b) Tx(E)  E and M(E)  E for all x,   Rd. (c) there exist , CE, > 0 (for every  > 0 there exists a CE, > 0) such that
(5.1) E (x) := Tx L(E)  CE, eA(x) and E() := M- L(E)  CE, eM ().
If the condition (a) is replaced by the weaker condition: (a) the continuous inclusion E  S[A[M] ] holds;
we call E a weak translation-modulation invariant Banach space of ultradistributions (in short: wTMIB) of class [M] - [A]

CONVOLUTORS OF TRANSLATION-MODULATION INVARIANT BANACH SPACES 17

Remark 5.2. In (5.1) we implicitly use that Tx and M are continuous linear operators on E. This is a direct consequence of (a), (b) and the closed graph theorem, see [19, Lemma 3.1].
Remark 5.3. An example of a wTMIB that is not a TMIB is the space of almost periodic functions [7]. Other direct examples of wTMIB are if we take a TMIB E of class [M] - [A], and then look at its dual E. This space will be a wTMIB of class [M ] - [A], with E(x)  E(-x) and E()  E(). The space E is also called a dual translation-modulation invariant Banach space of ultradistributions (in short: DTMIB) of class [M ] - [A]. A classical example is L. Note that E contains S[[AM]], hence is automatically dense in S[A[M] ]. Consequently, the only possibility for a DTMIB to fail to be a TMIB is in the density of the Gelfand-Shilov space. If E is reflexive, then E is always a TMIB due to the continuous inclusion E  S[A[M] ].
The functions E and E are both positive (since Txf = 0 and Mf = 0 for any f  S[A[M] ] \ {0}) and measurable (cfr. [19, p. 149]). By (5.1) it follows that E and E are locally bounded. On the other hand, let E(x)  CE, eA(x) for some  > 0 and take any e  E such that e E = 1/CE, . Let U be an open ball around the origin on which A is identically zero, then note that the elements of {Tye : y  U} have norm at most 1 in E. For a fixed x0  Rd, we now see that for any x  x0 + U,
E(x) = Tx E  sup TxTye E  Tx0e E . yU
Consequently, we see that E-1 is locally bounded, and similarly one can show that E-1 is locally bounded. Hence, it makes sense to consider the Banach space L1E . A strong property of a wTMIB E is that one may naturally define convolution with elements of L1E on it.
Proposition 5.4. Let E be a wTMIB of class [M] - [A]. The mapping

(5.2)

 : E × L1E  E :

(f, g)  g(x)Txf dx,
Rd

where the righthand side is represented as a Pettis integral, is a well-defined and continuous bilinear mapping, that turns E into a Banach module over L1E , that is,

(5.3)

f  g E  f E g , L1E

f  E, g  L1E .

Proof. We have, for any f  E and g  L1E ,

Rd

g(x)Txf E dx 

|g(x)|E(x) f E dx =
Rd

fE

g , L1E

hence the function is Pettis integrable by Lemma 2.1. From here the continuity and

(5.3) follow directly.

Remark 5.5. The restricted convolution  : E × S[[AM]]  E is extended by the convolution (4.8) in S[A[M] ]. In particular, if f  S[[AM] ]  E and   S[[AM] ], then the definitions of f   as in (4.3) and (5.2) coincide. In the case where E is a TMIB the extension

18

L. NEYT

of the convolution (4.4) is also unique. This was already shown, under the condition (M.2), in [17, Proposition 3.2].

We now consider a particular subspace of a wTMIB E. For any  > 0 we define the Banach space DEM, of all f  S[A[M] ] such that f ()  E for any   Nd and

f

DEM,

=

sup
Nd

f () E ||M

< .

Next, we put

DE(M) = lim- DEM,, 0+

DE{M} = -lim DEM,. 

These spaces contain all convolutions between elements of E and S[[AM]].

Lemma 5.6. The mapping

 : E × S[[AM] ]  DE[M] : (f, )  f  , is well-defined and continuous.

Proof. Take any f  E and   S[[AM] ]. Let q,  > 0 be such that   SAM,1,,q and E()  CE,qeA(qx). By (5.3) we have that, for any   Nd,

Hence

An immediate corollary of the previous convolution mapping is the density of DE[M] in E, as shown in the next result.

Corollary 5.7. The space DE[M] is dense in E.
Proof. Take any   S[[AM] ] such that Rd (x)dx = 1. Put n = nd(n·) and n =   n for any n  1. Note that n  S[[AM] ] by Lemma 4.1 and Rd n(x)dx = 1 by Fubini's Theorem. Let q,  > 0 be such that   SAM,2,qSAM,1,,2q and E (x)  C e . e,q/Hd+1 A(qx/Hd+1) By (4.2) we find

In particular, we have |n(x)|  Ce-A(qx) for every n  1 and some C > 0. For arbitrary   E we have that   n  DE[M] by Lemma 5.6. Moreover, we see that

n(x)[ - Tx] E  2CCE,q/Hd+1

In the sequel, we will often work with the following extra condition on modulation in E:
(5.4) q0 > 0 q1 > 0 (q1 > 0 q0 > 0) C > 0 : E()eM (q0)  CeM (q1).
Note that if E satisfies (5.4), then in particular the family of mappings M : E  E satisfy (3.1).

Remark 5.8. The condition (5.4) imposes stronger conditions on the weight sequence M, the wTMIB E, or on both. It holds in the following cases:
(i) if E is a bounded function on Rd; (ii) if M satisfies (M.2) and supRd E()/(1 + ||)k <  for some k > 0 by (2.2); (iii) if M satisfies (M.2) [31, Proposition 3.6].

As the elements of E, and in particular those of DE[M], are contained in S[A[M] ], we may apply the STFT on them. Due to the specific behavior of the convolution on E,
we are now able to establish the following mapping properties of the (adjoint) STFT on DE[M].

Proposition 5.9. Suppose E is a wTMIB such that (5.4) holds. Then, the mappings

V : DE[M] × S[[AM] ]  C[M](E) : V  : C[M](E) × S[[AM] ]  DE[M] :

(f, ) - Vf (, ) - V

are well-defined and continuous.

Proof. Take any f  DE[M] and   S[[AM] ]. Then, for any q > 0 let  > 0 be such

that (for a fixed  > 0 let q > 0 be such that) f  DEM,,   SAM,1,,q, for which

Next, we show that V  is continuous. Take any   C[M](E) and   S[[AM]]. For any

We end this section with three corollaries of Proposition 5.9. The first is a density result in case E is a TMIB.
Corollary 5.10. If E is a TMIB such that (5.4) holds, then, S[[AM]] is dense in DE[M].
Proof. Take any f  DE[M] and let   S((AM)) be as in Lemma 4.3. Then Vf  C[M](E) by Proposition 5.9. Using Lemma 3.3, we find a net ( ) in C[M](S[[AM]]) such that lim  = Vf . Applying Proposition 5.9 once more and using (4.9) we see that lim V = f in DE[M]. Finally, by Proposition 4.2 we have that (V ) is a net in S[[AM] ], from which the result follows.
Second, we are able to easily determine the topological structure of DE[M].
Corollary 5.11. Suppose E is a wTMIB such that (5.4) holds. Then, DE(M) is a quasinormable and thus distinguished Fr´echet space, and DE{M} is a complete (LB)space.
Proof. By (4.9) and using Proposition 5.9 with the window  as in Lemma 4.3, we see that DE[M] is isomorphic to a complemented subspace of C[M](E). The result now follows immediately from Lemma 3.1.
Finally, we are also able to detect when an element of E belongs to the space DE[M].

6. The convolutor spaces OC (S[[AM] ], E)
For any wTMIB E of class [M] - [A], we define the convolutor space
OC (S[[AM] ], E) = {f  S[A[M] ] | f    E for any   S[[AM] ]}.
Fix a f  OC (S[[AM]], E). By the separate continuity of the convolution mapping (4.8) and De Wilde's closed graph theorem, it follows that the mapping f : S[[AM]]  E :   f   is continuous. We then endow OC (S[[AM]], E) with the topology induced by the embedding
 : OC (S[[AM] ], E)  Lb(S[[AM] ], E) : f  f ,
where for any two lcHs X and Y , Lb(X, Y ) denotes the space of all continuous linear mappings X  Y with the strong topology.
The aim of this section is to study the topology and structure of the space OC (S[[AM]], E), with our main result being the proof of Theorem 1.1. Once more our primary tool will be the application of the (adjoint) STFT. Throughout this section we assume M and A to be two weight sequences satisfying (M.1) and (M.2), and E to be a wTMIB of class [M] - [A] satisfying the condition (5.4).

6.1. Characterization via the STFT. We consider the continuity of the (adjoint) STFT on OC (S[[AM] ], E) with respect to the space C[M],d(E). As a preliminary result, we first verify the bornologicity of the vector-valued tempered ultradistributions.
Lemma 6.1. Lb(S[[AM] ], E) is bornological.
Proof. In the Beurling case, in view of [4, Observation 9(a)], it suffices to show that S((AM)) is a quasinormable Fr´echet T-space. Using [4, Proposition 4(a)] and the fact that any Fr´echet-Schwartz space is quasinormable, this is a direct consequence of S((AM)) being nuclear and having a continuous norm as shown in [10, Theorem 1.2]. In the Roumieu case, it follows from the nuclearity of S{{AM}} that Lb(S{{AM}}, E) = S{{AM} }E, where the latter space is a Fr´echet space [29, Chapitre II, Th´eor`eme 12, p. 76], so that in particular Lb(S{{AM}}, E) is bornological.

22

L. NEYT

We may now describe the mapping properties of the (adjoint) STFT on OC (S[[AM]], E) as follows.
Proposition 6.2. Let , 0, 1  S((AM)) and write  = 0  1. Then, the mappings
V : OC (S[[AM] ], E)  C[M],d(E) and V : C[M],d(E)  OC (S[[AM] ], E)
are well-defined and continuous.
Proof. We first show that V is well-defined and continuous. Note that for any f  S[A[M] ] we have Vf () = (M-f )   = M-[f  (M)]. As a result, it suffices to show that f  f  (M ) is a continuous linear map OC (S[[AM] ], E)  C[M],d(E) and   M- is a continuous linear map C[M],d(E)  C[M],d(E). We start with the first mapping. Let B  Lb(S[[AM]], E) be a bounded set, then B is equicontinuous by the Banach-Steinhaus theorem. Let X[] be as in (4.6), then it follows that for some  > 0 (resp. for any  > 0) B may be extended to a bounded subset of Lb(X[], E). For any   Rd and L  B we now have,
L(M ) E  L Lb(X[],E) M X[]  C  X[/2] L e . Lb(X[],E) M (4/)
This shows that the linear map
Lb(S[[AM] ], E)  C[M],d(E) : L  (  L(M )),
is well-defined and moreover it maps bounded sets of Lb(S[[AM]], E) into bounded sets of C[M],d(E). As Lb(S[[AM]], E) is bornological by Lemma 6.1, it follows that the mapping above is continuous. Now, as the first map is exactly f  f (M), its continuity follows directly. Moving on, if q0, q1 > 0 are such that E()eM (q0)  CeM (q1) for some C > 0. Then, for any   Ce-M (q0·)(E),
e-M (q1) M-() E  E ()e-M (q1) () E  C  . Ce-M (q0·) (E)
The continuity of the second map then follows by (5.4). Next, we consider V. As C[M],d(E) is continuously embedded into C[M],d(S[A[M] ]), it
follows from Proposition 4.5 that V  S[A[M] ] for any   C[M],d(E). We now show that V  OC (S[[AM] ], E). Take any   S[[AM] ]. Then, by (2.3),

V   = (M[()  ])  d = M[()    (M-)]d

Rd

Rd

= M[()  V()]d. Rd
Lemma 3.2 applied to the continuous bilinear map  : E × S[[AM]]  E and the family  = M, gives by (5.4) the hypocontinuous bilinear map

C[M](S[[AM] ]) × C[M],d(E)  E : ( , S[[AM]] E )  Rd M [  S[[AM]] ()  E (-)]d.

CONVOLUTORS OF TRANSLATION-MODULATION INVARIANT BANACH SPACES 23

In particular, by Proposition 4.2, we find that V    E for any   S[[AM]], so that V  OC (S[[AM] ], E). Moreover, if B  C[M],d(E) is a bounded subset, then {V :   B} will be an equicontinuous subset of L(S[[AM]], E), so that by the BanachSteinhaus Theorem the set {V :   B} will be bounded in OC (S[[AM]], E). As C[M],d(E) is bornological, the continuity of V follows.

Corollary 6.3. The following dense inclusions hold: DE[M]  E  OC (S[[AM] ], E).
Additionally, if E is a TMIB, then, S[[AM] ] is dense in OC (S[[AM] ], E).

Proof. As E is continuously contained in OC (S[[AM]], E) by (5.2), it suffices by Corollary 5.7 to show that DE[M] is dense in OC (S[[AM] ], E). Let   S((AM)) be as in Lemma 4.3. For any f  OC (S[[AM] ], E), Vf  C[M],d(E) by Proposition 6.2. Using Lemma 3.4, we find a net ( ) in C[M](E) such that lim  = Vf . By (4.9) and another application of Proposition 6.2 it follows that lim V = f . Proposition 5.9 tells us that (V ) is a net in DE[M], which shows the required density. The final statement now follows directly.

Corollary 6.4. OC (S((AM)), E) is a complete (LB)-space, and OC (S{{AM}}, E) is a quasinormable and thus distinguished Fr´echet space.

Proof. By Proposition 6.2 and (4.9) we see that OC (S[[AM]], E) is isomorphic to a complemented subspace of C[M],d(E), hence the result follows immediately from Lemma 3.1.

In the non-quasianalytic case, we get the following.

Theorem 6.5. Let f  D[M]. Then, f  OC (S[[AM] ], E) if and only if f    E for any   D[M].

Proof. If f  OC (S[[AM] ], E) then trivially f    E for any   D[M]  S[[AM] ]. We now show the reverse implication. Take any   D[M] \ {0}. By an analogous argument as

in the proof of continuity of V in Proposition 6.2, one can show that Vf  C[M],d(E).

Consequently,

As

show that (4.9) holds in D[M] (with windows in D[M]), it follows that f  OC (S[[AM] ], E).

6.2. Structural theorem. We now move on to prove Theorem 1.1. To do this, we

introduce the following spaces of vector-valued multi-sequences. Let E be a Banach

space. For any  > 0 we define M,(E) as the Banach space of all (multi-indexed) sequences (e)Nd  ENd such that

(e)Nd

||M

24

L. NEYT

Then, we define the spaces,

(M)(E) = -lim M,(E), 0+

{M}(E) = lim- M,(E). 

(M)(E) is a complete (LB)-space by [3, Theorem 2.6] and {M}(E) is a Fr´echet space. For a Banach space F , we write (M)(F ) := {1/M}(F ) and {M}(F ) := (1/M)(F ). We then have the following canonical isomorphisms of lcHs

([M](E)) = [M](E).

We fix a TMIB E of class [M] - [A] satisfying (5.4). Note that by Remark 5.3, E will be a wTMIB, and moreover it satisfies (5.4) as well. We can now reformulate
Theorem 1.1 as follows.

Theorem 6.6. The mapping S : [M](E)  OC (S[[AM] ], E),
is surjective.

For the remainder of this section, we focus on proving Theorem 6.6. First of all, we first need to verify that in fact S is a well-defined map.

Lemma 6.7. S is a well-defined continuous linear map.

Proof. Consider any (f)Nd  [M](E) and take an arbitrary bounded subset B  S[[AM] ]. Then, for certain q,  > 0 we have (f)Nd  M,(E), B  SAM,1,,/q2 and is
bounded there, and E(x)  CE,qeA(qx). We get, by (5.3),

from which the result follows.

To show that mapping S is surjective, we will employ the following abstract criterion.

Lemma 6.8. Let X, Y, and Z be lcHs and S : X  Y be a continuous linear mapping. Suppose X is Mackey, X/ ker S is complete, Im S is Mackey for the topology induced by Y , and there exists a topological isomorphism  : Z  Y . We write R = St  . Then, S is surjective if the following two conditions are satisfied:
(1) R is injective; (2) Im R is weakly closed in X.

CONVOLUTORS OF TRANSLATION-MODULATION INVARIANT BANACH SPACES 25

Proof. Note that if R is injective and has weakly closed image, then so does St. The result then follows from [9, Lemma 1].

To apply Lemma 6.8, a good description of the dual of OC (S[[AM]], E) is required. In the next result we show this to be DE[M ].

Proposition 6.9. Let , , 0, 1  S((AM)) be such that  = 0  1 and (, )L2 = 0. The mapping

 : DE[M ]  (OC (S[[AM] ], E))b :

g



(f



1 (, )L2

Vg(), Vf (-) d)

is a topological isomorphism.

Proof. As DE[M ] is webbed and (OC (S[[AM] ], E))b is ultrabornological by Corollary 6.4, it suffices, by De Wilde's open mapping theorem, to show that  is a bijective continuous
linear map.
Using Lemma 3.2, we find the hypocontinuous bilinear map

C[M](E) × C[M],d(E)  C : (E, E) 

E(), E(-) d.

Rd

By Proposition 5.9 and Proposition 6.2, we see that for any bounded set B  DE[M ], the family of linear maps

OC (S[[AM] ], E)  C :

f 1 (, )L2

Vg(), Vf (-) d,

g  B,

form an equicontinuous, and hence bounded subset of (OC (S[[AM] ], E))b. As DE[M ] is bornological, we find that  is continuous.
We now show the injectivity of . Suppose that for g1, g2  DE[M ] we have (g1) = (g2). In particular,

  S[[AM] ].

By (4.10) it follows that g1 and g2 coincide on S[[AM] ]. As S[[AM] ] is dense in E, we see that
g1 = g2 in DE[M ]. Finally, we show that  is surjective. Take any g  (OC (S[[AM]], E))b. By Corollary 6.3
it follows that g is an element of E, whence so is Vg() = (M-g)   for any   Rd. As g is a continuous map OC (S[[AM] ], E)  C, there exists a bounded subset B  S[[AM] ] such that

Vg() E = sup | (M-g)  , e | = sup | g, M-(e  ) |

By Lemma 5.6 and Proposition 5.9 we have that {V[e  ]() : e E  1,   B} is a bounded set in C[M](E). Hence, for every q > 0 (for some q > 0) we have that

sup eM (q) Vg() E  sup sup sup eM (q) V[e  ]() E < .

We then infer from Corollary 5.12 that g  DE[M ]. By (4.10) g and (g) coincide on S[[AM] ], so that by Corollary 6.3 they describe the same element in (OC (S[[AM] ], E))b.

Let   S((AM)) be as in Lemma 4.3 and take  with respect to . We now consider the map R = St  . By the previous result, we know exactly what this mapping looks like.

Corollary 6.10. The map R is the continuous linear mapping DE[M ]  [M](E) : g  ((-1)||g())Nd .
In particular, R is injective.

Proof. The mapping above is clearly a well-defined continuous linear map. Now, for any g  DE[M ] and (f)Nd  [M](E), we have that

R(g), (f)Nd =

Vg(), V[f()](-) d.

Nd Rd

By (4.10) it holds that for any   S[[AM] ],

Vg(), V[()](-) d = g, () = (-1)|| g(),  .
Rd
As S[[AM]] is dense in E, we may extend the previous identity, so that in particular,

R(g), (f)Nd =

(-1)|| g(), f .

Nd

Consequently, the mappings coincide.

We are now sufficiently prepared to prove Theorem 6.6.

Proof of Theorem 6.6. We show the surjectivity of S by applying Lemma 6.8 to X =

[M](E), Y = OC (S[[AM] ], E) and Z = DE[M ]. Now, [M](E) is Mackey as it is barreled,

while [M](E)/ ker S is complete as [M](E) is complete. Next, we show that Im S is

Mackey. As OC (S{{AM}}, E) is a Fr´echet space, no further work is needed in the Roumieu

case. For the Beurling case, we will show that Im S is Mackey by showing that it is

infrabarreled, that is, we have to prove that every strongly bounded set B in (Im S) is

equicontinuous. As Im S is dense in OC (S((AM)), E) (since R is injective, hence also St),

we have by Proposition 6.9 that (DE[M ]) = (Im S). For arbitrary  > 0, consider the

set

which shows that -1(B) is a bounded set in DE(M ). Then, because of Proposition 6.9 and the fact that OC (S((AM)), E) is barreled by Corollary 6.4, B is an equicontinuous subset of (Im S).
It remains to show that Im R is weakly closed in [M](E). Let (gj)j be a net in DE[M ] and (h)Nd an element of [M](E) such that R(gj) = ((-1)||gj())Nd  (h)Nd weakly in [M](E). In particular, (-1)||g()  h weakly in E for any   Nd. Note that for any   S[[AM] ] and   Nd,

h(0),

gj(),

As S[[AM] ] is dense in E, we see that h(0) = (-1)||h  E for any   Nd. Since

( h(0) ) E Nd = ( h ) E Nd  [M](R),

we see that h0  DE[M ]. Consequently, (h)Nd = ((-1)||h(0))Nd  Im R.

7. Spaces associated to a DTMIB

Let M and A be weight sequences satisfying (M.1) and (M.2), and suppose E is a DTMIB coming from a TMIB E of class [M] - [A] satisfying (5.4). In general one may not apply Theorem 1.1 to obtain the structure of OC (S[[AM] ], E) as S[[AM] ] is not necessarily dense in E, see Remark 5.3. In this section we will show that the first structural theorem may still be obtained if one looks at the strong dual of DE[M], commonly denoted by DE[M ]. By Corollary 5.7 and Corollary 5.10 we know that DE[M ] is a subspace of S[A[M] ] containing E. However, we will now see that it is exactly the space OC (S[[AM] ], E).
Proposition 7.1. DE[M ] = OC (S[[AM] ], E) as locally convex spaces.

28

L. NEYT

Proof. We first show that DE[M ] is continuously contained in OC (S[[AM] ], E). For any f  DE[M ] and   S[[AM] ], by Lemma 5.6, f   may be seen as an element of E via the evaluation f  , e = f, e   , e  E. If B0  S[[AM]] is a bounded set, then B1 = {e   :   B0, e E  1} is a bounded set in DE[M] by Lemma 5.6. Consequently, it follows that for any bounded set B  DE[M ] we have

sup sup f   E = sup sup | f,  | < .

f B B0

f B B1

Thus, B is a bounded subset of OC (S[[AM] ], E). As DE[M ] is bornological by Corollary 5.11, we find the first continuous inclusion.
To show that OC (S[[AM] ], E) is continuously contained in DE[M ], it suffices by Proposi-
tion 6.2 and (4.9) to show that for any   S((AM)) the mapping V : C[M],d(E)  DE[M ] is
well-defined and continuous. For any f  E and   DE[M] we have that M[f ],  = f, V(-) . By Lemma 3.2 and Proposition 5.9 we find the hypocontinuous bilinear
mapping

DE[M] × C[M],d(E)  C : (, ) 

(), V(-) d.

Rd

The right-hand side is exactly V,  , from which we already see that V  DE[M ]. Also, for any bounded set B  C[M],d(E), the set {V :   B} is an equicontinuous and thus bounded subset of DE[M ]. As C[M],d(E) is bornological, the continuity of V : C[M],d(E)  DE[M ] follows.

Corollary 7.2. If E is reflexive, then so are DE[M] and OC (S[[AM] ], E).

Proof. By Proposition 7.1 we have that OC (S[[AM] ], E) is exactly the dual of DE[M ], so it suffices to show that DE[M] is reflexive for any reflexive TMIB E. Now, DE[M] = (DE[M ])b as sets by Propositions 6.9 and 7.1, i.e. DE[M] is semi-reflexive. As DE[M] is barreled, we may conclude it is reflexive.

We now go further into the structure of DE[M ]. For our proof to work in the Roumieu case though, we will have to establish the so-called projective description of DE{M}. To this purpose, we introduce the following set

R = {r = (rj)jN  RN+ : rj   and rj  rj+1, j  N}.

Then, for any r  R, we define the weight sequence Mr = (Mp

p j=0

rj

)pN.

We find

the next result.

Lemma 7.3. We have the following isomorphism as locally convex spaces DE{M} = lim- DEMr,1.
rR

CONVOLUTORS OF TRANSLATION-MODULATION INVARIANT BANACH SPACES 29

Proof. Write DE{M} = lim-rR DEMr,1, then it follows from [32, Lemma 3.4] that DE{M} and DE{M} coincide as sets. It is clear that DE{M} is continuously contained in DE{M}, so we now show the converse is also true. Take any p  csn(DE{M}) and let B  DE{M} be the polar of the closed unit ball of p. By the bipolar theorem we have that

p() = sup | f,  |,
f B

  DE{M}.

The set B is strongly bounded in DE{M}, hence also in OC (S[[AM] ], E) by Proposition 7.1. Take   S((AM)) as in Lemma 4.3, then by Proposition 6.2 we have

sup sup Vf () E e-M (q) < ,
f B Rd

q > 0.

Using [12, Lemma 4.5] there is some r  R and C > 0 such that

Vf () E  CeMr (),

f  B,   Rd.

In view of [40, Lemma 2.3] we may assume that Mr satisfies (M.2). Choose s = (Hd+1rj)  R, then for any   DE{M}, by the same calculation as in the proof of Proposition 5.9, we have that V(-) E  C  e DEMs,1 -Ms() for any   Rd and some C > 0. Then, for arbitrary f  B and   DE{M}, by (2.2),

Vf (), V(-) d  CC
Rd

 DEMs,1

eMr () Rd eMr (Hd+1) d < .

As S[[AM] ] is dense in DE{M} (it is dense in DE{M} by Corollary 5.10) we have by (4.10)

that f,  = Rd Vf (), V(-) d for any f  B and   DE{M}. Consequently, if

we put Cp = CC

Rd

d, eMr ()
eMr (Hd+1)

it

follows

that

p()  Cp  , DEMs,1

  DE{M},

so that in particular p  csn(DE{M}).

We now obtain the ensuing structural theorem for OC (S[[AM]], E).

Theorem 7.4. For any f  S[A[M] ], the following statements are equivalent:

(i) f    E for any   S[[AM] ]; (ii) f  DE[M ]; (iii) there exists (f)Nd  [M](E) such that f =

Nd f().

Proof. (i)  (ii). Follows by Proposition 7.1. (ii)  (iii). Take any f  DE[M ], then by the Hahn-Banach theorem we may extend
f to an element of (DEN,) for N = M and some  > 0 (N = Mr for some r  R and  = 1 in view of Lemma 7.3). The mapping j : DEN,  1/N,1/(E) given by j() = ((-1)||())Nd is an isometry, so that f, j() = f,  defines a continuous linear map on j(DEN,). Another application of the Hahn-Banach theorem allows us to

30

L. NEYT

extend f to an element of [M](E) (where in the Roumieu case we used [32, Lemma 3.4]), after which the representation as in (iii) follows by transposition.
(iii)  (ii). Follows directly from the structure of f .

The space S[[AM] ] is in general not dense in OC (S[[AM] ], E), so one may consider its closure separately. Interestingly enough, this turns out to be a convolutor space as well. We introduce the Banach space E  as the closure of S[[AM]] in E. Then clearly E  is TMIB of class [M] - [A] satisfying (5.4). Of course, if E is a TMIB, then E = E .
We now find the following characterization.

Theorem 7.5. Let f  S[A[M] ]. Then, the following statements are equivalent:
(i) f    E  for any   S[[AM] ]; (ii) f is contained in the closure of S[[AM] ] in OC (S[[AM] ], E); (iii) there exists (f)Nd  [M](E ) such that f = Nd f().

Proof. (i)  (ii). Take   S((AM)) as in Lemma 4.3. By Proposition 6.2 we have that Vf  C[M],d(E ). By Lemma 3.3 and Lemma 3.4, we see that C[M](S[[AM] ]) is dense in C[M],d(E ), hence there is a net ( ) in C[M](S[[AM] ]) such that lim  = Vf . Note that C[M],d(E ) is a topological subspace of C[M],d(E), so the same limit holds there. Then, in view of Proposition 4.2, Proposition 6.2 and (4.9), it follows that lim V = f in OC (S[[AM] ], E) where (V ) is a net in S[[AM] ].
(ii)  (i). Suppose that f  OC (S[[AM] ], E) is the limit of some net ( ) in S[[AM] ]. In particular f  DE[M ] by Proposition 7.1. For any   S[[AM] ], in view of Lemma 5.6, {e   : e  E, e E  1} is a bounded subset of DE[M]. Hence, it follows that

lim 

f   -

lim 

sup | f -  , e   | = 0.
e E1

As (  ) is a net in S[[AM] ] by Lemma 4.1, we see that f    E . (i)  (iii). This follows directly from Theorem 1.1.

We end this section by considering some concrete examples. Take a measurable function  : Rd  (0, ) such that  and -1 are locally bounded. For a given weight sequence N, we say that  is (N)-admissible ({N}-admissible) if
q > 0 (q > 0) C > 0 x, t  Rd : (x + t)  C(x)eN(qt).

Note that for example E is [A]-admissible and E is [M]-admissible. Also remark that if  is [N]-admissible, then in particular for some q > 0 (for every q > 0) there is a C > 0 such that
1 e-N (qt)  (x)  CeN (qt). C

Now, for any p  [1, ) we define Lp = Lp(Rd) as the Banach space consisting of all measurable functions  on Rd such that

while L  is defined as the Banach space of all measurable functions  on Rd such that

 L  := ess supxRd|(x)|/(x) < .

Using [10, Theorem 1.2], one can easily show that, for p  [1, ), if  is [A]-admissible

Also, for p  (1, ), we 1, while the dual of L1 is

By Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 7.4, we get the following structural theorem.

Theorem 7.6. Let p  [1, ] and  be an [A]-admissible weight function. Then, for

any f  S[A[M] ],

f    Lp,

if and only if there exists (f)Nd  [M](Lp) such that

f=

Nd

We

now

further

consider

the

space

D[M L 

]

,

more

commonly

denoted

by

B[M ] .

The

DTMIB L  is not a TMIB, and S[[AM] ] is not dense in B[M]. Hence one may consider its

closure, denoted by B[M]. Now, one sees that L   = C0,, where the latter is the space of all continuous functions  on Rd such that lim|x| (x)/(x) = 0. Consequently,

B[M] is exactly the space OC (S[[AM] ], C0,), and for this reason it is also known as the space of ultradistributions vanishing at infinity w.r.t. . By Theorem 7.5 we find the

ensuing structural result, first obtained in [9].

Theorem 7.7 ([9, Theorem 1]). Let  be an [A]-admissible weight function. Then, for

any f  S[A[M] ], the following statements are equivalent:

(i) f    C0, for any   S[[AM] ]; (ii) f  B[M];
(iii) there exists (f)Nd  [M](C0,) such that f =

Nd f().

We may also look at the frequency side. Let  be [M]-admissible and we assume one of the following two conditions:

(F .I) C, C, k > 0 : C(1 + ||)-k  ()  C(1 + ||)k; (F .II) M satisfies (M.2).

For p  [1, ] we then define the Banach space F Lp as all those f such that its Fourier transform f  Lp, with the norm f = FLp f , Lp where f is an element of S if (F .I) holds, or of S[A[M] ] if (F .II) holds (note that if (M.2) holds the Fourier transform is an isomorphism between S[[AM] ] and S[[MA]], cfr. [6]). Then, for p  [1, ), F Lp is a TMIB

32

of class [M] - [A] satisfying (5.4). Moreover, F L  is the dual of F L1 so that it is a DTMIB. Once again by Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 7.4 we find.

Theorem 7.8. Let p  [1, ] and  be an [M]-admissible weight function such that either (F .I) or (F .II) holds. Then, for any f  S[A[M] ],

f    F Lp,

  S[[AM] ],

if and only if there exists (f)Nd  [M](F Lp) such that

f=

f() .

Nd

Analogously, by Theorem 7.5, we find the following result for F C0,, the Banach space of all f  F L  such that f  C0,.

Theorem 7.9. Let  be an [M]-admissible weight function such that either (F .I) or (F .II) holds. Then, for any f  S[A[M] ], the following statements are equivalent:
(i) f    F C0, for any   S[[AM] ]; (ii) f is contained in the closure of S[[AM] ] in OC (S[[AM] ], F L  ); (iii) there exists (f)Nd  [M](F C0,) such that f = Nd f().

8. Extensions of convolution

In this final section we study several extensions of convolution arising naturally from

the structure found in Theorem 1.1. Throughout this section we assume M and A are

weight sequences satisfying (M.1) and (M.2), where M additionally satisfies (M.2),

and E is TMIB of class [M] - [A] (which trivially satisfies (5.4), see Remark 5.8).

We first look at OC (S[[AM]], E) itself and show that its elements may convolve with

those

of

D[M ] L1E

and

moreover

those

convolutions

are

all

contained

in

DE[M ].

To

do

this,

we first observe the following continuous mapping.

Lemma 8.1. The mapping

[M

](E

)

×

D[M ] L1E

is well-defined and continuous.

For

we

so that

 2dC0||M f M,2(E)  , DLM1,E/H Nd f  ()  DEM, and the continuity now follows directly.

Take any f  OC (S[[AM] ], E) and let f = Nd f() for some (f)Nd  [M](E).

Using

Lemma

8.1,

we

may

define

the

convolution

of

f

with

any





D[M ] L1E

as

f   :=

f  ()  DE[M].

Nd

To see that this mapping is well-defined, one has to verify whether it is invariant under

the kernel of the structure of OC (S[[AM]], E). If this is the case, we also note that this

definition uniquely extends the convolution (4.4) of Gelfand-Shilov spaces due to the

density

of

S[[AM] ]

in

OC (S[[AM] ], E)

(Corollary

6.3)

and

D[M ] L1E

(Corollary 5.10).

Thus, we

find our first extension of convolution.

Theorem 8.2. The convolution mapping



:

OC

(S[[AM]

],

E)

×

D[M ] L1E



DE[M ]

is well-defined and continuous.

Proof. In view of Lemma 8.1, as OC (S[[AM]], E) = [M](E)/ ker S, to show the result we

must

verify

that

for

any

(f)Nd

 ker S

and





D[M ] L1E

we

have

Nd f  () = 0.

Indeed, for such a fixed (f)Nd we have that the mapping   Nd f  () is

continuous. Take any ,   S[[AM] ], then,

f  (),  =

f(),    = 0.

Nd

As

S[[AM] ]

is

dense

in

D[M ] L1E

by

Corollary

5.10,

it

follows

that





D[M ] L1E

.

Nd f  () = 0 for all

For any f  OC (S[[AM] ], E) and g  OC (S[[AM] ], E), Theorem 8.2 and Proposition 7.1 show that we may define the convolution f  g as follows,

f  g,  := f, g   ,





D[M ] L1E

.

Hence f  g  B[ME ], and in the special case where g  S[[AM] ] it coincides with the convolution as in (4.8). In summary, we find the ensuing second extension of convolution.

Theorem 8.3. The convolution mapping  : OC (S[[AM] ], E) × OC (S[[AM] ], E)  B[ME ]
is well-defined and hypocontinuous.

L. NEYT

For our third and final extension of convolution, we consider the following natural extension of the convolution (5.2) to the corresponding sequence spaces.

Lemma 8.4. The mapping

[M](E) × [M](L1E )  [M](E) : is well-defined and continuous.

((f)Nd , (g)Nd )  (

f  g)Nd

+=

Proof. For any  > 0, let (f)Nd  M,2H (E) and (g)Nd  M,2H (L1E ), then, by (5.3), we have

hence (

f E g L1E

+= f  g)Nd  M,(E) and the continuity follows.

For f  OC (S[[AM] ], E) with structure f = Nd f(), (f)Nd  [M](E), and
g  OC (S[[AM] ], L1E ) with structure g = Nd g(), (g)Nd  [M](L1E ), we can then apply Lemma 8.4 and Theorem 1.1 to define the convolution f  g as

f  g := 

f  g  OC (S[[AM] ], E).

Nd

+=

Again, in order for this definition to be well-defined we have to verify that it is invariant
under the kernel of the structure. Then, this definition will be the unique extension of the convolution  : E × L1E  E, so also of (4.4). Our last extension of convolution may thus be written as follows.

Theorem 8.5. The convolution mapping  : OC (S[[AM] ], E) × OC (S[[AM] ], L1E )  OC (S[[AM] ], E)
is well-defined and continuous.

Proof. Suppose that (f)Nd is in the kernel of S : [M](E)  OC (S[[AM] ], E). The function A : (g)Nd  Nd  ( += f  g) is a continuous linear map [M](L1E )  OC (S[[AM] ], E). Take any ()Nd  [M](E) such that   S[[AM] ] for every   Nd while
 = 0 for a finite amount of . For arbitrary   S[[AM] ] we define  = Nd   (),
then   S[[AM] ]. Now,



f  ,  =

Nd +=

Nd +=

=

f(),   () =

f(),  = 0.

Nd +=

Nd

As the subspace of all such ()Nd is dense in [M](L1E ), the map A is identically zero. Similarly, one shows that for any (g)Nd in the kernel of S : [M](L1E )  OC (S[[AM] ], E), the linear map (f)Nd  Nd  ( += f  g) from [M](E) into OC (S[[AM]], E) is identically zero. This completes the proof.
