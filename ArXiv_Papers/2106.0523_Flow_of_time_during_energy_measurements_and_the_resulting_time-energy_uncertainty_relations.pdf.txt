Uncertainty relations play a crucial role in quantum mechanics. A well-defined method exists for deriving such uncertainties for pairs of observables. It does not include, however, an important family of fundamental relations: the time-energy uncertainty relations. As a result, different approaches have been used for obtaining them in diversified scenarios. The one of interest here revolves around the idea of the existence or inexistence of a minimum duration for an energy measurement with a certain precision. In our study, we use the Page and Wooters timeless framework to investigate how energy measurements modify the relative "flow of time" between internal and external clocks. This provides a unified framework for discussing the topic, recovering previous results and leading to new ones. We also show that the evolution of the external clock with respect to the internal one is non-unitary.
INTRODUCTION
In standard quantum mechanics, while the canonical conjugates position and momentum are treated as observables, the same does not hold for the pair time-energy, for which only energy (associated with a Hamiltonian) is an observable, while time is treated as an external parameter. Since time and position are part of the same object in relativistic theories, the lack of symmetry in their status in quantum mechanics seems to make the incompatibility of this theory with relativity deeper than the incompatibility of earlier non-relativistic theories. An answer to this conundrum was the development of the relativistic quantum field theory, which is, to this day, the main tool to describe the standard model of elementary particles. This approach "downgrades" the status of the position observable to a parameter, putting it alongside time, while "upgrading" quantum particles to the status of fields. In turn, this gives place to the arena of the "classical" Minkowski spacetime, upon where the quantum relativistic fields are defined. Yet, this move does not solve many fundamental issues present in quantum mechanics. In particular, the problem of constructing a consistent quantum theory of gravity remains.
A more recent venue to reconsider this problem is to look back at Einstein's operational approach that led him to discover special relativity in the first place. He achieved a better understanding of space and time not by asking deep metaphysical questions such as what space and time are but answering much more seemingly mundane questions like how do physicists in relative motion synchronize the measurements of length and time between events with rods and clocks. An approach to quantum mechanics that abides by this operational perspective has been coined relational quantum mechanics. It may become instrumental in describing spacetime and gravity quantum mechanically [1]. The main idea is to recognize that clocks and rulers are physical objects and, as such, they must obey quantum mechanical laws. Also, reference frames are always relative to physical objects, and so one is led to the concept of quantum reference frames [2, 3]. As it will be seen, this approach is central to the discussion here.
A related question to the aforementioned relativistic asymmetry of quantum mechanics concerns the existence of a time-energy uncertainty relation. On the one hand, this type of relation is expected to exist in view of relativistic ideas together with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which establishes an uncertainty relation for position and momentum. However, standard approaches for obtaining uncertainty relations, which are appropriate for the study of the relation between two observables [4­8], do not work for time-energy. As a result, there exist multiple ways to address this problem [9]. For instance, Mandelstam and Tamm introduced a time-energy uncertainty relation based on the fact that, in many cases, for a general observable O, the ratio O/ O , where O is the uncertainty of O and O is its time derivative, defines an interval of time [10]. Also, Anandan and Aharonov presented a geometric time-energy uncertainty relation based on the concept of orthogonal-time, defined as the time that it takes for the state of a system to become orthogonal to its initial state [11]. A similar idea to the latter was later examined by Margolus and Levitin in Ref. [12].
However, the approach that is of particular interest here and whose first studies precede the two aforementioned have to do with time-energy relations associated with the process of measurements of energy, i.e., relations that determine how fast such measurements can be made with a certain precision. First, Landau and Peierls argued in

2
favor of an uncertainty relation with a particular model for measuring energy [13]. However, Aharonov and Bohm showed that their model did not provide an optimal energy measurement scheme and, in fact, it is possible to design energy measurements that can be performed arbitrarily fast [14]. Nevertheless, a vast number of measurements are bounded by an uncertainty relation. Investigating the reasons behind it, Aharonov, Massar, and Popescu showed that arbitrarily fast measurements require prior knowledge about the Hamiltonian [15]. In case the Hamiltonian is unknown, as they showed, some time must be spent in the estimation of it. Only after that, the measurement of energy can be conducted arbitrarily fast.
In common, these discussions considered measurements carried out by external systems to the system of interest. However, as analyzed by Aharonov and Reznik, one can also consider the case where the system's energy is measured by a part of it [16]. They suggested that, in this case, the measurement can never be performed arbitrarily fast. However, Massar and Popescu showed that if one considers the proper time (i.e., internal time) of the system of interest, there exists no limit on the speed of the measurement [17].
These studies, directly or indirectly, involve the idea of quantum frames of reference and, in particular, clock frames. In this regard, Page and Wooters introduced a framework for the study of timeless quantum mechanics where a quantum system represents a clock [18]. Assuming the state of the joint system composed by the clock and a system of interest satisfy a certain constraint, known as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, they showed that the unitary Schr¨odinger dynamics of the system of interest could be recovered in their timeless framework. This approach was further developed in Refs. [19­30] and is similar to other approaches in the literature, e.g., in Refs. [31, 32]. It has also been realized experimentally [33, 34].
Among the studies in this area, multiple clocks and how quantum systems evolve from their perspective were considered [26]. Inspired by it, we introduce the discussion about the passage of time during a von Neumann measurement (or pre-measurement since the final "collapse" is not involved) of energy in the timeless framework. This allows us to analyze how the "flow of time" changes during the measurement in an internal or external clock and from the perspective of each of them. Besides the interesting aspects of this analysis on its own, it also provides a unified framework for the study and understanding of time-energy uncertainty relations associated with the processes of energy measurements. Another feature revealed by our results is the appearance of non-unitarity from the internal's clock perspective regardless of the measurement being conducted by an external or an internal system. Finally, we discuss the results presented here as well as some remaining questions that deserve further examination.

RESULTS

Quantum mechanics in the timeless framework

The timeless framework consists of a clock system, whose state is given by a vector in a Hilbert space HA, and the rest of the system, represented by a state in a Hilbert space HR, whose evolution is studied. The joint system |  HA  HR is assumed to be closed and, hence,

HT | = 0,

(1)

where HT is the total Hamiltonian acting on systems A and R. This equation is known as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Observe that the imposition of | being an eigenstate with null eigenvalue by Eq. (1) is not as restrictive as it seems [20]. In fact, Hamiltonians that differ by constant terms are physically equivalent, which is associated with quantum states being defined up to a global phase. Then, Eq. (1) just reads as | not evolving with respect to an external time.
Here, we assume an ideal clock. Then, if TA is the time operator associated with clock A and HA is its free Hamiltonian, we have [TA, HA] = i I and HA = -i /tA. Although the Hamiltonians of these clocks are unbounded from bellow and, hence, unrealistic, ideal clocks help us avoid technicalities associated with real clocks [35, 36] while providing approximations of them [37, 38]. Thus, corrections to the results presented here are expected when dealing with non-ideal clocks.
Moreover, if HR denotes the Hamiltonian of the system of interest and Hint(TA), the interaction between A and R, we have

HT = HA + HR + Hint(TA).

(2)

Replacing it in Eq. (1) and applying a scalar product by an eigenstate |tA of TA on the left, i.e., | = tA| , it

3

holds that



i tA |(tA) = [HR + Hint(tA)] |(tA) ,

(3)

which is the Schr¨odinger equation that gives the evolution of system R with respect to the time measured by clock A. Then, the usual unitary evolution of a quantum system is recovered from the static picture introduced by Page and Wooters.
As a result, | can be written as

| = dtA |tA  |(tA) .

(4)

Because | contains information about |(tA) at every tA, it is referred to as the history state. The approach introduced by Castro-Ruiz et al. in Ref. [26] is central to the results in this work. There, the authors
let system R be composed by a clock B and the rest of it, simply referred to as system S. Then, while system B gives the internal time of the system R = B + S, system A provides time as observed by an external system. This scenario is represented in Fig. 1. In this case, the total Hamiltonian is

HT = HA + HB + HS + Hint(TB).

(5)

Although Hint can be taken to be a function of both TA and TB in a more general scenario, we assume it does not depend on TA for simplicity. However, nothing significant changes in our analysis if Hint is also a function of TA.
With the previous HT , the analog of the Schr¨odinger equation becomes



i tA |(tA) = (HB + HS + Hint(TB)) |(tA) .

(6)

This implies that the effective Hamiltonian acting on system R is

Heff = HB + HS + Hint(TB).

(7)

Even though this result is a particular case of Eq. (3), it is of special interest here because it allows us to study the relation between the "flow of time" in clocks A and B.
While the designation of which clock is internal or external to the system of interest seems to be arbitrary up until now, they will acquire a more concrete meaning in the next sections, where measurements of energy are studied.

Energy measurement carried out by an external system

In this section, we study the von Neumann measurement of the total energy of system R in the Page and Wooters timeless framework. Specifically, we consider the case where the measurement is carried out by an external system. Then, in addition to the systems already introduced up until now, we also consider an external pointer system E, and the history state | is an element of the space HA  HR  HE. This scenario is part of what is illustrated in Fig. 1.
For simplicity, the free evolution of system E will be neglected. Thus, the measurement interaction can be represented by HV N = g(TA)HRPE, where HR = HB + HS + Hint(TB), PE is the momentum conjugated of apparatus E, and g is a non-negative function that differs from zero exclusively during the duration of the measurement. For notation purposes, we assume the measurement starts in clock A at tA = 0 and ends at tA =  . Moreover, we let





g(t)dt = g(t)dt = K,

(8)

-

0

where K is a positive real constant associated with the strength (hence, the precision) of the measurement. Moreover, we assume that PE only takes non-negative values. This will assure that the clocks considered here are
"good" clocks in the sense that they do not move backward in time. With that, the total Hamiltonian of the composed system is HT = HA + HR + g(TA)HRPE. Then, using Eq. (1)
and defining |(tA)  tA| , we obtain the Schr¨odinger equation



i tA |(tA) = [HR + g(tA)HRPE] |(tA) ,

(9)

4

FIG. 1. Representation of the relevant parts in a measurement of the energy of system R. When an external system carries out the measurement, the external clock A is used as a reference by a measurement device E. However, when the internal system performs the measurement, the internal clock B is used as a reference by a pointer I.

i.e., from the perspective of clock A, the evolution is generated by the effective Hamiltonian

H1 = HR + g(tA)HRPE,

(10)

which is the usual Hamiltonian of a time-independent system during a measurement. This is expected since, in standard quantum mechanics, time is an external parameter, as it is in this case.
Using the Heisenberg equation of motion to study the evolution of TB with respect to clock A, we conclude that

d

i

dtA TB = - [TB, H1] = I + g(tA)PE.

(11)

This shows that, when g vanishes, the flow of time in both clocks is the same. In fact, in this case, from the perspective of clock A, any uncertainty in clock B is associated with its initial uncertainty. In particular, if both clocks start localized and synchronized, they remain localized and synchronized.
Yet, clock B ticks faster than clock A whenever g is non-null, i.e., during the measurement of energy. If g is a function whose integral over time grows smoothly, then the transition to a faster ticking also happens smoothly. However, this is not always the case. A dramatic example can be observed by assuming g is a delta function. In this case, from the perspective of clock A, there is a sudden "jump" of the pointer of clock B.
On the other hand, using, again, Eq. (1) and defining |(tB)  tB| , we obtain



i [I + g(TA)PE] tB |(tB) = {HA + HS + Hint(TA) + g(TA)[HS + Hint(TA)]PE} |(tB) .

(12)

Moreover, recalling that PE is assumed to only take non-negative values, which implies that I + g(TA)PE is invertible, the effective Hamiltonian is

H2 = [I + g(TA)PE]-1 HA + HS + Hint(TA).

(13)

Observe that the function g that controls the measurement continues to be a function of the operator TA, while it was a function of the parameter tA when considering A's perspective. In a scenario like this, a well-localized event in clock A has uncertainty in clock B, a result illustrated in Fig. 2 and presented in Ref. [26]. This means, in particular, that the start and end of the measurement, which are well-localized in A, have uncertainty in B.
Moreover, in a sense, Hamiltonian H2 corresponds to a measurement of HA. However, the measurement function g is controlled by the time in clock A, which is an observable from the perspective of B. Because of it, the measurement

Hamiltonian would have been symmetrized in more standard treatments of the process, which is not the case here. In fact, H2 is non-Hermitian and, as a consequence, the evolution of clock A from the perspective of clock B is non-unitary, a characteristic that will be further discussed later in this work. For now, observe that the Heisenberg equation of motion for TA with respect to tB gives

d dtB

TA

i

[TA, H2]

=

[I

+

g(TA )PE ]-1 .

(14)

In view of Eq. (11), this result is expected since it gives the inverse of the passage of time on clock B with respect to clock A. However, once again, it should be noticed that here the argument of g is an operator, and no longer a parameter. Then, with respect to clock B, if clock A starts with some uncertainty, there will be some uncertainty about when the measurement starts and ends. Nevertheless, on average, the "flow of time" during the measurement of energy is expected to be smaller in clock A, whether from the perspective of clock A or clock B.

Energy measurement carried out by an internal system

This section considers, once more, the total energy measurement of system R, although, this time, the measurement in question is carried out by an internal system. We assume that system R has access to an apparatus I, and the history state | is an element of HA  HR  HI , as represented in part of Fig. 1. Note that the apparatus may be assumed to be an internal degree of freedom of the system whose energy is left out of the measurement.
Similarly to what was done in the previous section, the free evolution of the pointer I will be neglected. As a result, the measurement can be represented by the following von Neumann interaction

1

HV N (TB) = 2 [g(TB)HB + HBg(TB)]PI + g(TB)[HS + Hint(TB)]PI ,

(15)

where PI is the momentum conjugated of apparatus I, presupposed to only take non-negative values, and g is the same function introduced in the previous section. Observe the necessary symmetrization of the product g(TB)HB due to the lack of commutativity between TB and HB. Also, we are assuming that, in clock B, the measurement starts at tB = 0 and ends at tB =  .
Since the total Hamiltonian of the composed system is HT = HA+HR+HV N (TB), where HR = HB +HS +Hint(TB), using Eq. (1) and defining |(tA)  tA| , we obtain the Schr¨odinger equation



1

i tA |(tA) = HR + 2 [g(TB)HB + HBg(TB)]PI + g(TB)[HS + Hint(TB)]PI |(tA) .

(16)

This shows that the effective Hamiltonian from the perspective of clock A is

1

H3 = HR + 2 [g(TB)HB + HBg(TB)]PI + g(TB)[HS + Hint(TB)]PI .

(17)

6

With that, the Heisenberg equation of motion for TB with respect to tA is

d

i

dtA TB = - [TB, H3] = I + g(TB)PI .

(18)

On the other hand, using Eq. (1) and defining |(tB)  tB| , we obtain

i

 tB |(tB)

= [I + g(tB)PI ]-1

i HA + HS + Hint(tB) - 2 g (tB)PI + g(tB)[HS + Hint(tB)]PI

|(tB) ,

(19)

where it was used the fact that I + g(tB)PI can be inverted. This means that, from the perspective of clock B, the evolution is generated by the effective Hamiltonian

H4 = [I + g(tB)PI ]-1

i HA - 2 g (tB)PI

+ HS + Hint(tB),

(20)

which, similarly to H2, is a non-Hermitian operator. Then, using the Heisenberg equation of motion to study the evolution of TA with respect to tB, we conclude that

d dtB

TA

=

-

i

[TA,

H4]

=

[I

+

g(tB)PI ]-1,

(21)

which, as expected, up to the difference that the argument of g is, now, a parameter, the inverse of the relation between the passage of time in the two clocks given by Eq. (18).

Measurement and disturbance of the system's dynamics

The standard von Neumann measurement of energy does not disturb the evolution of the observable of interest of the measurement. This can be seen with the measurement of HR given by H1, which corresponds to the standard treatment of the measurement in quantum mechanics. In fact, it can be checked that the tA-derivative of HR vanishes and, as a consequence, [dHR/dtA, HR] = 0, which means that the evolution of HR is not disturbed by the measurement interaction.
In view of that, one may ask whether the measurement of energy carried out by the internal system disturbs system R's dynamics from the external clock's perspective. In this regard, it can be obtained that

d

i

1

dtA HR = - [HR, H3] = - 2 {g (TB), HR} PI .

(22)

and

d

i

dtA HR, H3

=- 2

{g

(TB), HR} PI ,

(23)

where {·, ·} denotes the anticommutator. This means that the dynamics of system R is affected by the measurement of its energy by an internal system. Despite this, by using the Heisenberg equation of motion for the position QI of the pointer, it holds that

QI (tAf ) - QI (tAi ) =

tA f tA i

1 2 {g(TB(tA)), HB} + g(TB(tA))HS + g(TB(tA))Hint(TB(tA)) dtA,

(24)

where the measurement was assumed to start and end at tAi and tAf , respectively, which is something that happens with some probability that depends on the uncertainty of TB from the perspective of A. Then, the shift in the pointer is proportional to the weighted average energy of system R during the measurement's interaction had it not affected
the system's dynamics. To be more precise, the previous result can be rewritten as

QI (tAf ) - QI (tAi ) = K[HB + HS + H¯int],

(25)

where

H¯ int

g(TB(tA))Hint(TB(tA)) dtA.

Before proceeding, observe that the disturbance to the evolution of system R depends on derivatives of the mea-
surement control function g. Most importantly, g can be chosen in such a way that the net disturbance is null.
Now, from the perspective of clock B, it is not possible to talk about a measurement of system R. However, on this
perspective, as already remarked, such a process presents some resemblance with a measurement of HA, with an evident difference that H2 is not symmetrized. Then, we can study the disturbances on HA caused by H2 and, moreover, analyze if the analogy of a measurement of HA holds after some scrutiny. To start, let f (t; PE) = [I + g(t)PE]-1 and observe that

d

i

dtB HA = - [HA, H2] = f (TA; PE)HA - Hint(TA)

(27)

and

d

dtB HA, H2 = -i f (TA; PE)HA - i Hint(TA).

(28)

The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (27) is a non-symmetric analog of the right-hand side of Eq. (22). However, here,

tB f
QE(tBf ) - QE(tBi ) = - [I + g(TA(tB))PE]-1g(TA(tB))HAdtB,
tB i

(29)

where the measurement was assumed to start and end at tBi and tBf , respectively. Because of the lack of commutation between HA with the other terms in this integral, the shift in the pointer does not have a simple relation with HA in general. Hence, H2 does not qualify as an evolution that involves the measurement of HA.
Finally, observe that Hamiltonian H4 does not quite correspond to a measurement of HA either. In fact, it seems to correspond to a measurement of HA - (i /2)g (tB)PI . However, this is, once again, not exactly the case since

d dtB

QI

=

-[I

+

g(tB)PI ]-2

i g(tB)[H - i g (tB)PI ] - 2 g (tB)

(30)

and



QI ( ) - QI (0) = - [I + g(tB)PI ]-2g(tB)[H - i g (tB)PI ]dtB

(31)

0

However, the shift in the pointer seems to correspond to a measurement of a non-canonical variable which is proportional to HA at every instant of time, except during the measurement. Such measurements were inspected in Chapters 7 and 8 of Ref. [39]. They involve, for instance, measurements of the velocity of a particle. While velocity of a free particle is proportional to the canonical momentum of it before and after the measurement, this is not the case during the measurement because of the coupling between the particle's momentum and the pointer. Nonetheless, it should be noticed that a unique aspect of the variable of interest that appears here when compared with the ones considered in Ref. [39] is the fact that it becomes non-Hermitian during the measurement.

Time-energy uncertainty relations
Now, we shall discuss how the comparison between the flow of interior and the exterior time during an energy measurement provides insights into time-energy uncertainty relations associated with the von Neumann measurement of energy. As already mentioned, knowing the Hamiltonian beforehand makes a difference when studying these relations since, otherwise, the process of effectively measuring the Hamiltonian includes a preliminary step of estimating it [15]. Here, we focus on the cases the Hamiltonian of system R is known and leave the study of estimation of Hamiltonians to future work.
It should be noticed that, because of the explicit inclusion of the frames associated with the internal and external clocks, our analysis becomes slightly more subtle than others presented up until now. While, like the previous works, we can consider which time (internal or external) one wants to optimize when an internal or external system carries out the measurement, we have to also specify with respect to which clock frame (internal or external) the question is being asked. However, our approach has the advantage of introducing a unified framework to analyzing time-energy

8

FIG. 3. Representation of the duration of energy measurements in internal (A) and external (B) clocks. When an external system carries out the measurement, its duration in B is longer on average, as illustrated in panel a. However, when an internal part of the system is responsible for the measurement, its duration in the external clock is shorter on average, as seen in panel b.

uncertainty relations, which qualifies us to recover previous results and determine the existence or absence of such relations in scenarios where it is still unknown.
To start, we consider measurements carried out by an external system from the perspective of A. First, observe that the measurement function g is controlled by clock A and, then, nothing in the von Neumann measurement procedure we follow imposes a limit on how small the interval where g does not vanishes is, i.e., how fast the measurement can be performed. As a consequence, the external time can be arbitrarily minimized without requiring any compromising of the measurement accuracy, i.e., without imposing any restriction on the constant K. This corresponds to the result obtained by Aharonov and Bohm in Ref. [14], which shows the nonexistence of an uncertainty relation in this scenario.
Now, a question that has not been dealt with in the literature thus far concerns the possibility of optimizing the internal time in this scenario. For that, observe that Eq. (11) leads to

TB( ) - TB(0) =  I + KPE.

(32)

This result is represented in Fig. 3a. It shows that the internal duration of the measurement also decreases with optimizations of the external time. However, this approach can only reduce the internal duration up to KPE. Thus, in order to obtain an arbitrarily small internal duration, it is necessary to decrease the value of the constant K. More precisely,

TB( ) - TB(0)  K PE > 0.

(33)

This means that there exists a trade-off between the precision of the measurement (which is associated with K) and how long the measurement lasts in the internal clock, i.e., there exists a time-energy uncertainty relation. Note that such a relation is independent of the uncertainty of the operator TB.
Moreover, taking uncertainties into consideration, we also obtain a different type of relation that has a flavor of a Mandelstam and Tamm uncertainty relation. In fact, observe that the uncertainty TB in the duration of the experiment in clock B from clock A's perspective is associated with the uncertainty PE of PE. More precisely, TB grows with PE. Then, in order to obtain a smaller TB, it is necessary to decrease PE. However, a smaller PE leads to a decreasing in the uncertainty of the measurement since the uncertainty of the pointer's position also decreases.
Now, from the perspective of clock B, the analysis of the measurement carried out by an external system leads mostly to the same conclusions. In fact, if tBi and tBf mark the beginning and the end of the measurement, which

9

happens with some probability, Eq. (14) implies that

tBf - tBi =

tB f
[I
tB i

+

g(TA (tB ))PE ]

dTA dtB

(tB )

dtB

(34)

or, equivalently,

tBf - tBi = TA(tBf ) - TA(tBi ) + KPE .

(35)

Note that, on average, TA(tBf ) - TA(tBi ) gives  . Then, the only difference in the analysis from B's perspective is that the time in clock A is given by an operator and, hence, has an uncertainty associated with it, which, in turn, leads to an uncertainty about when the measurement starts and ends. This leads to a Mandelstam and Tamm-like uncertainty relation for the duration of the measurement and its precision associated with the uncertainties of both clocks A and B. However, in terms of the uncertainty relations of main interest here, conclusions about their existence or not are independent of perspective.
Finalized the analysis of the measurement performed by an external system, we consider now the measurement carried out by an internal system. Again, we start by pointing out that, from the perspective of B, nothing in our description disallows the measurement to be conducted arbitrarily fast. Then, there exists no uncertainty relation in this case, a conclusion that corroborates the result obtained by Massar and Popescu in Ref. [17].
Furthermore, still from the perspective of clock B, we can address the question about the existence of such a relation for the external time, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been answered in the literature prior to this work. Note that Eq. (21) implies that



TA( ) - TA(0) = [I + g(tB)PI ]-1dtB,

(36)

0

as represented in Fig. 3b. With the hypothesis that the evaluation of PI is non-negative, it holds that the norm of the last integral is bounded by  (independently of K), i.e., the duration of the measurement in clock A can be as small as its duration in clock B -- in fact, it is, in general, smaller. Since the duration can be arbitrarily small in clock B, there exists no time-energy uncertainty relation for clock A from the perspective of clock B.
This is a rather surprising result. In fact, Massar and Popescu briefly consider this scenario in Ref. [17], where they presented a conjecture stating that an uncertainty relation should hold.
Before jumping into A's perspective, it should be noticed once again an uncertainty relation `a la Mandelstam and Tam for the duration of the measurement in clock A.
Now, from the perspective of clock A, the conclusions are, once again, similar. Suppose the measurement starts and ends at tAi and tAf , respectively. Then, Eq. (18) implies that

tAf - tAi =

tA f
[I
tA i

+

g(TB(tA))PI ]-1

dTB dtA

(tA) dtA.

(37)

Since the evaluation of g(TB)PI is assumed to be non-negative, the average of the right-hand is not greater than the average of the integral of dTB/dtA, which is  . Hence, the only difference in the analysis from A's frame is the uncertainty associated with TB, which leads to a Mandelstam and Tamm-like uncertainty relation for the duration of the measurement in both clocks A and B.

Emergence of non-unitarity
As noticed earlier in the context of energy measurements, an interesting feature of the dynamics generated by the measurement of energy is that, from the perspective of the internal clock, it is non-unitary regardless of whether an external or an internal system carries out the measurement.
One may expect that this feature has some resemblance to gravitational effects [40]. Indeed, as it is known from relativistic theories, energy and mass are related to each other. Then, while measuring the energy of a system that includes an internal clock, there is a sense in which the mass of the system and, in particular, the mass of the clock is being weighed. However, in Ref. [26], the authors showed that gravitationally interacting clocks, defined as clocks whose joint Hamiltonian contains terms with products of the conjugates of their time operators (i.e., products of their individual Hamiltonians), lead to unitary dynamics.

10

Then, why is the result different here? The answer to this question lies in the fact that the von Neumann interaction includes products of the time operator of a clock by the individual Hamiltonian of the same or other clocks. In fact, if such a condition is matched, the dynamics of the clocks associated with the time operator in the interaction is non-unitary with respect to the clock whose individual Hamiltonian appears multiplying it. To see that, consider a system composed of n clocks C1, C2, . . . , Cn and let the total Hamiltonian be

H = HCk + f (TCr1 , TCr2 , . . . , TCrm )HCs + Hint,

where m < n, the indices r1, r2, . . . , rm, and s are different elements of {1, 2, . . . , n}, and Hint is not a function of Hs. Then, from the perspective of Cs we can write

i.e., the effective Hamiltonian, which is to be compared with H2, is

(40)

assuming that I + f (TCr1 , TCr2 , . . . , TCrm ) is invertible. This Hamiltonian is manifestly non-Hermitian. More specifically, the parts associated with clocks Cr1 , Cr2 , . . . , Crm are non-Hermitian and, hence, have non-unitary evolution because of the lack of commutativity between their individual time and Hamiltonian operators.
The only scenario that remains to be analyzed now corresponds to the case where an interaction between the time
operator and the individual Hamiltonian of the same clock exists. For that, suppose the total Hamiltonian is given
by

assuming that I + f (tCs ) is invertible. This Hamiltonian is be compared with H4. Although there is no commutation problem, the Hamiltonian in this case is also non-Hermitian because of the imaginary unit multiplying f (tCs ).
Despite the differences between the discussion in the present work and the scenario studied in Ref. [26], there
exists an aspect that leads to a similar analysis: the term between brackets on the left-hand side of Eq. (39) can be
interpreted as a "redshift" operator, which, combined with the tCs -derivative operator, results in a derivative with respect to a time operator T , i.e.,







i

Observe that, with these coordinates, the unitarity of the dynamics is restored. However, a complete change to clock Cs's referential leads to the observation of the "redshift," an analogy that leads to the conclusion that clock Cs is not an inertial frame of reference.
A similar analysis can be made with Eq. (42). However, in this case, the non-unitarity of the dynamics persists even when the derivative with respect to an operator T , which consists of the tCs -derivative operator combined with the "redshift" factor, is considered.

DISCUSSION
Using the Page and Wooters framework, we have studied how the relation between internal and external "flow of time" in quantum clocks changes during energy measurements conducted either by an external or internal system. Some of these measurements, as was discussed, cause disturbances in the energy of the systems, which are independent of the duration of the measurements. While there is no penalty for conducting a fast energy measurement (in terms of disturbances added to it), the change in the flow of time between an external and an internal clock reveals a minimum duration in the internal clock of a measurement with a given precision carried out by an external system. Any other scenario considered here led to the conclusion of an absence of a time-energy uncertainty relation in the sense of Landau and Peierls [13] -- although connections with Mandelstam and Tamm's approach can be made, depending on the clock frame used for the analysis of the problem.
Importantly, the time-energy uncertainty relations considered here assume the Hamiltonian being measured to be known beforehand. However, as mentioned in the Introduction, if this is not the case, the Hamiltonian has to be estimated. While Ref. [15] shows the existence of a minimum duration in an external clock for an external system to estimate the Hamiltonian of the system of interest, a discussion about the relation of this time interval and the interval observed in an internal clock remains to be conducted. Moreover, the scenario where an internal system attempts to estimate its total Hamiltonian has yet to be investigated. An interesting aspect of the proof provided by Aharonov, Massar, and Popescu in Ref. [15] is that it involves the time necessary for the state of a system to become orthogonal to its initial state under a designed evolution. Then, the type of uncertainty relation that arrives from it is of the geometric type, briefly mentioned in the Introduction and originally discussed by Anandan and Aharonov in Ref. [11] -- followed by Margolus and Levitin in Ref. [12].
While we concentrated on the measurement's unitary interaction in this work, it is well-known that von Neumann's description of a measurement includes a "collapse" in case the pointer finds itself in a superposition at the end of the process. The inclusion of this final step in our analysis adds various new subtleties to our analysis. On the one hand, since time and energy of a clock are canonically conjugated, there exists an uncertainty relation for a measurement carried out by an internal system, meaning that time in the internal clock can only be known up to a certain precision given a desired precision for the measurement of energy. This is a Heisenberg-like uncertainty relation and is captured by entropic time-energy uncertainty relations recently introduced by Boette et al. [41] and Coles et al. [42]. On the other hand, the inclusion of a "collapse" in our description would necessarily violate Eq. (1). This is a known problem in the measurement of quantum clocks and, more generally, of any quantum system satisfying the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. The typical solution to this problem consists of the inclusion of ancilla systems that act as the measurement device and register the measurement outcome [20, 26, 29, 32]. This perspective solves at least the operational problem of computing the probability of the outcome of (possibly many) measurements. Since our approach includes measurement devices, this problem has been, then, already dealt with (at least from this perspective).
Finally, there still exist many remaining questions concerning the emergence of non-unitarity observed in our study. An immediate analysis can attribute it to the asymmetry imposed by the von Neumann measurement, as it was already discussed throughout the text. However, since this type of evolution always concerns the evolution of the external clock from the perspective of the internal one, it may be connected with the decoherence of the internal clock during the measurement. This is a perspective that deserves further examination. More precisely, one may investigate the connection between non-unitarity emergent in this work with collapse and, in particular, with Refs. [43] and [44], where time dilation was associated with decoherence. Moreover, following the approach of Refs. [45] and [46], the concepts of shared and mutual asymmetry may shed some light on the non-unitary dynamics manifested in this work.
