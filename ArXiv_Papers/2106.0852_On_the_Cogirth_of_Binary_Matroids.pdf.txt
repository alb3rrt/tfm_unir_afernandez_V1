ON THE COGIRTH OF BINARY MATROIDS

CAMERON CRENSHAW AND JAMES OXLEY

Abstract. The cogirth, g(M ), of a matroid M is the size of a small-

est cocircuit of M . Finding the cogirth of a graphic matroid can be

done in polynomial time, but Vardy showed in 1997 that it is NP-

hard to find the cogirth of a binary matroid. In this paper, we show

that g(M )

)|

when

M

is binary, unless M

simplifies to

a projective geometry. We also show that, when equality holds, M

simplifies to a Bose-Burton geometry, that is, a matroid of the form

P G(r - 1, 2) - P G(k - 1, 2). These results extend to matroids repre-

sentable over arbitrary finite fields.

1. Introduction

For an arbitrary graph G, the well-known fact that the degree sum of G is twice the number of edges of G implies that

|E(G)| (G)



1 2

|V

(G)|,

where (G) is the minimum degree of G. In a matroid M of nonzero rank,

the cogirth, g(M ), of M is the size of a smallest cocircuit of M . As Ur,n

shows,

|E(M )| g(M )

can

be

arbitrarily

close

to

1

even

for

simple

matroids,

although

it

is

bounded

below

by

1 2

(r(M

)

+

1)

when

M

is

graphic.

In this paper, we show that, when M is binary,

|E(M )| g(M )



2

unless M simplifies to a projective geometry. We also characterize the matroids that achieve equality in this bound. Both of these results are special cases of results for matroids representable over arbitrary finite fields.
The terminology used here will follow Oxley [2] with the following addition. We will often use Pr and Ar to denote P G(r - 1, q) and AG(r - 1, q), respectively, where q should be clear from the context. The next two results are the main results of the paper.

Theorem 1.1. For r  1, let M be a rank-r matroid representable over GF (q) whose simplification is not Pr. Then

|E(M )| g(M )



q

q -

1.

Moreover, equality holds if and only if M is loopless and, for a fixed embedding of si(M ) in Pr,
(i) the complement of si(M ) in Pr is isomorphic to Pk for some k with 1  k < r; and
(ii) if P is a copy of Pk+1 in Pr containing the complement of si(M ), then the parallel classes of the elements in E(M )  E(P ) all have the same size; and
(iii) |E(N )|  (q - 1)|E(M ) - E(N )| for every restriction N of M that simplifies to Ar.
This theorem excludes the matroids M for which si(M ) = P G(r - 1, q). These excluded matroids are covered by the next result.

Proposition 1.2. For r  1, let M be a matroid that simplifies to P G(r -

1, q). Then

|E(M )| g(M )



qr - 1 qr-1(q -

1) .

Moreover, equality holds if and only if M is loopless and all its parallel

classes have the same size.

Condition (i) in Theorem 1.1 says that M simplifies to a Bose-Burton ge-

ometry [1], that is, a matroid that is obtained from P G(r - 1, q) by deleting

some P G(k - 1, q) where 1  k < r. In each of our results, the bound on

|E(M )| g(M )

is

relatively

easy

to

obtain.

The core

of each proof involves

charac-

terizing when equality holds in the bound. The proofs appear in Section 3.

2. Preliminaries

In a matroid M of rank at least one, a loop contributes to |E(M )| but

not

to

g(M ).

Since

our

concern

here

is

on

bounding

|E(M )| g(M )

below,

we

shall

focus on matroids without loops. It will be convenient here to deal with

the parallel classes in such a matroid M by assigning, to each element of

si(M ), a weight w(e) that is equal to the cardinality of the parallel class

of M that contains e. Thus we deal with simple matroids with associated

weight functions that take a positive-integer value on each element. For a

set X in such a matroid N , we write w(X) for xX w(x) and write w(N ) for w(E(N )). The weight function of N \Y is the restriction of the weight

function of N to E(N ) - Y . When Y is contracted from N , we replace each

parallel class P by a single element eP whose weight in the contraction is

wN (P ). We will call this weighted simple matroid the weighted contraction

of Y and denote it by N/Y , even though the underlying matroid is actually

ON THE COGIRTH OF BINARY MATROIDS

si(N/Y ). The cogirth of a weighted matroid is the minimum weight of a cocircuit.

3. The Proofs

We begin with a lemma that serves as the base case for both of the inductive arguments that prove the inequalities in the main results.

Lemma 3.1. Let M be a simple, rank-2 matroid representable over GF (q), and let w be a weight function on M . Then

w(M ) g(M )



|E(M )| |E(M )| -

1,

with equality if and only if w is constant.

Proof. Let w1  w2  · · ·  wn be the weights of the elements of M . As g(M ) = w1 + w2 + · · · + wn-1, the desired inequality is equivalent to

(n - 1)(w1 + w2 + · · · + wn)  n(w1 + w2 + · · · + wn-1).

Subtracting (n - 1)(w1 + w2 + · · · + wn-1) from each side, we obtain

(3.1)

(n - 1)wn  w1 + w2 + · · · + wn-1,

which is true since wn  wi for all i. Note that equality holds in (3.1) if and only if wi = wn for all i.

The following is the main result of the paper. It is equivalent to Theorem 1.1 and is stated here in terms of weights.

Theorem 3.2. Let M be a simple, rank-r matroid representable over GF (q), and let w be a weight function on M . Suppose M = Pr. Then

w(M ) g(M )



q

q -

1.

Moreover, equality holds if and only if, for a fixed embedding of M in Pr,
(i) the complement of M is isomorphic to Pk, with 1  k < r; and (ii) if P is a copy of Pk+1 containing the complement of M in Pr, then
w is constant on P ; and (iii) w(N )  (q - 1)w(E(M ) - E(N )) for every Ar-restriction N of M .

Proof. We begin by proving the displayed inequality by induction on r. Lemma 3.1 gives the result when r = 2, so suppose r  3. If there is an e in E(M ) with M/e = Pr-1, then, by induction,
(q - 1)w(M ) > (q - 1)w(M/e)  qg(M/e)  qg(M ).
Thus we may assume that M/e = Pr-1 for all e in E(M ). Take a line of Pr that meets both E(M ) and E(Pr) - E(M ). Let X be the set of elements of M on this line and e be a maximum-weight element of X. Let Y = X - e. Note that |Y |  q - 1, so

(3.2)

w(Y )  w(e)(q - 1).

4

CAMERON CRENSHAW AND JAMES OXLEY

Observe that M \Y /e has rank r - 1 but is not isomorphic to Pr-1 so, by the induction assumption,
(q - 1)w(M \Y /e)  qg(M \Y /e).

Now

w(M \Y /e) = w(M ) - w(e) - w(Y ),

and g(M \Y /e)  g(M ) - w(Y ).

Thus

(q - 1)w(M )  qg(M ) + w(e)(q - 1) - w(Y ),

so, by (3.2),

(q - 1)w(M )  qg(M )

as desired. Next we characterize when equality is achieved in the last bound. Let M c
be the complement of the fixed embedding of M in Pr. When M c = Pk for 1  k < r, a hyperplane of Pr either contains this Pk or meets it in a Pk-1. Thus a cocircuit of M is isomorphic to either Ar or Ar - Ak. We call these type-I and type-II cocircuits, respectively, noting that there are no type-I
cocircuits when k = r - 1.

3.2.1. Suppose M satisfies (i) and (ii). If C is a type-II cocircuit of M ,

then

w(C  )

=

q

- q

1 w(M ).

As M satisfies (i), M c = Pk. Since C is a type-II cocircuit, there is a restriction A of Pr isomorphic to Ar such that A meets M c and C =

E(M )  E(A). Let H be the hyperplane of Pr that is the complement of A.

Now,

Pr

consists

of

qr-k -1 q-1

copies

of

Pk+1

containing

Mc,

and

the

pairwise

intersection

of these copies is M c.

Thus M

is the disjoint union of

qr-k-1 q-1

copies of Ak+1. By (ii), the elements in each Ak+1 have the same weight.

To

complete

the

proof

of

3.2.1,

we

show

that

C

contains

exactly

q-1 q

of

the

elements of each Ak+1. Consider the complementary Ak+1 to M c in a fixed Pk+1. Note that Pk+1
consists of q + 1 copies of Pk, including M c, that contain H  E(M c), which

is isomorphic to Pk-1. Therefore, this Ak+1 is the disjoint union of q copies of Ak. Now H meets Pk+1 at a Pk distinct from M c. Thus A meets Pk+1 in a set that is the union of q disjoint copies of Ak, one of which is in M c. This implies that C  Ak+1 is the disjoint union of q - 1 copies of Ak, and 3.2.1

follows.

Now

assume

that

w(M ) g(M )

=

q q-1

.

Then

equality

holds

in

(3.2)

so

|Y |

=

q-1

and w(y) = w(e) for all y  Y . The former implies that every line of Pr

that meets both M and M c contains exactly q points of M . This means

that every line that contains two points of M c lies entirely in M c. Thus M c

is a flat of Pr, proving (i).

ON THE COGIRTH OF BINARY MATROIDS

5

As w(y) = w(e) for all y  Y , it follows that w is constant on each line of

Pr that meets both M and M c. Since a Pk contained in a Pk+1 meets every

line

of

the

Pk+1,

(ii)

is

satisfied.

It

now

follows

from

3.2.1

that

w(M ) g(M )

=

q q-1

if and only if M satisfies (i) and (ii), and the type-I cocircuits of M have

weight

at

least

q-1 q

w(M

).

It is straightforward to check that this third

condition is equivalent to (iii), so the theorem holds.

The reader may find condition (iii) of Theorem 3.2 unsatisfying, and the

next proposition offers a potential replacement, (iii). The example that

follows Proposition 3.3 shows that conditions (i), (ii), and (iii) do not guar-

antee

w(M ) g(M )

=

q q-1

for

a

matroid

M

meeting

the

hypotheses

of

Theorem

3.2.

In addition, the example illustrates the potential difficulty of finding a sat-

isfactory replacement for (iii).

Proposition 3.3. Let M be a simple, rank-r matroid representable over

GF (q), and let w be a weight function on M . Suppose that M = Pr and

that

w(M ) g(M )

=

q q-1

.

Then

(iii) qr-1w(e)  w(M ) for all e in E(M ).

Proof. By Theorem 3.2, M c = Pk. If k = r - 1, then Theorem 3.2(ii) implies that (iii) holds with equality. Thus we may assume that k < r - 1. Extend
the weight function of M to Pr by assigning each element of M c a weight of one. Then contract M c from Pr to form a weighted matroid M  = Pr-k. Fix an element e in E(M ), and let e be the image of e in M . Note that w(M ) = w(M ) and w(e) = qkw(e) under this transformation. Moreover, the type-I cocircuits of M correspond to the cocircuits of M , so the weight of each cocircuit of M  equals the weight of the corresponding type-I cocircuit

of M .

Let C be a cocircuit of M  that avoids e and let H be the complementary

hyperplane

to

C

in

M.

Since

w(M ) g(M )

=

q q-1

,

it

follows

that

q

q -

1

w(C  )



w(M

),

and subtracting w(C) from each side produces

(3.3)

q

1 -

1

w(C

)



w(H

).

Note that (3.3) holds for an arbitrary cocircuit of M  avoiding e, so

we have such an inequality for every such cocircuit. Moreover, C and

H partition E(M ) so, for a fixed f  E(M \e), its weight contributes to

exactly

one side of each

inequality.

Now,

there are

qr-k-1-1 q-1

total

inequalities

as this is the number t of hyperplanes of M  containing e. Similarly, w(f )

contributes

to

the

right-hand

side

of

exactly

qr-k-2-1 q-1

of

these

inequalities

as

this is the number s of hyperplanes of M  containing both e and f . Hence

6

CAMERON CRENSHAW AND JAMES OXLEY

w(f ) contributes to the left-hand side of t-s of these inequalities. Summing these inequalities gives

t q

s 1

w(M



\e

)



sw(M



\e)

+

tw(e

),

and this simplifies to

w(M )  qr-k-1w(e).

Finally, we substitute w(M ) for w(M ) and qkw(e) for w(e) to obtain

w(M )  qr-1w(e)

as desired.

Example 3.4. Let q = 2 and let M = P4 - p for some p  E(P4). Then M = P4 - P1. Take a hyperplane H of P4 containing p, and note that H
has |P3| elements. Then H - p is a hyperplane of M and the corresponding cocircuit C is type-I and has |A4| elements.
Assign the weight 2 to each element of H - p and the weight 1 to each element of C. Then

w(M ) = 2(|P3| - 1) + 1 · |A4| = 2(6) + 8 = 20.

Observe that conditions (i) and (ii) of Theorem 3.2 hold and, since, for all e in E(M ),
qr-1w(e)  23(2) < 20 = w(M ),
so does (iii). However, w(C) = 8, so the equation

(3.4)

w(M ) g(M )

=

q

q -

1

fails. Now, in P4, take a line in C  p and another in H that each meet in {p}.
Swap the weights 1 and 2 on the elements of M on these lines. Note that (i), (ii), and (iii) continue to hold, and w(M ) is unchanged. However, it is
straightforward to check that the weights of the type-I cocircuits of M are at
least 10, so (3.4) holds by Theorem 3.2. Thus, characterizing the matroids
for which equality holds in Theorem 3.2 requires not only restricting the
weights themselves, but also controlling their distribution.

Finally, we prove a proposition equivalent to Proposition 1.2 stated here in terms of weights.

Proposition 3.5. Let M be a matroid isomorphic to P G(r - 1, q) and w be a weight function on E(M ). Then

w(M ) g(M )



qr - 1 qr-1(q -

1) .

Moreover, equality holds if and only if w is constant.

ON THE COGIRTH OF BINARY MATROIDS

Proof. We prove the inequality by induction on r. It is trivial when r = 1 and is true for r = 2 by Lemma 3.1, so suppose r  3. Let C be a cocircuit of M of weight g(M ) and let H be the complementary hyperplane to C
in M . Choose Z as a maximum-weight hyperplane of H. Then, letting Y
be the complement of Z in H, we have

(3.5)

w(M ) g(M )

=

w(C  )

+ w(Y ) w(C  )

+

w(Z )

=

1

+

w(Y ) + w(C

w(Z )

)

.

Observe that the weighted contraction of Z from M is isomorphic to P2 so, by the inequality for r = 2, we get that

w(M /Z ) g (M /Z )



q

+ q

1.

Now, since C is also a minimum-weight cocircuit of M/Z, we rewrite this inequality as

(3.6)

w(Y ) + w(C) w(C  )



q

+ q

1.

It follows that qw(Y )  w(C). Substituting into (3.5), we obtain

(3.7)

w(M ) g(M )



1

+

1 q

·

w(Y ) + w(Y

w(Z ) )

.

Finally, the hyperplane H is isomorphic to Pr-1, and our choice of Z makes Y a minimum-weight cocircuit of H. Thus, by induction,

(3.8)

w(Y ) + w(Z) w(Y )



qr-1 - 1 qr-2(q - 1)

.

Substituting (3.8) into (3.7) gives the desired inequality. One easily checks that, when w is constant,

(3.9)

w(M ) g(M )

=

qr - 1 qr-1(q -

1) .

We now use induction on r to prove that the elements of M have the same
weight when (3.9) holds. When r = 1, this is trivial, and Lemma 3.1 handles
the rank-2 case.
Suppose r  3. Since (3.9) holds, equality holds in (3.6) and (3.8). It
follows from the latter using the induction assumption that the weight func-
tion w on E(M ) is constant on the hyperplane H of M . From the former,
we deduce that, in M/Z, every point has equal weight. It follows that every hyperplane H of M containing Z has the same weight. Hence the cocircuit E(M ) - H has the same weight as C. Replacing H by H, we deduce that w is constant on the elements of H. Letting H range over all of the
hyperplanes of M containing Z, we deduce that w is constant on E(M ).
