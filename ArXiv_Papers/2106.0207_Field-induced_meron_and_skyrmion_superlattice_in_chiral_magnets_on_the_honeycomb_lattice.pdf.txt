I. INTRODUCTION
Magnetic skyrmions[1, 2] are localized topological spin textures corresponding to highly stable particle-like excitations, which have triggered enormous interest due to their significant potential for spintronics applications. The most mechanism of skyrmion formation is the competition between Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction [3, 4] and ferromagnetic exchange interaction with an external field. The DM interaction arises from the relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the presence of broken inversion symmetry, such as in chiral magnets (MnSi, FeGe, Fe1-xCoxSi, Cu2OSeO3, etc) [5­12], the metallic ferromagnet/paramagnet bilayers or bulks with artificial DM interaction [13­17], ultra-cold systems with synthetic SOC [18­26], which have been researched extensively theoretically and experimentally.
In a skyrmion, whole magnetic moments swirl from the south pole at the core to the north pole at the perimeter, encompassing a sphere. Similar to skyrmions, meron is another topological spin texture, which encompasses only half of the sphere and carries a one-half topological charge [27­30]. Merons, regarding as half-skyrmions, also have significant potential for spintronics applications. Moreover, recent observations of merons [31­36] have further raised the theoretical issue on the parameter regimes on which all these different kinds of topological texture emerge [37­40]. Merons and skyrmions, and the structural transitions of their lattices, are expected to be realized under the condition of increased magnetic anisotropy, which has been discovered by recent observation [34]. The lattice forms of merons have been observed

experimentally, however, the fully meron superlattice has not been reported in previous studies.
Here we study further the lattice forms of merons and skyrmions. We study a classical spin model including DM interaction, easy-axis, and in-plane magnetic anisotropies via Monte Carlo simulations. This model could be derived from the system of a two-component bosonic model with a synthetic SOC in the strong coupling limit, where the SOC could induce both the DM interaction and the symmetric off-diagonal interaction [41­44]. The results demonstrate the emergence of different sizes of spiral phases, skyrmion superlattice (SkL) and vortex superlattice (VL) in absence of magnetic field, furthered the emergence of field-induced meron superlattice (ML), incommensurate skyrmion superlattice (IC-SkL), and zvortex superlattice (Z-VL). Most of all, we give the simulated evolution of the spin textures driven by the magnetic field, which could further reveal the effect of the magnetic field for inducing ML and SkL. These rich varieties of topological spin textures and their lattice forms should stimulate further investigation of emergent electromagnetic properties.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we start from the bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice with a synthetic SOC. In the strong coupling limit, we derive the spin model with DM interaction, easy-axis and in-plane magnetic anisotropies. We also introduce the details about the Monte Carlo method and how to characterize different spin configurations. In Sec. III, we give the simulation results and phase diagram of the ground state in absence of magnetic field (see Fig. 2). In Sec. IV, we give phase diagrams with the magnetic field (see Fig. 3) corresponding to different easy-axis anisotropy. In Sec. V, we give the simulated evolution of typical phases in response to the magnetic field, revealing the effect of magnetic field for inducing ML and SkL. In Sec. VI, we give our discussions and conclusions.

II. MODEL AND METHOD

A. model

The low-energy behavior of bosons on the honeycomb lattice with a synthetic SOC can be described with the following Hamiltonian:

H^boson = -t

c^iRij c^j + H.c. + H^U ,

ij

Rij  exp [iA · (ri - rj)] ,

H^U

=

U 2

n^i (n^i - 1) + U

n^in^i, (1)

i

i

where the first term in H^boson describes the hopping term between nearest-neighbor sites, with t representing the hopping amplitude and c^i (c^i) is the creation (annihilation) operator at site i, with subscripts  and 
representing two internal hyperfine states of bosons. The
A = (y, -x, 0) in matrix Rij is a non-Abelian gauge field by the bosons, which is the well-known Rashba term. The second term H^U describes on-site interactions between bosons, where U is intracomponent interaction and U is the intercomponent one. n^i = c^i c^i is the boson number operator with spin  at site i.
Such a Hamiltonian has been widely studied on one-
dimensional chain and two-dimensional square lattice
system. Especially, in the deep Mott insulating region, it
can be approximated [21­25] as a spin model with DM in-
teraction, easy-axis and in-plane magnetic anisotropies, with S^i =  c^i ^ c^i the pseudo-spin operators, with ^ Pauli matrix and  = x, y, z. A variety of mag-
netic structures including spirals, skyrmions, and vortex
phases were revealed via Monte Carlo simulations.
At unit filling and in the strong coupling limit U/t 1, to the order O t2/U , we obtain the effective low-energy
spin Hamiltonian:

H^spin = J {J0Si · Sj + Dij · (Si × Sj )

+J (Siz)2,

i

J = - 4t2/U, J0 = cos 2,

Dij = sin 2(z × rij ), Ac = 2 sin2 ,

(2)

where the first term is the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg exchange J0. The second term is DM interaction, which is anisotropic antisymmetric interaction. SOC also induces another anisotropic exchange interaction, Ac term, which is symmetry-allowed even in the presence of inversion symmetry. On the square lattice, the Ac term includes only a symmetric diagonal compass term. However, on the honeycomb lattice, the Ac term includes a symmetric diagonal compass term and an extra symmetric off-diagonal term due to the lattice anisotropy, corresponding to the in-plane magnetic anisotropy. The last

term in H^spin is easy-axis anisotropy ( > 0), which is derived from intercomponent interaction U between

bosons.

We study on a honeycomb lattice with L × L (L = 60)

unit cells placed in xy-plane, each unit cell contains two

sites, colored with blue and red points shown in Fig. 1.

We set the lattice constant a = 1 and the magnitude of

the spins is fixed by the normalization condition |Si| = 1. The periodic boundary conditions are imposed. Due to

the anisotropy of the honeycomb lattice, there are three

types (1, 0),

of rij rij =

pointing from blue site

(-1/2,

 3/2)

and

rij

to red one: 

rij

=

(-1/2, - 3/2) and

the three types of DM vectors (D, D, D ) are shown

with green arrows. We use the convention Dij ·(Si ×Sj)

in which the first spin in the cross product Si is always on

the sublattice color with blue. The lattice is constructed

from different sets of primitive vectors (a1, a2) shown with yellow arrows in Fig.1.

FIG. 1. Sketch of the honeycomb lattice, with the primitive vectors a1, a2, and D, D, D correspond to the DM vectors in ,  and  bonds, respectively.
B. Monte Carlo method
To reveal the true classical ground states of H^spin in Eq. (2), we begin with paralleling-annealing Monte Carlo (MC) simulation on 40 replicas, with temperature T /|J| ranging from 0.001 to 1.0. For each replica, we sample it with a combination of heat-bath and over-relaxation methods. A whole MC step consists of a single heatbath sweep and subsequent 10 over-relaxation sweeps over the entire lattice. We perform 2 × 105 MC steps per replica, then, we copy out the spin configuration from the lowest-T replica and sample it with a combination of zero-temperature heat-bath and over-relaxation method to obtain the ground states. The zero-temperature heatbath sampling is simply aligning the spins according to

their local fields:

Due to several competing states, we start from 20 different initial configurations to obtain the correct classical ground states. Such methods for systems with complicated ground states were also used in Ref.[23].

C. Characterization of spin configurations

From the magnetic configurations of ground states, we compute the spin structure factors given by:

1 Fk = N

Si · Sj eik·(ri-rj ),

(5)

ij

which is one of key characterizes to identify magnetic phases.
For the topological number, we adopt the definition on lattice version induced by Berg[45, 46]. Firstly, we divide the entire lattice into elementary triangles. Then we calculate the solid angle l for each triangle l through all three spins (S1, S2, S3) located at its vertices:

e il 2

=

1 + S1 · S2 + S2 · S3 + S3 · S1 + iS1 · (S2 × S3) ,

2(1 + S1 · S2)(1 + S2 · S3)(1 + S3 · S1)

(6)

with   (-2, 2), and the topological number can

be obtained as: Qtopo = l l/4. For elementary skyrmions and merons, the topological number |Qtopo|
equals to 1 and 1/2, respectively[34].

We also calculate the vector chirality chi for each triangle:

where three spins Si, S2 and S3 are chosen anti-clockwise on the triangle.

III. PHASE DIAGRAM OF GROUND STATES
In this section, by using the MC simulation, we obtain the ground states properties of H^spin in Eq. (2), with tuning the strength of SOC  and the easy-axis anisotropy . We get the following phases characterized by the spin structure factors Fk. In Fig. 2(a), we give the phase diagram of ground states, which includes ferromagnetic phase (Z-FM), antiferromagnetic phase (Z-AFM), spiral

3
 phases and two topologicalphases (3×3 SkL and 3× 3 VL). The 3 × 3 SkL and 3 × 3 VL phases mean the 3 × 3 unit cell skyrmion superlattice and 3 × 3 unit cell vortex superlattice, respectively. In Fig. 2(b)-(d), we give the real-space spin configurations of spiral phases, 3 × 3 SkL and 3 × 3 VL phases. In Fig. 2(e)-(f), we give the spin structure factors of two topological phases. The details of different phases are as follows.
A. Z-FM phase and Z-AFM phase
Firstly, we introduce the ferromagnetic phase and antiferromagnetic phase, viz Z-FM and Z-AFM phases in Fig. 2(a), which result from the ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic exchange interaction and easy-axis anisotropy. Z-FM phase is the ferromagnetic phase where spins orient along the ±z axis. The spin structure factor exhibits a peak at k = (0, 0), which is the  point in the first Brillouin region. Analogously, the Z-AFM phase is the antiferromagnetic phase where spins pointing along with the ±z axis.The spin structure factor exhibits peaks at (±2/3, ±2 3/3) and (±4/3, 0), which are the vertices of the second Brillouin region.
At  = 0 and  = 0, the H^spin just recover the classical isotropic Heisenberg model, which has a FM ground state with U(1) symmetry. When  > 0, easy-axis anisotropy results in spins orient along with the ±z axis, which leads to the Z-FM ground state.
At  is close to 0.5, DM interaction is almost to zero, the H^spin includes the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange, Ac term, and easy-axis anisotropy. When  > 0.2, easy-axis anisotropy increases dramatically, which leads to a Z-AFM ground state.
B. Spiral phases
The largest region in the phase diagram is spiral phases, which mainly result from the DM interaction. Spiral phases are coplanar states, where spins are all parallel at a plane and their direction rotates by a constant angle from one plane to a neighboring plane along the helical axis. There are several different periods of spiral phases, we describe these spiral phases in detail as follows.
Firstly, when  and  are small, the DM interaction is very weak and the ferromagnetic exchange interaction is very strong, which leads to the IC-Spiral phase. ICSpiral are incommensurate spiral states, which may have several sizes of spiral states. Due to the size effect and difficulty of numerical calculation for this model, we do not give a clear real-space spin configuration of IC-Spiral phase.
As  increases, the emergence of N  × 1 spiral phases in phase diagram. N  × 1 spiral phases are different sizes of N  × 1 unit cell spiral states, where N  = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and N  decreased with  increasing. The real-space spin

 spin structure factors are k1 = (-2/3N , 23/3N ), (2/3N , -2 3/3N ); k2 = (2/3N , 2 3/3N ), (-2/3N , -2 3/3N ); and k3 = (±4/3N , 0).

C. Topological phases
1. 3 × 3 skyrmion superlattice
At  is close to 0.2 and  < 0.5, an extremely strong competition between DM interaction and Ac term has arisen, which leads to a non-coplanar topological phase, the 3 × 3 skyrmion superlattice (SkL) phase.
3 × 3 SkL is a non-coplanar state, where the spins form a 3 × 3 unit cell skyrmion superlattice. In Fig. 2(c), we give the real-space spin configuration of the 3 × 3 SkL. The elementary skyrmion contains a large hexagon with 3 × 3 unit cell. In the hexagon of 3 × 3 unit cell, a spin with negative Sz magnetization at the core, spins from the core lie in the xy plane rotating 2 and six outermost spins with positive Sz magnetization. The structure factor of 3 × 3 SkL phase has peaks at (±2/9, ±2 3/9) and (±4/9, 0) shown in Fig. 2(e).
We also calculated the topological number of the 3 × 3 SkL phase by Eq. (6). The elementary skyrmion was marked with the dashed line in Fig. 2(c), where the topological number Qtopo = -1 for each skyrmion.
 2. 3 × 3 vortex superlattice
At  is close to 0.5, DM interaction is almost to zero and the Ac term reaches its maximum. When  is close to 0, the spins coplanar in xy plane because of the Ac term, which lead to another topological spin texture, the
3 × 3 vortex superlattice (VL) phase. 
3 × 3 VL is a coplanar state, with spins in the xy plane form a 3 × 3 unit cell vortex superlattice, where the real-space spin configuration is shown in Fig. 2(d). The spins wind anti-clockwise 2 around each hexagon corresponding to chi equal 1. The structure factor has peaks at (±2/3, ±2 3/9) and (0, ±4 3/9) in Fig. 2(f), which are the vertexes of the first Brillouin region.

IV. PHASE DIAGRAM WITH MAGNETIC FIELD
In this section, we induce the out-of-plane magnetic field in the H^spin. We obtain different phase diagrams corresponding to different easy-axis anisotropy by using the Monte Carlo simulation. Three phase diagrams (see Fig. 3) are correspond to different easy-axis anisotropy ( = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8), which are marked with dashed lines in Fig. 2(a). Most of the phases in Fig. 2(a) are still stable when inducing the magnetic field. It is wondrous that three field-induce topological phases have emerged, incommensurate skyrmion superlattice (IC-SkL), 2 × 2 meron superlattice (2 × 2 ML) and 3 × 3 z-vortex superlattice ( 3 × 3 Z-VL), which have not been focused on in previous work, especially the 2 × 2 ML phase. We investigate these new topological phases in detail as follows.
A. Incommensurate skyrmion superlattice
In the phase diagram of ground states (Fig. 2(a)), the IC-Spiral states and larger size of spiral states are not stable when inducing the magnetic field. As the magnetic field increases, the IC-Spiral states and large-size spiral states are superseded by incommensurate skyrmion superlattice (IC-SkL) phases gradually.
IC-SkL phases are non-coplanar states, which have incommensurate skyrmions and the number of skyrmions change with the different parameters. In Fig. 4(a)-(b), we give the spin configurations of IC-SkL states corresponding to different parameter  and the spin texture of skyrmion with negative Sz magnetization at the core, and in-plane spin component pointing radially to the core, where the topological number Qtopo = -1 for per skyrmion. From Fig. 4(a) to Fig. 4(b), the  increases from 0.10 to 0.13, an increase in the magnitude of the spin wave vector, which leads to the number of skyrmions increases and the size of skyrmion lattice decreases.

B. 2 × 2 meron superlattice
We get the 2 × 2 ML in the region of 2 × 1 spiral phase when inducing the out-of-plane magnetic field, 2 × 2 ML is another non-coplanar state, where the spins form a 2 × 2 unit cell meron. The magnetic anisotropy leads to the transformation from the 2 × 1 spiral phase to 2 × 2 ML phase and the 2 × 2 ML phase is favored by the competition between Ac term, DM interaction, and magnetic anisotropy.
In Fig. 4(c), we give the real-space spin configuration of the 2 × 2 ML phase. The whole meron contains a large hexagon with 2 × 2 unit cell. In the hexagon of 2 × 2 unit cell, the in-plane spin component rotating 2 in the center hexagon and six vertices of the outer hexagon spins point down or up. The structure factor of the 2 × 2 ML phase has peaks at (±/3, ± 3/3) and (±2/3, 0).
We also calculated the topological number of the 2 × 2 ML phase by Eq. (6). The whole meron is marked with the dashed line in Fig. 4(c), where the topological number Qtopo = -1/2 for per meron.
 C. 3 × 3 z-vortex superlattice
  Weget the 3 × 3 Z-VL phase in the region between
3 × 3 VL phase and Z-AFM phase with the magnetic field, which mostly results from the competition between Ac term and magnetic anisotropy. The Ac term is favorable to form the VL phase, whereas, with the inducing

of magnetic anisotropy, the out-of-plane components of spins appear ferromagnetic order.
3 × 3 Z-VL phase is also a non-coplanar state, where the in-plane components of spins form a 3 × 3 unit cell VL state and the out-of-plane components of spins appear ferromagnetic order. The spins wind anticlockwise 2 around each hexagon, where the real-space spin configuration is shown in Fig. 4(d). The structure factor of 3 × 3 Z-VL phase is similar to 3 × 3 VL phase,which also has peaks at (±2/3, ±2 3/9) and (0, ±4 3/9). However, there has an extra peak at (0, 0), corresponding to the ferromagnetic order of outof-plane components.
V. FIELD-INDUCED MERON AND SKYRMION SUPERLATTICE
In this section, we give the hysteresis loops and dm/dH (see Fig. 5) of typical 3 × 3 SkL and 2 × 1 spiral phases. By simulating the evolution of these two phases in response to the out-of-plane magnetic field, we further reveal the effect of magnetic field for inducing different sizes of meron and skyrmion superlattice. The evolution of the spin textures of these phases in response to the outof-plane magnetic field is depicted in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, which counts several phases and metastable states. The magnetization curves of other phase regions are depicted in Appendix A.
The magnetization processes in 3 × 3 SkL phase are great complex, which results from the intense competition between DM interaction, Ac term and magnetic anisotropy. The magnetization process of 3 × 3 SkL phase is shown in Fig. 6, where the magnetic field is from H/|J|=1.5 to -1.5.
In Fig. 6(a), we give the mean topological number for per 3 × 3 unit cell of different phases in the magnetization processes of 3 × 3 SkL phase. In the magnetization

processes of 3 × 3 SkL phase, when the magnetic field decreases, polarized states evolve into 3 × 3 ML, form metastable 3 × 3 SkL gradually, and then form 3 × 1 spiral state, which is shown in Fig. 6(b)-(e). When the magnetic field is close to zero, 3×1 spiral state evolve into 3 × 3 SkL state, where the emergence of metastable state including spiral and skyrmions shown in Fig. 6(e)-(g). When the magnetic field goes from positive to negative near zero, the topological number of 3 × 3 SkL change opposite in sign shown in Fig. 6(g)-(h). As the magnetic

field increases, the 3 × 3 SkL phase firstly has the continuous deformation of the spin texture in response to the change of magnetic field, where the total topological number do not change. Then the 3 × 3 SkL state evolves into 3×1 spiral state. A decrease in the magnitude of the spiral wave vector, which leads to the 3 × 1 spiral state evolve into 3 × 3 ML, a constriction of merons and the number of merons decreases, finally end up with polarized states, shown in Fig. 6(h)-(l).
We also give the simulated evolution of the 2 × 1 spi-

In Fig. 7(a), we give the mean topological number for per 2×2 unit cell of different phases in the magnetization processes of 2 × 1 Spiral phase. When the magnetic field decreases, polarized states evolve into a metastable state including 2 × 2 ML state and FM state, and then form 2 × 2 ML phase with Qtopo = -1/2 for per 2 × 2 unit cell, which is shown in Fig. 7(b)-(d). When the magnetic field is close to zero, there has been 2 × 1 spiral state (Fig. 7(e)). As the magnetic field increases, a decrease in the magnitude of the spiral wave vector, which leads to the 2 × 1 spiral states evolve into 2 × 2 ML, a constriction of merons and the number of merons decreases gradually, then end up with polarized states, which is shown in Fig. 7(f)-(h).
VI. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

atoms by inducing the magnetic field. Moreover, we obtain the hysteresis loops of different phases, which could provide guidance to distinguish the different phases in experimental observations.
In conclusion, we study a classical spin model for chiral magnets that include DM interaction, easy-axis, and inplane magnetic anisotropies on the honeycomb lattice via the Monte Carlo annealing method. We obtain several different sizes of spiral phases and novel topological spin textures, such as 3 × 3 SkL phase, and 3 × 3VL phase in absence of the magnetic field. As the magnetic field induced, we obtain new topological spin textures, IC-SkL phase, 2 × 2 ML phase, and 3 × 3 Z-VL phase. In particular, we give the simulated evolution of the typical 3 × 3 SkL phase and 2 × 1 Spiral phase in response to the out-of-plane magnetic field. By simulating the evolution of these phases in response to magnetic fields, we reveal that the magnetic field could induce different sizes of meron and skyrmion superlattice. Overall, our results of these topological spin textures and their lattice forms should stimulate further investigation of emergent electromagnetic properties.

In this paper, we find that the different sizes of fieldinduced meron superlattice are all fully meron superlattice, which has not been reported in previous studies. Based on our results, these novel topological spin textures could be reproduced in real chiral magnets and ultra-cold

Appendix A: Magnetization curve
In this section, we give the hysteresis loops of different phase region in the phase diagram of ground states, further reveal the effect of magnetic field for inducing different sizes of meron and skyrmion superlattice.
1. Magnetization curves of Z-FM phase, Z-AFM phase and 3 × 3 VL phase
Firstly, we give the hysteresis loops in the Z-FM phase (Fig. 8(b)), where the significant magnetic hysteresis in the magnetization process of Z-FM phase.

We find that here appears Z-VL states in the hysteresis loop of Z-AFM phase and 3 × 3 VL phase, which lead to the oblique lines in the magnetization curve of Fig. 8(d) and Fig. 8(f). The platform near zero field in Fig. 8(d) is the Z-AFM state, which is the ground state in absence of field. In Z-AFM and 3 × 3 VL phase regions, DM interaction is close to zero and compass term reaches its maximum, which leads to the vortex structure in xy plane. As the magnetic field increases, the enhanced polarization Field in Sz leads to the Z-VL states, whcih is corresponding to the platform in Fig. 8(c) and Fig. 8(e).
2. Magnetization curves of Spiral phases
In Fig. 9, we give the hysteresis loops in the regions of different spiral phases. The magnetization processes in different spiral phases are great difference but there are internal connections, which mostly result from the intense competition between DM interaction and magnetic anisotropy. The hysteresis loops of different spiral

phases are presented respectively and these magnetization processes are discussed as follows, which indicate the transformation between meron and skyrmion superlattice.
The magnetization processes in 6 × 1 and 5 × 1 spiral phases are very similar. There have been lots of metastable states domain wall that IC-SkL order and spiral order coexist when the magnetic field decreases. As the magnetic field increases, IC-SkL states formed and a constriction of skyrmions, then end up with polarized states.
The magnetization processes in 4 × 1 spiral phase are extremely complicated. When the magnetic field decreases, polarized states evolve into metastable states that merons and skyrmions coexist. When the magnetic field is close to zero, there has been 4×1 spiral states. As the magnetic field increases, a decrease in the magnitude of the spiral wave vector, which leads to the 4 × 1 spiral states evolve into 4 × 4 meron lattice, a constriction of merons and the number of merons decreases gradually, then end up with polarized states.
The magnetization processes in 3 × 1 spiral phase is similar to 3 × 3 SkL phase. When the magnetic field decreases, polarized states evolve into 3 × 3 meron su-

perlattice, form metastable 3 × 3 skyrmion superlattice gradually, then form 3 × 1 spiral state near zero field. As the magnetic field increases, a decrease in the magnitude of the spiral wave vector, which leads to the 3 × 1 spiral states evolve into 3 × 3 meron lattice, a constriction of merons and the number of merons decreases gradually, then end up with polarized states.
The magnetization processes in 2 × 1 spiral phase are extremely complicated. When the magnetic field de-

creases, polarized states evolve into metastable state that merons and FM state coexist, then form 2 × 2 ML state. When the magnetic field is close to zero, there has been 2 × 1 spiral states. As the magnetic field increases, a decrease in the magnitude of the spiral wave vector, which lead to the 2 × 1 spiral states evolve into 2 × 2 meron lattice, a constriction of merons and the number of merons decreases gradually, then end up with polarized states.
