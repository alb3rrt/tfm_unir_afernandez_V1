## Abstract

We study the Z3 gauge theory with fermions on the quantum computer using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm with IBM QISKit software. Using up to 9 qubits we are able to obtain accurate results for the ground state energy. Introducing nonzero chemical potential we are able to determine the Equation of State (EOS) for finite density on the quantum computer. We discuss possible realizations of quantum advantage for this system over classical computers with regards to finite density simulations and the fermion sign problem.
