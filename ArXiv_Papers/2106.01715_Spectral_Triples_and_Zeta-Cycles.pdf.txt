Abstract We exhibit very small eigenvalues of the quadratic form associated to the Weil explicit formulas restricted to test functions whose support is within a fixed interval with upper bound S. We show both numerically and conceptually that the associated eigenvectors are obtained by a simple arithmetic operation of finite sum using prolate spheroidal wave functions associated to the scale S. Then we use these functions to condition the canonical spectral triple of the circle of length L=2 Log(S) in such a way that they belong to the kernel of the perturbed Dirac operator. We give numerical evidence that, when one varies L, the low lying spectrum of the perturbed spectral triple resembles the low lying zeros of the Riemann zeta function. We justify conceptually this result and show that, for each eigenvalue, the coincidence is perfect for the special values of the length L of the circle for which the two natural ways of realizing the perturbation give the same eigenvalue. This fact is tested numerically by reproducing the first thirty one zeros of the Riemann zeta function from our spectral side, and estimate the probability of having obtained this agreement at random, as a very small number whose first fifty decimal places are all zero. The theoretical concept which emerges is that of zeta cycle and our main result establishes its relation with the critical zeros of the Riemann zeta function and with the spectral realization of these zeros obtained by the first author.

1. Introduction

When contemplating the low lying zeros of the Riemann zeta function one is tempted

to

speculate

that

they

may

form

the

spectrum

of

an

operator

of

the

form

1 2

+ iD

with

D = D self-adjoint, and to search for the geometry provided by a spectral triple1 for

which D is the Dirac operator. In this paper we give the construction of a spectral triple

(, k) = (A(), H(), D(, k)) which admits, as shown for small values of  > 1, a

spectrum

of

1 2

+ iD

very

similar

to

the

low

lying

zeros

of

the

Riemann

zeta

function

(this fact is exemplified in Figure 1, for 2 = 10.5). More precisely, the spectral triple

(, k) depends on  and also on the choice of an integer k < 22, moreover for a fixed

value of k the positive non-zero eigenvalues n(D(, k)) arranged in increasing order, vary continuously with . A striking fact (discovered numerically at first) is that for special values of  the dependence of n(D(, k)) on the value of k (close enough to 22) disappears (see Figure 2 for the case n = 1), while the common value of these n(D(, k)) coincides exactly with the imaginary part of the n-th zero of the Riemann zeta function! This means that the qualitative resemblance of spectra as in Figure 1 yields in fact a sharp coincidence in some range: by varying  in the interval 5  2  16.5, and determining the coinciding eigenvalues up to n = 31 one produces 31 numbers in amazing agreement with the full collection of values of the first 31 zeros of the zeta function (see Figure 3; incidentally notice that the probability of obtaining such agreement from a random choice is of the order of 10-50 ).

The main goal of this paper is to provide a theoretical explanation for this numerical "coincidence" and relate it to the spectral realization of the zeros of zeta given in [3]. The new theoretical concept that emerges is that of a -cycle.

A. Connes and C. Consani

In Section 6.1 we explain how to define scale invariant Riemann sums for functions
defined on [0, ) with vanishing integral. This technique is implemented in the definition
of the linear map µE : S0ev  L2(C)
from the Schwartz space S0ev of even functions, f, f (0) = 0, with vanishing integral, to square integrable functions on the circle C = R+/µZ of length L = log µ. The key notion is then provided by the following

Definition 1.1. A -cycle is a circle C of length L = log µ such that the subspace µE(S0ev) is not dense in the Hilbert space L2(C).

It turns out that likewise for closed geodesics, -cycles are stable under finite covers,
and if C is a -cycle of length L, then the n-fold cover of C is a -cycle of length nL, for
any positive integer n > 0. By construction, the subspace µE(S0ev)  L2(C) is invariant under the group of rotations of the circle which appears here from the scaling action of the multiplicative group R+ on C = R+/µZ. The main result of this paper is the following

Theorem 1.1. (i) The spectrum of the action of the multiplicative group R+ on the orthogonal of µE(S0ev) in L2(C) is formed by imaginary parts of zeros of the Riemann

zeta function on the critical line.

(ii)

Let

be

such

that



(

then

any

circle

of

length

an

integral

multiple

of

2/s is a -cycle, and the spectrum of the action of R+ on (µE(S0ev)) contains s.

The ad-hoc Sobolev spaces used in [3] to provide the spectral realization of zeros of zeta are here replaced by the canonical Hilbert space L2(C) of square integrable functions. Moreover, Theorem 1.1 provides the theoretical explanation for the above coincidence of spectral values. Indeed, the special values of 2 = µ = exp L at which the k dependence of the eigenvalue n(D(, k)) disappear, signal that the related circle of length L is a cycle and that n(D(, k)) is in its spectrum. This explains why the low lying part of the spectrum of the spectral triple (, k) possesses a tantalizing resemblance with the low lying zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Indeed, the special values of the length (L) of the circle for which the coinciding n(D(, k)) occur, form a part of the arithmetic progression of multiples of 2/n, where n is the imaginary part of the n-th zero of the zeta function. This forces the graphs of the functions n(D(µ1/2, k)) to pass through points of the form (exp(2m/n), n) (as in Figure 2) which entails that the low lying spectrum of D(, k) (for k  22) mimics the low lying zeros of the zeta function. The spectral triple (, k) is a finite rank perturbation of the Dirac operator on a circle of length log µ = 2 log  and involves, as a key ingredient, classical prolate spheroidal wave functions [13, 12, 11]. These functions are used to define a finite dimensional subspace (of dimension k) of the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on the circle of length 2 log , and the operator D(, k) is then canonically obtained from the operator of ordinary differentiation D0() to insure that its kernel contains the above finite dimensional subspace.

Spectral triples and -cycles

A priori, there seems to be no relation between the construction of the spectral triple (, k) and the Riemann zeta function: in Section 3 we explain how we stumbled on (, k) while continuing our investigations of the Weil quadratic form restricted to test functions with support in a fixed interval. The Riemann-Weil explicit formulas give a concrete and finite expression of the semi-local Weil quadratic form (see Section 2) which is suitable for numerical exploration since it only involves primes less than, say, 2. By semi-local Weil quadratic form we mean the restriction QW of the sesquilinear form

QW (f, g) :=

f (s¯)g(s)

1/2+isZ

(1.1)

on test functions f, g whose support is contained in the interval [-1, ]  R+. In (1.1), Z is the set of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function and Fourier transform is defined on Cc(R+) by

f (s) = Fµ(f )(s) := f (u)u-isdu.
R+

(1.2)

One knows that the positivity of the Weil quadratic form QW for all  implies the Riemann Hypothesis (RH), and in case RH holds, QW is known to be strictly positive. In [14], the positivity was shown to hold for  = 2 using numerical analysis. In Section 2 we test numerically this positivity for larger values of , showing (§2.2) that the contribution from the archimedean place alone ceases to be positive in the upper part of the interval log(2)  [log 2 - 0.2, log 2 + 0.2]  [0.493, 0.893], while the positivity is restored by
adding the contribution of the prime 2. This latter contribution depends explicitly on
p = 2 in a form Wp which in fact can be evaluated for any real number p  2 (i.e. close to but not equal to 2). We show (§2.3) that by requiring positivity one restricts the allowed values of p to an interval of size  10-3 around p = 2, and in §2.4 we display that when 2 grows past a prime power and one ignores its contribution, the quadratic form QW fails to remain positive. This fact is displayed up to 2  7. One striking numerical result is described in §2.5, where we report numerical evidence that as  increases the corresponding operator in H() := L2([-1, ], du) admits a finite number of extremely small positive eigenvalues. For instance, we find that when 2 = 11 the smallest positive eigenvalue is 2.389 × 10-48. The corresponding eigenfunctions are graphically reported
in Figures 22, 23, 24.
Section 3 explains conceptually the presence of these extremely small positive eigenvalues
and there we also give an excellent approximation of the related eigenfunctions. The
theoretical reason for the presence of these extremely small eigenvalues springs from the
fact that the radical of the Weil quadratic form contains the range of the map E of [3], that is defined on the codimension two subspace S0ev of even Schwartz functions fulfilling f (0) = f (0) = 0 by

E(f )(x) := x1/2 f (nx) , f  S0ev.
n>0

(1.3)

A. Connes and C. Consani

Even though RH implies that QW is strictly positive, and thus that its radical is {0}, by making use of (1.3), one can nevertheless construct functions g with support in [-1, ]
which are in the "near radical" of the Weil quadratic form i.e. fulfill QW(g) g 2. More precisely, if the support of the even function f  S0ev is contained in the interval [-, ]  R, the support of E(f ) is contained in (0, ]  R+. On the other hand, the
Poisson formula

E(f )(x) = E(f )(x-1) , f  S0ev

(1.4)

shows that the support of E(f ) is contained in [-1, ) provided the support of the even
function f is contained in the interval [-, ]  R. The obstruction to obtain an element
E(f ) of the radical of QW is the equality P  P = {0}, where P and P are the cutoff projections in the Hilbert space L2(R)ev of square integrable even functions (the projection P is given by the multiplication by the characteristic function of the interval [-, ]  R, the projection P is its conjugate by the Fourier transform FeR ). The seminal work of Slepian and Pollack [13, 12, 11] on band limited functions then shows that while
P  P = {0}, the angle operator between these two projections admits a finite number 1 + (2)  22 of extremely small non zero eigenvalues and that the corresponding
eigenfunctions are the prolate spheroidal wave functions

m,(x) := PS 2m,0

22, x 

,

m  (2)  22.

By construction, each m, is a function on the interval [-, ] that one extends by 0 outside that interval. Its Fourier transform FeR (m,) restricted to the interval [-, ], is equal to mm, where the scalar m is very close to (-1)m provided that m is less than (2)  22. After taking care of the two conditions f (0) = f (0) = 0, the restriction of E(f ) to the interval [-1, ] gives rise to a function which we call a "prolate
vector", and on which QW takes non-zero, but extremely small values. This fact is verified concretely in Section 3 where we compare the eigenvectors of the Weil quadratic
form QW associated to its smallest eigenvalues with the orthogonalisation of the prolate vectors obtained using the technique outlined above, from the prolate spheroidal wave
functions.
The construction of the spectral triple (, k) is carried out in Section 4. Even though
this construction is motivated by the results of Section 3 on the near radical of the Weil
quadratic form QW, the technique involved only uses the prolate vectors without any reference to QW. Using the first k + 2 prolate functions, one obtains a k-dimensional subspace of L2([-1, ], du) L2(R+/2Z, du), then one lets (, k) be the associated orthogonal projection. By definition, the spectral triple (, k) = (A(), H(), D(, k))
is given by the action by multiplication of the algebra of smooth functions A() := C(R+/2Z) on H() := L2(R+/2Z, du), while the operator D(, k) is the finite rank perturbation

D(, k) := (1 - (, k))  D0  (1 - (, k)), D0 = -iuu

(1.5)

Spectral triples and -cycles

7

of the standard Dirac operator D0 = -iuu (with periodic boundary conditions when viewed in L2([-1, ], du) L2(R+/2Z)). We compute the low lying spectra of these spectral triples and find a neat resemblance with the low lying zeros of the Riemann zeta function, provided that k is sufficiently close to the largest allowed value (2). On
the other hand, since the eigenvalues n(D(, k)) vary with , one cannot expect that they reproduce exactly the n-th zero of the zeta function. The subtlety of the relation
is explained in Section 5, where we produce several criterions to recover the zeros of the
Riemann zeta function using the non-zero eigenvalues n(D(, k)). First we show that for k = 2 , the eigenvalues fulfill the inequality n(D(, k + 1))  n(D(, k)), then we prove (§5.1) that for certain values of  one has n(D(, k + 1)) n(D(, k)). When this happens and k is close enough to the upper bound (2), the common eigenvalue
coincides with the imaginary part of the n-th zero of the zeta function. This result is strengthened in §5.2, where we plot the evolution of the eigenvalues n(D(, k)), as functions of µ = 2, for fixed k, and find that several graphs coincide at the above special values of  as displayed in Figure 2. In §5.3 we find that the obtained special points in the (µ, n) plane fulfill the quantization condition

µin = 1.

This result suggests that for the above special values of  one has an eigenvector which is already an eigenvector of the unperturbed Dirac operator D0. In §5.4 we apply this criterion to select the special values of , and compute the 31 first zeros of the Riemann zeta function with the precision shown in Figure 3. The conceptual explanation of these experimental findings is Theorem 1.1 whose proof is developed in the final Section 6.

2. The semi-local Weil quadratic form
In this section we test numerically the positivity of the Weil quadratic form QW (f, g), in the semi local case, namely for test functions f, g with support in the interval [-1, ]. This investigation breaks down in two independent cases so that QW = QW+  QW-, according to the parity of f and g with respect to the symmetry operator u  u-1. Lemma 2.5 shows that for real test functions, the even functions do not interfere with the odd ones. Moreover by construction the positivity of QW depends on the length L = 2 log  of the support of the test functions. We define in (2.21) an orthonormal basis {n, n  Z} of the Hilbert space L2([-1, ]) formed by odd (for the symmetry u  u-1) real functions for n < 0, and by even real functions for n  0. The matrix (n, m) = QW (n, m) is the direct sum  = +  - of two infinite symmetric real matrices, each of which is expressed as a finite sum involving the archimedean contribution -WR, as well as the contribution -Wp from primes p less than µ = 2. The numerical tests consist in evaluating the eigenvalues of the very large portion of these matrices corresponding to indices n and m whose absolute values are  N . These computations give significant evidence that the increasing of large N does not alter substantially the lower part of the spectrum of (n, m). In §2.2 we find that the archimedean contribution -WR to the Weil quadratic form when taken separately, ends to be positive if computed in an interval

8

extending slightly beyond the value L = log 2 (Figure 6). However, the positivity is
restored after that value, and precisely in the interval log 2  L < log 3, by implementing
also the contribution of the prime p = 2, in terms of the related functional -W2. In §2.3 we report our numerical findings supplying evidence to the fact that the sign of QW is also sensitive to the replacement of -W2 by a functional -Wp whose definition uses the same formula as -W2 but replaces 2 with p, taken as a real variable in a small neighborhood of p = 2. Indeed the computations show that the positivity of the quadratic form fails if one considers real values of p outside an interval of size < 10-3 around 2. In §2.4 we report graphical evidence indicating how important is the contribution of each functional -Wp to preserve the positivity of the quadratic form, if the support of the test function stretches beyond a prime power pn. Finally, in §2.5 we display numerical evidence of the key fact that by suitably increasing the support of the test functions, the "even" and " odd" matrices ± admit a finite number of extremely small positive
eigenvalues. The theoretical discussion of this result is presented in section 3.

2.1. The matrix  = +  -
This subsection describes the choice of test functions used in this paper while performing the numerical computations. When viewed in Hilbert theoretic terms the restriction QW of the Weil quadratic form to functions with support in the interval [-1, ] is a lower bounded, lower semi-continuous quadratic form defined on the Hilbert space H := L2([-1, ], du) with values in (-, +]. We choose an orthonormal basis {n}nZ of H which is a core for QW and compute the eigenvalues of very large portions of the associated matrix QW (n, m) = (n, m).

2.1.1. Explicit formula. Following [1], one considers the class W of complex valued functions f on R+ which are continuous and with continuous derivative except at finitely many points where both f (x) and f (x) have at most a discontinuity of the first kind, and at which the value of f (x) and f (x) is defined as the average of the right and left limits. Moreover one assumes that for some  > 0 one has
f (x) = O(x), for x  0+, f (x) = O(x-1-), for x  +.

The Mellin transform of f  W is defined as


f~(s) := f (x)xs-1dx
0
Let f (x) := x-1f (x-1), then Weil's explicit formula takes the form

(2.1)





f~() = f (x)dx + f (x)dx - Wv(f ),

(2.2)

where the sum on the left hand side is over all complex zeros  of the Riemann zeta function, and the sum on the right hand side runs over all rational places v of Q. The

non-archimedean distributions Wp are defined as



Wp(f ) := (log p)

f (pm) + f (pm)

m=1

(2.3)

while the archimedean distribution is given by

WR(f ) := (log 4 + )f (1) +

f (x) + f (x) - f (1) x

x - x-1 .

(2.4)

The translation to (equivalent) formulas using the Fourier transform (in place of the Mellin transform) is done by implementing the automorphism 

f  1/2f = F, F (x) = x1/2f (x)

(2.5)

which respects the convolution product and satisfies the equalities (1/2f )(x) = x1/2f (x) = x-1/2f (x-1) = (1/2f )(x-1).

After taking complex conjugates,  is compatible with the natural involutions. For a rational place v, we set Wv(F ) := Wv(-1/2F ), then the above distributions Wp take the following form


Wp(F ) = (log p) p-m/2 F (pm) + F (p-m) .
m=1

(2.6)

Using the multiplicative version dx = dx/x of the Haar measure, the archimedean distribution WR becomes

WR(F ) := (log 4 + )F (1) +

2.1.2. The semi-local Weil quadratic form. The Weil quadratic form is now re-written as

QW (f, g) = (f   g), (F ) := F (i/2) + F (-i/2) - WR(F ) - Wp(F ) (2.8)
p

where F (s) := F (u)u-isdu denotes the Fourier transform of the function F . Moreover the functional W := -WR fulfills the following formula

with log (s), for (s) > 0, the branch of the log which is real for s real. By a lower bounded, lower semi-continuous (lsc) quadratic form q on a Hilbert space H we mean a lower semi-continuous map2 q : H  (-, +] which fulfills q() = ||2q() for all   C, the parallelogram law

q( + ) + q( - ) = 2q() + 2q()

and also an inequality of the form q()  -c  2 for all   H, reflecting the lower bound of q. The associated sesquilinear form (antilinear in the first variable) is given on the domain of q, Dom(q) := {  H | q() < } by

1 q(, ) := (q( + ) - q( - ) + iq(i + ) - iq(i - )) .

By a result of Kato (see [10], Theorem 2) such lower bounded quadratic forms correspond to lower bounded densely defined self-adjoint operators T  -c on H by the formula

q() + c  2 =

At the informal level this means that q(, ) =  | T  .

Proposition 2.1. Let  > 1. The following formula defines a lower bounded lower semi-continuous quadratic form QW : L2([-1, ], du)  (-, +]

QW(f, f ) :=

|f (t)|2 2t(t) dt + 2 2

f ( i )f¯(- i ) -

(n) f | V (n)f (2.11)

22

1<n2

where (n) is the von Mangoldt function and V (n) is the bounded self-adjoint operator in L2([-1, ], du) such that

f | V (n)g = n-1/2 (f   g)(n) + (f   g)(n-1) .

(2.12)

Proof. The function t(t) is even, lower bounded and of the order of O(log |t|) for

|t|  . This shows that the first term (Q(f ) =

|f

(t)|2

2t (t) 2

in

(2.11)

defines

a lower bounded, lower semi-continuous quadratic form Q on the Hilbert space

L2(R+, du). We view L2([-1, ], du) as the closed subspace of functions which van-

ish outside [-1, ]. The restriction of the quadratic form Q to L2([-1, ], du) is still

lower semi-continuous and lower bounded, moreover the domain {  L2([-1, ], du) |

2i.e. such that when n   one has q()  lim inf q(n)

Spectral triples and -cycles

Q(, ) < } is dense since it contains all smooth functions with support in (-1, ). Thus it remains to show that each of the remaining terms can be written in the form f | T g with T bounded and self-adjoint in L2([-1, ], du). One has

i f( ) =


f (u)u1/2du = h | f ,

h(u) := u1/2 , u  [-1, ].

Thus the term 2

f

(

i 2

)f¯(-

i 2

)

in (2.11) is of the form f | T f , where T is the sum of

the rank one operators T = |h h| + |h h|. Let us show that (2.12) defines a bounded

self-adjoint operator V (n) in L2([-1, ], du). One has

(f   g)(v) = f (vu-1)g(u)du = f (v-1u)g(u)du

so that by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality one derives |(f   g)(v)|  f g . This shows
that the equality (f g)(v) = |f Vvg| defines a bounded operator Vv in L2([-1, ], du). Moreover its adjoint is Vv = Vv-1 and thus V (n) is bounded and self-adjoint.

Lemma

2.2.

Let

 > 1,

and

U

 L2([-1, ], du)

be

the

function

i
U (u) := u log  .

Then

the space of Laurent polynomials C[U, U -1] is a core for the quadratic form QW.

Proof. Since all terms in (2.11) are bounded except for Q, it is enough to show that C[U, U -1] is a core for the quadratic form Q restricted to L2([-1, ], du). First note that the powers U n belong to the domain of Q since the Fourier transform of U n is
given by



U n(s) =

U n(u)u-isdu =

= 2 log (-1)n sin(s log ) (n - s log )-1 = O(1/|s|).

(2.13)

Thus the integral of |U n(s)|2t(t) is absolutely convergent and U n belongs to the domain of Q. Next, given   L2([-1, ], du) such that Q(, ) < , we want to show that for any > 0 there exists   C[U, U -1] such that (with -c the lower bound of Q)

(1 + c)  -  2 + Q( - ,  - ) < .

(2.14)

We switch from R+ to the additive group R (using the logarithm) and let L = 2 log  and

H = L2([-L/2, L/2])  L2(R). Under this change of variable the function U becomes

We first replace  by 1 with 1(x) :=  (x) for  > 1, while

|(s) - 1(s)|2(1 + log(1 + s2))ds < /2

(2.17)

This latter inequality holds provided  is close enough to 1. Indeed one has

|(s)|2(1 + log(1 + s2))ds < , 1(s) = (-1s),

while the scaling action S of R+ on the Hilbert space of functions on R with the norm

f

2 1

:=

|f (s)|2(1 + log(1 + s2))ds

is pointwise norm continuous. Note first that S() is bounded uniformly near  = 1 since

while (1 + log(1 + 2t2))  2(1 + log(1 + t2)) for all t  R for   2. The pointwise norm continuity of S() follows since this action is pointwise norm continuous on the
dense subspace of continuous functions with compact support. Now the support of 1, 1(x) :=  (x) is contained in the interval [--1L/2, -1L/2]. Thus the convolution 2 =   1 with a smooth function   Cc(R) whose support is contained in a small enough neighborhood of 0 is a smooth function with support in the interior of the interval
[-L/2, L/2]. Fix such a  positive with integral equal to 1. Let n(x) = n(nx), and let n = n  1. One has n(s) = (s/n)1(s). The functions (s/n) are bounded |(s/n)|  1 and converge pointwise to 1, thus the Lebesgue dominated convergence
theorem shows that for n large enough, one has

|1(s) - n(s)|2(1 + log(1 + s2))ds < /4.

Finally since n  Cc((-L/2, L/2)) it can be viewed as a smooth function on the circle obtained by identifying the end points of the interval [-L/2, L/2] so that there exists a sequence (ak)kZ of rapid decay such that n = akU k. Equation (2.13) still holds after the change of variables and one gets the equality

| sin(s log ) (k - s log )-1 |2(1 + log(1 + s2))ds.

One has sin2(s)s-2  2(1 + s2)-1, and for any a  R, 1 + (s - a)2  2(1 + a2)(1 + s2) so

that log(1+(s-a)2)  log 2+log(1+s2)+log(1+a2). This shows that

and hence, since n = akU k where the sequence (ak)kZ is of rapid decay, one can find

N such that  =

fulfills

|(s) - n(s)|2(1 + log(1 + s2))ds < /4.

(2.19)

Combining (2.17), (2.18), (2.19) one obtains the required approximation.
Proposition 2.3. Let  > 1. The quadratic form QW : L2([-1, ], du)  (-, +] of (2.11) fulfills, for any f  L2([-1, ], du),

QW(f ) = lim inf QW(gn), gn  C[U, U -1]
gn f

(2.20)

Proof. By applying the lower semicontinuity of QW one sees that in (2.20) the lhs is smaller than the rhs. The density of C[U, U -1] in the domain of QW for the graph-
norm shown in Lemma 2.2, proves that if f is in the domain of QW there exists a sequence gn of elements of C[U, U -1] converging to f in norm, and such that QW(f ) =
limgnf QW(gn).

Corollary 2.4. The lower bound of QW is the limit, when N  , of the smallest eigenvalue of the restriction of QW to the linear span EN of the functions U k for
|k|  N .

2.1.3. Basis of real functions in C[U, U -1]. In order to compute explicitly the smallest eigenvalue of the restriction of QW to the linear span EN of the functions U k, for |k|  N , as in Corollary 2.4, we first find a convenient orthonormal basis formed of real valued functions. We first consider the Hilbert space L2([-L/2, L/2])  L2(R) with the
inner product defined by the formula

L/2

(x)(x)dx

We note the following simple facts

Lemma 2.5. Let L > 0, j  L2([-L/2, L/2]) and  = 1  2. Then (i) The support of  is contained in the interval [-L, L], and for t  [0, L] one has

L/2

(t) =

1(x)2(x - t)dx, (-t) =

1(x - t)2(x)dx.

(ii) If the functions j are real, then: 1  2(-t) = 2  1(t). (iii) If the functions j are real, with 1 even and 2 odd, then for all t  R one has:

1  2(t) + 2  1(t) = 0.

Proof. (i) The function  is given, using 2(x) = 2(-x), by

(t) = 1(x)2(x - t)dx t  R.
R
Since the integrand is not zero only if x  [-L/2, L/2] and x - t  [-L/2, L/2], one can restrict the integration in the interval [t - L/2, L/2]. The second equality follows using the equality  = 2  1. (ii) Follows from  = 2  1. (iii) Notice that 2 = -2 since 2 is real and odd, and 1 = 1 since 1 is real and even, thus one derives: 1  2 + 2  1 = -1  2 + 2  1 = 0.
It is convenient to rewrite the Weil sesquilinear form QW (f, g) = (f   g) using the natural invariance of the functional  under the symmetry h(u) := h(u-1). Thus

(h) = #(h + h), h(u) := h(u-1)

Proof. (ii) Follows from Lemma 2.5. (iii) The table reported in (iii) is obtained by direct computation. (i) The formulas reported in (iii) show that all functions involved are in the domain of applicability W of the explicit formulas (see §2.1.1). Moreover the terms of the explicit formulas correspond to the terms which enter in the definition (2.11) of the quadratic form QW in Proposition 2.1.

Lemma 2.6 (ii) shows that  is a symmetric matrix and that

(n, m) = 0 , n  0, m < 0.

Thus  splits in two blocks  = + - which we shall call informally as the "even " and "odd " matrices. They correspond to the partition Z = {n  0}  {n < 0} and one has

QW = QW+  QW-,  = +  -.

This decomposition shows that the positivity of the Weil quadratic form can be tested working separately the cases of even functions (using the matrix +) and odd functions (using -). In the chosen basis n, the even case corresponds to considering elements of the basis indexed by n  0, while the odd case involves the n's indexed by n < 0.

2.1.4. The matrix w0,2(n, m). Next, we shall describe the contribution of the first two terms in (2.8) to the matrix (m, n). The following lemma shows that these terms contribute by a rank one matrix to both the odd and the even matrices ±.

its contribution to the quadratic form QW is a positive one for small values of L, due to

the minus sign in front of W + (in (2.23)). This very same contribution becomes negative
R

for larger values of L.

2.2. Sensitivity of Weil positivity, archimedean place
The first fact we report from the numerical computations is that the archimedean contribution fails to remain positive when extended a bit beyond the value L = log 2. In the following two graphs (Figure 5 and 6) we report the variation of the smallest eigenvalue for the even matrix +, as the value of L approaches and then stretches a bit beyond log 2. When one considers values of L in the interval log 2  L < log 3, the contribution of the primes to the Weil quadratic form is only by p = 2, and of the form

Wp(F ) = p-1/2 log p ((log p) + (- log p)) .

(2.33)

Figure 7 shows that adding the contribution of the prime 2 to the archimedean contribution restores the positivity of the even matrix +. The graph is in terms of µ := exp L, and this choice of the variable is dictated by the fact that its integer prime power values play a crucial role in this study.

2.3. Sensitivity of Weil positivity to the precise value p = 2
Figure 7 shows that beyond µ = 2 the contribution (2.33) of the prime 2 first lowers the smallest eigenvalue in the interval exp L  (2, 2.27) but then saves it from being negative. The value of the smallest eigenvalue of + for µ = 3 is < 6 × 10-8. This suggests to use p as a variable in (2.33) and to test the sensitivity of Weil positivity to the precise value p = 2. To this end one fixes L = log 3 (i.e. µ = 3) and replaces 2 by a variable p in (2.33).

As Figure 8 shows, one finds that the smallest eigenvalue (p) for L = log 3 is negative
for p = 1.9999 and also for p = 2.0005, so that the positivity requirement restricts the choice of p to an interval of size < 10-3 around p = 2.

2.4. Change of sign of smallest eigenvalue
Beyond p = 3 the sign of the smallest eigenvalue of the sum of the contributions of  and 2 to the even matrix + is reported in yellow in Figure 9. Once again we notice that its negative behavior beyond µ = 3 is "fixed" and the output (in blue in the figure) switches to be positive by adding the contribution of the prime 3.

3. Eigenfunctions and the prolate projection (, k)
In this section we explain the existence of the very small eigenvalues of the Weil quadratic form QW on test functions with support in an interval [-1, ]  R+. We start by recalling that if RH holds, then the Weil quadratic form restricted to functions with support in a finite interval has zero radical, since the number N (r) of zeros of modulus at most r of the Fourier transform of a function f with compact support is of the order N (r) = O(r) (see [8] §15.20 (2)), while if f belonged to the radical of QW it would (assuming RH), vanish on all zeros of the Riemann zeta function whose number grows faster than O(r). On the other hand, the radical of QW contains the range of the map E defined on the codimension two subspace S0ev  S(R) of even Schwartz functions fulfilling f (0) = f (0) = 0 by the formula ([3])

E(f )(x) = x1/2 f (nx).
n>0

(3.1)

It is thus natural to bring-in (3.1) for the construction of functions g with support in
[-1, ]  R+ which belong to the "near radical" of QW i.e. fulfill QW(g) g 2. The definition of E shows that if the support of the even function f  S0ev is contained in the interval [-, ]  R, then the support of E(f ) is contained in (0, ]  R+. On the
other hand, by applying the Poisson formula (with f the Fourier transform of f ) one has

E(f )(x) = E(f )(x-1) , f  S0ev.

(3.2)

Thus we see that -1 would be a lower bound of the support of E(f ) if the support of the even function f  S0ev were contained in the interval [-, ]  R. However this latter inclusion is impossible since the Fourier transform of a function with compact support is
analytic. In spite of this apparent obstacle in the construction, the work of Slepian and
Pollack on band limited functions [11] provides a very useful approximate solution. The
conceptual way to formulate their result is in terms of the pair of projections P and P in the Hilbert space L2(R)ev of square integrable even functions. The operator P is the multiplication by the characteristic function of the interval [-, ]  R, and the
projection P is its conjugate by the (additive) Fourier transform FeR . These two projections have zero intersection but their "angle", ­ an operator with discrete spectrum­ admits approximatively 22 very small eigenvalues whose associated eigenfunctions pro-
vide excellent candidates for the "approximate intersection" P  P. In their work on signals transmission, Slepian and Pollack discovered that these eigenfunctions are
exactly the prolate spheroidal wave functions which were already known to be solutions
(by separation of variables) of the Helmoltz equation for prolate spheroids.
The basic result of Slepian and Pollack is the diagonalisation of the positive operator PPP in the Hilbert space L2([-, ]). They show that this operator commutes with the differential operator

(W)(q) = -((2 - q2)) (q) + (2q)2 (q)

(here  is the ordinary differentiation in one variable q  [-, ] and the dense domain is that of smooth functions on [-, ]). The operator W (obtained by closing its domain in the graph norm) is selfadjoint and positive and its eigenfunctions are the prolate spheroidal wave functions. When considering the Weil quadratic form QW evaluated on test functions with support in [-1, ] we shall compare the eigenvectors associated to the extremely small eigenvalues with the range of the map E applied to linear combinations of eigenfunctions  of W which belong to the approximate intersection P  P and vanish at zero. For this process, we only take the eigenfunctions  which are even functions of the variable q, and distinguish two cases since the action of the Fourier transform fulfills FeR  ± on eigenfunctions  of W. The corresponding sign ± determines precisely the choice of an eigenvector for the even or odd matrix. In standard notation one sets

m,(x) := PS 2m,0

22, x 

where m, is a function on the interval [-, ] that one extends by 0 outside that
interval. Its Fourier transform FeR (m,) is equal to mm, on [-, ], where the scalar m is very close to (-1)m provided that m is less than 22. More precisely, FeR (m,) is computed using the equality

1
PS 2m,0(, ) exp(i) d = (-1)m2S2(1m),0(, 1)PS 2m,0(, )

for

.

After

the

equality

becomes


m,() exp(i2y) d = (-1)m2S2(1m),0(22, 1)m,(y).

Given µ = 2, one only retains the values of m for which the characteristic value (µ, m) = 2S2(1m),0(2µ, 1) is almost equal to 1. This determines a collection {0, . . . , (µ)} of length approximately equal to 2µ, such that (µ, m)  1 for m  (µ). The formula
(µ) = 2µ - 1 works well when µ is a small half integer.

In order to define the prolate projection we consider linear combinations of prolate functions which vanish at 0 and are given, for n > 0, by

2n(x) := 2n(x)0(0) - 0(x)2n(0), 2n+1(x) := 2n+1(x)1(0) - 1(x)2n+1(0).

For 1 < n  (µ) one may approximate FeR (n) by (-1)nn and, using the Poisson formula, act as if E(n) would fulfill the equality E(n)(u-1) = (-1)nE(n)(u). We
can then compute the components of E(n) in the orthogonal basis j(u) = j(log u) of H = L2([-1, ], dx) (Lemma 2.6) which fulfill j(u-1) = -j(u) for j < 0 and j(u-1) = j(u) for j  0. For 1 < n  (µ), the component of E(n) on j is non-zero only if j has the same parity as n, i.e. fulfills j(u-1) = (-1)nj(u), and in this case is
given by the formula,

E (n )j

/r

2

u1/2 n (ru)j (u)d u.

1r< 1

(3.4)

One computes all these components for |j|  N with N large, and applies the GramSchmidt orthogonalization process (separately for the even and odd cases) to the obtained vectors in EN . This process determines orthonormal vectors n  EN  H = L2([-1, ], dx) for 1 < n  (µ) which are, by construction, the natural candidate functions to be compared (up to sign) with the eigenfunctions of the semi-local Weil quadratic form QW on EN .
Definition 3.1. Let k < (2). We define (, k) as the orthogonal projection on the linear span of the vectors n, for n  {2, . . . , k + 1}.
Let  be the grading operator in H = L2([-1, ], dx) which takes the values ±1 on functions satisfying the equality f (u-1) = ±f (u). By construction, the vectors n are eigenvectors of  and the following commutativity holds

 (, k) = (, k)  , , k

(3.5)

The series of graphs reported here below display the coincidence of the n with the actual eigenfunctions of the semi-local Weil quadratic form QW for the smallest eigenvalues. When only one graph appears (in yellow the graph of the 's) this means that the graphs of the two functions match with a high precision, otherwise the graph in blue of the eigenfunction is no longer hidden behind the yellow graph. Notice that the coincidence of 2m with the eigenfunction of the even matrix for its m-th eigenvalue is expected to hold only when this eigenvalue is small and hence only when µ > m. Similarly, one expects the coincidence of 2m+1 with the eigenfunction of the odd matrix for its m-th eigenvalue only when µ > m + 1 (since the number of small eigenvalues of the odd matrix is one less than for the even one). We have nevertheless plotted the graphs for all half integer values of µ between 3.5 and 11 to show the mismatch of the graphs when µ is too small.

4. The spectral triple (, k) = (A(), H(), D(, k))
The spectral triple (, k) = (A(), H(), D(, k)) described in this section, whose spectrum has a remarkable similarity with the low lying zeros of the Riemann zeta function is defined through the action by multiplication of the algebra of smooth functions A() := C(R+/2Z) on the Hilbert space H() := L2(R+/2Z, du). The operator D(, k) is defined by the following formula

D(, k) := (1 - (, k))  D0()  (1 - (, k)), D0() := (-iuu). (4.1)
This is a finite rank perturbation of the standard Dirac operator D0(), since by construction the range of the prolate projection (, k) is contained in the domain of D0(), so that one derives

D(, k) = D0() - (, k)D0() - D0()(, k) + (, k)D0()(, k).

Proposition 4.1. The operator D(, k), combined with the action of periodic functions by multiplication in L2([-L/2, L/2]) defines a spectral triple.

Proof. The operator D(, k) is a finite rank perturbation of D0(), thus by the KatoRellich theorem (see [9] Proposition 8.6) it is essentially self-adjoint on any core of D0(). The domain of D(, k) is the same as the domain of D0() and the boundedness of the commutator [D(, k), f ] follows from the boundedness of the perturbation.

To compare the spectrum of D(, k), for k just below the upper bound (2)  22 (discussed in section 3), with the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, one needs to select an appropriate range of eigenvalues for which the comparison is meaningful. By construction the number of eigenvalues of D(, k) in the interval [0, E] has the same asymptotic behavior as for D0(), and thus differs from the asymptotic behavior of the number N (E) of zeros of the Riemann zeta function with imaginary part in the interval [0, E], namely

N (E) = #{ | () = 0, and 0 < ()  E}.

(4.2)

This number is the sum of two contributions: N (E) = N (E) + Nosc(E). The oscillatory term Nosc(E) is of order log E and, more importantly in this context, one knows that

E EE N (E) = log - .
2 2 2

(4.3)

When considering the operator D(, k), with k smaller and close to the upper bound (2), we let µ = 2 and we obtain the following

Proposition 4.2. For E = 2µ, the number N (E) of non-zero eigenvalues of the operator D(, k) in the interval (0, E] fulfills N (E)  N (E) .

Spectral triples and -cycles

Proof. It follows from (3.5) that D(, k) = -D(, k) so that the number of eigenval-

ues of D(, k) of absolute value less than E is 2N (E) plus the dimension of the kernel

of D(, k). The spectrum of D(, k) is a perturbation of the spectrum of D0() i.e. of

4.1. Examples µ = 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5
In this part we report some numerical evidence showing the close resemblance of the spectrum of D(, k) with the low lying zeros of the Riemann zeta function, for a sample of small values of µ.

4.1.1. µ = 5.5. For µ = 5.5, the cosine eigenvalues (5.5, n) are extremely close to 1 when n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and given for the next values of n in the following table

12 0.139174533954574303539

Thus one derives that (5.5) = 10, since the next eigenvalue 0.5719706153 is far from 1. One has 25.5  34.5575. The following table compares the positive eigenvalues j = j(D(, k)) of D(, k) (reported on the left column) with the imaginary part j of the first zeros of the Riemann zeta function (right column)

4.2. Average discrepancy
For an objective comparison of the N (2µ) eigenvalues j of size up to 2µ, with the imaginary parts j of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, one has at disposal the following three possible measures of the discrepancy

1. Mean absolute error:

1 A(µ) :=
N (2µ)

|j - j|

When this error is computed for the values of µ used in the previous pages it gives

the following list of values

A(5.5) = 0.635176, A(6.5) = 0.44693, A(7.5) = 0.528827,

A(8.5) = 0.456739, A(9.5) = 0.395068

2. Root-mean-square deviation. It is defined as the square root of the average value of the square deviation

1 R(µ) :=
N (2µ)

(j - j )2

This gives the following list of values

R(5.5) = 0.691088, R(6.5) = 0.48858, R(7.5) = 0.650648,

R(8.5) = 0.562489, R(9.5) = 0.459776
3. Normalized root-mean-square deviation. This deviation is obtained by dividing the root-mean-square deviation by the diameter of the range of the variables. It is invariant under affine transformations and is thus a good measure of the discrepancy, usually expressed as a percentage. The diameter of the range of the variables is here equal to 2µ - 14, and this gives the list,

N R(5.5) = 0.0375848, N R(6.5) = 0.0185609, N R(7.5) = 0.0205914,

42

A. Connes and C. Consani

N R(8.5) = 0.0148189, N R(9.5) = 0.0103126, N R(10.5) = 0.00995148
These numbers show that the normalized root-mean-square deviation is steadily improving and reaches 1% (one percent) for µ = 9.5 and then drops to less than one percent for µ = 10.5.

5. Zeta zeros from eigenvalues of spectral triples
In the previous section we explored the low lying eigenvalues of the spectral triples (, k) = (A(), H(), D(, k)) for k = 2 an even number as close as possible to the boundary (2)  22 of the allowed interval. These numerical results give evidence of a deep relation between the low lying spectrum n(D(, k)) of these spectral triples and the low lying zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The dependence on the parameters (, k), and the difference between the growth of the eigenvalues and that of the zeros of zeta, show that the relation is certainly more subtle than a simple equality between the eigenvalues n(D(, k)) and the imaginary part n of the zeros.
The main observation of this section is that, for any n  N there are special values of the parameter  at which the dependence of n(D(, k)) on k disappears. For these special values of  the common value of the n(D(, k)) coincides with the imaginary part n of the n-th zero of the Riemann zeta function. Moreover, these special values of  form a geometric progression whose scale factor is the exponential of /n.
This observation was first experimentally tested and it will be fully and conceptually justified in section 6.
We shall pursue 4 different criterions to detect these special values of . They are
· Comparison of n(D(, 2 )) with n(D(, 2 + 1)) (§5.1) · Evolution of n(D(, k)) as a function of  (§5.2) · Quantization criterion x2iy = 1 applied to the point (, n(D(, k))) (§5.3) · How far is the eigenvector n(D(, k)) for D(, k) from being an eigenvector of D0()
The numerical tests of these criterions show their agreement, but the precision becomes very sharp when one applies the last criterion. Applying the last method for the small range of  in the interval (2, 4) one obtains the agreement with the first 31 zeros n (n  31) of zeta with sufficient accuracy to assess the probability of a fortuitous coincidence at 10-50.

5.1. The criterion n(D(, 2 ))  n(D(, 2 + 1))

The first step in order to detect the special values of  is to see what happens if one

replaces k = 2 by the odd number k + 1 = 2 + 1. One sees that the positive eigenvalues

n(D(, )) decrease and actually agree for special values of . We first briefly explain why n(D(, 2 ))  n(D(, 2 + 1)) and then display some numerical results showing the coincidence for special values of . By construction, the kernel of D(, k) contains

the range of (, k) and is thus at least of dimension k. Moreover by (3.5) one has, for

the grading  of H(),

 D(, k) = -D(, k) 

(5.1)

Spectral triples and -cycles

43

The kernel of the operator D0() is one dimensional and given by the constant function 1 which is even (i.e. (1) = 1). This implies that the graded index of the operator D0() is equal to 1. Then by stability of the index it follows that the graded index of the operator D(, k) is also equal to 1. This means that the signature of the restriction of  to the kernel of D(, k) is 1 and hence that the dimension of ker(D(, k)) is an odd number. Thus for k = 2 even it is natural to expect this kernel to be of dimension k + 1. This entices one to compare the two non-zero eigenvalues n(D(, k)) and n(D(, k + 1)). By construction one has (, k) < (, k + 1), and we now explain why the positive eigenvalues of these operators, arranged in increasing order, fulfill the inequality

Lemma 5.1. Let A be a self-adjoint matrix of dimension N , and E  KerA a subspace of its kernel. Then the positive eigenvalues µn(A) arranged in decreasing order fulfill

µn(A) = max min  | A F |dim F =n F

F E

 =1

Proof. By the mini-max theorem of Courant-Fisher one has

(5.3)

µn(A) = max min  | A
F |dim F =n F
 =1

and we need to show that the added condition that F is perpendicular to E does not change the maximum. It can only lower it and it is enough to check that the choice of F which reaches the maximum in the Courant-Fisher formula does fulfill F  E. Indeed this F is the linear span of the eigenvectors for eigenvalues µk(A) for k  n, and all these eigenvectors are orthogonal to the kernel of A since µk(A)  µn(A) > 0 for k  n.

Proposition 5.2. Let D  MN (C) be a self-adjoint matrix. (i) Let P  MN (C) be a projection (self-adjoint idempotent) and Q = 1-P , DP := QDQ. Then the positive eigenvalues of DP arranged in decreasing order fulfill the equality

µn(DP ) = max min  | D F |dim F =n F

F P

 =1

(5.4)

(ii) Let Pj  MN (C) be projections such that P1  P2. Then, with the notations of (i) the positive eigenvalues of DPj fulfill the inequality

µn(DP2 )  µn(DP1 ) Proof. (i) By (5.3) applied for A = DP and E = P (CN ) one has

(5.5)

µn(DP ) =

max

min  | DP 

F |dim F =n,F E F |  =1

44

and for   E one has Q =  so that

 | DP  =  | QDQ = Q | DQ =  | D

which gives (5.4).
(ii) We apply (5.4) to µn(DPj ). The condition F  P2 is more restrictive than F  P1 so one obtains (5.5).

When dealing with the operators D(, k), with k close to the largest allowed value (2)  22 one introduces necessarily a discontinuity due to the discrete nature of the variable
k. To avoid it one can, for fixed k, consider the dependence of the eigenvalues n(D(, k)) as long as  is sufficiently large so that k < (2). One finds that for the values = 2, 3,
the n(D(, 2 )) agree around µ  3.8 and that their common value is close to 1. This

46

A. Connes and C. Consani

fact is all the more remarkable that when µ < 4 i.e.  < 2 there is no summation involved in the (3.4). For = 3, 4, 5, the n(D(, 2 )) agree around µ  5.95 and again we find that their common value is close to 1. For = 5, 6, 7, 8, the n(D(, 2 )) agree around µ  9.2 and again their value is close to 1. For = 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 the n(D(, 2 )) agree around µ  14.4 and their value is close to 1. The special values of µ at which the graphs meet appear to form a geometric progression. One finds that the ratio of consecutive terms is  exp(2/1) and, more generally that for the n-th eigenvalue the special values of µ form a geometric progression with scale ratio  exp(2/n) where n is the imaginary part of the n-th zero of zeta. These "experimental" facts will be theoretically explained by Theorem 6.4.

5.3. Quantization of length log µ
The fact that many graphs of the eigenvalues n(D(, k)) meet at some specific points of the plane suggests that one could push the comparison even further and compare these points with the spectrum of the unperturbed operator D0(). In terms of the coordinates (x, y) where x = µ = 2 and y = n(D(, k)), the spectrum of D0() is characterized by the quantization condition xiy = 1. The subset of the plane defined by this condition is the union of the graphs of the functions 2n/ log x.

Figure 48 shows a perfect agreement between these graphs and the meeting points of the eigenvalue graphs. Independently of this result, one can measure how far the point (µ, n(D(, k)) is from fulfilling the quantization condition by writing it in the form
µin(D(,k)) = 1  |µin(D(,k)) - 1| = 0

and by plotting the graphs of these functions for each integer n. They are shown in Figure 49 for n = 1 and in Figure 54 for n = 2. The key fact here is that the values of µ at which these functions vanish coincide with the previously determined values where 1(D(, k + 1))  1(D(, k)) of Figures 44 and 45.

5.4. The criterion of common eigenvector for D(, k) and D0()
The agreement of the quantization with the meeting points of the graphs of the eigenvalues suggests that all the eigenvectors of the D(, k) involved agree with each other and are in fact eigenvectors of the unperturbed operator D0(). This gives a very strong criterion obtained by measuring the Hilbert space distance of an eigenvector n(D(, k)) for D(, k) with the eigenvector of D0() which has the same rotation number. In Figures

6. -cycles
The aim of this section is to provide a theoretical explanation for the numerical computations reported in the previous part of this paper, and in particular to give a theoretical justification for the close similarity of the spectrum of the operator D(, k) in the spectral triple (, k) (see Section 4) and the low lying zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The goal we shall pursue here is to relate these intriguing numerical results with the spectral realization of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, as developed in [3]. The new theoretical concept emerging is that of a -cycle C. In the following part we first explain how to define scale invariant Riemann sums for functions defined on [0, ) with vanishing integral. This technique is then implemented in the definition of a linear map µE : S0ev  L2(C) which plays a central role in this development and enters in the definition of the -cycle (Definition 6.1). In §6.2 we prove that -cycles are stable under finite covers, and finally we state and prove the main result of this paper, namely Theorem 6.4. This result naturally selects a family of Hilbert spaces H(L) := µE(S0ev) naturally associated to the critical zeros of the Riemann zeta function.

6.1. Scale invariant Riemann sums and the map µE
Let µ > 1 and µ be the linear map defined on functions g : R+  C by the following formula

(µg)(u) := g(µku).
kZ

(6.1)

This definition makes sense pointwise provided g decays fast enough at 0 and  in R+. The map E is defined as follows

(Ef )(u) := u1/2 f (nu).
n>0

(6.2)

It is, by construction, proportional to a Riemann sum for the integral of f . We let S0ev be the linear space of real valued even Schwartz functions f  S(R) such that f (0) = 0 = f (x)dx. The following lemma describes the "well-behavior" of the map E.

Lemma 6.1. Let f be a function of bounded variation on (0, ), of rapid decay for

u  , O(u2) when u  0, and such that

 0

f (t)dt

=

0.

Then

the

following

properties

hold

(i) E(f )(u) is well-defined pointwise, is O(u1/2) when u  0 and of rapid decay for

u  .

(ii) The series (6.1) defining µE(f ) is geometrically convergent, and defines a bounded measurable function on R+/µZ.

obtains the upper-bound



 (n+1)u

|df (t)|.

n=0 nu

The integral of the measure |df (t)| is finite since f is of bounded variation. We thus derive





f (nu)  |df (t)|

n=0

0

and from this it follows that |E(f )(u)| = O(u1/2) for u  0. (ii) Since f (u) is of rapid decay for u  , one has |f (u)|  Cu-N , N > 1 and this
implies |f (nu)|  Cu-N n-N = C u-N .

n1

n1

Thus E(f )(u) is of rapid decay for u  . Let u  [-1, ]. The terms of the series

E(f )(µku) converge geometrically for k > 0; for k  0 (i) gives |E(f )(µku)|  Cµk/2

Z
and hence the required uniform geometric convergence follows.

The scaling action of R+ on functions is defined by (()f )(x) := f (-1x). Next lemma describes the behavior of the scaling action in relation to the map E

Lemma 6.2. (i) The Schwartz space S0ev is globally invariant under the scaling action  and with µ > 1, the following equalities hold

E  -1/2() = ()  E, ()µ = µ()

(6.3)

(ii) The scaling action  induces an action of the multiplicative group Cµ = R+/µZ on µE (S0ev).

Spectral triples and -cycles

51

(iii) Let f be a function as in Lemma 6.1 that coincides near zero with a smooth even function, then µE(f ) belongs to the closure of µE(S0ev) in L2(Cµ).
Proof. The conditions defining the subspace S0ev  S(R) are invariant under the scaling action. One has

E(()f )(u) = u1/2 f (n-1u) = 1/2()(E(f ))(u).
n>0
Moreover one has: ()µ = µ(). Thus, since S0ev is invariant under the scaling action, the same invariance holds for its image µE(S0ev) on which the scaling action is now periodic of period µ. From this fact one derives an induced action of the multiplicative group Cµ = R+/µZ. Let f be as in Lemma 6.1. Let > 0 and   Cc(R+) have support in a small neighbourhood of 1 and be such that, for the norm in L2(Cµ),

()µE(f ) - µE(f ) < .

By applying (6.3) one has, for a ~  Cc(R+) with the same support as : ()µE(f ) = µE((~)(f )). Finally, the hypothesis on f show that the function (~)(f ) belongs to S0ev .
6.2. Zeros of zeta and -cycles
We identify a circle of length L = log µ > 0 with the quotient space Cµ := R+/µZ viewed as a homogeneous space over the multiplicative group R+. This space is endowed with the measure du associated to the Haar measure of the multiplicative group R+. One thus obtains a canonical bundle of R+-homogeneous spaces over the base (0, ).
We keep the notations introduced in the previous part.

Definition 6.1. A -cycle is a circle C of length L = log µ such that the subspace µE(S0ev) is not dense in the Hilbert space L2(C).
As for closed geodesics, the -cycles are stable under finite covers.

Proposition 6.3. Let C be a -cycle of length L = log µ, then for any positive integer n > 0 the n-fold cover of C is a -cycle.

Proof. Let  : Cn  C be the n-fold cover of C. From the adjunction of the operation  : L2(C)  L2(Cn) with the operation of sum on the preimage of a point, it follows that if a vector   L2(C) belongs to the orthogonal to µE(S0ev) L2(C) with µ = exp L, then  is orthogonal to µn E(S0ev).
We are now ready to state and prove our main result. The spectral realization of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function of [3] admits the following geometric variant

Theorem 6.4. (i) Let C be a -cycle. Then the spectrum of the action of the multi-

plicative group R+ on the orthogonal complement of µE(S0ev) in L2(C) is formed by imaginary parts of zeros of zeta on the critical line.

Conversely:

(ii)

tiple of 2/s is a zeta cycle and its spectrum, for the action of R+ on µE(S0ev)  L2(C),

Proof. (i) The action of the multiplicative group R+ on the orthogonal of µE(S0ev) in L2(C) is periodic and factors through the action of the multiplicative group G = R+/µZ. Since G is a compact abelian group the representation of G is a direct sum of unitary
characters. Let  be any such unitary character, then there then exists s  R with µis = 1, such that (u) = uis for all u  G = R+/µZ. The orthogonality property of an eigenvector with eigenvalue  with respect to the subspace µE(S0ev)  L2(C) implies the following vanishing

(u)µE(f )(u)du = 0 , f  S0ev.
G

In turn, this implies the vanishing of the following integral

uisE(f )(u)du = 0 , f  S0ev.

Let in particular f (x) := e-x2 x2

(6.4)

To justify the use of Fubini theorem in proving (6.4), note that for N > 1 one derives from Lemma 6.1 the following estimate

|f (nu)|  Cu-N n-N = C u-N , u > 1

n1

n1

which shows that the series n1 |f (nu)| is of rapid decay for u  . For u  0 we use instead the rough estimate, due to the absolute integrability of f , of the form

|f (nu)| = O(u-1).

This ensures the validity of Fubini for

(z)

>

1/2.

Now,

we

know

that

a

pole at z = i/2, but since (i/2) = 0 this singularity does not affect the above product

(z) > -5/2. By applying

Lemma 6.1, we see that the function E(f )(u) is O(u1/2) when u  0 and of rapid decay

for u  . Thus R+ E(f )(u)u-izdu is holomorphic in the half-plane (z) > -1/2.

Therefore

may

that

(6.4)

if

obtains

E(f )(u)uisdu = 0 , f  S0ev.
R+

At the beginning of this proof one has defined L = 2n/s: let now µ = exp L then one has
µis = exp(2in) = 1. In this way the function (u) := uis is well-defined on C = R+/µZ and the following vanishing holds in L2(C)

µE(f ) |  = (u)µE(f )(u)du = E(f )(u)uisdu = 0 , f  S0ev.

G

R+

This shows that C is a zeta-cycle and that its spectrum contains is.

The above development provides us with a family of Hilbert spaces H(L) :=
µE(S0ev)  L2(C) and, for each integer n > 0, maps n : H(L)  H(nL) which lift the action of N× on (0, ). Moreover we also have an action () of R+ on H(L) and we have shown that the linear maps n are equivariant. Let Z be the set of imaginary
parts of critical zeros of the Riemann zeta function, one finally deduces the following

Corollary 6.5.

H(L) = {0}  s  Z, n  Z s.t. sL = 2n.

(6.5)

Spectral triples and -cycles

55

Proof. Assume first that sL = n with s and n positive. Then it follows from Theorem
6.4 (ii), that H(L) = {0}, since the circle of length L is a zeta-cycle. Conversely, if
H(L) = {0} then the circle C of length L is a zeta-cycle and there exists by Theorem 6.4 (i), a positive s  Z and a non zero vector   H(L) such that ()() = is for all   R+. Since the action of R+ on L2(C) is periodic of period µ = exp(L) we have µis = 1 and this entails sL  2Z.

7. Outlook
In this paper we have unveiled a new compelling relation between noncommutative geometry and the Riemann zeta function using the concept of spectral triple. The previous relations are
· The BC system is a system of quantum statistical mechanics with spontaneous symmetry breaking which admits the Riemann zeta function as its partition function.
· The adele class space of Q is a noncommutative space, dual to the BC-system and directly related to the zeros of the L-functions with Grossencharacter [3].
· The quantized calculus is a key ingredient of the semi-local trace formula and it provides a source of positivity for the Weil quadratic form [6].
It turns out that the adele class space of Q in its topos theoretic incarnation as the Scaling Site (the topos S = [0, ) N×) is the natural parameter space for the circles of length L which play a critical role in the present paper. Proposition 6.3 gives the compatibility of -cycles with the action of N× by multiplication on the parameter L. The action of N× coming from coverings turns L2(C) into a sheaf over the Scaling Site S . The family of subspaces µE(S0)  L2(C) generate a subsheaf of modules over the sheaf of smooth functions and one is then entitled to consider the cohomology of the quotient sheaf over S . Endowed with the R+-equivariance this cohomology provides the spectral realization of the critical zeros of zeta, taking care, in particular, of eventual multiplicity. We shall discuss this fact in details in a forthcoming paper which, in particular, gives an application of the algebraic geometry over S developed in [4]
Finally, the stability of -cycles under coverings is reminiscent of the behavior of closed geodesics in a Riemannian manifold, suggesting to look for a mysterious "cusp" whose closed geodesics would correspond to -cycles.
