## Abstract

We study different aspects the worldline path integrals with gauge fields using quantum computing. We use the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Evolution of Hamiltonian (EOH) quantum algorithms and IBM QISKit to perform our computations. We apply these methods to the path integral of a particle moving in a Abelian and non-Abelian background gauge field associated with a constant magnetic field and the field of a chromo-magnetic field. In all cases we found excellent agreement with the classical computation. We also discuss the insertion of vertex operators into the worldline path integrals to study scattering and show how to represent them using unitary operators and quantum gates on near term quantum computers.
