Abstract
We obtain an exact spherically symmetric and magnetically charged black hole solution in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity coupled with rational nonlinear electrodynamics. The thermodynamics of our model is studied. We calculate the Hawking temperature and the heat capacity of the black hole. The phase transitions occur in the point where the Hawking temperature possesses an extremum. We show that black holes are thermodynamically stable at some range of event horizon radii when the heat capacity is positive. The logarithmic correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is obtained.
The string theories give rise to effective models of gravity in higher dimensions with higher order curvature terms in the action when approaching the low energy limit. The Gauss-Bonnet (GB) Lagrangian, including higher order curvature terms, in four dimensions (4D), can be represented as a total derivative and, therefore, it possesses a topological nature. It was shown that the GB coupling constant  can be re-scaled as /(D - 4). Then in the limit D  4 there will be a contribution to the theory in 4D without singularities [1] and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) theory leads to non-trivial dynamics. It should be noted that the 4D EGB gravity theory was debated in [2]-[9]. But the dimensional regularization of [1] is justified for some class of spherically-symmetric metric [7], [8]. The EGB theory of gravity has the attractive feature such as a repulsive gravitational force at short distances, and the GB term can be considered as a quantum correction to gravity [10], [11]. The singularity problem in BH physics is absent because the gravitational force is repulsive at small distances. It is worth noting that 4D EGB theory

preserves the number of graviton degrees of freedom, and as a result, it is

free from the Ostrogradsky instability. The 4D EGB gravity theory recently

received much attention (an incomplete list) [12]- [26]. In this paper we find

a black hole solution in the 4D EGB model coupled to rational nonlinear

electrodynamics (RNED) as proposed in [27]. It is worth noting that non-

linear electrodynamics (NED) plays very important role in cosmology and

black hole physics [28]-[34].

with the parameter  (  0) having the dimension of (length)4, F = (1/4)FµF µ = (B2 - E2)/2, Fµ = µA -  Aµ is the field strength tensor. The GB Lagrangian reads

Taking into consideration that the electric charge qe = 0, F = qm2 /(2r4) (qm is a magnetic charge), one obtains from Eq. (6) the magnetic energy density

The symmetrical energy-momentum tensor (6) with the spherical symmetry leads to Tt t = Tr r. Then we obtain the radial pressure pr = -Tr r = -. The tangential pressure is defined by p = -T = -T and is [35]

where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the argument. The Weak Energy Condition (WEC) is satisfied when   0 and  + pk  0 (k=1,2,3) [36], i.e. the energy density is positive. In accordance with Eq. (8)   0. From Eq. (8) one finds

(r)

0.

(10)

As a result WEC   0,  + pr  0,  + p  0 is satisfied for the model considered. The Dominant Energy Condition (DEC) holds if and only if [36]
  0,  + pk  0,  - pk  0 which includes WEC. Therefore, we need only to verify the condition  - p  0. From Eqs. (8)-(10) we obtain

p

(11)

Thus, DEC is satisfied and, as a result, the sound speed is less than the speed

of light. The Strong Energy Condition (SEC) is satisfied if  +

It follows from Eq. (12) that SEC is not fulfilled. We consider the limit D  4 and at µ =  = t the field equation (4)
gives

The constant of integration was chosen to be 8MG (M is the Schwarzschild BH mass) to have the charged BH solution of GR. In addition, we use the sign minus before the square root in Eqs.

According to Eq. (19) the Reissner-Nordstr¨om behavior of the charged BH holds at infinity.
The limit   0, to have EGB coupled to Maxwell electrodynamics, should be made in Eq. (13) (before the integration). Then the solution to Eq. (13) at  = 0 is given by [12]

It is worth mentioning that the limit r  0 in Eq. (20) leads to a nonphysical complex value of the metric function f (r), but the limit r  0 in Eq. (14) (and (16)) leads to the reasonable value f (0) = 1. The plot of the function (16) is depicted in Fig. 1. Figure 1 shows that there can be two

(21)

where r+ is the event horizon radius defined by the root of the equation

In accordance with Eq. (26) the heat capacity has a singularity when the

Hawking temperature possesses an extremum (TH (x+)/x+ = 0). Equations (22) and (26) show that at some point, x+ = x1, the Hawking tem-

perature and heat capacity become zero and a first-order phase transition

takes place. At this point x1 the BH remnant occurs, where the BH mass

is not zero but the Hawking temperature and the heat capacity vanish. At

the event horizon radius x+ = x2 where TH (x+)/x+ = 0 the heat capacity has the discontinuity. Therefore, in the range x2 > x+ > x1 BHs are locally

stable. At x+ > x2 the BH evaporates and becomes unstable.

Making use of Eqs. (26), (27) and (28) we plotted the heat capacity versus the variable x+ in Fig. 3. Figure 3 shows that the BH is stable in the interval x2 > x+ > x1 where the heat capacity is positive. The singularity in the heat capacity occurs at the points where the Hawking temperature has the extremum and the second-order phase transition takes place.

It follows from Eq. (29) that we have the logarithmic correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in our model of 4D EGB gravity coupled to RNED. It is worth noting that a logarithmic term was obtained in GR with a conformal anomaly [37], [38]. Therefore, we can treat the logarithmic correction as mimicking the quantum corrections. According to Eq. (29), at

8

 = 0 one comes to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. For the large event

horizon radius x+ (for massive BHs) the logarithmic correction to the area

low is not important but for light BHs (for small x+) one can not ignore the

logarithmic term in the entropy.

Equation (29) shows that at some values of , , qm and r+ the entropy

vanishes. (S = 0)

The corresponding event horizon radius r+4 exp(r+2 /) = qm2 , which is r+ =

is the solution of equation 2W0( qm/(2)), where 

W0(x) is the Lambert function. At r+ < 2W0( qm/(2) the entropy is

negative. The negative entropy of BHs was discussed in [39].

We summarize the results obtained as follows. The exact spherically

symmetric and magnetically charged BH solution in 4D EGB gravity coupled

with RNED was obtained. It was demonstrated that WEC and DEC are

satisfied. The thermodynamics and the thermal stability of magnetized BHs

were investigated. The Hawking temperature and the heat capacity of BHs

were calculated in the EGB model coupled to RNED. The phase transitions

occur in the points where the Hawking temperature possesses the extremum.

We have shown that BHs are thermodynamically stable at some range of

event horizon radii when the heat capacity and the Hawking temperature

are positive. The heat capacity diverges at some event horizon radii where

the phase transitions of the second-order occur. The logarithmic correction

to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy was established.
