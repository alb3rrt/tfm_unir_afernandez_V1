DIAMETER THEOREMS ON KA¨ HLER AND QUATERNIONIC KA¨ HLER MANIFOLDS UNDER A POSITIVE LOWER CURVATURE BOUND
MARIA GORDINA AND GUNHEE CHO
Abstract. We define the orthogonal Bakry-E´mery tensor as a generalization of the orthogonal Ricci curvature, and then study diameter theorems on K¨ahler and quaternionic K¨ahler manifolds under positivity assumption on the orthogonal Bakry-E´mery tensor. Moreover, under such assumptions on the orthogonal Bakry-E´mery tensor and the holomorphic or quaternionic sectional curvature on a K¨ahler manifold or a quaternionic K¨ahler manifold respectively, the BonnetMyers type diameter bounds are sharper than in the Riemannian case.

as [1, 2, 9, 13, 14, 20, 23]. Such results connecting Ricci curvature or its generalizations and Bonnet-Myers type theorems have been studied for Riemannian manifolds, and on sub-Riemannian manifolds in [3, 4]. Our focus is on the setting of Ka¨hler geometry and quaternionic Ka¨hler geometry for which such results have not been considered so far.
We will rely on the decomposition of Ricci curvature on Ka¨hler manifolds into orthogonal Ricci curvature and holomorphic sectional curvature as follows.
Ric(X, X) = Ric(X, X) + R(X, X, X, X)/|X|4,

where X is a (1, 0)-tangent vector of the holomorphic tangent bundle on a Ka¨hler manifold M n. A similar decompoesqi:thioscn holedqs:doencoampqousaitteironn_ioofn_icRiKcca¨ih_qleuratgeeronmioentircy. Precise definitions are given by (2.1) and (2.3). Using such a decomposition, it is natural to consider a Bakry-E´mery tensor in both Ka¨hler geometry and quaternionic Ka¨hler geometry similarly to how the Ricci curvature is replaced by a BakryE´mery tensor in Riemannian geometry. The goal of this paper is to study diameter theorems for compact Ka¨hler manifolds and quaternionic Ka¨hler manifolds under various notions of positive lower bounds on the orthogonal Bakry-E´mery type tensor corresponding to the orthogonal Ricci curvature.
First, we note that replacing the positivity of the orthogonal Ricci curvature with a weaker notion of positivity is justified by the following observation. Indeed, the class of complete Ka¨hler manifolds with a positive orthogonal Ricci curvature is rather small although an orthogonal Ricci curvature bound is usually weaker than a Ricci curvature bound. For example, a complete Ka¨hler manifold M n, n 2 with a positive lower bound on the orthogonal Ricci curvature must be compact and always projective [18, Theorem 1.7]. Moreover, for n = 2, a compact M 2 which admits a Ka¨hler metric with Ric > 0 must be biholomorphic to the two-dimensional complex projective space P2C, and for n = 3, a compact Ka¨hler manifold under Ric > 0 must be biholomorphic to either P3C or the smooth quadratic hypersurface in P4C as pointed out by [12, Theorem 1.8]. On the other hand, as there is an example of complete non-compact Riemannian manifold with a non-negative Ricci curvature lower bound, there are also complete non-compact examples of Ka¨hler manifolds with Ric > 0 [18, p151]. Therefore in order to consider the complete Ka¨hler manifolds of the wide class rather than the complete Ka¨hler manifolds of the limited classes possible under the positive orthogonal Ricci curvature, it is reasonable to make at least weaker the positivity condition than the orthogonal Ricci curvature. On the other hand, similarly to the Bakry-E´mery tensor in the Riemannian case, a complete Ka¨hler manifold need not be compact aevsesnhouwnndeirnifEtxhaemoprlteh3eox.g1ao.mnpalle Bakry-E´mery tensor satisfies a positive lower bound
As the Ricci curvature can be written as a sum of orthogonal Ricci curvature and holomorphic (respectively, quaternionic) sectional curvature for Ka¨hler (respectively, quaternionic Ka¨hler) manifolds, we consider two versions of an orthogonal Bakry-E´mery tensor corresponding to the orthogonal Ricci curvature. In the first

BONNET-MYERS THEOREM ON KA¨ HLER AND QUATERNIONIC KA¨ HLER MANIFOLDS 3

case we consider the orthogonal Bakry-E´mery tensor Ric + Hess(), where  is a real-valued smooth function on M and Hess() is the Riemannian Hessian. That is, we omit the holomorphic (respectively, quaternionic) sectional curvature. Note that here we only consider the Bakry-E´mery tensor of a gradient type Hess(). Similarly to how compactness and diameter have been treated on complete Riemannian manifolds in [13, 14], here too, additional smoothness assumptions are needed to obtain the results.

Another approach to compactness and diameter bounds' results using Ricci curvature or Bakry-E´mery tensor assumptions on a Riemannian manifold is to rely

on Bochner's formula. We are exploring such an approach for complete Ka¨hler

Ricci curvature, and then establish such results under the assumptions which are

compatible with this Bochner's formula. The second case is to consider a non-

nionic sectional curvature in the case of quaternionic Ka¨hler manifolds). In the

previous case, the second-order differential operator in Bochner's formula for the

orthogonal Ricci curvature is not hypoelliptic in general, whereas in the second

case, as in the Riemannian case, we use the Laplace-Beltrami operator making it

possible to use a weaker positivity assumption than in the first case when we replaced the orthogonal Ricci curvature by a Bakry-E´mery tensor. In order to show

the diameter upper bound, we follow Kuwada's approach in [11] and consider a

stochastic process with this operator as a generator that might be non-symmetric.

We then prove an upper bound on the diameter which is sharper than the diameter

upper bound in the Riemannian case.

2. Preliminaries on Ka¨hler and quaternionic Ka¨hler manifolds We start by reviewing basics of Ka¨hler and quaternionic manifolds.

2.1. K¨ahler manifolds. Let M be an n-dimensional complex manifold equipped

with a complex structure J and a Hermitian metric g. The complex structure

J : TRM  TRM is a real linear endomorphism that satisfies for every x  M , and

X, Y  TR,xM , gx(JxX, Y ) = -gx(X, JxY ), and for every x  M , Jx2 = -IdTxM .

A Hermitian metric on M is a positive definite Hermitian inner product

gp : TpM  TpM  C

which varies smoothly for each p  M . Here, varying smoothly means that if

are smooth for all i, j = 1, · · · , n. Locally, a Hermitian metric can be written as

In this setting we have two natural connections. The Chern connection c is

compatible with the Hermitian metric g and the complex structure J, and the

Levi-Civita connection  is a torsion free connection compatible with the induced

Riemannian metric. The components of the curvature 4-tensor of the Chern con-

nection associated with the Hermitian metric g are given by

The Hermitian metric g is called Ka¨hler if d = 0, where d is the exterior derivative d =  + , and the Chern and Levi-Civita connections coincide precisely when the Hermitian metric is Ka¨hler. There are several equivalent ways to show

BONNET-MYERS THEOREM ON KA¨ HLER AND QUATERNIONIC KA¨ HLER MANIFOLDS 5

eq:hsc

that a metric is Ka¨hler, and one of them is that a metric g is Ka¨hler if and only if
for any p  M , there exist holomorphic coordinates (z1, · · · , zn) near p such that gij(p) = ij and (dgij )(p) = 0. Such coordinates are called holomorphic normal coordinates.

The holomorphic sectional curvature with the unit direction  at x  M (i.e., g(, ) = 1) is defined by
H(g)(x, ) = R(, , , ) = R(v, Jv, Jv, v),

where v is the real tangent vector corresponding to . We will often write H(g)(x, ) = H(g)() = H().

Following [19] we define the orthogonal Ricci curvature on a Ka¨hler manifold (M, g, J) by

(2.1)

Ric(v, v) = Ric(v, v) - H(v),

where v is a real vector field and Ric is the Ricci 2-tensor of (M, g). Unlike the Ricci tensor, Ric does not admit polarization, so we never consider Ric(u, v) for
u = v. For a real vector field v, we can write

Ric(v, v)Ric(v, v) = R(v, Ei, Ei, v),

where {ei} is any orthonormal frame of {v, Jv}. We will assign index 1, 2 to v and

Jv in this summation expression for complex n dimensional Ka¨hler manifold M n,

2.2. Quaternionic K¨ahler manifolds. We start by recalling the following definition of quaternionic Ka¨hler manifold following [6, Proposition 14.36].
Definition 2.1. A Riemannian manifold (M, g) is called a quaternionic Ka¨hler manifold if there exists a covering of M by open sets Ui and, for each i there exist 3 smooth (1, 1) tensors I, J, K on Ui such that
· For every x  Ui, and X, Y  TxM , gx(IxX, Y ) = -gx(X, IxY ), gx(JxX, Y ) = -gx(X, JxY ), gx(KxX, Y ) = -gx(X, KxY ) ;

On quaternionic Ka¨hler manifolds, we will be considering the following curvature tensors. As above, let

(2.2)

R(X, Y, Z, W ) = g((X Y - Y X - [X,Y ])Z, W )

be the Riemannian curvature tensor of (M, g). We define the quaternionic sectional curvature of the quaternionic Ka¨hler manifold (M, g, J) as

Q(X )

=

R(X, IX, IX, X)

+

R(X, JX, JX, X) g(X, X)2

+

R(X, KX, KX, X) .

Following [5, Section 2.1.2] we define the orthogonal Ricci curvature of the quaternionic Ka¨hler manifold (M, g, I, J, K) by

(2.3)

Ric(X, X) = Ric(X, X) - Q(X),

where Ric is the usual Riemannian Ricci tensor of (M, g) and X is a vector field such that g(X, X) = 1.

Lastly, given a vector field V on a Riemannian manifold along a geodesic  defined on [a, b], the index form I associated to V is defined as

b

I(V, V ) =

|V (s)|2 - R(V (s),  (s),  (s), V (s)) ds,

and using polarization the form I can be extended to a bilinear form on the space

of vector fields along the geodesic .

3. Bakry-E´mery orthogonal Ricci tensor of the gradient type
Given a Riemannian manifold (M, g) and a smooth function  : M  R, we denote the Hessian of  by Hess(), i.e., Hess()(X, Y ) = g(X , Y ) for any real vector fields X, Y . In this section, we define and consider the orthogonal BakryE´mery tensor Ric +Hess() with a smooth function  on either a Ka¨hler manifold or a quaternionic Ka¨hler manifold. On a Ka¨hler manifold M n with k  R, we say Ric + Hess() (2n - 2)k if for any unit vector v
Ric(v, v) + Hess()(v, v) (2n - 2)k,
and similarly, we assume Ric(v, v) + Hess()(v, v) (4n - 4)k for a quaternionic fKsritoa¨imhonlesru3pcmr.3hoapas:nh5itfoeownldsso. rthTienheSreeBlcaattikioornyn-s4sE´h..imBpIanekdrbryyeeEettmwdee,enretyshnNooernomScryotomhndmoseiigfitdoreeindrcaeBdl oLicnahpntlheaircs'isasnfeocrtaminoudnlaiosrintdhiPoffgreoorpennoat-l Ricci curvature, without any assumptions on holomorhpic (or quaternionic) sectional curvature. With the modified Bochner formula, assumptions on a smooth function  are important when trying to prove diameter theorems.
Previously Riemannian manifolds endowed with a weighted volume measure e-f dVg satisfying a lower bound on the standard Bakry-Em´ ery Ricci tensor has

BONNET-MYERS THEOREM ON KA¨ HLER AND QUATERNIONIC KA¨ HLER MANIFOLDS 7

been studied in several settings. For example, a Riemannian manifold (M, g) is called a gradient Ricci soliton if there exists a real-valued smooth function f on M such that the Ricci curvature and the Hessian of f satisfy Ric + Hess(f ) = g for some   R. Gradient Ricci solitons play an important role in the theory of Ricci flow as in [8]. Bakry-Em´ ery Ricci tensor plays fundamental role in [23], and it has been extended to metric measure spaces using the Lott-Villani-Sturm theory initiated by [15, 21]. In particular, if (M, g) is a Ka¨hler manifold and it is a gradient Ricci soliton with a real-valued smooth function f , then f is a real holomorphic vector field, i.e., its (1, 0)-part is a holomorphic vector field. Moreover, the weighted Hodge Laplacian from considered with respect to the weighted volume measure e-f dVg maps the space of smooth (p, q) forms to itself for 0 < p + q < 2n if and only if f is a real holomorphic vector field by [16, Proposition 0.1]. Also, the real holomorphic vector field serves as a critical point of the Calabi functional which yields the Calabi's extremal Ka¨hler metric that can be used to study the existence of the Ka¨hler-Einstein metric on Fano manifolds [7]. Lastly, on a compact Ka¨hler manifold with Ricci curvature bounded below by a positive constant k, if the first nonzero eigenvalue achieves its optimal lower bound 2k then the gradient vector field of the corresponding eigenfunction must be real holomorphic by [22].
In our case, we are interested in bounds on Ric + Hess(), where  is a realvalued smooth function, and the holomorphic sectional curvature is not controlled, hence it is different from the case where bounds on the Bakry-E´mery tensor are used.
For compactness of a complete Riemannian manifold with an upper bound on the diameter, one needs additional assumptions on the function whose Hessian is used to define the Bakry-E´mery Ricci tensor as pointed out by [23]. The next example indicates that we need to address such an issue for the orthogonal BakryE´mery tensor as well.

Then both the orthogonal Ricci curvature and the holomorphic sectional curvature

are zero, and Hess() = gE and (Ric + Hess())(v, v) = gE(v, v) for any real

vector field v. This example shows that a complete K¨ahler manifold with positive

lower bound of Ric + Hess() is not necessarily compact.

As we observed from the example, to prove that a complete Ka¨hler (and also quaternionic Ka¨hler) manifold with a positive lower bound on the orthogonal Bakry-E´mery tensor is compact we need to have additional assumptions on , and we will start with the case when  is bounded. In this case, we have the following elementary lemma to control such a function . This fact has been used in the proof of [14, Theorem 1] for a Bakry-E´mery Ricci tensor on Riemannian manifolds.

(also see [18, p.151]) Equivalently, with (Ei)2i=n1 be an orthonormal frame with E1 = f and E2 = J E1,
2n
f = f - Hess(f )(E1, E1) - Hess(f )(JE1, JE1) = Hess(f )(Ei, Ei).
i=3
Similarly, the orthogonal Laplacian of a real-valued smooth function f on a quaternionic Ka¨hler manifold (M, I, J, K) is defined by

f : = f - Hess(f )(E1, E1) - Hess(f )(IE1, IE1)
- Hess(f )(JE1, JE1) - Hess(f )(KE1, KE1)
2n
= Hess(f )(Ei, Ei),
i=5
where (Ei)2i=n1 is an orthonormal frame around p with E2 = IE1, E3 = JE1, E4 = K E1 .
Since the orthogonal Laplacian is neither a self-adjoint operator nor a hypoelliptic operator in general, it might be difficult to study this operator and its applications. Nevertheless, the modified Bochner type formula corresponding to the orthogonal Ricci curvature can be established. We hope this form may have several applications on the geometric analysis side in the future. In opurorpp:3aper, we use the following modified Bochner's formula to use in Proposition 3.5. The idea of the proof is a Bochner's formula modified to fit the orthogonal Ricci tensor.

Proposition 3.3 (Bochner's formula: Ka¨hler's case). Let (M n, g, J) be a Ka¨hler
manifold of the complex dimension n. Let f be a real-valued smooth function on M and  be the orthogonal Laplacian. Then for any orthonormal frame (Ei)2i=n1 around q  M with E1 = f , E2 = JE1,

and we obtain the desired formula.

Remaprrkop3:.52. To compare with the usual Bochner's formula, the formula in Proposition 3.3 uses the orthogonal Ricci tensor, the orthogonal Laplacian, and

(3.2)

(g(Ei f, Eif ) - 2g(f Ei, Eif ) + g(f f, EiEi))

instead of the Ricci tensor, the Laplace-Beltrami operator, and the Hessian norm

squared of f respectively. If we choose an orthonormal frame satisfying EiEj(qe)q=:3.2 0 at some fixed point q for any i, j = 1, · · · , 2n, then each of three termeqs:3in.2(3.2) are zero at q. However, this does not imply that the first two terms in (3.2) vanish

somewhere. For example, if we take f to be the geodesic distance r emanating from

q  M, 2, but

With similar computations, one can obtain the quaternionic version of the modified Bochner's formula.

Proposition 3.4 (Bochner's formula: quaternionic case). Let (M n, g, I, J, K) be
a quaternionic K¨ahler manifold of the quaternionic dimension n. Let f be a realvalued smooth function on M and  be the orthogonal Laplacian. Then for any orthonormal frame (Ei)4i=n1 around q with E2 = IE1, E3 = J E1, E4 = KE1,

By Bochner's formula in Proposition 3.3 applied to the function f being equal
to the geodesic distance r emanating from a point p  M outside of the cut-locus
of p, although all terms g(rr, EiEi), i = 3, · · · , 2n vanish, we still need to control the term

4. Bakry-E´mery orthogonal Ricci tensor associated with the possibly non-symmetric generator of a diffusion process

In this section we consider Bakry-E´mery orthogonal Ricci tensor for the orthog-

onal Ricci curvature while imposing an additional assumption on the holomor-

phic sectional curvature on Ka¨hler manifolds (quaternionic sectional curvature in

the case of quaternion Ka¨hler manifolds). Let M be a real n-dimensional con-

nected smooth manifold with n 2, either equipped with a Ka¨hler structure or

a quaternionic Ka¨hler structure. Choose a complete Riemannian metric g which

is compatible with underlying Ka¨hler or quaternionic Ka¨hler structure and define

L :=  + Z, where  is the Laplace-Beltrami operator associated with g and Z a
smooth vector field. We denote the Riemannian distance on M associated with g by r. Let us define (0, 2)-symmetric tensor (Z)b by

(Z)b(X, Y

)

:=

1 2

(

X Z, Y

+ Y Z, X ).

Given a constant m  R with m n, we define the Bakry-E´mery type orthogonal Ricci tensor Ricm,Z by

In this definition, the convention is that for m = n the vector field Z  0.

Throughout this section, we will assume that with some constant m, k > 0, Ricm,Z (2m - 2)k. This condition means that for a smooth curve (t)

Ricm,Z ( (t),  (t)) = Ric( (t),  (t)) - (Z)b( (t),  (t)) -

1 m - 2n

Z((t)),  (t)

(2m - 2)k.

Proposition 4.1. Suppose (M n, g, J) is a K¨ahler manifold of the complex dimen-

sion n 2. We denote by r the Riemannian distance on M from p associated

with the metric g, and by Cutp the cut-locus of p. Suppose that for some constant

k > 0, Ricm,Z

s(4k, r(x)) s(4k, r(x))

,

where s(k, t) := sin kt.

Proof. When m = 2n, we have Z  0 and we can use the same argument as we use below. Thus without loss of generality, we will assume m > 2n.

Let p  M and x = p which is not in the cut-locus of p. Let  : [0, r(x)]  M be the unique arclength parameterized geodesic connecting p to x. At x, we consider an orthonormal frame {X1(x), ..., X2n(x)} such that
X1(x) = (r(x)), X2(x) = JX1(x).

Then

2n
Lr = r(x) + Zr(x) = 2r(Xi(x), Xi(x)) + Zr(x).

i=1

Since X1(x) = (r(x)), 2r(X1(x), X1(x)) is zero. Now we divide the above sum

into three parts: 2r(X2(x), X2(x)),

2n i=3

2r(Xi(x),

and

Z r(x).

For 2r(X2(x), X2(x)), since J is parellel and  is a geodesic, the vector field defined along  by J is parellel. Define the vector field along  by

Proof.

Suppose

that

there

are

p, q



M

such

that

d(p, q)

>

 2k

.

We

may

assume

that M is compact and that Ricm,Z (2m - 2)k, holds on the open ball of radius

 2k

centered

at

p

by

modifying

outside

of

a

radius.

Then

there

is

an

open

neighborhood G

of

q

such

that

d(p, y)

>

for

all

 G.

Take

p

from

a

small neighborhood of p. Then Proposition yields that Pp[p = ] = 1. It implies

Pp[Xt  G] = 0 for any t > 0. This is absurd since the law of Xt has a strictly

positive density with respect to the Riemannian volume measure for t > 0.

acian_comparison

The similar propositions of the quaternion Ka¨hler case can be obtained by repeating the proofs of the Ka¨hler case. We follow the structure of the proof in [5, Theorem 3.2].

Proposition 4.3. Given a quaternionic K¨ahler manifold (M n, g, I, J, K) of the

quaternionic dimension n 2 and we denote the Riemannian distance on M

from p associated with g by r and Cutp the cut-locus of p. Suppose that for some

constant k > 0, Ricm,Z

r(x) <

 2 3k

.

Then

(4m - 4)k and Q

12k. Let x  M \Cutp  {p} with

Lr(x)  where s(k, t) := sin kt.

s(k, r(x)) s(k, r(x))

+

s(12k, r(x)) s(12k, r(x))

,

Proof. When m = 4n, we just need to put Z  0 and proceed the same argument that we provide below. Thus without loss of generality, we will assume m > 4n.
Let p  M and x = p which is not in the cut-locus of p. Let  : [0, r(x)]  M be the unique arclength parameterized geodesic connecting p to x. At x, we consider an orthonormal frame {X1(x), ..., X4n(x)} such that
X1(x) = (r(x)), X2(x) = IX1(x), X3(x) = JX1(x), X2(x) = KX1(x).

Then

Lr = r(x) + Zr(x) = 2r(Xi(x), Xi(x)) + Zr(x).

Since X1(x) = (r(x)), 2r(X1(x), X1(x)) is zero. Now we divide the above sum

into three parts:

4 i=2

and

For

note

that

might

be

parallel along . Denote X2, X3, and X4 the vector fields along  obtained by

parallel transport along  of X2(x), X3(x) and X4(x). Then one can deduce that

R(, X2, X2, ) + R(, X3, X3, ) + R(, X4, X4, )

= R(, I, I, ) + R(, J , J , ) + R(, K, K, ) = Q()

(see [5, Theorem 3.2] for more details). Define the vector field along  by

The rest steps are similar as in the Proposition 4.1. Consequently, Lr(x) = (m - 4) s(k, r(x)) + s(12k, r(x)) . s(k, r(x)) s(12k, r(x))

prop:quaternion-Kahler-Laplacian_comparison
Combining the proposition above with Proposition 4.3, we obtained:

Proposition 4.4. Given a quaternionic K¨ahler manifold (M n, g, I, J, K) of the

quaternionic dimension n 2, suppose that for some constant k > 0, Ricm,Z

Then

the
