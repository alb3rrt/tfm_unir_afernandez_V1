S1. Details of the analytical model of a single (macro)ion
location within a fluctuating droplet
Here we discuss details of the analytical model that predicts a (macro)ion's location in a fluctuating droplet. The key points of the model are presented in the main text.
The following discussion is an extension of our previous work on the energy of a continuum dielectric droplet containing a single (macro)ion.S1,S2 In the model the droplet surface fluctuations are considered. The total energy of the droplet (E) is written as the sum of surface energy (Esurf ) and electrostatic energy (Eel),S2,S3

E = Esurf + Eel = A + Eel

where  = (, ) is the spherical angle, (, ) is the distance from the centre (which is at the ion), and Ylm(, ) denote the spherical harmonics functions of rank m and order l. For certain shapes of droplets, such as bottle-necked shapes or shapes like an eight we should

R is the l = 0 term in the expansion of (). The details of the algebra for expressing Esurf in terms of the expansion coefficients al,ml (see Eq. S4) is given in Ref.[S1]. The coupling of the electrostatic energyS4 to the shape fluctuations is a tedious step and one of the ways to do that is found in Ref.[S2].

Using the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) approach we found the most probable parameters {K, r0, d} in order to match the observed values of the distance of the ion from the center of mass. In Fig. S1 we show the fitted and the observed distributions for a single sodium ion in a droplet of 1000 TIP3P (transferable intermolecular potential with three points)S5 water molecules. The data were obtained in 15 ns molecular dynamics simulations using the NAMD package.S6 The fittings were produced with the use of statistical analysis software R.S7 For comparison we contrast the fit that takes into account the surface of the droplet with a fit to a gamma distribution of shape 1/2 in Fig. S1 (b). The analysis

S-6

shows that the shape fluctuations of the droplet accounts for the distribution of the ions in the droplet. The fitting can only establish an upper bound of the parameter K. All the variability of the charge distribution is explained by the confinement effect of the droplet surface. In Fig. S1 the fitting parameters used in Eq. (S14) are r0 = 14.9°A and d = 1.1°A. The effective radius of the droplet is smaller than that of the true molecular surface of water.
Here we demonstrate the effect of geometric vs electrostatic confinement in a droplet composed of 1000 H2O molecules and a single ion with charge 1e+ and 3e+. The data are summarized in Table S1.
For a droplet composed of 1000 H2O molecules (equimolecular radius = 1.93 nm) and a 1e+ ion, if we assume  = 80 at T = 300 K then Eq. S10 yields K = 0.39 [mJ/m2] and Eq. S12 yields r 2 = 16 [nm2]. The simulations for the same system yield r 2 = 1.36 [nm2]. These data are shown in the first line of Table S1. The fact that the estimated value of
r 2 is larger than the droplet's radius squared implies that the geometric confinement dominates over the electrostatic confinement.
In the second line of Table S1, we use the r 2 = 1.36 [nm2] (from simulations) and the data are fitted with a gamma distribution to yield K. In the third line of Table S1, the same dated are fitted with Eq. S14, which yields an upper bound for K.
In the fourth and fifth lines of Table S1, we show data for a droplet composed of 1000 H2O molecules and a 3e+ ion. The fitting with a gamma distribution of the simulation data yields K = 20.7 [mJ/m2]. This value of K yields  = 38. In the fifth line, we estimate the value of K from Eq. S12, where r 2 is the value estimated from the simulations. Thus, estimation of K by two independent ways yield very similar. The similarity indicates that the electrostatic confinement becomes significant for this system.
The estimated values of the dielectric constant ( = 38) is lower that the typical values of the pure solvent. We believe that the apparent decrease in the dielectric constant is connected with the polarization saturation in the vicinity of the charge ion.

Na(r) decays rapidly for increasing r upon approaching the surface layer (where d5(r) rapidly increases) and for decreasing r upon entering the region where qT (r) is high. The exception is the N = 100 nanodroplet, which does not have a tetrahedral core. At this size, however, layering propagating from the surface extends to the droplet interior, and it is at a minimum in (r) that we find the peak in Na(r). For the larger droplets too, it appears that the ion prefers to be in a trough, except for N = 1100, where layering is relatively weak.

Abstract
The interaction between water and ions within droplets plays a key role in the chemical reactivity of atmospheric and man-made aerosols. Here we report direct computational evidence that in supercooled aqueous nanodroplets a lower density core of tetrahedrally coordinated water expels the Na+ ions to the denser and more disordered subsurface. In contrast, at room temperature, the radial distribution of a single Na+ ion in the droplet core is nearly uniform. We analyze the spatial distribution of a single ion in terms of a reference electrostatic model. The energy of the system in the analytical model is expressed as the sum of the electrostatic and surface energy of a deformable droplet. The model predicts that the ion is subject to a harmonic potential centered at the droplet's center of mass. We name this effect "electrostatic confinement". The model's predictions are consistent with the simulation findings for a single Na+ ion at room temperature but not at supercooling. We anticipate this study to be the starting point for investigating the structure of supercooled electrosprayed droplets that are used to preserve the conformations of macromolecules originating from the bulk solution.

Introduction
The spatial distribution of ions in droplets plays a decisive role in chemical reactivity in atmospheric and man-made aerosols. Applications of the man-made aerosols relevant to this study include spray-based ionization methods used in native mass spectrometry analysis1 and use of droplets as micro- (nano-) reactors for accelerating chemical synthesis.2­4 Aerosol droplets in the lower atmosphere carry a small charge determined by at most a few excess ions whereas droplets in thunderclouds and electrosprays are highly charged. In this article we study the structure of supercooled aqueous mesoscopic clusters charged with a single and multiple ions. Hereafter, we will use the term nanodroplets for these mesoscopic clusters.
The structure and stability of supercooled clusters composed of ionic species and up to a few tens of water molecules has fascinated scientists over several decades. Experiments have detected abundance of certain "magic" cluster sizes associated with clathrate structures5 and have studied their reactivity in atmospheric chemistry.6 Many of the experiments have used Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry where dominant evaporative cooling of clusters over heating due to the absorption of black body radiation from

"electrostatic confinement" (EC). We introduce

In Fig. 1 we plot the value of the spring constant as a function of the relative dielectric constant for a droplet comprising 1000 water molecules and an ion. The electrostatic energy has two limiting cases  = 1 and  =  when the electrostatic interaction of the ion with the droplet surface vanishes. In the former case the external and internal dielectric constants are equal and the droplet does not perturb the electric field of the ion. In the latter case the electrostatic field is localized in the vicinity of the ion and it is not affected by the droplet surface. As seen in the plot the maximumof the coefficient K() is attained at  = 1 + 3  2.73.

The EC is more pronounced when the ion is localized at the center of the droplet, therefore we can write r 2 /R2 1. Analyzing Eqs. (2) and (4) we conclude that the effect will be more pronounced at low temperature, high charge, small radius and intermediate values of the dielectric constant. Small droplet with high charge may undergo Rayleigh instability37­40 leading to the "star"-shaped droplets41 (see Fig. S2 in SI). If this is an issue in observations we need to increase the droplet radius while keeping constant the value of the Rayleigh parameter X  Q2/R3.42 To illustrate the EC we model high charges by creating models of charged cyclic peptides. DNA and RNA strands are other examples where the effect of the EC will be clearly observed.

In Fig. 2 the distribution of the distance of

the center of mass of the peptide relative to the

COM of the droplet is plotted. The droplet's

equimolecular radius is 3.8 nm and the charge is 8e+. The distribution tapers off before reach-

In summary, there is always a force on an

ion toward the droplet's COM. The electro-

static confinement effect is more pronounced for

an ion with a charge of at least ±3e (where e

is the elementary positive charge) found in a

droplet with a small radius. The radius size

is equal or moderately larger than the radius

at the Rayleigh limit.37­40 The Rayleigh limit

is defined as the point where the electrostatic

forces balance the surface forces. For a radius

smaller than that at the Rayleigh limit, the

droplet shows instability, which is manifested

by "star"-shapes.

Each nanodroplet has been placed in a periodic cubic box of length L (see Table 1). The box is large enough to avoid any interaction between the water droplet and its periodic images. The length of cutoff for interactions (Coulomb and Lennard-Jones) is at L/2, which is much larger than the droplet's diameter in order to reproduce long range electrostatic interactions within the droplet. The simulations are carried out in the canonical ensemble ­ constant number of molecules N , volume V , and T . The temperature is controlled by using the Nos´eHoover thermostat with time constant 0.1 ps. The equations of motion are integrated with the leap-frog algorithm with a time step of 2 fs.
The simulations are initiated with a condensed pure water nanodroplet where the Na+ ion is placed at the surface for the majority of the single Na+ runs, and in the center for two runs, N = 360 and 776 at T = 200 K. All runs with multiple Na+ ions start with the ions near the droplet center of mass.
In Table 1, the mean number of molecule, Nd, forming the connected cluster (i.e. those not in

the vapor), and the relaxation time  , determined from the neighbor correlation function are shown.30 The values of  provide an estimate for the relaxation time for simulations that include ions. In the temperature range where simulations are performed the solvent evaporation within the simulation box is negligible.
To ensure that the we sufficiently sample an equilibrated system after the addition of a single Na+ ion at 200 K, where the concern for equilibration is the highest, we run two simulations for each of N = 360 and N = 776 nanodroplets. In one set, we set the Na+ ion at or near the centre of the droplet, quench the system through a conjugate-gradient energy minimization, and then proceed with an MD simulation. In the other, we initially place the ion on the surface. Equilibration time is estimated from the time it takes for the results of the simulations from the two different conditions to converge. For example, for N = 776 after 400 ns, the ion densities as a function of radial distance from the droplet COM Na(r) converge for the

5

two simulations. For N = 1100, we assume that the equilibration time is longer by a factor of 1100/776  2. For multiple ions, initially distributed in the nanodroplet interior, we presume that the relaxation time is shorter and that the single ions simulations provide upper bounds on the relaxation times.
To help understand the features of Na(r) in terms of the structure of pure water nanodroplets, we report a few other quantities as a function of radial distance from the pure water nanodroplet COM. These include the density of water (r), the density of water as determined from the Voronoi volumes associated with each water molecule v(r), the tetrahedral order parameter qT (r) and the distance to the fifth nearest neighbor O of a given O atom d5.
In our previous study,30 the Voronoi cells for all O sites were computed, while the H sites were ignored. Within each shell of radius r, the total volume V(r) of the Voronoi cells for O sites was found, and the same for the number of O sites in the shell, N (r). The average density as determined by the Voronoi cell volumes is defined as v(r) = m N (r)/V(r) , where · · · indicates an average over the configurations sampled in the simulations, and m is the mass of a water molecule.
To characterize the local structures, we report the tetrahedral order parameter, which is defined at the level of a single particle as,49

Similarly, we report results for d5(r), the average distance to the fifth O neighbor for O atoms
located in the same spherical shell centered at

Figure 3 shows (r) and v(r) for pure water nanodroplets of all sizes studied at high (300 K for N  200, 260 K for N  200) and low (200 K) temperature (T ), with data taken from Ref.30 At high T , shown in Fig. 3 (a), (r) is that of a typical liquid droplet, characterized by a flat (slowly decreasing) curve in the interior that decays sigmoidally to (near) zero over approximately an intermolecular distance at the liquid-vapor interface. The exceptions are the curves for N  200, that at 260 K show some ordering or layering particularly near the surface. At low T , shown in Fig. 3 (b), there is significant layering for all nanodroplet sizes, and, as seen particularly well for the larger nanodroplets, an increase in density as r increases towards the surface. Even though (r) profiles are typically used to identify a cluster's boundary, they may mask certain features. The decrease in the density profile close to the cluster's boundary masks the role of the shape fluctuations. Also, the fact that the profiles are built around the cluster's COM, which is not one of the molecular entities in the cluster, may overemphasize the layered structure of the solvent. For this reason, we use additional measures of the solvent structure such as the Voronoi volume, qT and d5. Note that for r < 0.2 nm, good statistics are difficult to obtain for all radial quantities, and results in this regime are quite noisy.
The undulations in (r) associated with layering make it difficult to characterize how the local density changes with r, and for this reason we plot v(r). Fig. 3 (c) shows v(r) monotonically decreasing (or flat) with r for all nanodroplet sizes at high T . v(r) is significantly smoother than (r), as it does not depend on the number density itself, but rather on the Voronoi volume surrounding each water molecule. An important feature of v(r) is that it begins to decay to zero approximately 0.3 nm, or an intermolecular distance, before (r); Voronoi volumes are very large, and Voronoibased density very low, for molecules on the sur-

face. Molecules falling within the range where v(r) is high (near bulk values) are completely surrounded by other water molecules and are not on the surface. Surface molecules can be identified as those located where v(r) is small, and molecules in the subsurface as those located an intermolecular distance below the point at which v(r) has decayed to near zero.
Fig. 3 (d) shows v(r) for nanodroplets at low T . For N  200, there is a significant increase in density in the subsurface layer. The density may well be higher for surface molecules, but v(r) can not characterize this. This increased density at low T appears to be a hallmark of cold water nanodroplets, and has not been reported for simple liquids to our knowledge. It is this heterogeneous environment in pure water that lends an interesting backdrop for studying ion distributions at low T .
In Fig. 3 (e), we plot Na(r) at high T for systems composed of a single Na+ ion within a nanodroplet. Since the ion density is quite high for small nanodroplets, we divide Na(r) by 10 and 3 for N = 100 and 200, respectively. In all cases, the Na(r) is approximately constant in the interior of the droplet, and begins to decay within the subsurface, and decays to zero significantly before (r) does. For a pure dielectric sphere at T = 0, a point charge has lowest energy at the centre of a sphere. At finite T , there will be a finite width associated with the distribution of ion position. The convergence of the trajectories for Na+ starting on the surface and the droplet's COM is shown in Fig. S3 in SI. At T = 300 K the Na+ radial distribution is consistent with the EC effect. Because of the low charge, the geometric confinement effect dominates over the force toward the droplet's COM. For this reason, the Na+ radial distribution does not distinctly peak at the droplet's COM, but it appears to be almost uniform.
Fig. 3 (f) shows a dramatic difference in Na(r) at low T . Rather than being centered at r = 0, the peak of Na(r) is located within 0.1 nm of the peak in v(r) (for N  200). Thus, we see that in a nanodroplet with a heterogeneous radial density, as determined by v(r), the single Na+ ion tends to reside in the

highest density environment. This tendency is consistent with the fact that for constant T and polarization factor (degree of dipole ordering),50 the dielectric constant increases with increasing density. While the surface layer is at very high density, as measured by (r), clearly the surface does not provide a good solvation environment.
For N = 100 at low T , v(r) is approximately constant for r < 0.3 nm, and then decreases with increasing r. While a constant v(r) for r < 0.3 nm suggests that Na(r) should be uniform in this interior region, we see that Na(r) is in fact peaked just below 0.3 nm. We do see, however, that the peak in Na(r) coincides with a local minimum in (r), suggesting that layering may play a significant role in determining where the Na ion resides in such small nanodroplets.
To probe the relationship between ion location and density a little further, we focus on the behaviour of the N = 776 nanodroplet at T = 200 K and T = 300 K in Fig. 4: In panel (a) we replot (r) and v(r) for pure water, showing their full range of values, confirming that the surface layer is approximately 0.3 nm thick; in panel (b) we show a close-up of v(r) that contrasts the monotonic decrease at high T with the monotonic increase towards a subsurface peak; in panel (c) we compare at low T Na(r) as obtained from starting the ion near the centre and starting near the surface ­ thus showing the degree of equilibration we achieve; panel (d) shows that the ion density when five Na+ ions are present in the nanodroplet shifts at low T to have a peak at approximately the same r as for the single ion case; panel (e) shows the radial dependence of the tetrahedrality parameter, which has an approximately constant value at high T , while at low T shows a significant decrease coinciding with the subsurface density peak; and panel (f) shows the radial dependence of d5, a more indirect measure of the quality of the tetrahedral network, again showing a more disordered structure in the vicinity of the subsurface density peak at low T . The results shown in Fig. 4 confirm the idea that the ions, whether single or multiple, prefer the relatively disordered high density subsurface to the

8

relatively ordered low density tetrahedral network of the core. We note that qT (r) begins to increase beyond a minimum located at 1.6 nm, a location clearly in the surface layer where d5 is quite high and v is nearly zero. We thus cut off the qT (r) at this minimum, as the increase is not indicative of increased tetrahedral order.
Single Na+ number density radial distributions and measures of structure for low temperature (T = 200 K) as those shown in Fig. 4 for select nanodroplet sizes N = 100, 360, 776 and 1100 are presented in Sec. S3 in SI. The same trend in the structure of the H2O and the location of the ions is found as for N = 776. The cluster of N = 100 does not show a tetrahedrally organized core. It is noted that this smaller cluster is subject to larger relative shape fluctuations than the larger droplets. The shape fluctuations and the high pressure in its center play a role in the core structure.

In Fig. 4 (d) and Fig. 5, the radial distributions of multiple ions are compared at T = 300 K and 200 K in droplets comprising 776 and 1100 H2O molecules, respectively. At T = 300 K the distributions are almost uniform with an incipient broad maximum appearing in the outer layers of the droplet.

Solution29 of the Non-linear PoissonBoltzmann (NPB) equation for a rigid spherical geometry suggests that toward the droplet interior the ion distribution will show an exponential decay

n(r) = n(R) exp[(r - R)/P B] (6)

where n is the ion number density, R is the sphere radius (here taken to be equal to Re) and r is the distance from the droplet center. P B is given by

PB 

kB T q

(7)

where kB is Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, is the permittivity, q = me is the charge

of an ion (e is the elementary positive charge)

and  is the surface charge density given by



=

|Z |e 4R2

(|Z |e

is

the

total

droplet

charge).

In finding the surface charge density we as-

sume that all the charge is in the surface. The

larger the P B the slower the ion distribution decay. The simulated ion decay cannot be ex-

actly as the theoretical prediction because of

the droplet's shape fluctuations. The exponen-

tial decay will manifest more clearly in larger

droplets at lower temperature. Obviously, the

higher temperature will lead to a slower ion decay. For 776 H2O molecules - 5 Na+ ions at
T = 300 K the distribution decays (toward the

droplet's COM) as an exponential function fit-

ted by 0.42 exp(-(1.14 - x)/1.2), where P B  1.2 nm. For 1100 H2O the fitting function is 0.40 exp(-(1.37-x)/1.3), where P B  1.3 nm. Equation 7 with dielectric constant of water

equal to 75, yields P B  0.8. In droplets of up to a few thousands of water molecules the effect

of shape fluctuations is significant, therefore, we

interpret the value of P B only in a qualitative manner. The value of P B is comparable in size with the droplet radius, which indicates that

the radial distribution function will show a very

slow decay toward the COM, which is in quali-

tative agreement with the simulations. The ion

distributions at T = 200 K shows a decay that

cannot be analyzed using the NPB. The multi-

ple ions are expelled from the drop's core and

they show a maximum at the same location as

9

the single ion. In droplets comprising 1100 H2O molecules - 8 Na+ ions two peaks are observed at distance 0.52 nm and at 1.5 nm. The lower intensity peak at 0.52 nm corresponds to one ion, which can exchange with the ions that give rise to the outer peak (at  1.5 nm). Therefore, the appearance of two peaks does not indicate a metastable state.
Conclusions
We found that in supercooled aqueous droplets, a heterogeneous solvent structure leads to a different ion distribution relative to that at a room temperature. Specifically, we demonstrated that at supercooling a tetrahedral interior network can form, that expels a single and multiple Na+ ions from the core region to the more disordered subsurface. Voth et al. have studied the location of a single Na+ in clusters with up to 100 H2O molecules.14 Our results are in agreement with those of Voth et al. for the location of the Na+ ion in cluster of 100 H2O molecules. We analyzed the precise role of the solvent in the location of the ions, which has not been examined in previous research.
We presented a reference model for justifying the location of a single-(macro)ion in a fluctuating droplet. The model considers the energy of a charged dielectric droplet as the sum of the electrostatic energy and surface energy. It is found that the ion is always subject to a harmonic potential centered at the droplet's center of mass. This electrostatic confinement effect is evident for certain droplet dimension and charge of the ion. The model predictions may deviate from the simulated ion distributions at supercooling, when the low density core may affect the location of the ions. The model can be extended further by including other factors such as the ion size and hydrophobic effects. The theory can serve as a reference model for comparing with the simulation data.
Evaporative cooling of droplets is a process that has been reported be important in a droplet's lifetime in ionization methods used in native mass spectrometry. The implications of the distribution of multiple ions in super-

cooled droplets in a Rayleigh fission and ionevaporation mechanism have to be examined. A conical deformation is a key component in the mechanism of ion emission.42 A related intriguing question is whether the formation of a conical deformation in the droplet that emits ions is hindered due to the low density core at supercooling. A future study on these questions will be relevant to atmospheric chemistry, native mass spectrometry and the physics of jets.
We anticipate our study to provide the starting point for investigating the structure of the low temperature droplets containing unstructured peptides and complexes of ions. These studies will assist in interpreting ion mobilitymass spectrometry data on the detection of the conformations of macromolecules in the bulk solution and will provide insight in the chemistry of atmospheric aerosols.
