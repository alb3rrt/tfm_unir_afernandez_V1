The recently discovered material Cs3Fe2Br9 contains Fe2Br9 bi-octahedra forming triangular layers with hexagonal stacking along the c axis. In contrast to isostructural Cr-based compounds, the zero-field ground state is not a nonmagnetic S = 0 singlet-dimer state. Instead, the Fe2Br9 bi-octahedra host semiclassical S = 5/2 Fe3+ spins with a pronounced easy-axis anisotropy along c and interestingly, the intra-dimer spins are ordered ferromagnetically. The high degree of magnetic frustration due to (various) competing intra- and inter-dimer couplings leads to a surprisingly rich magnetic phase diagram. Already the zero-field ground state is reached via an intermediate phase, and the high-field magnetization and thermal expansion data for H c identify ten different ordered phases. Among them are phases with constant magnetization of 1/3, respectively 1/2 of the saturation value, and several transitions are strongly hysteretic with pronounced length changes reflecting strong magnetoelastic coupling.

I. INTRODUCTION
Magnetic triangular lattices show a large variety of interesting physics and have been intensively studied [1­ 5]. For example, the search for spin-liquid candidates caused intense studies of hexagonal and triangular magnetic materials like Cs2CuX4 with X = Cl, Br, Na2IrO3, -Li2IrO3 and Ba3TiIr2O9 [6­10]. In contrast to the theoretical concept of a spin liquid, all these materials show magnetic order at low temperatures. While in the 5d materials spin-orbit coupling plays an important role, the exchange interactions are typically dominating in 3d transition-metal compounds. In Cs3Cr2X9 with X = Cl, Br, which contain a hexagonal arrangement of face-sharing Cr2X9 bi-octahedra, the magnetism is dominated by a strong antiferromagnetic intra-dimer coupling. This yields a singlet ground state and a fieldinduced magnetic ordering which can be described as a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of magnons [11, 12]. Two examples of triangular magnets with rich phase diagrams are the S = 1/2 Heisenberg system Cs2CuBr4 that shows nine field-induced phase transitions and a multitude of fractional magnetization plateaus [13], and the semi-classical S = 5/2 material RbFe(MoO4)2 with five

ordered phases [14]. In these triangular lattices, magnetic moments lie within the plane and the interesting phase diagrams occur for in-plane applied fields. Another example is CuFeO2, where the Fe3+ moments order perpendicular to the triangular planes [15, 16].
Recently, the new material Cs3Fe2Br9 was discovered that is isostructural to Cs3Cr2X9 and crystallizes in the hexagonal space group P 63/mmc with a = 7.5427(8) A and c = 18.5849(13) A.[17] The structure consists of facesharing octahedra forming Fe2Br9 bi-octahedra in triangular layers. The shortest Fe-Fe distance amounts to 3.585(3) A within the bi-octahedra. The in-plane Fe-Fep distance within the triangular layers is about twice as large, 7.179(2) A, and the interlayer Fe-Fec distance of 7.543(1) A is slightly larger. Based on a study of powder samples, a band gap of 1.65 eV and antiferromagnetic order at TN = 13 K were reported [17]. Here, we present a detailed study of the low-temperature ordered phases of Cs3Fe2Br9 single crystals up to the saturation magnetization MS that is reached at 43 T (52 T) for a field parallel (perpendicular) to the c axis.

FIG. 1. Panel (a) shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility i for H c (red) and H c (black). The green line stems from a Curie-Weiss analysis of  for T > 100 K. Inset (i) shows  / revealing an essentially isotropic susceptibility in the high-temperature paramagnetic phase. Panel (b) shows the zero-field specific heat with a huge anomaly around 13.2 K arising from the magnetic order, which actually evolves via a two-step transition with TN1 = 13.29 K and TN2 = 13.12 K as shown in inset (ii). Panel (c) shows the thermal expansion in 0 T measured along the hexagonal c axis and along two perpendicular directions e1 and e2 within the ab plane. Inset (iii) shows the corresponding uniaxial thermal expansion coefficients  = 1/L0 · Li/T , which again signal the two-step transition.

six months. Further studies revealed that Cs3Fe2Br9 can be grown from solutions of CsBr and FeBr3 in the range of 3:2 and 4:1 between room temperature and 50 °C.
Using commercial setups (Quantum Design PPMS and MPMS), specific heat and magnetic susceptibility were measured between 2 K to 300 K, and the low-temperature magnetization was measured up to 14 T. High-field magnetization data were obtained using pick-up coils in pulsed magnetic fields up to 56 T at the high-field center HLD, Dresden Rossendorf. Thermal expansion and magnetostriction L(T, H)/L0 were measured in a homebuilt capacitance dilatometer down to 0.26 K in magnetic fields up to 17 T [18, 19]. The field was applied parallel to the crystal direction whose length change Li was measured. L0 denotes the corresponding overall length of the sample, and the uniaxial thermal expansion coefficient  = 1/L0 · Li/T was obtained numerically. Additonally, high-field expansion data up to 37 T were taken at HFML Nijmegen using commercial dilatometers [20, 21].
The crystal structure of Cs3Fe2Br9 was investigated via an APEX (Bruker) four-circle single crystal X-ray diffractometer at 150 K. [22] The low-temperature crystal and magnetic structure was studied on the singlecrystal neutron diffractometer HEiDi [23] and on the KOMPASS instrument (both at FRM-II, Munich). On HEiDi, a crystal of 48.680(14) mg was mounted in a way that the (0 1 1) direction was oriented along the  axis of the four circle diffractometer and data were collected with wavelengths  of 1.171 A and 0.795 A. On KOMPASS, the measurements were performed in the (100)/(010) and (100)/(001) scattering planes. A polarized beam was obtained through serial polarizing V-shaped multichannel cavities and a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG(002)) monochromator,  = 4 A. An additional V-shaped multichannel cavity was used to analyze the polarization of the scattered beam in the experiments

with the second scattering plane yielding a flipping ratio of 11. Higher order contamination was suppressed with a velocity selector.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1(a) shows the temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility for H c and H  c. In the hightemperature regime, i is isotropic and well described by a Curie-Weiss law. Fixing the spin of the Fe3+ ions to S = 5/2 the Curie-Weiss analysis of  c yields a Curie temperature  = -56 K and a reasonable g-factor of 2.09.[24] Below 13 K,  c drops to zero while c remains almost constant suggesting nearly collinear antiferromagnetic order with moments pointing essentially along c. The magnetic system is weakly frustrated as is indicated by the frustration factor ||/TN  4.4. Figure 1(b) shows the specific heat, which reveals a huge anomaly around 13.2 K. As shown in the inset (ii), we resolve two distinct transitions at TN1 = 13.29 K and TN2 = 13.12 K.[25]
Figure 1(c) shows thermal expansion data measured along the hexagonal c axis and along the two in-plane directions e1 and e2, which are parallel and perpendicular to the hexagonal in-plane axes a, respectively. At the transition each data set shows a step-like relative length change with Lc/L0 10-4 (blue) and Lei /L0 3 · 10-4 for both, e1 a (red) and e2  a (green). The enlarged view on the thermal expansion coefficients  in the inset (iii) reveals that each of them also shows two distinct peaks [26]. As will be discussed below, the magnetic transition breaks the 3-fold in-plane symmetry and allows for three twin domains of orthorhombic symmetry. Thus, a finite magnetoelastic coupling should induce different thermal expansion anomalies of e1 and e2 in a single-domain sample. However, in the capacitance dilatometer the crystal is fixed by CuBe springs,

FIG. 2. Crystal (left) and magnetic (right) structure of Cs3Fe2Br9. The top panels are 3D versions and the bottom panels show the respective projections to the ab plane. In the lower left panel, the solid and open lines connect the Fe2Br9 bi-octahedra of the lower- and the upper triangular planes, respectively. The magnetic structure was determined for the zero-field phase P1 at 2.5 K, which shows essentially parallel Fe spins within the bi-octahedra. The magnetic unit cell leaves c unchanged, while the hexagonal in-plane axis a is doubled, which results in an orthorhombic unit cell. This is illustrated by the dashed rectangle in the projection to the ab plane, where the open (filled) circles mark Fe ions from the upper (lower) Fe2Br9 layer, with their magnetic moments pointing either along +c (red) or -c (blue). Besides the intradimer interaction J (not shown) we discuss the interdimer interactions Jp (green) and Jp (yellow) acting on nearest-neighbor dimers in the same layer, and the interlayer interaction Jc (blue) coupling nearest-neighbor spins in adjacent dimer layers. The photo shows a single crystal with pronounced facets reflecting the hexagonal structure.
which apply a weak uniaxial pressure along the measured Li and may cause a partial or full detwinning at the symmetry-breaking phase transition [27, 28]. In this case, the Li/L0 measured along e1 and e2 result from different orientations of twin domains, as is discussed in the Appendix B.
The crystal structure of Cs3Fe2Br9 is displayed in Fig. 2. The fundamental building blocks are Fe2Br9 bioctahedra forming triangular planes, which are arranged in the usual ABAB stacking of the hexagonal crystal structure. In the ab projection of the crystal structure (Fig. 2 lower left panel), the bi-octahedra of the different triangular planes are connected by open and solid gray lines. The right panel of Fig. 2 shows the Fe3+ magnetic moments, which are aligned parallel to each other within the Fe2Br9 dimers for the zero-field ordered phase (see below), and the most important interdimer mag-

netic exchange interactions are also indicated. Neglecting the interlayer coupling Jc, the bi-octahedron dimers form frustrated triangular planes which have been long studied [29]. The triangular arrangement is depicted by using open (closed) symbols for the Fe spins of the upper (lower) planes of the 3D unit cell in Fig. 2. When adding the interlayer coupling, Jc, on an equal footing to Jp, and when ignoring the intradimer coupling J as well as Jp, one can also argue about a realization of staggered honeycomb magnetic planes. Note that for antiferromagnetic Jp and Jc both are frustrated, but Jp couples to six neighboring spins of the same triangular plane, while Jc couples to three neighbors of the next triangular plane.

The crystal structure was refined in space group

P 63/mmc at 150, 15, and 2.5 K yielding no significant differences between the two lowest temperatures and only

slight changes in the Br positions when comparing 150 K

and low-temperature structures, see Appendix A 1. At

2.5 K, i.e. well in the magnetically ordered phase P1,

we searched for magnetic Bragg peaks. As is shown in

Fig. 3(a), a mapping of the (hk0) plane in reciprocal

space yields additional magnetic Bragg peaks at various

also looked for magnetic Bragg peaks appearing at a half-

integer l component but did not observe such intensities.

The antiferromagnetic order with these propagation vec-

tors corresponds to the stripe order in a single triangular

layer that is illustrated in the lower right part of Fig. 2.

The different domains correspond to the propagation vec-

tors and to the stripes rotated by 0, 60 and 120 degrees.

Temperature dependent neutron diffraction experi-

ments were performed on HEiDi and on KOMPASS.

Fig. 3(b) and (c) show the amplitudes and the squares

of the widths obtained by fitting Gaussian profiles to

the scans. The half-indexed magnetic Bragg intensities

show only moderate temperature dependence in the or-

dered phase and abruptly disappear at the lower transi-

tion temperature TN2 in accordance with the first-order character of this phase transition. The scan width only

increases above TN2. In order to more deeply study the phase transition additional experiments using polariza-

tion analysis were performed on KOMPASS, Fig. 3(d)

and (e). These experiments reveal sizeable diffuse scat-

tering above TN2 that persists also well above TN1. At the latter, higher transition temperature we find no sig-

nature in the temperature dependence of the diffuse scat-

tering at the half-indexed scattering vector positions. For

Gaussian profiles to the h, k (KOMPASS) or rocking scans

(HEiDi) across magnetic peaks. Only for the KOMPASS

data quadratic widths are given after substraction of the low-

temperature values (data are vertically shifted for clarity).

Panels (d) and (e) show the same analysis for data obtained

with polarization analysis (SF with neutron polarization axis

along the vertical direction) that focus on the temperature

range close to the transition. Panels (f) and (g) show the in-

tensities at the magnetic Bragg positions as a function of tem-

ordering scheme in phase P2. Second, there is no indication for a qualitatively distinct behavior when scanning parallel and perpendicular to the planes. In contrast, for a quasi-two dimensional system one would expect two-dimensional correlations to survive above the N´eel temperature while the correlation perpendicular to the planes will broaden more rapidly. Therefore, Cs3Fe2Br9

is essentially a three-dimensional magnetic system. With

the polarization analysis, one may directly determine the

orientation of the magnetic moments. We set the neutron

polarization axis perpendicular to the scattering plane

defined by (1,0,0) and (0,0,1), therefore the spin-flip (SF)

position there are no nuclear contributions. The data in

Fig. 3(f) and (g) are corrected for the finite flipping ratio

and unambiguously reveal that the magnetic intensities

at the half-indexed reflections completely arise from mo-

ments pointing along c, which agrees with the vanishing

magnetic susceptibility c(T  0), Fig 1(a). The diffuse scattering visible between TN2 and TN1 and above TN1 exhibits the same magnetic anisotropy so that also the short-range correlations are associated with moments

along c.

The

for

the

(

propagation

vec-

tor in space group P 63/mmc was performed with the

FullProf program package [30] and is discussed in the

Appendix A 2. The four Fe ions in the primitive cell are

all equivalent in the magnetic phase. Furthermore, sus-

ceptibility and neutron polarization analysis reveal that

the essential part of the magnetic moment aligns along

the c direction. Only 2, 3, 6, and 7 possess a finite c component, so that the other magnetic models can be ex-

cluded. The four irreducible representations correspond

to antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic dimers (two spins

in the bi-octahedron) combined with a ferro- or antiferro-

magnetic stacking within the unit cell. Refinements were

performed with these four magnetic structures taking the

three domain orientations into account. The data is only

compatible with 3 yielding a weighted R value of 7.7%, while 77, 73 and 80% are obtained for 2, 6, and 7, respectively. The parallel alignment of the moments within

a dimer can already be deduced from the fact that the

strongest magnetic peaks are found in the (hk0) plane,

while for an antiferromagnetic alignment these intensi-

ties exactly cancel (because the two Fe ions exhibit the

same x and y coordinates). Also the antiferromagnetic

stacking of the spins within the cell that arises through

Jc is unambiguous.

The symmetry analysis indicates that the c moments

in 3 can be accompanied by an in-plane moment, i.e. a weak canting. Within a dimer the ferromag-

netic c moments are coupled with antiferromagnetic in-

plane moments arising from Dzyaloshinski-Moriya inter-

action. The magnetic refinement with the Fullprof pack-

age only slightly improve with the in-plane moment yield-

ing a total moment of 3.954(5) µB, a moment along c of 3.925(5) µB and an in-plane component of 0.47(14) µB. The three domains occupy similar volume fractions of

39, 30 and 31%. The size of the in-plane moment is

consistent with the small reduction of the in-plane sus-

ceptibility in the ordered phase. The magnetic structure

is illustrated in Fig. 2 neglecting the in-plane component.

Here, the spin directions up and down are marked in red

5

and blue, respectively, while spins from the upper (lower)

Fe3+ double-layer are depicted by open (closed) sym-

bols. Only two thirds of the in-plane nearest-neighbor

(NN) spins show antiparallel orientations and, analo-

gously, only two thirds of the NN spins across the neigh-

boring planes of the AB-stacked bi-octahedra are an-

tiparallel to each other. Thus, all the NN inter-dimer

couplings Jp, Jp, and Jc are geometrically frustrated.

The

stripe

order

described

by

the

(

1 2

propaga-

tion vector is one possible lowest-energy arrangement of

the triangular frustrated magnetic lattice [29]. It breaks

rotational symmetry and the degeneracy can be lifted

by magnetoelastic coupling, as it is discussed in Ap-

pendix B. The magnetic structure and the magnetoe-

lastically distorted structure can be described in the or-

thorhombic space group Cmcm (No. 63) which results

from P 63/mmc by breaking the three-fold axis. A re-

finement of the additional structural parameters in the

lower space group improves the R values [31] only slightly

[32] and a similar improvement can be achieved for the

data measured at 15 K, so the structural symmetry re-

duction induced by the magnetoelastic coupling cannot

be resolved in the neutron diffraction study.

As discussed in the Appendix C, we mapped the

DFT+U total energies of several magnetic configurations

onto the Heisenberg model written as i>j JijSiSj, and from these calculations the intra- and the interdimer cou-

plings were determined, see Fig. 2. The intradimer J

results from the Fe-Br-Fe exchange paths via the com-

mon Br ions of the face-sharing bi-octahedron with bond

angles of 83.5° and is found to be weakly ferromagnetic

with J = -1 K and -1.4 K for U = 5.8 eV and 6.5 eV,

respectively. Interestingly, this coupling is smaller (by

absolute magnitude) than the interdimer couplings Jp and Jc, which both result from two Fe-Br-Br-Fe exchange paths. Here, we obtain values Jp = 2.8(3.2) K and Jc = 3.0(2.8) K for U= 5.8(6.5) eV, whereas, for

both U, a significantly smaller Jp = 0.2 K is obtained for the diagonal interdimer couplings which result from

single Fe-Br-Br-Fe exchange paths. These parameters are

in perfect agreement with the magnetic structure deter-

mined at zero field and 2.5 K. Based on these couplings,

one can consider Cs3Fe2Br9 as a system of frustrated S = 5/2 triangular layers, which are moderately coupled

along c. Due to the hexagonal AABB stacking of the

single Fe3+ layers, the interlayer coupling alternates be-

tween the weakly ferromagnetic J, for AA and BB, and

the larger, but frustrated antiferromagnetic Jc for AB. On a mean-field level, the Weiss temperature is given by

 = - ziJiS(S + 1)/3 -2.92 ziJi (1)

i

i

with S = 5/2 and the coordination numbers zi = 1, 6, 6, and 3 for the couplings J, Jp, Jp, and Jc, respectively. Depending on U, the ab-initio values yield
 -76(-80) K. In view of the fact that mean-field
theory typically overestimates || and only near-neighbor
couplings are considered, these values well agree to the

experimentally observed  -56 K. Due to the inherent frustration of the triangular arrangement of the Fe spins, one may expect that relatively small magnetic fields can already induce variations of the magnetic structure.
Pulsed high-field magnetization data of Cs3Fe2Br9 at 1.5 K are shown in Fig. 4(a). For H  c, M (H) is almost linear up to the saturation field of 52 T, and the saturation magnetization MS of 10 µB/fu agrees well with two S = 5/2 Fe3+ ions per formula unit. The differential susceptibility  = M/H reveals two peaks at 39 T and 52 T indicating phase transitions. Based on additional data, we derive the phase diagram in Fig. 4(d) containing two ordered phases P1 and P2, which continuously evolve from the two zero-field transitions.
In contrast, multiple transitions occur for H c. Both,  and M (H) remain almost zero up to HC1 = 5.6 T, where M (H) starts to increase linearly up to HC2 = 12 T. At HC2,  shows a peak corresponding to a step-like increase of M (HC2) followed by another region of constant  . At HC3 = 14 T, M shows another step to an approximately constant M (H > HC3) 3.33 µB/fu which equals 1/3 of MS. Another step-like increase occurs at HC4 = 20 T followed by a wide plateau with M 1/2MS up to HC5  32 T. Above this field,  becomes significantly enhanced again up to HC7  41.5 T with an intermediate peak at HC6 = 38 T and MS is finally reached above about 43 T. This yields an easy-axis anisotropy
 = Han/Hex = 2(HS - HS )/(HS + HS )  0.2, which is a rather large value for a S = 5/2 material. For comparison,   0.1 is found for RbFe(MoO4)2 [14], and for CuFeO2 an almost isotropic   0.02 is reported [33, 34]. Note that from our ab-initio values of the exchange parameters a saturation field HS = 4((Jp + Jp) + 2Jc)kBS/gµB 33 T would be expected. This value is below the experimental results for both field directions, indicating that apart from an anisotropy term additional exchange couplings between more distant spins should be taken into account.
Figure 4(b) summarizes representative expansion data Lc(T, H c) measured in static fields up to 37 T. At 0.26 K, there is a kink in Lc(HC1 = 5.2 T) signaling a second-order phase transition. At HC2 = 11.2 T, the length increases discontinuously by about 1.7·10-4 followed by another, slightly smaller discontinuity at HC3 = 13.2 T. The inset (ii) resolves the pronounced hysteresis between the field-increasing and the field-decreasing run. Because the respective critical fields are shifted by about 3 T, the hysteresis regions of the two field-induced transitions overlap and, consequently, around 10.6 T and 0.26 K, each of the three phases can be realized depending on the field-sweep protocol. Typical first-order solidstate transitions are quasi-discontinuous, resulting, e.g., in more or less S-shaped length changes due to a finite transition width and/or phase coexistence. In contrast, the low-temperature transitions in Cs3Fe2Br9 are extraordinarily sharp with discontinuous relative length changes of about 10-4, which systematically change towards continuous variations in Lc(H) upon increasing

FIG. 4. Panel (a) displays the pulsed-field magnetization and the differential susceptibility measured at 1.5 K up to 55 T. The data for H c (blue) reveal 7 phase transitions and 2 transitions for H  c (red), as marked by the vertical lines. Note that there are 2 plateau phases (P5 and P6) with constant magnetization of, respectively, 1/3 and 1/2 of the saturation MS. The main panel of (b) shows magnetostriction curves Lc(H)/L0 obtained with increasing H c up to 15 T for representative temperatures from 0.26 to 10 K, and the inset (i) contains an additional curve up to 37 T. The kinks or jump-like changes in Lc(H) signal, respectively, 2nd- or 1st-order phase transitions with 10 ordered phases (P1 to P10) and the paramagnetic (PM) state. The existence regions of the various phases are marked via the changing colors of Lc(H, T ). Strong hysteresis effects occur at 0.26 K as is shown in the inset (ii). The insets (iii) and (iv) display corresponding thermal-expansion Lc(T ) curves in the field range from 15.5 to 19.5 T. Panels (c) and (d) show the phase diagrams for H c and H  c, respectively. Here, the phases are colored as in panel (b) and the vertical lines mark the critical fields HC1-7 as in panel (b).

temperature. The insets (i), (iii), and (iv) display further magnetostriction Lc(H) and thermal expansion Lc(T ) measurements which signal different sequences of field- or temperature-induced magnetoelastic transitions in different regions of the phase diagram.
Combining all anomalies of the thermal-expansion, magnetostriction and magnetization data reveals the phase diagram in Fig. 4(c). In zero field, there is a twostep transition with an intermediate phase P2 between the paramagnetic phase and the ground state P1. Below 5 K, P1 shows a second-order transition to P3 at 5 to 7 T, which is followed by a cascade of very sharp firstorder transitions around 9, 13, and 20 T to the phases P4, P5, and P6, respectively. Below 4 K, these firstorder transitions become strongly hysteretic. On further increasing field, phase P7 is reached through a secondorder transition at 32 T followed by another first-order

transition to P8 around 38 T, and MS is finally reached at 43 T. The phases P1, P5, and P6 are characterized by essentially constant magnetization plateau values of M = 0, 1/3 MS, and 1/2 MS, respectively, while the other low-temperature phases P3, P4, P7, and P8 show more or less linear M (H) behavior with similar slopes  . Above 7 K and below 18 T, three other phases are stabilized. The intermediate phase P2, which covers only a small temperature interval of 0.2 K between TN1 and TN2 in zero field, continuously grows with increasing field until it finally dominates the intermediate field range from about 8 T to 18 T at elevated temperature. The additional phases P9 and P10 only form comparatively small pockets. Phase P9 separates P2 from the low-temperature 1/2 MS plateau phase P5, and P10 is located between P2 and the high-temperature paramagnetic phase from 10 T to 19 T.

In a first attempt, we consider Cs3Fe2Br9 with S = 5/2 as stacked triangular layers of classical spins, which allows us to compare our data to numerical studies of the field-temperature phase diagram obtained via MonteCarlo simulations [35, 36]. The simulations considered triangular layers with antiferromagnetic in-plane NN and NNN interactions J1/2 for a moderate frustration ratio J2/J1 = 0.15 that is sufficient to suppress the so-called 120 zero-field groundstate of pure Heisenberg spins [37]. Along c, a simple AA stacking with ferromagnetic interlayer coupling J/J1 = -0.15 was kept constant, while the single-ion anisotropy energy -DSz2 was varied from zero up to the strong Ising case D/J1 = 1.5. Interestingly, the simulation for D/J1 = 0.5 [35] reproduces several basic aspects of the experimental phase diagram of Cs3Fe2Br9 surprisingly well. The obtained zero-field groundstate corresponds to P1, and a first field-induced transition of second-order is expected at hc1 hS/8, in agreement with the transition from P1 to P3 at HC1 = 5.2 T. Moreover, fractional magnetization-plateau states with 1/3 MS and 1/2 MS are predicted, which are entered via first-order transitions, as it is observed for the phases P5 and P6. Upon increasing field, the plateau phases are expected to alternate with intermediate states of finite  , which correspond to Bose-Einstein condensates of magnons and are entered via second-order transitions. Thus, we tentatively assign the experimentally observed phases P3 and P7 to such Bose-Einstein condensates.
The additional phases P2, P4, P8, P9, and P10 have no counterparts in the model calculations. Of course, this is not very surprising, because the model used in Refs. 35 and 36 does not capture the specific aspects of Cs3Fe2Br9. In particular, the AABB stacking of Cs3Fe2Br9 with frustrated antiferromagnetic coupling via Jc may induce additional phases. With increasing longitudinal field H c, we can anticipate, e.g., the formation of partial spin-flop phases or incommensurate phases. Indeed, preliminary neutron data indicate that the intermediate zero-field phase P2 is incommensurate and, as shown in Fig. 4, this phase P2 is stabilized for both field directions, H c and H  c, but different microscopic spin structures are expected in longitudinal and transverse fields. Thus, further diffraction studies on the field-induced magnetic phases appear very promising to understand this extremely rich phase diagram.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we have identified the new material Cs3Fe2Br9 as a frustrated triangular antiferromagnet with surprisingly rich properties. The magnetic ordering occurs with a strong magnetoelastic distortion. In contrast to some Cr-based isostructural materials, the spins of the Fe2Br9 bi-octahedra do not form a dimer singlet ground state, but are in fact ferromagnetically aligned. This agrees with our ab-initio DFT+U calculations, which yield a weak ferromagnetic intradimer

coupling J between the Fe spins within the Fe2Br9 bioctahedra. In contrast, the interdimer coupling Jp within the triangular planes is antiferromagnetic and frustrated. A similar antiferromagnetic exchange is obtained for the interlayer coupling Jc which acts between spins of neighboring AB layers and is frustrated as well. As a consequence, Cs3Fe2Br9 consists of AABB-stacked triangular layers with alternating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling along c, which adds to the complexity. The magnetic anisotropy  = 0.19 derived from the saturation fields HS and HS appears extraordinarily large for spin-5/2 moments of the Fe3+ ions with half-filled 3d shells. The strongly different saturation fields are also remarkable because the magnetic susceptibility in the paramagnetic high-temperature phase is essentially isotropic. The phase diagram with the magnetic field along the easy axis is very complex and shows a plethora of field-induced phases, which include two phases with fractional magnetization plateaus, namely 1/2MS and 1/3MS, and we have indications of at least one incommensurate magnetic phase. Several first-order phase transitions appear with huge hysteresis effects, and sharp lattice deformations occur. All this makes Cs3Fe2Br9 an extremely interesting material with very rich and unusual properties.
While finalizing this manuscript we became aware of a very recent publication about the closely related material Cs3Fe2Cl9 [38]. The magnetic phase diagrams derived for this iso-structural material strongly resemble those of Fig. 4, but with reduced TN = 5.4 K, reduced saturation fields HS = 19.4 T, HS = 17.4 T and smaller anisotropy  = 0.1. Although the proposed interpretation of Ref. 38 concerning the relative importance of various exchange couplings differs from our conclusions, it is gratifying that the basic experimental features of both materials, Cs3Fe2Cl9 and Cs3Fe2Br9, are very similar. This confirms that this extremely rich behavior is indeed an intrinsic property of these materials, although the detailed clarification of the magnetic structures of the different field-induced phases requires further studies.

Appendix A: Structural details
1. Crystal structure
The crystal structure was analyzed at 150 K using Xrays [22] and at 15 and 2.5 K with neutrons. On the four-circle neutron diffractometer HEiDi nuclear reflections were collected using the wavelengths 1.171 °A and 0.795 °A whereas magnetic reflections were only collected with =1.171 °A. Reflections that were corrupted by a varying background or by a too close neighboring Bragg peak were culled manually, so the following numbers refer to the remaining reflections. For the structural refinement, 1291 reflections were collected at 15 K (649 of which are unique with respect to space group P 63/mmc and 282 unique reflections were observed) and 1109 reflections were collected at 2.5 K (350 of which are unique and 272 unique reflections were observed). For the magnetic data collection at 2.5 K, 336 magnetic reflections were collected (310 of which belong to different Friedel pairs and 94 of which were observed).
The structural refinements were performed with the software package SHELXL-2018/3 [39] for the X-ray data taken at 150 K, and with the Jana2006 [40] software package for the low-temperature neutron data. The resulting parameters are given in Table I. The lowtemperature structural parameters are identical within the error bars for 15 and 2.5 K but there are slight differences with the results obtained at 150 K. The largest deviations can be found in the x and y coordinates of the Br atoms.
2. Magnetic structure
The symmetry analysis of the zero-field magnetic structure was performed with the Fullprof program package and is presented in Table II.

Here we consider the occurrence of magnetoelastic domains resulting from the magnetic order of the zero-field phase P1. As shown in Fig. 2 the in-plane nearest neighbor spins along one of the three originally equivalent hexagonal a directions are aligned parallel to each other, but alternate along the other two a. This results in a 2-fold in-plane symmetry with the orthorhombic ao (bo) axis along (perpendicular to) the line of parallel spins. For a single-domain crystal, different thermal expansion anomalies are naturally expected for ao and bo, if there is a finite magnetoelastic coupling. This can be rationalized by assuming that with the onset of magnetic order the in-plane bond length of the antiparallel spin pairs weakly shrinks while the in-plane bond length of the parallel spin pairs weakly increases. For a multi-domain crystal, however, the different thermal expansion anomalies of the ao

and bo axes are expected to cancel each other, at least partially. Thus, the rather large and essentially identical Lei /L0 measured along the different orientations e1 and e2 may appear surprising. However, in the used capacitance dilatometer the crystal is fixed by CuBe springs, which apply a uniaxial pressure parallel to the measured Lei . This pressure can cause a partial detwinning at the symmetry-breaking phase transition [27, 28] and, consequently, the almost identical Lei /L0 measured along e1 and e2 result from different orientations of twin domains. Note that the dilatometer measurements along e1 and e2 cannot be performed simultaneously.
For a quantitative discussion of the detwinning effects, we consider the variations of the magnetoelastic energy Emag/r  r and of the (nearly) harmonic lattice potential Elatt/2r  r2 to lowest order of a generalized lattice distortion r. Here, the different powers in r necessarily cause finite lattice distortions in order to minimize the total energy Emag + Elatt and these distortions reflect the magnetic symmetry. Consequently, independent spontaneous strains ao, bo, and co along each of the orthorhombic axes are expected for the P1 phase of Cs3Fe2Br9. If the variations of Emag and Elatt are restricted to the respective lowest order in r, straightforward geometric considerations reveal that ao = -bo. In this case, the hexagonal-to-orthorhombic transition is area-conserving with respect to the triangular planes, while co denotes the bare volume change. Therefore, no sizeable in-plane length changes should be measured in a fully twinned multi-domain sample, which means that the very large and essentially identical contractions Lei /L0 measured along the in-plane directions e1  e2 result from the shape changes of differently oriented twin domains.
Because e1 and e2 are, respectively, parallel and perpendicular to one of the hexagonal a axes, these directions correspond to ao and bo of one domain and are rotated by ±60 with respect to the corresponding orthorhombic axes of the other two domains. If we now consider the case that ao shrinks at the ordering phase transition, the first domain will be favored by uniaxial pressure along e1 and a single-domain state can be reached for large enough pressure. For uniaxial pressure along e2, the other two domains are favored and a single-domain state cannot be reached. When n1 denotes the population of the pressure-induced favored domain, n2 = 1 - n1 corresponds to the fraction of the other domains, and the total length changes Lei /L0 measured either along e1 or along e2 are given by

From Eqs. (B3, B4), it is clear that, for ao = -bo, the same overall length change can be expected along
e1 and e2 if the uniaxial pressure applied either along e1 or e2, respectively, results in the same detwinning ratio r. However, for pressure along e2 a maximum detwinning ratio r = 0.5 can be reached because two do-
mains are equally favorable. As is shown in Fig.1(c), we
observed essentially identical contractions along e1 and e2, which restricts the detwinning ratio to 0 < r  0.5 and the intrinsic orthorhombic distortions correspond to 1/r · Lei /L0. Using the measured Lei /L0 3 · 10-4 allows us to give the lower bounds |ao|, |bo|  6 · 10-4, but we cannot judge which of the orthorhombic axes con-
tracts or expands.

Appendix C: Details of DFT+U calculations
All calculations were performed using the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method as realized in

calculations. Molecular Ir-Ir orbitals are seen in the lower panel (a1g marks bonding and a1g antibonding states of the corresponding symmetry) in contrast to the ordinary atomic

the wien2k code [41]. We used the Perdew-BurkeErnzerhof version of exchange-correlation functional [42]. The supercell used for the total energy calculations consisted of four formula units. The irreducible part of the Brillouin zone was sampled by a 9×5×9 k-point grid. Strong Coulomb correlations were taken into account using the DFT+U method [43], and Hubbard onsite electron repulsion and Hund's intra-atomic exchange parameters were chosen to be U = 5.8 and 6.5 eV and JH = 0.95 eV as for other similar materials [44, 45].
The upper panel of Fig. 5 illustrates results of nonmagnetic GGA calculations of Cs3Fe2Br9. One can see that the electronic structure in this case is very different from what we have in another dimer-material

Ba3CeIr2O9 with a very similar crystal structure [46], whose density of states are presented in the lower part of
Fig. 5. In Ba3CeIr2O9 one clearly sees the formation of the bonding (a1g) and antibonding (a1g) bands. There is nothing like this in Cs3Fe2Br9, where one may distinguish the atomic t2g and eg states only. Thus, in spite of naive expectations Cs3Fe2Br9 should not be considered as a material with molecular orbitals formed by the Fe-3d
states and a there is no large exchange coupling between
sites as a result. The reason for this is a large ionic radius of Br1- (1.96 °A) compared to O2- (1.4 °A) [47], which results in a large a interatomic distance of 3.6 °A between the Fe3+ ions.

surements in the PPMS is not well applicable for firstorder transitions. Thus, long heat pulses over a temperature range of about 0.5 K were analyzed, similar to Ref. 48. [26] The thermal-expansion anomalies are shifted by 100 mK compared to the anomalies of p. This difference exceeds the typical experimental uncertainties arising from the usage of different samples in different experimental setups and indicates a weak upwards shift of the transition temperatures due to the uniaxial pressure which is applied when the sample is clamped into the capacitance dilatometer.
