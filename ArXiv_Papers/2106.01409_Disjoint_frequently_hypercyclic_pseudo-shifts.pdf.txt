DISJOINT FREQUENTLY HYPERCYCLIC PSEUDO-SHIFTS
O¨ ZGU¨ R MARTIN, QUENTIN MENET, AND YUNIED PUIG
Abstract. We obtain a Disjoint Frequent Hypercyclicity Criterion and show that it characterizes disjoint frequent hypercyclicity for a family of unilateral pseudo-shifts on c0(N) and p(N), 1  p < . As an application, we characterize disjoint frequently hypercyclic weighted shifts. We give analogous results for the weaker notions of disjoint upper frequent and reiterative hypercyclicity. Finally, we provide counterexamples showing that, although the frequent hypercyclicity, upper frequent hypercyclicity, and reiterative hypercyclicity coincide for weighted shifts on p(N), this equivalence fails for disjoint versions of these notions.
1. Introduction
The aim of this paper is to study the notion of disjointness for frequently hypercyclic operators. Frequent hypercyclicity is one of the central notions in linear dynamics and it has been studied extensively since its introduction in 2006 by Bayart and Grivaux [1]. On the other hand, disjointness in linear dynamics was introduced in 2007 independently by Bernal [4] and by B`es and Peris [7], and although, disjoint hypercyclic operators have been well studied, to the best of our knowledge, no work has been appeared on disjoint frequently hypercyclic operators. We refer to the recent monographs [2] and [12] for an introduction to linear dynamics.
Weighted shift operators play an important role in linear dynamics. Recall that, for a bounded weight sequence (wn)n1 in C, the unilateral weighted backward shift Bw on c0(N) or p(N) is defined by Bw(e1) = 0 and Bw(en) = wnen-1 for n  2, where (en) is the canonical basis. Despite their simple form, with their wide-ranging (chaotic) dynamical properties, they provide a good source for examples and counterexamples (one can see [15] or the recent papers [3], [6], and [9] among many). Unfortunately, disjoint dynamics of hypercyclic weighted shifts are very limited. As shown in [5], they can never be disjoint weakly mixing and, thus, never be disjoint mixing nor satisfy the Disjoint Hypercyclicity Criterion. In [10], C¸ olakoglu, Sanders and the first author characterized disjoint hypercyclicity of pseudo-shifts which are a generalization of the weighted shift operators.

Tf,w : X  X is given by





Tf,w( xj ej ) = wf(j)xf(j)ej ,

j=1

j=1

where {ej : j  1} is the canonical basis of X.

Observe that, this family of operators includes the unilateral weighted shifts and their

powers which are the source of many examples and counterexamples for disjoint hypercyclic

operators (see [5], [7] and [14]). Indeed, weighted shifts are pseudo-shifts with the inducing

map f (n) = n + 1, n  N, and a weighted shift raised to the power r  N is a pseudo-shift

with the inducing map f (n) = n + r.

In Section 2, we give a Disjoint A-Hypercyclicity Criterion which is inspired by [6, The-

orem 9], where A  P(N) is the family of sets of positive lower density, positive upper

density, or positive upper Banach density. We also show that this criterion characterizes disjoint A-hypercyclicity for a family of unilateral pseudo-shifts on c0(N) and p(N), p  1,
which also includes unilateral weighted shifts and their powers.

In Section 3, using a result of Bonilla and Grosse-Erdmann [9, Theorem 15], when A is

the family of sets of positive upper density or positive upper Banach density, we simplify our

characterization of disjoint A-hypercyclic pseudo-shifts and provide it for a larger family of

pseudo-shifts.

In [3] and [6], it was shown that the notions of frequent hypercyclicity, upper frequent hypercyclicity, and reiterative hypercyclicity coincide for weighted shifts on p(N). In Sec-

tion 4, we give counterexamples showing that this is no longer true for disjoint versions of these notions. We also show that, on p(N), two reiteratively hypercyclic weighted shifts

are disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic if and only if they are disjoint hypercyclic. We end the

paper with some open questions.

In the rest of the Introduction, we recall the notions that we will use in the following

sections.

Let N denote the set of natural numbers, X be a separable and infinite dimensional Banach

space over the real or complex scalar field K, and let L(X) denote the algebra of continuous

linear operators on X. An operator T  L(X) is called hypercyclic if there exists x  X such that {T nx : n  N} is dense in X and such a vector x is said to be a hypercyclic vector

for T .

The lower density, the upper density, and the upper Banach density of a set A  N is

defined by

respectively. Let A, AuBd, Aud, and Ald  P(N) denote the family of infinite sets, sets of positive upper Banach density, sets of positive upper density, and sets of positive lower

density, respectively. Let A = A, AuBd, Aud, or Ald. An operator T  L(X) is called A-hypercyclic if there ex-
ists some x  X such that for every non-empty open set U  X we have {n : T nx  U}  A.

Such a vector x is called an A-hypercyclic vector for the operator T . For A = A, AuBd, Aud, or Ald, A-hypercyclic operators are called hypercyclic, reiteratively hypercyclic, upper frequently hypercyclic, or frequently hypercyclic, respectively.
For N  2, operators T1, . . . , TN  L(X) are called disjoint hypercyclic if the direct sum operator T1· · ·TN has a hypercyclic vector of the form (x, . . . , x)  XN . We say T1, . . . , TN are disjoint A-hypercyclic if there exists a vector x in X such that the vector (x, . . . , x) is an A-hypercyclic vector for the direct sum operator T1· · ·TN on XN . Such a vector x is called a disjoint A-hypercyclic vector for T1, . . . , TN . For A = A, AuBd, Aud, or Ald, disjoint Ahypercyclic operators are called disjoint hypercyclic, disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic, disjoint
upper frequently hypercyclic, or disjoint frequently hypercyclic, respectively.

2. Disjoint A-hypercyclicity and pseudo shifts

Inspired by [6, Theorem 9], we first give a Disjoint A-Hypercyclicity Criterion as a sufficient condition for disjoint A-hypercyclicity. As we will have to deal with N operators, we will denote by [N] the set {1, . . . , N}.

Theorem 2.1 (Disjoint A-Hypercyclicity Criterion). Let X be a separable Banach space, T1, . . . , TN  L(X) and A = A, AuBd, Aud or Ald. If there exist a dense set Y0 in X, a dense sequence (yl)l1  Y0N , Sn : Y0N  X, n  0, disjoint sets Ak  A, k  1, and a sequence (k) of positive real numbers tending to 0 such that for each l  1, each j  [N],
(1) nAl Snyl converges unconditionally in X uniformly in l, (2) for any n  k1 Ak,

iAl\{n}
(3) for any n  Al, any k < l,

TjnSiyk  l,

iAk

(4) for any n  Al,

TjnSnyl - yl,j  l,

then T1, . . . , TN are disjoint A-hypercyclic.

Proof. Since nAl Snyl converges unconditionally in X uniformly in l and the sets Al are

disjoint, we can find an increasing sequence (ls)s1

The vector x is thus a disjoint A-hypercyclic vector for T1, . . . , TN .

The above criterion relies on the existence of disjoint sets Ak  A with convenient separation property. We already know that for any sequence of positive integers (Nj), there exists a family (Aj)j1 of disjoint sets in Ald such that for every j  1, min(Aj)  Nj and for every n  Aj, m  Aj with n = m, |n - m|  Nj + Nj (see [1] and [8]). However we will need here a more general result allowing us to deal with other densities, with multiples and allowing us to extract the sequence (Aj)j1 from another sequence (Bj)j1  A.
Lemma 2.2. Let A = A, AuBd, Aud or Ald, let (Bj)j1 be a family of sets in A, let (Nj) be a sequence of positive integers and let Q  N. There exists a family (Aj)j1 of disjoint sets in A such that for every j  1, Aj  Bj, min(Aj)  Nj and for every n  Aj, m  Aj with n = m, for every 1  q, q  Q, |qn - qm|  Nj + Nj.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that (Nj) is increasing.

For the case A = A, a simple diagonalization argument suffices to define the family (Aj)j1 = ({aj,n : n  1})j1. In step 1, we choose a1,1  B1 such that a1,1  N1. In step 2, we choose a1,2  B1 such that a1,2  Qa1,1 + 2N1 and a2,1  B2 such that a2,1  Qa1,2 + N1 + N2. Finally, assume that we have chosen {ai,j : 1  i, j  k - 1 and i + j  k} such that ai,n  Qaj,m + Ni + Nj for any 1  i, j  k - 1 with i + n  j + m or with i + n = j + m and i > j. We can now choose a1,k  B1 such that a1,k  Qak-1,1 + N1 + Nk-1 and then, for i = 2, . . . , k, in increasing order, choose ai,k+1-i  Bi such that ai,k+1-i  Qai-1,k+2-i + Ni + Ni-1. Continuing this way, we will have the desired result if we define Aj := {aj,n : n  1} for every j  1.

For AuBd, we proceed in a similar way. Let 0 < Dj < Bd(Bj). In step 1, we choose
n1,1 = 1 and a1,1  B1 such that a1,1  N1. In step 2, choose a1,n1,1+1, . . . , a1,n1,2  B1 for some n1,2 > n1,1 such that a1,2  Qa1,1 + 2N1, a1,n  a1,n-1 + 2N1 for every n  (n1,1 + 1, n1,2]

and such that there exist N  2 and M  QN + 2N1 such that

card({a1,n

:

n



(n1,1, n1,2]} N

 {M

+ 1, . . . , M

+ N})



D1 2N1

.

This is done by considering N  2 and M  max{Qa1,1 + 2N1, QN + 2N1} satisfying

card(B1



{M

+ 1, N

...,M

+

N })



D1

and by letting a1,n = min{k  B1  {M + 1, . . . , M + N } : k  a1,n-1 + 2N1} for any n > n1,1 while {k  B1  {M + 1, . . . , M + N } : k  a1,n-1 + 2N1} is non-empty.
Note that for any n, m  (n1,1, n1,2] with n = m, any 1  q, q  Q, |qa1,n - qa1,m|  2N1. Indeed, if q = q, it follows from the fact that |a1,n - a1,m|  2N1 and if q > q, we have

qa1,n - qa1,m  qM - q(M + N )  M - QN  2N1.

We then choose a2,1, . . . , a2,n2,2  B2 for some n2,2 such that a2,1  Qa1,n1,2 + N1 + N2 and a2,n  a2,n-1+2N2 for every n  (1, n2,2] and such that there exist N  2 and M  QN +2N2

satisfying

card({a2,n

:

n



[1, n2,2]}  N

{M

+

1, . . . , M

+ N})



D2 2N2

.

Finally, assume that we have chosen {ai,j : 1  i  k - 1 and 1  j  ni,k-1} as above. We

now choose a1,n  B1 with n  (n1,k-1, n1,k] such that a1,n1,k-1+1  Qak-1,nk-1,k-1 + N1 + Nk-1 and a1,n  a1,n-1 + 2N1 for every n  (n1,k-1 + 1, n1,k] so that there exist N  k and

M  QN + 2N1 such that

card({a1,n

:

n



(n1,k-1, n1,k]} N



{M

+

1, . . . , M

+

N })



D1 2N1

.

Next, for i = 2, . . . , k - 1, in increasing order, we choose ai,n  Bi with n  (ni,k-1, ni,k] such that ai,ni,k-1+1  Qai-1,ni-1,k + Ni + Ni-1 and ai,n  ai,n-1 + 2Ni for every n  (ni,k-1 + 1, ni,k] so that there exist N  k and M  QN + 2Ni such that

card({ai,n

n



(ni,k-1, ni,k]} N



{M

.

It remains to choose ak,1, . . . , ak,nk,k for some nk,k such that ak,1  Qak-1,nk-1,k + Nk + Nk-1 and ak,n  ak,n-1 + 2Nk for every n  (1, nk,k] and such that there exist N  k and
M  QN + 2Nk satisfying

card({ak,n

Continuing this way, we will have the desired result if we define Aj := {aj,n : n  1} for every j  1.

For the case A = Ald or A = Aud, we denote by dj the lower density of Bj and by Dj the upper density of Bj. Without loss of generality, we can assume that for every N  1,

To this end, it suffices to show that for any set A  Ald (resp. A  Aud), any r > 1 and any

N  1, it is possible to find a subset A  A such that A  Ald (resp. A  Aud) and such

that for every n = m  A, |n - rm|  N .

More generally, we can find a sequence (mk)k1 with (k - 1)M + K  mk < kM such that

By letting A = A  k[rmk, rmk+1 - N ], we get A  Ald because for any L  r2M , if r(k-1)M  L < rkM , we have

by definition of K.

On the other hand, let A  Aud, D the upper density of A, r > 1 and N  1.

We consider M such that rM - r2  N . We then divide A into M sets A(m) = A 

k1[rkM+m, rkM+m+1 - N ] for m = 0, . . . , M - 1. We remark that the sets A(m) are disjoint

Before investigating pseudo-shifts, it is important to remark that we can extract from pseudo-shifts some weighted shifts with similar dynamical properties. Moreover, we recall that in the case of weighted shifts, we know that the notions of frequent hypercyclicity, upper

frequent hypercyclicity, and reiterative hypercyclicity coincide for weighted shifts on p(N).

More precisely, a weighted shift Bw on p(N) satisfies one of these properties if and only if

(see

[3]

and

[6]).

Proposition 2.3. Let T = Tf,w be an unilateral pseudo-shift on X where X = p(N) with
1  p <  or X = c0(N) and A = A, AuBd, Aud or Ald. If T is A-hypercyclic on X then for every j  1, Bv(j) with vn(j) = wfn-1(j) is A-hypercyclic on X.

Proof. Let j  1 and let  be the map defined by (x) =

 k=1

xf k-1(j)ek.

We

then

get

that

for every x  X,

T x = Bv(j) x.

In other words, since  is continuous and has dense range, the operator Bv(j) is quasiconjugate to T . The desired result then follows from the fact that A-hypercyclicity is pre-

served under quasi-conjugacy.

In order to be able to characterize disjoint A-hypercyclic pseudo-shifts on p(N), we need to restrict ourselves to pseudo-shifts satisfying the following condition.

Definition 2.4. Let fs : N  N, s  [N] be increasing maps and A be a family of subsets of N. The family A is called (fs)Ns=1-weakly partition regular if for any sequence (Bl)l1  A there exists a sequence (Al)l1  A such that for every l  1, Al  Bl and for every l, k  1,
fsm([l])  ftn([k]) =  m  Al, n  Ak, m = n, s, t  [N ].
A characterization of disjoint hypercyclic pseudo-shifts on p(N) has already been given in [10]. Therefore, we focus on the notions of disjoint reiterative, upper frequent and frequent hypercyclicity.

Theorem 2.5 (Characterization for pseudo-shifts on p(N)). Let T1 = Tf1,w1, . . . , TN = TfN ,wN be unilateral pseudo-shifts on p(N) with 1  p <  and A = AuBd, Aud or Ald. If A is (fs)Ns=1-weakly partition regular then T1, . . . , Tn are disjoint A-hypercyclic if and only if there exist sets Ak  A, k  1, and a sequence (k)k1 of positive real numbers tending to 0 such that

Proof. Suppose that T1, . . . , TN possess a disjoint A-hypercyclic vector x. Let j  1 and s  [N ]. From Proposition 2.3, we deduce that the unilateral weighted shift Bvjs with vjs,n = ws,fsn-1(j) is A-hypercyclic on p(N) and it follows from the characterization of Ahypercyclic weighted shifts on p(N) that

n1

1 |Wjs,n|p

< .

We now consider a dense sequence (al)l1  p(N)N such that for every s  [N ],

deg(als)  l and als,j = 0 for every j  l.

Let Cl

=

. l
mins[N],j[l] |als,j |

We then let Al

= {n  0 :

Tsnx - Clals

< l for every s  [N ]}

where (l)l1  (0, 1) decreases to 0.

It follows that for every 1  j  k, every s  [N] and every n  Ak,

|Wjs,nxfsn(j) - Ckaks,j| < k

and thus

0 < k - k  Ck|aks,j| - k  |Wjs,nxfsn(j)|.

In particular, for every 1  j  k, every s  [N ] and every n  Ak, xfsn(j) = 0. On the other hand, for every k  1, every s  [N ] and every n  Ak,

|Wjs,nxfsn(j)|p < kp.
j>k

Therefore, for any 1  j  l, any k  1, any n  Ak, any s = t  [N ],

The condition (a) is thus satisfied. Moreover, we deduce that for every s = t  [N], any n  AL, any j  ftn([l])  fsn([l + 1, L]), we have

and we conclude that the condition (b) is also satisfied.

We now prove the other implication. We thus assume that there exist sets Bk  A, k  1, and a sequence (k)k1 of positive real numbers tending to 0 such that (1) - (4) are satisfied. Since A is (fs)Ns=1-weakly partition regular and thanks to Lemma 2.2, we can consider a

DISJOINT FREQUENTLY HYPERCYCLIC PSEUDO-SHIFTS

11

family of disjoint sets (Ak)k1  A such that for every l, k  1, Ak  Bk and

fsm([l])  ftn([k]) =  m  Al, n  Ak, m = n, s, t  [N ]

and such that for every k  1, min(Ak)  Nk + k + 1 and for every n  Al, m  Ak with

n = m, |n-m|  Nl +Nk +l+k +2 where Nk is chosen so that for any j  k and any s  [N ],

we have

1 nNk |Wjs,n|p

< k.

The sequence (Ak)k1

then satisfies the conditions (2) - (4).

Moreover, in view of the separation property of (Ak), for any n  Ak, any m  Al with

n = m, any j  l, the condition ftm(j)  fsn((k, +)) is equivalent to ftm(j)  fsn([1, +)).

The conditions (2) and (3) will thus be still satisfied if we consider a subsequence of (Ak).

Let (yl)l1  cN00 dense in p(N)N such that for every l  1, every s  [N ], deg(yls)  l, yls p  l and for every j  l, yls,j = 0, where yl = (yls)s[N]. We can then assume, even

if it means considering a subsequence, that the sequence (N l2l)l tends to 0, that for every

O¨ . MARTIN, Q. MENET, AND Y. PUIG

In the case of c0(N), we know from [3] that the characterization of A-hypercyclic weighted shifts is more complicated than in the case of p(N). Similar arrangements will be necessary for the condition (1).

Theorem 2.6 (Characterization for pseudo-shifts on c0(N)). Let T1 = Tf1,w1, . . . , TN = TfN ,wN be unilateral pseudo-shifts on c0(N) and A = A, AuBd, Aud or Ald. If A is (fs)Ns=1weakly partition regular then T1, . . . , Tn are disjoint A-hypercyclic if and only if there exist sets Ak  A, k  1, and a sequence (k) of positive real numbers tending to 0 such that

We

then

let

It follows that for every 1  j  k, every s  [N] and every n  Ak,

|Wjs,nxfsn(j) - Ckaks,j| < k

and thus

0 < k - k  |Wjs,nxfsn(j)|.

In particular, for every 1  j  k, every s  [N ] and every n  Ak, xfsn(j) = 0 and

Moreover, for any 1  j  k < l, any n  Al and any s = t  [N], we have that for all m  Ak with fs-n(ftm(j)) > l, the following holds

We now prove the other implication and thus assume that there exist disjoint sets Bk  A, k  1, and a sequence (k) of positive real numbers tending to 0 such that (1) - (4) are satisfied. We first consider a family (Ak)  A such that Ak  Bk,

Let (yl)l1  cN00 dense in cN0 (N) such that for every l  1, every s  [N ], deg(yls)  l, yls  l and for every j  l, yls,j = 0. We can then assume, without loss of generality, that

Remark 2.7. We remark that the condition (1) in the previous theorems gives us a characterization of A-hypercyclic pseudo-shifts. The obtained statement is comparable to the characterization given for weighted shifts by Grosse-Erdmann in [11]. It is also important to remark that the assumption of weakly partition regularity is only used in the proof of the second implication.

The proofs of the previous theorems show that pseudo-shifts are disjoint A-hypercyclic if and only if they satisfy the Disjoint A-Hypercyclicity Criterion.

Corollary 2.8. Let Tf1,w1, . . . , TfN ,wN be unilateral pseudo-shifts on c0(N) or p(N) with 1  p <  and A = AuBd, Aud or Ald. If A is (fs)Ns=1-weakly partition regular then the operators Tf1,w1, . . . , TfN,wN are disjoint A-hypercyclic if and only if they satisfy the Disjoint A-Hypercyclicity Criterion.

Thanks to Theorem 2.5 and Theorem 2.6, we also get a characterization of disjoint Ahypercyclicity for any family of weighted shifts. Indeed, for weighted shifts, we have fsm([l]) = [m + 1, m + l] for any s  [N ], then it follows from Lemma 2.2 that A, AuBd, Aud and Ald are (fs)Ns=1-weakly partition regular. We state this characterization in the case of p(N).

Theorem 2.9 (Characterization for weighted shifts on p(N)). Let T1 = Bw1, . . . , TN = BwN be unilateral weighted shifts on p(N) with 1  p <  and A = AuBd, Aud or Ald. The family T1, . . . , Tn are disjoint A-hypercyclic if and only if there exist disjoint sets Ak  A, k  1, and a sequence (k) of positive real numbers tending to 0 such that

Proof. It suffices to remark that by Lemma 2.2, we can always assume that for every n  Al, m  Ak with n = m, |n - m|  l + k + 2. The characterization for weighted shifts then follows from Theorem 2.5

We can also apply Theorem 2.5 and Theorem 2.6 to powers of weighted shifts. Indeed,
in this case, we have fsm([l]) = [qsm + 1, qsm + l] for any s  [N ] and some qs  N, and it follows from Lemma 2.2 that A, AuBd, Aud and Ald are (fs)Ns=1-weakly partition regular. Here is an example of applications.

Corollary 2.10. Let T1 = 1Bi1,...,TN = N BiN with 1 < |1|  · · ·  |N | and i1, . . . , iN  1. Let X = p(N) with 1  p <  or X = c0(N). Then the following assertions are equivalent:
(1) T1,...,TN are disjoint frequently hypercyclic on X; (2) T1,...,TN are disjoint upper frequently hypercyclic on X; (3) T1,...,TN are disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic on X; (4) T1,...,TN are disjoint hypercyclic on X; (5) for every 1  s < t  N , is < it and |s| < |t|.

Proof. It is obvious that (1)  (2)  (3)  (4). Moreover, (4)  (5) is a consequence of

[7]. It remains to show that (5)  (1). We only write the proof for p(N), as the proof for

c0(N) is similar. In view of Theorem 2.5, we need to find a sequence (Ak)k1  Ald and a sequence (k)k1 of positive real numbers tending to 0 such that

(1) We first remark that if m  Al and m  n - l with n  B then m  (n + l). Indeed, if n  (M l rl, M lrl+1 - l) with l < l then since m  min(Al)  M lrl + l, we have m  M l rl+1 + l  n + l  (n + l) and if l  l then

3. Disjoint reiterative and upper frequent hypercyclicity cases

In [9], Bonilla and Grosse-Erdmann gave a Birkhoff-type characterization for upper frequent and reiterative hypercyclicity. They also used this result to simplify the characterizations of upper frequently and reiteratively hypercyclic weighted shifts that appeared in the literature. In view of these results, we can also simplify our characterization of disjoint A-hypercyclic pseudo-shifts in the case of AuBd and Aud and give this characterization for a larger family of pseudo-shifts. In order to do this, we introduce the following notion.

Definition 3.1. Let fs : N  N, s  [N] be increasing maps and A be a family of subsets of N. The family A is called (fs)Ns=1-almost partition regular if for any l  1, any B  A there exists A  B, A  A such that
fsm([l])  ftn([l]) =  m, n  A, m = n, s, t  [N ].
Theorem 3.2 (Bonilla and Grosse-Erdmann [9]). Let X be a complete metric space, Y a separable metric space and Tn : X  Y , n  0, continuous mappings. Let A = D µM A,µ be an upper Furstenberg family. If for any non-empty open subset V of Y , there is some   D such that for any non-empty open subset U of X, there is some x  U such that

{n  0 : Tnx  V }  A,µ
µM
then (Tn) admits an A-universal point, i.e. there exists x  X such that for any non-empty open set U in Y , {n  0 : Tnx  U}  A.
By considering the sequence of operators (T1n×· · ·×TNn )  L(X, XN ), we get the following.
Theorem 3.3. Let X be a separable Banach space, T1, · · · , TN  L(X). If for any nonempty open subsets V1, . . . , VN of X, there is some  > 0 such that for any non-empty open subset U of X, there is some x  U such that

dens( {n  0 : Tsnx  Vs}) >  (resp. Bd( {n  0 : Tsnx  Vs}) > )

s[N ]

s[N ]

then T1, · · · , TN are disjoint upper frequently hypercyclic (resp. disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic).

In the case of pseudo-shifts, we can still simplify this criterion since pseudo-shifts have dense generalized kernel.

Theorem 3.4. Let T1 = Tf1,w1, . . . , TN = TfN,wN be unilateral pseudo-shifts on X = p(N) with 1  p <  or c0(N). If for any non-empty open subsets V1, . . . , VN of X, there is some
x  X such that

dens( {n  0 : Tsnx  Vs}) > 0 (resp. Bd( {n  0 : Tsnx  Vs}) > 0)

s[N ]

s[N ]

then T1, · · · , TN are disjoint upper frequently hypercyclic (resp. disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic).

Proof. Let V1, . . . , VN be non-empty open subsets of X and x  X such that

 := dens( {n  0 : Tsnx  Vs}) > 0 (resp.  := Bd( {n  0 : Tsnx  Vs}) > 0).

s[N ]

s[N ]

DISJOINT FREQUENTLY HYPERCYCLIC PSEUDO-SHIFTS

Let U be a non-empty open subset of X. It suffices to remark that there exists y  c00 such that x + y  U and that

dens( {n  0 : Tsn(x+y)  Vs}) =  (resp.  := Bd( {n  0 : Tsn(x + y)  Vs}) = )

s[N ]

s[N ]

since Tsn(y) = 0 for n sufficiently big.

We are now in a good position to give a simplified characterization of disjoint reiterative and upper frequent hypercyclicity for pseudo-shifts. We first focus on the p(N) case.

Theorem 3.5. Let T1 = Tf1,w1, . . . , TN = TfN ,wN be unilateral pseudo-shifts on p(N) with 1  p <  and A = AuBd or Aud. If A is (fs)Ns=1-almost partition regular then the family

T1, . . . , Tn are disjoint A-hypercyclic if and only if

(1) for any j  1 and any s  [N], we have

n1

1 |Wjs,n|p

<

,

(2) for any l  1, any (as,j)s[N],j[l] with as,j = 0, any  > 0, there exists A  A such

that for any s = t  [N], any n  A,

W a ft-n(j),n

Proof. If T1, . . . , TN are disjoint A-hypercyclic, we can apply Theorem 2.5 in view of Remark 2.7. It suffices then to remark that the condition (2)(a) of Theorem 3.5 follows from

the condition (2) of Theorem 2.5 for m = n and from the condition (4)(b) of Theorem 2.5

for m = n.

We now prove the other implication thanks to Theorem 3.4. Let V1, . . . , VN be non-empty

open subsets of p(N). There exist l  1, (as,j)s[N],j[l] with as,j = 0 and  > 0 such that for

Let M  1 such that for any j  l and any s  [N], we have

Since A is (fs)Ns=1-almost partition regular, we can assume that fsm([l])  ftn([l]) =  m, n  A, m = n, s, t  [N ]

and that for any m = n  A, |m - n|  M.

ftm(Jm,t)  fsn(Jn,s) = .

We turn our attention now to the c0(N) case.

Theorem 3.6. Let T1 = Tf1,w1, . . . , TN = TfN ,wN be unilateral pseudo-shifts on c0(N) and A = AuBd or Aud. If A is (fs)Ns=1-almost partition regular then the family T1, . . . , Tn are disjoint A-hypercyclic if and only if for any l, any (as,j)s[N],j[l] with as,j = 0, any  > 0, there exists A  A such that

Proof. If T1, . . . , TN are disjoint A-hypercyclic, we can apply Theorem 2.6 in view of Remark 2.7. It suffices then to remark that the condition (2) of Theorem 3.6 follows from the

condition (2) of Theorem 2.6 for m = n and s = t, from the condition (1) of Theorem 2.6

for m = n and s = t and from the condition (4)(b) of Theorem 2.6 for m = n and s = t.

We now prove the other implication thanks to Theorem 3.4. Let V1, . . . , VN be non-empty

open subsets of c0(N). There exist l  1, (as,j)s[N],j[l] with as,j = 0 and  > 0 such that for

Since A is (fs)Ns=1-weakly partition regular, we can assume that fsm([l])  ftn([l]) =  m, n  A, m = n, s, t  [N ].

Thanks to Theorem 3.5 and Theorem 3.6, we get a simplified characterization of disjoint
reiterative and upper frequent hypercyclicity for any family of weighted shifts. Indeed, for weighted shifts, we have fsm([l]) = [m + 1, m + l] for any s  [N ], and as remarked before AuBd and Aud are (fs)Ns=1-weakly partition regular, hence in particular (fs)Ns=1-almost partition regular. We state this characterization in the case of p(N).

Theorem 3.7. Let T1 = Bw1, . . . , TN = BwN be unilateral weighted shifts on p(N) with 1  p <  and A = AuBd or Aud. The family T1, . . . , Tn are disjoint A-hypercyclic if and

4. Examples
As shown in [3] and [6], the notions of reiterative hypercyclicity, upper frequent hypercyclicity and frequent hypercyclicity coincide for weighted shifts on p(N). This is in contrast with the disjoint case as the following two results show.

Theorem 4.1. There exist two upper frequently hypercyclic weighted shifts Bv and Bw on p(N) with 1  p <  such that Bv and Bw are disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic but not disjoint upper frequently hypercyclic.

Proof. Let nl = 10l for any l  1 and let (yl)l1 be a dense sequence in p(N) such that

deg(yl) = l

and

otherwise,

where Wl1,n =

It

follows

by

that

every i  [l],

We also remark that Bv and Bw are continuous since |vn|  2 for every n and supn |wn| <

Moreover, Bv is upper frequently hypercyclic since for every l  1, every n  [nl, nl+1),

We now show that the operators Bv and Bw are disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic thanks

We can therefore deduce from Theorem 3.7 that Bv and Bw are disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic.

and since dens l1[nl, nl + 2l] = 0, it follows from Theorem 3.7 that the shifts Bv and Bw cannot be disjoint upper frequently hypercyclic.

Therefore,

since

we

get

dens

l1[nl, 2nl +l] = 0 and it follows from Theorem 2.9

that Bv and Bw cannot be disjoint frequently hypercyclic.

Conversely it is not possible to find two reiteratively hypercylic unilateral weighted shifts on p(N) which are disjoint hypercyclic but not disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic. We show this in the next result.
Theorem 4.3. Let T1 = Tf1,w1, T2 = Tf2,w2 be unilateral pseudo-shifts on p(N) with 1  p < . If AuBd is (f1, f2)-almost partition regular and f1 = f2 then T1, T2 are disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic if and only if T1, T2 are reiteratively hypercyclic and disjoint hypercyclic.
Proof. If T1, T2 are disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic, it is obvious that T1, T2 are reiteratively hypercyclic and disjoint hypercyclic.

Suppose now that T1 = Tf1,w1, T2 = Tf2,w2 are reiteratively hypercyclic and disjoint hypercyclic with f1 = f2. We show that T1, T2 are disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic by using
Theorem 3.5.

Since T1 and T2 are reiteratively hypercyclic, we already know that for any j  1 and any

s  [2], we have

1 n1 |Wjs,n|p

Moreover,

since

T1,

T2

are

disjoint

hypercyclic,

we

get

that for any l  1, any (bs,j)s[2],j[l] with bs,j = 0, any  > 0, any N  0, there exists n  N

Question 5.1. Is it possible to find two reiteratively hypercylic operators T1 and T2 which are disjoint hypercyclic but not disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic? Can T1 and T2 be taken as unilateral weighted shifts on c0(N)?
We say that finitely many operators are densely disjoint A-hypercyclic if the set of their disjoint A-hypercyclic vectors are dense. If T1, . . . , TN are disjoint A-hypercyclic unilateral pseudo shifts on p(N) or c0(N) for A = A, AuBd, Aud, or Ald, then it is obvious that T1, . . . , TN are densely disjoint A-hypercyclic since the perturbation of a disjoint Ahypercyclic vector of (T1, . . . , TN ) by any vector z  c00 is still a disjoint A-hypercyclic vector of (T1, . . . , TN ).
In [16], Sanders and Shkarin showed that every Banach space supports disjoint hypercyclic operators which fail to be densely disjoint hypercyclic. In [13], the first and the last authors showed the existence of disjoint frequently hypercyclic operators T1, T2 such that T1  T1 and T2  T2 are not disjoint hypercyclic on X × X (that is, T1, T2 are not disjoint weakly

mixing) and therefore, T1, T2 do not satisfy the Disjoint Hypercyclicity Criterion. We finish the paper with the following open question.
Question 5.2. If T1, T2 are disjoint frequently hypercyclic operators, must they be densely disjoint hypercyclic?
