Abstract
We study the well-posedness of two systems modeling the non-equilibrium dynamics of pumped decaying Bose-Einstein condensates. In particular, we present the local theory for rough initial data using the Fourier restricted norm method introduced by Bourgain. We extend the result globally for initial data in L2.

1. Introduction

In this paper, we study the (local) well-posedness theory of two closely related models describing the (nonequilibrium) dynamics of pumped decaying condensates, e.g., the Bose-Einstein condensation of excitonpolaritons. The first model is the following driven-damped nonlinear Schrödinger equation [10]:

itu = -x2u + |u|2 u + i  -  |u|2 u,

(1)

where u = u (x, t), x  T, ,  are positive constants, and u0 = u (x, 0)  Hs (T), s  0. The second model consists of a generalized open-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the macroscopic
wave-function of the polaritons, u = u (x, t), coupled to a simple rate equation for the exciton reservoir density, n = n (x, t) [17, 18]:

itu = - x2u + g |u|2 u + nu + i (Rn - ) u,

(2)

tn =P - R |u|2 +  n,

subject to the initial data u|t=0 = u0 (x) , n|t=0 = n0 (x), x  R. Above, , , , g, R are positive constants and P = P (x)  0 (compactly supported, bounded).
In our analysis, we shall consider (1) on the one-dimensional torus. This choice is physically motivated by the fact that a stable condensate can only form in a spatially confined system. Such confinement gives rise to some technical challenges due to the loss of dispersion. Our approach is base on the Fourier restricted norm method introduced by Bourgain in [2, 3]. In the case of the system (2) the confinement is given by P . Our study of (2) requires some refinements of Bourgain's method, in particular, the ones introduced by Kenig-Ponce-Vega in [11, 12] and later used by Ginibre et. al. in [8] to study the well-posedness theory of the Zakharov system. On the other hand, it is important to notice that (2) does not have derivatives in the nonlinearities.
We shall refer to (1) as the complex Gross-Pitaevskii equation and to (2) as the exciton-polariton system.

2. Well-posedness of the complex Gross-Pitaevskii equation

Using Duhamel's principle, we consider the following integral equation associated with (1):

t

u (t) = S (t) u0 + S (t -  ) u - ( + i) |u|2 u ( ) d,

(3)

where S (t) = eitx2 . We introduce now the basic notation and ideas related to the restricted norm method;

see, e.g., [5, 7, 15] for a detailed review of this topic. Denote by lkqLp the Banach space lkq (Z : Lp (R)). Let ^· stand for the Fourier transform with respect to
space-time, i.e.,


g^ (k,  ) =

exp (-ikx - it ) g (x, t) dxdt.

- T

We denote by Fx the Fourier transform with respect to the space variable

Fxg (k) = exp (-ikx) g (x) dx.
T
Definition 1. Let W be the space of functions u : T × R  C, such that u (x, ·)  S (R) for each x  T and u (·, t)  C (T) for each t  R. We define the space Xs,b as the completion of W with respect to the norm

One can verify that the dual space of Xs,b is X-s,-b. Moreover, Xs,b  Xs,b for s  s, b  b. Since
we shall study the local theory using a contraction argument in a time interval [-, ] with   1, we define the (restricted) space Xs,b to be the equivalent classes of functions that agree on [-, ], with the norm

continuity (in time) of these solutions, as the following lemma shows (see [5, Lemma 3.9]):

From (11) we conclude that the local solution in L2x (T) can be extended globally. Note that to justify the calculations above we need to use continuous dependence on the data, approximate u0 by a sequence of
smooth functions, and take the limit. See, e.g., [4, 13] for a detailed description of this procedure.

which guarantees the existence of an absorbing set for the complex Gross-Pitaevskii equation in L2 (T). See, e.g., [16].
The H1 theory and stationary solutions of the complex Gross-Pitaevskii equation (in the full domain with a harmonic trapping potential and  space dependent with compact support) have been studied in [6, 9, 14].

3. Well-posedness of the exciton-polariton system

Using Duhamel's principle, we consider the following integral equations associated with (2):

t

u (t) = S (t) u0 + S (t - s) -ig |u|2 u + (R - i) nu - u (s) ds,

(12)

0

t

n (t) = n0 +

P - R |u|2 n - n (s) ds,

(13)

0

where S (t) = eitx2 . Our choice for the second expression is because the corresponding equation in (2) is an

ODE in n; hence, it does not have an appropriate dispersion relation for the subsequent analysis.

Definition 9. Let Xs,b be the Banach space of functions on R × R defined by the norm

u = Xs,(b)

 s  +  () b u^ (,  )

,

L2.

where  corresponds to the dispersion relation of the equation under consideration. · 2 = · . L2,
Similarly, we define the auxiliary spaces Y s by the norm

We usually write

u = Ys()

 s  +  () -1 u^ (,  )

.

L2 L1

We want to solve the Cauchy problem corresponding to (2) in the context of the previous spaces and
in some time interval [-T, T ]. To reach this goal, it is convenient to introduce a cutoff in (12)-(13). Let   C0 (R) be even, 0    1, such that  = 1 on [-1, 1] and supp   (-2, 2). Furthermore, let T (t) =  (t/T ), 0 < T  1. The cutoff version of (12)-(13) is given by

t

u (t) =  (t) S (t) u0 + T (t) S (t - s) -ig |u|2 u + (R - i) nu - u (s) ds,

(14)

0

t

n (t) =  (t) n0 + T (t) P - R |u|2 n - n (s) ds.

Like in the previous section, we define the restricted space u Xs,(b),T as the equivalent classes of functions that agree on t  [-T, T ], with the norm

u

Xs,(b),T

= inf
u~=u,t[-T,T ]

u~ . Xs,(b)

Similarly, we define the space u . Ys(),T The following lemma will be the starting point for our contraction argument (see [8, Lemma 2.1]).

Lemma 10. Let s  R, b  0  b  b + 1, and T  1. Then

As mentioned before, Xs,(b)  C (R, Hs), b > 1/2. This is no longer valid if b  1/2, and this is why we need to consider the spaces Ys() (see [8, Lemma 2.2]).
We now follow closely the ideas presented in [8]. As mentioned before, we want to solve the cutoff integral version of the exciton-polariton system (14)-(15) by a contraction method with u  Xk(,a)2=2 and n  Xl,(a)0 for suitable a, a2, and k, l. We start by estimating the nonlinearity

f1 = nu

in Xk(,-)a=12 for suitable a1. We estimate f^1 (1, 1) in terms of n^ (,  ) and u^ (2, 2). We have the following relations due to the
convolution structure
 = 1 - 2,

 = 1 - 2.

We also introduce the variables

1 = 1 + 12, 2 = 2 + 22,
 = .

In terms of these variables, we have

z  12 - 22 = 1 - 2 - .

(16)

We use this expression to obtain estimates of 12 (resp. 22) in terms of 22 (resp. 12) and of the 's. To estimate f1, we define v^2 = 2 k 2 a2 u^ and v^ =  l  a n^ so that

u = Xk(,a)2=2 5

v2 2 ,

and

n = v . Xl,(a)0

2

To estimate f1 in Xk(,-)a=12 , we take its scalar product with a generic function in X-(k,)a=12 with Fourier transform 1 k 1 -a1 v^1 and v1  L2. Then the required estimate in Xk(,-)a=12 takes the form

|S|  C v 2 v1 2 v2 2 ,

(17)

where

S=

(18)

and v^ = v^ (,  ) ,

v^1 = v^1 (1, 1) ,

v^2 = v^2 (2, 2) ,

constrained by

 = 1 - 2,  = 1 - 2,

and the integral is over d1, d2, d1, d2. We often use the following two elementary facts in our analysis.

Lemma 11. Let f  Lq (R), g  Lq (R) , 1  q, q  , 1/q + 1/q = 1. Assume that f and g are nonnegative, even, and non-increasing for positive argument. Then, f  g has the same properties.

One can use Lemma 11 to show that f  g takes its maximum at zero. Using this fact, we can show the following

Lemma 12. Let 0  a-  a+ and a+ + a- > 1/2, then the following estimate holds for all s  R

J (s) = y - s -2a+ y + s -2a- dy  C s - ,

where  = 2a- - [1 - 2a+]+. See [8] for a proof of the previous lemmata.

Lemma 13. Let k, l, a, a1, a2 satisfy

l  -1/2, k  0, k - l  1,

(19)

a, a1, a2 > 1/4, a + a1 > 3/4, a + a2 > 3/4,

(20)

k - l  2a1,

(21)

then the estimate (17) holds.

Proof. The principle of the proof is the following application of the Schwarz inequality. Let  = (,  ) , i = (i, i) , i = 1, 2 so that  = 1 - 2. We want to estimate an integral of the form

J = v^ () v^1 (1) v^2 (2) K (1, 2) d1d2.

and the last integral runs over 2 (or 1) for fixed . One obtains two similar estimates by circularly permuting the variables and functions 1, 2, and 1-2 (the ones with no subindex).
Moreover, we define  = 2 min (a1, a2) - [1 - 2 max (a1, a2)]+ ,

1 = 2 min (a, a2) - [1 - 2 max (a, a2)]+ ,

2 = 2 min (a, a1) - [1 - 2 max (a, a1)]+ .

We start by considering a particular case for k and l.

Case k = 0, l = -1/2. In this case, the factors containing the 's reduce to  1/2 . Note that

C2 = sup  -2a || 1 -2a1 2 -2a2 d2d2,

where the integral is taken at fixed , . Now for fixed , , and 2, it follows from (16) that

2 || d2 = dz = d1,

since z = 12 - 22 and  = 1 - 2  1 =  + 2, which gives dz = 2d2. Therefore,

C12 = sup 1 -2a1 ||  -2a 2 -2a2 d2d2,

where the integral is taken at fixed 1, 1. To continue the estimate, we split the 1 dominant region into two subregions.
Subregion |1|  2 |2| . Recall that  = 1 - 2, hence, || = |1 - 2|  |1| + |2|  3 |2|, the last inequality due to the subregion. Furthermore, for fixed 1, 1, and 2, it follows from (16) that 2 |2| d2 = dz = d. Therefore,

Region 2 dominant. This region is obtained from the previous one by exchanging 1 and 2. This has the effect of exchanging a2 and a1, so that the same proof applies since the only assumption used so far, namely (20), is symmetric in a2 and a1.

so that the factors with k's disappear and the resulting expression is decreasing in l. It is therefore sufficient to derive estimate (17) in the case l = -1/2, which is the special case considered previously.

provided k - l  2a1 and 1 > 1/2. The additional factor y -k in the integral does not provide any improvement since we need already 1 > 1/2 in the special case. The last integral again converges at infinity for all k  0 but does not yield any decay in 1. The condition k - l  2a1 corresponds to (21).
Region 2 dominant. We use the analog of (22) with fixed 2 and obtain

C22 = sup 2 -2a2 2 -2k

1 2k-2l  -2a 1 -2a1 d1d1.

For fixed 2, it follows from (16) that dz = 2 |1| d1. Using (30) and the fact that |z|  3 |2| for dominant 2 and integrating over 1 by the use of Lemma 12, we get

3|2 |

C22  C sup 2 -2a2 2 -2k

We assume without loss of generality that k  l. We estimate the last integral by separating the region 0  z  |2| /2 and |2| /2  z  3 |2| , which in the worst case 2 < 0 contribute respectively

2 1/2+k-l-2 ,

2 -1/2+k-l+[1-2]+ . Keeping the largest contribution, namely the second one, we obtain

C22  Csup 2 -2a2-1/2+k-l+[1-2]+ ,

and the last quantity is finite provided

k - l  2a2 + 1/2 - [1 - 2]+ .

(34)

We shall analyze that condition below together with a similar condition coming from the region  dominant. Region  dominant. We use (22) to get

C2 = sup  -2a  2k-2l

2 -2k 1 -2a1 2 -2a2 d2d2.

(35)

Now  dominant implies |z|  3 || and therefore 2  9 || by (33). We use this fact to estimate the first factor  -2a in (35). It follows again from (16) that dz = 2 || d2 for fixed . We furthermore express 2
in terms of z and  by (32), and we integrate over 2 for fixed z using Lemma 12. We obtain

32

C2 = Csup  2k-2l-4a ||-1

We next extend the range of integration of z symmetrically to -22  z - 2 = y  22 and apply Lemma

11 with f (y) = y/2 || -2k  |y|  22 , g (y) = y - to conclude that the supremum over  occurs for

C2 = Csup  2k-2l-4a ||-1

The right-hand side of the last expression is bounded for ||  1, i.e., we do not need the restriction ||  1. For ||  1 we consider separately the two integration subregions 0  y  || and ||  y  22. The

Comparing (36), (37), and (38), we see that C is finite provided

(37) (38)

k - l  2a + 1/2 - (1/2) [1 - ]+ ,

(39)

l > - (2a + ) + 1/2.

(40)

The last condition holds for any l  -1/2 provided 2a +  > 1, which is implied by

a + a1 > 1/2 a + a2 > 1/2, a + a1 + a2 > 1.

Note that the latter set of conditions has already been enforced. It only remains to ensure (34) and (39). Now we have already imposed the conditions k - l  2a1 and 1 > 1/2, 2 > 1/2 or equivalently

a, a1, a2 > 1/4, a + a1 > 3/4, a + a2 > 3/4.

(41)

The conditions (34) and (39) are implied respectively by

k - l <2a2 + 1/2,

(42)

k - l <2a2 + 2a - 1/2,

(43)

k - l <2a2 + 2a1 - 1/2,

(44)

k - l <2a2 + 2a + 2a1 - 3/2,

(45)

and

k - l <2a + 1/2,

(46)

k - l <2a + a1,

(47)

k - l <2a + a2,

(48)

k - l <2a + a1 + a2 - 1/2.

(49)

Now k - l  2a1 and (41) imply (44) and (45). Next, 2a + a1 > a + 1/4 + a1 = (1/2) (2a + 1/2 + 2a1) so that k - l  2a1 and (46) imply (47). Furthermore, 2a + a2 = (1/2) (2a2 + 2a - 1/2 + 2a + 1/2) so that (43) and (46) imply (48). Finally, 2a + a1 + a2 - 1/2 > a + a1 + a2 - 1/4 = (1/2) (2a1 + 2a2 + 2a - 1/2) so that k - l  2a1 and (43) imply (49). It is therefore sufficient to ensure (42), (43), and (46). By (41), the right-hand side of those three inequalities are all > 1; they are implied by k - l  1, contained in (19).

Now we have to verify the bounds for A in (23), that is

(50)

provided a, a1, a2 > 1/4 (see the first condition in (20)). We use the following result for the Schrödinger equation (see [8, Lemma 2.4])

12

Lemma 14. Let  () = 2 (Schrödinger equation). Assume b0 > 1/2 , 0  b  b0, and 0 <   1 (  1/2 if n = 1, i.e., 1D). Then

f  C f , Lqt (Lrx)

X0,(b)=2

where 2/q = 1 - b/b0,  (r)  n/2 - n/r = (1 - ) b/b0.

Using the previous lemma, we show the following

Lemma 15. Let a > 1/4, b0 = 2a > 1/2 . Consider n = 1. Let v  L2 and  =  + 2 (Schrödinger). Then

Lemma 16. Let a, a1, a2 > 1/4 and v, v1, v2  L2. Then (50) holds.
Proof. Since (50) is decreasing in a, a1, a2, it is sufficient to consider a = a1 = a2 > 1/4. We apply Hölder's inequality in space and time to obtain

Our next step is to estimate the nonlinearity f1 = nu in Yk()=2 . For this, we divide f^1 by 1 , integrate over 1 (or 1) for fixed 1 and then take the scalar product with a generic function in Hx-k with Fourier transform 1 k w^1, w1  L2x. The estimate of f1 in Yk()=2 becomes

S~  C v 2 w1 2 v2 2 ,

(52)

where

S~ =

a

|v^w^1v^2| 1 k 1 2 a2 2 k

with the same notation as in (18). Note that w1 is a function of space only, whereas the vs are functions of

space and time.

13

Lemma 17. Let a, a2, k, and l satisfy (19) and

a, a2 > 1/4, a + a2 > 3/4.

Then (52) holds.

Proof. The proof is similar to the one of Lemma 13. However, we have to handle w1 appropriately. For this, let a1 satisfy
0 < 1/2 - a1 < min (1/4, a - 1/4, a + a2 - 3/4) ,

so that

a1 > 1/4, a1 + a > 3/4, a1 + a2 > 3/4, a + a1 + a2 > 5/4.

Define v^1 = 1 a1-1 w^1. It follows that v1 2  C (1 - 2a1)-1/2 w1 2. Under these conditions, one can follow the proof of Lemma 13 with just minor modifications (cf. [8, Lemma 4.5]).

Now we consider the nonlinearity f2 = |u|2 u, which has been extensibly studied in the context of the NLS equation. We want to estimate f2 in Xk(,-)a=12 . Hence, we have to verify the expression

See [8, Lemma 4.7] for a sketch of the proof. See, e.g., [2, 12] for additional details.

Next we consider the nonlinearity f3 = |u|2 n. We want to estimate f3 in Xl,(-)a0 0, for suitable a0. Hence, we have to verify the expression

results.

Lemma 20. Let Then (57) and (59) hold.

k  0, l  k, a0 + a = 1/2, a2 > 1/2.

Proof. Note that, due to the constraint 1 + 2 = 3 + 4, we get 1 l  C 2 l + 3 l + 4 l . Then, considering the symmetry in the variables 2 and 3, we obtain

To bound B, we use Lemma 19 with l = 0. Hence, we require

0  -2k, a0 + a = 1/2, a2 > 1/2,

which implies k  0. For A, we use the condition l-k  0. Then, we consider Lemma 19 replacing k  k -l, since A is increasing in l and decreasing in k (recall k  0, k  l). Then, we need

-l  -2k, a0 + a = 1/2, a2 > 1/2.

Hence, combining all the previous conditions we obtain the result for (57). To estimate S~1, take v^1 = 1 a0-1 w^1 in (58). Since for a0 < 1/2, we have v^1 2  C (a0) w^1 2, (59)
holds.

We shall use the following simple observation.

Now we present the main result of this section

Proposition 22. The exciton-polariton system (2) with initial data (u0, n0)  Hk  Hl is locally well-posed

in Xk(,a)2=2,T  Xl,(a)0,T provided

k  0, l  k, k - l  2a1,

(71)

a = 1/4 + 3,

(72)

a1 = 1/2 - 2,

(73)

a2 = 1/2 + ,

(74)

with  > 0 small enough ( < 1/12). Moreover,

(u, n)  C [-T, T ] ; Hk  Hl ,

with T = T ( u0 Hk , n0 Hl ) > 0.

Proof. Set

a0 = 1/4 - 3.

(75)

Then, one can verify that under conditions (71)-(75) all the assumptions of Lemmas 13, 17, 18, 20, 21 are satisfied. Moreover, we have a + a0 < 1 and a2 + a1 < 1, hence, we can apply Lemma 10 and obtain therefrom a strictly positive power of T . Then, we get the result considering the cutoff system (14)-(15) and using a standard fixed point argument. Notice that we use the spaces restricted in time to deal with the term P = P (x), not to get a positive power of T , which we get from Lemma 10. For a  1/2 we have to take into account [8, Lemma 2.2] to conclude continuity in time of the solution.

Corollary 23. Let (u0, n0)  L2  L2 with n0 (x)  0. Then, there exists a global in time solution (u, n)  C [0, ) , L2  L2 of the exciton-polariton system (2). Furthermore, the system has an absorbing set in L2  L2.

Proof. Consider a smooth solution of (2), then argue by density. Using the usual variation of constants formula in the second equation of (2), we have

where  (t, x) = R |u (t, x)|2 + . Hence, if n0 (x)  0, then n (t, x)  0 for all t  [0, T ] since P = P (x)  0. Now multiply the first equation in (2) by u¯, integrate over R, and take the imaginary part to get

|u|2 dx =

Furthermore, integrate the second equation in (2) over R to obtain
