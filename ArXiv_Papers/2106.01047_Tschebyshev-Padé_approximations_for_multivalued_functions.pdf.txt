TSCHEBYSHEV­PADE´ APPROXIMATIONS FOR MULTIVALUED FUNCTIONS
EVGUENII A. RAKHMANOV AND SERGEY P. SUETIN

Abstract. We discuss the relation between the linear Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximations to analytic function f and the diagonal type I Hermite­Pad´e polynomials for the tuple of functions [1, f1, f2] where the pair of functions f1, f2 forms certain Nikishin system. An approach is proposed of how to extend the seminal Stahl's Theory for Pad´e approximations for multivalued analytic functions to the Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximations. The approach is based on the relation between Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximations and Hermite­Pad´e polynomials and also on a connection of Hermite­ Pad´e polynomials and multipoint Pad´e approximants.

1. Tschebyshev­Pade´ Approximations
Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximations are rational (with free poles) approximations to orthogonal expansions. Theory of free poles rational approximations is a classical fields on the boundary of approximation theory and complex analysis. At the same time it is one of the hot topics in contemporary mathematics due to many new applications and connections with the other problems from various branches of classical analysis. In particular, convergence problems for Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximation for function with branch points have many important connections and some of them are discussed in this paper.
On the other hand, constructions of free poles rational approximations are known to be numerically effective and widely used in applications (see [4], [5], [46], [3]). In the end of the paper we present results of some numerical experiments illustrating our theoretical exposition.

1.1. Definitions. Let µ be a positive measure on the interval  := [-1, 1] and Tn(x; µ) = n(µ)xn + · · · be the associated sequence of orthonormal polynomials

(1)

Tk(x; µ)Tn(x; µ) dµ(x) = kn, k, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,



where kn is the Kronecker symbol and n(µ) > 0. Any function f  L2(µ) may be represented by a series with respect to the system
{Tk(x; µ)} k=0:



(2)

f (z) = ckTk(z; µ), ck = ck(f ) = f (x)Tk(x; µ) dµ(x).

k=0



which converges to f (z) in L2(µ). If f is holomorphic on  and µ (x) := dµ(x)/dx > 0

a.e. on  then series (2) converges inside (on the compact subsets) of the maximal

ellipse with foci ±1 where f is holomorphic (see [45]). The series diverges outside of

this ellipse. A classical approach to the problem of the analytic continuation of f to

larger domains is based on rational approximation to expansions (2) with free poles. A

typical "Pad´e - like" construction (first explicitly introduced in [12], see also [9], [13])

is the following.

Let Pn be the set of all algebraic polynomials with complex coefficients of degree n. The (linear) Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximant to f of order n is the ratio of two

polynomials n(z) = Pn/Qn from Pn defined by



(3)

(Qnf - Pn)(z) =

an,kTk(z; µ).

k=2n+1

The rational function n(z) is called the n th diagonal Frobenious­Pad´e (or linear Tschebyshev­Pad´e) approximant to the series (2). Since an,k = ck(Qnf - Pn) and Pn  Pn, the relations (3) are equivalent to

(4)

ck(Qnf ) = 0, k = n + 1, . . . , 2n.

In turn, equations (4) may be written as a system of n linear homogeneous equations

for n+1 unknowns coefficients of the polynomial Qn  Pn. Such system has a nontrivial solution so that approximations n = Pn/Qn always exists. They may not be unique unlike to Pad´e approximants to a power series. For uniqueness problem see [20] and

Remark 2 below.

It is easy to see that to find the polynomial Qn from the system (4) we need 3n + 1 coefficients ck(f ), k = 0, 1, . . . , 3n, of the series (2) should be given.
If denominator Qn is known, then corresponding numerator Pn is determine by

n

(5)

Pn(z) = ck(Qnf )Tk(z; µ).

k=0

Remark 1. There is another version of definition called Baker definition [4] (see first

of all [19] and also [15], [16], [17]). According to this definition the rational function

Fn of order n is defined by



(6)

(f - Fn)(x) =

bn,kTk(x; µ).

k=2n+1 2

Here only 2n + 1 coefficients c0, . . . , c2n of the power series (2) are needed to construct Fn. Such rational function Fn does not always exist; see [38] and [39]. If Fn exists it is called also the diagonal nonlinear Pad´e approximation to the polynomial series (2). In general Fn = n. In this paper we mainly consider linear approximations n.

1.2. Convergence problems and plan of the paper. First convergence result for Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximations were obtained in the papers [15] and [16] where for the Markov type function f (z) = (z), where

d d(t)

(7)

(z) =

,

c z-t

z / [c, d],

S = [c, d]  R \ .

Both constructions n and Fn has been studied for such functions f . It was proven that the rational functions n are always unique while functions Fn always exist. Convergence of both sequences {n(z)} and {Fn(z)} to f (z) inside the domain C \ [c, d] was proven and the comparison of the corresponding rates of convergence was given. It seems that similar results are not known for any other general classes of functions
In the current paper we consider convergence problems for linear Tschebyshev­Pad´e (Tschebyshev­Pad´e­Frobenious) approximations n to the orthogonal series (2) for functions with finite number of branch points; class of such functions we will denote by A.
In case of classical diagonal Pad´e approximants at infinity a basic convergence theorem for the class f =  has been proved by A. Markov in 1884 and untill 1985 this theorem had been essentially the only general result in the field (together with associated Stieltjes theorem for the case when supp  is not a compact set). A century later, in 1985 a convergence theorem for the class A has been proved by H. Stahl (see [35] and the references therein) and it was arguably one of the most significant event in the theory in 20-th century. In case of Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximants the analogue of the Markov theorem is valid. The convergence problem for class A is open and its solution does not seem to be close. We will try to outline an approach based on a certain far reaching generalization of an original Stahl's method.
Method originated by Stahl has been further developed in [14]. The generalized version (which we call GRS-method) has a larger circle of applications; solutions of a number of problems has been obtained in [14] and subsequent papers [6], [7], [?], [31], [R-h-Pade]. These results strongly suggest that the method has a potential to be further generalized but any such generalization will require significant efforts. In particular, the GRS-method is not yet developed far enough for applications to Hermite­Pad´e approximations.
It turns out that convergence problems for Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximants may be reduced to zero distribution problems for the first kind Hermite­Pad´e approximants for a system of three functions constituting a Nikishin system. Moreover, it seems to be the only visible general approach to the problem. It follows from the remarks above that this approach is rather problematic itself. There are no known results which can be used and we have to begin with a study of certain basic problems for Hermite­Pad´e approximants.
In turn, a natural approach to zero distribution problem for the Hermite­Pad´e approximants may be based on a general interpolation problem which presents also an independent interest. In the next sections we will discuss a situation briefly outlined
3

above in some details. We will begin with a brief review of original Markov and Stahl results.

2. Pade´ approximants at infinity

Given a function analytic at infinity or formal series in powers of 1/z

(8)

f (z) =  cn

zn

n=0

we can find for any n  N polynomials Pn, Qn  Pn such that

1

(9)

Qnf - Pn (z) = O zn+1 , z  ,

and Qn is not identical zero. The ratio Pn/Qn for any pair of such polynomials is unique and is called the n-th (diagonal) Pad´e approximants to the series f .
There are two specially important classes of functions for which there is a general convergence theorem. The first one is an old simple classical result which was originally stated in terms of continued fractions.

Markov theorem (1884) . Let f (z) = (z) where  is a positive measure on the real line with a compact support. Then sequence of Pad´e approximants (PA) Pn/Qn converges to f uniformly on compact sets in C \ S where S is the minimal segment of R containing S.

If S = S consists of a finite number of intervals  (x) > 0 almost everywhere (a.e.) on S then the exact rate of convergence may be also indicated. Both convergence and

its rate may be obtained from zero distribution for denominators Qn

(10)

n (Qn)  , n  ,

where  is the Robin measure of S.

The proof is easily obtained from the fact the Pad´e denominators Qn are orthogonal polynomials with respect to 

(11)

xkQn(x)d(x) = 0, k = 0, 1, . . . , n - 1.

In particular, zeros of such polynomials (poles of approximations) all belong the minimal segment of R containing S.

2.1. Stahl's convergence theorems. Stahl's convergence theorem for PA (9) at infinity is related to multivalued functions with a small set of branch points. To state the theorem we have to introduce few important definitions.
Let D be a domain in the extended plane C. We denote by H(D) space of holomorphic (singlevalued) functions in D. We further denote by A(D) class of multivalued analytic functions in D; more exactly, we write f  A(D) if f is determined by an elements at some point z0  D (or in a subdomain of D) which allow for analytic continuation along any path in D which begins at z0.
Let e  C be a finite set and function f defined by a series (8) at  belongs to A(C \ e). We denote by F the set of cuts F which make f singlevalued, that is

(12)

F = Ff = {F  C : f  H(C \ F )}

4

(we also assume that F  F satisfy certain additional assumptions which may vary depending on a current situation; for a moment this is not important).

Definition 1. Finally, we say that   F satisfies S-property if the following conditions

are satisfied

(a)  is a finite union of analytic arcs and may be a compact set of zero capacity, (b) in the interior points   0 of these arcs we have the following symmetry

condition

(13)

U

U

() = (),

  0,

n1

n2

where U  is the potential of the equilibrium (Robin) measure  of  and n1,2 are oppositely oriented normal vectors to  at ,

(c) jump (f + - f -)() of f across  is not identical zero on any analytic arc in .

We call a compact set with these properties an S-compact set.

With these definitions we have the following

Stahl's theorem (1986). Let f  A(C \ e) where e is (here) a finite set. Then (i) there exists a unique S-compact set   Ff , (ii) sequence Pn/Qn of Pad´e approximants for f converges to f in capacity on com-
pact sets in C \ .
Proof of the theorem is essentially more complicated than the proof of Markov theorem. In the part (i) related to existence of S-compact the method is rather traditional. It was known (see [29]) that S-compact set  minimizes capacity in class F. Minimal capacity problem was known in geometric function theory and its version related to the situation has been solved by Stahl in frames of this theory.
The essential difference between the two cases is in the orthogonality conditions for denominators Qn. For x  R we have x = x and therefore orthogonality relations (11) present orthogonality in a Hilbert space. Pad´e denominators Qn in Stahl theorem satisfy nonhermitian orthogonality relations

(14)

zkQn(z)f (z) dz = 0, k = 0, 1, . . . , n - 1,



which surprisingly share certain properties of hermitian orthogonal polynomials but it

is rather difficult to prove.

2.2. Generalizations. A study of Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximants may be based on an analogue of Stahl's theorem for type I Hermite­Pad´e polynomials for two multivalued functions. This includes two problems.
The first on is related to the construction of the proper generalization of the notion of S-compact set. The idea of how to solve this problem was proposed in the papers [43], [40], [41], [44], [21]. The new approach to the existence problem developed in these papers is based on consideration of an equilibrium problem on a double-sheeted Riemann surface. Characterization of the S-compact set associated with the problem may be given by different terms; we go into some details below.
A more challenging problem is that nonhermitian type orthogonality conditions (14) in case of Hermite­Pad´e approximants will turn into a combination of two systems of orthogonality relations. How to work with such combination is known in some cases
5

but the case under consideration is new and require a new method. We go into some details next.

3. Hermite­Pade´ polynomials.

Let functions f1, f2 determined by series at infinity

(15)

fj(z) =



cn,j , zn

n=0

j = 1, 2

Corresponding type I Hermite­Pad´e polynomials Qn,0  Pn-1 and Qn,1, Qn,2  Pn are defined by the following relation

(16)

1 Rn(z) = Qn,0 + Qn,1f1 + Qn,2f2 (z) = O z2n+2 , z  

(called also HP-polynomials for the tuple of three functions [1, f1, f2] and multiindex n = (n - 1, n, n); Rn is associated remainder). Such polynomials Qn,j exist but may not unique (this will not be essential here; see [28, Chapter 4] and [37]).
But for the functions given by representations (17) the tuple [Qn,0, Qn,1, Qn,2] is uniquely determined up to a nontrivial constant multiplier.

3.1. Case of two Markov functions. Let the measures µ and  are two positive measure, Sµ =  = [-1, 1] and S = [c, d]  R \ . We define

dµ(x)

(x) dµ(x)

(17)

f1(z) = µ(z) :=

,  z-x

f2(z) = µ,  (z) :=


, z  D, z-x

where D := C \  and (z) is given by (7). Corresponding type I Hermite­Pad´e polynomials Qn,0  Pn-1 and Qn,1, Qn,2  Pn
are uniquely determined by (7) up to a nontrivial constant multiplier. In this case we have explicit formula for the n-th order Tschebyshev­Pad´e approx-
imant n = Pn/Qn for f (z) =  (see (3) in terms of Hermite­Pad´e polynomials Qn,j for (f1.f2) in (16)

Proposition 1. We have

(18)

n(z)

=

Pn(z) Qn(z)

=

- Qn,1(z) Qn,2(z)

Proof. It follows directly from definitions that

(19)

Rn(t)q(t) dt = 0 for each q  P2n,



where  is a closed curve that separates the set  from infinity. Since the term with

Qn,0 in Rn vanishes and taking also into account representations (17) we obtain

(20)

(Qn,1 + Qn,2)(x)q(x) dµ(x) = 0,



where q  P2n is an arbitrary polynomial. From here, since f =  we have



(21)

(Qn,1 + Qn,2f )(z) =

cn,kTk(z; µ).

k=2n+1 6

By uniqueness property of Tschebyshev­Pad´e(­Frobenious) approximation [15] n to f (z) = (z), we have that n = -Qn,1/Qn,2 and Proposition 1 follows.
Remark 2. From Proposition 1 it follows that the diagonal Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximations can be found from the Laurent expansions at the infinity point z =  of the functions f1(z) and f2(z) given by (17). Clearly the coefficients of those Laurent expansions can be found directly from the coefficients ck of the series (2) and vice versa. Thus for computing of the rational function n = -Qn,1/Qn,2 it is possible to use the algorithms for computing the type I Hermite­Pad´e polynomials for the tuple [1, f1, f2] and multiindex n = (n - 1, n, n); see [22], [23] and the bibliography therein.
Note that both Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximations and Hermite­Pad´e polynomials are constructive in the sense of P. Henrici paper [18, Sec. 2] and are based on just the same initial data (see also [47]).

It follows from (20) that for f =  the combination (21)

(22)

Qn,1 + Qn,2f = Qnf - Pn,

which is related to Hermite­Pad´e polynomials Qn,1, Qn,2 for the pair f1, /f2 in (17) and simultaneously to Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximants n = Pn/Qn has 2n - 1 zeros on the interval . Let us denote the monic polynomial with these zeros by n.
Zero distribution of polynomials n and Qn = Qn,2 are defined by the following vector equilibrium problem. Let M(, 1) be the set of positive vector measures µ = (µ0, µ1) where µ0 is a positive measure on  with total mass µ0() = 2 and µ1 is a positive measure on F = [c, d] with total mass µ1(F ) = 1. The energy E of the vector-measure (µ0, µ1) is defined by

(23)

E(µ0, µ1) = U µ0(x) dµ0(x) - U µ0(t) dµ1(t) + U µ1(t) µ1(t),

where U µ(z) = - log |z - x|dµ(x) is the logarithmic potential of µ. Equivalently,

this energy is defined by positive definite 2 × 2-matrix M =

1 -1/2

-1/2 1

.

There is a unique pair of measures (0, 1)  M(, F ) which minimizes vectorenergy

(24) where M = M(F0, F1)

E(0, 1) = min E(µ0, µ1) M

Proposition 2. Under the same assumptions (17) as in Proposition 1 we have as n

1

1

1

n (Qn,1),  1 n (Qn,2)  1

and

n (n)  0,

For a proof and further details see [15], [16]). Convergence n(z)  f (z) together with the rate follows from Proposition 2.

3.2. General case. In case when

(25)

fj(z) =



cn,j zn

 A(C \ ej)

n=0

j = 1, 2

with arbitrary finite sets e1, e2 we do not have even a reliable conjecture on the zero distribution of Hermite­Pad´e polynomials (16). There is a few isolated results in [29], [1], [2], [32], [26] where some details and remarks may be found (see also [24]).
The convergence problem for Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximants which is our main concern is related to the so-called Nikishin case when functions f1, f2 have common branch point ±1 such that ratio

(26)

f (x)

=

f2+(x) f1+(x)

- -

f2-(x) f1-(x)

,

x  (-1, 1),

of the jumps of functions f1 and f2 across  is extended as analytic function in class A(C \ e) with a finite set e  C \ . Observe that for functions f1(z) and f2(z) in (17) and f (z) = (z) we have exactly this relation. In the sequel we restrict ourselves to this case.
A representative example of such functions is given by

m

1 j

(27)

f (z) :=

Aj - (z) ,

j=1

m
where |Aj| > 1, j = 0 and  = (z) := z + (z2 - 1)1/2 be the inverse to Zhukovskii
j=0
function z = ( + 1/)/2.
In particular, for m = 2 the Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximation n to such function admits the following representation in terms of type I Hermite­Pad´e polynomials

n(z)

=

Qn,1(z) Qn,2(z)

+

1 .
A1A2

This class of function has been introduced in [42] where the further details may be found.
For functions f of the form (27) (and for more general class which we describe later) we will formulate a general conjecture on convergence of Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximants. We will suggest also a method of proof based on a study of multipoint Pade approximants to functions of class A. This is a general free poles interpolation problem which also present an independent interest.

4. General interpolation problem

Let e  C be a finite set and f  A(C \ e). We denote by

(28)

F = Ff = {F  C : f  H(C \ F )}

the set of cuts F  F which make f singlevalued. We also assume (here) that F  F is a finite union of smooth (analytic) arcs (additional assumptions on compacts F  F may vary; see [32]);

8

Let Pn denote the set of all polynomials of degree at most n and n  P2n. For any function f holomorphic in an open set containing the set Zn of zeros of n there exist a pair of polynomials Pn  Pn-1 and Qn  Pn such that

(29)

(Qnf - Pn)(z) n(z)



H (Zn )

and Qn is not an identical zero. Conditions (29) are called linear interpolation conditions; they imply that Rn = Qnf - Pn vanishes at zeros of n (together with a number of derivatives in case of multiple zeros). These conditions are reduced to a linear system
of 2n homogeneous equations with 2n + 1 unknown coefficients of Pn, Qn which has a nontrivial solution.
Rational function Pn/Qn generally interpolate f at zeros of  but, may be, not at all zeros. It is possible that n() = 0 for some   Zn and at the same time Pn() = Qn() = 0 so that (Pn/Qn)() = f (). In such case we will say that interpolation condition at  is lost. Clearly that if kn is the number of lost interpolation then in fact deg Pn n - 1 - kn and deg Qn n - kn in the representation n = Pn/Qn.
Assume that the sequence {n}nN (interpolation table) has a weak- limit distribution

(30)

n (n) = n

()  2

()=0

where  is a unit positive measure. We will consider convergence problem for the sequence of interpolating functions Pn/Qn, i.e. multipoint Pad´e approximants associated with an interpolation table {n} and also closely related problem of zero distribution of denominators Qn.

Remark 3. In case when some or all zeros of n are located at infinity interpolation
conditions (29) has to be modified. In particular, if Zn = {} (with multiplicity 2n) interpolation conditions (29) are written as (Qnf - Pn)(z) = O(1/zn+1) (assuming
f () = 0) so that Pn/Qn are classical Pad´e approximants at 

Convergence problem for the sequence Pn/Qn is one of the central problems in the classical approximation theory and there is a large number of results in this direction. In the connection with convergence of Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximants we need to consider the interpolation problem under more general assumptions on the limiting density of the interpolation table than in all the known results. In such generality the problem is open and in this connection we will present a conjecture. As an introduction to this conjecture we consider the case of interpolation in a finite number of points. This case is not in not an immediate cotollary of known results too but it may be essentially investigated in frames of GRS method.

4.1. Orthogonality conditions for denominators Qn. The convergence problem for multipoint Pad´e approximants Pn/Qn is essentially reduced to a study of zero distribution of Pad´e denominators Qn. These polynomilas may also be viewed as nonhermitian orthogonal polynomials with certain variable weights. The following proposition is well known starting point of GRS method.

where means integration over the boundary of the domain C\F which moves around
F
nonintegrable singularities of f along arcs of small circles in C \ F apart from points in Zn.
Proof. We have Rn(z) = (Qnf - Pn)(z)/n(z)  H(C \ F ) and this function has zero of order n + 1 at infinity. Therefore zkRn(z)  H(C \ F ) and has zero of order 2 at infinity if k n - 1. Now (31) follows by the Cauchy integral theorem since them relate to integration of Pn/n vanishes.

5. GRS theorem

Under certain assumption on the limit density  the zero distribution of the denominators Qn defined in (31) may be obtained directly from GRS-theorem which we formulate below as Theorem 1. Conditions of this theorem are more general in the part related to a variable (depending on n) weights: the weight 1/n in orthogonality conditions (31) is replaced by an abstract analytic weight function n(z) satisfying, however, a uniform convergence condition

(32)

n log |n(z)|  (z), z  ,

where (z) is harmonic in a domain containing   F which satisfies S-property in
the external field , i.e. (here)  is a finite union of analytic arcs and in the interior points   0 of this arcs we have the symmetry condition

 U  +  () =  U  +  ()

(U  is the potential of the equilibrium measure  in the external field  on  and

n1,2 are oppositely oriented normal vectors to  at ). It is also important that jump (f + - f -)() of f across  is not identical zero on any analytic arc in . Under these

conditions the following theorem is valid; see [14].

Theorem 1. If polynomials Qn  Pn are defined by orthogonality relations

5.1. Existence of S-compact set. The main challenge in applications of the theorem is the existence of an S-compact set   Ff related to a situation. In most cases such a compact exists and unique but there are exceptions and it is often not easy to establish fact of existence. In some cases existence may be proved by max-min energy problem (see [34], [30], [25], [36], [31], [32], [27]) which we discuss later in connection with our current problem (31). Anyway, situation is essentially simplified if existence of an S-compact set is known.
10

An immediate corollary of Theorem 1 for multipoint Pad´e approximants to a function

f  A(C\e) (see (28)) under assumption (30) is the following. If there is a compact set   Ff with S-property in the external field  = -U  which is homotopic to F = Ff

in C \ (e  Zn) then orthogonality relations (31) may be written with  in place of F .

Convergence Pn/Qn  f (in capacity) on compact sets in complement to  normally follows.

Situation when there is no S-compact set (compact set  with S-property) in class

Ff is more complicated. GRS-theorem may not directly applied and we have to go into all the details of the situation. In particular it is important to figure out geo-

metric properties of the S-configuration which will allow to apply GRS-theorem or its

modification.

5.2. Max-min energy method in frames of general interpolation. In the connection to multipoint Pad´e approximants (29) we can make an immediate progress for the case when the support of the limit density  is a finite set (see [6], [7], [8])

Recall that we interpolate branch f  H(C \ F ) of a function f  A(C \ e) determined by a cut F  Ff . Orthogonality conditions (31) allow for continuous deformation of F in the domain of analyticity of f /n which means, in particular, that class Ff is not adequate to the situation; to preserve conditions (31) we need homotopy in the domain of analyticity of f /n.
If there is no S-compact set homotopic to F in the domain of analyticity of f /n
we have to consider a larger class F integration contours such that orthogonality conditions (31) is preserved. Together with continuous deformation of F in the domain of analyticity of f /n we have to consider deformations which produce homologous (but not homotopic) contour of integration (a curve jumps over a point   supp ). The
class of curves F which we which is obtained this way depends on both f  A(C \ e) and sequence n.

Proposition 4. There exist   F with S-property in the external field  = -U .

The max-min proof of the proposition is based on the functional of equilibrium energy. Let E(µ) be the energy of the measure µ in the external field  = -U . For
F  F we denote by F the associated unit equilibrium measure on F which is defined by the condition that E(µ) takes its minimal value in class of unit positive measures µ on F only for µ = F .
Next we maximize equilibrium energy E(F ) over F  F . If the maximizing com-

exists then we use local variations to prove that it has the S property in the external field  = -U  (cf. [30], [25], [32]).

As a corollary we obtain a theorem on zero distribution of polynomilas Qn (we do not go into further duscussions of details related this theorem).

Theorem 2. Suppose that we interpolate f  A(C \ e) using a table n with limiting density  (see (30)) and measure  has a finite support (35) (assume also that zeros

of polynomials n belong to the support of ). Let  b the unit equilibrium measure on   F in the external field (z) = -U (z)

and  is from Proposition 4.

Then

the

to

n  .

Remark 4. Condition that zeros of polynomials n belong to the support of  is not essential. There is only o(n) zeros of n outside of arbitrarily small neighbourhood of   supp . Any single zero  of n is an obstacle for deformation of F "through"  if we want to preserve orthogonality conditions (31). However, such a deformation is possible if we eliminate interpolating conditions (29) by setting Pn() = Qn() = 0. It seems that this a common way of elimination of a small number of the "wrong" interpolation conditions (interpolation of a "wrong" branch). Loss of o(n) of interpolation conditions does not influence zero distributions.

5.3. Quadratic differential. Set  may be described in terms of trajectories of qua-
dratic differentials in a way similar to what we have in case of classical Pad´e approxi-
mants. This description is obtained as an intermediate result in application of max-min method. Let e = {a1, a2, . . . , am} and A(z) = mj=1(z - aj) and the limit measure  for interpolation table. Then there exist a polynomial V (z) = zm+2p-3 such that  is
a union of some of (critical) trajectories of the quadratic differential

There are p equations involving residues of the function V /A/B at points z = k on parameters (roots or coefficients) of V . Using this equations we can study in details case A(x) = z2 - 1, B(z) = z2 + 1 - with different values of m1 and m2.

5.4. Conjecture 1. Theorem 2 above is a direct corollary of known results on maxmin energy and GRS-method. Under more general assumptions on  the method may be applied after some modifications. Some of these modifications are not immediate and at this moment we do not have formal proof of the theorem generalizing Theorem 2 and we will state a conjecture for a general case.
Moreover, it is not yet obvious that the conjecture below is, indeed, valid without more restrictions on .

Conjecture 1. Assume that F  Ff and interpolation table {n} do not intersect F.

Assume further that limit density  in (30) exists and supp  do not intersect e. Then

there

exist

The max-min compact set  has S-property but the definition of this property has to be slightly modified.

6. Conjecture on Tschebyshev­Pade´ approximants 
Let R be the Riemann surface of the function z2 - 1 defined as a double-sheeted (branched) covering of C with quadratic branch points ±1. Let  : R  C be associated canonic projection. Lifting R \ -1() of the domain C \  = [-1, 1] onto R is union of two disjoint domains D0 and D1 both projected by  one-to-one onto C \ .
Let e = {a1, a2, . . . , am} be distinct point in C \ . Together with points aj  e we will have to consider their images aj = -1(aj)  D1. Thus, set e = {a1, a2, . . . , am} belongs to the first sheet D1  R.
Let function f on R be holomorphic in D0 and has analytic continuation from D0 along any path on R which does not hit any point from e (at least two points from e
are branch points for f . This function has a continuous extension to the boundary of D0 which is the union
of two copies of the interval  whose endpoints are identified. We select arbitrarily any of these intervals and denote f (z) = f (-1(z)). Function f (z) is continuous on  an holomorphic on (-1, 1).
Analytic continuation of f from (-1, 1) to the upper half-plane may be extended to
a function f  H(C \ ). Lifting of this extension is one of two function either f |D0 or
f |D1. We will agree that continuation of f to upper half plane leads to the projection
f0 of the function f |D0 (this makes the choice of the branch of f unique). Now, analytic continuation of f to the lower half-plane may extended to a function f1(z) holomorphic in the complement to e  .
We will consider Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximation to the function f (z) with an analytic weight w(x) on . The approximant of order n is the ratio of two polynomials Pn/Qn of degree at most n which are defined by

(38)

xk


(Qnf

-

Pn)(x)

w(x)dx 
1 - x2

=

0,

k = 0, 1, . . . , 2n - 1.

Integration over  in this definition may be replaced with integration over a smooth curve F0 connecting points -1 and 1 in a domain of analyticity of w which is homotopic to  in C \ e (we assume that w may be extended far enough; exact conditions will be formulated below). Set of such curves will be denoted by F0
Next, we have f1  A(C \ (e  )). Let F1 be the set of admissible cuts for f1, that is, for any F1  F1 we have f1  H(C \ F1). We assume also that F1  F1 is a finite union of smooth arcs.
We will consider only pairs F = {(F0, F1)} of disjoint compacts Fk  Fk (k = 0, 1). The description of behaviour of approximants Pn/Qn defined by (38) is given in terms
of a vector S-compact set (0, 1)  F which may be defined as follows. Let M(F0, F1) be the set of positive vector measures µ = (µ0, µ1) on (F0, F1) respec-
tively with masses µ0(F0) = 2 and µ0(F1) = 1. The energy E of the vector-measure (µ0, µ1) is defined by

(39)

E (µ0, µ1) = U µ0dµ0 - U µ0dµ1 + U µ1dµ1.

Equivalently, this energy is defined by 2×2 positive definite matrix M =

1 -1/2

-1/2 1

13

For any (F0, F1) there is a pair of measures (0, 1)  M(F0, F1) on F0 and F1 respectively which solve the matrix equilibrium problem with masses 0(F0) = 2 and 0(F1) = 1 and vector equilibrium measure (0, 1) minimizes vector-energy

(40)

E(0, 1) = min E(µ0, µ1),

M

where M = M(F0, F1).

Proposition 5. There is a pair of compact sets 0  F0 and 1  F1 which maximizes equilibrium energy E(0, 1).

Denote (0 , 1 ) components of the equilibrium measure,  = (0, 1). The idea of the proof of the Proposition 5 was proposed in [44]; it is based on the equivalent reformulation of the equilibrium problem (39)­(40) in terms of weighted potential on the Riemann surface R (see [10], [11]). Descriptions of the equilibrium vector-compact (0, 1) may be given using different terms.

Conjecture 2. Let Pn/Qn be n-th order Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximant to the func-

tion f0(z).

Then we have, first,

1 n

(Qn)



1

as

n



.

Second, function Rn =

Qnf - Pn has 2n(1 + o(1)) zeros around 0 and the normalized counting measure n

of these zeros weakly converges to 0 .

A proof of the conjecture may be based on Conjecture 1. We outline a plan of such

proof assuming that Conjecture 1 is proved in complete generality.

We may need Conjecture 1 in maximal generality since we do not have an a'priory

information on location of zeros of the function Rn = Qnf - Pn but we know, at least, that we have to consider branch f = f1 of this function in D1 = C \ 1. Assume that this function has 2n(1 + o(1)) zeros in D1. We denote by n polynomial with zeros at these points which belong to D1. At this moment we will ignore zeros of Rn on 1.
If there are too many of them on 1 we may have to pass to a slightly different branch of f but now we do not go into such details.

Then we select a weakly convergent subsequences: we find a subsequence   N

such

that

as n  ,

n  ,

(30) is

valid

and

at

the

same

time

1 n



(Qn)



.

Now we

have to prove that (, ) = (0 , 1 ).

We consider interpolation problem for the branch of f1 in C \ 1 and derive from

Conjecture 1 that  is the equilibrium measure on 1 in the external field -U .

It follows also that after a proper normalization we have convergence in capacity

(41)

U (z).

Then orthogonality conditions (38) imply that  is the equilibrium measure on 0 in the external field -1/2U . This would conclude the proof.

7. One numerical example
In this Section we discuss a numerical example on the distribution of the zeros of Hermite­Pad´e polynomials and poles and zeros of Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximations. All the numerical computations were performed using the Program HePa.com [23]. This Program is based on a generalization of the classical Viskovatov algorithm [22].
14

In this section we denote Pad´e polynomials of degree n by Pn,0 and Pn,1, i.e., for a given f  H()
1 (Pn,0 + Pn,1f)(z) = O zn+1 , z  .

Denominator and numerator of Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximation n(z) of order n for a series h of type (2) is denoted here by Qn and Pn respectively, i.e. n(z) = Pn(z)/Qn(z) and


(Qnh - Pn)(z) =

cn,kTk(z; µ).

k=2n+1

As before, type I Hermite­Pad´e polynomials for multiindex (n, n, n) and for a tuple of

functions [1, f1, f2], f1, f2  H(), is denoted by Qn,0, Qn,1 and Qn,2, i.e.

1 (Qn.0 + Qn,1f1 + Qn,2f2)(z) = O z2n+2 , z  .

Let function f be from the class given by the explicit representation (27). Here we

set m = 3, 1 = 2 = -1/3, 3 = 2/3 and A3  (1, 2), A1,2 = e ± ib, where e > 0 is a small real number. Thus

1 -1/3

1 -1/3

1 2/3

(42)

f (z) = A1 - (z)

A2 - (z)

A3 - (z)

(here (z) = z + (z2 - 1)1/2  2z as z  ). Let function f be given by (42). Let consider two tuples [1, f, f 2] and [1, 1/(z2 -1)1/2, f ]. Clearly that the pair (-Qn,1, Qn,2) from the second tuple gives a Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximation to the function h, i.e. n(z) = -Qn,1(z)/Qn,2(z). Thus zeros of Qn,1 and Qn,2 are respectively zeros and poles of the Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximation n.
Let now take into account all that was said before about the connection between type I Hermite­Pad´e polynomials and Tschebyshev­Pad´e approximations and about max-min problem which was conjectured to describe the limit zeros distribution of Hermite­Pad´e polynomials. Then based on that information we might suppose that the limit zero distribution of the corresponding HP-polynomials for both tuples [1, f, f 2] and [1, 1/(z2 - 1)1/2, f ], where f is from (42), should be just the same. The numerical results represented on the Figure 1 and Figure 2 are in a good accordance with that statement.

Figure 1. Here the zeros of Pad´e polynomials Pn,0(z), Pn,1(z) of order n = 100 for the function f given by (42) are plotted (blue points for Pn,0 and red points for Pn,1). These zeros simulate the segment  = [-1, 1] which is the Stahl compact set for f . Also the zeros of type I HP-polynomials Qn,0(z), Qn,1(z) and Qn,2(z) of order n = 200 for the tuple [1, f, f 2] are plotted (blue points for Qn,0, red points for Qn,1 and
black points for Qn,2). Those zeros simulate the S-compact set  from Proposition 4 which is symmetric with respect to the real line (cf. Fig. 2).

of type I HP-polynomials Qn,1(z) and Qn,2(z) of order n = 200 for the tuple [1, 1/(z2 - 1)1/2, f ] are plotted (red points for Qn,1 and black points
