ABSTRACT
Hierarchical analysis of the binary black hole (BBH) detections by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors has offered an increasingly clear picture of their mass, spin, and redshift distributions. Fully understanding the formation and evolution of BBH mergers will require not just the characterization of these marginal distributions, though, but the discovery of any correlations that exist between the properties of BBHs. Here, we hierarchically analyze the ensemble of BBHs discovered by the LIGO and Virgo with a model that allows for intrinsic correlations between their mass ratios q and effective inspiral spins eff . At 98.7% credibility, we find that the mean of the eff distribution varies as a function of q, such that more unequal-mass BBHs exhibit systematically larger eff . We find Bayesian odds ratio of 10.5 in favor of a model that allows for such a correlation over one that does not. While many proposed astrophysical formation channels predict some degree correlation between spins and mass ratio, these predicted correlations typically act in an opposite sense to the trend we observationally identify in the data.

1. INTRODUCTION
The growing number of gravitational-wave detections made by the Advanced LIGO (LIGO Scientific Collaboration 2015) and Advanced Virgo (Virgo Collaboration 2015) observatories is enabling exploration of the stellarmass compact binary population at an ever accelerating pace. With data now available from the first three LIGO-Virgo observing runs (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2019a, 2020a), we are beginning to resolve interesting features in the mass, spin, and redshift distributions of binary black holes (BBHs) (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2020b; Roulet et al. 2020). The BBH primary mass spectrum is characterized by a power-law at low masses and a possible "bump" near 40 M , followed by a steeper decline and a possible secondary feature near 80 M (Fishbach & Holz 2017; Wysocki et al. 2019; Kim-

ball et al. 2020; Roulet et al. 2020; Tiwari & Fairhurst 2020; LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2020b). Black hole spins appear to be small but non-zero, and are oriented neither isotropically nor strictly parallel to the binaries' orbits but with some spread in spin-orbit tilt angles (Roulet & Zaldarriaga 2019; Wysocki et al. 2019; Biscoveanu et al. 2021; Miller et al. 2020). Meanwhile, the BBH merger rate likely increases with redshift at a rate comparable to cosmic star formation (Fishbach et al. 2018; Callister et al. 2020a; LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2020b, 2021a).
The distributions of black hole parameters encode a valuable range of astrophysical information, and may offer information about the processes governing compact binary birth and evolution. In addition to features in these one-dimensional distributions, correlations between parameters will be particularly valuable to identify and understand. Different proposed formation channels, for instance, predict a variety of distinctive correlations that may exist among compact binaries. One might, for example, expect a correlation between BBH mass and spin if black holes experience repeated hierarchical mergers in dense stellar environments (Portegies Zwart & McMillan 2002; McKernan et al. 2012;

Antonini & Rasio 2016; Fishbach et al. 2017; Gerosa & Berti 2017; Doctor et al. 2020; Rodriguez et al. 2019; Kimball et al. 2020). And the strength of tidal interactions among field binaries might conceivably regulate BH spins in a way that depends on their mass ratio (Hotokezaka & Piran 2017; Gerosa et al. 2018; Qin et al. 2018; Zaldarriaga et al. 2018; Bavera et al. 2020; Bavera et al. 2021).
Here, we report an apparent anti-correlation between the mass ratio and effective inspiral spins of binary black hole mergers: more extreme mass ratios correspond to larger effective spins. At mass ratios near unity, the effective spins of BBHs are consistent with a narrow distribution that is symmetric about zero. At unequal mass ratios, however, the BBH population exhibits preferentially positive effective spins, due to an overall shift of the effective spin distribution towards larger values. This behavior is generally inconsistent with predictions of the standard models of compact object formation discussed above.

2. RESIDUAL STRUCTURE IN THE MASS RATIO & EFFECTIVE SPIN PLANE

The LIGO & Virgo second gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC-2) contains 44 BBH candidates with false alarm rates below one per year (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2020a). For each of these 44 events, Fig. 1a shows the joint posterior probability on its mass ratio

which quantifies the mass-weighted average of the two component spins when projected parallel to the binary's orbital angular momentum. Here, m1 and m2  m1 are the primary and secondary masses of the component black holes, 1 and 2 are the dimensionless component spin magnitudes, and t1 and t2 are the angles made by each component spin relative to the binary orbital angular momentum. Each contour bounds the central 90% credible region for the given event, under default parameter estimation priors (see Appendix A), and black points mark the one-dimensional median eff and q estimates for each event.
Most events in the eff - q plane are consistent with mass ratios near unity and have effective spins clustered around eff  0. A smaller number including the events GW190517 and GW190412, appear to have effective

spins constrained away from zero. The event GW190412 is also the first BBH to have a confidently unequal mass ratio, with q  0.3 (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2020c). In Fig. 1a we have additionally highlighted the event GW190814. Like GW190412, GW190814 has a confidently unequal mass ratio, but its physical nature is unknown; its secondary mass m2  2.5 M may be either a very light black hole or an extraordinarily heavy neutron star (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2020d). If GW190814 is presumed to be a BBH, it nevertheless remains an outlier relative to the broader BBH popluation (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2020b). We will therefore neglect GW190814 in our analysis below unless stated otherwise (we return to this event in Sect. 4). Also visible in Fig. 1a is the well-known measurement degeneracy between eff and q, giving rise to the extended contours that curve down towards low q and large eff (Baird et al. 2013; Ng et al. 2018). It is difficult, however, to qualitatively draw any further conclusions about the population of BBHs; the data in Fig. 1a are subject to selection effects and considerable measurement uncertainties, both of which confound any information that might be gleaned by eye about underlying features in this plane.
As a first step, we can refine Fig. 1a by invoking a simple model for the BBH population. The posteriors in Fig. 1a are obtained via parameter estimation with broad, uninformative priors on eff and q. By hierarchically measuring the BBH population, we can reweight each posterior to a new population-informed prior, leveraging the ensemble of events to help us more accurately identify the properties of any one individual system. For the time being, we will assume that mass ratios and effective spins are uncorrelated, describing the population distribution of mass ratios via a power law,

p(q|m1, )  q,

with mmin/m1  q  1, and the distribution effective spins as a Gaussian (Roulet & Zaldarriaga 2019; Miller et al. 2020),

truncated on the interval -1  eff  1. We obtain posteriors on the parameters governing these distributions using the emcee Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). Alongside q and eff , we also hierarchically measure the ensemble distribution of primary masses and BBH redshifts. We assume that primary masses are distributed as a power law with a possible Gaussian peak, and a merger rate per comoving

Figure 1. Left (a): Effective spin and mass ratio posteriors for the 45 BBH candidates in the LIGO/Virgo GWTC-2 catalog (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2020a) with false alarm rates below 1 yr-1, as obtained under a default prior. Each shaded region bounds the central 90% credible posterior bounds for a given BBH, and black points mark the median eff and median q values for each event. Three individually notable events are highlighted. GW190412 has a precisely measured mass ratio constrained well away from unity, while GW190517 likely possesses a large, positive eff . Finally, GW190814 exhibits an extreme mass ratio, with a secondary that may either be a massive neutron star or a very light black hole. Due to the unknown nature of GW190814, this event is excluded from our analysis unless otherwise stated. Right (b): Posteriors for the 44 confident BBHs (excluding GW190814) under a new population-informed prior, obtained by hierarchically fitting the BBH population assuming a Gaussian distribution of effective spins [Eq. (4)] and a power-law mass ratio distribution [Eq. (3)]. Under a population-informed prior, the ensemble of posteriors has contracted to favor smaller values of eff and mass ratios nearer q  1.

volume that evolves as (1 + z) with redshift (Fishbach et al. 2018; Talbot & Thrane 2018; LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2019b, 2020b); these models are described in Appendix A, along with details of our hierarchical inference. Our resulting posteriors on µ, , and  are shown in Appendix B.
With this initial fit to the BBH population, we can update our measurements of eff and q for each BBH. Figure 1b illustrates these reweighted posteriors. The incorporation of a population-informed prior yields two major effects. First, all posteriors have contracted towards small eff , since we infer both the mean and standard deviation of the effective spin distribution to be small, with µ = 0.06+-00..0055 and  = 0.12-+00..0055. Second, since  = 1.1+-31..04 is inferred to be positive (favoring mass ratios near unity), many sources have also shifted upwards towards q  1.
We can now explore whether this baseline population model, with uncorrelated spin and mass ratio distributions, is a reasonably good fit to observation. The blue contours in Fig. 2a illustrate the expected density of detections in the eff - q plane, assuming our default population model is correct. These contours are obtained using a set simulated BBH signals injected into LIGO and Virgo data, reweighting the successfully

recovered injections to our baseline population model (see Appendix A). The expected detections are clustered at q  1, with eff values spread symmetrically about the population mean at eff  0.05. The collection of black points, meanwhile, shows 75 posterior draws from each of our 44 BBHs, also reweighted to a population-informed prior as in Fig. 1b. These posterior draws show a hint of asymmetry that is not present in the expected distribution of detections: even discounting GW190412 (which contributes the dense cluster of points near eff  0.2 and q  0.3 , samples drawn from observed posteriors are preferentially skewed right, towards positive eff values.
To better quantify the degree of tension (if any) that exists in Fig. 2a, we repeatedly generate and compare catalogs of eff - q samples consistent with GWTC2 with predicted catalogs of mock observations drawn from our baseline population model. We begin by choosing a random sample  = {, µ, , ...} drawn from our posterior on the population-level parameters. Given this value of , we reweight each BBH's posterior to the corresponding population and randomly draw a single posterior sample {eff , q} from every reweighted posterior to yield a catalog of 44 "Observed" values consistent with GWTC-2. Under this same proposed population , we

Least squares slope d/dq

Figure 2. Left (a): Locations of expected and observed detections in the eff - q plane. Blue contours show the expected density of future BBH detections, given hierarchical inference on GWTC-2 under the assumption that q and eff are uncorrelated. Black dots, meanwhile, show posterior draws (75 per event) from our set of BBHs in GWTC-2, reweighted to a populationinformed prior as in Fig. 1b. Right (b): A predictive check between these expected and observed detections. The blue histogram shows the distribution of least-squares slopes d/dq under repeated draws of 44 samples from the expected distribution of detections according to our population model. The black histogram, meanwhile, shows the corresponding distribution of slopes under repeated draws from GWTC-2 posteriors (one sample per event). While our base population model predicts slopes centered about zero, draws from event posteriors yield a distribution of slopes offset noticeably towards negative values. This tension is further explored in Sect. 3, in which we expand our population model to more parametrize and measure any correlations between q and eff .

similarly draw a "Predicted" catalog of mock observations, reweighting and drawing 44 events from the set of successfully found pipeline injections. For both the "Predicted" and "Observed" catalogs we can then compute a simple least-squares slope d/dq of the 44 samples in the eff - q plane. The white and blue histograms in Fig. 2b illustrate the distributions of these least-squares slopes, taken over many random draws of . If our baseline population model, in which eff and q are uncorrelated, were a good descriptor of GWTC-2, then draws from model should predict slopes consistent with observation. The distributions in Fig. 2b, though, exhibit a systematic offset from one another: whereas the baseline population model predicts slopes centered at zero (as it must, if eff and q are presumed independent), GWTC-2 observations preferentially yield negative slopes centered above d/dq = -0.1, with observed slopes lying below predicted ones 74% of the time.
3. MEASURING A CORRELATION BETWEEN EFFECTIVE SPIN AND MASS RATIO

GWTC-2 is suggestive of a tendency towards larger eff with smaller q, a trend that cannot be captured with the simple population model employed so far. Motivated by this tension, in this section we will expand our initial population model to allow for a correlation between effective spins and mass ratios and check whether the data are informative or agnostic about the existence of such a correlation.
We continue to describe the mass ratio distribution via Eq. (3), but modify our eff model such that its mean µ and log standard deviation log10  are now allowed to evolve linearly with q:

p(eff |q, µ,0, ,0, , )  exp

with

µ(µ,0, , q) = µ,0 + (q - 0.5)

(6)

and

log10 (,0, , q) = log10 ,0 + (q - 0.5). (7)

The baseline population model adopted in Sec. 2, with a power-law in mass ratio (Eq. 3) and an uncorrelated Gaussian in effective spins (Eq. 4), appears possibly inadequate in capturing the full range of structure exhibited by BBHs in the eff -q plane. As explored in Fig. 2,

The parameters  and  govern the degree of evolution of eff with mass-ratio; confidently constraining either parameter to be non-zero would indicate that the BBH effective spin distribution shifts in location or width with increasing q.

Figure 3. Posterior distributions on the parameters governing the mass ratio and effective spin distributions of BBHs, under a model in which the mean and standard deviation of the eff distribution are correlated with q via the parameters  and  [see Eqs. (5)]. The measurements appearing above each one-dimensional posterior correspond to median estimates and central 90% credible uncertainties. At 98.7% credibility,  is inferred to be negative, indicating a preference for an anticorrelation between the effective spins and mass ratios among BBHs in GWTC-2. Posteriors on the remaining hyperparameters used to describe the primary mass and redshift distribution are shown in Appendix B.

We repeat our hierarchical analysis of the BBH events in GWTC-2, now additionally measuring the slope parameters  and . We again fit simultaneously for the primary mass and redshift distributions of BBHs, as described in Appendix A. Figure 3 shows our resulting posteriors on the subset of parameters governing the spin and mass ratio distributions. At 98.7% credibility,  is constrained to be less than zero, indicating that the effective spin distribution among BBHs in GWTC-2 is anti-correlated with mass ratio, shifting towards larger eff at lower q.
Whereas we confidently conclude that the mean of the eff distribution evolves with q, we can say little about changes in the width of the eff distribution. Although we rule out very large values of , this parameter is

still permitted to be moderately positive (a broadening eff distribution towards small q), very negative (a narrowing distribution), or zero. Note also that the lower boundary on  as shown in Fig. 3 is set by our prior and not the data.
Figure 4 provides a more direct illustration of our posterior on µ(q) and log10 (q) as a function of mass ratio. In each subplot, black lines denote the median and central 90% credible bounds on µ(q) and log10 (q), while light blue traces show the result of individual draws from our posterior on {µ,0, log10 ,0, , }. Again, µ confidently exhibits evolution with mass ratio, with the 90% credible lower bound on µ at q = 0 constrained to sit above the 90% credible upper bound at q = 1. Our best measurement of µ(q) occurs at

Each blue trace represents a single draw from our posterior on the population level parameters from Fig. 3, while black lines mark the mean and central 90% credible bounds on µ(q) and (q) at a given mass ratio. The mean of the eff distribution is constrained to decrease with increasing q, while the data are consistent with a non-evolving width. In the lower panel, the shaded grey region denotes the region artificially excluded by our prior bounds on log 0 and  [see Eq. (7)].

q  0.8; the fact that we center Eq. (6) at q = 0.5 and not 0.8 is the source of the degeneracy between µ,0 and  seen in Fig. 3 above. In contrast, no evolution is evident for log10 (q): a horizontal line can be fit inside the 90% credible bounds shown, consistent with the fact that we do not exclude  = 0. Note that, since our posterior on  is bounded by our prior, a non-negligible fraction of the space in Fig. 4 is excluded a priori. The shaded grey area shows this region that is artificially excluded by our priors on log10 0 and .
Reweighting the posterior of each BBH via an updated population prior from our correlated eff -q model yields the results shown in Fig. 5. Relative to the posteriors obtained via standard parameter estimation (Fig. 1a) and the those obtained by reweighting to a standard uncorrelated population model (Fig. 1b), the reweighted posteriors in Fig. 5 exhibit a significant de-

Figure 5. Effective spin and mass ratio posteriors for BBHs among GWTC-2, reweighted to a new population-informed prior given by our hierarchical inference of the (possibly correlated) BBH q and eff distributions. Under a model that allows for linear correlations between q and the mean and width of the effective spin distribution, single event posteriors shift to preferentially lie along a "best-fit line" in the eff - q plane. Notably, the high-spin event GW190517 has shifted to more unequal mass ratios, and is now constrained to the same neighborhood as the unequal-mass event GW190412. If BBH mass ratio and spins are correlated, it therefore appears that GW190412 and GW190517 are two representatives of a shared class of BBH. Also shown are contours (dashed grey lines) of the 1.5PN coefficient governing the phase evolution of a gravitational-wave signal; measurement degeneracies between eff and q lie preferentially along these contours.

gree of "shrinkage," shifting to lie predominantly along the "best-fit" line characterized by   -0.5. The event GW190517, in particular, changes character considerably under under our updated population prior. Under standard parameter estimation priors, GW190517 appears to be a possible outlier in spin, with the largest eff measured among GWTC-2, but otherwise is consistent with a fairly typical mass ratio (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2020a). Under a population model that allows for correlated mass ratios and spins, however, the posterior of GW190517 shifts to favor significantly lower eff and q, moving to lie in the same neighborhood as GW190412. It therefore appears that GW190517 is very likely to be another confidently unequal mass event like GW190412. Moreover, neither GW190517 nor GW190412 appear to be outliers relative to the rest of the BBH population; both are quite consistent with the same linear trend favored by the other BBH observations.
Although the BBHs in GWTC-2 favor a eff distribution that evolves mass ratio, does this expanded model actually resolve the predictive tension discussed

As in Fig. 2b, a comparison of least-squares slopes d/dq of describing draws from the reweighted posteriors of observed BBHs to those slopes predicted by our population model that allows for eff - q correlations.

An expanded model that allows for correlations resolves this tension, yielding observed and predicted distributions centered at the same values.

in Fig. 2? We repeat the predictive exercise discussed in Sect. 2, repeatedly drawing a hyperparamter sample  = {, µ,0, ,0, , , ...}, generating "Observed" catalogs from our reweighted posteriors and "Predicted" catalogs from the population model, and recording their least squares slopes. The resulting distributions are shown in Fig. 6. The expectation values over these distributions are now in far better agreement, with the "Observed" and "Predicted" slopes having sample means of d/dq = -0.46 and -0.49, respectively.
4. SPURIOUS SOURCES OF APPARENT CORRELATION?
An anti-correlation of BBH effective spins with mass ratio is surprising, given current theories of compact binary formation and evolution. In this section, we therefore detail a number of checks to bolster our confidence that this anti-correlation is a real observed feature of our data, rather than a spurious effect due to uncontrolled systematics.
First, we explore whether our confident measurement of  < 0 can be traced to any one event. If so, this would not necessarily indicate that our results are spurious, but would suggest that the event in question is an outlier among the BBH population, or possibly that an error or bias is present in the data associated with this event. We repeat our hierarchical inference of the correlated eff -q model in Sect. 3 three additional times, excluding GW190412, excluding GW190517, and excluding both

events together. The resulting marginalized posteriors on  are shown in Fig. 7. The observed anti-correlation between eff and q remains appears robust against the exclusion of either event. Excluding GW190517 leaves our result effectively unchanged, with  < 0 at 99.1% credibility. The same is true of GW190412, whose exclusion gives  < 0 at 99.0% credibility. Finally, while excluding both GW190412 and GW190517 somewhat weakens our conclusions, in this case  is still constrained to be less than zero at 95.2% credibility. Therefore, although these two events notably aid in the precision with which  is measured, the preference for negative  appears to be a feature of the broader BBH population.
Similarly, adding in GW190814 does not change the requirement that  be negative. Due to its unknown source classification, we have so far excluded GW190814 from the set of BBHs informing our hierarchical inference (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2020d,b). If we repeat our analysis but now include GW190814 among our sample, we obtain the reweighted population shown in Fig. 8a, while Fig. 8b shows the updated posteriors on  and  when GW190814 is present. Given the very precise measurements of GW190814's mass ratio and effective spin, this event does not shift noticeably under a populationinformed prior. Its presence, though, doesn't override the tendency of the other BBHs to prefer anticorrelated eff and q. We still confidently infer  < 0, although the strength of this measurement, now at 92.6% credibility,

Figure 8. Hierarchical inferences results and reweighted single-event posteriors when the outlier event GW190814 is included in our BBH sample. The inclusion of GW190814 diminishes our confidence that the mean of the eff distribution evolves with mass ratio. Instead, this event leads us to conclude that the width of the eff distribution likely increases with decreasing q. Comparing the left-hand panel to the reweighted posteriors in Fig. 5 (in which GW190814 is excluded from the fit), the bulk of the BBH events still cluster along a best fit line, but, in order to additionally accommodate the precisely-measured properties of GW190814, exhibit with an increasing degree of scatter about this line at smaller mass ratios.

is slightly reduced. GW190814's primary effect, however, is to broaden the eff distribution towards lower q; we now infer that  < 0 at 96.8% credibility (although the exact significance will depend on our lower prior bound on ). Qualitatively, since all other BBHs force  < 0, the only way for our population model to simultaneously accommodate GW190814 is also to broaden at very low q. This effect can be seen when comparing the reweighted posteriors in Figs. 5 and 8a: whereas the median measurements (black points) in Fig. 5 obey a tight linear correlation, those in Fig. 8a exhibit visibly increased scatter as we move towards small q.
It could alternatively be the case that biases due to our choice of mass model or systematic uncertainties in the Advanced LIGO & Virgo selection function yield an artificial preference for  < 0. The fact that our mass ratio distribution p(q|m1) is specified as conditional on m1 implies that our conclusions regarding q, and hence also our conclusions regarding correlations between q and eff , are possibly impacted by our choice for p(m1). Our results, though, appear robust against different choices for the form of p(m1). So far, we have shown results obtained while assuming p(m1) is a power law with a Gaussian peak (the Power Law+Peak model of LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2020b). If we instead adopt a broken power law form for p(m1), our conclusions are virtually unchanged. As discussed in Appendix A, meanwhile, we account for selection effects

in O3 by using the results of an actual injection campaign into Advanced LIGO & Virgo data (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2020a,b,e). Analogous injections are not available for the O1 and O2 observing runs, however; for these observing runs we instead estimate the LIGO & Virgo selection function using a publicly-available set of mock events that pass a semi-analytic signal-to-noise ratio cut (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2020f). It is conceivable that this semi-analytic calculation biases us in unexpected ways. To check this possibility, we have verified that our results hold when performing hierarchical analysis using only those events detected in O3a, thereby avoiding any possibility of bias due to the O1 and O2 selection function.
Another possible concern is the well-known fact that measurements of individual events' eff and q exhibit a large degree of correlation (Cutler & Flanagan 1994; Poisson & Will 1995; Baird et al. 2013; Ng et al. 2018). Both the effective spin and mass ratio appear in the 1.5PN coefficient in the post-Newtonian expansion of a BBH's phase evolution. As it is this coefficient that is most readily extracted from a gravitational-wave observation, the resulting individual measurements of eff and q are quite degenerate with one another, particularly in the case of low-mass systems for which the inspiral (rather than merger and ringdown) contributes the bulk of the observed signal-to-noise. This degeneracy can be

seen in Fig. 1; if examined closely, the posteriors for several individual events take the form of extended arcs that curve down and to the right, towards large eff and small q. Since this degeneracy acts in the same direction as the eff -q anti-correlation we identify, one might wonder if our observation of an anti-correlation is just a relic of these measurement degeneracies, rather than an intrinsic feature of the underlying BBH population.
If the Bayesian parameter estimation of individual gravitational-wave events is unbiased, hierarchical Bayesian inference is robust against measurement degeneracies. Large degeneracies may well inflate our uncertainties on the properties of the underlying BBH population, but will not lead to a erroneous identification of some spurious feature or correlation. In practice, though, we cannot be absolutely confident in the complete and unbiased coverage of parameter estimation. The properties of the massive BBHs GW151226 and GW190521, for example, are still under debate due to the possible existence of additional posterior modes identified upon reanalysis of LIGO/Virgo data (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2016, 2020g; Nitz & Capano 2021; Estell´es et al. 2021; MateuLucena et al. 2021; Chia et al. 2021). Moreover, it is in principle possible for small but systematic errors in our estimates of parameter estimation priors, a critical ingredient in hierarchical inference, to have an outsized cumulative impact on our population-level results.
As a first step, we can qualitatively check to what degree our population-level eff - q anti-correlation and the eff - q measurement degeneracies lie in the same direction. The 1.5PN phase correction may be written 1.5 = (Mcf )-2/3 1.5, with the coefficient (Cutler & Flanagan 1994; Poisson & Will 1995; Baird et al. 2013; Ng et al. 2018)

Here, Mc is the binary chirp mass,  is the reduced mass ratio,  = (m1 - m2)/(m1 + m2), and a = (1 cos t1 - 2 cos t2)/2. The dashed lines in Fig. 5 trace contours of equal 1.5, assuming that a = 0. It is along these contours that measurement degeneracies between q and eff preferentially lie. Note that different choices for a will change the exact contours drawn but that these differences are small, since the influence of a in Eq. (8) is suppressed by a factor of  relative to the term involving eff . If our hierarchical inference were contaminated by measurement degeneracies, we expect that our analysis would favor a correlation lying parallel to these constant-in-phase contours. Qualitatively, however, the slope   -0.45 favored by the BBH population dif-

fers noticeably from these contours at the mass ratios q 0.6 where most detections lie.
More concretely, we also verify that measurement degeneracies do not reproducibly confound our analysis by performing an end-to-end injection, recovery, and hierarchical inference of a mock population of BBH events. We randomly draw a large set of BBHs from a broad reference population (see Appendix C for additional details), down-selecting to 5×104 "found" events that have a matched-filter network signal-to-noise ratio   10 across LIGO-Hanford, LIGO-Livingston, and Virgo. As we are concerned only with eff , for simplicity we work only with aligned spins, using the IMRPhenomD waveform model (Husa et al. 2016; Khan et al. 2016). From our large sample of found injections, we randomly draw N = 50 to comprise our "observed" catalog on which we will perform parameter estimation and hierarchical inference. In drawing this catalog, we assign draw probabilities such that our injected population has µ0 = 0.05, 0 = 0.15,  = 0, and  = 0, with no intrinsic correlation between eff and q. Additionally, we deliberately introduce a mismatch between the injected distribution of primary masses and the distribution assumed on recovery; while primary masses are drawn from a broken power law, we will fit this population using the same power law and Gaussian peak mixture adopted above.
We perform parameter estimation on each of these 50 events using Bilby (Ashton et al. 2019; Romero-Shaw et al. 2020) in conjunction with the Dynesty (Speagle 2020) nested sampler. Figure 9a shows the posteriors we recover from our injections under a default parameter estimation prior. This ensemble of posteriors displays (partially by design) many of the same qualitative features of GWTC-2 seen above in Fig. 1a, with most events clustered near small eff and moderately large q, a handful of posteriors whose medians are displaced towards positive eff , and several events exhibiting the curving degeneracy characteristic of joint eff and q measurements. Finally, we use the set of resulting posterior samples to hierarchically analyze our injected population, employing the population model described in Sect. 3 to fit for any correlations between eff and q, obtaining the posteriors on  and  shown in Fig. 9b We recover µ0 and 0 estimates consistent with our injected values, finding µ,0 = 0.05+-00..0099 and log10 ,0 = 0.13+-00..0097 (medians and central 90% credible uncertainties). More importantly, our results are consistent with no correlations between effective spin and mass ratio. Our posteriors allow quite comfortably for  = 0 and  = 0, which lies on a contour enclosing 38% of the probability in the  -  plane. Hence we correctly conclude that our injected population exhibits

Each contour encloses the central 90% credible region for a given event, while black points mark one-dimensional medians on q and eff . These mock detections are drawn from a population with no intrinsic correlations between q and eff , but with parameters otherwise consistent with those of GWTC-2. Our resulting posteriors display the same key features as those of real BBH detections in Fig. 1a, including measurement degeneracy between q and eff . Right (b): Inferred posteriors on the parameters governing correlations between q and eff [see Eqs. (6) and (7)] when performing hierarchical analysis on the mock catalog. Our results are consistent with  =  = 0, correctly reflecting the fact that our underlying injections possess no intrinsic correlations between q and eff . As discussed further in the text, we further test the stability of this result by deliberately analyzing this population with an incorrect mass model (power law with a Gaussian peak; green). Results obtained using the correct mass model from which injections are drawn (broken power law) are shown via the dashed histograms.

no correlations between eff and q. As noted above, we deliberately perform our hierarchical inference with an incorrect mass model. For completeness, the dashed histograms in Fig. 9b show the marginal posteriors obtained on  and  if we instead our injection set with the correct mass model (a broken power law in primary mass). Our conclusions regarding  are effectively unchanged between these two cases.
This injection case study does not, of course, serve as proof that there are no unknown sources of bias in GWTC-2. It does, however, demonstrate that a false-positive identification of eff and q does not readily appear when hierarchically analyzing fully realistic BBH posteriors, particularly those posteriors that exhibit measurement degeneracy between mass ratio and effective spin.
5. ASTROPHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS
The physical implications of an anti-correlation between q and eff are unclear. There are generally two approaches one might take in attempting to explain this relationship. First, such an anti-correlation could conceivably arise from processes acting within a single population of BBHs arising from a common formation channel. Second, a global anti-correlation could arise if ob-

served BBHs originate from some superposition of formation channels, with some favoring high q and low eff and others yielding high eff with low q. We comment on each of these possibilities in turn.
BBHs arising from isolated stellar binaries have spins that result from a complex interplay of angular momentum transport in stellar cores, tidal torques operating between stars, and episodes of mass transfer (Spruit 2002; Gerosa et al. 2018; Qin et al. 2018; Zaldarriaga et al. 2018; Belczynski et al. 2020; Fuller & Ma 2019; Bavera et al. 2020; Bavera et al. 2021). The details of the latter two processes depend on binary mass ratio, and so might impart a relationship between q and eff . The generally predicted relationship between q and eff , however, appears to differ from the relationship we see here observationally. Bavera et al. (2020), for instance, predicts that BBHs originating from common envelope (CE) exhibit an increased scatter in eff towards positive values with increasing q. Bavera et al. (2021) later identify a similar trend among binaries that undergo Eddington-limited stable mass transfer. In our analysis, this would effect would manifest as positive values for  and ; this possibility is ruled out at high credibility. We do note, though, that the simulations of Bavera et al. (2021) do appear to identify two special cases

in which isolated BBHs could exhibit anti-correlated q and eff . CE binaries with very high common-envelope efficiencies and stable mass transfer binaries with superEddington accretion (e.g. fourth row in Fig. G.2 and third row in Fig. G.3 of Bavera et al. 2021, respectively) each predict structure in the eff - q plane that is at least qualitatively similar to the behavior we find here.
Dynamically-assembled binaries in dense stellar clusters may also naturally exhibit a correlation between q and eff if they experience repeated, hierarchical mergers. The heavy remnants of BBH mergers are generically rapidly rotating, with spins centered around   0.7. If these "second-generation" black holes subsequently undergo additional mergers with "first-generation" black holes, the result will be a population of BBHs observed with very unequal mass ratios and preferentially large spins (Fishbach et al. 2017; Gerosa & Berti 2017; Doctor et al. 2020; Rodriguez et al. 2019; Kimball et al. 2020; Gerosa & Fishbach 2021). In the absence of any preferred directions, though, the result will be a broadening of the eff distribution towards smaller q (e.g. negative ). This prediction is at odds with the fact that the data prefer larger but preferentially positive effective spins with smaller mass ratio.
As noted above, an alternative interpretation is that the BBHs observed in GWTC-2 are a mixture of populations arising from distinct formation channels (e.g. Franciolini et al. 2021; Wong et al. 2021; Zevin et al. 2021); in this picture the measured q vs. eff anti-correlation arises from the presence of two or more sub-populations that manifest in the eff - q plane. As discussed in Sect. 3, both GW190412 and GW190517 lie in the same area of this plane when reweighted to a populationinformed prior, each exhibiting small q and confidently positive eff . Chia et al. (2021) have also recently argued that GW151226 also exhibits similar characteristics when re-analyzed with a waveform model including spin precessing and higher order radiation modes (Pratten et al. 2020). These events might together suggest the presence of a secondary sub-population appearing at low q and high eff .
If we assume that GWTC-2 comprises a mixture of BBHs arising from isolated stellar evolution, with purely positive eff , and systems forming dynamically in stellar clusters, with isotropic spin orientations, we can attempt to characterize the implied mixture fraction between these two populations as a function of mass ratio. Using our hierarchical measurement of {µ0, 0, , }, in Fig. 10 we show our posterior on the fraction

of events with negative effective spins versus q. Individual blue traces show the result of single draws from our posterior on parameters governing the spin-mass ratio distribution, while solid black lines show the mean and central 90% credible bounds on fneg(q). At q  1, the data are consistent with half (or even more) of all systems exhibiting negative effective spins. At low q, meanwhile, our inferred mean on the eff distribution has shifted to larger positive values, and so the fraction of systems with negative eff is likely quite small.
If we very simplistically assume that BBHs formed dynamically in dense clusters exhibit a symmetric eff distribution, while BBHs arising in the field can possess only positive eff , then we obtain crude estimates

and

ffield(q) = 1 - 2fneg(q)

of the mixture fractions between channels as a function of q. The result is shown in Fig. 11. At q  1, the fraction of BBHs arising in clusters is at least fdyn  0.5, or as high as one (note that some individual traces rise unphysically to values fdyn > 1). Below q  0.8, meanwhile, it is likely that fdyn drops precipitously while the fraction ffield of systems formed in the field rises towards unity. The rapid transition at q  0.8 corresponds to the mass ratio at which µ(q) and (q) are each most precisely measured; see Fig. 4.

The implied fractions of BBHs arising from toy "dynamical" (bottom) and "isolated field binary" (top) formation channels, assuming that the former yields a eff distribution symmetric about zero, while the latter yields exclusively positive effective spins. Blue traces mark individual draws from the hyperposterior in Fig. 3, and black traces denote medians and central 90% credible bounds. As in Fig. 10, these results assume that the eff distribution at a given q is well-described by a Gaussian that extends to negative eff , although this assumption is not necessarily independently supported by observation.

unequal mass ratios, is surprising. Theoretical modeling and population synthesis generally predict the opposite, such that BBHs formed in clusters have more unequal mass ratios than those formed in the field, due to the possibility of exchanges during three-body encounters and/or hierarchical mergers (Bouffanais et al. 2019; Di Carlo et al. 2020; Bouffanais et al. 2021).
In constructing and interpreting Figs. 10 and 11, it is important to explore whether the constraints on fneg(q) arise from informative data, or whether they are simply extrapolations based on the Gaussian model we adopt for p(eff |q). When neglecting the possibility of correlations between q and eff , the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration (2020b) found evidence for negative effective spins among GWTC-2. In particular, when fitting the eff with a Gaussian truncated between eff,min  eff  1, for some unknown eff,min, this lower truncation bound was inferred to be negative at high credibility. This evidence for negative effective spins was corroborated via an alternative model that

directly fit for the spin magnitudes and tilt angles of component black holes. Callister et al. (2020b) hierarchically modeled the eff distribution not as Gaussian, but as the convolution of an underlying component spin distribution with a distribution of natal kicks experienced during the core-collapse of black hole progenitors. The results of this analysis too indicated the presence of negative eff .
These conclusions, though, were generally based on models that did not include correlations between q and eff . To understand the extent to which negative effective spins remain required by the data, we use the Dynesty nested sampler (Speagle 2020) to compute Bayesian evidences between the following four possibilities:
· Independent eff and q distributions ( =  = 0), with eff truncated on [-1, 1] as in Eq. (4).
· Independent eff and q, with purely positive eff . In this case, Eq. (4) is truncated on [0, 1], with a restricted prior 0  µ  1 on its mean.
· Correlated eff and q (with possibly non-zero  and ), with eff truncated on [-1, 1] as in Eq. (5).
· Correlated eff and q, with purely positive eff . Equation (5) is truncated on [0, 1], and we adopt a restricted prior enforcing 0  µ,0  1.
In each case we use the same modeling assumptions and priors as listed in Appendix A, unless otherwise noted.
Table 1 lists the (natural) log-Evidences for these four models, scaled such that the most-disfavored model has ln Evidence = 0. The most favored model is one that allows for both a eff - q correlation and negative effective spins, with a Bayes factor ln B = 3.64 relative to

a model including neither effect. However, allowing for eff -q correlations appears to weaken evidence for negative effective spins; we find a nearly-uninformative Bayes factor ln B = 0.10 between our most favored model and one that allows for correlated eff and q but without negative eff . As the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors continue adding to the list of BBH detections, it will be important to revisit this model comparison, refining the evidence (or lack thereof) for negative effective spins and understanding the extent to which conclusions regarding negative eff and/or correlations between parameters can confound one another.
Finally, it should be emphasized that despite our focus on BBH formation via "canonical" field binary and cluster scenarios, these are certainly not the only two options that exist. Other possible avenues for BBH formation and merger include hierarchical triples (Liu & Lai 2017, 2018; Antonini et al. 2018; Rodriguez & Antonini 2018; Martinez et al. 2020) and BBH assembly in the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN; McKernan et al. 2018, 2019; Stone et al. 2017; Tagawa et al. 2020); it is not well-understood what kinds of q and eff correlations might arise under these alternative scenarios. AGN disks, in particular, offer opportunities for hierarchical BBH mergers while maintaining a preferred direction (set by the accretion disk's angular momentum), and thus might be able to explain the q - eff anticorrelation we observe here.
6. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have presented evidence for an intrinsic anti-correlation between the effective spins and mass ratios of detected BBH mergers. Under a hierarchical analysis of the BBH population using Advanced LIGO and Virgo's GWTC-2 catalog, we find that equal-mass binaries preferentially exhibit a narrow eff distribution centered at zero, while unequal mass events favor a eff distribution systematically shifted towards larger, positive values.
This anti-correlation is unexpected. As discussed in Sect. 5, it is not clear what physical processes might give rise to such an effect; in fact, standard ideas about BBH formation via isolated stellar evolution and dynamical assembly in dense clusters make predictions at odds with the trend we discover here. For this reason, we have attempted to critically examine and test various sources of bias or systematic uncertainty that might lead to a spurious conclusions regarding the joint eff -q distribution in BBH mergers. In Sect. 4, we found that the observed anti-correlation between q and eff could not be clearly attributed to selection effects, measure-

13
ment degeneracies, or a small number of outlier events among the BBH population.
Looking ahead, the continued detection of additional BBHs by Advanced LIGO and Virgo (to be joined soon by the KAGRA experiment; Akutsu et al. 2020) will be crucial to better understand the intrinsic relationship between q and eff , further bolstering our conclusions or pointing instead to a statistical fluctuation or as-of-yet unknown systematic. Simultaneously, it will be valuable to re-evaluate our understanding of BBH formation in light of the results presented here, exploring which formation channel (or combination of channels) can accommodate the observed trend in q and eff . If confirmed to be astrophysical, the anti-correlated mass ratios and effective spins of BBHs may offer a firm observational foothold on our path towards understanding the origin of black hole mergers.

APPENDIX
A. HIERARCHICAL INFERENCE OF THE BBH POPULATION
Here we discuss details of our hierarchical inference of the BBH population with GWTC-2. We model the primary mass distribution following the Power Law + Peak model of Talbot & Thrane (2018) and LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration (2020b), in which primary BBH masses are described as a mixture

p(m1|fp, , µm, m, mmax) = fp P (m1|, mmax) + (1 - fp)N (m1|µm, m, mmax)

(A2)

The additional factor of (1 + z)-1 in Eq. (A2) converts a uniform-in-time source-frame distribution to our detector

frame. We adopt cosmological parameters consistent with those reported in Ade et al. (2016).

As discussed in the main text, we explore two related models for the mass ratio and effective spin distribution of

BBHs. In Sect. 2, we first consider the case in which these parameters are uncorrelated, describing the conditional

distribution p(q|m1, ) of mass ratios as a power law with index  and the distribution p(eff |µ, ) of effective spin parameters as a Gaussian with mean µ and standard deviation ; see Eqs. (3) and (4). In Sect. 3 and beyond, we subsequently expand this model to allow for population-level correlations between the mass ratios and spins of BBHs.

In particular, we preserve the Gaussian form for p(eff ), but now allow its mean and standard deviation to vary as a function of mass ratio; see Eqs. (5), (6), and (7).

Together, we hierarchically fit the collection of hyperparameters that govern the BBH population by considering the

Ndet = 44 BBH candidates among GWTC-2 with false alarm rates below one per year (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2020a). We make use of the parameter estimation results described in LIGO Scientific

Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration (2019a, 2020a) and made publicly available through the Gravitational-Wave

Open Science Center (Vallisneri et al. 2015; LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2020h,i,j, 2021b).

For BBHs first announced in GWTC-1, we use the Overall Posterior samples formed by the union of results

under two different waveform families. For BBHs observed in LIGO and Virgo's O3a observing run, we use the

PrecessingSpinIMRHM samples generated by waveforms including the effects of spin precession and higher-order modes.

Given posteriors p(i|di) on the individual parameters i (e.g. component masses, spins, etc.) of each event conditioned on its observed data di, the corresponding posterior on the population parameters  is (Loredo 2004; Taylor & Gerosa 2018; Mandel et al. 2019; Vitale et al. 2020)

This form of the likelihood includes implicit marginalization over the overall rate of BBH mergers, using a log-uniform prior on the expected number of detections (Fishbach et al. 2018; Mandel et al. 2019). In Eq. (A3), ppe(i) is the default prior adopted for purposes of parameter estimation and () is the population-weighted detection efficiency, discussed further below. Parameter estimation for GWTC-2 is achieved using priors that are uniform in detector frame masses and Euclidean volume, corresponding to an implicit prior (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration 2019a, 2020a; Callister 2021)

of Callister (2021). Meanwhile, p() is our prior on the population-level parameters. Unless stated otherwise, we use the priors listed in Table 2. We still cannot yet employ Eq. (A3), since we do not have direct access underlying posteriors p(i | di), but instead have a collection of discrete samples drawn from each event's posterior. Instead, we replace integration over p(i|di) with an ensemble average taken over the posterior samples associated with each event:

Ndet
p( | {di})  p() -Ndet ()
i=1

p(i|) ppe(i)

.

(A5)

We sample over Eq. (A5) using the emcee Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013), to

obtain the posteriors shown in Figs. 3, 12, and 13. When computing and comparing Bayesian evidences in Sect. 5, we

instead implement and integrate over Eq. (A5) using the Dynesty nested sampler (Speagle 2020).

In Eqs. (A3) and (A5), the detection efficiency () quantifies the fraction of events that we expect to pass our

detection critera, given a population described by :

() = d Pdet() p(|).

(A6)

Here, Pdet() is the detection probability for a particular event with parameters . The detection efficiency corrects for search selection effects and so is critical to accurately calculate. We estimate () using the injection campaign

reported in LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration (2020b,e), selecting successfully found injections

(with recovered false alarm rates below one per year in at least one pipeline) and reweighting to the proposed population

where Ninj is the total number of injections (including those that are not recovered) and pinj() is the reference
distribution from which injections were drawn. As discussed in LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration (2020e), the injected masses follow pinj(m1)  m1-2.35 for 2 M  m1  100 M and p(q|m1)  q2. The injections additionally have purely aligned component spins (1 = 2 = 0 or ) distributed uniformly between -1  z  1; the

Callister et al.

One operation frequently performed in this paper is the reweighting of single-event posteriors from the default prior ppe() adopted for parameter estimation to some new population-informed prior based on our hierarchical inference of . If we denote by ppe(|d) the posterior obtained through standard parameter estimation, then via Bayes' theorem, the reweighted posterior corresponding to some particular value of  is

p(|d, )  ppe(|d)

p(|) ppe()

.

(A9)

We do not, of course, measure  perfectly. What we instead want is a reweighted posterior p(|d) = dp(|d, )p() that has been marginalized over our uncertainty on the underlying population. Given an original set of samples {}pe drawn from ppe(|d) and a set of hyperparameter samples {} generated by our population fit, we can obtain a new set of samples drawn from this reweighted and marginalized posterior by doing the following:

1. Randomly select a hyperparameter sample i  {}
2. For each sample j  {}pe, compute the weights wj = p(j|d, i)/ppe(j) that correspond to the parenthetical in Eq. (A9)

3. Randomly select and store a posterior sample j according to weights wj

4. Repeat

Another operation performed in Sects. 2 and 3 is the generation of predicted observations, marginalized over the parameters of a particular population model. This proceeds in a manner similar to posterior reweighting, but instead using the pipeline injection sets that inform our calculation of () above:

1. Randomly select a hyperparameter sample i  {}
2. For each found injection, with parameters j, compute weights wj = p(j|i)/pinj(j) to reweight from the injected reference distribution to the proposed population

3. Randomly select and store one found injection according to the weights wj

4. Repeat

B. DETAILED PARAMETER ESTIMATION RESULTS
Here, we show additional parameter estimation results neglected in the main text. Figure 12 shows posteriors on the parameters governing the BBH effective spin and mass ratio distributions under the base model discussed in Sect. 2, without the possibility of q -eff correlations. Under this base model, we infer an effective spin distribution distribution centered near eff  0.05 with a standard deviation of   0.1. Our posteriors on parameters governing the primary mass and redshift distributions are effectively identical to those presented in LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration (2020b), and so we do not show their complete posteriors here, although we include their one dimensional marginal distributions in Fig. 13 below.
In Fig. 3 in the main text, we showed the joint posterior on parameters governing the BBH mass ratio and spin distribution under our expanded model allow for correlations between these parameters. Figure 13 shows the posterior on the remaining parameters when including the effects of q - eff correlation. There are no significant correlations between the parameters plotted in Fig. 3 and those plotted here. Allowing for a q - eff correlation minimally impacts our conclusions regarding the primary mass and redshift distributions of BBHs. For comparison, the unfilled grey distributions in Fig. 13 show posteriors obtained using the base model from Sect. 2; these are generally identical to the posteriors obtained from the expanded model (in blue). The largest shift occurs in the posterior for the width m of the Gaussian peak in m1. However, m remains effectively unconstrained in both models.
C. RECOVERY OF SIMULATED EVENTS
In Sect. 4 we described an end-to-end injection study, entailing the parameter estimation and hierarchical analysis of mock signals. This test allowed us to verify that realistic measurement degeneracies between q and eff do not seem to generically bias our conclusions regarding underlying correlations between these two parameters. Here, we describe some additional details regarding our generation and analysis of these mock events.

Figure 12. Posteriors on the parameters governing the mass ratio and effective spin distributions of BBHs, under the base model in Sect. 2 with no correlations between q and eff . The labels above each one-dimensional posterior give the medians and central 90% credible uncertainties on each parameter, while the contours in each two-dimensional posterior enclose the 50% and 90% credible regions. Posteriors on the remaining parameters governing the BBH primary mass and redshift distributions are effectively identical to those recovered in LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration (2020b). For reference, though, the one-dimensional marginalized posteriors on these other parameters are shown as unfilled grey histograms in Fig. 13 below.

We first randomly draw a large number of BBHs from a mock population with masses between mmin = 5 M and mmax = 100 M , redshift evolution described by  = 2, and a mass ratio distribution with  = 0.5. We assume a broad eff distribution with µ,0 = 0, ,0 = 1,  = 0, and  = 0; note that this is not the spin distribution that we ultimately inject and analyze. Since we are concerned only with eff and not the individual component spins, we set aligned spin components to 1,z = 2,z = eff and in-plane components to zero. We draw primary masses from a broken power law, with p(m1)  m-1 2 for m1 < 35 M and p(m1)  m-1 4 for m1  35 M , introducing a deliberate mismatch between the mass distribution of events we inject and the model we eventually assume upon recovery. Events are given random inclinations and sky positions. We use PyCBC (Nitz et al. 2021) to compute the expected signal-to-noise ratio  of each event assuming a network composed of LIGO-Hanford, LIGO-Livingston, and Virgo, using the "O3 actual" noise power spectral densities provided in LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration (2020k) and the IMRPhenomD aligned-spin waveform model (Husa et al. 2016; Khan et al. 2016). We consider events with   10 to have been "detected," and proceed until we have 5 × 104 such events. This set of found events now serves two purposes. First, it provides us a large pool from which to draw a small catalog of mock detections comparable in size to GWTC-2. Second, this pool will allow us to quantify the appropriate selection effects when performing hierarchical inference on our mock catalog, just as the set of pipeline injections described in Appendix A allowed us to correct for selection effects when analyzing GWTC-2.
From our set of 5×104 events, we next randomly draw 50 that will comprise our mock injection catalog. In randomly choosing events, each event is assigned a draw weight proportional to N (eff |0.05, 0.15)/N (eff |0, 1), so that our catalog corresponds to a much narrower effective spin distribution with µ,0 = 0.05 and ,0 = 0.15, rather than the broad reference distribution used above to generate our initial pool. We use Bilby (Ashton et al. 2019; Romero-Shaw et al. 2020) together with the Dynesty (Speagle 2020) nested sampler to perform parameter estimation on these 50 events, adding to each signal a random noise realization consistent with the "O3 actual" power spectral densities noted above. Parameter estimation is performed using the IMRPhenomD aligned-spin waveform model (Husa et al. 2016; Khan et al. 2016), with priors that are uniform in detector-frame mass and Euclidean volume [Eq. (A4)] and uniform in aligned

Figure 13. Posteriors on parameters governing the primary mass and redshift distributions of BBHs, under the expanded model described in Sect. 3 that allows for correlations between q and eff . Posteriors on the parameters governing the q and eff distributions are shown in Fig. 3 in the main text. The numbers above each one-dimensional posterior quote medians and central 90% credible uncertainties, and the two contours appearing in each two-dimensional posterior enclose the central 50% and 90% credible regions. For comparison, the unfilled grey histograms show the constraints on these parameters obtained under the base model of Sect. 2 that neglects any correlations between q and eff ; see also Fig. 12 above.

component spins, corresponding to a eff prior given by Eq. (A8). This is not the same as the eff prior implied by a uniform and isotropic prior on component spins, the default choice used by the LIGO and Virgo Collaborations, which is much more tightly concentrated about eff = 0. In order to allow for a self-consistent comparison between Figs. 1a and 9a, the posterior samples in Fig. 9a have been therefore been reweighted from their original aligned spin prior to the eff prior arising from isotropic spins (Eq. (10) of Callister 2021).
