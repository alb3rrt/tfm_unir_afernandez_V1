Abstract: Gluons are strong interaction gauge fields which interact between quarks, i.e. constituents of baryons and mesons. Interaction of matters is phenomenologically described by gauge theory of strong, electromagnetic, weak and gravitational interactions. In electroweak theory, left handed leptons lL and neutrino L, right handed leptons lR and left handed quarks uL, dL and right handed quarks uR, dR follow SU (2) × U (1) symmetry. Charge of leptons and quarks define hypercharge Y , and via Higgs mechanism SU (2)L × U (1)Y symmetry forms U (1)em symmetry.
Presence of JP = 3/2+ baryons, or N ++  uuu suggests a new degree of freedom "color" for quarks, which follows SU (3) symmetry group. Hence the gluon fields are expressed as Aaµ where a = 1, 2, · · · , 8 specify the color SU (3) bases, and µ are 4dimensional space-time coordinates. The quantum electrodynamics was extended to quantum chromo dynamics (QCD). Since µAaµ is not a free field, the gauge theory requires ghosts that compensates unphysical degrees of freedom of gluons. Gluons, ghosts, leptons and quarks are related by Becchi-Rouet-Stora -Tyuitin (BRST) transformation of electroweak and strong interaction of the U (1) × SU (2) × SU (3) symmetric Faddeev-Popov Lagrangian.
In order to describe Hadron dynamics properly, embedding of 4-dimensional space to 5-dimensional space was tried in lattice simulations, and in light front holographic QCD (LFHQCD) approach in which conformally symmetric light-front dynamics without ghost are embedded in AdS5, and a parameter that fixes a mass scale was chosen from the Principle of Maximum Conformality. Coulomb or Landau gauge fixed Faddeev-Popov YangMills field equation is known to have the Gribov ambiguity, and tunneling between vacua between different topological structures was proposed by van Baal and collaborators. The symmetry of three colors can be assigned three vectors of quaternion H, whose multiplication on 2 × 2 matrices of Dirac spinors on S3 induces transformations. Instantons or sphalerons whose presence is expected from conformal equivalence of S3 × R to R4 are reviewed. An extension of the dynamics embedded in complex projective space is also discussed.

1. Introduction

Furui, Sadataka

Feynman discusses on the problem of self-mass of charged particles in the section 28-4[2]

that "charges must be held to the sphere by some kind of rubber bands-something that

keeps the charges from flying off. It was first pointed out by Poincare´ [3] that the rubber

bands -or whatever it is that holds the electron together-must be included in the energy

and momentum calculation". He presented that the difference of the electromagnetic mass

m(1) = Uelec/c2 where Uelec is calculated from 0E2, where E is the electric field produced

by the static charge, and m(2) calculated from momentum derived from the poynting vector

are related by m(2)

m(1),

and

it

was

explained

by

Dirac[4]

as

effects of self energy of the charged particle. Feynman pointed out ambiguity in the self

energy.

In order to study interaction of hadrons, solving Dyson-Schwinger equations [5, 6, 7]

and lattice simulations [1] are two main methods. Dyson-Schwinger equation was used in

analytical calculation of spectra of Quantum electro dynamics (QED), and applied to other

fields. The lattice approach to quantum field theory shows evidence that gauge theory is the

fundamental tool, and that exchange of gauge gluons can confine quarks within subnuclear matter. In comparison to electrons or muons which have Z2 symmetry (1, -1), presence of three quark system N ++  uuu suggested quarks have Z3 symmetry which is called color symmetry (red, green, blue), but experimentally the symmetry is not detected.

.

In the minimal case of electromagnetism Z2 and gauge group U (2)[24], fermions which take values in the space M2  C2, where Mn is a n × n dimensional matrix, the Maxwell

action is given by

and the Dirac action is defined by a set of vectors e~a on S2 that satisfy e~ax~b - Ccbax~c, where Cabc = r-1abc.
Dual to the basis e~a are components ~a of the Maurer-Cartan form:

dx~a = Cbacx~b~c, ~a = cabcx~bdx~c - iAx~a.

Dirac proposed that the 1-form A contains the potential of Monopole[60, 61] of unit magnetic charge and F = dA.

Schwinger [7, 8] showed that there could exist a conserved divergenceless electromagnetic stress tensor, which guarantees stability and covariance of the theory. He considered spherically symmetric charge distribution of total charge e at rest,

Presence of Poincare´ stresses to explain the electromagnetic mass of an electron me, the inertial mass mp and the effective mass M = me + mp, that allow parametrization
M c2 = mec2 + mpc2 = mec2(1 + (1 + h)/3) = mec2(4/3 + h/3).

where parameter h = -1 yields electrostatic mass m(2), and the parameter h = 0 yields electrodynamic mass m(1) was proposed by Jackson [9]. The arbitraliness of the gauge fixing condition is discussed by [11, 12, 13, 14].
The standard model with Higgs mechanism [57] predicts that three of the original four SU (2) × U (1) gauge bosons become massive and one, corresponding to the photons, remains massless. Although Schwinger did not suppose stress tensors of non electromagnetic origin, gluons could play a role [9], since three quarks can have electromagnetic charge and affect charged particles.
Experimentally, Dirac's magnetic monopoles [89] are not observed, but 't Hooft [92] and Polyakov [96, 97] showed in the Yang-Mills field theory a string-like topological singularity can appear.
In section 2, we explain the gluon degrees of freedom and its symmetries in the YangMills theory. When one fixes the gauge symmetry of gluons in 4-dimensional Yang-Mills field theory, it is necessary to include ghosts to compensate unphysical degrees of reedom of gluons. Taking eigenstates of ghost number, one can formulate BRST symmetry.
The experimental detection of Higgs boson which appear by spontaneous symmetry breaking of the vacuum pushed investigation of the structure of the vacuum. In section 3, we explain the Gribov ambiguity that appears in the gluon propagator, and incorporation of instanton and sphalerons in QCD, using quaternion bases H, and embedding S3 × R topology in R4 minkowski space.
In section 4, we present a few formulations of hadron dynamics with additional dimension which corresponds to chiral symmetry or symmetry under Dirac's 5 operator. The first formulation consists of light-front holographic QCD (LFHQCD) by Brodsky and collaborators[109, 106] which is based on de Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan's anti de Sitter space approach [107]. The second formulation is based on non-commutative geometry developed by Connes and colaborators[17]. Non-commutative geometry is a set of tools to analyse broad range of objects that cannot be treated by classical methods [126]. Non-commutative algebra appears when one incorporates Hamilton's quaternion H in the orthogonal bases of the Hilbert space[19, 20]. Elements of H consist of I, i, j, k which satisfy

ij = k, jk = i, ki = j ji = -k, kj = -i, ik = -j

In the SL(2, C) representation, we can set

I=

0i i0

.

and

A = Ia + ib + jc + kd =

a + id -c + ib c + ib a - id

and A = Ia - ib - jc - kd.
We define a + id =  and c + ib = , ,   C, and express

A=

 -¯  ¯

, A =

¯ - ¯ 

.

From algebra of complex numbers and quaternions, one can construct Clifford algebra [20] in quadratic spaces. In section 5, we explain Clifford Algebra on the manifold of S3 and embed S3 × S1 topology to complex projective space CP3.
Discussion on symmetry violation and topological approach in other physical phenom-
ena is given in section6.

2. Gluons and BRST Symmetry of Yang-Mills Field

In Hamiltonian formulation of Yang-Mills field [37], lagrangian of QCD in the first order

is written as

L

Fik = kAi - iAk + g[Ai, Ak].

(2)

The generator Ak is decomposed in longitudinal and transverse comoponents

Ak = ALk + ATk

where kATk = 0 and

ALk = kB(x),

B(x)

When the transverse component EkT (x) is defined as kQ(x), the constraint on the longitudinal component is written as

Q - g[Ak, kQ] - g[Ak, EkT ] = 0.

In the gauge A0 = 0, three dimensional expression of Fij becomes

Fik = kAi - iAk + g[Ai, Ak].

Madore[24] defined orthogonal moving frame , whose metric satisfy

g(  ) = g

and structure equations of the torsion form  and curvature form  defined as

satisfy Bianchi identity:

d +    =   

d +    -    = 0

The vacuum Yang-Mills equations DF  = 0 where

F

satisfies the gauge transformation relations F  = g-1F g. If the gauge group is abelian, the equatio is the Maxwell equation.
Quarks and gluons have SU (3) color degrees of freedom, but these degrees of freedom are not observed experimentally and models of color confinement were proposed. Functionals of the QCD green function are given by Lagrangian L describing quarks and gluons, gauge-fixing Lagrangian LF ix and Faddeev-Popov ghost Lagrangian LGhost.
Faddeev-Popov ghosts are unphysical fields that compensate unphysical gluon degrees
of freedom [44, 35, 10, 38, 36].

where  is the gauge parameter. The covariant derivative of  is with color indices k, i and SU (3) color generator tC,

(D)k = [kl - igAC (tC )kl]()k.

Henneaux and Teitelboim [38] defined the phase space P and smooth phase space function C(P ). One restricts P a surface  and functions that vanish on  form an ideal in C(P ) which is denoted as N .
The local Lagrangian L and action on variables yi are defined by

S[y(t)] = t2 L(yi, yi, · · · y(k)i )dt

where y(k)i = dkyi/dtk, Gauge transformations of arbitrary parameter  are

yi = SAiA

S

and Noether's identity is

Kugo and Ojima [43, 44] pointed out that the QCD Lagrangian is invariant under the BRS transformation, and the gauge fields Aµa(x), the auxiliary field Ba(x), the covariant derivative of the ghost field Dµc(x) , anti-ghost field c¯(x) necessarily have massless asymptotic fields which form the BRS-quartet. The physical space Vphys = |phys is specified as the one that satisfies the condition QB|phys = 0, where

QB =

and (F × G)a = fabcF bGc. The Noether current[38] corresponding to the conservation of the color symmetry is

gJµa =  Fµ a + {QB, Dµc¯},

where the ambiguity by divergence of antisymmetric tensor shuld be understood, and this ambiguity is utilised so that massless contribution may be eliminated for the charge QB to be well defined [77, 78]. Denoting g(Aµ × c¯)  uabµ¯b, one obtains A has a vanishing asymptotic value and

where T means Dyson's time-ordering product operations that appear in perturbative
Schroedinger functional approach[5]. Kugo and Ojima[44] modified the Noether current for color charge Qa such that

gJµ a = gJµ -  Fµ a = {QB, Dµc¯}a

8

Furui, Sadataka

and the condition for the massless component in the current {QB, Dµc¯} is absent is ab + uba = 0.
In Landau gauge, Gribov region  is specified by the variation with respect to g = e

||Ag||2 = -2 A| + D|

 = {A| - D  0, A = 0}

(7)

We defined lattice link operator Uxµ = eAx,µ , where Ax,µ = -Ax,µ is the SU (3) Lie algebra operator, and gauge transformation was chosen as
eAgx,µ = gx eAx,µ gx+µ
Landau gauge was realized by choosing g = e and minimizing
||Ag||2 = T rAgx,µAgx,µ

The lattice covariant derivative Dµ(A) = µ + Ad(Aµ) in SU(3) simulation is given in [77].
Zwanziger[52, 53] developed a globally correct gauge fixing procedure. He showed in the of minimal Landau or Coulomb gauge lattice simulation, gluon propagator is infrared vanishing
The Faddeev-Popov determinant for gauge fixed fields A, which are hermitian Lie algebra gauge fields is

F P (A) = -iDi(A) = -i(i + iadAi)

where (adX)Y = [X, Y ]. In Coulomb gauge iAi = 0, one considers M  S3 and

I(g; A) = T r({[g]Ai}2) = T r({Ai + ig-1ig}2).

The Gribov region  is defined as the set of transverse gauge fields for which F P (A) is positive. By gauge transformation, a trajectory of minimum points of F P (A) could bifurcate into two trajectories of minimum points [66]
Zwanziger [67] defined fundamental modular region  specified by

and the ghost propagator which is an inverse of the Faddeev-Popov operator D[39] as

G(x - y)ab =

1 -Dµ(A)

.

He defined lattice gauge covariant derivative Dµab that operates on link variable Uµ(x) whose relation to Aaµ(x) is

Aaµ(x)ta

[Uµ(x)

Uµ (x)]traceless .

In the `t Hooft double line representation [123], quarks are described by single line, glu-

ons and ghosts are described by double line. The Faddeev-Popov tensor gives the ghost

propagator

Gµ (x - y)ab =

DµacDbd

The ghost number correspods to the number of branching of a gluon in double line expressions.
Baulieu and Zwanziger [74] replaced the gauge fixing in 4 dimensional space to 5dimensional formulation and succeeded in restricting 4 dimensional gluon field in the Gribov region and decoupling ghost fields. Zwanziger[75] derived an equation similar to KugoOjima confinement equation.
Infrared vanishing of the gluon propagator was consistent with the renormalizable theory of 't Hooft [95].
Although the BRST symmetry is violated on lattice simulations[73], samples that we took close to the fundamental moduler region showed u  -0.7 in quenched simulation [78, 80], and u  -1 in unquenched Kogut-Susskind fermion configurations produced by the MILC collaboration [48, 49].
Verification of Kugo-Ojima coefficient using Dyson-Schwinger equation was investigated by Alkofer et al. [69, 70, 71].
Modern formulation of the Faddeev-Popov S-matrix elements of Yang-Mills field theory in Landau gauge is

in|out  expiS[B][B]x(µBµ(x))dB(x) xD(x)

where the gauge group is expressed as Bµ  Bµ = Bµ-1 + -1µ-1

10

Furui, Sadataka

and the factor x(µBµ(x)) symbolyzes that integral is performed over transverse fields, and [B] is chosen such that

[B] x(µBµ(x))d = const

holds. The analysis was extended from the real Minkowski space to the complex Riemann space in [27].

3. The Gribov Copy Problem and the Structure of Vacuum

Serious ambiguities in Coulomb or Landau gauge fixed Faddeev-Popov Yang-Mills field equation were studied in connection with BRS transformation [40, 41]. Gribov ambiguity and gauge fixing procedures are investigated in [42]. Spontaneous symmetry breaking of the gauge theory and prediction of a scalar bosons [57, 58, 59] motivated studies of topology of Higgs field[93].
Polyakov [97] proposed instanton in non abelian gauge theory, and Dashen, Hasslacher and Neveu[54] and Yaffe[55] proposed sphalerons, which in S3 × R described by

gauge theory. They considered xµ  R4, r2 = x2µ and nµ = xµ/r and redefined time t through r = Rexp(t/R) such that

dx2µ = exp(2t/R)(dt2 + R2dn2µ)
where dn2µ represents the metric of a unit sphere of volume 22, and coordinates xµ are represented by quaternions [26, 23, 20, 21] mu = (I, i ) and anti-quaternion ¯mu = (I, -i ) as
x = xµµ = x¯, i = -¯i = ii, 4 = ¯4 = 1.
Choosing R = 1 and defining dreibein on S3, using `t Hooft symbols  and ¯[94]

µ¯ -  ¯µ = 2iµa a ¯µ - ¯ µ = 2i¯µa a
where a = 1, 2, 3 and µ,  run from 1 to 4, as

eaµ = µa n .
In the absence of fermions, the  parameter is the relevant quantum number to connect the wave functionals in te various vacua. van Baal and Cutkosky [63] verified the tunnelling from the A = 0 vacuum to the vacua that have Chern-Simons number one or minus one in SU (2) gauge.
S3 ×R is isomorphic to torus T 4 = C4/G where G is a discrete subgroup of a complex manifold W .

induces anomalies due to singularities of Feynman integral, but they can be cancelled to make the theory renormalizable [91]. The chiral flavor SU (N )LSU (N )RU (1) currents

`t Hooft linked isospin to one of SO(3) subgroups of SO(4)[94]. Dosch, de Te´ramond and Brodsky [110] showed that if one embeds 4-dimensional Eu-
clidean space in 5-dimensional anti-de Sitter space[113, 114] by adopting the AdS/CFT corespondence [98], and choosing the light-front holographic coordinate, one can construct QCD theory without ghost and get insight to the color confinement problem.
The supersymmetry of the low energy hadron spectra was proposed in [107, 108], and applied in the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC), which was successful in explaining supersymmetric hadron spectroscopy [99, 105] and infrared suppression of gluon propagators. In light-front quantum field theory, Pauli-Lubanski pseudovector

where P 2 = m2 and W 2 are Casimir operators, and one can use light-front gauge in all
Lorentz frames avoiding redundant gauge degrees of freedom characteristic of covariant
gauges[103].
Separation of quark spin degrees of freedom and gluon spin degrees of freedom of a
nucleon and Lorentz symmetry in dynamics similar to light front dynamics is discussed in [111, 112]. He defined energy momentum of a nucleon T µ = Tqµ + Tgµ and total momentum operator P µ = d3xT 0µ The helicity operator h = J · P^ where p^ = p/|p| coincides with W µsµ, where sµ = (|p|/M, p0p^/M ).
The choice of light-front time  = t + z/c and light-cone coordinates ± = (0 ± 3)/ 2, and the transverse component  = (1, 2) allows Lorentz transformation proper conformal analysis.

p|Pqµ,g|p = Aq,g(µ)pµp + Bq,g(µ)gµ0/(2p0).

The angular momentum density M µ = T µx - T µx consists of quark and gluon

parts

Mqµ,g  = Tqµ,g x - Tqµ,gx .

Gluon contribution to the angular momentum is the Poynting vector Jg = d3xE × B. In non-commutative geometry, one considers n-dimensional Euclidean vector space
Cn with inner product, and interactions are descibed by n × n complex matrices Mn. Let V be a smooth compact oriented real manifold without boundary of dimension m, and
C(V ) be the commutative associative algebra of smooth real-valued function on V . Let i be the natural basis of vectors on the space Rn and linear combination of X = Xii with Xi  C(Rn) modules and
(Rn) = n1 C(Rn).

Maxwell-Dirac action[24] can be defined by the algebra A = C(V )  Mn where Mn is the matrix algebra.

One lets Cn be the n-dimensional Euclidean vector space with the standard inner product, and for an integer m < n write Cn = Cm Cn-m, and decompose Mn as a direct sum Mn = Mn+  Mn-. The Mn+ are even operators that satisfy Mn+ = Mm × Mn-m  Mn.

The model is called Connes-Lott [15] model. Application of noncommutative geometry to SU (3) × SU (2) × U (1) symmetric stan-
dard model was done by Connes and Lott [15], and Chamseddine and Connes [17, 86]. Noncommutative geometry appears when one incorporates quaternion in analysis, since for quaternions p and q, results of multiplication p · q and q · p differes, if p = q. This additional degrees of freedom, or extra dimension was used to cover chiral-even and chiral-odd manifolds.
The Lagrangian they took consists of

· The pure gauge boson part LG,

· The fermion kinetic term Lf ,

· Kinetic terms for Higgs fields L,

· The Yukawa couplingof Higgs fields with fermion LY ,

· The Higgs self-interaction LV .
For a compact Riemannian spin manifold M and a self-adjoint Dirac operator D = M acting in the Hilbert space h of L2 spinors on the manifold M , Connes et al constructed Yang-Mills action functional, expressed as a triple (A, h, D), where A is the von Neumann algebra on M:
A = C(M )  AF
where AF = C + H + M3(C). Using a spectral geometry on AF denoted as (HF , DF ), the Hamiltonian and the Dirac operator are expressed as

H = L2(M, S)  HF , D = iµµM  1 + 5  DF
where Mµ means derivative on the manifold M . They developed a theory of manifold in noncommutative geometry, using Hamiltonian
algebra of quaternions H which is characterised by an element x  M2(C) that satisfies by g  U (2) and J such that JgJ-1 = g¯, the relation JxJ-1 = x¯.

Orthogonal transformations in Euclidean En space, O(n) denotes the real orthogonal transformation, which is the transitive group on the unit (n - 1) sphere Sn-1. If x0  Sn-1 is fixed, subgroup leaving x0 fixed is orthogonal group On-1, and we consider

where U  SU (2) is a mapping from R3 to S3. In the case of SU (3), using complex variables we consider GL(2, C) transformation.

5. Clifford Algebra on the Manifold of S1 × S3

In Clifford algebra, finite dimensional division algebra R, C and H can be treated equivalently. Quaternions satisfy the division axiom - that the product of two factprs cannot vanish without either factor vanishing. We consider the Lorentz transformations of a quaternion q  q
q = Iq0 + iq1 + jq2 + kq3
that satisfy q02 - q12 - q22 - q32 invariant. A transformation for complex numbers

z

=

az + b cz + d

which is general linear transformation is too general. We first choose q = uv-1, u, v  H [26].
With any quaternion 

q = u-1v-1 = u(v)-1

To transform q to q, u, v are transformed as

u = au + bv, v = cu + dv

where a, b, c, d are arbitrary quaternions, and q = uv-1 By the above transformations

q = (au + bv)(cu + dv)-1 = (au + bv)v-1v(cu + dv)-1

= (au + bv)v-1[(cu + dv)v-1]-1 = (aq + b)(cq + d)-1.

(9)

Alternatively when q = -1 q = (qa + b)-1(qc + d).

The transformation of previous assignment q = uv-1 gives

q = a(q + a-1b)[c(q + c-1d)]-1 = a(q + a-1b)(q + c-1d)-1c-1.

which yields a necessary condition a-1b = c-1d The transformation q~ = (aq + b)(cq + d)-1 = u~v~-1 and q~ = q yields

ab + bd = 0, ca + dc = 0

aa + bc = cb + dd = m

In order to make q, q and q~ satisfy Lorentz group relations,

Q1 = uv¯, Q2 = uu¯, Q3 = vv¯

are defined, and in Q1, u, v are replaced by u, v, which yields u(v¯) = u¯v¯ = Q1¯

Put Q1 = IX0 + iX1 + jX2 + kX3, where X0, X1, X2, X3  R, and Q2 = X4 - X5, Q3 = X4 + X5

three Qs define six real numbers X0, X1, X2, X3, X4, X5. If u, v are replaced by u, v, all X are multiplied by ¯ and their ratios are not changed.
From relations Q1Q¯1 = uv¯vu¯ = uQ3u¯ = Q2Q3. Hence
X02 + X12 + X22 + X33 = X42 - X52.
By choosing q~, one can define new X's and to make the transformations satisfy the Lorentz group, one can impose restictions of choosing planes X0 = 0, X5 = 0, which is equivalent to
uv¯ + vu¯ = 0, uu¯ + vv¯ = 0.
The transformation that satisfy Lorentz group is

q = (aq ± µa)(-µa¯q ± a)-1.

Four quantities  = X/X5 and  = X/X0 ( = 1, 2, 3, 4) transform as vectors in space-time, and we choose  for analysis. A choice u = q, v = 1 gives

The chiral symmetry in complex projective space CPN-1 was studied also by d'Adda
et al. [121, 122]. They regarded quarks as Goldstone bosons and considered spontaneous symmetry breaking of SU (N ) to SU (N - 1)  U (1) due to instantons. Laglangian of N 2 - 1 scalar fields is defined as

L

=

1 2

T

rµ

-

T rP ()

where P () is some polynomials[123]. Choosing N dimensional column vector of unit length zz = 1,  = g0-1[N 1/2zz - N -1/2I], where g0 is a parameter derived from P ().
After proper normalization, and taking currents in the system as

A Closer Look at Gluons

the Lagrangian becomes L = µzµz - g02N -1jµjµ
with the constraint zz = N/g02. When N = 4, the dimension of the real Goldstone fields becomes
dimSU (4) - dimU (4 - 1) = 15 - (4 - 1)2 = 6

which agrees with the dimension of X fields. Kodaira showed in projective space P3, the cohomology groups of P3 with coefficients
in (C): H1(P3, C) = 0[28] and one can define 2 algebraic curves on two dimensional
surface. In projective space, zero-mode Dirac wave function contains a parameter that fixes
the scale of the system. Kodaira defined a compex manifold W as a domain C2 - (0, 0), and a surface S home-
omorphic to S1 × S3 and Zt denotes an infinite cyclic group generated by a linea transformation (z1, z2)  (tz1, tz2) where 0 < |t| < 1 and St = W/Zt, and S3 is defined by |z1|2 + |z2|2 = 1. He prooved existence of local complex analytical coordinates (wj, zj ) which define
 = /zj , eczj dwj = mjkeczk dwk
on Uj  Uk, where  is 0 at wk = 0, and not zero elsewhere, c is a constant, and wj is a holomorphic function of wk independent of zj,

wj = fjk(wk)
on Uj  Uk. Embedding S1 × S3 on which quarterion H operates on S3 in R4 and a parameter
for the Laplace transform operates on S1 can be compared with conventional embedding S3 × R in R4, since local complex analytic coordinates (wj, zj) defined respectively on Uj such that the sheaf over S is denoted as 
Unitary transformation U n operating in complex n-space is also transitive on the unit (2n - 1) sphere, and we consider
S2n-1 = U (n)/U (n - 1)

and n = 2. Using quaternion variables, we can consider U (1, H) as the quotient group. The group SU (2) is a U (1)-bundle over S2 and the projection of the bundle onto its
base space is called the Hopf fibration[24]. We extend the theory to bundles over S3 =
O(4)/O(3). Hopf manifold is not algebraic manifold, but the Lie group GL(2, C) can
operate on wj. One can choose two orbits corresponding to plus or minus c. On Hopf surface W = C2 - {0}, one defines automorphisms

gt : (z1, .z2)  (z1 + tz2, z2), 0 < || < 1, t  C. Gt = {gtm|m  Z} is automorphic and do not have fixed points, since
gt :m (z1, .z2)  (mz1 + mm-1tz2, mz2).

Mt = C/Gt is also a Hopf surface. Complex structure of M0 and Mt, t not zero, are

different. One dimensional algebraic manifold is called an algebraic curve. On Mt, t = 0,

6. Discussion and Conclusion

We reviewed properties of Yang-Mills action, which is described by functions F  = g-1F g,

and Maxwell equation appears when g = 1. When spinors on manifolds are introduced and

the gauge transformation is extended to g = U (1) × SU (2) × U (3), the standard model of hadrons described by quarks and gluons was embedded in R4 space.

In QED, only transverse components of photons interact with leptons, and Gupta-

Bleuler prescription[76] to cancel non-physical degrees of freedom was proposed. In QCD,

due to non-linearity of quark-gluon interactions, cancellation of non-physical degrees of

freedom of gluons was performed by Faddeev-Popov ghosts. The Faddeev-Popov proce-

dure contained the Gribov copy problem, which shows that the gauge fixing can not be

done uniquely. Restricting gauge orbits to the fundamental modular region and models sat-

isfying BRST symmetry was proposed, and by Dyson-Schwinger approach and by lattice

simulation, suppression of the gluon propagator and enhancement of the ghost propagator

in infrared region was confirmed in SU (3) color symmetry. The requirement of ghost is related to the chiral symmetry or 5 symmetry of Dirac

fermions. Constructing renormalizable QCD without ghosts was tried by several re-

searchers, by adding an extra dimension in the Hilbert space.

In light front holographic QCD (LFHQCD), Pauli-Lubanski relativistic spin approach

was adopted and subtraction of non-physical gauge freedom outside proper light-cone was

performed. In the approach of non-commutative geometry, covering of manifolds with

positive chirarity and manifolds with negative chirality was performed using quaternion

vectors.

If the divergent electromagnetic self energy is expressed as (m2)e =

m2

3e2 2

log(2

/m2),

where

and

(

-2 -2 -q 2

),

electro magnetic mass difference of proton and neutron mass would become[117]

(M 2)proton - (M 2)neutron = -1.2934MeV.

Nucleons have spin 3/2  resonance states, and extension of color SU (3) to SU (6)color,spin was tried to explain hadron spectroscopy [118] but the model was unsuccessful.
In the Nahm-ADHM formalism in which quaternion vectors on S3 was adopted, energy of zero momentum modes were investigated to fix the scale of glueball mass[66, 72].
Jaffe [119] proposed combination of flavor SU (3) (no charm contribution) and spin SU (2) produces flavor singet stable dihyperon states. Incorpolation of quark and gluon degrees of freedom in deuteron form factor was done in [101]. Prediction of tetraquark state spectroscopy in LFHQCD is given in [106].
In nature, the chiral symmetry and self-adjoint operations play important roles and the quternion H is a useful tool, which clarifys the role of an extra dimension and conformal transformations. Non-linearity and solitonic waves in various domains are also important[127].
