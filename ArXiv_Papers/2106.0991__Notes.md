## Abstract

We compute the heat generated by nanomagnets subjected to an alternating magnetic field (AMF) and study its transfer to the hosting medium and environment. For the first task, we compute the heat generated by the nanomagnets (or the specific absorption rate $\mathfrak{S}$) using the ac susceptibility in the linear regime. For the second task, the loss of heat to the environment is modeled with the help of a balance (macroscopic) equation based on Newton's law of cooling. This equation is solved both numerically and analytically for a generic ferrofluid and the analytical solution renders a very good approximation to the general balance equation. Applying this formalism to maghemite and magnetite ferrofluids and using the corresponding experimental data, we investigate the effects of AMF frequency and amplitude on the temperature elevation during its temporal evolution. Finally, upon fitting our results to the available experimental data, we discuss the behavior of Newton's heat transfer coefficient in terms of the AMF amplitude and frequency. These results could trigger experimental investigations of this coefficient which characterizes the rate of heating in a ferrofluid, with the aim to build more refined models for the mechanisms of heat generation and its diffusion in ferrofluids used in magnetic hyperthermia.
