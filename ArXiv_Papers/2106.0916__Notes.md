## Abstract

The paper studies categories of definable subassignments with some category equivalences to semi-algebraic and constructible subsets of arc spaces of algebraic varieties. These materials allow us to compare the motivic measure of Cluckers-Loeser and the one of Denef-Loeser in certain classes of definable subassignments.
