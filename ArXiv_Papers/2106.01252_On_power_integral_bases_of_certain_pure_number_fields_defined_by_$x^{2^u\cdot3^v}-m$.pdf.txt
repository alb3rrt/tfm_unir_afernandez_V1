Abstract. Let K = Q() be a pure number field generated by a complex root  of a monic irreducible polynomial F(x) = x2u·3v - m, with m ±1 a square free rational integer, u, and v two positive integers. In this paper, we study the monogenity of K. The case u = 0 or v = 0 has been previously studied. We prove that if m 1 (mod 4) and m ±1 (mod 9), then K is monogenic. But if m  1 (mod 4) or m  1 (mod 9), then K is not monogenic. Some illustrating examples are given too.

1. Introduction

Let K = Q() be a number field generated by a complex root  of a monic

irreducible polynomial F(x)  Z[x] and ZK its ring of integers. It is well know that the ring ZK is a free Z-module of rank n = [K : Q]. Thus the Abelian group ZK/Z[] is finite. Its cardinal order is called the index of Z[], and denoted (ZK : Z[]). The ring ZK is said to have a power integral basis if it has a Z-basis (1, , · · · , n-1) for some   ZK. This means that ZK is mono-generated as a ring, with a single generator .

In such a case, the field K is said to be monogenic and not monogenic otherwise. The

problem of testing the monogenity of number fields and the construction of power

integral bases has been intensively studied these last fourth decades, mainly by

Gaa´l, Nakahara, Pohst, and their research teams (see for instance [2, 17, 18, 19, 28]).

In [7], El Fadil gave conditions for the existence of power integral bases of pure

cubic fields in terms of the index form equation. In [16], Funakura, calculated

integral bases and studied the monogenity of pure quartic fields. In [20], Gaa´l and

Remete,

calculated

for 1 < m < 107 and m  2, 3 (mod 4). In [1], Ahmad, Nakahara, and Husnine

proved that if m  2, 3 (mod 4) and m ±1 (mod 9), then the sextic number field

generated

by

is

monogenic.

They also showed

that if

1 (mod 4) and

m

(mod 9),

then

the

In [8], based on prime ideal factorization, El Fadil showed that if m  1 (mod 4)

or m

1

(mod

9),

then

the

number

field

Hameed and Nakahara proved that if m  1 (mod 4), then the octic number field

generated by m1/8 is not monogenic, but if m  2, 3 (mod 4), then it is monogenic

([23]). In [21], by applying the explicit form of the index equation, Gaa´l and Remete

where 3  n  9. In [3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], based on Newoton polygon techniques, it

was studied the monogenity of some pure number fields. While Gaa´l and Remete's

techniques are based on the index calculation, Nakahara's methods are based on the

existence of power relative integral bases of some special sub-fields. The goal of this paper is to study the monogenity of pure number fields defined by x2u·3v - m, where

m 1 is a square free integer, u, and v are two natural integers. The case u = 0 or

v = 0 has been studied in [3], the case v = 0 has been studied by Hameed, Nakahara,

and Husnine in [24]. Also the case u = 1 has been studied by El Fadil in [12].

2. Main results
Let K be the number field defined by a complex root  of a monic irreducible polynomial F(x) = x2u·3v - m, with m ±1 a square free rational integer, u and v two positive integers.
Theorem 2.1. If m 1 (mod 4) and m ±1 (mod 9), then Z[] is the ring of integers of K; K is monogenic and  generates a power integral basis.
Theorem 2.2. If m  1 (mod 4) or m  1 (mod 9), then K is not monogenic.
Corollary 2.3. Let K be the number field defined by a complex root  of a monic irreducible polynomial F(x) = x2u·3v - ak, with a ±1 a square free rational integer, u and v two positive integers, and k a positive integer coprime to 6.
(1) If a 1 (mod 4) and m ±1 (mod 9), then K is monogenic. (2) If a  1 (mod a) or a  1 (mod 9), then K is not monogenic.

3. Preliminaries

Let K = Q() be a number field generated by a complex root  of a monic irre-

ducible polynomial F(x)  Z[x], ZK its ring of integers, and ind() = (ZK : Z[]) the

index of Z[] in ZK. For a rational prime integer p, if p does not divide (ZK : Z[]),

then a well known theorem of Dedekind says that the factorization of pZK can be de-

rived directly from the factorization of F(x) in Fp[x]. Namely, pZK =

r i=0

plii ,

where

every pi = pZK + i()ZK and F(x) =

r i=1

i(x)li

modulo

p

is

the

factorization

of

F(x)

into powers of monic irreducible coprime polynomials of Fp[x]. So, f (pi) = deg(i)

is the residue degree of pi (see [26, Chapter I, Proposition 8.3]). In order to apply this theorem in an effective way, one needs a criterion to test whether p divides or

not the index (ZK : Z[]). In 1878, Dedekind proved the well known Dedekind's

criterion (see [5, Theorem 6.1.4]). When Dedekind's criterion fails, that is, p divides

the index (ZK : Z[]) for every primitive element   ZK of K, then it is not possible

to obtain the prime ideal factorization of pZK by applying Dedekind's theorem. In

1928, Ore developed an alternative approach for obtaining the index (ZK : Z[]), the

absolute discriminant, and the prime ideal factorization of the rational primes in a

number field K by using Newton polygons (see [25, 27]). We start by recalling some

fundamental facts about Newton polygons applied in algebraic number theory. For

3

more details, we refer to [14, 15, 22]. For any prime integer p and for any monic

polynomial





Z[x]

whose

reduction

is

irreducible

in

Fp[x],

let

F

be

the

field

Fp[x] .
()

For any monic polynomial F(x)  Z[x], upon the Euclidean division by successive

powers of , we expand F(x) as F(x) =

l i=0

ai(x)(x)i,

called

the

-expansion

of

F(x)

(for every i, deg(ai(x)) < deg()). The -Newton polygon of F(x) with respect to p,

is the lower boundary convex envelope of the set of points {(i, p(ai(x))), ai(x) 0}

in the Euclidean plane, which is denoted by N(F). Let S1, S2, . . . , St be the sides of

N(F). For every side S of N(F), the length of S, denoted l(S), is the length of its

projection to the x-axis, its height, denoted H(S), is the length of its projection to the

y-axis. Let  = H(S)/l(S), then - is the slope of S. If  0, then  = h/e with e and

h two positive coprime integer. Notice that e = l(S)/d, called the ramification index

of S and h = H(S)/d, where d =gcd(l(S), H(S)) is called the degree of S. Thus N(F)

is the join of its differente sides ordered by increasing slopes, which we can express

by N(F) = S1 + S2 + · · · + St. The principal -Newton polygon of F(x) , denoted by N+(F), is the part of the polygon N(F), which is determined by all sides of negative slopes of N(F). For every side S of N+(F), with initial point (s, us) and length l, and

for every i = 0, . . . , l, we attach the following residue coefficient ci  F as follows:

 

0,



ci

=

 

as+i(x)

 

pus+i

(mod (p, (x))),

if (s + i, us+i) lies strictly above S, if (s + i, us+i) lies on S.

where (p, (x)) is the maximal ideal of Z[x] generated by p and . Let  = -h/e be the slope of S, where h and e are two positive coprime integers. Then d = l/e is the degree of S. Notice that, the points with integer coordinates lying on S are exactly (s, us), (s + e, us - h), · · · , (s + de, us - dh). Thus, if i is not a multiple of e, then (s+i, us+i) does not lie on S, and so ci = 0. Let FS(y) = td yd+td-1yd-1+· · ·+t1y+t0  F[y], called the residual polynomial of F(x) associated to the side S, where for every
i = 0, . . . , d, ti = cie.

Remark. (1) Notice that, since (s, us) and (s + l, us+l) lie on S, tdt0 0 in F, and so deg(FS) = d and FS(0) 0.
(2) Notice also that if (as(x)) = 0,  = 0, and  = x, then F = Fp and for every i = 0, . . . , l, ci = as+i (mod p). Thus this notion of residual coefficient generalizes the reduction modulo a maximal ideal and FS(y)  Fp[y] coincides with the reduction of F(x) modulo the maximal ideal (p).

Let N+(F) = S1 + · · · + St be the principal -Newton polygon of F with respect to p. We say that F(x) is a -regular polynomial with respect to p, if for every

i = 1, . . . , t, FSi(y) is square free in F[y]. We say that F is a p-regular polynomial if

F is a i-regular polynomial with respect to p for every i = 1, . . . , r, for some monic

polynomials 1, . . . , r with F(x) =

r i=1

ili

is

the

factorization

of

F(x)

in

Fp[x].

The theorem of Ore plays a key role for proving our main theorems: Let   Z[x] be a monic polynomial, with (x) irreducible in Fp[x]. As defined

4

HAMID BEN YAKKOU, LHOUSSAIN EL FADIL, AND AHMED NAJIM

in [15, Def. 1.3], the -index of F(x), denoted ind(F), is deg() times the number of points with natural integer coordinates that lie below or on the polygon N+(F),

strictly above the horizontal axis, and strictly beyond the vertical axis (see Figure 1).

Now assume that F(x) =

r i=1

ili

is

the

factorization

of

F(x)

in

Fp[x],

are monic polynomials lying in Z[x] and 1, . . . , r are pairwise coprime irreducible

polynomials over Fp. For every i = 1, . . . , r, let N+i(F) = Si1 + · · · + Siri be the principal

part of the i-Newton polygon of F with respect to p. For every j = 1, . . . , ri, let

FSij(y) =

si j s=1

ai js i js

(

y)

be

the

factorization

of

FSij (y)

into powers of monic irreducible

polynomials of Fi[y]. Then we have the following theorem of Ore (see [15, Theorem

1.7 and Theorem 1.9], [14, Theorem 3.9], and [25]):

Theorem 3.1. (Theorem of Ore)

The equality holds if F(x) is p-regular. (2) If F(x) is p-regular, then

r ri sij

pZK =

i=1 j=1 s=1

where eij is the ramification index of the side Sij and fijs = deg(i) × deg(ijs) is the residue degree of pijs over p for every i = 1, . . . , r, j = 1, . . . , ri, and s = 1, . . . , sij.

Corollary 3.2. Under the assumptions above Theorem 3.1, if for every i = 1, . . . , r, li = 1 or Ni(F) = Si has a single side of height 1, then p((ZK : Z[])) = 0.

The following lemma allows to evaluate the p-adic valuation of the binomial

coefficient

pr j

. Its proof will appear in [4].

Lemma 3.3. Let p be a rational prime integer and r be a positive integer. Then p

pr j

=

r - p( j) for any integer j = 1, . . . , pr - 1.

In [22], Gua`rdia, Montes, and Nart introduced the notion of -admissible ex-

pansion used in order to treat some special cases when the -expansion is hard to

calculate. Let

if (i, ui ) lies above N, if (i, ui ) lies on N.

Likewise, for any side S of N+, we can define the residual polynomial atached to

S and denoted R(F)(y) (similar to the residual expansion). We say that the -expansion (1) is i of a vetex of N. For more details, we refer to

polynomial R(F)(y) from the -adic admissible if ci 0 for each abscissa [22].

Lemma 3.4. ([22, Lemma 1.12]) If a -expansion of F(x) is admissible, then N+ = N+(F) and ci = ci. In particular, for any side S of N+ we have R(F)(y) = R(F)(y) up to multiplication by a nonzero coefficient of F.

The following lemma allows to determine the -Newton polygon of F(x). Its proof will appear in [13].

Lemma 3.5. Let F(x) = xn - m  Z[x] be an irreducible polynomial and p a prime integer

which divides n and does not divide m. Let n = prt in Z with p does not divide t. Then

F(x)

=

Let

and





Z[x]

be

polynomial,

whose

modulo p divides F(x). Let us denote (xt - m) = (x)Q(x) + R(x). Then p(R)  1.

(1) If p(mp-1 - 1)  r, then N+(F) is the lower boundary of the convex envelope of the set of the points {(0, v)}  {(pj, r - j), j = 0, . . . , r}.

(2) If p(mp-1 - 1)  r + 1, then N+(F) is the lower boundary of the convex envelope of the set of the points {(0, V)}  {(pj, r - j), j = 0, . . . , r} for some integer V  r + 1.

4. Proofs of main results
Proof. of Theorem 2.1. Since (F) = ±(2u · 3v)2u·3vm2u·3v-1 is the discriminant of F, by the well-known formula linking (F), (ZK : Z[]) and dK; the discriminant of K, Z[] is integrally closed if and only if p does not divide (ZK : Z[]) for every rational prime integer p dividing 6 · m. Let p be a rational prime dividing m, then F(x)  2u·3v( mod p), where  = x. As m is a square free integer, the principal -Newton polygon with respect to p, N+(F) = S has a single side of height 1. Thus by Corollary 3.2, p((ZK : Z[])) = 0;

6

HAMID BEN YAKKOU, LHOUSSAIN EL FADIL, AND AHMED NAJIM

p does not divide (ZK : Z[]). For p = 2 and 2 does not divide m, let (x)  Z[x]
be a monic polynomial whose reduction is an irreducible factor F(x) in F2[x]. Since m  3 (mod 4), 2(m - 1) = 1, and so by Lemma 3.5, N+(F) = S has a single side of height 1. Thus by Corollary 3.2, 2((ZK : Z[])) = 0. Similarly for p = 3, since m ±1 (mod 9), 3(m2 - 1) = 1, and so by Lemma 3.5, N+(F) = S has a single side of height 1; Thus by Corollary 3.2, 3((ZK : Z[])) = 0.
For the proof of Theorem 2.2, we need the following Lemma, which is an immediate consequence of a theorem of Kummer.

Lemma 4.1. Let p be rational prime integer and K a number field. For every positive integer
f , let P f be the number of distinct prime ideals of ZK lying above p with residue degree f and N f the number of monic irreducible polynomials of Fp[x] of degree f . If P f > N f for some positive integer f , then p divides (ZK : Z[]) for every generator   ZK of K. When this occurs, we say that p is a common index divisor of K.

Proof. of Theorem 2.2.

+ x + 1)U(x)

in F2[x] for a monic polynomial U(x)  Z[x]. Let 2 = x - 1, 2 = x2 + x + 1, and v2 = 2(1 - m).
(a) If v2 = 2, then N+2(F) = S has a single side of degree d = 2. By using F(x) = (1U(x))2u + · · · + 1 - m, we have FS(y) = t2 y2 + ty + 1, where
t  1U(x) (mod 2, 2) si a nonzero element of F2. Since x3k - 1 is

separable over F2, 2 does not divide 1U(x) in F2[x], and so t is a nonzero element of F2. It follows FS(y) = (ty - x)(ty - x2) in F2[y]. Thus 2 provides 2 distinct prime ideals of ZK lying above 2 with residue
degree 2 each one. If u  2 and v2 = 3, then by Lemma 3.5 and Lemma 3.3, N+i(F) has two sides Si1 and Si2 joining the point (0, 3), (2u-1, 1), and (2u, 0) (see FIGURE 2). Thus Si1 is a side of degree 2 and Si2 is a side of degree 1 for every i = 1, 2. Since FS11(y) = y2 + y + 1 is irreducible over F1  F2 and FS22(y) is of degree 1. By Theorem 3.1, every i provides at least prime ideal pii of ZK associated to the side Sii, with
f11 =deg(1)·deg(FS11 = 1 · 2 = 2 and f22 =deg(2)·deg(FS22) = 2 · 1 = 2 are the residue degrees of p11 and p22. Thus there are at least 2 distinct prime ideals of ZK lying above 2 with residue degree 2 each one. As x2 + x + 1 is
the unique monic irreducible polynomial of degree 2 in F2[x], by Lemma
4.1, 2 divides i(K) and K is not monogenic.

(b) If u  2 and v2  4, then by Lemma 3.5 and Lemma 3.3, N+i(F) has at least 3 sides for which the last two sides Si1 and Si2 are of height 1 for
every i = 1, 2 (see FIGURE3). Thus, FS21(y) and FS22(y) are of degree 1. By Theorem 3.1, 2 provides at least two prime ideals p21 and p22 of ZK
lying above 2 with residue degree f2i =deg(2)·deg(FS2i = 2 each one. As x2 + x + 1 is the unique monic irreducible polynomial of degree 2 in F2[x],
by Lemma 4.1, 2 divides i(K) and K is not monogenic.

(2) If m  1 (mod 9), then F(x) = (x2u - 1)3v = ((x - 1)(x + 1)U(x))3v in F3[x] for a monic polynomial U(x)  F3[x]. Let 1 = x - 1, 2 = x + 1, and v3 = 3(1 - m). If v3  2, then by Lemma 3.5 and Lemma 3.3, N+i(F) has at least 2 sides of which the last two sides Si1 and Si2 are of height 1 each one for every i = 1, 2 (see FIGURE4 and FIGURE5). Thus FSij(y) is of degree 1 for every i, j = 1, 2. By Theorem 3.1, every i provides at least 2 prime ideals pij of ZK lying above 3 with residue degree fij =deg(i)·deg(FSij) = 1 for every i, j = 1, 2, and so there are at least 4 prime ideals of ZK lying above 3 with residue degree 1 each
one. As there is only 3 monic irreducible polynomial of degree 1 in F3[x], by
Lemma 4.1, 3 divides i(K) and K is not monogenic.

Proof. of Corllary 2.3.

Since gcd(k, 6) = 1, let (x, y)  Z2 be the unique solution of the equation k·x-2u·3v· y =

1 and 

=

. x
ay

Then 2u·3v

=

a, and so

g(x)

=

x2u·3v - a is the minimal polynomial of

 over Q,   ZK is a primitive element of K. Since a is square free, we can apply

Theorems 2.1 and 2.2.

5. Examples
Let K = Q() be the pure number fields generated by  a root of a monic irreducible polynomial F(x) = x -2u·3v -m with u and v are two positive integers.
(1) Let F(x) = x36 - 11664  Z[x]. Since 2(11664) = 5 and gcd(5, 18) = 1, by Corollary 2.3, K is monegenic and  generates a power integral basis.
(2) For F(x) = x36 - 37  Z[x], as 37  1 (mod 9), by Theorem 2.2, ZK is not monogenic.
(3) For F(x) = x12 - 13  Z[x],, since 2 = 2(13 - 1) = 2, neither Theorem 2.1 nor Theorem 2.2, can not give an answer about the monogenity of K. Let us
show that 2 is a common index divisor of K and so we conclude that K is not monogenic. First F(x) = (x - 1)4(x2 + x + 1)4 in F2[x]. For  = x2 + x + 1, F(x) = (x)6 +(9-6x)(x)5 -(25+5x)(x)4 +(18+24x)(x)3 -18x(x)2 -(4-4x)(x)-12 is the -expansion of F(x). Thus with respect to p = 2, N+(F) = S has a single side joining the points (0, 2) and (4, 0) such that FS(y) = (1+x)y2+xy+1 in F[y]. First by Theorem 3.1, 2 divides the index (ZK : Z[]). But why 2 divides the index (ZK : Z[]) for every generator   ZK of K? Since FS(y) = (y + 1)(y + x2) in F[y], by Theorem 3.1, there are at least 2 prime ideals of ZK lying above 2 with residue degree 2 each one. As x2 + x + 1 is the unique monic irreducible
polynomial over F2, by Lemma 4.1, 2 divides the index (ZK : Z[]) for every generator   ZK of K and thus K is not monogenic. (4) For F(x) = x12 - 17  Z[x], since 17  -1 (mod 9), neither Theorem 2.1 nor
Theorem 2.2, can not give an answer about the monogenity of K. Let us
show that 3 is a common index divisor of K and so we conclude that K is not monogenic. First F(x) = (x2 + x - 1)4(x2 - x - 1)4 in F3[x]. Let 1 = x2 + x - 1 and 2 = x2 - x - 1. Then F(x) = 1(x)6 + (21 - 6x)1(x)5 + (125 - 65x)1(x)4 +

9
(338 - 256x)1(x)3 + (468 - 474x)1(x)2 + (324 - 420x)1(x) + (72 - 144x) and F(x) = 1(x)6 + (21 + 6x)1(x)5 + (125 + 65x)1(x)4 + (338 + 256x)1(x)3 +
(468 + 474x)1(x)2 + (324 + 420x)1(x) + (72 + 144x) are the i-expansion of F(x) for i = 1, 2. Thus with respect to p = 3, N+i(F) = Si1 + Si2 has two sides joining the points (0, 2), (1, 1), and (4, 0) (see FIGURE6). Thus d(Sij) = 1 for every i, j = 1, 2, and so every i provides 2 prime ideals of ZK lying above 3 with residue degree 2 each one. It follows that there are 4 prime ideals of ZK lying above 3 with residue degree 2 each one. Since there is only 3 monic
irreducible polynomial of degree 2 over F3, namely, x2, 1, and 2, by Lemma 4.1, 3 is a common index divisor of K and K is not monogenic.
