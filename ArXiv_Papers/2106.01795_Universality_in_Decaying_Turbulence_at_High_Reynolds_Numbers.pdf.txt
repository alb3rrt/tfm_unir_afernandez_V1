In the limit of very large Reynolds numbers for homogeneous isotropic turbulence of an incompressible fluid, the statistics of the velocity differences between two points in space are expected to approach universal power laws at scales smaller than those at which energy is injected. Even at the highest Reynolds numbers available in laboratory and natural flows such universal power laws have remained elusive. On the other hand, power laws have been observed empirically in derived quantities, namely in the relative scaling in statistics of different orders according to the Extended Self Similarity hypothesis. Here we present experimental results from the Max Planck Variable Density Turbulence Tunnel over an unprecedented range of Reynolds numbers. We find that the velocity difference statistics take a universal functional form that is distinct from a power law. By applying a self-similar model derived for decaying turbulence to our data, an effective scaling exponent for the second moment can be derived that agrees well with that obtained from Extended Self Similarity.

Turbulence in a three-dimensional incompressible fluid can be described by a flow of kinetic energy from large energy injection length scales L to small viscous scales , where internal friction dissipates this kinetic energy into heat. For intermediate scales, i.e., in the inertial range, the statistics of turbulent velocity fluctuations are well described by the moments of velocity increments. The n-th order moments of velocity increments are called structure functions, Sn(r) = (u(x + r) - u(x))n . The separation between large and small scales, or the size of the inertial range, goes hand in hand with the magnitude of the main parameter capturing the intensity of a turbulent flow, which is the Reynolds number R = uRMS/. uRMS is the root-mean-squared velocity fluctuation,  is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, and  is the length scale defined in Taylor [1], where L  .
A fundamental question is to what extent turbulent self-organisation yields universal forms for statistics such as Sn(r). Universality can be understood as observations that are the same despite having been made in flows of very different origin, for instance in wind tunnels or in the atmospheric boundary layer. A more specific form of universality is the independence of universal features from changes in the Reynolds number in any given flow. This definition is intimately connected to Kolmogorov's seminal work in 1941 (K41) [3], which conjectured universal features to appear only at the small scales and

large Reynolds numbers, where turbulence would be statistically homogeneous, isotropic and stationary. Kolmogorov [3] posited that the flow-specific energy injection mechanisms impact the statistics only at large scales  L, but universal self-organisation prevails at scales r L. For intermediate scales L r , where the fluid inertia dominates over viscous forces, Kolmogorov [3] described this universality in terms of the structure functions Sn(r) defined above. In the inertial range, the mean power per unit mass, , describes the energy transfer from inertial scales to dissipative scales. Dimensional analysis then yields universal scaling laws for the inertial range

Sn(r) = Cn(r)n

where Cn are universal constants in Kolmogorov [3]. The K41 scaling laws are still widely used approxima-
tions [4], even though we know that the intermittent spatial distribution of dissipation demands corrections [5­7]. While much effort has been invested in modelling intermittency corrections to the scaling exponents n [7­14], the approach towards universal, R-independent scaling laws at R   is rarely questioned. An exception is the work by Barenblatt and Goldenfeld [15], where a continued but potentially universal R-dependence is assumed.
The configuration for which the scaling laws (1) have been derived is idealised. It is a practical challenge to separate viscous and non-universal large-scale effects sufficiently to form an inertial range where the scaling laws can be observed. Adequately large Reynolds numbers were available up to recently only in natural atmospheric

The curves collapse approximately onto a universal form for R > 2000 at scales extending up to 1000 ( 0.1L) as seen in the inset. This form extends from the smallest scales up to 0.1L and is different from a constant, which indicates that power law scaling is masked in these data. In contrast, the curves at R < 2000 change shape significantly with R. Inset: Zoom on the inertial range of the same curves. At the largest R a wave-like fine structure can be seen as in Sinhuber et al. [2]. Dashed lines: r0/ for the curves in (D). (B): Same as (A), but normalised by L. At the largest scales the curves follow a similar shape from the largest scales down to 0.2L. Dashed line: r0/L for the curve in (D). (C): Structure functions S2 compensated by the scale-invariant prediction, (r)2/3. (D): 2(r) evaluated at fixed r0/ given by the dashed lines in (A), and fixed r0/ given by the curve in (B).

flows, which are inhomogeneous and non-stationary, or turbulence in (super)fluid helium [16­19], where measurements are extremely challenging due to the small viscous length scales [20­24].
A large body of experimental and numerical data is available at lower R. At these R and at low orders n, Sn  rn/3 approximates the existing data [e.g. 26­ 28]. However, viscosity influences relatively large scales compared with the dissipation scale through the so called bottleneck [2, 29] shadowing the inertial range scaling in both experiments and numerical simulations [30­34]. Additional complications are the decay of turbulent kinetic energy in many experimental flows or the energy injec-

tion typical for sheared turbulence and forced numerical simulations. These effects are known to adversely affect the buildup of power law scaling in the inertial range [28, 35, 36]. It is known that the effects of decay and anisotropic energy injection are typically stronger than those of the scale-local forcing in numerical simulations [30, 35, 37]. In these cases, the statistics carry a Rdependence and no definite conclusions regarding universality have yet been drawn. The form of the statistics is then typically written as

Sn = Cn (r)n/3

FIG. 3. Same as Fig. 1 (D) but for 3 < n  6, showing as in Fig. 2 that the trends observed at the second order are visible also at higher orders. The solid black lines show the result of Kolmogorov's [3] dimensional analysis n = n/3, which lies above the data for values of r0 in the inertial range. Dashed lines are fits of 1 - 2R to the data excluding the largest three R.

Using closure models for the statistical evolution equations [25, 37, 38], empiric parameterisations for Fn [39­ 43], or physically motivated derivations of the large-scale terms [25, 33, 38, 44], functional forms for Fn can be found to describe data at low R. The results indicate that a dependence on R may not vanish before O(R) = 104 in decaying turbulence behind a passive grid.
In this article we show how velocity increment statistics approach a fully-developed inertial range that is independent of the Reynolds number above R  2000 up to the experimental limit of R  6000. From this we conclude that Fn(R, r/) is a non-trivial, R-independent and universal function at high Reynolds numbers.

I. MAIN
We conducted experiments in the Max Planck Variable Density Turbulence tunnel which has a volume of 88m3 and is pressurized with sulphur hexaflouride (SF6) at pressures between 1 and 15 bar, where an approximately homogeneous central region exists within the tunnel [45]. The turbulence was generated by an active grid with correlated forcing [29, 46]. We recorded time series of the streamwise velocity component using subminiature hot wires (Nanoscale Thermal Anemometry Probes, NSTAPs) [47] and conventional hot wires. The wire lengths were 4.
In eq. (3) we observe that the prefactors Cn as well as

FIG. 4. Comparisons of models (red, green) with experimental data (black) for two Reynolds numbers, R = 1300 (lower curves) and R = 4140 (upper curves, offset by 0.5 for clarity). Batchelor's formula is shown as green dashed lines, and the model in Yang et al. [25] as red solid lines. (A) Fits of models to S2 compensated by Kolmogorov's prediction eq. (2). At large R, the Batchelor formula assumes a more pronounced inertial range plateau than the data. (B) For power laws, the region of interest is the inertial range (100 < r/ < 10000 in the high-R case) as highlighted by the inset, and where the red curves follow the data more closely. For r/ < 100 the Batchelor interpolation is superior, and the Yang et al. [25] model performs poorly as expected. At scales larger than those in the inertial range, both fits have a similar quality.

Fig. 1 exemplifies our results at the second order for
selected R. In panels (A) and (B) we show the local power-law exponent 2(r) with the scale r normalised by the viscous length scale  and the energy injection scale
L, respectively. A power law prevails when n(r) assumes a constant value n = n/3 + µn, which is the scaling exponent. We find that for small r  , 2  2 (S2  r2),

as expected from continuity. Around r  100, 2(r) flattens as expected for the inertial range. The width of this approximate plateau increases with R, with a tilt evident even at the largest R. This shape appears not to change starting around R  2000 and above. At yet larger scales, 2(r) approaches zero, its large-scale limiting value for even n. Panel (C) of Fig. 1 shows the corresponding structure functions S2(r) compensated by the Kolmogorov prediction eq. (2). No clear plateau can be observed even at the largest R indicating the absence of plain self-similar scaling. To better illustrate the Rdependence of the local power law exponent 2(r) we plot its value at specific scales r0 within the inertial range as functions of R in Fig. 1 (D). Overall, 2(r0/) reaches a constant for R > 2000 and any fixed r0 in the inertial range. Therefore, the shape of (r/L)µn Fn(r/) in the inertial range becomes independent of R for R > 2000. However, the particular asymptotic values of n(r0/) found at each specific scale r0/ in the inertial range differ by up to 0.2 ­ far more than typical intermittency corrections. This implies that we cannot infer a single inertial range exponent, and cannot disentangle µn from F given the data alone.
The above observations apply also at higher orders, which are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. At the largest R and smallest scales observed, the data are likely influenced by insufficient probe resolution. This is particularly important at higher orders.
In the following we investigate the extent to which our observations can be explained by finite Reynolds number models in order to facilitate the inference of µn. In the present experiments turbulence is excited by the active grid and the turbulent kinetic energy decays subsequently. In freely decaying turbulence, the energy injection scale L grows over time [48, 49]. In our experiments, however, the growth of L is limited by the dimensions of the wind tunnel's cross section. Decaying turbulence in a confined domain was recently modeled by Yang, Pumir and Xu [25]. The authors derive the functional forms for the viscous and large-scale cutoffs of inertial range power laws from a closure theory and self-similar decay laws (see Methods for details). In the model the effective scaling exponent of the second order structure function (n/3 + µ2F ) is one parameter, while the other describes the decay and is related to the normalised rate of dissipation C = L/u3. The model can thus be used to separate the inertial-range scaling from large-scale effects in the present experiments. An alternative is the ad-hoc formula after Batchelor [39, 42], which provides smooth transitions between the different scaling regimes (rn,rn ,r0), but has no further physical justification.
In Fig. 4 we show the two models in red ([25]) and green ([42]) with parameters fitted to the experimental data. The fits indicate that the model for decaying turbulence in a confined domain [25] is a better approximation at higher Reynolds numbers than the Batchelor interpolation formula[39, 42], whereas the Batchelor formula describes the data better at lower R. Both models

asymptotically approach power laws in the inertial range
at very large R. At second order the model in Yang et al. [25] better predicts the sustained influence of tur-
bulence decay down to relatively small scales and is close
to the data in the inertial range.
We interpret the model in Yang et al. [25] as a physical model for (r/)µn F2(R, r/) and extract the intermittency correction µn from the data. In Fig. 5 we compare the intermittency correction µ2F from this model of decaying turbulence [25] to an established method for
extracting µ2 from the data alone. This latter Extended Self Similarity (ESS) method was introduced in Benzi et al. [50] and assumes that Fn  F|3|, such that ratios of different order structure functions show an extended scal-
ing range with reduced effects of the finite Reynolds num-
ber and reduced uncertainty in the inertial-range scaling
exponent 2,ESS. We find good agreement between this method of extended self-similarity (ESS) and the model
parameter 2F = µ2F + 2/3. We are finally in the position to measure the universal
modulation F (R, r/) at large Reynolds numbers and small scales. For this we consider the curve

F2(R, r/)

=

S2 C2(r)2/3(r/)µ2

.

(5)

We determine C2 by normalising the maximum of the resulting curves to 1 and fix µ2 = 0.693 from the ESS estimate. Fig. 5 (B) shows that F2 begins to collapse around R  1500, i.e. assumes a universal form at asypmtotically high R. To show this more rigorously, we take F (R = 4141) as an approximation towards this asymptotic form and plot the relative divergences towards this reference. In the inset of Fig. 5 (A) we observe that starting around R  1500 the curves are within ±3% of each other.
In this article we show experimental data on how the velocity increment statistics approach a fully-developed inertial range whose shape is independent of the Reynolds number. While this is in agreement with Kolmogorov's hypothesis of universality, the scaling laws (and their intermittency corrections) anticipated for these conditions are not directly observed. That is, the inertial range is only approximately described by power laws and carries a R-independent modulation, F2(r/) in eq. (5). Data from entirely different flow geometries, such as a jet [28], suggest that F2(r/) is sensitive to the overall flow configuration for n = 3, but less so for n = 2. We observed little variance for different active grid schemes. A careful analysis of other high R-data is of great interest in the light of our results. We also show that the widely used empirical ESS scheme to obtain the intermittency correction µ [50] gives an equivalent answer at second order to a physically motivated model of the entire structure function [25].
In decaying turbulence the inertial range grows more slowly than in continuously forced turbulence, and the time-dependent term in the statistical evolution equation does not vanish [25, 28, 30, 33, 35, 51]. Indeed, a

FIG. 5. Upper Plot: The second-order scaling exponent 2 measured in different ways and in different laboratory experiments. Circles show 2 found by fitting eq.(A4) to data from active and passive grid experiments. Squares show extended self-similarity (ESS) exponents, S2(|S3|), for the same datasets. According to the model fits, 2 approaches a constant 2F = 0.698±0.011 (dashed) larger than Kolmogorov's prediction (dotted) [3]. We attribute the slight downward trend in the last two data points to probe effects and the anisotropic forcing that we used to reach these high R. For comparison we include data from Mydlarski and Warhaft [27]. For R < 300, no ESS exponent could be measured due to an insufficient inertial range. The shaded region corresponds to the range of values that the local slope 2(r) takes within 100 < r < 0.1L. Lower Plot: Approach of F2 measured by eq. (5) towards an R-universal shape. Starting around R  1500 the curves collapse for r < 0.1L. Inset: The relative difference, (F2 - F2(R = 4141))/F2(R = 4141) shows universality to within ±3% (indicated by the shaded area) for about three decades in r. The plots include measurements at a total of 29 different Reynolds numbers.

model [25] for the decay of turbulence (confined as in our experiment) predicts an influence of the decay its structure from large scales into the inertial range and allows us to quantify the intermittency correction µ2. While the model we use is designed to approach an inertial range power law, our data suggest that above R  2000 the approach to a power law is halted. We show instead that above this Reynolds number the statistics are described by a universal and nontrivial shape from small scales up to r  0.1L.

When turbulence is not isotropic, scaling laws appear only when projecting onto appropriate symmetry groups [52­54]. The instrumentation in the present experiment allows only unidirectional velocity measurements, such that anisotropy can be inferred only indirectly. The measurements might therefore represent the approach to universality in anisotropic turbulence with little consequences for the idealised Kolmogorov framework. However, the measurement volume is relatively free of mean shear and the results are remarkably robust even when the turbulence is excited using an anisotropic active grid or a classical and static grid.
We have shown that F2 is a R-independent and nontrivial function of the scale r with indications from Figs. 2 and 3 that higher orders behave similarly. We point out that ESS means that Fn is similar for all even orders. The processes that shape the asymptotic form of Fn and that interfere with power-law scaling are evidently open questions. This already bears the potential for substantial advancements to applied turbulence models and the scaling seen in engineering wind tunnel studies. Future studies will need to investigate the degree to which Fn changes from flow to flow. A flow-independent function of the n-th order statistics, if it existed, would have farreaching implications for turbulence models and closure

schemes. We end by commenting that deviations from power-
law scaling in the inertial range have in the past been dismissed as finite Reynolds number effects that were to be circumvented. Viscous effects are important when the Reynolds number is low. Our results suggest however, that deviations from power-law scaling are an important feature of naturally occurring decaying turbulence, whatever its Reynolds number.

Appendix A: Methods
1. The Max Planck Variable Density Turbulence Tunnel
The Variable Density Turbulence Tunnel (VDTT) [55] is a closed-loop wind tunnel, which can be operated with any non-corrosive gas at pressures up to 15 bar. For the experiments presented here it was operated with sulphurhexaflouride (SF6), which offers a low kinematic viscosity that decreases with density while being relatively harmless and inert. The Reynolds number of the flow in the VDTT can be finely adjusted in three largely independent ways up to levels typical for atmospheric turbulence: (i) the large-scale forcing with a novel active grid, (ii) the mean flow speed U up to 5.5 m/s by adjusting the rotation frequency of its fan, and (iii) the kinematic viscosity  by changing the static pressure.
Flow structures of variable size are introduced using a mosaic-like arrangement of individually controllable paddles ("active grid"). It allows us to obstruct the flow on

finely adjustable time- and length scales [29, 46]. The

resulting grid length scale is indicated in Fig. 7 as red

vertical lines. In this way we control the energy injection

scale between about 0.1m L 0.6m. L is indicated as

short black vertical lines in Fig. 7.

The small kinematic viscosity of pressurized SF6 permits the existence of very small flow structures. The size

of these structures scales with the viscous length scale

 = (3/)1/4, where  = 15 (u/x)2 . For the range

of ambient pressures 1 bar < p < 15 bar, this viscous

length is between 250µm  10µm.

In our experiment, the turbulent kinetic energy u2RMS decays along the length of the measurement section, but

the integral length scale L remains constant or also de-

cays over time (see Fig. 6). This is in contrast to freely de-

caying turbulence, where L grows with time [49, 56]. We

believe that the boundaries of the measurement section

with cross-section 1.2 m × 1.5 m (with 0.1 m L 0.6 m)

suppresses this growth. We found this to be relatively

independent of the way we estimate L. We chose to use

L=

Other definitions of L impact the results at small R and

the scatter of the data otherwise.

2. Measurement Technology and Data Analysis
We record time series of hot-wire signals and convert them into one-dimensional flow fields assuming that the turbulent fluctuations are passively advected across the sensor by the mean flow U . Thus, a time step t is converted to a spatial increment x = U t [1]. We use a commercial constant temperature anemome-

9

ter (Dantec StreamWare) to drive and acquire data from Nanoscale Thermal Anemometry Probes (NSTAP) provided by Princeton University [57­59]. These ultra-small hot wire probes average the flow field over a length of only 30 µm, which is sufficient for this experiment. For flows where the viscous length scales are larger, we also use commercial hot wires from Dantec Dynamics with sensing length 450 µm ( 4). The probe length is indicated by dotted vertical lines in Fig. 7 and far away from the region of interest.
To achieve converged statistics the data was acquired for 103 - 104 eddy turnover times (up to 8 hours) between 150 < R < 6000.
The frequencies (and wavenumbers) encountered in the measurements presented here are generally in a range that is not particularly demanding for this combination of sensor and anemometer circuitry [60­62]. The temporal resolution is determined by the noise filtering frequency and the frequency response of the measurement system. The frequency response of the system is not perfectly flat anymore starting around 1 kHz [60]. The range of scales we are interested in is therefore in the flat part of the frequency response curve. To illustrate this, the length scales corresponding to a measurement frequency of 1 kHz are indicated in Fig. 7 as vertical lines in the color of the corresponding 2(r). The noise filtering frequency is always at frequencies above 1kHz.
The experiments presented here were taken under different ambient pressures and different active grid forcing schemes to allow for a careful check of the hot wire fidelity. We thus ensure the robustness of the results against probe- or flow geometry-induced biases. We emphasise that all conclusions presented here are independent of the frequencies where turbulent fluctuations are measured, the dissipation length scale, and the active grid forcing.

3. Fits to the Model Spectrum [25]

The evolution equation of the velocity energy spectrum E(k, t) can be derived directly from the NavierStokes-Equation in the isotropic case and is known as the Karman-Howarth-Lin equation.

tE(k, t) = -k(k, t) - 2k2E(k, t). (A1)

The first term on the RHS describes the nonlinear transfer of energy from small to large wavenumbers and ultimately prevents the closure of the equation, since it is a third-order term. The Pao closure [63] used in the model by Yang et al. [25] assumes that the transfer term  is local in wavenumber space and has a self-similar form:

(k, t) = C01/3k5/3E(k, t)

(A2)

The second term on the RHS of (A1) represents the viscous dissipation at the smallest flow scales. This yields a closed form of the Karman-Howarth-Lin equation. The

model by Yang et al. further assumes that the energy spectrum can be assembled by a large scale term fL(kL), a small scale term f(k), and a self-similar inertial range:

E(k, t) = Ck2/3k5/3f(k)fL(kL)

(A3)

These assumptions are now combined with a general, selfsimilar decay of turbulent kinetic energy. In the case of a confined domain, where the parameter describing dL/dt tends to zero, this model predicts the energy spectrum

For the purpose of measuring a scaling exponent, we

replaced the term (kL)-5/3 used in the original formula-

tion of the spectrum with (kL)-(2F +1), where the fitting

parameter 2F is the inertial range scaling exponent for the second order structure function[64]. The parameters

C and AK are related through C = -AK (6/)1/3. In practice, AK describes the large-scale part of the energy spectrum, which is heavily influenced by the decay.

The one-dimensional versions of S2 and E(k) are related through the following integral transform [65]:

(A5)

To obtain the fits shown in Fig. 4, we have searched for parameters AK , and 2F that yield best fits of the logarithmic derivative of eq. (A5) to the experimentally measured 2(r).
It can be shown that C = -AK (6/)1/3. This quantity is related to the dissipation constant C = L/u3 relating

the large scale energy injection and the small scale energy transfer rate . AK is the non-dimensionalized timeevolution of the energy spectrum prefactor d(CK 2/3)/dt, which is a free parameter.

The second derivative has been estimated by a Taylor

expansion for kr < 0.001. Therefore, the model (A4)
in combination with its underlying closure hypothesis
eq. (A3) implicitly predicts S3. Note that strictly speaking the combination of the intermittency-corrected model
eq. (A4) and the K41-type closure eq. (A3) yields a third
order exponent 3 slightly different from 1. It is reassuring to see that instead leaving the 5/3-term in eq. (A3)
as a generic scaling and fitting the resulting model to S3 yields   const in the inertial range so that S3  r.
