## Abstract

Higgs boson decays produce pairs of W bosons in a maximally entangled state, the spins of which can be expected to violate Bell inequalities. We show that the spin density matrix of the $W^\pm$ pair may be reconstructed experimentally from the directions of the emitted leptons, and from it the expectation values of various Bell operators determined. Simulations of $H \rightarrow W^+W^-$ indicate that violation of the CHSH inequality is unlikely to be measurable, however the CGLMP inequality is near-maximally violated, with large statistical significances which might be observable even with existing LHC data.
