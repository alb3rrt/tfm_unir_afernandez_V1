Abstract
When the climate system is forced, e.g. by emission of greenhouse gases, it responds on multiple time scales. As temperatures rise, feedback processes might intensify or weaken. Current methods to analyze feedback strength, however, do not take such state dependency into account; they only consider changes in (global mean) temperature and assume all feedbacks are linearly related to that. This makes (transient) changes in feedback strengths almost intangible and generally leads to underestimation of future warming. Here, we present a multivariate (and spatially explicit) framework that facilitates dissection of climate feedbacks over time scales. Using this framework, information on the composition of projected (transient) future climates and feedback strengths can be obtained. Moreover, it can be used to make projections for many emission scenarios through linear response theory. The new framework is illustrated using the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2).

1 Introduction

Were the climate system free of feedback processes, it would be easy to predict and control the future climate (Arrhenius, 1896). Unfortunately, the climate system is peppered with feedback loops (Heinze et al., 2019; Von der Heydt et al., 2020). Because of these, climate change can get suppressed or enhanced, making future projections hard (Sherwood et al., 2020). Therefore, detailed knowledge of all relevant feedback processes is required to accurately assess potential future climates. However, knowledge of the current strengths of climate feedbacks is not enough. Over time, as the climate state changes, the strengths of climate feedbacks also change (Gregory & Andrews, 2016; Marvel, Pincus, Schmidt, & Miller, 2018; Armour, Bitz, & Roe, 2013); for instance, the albedo-increasing effect of ice is only relevant when there (still) is ice.
As the Earth warms, the strength of positive feedbacks increases (Bony et al., 2006). Therefore, projections based only on current knowledge of climate feedbacks underestimate future climate change ­ especially the committed warming that is to come even if zero emission is achieved (Marvel et al., 2018; Goodwin, 2018; Senior & Mitchell, 2000). To properly assess different emission scenarios, it is crucial to identify all relevant feedback mechanisms and, additionally, to quantify how their strengths change over time.
For future temperature projections with global climate models, currently the focus lies with the following feedback processes (Zelinka et al., 2020; Klocke, Quaas, & Stevens, 2013; Cess, 1975). First, the Planck radiation feedback suppresses warming due to increased outgoing radiation. Second, the lapse rate feedback also suppresses warming due to an increase in long-wave radiation escaping to space (Sinha, 1995). Third is the ice-albedo feedback that enhances warming through a less reflective Earth surface (Curry, Schramm, & Ebert, 1995). Fourth is the water vapour feedback which boosts warming because of increased atmospheric water vapour content (Manabe & Wetherald, 1967). Finally, there is the cloud feedback, describing changes in cloud type and distribution, which could enhance or suppress warming (Cess & Potter, 1987).
The effect of a feedback process is quantified by its contribution to the climate system's radiative response to a certain experienced radiative forcing ­ in the current Anthropocene primarily caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, the top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance N (that equals zero when the climate system is in equilibrium) is given by the sum of the radiative forcing F and the radiative response R, i.e.

N (t) = F (t) + R(t).

(1)

This response R is the sum of the feedback contributions of all relevant feedbacks. So, writing Rj for the feedback contribution of feedback j,

R(t) = Rj(t),

where the sum is over all feedback processes. Classically, the feedback strength j (also called feedback parameter ) is given by the feedback contribution per unit warming, i.e.

j

:=

Rj (t) T (t)

.

(3)

From this, the top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance N can be related to the warming T as





N (t) = F (t) +  j T (t),

(4)

jF

which can be used for climate projections (Gregory et al., 2004). However, the climate system responds on many, vastly different time scales (Von der Heydt et al., 2020). In
particular, not all feedback processes react similarly on all of these time scales. Consequently, there is no linear relationship between all feedback contributions Rj and the global warming T (Andrews, Gregory, & Webb, 2015; Armour, 2017; Knutti & Rugenstein, 2015). Hence, computations of feedback strengths j often find these to change over time (Senior & Mitchell, 2000; Boer, Hamilton, & Zhu, 2005); they are certainly not constant, as is often implicitly assumed (Zelinka et al., 2020; Klocke et al., 2013; Meraner, Mauritsen, & Voigt, 2013).
We propose here to extend the classical framework to include dynamics on multiple time scales. To this end, feedback strengths should not be computed for the total time series, as in equation (3), but they should be separated in (Koopman) modal contributions instead. This makes the time-dependency of the various feedback processes explicit and opens the possibility of projections ­ both transient and equilibrium ­ for individual feedback contributions under any forcing scenario.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we describe the theoretical framework, define new feedback strength metrics, and explain the computations of the feedback contributions. In sections 3.1-3.2, the framework is applied in a study of climate feedbacks in a 1, 000 year long abrupt4xCO2 experiment in the `Community Earth System Model version 2' (CESM2). In section 3.3, projections of feedback contributions are made for and compared against output of CESM2's 1pctCO2 experiment. Finally, section 4 contains a summary and discussion.

2 Method and Model

2.1 Method: the new climate feedback framework

From linear response theory (Proistosescu & Huybers, 2017; Ruelle, 2009; Aengenheyster, Feng, Van Der Ploeg, & Dijkstra, 2018), the change (response) in an observable O due to a certain forcing g is given by

t

O(t) = G[O]  g (t) = G[O](t - s) g(s)ds,

(5)

0

where G[O] is the Green function for observable O. The Green functions in the climate system are well-

approximated by a sum of decaying exponentials (the Koopman modes), with only the contribution of the different

modes depending on the observable O. That is,

M

G[O](t) =

m[O] e-t/m ,

(6)

m=1

where the sum is over all M modes, m is the m-th mode's time scale and m[O] is the contribution of mode m to the observable's Green function. Because of this, following e.g. Proistosescu and Huybers (2017), the response of observable O can also be written as

M

O(t) =

m[O] Mgm(t),

(7)

m=1

where Mgm(t) :=

t 0

e-(t-s)/m

g(s)ds

contains

all

time-dependencies

and

m[O]

all

observable-dependencies.

Since all feedback contributions Rj and the global warming T adhere to this formulation, it is possible to

define the feedback strength of feedback j per mode m as

m j

:=

m[Rj ] m[T ]

.

(8)

2

Additionally, the instantaneous feedback strength at time t can be defined as the incremental change in feedback contribution Rj per incremental change in temperature T (i.e. the local slope of the graph (T, Rj) at time t):

ijnst(t) :=

d dt

Rj

(t)

d dt

T

(t)

(9)

Using this framework, it is also possible to estimate properties of the eventual equilibrium state ­ if such state exists. For instance, if g(t)  g¯, Mgm(t) = g¯m 1 - e-t/m , the equilibrium O is given by

M

O =

m[O] g¯ m.

(10)

m=1

The equilibrium feedback strength j for feedback j is then defined as

j

:=

Rj T 

=

M m=1

m

M m=1

m

m[Rj ] m[T ]

.

(11)

A more elaborate treatment of the mathematics of this framework is given in SI-Text S1. Below, we use this

framework on two idealised experiments in CESM2 to understand the temporal evolution of (the strength of)

climate feedbacks in these scenarios.

2.2 Model: CESM2 abrupt4xCO2 and 1pctCO2 experiments

We focus on forcing experiments conducted with the model CESM2 (Danabasoglu et al., 2020), specifically on the model's abrupt4xCO2 (1, 000y long) and 1pctCO2 (150y long) experiments in CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016). The abrupt4xCO2 experiment is used for fitting of the parameters and computations of feedback strengths per mode; the 1pctCO2 experiment is used to test projections made within the presented framework.
As feedback contributions are not outputted directly by any climate model, these have been determined using additional methodology. For this, we have used the radiative kernel approach (Soden et al., 2008; Shell, Kiehl, & Shields, 2008), in which feedback contributions are computed (per grid point at location x) as

Rj(x, t)

=

N yj

(x)

yj(x, t),

(12)

where yj is the relevant (derived) state variable for the j-th feedback and N/yj(x) is the pre-computed radiative kernel. We have used the publicly available CESM-CAM5 kernels from Pendergrass, Conley, and Vitt (2018); Pendergrass (2017a, 2017b). There are others available, but differences between kernels are typically small. The procedure for the cloud feedback contribution is somewhat different because of its more nonlinear nature, but is nevertheless computed following common practice (Soden et al., 2008; Shell et al., 2008; Klocke et al., 2013) ­ see SI-Text S4 for more details.

3 Results

3.1 Temporal evolution, abrupt4xCO2
From CESM2 model output, feedback contributions Rj(x, t), top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance N (x, t) and near-surface temperature increase T (x, t) were computed; changes in observables are determined with respect to the temporal average of a control experiment with pre-industrial CO2 levels. From these, globally averaged datasets Rj (t), N (t) and T (t) were derived. These global time series have been fitted to equation (7), with exception of N (t) that also includes the radiative forcing and is fitted to

M

N (t) = Fabr + R (t) = Fabr +

m[R]

(t),

m=1

(13)

where the subscript `abr' indicates that the forcings are from the abrupt4xCO2 experiment. More details of the procedure can be found in SI-Text S2.
First, the amount of modes M needs to be determined. Tests with various values for M have indicated M = 3 is the best choice here: M < 3 does not capture all dynamics and M > 3 has no significant benefits; see SI-Figure S1. This is also in agreement with other reports that typically find two or three relevant modes (Caldeira & Myhrvold, 2013; Tsutsui, 2017; Proistosescu & Huybers, 2017; Bastiaansen, Dijkstra, & von der Heydt, 2020).

With M = 3 fixed, the other parameters are fitted with nonlinear regression. The values for the fitted parameters are given in SI-Table S1. In Figure 1, the datasets are shown along with the fits and projections, showing a very good resemblance.
From the fitted parameters, the feedback strengths per mode are computed using equation (8). In Table 1, the results are shown per mode and for the equilibrium values. A plot of the change in (instantaneous) feedback strength over time is given in Figure 2A. This shows behaviour on three distinct time scales: (1) a short time scale 1 = 4.5y, (2) an intermediate time scale 2 = 127y and (3) a long time scale 3 = 889y. The shorter time scale is in agreement with other studies (Zelinka et al., 2020), and long-term behaviour seems very plausible. The Planck feedback does not change much over time. The lapse rate feedback becomes weaker over time since temperatures increase. The surface albedo feedback diminishes as sea-ice is melting. The water vapour feedback, however, strengthens as warmer air can contain more water, which ­ as demonstrated here ­ does lead to an almost tripling in this feedback's strength over time. Finally, the cloud feedback becomes more dominant over time. The estimated equilibrium values are a bit higher generally compared to other studies (e.g. Zelinka et al. (2020)) since longer time scales are incorporated in the present study, which leads to higher temperature values and more positive total feedback strength (Proistosescu & Huybers, 2017; Rugenstein et al., 2020; Marvel et al., 2018; Goodwin, 2018).
Since the individual feedback contributions Rj should sum to the total radiative response R, feedback strengths should satisfy m = jF m j . However, because of ignored feedback interactions, imperfect radiative kernels and other limitations of the feedback contribution computations, a mismatch of up to 10% is deemed inconsequential. Looking at the feedback parameters per mode in Table 1, we see a good balance for the intermediate time scale (-0.02 W m-2K-1 imbalance), but not for the short (+0.54 W m-2K-1 imbalance) or long time scales (-1.46 W m-2K-1 imbalance). Taking the large uncertainty into account for the shortest time scale, this imbalance might be insignificant still. However, for the long time scale, the imbalance is large and even the signs are not the same. This points to a missing negative feedback on this time scale (or inaccuracies in the computational methods for the feedback contributions Rj). Because the equilibrium values show a smaller imbalance (-0.43 W m-2K-1), the alleged missing feedback (or feedbacks) seem to be especially important during the transient state.

3.2 Spatial distribution, abrupt4xCO2
With a slight modification of (8), the spatial structure of the (Koopman) modes can be included. Following a similar procedure in Proistosescu and Huybers (2017), we take

M

Rj(x, t) =

m[Rj ] (x)

Mgabr
m

(t),

m=1

(14)

and similar formulas for N (x, t) and T (x, t). More details can be found in SI-Text S2.2. The space-dependent m[Rj](x) encompasses the spatial structure of the observable Rj in the m-th mode. Again, it is also possible to estimate equilibrium properties, leading to an estimation of the spatial distribution
of feedback contributions and warming in equilibrium. Using the time scales m from the fits of the global observables, the spatial coefficients m[Rj](x) can be computed efficiently using linear regression methods.

Equilibrium distributions are derived from the fitted spatial modes; initial forcing F (x) is obtained directly from fits.

In SI-Figures S3­S10, the spatial modes of all feedback contributions, warming and radiative imbalance are
given. The estimated equilibrium distributions are shown in Figure 3. The patterns of feedback contributions
are in agreement with previous studies (Proistosescu & Huybers, 2017; Dong et al., 2020; Armour et al., 2013;
Boeke, Taylor, & Sejas, 2020; Andrews & Webb, 2018; Dessler, 2013; Soden et al., 2008; Andrews et al., 2015),
although they seem more pronounced here ­ probably due to a better incorporation of long-term behaviour. Near the poles, temperature increase gets close to +30C (compared to +12C near the equator) and large changes (up to +135 W m-2) in surface albedo are found related to sea-ice melting. Moreover, the lapse rate feedback contribution increases by about 10 W m-2 in these polar regions. Near the equator, the water vapour feedback gets much stronger (more than +50W m-2) over the oceans ­ especially in the Pacific cold tongue where changes up to +120W m-2 are found. Cloud feedback changes mostly over southern hemisphere oceans (up to +69 W m-2), and northern hemisphere changes are smaller (on average only +2.7 W m-2) compared to previous studies (Andrews
& Webb, 2018; Dong et al., 2020; Armour et al., 2013).

response theory (Ruelle, 2009; Lucarini & Sarno, 2011; Ragone, Lucarini, & Lunkeit, 2016), has been used for

warming projections already in many models, including global climate models (Lembo, Lucarini, & Ragone, 2020;

Aengenheyster et al., 2018; Maier-Reimer & Hasselmann, 1987; Hasselmann, Sausen, Maier-Reimer, & Voss,

1993). Although typically used on an ensemble of model runs and for smaller forcings, we use it here nevertheless

to illustrate its potency. More details can be found in SI-Text S3.

In Figure 4, projections for global feedback contributions are shown along with data coming directly from

the CESM2 1pctCO2 experiment. Qualitatively, the projections are able to reproduce the actual trends in the

globally averaged observables. The quantitative values overestimate feedback contributions by 10% - 20% (less

for the lapse rate feedback; more for cloud and long-wave water vapour feedbacks up to about t = 120y), which

seems reasonable for this set-up. Projections for the temporal evolution of instantaneous feedback strengths in

this scenario are given in Figure 2B. These show lasting changes over centuries ­ primarily in (long-wave) water

vapour feedback, surface albedo feedback and cloud feedback ­ and a less negative total feedback parameter,

indicating the climate system becomes more sensitive to radiative forcing over time.

Using the same approach, it is also possible to make projections for the evolution of the spatial distributions.

In SI-Figures S11­S18 the projections for the feedback contributions Rj, the radiative imbalance N and the

temperature increase T at t = 140y are shown. Videos showing these results for other times are also available

(SI-videos). From all of these, it can be seen that the spatial projections reproduce the general larger spatial patterns and even some of the smaller features, although the internal variability is of course not present in the projections. The spatial patterns are similar to those found in the abrupt4xCO2 experiment (Figure 3) and show the same kind of response in polar and equatorial regions. In general, the projections seem to overestimate the spatial feedback contributions, similar to the overestimation of the global feedback contributions.
4 Summary and discussion
In this study, we have introduced a new multivariate feedback framework that enables analysis and projections of individual climate feedbacks, including their spatial distribution, over different time scales. This framework deviates from the common practice of linearly regressing feedback contributions to global warming (Zelinka et al., 2020; Marvel et al., 2018; Klocke et al., 2013; Meraner et al., 2013) ­ which is not valid, especially when considering long-term effects (Andrews et al., 2015; Armour, 2017; Knutti & Rugenstein, 2015). Instead, these contributions are here taken into account directly, and temporal evolution is explicitly considered via a nonlinear regression to obtain (Koopman) modes for each feedback. These modes, indicating behaviour over different time scales, encapsulate the climate system's dynamics and can thus be used both for analysis and projections of climate feedbacks ­ even for other forcing scenarios.
Using the presented framework, we have analyzed an abrupt4xCO2 experiment in CESM2. This clearly showed evolution of climate feedbacks over time, such as a diminishing of surface albedo feedback in the polar regions as sea-ice melts. Strikingly, the water vapour and cloud feedbacks showed a large increase over time: water vapour feedback, primarily over oceans around the equator, almost tripled in strength over a 1,000 year period and cloud feedback mainly changed over southern hemisphere oceans. Analysis also showed that the (commonly) considered feedback processes do not sum up to the total feedback for long time scales, pointing to a missing negative feedback on these time scales. Since estimated equilibrium feedback strengths do balance, the alleged missing feedback (or

8

feedbacks) is expected to play a role primarily during the transient. As such, the ocean heat uptake is a good candidate to fill this gap. However, as of now, no radiative kernels exist for the ocean heat uptake's effect on the top of atmosphere radiative balance, making it impossible to test this hypothesis. Nevertheless, tracking its effect over time seems necessary to accurately understand the long-term transient behaviour.
Another benefit of tracking the temporal evolution of climate feedbacks is that this makes it possible to project the climatic change for all sorts of emission scenarios without the need to have dedicated model experiments for them all. In this paper, we have shown the capabilities of such projections by comparing them to a (single) 1pctCO2 experiment with the same CESM2 model. The projections did capture the qualitative trends, but also showed an overestimation for almost all global and spatial climate feedback contributions. However, this possibly is due to internal variability associated with a single run. Hence, results are expected to be even better quantitatively when a (potentially small) ensemble of runs is used, as application of similar linear response techniques on e.g. temperature response have shown previously (Lembo et al., 2020; Aengenheyster et al., 2018).
As climate models become more and more detailed, these models also become more computationally expensive. Therefore, it is practically impossible to compute climate responses for many forcing scenarios and/or on very long time scales. As climate feedbacks become more positive with rising temperatures, it is necessary to track these changes to prevent underestimation of climate change and adequately account for committed (long-term) warming. Hence, both extrapolation techniques and response theory can play a significant role to alleviate the gaps. The multivariate feedback framework in this study can contribute to this, allowing for long-term estimation and climate projections for different forcing scenarios. Moreover, as these projections are multivariate, they can inform us on more than global mean warming alone, and also indicate how a potential future climate state may behave differently compared to our current one.

1 S1 Tracking the temporal evolution of Climate Feedbacks

2 The Earth is not a closed system, because energy can enter and leave the atmosphere in the form of radiation.

3 The net amount of the top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance is typically denoted by N and equals the amount

4 of incoming shortwave solar radiation minus the outgoing short- and longwave radiation (i.e. N = NSW, -

5 NSW, - NLW,). The precise amounts of these outgoing radiative fluxes is influenced by any forcing (e.g. due to

6 CO2 emissions) and by the many feedback processes of the Earth system (e.g., sea-ice melting, changes in surface

7 albedo and cloud formation). Hence, the radiative imbalance N can be seen as a function of any applied forcing

8 µ and the system state y; that is,

9

N = N (y; µ) .

(S1.1)

10 The Earth system is said to be in (radiative) equilibrium when N = 0. So, for a given (constant) forcing µ = µA,

11 an equilibrium state y = yA has to satisfy

12

N yA; µA = 0.

(S1.2)

13 If the amount of forcing were to change, say µ(t) = µA + µ(t) (not necessarily as a function of time), the system
14 state y(t) and the radiative imbalance N (t) will respond and change over time. Denoting the new system state 15 by y(t) = yA + y(t), a substitution in (S1.1) gives the new imbalance as

16

N (t) = N yA + y(t); µA + µ(t) .

(S1.3)

17 If the perturbation µ(t) is small enough, the response y(t) will also typically be small. In this case, this 18 expression can be approximated via a Taylor expansion as a (multi-)linear function. Specifically,

19

N (t) = N

yA; µA

+

N µ

yA; µA

µ(t)

+

N y

yA; µA

y(t) + h.o.t.

(S1.4)

20 In this expression, N yA; µA is the radiative imbalance in the unperturbed state, which equals zero per (S1.2).

21

The

term

N µ

yA; µA µ(t) denotes the direct effect of the forcing and is typically called the radiative response

22

F (t).

The resulting radiative response

R(t) to this

forcing is given

by

N y

yA; µA y(t), which includes all

23 the climate feedback processes. Finally, h.o.t. stands for `higher order terms' and includes all non-linear and

24 interaction terms that are assumed to be small [Shell et al., 2008, Soden et al., 2008].

25 The radiative response R(t) is formed by a combination of all relevant climate feedbacks. The prime ones 26 typically considered are Planck feedback, lapse rate feedback, surface albedo feedback, water vapour feedback 27 and cloud feedback [Klocke et al., 2013, Meraner et al., 2013, Shell et al., 2008, Soden et al., 2008, Zelinka et al., 28 2020]. For the mathematical framework here, we denote the set of all relevant climate feedbacks by F (which 29 thus might include other, or undiscovered, feedbacks). Then R is given by the sum over all these feedbacks as

30

R(t)

=

jF

Rj (t)

:=

jF

N yj

yA; µA

yj (t).

(S1.5)

31 So, Rj(t) denotes the contribution over time of the j-th feedback to the full radiative response of the (linearised) 32 climate system. Henceforth, we will refer to these as feedback contributions.

33 In climate studies, typically, the feedback contributions are not reported; instead, values for feedback parameters

34 (or feedback strengths) are given: the feedback contribution per Kelvin warming. Mathematically, these are defined

35 as
36

j (t)

:=

Rj (t) T (t)

,

(S1.6)

37 where T (t) denotes the change in global mean surface temperature (GMST). Moreover, normally also a full

38 climate feedback parameter  is defined as

R(t)

39

(t) := T (t) ,

(S1.7)

40 which ­ if all feedback processes are taken into account ­ leads to (t) = jF j(t) (with possibly a small 41 inconsistency because of the neglected higher order and interaction terms in (S1.4)). Here, we have explicitly
42 denoted the time-dependency of j(t). However, often, the feedback parameters are interpreted as constants in 43 time. In practice, their values are even inferred from transient simulation data via linear regression of Rj(t) = 44 jT (t) [e.g. Klocke et al., 2013, Marvel et al., 2018, Meraner et al., 2013, Zelinka et al., 2020].

45 However, such linearity assumption does not hold ­ especially when incorporating climate dynamics over longer 46 time scales [Andrews et al., 2015, Armour, 2017, Knutti and Rugenstein, 2015]. In general, a linear dynamical

2

47 system that is perturbed by some change in forcing g(t) (e.g., g(t) = µ(t)), follows relatively simple dynamics:

48 the change of any (global mean) observable O evolves as a sum over (Koopman) eigenmodes [Proistosescu and

49 Huybers, 2017], i.e.

M

50

O (t) =

m[O] Mgm(t),

(S1.8)

m=1

51 where M is the amount of (relevant) modes, m[O] the contribution of the m-th mode and Mgm(t) the m-th mode's 52 response to the applied forcing g. Concretely ­ assuming the system has only real (negative) eigenvalues ­ the
53 eigenmodes are of the form me-t/m where m is the associated (relaxation) time scale and Mgm is given by the 54 (truncated) convolution

t

55

Mgm(t) := ( s  e-s/n )  g (t) = e-s/n g(t - s) ds.

(S1.9)

0

56 Expression (S1.8) is the common solution to any non-autonomous linear ordinary differential equation. Specifically, 57 the Green function for observable O is given by

M

58

G[O](t) =

m[O]e-t/m ,

(S1.10)

m=1

59 and (S1.8) could alternatively be written as

t

60

O (t) = G[O]  g (t) = G[O](s) g(t - s) ds.

(S1.11)

0

61 As Rj and T (and R) follow (S1.8), j in (S1.6) cannot be a constant (unless M = 1 or in the case the 62 Green functions for Rj and T are identical up to a multiplicative factor).
63 At the same time, (S1.8) invites the study of the system's dynamics per mode. Hence, following (S1.8) we write

M

M

64

Rj(t) =

Rjm(t) :=

m[Rj ] Mgm (t);

(S1.12)

m=1

m=1

M

66

T (t) =

(S1.14)

67

m=1

68 Here, Rjm denotes the feedback contribution for mode m (which thus acts on a timescale m), Rm the complete 69 radiative response at the m-th mode and T m the (global mean surface) temperature at this mode.

70 We propose here to quantify climate feedback strengths per mode. That is, we define the climate feedback 71 parameters m j , which denote the strengths of the j-th feedback at mode m as

72

m j

:=

Rjm(t) T m(t)

=

m[Rj ] Mgm (t) m[T ]Mgm(t)

=

m[Rj ] m[T ]

,

73 and the total feedback parameters m for the full radiative response at mode m as

(S1.15)

74

m

:=

Rm(t) T m(t)

=

m[R]Mgm(t) m[T ]Mgm(t)

=

m[R] m[T ]

.

(S1.16)

75 Similar to the classical definitions of the feedback parameters, per mode the individual feedback parameters should 76 again sum up to the total feedback parameter, i.e. m = jF m j (again small inconsistencies are possible due 77 to ignored higher order and/or interaction terms in (S1.4)).

78 It is also possible to estimate the instantaneous feedback strength of a feedback at time t. For this, the local slope 79 of the graph (T (t), Rj(t)) at time t can be used, which is computed as the fraction of the derivatives, i.e.

80

ijnst(t)

=

Rj (t) T (t)

,

(S1.17)

3

81 where the primes denote derivatives with respect to time.
82 Finally, if the applied forcing is constant (i.e. g(t) = µ(t)  µ) and eigenmodes are decaying over time, this 83 formalism also allows for the estimations of equilibrium feedback strengths j and  as

89 S2 Climate Feedbacks in CESM2 abrupt4xCO2 experiment

90 The above described framework has been applied to CESM2's CMIP6 abrupt4xCO2 model run [Eyring et al., 91 2016]. This run is performed with CESM2 version 2.1.0 (CAM6; CLM5; POP2; MARBL; CICE5.1; CISM2.1) 92 [Danabasoglu et al., 2020]. To compute the feedback contributions Rj(t), radiative kernels made by Pendergrass 93 et al. [2018] with CESM-CAM5 were employed [Pendergrass, 2017a,b]. Computations followed the standard 94 process [Shell et al., 2008, Soden et al., 2008]: radiative kernels were multiplied (per grid cell) with time series for 95 the relevant variable field to obtain location-dependent time series Rj(x, t), from which global mean time series 96 Rj (t) were derived. In this way, we have investigated the following climate feedbacks: (1) Planck feedback, 97 (2) lapse rate feedback, (3) surface albedo feedback, (4) water vapour feedback and (5) cloud feedback. The latter 98 (cloud feedback) has not been computed directly with a radiative kernel, but is indirectly inferred from differences 99 between clearsky and fullsky feedback contributions of the other feedbacks, following Pendergrass et al. [2018], 100 Soden et al. [2008]; more details are given in section S4. In addition, also (global mean) time series T (t) for 101 surface temperature and N (t) for net top-of-atsmophere radiative imbalance have been computed.

So, based 111 on all the time series, values for the time scales m (applying to all observables) and for mode contributions ~m[O] 112 (applying only to observable O) can be found from a fit ­ for a given M . In this study, we have used non-linear 113 least-squares regression for this.

114 S2.1 Global feedback parameters

115 When fitting (S2.2)-(S2.4) to the (global) data, some value for the number of modes M needs to be specified. 116 Since the true amount of modes is unknown, we have tested values up to M = 5 ­ see Figure S1. As M = 3 117 seemed to produce consistent fits with low residuals we have chosen M = 3 for the fits in this study.

118 The thus obtained fits are plotted in Main Text Figure 1 along the data. In Table S1, the values for all fitted
119 parameters are given. From these, the feedback parameters per mode m j , as well as equilibrium values j , have 120 been computed; these are reported on in Main Text Table 1.

121 The instantaneous feedback strengths ijnst(t) for the abrupt4xCO2 can be computed via (S1.17). By (S2.2)-(S2.4),

125 S2.2 Spatial distribution of feedback contributions
126 To study the spatial distribution of the feedback contributions per mode, we consider an extension of equations 127 (S2.2)-(S2.4), in which both the time series and the mode contributions m[O] are considered per spatial location 128 (cf. Proistosescu and Huybers [2017], where similar procedure has been applied to obtain spatial distribution of

Because of the nonlinearity of this regression, found fits can be sensitive to initial guesses.

Blue respectively red bars indicate 5 respectively 95 percentile values, yellow bars denote the mean values and stars give the residual for the best fit of the ensemble.

S3 140 Projections for the 1pctCO2 experiment

141 Expression (S1.8) holds for any (small enough) forcing g. In particular, only Mgm changes when the forcing g 142 changes, while m[O] does not change. Hence, it is possible to determine m[O] from one experiment (i.e. for some 143 forcing g) and use that for projections in case of other forcings. This is a form of linear response theory [Lucarini 144 and Sarno, 2011, Ragone et al., 2016, Ruelle, 2009] that already has been used succesfully in projections of for 145 example ensemble-average warming in global climate models [Aengenheyster et al., 2018, Lembo et al., 2020]. 146 Here, we do not have such ensemble, but nevertheless apply this principle to illustrate its potency in projections 147 of feedback contributions. Specifically, we use the previously found fits for the CESM2 abrupt-4xCO2 experiment 148 to construct projections for its accompanying 1pctCO2 experiment ­ an experiment in which the atmospheric 149 CO2 concentrations are increased by 1% every year. As that experiment has been performed, we can compare 150 the projections to the actual model output. To do so, we have computed feedback contributions Rj and other 151 observables using the same techniques as before with the abrupt-4xCO2 experiment.
152 To relate the response in the abrupt-4xCO2 experiment to the response in the 1pctCO2 experiment, Mgm need 153 to be computed for both experiments. For this, we denote the forcing in the abrupt4xCO2 setting by gabr(t) and 154 in the 1pctCO2 setting by ggrad(t) ­ where `abr' stands for `abrupt' and `grad' for `gradual'.
155 The radiative forcing due to changes in atmospheric CO2 content is related logarithmically . Hence, experienced 156 (change in) forcing g is given by

157

g(t) = A log [c(t)] - A log [c(0)] = A log

c(t) c(0)

,

(S3.1)

158 where A is some constant (according to Myhre et al. [2014], A = 5.35 W m-2 for the effect of CO2 alone, but higher 159 values are also used sometimes to mimic enslaved increase in other greenhouse gases [Aengenheyster et al., 2018]; 160 in any case, the precise value is completely irrelevant for the computations here as it appears as multiplicative 161 constant for all forcings) and where c(t) denotes the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere over time. We note 162 that the formalism presented here also would hold if g was just the atmospheric CO2 concentration, but then 163 the `smallness of forcing' requirement is much stricter, making projections useless in practice (this can be seen 164 `intuitively' by making a Taylor approximation of (S3.1) for small changes in atmospheric CO2).
165 Now, Mgm can be computed straightforwardly. Since cabr(t) = 4c(0), gabr(t) = A log(4) and hence

166

(t)

log(4)m

,

(S3.2)

167 as we found in (S2.1) ­ where µ = A log(4). In the 1pctCO2 scenario, cgrad(t) = c(0) · (1.01)t. Therefore, 168 ggrad(t) = A log(1.01)t and hence

(S3.3)

171

172 With these expressions, projections for the feedback contributions Rj (as well as for warming T and radiative 173 imbalance N ) in the 1pctCO2 experiment can be made. The projections for the globally averaged observables 174 are given in Main Text Figure 3 along with the computed actual values. Spatial projections are also possible; in 175 Figures S10­S17 the spatial projections at t = 140y (at that moment, the amount of CO2 has been quadruppled 176 compared to t = 0) are given along with the actual values and the errors (the spatial distribution for surface 177 albedo feedback also appears as Main Text Figure 4). Movies of the spatial projections over the years are also 178 available.

179 As before, the instantaneous feedback strengths ijnst(t) can be computed. For the 1pctCO2 experiment these are

(S3.4)

182 That is, the intantaneous feedback strength in the gradual setting corresponds to the fraction Rj(t)/T (t) 183 in the abrupt setting1 ­ and hence to the classical feedback strength in that setting, as per (S1.6). A plot of 184 ljoc,grad(t) is shown in Main Text Figure 2

S4 185 Cloud feedback
186 Following Soden et al. [2008], the cloud feedbacks have been derived from differences between clearsky and fullsky 187 feedback contributions of the other feedbacks. As the total radiative response is the sum over all feedback 188 contributions, we have

189

N (t) = F (t) + R(t) = F (t) + Rj(t).

(S4.1)

190

jF

191 Similarly, the clearsky radiative (im)balance constitutes of all feedbacks except for the cloud feedback, i.e.

192

N cs(t) = F cs(t) + Rcs(t) = F cs(t) + Rjcs(t),

(S4.2)

193

jF

194 where the superscript `cs' refers to the clear sky values, F is the set of all feedback mechanisms except for the
195 cloud feedback ­ that does play no role in the clear sky setting ­ and Rjcs(t) is the feedback contribution of the 196 j-th feedback in the clear sky scenario, i.e.

197

Rjcs(t)

:=



N yj

(t).

(S4.3)

198 Upon using the tautology N (t) = N cs(t) + [N (t) - N cs(t)], (S4.1) and (S4.2) can be used to obtain

199

F cs(t) + Rjcs(t) + [N (t) - N cs(t)] = F (t) + Rj(t) + Rcloud(t).

(S4.4)

jF

jF

200 Rearranging these terms yields the cloud feedback contribution

201

Rcloud(t) = [N (t) - N cs(t)] + [F cs(t) - F (t)] +

Rjcs(t) - Rj(t) .

(S4.5)

jF

202 Because the radiative forcings F (t) and F cs(t) cannot be obtained from model output like N (t), N cs(t),
203 Rj(t) and Rjcs(t), their values need to be derived from fits instead. Hence, in the fits we use the following 204 expression:

M

[N (t) - N cs(t)]+

Rjcs(t) - Rj(t) = [F (t) - F cs(t)]+RCloud(t) = [F (t) - F cs(t)]+ m[cloud]Mm(t).
