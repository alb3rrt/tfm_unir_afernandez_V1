Abstract
Gravity shapes liquids and play a crucial role in their internal balance. Creating new equilibrium configurations irrespective of the presence of a gravitational field is challenging with applications on earth as well as in zero-gravity environments. Vibrations are known to alter the shape of liquid interfaces and to also to change internal dynamics and stability in depth. Here, we show that vibrations can also create an "artificial gravity" in any direction. We demonstrate that a liquid can maintain an inclined interface when shaken in an arbitrary direction. A necessary condition for the equilibrium to occur is the existence of a velocity gradient determined by dynamical boundary conditions. However, no-slip boundary condition and incompressibility can perturb the required velocity profile leading to a destabilization of the equilibrium. We show that liquid layers provide a solution and liquid walls of several centimeters in height can thus be stabilized. We show that the buoyancy equilibrium is not affected by the forcing.

Vibrations can have a dramatic effect on a fluid equilibrium inducing a slow global reorientation of the fluid toward a new quasi-static equilibrium. Faraday was the first to observe this phenomenon called vibro-equilibrium in 1831 with the flattening of a droplet submitted to vertical vibrations1. Since then, the effects of vibrations on the shape and stability of liquid interfaces have been studied in various configurations2,3. In the case of vertical oscillations, it can lead either to stabilization as for upside-down interfaces with the suppression of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability2,4,5 or to instability with the parametric excitation of waves (Faraday instability)1,6,7. In the horizontal direction, the interface shape differ from the unforced equilibrium with the excitation of frozen-like waves2,8,9. Vibroequilibria and interface stabilization have been analyzed starting from its solid analog with the Kapitza's pendulum model10. This approach is based on the decoupling of the dynamics into a fast motion at the vibration frequency and a slow time-averaged motion. Various variational approaches with functionals including terms associated with potential energy as well as vibrational energy also have been developed to obtain a more precise description of the shape of the interface11­14.
Beyond shaping the liquid interface, vibrations have also a strong effect on the dynamics and equilibria taking place inside the fluids or heterogeneous systems. It has been shown that vibrations can promote mixing and favor chemical reactions15,16, induce Bjerknes forces17 on bubbles and immersed bodies18­23 or stabilize upside-down buoyancy equilibria24.
In most typical situations, the effect of vibrations is negligible compared to the more familiar effects of gravity. Many studies have thus been performed in microgravity25. Beyond interface modifications, vibrations induce changes in the fluid dynamics creating an "artificial gravity" in space26­29.
Here, we investigate the ability for strong vibrations to create a controlled "artificial gravity" in an arbitrary direction in the presence of gravitation. We show that slanted liquid interfaces can be stabilized in all directions. The vertical pressure gradients due to gravity are balanced by a kinematic pressure term created by a velocity gradient at the interface. Tilted liquid baths are limited by volume conservation while liquid walls surrounded by compressible air layers can be stabilized by lifting this non-compressibility constraint. Buoyancy equilibria are recovered on each interface.
The experimental setup is composed of a plexiglass container mounted on an electromagnetic shaker. The whole system can be rotated freely to change the angle of the excitation  to the

vertical axis. All the experiments were performed with silicon oil with dynamic viscosity  = 1000 cSt and density  = 920 kg/m3.

The liquid is silicon oil with dynamic viscosity  = 1000 cSt and its height is  = 3.4 cm. The forcing is at frequency /2 = 100 Hz and velocity amplitude exc = 1.4 m.s-1. b, Angle  between the liquid interface to the forcing direction (inset) as a function of the excitation angle  for two liquid depths  = 3.8 cm (red crosses) and  = 5.8 cm (blue circles) with the same forcing. The error bars were evaluated experimentally at ±2°.

We first study the influence of the excitation angle on the liquid vibroequilibrium. Figure 1a

velocity amplitude exc = 1.4 m/s. The liquid interface is approximately flat and can be

characterized by its average angle  between the normal to the interface and the direction of

vibration (Fig. 1b). This angle is slowly increasing from  = 0 in the standard upright position

( = 0°) to approximately  = 20° at the angle  = 100° for which the liquid interface is

approximately vertical. Upon further increasing the excitation angle, the interface destabilizes,

leading to the fall of the liquid. However, since it takes a finite time for the liquid to destabilize,

it is possible to explore higher angles  by a fast rotation the container. An equilibrium is

recovered above ~130° up to the upside-down position ( = 180°). The angle  decreases

in this interval from 20° to 0°. The variation of  is independent of the liquid depth for

sufficient large depths (Fig. 1b).

When an equilibrium is observed, the vibration induces a reorientation of the liquid toward a new quasi-static equilibrium. The periodic oscillations at the liquid surface set by the forcing frequency on the fast timescale drive a slower reorientation of the fluid toward a new quasisteady equilibrium distinct from the hydrostatic one oriented toward the direction of the excitation30. This resemble the Kapitza's pendulum for which a pendulum is vibrated vertically and stabilized in the upside-down position with, in this case, a forcing in an arbitrary direction . The dynamic of the pendulum can also be separated in two time scales10. The angle  between the pendulum of angular frequency 0 and the forcing direction  when shaken with a velocity exc() = exccos() in the direction  can be written as the sum of a fast component f at the forcing frequency and a slow averaged one s. For a strong forcing,  takes the simple following form (see general case in Supplementary Information)

The

observed

experimental solution results from a slow variation of . The analog of the pendulum's angular frequency 0 for the liquid must be determined. The scaling should be 0~/i with i being the characteristic length of the fluid interface. For small eq, i~ taking the expression given by the wave dispersion relation 0~/. This value gives a very good agreement with the measured angles eq as a function of the excitation direction  without any fitting parameter (Fig. 1b). In addition, the variations of eq with the forcing velocity exc for a horizontal excitation ( = 90°) also agrees very well with the model (Fig. 1c). Upon increasing the excitation, the fluid surface reorient itself in the orthogonal direction. In the case of the pendulum, the equilibrium is stable if 12 > 0 and only inverted pendulums (cos  < 0) can be unstable. The instability increases with the increasing downward direction but all directions can be stabilized upon sufficient forcing above a critical speed K~2/. In liquid analog, the instability also occurs for inverted interfaces but the stabilization is recovered in the lower inverted quadrant ( > 130°)24,31.

container of width  = 5 cm shaken in the horizontal direction (Supplementary Video 3). The

time interval between 2 snapshots lasts several seconds. The liquid reaches a final symmetric

vibro-equilibrium state shown in the last snapshot.

In contrast to rigid pendulums, the forcing must also ensure the equilibrium of the interface in the liquid case. The slanted liquid interface must be stabilized. Figure 2a shows a typical snapshot of the liquid vibrated horizontally. It is possible to extract the fast dynamics of the interface profile in the oscillating frame (Fig. 2b). The interface undergoes a global oscillation at the excitation frequency locked in phase with the forcing. The lower part of the interface being -shifted while the upper part is in phase with a fixed point just below the middle of the interface's height. By observing the motion of small particles, the velocity near the interface is found to be mostly normal to the surface (Supplementary Videos 2 and 3). In the lab frame, the amplitude of the velocity exp() at the forcing frequency can thus be deduced by simply looking at the motion of the interface. This amplitude is increasing with the height  (Fig. 2c). At the boundaries, a no-slip condition imposes an inversion of the velocity gradient over a boundary layer of a few millimeters. The presence of Faraday waves in the upper part of the interface is a signature of the higher velocity amplitude as the instability threshold is crossed (Fig. 1a). The same type of velocity profiles are observed for all the liquid equilibria with slanted interfaces whatever the excitation direction.

The stability of the slanted interface can be understood by the inhomogeneous velocity amplitude along the interface which provides a kinetic potential to counteract the hydrostatic equilibrium. This dynamical term appears by writing that the pressure should be constant at the interface. The correlation between the fast oscillating pressure in the fluid and the interface

motion generates an extra stabilizing term that depends on the interface velocity8. In the large forcing regime, the equilibrium satisfies (Supplementary Information)

with <. > being the time averaging operation over the forcing period of the instantaneous velocity (, ) at time  and height . The velocity amplitude at the forcing frequency thus satisfies B() = exc1 + 4( - 0)/e2xc with 0 being a fixed point in the container's frame. The position of the fixed point is given by the constraint imposed by volume conservation. In addition, because of the non-slip condition at the interface, the velocity profile must be modified near the walls. Using the Stokes equation in the co-moving frame for the boundary layer (Supplementary Information), we obtain the velocity profile plotted in Fig. 2c which is in good agreement with the experimental one. This analysis yields a critical excitation velocity for a given interface height required by the existence of a minimum velocity along the entire profile.

It is interesting to compare this result with the one obtained from Kapitza's pendulum. In this

latter case, the pendulum is oscillating at the forcing frequency around an equilibrium position

eq. For an intense forcing (cos   e22xc2 02), the instantaneous velocity K(, ) along a plane

orthogonal to the pendulum coincident with that of the liquid interface satisfies K(, ) = K cos  with K = exc + 2( - 0)/exc and 0 = /2 (Supplementary Information).

Figure 2c shows the linear profile associated to the average value of the velocity with Stokes-

type linking for the non-slip condition to the boundaries in the case of a horizontal shaking.

This profile is in good agreement with the experimental data. It corresponds to the first-order

approximation of the non-linear velocity profile deduced from the boundary condition at the

interface. The velocity gradient results from the phase-locked oscillation of the pendulum with

its forcing motion. Figure 2d shows the various contributions to the pressure along the interface

At the bottom of the interface the model imposes B < exc from volume conservation while the no-slip boundary condition imposes B = exc at the wall. As a result, the velocity gradient along the interface changes sign (Fig. 2c), breaking the equilibrium condition. The liquid is drained slowly at the lower interface in the shape of a liquid finger of a few millimeters in

height (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Video 3). Hence, interface effects produce an unstable range of excitation angles around 100° <  < 130°. Surface tension provides a stabilizing effect on the liquid drainage over the capillary length size at the interface. The drainage seems to be triggered when the typical width of the inversed velocity gradient layer exceeds the capillary length. This agrees with the observed instability angles  for which the height of the liquid interface is the largest. Hence, in contrast to solid pendulums, the stability of vibrated liquids is hindered by non-slip boundary effects in forcing directions associated to the largest liquid heights.

Video 5). Because of the presence of Faraday waves and of the inward meniscus orientation,

the interface profiles were approximated by linear fits. Taking into account the non-slip

condition modifies the velocity amplitude profile at the boundary (colored dashed lines). e,

The destabilizing change of sign of the velocity gradient at the boundary is imposed by volume conservation which is a consequence of the non-compressibility of the liquid. A liquid layer with compressible air on both sides can alleviate this constraint. Such liquid layers can be obtained by injecting air with a needle at the bottom of a vibrating container filled with liquid. Since bubbles can sink into a shaken liquid, an air cushion can be created to support the liquid18­ 21,24. This liquid layer appears stable for all the excitation angles when the shaker is rotated (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Video 4). The measured tilt angles of the two interfaces 1 and 2 as a function of the excitation angle  (Fig. 3b) show the same symmetric smooth shape increasing in absolute value from zero at  = 0° to a maximum value at  = 90° and decreasing back to zero at  = 180°. Note that the stability of the liquid layer is increased experimentally by closing the two sides of the container with just one pinhole for the injection needle to pass through. The two compressible air layers act as springs to excite the liquid layer which has a resulting average velocity liq that can be significantly larger than that of the container itself24. For the dataset shown in Fig. 3, we measured exc = 0.45 m/s and liq = 1.0 m/s.
Due to the relaxation of the volume conservation in the air layers, the liquid layer can now undergo some deformation during an excitation period which make the analogy with a solid pendulum less pertinent. The variations of  with the excitation direction  are similar to that of the filled container for the stable excitation directions (Fig. 1). However, the amplitudes of the tilt angles appear much smaller in the former case, even if liq > exc is taken into account

for the forcing. The velocity profile should still satisfies the dynamical equation (2) to fulfill the stability condition of the liquid interface. The interface motion can be obtained from side views of a vertical liquid layer of 5 cm in height shaken horizontally (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Video 5). To obtain the velocity profile exp(), each interface profile is approximated by a linear fit due to the presence of the Faraday waves in the upper part and to the inward meniscus orientation which prevent a more detailed analysis (see solid lines in Fig. 3d). The non-slip condition at each boundary is again taken into account with Stokes equations (colored dashed lines). The velocity amplitude exp() of liquid walls is found always higher than the velocity amplitude of the container exc (dashed lines). In addition, the velocity profile increases continuously up to the upper boundary layer insuring the stability of the layer. Note that the two interfaces have nearly equal velocity profiles as expected from the incompressibility of the liquid layer.

Pressure contributions along the interface as a function of the height  (Fig 3e) show that the

sum of the hydrostatic pressure w =  and the experimental dynamic pressure dyn =

1 2

(exp()/2)2

is

approximately

constant

as

needed

at

equilibrium.

Unlike

the

filled

container case, the pressure stability is now insured by the absence of inversion of the velocity

gradient profile exp() in the lowest boundary. The presence of a compressible air layer in

liquid walls is necessary to achieve this pressure stability.

Dashed lines represent the expected immersed

It has been previously shown that vertical shaking could stabilize unstable equilibrium positions of objects floating upside-down24. How does shaking affects the buoyancy equilibrium in an arbitrary direction? For a filled container, the floating position is measured as a function of the excitation angle  for 1.5 cm-diameter spheres of various weights (see snapshots Fig. 4a and Supplementary Video 6). The immersed part of the sphere remains unperturbed for a given object density as the shaking is rotated (Fig. 4b) showing that the buoyancy equilibrium is not changed by the forcing and remains normal to the iso-pressure interface. Note that secondary flows in the liquid have a slight influence on the transverse position of the floaters which tend to drift slowly into preferred positions. The floating objects behave as if a gravitational force of constant amplitude was exerted perpendicular to the liquid surface whatever the excitation direction. The shaking thus creating a new vibro-equilibrium in a sort of "artificial gravity" induced by the dynamic energy provided by the shaking. Hence, in this environment, surfer toys can surf on a customized stable wave (Supplementary Video 7). Vibrations can create new dynamical equilibria in an arbitrary direction in which the effect of gravity can be neglected. This offer new opportunities to control more complex interactions and for new unexplored configurations involving fluid mixture dynamics, in zero gravity environments or more complex multiphase systems.

1 Summary
We aim to explain quantitatively the experimental results presented in the main text. We first model our system as a semi-circular solid pendulum shaken in an arbitrary direction. The velocity of the liquid interface will be identified with the velocity of the flat part of the pendulum. This model reproduces with good agreement all experimental data. Moreover, we show that the velocity found in our solid approach can be interpreted as an equilibrium condition for a free liquid interface. In the compressible case, the solid approach could not be carried as the liquid slab is now deformable but the dynamic equilibrium condition still holds. We will also discuss the velocity near the walls as the boundary layer plays a major role in our system.
The supplementary material is organized as follow. In §2, we briefly rederive the equilibrium positions of a shaken pendulum. The §3 is dedicated to the mapping of the liquid on the equivalent semi-circular solid and to the introduction of notations. In particular, we give the correspondence between the quantities introduced in §2 and the quantity measured experimentally . We then derive in §4 the velocity field in the solid pendulum. Boundary layers are introduced in §5 as a perturbation of the velocity profile found for the solid. In §6, we compute the velocity of the interface starting from Navier-Stokes equation. When linearized, this expression is shown to be consistent with the velocity profile found in §4.

There are two equilibrium positions. If we set  = 0 the equilibrium positions are = 0 (hanging pendulum, n = 0) and =  (inverted pendulum, n = 1). In our experiments, we slowly vary  and start with = 0. For each angle, we can only observe the equilibrium that corresponds to n = 0 as observing the

3 Mapping on the fluid interface experiment
3.1 Correspondance of variables
We want to link the angles of the pendulum (eq, ) with the angles defined for the fluid in the main text (, ). We first have  =  (see figure 2). Concerning , we see figure 2 that we have  = -eq. This angle is zero when the interface is orthogonal to the shaking and is slightly positive otherwise.

In order to make an analogy with a pendulum, we need to compute the

equivalent 0 of the effective pendulum. For an horizontal interface, we know

that the largest mode on an interface of length L has a pulsation

2g L

.

This

has no reason to be valid for a non-horizontal interface. However, if we now

consider our mass of fluid as a rotating half disk of mass m around it center,

The main difference is that this model takes into account the motion of masses of liquids (sloshing) while the wave dispersion only takes into account surface deformation. Assuming rotation around point O ensures that the volume of fluid will be conserved.
Although the scaling of 0  g/L seems reasonable, the prefactor can be adjusted. In everything that follows we take 0 = g/L to give it a wave equivalent. This value ensures good agreement between experimental results and predictions.

3.2 Notations
The velocity in the lab frame is noted v(z, t) = V (z) sin (t), the velocity in the co-moving frame is noted v(z, t) = V (z) sin (t) and the velocity in the boundary layer in the co-moving frame is noted vb(z, t) = Vb(z) sin (t)

4 Velocity profile of the interface

We are now interested in the velocity of the interface. We take a point J such that in the co-moving frame OJ = z ~e. We have in the co-moving frame

v(z, t) = -z ~er

(11)

We know that  = s + f . From equation 4 we get

f

=

 02 

sin (t) sin ( -

s)

(12)

Moreover we assume that the equilibrium for slow variables is reached so that  s  0. Thus we get that in the co-moving frame

We have seen in the previous section that the velocity is at first order aligned
with the excitation, that means ~er  e. We will also use complex variables as our equations will be linear. Any velocity will take the form v(z, t) = V (z)eite. For instance the velocity at the interface found in equation 14 now writes

v(z, t) = V (z)eite

Due to symmetry, all variables are assumed to depend on z (and t) only. If we assume non-slip boundary condition at the walls, the velocity should verify

V (z = ±L/2) = -a0

(16)

Clearly the velocity V (z) does not verify this condition (see figure 3). We will perturb it near the wall to satisfy this condition. The spatial extension of the

perturbation should be of the order of  =

2 

 2 mm.

In this boundary

layer, the flow vb should follow Stokes equation with boundary conditions

vb t

=

vb

-

1 P


vb(z = ±L/2) = -a0eite

(17)

vb(|z ± L/2| >> ) = V (z)eite.

The last conditions indicates that the velocity at a distance d >>  from the

wall is simply the unperturbed velocity. Over a few , the velocity V (z) can

be considered as a constant (see figure 3).

The

profile near the wall.

To solve equation 17 we use superposition principle. We first consider the

flow

v

V (±L/2)eite.

As

v

the

reads

these new variables obey the system

P^ = 0

wb t

(18)

wb(±L/2) = -V (±L/2)eite

wb(|z ± L/2| >> )  0.

where we used for the last condition that V(z) is approximately constant in the

boundary layer. The solution to this equation is (writing wb(z, t) = Wb(z)eite

)

Wb

(21)

where

We

that

previous section. In contrary, at z = ±L/2 the velocity is -a0 that is exactly the velocity of the container.

6 Equilibrium condition from Navier-Stokes equation

We now propose to write the equilibrium condition at the free interface of a vibrated liquid. We will assume that the forcing is horizontal so that e = ex. We start from Navier-Stokes equation in the comoving frame of velocity -a0 sin (t)ex that writes

p(x, h(x, t)) = Patm

(23)

where vn is the velocity normal to the surface and Patm is the atmospheric pressure. This holds providing we neglect capillary effect and variation of pressure in the air layer. We will expand the quantities in the same manner as in reference [8]. We assume that a << a << a2 and that a2 >> g. We define the different time scales as

t-1 = t

t0 = t

(24)

t1 = t/...

22

and we expand all quantities as

p = p-1(t-1, t0, ...) + p0(t-1, t0, ...) + ...

1

h = h0(t-1, t0, ...) +  h1(t-1, t0, ...)

(25)

Inserting these variables in eq. 22 gives at leading order in 

v

1

t-1 = -  p-1 + a0 cos (t-1)ex

(26)

suggesting that all quantities oscillates with respect to t-1. Writing v = V (t0) sin (t-1) + u(t0) and p-1 = P-1(t0) cos (t-1) we get

P-1 = - V  - a0ex = -V

(27)

Hence at leading order the pressure gradient is linked to the velocity in the laboratory frame V . The term u corresponds to slow flow compared to . As
we are looking for equilibrium solutions for large times, we will assume that u = 0 so that we have v = V (t0) sin (t-1).
We now take the next leading order of equation 22 and get

v.v

By taking the rotational of eq. 27 we show that  × v = 0. The non linear

cos (t) + p0(x, h0) = Patm - C

(34)

At first order we get p-1(x, h0) = C-1. This conditions forces the gradient of

pressure in the direction tangent to the interface to be zero. This gives using

equation 27

V .t = 0

(35)

At the interface, the velocity amplitude can then simply be written

V = V (x, y)n

(36)

We have

with

surface

is

n

=

- cos ex + sin ey

and

h0 x

= 1/ tan .

We finally need the

components of the velocity field that are

V = V (- cos ex + sin ey)

Vy = sin V

V  = a0ex + V Vx = a0 - V cos

Vy = sin V

V 2 = Vx2 + Vy2

In the limit of large forcing, we expect  << 1 so that Vx2  V 2. In order to conserve volume we impose V (x)dx = 0. We deduce that there is at least one point x0 such that V (x0) = 0 since V  is expected to be continuous. We evaluate the previous expression at this point to get the constant Patm - C = -gh0(x0) = -gy0. From this we finally get

V (V  - 2a0) = 4g(y - y0)

(40)

sin ( - eq).

At first order in

 - eq this is exactly the equilibrium condition 6. In the limit of large forcing,

the velocity found in the solid case can be interpreted as the velocity of the

interface satisfying the equilibrium condition.

Note that since V 2 = (a0 - V )2 = a202 + V (V  - 2a0) the condition

40 can also be written

V 2 = a202 + 4g(y - y0)

(43)

The point y0 being determined by the volume conservation condition. This gives

V (y) = a202 + 4g(y - y0)

(44)

as long as a202 > 4g(y - y0). Thus the maximum height that can be stabilized is related to the forcing velocity.
