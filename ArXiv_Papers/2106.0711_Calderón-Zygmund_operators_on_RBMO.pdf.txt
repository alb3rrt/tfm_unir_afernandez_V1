CALDERO´ N­ZYGMUND OPERATORS ON RBMO
EVGUENI DOUBTSOV AND ANDREI V. VASIN
Abstract. Let µ be an n-dimensional finite positive measure on Rm. We obtain a T 1 condition sufficient for the boundedness of Caldero´n­Zygmund operators on RBMO(µ), the regular BMO space of Tolsa.

1. Introduction
Given a positive Radon measure µ on Rm, Tolsa [6] introduced RBMO(µ), the regular BMO space with respect to µ. This space is suitable for the non-doubling measures µ and it has genuine properties of the classical space BMO such as the John­Nirenberg inequality. Moreover, it is proved in [6] that a bounded on L2(µ) Calder´on­Zygmund operator maps L(µ) into RBMO(µ). Motivated by this result, we consider Calder´on­Zygmund operators on RBMO(µ): we obtain a T1 condition sufficient for the boundedness of Calder´on­Zygmund operators on RBMO(µ); see Section 1.4 for a precise formulation.

1.1. Cubes and n-dimensional measures. In what follows, a cube is a closed cube in Rm with sides parallel to the axes and centered at a point of supp µ. For
a cube Q, let  = (Q) denote its side-length. Also the notation Q(x, ) is used to
indicate explicitly the center x of the cube under consideration. As in [6], we always assume that µ is an n-dimensional measure on Rm for a real
number n, 0 < n  m. By definition, it means that

(1.1)

µ(Q)  Cn(Q) for any cube Q  Rm, (Q) > 0,

with a universal constant C > 0.

1.2. Calder´on­Zygmund operators. Let d(·, ·) denote the standard distance between points of Rm. A Calder´on­Zygmund kernel associated with an n-dimensional measure µ on Rm is a measurable function K(x, y) on Rm × Rm \ {(x, x) : x  Rm}
satisfying the following conditions:

(1.2)

|K(x, y)|  Cd-n(x, y),

(1.3)

|K(x1, y) - K(x2, y)| + |K(y, x1) - K(y, x2)|



C

d(x1, x2) dn+(x1, y)

,

2d(x1, x2)  d(x1, y),

(1.4)

K(x, y) dµ(x)  C, 0 < r < R,
Q(x,R)\Q(x,r)

where C > 0 is a universal constant and , 0 <   1, is a regularity constant specific to the kernel K.

Remark 1. Restrictions (1.2) and (1.3) are standard. Condition (1.4) is a more special cancellation property.

The Calder´on-Zygmund operator associated to the kernel K(x, y) and the measure µ is defined as
T f (x) = K(x, y)f (y) dµ(y)
Rm
for x / supp(f µ). So, in the general setting, one introduces the following truncated operators T,  > 0:

Tf (x) =

K(x, y)f (y) dµ(y).

Rm \Q(x,)

The operator T is said to be bounded on Lp(µ) if the operators T are bounded on Lp(µ) uniformly in  > 0.

1.3. Regular BMO space. In this section, we give an equivalent definition of RBMO(µ), the regular BMO space introduced by Tolsa [6].

1.3.1. Coefficients K(Q, R). Given two cubes Q  R in Rm, put

K (Q,

R)

=

1

+

NQ,R

µ(2j Q) n (2j Q)

,

j=1

where NQ,R is the minimal integer k such that (2kQ)  (R). Clearly, K(Q, R)  1. On the other hand, K(Q, R) is bounded above by C log((R)/(Q)) because µ is n-dimensional.

1.3.2. Doubling cubes.
Definition 1. Let  > 1 and  > n. A cube Q is called (, )-doubling if
µ(Q) < µ(Q).
Let µ be a Radon measure on Rm and  > 1. As indicated in [6], it is known that for a sufficiently large  = (, n), for µ-almost all x  Rm there is a sequence of (, )-doubling cubes {Qk} k=1 centered at x and with (Qk) tending to 0 as k  . Let n denote two times the infimum of the corresponding constants (4, n).
Definition 2. A cube Q  Rm is called doubling if Q is (4, n)-doubling.
Remark 2. The original definition of a doubling cube and further results in [6] are given for  = 2 and under assumption 1  n  m. Nevertheless, it is known that the results of Tolsa [6] are extendable to larger values of  and for 0 < n  m; see, for example, [4] for a generalization of this theory for a wide class of measures on appropriate metric spaces. So, in what follows, we use the above definition with  = 4 and still refer to original results of Tolsa [6].

1.3.3. Definition of RBMO.

Definition 3. The space RBMO(µ) consists of those f  L1loc(µ) for which there exists a constant CE > 0 and a collection of constants {fQ} (one constant for each
doubling cube Q  Rm) such that

(1.5) and

1 µ(Q)

|f - fQ| dµ  CE
Q

(1.6)

|fQ - fR|  CEK(Q, R)

for all doubling cubes Q, R, Q  R. Let f = f E denote the infimum of the corresponding constants CE > 0.

Standard arguments guarantee that · is a norm on the space RBMO(µ) modulo constants.

1.4. Main theorem. Suppose that a Calder´on-Zygmund operator T is bounded on L2(µ). Then, as mentioned above, T maps L(µ) boundedly into RBMO(µ). Moreover, in the classical situation of homogeneous metric spaces and under addi-
tional assumption T 1 = 0, the operator T is known to be bounded on BMO type
spaces; see, for example, [5, Ch. 4, Sect. 4]. In the present paper, we obtain a T 1 condition sufficient for the boundedness of T on RBMO(µ).
Given a cube Q  Rm, put

K(Q) = K(Q, 2kQ),

where

k

is

the

smallest

positive

integer

such

that

µ(2k Q)

>

1 2

µ(Rm).

Theorem 1.1. Let µ be a finite positive n-dimensional measure on Rm. Let T be a Calder´on­Zygmund operator bounded on L2(µ). Assume that for each doubling

cube Q  Rm, there exists a constant bQ such that

(1.7)

1 µ(Q)

Q

|T 1

-

bQ| dµ



C K (Q)

for all doubling cubes Q

and (1.8)

|bQ

-

bR|



C

K(Q, R) K (Q)

for all doubling cubes Q, R, Q  R,

where the constant C > 0 does not depend on Q and R. Then T is bounded on RBMO(µ).

Remark 3. We say that T is bounded on RBM O(µ) if the operators T,  > 0, are uniformly bounded on RBM O(µ). Also, (1.7) and (1.8) similarly mean that these estimates hold for T uniformly in  > 0.
Remark 4. We implicitly assume in Theorem 1.1 that T 1  L(µ). Indeed, this property follows from (1.4); see Lemma 2.5. If T 1 is a constant, then Theorem 1.1 clearly guarantees that T is bounded on RBMO(µ).

Remark 5. Property (1.7) is, in a sense, similar to the oscillation condition used in [1], where a T 1 theorem for BMOH in the Hermite-Calder´on-Zygmund setting is obtained.

The final step in the proof of Theorem 1.1 uses · only; however, the following semi-norm on RBMO(µ) is crucial for certain auxiliary results.

4

EVGUENI DOUBTSOV AND ANDREI V. VASIN

Definition 4. Let f  L1loc(µ). Fix a constant  > 1. Let f A, denote the infimum of the constants CA = CA, > 0 with the following properties: for each
cube Q, there exists fQ  R such that

(1.9)

sup
Q

1 µ(Q)

|f (x) - fQ| dµ(x)  CA,
Q

(1.10)

|fQ - fR|  CAK(Q, R) for any two cubes Q  R.

Remark 6. The original semi-norm on RBMO(µ) from [6] is different from those introduced in Definitions 3 and 4. Nevertheless, all these semi-norms are equivalent; see Section 2 for further details.

1.5. Notation. As usual, the symbol C denotes an absolute constant whose value can vary from line to line. Notation CA, CB, etc. is used in certain specific situations.

1.6. Organization of the paper. Auxiliary results are presented in Section 2. Section 3 is devoted to estimates related to the main technical decomposition of functions from RBMO; equivalence of Definitions 3 and 4 is essential on this step. The proof of Theorem 1.1 is given in Section 4.

2. Auxiliary results

2.1. Equivalent definitions of RBMO. As mentioned in the introduction, Defi-
nition 3 is not the original one for RBMO(µ) in [6]. In the present section, we show
that Definition 3 and the definitions of the regular BMO from [6] are equivalent. Firstly, recall several notions introduced by Tolsa [6]. Let  > 1 and f  L1loc(µ).
Given a cube Q  Rm, let f Q denote the standard µ-average of f over Q, that is,

f

Q

=

1 µ(Q)

f dµ.
Q

· Let f B, denote the infimum of the constants CB = CB, > 0 with the following properties:

1 µ(Q)

|f - f Q|dµ  CB for any cube Q (centered at some point of supp(µ)),
Q

| f Q - f R|  CBK(Q, R) for any two doubling cubes Q  R,

where Q denotes the smallest doubling cube in the sequence Q, 4Q, 42Q, . . . .

Remark 7. The original definition of Q in [6] uses the sequence Q, 2Q, 22Q, . . . . The
present definition of Q is based on  = 4; related details are given in Definition 2 and Remark 2. See also [4] for similar definitions with  > 1.

· Let f C, denote the infimum of the constants CC = CC, > 0 with the following properties: for any cube Q

|f - f Q| dµ  CCµ(Q),
Q
| f Q - f R|  CCK(Q, R)

µ(Q) µ(Q)

+

µ(R) µ(R)

for any two cubes Q  R.

CALDERO´ N­ZYGMUND OPERATORS ON RBMO

· Let f D denote the infimum of the constants CD > 0 with the following properties:

(2.1) and

|f - f Q| dµ  CDµ(Q) for any doubling cube Q
Q

(2.2)

| f Q - f R|  CDK(Q, R) for any two doubling cubes Q  R.

The property f B, <  is used to define the regular BMO space in [6]. By [6, Lemma 2.6], the norms · A, are equivalent for different  > 1; by [6, Lemma 2.8],
· B, and · A, are equivalent. By [6, Lemma 2.10], · C, and · D are equivalent to · B,.
Standard arguments show that Definition 3 and the property f D <  define the same space, with equivalent norms. Indeed, if f D < , then trivially f  RBMO(µ) with CE = f D. Now, assume that f  RBMO(µ). Property (1.5) guarantees that
| f Q - fQ|  CE
for any doubling Q. Hence, (1.5) implies (2.1) with CD = 2CE; (1.6) implies (2.2) with CD = 3CE. Therefore, · D and · E are equivalent.
In the arguments related to the proof of Theorem 1.1, we will use · A,. Thus, for further reference, we separately formulate a particular conclusion from the above arguments as the following lemma.

Lemma 2.1. Given a constant  > 1, · A, is an equivalent norm on the space RBMO(µ) modulo constants.

2.2. John­Nirenberg inequality for RBMO. Tolsa [6] proved the following version of the John­Nirenberg inequality for RBMO.

Theorem 2.2 (see [6, Theorem 3.1]). Let f  RBMO(µ),  > 1, and let {bQ}Q be a collection of numbers satisfying

sup
Q

1 µ(Q)

|f (x) - bQ| dµ(x)  C f B,
Q

|bQ - bR|  CK(Q, R) f B,

for any two cubes Q  R, with an absolute constant C > 0. Then for any cube Q and any  > 0, we have

µ{x  Q : |f (x) - bQ| > }  CJN µ(Q) exp

-cJN  f B,

with CJN , cJN > 0 depending on .

We will need the following corollary related to Definition 4.

Lemma 2.3. Let 1 < p <  and f  RBMO(µ),  > 1. Let {fQ}Q be such numbers that (1.9) and (1.10) hold with CA = 2 f A,. Then

2.3. Properties of RBMO.

Lemma 2.4. Let µ be a finite n-dimensional measure, f  RBMO(µ),  > 1, and let {fQ}Q be numbers such that (1.9) and (1.10) hold with CA = 2 f A, < . Then
|fQ|  Cf K(Q) for all cubes Q  Rm,
where the number Cf > 0 does not depend on Q.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume that µ(Rm) = 1. Fix a cube Q1 such that (Q1)  1 and µ(Q1) > 0. Put

C1(f ) = |fQ1 |.

Firstly,

let

Q2

be

a

such

that

Select a cube Q3 such that

Q3  Q1  Q2. By the choice of fQj , j = 1, 2, 3,

|fQ2 |  |fQ2 - fQ3 | + |fQ3 - fQ1 | + |fQ1 |  2K(Q2, Q3) f A, + 2K(Q1, Q3) f A, + C1(f ).

Since µ is n-dimensional, we have (Q2)   > 0. Hence,

Let k be the smallest

2.4. Estimates of T 1.

by (1.8). The proof of the lemma is finished.

3. Main construction
Let T be a Calder´on-Zygmund operator bounded on L2(µ). Let f  RBMO(µ),  = 2. Using Definition 4, for each cube Q  Rm, select a number f2Q such that (1.5) and (1.6) hold with CA, = 2 f A, and with 2Q in the place of Q. In particular, the assumptions of Lemma 2.3 are satisfied. Also, to explain further arguments and estimates, it is worth mentioning that 2Q is not necessarily doubling even if Q is a doubling cube.

EVGUENI DOUBTSOV AND ANDREI V. VASIN

In the present section, we give estimates related to the following functions:

f1 = f1,Q = f2Q, f2 = f2,Q = (f - f2Q)2Q, f3 = f3,Q = (f - f2Q)Rm\2Q.

Observe that

f = f1 + f2 + f3.

This decomposition ascends to [3]; see also [2].

Let b2,Q = 0 and

b3,Q

=

1 µ(Q)

T f3,Q(y) dµ(y).
Q

In the following lemma, we assume that Q is a doubling cube.

Lemma 3.1. There exists a constant C > 0 such that

1 µ(Q)

|T fk - bk,Q| dµ  C f ,
Q

k = 2, 3,

for any doubling cube Q.

Proof. Put

k = 2, 3.

For k = 2, we have

In the following lemma, the cubes under consideration are not assumed to be doubling. However, in the proof of Theorem 1.1, we apply this lemma in the doubling setting.
Lemma 3.2. There exists a constant C > 0 such that
|bk,Q - bk,R|  C f K(Q, R), k = 2, 3.
for any two cubes Q  R.
Proof. For k = 2, the required estimate is trivial; so assume that k = 3. Given cubes Q  R, we have
|b3,Q - b3,R|  |b3,Q - b3,Q0 | + |b3,Q0 - b3,R| = I + J,
where Q0 = 2kQ and k is the minimal integer such that 2kQ  R.

Combining (3.1­3.5) and integrating with respect to z and y, we obtain the required estimate for I = |b3,Q - b3,Q0|. Therefore, it remains to estimate J.
We have

By the definitions of f3,Q0 and f3,R,

Now, we estimate F . Property (1.3) guarantees that

We have

Hence, using dyadic decompositions and summation by parts, we repeat the arguments applied to estimate |F | and we obtain the following analog of (3.4) and (3.5):

(3.9)

|F |  C f .

Now, combining estimates (3.6­3.9), we conclude that

J = |b3,Q - b3,R|  CK(Q, R) f

for any two cubes Q  R. The proof of Lemma 3.2 is finished.

4. Proof of Theorem 1.1

Given an f  RBMO(µ), we have to prove that T f  RBMO(µ). Put g = T f . In this section, for every doubling cube Q  Rm, we find a constant gQ  R such
that

(4.1)

1 µ(Q)

|g - gQ| dµ  C
Q

and

(4.2)

|gQ - gR|  CK(Q, R) for any two doubling cubes Q  R,

where C = Cf > 0. So, given an f  RBMO(µ) and a doubling cube Q  Rm, we apply the con-
struction described in Section 3 and we obtain

f = f1,Q + f2,Q + f3,Q = f1 + f2 + f3.

Also, we have constants b2,Q and b3,Q. By Lemma 2.6, properties (2.3) and (2.4) hold for the constants T 1 Q and T 1 R. Put
gQ = f2Q T 1 Q + b2,Q + b3,Q.

4.1. Oscillation condition (4.1). We have

1 µ(Q)

|g - gQ| dµ
Q



1 µ(Q)

|T f1 - f2Q T 1 Q | dµ + |T f2 - b2,Q| dµ + |T f3 - b3,Q| dµ

1 µ(Q)

|T f1 - f2Q T 1 Q | dµ + C f

by Lemma 3.1. Recall that T f1 = T f2Q = f2QT 1. Therefore, applying (2.3) and Lemma 2.4, we obtain

1 µ(Q)

|T f1 - f2Q
Q

T 1 Q | dµ =

|f2Q| µ(Q)

|T 1 - T 1 Q | dµ
Q

Cf .

Hence, the oscillation condition (4.1) is proved.

4.2. K-condition (4.2). Let Q  R be doubling cubes. Combining the triangle inequality and Lemma 3.2, we obtain
|gQ - gR|  |f2Q T 1 Q - f2R T 1 R | + |b3,Q - b3,R|  |f2Q T 1 Q - f2R T 1 R | + C f K(Q, R).
Next, the choice of the constants f2Q and f2R guarantees that
|f2Q - f2R|  C f A,2K(2Q, 2R)  C f K(Q, R). Also, we have T 1  L(µ) by Lemma 2.5, hence | T 1 Q |  C. Therefore,

|f2Q T 1 Q - f2R T 1 2R |  | T 1 Q ||f2Q - f2R| + |f2R| T 1 Q - T 1 R

 C f K(Q, R) + |f2R| T 1 Q - T 1 R .

Combining the above estimates, we conclude that (4.2) holds. This ends the proof of the theorem.
