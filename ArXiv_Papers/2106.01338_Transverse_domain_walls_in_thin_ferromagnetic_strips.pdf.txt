Abstract. We present a characterization of the domain wall solutions arising as minimizers of an energy functional obtained in a suitable asymptotic regime of micromagnetics for infinitely long thin film ferromagnetic strips in which the magnetization is forced to lie in the film plane. For the considered energy, we provide existence, uniqueness, monotonicity, and symmetry of the magnetization profiles in the form of 180 and 360 walls. We also demonstrate how this energy arises as a -limit of the reduced two-dimensional thin film micromagnetic energy that captures the non-local effects associated with the stray field, and characterize its respective energy minimizers.

1. Introduction
Advances in nanofabrication techniques have enabled an unprecedented degree of precision and control in producing a wide variety of solid state materials and devices in the form of atomically thin films and multilayers [62]. For ferromagnetic materials, this control offers opportunities to develop novel principles of information processing and storage based on spintronics ­ an emergent discipline of electronics in which both the electric charge and the quantum mechanical spin of an electron are harnessed [5]. In addition to the present day use of spin valves as magnetic field sensors in hard-disk drive read heads [68], some more recent applications of spintronic technology include domain wall logic and computing [2, 48, 60], magnetoresistive random access memory [3, 21, 52, 59, 69] and racetrack memory [57].
In a typical domain wall device, a bit of information is encoded using the position and polarity of a head-to-head wall along a thin, long ferromagnetic nanostrip. By "head-to-head", one understands a magnetization configuration in which the magnetization points along the strip axis, but in the opposite directions at the opposite extremes of the strip [14]. The structure of such a domain wall in soft ferromagnets rather sensitively depends on the ratio of the strip thickness and width to the characteristic length scale of the ferromagnetic material (the exchange length ex = 2A/(µ0Ms2), where A is the exchange

The material parameters are: exchange constant A = 1.4 × 10-11 J/m, saturation magnetization Ms = 1.4 × 106 A/m, and zero magnetocrystalline anisotropy or applied magnetic field [44]. For this material, the exchange length is ex = 3.37 nm.
stiffness, Ms is the saturation magnetization and µ0 is vacuum permeability [29]). Depending on the film thickness, one observes two basic types of walls ­ the transverse and the vortex wall ­ for thinner and thicker films, respectively. This picture was first established numerically by McMichael and Donahue via micromagnetic simulations [49], and later corroborated by Kl¨aui et al. through experimental studies in ferromagnetic nanorings [34, 43] (for reviews, see [33, 64]). Furthermore, as was shown numerically by Nakatani, Thiaville and Miltat [54], there exist at least two types of transverse domain walls: symmetric and asymmetric walls. Finally, winding domain walls in which the magnetization rotates by a 360-degree angle in the film plane are also known to exist in ferromagnetic nanostrips [32, 40, 67]. These types of domain wall profiles, obtained numerically using the method from [51], are illustrated in Fig. 1.

The mathematical understanding of domain wall profiles in ferromagnets rests on the micromagnetic

modeling framework, whereby the magnetization configurations representing these profiles are viewed as local or global minimizers of the micromagnetic energy functional [29, 42]. This framework has been

successfully used to characterize a great variety of domain walls and other magnetization configurations

(for an overview, see [15]; for some more recent developments, see [12, 19, 30, 31, 35, 46, 47, 53]). However,

head-to-head domain walls pose a fundamental challenge to micromagnetic modeling and analysis, since

these magnetization configurations carry a non-zero magnetic charge, which may lead to divergence of the wall energy in infinite samples due to singular behaviors of the stray field [47]. To date, there have

been only a handful of micromagnetic studies of such charged domain walls [26, 27, 36, 38, 39, 46, 47].

In [38, 39], Ku¨hn studied head-to-head domain walls in cylindrical nanowires of radius R > 0. These

walls are viewed as global minimizers of the energy

(1.1)

where m  Hl1oc(; S2),  = R := R × BR(0)  R3, and u  H°1(R3) is the magnetostatic potential solving

u =  · m

distributionally in R3, with m extended by zero to R3\. The magnetization m is subject to the condition at infinity

(1.3)

m(x, y, z)  (±1, 0, 0) as x  ±,

in some average sense (for a recent discussion of variational principles of micromagnetics, see [16]). Ku¨hn

considered existence of minimizers of E in a suitable class of magnetizations m for which (1.3) holds,

as well as a number of their characteristics depending on R. In particular, she showed that as R  0

the domain wall profile is expected to converge, in an appropriate sense, to that of a one-dimensional

transverse wall, which is given explicitly, up to translations along the x-axis and rotations in the yz-plane,

by (1.4)





m(x, y, z) = tanh(x/ 2), sech(x/ 2), 0 .

Existence and convergence of minimizers were later established by Harutyunyan for general cylindrical

domains  = R × , where   R2 is a bounded domain with a C1 boundary [27] (see also [61]). In [26],

Harutyunyan also studied the behavior of the limit energy when  is a rectangle with a large aspect ratio

and obtained an additional logarithmic factor in the scaling of the optimal energy (for sharp asymptotics,

see [22]).

In the case of  = R with R > 0 sufficiently small, the analysis mentioned above is enabled by the fact that as R  0 the magnetization becomes essentially constant in the yz-plane, allowing to asymptotically

reduce the energy to E(m)

E01d(m¯ ),

whose minimizers among all m¯  H°1(R; S2) with m¯ = m¯ (x) satisfying (1.3) are given by (1.4), up to translations and rotations in the yz-plane. The latter follows from the fact that the limit energy E01d in (1.5) is fully local, and its minimizers satisfy a simple ordinary differential equation that can be solved

explicitly. The situation becomes much more complicated for general values of R 1 or for general

cross-sections , since in that case the Euler-Lagrange equation for the minimizers of E is a system of

nonlinear partial differential equations whose explicit solution is no longer available. In particular, it is

not known whether or not the minimizers could exhibit winding, whereby the magnetization rotates by

an integer multiple of 360 along the axis of the wire, as, e.g., in Fig. 1(d).

In the absence of exact solutions and in view of the interest from applications, one can alternatively

focus on the case of asymptotically thin films, i.e., for  1 to consider the energy E(m) given by E(m)

in (1.1), in which  =  := R × (0, ) × (0, w). Here  > 0 is the film thickness and w > 0 is the

film width, respectively, both in the units of the exchange length, with the dependence of w on  as

  0 to be specified. Notice that if  were a bounded domain with the lateral extent of order w,

then from the results of Kohn and Slastikov [37] one could conclude that the full micromagnetic energy

E asymptotically reduces to E(m)

E02d(m¯ ),

where

for some  > 0 fixed, as   0. Rescaling all lengths in the film plane with w and writing m¯ = (cos , sin ), we then formally have

0 := R × (0, 1) denotes an infinite strip of unit width, and   C1(0), for example. As expected, in this scaling regime the contribution of the stray field to the energy localizes to become a nonlinear boundary penalty term, greatly simplifying the otherwise highly nonlocal problem for the domain wall profiles.
Note, however, that finding the profile in this case does not reduce to solving an ordinary differential equation for the magnetization angle, as in the case of thin ferromagnetic wires discussed earlier. Instead, the problem may be reduced to a one-dimensional fractional differential equation. To see this, let us formally reduce the minimization problem for F to the problem for the trace of  on 0 (for details, see Appendix A). It is easy to see that any minimizer of F in the form of a domain wall must be reflectionsymmetric with respect to the midline of . Hence for a given trace ¯  C(R) of  on 0 such that

(1.9)

¯(x) = k1 x < -R,

¯(x) = k2 x > R,

for some R > 0 and k1, k2  Z we can minimize the Dirichlet integral by choosing  to be the harmonic extension of ¯. A direct computation then shows that F() = 2F¯(¯), where

in which the symmetric, positive definite kernel

(1.11)

 cosh(x) K(x) := sinh2(x)

has the same singularity at the origin as the kernel generating (-d2/dx2)1/2 [18] and decays exponentially

at infinity. The Euler-Lagrange equation corresponding to F¯ reads

(1.12)

1 2¯(x) - ¯(x - ) - ¯(x + ) K()d +  sin 2¯(x) = 0 2R

x  R.

This equation is reminiscent of the fractional Ginzburg-Landau equation studied in [10, 11, 56], which is

known to exhibit transition layer profiles connecting the limits at infinity that differ by ± corresponding

to the adjacent minima of the wells of the potential appearing in the last term in (1.10). Contrary to

the problem in [10, 11, 56], however, the infimum of the energy in (1.10) is finite, making it amenable to

analysis via direct minimization. Note that when  1, minimizers of F¯ are expected to concentrate

on the O(-1) length scale (for a closely related problem, see [41]). In this case one can approximate

up to translations and additions of integer multiples of . Thus, the head-to-head domain wall profiles

minimizing E with  = R × (0, ) × (0, w) in the regime of  1 and w given by (1.7) with  1 are expected to consist of magnetizations rotating in the film plane in the form of two symmetric boundary

vortices on the opposite sides of the strip, consistently with the heuristics presented in [63]. Alternatively, when  1, one would expect the minimizers of F¯ to vary on an O(-1/2) scale, for which one can approximate x2K(x) (x), where (x) is the Dirac delta-function (cf. also [8]). In this case (1.12)

would reduce to an ordinary differential equation

(1.14)

x  R,

whose all domain wall type solutions are ¯(x) = ±2 arctan e2 x , up to translations and additions of

integer multiples of . After a suitable rescaling and a possible reflection, these correspond to the profile in (1.4).

The minimization of the energy (1.10) could in principle be carried out directly, yielding existence and

properties of minimizers for (1.8). The situation becomes more complicated, however, in the presence of an applied external field h > 0 along the strip, which amounts to an extra Zeeman term [29] added to

the energy in (1.1):

after subtracting a suitable additive constant. At the level of the limit thin film energy in (1.8), this

translates into

and clearly one could no longer explicitly minimize the first two terms in the energy for a given trace ¯,

as this would involve solving a nonlinear partial differential equation for  in 0. Instead, we will work directly with the energy in (1.16) and study its minimizers for h  0 that connect distinct equilibrium

solutions  = const as x  ±.

We first focus on (1.16) and establish existence of energy minimizers that connect distinct equilibria at x = ±, using the direct method of calculus of variations. The difficulty here is the fact that the problem is posed on an unbounded domain and, therefore, a priori minimizing sequences may fail to converge to a function that has the right behavior at infinity. We overcome this difficulty by proving monotonicity of the minimizers on larger and larger truncated domains with prescribed Dirichlet data at the left and the right ends of the truncated strip. Taking the limit of the sequence of truncated minimizers, after suitable translations, we obtain a limiting monotone function. Combining this fact with the knowledge of the behavior at infinity for functions with bounded energy (1.16) (see Lemma 3.1), we show that this limiting function is non-trivial and has the appropriate behavior at infinity. By lower semicontinuity of the energy, we subsequently conclude that the obtained limit is the desired minimizer.
Notice that the Euler-Lagrange equation form the energy in (1.16) is reminiscent of problems arising in the studies of front solutions in infinite cylinders, on which there exists an extensive literature. For example, when  = 0 and h > 0 the existence and qualitative properties of such solutions were established in [7]. A novel aspect of the considered problem is the fact that the bistable nonlinearity enabling existence of the front solutions is concentrated on the domain boundary (for several studies of problems of this kind, see e.g. [4,10,13,28]; this list is certainly not exhaustive). Our contribution here is to develop a set of tools to address the problems with boundary nonlinearities based on maximum and comparison principles and the sliding method. Using these tools, we completely classify the critical points corresponding to domain wall solutions and establish regularity, symmetry, uniqueness, monotonicity and decay properties of the domain wall profiles. In particular, we show that after reflections, translations and shifts in , all domain wall solutions associated with (1.16) are the energy minimizers that connect two distinct equilibria at infinity with no winding for h = 0 (symmetric 180 walls) or the same equilibrium at infinity with exactly one rotation for h > 0 (symmetric 360 walls). We also establish the explicit limit behaviors of the minimizers in the limiting regimes of   0 and    when h = 0.
We finally relate the minimization problem associated with (1.16) with that of the original micromagnetic problem associated with (1.15). To this end, we introduce a reduced thin film micromagnetic energy functional that is appropriate for modeling ultrathin ferromagnetic films in which the ferromagnetic layer has thicknesses down to a few atomic layers and, strictly speaking, the macroscopic energy functional in (1.15) is no longer applicable. This two-dimensional reduced thin film energy functional retains the nonlocal character of the micromagnetic energy in (1.15) in the ultrathin film regime and was introduced by us earlier in the studies of exchange biased films [46]. It represents an intermediate level of modeling between the full three-dimensional micromagnetic energy in (1.15) and the two-dimensional thin film limit energy in (1.16). Notice that the latter formally coincides with the one identified by Kohn and Slastikov in their studies of thin film limits of ferromagnets of finite lateral extent [37]. However, their analysis is no longer applicable in our setting due to the loss of compactness associated with the unbounded domain occupied by the ferromagnet. For this reason, we had to develop a series of new tools to tackle these issues in order to be able to prove the -convergence of the reduced thin film energy (to be introduced in the following section, see (2.10)) to the limit thin film energy in (1.16), together with compactness and convergence of the respective energy minimizers as the film thickness goes to zero. Importantly, we also prove that at small but finite film thickness the non-trivial energy minimizers of the reduced thin-film energy (2.10) remain close in a certain sense to the unique minimizers of the limit problem associated with (1.16). In particular, they exhibit the same head-to-head (for h = 0) or winding (for h > 0) behavior.

Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we state precisely the variational problems to be analyzed and the main results of the paper. In particular, the basic existence and qualitative properties of the domain wall profiles for the limit thin film problem are presented in Theorem 2.3, a complete characterization of all domain wall profiles of the limit problem is given in Theorem 2.6, and convergence of the minimizers in the regimes of large and small values of  for h = 0 is presented in Theorem 2.7. Finally, a characterization and the asymptotic behavior of minimizers of the reduced thin film energy as the film thickness vanishes is presented in Theorem 2.9. In Sec. 3, we present the treatment of the limit thin film energy, in which the existence result for the minimizers is given by Theorem 3.2 and the rest of the section is devoted to the proofs of Theorem 2.3, Theorem 2.6 and Theorem 2.7. We also characterize the infimum energy for the limit thin film energy in the classes of configurations with prescribed winding in Corollary 3.3. Finally, in Sec. 4 we prove a -convergence result for the reduced micromagnetic thin film energy to the limit energy analyzed in Sec. 3 in Theorem 4.9, and then establish Theorem 2.9 via a sequence of corollaries.

2. Statement of results

We now turn to the precise statements of the main results of our paper. We begin by simplifying
some of the notation. For the limit thin film energy, we drop the subscript "0" from the definition of the
two-dimensional strip domain and simply write  := R × (0, 1)  R2. By r = (x, y)   we denote a generic point in the strip, with x  R and y  (0, 1). On the strip  we introduce a local space Hl1() consisting of functions whose restrictions to truncated strips QR := (-R, R)×(0, 1) belong to H1(QR) for any R > 0. We equip Hl1() with the notion of convergence corresponding to the H1(QR) convergence of the restrictions to QR. This space plays the role of the local space Hl1oc() that allows to make sense of the traces of functions on  in the L2loc() sense.
For h  0,  > 0 and   Hl1() the thin film limit energy

(2.1)

F () :=

1 ||2 + h(1 - cos ) d2r +  sin2  dH1

2



defines a map F : Hl1()  [0, +], provided the last term in (2.1) is understood in the sense of trace. Notice that the Euler-Lagrange equation associated with (2.1) is

(2.2)

  = h sin 

in  ,

 = - sin(2) on  ,

where  denotes the derivative of  in the direction of the outward normal  to . The weak form of (2.2) is

(2.3) ( ·  + h sin() ) d2r +  sin(2)  dH1 = 0





  Hl1() with bounded support.

Remark 2.1. By Lemma 3.4 below, any bounded weak solution to (2.2), i.e., any   Hl1()L() satisfying (2.3) belongs to C() and thus is a classical solution of (2.2). Therefore, throughout the

paper we will not distinguish between weak and strong formulations of the problem.

Next, for k  Z we introduce a class of functions

(2.4) Ak :=

where (x, ·) is understood as a trace. These functions correspond to the in-plane magnetization profiles m = (cos , sin ) connecting (x, y) = 0 at x = + with (x, y) = k at x = - in an average sense. For the limit energy F , we are then interested in the following variational problem:

(2.5)

minimize F () over   Ak with k = 0 fixed.

Remark 2.2. Note that if   Ak, then -  A-k with F () = F (-). In particular, for every k  N we have

inf F () = inf F () .

Ak

A-k

In view of the previous remark, we may restrict ourselves to the case k  N in (2.5). Our first result concerns existence, uniqueness and qualitative properties of the minimizers of F in Ak.

Theorem 2.3. Let  > 0, h  0 and k  N. Then a minimizer min of F over Ak exists if and only if k = 1 for h = 0, or if and only if k = 2 for h > 0. The minimizer is unique up to translations along the x direction, belongs to C() with derivatives of all orders bounded and satisfies (2.2) classically. In addition, for all (x, y)   the minimizer min satisfies:
a) (strict monotone decrease) xmin(x, y) < 0; b) (symmetry) min(x, y) = min(x, 1 - y) and min(x, y) = k - min(a - x, y) for some a  R; b) (exponential decay at infinity) for every m  N there exist positive constants m, m such that
min - k Cm((-,-t]×[0,1])  me-mt and min Cm([t,+)×[0,1])  me-mt
for all t > 0 sufficiently large.

Our next result characterizes all domain wall type solutions for the limit thin film model, i.e., all bounded solutions of (2.2) that attain distinct pointwise limits as x  ±. More precisely, we introduce the following definition.

Definition 2.4. Let   C2()  C1()  L() be a solution of (2.2). We say that  is a domain wall solution if there exist -, +  R, - > +, such that

(2.6)

lim (x, y) = - and lim (x, y) = +

x-

x+

for all y  (0, 1) .

Remark 2.5. We make several observation regarding the above definition:
a) The condition - > + is assumed without loss of generality, as otherwise we can replace (x, y) with (-x, y) in all the statements.
b) If  is a domain wall solution in the sense of Definition 2.4 and k any integer, then  + 2k is a domain wall solution as well. If additionally h = 0, so is also  + k.
c) By Lemma 3.4, any bounded weak solution (2.3) is smooth up to the boundary with derivatives of all orders bounded, and, therefore, it solves (2.2) classically. In particular, domain wall solutions in the sense of Definition 2.4 belong to C(), and their derivatives of all orders are bounded. Moreover, by the same lemma, the convergence to ± in (2.6) holds in fact in a much stronger sense, namely uniformly with respect to the Cm-norm, for every m  N, see (3.27).

d) If h = 0, or if h > 0 and F () < +, then condition (2.6) can be replaced (see Lemma 3.5) by the following one:

(2.7)

lim (x, 0) = lim (x, 1) = - and lim (x, 0) = lim (x, 1) = + .

We also note that in view of Remark 2.5-c) the functions (x, y) = ± must themselves solve (2.2). Hence,

a priori we should have

and

±  Z when h > 0.

We now state the theorem about domain wall type solutions. In essence, our next result shows that the

only domain wall type critical points of F are the minimizers obtained in Theorem 2.3, up to a reflection

and an addition of a multiple of .

Theorem 2.6. Let  > 0 and h  0, let  be a domain wall solution in the sense of Definition 2.4, and let min be as in Theorem 2.3. Then the following uniqueness properties hold true:
a) If h = 0, then there exist k  Z and   R such that + = k, - = (k + 1), and for every (x, y)   (x, y) = min(x + , y) + k ;
b) If h > 0, then there exist k  Z and   R such that + = 2k, - = (2k + 2), and for every (x, y)   (x, y) = min(x + , y) + 2k .
Before turning to the relation between the thin limit model in (2.1) and the micromagnetic energy, we also consider the asymptotic behavior of the domain wall solutions for both  1 and  1. In view of Theorem 2.6, it is sufficient to consider the minimizers of F in the appropriate function classes. For simplicity of presentation, we will only consider the most interesting case h = 0, as the case h > 0 may be treated analogously, albeit without an explicit limiting solution when   .

Theorem 2.7. For  > 0 and h = 0, let min, be the unique minimizer of F over A1 satisfying

min, (0, ·)

=

.

Then

a) min,(x/, y)   - 2 arctan(e2x) as   0;

b)

min, (x, y) 

 2

- arctan

sinh(x) sin(y)

as   ,

locally uniformly in .

Remark 2.8. As may be seen from the proof, the result in part a) of Theorem 2.7 also holds with respect to the Hl1() convergence. However, the latter does not hold for part b), as the limit function fails to be in Hl1(). Finally, in the case h > 0 and   0 the limit solution is easily seen to be that of (2.2) with  = 0 and is, once again, one-dimensional, while as    the solution is expected to converge to a solution of
the first equation in (2.2) with Dirichlet boundary condition in the form of a piecewise-constant function
taking values 0 and 2.

Notice that the result in part b) of Theorem 2.7 provides a rigorous basis for the physical picture presented in [63]. Also, Theorem 2.7 provides a rigorous counterpart for the discussion in the introduction regarding the limiting behavior of the magnetization in the strip in the limits of large and small values of .
We finally turn to the relationship of the results obtained by us for the limit thin film energy in (2.1) with those for the micromagnetic energy. Notice that in the regime of interest the film thickness reaches an order of only a few atomic layers, making the use of the full three-dimensional micromagnetic energy

problematic. As was argued previously, a model that is more appropriate for such ultrathin films is the reduced micromagnetic thin film energy (for a detailed discussion, see [17, 46]).
Let d(r) := dist(r, R2\). For  > 0 sufficiently, small we consider the family of cutoff functions

where   C1([0, +)) is such that (0) = 0,  (t)  0 for all t  0 and (t) = 1 for t  1. Then for

m :   S1, m = (m1(x, y), m2(x, y)),

such that m  C(; R2) and m2 vanishes outside a compact set, we define the following reduced micromagnetic energy:

(2.10)

1 E(m) = 2

|m|2 d2r + 



2| ln |



div(m)(r) div(m)(r ) d2r d2r



|r - r |

+h

(1 - m1) d2r,


where  > 0 is a fixed parameter, which may be obtained from the full three-dimensional micromagnetics via a formal asymptotic reduction and a suitable rescaling of the strip width [17, 46]. The conditions on m, which we are going to relax shortly, are needed to ensure convergence of all the integrals in (2.10). In particular, it ensures that m1(x, y) = ±1 for all |x| large enough, corresponding to the head-to-head or winding domain wall configurations.
In (2.10), the parameter  represents the effective dimensionless film thickness measured relative to the strip width, and  is an effective stray field strength normalized by | ln | (compare with (1.6)). As was already mentioned, this energy is somewhat intermediate in the hierarchy of multiscale micromagnetic energies between the full three-dimensional micromagnetic energy in (1.1) (with the Zeeman term added) and the limit thin film energy in (2.1).
The assumptions about m above are clearly too restrictive for the existence of unconstrained minimizers of E. To find a more appropriate functional setting to seek the energy minimizers in the form of headto-head or winding domain walls, we pass to the Fourier space in the nonlocal term and introduce the transform F (div(m)) of div(m)  Cc(R2):

(2.11)

1

F (div(m))(k1, k2) =

e-ik1x-ik2ydiv((y)m(x, y)) dx dy,

0R

where div(m) was extended by zero outside . Clearly, under our assumption we have [45, Theorem 5.9]

(2.12)



div(m)(r) div(m)(r ) d2r d2r =



2|r - r |

R2

|F (div(m))|2 |k|

d2k (2)2 ,

which is nothing but the H°-1/2(R2) norm squared of div(m). Thus, under the above assumptions about m the energy E(m) may be alternatively written in the form

(2.13)

1 E(m) = 2

|m|2 d2r + 



2| ln |

|F (div(m))|2 d2k + h

R2

2|k|

(1 - m1) d2r.


We now wish to relax the assumptions of smoothness of m and of m2 having compact support and introduce a more natural class of magnetizations for which the energy in (2.13) remains valid, taking advantage of positivity of the nonlocal energy term written in the Fourier space. Clearly, for m  Hl1() all the local terms in the energy are well defined (possibly taking the value +). It remains to make

DOMAIN WALLS IN FERROMAGNETIC STRIPS

11

sense of the nonlocal term. For that purpose, observe that for m  Hl1() we have (with a slight abuse of notation)

(2.14)

div(m)(x, y) = (y)xm1(x, y) + (y)ym2(x, y) + (y)m2(x, y)

distributionally. Therefore, under a natural condition that m  L2(; R2) the first two terms in the right-hand side of (2.14), extended by zero outside , belong to L2(R2) and thus have a welldefined Fourier transform in the L2-sense. To make sense of the third term, we additionally assume that m2  L2(). Thus, we introduce the class

(2.15)

M := m  Hl1(; S1) : m  L2(; R2), m2  L2() ,

on

which

E

is

).

Note

that

the

assumption

m2



L2()

for all m  M forces m1(x, ·) to approach ±1 in some average sense as x  ±, thus selecting the

magnetization profiles in the form of head-to-head or winding walls.

We will show the -convergence as   0 of the energy E defined on M to the following reduced energy (see Sec. 4):

(2.16)

1 E0(m) = 2

|m|2 d2r + h


(1 - m1) d2r + 


m22 dH1.


With a slight abuse of notation, when talking about the limit   0 we will always imply taking a

sequence of k  0 as k  . Associated with the energy in (2.16), we have the following minimization problem:

(2.17) minimize E0(m) among
m = (cos , sin )  Hl1(; S1) with  satisfying (3.2) for some k1, k2  Z, k1 = k2.
Notice that for m = (cos , sin ), this energy coincides precisely with that in (2.1), and such a lifting is always possible for any m  Hl1(; S1) (see, for instance, [9]), making the energies E0(m) and F () equivalent. The -convergence result, stated in Theorem 4.9, is with respect to the strong L2loc() convergence of maps m :   S1. Using this -convergence result, we can then establish existence and a characterization of the minimizers of E in the form of domain walls in terms of those of E0 for all small enough . Note that the existence and properties of the latter are established by Theorem 2.3. Also note that by Theorem 2.3 the minimizers of E0 over Hl1(; S1) with suitable behaviors at infinity belong to M.

Theorem 2.9. Let  > 0, h  0 and k  N. Then there exists 0 > 0 such that for all   (0, 0) there exists a minimizer m = (cos , sin ) of E over all m  M with   Ak if and only if k = 1 when h = 0, or if and only if k = 2 when h > 0. As   0, every minimizer of E above converges in Hl1(; R2), after a suitable translation, to the corresponding minimizer of E0.
The above result shows that, in the considered regime of ultrathin ferromagnetic films, the domain wall-like ground states of the micromagnetic energy are head-to-head walls with no winding (180 walls) in the absence of the applied field (h = 0). When an applied field is present (h > 0), the only domain wall-like ground states are winding domain walls with a single rotation (360 walls). Furthermore, as the film thickness tends to zero these ground state profiles converge to the uniquely defined energy minimizing profiles for the limit energy E0 (up to translations). Thus, in particular our results provide a mathematical understanding for the symmetric head-to-head domain wall profiles in the absence of the applied field observed in experiments and numerical simulations of sufficiently thin nanostrips (see Fig.

12

M. MORINI, C. B. MURATOV, M. NOVAGA, AND V. V. SLASTIKOV

1(b)) and the discussion in Sec. 1. At the same time, our analysis does not capture the asymmetric head-to-head walls observed in wider nanostrips (see Fig. 1(c)). The analysis of the latter would require to consider a regime in which the stray field effect does not reduce to a purely local penalty term at the sample boundary, and is outside the regime studied in this paper. Similarly, our regime excludes the appearance of the vortex walls shown in Fig. 1(a).

3. Analysis of the thin film limit model
We start by recalling that for every m  Hl1(; S1) there exists   Hl1() such that m = (cos , sin ) (see, for instance, [9]), and the energy (2.16) may be rewritten as

(3.1)

E0(m) = F ().

In what follows, we identify any   Hl1() with the precise representative such that for every x0  R, (x0, ·) coincides a.e. with the trace of  on the vertical line x = x0.

Lemma 3.1. Let   Hl1() be such that F () < +. Then there exist k1, k2  Z such that

(3.2)

lim
x-

(x, ·) - k1

L2(0,1) = 0 and

lim
x+

(x, ·) - k2

L2(0,1) = 0 .

Furthermore, if h > 0 we have k1, k2  2Z.

Proof. Set
1
¯(x) := (x, y) dy .
0
and note that ¯  Hl1oc(R) and thus, in particular, it is continuous. We claim that

(3.3)

1 |¯ (x)|2 dx + 2 sin2 ¯(x) dx  (5 + 8)F () .

We start by observing that

2 sin2 ¯(x) dx = 2 sin2 (x, 0) dx + 2 (sin2 ¯(x) - sin2 (x, 0)) dx

Equation (3.3) then follows.

In particular, recalling (3.3), cos ¯ satisfies the Cauchy condition for x  +, that is

lim cos(¯()) - cos(¯()) = 0 ,
,+
and thus cos ¯, and in turn sin2 ¯, admit a limit as x  +. Clearly the same is true for x  -. Recalling (3.3), we conclude that

(3.5)

sin ¯(x)  0 and cos2 ¯(x)  1 as |x|  + .

DOMAIN WALLS IN FERROMAGNETIC STRIPS

We now claim that there exist k1, k2  Z such that

(3.6)

lim
x-

¯(x)

=

k1

and

lim
x+

¯(x)

=

.

Let us show only the second limit. We argue by contradiction assuming that there exist two sequences

xn < xn both diverging to + such that lim infn |¯(xn) - ¯(xn)|  . But then, by the continuity of ¯ it is clear that we may also find xn  (xn, xn) such that cos2 ¯(xn)  0, which contradicts (3.5). Thus,

(3.6) holds.

Denote

that

inequality we have

and thus, taking into account (3.6) we conclude that

and

By an application of the Trace Theorem we obtain (3.2). If h > 0, then the fact that

implies that k1, k2  2Z.

(1 - cos ) dx < +


Note that given m  Hl1(; S1), the corresponding phase function  is determined up to an additive constant of the form k, where k  Z if h = 0 or k  2Z if h > 0. In view of Lemma 3.1 we may additionally require that

(3.7)

lim
x+

(x, ·)

L2(0,1) = 0 .

Clearly by enforcing such a condition the phase function  is uniquely determined.

In the next two subsections we address the existence of minimizers and the classification of domain

wall solutions in the sense of Definition 2.4, respectively.

3.1. Existence of minimizers. We prove the following existence result.

Theorem 3.2. If h = 0 then the minimization problem (2.5) admits a solution for k = 1. If h > 0 then

the minimization problem (2.5) admits a solution for k = 2. In both cases, a solution min can be found

satisfying

1
min(0, y) dy
0

=

k .
2

Moreover,

min

 C(),

with

derivatives

and

xmin < 0 in .

Proof. We provide the proof only in the case h > 0, as the case h = 0 can be treated analogously and is simpler. To this end, for M > 0 let

A2,M :=   A2 :  = 0 in {(x, y)   : x  M } and  = 2 in {(x, y)   : x  -M } ,

and note that by standard arguments there exists a minimizer M of F over A2,M . Throughout the proof for every M > 0 we set RM := (-M, M ) × (0, 1).
We claim that

(3.8)

M (x, y)  (0, 2) for all (x, y)  RM .

This follows by first observing that by an easy truncation procedure we may conclude that M satisfies

(3.9)

0  M  2 .

14

M. MORINI, C. B. MURATOV, M. NOVAGA, AND V. V. SLASTIKOV

Moreover, by a standard first variation argument M is a weak solution to the following Euler-Lagrange problem

(3.10)



M = h sin M

in RM ,





 M = - sin(2M ) on RM   ,

M = 0   M = 2

on {M } × (0, 1) , on {-M } × (0, 1) ,

that is,

(3.11)

(M ·  + h sin(M ) ) d2r + 

sin(2M ) dH1 = 0

RM

RM 

for all   H1(RM ) s.t.  = 0 on {-M, M } × (0, 1).

Consider now the reflected function M defined on R3M by

 -M (-x - 2M, y) + 4  
M (x, y) := M (x, y)
 -M (-x + 2M, y)

if x (-3M, -M ), if x  (-M, M ) , if x (M, 3M ) .

Using the weak formulation (3.11), one can immediately check that M is in turn a weak solution; that is,

(M ·  + h sin(M ) ) d2r + 

sin(2M ) dH1 = 0

R3M

R3M 

for all   H1(R3M ) s.t.  = 0 on {-3M, 3M } × (0, 1). We may then apply the very same arguments of

Lemma 3.4-a) below (clearly, we can, since the regularity argument is local) to conclude that for every

0 < M < 3M , M  C(RM ). In particular, M  C(RM ), and (3.10) holds classically. Note that we can write

 M = c(x, y)M

in (-M, M ) × (0, 1),

M = - sin(2M ) on (-M, M ) × {0, 1},

where we set



c(x,

y)

:=

h

sin M (x,y) M (x,y)

h

if M (x, y) > 0 , if M (x, y) = 0 .

In order to prove (3.8), recall (3.9) and assume by contradiction that M = 0 at some point in (-M, M )× (0, 1). But then the Strong Maximum Principle [58, Theorem 2.2] applies and yields that M  0 in (-M, M ) × (0, 1), a contradiction to the fact that M  A2,M . If instead M = 0 at some point of the horizontal boundary (-M, M ) × {0, 1}, then thanks to the Neumann condition in (3.10) also M vanishes at the same point and thus the contradiction follows from Hopf's Lemma [23, Lemma 3.4]. Hence, we have shown that M > 0 in (-M, M ) × [0, 1]. Replacing M by 2 - M and arguing as before, we complete the proof of (3.8).
We now show that M is monotone non-increasing in the x-direction. To this aim, we adapt the classical sliding method of Berestycki and Nirenberg [6] (see also [7]) to the problem on the strip with nonlinear boundary conditions. Set

¯ := inf{ > 0 : M (· + µ, ·)  M in  for all µ  },

DOMAIN WALLS IN FERROMAGNETIC STRIPS

15

and observe that necessarily ¯  [0, 2M ). Indeed, clearly M (· + µ, ·)  M for all µ  2M . Moreover,
since M (· + 2M, ·) = 0 < 2 = M on {-M } × [0, 1], by continuity we may find  > 0 so small
that M (· + 2M - s, ·) < M on [-M, -M + s] × [0, 1] for all s  (0, ], which in turn easily implies M (· + 2M - s, ·)  M for the same s. Thus ¯  2M - .
Note that ¯ = 0 if and only if M is monotone non-increasing in the x-direction. Assume by contradiction that ¯ > 0. This means that M (· + ¯, ·)  M and we claim that there exists (x¯, y¯)  [-M, M -¯]×[0, 1] such that M (x¯+¯, y¯) = M (x¯, y¯). Indeed, if not then we would have M (·+¯, ·) < M in [-M, M - ¯] × [0, 1] and in turn, arguing as above, M (· + ¯ - , ·)  M in [-M, M - ¯ + ] × [0, 1] for all  small enough, contradicting the minimality of ¯. We claim now that x¯  (-M , M - ¯). Indeed, if x¯ = -M , then M (x¯ + ¯, y¯) = M (x¯, y¯) = 2 which is impossible thanks to (3.8) since x¯ + ¯  (-M, M ). If instead x¯ = M - ¯, then M (x¯, y¯) = M (M, y¯) = 0, which is again impossible by (3.8) since x¯ < M .
We now set u := M - M (· + ¯, ·). Note that u satisfies

(3.12)



u = c~u





 

u

=

-(sin(2M

)

-

sin(2M

(·

u  0 ,   u(x¯, y¯) = 0 ,

in (-M, M - ¯) × (0, 1) , on (-M, M - ¯) × {0, 1} ,

where

:=

 h

sin(M )-sin(M (·+¯,·)) M -M (·+¯,·)

h

in {M > M (· + ¯, ·)} , in {M = M (· + ¯, ·)} .

Now if y¯  (0, 1), then we can invoke again the Strong Maximum Principle [58, Theorem 2.2] to conclude that u  0 in [-M, M - ¯] × [0, 1], and in particular that M (M - ¯, y) = M (M, y) = 0, which is a

contradiction to (3.8). If instead y¯  {0, 1}, then by Hopf's Lemma [23, Lemma 3.4] we have u(x¯, y¯) = 0, which contradicts the boundary condition in (3.12). This concludes the proof of the fact that ¯ = 0 and

thus that M is monotone non-increasing in the x-direction.

We now set ¯M (x) :=

1 0

M

(x,

dy.

Note

that

¯M

and

that

¯M (x)

=

0

for

x



M

and ¯M (x) = 2 for x  -M . Thus, we may find xM such that ¯M (xM ) = . We set ~M := M (·+xM , ·).

Observing that F (M ) is non-increasing in M , we easily see that {~M }M1 is equibounded in Hl1().

Thus, we may find a sequence Mn  + and a function   Hl1() such that ~Mn  weakly in

Hl1(), and

M. MORINI, C. B. MURATOV, M. NOVAGA, AND V. V. SLASTIKOV

We claim that   A2. To this aim, in view of (3.13) and Lemma 3.1, and recalling that 0    2, we have

lim

(x, ·) - k1

L2 (0,1)

= 0 and

lim

(x, ·) - k2

L2(0,1) = 0 ,

with k1, k2  {0, 2}. Now, by monotonicity and (3.14) we infer that necessarily k1 = 2 and k2 = 0. This shows that   A2.
In order to conclude that  is a minimizer, in view of (3.13) it remains to show that

(3.16)

To this aim, it is clearly enough to show that

(3.17) for   A2 with F () < + and  > 0 there exists M > 0 and ~  A2,M such that F (~)  F () + .

In order to show this, we select two sequences, x+n  + and x-n  -, such that

(3.18)

(x+n , ·)  0 and (x-n , ·)  2 uniformly in [0, 1] ,

and

(3.19)

lim sup (x±n , ·) H1(0,1) < + .

This is possible by a simple slicing argument thanks to the fact that ||  L2(). At this point, for

every n  N we define

1-

x- n -x 2-(x- n ,·)

if x  (x-n , x+n ) , if x  x+n , if x  x-n ,

with the understanding that n  0 for x  xn if (x+n , ·)  = 0, and n  2 for x  xn if 2 - (x-n , ·)  = 0. Clearly each n belongs to A2,Mn for some Mn > 0 sufficiently large. Moreover, using (3.18) and (3.19), it is easy to check that F (n) - F ()  0 as n  , thus establishing (3.17) and
finishing the proof of existence.

We are left with showing that x < 0 in . We already know that  is a smooth function, with x  0 everywhere. Differentiating (3.15) with respect to x we obtain

(3.20)

 (x) = h cos x

in  ,

 (x) = -2 cos(2)x on  .

Assume x(x¯, y¯) = 0 at some point (x¯, y¯)  . If (x¯, y¯)  , then using the Strong Maximum Principle [58, Theorem 2.2] we obtain a contradiction. If instead (x¯, y¯)  , then also (x) vanishes at the same point and thus the contradiction follows from Hopf's Lemma [23, Lemma 3.4].

Corollary 3.3. If h > 0 then for every k  2N we have

If h = 0 then for every k  N we have

Proof. We provide the proof only for the case h > 0, the other one being analogous. As in the previous proof, we fix M > 0 and let

Ak,M := {  Ak : (x, y) = 0 if x  M and (x, y) = k if x  -M }. It is clear that there exists a minimizer

(3.21)

M = argminAk,M F () .

By the same arguments and with the same notation used in the proof of Theorem 3.2 we obtain

i) M  (0, k) in RM ; ii) M  C(RM ); iii) M has negative derivative in x-direction everywhere in (-M, M ) × [0, 1].

Arguing as in the proof of Theorem 3.2, we can show that

(3.22)

where Mj  Ak,Mj is a minimizer of the corresponding problem (3.21) and {Mj} is any sequence of positive numbers such that Mj  .

Now observe that by the properties stated above, for every j  N we may find smooth functions gij  C([0, 1]), i = 1, . . . , k/2 - 1, such that

Mj > g1j > g2j > · · · > gkj/2-1 > -Mj

and

Mj (gij(y), y) = 2i for all y  [0, 1] .

Setting also g0j := Mj, gkj/2 := -Mj and ji := {(x, y) : gij-1(y) > x > gij(y)}, we clearly have

Note that ij - 2(i - 1)  A2 and F (ij - 2(i - 1)) = F (ij), and thus F (ij)  minA2 F (). In turn, by combining (3.22) and (3.23), we deduce that

In order to obtain the reverse inequality, we start from the minimizer 2,Mj of the problem (3.21), with k = 2 and M = Mj, and define the function j  Ak as

3.2. Uniqueness of minimizers and classification of critical points. Next we address uniqueness of minimizers for the problem (2.5). In fact, we will classify all the critical points subject to constant boundary conditions at infinity; i.e., domain wall solutions to the boundary reaction-diffusion type problem of the form in (2.2) satisfying (2.6).
We start by showing that such critical points are smooth up to the boundary, with uniform estimates at infinity. To this aim, given t  R we denote

(3.24)

±t := {(x, y)   : x  t} ,

and we recall that given an open set   R2 with Lipschitz boundary the trace space H1/2() of H1()

may be equipped with the norm

Moreover, with a slight abuse of notation, for any subset    (and for w  H1/2()) we will denote

:=

[w]2H°1/2(),

where

Lemma 3.4. Let   Hl1()  L() be a solution of (2.3). Then, up to choosing a representative, the following statements hold true:

a)   C(), and for every k  N there exists a constant Ck = Ck(, h,  ) > 0 such that

(3.26)

 Ck()  Ck ;

b) if in addition  satisfies (2.6), then the convergence at infinity is uniform with respect to the Ck-norm for any k  N, i.e.,

Proof. In what follows, for all t  R and R > 0 we set QtR := (t - R, t + R) × (0, 1); moreover, C will denote a positive constant depending only on R that may change from line to line.
We first observe that by a standard Caccioppoli Inequality type argument, that is, testing (2.3) with  = 2, where   C is with compact support in , we may infer from the boundedness of  that  is uniformly locally bounded with respect to the L2-norm. More precisely, for every R > 0 there
exists C1 = C1(, h,  , R) > 0 such that suptR  H1(QtR)  C1. In turn, by the Trace Theorem, see for instance [55, Theorem 5.5], we have   H1/2(QtR)   C H1/2(QtR)  H1(QtR)  CC1 and, in turn, using the definition (3.25) of the Gagliardo seminorm we may check that sin(2)  H1/2(QtR) C  H1/2(QtR)  CC1. Thus,

(3.28)

 sin(2) H1/2(QtR)  CC1 .

Fix t  R and a cut-off function   Cc(-3R, 3R), 0    1, and   1 in [-2R, 2R]. Let 0  R2 be a bounded domain with boundary of class C such that Q03R  0 , and let t := {(x, y) : (x-t, y)  0}. Finally, denote by g the function defined for H1-a.e. (x, y)  t by



- (x - t) sin(2(x, y)) if (x, y)  t   ,

g(x, y) :=

0

otherwise.

Using again (3.25), one can check that g  H1/2(t), with

(3.29)

g H1/2(t)  C sin(2) , H1/2(Qt2R)

where C > 0 depends only on  and 0 and thus, ultimately, only on R. In turn, by [25, Theorem 1.5.1.2]

there exists a lifting function g~  H2(t) such that g~ = g on t and

(3.30)

g~ H2(t)  C g H1/2(t)  C sin(2) , H1/2(Qt2R)

where we used (3.29) (and, again, the constants C, C depend only on R). Since g~ = g = - sin(2) on Qt2R  , integration by parts yields

(g~ ·  + g~ ) d2r +  sin(2) dH1 = 0





  Hl1() with supp   Qt2R.

Subtracting the above identity from (2.3) and setting w :=  - g~, we get

w ·  + (h sin  - g~)  d2r = 0

that is w is a weak solution to  w = h sin  - g~
 w = 0

  Hl1() with supp   Qt2R ,
in Qt2R , on Qt2R   .

Thus, by standard H2-estimates (see for instance [23]) and taking into account (3.28) and (3.30), we get

(3.31)   H2(QtR) w + H2(QtR) g~ H2(Qt2R)  C h sin  - g~ + L2(Qt2R) w H1(Qt2R) + CC1  C2
for a suitable positive constant C2 depending only on R,  , , and h. We can now start a bootstrap argument in order to obtain uniform estimates also with respect to
higher norms. Owing to (3.31) and to the fact that sin(2) H2(QtR)  M , with M = M  H2(QtR) (and thus ultimately depending only R,  , , and h), by applying the Trace Theorem again we can improve (3.28) to obtain for all t  R

sup
tR

sin(2) H3/2(QtR)  CM .

Now, arguing as above and relying again on [25, Theorem 1.5.1.2] we may find a "lifting" function

g~  H3(t) such that  g~ = - sin(2) on Qt2R   and

g~ H3(t)  C sin(2) . H3/2(Qt2R) Thus, defining w as before and arguing similarly, we clearly may improve estimate (3.31) to obtain for every R > 0

sup
tR



H3(QtR)  C3

for a suitable positive constant C3 depending only on R,  , , and h. We can now iterate this

argument to show that for every k  N there exists a positive constant Ck depending only on R,  ,

, and h such that

(3.32)

sup
tR



Hk(QtR)  Ck

for all R > 0. In turn, (3.32) combined with the Sobolev Embedding Theorem yields (3.26).

The uniform bounds (3.26), together with the convergence condition in Definition 2.4 give (3.27). The

latter in particular implies that both  and  vanish at infinity. Thus, from (2.2) we deduce that sin(2 ±) = 0 and that also sin( ±) = 0 when h > 0. The last part of statement b) readily follows.

In the next lemma we show that in the case h = 0, or h > 0 and F () < +, condition (2.7) is equivalent to (2.6).
Lemma 3.5. Let   C2()  C1()  L() be a solution of (2.2) such that (2.7) holds. Assume that either h = 0, or h > 0 and F () < +. Then also (2.6) holds true.

Proof. Consider first the case h = 0. Let {n} be a sequence such that n  + and set n := (·+n, ·). By statement a) of Lemma 3.4 we have that for every k  N the sequence {n} is uniformly bounded with respect to the Ck-norm on . Therefore, we may find a subsequence {nk } and a bounded function  solving (2.2) such that nk   in Ck on the compact subsets of  for every k  N. Moreover, in view of (2.7) we also have  = + on . In particular,  is a bounded harmonic function in , which is constant on . It easily follows that   +. One way to see this is to extend the harmonic function  - + to the whole plane by repeated odd reflections across the lines {x = j}, j  Z, thus getting an entire bounded harmonic function w, vanishing on such lines. Liouville's Theorem implies that w  0 in R2 and thus, in particular,   + in . In turn, this implies that (nk , y)  (0, y) = + as k   for all y  [0, 1]. By the arbitrariness of {n} we have shown that the second condition in (2.6) is satisfied. A similar argument shows that also the first one holds true.
Assume now that h > 0 and F () < + and note that the latter condition immediately implies that both -, +  Z. We may now run a similar argument as in the h = 0 case. Let {n}, {n} be as before and let  be the limit (up to a subsequence) of n. One can show that in this case  solves

  = h sin   
  = 0
  = +

in  , on  , on  .

Even reflections with respect to  allow one to extend  to a function ~ defined on the "tripled" stripe ~ := R × (-1, 2) still solving the same equation

~ = h sin ~ in ~ .

By classical results, see for instance [50, Theorem 6.8.2], we infer that ~ is analytic in ~ and thus, in particular,  is analytic in  up to the boundary. But then, owing to the overdetermined boundary conditions on , by the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya Theorem (see for instance [20]) it follows that   + in a neighborhood of  and thus, by analyticity, everywhere in . This establishes the second condition in (2.6) and the first one can be proven similarly.

We now start paving the way for the application of the sliding method to our situation. We recall that owing to Lemma 3.4, bounded weak solutions to (2.2) are in fact smooth classical solutions and thus, in what follows, we will not distinguish between weak and strong formulations. We begin with the following comparison principle for problem (2.2), where we will be using notation (3.24).

Lemma 3.6. Let t  R and let 1, 2 be domain wall solutions to (2.2) according to Definition 2.4, with

1  2 on t := {x = t}  .

Denote by

and   sin(2) is strictly increasing in J, together with   sin() if h > 0. Then, 1  2 in +t . The

same statement holds true with

+ i

and

+t

replaced

by

- i

and

-t ,

respectively.

Proof. We prove the statement only for +t , the other case being analogous. For any fixed  > 0 set

 := (1 - 2 - )++ t and note that from the assumptions 1  2 on t and

+ 1



+2 , taking into

account part b) of Lemma 3.4, we conclude that the function  is in H1() with bounded support

contained in +t . Testing (2.3) for i with  and subtracting the two resulting equations we get

(sin(1) - sin(2)) d2r

+ t

{1 -2 >}+ t

(sin(21) - sin(22)) dH1 = 0 .

{1-2>}(+ t \t)

Note that 1(·), 2(·)  J in {1 -2 > }+t , thanks to (3.33). Using now the monotonicity assumptions

on sin(2) and sin() for   J, we may conclude from the above integral identity that   0 and that 1 - 2  , or equivalently  = 0 on +t . Thus,   0, that is, 1 - 2   in +t . The conclusion

follows from the arbitrariness of .

In the lemma below, we write down a version of the Strong Maximum Principle which works for (2.2). Note that a similar principle (and the argument behind) has been used already in the proof of Theorem 3.2.

Lemma 3.7. Let U  R2 be a connected open set and let 1, 2  C2()  C1() be solutions of (2.2) such that 1  2 in U  . Assume that 1(x¯, y¯) = 2(x¯, y¯) for some point (x¯, y¯)  U  . Then 1 = 2 in U  .

Proof. We can argue similarly as in the proof of Theorem 3.2. Indeed, setting u := 2 - 1, we note that u is smooth up to U   and satisfies

(3.34)



u = c~u

in U   ,







u = -(sin(22) - sin(21)) on U   ,

u  0    u(x¯, y¯) = 0 ,

in U   ,

where now



c~

:=

h

sin(2 )-sin(1 2 -1

)

h

in U  {2 > 1} , in U  {2 = 1} .

Notice that if y¯  {0, 1}, then by Hopf's Lemma [23, Lemma 3.4] we have u(x¯, y¯) = 0, which contradicts the Neumann boundary condition in (3.34). Thus, necessarily y¯  (0, 1). We may then invoque the Strong

Maximum Principle [58, Theorem 2.2] to conclude that u  0 and in turn 2 = 1 in U  .

We continue now with some elementary considerations, showing in particular that only some specific values are admissible for 1 and 2.
As a consequence of the Strong Maximum Principle and of the comparison Lemma 3.6 we have the following observation, which will be instrumental in the implementation of the sliding method.

Lemma 3.8. Let 1, 2 be domain wall solutions to (2.2) according to Definition 2.4, and denote by

- i

,

+i , i = 1, 2, the boundary conditions at infinity of i according to (2.6). Assume that 1  2 in  and

that

.

Assume also that there exist two open intervals J+, J- where   sin(2) is strictly

increasing and so is   sin() if h > 0, and such that

± 2

Then,

there exists   R such that

1(· + , ·)  2.

Proof. Let us first show that it is impossible to have

+ 2

>

+ 1

or

- 2

>

- 1

.

To this aim we argue by

contradiction.

Assume first that

± 2

>

± 1

.

Since also

- 1

>

+2 , there exists   R such that 1(· + , ·)  2 and

1(x¯ + , y¯) = 2(x¯ + , y¯) for some point (x¯, y¯)  . Thus by Lemma 3.7 the two solutions coincide

which contradicts our initial assumption

± 2

±1 .

Assume now that

but

may choose t+ such that

Set now

0 := inf{  0 : 1(· + , ·)  2} .

Note that thanks to the assumption

we have 0

Moreover, clearly 1(· + 0, ·)  2

and

thus, in particular, recalling (3.35), we have

(3.36)

sup 1(· + 0, ·) < sup J +.
+ t+

We claim that 1(· + 0, ·) and 2 coincide at some point in . Indeed if by contradiction 1(· + 0, ·) < 2

everywhere, then, using also that

- 2

-1 , we have min- t+ (2 - 1(· + 0, ·)) > 0. By uniform continuity,

recalling (3.36), we may find  > 0 so small that

(3.37)

min(2 - 1(· + 0 - , ·)) > 0 and sup 1(· + 0 - , ·) < sup J + .

- t+

+ t+

Recalling also (3.35), we are in a position to apply Lemma 3.6 to infer that 1(· + 0 - , ·)  2 in

+t+ and in turn, thanks to the first condition in (3.37), 1(· + 0 - , ·)  2 in . This contradicts the

minimality of 0. Therefore, 1(· + 0, ·) and 2 must coincide at some point in  and thus everywhere

thanks to the Strong Maximum Principle. This again leads to a contradiction. The case where

+ 2

but

is

clearly

analogous.

It remains to consider the case

Then, recalling (3.36) and noticing also that sup- t- 1(· + 0, ·)  sup- t- 2 < sup J - by (3.38), we may find  > 0 so small that

Taking into account also (3.35) and (3.36), we may apply Lemma 3.6 to infer that 1(· + 0 - , ·)  2 in ±t± and in turn, thanks to the first condition in (3.37), 1(· + 0 - , ·)  2 in . This contradicts the minimality of 0 and the conclusion follows.
We are now ready to prove the main result of this section, showing that domain wall solutions in the sense of Definition 2.4 are unique up to horizontal translations and addition of integer multiples of , and coincide with the global minimizer constructed in Theorem 3.2, which is in turn unique.

Proof of Theorem 2.6. We only consider the case h = 0, the other one being analogous. We recall that by

Lemma 3.4

-,

+



 2

Z,

hence

there

are

three

possible

cases:

- - + > ,

- - + = , and

--

+=

.

We start by showing that the first case cannot occur. Indeed, assume by contradiction that - - + > 

and recall that ~ := + is also a domain wall solution thanks to Remark 2.5-b). Moreover, - > + + =

~+. Then, arguing as at the beginning of the proof of Lemma 3.8 we may find   0 such that (· + , ·)

and  +  coincide at some point in  and thus everywhere by the Strong Maximum Principle Lemma 3.7.

This is clearly impossible.

Let us now assume

--

+  . First of all note that since

upon

replacing



by

for

a

suitable k  Z, we may assume thanks to Remark 2.5-b) that either

+ = 0 or

.

Let

us

consider

first the case

+ = 0 and thus

-



{

}.

Note

that

by

the

Strong

Maximum

Principle

(Lemma

3.7)

we

may easily infer that  < (· + , ·) +  for all   R. Indeed if not, it would be possible to find 0  R

such that   (· + , ·) + , with the two functions coinciding at some point and therefore everywhere

by Lemma 3.7, which is clearly impossible. In turn,

(3.40)

  lim (· + , ·) +  = + +  =  ,
+

and in fact the inequality is strict thanks to Lemma 3.7 and the fact that the constant function  is also

a solution to (2.2).

Now recall that min, the minimizer from Theorem 3.2, vanishes at x = +  and converges to  at x = - . In particular, thanks to Lemma 3.4 we have

(3.41)

lim
t-

min - 

L(- t ) = 0

and

lim

min

L(+ t ) = 0 ;

moreover, 0 < min <  in . Thus, we may find t- < t+ such that

(3.42)

and

 0 < min < 4

in +t+ .

Clearly, we also have that

Since by Lemma 3.4 we also have

we may now find  > 0 so large that

L(+ t ) = 0 ,

where m is the constant in (3.43). We claim that

Indeed, (3.43) and (3.44) imply that the inequality holds in +t-  -t+ . It remains to show that the inequality (· + , ·)  min holds also in ±t± . Let us start with +t+ . Recall that (· + , ·) < min on

Note also that (3.44)) implies 3.6 with 1 = (· + , ·), 2 =

that

by (3.40) and (3.42), respectively. Moreover, (· + , ·) < min on {(x, y) : x = t-}   thanks to (3.43)

and (3.44).

Thus we may apply

again Lemma 3.6

with 1,

2

as before and J

=

(

3 4

,

5 4

)

to

conclude

that the inequality holds also in -t- and thus (3.45) is proven.

We are now in a position to apply Lemma 3.8 to deduce that there exists ¯  R such that (· + ¯, ·) =

min in .

Finally, the case

+

can

be

dealt

with

similarly

by

finding

such

that

(3.45)

holds

and

then by applying Lemma 3.8 to conclude. The argument to show the existence of a such a  is similar as

before, and in fact easier as we may take advantage of the fact that both limits at x = ±  of (x, ·) are

strictly smaller than the corresponding limits of min. The details are left to the reader.

We now collect several corollaries. The first one is an immediate consequence of Theorems 3.2 and 2.6.

Corollary 3.9. The minimum problem (2.5) with k  N (see also Remark 2.2) admits a solution if and only if k = 1 in the case h = 0, and if and only if k = 2 in the case h > 0. Moreover, the solution is unique and coincides, up to a translation in the x-direction, with the function min provided by Theorem 3.2.
Setting min(x, y) := min(-x, y), the previous corollary yields immediately the following result.
Corollary 3.10. Any minimizer m of (2.17) coincides, up to a translation in the x-direction, with either (cos min, sin min), or (cos min, - sin min), or (cos min, sin min), or (cos min, - sin min).

The next corollary deals with symmetry and decay properties of the domain wall profile min.

Corollary 3.11. In addition to the properties stated in Theorem 3.2, the profile min minimizing (2.5) with k = 1 for h = 0, or k = 2 for h > 0 satisfies:

a) (symmetry) min(x, y) = min(x, 1 - y) and min(x, y) = k - min(-x, y) for all (x, y)  ; b) (exponential decay at infinity) for every m  N there exist positive constants m, m such that

min - k Cm(- -t)  me-mt and for all t > 0 sufficiently large.

min Cm(+ t )  me-mt

Proof. Observing that min(·, 1 - ·) is still a domain wall solution satisfying the normalization condition

1 0

min

(0,

y)

dy

=

k 2

,

the

first

symmetry

property

follows

at

once

from

the

uniqueness

result

of

Theo-

rem 2.6. The second symmetry property is proven in a similar way, observing that k - min(-·, ·) is also

a domain wall solution satisfying the same normalization condition. This concludes the proof of part a)

of the corollary.

In order to prove the second part, we employ a barrier argument. Clearly, by the symmetry property

established in part a) it is enough to show the exponential decay as x  +. To this aim, we fix 0 > 0

so small that

(3.46) and choose t¯ > 0 so large that (3.47)

sin(2)   for all   (0, 0) , 0 < min < 0 in +t¯ .

DOMAIN WALLS IN FERROMAGNETIC STRIPS

Recall that this is possible due to the fact that min L(+ t )  0 as t  +. We now define the barrier + in +t¯ as
+(x, y) := 0(y)e-(x-t¯) ,

where

1 (y) := 1 + y(1 - y),

and  = () > 0 is a constant sufficiently small so that

Moreover, by the uniform convergence to 0 of min(x, ·) - + as x  +, we have that  has bounded support in +t¯ .
Plugging  into (2.3), with  = min, and also into (3.49), and subtracting the two resulting inequalities,
we get

thanks to (3.46) and (3.47). Thus for the above integral inequality to hold it is necessary that   0 in

Proof of Theorem 2.3. Finally, combining the results of Corollary 3.9 and Corollary 3.11 yields the conclusion of Theorem 2.3.

For ¯  Hl1oc(R), we can also define G(¯) as

Notice that if ~(x, y) = ¯(x), then F~(~) = G(¯). Therefore, if min, is a minimizer of the energy F ()

then

it

is

clear

that

F~ (~min, )

This

implies that |~min,| is bounded in L2(), and y~min,  0 in L2() as   0. It follows that there

is a subsequence (not relabelled) such that ~min,  weakly in Hl1() and ~min,   in L2loc()

(see, e.g., [1]) with (x, y) = ¯(x) for some ¯  Hl1oc(R).

We observe that ¯ is a minimizer of the energy G in the class

Indeed, for any ¯  A11d and (x, y) = ¯(x) we have   A1 and

Therefore

¯(x) =  - 2 arctan(e2x)

is the unique minimizer of G in A11d and we deduce that ~min,   in Hl1() for the whole sequence. Finally, we note that by the strong convergence of ~min, to  in L2loc(), monotonicity of ~min,(·, 0),
and continuity and decay at infinity of  we also have that ~min,   uniformly in . Therefore,

since min, is harmonic in , with the help of the representation



~min, (x, y) =

P (x - x , y) ~min, (x , 0) dx

-

from (A.6), where P(x, y) := -1/2P (-1/2x, y) and P (x, y) is the Poisson kernel given in (A.7), the assertion easily follows by observing that P(·, y) L1(R) = 1 and P(·, y) approaches a Dirac deltafunction for every y  (0, 1) as   0, together with uniform bounds on the derivatives of

4. The reduced two-dimensional micromagnetic model
We now turn to the analysis of the relationship between the minimizers of the reduced micromagnetic model introduced in (2.10) and those of the thin film limit model in (2.16). In what follows it is understood that both E and E0 are defined for any function in L2loc(; S1) simply by setting them equal to + outside M and Hl1(; S1), respectively. Note that {m  L2loc(; S1) : E(m) < +} is a strict subset of Hl1(; S1), and the same is true for E0.
In what follows, we assume that, if not otherwise specified, C is a positive constant that might depend only on , h and  . We also denote by F (f ) the Fourier transform of f  L2(R2), defined as

(4.1)

F (f )(k) := e-ik·rf (r) d2r,
R2

for f  L1(R2)  L2(R2).

We start with several simple lemmas which will be useful in handling an unbounded domain . We

provide proofs for the reader's convenience. Recall that [w]H°1/2(R) refers to the Gagliardo seminorm of w defined in (3.25).

Lemma 4.1. There exists C > 0 such that for all w  H1() and all y  [0, 1] there holds:

(4.2) (4.3)

[w(·, y)]2H°1/2(R) +

w(·, y)

),

w

2 L2 ()



C(

w

2 L2 ()

+

w(·, y)

2 L2

(R)

),

where w(·, y) is understood in the sense of trace.

Proof. By a reflection with respect to the lines y = 0 and y = 1 followed by a multiplication by a smooth cutoff function (y) that vanishes outside [-2, 2], we may extend w to a function w~  H1(R2) such that
w = w~ in  and w~ H1(R2)  C w H1() for some universal C > 0. Therefore, by a density argument we may assume that w  Cc(R2) throughout the rest of the proof.
To prove (4.2), without loss of generality we may assume that y = 0. Letting w^ := F (w) and using
the Fourier inversion formula, we get

1 w(x, 0) = (2)2

R2

eik1xw^(k1, k2) dk1 dk2

=

1 (2)2

eik1x
R

w^(k1, k2) dk2 dk1.
R

Therefore, the one-dimensional Fourier transform v^(k) of v(x) := w(x, 0) equals

v^(k) := e-ikxw(x, 0) dx = 1 w^(k, s) ds.

R

2 R

Using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we thus obtain

|v^(k)|2

w^(k, s) ds
R

 (2)2

ds R 1 + k2 + s2

|w^(k, s)|2(1 + k2 + s2) ds.

In turn, using the fact that

ds 1+k2 +s2

=

 1+k2

we

deduce that

(1 + |k|) |v^(k)|2  2 1 + k2 |v^(k)|2  1 |w^(k, s)|2(1 + k2 + s2) ds. 2 R
Finally, integrating the above inequality in k and using the Fourier representations of the H1(R2) and H1/2(R) norms [45] we obtain the desired inequality.

DOMAIN WALLS IN FERROMAGNETIC STRIPS

We now turn to (4.3). By Young's and Jensen's inequalities, for every x  R and y  [0, 1] we have

y

1

|w(x, y )|2 = w(x, y) + sw(x, s) ds  2|w(x, y)|2 + 2 |sw(x, s)|2 ds.

y

0

Therefore, integrating over x and y yields (4.3).

Lemma 4.2. For any a, b > 0 we have



 e-a x2+b2

 x2 + b2

dx = K0(ab) ,

where K0(z) is the modified Bessel function of the second kind of order zero.

Proof. The identity follows from the integral representation [24, 8.432-1] of K0(z) by the change of variable x = b sinh t.

Lemma 4.3. For any a > 0 we have

e-a|r|

F

(k) =

2|r|

a2 + |k|2

Proof. Denoting by J0(z) the Bessel function of the first kind of order zero, recall that for every t  R

where the last equality follows from [24, 6.611-1].

We now proceed towards the proof of Theorem 2.9. We first establish the following result.

Proposition 4.4. There exists 0 > 0 and C > 0 depending only on   such that for all   (0, 0) and m  M, the following inequality holds:

(4.4)

C (

for all   (0, 1).

Proof. We first note that extending m by zero outside  we have m  Hl1oc(R2; R2). Furthermore, due to our assumptions on m we get div (m) = div m + m2  L2(R2) and, therefore, its Fourier transform makes sense in L2(R2) [45]. We next fix 0 < a  1 to obtain

The above trick allows us to control the behavior of the expression under the integral at infinity and

significantly simplifies the subsequent analysis of the magnetostatic energy, essentially reducing it to the

analysis on compact domains.

We now define

(4.7)

e-a|r-r | Ka(r - r ) := |r - r |

and proceed to write the integral in the right-hand side of (4.6) as

(4.8) where

div(m)(r) div(m)(r )Ka(r - r ) d2r d2r = I1 + 2I2 + I3,
R2 R2

I1 :=

(r)div(m)(r) (r )div(m)(r )Ka(r - r ) d2r d2r ,

R2 R2

(4.9)

I2 :=

(r)div(m)(r) ( · m)(r )Ka(r - r ) d2r d2r ,

R2 R2

I3 :=

( · m)(r) ( · m)(r )Ka(r - r ) d2r d2r .

R2 R2

Using the Fourier representation and Young's inequality, one can see that

1

-  I1 - I3  2I2   I1 + I3,

for any  > 0. Therefore, we have

(4.10)

(1 - -1)I1 + (1 - )I3 

div(m)(r) div(m)(r )Ka(r - r ) d2r d2r  (1 + -1)I1 + (1 + )I3 .

In order to estimate I3 we write

where (4.13)

1 J2 := 2
1 J3 := 2

R×[0,] R×[1-,1]
 (y/)m2(r)  (y /)m2(r )Ka(r - r ) d2r d2r .
R×[1-,1] R×[1-,1]

We would like to show that J2 is negligible compared to J1 and J3. Using Young's inequality for convolutions, it is straightforward to see that for  sufficiently small

It is clear that the integrals J1 and J3 are similar. Therefore, we provide an estimate for J1 only. We

The second conclusion now follows again by (4.3).

We now prove the lim inf and lim sup inequalities for the magnetostatic energy term.

Finally, taking the limit as   0 we obtain (4.22). We are left with showing the second part of the statement. We note that by our assumptions on m
there exists R > 1 such that

(4.24)

{m = 0}  QR,

where QR := (-R, R) × (0, 1)  . Moreover, since by assumption m2  L2(), we have

(4.25)

m2 = 0 a.e. in  \ QR .

We start by splitting the magnetostatic energy as in (4.8), with Ka replaced by the original kernel

With

it is straightforward to see that the second inequality in (4.10) still holds.

Taking into account (4.25), we can split J1 as

provided that  is sufficiently small. Note that the second inequality can be easily obtained by computing

explicitly the innermost integral and by estimating the result (for  sufficiently small) with | ln(|y - y |)| + C~ for a suitable C~ > 0, while the third inequality can be obtained by integrating out | ln |y - y ||.

Combining (4.26) and (4.27)­(4.32) and the completely analogous estimates for J3, we obtain (4.23).

As a straightforward consequence of (4.4) in Proposition 4.4 we have the following corollary.

Corollary 4.7. For any M > 0, let 0 > 0 be as in Proposition 4.4. Then, for all   (0, 0) and m  M such that E(m)  M we have
E0(m)  CM,
for a suitable C > 0 independent of , M and m.

Before analysing the asymptotic behavior of E as   0, let us show that for  > 0 small enough E admits a global minimizer in the class of magnetizations with nontrivial "winding".

Proposition 4.8. There exists 1 > 0 such that for all   (0, 1) the following problem: (4.33) min {E(m) : m = (cos , sin )  M with  satisfying (3.2) for some k1, k2  Z, k1 = k2} 1 admits a solution.
1Note that here we are not fixing k1 and k2, but we are also minimizing with respect to k1 and k2, with k1 = k2.

Proof. Denote by i the infimum of the problem in (4.33) and observe that

M := 1+ sup i < + .

(0,

1 2

)

Indeed, it is enough to consider a fixed test function m = (cos , sin )  M such that the set {r   : m2(r) = 0} is bounded and  satisfies the proper boundary conditions at infinity. By Proposition 4.6 we easily get

i  E(m)  C .

Let 1 := 0(M ), where 0(M ) is as in in Proposition 4.4, and let   (0, 1). If mn = (cos n, sin n) is a minimizing sequence for (4.33), by Corollary 4.7 we have

F (n)  C

for every n large enough, with C independent of n. Set

(4.34)

1
¯n(x) := (x, y) dy .
0

By shifting and flipping the n's if needed, in view also of Lemma 3.1 we may assume that

lim
x-

¯n(x)

=

kn

and

lim
x+

¯n(x)

=

0

for some kn  -N.

Observe also that

sup |¯n|2 dx < + and sup |n|2 dx < + .

By replacing n with n(· - n, ·), ¯n with ¯n(· - n) and not renaming the minimizing sequence, we can

use

the

continuity

of

¯n(x)

and

conditions

at

infinity

to

make

sure

that

¯n(0)

It

follows

that

|¯n(x) - ¯n(0)| =

¯n(s) ds

Therefore, we have that ¯n is bounded in L2loc(R). Employing the Poincare inequality we deduce that n

is bounded in L2loc(). Thus we may apply [19, Lemma 1] to deduce that there exists   Hl1() and a subsequence (not relabelled) such that n  weakly in Hl1(), ¯n ¯ weakly in Hl1(R), and

and

Furthermore, testing n with (x, y) = (x), where   Cc(R), and passing to the limit, it is easy to see

that ¯(x) =

for

a.e.

In

addition,

using

In turn, by Lemma 3.1 there exist j1, j2  Z such that  satisfies (3.2), with k1, k2 replaced by j1, j2,

respectively, and

lim ¯(x) = j1,
x-

lim ¯(x) = j2 .
x+

Taking into account (4.35), it is clear that j1 = j2. It is now easy to check that m := (cos , sin )

is a solution to (4.33).

We are now ready to state the main -convergence result showing that (2.16) is the limiting energy of (2.10).

Theorem 4.9. Let  > 0 and h  0, and let E and E0 be defined by (2.13) and (2.16), respectively, on L2loc(; S2). Then the following two statements are true:
(i) (-lim inf inequality) Let m  M and m  m strongly in L2loc(; R2) as   0. Then

(4.36)

lim inf E(m)  E0(m) .
0

(ii) (-lim sup inequality) Let m  Hl1(; S1) be such that E0(m) < +. Then there exists m  M such that m  m in L2loc(; R2) as   0 and

lim sup E(m)  E0(m) .
0
Furthermore, if  and  are such that m = (cos , sin ) and m = (cos , sin ), then for every  sufficiently small we have

lim
x-

(x, ·) - k1

L2(0,1) = 0

and

lim
x-

(x, ·) - k2

L2(0,1) = 0,

where k1, k2  Z are as in (3.2).

Proof. Let us first prove the -liminf inequality. If lim inf0 E(m) = + there is nothing to prove. Hence we may assume without loss of generality that (after passing to a subsequence)

lim inf E(m) = lim E(m) < +.

0

0

Then, in particular, lim sup0 m L2() < + and thus m m  Hl1(; S1) weakly in Hl1(; R2). Inequality (4.36) then follows from the Proposition 4.6 (see (4.22)) and from the lower semicontinuity of

the local terms in the energies.

Let us now establish the upper bound. Let m and  be as in the second part of the statement. Then

by Lemma 4.1 we have m  M, and by Lemma 3.1 there exists k1, k2  Z such that (3.2) holds true. Now, arguing as in the proof of (3.17) one can construct a sequence {n} with the following properties:

i) for every n there exists Mn > 0 such that

n(x, y) = k1 if x  -Mn and n(x, y) = k2 if x  Mn, ii) mn  m  L2loc(; R2), iii) setting mn := (cos n, sin n), we have
E0(mn) = F (n)  E0(m) = F () as n   .

Therefore, by a standard diagonal argument it is enough to prove the upper bound under the following additional assumption: there exists M > 0 such that

(x, y) = k1 if x  -M and (x, y) = k2 if x  M . Under such an assumption, the conclusion follows simply by taking m = m for all  and observing that

lim sup E(m)  E0(m) ,
0
thanks to Proposition 4.6 (see (4.23)).

Corollary 4.10. Let k  Z \ {0}. Then

lim inf E(m) = inf F (),

0 mA0k

Ak

where A0k := {m  M : m = (cos , sin ),   Ak}.

DOMAIN WALLS IN FERROMAGNETIC STRIPS

37

Proof. For simplicity of the presentation we provide the proof for k  N only. Using Theorem 4.9, we
know that for any fixed ¯  Ak such that F (¯) < + we may find m = (cos , sin )  A0k such that  ¯ weakly in Hl1() and E(m)  F (¯). Thus,

lim sup inf E(m)  lim E(m) = F (¯).

0 mA0k

0

By the arbitrariness of ¯  Ak, we obtain

lim sup inf E(cos , sin )  inf F ().

0 Ak

Ak

For the reverse inequality, let m = (cos , sin )  A0k be a sequence such that

(4.37)

lim E(m) = lim inf inf E(m).

0

0 mA0k

Then for  small enough we may use Corollary 4.5 to get

lim sup  L2() + sin  L2() + sin  L2() < + .
0
On the other hand, for any   (0, 1), using inequality (4.4) from Proposition 4.4 and denoting by C a positive constant independent of j and  (that may change from inequality to inequality) we have

C E(m)  F () - | ln |



2 L2 ()

| ln |

Taking the limit as   0 and recalling (4.37), we obtain

lim inf inf E(m)  inf F () - C.

0 mA0k

Ak

The conclusion then follows from the arbitrariness of .

Corollary 4.11. Let   0 and let {m} be a sequence of minimizers for problem (4.33). Then, after suitable translations in the x-variable and up to a subsequence (not relabelled), we have m  m0  Hl1(; S1) strongly in Hl1(; R2), where m0 is a solution to (2.17). Moreover,
lim E(m) = E0(m0).
0
Proof. Note that by Corollary 4.5 we have

(4.38)

lim sup E0(m) < + .
0

In turn, by Lemma 3.1, without loss of generality, we may associate to each m a phase function  satisfying (3.7).

We may now argue exactly as in Proposition 4.8 (with  in place of n) to deduce the existence of 0  Hl1() and of j1, j2  Z, j1 = j2 such that (3.2) holds with , k1, k2 replaced by 0, j1, j2, respectively, and

 0 weakly in Hl1() ,

up to a subsequence (not relabelled). Set now m0 := (cos 0, sin 0). The fact that m0 is a solution of (2.17) and the convergence of energies follows from a standard -convergence argument in view of Theorem 4.9. In turn, the convergence of energies implies strong convergence of m in Hl1(; R2).

Corollary 4.11 combined with Corollaries 3.10, 3.3 and 4.10 easily yields that for  small enough the minimization in (4.33) is achieved by at most single winding. Precisely, we have:

Corollary 4.12. There exists 1 > 0 such that for   (0, 1) any minimizer m = (cos , sin ) of (4.33) is such that  satisfies (3.2) for some k1(), k2()  Z, with |k1() - k2()| = k, where k = 1 if h = 0 or k = 2 if h > 0. Moreover, after suitable translations we have

(4.39)

sgn(k1() - k2())( - k2())  min strongly in Hl1() as   0,

where min is the unique (up to translations) minimizer from Theorem 2.3.

Proof. We provide a proof for h = 0 only. Let  > 0 be small enough and m = (cos , sin ) be a minimizer of (4.33). Using Corollary 4.7 and Lemma 3.1, we know that there exist k1(), k2()  N such that

(4.40)

lim
x-

(x, ·) - k1()

L2(0,1) = 0 and

lim
x+

(x, ·) - k2()

L2(0,1) = 0 .

Employing Corollary 4.11, we also know that (after a suitable translation) m  m0 strongly in Hl1() for a subsequence of   0, where m0 is a minimizer of (2.17). We want to show that |k1() - k2()|  1. Assume this is not the case, then there exists a further subsequence k  0 such that either: (a) |k1(k) - k2(k)|  n  Z+ \ {1} or (b) |k1(k) - k2(k)|  .
In case (a), we see that there exists 1 > 0 such that for all k < 1 we have |k1(k) - k2(k)| = n and therefore (after a suitable shift of k by k2(k)) we obtain mk (cos k , sin k ) with k  An. Since mk minimizes (4.33), we cannot have n = 0. Furthermore, since mk is a minimizer of (4.33) we obtain limk Ek (mk ) = limk infmAn Ek (m). Using Corollary 4.10 and Corollary 3.3, we obtain that

lim

contradicting the convergence of energies in Corollary 4.11.

In case (b), we assume without loss of generality that k2() = 0 and k1() > 0. We note that since k1()  , the function ¯k = min{n, k } for any fixed n  N yields F (k )  F (¯k ). Using Corollary 4.11, we know that Ek (mk ) < C and therefore by employing Proposition 4.4 and Corollary 4.5 we obtain

for any   (0, 1). Finally, taking n = 2 and noting that ¯k  An we deduce, using Corollary 3.3, that

lim infk Ek (mk )  2(1-)F (min) > F (min) for  small enough, and again we have a contradiction

with the convergence of energies in Corollary 4.11.

Finally, strong convergence of sgn(k1() - k2())( - k2()) to min in Hl1() follows from Corol-

lary 4.11 and uniqueness of the minimizer of the limit problem.

Proof of Theorem 2.9. To conclude, the assertion of Theorem 2.9 is an immediate consequence of Corollary 4.12.

Appendix A. Poisson kernel, Dirichlet-to-Neumann map and Dirichlet energy on a strip
Here we provide the details of the computation that leads to (1.10) and (3.64) for the convenience of the reader (see also, e.g., [66]). We start by noting that the symmetry of minimizers with respect to the

We next minimize F in (A.1) with respect to  satisfying the first of (A.2) with a fixed ¯  C(R)

obeying

(1.9).

This

amounts

to

choosing



to

the

extension

of

that

satisfies

the

boundary conditions in (A.2). Notice that by standard elliptic regularity theory we have   Cm(R×[0, 1])

for every m  N under our assumption on ¯, and (x, y) decays exponentially to the respective limits

together with all its derivatives as x  ±.

Let

(A.3)

^(k, y) := e-ikx(x, y) dx

be the one-dimensional Fourier transform of  in the x-variable, understood in the sense of tempered

distributions. The function ^(k, y) solves

where we noted that the regularity and decay of  allows us to interchange the order of differentiation and an application of the Fourier transform distributionally. The solution of the above boundary value problem in terms of the boundary data is

(A.5)

^(k, y)

=

cosh(k(

cosh(

^(k, 0),

and upon inverting the Fourier transform we can write

(A.6) where (A.7)

(x, y) = P (x - x , y) ¯(x ) dx ,
R
2 cosh(x) sin(y) P (x, y) :=

Notice that by

direct

inspection the formula in (A.6) remains valid if, for example, ¯  C(R)  L(R) (see also [66]).

By square integrability of |(·, y)| for  given by (A.6) and Fubini theorem, we conclude that the

and note that 0 > K^(k) K^ (k) as  0. Also, in view of the fact that K^(k)^(k, 0) = y^(k, ) and (A.6), the inverse Fourier transform of K^(k) reads

(A.11)

2 cos() cosh(x)(cos(2) + cosh(2x) - 2)

K(x) =

(cos(2) - cosh(2x))2

.

In particular, passing to the limit   0 yields K(x) = lim0 K(x), where K is given by (1.11). Lastly, the expression for the energy in (1.10) follows from (A.8) by an appropriate limiting argument
with the help of an observation that

where we noted that R K(x) dx = K^(0) = 0 and, hence, the function v(x) := R K(x - x ) ¯(x ) dx is smooth and exhibits exponential decay as |x|  . Indeed, we can pass to the limit in the left-hand

side of (A.12) by monotone convergence theorem to obtain the first term in the right-hand side of (A.8).

At the same time, as can be easily seen we have |K(x)|  K(x) for all 0 <  <

Therefore, we can

pass to the limit in the right-hand side of (A.12) with the help of the dominated convergence theorem.
