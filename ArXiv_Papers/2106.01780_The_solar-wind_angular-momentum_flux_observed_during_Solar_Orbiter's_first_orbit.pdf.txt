ABSTRACT
Aims. We present the first measurements of the solar-wind angular-momentum flux recorded by the Solar Orbiter spacecraft. Our aim is the validation of these measurements to support future studies of the Sun's angular-momentum loss. Methods. We combine 60-minute averages of the proton bulk moments and the magnetic field measured by the Solar Wind Analyser (SWA) and the magnetometer (MAG) onboard Solar Orbiter. We calculate the angular-momentum flux per solid-angle element using data from the first orbit of the mission's cruise phase during 2020. We separate the contributions from protons and from magnetic stresses to the total angular-momentum flux. Results. The angular-momentum flux varies significantly over time. The particle contribution typically dominates over the magneticfield contribution during our measurement interval. The total angular-momentum flux shows the largest variation and is typically anticorrelated with the radial solar-wind speed. We identify a compression region, potentially associated with a co-rotating interaction region or a coronal mass ejection, that leads to a significant localised increase in the angular-momentum flux, yet without a significant increase in the angular momentum per unit mass. We repeat our analysis using the density estimate from the Radio and Plasma Waves (RPW) instrument. Using this independent method, we find a decrease in the peaks of positive angular-momentum flux but otherwise consistent results. Conclusions. Our results largely agree with previous measurements of the solar-wind angular-momentum flux in terms of amplitude, variability, and dependence on radial solar-wind bulk speed. Our analysis highlights the potential for future, more detailed, studies of the solar wind's angular momentum and its other large-scale properties with data from Solar Orbiter. We emphasise the need to study the radial evolution and latitudinal dependence of the angular-momentum flux in combination with data from Parker Solar Probe and assets at heliocentric distances of 1 au and beyond.

1. Introduction
The solar corona expands into interplanetary space in the form of the solar wind (Parker 1958; Neugebauer & Snyder 1962; Verscharen et al. 2019). In this process, the solar-wind plasma removes mass, momentum, energy, and angular momentum from

the Sun. In the lower corona, the Sun's magnetic field forces the plasma into a quasi-rigid co-rotation with the photosphere, following the co-rotation of the field's photospheric footpoints. With increasing distance from the photosphere, the torque exerted by the coronal magnetic field on the plasma decreases (Weber & Davis 1967). In this way, the large-scale magnetic field

mediates a smooth transition from co-rotation to quasi-radial expansion. Therefore, the solar wind is not "flung" from the photosphere on a ballistic trajectory, which would lead to a torque-free azimuthal velocity profile of the form

R2  sin 

U(r)

, r

(1)

where R is the solar radius,  is the Sun's angular rotation frequency,  is the co-latitude, and r is the heliocentric distance. Instead, the solar wind experiences a significant torque in its acceleration region at even larger distances from the photosphere, leading to greater azimuthal speeds than predicted by Eq. (1). In turn, the torque applied to the Sun by the magnetic field in this process slows down the Sun's rotation on long time scales (Mestel 1968; Reiners & Mohanty 2012). Local measurements of the solar-wind angular-momentum flux provide an estimate for the global angular-momentum loss rate, which ultimately causes the rotation period of the Sun and, by extrapolation, of Sun-like stars on the main sequence to increase with age (Barnes 2003; Gallet & Bouvier 2013; Matt et al. 2015; Pantolmos & Matt 2017).
Measurements of the solar-wind angular-momentum flux are particularly challenging from an instrumental point of view. They require an accurate determination of the azimuthal component U of the particle bulk velocity, which is typically more than one order of magnitude less than its radial component Ur. Nevertheless, early measurements of the solar wind already estimated its angular momentum (Hundhausen et al. 1970; Lazarus & Goldstein 1971; Pizzo et al. 1983; Marsch & Richter 1984). Modern space instrumentation provides us with higher spacecraft-pointing accuracy and thus a more accurate determination of U. Moreover, as the average ratio U/Ur increases with decreasing heliocentric distance, the error in the quantification of the angular-momentum flux is generally smaller when measured at smaller distances from the Sun (Finley et al. 2020, 2021). In addition, co-rotating interaction regions have not yet formed (Richter & Luttrell 1986; Allen et al. 2020), and interplanetary coronal mass ejections have not fully expanded to disturb nearby wind streams (Möstl et al. 2020) at small distances from the Sun. Therefore, near-Sun measurements enable the sampling of more pristine and less processed solar wind. Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe share the advantages of both modern space instrumentation and an orbit that leads them close to the Sun (Fox et al. 2016; Müller et al. 2020). We present the first observations of the solar wind's angular-momentum flux observed by Solar Orbiter during the first orbit of its cruise phase in 2020.

The calculation of the angular-momentum flux is very sensitive to knowledge uncertainties in the direction of the bulk velocity and in the direction of the magnetic field. The finite angular resolution of PAS introduces an uncertainty in the knowledge of the bulk-speed direction. The calibration accuracy of PAS is
1. The pointing knowledge of the MAG sensor is largely determined by the uncertainty of the spacecraft's boom deployment angle. It introduces an angular uncertainty of the magnetic-field measurement of 1. Planned inter-instrument alignment reconstructions of the boom orientation will become feasible in the future once the instruments have recorded sufficient amounts of data for a large statistical analysis (Walsh et al. 2020). For solarwind speeds above 300 km s-1, the relative uncertainty of the SWA/PAS speed measurement due to counting statistics is less than 1%. The relative uncertainty of the density measurement is energy-dependent with a maximum of 20%, which we apply as a conservative estimate to our entire dataset. At very low energies (corresponding to solar-wind speeds below  300 km s-1), the sensitivity decreases further so that additional correction factors are required, which have not been conclusively determined yet. The expected MAG offset is  ±0.1 nT, which we take as the absolute uncertainty of our individual magnetic-field component measurements. The requirement of the absolute knowledge error of the spacecraft pointing is  3 arcmin (García Marirrodriga et al. 2021), which is mostly driven by the instrument requirements of the remote-sensing suite and a minor contributor to the pointing knowledge uncertainties for our study.
We base our analysis on the PAS normal-mode ground moments integrated from the proton part (core and beam) of the full three-dimensional measured ion distributions and the MAG normal-mode vectors of the magnetic field. In normal mode, the PAS ground moments are available every 4 seconds, while the MAG vectors are available with a cadence of 8 vectors per second. We merge and average both data products over intervals of length 60 min to reduce natural fluctuations in the data due to, for example, waves and turbulence, as we are interested in the angular-momentum flux of the bulk solar wind. Our selection and averaging procedure leaves us with 1036 individual data points.
The angular momentum is contained in the mechanical flux of the solar-wind particles. In addition, there is transport of angular momentum due to magnetic-field stresses. Ignoring anisotropies in the particle distributions and contributions from particles other than protons1, the total angular-momentum flux is thus the sum of the proton and magnetic-field terms (see Marsch & Richter 1984). We define the total angular-momentum flux per solid-angle element in spherical heliocentric coordinates as

Ftot = Fp + FB,

2. Data analysis

where

We analyse a combined set of data from the Proton-Alpha Sensor (PAS) of Solar Orbiter's Solar Wind Analyser (SWA, Owen et al. 2020) suite and from Solar Orbiter's fluxgate magnetometer (MAG, Horbury et al. 2020). Our dataset includes all time intervals from 2020-07-07 until 2020-10-27, for which both SWA/PAS and MAG data are available. We ignore all other intervals and those in which the quality flags for either dataset indicate poor data quality (we only include data with a quality flag of 3). After this selection, we thus retain about 38.9% of the total time interval in our dataset (for time coverage, see also Figure 1). During this time, Solar Orbiter recorded data at heliocentric distances between 0.591 and 0.989 au. The time average of the spacecraft's heliocentric distance in our dataset is 0.851 au.

magnetic field. The subscript r indicates the radial vector component, and the subscript  indicates the azimuthal component in spherical heliocentric coordinates. We use our 60-minute averages of the measured solar-wind parameters as the input for our calculations of Fp and FB according to Equations (3) and (4). We recognise that our analysis represents only a first validation of methods to study angular-momentum flux with Solar Orbiter. Therefore, it ignores other contributions to the total angular-momentum flux (see Section 4), which must be investigated in future detailed studies.

observed fast-wind intervals (Ur > 500 km s-1). A similar behaviour has been seen in Parker Solar Probe measurements (Fin-
ley et al. 2021). In the separated data subsets for slow wind and
fast wind, the mean values of |Fp| are greater than the mean value of |Fp| in our full dataset of all measurements. The means of FB are positive, independent of our categorisation by wind speed,
and the mean value of FB in our slow-wind and fast-wind intervals is less than the mean value of FB in all measurement intervals. We note, however, that the mean value of FB is very small for the separated slow-wind and fast-wind intervals, so that this
result is potentially not significant (see also Figure 5).

3. Results
3.1. Timeseries and overview
Figure 1 shows the timeseries of Fp, FB, and Ftot over the analysed data interval. Gaps in this plot represent data gaps or those intervals that we exclude according to our selection criteria. Figure 1 illustrates the natural variation of the angularmomentum flux over time, which is typically greater than its mean magnitude. Across all data points, the mean value of Fp is 2.29 × 10-11 au3 g cm-1 s-2 sr-1, while the mean value of FB is 1.72 × 10-11 au3 g cm-1 s-2 sr-1. In general, Fp exhibits significantly more variation than FB. As expected for a conserved quantity, Ftot shows no secular dependence on heliocentric distance.
On 2020-09-06, we record a time interval of significantly increased Fp and Ftot. Upon closer inspection, this interval corresponds to a time of increased , probably associated with the compression in front of a co-rotating interaction region or a coronal mass ejection seen as a flux rope in the magnetic field. Due to this enhancement in , the associated plasma carries more angular-momentum flux than the solar wind before or after the compression region. The compression region does not exhibit enhancements in Ur or U (not shown here), suggesting that the compression region facilitates a similar angular-momentum flux per unit mass as the solar wind. Figure 6 supports this suggestion as discussed below. We highlight the measurements taken during the time interval associated with this compression region in our figures as magenta squares.

3.3. Speed dependence of the angular-momentum flux

Figure 4 shows our measurements of Fp as a function of Ur. This visualisation confirms the significant Ur-dependence of the angular-momentum flux, which has been noted in previous stud-
ies and is discussed further in Section 4. The particle contri-
bution to the angular-momentum flux shows a stronger relative
variation in slow wind compared to fast wind. We also observe a
trend towards negative values of Fp (and thus Ftot) at larger Ur. Figure 5 shows the same but for FB. The magnetic-field contribution does not follow the same clear trend in its Ur-dependence as Fp. Figures 4 and 5 include horizontal and vertical error bars to represent Ur, Fp, and FB. The error bars follow from error propagation of the individual measurement uncertainties quoted
in Section 2, which corresponds to the application of the stan-
dard error of the mean based on the individual uncertainties. We find that, in our hourly averages, the relative errors Ur, Fp, and FB are negligible.
A comparison of the magenta points in Figures 4 and 5 re-
veals that FB is not enhanced in the compression region compared to the time intervals outside the compression region. We
note that the unit on the vertical axis in Figure 5 is one order of
magnitude smaller than the unit on the vertical axis in Figure 4.
This reflects again that Fp is on average the dominant contribution to Ftot. In order to quantify the Ur-dependence, we apply least-squares Marquardt­Levenberg fits to our measurements ac-
cording to the linear equation

F = aUr + b

(5)

3.2. Variability of the angular-momentum flux
In Figures 2 and 3, we show histograms of the measured values of Fp and FB in our dataset in terms of their probability distributions. We colour-code the contributions from fast, intermediate, and slow solar wind in our histograms. Due to the dominance of Fp, the histogram of the probability distribution for Ftot (not shown) is almost identical with the histogram for Fp. Both histograms reflect the large variation in the angular-momentum flux and the range of observed values. According to Figure 2, the majority distribution is centred around negative values of Fp, while the outliers at large Fp shift the mean of our measurements to Fp > 0. These outliers are mostly associated with the compression region on 2020-09-06.
For a more quantitative statistical analysis, we list the mean values, the standard deviations, as well as the maximum and minimum values of Fp, FB, and Ftot in Table 1. In addition, Table 1 provides these statistical markers separated by time intervals with Ur < 400 km s-1 and Ur > 500 km s-1 as a means to distinguish characteristic slow wind from fast wind, respectively. We find that Fp > 0 and Ftot > 0 in the observed slow-wind intervals (Ur < 400 km s-1), while Fp < 0 and Ftot < 0 in the

3.4. Mass-flux dependence of the angular-momentum flux

We define the proton mass flux per solid-angle element as

Gp = r2Ur.

(6)

As Fp is carried by the proton flow, we combine Fp and Gp in Figure 6 and analyse their dependence. We colour-code each
measurement point with its associated value of Ur, which allows us to link Figure 6 with Figure 4. All time intervals with Gp 2 × 10-15 au2 g cm-2 s-1 sr-1 in our dataset exhibit Fp > 0. The majority of these points correspond to the compression re-
gion on 2020-09-06. We highlight them as magenta squares in
Figure 6, illustrating that the mass-flux dependence is a useful
method to separate transient and atypical plasma intervals from
the regular background solar wind (see also Stansby et al. 2019).
The value of rU is a measure of the local specific angular momentum per proton. Since Fp = rUGp, isocontours of constant rU correspond to bent curves when using a logarithmic

Gp-axis in Figure 6. We show these isocontours as grey dashed curves for a range of rU values from ±10 to ±40 au km s-1. At the low-Gp end, the distribution scatters almost symmetrically around a value of Fp = 0. The envelope of the distribution in this
Gp range follows isocontours of constant ± rU , meaning that the scatter in Fp is well defined by a fixed range of constant magnitudes of the angular momentum per proton. At intermediate Gp, the symmetry around Fp = 0 breaks, and more data points occur at Fp > 0. At Fp > 0, the envelope of the data distribution in terms of rU decreases as Gp increases in the intermediate-Gp range. The points representing the compression region largely
lie on the same isocontours of rU as the bulk of the slow solar

wind. This behaviour suggests that the increase in Fp associated with the compression region is mostly due to an increase in  rather than to an increase in the specific angular momentum per proton compared to the regular slow wind.
3.5. Spectral analysis of angular-momentum flux
Solar Orbiter's high time resolution in the measurement of both the particles and the magnetic field enables the analysis of the power spectrum of the variable angular-momentum flux over a wide range of frequencies. In order to demonstrate the suitability of Solar Orbiter data for future studies of this type, we present such a spectral analysis of the angular-momentum flux based on our dataset. We apply a non-uniform fast Fourier transform (Barnett et al. 2019; Barnett 2021) to the timeseries data of Fp and FB throughout our entire dataset. For this calculation, we use 1minute averages of the data instead of the 60-minute averages used in our study otherwise. This choice allows us to explore the variability of Fp and FB over a wider range of frequencies. Figure 7 shows the resulting power spectral densities (PSDs) of Fp and FB as functions of frequency .

We find PSD(Fp) -0.45±0.12 in the low- regime and PSD(Fp) -1.448±0.012 in the high- regime. Likewise, PSD(FB) -0.49±0.14 in the low- regime and PSD(FB) -1.377±0.012 in the high- regime. We overplot the fit results in Figure 7.

Our measurements of |Fp| are largely in agreement with previous measurements in the solar wind, which reveal values of about 4.4 . . . 5.9 × 10-11 au3 g cm-1 s-2 sr-1 (Pizzo et al. 1983), 4.4 . . . 11.2 × 10-11 au3 g cm-1 s-2 sr-1 (Finley et al. 2020), and 1.09 . . . 2.43 × 10-10 au3 g cm-1 s-2 sr-1 (Liu et al. 2021) as averages over their whole datasets.

data from Wind and Parker Solar Probe (Finley et al. 2019, 2020, 2021) and with estimates based on the observation of the Earth's magnetotail deflection (Nemecek et al. 2020). The observation of this trend in near-Sun data suggests that the trend is generated close to the Sun and not by local deflections at large distances. On average, Fp > 0 for Ur 376 km s-1 and Fp < 0 for Ur 376 km s-1 according to our fit result applied to the data shown in Figure 4. The magnetic-field contribution FB shows only a small dependence on Ur, which is consistent with recent measurements from Parker Solar Probe (Liu et al. 2021).
Averaged over very long timescales, we expect both the particle contribution and the magnetic-field contribution to the angular-momentum flux to be positive due to the Sun's sense of rotation and the direction of the average Parker (1958) field.

In addition, we anticipate an overall loss of the Sun's angular momentum based on observed trends in the rotation periods of Sun-like stars, which decrease with age along the main sequence. This finding is generally interpreted as a consequence of magnetised stellar winds (Lorenzo-Oliveira et al. 2019; do Nascimento et al. 2020). In the Sun's specific case, a positive net Ftot corresponds to a net loss of the Sun's rotational angular momentum.
Moreover, we expect the average relative contribution of FB to the total angular-momentum flux to decrease slightly with increasing heliocentric distance as magnetic stress is converted into particle angular momentum (Weber & Davis 1967), although Marsch & Richter (1984) do not find clear evidence for this behaviour within 1 au. Previous measurements of FB reveal values of about 4.1 . . . 4.7 × 10-11 au3 g cm-1 s-2 sr-1 (Pizzo et al. 1983), 3.6 . . . 4.7 × 10-11 au3 g cm-1 s-2 sr-1 (Finley et al. 2020), and 2.1 . . . 3.8 × 10-11 au3 g cm-1 s-2 sr-1 (Liu et al. 2021) as averages over their whole datasets at small heliocentric distances. These values are indeed greater than our mean values measured at Solar Orbiter's distances from the Sun, consistent with an average transfer of angular momentum from the

field to the particles taking place between 0.3 and 0.7 au. Averaged over two solar cycles, Finley et al. (2019) find FB  3.58 × 10-11 au3 g cm-1 s-2 sr-1 in data from the Wind spacecraft at 1 au. Comparing to the averages at small heliocentric distances, this 1-au long-term average is also consistent with an overall decreasing trend of FB with increasing r. We note, however, that our average FB at intermediate distances is even smaller than the 1-au long-term average from Wind. This discrepancy is probably the result of the limited statistics in our dataset and the specific solar wind streams encountered by Solar Orbiter during its first orbit at this particular phase of the solar cycle. Radial alignments between Solar Orbiter, Parker Solar Probe, and potentially other assets with suitable pointing accuracy and instrumentation will help us to understand the partition of the contributions to the angular-momentum flux over longer time intervals in the future. In general, we expect a significant dependence of the angular-momentum flux on the Sun's 11year activity cycle based on changes to the global magnetic field strength and changing solar-wind source regions (Finley et al. 2018).
Notwithstanding these expectations regarding large-scale behaviour, our measurements reveal the large variation of the angular-momentum flux over many timescales from a few hours to months. Taking our full measurement time interval into account, the relative variations in Fp are greater than the relative variations in FB. When separating fast and slow wind, however, the relative variations in FB are greater than those in Fp both in the intervals with slow (Ur < 400 km s-1) and in the intervals with fast (Ur > 500 km s-1) solar wind. A potential reason for this behaviour lies in the fact that FB does not directly depend on Ur, while Fp changes significantly with Ur (see Figures 4 and 5). We attribute the natural variations in the angular-momentum flux to changes in the solar-wind source regions (Schwenn 2006; Tindale & Chapman 2017), deflections during the expansion (Egidi et al. 1969; Siscoe et al. 1969), or large-scale fluctuations as part of the turbulent spectrum (Tu & Marsch 1995; Bruno & Carbone 2013). Furthermore, the complex field and flow geometries in the low corona and latitudinal variations of the source regions create variations in Ftot (Finley & Matt 2017; Réville & Brun 2017; Boe et al. 2020; Finley et al. 2020).
Figure 6 confirms that the scatter of data points around Fp = 0 is more symmetric in the tenuous, low-Gp wind than in the denser, high-Gp wind. Assuming that all wind is ejected from the Sun with positive Fp due to the Sun's sense of rotation2, negative Fp can only be created by local stream interactions, which in turn must increase Fp of neighbouring plasma in order to fulfil angular-momentum conservation. Our observation of a more symmetric distribution around Fp = 0 at low Gp is then consistent with a scenario in which these local stream interactions occur more effectively in low-Gp wind. In this scenario, the mixing of Fp in low-Gp wind leaves the high-Gp wind as the main carrier of net angular-momentum flux. Figure 6 then suggests that most of the net angular-momentum flux in the solar wind is carried by dense slow wind with Fp > 0 in the intermediate-to-high-Gp range.
Our spectral analysis of Fp and FB in Section 3.5 quantifies the variations of the angular-momentum flux depending on frequency . The averaging time (60 minutes) for our analysis of the angular-momentum flux outside of Section 3.5 corresponds to  = 2.78 × 10-4 Hz, which lies well inside the accessible frequency range of the high- regime. Figure 7 does not exhibit
2 Realistically, the possibility exists that some wind streams are initiated with U < 0 at the Sun.

Daniel Verscharen et al.: The solar-wind angular-momentum flux observed during Solar Orbiter's first orbit

a clear peak at the frequency associated with the Sun's equatorial rotation frequency,  = 2  4.7 × 10-7 Hz. The lack of such a feature suggests that the variability of the angularmomentum flux induced by repeated passes of source regions due to the Sun's rotation is negligible in our dataset. However, a spectral analysis of variations on these long timescales is not fully reliable at this stage of the mission due to the short overall duration of the dataset and its patchiness. The smallest gaps in our dataset are of order a few minutes, while the longest gap is 18 days long. We note in this context that large-scale interplanetary structures such as co-rotating interaction regions, which could be responsible for variations on these timescales, typically decay after a few revolutions. The breakpoint at   10-5 Hz corresponds to a timescale of  28 h. Assuming that this variation is frozen into the solar-wind flow, this timescale corresponds to a convected length scale of  0.27 au according to Taylor's hypothesis (Taylor 1938) based on an average Ur  400 km s-1. This scale is greater than the typical correlation length in solarwind turbulence in the inner heliosphere (Matthaeus & Goldstein 1982; Bruno & Dobrowolny 1986; Bruno & Carbone 2013; Bourouaine et al. 2020). We note, however, that the uncertainty in the visual determination of the breakpoint frequency permits values between  6 × 10-6 Hz and  4 × 10-5 Hz due to the noise in our Fourier spectrum. Length scales within the corresponding range of breakpoint scales are still greater than the typical correlation length. In addition, the determination of the correlation length itself is to a certain degree method-dependent. Some estimates for the correlation length of velocity fluctuations provide the same order of magnitude as the length scale associated with our breakpoint in PSD(Fp) (Podesta et al. 2008), supporting the link between fluctuations in angular-momentum flux with the turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind. It is worthwhile to perform a scale-dependent study of the angular-momentum flux in the future, especially by separating the variations in the low- regime and in the high- regime.
Sporadic events, such as the compression on 2020-09-06, contribute to the natural variations of the angular-momentum flux. We do not remove events like these from our statistical analysis, although they introduce a bias as seen in Figures 1 and 2. The on-average greater variations in slow solar wind are reflected by the greater variation of the proton contribution Fp to the angular-momentum flux at small Ur in Figure 4. The mass-flux dependence of Fp during the time interval associated with the compression region in Figure 6 reveals a way to separate dense intermittent structures for future analyses. Using this method, it will be interesting to investigate the contribution of co-rotating interaction regions, coronal mass ejections, and other transient mass-flux enhancements to the Sun's long-term angular-momentum loss. In fact, the amount of angular momentum carried by coronal mass ejections is still not well known. Since angular momentum is conserved, however, local angularmomentum enhancements by the deflection of background solar wind must be balanced via flows with opposite angular momentum elsewhere in space. Figure 6 shows that the compression region in our dataset carries approximately the same specific angular momentum per proton, rU, as the regular slow wind, yet with a higher density. This observation suggests that the compression region represents "scooped-up" solar-wind mass, which has not undergone a significant alteration in terms of the particle's angular momentum. As shown in Figure 5, the value of FB in the compression region is comparable to the average value of FB across our dataset. This observation supports our interpretation of the compression region as a density increase of otherwise unaltered background solar wind. Composition measurements of

solar-wind transients have the potential to confirm this interpretation in the future.
Our measurements neglect the contribution of -particles to the angular-momentum flux. Given that their contribution to the local momentum flux is of order 20% (even greater near the Sun), -particles can make a significant contribution to the total angular-momentum flux (Pizzo et al. 1983; Marsch & Richter 1984; Verscharen et al. 2015; Finley et al. 2021). Both Finley et al. (2021) and Liu et al. (2021) suggest a reconstruction of the -particle component based on the field-alignment of the differential flow between protons and -particles. It is still an open question, however, whether the -particles are in general a net source of positive or negative angular-momentum flux. In addition, the proton beam component can carry a significant angular momentum flux (Finley et al. 2021), which we directly subsume through our using of total proton moments for  and U. Our analysis also neglects stresses due to pressure anisotropies in the particle populations (Hundhausen 1970; Marsch et al. 1982; Verscharen et al. 2019). This contribution to the angular-momentum flux is not significant for most of the solar-wind plasma though.
At this early stage of the mission, it is difficult to quantify the measurement uncertainties of the instruments accurately. These estimates will become more reliable as the mission progresses. At Ur 300 km s-1, the sensitivity of SWA/PAS decreases, so that the uncertainty in the proton moments increases. Therefore, we urge caution regarding the interpretation of the proton data (especially, the proton density) in this velocity range, which includes the compression region. Solar Orbiter's Radio and Plasma Waves (RPW, Maksimovic et al. 2020) instrument provides an estimate of the local electron density based on the probe-to-spacecraft potential and quasi-thermal noise measurements (Khotyaintsev et al. 2021) which is independent of the SWA/PAS density measurement. We find that, especially during intervals with low Ur, SWA/PAS provides a greater density value than RPW. In Appendix A, we repeat part of our analysis using the independent RPW density estimate. Although we find a reduction in the peaks of Fp when using the RPW density, our conclusions hold regardless of the used density measurement. RPW is also able to provide an independent measurement of |U| from the bias DC electric field combined with the measurement of |B| from MAG. A careful cross-calibration between SWA/PAS and RPW both in terms of density and bulk-speed measurements will improve further studies in the future (Owen et al. 2020; Maksimovic et al. 2020; Walsh et al. 2020).
Early results from Parker Solar Probe report an increased azimuthal flow of the protons compared to the expectation of the Weber & Davis (1967) model at heliocentric distances up to about 0.23 au (Kasper et al. 2019). Possible explanations for this observed "angular-momentum paradox" (Réville et al. 2020) include the partitioning of angular-momentum flux between the different particle species, non-axisymmetric flows and pressure gradients, and pressure anisotropies. In our data, however, we do not find evidence for such a persistent positive azimuthal flow, albeit our data were recorded at distances greater than 0.59 au and show a different distribution of solar-wind speeds compared to the study by Kasper et al. (2019). In the future, when Solar Orbiter's perihelion distance is reduced, it will be important to monitor the azimuthal flow of the protons more closely to compare with Parker Solar Probe's findings of super-rotational flows in the near-Sun solar wind.

5. Concluding remarks A reliable quantification of the Sun's global angular-momentum loss requires measurements of the angular-momentum flux over long time intervals. In addition, we require distinctive measurements of typical equatorial and polar solar wind (McComas et al. 2000; Verscharen et al. 2021) to complete the understanding of the global angular-momentum loss. At this early point in the mission, we cannot confidently ascertain our measurement interval as a representative sample of the solar wind's angularmomentum flux. Further long-term studies will become available during Solar Orbiter's mission lifetime. In later stages of the mission, the spacecraft will leave the plane of the ecliptic making observations of the angular-momentum flux of polar solar wind feasible. Nevertheless, our study already confirms the potential for future detailed studies of the large-scale properties of the solar wind with the data from Solar Orbiter.

Appendix A: The angular-momentum and mass flux
based on the RPW density
RPW measures the local total electron density ne based on a combination of both the peak-tracking of the plasma fre-
quency and the spacecraft potential (Khotyaintsev et al. 2021).
Due to quasi-neutrality, ne serves as an independent measure of the total charge-weighted ion density. For comparison with our SWA/PAS-MAG measurements, we create a new dataset using U from SWA/PAS, B from MAG, and  = mpne from RPW, where mp is the proton mass. We apply the same selection, averaging, and analysis methods as in the main part of this work. This leaves us with 913 data points for our combined SWA/PAS-MAG-RPW dataset in total.
We show the timeseries of our combined SWA/PAS-MAGRPW dataset in Figure A.1. Qualitatively, the timeseries agrees with Figure 1. However, the peaks with Fp > 0 are less pronounced in the SWA/PAS-MAG-RPW dataset than in the SWA/PAS-MAG dataset. These peaks, including our compression region on 2020-09-06, correspond to intervals of slow and dense solar wind, for which the SWA/PAS and RPW densities diverge most.
We present the statistical properties of our combined SWA/PAS-MAG-RPW dataset in Table A.1. Due to the lower peaks in Fp, the signs of the mean values for Fp and Ftot across our full dataset are now different from the signs of the SWA/PAS-MAG dataset shown in Table 1. The maxima of Fp and Ftot in Table A.1 are lower than those given in Table 1, reflecting the lower peaks seen in Figure A.1. All other statistical
markers in Table A.1 agree with our results shown in Table 1. We show the dependence of Fp on Gp for our combined
SWA/PAS-MAG-RPW dataset in Figure A.2. The comparison between Figures 6 and A.2 shows that most high-Gp measurements, including the compression region, shift towards smaller values of Gp when using the RPW density estimate. In addition, the compression region shifts towards smaller values of Fp. Notwithstanding these differences, our conclusions drawn based on Figure 6 are still valid.
