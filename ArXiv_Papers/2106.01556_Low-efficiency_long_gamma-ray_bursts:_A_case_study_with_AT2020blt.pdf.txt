ABSTRACT
The Zwicky Transient Facility recently announced the detection of an optical transient AT2020blt at redshift z = 2.9, consistent with the afterglow of a gamma-ray burst. No prompt emission was observed. We analyse AT2020blt with detailed models, showing the data are best explained as the afterglow of an on-axis long gamma-ray burst, ruling out other hypotheses such as a cocoon and a low-Lorentz factor jet. We search Fermi data for prompt emission, setting deeper upper limits on the prompt emission than in the original detection paper. Together with KONUS-Wind observations, we show that the gamma-ray efficiency of AT2020blt is 2.8%, lower than 98.4% of observed gammaray bursts. We speculate that AT2020blt and AT2021any belong to the low-efficiency tail of long gamma-ray burst distributions that are beginning to be readily observed due to the capabilities of new observatories like the Zwicky Transient Facility.

1. INTRODUCTION
The interaction of an ultra-relativistic jet launched in a gamma-ray burst with the surrounding interstellar medium is known to produce broadband synchrotron radiation referred to as an afterglow. Observed extensively in X rays, optical and radio, these phenomena are observationally confirmed to be linked to the collapse of massive stars and compact object mergers (e.g., Cano et al. 2017; Abbott et al. 2017).
Afterglows of gamma-ray bursts are predominantly observed following-up the prompt emission trigger. There are a few exceptional cases such as iPTF11gg (Cenko et al. 2012), iPTF14yb (Cenko et al. 2015), FIRSTJ141918 (Marcote et al. 2019), and AT2020blt (Ho et al. 2020). These transients were either independently detected from the prompt emission and later associated to a gamma-ray counterpart that were missed in low-latency (Cenko et al. 2015), initially believed to be observed off-axis, in which case the highenergy prompt emission was missed due to relativistic beaming (Marcote et al. 2019), or later shown to not be afterglows at all (Lee et al. 2020).
The transient AT2020blt (Ho et al. 2020) is a fastfading optical transient at z = 2.9 observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility without any high-energy trigger from gamma-ray satellites. This transient has characteristic features akin to afterglows from gamma-ray bursts and broadband observations in X rays, optical, and radio (Singer et al. 2020; Ho et al. 2020). However, the non-detection of prompt gamma-ray emission is puzzling. Ho et al. (2020) suggest that this non-detection may be due to one of three reasons: 1) The prompt emission expected in gamma-rays was weak or missed due to occultation by the Earth. 2) The transient was the after-

glow from an off-axis gamma-ray burst where the prompt gamma-rays were missed because of relativistic beaming. 3) AT2020blt was the afterglow of a dirty fireball, i.e., a gamma-ray burst with a low Lorentz factor ( 100), such that the optically-thick environment absorbed the gamma-ray photons.
Prompt gamma-ray emission observed for both long and short gamma-ray bursts is likely produced by internal dissipation in an ultra-relativistic jet (e.g., Kumar 1999). To produce a gamma-ray burst, the jet must be ultra-relativistic to avoided the compactness problem (Ruderman 1975), i.e., that gamma-ray photons are above the pair production threshold and should only be observable if the jet is moving ultra-relativistically. This theoretical constraint has led to the placement of lower limits on the initial bulk Lorentz factor of 0 100 (e.g., Lithwick & Sari 2001). The existence of relativistic jets following gamma-ray bursts has also been shown observationally, for e.g., through multi-wavelength observations of GRB 170817A (e.g., Mooley et al. 2018; Lamb et al. 2018).
As an ultra-relativistic jet passes through the stellar/ejecta envelope, it creates a cocoon of shocked material. If the jet stalls within this envelope then such a choked jet will dissipate energy into the surrounding bubble of matter, forming a quasi-spherical cocoon, that will produce minimal prompt gamma-ray emission (e.g., Gottlieb et al. 2018). The interaction of the jet and/or cocoon with the interstellar medium is ultimately responsible for producing the broadband afterglow we see following almost all gamma-ray bursts.
The broadband observations of GRB 170817A confirmed that a relativistic jet successfully broke out of the ejecta and that the jet was likely structured i.e., the energy and Lorentz factor of the jet had some angular dependence. Although the exact jet structure is unknown,

various phenomenological models such as a Gaussian or power-law structure can successfully explain the broadband afterglow observations of GRB 170817A (e.g., Troja et al. 2017; Lamb et al. 2018; Ryan et al. 2019). We note that although a jet without any angular dependence is possible (e.g., Aloy et al. 2005), it is unlikely as both the jet-launching mechanism and jet-breakout will likely produce some jet structure (e.g., Nakar 2019).
In this letter, we investigate why there was no detection of prompt gamma-rays from AT2020blt by analysing the multi-wavelength data from Ho et al. (2020) with detailed afterglow models. In Sec. 2, we use the multiwavelength observations and physical arguments to estimate when the associated gamma-ray burst happened. Using this estimated time, we fit the data with a structured-jet model and cocoon model. We introduce our structured-jet and cocoon models in Sec. 3 and perform Bayesian model selection to identify the more likely scenario. We explore the dirty fireball hypothesis by estimating the Lorentz factor in Sec. 4. We perform a sub-threshold search in Fermi data and discuss the efficiency of the unobserved prompt gamma-ray emission in Sec. 5. We discuss the implications of our results and conclude in Sec. 6. Our analysis suggests that AT2020blt is likely an on-axis low efficiency long gamma-ray burst. The lack of gamma-ray radiation can be attributed to the low radiative efficiency of AT2020blt. We find that the non detection in gamma rays with KONUS-Wind implies AT2020blt has a radiative efficiency 2.8%, weaker than 98.4% of the gamma-ray burst population.

2. ESTIMATING THE BURST TIME

AT2020blt was first observed in the r band on 28 January 2020, by the Zwicky Transient Facility (Bellm et al. 2019). Follow-up observations provided detections in g and i bands along with detections in radio and X rays (Ho et al. 2020; Singer et al. 2020). No coincident gamma-ray trigger was found (Ridnaia et al. 2020; Ho et al. 2020). The lack of a gamma-ray trigger implies that we do not know the burst time t0, which is critical for discerning physics and testing the various hypotheses in detail.
Ho et al. (2020) estimated the burst time by fitting a broken power-law simultaneously to the r, g and i band data assuming constant colour offsets. This allowed them to estimate t0 as January 28.18. However, by fitting for t0 with a broken power-law, Ho et al. (2020) have estimated the peak time of an afterglow tpeak. For a typical on-axis relativistic jet, this peak time is likely not significantly different to t0. However, for a mildly relativistic jet viewed on-axis, tpeak can be up to a few days after t0 (e.g., Sari & Piran 1999), while for an off-axis system, the peak time could be several months after t0 (e.g., Granot et al. 2002).
To investigate the reason for the lack of observed prompt gamma-ray emission with detailed afterglow models, we must first estimate the burst time more robustly. For a relativistic outflow viewed on-axis the peak timescale in optical is the deceleration timescale (e.g., Sari & Piran 1999)

tdec  90 s (1 + z)

Ek 10-2 cm-3 1/3 1050 erg nism

0

.

100

(1)

Here, Ek is the kinetic energy of the outflow, z is the redshift, nism is the interstellar medium density, and 0 is the initial Lorentz factor of the outflow. For an onaxis observer, the optical lightcurve is well modelled as a rising power-law till tdec (e.g., Sari & Piran 1999).
The location of AT2020blt was observed prior to the first detection on January 27th with an r band upper limit of > 21.36 mag. We use this non-detection combined with a rising power-law on the observed flux

F = A (t - t0)m ,

(2)

which describes the pre-deceleration physics, to estimate t0. We use broad uninformative priors on t0, tdec and fix A to ensure the pre-deceleration power-law smoothly connects with the observations. The prior on m is informed by physics and depends on whether the forward or reverse shock dominates, or on the thickness of the shells launched in the burst. To minimise the effect of the prior, we choose a broad uniform prior from 0.5-7.5, which covers all possible scenarios (e.g., Zhang 2018). We note that typical observed pre-deceleration behaviour follows m  3 (e.g., Zhang 2018). We examine whether the pre-deceleration power law would produce a signal above the upper limit on 27 January, ruling out the parameter space that violates this constraint.
The above analysis implies that if AT2020blt is observed on-axis (i.e., the assumption of pre-deceleration is correct) then we measure t0 = 58875.53+-00..3630 MJD i.e., Jan 27.53+-00..3630. This initial analysis can already offer some clues into the nature of AT2020blt. For shallow indices m 3, as would be expected for a cocoon or a relativistic jet where the forward shock dominates the pre-deceleration physics, a start time before  27 January can not explain the non-detection. While for steeper indices m 3 (i.e., where reverse shock emission dominates), the range of t0 is significantly broader, potentially as early as  26 January. We show our posterior on t0 and m in Fig 1.
The above deceleration analysis can also be extended to an off-axis observer. We emphasise that this latter physics is a consequence of relativistic beaming and not deceleration. A relativistic jet viewed off-axis will also rise with m 3. However, if the jet has an extended structure such that a significant fraction of the jet energy covers the observers' line of sight, the rise will be much shallower (e.g., Nakar 2019). This suggests that if AT2020blt was an off-axis afterglow, the observer must satisfy obs > 1/ at the time of the non-detection or for the gamma-ray burst to occur after the non-detection on 27 January. These two conditions combined with the steep late-time decay of AT2020blt suggests an off-axis interpretation is unfeasible.

3. AFTERGLOW CONSTRAINTS
If AT2020blt is the afterglow of a typical gamma-ray burst, the absence of observed gamma-ray emission immediately points towards two hypotheses: either the observer was off-axis, and therefore the prompt gamma-ray emission was missed due to relativistic beaming (e.g., Granot et al. 2002), or the jet did not successfully break through the ejecta and cocoon emission was responsible for producing the afterglow (e.g., Nakar & Piran 2017). We first test both these hypotheses by fitting the broad-

band afterglow to a power-law structured jet and cocoon model.

Here,  is the exponent dictating the slope of the power-
law jet structure, observer is the observers viewing angle, core is the half-width opening angle of the jet core. The Lorentz factor of the jet is proportional to E(observer)1/2 and Eiso is the on-axis isotropic equivalent energy. The cocoon model is a spherical outflow with velocity strati-
fication with an energy distribution,

Here, u is the dimensionless four-velocity, E0 is the kinetic energy of the fastest material, and k is the powerlaw index. Both the cocoon and structured jet outflows interact with the surrounding interstellar medium accelerating a fraction of electrons, n, with a fraction of the total energy, e, and the fraction of the energy in the magnetic field, b. The radiation produced by these electrons is responsible for the observed broadband afterglow.
We fit the multi-wavelength flux data of AT2020blt (including the upper-limits) using the power-law structured jet and cocoon model described above implemented in afterglowpy (Ryan et al. 2019) and a Gaussian likelihood. We include both synchrotron and inverse Compton emission and account for potential host galaxy extinction. We estimate the uncertainty on each data point as the quadrature sum of the measurement uncertainty

reported by Ho et al. (2020) and an estimated systematic uncertainty which we model. Our prior on this systematic uncertainty is uniform from 10-4 - 10-3 mJy. The values being motivated by the flux data. We infer the parameters of the system using Bilby (Ashton et al. 2019) and the dynesty sampler (Speagle 2020). Our fits to the broadband data are shown in Fig 2.
We find that the cocoon model does not explain the r-band data at late times well, while the structured-jet model can successfully explain all the observations. In particular, the last data point is a two sigma outlier from the posterior prediction for the cocoon model. Furthermore, given the pre-deceleration power-law exponent of a cocoon is m 3, to explain the observations with a cocoon the associated gamma-ray burst must have occurred after the non-detection on 27 January. This requires the cocoon emission to rise rapidly to explain the observations on 28 January, which is difficult (e.g., Nakar & Piran 2017).
More quantitatively, we perform Bayesian model selection between the two hypotheses. Assuming both models are equally likely a priori, the structured-jet model is  4 times more likely than the cocoon interpretation, favouring the hypothesis that an ultra-relativistic structured jet broke out of the ejecta and later interacted with the surrounding environment to produce AT2020blt.
Although we focus here on the power-law structured jet model for simplicity, we find a similar overwhelming preference for other jet models, including a Gaussian structured jet and a top-hat jet with Bayes factors of  4 and  6 in favour of the jet hypothesis respectively. We emphasise that these Bayes factors are predicated on the assumption that AT2020blt was a gamma-ray burst i.e., we are comparing the cocoon and structured jet hypotheses given AT2020blt is a gamma-ray burst. In Sec. 6, we speculate that it is possible, although unlikely, that AT2020blt may have a different origin, in which case this analysis would not be valid.
As we are also modelling the noise, another way to compare the model fit is by the size of the estimated noise. We find  = 7.7 × 10-4 and  = 8.2 × 10-4 for the power-law structured jet and cocoon models respectively, i.e., to fit the data with the cocoon model, we need the data to be noisier, suggesting that the structured-jet model is favoured over the cocoon.
The inability to explain the observations with a cocoon while successfully explaining the observations with a structured jet suggests AT2020blt had a successful jet breakout, as typical for most observed gamma-ray bursts. Therefore, the lack of observed prompt gamma-ray emission could be a consequence of relativistic beaming, i.e., that we observed AT2020blt outside the ultra-relativistic core. We test this hypothesis by fitting the structured jet models above with a broad uniform prior on t0 from 1 January 2019 to January 27.54 2020 (i.e., the first nondetection) and enforcing that the observer is located offaxis. We find that we can not fit the data well, with a Bayes factor of  8 × 1016 in favour of the on-axis hypothesis. This is likely due to the sharp rise required to explain the non-detection and first observation around 28 January and the subsequent steep decay, which is difficult with an observer located off-axis (e.g., Granot et al. 2002; Nakar 2019).

Wang et al. 2015; Fong et al. 2015).

These measurements suggest that AT2020blt is consis-

gamma-ray burst where the observer is located within

the ultra-relativistic core. This implies that the non-

detection of prompt gamma-ray emission cannot be due

off-axis.

Our results confirm that assuming AT2020blt was re-

lated to the gamma-ray burst phenomena, the data of

AT2020blt is best explained as the afterglow produced by

an on-axis jet that successfully broke out of the ejecta.

This implies that we can rule out the non-detection of

prompt gamma-ray emission due to relativistic beaming

or that the jet that produced AT2020blt did not success-

fully break out of the ejecta. We now explore whether

the jet launched in AT2020blt could produce prompt gamma-ray emission.

4. LORENTZ FACTOR
As discussed above, gamma-ray production requires a relativistic jet to alleviate the compactness problem (Ruderman 1975). Naturally, this implies that if a jet breaks out of the ejecta and it is not sufficiently relativistic (for potential explanations of non-relativistic jets see e.g., Huang et al. (2002)), the jet will not produce detectable prompt gamma-ray emission.
In Sec. 3, we showed that AT2020blt is on-axis and likely successfully launched a jet that broke out of the ejecta. Here, we explore if the jet was above the prompt emission threshold through back-of-the-envelope estimates and detailed fitting.
The threshold for producing prompt gamma-ray emission is typically assumed to be 0 100, with jets with Lorentz factors below this threshold referred to as `dirty' fireballs or failed gamma-ray bursts (Huang et al. 2002; Rhoads 2003). However, indirect measurements of the Lorentz factor as low as 0  20 have been made for jets following some successful gamma-ray bursts (e.g., Ghirlanda et al. 2018) with weak prompt emission. Accurately defining the gamma-ray prompt emission threshold requires knowing the radius at which prompt emission is produced, through what mechanism, and the fraction of photons above the pair production threshold in the co-moving frame. We do not know any of these constraints. However, all of these unknowns serve to lower the threshold 0 value for producing prompt gammaray emission. As such, we take the conservative value of 0  100 as the gamma-ray emission threshold, with 0  20 serving as the absolute lower limit.
We estimate the Lorentz factor by fitting the same power-law structured jet model described earlier with a finite deceleration radius allowing us to estimate the Lorentz factor. Our posterior on the Lorentz factor is 0 = 502+-229974. The probability of having the Lorentz factor lower than the prompt emission threshold (0 100) is 7% and 1% for 0 20. However, we note that because AT2020blt is missing early time data, our result is strongly dependent on the prior we assume for 0. For the analysis above, we place a uniform prior on 0 between 1 - 1000. To mitigate this dependency on the prior, we also estimate the Lorentz factor through back-of-the-envelope arguments.
The Lorentz factor can be estimated by measuring the afterglow onset time, also referred to as the deceleration timescale tdec. For an on-axis observer, the deceleration timescale is the peak of the optical lightcurve, with the relativistic jet starting to decelerate on this timescale. This allows us to place a lower limit on 0. The Lorentz factor is related to the deceleration timescale and weakly to the interstellar medium density and jet energy. We can approximate this relationship by (e.g., Sari & Piran 1999; Nakar 2007)

peak in AT2020blt but our analysis from Sec. 2 provides a conservative estimate of tpeak = 58876.10+-00..1232 MJD. With this estimate for tpeak we can use Eq. 5 and the derived values of Eiso and nism from Sec. 3 to set a lower limit on the Lorentz factor. We emphasise that the derived estimates of Eiso and nism are robust to the choice of the prior. This back of the envelope estimate suggests, conservatively 0 15, indicating that AT2020blt should have successfully produced prompt gamma-ray emission.
We note that if AT2020blt was a `dirty' fireball or failed gamma-ray burst, the threshold for producing gammarays would be higher. This is due to gamma-ray photons being produced when the jet is still optically thick and subsequently reabsorbed into the outflow, raising the kinetic energy of the outflow (e.g., Lamb & Kobayashi 2016). A scaling for this threshold is 0  16(Ek,50)0.15, which is weakly dependent on the efficiency in turning the gamma-ray energy into kinetic. For our estimated kinetic energy from Sec. 3, this implies 0  56 for producing gamma-ray emission, above our conservative estimate. However, our estimated Lorentz factor above is conservative and if AT2020blt is not a dirty fireball then this analysis does not hold. We therefore work with the observationally supported threshold where a jet with 0  20 produced a successful gamma-ray burst.
Our analysis indicates that AT2020blt is most likely not the afterglow from a `dirty' fireball and that the jet that broke out of the ejecta was likely above the threshold for producing prompt gamma-ray emission.
The lack of observed gamma-rays is therefore puzzling. As we show in Sec. 3, we observed AT2020blt on-axis, and therefore, relativistic beaming cannot explain the non-detection of prompt gamma-rays. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that AT2020blt can not be from a cocoon. Having ruled both these hypotheses out, we now turn to look at the prompt emission efficiency itself.

5. PROMPT EMISSION EFFICIENCY

Despite over three decades of observations, we still do not understand how prompt gamma-ray emission is produced. Given this uncertainty, we do not have a robust generative model to predict the energetics of the prompt gamma-ray emission. Given the lack of a model, a common approach in the field is to compare the energetics of the prompt and afterglow phases and compute a radiative efficiency n

n

(6)

where E,iso is the observed isotropic energy in gammarays. This efficiency has been calculated for a large catalogue of long and short gamma-ray bursts (Wang et al. 2015; Fong et al. 2015) using various techniques that have their own associated problems, most notably, fixing the energy in the magnetic-field b, rather than marginalising over the uncertainty in this parameter. The efficiencies have a broad distribution ranging from  1 to  90%. In principle, the radiative efficiency can offer a clue into the prompt emission mechanism. However, this is fraught with uncertainties due to detector selection effects, uncertain physics and modelling (e.g., LloydRonning & Zhang 2004; Zhang et al. 2007).

Sarin et al.

Ho et al. (2020) searched for sub-threshold triggers in Fermi (Meegan et al. 2009) and KONUS-Wind (Aptekar et al. 1995) finding no potential counterpart. Based on IPN observations, Ho et al. (2020) placed an upper limit on the gamma-ray energy of E 7 × 1052 erg by taking a nominal fluence threshold of 10-6 erg/cm2. Given our estimate for the kinetic energy through the afterglow fitting (see Sec. 3) this implies n 4.5%. However, this threshold is conservative. A search for coincident gamma-rays from KONUS-Wind has instead set a deeper upper limit on the fluence of 6.1 × 10-7 erg/cm2 (Ridnaia et al. 2020). With our estimate of the kinetic energy, this implies n 2.8% for gamma-rays not to be observed by KONUS-Wind or a gamma-ray energy E 1.2 × 1052 erg.
To augment this upper limit, we perform a subthreshold search of Fermi data (Goldstein et al. 2019). Unlike KONUS-Wind which did not have any interruptions to observations, Fermi observations were periodically interrupted due to occultation by Earth and Fermi passing through the South Atlantic Anomaly. However, the constraints Fermi provides are more sensitive, with an upper limit on E,iso from 1 - 6 × 1051 erg depending on the spectrum of the source and spectral template used in the search. Taking the lower value implies that for AT2020blt to not produce detectable prompt emission, the radiative efficiency must have been lower than 0.3%, challenging several prompt emission models such as photospheric emission (e.g., Lazzati et al. 2013) and magnetic field dissipation (e.g., Zhang & Yan 2011), but plausible for internal shock models (e.g., Kumar 1999).
In Fig. 4, we show these upper limits on the isotropic energy in gamma-rays for AT2020blt. The blue and black curves are the cumulative distribution of gammaray burst energies for AT2020blt calculated using the efficiencies derived from the Fong et al. (2015), and Wang et al. (2015) catalogues. We note that as Wang et al. (2015) fix b = 10-5, the efficiency derived in their sample are systematically biased to low values and serve as a lower limit on the observed population. The nondetection by KONUS-Wind and Fermi implies that if AT2020blt produced prompt emission, the isotropic energy released in gamma-rays must have been lower than  6 × 1051erg, an efficiency weaker than  99.8% of the observed distribution of gamma-ray bursts (Fong et al. 2015). In the gray shaded region, we show the predicted isotropic gamma-ray energy through the LiangGhirlanda relation, E  1052(0/182)4 (e.g., Liang et al. 2010; Ghirlanda et al. 2018). Here, we use our posterior, 0 = 502+-229974 obtained by fitting the afterglow (see Sec. 3). Given the non-detection by Fermi and KONUS-Wind , AT2020blt likely did not follow the Liang-Ghirlanda relation, which may suggest a different origin for this transient. However, it is worth noting that there are notable exceptions to the Liang-Ghirlanda relation, such as GRB090510 (Ghirlanda et al. 2010).
Our results suggest that if AT2020blt is a typical gamma-ray burst, given the afterglow modelling indicates that this event was on-axis, the prompt emission must have been low-luminosity to not be detected by Fermi and KONUS-Wind or missed by Fermi and weaker than 98.4% of the population. This low efficiency is not necessarily a problem for prompt emission

The black arrow indicates that the distribution derived in Wang et al. (2015) is likely a lower limit.

models (e.g., Kumar 1999) and might even support certain varieties of internal shock models. However, it is inconsistent with a large fraction of observed gammaray bursts (e.g., Wang et al. 2015; Fong et al. 2015). It is also plausible that AT2020blt is a failed gamma-ray burst, but to confirm this hypothesis, we need to accurately determine the threshold for generating gamma-ray emission. If the threshold is 0  20 (motivated by observations of successful gamma-ray bursts) then our most conservative analysis suggests AT2020blt is not a failed gamma-ray burst. However, if the threshold is higher, then there is some part of the parameter space where the jet launched in AT2020blt could fail to produce gammaray emission.
6. IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSION
Gamma-ray bursts have been observed extensively for over three decades, with their lower energy broadband afterglows almost always observed in the follow-up to a gamma-ray trigger. The Zwicky Transient Facility is quickly changing this dynamic, with three afterglow-like transients already detected without a gamma-ray trigger (Ho et al. 2020, 2021), with a further four independent detections of an optical counterpart to a gammaray burst. Here, we have investigated the observations of AT2020blt in detail to ultimately determine why no prompt gamma-ray emission was observed?
In Sec. 3, we showed that AT2020blt is best interpreted as the afterglow produced by a successful on-axis structured jet. We ruled out the hypotheses that AT2020blt was the afterglow of a cocoon or an off-axis gamma-ray

burst, with a cocoon and off-axis jet model unsuccessful in explaining the observations. In Sec. 4, we showed that the jet launched in AT2020blt was likely above the prompt emission generation threshold, i.e., the jet was relativistic enough to alleviate the compactness problem, potentially ruling out the hypothesis that AT2020blt was the afterglow of a dirty fireball. Moreover, given the rate of afterglow-like transients and gamma-ray bursts are roughly consistent, such phenomena can potentially already be ruled out (e.g., Cenko et al. 2015; Ho et al. 2020). In Sec. 5, we found that the non-detections of prompt gamma-ray emission in Fermi and KONUSWind imply that the prompt gamma-ray emission in AT2020blt was weaker than 99.8% of other gamma-ray bursts (e.g., Fong et al. 2015) or 98.4% if the gamma-ray burst occurred when only KONUS-Wind was observing.
The prompt emission we observed for GRB 170817A was likely produced through a different mechanism to other gamma-ray bursts, with cocoon-shock breakouts as one of the leading candidates (e.g., Gottlieb et al. 2018). However, given the large redshift of AT2020blt, a similar signature would have likely been undetectable (e.g., Nakar & Sari 2012). We also predicted the prompt emission energy through the Liang-Ghirlanda relation. If AT2020blt was consistent with this relation, the prompt emission should have been detected by both Fermi and KONUS-Wind , implying the gamma-ray energy generated in AT2020blt must be lower than the predictions by the Liang-Ghirlanda relation. However, we note that there are other gamma-ray burst exceptions to this relation, particularly GRB 090510 (Ghirlanda et al. 2010), which like AT2020blt, had weaker gamma-ray emission than expected.
Given our inadequate knowledge of prompt emission generation, the only meaningful study about the prompt emission we can do is investigate the prompt emission efficiency. Depending on the upper limits used, the radiative efficiency of AT2020blt is inconsistent with 98.4% of the population (Fong et al. 2015). This low-efficiency strongly favours internal shocks as the likely prompt emission generation mechanism (e.g., Kumar 1999).
In addition to AT2020blt, the Zwicky Transient Facility also detected AT2021any, another potential afterglow-like transient at z = 2.514 (Ho et al. 2021; Ho & Zwicky Transient Facility Collaboration 2021) which was observed to be rapidly fading after  22mins and detected without an identified gamma-ray counterpart despite coverage from multiple gamma-ray telescopes (Ho et al. 2021). Given that AT2021any was rapidly fading after  22mins, it was also likely observed on-axis and the non-detection of gamma-ray emission could imply it also has a low prompt emission efficiency that is inconsistent with the population. We note that the data for AT2021any is not yet available and therefore we can not perform the detailed analyses for AT2021any we presented here.
The radiative efficiencies of AT2020blt and AT2021any are potentially inconsistent with (or at least in the tails of) the observed population of gamma-ray bursts. The capabilities of the Zwicky Transient Facility, in particular, the high cadence and large survey volume (e.g., Bellm et al. 2019) provide an opportunity to detect afterglow transients without a gamma-ray counterpart. This implies that the detection of transients such as AT2020blt

7
and AT2021any are independent of gamma-ray observatories' observational biases. Therefore, it is conceivable that AT2020blt and AT2021any are the afterglows produced by the low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts that have so far been missed entirely (or less frequently observed) due to a Malmquist bias associated with gammaray observatories. Future all-sky gamma-ray detectors can avoid this bias and test whether these transients are genuinely part of the cosmological gamma-ray burst population or a distinct new class. Furthermore, new optical telescopes like the Vera Rubin observatory (e.g., Ivezi´c et al. 2019) will be capable of finding more transients like AT2020blt to deeper magnitudes and provide stringent constraints on various parameters to test the nature of these transients.
We also note that the inconsistency of the radiative efficiencies of AT2020blt and AT2021any with the observed population may be a product of inadequate modelling. Inferring prompt emission efficiencies requires robustly determining the kinetic energy in the afterglow, which requires a good understanding of the jet structure (at least for off-axis sources). Furthermore, in previous analyses, the estimations have often been done by fixing the energy fraction in the magnetic field, b, which significantly underestimates uncertainties at best or leads to biases at worst. This motivates the need for detailed afterglow modelling on individual gamma-ray bursts and entire populations with a detailed treatment of observational selection effects (e.g., Mandel et al. 2019).
It is also worth considering--albeit cautiously--whether AT2020blt and AT2021any are afterglows of typical gamma-ray burst progenitors at all. Instead, they may be the product of a different phenomenon or a subclass of typical gamma-ray burst progenitors that can launch a mildly relativistic, ultralow efficiency jet that interacts with the interstellar medium to produce an afterglow-like transient but does not necessarily produce prompt gamma-ray emission. If the Zwicky Transient Facility and later the Vera Rubin observatory continues to find afterglow-like transients without prompt emission, it would be intriguing to consider the host galaxy properties and the population properties of such transients. Although, as we discussed previously, it is more likely that AT2020blt and AT2021any are simply afterglows of gamma-ray bursts we previously missed due to observational biases. By virtue of opening a new window into these phenomena, it is likely that the Zwicky Transient Facility and in the future, Vera Rubin observatory will continue to find afterglow-like transients without high energy counterparts.
