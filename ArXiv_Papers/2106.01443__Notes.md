## Abstract

It is shown that the mixed states of a closed dynamics supports a reduplicated symmetry which is reduced back to the subgroup of the original symmetry group when the dynamics is open. The elementary components of the open dynamics are defined as operators of the Liouville space in the irreducible representations of the symmetry of the open system. These are tensor operators in the case of rotational symmetry. The case of translation symmetry is discussed in more details for harmonic systems.
