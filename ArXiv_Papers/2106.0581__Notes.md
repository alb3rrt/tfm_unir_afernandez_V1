## Abstract

The paper introduces and analyzes $N$-player and common-noise mean-field games in Itô-diffusion environments, in the context of both complete and incomplete financial markets. The players invest in a finite horizon and in a common market by either competitive or homophilous interactions. In both kinds of market environments, the players have individual risk tolerance coefficients. In the incomplete market setting, these risk tolerances are constants (CARA utilities), while in the complete market, they are assumed to be wealth-independent random variables depending, among others, on upcoming market information. For all these distinct models, we derive explicit or closed-form solutions for the optimal policies and optimal wealth processes, as well as for the related game values.
