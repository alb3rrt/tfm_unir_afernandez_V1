## Abstract

However, this evident and continued success renders it increasingly complex to live up to industrial expectations while enabling graduate students for state-of-the-art research in teaching MPC. Hence, this position paper attempts to trigger a discussion on teaching MPC. To lay the basis for a fruitful debate, we subsequently investigate the prospect of covering MPC in undergraduate courses; we comment on teaching textbooks; and we discuss the increasing complexity of research-oriented graduate teaching of~MPC.
