## Abstract

The variety $ \mathrm{Sing}_{n, m} $ consists of all tuples $ X = (X_1,\ldots, X_m) $ of $ n\times n $ matrices such that every linear combination of $ X_1,\ldots, X_m $ is singular. Equivalently, $X\in\mathrm{Sing}_{n,m}$ if and only if $\det(\lambda_1 X_1 + \ldots + \lambda_m X_m) = 0$ for all $ \lambda_1,\ldots, \lambda_m\in \mathbb Q $. Makam and Wigderson asked whether the ideal generated by these equations is always radical, that is, if any polynomial identity that is valid on $ \mathrm{Sing}_{n, m} $ lies in the ideal generated by the polynomials $\det(\lambda_1 X_1 + \ldots + \lambda_m X_m)$. We answer this question in the negative by determining the vanishing ideal of $ \mathrm{Sing}_{2, m} $ for all $ m\in \mathbb N $. Our results exhibit that there are additional equations arising from the tensor structure of $ X $. More generally, for any $ n $ and $ m\ge n^2 - n + 1 $, we prove there are equations vanishing on $ \mathrm{Sing}_{n, m} $ that are not in the ideal generated by polynomials of type $\det(\lambda_1 X_1 + \ldots + \lambda_m X_m)$. Our methods are based on classical results about Fano schemes, representation theory and Gröbner bases.
