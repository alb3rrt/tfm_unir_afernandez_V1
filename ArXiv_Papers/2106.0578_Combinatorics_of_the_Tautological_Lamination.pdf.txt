COMBINATORICS OF THE TAUTOLOGICAL LAMINATION
DANNY CALEGARI
Abstract. The Tautological Lamination arises in holomorphic dynamics as a combinatorial model for the geometry of 1-dimensional slices of the Shift Locus. In each degree q the tautological lamination defines an iterated sequence of partitions of 1 (one for each integer n) into numbers of the form 2mq-n. Denote by Nq(n, m) the number of times 2mq-n arises in the nth partition. We prove a recursion formula for Nq(n, 0), and a gap theorem: Nq(n, n) = 1 and Nq(n, m) = 0 for n/2 < m < n.

1. Introduction
The Tautological Lamination, introduced in [1], is a combinatorially defined object which gives a holomorphic model for certain 1 complex dimensional slices of the shift locus, a fundamental object in the theory of holomorphic dynamics. There is a shift locus Sq for each degree q; it is the space of normalized polynomials zq + a2zq-2 + a3zq-3 + · · · + aq in a complex variable z (thought of as a subset of Cq-1 with coordinates aj) for which every critical point is in the attracting basin of infinity.
There is a tautological lamination T (C) for each degree q and for each choice of critical data C (certain holomorphic parameters which determine the slice of Sq). Each tautological lamination determines a sequence of operations, called pinching, which cut the unit circle S1 up into pieces and reglue them into a collection of smaller circles, denoted S1 mod T,n(C). Subsequent operations refine the previous ones, so each component of S1 mod T,n(C) is cut up and reglued into a union of components of S1 mod T,n+1(C). The precise cut and paste operations depend on C, but the set of lengths of the components of T,n(C) (counted with multiplicity) depends only on n and the degree q. These lengths are all of the form

2mq-n for various non-negative integers m, and we can define Nq(n, m) to be the number of components of S1 mod T,n(C) of length 2mq-n.
The short components of S1 mod T,n(C) are those with length q-n. The number of short components is Nq(n, 0). Our first main result is an exact recursive formula for Nq(n, 0) (which can be solved in closed form):
Recursive Formula (Thm. 3.6). Nq(n, 0) satisfies the recursion Nq(0, 0) = 1, Nq(1, 0) = (q - 2) and
Nq(2n, 0) = qNq(2n - 1, 0) and Nq(2n + 1, 0) = qNq(2n, 0) - 2Nq(n, 0)
and has the generating function ((t) - 1)/qt where a closed form for (t) is given in Proposition 2.2.
At the other extreme, there is a unique largest component of S1 mod T,n(C) of length 2nq-n. Our second main result is a `gap' theorem:
Gap Theorem (Thm. 5.9). Nq(n, m) = 0 for n/2 < m < n.
Both the recursive formula for Nq(n, 0) and the existence of a gap were observed experimentally. Our main motivation in writing this paper was to give a rigorous proof of these observations.
One of the striking things about the tautological lamination is the existence of a rather mysterious bijection between the components of S1 mod T,n(C) and some seemingly unrelated objects called tree polynomials, introduced in § 4. This bijection is a corollary of one of the main theorems of [1], and the proof there is topological. We know of no direct combinatorial proof of this bijection, and raise the question of whether one can be found.

2. Unbordered words

Some words end like they begin, such as abra·cad·abra and b·aoba·b. Such words are said to be bordered. Others (most) are unbordered. A border is a nonempty, proper suffix of some word which is equal to a prefix.
If a word contains a border, then it contains one of at most half the length (for, a border of more than half the length will itself be bordered and now we can apply induction).
If W is a word, let's denote its length by |W |. If W is an unbordered word of even length, we can write it as W = W1W2 where |W1| = |W2|, and then for every letter c the word W1cW2 is also unbordered. If W is an unbordered word of odd length, we can write it as W = W1W2 where |W1| + 1 = |W2|, and then for every letter c the word W1cW2 is unbordered except when W1c = W2. Thus: if an denotes the number of unbordered words of length n in a q-letter alphabet, then a0 = 1 (there is one empty word) and

a2n+1 = qa2n and a2n = qa2n-1 - an

Let's define a generating function (t) :=

 n=0

an

tn

.

Then the recurrence

becomes the functional equation

(t)

=

- (t2) 1 - qt

Iteratively substituting t2 for t and being careful about convergence, one obtains the following formula:


(t) = 1 + q (-1)jt2j

j

1 (1 - q · t2i )

j=0

i=0

These facts are not new. Unbordered words have been studied by many authors.
They are also called bifix-free, and primary (neither of these terms seem very de-
scriptive to us). As far as we know they were first considered by Silberger [3]; see
also e.g. [2], p. 153.
A minor variation on this idea is as follows. Let's take for our q-letter alphabet the elements of Z/qZ. If W is a word in the alphabet, let W denote the result of adding 1 to the first letter (digit). Say a word is 1-unbordered if no suffix S is
equal to a prefix P or to P (and say it is 1-bordered otherwise). Then reasoning
as above gives:

Proposition 2.1 (Recursion). Let bn denote the number of 1-unbordered words of length n in a q-letter alphabet. Then b0 = 1 and

b2n+1 = qb2n and b2n = qb2n-1 - 2bn

Define the generating function (t) :=

 n-0

bntn.

Then

(t)

=

- 2(t2) 1 - qt

The following `closed form' for (t) (and the argument below) was kindly provided by Frank Calegari:

Proposition 2.2 (Closed form solution). The generating function (t) converges for small |t|, and can be analytically continued throughout the unit disk with a simple pole at every 2kth root of 1/q.
Define a sequence of integers h(n) by

h(0) := 1 and h(n) := (-q)s(n)(1 - (-2)k(n)) for n > 0

where 2k(n) is the biggest power of 2 dividing n, and s(n) is the sum of the binary digits of n. Then throughout the unit disk,

(t) =


h(n)tn
n=0

(1 - qt2j )
j=0

Proof. From the growth rate of the coefficients it's clear that (t) has a pole at

q-1 and converges uniformly throughout the open disk of radius q-1. It follows

that (t2) converges uniformly throughout the open disk of radius q-1/2. Using the

identity (1 - qt)(t) = 3 - 2(t2) and induction, the first claim is proved.

Let's define H(t) :=

 n=0

h(n)tn

and

B(t)

:=

H (t)

 j=0

(1

q

t2j

)-1

.

Then

the

proposition will follow if we can show that B(t) satisfies B(t)(1 - qt) = 3 - 2B(t2).

First observe that h(n) = 0 if n is odd; and furthermore,

2h(n) + h(2n) 3

=

(-q)s(n) 3

3 - 2(-2)k(n) + 2(-2)k(n)

= (-q)s(n)

The required identity is equivalent to





(1 - qt)B(t) (1 - qt2k ) = (3 - 2B(t2)) (1 - qt2k )

or





B(t) (1 - qt2k ) = (3 - 2B(t2)) (1 - q(t2)2k )

or



H(t) + 2H(t2) = 3 (1 - q(t2)2k )

Since h(n) = 0 for n odd this is equivalent to







h(2n)t2n + 2h(n)t2n = 3 (1 - q(t2)2k )

n=0

Replacing t2 by t and using h(2n) + 2h(n) = 3(-q)s(n) this is equivalent to





(-q)s(n)tn = (1 - qt2k )

which is clear.

The definition of 1-unbordered words would seem utterly unmotivated -- except that it just so happens that they arise naturally in an entirely different context which is the subject of the rest of the paper.

3. Tautological Laminations
3.1. Laminations. A leaf is an unordered pair of distinct points in a circle S. Two leaves in S are linked if they are disjoint (as subsets of S) and each separates the other in S. A lamination of S is a set of leaves in S, no two of which are linked. A finite lamination is one with finitely many leaves.
If  is a finite lamination of S we may pinch S along . This means that we quotient each leaf to a point, so that S collapses to a `tree' of smaller circles (sometimes called a cactus), and then split this tree apart into its constituent circles. We denote the result by S mod . See Figure 1.
If there is a Riemannian metric on S then we get a Riemannian metric on S mod , so it makes sense to talk about the length of the components of S mod , and observe that the sum of these lengths is equal to the length of S.

Now suppose  is the increasing union of n (for n = 1 to ) where each n is finite. The depth n leaves are those in n - n-1 and for each n we can form S mod n.
3.2. Tautological Laminations. We are interested in some naturally occurring laminations called Tautological Laminations. These objects were introduced in [1] to study the geometry and topology of the shift locus -- a certain parameter space that arises naturally in holomorphic dynamics. For example, in degree 2, the shift locus is the complement (in C) of the Mandelbrot set.
The Tautological Laminations in [1] have some extra structure -- they are actually `extended laminations' or elaminations; however, this extra structure is irrelevant to this paper and will be ignored; technically, the structures we discuss in this paper are merely the veins of the Tautological Laminations. We also do not give the most general definition.
Tautological Laminations are laminations of the unit circle, which we normalize as S1 = R/Z so that it has length 1. Fix a degree q which is an integer  2. Multiplication by q defines a degree q map from S1 to itself; if  is a leaf whose points do not differ by a multiple of 1/q then it makes sense to define the leaf q. Let C be a finite lamination C consisting of q - 2 leaves C1, · · · , Cq-2 such that for each j the points of Cj differ by 1/q. Thus we can write Cj = {j, j + 1/q} for some j  S1. For simplicity we assume that C is generic, meaning that the j are irrational and irrationally related.
The quotient S1 mod C is a union of q - 1 circles, q - 2 of them of length 1/q and one of length 2/q; we refer to this as the big circle and denote it B . The preimage of B in S1 is a finite collection of arcs of S1 bounded by points in leaves of C; denote this B. Note that the projection from B to B is 1­1 away from points in leaves of C.
We shall now define the depth n leaves of the tautological lamination T (C). Let x  B be a point for which qnx = j; this x will be a point of a depth n leaf of type j. Let z  B be the unique point for which the projections x , z  B are antipodal (i.e. they are distance 1/q apart). Define a finite lamination C(x) to be the union of C together with the leaf {x, z}.
Now, S1 mod C(x) is a union of q circles, all of length 1/q. Furthermore if we denote by  : S1  S1 mod C(x) the projection (which is well-defined away from the points of C(x)) the map z  q-1z extends from its domain of definition over the missing points to a homeomorphism from each component of S1 mod C(x) to S1. By abuse of notation, we denote this map by q : S1 mod C(x)  S1 and think of it as a q­1 map.
Lemma 3.1 (Division by q). If  := {a, b} is a generic leaf unlinked with C(x), and a  S1 satisfies qa = a then there is a unique b with qb = b so that  := {a , b } is unlinked with C(x).
Proof. `Generic' is just to rule out boundary cases where e.g. a or b is equal to a point in C(x). In particular, if a maps to a component Si of S1 mod C(x) then we can pull back  under the map q : Si  S1 and then take its preimage in S1 to obtain  .
Given x, we consider the sequence of points xi := qix for 0  i  n. By definition, xn = j. Define yn = j + 1/q and n := {xn, yn} so that n = Cj, and then inductively let i be obtained from i+1 as in Lemma 3.1 so that i := {xi, yi}

where qyi = yi+1 and i is unlinked from C(x). Finally we obtain the leaf 0 which, because it depends on x, we should really denote 0(x).
Definition 3.2. With notation as above, the depth n leaves of T (C) are the leaves q0(x) of S1 as x ranges over the points in B with qnx = j and j ranges over 1, · · · , q - 2.
Notice that in this definition every leaf is enumerated exactly twice; if x and z in B have antipodal image in B then the images of 0(x) and 0(z) are antipodal in B so that q0(x) = q0(z). So we only need to find a subset A  B projecting to half of B and add leaves q0(x) for x  A with qnx = j. Thus the number of leaves of depth n is equal to qn-1(q - 2). In particular T (C) is empty if q = 2.
Proposition 3.3 (Lamination). The leaves of T (C) are pairwise unlinked; thus T (C) really is a lamination. Furthermore, if T,n(C) denotes the leaves of T (C) of depth at most n, the set of lengths of components of S1 mod T,n(C) (counted with multiplicity) is independent of C and depends only on q.
For a proof, see [1], § 7. Tautological Laminations for q = 3, 4, 5, 6 (for a rather symmetric choice of C) are displayed in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Tautological Laminations for q = 3, 4, 5, 6.
Since the set of lengths of S1 mod T,n(C) (with multiplicity) is independent of C we can fix a normalization j = (j - 1)/q and suppress C in our notation in the sequel. This set of values is not generic; so we interpret the values of j as limits as we approach (j - 1)/q from below. So we should interpret Cj as a `leaf' whose endpoints span the interval [(j - 1)/q, j/q), for the purposes of determinining when leaves and their preimages are linked.
Then every depth n leaf is of the form q where  = {x, y} and qnx, qny = (j - 1)/q, j/q respectively. It follows that every depth n leaf of T consists of a pair of points which are integer multiples of q-n, and therefore every component of S1 mod T,n has length which is an integer multiple of q-n. What is not obvious, but is nevertheless true, is that these integer multiples are all powers of 2 (we shall deduce this in the sequel). Write the length of a component as · q-n where is a power of 2, and define Nq(n, m) to be the number of components of S1 mod T,n with = 2m.
Let's spell out Definition 3.2 in this normalization. We can take B and A to be the half-open intervals
B = [(q - 2)/q, 1) and A = [(q - 2)/q, (q - 1)/q)
The base q expansion of x  A with qnx = (j - 1)/q is a word of length n + 1 in the alphabet {0, 1, · · · , (q - 1)} starting with the digit (q - 2) and ending with the

COMBINATORICS OF THE TAUTOLOGICAL LAMINATION

digit (j - 1). If we denote the digits of x as x0 · · · xn then
x := ·(q - 2)x1x2 · · · xn-1(j - 1) and z := ·(q - 1)x1x2 · · · xn-1(j - 1)
Likewise, we denote the digits of y as y0 · · · yn. Then
(1) yn = j; and recursively, (2) if xi = q - 2 or q - 1 then yi = xi; and (3) if xi = q - 2 or q - 1 then yi is the unique one of q - 1 or q - 2 so that
·xi · · · xn and ·yi · · · yn do not link x and z.
Although we are not able to give a simple formula for Nq(n, m), it turns out there is a relatively simple formula for Nq(n, 0) -- i.e. the number of components of S1 mod T,n of length q-n. These are the short components.
3.3. Short Components. One of the nice things about our normalization C is that there is a simple relationship between short components of S1 mod T,n and certain depth n leaves of T,n, a relationship which is substantially more complicated for longer components. Say a short leaf is a depth n leaf of T,n whose points differ by exactly q-n (this is the least it can be). Then:
Lemma 3.4 (Short Leaf). There is a bijection between short components and short leaves of any fixed depth.
Proof. Let S be a short component at depth n, and consider the preimage X in S1. Then X is a union of finitely many disjoint arcs and isolated points bounded by leaves of depth  n. The total length of X is q-n by the definition of short component. But leaves of depth k consist of points which are integer multiples of q-k so the only possibility is that X consists of a single arc Y of S1 together with finitely many (possibly zero) isolated points joined to the endpoints of Y by a chain of leaves 0, · · · , n, each sharing one endpoint with the next.
We claim that in fact there are no isolated points, so that X = Y is a single arc of S1 cut off by a single (necessarily) short leaf. To see this, let's enlarge the circle by a factor of qn so that depth k leaves with k < n consist of points which are divisible by q, and each depth n leaf of type j joins a point congruent to (j - 1) mod q to a point congruent to j mod q. By the nature of their construction distinct depth n leaves of type j cannot share an endpoint, so a depth n leaf of type j must be followed by a depth n leaf of type j + 1, and only a type 1 leaf of depth n can follow a depth < n leaf and only in the positive (i.e. anticlockwise) direction around S1 (remember our understanding of j as the limit of a sequence approaching (j - 1)/q from below). It follows that if there is some intermediate point, the endpoints of Y differ by at least 2 mod q so that S is not short after all. This proves the claim.
Note that this Lemma is false for generic C. Let  be a short leaf of T of depth n of the form q0(x) where x  A and qnx = j. For this normalization, z = x + 1/q and y = x + q-1-n where 0(x) = {x, y}. The defining property of being a depth n leaf means that k(x) = qk0(x) does not link C(x) = C  {x, z} for any 0  k  n. Actually, for any integer m mod qn+1, setting x = mq-1-n and y = (m + 1)q-1-n, the leaf k(x) does not link any Ci for 0  i  (q - 2). So the short leaves are just the x for which k(x) does not link {x, z} for 0  k  n. Remember that the base q expansion of x is a word of length n+1 in the alphabet {0, 1, · · · , (q - 1)} starting with the digit (q - 2) and ending with the digit (j - 1).

The base q expansion of y is the same as that of x with the last digit replaced by j. Similarly, the base q expansion of z is the same as that of x with the first digit replaced by (q - 1). We deduce:
Lemma 3.5 (Short is 1-unbordered). A word in the alphabet {0, 1, · · · , (q - 1)} of length (n + 1) starting with (q - 2) and ending with (j - 1) corresponds to a short leaf if and only if it is 1-unbordered.
Proof. The leaf k(x) = {qkx, qky}, and the base q expansions of qkx and qky are obtained from the base q expansions of x and y by the k-fold left shift. This leaf links {x, z} if and only if the length k-suffix of x is either equal to a prefix of x, or to a prefix of z. But this is the definition of a 1-unbordered word.
Since (j - 1) is allowed to vary from 0 to (q - 3), and since a word that starts with (q - 2) and ends with (q - 2) or (q - 1) is already 1-bordered, it follows that Nq(n, 0) is equal to the number of 1-unbordered words of length (n + 1) starting with (q - 2), which is just q-1 times the number of 1-unbordered words of length (n + 1). In other words:
Theorem 3.6 (Recursive Formula). Nq(n, 0) satisfies the recursion Nq(0, 0) = 1, Nq(1, 0) = (q - 2) and
Nq(2n, 0) = qNq(2n - 1, 0) and Nq(2n + 1, 0) = qNq(2n, 0) - 2Nq(n, 0)
and has the generating function ((t) - 1)/qt where a closed form for (t) is given in Proposition 2.2.
4. Tree Polynomials
We now discuss a rather different class of objects that turn out to be naturally in bijection with the components of S1 mod T,n. These objects are called tree polynomials.
Definition 4.1. A tree polynomial is a finite rooted tree T together with the following data:
(1) depth: all leaves have a common depth n; we call this the depth of T ; (2) critical: all leaves are critical or ordinary;
(a) the root is critical; (b) every non-leaf critical vertex has exactly one critical child; (c) every ordinary vertex has no critical children; (3) order: the children of every vertex are ordered, and the critical child of the root is first among its siblings; (4) self-map: there is a simplicial self-map f : T  T such that (a) f (root) = root; (b) f (v) = root for all children v of the root; and (c) for all v with non-root parent w, the image f (v) is a child of f (w); (d) if v is ordinary and not a leaf, then f maps the children of v bijectively
and in an order-preserving way to the children of f (v); (e) if v is critical and not a leaf or the root, then f maps the children of
v in an order non-decreasing way to the children of f (v); this map is onto and 2­1 except for the critical child of v which is the unique child mapping to its image; (5) length: there is a length function from the vertices to N;

COMBINATORICS OF THE TAUTOLOGICAL LAMINATION

(a) (root) = 1; (b) if v is ordinary, (v) = (f (v)); (c) if v is critical, (v) = 2 (f (v)).
Another way of talking about the order structure on the children of each vertex is to say that T is a planar tree, and the map f is compatible with the planar structure.
4.1. Basic Properties.
Definition 4.2 (Degree). Let T be a tree polynomial. The root has one critical child with = 2 and some non-negative number of ordinary children with = 1. All children map to the root under f . Thus tree polynomials of depth 1 are classified by the number of children. The degree of a tree polynomial, denoted q(T ), is equal to the number of children of the root, plus one.
Example 4.3 (Degree 2). There is a unique tree polynomial of degree 2 of any positive depth, since every vertex is critical and all but the leaf have a unique child.
Definition 4.4 (Postcritical length). Let T be a tree polynomial and let c be the unique critical leaf. The postcritical length of T , denoted (T ), is equal to (f (c)) = (c)/2.
By induction, (T ) is always a power of 2. The next Proposition explains why we have introduced tree polynomials:
Proposition 4.5 (Bijection). There is a natural bijection between the set of degree q tree polynomials T of depth (n + 1) with (T ) = and the set of components of S1 mod n,T of length · q-n where n,T are the leaves of depth  n in the Tautological Lamination from § 3.
Proof. This is a corollary of Thms 9.20 and 9.21 in [1]. The tree polynomials are combinatorial abstractions of the sausage polynomials defined in [1] Def. 9.4. A sausage polynomial is a certain kind of infinite nodal genus 0 Riemann surface  together with a holomorphic self-map of degree q satisfying a number of properties. A tree polynomial records only the underlying combinatorics of , which is enough to recover .
It follows that for each n and each m, the number of degree q tree polynomials T of depth (n + 1) with (T ) = 2m is Nq(n, m).
Lemma 4.6 (Extension). Let T be a tree polynomial of depth n and let c be the unique critical leaf. Then tree polynomials T of depth (n + 1) that extend T are in bijection with the children of f (c).
Proof. To extend T to T we just add children to each of the leaves of T . For each ordinary leaf v we add a copy of the children of f (v). For the unique critical leaf c we must choose a child e of f (c) and then add as children of c one copy of e, and two copies of every other child of f (c). The copy of e becomes the unique critical child of c in T . The functions f and extend to these new leaves uniquely.
The next two lemmas give direct proofs in the language of tree polynomials of the identities Nq(n, m) · 2m = qn and Nq(n, m) = 1 + (q - 2)(qn - 1)/(q - 1). Both identities follow immediately from Proposition 4.5 since the first just says that the sum of the lengths of the components of S1 mod T,n is equal to 1, and the

10

DANNY CALEGARI

second just says that T has (q - 2)qn-1 leaves of depth n, both of which follow immediately from the definitions.
Lemma 4.7 (Multiplication by q). Let T have degree q. For each non leaf vertex v with children wi we have q · (v) = i (wi). Consequently Nq(n, m) · 2m = qn.
Proof. There is a unique tree polynomial of depth 1 and degree d. The root has (root) = 1, and it has q - 1 children with = 2, 1, · · · 1. Thus q · (v) = i (wi) is true for the root vertex, and by induction on depth, it is true for each ordinary or critical non leaf vertex.
For any T , the extensions T of T are in bijection with the children of the postcritical vertex, and the formula we just proved shows (T ) = q (T ).

Lemma 4.8 (Number of children). Let T have degree d. For each non leaf vertex v the number of children of v is (q - 2) (v) + 1. Consequently

Nq(n, m) = 1 + (q - 2)(qn - 1)/(q - 1)
m
Proof. First we prove the formula relating (v) to the number of children of v. The formula is true for the root vertex. If v is ordinary then (v) = (f (v)) and v has the same number of children as f (v), so if the formula is true for f (v) it is true for v. If v is critical then (v) = 2 (f (v)) and if f (v) has (q - 2) (f (v)) + 1 children then v has 2(q - 2) (f (v)) + 1 children. So the formula is true by induction.
Since there are Nq(n - 1, m) depth n degree q tree polynomials of length = 2m, and since by Lemma 4.8 each has (q - 2) (T ) + 1 children, we obtain a recursion

Nq(n, m) = Nq(n - 1, m)((q - 2)2m + 1) = (q - 2)qn-1 + Nq(n - 1, m)

m

m

m

Since m Nq(0, m) = 1 the lemma follows.

Lemma 4.9 (Length subdoubles). Every child w of v has (w)  2 (v) with equality iff every sibling of w has = 1.

Proof. By Lemma 4.7 and Lemma 4.8 w has (q - 2) (v) + 1 children, whose lengths sum to q (v).

5. F -sequences
Definition 5.1 (Critical Vein). Let T be a tree polynomial of depth n. The critical vein is the segment of T containing all the critical vertices. We denote it by  and label the critical points on  as ci where c0 is the root and cn is the critical leaf.
For each vertex w of T , define F (w) to be equal to f k(w) for the least positive k so that f k(w) is critical. Thus we can think of F as a map from the critical vein to itself, and by abuse of notation, for integers i, j we write F (i) = j if F (ci) = cj so that we can and do think of F as a function from {0, · · · , n} to itself. We also write (i) for (ci).
Lemma 5.2 (Properties of F ). F (0) = 0 and for every positive i, F (i) < i and F (i + 1)  F (i) + 1. Furthermore, (i) = 2 (F (i)) for i > 0 so that (i) = 2k where k is the least integer so that F k(i) = 0

Proof. Since f (w) has smaller depth than w unless w is the root, F (i) < i. Furthermore, F (ci+1) is equal to F (w) for some child w of F (ci), so F (i + 1)  F (i) + 1.
Finally, (w) = (f (w)) when w is ordinary or the root, and (w) = 2 (f (w)) when w is critical and not the root.
Let + denote the union of  together with the siblings of every critical vertex. We may think of it as a digraph (i.e. a directed graph), where every edge points away from the root. Define  to be the quotient of + obtained by identifying every sibling w of a critical vertex with its image F (w). Note that  is a digraph.
The next proposition gives a characterization of the functions F that can arise from tree polynomials.
Proposition 5.3 (F -sequence). A function F from {0, 1, · · · , n} to itself arises from some tree polynomial T of depth n if and only if it satisfies the following properties:
(1) F (0) = 0 and F (1) = 0; (2) each j has a finite set of options which are the admissible values of F (i + 1)
when F (i) = j; (a) the options of 0 are 0 and 1; (b) if F (i) = 0 then the options of i are i + 1 and whichever option of 0 is
not equal to F (i + 1); (c) if F (i) = 0 and F (i + 1) is not equal to F (i) + 1 then the options of i
are i + 1 together with the options of F (i); (d) if F (i) = 0 and F (i + 1) = F (i) + 1 then the options of i are i + 1
together with all the options of F (i) except F (i) + 1.
A function F is an F -sequence if it satisfies these properties.
Proof. Imagine growing a tree T by iterated extensions from a tree of depth 1. The extensions at each stage are the children of the critical image f (v), which in turn may be identified with the children of F (v).
When we grow T of depth i to T we grow  to  by adding a new edge from i to a new vertex i + 1, and adding two new edges from i to j for each edge from F (i) to j except for the edge from F (i) to F (i + 1) (outgoing edges at F (i) may be identified with the options of F (i) as above). The root 0 is joined by a single edge both to itself and to 1, but every other vertex i is joined by a single edge to i + 1 and by an even number of edges to each of its options (this can be seen by induction). The proposition follows.
The map from tree polynomials to F -sequences is many to one, since for every vertex i of  except the root, if there is an edge from i to j = i + 1 then there are at least two such edges. Nevertheless, if F is an F -sequence corresponding to T of depth n, the extended sequence defined by F (n + 1) = F (n) + 1 corresponds to the unique extension of T for which F (cn+1) is the critical child of F (cn).
Example 5.4. (T ) = 1 if and only if F (n) = 0 where n is the depth of the tree. The number of depth n tree polynomials with this property is Nq(n - 1, 0) by definition.
Example 5.5. There is a unique depth n tree polynomial T of any degree with 2 (T ) = (n) = 2n namely the tree polynomial for which F (i) = i - 1 for all positive i. Thus Nq(n, n) = 1. We call these trees of maximal type.
The components of S1 mod T,n corresponding to the trees of maximal type are clearly evident in Figure 2.

For each positive k let ik denote the least index (if any) for which (ik) = 2k. Note that i0 = 0.
Lemma 5.6 (Increments Grow). F (ik) = ik-1 for k > 0. Consequently |ik+1 - ik|  |ik - ik-1|.
Proof. By definition F (ik) is some value of j with (j) = 2k-1. But if j > ik-1 there was some i < ik with F (i ) = ik-1, contrary to the definition of ik.
The inequality follows from F (i + 1)  F (i) + 1.
Definition 5.7 (S and B). Let F be an F -sequence. Let S be the set of indices i such that F (i + 1) = F (i) + 1 and let B be the rest. Note that 0 is in B.
The prior options of i are the options other than i + 1. We denote these by P (i). Thus, if i  S then P (i) = P (F (i)).
Lemma 5.8 (Backslide). Let F be an F -sequence and let i  B. Then F (i + 1) < F (i) and F (i + 1)  P (b) where b = F k(i) for some k and b  B.
Proof. Since i  B we must have F (i + 1)  P (F (i)) so that necessarily F (i + 1) < F (i). Furthermore, if F (i)  S, then P (F (i)) = P (F 2(i)) and so on by induction until the first k so that F k(i)  B.
Using F -sequences we may deduce the following `gap' theorem, that was observed experimentally.
Theorem 5.9 (Gap). Nq(n, m) = 0 for n/2 < m < n.
Proof. Let T be a tree polynomial of depth n + 1. If m < n then T is not of maximal type, so there is some first positive index k  B. Note that ik = k and in fact ij = j for all j  k. Since k  B, by Lemma 5.8, F (k + 1)  P (b) where b  B is < k. But then b = 0 so F (k + 1) = 0. It follows that ik+1  2k + 1 and, successively, ik+j  k + j(k + 1). From this the desired inequality follows.

6. Tautological Tree
Degree q tree polynomials of various depth can themselves be identified with the vertices of a (rooted, planar) tautological tree Tq, whose vertices at depth n are the tree polynomials of degree q and depth n, and for each vertex T of Tq, the children of T are the extensions of T .
Note that for each vertex T of Tq we can recover (T ) from the number of children of T in Tq, since this number is (q - 2) (T ) + 1. So all the data of Nq(n, m) can be read off from the abstract underlying tree of Tq (in fact, even the root can be recovered from the fact that it is the unique vertex of valence q - 1).
The tree T3 up to depth 4 (with vertices labeled by value, from which one could easily extend it another row as an unlabeled tree) is depicted in Figure 3:
Every vertex labeled 1 has two children labeled 2 and 1. Every vertex labeled
2 has three children, but these might be labeled 4, 1, 1 or 2, 2, 2. Components of
the complement of the shift locus Sq in a 1-dimensional slice are in bijection with the ends of Tq. Each such end gives rise to a sequence (n) of -values, and when
1/ (n) diverges, the corresponding component consists of a single point. Such
ends are called small; those with 1/ (n) <  are big. Big ends are dense in the space of ends of Tq:

6. Tautological Tree

Degree q tree polynomials of various depth can themselves be identified with the

vertices of a (rooted, planar) tautological tree Tq, whose vertices at depth n are the

tree polynomials of degree q and depth n, and for each vertex T of Tq, the children

of T are the extensions of T .

Note that for each vertex T of Tq we can recover `(T ) from the number of children

of T in Tq, since this number is (q 2)`(T ) + 1. So all the data of Nq(n, m) can

be read o from the abstract underlying tree of Tq (in fact, even the root can be

recovered from the fact that it is the unique vertex of valence q 1).

Proposition 6.1 (Big ends dense). Big ends are dense. In other words, every finite rooted path in Tq can be extended to an infinite path converging to a big end.
Proof. Let T be a tree polynomial of some finite depth n and let F be the associated F -sequence. Suppose F (n) = i. There is a unique infinite sequence of extensions of T defined recursively by F (m+1) = F (m)+1 for all m  n. Then F (m) = m+i-n for all sufficiently large m, so that (m) = 2 (m + i - n) and 1/ (m) < .

Let's call an end type S if the associated F -sequence satisfies F (m+1) = F (m)+1 for all sufficiently large m (i.e. if it is of the sort constructed in Proposition 6.1).
We end this section with two conjectures:

Conjecture 6.2 (Big components big ends). A component of the complement of Sq in a slice has positive diameter if and only if it corresponds to a big end of Tq.
Conjecture 6.3 (Big ends eventually periodic). Every big end is of type S.
