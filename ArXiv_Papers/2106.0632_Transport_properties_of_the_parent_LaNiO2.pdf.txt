Here we study the transport properties of a nickelate compound, namely LaNiO2 using density functional theory (DFT) in conjunction with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). An interacting multi-orbital spin-resolved scenario for LaNiO2 yields a metallic ground state with ferromagnetic correlations. The latter contrasts an antiferromagnetic order reported earlier. The metallic behaviour persists even at large values of the interaction energies. Further support of the metallic state is provided by the angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data.

I. INTRODUCTION
Transport properties of strongly correlated compounds may yield many surprising features, such as non-Fermi liquid behaviour, strong magnetic correlations, the emergence of superconductivity, etc. The nickelates, namely, RNiO2 (R = La, Nd) owing to their prospects of being compared (and contrasted) with the cuprates have started receiving significant attention in recent times. The realization of a superconducting phase in Sr doped NdNiO2 with a transition temperature in the range 9 K - 15 K [1] rendered support to closer scrutiny on the similarity with the cuprates.
The rationale behind drawing a parallel between the nickelates and the cuprates is in the fact that Ni shares a close proximity of Cu in the periodic table. In fact, the infinite layer RNiO2 is isostructural to CaCuO2 [2], where the latter represents the parent compound of a high -Tc superconductor. However, the parent compounds of nickelates are reported to be metallic with no magnetic order [1, 3, 4]. The absence of magnetic order is attributed to the 3d bands of Ni getting self-populated by holes from the 5d electrons of R resulting in no magnetic order. Indeed, in this sense, the nickelates are quite different than the cuprates. However, the hybridization between the dx2-y2 orbitals of Ni and those of the rare earths (R) could be quite weak and the self-doping effects may not be dominant.
Valence counting of Ni1+ cations with a 3d9 configuration is formally similar to Cu2+ in the cuprates. The band structure predominantly consists of 3dx2-y2 orbitals of Ni (similar to Cu d-orbitals) and 5d3z2-r2 orbitals from La with the contribution coming from the oxygen porbitals to be significantly less than that in the cuprates. In the scenario presented by this, the hopping within the d-orbitals of Ni is negligible, and so are the inter-cell hopping amplitudes severely suppressed. In view of this we have only retained the inter-orbital Coulomb repulsion between the 3d bands of Ni with those of 5d of La.
Before one understands the effects of doping, a few things need to be settled for the parent compound itself. With a view to accomplish that, we investigate the band structure and the transport properties of LaNiO2 via DFT plus DMFT technique. While we agree on a metal-

lic ground state and absence of any insulating behaviour (unlike cuprates) even at significantly large electronic correlations, our results on the magnetic behaviour disagrees with those in Ref. [5]. We distinctly get ferromagnetic correlations due to the Ni atoms via magnetization studies where the magnetic moments of the order of  0.28 µB in the limit of vanishing field. This result severely contradicts the corresponding scenario in cuprates which has an antiferromagnetic insulating ground state for the undoped compound. This certainly holds a promise that the dopant induced superconducting state may yield new physics embedded therein. Further, a test of the familiar Fermi liquid (FL) theory in the context of the metallic ground state is probed by the peak in the single-particle Green's function that can be verified by angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments.
Our paper is organized as follows. We present the DFT band structure along with the crystal structure of nickelate LaNiO2. The density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level is presented to confirm the existence of the metallic behaviour which are further supported by a T 2 resistivity that are demonstrated by the experiments [3, 6]. As a test of the ferromagnetic correlations we present the magnetization data as a function of the applied magnetic field and finally the presence of the quasiparticle peaks provide support to the presence of the FL state.
II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS
In this work, we have carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations within Perdew-BurkeErnzherof (PBE) parameterization of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [7] as implemented in Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [8] to obtain the band structure and the density of states (DOS) of LaNiO2. Further, we use first-principles DFT combined with dynamical mean field theory to obtain the correlation effects of LaNiO2. For the calculation, the lattice parameters used for LaNiO2 were a = b = 4.002 °A, c = 3.339 °A, and the crystal structure was of the space group 123 (P 4/mmm). The parameter, Rmtkmax (Rmtkmax stands for the product of the smallest atomic sphere radius Rmt times the largest k-vector kmax) is chosen to

be 7.5, and 10 × 10 × 10 k-mesh is employed for the structural optimization. Furthermore, the kinetic energy cutoff is set to 500 eV. Finally, the self consistent field (scf) calculations are performed till an energy accuracy of 10-4 eV is achieved.
With the DOS from VASP as the input, we employ DMFT via the multi-orbital iterative perturbation theory (IPT) package. We assume the total Hamiltonian to be of the form,

where k,a is the band dispersion, a and  denote the

band and spin indices. U1 and U2 are the intra- and interorbital Coulomb interaction terms between the electrons with opposite spins at the same site and between electrons with same spins in different sites respectively. JH is the Hund's coupling. Both being d-orbitals, we have chosen the same value of U1 corresponding to the La d and Ni d orbitals. Further, we use the Kanamori relation among the different energy scales, namely

U2 = U1 - 2JH .

(2)

We have considered JH = 0.7 eV, a realistic value for manganites and should work for nickelates as well and varied U1 and U2 over a reasonable range. In keeping with the values of the interaction parameters used in the recent studies [9, 10], the results corresponding to U1 = 4.0 eV and U2 = 2.6 eV are presented in our paper. These values were used for the resistivity and the magnetization data, while the spin-polarized DOS includes other values as well. We, however have performed calculation with much larger values of U1 and U2, for example U1 = 10 eV and corresponding U2 defined in Eq. (2). However our results are qualitatively unaltered at very large interaction energies.
Finally the total Hamiltonian is solved within the multi-orbital iterative perturbation theory (MOIPT) plus DMFT [12­17]. IPT is already an established technique for the repulsive Hubbard model in the paramagnetic phase. The IPT technique is constructed in such a way that it should successfully reproduce the leading order terms of the self energy in all of the different cases, such as, weak coupling limit, atomic limit, large frequency limit and it must be exact in the low frequency limit. In the IPT approximation, we approximate the self energy by its second order contribution, namely,

()  U n + ~ (02)()

(3)

here ~ (02)() is the second order contribution arising due to the perturbation term, Hint (see Eq. 1) and n is the particle number. Though it is an approximate method,
it gives good qualitative agreement compared to more
exact methods to solve an interacting Hamiltonian.
The parameters, namely, the Coulomb interaction, U1 and the Hund's coupling, JH are varied within an experimentally realizable range to obtain the DOS in presence
of electron correlation. Also  (= 1/kBT ) is the inverse temperature. T is varied up to 300 K to get the temper-
ature dependent behaviour of the resistivity. The DFT
plus DMFT self energy calculations are converged up to a precision of 10-4 in energy units.

the spin-polarized DFT band structure of the given material. The blue and the red lines denote the - and the -spin bands respectively. We see from our DFT calculation that near the Fermi energy only Ni 3d (3dx2-y2 ) and La 5d (5d3z2-r2 ) bands are present. The 2p bands of oxygen are well separated from them, which is in high contrast with its cuprate counterpart CaCuO2 [5]. Now, from the non-interacting density of states obtained from the DFT calculations, we concentrate only on the four bands among all the atomic bands of LaNiO2 that cross the Fermi level. These four bands are La (5d ), La (5d ), Ni (3d ), and Ni (3d ) bands.
The DOS is given by

In Fig. 2, we show the orbital-resolved spin-polarized density of states for the La 5d (Fig. 2(a)) and Ni 3d (Fig. 2(b)) atoms computed for various intra- and interband interaction energies U1 and U2. The results of the LDA+U calculations on nickelates reported by Anisimov et al. [18] indicated it to be a stable antiferromagnetic

insulator. However, the insulating nature of the ground state was contrasted by other groups [5, 19] we too get a metallic behaviour. Though strong electronic correlations renormalize the DOS, the effects are not well visible at the scale presented here. From Fig. 2, it is observed that the spectral weight at the Fermi level, EF reduces with increasing U 's for all the four bands under consideration.
The correlated electronic spectra from the DMFT demonstrates that LaNiO2 is a strongly correlated metal. The metallic behaviour for both the La and the Ni atoms with - and -spins were confirmed by vanishing of the imaginary part of the self-energy (Im()) in the vicinity of the Fermi level (EF ). The imaginary part being zero implies the absence of a gap opening at the Fermi level, which, in our case remains robust up to moderate to high values of the interaction potential (U1 and U2). To avoid repetition, we only plot Im() corresponding to -spins for both La and Ni in Fig. 3. The data for -spins do not yield anything qualitatively distinct. We have checked that the spectral weight continues to be zero at EF . This confirms the correlated metallic behaviour of LaNiO2, which is in good agreement with the previ-

ously reported results for nickelates [3, 5, 19, 20]. Even

at much larger values of U1 (and U2), the system retains its metallic character. Even till as high as U1 = 10 eV, there is no trace of any insulating behaviour that emerges

from our calculation.

To further support of the metallic state, we plot the

0( ) is the non-interacting DOS and the spectral function is obtained via Eq. 4. For the strongly correlated materials dc resistivity can be calculated using the relation of . The parameters used in our calculation are U1 = 4.0 eV and U2 = 2.6 eV and we have the resistivity behaviour from a very low temperature all the way up to the room temperature. We have found that the total resistivity arising out of the contributions from both the bands (- and -spin bands) follow a T 2 behaviour. Since both the bands overlap with each other, we have only represented the resistivity data for -spin only. Here the resistivity is normalized with respect to its maximum value. This type of metallic nature of LaNiO2 is consistent with the previously reported data on LaNiO2 [3, 6]. It is further worthwhile to mention that the dc resistivity data presented in Fig. 4, although comprises of the total contribution from both the La and the Ni bands, the contribution from Ni, that is from the 3d band of Ni is the most dominant one.

In a recent study of the orbital-resolved spin susceptibility for NdNiO2 [21], the importance of the inter-orbital contribution was highlighted. The authors have found that the relative contributions to the susceptibility from the axial s-orbital of Ni to that from its d-orbital to be only 10%, while the same for the inter-orbital (s - d) contribution to the d-orbital is 20%. In comparison, the same for LaNiO2 only 1% and 5% respectively. This confirms the total susceptibility in LaNiO2 is almost dominated by the d-orbital contribution [21].
Next we present the magnetization plot of LaNiO2, where the spin- and the spin- states are partially filled with an occupation difference between them, thereby resulting in a net magnetic moment. Again the magnetization is predominantly contributed by the Ni 3d orbitals. The magnetization is defined as

m = ni - ni

(6)

where ni are calculated by integrating the spin-resolved DOS. The magnetic moment of Ni is about 0.2831 µB, and La atom has a much smaller value, namely 0.00146 µB and the latter also aligns anti-parallel with the moments from the Ni atoms. We have considered the total magnetization that is the magnetization from both the Ni and the La bands.
The system turns out to be ferromagnetic with a value for the magnetic moment to be 0.282 µB. Fig. 5 shows the magnetization, m vs the applied magnetic field, H curve. From the plot, it is clear that m shows a linear behaviour with H in the range shown in Fig. 5. This result is in contrast with the previously reported result of Ref. [5]. Where for RNiO2 (R = Nd, La) they have found a stable C-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state with magnetic moments inside the Ni spheres having an approximate value of 0.7 µB. However, they have reported a ferromagnetic state which gives rise to

The reason behind the discrepancy arises because they have considered a non-interacting ground state, whereas we have considered strong electronic correlations. Also the linear dependence of the magnetization as a function of the external field for undoped LaNiO2 shows widely different behaviour from the corresponding data for cuprates which show insulating long-range antiferromagnetic order in their undoped ground state.
Finally the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) spectra can be considered as a helpful technique to support our results for the metallic ground state of LaNiO2. Detailed ARPES studies on LaNiO2 are not available in literature. The ARPES spectral intensity I(k, ) is given by, I(k, ) = I0(k)A(k, )f () where A(k, ) represents the spectral function, I0(k) incorporates the dipole matrix elements, and f () is the Fermi distribution function. In the case corresponding to a mo-

where k is the noninteracting dispersion. Im() and Re() represent the imaginary and real parts of the self energy respectively. Fig. 6 illustrates the photoemission intensity energy distribution curves (EDC) along -X - M -  direction for the Ni - and -spin bands at a temperature T = 50 K. Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 6(b) show the DMFT single particle spectral function at T = 50 K for the Ni - and the Ni -spin bands respectively. The presence of sharp quasiparticle peaks in the ARPES intensity confirm the Fermi liquid nature of the parent compound LaNiO2.
We would like to make several remarks here. From our DFT plus DMFT calculations, we show that the normal state of the parent LaNiO2 is quite different from its copper oxide counterpart. The ground state of LaNiO2 is in a strongly correlated metallic state, which agreed and also have conflicts with some previously reported data. We have also identified the Ni-3d (3dx2-y2 ) orbital as the most correlated one. The metallic nature was confirmed by the Im() data and also LaNiO2 shows a T 2 behaviour in the resistivity vs temperature plot. Further, LaNiO2 follows a linear dependence of magnetization, that is a ferromagnetic behaviour upon applying an external magnetic field. The magnetic ordering of the parent nickelate LaNiO2 is quite different from the magnetic ordering of cuprates. In addition, in support of our Fermi liquid ground state, we also provide the ARPES data. The sharp quasiparticle peaks in ARPES intensity confirm the presence of a FL ground state.
