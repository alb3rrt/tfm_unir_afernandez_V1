## Abstract

Under this assumption, we obtain the optimal Berry-Esséen bounds when $H\in (0,\,\frac23]$ and the upper Berry-Esséen bounds when $H\in (\frac23,\,\frac34]$. As a by-product, we also show the almost sure central limit theorem (ASCLT) for the quadratic variation when $H\in (0,\,\frac34]$. The results extend that of \cite{NP 09} to the case of general Gaussian processes, unify and improve the Berry-Esséen bounds in \cite{Tu 11}, \cite{AE 12} and \cite{KL 21} for respectively the sub-fractional Brownian motion, the bi-fractional Brownian motion and the sub-bifractional Brownian motion.
