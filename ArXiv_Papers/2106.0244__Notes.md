## Abstract

We consider the overlap of Bethe vectors of the XXX spin chain with a diagonal twist and the modified Bethe vectors with a general twist. We find a determinant representation for this overlap under one additional condition on the twist parameters. Such objects arise in the calculations of nonequilibrium physics.
