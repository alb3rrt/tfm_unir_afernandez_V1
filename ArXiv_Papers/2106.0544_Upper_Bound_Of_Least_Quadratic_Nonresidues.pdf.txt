1 Introduction

Let p  2 be a prime, and let np  2 denotes the least quadratic nonresidue modulo p. The Burgess upper bound of the least quadratic nonresidue claims that

np



c0

,

(1)

where c0 > 0, is a constant, and  > 0 is a small number, see [1], and [3] for a survey and discussion. This note improves this result to the following.

Theorem 1.1 (Main). Let p be a prime, let np denotes the least quadratic nonresidue modulo p. If  > 0 is a small number, and  = 1 is the quadratic character modulo p, then

np

where c > 0 is a constant.

The numerical values of the exponents of the upper bounds (1) and (2) are

Thus, for sufficiently large prime p, and very small  > 0, this improvement amounts to a

power saving by a factor of

2 Prime Indicator Functions

The standard weighted prime indicator function is the vonMangoldt function  : N - R

defined by

(n) = log p 0

if n = pk is a prime power, if n = pk is not a prime power,

where k  1. A pair of different, both nonweighted and weighted, representations of the prime indicator functions are introduced below.

Lemma 2.1. Let N be a large prime, and let x  1 be a real number. The indicator function of prime integer n  x is given by

(n) 0

if n = q; if n = q;

Normalization of the prime N . To estimate the size of the prime N with respect to the asymptotic formula for the prime harmonic sum qx 1/q, the asymptotic formula is computed in two distinct ways.

The standard asymptotic formula for the prime harmonic sum is (Mertens theorem),

where where q ranges over the primes, and M > 0 is a constant. In contrast, the new evaluation, using Lemma 2.1, is

A comparison of the main term of (5) and the main term of (6) provides the correct normalization for the prime N  2 respect to (5). Namely,

There is no requirement to select a prime value N , but the analysis is simpler than composite value N .

3 Characters Sums Over Short Intervals

Given a large prime p  2, a short interval [1, x] is defined as having a small x < p1/2+.
The basic character sum nx (n) is well studied. There are many versions and improvements, both implicit and explicit, in the literature, see [3], [8], et alii. However, the
basic results are all similar to the oldest version.

Theorem 3.1. ([2]) Let p  2 be a large prime, and let x  p be a real number. If  = 1 is a nonprincipal character p, then

Theorem 3.2. Let p  2 be a large prime, and let x  p1/4+, with  > 0. If  = 1 is the quadratic symbol modulo p, then

(n)  x1-,

5 Equivalent Character Sums
An equivalent exponential sum expresses the original exponential sum independent of certain parameter, in this case b = 0. This technique allows a product of two interfused exponential sums to be expressed as a product of two independent exponential sums.

7 Characters Sums Over The Primes

The class of character sums nx (n)(n) for nonprincipal characters  modulo p = o(x) has a vast literature, see [5, Chapter 19], and similar references. However, the literature
for the class of character sums with  modulo p  x is scarce. A technique for handling
character sums over the primes without any restriction on the character  modulo p  2
is introduced here.

Lemma 7.1. Let p be a large prime, let  be a characters modulo p, and let x  p and x  z  x be real numbers, with  > 0. Then,

A recent proof appears in [8, Theorem 2.4], and the earliest proof in [10]. The generalization to arbitrary characters  = 1 modulo p, and different approaches to the proofs are also available in the literature.

A quadratic improvement of the parameter from z = x1/e to z = x1/e is considered in the next result.

Theorem 9.2. Let p  2 be a large prime, and let x < p be a real number. If  = 1 is the quadratic symbol modulo p, and

then there is an integer n  x1/e for which (n) = -1.

10 Upper Bound of Quadratic Nonresidues

Proof. (Theorem 1.1). Given a small number  > 0, and a large prime p  2, let x = p1/4+, and let z = x1/e. By Theorem 3.2,

11 Applications
This result has many applications in computational number theory, [4, Section 2.3.2], and other topics in pure mathematics, see [9, Section 1.3]. For example, it improves the deterministic square root modulo a large prime p calculation by a factor of p.059663, see (3).
