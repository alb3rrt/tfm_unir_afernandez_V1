Abstract. The characterization of the gravitational field of isolated objects is still an open
question in quadratic theories of gravity. We study static equilibrium solutions for a selfgravitating fluid in extensions of General Relativity including terms quadratic in the Weyl tensor and in the Ricci scalar. We parametrize the external field in terms of the total mass and the strength of two Yukawa corrections associated with the quadratic terms in the action. Depending on the value of the mass-ratio of the two massive propagating degrees of freedom, these corrections are completely determined by the mass and the radius of the star. At variance with classical General Relativity, measurable definitions of the mass-energy of a star are not uniquely determined by its ADM mass, on the contrary distinct quasi-local definitions should be used to properly characterize the external field. We suggest that this apparent ambiguity can conveniently be exploited to detect deviations from standard General Relativity.

1 Introduction

Quadratic theories of gravity naturally emerge as alternative candidates to Einstein's theory at the quantum level. In d = 4 dimensions they are defined by the following action

S=

d4

x

 -g

 R -  CµCµ +  R2 + Lmat

(1.1)

where Cµ is the Weyl tensor and Lmat is the matter lagrangian. The dynamical content of the theory consists in a spin-two massless Einstein mode and additional massive spin-two and spin-zero modes of masses m22 = /2 and m20 = /6 respectively. The theory turns out to be renormalisable [1] but the spin-two massive mode is a ghost excitation which can potentially spoil the unitarity of the Lorentzian theory. The energy scale of this phenomenon is not known and various proposals on possible resolutions of this issue have recently appeared [2­5]. According to Ostrogradsky's theory the presence of these states corresponds to an instability at the classical level. For this reason it is important to study the classical content of the theory and in particular the properties of the solutions in vacuum and in the presence of matter.
In spherical symmetry the weak field limit of asymptotically flat solutions of (1.1) is well understood at theoretical [6] and phenomenological [7, 8] level. At large r the space-time is in fact completely determined by the 1/r newtonian potential generated by the exchange of the spin-two massless mode and a combination of Yukawa corrections of the type e-mr/r where m = m2 or m = m0 for the spin-two and spin-zero massive modes. In the limit of strong field regime the non-linearity of the field equations renders the study of the spectrum of the possible solutions much more difficult. The recent discovery of a class of non-Schwarzschild

­1­

black holes [9, 10] has triggered new works in this direction. Combinations of analytical [11­13] and numerical approaches [14­16] have studied these new black holes in detail, and in [15] the first complete analysis of the link between the weak field expansion, the structure of the horizons and the interior has been presented for static space-times. Solutions with regular metric coefficients and no horizons as well as wormholes type solutions have also been discovered [10, 17]. All this complex taxonomy has to be contrasted with the situation in classical GR where the external field of an asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric space-time is instead uniquely determined by the Schwarzshild metric.
At the same time the success of the Starobinsky model of inflation [18, 19] has brought the attention of the astrophysical community on the R + R2 theory of gravity, and neutron stars in such theory have been studied in great detail in the last years [20­27], albeit the inclusion of more complex quadratic curvature terms have been relatively poorly studied [24, 28, 29]. Both perturbative and non perturbative methods have been used, together with a large number of different equations of state, nevertheless the behaviour of the external gravitational field of neutron stars in quadratic theories of gravity is still not fully clarified.
In this work we would like to bring together these two different lines of research, and link the explicit Yukawa corrections to the Newtonian potential of [6] to a perfect fluid stress-energy tensor, by means of the numerical methods already implemented in [15]. The conceptual difficulty one immediately faces in this case is that the standard boundary condition at the stellar surface does not uniquely characterize the external field, as already noticed by [27] for the R + R2 theory. As we shall see in general a "measured" astronomical mass, e.g. the mass determined by Kepler's third law in a regime where the Newtonian gravity is reproduced, can be different from the mass obtained from the redshift of the spectral lines as measured by a distant observer. We shall argue that this property can be useful to discriminate between GR and quadratic theories of gravity. We thus present the standard M -R for various values of the m0/m2 ratio and for different definitions of mass.
The plan of the paper is the following. In Section 2 the energy momentum tensor and the field equations are presented and their properties in the weak field limit are discussed. In Section 3 the numerical method is explained and a list of possible candidates to represent a local "measure" of the mass-energy in these space-times are discussed. Section 4 is devoted to the results and Section 5 contains the conclusions.

2 Energy-momentum tensor and field equations

2.1 General framework and equations We consider the equations of motion derived from the minimization of the action (1.1)

1 Gµ =  Rµ - 2 Rgµ
1 = 2 Tµ ,

Cµ + 2

(2.1)

and the static and spherically symmetric ansatz for the metric ds2 = -h(r) dt2 + dr2 + r2d2. f (r)

(2.2)

­2­

We take the stress-energy tensor with the standard perfect fluid form

Tµ = ((r) + p(r)) uµu + p(r) gµ,

(2.3)

with uµ a unit timelike vector. With the ansatz (2.2) there are only two independent equations of motion, and is possible to reduce the system to third order [10].

Grr - 2 Trr = 2 Ttt,

(2.4)

where X(r) and Y (r) are combinations of , , r, h(r), f (r), (r), p(r) and their first and second derivatives, are indeed third order equations respectively in h(r) and f (r). The conservation of the stress-energy tensor results in

h (r)

p (r) = -

((r) + p(r)),

2 h(r)

(2.5)

and with the addition of an equation of state

p(r) = P((r))

(2.6)

we have a full set of equation in the variables h(r), f (r), (r) and p(r), that are the homologous of the TOV equations of General Relativity. The full form of the equations (2.4) is cumbersome and not very instructive (see Appendix A), we note however that in the limit ,   0 the e.o.m. tensor Gµ becomes the Einstein tensor Gµ, and the combination

1

1

X(r)r Grr - 2 Trr + Y (r) Grr - 2 Trr

(2.7)

equals zero whenever the first equation of (2.4) and equation (2.5) are taken into consideration, thus recovering the GR limit.

2.2 Solutions in the weak field limit

The field equations (2.1) can be solved analytically in the weak field limit. It is convenient

to write

h(r) = 1 + V (r), f (r) = 1 + W (r),

(2.8)

and expand (2.1) at linear order in . The resulting equations are the following

where Y (r) = r-2 (rW (r)) and is set to 1 after the expansion, as described in [6, 10, 15]. In the vacuum case equations (2.9) can be solved by Fourier modes, and we obtain

that is the Schwarzschild metric with the addition of exponentially suppressed corrections. The equations (2.9) can be solved with similar methods also in the presence of a non zero stress-energy tensor and, on the outside of the star, still result in (2.11) with a dependence of the free parameters from the pressure and density as

(2.12)

in agreement with the result of [6] if (r) = M 3(x) and p(r) = 0. The relations (2.12) clearly
show that also in the p = 0 case, the energy-density of the matter component determines not only M but also the Yukawa coefficients S0- and S2-. It is therefore important to extend this analysis to the fully non-linear regime in order to study the physical implications of this
result.

3 Numerical methods and mass definition

3.1 The shooting method and the equation of state

The interior and exterior field configuration describing a compact stars can conveniently be obtained by means of the shooting method. We assume the weak field limit (2.11) to be valid at large distances, and integrate the e.o.m. with zero energy density and pressure to a radius r = R. At the same time we consider a regular power expansion

h(r) = h0(1 + h1 r + h2 r2 + ...), f (r) = f0 + f1 r + f2 r2 + ..., (r) = 0 + 1 r + 2 r2 + ..., p(r) = p0 + p1 r + p2 r2 + ...,

(3.1)

­4­

with free parameters h0, h2, f2, 0 close to the origin. We then integrate the e.o.m. (2.4-2.6) to the same radius r = R using (3.1) at fifth order as boundary conditions. To integrate the equations we used the Adaptive Stepsize Runge-Kutta integrator DO2PDF implemented by the NAG group (see https://www.nag.com for details) with a maximum tolerance of 10-9.
At radius R we obtain continuity of h(r), f (r), their first and second derivatives, (r) and p(r) as function of (M, S2-, S0-, h0, h2, f2, 0) by means of a globally convergent NewtonRaphson method, as described in http://numerical.recipes, with a tolerance of 10-6,
leaving only one free parameter. The radius R is then defined from the boundary condition (r = R ) = 0 as the surface of the star. As large radius we chose the value r = 18, in order to have Yukawa corrections larger than the tolerance threshold, while as small radius we used r0 = 10-3 in order to have the discarded terms of the series (3.1) smaller than the tolerance threshold. As equation of state to model the inside of neutron stars we opted for
two different choices: a simple polytropic model

p = k 

(3.2)

with  = 2 and k = 6.51185 · 10-17cm3/g, and a more realistic SLy equation of state [30, 31] in its analytical representation [32]

(3.3)

where the pressure and density are expressed respectively in dyn/cm2 and g/cm3, and the ai are numerical parameters that can be found in [32]. The polytropic e.o.s. is able to capture the qualitative behaviour of solutions and, being more easily integrated, has been used to show the dependence of the solutions from the relative values of the masses m0 and m2. The Sly e.o.s., on the other hand, is a good description of what is supposed to be the interior of a neutron star, and has been used in the discussion on mass definition in order to have realistic mass-radius relations.

3.2 Notes on adimensionalization and the scales of the solutions

The masses m2 and m0 in (2.11) naturally introduce energy and length scales for the solutions.

We choose the mass m2 (together with ¯h = c = 1) as natural unit for the adimensionalization

of the equations, introducing the parameter  = m0/m2. The choice has been made in order

to have a better comparison between the results of quadratic gravity and the ones of the

Einstein-Weyl theory [9, 10, 15]. A naturalness principle suggests values for  of order unity,

and the presence of  in the exponentials of (2.11) forces us to choose values such that

e- r r

>

tol,

where

tol

is

the

tolerance

threshold

of

the

Runge-Kutta

integrator.

For

these

reasons we opted to investigate  in the range [0.5 - 1.5], with a tolerance in the integration

of 10-12.

The analytical representation (3.3) is consistent only in the range of energy densities of order 104 - 1016 g/cm3, and it is clear that this sets a constraint on the scales of the solutions that can be described using such equation of state. In particular in our case we have that the dimensionful and dimensionless energy densities relate as

df

dl

1090 

g/cm3.

(3.4)

­5­

Having dimensionless values in the range of order 10-6 - 100 sets a minimum allowed value of  at no less than 1074. For the evaluation of (3.3), and while showing the results, we will restore physical units fixing the length scale l2 = 1/m2 equal to the Sun Schwarzschild radius rs, = 2 G M , in a similar, yet different, fashion to what have been done in [27]; the numerical value used for the parameter  is then actually of order 1074. This value exceed the 1060 laboratory limit obtained for the Yukawa correction to the gravitational potential [33, 34]. Although the above limits do not directly apply to us as the form of the Yukawa corrections in the weak limit are different from those discussed in [33, 34], we stress that the purpose of our paper is not to provide new constraints on possible modifications of the gravitational potential, rather to discuss the astrophysical properties of the compact star solutions of quadratic gravity.
3.3 Quasi local masses
The results of the weak-field limit showed that the coefficient of the 1/r component of the metric does not uniquely characterize the metric in these space-times. It is expected that in the strong field regime the contribution from the Yukawa terms significantly contribute to the mass-energy distribution. In these cases a quasi-local definition can be more appropriate to describe the physical phenomena, as already noticed in [25, 27]. According to this idea one associates a quasi-local mass-energy to a topologically 2-surface embedded in an asymptotically flat space-time. Various definitions (in principle there could be infinite) have appeared in the literature in classical general relativity [35, 36] as the requirement to be consistent with the "global" mass-energy of an asymptotically flat stationary space-time defined by the ADM mass [37] leaves much freedom in this respect. This latter is defined in terms of a 3+1 foliation of an asymptotically flat space-time and it is usually written as

E =  lim

dA ni (jgij - igjj) ,

r i,j

S2(r)

(3.5)

with ni the unit normal vector to the sphere S2(r). In our case we can safely use the weak field limit and, having exponentially suppressed corrections to the Schwarzschild solution, it is clear that results in the M parameter of (2.11). Useful definitions of quasi-local mass are instead the following.

Minser-Sharp mass Given a spherically symmetric space-time with metric

ds2 = gabdxadxb + r2d2

(3.6)

where gab is the induced metric in the effective 1+1 space-time, the Misner-Sharp mass is

defined as

r,ar,a

=

f (r)

=:

1

-

2M (xc) .
r

(3.7)

so that

1

MM -S (r)

=

r(1 2

-

f (r))

(3.8)

in our case. It was originally proposed by Misner and Sharp in the context of spherically

symmetric models of gravitational collapse [38] and it represents the mass-energy enclosed in

a spherical hypersurface at time t. It has been generalized by Hayward [36] beyond spherical

symmetry and it is widely used in quadratic theories of gravity [20­23, 29].

­6­

TOV mass In General Relativity the total mass-energy inside a spherical distribution of matter is obtained from the 00-component of the field equations, that with the Misner-Sharp mass definition and our conventions reads

M (r) = 1 r2 (r), 4

(3.9)

and which implies

r
M (r) = ds 4s2(s).
0

(3.10)

The integration extends to the surface r = R defined by (R) = 0 in the TolmanOppenheimer-Volkoff equations (TOV) for the relativistic stellar structure [39, 40], and

reaches the limit value MT OV . As it is well known, MT OV does not coincides with the proper mass inside the star, but fully describes the observational properties of a compact

object (neutron star) in General Relativity. This definition is strongly dependent from the

equation of motion of GR, however, being sensible in the weak field regime (2.12), it has been

used also in quadratic theories of gravity [24, 28].

Particle potential mass In order to define the mass of a star in terms of observational properties, Resco et al. proposed a definition based on the effective potential of a massive particle [25]. With our ansatz the particle equation of motion reads

(3.14)

The motivation behind this definition is conceptually very similar to the one of Resco et al.

(3.12), and in fact it could be derived from the particle equation of motion (3.11) imposing

that the energy on the right hand side is independent from the radial coordinate.

This definition, however, is particularly useful, being dependent only form the time compo-

nent of the metric and then associated with the redshift of a photon emitted at radius r and

measured at infinity

z(r) =

h(r)

(3.15)

and therefore it has already been used in modified theories of gravity [26].

­7­

Kepler's law mass Another measurable mass definition is the one that can be inferred from the orbital period using Kepler's third Law. Assuming that in some limit the Newtonian regime is recovered, one can define the Keplerian mass from a measure of orbital period T

r3 M T 2 = 42 .

(3.16)

The radial geodesic equation, in the case of a circular orbit on the equatorial plane, can be

written as

1 h (r) t2 - r 2 = 0 = 2

d 2 1 h (r)

(3.17)

and combined with (3.16) give rise to the definition

MKep(r)

(r).

(3.18)

Komar quasi-local mass As it is well known in a static space-time it is always possible to

define the mass in a natural way as the conserved quantity associated to the timelike Killing

vector

M = -4 S dA nµ -µ ,

(3.19)

where µ is the timelike Killing vector, S is a two dimensional surface and nµ is the unit

normal to such surface [41]. In General Relativity it can be proved that in the vacuum the

integral in (3.19) is independent from the choice of S, and the definition is well cast, while in

quadratic gravity this is possible only in the asymptotically infinite region. We can however

exploit the definition in (3.19) and consider it as the energy inside the surface S; as usual

with our ansatz and units it becomes

MKom(r)

f (r) h (r).

4 Numerical results
4.1 Stellar structure and global properties
A first insight on the effect of the two massive modes can be drawn from explicit star structures. We present in figure 1 the behaviour of the metric, scalar curvature and pressure for three stars with the same mass, but different values of  = m0/m2. While the general behaviour has no peculiarities and is similar to the one of General Relativity, with the exception of non zero curvature on the outside of the stars, the effect of the parameter  is far from trivial. From a point of view it seems that higher values of m0 with respect to m2 result in a softening of gravity, with smaller non relativistic gravitational potential (r)  1 - h(r) and smaller internal pressure. On the other hand, higher values of m0 result also in greater radial distortion and greater curvature on the inside of the stars. In particular the behaviour of the Ricci scalar is quite peculiar, with greater curvature for higher values of  on the inside and greater curvature for lower values of  on the outside. In order to understand this dependence, we have to remember that higher values of  mean that the CµCµ term is dominant with respect to the R2 term in the action (1.1), or, from a particle point of view, the range of the tensorial contribution to the gravitational

interaction is larger than the scalar one. The decrease of the potential well is then associated to the preponderance of negative energy Spin-2 ghosts with respect to the massive scalar particles. The behaviour of the Ricci scalar is better understood looking at the trace of the equation of motion (2.1)

on the inside. For lower values of , instead, we have that the presence of the fluid has

little effect on scalar curvature that, having imposed regularity in the origin and asymptotic

flatness, flattens out and gets closer to zero.

While the impact of  on star structures might be interesting from a theoretical point of view, what is more relevant from an astrophysical perspective is its impact on the free parameters of the solutions. In figure 2 we show the relations of the asymptotic ADM mass M with the star radius and central pressure. We note that the mass-radius relation is mainly affected by the value of  in the low mass and low density domain, leaving the maximum mass, where in General Relativity we have the onset of instability, almost unchanged. The softening of gravity for higher values of  here is manifest, with the same pressure being able to sustain greater stellar masses, and with the same mass being bounded in larger volumes. There is however a trend inversion close to the maximum mass, where the softening of gravity is associated with a dominance of the scalar contribution. The behaviour of the Yukawa parameters S2- and S0- shown in figure 3 may clarify different aspects. The scalar sector has somehow a predictable trend: it is always attractive, and the

associated charge S0- grows in order to contrast the decrease in range. The tensorial sector, on the contrary, can be both attractive and repulsive. In particular for values of  > 1 the contribution is always repulsive and the precise value has very little impact on the associated charge S2-, while for values  < 1 it becomes rapidly attractive. The trend inversion shown in the insets of figure 2 is then associated with the attractive nature of the tensorial mode in that range. We can then assume three possible behaviours in terms of the dependence from  = m0/m2:
· m0 > m2 the two Yukawa terms are competing, one being attractive and the other repulsive, and the scalar charge is larger than the tensorial one;
· m0  m2 the two Yukawa terms are competing, one being attractive and the other repulsive, and the scalar charge is of the same order than the tensorial one;
· m0 < m2 the two Yukawa terms are both attractive, and the scalar charge is smaller than the tensorial one.
For the discussion on mass definitions we then opted for the value  = 1.1, in order to have competing contributions of the same order and to avoid the fine tuned value  = 1.
4.2 Discrepancies in mass definitions as a possible deviation from General Relativity
We now move on the analysis of mass definitions in quadratic theories of gravity. The first point we want to stress is the importance of characterizing the external field in such

theories. With the assurance of having the Schwarzschild metric on the outside, standard TOV solving methods in General Relativity focus only on the interior, and star masses are defined by the value of some function, namely either the Misner-Sharp (3.7), the TOV (3.10) or the Newtonian (3.14) mass definition, at the star surface. Earlier works in quadratic theories of gravity used similar procedures [20­22, 24, 28, 29], opening the possibility to ambiguities in the definition of mass, as noted by [27]. More recent works agree on the need of using asymptotic limits in order to extract information on neutron star masses avoiding discrepancies [23, 25, 26], however considering only the asymptotic limit may discard some relevant information, and both approaches come with consequences. The characterization of the external field allows us to have no ambiguities and to lose no information. In figure 4 we show the mass-radius relations for the mass definitions of subsection 3.3, evaluated at different distances from the star surface d = r - R. Each definition has its specific mass-radius relation, and its specific dependence from the distance d, although it is a general feature that they coincide with the asymptotic limit after few solar Schwarzschild radius from the surface, with the exception of the TOV mass that is identically identified by its value at

the star surface. The large variety in the possible mass-radius relations of the same class of solutions leaves us with two possible approaches to the interpretation of mass in quadratic gravity:
· the only meaningful definition of mass is the asymptotic one M , and in order to completely define the gravitational field we have to measure the tensorial and scalar charges S2- and S0-;
· each mass definition describes a particular physical property of the star, and any star analysis has to consider carefully which aspect is under investigation.
In agreement with [27], we believe that the second approach is the most powerful one, given that it is less reliant on the underlying theory of gravity. In particular we can reverse our point of view and state that the presence of discrepancies between different mass definitions can be taken as a strong indication of departure from General Relativity. For example let us consider a neutron star with an orbiting planet: we can estimate the mass of this star from the planetary transit of its satellite using the third Kepler's law, and also from the redshift of photons emitted at the surface and measured at infinity. For the former measurement we have to use the Keplerian definition (3.18) in function of the distance of the planet from the star, for the latter we have to use the Newtonian definition (3.14) evaluated at the star surface. In figure 5 we show the difference between the two measurements for the case of six different stars with asymptotic ADM masses between [0.5 - 2.642] M . Albeit the large range of possibilities for the masses m2 and m0 might render problematic in practice to strongly constraint the predictions of the quadratic theory, it is also clear that the ambiguity in the definitions of mass in these theories can be conveniently exploited to define deviations from classical General Relativity.
5 Conclusions
In this paper we studied self gravitating fluid solutions of quadratic gravity in their entirety. In particular, thanks to an implementation of the shooting method, we linked the effects of quadratic curvature terms on the fluid to explicit Yukawa corrections of the external Newtonian potential. The relative weights of the masses of the two Yukawa particles determine

­ 12 ­

either a softening or hardening of gravity, with opposite effects for low and high mass stars, and an increase or decrease in spatial deformation. These behaviours are linked with an either attractive or repulsive nature of one of the contributions to the gravitational interaction, and to different relative values of the associated charges. The global scales of the solution, instead, are completely determined by the value of one of the two free parameters in the action, which are only mildly constrained. In the last subsection we analyzed different mass-radius relations for realistic neutron stars, taking into account different viable mass definitions evaluated at different distances from the stars. The large variety in the obtained relations, together with the additional variation due to the free parameters of the theory and the equation of state, suggests that quadratic gravity is a more effective tool if used to look for deviations from General Relativity. It would be important to extend our analysis to the study of the stability of the solutions as a function of the  parameter and we plan to address this problem in future. Acknowledgements.
