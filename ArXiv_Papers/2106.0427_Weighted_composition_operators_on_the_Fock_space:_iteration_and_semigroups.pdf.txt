WEIGHTED COMPOSITION OPERATORS ON THE FOCK SPACE: ITERATION AND SEMIGROUPS
I. CHALENDAR AND J.R. PARTINGTON
Abstract. This paper considers discrete and continuous semigroups of (weighted) composition operators on the Fock space. For discrete semigroups consisting of powers of a single operator, the asymptotic behaviour of the semigroups is analysed. For continuous semigroups and groups, a full classification of possible semigroups is given, and the generator is calculated.

1. Introduction and notation

For 1   <  the Fock space F  consists of all entire functions f : C  C such that the norm

f  :=



1/
|f (z)|e-|z|2/2 dm(z)

2 C

is finite.

Note that for k  0 we have

,

from which we see that the functions en, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . such that



(1)

en(z) = zn/ n!

form an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space F 2. For entire functions w, , f we define the composition operator C by
Cf = f   and the weighted composition operator Ww, by Ww,f = wCf .
Carswell, MacCluer and Schuster [8] characterised the bounded composition operators C on F 2 as follows:

Proposition 1.1. The operator C is bounded on F 2 if and only if one of the following conditions holds:

· (z) = az + b with |a| < 1, b  C; · (z) = az with |a| = 1.

In the case |a| < 1 the operator C is compact.

For weighted composition operators Ww, we have the result of Le [15], extended by Hai and Khoi [13] as follows:

Proposition 1.2. The weighted composition operator Ww, with w not identically zero is bounded on F  if and only if both the following conditions hold:
· w  F; · M (w, ) := supzC |w(z)|2e(|(z)|2-|z|2) < .
Moreover, in this case (z) = az + b with |a|  1. If |a| = 1 then we also have

(2)

w(z) = w(0)e-baz

for z  C.

See also [7] for a recent discussion of these results.

Zhao [17] gave a criterion for the invertibility of a weighted composition operator on the Fock space; using the more recent results above we can simplify this as follows.
Proposition 1.3. A weighted composition Ww, is invertible on F  if and only if (z) = az + b with |a| = 1, and w(z) = w(0)e-baz with w(0) = 0.
Proof. Suppose that g(z) = w(z)f (az + b) with 0 < |a|  1. Then f ()w(a-1 - a-1b) = g(a-1 - a-1b) for   C. Hence the inverse of Ww, is also a weighted composition operator Wv, with () = -1() = a-1 - a-1b, and thus |a| = 1 if Wv, is bounded. We also

have a formula for w, namely (2). Similarly,

v(z) = v(0)eaba-1z = v(0)ebz

and since

1/w(a-1z - a-1b) = w(0)-1eba(a-1z-a-1b)

we find that v(z) = 1/w(a-1z - a-1b) if v(0) = w(0)-1e-|b|2.

This result will be of further use to us when we discuss groups of weighted composition operators.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we study the asymptotics of iteration of bounded composition operators on Fock spaces. Theorem 2.2 is a complete answer to this problem. Then we consider C0 semigroups of composition operators (Ct)t0, providing explicit expressions of the semiflow (t)t0 in Theorem 2.3. We also prove that every C0 semigroup (Tt)t0 on F 2 with generator Af = Gf  is a semigroup of composition operators, which implies that G(z) = az + b with Re(a)  0 and b  C. Moreover the convergence in norm as t   of such (Tt)t0 is equivalent to the condition Re(a) < 0. We end this section with Theorem 2.10, which is a criterion, on the space F 2 and for a generator A, for generating an analytic semigroup of composition operators.
Section 3 is concerned with weighted composition operators Ww,. We first characterize, in Theorem 3.1, the weights for which Ww, is power-bounded on F  in the particular case where (z) = az + b with |a| = 1. The case |a| < 1 is much more delicate. We restrict our study to the case when the weight w does not vanish, which is the relevant situation for semigroups of weighted composition operators, as shown in Theorem 3.7. We consider two cases and split our results into Theorem 3.3 and Theorem 3.4. We also derive a result on the converegnce on the asymptotic behaviour of the iterates of Ww, in Corollary 3.6, thanks to the description of its eigenvalues and eigenspaces described in Theorem 3.5. The last part of the paper is a complete description

4

of C0 semigroups and C0 groups of weighted composition operators on F.

2. Composition operators
We begin with (unweighted) composition operators, where some fairly complete results will be derived.

2.1. Iteration. Note first that for a composition operator C with (z) = az + b, we have

Cnf (z) = f

anz + 1 - an b 1-a

for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,

as is easily seen by induction.

There is a general convergence criterion for powers of an operator

T  L(X), where X is a Banach space, which may be found in [4,

A-III, Sec. 3.7]; it was applied to composition operators in [3], and to

weighted composition operators in [9]. An operator T  L(X) is power-bounded if supn1 T n < .

Proposition 2.1. Let T  L(X) be power-bounded. Then the following assertions are equivalent: (i) P := lim T n exists in L(X) and is of finite rank. (ii) (a) re(T ) < 1; (b) p(T )  T  {1}; (c) if 1 is in (T ) then it is a pole of the resolvent of order 1. In that case, P is the residue at 1.

The following formula for C is given in [8] (see also [10]). If (z) = az + b with |a| < 1, then

(3)

C = exp

1 |b|2 4 1 - |a|2

.

Using these result we may prove the following.

Theorem 2.2. The asymptotics of iteration of bounded composition operators on the Fock space F  are as follows.

WEIGHTED COMPOSITION OPERATORS

(1) If (z) = az with |a| = 1 and a = 1 then the sequence (Cn) consists of unitary operators; it does not converge, even weakly.
(2) If (z) = az + b with |a| < 1 then the sequence (Cn) converges in norm to the operator mapping a function f to the constant
function with value f (b/(1 - a)).

Proof. In the first case the operators Cn are clearly unitary; by considering the function f (z) = z and Cnf (z) = f (anz) we see that weak convergence does not hold.

In the second case, the operator C is power-bounded by (3) since if

an

=

an

and

bn

=

1-an 1-a

b,

then

|bn|/(1-|an|)



|b|2/|1-a|2.

Now we

can

use Proposition 2.1. Since C is compact, we have re(C) = 0. For the

point spectrum we suppose there is an eigenvalue  and eigenfunction

f satisfying f (az + b) = f (z). Iterating, we have

(4)

f (anz + b(1 - an)/(1 - a)) = nf (z).

That is, nf (z)  f (b/(1 - a)); but z was arbitrary, so f is identically 0 if || = 1 but  = 1.
Finally, if 1  (C) then it is an eigenvalue, since C is compact. Then (4) still holds for an eigenfunction f , and f (z) = f (b/(1 - a)) so f is constant.
Since ker(Id - C) is 1-dimensional, we see that 1 is a pole of the resolvent of order at most 1. Thus (Cn) converges in norm, and the limit is the same as the pointwise limit, namely the rank-1 operator T with T f (z) = f (b/(1 - a)) for all f .

2.2. Semigroups. The theory of C0 semigroups (strongly continuous semigroups) is well described in many books, for example [1, 11, 16].
Recall that a C0 semigroup (Tt)t0 of bounded operators on a Banach space X satisfies the conditions
(1) T0 = Id; (2) Ts+t = TtTs for all s, t  0; (3) the mapping t  Ttx is continuous for all x  X.

6

I. CHALENDAR AND J.R. PARTINGTON

The infinitesimal generator A of such a semigroup (Tt)t0 is defined by

(5)

Ax

=

lim
t0

Ttx - t

x

(x  dom(A)).

In the situation when Tt = Wwt,t for all t  0 we therefore have

W = W W = W , ws+t,s+t

ws,s wt,t

ws (wt s ),t s

so that

ws+t = ws(wt  s) and s+t = t  s.

We write C- := {z  C : Re z < 0}.

Theorem 2.3. A semigroup of bounded composition operators (Tt)t0 = (Ct)t0 on F  satisfies one of the following for t > 0:
(1) t(z) = exp(t)z + C(exp(t) -1) for some   C- and C  C; (2) t(z) = exp(t)z for some   iR.
The infinitesimal generator is given by Af (z) = (z + C)f (z), where C = 0 in case (ii). Moreover (Tt)t0 converges in norm as t   if and only if   C-, and it converges to the operator mapping a function f to the constant function with value f (-C).

Proof. From Proposition 1.1 we may write t(z) = atz + bt; we have at+s = atas, so at = exp(t) for some   C- := {z  C : Re z  0} (if at is identically zero then the semigroup is not strongly continuous at 0 since it would require f (bt)  f (z) as t  0 for all functions f and for all z  C). Also, bs+t = atbs + bt = asbt + bs. Thus we have

bs(exp(t) - 1) = bt(exp(s) - 1),

i.e., bt = C(exp(t) - 1) for some constant C  C. If Re  = 0, then by Proposition 1.2 we have boundedness only for C = 0.

Then we have

Af (z)

=

lim
t0

f (etz

C (et t

-

f (z)

=

(z

+

C)f (z).

The last assertion is an obvious corollary of Theorem 2.2.

Remark 2.4. If t(z) = exp(t) + C(exp(t) - 1) then by (3), on the Fock space F , we have

(6)

Tt = exp

1 |C2(exp(t) - 1)|2

4

1 - |e2t|

.

A routine calculation shows that

| exp(t) - 1|2 1 - |e2t|

=

O(t)

as t  0. Hence (Tt) is a quasicontractive semigroup.

In [5, Thm. 3.9] It was show that the following conditions are equivalent for a semigroup with generator A : f  G(z)f (z) on the Hardy space H2, where G  H2:
(1) A generates a C0 semigroup of composition operators on H2(D); (2) A generates a quasicontractive semigroup on H2(D); (3) ess supzT Re zG(z)  0.
The analogous condition on G which applies in the case of the Fock space is

(7)

lim sup Re zG(z)  0.

|z|

Proposition 2.5. For an entire function G condition (7) holds if and only if G(z) = az + b with either (i) a  C- and b  C, or else (ii) a  iR and b = 0.

Proof. Since z(az + b) = a|z|2 + bz, it is clear that functions G of the form above do satisfy (7).
Conversely, for an entire function G let F (z) = (G(z) - G(0))/z. Thus zG(z) = |z|2F (z) + zG(0). For G to satisfy (7) we must have Re |z|2F (z) + zG(0) < 1, and hence Re F (z) + G(0)/z < 1, for sufficiently large |z|. This is clearly impossible if F is a nonconstant polynomial, and also impossible if F has an essential singularity at  (for example, by the Weierstrass­Casorati theorem). So F must be constant, and the conditions on a and b are now immediate.

8

I. CHALENDAR AND J.R. PARTINGTON

Next we consider the numerical range of a semigroup generator A : f  G(z)f (z) on the Fock space, namely

W (A) = { Af, f : f  D(A)},

where D(A) denotes the domain of A. Recall that a semigroup if quasicontractive, that is, for some   R Tt  et for all t  0, if and only if W (A) is contained in some right half-plane.

Proposition 2.6. If an entire function G is such that the operator A : f  Gf  is the generator of a quasicontractive C0 semigroup on F 2, then G is a polynomial of degree at most 1, say, G(z) = az + b, with Re a  0.

Proof. We write G(z) =

 k=0

gk

zk

and

examine

the

coefficients

gk.

First, we calculate Af, f for f (z) = en(z) as defined in (1).

Af, f = Gf , f = g1n zn, zn /n! = ng1.

Now if A generates a quasicontractive C0 semigroup, there must be an upper bound on Re W (A), and hence Re g1  0.
Next, consider the function f (z) = azn +bzn+m where m  1 is fixed. We see that f 2 = |a|2n! + |b|2(n + m)!.
Also

Af, f = Gf , f = g1(|a|2n! + |b|2(n + m)!) + gm+1ab(n + m)!.

Now take a = nm/2 where || = 1, and b = 1, so that f 2 = O(n!nm) and

Af, f = g1(nmn! + (n + m)!) + gm+1(nm/2)(n + m)!.

That is, if gm+1 = 0, then for a suitable choice of , Re Af, f / f 2 grows as |gm+1|nm/2 as n  ; hence gm+1 = 0 for all m  1 if A is the generator of a quasicontractive C0 semigroup.

We can now go further and describe all semigroups with generators A : f  Gf . In [2] there is a result applying to function spaces, i.e., Banach spaces X of holomorphic functions on a domain  for which

WEIGHTED COMPOSITION OPERATORS

point evaluations are continuous functionals. The result applies to such spaces satisfying the following supplementary condition:
(E) If (zn) is a sequence in  such that zn  z    {} and lim f (zn) exists in C for all f  X then z  .

Theorem 2.7. Suppose that (Tt)t0 is a C0 semigroup on a function space X with property (E) such that the generator A is the operator f  Gf  for all f  dom(A) for some G  Hol(). Then (Tt) is a semigroup of composition operators.

Similar results are given in [12], for function spaces on the disc D.

Theorem 2.7 clearly applies to the space X = F 2 with  = C and so we have the following corollary.
Corollary 2.8. Every C0 semigroup on F 2 with generator A : f  Gf  for some G  Hol(C) consists entirely of composition operators.
We may also consider the case of analytic semigroups, analogously to [6]. For 0 <  < /2 we define the sector  by
 = {rei : r > 0, || < },
and recall that an analytic (or holomorphic) semigroup is one for which there is an analytic mapping T :   L(X) satisfying the semigroup property, and which, on defining T (0) = Id, is strongly continuous at 0, and satisfies supD T < .
We may test the analytic property by using Corollary 2.3 of [6], which asserts that if A is a Hilbert-space operator and A and e±iA generate quasicontractive semigroups for some 0 <  < /2, then A generates an analytic semigroup on the sector .
As a variation on Corollary 2.5 of [6], we also have the following result.
Lemma 2.9. Let (Tt)t0 be a semigroup of composition operators on F 2 and suppose that it has an analytic extension to  for some 0 <

10

I. CHALENDAR AND J.R. PARTINGTON

 < /2. Then for every    the operator T is a composition operator.

Proof. We note first that, writing en(z) = zn for z  C we have Tt(en) = (Tt(e1))n for all n  N and t  0. Now defining F () = Ten - (Te1)n we have that   F ()(z0) is an analytic function on  for each z0  C; it vanishes on R+, and hence is identically zero. Thus by linearity and continuity T = C for each , where  = Te1.
We thus have the following result.

Theorem 2.10. For an entire function G the operator A : f  Gf  is the generator of an analytic semigroup of operators on F 2 if and only if there is   (0, /2) such that

(8)

lim sup Re ±eizG(z)  0.

|z|

In this case, the semigroup consists of composition operators and is

quasicontractive.

3. Weighted composition operators
As is the case for weighted composition operators on other function spaces, the results that one can prove are necessarily less complete than the results for (unweighted) composition operators. Nevertheless we may make some progress here.

3.1. Iteration. For the weighted composition operator Ww, we have

Wwn,f (z) = w(z)w((z))w(2(z)) . . . w(n-1(z))f

anz

+

1 - an 1-a

b

for n = 1, 2, 3, . . ., where we denote the kth iterate of  by k.

A necessary and sufficient condition for boundedness of Ww, on F  is given above in Proposition 1.2.
We do not have an exact expression for the norm of a weighted composition operator, but from [13] we know that for (z) = az + b

WEIGHTED COMPOSITION OPERATORS

11

with |a|  1 we have

(9)

M (w, )  Ww,  M (w, )/|a|.

Writing Mz(w, ) = |w(z)|2e(|(z)|2-|z|2) we have that Ww, is compact if and only if |a| < 1 and Mz(w, )  0 as |z|  .

For power-boundedness, it is possible to give an exact answer in the case |a| = 1.

Theorem 3.1. Suppose that (z) = az + b with |a| = 1. Then Ww, is power-bounded on F  if and only if |w(0)|  e-|b|2/2.

Proof. (i) We begin with the case a = 1, and with w(z) = w(0)e-baz we have

Wwn,f (z) = w(z)w(z + b) . . . w(z + (n - 1)b)f (z + nb).
That is, it is a weighted composition operator of the form Wwn,n, and we have
Mz (wn, n) = |wn(z)|2e|n(z)|2-|z|2 = |w(0)|2n|e-2bz| |e-2b(z+b)| . . . |e-2b(z+(n-1)b)|e|z+nb|2-|z|2 = |w(0)|2n|e-2nbz|e-n(n-1)|b|2 e2 Re nzben2|b|2 = |w(0)|2nen|b|2

and this is uniformly bounded in n (and z) if and only if |w(0)|  e-|b|2/2.
(ii) For a  T \ {1} we have

so that sup Mz(wn, n)  K|w(0)|2ne|b|2(n-1),

where K is independent of n; hence uniform boundedness of the powers Wwn, on F  is again equivalent to the condition |w(0)|  e-|b|2/2.

The analysis is apparently intractable in the case |a| < 1, however we may consider the case when the weight w does not vanish, which will be of importance when we come to consider semigroups. In this case, writing  = 1 - |a|2 we have the following result from [7].

Theorem 3.2. For (z) = az + b with |a| < 1 and w nonvanishing the operator Ww, is bounded on F  if and only if
w(z) = ep+qz+rz2

and either:

(i) |r| < /2, in which case Ww, is compact on F , or

(ii) |r| = /2 and, with t = q + ba, one has either t = 0 or else t = 0

and

The analysis splits into two cases: Case 1. We take (z) = az + b with 0 < |a| < 1, and w(z) = ep+qz. That is, r = 0. Here we once again have (10) with w(0) = ep but to check boundedness all we have is (9). Case 2. We take (z) = az + b with 0 < |a| < 1, and w(z) = ep+qz+rz2 with 0 < |r|  /2. In Case 1, we now have

Mz(wn, n) = |wn(z)|2e|n(z)|2-|z|2

Taking logarithms, we have the following:

Theorem 3.3. In Case 1:

if Re p + Re

> 0 then Ww, is not power-bounded on F ;

if Re p + Re

qb 1-a

- ln |a| < 0 then Ww, is power-bounded on F .

Proof. In (11) we have that an  0, and the asymptotic behaviour of supz Mz(wn, n) depends only on the first and third factors. Now use (9).

Note that this matches the condition of Theorem 3.1 if |a| = 1 and q = -ba.
In Case 2 we have the extra factor v(z) = erz2 in the weight, and Then

We therefore have the following result:

if Re p + Re

then Ww, is power-bounded on F .

Proof. We again have that an  0, and the asymptotic behaviour of supz Mz(wn, n) is as in Case 1, with the additional terms from A and C. Once more we use (9).

Coming to the question of convergence of iterates, we note that if |r| < (1 - |a|2)/2, then Ww, is compact, and so its essential spectrum is {0}. We now consider the point spectrum.

Theorem 3.5. For a compact weighted composition operator Ww, on F  with w not the zero function, (z) = az + b and 0 < |a| < 1, the
point spectrum consists of simple eigenvalues.

Proof. The mapping  has a Denjoy­Wolff point   C, i.e., a solution to () = , namely  = b/(1 - a), to which all its iterates converge pointwise.

Factorizing out any possible zeros, we may write


w( + z) = zN exp( dnzn),

and let us suppose that Ww,f = f with


f ( + z) = zM exp( cnzn).

Now ( + z) = a( + z) + b =  + az, so we have

We thus have N = 0, and  = aM ed0; moreover, for some k  Z

at least on some disc {|z| < r}. So k = 0 and cn = dn/(1 - an).

Thus the eigenvector (if it is in the space) is unique up to a constant

factor.

Putting all these ideas together along with Proposition 2.1 we arrive at the following result.

Corollary 3.6. For a nontrivial compact and power-bounded weighted composition Ww, on F  with (z) = az + b and 0 < |a| < 1, let  = b/(1-a). Then, provided that aM w()  T\{1} for all M = 0, 1, 2, . . ., the sequence (Wwn,) converges in norm to the operator mapping f either to the constant function f () if w() = 1, otherwise to the zero
function.

3.2. Semigroups and groups. For semigroups of weighted composition operators, say, Ttf (z) = wt(z)f (t(z)), we must have the relation ws+t = ws(wt  s) and s+t = t  s so if t(z) = atz + bt we obtain

(12)

wt+s(z) = ws(z)wt(asz + bs) = wt(z)ws(atz + bt)

while at+s = atas and bs+t = atbs + bt = asbt + bs.

Theorem 3.7. A C0 semigroup Ttf (z) = wt(z)f (t(z)) (t  0) of weighted composition operators on the Fock space F  has one of the following two expressions;
(1) t(z) = exp(t)z + C(exp(t) -1) for some   C- and C  C; in which case wt = ept+qtz+rtz2 with pt, qt, zt given respectively by (15), (14) and (13) below.
(2) t(z) = exp(t)z + C(exp(t) - 1) for some   iR and C  C, in which case wt(z) = wt(0) exp(C(exp(t) -1)z) and moreover wt(0) = eµte|C|2(et-1) for some µ  C.

Proof. The formula for t follows as in Theorem 2.3. We now have two cases to analyse:
(1). The proof of [14, Lem. 2.1(b)], can be adapted and simplified to show that w(z) = 0 for all t  0 and z  C.
For if there are a z0  C and t0  0 with wt0(z0) = 0, then let I = {t  0 : wt(z0) = 0} and  = inf I. Since the semigroup is strongly continuous we have   I by considering the effect of the semigroup on a constant function; also  > 0 since w0(z) = 1 for all z. By (12) we have I = [, ) and, taking s =  /2, we have

wt(z0)ws(atz0 + bt) = wt+s(z0) = 0
for all t  ( /2,  ) and hence ws(atz0 + bt) = 0 for all such t. Hence ws is identically zero, as it is zero on a nontrivial continuous path.

Now, by Theorem 3.2, wt(z) takes the form wt(z) = exp(pt + qtz + rtz2).
From (12) we have pt+s + qt+sz + rt+sz2 = ps + qsz + rsz2 + pt + qt(asz + bs) + rt(asz + bs)2, For extra legibility, write x = exp(s) and y = exp(t); then as = x and bs = C(x - 1); so the equations we have are pt+s + qt+sz + rt+sz2 = ps + qsz + rsz2 + pt + qt(asz + bs) + rt(asz + bs)2,

giving

pt+s = ps + pt + qtbs + rtb2s, qt+s = qs + qtas + 2rtasbs, rt+s = rs + a2srs. Thus rt+s = rs + rtx2, for which the general solution is rs = (1 - x2) or

(13)

rt = (1 - e2t)

for some   C. (It is easy to check that rt/(1 - e2t) is necessarily constant.) The constant  must also be such that |rt|  (1 - |at|2)/2 by virtue of Theorem 3.2.

Next qt+s = qs + qtx + 2C(1 - y2)x(x - 1), which has solution qs = 2Cx(1 - x) + (1 - x) or

(14)

qt = 2Cet(1 - et) + (1 - et)

for some   C.

Finally, pt+s = ps + pt + 2C2y(1 - y)(x - 1) + C(1 - y)(x - 1) + C2(1 - y2)(x - 1)2, giving ps = -C2(x - 1)2 - C(x - 1) + s or

(15)

pt = -C2(et - 1)2 - C(et - 1) + t

for some   C.

(2). We require wt(z) = wt(0)e-btatz to satisfy (12), that is, wt+s(0)e-bs+tas+tz = ws(0)e-bsaszwt(0)e-btat(asz+bs).

Observe that that is,

bs+tas+t = bsas + btatas,

C(e-(s+t) - 1)e(s+t) = C(e-s - 1)es + C(e-t - 1)etes,

since

1 - e(s+t) = 1 - es + (1 - et)es

18

I. CHALENDAR AND J.R. PARTINGTON

holds for all s and t. We also have wt+s(0) = ws(0)wt(0)e-btatbs = wt(0)ws(0)e-bsasbt
since for this to happen we require |C|2(1 - et)(es - 1) = |C|2(1 - es)(et - 1)

which holds for all s and t. Finally,

wt+s(0) = ws(0)wt(0)e|C|2(et-1)(es-1)

or, with vt = wt(0)e-|C|2(et-1),

vt+s

=

v v e|C|2((et-1)(es-1)-(e(t+s)-1)+(et-1)+(es-1) st

=

vsvt

so that finally wt(0) = eµte|C|2(et-1) for some µ  C.

Remark 3.8. We may also calculate infinitesimal generators using (5), so that for Tt(f )(z) = wt(z)f (t(z)) with
wt(z) = exp(pt + qtz + rtz2) and t(z) = atz + bt

we have

Finally, we may characterise one-parameter groups of weighted composition operators, using Proposition 1.3 and Theorem 3.7.

Corollary 3.9. A C0 group Ttf (z) = wt(z)f (t(z)) (t  R) of weighted composition operators on the Fock space F  satisfies
t(z) = exp(t)z + C(exp(t) - 1) for some   iR and C  C, in which case
wt(z) = wt(0) exp(C(exp(t) - 1)z) and moreover wt(0) = eµte|C|2(et-1) for some µ  C.

Proof. The first case of Theorem 3.7 does not give bounded inverses,
but in the second case where at = et and bt = C(et - 1) with   iR, we do have a-t = a-t 1 and b-t = -a-t 1bt; also w-t(0) = wt(0)-1e-|bt|2, so that T-t = Tt-1 by Proposition 1.3.

Remark 3.10. It is also possible to consider the question of when a weighted composition semigroup has an analytic extension, analogously to Theorem 2.10. However, the question is simply whether e±iA also generates a semigroup for some 0 <  < /2, which reduces to considering the semigroups in Theorem 3.7 with a complex parameter. Accordingly, we omit the details.
