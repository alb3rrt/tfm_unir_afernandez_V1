The Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson (CKN) bound formulates the condition that black hole is not produced by the low energy effective field theory dynamics. In de Sitter space it also constrains the maximal size of the matter distribution to be smaller than the cosmological horizon determined by black hole. On the other hand, the swampland distance conjecture (SDC) predicts that de Sitter space becomes unstable by the descent of the low energy degrees of freedom from UV. This results in the rapid increase in the energy inside the cosmological horizon, the distribution of which can be constrained by the CKN bound. We study the CKN bound in de Sitter space in detail and point out that when the SDC is combined, the bound on the slow-roll parameter which forbids the eternal inflation is obtained.

INTRODUCTION
The swampland program [1] (for reviews, see [2, 3]) aims at finding out bounds on the low energy effective field theory (EFT) parameter space consistent with quantum gravity. The swampland distance conjecture (SDC) [4] provides the string-inspired explanation to these bounds by assuming that all parameters but the string length are determined by the dynamical stabilization of the moduli. It claims that as we move from any point in the allowed parameter region to the boundary, some modulus has traversed trans-Planckian geodesic distance and an infinite tower of states becomes exponentially light. Then the `species cutoff' [5, 6], above which gravity is no longer weakly coupled to matter, falls off drastically, which signals the breakdown of the EFT.
Combined with the covariant entropy bound [7], the SDC is used to support the de Sitter (dS) swampland conjecture (dSC) [8] (see also [9­11] for a refined version) which claims the quantum instability of dS space. The excitations of the increasing number of light degrees of freedom along the trajectory of the inflaton, the modulus responsible for the vacuum energy, result in the rapid increase in the entropy. Once this new entropy contribution exceeds the covariant entropy bound given by the horizon area, the EFT defined below the almost constant cosmological horizon scale H is no longer valid [11] (for relevant discussions, see, e.g., [12, 13]). From this we can estimate the duration of the quasi-dS phase [14, 15], which is similar to that suggested by the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture [16] but enhanced by the slow-roll parameter.
The argument above illustrates how the excitations of a large number of states deform the cosmological horizon in thermodynamic language. Meanwhile, such a rapid production of matter also enhances the energy inside the cosmological horizon and furthermore, may result in the formation of black hole, in which case quantum gravity is no longer irrelevant to the particle interactions. The sim-

ilar issue was considered by Cohen, Kaplan, and Nelson (CKN) [17]. They pointed out that for the EFT defined in the region of the size L to be valid, the UV cutoff should be low enough not to produce black hole through the EFT dynamics. It also reads that matter should not be concentrated within the radius of black hole having the same amount of energy. In flat space, this condition is written as

L34UV LMP2l, or UV

which is more stringent than the Bekenstein entropy bound [18].
We can also impose that black hole is not produced in the dS background for the validity of the EFT description. This dS CKN bound was formulated in [19], which also constrains the maximal size of the matter distribution to be smaller than the cosmological horizon determined by the backreaction of black hole. We expect from the SDC that as the inflaton moves in quasi-dS space, a large amount of matter is produced inside the cosmological horizon. Then the maximal size of the matter distribution is identified with the deformed cosmological horizon. The dS CKN bound in [19] requires that this deformed horizon is smaller than the cosmological horizon determined by black hole of the same energy. In this article, we investigate the physical implications of this SDC-assisted dS CKN bound.
The plan of this article is as follows. After summarizing essential features of the SDC, we formulate the dS CKN bound in [19] more concretely. Then we focus on the specific limit GM H 1, where M is interpreted as a total energy, to describe the contraction of the cosmological horizon at the early stage of the matter production analytically. By combining the SDC with the dS CKN bound, we provide the EFT validity condition in terms of the observable slow-roll parameters. As we will see, our condition forbids the eternal inflation.

SWAMPLAND DISTANCE CONJECTURE

Before considering the CKN bound, we briefly review aspects of the SDC relevant to our discussion. The universality of the gravitational interaction implies that given the UV cutoff scale UV and N particle species of the EFT, the strength of the gravitational interaction is given by grav = N (UV/MPl)2. Thus, if grav is O(1), the EFT weakly coupled to gravity is no longer valid, which sets the species cutoff sp = MPl/ N .
On the other hand, the SDC assumes the existence of a tower of states, the mass gap of which depends on some modulus  as m = MPlexp[-], where  is the geodesic distance traversed by  in Planck unit and  is a model dependent O(1) constant. Taking an ansatz N = (MPl/m) for the number of particle species below sp, the requirement

gives  = 2/3, or [20]

The semi-classical EFT on the (quasi-)dS background has a natural UV cutoff scale H [21, 22] (see also [23, 24]). For this EFT to be valid against the SDC, H sp must be satisfied, which reads

H

This bound indeed is consistent with the entropy argument of [11] which supports the dSC. The low energy excitations interacting with the (quasi-)dS background can be regarded in thermal equilibrium with the GibbonsHawking temperature T = H/(2) [25]. The condition that their contribution to the entropy inside the horizon given by S  N T 3H-3  N cannot exceed the covariant entropy bound MP2l/H2 gives the same bound on  as (4).
We note that in the entropy argument above, we used N T 3  N H3, rather than N 3sp for the entropy density. For this estimation to be valid, the number density of states having the energy in the range H < M < sp needs to be Boltzmann-suppressed such that N exp[-M/T ] < 1. At the early stage of the inflaton excursion, i.e.,  1, this is trivially satisfied. As  gets close to the bound in (4), N becomes exponentially large enough to overcome the Boltzmann-suppression factor, but then sp is close to H. Thus, in any case, we can employ N H3 for the entropy density. For example, the states having the energy M sp are not negligible if

becomes positive. For H < 1013-14GeV which is consistent with the recent Planck observation [26], this happens after  (0.9)[(3/)] log(MPl/H), at which sp is very close to H. For the same reason, we use  N H4 for the energy density throughout this article.

DS CKN BOUND

The CKN bound [17] stems from the requirement that black hole cannot be the low energy excitation, or equivalently, the total energy inside the given volume is sufficiently low that black hole is not produced. In this section, we apply this argument to the dS background.
An uncharged, nonrotating black hole in the dS background is described by the Schwarzschild-dS geometry,

Here, one of three solutions to f (r) = 0 is negative.
When another two solutions r1, r2 to f (r) = 0 are real and positive (r1 < r2), f (r) is positive for r1 < r < r2 then r1 and r2 are interpreted as the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon, respectively.

FIG. 1. The behavior of F (x) = c - x + x3 for two extreme cases, c = 0 and c = 2/33/2. For 0 < c < 2/33/2, F (x) lies between two curves and both the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon are well defined. We note that for any value of c, F (x) has a local maximum at x = 1/ 3.

From this observation, [19] suggested the dS CKN bound by simply requiring f (r) > 0. Here we investigate this bound more quantitatively and discuss what happens when the SDC is additionally taken into account. For this purpose, we use the dimensionless parameter x = Hr, such that f (r) is rewritten as

1 f (r) = -

thus f (r) > 0 for F (x) > 0. As depicted in Fig. 1, we find that F (x) = 0, or equivalently, f (r) = 0 has two

positive solutions for 0 < 2GM < (2/33/2)H-1. When 2GM =(2/33/2)H-1, F (x) vanishes at a local maximum x = 1/ 3 so two real solutions match. This shows that as the mass of black hole increases, the cosmological horizon decreases until it coincides with the black hole horizon. Introducing a parameter  defined as

We note that as  increases over the region /2 <  < , which is equivalent to the increase in 2GM from 0 to (2/33/2)H-1, r1 monotonically increases from 0 to (1/ 3)H-1whereas r2 monotonically decreases from H-1 to (1/ 3)H-1. That is, r2 is always larger than r1. In perfect dS, in which the cosmological horizon size is just H-1, the vacuum energy is the only contribution to the energy of spacetime. Since matter does not exist, black hole is not produced as r1 = 0 indicates. When we add matter to this background, its backreaction results in the deformation of the cosmological horizon down to some value smaller than H-1 and the geometry is no longer perfect dS. If matter forms black hole, the new cosmological horizon size will be r2.
For the EFT for matter in (quasi-)dS background to be valid without producing black hole, matter is required to be distributed over the region of the size L larger than r1, the radius of black hole whose mass is given by the corresponding energy. The conjecture in [19] quantifies this condition by f (L) > 0, or

r1() < L < r2(),

(10)

where the energy is contained in  through (8). We note that r2, the cosmological horizon determined by black hole, behaves like the upper bound of the cosmological horizon for a fixed M . This may be justified from the fact that given M , black hole has the highest energy concentration. Then we expect that the components of the energy-momentum tensor decay quickly as we move away from the black hole horizon and their values around the cosmological horizon is small compared to those of other form of the matter distribution. This results in the small local backreaction on the horizon. 1 Another way to see

1 Unlike the black hole horizon, the (quasi-)dS cosmological horizon (in the absence of black hole) is an observer dependent object. Even in this case, if the (quasi-)dS geometry is deformed, any observer must find the local backreaction of the energymomentum tensor on the horizon (see, e.g., [27]). Of course, in the presence of black hole, the cosmological horizon becomes observer-independent, as it is defined by the distance from the black hole center.

this is to consider the case of GM H 1, in which r2 is very close to H-1. Suppose that matter is distributed almost homogeneously inside the horizon. If such a homogeneous distribution extends beyond r2 to reach H-1, the energy density of matter is indistinguishable from that of the vacuum energy. Then the region inside H-1 keeps expanding exponentially, which is contradict to our expectation, the contraction of the cosmological horizon by the gravitational attraction of matter. If the fluctuation of the matter distribution is sufficiently small, in the absence of the dimensionful parameter comparable to H, the mean energy is the same as that in the homogeneous case up to some constant, giving the similar result. This indeed is the way to treat the cosmological perturbations over the almost homogeneous and isotropic mean energy distribution. This issue will be visited in the next section, in which we find that the condition L < r2 excludes the eternally inflating spacetime, supporting the argument above.

DEFORMATION OF DS SPACE

As we discussed in the previous section, the dS CKN bound describes the deformation (more precisely, contraction) of the cosmological horizon without invalidating the EFT in the presence of matter. In this section, we combine the dS CKN bound given by (10) with the SDC such that the energy inside the cosmological horizon is increased by the increasing number of the particle species N along the inflaton trajectory. Here we use the energy density given by N T 4  N H4 as justified in the discussion around (5).
For the clear interpretation, we take the limit GM H 1 of (10). This obviously includes the flat space limit in which the cosmological horizon is much larger than the black hole size, but also describes the small deformation of the cosmological horizon by the small amount of matter. Expanding  defined in (8) around /2, one finds that

r1 2GM, r2 H-1 - GM

(11)

for GM H 1. Therefore, the dS CKN bound (10) reads

L1 GM < min , - L .

(12)

2H

This shows that GM is bounded by L/2 for L < (2/3)H-1 which includes the flat space limit and by H-1 - L for L > (2/3)H-1, which describes the small
deformation of the cosmological horizon, respectively. In any case, the bound on GM is smaller than (3H)-1, hence by setting M = N H4L3 we expect the naive bound

N

MP2l 3H 5 L3

.

(13)

4

Then for (2/3)H-1 L H, i.e., when L is very close to the dS horizon, we obtain the bound (4) with the help of (3). However, this estimation lacks the shrinking bound on M in the perfect dS limit L H-1, in which case the upper bound on M vanishes. Therefore, we concentrate on the explicit bound given by (12).
Before discussing the deformation of the cosmological horizon, we briefly address the case of L < (2/3)H-1. This includes the flat space limit, in which the energy M = N H4L3 is distributed over the deep inside the cosmological horizon. Then the bound GM < L/2 gives

N

(14)

which is trivially satisfied for L < (2/3)H-1 since the SDC imposes

(15)

Now we move onto the case of L > (2/3)H-1, in which L is very close to H-1. The dS CKN bound in this case can be combined with the SDC by considering the matter production in quasi-dS space induced by the excursion of  as well as the interaction between matter and the background. As  moves, N is drastically increased by the descent of a tower of states. As the backreaction of the produced matter on the background deforms the cosmological horizon, matter is distributed inside the new cosmological horizon of the size L which is slightly smaller than H-1. The dS CKN bound imposes that L is smaller than r2, the size of the cosmological horizon when the produced matter forms black hole.
At the early stage of the matter production, its contribution to the energy density is much smaller than the vacuum energy density [3/(8)](HMPl)2 thus the total energy M is much smaller than (GH)-1 = (HMPl)2H-3. Meanwhile, we can parametrize the dS CKN bound H-1 - L for L smaller than but close to H-1 in terms of  and the slow roll parameters. Before proceeding further, we comment on the time coordinate we use. The constant dS cosmological horizon size H-1 and the slowroll parameters are defined in terms of the static coordinates (ts, rs) and the flat coordinates (t, r), respectively. These two coordinates are related by

e-Hts = e-Ht 1 - H2rs2, rs = reHt.

(16)

Then we find that at fixed rs, say, rs = H-1(1 - ) with a constant , we have ts = t - log(2)/2 thus dts = dt. This indicates that so far as we are interested in the fixed
rs, dt and dts can be used interchangeably. From the expression for the slow roll parameter ,

H 4 2 = -H2 = H2 ,

(17)

one obtains

dH



= -H 4 .

(18)

d

Treating as almost constant, L induced by the change in  is given by
 L = H-1 1 - 4  = H-1 1 - Ht , (19)

where for the last equality, the relation  =  t = [ /(4)]1/2Ht is used (see (17)). Since GM = N H4L3/MP2l N (H/MP2l) the dS CKN bound GM < H-1 - L is written as

t.

(20)

To see the physical meaning of this SDC-assisted dS CKN bound, we assume 1 such that L is still close to H-1 after a single e-fold, Ht  1. This means that t  H-1 can be regarded as the early stage of the matter production, i.e.,  1 thus UV degrees of freedom do not descend below H yet and N  O(1). Then (20) provides the bound on ,

H2 MP2l .

(21)

This is nothing more than the condition that the eternal inflation does not take place [28­32] (see also [33]). 2 The eternal inflation occurs when the cosmological fluctuations, the wavelength of which is stretched beyond the cosmological horizon (thus the low energy degrees of freedom below H), enhance the probability that the inflaton does not roll down its potential. Recalling the discussion at the end of previous section, one finds the dS CKN bound L < r2 imposes that the descent of states claimed by the SDC induces the contraction of the horizon by their gravitational attraction, so it is natural that the eternal inflation is not favored.
As  keeps moving on, the number of low energy degrees of freedom exponentially increases. This results in the increase in M toward (33/2GH)-1 such that  gets close to . Around  = ,the matter distribution must satisfy both L (1/ 3)H-1 and GM = (1/33/2)H-1. From M = N H4L3 N H we find that N (MPl/H)2, which is close to the saturation of the bound (4), and [11] claims that the dSC imposes that becomes O(1). More concretely, once the bound N  (MPl/H)2 is saturated, the horizon is strongly deformed not to violate the bound. This is achieved

2 For recent discussions along the line of this article are given in, for example, [34, 35]. If the universe is in the quantum mechanically excited state, the eternal inflation may take place for larger than the integer multiples of H2/MP2l [36].

5

when the rate of change in N is still smaller than that of (MPl/H)2, i.e., (dN /d) (-2H /H3)MP2l. Since dN /d = (2/3)N = (2/3)(MPl/H)2 at the satura-
tion, from (17) we obtain (see also [14])

2 .

(22)

36

Furthermore, the refined dSC [9­11] imposes another condition /(H )  O(1) for 1. If it were the case, even if 0 at some moment, it soon increases as  moves. This in fact can be frequently found in the supergravity models of the inflation, which is known as the eta problem [37].

CONCLUSION
So far, we have discussed the implications of the CKN bound when we take the SDC into account. In quasi-dS space, the exponential descent of the low energy degrees of freedom as conjectured by the SDC leads to the rapid increase in the energy inside the cosmological horizon. The dS CKN bound states that for the EFT not to be spoiled by the production of black hole, matter must be distributed between the black hole radius and the cosmological horizon determined by black hole of the same energy. By identifying the maximal size of the matter distribution with the cosmological horizon deformed by the production of matter, we find that the SDC-assisted dS CKN bound forbids the eternal inflation. Our discussion is supplement to the entropy argument supporting the dSC, as it enables us to investigate more detailed dynamics of the contracting cosmological horizon.
Meanwhile, the SDC seems to be consistent with other swampland conjectures, such as the weak gravity conjecture [38]. The weak gravity conjecture quantifies the quantum gravity obstruction to restoring a global symmetry by taking vanishing limit of the unbroken U(1) gauge coupling (for a recent discussion relevant to the CKN bound, see, e.g., [39]). The correlation between the WGC and the SDC can be found from, for example, the restoration of the global shift symmetry in the limit of infinite field value of the modulus, where nonperturbative effects become suppressed [20, 40­43]. The SDC claims that this can be prevented by cut off  at the Planckian value. The quantum gravity implications of the connection between the SDC, the dSC, the weak gravity conjecture and the CKN bound will be a subject of further investigation.
