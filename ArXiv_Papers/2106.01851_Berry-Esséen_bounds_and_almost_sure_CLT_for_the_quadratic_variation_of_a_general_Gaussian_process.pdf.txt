BERRY-ESSÉEN BOUNDS AND ALMOST SURE CLT FOR THE QUADRATIC VARIATION OF A GENERAL GAUSSIAN PROCESS

YONG CHEN, ZHEN DING, AND YING LI

Abstract. In this paper, we consider the explicit bound for the second-order

approximation of the quadratic variation of a general fractional Gaussian process

(Gt)t0. The second order mixed partial derivative of the covariance function

R(t, s) = E[GtGs] can be decomposed into two parts, one of which coincides with

that of fractional Brownian motion and the other of which is bounded by (ts)H-1

up to a constant factor. This condition is valid for a class of continuous Gauss-

ian processes that fails to be self-similar or have stationary increments. Under

this

assumption,

we

obtain

the

optimal

Berry-Esséen

bounds

when

H



(0,

2 3

]

and

the

upper

Berry-Esséen

bounds

when

H



(

,

3 4

].

As

a

by-product,

we

also

show the almost sure central limit theorem (ASCLT) for the quadratic variation

when

H

 (0,

3 4

].

The

results

extend

that

of

[10]

to

the

case

of

general

Gauss-

ian processes, unify and improve the Berry-Esséen bounds in [14], [1] and [7]

for respectively the sub-fractional Brownian motion, the bi-fractional Brownian

motion and the sub-bifractional Brownian motion.

1. Introduction

We are interested in the explicit bound for the second-order approximation of the quadratic variation of a general fractional Gaussian process G = {Gt : t  0} on [0, T ], defined as

n-1

Zn :=

(G(k+1) - Gk)2 - E[(Gk+1 - Gk)2] .

k=0

Let the renormalization of Zn be

Vn

:=

1 n Zn,

(1.1)

2

Y. CHEN, Z. DING, AND Y. LI

where n > 0 is so that E[Vn2] = 1, i.e., n2 := E[Zn2]. When G is the fractional Brownian motion BH , by using Stein method and
Malliavin calculus, Nourdin and Peccati [9, 10] derived explicit bounds for the total variation distance between the law of Vn and the standard normal law N. From then on, the same problem was extended to some other fractional Gaussian processes such as the sub-fractional Brownian motion, the bi-fractional Brownian motion and the sub-bifractional Brownian motion in [14], [1] and [7] respectively.
We find that the above four types of fractional Gaussian processes are all special examples of the following general Gaussian process G. Let

RB(s, t)

=

1 2

(|s|2H

+ |t|2H

- |t

-

s|2H ),

(1.2)

be the covariance function of the fractional Brownian motion {BH(t), t  0}.

HYPOTHESIS 1.1. For H  (0, 1), the covariance function R(t, s) = E[GtGs] satisfies that

(1) for any s  0, R(0, s) = 0.

(2) for any fixed s  [0, T ], R(t, s) is continuous on [0, T ] and is a differentiable

function

with

respect

to

t

in

(0, s)  (s, T ),

such

that

 t

R(t,

s)

is

absolutely

integrable.

(3) for any fixed t  (0, T ), the difference

R(t, s) - RB(t, s)

t

t

is continuous on [0, T ], and it is differentiable with respect to s in (0, T ) such that (t, s), the partial derivative with respect to s of the difference, satisfies

|(t, s)|  CH |ts|H-1,

(1.3)

where the constants H,CH  0 do not depend on T, and RB(t, s) is the covariance function of the fractional Brownian motion as in (1.2).

Example 1.2. The subfractional Brownian motion {SH(t), t  0} with parameter H  (0, 1) has the covariance function

R(t,

s)

=

s2H

+

t2H

-

1 2

(s + t)2H + |t - s|2H

,

which satisfies Hypothesis 1.1.

BERRY-ESSÉEN BOUNDS AND ASCLT FOR QUADRATIC VARIATION OF GAUSSIAN PROCESSES3

Example 1.3. The bi-fractional Brownian motion {BH,K(t), t  0} with param-

eters H, K  (0, 1) has the covariance function

R(t,

s)

=

1 2

(s2H + t2H )K - |t - s|2HK

,

which satisfies Hypothesis 1.1 when H := HK.

Example 1.4. The generalized sub-fractional Brownian motion SH,K(t) with parameters H  (0, 1), K  [1, 2) and HK  (0, 1) satisfies Hypothesis 1.1 when H := HK. The covariance function is
R(t, s) = (s2H + t2H )K - 1 (t + s)2HK + |t - s|2HK . 2
Notation 1. Given two deterministic numeric sequences (an)n0,(bn)n0, we use the following notations and definitions for respectively commensurability, equivalence:

an  bn  c, C > 0 : cbn  an  Cbn, for n large enough,

an  bn  cn, Cn > 0 : lim cn = lim Cn = 1, cnbn  an  Cnbn, for n large enough.

Now we list our main results as follows:

Remark 1.6. (1) The above Berry-Esséen types bounds are sharper than those

obtained in [14], [1] and [7] for respectively the sub-fractional Brownian mo-

tion, the bi-fractional Brownian motion and the sub-bifractional Brownian

motion.

(3) In the same vein, we can also extend Theorem 1.5 to the pth Hermite variation with p > 2.

As a by-product of Theorem 1.5, we have the ASCLT of the sequence (Vn)n1.

Theorem

1.7.

If

then

the

2. Preliminary
In this section, we describe some basic facts on stochastic calculus with respect to the Gaussian process, for more complete presentation on the subject can be found in [6].
Denote G = {Gt, t  [0, T ]} as a continuous centered Gaussian process with G0 = 0 and the covariance function

E(GtGs) = R(s, t), s, t  [0, T ],

(2.1)

defined on a complete probability space(, F , P ), where the F is generated by the Gaussian family G. Suppose in addition that the covariance function R is continuous. Let E denote the space of all real valued step functions on [0, T ]. The Hilbert space H is defined as the closure of E endowed with the inner product

½ ½ [a,b), [c,d) H = E((Gb - Ga)(Gd - Gc)),

(2.2)

where ½[a,b) is the indicator function of the interval [a, b). With abuse of notation,
we also denote G = {Gh, h  H} as the isonormal Gaussian process on the probability space, indexed by the elements in the Hilbert space H. Then G is a Gaussian family of random variables such that

E(G) = E(G(h)) = 0, E(GgGh) = g, h H, g, h  H.

(2.3)

Notation 2. Let RB(t, s) be the covariance function of the fractional Brownian motion as in (1.2). Denote V[0,T ] as the set of bounded variation functions on [0, T ].

BERRY-ESSÉEN BOUNDS AND ASCLT FOR QUADRATIC VARIATION OF GAUSSIAN PROCESSES5

For functions f, g  V[0,T ], we define two products as

 RB (t, t

f, g H2 = CH

[0,T ]2

(2.4)

The following proposition is an extension of Theorem 2.3 of [6], which gives the inner products representation of the Hilbert space H:

Proposition 2.1. V[0,T ] in dense in H and we have

f, g H =

R(t, s)f (dt)g(ds),

[0,T ]2

f, g  V[0,T ],

(2.5)

where g is the restriction to ([0, T ], B([0, T ])) of the Lebesgue-Stieljes signed measure associated with g0 defined as

g0(x) = g(x), 0,

if x  [0, T ]. otherwise .

Furthermore, if the covariance function R(t, s) satisfies Hypothesis 1.1, then

f, g H = -

[0,T

]2

f

(t)

R(t, t

s)

dtg

(ds),

f, g  V[0,T ].

(2.6)

In particular, we have

| f, g H - f, g H1|  f, g H2,

f, g  V[0,T ].

(2.7)

Remark

2.2.

When

H



(

1 2

,

1),

the

identity

(2.6)

can

be

rewritten

as

f, g H =

f (t)g(s) 2R(t, s) dtds,

[0,T ]2

ts

f, g  V[0,T ].

(2.8)

In

this

case,

the

inequality

(2.7)

has

obtained

from

(2.8)

in

[4].

When

H



(0,

1 2

),

it

is

well

known

that

both

2 ts

R(t,

s)

and

2 ts

RB

(t,

s)

are

not

absolutely

integrable.

But their difference is absolutely integrable, which makes the key inequality (2.7)

still valid.

Proof. The first claim and the identity (2.5) are rephrased from Theorem 2.3 of [6]. Hypothesis 1.1 (2) and Lemma 3.1 implies the second inner products representation (2.6) holds.

6

Y. CHEN, Z. DING, AND Y. LI

Finally, it follows from the identity (2.6) and Notation 2 that

f, g H1 - f, g H =

f (t)
[0,T ]2

R(t, s) - RB(t, s)

t

t

dtg (ds).

By the fundamental theorem of calculus (see Proposition 1.6.41 of [13]), Hypothesis 1.1 (1) and (3) imply that when s = t,

R(t, s) - RB(t, s) =

s
(t, r)dr.

t

Hence, Lemma 3.1 implies that

(2.9)

f, g H -

f, g H1 = -

R(t, s) - RB(t, s)

g (ds)

= f (t)dt g(s)(t, s)ds,

[0,T ]

[0,T ]

which implies the inequality (2.7) since (t, s) satisfies the inequality (1.3).

Denote Hp and Hp as the pth tensor product and the pth symmetric tensor

product of the Hilbert space H. Let Hp be the pth Wiener chaos with respect to G. It is defined as the closed linear subspace of L2() generated by the random

variables {Hp(G(h)) : h  H, h H = 1}, where Hp is the pth Hermite polynomial

defined by

Hp(x)

and H0(x) = 1. We have the identity Ip(hp) = Hp(G(h)) for any h  H with

h H = 1 where provides a linear

the map Ip · ) Hp and

Hp. Here H0 = R and I0(x) = x by convention.

The following Theorem 2.3, known as the optimal fourth moment theorem,

provides exact rates of convergence in total variation distance between a multiple

Wiener-Itô integral and a normal distribution (see [12, 3]).

Theorem 2.3. Let N  N(0, 1) be a standard Gaussian random variable. Let {Fn : n  1} be a sequence of random variables living in the pth multiple WienerItô integral with unit variance. If limn E[Fn4] = 3, then there exist two finite constants 0 < c < C (possibly depending on p and on the sequence {Fn}, but not on n) such that the following estimate in total variation holds for every n:

cM(Fn)  dT V (Fn, N )  CM(Fn),

BERRY-ESSÉEN BOUNDS AND ASCLT FOR QUADRATIC VARIATION OF GAUSSIAN PROCESSES7

where

M(Fn) := max E[Fn3] , E[Fn4 - 3] .

The quantities 3(Fn) := E(Fn3) and 4(Fn) := E[Fn4] - 3 are called the 3rd and 4th cumulants of Fn. That 3(Fn) coincides with the third moment is because Fn is centered. Moreover, 4(Fn) is strictly positive (see [11, 8] ).
The following theorem is used to show the ASCLT.

Theorem 2.4 ([2]). Let p  2 be an integer, and let Fn = Iq(fn), with fn  Hp. Assume that for all n, and that Fn law N (0, 1) as n  . If the two following
conditions are satisfied

3. proof of Theorems 1.5 and 1.7.

We

will

discuss

exclusively

the

case

H

=

1 2

since

the

case

H

=

1 2

is

easy.

First,

we need two technical lemmas.

Lemma 3.1. Let [a, b] be a compact interval of positive length, let  : [a, b]  R be continuous on [a, b] and differentiable in (a, b), such that  is absolutely integrable. For any f  V[a,b], we have

- f (t)(t)dt = (t)f (dt),

[a,b]

[a,b]

where f is given as in Proposition 2.1.

(3.1)

Proof. The proof is similar to that of [5, Proposition 2.2]. We establish this in stages. We first deal with the case when f is a step functions on [0, T ] of the form

N -1

f=

fj 1[tj ,tj+1),

j=0

where {a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tN = b} is a partition of [0, T ] and fj  R. The corresponding signed measure is

N -1
f = (fj - fj-1)tj + f (a+)0 - f (b-)T .
j=1

By the fundamental theorem of calculus again, the assumption of  implies that

(t)dt = (tj+1) - (tj).
[tj , tj+1)

BERRY-ESSÉEN BOUNDS AND ASCLT FOR QUADRATIC VARIATION OF GAUSSIAN PROCESSES9

Hence, the following formula of integrations by parts hold:

N -1

- f (t)(t)dt = fj (tj) - (tj+1)

[a,b]

j=0

N -1
= (fj - fj-1)(tj) + f0(t0) - fN-1(tN )
j=1

= (t)f (dt).
[a,b]

(3.2)

Now we assume that f is a right continuous monotone non-decreasing function
on [0, T ]. For any sequence partitions n = a = tn0 < tn1 < · · · < tnkn = b such that n  n+1 and |n|  0 as n  , consider

kn-1

fn =

f (tnj )1[tnj ,tnj+1).

j=0

It is clear that the sequence of signed measures fn converges weakly to f . Lebesgue's dominated theorem implies that

(t)f (dt) = lim

[a,b]

n

(t)fn (dt)
[a,b]

= - lim n

fn(t)(t)dt
[a,b]

(by (3.2).)

= - f (t)(t)dt.
[a,b]

Finally, it is well known that every function of bounded variation is the difference of two bounded monotone non-decreasing function and that the value of f at its points of discontinuity are irrelevant for the purposes of determining the LebesgueStieltjes measure f [13]. Hence, (3.1) is valid for any f  V[a,b].

Lemma 3.2. Let v1, · · · , vl be positive. There is a positive constant c depending on v1, · · · , vl such that when r  N := {1, 2, · · · } is large enough,

riN,

r1v1-1r2v2-1 · · · rlvl-1  c × r

l i=1

ri<r

. l

(3.3)

Remark 3.3. When v1, · · · , vl are negative, the following inequality is trivial: there is a positive constant c depending on v1, · · · , vl such that when r  N is large

10

Y. CHEN, Z. DING, AND Y. LI

enough,

r1v1-1r2v2-1 · · · rlvl-1  c < .

riN,

l i=1

ri<r

(3.4)

Proof. Let v0 > 0. It is well-known that on the standard simplex in Rl:

l
T l := (x1, · · · , xl) : xi  0, xi  1 ,
i=1

the following integral converges:

Tl

x1v1-1x2v2-1

· · · xlvl-1(1

-

x1

-

···

-

=

li=0(vi)

(

l i=0

where (·) the Gamma function.The change of variables implies that there is a

positive constant c depending on v0, v1, · · · , vl such that when r  N is large enough,

r1v1-1r2v2-1 · · · rlvl-1(r - r1 - · · · - rl)v0-1  c × r-1+

. l
i=0

vi

riN,

l i=1

ri<r

Especially, when v0 = 1, the above inequality collapses to (3.3).

Without any loss of generality, we suppose for simplicity that CH = 1 in this section. Denote

(i, j) := E Gi+1 - Gi Gj+1 - Gj , (i, j) := (i, j) - (i - j).

(3.5)

Proposition 3.4. Under Hypothesis 1.1, there exists a positive constant c such that for any n  1,

1 n-1 (i, j)2  c × n(4H-3)(-1). n
i,j=0

Proof. It is clear that we need only show the inequality (3.6) holds. It follows (2.2), the definition of the inner product, that

(i, j) = E Gi+1 - Gi Gj+1 - Gj ½ ½ = [i,i+1), [j,j+1) H,
and
(i - j) = E BiH+1 - BiH BjH+1 - BjH ½ ½ = [i,i+1), [j,j+1) H1 ,
where BH is the fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index H. The inequality (2.7) implies that

It is clear that the function f (u) = (1+u)H in u  [0, ) is concave, i.e., f (u)  0, which implies that for any u  0, (1 + u)H  1 + Hu. Hence, for any i  1,

(i + 1)H - iH = iH (1 + 1 )H - 1  H × iH-1. i

where in the last line we have used Propositions 2.5 and 3.4. By plugging this

limit into the identity (3.16) and using Propositions 2.5 and 3.4 again, we obtain

the desired limit (3.11).

In the similar vein, the desired limit (3.12) holds.

Proposition 3.6. Let (i, j), (i, j), (r) be given as in (3.5). When H  (0, 1), there exists a positive constant c such that for all n  1

n-1
(j, k)(k, l)(j, l)  c × n(6H-3)0,

In the above summation, when j = l, it is clear that

(j + 1)H - jH (l + 1)H - lH |(j - l)| =

(j + 1)H - jH 2  cn(2H-1)0.

When j = 0 < l, we have

where in the last line we use Lemma 6.3 of [9]. The symmetry, the inequality (3.9), the monotonicity of the power function f (x) = x with x > 0,  < 0, and the change of variable k = l - j imply that the other terms are less than:

Finally, we have

In the similar vein, we have that in the summation the contribution of all the terms such that j = k or k = l or j = l or j = 0 or k = 0 or l = 0 are negligible to compare with n(6H-3)0. The symmetry implies that other terms are less than:

According to the distinct orders of j, k, l, we do the change of variables a = j, k - j = b, l - k = c when 0 < j < k < l, or a = j, l - j = b, k - l = c when 0 < j < l < k, or a = l, j - l = b, k - j = c when 0 < l < j < k, and then by the monotonicity of the power function again, we have

In the same way, we can show the following proposition.

It is easy to show that when any two index of i, j, k, l are equal or any index vanishes, the contribution to the sum are negligible to compare with n(8H-4)0. The symmetry implies that other terms is less than

According to the distinct orders of i, j, k, l, we do the change of variables a = i, j - i = b, k - j = c, l - k = d when 0 < i < j < k < l, or a = i, k - i = b, j - k = c, l - j = d when 0 < i < k < j < l, or a = j, k - i = b, l - k = c, j - l = d when 0 < i < k < j < l, or a = k, i - k = b, j - i = c, l - j = d when 0 < k < i < j < l, or or a = k, i - k = b, l - i = c, j - l = d when 0 < k < i < j < l, or a = k, l - k = b, i - l = c, j - i = d when 0 < k < i < j < l, and then by the monotonicity of the power function again, we have

Recall (3.13) and (3.14), the expressions of Zn and gn.

Denote

Combing (3.26)-(3.31) with Theorem 2.3 and Propositions 2.6, 3.5, we obtain the

desired result since

4(Vn)

Proof of Theorem 1.7. From Theorem 1.5, Vn satisfies the CLT. Hence, we need

only to check the conditions (1) and (2) of Theorem 2.4 are valid. We will discuss

exclusively

the

case

H

since

the

case

is

similar.

Recall Vn = I2(fn) where

Hence, the condition (1) of Theorem 2.4 is valid.

To check the condition (2) of Theorem 2.4, first noting that E[Vn2] = 2

fn
