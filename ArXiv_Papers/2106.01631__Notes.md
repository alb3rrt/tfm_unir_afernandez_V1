## Abstract

We numerically investigate the emission of terahertz (THz) spin waves from a moving antiferromagnetic (AFM) domain wall (DW) under the magnetic anisotropy energy gradient (dEa/dx). Unlike the spin-wave emission from a spin-orbit-torque driven AFM DW motion, the dEa/dx-induced spin-wave emission originates from the DW acceleration instead of the Lorentz contraction. The DW acceleration effectuates a strong DW precession at the moderate exchange integral. When the DW precession frequency is greater than the frequency gap of spin waves in the AFM medium, a continuous THz spin wave is resonantly emitted. Because dEa/dx can be readily generated under a DC voltage, our work provides a feasible approach for the development of on-chip THz spintronic devices with low dissipations.
