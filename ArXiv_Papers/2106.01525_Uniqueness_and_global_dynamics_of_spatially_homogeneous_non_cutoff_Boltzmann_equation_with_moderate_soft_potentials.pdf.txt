UNIQUENESS AND GLOBAL DYNAMICS OF SPATIALLY HOMOGENEOUS NON CUTOFF BOLTZMANN EQUATION

LING-BING HE AND JIE JI
Abstract. Departing from the weak solution, we prove the uniqueness, smoothing estimates and the global dynamics for the non cutoff spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation with moderate soft potentials. Our results show that the behavior of the solution(including the production of regularity and the longtime behavior) can be characterized quantitatively by the initial data at the large velocities, i.e.(i). initially polynomial decay at the large velocities in L1 space will induce the finite smoothing estimates in weighted Sobolev spaces and the polynomial convergence rate (including the lower and upper bounds) to the equilibrium; (ii). initially the exponential decay at the large velocities in L1 space will induce C regularization effect and the stretched exponential convergence rate. The new ingredients of the proof lie in the development of the localized techniques in phase and frequency spaces and the propagation of the exponential momentum.

1. Introduction

We focus on the uniqueness and global dynamics for the non cutoff spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation with moderate soft potentials. The equation reads as follows:

(1.1)

tf = Q(f, f ),

where f (t, v)  0 is a distribution function of collision particles which at time t > 0 move with velocity v  R3. The Boltzmann collision operator Q is a bilinear operator which acts on the velocity variable v,
that is

Q(g, f ) =

B(v - v, )(g f  - gf )ddv.

R3 S2

Let us give some explanations on the collision operator.

(1) We use the standard shorthand f = f (v), g = g(v), f  = f (v), g = g(v ), where v, v are given by

v =

v + v 2

+

|v

- 2

v| ,

v =

v + v 2

-

|v

- 2

v|

,

  S2.

This representation is consistent with the physical laws of the elastic collision:

v + v = v + v , |v|2 + |v|2 = |v|2 + |v |2.

(2) The nonnegative function B(v - v, ) in the collision operator is called the Boltzmann collision

kernel. It is always assumed to depend only on |v - v| and the deviation angle  through cos  d=ef

v-v |v-v |

и

.

(3) In the present work, our basic assumptions on the kernel B can be concluded as follows:

The Boltzmann kernel B

takes the form:

B(v

),

where b

is a

nonnegative function.

(A2). The angular function b(t) is not locally integrable and it satisfies

K-1-2s  sin b(cos )  K-1-1-2s, with 0 < s < 1, K > 0.

(A3). The parameter  and s satisfy the condition: -2s   < 0.

(A4). Without lose of generality, we may assume that B(v-v, ) is supported in the set 0    /2,

i.e.

v-v |v-v

where 1A is the characteristic function of the set A.

Remark 1.1. For the inverse power law interactions, the parameters  and s verifies  + 4s = 1. In this situation, the assumption (A3) is equivalent to the condition s  1/2.

1.1. Basic properties and the weak formula of the equation. We recall some basic facts on the homogeneous equation. и Conservation Law. Formally if f is the solution to Eq. (1.1) with the initial data f0, then it enjoys the conservation of mass, momentum and the energy, that is,
d f (t, v)(v)dv = 0, (v) = 1, v, |v|2. dt R3
For simplicity, we introduce the normalization identities on the initial data f0 which verifies

(1.2)

f0(v) dv = 1,

f0(v) v dv = 0,

f0(v) |v|2 dv = 3.

R3

R3

This implies that the equilibrium associated to (1.2) will be the standard Gaussian function, i.e.

(1.3)

M (v) d=ef (2)-3/2e-|v|2/2,

which enjoys the same mass, momentum and energy as f0. и H-Theorem. If the entropy H(f ) is defined by

H(f (t)) d=ef f log f dv,
R3

then the celebrated H-theorem predicts that the entropy is decreasing over time, which formally is

Instead of the entropy, in this context, we shall use the relative entropy

(1.4)

H(f |M )(t) d=ef (f (t) log(f (t)/M ) - f (t) + M )dv.

In this way, the above equality can be rewritten as

и Weak formula of the equation. Next we introduce the definition of the weak solution.

Definition 1.1 (Weak solution of Boltzmann equation without angular cutoff). Let f0 be a non-negative
function satisfying (1.2). Under the assumptions (A1)-(A4) , we say that a non-negative measurable
function f (t, v)  L([0, ), L12  L log L) is a weak solution of Eq. (1.1) if f satisfies the following (i), (ii): (i) f conserves the mass, momentum, and energy, and satisfies the entropy inequality

t
H(f (t)) + D(f (s))ds  H(f0), t  0.
0
(ii) For any   Cc2(R3), the function t  R3 (v)f (t, v)dv is absolutely continuous on [0, ) and the differential equality holds for almost every T  [0, ).

Remark 1.2. The collision operator Q is defined in the principal value sense through the deviation angle (see the righthand side of (1.6)). This is crucial in particular for the high singularity case s  1/2(see [16] for more details).

Remark 1.3. The existence of the weak solution was proved in [26]. We also remark that (1.6) can also be replaced by the following formula, that is, for (t, v)  C1([0, ]; Cc2(R3)) and T  0,

1.2. Brief review of previous results. Since the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation without angular cutoff had been widely investigated, in what follows, we will only mention those works which are related closely to ours. We emphasize that all the results reviewed in the below hold for the kernel satisfying (A1)-(A4) .

и Uniqueness result. In [10, 11], by using Wasserstein distance, authors proved the conditional uniqueness of the weak solution defined in Definition 1.1. More precisely,

Theorem 1.1 (Conditional uniqueness(see Cor 1.5 in [11])). Assume that the kernel verifies (A1)-(A4)

and

let

and

).

The

weak

solution

f (t, v)

defined

in

Definition

1.1

is

unique

if

it

satisfies that f  L1loc([0, ], Lp(R3)).

и Regularization and the pointwise lower bound for the solution. If we additional assume that the solution has the infinite moments, then in [2, 7] authors proved the smoothing estimates for the weak solution for any positive time. For the inhomogeneous equation, we refer readers to very recent work [19] on the De Giorgi method to get the smoothing effect under the sole assumption that hydrodynamic quantities (local mass, local energy and local entropy density) remain bounded. We finally remark that the disadvantage of these methods lies in the fact that we cannot quantify the dependence of the smoothing estimates on the initially L1 moment.
With the same assumption, in [18], the authors prove the Gaussian lower bounds for the solution to the Boltzmann equation without angular cutoff. Roughly speaking, they proved that there exist two timedependent functions a(t) and b(t) such that
f (t)  a(t)e-b(t)|v|2 .

This improved the previous results obtained in [21, 22]. Noting that in reality, for soft potentials, it is not clear whether hydrodynamic quantities can remain bounded for all time. Motivated by this, in the paper [15], authors gave quantitative estimates for the pointwise lower bound of the solution under the assumptions that the Sobolev regularity grows tempered with time. More precisely,

Theorem 1.2 ([15]). Suppose the kernel B verifying (A1)-(A4) and let f (t) be a classical solution to

Eq.(1.1) with the initial data f0 satisfying (1.2). If additionally,

|f (t)|Lp + |f (t)|W 2,  A(1 + t),

t  (, ).

Remark 1.4. This is an intermediate result but it is crucial to implement the idea that the entropy dissipation will prevail the slow growth of the Sobolev regularity and then induces the convergence of the solution to the equilibrium.

и Propagation of moment and longtime behavior. In recent work [17], for the classical solution the authors proved that the pointwise moment, that is, |f (t)|L q , can be propagated uniformly in time via using barrier method if q  q0. This is the first uniform estimates for the soft potentials. Unfortunately because

4

L. -B. HE AND J. JI

of the contradiction argument, it is hard to compute q0 explicitly from the proof. It more or less indicates that the quantitative estimates on the global dynamics is still unclear.
We finally address the result on the propagation of L1 moment which was proved in [5]. We shall use it
to get the global dynamics.

Proposition 1.1 (see [5]). Assume that the kernel verifies (A1)-(A4) . The weak solution satisfies that if f0  L1l , then

(1.8)

|f (t)|L1l  C(l)(1 + t), t  R+.

1.3. Main results. Our main purpose of the paper is to give affirmative answers to the uniqueness and
the quantitative estimates on the global dynamics for the weak solution to the spatially homogeneous non
cutoff Boltzmann equation. Let us first introduce the function spaces and notations. и For any p  [1, +), q  R the Lpq norm is defined by

|f |pLpq =

|f (v)|p v pq dv,
R3

where the Japanese bracket v is defined as v d=ef (1 + |v|2)1/2. и The general weighted Sobolev space WlN,p with p  [1, ) is defined as

WlN,p d=ef {f (v)||f |WlN,p =

(

v

)

1 p

< },

where the multi-index  = (1, 2, 3) with || = 1 + 2 + 3 and v = v11 v22 v22 .
и The L log L space is defined by the identities |f |L log L d=ef R3 |f log f |dv. и The L1s log L space is defined as

L1s log L d=ef {f (v)||f |L1s log L =

|f | v s(1 + | log f |)dv < }.
R3

и For any integer N > 0, we define the Sobolev space HN by

HN d=ef {f (v)|

|vf |L2 < +}.

||N

и For real numbers m, p, we define the weighted Sobolev space Hpm by

Hpm d=ef {f (v)||f |Hpm = | D m и pf |L2 < +}, where a(D) is a pseudo-differential operator with the symbol a() and it is defined as

(a(D)f )(x)

d=ef

R3

ei(x-y)a()f (y)dyd.
R3

и We write a b(a b) indicate that there is a uniform constant C, which may be different on different
lines, such that a  Cb(a  Cb). We use the notation a  b whenever a b and b a. We write a▒ indicate a ▒ , where  > 0 is sufficiently small. The notation a+ means the maximum value of a and 0 and
[a] denotes the maximum integer which does not exceed a. We denote Ca1,a2,иии ,an by a constant depending on parameters a1, a2, и и и , an.

We begin with the uniqueness result.
Theorem 1.3 (Uniqueness). Suppose  + 2s > 0 and 0 <   1. Let f (t) be a weak solution defined in (1.1). Then the weak solution is unique if the parameters  and s fulfill the following condition:
max{-3/2, -2s} <  < min{-4s2 - 4s + 7, 0}.
For the other cases, the weak solution is unique if f0  L1max{/2+(2s-1)(3s+2),2}.
Remark 1.5. According to the statement, f0  L13 is enough to get the uniqueness for the moderate soft potentials. Since our result is based on Theorem 1.1(conditional uniqueness), we have no idea how to generalize the result to the borderline case  = -2s.

regarded as a universal constant which is not big.

и For m, p  0, we introduce a function such that

C(m, p) := max{m + p + C2,s,K, C1,s,K }.

Obviously C(m, p) can be regarded as a linear function on m and p. We explain that this function is used as a threshold such that if the initial data satisfies that f0  L1l with l > C(m, p) then the solution f (t, v) will be in the space L([, ]; Hpm) for any  > 0.
The next two results are on the propagation of the moments and the associated global dynamics.

Several comments on the results are in order:
и Comment on quantitative estimates on the global dynamics. Our results gives the first full description on the global behavior of the relative entropy. We show that the global dynamics depends heavily on the initial data in the large velocity region. In particular our results give an affirmative answer to the conjecture that the polynomial moment only induces the polynomial convergence rate to the equilibrium(including the lower and upper bounds). However we still need another effort to clarify the following things:

6

L. -B. HE AND J. JI

(1) Due to the technical restriction, we only show that the convergence rate of the relative entropy can

be improved when l becomes larger and larger. Here l means l-th moment assumption on the initial

data. It is not clear that such phenomenon reflect the real relaxation mechanism. We are also not

sure whether these estimates are sharp.

(2) Thanks to the Csisza┤r-Kullback-Pinsker inequality, convergence rate of the relative entropy can be transformed in estimates on the L1 norm of f (t) - M . Compared to (1.15), it seems that the convergence rate in L1 space is far away from the optimal one. We conjecture that indeed the convergence rate (1 + t)l/ derived in (1.15) is sharp for the initial data with only l-th moment(i.e. f0  L1l ) because it is attained in L2 space for Landau equation(see [6]).

и Comment on smoothing estimates. In comparison with the previous work, our smoothing estimates (1.16)

and (1.17) have two advantages: (i). We show that the relationship between the production of the regu-

larization and the l-th moment assumption on the initial data is linear. (ii). We give the explicit blowup

rate when the t variable approaches the initial time. As a direct consequence, we get that the solution is in

L m+

3 2

loc

([0,

Hpm)

which

helps

to

the

in

Theorem

1.3.

и Comment on the propagation of moment. In comparison with (1.8), we prove that the l-th moment(see

(1.14)) is propagated uniformly in time if l satisfies the certain conditions. This is crucial to our next

result on the propagation of the exponential moment. We also remark that such result is comparable to the uniform-in-time L q bounds obtained in [17].

Theorem 1.5 (Exponential moment). Suppose  + 2s  0 and f (t) is a weak solution defined in (1.1). If Gb,(v)f0  L1 where

(1.18)

Gb,(v) d=ef



bj

,

j=0

b  (0, 1] and   [-/2, s], then there exists a constant a  (0, b) depending only on f0 such that
sup |Ga,f (t)|L1  C(f0),
t[0,)

which implies that

(1.19)

2
H(f |M )(t)  C(f0)e-t 4- .

и Comment on the propagation of the exponential moment. The topics on the propagation or creation of exponential moment for the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation with hard potentials and Maxwellian molecules has been widely investigated(see [3, 4, 9, 20, 24]). To our best knowledge, it is the first result on the propagation of the exponential moment for the moderate soft potentials. Compared to the previous work, we implement it by using the moment function Gb, instead of the exponential function eb|v|2 because it perfectly matches the structure of the collision(see the below for the details).
и Comment on the moment function Gb,. We first show that the moment function Gb, is equivalent to the standard exponential function. In fact, we have

Proposition 1.2. Suppose that b  (0, 1) and   [-/2, s]. Then there exists a constant C which is

universal such that

Since  < 1, then the fact [(n + 2)/] - [n/]  1 implies that

eb1/ v 2

v 2Gb,(v).

This ends the proof.

Next we interpret our motivation on the moment function. Roughly speaking, the special form of Gb, stems from the structure of the collision operator. The parameter b in (1.18) is used to control the terms from the collision operator. The restriction of parameter  in (1.18) comes from the sharp Povnzer's inequality which was observed in [16]:

Lemma 1.1. Let l  2 and E() d=ef v 2 cos2(/2) + v 2 sin2(/2). Then there exists a universal constant c1, c2 > 0 and c3 > 0 s.t.

(1.21)

(E())l/2 - v l b(cos )d  -c1ls v l + c2ls v 2 v l-2 + v 2 v l-2 + c3l-1 v l.

S2

Here we not only gain the factor v l but also gain the big coefficient ls, which fits well for the factorial term (j!)s in (1.18). Moreover, it enables to get the real damping in the proof of the propagation(see (1.22)). We
will explain in detail in the next subsection.

1.4. Strategies and ideas of the proof. In this subsection, we will explain main strategies and ideas of the proof for our results.
и Idea of the proof for uniqueness result. The proof of Theorem 1.3 is straightforward. Thanks to Theorem 1.1, we only need to show that the condition, f  L1loc([0, ]; Lp) with p > 3/( + 3), is automatically satisfied for all the weak solution. This can be done formally. Roughly speaking, from (1.1) and the standard coercivity estimates established in [14], one has

t|f |2L2

Then interpolation inequality will yield that for some  > 0,

C,

where X(t) = |f (t)|2L2. From this, we can prove that X(t) is locally integrable which is enough to conclude the uniqueness result for some range of .
Unfortunately, departing from the weak solution, we have no idea that f (t)  L2 for t  0. Therefore to
give the rigorous proof, some suitable mollifier, acting on the weak solution, becomes compulsory. However
it will induce another difficulty: the estimate of the commutator with the nonlocal collision operator. Since we only have the condition f (t, v)  L([0, ), L12 L log L), the analysis turns to be very subtle. To bypass the difficulty, we develop the localization techniques both in phase and frequency spaces. It allows us to get
the sharp bound in each dyadic annulus which is essential to our proof.

и Idea of the proof for global dynamics. The main obstacle to get the quantitative estimates for the longtime behavior results from the derivation of the bounds of the solution uniformly in time. To solve the problem, we treat the longtime behavior and the regularization effect as a whole. Motivated by [25], our strategy can be interpreted as follows:

Step 1: With the help of the localization both in phase and frequency spaces, we first prove that the growth rate of the solution f (t, v) in Hpm space can be sufficiently slow if f0  L1 with  sufficiently large.
Step 2: With the Sobolev regularity in hand, on one hand, we can apply Theorem 1.2 to get the pointwise lower bound; on the other hand, we can employee the standard entropy method to get the convergence to the equilibrium with rough convergence rate.
Step 3: Once we have the convergence rate on the longtime behavior, we can use it to improve smoothing estimates and the control of the -th moment which may hold uniformly in time. As a consequence, these in turn help us to improve the convergence rate.

и Idea of the proof for the propagation of exponential moment. To interpret our main idea, for simplicity, we assume  = s = -/2. Thanks to Lemma 1.1, it is not difficult to derive that

It is surprising that we get the full damping which is more than what we expect. More or less this property coincides with fact that for the moderate soft potentials, the linearized Boltzmann collision operator with long-range interactions does have the spectral gap.
To control the term R(b, l, f ) in the right-hand side of (1.22), the full damping in the left-hand side will play the essential role. However in practice, it is very subtle and difficult to conclude the desired result because of the following aspects:
(1). It is very complicated to distribute the factorial (l!)s inside the collision operator(i.e. the quadratic term);
(2). Since any coefficient matters in the computation, we shall take care of the integration with respect to the deviation angle and it makes the computation very tedious;

(3). The big challenge stems from the collision operator since R(b, l, f ) behaves like |Gb,sf |2L1. Since
l=0
initially |Gb,sf0|L1 is not small, it seems that this exponential moment can be propagated only locally in time.
To bypass these difficulties, we propose a strategy which can be summarized as follows. Thanks to Theorem 1.4, we know that any polynomial L1 moment is propagated uniformly in time. With this property, instead of considering |Gb,sf |L1, we focus on the propagation of the modified exponential moment:

|GNb,sf |L1 d=ef
lN

R3

blf (v)

v 2sl (l!)s

dv,

which initially can be chosen sufficiently small provided that N is large enough. Since we still can get the damping for |GNb,sf |L1, it looks promising to control the quadratic term and then conclude the desired result.
и Idea of the proof for the lower bound of the convergence rate. Our strategy lies in the key observation that in the weighted L1 space, the equation still behaves like the damped hyperbolic equation. Moreover the damping term will become weaker and weaker if we localize the region that is more and more closer to the infinity. This property motivates us to localize the equation in the phase space with the initial data whose L1 moment is concentrated on the region |v|  2j with j  N sufficiently large. Loosely speaking, the above strategy can be translated to the following estimates:

|Pj f |L1l  |Pj f0|L1l - C2j (1 + t),

which shows that for a longtime period t  C2j(-)|Pjf0|L1l - 1, we have

|f (t) - M |L1  |Pj (f - M )|L1  C2-jl |Pj f0|L1l - |Pj M |L1l .

If |Pj f0|L1l  1, then for t  C2j(-) - 1,

1.5. Organization of the paper. Section 2 is devoted to introduction of the localization techniques and the proof of the commutator estimates. We prove the uniqueness in Section 3. In Section 4 and Section 5, we will show the global dynamics of the weak solution to the equation when initially the solution has the finite polynomial moment and the exponential moment. Technical tools and lemmas will be listed in appendix.

2. Localization and the commutator estimates
In this section, we first list some basic knowledge on dyadic decompositions. Then we use it to localize the equation (1.1) by the weak form (1.7).

2.1. Dyadic decompositions. We will introduce two types of the dyadic decomposition in phase and

frequency two radial

spaces. Let functions

j0
|j - k|  2  Supp (2-jи)  Supp (2-kи) = , j  1  Supp   Supp (2-jи) = .

We first introduce the dyadic decomposition in the phase space. The dyadic operator in the phase space Pj can be defined as

(2.2)

P-1f (x) := (x)f (x), Pj f (x) := (2-jx)f (x), j  0.

Let P~lf (x) =

Pkf (x) and Ujf (x) = Pkf (x) where N0  2 will be chosen in the later which

|k-l|N0

kj

verifies Pj Pk = 0 if |j - k|  N0. For any smooth function f , we have f = P-1f + Pj f.

j0

Next we introduce the dyadic decomposition in the frequency space. We denote m~ d=ef F-1 and ~ d=ef

F-1 where they are the inverse Fourier transform of  and . If we set ~j(x) = 23j~(2jx), then the dyadic

operator in the frequency space Fj can be defined as follows

Let F~jf (x) = j0 Fj f.

F-1f (x) := m~ (x - y)f (y)dy, Fjf (x) := ~j(x - y)f (y)dy, j  0.

|(v a)(v, )|  C,  m-||,

where C, is a constant depending only on  and . a(x, D) is called a pseudo-differential operator with the symbol a(x, ) if it is defined by

To

simplify the presentation of the estimates for the commutator [Pk, Fj](thanks to Lemma 6.3), we introduce

Pj,, Fj, and F^j, defined by

P-1,f := f, F-1,f := (D)f, F^-1,f := (2)(D)f,

Pj,f := (2-jи)f, j  0; Fj, := (2-jD)f, j  0; F^j, := (2)(2-jD)f, j  0.

Similar to P~j and F~j, we can also introduce

P~l, :=

Pk, ,

|k-l|<N0

(i). The support of the Fourier transform of Fjf and the support of Pjf will be localized in the annulus {| и |  2j};

(ii). It hold that for fixed N  N, |F~jf |L2 +

where the constants depend only on the lower bound of |f |L1 and the upper bound of |f |L12 + |f |L log L. Thus we only need to focus on the commutator FjQ(g, h) - Q(g, Fjh), Fjf .

2.2.1. Dyadic decomposition of the operator in the phase space. We first use the dyadic decompositions to reduce the commutator to the annulus in the phase space. We set

(2.4)

k(v) d=ef

|v| (2-k|v|), |v| (|v|), if

if k  0; k = -1.

Then we derive that





Q(g, h), f v =

Qk(g, h), f v =

Qk(Pj g, h), f v,

k=-1

k=-1 j=-1

where

Qk(g, h) :=

k(|v - v|)b(cos )(g h - gh)ddv.

S2 ,v R3

It is not difficult to check that there exists a integer N0  N such that(see also (2.1) in [14])

D3 d=ef Fj Q-1(g, h) - Q-1(g, Fj h), Fj f .

Let us explain a little bit on Di. Roughly speaking, D1 contains the commutators between localized operator Fj and the localized collision operator Qk; D2 focuses on the commutators between localized operators Fj and Pk; while D3 concentrates on the commutator for the singular part of the collision operator. The rest of the section is devoted to the upper bounds of D1, D2 and D3.

2.3. Estimate of D1. For D1, we first consider the estimate for | FjQk(g, h) - Qk(g, Fjh), Fjf |. We have the following lemma:

Lemma 2.1. For smooth function g, h and f , we have (i). If 2s < 1(  > -1),

(2.9) (ii). If 2s > 1,

| Fj Qk(g, h) - Qk(g, Fjh), Fj f | |g|L1|h|L2 |Fj f |L2 , k  0.

(2.10)

| FjQk(g, h) - Qk(g, Fjh), Fjf |

(iii). If 2s = 1(   -1),

2k(+2s-1)|g|L1 |h|L2 |Fj f |H2s-1 , k  0.

(2.11)

| Fj Qk(g, h) - Qk(g, Fjh), Fj f | 2k(+2s-1-)|g|L1 |h|L2 |Fj f |H2s-1- , k  0.

Proof.

Next we split the integration domain of A into two parts: 2|-|  2-k  and 2|-| > 2-k  . Correspondingly A can be decomposed into two parts: A1 and A2. The proof will be decomposed into three steps. The first two steps will focus on the proof of (2.10) and (2.11), that is, in the case of 2s  1. The we will explain how to extend the proof to the case (2.9) in the last step.
Step 1: Estimate of A1. In the region 2|-|  2-k  , for t  [0, 1], we have

Here we use the fact |(2-j) - (2-j( - ))| 2-j||. Due to (6.7), one has

Thanks to the above estimates, we conclude that for 2s  1, |A1| 2k(+2s-1)|g|L1 |h|L2 |Fjf |H2s-1 . Step 2: Estimate of A2. In the region 2|-| > 2-k  , since sin(/2) = |-|/||, it is easy to check that

Since we have k 2k and j 2j for any  > 0, then from the estimates of A1 and A2, we complete the proof for (2.10) and (2.11).
Step 3: The proof of case (2.9). The difference only lies in the decomposition of the integration domain. To prove (2.9), we separate the domain into regions: 2|-|   and 2|-|   . One may easily get desired results by following the same argument used in the previous steps.

Next we will use the dyadic decompositions in frequency space to improve the above results.

For B2 and B3, by Bobylev's equality, it is easy to see that FjQk(Fp g, Fph), Fjf and FjQk(Fpg, Fmh), Fjf enjoy the same structure as M4k,p,m and M1k,p,l defined in Lemma 6.10 respectively, then from Lemma 6.10 (i) and (iii), we have

|F1| CN |g|L12 (|Fj h|Hs/2 + 2-jN |h|H-N )(|Fj f |Hs- /21+2s-1 + 2-jN |f |H-N ). The same estimates hold for F2 and F3. We shall use the facts that  + 2s < 2 and |Uk+N0h|Ha  Ca,w2k(-w)+|h|Hwa (see Lemma 6.5(iii)) in the proof of F2 and F3. We complete the proof of (2.18). We finally remark that the other cases can be handled in a similar way. This ends the proof of the lemma.

2.4. Estimate of D2. Now we give the estimate of D2.

Lemma 2.4. For smooth function g, h and f , we have D2 CN |g|L12 (|Fj h|Hs/2 + 2-jN |h|H-N )(|Fj f |Hs- /21+2s-1 + 2-jN |f |H-N ),
where N  N can be large enough and Fj is defined in Definition 2.2.

Proof. We first focus on case: 2s > 1. We set D2 = H1 + H2 + H3, where

H1 =

Step 1: Estimate of H1. We first handle

Step 2.1: Estimate of R1. In the region 2|-|   , we have sin(/2)   /|| and  - t-   for t  [0, 1]. By Taylor expansion and Lemma 6.9((6.8)), we have

where

R1,1 = 2-j ||  -(+4)|| min{1, (  /||)2-2s}|(FSp+4N0 g)()(FFph)( - )(2-j)(Ff )()|dd,

R1,2 = 2-j ||  -(+5)||2(  /||)2-2s|(FSp+4N0 g)()(FFph)( - )(2-j )(Ff )()|dd.
и Estimate of R1,1. We split the integration domain of R1,1 into two parts:   || and  < ||, which are due to min{1, (  /||)2-2s}. Recalling that  2j,   2j and p  j, we have

R1,1

On the other hand, due to Bernstein inequality(see Lemma 6.4) and the fact j  p, we have 2-(3/2)j|Sp+4N0 g|L2 |Sp+4N0 g|L1 , which implies that R1,1 |g|L1 |Fph|Hs |Fjf |Hs . Then we conclude that

R1,1 min{|g|L2|Fph|L2 |Fj f |H2s-3/2 , |g|L1 |Fph|Hs |Fjf |Hs }.

и Estimate of R1,2. We have

R1,2

|Sp+4N0 g|L2 |Fph|Hs-1/2 |Fj f |Hs-1/2 . On the other hand, we also have

2-j max{2j(--2s+1), 1}|Sp+4N0g|L1 |Fph|Hs |Fj f |Hs |Sp+4N0 g|L1|Fph|Hs |Fj f |Hs .

These yield that R1,2 min{|g|L2|Fph|Hs-1/2 |Fj f |Hs-1/2 , |g|L1|Fph|Hs |Fj f |Hs }. Patching together the estimates of R1,1 and R1,2, we have

R1 min{|g|L2 |Fph|Hs-1/2 |Fj f |Hs-1/2 , |g|L1 |Fph|Hs |Fj f |Hs }.

Since 2|-| >  , in what follows, we will frequently use the facts that

и Estimate of R2,1. We have

Similar to R1,2, we easily have R2,1 min{|g|L2|Fph|Hs-1/2 |Fj f |Hs-1/2 , |g|L1 |Fph|Hs |Fjf |Hs }. и Estimate of R2,2. By change of variables  - -  ~(see the estimate of A2,1 in Lemma 2.1) and facts that  ,  - - 2j. We have

On the other hand, we may split the integration domain of R2,2 into two parts: | - -|   and | - -| <  . In the region | - -|   , thanks to Lemma 6.9, one may get | - -||F(-1)( - -)|  -(+2). While in the region | - -|   , we use the change of variables:  - -  ~(see the estimate of A2,1 in Lemma 2.1) and (2.26). Then we have

R2 min{|g|L1 |Fph|Hs |Fjf |Hs , |g|L2 |Fph|Hs-1/2 |Fj f |Hs-1/2 1s>1/2 + |g|L2 |Fph|H |Fj f |H 1s=1/2}. Finally patching together all the estimates, we conclude that

R min{|g|L1 |Fph|Hs |Fj f |Hs , |g|L2 |Fph|Hs-1/2 |Fj f |Hs-1/2 1s>1/2 + |g|L2 |Fph|H |Fj f |H 1s=1/2}. Step 2.3: Proof of (2.25). We introduce the following decomposition:

R  | Fj Q-1(Sp+4N0 gM , Fph) - Q-1(Sp+4N0 gM , FjFph), Fj f | +| FjQ-1(Sp+4N0 gM , Fph) - Q-1(Sp+4N0 gM , Fj Fph), Fj f |.

It is not difficult to see that

It ends the proof of (2.25). Step 3: Proof of (ii). We denote P := | FjQ-1(F~jg, Sj-3N0h), Fjf |. We have

Notice that ||  2j, ||  2j and | - | 2j-3N0 , then | - -| = | -  + +|  2j. We split the integration domain of P into two parts: 2|-|   and 2|-| >  and denote them by P1 and P2 respectively.

we conclude the estimate (2.24) and then end the proof of this lemma.

Next we use the dyadic decomposition in phase space to improve the above estimates. Indeed, we have the following lemma.

which implies (2.27).

Step 2: Proof of (ii). Observe that FjQ-1(F~jg, Sj-3N0h), Fjf = X1 + X2, where

X1 =

и Estimate of X1. We split X1 into two parts: X1 = X1,1 + X1,2 where

X1,1 =

и Estimate of X2. We will give the estimates term by term.

Estimate of X2,1. We have X2,1 = X2(,11) + X2(2,1) + X2(3,1), where X2(1,1) =

Estimate of X2,4. We introduce X2,4 = X2(1,4) + X2(2,4), where X2(,14) =

Q-1((PlF~j - F~j Pl)g,

l<N0 a>j-2N0

FaUN0 Sj-3N0 h), F2j UN0 f and X2(,24) =

The estimates of X2,2 and X2,3 could be handled in a similar manner as X2,1 and X2,4. We skip the details here and then conclude our desired result.

28

L. -B. HE AND J. JI

Step 3: Proof of (iii). For (iii), we introduce the following decompositions: FjQ-1(Sp+4N0 g, Fph)
4
- Q-1(Sp+4N0 g, Fj Fph), Fjf = Yi, where
i=1

Y1 =

Fj Q-1(PlSp+4N0 g, FpP~lh) - Q-1(PlSp+4N0 g, FjFpP~lh), FjP~lf ,

lN0

Y2 =

Fj Q-1(PlSp+4N0 g, FpUN0h) - Q-1(PlSp+4N0 g, FjFpUN0 h), FjUN0 f ,

l<N0

Y3 =

Q-1(PlSp+4N0 g, P~lFph), (P~lF2j - F2j P~l)f + Q-1(PlSp+4N0 g, P~lFjFph), (P~lFj - Fj P~l)f

lN0

+ Q-1(PlSp+4N0 g, Fj(FpP~l - P~lFp)h), Fj P~lf ) + Q-1(PlSp+4N0 g, (Fj P~l - P~lFj)Fj h), Fj P~lf ) ,

Y4 =

Q-1(PlSp+4N0 g, UN0Fph), (UN0 F2j - F2j UN0 )f + Q-1(PlSp+4N0 g, UN0 FjFph), (UN0 Fj - FjUN0 )f

l<N0

+ Q-1(PlSp+4N0 g, Fj(FpUN0 - UN0 Fp)h), Fj UN0 f + Q-1(PlSp+4N0 g, (Fj UN0 - UN0 Fj)Fj h), Fj UN0 f .

Since Y1 and Y2 enjoy almost the same structure, we only need to give the detailed proof for Y1. By (2.6),

we first note that Y1 =

Fj Q-1(Sp+4N0 PlSp+4N0 g, FpP~lh) - Q-1(Sp+4N0 PlSp+4N0 g, FjFpP~lh), Fj P~lf .

lN0

Then by (2.25), (2.30) and Lemma 6.5(iii), one has

|Y1|

|PlSp+4N0 gM |L2 |FpP~lh|H |FjP~lf |H + |PlSp+4N0 gM |L1 |FpP~lh|Hs |Fj P~lf |Hs

+|PlSp+4N0 gM |L2 |FpUN0 h|H |FjUN0 f |H + |PlSp+4N0 gM |L1 |FpUN0 h|Hs |Fj UN0 f |Hs ,

CN |gM |L21 (|Fj h|H- 1/2 + 2-pN |h|H-N )(|Fj f |H- 1/2 + 2-jN |f |H-N )

+CN |gM |L1- (|Fj h|Hs/2 + 2-pN |h|H-N )(|Fj f |Hs/2 + 2-jN |f |H-N ).

As for Y3 and Y4, let us choose Z :=

Q-1(PlSp+4N0 g, P~lFph), (P~lF2j - F2j P~l)f as a typical term to give

lN0

the estimate. It is easy to see that Z := Z1+Z2+Z3 where Z1 =

Q-1(PlSp+4N0 g, FaP~lFph), (P~lF2j -

lN0 |a-p|>N0

F2j P~l)f , Z2 =

Q-1(PlSp+4N0 g, FaP~lFph), Fb(P~lF2j - F2j P~l)f and

lN0 |a-p|N0 |b-j|>N0

Z3 =

Q-1(Sp+6N0 PlSp+4N0 g, FaP~lFph), Fb(P~lF2j - F2j P~l)f .

lN0 |a-p|N0 |b-j|N0

Applying the argument used for G(21,1), one may obtain that |Z1 + Z2| CN 2-2jN |g|L1 |h|H-N |f |H-N . For

 + 2s  0, thanks to Lemma 6.10(ii), we have

|Z3|

(22sj |Sp+6N0 PlSp+4N0 g|L1|P~lFph|L2 |Fb(P~lF2j - F2j P~l)f |L2 .
lN0 |b-j|N0

Then (2.20), Lemma 6.5(iii) and Lemma 6.6 yield that

|Z3|

CN |g|L11 |Fph|H-s-1/12/2 (|Fj f |H-s-1/12/2 + 2-jN |f |H-N ).

From these, we get that |Z| CN |g|L11 (|Fj h|H-s-1/12/2 +2-jN |h|H-N )(|Fj f |H-s-1/12/2 +2-jN |f |H-N ). We complete the proof of (iii) by patching together the estimates of Y1 and Z. This ends the proof of the lemma.

Lemma 2.7. For smooth function g, h and f , we have

D3 CN (|gM |L21 + |g|L11 )(|Fj h|H- 1/2 + 2-jN |h|H-N )(|Fj f |H- 1/2 + 2-jN |f |H-N ) + CN |gM |L1- (|Fj h|Hs/2

3. Regularization estimates and the proof of Theorem 1.3
This section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.3. To do that, we first investigate the regularization estimates in Sobolev space Hpm under the assumption that f0  L1l with l  2. Finally we use it to show that the integrable condition stated in Theorem 1.1 is fulfilled.

Thus

we

conclude

our result and then end the proof of the lemma.

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 1.3.

Proof of Theorem 1.3. Thanks to Lemma 3.1, we get the quantitative estimate for the regularization effect.

It helps to prove the integrability condition stated in Theorem 1.1. We split the proof into two cases.

Case 1: max{-3/2, -2s} <  < min{-4s2 - 4s + 7, 0}. In this case, we will show that any weak solution

f (t, v)

satisfies

that

|f (t)|Lp

is

integrable

locally

in

time

for

some

p

>

3 3+

.

To

do

that,

we

resort

to

Lemma

3.1. Under the restriction that  < min{-4s2 - 4s + 7, 0}, by Remark 6.2, we have max{l1, l2, l3}  2(see

Lemma 3.1 for the definition of li(i = 1, 2, 3)). This in particular shows that for any   1,

|f (t)|L2

t-

3+2 4s

1t1

+

(1

+

t)1t>1.

Thanks to the interpolation theory that for 1  p  2, |f |Lp  |f |L2/1p-1|f |L2-2 2/p, one has

|f (t)|Lp

t-

(3+2)(p-1) 2sp

1t1

+

(1

+

t)1t>1,

which implies that f



L1loc((0, ); Lp(R3)) if 1



p

<

3 3-2s

.

Due

to

the condition that 

>

max{-3/2, -2s},

we

have

3 3+

<

p

<

3 3-2s



2.

This

proves

the

integrable

condition

stated

in

Theorem

1.1

and

then

get

the

uniqueness.

Case 2: the other cases. We first remark that Case 1 covers the case s < 3/4. Therefore we may assume that s  3/4. By Remark 6.2, if n := 2s +  - 3/2, then max{l1, l2, l3}  max{/2 + (2s - 1)(3s + 2), 2}. Assume that f0  L1max{/2+(2s-1)(3s+2),2}, then by Lemma 3.1, we know that

|f (t)|Hn



C t 1 n

-

2n+3+2 4s

Then

by

for

we

have

|f (t)|Lp

From this

we deduce

that

|f (t)|Lp

is

if

Since

3 3+

we

can

choose

some

such

that

|f (t)|Lp

in

which

implies

the

uniqueness.

We complete the proof of Theorem 1.3.

3.2. The estimate of norm | и |Hpm . Next we give the estimate for the high order Sobolev regularity. We have the following lemma:

Lemma 3.2. Suppose m, p  0, 0 <   1. Let f (t, v) be a weak solution to (1.1) with f0  L1l where l  m + p + 5/2. Then

where (3.2)

J(m, p, l)

:=

Proof. Thanks to the interpolation inequality, if m < n, one has |f |Hm

where d~ = 4d + (1 - 4)(l4 - 2)/(l - 2)(see the definition of d in Lemma 3.1). Choose n := l - 5/2, then the

condition

l



m + p + 5/2

implies

that

l

Moreover,

d~ =

4. Proof of Theorem 1.4: global dynamics
In this section, we shall use the entropy method for Boltzmann equation to get the longtime behavior of the relative entropy H(f |M )(see the definition (1.4)). Once it is clear, it will help us to improve the estimates on the propagation of L1 moments and the Sobolev regularity. We consider t  1 in what follows.

4.1. The first glance of the convergence rate for the relative entropy. We begin with: Lemma 4.1. Suppose that the non-negative function f verifies (1.2) and |f |L log L  M . Then

T(f )  C(M ), Proof. We first have

where

T(f ) := min f (v)(v и e)2dv.

result.

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 1.4. We first show the rough convergence rate for the relative entropy H(f |M ).

Proposition 4.1. Suppose that l  C1,s,K(see (1.9)). Let f (t, v) be a weak solution to (1.1) with f0  L1l . Then for t  1,

H(f |M )(t) C(l, K, H(f0))(1 + t)-(l),

Proof. We split the proof into several steps.
Step 1: Lower bound of the solution. Assume that f0  L1l . From (3.1), Lemma 3.2 and Sobolev embedding theorem, if l > max{6, K + 2}, we have

|f (t)|L1l (1 + t), |f (t)|L3 + |f (t)|W 2,

To make valid the above argument, we need to check the conditions that l > max{6, K + 2} and a < 1.

Due

to

we

have

Therefore one may check that the condition l  C1,s,K

implies that

4.2. Improving the smoothing estimate and convergence rate. With the help of the convergence of the relative entropy, we can improve the smoothing estimate and then in turn improve the convergence rate.

Proposition 4.2. Recall that C(m, p) = max{m + p + C2,s,K , C1,s,K} with m, p  0. Then if l  C(m, p),

then for t  1, |f (t)|Hpm

Therefore

the

It is not difficult to check that if l  C(m, p), then the solution f satisfies (4.2) and (4.3) which implies the

if

then

Proof. We prove it in the perturbation framework. Let h be the perturbation such that f = M + h, where M defined in (1.3). Then Equation (1.1) becomes

(4.4)

th = Q(M , h) + Q(h, M ) + Q(h, h).

We aim to prove the uniform-in-time propagation of L1 moment for h. By multiplying both sides of (4.4) by sgn h v l and integrating over v, we obtain that

Observing that

|h(t)|L1l

+l2al( v 2 + v 2)l/2-2(|v|2|v|2 - (v и v)2))dvdv.

For the left-hand side, we observe that

|v - v| fdv  (|v|/2)1|v|R(1 -

fdv)  2-|v| 1|v|R(1 - 12/R2),

|v|R/2

We turn to the estimates of terms in the right-hand side. Recall that f = M + h, then by the fact l2al 2l, we obtain that

M|h||v - v| (c2ls( v 2 v l-2 + v 2 v l-2) + c3l-1 v l + l2al( v 2

Then it remains to estimate

h|h||v - v| (c2ls( v 2 v l-2 + v 2 v l-2) + c3l-1 v l + l2al( v 2 + v 2)l/2-2(|v|2|v|2 - (v и v)2))dvdv.
R6

Let us focus on the term involving c3l-1 v l. Let  d=ef R6 |h||h|||v - v| v ldvdv, we split it into two

parts 1 and 2 according to the integration domains |v|  1 and |v| > 1 respectively. It is easy to see

that

Let p = 3. Thanks to (1.17) and the fact |h|L32 |h|H21/2 , if l > C(1/2, 2), then |h(t)|L32 is bounded uniformly in time for t  1. By interpolation, we deduce that

Now we may conclude the uniform-in-time bounds of L1 moment if (l)/2 > 1. It is easy to see that the

This ends the proof of the proposition.

End of the proof of Theorem 1.4. The results except (1.15) are proved in Lemma 3.2, Proposition 4.1, Proposition 4.2 and Proposition 4.3.

4.4. Proof of (1.15): lower bound of convergence rate. In this subsection, we shall prove the lower
bound of the convergence rate for the longtime behavior of the solution. The main idea is to use the localized techniques to focus on the propagation of the L1 moment when initially it concentrates the region which is far away from the original point. Recall that Pj (v) v l = (2-jv) v l, then we have

d dt

Pj (v)f (t, v) v ldv
R3

=

Pj (v)Q(f, f ) v ldv.
R3

We begin with a localization lemma:

Lemma 4.2. Let (v) be a smooth function satisfying supp  {v|1/2 < |v| < 3} and (v) = 1 if v  supp , where  is defined in (2.1), j(v) = (2-jv). Suppose that f (t, v) is a weak solution to Eq.(1.1) with |f0|L1l <  for some l  2. Then we have

d dt

|Pj

f

|L1l

-2j |f |L1l (1

+

|f |L1 (-1-

)+

+

|f |L23/2 ).

Proof. We only provide the detailed proof for 2s  1. It is easy to check that

d dt

|Pj

f

|L1l

=

Q(f, Pj f ) v ldv +

[Pj Q(f, f ) - Q(f, Pjf )] v ldv d=ef I + II.

|v|2j

|v|2j

Step 1: Estimate of II. One has

II =

[Pj Q(f, f ) - Q(f, Pjf )] v lj(v)dv

R3

=

b(cos )|v - v| f (v)f (v)j(v) v l((2-jv) - (2-jv))dvdvd.

Since |v|  2j, we split the integration domain into three parts: |v|  2j, |v|  2j and |v|  2j. Correspondingly II can be decomposed into three parts: II1, II2 and II3 respectively.

Estimate of II1. By Taylor expansion, one has

from which together with the estimate of II, we get the desired result. Finally we mention that the case of 2s < 1 can be proved in a similar way. We complete the proof of this

5. Proof of Theorem 1.5: propagation of exponential moment and its application
In this section, we will prove the propagation of exponential moment. To do that, we begin with some basic facts about Gamma function and Beta function which will be used frequently.

5.1. Gamma function and Beta function. Gamma function and Beta function are defined by



1

(x) :=

tx-1e-tdt, x > 0, B(p, q) := tp-1(1 - t)q-1dt, p, q > 0.

0

0

We recall that Beta and Gamma functions fulfill the following properties:

B(p, q)

=

(p)(q) (p + q)

,

 (x + 1)  2x

x e

x
, x  1.

Lemma

5.1.

(i).

Let

  (0, 1).

Then

for

any

x

1 2

,

y



1 2

and

z

> 0,

we

have

(5.1)

(x

+

z)

z

(x)xz ,

(y)



y



(y

)(y

)

1 2

(-1),

where z means the equivalence depends on z. In particular, for k > 0, we have

(5.2)

(k + 1)  2k+1((k/2 + 1/2))2((k + 1)/2)1/2  2k+1(k/2 + 1/2)(k/2 + 1).

(ii). Let   (0, 1) and k > 0. Then

1



(1 - t)tkdt  (k + 1)-2, | cos |kd  (k + 1)-1/2.

0

0

Proof. (i). We consider the first equivalence in (5.1). We only need to prove it for x > 2 because (x + z) and (x)xz have positive lower bounds and upper bounds when x  [1/2, 2]. Now we assume that x > 2.
Thanks to the asymptotic formula of Gamma function, we have

(x + z)/(xz(x)) 

1 + z/x

1 + z/x e

z
(1 + z/x)x.

Using the condition x > 2, we get the desired result.

We turn to the second equivalence in (5.1). Again we only need to consider it in the case that y > 3

because

(y)

and

y



(y)(y

)

1 2

(-1)

have

upper

bounds

and

positive

lower

bounds

if

1 2

y

.

If

y > 3, thanks to the asymptotic formula for Gamma function, we have

(y

)/(y

1- y -

which

the

result.

In

particular,

if

and

y

we

have

)



(

1 2

)

k+1 2



1 2

(k

1)(

k+1 2

)-

1 4

.

It yields that (k + 1)  2k+1((k/2 + 1/2))2((k + 1)/2)1/2. Moreover, by (5.1), we have (k/2 + 1) 

(k/2 + 1/2)((k + 1)/2)1/2, which implies

2k+1((k/2 + 1/2))2((k + 1)/2)1/2  2k+1(k/2 + 1/2)(k/2 + 1).

UNIQUENESS AND GLOBAL DYNAMICS OF THE BOLTZMANN EQUATION

(ii). Due to the fact that

01(1 - t)tkdt

=

B(k

=

(2)(k+1) (k+3)

,

and

(5.2),

we

have

(k

(k + 1)(k + 1)2, which implies 01(1 - t)tkdt  (k + 1)-2. Since

=

B((k

Again by (5.2), we have (k + 2)/2)  ((k + 1)/2))((k + 1)/2))1/2, which implies

 0

| cos |kd



(k + 1)-1/2. We complete the proof of this lemma.

5.2. Propagation of exponential moment. Assume that Gb,(v)f0  L1 with -/2    s. From Proposition 4.3 and any fixed l < , |f (t, и)|L1l is bounded uniformly in time. Thus to prove the result, we only need to focus on the propagation of the quantity

|GNb,f |L1 d=ef
jN

R3

where N can be arbitrary large. To get (1.22), we reconsider the propagation of L1 moment to have

5.3. Reduction of R. We begin with a useful lemma:

Lemma 5.2 (see [5]).

Let h

:=

v+v |v+v

|

,

n

:=

v-v |v-v

|

,

j

:=

h-(hиn)n
1-(hиn)2

and

E()

:=

v 2 cos2(/2)+ v 2 sin2(/2).

Then (i).  = cos n + sin  with   S1(n) d=ef {  S2|  n}; (ii). h и  = (h и n) cos  +

1 - (h и n)2 sin (j и ); (iii). v 2 = E() + sin (j и )h~ and v 2 = E( - ) - sin (j и )h~ where

h~

:=

1 2

|v + v|2|v - v|2 - (v + v)2 и (v - v)2 =

|v|2|v|2 - (v и v)2.

From this lemma, we can make the reduction for R. If 2s  1, by Taylor expansion,

v 2j = (E() + sin (j и )h~)j = (E())j + j(E())j-1h~ sin (j и )

1
+j(j - 1) (1 - t)(E() + th~ sin (j и ))j-2dth~2 sin2 (j и )2.

Due to Lemma 1.1 and the fact S1(n)(j и )d = 0, we have

(5.3)

b(cos )( v 2j - v 2j )d + c(j)s v 2j

S2

(j)s( v 2 v 2j-2 + v 2 v 2j-2) + j-1 v 2j

Proof. We only provide the detailed proof for the case 2s  1. The other case can be derived similarly. Since -/2    s, one has N0  3 and (N0 - 1)  2 < N0. We divide R into two parts: I and II, which correspond to the integration domains |v - v|   and |v - v| <  respectively. Here  > 0 will be fixed later.

where j и  = cos . Since (N0 - 1)  2 < N0, then j - 2 = (j - N0) + N0 - 2. Using the facts that

Next we divide Ce into two parts when k is even and when k is odd, and denote them by Ce1 and Ce2 respectively.

Estimate of Ce1. When k is even, by the change of variable from k to 2k, we have

We change variable again from m + k to m to get that

Ce1

k=0 m=k,m+k1 (k + 1/2)(k + 1)(m - k + 1)(j - N0 - m - k + 1)

О(k + 1)-5/2(j - m)-s-1m-s+1j2s-2(j - 2)(-N0+3).

Thanks to (j - m)  (j - m - N0 + 1)(j - m - N0 + 1)N0- and (m)  (m + N0)(m + N0)-N0 , we deduce that

Ce1

k=0 m=k,m+k1 (k + 1/2)(k + 1)(m - k + 1)(j - N0 - m - k + 1)

О(k + 1)-5/2(j - m)-s-1+N0-m-s+1-N0j2s-2(j - 2)(-N0+3).

Notice that

(j - m - N0 + 1)(m + N0)

(k + 1/2)(k + 1)(m - k + 1)(j - N0 - m - k + 1)

=

(j - m - N0 + 1)

Then by exchanging the summation order, we derive that

where we use conditions that N0 > 2 and  < 1 to ensure that -5/2 + (N0 - 1/2) > -1. Estimate of Ce2. Since k is odd, we may rewrite it by 2k - 1. Then one may copy the argument in the above for Ce2. In particular, when we sum up with respect to m and k, we shall use the change of variables from m + k to m. At the end, we may obtain that

To apply the estimates of Ce1 and Ce2 to J1,2, we need to change the factor ( v 2)(j-k/2-m)+/2-1( v 2)(m+k/2)+1 in J1,2. Thanks to the fact v  v , we have

J1,2 Ce1( v 2)(j-m-1)++/2-1( v 2)m+1 + Ce2( v 2)(j-m-1/2)++/2-1( v 2)(m-1/2)+1.

From this, we are led to that

Patching together the estimates of J1,1 and J1,2, we obtain the estimate of J11 v  v . For v < v , we notice that h~ min{|v|, |v|}|v - v| |v||v|, |v - v|2+ v 2+ and (E() +
th~ sin (j и ))N0-2 (max{ v 2, v 2} cos2(/2))N0-2 = ( v 2 cos2(/2))N0-2. Then by similar calculation, we can obtain that

Next we explain how to prove the upper bound of J11 v < v by following the estimate of J11 v  v .

((j-k/2-m)-s-1)((m+k/2)-s+1) (j-2s))

is

exactly as the same as J11 v  v and has been treated in the estimate of J1,1 and J1,2. We only need to take care of the exponents of v and v in J11 v < v which are different from J11 v  v . However the good news lies in that when we give the estimate of Ce1 and Ce2, we change variable from m + k/2 to

m if k is even and from m + (k + 1)/2 to m if k is odd. These properties perfectly match the exponents

of the factors ( v 2)(j-k/2-m-N0)+1 and ( v 2)(m+k/2+N0)+/2-1 in J11 v < v . Therefore the estimates for Ce1 and Ce2 are still valid for J11 v < v which induces the desired result. We conclude the result that J1 B(j, v, v).
Finally we give some comment how to generalize the estimate of J1 to J~1. Notice that E( - ) = v 2 sin2(/2) + v 2 cos2(/2). It is not difficult to see that J1 and J~1 enjoy the symmetric structure with

respect to the variables: v and v. This implies the desired result by just switching the role of v and v in

the estimate of J1. We complete the proof of this lemma.

A similar result holds for J2 and J~2. We have the following lemma:

48

L. -B. HE AND J. JI

Proof. The proof is similar to that for Lemma 5.4. Let us point out the main difference. The first is that
we shall use the decomposition j - 1 = (j - N1) + N1 - 1. Secondly, since (N1 - 1)  1,  < 1/2, we get that -5/2 + (N1 - 1/2) < -1, so the summation over k is finite. We omit the details here and then complete the proof of the lemma.

5.5. Proof of Theorem 1.5. Now we are ready to give the proof of Theorem 1.5.

Proof of Theorem 1.5: Part I. We will provide the detailed proof for s  1/2. Since J1 and J~1 enjoy the

symmetric property(see Lemma 5.4), by Lemma 5.3, we only need to consider j2 R3ОR3 |J1|f fdvdv. The

proof is split into several steps. Let us first assume that N0 is even.

we

that

This ends the proof of the theorem when N0 is even.

To complete the proof, we explain how to apply our argument in the above to the case that N0 is

odd. When N0 is even, two types of the interpolation inequality are used. The typical estimates are

(5.9)

and

(5.10)

where

we

use

the

facts

1

=

(N0/2) + ((N0 - 2)/2)(1 - )

with



=

1-(N0/2-1) 

and

1 = ((N0 + 1)/2)~ + ((N0 - 1)/2)(1 - ~) with

~ =

2-(N0-1) 2

.

When

N0

is odd,

it

is

not difficult

to

see

that the roles of  and ~ are switched. Keep it in mind, then we can obtain that

Then by the similar argument used in the before, we can get the desired results.

Finally we mention that the same result can be proved for s <

We omit the

details and then complete the proof.

6. Appendix
In this appendix, we list some basic knowledge on the localized techniques in phase and frequency spaces and then prove some useful lemmas.

6.1. Improved Povnzer's inequality. Thanks to Lemma 1.1, if l  8, we can choose c1 = /16 and c3 = 32. Based on this, it is easy to conclude that
Lemma 6.1 (see [16]). Under the conditions in Lemma 1.1, it holds

v l - v l b(cos )d + c1ls v l  c2ls v 2 v l-2 + v 2 v l-2 + c3l-1 v l

where al :=

This is crucial to prove the propagation of the exponential moment Gb,.

6.2. Pseudo-differential operator and commutators.

Lemma 6.2 (see [14]). Let s, r  R and a(v), b()  C satisfy for any   Z3+,

(6.1)

|Dva(v)|  C1, v r-||, |Db()|  C2,  s-||

for constants C1,, C2,. Then there exists a constant C depending only on s, r and finite numbers of C1,, C2, such that for any f  S (R3),
|a(v)b(D)f |L2  C| D s v rf |L2 , |b(D)a(v)f |L2  C| v r D sf |L2 . As a direct consequence, we get that | D m v lf |L2  | v l D mf |L2  |f |Hlm .

Lemma 6.3 (see [14]). Let l, s, r  R, M ()  S1r,0 and ()  S1l,0. Then there exists a constant C such that |[M (Dv), (v)]f |Hs  C|f |Hlr-+1s-1 . Moreover, for any N  N,

(6.2)

M (Dv) = M (Dv) +

1 !

M

(Dv

)

+

rN

(v,

Dv

),

1||N

where (v) = v, M () = () and v N-lrN (v, )  S1r,-0N . Moreover, for any ,   Z3+, we have v  rN (v, )  C,  r-N-|| v l-N-||.

Remark 6.1. We emphasize that in the statement of Lemma 6.3, the constant C appearing in the inequality
depends only on C1,, C2, in (6.1) with a =  and b = M and also the contants C, for rN (v, ). This fact is crucial for the estimates of commutators and the profiles of weighted Sobolev spaces. For instance,
if M (Dv) and (v) are chosen to be the localized operators Fj and Pk, the constant C in Lemma 6.3 does not depend on j and k. Indeed, for any k  0, N  N, 2Nk(2-kv) satisfies that for any   Z3+,

(6.3)

|Dv2Nk(2-kv)|  CN, v N-|||(2-kv)|  CN, v N-||.

Moreover, in this case, the term rN (v, ) appearing in (6.2) satisfies v  r2N +1(v, )  C,  -N -1-|| v -N -1-||.

It is clear that CN, and C, do not depend on j and k.

6.3. Localization techniques and profiles of weighted Sobolev spaces.

Lemma 6.4. (Bernstein inequality). There exists a constant C independent of j and f such that (1) For any s  R and j  0,

C-12js|Fj f |L2(R3)  |Fjf |Hs(R3)  C2js|Fj f |L2(R3).

(2) For integers j, k  0 and p, q  [1, ], q  p, the Bernstein inequality are shown as

Lemma 6.5. If Pk, Uk and Fj are defined in in Definition 2.1, then (i). For any N  N and s < 1, then there exists a constant CN such that





2N

|[Pk, Fj ]f |Hs = |(PkFj - Fj Pk)f |Hs  CN 2-j2-k

2N

|[Uk, Fj ]f |Hs = |(UkFj - Fj Uk)f |Hs  CN 2-j

|Uk,Fj,f |Hs + 2-jN |f |H-N  ,

||=1

where Pk,, Fj, and Uk, are defined in Definition 2.1. Moreover, replace Pk, and Fj, by P~k, and F~j, respectively, the above results still hold.
(ii). For |m - p| > N0 and N  N, there exists a constant CN such that
|FmPkFpg|L2  CN 2-(p+m+k)N |Fpg|L2, |FmUkFpg|L2  CN 2-(p+m)N |Fpg|L2 .

54

L. -B. HE AND J. JI

If m > p + N0, we have |FmPkSpg|L2  CN 2-(m+k)N |Spg|L2,

|FmUkSpg|L2  CN 2-mN |Spg|L2 .

(iii) For any a, w  R, we have |Uk+N0 h|Ha  Ca,w2k(-w)+ |h|Hwa and |Sp+N0 h|L2l  Cl|h|L2l . (iv) For any j  -1 and l  R, we have |Fjf |L1l + |Sj f |L1l  Cl|f |L1l .
Proof. We first address that all the constants derived in the below are universal thanks to Remark 6.1. (i). If k  0, j  0, due to Lemma 6.3, we have

In particular, we have  sr2N+1(v, ) v N  S1-,0N-1, by the Sobolev boundedness of pseudo differential operator, we know that |r2N+1(v, Dv)f |Hs  CN |f |H--NN  CN |f |H-N , which implies the first inequality. The second inequality can be proved similarly and we omit the details. We also remark that the cases that k  0, j = -1, k = -1, j  0 and
k = -1, j = -1 can be proved in the same manner.
(ii). Since |m - p| > N0, we have FmFp = 0, then

|FmPkFpg|L2 = |[Pk, Fm]Fpg|L2 = 2-kN 2-mN |(2kN Pk2mN Fm - 2mN Fm2kN Pk)Fpg|L2 = 2-kN 2-mN |r2N+1(v, Dv)Fpg|L2 ,

where we use the fact that Fm,Fp = 0. Since r2N+1(v, )  S1-,0N-1, we have

|FmPkFpg|L2 = 2-kN 2-mN |r2N+1(v, Dv )Fpg|L2  CN 2-(m+k)N |Fpg|H-N  2-(m+p+k)N |Fpg|L2 .

Other inequalities can be proved similarly. (iii). We first prove the first inequality. By the definition of Uk+N0, we have (Uk+N0 h)(v) = [(v) + jk+N0 k(v)]h(v) := ~k+N0 (v)h(v). Thanks to Lemma 6.3 and the facts that if w  0, v(~k+N0 v -w)
v -w-|| v -||, and if w < 0 v(2kw~k+N0 v -w) v -||, we deduce that
|Uk+N0 h|Ha |~k+N0 v -w ( v w h)|Ha 2k(-w)+ |h|Hwa .
The second inequality can be proved by Lemma 6.3 and the fact that Sp+N0  S10,0 and и l  S1l,0. Indeed, noting that (Sp+N0 f )(v) = F-1((+ kp+N0 (2-kи))Ff )(v), we have that ((+ kp+N0 (2-k)))  C  -|| with the constant C independent of p. Then we complete the proof.
(iv). We first prove first inequality with j  0. We have

By Young inequality and the facts |~j |L1 = |~|L1 and | и l~j|L1

|~|L1l , we deduce that |Fj f |L1l 

Cl|~|L1l |g|L1l . We remark that the case of j = -1 can be handled similarly.

Noting that (Sjf )(v) = F-1(( + kj (2-kи))Ff )(v). By setting Vj = F-1( + kj (2-kи)), we

may copy the argument for the first inequality to obtain the desired result. We complete the proof.

(6.6)

Then we have

(1) For k  0, i  N

(6.7)

where N can be arbitrarily large. (2) For k = -1,

(6.8)

|iF(-1)()|  -(+3+i).

Proof. For k  0, by definition, it is easy to see that

(6.9)

F(k )(y) = 2(+3)kF(0 )(2ky), iF(k )() = 2(+3+i)ki(F(0 )(2k)).

Then

|F(k )(y)||y|dy = 2k(+3) |F(0 )(2ky)||y|dy = 2k(-1) |F(0 )(y)||y|dy 2k(-1).

Since iF(0 ) is a Schwartz function, for any N  N, we have iF(0 )()  CN,i  -N . From this together with (6.9), we conclude the result.

For k = -1, we prove it for i = 2 and i = 0, 1 can be handled similarly. We only need to consider large

. By direct calculation, one has

ij F(-1)() = Cij (| и |-3-  (F))() = C R3 ij F()( - )||-3- d.

We split the integration domain into two parts || > 1 and ||  1. Since F()  S and    - 

for ||  1, it is easy to obtain that ||1 ijF()( - )||-3- d

 -(+5). On the other hand,

integrating by parts, we have

ijF()( - )||-3- d =

jF()( - )i - F()( - )ij dS +

F()( - )ij ||-3- d.

The first term in the right-hand side can be bounded by  -(5+), and for the second term, we have

|F()( - )|  -  (5+)d  -(5+)  -(5+).

Then we conclude the results and end the proof.

Lemma 6.10 (see (2.3), Lemma 2.1, Lemma 2.2 and Lemma 2.3 in [14]). Recall that k(v) is defined by (6.6). Then we have the following decomposition

6.5. Differential inequalities.

Lemma 6.11. If X(t) is a non-negative continuous function satisfying that

d dt

X (t)

+

C1X (t)1+



C2,

where C1, C2 are positive constants, then for any t > 0, X(t)  max{(4C2C1-1)1/(1+), (4C1-1)1/t-1/}.

Proof. We split R+ into two parts: R1 = {t  0|C1X(t)1+  4C2} and R2 = {t  0|C1X(t)1+ > 4C2}. We

only need to consider ordinary differential inequality in the region R2. Since R2 is an open set, without lose of

generality, we assume that (t1, t2)  R2 with t1 < . In the period (t1, t2), using the fact C1X(t)1+ > 4C2,

we

derive

that

X (t)

+

C1 4

X (t)1+



0,

which

implies

that

X(t)  min{X(t1), (4C1-1)1/(t - t1)-1/}, t  (t1, t2).

If t1 = 0, then X(t)  (4C1-1)1/t-1/. If t1 > 0, then by continuity, C1X(t1)1+ = 4C2, which implies that X(t)  (4C2C1-1)1/(1+). We conclude that t  (t1, t2),

X (t)  max{(4C2C1-1)1/(1+), (4C1-1)1/t-1/}.

It is easy to see that the above bound is still valid for any t  R2. This is enough to conclude our result since X(t) keeps bounded in the region R1.

Lemma 6.12. Suppose that Y (t) is a non-negative continuous function satisfying that

d dt

Y

A(1

+

t)-aY

(t)1+b



M (1

(0,

),

where a, b, c, A and M are positive constants. Then there exist a constant C = max{(M A-12a+c+2)1/(1+b), (A-12a+2)1/b, A-1/b, M } and d = max{a/b, c} such that

Y (t)  Ct-1/b1t1 + C(1 + t)d1t>1.

Proof. We split the proof into two cases: t  1 and t > 1. When t  1, one has Y (t)+ A2-aY (t)1+b  M 2c.

By Lemma 6.11, t  (0, 1] we have Y (t)  max{(M A-12a+c+2)1/(1+b), (A-12a+2)1/bt-1/b}  Ct-1/b.

When t > 1, we split interval (1, ) into two parts: R3 = {t  (1, )|A(1 + t)-aY (t)b  1} and

R4 = {t  (1, )|A(1 + t)-aY (t)b > 1}. For region R3, we have Y (t)  A-1/b(1 + t)a/b, so we only need to

consider region R4. Since R4 is an open set, we may assume that (t3, t4)  R4, where t3 verifies that t3 = 1

or

Y (t3)

=

A-1/b

(1

+

t3)

a b

.

The

ordinary differential

inequality

turns

to

Y (t)+Y (t)



M (1+t)c,

t



(t3, t4),

which implies

Y (t)  Y (t3) + M (1 + t)c  max{(M A-12a+c+2)1/(1+b), (A-12a+2)1/b}

+A-1/b(1

+

t)

a b

+

M (1

Then we conclude our result in the region R4. Since the bound is still valid for any t  R3, we complete the proof of this lemma.
