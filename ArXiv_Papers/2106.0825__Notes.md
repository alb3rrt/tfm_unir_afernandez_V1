## Abstract

We experimentally study the dynamics of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms in a 1D optical lattice with a periodic driving force. The time evolution is analysed after a quench of the driving strength which leads to an inversion of the dispersion relation in the lattice band and to a redistribution of atoms in the 1st Brillouin zone (BZ). We use the concept of a negative effective mass and the resulting changes to the effective trapping potential and interaction strength to explain the time evolution of wave packets with weak repulsive interaction. In addition, the formation of stable wave packets with a negative effective mass is observed at the center of the BZ, and we interpret these as gap solitons in a periodically driven system.
