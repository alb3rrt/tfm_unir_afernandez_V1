ABSTRACT
Reverberation mapping (RM) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has been used over the past three decades to determine AGN broad-line region (BLR) sizes and central black-hole masses, and their relations with the AGN's luminosity. Until recently the sample of objects with RM data was limited to low-luminosity AGNs (Lopt 1046 ergs s-1) and low redshifts (z 0.5). Here we present results from a reverberation-mapping project of some of the most luminous and highest redshift quasars that have been mapped to date. The study is based on almost twenty years of photometric monitoring of 11 quasars, six of which were monitored spectrophotometrically for 13 years. This is the longest reverberation-mapping project carried out so far on this type of AGNs. We successfully measure a time lag between the C IV  1549 broad emission line and the quasar continuum in three objects, and measure a C III]  1909 lag in one quasar. Together with recently published data on C IV reverberation mapping, the BLR size is found to scale as the square root of the UV luminosity over eight orders of magnitude in AGN luminosity. There is a significant scatter in the relation, part of which may be intrinsic to the AGNs. Although the C IV line is probably less well suited than Balmer lines for determination of the mass of the black hole, virial masses are tentatively computed and in spite of a large scatter we find that the mass of the black hole scales as the square root of the UV luminosity.

1. INTRODUCTION
Over the past three decades the reverberationmapping technique has been used to determine the size of the broad line region (BLR) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and to infer their black-hole (BH) masses in about 200 objects (for reviews see Peterson 1993, 2006; Netzer & Peterson 1997, and references therein). Reverberation mapping uses the response of the emission lines from the BLR to continuum variations and measures the time lag of the response, which is interpreted as an es-

timate of the light-travel time, and hence the physical separation, between the BH and the bulk of the BLR gas. A recent compilation of reverberation-mapped objects can be found in Bentz & Katz (2015)1, Du et al. (2015, 2016, 2018), Shen et al. (2016), and Grier et al. (2017, 2019).
Almost all reverberation-mapping studies have focused on low-redshift AGNs with optical luminosities (L(5100°A)) lower than 1046.5 ergs s-1. Reverberation mapping of high-luminosity AGNs is quite challenging; their BLR sizes are expected to be large and their continuum variations are slow. Combining these features

with the cosmological time dilation at high redshift, the reverberation mapping campaigns must span a period of a decade or more, necessitating very long-term commitment of observing facilities. In addition, large telescope collecting areas are required due to the faintness of such quasars.
Several early reverberation-mapping efforts for highluminosity quasars were unsuccessful at detecting reverberation time lags, e.g., Welsh et al. (2000), Trevese et al. (2006, 2007) and A. Marconi (2005, private communication), due to the insufficient duration of these projects. Trevese et al. (2014) reported 11 years of monitoring of the z = 2.048 quasar PG 1247+267; however, their sampling was poor (one to three points a year) and the model-independent methods used to derive the time lag are not sufficiently accurate: using the modeldependent2 method of Stochastic Process Estimation for AGN Reverberation (SPEAR) developed by Zu et al. (2011) they claimed a significant time-lag measurement which, however, we consider questionable. Saturni et al. (2016) reported a reverberation mapping study of APM 08279+5255 over 12 years, also with a rather limited sampling rate. They use the model-dependent JAVELIN method (Zu et al. 2013) a development of SPEAR, to estimate the time lag. Inspection of their figure 4 shows that the use of JAVELIN introduces several model points inside long gaps in the data, i.e., there are no real overlapping measurements in the data used to determine the lag. This greatly lowers the significance of this result and we will not consider it further here.
Shen et al. (2016) have reported preliminary results of 15 BLR lag measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping (SDSS-RM) project. The project targets almost 850 AGNs with redshifts up to z = 4.5 and expects to deliver BLR lag measurements for a few hundred. The reported preliminary lag measurements are for intermediate-luminosity quasars at 0.3 z < 0.8 and include nine H lags and six Mg II lags. Further BLR lag measurements from that project have been reported by Grier et al. (2017) who measured H and H BLR lag measurements for a total of 44 and 18 quasars, respectively, at the redshift range of 0.1 < z < 1.1. They find that, in most objects, the time delay of the H emission is consistent with or slightly longer than that of H. Their black-hole mass measurements are mostly consistent with expectations from single-epoch black-hole mass measurements and the local MBH ­ relation.
2 In that it adopts a reasonable Damped Random Walk based interpolation approach, see Yu et al. (2019) and Li et al. (2019).

Lira et al. (2018) describe a reverberation-mapping project which targeted 17 high-luminosity quasars for more than 10 years. These authors are able to measure statistically significant (> 1) time lags for the emission lines of Ly (8 objects), C IV (8 objects), Si IV (3 objects), and C III] (1 object). Altogether significant time lags were measured for 10 distinct objects. Lira et al. (2018) give an updated C IV radius­luminosity relation, and presented for the first time a radius­luminosity relation for the other three lines. They report that the regions responsible for the emission of Ly, Si IV, C IV, and C III] are commonly interior to that producing H, but there is no clear stratification among them. Approximately 18% (3/17) of their sources show an unexpected behavior in some emission lines in which the line light curves do not appear to follow the observed UV continuum variations. This is similar to the recent behavior detected in the AGN NGC 5548 in which during a monitoring of 180 days the BLR had a period of  40 days in which it did not follow the UV continuum variations (Goad et al. 2019).
Hoormann et al. (2019) report C IV reverberation mapping time lags for two objects from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN) and the Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES) at redshifts of 1.9 and 2.6. In that study the photometric monitoring covers five years while the spectroscopic monitoring was 3­4 years. Out of the 393 objects with C IV in their sample, they identified a subset of objects which were expected to have lags of the order of 1 yr. They further cut the sample to 23 objects which were variable and had high-cadence data, but only two of them had significant time-lag measurements.
In a recent paper Grier et al. (2019) report on C IV reverberation-mapping time lags from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping project. They report time lags for 52 AGNs, with an estimated falsepositive detection rate of 10%. 16 of these AGNs are defined as their "gold sample" with the highest-confidence lag measurements. These 16 AGNs lay in the redshift range of 1.4 < z < 2.8 and luminosity range of 1044.5 < L(1350°A) < 1045.6 erg s-1. Adding these 16 objects to the objects with C IV time lag measurements of previous studies they find the radius--luminosity relation has a slope of 0.52 ± 0.04. Shen et al. (2019) show how adding photometric data to the spectroscopic monitoring of this project can improve the detection of time lags. They report on three more objects with detected C IV time lags.
In Kaspi et al. (2007; hereafter Paper I) we presented the first results from our reverberation-mapping campaign of several high-luminosity AGNs. In this paper

TWO-DECADE REVERBERATION MAPPING STUDY OF HIGH-LUMINOSITY QUASARS 3

we report the final results from this campaign after 18 years of photometric and 13 years of spectroscopic monitoring. This is the longest single reverberation-mapping campaign carried out to date (only one object surpasses this, the multiple campaigns on NGC 5548 over the past two decades). Section 2 describes the observations and the data-reduction process. Section 3 presents the results. Section 4 analyzes the new results, combined with the results of other reverberation-mapping campaigns of high-luminosity AGNs that have yielded significant results.
Throughout this paper we use the standard cosmology with H0 = 70 km s-1 Mpc-1, M = 0.3, and  = 0.7.
2. SAMPLE, OBSERVATIONS, AND DATA REDUCTION
The sample, observations, and data processing are described in detail in Paper I. For completeness we summarize them here and note differences where applicable.
The photometric sample consists of 11 high-luminosity quasars with observed magnitude of V 18 and redshift in the range 2 z 3.4. The luminosity range is 1046.9 L(1350 °A) 1048.0 ergs s-1, which translates to 1046.6 L(5100 °A) 1047.8 ergs s-1 (see Table 1 for details). Six of the objects in our sample are radio loud and five are radio quiet (see Paper I for details). All objects are at high declination ( +60) to enable largely uninterrupted yearly coverage from the Northern hemisphere.
Photometric observations were obtained at the Wise observatory 1 m telescope in the Johnson-Cousins B and R bands, from 1995 to mid-2013. The only difference from the description of Paper I is that during 2006 the Tektronix CCD was replaced with a Princeton Instruments camera with a E2V 1300 × 1340 CCD which had similar field of view and quantum efficiency; exposure time and sampling rate were unchanged from the description in Paper I. Exposure times for all objects were 250 and 300 sec in the R and B bands, respectively, except that for S5 2017+744 we used 300 and 400 sec. Each object was observed photometrically about once a month for eight months each year. Photometric uncertainties are of order 0.03 mag. The data have been reduced using IRAF3 procedures in the standard way.
Spectroscopic observations were performed for six of the 11 photometrically-monitored AGNs at the HobbyEberly Telescope (HET; Ramsey et al. 1998). Spectra

were obtained starting in 1999 with the Low Resolution Spectrograph (LRS; Hill et al. 1998), which began its primary observations in 1998, and spectroscopic observations continued until the instrument was decommissioned in mid-2013. Spectra were taken with a long slit which included the AGN and a field star which was used for flux calibration. Observations typically consisted of two consecutive exposures of the quasar/star pair with exposure times (for each exposure) of 900 sec for S4 0636+68 and SBS 1116+603, 600 sec for S5 0836+71 and SBS 1233+594, and 300 sec for SBS 1233+594 and HS 1700+6416 (three of these objects are radio-loud AGNs and three are radio-quiet AGNs). We observed each of the six objects about three to four times each year with two-to-three month separation between observations. The total program time amounted to roughly 12 hours of HET time each year (including overheads). The spectroscopic data were processed using standard IRAF routines as described in Paper I.
Figure 1 shows the mean and rms4 spectra of the six spectroscopically monitored quasars. We used the mean and rms spectra to identify line-free spectral bands which are suitable for setting the continuum underlying the emission lines, and the wavelength limits for integrating the line fluxes. The spectral ranges for the lines and the continuum bands on both sides of each line are given in Table 2. The detailed measurement process is as described in Kaspi et al. (2000) and in Paper I.
3. RESULTS
3.1. Continuum and Line Light Curves
The light curves for the six spectroscopically monitored objects are presented in Figures 2 to 7 with the data listed in Tables 4 and 5. The photometric R-band light curves were merged with the spectroscopic continuum light curves as described in Paper I in order to increase the sampling of the continuum light curve. The different bands used for the flux measurements are listed in Table 3 for each object (wavelengths are given in the observed frame). The number of observations as well as statistical information about the light curves are provided at the bottom of Table 3. Columns are (1) the object name, (2) the particular light curve, (3) the number of points in that light curve, (4), (5), and (6) the mean (f¯), rms (), and the mean uncertainty () of all data points in the light curves, respectively, in the appropriate units for each light curve, (7) the 2 obtained by fitting a constant to the light curve, and (8) P(2|), the probability to obtain such 2 if there were

a N is the number of points in each light curve. The continuum light curve for each object is a merge of the R-band light curve and the continuum spectroscopic light curve. The R band has a few more points in the light curve than the B band since it is somewhat less sensitive when observing through bad-weather. Thus, for each object the number of points in the continuum light curve is slightly larger than the sum of the number of points in the line light curve and the B-band light curve.
b Units are 10-16 erg cm-2 s-1 °A-1 for the continuum light curves, 10-14 erg cm-2 s-1 for the emission-line light curves, and apparent magnitude for the R-band and B-band light curves.

3.2. Time Series Analysis
In order to measure a time lag that can serve as an estimate for the BLR size one usually cross correlates the line and continuum light curves. Two commonly used methods were applied. The first is the Interpolated

Cross-Correlation Function (ICCF; Gaskell & Sparke 1986 and Gaskell & Peterson 1987 as implemented by White & Peterson 1994). In this approach one light curve is cross correlated with a linear interpolation of the second light curve, then the second light curve is cross correlated with a linear interpolation of the first light curve, and then the final cross correlation is the average of these two cross correlation functions. The time lag is then determined as the centroid of all points in the ICCF with correlation value above 80% of the peak correlation value.
The second method is the z-transformed discrete correlation function (ZDCF: Alexander 1997) which is an improvement of the Discrete Correlation Function (DCF) method suggested by Edelson & Krolik (1988). The ZDCF applies Fisher's z transformation to the correlation coefficients, and uses equal population bins instead of the equal time bins that are used in the DCF. We also applied the JAVELIN method to our data. JAVELIN (Zu et al. 2013) uses the assumption that all emission-line light curves are scaled, smoothed, and displaced versions of the continuum. It fits the light curves directly using a damped random walk model and aligns them to recover the time lag and its statistical confidence limits. We find that with our detailed light curves JAVELIN produces similar results to the ICCF and ZDCF methods. In the following we refer only to the first two methods.
Figures 2 to 7 present the ICCF and ZDCF of the two lines (out of the three lines Ly, C III] and C IV) which were monitored in each object. We consider a time lag as significant5 if the CCF possesses a maximum with peak correlation larger than 0.5 (e.g., Kaspi et al. 2000, Lira et al. 2018) in both the ICCF and ZDCF, and that it is a result of a significant overlap between the continuum and line light curves. We then calculated the uncertainties on the time lags of the ICCF method using the model-independent Monte Carlo method Flux Randomization/Random Subset Selection (FR/RSS) of Peterson et al. (1998). This method yields a CrossCorrelation Centroid Distribution (CCCD) of the time lags found in the Monte Carlo simulations of the light curves, and this distribution is used to estimate the uncertainties. The CCCDs for our time lags are shown in Figure 8. The range of uncertainty is taken as the range which includes the central 68% of the CCCD realizations, i.e., the 16% at the two edges of the distribution are omitted and the central range determines the uncertainty range. This is demonstrated by the vertical

dashed lines in Figure 8. Once the uncertainty range is determined the centroid of the ICCF, of the full two light curves, is taken as the time lag and its plus and minus uncertainties are calculated to encapsulate this uncertainty range.
He II 1640 is usually a weak line relative to C IV 1550 in high-luminosity AGNs. This is evident from the mean spectra shown in Fig. 1 where the line is absent or barely detected. This is also shown in Dietrich et al. (2002). Although they find the Baldwin relation (Baldwin 1977) is about the same for both lines, the flux of the He II 1640 line in their composite quasar spectra is much weaker than the C IV 1550 flux. The He II 1640 line falls outside of the measured ranges listed in Table 2, so this line does not affect our measured C IV time lag.

3.3. Notes on Individual Objects
The reported significant C IV time lags are listed in Table 6. Here we list notes on the time lags found in individual objects.
3.3.1. S4 0636+68
No time lag is detected in the two emission lines that we monitored, Ly and C IV.
3.3.2. S5 0836+71 A C IV time lag of 188+-2377 days in the quasar rest frame was detected in this object as we previously reported in Paper I. The current result is consistent with the result we preliminarily found a decade ago when we had only about half the data we are reporting in this work.

TWO-DECADE REVERBERATION MAPPING STUDY OF HIGH-LUMINOSITY QUASARS 15

The CCF of C III] with the continuum in S5 0836+71 shows a time lag of about 3570 ± 140 days in the observed frame. Although formally significant, we note that this time lag is a result of the cross correlation of the first three years of the continuum light curve with the last three years of the C III] light curve. This is too brief of an overlap interval to detect significantly such a large time lag, and we do not claim this detection as significant. This was also not detected in Paper I due to the shorter monitoring period reported there.
Jorstad et al.(2013) reported an increase in the -ray activity of S5 0836+71 on March 2011 based on Fermi observations, which lasted for a year. They also report on a sharp -ray flare at the end of 2011, which was also accompanied by an increase in the optical brightness of the quasar by  0.5 mag in the R band. This is in accord with our light curve presented in Figure 3 which shows that flare at the same time. No other such strong flares are seen in our light curves. Our result is not sensitive to this flare since it occurred about two years before the end of our campaign and any response to that continuum flare in the lines would be after the end of our observations.
3.3.3. SBS 1116+603
A C IV time lag was detected for this object, though this was not detected in paper I, probably due to the shorter monitoring period and because there was no significant variability feature in the light curve in that period.
A C III] time lag was also detected in this object and it is found to be 262+-7722 days in the rest frame. This is the only object where we detected a significant C III] time lag out of the three objects in which we monitored that line.
3.3.4. SBS 1233+594
There is a hint of a Ly time lag in the ICCF at about 165 days in the rest frame. However, this peak is not detected with the ZDCF method and using the FR/RSS method the lag is consistent with zero. We therefore exclude this result from further discussion. For the second line monitored in this object, C IV, no time lag was detected.
3.3.5. SBS 1425+606
A C IV time lag is detected but no Ly time lag. In paper I no time lag was detected for this object as the continuum light curve in the first 10 years of the monitoring shows only a gradual rise, and a shorter-timescale feature of luminosity increase and decrease was detected only in the last eight years of monitoring.

3.3.6. HS 1700+6416
Even though the continuum light curve shows variability and features of higher and lower luminosity, no line variations are detected in response to these continuum changes in the two emission lines that we monitored, Ly and C IV.
3.3.7. Summary
We found line time lags for three out of the six monitored objects. Two of these AGNs are radio loud and one is radio quiet (see Table 1). In paper I we reported on preliminary results from the first 5 years of monitoring, including one preliminary time lag measurement. No other lines showed statistically significant time lags in the first 5 years of monitoring. In this paper we find that after adding 8 more years to make a total of 13 years of spectrophotometric monitoring we can measure time lags for three objects out of the six. This supports the idea that a monitoring period of more than a decade is needed in order to carry out a successful reverberationmapping campaign on quasars at the high end of the luminosity range.
Half of the objects in our sample are radio loud and their continuum luminosity variability may be affected not only by the central accretion disk, as is assumed in reverberation mapping, but also by the jet. Several studies (e.g., Le´on-Tavares et al. 2013; Paltani & Tu¨rler 2003) found evidence for components of the BLR that respond to jet flares seen in gamma-ray energies. However, the gamma-ray flares and the response seen in emission lines like Mg II, H and H, are on short time scales of days to weeks and our current study is not sensitive to such timescales due to our cadence of more than a month. Thus, the effect of possible jet flares on our time-lag results are negligible and probably well within our reported uncertainties.
We measured the rest-frame equivalent width of the lines in our spectra to be 10°A to 20°A for the C IV emission line and between 50°A to 100 °A for the Ly emission line. These values are in accord with other high-redshift high-luminosity AGNs (e.g., Constantin et al. 2002; Dietrich et al. 2002); this indicates that there is not large optical dilution by a beamed jet optical continuum in these sources (e.g., Shaw et al. 2012).
Due to the small number of objects in our campaign and the small number of time lags which are detected, it is hard to find a way to estimate the number of false detections in our study, which suffers from very small number statistics. A basic way to estimate the number of false detections is to look at the number of peaks on the negative side of the CCFs that could be declared

16

KASPI ET AL.

as significant time lags6. A careful inspection of our 12 CCFs yields that, if using the criteria to define a peak when it appears clearly both in the ICCF and ZDCF and has a peak coefficient above 0.5, then no feature on the negative side of the CCF can be defined as a significant peak. This reinforces our detected positive lags as being true detections.

4. DISSCUSSION
4.1. C IV BLR Size -- Luminosity Relation
In Table 6, we list the three objects for which we have found significant and reliable C IV reverberation lags. To these we add a compilation of previous measurements, including C IV BLR sizes for a few Seyfert AGNs which were reanalyzed and compiled by Peterson et al. (2004, 2005), Metzroth et al. (2006), and De Rosa et al. (2015). Lira et al (2018) reported time lags for eight high-luminosity quasars, but with a number of mistakes which were corrected in a recent erratum (e.g., a few wrong rest-frame time lags and their uncertainties in their table 4 and mismatched objects in their figure 7); these mistakes were only in the presentation and did not affect their final analysis. The numbers in Table 6 include all the corrections to the Lira et al (2018) measurements. We also include in Table 6 the two quasars reported by Hoormann et al. (2019), and also the 16 objects which are the "gold sample" of Grier et al. (2019), and the three objects from Shen et al. (2019). Figure 9 displays the 38 objects from Table 6 with reliable and significant C IV time-lag measurements.
Linear regression for the C IV BLR size -- Luminosity Relation is performed with the two methods detailed in Kaspi et al. (2005, 2007): (1) the FITEXY approach of Press et al. (1992, p. 660) with the Tremaine et al. (2002) procedure to account for the intrinsic scatter in the data, and (2) the bivariate correlated errors and intrinsic scatter (BCES) regression method (Akritas & Bershady 1996). The two techniques take into account the uncertainty in the BLR size, the luminosity, and the intrinsic scatter around a straight line. The fit from the FITEXY method (solid line in Fig. 9) is

6 As defined in sec. 3.2, we consider a time lag as significant if the CCF possesses a maximum with peak correlation larger than 0.5 in both the ICCF and ZDCF, and that it is a result of a significant overlap between the continuum and line light curves.

For these data the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.90

with significance level of 4 × 10-13 and the Spearman

rank-order correlation is 0.80 with a significance level of

1 × 10-10. The intrinsic scatter using the Tremaine et

al. (2002) procedure is 58%. These results are similar

to those found by Lira et al. (2018; a slope of 0.46 ± 0.08

and a constant of 0.22 ± 0.10) and are in accord with the

preliminary results reported in Kaspi et al. (2007). The

uncertainties are about half of these reported by Lira

et al. (2018). Our slope is also consistent, within the

uncertainties, with that measured by Grier et al. (2019)

who find a slope of 0.51 ± 0.05 for their full sample, and

a slope of 0.52 ± 0.04 for their gold sample.

Almost all objects in Figure 9 lie in the range of 1043 L(1350 °A) 1048 ergs s-1, i.e., covering five
orders of magnitudes in luminosity. There is one object

three orders of magnitudes below that range: NGC 4395 at L(1350 °A)  1040 ergs s-1. Thus, this one object
may via its statistical leverage influence significantly the

BLR size -- Luminosity relation. Repeating the fit with-

out NGC 4395 in the sample we find a slope of 0.40±0.04

using the FITEXY method and 0.38 ± 0.05 using the

BCES method. This may indicate that the true rela-

tion has a shallower slope than the theoretically pre-

dicted slope of 0.5, though further reverberation studies

on lower-luminosity AGNs are needed in order to better

understand this issue.

We have found a significant C IV time lag for three

out of our six spectroscopically monitored quasars, i.e.,

in 50% of the objects studied. This success rate is com-

parable to that of Lira et al. (2018) who found C IV

time lags for eight out of their 17 monitored quasars. In

contrast, while Lira et al. (2018) found also Ly time

lags in 50% of their objects, we have found only a hint

of a Ly time lag in one of our objects. This is probably

because in two of our objects only part of the Ly line is

within the spectral range covered, in one it is outside the

range, and in the other two cases the light curve is too

noisy due to low S/N at the blue end of the spectrum

and the many absorption lines from the Ly forest. We

measure one significant C III] time lag, as did Lira et al.

(2018). This line is much weaker than C IV and hence

its light curves are noisy and challenging for time-lag

detection.

All six AGNs in our spectrophotometrically monitored sample show significant 1350°A continuum variations at

the level of 20%­70%. However, we detect correspond-

ing C IV variations only in half of the them. This is

similar to Lira et al. (2018) who also do not find corresponding variations in the C IV light curves of about half of their AGNs sample, in spite of significant variations in their continuum light curves. This may suggest that the ionizing continuum in high-luminosity AGNs behaves differently from the 1350°A continuum and that this different behavior is a common phenomenon in these objects.

Comparing the H BLR size to the C IV BLR size
is important for constraining BLR models which aim to
produce the BLR emission lines (e.g., Netzer 2020). The
calculated BLR models predict that the C IV BLR size
is about half the H BLR size. Using the measured relation of H BLR size and the luminosity L(5100°A) of the entire sample in eq. 5 of Du et al. (2015) and the estimated L(5100°A) of the objects in our sam-

Figure 9. C IV BLR size -- UV Luminosity relation. Time lag is in the quasar rest frame.

ple (Table 1)7, we can estimate the H BLR size for the three objects in which we measured the C IV BLR size. We find H BLR sizes of 650+-211600 light days for S5 08036+71, 855+-229250 light days for SBS 1116+603, and 1360+-532800 light days for SBS 1425+606. The ratio between these sizes and the C IV BLR sizes measured in this work shows a large scatter between 3 to 13. This is mainly due to the exceptionally small C IV BLR size which we measured in SBS 1116+603. Also the fact that we use only three objects and not a larger sample does not enable proper statistics with small standard deviation. Thus, in order to compare the H and C IV BLR sizes, it is better to use the mean relations. We therefore compare the mean relation between the C IV BLR size and L(1350°A) which we find in eq. 1 to the mean relation between the H BLR size and L(5100°A) from Du et al. (2015). Using these averaged measured BLR sizes we find that for L(5100°A)=1045 erg s-1 the ratio between the H to C IV BLR sizes is 3.3, while for L(5100°A)=1047 erg s-1 this factor is 4.1 . This

is larger than previously predicted by BLR models and thus a change in the models (Netzer 2020) may be needed in order to fit the observations.
4.2. Mass -- Luminosity Relation
Assuming gravitationally dominated motions of the BLR clouds, the central masses of AGNs can be estimated using MBH = f G-1V 2r where V is an estimate of the velocity of the BLR around the central mass and r is an estimate of the typical distance between the BLR gas and the central BH. f is a scaling factor which embodies our ignorance of the BLR geometry and velocity field (e.g., Peterson et al. 2004). This method to estimate MBH has been widely used, over the past two decades, with various choices for f and for the observational indicator of v, mainly for BLR distances determined from reverberation mapping of the H emission line.
Although several attempts have been made to estimate MBH from C IV emission-line reverberation (e.g., Vestergaard & Peterson 2006; Park et al. 2013) it was found that this line has several drawbacks. The width of the C IV line is weakly correlated with the width of low-ionization lines like H and Mg II. Also, the C IV

TWO-DECADE REVERBERATION MAPPING STUDY OF HIGH-LUMINOSITY QUASARS 19

profiles often show large blueshifts and asymmetries that indicate non-virial motions (e.g., Baskin & Laor 2005; Netzer et al. 2007; Shang et al. 2007; Richards et al. 2011; Trakhtenbrot & Netzer 2012). Coatman et al. (2017) used a sample of 230 quasars to quantify the bias in C IV black-hole masses as a function of the C IV blueshift and suggest an empirical formula to derive the black-hole mass from the C IV emission line properties. On the other hand, Mej´ia-Restrepo et al. (2018) further studied the possibility that C IV can serve for blackhole mass estimates from a single-epoch spectrum by using three different methods to improve the measurement. They find these methods to be of limited applicability, mostly because they depend on correlations that are driven by the line width of the C IV profile and not by an interconnection between the line width of the C IV line and the line width of the low-ionization lines. The conclusion of Mej´ia-Restrepo et al. (2018) is that C IVbased mass estimates at high redshift cannot serve as an alternative for estimates based low-ionization lines like H, H, and Mg II.
Mej´ia-Restrepo et al. (2016) used a sample of 39 AGNs at z  1.55 that have measurements of both the H and C IV emission lines to measure black-hole mass from the two lines. In addition, Vietri et al. (2020) used a sample of 21 AGN at z  2 with measurements of these two lines to derive the black-hole masses from the two lines. In both studies the agreement between the derived masses from the two lines is poor, and this confirms the inconsistency of mass estimates based on the C IV emission line.
Dalla Bonta´ et al. (2020) study black-hole masses in AGNs based on single-epoch spectra. They used the compilation of reverberation-mapped AGNs by Bentz & Katz (2015) and the AGNs from the SDSS-RM project as well. These authors find that the line dispersion of the C IV emission line is a better proxy for estimating the black-hole mass than the FWHM. They find that, in addition to luminosity and line width, a third parameter is required to obtain accurate masses and that parameter seems to be the Eddington ratio, and they present empirical relations for estimating black-hole masses from the H and C IV emission lines.
Nevertheless, since for high-luminosity, high-redshift (z  3), quasars there are no low-ionization line reverberation-mapping measurements, and most measurements which can be obtained are of the C IV line, it is interesting to estimate the black-hole mass and to check its correlation with the luminosity, even given the above limitations. We note that from our mean spectra (Figure 1) we find that the C IV emission line is not broader and not blueshifted relative to the Ly emis-

sion line. Thus, the mass estimates of the objects in our sample may be more reliable as our objects are free from some of the above limitations which discourage the use of C IV for mass estimates.
For simplicity and given the very basic assumptions, we use the equation given by Kaspi et al. (2000; Equation 5 therein) where the FWHM of the line is used as theBLR clouds' velocity and it is corrected by a factor of 3/2, to account for velocities in three dimensions. The FWHMs we use are listed in Table 6 together with the derived masses. Fig. 10 shows the black-hole mass and UV luminosity relations for the 38 AGNs listed in Table 6. A fit using the FITEXY method (solid line in Fig. 10) is

and for the BCES method (dashed line in Fig. 10) it is

For these data the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.79 with significance level of 5.4 × 10-9 and the Spearman rank-order correlation is 0.56 with a significance level of 2.5 × 10-4. The intrinsic scatter using the Tremaine et al. (2002) procedure is 240%.
Theoretically we expect MBH  L0.5 which emerges since MBH  V 2r and because it is found that r  L0.5, thus also the black-hole mass will be proportional to L0.5. Since the velocity of the BLR (taken here as the FWHM of the line) does not evolve with the luminosity it only introduces scatter in the black-hole mass for a given luminosity; thus the scatter in this relation is larger than the scatter found earlier between the size of the BLR and the luminosity. It should also be noted that the sample in Table 6 does not represent the AGN population in luminosity or in black-hole mass; thus, the relations found in equations 3 and 4 may relate more to way the sample was selected, i.e., all objects with significant C IV BLR size measurements.
For five Seyfert AGNs out of the six in Table 6 there are black-hole mass estimates from H reverberation mapping. In Table 7 we list these black-hole mass estimates as given in the database of Bentz & Katz (2015)8. From a comparison of these mass estimates to our estimates from the C IV line in Table 6 we find that for NGC 7469 and 3C 390.3 the black-hole mass estimates from the two lines are within the 1 uncertainties

(i.e., the 1 uncertainties overlap). For NGC 3783 and NGC 4151 the black-hole mass estimates are within the 1.5 uncertainties (if we add the  from both measurements), and for NGC 5548 they are within 2. This resemblance in the mass estimates from the two emission lines increases the confidence in these results and in the ability of the reverberation-mapping method to give consistent mass estimates.
5. SUMMARY
We have reported the final results from a 13year spectrophotometric reverberation-mapping campaign on high-luminosity quasars. The spectrophotometric observations were supplemented by 18 years of photometric monitoring, which improved the cadence and the accuracy of the spectrophotometric continuum light curves, by adding to them the photometric light curves.
All 11 objects with photometric light curves display continuum variability of 10%--70% over about six years in the rest frame. This value is similar to that reported in paper I with data over a period which was about a third of the current one. Six of the 11 objects were monitored spectroscopically. We identified C IV emission-line

time lags for three objects indicating C IV emission-line region sizes of order 100 to 250 light days. Together with data from previous studies, we have constructed a C IV BLR size -- UV luminosity relation over eight orders of magnitude in UV luminosity; the slope of 0.45 ± 0.04 is consistent with previous studies and with photoionization theory.

TWO-DECADE REVERBERATION MAPPING STUDY OF HIGH-LUMINOSITY QUASARS 21

Although all our monitored AGNs show significant continuum variation, only in about half of them we measured C IV time lag (same fraction was also was found by Lira et al. 2018). This may indicate that the ionizing continuum behaves differently from the 1350°A continuum we measured in this study.
Although C IV is not a preferable line for the central black-hole mass determination, we derive the mass for the 19 objects with proper C IV reverberation mapping data. We find that the mass scales approximately as the square root of the UV luminosity, but with a large scatter. The scatter probably results, at least partly, from the drawbacks of the C IV line for black-hole mass measurement, but probably also includes an intrinsic scatter in that relation for AGNs, e.g., different velocities for given BLR size.
Our results demonstrate that for reverberation mapping of high-luminosity quasars to succeed a long monitoring period is needed, of order a decade or more, and a large enough sample is required in order to be able to detect the responses to continuum variations in at least some of the objects in the sample. Curent studies for C IV reverberation mapping cover mostly the UV luminosity range above 1043 erg s-1 and more studies are needed to cover the lower-luminosity range of the AGNs phenomenon.

APPENDIX

A. PHOTOMETRIC LIGHT CURVES AND ANALYSIS
Figures 11 and 12 and Table 8 present the R and B band light curves of the five quasars which were observed only photometrically at the Wise Observatory. Also, Figure 13 and Table 9 present the B band light curves for the six spectroscopically monitored quasars for which their R band light curves were merged into the spectroscopic continuum light curves and are shown in Figures 2 to 7
In several cases multiple observations of a given quasar were obtained during the same night; these measurements were averaged into one point in the light curve. Apparent magnitude calibration was achieved by using non-variable stars in the field of each quasar with B and R magnitudes taken from the USNO-A2.0 catalog.9 The number of observations as well as statistical information about the light curves are provided at the bottom of Table 3.
We have cross correlated the photometric B and R band light curves for all objects. The CCF results are listed in Table 10 and two examples of CCFs are shown in Figure 14. The significance of the results is not high since the monthly sampling rate limits the detected time lags. Also, there is probably a mixture of lines and continuum in some of these broad bands. Such mixture a will cause the detected variations in the broad bands to be superpositions of the continuum variations and the line variations, which are not in phase. This limits the ability to determine the time lags between the red continuum and the blue continuum in these AGNs. Nevertheless, three objects (SBS 1116+603, SBS 1425+606, and S5 2017+744) show, formally, negative time lags both in their centroid and the peak of the CCF.

This formally means that the R band light curve is lagging the B band light curve. Although we do not refer to these results as highly significant, this is in accordance with results from other reverberation-mapping studies which found that the red continuum emission of AGNs is lagging the blue continuum emission (e.g., Collier et al. 1998, Edelson et al. 2019, Chelouche et al. 2019).
