## Abstract

Information extraction (IE) from visually-rich documents (VRDs) has achieved SOTA performance recently thanks to the adaptation of Transformer-based language models, which demonstrates great potential of pre-training methods. In this paper, we present a new approach to improve the capability of language model pre-training on VRDs. Firstly, we introduce a new IE model that is query-based and employs the span extraction formulation instead of the commonly used sequence labelling approach. Secondly, to further extend the span extraction formulation, we propose a new training task which focuses on modelling the relationships between semantic entities within a document. This task enables the spans to be extracted recursively and can be used as both a pre-training objective as well as an IE downstream task. Evaluation on various datasets of popular business documents (invoices, receipts) shows that our proposed method can improve the performance of existing models significantly, while providing a mechanism to accumulate model knowledge from multiple downstream IE tasks.
