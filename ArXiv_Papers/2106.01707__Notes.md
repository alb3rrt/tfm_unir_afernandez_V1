## Abstract

We extend results of parametric geometry of numbers to a general diagonal flow on the space of lattices. Moreover, we compute the Hausdorff dimension of the set of trajectories with every given behavior, with respect to a nonstandard metric and thereby attain bounds on the standard ones.
