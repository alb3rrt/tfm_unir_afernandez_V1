## Abstract

In this paper, first musical compositions are presented, which are created using the mathematical counterpoint theory of Guerino Mazzola and his collaborators. These compositions also use the RUBATO(R) software's components for counterpoint constructions. The present work aims at opening new "exotic" directions of contrapuntal composition in non-Fuxian worlds. The authors would like to receive first impressions about these compositions, which are available as scores and audio files.
