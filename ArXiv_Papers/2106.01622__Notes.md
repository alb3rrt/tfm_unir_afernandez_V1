## Abstract

We investigate the scalar-tensor gravity of Damour and Esposito-Far√®se (DEF) with spontaneous scalarization phenomena developed for neutron stars (NSs). Instead of solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for slowly rotating NSs via the shooting method, we construct a reduced-order surrogate model to predict the relations of mass, radius, moment of inertia, effective scalar coupling, and two extra coupling parameters of a NS to its central matter density. We code the model in the pySTGROMX package that speeds up the calculations at two and even three orders of magnitude and yet still keeps accuracy at $\sim1\%$ level. Using the package, we can predict all the post-Keplerian parameters in the timing of binary pulsars conveniently, which allows us to place comprehensive constraints on the DEF theory in a quick and sound way. As an application, we perform Markov-chain Monte Carlo simulations to constrain the parameters of the DEF theory with well-timed binary pulsars. Utilizing five NS-white dwarf and three NS-NS binaries, we obtain the most stringent constraints on the DEF theory up to now. Our work provides a public tool for quick evaluation of NSs' derived parameters to test gravity in the strong-field regime.
