June 3, 2021
Abstract
We derive an effective membrane theory in the thin film limit within a two phase material model for a specimen consisting of an elastic matrix and soft inclusions. The soft inclusions may lead to the formation of cracks within the elastic matrix and the corresponding limiting models are described by Griffith type fracture energy functionals. We also provide simplified proofs of relaxation results for bulk materials.

1 Introduction
We examine materials consisting of two phases: an elastic matrix and inclusions therein whose elastic moduli are negligible as compared to the moduli of the matrix. In stark contrast to the effects caused by elastic or even rigid inclusions, the occurrence of a very soft phase poses severe analytical challenges, whose physical origin lies in the possible formation of voids. Here the specimen no longer exhibits elastic response but rather becomes arbitrarily flexible at virtually no energetic cost.
In applications the occurrence of two phases can model a variety of quite different systems of relevance. For a single material they may describe the fundamental solid and fluid phases at the onset of solid/liquid phase transition. A related example, which is of particular interest in engineering applications, are shape memory alloys subject to moderate deformations with co-existing austenite and martensite phases, whenever the latter is superelastic with a degenerate elastic response, see e.g. [HM93]. Our model is, however, not restricted to single materials but can also describe mixtures in which an elastic material is invaded by a (chemical or biological) substance that causes extremely soft regions to develop with an elastic behavior as that of voids. As a culinary example we mention the formation of holes due to propionic acid bacteria in Swiss cheese. An important geophysical example is the immersion of water in gypsum rock [AHS04, ZXL+19] and the resulting softening which may have severe impact on the stability of mining goafs [ZXL+19, WLL+19]. We finally mention cerebral softening as a medical example [KIY+11, NK19] in the light of recent elastic models of brain tissue [MBH+17]. At variance with other common models involving composite materials such as [FGP09, BS13, BLZ16, CDMSZ19], in such situations the position and geometry of the soft inclusions are not pre-assigned.
In this paper we focus on thin films with reference configuration h = ×(0, h)  R3 of small `membrane heights' 0  h  1. Our aim is to provide a dimensionally reduced membrane theory in the limit h  0 for thin films consisting of an elastic matrix and a soft inclusion. Our result extends the classical work for purely elastic materials in [LDR95] and for brittle materials in [BF01, BFLM02]. This is achieved

defined on function-set pairs. Here D  h represents the shape of the voids, u : h  R3 is a Sobolev map representing the elastic displacement field, W is the stored energy function and  is an arbitrary norm, which allows to model a possibly anisotropic surface energy on D  h depending on the (exterior) normal (D) to D. We explicitly compute the -limit, which is given by the functional E0rel on the 2-dimensional domain  defined by

E0rel(u, D) =

where u :   R3 is an elastic displacement field, which possibly allows a 1dimensional jump discontinuity set Su (with normal (u)), and D   is the shape of the void. Here W0 and 0 are explicit and W0qc is the quasiconvex envelope of W0. Moreover we obtain the recovery sequence subject to volume constraints on the voids.
The proof of Theorem 4.1 rests on the relaxation result complemented with volume constraints given in Theorem 3.1 for two phase energy functionals of the
form

E(y, D) =

W y(x) dx +

 (D) dHn-1,

\D

D

where   Rn is the reference configuration, y :   Rm and D  . The relaxed functional is defined on (a subset of) the space of generalized special functions of
bounded variations GSBV (; Rm) and it is, roughly, of the form

Erel(y, D) =

W qc y dx + 2

((y)) dHn-1 +

((D)) dHn-1,

\D

Sy \D

where y has jump discontinuities along the codimension one set Sy with normal (y) and W qc denotes the quasiconvex envelope of W . This relaxation result has
been first proved in [BCS07]. We also mention that in [FFLM11] a strongly related relaxation result in two dimensions is obtained. A main motivation for such results
has derived from investigations on epitaxially strained films [BC02, CS07]. We refer
to [CF20] for latest results and a detailed account of the literature in that direction. Below we provide a novel proof of Theorem 3.1: Instead of applying slicing
techniques we give a considerably simpler and short direct argument which provides
the lower bound estimate lim infk E(yk, Dk)  Erel(y, D) whenever yk  y, Dk  D with the help of a carefully chosen comparison functional of "Griffith type" (see below). We also include a detailed construction of the recovery sequences, which is briefly sketched in [BCS07, Remark 13]. The argument relies on the possibility of
choosing one-sided smooth approximations of sets of finite perimeter, which has only
recently been established in [CT17]. Moreover, we will prove that Erel(y, D) can be realized as a limit limk E(yk, Dk) with yk  y, Dk  D and Ln(Dk) = ck for any preassigned (positive) sequence ck with ck  Ln(D). In particular, if Ln(D) = 0 we thus obtain -convergence to a pure Griffith type fracture functional of the form

We finally would like to point out that in the present contribution we focus on
a situation with one of the phases being degenerate and Lagrangian surface energies that are given in the reference configuration. By way of contrast, models with
non-degenerate bulk elasticity and jump contributions measured in the deformed
configuration have been proposed in [S10, S11] and analyzed in [GKMS20]. Lagrangian models appropriately measure surface contributions, which on a molecular
level result from boundary layers forming within the elastic matrix in the vicinity
of voids even for large deformations. On the other hand they can describe Eulerian surface tensions as in fluids only for moderate strains. An interesting question that
is beyond the scope of this paper is, to what extend our analysis can be extended to general Lagrangian-Eulerian surface energies. We finally remark that in our theory
both variable and fixed volume fractions of the two phases can be considered. This
allows to describe the possibility of phase transformations as well as mixtures of different materials like alloys.

2 Functions of bounded variation

We collect some basic material on generalized functions of bounded variation and sets of finite perimeter. For an exhaustive treatment of this subject we refer to
[AFP00]. We fix a norm  on Rn and write | · | for the Euclidean norm. The dual norm of  is denoted

(u) = max{ u, v : (v)  1} for u  Rn.

Let   Rn be an open bounded set, u :   Rm a Borel function and x  . We say that a  Rm is the approximate limit of u at x if

lim -nLn
0

{x



B(x) : |u(x) - a| > }

=0

for each  > 0, in which case we write u~(x) for a. If this limit does not exist we say that x belongs to the approximate discontinuity set Su.3 For every x   \ Su we say that A  Rm×n is the approximate differential of u at x   if

lim -nLn {x  B(x) : |u(x) - u~(x) - A(x - x)| > |x - x|} = 0
0

for each  > 0. In this case we write u(x) for A.

We say that a Borel subset S  Rn is countably Hn-1-rectifiable if there are

at most countably many C1 hypersurfaces of dimension n - 1 in  that cover Su up to an Hn-1 negligible set. If moreover Hn-1(S) <  then we say that S is

Hn-1-rectifiable.

A function u  L1(; Rm) is said to lie in the space BV (; Rm) of functions of

bounded variation if its distributional derivative Du is a finite Rm×n-valued Radon

measure. The total variation of u with respect to the Euclidean norm is denoted by

|Du|. We also need to consider the anisotropic total variation (Du) of Du with

respect to  for a function u  BV (): this is the Radon measure (Du) on 

given by

(Du)(B) =


B

Du |Du|

d|Du|

for B   Borel,

where

Du |Du|

is

the

|Du|-measurable function

satisfying

Du

=

Du |Du|

|Du|.

Setting

(Du) = + for u  L1() \ BV (), it follows from the Reshetnyak lower

semicontinuity theorem [AFP00, Theorem 2.38] that the function u  (Du)(U )
is lower semicontinuous in the L1(U ) topology for any open subset U of . If u  BV (; Rm), the approximate discontinuity set Su is a countably Hn-1 rectifiable set. The Lebesgue decomposition of Du turns out to be Du = uLn + Dsu
with u  L1(; Rm×n) and singular part Dsu. If moreover Dsu is concentrated on Su, we speak of a special function of bounded variation and write u  SBV (; Rm). If u  SBV (; Rm) for all   , we write u  SBVloc(; Rm).
A function u :   Rm is a generalized function of bounded variation, write u  GSBV (; Rm), whenever   u  SBVloc(; Rm) for every   C1(Rm) with supp   Rm. If m = 1 this is equivalent to uM = (u  M )  (-M )  SBV () for every M > 0. Moreover, for 1  p, q   we define (G)SBV p(; Rm) as
the space of functions u  (G)SBV (; Rm) for which u  Lp(; Rm×n) and
Hn-1(Su) <  and set (G)SBVqp(; Rm) = (G)SBV p(; Rm)  Lq(; Rm). In [DMFT05, Prop. 2.3] it has been noted that GSBV p(; Rm) is a vector space and
that u = (u1, . . . , um) belongs to GSBV p(; Rm) if and only if ui  GSBV p() for all i and that, as a consequence, the scalar results in [AFP00, Sect. 4.5] apply to show that for u  GSBV p(; Rm) still Su is an Hn-1 rectifiable set. If we fix an approximate unit normal vector field  of S, then Hn-1 a.e. point x  Su is an approximate jump point of u in the sense that there are distinct u+(x), u-(x)  Rm
such that

lim -nLn
0

{x  B(x)  H± : |u(x) - u±(x)| > }

=0

for each  > 0, where H± = {x   : ±(x - x) · (x) > 0}. With little abuse of notation we denote each vector field  as above with (u); notice that the triple ((u)(x), u+(x), u-(x)) is uniquely determined up to a sign and a permutation. Setting uM = (uM 1 , . . . , uM m ) one has Su = M>0 SuM and
ui = uM i Ln a.e. on {|ui|  M }
for i = 1, . . . , m. The existence of one-sided traces u± is guaranteed on any countably Hn-1 rectifiable set oriented by some normal field. We also note that GSBVp (; Rm) = SBVp (; Rm) and that Su is the complement of the set of Lebesgue points of u if u  L(; Rm).
If E  Rn is a Borel subset then its measure theoretic interior E1, exterior E0 and boundary E are given by

E1

= {x  Rn

: lim -nLn

B(x) \ E

= 0},

E0 = {x  Rn : lim -nLn B(x)  E = 0},

E = Rn \ (E1  E0),

which are easily seen to be Borel subsets. If E   is a Borel set, then we say that E is a set of finite perimeter in  if and only if E  BV ().

for each Borel subset B  . We proceed to state the relevant compactness and lower semicontinuity re-
sults. The basic compactness theorem in (G)SBV p of Ambrosio is the following, cf. [Amb90, Amb95, AFP00]:
Theorem 2.1. Let   Rn be a bounded open set und (uk)  GSBVqp(; Rm) for p > 1 and q  1. Suppose that
uk Lq(;Rm) + uk Lp(;Rm×n) + Hn-1(Suk )  C
for some constant C > 0. Then there exists a subsequence (not relabeled) and a u  GSBVqp(; Rm) such that
(i) uk  u Ln a.e. and, in case q > 1, in L1(; Rm) (strongly),
(ii) uk  u in Lp(; Rm×n) (weakly) and
(iii) lim infk0 Hn-1(Suk )  Hn-1(Su).
For the lim inf inequalities we will make use of lower semicontinuity results. In particular, the lower semicontinuity of the bulk term follows from Kristensen's theorem in [Kri99].
Theorem 2.2. Let p > 1. Suppose that f : Rm×n  R is quasiconvex with -C  f (X)  C|X|p + C for all X  Rm×n and for some constant C > 0. Suppose   Rn is a bounded open set and (uk)  GSBV1p(; Rm) is such that
uk Lp(;Rm×n) + Hn-1(Suk )  C
for some constant C > 0 and uk  u in L1(; Rm). Then

f (u) dx.


For the surface part we use the following standard result in the SBV setting, see [AB90, Amb90, Amb94] and cf. [AFP00, Theorem 5.22]. We recall that for a compact set K  Rm a function g : K × K × Rn  [0, ) is jointly convex, if

g(x, y, ) = sup (Vh(x) - Vh(y)) · 
hN
for a suitable choice of Vh  C(K; Rn), h  N. For later use we remark that in the isotropic case g(x, y, ) = g(x, y)|| this amounts to requiring

g(x, y) = sup |Vh(x) - Vh(y)|
hN
for suitable Vh  C(K), h  N, while for functions g(x, y, ) = g() only depending on the crack normal this is equivalent to having g even, positively 1-homogeneous and convex.
Theorem 2.3. Let p > 1, K  Rm compact and suppose that g : K × K × Rn  [0, ) is jointly convex with g(x, y, )  c|| for a constant c > 0 and all (x, y)  K2 with x = y and   Rn. Suppose   Rn is a bounded open set and (uk)  SBV p(; Rm) is such that
uk Lp(;Rm×n)  C and uk  K Ln a.e.
for all k and some constant C > 0 and uk  u in L1(; Rm). Then

For the basic density result in SBVp we define the set W(; Rm) to be the space of functions y  SBV (; Rm) such that
(i) Hn-1(Sy \ Sy) = 0,
(ii) Sy   is the intersection of  with a finite union of (n - 1)-dimensional simplices,
(iii) y  W k,( \ Sy; Rm) for every k  N.
The following density result is a special case of the main result of [CT99].
Theorem 2.4. Let  be a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary. For every u  SBVp (; Rm) there exists a sequence (uk)  W(; Rm) with supk1 uk  <  and
(i) uk  u in L1(; Rm),
(ii) uk  u in Lp(; Rm×n) and uk(x)  u(x) for Ln a.e. x  ,
(iii) Suk ((uk)) dHn-1  Su ((u)) dHn-1,
(iii') ((uk)) · Hn-1 Suk  ((u)) · Hn-1 Su as Radon measures on .
Proof. The existence of a sequence satisfying (i), (ii) and (iii) follows from [CT99, Theorem 3.1 and Remark 3.2]. This sequence also satisfies (iii'), as can be checked with the help of the Portmanteau theorem and combining (iii) with the fact that, due to Theorem 2.3,

While this and related results have been widely used in Gamma convergence
and relaxation results, for the sets in F () will make use of a particular almost one-sided smooth approximation scheme, that has been rather recently established
in [CTZ09, CT17]. We define

C() = A   : A  Rn open with smooth boundary, Hn-1(A  ) = 0 .

In the next theorem we summarize all statements on smooth approximation of sets of finite perimeter needed in the sequel.

Theorem 2.5. Let E  Rn be a bounded set of finite perimeter, s > 0 and let K  Rn be a Borel set with Hn-1(K) < . There exists a sequence of open sets Ek with smooth boundaries such that for every Radon measure µ on Rn with µ  Hn-1 and each r > 0:
(i) Ln(EkE)  0, (ii) (DEk )(Rn)  (DE)(Rn) and (DEk )  (DE),
(iii) |µ| (E1  E)Ek  0,
(iv) Hn-1(Ek  K) = 0 for every k,
(v) {x  E : dist(x, Rn \ E) > r}  k mk Em, (vi) {x  Rn \ E : dist(x, E) > r}  k mk(Rn \ Em),

6

(vii) {x : dist(x, Rn \ E)  s}  Ek  {x : dist(x, E) < 2s} for every k.

Proof. We fix a sequence k  0, we define uk = E  k with the standard scaled mollifier  and we set Ftk = {uk > t} for t  (0, 1). Since uk  E in L1() and |Duk|(Rn)  |DE|(Rn) (see [AFP00, p. 121]), one has that Ln(FtkE)  0 for all t  (0, 1) and

lim

(Duk)(Rn)

by the Reshetnyak continuity theorem [AFP00, Theorem 2.39]. Moreover it follows from the lower semicontinuity of the anisotropic total variation that for every open
set U  Rn

(DE )(Rn ).

Passing to a t-dependent subsequence that realizes the lim inf as a limit and using

the Portmanteau theorem we also conclude that (DFtk )  (DE) for almost every t  (0, 1) along that sequence. Since Hn-1(K) < , we infer that Hn-1(Ftk K) = 0 for every k  1 and for all but countably many t  (0, 1). Moreover

it is proved in [CT17, Theorem 3.1] that |µ| (E1  E)Ftk  0 for all t

3 Bulk model and relaxation

We consider a bounded open set   Rn with Lipschitz boundary, mappings y  W 1,p(; Rm), 1 < p <  and subsets D   which are of finite perimeter within
 (or even more regular). The physically most relevant choice is n = m = 3. Here
y is a deformation mapping and D is a soft inclusion within an elastic body whose reference configuration is   R3.
We associate to y  W 1,p(; Rm) and any set D   of finite perimeter an energy

E(y, D) =

W (y) dx +

((D)) dHn-1.

\D

  D

Here the first summand on the right hand side is the elastic bulk energy with a stored energy function W , a Borel function which satisfies the growth condition

c¯|X|p - C¯  W (X)  C¯(1 + |X|p)

(2)

for constants c¯, C¯ > 0 and the second contribution quantifies the phase transition surface energy with an arbitrary norm  on Rn for which, by adjusting c¯ and C¯,

7

we can assume c¯|v|  (v)  C¯|v| for each v  Rn. The quasiconvex envelope W qc of W (cf. [Dac08]) satisfies the same growth condition.
Our first result identifies the relaxation of E with respect to L1 convergence of y and D. It also allows for volume constraints and provides smooth recovery sequences.
Theorem 3.1. The (L1-)relaxation of E on GSBV1p(; Rm) × F () is given by

Erel(y, D) =

W qc(y) dx+2

((y)) dHn-1 +

((D)) dHn-1.

\D

Sy D0

More precisely,

(i) whenever (yk)  W 1,p(; Rm) and (Dk)  F () are such that yk  y in L1(; Rm) and Dk  D in L1() for some y  GSBV1p(; Rm) and D  F (), then one has

Remark 3.2. The Lipschitz regularity of the boundary  is needed in the construction of the recovery sequence. The statement in 3.1(i) holds for every bounded open set . Remark 3.3. Cracks outside of D can develop as a result of asymptotically thin tubular neighborhoods of Sy  D0 whose boundary area is asymptotically twice as big as the surface area of Sy  D0, which explains the factor 2 occuring in the first surface term in Erel(y, D). Indeed, our proof will show that for every energetically optimal `recovery' sequence (yk, Dk )  (y, D) in L1(; Rm) × L1() such that limk E(yk, Dk) = Erel(y, D), one has
(DDk )  2((y)) · Hn-1 (Sy  D0) + (DD)
as Radon measures on . In fact, as shown in the proof of Theorem 3.1(i) (see also Remark 3.2) on each open subset U   we readily obtain

Since E(rel)(y, D) = E(rel)(\Dy, D), the following compactness statement complements Theorem 3.1.
Proposition 3.4. If p, q > 1 and (yk, Dk)  W 1,p(; Rm) × F () is a sequence with

E (yk, Dk) + yk Lq(;Rm)  C
then there is a (y, D)  GSBVqp(; Rn) × F () such that y = \Dy and, for a subsequence,

\Dk yk  \Dy in L1(; Rm) and Dk  D in L1().
We will henceforth denote by c, C > 0 generic, k-independent constants whose value might change from one occurrence to the next.

Proof. This is a direct consequence of the Compactness Theorem 2.1: As (Dk) 

F () with Hn-1(  Dk)  C/c¯ we immediately get a subsequence (not rela-

beled) such that Dk  D in L1() for some D  F (). SBV p(; Rm) and, by the growth condition (2),

Moreover, \Dk yk

\Dk yk = \Dk · \Dk yk  \D y in L1(; Rm). This proves the claim.

Remark 3.5. 1. Without any additional bound on yk, the control of the energy alone is not sufficient to guarantee compactness in GSBV as the specimen may fracture into pieces and mass might escape to infinity. Remarkably, in such a
situation one can still obtain compactness modulo rigid motions subordinate to a Caccioppoli partition of the domain, cf. [Fri19].

2. In physical applications with a bounded region containing yk() one has yk L(;Rm)  C. The energy bound E(yk, Dk)  C then leads to a limiting
deformation y  SBVp (; Rm).

Proof of Theorem 3.1(i). We GSBV1p(; Rm) × F () and that yk  y in L1(; Rm) and

By passing to W - W qc(0) we may without loss of generality assume that

W qc(0) = 0. We fix a constant cy  Rm such that

Hn-1 {x  D : y+(x) = cy} + Hn-1 {x  Sy : {y+(x), y-(x)}  cy} = 0,

where y± denotes the traces of y on Sy, respectively, D and, in particular, y+ is the outer trace of y on D. We also define the functions y~k  SBV1p(; Rm) by
y~k = \Dk (yk - cy)

The construction of recovery sequences is first provided for mappings y  W(; Rm) and sets D  C() (see Section 2). The general case is then achieved by approximation with the help of suitable density theorems. Here a subtle point is that it is not clear a priori that one may pass to a limit yk  y and Dk  D simultaneously. We overcome this difficulty by passing to the limits consecutively. This allows for an application of the standard approximation result in SBVp by Cortesani-Toader, but then requires a more subtle approximation procedure within F in terms of one-sided smooth approximations, cf. Theorem 2.5 and cp. [CTZ09, CT17].
We start with the following general fact on the asymptotic behaviour of the area of tubular neighbourhoods around certain sufficiently regular Borel sets. For every E  Rn and r > 0 we write E(x) = inf{(y - x) : y  E} for x  Rn,
Ur(E) = {x  Rn : E(x) < r}
and note that Ur(E) = {x  Rn : E(x)  r}  Ur(E) for every r > 0 and that E is a Lipschitz function. Combining the anisotropic coarea formula in (1) with results on the outer Minkowski content, see [LV16], we prove in the next Lemma a key estimate for the construction of the recovery sequence.

We notice4 that (E (x)) = 1 for Ln a.e. x  Rn \ E. Therefore we can use the anisotropic coarea formula in (1) with E and (Ur(E) \ E)  B to compute

4Evidently it holds |E(x) - E (y)|  (x - y) for all x, y  Rn, whence we deduce that E (x), v  1 if E is differentiable at x  Rn and (v) = 1. Moreover if E is differentiable at x  Rn \ E and a  E with (x - a) = E (x), then E (x + t(a - x)) = E(x) - tE (x) and,

differentiating this equality in t = 0, we obtain E (x), x - a = E (x). Therefore we conclude that (E (x)) = 1 for Ln a.e. x  Rn \ E.

Remark 3.7. The condition Hn-1(E) <  is not necessary. It is enough to assume that E is countably Hn-1 rectifiable and there exists c > 0 and a Radon measure  on Rn absolutely continuous with respect to Hn-1 such that (Br(x))  crn-1 for every x  E and r  (0, 1); see [LV16, Theorem 4.4 and Remark 4.2].
Proof of Theorem 3.1(ii). We proceed in consecutive steps.
Step 1. Firstly we treat the case y  W(; Rm) and D  C(), where D = A   with A  Rn open with smooth boundary such that Hn-1(A  ) = 0. Suppose that 0 < ck  Ln() with limk ck = Ln(D). We define E = ASy and we notice that E0 = Rn \ A, E = A and E = A  (Sy \ A) and Hn-1(E  ) = 0. In particular it follows from Lemma 3.6 that there exists a positive sequence k  0 such that

lim 
k

DUk (E)

()  c

with D ((A)) dHn-1 + 2 Sy\D ((y)) dHn-1 := c. If D = , then we need

to select a further subsequence (not relabeled) of (k) such that k  ck. Notice

of

 E in L1(Rn). Approximating the sets Uk (E Theorem 2.5, we find a sequence (Ek) of open sets

) with in Rn

boundaries such that Hn-1(Ek  ) = 0 for every k  1, Ek  E in L1(Rn),

Uk/2(E)  Ek  U3k/2(E) and

lim 
k

DEk

()  c.

(5)

It follows that

Ln(Ek  ) = Ln(D) + O(k).

(6)

Now, if D = , fix x0   \ E and, if D = , y0  D. Then set E~k = Ek  Bk (x0) \ Bk (y0)

with null sequences k, k  0 such that Bk (x0)   \ E, B2k (y0)  D and, writing n = Ln(B1) and noticing that Ln(Ek  ) - ck  0,
Ln(Ek  ) - ck = nkn - nkn for all k sufficiently large. If D =  this choice is possible with k = 0 (and Bk (y0) = ) for every k as in this case Ln(Ek )-ck = O(k)-ck by (6) and k  ck. In case D =  we understand that Bk (x0) =  and use that ck  Ln() by assumption. The modified sets E~k still satisfy

lim 
k

(7)

by (5) and E~k  E in L1(Rn) with

Ln(E~k  ) = Ln(Ek  ) + nkn - nkn = ck

for k sufficiently large enough, as then Bk (x0)  Ek =  and Bk (y0)  Ek. Finally, in view of standard relaxation results, see e.g. [Dac08, Theorems 9.8
and 12.14], we can choose y~k  C(; Rm) such that y~k  y in L1(; Rm) and

W (y~k) dx

Choosing yk = ky~k, where k  C(Rn) is a cut-off function with 0  k  1 on Rn and k = 0 on Bk (y0) and k = 1 on Rn \ B2k (y0), and also using (2) and (6), we obtain

while still yk  y in L1(; Rm). Combining with (8) and (7) and setting Dk = E~k   we find that indeed

lim sup E(yk, Dk)  Erel(y, D),
k

which concludes the proof of Step 1.

Step 2. Next we consider (y, D)  GS bounded set A with smooth boundary

We notice that for the functions yk = (y1k, . . . , ynk) with cut-off components

lim Erel(yk, D) = Erel(y, D).
k
Therefore we can assume y  SBVp (; Rm) and in view of Step 1, by invoking a diagonal sequence argument, it is now sufficient to provide a sequence (yk, Dk)  W(; Rm)×C() such that (yk, Dk )  (y, D) in L1(; Rm)×L1() with Ln(Dk) = Ln(D) for each k  1 and

lim sup Erel(yk, Dk)  Erel(y, D).

(9)

k

We choose approximations yk  y in L1(; Rm) as in Theorem 2.4. If D =  we immediately obtain (9) with Dk = D = . In case D = , arguing as in Step 1 with the help of Lemma 3.6 and Theorem 2.5 we find a positive sequence

k  0 and a sequence (Ak) of open subsets of Rn with smooth boundaries such

whence we can easily obtain the sequence satisfying (9). Step 3. In this crucial step we consider the case (y, D)  GSBV1p(; Rm) × F () such that both D and  \ D have nonempty interior. We have to provide a sequence Dk  C() with Ln(Dk) = Ln(D) such that

To this end, we first extend the set D to a set E with E   = D in such

a way that Hn-1(E  ) = 0 following the procedure outlined in [AFP00,

Remark 3.43]: since  is a Lipschitz domain, the function D can be extended to

a mapping f  BV (Rn) with compact support such that |Df |() = 0. We note

that for a.e. choice of s  (0, 1) the set Fs = {x  Rn : f (x) > s} is of finite

perimeter and satisfies

|Df |() = We then

c-h oo|sDe aFns

Hn-1(Fs  ) = |DFs |() = 0 by the coarea |() ds. Fixing such an s we set E = Fs. approximating sequence Ek for E as in Theorem

formula 2.5 such

that Hn-1(Ek  ) = 0 for every k  N. We fix x0  int( \ D), y0  int D and

set  = min{dist(x0, (Rn \ )  E), dist(y0, Rn \ D)} and

Dk = (Ek  )  Bk (x0) \ Bk (y0)  C(),
where 0  k, k  /2 with k  0, k  0 are chosen such that n(kn - kn) = Ln(D) - Ln(Ek  ) for large k. Since Bk (x0)  Ek =  and Bk (y0)  Ek   for k sufficiently large by Theorem 2.5(v)-(vi), this in particular yields Ln(Dk) = Ln(D) for all k large enough.
By Theorem 2.5(i) and dominated convergence we have

lim

W qc(y) dx =

Since Hn-1(E  ) = 0, then (DE)() = 0 and from Theorem 2.5(ii) we get

Step 4. For the general case (y, D)  GSBV1p(; Rm) × F () it is now sufficient to provide a sequence (Dk)  F () such that Ln(Dk) = Ln(D), int Dk = , int( \ Dk) =  and
lim Erel(y, Dk) = Erel(y, D).
k
Note that by Step 1 we may assume without loss of generality 0 < Ln(D) < Ln(). Fix x0  D0   and y0  D1 and notice that
Ln B(x0) \ D > 0 and Ln B(y0)  D > 0
for all  > 0. Therefore we can choose two sequences k  0 and k  0 such that
Ln Bk (x0) \ D = Ln Bk (y0)  D
and define Dk = (D  Bk (x0)) \ Bk (y0).
These sets evidently satisfy Dk  F () with Ln(Dk) = Ln(D) for large k. Moreover, we have
lim Erel(y, Dk) = Erel(y, D).

4 Membrane limits

In this section we fix p > 1,   R2 a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary and set k =  × (0, hk)  R3 for a sequence of `membrane heights' hk > 0 with hk  0. Also set  =  × (0, 1). To simplify the notation we make the following identifications:

GSBV p(; R3) = u  GSBV p(; R3) : 3u = 0, 3(u) = 0 , F () = D  F () : 3(D) = 0 .
Our goal is to analyse the asymptotic behaviour of the energy

Gk : W 1,p(k; R3) × F (k)  R

Gk(u, D) =

W (u) dx +

((D)) dH2

k \D

k   D

for (u, D)  W 1,p(k; R3) × F (k). The function W : R3×3  R is a continuous function which satisfies the growth assumption (2) and  is an arbitrary norm on

R3 as in the previous paragraph. To set the problem in the fixed domain  we apply

the usual rescaling k  (x first two columns or entries

, x3) of a

mat(rxix,,hr-ke1sxp3e)ctivel.y,(vWecetuorseaandprinimpeatroticduelnaortwe rtihtee

u = (u, 3u).) We then consider the rescaled functional

given by

Ek(u, D) =

W u, hk-13u dx +

 (D), h-k 13(D) dH2

for (u, D)  W 1,p(; R3) × F ().

for all (u, D)  W 1,p(; R3) × F (), where

0(v)  C¯|v| for each v  R2. Our main theorem for membranes is the following

(L1)-convergence result with possible volume constraints.

Theorem 4.1. The functionals Ek (L1)-converge to E0rel, in fact: (i) whenever (uk)  W 1,p(; R3) and (Dk)  F () are such that uk  u in L1(; R3) and Dk  D in L1() for some u  GSBV1p(; Rm) and D  F (), then one has

As for the bulk model, firstly we notice the following compactness property, which essentially follows from Proposition 3.4.
Proposition 4.2. If q > 1 and (uk, Dk)  W 1,p(; R3) × F () is a sequence with

Ek(uk, Dk) + uk Lq(;R3)  C,
then there exists (u, D)  GSBVqp(; R3) × F () such that u = \Du and , for a subsequence,

\Dk uk  \Du in L1(; R3)

and

Dk  D in L1().

Remark 4.3. Both in Theorem 4.1 and in Proposition 4.2 suitable loading terms can be included, e.g., given by some   Lp(; R3), p = p/(p - 1), acting on the elastic part of the body. Setting

L : W 1,p(; R3) × F ()  R, L(u, D) =

and the assertion follows from (10).

Proof of Theorem 4.1(ii). We proceed in two steps: Step 1 provides a key auxiliary statement that can be used together with Theorem 3.1(ii) and a standard diagonal sequence argument to construct the recovery sequence.
Step 1. Suppose (u, D)  C(; R3)×C(), c1, c2, . . .  (0, L2()] with ck  L2(D) and  > 0. We prove that there exists a sequence (uk, Dk)  C(; R3) × C() such that L2(Dk) = ck for each k  1, uk  u in L1(; R3), Dk  D in L1() and

lim sup Ek(uk, Dk × (0, 1))  E0(u, D) + .
k

We select x0   \ D, y0  D, two nonnegative sequences k  0 and k  0 and k0  1 such that Bk (x0)   \ D, Bk (y0)  D and
ck - L2(D) = 2k2 - 2k2
for all k  k0 (if D =  then we only select x0 and k, if D =  then we only select y0 and k). For each k  k0 we define Dk = D  Bk (x0) \ Bk (y0)  C() and notice that L2(Dk) = ck. Following [LDR95] we observe that a standard measurable selection criterion [ET76, Theorem 1.2 in Chap. VIII] in combination with the lower bound in (2) and the density of Cc( \ D; R3) in Lp( \ D; R3) allows us to choose w  Cc( \ D; R3) such that

W u, e3 + w dx 

W0(u) dx + .

\D

\D

We define the functions uk  C(; R3) by

uk(x, x3) = u(x) + x3hk(e3 + w(x))

for all (x, x3)   × R and for all k  1. Evidently uk  u in L1(; R3) and Dk  D in L1(). Since W is continuous, with the help of the dominated convergence theorem we infer

lim sup Ek uk, Dk × (0, 1)

which concludes Step 1. Step 2. Here we prove Theorem 4.1(ii). Let (u, D)  GSBV1p(; R3) × F () and c1, c2, . . .  (0, ) with ck  L2(D). Firstly we use Theorem 3.1(ii) to find a sequence (uk, Dk)  C(; R3) × C() such that L2(Dk) = L2(D) for each k  1, uk  u in L1(; R3), Dk  D in L1() and

lim sup E0(uk, Dk)  E0rel(u, D).
k

18

Then for each k  1 we use Step 1 to find a sequence (u(hk), Dh(k))  C(; R3)×C()

such that L2(Dh(k)) L1() and
