## Abstract

We revisit the Pseudo-Bayesian approach to the problem of estimating density matrix in quantum state tomography in this paper. Pseudo-Bayesian inference has been shown to offer a powerful paradign for quantum tomography with attractive theoretical and empirical results. However, the computation of (Pseudo-)Bayesian estimators, due to sampling from complex and high-dimensional distribution, pose significant challenges that hampers their usages in practical settings. To overcome this problem, we present an efficient adaptive MCMC sampling method for the Pseudo-Bayesian estimator. We show in simulations that our approach is substantially faster than the previous implementation by at least two orders of magnitude which is significant for practical quantum tomography.
