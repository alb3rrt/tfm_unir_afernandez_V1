Yamabe systems, optimal partitions, and nodal solutions to the Yamabe equation
M´onica Clapp, Angela Pistoia and Hugo Tavares June 2, 2021

Abstract
We give conditions for the existence of regular optimal partitions, with an arbitrary number   2 of components, for the Yamabe equation on a closed Riemannian manifold (M, g).
To this aim, we study a weakly coupled competitive elliptic system of  equations, related to the Yamabe equation. We show that this system has a least energy solution with nontrivial components if dim M  10, (M, g) is not locally conformally flat and satisfies an additional geometric assumption whenever dim M = 10. Moreover, we show that the limit profiles of the components of the solution separate spatially as the competition parameter goes to -, giving rise to an optimal partition. We show that this partition exhausts the whole manifold, and we prove the regularity of both the interfaces and the limit profiles, together with a free boundary condition.
For  = 2 the optimal partition obtained yields a least energy sign-changing solution to the Yamabe equation with precisely two nodal domains.

1 Introduction and statement of results

Consider the Yamabe equation Lgu := -gu + mSgu = |u|2-2u

on M,

(1.1)

where (M, g) is a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension m  3, Sg is its scalar curvature, g := divgg

is

the

Laplace-Beltrami

operator,

m

:=

m-2 4(m-1)

,

and

2

:=

2m m-2

is

the

critical

Sobolev

exponent.

We

assume

that the quadratic form induced by the conformal Laplacian Lg is coercive.

If  is an open subset of M , we consider the Dirichlet problem

Lgu = |u|2-2u in ,

u=0

on .

(1.2)

Let Hg1(M ) be the Sobolev space of square integrable functions on M having square integrable first weak derivatives, and let Hg1,0() be the closure of Cc() in Hg1(M ). The (weak) solutions of (1.2) are the critical points of the C2-functional J : Hg1,0()  R given by

J(u)

:=

1 2

(|g u|2g


+

m Sg u2)

dµg

-

1 2

|u|2 dµg.


The nontrivial ones belong to the Nehari manifold

N := {u  Hg1,0() : u = 0 and J (u)u = 0},

which is a natural constraint for J. So, a minimizer for J over N is a nontrivial solution of (1.2), called a least energy solution. Such a solution does not always exist. If  is the whole manifold M , it provides a

solution to the celebrated Yamabe problem. In this case its existence was established thanks to the combined

efforts of Yamabe [61], Trudinger [59], Aubin [3] and Schoen [44]. A detailed account is given in [39].

Set

c

:=

inf
uN

J(u).

In this paper, given   2, we consider the optimal -partition problem



inf
{1 ,..., }P

ci ,
i=1

(1.3)

where P := {{1, . . . , } : i =  is open in M and i  j =  if i = j}. A solution to (1.3) is an -tuple {1, . . . , }  P such that ci is attained for every i = 1, . . . , , and





ci
i=1

=

inf
{1 ,..., }P

ci .
i=1

We call it an optimal -partition for the Yamabe equation on (M, g).
Optimal partitions do not always exist. In fact, there is no optimal -partition for the Yamabe equation on the standard sphere Sm for any   2. This is because c is not attained in any open subset  of Sm whose

2

complement has nonempty interior. Indeed, by means of the stereographic projection  : Sm from a point q  Sm , problem (1.2) translates into
-u = |u|2-2u in (), u = 0 on [()].

{q}  Rm

It is well known that this problem does not have a least energy solution; see, e.g., [52, Theorem III.1.2]. Our aim is to give conditions on (M, g) which guarantee the existence of an optimal -partition for every
. To this end, we follow the approach introduced by Conti, Terracini and Verzini in [20, 21] and Chang, Lin, Lin and Lin in [13] relating optimal partition problems with variational elliptic systems having large competitive interaction.
We consider the competitive elliptic system



Lgui = |ui|2-2ui +

ij ij |uj |ij |ui|ij -2ui

j=1 j=i

on M,

i = 1, . . . , ,

(1.4)

where ij = ji < 0, ij, ij > 1, ij = ji, and ij + ij = 2. Firstly, we provide sufficient conditions for (1.4) to have a least energy solution with nontrivial components; secondly, in the case ij = ij and ij  , we study the asymptotic profiles of such solutions as   -. As a byproduct, we obtain the existence of
a regular optimal -partition of (1.3), and the existence of a sign-changing solution of (1.1) with two nodal
domains. Our results read as follows.

Theorem 1.1. Assume that one of the following two conditions holds true:

(A1) dim M = 3, (M, g) is not conformal to the standard 3-sphere and 2 < ij < 4 for all i, j = 1, . . . , .

(A2)

8 m-2

<

ij

<

2(m-4) m-2

for

all

i, j

=

1, . . . , 

if

m := dim M = 9.

Then, the system (1.4) has a least energy fully nontrivial solution (u1, . . . , u) such that ui  C2(M ) and ui > 0 for every i = 1, . . . , .

Note that, as ij

 (1, 2 - 1), it satisfies

8 m-2

< ij

<

2(m-4) m-2

when m > 9.

By a least energy fully

nontrivial solution we mean a minimizer of the variational functional for the system (1.4) on a suitable

constraint that contains only solutions with nonzero components, see Section 2 below.

Theorem 1.2. Assume that

(A3) (M, g) is not locally conformally flat and dim M  10. If dim M = 10 then

for every i = 1, . . . , .

(v) If  = 2, then u,1 - u,2 is a least energy sign-changing solution to the Yamabe equation (1.1). From Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 we immediately obtain the following results.

Theorem 1.3. Assume (A3). Then, for every   2 there exists an optimal -partition {1, . . . , } for

the Yamabe equation on (M, g) such that each i is connected and M

 i=1

i

is

the

union

of

an

(m - 1)-

dimensional C1,-submanifold of M and a closed subset whose Hausdorff measure is at most m - 2.

Theorem 1.4. Assume (A3). Then there exists a least energy sign-changing solution to the Yamabe equation (1.1) having precisely two nodal domains.

The main difficulty in proving Theorem 1.1 lies in the lack of compactness of the variational functional for

the system (1.4). Least energy fully nontrivial solutions are given by minimization on a suitable constraint,

but minimizing sequences may blow up, as it happens for instance when (M, g) is the standard sphere. To

prove Theorem 1.1 we establish a compactness criterion (Proposition 2.8) that generalizes the condition given

by Aubin for the Yamabe equation [4, Th´eor`eme 1]. To verify this criterion we introduce a test function

and we make use of fine estimates established in [26] to show that, under assumptions (A1) and (A2), a

minimizer exists.

The components of least energy fully nontrivial solutions to the system (1.4) may also blow up as the

parameters ij go to -. The standard sphere is again an example of this behavior. So, to prove Theorem

1.2, we establish a condition that prevents blow-up (see Lemma 4.2). To verify this condition we need

to estimate the energy of suitable test functions. Rather delicate estimates are required, particularly in

dimension 10 - where not only the exponents but also the coefficients of the energy expansion play a role -

leading to the geometric inequality stated in assumption (A3). These estimates are derived in Appendix A.

But the occurrence of blow-up is not the only delicate issue in proving Theorem 1.2. To obtain an optimal

-partition we need that the limit profiles of the components of the solutions to (1.5) are continuous. To this

end, we show that the components (un,i) are uniformly bounded in the -H¨older norm. This requires subtle

regularity arguments which are well known in the flat case, see e.g. [9, 41, 47, 52]. We adapt some of these

arguments (for instance, a priori bounds, blow-up arguments and monotonicity formulas) to obtain uniform

Ho¨lder bounds for general systems involving an anisotropic differential operator. This result (Theorem B.2)

is interesting in itself.

In order to prove the optimal regularity of the limiting profiles ui, the regularity of the free boundaries

M

 i=1

i

and

the

free boundary condition,

we use

local coordinates.

This

reduces

the

problem

to

the

study

of segregated profiles satisfying a system involving divergence type operators with variable coefficients. Using

information arising from the variational system (1.5), we deduce limiting compatibility conditions between

4

the ui's which allow to prove an Almgren-type monotonicity formula and to perform a blow-up analysis, combining what is known in case of the pure Laplacian [9, 47, 55] with some ideas from papers dealing with variable coefficient operators [30, 31, 37, 50]. This result (which we collect in a more general setting in Theorem C.1) is also interesting in its own right.
As we mentioned before, optimal -partitions on the standard sphere Sm do not exist. However, if one considers partitions with the additional property that every set i is invariant under the action of a suitable group of isometries, then optimal -partitions of this kind do exist and they give rise to sign-changing solutions to the Yamabe equation (1.1) with precisely -nodal domains for every   2; as shown in [18].
Already in 1986 W.Y. Ding [25] established the existence of infinitely many sign-changing solutions to (1.1) on Sm, and quite recently Ferna´ndez and Petean [28] showed that there is a solution with precisely  nodal domains for each   2. These results, as those in [18], make use of the fact that there are groups of isometries of Sm that do not have finite orbits. Looking for solutions which are invariant under such isometries allows avoiding blow-up. On the other hand, sign-changing solutions to (1.1) which blow-up along some special minimal submanifolds of the sphere Sm have been found by Del Pino, Musso, Pacard and Pistoia in [22, 23]. The existence of a prescribed number of nodal solutions on some manifolds (M, g) with symmetries having finite orbits is established in [17].
However, the existence of nodal solutions to the Yamabe equation (1.1) on an arbitrary manifold (M, g) is largely an open problem. In [2] Ammann and Humbert established the existence of a least energy signchanging solution when (M, g) is not locally conformally flat and dim M  11. Theorem 1.4 recovers and extends this result (see Remark 4.11). We also note that an optimal -partition {1, . . . , } gives rise to what in [2] is called a generalized metric g¯ := u¯2-2g conformal to g by taking u¯ := u1 + · · · + u with ui a positive solution to (1.1) in i. So Theorem 1.3 may be seen as an extension of the main result in [2].
We close this introduction with references to related problems. The study of elliptic systems like (1.4) with critical exponents in euclidean spaces has been the subject of intensive research in the past two decades, starting from [14­16]; without being exhaustive, we refer to the recent contributions [24,56] for a state of the art and further references. On the other hand, optimal partition problems is another active field of research: see for instance the book [7] for an overview on a general theory using quasi-open sets and other relaxed formulations. Particular interest has been shown when the cost involves Dirichlet eigenvalues (leading to spectral optimal partitions) both in Euclidean spaces (see for instance the survey [6,33] or the recent [1,42,57] and references therein), and in the context of metric graphs (see e.g. [34, 36] and references).

2 Compactness for the Yamabe system
We write · , · and | · | for the Riemannian metric and the norm in (M, g) and for v, w  Hg1(M ) we define

v, w g := ( gv, gw + mSgvw) dµg and
M

v g := v, v g,

where g denotes the weak gradient. Since we are assuming that the conformal Laplacian Lg is coercive, · g is a norm in Hg1(M ), equivalent to the standard one, and the Yamabe invariant

Yg :=

inf

uHg1(M )

u

2 g

{0} |u|2g,2

of (M, g) is positive. We write |u|g,r := M |u|r dµg 1/r for the norm in Lrg(M ), r  [1, ). Set H := (Hg1(M )) and let J : H  R be given by

J

-
i=1 j=i

ij ij |uj |ij |ui|ij-2uiv dµg,

v  Hg1(M ).

Hence, the critical points of J are the solutions to the system (1.4). Note that every solution u to the Yamabe equation (1.1) gives rise to a solution of the system (1.4) whose
i-th component is u and all other components are 0. We are interested in fully nontrivial solutions, i.e., solutions (u1, . . . , u) such that every ui is nontrivial. They belong to the Nehari-type set

N := {(u1, . . . , u)  H : ui = 0, iJ (u1, . . . , u)ui = 0, i = 1, . . . , }.

Define

c := inf J (u1, . . . , u).
(u1 ,...,u )N

A fully nontrivial solution u to (1.4) is called a least energy fully nontrivial solution if J (u) = c.

Remark 2.1. Since ij < 0, it is not hard to check that minimization of J on the classical Nehari manifold {(u1, . . . , u)  H {(0, . . . , 0)} : i iJ (u1, . . . , u)ui = 0} leads necessarily to solutions with only one nonzero component.

Proposition 2.2. If (u1, . . . , u)  N , then

i = 1, . . . , ,

where Yg is the Yamabe invariant of (M, g). Hence, N is a closed subset of H. Proof. Since ui = 0, iJ (u1, . . . , u)ui = 0, and ij < 0, we have that

For u = (u1, . . . , u)  H and s = (s1, . . . , s)  (0, ), we write su := (s1u1, . . . , su).

Proposition 2.3. Let u = (u1, . . . , u)  H.

(i) If

(ii) If there exists su  (0, ) such that suu  N , then su is unique and

Moreover, su depends only on the values

If ui = 0 for all i = 1, . . . , , then, as

we have that su  N iff s is a critical point of Ju. The statements (i) and (ii) follow immediately from [19, Lemmas 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3].

Remark 2.4. If  = 1, then N = {u  Hg1(M ) : u = 0,

Set T := {u  H : ui g = 1, i = 1, . . . , }, and let U := {u  T : su  N for some s  (0, )}.

Following [19, Proposition 3.1], it is easy to see that U is a nonempty open subset of T . Define  : U  R by
(u) := J (suu),
with su as in Proposition 2.3. This function has the following properties.
Proposition 2.5. (i)   C1(U, R).

(ii) Let un  U. If (un) is a Palais-Smale sequence for , then (sun un) is a Palais-Smale sequence for J .

Conversely, if (un) is a Palais-Smale sequence for J and un  N for all n  N, then

un un g

is a

Palais-Smale sequence for .

(iii) Let u  U. Then, u is a critical point of  if and only if suu is a fully nontrivial critical point of J . (iv) If (un) is a sequence in U such that un  u  U, then (un)  . Proof. The proof is identical to that of [19, Theorem 3.3].

Corollary 2.6. If u  N and J (u) = c, then u is a fully nontrivial solution to the system (1.4).

Proof. Since 

u ug

= infU  and U is an open subset of the smooth Hilbert manifold T , we have that

u ug

is a critical point of .

By

Proposition 2.5,

u

is

a critical point of J .

Recall that the operator Lg is conformally invariant, i.e., if g = 2-2g,  > 0, is a metric conformal to

g, then

Lg(-1u) = -(2-1)Lg(u)

u  Hg1(M ).

Since dµg = 2 dµg, we have that

-1u g = u g

and

|-1u|g,2 = |u|g,2

u  Hg1(M ).

7

So, changing the metric within the conformal class of g does not affect our problem.

Let Sm be the standard m-sphere and p  Sm. Since the stereographic projection Sm {p}  Rm is

a conformal diffeomorphism, the Yamabe invariant of Sm is the best constant for the Sobolev embedding

D1,2(Rm)  L2 (Rm),

m :=

inf

wD1,2 (Rm )

{0}

w2 |w|22

,

where D1,2(Rm) := {w  L2(Rm) : u  [L2(Rm)]m} equiped with the norm w := Rm |w|2 1/2, and |w|2 is the norm of w in L2(Rm). It is well known that

m

=

m(m - 4

2)

m2/m,

where m denotes the volume of Sm [3, 53]. It is shown in [19, Proposition 4.6] that c = infN J is not attained if M = Rm. Therefore, from the
previous paragraph, c is also not attained if M is the standard sphere Sm. Our aim is to investigate whether this infimum is attained in some other cases, at least for some values of ij and ij.
To this end, we establish a compactness criterion for the system (1.4) that extends a similar well known criterion for the Yamabe equation [39, Theorem A]. The key ingredient is the following result of T. Aubin.

Theorem 2.7 (Aubin 1976). For every  > 0 there exists C > 0 such that

m|u|2g,2  (1 + ) |gu|2 dµg + C u2 dµg

For each Z  {1, . . . , }, let (SZ ) be the system of  - |Z| equations



Lgui = |ui|2-2ui + ij ij |uj|ij |ui|ij-2ui

(SZ )

j=i
i, j  {1, . . . , } Z,

on M,

where |Z| denotes the cardinality of Z. The fully nontrivial solutions of (SZ) are the solutions (u1, . . . , u)

of (1.4) which satisfy ui = 0 iff i  Z. We write JZ and NZ for the functional and the Nehari set associated

to (SZ ), and define

cZ

:=

inf
uNZ

JZ (u).

(2.1)

The following compactness criterion is inspired by [19, Lemma 4.10].

Proposition 2.8. Assume that

c < min

.

Then c is attained by J on N .

Proof. By Ekeland's variational principle and Proposition 2.5 there is a sequence (un) in N such that

J (un)  c and J (un)  0. Then, (un) is bounded in H and, after passing to a subsequence, un,i  u¯i

weakly in Hg1(M ), un,i  u¯i strongly in L2g(M ) and un,i  u¯i a.e. on M , where un = (un,1, . . . , un,). A

standard argument shows that u¯ = (u¯1, . . . , u¯) is a solution of the system (1.4).

To prove that u¯ is fully nontrivial, set Z := {i  {1, . . . , } : u¯i = 0}. As un  N and ij < 0 we have

that

The proof of the following regularity result is standard; see, e.g., [52, Appendix B]. We include it here for the sake of completeness.

Proposition 2.9. Let u = (u1, . . . , u)  H be a solution to the system (1.4). Then, ui  C2,(M ) for any   (0, 1) such that  < ij - 1 for all i, j = 1, . . . , .
Proof. Let s > 0 and assume that ui  L2g(s+1)(M ). Note that this is true if 2(1 + s) = 2. Fix  > 0. For each L > 0, define iL := min{usi , L}. Then g(uiiL) = (1 + s1{usi L}) iLgui and g(uii2L) = (1 + 2s1{usi L}) i2Lgui. So, since iJ (u)[uiiL] = 0 and ij < 0, for any K > 0 we have that

(1 + s)-1 |g(uiiL)|2 dµg  i2L|gui|2 dµg

where the last inequality is given by Theorem 2.7 and C1, C2 are positive constants independent of L and K. Since

we

may

fix

K

such

that

(1 + s)(K)(1 + )m-1

Then,

as

with C > 0 independent of L. Letting L   we get that M |g(usi+1)|2 dµg  2C. Hence, ui  Lg2(s+1)(M ). Now, starting with s such that 2(1 + s) = 2 and iterating this argument, we conclude that ui  Lrg(M ) for every r  1. Since ui is a weak solution of the equation
-gui = -mSgui + |ui|2-1 + ij ij |uj |ij |ui|ij-1 =: fi,
j=i
from elliptic regularity [39, Theorem 2.5] and the Sobolev embedding theorem [39, Theorem 2.2] we get that ui  C0,(M ) for any   (0, 1). Then, fi  C0,(M ) for any   (0, 1) such that  < ij - 1 for all j = i, and, by elliptic regularity again, we conclude that ui  C2,(M ) for any such .

3 The choice of the test function

To prove the strict inequality in Proposition 2.8 we need a suitable test function. We follow the approach of Lee and Parker [39].
Fix N > m. Given p  M , there is a metric g on M conformal to g such that

det gij = 1 + O(|x|N )

in g-normal coordinates at p; see [39, Theorem 5.1]. These coordinates are called conformal normal coordi-
nates at p.
Since the Yamabe invariant Yg is positive, the Green function Gp for the conformal Laplacian Lg exists at every p  M and is strictly positive. Fix p  M and define the metric g := G2p-2g on M := M {p}. This metric is asymptotically flat of some order  > 0 which depends on M . If m = 3, 4, 5, or (M, g) is
locally conformally flat, the Green function has the asymptotic expansion

Gp(x) = b-m1|x|2-m + A(p) + O(|x|)

in conformal normal coordinates (xi) at p, where bm = (m - 2)m-1 and m-1 is the volume of Sm-1. The

constant A(p) is related to the mass of the manifold (M , g). It follows from the positive mass theorems of

Schoen and Yau [45,46] that A(p) > 0 if the manifold (M, g) is not conformal to the standard sphere Sm and,

either m < 6, or (M, g) is locally conformally flat. In the other cases the expansion of the Green function

Gp involves the Weyl tensor Wg(p) of (M, g) at p; see [39, Section 6] for details.

For  > 0, let

U(x) := [m(m - 2)](m-2)/4

 2 + |x|2

(m-2)/2
,

written in conformal normal coordinates (xi) at p and, for suitably small r > 0, define

V,p(x) :=

bm |x|m-2 U (x)

bm rm-2 U

r

x |x|

if |x|  r, otherwise.

Note

that

U1 

(

x |x|2

)

=

|x|m-2 U (x).

So,

up

to

a

constant,

V,p

is

the

test

function

defined

in

[39,

Section

7].

Now set

V,p := GpV,p.

(3.1)

The following estimates were proved by Esposito, Pistoia and V´etois in [26, Proof of Lemma 1]. If m = 3, 4, 5, or (M, g) is locally conformally flat, then

(3.5)

From these estimates we derive the following result.

Lemma 3.1. Assume that (M, g) is not conformal to the standard sphere Sm. Then, there exist p  M and

C0 > 0 such that

if either m < 6 or (M, g) is l.c.f., if m = 6 and (M, g) is not l.c.f., if m > 6 and (M, g) is not l.c.f.

Proof. By Remark 2.4,

where

|V,p |2g,2

If m = 3, 4, 5, or (M, g) is locally conformally flat, the positive mass theorem ensures that A(p) > 0 for

any p  M , and from (3.2) we get that

(3.6)

Proof. We prove this statement by induction on . If  = 1 the system reduces to the Yamabe equation (1.1), and (3.6) is equivalent to Yg < m. This
inequality follows from Lemma 3.1 taking  small enough. Assume that the statement is true for every system (SZ ) with |Z|  1 (i.e., for every system of less than
 equations). Then, the proof of (3.6) reduces to showing that

c < min

cZ

+

1 m

:

|Z |

.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that Z = {}. By Proposition 2.8 and the induction hypothesis,

there exists (u1, . . . , u-1)  NZ such that JZ (u1, . . . , u-1) = cZ . By Proposition 2.9, each ui  C0(M ).

Let

Proof of Theorem 1.1. By Propositions 3.3 and 2.8, there is u = (u1, . . . , u)  N such that J (u) = c. Then, u¯ = (|u1|, . . . , |u|)  N and J (u¯) = c, and the result follows from Corollary 2.6, Proposition 2.9 and the strong maximum principle [39, Theorem 2.6].

4 Phase separation and optimal partitions

In

this

section

we

restrict to

the

case

ij

=

and

ij

= ji

=

2 2

=: .

Our

aim is

to

study

the

behavior

of least energy fully nontrivial solutions to the system (1.5) as   - and to derive the existence and

regularity of an optimal partition.

Let  be an open subset of M . As mentioned in the introduction, the nontrivial solutions of (1.2) are

the critical points of the restriction of the functional

J(u)

:=

1 2

u

2 g

-

1 2

|u|g2,2

to the Nehari manifold

N := {u  Hg1,0() : u = 0 and

u

2 g

=

|u|2g,2 }.

So, a minimizer for J on N is a solution of (1.2).

Note that J(u) :=

1 m

u

2 g

if

u



N.

Therefore,

c

:=

inf
N

J

Define

on

M

if i = j},

c

:= inf
(u1 ,...,u )M

1 m

 i=1

ui

2 g

.

Lemma 4.1. Assume there exists (u1, . . . , u)  M such that ui  C0(M ) and

1 m

ui

2 g

=

c .

i=1

Set i := {p  M : ui(p) = 0}. Then {1, . . . , } is an optimal -partition for the Yamabe problem on (M, g), each i is connected and Ji (ui) = ci for all i = 1, . . . , .

Proof. As ui is continuous and nontrivial, we have that i is an open nonempty subset of M and ui  Ni . Moreover, i  j =  for i = j because uiuj = 0. Therefore, {1, . . . , }  P.
To prove the last two statements of the lemma we argue by contradiction. If, say, 1 were the disjoint union of two nonempty open sets 1 and 2, then, setting u¯1(p) := u1(p) if p  1 and u¯1(p) := 0 if p  2, we would have that (u¯1, . . . , u)  M and

1 m



u¯1

2 g

+

ui

2 g

< c ,

i=2

contradicting the definition of c .

Similarly, if Ji (ui) > ci for some i, then there would exist vi  Ni with ci < Ji (vi) < Ji (ui). But

then

1 m

1 m

ui

which is again a contradiction. Hence, Ji (ui) = ci for all i = 1, . . . ,  and

i=1

This shows that {1, . . . , } is an optimal -partition and concludes the proof.
Lemma 4.2. Let n < 0 and un = (un,1, . . . , un,) be a least energy fully nontrivial solution to the system (1.5). Assume that n  - as n   and that un,i  0 for all n  N. Assume further that

c < min

(4.1)

Then there exists (u,1, . . . , u,)  M such that, after passing to a subsequence, un,i  u,i strongly in

Hg1(M ), u,i  0, and

c

=

1 m

 i=1

u,i

2 g

.

Moreover,

nun,jun,i  0 as n   whenever i = j.
M

(4.2)

Proof. To highlight the role of n, we write Jn and Nn for the functional and the Nehari set associated to

the system (1.5) and we define

cn

:=

inf
Nn

Jn.

14

Note that M  Nn for each n  N. Therefore,

1 m

un,i

2 g

=

cn



c

<



i=1

n  N.

So, after passing to a subsequence, we get that un,i  u,i weakly in Hg1(M ), un,i  u,i strongly in L2g(M ) and un,i  u,i a.e. on M , for each i = 1, . . . , . Hence, u,i  0. Moreover, as iJn(un)[un,i] = 0, we have that, for each j = i,

Fatou's lemma then yields

C -n

lim inf

|un,j| |un,i| dµg = 0.
M

Hence, u,ju,i = 0 a.e. on M whenever i = j. On the other hand, as iJn(un)[u,i] = 0 and un,i  0, u,i  0, we have that

un,i, u,i g 

un2,i-1u,i dµg.

M

So, passing to the limit as n   we obtain

u,i

2 g



|u,i |2g,2

i = 1, . . . , .

(4.3)

We claim that

u,i = 0 i = 1, . . . , .

(4.4)

To prove this claim, let Z := {i  {1, . . . , } : u,i = 0}. After reordering, we may assume that Z is either empty or Z = {k + 1, . . . , } for some 0  k < . Then, arguing as we did to prove (2.2), we get that

lim
n

un,i

2 g



mm/2

i  Z.

On the other hand, if i  Z, there exists ti  (0, ) such that

tiu,i

2 g

=

|tiu,i|2g,2 .

So we have that

(t1u,1, . . . , tku,k)  Mk. The inequality (4.3) implies that ti  (0, 1]. Therefore,

and un,i  u,i strongly in Hg1(M ) and L2g(M ), we obtain (4.2).

Lemma 4.3. Let n < 0 and (un,1, . . . , un,) be a solution to the system (1.5) such that un,i  0 and un,i  u,i strongly in Hg1(M ) as n  . Then (un,i) is uniformly bounded in L(M ) for all i = 1, . . . , . Proof. We write again Jn for the functional associated to the system (1.5). Note that, by Proposition 2.9, un,i  L(M ) for all n  N, i = 1, . . . , . Fix i  {1, . . . , }.
Let s  0 and set wn,i := u1n+,is. Since iJn(un)[u1n+,i2s] = 0 and ij,n < 0, we get that

where Cs, Cs and Cs are positive constants depending on s but not on n, Iterating this inequality, starting with s = 0, we conclude that, for any r  [2, ),

|un,i|2g,r  C¯r n  N,
where C¯r is a positive constant independent of n. Now, we fix 2R > 0 smaller than the injectivity radius of M . Since M is covered by a finite number of geodesic balls of radius R and un,i satisfies

Lgun,i  |un,i|2-2un,i

on M,

we derive from [32, Theorem 8.17] that (un,i) is uniformly bounded in L(M ), as claimed.

Lemma 4.4. For n < 0 such that n  - let (un,1, . . . , un,) be a solution to the system (1.5) such that un,i  0 and (un,i) is uniformly bounded in L(M ) for each i = 1, . . . , . Then, for any   (0, 1) there exists C > 0 such that
un,i C0,(M)  C n  N, i = 1, . . . , .

Proof. This is a particular case of Theorem B.1.

Lemma 4.5. Assume that (M, g) is not locally conformally flat, m  10, and there exists (u1, . . . , u-1)  M-1 such that ui  C0(M ), ui  0 and

(4.10)

Set i := {q  M : ui(q) > 0}. Then, i is open and i  j =  if i = j. Since (M, g) is not locally

conformally flat and m  4, there exists p  M such that the Weyl tensor Wg(p) at p does not vanish. After

reordering, we may assume that, either p  1, or p  M i=-11i.

First, we consider the case where p  1. If m = 10 we take p satisfying (4.9). Fix r > 0 suitably small

so that the closed geodesic ball centered at p is contained in 1 and let  : [0, )  R be a smooth cut-off

function

written in conformal normal coordinates around p, where V,p is the function in (3.1). If (M, g) is not locally conformally flat and m  7 the estimates (3.4) yield

Remark 4.6. The argument given above does not carry over to m < 10 or to the case where (M, g) is locally conformally flat. Indeed, as can be seen from identities (3.2), (3.3) and (3.4) and Lemma A.1, in these cases

with Cu1(p) > 0, for  small enough. Remark 4.7. If m = 10, then the following geometric conditions suffice to guarantee (4.9):

· For   3, inequality (4.9) holds true if |Wg(q)|g = 0 for every q  M , because for p  1 := {q  M :

Indeed, choosing p to be a minimum of u1, since u1 is a positive solution to the Yamabe equation

(1.1) we have

that

Lemma 4.8. Assume that (M, g) satisfies the following conditions:

(A4) (M, g) is not locally conformally flat and dim M  10. If dim M = 10, then there exist a positive

least energy fully nontrivial solution u¯ to the Yamabe equation (1.1) and a point p  M such that

u¯(p)

and,

in

19

Let n < 0 and un = (un,1, . . . , un,) be a least energy fully nontrivial solution to the system (1.5). Assume

that n  - as n   and that un,i  0 for all n  N. Then there exists (u,1, . . . , u,)  M

with u,i  C0,(M ) for every   (0, 1) such that, after passing to a subsequence, un,i  u,i strongly in

Hg1(M )  C0,(M ), u,i  0, and

c

=

1 m



u,i

2 g

.

i=1

Moreover,

nui,nuj,n  0 as n  
M

whenever i = j.

Proof. The proof is by induction on .

Let  = 2. Then u1 := u¯ satisfies the hypotheses of Lemma 4.5. Therefore, the inequality (4.1) holds true and Lemma 4.2 yields the existence of (u,1, . . . , u,)  M such that, after passing to a subsequence, un,i  u,i strongly in Hg1(M ), u,i  0, and

c

=

1 m



u,i

2 g

.

i=1

From Lemmas 4.3 and 4.4 we get that (un,i) is uniformly bounded in C0,(M ). Therefore, the family {un,i} is equicontinuous and, as un,i  u,i a.e. on M , the Arzela`-Ascoli theorem yields un,i  u,i in C0(M ).
Now, let   3 and assume that the statement holds true for  - 1. Then, by Remark 4.7, the hypotheses of Lemma 4.5 are satisfied and, consequently, (4.1) holds true for . The same argument we gave for  = 2 yields the result for .

Remark 4.9. Observe that to prove the previous lemma for , we need it to be true for  - 1, because the

inequality

(4.1)

must

hold

true

in

order

to

apply

Lemma

4.2.

Therefore,

the

inequality

u¯(p)

<

5 567

|Wg (p)|2g

is required for every   2.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. As pointed out in Remark 4.7, assumption (A3) implies (A4). Statements (i) and

(iii) follow immediately from Lemmas 4.8 and 4.1.

Proofs of (ii) and (iv) : These statements have a local nature. In local coordinates the system (1.5)

becomes


- div(A(x)ui) = fi(x, ui) + a(x) n|un,j ||un,i|-2un,i,

x  ,

j=1 j=i

where  is an open bounded subset of Rm, a(x) = |g(x)|, A(x) = |g(x)|(gkl(x)), and fi(x, s) := a(x)(|s|2-2s - mSg(x)s). As usual, (gkl) is the metric g in local coordinates, (gkl) is its inverse and |g| its determinant. This system satisfies assumptions (H1), (H2) and (H3) of Theorem C.1 in Appendix C. Statements (i) and (iii), which are already proved, yield assumptions (H4), (H5) and (H6). From Theorem C.1 we obtain that (ii) and (iv) hold true locally on M , hence also globally.
Proof of (v): If u  Hg1(M ) is a sign-changing solution of the Yamabe equation (1.1), then u+ := max{u, 0} = 0, u- := min{u, 0} = 0 and JM (u)[u±] = 0. Hence, u belongs to the set
EM := {u  NM : u+  NM and u-  NM }.

Moreover, as shown in [12, Lemma 2.6], any minimizer of JM on EM is a sign-changing solution of (1.1). For

every

u  EM ,

we

have

that

(u+, u-)  M2

and

JM (u) =

1 m

(

u+

2 g

+

u- 2g). Therefore,

inf
EM

JM

 c2 =

1 m

(

u,1

2 g

+

u,2 2g).

As u,1 - u,2  EM , it is a minimizer of JM on EM . Hence, it is a sign-changing solution of (1.1), as claimed.

20

Remark 4.10. As can be seen from its proof, Theorem 1.2 is true under assumption (A4) and, consequently, so are Corollaries 1.3 and 1.4. As noted in Remark 4.7, (A4) is weaker that (A3), but it requires some knowledge on the least energy solution to the Yamabe equation (1.1) having precisely two nodal domains.

Remark 4.11. In [2], Ammann and Humbert defined the second Yamabe invariant of (M, g) as

µ2(M, g) := inf 2(g)Vol(M, g)2/m,
g[g]

where 2(g) is the second eigenvalue of the operator m -1Lg and [g] is the conformal class of g. Using the variational characterization in [2, Proposition 2.1] one can easily verify that

inf
EM

JM

=

1 m

(m

µ2(M, g))m/2.

The invariant µ2(M, g) is not attained at a metric, but it is shown in [2] that, if (M, g) is not locally conformally flat and m  11, this invariant is attained at the generalized metric conformal to g which is given by a minimizer of JM in EM . So Corollary 1.4 recovers and extends this result.
Remark 4.12. It is interesting to compare our result with that proved by Robert and V´etois in [43] under assumptions which are complementary to ours. In fact, they establish the existence of a sign-changing solution to the subcritical perturbation of Yamabe equation

-gu + mSgu = |u|2-2-u on M,

which looks like the difference between a positive solution u0 to the Yamabe equation and a bubble. Their

result holds true either in the locally conformally flat case, or in low dimensions 3  m  9, or if m = 10

provided

u0(p)

>

5 567

|Wg (p)|2g

for

any

p



M.

An interesting open problem would be to show that under these assumptions a least energy sign-changing

solution to the Yamabe problem (1.1) does not exist, as suggested by Remark 4.6.

B Uniform bounds in H¨older spaces

In this appendix we prove Lemma 4.4. Since it does not require additional effort, we consider the more

general system


Lgui = hi(p, ui) + |uj |+1|ui|-1ui

in M, i = 1, . . . , ,

(B.1)

j=1 j=i

where (M, g) is a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension m  1,  < 0,  > 0, and hi : M × R  R is a continuous function satisfying |hi(p, s)|  C|s| for every p  M, |s|  1.
Lemma 4.4 is a particular case of the following result.

Theorem B.1. For each  < 0 let (u,1, . . . , u,) be a nonnegative solution to (B.1) such that {u,i :  < 0} is uniformly bounded in L(M ) for every i = 1, . . . , . Then, for any   (0, 1), there exists C > 0 such

that

u,i C0,(M)  C

for every  < 0, i = 1, . . . , .

27

In local coordinates, the system (B.1) becomes



-

div(A(x)ui)

=

-mSg (x)ui

+

hi(x,

|uj |+1|ui|-1ui

i = 1, . . . , ,

where  is an open subset of Rm, a(x) := |g(x)|, A(x) := |g(x)|(gkl(x)), (gkl) is the metric written in local coordinates, (gkl) is its inverse and |g| is the determinant of (gkl). Observe that the second order differential operator is uniformly elliptic and, since M is compact, a is bounded away from 0. Therefore, we end up with a system of the form


- div(A(x)ui) = fi(x, ui) + a(x) |uj|+1|ui|-1ui
j=1 j=i

in ,

i = 1, . . . , .

(B.2)

Let

Symm

 R m(m+1) 2

be

the

space of real symmetric

m × m matrices.

For

the

system (B.2)

we

prove the

following result.

Theorem B.2. Let  be an open subset of Rm,  > 0. Assume that

(H1) a  C0() and a > 0 in ,

(H2) A  C1(, Symm) and there exists  > 0 such that A(x),   ||2 for every x  ,   Rm,

(H3) fi :  × R  R is continuous and there exists c¯ > 0 such that |fi(x, s)|  c¯|s| for every x  , |s|  1, i = 1, . . . , .

For each  < 0 let (u,1, . . . , u,) be a nonnegative solution to the system (B.2), such that {u,i :  < 0} is uniformly bounded in L() for every i = 1, . . . , . Then, given a compact subset K of  and   (0, 1), there exists C > 0 such that

u,i C0,(K)  C for every  < 0, i = 1, . . . , .

We now show that Theorem 1.4 follows from Theorem B.2.

Proof of Theorem B.1. Arguing by contradiction, assume that {u,i :  < 0} is unbounded in C0,(M ) for some   (0, 1) and some i = 1, . . . , . Since, by assumption, this set is uniformly bounded in L(M ), there exist n  - and pn = qn in M such that un,i := un,i satisfies

|un,i(pn) - un,i(qn)| [dg(pn, qn)]



,

where dg is the geodesic distance in (M, g). As (un,i) is uniformly bounded in L(M ), this implies that dg(pn, qn)  0. Moreover, since M is compact, a subsequence satisfies pn  p¯ in M . Hence, qn  p¯. Now, in local coordinates around p¯ the system (B.1) becomes (B.2) with fi(x, s) := a(x)(-mSg(x)s + hi(x, s)). This is a contradiction to Theorem B.2.

Therefore, for the remainder of the appendix, our goal is to prove Theorem B.2. We follow very closely the proof of [47, Theorem 1.2], where the case A(x) = I was treated, mainly highlighting the differences that arise from having a divergence-type operator instead of the Laplacian.
We use the following notation for the seminorm in Ho¨lder spaces:

[u]C0,()

:=

sup
x,y

|u(x) - u(y)| |x - y|

.

x=y

28

B.1 Auxiliary lemmas
We present the following generalization of [10, Lemma 5.2], [49, Lemma 4.1] and [51, Lemma 2.2] to our setting. The first part of the lemma is required to treat the case   1, while the second part is needed for  > 1 (see the upcoming proof of Lemma B.6 for more details).
Lemma B.3 (Decay estimates). Let  be an open subset of Rm and A  C1(, Symm) be bounded in the C1-norm and such that there are 0 <  <  with ||2  A(x),   ||2 for all x   and   Rm. Let a0  A C1(,Symm). For any R > 0 satisfying B2R(0)   we have the following results:
1. Take C  1 and let u  H1(B2R(0))  C0(B2R(0)) be a nonnegative solution of
- div(A(x)u)  -Cu in B2R(0).
Then there exist constants c1, c2 > 0, depending only on m,  and a0, such that.

u L(BR(0))  c1 u e L(B2R(0)) -c2R C .

2. Take  > 0,   1, C  1 and let u  H1(B2R(0))  C0(B2R(0)) be a nonnegative solution of

- div(A(x)u)  -Cu +  in B2R(0).

Then there exists a constant c > 0, depending only on m,  and a0, such that

C

 L (BR (0))

u L(B2R(0)) + .

Proof. 1. For the first statement we follow closely the proof of [49, Lemma 4.1], which considers the case of a constant matrix. Define

m

z(x) :=

cosh

C L

i=1

with L := max{1, (a0m + )2}.

Observe that, for x  B2R(0),

where in the last inequality we used C  1 and the definition of L. Moreover, observe that there exist

c1, c2 > 0, depending on L (that is, on m, a0 and ), such that


z(x)  c1ec2|x| C

for every x  Rm.

Therefore, given x0  BR(0), by the comparison principle (which we can apply because C > 0) we have

u(x)

 z(x - x0)

u L(B2R(0))

c1ec2R C

in BR(x0).

29

Evaluating the previous inequality at x = x0 yields



u(x0)



m c1

e-c2R

C

u L(B2R(0)),

and the conclusion follows.

2. We follow the proof of [51, Lemma 2.2] (which deals with the the Laplace operator). Our main addition

is the use of the mean value theorem for divergence operators, which reads as follows: Given   Rm there

exist k, K > 0, only depending on ,  > 0, such that for y   there exists an increasing family of sets

Dr(y)   such that Bkr(y)  Dr(y)  BKr(y) and, for every solution w of - div(A(x)w)  0 in , we

have

r



1 |Dr(y)|

w
Dr (y)

is increasing, and

w(y)



1 |Dr (x0 )|

w.
Dr (y)

(See [5, Theorem 6.3] for the proof of this result, which was previously stated in [8, 11]). Now take a nonnegative solution v  H1(B2R(0)) of

- div(A(x)w) + Cw = 0 in B2R(0), v = u L(B2R(0)) on B2R(0).

Using the uniform ellipticity and since C > 0, we can apply the maximum principle to deduce that v  u L(B2R(0)) in B2R(0). Let   Cc(B2R(0)), 0    1 be a cut-off function such that  = 1 in B3R/2(0),
and take R(x) := (x/R). Then,

By the maximum principle we have that u  v + (/C)1/, from which the conclusion follows.

Lemma B.4 (Liouville-type results). Let A  Symm be a constant matrix and   (0, 1). 1. Let u, v  Hl1oc(Rm)  C0(Rm) be nonnegative functions satisfying uv  0 and - div(Au)  0, - div(Av)  0 in Rm.

If [u]C0,(Rm) <  and [v]C0,(Rm) <  then, either u  0, or v  0. 2. Let and u, v  Hl1oc(Rm)  C0(Rm) be nonnegative solutions of
- div(Au)  -auv+1, - div(Au)  -avu+1

in Rm,

with a > 0 and  > 0. If [u]C0,(Rm) <  and [v]C0,(Rm) <  then, either u  0, or v  0. 3. Let u be a solution of - div(Au) = 0 in Rm such that [u]C0,(Rm) < . Then u is constant.

30

Proof. Inspired by the proof of [49, Theorem 3.1], since A is symmetric and positive definite, there exist an orthogonal matrix O anda diagonal matrix D = diag(d1, . . . , d) with di > 0 such that OtAO = D. Then, for D := diag( d1, . . . , d) and u¯(x) := u(O Dx), we have
 u¯(x) = div(Au)(O Dx).
Under this change of variables, we reduce the proof of this lemma to the case of the Laplace operator. Therefore, parts 1 and 3 follow from [41, Proposition 2.2 and Corollary 2.3], while part 2 follows from [47, Lemma A.3] (see also [48, Corollary 1.14-(ii)] for the case   1).

B.2 A contradiction argument and a blow-up analysis

Fix   (0, 1). Without loss of generality, we assume that B3(0)  . Under the assumptions of Theorem B.2, we aim at proving the uniform Ho¨lder bound in B1(0). Fix  > 0 such that

u,i L(B3(0))     < 0, i = 1, . . . , .

Let   Cc1(Rm) be a radially decreasing cut-off function such that



(x) = 1

for x  B1(0),

((xx))

= =

0 (2

-

|x|)2

for x  Rm B2(0), for x  B2(0) B3/2(0).

(B.3)

For x  B2(0), let dx := dist(x, B2(0)). It is shown in [47, Remark 2.1] that

sup

sup supB(x)   16.

xB2(0) (0,dx/2) inf B(x) 

(B.4)

Our goal is to prove that there exists C > 0 such that

sup
x=y

|(un,i)(x) - (un,i)(y)| |x - y|



C

x,yB2(0)

  < 0, i = 1, . . . , .

(B.5)

Since  = 1 in B1(0), Theorem B.2 follows readily from (B.5). To prove (B.5) we argue by contradiction. Assume that (B.5) is false. Then there exist n  - such
that un,i := un,i satisfies

Ln := max
i=1,...,

sup
x=y

|(un,i)(x) - (un,i)(y)| |x - y|

-



x,yB2(0)

as n  .

(B.6)

We may assume that the maximum is attained at i = 1. Then, for each n, we fix a pair of points xn, yn 

B2(0) with xn = yn such that

Ln

=

|(un,1)(xn) - (un,1 |xn - yn|

)(yn)|

.

As (un) is uniformly bounded in L(B2(0)), this implies that |xn - yn|  0. So (xn) and (yn) converge to the same point. We denote

x

:=

lim
n

xn

=

lim
n

yn,

A := A(x),

The contradiction argument is based on two blow-up sequences

a := a(x).

(B.7)

un,i(xn + Lnrn

and

v¯n,i(x)

31

both defined in the scaled domain n := (B3(0) - xn)/rn; see [47, 51, 58, 60]. Here rn  (0, 1), rn  0, will be conveniently chosen later. Observe that B1/rn (0)  n, therefore n approaches Rm as n  . Since  is positive in B2(0), the functions vn,i and v¯n,i are nonnegative and nontrivial in n := (B2(0) - xn)/rn. Note that, as xn  B2(0), n approaches a limit domain  which is either a half-space or the whole Rm, as n  .

Lemma B.5. Under the assumptions of Theorem B.2, vn,i and v¯n,i have the following properties:

1.

The sequence of -Ho¨lder for every n  N,

3. There exist a0, a1, a2, ,  > 0 such that, for every n  N, a1  an(x)  a2 and ||2  An(x),   ||2 x  n,   Rm,

An C1(n,Symm)  a0. 4. gn,i L(n)  0, and there is c0 > 0 such that |gn,i(x)|  c0rn2 |vn,i(x)| for every x  n, n  N. 5. vn,i - v¯n,i L(K)  0 for any compact set K  Rm and every i = 1, . . . , . 6. For any compact set K  Rm there exists C > 0 such that

|vn,i(x) - vn,i(y)|  C + |x - y| x, y  K, i = 1, . . . , .

In particular, (vn,i) has uniformly bounded oscillation in any compact set.

Proof. The first two statements are proved by direct computation. The third one follows from (H1) - (H2) with a1 := minxB3(0) a(x), a2 := maxxB3(0) a(x),  := A C0(B3(0),Symm) and a0 := A C1(B3(0),Symm), while the fourth one is a consequence of (H3), (B.3), (B.6) and rn  0. The last two statements are proved exactly as those in [47, Lemma 2.2-(4),(5)].

Lemma B.6. Take rn  0+ such that

lim inf

|n|

and

lim sup

(B.8)

Then the sequence (vn(0)) is bounded in R, where vn := (vn,1, . . . , vn,).

32

Proof. We follow [47, Lemma 2.3], to which we refer for further details.

Assume by contradiction that |vn,¯i(0)|   for some ¯i  {1, . . . , }. Take R  |yn - xn|/rn for all

n  N. From Lemma B.5-1 we get that |vn,¯i(0)| = |v¯n,¯i(0)|  |v¯n,¯i(x)| + (2R) if x  n  B2R(0). So

inf nB2R(0) |v¯n,¯i(x)|  R is arbitrary, it follows

Since

Let   Cc(B2R(0)) be a nonnegative cut-off function such that  = 1 in BR(0). Take i = 1, . . . , .

where in the last inequality we used Lemma B.5-4, (H2) and Young's inequality. By Lemma B.5-3 we have

|n||vn,j |+1|vn,i|+1  C

(vn2,i + 1).

j=i BR(0)

B2R (0)

Combining this inequality with lim inf |n| > 0 and Lemma B.5-6 we deduce that

|vn,j (x)|2(p+1)|vn,i(x)|2(p+1)  C(|vn,i(x)|2 + 1)(|vn,j (x)|2 + 1) x  BR(0),

for every for i = j. Using again Lemma B.5-6 and our assumption that |vn,¯i(0)|   we derive

inf
B2R (0)

|vn,¯i|



,

sup |vn,i|  0 i = ¯i.
B2R (0)

Now we consider two cases. Assume first that   (0, 1] (as when 2( + 1) = 2 and m  5). There are again two possibilites:
Case 1. If ¯i = 1, take In := a1|n| infB2R(0) |vn,1|+1  . Then, since vn,i  0 in B2R(0) and   1, from Lemma B.5 we get that

- div(Anvn,i)



Crn2 vn,i

-

Invn,i



-

In 2

vn,i

in B2R(0),

i > 1,

Since An C1(n,Symm)  a0 for all n  N (by Lemma B.5-5), Lemma B.3-1 yields

0  vn,i  c1e-c2 In in BR(0),

and therefore


|n|Mnvn,+i 1vn,1  2Inc1e-c2(+1) In  0

in BR(0)

for n large, and

div(Anvn,i)  0 in L(BR(0)).

Then, setting wn(x) := vn,1(x)-vn,1(0), by the Ascoli-Arzel`a theorem we have that wn  w in L(BR(0)).
Moreover, An(x)  A(x) =: A with x as in (B.7). Observing that R may be taken arbitrarily large,
we conclude that div(Aw) = 0 in Rm.

33

Arguing as in as in [47, p. 401­402] and using (B.4), we see that [w]C0,(Rm) = 1, which contradicts Lemma B.4-3. Case 2. If ¯i > 1, take In := j>1 |n| infB2R(0) |vn,j |+1  . Then

- div(Anvn,1)



-

In 2

|v1,n|



-

In 2

|vn,1

in B2R(0).


Therefore, again by Lemma B.3-1, vn,1  c1e-c2 In in BR(0), which gives again

div(An(x)vn,1(x))  0 uniformly in BR(0),

a contradiction. Finally, if  > 1, one may argue exactly as in Case 1 of the proof of [47, Lemma 2.3], using this time
the decay estimate Lemma B.3-2. In both cases, ¯i = 1 and ¯i > 1, we end up with div(An(x)vn,1(x))  0 locally uniformly in Rm, leading as before to a contradiction.

Lemma B.7. Up to a subsequence, we have that

|n|

Ln (xn)

2
|xn - yn|2(+1)  

Proof. We follow [47, Lemma 2.5]. Arguing by contradiction, assume that the sequence considered in the statement is bounded and take

rn :=

|n|

Ln (xn)

2

-1/(2( +1))
 0.

With this choice we have that (B.8) is satisfied and from Lemma B.6 we deduce that (v¯n(0)) is bounded in R. Combining this fact with Lemma B.5-1, we deduce the existence of (v1, . . . , v)  C0,(Rm, R) such that v¯n,i  vi in the -H¨older norm as n  . Under the previous choice of rn one has n = -1. Hence, by elliptic regularity, the convergence of v¯n,i to vi is actually in C1,, and
- div(Avi) = -avi vj+1 in ,
j=i
where  is the limit domain of n and A, a are defined in (B.7). In particular, for any i = j, the pair (vi, vj) is a nonnegative solution of
- div(Avi)  -avi vj+1, - div(Avj )  -avj vi+1 in ,
having bounded -H¨older seminorm. Using Lemma B.4-2. and reasoning from this point on word by word as in [47, Lemma 2.5], we obtain a contradiction.
Lemma B.8. Let rn := |xn - yn|. Then there exists (v1, . . . , v)  C0,(Rm, R) such that, up to a subsequence,
(i) vn,i  vi in L loc(Rm)  Hl1oc(Rm) for all i = 1, . . . , ;
(ii) for any r > 0,

lim

|n||vn,i|+1|vn,j |+1 = 0

In particular, vivj  0 in Rm for every i = j.

i, j = 1, . . . ,  with i = j.

Proof. Using Lemmas B.5, B.6 and B.7, in particular the smoothness, boundedness and uniform ellipticity
of An, the proof is obtained from a straightforward adaptation of that of [47, Lemma 2.6] (which, in turn, is based on [41, Lemma 3.6])). Observe that vivj  0 is a direct consequence consequence of the strong convergence of vn, the convergence in (ii) and the fact that

Lemma B.9. Let (v1, . . . , v) be as in Lemma B.8 and A be as in (B.7). Then,

(i) maxxB1 |v1(x) - v1(0)| = 1 and div(Av1) = 0 in 1 := {x  Rm : v1(x) > 0}.

The set 1 is open and connected, and 1 = Rm. (ii) vi  0 in Rm for every i > 1.

Proof. Using the previous lemma together with Lemma B.4, the proof follows exactly as the one of [47, Lemma 2.7].

B.3 The domain variation formula. End of the proof

End of the proof of Theorem B.2. Since A  Symm is positive definite, there exist an orthogonal matrix

O and a diagonal matrix D = diag(d1, . . . , d) with di > 0 such that OtAO = D. Let







u1(x) := v1(O Dx), so that u1(x) = DOtv1(O Dx).

Then, from Lemma B.9 we get

· max |u1(x) - u1(0)| = 1,
| Dx|=1

· u1 = 0 in {u1 > 0}, which is an open connected set, that does not coincide with Rm;

(B.10)

for Z(x) := DOtY (O Dx). Since Y is an arbitrary vector field with compact support, then (B.10) holds

true for every Z  Cc1(Rm, Rm). Given x0  Rm and r > 0, let   Cc(Br+(x0)) be a cut-off function such that 0    1 and  = 1 in Br(x0). Then, taking Z(x) = Z(x) := (x - x0) in (B.10) and letting   0,

we derive the local Pohozaev identity

|u1|2 =

r(2( u1)2 - |u1|2)

Br (x0 )

Br (x0)

(see for instance [42, Corollary 3.16] for the details). From this, it is now classical to deduce an Almgren monotonicity formula, namely, if we set

E(x0, r)

:=

1 rm-2

|u1|2,
Br (x0)

N (x0, r)

:=

E(x0, H (x0 ,

r) r)

,

H(x0, r)

:=

1 rm-1

u21,
Br (x0)

then we have that H(x0, r) = 0 for every r > 0, the function r  N (x0, r) is absolutely continuous and

monotone nondecreasing, and

d dr

log H(x0, r)

=

2 r

N

(x0,

(see for instance [42, Theorem 3.21] for a proof). Moreover, if N (x0, r) =  for every r  [r1, r2], then u1 = ru1() in {r1 < r < r2}, where (r, ) denotes a system of polar coordinates centered at x0. Therefore

we have obtained precisely the statements contained in [47, Lemma 2.7 and Proposition 2.9]. From this

point on we argue exactly as in [47, Section 2.3] to obtain a contradiction.

C Lipschitz continuity of the limiting profiles and regularity of the free boundaries

Staying within the framework of Appendix B we continue our study of system (B.2). Our aim now is to prove the following result.
Theorem C.1. Let  be an open subset of Rm and  > 0. Assume that
(H1) a  C1() and a > 0 in ,
and that A and fi satisfy the assumptions (H2) and (H3) stated in Theorem B.2. For each  < 0, let (u,1, . . . , u,) be a nonnegative solution to the system (B.2) satisfying (H4) u,i  ui strongly in H1()  C0,() for every   (0, 1), as   -, where ui  0.

(H5) u,iu,j  0 whenever i = j; in particular, uiuj  0 if i = j.

(H6) - div(A(x)ui) = fi(x, ui) in the open set {x   : ui(x) > 0}. Then, the following statements hold true:

(a) ui is Lipschitz continuous for every i = 1, . . . , .
(b) the nodal set  := {x   : ui(x) = 0 i = 1, . . . , } is the union of two sets,  = R  S with R  S = , where R is an (m - 1)-dimensional C1,-submanifold of  and S is a relatively closed subset of  whose Hausdorff measure is smaller than or equal to m - 2. Moreover,

­ given x0  R, there exist i, j such that

lim
xx+ 0

A(x)ui(x), ui(x)

= lim A(x)uj (x), uj (x)
xx- 0

= 0,

where x  x±0 are the limits taken from opposite sides of R, ­ and, if x0  S , then

lim
xx0

A(x)ui(x), ui(x)

=0

for every i = 1, . . . , .

The proof of the Lipschitz continuity of the limiting profiles goes along the lines of [41, Theorem 1.2 and Section 4] (see also [47, Theorem 1.5-(4)], while the regularity of the nodal set follows [55, Theorem 1.1] (see also [47, Theorem 1.7]), where the differential operator is the Laplacian. The proof requires a careful blow-up analysis and is mainly based on the use of an Almgren-type monotonicity formula. Adapting it to divergence form operators with nonconstant matrices is not completely straghtforward, and for that we use ideas from [30, 31, 37, 50].

C.1 Almgren's monotonicity formula: the case A(0) = Id
Assume that 0   and, for now, that A(0) = Id. Our goal is to prove an Almgren monotonicity formula centered at the origin. Later on we shall see how to reduce the case where A(0) is any matrix to the one where A(0) = Id, and in which way this affects the formulas. The advantage of making this assumption stems from the fact that, near the origin, the problem looks like the one for the Laplacian, for which formulas are easier to derive. As in [31, 37, 50], we define

µ(x) :=

A(x)

x |x|

,

x |x|

,

x  Rm \ {0}.

37

The next lemma quantifies the behavior of various functions involving A as x  0, in terms of

DA  := max{ xkaij (x) L(), i, j = 1, . . . , , k = 1, . . . , m}
(which we assume to be finite, eventually by taking a smaller  from the start). The proof follows computations in [31]. Here, however, we need to keep track of the dependencies of the constants involved in the monotonicity formula. This is a key factor in passing from a general A to one with A(0) = Id (see the proof of Theorem C.9 below, and its relation with Theorem C.3).

Lemma C.2. There exists a constant C, depending only on the dimension m and on an upper bound for DA , such that, as |x|  0,

(by item 5.), we have that 7. follows from 3., 4. and 6.

The main purpose of this section is to prove the following result.

Theorem C.3 (Monotonicity formula, case A(0) = Id). Take    such that 0  . There exist C, r¯ > 0 (depending only on the dimension m, the ellipticity constant , the domain , and on an upper bound for
DA  and u ) such that, whenever r  (0, r¯), we have that H(r) = 0, the function N is absolutely continuous, and
N (r)  -C(N (r) + 1).

In particular eCr(N (r) + 1) is a non decreasing function and the limit N (0+) := limr0+ N (r) exists and is

We present here a sketch of the proof of this result, which is based in ideas from [41, 47, 55], with adaptations obtained from [30, 31, 37, 50] allowing us to deal with variable coefficients. Our main goal in carrying out this proof and in repeating some computations is to focus on the dependence of the constants C and r¯, specially on the matrix A, something that was not needed in previous papers.

Remark C.8. Observe that identities (C.2) and (C.7), which can be seen as local Pohozaev-type identities, are equivalent. They correspond to the condition (G3) for the Laplacian stated in [47] and [55] respectively.

Proof of Theorem C.3. This result now follows from standard arguments. Here, as before, we mainly verify the dependence of the constants. Within this proof, O(1) will represent a bounded function of r depending only on m, ,  and on an upper bound for DA  (but which is independent of u ). We have, by Lemma C.7,

By (H3), there exists d¯ depending on an upper bound for u  such that |fi(x, ui)|  d¯ui. This together

with assumption (H2) and Lemma C.2-2.-3., yields Z(x) = A(x)x/µ(x) = O(1)|x| as x  0 and

C.2 Almgren's monotonicity formula: the general case

We have proved a monotonicity formula under the assumption that A(0) = Id. The general case can be

reduced

to

this

case in

the

following way:

let

A(x0

)

1 2

be

the

square

root of

the

(positive

definite)

matrix

A(x0), that is, the unique positive definite matrix whose square is A(x0).

We

recall

that

A(x0

)

1 2

is also

symmetric,

it

commutes

with

A(x0),

it

has

real

entries

and

that

the

map

x0



A(x0

)

1 2

is

continuous

(see

for instance [35]). Following [30, 50], we set

Tx0 x

:=

x0

+

A(x0

)

1 2

x,

Ax0 (x)

:=

A(x0

)-

1 2

A(Tx0

x)A(x0

)-

1 2

,

µx0 (x) :=

Ax0

x |x|

,

x |x|

,

fx0 (x, s) := f (Tx0x, s), vi,x0 := ui(Tx0 x).

Observe that Ax0(0) = Id. Let now

N (x0, u, r)

:=

E(x0, H (x0 ,

u, u,

r) r)

,

43

where

E(x0, u, r)

:=

1 rN -2

Br (0)

Ax0 vx0 , vx0 - fx0 (x, vx0 ), vx0

dx

H(x0, u, r)

:=

1 rN -1

µx0 (x)|vx0 |2.
Br (0)

These quantities can be expresed in terms of the original function u in the ellipsoidal set

Er(x0) := {x  Rm :

|A(x0 )-

1 2

(x

-

x0)|

<

r}.

Namely, by a change of variables one has

Ax0 vx0 , vx0

=

det(A(x0)-

1 2

)

Au, u ,

Br (0)

Er (x0 )

fx0 (x, vx0 ), vx0

=

det(A(x0)-

1 2

)

f (x, u), u ,

Br (0)

Er (x0 )

µx0 (x)|vx0 (x)|2 d(x) =

bx0(y)|u(y)|2 d(y),

Br (0)

 Er (x0 )

where

bx0 (y)

:=

c(x0

,

y

)|A(x0

)-

1 2

(y

- x0)|-2

A(x0)-1A(y)A(x0)-1y, y

,

c(x0, y) being the dilation coeffi-

cient/tangential Jacobian (see for instance [40, Chapter 11]), which is continuous and positive.

Theorem C.9 (Monotonicity formula, general case). Take    and let u be as before. Then there exist
C, r¯ > 0 (depending on the dimension m, the ellipticity constant  and the domain , but independent
from x0) such that, whenever r  (0, r¯) and x0  , we have that vx0 satisfies identities (C.2) and (C.4), H(x0, u, r) = 0, the function r  N (x0, u, r) is absolutely continuous, and

 r

N

(x0,

u,

r)



-C(N

(x0,

u,

r)

+

1).

In particular, eCr(N (x0, u, r) + 1) is nondecreasing and the limit N (x0, u, 0+) := limr0+ N (x0, u, r) exists and is finite. Moreover,

 r

log

H (x0 ,

u,

r)

-

2 r

N

(r)

C

for every r  (0, r¯).

(C.8)

Proof. This is basically a direct consequence of Theorem C.3. The only thing left to check is the dependence
of the constants. But this is straightforward by observing that vi,x0  = ui  for every i = 1, . . . , , and that

DAx0 (x)  =

D

A(Tx0

x)A(x0

)

1 2

,

which

is

uniformly

bounded

for

x  ,

because

of

(H 2)

and

the

continuity

of

the

map

x0



A(x0

)

1 2

.

This

allows to take C and r¯ which are independent of x0.

Now that we have shown an Almgren's monotonicity formula with constants independent of x0 in any compactly contained subset of , we have all tools required to conclude the proof of the main result of this appendix.

C.3 Proof of the regularity result
End of the proof of Theorem C.1. (a) : To prove that the functions ui are Lipschitz continuous for any i = 1, ...,  we argue as in the proof of [47, Proposition 3.4], with minimal adaptations at this point:

44

· we have an elliptic divergence type operator instead of the pure Laplacian operator, therefore the estimates will depend on the ellipticity constant ;
· the identity (C.2) plays the role of the identity in the last assumption of [47, Proposition 3.4], while the monotonicity formula (Theorem C.9) plays the role of the monotonicity formula [47, Theorem 3.3].
For related proofs of Lipschitz continuity in similar contexts, see also [41, Section 4.1] or [54, Section 2.4], the latter being a more detailed version of the former.
(b) : Regarding the regularity properties of  := {x   : ui(x) = 0 i = 1, . . . , }, we argue as in the proof of [55, Theorem 1.1]:
· again, here we have an elliptic divergence type operator instead of the Laplacian;
· formula (C.4) plays the role of the expression for the derivative of E(x0, U, r) in the statement of [55, Theorem 1.1] (see condition (G3) therein), while our Theorem C.9 plays the role of the monotonicity formula [55, Theorem 2.2].
At a regular point x0  , identity (C.4) (or, equivalently, the local Pohozaev identities (C.2)) together with the equations

- div(A(x)ui) = fi(x, s) in the open set {x   : ui(x) > 0}, given by assumption (H6), provide the free boundary condition

i = 1, . . . , ,

lim A(x)ui, ui = lim A(x)uj , uj = 0,

xx+ 0

xx- 0

where x  x±0 are the limits taken from opposite sides of ; see [55, Section 2] for the details. For related proofs of regularity in similar contexts, see also [47, Theorem 1.7] or [54, Chapter 3].

Remark C.10. We remark that Theorem C.1 can be seen as a direct consequence of Theorem 7.1 in [55]. However, since the latter result is presented without proof, we have decided to write this appendix and give all the necessary details.
