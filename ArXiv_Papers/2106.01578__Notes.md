## Abstract

This short tutorial provides an introduction to the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Specifically, how to use QAOA with the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm to solve the Max-Cut problem. All steps of the algorithm are explicitly shown and no theory or complex mathematics are used. The focus is entirely on setting up a practical implementation. Fully functional examples in both R and python (using Qiskit) are provided, both using roughly 100 lines of code.
