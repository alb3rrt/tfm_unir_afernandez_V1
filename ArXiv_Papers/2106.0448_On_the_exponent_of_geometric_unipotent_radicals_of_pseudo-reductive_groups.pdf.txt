ON THE EXPONENT OF GEOMETRIC UNIPOTENT RADICALS OF PSEUDO-REDUCTIVE GROUPS
FALK BANNUSCHER, MAIKE GRUCHOT, AND DAVID I. STEWART
Abstract. Let k/k be a finite purely inseparable field extension and let G be a reductive k-group. We denote by G = Rk/k(G) the Weil restriction of G across k/k, a pseudo-reductive group. This article gives bounds for the exponent of the geometric unipotent radical Ru(Gk¯), focusing on the case G = GLn.
1. Introduction Let k be a field, which we assume is imperfect of characteristic p. In this case there exist pseudo-reductive k-groups which are not reductive. Recall that a smooth, connected, affine algebraic k-group G is pseudo-reductive if the largest smooth connected unipotent normal subgroup Ru,k(G) is trivial.
We are interested in the structure of the geometric unipotent radical R := Ru(Gk¯) = Ru,k¯(Gk¯) of G, which is typically not trivial. (Of course, G is reductive precisely when this subgroup is trivial.) Since R is a p-group, it makes sense to study its exponent : the minimal integer s such that the ps-power map on the geometric unipotent radical factors through the trivial group. We denote the exponent of R by e(R).
M. Bate, B. Martin, G. Ro¨hrle and the third author previously gave some bounds for e(R) in [1]. For example, [1, Lem. 4.1] implies that if k/k is a simple purely inseparable field extension with (k)pe  k, then e(R)  e.
The celebrated monographs [4] and [5] contain a classification of the pseudo-reductive groups. One consequence is that almost all are in some way or other related to the Weil restrictions of reductive groups, which are themselves pseudo-reductive, and we focus most of our efforts on those; thus we assume unless stated otherwise that G = Rk/k(G) for some reductive k-group G where k is a finite non-zero reduced k-algebra. Since we are interested in e(R), by the remarks in [1, §4] we may as well consider the case that k is separably closed and k is a purely inseparable field extension of k. In this case G is a split reductive group and as such is classified by its root datum.
Recall that the exponent of the extension k/k is the smallest integer e such that (k)pe  k. To describe our results, we need more sensitive data about the structure of k/k. Since k/k is purely inseparable, we can appeal to the results in [8] and [9], which guarantee a normal generating sequence 1, . . . , l of k over k with certain properties--see Definition 2.6 below for more details. In particular, these elements come with certain exponents which are invariants of k/k. These are the integers e1  . . .  el such that ei is minimal with
pi ei  k(p1ei , . . . , pi-ei1).

It is immediate that e1 = e and it follows from the Tower Law that [k : k] = pei . We define integers

l

l

m(k/k) := (pei - 1) + 1 = pei - l + 1,

i=1

i=1

em(k/k) := logp(m(k/k)),

r

mr(k/k, r) := pei , where ei = 0 for i > l,

i=1
emr(k/k, r) := logp(mr(k/k, r)) and finally E := min{em(k/k), emr(k/k, r)}.

In other words em(k/k) is the minimal s such that ps  m(k/k), and similarly for emr.

In answering a question of [1] on the exponent of the intersection of R with a suitable `Borel
subgroup', we discovered that these numbers give lower bounds on e(R) and for large enough rank determine the exponent of R exactly. We first state our results in case G = GLr.

Theorem 1.1. Let k/k be a finite, purely inseparable field extension of a separably closed
field k of characteristic p. Suppose k/k has exponent e and a normal generating sequence
1, . . . , l with sequence of exponents e1, . . . , el. Let G := GLr, G := Rk/k(GLr) and R := Ru(Gk¯). Furthermore let B denote a Borel subgroup of G and B := Rk/k(B)  G. The following hold:

(i) if s satisfies ps  per then e(R) is at most s; i.e. e(R)  e + logp(r);

(ii) we have e(R  Bk¯) = E;

(iii) in particular, e(R)  E;

(iv) if

l i=r+1

then

e(R)

em(k/k).

Remarks 1.2. (i). Part (i) of Theorem 1.1 improves [1, Lem. 4.4], which required ps  r2(pe - 1). As a corollary, if p  r is an odd prime then the exponent of Ru(Gk¯) is e if k/k is a simple extension and is e + 1 otherwise.
(ii). In [1, Rem. 4.5(iv)], it was asked if the exponent e(Ru(Gk¯)) always coincides with the exponent e(R  Bk¯). Clearly Theorem 1.1(ii)-(iv)--whose proof relies on constructing matrices of high nilpotency degree--answers this question when G = GLr of large enough rank. We give an example to show that in general the answer is `no' (see Proposition 4.3), coming from SL2 in characteristic 2. In fact, in Section 4 we give a complete description of e(R) when G is SL2, PGL2 or GL2.
(iii). We have stated our results for the case G = GLr, from which one derives an upper bound for a reductive subgroup H  G; see Proposition 2.3(iii). For G split simple, one could use the Steinberg generators {hr(t), x(u)} of a Borel subgroup together with the Chevalley commutator formula to deduce lower bounds of the form given in Theorem 1.1(ii), but this would not much further elucidate matters. Nevertheless, since G contains a subgroup isomorphic to SL2 or PGL2, one immediately deduces from the results in Section 4 that e(R)  e + 1 whenever p = 2 and k/k is non-simple.

2. Preliminaries and Notation
Let k be a field of characteristic p and G be a k-group, by which we mean an affine algebraic group scheme of finite type over k. The k-unipotent radical is the maximal smooth connected normal unipotent k-subgroup of G and we denote this by Ru,k(G). The geometric unipotent radical is the k¯-unipotent radical of Gk¯ = G k k¯. This is denoted by Ru(Gk¯). We call a

smooth connected k-group G reductive if Ru(Gk¯) = 1 and pseudo-reductive if Ru,k(G) = 1. From now on G will always be pseudo-reductive.
We recall the definition and some main properties from [2, Sec. 7.6] and [4, A.5].

Definition 2.1. Let B  B be a finite flat map of noetherian rings, and X a quasiprojective B-scheme. The Weil restriction is a finite type B-scheme satisfying the universal property
RB/B (X)(A) = X(B B A)
for all B-algebras A.

The following proposition makes use of the natural map

(2.2)

qG : Rk/k(G)k  G,

which is induced by k k A  A; a  b  ab for any k-algebra A.

Proposition 2.3 ([4, Prop. A.5.11, Thm. 1.6.2], [1, §2], [1, Lem. 3.4]). Let k/k be purely inseparable, G a non-trivial smooth connected k-group and G = Rk/k(G).
(i) The kernel of qG is a smooth connected unipotent k-subgroup and thus it is contained in Ru,k (Gk ).
(ii) If G is reductive over k, then the kernel of qG has field of definition over k equal to k  k¯. Thus the kernel ker(qG ) coincides with Ru,k (Gk ), which is a k-descent of Ru(Gk¯) (i.e. Ru,k (Gk )k¯ = Ru(Gk¯)).
(iii) If H is a reductive subgroup of G then the geometric unipotent radical of Rk/k(H) is a subgroup of the geometric unipotent radical of Rk/k(G).
(iv) If f : G1  G2 is a smooth isogeny of reductive k-groups then Rk/k(f )k¯ induces an isomorphism of geometric unipotent radicals of the respective Weil restrictions.

We are interested in the following invariant of a unipotent k-group:

Definition 2.4. Let k be a field of characteristic p and U a unipotent k-group. The exponent e(U ) of U is the minimal s such that the ps-power map on U factors through the trivial
group.

Clearly, this definition is insensitive to base change. We therefore assume k is separably closed for the remainder of the article.
When calculating with matrices, we make use of the fact that if U (k)  U is dense (e.g. if k is perfect [6, Thm. 34.4]), then a map factors through the trivial group if and only if it maps to the identity on U (k). Since R = Ru(Gk¯) descends to R := Ru,k(Gk ) whose k-points are dense (by the fact that k is separably closed) we have e(R) is the smallest s such that ps kills R(k).
Following [7], let B := k k k. Then B is a local ring with maximal ideal
m = x  1 - 1  x | x  k = ker(),
where  : k k k  k; a  b  ab. Moreover, Rk/k(G)k can be identified with RB/k (GB) and the k-points of the k-unipotent radical of the former is the kernel G(m) of the map G(B)  G(k) induced by . Suppose now G = GLr and G = Rk/k(G). As the entries of any M  Mat(r, m) are nilpotent elements of B, it follows that Ir + M has invertible determinant, hence is an element of G(m). Therefore
Ru,k(Rk/k(GLr)k )(k) = {Ir + M | M  Mat(r, m)}.
As Ir and M commute, we have Aps = Ir + M ps = Ir is equivalent to M ps = 0. Hence:

Lemma 2.5. The exponent of the geometric unipotent radical of Rk/k(GLr) is the smallest s such that M ps = 0 for all M  Mat(r, m).

It was observed in [1, Lem. 4.1] that as mn = 0 for some n  N, one knows that s in the lemma above is bounded above by the minimal t such that pt  n: the entries of M pt are homogeneous polynomials of degree pt in the entries. Further information about the structure of k/k allows one to be more specific about this minimal n.
For x  k, let e(x) denote the minimum power pt such that xpt  k. Observe that the nilpotency degree of the element  = x  1 - 1  x  m coincides with e(x).
Many of our results are framed in terms of normal generating sequences.

Definition 2.6. Let k/k/k be a tower of finite purely inseparable field extensions. (i) If x  k then the minimal s  N such xps  k is called the exponent of x with respect to k and denoted by ek (x).
(ii) We say that x  k is normal in k/k if ek (x)  ek (y) for all y  k.
(iii) A sequence 1, . . . , l in k is called a normal sequence if for every 1  i  l and ki = k[1, . . . , i] we have
· i is normal in k/ki-1;
· i / ki-1.
(iv) A normal sequence 1, . . . , l is called a normal generating sequence of k/k if k[1, . . . , l] = k.
(v) For a normal generating sequence 1, . . . , l of k/k we set ei = eki-1(i). We call e1, . . . , el a sequence of exponents for k/k

Note that if e1, . . . , el is a sequence of exponents for k/k then we have e1  e2  . . .  el due to [9, Prop. 5].

Crucially, by loc. cit. we also have

(2.7)

pi ei  k(p1ei , . . . , pi-ei1) for all 1  i  l.

In particular, as the ei are decreasing,

(2.8)

(k)pei  k(p1ei , . . . , pi-ei1).

Combining this with the main result of [8], we get that the sequence of exponents is an invariant of the field extension k/k. More precisely:

Lemma 2.9. Let k/k be a finite purely inseparable field extension. Suppose that 1, . . . , l and 1, . . . , l are normal generating sequences of k/k with sequences of exponents e1, . . . , el and e1, . . . , el . Then l = l and ei = ei for 1  i < l.
By the lemma, the numbers m(k/k), mr(k/k, r) defined in the introduction are both invariants of k/k and (k/k, r) respectively. The following result helps us to relate these numbers to m = x  1 - 1  x | x  k .

Lemma 2.10. For a normal generating sequence 1, . . . , l, define ai := i  1 - 1  i. Then:
(i) the ideal m is generated by the ai over k; (ii) the pei -power map takes m into the k-subspace k[ap1ei , . . . , api-ei1]  m.

Proof. (i) Since m is a codimension 1 (left) k-subspace of B, it is a codimension [k : k]

k-subspace of B. Define J = {(b1, b2, . . . , bl)  Zl | 0  bi  pei - 1}. For b = (b1, ..., bl) 

J we set xb =

l i=1

bi i

.

Then {xb}bJ is a k-basis of k and {1  xb} is a k-basis of

B. For b = (0, . . . , 0), the elements 1  xb - xb  1 = 1  xb - xb(1  1) are therefore

linearly independent, generating a codimension 1 subspace of B, which is contained in the

codimension 1 kernel m of the multiplication map x  y  xy, hence they form a k-basis of

m. We wish to show ab := xb  1 - 1  xb  m := m  k[a1, . . . , al] by induction on bi,

the case bi = 1 being trivial. So let bi > 1. Without loss of generality, suppose b1 > 0 and let b = b - (1, 0, . . . , 0). Then ab = xb  1 - 1  xb  m. Now one checks directly that ab = xb a1 + 1xb - ab · a1 and hence ab  m as required. (And it follows that m = m.)

(ii) Define m := k[ap1ei , . . . , api-ei1]  m. From (i), we can express any element of m as a

k-polynomial in a1, . . . , al. Since k has characteristic p, the pei -power map distributes over

addition and so it suffices to check that (ar11 · · · arl l )pei  m for some integers r1, . . . , rl. For

k-polynomial Q in 1, . . . , i-1. Expressing Q  1 - 1  Q as a k-polynomial in the aj with

1  j  i - 1 and then taking pei -th powers gets us home.

We may now identify the minimal integer n such that mn = 0 with the integer m(k/k). In fact we also prove something stronger:

Lemma 2.11. With notation as above, let d  l and suppose m1, . . . , md  m and f1, . . . , fd  Z0.
If fi  mr(k/k, d) - d + 1 = pei - d + 1 then mf11 · · · mfdd = 0. In particular, the minimum n such that mn = 0 is m(k/k).

Proof. Assume for a contradiction that m := mf11 · · · mfdd = 0. We proceed by induction on d, observing that the product of any factors of m is also non-zero. It does no harm to assume

that f1  . . .  fd. If d = 1, then mr(k/k, 1) = pe1 = pe and indeed m = 0, a contradiction.

Otherwise, let c be maximal such that fc  pec. We have

c i=1

so

if c < d, then mf11 · · · mfcc is zero by induction, a contradiction. Therefore c = d. Let (qi, ri)

be the quotient and remainder when ped is divided into fi. As fi  fd  ped we have each

qi  1. Now

f1 + . . . + fd = ped (q1 + . . . + qd) + (r1 + . . . + rd)  pe1 + . . . + ped - d + 1

and so

ped (q1 + . . . + qd)  ped (q1 + . . . + qd-1 + 1)  pe1 + . . . + ped - d + 1 - d(ped - 1)

= ped (pe1-ed + . . . + ped-1-ed - d + 1) + 1.

Since the second expression above is a multiple of ped , we have

q1 + . . . + qd  pe1-ed + . . . + ped-1-ed - (d - 2).

Now as fi write each

Continuing inductively, 1  pe1 - ped + 1. Thus 1  pe1 and hence all monomials in m are zero, a contradiction.

We now tackle the second statement. To see that n  m(k/k), observe that a :=

l i=1

is a product of m(k/k) - 1 elements from {a1, . . . , al}. Expanding this product in terms of

the k-basis {xb  xc | b, c  J } of B, the coefficient of xb  1 where b = (pe1 - 1, . . . , pel - 1)

is easily seen to be 1. It follows that a = 0.

For the upper bound, take d = l in the first part of the lemma, noting that m(k/k) = mr(k/k, l) - l + 1.

3. Bounds in the case of the general linear group
In this section, G = GLr and G = Rk/k(G), where k/k is purely inseparable of exponent e. In [1, Lem. 4.4] it was shown that the exponent e(R) of R := Ru(Gk¯) is at most s, where s is chosen such that ps  r2(pe - 1). Using the Cayley­Hamilton theorem in its full generality (see [3, III.8.11]) yields an improvement.

Proof of Theorem 1.1(i). Let M  Mat(r, m), as in Lemma 2.5. By the Cayley­Hamilton

theorem, we have M (M ) = 0, where M () = r +

r-1 t=0

ftt

is

the

characteristic

poly-

nomial of M with degree r. Observe that the coefficient ft is either zero or a homogeneous

polynomial in the entries of m with degree r - t. Since the matrices M r-1, . . . , M, Ir all

commute and k k k has characteristic p, we get

M rpe = -(frp-e 1M (r-1)pe + . . . + f1pe M pe + f0pe Ir) = 0,

since ftpe = 0 for all ft  m. Choosing s such that ps  per we get M ps = M perM ps-per = 0.

Let B  G be the upper Borel subgroup, whose points are upper triangular matrices, and B = Rk/k(B)  G its Weil restriction. We now specify certain elements M  Mat(r, m) with M  B(k) = B(B) to construct lower bounds on e(R) which depend on r and the
exponents ei of a normal generating sequence. Moreover, we calculate exactly the exponent of the intersection R  Bk¯.
Before we give the proof, we make some elementary remarks about powers of matrices. If A
is a commutative ring and Ei,j  Mat(r, A) is the r × r elementry matrix with ei,j = 1 and zeros everywhere else, then we have Ei,j El,s = Ei,s if and only if j = l and 0 else. Write M = aijEi,j for a general element of Mat(r, A) . Then after expansion, any non-zero term in the power M n is of the form aw · Ei1,in+1 where aw = ai1,i2 · ai2,i3 · · · ail,in+1 , and w  (i1, . . . , in+1)  {1, . . . , r}n+1. Furthermore, the (i, j)-th entry of M n is the sum over all aw such that i1 = i and in+1 = j. For w  {1, . . . , r}n+1, say n is the length of w. Now, if M is an upper triangular matrix, then aw will be zero unless ij  ij+1 for each 1  j  n + 1. Hence the only w yielding non-zero aw are non-decreasing sequences of integers from {1, . . . , r}, whose length is bounded above by m(k/k) (Lemma 2.11).

Proof of Theorem 1.1(ii)-(iv). We work inside B(m). There are two cases. Suppose we

have

l i=r+1

(pei

-

1)

<

r

-

1.

Then there is an integer q < r with q

maximal such that

(peq+1 - 1) + . . . + (pel - 1)  q - 1. Define the matrix M  B(m) as follows.

(i) Start with M = 0;

(ii) From the top left corner, fill the first q spaces on the diagonal with a1, . . . , aq respectively; (iii) Fill up the first q - 1 elements of the superdiagonal with pel - 1 entries of al, then pel-1 - 1 entries of al-1 and so on;

ON THE EXPONENT OF GEOMETRIC UNIPOTENT RADICALS

(iv) If one has now written down peq+1 - 1 entries aq, then stop. Otherwise put aq in the qth position of the superdiagonal. If, after this, there are only peq+1 - 1 -  entries aq with   1 on the superdiagonal, we set also the (q + 1)st diagonal element equal to aq.
We claim M m(k/k)-1 = 0. Take the sequence

w = (1, . . . , 1, 2, . . . , 2, . . . , q, . . . , q , q + 1, . . . , q + 1)

pe1 times pe2 times

peq times

 +1 times

and observe that aw = 0. A little thought shows that this is the unique sequence w of this length with aw = 0 starting at 1 and ending at q + 1. This proves the claim. Hence we conclude e(R  Bk¯)  em(k/k) = E. Since M m(k/k) = 0 by Lemmas 2.11 and 2.5, we have e(R  Bk¯)  em(k/k) and so this case is done.

Now suppose

l i=r+1

(pei

r

One constructs a

similar

M.

Start

as

before with

M = 0. One fills the diagonal with a1, . . . , ar and the superdiagonal with any r - 1 elements

from the list (ar+1, . . . , ar+1, . . . , al, . . . , al ). This gives a matrix M such that M m = 0

per+1 -1 times

pel -1 times

where m =

r i=1

(pei

- 1) + r - 1

=

mr(k/k, r) - 1.

Hence

e(R  Bk¯)



emr(k/k, r).

We need to demonstrate the upper bound for this case. Take a matrix M  B(m) and any sequence w of length mr(k/k) such that aw = 0 in a product of mr(k/k, r) copies of
M . Suppose the diagonal of M is the same as diag(m1, . . . , mr) for some m1, . . . , mr  m. Then aw = mf11 · · · mfrr · µ for non-negative integers f1, . . . , fr and µ a product of s entries from above the diagonal; we have s  r - 1. Since mr(k/k) = fi + s, we have fi  mr(k/k, r) - r + 1. We are now done by Lemma 2.11.

For part (iii) of the theorem, we note that any lower bound for e(R  Bk¯) is automatically one for e(R). For part (iv) we just observe that E = em(k/k) is also an upper bound for e(R) by Lemmas 2.11 and 2.5.

4. Extended example of SL2 and PGL2 In this section we give a complete description of e(R) in case G = SL2, PGL2 or GL2.
Proposition 4.1. Let k/k be purely inseparable of characteristic p and exponent e. Let G be Rk/k(GL2), Rk/k(PGL2) or Rk/k(SL2), the last of these only if p = 2. Then e(R) is e if k/k is simple and e + 1 otherwise.

Proof. If G is GL2, then Theorem 1.1(iv) gives the exponent e(R) = e for k/k simple of exponent e, and at least e + 1 when k/k is non-simple. However, by Theorem 1.1(i) we have e(R) at most e + 1. As the map GL2  PGL2 is smooth, and SL2  GL2, we immediately obtain e or e + 1 respectively as upper bounds for both the cases G = SL2 and G = PGL2. In fact, the matrices constructed in the proof of Theorem 1.1 and their relevant powers are clearly non-zero in their image in PGL2(B) and so the exponents of the radicals in case G = GL2 and G = PGL2 coincide. Now by Proposition 2.3(iv) these also coincide for SL2 outside of characteristic 2, since the isogeny f : SL2  PGL2 is smooth.
We see some different behaviour for SL2 in characteristic 2; in particular, the exponents of Ru(Gk¯)  Ru(Bk¯) and Ru(Gk¯) do not coincide.
We prove a general formula for 2s-th powers of matrices over rings of characteristic 2.

Proposition 4.3. Let G = SL2, p = 2 and suppose k/k has normal generating sequence 1, . . . , l with exponents e1  e2  . . .  el. Let B be an upper Borel subgroup of G and B = Rk/k(B).
(i) We have e(R  Bk¯) = e;
(ii) We have e(R) = e + 1 if e1 = e2 e otherwise.

d = a(1 + a)-1 and a + d = ad = a2(1 + a)-1. By Lemma 4.2, the 2s-th power of this matrix

is

a2s 0

b(a2(1 + a)-1)2s-1 d2s

.

Choosing for example a = a1, one sees the minimal s for which M 2s = 0 is at least e1 = e. By contrast, (a2)2e-1 has at least 2e factors of a, hence is zero. So e(R  Bk¯) = e, proving (i).

For (ii), a general element of G(m) is a matrix I + M where M =

a c

b d

, satisfying

a + d + ad + bc = 0, since det(I + M ) = 1. If l = 1, (i.e. k/k is simple of exponent e = e1), then it is clear that e(R) = e. Suppose e2  e1-1 = e-1. We may write d = (1+a)-1(a+bc), hence t = a + d = (1 + a)-1(a2 + bc). Therefore t2e-1 = (1 + a)-2e-1 (a2e + b2e-1 c2e-1 ) =

(1 + a)-2e-1 (b2e-1 c2e-1 ). Now by Lemma 2.10 we have m2e-1

 m for any m  m.

It follows that b c 2e-1 2e-1 = 0, t2e-1 = 0 and hence, using the lemma, M 2e = 0. Therefore

e(R) = e as required.

Now suppose e1 = e2. Since G  Rk/k(GL2) we have e(R)  e + 1. Set b = a1, c = a2, d = 0 and a = a1a2. Then

M 2e =

(a1a2)2e +

the
