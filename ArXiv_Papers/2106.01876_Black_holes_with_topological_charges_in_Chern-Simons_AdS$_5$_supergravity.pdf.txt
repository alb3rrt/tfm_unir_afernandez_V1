Abstract We study static black hole solutions with locally spherical horizons coupled to non-Abelian field in N = 4 Chern-Simons AdS5 supergravity. They are governed by three parameters associated to the mass, axial torsion and amplitude of the internal soliton, and two ones to the gravitational hair. They describe geometries that can be a global AdS space, naked singularity or a (non-)extremal black hole. We analyze physical properties of two inequivalent asymptotically AdS solutions when the spatial section at radial infinity is either a 3-sphere or a projective 3-space. An important feature of these 3-parametric solutions is that they possess a topological structure including two SU (2) solitons that wind nontrivially around the black hole horizon, as characterized by the Pontryagin index. In the extremal black hole limit, the solitons' strengths match and a soliton-antisoliton system unwinds. That limit admits both non-BPS and BPS configurations. For the latter, the pure gauge and non-pure gauge solutions preserve 1/2 and 1/16 of the original supersymmetries, respectively. In a general case, we compute conserved charges in Hamiltonian formalism, finding many similarities with standard supergravity black holes.

1 Introduction
Chern-Simons (CS) supergravity [1] provides an excellent theoretical laboratory to investigate many theoretical aspects of gravitational physics, including black holes. In particular, when formulated about five-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS5) space, the theory gives a tractable model to study the effects of introducing higher-curvature terms in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. On the one hand, in contrast to other theories involving higher-curvature terms, CS theory is of second order. On the other hand, lacking of local degrees of freedom when linearizing about AdS5, it happens to evades the standard causality bound arguments coming from AdS/CFT [2], cf. [3, 4, 5].
The theory is defined by considering the five-dimensional CS action for a supergroup that includes the four-dimensional conformal group SO(2, 4) as a part of its bosonic components. A simple example of such a supergroup is given by SU(2, 2|N ), cf. [6]. This construction yields a gauge field theory that, when expressed in the appropriate variables, takes the form of a higher-curvature theory of gravity coupled to additional fields. The latter fields represent the matter content of the theory, and they typically consist in fermions and gauge fields that are associated to the other fermionic and bosonic generators of the supergroup, respectively. In spite of containing quadratic-curvature terms in the gravitational part of the action, the field equations of the theory are of second order, which follows from the fact that CS gravity is a particular case of Lovelock theory. This makes the theory free of ghosts and tractable analytically. In fact, many sectors of the solution space of the CS (super-)gravity theory can be explicitly worked out. This includes black holes [7, 8, 9, 10], wormholes [11], geometries with anisotropic scale invariance [12, 13], pp-waves, and many other interesting geometries [14]. The existence of such a diversity in the configuration space is somehow associated to certain degree of degeneracy that the theory exhibits, which relates to its peculiar dynamical structure [15, 16].
AdS5 black hole solutions in CS supergravity have been explicitly constructed, for instance, in references [17, 18, 19, 20]. In particular, in [18], charged AdS5 black hole solutions were studied for the case of the supergroup SU(2, 2|N ), which is the minimal supergroup containing AdS5 × U(1) configurations. For this model, asymptotically locally AdS5 black hole solutions carrying U(1) charge were explicitly found. It was shown that non-vanishing torsion is necessary for the U(1) to be present, with the coupling of torsion being realized by an operator that resembles that of the universal axion of string theory. Here, we will generalize the construction of [18] by studying spherically symmetric black hole solutions coupled to non-Abelian field in N = 4 CS AdS5 supergravity. These solutions are characterized by five different parameters, including the axial torsion coupling. In particular, we will construct BPS black hole configurations, along with other solutions. We will compute the topological charges of the solutions as well as the conserved charges, yielding the black hole mass spectrum.
The field content of CS supergravity differs from that of standard supergravity. In the former, all the fields, including the ones associated with the gravity sectory, namely the vielbein ea, the spin connection ab, and the gravitino s, are gauge components of a Lie
3

algebra-valued gauge connection. However, for the sake of simplicity and interpretational purpose, hereafter the term `gauge field' will mainly be reserved for the part of the CS gauge connection associated with an internal symmetry fields: the SU(N ) non-Abelian field A and the U(1) gauge field A. The latter field, to which we will refer as U(1)q, becomes strongly coupled in the case with N = 4 supersymmetries, and thus we will mainly focus on solutions uncharged under it.
Despite the difference with standard supergravity, CS theory presents many similarities with it. For instance, as in standard supergravity, the Bogomol'nyi­Prasad­Sommerfield (BPS) bound appears as a no-force condition, a sort of balance between gravitational and gauge fields interactions. More precisely, the black holes we will construct here are dressed with a topological structure that can be thought of as the presence of two SU(2) solitons winding nontrivially around the event horizon. This is captured by the Pontryagin index. In the limit in which the black holes become extremal, limit that includes both non-BPS as well as BPS configurations preserving 1/2 and 1/16 supersymmetries, the soliton-antisoliton system unwinds. This can be regarded as the no-force phenomenon and it is expressed by the topological charges of the solution. As said, the BPS black holes are a particular case of extremal configurations, so presenting vanishing Hawking temperature.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we review CS AdS5 supergravity, we present our conventions and collect formulae that will be used in the rest of the paper. In Section 3, we present the general ansatz for the black hole solutions we want to construct. We discuss different fibrations and topologies for the horizon, as well as the variety of torsion field configurations supporting the solutions. In Section 4, we construct black holes with non-Abelian charges, generalizing previous works and, in particular, the solutions studied in [18]. In Section 5, we study BPS solutions. We explicitly solve the Killing spinor equations and show that black holes preserving supersymmetries can be constructed analytically. In Section 6, we discuss the global properties of the solutions and we compute the topological charges associated to them. We compute the black hole mass spectrum and we perform a comparative analysis with other black hole solutions found in the literature. Section 7 contains our conclusions, while a series of appendices contain formulae and details of the calculations.

The real number k gives the gravitational constant. More precisely, k-1/3 = P / controls the Planck length P relative to the AdS radius . Hereafter, we omit writing the wedge product  between the forms for short.
The supertrace is defined through the symmetric invariant tensor (antisymmetric for
fermionic indices) of rank three,

with the generators

GM = JAB, G, G1, Qs , Q¯ s .

(2.3)

Here, JAB, G, G1 are the 15 + N 2 generators of the bosonic part of the superalgebra, SU (2, 2) ×SU (N ) ×U (1)q, Qs , Q¯ s being instead the 8N odd generators. The index `q' in the Abelian group is to distinguish it from other Abelian subalgebras within SU(N ) that

will play a role in our discussion. AdS generators are the SO(2, 4)  SU(2, 2) generators

JAB = -JBA, with A = (a, 5) (a = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) and Ja5 = Pa. They can be represented

in terms of the gamma matrices with the matrix elements (a) , where ,  = 1, . . . , 4

are spinorial indices in the fundamental representation of SU(2, 2) as JAB =

When N = 1, the internal generators are absent. The dimension of the superalgebra

SU(2, 2|N ) is D = N 2 + 8N + 15, and from that N 2 + 15 generators are bosonic and

8N fermionic. The off-shell number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom coincides

only when N = 3 or N = 5. Representation of all generators is given in Appendix A and

the properties of the gamma matrices in Appendix B.

We already see here that the case N

is special; when N = 4, the U(1)q generator becomes a central charge of SU(2, 2|4). Our

conventions related to the supersymmetry generators are

Q = [Q] , Q¯ = Q0 = [Q¯ ] , {a, b} = 2ab .

(2.7)

The metric ab = diag(-, +, +, +, +) is mostly positive, and the SO(2, 4) embedding metric is AB = diag(-, +, +, +, +, -).

where the Cartan-Killing metric of the AdS group is [AB][CD] = AC BD - AD BC with AB = diag(ab, -1). The symmetric invariant tensors of SU(N ) that appear in the CS 5-form Lagrangian are 12 = Tr (12) and i123 = Tr (12 3). Levi-Civita tensor in six-dimensional embedding space is defined by abcde5 = abcde. In terms of the Lorentz indices, the bosonic components of the invariant tensor are

(2.13)

The dimensionless coupling constants {, , , , , } are not independent, SU(2, 2|N ) being a simple supergroup. Invariance of the tensor (D(A)gMNK = 0) establishes the local supersymmetry when [15]

(2.14)

The only independent coupling, that defines the level of the CS action, is the gravitational

constant k.

On the other hand, the Cartan-Killing metric gMN = GM GN of the supergroup is given by eq. (A.5) in Appendix A. When N = 4, the algebra su(2, 2|N ) is semi-simple

because the Cartan-Killing metric is non-singular. When N = 4, the U(1) generator

becomes the center (it commutes with other supergenerators, as given by (2.5)­(2.5)) and

the metric is such that g1M = 0. Thus, the supergroup becomes psu(2, 2|N ). Its bosonic

generators

satisfy

g1M N

gMN .

Using the invariant tensor (2.12), the Lagrangian (2.1) can be written in components

in a covariant way. Focusing on the bosonic sector (s = 0), we get

L = LG(e, ) + LSU(N )(A) + LU(1)(A, e, , A) ,

(2.15)

where, up to a boundary term, the gravitational Lagrangian has the form

Rewritten in the tensorial notation with LG = d5x-g LG, we recognize the gravitational

Lagrangian density as the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet AdS gravity [7]

(2.17)

with the fixed Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant GB = 2/4, known as the CS point.
The CS AdS supergravity can, therefore, be regarded as a supersymmetric extension of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet AdS gravity in the CS point.2 The cosmological constant  = -3/2 < 0 also has different form in terms of the AdS radius compared to General Relativity3. Note that the limit GB  2/4 is not continuous because the CS action has
different local symmetries and a number of bulk degrees of freedom than the EinsteinGauss-Bonnet AdS gravity with a generic coupling GB = 2/4.
The five-dimensional analog of the Newton constant GN = 3/8k is read from the term R/16GN. In terms of the Planck length introduced after eq. (2.1), we have GN  3P . The normalization of the Lagrangian is such that the dimensionless CS level k is proportional to the ratio 3/GN.
The gauge field Lagrangians, on the other hand, are given by

(2.18)

where the interaction is included in the U(1)q part and A = A. The CS coupling for the U(1) field AF 2 is  given by (2.14), which vanishes for N = 4
and becomes negative for N > 4. If, in spite of this, we consider the large N limit, we find that the non-Abelian coupling F FA vanishes as   1/N , while the one of U(1) goes as   -1/N 2 and it also vanishes. Therefore, in the large N limit of the CS
AdS5 supergravity, the bosonic part of the action contains the gravitational and SU(N ) kinetic terms and the gravitational coupling with U(1)q field. Gravitational dynamics of this theory has been discussed in [18]. In addition, the whole supersymmetric part of
the action remains finite in this limit, both the kinetic term of the fermions and their
interaction with the gauge fields.
On the other hand, in the case N  4, as mentioned before, the coefficient , which
appears in the first term of the Lagrangian LU(1)q in (2.18), vanishes. This can, thus, be regarded as a point where the U(1)q field becomes strongly coupled. This will be relevant for our discussion of BPS configurations.

The first set of the above equations are the Einstein field equations augmented with higher-curvature modifications and a coupling to torsion tensor. F ab in those equations correspond to the so-called AdS-curvature 2-form (see (2.10)), which vanishes for solutions
that have constant curvature locally.

3 Static spherically symmetric black hole ansatz

We are interested in static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions of the supergravity theory described above. Consider the local coordinates xµ = (t, r, ym) on the spacetime manifold M  R × , such that  corresponds to the four-dimensional spatial manifold t = const with coordinates (r, ym), and  defines the three-dimensional transversal section t, r = const with local coordinates ym. The corresponding coordinates on the tangent
bundle will be labeled by a = (0, 1, i), where i = 2, 3, 4.
The most general static, spherically symmetric ansatz is given by the metric

ds2

=

-N 2(r)f 2(r)

dt2

+

dr2 f 2(r)

+

r2d2

,

(3.1)

where f (r) is the metric function whose positive roots define the horizons location, and N(r) is the lapse function. We choose the transversal line element rd such that  describes a three-dimensional space of constant curvature locally,

d2 = mn(y) dymdyn = ij e~ie~j ,

mn = ij e~ime~jn .

(3.2)

The difference between the submanifold , with the induced metric r2mn(y), and the submanifold  endowed with the (intrinsic) metric mn(y), is the radial fibration. When  is maximally symmetric, its intrisic radius can be rescaled to 1, -1 or 0. Here, we
allow non maximally symmetric constant curvature configurations with more than one
scale factor, and not all the radii can be rescaled to the unit size at the same time. This
is why we keep the size of  arbitrary in general. Possible geometries of the  section discussed here have topologies with  = M1 × M1 × M1, M1 × M2 or M3, where each of maximally symmetric spaces Mn  {Rn, Sn, Hn} can be locally flat, spherical or

9

hyperbolic, i.e., have zero, positive or negative intrinsic curvature constructed from the

metric of the submanifold Mn. For example, we can consider  to be a compact space

H3/, with  being a discrete subgroup of the isometries of the 3-hyperbolic space. On

, the curvature R~ij

is

to

the

metric

mn.

Note that in

general the transverse space is not maximally symmetric. For example, S1 × S2 geometry

breaks the maximal isometry group SO(4) of  to SO(2) × SO(3).

The five independent spherically symmetric components of the torsion tensor are

Tttr(r) = 0 , Trtr(r) = 0 , Tntm = ~(r)nm = 0 , Tnrm = (r)nm, Tnmk = (r) ~nmk . (3.3)
We restrict the torsion tensor only to the cases where the first three components vanish because other solutions involving these components have been discussed in [18]. In addition, when  = 0 and some of other torsional components are turned on, the Schwarzschild-like black hole solution was found in [23]. In our case, we will keep  non-vanishing, as it will turn out that this is an important field for construction of BPS states for the black holes. Therefore, for the solutions considered here at most the trace  and the axial torsion  could contribute to the dynamics of the system.
On the transversal section , nmk is a constant Levi-Civita tensor and ~nmk is a -covariant Levi-Civita tensor,

~nmk =  nmk ,

nmk  nmktr .

(3.4)

This summarizes our 6D, 5D and 3D Levi-Civita conventions (all with mostly plus signature conventions) as

abcde5 = abcde , abcde5 = -abcde ,

01ijk5 = 01ijk = ijk , 01ijk5 = -01ijk = ijk ,

012345 = 012345 = +1 .

(3.5)

As regarding U(1)q × SU(N ) fields, their form is determined by equations of motion. Namely, the BPS states are solitonic solutions, which are extended objects, and therefore they do not necessarily possess spherical symmetry. However, for simplicity, we will consider only U(1)q field components

At(r) , Ar(r) = 0 ,

(3.6)

which are the ones that are compatible with the metric isometries. The radial component is set to zero because it can always be written as total differential by redefinition of the radial coordinate. The above ansatz is suitable when the spacetime topology does not contain a S1 factor which could, in principle, allow for a non-trivial winding of the U(1)q field around the circle.
Let us single out three types of transversal sections (3.2):

10

(i ) Planar geometry allows the topologies S1 × S1 × S1, R2 × S1 and R3, and is given

by the flat metric

nm = mn ,

R~ij = 0 ,

 = 0.

(3.7)

(ii ) The 3-sphere S3 of radius a has constant positive curvature

R~ij =  e~i  e~j ,



=

1 a2

>

0,

(3.8)

and nm depends on three angular variables. Changing the topology to the hyperbolic one can be done by setting  < 0. The planar case ( = 0) has been included in the
previous point (3.7). (iii ) Non maximally symmetric transversal section is M1 × M2. For example, if the
boundary topology is S1 × S2, the maximal number (six) of isometries is broken to four isometries. The coordinates can be chosen as ym = (z, , ) and (3.2) is given by

d2 = a1 dz2 + a2 d2 + sin2  d2 .

(3.9)

Here, the z  z + 2 direction is compactified on the circle S1 of radius a1, and a2 is the radius of the sphere S2, the curvature has only one non-vanishing component R~ = 1/a22.
It is worth mentioning that the classification above refers to local properties of the

3-spaces, and that locally equivalent spaces that are constructed from the ones above

through identifications are also included.

Under these assumptions, and considering here only the cases (i )­(ii ) (the case (iii )

will be discussed elsewhere), we can write out the following vielbein and spin connection

The last two equations in (2.20) give restrictions to the Abelian A and internal A fields. In particular, while the U(1)q-gauge field in the static ansatz has vanishing Pontryagin density, F F = 0, it is possible to have nontrivial contributions to E from the non-Abelian internal symmetry sector and from gravity. Substituting our ansatz (3.10) for the metric and spin connection, we get for that equation of motion

(3.17)

The equations (3.15)­(3.17) are valid for any N . As already noticed, the case N = 4 has vanishing coupling  = 0, but the chosen ansatz is such that F F = 0, thus the only term involving this coupling, F F , vanishes for any N .
As usual in higher-curvature gravity, the solution space of the equations (3.15)­(3.17) contains several independent branches with well-defined geometries (in the sense that

12

the metric does not contain arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate). Our goal is to find one involving the internal non-Abelian fields that, at the same time, admits unbroken supersymmetries. To this end, let us review the known solutions and discuss the existence of the BPS states within them:

Global AdS space. Maximally symmetric, global AdS spacetime, with F AB = 0, is a particular solution of CS supergravity. It amounts to setting

f2

=



+

r2 2

,

(3.18)

in the metric (3.1). It can exist with or without the addition of the U(1) × SU(N ) matter fields.
Without matter, the Killing spinors in the global AdS space have been constructed in [19] based on the Killing spinor equation within a class of supergravities. They are completely determined by the Killing spinors of the transverse section , and for maximally symmetric  they admit the maximum number of supersymmetries. Killing spinors have been classified for complete, connected, irreducible Riemannian manifolds of Euclidean signature in [24, 25, 26]. In particular, the spinors on   Sn have been constructed in [27].

Global AdS space with the U(1)q × SU(4) fields. In [16], the Killing spinors and

the

state

were

constructed

in

the

case

of

N

=

4,

when

the

spacetime

is

globally

AdS5, such that

F AB = 0 , F = 0 , F  = 0 .

(3.19)

The space has the planar S1 × S1 × S1 topology (3.7) with  = 0, such that the isometry

group is broken as SO(4)  U(1) × U(1) × U(1), and the SU(4) group is also broken to

U(1) × U(1) × U(1). Because of 1(U(1)) = Z, the non-trivial central charge and the BPS state are characterized by three integers, one for each coordinate ym  ym + 2.

Explicitly, the isomorphism SU(4)  SO(6) enables to represent the internal symme-

try generators G = {TIJ} with the 4 × 4 blocks  = {IJ } in terms of an independent

set

of

the

gamma

matrices

I J

=

1 2

~ I J

(I, J

=

1, ..., 6).

The cancellation of different

components of F IJ is achieved along the Cartan subalgebra T12 × T34 × T56, with two

non-vanishing Abelian components of the field strength (subgroup of SU(4)), and also

non-vanishing U(1)q field. The Abelian fields appearing in this solution are not spherically symmetric (for exam-

ple, Frm, Fmn = 0) and they describe a soliton. We expect similar feature to hold for the

Abelian and internal non-Abelian fields in the case of black holes.

Dimensionally continued black hole. Dimensionally continued black holes are exact solutions of CS AdS gravity in odd dimensions D  5 when the torsion vanishes [8]; the BTZ black hole can be regarded as the case D = 3. They are characterized by

13

the mass M and, when coupled to the Maxwell field, by the electric charge Q. In pure

CS gravity, Q = 0, and

f 2(r)

=

M

,

Ta = 0.

(3.20)

The spacetime topology is the one of the unit sphere,   SD-2. The AdS space corre-

sponds to a state of mass M = -1. The black holes solutions are separated by a gap of

naked singularities -1/a = -1 < M < 0 from the black hole solutions with M  0. This

behavior of the solutions is similar to the one in D = 3 dimensions (i.e. BTZ black holes),

therefore the name `dimensionally continued black holes'.

In sum, the solutions behave in the following way:

M >0
M =0 -Ma12=<-Ma12 < 0

Black holes Black hole ground state Naked singularities Global AdS space

In the list above, we introduced the radius a of the sphere SD-2 (compared to [8]); recall, one can rescale a = 1. The scalar curvature behaves near r = 0 as

(3.21)

We see that the singularity at r = 0 is absent only in the global AdS space. The black hole ground state with M = 0 is the smallest black hole and it has the horizon with zero radius.
Black hole solutions with zero horizon area (and then vanishing black hole entropy at the supergravity level), are familiar in string theory, where they are called "small black holes". They are typically associated to string states and require, for finding the entropy, a quantum attractor mechanism taking into account the presence of higher curvature terms [28, 29, 30].
The BPS states exist only for the global AdS space (M = -1), as discussed in the previous paragraph. In particular, the zero mass black hole is not supersymmetric [19].

U(1)q-neutral black hole with axial torsion. In absence of torsion, CS AdS gravity is in fact a special case of Lovelock AdS gravity, whose exact spherically symmetric,

static solutions are dimensionally continued black holes. They do not admit BPS states

if M = -1. Addition of the axial torsion ( = 0,  = 0) has been discussed in [17]. The

solution is

U(1)q-charged black hole. Black hole solutions in the AdS5 × U(1)q sector with A = 0 were discussed in [18] for arbitrary coupling constants (not necessarily supersym-
metric). This branch of solutions is completely independent on the previous one, in the
sense that the latter is not a special case of the former, although both branches do share common particular sub-cases. In case of the planar geometry (3.7) (where ~ab = 0) and
the torsion tensor with  = 0, the general solution reads

Note that the AdS curvature is divergent, Fr1mi  , on two surfaces: on the horizon r = r+ (when f = 0) and at r = C (when h = 0). It turns out that these points intro-

duce singularities in the torsional curvature invariants, but not in the Riemann curvature

invariants.

This solution does not admit Killing spinors in general.

4 Black hole solutions with the non-Abelian field

In this section we will add an SU(N ) field to the solution. We consider the case where the transversal space is isomorphic to the 3-sphere. Then equations (3.15)­(3.17) have at least two branches of solutions, distinguished by the vanishing or not of the function

(r)

=



+

r2 2

-

2

-

2

,

(4.1)

introduced in eq. (3.14) (see, for instance, E1). Recall that, geometrically, in case of a constant axial torsion  = C,  becomes the AdS field strength on the 3-sphere, as we can see from the last of eqs. (3.13).
We will analyze separately the two cases  = 0 and  = 0.

15

4.1 Branch with  = 0
We assume that  = 0 because it defines the axial torsion. Then the condition  = 0 determines the function  in terms of  up to a global sign  = ±1 by means of (3.14). One can show that taking  = 0 is in contradiction with E01, and  = 0 leads to  = 0 in order to satisfy E0, so that the solution is

 = h = 

r2 2

+



-

C2

,

=C,

(4.2)

where C is an integration constant. The remaining independent equations not involving the internal non-Abelian field, Eij and Ei, become

- 2CAt = (f + )(N f + ) ,

f (N f )

=

r 2

+

b 2

.

(4.3)

We can distinguish three cases to determine the unknown functions At, N and f .

1) When At = 0, the solution is

At

=

-

f + 2C f

f

+ 



r 2

+

b 2

,

f (N f )

=

r 2

+

b 2

.

(4.4)

These two equations are not enough to solve three radial functions. In absence of internal non-Abelian fields, N(r) remains arbitrary. In that case, a radial evolution of the spacetime geometry is not determined by initial conditions. Such "free geometry" has been observed in Lovelock gravity [31], higher-order curvature theory that can have multiply degenerate vacua and accidental symmetries that turn fields into non dynamical ones. Similar feature has been noticed in CS AdS5 supergravity with maximal number of spherically symmetric torsional components [18]. In this work, we will not consider these degenerate geometries.
When internal non-Abelian fields are added, there is an additional interaction with the metric which could help to determine N. The only equation with such interaction is (see last line in (3.17))

At Fnl =  12 2Ftn1 Frl2 - Ftr1 Fnl2 ~mnl .

(4.5)

Therefore, to avoid a free geometry, the above equation together with (4.4) has to fully
determine At, f and N . We expect that a U(1)q-charged black hole with internal nonAbelian fields would exist only when N = 4.
When N = 4, the U(1)q field becomes non dynamical (a central extension in the algebra) and the black hole is U(1)q-neutral.

16

At = 0 ,

(4.7)

where b0 is another integration constant, conveniently normalized. Thus we have free parameters {C, b0, b}. The black hole horizon is determined by f (rh) = 0, N (rh) = 0.
The gravitational hair modifies the metric through N = 1, since it behaves asymptot-

ically as

3) Another nonequivalent -neutral solution with At = 0 is obtained when we take f +  = 0 in (4.3), which yields

At = 0 ,

f = - = -h ,

N = 1 - b0 + b ln  + r .

2 2



(4.10)

The expressions in this case involve the log terms in the metric functions N and f N when b = 0, and the geometry does not describe any longer usual AAdS space. It has faster fall-off when  = -1 than when  = 1. In particular, when b = 0, the space is AAdS, but still it possesses the gravitational hair b0 = 0 that modifies its asymptotics. When b = b0 = 0, we recover the solution with N = 1.

In the last two cases, 2) and 3), the internal non-Abelian field that satisfies equations (3.16) and (3.17) allows the static configuration

A = A(r, y) ,

(4.11)

with the internal non-Abelian field strength without support on the transversal section,

F  = Ftr dt  dr + Frm dr  dym .

(4.12)

17

An interesting case of the -neutral solution corresponds to b = b0 = 0, in which case

the branches 2) and 3) coincide. Then, without the internal non-Abelian field, it becomes

a

state

when

[17].

We will show in Section 5.3 that there is also a BPS

state that includes a pure gauge internal non-Abelian field.

4.2 Branch with  = 0

To solve the equations of motion, we express N from E1 and require that the spacetime

has non-vanishing axial torsion. Then E1i implies At = 0 and Eij enables to find f . The

solution is

f = -

where for b0 = 0 we recover eq. (4.25). Non-vanishing hair parameter b0 = 0 favors naked singularities (M < 0), global AdS space (M = -1) and the ground state black hole (M = 0).
However, we have to set b0 = 0 in order to have finite N on the horizon. Regarding the internal non-Abelian field contribution to the field equations (2.20), the equation E implies that the non-Abelian Pontryagin term has to satisfy

(4.19)

In the general case with b = 0,  = const., the above equation requires both Frm and Fmn to be different from zero.
On the other hand, the solution with no gravitational hair (that is, with both b = 0
and b0 = 0, in which case  = const. and N = 1) allows for a simpler but still non trivial solution, where the internal non-Abelian field strength takes value only on the transverse
space . In this special case, f +  = 0 and  becomes a constant `charge', with the

M = µ-  0,

An additional feature of this particular solution is that it allows the torsion component

C to decouple completely from the functions (r) and f (r), leading to a U(1)q-neutral and -charged black hole. Note that, unlike (3.23), now the metric function f = h does

not depend on the constant C. Furthermore, in this case the r.h.s. of (4.19) is zero so

we can choose Frm = 0 to solve it. Then it is straightforward to prove that the internal non-Abelian field equations (3.16) and (3.17) are solved. In consequence, F has support

only on , namely

4.3 The space of parameters of the black hole

All three solutions mentioned above, (4.7) and (4.10) (with  = 0), and (4.15) (with  = 0), have the space of the parameters characterized by, at most, four free parameters b0, b, µ and C. The metric function is such that the horizons are defined by

f (r±) = 0

M

,

(4.22)

where the mass parameter M and the value of L depend on the solution (M = C2 - , L = 0 when  = 0, and M = µ - , L = b when  = 0). The geometry has at most two

19

horizons r- and r+  r- of the form

r± = -L2 ± 2p . L  0 .

(4.23)

The event horizon rh = r+ exists when the extremality parameter p is real:

p2 =

r+ - r- 4

2

0.

(4.24)

The black hole becomes extremal in the limit when the two horizons coincide, p = 0.

Thus, the extremality parameter is a measure of the deviation of the black hole solution

from its ground state (the extremal case).

Indeed, similarly to (3.21), in D = 5 the Riemannian scalar curvature of the solution

near r = 0 behaves as

(4.26)

and it becomes zero in the extremal case p = 0. The cases where p2 < 0, p2 = -1 correspond to naked singularities, where an event
horizon hiding the singularity at r = 0 cannot be defined. In the next section we will focus on the solution (4.20), with N = 4 supercharges.

5 BPS states with the internal non-Abelian field
In this section we are interested in solutions with a standard asymptotically AdS spacetime (without gravitational hair (b = b0 = 0)) in the pseudo-Riemannian sector, and with a gauge field in the internal symmetry sector. In that way, the torsional degrees of freedom can modify the asymptotic behavior of the supercurvature, but its pseudo-Riemannian part has the usual asymptotically AdS form.
We will focus in particular on the case N = 4, that is with gauge supergroup SU(2, 2|4). Then the U(1)q generator becomes a central extension, making the corresponding field Aµ non dynamical4. Moreover, as we will explicitly discuss after eq. (5.3), in this case the odd generators of the superalgebra become U(1)q-neutral, so that the U(1)q charge should not play a role while looking to BPS solutions preserving a fraction of the N = 4 supersymmetries. However, the U(1)q field could have a non-trivial effect on topology [16], but typically not in the spherically symmetric ansatz. It was shown in the
4As mentioned before, when N = 4 the coefficient  vanishes and the U (1)q field becomes strongly coupled.
20

previous section that for spherically symmetric solutions, the time component At of the U(1)q gauge field is either vanishing, At = 0, or it is divergent on the boundary, similarly as in (3.23) (when  = 0), or the solution with At = 0 has free geometry if internal non-Abelian field is not suitably chosen (when  = 0). It is worthwhile emphasizing that
divergent fields on the asymptotically AdS boundary are not a problem as long as energy
and other conserved charges are finite. For simplicity, we set At = 0. We seek for bosonic solutions of the field equations (s, ¯s = 0) that are left invariant
under (globally defined) local supersymmetry transformations s, ¯s = 0. In general, gauge transformations with the local parameter

Recall that we also have the extremality parameter,

p2 = µ -   0 ,

(5.9)

where the negative values of p2 do not correspond to black holes, and it is convenient to introduce the third (dependent) parameter

~ =  - p2 =  - C2   .

Using the index decomposition a = (0, 1, i) in (5.7) and plugging the above fields in the components of the AdS curvature (3.12) and (3.13), we find the general form of the AdS curvature on-shell,

The consistency (5.6) of the Killing spinor equation with the AdS curvature (5.14) reads

(5.15)

The equations in (5.15) can be satisfied in the extremal limit, in which the conditions (5.12) hold, by taking the Killing spinors to be the eigenvectors of the 1 matrix:

1 =  ,  = ±1 .

(5.16)

Static Killing spinor equation. Let us write out in components the Killing spinor

Recall that ~ij is the intrinsic (torsioneless) spin connection of S3 satisfying T~i = de~i +

~ij  e~j = 0, so that it is a known function of e~k. In contrast, the spacetime torsion T a and the supertorsion F a5, defined in (2.10), are non-vanishing.

A solution of (5.21) depends on the explicit form of the black hole, the eigenvalue 

and the particular subgroup of SU(4) considered for the internal non-Abelian field.

As respect to the spinors that are the positive eigenstates of the 1-matrix, for them the first equation in (5.17) acquires an extra term due to  = +1, that yields a contribution

for

shows

that

it produces a constant flux of the non-Abelian field with Ftr = 0, that is inconsistent

with our requirement of static solutions, and in particular with the second line of (5.17).

Thus, we will disregard this solution for the given ansatz of the non-Abelian field, and

focus only on the  = -1 case.

5.1 Broken symmetry of the non-Abelian field
The fact that the BPS state has to satisfy eq. (5.6) suggests that the compact subgroup5 SO(4)  SO(2, 4) of the spacetime isometry group has to be `tuned' with the internal symmetry group SU(4). This in particular implies that, on the BPS solution, the internal symmetry SU(4)  SO(6) (we do not consider U(1)q any longer), will be broken at least to its subgroup SO(4)  SO(6). Setting to zero all components of F = FG that correspond to the broken symmetries also simplifies solving the field equations of CS AdS5 gravity that are quadratic in the field strengths.
The result depends on both the subgroup of SU(4) and on the topology of the spatial boundary , whose metric is mn given by (3.2). The existence of a topological charge, associated to a non trivial embedding, with winding number n  Z, of the internal symmetry group G in the asymptotic transverse space with topology Sk, depends on the k-th homotopy group k(G). In our case, since the transverse space  is three dimensional, k = 1, 2, 3. Using the table from [32], we identify the existence of possible winding numbers for the following relevant cases:

S1  U (1) :

S2



SO(3) SO(2)

:

S3



SO(4) SO(3)



S U (2)

:

1(S1) = Z , 2(S1) = 0 , 3(S1) = 0 , 1(S2) = 0 , 2(S2) = Z , 3(S2) = Z , 1(S3) = 0 , 2(S3) = 0 , 3(S3) = Z ,

and, correspondingly, for the isometry groups:

1(U (1)) = Z , 3(SU (2)) = Z , 3(SO(4)) = Z + Z .

The table presented above has much richer content when we also include quotient spaces of the type Sk/, with  a discrete subroup of Isom(Sk), such as "lens spaces" Sk/Zs [33]. In particular, for the 3-sphere with isometries  = Z2, the identification of its antipodal points leads to the topological space RP3  S3/Z2 that is the real projective 3-space, whose nontrivial homotopy groups are

1(RP3) = Z2 , 2(RP3) = 0 , 3(RP3) = Z ,
the group 1 being different compared to the one of S3. In the case discussed in this paper,  is the maximally symmetric 3-sphere S3 or its
identifications, and the corresponding (locally) isometry group is SO(4), while the internal symmetry is SU(4), which is locally equivalent to SO(6).
Non-trivial configurations then require in particular the internal symmetry group SU(4) to be broken to SO(4) or subgroups thereof. There are two nonequivalent maximal subgroups of SU(4) containing SO(4)  SU(2)+ × SU(2)- as a semi-simple factor (see for example [34]). One corresponds to SU(4)  SO(4)  SU(2)+ × SU(2)- irreducibly.
5Looking at SO(2) × SO(4)  SO(2, 4) would involve closed timelike curves.

24

In terms of SO(6), it corresponds to the decomposition SO(6)  SO(3) × SO(3). The other decomposition is SU(4)  SU(2)+ × SU(2)- × U(1)c that in terms of SO(6) reads SO(6)  SO(4) × SO(2)c. The two decompositions are distinguished by the corresponding nonequivalent branchings of the irreducible representations of SU(4). In particular,
for the former one, the fundamental representation 4 of SU(4) (the one pertaining to the odd generators) decomposes into the (2, 2) of SU(2)+ × SU(2)-, while for the latter it goes into the (2, 1)+1 + (1, 2)-1 of SU (2)+ × SU (2)- × U (1)c, so that the odd generators are U(1)c-charged. More information about these two decompositions can be found in Appendix D.
As we are going to discuss in the following text, our solution corresponds to choosing
the second of the branchings above, where the Killing spinor decomposes into a U(1)ccharged Dirac spinor on .

To implement explicitly the breaking of internal symmetry on the solution, it is convenient to represent the SU(4) generators in terms of SO(6) antisymmetric matrices TIJ = -TJI, where the indices labeling the generators run as I, J = 0, . . . , 5 for convenience (the Lie group is compact), and expand the SU(4) gauge field as

A

=

AG

=

1 2

AIJ TIJ

.

(5.22)

We will set to zero the components of AIJ corresponding to the broken generators. It
depends on  and  which ones are broken but, in all cases, they have to describe a soliton on the geometry whose transversal section is S3. Because we know that, due
to 3(SU(2)) = Z, the SU(2) group can have a non-trivial topological structure with winding around the 3-sphere, let us assume from the very beginning that the SU(4) is
broken to a subgroup containing at least an SU(2) factor, to be identified on the solution
with the diagonal SU (2)D  SU(2, 2) tangent space symmetry on S3 (a hat over SU(2) is to distinguish it from SU(2) factors in the internal symmetry group). Generators of the diagonal subgroup SU(2)D  SU(4) are neither of the generators of SU(2)±, but their linear combination.6 Let us consider the following decomposition, which corresponds to
the second of the branchings mentioned above. Using I = (0, 1, ^i, 5), we write

SO(6)  SU (4)  SU (2)+ × SU (2)- × U (1)c  SU (2)D × U (1)c ,

TIJ



{T+^i , T-^i , Tc}

 {T^i , Tc} ,

The U(1)c subgroup is generated by any commuting generator, for instance T15. Furthermore, T^i given by (5.23) are the generators of the diagonal subgroup SU(2)D  SU(2)+ × SU(2)-, written in the "dual" form

T^i

=

1 2

^i ^k^ T^k^

.

(5.23)

6Sometimes the term `diagonal subgroup' is used for an Abelian subgroup of diagonal matrices, but this is not the case here.

25

On the other hand, with the above choice the `left' and `right' SU(2)± generators are

T±^i

=

1 2

(±T0^i

-

T^i)

,

(^i = 2, 3, 4),

(5.24)

and they close two independent su(2) algebras,

[T±^i, T±^] = ^i^k^ T±k^ ,

[T+^i, T-^] = 0 .

(5.25)

Therefore, the gauge field in the maximal subgroup of the SU(4) gauge group, consistent with the isometries of the 3-sphere is

A = A^i+T+^i + A^i-T-^i + A15Tc .

(5.26)

Note that

A0^i = 1 2

A^i+ - A^i-

,

A^i^

=

-

1 2

^i^k^

Ak+^ + Ak-^

,

(5.27)

and the diagonal condition A^i+ = A^i-  -A^i identifies the subgroup with the nonvanishing SU (2) field A^i,

SU (2)D :

A0^i = 0 , A^i^  ^i^k^Ak^ ,

(5.28)

corresponding to the components along the generators T^i that close the su(2) algebra,

[T^i, T^] = -^i^k^ Tk^ .

(5.29)

In this text we will focus on the SU(2)D × U(1)c-valued solution of the form

A = A^iT^i + A15Tc .

(5.30)

With this choice at hand, we can focus on solving the Killing spinor equation construction of the particular BPS states.
In view of the above discussion and the definition (5.23), from now on it will be more
convenient to work with the `dual' AdS generators of SU(2)D and an associated `dual' spin connection on three-dimensional manifold ,

5.2 -charged BPS black hole
When  = µ - C2 = 0, the solution without gravitational hair is given by eqs. (4.20). Since the internal non-Abelian field has non-vanishing components Fmn, this combined with the integrability condition (5.17) and the rescaling (5.32) leads to the U(1)q-neutral solution of the form

where A is yet to be determined. This solution allows for a non trivial embedding of an SU(2) subgroup of the SU(4) internal symmetry group on the three-dimensional section
, since it identifies the action on the Killing spinor of the SU (2)D generator Ji on the tangent space of  with the one on the non vanishing generators of SU(4). This suggests to choose F as a field strength for a diagonal subgroup SU(2)D.

 is the covariant derivative on the 3-sphere acting on

the time-independent Killing spinor , and the internal non-Abelian field is Aµ = Aµ G.

The first equation has as a particular solution

and the second one can be solved by

At = 0 ,

(5.35)

Ar = 0 ,

(r, y) =

r 

(y)

,

(5.36)

where (y) is an arbitrary spinor on the 3-sphere such that 1 = -.

To solve the third equation for the Killing spinor in (5.34), we finally impose the

SU(2)D symmetry on the transversal part of the internal gauge field, with the generators G = {T^i, Tc}, as given by eq. (5.30). Replacing the known quantities, the last equation becomes

m + ~mi - C e~im Ji = (A^iT^i + A15Tc)  .

(5.37)

27

It can be solved by identifying, on the solution, the tangent space SU (2)D symmetry on 

(and the corresponding indices i, j, ...) with the internal SU(2)D symmetry (labeled with

indices ^i, ^, ...),

A^im = ~mi - C e~im ,

(Ji) s = (T^i)us u .

(5.38)

This solidary identification between the internal and spacetime symmetries is remi-
niscent of the t'Hooft-Polyakov monopole [35, 36], where the adjoint indices of the Higgs field are identified with those of the 3-space. Note that A^im transforms as an SU(2)D gauge connection. Due to the identification of the generators (5.38) when acting on the
spinor, we also identify the corresponding indices,

i  ^i  {2, 3, 4} ,

(5.39)

and stop writing the hats above the SU(4) counterpart from now on, unless we want to emphasize the difference. The signature on the identified sections is (+, +, +) in both groups, so (5.39) can be performed consistently.
The equation (5.38) then implies the following particular solution for the spinor,

ms = A1m5(Tc)us u  (y) = e(y)Tc 0 ,

(5.40)

where A15 = d(y) is a locally pure gauge U(1)c configuration because it does not propagate, as F 15 = 0 is required by the integrability condition (5.6). Also, 0 is a constant

spinor. When  vanishes, the Killing spinor  is constant on the sphere.

In general,  is topologically nontrivial and it satisfies    + 2 under the change

of any ym for a period on . The anti-Hermitean generator Tc acts on the spinor, in the

representation

of

gamma

matrices,

as

15

i 2

~1.

Similarly to usual gamma matrices

whose explicit representation by a diagonal matrix ~1 = 3

is 

given in Appendix B, the (~1)us matrix can be represented I2, and it has the eigenvalues ±1. Therefore, we can write

s as a sum of spinors (±)s belonging to positive and negative eigenspaces of ~1,

(~1)us (±)u = ±(±)s ,

(5.41)

showing explicitly that they are antiperiodic on . This is in agreement with the SU(4)  SU(2)+ × SU(2)- × U(1)c decomposition of the spinor charges, as in eq. (D.4).
In this solution, 0 belongs to a negative eigenspace of the 1 matrix and it satisfies the projective relations (5.38). Thus, the final form of the Killing spinor is

=

r 

e(y)Tc

0

,

10 = -0 ,

Ji 0s = (Ti)us 0u .

(5.42)

The corresponding internal field-strength has constant curvature on the transversal

section,

F

~ ij k

e~ie~j Tk

.

(5.43)

28

Similarly as  corresponds to the magnitude of the AdS curvature on , we see that ~ represents, for the given black hole solution, the magnitude of the internal SU(2)D field strength (2.9) restricted to the transversal section . Let us recall that this parameter is defined as ~   - p2, and for black-hole solutions it satisfies ~  , so that the BPS condition (5.17), that holds in the extremal limit p  0, leads to

~ =   p2 = 0  µ = 1 .

(5.44)

Note that, contrary to the -neutral case found in Subection 4.1 which is pure gauge, and where the BPS equation is solved by the vacuum state in Section 5.3, here we find a non trivial solution to the BPS equation, corresponding to the extremal black hole condition µ = 1, where the axial torsion charge C remains completely arbitrary, up to topological considerations that will be discussed in Subsection 6.1.
Let us emphasize that the internal geometry of the three-sphere can be described in terms of torsionless quantities such that

S3 : R~ij = e~i  e~j , T~i = 0 ,

(5.45)

while the torsion and curvature of the transversal section  (with ei| = re~i) are

This solution is a 1/16-BPS state because of the projective conditions on 0 given in (5.42), leaving finally only one (Dirac) supercharge unbroken. A detailed counting of these supersymmetries and an explicit construction of the Killing spinor in a particular representation is given in Appendix E.
To study both BPS and non-BPS solutions and their charges, we will look at a more generic solution with b = 0, not necessarily BPS and not necessarily extremal (p2  0), characterized by the arbitrary, independent charges  and ~, conveniently defined by

 = µ - C2 , ~  R ,

(5.49)

where Ai = Aim(y)dym is any solution with constant F i. It is asymptotically AdS in the Riemannian sector, but the field strength F does not vanish on the boundary, neither in the AdS sector (because of  = 0) or the internal non-Abelian sector (when ~ = 0).
A particular solution for the internal non-Abelian field that admits a BPS limit is

Ai = ~i - B e~i , ~ = 1 - B2  1 ,

(5.51)

where B is the amplitude of the soliton. The upper bound on ~(B) is chosen such that the field strength of this internal field on  is always bounded from above.
Since, with the generalized solution (5.51) for the internal soliton now we have, instead of (5.10), that the parameters are related by

 = ~ + p2 + B2 - C2 ,

(5.52)

the extremality condition (5.44) leads to p2 = 0   = ~ + B2 - C2 ,

(5.53)

and the BPS condition requires equality of the SU (2)D and SU(2)D field strengths and the amplitudes of two solitons, namely,

 = ~ , B = C .

(5.54)

On the other hand, the extremal configurations, defined by eq. (5.53), allow also solutions with  = ~ and B = ±C. Note, however, that only one of the two choices B = ±C corresponds to a BPS state, since the Killing spinor equation, associated with a supersymmetric black hole solution, requires B = C, as summarized by

BPS : µ = 1 , B = C ,  = ~ ,

(5.55)

and corresponding to the values (5.47) and (5.48) of the gauge field and of its field strength. The other choice, B = -C, still corresponds to an extremal solution, but it does not
preserve any supersymmetry:

non-BPS : µ = 1 , B = -C ,  = ~ .

(5.56)

We then find that for this class of black hole solutions, in general the parameter space of extremal solutions (µ = 1 and B, C arbitrary) is larger than the parameter space of BPS solutions (satisfying (5.55)). This is similar to standard supergravity, where the space of extremal solutions is also larger than the space of BPS solutions.

30

Global properties of the Killing spinor. Having obtained local solution at hand, we still have to show that the (periodic or antiperiodic) Killing spinor (5.40)­(5.42) is globally well-defined on , which is locally the 3-sphere. Usually the Killing spinors of black-hole BPS equations include a phase-factor that allows in a natural way to impose antiperiodic boundary conditions. In our case, when the metric manifold does not contain additional fields, there is no room for such phase factors, and the appropriate boundary conditions on the Killing spinor require to carefully choose the global properties of the spatial section .
We will discuss two interesting topological spaces : global S3 that is a simply connected space, and the real projective 3-space, RP3  S3/Z2, obtained from the (parallelizable) 3-sphere by identification of its antipodal points, which is not simply connected.
Understanding of global behaviour of locally S3 topologies is clearer if we reduce the problem to three dimensions, i.e., introduce a 3-dimensional Killing bispinor ~ on the sphere. We use the representation of -matrices (B.12) given in Appendix B and express the left chiral spinors, satisfying 1s = -s, in terms of the bispinor ~s as

s =

0 ~s

.

(5.57)

Then it is interesting to notice that the local 3-sphere admits constant spinor solutions.7
Namely, for Killing spinors neutral with respect to internal gauge symmetries and on a torsionless sphere, a constant spinor on S3 is also a Killing spinor because it can be parallelly transported in a covariant way when topology of the space is RP3.
In our case, this result can be generalized and globally well-defined spinor obtained in both S3 and RP3 due to the presence of both torsion and gauge symmetry. More
precisely, in our solution (5.42), antiperiodic boundary conditions on the Killing spinor are guaranteed, even when the compact space is S3, by the phase factor due to the U(1)c  SU(4) contribution in the gauge sector. However, we could in principle also consider a different Killing spinor solution, corresponding to the other maximal branching SU(4)  SO(4) discussed in Appendix D, where we do not have the phase factor. In this
case, some global identifications seem to be unavoidable to properly define the solution
globally.
To obtain a phase factor that defines boundary conditions of a spinor in a more general case, first we observe that RP3 is not simply connected, because it has fixed points due to
identifications. These allow for the existence of non-trivial paths on the manifold which, in
principle, could lead to either periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions of the spinors.
The same effect (having non-trivial paths) is produced by the torsion field and the internal gauge field in case of S3. To implement the boundary conditions in both cases, we have

A global structure (topology) of the solution on the manifold

determines whether the expression is zero also globally, thus it specifies the boundary

conditions of a spinor. They are explored by defining closed paths  on the considered

manifold. To form a loop  connecting y0 and y and back to y0, we can choose two different paths C, C : y0  y, and define  = C-1  C. Thus, since the space is not simply
connected, the closed path  can either shrink to the point, what would require () = -1

to have appropriate boundary conditions for spinors, or wind around some fixed point of

the projective space, () = 1, classifying possible boundary conditions of the spinor as

(5.60)

The global structure of the Killing spinors is, thus, described as follows.

The 3-sphere manifold : When the manifold is S3, since the 3-sphere is simply con-

nected, when the parallel transport is performed on a pseudo-Riemannian metric manifold,

i.e. without torsion and without internal gauge fields, then there are no `external' ob-

structions and all closed paths shrink to a point, leading always to () = 1 and periodic

boundary conditions. However, when there are additional fields under which the fermion

is charged, such as torsion and internal fields A, they can prevent the paths to shrink,

allowing antiperiodic boundary conditions with () = -1 as well.

Interestingly, the torsion field itself (C = 0, A = 0) possesses non-trivial paths on the

3-sphere. Let us choose the Hopf's coordinates ym = (, 1, 2) on S3, where  

0,

 2

and 1, 2  [0, 2], such that the vielbein and the connection are given by eqs. (F.3) in

Appendix F. Then a closed path that is a circle (y) = S1() leads to the exponential

factor eiC3 in (5.60), using the representation of gamma matrices given in Appendix B.

As we will see later, C is related to an integer n2 according to n2 = C(C2 - 2), implying that this closed path will not always give zero due to C = 0. For example, when C = 1,

8P orders a composition of paths in 1-parameter representation of ym( ) according to the value of the parameter  , e.g., P(C  C) = C  C if   <  .

32

we get () = e-i = -1. Inclusion of the non-Abelian field can further affect the global structure, allowing for non-trivial boundary conditions () = ±1 even in the case of the spherical topology. This is similar to Reissner-Nordstr¨om black hole, where the electric charge produces nontrivial central charge (winding number) in N = 2 supergravity and allows for globally well-defined Killing spinors.

The projective 3-space manifold : When the antipodal points on the 3-sphere are identified, the manifold acquires the fixed points which prevent closed loops to shrink.
This is another reason of existence of non-trivial paths on the projective space, additional to the internal gauge fields and the torsion.
In RP3 space, the spin connection and vielbein can be chosen to globally obey [17]

~i = e~i ,

(5.61)

as a consequence of the fact that isometries of the 3-sphere are locally described by
SO(4)  SO(3)+ × SO(3)-, which allows to set consistently one of two independent connections, say SO(3)+, to zero. This parametrization describes the parallelized RP3, where the 1-form e~i = ~i satisfies the Maurer-Cartan equation of the SO(3)- algebra:

(5.62)

To parameterise the projective 3-space, we will use the Euler angles adapted to parallelized RP3, ym = (, , ), with ,   [0, +2] and   [0, ]. The vielbein is then given
by the expression (G.12). More details are available in Appendix G.

5.3 -neutral BPS black hole
When the black hole is -neutral, then the mass parameter is always positive, µ = C2  0, and the U(1)q-neutral solution of Subsection 4.1 with the 3-sphere radius rescaled to 1 through (5.32), is given by

(5.63)

Formally, this solution can be obtained from the -charged one (5.33) by taking the limit

  0, that is, by setting µ = C2, even if it belongs to a completely independent branch.

Proceeding the same as in the previous subsection, we break the internal symmetry

as SU(4)  SU(2)D × U(1)c and we find that the configuration can be a BPS state only

in the extremal case

p2 = 1 - C2 = 0 , ~ = 0 ,

that describes a pure gauge non-Abelian field,

F = 0 , A = gdg-1 + d(y)Tc , g  SU (2)D .

The solutions satisfying dA = -A2 are purely topological (without the bulk degrees of freedom). Globally well-defined Killing spinors have the form

where the internal field Ai = ~i - B e~i has the constant amplitude B. It is a pure gauge field when ~ = 1 - B2 = 0, corresponding to two different configurations B = 1 with the gauge field Ai± = ~i ± e~i. Interestingly, on RP3, it is explicit that one of these fields identically vanishes (Ai- = 0), while the other one (Ai+) has nontrivial topology.
Note that the above expression, with two independent parameters B and C, is different
from the -charged solution (5.50) that depends on three independent parameters µ, B
and C.

6 Global properties of the solutions
In this section we study physical properties of the solutions, i.e., their charges. Apart from Noether charges which are consequence of continuous symmetries in a theory, there are also topological charges which arise due to topological properties of the solutions defined on spacetime manifold.

6.1 Topological properties

In this subsection we focus on the topological properties of the solutions (5.33) which, in the limit  = ~ = 0 and µ = C2, also include the -neutral ones (5.63). More precisely,

we analyze a static configuration A| on the four-dimensional spatial manifold , whose boundary at the infinity,  = , is a compact topological space of unit radius. We will discuss the cases S3 and S3/Z2 = RP3.
Restricted to t, r = const, the solution (5.50) has non-trivial topology on  and it

where at the end we also have to take the boundary limit, r  . The SU (2)D-part of the AdS field A^i, with the axial torsion C, has the form

A^i = ~i - C e~i ,

(6.2)

and the internal SU(2)D field Ai, with the amplitude B, is given by

Ai = ~i - B e~i .

(6.3)

The torsional soliton A^i and the internal symmetry soliton Ai have the same angular

dependence and different amplitudes, determined by the integration constants C and B.

where we point out again that, above, only a part of the -charge appears in the AdS field strength because F^i is the SU (2)D component of the AdS field A^i, and not the SU (2)D field strength associated to the full AdS field.9 Note that A^i and Ai are pure gauge solutions when C = ±1, B = ±1, but to determine whether they corresponds to
trivial topology with identically vanishing gauge fields, or describe topological solitons, we have to compute their topological charges, which also depend on the global properties
of . The above static solution possesses topological charges obtained from the topological
current Jtop which satisfies F2 | = d(Jtop) locally, and it is also conserved. Globally, it is associated to the Pontryagin topological invariant that takes values on  = , whose corresponding charge is known as the Pontryagin number. It is worth of pointing out that
the topological charge does not have an origin in a symmetry of the action, so the charge exists if the global properties of the solution are such that it is non-vanishing. In our case, as SU(2, 2|4) is broken to SO(2, 4) × SU(2)D × U(1)c, there are several nontrivial topological charges, not necessarily independent.
First we define the total Pontryagin number computed in SU(2, 2|4), which is a real quantity (P  R) [38]

SU(2, 2, |4) :

P =  F2 =

(6.8)

Here  is a normalization constant that depends on the topology of , and which will be determined later. The supertrace · · · is defined using the Cartan-Killing metric, gMN = GmGN given in (A.6) in Appendix A.
On the other hand, due to the non-vanishing third homotopy group 3(SU(2)) = 3(SO(3)) = Z, the Pontryagin indices n1 and n2 associated to the solution (6.1) restricted
to subgroups SU(2)D and SU(2)D, respectively, are integers of the form

when properly normalized. They describe how many times SU(2) and SU(2) wind around
the 3-sphere at the infinity. Therefore, the Pontryagin index for SU (2)D × SU(2)D is also an integer, given by the total winding number

n = n1 + n2  Z ,

(6.10)

9To obtain the usual constant  = µ - C2 in the AdS field strength starting from (6.7), one has to add a contribution from the non-SU (2)D term stemming from [Pi, Pj] = Jij = -[J1i, J1j].

36

because the invariant tensor is such that two terms decouple.
In eq. (6.9), the normalization becomes relevant because it rescales the numbers n1 and n2 to integers. It depends on topology. Similarly as in [38], the normalization in (6.9) has been chosen so that a topologically non-trivial non-Abelian solution which tends to a pure gauge on the boundary (F  0, A  gdg-1) has the winding number |n1| = 1, and similarly for n2. A reason is that SU(2) is geometrically a 3-sphere with invariant volume element proportional to Tr(gdg-1  gdg-1  gdg-1). For our solution, the pure gauge corresponds to ~ = 0. For details of the proof, see for example eqs. (3.18)­(3.20)
in Section 3.2 of [39]. The result for the two topologies considered in this text is

(6.11)

A difference with respect to Yang-Mills theory on the flat background considered in [38] is that, here, the dynamics is governed by the CS action which allows also for non pure-gauge geometries with finite energy in AdS space possessing the axial torsion.
For completeness, we also define the Pontryagin number for SO(2, 4),

SO(2, 4) :

P^ =

(6.12)

which is also a real quantity (not integer).

For evaluation of conserved quantities, we need a coordinate system that parametrizes

the manifold . For the 3-sphere, the Hopf's coordinate frame ym = (, 1, 2) with



0,

 2

and 1, 2  [0, 2] has been introduced in Appendix F, whose vielbein and spin

connection are given by eqs. (F.3). Similarly, the projective 3-plane, due to identification

of its points, satisfies the condition ~i = e~i, and the manifold can be described by the

Euler coordinates ym = (, , ), where ,   [0, 2] and   [0, ]. In this case, the

vielbein has the form (G.12).

The constant  depends on the volume

Vol()

=

1 3!

ijk e~i  e~j  e~k =

d3y e~.

(6.13)

Using the vielbein (F.3), the volume of the 3-sphere is, as usual, Vol(S3) = 22. On the

other hand, the volume of the projective space depends on the choice of the geodesic length

on the manifold, but it is always bounded from above [40]. For the metric choice given in

Appendix

as shown in eq. (G.14).

As an illustration, we write explicitly the form of the internal soliton Ai (and the same holds for the axial soliton A^i, with the replacement B  C) for two topologies. On the

3-sphere, it has the form (see eq. (F.3))

  A2 = -B d ,

S3 :



A3 A4

= - sin  (B d1 + d2) , = - cos  (B d2 + d1) .

(6.14)

37

The integration constant B determines the amplitude of oscillation of particular components of Aim. The fields A^i, Ai become degenerate when C = ±1, B = ±1 because then they depend on two coordinates only (, 1 ± 2). These values of charges correspond to
the pure gauge configurations.

On the projective 3-plane, the internal soliton reads (see eq. (G.12))

RP3 :

(6.15)

To evaluate the topological charges n1, n2, P^ and P , we use the traces constructed in Appendix C. In our case A = A^ + A along the generators Gm = {JAB, TIJ}, and the AdS and internal symmetry contributions decouple because, as shown in Appendix A and Appendix C (see eqs. (A.6) and (C.12))

(6.16)

that implies

P = P^ + n1 .

(6.17)

We observe that two SU(2) subgroups, generated by Ti and Ji, have the Cartan-Killing metrics of the opposite sign as a consequence of the supersymmetry, namely

TiTj = ij ,

JiJj = -ij ,

(6.18)

in agreement with (C.15).

SU(2)D soliton. To understand better the geometry of the full solution, let us focus first on the internal non-Abelian sector, by decoupling the gravitational sector by means
of µ = 0 and C = 0. This is possible by looking at the fixed gravitational background A^ corresponding to the AdS space in spherical foliation, where t, r = const is locally the 3-sphere that satisfies F^ = 0. The gravitational part then vanishes both in the action and in the equations of motion. The Ai(y) field is a solitonic solution of five-dimensional CS
theory for SU(2)D × U(1)c gauge group, defined on the manifold R × , with the U(1)q field being zero on-shell. The U(1)c field does not contribute to the Pontryagin number because 1(S3) = 0 and, as respect to the projective space, although its fundamental group is non-trivial, 1(RP3) = Z2,it is finite-dimensional, thus it cannot describe a usual winding of a soliton. Direct computation is in agreement with this observation.

(6.20)

where the one for the 3-sphere has also been computed in [41]. Note that the winding number of the sphere is an odd function under the reflection transformation B  -B, which only changes a direction of the winding of the soliton around it, n1  -n1. The identification of the antipodal points on the 3-sphere breaks this reflection symmetry. Instead, the transformation B  -B on RP3 produces a shift n1  -n1 + 1. The constant ~ = 1 - B2, however, remains invariant under the reflection in both cases.
The non-Abelian solitons are classified by the Pontryagin index n1, which relates the topological charge n1 and the soliton of amplitude B. Because the topological charge is an integer, this restricts the allowed values of B. Explicitly, we find that B is quantized
by n1 in the following way.

On the sphere, we get: n1(S3) = 0 , n1(S3) = 1 , n1(S3) = -1 , |n1(S3)|  2 ,

where  = 12(-9n1 + 81n21 - 96). For example, the topological sector with ~ = 0

contains pure gauge solutions B = ±1 classified by another particular case, the topological sector with

t~he=w0inadnidngBnu=m0b,er±sn21

= ±1. As has trivial

topology, n1 = 0. In a generic case, the sector with ~ = 0 and nontrivial topology

classified by the integer |n1|  2, corresponds to non-pure gauge solutions.

On the projective plane, we find:

n1(RP3) = 0 , n1(RP3) = 1 , n1(RP3) = 0 , 1 ,

B = 1 , B = -2 , B = -1 , B = 2 , B = ~ 1/3 + ~ -1/3,

positive index n1  2, it can also be written as the reflection symmetry allows now to have the

same |n1|  1 for two different solitonic configurations. When |n1|  2, both RP3 and S3

have a unique soliton for a given topology.

The topological sector with ~ = 0 contains only pure gauge solutions where the non-

Abelian field is A = gdg-1. In that case, when B = 1, the field is topologically trivial

because A = 0 and g = 1. However, when B = -1, it becomes topologically nontrivial. When ~ = 0, there is always only one soliton with given B and nontrivial topology

characterized by the integer n1 = 0, 1. Since the topological charge is conserved and the energy is finite, the evolution cannot

change a solution from one topological sector to another.

SU(2)D soliton coupled to the black hole. Consider now an internal symmetry soliton of amplitude B in the spacetime with axial torsion C and a black hole with the mass parameter µ. The U(1)c field again does not contribute to the topological charges, with the same argument as discussed above. In this case, there is the quantized topological
charge defined in the second line of eq. (6.9), the Pontryagin index associated to SU(2)D. It is computed similarly to (6.20), with the result

n2(S3) = -C 2 - C2 ,

n2(RP3)

(6.21)

Again, the sphere index only changes the sign under a discrete symmetry C  -C, that is n2  -n2, whereas the projective hyperplane index has an additional shift, n2  -n2 -1. It describes an independent SU(2)D soliton of the amplitude C produced by the axial torsion. Thus, there are two solitons, whose charges B and C are related to the topological numbers n1 and n2, respectively, and with the total SU(2)D × SU(2)D Pontryagin index given by (6.10),

n = n1 + n2 =

When the BPS conditions (5.55) are fulfilled, the two solitons satisfy B = C, becoming a soliton and anti-soliton system that unwinds, summing up to a topologically trivial configuration from the point of view of gauge fields,

nBPS = 0 .

(6.23)

The above relation can be seen as a `balance of strengths' between the two oppositely charged solitons, and it reflects the `balance of forces' associated with gravity and internal symmetry which is usual for BPS states in standard supergravity. However, the solution does not possess only SU(2)D × SU(2)D isometries but the extended SO(2, 4) × SU(2)D

(6.26)

In the above expression, the SU(2) charges are quantized by n and the mass parameter p2 = µ - 1 is not. This result is similar to the one in standard gravity where U(1) charges are also quantized and the mass is not.
The expressions (6.26) also shows that the Pontryagin charge P is quantized only in the extremal limit, otherwise it is a real quantity.
The BPS state associated with the full SU(2, 2|4) CS gauge connection, with the parameters satisfying (5.55), is topologically trivial,

PBPS = 0 .

(6.27)

Since P is a conserved quantity, the above relation reflects an exact balancing of the contribution from the topological charge in the Pontryagin term for the AdS and from the internal symmetry parts,

µ = 1 , n1 = -n2 ,

(6.28)

in the CS AdS action at fixed time. This result is non trivial because, as we saw before, the SO(2, 4) gauge fields in CS AdS supergravity are identified with the geometry of spacetime, that is, the spin connection and vielbein of the 5D space-time over which the CS action is integrated. Thus, thinking of the obtained result from the point of view of a black hole in AdS space, it can be read as a no-force condition, as is usual in BPS solutions, reflecting the balance of forces between the geometry and the internal symmetry, similarly as in standard gravity.
As we will see later, the BPS state has all conserved charges equal to zero, that is, it is U(1)q-neutral with zero energy (see, for instance, eqs. (6.58) and (6.58)). It is

41

expected that the obtained BPS condition would saturate the supercharge algebra bound {Q, Q}  0, since a linear combination of the conserved charges appears on the r.h.s. of the inequality.
The results of this subsection also hold for the -neutral black holes after setting p2 = C2 - 1.
6.2 Conserved charges
CS theory is invariant under two sets of local symmetries: the gauge ones with the local parameters (x) and spacetime diffeomorphisms with the parameters xµ = µ(x). Because they are not all independent, the corresponding charges are difficult to find.
In D = 3, the charges and their algebra have been computed in [42]. Since it is on-shell satisfied  = £A, where £ denotes Lie derivative, treating  as the only independent parameter leads to the affine (Kac-Moody) asymptotic charge algebra, whereas treating  as an independent parameter gives rise to the asymptotic Virasoro algebra. They both describe symmetries of a two-dimensional boundary, since the Virasoro algebra can be obtained from two Kac-Moody ones through the Sugawara construction.
In odd D  5, CS gravity is nonlinear in the curvature tensor, and its number of independent local symmetries can change depending on the phase space region. It means that its number of degrees of freedom and the number of physical fields also varies throughout the phase space, taking values from zero to some maximal number in so-called generic CS theories. In addition, in CS theories it is difficult to separate first and second class constraints and prove which ones are linearly independent. This makes a computation of conserved charges very difficult and intrinsically dependent on the background.
There are at least two sets of charges: Q[] associated to gauge symmetries and H[] associated to spatial diffeomorphisms. In [43, 44], these charges have been constructed in CS gravity in asymptotically locally AdS spaces using the Noether theorem. On the other hand, thermodynamic mass for torsionless black holes in AdS space has been found in [45] using Hamiltonian method.
The Nester's formula [46, 47] is useful for finding conserved charges when the torsional degrees of freedom are present. In [48], conserved charges of the five-dimensional BTZ black rings in first order formalism have been worked out, and they in special case reduce to CS gravity. However, a general formula applicable to any CS gravity solution remains unknown.
Bulk degrees of freedom. Hamiltonian formalism provides a systematic way to identify independent local symmetries, determine the number of degrees of freedom and compute the charges in CS theory [49, 50]. It has a particular feature that allows for appearance of accidental symmetries, additional to gauge symmetries and diffeomorphisms, which turn physical fields into unphysical ones and, in that way, eliminate physical degrees of freedom from the theory. The quantity that counts accidental symmetries is the
42

symplectic matrix, (x). In D = 5, the symplectic matrix is defined by [49, 50]

µMN = itµ GM GN F , µ, , . . . = 1, . . . , 4 ,

(6.29)

on the four-dimensional spatial section  corresponding to the slice t = const., and all components along t vanish, tMµN = -µMtN  0. In (6.29), GM are the generators of the SU(2, 2|4) supergroup introduced in Section 2. Due to its dependence on F(x), the rank of (x) varies throughout the phase space [51]. The zero modes of  contain four always-present spatial diffeomorphisms. Any additional zero mode, if it exists, leads to a new accidental symmetry. As a consequence, CS gravity has different number of degrees of freedom in different sectors of the phase space, depending on the number of accidental symmetries present. If D is the dimension of the gauge group, then generic CS theory has the maximal rank of , that is 4D, and minimal number of local symmetries: four spatial diffeomorphisms and zero accidental symmetries. It this case, as we will show later in this section, according to eq. (6.33), the number of degrees of freedom is maximal, D - 2. Most of them are torsional degrees of freedom. The time-like diffeomorphism (the one that defines total energy) is not an independents symmetry, as it is on-shell equal to a gauge transformation. An example of a generic 5D CS theory invariant under G × U(1) has been worked out in [49, 50]. On the other hand, an example of non-generic 5D spherically symmetric and static CS AdS supergravity with torsion and the accidental symmetry U(1) × U(1) × U(1), has been discussed in [18]. It has zero degrees of freedom. Another important example of a non-generic CS theory is a special case of torsion-free Lovelock gravity. Remarkably, a generic sector within this class of non-generic theories has the same number of degrees of freedom as General Relativity [52], that is, D(D - 3)/2 in D dimensions, even when the Einstein-Hilbert term is absent and the gravitational dynamics is described by only one higher-order curvature polynomial [53].
Another effect to take into account is when two existing local symmetries become linearly dependent on certain backgrounds, decreasing a number of local symmetries and, thus, producing more degrees of freedom. The quantity that accounts these regularity conditions (conditions of linear independence of the symmetries) is the Jacobian J (x). When the gauge constraints become dependent in some backgrounds, the theory is said to be irregular [15, 54]. An example of irregular CS AdS5 gravity based on SU(4) × U(1) has been discussed in [15]. In five dimensions, the Jacobian matrix JMN (x) of the canonical gauge generators GM (A, ), is defined by

JMN = i GM GN F .

(6.30)

The generators, satisfying GM  JMN DAN , are linearly independent if the corresponding Jacobian matrix has maximal rank on shell, equal to the dimension D of the gauge
group. Even though the symplectic matrix and the Jacobian matrix components are related by µMN = tµJMN,, their ranks are independent because they act in different spaces. Indeed, there are examples of four different backgrounds corresponding
to different phase space sectors in one CS theory (generic/regular, non-generic/regular,
generic/irregular and non-generic/irregular).

43

In our particular case, D = dim SU(2, 2|4) = 63 but, as shown in Appendix H, the fermionic part of the phase space decouples in the backgrounds considered in this text and, because we set all fermions equal to zero in the solution, there are no fermionic
degrees of freedom left. On the other hand, the bosonic gauge fields are associated to the group SO(2, 4) × SU(2)D × U(1)c × U(1)q of dimension DB = 20. From the solutions at our disposal, we do not discuss the non extremal cases when  = 0 = ~ or  = 0 = ~
because they do not possess BPS states and, in addition, we are not interested in the backgrounds of pure gauge solutions (such as -neutral solution (5.69) with ~,  = 0)
because we know that they do not propagate in the bulk. It remains to analyse only the phase space sector of the -charged solutions (~,  = 0) using the field strength F given by eq. (5.50), which has all components on . Then a non-trivial sub-matrix of JMN has components in AdS group, J[AB][CD], and the interacting terms with the U (1)q field, J1M , where J11 = 0. In addition, although SU(4)  SO(6) also possesses a rank-three invariant tensor, the solution breaks this symmetry to SU(2)D × U(1)c, in which case the symmetric rank-3 tensor of the internal group identically vanishes, implying that the SU (4) sub-matrix vanishes as well, J[IJ][KL] = 0. All the components of the bosonic Jacobian are explicitly written in in Appendix H.
The rank of the Jacobian matrix is determined by examining its zero modes V M ,

JMN V N = 0 .

(6.31)

If the vector V M = (V AB, V ^i^, V c, V 1) (with 20 components) vanishes, the matrix has
maximal rank, i.e., 20. Each zero mode decreases the rank for one. In Appendix H, we showed that there are four non-vanishing components V c, V i5  R, thus the rank of the
Jacobian is rank(J ) = 16.
As regards the 4DB × 4DB symplectic matrix (6.29), its maximal possible rank on  is 76 (when 4 spatial diffeomorphisms are subtracted). The zero modes VµM on  have 80 components and they are non-trivial solutions of

µMN VN = 0 ,

µ  {r, m} .

(6.32)

In Appendix H it is shown that there are 48 zero modes Vrc, Vmc , V ^i^, k - V [^i^, k], Vri5, Vm05, V 0(ij)T , V 1[ij], V 1(ij)T , Vmi5, V ijk - V [ijk], and the rank of the symplectic matrix is rank() = 32.
Knowing the ranks of these two matrices that determine the symmetry structure of
any CS theory, the number of degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) is computed in Dirac's canonical formalism according to the formula

d.o.f .

(6.33)

that will be shown in the next paragraph. In generic and regular theories, both ranks are maximal, that is, rank() = 4(D - 1) and rank(J ) = D, reproducing the known result D - 2 for the number of degrees of freedom [49, 50].

44

In our case, the solution with , ~ = 0 belongs to the non-generic (rank() < 76) and irregular (rank(J ) < 20) sector of CS AdS supergravity, such that

meaning that there are no gauge fields propagating in the bulk geometry around the background of the form (5.50).
Finally, let us comment that our ansatz on the metric (3.1) and torsion (3.3), (3.11) considers only four radial functions, f (r), N(r), (r) and (r), and the internal nonAbelian gauge field represented by the scalar function ~(r), which becomes constant on-shell. Abelian fields are pure gauge. In the branches discussed in Subsections 4.1 and 4.2, we have  = 0, leaving four functions f , N, , ~ when  = 0, or three functions N, , ~ in the -neutral case, whose radial evolution is determined by given initial conditions in first order formalism (satisfying first order differential equations). In addition, we choose boundary conditions such that N = 1. In that way, we remain with three ( = 0) and two ( = 0) functions in the AdS sector, whose radial evolution is determined by the integration constants (µ, B, C) and (B, C), respectively.
However, the constants B and C are quantized by the integers n1 and n2 due to topological considerations, so they are not arbitrary. This leaves the parameter µ as the only integration constant, which is not enough to describe a full degree of freedom because, in the d.o.f. count, two integration constants usually describe one degree of freedom. This result is similar to BTZ black hole in three dimensions, where the mass parameter has topological origin. Furthermore, there is also a similarity with standard supergravity, where the BPS states share the feature that they look like `a half' of a degree of freedom, according to the fact that the BPS conditions are first-order differential equations that, however, imply the second-order field equations of motion. This means that, in our ansatz, we indeed have zero physical degrees of freedom, thus our solutions belong to a topological sector of CS AdS5 supergravity.

Hamiltonian charge formula. In CS AdS supergravity, the SU(2, 2|4) charge can be obtained by Hamiltonian formalism. Separating the time and space coordinates, xµ = (t, x)  R × , the Hamiltonian form of CS action (2.1), up to a boundary term, is [50]

(6.35) (6.36)

Passing to the phase space with canonical variables (AM  , M ), where Mt = 0 and AM t is a Lagrange multiplier, canonical analysis shows that there are two kinds of constraints
(canonical equations of motion that do not involve time derivatives). The first ones are

M = M - LM ,

[M (x), N (x)] = MN (x) (4)(x - x) ,

(6.37)

where the Poisson brackets are taken at the same time, t = t. Zero modes of  correspond to first class constraints that are accidental symmetries. For us, the relevant first class constraint is the one that generates gauge symmetry,

(6.38)

With this constraint content at hand, a number of d.o.f. in 5D CS theory is computed

in Dirac's canonical formalism in the following way. There are D canonical gauge gen-

erators GM (first class constraints), but only rank(J ) of them are linearly independent. There are also 4D constraints M on , and rank() of them are not gauge generators,
but they are so-called second class constraints that eliminate redundant components of

the fields. The rest, 4D - rank(), are gauge generators (diffeomorphisms and accidental

symmetries). In total we have ni = rank(J ) + 4D - rank() first class constraints and nII = rank() second class constraints. Among the 4D gauge fields AM  on  (AM t does not count because it is a Lagrange multiplier), not all correspond to the physical fields.

Each local symmetry generator (first class constraint) eliminates one field component,

and a nature of second class constraints is such that two of them eliminate only one field

component (because a second class constraint can be imagined as first class constraint

plus its corresponding gauge fixing function in the phase space). What remains is the

formula (6.33).

We will compute a formula for conserved charges associated to gauge symmetries. The

smeared generator,

G[] = d4x M GM + Q[] ,

(6.39)



produces gauge transformations via the Poisson brackets, AM  = AM  , G[] = -DM . The boundary term, Q[], has to be chosen so that the generator has well-defined func-

tional derivatives [55].

In order to identify its non-differentiable part, we vary canonical fields, keeping the

gauge parameter field-independent in the asymptotic limit (  0 on  = ). The

bulk terms are constraints and they vanish on-shell, implying that the smeared generator

becomes equal to its boundary term, i.e., the charge G[] = Q[]. Thus, to compute Q[],

it is enough to focus on the boundary terms that arise from making the above expression

free of derivatives acting on A and . Up to explicitly written global sign, we obtain

on-shell

Q[] = ±i

2k

FA

DAA

.



(6.40)

46

Then we apply the Stoke's theorem, noticing that the term containing D also vanishes since D  0 on  (see the conditions on the local parameters, eq. (6.42) below).
The result is the on-shell Hamiltonian charge whose variation is given by the functional

Q [] = 2ik FA ,

(6.41)



where  is an asymptotically covariantly constant parameter that does not vary on the boundary, and  is a global sign chosen as  = 1 when  = 0 and  = -1 when  = 0. This choice,  = 1 - 20 , ensures that the energy, which is always a bounded quantity, becomes bounded from below. The above formula is not integrable in general, i.e., not possible to write as a total variation in general, given boundary conditions for A.
One way to integrate out (6.41) is to use boundary conditions F  F¯, where F¯ is a Liealgebra valued 2-form that does not vary on . The background-dependent charge is then solved as Q ; F¯ = 2ik  F¯A . We can always add an A¯ -dependent `integration constant' to this charge. This approach has been adopted in [16, 49].
The background-dependent method is not suitable when the boundary field depends on the parameters , ~ = 0 because it would introduce background charges. Instead, we will look at a class of solutions where Q becomes integrable.
The parameter  is a Lie-algebra valued function that has to be fixed and covariantly constant on the asymptotic boundary, namely

 : D = 0 ,   0 ,

(6.42)

where D = D(A) is the group covariant derivative, D = d + [A, ]. In our case, non-
vanishing gauge fields are the bosonic ones and since they all commute, the expression becomes a sum of independent terms, D = D^ AdS + D SU(4) + dU(1). This means that, because of independence of generators, each term has to vanish independently. The
same has to be true for each bosonic subgroup in DD = [F, ] = 0.
On the other hand, there is the charge H[] associated to diffeomorphisms, or more precisely to asymptotic Killing vectors  = µ µ describing isometries of the asymptotic sector. Since in D > 3 we have in general F = 0, which implies £A = D(iA)+iF = D and two set of charges (Q [] and H[]) are independent. The exception is the time-like
charge that defines the total energy and where £A and D(iA) become related on-shell. In that case, the parameter  turns field-dependent, still satisfying the conditions (6.42).
The total energy is E = H[t] = Q[0], where the last equality holds on-shell and the function 0(A) is yet to be determined.
The solution of eq. (6.42) in the U(1)q × SU(2)D × U(1)c sector is

1 = 1 , i = 0 , c = 1 .

(6.43)

It means that we can have Abelian conserved charges. In particular, even if the U(1)q field is absent, an effective U(1)q charge might exist due to interaction.

We focus now on explicit computation of conserved charges Qq and E associated to the only two non-vanishing local parameters, 1 given by (6.43) and 0 given by (6.46),
respectively.

Total energy. The total energy of the black hole-soliton system is computed using the formula (6.41),

E = Q[0] = 2ik 0F^A^ .

(6.48)



Since the energy density  is the same for any  which is locally a sphere, the total energy will be of the form Vol(). The internal symmetry soliton and the U(1)c gauge field do not contribute to the total energy because they do not interact with the AdS field directly.

There are several ambiguities in the charge formula that we have to fix. For instance, it is always possible to add an arbitrary variation of an r -dependent function to the above expressions. But if we keep track of all r arising from the supertraces (instead of setting them to zero), we will obtain a natural cancellation of all divergences in the charge. Thus, the r-freedom is fixed by the finiteness of the charge when r  . Lagrangian version of this method requires addition of local counterterms to the action, that has been done in CS AdS gravity without torsion in any odd dimension in [56] by addition of the Euler topological invariant to the bulk action, but it still has an unknown form in a general case.
Another ambiguity lies in the parameter choice, e.g., p2 = µ and (C - 1) = C. The additive constant will be chosen so that the charge Q[] vanishes when its source is absent.10 For example, on the sphere, the solitons are absent when C = B = 0, but on the projective space they are absent when C = B = 1 (because the corresponding topological numbers are zero). As respect to the black hole, the charge is absent when the horizon (4.24) contracts to a point, p2 = 0.
With this method at hand, we compute the following supertraces,

(6.53)

We also applied  = p2 + 1 - C2. The finiteness of the above expression is a non-trivial result, as the charges in AdS spaces are usually divergent in the asymptotic sector and have to be regularized.

10Similar normalization has been chosen in [45], where the additive constant related with the mass has been fixed requiring that the horizon shrinks to a point when µ - 1  0, and the electrically charged solution reduces to the uncharged one when the parameter q  0.

49

In the -charged case, when p2 and C2 are independent parameters, the above expres-

sion is not integrable. To circumvent this problem, we will assume that the axial soliton

has fixed topology, C = 0, so that it becomes a background configuration. This can be

understood from the fact that the Pontryagin index n2(C) is quantized, because then it

(6.54)

We notice that it is always bounded from below for fixed C. Obtained energy includes the mass of the black hole, interaction energy between the
black hole and the axial soliton, as well as the vacuum energy of the AdS space. Indeed, we can write the above result as

E = M + Eint + EAdS ,

(6.56)

The first term (M) is the black hole mass, and the second term (Eint) corresponds to an interaction energy between the black hole and the axial soliton background. The last
term (EAdS) describes the vacuum energy of the AdS space with torsion. When the torsion vanishes, the result matches the known one of the torsionless asymptotically AdS5 black hole [45], where the gravitational energy (which includes the black hole mass and vacuum energy) has been computed using the Regge-Teitelboim method,11

Note that the internal symmetry soliton with the charge B does not curve nor torsion spacetime and it does not contribute to the total energy, as we already observed since the

internal non-Abelian field does not interact with the black hole directly (only through the

U(1)q term). It is a consequence of the fact that SU(2) does not possess a symmetric rank-3 invariant tensor.

The BPS limit of the configuration corresponds to the extremal black hole with µ = 1,

whose energy is

EBPS = 0 .

(6.58)

The same is true for dimensionally continued black holes [8], where the smallest horizon black hole has zero energy. In addition, it is worth pointing out the similarities with the spectrum of supersymmetric black holes in 3D supergravity in AdS [57], which is itself a CS theory. In 3D, the BTZ black hole geometry exhibits maximal supersymmetry in the global AdS3 vacuum, which is the vacuum of the Neveu-Schwarz sector. The vacuum of the Ramond sector is given by the so-called massless BTZ, where the origin represents the topological obstruction that makes possible to fulfill the periodicity conditions for the fermionic fields. Also in the BTZ, as it is usual in supergravity, the BPS configurations represent extremal black holes. Another similarity with the 3D case is the mass gap between the global AdS and the black hole spectrum, a gap that is filled with solutions exhibiting naked singularities. The gap becomes more evident for solutions with weak torsion field (µ >> C2), when the interaction energy can be neglected.
For the -neutral solution, we have p2 = C2 - 1. Since the axial charge is related to the black hole mass, it cannot describe a fixed background. Then the energy (6.53) can be exactly integrated out, leading to

E

=

3kVol() 2

p4,

where we set  = -1, that further yields

(6.60)

and also

EAdS

,

EBPS = 0 .

(6.61)

Again, the energy is bounded from below. In this case, the black hole mass and the inter-

action between the axial soliton and the black hole cannot be distinguished. Furthermore,

the vacuum energy is not computed in a similar way as before, with µ = 0 and C = 0. In

the extremal case, the black hole has zero energy, as expected.

The quantized topological charges n1 and n2 can always be added to the total energy because they satisfy n1 = 0 and n2 = 0. This is a more general property funded on the fact that boundary conditions modify conserved quantities. For instance, in AdS4 gravity, imposing (anti)self-dual boundary conditions on the AdS tensor (on-shell equivalent to

the Weyl tensor), permits existence of solitonic solutions with `magnetic mass', computed

as a Noether charge when the Pontryagin topological invariant is added to Einsten-Hilbert

51

action [58, 59]. In the next step, we will see that there is another conserved charge, Qq, of topological origin.
To conclude, the -neutral solutions have discrete energy spectrum, related to their topological properties. This is also true for -charged solutions in the BPS limit while, out of the limit, the energy spectrum is continuous. These conclusions are similar to the ones in superstring theory where the black p-brane charges [60, 61] appearing in supergravity are associated with the number of coincident D-branes [62] in the underlying string-theory configuration [63, 64, 65, 66] and, therefore, quantized. In the BPS limit the mass, thus, becomes quantized.

Abelian charges. We have two Abelian parameters 1 and c associated to the
symmetry U(1)q × U(1)c. It is straightforward to check that the pure gauge field leads to Qc = 0.
On the other hand, as we discussed before, the U(1)q sector of the theory is strongly coupled when N = 4. Thus, even though the U(1)q gauge field vanishes, its coupling to both AdS and SU(4) fields leads to the effective interaction between them, and produces an effective U(1)q charge associated to the gauge parameter 1 = 1. Using the formula (6.41) and the invariant tensor (2.12) and (2.14), we find

In this case it is always possible to integrate out the charge for any . On RP3, since ~ = e~, natural charges in A^i and Ai are 1-C and 1-B (or equivalently
the integration constant of the variation is fixed so that the solitons vanish when C = 1 and B = 1), so we can write the above variation as

for

components of the Cartan-Killing metric for the N = 4 superalgebra (see eq. (A.6) in

Appendix A and the comment after eq. (2.14)). Thus, the effective charge (6.66) does not

contribute with any new conserved quantity, but itshows a topological origin, similarly as

the electric charge of Reissner-Nordstr¨om black holes in standard supergravity which is

related to the central charge of the corresponding algebra.

On S3, natural charges are C and B (since the solitons vanish when C = 0, B = 0),

and the variation (6.64) is

Qq(S3) = -2 3Cp2 + n1 + n2 + B - C .

(6.67)

The charge is, therefore, proportional to 3n-2P +B -C. Because P and n are topological

numbers, B-C is a conserved quantity directly related to U(1)q symmetry on the 3-sphere. Since the result is exact, it is valid for both -charged and -neutral solutions. The

BPS states in all cases satisfy

QBq PS = 0 .

(6.68)

6.3 Right and left non-Abelian solitons

Properties of CS supergravity depend on invariant tensors associated to its gauge group.

We saw in Appendix C that the subgroups SU(2)D and SU(2)±, when coupled to U(1)c,

have different invariant tensors (compare eqs. (C.13) and (C.16)). Namely, the left and

right groups have an additional non-vanishing component of the rank-3 tensor, that is

gc[±i][±j]

=

±

1 4

ij .

This means that previously discussed solutions, based on the diago-

nal subgroup, could have different physical features if it is replaced by the left of right

subgroup. A purpose of this subsection is to explore this possibility.

Let us consider a solution (5.50) mapped to a nonequivalent one when the non trivial

gauge subgroup SU(2)  SU(4) in the BPS solution is changed as SU(2)D  SU(2)+.12 A new solution on   {S3, RP3} reads

The BPS state is reached when

µ = 1, B = C.

(6.71)

The corresponding Killing spinor has the same form as before, and it satisfies the projec-

tion conditions

1 = - , , Ji = -T+i .

(6.72)

While many features, due to formal equivalence of the solutions, remain the same, an
essential difference is the non-vanishing coupling gc[+i][+j] in SU (2)+ × SU (2)- × U (1)c, so that the U(1)c component could become relevant.
For that reason, and because the total energy, as well as Qq, remain essentially unchanged by introduction of the right soliton, we will focus only on the new charge Qc unrelated to the AdS field, associated to the parameter c = 1, obtained from (6.41) as

Qc

k 2

(6.73)

We can integrate out the charge exactly, arriving to the result

Qc

=

k 2

Vol()(B3

-

3B) +

const ,

(6.74)

where the additive constant is 3k 2 on RP3 (corresponding to Qc  0 when B  1) and it is zero on S3 (corresponding to Qc  0 when B  0). This charge is, therefore, on RP3 proportional to the SU(2) Pontryagin index (6.20), and on S3 it has more complicated

dependence, but in both cases conservation of n1 implies a conservation of Qc. Explicitly,

we have

Qc(RP3) = 2k2 n1 , Qc(S3) = -k2 n1 + B(n1) .

(6.75)

Therefore, the new solution is not equivalent to the old one, as it relates the Hamilto-
nian conserved charge to the quantized topological one associated to the SU(2)+ soliton. Another solution can be obtained in an analogous way using the mapping SU(2)D 
SU(2)-, with similar conclusions.

7 Conclusions
Chern-Simons AdS5 supergravity presents many differences with respect to standard supergravity. The gravitational sector of the former takes the form of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet AdS theory, with the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant being fixed so that the global AdS vacuum is 2-fold degenerate. With addition of torsional fields, local symmetries of this gravity theory become enhanced from the Lorentz to AdS gauge group SO(2, 4). Furthermore, the addition of U(1)q × SU(N ) internal gauge fields and N supersymmetry generators close the supersymmetry algebra off-shell, without necessity of the auxiliary
54

fields [67], such that the number of bosonic and fermionic fields is not the same in general. This is related to the topological origin of the CS theory. Also related to that, the number of propagating degrees of freedom depends on background and, in general, it is not the same as in standard gravity. Still, these two gravity theories have a surprising number of common features, such as existence of black holes [8] respecting the laws of thermodynamics [45].
We show in this paper that more similarities arise in the supersymmetric extension of the theory. We focus on the special case with N = 4 supersymmetries, in which the U(1)q field becomes strongly coupled, fermions turn U(1)q-neutral and the U(1)q sector converts to a central extension. We choose the U(1)q field locally vanishing, but because it interacts with both the geometry and the internal symmetry, it leads to non-trivial global effects.
It is worth mentioning that most results obtained in this manuscript can be generalized to any N  3, when SU(N ) contains an SU(2) × U(1)c subgroup, and the U(1)q field is pure gauge.
New black hole solutions
First we solve the gravitational sector of the theory and find a new class of black hole solutions with the mass parameter µ and the axial torsion charge C. Namely, the torsion tensor restricted to the 3D spatial section, which is locally a sphere, admits the maximal number of Killing vectors. Thus, the 3D space embedded in higher-dimensional geometry is characterised by the axial torsion strength C, whereas the intrinsic torsion of the 3sphere remains zero. The black holes also possess the gravitational hair that modifies the asymptotics of the metric functions gtt, grr compared to standard AdS fall-off. Such black hole has two horizons, and it becomes extremal, with zero temperature, when they coincide.
Other relevant AdS gauge fields in the solution are associated to SU(2)D  SO(2, 4). We find two inequivalent branches of the black holes that differ according to the SU(2)D field strengths . One of them has  = 0, and another is a pure gauge. When  = 0, the mass parameter is not independent from the axial torsion, being µ = C2. In both cases the SU (2)D field is topologically non-trivial and it describes a solitonic solution. Namely, in absence of the gravitational hair (b = b0 = 0), the metric manifold is asymptotically AdS in the standard sense, and the axial torsion can be seen as a scalar field (x) on the curved space satisfying a boundary condition (x)  C. It has properties of a solitonic solution, which we call the axial soliton. In [17], it was shown that the axial soliton preserves 1/2 of the original supersymmetries, and it is therefore a BPS state.
BPS states and conserved charges
In this paper, we also investigate other BPS states and their underlying topological origin for the black hole solutions of CS AdS supergravity. To this end, we consider a solution with a non vanishing internal SU(2)D × U(1)c  SU(4) gauge field, which describes an independent solitonic solution, with amplitude B. We show that the internal and axial solitons have nontrivial winding numbers n1(B), n2(C)  Z, meaning that the
55

constants B and C cannot take arbitrary values, but only the ones fixed by n1 and n2. The total Pontryagin number P  R, which depends on n1, n2 and on the extremality parameter of the black hole, is a conserved quantity. A way to understand why P is not

an integer is that it has an additional term that depends on the mass parameter µ that

appears in the extremality parameter of the black hole.

We compute the conserved charges in the theory, both Noether (due to time-like

asymptotic space-time isometries) and topological charges (due to existence of SU(2)D × SU (2)D soliton). The computations are performed for S3 and RP3  S3/Z2 spatial topologies on the horizon, motivated by the fact that, in absence of internal symmetries and the

axial torsion, the Killing spinor becomes locally constant, so it would in principle not be globally well-defined on (simply connected) S3. It could be so on RP3. This crucial differ-

ence motivated us to investigate the effects of both topologies on the physical properties

of the solution. Nevertheless, as the spinors carry also the U(1)c charge finally, when all
gauge fields are added, both cases discussed in the paper present similar behavior, with the difference being that expressions on S3 possesses an additional reflection symmetry C  -C, absent on RP3 due to identifications.

Another interesting result is that the topological charge P is also an effective charge Qq for U(1)q symmetry on RP3 and, in the case of S3, it leads to a conserved quantity B - C. As respect to the unbroken supersymmetries, we find that the BPS states are reached in

the limit when the internal soliton and axial soliton form a soliton-antisoliton system that

finally unwinds (n1 = -n2), which is achieved by the soliton amplitude matching, B = C, and when the black hole becomes extremal. Thus, similarly as in standard supergravity,

and as expected, BPS states are extremal states. In addition, in both CS and standard

supergravity, the space of extremal solutions is larger than the space of BPS solutions ­

namely, the state B = -C is extremal, but it is not a BPS state.

It is also worthwhile to emphasize important differences between the -charged and -

neutral

cases,

corresponding to

1 16

-BPS

state

and

1 2

-BPS

state,

respectively.

The -neutral

solutions have fully discrete energy spectrum because µ = C2 and C is a discrete function

of n2  Z. This is also true for -charged solutions in the BPS limit, otherwise the energy spectrum is continuous. The last statement resembles the case of the Reissner­Nordstro¨m

black holes in N = 2 supergravity (at least when  = 0), where the U(1)q charge is also a central extension in the superalgebra. Another example are Taub-NUT-AdS and Taub-

Bolt-AdS solutions in AdS4 gravity, whose Noether charge acquires the `magnetic mass' term that is the Pontryagin number [58, 59]. Furthermore, it satisfies (anti) self-dual

asymptotic conditions in the field strength, frequently associated to solitonic solutions.

Finally, motivated by possible (anti) self-duality between the SU(2)+ and SU(2)- internal sectors of the theory, we re-interpret the solution by replacing the SU(2)D internal soliton by the right SU(2)+  SU(4) soliton, where the left one identically vanishes. Although we do not find a duality relation in this simple setting, we prove that in this

case the obtained solution is physically inequivalent from the one studied in detail in this

paper, as it has a new conserved quantity, that is the U(1)c charge Qc, related to the topological number n1(B). In this way, the charge n1 becomes conserved, whereas in

56

the previous solution it was conserved only when combined with n2 and the extremality parameter in P .

Discussion and outlook
An appearance of (anti) self-duality and solitonic solutions in the context of gauge
theories is not sursprising. The well-known example is the Belavin-Polyakov-Schwarz-
Tyupkin (BPST) instanton in the SU(2) Yang-Mills theories, where the Euclidean action is bounded by its pure-gauge value IYM[gdg-1]. The bound is saturated for the (anti) self-dual Yang-Mills instantons, where IYM[gdg-1] becomes proportional to the winding number PYM  Z (Pontryagin index). This is why we expect that, in principle, it should be possible to extend the static SU(2)+ solution sketched in Section 6.3 to the full nonstatic SU(2)+ × SU(2)- one, and realize the (anti) self-duality between the left and right sectors at the level of the CS action, similarly as in Yang-Mills theories. In this case, the
likely topological charge that would play a role in the bound is not the Pontryagin index, but the invariant obtained from ICS[gdg-1]. The same invariant leads to the quantization of the CS coupling constant k in the quantum theory (by requiring the invariance of eiICS also globally), because the CS theory changes under finite gauge transformations, A  g-1(A + d)g, as [6]

(7.1)

where we discarded a (topologically trivial) boundary term. Another task to be carried out is to compute the superalgebra of charges and evaluate
its central extension, as shown in [42] in a simple toy model of generic, regular CS theory. Evaluation of the central charge is important to identify a dual boundary theory, in the framework of AdS/CFT correspondence, studied in higher-dimensional CS gravity in [68, 69, 70, 71, 72]. In particular, the anticommutator of supercharges would lead to the Bogomol'nyi bound, which is saturated on the BPS states in standard supergravity. This method has been applied to global AdS solutions with non-Abelian fields (not black holes) in AdS5 CS supergravity in [16].
Finally, we cannot talk about black holes without knowing their entropy and studying the Hawking radiation via the black hole thermodynamics. The problem is particularly interesting because the found black hole is coupled to two solitons and the configuration is described by three integration constants (µ, B, C) but only two conserved charges (E, Qq) and several topological numbers (n1, n2, P ), where only one of them is conserved (P ). In the case of the right internal soliton, Qc  n1 is an additional conserved quantity.
Related to the entropy, we would also like to understand whether some well-known facts about the black holes in standard supergravity are still valid in the CS theory. For instance, whether the area of the extremal black hole horizon is proportional to (some power of) the black hole entropy. Without torsion, the entropy in gravity with k-fold degenerate AdS vacuum is polynomial in the horizon [45], and this also holds in Lovelock gravity in general [73].

57

Then, the extremal limit in standard gravity is asymptotically reached at the zero
Hawking temperature, where all the energy is lost by thermal Hawking radiation. In
absence of topological charges in the gauge field sector, the minimal energy is zero, thus
the black hole totally evaporates. When a topological charge is present, the minimal
energy is determined by the topological charge, and the extremal limit gives the no-force condition analogous to M = |Qq| for the Reissner­Nordstr¨om black holes. In our case, the CS AdS black holes have non-vanishing Hawking temperature in the non-extremal case,
thus they radiate, and vanishing temperature in the extremal case. And we also found the
associated topological charges. These elements suggest that the usual interpretation of
stable BPS states should also hold in the CS case. However, in order to prove it, we still
have to work out explicitly the Bogomol'nyi bound of the BPS states by diagonalizing the supercharges part of the algebra that is positive definite, {Qs , (Q)u}  0. The topological charge is expected to appear in the superalgebra, such us Qq, Qc or ­ as discussed above ­ the winding number proportional to ICS[gdg-1] of the SU (2)+ × SU (2)- soliton.
Some of the ideas mentioned above are already work in progress.

The five-dimensional gamma matrices a (a = 0, . . . , 4) satisfy the Crifford algebra

{a, b} = 2ab , ab = (-, +, +, +, +) .

(B.1)

They can be constructed from the 4 × 4 four-dimensional gamma matrices (4)a¯, such that a = (a¯, 4) = ((4)a¯,(4) 5), where the last matrix is

4 = (4)5 = i 0123 , 4 = 4 , (4)2 = 1 .

(B.2)

In our conventions, their hermicity can be summarized as

a = 0a0 . Introducing the Levi-Civita as given by eqs. (3.6), we can prove that

(B.3)

Tr (abcde) = -4i abcde .

(B.4)

Tr (a) = 0 , Tr (ab) = 4ab , Tr (abc) = 0 , Tr (abcd) = 4 (abcd - acbd + adbc) .

Let us write out a particular representation of five-dimensional gamma matrices decomposed as a = (0, 1, i), with ab = (-, +, ij), in terms of three-dimensional matrices i. They close the Clifford algebra

{i, j} = 2ij ,

(B.10)

and they can be represented in terms of the Pauli's matrices as i+1 = i. They also satisfy the following identities,

ij = ij I2 + iijkk ,

ij = iijkk ,

(B.11)

where the second one is three-dimensional version of the identity (B.9). Then the representation of five-dimensional -matrices reads

C Generators and invariant tensors of SU (4)

In Appendix A we reviewed a representation of the algebra su(2, 2|N) used in this text. The basic properties and identities of SU(N) generators have been summarized in Appendix of [74].
Here we focus on the special case N = 4. Because of the isomorphism SU(4)  SO(6), the generators of SU(4) can be represented in terms of the gamma matrices ~IJ . Let us write G = TIJ , where  = [IJ] and

TIJ =

I, J = ^0, . . . , ^5 ,

s, u = 1, . . . 4 .

(C.1)

The signature of the group indices I, J is flat and the numeration from ^0 to ^5 is for convenience, stemming from the identification (5.39). Since the Euclidean and Lorentzian indices cannot be confused in this section, we drop writing the hats.13
The so(6) algebra reads

[TIJ , TKL] = ILTJK - JLTIK - IK TJL + JK TIL ,

(C.2)

and the gamma matrices (~i)us are the 4 × 4 matrices satisfying the Euclidean Clifford

algebra

{~i, ~j} = 2IJ , (I, J = 1, . . . , 6) .

(C.3)

All gamma matrices are Hermitean and the generators are anti-Hermitean,

~i = ~i ,

~ I J

[~i, ~j]

.

(C.4)

Using the definition (2.12), and the fact that the supertrace of TIJ and the trace of ~IJ have a relative minus sign, the supergroup symmetric invariant tensor is

g[IJ][KL][M N] = [IJ][KL][M N] ,

g1[I J ][K L]

13 The mapping of the indices I, J = ^0, . . . , ^5  A, B = (0, . . . , 5) and the signatures AB  IJ means that the AdS5 generators with the particular indices 0 and 5 acquire the factor `-i' with respect to the SO(6) generators with the indices ^0 and ^5, so the isomorphism is established via the mapping:

T^0^1  -i J01 , T^1^i  J1i ,

T^0 ^i  -i J0i , T^1^5  -i J15 ,

T^0^5  -J0 , T^i^5  -i Ji .

It is useful to write the following traces of the gamma matrices,

Tr(~i~j) = 4IJ , Tr(~i~j~K~L) = 4 (IJ KL - IK JL + ILJK) , Tr(~i~j~K~L~m~N ) = 4IJ (KLMN - KM LN + KN LM )

where the trace of six gamma matrices, with all indices different, is totally antisymmetric,
and therefore proportional to the Levi-Civita tensor IJKLMN . Its coefficient is evaluated using the identity (B.4) and the isomorphism with AdS5, as explained in Footnote 13. To compute the invariant tensor, we need also

In our settings, we are focused on SU(2) group, which does not possess a rank three symmetric invariant tensor (see Appendix of [74]). In order to acquire a non-trivial rank three tensor, the SU(2) fields have to interact with U(1) fields. This can be achieved in a few nonequivalent ways, which we summarize below.

(i, j, k = 2, 3, 4) and G1.

T0 is missing), giving that the rank-three symmetric tensor is also zero. All non-vanishing

Tr ([i, j] k) = ijk , Tr ({i, j}k) = 0 .

(C.14)

For the supergenerators, these relations become

[Ti, Tj] = -ij kTk , TiTj = ij ,

[Ti, Tj] Tk = -ijk , {Ti, Tj}Tk = 0 .

(C.15)

b) Subgroup U (1)c × SU (2)- × SU (2)+ × U (1)q

This subgroup is an extension of the previous one, with the generators Tc = T15, T±i and G1. Now the non-Abelian generators cover the full range of the indices and they can form non-trivial Levi-Civita tensor. Using the invariant tensor (C.11) with the Levi-Civita
conventions (3.6), and also (C.12), we find the following non-vanishing components,

D Two branchings of SU (4)

The internal symmetry of interest is SU(4), which is the double covering of SO(6). On one hand, the fundamental representation 4 of SU(4) is complex and we label its indices by s, u, . . . = 1, . . . , 4. Then the 15 generators are traceless matrices Ts u (with Ts s = 0) in the 4 (lower index) times ¯4 (upper index). On the other hand, the fundamental representation 6 of SO(6) is real and we label its indices by I, J, . . . = 1, . . . , 6. The 15 generators in this representation are TIJ = -TJI.
SU(4) admits two inequivalent branchings SU(4)  SO(4) (see [34], page 117), which are associated with different black hole solutions. These are:

1) SU(4)  SO(4) irreducibly or, equivalently, SO(6)  SO(3) × SO(3);

2) SU (4)  SU (2)+ × SU (2)- × U (1)c, that is, SO(6)  SO(4) × SO(2)c.

In the first branching, the (complex) fundamental representation 4  SU(4) goes into the (real) 4  SO(4)  SU(2)+ × SU(2)- irreducibly, that is,

4  (2, 2) ,

(D.1)

which implies in terms of both the representation and the corresponding indices,

6  (3, 1) + (1, 3) , I  (i, ~i) , i, ~i = 1, 2, 3 .

(D.2)

The adjoint representation, similarly, decomposes as

15  (3, 1) + (1, 3) + (3, 3) .

(D.3)

From the point of view of the generators, the above decomposition is realized in the 4 as Ts u  T[su], which are the generators of SO(4), and in the 6 we have instead TIJ  Tij + T~i~, which are the generators of SU (2)± respectively.
In the second, different, branching of SU(4), there is an additional Abelian group that assigns the U(1)c weight to each representation, which we denote as a subscript. Then the 4  SU(4) decomposes into

4  (2, 1)+1 + (1, 2)-1 ,

(D.4)

where the first item in the brackets is the dimension of the SU(2)+ representation and the second one is the dimension of the SU(2)- representation. In components, we have that the (complex) index u = 1, . . . , 4 decomposes into u = (, ~), where ,  = 1, 2 label

the fundamental representations of SU(2)+ and of SU(2)- respectively, carrying opposite charges ±1 with respect to U(1)c.
For the 6, we have

6  (2, 2)0 + (1, 1)+2 + (1, 1)-2 ,

(D.5)

64

which can be realized by the decomposition (as we do in the main body of the paper)

I  (0, 1, i, 5), with i = 2, 3, 4, where the fundamental representation of SO(4) is spanned

by the indices (0, i) while the indices (1, 5) span SO(2)c. For the adjoint, similarly, we

obtain

15  (3, 1)0 + (1, 3)0 + (1, 1)0 + (2, 2)+2 + (2, 2)-2 .

(D.6)

Finally, for the generators in the 4 we now find Ts u  T +T~~ +T , generating SU (2)+ × SU (2)- × U (1), where T and T~~ are symmetric and traceless and where the U (1)c generator is T  T = -T~~. For the generators in the 6 we have, instead, TIJ  T0i + Tij + T15, where the combinations

E Counting of supersymmetries

Here we prove that the Killing spinor for the -charged solution (5.47) has 1/16 of unbroken supersymmetries.
We focus on the constant part of the spinor, in the text denoted by 0, but we drop the index 0 in this appendix for the sake of simplicity. Using the representation (B.12) of the 1 matrix, the projection 1s = -s leaves, for each s, just a half of spinor components,

s =

0 ~s

, i s =

i~s 0

,

s = 1, . . . , 4 ,

(E.1)

where we wrote is represented in (B.13) because we will need it in the next step. Now we have to check, when  = 0, how many supersymmetries breaks the condition

(5.38) written as

(i) s = (~i)us u .

(E.2)

Because the spatial and spinorial indices are mixed up, we will write s  s as a 4 × 4 matrix H, where each column has fixed group index s, namely

H = [s] =

00 AB

,

(E.3)

and A = (~1 ~2) and B = (~3 ~4) are 2 × 2 matrices with the spinorial indices  = 3, 4, which are exactly the left chiral (0, 1/2) indices that can also be denoted by a = 1 , 2 . Then the matrices can be written explicitly as

A=

~11 ~12 ~21 ~22

,

B=

~13 ~14 ~23 ~24

.

(E.4)

65

Thus (i) s = (iH)s and (~i)us u = (HT ~i)s can be expressed just as products of matrices, leading to

iH = HT ~i 

0 i i 0

00 AB

=

0A 0B

0 ~i ~i 0

,

(E.5)

where we represented ~i analogously to (B.13), that is ~i = ~1  ~i. The above condition

becomes

iA iB 00

=

A~i 0 B~i 0

 iA = A~i , B = 0 .

(E.6)

The fact that B = 0 means that a half of the remaining components are further projected

out, ~3a = 0 and ~4a = 0, leaving only 1/4 of the original components denoted by as, with a = 1 , 2 and s = 1, 2, which are 4 complex numbers.
The last set of the conditions to be analyzed is (i)ab Abs = Aas (~i)su . Here tilde just means that the Pauli matrices ~i act by the right, and i by the left, so this statement is the condition that A has to commute with all Pauli matrices. Using the Schur's lemma that

says that the only matrices commuting with a finite-dimensional irreducible representation

of a group, SU(2) in this case, are the scalar matrices, implies that A is a scalar, i.e.,

proportional to I2. Therefore, only while ~12 = ~21 = 0, cutting further

one the

component, ~11 = ~22 survives number of supersymmetries to

the last 1/4. As

condition, a result, a

pair of dependent spinors 1 and 2 remains non-vanishing, where either both are different

than zero or both are zero, because they are proportional to the same complex Grassmann

number ~11. Note that a different choice of the SU(4) basis could transform it to only

one spinor.

In sum, accounting all projection conditions in the considered representation leaves

1/16 of the original supersymmetries unbroken, given by the Killing spinors of the form

F Coordinates on the 3-sphere

The 3-sphere can be described in the Hopf's fibration, with the angles ym = (, 1, 2) 

0,

 2

× [0, 2] × [0, 2], where S3 is embedded in R4 through [75]

Y 1 = cos 1 sin  , Y 3 = cos 2 cos  ,

Y 2 = sin 1 sin  , Y 4 = sin 2 cos  .

(F.1)

66

It satisfies the unit 3-sphere equation pqY pY q = 1, whose metric is

d2 = pq dY pdY q = d2 + sin2  d21 + cos2  d22 .

(F.2)

For any fixed value of , the coordinates (1, 2) parametrize a 2-dimensional torus. When  = 0 and /2, these tori reduce to circles.
The vielbein and the spin connection of the 3-sphere in the Hopf's coordinates are

e~2 = d ,
e~3 = sin  d1 , e~4 = cos  d2 ,

~2 = 0 ,
~3 = - sin  d2 , ~4 = - cos  d1 .

(F.3)

What we call the volume of the above three-dimensional geometry is

G Real projective 3-space

The real projective 3-space, RP3, is the quotient space S3/Z2 of a 3-sphere, obtained by identification of its antipodal points, S3/(x  -x). Equivalently, it is the quotient space of a half-sphere, i.e., solid 3-disc D3 with antipodal points of D3  S2 identified [76]. In that way, each open hemisphere in S3 becomes disjoint from its antipodal image.
A double covering of the sphere, used for the above identification, can be written as the quotient S3  Gisom/SU (2)hol of the isometry group Gisom  SU (2)+ × SU (2)- and the holonomy group SU (2)hol  Gisom. A choice of the latter defines the topology and the connection defined on it. In what follows we will construct S3 and RP3.
The Killing vectors generating Gisom satisfy

[±i, ±j] = -ij k ±k ,

[+i, -j] = 0 ,

(G.1)

that can also be expressed in terms of the left-invariant 1-forms ±i of the isometry group, defined by their action on the generators,

+i (+j) = ji , -i (-j) = ji , ±i (j) = 0 , d±k (i±, ±j) = -±k ([±i, ±j]) = -ij k .

(G.2)

67

This is equivalent to saying that ±i satisfy the Maurer-Cartan equations,

d±i

-

1 2

i

jk

±j



±k

=

0.

(G.3)

To represent Gisom in terms of its Killing vectors, we embed the 3-sphere of radius a in R4 using the radial foliation (a, ym),

d2 = da2 + a2d2 ,

d2 = mn(y) dymdyn ,

(G.4)

with the vielbein ep = (e1, ei) and the corresponding Levi-Civita spin connection given by

e1 = da , ij = ij k ~ k(y) ,

ei = a e~i(y) , 1i = -ei .

(G.5)

Here e~i and ~i are intrinsic quantities of S3 in the coordinates ym, with the intrinsic curvature 2-form R~i = ijk e~j  e~k and the intrinsic torsion 2-form T~i = 0. The unit 3-sphere S3 is obtained from R4 by setting da = 0, a = 1.
In this basis, the isometries of the 3-sphere are described by the six Killing vectors pq = -qp = pmqm which satisfy the so(4) Lie-bracket algebra,

[pq, pq ] = pq qp - qq pp - pp qq + qp pq .

(G.6)

We can decompose and redefine these Killing vectors as

pq = (1i, ij)  (+i, -i) ,

(G.7)

to establish the isomorphism Gisom  SO(4)  SO(3)+ × SO(3)-. Then the SO(3)± isometries are described by the Killing vectors,

±i

=

1 2

(i

±

i1) ,

ij  ij kk ,

(G.8)

which satisfy the algebra (G.1). To obtain S3, we choose SU (2)hol  SU (2)D as the diagonal subgroup of Gisom, whose
connection and the vielbein are associated to the ones of the 3-sphere,

~ i

=

1 2

(+i

+

-i ) ,

e~i

=

1 2

(-i

-

+i )

,

(G.9)

or equivalently

±i = i ± 1i = ~ i  e~i .

(G.10)

Indeed, in terms of ~i and ei, eqs. (G.3) become the conditions of constant curvature R~i and vanishing torsion T~i of the 3-manifold. Unlike ±i , the connection ~i has a non vanishing curvature, corresponding to the fact the SU(2)D is a local symmetry on S3. This choice reproduces the radial foliation described in (G.5).

68

We can choose, instead, one of the SU(2)± factors as a holonomy group, say SU(2)+, such that S3  SU(2)-. With this choice, only a subgroup SU(2)-  SO(4) of the isometry group is manifest, so that only -i acts on the quotient space RP3, while +i has
the corresponding gauge connection set to zero

+i = 0  ~ i = e~i , -i = 2~i = 2e~i .

(G.11)

To show that obtained topological space is indeed RP3, note that the left-invariant 1-form e~i are dual to the generators ~i such that e~i(~j) = ji. Their algebra can be read off from the structure constants in the Maurer-Cartan equations satisfied be the left-invariant forms ~i, finding that the isometry group is indeed restricted to SO(3) = SU(2)+/Z2, that is precisely the one of RP3, when it is written as a parallelized manifold [40].
It remains to find an explicit coordinate frame for this qotient space. Since -i is a pure gauge connection, e~i(y) can be constructed using -i J~-i = gdg-1, where g(y)  SO(3)- and [~J-i, J~-j] = -ij kJ~-k. One possible parametrization of the SO(3)- group element is in terms of the Euler angles ym = (, , )  ( + 2,  + ,  + 2) such that
g = Rz()Ry()Rz(), leading to the vielbein

H Degrees of freedom count

In this Appendix we evaluate the rank of the Jacobian matrix 2-form

JMN = i GM GN F = gMNK F K ,

(H.1)

and the symplectic matrix

µMN = itµ GM GN F = tµ gMNK FK ,

(H.2)

for the -charged solution (5.50), for purpose of computing the number of d.o.f. in the

theory around a certain background. The matrix elements of these two tensors are related

by

µMN = tµ JMN, ,

(H.3)

but they act in different spaces, so the rank of one matrix is not related to the rank of another matrix.
We use the -charged solution given by eq. (5.50),

(H.4)

We do not discuss the cases when  = 0 = ~ or  = 0 = ~ because they do not possess BPS states, and we also omit the -neutral solution (5.69) with ~,  = 0 because it is a pure gauge. In addition, the matrices (H.1) and (H.2) do not have mixed bosonicfermionic terms so that the purely fermionic sub-matrix decouples from the bosonic one, and because at the end we take all fermions equal to zero, the fermionic degrees of freedom vanish. This is why we will consider only the bosonic submatrices of (H.1) and (H.2), corresponding to the gauge group SO(2, 4) × SU(2)D × U(1)c × U(1)q whose dimension is DB = 15 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 20.

70

Let us evaluate first the bosonic components of the 2-form (H.1). In the pure AdS sector, it corresponds to the symmetric 15 × 15 Jacobian matrix,

Next, the Jacobian matrix with SU(4) indices identically vanishes because this group is broken to SU(2)D × U(1)c which, according to (C.13), does not have a rank-3 symmetric invariant tensor and the U(1)q field strength is zero. As regards the U(1)q interaction, using (2.12) and (C.13), we find the components

where we denoted the internal symmetry indices by ^i, ^ in the Jacobian, not to be confused with the AdS ones, i, j.
Zero modes of the Jacobian are determined from the algebraic equation

0 = JMN V N ,

(H.8)

where DB = 20 is the maximal rank of the 20 × 20 Jacobian matrix JMN , and each non-vanishing component of the vector field V m = (V AB, V ^i^, V c, V 1) decreases this rank
for one. It is straightforward to show that, because JcM = 0 and U(1)c field is the pure gauge, the component V c  R remains arbitrary, presenting one zero mode of the
Jacobian. Keeping this in mind, the above equations can equivalently be written as

71

to the zero modes of the matrix. As a result, the system reduces in equations in V AB components, J[AB][CD]V CD = 0, which can also be written as
