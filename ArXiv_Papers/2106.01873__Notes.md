## Abstract

In the framework of Balasko's theory of Equilibrium Manifold in a Pure Exchange Market Economy, we introduce the concept of crisis and unavoidable crisis equilibrium, establishing some infinitesimal criteria which allow us to distinguish the unavoidable crisis from a general critical equilibrium. The proofs build on the relationship between the mathematical concepts of branching, envelopes, and the intrinsic derivative.
