## Abstract

We propose an axion model with the ${\rm SU}(6)$ unification symmetry. Such a unification model can lead to an automatic global ${\rm U}(1)_{\rm PQ}$ symmetry from two copies of anti-fundamental fermions. The ${\rm SU}(6)$ is first broken to the extended symmetry of ${\rm SU}(3)_c\otimes {\rm SU}(3)_L \otimes {\rm U}(1)_N$, and the Higgs fields for the sequential symmetry breaking contain the physical axion fields. The low-energy theory at the electroweak scale is described by the type-II two-Higgs-doublet model. The physical axion satisfies the Peccei-Quinn quality condition without much fine-tuning of the dimension-6 operator, with the mass range of $\sim {\cal O}(10^{-3} ) - {\cal}(0.1) \,{\rm eV}$. The axion-photon coupling of $g_{a \gamma\gamma}$ is identical to the type-I DFSZ scenario, and can be probed in the upcoming axion search experiments of LAMPOST and IAXO in the high mass region.
