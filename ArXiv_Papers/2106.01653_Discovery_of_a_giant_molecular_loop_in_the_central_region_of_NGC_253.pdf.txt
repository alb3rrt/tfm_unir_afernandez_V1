ABSTRACT NGC 253 is a starburst galaxy of SAB(s)c type with increasing interest because of its high activity at unrivaled closeness. Its energetic event is manifested as the vertical gas features in its central molecular zone, for which stellar feedback was proposed as the driving engine. In order to pursue details of the activity, we have undertaken a kinematic analysis of the ALMA archive data of 12CO(J=3­2) emission at the highest resolution 3 pc. We revealed that one of the non-rotating gas components in the central molecular zone shows a looplike distribution of 200 pc radius. The loop is associated with a star cluster, whereas the cluster is not inside the loop and is not likely as the driver of the loop formation. Further, we find that the bar potential of NGC 253 seems to be too weak to drive the gas motion by the eccentric orbit. As an alternative we frame a scenario that magnetic acceleration by the Parker instability is responsible for the creation of the loop. We show that the observed loop properties are similar to those in the Milky Way, and argue that recent magnetrohydrodynamics simulations lend support for the picture having the magnetic field strength of 100 µG. We suggest that cluster formation was triggered by the falling gas to the footpoint of the loop, which is consistent with a typical dynamical timescale of the loop 1 Myr.

Star formation activity heats up and ionize the surrounding gas and promote galactic evolution thereby. Because star formation takes place in the molecular clouds, observations of the molecular gas is a crucial step in understanding galactic evolution. In the Milky Way, the gravitational potential of the galactic center within 1 kpc is about ten-times deeper than in the galactic disk, and the material in the galactic center is subject to stronger compression. It is possible that such compression affects star formation in the galactic center but not so in the galactic disk. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the physical conditions like gas density, gas temperature, magnetic field etc. in order to elucidate galactic evolution. It is also known that the gas temperature and the gas velocity dispersion are ten times higher in the galactic center than in the galactic disk (e.g., Morris & Serabyn 1996; Martin et al. 2004), whereas their origin remains veiled.
The starburst galaxies show extremely active star formation and the feedback effects including the stellar winds and supernova explosions (SNe) influence the surroundings dynamically (e.g., Sakamoto et al. 2006; Bolatto et al. 2013). Especially, NGC 253 is one of the nearby galaxies is forming a number of high mass stars in the central region (e.g., Ando et al. 2017; Leroy et al. 2018) and discoveries of supershells which are formed by stellar feedback (e.g., Sakamoto et al. 2006) and starburst outflow (e.g., Bolatto et al. 2013) have been reported.
NGC 253 is therefore an important galaxy in our efforts to understand galactic evolution driven by starburst. With the Submillimeter Array, Sakamoto et al. (2006) observed the 12CO(J=2­1) emission in the central part of NGC 253 at a angular resolution of 4 , corresponding 70 pc at a distance of 3.5 Mpc (Rekola et al. 2005), and discovered two supershell-like features of 10 diameters (SB1, SB2) which are separated by 300 pc from the center along the central bar-like distribution. By assuming the expansion velocity, the authors estimated the kinetic energy of 1053 erg in each shell, and suggested that 100 SNe, which corresponds to a cluster mass of 106 M , are required to feed the expansion energy if a single SNe releases 1051 erg.
On the other hand, Sakamoto et al. (2011) failed to detect SB1 in subsequent observations at 2 , while Krieger et al. (2019) confirmed SB1 in the 12CO(J=3­2) emission at 0. 2 which was named "western-superbubble" in 260 ­ 340 km s-1.
Most recently, Bolatto et al. (2013) used the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) toward the central part of NGC 253 in 12CO(J=1­0) emission at 3 and discovered vertical "outflow" which is likely driven by the starburst. Such an outflow has a bipolar distribution normal to the plane, and its origin is assumed to be the hot gas accelerated by SNe in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) and escaped toward the low density region outside the plane. The amount of the gas outflowing is estimated to be 3 ­ 9 M yr-1, and is five times larger than the star formation efficiency 1.7 ­ 2.8 M yr-1 (Ott et al. 2005; Leroy et al. 2015; Bendo et al. 2015). Subsequent multi-line observations obtained additional estimates of the outflow rate to be 25 ­ 50 M yr-1 (Zschaechner et al. 2018) and from ALMA 12CO(J=1­0), 12CO(J=2­1) and 12CO(J=3­2) observations to be 3 ­ 39 M yr-1 (Krieger et al. 2019).

Krieger et al. (2019) extracted gas in the CMZ to two components which consist of the component with the circular motion and the others. The masses of the circular and noncircular motion are estimated 3 × 108 M , and 5 ­ 6 × 107M , respectively. The non-circular gas was further divided into the outflow, western-superbubble, and the "others disk" and their masses are estimated to be 3 ­ 4 × 107 M , 8.9 × 106 M , and 7 × 106 M , respectively. The kinetic energy of the outflow is estimated to be 3.9 ­ 4.5 × 1054 erg over 1 Myr, which approximately corresponds to that supplied by the stellar feedback. The authors therefore argued that the outflow is explained as caused by the stellar feedback. The other non-circular gas other than the outflow however remains unexplained.
Similar non-rotating components are observed in the CMZ of the Milky Way and are interpreted as due to the bar potential (Binney et al. 1991) or the floatation by the magnetic instabilities (Fukui et al. 2006; Machida et al. 2009; Suzuki et al. 2015). Fukui et al. (2006) discovered two molecular loops which are floating from the plane by 200 pc with total length of 500 pc and width of 30 pc by the NANTEN Galactic plane survey 12CO(J=1­0). The footpoints of the loops are bright in CO emission and show large velocity dispersion of 50 km s-1 which is five times larger than that in the disk. The velocity distribution of the loops cannot be explained by the acceleration by the SNe, and the authors interpreted that the loops were created by the Parker instability (Parker 1966). The gas in the loop falls down to the footpoints along the magnetic field lines, which heats the gas and excites turbulence in the footpoints. The magnetic field strength to create the loops is estimated to be 0.15 mG by assuming that the field is in energetically equipartition with the gas motion. The strength is comparable to the estimate field strength 1-10 mG (e.g., Morris & Serabyn 1996). It is suggested that the magnetic instabilities take place ubiquitously in the galactic center as shown by magnetro-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations (Matsumoto et al. 1988; Machida et al. 2009; Suzuki et al. 2015).
In addition, loop-like gas distribution was found based on B-band observations in the central region of NGC 253, and its origin was proposed as due to the magnetic flotation (Sofue et al. 1994). In spite of such work, the detailed gas dynamics in the CMZ of NGC 253 has not yet been understood. This was in part due to the limited spatial resolution in the past, which was not high enough to resolve 10 pc features of supernova remnants (SNRs) and magnetic loops such found in the central region of the Milky Way. This situation is being overcome thanks to ALMA which allows us to resolve molecular clouds at 5 pc resolution on NGC 253. This paper presents an analysis of the gas kinematics in the central region of NGC 253 using the ALMA Cycle-1 12CO(J=1­0) and Cycle-3 12CO(J=3­2) data, and explore the origin of the gas with non-circular motions in the region. 12CO(J=1­0) was used to derive the total gas mass and the higher excitation transition line 12CO(J=3­2) was used to reveal detailed gas kinematics. We adopt a distance of NGC 253 to be 3.5 Mpc, where 1 corresponds to 17 pc (Rekola et al. 2005) and the galactic center was taken as J2000 0h47m33.12s, -25d17m17.59s (Best et al. 1999) and its velocity 243 km s-1 (Koribalski et al. 2004). We give the observational data in Section 2 and the results

in Section 3, discussion on the gas with non-circular motion is made in Section 4, and conclusions are given in Section 5.
2. OBSERVATIONS & DATA REDUCTION
2.1. Datasets
The datasets were observed toward the CMZ of NGC 253 with ALMA under the Cycle 1 in Band 3 (project code: 2012.1.00108.S, PI: A.Bolatto) and under Cycle 3 in Band 7 (project code: 2015.1.00274.S, PI: A.Bolatto). The details of the datasets are presented in Table 1.
The dataset in Band 3 are tuned the lower side band (LSB) to 101.7 ­ 105.4 GHz and the upper side band (USB) to 118.8 ­ 113.7 GHz and 113.8 ­ 115.6 GHz which covered the frequency of 12CO(J=1­0) emission. The total bandwidth is 7.5 GHz and the frequency resolution is 488.3 kHz (corresponding to the velocity resolution of 3 km s-1). The dataset consists of the 12 m array (C32-2) with seven pointings at 2 kpc of the CMZ of NGC 253, the 7 m array with three pointings at 2 kpc of the CMZ of NGC 253 and the total power (TP) array. The baseline of the 12 m array and ACA are 15 ­ 463 m and 7 ­ 49 m respectively. The calibrator were J0334-4008 for bandpass, J0038-2459 for phase and Uranus for flux. The visibility of the 12 m configuration data is calibrated using Common Astronomy Software Application (CASA) 4.2.2 and the calibration script prepared by the ALMA observatory. The visibility of the 7 m array is calibrated using CASA 4.2.0 and the calibration script prepared by the ALMA observatory.
The dataset in Band 7 are tuned the LSB to 342.0 ­ 345.8 GHz, which includes 12CO(J=3­2) emission line and the USB to 353.9 ­ 357.7 GHz. The total bandwidth and the frequency resolution is 7.5 GHz and 976.6 kHz, respectively (corresponding to the velocity resolution of 0.8 km s-1). The dataset consists of a 12 m extend configuration and the 12 m compact configuration (hereafter 12E and 12C) with four pointings at 0.8 kpc toward the center of NGC 253, the 7 m array ACA with five pointings at 1.0 kpc of the center of NGC 253 and TP. The baseline of the 12E, 12C and the 7 m array are 15 ­ 1813 m, 15 ­ 784 m, and 9 ­ 49 m, respectively. The calibrator were J0006-0623 for bandpass, J0038-2459 for phase and Pallas for flux. The visibility of 12C is calibrated using CASA 4.6.0 pipeline and the calibration script prepared by the ALMA observatory. The visibility of the others are calibrated using CASA 4.7.2 pipeline and the calibration script prepared by the ALMA observatory.
2.2. Imaging
For 12CO(J=1­0), we subtracted the continuum component from the 12 m configuration and the 7 m array visibilities using the task of uvcontsub in CASA 5.4.0 and we ran the task of tclean to image cube map of the 12 m configuration and the 7 m array with the Briggs weighting scheme with a robust parameter of 0.5. We combined the 12 m configuration, the 7 m array and TP by using the task of feather, and we obtained a 12CO(J=1­0) cube with an angular resolution of 1. 6 × 1. 2. The data was gridded to be the spatial grid size of 0. 3 and a velocity grid size of 5 km s-1.

NOTE--TP is a total power array which cover largest spatial distribution of emission lines. We referred an angular and velocity resolution from the images which are not smoothed. We derived line sensitivity from root mean square of noise at non-emission regions.

For 12CO(J=3­2), we ran the task of tclean to make a cube of 12E, 12C and ACA with the Briggs weighting scheme with robust parameter of 0.5, and we subtracted the continuum component using the task of imcontsub. We combined all four datasets by using the task of feather, and finally obtained a 12CO(J=1­0) cube with the angular resolution of 0. 18 × 0. 14. The data was gridded to be the spatial size of 0. 03 and the velocity element of 2 km s-1 .
2.3. Rotating position angle of the CMZ of NGC 253
In this paper, we focus on gas dynamics in the CMZ of NGC 253. In order to compare relative velocity and height of the gas in the CMZ, we adjusted the position angle and velocity of the data. We rotated the position angle of 55(Krieger et al. 2019) to 90 and subtracted the systemic velocity of 243 km s-1 (Koribalski et al. 2004). Figure 1 shows gas distributions in equatorial coordinates to compare those identified by the previous studies. The subsequent figures shows the processed data.
3. RESULTS
3.1. Distribution of high excitation gas
We investigate spatial-velocity distribution of molecular gas with the higher resolution and higher transition gas tracer, 12CO(J=3­2).
Figure 1 shows velocity channel distribution of 12CO(J=3­2) emission from Vlsr = 100 km s-1 to 450 km s-1. A main body of molecular gas is seen in the northeast of the galactic center at Vlsr = 100 km s-1, and this gas extends over the galactic center at Vlsr = 150 km s-1 to 200 km s-1. The gas centered on the galactic center and symmetrically spreads over more than 300 pc from the northeast to southwest at the vicinity of systemic velocity of the galaxy, 243 km s-1. The gas moves to the southwest in Vlsr = 300 ­ 400 km s-1 and disappears toward the southwest at Vlsr = 450 km s-1. As a whole the gas with the brightness temperature above 10 K exhibits a clear rotating disk: linearly extends from the northeast to southwest of the galactic center and red-shifts in the northeast and blue-shifts in the southwest. We hereafter call this main gas stream disk component.

Directions of OFFSET X and OFFSET Y axes are shown at upper right corner of 50 km s-1 channel, and the intersection of these axes is corresponding to the center of NGC 253. The original synthesized beam (black) and the 10 × zoomed beam (white) are indicated at lower left corner of 300 km s-1 channel. The region of the loop structure and the disk component at 400 km s-1 are indicate as the red and white rectangles, respectively. An yellow line shows an intermediate line of the short side of the red rectangle. The position of western-superbubble(Krieger et al. 2019) is shown in the panel at Vlsr = 400 km s-1.
At Vlsr = 400 km s-1 three molecular structures are seen. The northern structure is a part
of western-superbubble discovered by Krieger et al. (2019) and the southern one is a part
of the disk component which shows the galactic rotation and connect to the galactic center gas at Vlsr = 300 ­ 350 km s-1. The central gas structure indicated by the red rectangle in Figure 1 appears at Vlsr = 350 km s-1 and shows a loop-like structure, which extends from
the vicinity of the galactic center and connects to the disk component at its southwest end at Vlsr = 400 km s-1. The disk component is located toward the same region at Vlsr = 250 ­ 300 km s-1, meaning the loop has higher velocity than the disk. The length, width, and

height of the loop are 300 pc, 50 pc, and 20 pc, respectively. For the following we focus on this loop showing a peculiar velocity.

Figure 2. (a) Position-velocity diagram of 12CO(J=3­2) integrated whole the loop width of 85 pc. The axis of OFFSET X is horizontal the position angle of the CMZ of NGC 253 of 55(Krieger et al. 2019). The white solid line indicates the circular rotational velocity component delineated by eye-fit. Dashed lines indicate velocity range for the loop. Two rectangles indicate eastern and western footpoints. Contours are drawn at 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5, 15.0, 17.5, 20.0, 22,5 and 25.0 K. (b) Position-velocity diagram of 12CO(J=3­2) toward the direction of the loop's center with the integrated slice width of 5 pc. The white solid line and dashed lines are same as Figure 2a. Three arrows indicate the directions of high velocity cloud components.
Figures 2a and 2b show position-velocity diagrams of 12CO(J=3­2) emission toward the loop with the integrated ranges corresponding to the red rectangle (whole the loop structure) and the yellow line (a slice of the center of the loop) in Figure 1, respectively. The OFFSET X axis defined as the offset in the direction of the disk elongation from the galactic center and has the length of 370 pc. We selected an emission-free area with the same size of the red rectangle and made a calculation of the RMS noise level (1 1 K for its positionvelocity diagram. The lowest contour in Figure 1a corresponds 2.5 K. In Figure 2a the rotating disk component is seen as a main global structure in Vlsr 100 ­ 360 km s-1. On the other hand, the loop shows higher velocity of Vlsr 360 ­ 440 km s-1 and is clearly located out of range of the disk component. The loop shows large velocity width toward both its footpoints (OFFSET X  -20 and  -3 ) and exhibits a linear velocity increase

from OFFSET X = -18 to -3 . The brightness temperatures in the footpoints of the loop are twice (10 K) compared to the typical values of the bridge region of the loop ( 5 K). We also calculated the RMS noise level for Figure 2b and derived to be 1 K. The lowest contour in Figure 1b corresponds 2.5 (2.5 K ). We again confirmed the same velocity trend in the loop --the large velocity width toward the both footpoints and linear velocity gradient along the bridge-- in the narrow integration range, meaning the trend purely comes from the loop itself rather than an accidental superimpositions of other gas in the same line-of-sight.
We find a few compact clouds with a large velocity width (50 km s-1) toward OFFSET X = -19 , -16 , -3 indicated by the white arrows in Figure 1b. This may suggest that lots of compact, like 5 pc, and large-velocity-width clouds are embedded in the CMZ of NGC 253. Similar clouds are identified as High Velocity Compact Clouds (HVCCs; Oka et al. 1998) in the CMZ of the Milky Way, and this may be the key to understand gas dynamics of the CMZ. Sakamoto et al. (2011) suggested that the CMZs of the Galaxy and NGC 253 are resemble in terms of the spatial and velocity distributions of gas. It is interesting that even though the star formation activities in the CMZs are quite different between two galaxies, the similar HVCCs are discovered in both CMZs.
In order to clearly illustrate the peculiarity of the loop's position and velocity compared to the global rotating disk component, we corrected the position angle to 90 degree and subtracted the systemic velocity of 243 km s-1 (Koribalski et al. 2004) from the datasets. The new coordinates and velocity are described as offsets from the galactic center and systemic velocity, namely OFFSET X and OFFSET Y , and Vsub.
Figures 3a and 3b show integrated intensity distributions of the loop integrating over Vsub = 117 ­ 197 km s-1 (Vlsr = 360 ­ 440 km s-1) in 12CO(J=3­2) and 12CO(J=1­0), respectively. The loop is located -22 OFFSET X 0. 1, -2 OFFSET Y 3 . Although the eastern footpoint of the loop is located near the galactic center, the physical connection between these two is not seen, suggesting that the loop is not associated with the galactic center (See the panel at Vlsr = 350 km s-1 in Figure 1). The noise levels for 12CO(J=3­2) and 12CO(J=1­0) intensities are  13 K km s-1 and 7 K km s-1, respectively.
Figure 3a shows that the highest intensities above 1000 K km s-1 are seen at both footpoints of the loop. The sizes of the footpoints are 50 pc and 20 pc, respectively from east to west. Despite an order of magnitude coarser angular resolution, 12CO(J=1­0) emission also shows loop-like structure (Figure 3b) The lower integrated intensity toward the western footpoint in 12CO(J=1­0) are possibly originated from the beam dilution due to the poor angular resolution.
Figure 4 shows detailed velocity channel distribution for the loop integrating every 20 km s-1. The bottom rightmost panel is the same image as Figure 3a. In (-10 OFFSET X +3 , -5 OFFSET Y +2, +57 km s-1 Vsub +97 km s-1), CO emissions from the western footpoint of the loop and the disk component are contaminated. At Vsub = 117 km s-1 the bridge gas of the loop emerges and moves to the negative OFFSET X as the velocity increase until Vsub = 197 km s-1. The integrated intensity of the footpoints

of the loop shows 500 K km s-1 at most which corresponds to 2.5 times higher than the bridge region. On the other hand, there is no significant difference of intensities between the footpoint and bridge in Vsub = 157 ­ 197 km s-1. This suggests that the intensity of the western footpoint is not remarkably large but the line width is very large.
Figures 5a and 5b show intensity weighted mean velocity distribution (moment 1) and the square root of the intensity weighted velocity dispersion distribution (moment 2) of 12CO(J=3­2) emission in the velocity range of Vsub = 117 ­ 177 km s-1, respectively. Figure 5a again exhibits the velocity trend --linearly increase along with the bridge from east to west-- from Vsub = 130 km s-1 to 180 km s-1. Also, we find the velocity increase along with the width of the loop from the inner part to the outer part. The western footpoint shows slightly lower velocity of Vsub 150 km s-1 than the bridge because of its velocity extension to the lower velocity (see Figure 2).

Figure 5b suggests that the velocity dispersion of the loop does not have a significant variation and it is typically 10 ­ 20 km s-1. The small values toward the footpoints are caused by the velocity range of the moment maps, which focuses on the velocity of the bridge and only partly includes the footpoints.
3.2. 12CO(J=3­2)/12CO(J=1­0) ratios
Here we investigate excitation states in the giant molecular loop by using the line intensity ratio between 12CO(J=3­2) and 12CO(J=1­0). First we smoothed the 12CO(J=3­2) dataset to the beam size of 1. 6 × 1. 2 to match that of the 12CO(J=1­0) dataset and then regridded both the 12CO(J=1­0) and smoothed 12CO(J=3­2) datasets to 0. 3 and 5 km s-1. We next masked voxels under 10, which corresponds to 2 K km s-1 for 12CO(J=1­0) and 0.3 K km s-1 for 12CO(J=3­2). Finally we integrated these datasets every 20 km s-1 from Vsub = 117 to 197 km s-1 and made a ratio maps.
Figure 6 shows velocity channel distribution of the intensity ratio between 12CO(J=3­2) and 12CO(J=1­0) (hereafter R3-2/1-0) toward the molecular loop. The disk component indicated by the white box has the typical value of R3-2/1-0 of 0.61 and most pixels of the component display R3-2/1-0 under 0.8. On the other hand, the eastern and western footpoints of the loop has significantly higher values of 0.8 ­ 1.4 and 1.0 in the velocity

range of 117 ­ 177 km s-1 and 117 ­ 157 km s-1, respectively. The bridge region of the loop shows R3-2/1-0 of 0.4 to 1.1 in the velocity range of 137 ­ 157 km s-1 and there is significant difference of ratios between the inner part (0.8 to 1.4) and the outer part (0.4 to
0.8) of the bridge. The averaged value of R3-2/1-0 in the loop is 0.61. From these results we found that R3-2/1-0 is not so different between in the loop and disk component but the footpoints and inner part of the loop have significant higher values.

3.3. Mass of the molecular loop We here derive mass of the molecular loop from the integrated intensity of 12CO(J=1­0) emission. The following equation gives molecular column density NH2.

NH2 = XCOICO.

Here XCO and ICO are X factor, which is an empirical conversion factor to estimate NH2 and the integrated intensity of 12CO(J=1­0), respectively. We used the X factor of 0.5 ×
1020 [K km s-1 cm-2], which the value often used to the CMZ of NGC 253 (Leroy et al.

derived by

M = COLCO.

Here LCO is the luminosity of 12CO(J=1­0). The molecular mass derived from inside the red rectangle in Figure 3b is 1.42 × 107 M . We defined areas for the footpoints as the 12CO(J=3­2) intensity higher than 780 K km s-1, which correspond to white contours in Figure 5. The derived masses are 5.9 × 105 M , 1.7 × 105 M for the eastern and

western footpoints and the mass ratio between the loop's whole mass and the total mass of

the footpoints is 5%.
Next we derived NH2 from the higher-resolution 12CO(J=3­2) dataset by applying 12CO(J=3­2) /12CO(J=1­0) =0.61. Note that pixels with 10  (=130 K km s-1) in the

red rectangle of this dataset are also masked in advance. The derived maximum molecular column densities in the footpoints, disk component, and the bridge region are 9.1 × 1022 cm-2, 1.5 × 1023 cm-2, and 6.6 × 1022 cm-2, respectively. These physical parameters are

summarized in Table 1.

4. DISCUSSION
Stars and the interstellar medium are strongly concentrated within the central region of galaxies. This concentration makes the gravitational potential well deepest in a galaxy, attracting gas into the region (Morris & Serabyn 1996). This gas attraction leads to active

star formation which accelerates the gas motion by the stellar feedback (e.g., Bolatto et al. 2013). Such gas motion may also be accelerated via Parker instability (Parker 1966) as observationally confirmed by the magnetically floated loops. As such the gravitational potential well may be controlling gas motion via stellar feedback and Parker instability, and it is important to understand the origin of the gas kinematics in the galactic central region in our efforts to elucidate galactic evolution.
4.1. Origin of the non-circular motion
As shown in Section 3.1, in the present work we discovered loop-like gas distribution whose velocity is Vsub= 117 ­ 197 km s-1 from the CMZ of NGC 253. We interpret that the loop indicates a non-circular component whose velocity is deviated from the disk velocity by 50 km s-1. Krieger et al. (2019) identified "non-disk" component which does not follow the velocity field of the disk or bar (Krieger et al. 2019, ; Figure 6), which indicates the loop is a "non-disk" component. In the central region of the Milky Way, the origin of the gas with non-circular motion is usually interpreted in terms of the radial motion driven by the bar potential (e.g., Binney et al. 1991; Rodriguez-Fernandez et al. 2006). In the Milky Way, the bar is in the line of sight toward the plane and delineates a parallelogram within ± 250 km s-1 in the p-v diagram. NGC 253 is classified as SAB(s)c (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991) and the bar potential of NGC 253 is supposed to be weaker than in the Milky Way classified as SBc. However, the difference between the two bars are not well known quantitatively due to the limited sensitivity of near-infrared/optical observations in NGC 253. Future observations and simulations are desirable to clarify the issue. Here we assumed that the NGC 253 bar has a potential well comparable to that in the Milky Way, and the NGC 253 bar is accelerating the gas comparable to that in the Milky Way. Considering the angle between the line-of-sight and the bar major axis is 16, which is almost parallel, the bar acceleration reaches 250 km s-1 toward the bar direction in the Milky Way (Binney et al. 1991). The angle between the major axis and the NGC 253 bar is 17 (Scoville et al. 1985). i.e., the line of sight makes an angle of 73 to the bar and considering the inclination of 75 (Kuno et al. 2007), the projected velocity to the line of sight is estimated to be 250 km s-1 × cos(73) × sin(75) 71 km s-1 in the NGC 253, about 0.3 times of that of the Milky Way. It is therefore unlikely that the loop is accelerated by the bar. In addition, Krieger et al. (2019) argued that the "other-disk" in the "non-disk" needs to be explained

14

KONISHI ET AL.

by some additional kinematic component of the disk/ bar. The loop in NGC 253 is included in the "other-disk". We therefore consider that the non-circular motion should explored as a cause of the non-circular motion other than that driven by the bar potential.

4.2. Origin of the velocity distribution of the loop
As discussed in Section 4.1 the NGC 253 loop cannot be understood in terms of the bar potential, and some other driving mechanism is required. There have been claims that there is starburst and a number of high-mass stars are being formed in the CMZ of NGC 253 (e.g., Ando et al. 2017; Leroy et al. 2018). Observations indeed suggest that supershells driven by SN explosions (e.g., Sakamoto et al. 2006) and outflows by starburst (e.g., Bolatto et al. 2013). In the following we explore a possible role of supershell model as the origin of the loop.
4.2.1. Supershell model
In the model, the ambient gas is accelerated radially by the explosive winds and we expect an elliptical pattern of the accelerated gas in the p-v diagram. Figure 2a shows that the loop has a uniform velocity gradient as well as large velocity dispersion and high brightness in the loop footpoints. This is quite different from what is expected in a SNe accelerated shell. If we assume that the cavity in -16 OFFSET X -8 , Vlsr = 360 ­ 390 km s-1 was formed by a SNe we expect that there is a counter part of the shell at velocity less than Vlsr = 360 km s-1 (corresponding to Vsub = 97 km s-1). We however do not confirm the low velocity counterpart of the shell at velocity less than Vsub = 97 km s-1 (see Figure 8 in Appendix). It is possible that the cavity in the p-v diagram in Figure 2a is a feature formed by chance via overlapping of the loop and the part of disk component. Figure 7a shows an overlay of the loop with the 350 GHz continuum (Leroy et al. 2018), NH3 maser (Gorski et al. 2017), class I CH3OH maser (Gorski et al. 2017). This indicates that a combination of the loop and the part of the disk component looks like a shell forming cavity centered at OFFSET X = -9 , OFFSET Y = -2 . Accordingly, if we consider that the loop and the disk component form a shell, we expect that a cluster is located within the shell. Contrary to the expectation, the cluster is located at the footpoint of the loop and there is no cluster in the shell. This suggests that the cavity was not formed by the cluster. Figure 7b shows the loop and the disk component in a p-v diagram, indicating no cavity corresponding to the shell. We are thus forced to interpret that the shell is only a half in the north, where the other half disappeared by some unknown cause. If we assume the scenario, the expansion velocity of the shell is 80 km s-1 , and the kinetic energy of the shell becomes 8.8 × 1053 erg. Considering the total kinetic energy release of a SNe, the energy is too large to be supplied by a single SNe. If we assume that all the kinetic energy comes from SNe, 8800 SNe, or a cluster of 106-7 M , are required in total under an assumption of 10 % conversion efficiency. There is no observational sign of such a cluster in the cavity. The expansion velocity of a super shell is 20 km s-1 (Fukui et al. 1999; Matsunaga et al. 2001), much smaller than that observed in the present feature 80 km s-1 .

The above discussion suggests that the velocity and energetics of the present loop are difficult to understand in terms of SNe, and some other mechanism needs to be considered. As such mechanisms in the Milky Way we find two possibilities in the previous works; one is the intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) of 104-5 M (e.g., Oka et al. 2016) and the other magnetic flotation loop driven by the Parker instability (e.g., Fukui et al. 2006).
4.2.2. IMBH model
A IMBH attracts gravitationally the ambient gas, which circulates in the Kepler orbit around the IMBH and creates molecular gas having large velocity dispersion. Takekawa et al. (2019) proposed that the molecular gas around a IMBH having 105 M mass has mass of 104 M , with the radius of 5 pc, showing velocity width of 100 km s-1 . The present loop has total mass of 107 M , suggesting that it may include 1000 IMBHs with the mass of 105 M , whereas their total mass amounts of IMBHs to 108 M . We consider that the scenario is unlikely. It is unlikely that such spatial distribution takes place locally in the CMZ of NGC 253, and we do not consider the possibility in the following.
4.2.3. MHD model
In the molecular gas which is in dynamical equilibrium, the gravitational force is in equilibrium with the magnetic pressure. This configuration is however unstable and the magnetic field tends to rise up against the gravity once the equilibrium breaks down locally to form loop-like gas distribution. This rising motion is time dependent and is known as the Parker instability (Parker 1966). On the solar surface the instability has been observed over several decades. In the interstellar space, at a typical size of 10 ­ 100 pc the Parker instability was discovered in the central region of the Milky Way as the loops 1 and 2 by Fukui et al. (2006). Matsumoto et al. (1988) carried out two dimensional MHD numerical simulations of the galactic disk and showed that the magnetic loop grows and the gas falls down along the loop supersonically to create shocked region. Machida et al. (2009) extended the simulations to a global 3D configuration and showed that more than 400 loops are formed in a 1 kpc disk. Suzuki et al. (2015) developed refined 3D simulations and demonstrated the parallelogram pattern in the p-v diagram is reproduced only by the MHD effect without bar potential. These theoretical works lend support for the idea that MHD effect provides strong mechanism of agitating gas in the magnetized gas disk. NGC 253 is a place where the picture is applicable along with the CMZ.

4.3. Magnetic loop scenario In the above, Section 4.2.3, we recognized that the loop in NGC 253 has a shape similar to a magnetically floated loop as theoretically predicted. We will test if this is a viable mechanism in NGC 253 and explore its implications.
4.3.1. Plausibility of the magnetic loop
In the formation of a magnetically floated loop, the strong magnetic field which is energetic enough for the floatation in the vertical direction to the disk is required. We estimate

16

KONISHI ET AL.

the field strength required for the NGC 253 loop. By assuming that the kinetic energy of
the molecular gas is equal to the magnetic field energy, the following relation is used where  [kg m-3] is gas density, V [m s-1] the turbulence velocity, B [T] magnetic field strength, and µ0 = 4×10-7 N A-2 the vacuum magnetic permeability,

1 V 2 2

=

B2 2µ0

(3)

Assuming the shape of the NGC 253 loop as a cylinder which bases are corresponding

to the eastern and western footpoints, we estimate the gas density of the NGC 253 loop of n = 320 cm-3 adopting the gas mass of 1.4 × 107, the loop width of 50 pc and the loop

length of 300 pc. The density is combined with the average velocity dispersion over the loop as V = 43 km s-1 and the field strength of 0.5 mG for producing the NGC 253 loop.

This is a factor of three times larger than that required for loops 1 ­ 3 in the Milky Way. If

we adopt field strength of 1 ­ 10 mG as found in the Milky Way (e.g., Morris & Serabyn

1996), the present scenario seems to be reasonable in NGC 253. The loop height in NGC

253 is 20 pc, while the typical loop height in the Milky Way is 100 pc (Fukui et al. 2006).

The loop 1 ­ 3 are located at distance of 500 ­ 1000 pc from the Galactic center where

the gravitational field is weaker than the inner part within 100 ­ 300 pc. We infer that the

stronger gravitational force leads to the reduced scale height in the NGC 253 loop.

4.3.2. Comparison with magnetic loops in the Milky Way I: Physical properties of the magnetic
loops
We shall compare the physical parameters of the NGC 253 loop (hereafter N253-loop1) with those in the Milky Way loops. In the Milky Way, there are five loops/loop candidates in the previous papers; (loop 1, 2, Bania's clump 2, l=5.5 complex; Fukui et al. 2006), (loop3; Fujishita et al. 2009), (Sgr A, B2; Enokiya et al. 2021). Among them, loops 1 ­ 3 are established cases. Loops 1 and 2 having negative velocities are located at 500 pc from the Galactic center, and are connected at their footpoints. Loop 3 is also located at 500 pc from the Galactic center and has positive velocity. Table 1 lists the physical parameters of the four loops in the Milky Way along with the present N253-loop1.

4.3.3. Comparison with magnetic loops in the Milky Way II: The spatial distribution
N253-loop1 is separated from the galactic center by 200 pc, which is closer than loop 1 ­ 3 at a distance of 500 pc from the center of the Milky Way. N253-loop1 has length of 300 pc with 50 pc width, while loops 1 ­ 3 have length of 300 ­ 600 pc with 30 pc width. The cause of the larger width may be due to that N253-loop1 has multiple loops in it. Machida et al. (2009) showed that there is a trend that multiple loops tend to be collected as a single loop, lending support for the possibility. It may also be possible that the multiple loops explain the velocity variation vertical to the loop in N253-loop1 in Section 3.1.
The height of the loops is different between NGC 253 and the Milky Way. The height of N253-loop1 is 20 pc, an order of magnitude smaller than that of loop 1 ­ 3 200 pc. The low height is connected with the gravity toward the plane, which decreases with radius

from the galactic center (e.g., Morris & Serabyn 1996). If we assume that the scale height is lowest at the center in the same manner with the Milky Way, the N253-loop1 may be too close to the galactic center, where its height is kept low. If we assume that the Alfven speed to be 24 km s-1 (Fukui et al. 2006), the time scale of N253-loop1 is estimated to be 1 Myr because a loop grows at the Alfven speed (Matsumoto et al. 1988). This suggests that N253-loop1 is several times younger than loop 1 ­ 3. The CO intensity is higher in the footpoint than in the bridge. The intensity ratio between the footpoint and the bridge in loop 1 ­ 3 is 24:1 in 12CO(J=1­0), while that in NGC 253 is 1.4:1, suggesting that NGC 253 loop has a higher gas fraction in the bridge than in the footpoint as compared with loop 1 ­ 3. This is consistent with the time scale difference which may represent the younger age of N253-loop1. By the magnetic floatation, the gas coupled with the field lines is lifted up away from the disk and the gas falls down along the field lines to the footpoint. This suggests that the younger loop tends to have more gas in the bridge than in the footpoint. The maximum molecular column density of the footpoint of N253-loop1 is 1023 cm-2. The maximum column density of the footpoint in loop 1 ­ 3 is 1022 cm-2 (Enokiya et al. 2021), ten times less than in N253-loop1. The total gas mass in N253-loop1 is 107 M , 100 times more than in loop 1-2 and ten times more than in loop 3. The cause of the larger mass in N253-loop1 than in loop 1 ­ 3 may be ascribed to the large ambient gas density in the CMZ of NGC 253. The loop 1 ­ 3 region has gas column density of 1022cm-2

18

(Enokiya et al. 2021), while that in CMZ of NGC 253 is 50 times larger, i.e. 5 × 1023 cm-2 (Sakamoto et al. 2011).
4.3.4. Comparison with magnetic loops in the Milky Way III: The velocity distribution
Next, we compare the velocity distribution among the relevant features. N253-loop1 has velocity width of 50 ­ 100 km s-1 in the footpoints with a velocity gradient of 40 km s-1 vertical to the loop. The linewidth of loop 1 ­ 3 is 50 km s-1 (Fukui et al. 2006; Fujishita et al. 2009; Torii et al. 2010), having uniform velocity gradients of 40 km s-1 to 100 km s-1. This suggests that the velocity distribution of N253-loop1 looks similar to loop 1 ­ 3.

4.3.5. Comparison with magnetic loops in the Milky Way IV: The spatial distribution of gas
excitation
Then we test the excitation states of gas. The R3-2/1-0 in N253-loop1 is 0.8 ­ 1.4 at 30 pc resolution in the footpoint and bridge, higher than 0.6 in the footpoint and bridge in the inner part of the disk component. This indicates that some extra excitation mechanism, not working in the disk, is needed in the loop disk component. A comparison with loop 1, 2 suggests that in loop 1 the R3-2/1-0 tends to be enhanced in the footpoint and the inner part at 5 pc resolution (Kudo et al. 2011), looking similar to N253-loop1. This suggests that the enhanced excitation condition of N253-loop1 may be ascribed to the magnetic flotation.
4.3.6. New insights of magnetic loop
In Section 4.3.2 ­ 4.3.5, it was shown that the N253-loop1 has properties different from those of loop 1 ­ 3. First, because the CMZ of NGC 253 is more massive than the central region of the Milky Way, the gas mass of N253-loop1 is 10 ­ 100 times more massive than in loop 1 ­ 3. Further, loop 1 ­ 3 has more mass than the bridge and N253-loop1 has a short timescale of 1 Myr. It was then suggested that N253-loop1 is in a younger evolutionary stage than loop 1 ­ 3. There are young rich stellar clusters in the footpoint of N253-loop1 (Gorski et al. 2017; Leroy et al. 2018). Interestingly, N253-loop1 has a similar age to the cluster 1 Myr (Leroy et al. 2018), suggesting that the loop might be connected to the formation of the cluster.
Enokiya et al. (2021) suggested that the falling gas along the field lines in the CMZ of the Milky Way collided with the gas in the footpoint and compressed gas to formed the cluster in 0.5 Myr. These authors argued that the molecular stream connecting the active star forming regions Sgr A and Sgr B2 show a loop like distribution with a 20 pc height, which may indicate magnetic flotation (Enokiya et al. 2021, accepted).
N253-loop1 shows similar spatial and kinematic signatures to the Milky Way loops. We therefore suggest that the ongoing starburst in the CMZ of NGC 253 is possibly being driven by multiple magnetic loops at their compressed footpoints. This possibility deserves further pursuits. In the past, the shell like distributions and the non-rotating gas components in NGC 253 are produced by the stellar feedback (e.g., Sakamoto et al. 2006; Bolatto et al. 2013; Krieger et al. 2019). The present work invokes a new alternative as

ALMA OBSERVATIONS OF THE CENTRAL REGION OF NGC 253

19

the origin of the gas distribution. Krieger et al. (2019) showed that there are several more non-rotating components in the CMZ of NGC 253. A detailed study of the features may deserve a detailed analysis similar to the present work. Such a study (e.g., R. Konishi et al. 2021b in prep., R. Enokiya et al. 2021c in prep.) may lead to recognition of more loop candidates, or signatures of a bar potential or IMBH, allowing us to obtain a deeper insight into the CMZs in general.

5. CONCLUSIONS
We analyzed kinematics of molecular gas in the central molecular zone of NGC 253 by using a high-resolution ALMA dataset with the angular resolution of 0. 18 (3 pc) in 12CO(J=3­2), and derived molecular mass from a 12CO(J=1­0) dataset with the angular resolution of 1. 6 (30 pc). The conclusions are summarized as follows.
1. We found a loop-like molecular structure exhibiting a non-circular motion toward the southwest of the galactic center of NGC 253. The length, width, and height of the loop are 300, 50, 20 pc, respectively. We derived molecular mass and maximum column densities at the footpoints/bridge --those are 107 M , 1 × 1023 cm-2, and 6.6 × 1022 cm-2, respectively-- from the CO datasets.
2. The footpoints of the loop show very large velocity dispersion of 50 ­ 100 km s-1 and the bridge region has the velocity gradient, which increases east to west along the loop. The CO intensity ratios (R3-2/1-0) are significantly higher toward the inner part and footpoints of the loop.
3. It seems to be difficult to accelerate the velocity of the giant molecular loop up to 200 km s-1 by a bar potential model. A supershell model is also difficult because of its shortage of energy and the difference of the velocity structure. A magnetic flotation model driven by Parker instability is the only mechanism which can be responsible for the loop's huge energy and peculiar kinematics.
4. We compared the N253-loop1 with the magnetic loops in the MilkyWay (loop 1 ­ 3), and found that the timescale of the N253-loop1 is a few times shorter than the loops 1 ­ 3. The N253-loop1's large mass ratio between its bridge and footpoints implies that the loop is on the younger stage than that of the loops 1 ­ 3.
We found that super star clusters having ages similar to the loop are located in the vicinity of the footpoints of the N253-loop1. This may be triggered by cloud-cloud collisions caused by downflows along the loop and this mechanism possibly triggered the starburst in the CMZ of the galaxy (Enokiya et al. 2021).
