XIAOYING DAI, YAN PAN, BIN YANG , AND AIHUI ZHOU
Abstract. In this paper, we study an adaptive planewave method for multiple eigenvalues of second-order elliptic partial equations. Inspired by the technique for the adaptive finite element analysis, we prove that the adaptive planewave method has the linear convergence rate and optimal complexity.
Key words. adaptive planewave, multiple eigenvalues, convergence rate, optimal complexity
1. Introduction. Adaptive methods are widely used to solve the partial differential equations, and their mathematical foundation has derived much attention.
We understand that eigenvalue problems play an important role in science and engineering. For instance, the Kohn-Sham equation is used to model ground state electronic structures of molecular systems in quantum chemistry and materials science (see, e.g., [3, 8, 15]). And the central computation in solving the Kon-Sham equation is the repeated solution of linear Schr¨odinger-type equations.
We see that adaptive finite element methods for linear eigenvalue problems as well as nonlinear eigenvalue problems such as Kohn-Sham equations have been extensively investigated (see, e.g., [5, 7, 10, 11, 13] and references cited therein). Note that the planewave discretization methods have been widely used in physics and chemistry [15] and there are only a handful of works on the design and analysis of the adaptive planewave method (see [9, 12, 14]).
In this paper, to fill in this gap, we design and analyze an adaptive planewave method for a class of second-order elliptic eigenvalue problems. Following the analysis technique of the adaptive finite element analysis in [10, 11], we prove that the adaptive planewave method has linear convergence rate and optimal complexity under some certain reasonable assumptions. More precisely, we have:
· Under the assumption that M0  1, the planewave approximation Mn () will converge to the exact eigenspace M () with some convergence rate, as shown as follows (see Theorem 4.17):
dHp1()(M (), Mn ()) n,
where   (0, 1) is some constant. · Under the assumption that M0  1, M ()  As, and the marked indexes
with minimal cardinality, the Fourier-Galetkin approximations have a optimal complexity as follows (see Theorem 4.24):
dHp1()(M (), Mn ()) (|n| - |0|)-s.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we describe some basic notation and introduce the linear eigenvalue problem. In section 3, we review the results of planewave approximations for a class of linear second-order elliptic source problem, which will be useful in our analysis. In section 4, we construct a posteriori error estimators from the relationship between the elliptic eigenvalue approximation with the associated source problems. Next, we design an adaptive planewave method for elliptic eigenvalue problem. Finally, we analyze the asymptotic contraction property and optimal complexity.
2. Preliminaries. Let  = [0, 2)d(d  1). Denote the family of periodic continuous functions by

Cp0() = {v  C0(Rd) : v(x + 2nej) = v(x), 1  j  d, n  Z, x  },
where ej is a n-vector whose jth entry is 1 and 0 elsewhere. For any k  Zd, we denote k(x) = 1/(2)d/2eik·x, x  Rd. It is clear that the family {k}kZd forms an orthonormal basis of

L2p() = {v  L2loc(Rd) : v(x + 2nej) = v(x), 1  j  d, n  Z, x  },

and for any v  L2p(),

v=

v^k k

kZd

with

v^k

=

(v, k)

=

v(x)e-ik·x dx.


Note that

v

=

|v^|2. We shall use the notation of Sobolev spaces Hps() of

kZd

real valued periodic functions for s  R









Hps() = u(x) =

u^keik·x :

(1 + |k|2)s|u^|2 <  and k, u^-k = u^k

(u, v)Hps() =

kZd

Here and hereafter, |k| denotes the Euclidean norm of the multi-index k. Throughout
this paper, we will omit domain  when we express norm and inner product. Given any finite index set   Zd, we define the subspace of Hp1()

V := span{k : k  }.

We set || = the cardinality of . Specially, we denote M for any positive integer M by

M = {k  Zd : |k|  M }. We shall also define the L2-projection  : L2p()  V by
(u - u, v) = 0, v  V.

2.1. A linear eigenvalue problem. We consider the following elliptic eigenvalue problem:

(2.1)

Lu = u in , u(x + 2ej) = u(x) 1  j  d,

where L is a linear second order elliptic operator:

Lu = -u + V u.

Here we assume V  Hp(),  > d/2 and 0 <   V   < . Note that Hp()  Cp0().
The weak form of problem (2.1) as follows: find (, u)  R × Hp1() such that

(2.2)

a(u, v) = (u, v), v  Hp1(),

where

a(u, v) = (Lu, v) = (u, v) + (V u, v).

We shall define by satisfies

v a = a(v, v) the energy norm of any v  Hp1(), which

 

v

Hp1 

 v a   v Hp1 ,

where  = min(, 1),  = max(, 1). Remark 2.1. In fact, the assumption 0 <   V   <  is unnecessary,
which is just for convenience. Indeed, we see from Hp()  Cp0() that

a(v, v) 

v

2 Hp1

-

(1

L p ) v L2p

Thus, there exits µ > 0 such that

v  Hp1().

v

2 Hp1



aµ(v, v)

v  Hp1,

where

aµ(v, w) = a(v, w) + µ(v, w) v, w  Hp1().

Consequently, instead of (2.2), we turn to study

aµ(u, v) = E(u, v) v  Hp1()

with E =  + µ. We see that (2.2) has a sequence of real eigenvalues

1 < 2  3  · · · and the corresponding eigenfunctions

which can be assumed to satisfy

u1, u2, u3, . . . ,

(ui, uj) = ij, i, j = 1, 2, . . . ,
3

where the js is repeated according to geometric multiplicity. Given any finite index set   Zd, the Galerkin approximation of (2.2) is defined
as

(2.3)

u  V : a(u, v) = (u, v), v  V.

The eigenvalues of (2.3) may be ordered as follows:

1,  2,  · · ·  n,, n = dimV, and corresponding eigenfunctions may be denoted by

satisfying

u1,, u2,, . . . , un,,

(ui,, uj,) = ij, i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n.
3. Planewave approximation of a source problem. In this section, we consider the following source problem:

(3.1)

Lui = fi in , i = 1, . . . , N, ui(x + 2ej) = ui(x) 1  j  d.

Note that ui  Hp2() provided fi  L2() [4]. We obtain from variational principle that the weak form of problem (3.1) reads
as follows: find U  (u1, . . . , uN )  (Hp1())N such that

(3.2)

a(ui, vi) = (fi, vi) vi  Hp1(), i = 1, . . . , N,

For U = (u1, . . . , uN )  (Hp1())N , we shall denote

U a=

N

1/2

u

i=1

U Hp1 =

i=1

Define operator K : L2p()  Hp1() as follows:

(3.3)

a(Kw, v) = (w, v), w  L2p(), v  Hp1().

We see that K is well-defined and compact. Define Galerkin-projection P : Hp1()  V by

(3.4)

a(u - Pu, v) = 0, v  V.

If we define the operator K : L2p()  V as follows

a(Kw, v) = (w, v), w  L2p(), v  V,

then K = PK. We shall also use the following notation:

() =

sup

f L2(), f

inf
L2 =1 vV

Kf - v a.

We have also the following conclusion, which can be obtained by a standard argument and be referred to [2, 17].

u - Pu L2p  () u - Pu a, u  Hp1().

Given finite index set   Zd, the planewave approximation of (3.2) is defined as follows: find U = (u1,, . . . , uN,)  (V)N such that

(3.5)

a(ui,, vi,) = (fi, vi,), vi,  V, i = 1, . . . , N.

For any wi,  V(i = 1, 2, . . . , N ), we define the residual

r(wi,) = fi - Lwi,.

The following proposition can be found in [9].
Proposition 3.4. Let ui(i = 1, 2, . . . , N ) are the solution of problem (3.2). Then for any ui,  V(i = 1, 2, . . . , N ), we have

3.1. Adaptive planewave algorithm. In this section, we consider the adaptive planewave algorithm for solving the linear eigenvalue problem (2.2).
We recall the residual error estimates of the planewave approximations and the convergence of the corresponding adaptive method. The posterior error estimator (vi,) for any vi,  V in [9] is defined by

2(vi,; ) =

and

are

coefficients

of

r(vi, ).

We shall use (vi,) short for (vi,; Zd).

For any U = (u1,, . . . , uN,)  (V)N , we set

N
2(U; ) = 2(ui,; ).
i=1

Similarly, 2(U) is short for 2(U; Zd). Proposition 3.4 indicates the following proposition directly.

The adaptive Fourier-Glerkin algorithm for solving (3.2) can be stated as follows [9]:

Algorithm 1 Adaptive planewave method
1. Choose parameters   (0, 1) and tol  [0, 1).
2. Set r(ui,0 ) = fi, i = 1, 2, . . . , N , 0 = , k = 0. 3. Compute error estimator (Uk ). 4. If (Uk ) < tol, then stop. 5. Construct k by the D¨orfler marking strategy with parameter . 6. Let k+1 = k  k. 7. Solve (3.2) relative to index set k+1 to get solution Uk+1 =
(u1,k+1 , . . . , uN,k+1 )  (Vk+1 )N . 8. Let k = k + 1 and go to 3.

The D¨orfler marking strategy in Algorithm 1 can be stated as follows:
Algorithm 2 D¨orfler marking strategy 1. Given parameter   (0, 1). 2. Construct a subset   c := Zd \  of minimal cardinality satisfying
(U; )  (U),

We observe that (U) is a summation with infinite term because of k  Zd. Thus this is an ideal algorithm and may not be applicable.

We then have the following result, which is an extension of [9] from N = 1 to any

N.

4. Adaptive planewave analysis of a linear eigenvalue problem.

4.1. A posteriori error estimators. For a cluster of eigenvalues k1+1  · · ·  k0+N of (2.2), we assume that multiple eigenvalues are not split, namely,

k0 < k0+1  · · ·  k0+N < k0+N+1.

Here, k0 can be taken as 0, which means that we just consider the first eigenvalue. If

not accounting the multiplicity, we assume the N eigenvalues k0+1, . . . , k0+N belong

to m eigenvalues (1) < (2) < . . . < (m) with the multiplicity of each eigenvalues

being qi, that is, N =

m i=1

qi.

We set

M ((i)) = {w  Hp1() : w is an eigenfunction of (2.2) corresponding to i}.

Let , be the (k1 + )th eigenvalue of problem (2.3) and u, be the eigenfunction corresponding to ,( = 1, . . . , N ), respectively. Set

M((i)) = span{u,ki+1, u,ki+2 . . . , u,ki+qi },

where ki =

i-1 j=1

qi.

Let i be a circle in the complex plane centered at µ(i) = -(i)1 and not enclosing

any other eigenvalues of K. Define the spectral projection associated with K and (i)

by

Ei

=

E ((i) )

=

1 2i

(z - K)-1dz.
i

Note that, except µ,ki+1 = -,1ki+1, µ,ki+2 = -,1ki+2, . . . , µ,ki+q = -,1ki+q, there is no other eigenvalue of Kh contained in i when  is sufficiently large. Thus, we can define the spectral projection associated with K and ,ki+1, ,ki+2, . . . , ,ki+q as

E,i

and consider the following operator:

For any u  M ((i)) with u L2 = 1, we see from E,iu  M((i)) that there exist some constants {,i,(u)}q=i 1 such that

Define the residual r(u,) by

and the residual r(E,iu) by

r(E,iu) = ,i,(u),ki+u,ki+ + E,iu - V E,iu.

Then, for any u, define the error estimator (u; ) by

Similar to Lemma 3.2, we obtain
Lemma 4.1. Let

Then M ()  0 as M  . Proof. For any w  M () with w L2 = 1, we have

We see from u = Ku that u  Hp2(). Hence Proposition 3.1 implies

which completes the proof. We note that ()  () if   . Since results in [1] hold for finite-dimensional discretizations, we have the following
propositions. Proposition 4.2. Let   R be any eigenvalue of (2.2) with multiplicity q and
,( = 1, 2, . . . , q) be the eigenvalues of (2.3) corresponding to . Then

(4.1) u - Eu L2 () u - Eu a,

u - Eu a () u  M ().

f Hp1(), f a=1 vV

Similar to Lemma 3.2, we have

Proposition 4.4. (M )  0 as M  .

Proof. For any f  Hp1() with f a = 1, we have

inf

Kf - v a 

Kf - M Kf a.

Set w = Kf , we get

Kf - v a 

w - M w a.

Thanks to w  Hp2() and Lemma 3.1, we obtain

w - M w Hp1 

 M

w Hp2 .

Since K : Hp1()  Hp2() is bounded, we get the conclusion. The following results can be founded in [10].
Proposition 4.5. For any u  M () with u L2 = 1, there holds

where C is some constant not depending on . Proposition 4.6. For any ui, uj  M () with (ui, uj) = ij (i, j = 1, 2, . . . , q),
there holds

(Eui, Euj) = ij + O(()()).

For two subspaces X and Y of Hp1(), define

dHp1 () (X,

Y

)

:=

sup
uX, u L2 =1

inf
vY

u - v a.

Remark 4.1. We see that dHp1 ()(X, Y ) = 0 implies X  Y¯ . Here Y¯ is the closure of Y . In particular, if dim X = dim Y < , dHp1 ()(X, Y ) = 0 implies X =Y.
Note that (2.2) and (2.3) can be rewritten as

u = Ku, u = PKu,

where K and P are the operators defined by (3.3) and (3.4), respectively. For any u  M ((i)), define ,i = a(E,iu, E,iu)/(E,iu, E,iu), then we have

then

Now, we first analyze the relationship between the approximation of the linear eigenvalue problem and that of the associated source problem.
Similar to the proof of Theorem 3.1 of [10], we have Theorem 4.7. Let r := () + (), then we have

(4.7)

u - Eu a = w - Pw a + O(r) u - Eu a,

for any u  M () with u L2 = 1. Remark 4.2. Note that

(4.8)

u - w a  C~r u - Eu a,

which will be used in our latter analysis.
Remark 4.3. Lemma 3.2 and Lemma 4.1 imply that rM  0 as M  . We see from Theorem 4.7 that up to a high order term, the error of the linear eigenvalue problem is equivalent to that of the source problem with

qi
,i, (u),ki + u,ki +
=1

as the source term. Theorem 4.8. Let   M0 . There exist constants C1, C2, which only depend
on coercivity constant  and continuity constant , such that

C1(E,iu)  u - E,iu a  C2(E,iu) u  M ((i)), i = 1, 2, . . . , m

provided M0  1.

Proof. Note that Lw,i =

which together with identity

which indicates that r(E,iuki+) is a linear combination of r(u,ki+1), . . . , r(u,ki+q). We define the following matrices

V~i := [v~ki+,k], Vi := [vki+j,k]T , Mi := [Mki+,ki+j ], i = 1, 2, . . . , m,
where v~ki+,k = r^k(E,iuki+), vki+j,k = r^k(u,ki+j ), and Mki+,ki+j = (E,iuki+, u,ki+j ),  = 1, . . . , qi, j = 1, . . . , qi. Thus (4.10) can be written as
V~i = MiVi, i = 1, 2, . . . , m.
Denote V~i,k by [v~ki+1,k, . . . , v~ki+qi,k]T and Vi,k by [vki+1,k, . . . , vki+qi,k]T . Then for any k  , we have

cluster of eigenvalues of (2.2), which belong to m eigenvalues (1) < (2) < · · · < (m)

if not accounting the multiplicity, with the multiplicity of each eigenvalue being qi and

the corresponding eigenspace M ((i)). Assume N =

m i=1

If

M

the

planewave

approximation of M , then,

m

d2Hp1()(M , M) =

d2Hp1()(M ((i)), M((i))).

Proof. Let {uki+1, . . . , uki+qi } be an orthonormal basis of M ((i)) and set Ui = (uki+1, . . . , uki+qi ). On the one hand,

From Theorem 4.8, we have that

(E,iUi)

provided M0  1. Consequently,

(U) dHp1()(M , M) (U).

4.2. Adaptive algorithm. In the above discussion, we have defined a posteriori error estimators. We now design an adaptive planewave method for solving (2.2) as follows:
Algorithm 3 Adaptive planewave method for eigenvalue problem 1. Choose parameters   (0, 1), tol  [0, 1) and M0  N. 2. Let the initial space be 0 = M0 and k = 0. 3. Solve (2.3) relative to the index set k to get solution (k,, uk,)( = 1, . . . , N ). 4. Compute error estimator (Uk ). 5. If (Uk ) < tol, then stop. 6. Construct k by the D¨orfler marking strategy with parameter . 7. Set k+1 = k  k. 8. Let k = k + 1 and go to 3.
13

The D¨orfler marking strategy is stated as follows, which is similar to that of source problems, only with different error estimators.
Algorithm 4 D¨orfler marking strategy 1. Given a parameter   (0, 1). 2. Construct a subset   c = Zd \  of minimal cardinality satisfying
(U; )  (U).

We observe that (U) is a summation with infinite term because of k  Zd. Thus this is an ideal algorithm. Consequently, we need to introduce a new estimator so that the adaptive algorithm can be applicable. For an given   (0, 1), we choose the approximation r~(U) of r(U) with finite Fourier expansions such that

(4.11)

r~(U) - r(U) Hp-1   r~(U) . Hp-1

Therefore we easily get the following inequalities:

(1 - ) r~(U) Hp-1  r(U) Hp-1  (1 + ) r~(U) . Hp-1 Then we define a new error estimator as

~(U) = r~(U) , Hp-1

which is computable. Lemma 4.11. Let M1 and M2 be positive integers. Then

Now we give the following feasible adaptive planewave method.

Algorithm 5 Feasible Adaptive planewave method for eigenvalue problem 1. Choose parameters ~  (0, 1), tol  [0, 1),   (0, ~) and M0  N. 2. Let the initial space be 0 = M0 and k = 0. 3. Solve (2.3) relative to the index set k to get solution (k,, uk,)( = 1, . . . , N ). 4. Choose the approximation r~(U) of r(U) such that
r~(U) - r(U) Hp-1   r~(U) . Hp-1
5. Compute error estimator ~(Uk ). 6. If ~(Uk ) < tol/(1 + ), then stop. 7. Construct k by the Feasible D¨orfler marking strategy with parameter . 8. Set k+1 = k  k. 9. Let k = k + 1 and go to 3.

The Feasible D¨orfler marking strategy is stated as follows, which is similar to that of source problems, only with a different error estimator.
Algorithm 6 Feasible D¨orfler marking strategy 1. Given a parameter ~  (0, 1). 2. Construct a subset   c = Zd \  of minimal cardinality satisfying
~(U; )  ~~(U).

The following lemma is an extension of [9] from N = 1 to any N . Lemma 4.12. Let , ~  (0, 1) and  be a finite index set containing . If

On the other hand, if

4.3. Convergence. Before analyzing the convergence of adaptive planewave

eigenvalue computations, we shall establish some relations between two level planewave

(4.14)

U - En+1 U a = W n - Pn+1 W n a + O(rn )( U - En+1 U a + U - En U a).

Proof. For getting (4.14), it is sufficient to prove that, for any u  M ((i)) with u L2 = 1, if

qi

wn,i =

n,i,(u)n,ki+K un,ki+,

=1

16

then the following equality holds:

u - En+1,iu a = wn,i - Pn+1 wn,i a + O(rn )( u - En+1,iu a + u - En,iu a).

Let

qi

wn+1,i =

n+1,i,(u)n+1,ki+K un+1,ki+.

It is clear that

Pn+1 (wn ,i - wn+1,i) + u - wn,i a

wn,i - wn+1,i a + u - wn,i a u - wn+1,i a + u - wn,i a,

which together with (4.8) leads to

Pn+1 (wn,i - wn+1,i) + u - wn,i a

rn+1 u - En+1,iu a + rn u - En,iu a rn ( u - En+1,iu a + u - En,iu a).

Note that (4.6) implies

u - En+1,iu = u - wn,i + Pn+1 (wn,i - wn+1,i) + wn,i - Pn+1 wn,i;

we get

u - En+1,iu a = wn,i - Pn+1 wn,i a + O(rn )( u - En+1,iu a + u - En,iu a).

Now, we can give the error reduction.

Theorem 4.16. Let k0+1  k0+2  · · ·  k0+N be a cluster of eigenvalues of (2.2), which belong to m eigenvalues (1) < (2) < · · · < (m) if not accounting the

Then there exists a constant   (0, 1), depending only on , , and parameter 

used by Algorithm 5, such that, for any two iterations n and n + 1,

(4.15)

provided M0  1.
Proof. It follows from Lemma 4.12 and Lemma 4.13 that there exists a constant   (0, 1) such that

D¨orfler marking strategy is satisfied with  = . So, we conclude from (3.7) and the

fact Pn W n = En U that there exists a constant   (0, 1) such that

(4.16)

4.4. Complexity. Similarly, following the complexity analysis in [10, 11], we are able to analyze the complexity of the adaptive planewave method for eigenvalue problems via the complexity results for source problems. We first review some complexity results for the associated source problem (3.2).
For source problems (3.2), we have the following localized upper bound estimate and D¨orfler the property, which is an extension of [9] from N = 1 to any N .
Proposition 4.18. Suppose     Zd be nonempty index sets. Let U and U be discrete solutions of (3.2) relative to index set  and , respectively. Then the following localized upper bound is valid

U - U

where µ  (0, 1), then  satisfies D¨orfler condition, i.e.,

Next, we introduce a function approximation class as follows

As := {v  Hp1() : |v|s < },

where

|v|s = sup 

inf

(|| - |0|)s,

>0 {:0,infvV v-v a}

We see that As is the class of functions which can be approximated within a given

tolerance  by trigonometric polynomials related to a index set  with number of degrees of freedom || - |0|  -1/s|v|1s/s.
To give the complexity of Algorithm 5, we do some preparations.

Lemma 4.20. Let k0+1  k0+2  · · ·  k0+N be a cluster of eigenvalues of

(2.2), which belong to m eigenvalues (1) < (2) < · · · < (m) if not accounting the

We are now ready to show that Algorithm 5 possesses optimal complexity.

Theorem 4.23. Let k0+1  k0+2  · · ·  k0+N be a cluster of eigenvalues of

(2.2), which belong to m eigenvalues (1) < (2) < · · · < (m) if not accounting the

multiplicity, with the multiplicity of each eigenvalue being qi and the corresponding

eigenspace M ((i))  As for some s. Assume N =

Let {uki+}q=i 1

Set Mn ((i)) =

span{un,ki+1, . . . , un,ki+qi }. Then the nth iteration solution space Mn satisfies

(4.24)

U - En U a (|n| - |0|)-s,

(4.25)

n,ki+ - (i) (|n| - |0|)-2s,

provided M0  1. Proof. From Theorem 4.16, we see that

the last inequality holds because of  < 1. This give the (4.24). On the other hand,

combining (4.3), the definition of () with (4.24), we get (4.25).

Similar to Thorem 4.17, we may obtain from Theorem 4.23 that

Theorem 4.24. Let k0+1  k0+2  · · ·  k0+N be a cluster of eigenvalues of

(2.2), which belong to m eigenvalues (1) < (2) < · · · < (m) if not accounting the

5. Concluding Remarks. In this paper, we have designed and analyzed an adaptive planewave method for a class of second-order elliptic eigenvalue problems. Following [10, 11], we use the relationship between elliptic eigenvalue approximations with corresponding source problems to carry out the analysis of the convergence rate and the complexity of the adaptive planewave method. We have proved that the adaptive planewave method has the asymptotic contraction property and optimal complexity.
