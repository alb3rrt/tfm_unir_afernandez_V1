ABSTRACT
We calculate Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) of Mo and Ru by taking into account the contribution from p-process nucleosynthesis. We estimate yields of p-nuclei such as 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru through the p-process in various supernova (SN) progenitors based upon recent models. In particular, the p-process in energetic hypernovae produces a large amount of p-nuclei compared to the yield in ordinary core-collapse SNe. Because of this the abundances of 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru in the Galaxy are significantly enhanced at [Fe/H]=0 by the p-process. We find that the p-process in hypernovae is the main contributor to the elemental abundance of 92Mo at low metallicity [Fe/H] < -2. Our theoretical prediction of the elemental abundances in metal-poor stars becomes more consistent with observational data when the p-process in hypernovae is taken into account.

1. INTRODUCTION
The p-nuclei are stable nuclides with atomic numbers Z  34 that are located on the protonrich side of the -stability line (Burbidge et al. 1957). The isotopic fractions of the p-nuclei are typically lower than 1.5%. Such p-nuclei are not synthesized through the rapid or slow neutron capture processes (r- and s-processes) that predominantly contribute to production of heavy nuclei. It was suggested that the p-nuclei may be produced by (p, ) or (, p) reactions (Burbidge et al.

2
1957). Woosley & Howard (1978) and Hayakawa et al. (2004) have provided evidence confirming that most p-nuclei are synthesized by successive photodisintegration reactions from heavier isotopes in high temperature environments (-process).
Candidates for the -process astrophysical site include the O-Ne rich layers in core-collapse supernovae (SNe II) (Woosley & Howard 1978; Rayet et al. 1990; Prantzos et al. 1990; Rayet et al. 1995; Hayakawa et al. 2008) and the outermost layers of an exploding carbon-oxygen white dwarf (SNe Ia) (Howard et al. 1991; Goriely et al. 2002; Kusakabe et al. 2011; Travaglio et al. 2011).
Calculations of -process nucleosynthesis can produce the relative abundances of most p-nuclei except for 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru. The solar isotopic fractions of these four nuclei are 14.84, 9.25, 5.54, and 1.87%, respectively. These fractions are much higher than those of other p-nuclei. The relatively large isotopic fractions suggest that another major astrophysical process for the origin of these four nuclei. Howard et al. (1991) calculated the nucleosynthesis in SNe Ia to explain the abundances of the Mo and Ru isotopes by a combination of photodisintegration reactions and particle-induced reactions. However, the results of Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) simulations with SNe Ia (Travaglio et al. 2015) and SNe II (Travaglio et al. 2018) underproduce the solar abundances of the Mo and Ru p-isotopes.
Fr¨ohlich et al. (2006) proposed a new mechanism, p-process nucleosynthesis. This process occurs via free neutrons produced from the absorption of electron antineutrinos on free protons, p(¯e, e+)n, in the proton-rich neutrino-driven winds of SNe II. This enhances the abundances of 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru. Large amounts of p-nuclei can be produced through a series of (p, ) and (n, p) reactions in the p-process (Fro¨hlich et al. 2006; Pruet et al. 2006; Wanajo 2006). The uncertainties in the p-process such as the hydrodynamic state variables of neutrino-driven winds, neutrino fluxes, and nuclear reaction rates have been studied widely (Wanajo et al. 2011; Arcones et al. 2012; Fujibayashi et al. 2015; Sasaki et al. 2017; Bliss et al. 2018; Nishimura et al. 2019; Xiong et al. 2020; Jin et al. 2020). However, there has been little clear observational evidence, for example in solar abundances, stellar chemical composition, or isotopic anomalies in primitive meteorites, that these proposed processes actually occurred in the Galaxy.
Recently, however, it was reported that the abundance ratios observed in the Cassiopeia A SN remnant are results of the -rich freeze out and neutrino-processed proton rich ejecta (Sato et al. 2021). Furthermore, molybdenum isotopic anomalies in both differentiated (i.e. melted asteroids) and primitive meteorites (i.e. carbonaceous chondrites) have been reported (Dauphas et al. 2002;

3
Budde et al. 2016; Poole et al. 2017). In particular it was found that the enhanced isotopic anomalies of the p-isotopes 92,94Mo are correlated with that of the r-isotope 100Mo (Dauphas et al. 2002; Budde et al. 2016). However, isotopic abundances observed in iron meteorites (Poole et al. 2017) shows a different pattern. In this case, the anomaly of 92Mo only weakly correlates with that of 100Mo. These results indicate that the 92,94Mo may be synthesized in the same star producing 100Mo but by a different nucleosynthetic process.
The p-process in core-collapse SNe where the r-process also occurs is one of the candidate sites for production of 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru. The observational evidence that these four nuclei are predominately synthesized by the p-process may be found in metal-poor stars whose Mo and Ru elemental compositions have been reported.
For the present work we study the GCE of Mo and Ru. We first determine yield data of the pprocess in various SN models. A range of models is considered because these processes depend upon the hydrodynamic state variables of neutrino-driven winds in SNe II. In particular, we estimate yields of 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru in the p-process based upon simulation results of both SNe II and hypernovae (HNe) that are more energetic SN events ( 1052erg) (Galama et al. 1998; Iwamoto et al. 1998). We then apply the calculated yields of these four anomalous p-nuclei to GCE and analyze the various contributions from the p-process to their solar abundances. We show the yield of the p-process in hypernovae can explain the enhanced elemental abundances of Mo and Ru observed in metal-poor stars.
We note that a complementary study of the GCE for Mo and Ru (along with Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba) has recently been reported in Vincenzo et al. (2021). In that work it was similarly concluded that the production of Mo and Ru in proto-neutron star (PNS) winds from SNe are insufficient to account for the observed abundances of Mo and Ru at low metallicity without arbitrarily enhancing the production by about a factor of 30. They then considered that the required enhanced production factor might result from effects of a rapidly rotating PNS (although these models overpredict [Sr/Fe] and [Mo/Fe] at higher metallicity). The present work differs from that study in that we adopt standard production factors, and demonstrate that the required additional production at low metallicity can be attributed to the p-process contributions from HNe.
2. p-PROCESS
We estimate the abundances of p-nuclei produced through the p-process in both SNe II and HNe. In the case of SNe II, production of p-nuclei by the p-process is low in the early explosion

4
phase (t < 1s) because of the small entropy per baryon and long timescale associated with the early dynamical ejecta (Wanajo et al. 2018). We therefore focus on the p-process in the later explosion phase (t > 1s). We construct general relativistic steady-state, spherically symmetric neutrino driven winds as described in Otsuki et al. (2000). These models are calibrated with numerical results of 9, 12, 25, and 60M progenitor models in recent 3D core-collapse SN simulations (Burrows et al. 2020; Nagakura et al. 2021). The hydrodynamic quantities associated with the wind trajectories for each different progenitor model are derived by evolving the electron fraction Ye, the neutrino luminosity L, the neutrino mean energy E , the radius of the PNS R, and the gravitational mass of the PNS MPNS.
Existing hydrodynamic simulations of 3D explosion models stop at  1 s. We extrapolate them to later times by assuming an exponential decrease in the neutrino luminosity after the hydrodynamic simulations end at t = t0, L(t) = L,0 exp(-(t - t0)/), as used in Woosley et al. (1990). Here, L,0 is the neutrino luminosity at t = t0 and  = 1 s is the timescale for neutrino cooling. The values of t0 in the different models are shown in Table 2 of Burrows et al. (2020). We also assume that the evolution of the PNS radius is given by R(L) = (R0 - R1)(L/L,0) + R1 (Wanajo 2013) where R0 represents the radius of the PNS at t = t0 and R1 is the radius of the PNS after the neutrino cooling. We set R1 = 12 km, which satisfies the observational constraints on the radii of cold neutron stars (Steiner et al. 2013). Furthermore, we take into account the decrease of the neutrino temperature as the neutrino cooling proceeds. We assume that the neutrinos obey Fermi-Dirac distributions without chemical potentials, where the neutrino temperature T = E /3.151 is proportional to (LR-2)1/4 when t > t0 (Balantekin & Yu¨ksel 2005). This relation induces a decrease of T as L is reduced. Nucleosynthesis in the neutrino driven wind is calculated using nuclear network simulations. We follow the same numerical setup of the network simulations as that of Sasaki et al. (2017). We ignore the effect of neutrino oscillations because the energy spectra of different neutrino species in the present models are almost degenerate in the later explosion phase (t > 1 s). The total yield of a nucleus i inside a neutrino driven wind is written as yi = t=1s dt Xi(t)M (t) where M (t) and Xi(t) are the mass ejection rate and the mass fraction of the nucleus i inside the wind trajectory at time t. The total yields of p-nuclei in neutrino driven winds for the progenitor models with the initial masses of 9, 12, 25, and 60M are used as input data for the subsequent GCE calculations.
The p-process in the HN model is based upon neutrino-driven winds obtained in Fujibayashi et al. (2015) where the possible synthesis of heavy elements in a 100M progenitor star was investigated.

Time [s]

Figure 1. Time evolution of the p-nuclear yields in the p-process of the 25M SN model.

In this progenitor model, a massive PNS ( 3M ) is maintained for a few seconds before the black hole forms. We pick up the neutrino-driven wind model (e) in Table 3 of Fujibayashi et al. (2015) as the fiducial model of proton-rich neutrino-driven winds in HNe. The yield of p-nuclei is obtained by multiplying a typical lifetime of massive PNSs (NS  1 s) by the mass ejection rate (M ) and the mass fraction (Xi) of the p-nucleus in the trajectory of model (e).
Figure 1 illustrates the p-process production of p-nuclei inside neutrino driven winds at different times during a SNe II explosion. This figure shows the time evolution of the yields of 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru produced through the p-process in the 25M SN II model. The total yield yi is given by the time integration of Xi(t)M (t) as defined above.
General trends of the other progenitor models of 9M , 12M , and 60M are similar although the value of yi depends upon the progenitor models. The p-process is a primary process that proceeds without pre-existing seed nuclei originating from earlier generations of stars. The seed nuclei heavier than helium are synthesized in the early phase before the p-process (Wanajo et al. 2011) and the nucleosynthesis flow proceeds from these seed nuclei due to reactions with light particles such as protons and -particles.
The production yields of the p-process depend on the ratio of the number of free neutrons produced via p(¯e, e+)n to the number of seed nuclei, defined as n (Nishimura et al. 2019). Heavy p-nuclei are synthesized through the p-process for high n. Becuase the values of n in the wind trajectories of the 25M SN II model are smaller than 10, the p-process does not effectively produce heavy

6
nuclei around the mass number A 100-110 (Wanajo et al. 2011). Thus, the yields of the p-nuclei presented in Figure 1 are larger than those of p-nuclei heavier than A = 100 at any explosion time. The yield of each p-nucleus increases until t = 4 s because the entropy per baryon inside each wind trajectory also increases with decreasing neutrino luminosity (Otsuki et al. 2000; Wanajo 2013), and a high entropy per baryon is favorable for the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements.
In contrast, the smaller neutrino luminosity at t > 4 s suppresses the production of p-nuclei. This is because the larger expansion time scales of the wind trajectories at t > 4 s induce the production of large amounts of seed nuclei from which heavy elements are produced (Otsuki et al. 2000; Wanajo 2013; Xiong et al. 2020); this reduces the value of n [e.g., see Eq.(9) of Xiong et al. (2020)]. The mass ejection rate of each wind trajectory continues to decrease, and hence, the contribution from the later explosion phase (t > 5 s) is negligibly small in the present SNe II models.

Table 1. PNS masses and yields of the p-nuclei in the p-process of different progenitor models (in M ).

Table 1 shows the masses of the PNSs and the yields of 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru produced through the p-process in the adopted progenitor models. The 9, 12, 25, and 60M models correspond to the SNe II and the 100M model corresponds to the HN. The yields of p-nuclei are sensitive to the mass of the PNS. In the case of massive PNSs, the entropy per baryon of the wind trajectories becomes large and, in contrast, the expansion time scales becomes small (Otsuki et al. 2000; Wanajo et al. 2011; Wanajo 2013) because of general relativistic effects. Both conditions of the higher entropy and the shorter expansion time scale result in a higher value of n and a larger production of heavy p-nuclei in progenitor models having a more massive PNS. The yields of p-nuclei in the HN model is much larger than those in the SNe II models because the PNS mass of the HN model (MPNS = 3M ) is much heavier than those of the SNe II models (MPNS < 2M ). This implies that the p-process in HNe can play an important role in the GCE of Mo and Ru.
3. GCE

7
We have performed GCE calculations that include contributions from the p-process together with various other nucleosynthetic processes. We have then analyzed the relative contribution of the pprocess to the observed solar and stellar abundances of 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru. There are seven stable Mo isotopes. Among those, 92Mo and 94Mo are p-nuclei while 96Mo is an s-only nucleus because it is shielded by the stable isobars 96Ru and 96Zr against ± decays. The other isotopes are produced by the s- and r-processes. The nucleosynthetic origin of Ru is similar to that of Mo. The isotopes 96Ru and 98Ru are p-nuclei and 100Ru is an s-only isotope, whereas the other Ru isotopes are synthesized by both the s- and r-processes.
The framework of our GCE calculations for p-nuclei is based upon the one-zone model of Timmes et al. (1995); Yamazaki et al. (2021). This model includes exponentially decaying galactic inflow and a star formation rate calculated using a quadratic Schmidt function (Larson 1969).
The evolution of s- and r-nuclei with metallicity is taken from Kobayashi et al. (2020) and Yamazaki et al. (2021), respectively, except for p-nuclei. Although the GCE model used in Kobayashi et al. (2020) is different from ours, the GCE of the s-process depends very weakly on adopted models and the result is rather robust. Moreover, because the s-process is a secondary process and its progenitor is a long-lived low- or intermediate-mass star, it does not contribute strongly to the early GCE.
The production rate of each p-nucleus is derived from the event rate of SNe (including HNe) and the ejected mass of the synthesized p-nucleus associated with each progenitor. The mass range of HNe constrains its event rate through the initial mass function (IMF). We adopt the Kroupa IMF (Kroupa 2001) and set the mass range of zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) stars for SNe and HNe to be equal to 8-60M and 60-100M , respectively. In this configuration, 4% of massive stars explode as HNe and this fraction is consistent with the value recently deduced in Shivvers et al. (2017). The delay time  of the SN (HN) explosion of a massive star due to stellar evolution is set to be equal to the main sequence lifetime as a function of the ZAMS mass.
The input data of the p-process in the different progenitor models are summarized in Table 1. It has been pointed out (Travaglio et al. 2015) that the -process in Ia SNe contributes to the solar abundances of the p-nuclei. In our GCE calculation of p-nuclei, we take into account the contributions from SNe Ia by using the yields of p-nuclei from Kusakabe et al. (2011) in Case A1. Another possible major process is the -process in SNe II. To include the production of the SN -process in GCE, we employ the yields from the xi45 series of the KEPLER model (Travaglio et al. 2018). The yield data

of the xi45 model are given for seven different initial progenitor masses from M = 13M to 30M and 15 different metal mass fractions from Z = 0 to 3.1 × 10-2.
Figure 2(a) shows the final mass fractions of the p-nuclei at solar metallicity derived from the GCE calculation (circles). These are compared with the solar abundances (squares). The up and down triangles correspond to the contributions from the -process in SNe II only or the sum of SNe II and Ia, respectively. The red circles correspond to the total yields from the the p-process and -process. Figure 2(b) shows the ratios of the theoretical to observed solar abundances on a logarithmic scale. The contribution from the SN -process alone underproduces the solar abundances of 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru, and the contribution from SNe Ia is insignificant. In contrast, the p-process significantly enhances the theoretical abundances of these p-nuclei. The contribution from the p-process in Figure 2 mainly comes from HNe as shown in Table 1. A HN (SN) progenitor having a massive PNS enhances the contribution of the p-process to the solar abundances of the p-nuclei. The overproduction of 98Ru and 102Pd caused by the p-process reflects the dominant production factors

in our HN wind trajectory [see the middle panel of Figure 12 in Fujibayashi et al. (2015)]. This overproduction of heavy p-isotopes, however, may be suppressed if we used a recently proposed large triple- reaction rate (Jin et al. 2020) in our network calculations because their proposed four-body reaction mechanism may enhance the abundance of seed nuclei.
Figure 3 displays the elemental mass ratios [X/Fe] against [Fe/H], which are normalized at [Fe/H]=0. The filled circles are the observed stellar data taken from the SAGA database (Suda et al. 2008). The black dot and dashed-dot lines show the abundances from the r-process and the s-process, respectively. The thin dashed line (blue) in Figure 3(a) shows the summed abundances of the p-isotopes ([(92Mo +94 Mo)/Fe]) produced through the -process and the p-process in SNe without the p-process from HNe. The thin solid (red) line shows the abundances of the Mo p-isotopes produced from the -process, the p-process in SNe, and the p-process in HNe. The thick solid (red) line and the thick dashed (blue) line show the total elemental abundances in the present GCE model calculation with and without the contribution from the p-process in HNe, respectively. As shown by the thin dashed line (blue), the -process and p-process from SNe alone do not significantly account for the evolution of the Mo abundance over the entire metallicity range. In the region of [Fe/H] < -1, the contribution of the s-process is also negligibly small.

10
In contrast, the r-process (dotted line) makes a relatively large contribution for [Fe/H] < -1, but the amount of the r-nuclei is somewhat lower than the observed stellar ratios. As shown in the thin solid line (red), the p-process in HNe significantly enhances the abundance of the p-isotopes and, in the region of [Fe/H] < -2, the production by the HN p-process is larger than that of the r-process. Thus, HNe are the dominant contributor to the p-process for [Fe/H]< -2. The present result also indicates that the observed Mo abundances in the low metallicity region are predominantly produced through the p-process in HNe. Because population III stars in the early Galaxy are thought to be massive  100M (Hirano et al. 2014), our conclusion of the HN dominance in the low metallicity region seems reasonable.
Figure 3(b) similarly shows the elemental abundance of Ru with or without the p-process in HNe. The -process and the p-process in SNe II hardly affect the elemental abundances of Ru, and the p-process in HNe increases the elemental abundance in the low metallicity region. The contribution from the HN p-process on the Ru elemental abundance is not as prominent as Mo. This is because the total solar isotopic fractions of the p-isotopes 92,94Mo are as high as 24.1% but that of Ru (96,98Ru) is only 7.4%. We note that 92,94Mo could be also synthesized in slightly neutron-rich ejecta (Ye  0.47) (Bliss et al. 2018; Wanajo et al. 2018). If an early neutron-rich ejecta of core-collapse SNe at t < 1s were taken into account in the GCE calculations, the total abundances of Mo and Ru could increase and the theoretical prediction become more consistent with the observational stellar abundances.
As was discussed previously, the enhancement of the isotopic abundances of 92,94Mo correlates with that of the r-isotope 100Mo in primitive meteorites (Dauphas et al. 2002; Budde et al. 2016; Poole et al. 2017). Core-collapse SNe are still a viable candidate for the astrophysical site of the r-process. If a single SN happened near the proto-solar nebula and both the p- and r-processes occurred in the SN, their products would have contaminated the proto-solar material as observed in primitive meteorites.
4. CONCLUSION
We have calculated the p-process contribution in the neutrino-driven winds of core-collapse SNe (in particular including HNe) to the GCE of 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru. The contribution of the p-process in ordinary SN II is negligibly small and that of the HN p-process with massive PNSs dominates. The HN p-process contribution to the GCE of the p-nuclei is largest at low metallicity. We conclude that the high [Mo/Fe] ratios observed in metal-poor stars indicate that the p-process in HNe is the dominant source of 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru in the Galaxy.
