Abstract
We study dynamics of multi-soliton solutions of anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations for G = GL(2, C). The one-soliton solution has its principal peak of action density on a three-dimensional hyperplane, and therefore can be interpreted as a codimension-one soliton in four dimensional space. We call it the soliton wall. We prove that in the asymptotic region, the n-soliton solution possesses n isolated localized lumps of action density where each lump is a soliton wall. The n intersecting soliton walls preserve their shapes and "velocities" in the scattering process with position shifts of their peaks (known as the phase shifts). We calculate the phase shift factors explicitly and find that the action densities can be real-valued in the asymptotic region in four dimensional real spaces with signatures of the Euclidean, the Minkowski, and the Ultrahyperbolic. Furthermore, we show that the gauge group can be G = U(2) in the Ultrahyperbolic signature. This implies that the intersecting soliton walls are realized in all region in N=2 string theories. It is remarkable that quasideterminants play important roles in calculations and proofs.

1 Introduction
Soliton theory has been studied intensively and developed rapidly in the last sixty years while being related to various fields of mathematics and physics. Soliton equations are in general one of integrable systems and existence of multi-soliton solutions closely relates to their integrability. Sato's theory of solitons are one of the most beautiful theory which reveals infinite dimensional symmetry behind the KP equation and gives a unified viewpoint of lower-dimensional integrable systems [34]. In his theory, existence of integrable hierarchy and tau function is crucial. The tau functions are described by Wronskians which is a key to find that Hirota's bilinear equations are just Pluеcker relations which define an infinite dimensional Grassmann manifold. In real valued systems, the KP solitons are classified elegantly from the viewpoint of positive Grassmannians [20, 21].
On the other hand, in four dimension, anti-self-dual Yang-Mills (ASDYM) equations are known as important integrable systems. Their integrability is understood in the framework of twistor theory [37, 25]. The solution generating techniques associated to the twistor theory work well to generate various important solutions such as instantons. Furthermore, the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations can be reduced to various lowerdimensional integrable equations, such as the KdV equation, by suitable reduction procedures [36, 25]. Hence there might be expected to be some connection between twistor theory and Sato's theory, in other word, higher-dimensional extension of Sato's theory. The hierarchy structures are revealed [35], while the tau-functions are missing. Exact soliton solutions of the KP type are constructed in terms of determinants [2], however, not Wronskians. Furthermore such soliton solutions from simple ansatz give rise to trivial action density, and therefore, there has been only few studies in this direction. (e.g. [1, 3, 24])
In 2020, there was a progress that multi-soliton solutions of Wronskian-type to the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations are constructed in the noncommutative (NC) settings [9] by applying a Darboux transformation [27]. One soliton solutions for G = GL(2, C) are examined in detail on real spaces with three kind of signatures: the Euclidean E, the Minkowski M, and the Ultrahyperbolic E [18]. The action density of the one soliton solution has its principal peak on a three-dimensional hyperplane. Therefore, the solutions can be interpreted as codimension-one solitons in four dimensional space. In this paper, we call them the soliton walls to distinguish from domain walls. In the Ultrahyperbolic space, the gauge group can be U(2) and hence the solutions can be realized in N=2 string theory [29, 23]. In the next step, we should clarify whether the Wronskian solutions can include multi-soliton solutions and confirm the stability in the process of soliton scatterings, which guarantees integrability.

In this paper, we clarify that the Wronskian solutions actually describe intersecting multi-soliton walls by the analysis of asymptotic behavior of the solutions. We prove that in the asymptotic region, the n-soliton solution possesses n isolated localized lumps of action density. They preserve their shapes and "velocities" of the localized solitary wave lumps. Furthermore, we show that in the Ultrahyperbolic space, the gauge group can be U(2). Hence the multi-soliton solutions can be realized in the N=2 string theory in all region of the space-time as intersecting branes which might suggest new objects. The results are all brand-new and suggest possibility to develop Sato's formulation of the antiself-dual Yang-Mills equation. It is remarkable that quasideterminants play important roles in calculations and proofs.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we make a brief introduction to quasideterminants and summarize some properties of them. In section 3, we review antiself-dual Yang-Mills equations in four dimension and Wronskian solutions in terms of quasideterminants. In section 4, we examine some aspect of dynamics of exact n-soliton solutions. In subsection 4.1, we review exact one-soliton solutions and explicit action densities of them in three kind real space-times. In subsection 4.2, we study asymptotic behavior of the multi-soliton solutions, which is new. In section 5, we prove that the multi-soliton solutions can be embedded to G = U(2) gauge theory by showing that gauge fields are all anti-hermitian. Section 6 is devoted conclusion and discussion.

2 Brief Introduction to Quasideterminants

In this section, we give a brief introduction to quasideterminants defined first by Gelfand and Retakh [8]. For detailed discussion, see e.g. [7, 19]. Quasideterminants are not just a generalization of ordinary commutative determinants but rather related to inverse matrices. Here we assume existence of the inverses in any case.
Let A = (aij) be a nОn matrix and B = (bij) be the inverse matrix of A: AB = BA = 1. Matrix elements belong to a noncommutative ring. The (i, j)-th quasideterminant of A is defined as the inverse of an element of B = A-1:

|A|ij := b-ji1.

(2.1)

It is convenient to represent the (i, j)-th quasideterminant as follows:

a11 и и и a1j и и и a1n

...

...

...

|A|ij = ai1 и и и aij и и и ain .

...

...

...

an1 и и и anj и и и ann

(2.2)

We can write down a more explicit form of quasideterminants. In order to see it, let us recall the following formula for the inverse 2 О 2 block matrix:

AB Cd

-1
=

A-1 + A-1BS-1CA-1 -A-1BS-1

-S -1 C A-1

S -1

,

where A is a square matrix and d is a single element and S := d - CA-1B is called the Schur complement. We note that any matrix A can be decomposed as a 2 О 2 matrix by block decomposition where one of the diagonal parts is 1 О 1. By identifying this 1 О 1 element with aij, the (i, j)-th quasideterminant can be expressed as the inverse of the Schur complement:

|A|ij = aij -

aii ((Aij )-1)ij ajj

i (=i),j  (=j )

= aij -

aii (|Aij |ji )-1ajj.

i (=i),j  (=j )

(2.3)

By using this, explicit representations of the quasideterminants can be obtained iteratively. For example, for a 1 О 1 matrix A = a

|A| = a,

and for a 2 О 2 matrix A = (aij)

|A|11 =

a11 a21

|A|21 =

a11 a21

a12 a22

= a11 - a12a-221a21,

a12 a22

= a21 - a22a-121a11,

|A|12 =

a11 a21

|A|22 =

a11 a21

a12 a22

= a12 - a11a-211a22,

a12 a22

= a22 - a21a-111a12,

and for a 3 О 3 matrix A = (aij)

|A|11 =

a11 a12 a13 a21 a22 a23 = a11 - (a12, a13) a31 a32 a33

a22 a23 -1 a32 a33

a21 a31

=

and so on. We remark that the following quasideterminants are the same because expressions of
the Schur complement are the same.

Various properties and identities of quasideterminants are summarized in the following proposition, which are relevant to discussions in this paper.
Proposition 2.1 [8] Let A = (aij) be a square matrix of order n. In (iv) and (v), appropriate partitions are made so that all matrices in quasideterminants are square.
(i) Permutation of Rows and Columns The quasideterminant |A|ij does not depend on permutations of rows and columns in the matrix A that do not involve the i-th row and j-th column.

(ii) The multiplication of rows and columns

For any invertible elements j (j = 1, и и и , n), we have

a1,11 и и и a1,j j и и и a1,nn

...

...

...

a1,1 и и и a1,j и и и a1,n

...

...

...

...

...

...

...

an,11 и и и an,jj и и и an,nn

an,1 и и и an,j и и и an,n

We note that the common elements should appear in the right side (not left side) in a column. Row version is similar where the common elements k should appear in the left side in a row.

(iii) The addition of rows and columns

Let the matrix M = (mij) be obtained from the matrix A by replacing the k-th

row of A with the sum of the k-th row and l-th row, that is, mkj = akj + alj and

mij = aij for k = i. Then

|A|ij = |M |ij, for i = k.

(2.6)

Row version is similar.

(iv) Noncommutative Jacobi identity [11] (A useful special case of the noncommutative Sylvester's Theorem[8]):

We note that the definition of the quasideterminants and Proposition 2.1 are valid in the case that the matrix elements belong to noncommutative associative algebras, which include the case that all elements aij in (2.2) are N О N matrices. In this paper, we will consider such situations.

3 ASDYM Equations and Wronskian Solutions

In this section, we review anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations in 4-dimensional flat spaces whose real coordinates are denoted by xх (х = 0, 1, 2, 3). To facilitate the discussion, we set the gauge group to be G = GL(N, C) or subgroup of it in this paper.
Firstly, let us consider a four-dimensional complex with coordinates (z, z, w, w) and define the metric to be ds2 = 2(dzdz - dwdw). We can recover real spaces with various signatures by taking suitable real slice conditions on z, z, w, w. For example, the Euclidean real space E is given by z = z, w = -w, the Minkowski real space M is by z, z  R, w = w, and the Ultrahyperbolic real space U is by z, z, w, w  R. Explicit relations between z, z, w, w and xх are summatized in table in subsection 4.1.
Let us start with the following equation, called the Yang's equation :

z(zJ и J -1) - w(wJ и J -1) = 0,

(3.1)

where J is an N ОN complex matrix. Then the anti-self-dual gauge fields can be expressed explicitly by the solution J of Yang's equation in a special gauge:

Az = -zJ и J -1, Aw = -wJ и J -1, Az = Aw = 0,

(3.2)

We can easily to check that (3.2) actually satisfies the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equation in the complex space:

Fzw = 0, Fzw = 0, Fzz - Fww = 0,

(3.3)

where Fх := хA - Aх +[Aх, A] denotes the field strength. By taking real slice conditions on z, z, w, w as mentioned above, (3.3) reduces the standard anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations in four-dimensional real spaces in the sense of the Hodge dual operator.
Now let us consider the following linear system [27]:

L() := Jw(J-1) - (z) = 0, M () := Jz(J-1) - (w) = 0,

(3.4)

where  is a matrix generalization of the spectral parameter. More precisely,  is an N ОN constant matrix. We can show that the compatibility condition L(M()) - M(L()) = 0

5

implies Yang's equation (3.1) and the linear system (3.4) is covariant under the following Darboux transformation [27]:

 =  - -1, J = --1J,

(3.5)

where  is an eigenfunction of the linear system (3.4) for the choice of eigenvalue  = . After n iteration of the Darboux transformation, we get an exact solution of Yang's
equation from a trivial seed solution J = 1 and this kind of solution can be expressed in terms of quasideterminant in a compact form [27]:

1 и и и n 1

Jn =

11 и и и ...

nn ...

0 ... ,

11n-1 и и и nnn-1 0

1n1 и и и nnn 0

(3.6)

where (i, i) (i = 1, 2, и и и , n) are pairs of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the initial linear system for J = 1 in (3.4) :

wi = (zi)i, zi = (wi)i. The details and proofs can be found in [9] in the noncommutative setting.

(3.7)

4 Multi-Soliton Solutions of NC ASDYM equation

As mentioned in previous section, we can obtain n different pairs of (i, i) by solving (3.7) and use them to form exact solutions Jn of Yang's equation. One kind of an n-soliton solution for G = GL(2, C) in our previous work [9] is given by an interesting case of Jn which is composed by a special set of solutions of (3.7) [9]:

i =

aieLi bie-Mi cie-Li dieMi

, i =

i 0 0 хi

,

(4.1)

where i = 1, 2, и и и , n, Li = iiz + iz + iiw + iw, Mi := хiiz + iz + хiiw + iw, and i, хi, ai, bi, ci, di, i, i, i, i are complex constants. Furthermore, we confirm in subsection 4.2 that a reduced version of solution (4.1) (See also (4.6)) actually generates a multi-soliton configuration because this configuration it has n localized action densities in the asymptotic region and hence is stable in the scattering process.

4.1 One-Soliton Solutions of NC ASDYM equation

In this subsection we summarize some results and properties of the one-soliton solutions in our previous work [18]. The J-matrix is

J = --1,  =

aeL be-M ce-L deM

, =

0 0х

.

(4.2)

The action density of this kind of solution is calculated as follows:

TrF 2 = 8( - х)2( - )2 2sech2X - 3sech4X ,

where

X

:=

M

+

L

+

1 2

log(-ad/bc).

(4.3) (4.4)

We note that if the spectral parameter matrix  is a scalar matrix (i.e.  = х), the action density becomes trivial.
By imposing real slice conditions on the space-time coordinates z, z, w, w, and putting an additional condition on J-matrix: d = a, c = -b and M = L, we can get one-soliton solutions on different real spaces E, M and U and the corresponding the action densities take real value:

TrFх F х = C 2sech2X - 3sech4X ,

(4.5)

where X := L + L + log |a/b| and C is a real constant depending on the signature of different real spaces. We note that the principal peak of these action densities lies on a three-dimensional hyperplane defined by X = L + L + log(|a/b|) = 0 with normal vector lх + lх. Therefore, we can interpret them as codimension-one solitons in four dimensional spaces and use the terminology soliton walls in this paper to distinguish our solution from domain walls.
Main results of [18] are summarized in the following table:

4.2 Asymptotic Behavior of the n-Soliton Solutions

Now let us put the conditon: d = a, c = -b, M = L on (4.2) and discuss the asymptotic behavior of the n-soliton solution (i = 1, 2, и и и , n):

i =

aieLi bie-Li -bie-Li aieLi

, i =

i 0 0 хi

,

(4.6)

where Li = iiz + iz + iiw + iw, and ai, bi, i, i, i, хi  C. We assume here that Li (i = 1, 2, и и и , n) are independent with each other and there is no special relation between them. In other words, we just consider the situation of pure-soliton scattering and without any effect of resonance.
Inspired from a typical technique that used to discuss the asymptotic behavior of Wronskian type n-soliton solutions of KP equation. We prepare to follow a quite similar process to deal with the asymptotic problem of quasi-Wronskian type n-soliton solutions of the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations. It's actually not a trivial result because the elemnts i, i in the quasideterminant Jn are 2 О 2 matrices rather than a scalar function in Wronskian matrix. Firstly, let us pick an I  1, 2, ..., n and keep LI (and LI) to be finite. Then consider the asymptotic limit r := ((x1)2 + (x2)2 + (x3)2 + (x4)2)1/2  . Then for i = I, ReLi (= ReLi) goes to (i) positive infinity or (ii) negative infinity, that is, |eLi| (= |eLi|) goes to (i) positive infinity or (ii) zero. Then we can get the asymptotic form of Jn by eliminating right common factors in columns of the quasideterminant Jn

8

by using (2.5):

C1 и и и I и и и Cn 1

Jn 

C11 и и и ...

I I и и и Cnn

...

...

0 ...

C1n1 и и и I n1 и и и Cnnn 0

where (i) Ci =

10 01

or (ii)

01 -1 0

.

In the case of (i), Ci are unit matrices and hence we can move them to the right side of i. While in the case of (ii), Ci can be moved to right side as well because

Ciki =

01 -1 0

ki 0 0 хki

=

хki 0 0 ki

01 -1 0

.

As a result, the factor Ci can be eliminated in both cases. Without loss of generality, it suffices for us to consider the case of I = 1 from now
on because of the permutation property of the quasideterminants (Propositon 2.1 (i)). By applying the noncommutative Jacobi identity for the asymptotic form, Jn can be represented as the product of three kind of quasideterminants defined as follows:

In fact, Qn, Dn can be expanded in more explicit form and the proof is made by using mathematical induction. For n  2:

Qn =

Dn = (-1)nn и и и 2,

and for n = 1, it can be considered that Q1 is the same as (4.6) and D1 = 1 and hence the n = 1 case holds.
Let us assume that the statement holds for some n. Then, by using the noncommutative Jacobi identity and the column multiplication rule, we have

By repeating this process, we can prove the statement (4.8). If Qn has the following form, the action density is the same as that of one-soliton case:

Qn =

aI eLI -bI e-LI

bI e-LI aI eLI

.

(4.9)

The constants aI, bI relate to position shift of the one-soliton. The difference between aI, bI and aI , bI gives rise to additional position shift in the scattering process. This is called the phase shift.
From the result, we can evaluate the phase shift factor I,n explicitly. For example, in the Ultrahyperbolic signature U, the condition (4.9) is satisfied because of хI = I. Then the action density becomes

TrFх F х = 8 (I I - I I )(I - I ) 2 2sech2XI - 3sech4XI ,

(4.10)

where XI = LI + LI + log |aI /bI | = LI + LI + log |aI /bI | + I,n and the phase shift factor is

where the signature k is determined by that k = +1 for the case (i) and k = -1 for the case (ii).
In the Euclidean signatures, the realty condition хI = -1/I gives real valued phase shift which is seen from the log factor in (4.4):

In the Minkowski signatures, if i and хi are independent as in one-soliton case, the phase shift factor becomes in general complex. Hence in order that the phase shift factor is real, we need additional conditions such as хi = i in U or хi = -1/i in E.
In summary, we can conclude that the asymptotic behavior of the solutions (4.6) represents n intersecting soliton walls with phase shifts. This is a typical property of multi-soliton solutions as like the KP solitons.

5 Unitarity of the Multi-Soliton Solutions in U

Finally we prove that in the Ultrahyperbolic signature U, the multi-soliton solutions gives rise to anti-hermitian gauge fields, that is, the group is unitary. In order to do it, it is enough to show that J is unitary because the relationship between gauge fields and J is as follows:

Let us prove by induction that Jn is unitary when |i| = 1.

For n = 1, J1 = --1 where  =  = ||. Hence J1J1 = J1J1 = ||-1|| = 1.

We can easily find that U1 is unitary because U1 = Jn-1. Due to (2.4), Un is found to be
essentially the same as U1 by exchange of the first and the (n - 1)th columns and hence
unitary. Un is obtained from Un by replacement of n between two quasideterminants with -n 1 and hence unitary. We can prove that U1 = Un -1U1-1  U(2) by applying homological relation and the noncommutative Jacobi identity to Un -1.
We note that U1 - Un satisfies (U1 - Un)(U1 - Un) = (U1 - Un)(U1 - Un) = |U1 - Un|. Therefore Jn+1Jn+1 = Jn+1Jn+1 = |U1 - Un||U1 - Un|-1 = 1.

6 Conclusion and Discussion
In this paper, we discussed multi-soliton dynamics from the viewpoint of action density. We proved that in the asymptotic region by considering the comoving frame with the Ith soliton, the multi-soliton configuration is reduced to the I-th one-soliton configuration with phase shifts. The explicit phase shift factors are calculated for the Ultrahyperbolic and Euclidean signatures. This behavior is quite similar to the KP soliton scatterings [28, 26], which suggests possibility of Sato's formulation. In the Ultrahyperbolic signature, we proved that the J-matrix is unitary and hence gauge group can be U(2). The antiself-dual Yang-Mills equations are equations of motion of effective actions of open N=2 string theories [29, 23]. Our results show that intersecting soliton walls can be realized as three-dimensional branes in the N=2 string theory and there would be many implications and applications.

Extension of integrable systems to noncommutative space-time is interesting topics. (For reviews see, e.g. [14, 15, 22].) For the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations, asymptotic behavior of noncommutative multi-soliton solutions can be reduced to commutative ones [9], that is, intersecting multi-soliton walls presented here. This means that in the Ultrahyperbolic signature, the intersecting three-branes still exists in B-field backgrounds and unchanged in asymptotic regions. Furthermore, lower-dimensional integrable systems can be derived from the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations by reduction even in noncommutative space-time [12]. The present discussion could be applied to the lower-dimensional integrable equations as well because quasideterminants are fit to noncommutative settings (e.g. [5, 10, 11, 31]). In lower-dimension, multi-soliton solutions have the same asymptotic behavior as the present results [4, 12, 16, 30]
In the present discussion, we focused on pure soliton scattering process without resonance. The next step is to study the resonance processes which describe soliton wall reconnections. This would be realized by tuning parameters appropriately. Classification of all soliton wall configuration could be done by extension of Kodama's Grassmannian approach [20]. The Wronskian solutions here might have Sato's Maya diagram representations and lead to theory of tau functions which might relate to generalized Schur functions (see also [6, 32]), and perhaps finally to Sato's theory of the the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations, which would be a challenging problem as Mikio Sato suggests [33]
