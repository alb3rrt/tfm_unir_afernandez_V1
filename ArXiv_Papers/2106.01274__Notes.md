## Abstract

In this paper we consider an SPDE where the leading term is a second order systems with periodic boundary conditions with measurable coefficients in $(t,\omega)$ and HÃ¶lder continuous coefficients in space. Assuming stochastic parabolicity conditions, we prove $L^p((0,T), t^{\kappa} dt;H^{\sigma,q}(\mathbb{T}^d))$-estimates. The main novelty is that we do not require $p=q$. Moreover, we allow arbitrary $\sigma\in \mathbb{R}$ and weights in time. Such mixed regularity estimates play a crucial role in applications to nonlinear SPDEs which is clear from our previous work, and will be further applied in forthcoming papers on reaction diffusion equations and Navier-Stokes equations. To prove our main results we develop a general perturbation theory for SPDEs. Moreover, we prove a new result on pointwise multiplication in spaces with fractional smoothness.
