Hp-CORONA PROBLEM AND CONVEX DOMAINS OF FINITE TYPE
WILLIAM ALEXANDRE
Abstract. We prove that the Hp-corona problem has a solution for convex domains of finite type in Cn, n  2.

1. Introduction and main result

Let D be a domain in Cn and f1, . . . , fk be k functions in H(D), the algebra of

bounded holomorphic functions on D. Assume that for all z  D, the following inequality

holds true for some  > 0

k
|fj(z)|2  2.

j=1

To solve the H-Corona Problem on D is then to find k functions g1, . . . , gk in H(D)
such that for all z  D,
k

gj(z)fj(z) = 1.

j=1

The H-Corona Problem is solved by Carleson in [11] when D is the unit disc of C but is

still an open question when n  2, even if D is the ball or the polydisc. On the other side,

Sibony in [27] and Fornæss and Sibony in [14] construct bounded pseudoconvex domains

with smooth boundary and data f1, . . . , fk, such that the Corona Problem has no solution. It is an interesting question to know for which domains in Cn the Corona Problem may

have a solution. As pointed out by Amar in [3], being able to solve the Hp-Corona Problem

is a necessary condition to solve the H-Corona Problem. Let us state the Hp-Corona

Problem.

We write D as the set D = {z  Cn, r(z) < 0} where r is a smooth function on Cn

such that dr = 0 on the boundary of D. For   R, we denote by bD the boundary of D := {z  Cn, r(z) < }, and by d the euclidean area measure on bD.
The Hardy space Hp(D), p > 0, is the set of holomorphic functions f on D such that

By passing to the (almost everywhere) radial limit function, we may see the space Hp(D)

as a closed subspace of Lp(bD) (see [18]).

To solve the Hp-Corona Problem is to find for any h  Hp(D), k functions h1, . . . , hk  Hp(D) such that

Amar solves in [3] the Hp-Corona Problem on the ball of Cn, n  2, and for two generators (i.e. k = 2), for all 1 < p < . It is also solved by Andersson and Carlsson for 2 generators in [5] and for k generators in [6, 7] on strictly pseudoconvex domains. In [21], Lin proves that the Hp-Corona Problem has a solution for k generators, k  2, on the polydisc of Cn, n  2, 1 < p < +.
In this article, we solve the Hp-Corona Problem for 2 generators on convex domains of finite type.

Theorem 1.1. Let D  Cn, n  2, be a bounded convex domains of finite type with smooth boundary. Let f1, f2 in H(D) and  in R be such that |f1|2 + |f2|2  2 > 0 on D. Then for all 1 < p < , all h  Hp(D), there exist h1, h2  Hp(D) such that
h = h1f1 + h2f2.

In order to establish Theorem 1.1, as Amar [3] and Andersson-Carlsson [5] do, we follow Wolff's proof of the one variable Corona Theorem. We first put

It follows that

gi

=

|f1|2

fi +

|f2|2

,

i = 1, 2,



=

f1  f2 - f2  (|f1|2 + |f2|2

f1 )2

.

f1g1 + f2g2 = 1, g1 = -f2, g2 = f1 and  = 0.

For h holomorphic in D, we have (h) = 0. So one can find u such that u = h. Setting

h1 = hg1 + uf2, h2 = hg2 - uf1,

we have

h = f1h1 + f2h2,
h1 = hg1 + f2h = 0,
h2 = hg2 - f1h = 0.
Moreover, since g1, g2, f1 and f2 are bounded on D, if h belongs to Hp(D), h1 and h2 will also be in Hp(D) provided that u belongs to Lp(bD). So the proof of Theorem 1.1 is reduced to find u  Lp(bD) such that u = h, i.e. to solve a -equation with boundary estimates.

As in [11], [3], [5], Carleson measures are in the present paper an essential tool in order to the solve the Hp-Corona Problem. They are defined using the homogeneous structure of the boundary of the domain. For convex domains, one should use McNeal polydiscs defined in [22, 23, 24]. Since we need many objects in order to define them,

we postpone the definition of the set of Carleson measures W 1(D) and the set of (p, q)-

Carleson currents Wp1,q(D) to Section 2. We also define, in Section 2, BM O(bD), the space of functions of bounded mean oscillation on bD. We denote by W 0(D) the set

of bounded measures and by Wp0,q(D) the set of (p, q)-currents with bounded measure

coefficients. Then, for  ]0, 1[, W (D) is the complex interpolate space [W 0(D), W 1(D)]

and Wp,q = [Wp0,q(D), Wp1,q(D)].

If

the

existence

of

u

and

thus

Theorem

1.1

would

be

a

consequence

of Theorem 2.10 of [1]. But in general, this is not the case. One has to construct more

elaborate functions g1, g2

and  such that h

belongs

to

1-
W0,1

1 p

(D

).

This construction

is done by Carleson in the one variable case, but it seems too difficult to carry it out in

several variables. Instead, we use Wolff's approch who notices that |r|||2 and |r||| are

Carleson measures in the 1-dimensional case.

We use results of Jasiczak [17] in order to prove (see Subsection 4.1) that (h) satisfies

the hypothesis of Theorem 1.2 below. In this theorem and in the sequel, A B means

there exists a constant c > 0 such that A  cB and A B that A B and B A both

hold.

Theorem 1.2. Let D be a bounded convex domain of finite type in Cn, let  be a d-closed

(1, 1)-current. Then

(i) if |r|  belongs to W11,1(D), then there exists v such that  = iv and v BMO(bD)

|r|  W11,1(D), uniformly with respect to .

(ii)

if

|r| 

belongs

to

1-
W1,1

then

there

exists

v

such

that



=

iv

and v Lp(bD)

|r| 

, 1-
W1,1

1 p

(D)

uniformly

with

respect

to

.

So Theorem 1.2 gives us a function v such that v = (h). Since

(v - h) = v - (h) = 0, (v - h) = 2v - (h) = 0,

the 1-form v - h is d-closed and we can solve the d-equation for v - h : there exists a unique function w such that dw = v - h and w(0) = v(0), where 0 is any point in D. Since, v - h is a (0, 1)-form, we have

w = 0 and w = v - h.

Therefore w is holomorphic and u = v - w satisfies

u = v -  w
= h.
Moreover, since v already belongs to Lp(bD), u is in Lp(bD) if and only if w belongs to Hp(D). We will prove that this is indeed the case in Subsection 4.2 by methods similar to Amar and Andersson-Carlsson's method. This will solve the Hp-Corona Problem for 2 generators in convex domains of finite type.

WILLIAM ALEXANDRE

Many of the proofs in the present paper rely on interpolation, in particular between

H1(D) and BM OA(D). We thus have to know what are the intermediate spaces be-

tween them. We will prove in Section 3 that when D is a convex domain of finite type,

[H1(D),

B

M

OA(D)]1-

1 p

= Hp(D), 1 < p < +.

This result is also true when D is

strictly pseudoconvex and we prove it in the same way. However, the proof requires some

regularity conditions on the tools, in our case the -extremal basis, which define the ho-

mogeneous structure of the boundary of the domains, itself used to define BM O(bD)

and BM OA(D). When D is strictly pseudoconvex, the basis used are smooth, but not

McNeal's -extremal basis. We overcome this difficulty by using the Bergman metric. I want to thank E´ric Amar and Pierre Portal for helping me to understand the proof of the

interpolation between H1(D) and BM OA(D) when D is strictly pseudoconvex.

The article is thus organised as follows : in Section 2, we introduce the tools and objects relative to the structure of homogeneous spaces of D. In Section 3, we prove the interpolation results we need. In Section 4, we prove that h satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem 1.2 and that w belongs to Hp(D). In Section 5, we prove Theorem 1.2.

2. Notations

For z near bD,  > 0 and v  Cn, v = 0, we denote by  (z, v, ) the distance from z to {r = r(z) + } in the complex direction v :

 (z, v, ) := sup{t > 0, |r(z + v) - r(z)| < ,   C, || < t},

Using these distances, we define -extremal basis w1, . . . , wn at the point z, as given in [9] : w1 = z is the outer unit normal to bDr(z) at z and if w1, . . . , wi-1 are already defined, then wi is a unit vector orthogonal to w1, . . . , wi-1 such that  (z, wi, ) = sup vw1,...,wi-1  (z, v, ). When D is strictly convex, w1 is the outer unit normal to bDr(z)
v =1
and we may choose any basis of TzCbDr(z) for w2, . . . , wn . Therefore, when D is strictly
convex, an -extremal basis at z can be chosen smoothly depending on the point z. Un-

fortunately, this is not the case for convex domains of finite type (see [15]).

We put i(z, ) =  (z, wi, ), for i = 1, . . . , n. We have for a strictly convex domain

1(z, )

 and j(z, )

j

The

McNeal polydisc centered at z of radius  is the set

n
P(z) :=  = z + iwi  Cn, |i| < i(z, ), i = 1, . . . , n .
i=1

McNeal's polydiscs are used in order to define a pseudodistance . We set for , z near bD

(z, ) := inf{ > 0,   P(z)}.

Definition 2.1. We say that a positive finite measure µ on D is a Carleson measure and we write µ  W 1(D) if

µ

W 1(D)

:=

sup
zbD

µ(P(z)  D) (P(z)  bD)

Now we defined the notion of Carleson current already used in [1] and [2]. For z  Cn and v a non zero vector we set (see [9])

k(z, v)

:=



|r(z)| (z, v, |r(z)|)

.

For a fixed z, the convexity of D implies that the function defined by v  k(z, v) if v = 0, 0 otherwise, is a kind of non-isotropic norm which will play for us the role of weight in the definition of Carleson currents.

Definition 2.2. We say that a (p, q)-current µ of order 0 with measure coefficients is a (p, q)-Carleson current if

µ

:= sup
u1,...,up+q

where the supremum is taken over all smooth vector fields u1, . . . , up+q which never vanish
and where |µ(·)[u1, . . . , up+q]| is the absolute value of the measure µ(·)[u1, . . . , up+q]. We denote by Wp1,q(D) the set of all (p, q)-Carleson currents.

Let W 0 be the set of positive bounded measures on D. For µ  W 0, we put µ W 0 := µ(D). Analogously to Wp1,q(D) we define Wp0,q(D):

Definition 2.3. We say that µ is a (p, q)-current with bounded measure coefficients and we write µ  Wp0,q(D) if

µ

u1,...,up+q

For all  ]0, 1[ the space Wp,q(D) will denote the complex interpolate space between Wp0,q(D) and Wp1,q(D). One can "understand" these spaces by the work of Amar and Bonami who proved in [4]

Proposition 2.4. A measure µ belongs to W (D),  ]0, 1[, if and only if there exists a
1
Carleson measure µ1 and f  L 1- (bD, dµ1) such that µ = f dµ1.

3. The interpolation space [H1(D), BM OA(D)]

Let us first define the spaces BM O(bD) and BM OA(D). For f  L1loc(bD), we set

f

BM O(bD)

=

sup
zbD,r>0

Vol(bD

1 

Pr (z ))

f () - fbDPr(z) d()
bDPr (z )

where,

for

U



bD,

fU

=

1 Vol(U )

U f ()d() and Vol(U ) is the euclidean volume of U .

Reminding that H1(D) is a closed subset of L1(bD), the space BM OA(D) is the set :

BM OA(D) = {f  H1(D) / f BMO(bD) < +}.

It is well known that · BMO(bD) is not a norm because f BMO(bD) = 0 if f is constant. Therefore, as in [20], we equip BM OA(D) with the following norm defined for f  BM OA(D) by
f BMOA(D) = f 1 + f BMO(D).

6

WILLIAM ALEXANDRE

Let us recall the definition of the interpolation space [Hp(D), BM OA(D)], p  1,  ]0, 1[. First we equip Hp(D) + BM OA(D) = {0 + 1 / 0  Hp(D), 1  BM OA(D)} with the norm :  Hp(D)+BMOA(D) = inf{ 0 Hp(D) + 1 BMOA(D) / 0  Hp(D), 1  BM OA(D),  = 0 + 1}. Then an element f of [Hp(D), BM OA(D)] is a complex valued function such that there exists an application  : {z  C / 0  z  1}  Hp(D) + BM OA(D) which satisfies
(i) f = (),
(ii)  is continuous,
(iii)  is analytic on {z  C / 0 < z < 1} (iv) t  (it) and t  (1 + it) are continuous from R to Hp(D) and BM OA(D)
respectively,
(v) lim|t|+ (it) Hp(D) = 0 and lim|t|+ (1 + it) BMOA(D) = 0. The norm of f  [Hp(D), BM OA(D)] is

where the infimum is taken over all  satisfying (i-v) (see [8]). We will prove in this section

Now let S be the Szego¨ projector (see [18]). The Szego¨ projector in linear thus

 = S   is holomorphic on {z  C / 0 < z < 1}. From [25], Theorem 3.4 and

5.1, S : Lp(bD)  Hp(D) is continuous for all 1 < p < + and from [20], The-

orem 5.6, S : L(bD)  BM OA(D) is also continuous. Therefore  is continuous,

t  (it) and t  (1 + it) are continuous from R to Hp(D) and BM OA(D) respectively,

lim|t|+ (it) Lp(bD) = 0 and lim|t|+ (1 + it) L(bD) = 0. Morevover, since f is

and

since

Therefore, if # was linear, its continuity (established in Lemma 3.7) would just be a simple consequence of interpolation. Then, using Lemma 3.3, we would get

way.

In

[13],

Fefferman

and Stein linearize the operator #. This technic requires a measurability condition that

is not clearly satisfied in the case of convex domain of finite type because the extremal

basis may have a chaotic behaviour. However, even if McNeal's polydiscs do not depend

smoothly of  and , we will see that we can have a smooth approximation of them with

the Bergman metric because it is a smooth metric and because the ball centred at  of

radius 1 is almost equal to P|r()|(). This will allow us to define another maximal function which will be comparable to # and linearizable.

Without restriction, we assume that 0 belongs to D and we set

p() = inf{µ > 0 /   µD},

the gauge function of D, and r = p - 1. We have p() = p() for all  > 0. Therefore,

for all  > 0, all v  Cn, |v| = 1, all  > 0, we have  (, v, ) =  (, v, ).

We set, for  near bD and  > 0 small, (, ) :=

1 p( )-

.

When  is near bD, p()

is near 1 so (, ) is well defined. Moreover, we have |r (, ) | = (, ), thus

 (, ), v, |r (, ) | = (, ) (, v, ).

We now recall the definition and some properties of the Bergman metric that we will

need (see [26]). Let B(, z) denote the Bergman kernel, holomorphic with respect to z,

antiholomorphic with respect to  and let b(z) = (bij(z))i,j=1...,n be the matrix given by

bi,j(z) =

2  zi  zj

ln B(z, z).

The two following propositions are proved in [22] and [24] respectively.

Then,

Proposition 3.5. There exists 0 < c < C such that for all z  D near bD, all unit vector

Now we put for  near bD,  > 0 Q() =  + µv / µ  C, v  Cn, µv B,(,) < 1 ,

Note that the factor  in front of P() means blowing up the polydisc around its center and not just multiplying each point by . Now we prove

Proposition 3.6. There exist 0 < k < K such that for all   Cn near bD, all  > 0 small enough :
kP()  Q()  KP().

Proof : We only prove the inclusion kP()  Q(), the other one is similar. Let v  Cn, |v| = 1, µ  C be such that  + µv belongs to kP(), k > 0 to be determined. From Proposition 3.4, we get

|µ|  (, v, )

k.

Now  ((, ), v, (, )) = (, ) (, v, ) and |r((, ))| = (, ) so

|µ|  ((, ), v, |r((, ))|)

k ( ,

Therefore, by Proposition 3.5

µv B,(,)

Since (, ) is near 1, if k is small enough, uniformly in  and , we have µv B,(,)· < 1 and so  + µv belongs to Q().

Now we have all the tools we need in order to prove the continuity of #.

Since Vol(Q()  bD) Vol(P()  bD) Vol(PC()  bD) and since

fPC ( )bD |d

PC()bD |f - fPC()bD|d, we get

(4)

1 Vol(Q()  bD)

f - fPC()bD d
Q ( )bD

f #(z).

Now, using (4), we get

f #(z)

which implies, again with (4), that f (z) f #(z). The converse inequality is analogue.

Now, since Q() depends smoothly on  and , we can proceed as in [13] and linearize the maximal operator . Let X be the set of couples (, Q) where  : bD × bD  C is

measurable and satisfies || = 1 and Q : bD  {Q() /  > 0,   bD} is such that the map (, z)  1Q()(z) is measurable and, for all   bD,  belongs to Q(). Let us point out that in order to define such a function Q, it suffices to define two functions

 : bD  bD and  : bD ]0, +[ and to set Q() = Q()(()). Since 1Q()(z) = 1

if and only if

z - ()

B,

1 p(())-()

<

and

since

the

Bergman

metric

is

a

smooth

metric, (, z)  1Q()(z) is measurable as soon as that  and  are measurable. This

would not be the case, a priori, with McNeal's polydiscs instead of Q().

For g  L1loc(bD), we set U (g) = U(,Q)(g) (,Q)X where

U(,Q)(g)

:





1 Vol(Q( )



bD)

 Q( )bD

g() - gQ()bD (, )d().

The operator U is linear ; for all (, Q)  X, all   bD, U(,Q)(g)()  g() and for all   bD, sup(,Q)X U(,Q)(g)() = g(). In other words, for all   bD, U (g)() is an element of L(X) and U (g)() L(X) = g(). We set

L(bD, L(X)) = {f : bD  L(X) / f L(bD,L(X)) = sup f L(X) < },

Lp(bD, L(X)) = f : bD  L(X) / f Lp(bD,L(X)) :=

bD

By definition U : BM OA(bD)  L(bD, L(X)) is continuous. Moreover since g g#, from (2) we deduce that U : Hp(D)  Lp(bD, L(D)) is continuous. By interpolation,

for all  ]0, 1[,

U : [Hp(D), BM OA(D)]  Lp(bD), L(X)), L(bD, L(X)) 

is

continuous.

Since

for

,

Lp(bD, L(X)), L(bD, L(X))  =

Lq(bD, L(X)) (see Theorem 2.2.6 of [16]), we conclude that uniformly with respect to

g [Hp(D),BM OA(D)] .

We are now ready to prove the reciprocate of Lemma 3.2.

The form  is continuous

such

that

Since

reflexive,

from

Corollary

we

have

[H1(D), Hp(D)] = [H1(D), Hp(D)].

We

have

Hp(D)

where

1 p

+

1 p

=

1

and,

from

[20],

BM OA(D)

=

H1(D)

so

[H1(D), Hp(D)] = [BM OA(D), Hp(D)]

= [Hp(D), BM OA(D)]1-

12

For

q

such

that

1 q

=

 p

,

we

have

1 < p

and

1- =1-

p q

.

Thus

Corollary

3.9 implies that

[H1(D), Hp(D)] = [Hp(D), BM OA(D)]1- = Hq(D).

Therefore,

for

q

such

that

1 q

+

1 q

=

1

(which

implies

that

1 q

=

1-



+

 p

),

we

have

[H1(D), Hp(D)] = Hq(D).

Since [H1(D), Hp(D)] is a subspace of [H1(D), Hp(D)] which is reflexive since isomor-

phic to the reflexive space Hq(D), it follows that [H1(D), Hp(D)] is itself reflexive and so

[H1(D), Hp(D)]

=

Hq(D)

and

1 q

=

1- 1

 p

.

Now

we

prove

that

Hq (D)

we

 2q

and

so

[Hq(D), BM OA(D)] = H2q(D),

[H1(D), H2q(D)] = Hq(D).

Therefore,

for

we

get

from

Wolff 's

[28],

Theorem

:

[H1(D), BM OA(D)]s = Hq(D).

Since

we

done.

h (|f1 |2 +|f2 |2 )2

f1  f2 - f2  f1 , as defined in the introduction, satisfies the hypothesis

of Theorem 1.2. When  is a smooth p-form on D, Bruna, Charpentier and Dupain [9]

define

(z) k as a smooth function of z by

(z)

k

:=

supu1,...,up=0

|(z )(u1 ,...,up )| k(z,u1)...k(z,up)

which

is the norm of the form (z) with respect to the norm k(z, ·). The following theorem

The following theorem is Theorem 1.1 of [17]. This result, generally referred as CarlesonH¨ormander inequality, will be very useful for us.

Theorem 4.2 (Carleson-Ho¨rmander inequality). Let D be a bounded convex domain of finite type in Cn, let µ be a Carleson measure in D. Then for all 1 < p < +, all h  Hp(D), we have, uniformly with respect to h :

|h|pdµ  |h|pd.

We will also need the following lemma which is the analog of Proposition 2.1 of [5].

Since (h) = 0, (h) is d-closed. Thus Fact 4.5 below shows that (h) satisfies the

such

that

Proof : We have  k (7)

and since for all  and ,    k  k  k, we get

(8)

|r|  k

Since H(D)  BM OA(D), Fact 4.4 is then a consequence of (7), (8) and of Theorem

4.1.

Fact

all

Hp(D),

|r|(h)

and

|r|h  

belong

to

W1,1

(D

).

Proof : We treat separately the case h  H(D). Since (h) = h +h, it suffices to

prove that both |r|h and |r|h belongs to W11,1(D). Since for all vectors fields u1 and

u2

we

have

we just prove that |r| h   kdV and |r| h kdV are Carleson measure.

From fact 4.4, |rh|  kdV is a Carleson measure. Next, since h   k h k  k

for any 0  bD and all  > 0, we get from Theorem 4.1 and Fact 4.4 :

Now we treat the case h  Hp(D), p  [1, +[. It suffices to prove that |r| h  

belongs to

W11,-1

1 p

and |r| |h|



k

belong

to

W

1-

1 p

(D).

From Fact 4.4, |r|  kdV is a Carleson measure. The H¨ormander-Carleson inequal-

ity implies that h belongs to Lp(D, |r|  kdV ). Then, Proposition 2.4, |rh|  kdV

belongs

to

W

1-

1 p

(D).

Now

it

remains

to

prove

that

|r| h  

belongs

to

W11,-1

1 p

(D).

We proceed by in-

terpolation. Let us consider the linear operator T : h  h  . We prove that

T : H1(D)  W10,1(D) and T : BM OA(D)  W11,1(D) are continuous. Let h belongs to H1(D) and let u1 and u2 be two vectors fields. Then :

|r| |h  (u1, u2)| D k(·, u1)k(·, u2)

If h belongs to H1(D), Lemma 4.3 implies that

h H1(D).

Since,

Fact

4.4,

|r|

if h belongs

H¨ormander-

Carleson inequality yields

h H1(D) and so

|r| h   2kdV
D

h H1(D).

Thus, we have proved that T : H1(D)  W10,1(D) is continuous. Now for h  BM OA(D), u1 and u2 be two vectors fields, z0  bD,  > 0, we have

|r| |h  (u1, u2)| P(z0)bD k(·, u1)k(·, u2)

We thus have proved that T : BM OA(D)  W11,1(D) is continuous.

we

get

the

4.2. w belongs to Hp(D). Using that w is a holomorphic function such that w(0) = v(0)

and dw = v - h with v  Lp(bD) and h  Hp(D), we now prove that w is in

Hp(D).

Let

p

that

1 p

1 p

We test w against any function g  Hp(D)

and showing that bD gwd g Hp (D), uniformly with respect to g, we get by duality that w belongs to Hp(D). Moreover, since v belongs to Lp(bD), it suffices to prove that

bD g(w - v)d g Lp (bD) uniformly with respect to g. We use the following lemma.

Let K be a compact neighborhood of 0. Since G0 is of class C1(D \ K) and vanishes on bD, |r|-1G0 is bounded on D \ K. Thus, by Lemma 4.6 :

5. Proof of Theorem 1.2

The proof of Theorem 1.2 reduces to the 2 following theorems.

Theorem 5.1. Let D be a bounded convex domain with smooth boundary of finite type, let  be a closed positive (1, 1)-current such that |r| belongs to W1,1(D) for some   [0, 1]. Then there exists v real 1-form in W1(D) such that dv =  and

v W1 (D)

|r|  W1,1(D),

uniformly with respect to .

Theorem 5.2. Let D be a bounded convex domain with smooth boundary of finite type.

For

if 1  p < +,

· u BM O(bD)

v W01,1(D) if p = +.

Theorem 5.2 is Theorem 2.10 of [1]. Theorem 5.1 will be proved by interpolation. We admit it for the moment and prove Theorem 1.2.

Proof of Theorem 1.2 : This is classic, we include it for completness. Since  is positive, it is real and since  is d-closed, there exists v real 1-form such that idv = . We decompose v = -v1,0 + v0,1 where v0,1 is a (0, 1)-form and v1,0 a (1, 0)-form. For bidegree

Hp-CORONA PROBLEM AND CONVEX DOMAINS OF FINITE TYPE

reason v0,1 = 0. Let u be such that u = v0,1. We put w = 2u and, using v0,1 = v1,0, we get

iw = i(u + u)

= iu - iu

= iv0,1 - iv0,1 = idv = .

Now

when

v

is

given

by

Theorem

5.1,

v0,1

belongs

to

1-
W0,1

1 p

(D)

if

|r|

W1,1

1 p

(D)

and then, when u is given by Theorem 5.2, w belongs to BM O(bD) if p = + and to

Lp(bD) if 1  p < +.

Our goal is now to prove Theorem 5.1. We will use the homotopy operator of [2] that

we

now

recall.

Let 

be a C

smooth function

such

that (t) = 1 if t <

1 2

,

(t)

=

0

if

t > 1, and define the map h : D × [0, 1]  D for ||   by

h(z, t) = tz + t

1-t |r(z)|

1-t |r(z)|

A(z)

·



+

t

1-

1-t |r(z)|

A(tz) · 

where  and  have to be chosen sufficiently small, A(z) is a positive hermitian matrix, smoothly depending on z, such that A(z)-2 = B(z), B(z) being the matrix in the canonical basis which determines the Bergman metric · B,z at z, i.e. v B,z = vtB(z)v for any vector v. The map h is C-smooth in D×]0, 1[, h(z, 0) = 0 and h(z, 1) = z for all z in D.
The associated homotopy operator is

H

=

Vol(

1 n())

n ()

h d,
t[0,1]

where n() = {  Cn, || < }. If  is closed and if its support does not meet 0, then dH = .

Moreover, the author proved in [2] that for all closed positive (1, 1)-current  supported

away from the origin and such that |r|  belongs to W11,1(D), H belongs to W11(D) and

satisfies H W11(D)

|r|  W11,1(D).

We now prove that if |r|  belongs to W10,1(D), then H belongs to W10(D) and satisfies

H W10(D) |r|  W10,1(D). Theorem 5.1 will then follow by interpolation.

Let u be a non-vanishing vector field u. When we compute H(z)[u(z)], we get

(11)

H (z)[u(z)]

=

1 Vol(n())

(h(z, t))
n () t[0,1]

h t

(z,

t),

dz

h(z,

t)[u]

dtd.

Without restriction, we assume that the support of  is included in a small neighborhood

of bD. Therefore, in H, we integrate only for t  [t0, 1], t0 > 0. For z  D fixed, we

decompose

[t0, 1]

in

We

will

use

the

following

covering

lemma

:

Lemma 5.3. Let K > 0 be arbitrary big and 0 > 0 be arbitrary small. If c > 0 is small enough, there exists a sequence (zj)jNsuch that

20

WILLIAM ALEXANDRE

(i) D \ D-0 

+ j=0

Pc|r(zj

)|(zj

),

(ii) there exists M such that all z  D \ D-0, z belongs to at most M polydiscs

PcK|r(zj)|(zj ).

Proof : The sequence is constructed as follows. Let k be a non negative integer. We

pick a point z1(k) in the boundary of D-(1-c)k0 where  is a small positive number to be
chosen later. We then pick up successively points z2(k), z3(k), . . . in bD-(1-c)k0 such that
(zj(k), zl(k))  c(1 - c)k0 for all distinct j and l. Then, there exists  > 0 such that for j = l, Pc(1-c)k0(zj(k))  Pc(1-c)k0 (zl(k)) is empty and since bD-(1-c)k0 is compact, this process stops at some rank nk. Moreover, for all z  bD-(1-c)k0, there exists j such that z belongs to Pc(1-c)k0(zj(k)).
Let us prove that (i) holds true. For z  D\D-0, let k  N be such that (1-c)k+10 < |r(z)|  (1 - c)k0 and let   R be such that  = z + z belongs to bD-(1-c)k0 .
Then there exists j such that (, zj(k))  c(1 - c)k0. We also have (, z) = || 

c(1-c)k0. Therefore (z, zj(k)) c r zj(k) , and thus, if  has been chosen sufficiently

small,

z

belongs

to

P
cr

zj(k)

(zj(k)).

Now we prove (ii) of the lemma. Let  be a point in D \ D-0. If  belongs to

PcK r zj(k)

(zj ),

provided

c

is

small

enough,

we

have

So

there

put

Ik = j  {1, . . . , nk} /   PcK r zj(k) (zj )

and we show that #Ik is bounded, uniformly with respect to k. We have for C > 0,

t[1-

|r(z)|,1]

For fixed z and t, we make the substitution  = h(z, t),  running over n(). From

[2]

Lemma

2.15,

when

the

h(z, t)

belongs

to

for

some

then gives detR dh(z, t)

Now we want to change the order of integration. Intuitively, since t is sufficiently close to

1,  will belong to PcK|r(zj)|(zj ) for some K and z will belong to P|r()|().

If  is small enough, |r(z)|

|r( )|

because

and

because

1-t |r(z)|

P|r(z)|(z).

This implies,

if

even smaller,

that

t

belongs

to

|r(

We

also have (, zj ) (, z) + (z, zj ) c|r(zj)| so  belongs to PcK|r(zj)|(zj) for some K

which does not depend on j, c or . Therefore, c can be chosen small so that Lemma 5.3

holds true.

Since

we

Therefore
