A modular fusion category C allows one to define projective representations of the mapping class groups of closed surfaces of any genus. We show that if all these representations are irreducible, then C has a unique Morita-class of simple non-degenerate algebras, namely that of the tensor unit. This improves on a result by Andersen and Fjelstad, albeit under stronger assumptions. One motivation to look at this problem comes from questions in three-dimensional quantum gravity.

1. Introduction

Let C be a modular fusion category, that is, a finitely semisimple ribbon category with

simple tensor unit whose braiding is non-degenerate. Famously, such categories give rise

to three-dimensional topological quantum field theories [RT, Tu], and consequently also to

(projective) representations of surface mapping class groups.

In more detail, let I denote a choice of representatives of the isomorphism classes of

simple objects in C and write L = iI i  i. Denote by Modg the mapping class group of a closed genus-g surface without marked points. Then Modg acts projectively on the

Hom-space

VgC := C(1, Lg) ,

and we recall this action in Section 2.
An algebra A  C is called non-degenerate if its trace pairing is non-degenerate, see
Section 3 for details. Non-degenerate algebras carry a symmetric Frobenius structure. An
algebra is called simple if it is simple as a bimodule over itself. Two algebras A, B are Morita-equivalent if there are bimodules AXB and BYA in C such that X B Y = A and Y A X = B as bimodules.
Our main result is (see Theorem 5.1):

Theorem 1.1. Let C be a modular fusion category over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. If the projective mapping class group representations VgC are irreducible for all g  0, then every simple non-degenerate algebra in C is Morita-equivalent to the
tensor unit.

Suppose now that the modular fusion category C is defined over C. In this case, C is called pseudo-unitary if all simple objects have positive quantum dimension, see [ENO, Sec. 8] for details. Combining Theorem 1.1 with results on the existence of module traces in [Sch], it turns out we can drop the non-degeneracy condition (see Corollary 5.4):

Corollary 1.2. Suppose that in addition to the hypotheses in Theorem 1.1, C is defined over C and pseudo-unitary. Then all simple algebras in C are Morita-equivalent to the tensor unit.

2

A result closely related to Theorem 1.1 is proven in [AF1]. There it is shown that if there is a g  1 such that VgC is irreducible, then for every simple non-degenerate algebra A, its full centre Z(A)  C Crev has underlying object iI i × i. We recall the definition of the full centre in Section 4 and give a more detailed comparison to [AF1] in Section 5. Here we just note that under our stronger assumptions we can prove a stronger result,
which in this language means that the full centres satisfy Z(A) = Z(1) as algebras and
not only as objects. Our method of proof is quite different from that in [AF1] and so may be of independent interest.
Examples of C where all VgC are irreducible are when C is of Ising-type [JLLSW, RR], and when it is given by C(sl(2), k) ­ the modular fusion category for the affine Lie algebra sl(2) at level k ­ when k + 2 is prime [Ro]. We will look at these in more detail in Example 5.3, but it would certainly be good to have more examples at hand.
Remark 1.3.
1. The converse of the statement in Theorem 1.1 does not hold: C can have a unique Morita-class of simple non-degenerate algebras while e.g. VgC=1 is reducible. In fact this is the typical situation. For example, for C(sl(2), k) with k odd there is a unique such Morita-class [Os], but for k + 2 odd and not prime or the square of a prime, VgC=1 is reducible, see Example 5.3.
2. In Theorem 1.1 it is enough to demand irreducibility of VgC for 1  g  3N + 2, where N is the length of the filtration of the adjoint subring of the Grothendieck ring of C, see Remark 5.2 and Section 5.1 for details. A coarse bound for N is the number of isomorphism classes of simple objects of C, i.e. N  |I|.
A somewhat surprising motivation to look at irreducible mapping class group representations comes from quantum gravity in three dimensions. We summarise this in the next remark which can safely be skipped by readers less interested in speculations related to physics. Nonetheless, this is the reason why we started to study this problem.
Remark 1.4.
1. Euclidean AdS3 is topologically a solid torus. It has been argued in [MW] that the saddle-point approximation of the path integral of 3d quantum gravity includes a sum over geometries obtained by gluing the solid torus to its boundary by an element of SL(2, Z), the mapping class group of the torus. By the AdS/CFT-correspondence one would expect 3d quantum gravity on AdS3 to be equivalent to a 2d conformal field theory (or to an ensemble thereof) on its boundary, a 2-torus. One arrives at the following question: When does a sum over mapping class group orbits produce a consistent system of correlators of a 2d CFT? In the context of rational 2d CFT, this has been analysed for genus 1 in [CGHMV] and for all genera for the Ising CFT in [JLLSW]. The question whether one obtains a single 2d CFT or an ensemble has been investigated for WZW models in [MMS]. Comparing to the examples above, one finds that e.g. for SU (2)-WZW models on the torus there is a single CFT in particular at levels k with k + 2 prime, where the mapping class group is known to act irreducibly
3

on all VgC. We will show in [RR] that if the mapping class group orbits are finite (so that the sum is well-defined) and if the mapping class group representations are irreducible, then the sum produces a consistent system of rational 2d CFT correlators on surfaces of arbitrary genus and with insertion points.
2. Morita classes of simple non-degenerate algebras in a modular fusion category C describe indecomposable surface defects in the 3d TQFT corresponding to C [KaS, FSV, CRS]. In this context, Theorem 1.1 states that if all VgC are irreducible, then the corresponding 3d TQFT has no non-trivial surface defects. Invertible surface defects are global symmetries of the 3d TQFT, and their absence ties in with a conjectural constraint on quantum gravity theories, namely that they should have no global symmetries, see [HO] for a discussion in the context of AdS/CFT. Combining this with part 1, we see that, on the one hand, irreducibility of the VgC relates to consistency of the 2d CFT on the boundary and, on the other hand, to the absence of global symmetries of the 3d theory in the bulk. In fact, we obtain a stronger result, namely absence of all non-trivial surface defects, not just those related to global symmetries. We refer to [RR] for more details.
Before we start with the main part of the paper, let us mention the main ingredients in the proof. They are the mapping class group actions obtained from 3d TQFT [RT, Tu] (Section 2), the invariants under this action obtained from non-degenerate algebras [FRS, KR2] (Section 3), the relation between Morita classes of algebras and their full centres [KR1, ENO] (Section 4), and the universal grading group of a fusion category [GN] (Section 5.1). The proof in Section 5 then works by reducing the difference between the algebra structures of the full centre of a given algebra and that of the tensor unit to a symmetric 2-cocycle on the universal grading group, which must be a coboundary.

2. Mapping class group action on state spaces

In this section we briefly review how to obtain projective representations of surface mapping class groups from a modular fusion category.
Let g be a (smooth, compact, oriented, closed) surface of genus g  0. We will denote by Modg = Mod(g) the mapping class group, which is the group of isotopy classes of diffeomorphisms of g. Given a simple closed curve  on g, one can define the Dehn twist T as a mapping class in Modg [FM, Ch. 3]. In fact, the mapping class group is finitely generated by such Dehn twists. An explicit set of generators, called the Lickorish generators, consists of Dehn twists along the curves shown in Figure 2.1. Using these generators, one can define the so-called S-transformations Sk := Tk Tk Tk. Henceforth, we will use the alternative set of generators

T1, . . . , Tg , T1, . . . , Tg-1, S1, . . . , Sg ,

(2.1)

where we replaced the generators Tk by the corresponding S-transformations Sk.
Given a modular fusion category (MFC) C, the Reshetikhin-Turaev topological quantum field theory (RT-TQFT) for C gives rise to projective mapping class group representations [Tu, Ch. IV.5]. To describe these representations we first fix some notation.
We will write I for a set of representatives of the isomorphism classes of simple objects
in C, and we will assume that 1  I. Define the object

L=

i  i  C .

iI

(2.2)

This object is used in the description of surgery in RT-TQFT. The quantum dimension of an object U  C is denoted by dimC(U ), and we abbreviate

di = dimC(i) for i  I , D = dimC L =

iI (di)2 .

(2.3)

The choice of square root for D does not matter here, it just changes the normalisation of
one of the generators of the projective action below. We will denote the projective representation of Modg by VgC  V C(g). The underlying
vector space is the Hom-space

VgC  V C(g) := C(1, Lg) .

morphism fi : 1  i1  i1  · · ·  ig  ig.

The Hom-space V C(g) decomposes into the direct sum iIg Vi where i = (i1, . . . , ig) is
a multi-index and Vi := C(1, i1  i1  · · ·  ig  ig). The generators (2.1) act on fi  Vi as

follows:

Tk (fi) =

···  ··· fi

Sk(fi) =

··· ··· ik fi

(2.5)

Here we use string diagram notations for morphisms in C. Our diagrams are read from bottom to top and our conventions for dualities, braiding and twist match those in [FRS,
Sec. 2.1]. The constant ik  k× is the value of the ribbon twist on the simple object ik.
The expressions for the generators Tk and Sk are given e.g. in [BK, Def. 3.1.15].
Remark 2.1. The RT-TQFT is a symmetric monoidal functor from the category of surfaces with C-coloured marked points and three-dimensional bordisms with embedded Ccoloured ribbon graphs (equipped with certain additional decorations) to the category of
k-vector spaces [Tu, Ch. IV].
To a surface g without marked points, the RT-TQFT assigns the vector space V C(g). In terms of the TQFT, a vector fi  V C(g) is obtained by applying the TQFT-functor to the handlebody shown in Figure 2.2, thought of as a bordism   g. The action of []  Modg is obtained by evaluating the TQFT-functor on the mapping cylinder g ×[0, 1], where the index  indicates that one of the boundary parametrisations is given by , not by id. The projective nature of the representation originates from the extra decorations whose description we skipped. For example, for the choice of handlebody in Figure 2.2, the curves 1, . . . , g and 1, . . . g-1 are contractible and the corresponding Dehn twists will act on the morphism space by twisting the ribbons passing through these curves. This results in the expressions for Tk(fi) and Tk(fi) given in (2.5).
Given two MFCs C and D, the Deligne-product C D is obtained by taking pairs of
objects, one from C and one from D, and tensor products over k of Hom-spaces. Finally

6

one completes with respect to direct sums. In particular, for any closed surface ,

V C D() = V C() k V D()

(2.6)

as k-vector spaces. Let us write Crev for the category obtained from C by taking the inverse
braiding and twist. We will be particularly interested in the product

C± := C Crev .

(2.7)

The version of the object L in (2.2) for C± will be denoted by L :

L :=

(i × j)  (i × j)  C± .

i,jI

(2.8)

Accordingly, the mapping class group Modg acts on V C±(g) = C±(1 × 1, Lg).
The next lemma follows directly from [Tu, Lem. VII.4.3.1] (see [Tu, Sec. I.1.4] for the definition of C used in that lemma, which agrees with our Crev).
Lemma 2.2. There is an isomorphism V C±() = V C() k V C() which is equivariant with respect to the mapping class group action.
The action of Modg on V C(g) k V C(g) = Endk(V C(g)) is by conjugation, thus the projective factors cancel and we obtain a non-projective action. From Lemma 2.2 we get:

Corollary 2.3. Let  be a surface such that V C() is an irreducible projective mapping class group representation. Then the space of mapping class group invariants in V C±()

is one-dimensional,

dim V C±()Mod() = 1 .

Proof. The space of mapping class group invariants in V C()  V C() corresponds to the space of Mod()-equivariant maps EndMod()(V C()). By Schur's Lemma (for projective
representations), the latter is a one-dimensional. Lemma 2.2 then implies that the space of mapping class group invariants in V C±() is one-dimensional.

3. Modular invariant Frobenius algebras
In this section, we describe how to obtain mapping class group invariants from a modular invariant symmetric Frobenius algebra. We begin by recalling some algebraic notions following the conventions in [FRS]. We describe all notions in the MFC C, even though they make sense in much greater generality, see e.g. [FRS, FSt] or [EGNO, Sec. 7.8] for presentations in more general settings.
An algebra in C is an object A  C equipped with morphisms  : 1  A (unit) and
µ : A  A  A (product), subject to unitality and associativity. It is called commutative if µ  cA,A = µ, where cA,A denotes the braiding in C. Dually, a coalgebra C is an object
with morphisms  : C  1 (counit) and  : C  C  C (coproduct), which are subject
to counitality and coassociativity.

7

An algebra A  C is called simple if it is simple as a bimodule over itself. It is called
haploid if C(1, A) = k . A haploid algebra is automatically simple [FSc1, Lem. 4.5].
A Frobenius algebra is an object A  C equipped with an algebra and a coalgebra
structure satisfying the Frobenius property, which in string diagram notation reads

µ

.

(3.1)

In this diagram, all lines are labelled A and all diagrams give endomorphisms of A  A. The dots label product or coproduct as appropriate for the number of in/out going strands. We will omit the labels for (co)products below.
A Frobenius algebra A is -separable if µ   = id, and it is is special if    = 0 and
µ   =  id for some   k×. We call A normalised-special if  = 1, or, equivalently, if it
is -separable and special. A Frobenius algebra A is called symmetric if

A

A





=

(3.2)

AA As for product and coproduct, we will suppress the label  in the string diagram notation of the counit. The notation for the unit  is a horizontally flipped version of that for the counit.
Given an algebra A, define the morphism  : A  A as

=

.

(3.3)

A
An algebra A is called non-degenerate if  is an invertible morphism.
Lemma 3.1. Let A be a non-degenerate algebra in C. Then:
1. There is a unique coproduct and counit on A such that A becomes a symmetric Frobenius algebra on A, and such that the isomorphism A  A in (3.2) agrees with  in (3.3).

8

2. The Frobenius algebra in part 1 is -separable, and it is normalised-special iff dimC(A) = 0.

3. If A is simple, then dimC(A) = 0.

Parts 1 and 2 of this lemma are proved in [KR1, Lem. 2.3], for part 3 we refer to Appendix A.

Remark 3.2. The reason why we work with non-degenerate algebras instead of directly with Frobenius algebras is that being non-degenerate is a property of an algebra. Being Frobenius is, first of all, more data (coproduct and counit). It becomes a property when one adds the conditions of symmetry and -separability. Namely, an algebra is non-degenerate iff it is -separable symmetric Frobenius, cf. [KR1, Lem. 2.3]

For B  C± let {} be a basis of C±(i×j, B) and let {} be the dual basis of C±(B, i×j) in the sense that    = , idi×j. A key ingredient in our proof will be the notion of a modular invariant algebra from [KR2, Def. 3.1] (using the alternative formulation in [KR2, Lem. 3.2]).

Definition 3.3. An algebra B in C± is called modular invariant if B = idB and if the

product is S-invariant, i.e.

i×j

i×j

D2 =
didj 


.


B i×j

B i×j

Let B be a symmetric Frobenius algebra. For an integer n  2 we write (n) : B  Bn for the iterated coproduct, so that  = (2). For g  1 define the elements

C(B)g  V C±(g) = C±(1 × 1, Lg)

(3.4)

by setting

i1 × j1 i1 × j1 1 1

ig × jg ig × jg g g

C(B)g :=
i1,j1,...,ig,jg 1,...,g


(2g)


.

(3.5)



For g = 0 we have g = S2 and we set
C(B)0 :=     V C±(S2) = C±(1 × 1, 1 × 1) = k id1×1 .

(3.6)

The next proposition follows from [FRS, KR2, KLR], but it can also be shown directly and we give a short proof here for the convenience of the reader.

9

Proposition 3.4. Let B  C± be a non-degenerate modular invariant algebra. Then for each g  0 the vector C(B)g  V C±(g) is Modg-invariant.
Proof. For g = 0 there is nothing to show. Let thus g  1. We need to check that the generators in (2.5) (for the MFC C±) leave C(B)g invariant.
Tk: Invariance is immediate from the fact that B has a trivial twist, i.e. B = idB.
Tk: Choose the iterated coproduct (2g) such that the 2k'th and (2k + 1)'th strand form the output of one coproduct, i.e. write

(2g) =

id   id B(2k-1)

B(2g-2k-1)

 (2g-1) .

Invariance under Tk now boils down to the observation that BB   =   B = .

Sk: Choose the iterated coproduct (2g) such that the (2k - 1)'th and 2k'th strand form the output of one coproduct. Applying Sk to C(B)g only affects the (2k - 1)'th and 2k'th strand, and there we obtain:

ik × jk ik × jk m×n

ik × jk ik × jk

For the first expression in this computation, recall that we have to evaluate the

formula for Sk in (2.5) for C±. We take j ik × jk and ik m × n in (2.5), so that the prefactor there becomes dikdjk/D2. In step (1) we carry out the sum over m, n and k which gives the identity on B, and we use that B is -separable and symmetric

to remove . Step (2) is precisely S-invariance of B as in Definition 3.3. Step (3) is

easier to see backwards, and again uses that B is -separable and symmetric.

This shows that Sk  C(B)g = C(B)g.

10

Remark 3.5.
1. The construction of mapping class group invariants as in (3.5) first appeared in the study of consistent systems of correlators for rational 2d conformal field theories via 3d topological quantum field theories [FRS, FjFRS1]. There, V C±() describes the space of holomorphic times antiholomorphic conformal blocks, and a vector Cor()  V C±() describes a bulk correlation function on . To be consistent, the collection {Cor()} has to satisfy modular invariance and factorisation conditions. Here, we only make use of the former.
2. The categorical form of the modular invariance condition for algebras first appeared in [Kon, Sec. 6.1] in the context of vertex operator algebras and has been investigated in detail in [KR2]. The notion of a Cardy algebra from [Kon] was used in [KLR] to classify solutions to the open/closed factorisation and modular invariance conditions. In this context, the algebra B in Proposition 3.4 corresponds to the closed part of a Cardy algebra, and (3.5) is the correlator for a closed genus-g surface.
3. The classification of solutions to the consistency conditions in [KLR] relied on semisimplicty of C and C±. A more general approach applicable to non-semisimple modular tensor categories has been developed in [FSS, FSc2]. See in particular [FSS, Eqn. (5.3)] for the generalisation of (3.5) and [FSc2, Def. 4.9] for the definition of modular invariant algebras in this non-semisimple setting. These ingredients will be important when trying to generalise the present results to non-semisimple modular tensor categories.

4. The full centre

In this section, we recall the definition of the full centre of an algebra, as well as a result from [KR1] that will be used later for the proof of our main theorem.

Definition 4.1. The left centre Cl(A) of a non-degenerate algebra A is the image of the

idempotent Pl : A  A,

A

Pl =

.

A More details on the definition of left (and right) centres and their properties can be found e.g. in [FrFRS, Sec. 2.4]. The tensor functor T : C±  C, X × Y  X  Y admits a two-sided adjoint. Explicitly, the adjoint is given by R : C  C±, X  iI(X  i) × i, see [KR2, Sec. 2.4].
Definition 4.2. Let A  C be a non-degenerate algebra. The full centre of A is Z(A) = Cl(R(A))  C±.
Remark 4.3. The full centre was first introduced in [FjFRS2, Def. 4.9]. Actually, one can assign to an algebra A in a monoidal category M a commutative algebra in the

11

Drinfeld centre Z(M) which is characterised by a universal property [Da1]. The notion in Definition 4.2 is a special case of this more general characterisation.

The full centre is important in our construction because it produces modular invariant algebras. The following theorem is the first key input in our construction. It is shown in [KR1, Prop. 2.7] and [KR2, Thm. 3.18].

Theorem 4.4. Let A  C be a simple non-degenerate algebra. Then the full centre Z(A)  C± is a haploid commutative non-degenerate modular invariant algebra with dimC± Z(A) = D2.
Example 4.5. The fundamental example is to choose A = 1  C. We describe the Frobenius algebra structure of Z(1) explicitly, as we will need it later. The expressions
below are taken from [KR2, Eq. (2.58)], which gives R(A), together with the observation
that for A = 1 it is already commutative, and so equal to Z(1). The underlying object of Z(1) is iI i × i. The unit is given by the natural embedding of 1 × 1, while the counit is given by the projection to 1 × 1 times D2. Let {} be a basis of C(i  j, k) and {}
the dual basis in C(k, i  j) in the sense that    = ,. The product and coproduct are given by

(4.1)

We briefly recall the notions of bimodules and Morita equivalence. Let A and B be two
algebras. An A-B-bimodule T carries a left A-action A  T  T and a right B-action
T  B  T which commute with each other. Two algebras A and B are called Morita equivalent, if there exist an A-B-bimodule X and a B-A-bimodule Y such that X B Y = A and Y A X = B as bimodules.
The next theorem is the second key input for our construction, as it relates Morita
equivalence to isomorphisms of full centres.

Theorem 4.6 ([KR1, Thm. 1.1]). Let A and B be simple non-degenerate algebras. Then the following are equivalent:

1. A and B are Morita equivalent.

2. Z(A) and Z(B) are isomorphic as algebras.

12

5. Main theorem
We have now gathered the ingredients we need to state and prove our main theorem:
Theorem 5.1. Let C be a MFC such that the projective mapping class group representations VgC are irreducible for all g  0. Then C has a unique Morita class of simple
non-degenerate algebras, namely the Morita class of the tensor unit 1.
The proof is contained in Sections 5.2 and 5.3.
In [AF1, Thm. 1] the following closely related statement is shown:
Let A  C be a simple non-degenerate algebra such that Z(A) is not isomor-
phic to Z(1) as an object in C±. Then all projective mapping class group
representations VgC, g  1 are reducible.
In contrapositive form this reads: Suppose there is a g  1 such that VgC is irreducible.
Then for every simple non-degenerate algebra A one has that Z(A) is isomorphic to Z(1)
as an object in C±. From this point of view, on the one hand, Theorem 5.1 needs the stronger assumption
that VgC is irreducible for all g  0 (however, see Remark 5.2 (1) below). On the other hand, under these assumptions it gives a stronger result, namely together with Theorem 4.6 it
follows that Z(A) = Z(1) as algebras in C±, and not just as objects. This confirms an
expectation formulated in [AF1, Rem. 1], at least under our stronger assumptions. Our method to prove Theorem 5.1 is different from that used in [AF1], and thus may be of independent interest.
We note that it is not at all obvious that there are examples where Z(A) = Z(1) as
objects but not as algebras. Such examples were first provided in [Da2].1 In fact, that paper provides examples of Lagrangian algebras, but each such algebra can be realised as a full centre by [KR2, Thm. 3.22] (see also [DMNO, Prop. 4.8] for a more general statement).
Remark 5.2.
1. In the proof of Theorem 5.1 we actually need irreducibility of the representations VgC only for 1  g  3N + 2, where N is a bound introduced in Section 5.1 in terms of the adjoint subring. The place in the proof where this maximal g occurs is pointed out in Remark 5.19. The constant N in turn is trivially bounded by the number of isomorphism classes of simple objects, N  |I|. In other words, one can relax the hypothesis of Theorem 5.1 to assume irreducibility only for VgC with 1  g  3N + 2.
2. In this paper we exclude surfaces with marked points. Nonetheless, let us for the moment consider the surface 0,3, i.e. the sphere with three punctures, and assume that the punctures are labelled by simple objects, say i, j, k  I. The (framed, pure) mapping class group Mod(0,3) acts on V C(0,3) by rotation of the framing at the marked
1In these examples it is not required that all simple non-degenerate algebras have Z(A) = Z(1) as objects.
Thus these examples do not yet imply that the conclusion of Theorem 5.1 is indeed stronger than that of [AF1, Thm. 1].

points, and so by a scalar given by the corresponding twist eigenvalue. If V C(0,3) is non-zero, for Mod(0,3) to act irreducibly we must hence have dim V C(0,3) = 1.
On the other hand, V C(0,3) = C(1, i  j  k). Thus, requiring irreducibility of the
mapping class group action also on surfaces with marked points implies in particular that the fusion coefficients of C must satisfy Nijk  {0, 1}. Considering only surfaces without punctures, as we do, does not a priori impose this requirement, but we do not know any example where the VgC, g  0 are irreducible but Nijk > 1 can occur.
Example 5.3. The only examples with irreducible VgC's we are aware of are Ising-type categories and the MFC C(sl(2), k) associated to the affine Lie algebra sl(2) at certain levels k  Z>0. Let us list these examples, as well as some non-examples. (In all these examples it was already known that there is a unique Morita-class of simple non-degenerate algebras.)
1. It is shown in [Ro] that for C = C(sl(2), k) and r = k + 2 prime, all projective representations VgC, g  0 are irreducible. Most of the remaining cases can be excluded already by looking at g = 1. Namely by [GQ, App. A] and [CIZ, Prop. 1], invariants in the representation VgC=±1 are obtained from divisors d of r, with divisors d and r/d describing the same invariant subspace, and where d with d2 = r is excluded. Thus, when r  3 is not a prime or a square of a prime, the space of invariants satisfies dim(V1C±)Mod1 > 1, and so by Corollary 2.3, V1C is not irreducible. On the other hand, for k = 2 (r = 4), one obtains a category of Ising-type, for which all VgC are irreducible, see point 2. Some results on the irreducibility of VgC2 for the remaining cases of r = p2 with p > 2 prime can be found in [Kor].
2. The Ising model without marked points is studied in [CGHMV, JLLSW]. Irreducibility of all VgC, g  0 is shown in [JLLSW, Sec. 4.3]. In [RR] we will extend this result to all 16 Ising-type MFCs.
3. Let C = C(sl(N ), k) be the MFC for the affine Lie algebra sl(N ) at any level k  Z>0, for N  3. It is shown in [AF2, Thm. 3.6] that the VgC are reducible for each g  1.
4. For C(sl(2), k), irreducibility has also been studied for the mapping class group of surfaces with marked points, see [KoS, KM]. For Ising-type MFCs, irreducibility in the presence of marked points will be shown in [RR].
Theorem 5.1 can be reformulated using module categories. Namely, a C-module category is a category M together with a functor C × M  M and coherence isomorphisms, subject to associativity and unit conditions. A module category is indecomposable if it is not equivalent, as a C-module category, to a direct sum of non-trivial module categories. It is shown in [Os, Sec. 3.3] that there is a one-to-one correspondence between Moritaclasses of simple algebras in C and semisimple indecomposable C-module categories (given by passing from an algebra A to the category of right A-modules in C).
In order to have a correspondence with Frobenius algebras, one needs to equip the module categories with a module trace [Sch], i.e. a family of maps {M }MM with M : End(M ) 
14

k, subject compatibility conditions with the pivotal structure of C, see [Sch, Sec. 3.2]. From
[Sch, Thm. 6.6, Prop. 6.8] we get the following reformulation of Theorem 5.1:
Theorem 5.1 (v2). Let C be a MFC such that the projective mapping class group representations VgC are irreducible for all g  0. Then there is up to equivalence a unique semisimple indecomposable C-module category with module trace, namely C itself.
As an application of this point of view, let us explain how under certain conditions the
non-degeneracy of a simple algebra is implied. The MFC C is called pseudo-unitary if k = C
and if the quantum dimensions of all simple objects are positive. By [Sch, Prop. 5.8], for pseudo-unitary C, a semisimple C-module category can be equipped with a module trace. Hence in this situation we can drop the existence of a module trace from Theorem 5.1 (v2). We obtain the following corollary to Theorem 5.1 (see also [Sch, Cor. 6.11]):
Corollary 5.4. Suppose that in addition to the hypotheses in Theorem 5.1, C is pseudounitary. Then all simple algebras in C are Morita-equivalent to the tensor unit.
Before going into the details, let us briefly sketch the proof of Theorem 5.1. By Theorem 4.6 it suffices to show that for any simple non-degenerate algebra A we have
Z(A) = Z(1) as algebras. To obtain this isomorphism we proceed in several steps:
1. In Section 5.1 we will review the notion of the adjoint subring and universal grading group as well as the bound N mentioned in Remark 5.2.
2. In Section 5.2, we will use irreducibility on the torus and obtain multiplication con-
stants (kij) relating the structure morphisms of Z(A) to those of Z(1). Furthermore,
we use irreducibility for genus 2 to obtain constants kij independent of the multiplicity labels , . We then use irreducibility for g > 2 to obtain constraints on the kij .
3. In Section 5.3 we construct a sequence of algebra isomorphisms using the results of the previous step and the universal grading group to arrive to an algebra isomorphism
Z(A) = Z(1).
5.1. The adjoint subring and the universal grading group
We briefly recall from [GN] the notion of the universal grading group and of the adjoint subring (see also [EGNO, Ch. 3]).
Let F be a fusion category and I a set of representatives of isomorphism classes of simple objects in F. The duality on F defines an involution ( ) : I  I by requiring that i = i. Then, the Grothendieck ring Gr(F )  R is a unital based ring with basis {bi}iI. The ring R is transitive in the sense that for any i, j  I there exists k  I such that Nijk = 0.
Definition 5.5. The adjoint subring Rad  R is generated by all basis elements contained in bibi for some i  I. We denote by Iad  I the index set of the basis {bi}iIad of Rad.
15

It is shown in [GN, Thm. 3.5] that the ring R decomposes into a direct sum of indecomposable based Rad-bimodules R = gG Rg, and that the product of R induces a group structure on G with Re = Rad. In particular, R is a faithful G-graded ring. The set Ig  I will denote the index set of the basis {bi}iIg of Rg. Transitivity of R now implies that Rad acts transitively on Rg for each g  G: for all x, y  Ig there is i  Iad such that Nxiy = 0.
Definition 5.6. The group G is called the universal grading group of R.

We define a filtration on Rad as follows. For i  Iad let n(i) be the minimal integer such that bi is contained in bm1bm1 . . . b b mn(i) mn(i) for some m1, . . . , mn(i)  I. Such labels exist
by the definition of the adjoint subring. For the unit we set n(1) = 0. Setting

Ra(nd) = bi  Rad | n(i)  n .

(5.1)

we get the filtration

Z b1 = Ra(0d)  Ra(1d)  Ra(2d)  · · ·

(5.2)

of Rad. Let N denote the minimal number such that Ra(Nd ) = Rad. Since the filtration is strictly increasing until degree N , and since Iad  I, we trivially have that N  |I|.

5.2. Structure constants

Let A  C be a simple non-degenerate algebra. By Theorem 4.4 and Lemma 3.1 the full centre Z(A) is a haploid normalised-special commutative symmetric modular invariant Frobenius algebra.
Lemma 5.7. The full centre Z(A) has the same underlying object as Z(1), i.e. Z(A) =
iI i × i as objects in C±.
Proof. By [KR2, Eq. (3.7)], the matrix Z(A)ij = dim C±(i × j, Z(A)) commutes with the S-generator, and it commutes with the T -generator since Z(A) has trivial twist. By irreducibility of VgC=1, the space of invariants in VgC=±1 is one-dimensional (Corollary 2.3).
Hence there exists a constant   k such that

Z(A)ij =  Z(1)ij =  ij .

(5.3)

By haploidity, Z(A)11 = 1 and therefore  = 1. Altogether, dim C±(i × j, Z(A)) = i,j i.e. the underlying object of Z(A) is iI i × i.
Denote by ei : i × i  Z(A) and ri : Z(A)  i × i the embedding and projection of i × i as a subobject of Z(A), i.e. ri  ei = id. Given the underlying object of Z(A) as in Lemma 5.7, we now make a general ansatz for the Frobenius algebra structure on Z(A).
Namely, in terms of constants 0, 0, (kij), (ikj)  k we set

Z(A) = 0 e1 Z(A) = 0 D2 r1

(5.4)

On the right hand side of µZ(A) we did not spell out the embedding and projection morphisms rk  (· · · )  (ei  ej), and dito for Z(A).

Lemma 5.8. The elements C(Z(A))g from (3.5) are non-zero for every g  0.

Proof. The element C(Z(A))0 is non-zero since Z(A)  Z(A) = dimC±(Z(A)) = D2, where
the first equality follows from the symmetric normalised-special Frobenius algebra struc-
ture. Now, let g  1 and consider in (3.5) the summand of C(Z(A))g where im = jm = 1 for m = 1, . . . , g. Since 1 × 1 appears in Z(A) with multiplicity one, there is no sum
over multiplicities. Up to factors of 0D2 = 0, the result is the same as composing all
out-going Z(A)-factors with the counit Z(A). The overall expression then reduces to Z(A)  Z(A) = D2.

As in [FRS, Sec. 2.2], for every i  I fix an isomorphism i : i  i, which exists by

definition of the involution i  i. We use these isomorphisms to express the fusion basis

in C(i  i, 1) and its dual in terms of dualities in C. Namely, there exist i, ~i  k× such

that

as the respective morphism spaces are one-dimensional. By the normalisation chosen for

(5.6)

In the following lemma we will give the isomorphism  for Z(A) in a basis, which will later be used to express the modular invariants C(Z(A))g.

where the horizontal line denotes the identity idi. The last equality follows from (5.5) and (5.6).

The allowed structure constants are non-zero, diagonal and independent of the multiplicity index:

Lemma 5.10. For i, j, k  I with Nijk = 0 we have (kij) = , kij and (ikj) = , ikj with kij, ikj = 0.
Proof. Consider the modular invariant vector C(Z(A))g=2 as defined in (3.5), which is given as2
i × i i × i k × k k × k i × i i × i k × k k × k


C(Z(A))2 =

where the horizontal lines denote the embeddings and projections, and where we used that

Since C(Z(A))2 and C(Z(1))2 are both modular invariant vectors and the space of invariants is one-dimensional, and since C(Z(A))2 and C(Z(1))2 are non-zero by Lemma 5.8 there exists 2  k× such that

C(Z(A))2 = 2 C(Z(1))2 .

(5.8)

Let i, j, k  I such that Nijk = 0, then by comparing both sides of (5.8) and using

Example 4.5 we obtain

0 1ii (ijk) (ikj ) = , , 2 .

(5.9)

For  =  and  =  we get

0 1ii (ijk) (ikj) = 2 = 0 .

(5.10)

This shows that (ijk) and (ikj) are non-zero and independent of , . I.e. for Nijk = 0
there exists ikj  k× such that (ikj) = ikj for  = 1, . . . , Nijk. Taking  =  but  =  in
(5.9) gives the desired form for the comultiplication structure constants

(ikj ) = , ikj .

(5.11)

To get also the expression for the structure constants of the product as claimed in the lemma, insert (5.4) into µ = ((  µ)  id)  (id ). This gives

with

kij

ijk

(kij ) = , 0 1ii ijk = , kij ,

(5.12)

Lemma 5.11. The structure constants obey the following properties:

1. (Unitality and counitality) i1i = ii1 = 0-1 and 1i i = ii1 = -0 1

2. (Commutativity) kij = kji

3.

(Index

and

raising)

kij

=

and

ikj

i1i

j ik

Proof. Part 1 follows directly by evaluating the unitality and the counitality conditions for
the morphisms in (5.4). For part 2, let i, j, k  I with Nijk = 0. From Lemma 5.10 we get

rk  µZ(A)  (ei  ej) = kij rk  µZ(1)  (ei  ej) .

(5.13)

Composing both sides of this equation with the braiding cj,i : j  i  i  j and using naturality, we get

rk  µZ(A)  cZ(A),Z(A)  (ej  ei) = kij rk  µZ(1)  cZ(1),Z(1)  (ej  ei) = kij rk  µZ(1)  (ej  ei) .

(5.14)

In the last step we used the commutativity of Z(1). Making use of commutativity of Z(A),
i.e. µZ(A)  cZ(A),Z(A) = µZ(A), finally implies part 2. In part 3, the first equality was already given at the end of the previous proof, and the
second follows analogously by inserting (5.4) into  = (id µ)  ((  )  id).

5.3. Sequence of isomorphisms

Given an object automorphism f  Aut(Z(A)), one can give an isomorphic (haploid commutative symmetric normalised-special modular invariant) Frobenius algebra Z~ 
f(Z(A)). Its underlying object is again Z(A) but its structure morphisms are

µ~ = f  µZ(A)  (f -1  f -1) , ~ = (f  f )  Z(A)  f -1 ,

~ = f  Z(A) , ~ = Z(A)  f -1 .

(5.15)

This is the unique Frobenius algebra structure such that f : Z(A)  Z~ is an isomorphism

of Frobenius algebras.

The isomorphism f is determined by invertible scalars {fi} as the underlying object of Z(A) is iI i × i:

f = fi ei  ri .

(5.16)

iI

The new structure constants are then given by

~kij

=

fk fifj

kij

,

~ikj

=

fifj fk

ikj

,

~0 = f1 0 ,

~0 = f1-1 0 .

(5.17)

The new constants defined as above still obey the equations of Lemmata 5.11 and 5.13.
We will find a sequence of such Frobenius algebra isomorphisms that take Z(A) into
Z(1). In other words, we need to find (a sequence of) transformations fi such that ~0 =
~0 = 1 and ~kij = ~ikj = 1 whenever Nijk = 0.

First Step

Our first step will be to normalise the constants ii1, i1i and 1ii. We do this by fixing

fi such that fifi = 1111ii (for instance pick any square root fi = fi =

111

1 ) ii

and

fix

f1 = 111. For example,

~1ii

=

f1 fi fi

1ii

=

111 1111ii

1ii

=

1.

(5.18)

Assuming we applied this isomorphism, we may now start with constants such that ii1 = i1i = 1 = 1ii for all i  I. By Lemma 5.11, this implies 0 = 0 = 1, as well as

ikj

=

j ik

.

(5.19)

i.e. we can raise or lower indices by conjugating the respective label. To avoid confusion,
we will denote this algebra by Z, which is isomorphic to Z(A) as a Frobenius algebra. The above conditions on kij, ikj, 0, 0 are preserved by isomorphisms f that satisfy

f1 = 1 and fifi = 1 for all i  I .

(5.20)

20

Second Step
To exploit the irreducibility of the VgC for higher genus, it is convenient to introduce the notion of an I-fusion tree.
Definition 5.12. · A 3-valent tree is a tree graph, where each vertex is 3-valent with one incoming edge and two outgoing edges.
· An I-fusion tree is a 3-valent tree such that each edge is labelled by an element in I, and such that at each vertex v the following condition is satisfied: if the incoming edge at v is labelled k and the two outgoing edges at v are labelled i, j, then Nijk = 0. The outgoing edges of an I-fusion tree are ordered (we will label them 1, . . . , m).
· Let i, j1, . . . , jm  I. An (i; j1, . . . , jm)-fusion tree is an I-fusion tree such that the incoming edge is labelled by i and the outgoing edges are labelled by j1, . . . , jm.
We stress that an I-fusion tree  is not a string diagram in C. Namely,  only records labels in I and does not include a specific morphism at each vertex.
Let Z be a Frobenius algebra isomorphic to Z(A) as a Frobenius algebra, and with structure constants ikj, etc., normalised as in the first step. To a vertex v of an I-fusion tree with incoming label k and outgoing labels i, j we assign the number (v) := ikj. To the whole I-fusion tree we assign the product of the structure constants at each vertex,

 : {I-fusion trees} - k× ,  - () =

(v) .

v vertex

(5.21)

Lemma 5.13. Let i1, . . . , ig  I and  be a (1; i1, i1, . . . , ig, ig)-fusion tree. Then

() = 1 ,

(5.22)

independent of the choice of i1, . . . , ig and .

Proof. By irreducibility of the VgC and by Lemma 5.8 there is a g  k× such that

C(Z)g = g C(Z(1))g .

(5.23)

Fix a 3-valent tree  with 2g leaves. By decorating each vertex with the coproduct, each such tree gives a realisation of the iterated coproduct (2g) : Z  Z2g. Using labellings
of  by I, we get a direct sum decomposition

Z(2g)  Z =

() D .



(5.24)

Here, the direct sum runs over I-fusion trees  with underlying unlabelled tree , where
the unique incoming edge is labelled by 1. The factor () is the product of structure
constants as defined in (5.21). D is the summand of Z(2g) Z where for an edge labelled k

21

the corresponding tensor factor Z is projected to k × k. The following example illustrates

the procedure for g = 2:

i1 × i1 i1 × i1 i2 × i2 i2 × i2

i1 i1 i2 i2

Z(1)

Z(1)

=

D = k × k

k × k

Z(1)

1×1

(5.25)
Here, the coproduct is that of Z(1) as given in (4.1), for which all structure constants are
1.
The important point to realise is that the D are linearly independent for the different choices of  (but for fixed ). This can be seen for example by composing with the
corresponding dual graph with in- and outgoing edges exchanged, which provides a non-
degenerate pairing.
We can thus evaluate (5.23) summand by summand. For Z we get a factor () as
in (5.21), while for Z(1) the structure constants are all 1. Altogether we obtain, for all
I-fusion trees  with underlying 3-valent tree ,

() D = g D .

(5.26)

Finally, to compute g, take the I-fusion tree  where all edges are labelled by 1. Since
111 = 1, this results in () = 1.

The next lemma is the first place where the universal grading group becomes important. Namely, the elements in the neutral component Rad are precisely those that "can be created by handles" (cf. Figure 2.2). This property can be used to set the corresponding structure constants to 1:

Lemma 5.14. There exist fi satisfying (5.20) such that ~ikj = 1 for all i, j, k  Iad with Nijk = 0.

Proof. Recall the filtration of the adjoint subring given in (5.2). For bi  Ra(nd), i = 1 there
are m1, . . . , mn such that bi is contained bm1bm1 . . . bmnbmn. In other words, there exists a (i; m1, m1, . . . , mn, mn)-fusion tree

finally

gives

ikj

i.e. ~ikj

We will need to know how the (i) change in the new normalisation given by the fi.

We have

~(i)

··· fi

(i)

=

(5.31)

since fmfm = 1 and fi = (i). Note that in the proof of Lemma 5.14 we have only used the irreducibility of VgC up to
g = 3N , where N was defined in Section 5.1 to be the maximal degree in the filtration of

Rad. Below we will need to go up to g = 3N + 2, see Remark 5.19.

Let i, j, k  I be such that Nijk = 0. At this point we have achieved ikj = 1 whenever
at least one of i, j, k is given by 1 (Step 1), and ikj = 1 for i, j, k  Iad (Step 2). We
are still free to choose all fi with i / Iad, subject to (5.20). Recall that in the proof of
Lemma 5.14 we fixed a fusion graph i for each i  Iad, and that by (5.31) we have in the
new normalisation:

(i) = 1 for i  Iad .

(5.32)

Third Step
The following lemma is an extension of Lemma 5.13 to allow any reordering of the outgoing labels.

23

Lemma 5.15. Let i1, . . . , ig  I,   S2g and  be a (1; (i1, i1 . . . , ig, ig).)-fusion tree
where the permutation  acts by changing the order of the 2g outgoing labels accordingly. Then () = 1.

Proof. Let 2g be any 2g-braid, whose underlying permutation is   S2g. Since Z and
Z(1) are cocommutative, we have 2g  (2g) = (2g) for both of them.
We proceed as in the proof of Lemma 5.13 by expressing Z  Z as a direct sum where
such fusion trees appear. Using cocommutativity of Z and Z(1), we get a direct sum
decomposition

(Z2g)  Z = 2g  (Z2g)  Z =

() 2g  D , Z(2(g1))  Z(1) =

2g  D . (5.33)





where the direct sum is over I-fusion trees . Next, insert this into the definition of C(Z)g
and use C(Z)g = C(Z(1)) as in the proof of Lemma 5.13. Comparing linearly independent
terms gives

() = 1

(5.34)

for any (1; (i1, i1 . . . , ig, ig).)-fusion tree .

Using Lemma 5.15, one can deduce from the fusion tree

f1 = 1. Let k  Ig and i  Iad be such that Nikkg = 0 and define

fk = ikkg fkg .

(5.39)

This is independent of the choice of i by Lemma 5.16 and is consistent with k = kg as

ikg kg

Remark 5.19. The proof of Lemma 5.18 above is the place where the maximal genus g occurs for which we use irreducibility of VgC, namely g = 3N + 2.

The conditions on ikj achieved up to this point are preserved by renormalisation constants fi which satisfy (5.20) as well as

fi = 1 for all i  Iad , fi = fj whenever i, j  Ig for some g .

(5.44)

Final Step

To conclude the proof, we will use group cohomology for the universal grading group G.
Namely, we define a 2-cochain  : G × G  k× as follows. Given g, h  G, pick bi  Rg,
bj  Rh as well as a bk  Rgh that appears in the product bibj. Then Nijk = 0 and we set

(g, h) := ikj .

(5.45)

By Lemma 5.18, this is independent of the choice of i, j, k.

Lemma 5.20. The 2-cochain  is a symmetric normalised 2-cocycle.

Proof. That  is normalised, i.e. that (e, g) = 1 = (g, e), is just the normalisation condition 1i i = 1 = 1i i achieved in step 1. Symmetry of , that is (g, h) = (h, g) follows from the commutativity property of ikj in Lemma 5.11.
To show the cocycle condition we will use coassociativity of the algebra Z. Given
f, g, h  G, pick bi  Rf , bj  Rg, and bk  Rh. Then choose l  I such that bl is a summand in the product bibjbk. This implies that bl  Rfgh.
In terms of structure constants, one side of the coassociativity condition for Z can be
rewritten as

(ri  rj  rk)  (Z  id)  Z  el

26

(=1)

(ri  rj  rk)  (Z  id)  ((ep  rp)  id)  Z  el

pI

(=2)

ipj pl k (ri  rj  rk)  (Z(1)  id)  ((ep  rp)  id)  Z(1)  el

pI

(=3) (f, g) (f g, h) (ri  rj  rk)  (Z(1)  id)  ((ep  rp)  id)  Z(1)  el

pI

(=4) (f, g) (f g, h) (ri  rj  rk)  (Z(1)  id)  Z(1)  el

(5.46)

In step 1 we expanded idZ into a direct sum over its component simple summands. This allows us in step 2 to insert the factors of  which give the difference between Z and Z(1) in each simple summand. (In this expression we take 's to be zero if their indices are not allowed by fusion.) The key step is equality 3. Here one uses that by the properties of the universal grading group, all p  I which give a nonzero contribution must have bp  Rfg, for else Nijp = 0. Thus, if we replace  by  via (5.45), the prefactor becomes independent of p and can be taking out of the sum. The sum over p can then be carried out giving the result of step 4.
An analogous computation for the other side of the coassociativity condition for Z gives

(ri  rj  rk)  (id Z)  Z  el = (g, h) (f, gh) (ri  rj  rk)  (id Z(1))  Z(1)  el .

(5.47)

Comparing the two expressions and using coassociativity of Z and Z(1) results in

(f, g) (f g, h) = (g, h) (f, gh) ,

(5.48)

which is the cocycle condition.

In group cohomology there is a short exact sequence

0  Ext(G, k×)  H2(G, k×)  Hom(2G, k×)  0 ,

(5.49)

see [Br, Exercise V.6.5]. However, Ext(G, k×) = 0 (as k is algebraically closed, k× is a

divisible group, and so injective as an abelian group). The second map in (5.49) is given

by

(g, h)

 - g  h 

,

(h, g)

(5.50)

and so any symmetric 2-cocycle is a coboundary.
In particular, by Lemma 5.20  is a coboundary, that is, there exist g  k× such that

(g, h) = g h . gh

(5.51)

As  is normalised, we have e = 1. Now choose fi = g-1 whenever i  Ig. This choice satisfies the conditions in (5.44). To see that also (5.20) holds, note that fifi =

27

(gg-1)-1 = (g, g-1)-1. But by (5.45) we have (g, g-1) = 1ii = 1, by step 1. This

finally gives

ikj

=

fk . fi fj

(5.52)

We have now completed the proof that Z(A) = Z(1) as algebras and thereby the proof of

Theorem 5.1.

A. Dimension of a simple non-degenerate algebra

A pivotal category is spherical if its left and right traces are equal. A ribbon category is automatically spherical. A multifusion category is the same as a fusion category, except that the tensor unit is not required to be simple. We refer to [EGNO, Ch. 4] for more details.
The following more general statement implies part 3 of Lemma 3.1.

Lemma A.1. Let F be a spherical multifusion category over an algebraically closed field
k (of any characteristic) and let A  F be a simple -separable symmetric Frobenius
algebra. Then dimF (A) = 0.
Proof. To avoid cumbersome notation, in this proof we assume F to be strict. Let Atop :=
F(1, A) denote the topological algebra of A, cf. [FRS, Sec. 3.4]. It is an algebra over k via
the product and unit

µtop(x, y) := µ  (x  y) , 1top :=  .

(A.1)

Define a pairing on Atop by

x, y :=   µtop(x, y) .

(A.2)

Let x = 0 be an element in Atop. The non-degeneracy of A (cf. Remark 3.2) implies that
  x = 0. Since F is semisimple, there is a  : A  1 such that     x = 0. Using the
expression in (3.2) for , it follows for y = 1 -c-oe-vA A  A -i-dA-- A that

x, y =     x = 0 .

(A.3)

Therefore, the pairing on Atop is non-degenerate. Consider now the linear map p : Atop  Atop defined by

p(x) = x .

(A.4)

28

Since A is -separable, it follows that p2 = p and p() = . The pairing satisfies the following invariance property:

p(x), y (=1)

x

(=2)

x

y

(=3) x, p(y) ,

(A.5)

y

where (1) uses the associativity of A, (2) is immediate from sphericality of F and (3) can be verified using that A is a symmetric Frobenius algebra.
Write AFA(A, A) for the subspace of A-A-bimodule morphisms in F (A, A). Consider the linear map  : AFA(A, A)  Atop given by (f ) := f  . It satisfies

(f ) = f   = f  p() = p(f  ) = p((f )) ,

(A.6)

where we used that f is a bimodule morphism to exchange p with f . Hence, we have Im()  Im(p). Conversely, let x  Atop and define fx  F (A, A) by

fx =

x

.

(A.7)

One checks that fx  AFA(A, A) and (fx) = p(x), so that Im(p)  Im(), i.e. altogether
Im(p) = Im().
Since the algebra A is simple, AFA(A, A) = k id (this uses that k is algebraically closed). Therefore, dim Im(p)  1 and so in fact we have Im(p) = k. By non-degeneracy of the
pairing in (A.2) we can find some y such that , y = 0. As  is a basis for Im(p) there is
  k with p(y) =  . Using this, we compute

0 = , y = p(), y = , p(y) =  ,  .

(A.8)

Therefore ,  = 0. Finally, dimF (A) =    = ,  = 0.
The condition that A is symmetric cannot be dropped from Lemma A.1. For example, the two-dimensional Clifford algebra with one odd generator in SV ect is simple -separable Frobenius (but not symmetric) and has dimension zero.
