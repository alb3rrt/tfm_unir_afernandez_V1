Abstract
We analyze families of primal high-order hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods for solving degenerate (second-order) elliptic problems. One major trouble regarding this class of PDEs concerns its mathematical nature, which may be nonuniform over the domain. Due to the local degeneracy of the diffusion term, it can be purely hyperbolic in a subregion and elliptic in the rest. This problem is thus quite delicate to solve since the exact solution is discontinuous at interfaces separating both elliptic and hyperbolic parts. The proposed HDG method is developed in a unified and compact fashion. It can efficiently handle pure diffusive or advective regimes and intermediate regimes that combine the above mechanisms for a wide range of P´eclet numbers, including the delicate situation of local evanescent diffusion. To this end, an adaptive stabilization strategy based on addition of jump-penalty terms is then considered. A -upwind-based scheme is favored for the hyperbolic region, and an inspired Scharfetter­Gummel-based technique is preferred for the elliptic region. The wellposedness of the HDG method is also discussed by analyzing the consistency and discrete coercivity properties. Extensive numerical experiments are finally considered to verify the model's robustness for all the abovementioned regimes.

1. Introduction
Degenerate second-order elliptic equations are well-established models to describe a wide variety of phenomena in real-life applications, such as pure diffusion or advection problems, and mixed problems combining the above mechanisms for a wide range of P´eclet numbers [24]. A detrimental situation may arise in the context of locally evanescent diffusivity. Indeed, its mathematical nature is nonuniform over the entire domain, as it can be purely hyperbolic in a subregion and elliptic in the rest. Consequently, the state variable can be discontinuous at interfaces separating both subregions according to the wind flow sense [9, 10, 14]. This critical

situation is easily encountered in the context of mass transport in fractured porous media. It is well known that fractures deeply affect the transport phenomena since they represent the preferential fluid flow paths. The large variability of the velocity's magnitude indicates that the advection mechanism is predominant in the fractures as compared with the rest of the domain. During recent decades, different authors have analyzed this model problem, although mainly in the context of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods (see, e.g., [10, 14, 17] and the extensive references therein). The success story of DG methods is because they combine advantages of finite volume and finite element methods, and they are well-suited to capture large gradients or discontinuities of exact solutions [25]. Despite all of these advantages, DG methods are generally more expensive than most other numerical methods due to their high number of coupled degrees of freedom (DOFs) and their large stencils. It is in this context that the HDG methods were initially devised: as a way to circumvent these drawbacks.
The HDG methods were first introduced by Cockburn et al. in [7] and have been applied successfully to various physical problems [4, 8, 12, 22, 21, 20, 23, 19]. They can be considered as a new class of DG methods that are eligible for static condensation. For that application, an additional discrete variable is introduced corresponding to the trace approximation of the state variable on the mesh skeleton. Thus, the interior-based DOFs can be easily eliminated by solving a local problem at the element level so that only skeleton-based DOFs remain. The problem is then closed by (weakly) imposing transmission conditions on the mesh skeleton, leading to a smaller and sparser final matrix system. In practice, DG methods and their HDG counterparts do not coincide because the latter use a richer definition of numerical traces. Consequently, HDG methods turn out to be more accurate than their predecessors in many situations, and they are thus more efficiently implementable and highly parallelizable [15, 18]. Despite all of these assets, the literature is relatively scarce concerning the resolution of degenerate elliptic equations by the class of HDG methods, which is the purpose of the present work. To the best of our knowledge, only Di Pietro et al. recently designed a primal discontinuous skeletal method based on the hybrid-high order (HHO) formalism for the diffusive part to address this kind of issue [9, 11].
In the present paper, we focus instead on the class of interior penalty HDG methods denoted by H-IP and its three well-known variants, namely, the incomplete (H-IIP), symmetric (H-SIP), and nonsymmetric (H-NIP) schemes [16, 28]. Indeed, the families of interior penalty methods are well-suited for solving degenerate elliptic equations since the diffusion term might not be invertible at every point of the domain; i.e., they belong to the class of -methods. For this aim, both diffusive and advective-reactive contributions are discretized separately. The stability of these contributions is ensured by adding jump-penalty terms, which correspond to the discrepancy between interior- and interface-based DOFs, on the mesh skeleton. The stabilization penalty parameters are selected in accordance with the nature of the local cellwise problem reducing to an upwinding-based scheme in the hyperbolic subregion [3] and the Scharfetter­Gummel (SG) scheme elsewhere [2, 9]. Thus, the stated H-IP formalism can treat in an automatic fashion the pure diffusion or advection-reaction processes or (mixed) advection-diffusion-reaction processes characterized by a diffusion- or advection-dominated regime, i.e., a wide range of P´eclet numbers - including the delicate situation of local evanescent diffusion. A stability analysis is then investigated by establishing the consistency and discrete coercivity properties. Numerical experiments are also presented to prove the following assertions, such as the high-order accuracy and robustness of the discretization method.
The material is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the homogeneous Dirichlet

boundary value problem in the sense of Fichera [24] by introducing some specific notations, and we precisely define the corresponding discrete setting in Section 3. In Section 4, we derive the discrete bilinear and linear operators of the discretization method, briefly discuss the static condensation and stability analysis, and precisely delineate the stabilization strategy. In Section 5, extensive numerical experiments are investigated using h- and p-refinement strategies for all abovementioned regimes. We end with some concluding remarks and perspectives.

2. Boundary value problem

We consider the stationary linear advection-diffusion-reaction model problem in its con-

servative form,

 · (-u + u) + u = f in ,

(1)

where   Rd is a bounded polyhedral domain (d  2) with boundary   Rd-1. The boldface fonts are used throughout the paper to characterize any vector- or matrix-valued functions. In the physical context of contaminant transport in a porous media,  :   Rd,d represents an anisotropic heterogeneous dispersion tensor, which is itself a function of the Darcy velocity field  :   Rd,  :   R+, the reaction coefficient, and f :   R, a forcing term. We then assume that the constitutive coefficients of (1) satisfy the following
minimal regularity requirements:

   [L()]d,d is a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix-valued function verifying

that

a.e.

(2)

where ¯    0 denote the largest and smallest eigenvalues of , respectively. Under the hypothesis (2), we shall assume the existence of a subdomain ell (resp. hyp)
corresponding to the elliptic (resp. hyperbolic) region such that

ell := {x   : t(x) > 0,   Rd}, hyp := {x   : t(x) = 0,   Rd},

(3)

verifying that  = ell  hyp and ell  hyp =  (nonoverlapping subregions).    [L()]d is s.t.  ·   L(),    L() verifying that the following standard coercivity condition holds

(4)

Let us now introduce the following disjoint boundary sets as defined by Oleinik and Radkevic [24] (see, e.g., Di Pietro et al. [9] and references therein);

- := {x   : nt(x)n > 0 or  · n < 0},

+ := {x   : nt(x)n = 0 and  · n  0},

(5)

where n denotes the unit outward normal to . Thus, the disjoint subsets ± will be referred
to as the nondegenerate inflow and degenerate outflow/no-flow parts of the boundary , respectively, verifying that  = -  + and -  + = . For clarity of our exposition,

3

we supplement the partial differential equation (1) with the following homogeneous Dirichlet

boundary conditions, namely,

u = 0 on -.

(6)

Let us remark that the Dirichlet boundary conditions are only prescribed for portions of  touching the elliptic region or the hyperbolic region, provided that the advective field flows into the domain. Let us now summarize some physical situations commonly encountered in the literature for which Dirichlet boundary conditions (6) adapt automatically:

Nondegenerate problems. Here,  is assumed to be a symmetric positive definite matrixvalued function on the whole domain . Hence, ell =  and the Dirichlet boundary condition is automatically enforced for the whole boundary - = . This situation includes the pure diffusive regime as well as the mixed advective-diffusive regime. Here, the weak solution u of the problem (1) respects some regularity requirements i.e., u  H1(), but it may present some sharp fronts along the characteristic direction , particularly for the advective-dominated regime.
Fully degenerate problems. Here, ell =  and we recover the standard advectionreaction problem defined in hyp respecting the coercivity condition (4) and the usual definition of the inflow - or outflow + parts of the boundary . Following these assumptions, the problem is well-posed with no smoothing properties i.e., u  L2(), and discontinuities in the solution u induced by f will propagate along the flow field , giving rise to internal layers.
Locally degenerate problems. We assume that both hyp and ell are nonempty subsets. The model problem is then purely hyperbolic in hyp and elliptic in the rest. Thus, we now define the common interface I := {x   : hyp  ell}. We emphasize that such problems are particularly delicate to solve since the solution can be discontinuous at the portion I- := {x  I : (x) · nI < 0}, where nI is an (arbitrary) oriented unit normal vector pointing out of the elliptic region. Concretely, I- corresponds to a subset of I where the advection field flows from the hyperbolic side to the elliptic side. Thus, we set I+ := I\I-.
For a given forcing term f  L2(), the continuous problem reads:

 · (-u + u) + u = f in ,

[[u]] = 0 on I+,

(7)

u = 0 on -,

where [[·]] denotes the standard DG-jump trace operator as defined in [1]. The well-posedness of the boundary value problem (7) has been analyzed by Oleinik and Radkevic in [24]. They proved the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution for homogeneous and nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, respectively. The main objective of the present paper is to propose, in a unified formalism, an inspired interior penalty HDG method that can treat all of these abovementioned physical situations in an automated fashion. Before doing so, let us specify the discrete setting concerning mesh assumptions, the definition of trace operators and the approximation spaces that will be used later in the rest of this paper.

3. Discrete setting

3.1. Mesh notations
Let h be a positive parameter, and assume without loss of generality that h  1. We denote by Thell (resp. Thhyp) a conformal partition of the subdomain ell (resp. hyp) satisfying Thell  Thhyp = . The set of all mesh elements is denoted by Th, i.e., Th := Thell  Thhyp, where h stands for the largest diameter of all elements. We precisely state here that the sets of mesh elements Thell and Thhyp can be composed of several types of geometric elements, i.e., hybrid meshes. Following our notation, the generic term interface indicates a (d - 1)-dimensional
geometric object with a positive measure, i.e., an edge if d = 2 and a face if d = 3. The set of boundary interfaces is denoted by Fhb, i.e., F  Fhb if there exists E in Th such that F := E  . We assume that the set Fhb coincides with the disjoint boundary partition Fhb±, i.e., the boundary interfaces lying entirely in one of the subsets ±. Likewise, we denote by Fhi the set of interior interfaces, i.e., F  Fhi if there exists E1 and E2 in Th such that F := E1  E2. The set of all interfaces is denoted by Fh, i.e., Fh := Fhi  Fhb, and we set Fh± := Fhi  Fhb±. In particular, we denote by Ih the subset of Fhi , which belongs to I (Ih  Fhi ), i.e., Ih corresponds here to the discrete counterpart of I. We assume first that for any interface F  Ih (i) there exist E1  Thell and E2  Thhyp such that F := E1 E2, and (ii) F lies entirely in one of the disjoint subsets Ih± corresponding to the discrete counterpart of I±, respectively. Moreover, for any mesh element E  Th, we denote by FE := {F  Fh : F  E} the set of interfaces composing the boundary of E, and we set E := card(FE). For all elements X of Th or Fh, we denote by |X| and hX the measure and diameter of X, respectively.
3.2. Approximation spaces
For any polyhedral domain D  Rd with D  Rd-1, we denote by (·, ·)0,D (resp. ·, · 0,D) the L2-inner product in L2(D) (resp. L2(D)) equipped with its natural norm · 0,D (resp.
· 0,D). Similarly, we denote by Hs(D) the usual Hilbert space of index s on D equipped with its natural norm · s,D and seminorm | · |s,D, respectively. In particular, if s = 0, then we set H0(D) = L2(D). We now denote by Hs(Th) the usual broken Sobolev space and by h the broken gradient operator acting on Hs(Th) with s  1. Let us now introduce compact notation associated with the discrete L2-inner scalar product:

(·, ·)0,Th :=

(·, ·)0,E , ·, · 0,Th :=

·, · 0,E and ·, · 0,Fh :=

·, · 0,F, (8)

ETh

ETh

FFh

and we denote by · 0,Th, · 0,Th and · 0,Fh its corresponding norms, respectively. As usual in HDG methods, we consider broken Sobolev spaces:

Pk(Th) := {vh  L2(Th) : vh|E  Pk(E), E  Th},

(9)

and similarly for Pk(Fh). Here, Pk(X) denotes the space of polynomials of at least degree k on X, where X corresponds to a generic element of Th or Fh, respectively. For H-IP discretization, two types of discrete variables are necessary to approximate the weak solution
u of problem (7). First, the discrete variable uh  Vh is defined within each mesh element, and its trace u^h  V^h0 is defined on the mesh skeleton with respect to the imposed Dirichlet boundary conditions at the boundary part -. Thus, we set:

Vh := Pk(Th) and V^h0 := {v^h  Pk(Fh) : v^h|F = 0, F  Fhb-}.

(10)

5

For clarity, we introduce compact discrete variables uh := (uh, u^h) and vh := (vh, v^h) belonging to the composite approximation space Vh := Vh × V^h0, i.e., uh, vh  Vh. Finally, let us
retain the discrete trace inequalities. For all vh  Vh, the following holds,

vh 0,F  Ctrh-E1/2 vh 0,E ,

(11)

where Ctr is a positive constant independent of hE.

3.3. Discrete trace operators

Let [[·]] denote the standard DG-jump operator as introduced by Brezzi et al. in [3]. For
all E  Th and F  E, we now define the HDG-jump operator of the composite discrete variable vh  Vh across F as [[[vh]]]E,F := (vh|F - v^h|F)nE,F, where nE,F denotes the unit normal vector to F pointing out of E. To ensure that confusion cannot arise, we voluntary
omit the subscripts E and F from the definition, and we simply write [[[vh]]] := (vh - v^h)n. Finally, we define the weighted-average operator denoted {{·}} and its conjugate {{·}}. For all F  Fhi with F := E1  E2 and v  Hs(Th) with s  1, we set:

{{v}} := 1v1 + 2v2 and {{v}} := 2v1 + 1v2,

(12)

where vi = v|Ei,F and  := (1, 2) is a double-valued function verifying that weights satisfy 1 + 2 = 1. If F  Fhb, we then assume that {{v}} = {{v}} := v. If  = (1/2, 1/2), we then recover the classical average operator, and we will omit the subscript  in their definitions.
These definitions (12) are also available for any vector-valued function v.

4. Hybridizable interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method
In this section, we describe the primal HDG method for solving the problem (7). First, we derive it intuitively, and we then propose a compact notation of all of these variants. The consistency and coercivity properties are also discussed in order to ensure the well-posedness of the discrete problem. Finally, we suggest an adaptive strategy for selecting suited penalty parameters with respect to the coercivity requirement for all mentioned regimes.

4.1. Intuitive derivation The discrete formulation of the continuous model problem (7) can be intuitively derived
with respect to the three following steps:

Global weak formulation: Let uh, vh  Vh. For all E  Th, multiplying (1) by a test function vh, and integrating by parts over E, we obtain a local equation:

-(h(uh), hvh)0,E + ^ h(uh) · n, vh 0,E + (µuh, vh)0,E = (f, vh)0,E , (13)

where h(uh) := -huh + uh corresponds to the approximation of the total flux on E and ^ h(uh), its trace approximation on E that we will precisely define below. By summing (13) over all elements E of Th, we then obtain the global equation,

-(h(uh), hvh)0,Th + ^ h(uh) · n, vh 0,Th + (µuh, vh)0,Th = (f, vh)0,Th .

(14)

Let us precisely state at this stage that ^ h(uh) can be evaluated independently on both sides of a given interface. Consequently, an additional equation needs to be included in (14) to ensure the continuity requirements.

6

Transmission conditions: By considering that v^h  V^h0 vanishes on Fhb-, we impose the global transmission requirements respecting the outflow boundary condition on Fhb+:

^ h(uh) · n, v^h 0,Th = ( · n)u^h, v^h 0,Fhb+ ,

(15)

which is the statement of weak continuity of ^ h(uh) · n across the mesh skeleton Fh+. Thus, substituting (15) into (14) leads to

-(h(uh), hvh)0,Th +(µuh, vh)0,Th + ^ h(uh), [[[vh]]] 0,Th + (·n)u^h, v^h 0,Fhb+ = (f, vh)0,Th . (16)

Numerical Flux in the HDG sense: The discrete problem (16) is then closed by setting ^ h(uh) at the element level. For all E  Th, we assume the following simple form:

^ h(uh) := h(uh) +  [[[uh]]] on E,

(17)

where  denotes the stabilization penalty parameter that we describe precisely below.

Inserting (17) into (16) leads to the incomplete scheme of the hybridizable interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (H-IIP) method. Several variations of this methodology can then be derived by controlling the introduction of additional consistent terms to the discrete formulation (16) that we have summarized below.

4.2. Compact discrete formulation Thus, the compact formulation of the H-IP method consists of seeking uh  Vh such that

a(h )(uh, vh) = l(vh),

vh  Vh,

(18)

where l(vh) := (f, vh)0,Th and the bilinear form a(h ) can be linearly decomposed following its diffusive, advective-reactive, and stability contributions, respectively:

a(h )(uh, vh) := a(,)h(uh, vh) + a,µ,h(uh, vh) + sh(uh, vh).

(19)

Here, a(,)h corresponds solely to the H-IP discretization of the diffusive part and is given by:

a(,)h(uh, vh) := (huh, hvh)0,Th - huh, [[[vh]]] 0,Th - hvh, [[[uh]]] 0,Th , (20)
where the parameter  {0, ±1} controls the introduction of the (consistent) symmetry term hvh, [[[uh]]] 0,Th. Similar to the standard IPDG methods, = 0 corresponds to the Incomplete scheme denoted as the H-IIP method as described above, while = +1 (resp.
= -1) denotes the Symmetric (resp. Nonsymmetric) scheme denoted as the H-SIP (resp. H-NIP) method. Thus, the advective-reactive part is discretized as follows:

a,µ,h(uh, vh) := -(uh, hvh)0,Th + (µuh, vh)0,Th + uh, [[[vh]]] 0,Th + ( · n)u^h, v^h 0,Fhb+ . (21)

The last quantity sh in (19) is called the discrete stability form based on jump-penalty terms and is given by:

sh(uh, vh) :=  [[[uh]]], [[[vh]]] 0,Th,

(22)

7

where  denotes the total stabilization function accounting for both the diffusive and advective normal effects denoted by  and , respectively; i.e.,  :=  (, ). Concretely,  (resp. ) corresponds to an arbitrary given definition of the penalty parameter in the context of a pure-diffusive (resp. -advective) regime. Let us also precisely state that  and , and hence  can be distinctively evaluated on both sides of an interface of the mesh skeleton. Different formulations have been proposed in the literature, and its definition is concretely prescribed regarding the predominant normal effect. In what follows, we shall assume some properties and minimal requirements concerning the function  :

Proposition 4.1. The stabilization function  : R × R  R (22) is chosen such that: 1. For all s, t  R, the following holds:

s :=  (s, 0) and t :=  (0, t).

(23)

The first assumption (23) allows for an encompassed treatment of both (extremal) con-

figurations, i.e., the pure-diffusive and pure-advective regimes characterized by  := 0 and  := 0, respectively. 2. We shall assume the existence of a constant 0 > 0 such that, for all s, t  R, then

·n

min( (s, t) -  (s, 0) + 2 )|Th  0

(24)

The second assumption ensures the coercivity and hence the well-posedness of the discrete

problem (18) (see Lemma 4.3.2).

Definition 4.1 (Diffusive penalty parameter). For all E  Th and F  FE, we assume that the diffusive parameter |E,F has the following form,

|E,F

:=

0

Ct2r

E,F hE

on F  E,

(25)

where E,F := nE,FEnE,F corresponds to the normal diffusivity, 0 > 0 is a user-dependent parameter, and Ctr is the constant of the discrete trace inequality (11).

Remark 4.1 (Static condensation). As mentioned in [4] (see, e.g., [5]), the technique of
static condensation was introduced to reduce the size of the discrete matrix associated with the global problem (18). Indeed, let Uh := [Uh, U^ h] denote the vector of DOFs of the composite variable uh  Vh, which is composed of interior- and interface-based DOFs denoted by Uh and U^ h, respectively. The strategy consists of eliminating interior-based unknowns from the above equations by successively projecting (18) on (vh, 0) and (0, v^h). We thus obtain

a(h )(uh, (vh, 0)) : AuuUh + Auu^U^ h = F, a(h )(uh, (0, v^h)) : Au^uUh + Au^u^U^ h = 0.

(26)

Due to the discontinuous nature of Vh, all computations can be performed cellwise, leading to

a block-diagonal matrix Auu, which can be easily inverted and eliminated. Finally, we obtain

the linear system:

[Au^u^ - Au^uA-uu1Auu^]U^ h = G.

(27)

The matrix on the left-hand-side of (27) is called the Shur complement of Auu. Let us precisely state that the original discrete problem (18) and its reduced version (27) are globally nonsymmetric since the continuous problem (26) is itself nonsymmetric: this is due to the advective term.

4.3. Stability analysis We now must check some favorable properties such as the consistency and stability of all
-variants of the H-IP method to ensure the existence and uniqueness of a discrete solution.

4.3.1. Consistency Lemma 4.1 (Consistency). Let u be the exact solution of the problem (7) and u^ denote its trace on the mesh skeleton. By setting u := (u, u^), the following holds

a(h )(u, vh) = l(vh),

vh  Vh,

(28)

for any value of the parameter = {0, ±1}.

Proof. The regularity of u implies that its jump (in the HDG sense) is null on Th, i.e., for all E  Th and F  FE, and then [[[u]]] := 0, since u is a single-valued field on F  FE. Thus, by setting vh := (vh, 0), integrating by parts on each element of the mesh, and finally observing
that [[-hu + u]] := 0 on internal interfaces, we immediately have

a(h )(u, (vh, 0)) :=

(h · (-hu + u) + µu, vh) =

(f, vh).

(29)

ETh

Considering now that vh := (0, v^h)  Vh, we then obtain

a(h )(u, (0, v^h)) := -

(-hu + u) · n, v^h 0,A + ( · n)u, v^h Fhb+ = 0, (30)

ETh

which corresponds to the (imposed) transmission conditions. The proof is then completed by summing (29) and (30).

4.3.2. Coercivity
Let us now introduce the natural energy-norm ||| · ||| equipping Vh. For all vh  Vh, it is thus given by

|||vh|||2 :=

1/2hvh

2 0,Th

µ10/2vh

(31)

which clearly depends on constitutive coefficients ,  :=  · n, and parameters µ0 and 0 as given in (4) and (24), respectively. Here, | · | corresponds to the HDG-jump seminorm, which is defined as follows:

|vh|2 :=

|vh|2,E with |vh|2,E :=

E1/,2F [[[vh]]]

2 0,F

,

ETh

FFE

(32)

where E,F  0 is an arbitrary positive constant associated with F  FE. The norm (31) is well-defined owing to assumptions (4) and (24). To prove the coercivity, let us now introduce the following intermediate result, which is a minor adaptation to the -tensor field of the proof given by Wells in [28]:

The proof is then completed by applying Young's inequality for any  > 0 and summing over all mesh elements.

Lemma 4.3 (Coercivity). For any value of the parameter := {0, ±1}, there exists a positive constant C independent of h such that

a(h )(vh, vh)  C|||vh|||2.

(37)

Proof. Setting uh = vh in discrete bilinear forms a(,)h (20) and sh (22), we immediately obtain that:

Remark 4.2. A straightforward consequence of the consistency and coercivity requirements via the Lax­Milgram Theorem is the well-posedness of (18); i.e., the existence and uniqueness of the discrete solution uh  Vh are ensured.

4.4. Adaptive stabilization strategy
In practice, the choice of  is quite delicate, as it strongly affects the accuracy of the HDG
method (18). Indeed, its definition directly impacts the numerical flux approximations on interfaces F  Fh+. To prove its relevance, let us apply a continuity argument, i.e., [[^ h(uh)]] = 0, on an interior interface F := E1  E2. We immediately deduce that (u^h, ^ h) can be expressed only in terms of the discrete variables (uh, h) on both sides of F,

u^h = {{uh}} + [[h]], ^ h = {{h}} + [[uh]],

(43a) (43b)

where h := -huh + uh, and the parameters ,  and  are given below by:

for any given finite value i := Ei,F of the total penalty parameter. To derive a suitable analytical expression of  , we now treat both hyperbolic and elliptic regimes distinctively.

4.4.1. Hyperbolic regime
We assume here that  := 0, and hence  :=  by virtue of (23). To ensure the minimal requirement (24) in the context of the hyperbolic regime, the advective penalty parameter must be chosen such that  > | · n| /2 on the mesh skeleton. Furthermore, it is well known that an arbitrary choice of the stability parameter  can be detrimental in the context of pure-advective problems: discontinuities in the boundary data may trigger large spurious oscillations in the numerical solution. However, these drawbacks can be easily circumvented by adopting an upwind-based strategy. To this aim, we now consider the following definition of the advective penalty parameter:
Definition 4.2 (-upwind penalty). For all E  Thhyp and F  E, we assume the following definition of the advective stabilization penalty parameter:

E,F :=  | · nE,F | on F  E,

(45)

where  > 1/2 in order to ensure Proposition 4.1.

11

Following from the regularity of the Darcy field , i.e., [[]] = 0, we infer that the advective penalty parameter as defined in (45) is single-valued on interior interfaces of the hyperbolic region. Let us now introduce the signum function, which is given as follows:

x

-1 if x < 0, 

sgn(x) := = 0 if x = 0,

(46)

|x| +1 if x > 0.

Proposition 4.2 (-upwind fluxes). Following Definition 4.2, for all E1, E2  Thhyp and F := E1  E2, the corresponding numerical fluxes (u^h, ^ h) on F are given by


   

u^h

:=

{{uh}}

+

^ h

)

and

(

).

Proof. The proof is evident by substituting the definition (45) in (43), and assuming that  is null in Thhyp and that  is single-valued on the mesh skeleton.

Remark 4.3 (Traditional schemes). By appropriately selecting the value of  in (45), we can then establish bridges with some well-known stabilization schemes.

· Upwind-scheme: By setting  = 1, we can observe that 1 = 1, and we recover the standard definition of upwinding fluxes denoted by (u^uhp, ^ uhp),

u^uhp :=

ui {{uh}}

if if

 · ni > 0,  · ni = 0,

and ^ uhp := u^uhp.

(48)

The corresponding upwind penalty parameter is denoted up := | · n|.

· Centered-scheme: Assuming now   +, we then obtain the centered fluxes (u^ch, ^ ch),

u^ch

:=

lim {{uh
+

}}

=

{{uh}}

and

^ ch

:=

{{uh}}

+

 2

[[uh]].

(49)

However, this situation will be precluded in the rest of the paper as it consists of assigning an infinite value to the penalty parameter since  = lim+  = +. This choice significantly reduces the accuracy of the discrete solution since it converges to the discrete
solution produced by the standard conforming Galerkin method characterized by spurious
oscillations.

Remark 4.4 (Degenerate outflow boundaries). Let us finally precisely denote the transmission conditions at degenerative outflow boundaries that belong to the hyperbolic region. For all F  Fhb+, we impose that ^ h(uh) · n = ( · n)u^h, where ^ h(uh) := uh + [[[uh]]]. By combining these expressions, we observe that the role of  on outflow boundaries is clearly insignificant, since for any finite value of  > 0, we then obtain u^h := uh.
Thereafter, we shall assume that the advective stabilization penalty parameter  is chosen accordingly with the -upwind strategy described in Definition 4.2.

12

4.4.2. Elliptic regime
We assume here that the diffusion is not degenerate, i.e.,  > 0. To ensure the minimal requirement (24) in the context of the elliptic regime, the total penalty parameter is chosen such that    + | · n| /2. Let us now introduce the P´eclet number to locally characterize the regime of the physical process.

Definition 4.3. For all E  Thell and F  E, we define the local (oriented) P´eclet number

as follows:

PeE,F

:=



 · nE,F E,F

on F  E,

(50)

where  is a positive constant that we will precisely define below.

Concretely, the regime is considered as locally (i) diffusion-dominated if PeE,F  , and (ii) advection-dominated if PeE,F  +. Following the definition (50), we emphasize here that Pe can be distinctively evaluated on both sides of an interface F  Fhi . For all E  Thell and F  E, we now assume the following generic form of the (total) stabilization penalty

parameter i.e.,

E,F := E,F |A| (PeE,F ),

(51)

where |A| : R  R is a given function respecting the following minimal requirements:

(R1) |A| must be an even convex function, i.e., s  R then |A| (-s) = |A| (s) respecting
|A| (0) = 1. The latter condition allows recovery of the definition of the penalty term in the pure diffusive limit, i.e., if PeE,F = 0, then E,F := E,F . This is in accordance with the first assumption (23) as described in Proposition 4.1.

(R2) The function |A| must respect the following asymptotic behaviors:

|A| (s)

lim

= sgn(s),

(52)

|s| s

which is in accordance with the parity requirement (R1). It allows recovery of the upwinding-based strategy for purely hyperbolic problems, and consequently the definition of the corresponding fluxes (48) for the advection-dominated regime:

E,F

:=



· nE,F

lim |PeE,F |

|A| (PeE,F ) PeE,F

=

 |

· nE,F | .

(53)

This is in accordance with the second assumption (23) as described in Proposition 4.1.

(R3) There exists 0  R such that for all   0 and s  R, then the following holds:

|s|

|A| (s)  1 + ,

(54)

2

which is in accordance with the convexity requirement (R1). This argument is crucial to ensure that a(h ) is Vh-coercive.

Following the above hypotheses of |A|, we can recover some well-known stabilization strategies:

13

The Additive scheme: By setting |A|add (s) := 1 + |s|, we easily infer that

E,F := E,F (1 + PeE,F ) = E,F + E,F ,

(55)

where E,F :=  | · nE,F| corresponds to the advective stability parameter chosen in accordance with the -upwind strategy. Here, we assume that the total stability param-
eter is simply equal to the sum of its distinctive diffusive and advective contributions,
respectively. It is evident that |A|add respects all above criteria (R1-R3) assuming   1/2.

The Scharfetter­Gummel scheme: By setting |A|sg (s) := B(- |s|) where

s

 B(s) := es - 1

if

s = 0,

(56)

else.

denotes the (well-known) Bernoulli function. Let us notice that the following holds

|s|

1 +  B(- |s|)  1 + |s| , 2

s  R.

(57)

Thus, by using a scaling argument, we can easily infer that for all   R,

|A|add (s/2)  |A|sg (s)  |A|add (s), s  R,

(58)

proving immediately the last condition (R3) for any given   1. In practice, the SGscheme is particularly interesting since it introduces less artificial diffusion than the Add-scheme in the diffusion-dominated regime.

An illustration of both stabilization functions |A|add (s) and |A|sg (s) is given below in Figure 1 using different admissible values of .

5. Numerical results
To close this section, we provide some numerical experiments illustrating the robustness and accuracy of the proposed H-IP method for solving degenerate advection-diffusion-reaction model problems. For this aim, we next focus on three distinctive physical situations, namely, nondegenerate, fully degenerate and locally degenerate problems, respectively. All of our numerical experiments are performed using the high-performance finite element library called NGSolve [26], and all developed source codes are available for free download from the following Github repository1.

5.1. Nondegenerate problem
We assume here that both  and  are nonnull for the whole domain  := [0, 1]2. In this first example, as proposed by Egger and Sch¨oberl in [13], we illustrate the ability of the proposed H-IP formalism to deal (efficiently and automatically) with physical processes characterized by a large range of P´eclet numbers. Both the velocity field  and the dispersion matrix  are supposed to be constant on  ­ i.e.,  := (1, 2) with 1,2  R and  := I2, where Id denotes the identity matrix in Rd,d and  > 0. The exact solution is given by

u(x, y) = [x + (e1x/ - 1)/(1 - e1/)] · [y + (e2y/ - 1)/(1 - e2/)],

(59)

and the right-hand-side f is chosen such that the exact solution u is verified. For our numerical study, we then set  := (2, 1), and we select a large range of  := {5e - 1, 5e - 2, 5e - 3} to control the ratio between the diffusive and advective contributions. The exact solution u displays sharper fronts on the top and right boundaries of  as  becomes smaller. Since the diffusive part is nonnull inside , we can distinguish three variants of the H-IP method: the H-IIP, H-NIP and H-SIP schemes, respectively. Here, we analyze the influence of the stabilization strategy, namely, the Add- or SG-schemes as defined in Section 4.4.2, on the behavior of discrete solutions. For clarity of our exposition, we set  := 1. Standard h- and k-refinement strategies are used to compute the discrete L2-errors and estimated convergence rates (ECRs). A history of convergence of the three variants is presented in Table 1 for different values of  := {5e - 1, 5e - 2} and polynomial degrees k := {1, 2}, and for both Addand SG-schemes, respectively. First, a brief analysis indicates that the H-IIP and H-NIP schemes behave differently from the H-SIP scheme regardless of the stabilization function. Their convergence orders are (strongly) influenced by the polynomial parity of k. We observe that the convergence rate is suboptimal (with order k) only for even k, and optimal (with order k + 1) for odd k. The situation is somewhat different for the H-SIP method, since it always converges optimally for all k. These statements agree with the theoretical results established by Shin et al. in [27] (see e.g., [16] for the pure diffusive problem). To pursue our comparative analysis, we then illustrate in Figures 2b and 2d the spatial distribution of the computed L2-error on the whole domain for both Add- and SG-schemes. These illustrations indicate that the SG-scheme produces much less artificial diffusion error than the Add-scheme and hence captures sharp fronts much more effectively. Thus, we will favor the H-SIP variant coupled with the Scharfetter-Gummel scheme in elliptic regions in all future experiments.

5.2. Fully degenerate problem
In the second example, we analyze the behavior of the H-IP method in the context of hyperbolic problems. Let us notice that the discrete bilinear operator as defined in (18) is reduced to its advective-reactive part since  is null throughout the whole domain  = [0, 1]2. Thus, we set  := (2, 1),  := 1 and f := 0. The following exact solution is prescribed

u(x, y) = H(-x + 2y - 1) for all (x, y)  ,

(60)

where H(·) denotes the Heaviside function. Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed (only) for the degenerate inflow part - ­ i.e., the left and bottom boundaries of . The exact

solution displays a discontinuity along the characteristic direction  due to the jump in imposed boundary conditions at x = 0. We also assume that the actual location of internal layers is unknown, and an adaptive mesh refinement strategy is investigated to capture them. Let us precisely state that resulting meshes are (generally) not aligned with the characteristic direction . We analyze here the role of the upwind-parameter  (see e.g., Definition 4.2) with respect to the accuracy of discrete solutions for different polynomial degrees k := {1, 2}. Since the exact solution (60) is only piecewise constant, increasing polynomial degrees can only yield better discrete approximations near internal layers. Following Figure 3, let us notice first that the -upwind scheme effectively handles outflow boundary conditions for any selected value of : this observation agrees with Remark 4.4. However, the increase in  significantly deteriorates the discrete solution near the internal layer for all polynomial degrees

17

since there is more erratic behavior and/or a more considerable artificial numerical diffusion: this observation agrees with Remark 4.3. Thus, we will favor the traditional upwinding scheme obtained by selecting  = 1 in hyperbolic regions in all future experiments.

5.3. Locally degenerate problem

In the last example, we validated the proposed H-IP formalism in the context of lo-

cally degenerate diffusion. To achieve this aim, we consider a slight modification to the

test case proposed by Di Pietro et al. in [6] (see e.g., [9]). The domain is now taken to be

responding to the elliptic and hyperbolic parts, respectively (see e.g., Figure 4a). Denoting

by (r, ) the polar coordinates (with azimuth  measured in the anticlockwise sense starting

from the positive x-axis) and by e the (unit) azimuthal vector, the problem coefficients are

 if 0 <   ,  = 0 if  <   2,

and  := I2. As illustrated in Figure 4b, the exact solution is given by,

u(r, ) =

( - )2 if 0 <   , 3( - ) if    < 2.

(62)

and is used to infer the forcing term f and the imposed Dirichlet boundary datum. Here, we focus only on the H-SIP method using the Scharfetter­Gummel scheme in the elliptic region, and the H-IP method using the -upwind stabilization strategy in the hyperbolic one. For clarity of our exposition, we set  := 1 in both regions, but it is quite possible to fix distinctive values in each subdomain. Standard h- and k-refinement strategies are used to compute the discrete L2-errors and estimated convergence rates (ECRs). A history of convergence is illustrated in Figure 5a for different polynomial degrees k := {1, . . . , 5}. We observe that the convergence rate is optimal with order k + 1 for all k.

6. Conclusion & Perspectives
We have derived a compact interior penalty HDG method for solving degenerate advectiondiffusion-reaction problems. The proposed H-IP method can efficiently handle pure diffusive or advective regimes, along with intermediate regimes combining the above mechanisms for a wide range of P´eclet numbers, including the delicate situation of local evanescent diffusion. An adaptive stabilization strategy is carried out, automatically accounting for the mathematical nature of (7) and the predominance of the diffusion or advection mechanisms. An upwindingbased scheme was favored for the hyperbolic region, and an inspired Scharfetter­Gummel scheme was preferred for the elliptic region. One undeniable advantage of this strategy is the possibility of tuning the amount of upwind. The stability analysis indicates that all considered variants are consistent and coercive, ensuring the well-posedness of the discrete problem in all regimes. The flexibility and accuracy of the proposed method are confirmed by numerical lines of evidence.
