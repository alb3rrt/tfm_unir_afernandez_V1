## Abstract

The impact of magnetic domains in magnetic flux concentrators is studied using the simulation software MuMax3. First, the simulation parameters are validated using experimental results from magnetic force microscopy; second the simulation output is benchmarked with the one obtained using Comsol Multiphysics. Finally, the impact of magnetic domain is assessed, showing how micromagnetic effects can become relevant, if not dominant, when scaling the gap between the MFC and the sensor.
