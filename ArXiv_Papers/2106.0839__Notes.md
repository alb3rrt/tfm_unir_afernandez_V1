## Abstract

As machine learning algorithms start to get integrated into the decision-making process of companies and organizations, insurance products will be developed to protect their owners from risk. We introduce the concept of algorithmic insurance and present a quantitative framework to enable the pricing of the derived insurance contracts. We propose an optimization formulation to estimate the risk exposure and price for a binary classification model. Our approach outlines how properties of the model, such as accuracy, interpretability and generalizability, can influence the insurance contract evaluation. To showcase a practical implementation of the proposed framework, we present a case study of medical malpractice in the context of breast cancer detection. Our analysis focuses on measuring the effect of the model parameters on the expected financial loss and identifying the aspects of algorithmic performance that predominantly affect the price of the contract.
