## Abstract

We find that all (sub)categories have local preferences that decide internal and external patents' popularities. Different patents are popular in different groups: Groups C1, C2 and C3 may not agree on popular patents in C1. In general, patent popularity appears to be a highly local phenomenon with subcategories (not even categories) deciding their own popular patents independent of the other (sub)categories.
