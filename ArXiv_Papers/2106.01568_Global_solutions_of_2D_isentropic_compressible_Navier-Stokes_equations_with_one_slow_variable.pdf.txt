YONG LU AND PING ZHANG
Abstract. Motivated by [2, 3], we prove the global existence of solutions to the two-dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with smooth initial data which are slowly varying in one direction and with initial density being away from vacuum. In particular, we present examples of initial data which generate unique global smooth solutions to 2D compressible Navier-Stokes equations with constant viscosity and with initial data which are neither small perturbation of some constant equilibrium state nor of small energy.

1. Introduction

We investigate the global existence of smooth solutions to the following two-dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations describing the motion of viscous barotropic compressible flows:

(1.1)

t + div (u) = 0, (t, x, y)  R+ × T × R, t(u) + div (u  u) - µu -  µdiv u + p() = 0,

where (t, x, y)  R+ and u(t, x, y)  R2 designate the the density and the velocity field of the fluid respectively. Here the shear viscosity µ and bulk viscosity µ are assumed to be constant with µ > 0 and µ + µ > 0. The pressure function p is a smooth non-decreasing function of the density
. For simplicity, we just consider power law pressure with

(1.2)

p() = a, a > 0,   1.

and

lower values close to 1 is related to polyatomic gases at high temperature. In this paper, we allow

any   [1, 2]. One may check [19] for more background of the system (1.1).

The global existence of smooth solution to the multi-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes

equations is one of the most important problems in the theory which describes the motion of

the viscous compressible fluids. In [20], Matsumura and Nishida proved the global existence of

solutions to the full compressible Navier-Stokes equations when the initial data is close to a constant

equilibrium state in H3(Rn). Danchin [4] worked out similar result yet with initial data in certain

optimal function spaces. Huang, Li and Xin [12] established the global existence and uniqueness of

classical solutions to the Cauchy problem of the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations

in three space dimensions with smooth initial data which are of small energy but possibly large

oscillations. Concerning general smooth data without size restriction and with initial density being

away from vacuum, the first well-posedness result is due to Vaigant and Kazhikhov [30] where

the authors proved the global unique solution to the two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes

system (1.1) in R+ × T2 with the bulk viscosity µ = b and b > 0,  > 3. Lately this result was

improved

[13]

for

.

For

results

in

higher

dimensional

setting,

refer to [31, 1, 9] and the references therein.

On the other hand, Chemin and Gallagher [2] proved the global existence of smooth solution to three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (N S) with initial data which is slowly varying in one direction. This type of result was extended by Chemin and the second author [3] to the three-dimensional incompressible inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations and by Liu and the second author [17] for (N S) with unidirectional derivative of the initial velocity being sufficiently small in some critical functional space.
Motivated by [2, 3, 17], we are looking for global solutions of (1.1) that are periodic in x variable, and have slow variation in y variable. This means that we implement the system (1.1) with initial data of the form

(1.3)

(0, x, y) = [0](x, y), u(0, x, y) = [w0](x, y), [w0](x, y) ,

where (x, y)  T × R with T being the torus R/Z. Here and in all that follows, we shall always
denote [f ](x, y) d=ef f (x, y).

We aim at showing the global well-posedness of (1.1)­(1.3) without assuming any size restriction on (0, w0, w0) provided that  is sufficiently small. We remark that data of the form (1.3) are neither of small perturbation of some constant equilibrium state, say (1, 0), nor of small energy. Hence in particular, our result gives examples indicating that 2D compressible Navier-Stokes equations with constant viscosity might be globally well-posed even for general initial data with initial density being away from vacuum.
Formally with initial data given by (1.3), we may seek solution of (1.1) as follows

(t, x, y) = [](t, x, y), u(t, x, y) = [v](t, x, y),

then it follows from (1.1) that

(1.4)

t + div(v) = 0, t(v) + div(v  v) - µv - µdivv + p() = 0,

with initial data
Here (1.5)

(0, x, y) = 0(x, y), v(0, x, y) = w0(x, y), w0(x, y) .

 d=ef

x y

,

div d=ef  ·

and  d=ef x2 + 2y2.

Formally passing   0 in (1.4) leads to a limit system of the form with a parameter y :

(1.6) and

t + x(w) = 0, (t, x, y)  R+ × T × R, (tw + wxw) - x2w - xp() = 0 with  d=ef µ + µ,

(1.7)

(tw + wxw) - µx2w = 0,

Accordingly, the initial data are

(t, x, y)  R+ × T × R.

(1.8)

(0, x, y) = 0(x, y), w(0, x, y) = w0(x, y), w(0, x, y) = w0(x, y).

We observe that the equations of (, w) and the equation of w are decoupled. Furthermore, (, w) satisfies one dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations with a parameter y. We shall study in detail about this system in Section 3.
Before proceeding, we assume that

for some positive constants 0 and ¯0, and for j = 0, 1, 2. Here the subscript h (resp. v) denotes the norm on Tx (resp. Ry). We assume moreover that

0(x, y) dx = 1, (0w0)(x, y) dx = (0w0)(x, y) dx = 0,  y  R.

Our first result is concerned with the large time exponential decay for the solutions to the

equations (1.6) and (1.7) with initial data (1.8).

Theorem 1.1. Let (0, w0, w0) satisfy (1.9) and (1.10). Then for each y  R, the system (1.6)­(1.8) has a unique global-in-time strong solution (, w, w)  C([0, ); H2(T)) so that

  (t, x, y)  ¯, for some positive constants  and ¯.

Moreover, there exist positive constants C and  solely depending on (a, , , ¯0, 0, A¯4) such that for all t  R+ and y  R

We point out that to prove Theorem 1.1, it is crucial to establish the related estimates for (, w) in (1.12). Indeed with thus obtained estimates for (, w), those estimates for w follow immediately. The proof of Theorem 1.1 will be presented from Section 3 to Section 6.
The main result of this paper states as follows:

Theorem 1.2. Let (0, w0, w0) satisfy (1.9) and (1.10). Then (1.1)­(1.3) has a unique globalin-time strong solution (, u)  C([0, ); H2(T × R)). Furthermore, let (, w, w) be the global solution to (1.6­1.8) obtained in Theorem 1.1, we denote

(1.13)

 d=ef  - [] and R d=ef u - ([w], [w])T ,

and the energy functional

where  d=ef curlR = yR1 - xR2, DtR d=ef tR + u · R. Then there exists a constant C solely depending on (a, , µ, µ, ¯0, 0, A5 L1L(Ry)) such that

(1.15)

E() + 2()  C.

We remark that the main idea used to prove Theorem 1.2 is to approximate 2D compressible Navier-Stokes equations with a slow variable via 1D compressible Navier-Stokes equations with a parameter. This is inspired by the study in [2, 3] where 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a slow variable can be well approximated by 2D Navier-Stokes equations which is globally well-posed.

Let us end this section with some notations that we shall use throughout this paper. Notations: In the whole paper, we designate  d=ef T×R, QT d=ef (0, T )× and Q d=ef (0, +)×. We shall always denote C to be a uniform constant which may vary from line to line, and a b
means that a  Cb, and a  b means that both a  Cb and b  Ca hold. And we use subscript h
(resp. v) to denote the norm taken on Tx (resp. Ry).

2. Ideas and structure of the proof
In this section, we shall sketch the main ideas of the proof to Theorems 1.1 and 1.2. For each fixed y  R, the global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to 1D compressible Navier-Stokes equations (1.6) is well known (see for instance [14, 16, 24, 25, 26]). Although the results in the above references focus on domains either being the whole line R or being a bounded

GLOBAL SOLUTIONS OF 2D COMPRESSIBLE NAVIER-STOKES SYSTEM

interval, the well-posedness results can be easily modified to the torus T. More precisely, under the assumptions that

(2.1)

0 < 0  0  ¯0 < , 0 - 1  H1(T), w0  H1(T),

(1.6)­(1.8) has a unique global solution (, w) so that for each T > 0

(2.2)

0 < (T )    ¯(T ) < ,  - 1  C([0, T ]; H1(T)), t  C([0, T ]; L2(T)), w  C([0, T ]; H1(T)), w  L2(0, T ; H2(T)), and wt  L2(0, T ; L2(T)).

In general, the related estimates in (2.2) depend on the time interval [0, T ]. We shall show below that such estimates hold uniformly in time. Actually, we shall show exponential decay-intime estimates of the solutions. In the case when spatial domain is a bounded interval and with homogeneous boundary condition for w, Straskraba and Zlotnik [26] established exponential decayin-time estimate for the H1 norms of  - 1 and w. It is not obvious that the same exponential decay estimate holds for the case of torus uniformly in y  R. One difficulty lies in that, unlike the case in bounded domain with homogeneous boundary condition for w, we can not have a similar version of Poincar´e inequality on torus T. Another difficulty is due to the presence of the parameter y  R. We will have to show that the corresponding decay estimates are uniform with respect to y  R and (yj, yj w), j = 1, 2, share the same decay estimate. To achieve this, we need to show the density function  admits a uniform finite upper bound and a uniform positive lower bound with respect to y  R. In particular, in order to derive the uniform strictly positive lower bound, one needs to show that as time goes to infinity, the kinetic energy goes to zero and the integral of the pressure goes to a strictly positive number with a speed independent of y  R. The result in [26] can not be directly applied here. Instead, we shall first establish the uniform upper bound of the density by using the idea in [26]. Then we find that this is enough to derive the exponential decay for the basic energy, see Proposition 3.2. Since (yj, yj w), j = 1, 2, does not fulfill a typical 1D compressible Navier-Stokes system, there arise new difficulties in this procedure of deriving the exponential decay estimates for (yj, yj w), j = 1, 2. A further difficulty comes from the GagliardoNirenberg interpolation inequality in . Since  = T×R which is essentially bounded in x variable, thus the classical Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequality reads (p > 2):

flux in the proof of Lemma 2.3. So we need a modified version of Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation

inequality in  which always involves the term f L2(), which is Lemma 2.1 below.

In Section 3, we shall present the detailed decay-in-time estimates for solutions of (1.6)­(1.8).

Proposition 2.1. Under the assumptions of Theorem 1.1, (1.6)­(1.8) has a unique global solution (, w) and there exist positive constants , ¯, C and  solely depending on (a, , , ¯0, 0, A¯4) such that (1.11) and

hold for any t  R+ and y  R.

To avoid notational complexity, we shall denote E(y)  L1(R)  L(R) to a universal function, which is determined by the initial conditions. The positive constants C and  are also determined by the initial conditions. From now on, we shall not point out the precise dependence of E(y) and the constants C, , and we neglect the dependence on the y variable.

The proof of Proposition 2.2 will be presented in Section 4. While we shall outline the proof

of Propositions 2.3 and 2.4 in Sections 5 and 6 respectively. By combing Propositions 2.1-2.4, we

conclude the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Let (, w, w) be the unique global solution of (1.6)-(1.8), which has been constructed in Theorem

1.1. We define

(2.7)

a d=ef [], ua d=ef ([w], [w])T.

Then in view of (1.6) and (1.7), we have

(2.8)

ta + div (aua) = [(w)y], a(tua + ua · ua) - µua - µdiv ua + p(a) = -G,

where G = (G1,, G2,)T is given by

(2.9)

G1, d=ef -[wwy ] + µ2[wyy] + µ[wxy ], G2, d=ef -[wwy] + 2[wyy] + µ[wxy] - [p()y].

Then by virtue of (1.12), we deduce that

On the other hand, with initial data given by (1.3) and (0, w0, w0) satisfying (1.9) and (1.10), there exists a positive time T > 0 so that (1.1)­(1.3) has a unique solution (, u) on [0, T) and for any T < T,

(2.11)

0 < (T )    ¯(T ) < ,   C([0, T ]; H2()), t  C([0, T ]; H1()), u  C([0, T ]; H2())  L2(0, T ; H3()), tu  C([0, T ]; L2())  L2(0, T ; H1()).

One may check [21, 23] for details. Let T be the maximal existence time of (, u) so that (2.11) holds. We are going to prove
that T =  for  being sufficiently small. In order to do so, we define the remaining term

(2.12)

 d=ef  - a and R d=ef u - ua.

Recall that Dt d=ef t + u · . Then it follows from (1.1) and (2.8) that

(2.13)

It is easy to observe that for all t < T:

(2.15)

0 < /2    ¯ + /2 < .

We shall first derive the basic energy estimate for (, R) for t < T. A standard way to perform this estimate is to test the momentum type equation in (2.13) by R and using integration by parts.
A tricky term to handle is the one related to the pressure:

(2.16)

p() - p(a) div R dx dy.


Similar term p()div u appears in the renormalized formulation to the continuity equation of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations:

tP () + div (P ()u) + (P () - P ())div u = 0,

where P () is called the pressure potential, which is determined by

P () - P () = p().

As a result, it comes out

In particular, for our case p() = a with   1, the corresponding pressure potential is

P () d=ef a( log  + 1) if  = 1.

However, it is not clear at a first glance how to use such an argument to deal with the term (2.16). Here we shall employ the well-known relative entropy inequality to derive the basic energy estimate for  and R. Relative entropy inequality is widely used in the study of uniqueness and stability for Navier­Stokes equations and some related models, see [7, 10] for compressible Navier­ Stokes equations, [8] for compressible Navier­Stokes­Fourier equations, and [18] for a compressible Oldroyd model. The result states as follows:

Proposition 2.5. Let (, u) be the local-in-time strong solution of (1.1)-(1.3) satisfying (2.11). For each pair (~, u~) satisfying the same regularity assumption as that of (, u) listed in (2.11), we define the relative energy functional

Y. LU AND P. ZHANG

There are also similar relative entropy inequalities related to finite energy weak solutions of different models: for instance, Theorem 2.4 of [7] for the compressible Navier­Stokes equations and Proposition 5.3 of [18] for a compressible Oldroyd-B model. The proof of Proposition 2.5 follows the same line as the argument in [7] or [18], and we skip the details here.
Thanks to Proposition 2.5, we shall prove in Section 7.1 that

Proposition 2.6. Let T be given by (2.14). Then for all t < T, one has

(2.21)

t

|R|2 + 2 (t) dx dy +

|R|2 dx dy dt  C,

where the positive constants C is independent of T.

In Section 7.4, we shall prove the energy estimate for the derivatives of R.

Proposition 2.7. Let the energy functional E(T ) be given by (1.14). Then for all T  T, one has

(2.22)

Here we introduce the following refined Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequality in :

The proof of Lemma 2.1 will be presented in Appendix B.

Motivated by [15, 19], we define the effective viscous flux F for the system (2.13) as follows

(2.24)

F d=ef div R - p() - p(a) .

Lemma 2.2. For T  T, one has

(2.25)

Proof. In view of the continuity equations of (1.1) and (2.13), we write

Dt(log  - log a) + R ·  log a + div R = -(a)-1[(w)y],

which together with (2.24) implies

Dt(log  - log a) = -R ·  log a - -1 F + p() - p(a) - (a)-1[(w)y].
Multiplying the above equation by 6(log  - log a)5 and then applying Young's inequality gives Dt(log  - log a)6 + 6-1 p() - p(a) (log  - log a)5 = -5 R ·  log a + -1F + (a)-1[(w)y] (log  - log a)5  C |R ·  log a|6 + |F|6 + |(a)-1[(w)y]|6 + | log  - log a|6.
Notice that for t < T, there holds (2.15) so that 6-1 p() - p(a) (log  - log a)5  2C| log  - log a|6  | log  - log a|6 + ( - a)6,

for some small positive constant  and some C  2. We thus obtain

(2.26) Dt(log  - log a)6 + ( - a)6  C |R ·  log a|6 + |F|6 + |(a)-1[(w)y]|6 .

Let us introduce the particle trajectory X(t, x, y) of u via

holds for all t < T and   0 d=ef min{1, 2}, then regularity criteria for smooth solutions of

compressible Navier-Stokes equations (see for instance [11, 28, 29]) ensures that T = . This

3. 1D compressible Navier-Stokes equations with a parameter

In this section, we investigate the 1D compressible Navier-Stokes equations (1.6) with a parameter
y. We assume that (, w) is a global smooth solution of (1.6) determined at the beginning of Section 2. For simplicity, we shall always neglect y variable and denote Dt d=ef t + wx to be the material derivative in the rest of this section.

3.1. Conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. Integrating (1.6) in x over T leads to

the conservations of the mass and of the momentum:

(3.1)

d dt

(t, x, y) dx = 0,
T

and

d dt

(w)(t, x, y) dx = 0,
T

which together with (1.10) ensures that

(3.2)

(t, x, y) dx = 1,
T

Recall the conservation of energy:

(w)(t, x, y) dx = 0,  t  R+, y  R.

3.2. Upper bound for the density function. We observe from (2.2) that the density function
 admits an upper bound depending on time. We shall derive here a time uniform upper bound for . We first recall from [26] that for u  L1(T) and for all x  T

(3.6)

(3.9)

where ¯0 is given in (2.1) and ¯1 will be determined by (3.15) below.

Y. LU AND P. ZHANG

Proof. We rewrite the momentum equation in (1.6) as

(w)t + (w2)x - wxx + p()x = 0.

Applying the operator I~ to the above equation gives

(3.10)

I~ (w)t + w2 - wx + p() - w2 - wx + p() = 0.

We first compute

I~ (w)t = tI~(w) = DtI~(w) - wxI~(w) = DtI~(w) - w2.

While it follows from the transport equation of (1.6) that

-wx

=

-wx 

=

t

+ wx 

=

Dt log .

By inserting the above equalities into (3.10) and the fact that wx = 0, we obtain

(3.11)

DtI~(w) + Dt log  + p() - w2 + p() = 0.

Let X(t, x, y) be the trajectory of w, which is determined by

(3.12)

d dt

Xw (t,

x,

y)

=

w(t,

X (t,

x,

y));

Xw(0, x, y) = x.

Let y(t, x, y) = log (t, Xw(t, x, y), y). Then in view of (3.11), we write

(3.13) with



d dt

y

=

g(y)

+

d dt

b

g(y) = -p() + w2 + p() , b = -I~(w).

Before proceeding, we recall the following lemma:

Lemma 3.2 (Lemma 1.3 of [27]). Suppose g  C(R) and y, b  W 1,1(0, T ) for all T > 0. Suppose

that y verifies

d dt y

=

g(y)

+

d dt b

on R+,

y(0) = y0.

If g(+) = - and there exist non-negative constants N0, N1  0 so that for any 0  t1 < t2 < ,

b(t2) - b(t1)  N0 + N1(t2 - t1).

Then one has

y(t)  ¯y < ,  t  R+ with ¯y d=ef max{y0, y1} + N0,

where y1 is such that g(y)  -N1 for all y  y1.

Now we would like to apply Lemma 3.2 to derive an upper bound of  via (3.13). Firstly, it follows from (3.5) and (3.4) that

g(y) = -p(ey) + w2 + p() dx  -p(ey) + E¯00  -, as y  +.

where ¯0 is given in (2.1). This leads to (3.9).

3.3. Decay estimates of L2 norms. With the upper bound of  obtained in (3.9), similarly to Lemma 2.1 of [32], we have

Lemma 3.3. Under the assumptions of (1.10), one has

So that if   [1, 2], we have

(3.20)

P () - P (1) - P (1)( - 1)  a(1 + ¯)-2( - 1)2.

While for   [1, 2], it is easy to observe that

(3.21)

P () - P (1) - P (1)( - 1)  C()a( - 1)2,

where the constant C is solely determined by . It follows from (3.20) and (3.21) that P () - P (1) - P (1)( - 1) behaves like ( - 1)2.

Let  d=ef -1. Then we deduce from equation (4.1)1 that

Therefore, we obtain

Proof. Applying Dt to ×(4.22) gives

Dt2wy + DtDtwy + Dt(wxwy) + Dt(yDtw) - Dtwyxx + Dtp()yx = 0.

It is easy to observe that

DtDtwy = -wxDtwy = wx(wxwy + yDtw - wyxx + p()yx),

Dt(wxwy) = Dt(wx)wy + wxDtwy,

Dt(yDtw) = -(ywx + xwy + wyx)Dtw + yDt2w,

-Dtwyxx = -(Dtwy)xx + (2wxwyxx + wxxwyx),

and Dtp()yx = p()tyx + wp()yxx.

Then by taking L2(T) inner product of (4.31) with Dtwy and using the fact

Y. LU AND P. ZHANG

Thanks to (4.29), we conclude (4.30) by using the mass and momentum equations (4.1).

4.4. Proof of Proposition 2.2.

Proof of Proposition 2.2. By summarizing Propositions 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, we deduce that there exist two positive constants C and  solely depends on (a, , , ¯0, E¯20, 0, E¯1(10)) such that

(4.33)

1
y Hh1 + wy Hh2 + yt L2h + wyt L2h  C E2(10)(y) 2 e-t,  t  R+.

In what follows, we shall follow the same strategy as that of the proof of Proposition 2.1. We first get, by applying x to (4.1), that

(4.34)

yxt + (w)yxx = 0, (w)yxt + (w2)yxx - wyxxx + p()yxx = 0.

We can also rewrite (4.34)2 as

(4.35)

Dtwyx + (wywxx + 2wxwyx) + -1y(Dtwx + wx2) + -1x(Dtwy + wxwy) + -1yxDtw - -1wyxxx + -1p()yxx = 0.

We split the proof of the remaining estimates in (2.4) into the following steps:

Step 1. Decay estimates for yxx.

Recalling that  d=ef -1, we deduce from (4.34)1 that

(4.36)

wyxxx = Dtyxx - yxwxx - xwyxx - ywxxx + xxxwy + yxxwx + xxwyx.

Plugging (4.36) into (4.35) gives rise to

Dt(wyx - yxx) + wx(wyx - yxx) + (wywxx + wxwyx) + -1y(Dtwx + wx2) + -1x(Dtwy + wxwy) + -1yxDtw -  -yxwxx - xwyxx - ywxxx + xxxwy + xxwyx + -1p()yxx = 0.

By taking L2(T) inner product of the above equation with (wyx - yxx) and using the decay estimates we have derived in the previous sections, we obtain

Step 2. Decay estimates for Dtwyx.

We first rewrite (4.34)2 as

(4.41)

Dtwyx - wyxxx + g + p()yxx = 0, g d=ef (wywxx + 2wxwyx) + y(Dtwx + wx2) + x(Dtwy + wxwy) + yxDtw.

By taking L2(T) inner product of (4.41) with -1wyxxx, we obtain

(4.42)

Dtwyxwyxxx dx -  -1|wyxxx|2 dx + g + p()yxx -1wyxxx dx = 0.

In view of (4.22), we write

Our desired estimate (5.9) follows from (5.17) and (5.18).

5.2. Proof of Proposition 2.3.

Proof of Proposition 2.3. We divide the proof into the following two steps:

Step 1. Decay estimate of yyx.

The idea to derive the decay estimate of yyx is similar as that of yxx in Section 4.4. In what follows, we just outline its derivation. In order to do so, wfirst e rewrite (5.1)2 as
(5.19) Dtwyy + (2wywyx + wyywx) + -1 2y(Dtwy + wywx) + yyDtw - wyyxx + p()yyx = 0.

While it follows from (5.1)1 that

(5.20)

wyyxx = Dtyyx - yywxx - ywyxx - ywyxx + yxxwy + yxxwy + xxwyy.

Plugging (5.20) into (5.19) gives

(5.21)

Dt(wyy - yyx) + -1p()yyx + g1 = 0,

with

g1 =(2wywyx + wyywx) + 2-1y(Dtwy + wywx) + -1yyDtw - (-yywxx - ywyxx - ywyxx + yxxwy + yxxwy + xxwyy).

Then we deduce from Propositions 2.1, 2.2 and 5.1 that

(5.22)

By taking L2(T) inner product of (5.21) with (wyy - yyx) and using (5.22), we find

(wyy - yyx)2 dx -

p()-2yxx(wyy - yyx) dx

Step 2. Decay estimates of Dtwyy.
The main idea to derive the decay estimates of Dtwyy is analogues to that of Dtwyx in Section sec-decay-y-all. We shall outline its proof below.

By summarizing the estimates (5.9), (5.25), (5.29) and (5.30), we conclude the proof of (2.5).

6. Decay estimates of w

With the decay estimates for (, w) obtained in the previous sections, we are going to derive
the same exponential decay estimates for w. Notice that the equation for w, (1.7), is of standard
parabolic type, we shall only present the main decay in time estimates of w and skip the derivation of the related estimates concerning (yw, y2w).
The main results state as follows

Proposition 6.1. For all t  R+, one has

(6.1a)

(6.1c)

Proof. 1) We first get, by taking L2(T) inner product of (1.7) with w and using integrating by parts, that

(6.2)

1d 2 dt

|w|2 dx + µ
T

|wx|2 dx = 0.
T

While observing from the density equation of (1.6) and (1.7) that

(w)t + (ww)x - µx2w = 0.

GLOBAL SOLUTIONS OF 2D COMPRESSIBLE NAVIER-STOKES SYSTEM

Integrating the above equation over T gives

d dt

(w) dx = 0,
T

which together with (1.10) ensures that

(6.3)

(w) dx = 0w0 dx = 0.

T

Then we get, by using a similar proof of Lemma 3.3, that

By virtue of (6.4), we deduce from (6.2) that

3) Applying Dt to (1.7) gives We observe that and As a result, it comes out

Dt(Dtw) - µDtx2w = 0. Dt(Dtw) = (-xw)Dtw + Dt2w, Dtx2w = x2(Dtw) - x(xwxw).

(6.6)

Dt2w - µx2(Dtw) = (xw)Dtw - µx(xwxw).

By taking L2(T) inner product of (6.6) with Dtw, we find

Then by using a similar proof of Lemma 3.3 and Gronwall's inequality, we find

(6.9)

|w|2 + |wx| + |Dtw|2 dx  CE(y)e-t.
T

Observing that µxxw = Dtw, we conclude the proof of (6.1c). This completes the proof of Proposition 6.1.

Let us now outline the proof of Proposition 2.4.

Proof of Proposition 2.4. Along the same line to proof of Proposition 6.1 and through the induction method as what we used in the Appendix A, we deduce that

(6.10)

w(t) Hh5 + wt(t) Hh3 + wtt(t) Hh1  CE(y)e-t.

The decay estimates related to y-derivatives of w in (2.6) can be derived along the same line. We omit the details here.

7. Energy estimates for the perturbed equations
The purpose of this section is to present the proof of Propositions 2.6 and 2.7. For simplicity, we shall neglect the subscript  in the rest of this section.

7.1. Basic energy estimate. In this subsection, we shall derive a basic energy estimate for all t < T . We first deduce from Proposition 2.5 that

Lemma 7.1. Let (, u) and (a, ua) be respectively given by (2.7) and (2.11). Then one has

t

t

(7.1) E1 (, u)|(a, ua) (t) +

µ |(u - ua)|2 + µ|div (u - ua)|2 dx dy dt = R(t) dt,

where for G given by (2.9),

R(t) d=ef (a)-1( - a)(µua + µdiv ua) + (u - ua) · ua


(7.2)

+ (a)-1G · (ua - u) dx dy +  (a - )(a)-1p(a)[(w)y] dx dy


- div ua p() - p(a) - p(a)( - a) dx dy.


Proof. Since (, u) and (a, ua) have the same initial data, we get, by applying Proposition 7.1, that (7.1) holds with

(7.3)

R(t) d=ef Dtua · (ua - u) + µua : (ua - u) + µdiv ua div (ua - u)

+ (a - )tP () + (aua - u) · P (a) - div ua(p() - p(a)) dx dy.

It follows from the ua equation of (2.8) that

R1(t) d=ef  tua + ua · ua + (u - ua) · ua · (ua - u) dx dy

=  (a)-1 µua + µdiv ua - p(a) + G + (u - ua) · ua (ua - u) dx dy.


GLOBAL SOLUTIONS OF 2D COMPRESSIBLE NAVIER-STOKES SYSTEM

41

By using integration by parts and the fact that P (s) = s-1p(s), we find

R1(t) = (a)-1( - a) µua + µdiv ua - P (a) + (a)-1G · (ua - u) dx dy

- µua : (ua - u) + µdiv ua div (ua - u) dx dy

+ (u - ua) · ua · (ua - u) dx dy.

Plugging the above equality into (7.3) gives

R(t) = (a)-1( - a) µua + µdiv ua + (a)-1G + (u - ua) · ua


(7.4)

- P (a) · (ua - u) dx dy - div ua(p() - p(a)) dx dy


+ (a - )tP () + (aua - u) · P (a) dx dy.

Notice that P (s) = s-1p(s) and the renormalized equation

(7.5)

tP (a) + div (uaP (a)) + (P (a)a - P (a))div ua = P (a)[(w)y].

We get, by using the continuity equation (2.8)1, that

- P (a) · (ua - u) + (a - )tP () + (aua - u) · P (a)

(7.6)

= (a - ) tP (a) + ua · P (a) = (a - ) tP (a) + div (uaP (a)) + (P (a)a - P (a))div ua - P (a)adiv ua

= (a - )(a)-1p(a)[(w)y] - (a - )p(a)div ua.

Then (7.2) follows by inserting (7.6) into (7.4).

We now present the proof of Proposition 2.6.

Proof of Proposition 2.6. We first get, by applying (2.15) and Taylor's expansion, that for t < T ,

Along the same line and thanks to (2.17), we have

so that

Let us now handle term by term above. Notice that

Firstly,

By virtue of (1.1), we write
(7.21) DtDtR = div u(-DtR)

= div u - µR - µdiv R +  p() - p(a) + R · ua + (tua + ua · ua) - G .

We shall postpone the estimate of the above terms below. For i = 1, 2, we write

-µDtRi = -µtRi - µdiv (u · )Ri + µuj · jRi

= -µDtRi + µdiv uj · j Ri + µuj · j Ri. The last term above can be written as

µuj · j Ri = µkuj jkRi = µj kuj kRi - µkj uj kRi = µj kuj kRi - µk j ujkRi + µdiv uRi.

We observe that the last term above cancels with the first term on the right-side of (7.21), so that there holds

- div uR + DtR · DtR dx dy


= - DtR · DtR dx dy + k kujj R + j kuj kR - k juj kR · DtRi dx dy.





We get, by using integration by parts, that

- DtR · DtR dx dy = |DtR|2 dx dy,

To handle the pressure related terms, we write

In view of the continuity equations of (1.1) and (2.8), one has

t(p() - p(a)) = - div u(p() - p(a)) + p(a)R - a( - 1) div u - (a) div ua - p(a)[(w)y].

As a consequence, we deduce that

(div u)(p() - p(a)) + Dt p() - p(a) = -j uj(p() - p(a)) - div (p(a)R) - a( - 1)  div u - (a)div ua -  p(a)[(w)y ] ,

from which and Theorem 1.1, we deduce that

(div u)(p() - p(a)) + Dt p() - p(a) · DtR dx dy


(7.24)

= (p() - p(a))(ua + R) : DtR dx dy + (p(a)div R + p(a) · R)

(A.6)

(n) d=ef xn and w(n) d=ef xnw.

Then it follows from (1.6) that ((n), w(n)) verifies

This finishes the proof of Proposition 2.1.

Now let us present the proof of Lemma A.1.

Proof of Lemma A.1. We first rewrite (A.7)2 as

Dtw(n) - wx(nx) + (p())(n+1) = -g~n, with

By applying Dt to (A.19) and then taking L2h inner product of the resulting equation with Dtw(n), we find

(A.20)

Dt2w(n) + DtDtw(n) - Dtwx(nx) + Dt(p())n Dtw(n) dx = - Dtg~nDtw(n) dx.

T

T

In what follows, we shall frequently use the estimates (A.5c), (A.13) and (A.14) to handle the terms above.
We first observe that

(A.21)

Dt2w(n)Dtw(n) dx

T

T

T

Notice that

Dtwx(nx) = (Dtw(n))xx - (2wxwx(nx) + wxxwx(n)).

Then, by using integration by parts, we get that

It remains to handle the source term in (A.20). Indeed in view of (A.20), we find that the most trouble terms are the following ones with highest derivatives on  or w in g~n:

(A.25)

g~n(1) d=ef (1)wt(n-1) + (1)wwxn-1 + w(1)w(n) = (1)Dtw(n-1) + w(1)w(n), g~n(2) d=ef (n) + (n) + w(n)w(1).

Observe that

Dt((1)Dtw(n-1)) = (Dtx)Dtw(n-1) + xDt2w(n-1) = Dtx-1 wx(nx-1) - (p())(n) - g~n-1 + x(Dt-1) wx(nx-1) - (p())(n) - g~n-1
+ x-1Dt wx(nx-1) - (p())(n) - g~n-1 .

It follows from (A.5c), (A.13) and (A.14) that

Dtx-1 wx(nx-1) - (p())(n) - g~n-1 Dtw(n) dx

wx(nx-1) - (p())(n) - g~n-1

and

|Dtw(n)|2 dx
T

 CEn+2,0(y)e-t + |Dtw(n)|2 dx.

Next we deal with the term T x-1Dt wx(nx-1) - (p())(n) - g~n-1 dx. We compute

x-1Dtwx(nx-1) = x-1(Dtw(n))x - x-1wxwx(n),

so that

x-1Dtwx(nx-1)Dtw(n) dx = x-1(Dtw(n))xDtw(n) dx - x-1wxwx(n)Dtw(n) dx

The other terms in (A.25) can be handled along the same line.

By substituting the estimates (A.21­A.24) and (A.26) into (A.20), we conclude the proof of

(A.17). This finishes the proof of Lemma A.1.

Appendix B. Proof of Lemma 2.1
