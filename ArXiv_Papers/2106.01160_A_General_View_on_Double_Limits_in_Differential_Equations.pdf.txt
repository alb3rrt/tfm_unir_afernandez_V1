In this paper, we review several results from singularly perturbed differential equations with multiple small parameters. In addition, we develop a general conceptual framework to compare and contrast the different results by proposing a three-step process. First, one specifies the setting and restrictions of the differential equation problem to be studied and identifies the relevant small parameters. Second, one defines a notion of equivalence via a property/observable for partitioning the parameter space into suitable regions near the singular limit. Third, one studies the possible asymptotic singular limit problems as well as perturbation results to complete the diagrammatic subdivision process. We illustrate this approach for two simple problems from algebra and analysis. Then we proceed to the review of several modern double-limit problems including multiple time scales, stochastic dynamics, spatial patterns, and network coupling. For each example, we illustrate the previously mentioned three-step process and show that already double-limit parametric diagrams provide an excellent unifying theme. After this review, we compare and contrast the common features among the different examples. We conclude with a brief outlook, how our methodology can help to systematize the field better, and how it can be transferred to a wide variety of other classes of differential equations.

1. INTRODUCTION
Effectively all problems arising from science and engineering are studied by only considering a suitably reduced model of reality. In particular, we would often like to reduce differential equations by assuming that certain physical effects or external influences do not play a major role for the scientific question of interest. Yet, this implicitly supposes we can also show that the terms we do neglect are in some sense "small" so that they do not change the answers to the relevant scientific questions. There is a vast number of differential equations, where we are faced with trying to prove that certain terms do not influence our results. In each problem, we usually have small parameters, which control the strength of the terms we want to neglect. Some typical examples appearing in the context of differential equations are:
· Time Scale Separation: Two, or more, sets of variables evolve at different rates.
· Noise Level: Finite-size effects or external forces are modeled via noise.
· Spatial Scale Separation: Two, or more, sets of vari-

ables have differing spatial scales.
· Network Coupling: Operating a system within a network leads to new coupling dependencies.
In this paper, we are going to focus on these areas to illustrate the types of results one can obtain for (multiple) small parameters. Of course, there are many other areas in differential equations, where small parameters appear, for example:
· Discretization Size: Temporal and/or spatial discretization leads to small parameters.
· Inverse Particle Number: One wants to convert finite systems to a continuum model.
· Interfaces: Interfaces or boundary layers are often small.
· Nonlocal Coupling: Local derivatives are augmented by global integral terms.
· Nonsmoothness: Functions are taken smooth outside of small subsets of space.

2

· Time Delay: (Small) communication delay induces a time history dependence.
· Near-Symmetry: A system might be very close to a symmetric one.
· Near-Integrability: Perturbations of integrable and/or Hamiltonian systems are well-studied.
Even the combination of the two previous lists is just a restricted snapshot of all potential cases where small parameters may appear. From a historical perspective, small parameters in differential equations are a quite classical topic that can be traced back at least to the end of the 19th century. Among the first applications were celestial mechanics [189] and fluid dynamics [191]. In celestial mechanics, since the two-body problem is often easily solvable, the three-body problem naturally lends itself to consider singular perturbations by assuming two large mass bodies and one very small mass. In fluid mechanics, assuming very large viscosity is helpful as this assumption usually precludes the existence of turbulent flow. In the limited space of this work, it is impossible to give proper credit to the very successful, long, and sometimes winding, history of singular perturbations in celestial mechanics and fluid dynamics, so we refer to [37, 108, 182, 208] containing excellent historical accounts and references regarding the development of these areas.
Within the 20th century, the use of small parameters and perturbation techniques for differential equations have permeated effectively all areas of science and engineering, while more recently also quantitative modelling in the social sciences tends to rely on differential equation modelling. For some pointers to the vast literature, we refer to the books [25, 27, 107, 122, 128, 133, 145, 177, 181, 186, 193, 209, 213, 214], where classical cases of ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs) with one small parameter are considered from a number of different viewpoints.
Although the literature is quite detailed, it has become apparent in recent years that several techniques have to be extended to deal with more complex 21st century challenges, where differential equations and small parameters still take center stage. First, one might wonder, why existing methods have to be developed further? The first key reason is that mathematical modeling of complex systems almost immediately dictates that the case of just one small parameter is very rare. For example, it would be very difficult to argue that global climate dynamics, socio-economic networked systems, or neuro-mechanical as well as systems biology problems, frequently contain just one small parameter. Second, in complex systems we often deal with many instabilities. Each instability, even if it is localized in parameter and phase space, leads to a delicate balance between nonlinear terms. Hence, we cannot invoke simple principles that very stable leading-order linear terms dominate so that small contributions from external/internal model perturbations are irrelevant. This entails the need for

larger phase and parameter spaces [144]. In summary, there is an imminent need to study the case of two or more small parameters carefully to obtain a good practical understanding of current important topics differential equations.
As one might expect, this field also has some history within several sub-disciplines of differential equations. Among the most classical cases, where two small parameters have been analyzed first, were ODEs with a focus on direct asymptotic methods such as matching [92, 169, 179, 180], although more recently also more geometric ODE approaches have gained popularity, see e.g. [56, 139, 140, 147]. Although extensions of existing approaches are often key components for our understanding of multiple small parameters, the development is not nearly as systematic and detailed as for just one distinguished small parameter. One can view the situation in analogy with several other areas of differential equations, e.g., second-order scalar oscillators already show a lot of interesting behaviour but eventually one has to go beyond a widely accepted standard class. Therefore, we believe it is now time to re-think and systematize double limits in differential equations. In fact, virtually within all areas of differential equations, multiple small parameters do appear. In this review, we try to reflect this broader perspective via several illustrating examples motivated by very different applications. We are going to describe many key challenges, where a naive direct approach of taking double limits fails.
More precisely, a common, yet highly non-trivial, situation we want to understand are doubly-singularly perturbed differential equations, or more generally multiscale dynamics with multiple small parameters. As argued above, already a unified framework to understand doubly-singular perturbations is still lacking so this will be our starting point. Here we make a conceptual step towards improving this situation.
Consider a doubly-singularly perturbed differential equation with two small non-negative parameters  and . Often we are interested in the local behavior of the differential equation in the cone
K := {(, )  R2 :   0,   0}
intersected with a sufficiently small ball around the origin. The natural step is to try to partition K into different regions as shown in Figure 1. To make such a partitioning precise, we propose several steps:
(S1) Specify the setting and restrictions of the problem X to be studied.
(S2) Define a notion of equivalence via a property/observable P for the partitioning.
(S3) Study the possible asymptotic limit problems A to complete the diagram.

FIG. 1: Sketch of a partitioning of the positive quadrant K near the doubly-singular limit   0 and   0 into three different regions (I)­(III), which are non-equivalent under a property P. The thick lines (in blue) indicate hard boundaries between the different regions, e.g. between (II) and (III) there is a precise curve separating these regions. The thin line (in red) indicates that the boundary is only asymptotic up to a constant between two regions. Dashed lines (in black) indicate an unclassified axis (such as the vertical axis in this figure). The circle at the origin also means that at this point a classification with respect to P is not known and/or may not even be possible.
In the available literature, these steps can be found in various incarnations and various levels of mathematical rigor. What tends to be missing in many problems is to recognize (S1)­(S3) in a clear way to allow for a more comparative and systematic classification of possible behaviors. Already very simple classical examples, as discussed in Section 2, show that missing small details or slight changes in the setting X or definition P in the steps (S1)-(S2) can lead to completely different answers. We are going to show in this work that if the steps (S1)­(S3) are carried out carefully and within a uniform framework, a surprisingly coherent picture emerges, how doubly-singularly perturbed differential equations can be studied. The cross-connections between different classes of effects and methods become more visible. Universal classification diagrams emerge that concisely make the differences and similarities between different sub-fields of differential equations visible. Hence, a systematic study of doubly-singular limits can be viewed as another unifying scientific principle in the analysis of differential equations.
The remaining part of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we explain our approach via simple examples from analysis and algebra without a direct reference to differential equations. The core part of this work is contained in Section 3, where numerous classes of known results for differential equation problems are re-cast precisely in the three steps (S1)­(S3) to provide a general framework, which highlights the unity of area. This includes problems from fast-slow ODE dynamics, small noise stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), spatial problems arising from the bifurcation analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs), and a problem in largescale network dynamics. In Section 4, we then contrast

3
and compare the results. Section 5 provides an outlook towards a more systematic study of multi-parameter singular limits for differential equations.

2. CLASSICAL EXAMPLES
Before starting with the development of a singular limit analysis of various classes of differential equations, we illustrate some basic principles that occur in the steps (S1)­(S3) in simpler settings.

2.1. Elementary Algebra

Consider the root-finding problem of a very simple quadratic polynomial

f (x; , ) := x2 -  =! 0.

(Xrts)

For the problem (Xrts), we assume that we do not allow any coordinate changes and/or preliminary algebraic scaling operations for the problem, i.e., we want to find the roots as is. For any ,  > 0, we have the roots x± = ± /. Now it crucially depends on the choice of the property P what a classification diagram in a form similar to Figure 1 would look like. Suppose we take as a definition that two problems of the form (Xrts) are equivalent if they have the same property

P[-1,1] := cardinality{x  [-1, 1] : f (x; , ) = 0},
where we count roots according to multiplicity. Then one just calculates |x±|2 = /  1 which yields   . Hence, there are just two regions in the (, )-diagram separated by the diagonal { = }  K. Above the diagonal, we have  >  so P[-1,1]|> = 0, while on or below the diagonal we have P[-1,1]| = 2. Of course, the point at the origin is special leading to a solution set which is uncountable so we decide to leave it out in our classification; see Figure 2.

 
 II 

 I 
 FIG. 2: Classification diagram with respect to the property P[-1,1]. In region II we have no zeros while in region I we have two zeros (counting multiplicity).
The splitting into two main regions is also visible via considering the two singular limit problems of (Xrts),

4

namely

lim f (x; , ) = - =! 0,
0

(Art=s0)

and

lim f (x; , ) = x2 =! 0,
0

(Art=s 0 )

where we get no roots and a double-root respectively. In summary, there is also an inherent non-commutativity in the limits. Yet, the precise setting of (Xrts) and the specification P[-1,1] are crucial. For example, if we use PR instead, looking for all the real roots, then there is only one naturally singular line remaining in parameter space given by { = 0,  > 0} with no roots and the usual singular situation at the point (, ) = (0, 0). Also, given the function

f (x; , ) := x2 - 

(1)

we could have used a completely different property P to check for equivalence. For example, we could ask for a binary classification and set

Pcvx =

1 if f is convex in x, 0 if f is not convex in x.

(2)

which is known to be a simple counter-example in the context of Schwarz's Theorem since the partial derivatives do not commute at zero

- 1 = xyf~(0, 0) = yxf~(0, 0) = 1.

(3)

Evidently, we can also just understand this via double limits in defining

f (x, y; , )

:=

f~(x+,y+)-f~(x,y+) 

+

f~(x,y)-f~(x+,y) 

,

and then (3) just means that

lim lim f (x, y; , ) = lim lim f (x, y; , )

0 0

0 0

if we evaluate the two limits at (x, y) = (0, 0). Evidently the subdivision of the cone K again depends crucially on the choice of the property P. However, here we shall fix the relevant property via second partial derivatives below.

 I 


FIG. 3: Classification diagram with respect to the property Pcvx. We just have a single region as f (x; , ) = x2 -  is always convex on K.
Then we always have Pcvx|(,)K = 1 so the singular limit classification is somewhat trivial as shown in Figure 3. This demonstrates that, although many a-priori natural looking mathematical properties could be used for double limits, it is vital to have a good motivation from applications and modeling to select the most important ones.

2.2. Elementary Analysis

The issues illustrated in the last section are evidently not limited to just purely algebraic problems. For example, let us consider the classical function

f~(x, y) :=

xy (x2 -y 2 ) x2 +y 2

if (x, y) = (0, 0),

0

if (x, y) = (0, 0),

(Xpartials)

 I 

FIG. 4: Classification diagram with respect to the property P. The two regions correspond to the two possible partial derivative values at the origin of the function (Xpartials) given for our elementary analysis problem. The thin line (red) could have been chosen at any fixed slope as it is an asymptotic subdividing line of the form { = ,  > 0} for some fixed constant  > 0.

Since we are in an analytic setting, and not in an alge-
braic one, it often makes sense not to aim for a point-wise
subdivision of the cone K. Instead, we are going to use an
asymptotic subdivision by assuming that  = () with   C0(R+0 , R+0 ) and (0) = 0, which just means that  is a continuous function of  vanishing simultaneously. If
we define

P

:=

lim
0

f

(x,

y;

,

())|(x,y)=(0,0)

then there are two main regions in K. Either we have () = o() as   0 (alternatively written  ), which yields P = -1. Or we have   leading to P = +1. Hence, it is natural to divide K into two regions via a line  =  for a fixed constant  > 0. The constant  is somewhat arbitrary as long it is independent of  and  so we just write for the codimension-one subdivision line K  { }; see Figure 4.

As a next step, it is important to demonstrate that different classes of doubly-singularly perturbed differential equations fit within and benefit from the more unified view described so far. We shall illustrate this aspect with several very recent examples, where one cannot only recast the problem within our framework but where the main strategy and effects become very transparent as a result.

3.1. Multiple Time Scale Systems

We start with arguably one of the most classical [25, 122, 181] cases of singular perturbation problems [182, 209], namely ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with two time scales, so-called fast-slow systems [128, 131, 145]. A good illustration within this context is to consider the transcritical fast-slow bifurcation normal form

dx dt

=x

=

(x

-

y)(x

+

y)

+

2 

,

dy dt

=

y

= ,

(Xtc)

which is a well-studied system [142]. As before, we shall assume that   0 is a small parameter and then consider the case when   0 is a second small parameter. Taking the fast subsystem limit (Xtc) given by   0 yields

x = x2 - y2, y = 0,

(Atc=,f0)

which is just a standard transcritical bifurcation with the slow variable y acting as a bifurcation parameter. If we re-scale time as s := t and take the singular limit   0 again, then one obtains the slow subsystem

0 = (x - y)(x + y),

dy ds

=

1.

(Atc=,s0)

The fast and slow subsystems (Atc=,f0)-(Atc=,s0) already show a singular structure as the systems are differen-
tial equations of different types. The algebraic constraint
within the slow subsystem is given by the critical mani-
fold

C0 := {(0, 0)}  C0a-  C0a+  C0r-  C0r+

where C0a- := {|x| = |y|, x < 0, y < 0}, C0a+ := {|x| =

|y|, x < and C0r+

0, y > 0}, := {|x| =

C0r- := |y|, x >

{|x| = |y|, x 0, y > 0} are

> 0, y < normally

0}, hy-

perbolic since the linearization with respect to the fast

variables yields Dx(x2 - y2) = 2x, which is nonzero on C0 \ {(0, 0)}. The critical manifold C0 consists of equilibrium points for the fast subsystem; see also Figure 5.

Fenichel Theory [88, 128, 145] implies that there exist

associated slow manifolds Ca± and Cr±.

FIG. 5: Sketch of the possible dynamics of (Xtc) in (x, y)coordinates. The critical manifold C0 is shown in gray (repelling parts with dashed lines and attracting parts with solid lines). Three trajectories (green, cyan, magenta) for 0 <  1 are indicated for three different choices of  (corresponding to the exchange-of-stability, canard, and critical transition cases respectively). Double arrows show the direction of the fast subsystem flow for orientation; the slow subsystem dynamics on C0 is always directed upwards at unit speed.

A generally very important question in many applications is how trajectories of fast-slow systems pass through the region of a transcritical bifurcation of the fast subsystem; for example, there are applications in ecology [51, 135], chemistry [143], numerical analysis [82], epidemiology [124] and network science [125]. Suppose we start with a trajectory  = (t) at a typical point on the attracting critical manifold C0a-, say (0) = (x(0), y(0)) = (-3, -3) for concreteness as the following arguments do not change up to scaling by fixed constants. By Fenichel Theory, we have that (0) is O()close to the slow manifold Ca-. We are going to define two one-dimensional sections:
- := {x = -2, y  [1, 3]}, + := {x = 2, y  [-1, 1]}.
One may easily prove that the trajectory  will first get attracted to Ca- exponentially fast and then track this manifold up towards the origin due to the slow dynamics. Then there are three cases [142]:
(I) If () = (1 + O(||p)), for some p > 0, then the trajectory will intersect -.
(II) If () = (1 - O(||p)), for some p > 0, then the trajectory will intersect +.
(III) If () = (1 ± O(exp(-K/))), then the trajectory will never intersect ±.
This classification is important as in case (I) we have an exchange-of-stability as  starts to track the attracting slow manifold Ca+, while in case (II), there is a critical transition leading to a jump near the fast subsystem bifurcation point. In case (III), we have that  starts to track the repelling branch Cr+ for a slow time of order

6

O(1), which means that we have a canard orbit [26, 145].

Hence, since these three cases differ crucially for applica-

tion purposes, it makes sense to define a property Ptcd by a variable having just three possible values correspond-

ing to the cases (I)-(III) respectively. This provides us

with the double singular limit in the cone K shown in

Figure 6.

 I 

FIG. 6: Classification diagram with respect to the property Ptcd for the problem (Xtc). The three regions correspond to the cases (I)­(III) above yielding exchange-of-stability, critical transition, and canard cases respectively.

In particular, the line () =  becomes a natural dividing line around which we find an asymptotically exponentially small wedge. Outside this wedge, we have two completely different dynamical behaviors (I) and (II) as described above. Note that it also makes sense to formally continue the classification of (I) and (II) onto the two lines { = 0,  > 0} and { > 0,  = 0} by using so-called candidate trajectories obtained by concatenating orbits of the suitable fast and slow subsystem singular limit problems. Yet, we evidently cannot make a meaningful classification at the origin (, ) = (0, 0) itself regarding our property due to the undefined expression 2/ in the last term of the fast variable dynamics in this case.
Obviously, the fast-slow normal form transcritical bifurcation case we have discussed here is just one of many cases in multiple time scale dynamics where several small parameters appear [145]. Another important system directly motivated by a particular application to the peroxidase-oxidase reaction is the Olsen model [67, 178]. It is given by

da ds

2(p1 - a) - aby,

( - bx) - aby,



dx ds

=

-x2 + (b - p2)x + 3aby + 2p4,

dy ds

=

p3(x2 - y - aby),

(XOl)

where (a, b, x, y)  (R+)4, we fix the parameters p1 = 0.97, p2 = 0.98, p3 = 3.93, p4 = 1.2 · 10-5 to the classical values considered by Olsen [67, 178] and take ,  as the
small parameters. Then one can prove [147] that for

2 ,

the system (XOl) exhibits non-standard, but regularly periodic, relaxation oscillations [172]. A singular limit

geometric phase space description [147], as well as numerical simulations [67, 178] and numerical continuation calculations [69, 174], strongly suggest that there are at least two further important asymptotic regimes namely
2  and 2 =  = (),  = O(1),

as   0. In these cases one observes mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) [68] and chaotic oscillations respectively, i.e., we have for the Olsen model
(I) 2 : non-standard relaxation oscillations,
(II) 2 = : chaotic oscillations,
(III) 2 : mixed-mode oscillations,

which is illustrated in Figure 7.

  II 

 I 

FIG. 7: Classification diagram with respect to the property Posc for the problem (XOl). Note that the two parabolic thin curves (red) have the same function form () = 2 just with two different constants  > 0. The three regions correspond to the cases (I)­(III) above yielding non-standard relaxation oscillations, MMOs, and chaotic oscillations respectively.
If we want to distinguish the three different classes of oscillation patterns (relaxation, MMO, chaos), then it does not suffice to rely on natural distinguishing properties individually such as number of maxima for one variable within a time interval Pmax, the sign of the top/leading Lyapunov exponent PLya, or topological equivalence of the phase portraits Ptop. For example, one expects that stable relaxation oscillations and MMOs may have topologically equivalent phase portraits and negative Lyapunov exponents for certain parameters. Furthermore, the number of maxima is also not a good indicator alone as for a given initial condition and a fixed time interval it is easily conceivable that an MMO and a chaotic oscillation have the same Pmax. Yet, suppose we fix a generic initial condition in the positive quadrant and a positive sufficiently large fixed time T = K with a constant K > 0 such that for Pmax we have a fixed number Pmax = K0 > 0 for the case of non-standard relaxation oscillations. Let us define
Posc := PmaxPLya;
then we expect that all three cases are different. Indeed, we conjecture that
· Posc = -K0: stable non-standard relaxation oscillations;

7

· Posc < -K0: stable mixed-mode oscillations;
· Posc > 0: chaotic oscillations.
Evidently, this is not a full classification, nor yet rigorously proven beyond the non-standard relaxation case. However, it is very helpful to conceptually understand the Olsen model and its analysis; see Figure 7. The difficulties of the problem are now made precise and much more apparent. Already defining the property P can be crucial to make the mathematical analysis tractable as proving a precise shape of a trajectory as well as an estimate of the Lyapunov exponent are highly non-trivial for global orbits of non-linear systems. Although methods from geometric singular perturbation theory exist to try to deal with this situation [98], we expect that for the Olsen model these may have to be augmented by computer-assisted proof techniques [101] to actually deal with tracking the dynamics in certain two- and threedimensional reduced systems. As another question, Figure 7 points us immediately to the transition regimes, i.e., one should ask how trajectories are deformed near the separating asymptotic boundary curves and what happens near/on the non-negative cone K in (, )parameter space. Such a discussion is beyond the scope of this work.
For our examples so far, the second small parameter arose due to the need to study a bifurcation problem, and the bifurcation parameter produced a double singular limit. Yet, in many applications there are additional "physical" modeling constraints, which naturally lead to two small parameters. A typical case is the effect of small noise, which is going to be discussed in the next subsection.

3.2. Stochastic Fast-Slow Systems

Among the most popular models for random noise acting on a dynamical system are stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by a Wiener process. There is a broad literature on such equations, based on different approaches such as analysing the Fokker­Planck equation [110], the theory of large deviations [91], and random dynamical systems [2]. Stochastic systems with multiple timescales have been more particularly analysed in [32, 129, 186]. The stochastic dynamics near bifurcation points has been studied, for instance, in [62, 123, 148, 199, 202]. A particularly important field of applications is neuroscience. In this respect, we refer to [205] for an overview, and to [14, 47, 74, 106, 138, 158, 159, 173, 197] for examples of specific problems involving bifurcations.
Consider a stochastic differential equation of the form

dxt = f (xt, t)dt + dWt ,

(4)

where f : R2  R is sufficiently smooth, and Wt is a Wiener process describing white noise. The small parameters are , which measures the slow drift of the "parameter" y = t, and , which measures the noise intensity.

In order to understand the influence of the noise on time scales, let us start by considering the case where f = f (x) does not depend on the second variable, and let V be a potential such that f (x) = -V (x). Assume that V has a minimum at x = 0. Then the theory of large deviations [91] implies that the probability of a solution of the SDE starting from x0 = 0 to reach a point x in a time of order 1 is of order e-V (x)/(22), assuming V is monotonous between 0 and x. This implies the so-called Arrhenius law [4], which states that the expected time for the solution to reach x has order eV (x)/(22). Solutions of the SDE thus tend to spend exponentially long time spans near stable stationary points of f .
When considering the slowly time-dependent system (4), it is convenient to scale time by a factor , so that f changes by order 1 in times of order 1. The rescaled system reads

1



dxt

=

 f (xt, t)dt

+

 

dWt

,

(Xsfs)

 where the factor  is due to the scaling property of the

Wiener process. Assume f has a smooth stable equilib-

rium branch x(t) acting as a critical manifold for (Xsfs). This means that f (x(t), t) = 0 for all t in some interval

I, and that a(t) = xf (x(t), t) is negative, bounded away from 0 in I. In the deterministic case  = 0, it

is well known [88, 204] that for small , (Xsfs) admits a so-called slow solution x¯(t) staying at a distance of order

 from x(t).

Let us now fix, say, I = [0, 1], and consider the solution

of (Xsfs) starting at time 0 in x¯(0). Denote by P (, )

the probability that the solution leaves a neighborhood

of x¯(t) at or before time 1. Then

(I) on one hand, the large-deviation results just mentioned imply that when  decreases to 0 for fixed  > 0, P (, ) converges to 0;

(II) on the other hand, irreducibility of the Markov process (xt)t0 implies that when  decreases to 0 for fixed  > 0, P (, ) converges to 1.

Hence, the regimes (I)-(II) naturally induce a property Psfs, which divides the (, )-space via the escape probability. The transition between P (, ) close to 0 and close to 1 occurs when  is of order e-H/(22) for an H > 0 depending on the considered neighborhood (Figure 8).
A more precise formulation of the regime  0 has been given in [29, 32]. Let B(h) be a family of strips centered in x(t), of width h/ 2|a(t)|, where a(t) = xf (x¯(t), t) is the linearization of f at the slow solution. These strips act as a kind of "confidence intervals", in the sense that the probability Pt(h, , ) of leaving B(h) before time t satisfies

In the case  > 0, we can define as above a strip B(h) centered in the slow solution x¯(t), and of width
h/ 2|a(t)|. Note that this time, the linearization |a(t)| has order max{|t|, }. The width of B(h) is maximal near t = 0, where it has order h/1/4. It turns out that one then has two qualitatively different situations [30]:
(I) If  3/4, we can take h of order 3/4 and still have a strip B(h) staying away from the origin. One can then show that the probability of a solution of (Xtcs) leaving B(h) before, say, time 1, has order exp[-h2/(22)] = exp[-3/2/2], which is exponentially small in this regime.
(II) If  3/4, on the other hand, any strip B(h) with h   intersects the t-axis already at or before a time of order -2/3. One can then show that it is very likely that the solution xt becomes negative, of order 1, shortly after time -2/3. The probability that xt remains positive up to time 1 has order e-4/3/( log(-1)).

of order  2 log(t/(p)), we obtain Pt(h, , ) p, so that B(h) is indeed a confidence strip at level p.
This first example of a two-scale behavior for an SDE is somewhat atypical compared to other examples given in this review, in the sense that the transition between qualitatively different regimes occurs when  is exponentially small in . Of course, one can "regularize" things by writing  = e-/2 and describing the behavior in terms of  and . This is the approach adopted in [90] for instance.
More standard examples of double limits can however be found in the vicinity of bifurcation points. Consider for instance the fast-slow SDE (Xsfs)

which is a stochastic version of (Xtc). The critical manifold of the deterministic equation x = t2 - x2 is com-
posed of a stable branch {x = x+(t) = |t| : t = 0} and

One can summarize the difference between the two regimes by considering the transition probability

Ptrans(, ) = P(x¯(t0),t0) t  1 : xt = -1 , (6)

where the superscript (x¯(t0), t0) indicates the initial condition. For negative t0 of order 1, we have

 e-3/2/2

in Regime (I) ,

Ptrans(, )  1 - e-4/3/( log(-1)) in Regime (II) ,

(7)

for a constant  > 0 (Figure 10). Hence, we can again use

a suitable transition probability to define a property Ptcs, which provides at least two clearly distinct asymptotic

regimes (I)-(II) in the double limit. See [32, Theorems

3.5.1 and 3.5.2] for precise formulations of these results.

An interesting generalization of Example (Xtcs) is the SDE

A similar analysis as for the transcritical bifurcation (Xtcs) can be made, and results in the following case distinction (Figure 11, see [30, Theorems 2.6 and 2.7] for precise formulations):

(Figure 14-(III)), meaning that after having spiked,

it is very likely to spike again immediately.

Note that these three regimes actually use a probabilistic asymptotic spiking pattern to define a property PFHs to dissect the (triple) singular limit parameter space. So the example nicely illustrates that also on a stochastic level, one can use macroscopic patterns, and that quite frequently even more than two small parameters are relevant.
The behavior in regimes just described in (I)­(III) can be considered as a stochastic instance of mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) [68], in which small-amplitude and

large-amplitude oscillations alternate; cf. problem (XOl). While deterministic MMOs often show a regular pattern, and sometimes a chaotic pattern, in the stochastic case considered here the number of small and largeamplitude oscillations are random variables. More intricate patterns can arise near folded-node bifurcations in three-dimensional SDEs, as for instance in the Koper model [33, 34].
The examples in this subsection have shown that the interplay between a deterministic multiple time scale system with small noise provides a very natural class of systems, and small noise induces a doubly singularly perturbed problem. Yet, stochastic differential equations provide many other natural avenues to double limits, even without explicit time scale separation for the drift. This is illustrated by the next subsection.

3.3. Shear-Induced Chaos

In this section, we consider the interaction of shear forces and stochastic noise that can generate a switching from synchronization to chaotic behavior in stochastic oscillators. The onset of chaos by an interplay of shear and, typically small, noise has been broadly discussed within the context of stochastic Hopf bifurcation [3, 15­17, 75, 156, 194], with important connections to coupled (neural) oscillators [42, 155, 157, 215] and questions around the role of noise and chaos in (turbulent) fluid flows [1, 87, 111, 112]. Note that the idea of adding small noise to prove chaotic properties in the deterministic zero-noise limit has become an important tool in dynamical systems theory in recent years [43, 44, 81, 218].
As a basic toy model (cf. [83]), we consider the SDE, written in Stratonovich form,

dy = -y dt + 

m i=1

fi()



dWti

,

d = (1 + by) dt ,

(Xsic)

11

where (y, )  R × S1 are cylindrical amplitude-phase coordinates, m  1 is a natural number, and Wti for i  {1, . . . , m} denote independent one-dimensional Brownian motions. We will assume that , , b  0, i.e. all parameters are non-negative.
When there is no noise ( = 0), the ODE (Xsic) has a globally attracting limit cycle at y = 0 with contraction rate  > 0; for  = 0, every trajectory is a periodic orbit at some y  R. In the presence of noise ( > 0), the amplitude direction is driven by phase-dependent random perturbations. The real parameter b induces an effect which is often called shear: if b > 0, the phase velocity depends on the amplitude y.
In the tradition of random dynamical systems theory [2], and in contrast to the sample paths approach in the last subsection, we now compare trajectories with different initial conditions but driven by the same noise. As trajectories depend on the noise realization, one cannot expect any convergent behavior of individual trajectories to a fixed attractor. An alternative point of view avoiding this problem is to consider, for a fixed noise realization in the past, the flow of a set of initial conditions from time t = -T to a fixed endpoint in time, say t = 0, and then take the (pullback) limit T  . If trajectories of initial conditions converge under this procedure to some set, then this set is called a random pullback attractor, or simply random attractor.
Typically, one can observe two different scenarios generated by the impact of noise on a stable limit cycle, as in model (Xsic) with  > 0: either synchronization of trajectories towards a random equilibrium (see Figure 15 (a)-(c)), or separation of trajectories within an attracting object, a random strange attractor with fractal properties (see Figure 15(d)-(f)). The crucial quantity for determining the character of the dynamics is the sign of the first Lyapunov exponent 1 = 1(, b, ) with respect to the ergodic invariant measure of the random system. The quantity 1 can be summarized as the dominant infinitesimal asymptotic growth rate of almost all trajectories.
The mechanism, whereby a combination of shear and noise leads to a positive Lyapunov exponent, was described as shear-induced chaos [156]. The noise perturbations drive some points of the deterministic limit cycle up and some down on the cylinder. Due to the phase-amplitude coupling b, the points with larger ycoordinates move faster in the -direction. At the same time, the dissipation force with strength  attracts the curve back to the limit cycles. This provides a mechanism for stretching and folding characteristic of chaos. The transition to chaos in the continuous time stochastic forcing is much faster than in the case of, e.g., periodic kicks [156]. This is due to the fact that points end up in areas with arbitrarily large values of y with positive probability such that already small shear can generate the described stretching and folding.
The validity of this mechanism has first been demonstrated analytically [185, 211, 212] in the case of periodically kicked limit cycles, including probabilistic charac-

terizations of the dynamics. An analytical proof of shearinduced chaos in the stochastic setting was developed in [83]. Based on a specific machinery to explicitly express Lyapunov exponents for noisy oscillators [117, 118] one can provide the formula

 b 

1(, b, ) = - 2 + 2 0 v m,b,(v) dv ,

and 2 is the second Lyapunov exponent, which is always negative unless  =  = 0. Furthermore, one
can prove the following result [83]: assume the functions fi : S1 [0, 1)  R to be C2, for some 0 <   1 to guarantee differentiability of the random dynamical
system (see [2, Theorem 2.3.32]), and, to make explicit
calculations possible, assume m  2 with

Then there is c0  0.2823 such that for all , b > 0, the number

is the unique value of  where the top Lyapunov exponent 1(, b, ) of (Xsic) changes sign:

  < 0 if 0 <  < 0(, b) , 
1(, b, ) = 0 if  = 0(, b) ,

 

>0

if  > 0(, b) .

12

In particular, we can just use the sign of the top Lyapunov exponent as a natural definition of a property Psic for the shear-induced chaos problem (Xsic). Figure 16 shows the graph of 0 for 0    1 and fixed b = 1. Note that for b,  = 0, we can always conduct a change of variables in the amplitude variable y to rescale the shear parameter b to 1 and the effective noise amplitude to b. Hence, the above result and the corresponding illustration in Figure 16 hold in precisely the same way, when the roles of  and b are exchanged.

For all fixed  > 0, if  = 0, i.e., in the zero-noise limit, we clearly have 1 = 0, now seen as the leading Lyapunov exponent associated with the attracting deterministic limit cycle. The convergence can also be seen by a different form of formula (12), which is obtained by a change of variables as

Hence, there is a continuous transition back to situation (III) at the -axis. When  = 0 but  > 0, dissipativity and the existence of a random attractor are lost and the system becomes volume-preserving. Still, the associated first Lyapunov exponent 1 is positive and the -axis belongs to situation (II), as can be easily seen from formula (12). The origin (, ) = (0, 0) itself belongs to (III). This gives a full categorization of model (Xsic) in terms of the first Lyapunov exponent under the double limit of the parameters , b on the one side and  on the other.
Generally, shear-induced chaos can take more complicated forms with more nonlinearities. A paradigm problem is the normal form of a Hopf bifurcation with additive noise

dx = (x - y - (ax - by)(x2 + y2)) dt +  dWt1 , dy = (y + x - (bx + ay)(x2 + y2)) dt +  dWt2 ,
(XsH)

where   0 is the strength of the noise,   R equals the real part of eigenvalues of the linearization of the vector field at (0, 0), b  R represents shear strength,   R is the linear component of rotational speed and Wt1, Wt2 denote independent one-dimensional Brownian motions. For  > 0, the deterministic system ( = 0) possesses a limit cycle at radius /a, for any fixed a > 0, with linear contraction rate -2.
The model has been studied in [72, 75, 216] with various, predominantly numerical, approaches to describing shear-induced chaos. Hence, it again makes sense to define PsH via the sign of the first Lyapunov exponent. For (XsH), only the case of synchronization, i.e. 1 < 0, has been proven analytically [75]. The change of sign of 1 to positive values is only proven in the particular context of the conditioned Lyapunov exponent [84], considering the random dynamics on a bounded domain with killing at the boundary, by conducting a computerassisted proof [52]. An explicit formula as before seems out of scope for system (XsH) on the whole domain.

FIG. 17: Fixing all other parameters in model (XsH), in particular b 2a, we consider the (, )-parameter space for ,  sufficiently small, and can associate the area beneath the diagonal with negative 1 (I) and the -axis, including the origin, with 1 = 0 (III).

However, there are two small parameter results that

give some indication concerning the question of double

limits in this case and demonstrate the differences to

the cylinder model. Firstly, it was shown in [72] and

thenfurther elaborated in [75] that for any fixed a > 0, b < 2a and  smaller than a given bound depending

on all other parameters, the first Lyapunov exponent

is negative, i.e. 1 < 0. This means that for the case b,   0 we will always be in scenario (I), in contrast

to model (Xsic) where scenario (II) can happen in the

double-limiting case, as illustrated in Figure 16 -- re-

call that  and b are interchangeable in this case and

the same formula and corresponding figure are also true

for replacing  by b. This does not transfer to the more

complicated, highly nonlinear situation of model (XsH).

Secondly, Deville et al. [72] demonstrate that 1 < 0 for



a 

 0.

This allows us to give at least a partial pic-

ture of the small parameter situation for ,  when the

shear strength b 2a is large; Figure 17 depicts such a

sufficiently small domain in parameter space. Analytical

approximation of other areas than the one beneath the

13

diagonal seems out of reach with current methods.
The examples involving SDEs have shown clearly that small noise is a natural source of double limits. Yet, SDEs still carry some regularity due to the (almost 1/2-H¨older) continuous input. The next subsection illustrates that even for stochastic switching problems one can frequently identify natural double limits.

3.4. Piecewise Deterministic Processes

Piecewise deterministic processes are stochastic processes that evolve deterministically on most time intervals of short length; random events occur instantaneously and come for example in the shape of random switches between several driving vector fields, or jumps to randomly chosen sites of the phase space. In this subsection, we will consider two instances of piecewise deterministic processes, which are induced by a parameter-dependent differential equation with an intermittently-acting noise that depends itself on a small parameter. We work within the following basic framework: Let M be an open subset of Rm, m  N, and let u0 and u1 be smooth vector fields on M that depend on a small positive parameter . In addition, assume that for i  {0, 1} and for every x0  M , the initial-value problem

x (t) = ui(x(t)), t > 0, x(0) = x0

has a unique solution x(t) = ti(x0) that is defined for all t  0. Consider the differential equation

dx = U (, x(t), t),
dt

(Xpd)

where  is a realization of a continuous-time Markov chain on {0, 1} with transition rates

1

= lim P(t
t0

= 0|0 t

= 1) ,

and where

U (, x, t) := u0(x), u1(x),

t = 0, t = 1.

The differential equation in (Xpd) is thus alternately driven by the vector fields u0 and u1, and switches between these vector fields correspond to the jumps of a continuous-time Markov chain. The latter being the only source of randomness, it is natural to assume that the transition rates 0 and 1 depend on a second small parameter  > 0. For a typical choice of , the equation in (Xpd) has a unique solution X() that is defined for all t  0. The resulting stochastic process X = (Xt)t0 on M can be turned into a Markov process by adjoining the process E = (Et)t0 on {0, 1} defined by Et() := t. The resulting two-component process (X, E) on the state

space M × {0, 1} belongs to the class of piecewise deterministic Markov processes [66].
In line with standard terminology, a stationary distribution for (X, E) is a probability measure µ on M ×{0, 1} such that for every Borel set A  M , i  {0, 1}, and t  0,

µ(A × {i}) =

Pt(x, j; A × {i}) µ(dx × {j}),

j{0,1} M

where (Pt)t0 denotes the Markov semigroup of (X, E).
Consider the dynamical system induced by randomly switching between the two-dimensional linear vector fields ui(x) = Uix, i  {0, 1}, where

U0 :=

- 1 0 -

,

U1 :=

- 0 -1 -

.

(Xpdl)

The switching rates are assumed to be 0 = 1 = -1, i.e. for small  we are in the regime of fast switching. This system belongs to the class of switching systems studied in [149]. Here, we present some of the main findings from [149] using the viewpoint of double limits in  and .
Both U0 and U1 are defective matrices, meaning that the eigenspaces corresponding to their only eigenvalue - have dimension 1. Since - < 0, the equilibrium point (0, 0) shared by u0 and u1 is globally asymptotically stable for each individual ODE x (t) = ui(x(t)). However, as pointed out in [19], [149] for the random case, and in [12] for the deterministic case, switching between stable ODEs may cause instability. This phenomenon can be easily apprehended if switching takes place between two stable vector fields that admit an unstable average. As the switching rates tend to infinity, the random dynamics start to resemble the deterministic dynamics governed by the unstable average [86]. For the present system, however, the mechanism causing instability is more subtle (Figure 18).

FIG. 18: Sample trajectories for the vector fields u0 and u1 associated with (Xpdl). The blue and red curves represent trajectories for u0 and u1, respectively. If one first flows along the blue curve towards the origin and then switches to the red one at the point where the curves touch, one can increase the distance to the origin.

14

Let us be more precise: We call the random dynamical system under consideration stable if the stochastic process X on R2, induced by alternately flowing along u0 and u1, satisfies
Px,i lim Xt = 0 = 1
t
for every x  R2 and i  {0, 1}. Here, Px,i denotes the law of the Markov process (X, E) starting at (x, i), and
· is the Euclidean norm on R2. The random dynamical system is said to be unstable if for every x  R2 \ {(0, 0)} and i  {0, 1},

Px,i lim Xt =  = 1.
t
A priori, there may be choices of  and  for which the system is neither stable nor unstable. As we are about to see, this is, at least generically, not the case. We want to study the property

Ppdl =

1 if the system is stable, 0 if the system is unstable.

It is convenient to represent the stochastic process X in polar coordinates (see [134] on the utility of polar decomposition for the study of Lyapunov exponents). Following [19], one defines the radial process Rt := Xt and the angular process At := Xt/ Xt whenever Xt = (0, 0). The two-component process (A, E) on S1 × {0, 1} is then again a piecewise deterministic Markov process characterized by random switching between the vector fields   sin2() and   cos2(), where S1 is identified with the interval [0, 2). According to [149, Lemma 3.2], (A, E) admits a unique stationary distribution µ that is absolutely continuous with respect to the product of arclength measure on S1 and counting measure on {0, 1}. In our example, µ only depends on the switching rate, i.e. it is a function of  while being independent of . Let  be the probability density function of µ and let i(·) := (·, i) for i  {0, 1}. Since µ is -dependent, so are 0 and 1. Define
2
G() := (0() - 1()) cos() sin() d, (18)
0
which is set up in such a way that the integrand is positive for all   [0, 2), and thus G > 0. From [149, Lemma 3.3] one obtains the following cases:
(I) If  < G(), then Ppdl = 0.
(II) If  > G(), then Ppdl = 1.
There are explicit formulae for 0 and 1 [149]. Together with (18), this yields a reasonably explicit representation for the threshold function G that is in principle amenable to asymptotic analysis.
If  = 0,  > 0, the process X alternately moves along lines parallel to the x-axis and lines parallel to the y-axis.

FIG. 19: Classification diagram with respect to the property Ppdl. The two regions (I) and (II) correspond to the cases (I) (stable) and (II) (unstable). The blue curve separating the regions (I) and (II) represents the graph of G. On the -axis, the problem is not well-defined, which makes a classification impossible.

It is not hard to see that [149, Lemma 3.3] remains valid in this limiting case. Since G() > 0, one has Ppdl = 0.
If  = 0, the process X is not well-defined because the switching rates are infinite. It does, however, make sense to study the limiting behavior of the random dynamical system as   0. According to [149, Thm. 2.5], for  sufficiently small (with the required smallness depending on ), one has Ppdl = 1. This implies that lim0 G() = 0.
Finally, we examine the situation when  = 0 and   0. In the classification diagram in Figure 19, this corresponds to approaching the origin along the axis. By the averaging principle alluded to earlier [86, Thm. 2.1], the process X converges in probability, uniformly on compact time intervals, to the deterministic solution of the averaged problem

part. In this doubly singular situation, the previously

observed dichotomy is broken: For every x0 = 0, the trajectory of the solution to the averaged problem is

a periodic orbit, more precisely a circle of radius x0

centered at the origin.

As second example for a piecewise deterministic Markov process, we are going to use a logistic growth model with random switching. Just as our first example, this Markov process is characterized by random switching between two vector fields with a critical point in common. Unlike the first example, though, the vector fields share a compact trapping region of positive Lebesgue measure that gives rise to a nontrivial stationary distribution.
The logistic model is a classical model for the growth

15

of a population that is limited by the capacity of the environment to sustain the population. The model is described by the logistic differential equation x (t) = U(x(t), r, p), where

U(x, r, p) := rx(1 - x/p).

The time-dependent variable x represents the population size. The parameters r (the growth rate) and p (the carrying capacity) are assumed to be positive.
We consider the dynamical system induced by randomly switching between the logistic vector fields

u0(x) := U (x, , 1), u1(x) := U (x, 1, 2),

(Xpdp)

at switching rates 0 =  and 1 = 1. Notice the asymmetry in the switching rates that will lead to the system spending more and more time in the regime governed by u0 as  approaches 0. In [114], random switching between the vector fields U (·, p-, p-) and U (·, p+, p+) was studied in detail, for parameters p- < 0 and p+ > 0 to the left and to the right of the transcritical bifurcation at p = 0. Even though the present setting is somewhat different, we will follow [114] quite closely.
For r, p > 0, the logistic vector field U(·, r, p) has the equilibrium points 0 and p, which are unstable and asymptotically stable, respectively. Stability of 1 and 2 for u0 and u1 implies that the compact interval [1, 2] is positively invariant under the switching dynamics, i.e. every switching trajectory starting in [1, 2] stays in this interval for all positive times. Since, in addition, the Markov semigroup of (X, E) is Feller (see Proposition 2.1 in [20]), the Krylov­Bogoliubov method (Theorem 3.1.1 in [64]) yields the existence of a stationary distribution µ such that µ([1, 2] × {0, 1}) = 1. Moreover, by [9, Theorem 2] or by [20, Theorem 4.4], µ is the unique stationary distribution for (X, E) that assigns full measure to (0, ) × {0, 1}. Finally, again by [9, Theorem 2], µ is absolutely continuous with respect to the product of Lebesgue measure on (0, ) and counting measure on {0, 1}. Hence, µ admits a density  with respect to the latter measure.
For the invariant density 0(·) := (·, 0), we consider the property

Pbdd =

1, 0,

if 0 is bounded on (1, 2), if 0 is unbounded on (1, 2).

By [11, Thm. 1], 0 and 1 := (·, 1) are C smooth in the open interval (1, 2) because u0 and u1 are smooth vector fields with no equilibrium points in (1, 2). As a
result, the corresponding probability fluxes i := iui, i  {0, 1}, satisfy the Fokker­Planck equations [85]

for positive normalizing constant c1 and c2. These formulae for 0 and 1 show that 1 is always bounded on (1, 2). Furthermore, the invariant density 0 has a singularity at the equilibrium point 1 of u0 if and only if  < . We obtain the following cases:

(I) If   , then Pbdd = 1.

(II) If  > , then Pbdd = 0.

FIG. 20: Classification diagram with respect to the property Pbdd. The two regions I and II correspond to the cases (I) (bounded) and (II) (unbounded). The blue ray separating the regions (I) and (II) belongs to region (I). The property is not well-defined on the axes.

This dichotomy admits the following heuristic explana-

tion: If  (the rate of switching away from the vector field

u0) is small compared to  (the contraction rate of u0 at its equilibrium point x = 1), then a large amount of prob-

abilistic mass accumulates in the vicinity of the equilib-

rium point; a singularity at x = 1 is formed. Conversely,

if  is large in comparison with , the system switches

sufficiently often away from u0 to prevent a strong accu-

mulation of probabilistic mass near x = 1; the invariant

density 0 stays bounded. In the singular case  = 0, no switching away from u0
takes place. The process (X, E) still has a unique station-

ary distribution on (0, ) × {0, 1}, namely the product

of the Dirac measure at x = 1 and the measure (1, 0)

on {0, 1}. Of course, this distribution no longer has a

probability density function with respect to the product

of Lebesgue measure on (0, ) and counting measure on

{0, 1}. It follows that the property Pbdd cannot be studied on the -axis.

If  = 0, the vector field u0 is constantly equal to zero. As long as  > 0, the system alternates between flowing

along u1 and staying put. The unique stationary distri-

bution on (0, ) × {0, 1} is then the product of the Dirac

measure at the equilibrium point x = 2 of the measure

(

,

)

on

{0, 1}.

Again,

Pbdd

cannot

studied. Finally, in the doubly singular case  =  = 0,

16

one obtains an infinite family of stationary distributions (µx)x>0, where µx is the product of the Dirac measure at x and the measure (1, 0) on {0, 1}.
For switching systems in dimension greater than one, the set of singularities of invariant densities can have a much richer structure than the one exhibited here (see [10] for a simple yet nontrivial example in 2D). This can result in more complex classification diagrams with respect to a suitably defined version of Pbdd.
We conclude this subsection with some remarks on the two examples presented above. We also hint at additional topics in the field of piecewise deterministic processes where double limits may be fruitfully studied.
In the first example, we saw that switching between vector fields of a certain kind (stable, in our example) can result in a dynamical system of a very different kind (unstable). In the same vein, for a Lotka­Volterra system of two competing species, it is shown in [24] that switching between two environments that both favor the same species can even lead to the extinction of this species. The articles [24], [165], and [164] together provide a clear picture of which parameter choice results in which longterm behavior for the Lotka­Volterra system. It is thus possible to represent the interplay of the parameters by a double-limit diagram.
The boundedness property for invariant densities is straightforward to study for piecewise deterministic processes of spatial dimension one [11]. In higher dimensions, a regularity theory for invariant densities is still missing. However, the double-limits framework developed in this article can also be meaningfully applied to other ergodic properties, e.g. the number of stationary distributions, absolute continuity of stationary distributions with respect to a suitable reference measure, or exponential ergodicity. When it comes to the number of stationary distributions, an essential tool is the theory of stochastic persistence [18], which gives criteria for the existence of a stationary distribution on the complement of an invariant closed subset of the phase space (the extinction set). In [23] and [200], this theory ­ originally devised for Markov processes in general ­ has been further developed in the context of piecewise deterministic processes.
In general, there is a lack of precise necessary conditions for absolute continuity and exponential ergodicity of the stationary distribution. Besides, neither of these properties is affected by the rates of switching, which makes it imperative to link both of the small parameters  and  to the vector fields in order to obtain a nontrivial double-limit diagram. Apart from [20] and [9], absolute continuity for piecewise deterministic processes was studied for instance in [63] and [161], where the process X is allowed to have jumps. Sufficient conditions for exponential ergodicity in total-variation distance were given in [20], [153], and [21]; and for exponential ergodicity in Wasserstein distance in [22] and [58].
Other types of switching processes have been studied in the literature, some of them abundantly: switch-

ing between PDEs [150], non-Markovian switching [154], switching between diffusions [217], etc. All of these classes of stochastic processes are amenable to the double-limit approach proposed in this article.
We have already seen in the current context, that one expects double limit problems for stochastic systems to be directly linked to double limits for Fokker­Planck (or Kolmogorov) equations. We shall now continue with this theme and focus in the next two subsections on problems arising from various classes of partial differential equations (PDEs).

3.5. Matched Asymptotic Expansions & BVPs

Two-parameter singularly perturbed systems of differential equations have been widely studied from the analytical as well as from the numerical viewpoint (see [57, 95, 103, 130, 179, 183, 184, 192, 206, 210] and references therein). In most cases, the singularity is attributed to the presence of small parameters in front of the derivative terms; however, as shown in [190], this is not a necessary condition. This also applies to the problem presented in this section.
We start with a PDE problem, which still naturally links to ODEs and classical double limit fast-slow systems. We consider the following boundary value problem:



2

uXX = (1 + u)2 1 - (1 + u)2 ,

u = 0,

X  [-1, 1], (Xmes)
X = 1.

Equation (Xmes) describes the steady states associated to a second-order parabolic PDE problem arising in the context of Micro-Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) [160]. In particular, the function u(X) represents the deflection of an elastic membrane towards a ground plate under the action of an electric potential described by the parameter  > 0, while 0 <  1 appears as a regularization parameter.
The bifurcation diagram associated to (Xmes) consists of two branches of stable equilibria separated by a third, intermediate branch of unstable equilibria (see Figure 21a). The middle and upper branch meet at a saddlenode bifurcation point (). A steady-state solution exists for every  > 0, and the presence of the regularizing -dependent term in (Xmes) guarantees that for any  the solution is bounded below by u = -1 + ; see Figure 21b.
In [160], the authors have studied (Xmes) both analytically, using matched asymptotic expansions to construct solutions, and numerically, investigating the structure of the -dependent bifurcation diagram. However, the analytical motivation behind logarithmic switchback terms in the expansions, as well as a detailed resolution of the bifurcation diagram for very small values of , were left as challenging open questions. In [119], a detailed asymptotic resolution of 21a, both in the singular limit of  = 0

and for  positive and sufficiently small, is accomplished through separate investigation of three distinct, yet overlapping, regions in the diagram, allowing us to tackle these questions.
To that end, we first reformulate the boundary value problem (Xmes) in a dynamical systems framework; then, identification of two main parameters in the resulting equations yields a two-parameter singular perturbation problem. Careful asymptotic analysis of that problem allows us to identify the corresponding limiting solutions, and to show how the third branch in the diagram found for non-zero  emerges from the singular limit of  = 0, where only the lower and the middle branch are present. On that basis, we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions close to these limiting solutions.
We reformulate (Xmes) as a first-order system by relabeling u with x, introducing the variable y = xX , and appending the trivial dynamics for the spatial variable X, which we relabel as , and . Moreover, we desingularize the flow near x = -1 and define a shift in x via x~ = 1+x, which translates the singularity to x~ = 0. Omitting the tilde and denoting differentiation with respect to the new independent variable by a prime, we obtain

x = x4y, y = (x2 - 2),  = x4,  = 0,

(20a) (20b) (20c) (20d)

S0 = (0, y, , 0) y  R,   R .

(21)

 = x4,  = 0.

(24c) (24d)

We observe that (24) is a fast-slow system, where x is fast and y is slow. The nature of , however, depends on : in particular,  is fast when  = O(1), and it is slow when  = O(). For  = 0, the manifolds S0 and M0 represent two branches of the critical manifold for (24). Since S0 is not normally hyperbolic, and the reduced flow on it is highly degenerate, one can apply the blow-up method to describe the dynamics of (24) in its vicinity [77, 78, 141]. Such method has proved to be particularly useful when tackling two-parameter perturbed systems [137, 170]. To this aim, we introduce the following blow-up transformation:

x = r¯x¯, y = y¯,  = ¯, and  = r¯¯,

(25)

where (y¯, ¯)  R2 and (x¯, ¯)  S1, i.e., x¯2 + ¯2 = 1. The vector field induced by (25) on the cylindrical manifold in (x¯, y¯, ¯, ¯, r¯)-space is best described in coordinate charts;
in particular, to carry out our analysis we require the two
following charts:

K1 : (x, y, , ) = (r1, y1, 1, r11), K2 : (x, y, , ) = (r2x2, y2, 2, r2).

(26a) (26b)

We note that the phase-directional chart K1 describes the "outer" regime, which corresponds to the transient from x = 1 to x = 0 approaching S0, while the rescaling
chart K2 covers the "inner" regime where x  0, in the context of (24). The corresponding dynamics are given
by

In order to construct singular solutions, we define the entry and exit sections in K1

When  = 0, there is an additional manifold of equilibria for (20a)-(20b) given by

i1n := (, y1, 1, 1) y1  [y-, y+],

(28)

1  [-, +], 1  [0, ]} ,

M0 := (x, 0, , 0) x  R+,   R .

(22)

As it turns out, in two of the three regions we investigate

o1ut := (r1, y1, 1, ) r1  [0, ],

(29)

y1  [y-, y+], 1  [-, +]} ,

18

where 0 <  < 1 and 0 <  < 1 are appropriately defined

constants, while y and  are real constants, with y- <

- 2
3

and

y+

>

2 .
3

Translating o1ut in terms of K2-

coordinates, we obtain the section

i2n := (-1, y2, 2, r2) y2  [y-, y+],

(30)

2  [-, +], r2  [0, ]} .

In terms of matched asymptotics, such sections describe
the transition between outer and inner regions. In par-
ticular, the outer regime corresponds to the area limited by i1n and o1ut in K1, while the inner regime is limited by i2n and the hyperplane {y = 0} in K2.
Solutions to (Xmes) arise as perturbations of singular solutions obtained in the limit of  = 0. Such solutions
are constructed by analyzing the dynamics in charts K1 and K2 separately in the limit as   0. In particular, solutions are constructed via two strategies:

Strategy 1. We consider two sets of boundary conditions, corresponding to suitable intervals of yvalues that are defined at  = -1 and  = 1, respectively. Flowing these two sets of boundary conditions forward and backward, respectively, we verify the transversality of the intersection of the two resulting manifolds at  = 0. Each initial y-value y0 for which these two manifolds intersect gives a solution to the boundary value problem (Xmes).

Strategy 2. Since all such solutions are even, we can focus our attention on the -interval [-1, 0], with boundary conditions x(-1) = 1 and y(0) = 0. The set of initial conditions at  = -1 and x = 1, but with arbitrary initial y-value y0, is then tracked forward up to the hyperplane {y = 0}. The resulting manifold is naturally parametrized by x(y, , , y0) and (y, , , y0); the unique "correct" value y0(, ) corresponding to a solution to (Xmes) is then obtained by solving (y0, , ) = 0 under the constraint that y(y0, , ) = 0.
We distinguish three types of singular solutions to (Xmes) (see Figure 22):

Type M1. Solutions of type M1 (indicated in blue in the following figures) satisfy x = 0 for X  I, where I is an interval centered at X = 0. They occur in two subtypes: the ones corresponding to  = O() have constant finite slope w outside of I, while the ones corresponding to  = O(1) vanish on I = (-1, 1).

Type M2. Solutions of type M2 (indicated in green) are those of slope y  1. These solutions reach {x = 0} at one point only, namely at X = 0.

Type M3. Solutions of type M3 (indicated in black) never reach {x = 0}.

For  = 0, the upper branch reduces to the union of a vertical part B1, corresponding to  = O(), and a horizontal part B2 which corresponds to  = O(1).

Pss := singular solutions of (24) exist. (32)

In Regime (I), such property is satisfied and singular solutions of type M1 and M2 exist, whereas in Regime (IV ) there are no singular solutions. Two special cases are represented by Regime (II) (corresponding to B1), where singular solutions of type I exist, and Regime (III) (corresponding to B2  B3), where we recover singular solutions of type M1 and M3.

orbit of type M1 with very singular structure, as shown

in 22b. Hence, the whole line B2 corresponds to that one singular solution.

In R1, we construct singular solutions and show their persistence for  > 0 small, using Strategy 1 as follows.

the presence of a saddle-node equilibrium for the (x2, y2)-

subsystem in chart K2 at (1, 0), on which the reduced

flow w.r.t. 2 occurs, allows us to determine the unique,

correct boundary value for y at  = -1 by following

the stable manifold of such equilibrium, which does not

depend on  and does therefore not change for  > 0, backwards until i2n = o1ut, and then tracking the flow in chart K1 backwards until 1 = -1. The intrinsic sym-
metry of the problem allows us to apply the same argu-

ment to the right part of the orbit, tracking the unstable

manifold of the equilibrium (x2, y2) = (1, 0) and following the flow in chart K1 until 1 = 1. When 0   < ^,
the proof is analogous except for the fact that we must

19

rescale  = ~ and obtain a slower reduced flow. The

assumption that  < 2 ensures a non-trivial slow drift
3
(i.e. the portion of the orbit where x = 0 does not re-

duce to a point), which allows us to apply the Exchange

Lemma to infer persistence of solutions for 0 <  1.

For

1,

i.e. in R2, we show the exis-

tence of two unique type M1 and type M2 solutions

which coincide when  = 2 . The proof consists of
3

two parts: we first consider a small neighborhood of



=

2 ,
3

i.e.

of



=

3 4

,

where

the

saddle-node

bifur-

cation occurs. We define a suitable bifurcation equation,

which describes the transition from solutions which limit

on type M1-solutions to those which limit on solutions

of type M2. Such equation is constructed by imposing

that 2(y0, , ) = 0 when y(y0, , ) = 0, i.e. using Strategy 2. Based on that equation, we infer the presence

of the saddle-node bifurcation, and we calculate the ex-

pansion of the corresponding -value . This expansion presents logarithmic switchback terms due to both a res-

onance phenomenon in chart K1 and the passage close to the saddle point (x2, y2) = (1, 0). In a second step, we consider the branch of solutions that limit on type

M2-solutions for the remaining values of  in R2. That branch is then shown to connect to solutions that are

covered by region R3, for which  = 0. In that case, the type M2-solution constructed in R2 collapses onto the line {y1 = 0}, which leads to singular dynamics in K1. Since such singular nature is due to the w-rescaling introduced to obtain System (24), this regime is better

studied using System (20) and replacing  = 2. Since

this region contains a neighborhood of (, ) = (0, 0), we

must perform an additional blow-up of (u, ) = (0, 0)

and split R3 into two sub-regions: for   [~, ] with ~ > 0 and  = 0, we can show the existence of a unique

singular solution of type M3 which perturbs regularly

when 0 < 

1 (in particular  

1 3

in R3).

When

  [0, ~], i.e. when R3 and R2 overlap, we have a sin-

gular solution of type M2 as   0, and of type M3 as

  0.

In summary, even unfolding a rather innocent-looking PDE problem via spatial dynamics in one dimension leads to a highly interesting double limit problem. In the next section, we continue this theme and consider a multi-component stationary PDE problem.

3.6. Fast Reaction Limits
A variety of biological and ecological phenomena present different intrinsic time-scales, and typically some processes are faster than others. The singular limit, or fast reaction limit, expresses the fact that instantaneous dynamics is also included in the system. For instance, in a population, there can be a dichotomy of two groups, and switching between them may be possible. Compared to other interactions, the switch may seem instantaneous

and give rise to interesting effects such as an aggregation of individuals or a population density pressure [54, 105]. Fast reaction limits have also been studied in other contexts, such as reversible and irreversible chemical reactions [49, 50], bacteria proliferation [104], proteins localisation in stem cell division [102], but also to model the Neolithic spread of farmers in Europe [79, 80].
In the context of predator­prey interactions, the expression of widely used functional responses can also come out of a systematic process in which one starts with a system of more than two equations with simple reaction terms and performs one [28, 113, 151, 168] or more limits [70, 93].
We consider here the cross-diffusion system, known as Shigesada­Kawasaki­Teramoto (SKT) model [196], proposed to account for stable inhomogeneous steady states exhibiting spatial segregation between two species competing for resources. We refer to [53, 146] and references therein for more details. The system is given by

tu - x ((d1 + d12v)u) = f (u, v)u, tv - x ((d2 + d21u)v) = g(u, v)v,

(33)

endowed with initial conditions and homogeneous

Neumann boundary conditions.

The quanti-

ties u(t, x), v(t, x)  0 represent the population

densities of two species at time t and position x,

confined on a bounded and connected domain   RN .

The movements of the individuals on the domain are de-

scribed by non-linear cross-diffusion terms: the positive

coefficients d1, d2 refer to the (standard) diffusion, while

the non-negative cross-diffusion coefficients d12, d21 stand for competition pressure. The reaction terms

describe the growth and the interaction of the two

species, where

f (u, v) = r1 - a1u - b1v, g(u, v) = r2 - b2u - a2v,

(34)

with the non-negative coefficients ri, ai, bi (i = 1, 2) being the intrinsic growth, the intra-specific competition and the inter-specific competition rates.
Model (33) falls into the class of quasilinear parabolic systems for which even the existence problem of solutions is not trivial. When d21 = 0 (triangular crossdiffusion system), it has been shown [116, 121] that the solutions of (33) can be approximated in a finite time interval by those of a three-component reaction­diffusion system if the solutions are bounded and provided that a suitable parameter is small enough. The rigorous proof of the convergence of solutions of the three-component reaction­diffusion system towards the solutions of a triangular cross-diffusion systems of two equations has been initially given in dimension N = 1 [59], and later generalized to a wider set of admissible reaction terms and in any dimension [71].
The convergence of the stationary steady states of the fast-reaction systems towards the ones of the crossdiffusion system has been also investigated by looking

at bifurcation diagrams with respect to different bifurcation parameters [121, 146]. In particular, it has been observed that the bifurcation structure of the fast-reaction expands and converges as the time scale parameter becomes smaller, sometimes going through major qualitative changes.
When d21 > 0, the full cross-diffusion system (33) can be obtained, at least formally, as the singularlimit of a four-component fast-reaction system involving two small time scale parameters , . In this case both species are split into quiet and active states, denoted by u1, v1 and u2, v2 respectively. Hence, we have that u := u1 + u2, v := v1 + v2. The resulting reaction­ diffusion system is

together with initial conditions and homogeneous Neu-
mann boundary conditions. Active states are supposed
to have a larger diffusion coefficient than the correspond-
ing quiet state. In particular, we assume that the diffusion coefficients of the active states are given by d^1 := d1 +d12M2 and d^2 := d2 +d21M2, where M1, M2 are positive constants such that 0  u(t, x)  M1, M1  r1/a1 and 0  v(t, x)  M2, M2  r2/a2 in R × .

while the time scale parameters ,  describe that the switch between the two different states happens much faster than the other processes.
At a formal level, when   0, system (Xfr) reduces to an intermediate three-component reaction­ cross-diffusion system in the variables u, v1, v2. The equation for u represents cross-diffusion, while the other time scale parameter  is still present in the equations for v1, v2. Letting   0, the intermediate threecomponent system reduces to the full cross-diffusion system. The same considerations hold if we let   0 first, and   0. In the time scale parameter plane (Figure 25), the first quadrant corresponds to the four-equation system (Xfr). The -axis corresponds to the reduced system with three equations for u1, u2, v, being the last equation with cross-diffusion. The -axis corresponds to the reduced system with three equations for u, v1, v2, being the first equation with cross-diffusion. Finally, the origin corresponds to system (33) with two cross-diffusion equations.

the four-component reaction­diffusion systems to the solutions of the full cross-diffusion system. From a numerical point of view, despite a greater number of equations, the structure of system (Xfr) is simpler than the crossdiffusion system (33), since it presents standard diffusion terms. For suitable small values of the time scale parameters ,  that leads to a "good" approximation of the cross-diffusion system (33), the four-component fastreaction system tends to be more tractable. In order to establish how accurate is the approximation, we look at the bifurcation structure of stationary solutions when ,  become small.
On the one hand, system (33) admits the homogeneous coexistence state (u, v) where

u

=

r1a2 a1a2

- r2b1 , - b1b2

v

=

r2a1 a1a2

- r1b2 , - b1b2

which is positive for suitable parameter values (see [53, 146]). It is known that the homogeneous solution undergoes some bifurcations under parameter variation, and branches of non-homogeneous solutions originate at these bifurcation points which correspond to different spatial distributions (patterns) of the species on the domain.
On the other hand, also system (Xfr) admits the homogeneous coexistence state (u1, u2, v1, v2), given by

u1 = u v1 = v

and the position of the bifurcation points on the homogeneous branch, and hence the global bifurcation structure, changes depending on the time scale parameters. Then, we say that the cross-diffusion system (33) and the fourcomponent fast-reaction system (Xfr) are equivalent if they have the same property
Pfr := number of bifurcation points on the homogeneous branch w.r.t. the bifurcation parameter.
In the following, we select a set of parameters already used in [53] and reported in Table I. It corresponds to the strong competition case a1a2 - b1b2 < 0, in which the homogeneous coexistence state is unstable in absence of diffusion. However, stable non-homogeneous solutions arise on branches originating from bifurcation points on the homogeneous branch. In Figures 26a­26e we show different bifurcation diagrams obtained for smaller values of the parameters , , considering r1 as bifurcation parameter and fixing the other parameter values, while Figure 26f corresponds to the non-triangular cross-diffusion system (33).
As shown in Figure 26, considering the parameter set in Table I, we have that Pfr = 2, 4. In Figure 27 the qualitative classification diagram of system (Xfr) with respect to the property Pfr in the -plane is shown. The -plane can be split into two regions. Note also that in general the -diagram is not symmetric with respect to the diagonal  = , but the intersections of the separation curves with the axis depend on the parameter set, in particular on the cross-diffusion coefficients. With different parameter sets, mainly with smaller standard diffusion coefficients d, one can obtain more bifurcation points on the homogeneous branch, and more zones in the -plane, but its structure remains qualitatively similar to Figure 27.
The same study can be performed for other fastreaction systems with multiple time scales and their cross-diffusion limits [60, 70].
3.7. Coupled Oscillators
As the last example, we proceed to systems on networks. As discussed above, the presence of multiple time scales can lead to oscillations that are relevant in a variety of physical contexts; whether it is simple relaxation oscillations [94], mixed mode oscillations [68], or other examples of oscillatory deterministic dynamics discussed

in Sections 3.1 and 3.3. However, it is not only the oscillations themselves but also the interaction between different oscillatory processes that play an important role in many physical systems: These range from Huygens' synchronizing clocks [115] to coupled oscillatory dynamics in neuroscience [7, 109]. From a mathematical perspective, such systems can be understood as networks of coupled oscillators. In isolation, each node oscillator has state z  Rd whose evolution is determined by a smooth ODE

z := z = F (z)

(36)

that gives rise to an asymptotically stable limit cycle   Rd. In a network, nodes interact non-trivially if there is an edge between the two nodes. Despite the dynamics of each node being fairly simple, the network dynamics, namely the dynamics of joint state of all nodes in the network, can be rich. While synchronization is

probably one of the best understood dynamical phenomena in networks of coupled oscillators [40, 188, 201], even networks consisting of just a few fully symmetric nodes can give rise to complicated dynamics [39]. The network dynamics depend on both the intrinsic dynamical properties of each node and the network interactions. Here we will consider networks of weakly coupled relaxation oscillators, which have two small parameters: The time scale separation  as an intrinsic property of the oscillators themselves and the coupling constant  that is small by the assumption of weak coupling.
A network of N identical all-to-all coupled oscillators consists of N copies of (36) whose states zk  Rd, k  {1, . . . N }, evolve according to

N

zk = F (zk) + N H(zj, zk),

(37)

j=1

where H is a smooth interaction function and  the cou-
pling strength. If the coupling is weak, then the dynamics of this system on RNd can be reduced to a lowerdimensional system [5]: If  = 0 then (37) has a normally hyperbolic invariant torus N which persists for small
coupling [109]. Specifically, there exists an 0 > 0 such that for any  < 0 the system (37) has an attracting normally hyperbolic invariant torus T as a perturbation of N  RNd. In the following assume that 0 is maximal with this property; note that, depending on H, this
may allow for 0 = , for example, for trivial coupling H = 0. The dynamics of (37) reduce to the interaction
of N circular phase variables that evolve on T, a phase oscillator network. The dynamics on the invariant torus
are typically referred to as a phase reduction of (37);
cf. [176, 187] for more details on how to compute these.
While a phase reduction is possible for any smooth os-
cillator, in many contexts the oscillators have particular

23

properties. Relaxation oscillators are characterized by two time scales leading to a combination of slow quasistatic and fast transitions. The most famous examples include the van der Pol oscillator [207] and FitzHugh­ Nagumo oscillator [89, 175]. Consider a planar system (36) with state z = (x, y) that evolves according to

x = f (x, y) y = g(x, y)

(38a) (38b)

where f, g : R2  R are smooth and  > 0 is the time scale separation of the fast variable x and the slow variable y. Now assume that (38) gives rise to a family of relaxation oscillators, that is there is a family of asymptotically stable limit cycles   R2 that converge in the limit   0 to a union of orbit segments consisting of part of the critical manifold {(x, y) | f (x, y) = 0} and line segments that correspond to the fast transitions.
In a series of papers [136, 198], Somers and Kopell developed a theory to explain rapid synchronization in networks of coupled relaxation oscillators motivated by computational neuroscience. Write zk = (xk, yk) for the state of oscillator k which evolves according to (38) when uncoupled. The networks analyzed in [136, 198] include systems of the form

yk )

+

 N

yk = g(xk, yk),

N j=1

h(xj ,

xk ),

(Xnet)

for k  {1, . . . , N } and coupling function h without specific assumptions on the coupling strength . The analysis [136, 198] considers the singular limit   0 for network interactions such that the input from one node to the other is constant on each segment of the critical manifold and evaluates the "compression" of time it takes a singular trajectory to traverse segments of the critical manifold. But even in the context of coupled neurons, other forms of network interactions h--such as pulsatile coupling--are relevant.
If both the time scale separation  for the relaxation oscillator and the coupling strength  are small, then the qualitative dynamics of (Xnet) can be understood in terms of the unified framework above. Specifically, let Pnet denote the property that we can apply a phase reduction. We obtain a system of the form (37) by dividing the fast equations (Xnet) by  and setting  = /. By fixing  we obtain an 0() such that Pnet holds for all  < 0. Hence, there is 0() such that Pnet holds for  < 0() in (Xnet). This leads to the classification of the parameter space K into a region (I) where Pnet holds and its complement (II). Depending on the coupling function h, we may have lim0 0() = 0 (for example if h = 0 as mentioned above). However, for a generic interaction function one would expect 0() < C for some constant C. In this case, we have lim0 0() = 0 as depicted in Fig. 28.
Izhikevich [120] derived explicit expressions for the dynamics on the invariant torus in the relaxation limit. As

noted there, these expressions only describe the doubly singular limit for paths in parameter space converging to the limit point (, ) = (0, 0) that lie entirely within region (I). A first-order truncation of the phase dynamics-- as commonly considered--does not describe the dynamics of the full oscillator network (Xnet) for all points in (I) since higher-order terms may play a nontrivial role in the dynamics [38, 41, 152].
While we focused on the interplay of small parameter in the intrinsic oscillator dynamics and the network coupling, interacting small parameters also naturally arise in different ways in networked systems. In contrast to coupled relaxation oscillators, one can also consider the case of coupled oscillators close to a Hopf bifurcation where oscillations are almost sinusoidal. Considering both small bifurcation parameter and weak coupling, one obtains explicit phase reductions [8] that can--depending on the order of the approximation--contain nonpairwise interaction terms as mentioned above. Limits involving multiple small parameters also occur if the network connections are adaptive [96]. This includes for example networks of neurons [61, 65, 166] or adaptation in epidemic networks [97]. Indeed, oscillator networks with adaptive interactions on have received renewed attention recently, whether the adaptation is slow (see e.g., [36, 132, 195]) or fast [6] relative to the oscillatory dynamics. However, there are only few approaches taking into account distinct time scales explicitly (cf. [125]) in particular when multiple small parameters interact. Thus, for adaptive networks with multiple time scales, the framework presented here may help classify the dynamics of such coupled oscillator networks.
4. COMPARISON
In Section 3, we have described a wide variety of doubly-singular limit problems arising in differential equations. Yet, from the different examples, several natural themes emerge for the future of multiple singular limit systems.

24

Property Types: We have seen various ways of defining properties P to obtain double limits which, however, share quite surprising similarities:
· Individual Pattern Classification: It turned out to be extremely useful to define P via important types of patterns, e.g., the number of solutions/roots of an algebraic equation in Section 2.1, the slow manifold shapes near the transcritical point as well as the oscillation patterns for the Olsen model in Section 3.1, the stochastic excitable patterns for FitzHugh­Nagumo in Section 3.2, the types of stationary patterns for MEMS in Section 3.5, and the number of bifurcation points for fast reaction PDEs in Section 3.6.
· Phase Space Structure: A strongly related class of properties emerges once one investigates patternforming properties more on a global level studying the entire phase space at once. Examples are probabilistic quantifiers such as escape probabilities in Section 3.2, the sign of the first Lyapunov exponent in Section 3.3 for oscillators with shear, or the global stability for linear PDMPs in Section 3.4.
· Mathematical Features: A last important class of properties has emerged corresponding to elements of proofs or mathematical properties. This includes convexity from Section 2.1, the exchange of partial derivatives in Section 2.2, the existence of a stationary distribution in Section 3.4, or the applicability of phase reduction for networks of oscillators in Section 3.7.
In view of all the preceding examples, it seems difficult to imagine that, for practical problems in singularly perturbed differential equations, there are highly useful properties that do not fit within the three classes mentioned above. In fact, we see that each class asks a different type of question, namely: How to understand individual/observed patterns? How to understand the global structure of phase space? What are the technical ingredients for proofs? Looking forward, it always seems useful directly at the start of a work on double- (or multiple-) limits to state carefully the major type of property one is interested in for dissecting the non-negative parameter cone K.
Diagram Structures: Even if one has obtained a suitable partitioning of K, one can now ask, comparing to other typical double limit problems, whether this partitioning via P is "typical" or "common"? Quite surprisingly, a cohesive and well-founded answer to this problem is possible as many common features seem to emerge in (, )  (0, 0) double-limit diagrams:
· Origin Ill-Posedness: Very frequently, it turns out that classifying the origin (, ) = (0, 0) is ill-posed as P is not well-defined or virtually impossible to evaluate at the origin. This situation is completely

satisfactory from an applied mathematical perspective as one has the small parameters in the problem as they are small, yet still non-zero; so we do not really lose major information if we exclude the origin in most problems.
· Special Axes: Another common theme is that the two axes { = 0,  > 0} { > 0,  = 0} have special or degenerate properties with respect to P. As for the origin, we do not give up much in many cases if we discard these two axes, yet it is often these two cases where proofs can become easier. Hence, it is often a suitable strategy to understand the axes, and then aim for a perturbation, homotopy, or extension of the results to the interior of the cone K.
· Polynomial Dissection: As expected from classical scaling law results in physics as well as from the mathematical viewpoint of singularity/regularity theory, we often find curves  = () (resp.  = ()) with (0) = 0 (resp. (0) = 0), which provide a partitioning of the cone K. Indeed, local Taylor (or H¨older-type) expansions should naturally appear, and one can then classify the partitioning of K via the critical powers/exponents of the leadingorder terms of the curves.
· Special Features: Certain problems, either due to their inherent natural problem formulation or due to dynamical effects, may lead to non-polynomial or otherwise special dissection. Examples are exponential terms arising in stochastic metastability as well as for canard problems, or curves without (0) = 0 as for fast-reaction bifurcation points.
In summary, it seems clear that a complete unifying classification is impossible but in many cases a rather exhaustive description can be provided within a common framework. First, one can aim to classify the behaviour on the axis for a single limit problem. Second, one can aim to obtain a set of (polynomial) curves partitioning the interior of K including the leading-order scaling exponents. Third, one aims to check whether there are any special cases occurring for the polynomial scaling or lack of connectivity of the curves to the origin; these special cases are then treated on a case-by-case basis and/or using a suitable shift or re-scaling to obtain polynomial order and/or connecting curves.
Mathematical Techniques: Another important lesson from the comparison of the different examples of doubly-singularly perturbed problems is that the analytical and numerical techniques tend to look very different at first sight. Yet, this seems to be a superficial view if one delves deeper into each methodology. There are many common themes appearing. First, numerical methods tend to become more "stiff" near singular limits, yet analytical methods become far more feasible the closer we are to the origin within K. This implies that a

25

natural approach is to combine both approaches within K by locally using analytical techniques and then extend the results beyond a small neighborhood of (, ) = (0, 0) via numerical computations. Second, analytical methods are always based upon similar principles, regardless of the differential equation studied:
· Limit equations: In a simple limit with one parameter fixed, i.e., on the coordinate axes in the twoparameter plane, we can often obtain a reduced problem from which to start.
· Relative scaling: It frequently makes sense to assume the existence of a relative scaling  = () (resp.  = ()), which provides again oneparameter families of sub-problems lying on curves in the interior of K.
· Desingularization: It often makes sense via geometric desingularization such as blow-up, or just via purely algebraic scaling, to generate a more complicated differential equation, which better splits the relative scalings.
· Regularization: Some problems become significantly easier if another singular parameter is added, e.g., noise is well-known to regularize the dynamics in many instances. In fact, we have seen this effect for excitable systems as well as for stochastically perturbed limit cycles where a non-hyperbolic structure collapses.
In summary, also the mathematical techniques to attack very distant-looking singular perturbation problems are more deeply related than one might anticipate.
5. OUTLOOK
In this review, we have only been able to illustrate a more general framework for differential equations with multiple small parameters for certain classes of problems. It is evident that many important questions still remain. To illustrate the diversity of remaining problems, we present a few crucial questions that seem tractable within the next couple of decades:
(Q1) For many double-singular perturbations, multiple methodological approaches exist and we definitely need a better understanding how these approaches can be compared more directly in concrete doublelimit test problems. This approach is very common in other mathematical disciplines, e.g., in numerical analysis, which often provides sharp and precise comparisons of algorithms, or even in classical analysis, where many problems involve the derivation of best-possible upper a-priori bounds. As a concrete example for the case of double limits, consider the case of multiple time scale stochastic problems discussed in Section 3.2. We have

shown a sample-paths approach to estimate probabilities, but alternatively one could also use a distributional approach via the Fokker-Planck equation, non-autonomous dynamics techniques such as skew-product flows, quasi-stationary distributions, matched asymptotic expansions, numerical methods, as well as many other methods to study the double limit. The same remark applies to all other examples we have discussed. A detailed discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of every method for double limits is clearly an open problem.
(Q2) For many double-limit problems, there are concrete conjectures left to be proven for certain regions in the two-parameter diagrams. A good example is the Olsen model in Section 3.1, where the case of non-classical relaxation oscillations is solved. Yet, rigorous proofs for mixed-mode/bursting-type oscillations as well as chaotic dynamics are missing although the geometry of the orbits has been illuminated well via singular limits as well as via numerics. This is actually a common theme for all the problems, i.e., even though certain scaling regimes are tractable, it is often extremely challenging to cover the entire parameter space via rigorous proofs. An excellent goal for future research could be to develop better first-principles mathematical indicators, which tell us much quicker about the difficulties of certain scaling regions. Currently, trialand-error is still often our best approach in this regard.
(Q3) Another natural question to follow within future work is the role played by low regularity in singularperturbation problems. An astonishing variety of small-parameter problems in differential equations are connected to trajectories, which may have low regularity. Beyond this, even the important dynamical invariant structures (such as attractors) have low regularity. One example has been presented in Section 3.3, as shear-induced chaos for stochastic differential equations is connected to relatively rough individual sample paths and simultaneously to a chaotic attractor. Since chaotic attractors often have fractal dimension, they contribute another aspect of low regularity. In more generality, the same theme also appears for chaotic deterministic switching problems or in a completely different setting in large-scale network limits, where the regularity of the finite-dimensional problem may not always transfer to the mean-field or continuum limit.
(Q4) From a numerical perspective, many crucial challenges are posed by double-limit dynamics. In fact, even very classical stiff differential equations with a single small parameter constitute a vast area already. Having two different, yet possibly

26

connected, singular parameters tends to make the situation much worse. It seems wise to combine analytical pre-processing, i.e., re-writing the differential equations first into the best possible numerical problem, and careful a-priori error estimates, to avoid spurious solutions. A good example of re-writing the numerical setting has been discussed in Section 3.6, where numerical continuation in the small parameters leads to well-conditioned boundary-value problems instead of quite poorly conditioned initial-value problems. It is a very worthwhile general goal to develop as many numerical methods as possible that have robustness/wellconditioning against small-parameter limits.
(Q5) Another aspect where many open questions remain is the interplay between double limits and areas usually quite far from classical singular-limit problems for differential equations. An illustrating example are limits in coupled oscillators as discussed in Section 3.7. More generally, one can assume that the oscillators are coupled on a graph, on a simplicial complex, or a general hypergraph [13, 41]. In these cases, methods from graph theory, combinatorics, and geometry/topology are going to enter the mathematical challenge, and double-limit problems are not as classical in these areas as they are for differential equations. Yet, exploring whether it is possible to translate open questions in doublelimit problems into new areas seems to be promising.
(Q6) We have often assumed throughout this work that the studied differential equations have quite a high degree of regularity in their defining equations as this is often the most natural starting point, e.g., by invoking a more microscopic modelling approach to retain smoothness. Even in the case of SODEs with classical white noise, we have H¨older regularity in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. Only for the PDMP case in Section 3.4, we have less regularity as discontinuous jumps occur. Of course, if one allows for arbitrary degeneracy in terms of input regularity, then this leads already to very intriguing questions on the level of existence of a suitable dynamical system, even for ODEs [48, 162]. Already for ODEs the number of possibilities for bifurcations in non-smooth systems is extremely large [73, 126] and their unfoldings via multiple small parameters involving a regularization is still under active development [55, 127]. For non-smooth SDEs and PDEs, the situation will be even more complicated. In summary, identifying principles to derive universally valid and sufficiently low-dimensional doublelimit problems is already challenging once regularity assumptions are relaxed.
(Q7) The biggest, and probably even most pressing, remaining challenge is to broaden the practical applicability of double-limit results. In fact, the

steps (S1)­(S3) in the introduction naturally apply to many other problems. For example, doublelimit differential equations occur in homogenization of PDEs [167], in homogenization of fast chaos [163], in rate-independent systems modeling viscoelasticity [171], in bursting oscillations in neuroscience [203], in oscillators from systems biology [170], in plasma physics [76], in mean-field analysis of particle systems [45], in stochastic optimization [46], and in fluid dynamics [99]. Of course, this list could be continued with many additional fields.
Finally, we would like to point out that our general view on double-limit problems in differential equations might also have a general impact in several respects, not only within the areas of the examples we have presented, for the questions (Q1)-(Q7), but also well beyond:
· The diagram structure, which we have utilized to summarize the main results for each case, seems to be well-adapted to the basic case of two parameters but, using suitable projections, higher-dimensional generalizations are certainly conceivable.
· Although a complete classification of all possible scaling laws in all double-limit problems seems out of reach, a classification into generic cases via an abstract universality theory, analogous to critical exponents in physics, may very well exist.
· It seems very promising to consistently reconsider double-limit problems that might have looked too challenging in the past. With a more coherent data base and a more structured classification, one might be able to search for new methods in virtually any other doubly-singular limit problem.
