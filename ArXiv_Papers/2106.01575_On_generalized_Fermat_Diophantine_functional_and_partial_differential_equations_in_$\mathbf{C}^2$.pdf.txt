ON GENERALIZED FERMAT DIOPHANTINE FUNCTIONAL AND PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS IN C2
WEI CHEN, QI HAN,, QIONG WANG
Abstract. In this paper, we characterize meromorphic solutions f (z1, z2), g(z1, z2) to the generalized Fermat Diophantine functional equations h(z1, z2)f m + k(z1, z2)gn = 1 in C2 for integers m, n  2 and nonzero meromorphic functions h(z1, z2), k(z1, z2) in C2. Meromorphic solutions to associated partial differential equations are also studied.

1. Introduction

In 1995, Andrew Wiles [35, 33] finally proved the profound Fermat's Last Theorem, remained

open for over 350 years, which states, in a simple-looking form, that the equations an + bn = cn

have no positive integral solution if n  3. An equivalent form of this prestigious result is that

the equations xn + yn = 1 have no positive rational solution if n > 2.

It seems that Montel [28] in 1927 first studied the functional equations f n +gn = 1 analogous

to Fermat equations xn +yn = 1, and he observed that all entire solutions f, g must be constant

if n > 2; see also Jategaonkar [15]. Later work were proved by Baker [1] and Gross [8, 9], where

they showed that all meromorphic solutions to f n + gn = 1 must be constant if n > 3 and also

characterized associated nonconstant meromorphic solutions for n = 2, 3 in C.

Cartan [4] in 1933 first considered the Fermat Diophantine functional equations f m +gn = 1,

and he observed that all entire solutions f, g must be constant if mn > m + n; see also Section

4 of Gundersen and Hayman [10]. We are not aware of any earlier work after that, and it seems

to us Li [23, Section 4] in 2012 first investigated meromorphic solutions to f m + gn = 1, where

he derived that all meromorphic solutions must be constant if mn > max{2m + n, m + 2n} and

further analyzed associated nonconstant meromorphic solutions for the remaining cases, which

was recently complemented by Chen, Han and Liu [6, Proposition 1].

In a different context, Khavinson [16] in 1995 derived the first result on entire solutions u to

the classical 2d eikonal equation u2z1 + u2z2 = 1 in C2 and proved that u must be affine; see also Saleeby [29]. Khavinson's work inspired several results such as Li [21], Hemmati [14], Saleeby

[30, 31] and Chen and Han [5, 11] on complex analytic solutions to variants of u2z1 + u2z2 = 1 in C2, and notably provided some insight to the work of Caffarelli and Crandall [3, Remark 2.3].

One may also consult Khavinson and Lundberg [18], and Khavinson [17].

The first order nonlinear partial differential equation u2z1 + u2z2 = 1 is a special form of the functional equation f 2 + g2 = 1 in C2 that admits of nonconstant complex analytic solutions

such as f = sin((z1, z2)) (entire) and f = sec((z1, z2)) (meromorphic) for an entire

g = cos((z1, z2))

g = i tan((z1, z2))

function (z1, z2) in C2. Noting that (uz1)z2 = (uz2)z1 for complex analytic functions, Li (with

Ye) in a series of papers [27, 22, 24] studied the conditions under which there is no nonconstant

meromorphic solution to the Fermat Diophantine functional equations f m +gn = 1 for m, n  2

in C2, and the condition that Z (fz2) = Z (gz1) counting multiplicities was identified with Z () denoting the zero set of a complex analytic function .
When a similar inquiry on the nonexistence of nonconstant meromorphic solutions to f m + gn = 1 for m, n  2 in C arises, Chen, Han and Liu [6, Theorem 4] recently provided (weaker) conditions such as Z (f ) = Z (g) ignoring multiplicities if m = n = 2, but Z (f )  Z (g) or
Z (g)  Z (f ) ignoring multiplicities if m, n  2 and (m, n) = (2, 2). Li [20, 25] studied the generalized Fermat Diophantine functional equations

h(z1)f m + k(z2)gn = 1

(1.1)

and proved the result below on associated complex analytic solutions f (z1, z2), g(z1, z2) in C2.

Theorem 1.1. Assume that h(z1), k(z2) are two nonzero meromorphic functions in C, and
m, n  2 are two integers. Then, one has the results as follows. (A) All meromorphic solutions f (z1, z2), g(z1, z2) to (1.1) in C2, with (m, n) = (2, 2), satisfy

T (r, f ) + T (r, g) = O(T (r, h) + T (r, k))

(1.2)

outside a set of r of finite Lebesgue measure, provided Z (fz2) = Z (gz1) ignoring multiplicities. (B) All entire solutions f (z1, z2), g(z1, z2) to (1.1) in C2, with m = n = 2, satisfy (1.2) again
outside a set of r of finite Lebesgue measure, provided Z (fz2) = Z (gz1) counting multiplicities.

If h(z1)  k(z2)  1, then all complex analytic solutions are reduced to constant, consistent with the proceeding work [27, 22, 24]. Nevertheless, the functions h(z1), k(z2) cannot be readily replaced by functions h(z1, z2), k(z1, z2) in C2 without modifying conditions. An example was given in [20, Remark 2.2], and below is another one very much akin to that.

Example.

One

has

h(z1, z2) =

, z12
z22

k(z1, z2) = z22,

f (z1, z2) =

z2 z1

sin z1

and

g(z1, z2) =

1 z2

cos z1

satisfying h(z1, z2)f 2 + k(z1, z2)g2 = 1 with Z (fz2) = Z (gz1) counting multiplicities, but the

estimate (1.2) apparently fails.

It is natural to seek conditions in which one can use h(z1, z2), k(z1, z2) in C2 as coefficients in (1.1) in place of h(z1), k(z2) in C. Li [23, Section 4] has already observed the estimate (1.2) for meromorphic solutions f (z1, z2), g(z1, z2) in C2 to

h(z1, z2)f m + k(z1, z2)gn = 1

(1.3)

when mn > max{2m + n, m + 2n}, and for entire solutions f (z1, z2), g(z1, z2) in C2 to (1.3) when mn > m + n, with no constraint on the zero sets Z (fz2), Z (gz1).
This paper, inspired by Li (with Ye, and Lu¨) [20, 27, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26], aims at recognizing conditions in which meromorphic solutions to (1.3) in C2 satisfy (1.2) for the remaining cases
of mn > max{2m + n, m + 2n}. We mainly focus on (m, n), (n, m) = (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3),
and also provide a general counterexample for the cases m = 1, n  2. Before to proceed, let F be the set of meromorphic functions f in C2 such that (, f ) > 0,
where (, f ) denotes a deficient value of f at ; see Hayman [12, Section 2.4]. Notice if f
is entire, then (, f ) = 1. So, all entire functions are members of F. Our main results of this paper can be formulated as follows.

Theorem 1.2. Assume that h(z1, z2), k(z1, z2) are two nonzero meromorphic functions in C2,
and m, n  2 are two integers. Then, one has the results as follows. (A) All meromorphic solutions f (z1, z2), g(z1, z2) to (1.3) in C2, with (m, n) = (2, 2), satisfy the estimate (1.2) outside a set of r of finite Lebesgue measure, provided

Z (hf m)z2 /(mhf m-1) = Z (kgn)z1 /(nkgn-1)

(1.4)

3

ignoring multiplicities. (B) All meromorphic solutions f (z1, z2), g(z1, z2) to (1.3) in C2, with m = n = 2, again satisfy
the estimate (1.2) outside a set of r of finite Lebesgue measure, provided

Z (hf 2)z2 /(2hf ) = Z (kg2)z1 /(2kg)

(1.5)

ignoring multiplicities and either f  F or g  F.

For m = 1, n  2 (or similarly for m  2, n = 1), one easily sees a family of counterexamples as follows.

Example. Assume h(z1, z2), k(z1, z2) are meromorphic functions while p(z1, z2) is a polynomial in C2. Then, the functions

f (z1, z2)

=

1 h(z1, z2)

-

k(z1 h(z1

, ,

z2) z2)

enp(z1

,z2

)

and

g(z1, z2)

=

ep(z1,z2)

satisfy h(z1, z2)f + k(z1, z2)gn = 1. Let, say, h(z1, z2) = k(z1, z2) = p(z1, z2) = z12 + 2z1z2 + z22 and observe that
Z (hf )z2 /h = Z (kgn)z1 /(nkgn-1)
counting multiplicities, but apparently (1.2) fails.

Corollary 1.3. All meromorphic solutions u(z1, z2) to the general 2d eikonal equations

um z1 + unz2 = 1,

(1.6)

with m, n  2, must be affine.

Remark. Corollary 1.3 (also) follows from Li [22, 27, 24, 25]. The condition (1.4) is not entirely new, which was first mentioned in [25] and used in [26] but only for entire solutions to (1.3) for m = n = 2; note that the inclusion condition in [26, Theorem 2.1] will not lead to its associated conclusions, and the issue comes from the analysis at lines 4-5 of its page 7.

In Section 2, we prove Theorem 1.2. In Section 3, we further discuss Theorem 1.2 (B) about

the family F, study an extension of Corollary 1.3 on the first order nonlinear partial differential

equations h(z1)um z1 + k(z2)unz2 = 1, and characterize entire solutions to the first order nonlinear partial differential equations h(z1)um z1 + k(z2)uz2 = 1 and h(z1)uz1 + k(z2)unz2 = 1 for m, n  2.
To prove our results, we will need Nevanlinna theory; see the classical monograph Stoll [32].

So, we assume the familiarity with the basics of this theory such as the characteristic function

T (r, f ), the proximity function m(r, f ), the counting functions N (r, f ) (counting multiplicities)

and N (r, f ) (ignoring multiplicities), and the first and second main theorems. S(r, f ) denotes

a quantity with S(r, f ) = o(T (r, f )) as r  + outside a set of r of finite Lebesgue measure.

Define

(, f )

:=

1 - lim sup
r

N (r,f ) T (r,f )

.

Set

div0f (0)

to

be

the

multiplicity

of

f

at

a

zero

0,

being

the smallest degree of the homogeneous polynomials appearing in the Taylor series expansion

of f around 0; as a common practice, write div0f (0) := + when f  0.

The problems studied in this paper are independent of Navanlinna theory. So, it is of great

interest to reprove the results here without involving this heavy machinery.

2. Proof of Theorem 1.2

Proof of Theorem 1.2 (A). Set U := hf m and V := kgn. Then, it follows from (1.3) that

U + V = 1,

and hence one has

Uzj + Vzj = 0

(2.1)

4

for j = 1, 2. Noticing

Uzj = hzj f m + mhf m-1fzj = f m-1(hzj f + mhfzj ) and Vzj = kzj gn + nkgn-1gzj = gn-1(kzj g + nkgzj ),

we define

P

:=

Fm f 2m

Gn g2n

for

F

:= hz2 f

+ mhfz2

=

Uz2 f m-1

and G := kz1 g + nkgz1

=

Vz1 gn-1

.

Using (1.3), we have

(2.2) (2.3)

mT (r, f ) = nT (r, g) + O(T (r, h) + T (r, k)).

(2.4)

Applying the lemma on logarithmic derivative (see Vitter [34], and Biancofiore and Stoll [2]), we deduce from (1.3) and (2.2)-(2.4) that

as clearly T (r, U ) = O(T (r, f ) + T (r, h)) and T (r, V ) = O(T (r, g) + T (r, k)).

Claim 1. P is holomorphic at each pole of f or g, which is neither a zero nor a pole of h, k and their partial derivatives. To prove this claim, we rewrite P as

P

Fm f 2m

hz2 f

n

= (hz2 f~ - mhf~z2)m(kz1 g~ - nkg~z1 )n

for

f~ :=

1 f

and

g~ :=

1 g

.

We

observe

from

(1.3)

that

a

pole



of

f

with

multiplicity

l,

which

is

neither a zero nor a pole of h, k and their partial derivatives, is also a pole of g with multiplicity

ml/n  1, an integer. Thus, we have

div0P ()  m(l - 1) + n ml/n - 1 = 2ml - m - n  0,

(2.6)

so that Claim 1 follows from (2.6) and a symmetric analysis on poles of g. Claim 2. At each zero of f or g, which is neither a zero nor a pole of h, k and their partial
derivatives, we have div0P (0)  1.
We shall only discuss on a zero 0 of f and consider two cases separately. (1) When div0f (0) = 1, then we know from the first equation in (2.2) that Uzj (0) = 0 with
multiplicity at least m - 1, which immediately leads to Vzj (0) = 0 with multiplicity at least m - 1 by (2.1). Noticing g(0) = 0 by (1.3) and recalling the hypothesis Z Uz2/(mhf m-1) = Z Vz1 /(nkgn-1) ignoring multiplicities, one derives that 0 must also be a zero of Uz2/f m-1; that is, 0 is a zero of F by definition. In view of (2.3), we have

div0P

div0F m (0)

div0f (0)

 m + n(m - 1) - 2m.

(2.7)

When n = 2, then our assumptions m  2 and (m, n) = (2, 2) yield m  3; so, (2.7) implies

div0P (0)  2(m - 1) - m = m - 2  1.

When n  3, then m  2 and it follows from (2.7) that

div0P (0)  3(m - 1) - m = 2m - 3  1.
(2) When div0f (0) = l  2, then we derive from the first equation in (2.2) that Uzj (0) = 0 with multiplicity at least (m - 1)l + l - 1 = ml - 1, which immediately yields Vzj (0) = 0 with multiplicity at least ml - 1 by (2.1). As g(0) = 0 by (1.3), we see from (2.3) that

div0P

div0F m (0)

 m(l - 1) + n(ml - 1) - 2ml.

(2.8)

When n = 2, then our assumptions m  2 and (m, n) = (2, 2) yield m  3; so, (2.8) implies div0P (0)  2(ml - 1) - ml - m = ml - m - 2  m(l - 1) - 2  1.
When n  3, then m  2 and it follows from (2.8) that div0P (0)  3(ml - 1) - ml - m = 2ml - m - 3  m(2l - 1) - 3  3.
So, Claim 2 follows from the preceding estimates and a symmetric analysis on zeros of g.

6

By virtue of (2.3) and Claims 1-2, it is easy to deduce that

N (r, P ) = O

N (r, h) + N

r,

1 h

+ N (r, k) + N

r,

1 k

 O(T (r, h) + T (r, k)),

which combined with (2.5) leads to

T (r, P )  S(r, f ) + S(r, g) + O(T (r, h) + T (r, k)).

(2.9)

When P  0, then we know from (2.3) that F G  0; therefore, either F  0 or G  0. Our hypothesis Z Uz2 /(mhf m-1) = Z Vz1 /(nkgn-1) yields F  G  0. Thus, Uz1 , Uz2 , Vz1 , Vz2 must all be identically equal to zero by (2.1), so that U = hf m and V = kgn both are constant,
which immediately leads to the conclusion of Theorem 1.2.
When P  0, then (1.3) and Nevanlinna's first and second main theorems yield

mT (r, f ) = T (r, f m) + O(1)  T (r, hf m) + T (r, h)

(2.11)

From Claim 2, we know from (2.4) and (2.9)-(2.11) that

2mT (r, f ) = mT (r, f ) + nT (r, g) + O(T (r, h) + T (r, k))

 N (r, f ) + N (r, g) + 2N

 2T (r, f ) + S(r, f ) + S(r, g) + O(T (r, h) + T (r, k)),

which together with the assumption m  2 yields the conclusion of Theorem 1.2.

Proof of Theorem 1.2 (B). Set U = hf 2 and V = kg2 to have (2.1)-(2.2) as before. Write

P1

:=

F2 f2

G2 g4

=

F2 f2

-

hF 2 - hf 2

G2 g2

(2.12)

for F = hz2 f + 2hfz2 = Uz2 /f and G = kz1 g + 2kgz1 = Vz1 /g as before. Now, utilize (1.3) to see

T (r, f ) = T (r, g) + O(T (r, h) + T (r, k)),

(2.13)

and apply the lemma on logarithmic derivative again, like in (2.5), to deduce that

m(r, P1) = S(r, f ) + S(r, g) + O(T (r, h) + T (r, k)).

(2.14)

7

Claim 1. P1 has a pole at each pole of f that is neither a zero nor a pole of h, k and their partial derivatives, with multiplicity at most 2. To prove this claim, rewrite P1 as

observe

from

(1.3)

that

a

pole



of

f

with

multiplicity

l,

which

is

neither a zero nor a pole of h, k and their partial derivatives, is also a pole of g with the same

multiplicity l. Thus, we have div0f~2P1 ()  4(l - 1)  0, so that div0P1 ()  4(l - 1) - 2l =

then

Because poles of f and g appear simultaneously, Claim 1 is thus proved.

Claim 2. We have

div0P1 (0)  2l

(2.15)

at each zero of f with multiplicity l, which is neither a zero nor a pole of h, k and their partial derivatives. We consider two cases separately.
(1) When div0f (0) = 1, then we know from the first equation in (2.2) that Uzj (0) = 0 with multiplicity at least 1, which then yields Vzj (0) = 0 with multiplicity at least 1 by (2.1). Since
g(0) = 0 via (1.3) and Z Uz2/f = Z Vz1 /g ignoring multiplicities via (1.5), 0 is a zero of F by definition. In view of (2.12), we have

div0P1 (0) = div0F 2 (0) + div0G2 (0) - div0f2 (0) = 2 div0Uz2 (0) + 2 div0Vz1 (0) - 2 div0f (0)  2.
f
(2) When div0f (0) = l  2, then we derive from the first equation in (2.2) that Uzj (0) = 0 with multiplicity at least 2l - 1, which immediately yields Vzj (0) = 0 with multiplicity at least 2l - 1 by (2.1). As g(0) = 0 by (1.3), we see from (2.12) that
div0P1 (0) = div0F 2 (0) + div0G2 (0) - div0f2 (0) = 2 div0Uz2 (0) + 2 div0Vz1 (0) - 2 div0f (0)
f
 2(l - 1) + 2(2l - 1) - 2l = 2l + 2(l - 2)  2l.

Claim 3. We have div0P1 (0)  0 at each zero of g that is neither a zero nor a pole of h, k and their partial derivatives. We consider two cases separately.
(1) When div0g(0) = 1, then we know from the first equation in (2.2) that Vzj (0) = 0 with multiplicity at least 1, which then yields Uzj (0) = 0 with multiplicity at least 1 by (2.1). Since
f (0) = 0 via (1.3) and Z Uz2/f = Z Vz1/g ignoring multiplicities via (1.5), 0 is a zero of G by definition. In view of (2.12), we have

div0P1 (0) = div0F 2 (0) + div0G2 (0) - 2 div0g2 (0) = 2 div0Uz2 (0) + 2 div0Vz1 (0) - 4 div0g(0)  0.

(2) When div0g(0) = l  2, then we derive from the first equation in (2.2) that Vzj (0) = 0 with multiplicity at least 2l - 1, which immediately yields Uzj (0) = 0 with multiplicity at least

8

2l - 1 by (2.1). As f (0) = 0 by (1.3), we see from (2.12) that
div0P1 (0) = div0F 2 (0) + div0G2 (0) - 2 div0g2 (0) = 2 div0Uz2 (0) + 2 div0Vz1 (0) - 4 div0g(0)
g
 2(2l - 1) + 2(l - 1) - 4l = 2(l - 2)  0.

By virtue of (2.12) and Claims 1-3, it is easily deduced that

N (r, P1)  2N (r, f ) + O(T (r, h) + T (r, k)).

(2.16)

When P1  0, then we observe from (2.12) that F G  0 again. So, U = hf 2 and V = kg2 are both constant as before, which yields the conclusion of Theorem 1.2.
When P1  0, then we have from the analysis in (2.5) and (2.13)-(2.16) that

2T (r, f ) = T

= m(r, P1) + N (r, P1) + S(r, f ) + S(r, g) + O(T (r, h) + T (r, k))

 2N (r, f ) + S(r, f ) + S(r, g) + O(T (r, h) + T (r, k)),

since

P

=

P1 f2

in

view

of

(2.3)

with

m=n=2

and

(2.12).

That

is,

T (r, f )  N (r, f ) + S(r, f ) + S(r, g) + O(T (r, h) + T (r, k))  (1 - (, f ))T (r, f ) + S(r, f ) + S(r, g) + O(T (r, h) + T (r, k));

(2.17)

in other words, recalling (, f )  1, we have

(, f )T (r, f ) = O(T (r, h) + T (r, k)),

(2.18)

which along with the condition (, f ) > 0 yields the conclusion of Theorem 1.2.

Remark. A careful check of the analysis in Claim 1 of the proof of Theorem 1.2 (B) indicates that one may only consider the simple poles of f , and thus weaken the condition (, f ) > 0 and enlarge the family F. On the other hand, as equation (1.3) with m = n yields the estimate (2.13) as well as
N (r, f ) = N (r, g) + O(T (r, h) + T (r, k)),
one can alternatively choose g  F in place of f  F in Theorem 1.2 (B).

3. Some extensions

First, recall a constraint on the poles of f (and automatically on those of g) was utilized to

have the estimate (1.2) in Theorem 1.2 (B). Now, we would like to replace this constraint by

a similar one. Denote by Fa the set of meromorphic functions f in C2 satisfying (a, f ) > 0

for

(a, f )

:=

1

-

lim sup
r

N

r,

f

1 -a

T (r,f 2)

. All entire functions are members of F = F.

Our first extension result is as follows regarding meromorphic solutions to

h(z1)f 2 + k(z1, z2)g2 = 1.

(3.1)

9

Theorem 3.1. Assume that h(z1)  0 is a meromorphic function in C, and k(z1, z2)  0 is a meromorphic function in C2. Then, all meromorphic solutions f (z1, z2), g(z1, z2) to equation (3.1) in C2 satisfy (1.2) outside a set of r of finite Lebesgue measure, provided
Z (fz2 ) = Z (kg2)z1 /(2kg) ignoring multiplicities and f  Fa for a finite number a = 0 with a2h  1.
We only outline the key steps of its proof, which resembles that of Theorem 1.2.

Proof. Set U = hf 2 and V = kg2 to have (2.1)-(2.2) as before. Write

Ha

:=

F2

=

f 2(f 2

F2 1 - hf 2

G2 g2

(3.2)

for F := 2hfz2 = Uz2 /f and G = kz1 g + 2kgz1 = Vz1 /g like before. We still have (2.13), and we apply the lemma on logarithmic derivative to get

m(r, Ha) = S(r, f ) + S(r, g) + O(T (r, h) + T (r, k)).

(3.3)

In

view of Ha =

P1 f 2-a2

by (2.12) and (3.2),

it

follows that

Claim 1. div0Ha (0)  2l at each zero of f with multiplicity l, which is neither a zero nor a pole of h, k and their partial derivatives;

Claim 2. div0Ha (0)  0 at each zero of g, which is not a zero of f 2 - a2, or equivalently not a zero of h - a-2, and which is neither a zero nor a pole of h, k and their partial derivatives.

In the sequel, we will consider the poles of Ha.

Claim 3. Ha is holomorphic at each pole of f or g that is neither a zero nor a pole of h, k

and their partial derivatives. To prove this claim, rewrite Ha as

Ha

=

F2

G2

f 2(f 2 - a2) g4

=

4h2f~z22 1 - a2f~2

(kz1

g~

-

2kg~z1

)2

for

f~ =

1 f

and

g~ =

1 g

.

We

observe

from

(3.1)

that

a

pole



of

f

with

multiplicity

l,

which

is

neither a zero nor a pole of h, k and their partial derivatives, is also a pole of g with the same

multiplicity l. Therefore, we have div0Ha ()  4(l - 1)  0. Because poles of f and g appear simultaneously, Claim 3 is thus proved.

Claim 4. Ha has a pole at each zero of f - a, which is not a zero of g, and which is neither

a zero nor a pole of h, k and their partial derivatives, with multiplicity at most 1. To have this

proved, we first note such a common zero of f - a and g is automatically a zero of h - a-2 by

(3.1). Now, let a be a zero of f - a with multiplicity l satisfying the given constraints. Then,

div0Ha (a)



2(l - 1) - l

=

l-2



0

if

l

 2;

if

l

=

1,

then

div01 (a) Ha

 1.

Analogous

analysis

leads to that Ha has a pole at each zero of f + a, which is not a zero of g, and which is neither

a zero nor a pole of h, k and their partial derivatives, with multiplicity at most 1.

By virtue of (3.1) and Claims 1-4, it is easy to have

When Ha  0, then U = hf 2 and V = kg2 are both constant, which leads to the conclusion of Theorem 1.2. When Ha  0, then like before one derives by (3.3)-(3.4) that

2T (r, f ) = T

T (r, f )  N

 (1 - (a, f ))T (r, f ) + S(r, f ) + S(r, g) + O(T (r, h) + T (r, k));

in other words, recalling (a, f )  1, we have (a, f )T (r, f ) = O(T (r, h) + T (r, k)),
which along with the condition (a, f ) > 0 yields the conclusion of Theorem 3.1.

(3.5)

It is straightforward to have an analogous result on meromorphic solutions to

h(z1, z2)f 2 + k(z2)g2 = 1.

(3.6)

Corollary 3.2. Assume that k(z2)  0 is a meromorphic function in C, and h(z1, z2)  0 is a meromorphic function in C2. Then, all meromorphic solutions f (z1, z2), g(z1, z2) to equation (3.6) in C2 satisfy (1.2) outside a set of r of finite Lebesgue measure, provided

Z (hf 2)z2 /(2hf ) = Z (gz1 ) ignoring multiplicities and g  Fa for a finite number a = 0 with a2k  1.

In the sequel, we consider an extension of Corollary 1.3 as follows.

Theorem 3.3. All meromorphic solutions u(z1, z2) to the general 2d eikonal equations

h(z1)um z1 + k(z2)unz2 = 1,

(3.7)

with m, n  2, satisfy the estimate (1.2) outside a set of r of finite Lebesgue measure. Thus, if h(z1), k(z2) are constant, then so are uz1, uz2; that is, u must be linear.

Proof. First, under the current assumption, one has

(hum z1 )z2 /(mhum z1-1) = uz1z2 = uz2z1 = (kunz2 )z1 /(nkuzn2-1);
as such, the conditions (1.4) and (1.5) are automatically satisfied. When m, n  2 but (m, n) = (2, 2), then nothing is needed for further analysis. In the case
where m = n = 2, let  be a pole of uz1 or uz2, which is neither a zero nor a pole of h, k and their derivatives. Then, using (3.7), one sees that  is a pole of both uz1 and uz2 of the same multiplicity, and thus a pole of u. So,  must be a multiple pole of both uz1 and uz2. Noting the remark at the end of Section 2, the function P1 by (2.12) (after replacing f, g by uz1, uz2, respectively) only has possible poles from those of h, k, and therefore in this case, the deficient value condition is automatically satisfied, which finishes the proof.

11

As we said earlier, when h, k are constant, Khavinson [16] in 1995 proved the first result on entire solutions to the 2d eikonal equation for m = n = 2, while Li [20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], with Ye and Lu¨, systemically studied its meromorphic solutions. In this aspect, our Theorem 3.3 supplements those known results and provides the first one on meromorphic solutions with function coefficients h, k, especially in the situation where m = n = 2.
Finally, we consider the relatively easier case of entire solutions to (3.7) when either m = 1 or n = 1. To proceed, we start with an example as follows.

Example.

The

entire

function

u(z1, z2) = ez12-z23 +

z12 2

+

z23 2

in

C2

is

a

solution

to

h(z1)uz1 + k(z2)uz2 = 1

for

meromorphic

functions

h(z1) =

1 2z1

and

k(z2) =

1 3z22

in

C.

Clearly,

(1.2)

fails.

The two results in the sequel partially extends the studies of Li [21, Corollary 2.7] (see also Khavinson [16] and Hemmati [14]) with function coefficients h(z1), k(z2).

Proposition 3.4. All entire solutions u(z1, z2) to the general 2d eikonal equations

h(z1)uz1 + k(z2)unz2 = 1,

(3.8)

satisfy the estimate (1.2) outside a set of r of finite Lebesgue measure for n > 2. On the other

hand, when n = 2 and if (1.2) fails, then we have the following conditions:

T (r, uz1 ) = T (r, uz1z1 ) + S(r, u) = 2T (r, uz2) + S(r, u) = 2T (r, uz1z2 ) + S(r, u) = 2T (r, uz2z2 ) + S(r, u)

(3.9)

and

T (r, uz2) = N

r,

1 uz2

+ S(r, u) = N

r,

1 uz2

+ S(r, u).

(3.10)

Proof. First, for every entire solution u to (3.8) in C2, recall a well-known fact (via the lemma on logarithmic derivative) that says

max{T (r, uz1), T (r, uz2)}  T (r, u) + S(r, u).
On the other hand, via Li [23, Theorem 3] based on Chuang [7] (for a detailed English presentation, see, for example, Theorem 4.1 of Yang [36]; interested reader may also refer to Hayman [13, Theorem 2]), one has, for some absolute constants  (> 1), c > 0,

T (r, u)  c max{T ( r, uz1), T ( r, uz2)} + O(log r). Note also, using (3.8), that

T (r, uz1) = nT (r, uz2) + O(T (r, h) + T (r, k)).

(3.11)

From now on, suppose the estimate (1.2) does not hold; in this case, in view of the preceding

estimates, it follows that

T (r, h), T (r, k) = S(r, u).

(3.12)

Next, take the partial derivative of z2 on both sides of (3.8) to get

h(z1)uz1z2 = {-k(z2)uz2 - nk(z2)uz2z2 }uzn2-1;

(3.13)

so, via Li [19, Section 4] (see also Hayman [12, Lemma 3.3]), we have

T (r, kuz2 + nkuz2z2 ) = S(r, u), and when n > 2, we additionally have

(3.14)

T (r, {kuz2 + nkuz2z2 }uz2 ) = S(r, u),

12

both combined implying T (r, uz2) = S(r, u), and thus T (r, u) = S(r, u) in view of (3.11)-(3.12) as well as the estimates in front of them, a contradiction. Therefore, when n > 2, the estimate (1.2) must hold outside a set of r of finite Lebesgue measure.
On the other hand, for n = 2, one only has (3.14), which along with (3.13) (that now writes h(z1)uz1z2 = {-k(z2)uz2 - 2k(z2)uz2z2 }uz2 ) and (3.12) further yields

T (r, uz2) = T (r, uz1z2 ) + S(r, u) = T (r, uz2z2 ) + S(r, u).

Now, take the partial derivative of z1 on both sides of (3.8) to get

h(z1)uz1 + h(z1)uz1z1 = -2k(z2)uz2 uz2z1 .

(3.15)

Let 0 = (1, 2) be a zero of uz2 of multiplicity l, with 1, 2 the associated coordinates in C, that is neither a zero nor a pole of h, k and their derivatives. So, one has uz1(0) = 1/h(1) = 0 by (3.8) and div0uz1z2 (0)  2l - 1 by (3.13). Substituting both into (3.15) yields

div0

by a slight abuse of notations. As a result, using (3.12) and (3.14), one observes

which together with (3.11) forces all inequalities to equalities; so, l = 1. Therefore, when n = 2 and if (1.2) fails, then we arrive at the conditions (3.9) and (3.10).

Corollary 3.5. All entire solutions u(z1, z2) to the general 2d eikonal equations

h(z1)um z1 + k(z2)uz2 = 1,

(3.16)

satisfy the estimate (1.2) outside a set of r of finite Lebesgue measure for m > 2. On the other hand, when m = 2 and if (1.2) fails, then we have the following conditions:

T (r, uz2 ) = T (r, uz2z2 ) + S(r, u) = 2T (r, uz1) + S(r, u) = 2T (r, uz1z1 ) + S(r, u) = 2T (r, uz1z2 ) + S(r, u)

(3.17)

and

T (r, uz1) = N
