Abstract
The purpose of this article is to study directed collapsibility of directed Euclidean cubical complexes. One application of this is in the nontrivial task of verifying the execution of concurrent programs. The classical definition of collapsibility involves certain conditions on a pair of cubes of the complex. The direction of the space can be taken into account by requiring that the past links of vertices remain homotopy equivalent after collapsing. We call this type of collapse a link-preserving directed collapse. In this paper, we give combinatorially equivalent conditions for preserving the topology of the links, allowing for the implementation of an algorithm for collapsing a directed Euclidean cubical complex. Furthermore, we give conditions for when link-preserving directed collapses preserve the contractability and connectedness of directed path spaces, as well as examples when link-preserving directed collapses do not preserve the number of connected components of the path space between the minimum and a given vertex.
1 Introduction
Edsger W. Dijkstra proposed the P V -model [4] as a way to study properties of concurrent programs. One way to interpret this model when the program does not contain loops is to consider the states of such a P V program as a subset of Rn that consist of unions of unit cubes called a Euclidean cubical complex. Each axis represents a sequence of actions a process completes in the program execution. A directed path (nondecreasing in all coordinates) represents a (partial) program execution.

Such executions are equivalent if the corresponding directed paths are directed homotopic, i.e., if the space of such paths is connected. We give a well-known example of a Euclidean cubical complex with directed paths in Figure 1. This example is commonly known as the Swiss Flag. Using Euclidean cubical complexes as topological models for concurrent programming has proven to be beneficial. One example is that verifying properties of one execution in each connected component of the space of such paths in a Euclidean cubical complex verifies those properties for the entire concurrent program. A more in depth introduction to this view of concurrency, corresponding geometry, and benefits can be found in [5,6].

Figure 1: The Swiss Flag and Three Directed Paths. The gray squares are the two-cubes of a Euclidean cubical complex. The bimonotone increasing paths are directed paths starting at (0, 0) and ending at (5, 5). The solid directed paths are directed homotopic while the dashed directed path is not directed homotopic to either of the other directed paths since there is a hole in the middle of the complex. Each point highlighted in blue is unreachable, meaning that we cannot reach any point highlighted in blue without breaking bi-monotonicity in a path starting at (0, 0).
A non-trivial Euclidean cubical complex contains uncountably many directed paths and more information than we need for understanding the topology of the spaces of directed paths. The main question we ask is, How can we simplify a directed Euclidean cubical complexes while still preserving spaces of directed paths? In the realm of concurrent computing, answering this question can help simplify concurrent programs and speed up the program verification process.
Past links are local representations of a Euclidean cubical complex at vertices. They were introduced in [18] as a means to show that any finite homotopy type can be realized as a connected component of the space of execution paths for some P V -model. In [1], we found conditions for when the local information of past links preserve the global information on the homotopy type of spaces of directed paths. Because of these relationships between past links and directed path spaces, we define collapsing in terms of past links. We call this type of collapsing link-preserving directed collapse (LPDC). We aim to compress a Euclidean cubical complex by LPDCs before attempting to answer questions about directed path

spaces. The main result of this paper is Theorem 4 and is a very simple crite-
rion for such a collapsing to be allowed: A pair of cubes, (,  ), is an LPDC pair if and only if it is a collapsing pair in the non-directed sense and  does not contain the minimum vertex of . This condition greatly simplifies the definition of LPDC and is easy to add to a collapsing algorithm for Euclidean cubical complexes in the undirected setting. Algorithms and implementations in this setting already exist such as in [13]. Furthermore, we provide conditions for when LPDCs preserve the contractability and connectedness of directed path spaces (Section 4) along with a discussion of some of the limitations (Section 5). This work provides a start at the mathematical foundations for developing polynomial time algorithms that collapse Euclidean cubical complexes and preserve directed path spaces.

2 Background
This paper builds on our prior work [1], as well as work by others [6,8,9,14, 18]. In this section, we recall the definitions of directed Euclidean cubical complexes, which are the objects that we study in this paper. Then, we discuss the relationship between spaces of directed paths and past links in directed Euclidean cubical complexes. For additional background on directed topology (including generalizations of the definitions below), we refer the reader to [5]. We also assume the reader is familiar with the notion of homotopy equivalence of topological spaces (denoted using in this paper) and homotopy between paths as presented in [10].

2.1 Directed Spaces and Euclidean Cubical Complexes

Let n be a positive integer. A (closed) elementary cube in Rn is a product of closed intervals of the following form:

[v1 - j1, v1] × [v2 - j2, v2] × . . . × [vn - jn, vn]

n
R

,

(1)

where v = (v1, v2, . . . , vn)  Zn and j = (j1, j2, . . . , jn)  {0, 1}n. We

often refer to elementary cubes simply as cubes. The dimension of the cube

is the number of unit entries in the vector j; specifically, the dimension of

the cube in Eq. (1) is the sum:

n i=1

ji

.

In

particular,

when

j

=

(0, . . . , 0),

the elementary cube is a single point and often denoted using just v. If 

and  are elementary cubes such that   , we say that  is a face of 

and that  is a coface of  . Cubical sets were first introduced in the 1950s

by Serre [15] in a more general setting; see also [2, 7, 11]. Elementary cubes stratify Rn, where two points x, y  Rn are in the

same stratum if and only if they are members of the same set of elementary cubes; we call this the cubical stratification of Rn. Each stratum in the

stratification is either an open cube or a single point. A Euclidean cubical complex (K, K) is a subspace K Rn that is equal to the union of a

set of elementary cubes, together with the stratification K induced by the cubical stratification of Rn; see Fig. 2. We topologize K using the

Figure 2: Euclidean cubical complex in R2 with 24 zero-cubes (vertices), 28 one-cubes (edges), and six two-cubes (squares). By construction, all elementary cubes in a directed Euclidean cubical complex are axis aligned. Consider the vertex v = (3, 4). The edge e = [(2, 4), (3, 4)] (written e = [2, 3] × [4, 4] in the notation of Eq. (1)) is one of the two lower cofaces of v. Since e is not a face of any two-cube, e is a maximal cube. The points 0, w, and x are the minimal vertices of this directed Euclidean cubical complex.
subspace topology with the standard topology on Rn. Note that if   K, then, since K is a union of elementary cubes, all of its faces are necessarily in K as well. If   K with no proper cofaces, then we say that  is a maximal cube in K. We denote the set of closed cubes in (K, K) by K; the set of closed cubes in K is in one-to-one correspondence with the open cubes in K. Specifically, vertices in K correspond to vertices in K and all other elementary cubes in K correspond to their interiors in K. Throughout this paper, we denote the set of zero-cubes in K by verts(K) and note that verts(K) Zn, since all cubes in (K, K) are elementary cubes.
The product order on Rn, denoted , is the partial order such that for two points p = (p1, p2, . . . , pn) and q = (q1, q2, . . . , qn) in Rn, we have p q if and only if pi  qi for each coordinate i. Using this partial order, we define the interval of points in Rn between p and q as
[p, q] := {x | p x q}.
The point p is the minimum vertex of the interval and q is the maximum vertex of the interval, with respect to . Notationally, we write this as min([p, q]) := p and max([p, q]) := q. When q  Zn and p = q + j, for some j  {0, 1}n, the interval is an elementary cube as defined in Eq. (1). If, in addition, j is not the zero vector, then we say that [v - j, v] is a lower coface of v.
Using the fact that the partial order (Rn, ) induces a partial order on the points in K, we define directed paths in K as the set of nondecreasing paths in K: A path in K is a continuous map from the unit interval I = [0, 1] to K. We say that a path  : I  K goes from (0) to (1). Letting KI denote the set of all paths in K, the set of directed

- We call P (K) the set of directed paths (dipaths), and we topologize it

with the compact-open topology. For p, q  K, we denote the subspace

of paths from p to q by -P qp(K). Euclidean cubical complex.1 The

exactly the equivalence classes of directed paths, up to dihomotopy. If two

dipaths, f and g are homotopic through a continuous family of dipaths,

then f and g are called dihomotopic.

Given a directed Euclidean cubical complex, certain subcomplexes will

be of interest:

Definition 1 (Special Complexes). Let (K, K) be a directed Euclidean cubical complex in Rn. Let p  K and let  be an elementary cube (that
need not be in K).

1. The complex above p is Kp := {q  K | p q}.
2. The complex below p is K p := {q  K | q p}. 3. The reachable complex from p is reach(K, p) := {q  K | -P qp(K) =
}.

4. The complex restricted to  is

K| := {  K | min  min  max  max }.

5. If K = In, then we call (K, K) the standard unit cubical complex and often denote it by (In, I). If K = In + x for some x  Zn, then
K is a full-dimensional unit cubical complex.

2.2 Past Links of Directed Cubical Compelxes

An abstract simplicial complex is a finite collection S of sets that is closed

under the subset relation, i.e., if A  S and B is a set such that  = B  A,

then B  S. The sets in S are called simplices. If the simplex A has k + 1

elements, then we say that the dimension of A is dim(A) := k, and we say

A is a k-simplex. For example, the zero-simplices are the singleton sets

and are often referred to as vertices. Since every element of a set A  S

gives rise to a singleton set in the finite set S, A must be finite.

In the cubical stratification of Rn, the link of a point v  Rn is the

intersection of an arbitrarily small sphere around v with the space Rn; that

1Directed Eulcidean cubical complexes are an example of a more general concept known as directed space (d-spaces). To define a d-space, we have a topological space X and we define a set of dipaths P (X)  XI that contains all constant paths, and is closed under taking
- non-decreasing reparameterizations, concatenations, and subpaths. Indeed, P (K) satisfies these properties.

Figure 3: Past link in the Open Top Box. (a) The maximum vertex of this complex is v. The past link lk-K (v) is the simplicial complex comprising three vertices and two edges (shown in
blue/cyan). These simplices are in one-to-one correspondence with
the set of lower cofaces of v (highlighted in pink). For example, the edges of lk-K (v), which are labeled e1 and e2, are in one-toone correspondence with the elementary two-cubes that are lower
cofaces of v. These lower cofaces are 1 = [(v1, v2 - 1, v3 - 1), v] and 2 = [(v1 -1, v2, v3 -1), v], respectively. In the vector notation for simplices of lk-K (v), we write e1 = (1, 0, 1) and e2 = (0, 1, 1). (b) The past link of a vertex x that is neither a minimal nor a

set of lower cofaces of v instead of all cofaces. Thus, we can represent

each simplex in the past link as a vector in {0, 1}n \ {0}n, where the

vector j  {0, 1}n \ {0}n represents the cube [v - j, v] in the simplex-cube

correspondence.2

As a simplicial complex,

has n

vertices {xi}1in, and j represents the simplex {xi|1  i  n, ji = 1}. We are now ready to define the past link of a vertex in a Euclidean cubical

complex:

Definition 2 (Past Link). Let (K, K) be a directed Euclidean cubical complex in Rn. Let v  Zn. The past link of v is the following simplicial
complex:

lk-K (v) := {j  {0, 1}n \ {0}n | [v - j, v]  K}.

As a set, the past link represents all elementary cubes in K for which v is the maximum vertex. As a simplicial complex, it describes (locally) the different types of dipaths to or through v in K; see Fig. 3.
We conclude this section with a lemma summarizing properties of the past link, most of which follow directly from definitions:
Lemma 1 (Properties of Past Links). Let (K, K) be a directed Euclidean cubical complex in Rn. Then, the following statements hold for all v  Zn:
2The point {0}n = (0, . . . , 0)  {0, 1}n is the zero vector, and will never be in the past link. We differentiate this from 0  Rn, which denotes the origin of Rn.

(v).

4. If (K, K) is a full-dimensional unit cubical complex and v = max(verts(K)), then lk-K (v) is the complete simplicial complex on n vertices.

Proof. Statement 1: If K = , then all past links are empty and the

equality trivially holds. If K = , then verts(K) is a finite non empty set.

Thus, there exists q  Rn such that, for all w  verts(K), q w. Let j  lk-K (v). Then, [v - j, v]  K and so v - j  verts(K). Hence, q v - j, which means that j  lk-Kq (v)  pRn lk-Kp (v). The reverse inclusion
follows from the fact that each of these statements holds if and only if.

Statement 2: Observe that if j  lk-K (v), then, by definition of the past link, [v - j, v]  K . Since K  K, we have [v - j, v]  K  K.

Therefore, we can conclude that j  lk-K (v). Statement 3: By Statement 2 (which we just proved), we have the

following

To prove the inclusion in the

other direction, let j  lk-K (v). Since v - j j, then [v - j, v]  K v.

Statement 4: Let v = max(verts(K)). Then, since K is full-dimensional,

for all j  {0, 1}n, [v - j, v]  K. Thus, by definition of past link, we have

that the past link of v is: lk-K (v) := {0, 1}n \ {0}n, which is the complete simplicial complex on n vertices.

2.3 Relationship Between Past Links and Path Spaces

The topology of the past links is intrinsically related to the one of the spaces of directed paths. Specifically, in [1] we prove that the contractability and/or connectedness of past links of vertices in directed Euclidean cubical complexes with a minimum vertex3 implies that all spaces of directed paths with w as initial point are also contractible and/or connected.

Then, for

Furthermore, we proved a partial converse to Theorem 2. Specifically, the converse holds only if K is a reachable directed Euclidean cubical complex as defined in Statement 3 of Definition 1. This is expected: Properties of a part of the directed Euclidean complex which are not reachable from w, will not influence the path spaces from w.

3 Directed Collapsing Pairs
Although simplicial collapses preserve the homotopy type of the underlying space [12, Proposition 6.14] and hence of all path spaces, this type of collapsing in directed Euclidean cubical complexes may not preserve topological properties of spaces of directed paths. In this section, we study a specific type of collapsing called a link-preserving directed collapse. We define link-preserving directed collapses in Section 3.1 and give properties of link-preserving directed collapses in Section 3.2.

3.1 Link-Preserving Directed Collapses
Since we are interested in preserving the directed path spaces through collapses, the results from Section 2.3 motivate us to study a type of directed collapse (DC) via past links, introduced in [1]. However, we will call it link-preserving directed collapse (LPDC) (as opposed to directed collapse) since we show in the last sections of this paper that when the spaces of directed paths starting from the minimum vertex are not connected, the following definition of collapse does not preserve the number of components.
Definition 3 (Link Preserving Directed Collapse). Let (K, K) be a directed Euclidean cubical complex in Rn. Let   K be a maximal cube, and let  be a proper face of  such that no other maximal cube contains  (in this case, we say that  is a free face of ). Then, we define the (, )-collapse of K as the subcomplex obtained by removing everything in between  and :

K = K \ {  K |     },

(2)

and let K denote the stratification of the set K induced by the cubical stratification of Rn (thus, K K).
We call the directed Euclidean cubical complex (K , K ) a link-preserving directed collapse (LPDC) of (K, K) if, for all v  verts(K ), the past link lk-K (v) is homotopy equivalent to lk-K (v) (denoted lk-K (v) lk-K (v)). The pair (, ) is then called an LPDC pair.
Remark 1 (Simplicial Collapses). The study of simplicial collapses is known as simple homotopy theory [3, 17], and traces back to the work of Whitehead in the 1930s [16]. The idea is very similar: If C is an abstract

8

simplicial complex and   C such that  is a proper face of exactly one maximal simplex , then the following complex is the -collapse of C in the simplicial setting:
C = C \ {  C |     }.
Note that we use only the free face () when defining a simplicial collapse, as doing so helps to distinguish between discussing a simplicial collapse and a directed Euclidean cubical collapse. In addition, we always explicitly state "in the simplicial setting" when talking about a simplicial collapse.
Applying a sequence of LPDCs to a directed Euclidean cubical complex can reduce the number of cubes, and hence can more clearly illustrate the number of dihomotopy classes of directed paths within the directed Euclidean cubical complex. For an example, see Fig. 4. However, it is not necessarily true that LPDCs preserve directed path spaces. We discuss the relationship between directed path spaces and LPDCs in Section 4.
3.2 Properties of LPDCs
We give a combinatorial condition for a collapsing pair (, ) to be an LPDC pair; namely, the condition is that  does not contain the vertex min(). From the definition of an LPDC, we see that finding an LPDC pair requires computing the past link of all vertices in verts(K ). In [1], we discussed how we can reduce the check down to only the vertices in  since no other vertices have their past links affected. In this paper, we prove we need to only check one condition to determine if we have an LPDC pair. The one simple condition dramatically reduces the number of computations we need to perform in order to verify we have an LPDC. This result given in Theorem 4 depends on the following lemmas about the properties of past links on vertices.
Lemma 2 (Properties of Past Links in a Vertex Collapse). Let (K, K) be a directed Euclidean cubical complex in Rn. Let   K and , v  verts() such that  v. If  is a free face of  and K is the (, )-collapse, then the following two statements hold:
1. lk-K| (v) = {j  {0, 1}n \ {0}n | min() v - j}. 2. lk-K | (v) = lk-K| (v) \ {j  {0, 1}n \ {0}n | v - j  }.
Proof. To ease notation, we define the following two sets:
J := {j  {0, 1}n \ {0}n | min() v - j} I := {j  {0, 1}n \ {0}n | v - j  }.
First, we prove Statement 1 (that lk-K| (v) = J). We start with the forward inclusion. Let j  lk-K| (v). By the definition of past links (see Definition 2), we know that [v - j, v]  K|. By the definition of K| (see Definition 1), min() min([v - j, v]) = v - j. This implies j  J. Therefore, lk-K| (v)  J. For the backward inclusion, let j  J. Then, since v  verts() and  is an elementary cube by assumption, and min() v - j by definition of J, we have v - j  verts(). Since   K,

(f ) After Collapses

Figure 4: Collapsing the Swiss Flag. A sequence of vertex collapses is presented from the top left to bottom right. At each stage, the faces and vertices shaded in blue and purple represent the vertex collapsing pairs with the blue Euclidean cube being  and the purple vertex being  . The result of the sequence of LPDCs is shown in (f) is a one-dimensional directed Euclidean cubical complex and one two-cube. Observe that this directed Euclidean cubical complex clearly illustrates the two dihomotopy classes of -P (05,5)(K).

all faces must be in K; hence, [v - j, v]  K|. Therefore, j  lk-K| (v), and so lk-K| (v)  J. Since we have both inclusions, then Statement 1 holds.
Now, we prove Statement 2 (that lk-K | (v) = J \ I). Again, we prove the inclusions in both directions. For the forward inclusion, let j  lk-K | (v). By Statement 2 of Lemma 1, we have lk-K | (v)  lk-K| (v), and so j  lk-K| (v) = J. Next, we must show that j / I. Assume, for a contradiction, that j  I. Then, by definition of I, v - j  .
Since  v, we obtain the partial order v - j  v. This implies that
[, v]  [v - j, v]. Since [v - j, v] is an elementary cube in K |, then its
face [, v] must also be an elementary cube in K |. Setting  = [, v] and
observing  =     , we observe that  is not an elementary cube
in K by Eq. (2). This gives us a contradiction and so j / I. Therefore,

10

lk-K | (v)  J \ I. Finally, we prove the backward inclusion of Statement 2. Let j  J \ I.
Then, by Statement 1, j  lk-K| (v) and either   v - j or  is not comparable to v - j under . Thus, by Eq. (2), [v - j, v] is an elementary cube of K |. Thus, by Definition 2, we have that j  lk-K | (v). Hence, J \ I  lk-K | (v), and so Statement 2 holds.

Using Lemma 2, we see why  cannot be the vertex min() when performing an LPDC. If  = min(), then

lk-K | (v) = {j  {0, 1}n \ {0}n | min() v - j} \ {j  {0, 1}n \ {0}n | v - j min()}
= {j  {0, 1}n \ {0}n | min() v - j and v - j = {j  {0, 1}n \ {0}n | min()  v - j} = {j  {0, 1}n \ {0}n | j  v - min()}

min()}

If v is the maximum vertex of , then we obtain lk-K | (v) = {0, 1}n \ {{0}n, v - min()}. This computation gives us the following corollary, which we illustrate in Fig. 5 when K is a single closed three-cube.
Corollary 1 (Caution for a (min(), )-Collapse). Let (K, K) be a directed Euclidean cubical complex in Rn. Let   K,  = min(), and v  verts(). If  is a free face and K is the (, )-collapse. Then, the past link of v in K | is:
{j  {0, 1}n \ {0}n | j  v - min()}

In particular, if v = max() and k = dim(), then the past link is the complete complex on k elements before the collapse, and, after the collapse, it is homeomorphic to Sk-2. Thus, (, ) is not an LPDC pair.
The following lemma shows under which condition a directed Euclidean cubical collapse induces a simplicial collapse in the past link.
Lemma 3 (Vertex Collapse Induces Simplicial Collapse). Let (K, K) be a directed Euclidean cubical complex in Rn. Let   K and , v  verts() such that  v and  = min(). If  is a free face of  and K is the (, )-collapse, then lk-K (v) is the (v -  )-collapse of lk-K (v) in the simplicial setting.

Proof. Consider K v. Since , v  verts() and  is maximal in K, we

know [min(), v] and [, v] are elementary cubes in K v. Since  is a free

face of , we further know that [min(), v] is the only maximal proper

coface of [, v] in K v. By definition of past link (Definition 2), we then

have that v - min() and v - 

are simplices in lk-K

(v), and v - min()

(b) After Collapse

Figure 5: Removing the minimum vertex of a cube. Consider
the directed Euclidean cubical complex in (a), which as a subset of R3 is a single closed three-cube; call this three-cube . Letting  = min(), we observe that the past link of v = max() is contractible before the (, )-collapse and is homeomorphic to S1 after the collapse. Thus, the past links before and after the collapse are
not homotopy equivalent, and so this collapse is not an LPDC.

Next, we prove two lemmas concerning relationships of the past link of a vertex in the original directed Euclidean cubical complex and in the collapsed directed Euclidean cubical complex. These relationships depend on where v is located with respect to  . In the first lemma, we consider the case where min( ) v, and we present a sufficient condition for past links in K and the (, )-collapse to be equal. See Fig. 6 for an example that illustrates the result of this lemma.

Lemma 4 (Condition for Past Links in K and K to be Equal). Let

(K, K) be a directed Euclidean cubical complex in Rn. Let ,   K such

that  is a face of . If  is a free face of  and K is the (, )-collapse,

then, for all v  verts(K) such that max( ) lk-K (v).

Proof. By Statement 2 of Lemma 1, we have lk-K (v)  lk-K (v). Thus, we only need to show lk-K (v)  lk-K (v). Suppose j  lk-K (v). By the definition of the past link (see Definition 2), we know that [v - j, v] is an
elementary cube in K. By assumption, max( ) v. Thus, by Eq. (2),
[v - j, v] is not removed from K and thus is an elementary cube in K . Thus, j  lk-K (v).

In the following lemma, we consider the case where max( ) v, and we present a sufficient condition for past links in the (, )-collapse and the (min( ), )-collapse to be equal. See Fig. 7 for an example that illustrates this result.

Figure 6: Past link of an "uncomparable" vertex before and after a collapse. Consider the directed Euclidean cubical complex shown, comprising a single three-cube  and all of its faces. Let  = [x, y]. Since v and max( ) = y are not comparable, by Lemma 4, the past link of v is the same before and after the collapse. Indeed, we see that this is the case for this example. The past link of v is the complete complex on two vertices both before and after the collapse.

max( )

v,

then

v

and

lk-K

(v)

=

lk- (v). K

Proof. We first show v  verts(K). If  is a zero-cube (and hence

in verts(K)), then K = K, which means that v  verts(K). On the

other hand, if  is not a zero-cube, then we have min( )  max( ) v.

In particular, min( ) = v. Thus, min( )  v. And so, by definition of K

as a (min( ), )-collapse and since v  K, we conclude that v  K.

Next,

we

show

lk-K

=

lk- (v). K

By Statement 2 of Lemma 1, we

have

lk- (v) K



lk-K

Thus, what remains to be proven is lk-K (v) 

lk- (v). K

Let j  lk-K (v).

By definition of the past link (Definition 2),

we know that [v - j, v]  K . Consider two cases: v - j min( ) and

v - j min( ).

Case 1 (v - j min( )): Since v - j min( ) max( ) v, we

know that   [v - j, v]. Thus, by Eq. (2), we have [v - j, v] K , which

is a contradiction. So, Case 1 cannot happen.

Case 2 (v - j min( )): If v - j min( ), then, by the definition

of a (min( ), )-collapse in Definition 3, we know [v - j, v]  K and

thus j  lk- (v).

Hence,

lk-K

(v)



lk- (v). K

Since we have both subset inclusions, we

conclude

lk-K

(v)

=

lk- (v). K

The next result states that vertex collapses result in homotopy equivalent past links as long as we are not collapsing the minimum vertex of the directed Euclidean cubical complex.

Figure 7: Two collapses with same past links. For example, in the directed Euclidean cubical complex K shown in (a), let  be the three-cube, and let  = [x, y]. We look at the past link of the vertex v. In the original directed Euclidean cubical complex, the past link of v is the complete complex on three vertices. By Lemma 5, the past link of v is the same in both the (, )-collapse and the (x, )-collapse since max( ) = y v. By Lemma 6, we also know that the past links of v in K and the (x, )-collapse are homotopy equivalent. Indeed, we see that this is the case.

Lemma 6 (Past Links in a Vertex Collapse). Let (K, K) be a directed Euclidean cubical complex in Rn. Let   K and let   verts() such that  = min(). Let v  verts(K) with v =  If  is a free face of  and K is the (, )-collapse, then lk-K (v) lk-K (v).
Proof. We consider three cases:
Case 1 (v / verts()): By definition of past link (Definition 2), if v / verts(), then the past links lk-K (v) and lk-K (v) are equal.
Case 2 ( v): By Lemma 4, if  = max( ) v, again we have equality of the past links lk-K (v) and lk-K (v).
Case 3 (v  verts() and  v): By Lemma 3, we know that lk-K (v) is the  -collapse of lk-K (v) in the simplicial setting. Since simplicial collapses preserve the homotopy type (see e.g., [12, Proposition 6.14]), we conclude lk-K (v) lk-K (v).

We give an example of Lemma 6 in Fig. 7 by showing how the LPDC induces a simplicial collapse on past links.
Lastly, we are ready to prove the main result.

Theorem 4 (Main Theorem). Let (K, K) be a directed Euclidean cubical

complex

in

n
R

such

that

there

exist

cubes

, 



K

with



a

free

face

of

. Then, (, ) is an LPDC pair if and only if min() / verts( ).

Proof. Let (K , K ) be the (, )-collapse. Let (L, L) be the cubical complex such that L = K|. Since   K, we know L =  (i.e., L is a unit cube). Since L is a single unit cube and  is the maximal elementary

14

cube, all proper faces of , including  and min( ), are free faces. Thus,

let (L , L ) be the (, )-collapse of L, and let (L, L) be the (min( ), )-

collapse of L.

We first prove the forward direction by contrapositive (if min() /

verts( ), then (, ) is not an LPDC pair. Assume min()  verts( ).

Since  is a face of , we know max( ) max(). Since min() 

verts( ) and since dim() = dim( ) + 1, we know that max() = max( ).

Thus,  = min() and so min()  verts(L ). Applying Lemma 5 us-

ing

v

max(),

we

obtain

lk-L (v)

=

lk-(v). L

Let d = dim().

By

Corollary

1,

we

obtain

lk-L (v)

is

to

and

lk-(v) L

is

homeomorphic to Sd-2. Thus,

lk-L (v)

S

lk-(v) L

(v),

and so lk-L (v) lk-L (v). Since K \ L and K \ L are sets of faces of , the past link of v remains the same outside of L in both K and K .Thus, lk-K (v) lk-K (v) and so we conclude that (, ) is not an LPDC pair, as was to be shown.

Next, we show the backwards direction. Suppose min()  verts( ).

Let v  verts(K ), and consider two cases: max( ) v and max( ) v.

Case 1 (max( ) v): By Lemma 4, we have lk-K (v) = lk-K (v). Hence, lk-K (v) lk-K (v). Since v was arbitrarily chosen, we conclude that (, ) is an LPDC pair.

Case 2 (max( )

v):

By Lemma

5,

we

have

that

lk-L

(v)

=

lk-(v). L

Since min()  verts( ), we know that min( ) = min(). Applying

Lemma 6, we obtain lk-L (v)

lk-(v). Again, since K \ L and K \ L L

are sets of faces of , the past link of v remains the same outside of L in

both K and K .Thus, lk-K (v) lk-K (v). Since v was arbitrarily chosen,

we conclude that (, ) is an LPDC pair.

4 Preservation of Spaces of Directed Paths
We focus on LPDCs because of the relationships between past links and spaces of directed paths that were proved in [1]. We explain how those relationships extend to the LPDC setting in this section.
One result from [1](Theorem 1) states that for a directed Euclidean cubical complex with a minimum vertex, if all past links are contractible, then all spaces of directed paths starting at that minimum vertex are also contractible. If we start with a directed Euclidean cubical complex with a minimum vertex that has all contractible past links, then all spaces of directed paths from the minimum vertex are contractible by this theorem. Applying an LPDC will preserve the homotopy type of past links by definition. Hence, applying the theorem again, we see that any LPDC will also have contractible directed path spaces from the minimum vertex. Notice that the minimum vertex is not removed in an LDPC, since it is a vertex and minimal in all cubes containing it (including the maximal cube). We give an example of this in Example 1.
Example 1 (3 × 3 filled grid). Let K be the 3 × 3 filled grid. For all v  verts(K), lk-K (v) is contractible. By Theorem 1, this implies that all

15

spaces of directed paths starting at 0 are contractible. Applying an LPDC such as the edge [(1, 3), (2, 3)] results in contractible past links in K and so all spaces of directed paths in K are also contractible. See Fig. 8. We can generalize this example to any kd filled grid where k, d  N.

Figure 8: (a) The 3 × 3 filled grid has contractible past links and directed path spaces. The pair comprising of the purple edge [(1, 3), (2, 3)] and the blue square [(1, 2), (2, 3)] is an LPDC pair. (b) The result of performing the LPDC. All past links are contractible and so all directed path spaces are also contractible.

An analogous result holds for connectedness (Theorem 2). If we start

with a directed Euclidean cubical complex that has all connected past links, then all directed path spaces are connected. Any LPDC will result

in a directed Euclidean cubical complex that also has connected directed

path spaces. See Example 2.

Example 2 (Outer Cubes of the 5 × 5 × 5 Grid). Let K = [0, 5]3 \ [1, 4]3,

which, as an undirected complex, is homeomorphic to a thickened two-

sphere. implies

For that

all v  verts(K), lk-K (v) for all v  verts(K), the

is connected. By space of directed

Theorem 2, this paths -P v0(K) is

connected. Applying an LPDC such as with the vertex (5, 0, 0) in the cube

[(4, 0, 0), (5, 1, 1)] results in connected past links in K and so all spaces of directed paths -P v0(K ) are connected. We can generalize this example to any kd grid where d  3 and the inner cubes of dimension d are removed.

Both Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 have assumptions on the topology of past links and results on the topology of spaces of directed paths from the minimum vertex. We may ask if the converse statements are true. Does knowing the topology of spaces of directed paths from the minimum vertex tell us anything about the topology of past links? The converse to Theorem 1 holds. To prove this, we first need a lemma whose proof appears in [18].

Lemma 7 (Homotopy Equivalence [18, Prop. 5.3]). Let (K, K) be a di-

rected Euclidean cubical complex in Rn. Let p, q  Zn. contractible for all j  lk-K (q), then -P qp(K) lk-Kp (q).

If -P pq-j(K) is

Thus, we obtain:

16

Theorem 5 (Contractability). Let (K, K) be a directed Euclidean cubical complex in Rn that has a minimum vertex w. The following two statements are equivalent:
1. For all v  verts(K), the space of directed paths -P vw(K) is contractible.
2. For all v  verts(K), the past link lk-K (v) is contractible.

Proof. By Theorem 1, we obtain Statement 2 implies Statement 1.
Next, we show that Statement 1 implies Statement 2. Let v  verts(K). FvcAoeogrnrattsiran(alK,lcstj)ii.nbcleTe.lkhvB-Kuys(,vvL)bee,yrmttsham(seKsauc)7um,,btpwehteei[ovpknan,-toahwjl,lsvptdh]aiacrteec--PtPKevwdvw, ((wpKKha)t)ichihsslmcpkoa-Kencaw tenrsas(c-Ptvthi)vwba-l=tej.(vlKkT--Kh)(ejavrre)e-. fore, lk-K (v) is contractible.

As a consequence of this theorem, we know that if we start with a directed Euclidean cubical complex with contractible directed path spaces starting at the minimum vertex, then any LPDC will also result in a directed Euclidean cubical complex with all contractible directed path spaces starting at the minimum vertex, and vice versa.

Corollary 2 (Preserving Directed Path Space Contractability). Let (K, K) be a directed Euclidean cubical complex in Rn that has a minimum ver-

tex w. Let ,   K such that  is a face of . If  is a free face of

, let (K , K ) be the (, )-collapse. If K is an LPDC of K, then the

spaces of and only

directed paths if the spaces of

-Pdivwre(cKte)dapreatchosn-tPrakwc(tKible)

for are

all v  verts(K) if contractible for all

k  verts(K ).

Proof. We start with the forwards direction by assuming that the spaces of directed paths -P vw(K) are contractible for all v  verts(K). Theorem 5 tells us that all past links lk-K (v) are contractible for all v  verts(K). This implies that lk-K (k) is contractible for all k  verts(K ) because K
is an LPDC of K. Applying Theorem 5 again, we see that all spaces of directed paths -P kw(K ) are contractible for all k  verts(K ).

Next we prove the backwards direction by assuming that the spaces of directed paths -P kw(K ) are contractible for all k  verts(K ). Let

v  verts(K). Either v  verts(K ) or v / verts(K ).

Case 1 (v  verts(K )): By Theorem 5, we know that lk-K (v) is contractible. Since K is an LPDC of K, then lk-K (v) is also contractible.

Case 2 (v / verts(K )): If v / verts(K), then  is a vertex and v =  .

Observe that lk-( ) is contractible since  is an elementary cube and

 does not contain min(). Furthermore, notice that lk-K ( ) = lk- ( )

because  is a free face of . Hence, lk-K ( ) is contractible.

Therefore rem 5, we get

contractible for all (K) is contractible

v  verts(K). Applying for all v  verts(K).

Theo-

Using Theorem 2, the partial converse to the connectedness theorem [1, Theorem 3], we get that any LPDC of a directed Euclidean cubical

17

complex with connected directed path spaces and reachable vertices will result in a directed Euclidean cubical complex with connected directed path spaces.

Corollary 3 (Condition for LPDCs to Preserve Connectedness of All Di-

rected Path Spaces). Let (K, K) be a directed Euclidean cubical complex in Rn that has a minimum vertex w. Let (L, L) = reach(K, w). Let (, )

be an LPDC pair in L, and let L be the (, )-collapse. The spaces of

We note that reachability is a necessary condition. Below we give an example of a directed Euclidean cubical complex K that has all connected directed path spaces but an LPDC yields a directed Euclidean cubical complex with a disconnected path space.

(b) After Collapse

Figure 9: The bowling ball before and after the collapse described in Example 3. Observe -P 0(5,5,5)(K) has one connected component. Additionally,  = [(4, 1, 1), (5, 2, 2)] (highlighted in purple) and  =
[(5, 1, 1), (5, 2, 2)] (highlighted in blue) is an LPDC pair. After collapsing (, ), -P (05,5,5)(K) changes from having one connected component to three connected components. The three connected
components are represented by the three directed paths.

Example 3 (Bowling Ball). Let K be the boundary of the 5 × 5 × 5 grid union [(4, 1, 1), (5, 2, 2)] and [(4, 3, 3), (5, 4, 4)] \ [(5, 3, 3), (5, 4, 4)]. See Fig. 9(a). Notice that some vertices of K are unreachable. Furthermore, all past links of vertices in K are connected and so all directed path spaces starting at 0 are also connected. After performing an LPDC with  = [(5, 1, 1), (5, 2, 2)] and  = [(4, 1, 1), (5, 2, 2)], the directed path space between 0 and (5, 5, 5) changes from having one connected component to three connected components, as shown in the figure. This example shows that the reachability condition in Corollary 3 is necessary for preserving connnectedness in LPDCs.
LPDCs can also preserve dihomotopy classes of directed paths starting at the minimum vertex of many directed Euclidean cubical complexes

18

that have disconnected past links. Recall the Swiss flag as discussed in Fig. 4. The Swiss flag has disconnected past links at (3, 4) and (4, 3), yet there exists a sequence of LPDCs that results in a directed Euclidean cubical complex that highlights the two dihomotopy classes of directed paths between 0 and (5.5). Example 4 gives another similar situation.

Figure 10: Link-preserving DCs of the window. A sequence of LPDCs is presented from (a)-(e). The directed Euclidean cubical complex in (b) comes from performing several vertex LPDCs to remove the two-cubes along the border of K. In (b)-(d), the LPDC pairs (, ) are highlighted in purple and blue respectively. The result of the sequence of LPDCs is a graph of vertices and edges that more clearly illustrates the dihomotopy classes of directed paths in the directed path space.

Example 4 (Window). Let K be the 5 × 5 grid with the following two-

cube interiors removed: [(1, 1), (2, 2)], [(3, 1), (4, 2)], [(1, 3), (2, 4)], [(3, 3), (4, 4)].

See Fig. 10(a). K has disconnected past links at the vertices (2, 2), (4, 2), (2, 4), (4, 4)

so

K

does

not

satisfy

Corollary

or

Corollary

3.

Observe

that

- P

(K

)(05,5)

has six connected components. We can perform a sequence of LPDCs that

preserves the dihomotopy classes of directed paths between 0 and (5, 5) at

each step. First, we apply vertex LPDCs to remove the two-cubes along

the border. Then we can apply four edge LPDCs and one vertex LPDC

to get a graph of vertices and edges. This graph more clearly illustrates

the

six

dihomotopy

classes

of

directed

paths

in

- P

(K

)(05,5)

.

In summary, LPDCs preserve the connectedness and/or contractability

of directed path spaces starting at the minimum vertex as long as K has

all reachable vertices and all directed path spaces starting at the minimum

vertex in K connected and/or contractible to begin with. If K does not

have these properties, the first step could be to remove all unreachable

19

vertices and cubes before collapsing. In the next section, it will become clear that this will not suffice, if the path spaces are not all connected or contractible.

5 Discussion

LPDCs preserve spaces of directed paths in many examples (see Section 4), in particular, if they are all trivial in the sense of either all connected or all contractible and the directed Euclidean cubical complex is reachable for the minimum. However, LPDCs do not always preserve spaces of directed paths. We discuss some of those instances here. One limitation of LPDCs is that the number of components may increase after an LPDC as we saw in Example 3 or, as we will see in Example 5 they may decrease.

Example 5 (Window. LPDC that does not Preserve Directed Path

Spaces). Consider K as given in Example 4. After applying vertex LPDCs

that remove the two-cubes on the border of K, we can apply an LPDC to

the edge whereas,

[(2, the

4), (3, path

s4p)]a.ceN-oPw(K-P)((05K,5))(0h5,a5s)

has five connected components; six connected components. See

Fig. 11. This example shows that there are both "good" and "bad" ways

to apply a sequence of LPDCs to a directed Euclidean cubical complex. As

illustrated in Example 4, there exists a sequence of LPDCs that preserves

the

six

connected

components

in

- P (K

)(05,5) .

However,

if

we

perform

a

se-

quence of LPDCs that removes the edge [(2, 4), (3, 4)] as in this example,

then we get a directed Euclidean cubical complex that does not preserve

the

dihomotopy

classes

of

directed

paths

in

- P (K

)(05,5) .

Example 5 illustrates the need to investigate other properties if we want to preserve directed path spaces when performing an LPDC.

In Example 3 the problem was the existence of unreachable vertices.

In Example 5, the vertex (2, 4) is a deadlock after the LPDC - only trivial

20

dipaths initiate from there - whereas before collapse, that was not the case. This seems to suggest that the introduction of new deadlocks should not be allowed - an extra, but computationally easy check on vertices of .
Moreover, vertex LPDCs appear to not introduce the problems of unreachability and deadlocks. These observations lead us to suspect that studying unreachability, deadlocks, and vertex LPDCs can help us better understand when LPDCs perserve and do not preserve directed path spaces between the minimum and a given vertex. We leave this as future work.
In summary, we provided an easy check for determining when we have an LPDC pair as well as various settings for when LPDCs preserve spaces of directed paths. This work provides a mathematical foundation for algorithms that simplify directed Euclidean cubical complexes that model phenomena with directed paths. Fully understanding when LPDCs preserve spaces of directed paths between a minimum and a given vertex will yield the full algorithm of how to compress a directed Euclidean cubical complex while preserving spaces of directed paths.
