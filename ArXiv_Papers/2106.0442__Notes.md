## Abstract

We study hydrodynamic limits of three kinds of one-dimensional stochastic log-gases known as Dyson's Brownian motion model, its chiral version, and the Bru--Wishart process studied in dynamical random matrix theory. We define the measure-valued processes so that their Cauchy transforms solve the complex Burgers-type equations. We show that applications of the method of characteristic curves to these partial differential equations provide functional equations relating the Cauchy transforms of measures at an arbitrary time and those at the initial time. We rewrite the complex Burgers-like equations and functional equations for the Cauchy transforms of the log-gas measures to those for the $R$-transforms and the $S$-transforms of the measures which play central roles in free probability theory. Some of the results are discussed using the notion of free convolutions.
