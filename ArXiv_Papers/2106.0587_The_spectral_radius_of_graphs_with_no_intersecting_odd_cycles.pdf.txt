Abstract Let Hs,k be the graph defined by intersecting s triangles and k cycles of odd lengths at least five in exactly one common vertex. Recently, Hou, Qiu and Liu [Discrete Math. 341 (2018) 126­137], and Yuan [J. Graph Theory 89 (2018), no. 1, 26­39] determined independently the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex graph that does not contain Hs,k as a subgraph. In this paper, we determine the graphs of order n that attain the maximum spectral radius among all graphs containing no Hs,k for n large enough.
Key words: Spectral radius; Intersecting odd cycles; Extremal graph; Stability mathod.
1 Introduction
In this paper, we consider only simple and undirected graphs. Let G be a simple connected graph with vertex set V (G) = {v1, . . . , vn} and edge set E(G) = {e1, . . . , em}. Let d(v) or dG(v) be the degree of a vertex v in G. Let S be a set of vertices. We write dS(v) for the number of neighbors of v in the set S, that is, dS (v) = |N (v)  S|. And we denote by e(S) the number of edges contained in S.
The Tura´n number of a graph F is the maximum number of edges that may be in an n-vertex graph without a subgraph isomorphic to F , and it is usually denoted by ex(n, F ). We say that a graph G is F -free if it does not contain an isomorphic copy of F as a subgraph. A graph on n vertices with no subgraph F and with ex(n, F ) edges is called an extremal graph for F and we denote by Ex(n, F ) the set of all extremal graphs on n vertices for F . It is a cornerstone of extremal graph theory to understand ex(n, F ) and Ex(n, F ) for various graphs F ; see [23, 27, 39] for surveys.
In 1941, Tura´n [40] posed the natural question of determining ex(n, Kr+1) for r  2. Let Tr(n) denote the complete r-partite graph on n vertices where its part sizes are as equal as possible. Tura´n [40] (also see [5, p. 294]) extended a result of Mantel [29] and obtained that if G is an n-vertex graph containing no Kr+1, then e(G)  e(Tr(n)), equality holds if and only if G = Tr(n). There are many extension and generalization on Tura´n's result. The problem of determining ex(n, F ) is usually called the Tura´n-type extremal problem.

The most celebrated extension always attributes to a result of Erdos, Stone and Simonovits [14, 13], which states that

ex(n, F ) =

1 (H )

+

o(1)

n2 2

,

(1)

where (F ) is the vertex-chromatic number of H. This provides good asymptotic estimates for the extremal numbers of non-bipartite graphs. However, for bipartite graphs, where (F ) = 2, it only gives the bound ex(n, F ) = o(n2). Although there have been numerous attempts on finding better bounds of ex(n, F ) for various bipartite graphs F , we know very little in this case. The history of such a case began in 1954 with the Ko¨vari-So´s-Tura´n theorem [28], which states that if Ks,t is the complete bipartite graph with vertex classes of size s  t, then ex(n, Ks,t) = O(n2-1/t); see [19, 20] for more details. In particular, we refer the interested reader to the comprehensive survey by Fu¨redi and Simonovits [23].

1.1 History and background

In this section, we shall review the exact values of ex(n, F ) for some special graphs F ,
instead of the asymptotic estimation. A graph on 2k + 1 vertices consisting of k triangles
which intersect in exactly one common vertex is called a k-fan (also known as the friendship
graph) and denoted by Fk. Since (Fk) = 3, the Erdos-Stone-Simonovits theorem in (1) implies that ex(n, Fk) = n2/4 + o(n2). In 1995, Erdos et al. [15] proved the following exact result.

Theorem 1.1. [15] For every k  1, and for every n  50k2,

ex(n, Fk) =

n2 4

+

k2 - k, if k is odd,

k2

-

3 2

k,

if k is even.

The extremal graphs of Theorem 1.1 are as follows. For odd k (where n  4k - 1),

the extremal graph is uniquely constructed by taking a complete bipartite graph with color

classes

of

size



n 2



and



n 2



and

embedding

two

For

even k (where now n  4k - 3), the extremal graph in not unique, and each extremal graph

is constructed by taking a balanced complete bipartite graph and embedding a graph with

2k

vertices,

-

3 2

k

with

k

in

side.

Let Ck,q be the graph consisting of k cycles of length q which intersect exactly in one
common vertex. Clearly, when we set q = 3, then Ck,3 is just the k-fan graph; see Theorem
1.1. When q is an odd integer, we can see that (Ck,q) = 3, the Erdos-Stone-Simonovits theorem also implies that ex(n, Ck,q) = n2/4 + o(n2). In 2016, Hou, Qiu and Liu [25]
determined exactly the extremal number for Ck,q with k  1 and odd integer q  5.

Theorem 1.2. [25] For an integer k  1 and an odd integer q  5, there exists n0(k, q) such that for all n  n0(k, q), we have

ex(n, Ck,q) =

n2 4

+ (k - 1)2.

Moreover, an extremal graph must be a Tura´n graph T2(n) with a Kk-1,k-1 embedding into one class.

2

We remark here that when q is even, then Ck,q is a bipartite graph where every vertex in one of its parts has degree at most 2. For such a sparse bipartite graph, a classical result of Fu¨redi [18] or Alon, Krivelevich and Sudakov [2] implies that ex(n, Ck,q) = O(n3/2). Recently, a breakthrough result of Conlon, Lee and Janzer [10, 11] shows that for even q  6 and k  1, we have ex(n, Ck,q) = O(n3/2-) for some  = (k, q) > 0. It is a challenging problem to determine the value (k, q). For instance, the special case k = 1,
this problem reduces to determine the extremal number for even cycle.
Next, we shall introduce a unified extension of both Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2. Let
s, k be integers and let Hs,k be a graph consisting of s triangles and k cycles of odd lengths at least 5 which intersect in exactly one common vertex. The graph Hs,k is also known as the flower graph with s + k petals. We remark here that the k odd cycles can have different
length. Clearly, when k = 0, then Hs,0 = Fs, the s-fan graph; see Theorem 1.1. In addition, when s = 0 and the lengths of odd cycles are all equal to q, then H0,k = Ck,q; see Theorem 1.2.
In 2018, Hou, Qiu and Liu [26] and Yuan [42] independently determined the extremal
number of Hs,k for s  0 and k  1. Let Fn,s,k be the family of graphs with each member being a Tura´n graph T2(n) with a graph H embedded in one partite set, where

H = Ks+k-1,s+k-1, if (s, k) = (3, 1), K3,3 or 3K3, if (s, k) = (3, 1),

where 3K3 is the union of three disjoint triangles.

Theorem 1.3. [26, 42] For two integers s  0, k  1, there exists n0(s, k) such that for all

n  n0(s, k), we have

ex(n, Hs,k) =

n2 4

+ (s + k - 1)2.

Moreover, the only extremal graphs for Hs,k are members of Fn,s,k.

1.2 Spectral extremal problem

Let G be a simple graph on n vertices. The adjacency matrix of G is defined as A(G) = (aij)n×n with aij = 1 if two vertices vi and vj are adjacent in G, and aij = 0 otherwise. We say that G has eigenvalues 1, . . . , n if these values are eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix A(G). Let (G) be the maximum value in absolute among the eigenvalues of G, which is known as the spectral radius of graph G, that is,

(G) = max{|| :  is an eigenvalue of G}.

By the Perron­Frobenius Theorem [24, p. 534], the spectral radius of a graph G is actually

the largest eigenvalue of G since the adjacency matrix A(G) is nonnegative. The spectral

radius of a graph sometimes can give some informations about the structure of graphs. For

example, it is well-known [4, p. 34] that the average degree of G is at most (G), which is

at most the maximum degree of G.

In this paper we consider spectral analogues of Tura´n-type problems for graphs. That

is, determining exsp(n, F ) = max{(G) : |G| = n, F G}. It is well-known that

ex(n,

F)

exsp(n,

F

)

because of the fundamental inequality

2m n

 (G).

For most graphs, this study is again

fairly complete due in large part to a longstanding work of Nikiforov [36]. For example, he

extended the classical theorem of Tura´n, by determining the maximum spectral radius of

any Kr+1-free graph G on n vertices. The following problem regarding the adjacency spectral radius was proposed in [30]:

What is the maximum spectral radius of a graph G on n vertices without a subgraph

isomorphic to a given graph F ? Wilf [41] and Nikiforov [30] obtained spectral strengthening

of Tura´n's theorem when the forbidden substructure is the complete graph. Soon after,

Nikiforov [31] showed that if G is a Kr+1-free graph on n vertices, then (G)  (Tr(n)), with equality if and only if G = Tr(n). Moreover, Nikiforov [31] (when n is odd), and Zhai and Wang [43] (when n is even) determined the maximum spectral radius of K2,2free graphs. Furthermore, Nikiforov [33], Babai and Guiduli [3] independently obtained

the spectral generalization of the Kovari-So´s-Tura´n theorem when the forbidden graph is

the complete bipartite graph Ks,t. Finally, Nikiforov [34] characterized the spectral radius

of graphs without paths and cycles of specified length. In addition, Fiedler and Nikiforov

[16] obtained tight sufficient conditions for graphs to be Hamiltonian or traceable. For

many other spectral analogues of results in extremal graph theory we refer the reader to

the survey [36]. It is worth mentioning that a corresponding spectral extension [35] of the

Erdos-Stone-Simonovits theorem states that

exsp(n, F ) =

1

-

1 (F )

-

1

+

o(1)

n.

From this result, we know that exsp(n, Fk) = n/2 + o(n) where Fk is the k-fan graph. Recently, Cioaba, Feng, Tait and Zhang [7] generalized this bound by improving the error term o(n) to O(1), and obtained a spectral counterpart of Theorem 1.1. More precisely, they proved the following theorem.
Theorem 1.4. [7] Let G be a graph of order n that does not contain a copy of Fk where k  2. For sufficiently large n, if G has the maximal spectral radius, then

G  Ex(n, Fk).
Recall that Hs,k is the graph consisting of s triangles and k cycles of odd lengths at least 5 which intersect in exactly one common vertex. Note that the k odd cycles can have different length. In this paper, we shall prove the following theorem.
Theorem 1.5 (Main result). Let G be a graph of order n that does not contain a copy of Hs,k, where s  0 and k  1. For sufficiently large n, if G has the maximal spectral radius, then
G  Ex(n, Hs,k).
It is interesting that the spectral extremal example sometimes differs from the usual extremal example. For instance, Nikiforov [31], and Zhai and Wang [43] proved that the maximum spectral radius of a C4-free graph on n vertices is uniquely achieved by the friendship graph. This is very different from the usual extremal problem for the maximum number of edges in a C4-free graphs, since Fu¨redi [21] showed that for n large enough with the form n = q2 + q + 1, the extremal number is uniquely attained by the polarity graph of

4

a projective plane. From Theorem 1.4 and Theorem 1.5, we know that graphs attaining the maximum spectral radius among all Fk-free (Hs,k-free) graphs also contain the maximum number of edges among all Fk-free (Hs,k-free) graphs.
Our theorem is a spectral result of the Tura´n extremal problem for Hs,k, it can be viewed as an extension of Theorem 1.4, as well as a spectral analogue of Theorem 1.3. Our treatment strategy of the proof is mainly based on the stability method. To some extent, this paper could be regarded as a continuation and development of [7]. The heart of the proof and all key ideas lie in the proof of stability. We know that if we forbid the substructure Fk, then the neighbor of each vertex does not contain a matching of k edges. While we forbid the intersecting odd-length cycles, the neighbor of each vertex does not contain a long path, which can be viewed as a key observation in our extension. In addition, the embedding method of Hs,k is slightly different from that of Fk, we need to prove the existence of a larger bipartite subgraph. We remark here that the spectral stability method is also used in a recent paper to deal with the extremal problem of odd-wheel graph [8].

2 Some Lemmas

In this section, we state some lemmas which are needed in our proof.

Lemma 2.1. [12] Let Pt denote the path on t vertices. If G is a Pt-free graph on n vertices,

then

e(G)

If

The next is the famous triangle removal lemma [37, 9, 17].

Lemma 2.3. [37] For every  > 0, there exists () > 0 such that every n-vertex graph with at most () · n3 triangles can be made triangle-free by removing at most n2 edges.

Lemma 2.4 (Fu¨redi [22]). Let G be a triangle-free graph on n vertices. If s > 0 and e(G) = e(T2(n))-s, then there exists a bipartite subgraph H  G such that e(H)  e(G)-s.

Let G be a simple graph with matching number (G) and maximum degree (G). For given two integers  and , define f (, ) = max{e(G) : (G)  , (G)  }.
In 1976, Chv´atal and Hanson [6] obtained the following result.

Lemma 2.5 (Chv´atal-Hanson [6]). For every two integers   1 and   1, we have

f (, ) =  +

 2

 /2

  + .

We will frequently use a special case proved by Abbott, Hanson and Sauer [1]:

f (k - 1, k - 1) =

k2 - k, if k is odd,

k2

-

3 2

k,

if k is even.

Furthermore, the extremal graphs attaining the equality case are exactly those we embedded into the Tura´n graph T2(n) to obtain the extremal Fk-free graph.

3 The Proof of Theorem 1.5

In the sequel, we always assume that G is a graph on n vertices containing no Hs,k as a subgraph and attaining the maximum spectral radius. The aim of this section is to prove
that e(G) = ex(n, Hs,k) for n large enough. First of all, we note that G must be connected since adding an edge between different
components will increase the spectral radius and also keep G being Hs,k-free. Let (G) be the spectral radius of G. By the Perron­Frobenius Theorem [24, p. 534], we know that 1 has an eigenvector with all entries being positive, we denoted such an eigenvector by x. For
a vertex v  V (G), we will write xv for the eigenvector entry of x corresponding to v. We may normalize x so that it has maximum entry equal to 1, and let z be a vertex such that
xz = 1. If there are multiple such vertices, we choose and fix z arbitrarily among them. In the sequel, we shall prove Theorem 1.5 iteratively, giving successively better lower
bounds on both e(G) and the eigenvector entries of all of the other vertices, until finally we
can show that e(G) = ex(n, Hs,k). The proof of Theorem 1.5 is outlined as follows.



We

apply

Lemma

2.2

to

give

a

lower

bound

e(G)



n2 4

- O(n);

see

Lemma

3.1.

Then

we use the triangle removal lemma and Fu¨redi's stability result, and show that G has

a

on

S, T

with

n 2

|S|, |T |



n 2

+ o(n).

Moreover,

we

also

have

e(S, T )



n2 4

-

o(n2);

see

Lemma

3.2.

 We show that the number vertices that have (n) neighbors on its side of the partition

is

bounded

by

o(n),

and

the

number

of

vertices

that

have

degree

less

than

(

-

O(1))n

is bounded by O(1); see Lemma 3.3 and 3.4 respectively. Furthermore, we will prove

that such vertices does not exist, and both G[S] and G[T ] are K1,s+k-free and Ms+k-

free; see Lemma 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.

 Based on the previous lemmas, we shall refine the structure of G, and improve the

lower

bound

of

e(G)

to

e(G)



n2 4

- O(1)

and

refine

the

bisection

n 2

- O(1)



|S|, |T |



n 2

+ O(1)

and

also

e(S, T )



n2 4

- O(1);

see

Lemma

3.9.

Moreover,

we

shall

prove

that

xu = 1 - o(1) for every u  V (G); see Lemma 3.10.

 Once we know that all vertices have eigenvector entry close to 1, we can show that the bipartition is balanced; see Lemma 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13. This implies that G can be converted to a graph in Ex(n, Hs,k) by deleting few number of edges within S, T and adding few number edges between S and T . Invoking these facts, we finally show that e(G) = ex(n, Hs,k).

Let H be a Hs,k-free graph on n vertices with maximum number of edges. Since G is the graph maximizing the spectral radius over all Hs,k-free graphs, in view of Theorem 1.3, we can see by the Rayleigh quotient [24, p. 234] or [44, p. 267] that

Proof. Since G is Hs,k-free, the neighborhood of any vertex does not contain P(s+k)c (a path on (s + k)c vertices) as a subgraph. Otherwise, G contains the join graph K1  P(s+k)c, which contains a copy of Hs,k. Thus by Lemma 2.1, we can obtain the following upper
bound for the number of triangles,

Therefore, G has a partition V = S  T which gives a maximum cut such that

(7)

Furthermore, without then |T | = n - |S| > (

we

Hence the assertion (6) holds.

For a vertex v, let dS(v) = |N (v)  S| and dT (v) = |N (v)  T |. Next, we consider the set of vertices that have many neighbors which are not in the cut.
Lemma 3.3. Let ,  be two sufficiently small constants with  < 2/3. We denote

W := {v  S : dS(v)  n}  {v  T : dT (v)  n}

(8)

For sufficiently large n, we have

Proof.

Firstly,

by

Theorem 1.3,

we

On the other hand, if we denote by W1 = W  S and W2 = W  T , then we get

Note that  < 2/3, we can get |W | < n for sufficiently large n.

(11)

Then

|L|  16c2(s + k)2.

Proof. Suppose that |L| > 16c2(s + k)2. Then let L  L with |L| = 16c2(s + k)2. Then it follows that

for sufficiently large n, where the second inequality is by (5). Hence by Theorem 1.3, G - L contains Hs,k, which implies that G contains Hs,k. So the assertion holds.

Now, we have proved that |W | = o(n) and |L| = O(1) by Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4, respectively. Next we will improve the bound on W and actually show that W is a subset of L, so |W | = O(1). To proceed, we first need the following lemma which can be proved by induction or double counting.

Lemma 3.5. Let A1, · · · , Ap be p finite sets. Then
p
|A1  A2  · · ·  Ap|  |Ai| - (p - 1) |pi=1Ai| .
i=1
Lemma 3.6. Let W and L be sets of vertices defined in (8) and (11). Then W  L.

Proof. Suppose on the contrary that there exists a vertex u0  W and u0 / L. Let

L1 = L  S and L2 = L  T . Without loss of generality, we may assume that u0  S, that

is, u0  W1 and u0 / L1. Since S and T form a maximum bipartite subgraph, we have

dT (u0) 

1 2

d(u0).

Indeed, otherwise, we can remove the vertex u into the part T , it will

increase strictly the number of edges between S and T . On the other hand, invoking the

(12)

Claim. u0 is adjacent to at most s + k - 1 vertices in S \ (W  L).

Suppose that u0 is adjacent to s+k vertices u1, u2, . . . , us+k in S \(W L). Since ui  L,

for sufficiently large n, where the last inequality follows from the fact that  and  are small

e.g.,

and  <

.

So

there exist

(s + k)c

vertices

v1, v2, . . . v(s+k)c

in

T such that the induced subgraph by two partitions {u1, . . . , u(s+k)c} and {v1, . . . , v(s+k)c}

is complete bipartite. The subgraph of G formed by the vertex u0 together with such a

complete bipartite graph can contain many disjoint odd-length cycles. For example, we can

choose u0u1v1u0 to find a copy of triangle, and we can choose u0u1v1us+k+1v2u0 to form a

copy of pentagon and so on. Hence, it follows that G contains Hs,k, this is a contradiction.

Therefore u0 is adjacent to at most s + k - 1 vertices in S \ (W  L).

Hence, applying Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4 again, we have

Lemma 3.7. There exist independent sets IS  S and IT  T such that
|IS|  |S| - 20c2(s + k)2 and |IT |  |T | - 20c2(s + k)2.

Proof. Since S \L is large enough by reviewing (12) in the proof of Lemma 3.6, we next prove
that there exists a large complete bipartite subgraph between S and T . Let u1, . . . , u(s+k)c be (s + k)c vertices chosen arbitrarily from S \ L. Then ui / L which implies that

d(ui)

Note that W  L by Lemma 3.6, so ui / W , then dS(ui)  n. Hence

n > (s + k)c

for sufficiently large n. Hence there exist (s + k)c vertices v1, v2, . . . , v(s+k)c such that the subgraph formed by two partitions {u1, . . . , u(s+k)c} and {v1, . . . , v(s+k)c} is a complete bipartite graph.
Claim. G[S \ L] is both K1,s+k-free and Ms+k-free. Recall that G contains a large complete bipartite subgraph between S and T . If G[S \L]
contains a copy of K1,s+k centered at vertex u0 with leaves u1, u2, . . . , us+k, then by the discussion above, there exist ui and vj such that u0u1v1, u0u2v2, . . . , u0usvs form s triangles and v0us+1vs+1uivj · · · uxuyu0 forms an odd-length cycle and in fact we can find all other odd cycle similarly. Hence there is a Hs,k centered at u0. Therefore, G[S \ L] is K1,s+k-free. Now, we assume that {u1u2, u3u4, . . . , u2(s+k)-1u2(s+k)} is a matching of size s + k. Then u1u2v1, . . . , u2s-1u2svs form s triangles, and vs+1u2s+1u2s+2viuj · · · vxuyvs+1 forms an odd cycle and so on. So G[S \ L] is Ms+k-free.
Hence both the maximum degree and the maximum matching number of G[S \ L] are
at most s + k - 1, respectively. By Theorem 2.5,

e(G[S \ L])  f (s + k - 1, s + k - 1).

The same argument gives

e(G[T \ L])  f (s + k - 1, s + k - 1).

Since G[S \ L] has at most f (s + k - 1, s + k - 1) edges, then the subgraph obtained from G[S \ L] by deleting one vertex of each edge in G[S \ L] contains no edges, which is an independent set of G[S \ L]. By Lemma 3.4, there exists an independent set IS  S such that

|IS|  |S \ L| - f (s + k - 1, s + k - 1)  |S| - 16c2(s + k)2 - (s + k)2  |S| - 20c2(s + k)2.

The same argument gives that there is an independent set IT  T with |IT |  |T | - 20c2(s + k)2.

This completes the proof.

In

we

have

showed

that

there

are

two

with

(

vertices both in the sets S and T . Invoking this fact, we next shall prove that L is actually

an empty set.

11

Lemma 3.8. L is empty, and both G[S] and G[T ] are K1,s+k-free and Ms+k-free.

Proof. Recall that Ax = 1x and z is defined as a vertex with maximum eigenvector entry and satisfies xz = 1. So we have

d(z)

Hence z / L. Without loss of generality, we may assume that z  S. Since the maximum
degree in the induced subgraph G[S \ L] is at most s + k - 1 (containing no K1,s+k), from Lemma 3.4, we have |L|  16c2(s + k)2 and

dS(z) = dSL(z) + dS\L(z)  16c2(s + k)2 + s + k - 1  20c2(s + k)2.

Therefore, by Lemma 3.7, we have

where the last inequality holds for n large enough. This contradicts G has the largest
spectral radius over all Hs,k-free graphs, so L must be empty. Furthermore, the claim in the proof of Lemma 3.7 implies that both G[S] and G[T ] are K1,s+k-free and Ms+k-free.

Let G be a Hs,k-free graph on n vertices with maximum spectral radius. In the previous

Proof. From Lemma 3.8, both G[S] and G[T ] are K1,s+k-free and Ms+k-free. By lemma 2.5, so we have e(S) + e(T )  2f (s + k - 1, s + k - 1) < 2(s + k)2. This means that the number of triangles in G is bounded above by 2(s + k)2n since any triangle contains an edge
of E(S)  E(T ). By Lemma 2.2, we have

e(G)

Step 1. We first consider the case u  S. Since G[S] is K1,s+k-free, then dS(u)  s + k - 1. By Lemma 3.9, we have

From the above two cases, the result follows.

Using this refined bound on the eigenvector entries, we will show that the partition
V = S  T is balanced (Lemma 3.13). First of all, we fix some notation for convenience.
Let B = Ks,t be the complete bipartite graph with partite sets S and T , and let G1 = G[S]  G[T ] and G2 be the graph on V (G) with the missing edges between S and T , that is, E(G2) = E(B) \ E(G). Note that e(G) = e(G1) + e(B) - e(G2).
From Lemma 3.8, we know that both G[S] and G[T ] are K1,s+k-free and Ms+k-free, then e(G1) = e(S) + e(T )  2f (s + k - 1, s + k - 1)  2(s + k)2. Next we shall give an improvement in the sense that e(G2) is closed to zero.

15

Lemma 3.11. Let G1, G2 and B be graphs defined in above. Then e(G1) - e(G2)  (s + k - 1)2.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that |T |  |S| and denote by

S := {v  S : N (v)  T }, T  := {v  T : N (v)  S}.

Since e(G[S])  f (s + k - 1, s + k - 1)  (s + k)2 by Lemma 3.8, there exist at most 2(s + k)2 vertices in S having a neighbor in S. Hence

|S|  |S| - 2(s + k)2.

Similarly,

|T |  |T | - 2(s + k)2.

Let C  T  be a set having |T | - |S| vertices, which is well-defined since we can see from

Lemma

3.9

that

|T | - |S|

This is a contradiction for sufficiently large n. Therefore for n large enough we must have that ||S| - |T ||  1.

Recall that G is an Hs,k-free graph with the maximum spectral radius. Finally, we will show that e(G) = ex(n, Hs,k). In other words, G also attains the maximum number of edges among all Hs,k-free graphs.
Proof of Theorem 1.5. By way of contradiction, we may assume that e(G)  ex(n, Hs,k) - 1. By Lemma 3.13, we know that |S| - |T |  1. Let H be an Hs,k-free graph with ex(n, Hs,k) edges on the same vertex set as G such that the crossing edges between S and T span a complete bipartite graph in H, this is possible because every graph in Ex(n, Hs,k) has a maximum cut of size n2/4 by Theorem 1.3. Let E+ and E- be sets of edges such that E(G)E+ \E- = E(H), where E+ = E(H)\E(G) and E- = E(G)\E(H). Note that e(G) + |E+| - |E-| = e(H), which together with e(H)  e(G) + 1 implies that

|E+|  |E-| + 1.

Furthermore, we have that |E-|  e(G[S]) + e(G[T ]) < 2(s + k)2. By Lemma 3.9, we have

for sufficiently large n, where the last inequality follows by |E+| < 14(s + k)2. Therefore we have that for n large enough, (H) > (G), a contradiction. Hence e(G) = e(H). By Theorem 1.3, we know that G  Ex(n, Hs,k). The proof of Theorem 1.5 is complete.

4 Concluding remarks
To avoid unnecessary calculations, we did not attempt to get the best bound on the order of graphs in the proof. Our proof used the Triangle Removal Lemma, which means that the condition "sufficiently large n" is needed in our proof. It is interesting to determine how large n needs to be for our result.
Recently, Cioaba, Desai and Tait [8] investigated the largest spectral radius of an nvertex graph that does not contain the odd-wheel graph W2k+1, which is the graph obtained by joining a vertex to a cycle of length 2k. Moreover, they raised the following more general conjecture.
Conjecture 4.1. Let F be any graph such that the graphs in Ex(n, F ) are Tura´n graphs adding O(1) edges. Then for sufficiently large n, a graph attaining the maximum spectral radius among all F -free graphs is a member of Ex(n, F ).
We say that F is edge-color-critical if there exists an edge e of F such that (F - e) < (F ). Let F be an edge-color-critical graph with (F ) = r + 1. By a result of Simonovits [38] and a result of Nikiforov [35], we know that Ex(n, F ) = EXsp(n, F ) = {Tr(n)} for sufficiently large n, this shows that Conjecture 4.1 is true for all edge-color-critical graphs. As we mentioned before, Theorem 1.4 says that Conjecture 4.1 holds for the k-fan graph Fk. In addition, our main result (Theorem 1.5) tells us that Conjecture 4.1 also holds for the flower graph Hs,k. Note that both Fk and Hs,k are not edge-color-critical.
Let Sn,k be the graph consisting of a clique on k vertices and an independent set on n-k vertices in which each vertex of the clique is adjacent to each vertex of the independent set. Clearly, we can see that Sn,k does not contain Fk as a subgraph. Recently, Zhao, Huang and Guo [45] proved that Sn,k is the unique graph attaining the maximum signless Laplacian spectral radius among all graphs of order n containing no Fk for n  3k2 - k - 2. So it is a natural question to consider the maximum signless Laplacian spectral radius among all graphs containing no Ck,q, the graph defined as k cycles of odd-length q intersecting in a common vertex. We write q(G) for the signless Laplacian spectral radius, i.e., the largest eigenvalue of the signless Laplacian matrix Q(G) = D(G) + A(G), where D(G) = diag(d1, . . . , dn) is the degree diagonal matrix and A(G) is the adjacency matrix. We end with the following conjecture (Clearly, when t = 1, our conjecture reduces to the result of Zhao et al. [45]).
Conjecture 4.2. For integers k  2, t  1 and q = 2t + 1, there exists an integer n0(k, t) such that if n  n0(k, t) and G is a Ck,q-free graph on n vertices, then
q(G)  q(Sn,kt),
equality holds if and only if G = Sn,kt.
Another interesting problem on this topic is to determine the Tura´n number of Ck,q for even q. More general, it is challenging to determine the Tura´n number of Hs,k where the cycles have even lengths.
