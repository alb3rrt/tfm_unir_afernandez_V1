Photovoltaic Hall effect in two-dimensional electron gas: Kinetic theory
M. V. Durnev Ioffe Institute, 194021 St. Petersburg, Russia
We study theoretically transverse photoconductivity induced by circularly polarized radiation, i.e. the photovoltaic Hall effect, and linearly polarized radiation causing intraband optical transitions in two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). We develop a microscopic theory of these effects based on analytical solution of the Boltzmann equation for arbitrary electron spectrum and scattering mechanism. We calculate the transverse photoconductivity of 2DEG with parabolic and linear dispersion for short-range and Coulomb scatterers at different temperatures. We show that the transverse electric current is significantly enhanced at frequencies comparable to the inverse energy relaxation time, whereas at higher frequencies the excitation spectrum and the direction of current depend on the scattering mechanism. We also analyse the effect of thermalization processes caused by electron-electron collisions on the photoconductivity.

I. INTRODUCTION
Direct electric currents induced by high-frequency electric field in graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials are subject of active investigation in recent years1,2. In unbiased samples, the dc current is induced by oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the incident radiation through different mechanisms, including photothermoelectric3­5, photovoltaic and bolometric6, plasmonic7­9, photon drag10­12, bulk13­19 and edge20­22 photogalvanic effects. These mechanisms are relevant in 2D structures with broken space inversion symmetry ­ due to crystal lattice, p-n junctions, inhomogeneity of illumination, photon wave vector or edges. On the other hand, in a biased 2D layer, incident radiation may induce dc electric current, which flows in the direction perpendicular to the dc electric field, even if the system is spatialy isotropic. For circularly polarized radiation, the appearance of such a transverse current is reminiscent of the Hall effect, and hence, is termed as the photovoltaic Hall effect23.
The photo-induced anisotropy of conductivity was studied in early works in three-dimensional (3D) crystals and thin films24­27. It was shown that under illumination of a biased 3D crystal with circularly or linearly polarized electromagnetic wave the transverse dc current appears, which direction is controlled by the radiation polarization. The interest in transverse photoconductivity has been recently renewed with an advent of graphene and 2D materials. The photovoltaic Hall effect and transverse photoconductivity induced by linearly polarized radiation in 2D layers are being actively studied both theoretically23,28­30 and experimentally31­33.
The anisotropic photoconductivity in 2D materials has been studied so far for high-frequency radiation, which induces interband optical transitions between the valence and conduction bands in low-intensity regime29,30, and opens Floquet gaps in high-intensity regime23,34,35. With decreasing the frequency of radiation, e.g. to the terahertz range, the interband transitions in doped structures become forbidden and intraband (Drude-like) optical transitions in two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) come to play. The anisotropic photoconductivity of 2DEG in the low-frequency regime has been studied numerically28, whereas the analytical theory is missing.
Here, we study the photovoltaic Hall effect and transverse photoconductivity induced by linearly polarized ra-

diation caused by intraband optical transitions in 2DEG. The transverse electric current contains two contributions: The first one is due to alignment of electron momenta by ac and static electric fields, and the second one is due to the dynamic heating of 2DEG. We develop a microscopic theory of anisotropic photoconductivity based on solution of the Boltzmann equation for an arbitrary momentum dependence of the electron energy and arbitrary scattering mechanism. It allows one to apply the developed theory to a large class of 2D materials with linear, parabolic or Dirac energy dispersion, such as monolayer and bi-layer graphene, monolayers of TMDC and quantum wells. We show that the "heating" contribution is dominant in the frequency range 0 1, where  is the radiation frequency and 0 is the energy relaxation time. In this range, the transverse photoconductivity reaches  1 % of the "dark" conductivity of 2DEG at 1 W cm-2 of the radiation intensity. At 0 1 the transverse photoconductivity is determined by the relaxation times of the first and second angular harmonics of the distribution function and their energy derivatives. In this case, the excitation spectrum and even the sign of the transverse current are governed by the prevalent scattering mechanism. We also show that thermalization process caused by electron-electron collisions has a low impact on the photoconductivity at low temperatures, however may considerably alter the photoconductivity excitation spectrum with increasing temperature.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we formulate the model and present kinetic equations. In Sec. III we calculate transverse photoconductivity of 2DEG with parabolic energy dispersion. In Sec. IV we calculate transverse photoconductivity of 2DEG with an arbitrary energy dispersion and apply the derived results to analyze the photoconductivity of graphene. In Sec. V we study the role of thermalization process on the photoconductivity, and in Sec. VI we summarize the results.
II. MODEL AND KINETIC EQUATIONS
We consider 2DEG in the (xy) plane subject to in-plane oscillating electric field E(t) and static electric field F . In addition to the current along F , the oscillating and static fields create the direct electric current, which flows in the direction perpendicular to F . This transverse cur-

2

rent appears for circularly and linearly polarized field E(t) and changes its direction when the polarization sign is changed, see Fig. 1.
In general, the photo-induced dc current in isotropic 2DEG is determined by three constants j25
j = 1|E|2F + 2 [E(E · F ) + c.c] + i3 [F × [E × E]] . (1)
Here, 1 describes the change of isotropic conductivity under the action of radiation, whereas 2 and 3 describe the anisotropic photoconductivity induced by linearly and circularly polarized radiation, respectively. Below we calculate 2 and 3 due to intraband (Drude-like) optical transitions in 2DEG. Note, that Eq. (1) with no additional parameters also holds for 2DEG in high-symmetry 2D crystals, such as graphene.

Here p is the electron momentum, e is the electron charge, E(t) = E exp(-it) + c.c, the static electric field F is parallel to the x-axis, and St f is the collision integral. Equation (2) is valid for the classical regime, when  ¯, where ¯ is the mean electron energy.
We solve Eq. (2) analytically by expanding the distribution function f (p, t) in the series in the electric field amplitude as follows

f (p, t) = f0 + f¯1(p) + [f~1(p)e-it + c.c.] + f¯2(p) + [f~2(p)e-it + c.c.] + f¯3(p) . (3)

In the absence of electric field, the electron distribution

is equilibrium and described by the Fermi-Dirac function

f0 with chemical potential µ0 and temperature T0. The first order corrections f¯1  F and f~1  E determine linear (Drude) conductivity, responsible for dc electric cur-

rent. Considering the term e[F + E(t)] · f /p in Eq. (2)

the following collision integral:

The first term in the right-hand side of Eq. (5) describes
thermalization of the electron distribution towards the
Dirac-Fermi distribution fT caused by electron-electron collisions. The fT distribution is characterized by chemical potential µ and temperature T defined from the con-
servation of electron number and total energy p f = p fT and p f = p fT , where  is the electron en-
ergy. The thermalization is determined by the time ee. The second term in the right-hand side of Eq. (5) describes
the energy relaxation by phonons determined by the time
0. In what follows we consider ee and 0 independent of energy, but, generally, 0 and ee depend on temperature. Further, we consider a temperature range where
1,2 ee 0. This inequality is relevant for 2DEG at low temperatures, however may also hold at higher tem-
peratures, if the phonon-assisted energy relaxation is suppressed, as in the case of graphene36,37.

III. ELECTRON GAS WITH PARABOLIC DISPERSION

We start with calculating jy for parabolic energy dispersion of electrons (p) = p2/2m, where m is the effective mass, and p = |p|. This important limit also helps to clarify the basic physics of the effect. Calculating derivative in the right-hand side of Eq. (8) one obtains

Here (...) = (...)/, and we took into account that F x. Electric current (9) contains three contributions. The first one, proportional to vxvyf¯2, is related to the optical alignment of electron momenta by the oscillating electric field38­42. Optical alignment results in excess electrons and holes below Fermi level with velocities directed at /4 and 3/4 with respect to the x-axis. Together with the static electric field, which causes imbalance between charge carriers with vx > 0 and vx < 0, it results in a net y current. The second term in Eq. (9), proportional to (1) f~2, is related to the dynamic heating and cooling of 2DEG by the combined action of static and oscillating fields24. Electrons periodically gain and lose their energy with a rate proportional to (F · E) and oscillating in time at frequency . In turn, Ey component of the incident field drives the electrons along the y-direction. At the first and second half-periods of an oscillation cycle, both distribution of velocities and momentum relaxation times of electrons are different, which results in a net electric current. Finally, the third contribution to electric current (9) is related to dynamic optical alignment of charge carrier momenta by combined action of E(t) and F . The first and second contributions in Eq. (9) yield transverse photoconductivity for linearly polarized radiation with nonzero ExEy +ExEy, whereas the second and third contributions result in the photovoltaic Hall effect.
Solutions of Eqs. (4a), (4b) for the first order corrections to distribution function are

f¯1 = -e1(F · v)f0 ,

(10)

f~1 = -e1(E · v)f0 ,

where 1 = 1/(1 - i1). Substituting Eq. (10) in Eqs. (4c) and (4d) and solving the kinetic equations we

obtain for the second-order corrections

f¯2 = f¯2 + e2|E|22 (Re{1}f0) S1(vx2 - vy2) + 2S2vxvy ,

where S1 = (|Ex|2 - |Ey|2)/|E|2 and S2 = (ExEy + ExEy)/|E|2 are the Stokes parameters of the radiation polarization, 2 = 2/(1 - i2), and Re stands for real part. As seen from Eq. (11), the functions f¯2 and f~2 are sums of the zeroth and second angular harmonics in momentum space. Further in this section, we neglect thermalization by setting ee   in Eq. (5), and hence find f~2 = -e0 F · f~1/p + E · f¯1/p from Eq. (4d). As shown in Sec. V, the neglect of thermalization is eligible at low temperatures of 2DEG.

where  = (2 - i1)/(1 - i1), 0 = e2n1/m is the "dark" conductivity of 2DEG, n = gmF /(2 2) is the electron density, and all energy dependent quantities are
taken at the Fermi energy F . Equation (13) can be applied to different scattering mechanisms of 2D electrons
characterized by the energy dependence of 1 and 2. Particularly, it is seen that short-range scattering yielding
1 and 2 independent of energy does not contribute to the transverse photoconductivity of 2DEG with parabolic
spectrum. Figure 2 shows the photoconductivity xy = 2,3|E|2
calculated after Eq. (13) with 1 = 22   corresponding to unscreened Coulomb scatterers. The parameters used
for calculations are given in the caption of Fig. 2 and correspond approximately to bi-layer graphene21. The curves are calculated for I = 1 W/cm2, where I = cn|E|2/2 is the intensity of radiation, and n is the refraction index of the medium surrounding 2DEG. At 0 1 the photoconductivity is dominated by the first contribution in

4

Eq. (13) related to the heating mechanism. This contribution is on the order of 0, where  = e2|E|210/(mF ) is the dimensionless parameter. Its value is   7 × 10-3
for used parameters. The heating contribution decays at
first within the narrow frequency range 0  1. At 0 1 the heating contribution and the second contribution in Eq. (13) related to optical alignment are
comparable. They both decay within a much wider fre-
quency range 1  1, and the photoconductivity is determined by the interplay of both. In this frequency range xy/0  1/0  7 × 10-5. Interestingly, interplay of two contributions may result in the change of transverse
current sign with increasing frequency, as illustrated in
Fig. 2.

IV. ELECTRON GAS WITH AN ARBITRARY DISPERSION

Let us now calculate transverse photoconductivity for an arbitrary energy dispersion of electrons (|p|). We introduce an energy-dependent effective electron mass m() = p/v, where p = |p| and v = /p. We start with the general Eq. (8) for the current. After calculating the derivatives in the right-hand side of Eq. (8) one obtains

Equation (16) is general and can be used to calculate
anisotropic photoconductivity of 2DEG with arbitrary en-
ergy dispersion (p) and for arbitrary energy dependence
of relaxation times. For parabolic dispersion, m is energyindependent, mv2/2 = , and Eq. (16) is reduced to
Eq. (13) obtained in Sec. III. For linear dispersion  = v0p, relevant to graphene, one has m = /v02 and mv2 = . For 1 = 22  -1 corresponding to scattering at the shortrange potential in graphene Eq. (16) yields

terers, 0 is a parameter. Note that the heating contribution vanishes in graphene with short-range scatterers,
and hence the photoconductivity (17) is independent of
0. However, the addition of Coulomb centers restores the heating contribution and significantly enhances the
photoconductivity at 0 1. Note that scattering solely at Coulomb centers yields 1,2   resulting in xy = 0. The values of xy/0 at 0 1 are about an order of

5

magnitude larger in monolayer graphene than in bi-layer graphene, see Fig. 2, due to the smaller effective mass of electrons in graphene.

V. ROLE OF FINITE TEMPERATURE AND THERMALIZATION

In this section we calculate the transverse photoconductivity of 2DEG at finite temperature. At finite temperature the distribution function of 2DEG is smeared over energy and thermalization process caused by electronelectron collisions affects the kinetics of the zeroth angular harmonic f of the distribution function. We describe this kinetics by the collision integral (5). We assume that, in the absence of external fields F = 0, E = 0, the temperature of 2DEG is T0 and its chemical potential µ0. Heating or cooling of the gas by combined action of incident radiation and static electric field and fast electron-electron collisions result in a different temperature T and chemical potential µ of electron subsystem. Further, we discuss the thermalization of the oscillating correction f~2 exp(-it) + c.c. to the distribution function of 2D electrons, since this correction determines the heating contribution to the current in Eq. (14). Therefore, T and µ also oscillate with frequency .
To determine T one should calculate the change of the total electron energy E(t) at a given moment of time and consider how it is redistributed between thermalized electrons. The change of the total electron energy is

E = (f - f0) = [fT (µ, T ) - f0] , (18)

because p f = p fT (µ, T ). Assuming T /T0 1,

(27)

Equation (24) allows one to calculate the transverse photoconductivity of 2DEG at a given temperature T0. At T0 = 0, one has p AQ/ p A = Q (µ0) and, as

6

follows from Eq. (25), H(µ0) = Q (µ0). In that case, thermalization does not affect the photoconductivity, and 2,3 coincide with those given by Eq. (16). Figure 4 presents the transverse photoconductivity xy = 2,3|E|2 calculated after Eq. (24) for graphene. Calculations are done for a fixed electron density defined by the Fermi energy F = 10 meV, and two temperatures T0 = F and T0 = 3F . The corresponding values of the chemical potential are µ0  -5.7 meV and µ0  -86 meV, respectively. The latter case corresponds to the Boltzmann distribution of electrons. Thermalization of electrons starts to play a role at T0  F . As blue and red curves in Fig. 4 show, both circular and linear photoconductivities are suppressed by thermalization at ee 1, and this suppression becomes stronger with increase of temperature. However, such a suppression is not a general behaviour. Thermalization aims to redistribute electrons over energy and it may cause either suppression or enhancement of the photoconductivity depending on how electron velocity and relaxation time 1 depend on energy. For instance, in the case of parabolic dispersion and Coulomb scatterers shown in Fig. 2, the thermalization does not affect xy at all, because in that case H given by Eq. (25) is independent of energy.

VI. SUMMARY
To summarize, we have studied the transverse photoconductivity of 2DEG caused by intraband absorption of circularly and linearly polarized radiation. The transverse dc current has two contributions: (i) due to the optical alignment of electron momenta and (ii) due to the dynamic heating and cooling of 2DEG. The heating contribution is dominant at low frequencies 0 1, where 0 is the energy relaxation time. In this range, the transverse photoconductivity reaches  1 % of the "dark" conductivity of 2DEG at 1 W cm-2 of the radiation intensity. At higher frequencies, the transverse current is determined by the relaxation of the first and second angular harmonics of the distribution function. We have developed the microscopic theory of transverse photoconductivity for arbitrary electron spectrum and scattering mechanism. The value and the sign of the calculated photoconductivity of 2DEG with parabolic and linear energy dispersion significantly depend on the scattering mechanism. Further, we have shown that thermalization processes caused by electron-electron collisions have a negligible impact on transverse photoconductivity of a nearly degenerate 2DEG, but may contribute considerably at higher temperatures, when the Boltzmann distribution is formed.
