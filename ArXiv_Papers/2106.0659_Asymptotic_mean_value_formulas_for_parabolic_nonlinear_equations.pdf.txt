ASYMPTOTIC MEAN VALUE FORMULAS FOR PARABOLIC NONLINEAR EQUATIONS
PABLO BLANC, FERNANDO CHARRO, JUAN J. MANFREDI, AND JULIO D. ROSSI
Abstract. In this paper we characterize viscosity solutions to nonlinear parabolic equations (including parabolic Monge-Amp`ere equations) by asymptotic mean value formulas. Our asymptotic mean value formulas can be interpreted from a probabilistic point of view in terms of Dynamic Programming Principles for certain two-player, zero-sum games.

1. Introduction
1.1. Asymptotic mean value formulas for elliptic equations. It is a classical well-known fact that a function u is harmonic (u is a solution to u = trace(D2u) = 0) in a domain   Rn if and only if u satisfies the mean value property

u(x) = - u(y) dy
B (x)

(1.1)

for each x   and all 0 <  < dist(x, ). In fact, a weaker statement, an asymptotic version of the mean value property, suffices to characterize harmonic functions. A continuous function u is harmonic in  if and only if

u(x) = - u(y) dy + o(2) as   0,
B(x)

(1.2)

see [7, 23, 33]. Moreover, the mean value property can be used to characterize sub- and superhar-

monic functions replacing the equality by the appropriate inequality in (1.1) and (1.2). A discrete version of the asymptotic mean value property also holds; a continuous function u is harmonic if

and only if

where {e1, . . . , en} is the canonical basis of Rn. There are many other mean value formulas for linear elliptic operators other than the Laplacian, see [27], and for degenerate elliptic equations,

see [8].

In recent years asymptotic mean value formulas were found for nonlinear operators such as the normalized (also called homogeneous) p-Laplacian,

Np u = |u|2-p div |u|p-2u = u + (p - 2) Nu,

for 1 < p < . These mean value formulas come from the connection between probability (via the dynamic programming principle for Tug-of-War games) and the normalized infinity Laplacian, see [24, 25, 31]. A nonlinear mean value property for p-harmonic functions first appeared in [28] motivated by the Random Tug-of-War games with noise in [32]. It was proved in [28] that pharmonic functions are characterized by the fact that they satisfy the following asymptotic mean value formula

 max u + min u 

u(x) =

(1.3)

in the viscosity sense. The asymptotic mean value formula (1.3) holds in the viscosity sense if whenever a smooth test function with non-vanishing gradient touches u from above (respectively below) at a point x, the mean value formula (1.3) is satisfied with  (respectively ) for the test function at x. This is weaker than requiring the asymptotic formula to hold in the classical sense, yet enough to characterize p-harmonic functions. For mean value properties for the p-Laplacian in the Heisenberg group see [16] and for the standard variational p-Laplacian, see [14]. See also [2] and the recently published book [5] for historical references and more general equations.
It is worth noting that the expression

in the asymptotic mean value property (1.3) has a game-theoretic interpretation for which it is essential that the coefficients are positive and add up to 1, so that they play the role of conditional probabilities.
For asymptotic mean value properties for the elliptic Monge-Amp`ere equation

det D2u = f in 

(1.4)

we refer to our recent paper [4]. For the equation to fit into the framework of the theory of fully nonlinear elliptic equations, one must look for convex solutions u to ensure that det(D2u) is indeed a monotone function of D2u. Thus, one requires the right-hand side f (x) to be non-negative. See

[9, 10]. Moreover, the Monge-Amp`ere equation can be expressed as an infimum of a family of linear

operators as follows,

det D2u(x)

=

1 n

inf trace(AtD2u(x)A).

Let () be a positive function such that

Then, a convex function u  C() is a viscosity solution of the Monge-Amp`ere equation (1.4) if and only if for every x   we have

Concerning mean value formulas for the heat equation we refer also to [40] and [1]. For a version

with variable coefficients, see [15] and for a proof of the rigidity of the formula see [22, 34].

It turns out there is a simpler asymptotic mean value formula where we only need to integrate

Equivalently, the asymptotic mean value formula

t-2 B(x)

holds in the viscosity sense if and only if u is a solution to

(n + 2) ut(x, t) = u(x, t).

For the normalized parabolic p-Laplacian it is convenient to write the equation in the form

(n + p) ut(x, t) = |u|2-ppu(x, t).

(1.6)

This equation has been studied in [29], where a game approximation (that leads to an asymptotic mean value formula) was analyzed. Namely, a function u solves (1.6) if and only if the following expansion holds in the viscosity sense

Our main goal is to obtain mean value formulas for parabolic versions of the Monge-Amp`ere equation and other nonlinear parabolic equations.

mula holds for two different parabolic versions of the Monge-Amp`ere equation. The first one reads

as   0 for x  , t  (t1, t2), in the viscosity sense.

For the precise definition of a viscosity solution and the statement of a mean value formula in the viscosity sense we refer to Section 3 (see also [12] and [28]). Informally, an equation or a mean value property holds in the viscosity sense when it holds with the appropriate inequality instead of an equality for smooth functions that touch u from above or from below at (x, t).
The mean value property (2.2) involves an average of u both in space and in time. Notice the parabolic character of the time average in formula (2.2), where we are integrating over a time interval of length comparable to 2.

Remark 2.2. We assume without loss of generality that the matrices A that appear throughout this paper are symmetric and positive definite. This assumption is not restrictive since we can use the (unique) left polar decomposition of A, namely A = SQ (where Q is orthogonal and S is a positive definite symmetric matrix) and consider S instead of a general matrix A in our formulas.

Remark 2.3. The concept of a mean value formula in the viscosity sense is weaker than a mean
value formula that holds in a pointwise sense. In fact, there are examples of asymptotic mean value
formulas that hold in the viscosity sense but do not hold pointwise, like the ones that hold for the
infinity Laplacian, see [28], and for the elliptic Monge-Amp`ere equation, see [4]. When a solution to the involved equation is smooth, u(x, t)  C2,1, the mean value property holds pointwise. This is a consequence of the fact that for C2,1 functions we have formula (2.2) in the classical pointwise
sense.

and appears in connection with the movement of a hypersurface by Gauss-Kronecker curvature, see [36]. For the study of this equation we refer to [20, 41, 42] and concerning regularity of the solutions to [19, 35, 38, 39]. The asymptotic behavior at infinity of global solutions has been studied in [37].
In order for the general viscosity theory to work in this case, one has to restrict to solutions that are parabolically convex. A function u :  × (t1, t2)  R, is parabolically convex if it is continuous, convex in x, and non-increasing in t. Therefore, we assume that the right-hand side f is nonnegative.
Our next result shows that there is also a mean value formula in this case.

lim () =  and lim  () = 0.

2.2. Bounded Operators.

2.2.1. Infimum operators. Let us start with the differential operator F :  × R × R × Sn(R)  R

given by

(2.5)

Here Ax,t  Sn+(R) × R+ is a bounded subset for each point (x, t)  Rn × R+ and Sn+(R) denotes the set of symmetric positive semi-definite matrices. Examples of these operators include parabolic

equations related to Pucci operators and evolution problems associated with the convex envelope.

See Section 5 below for details.

Our next result gives an asymptotic mean value formula that characterizes viscosity solutions of

the corresponding homogeneous equation.

Observe that an analogous statement holds for suprema, and hence, we can tackle operators of

Remark 2.8. Since the sets Ax,t are bounded, the formula is local. In fact, for every x  , t  (t1, t2) there exists C = C(x, t) > 0 such that A  CI and b  C for every (A, b)  Ax,t and we get

2.2.2. Supremum-Infimum operators. Our next step is to consider a special type of Isaacs operators where the supremum (or the infimum) is taken over a subset Ax,t of the parts of Sn+(R) × R+. To be more precise, let Ax,t  P(Sn+(R) × R+) be a subset for each x  , t  (t1, t2) such that

Ax,t = (A, b)  Sn+(R) × R+ : (A, b)  A for some A  Ax,t

is bounded. We consider the differential operator F :  × R × R × Sn(R)  R given by

3. Preliminaries

In this section we set the notation, recall basic results on the Monge-Amp`ere equation, and state some definitions. We begin by stating the definition of a viscosity solution to a fully nonlinear second order parabolic PDE. We refer to [12] for general results on viscosity solutions.
Given a continuous function

F :  × R × R × Sn(R)  R

where Sn(R) denotes the set of symmetric n × n matrices, we consider the PDE

F

u t

(x,

(3.1)

Viscosity

solutions

use

the

monotonicity

of

F

in

D2u

(ellipticity)

and

in

u t

in

order

to

evaluate

the equation for smooth test functions and obtain sub- and supersolution inequalities.

Definition 3.1. A lower semi-continuous function u is a viscosity supersolution of (3.1) if for every   C2,1 such that  touches u at (x, t)   × (t1, t2) strictly from below (that is, u -  has a strict
minimum at (x, t) with u(x, t) = (x, t)), we have

F

x,

t,

 t

(x,

t),

D2(x,

t)

 0.

An upper semi-continuous function u is a subsolution of (3.1) if for every   C2,1 such that 

touches u at (x, t)   × (t1, t2) strictly from above (that is, u -  has a strict maximum at (x, t) with u(x, t) = (x, t)), we have

F

x,

t,

 t

(x,

t),

D2(x,

t)

 0.

Finally, u is a viscosity solution of (3.1) if it is both a super- and a subsolution.

To apply this definition to the parabolic Monge-Amp`ere equation (2.1) we have to consider the operator

F

x,

t,

u t

(x,

t),

D2u(x,

t)

=

  

u t

(x,

t)

-

(det

(D2u(x,

t)))1/n

-

f

(x,

t)

-

if D2u(x, t)  0 otherwise.

This is equivalent to requiring the function to be convex in the space variable and restricting the test functions to paraboloids convex in space. Similarly, for solutions to equation (2.3) we require the function to be parabolically convex (convex in x and non-increasing in t) and restrict the test functions to parabolically convex paraboloids, defined next.

Definition 3.2. A C2,1 function P (x, t) is a parabolic paraboloid if and only if it coincides with its second order Taylor expansion in x and first order in t, i.e., we have

P

(x,

t)

=

P (x0,

t0)

+

P t

(x0,

t0)(t

-

t0)

+

P (x0, t0), (x - x0)

+

1 2

D2P (x0, t0)(x - x0), (x - x0)

for any given (x0, t0). Furthermore, P (x, t) is a parabolically convex paraboloid if and only if

P t

 0 and D2P

 0.

We will also need the definition of an asymptotic mean value formula in the viscosity sense. First, recall that given a constant c and a real function g we write
c  g() + o(2) as   0
7

whenever we have and

lim
0

[c

- g()]+ 2

=

0,

c  g() + o(2) as   0

whenever we have

lim
0

[c

- g()]- 2

=

0.

In the next definition M (u, )(x) stands for a mean value operator (that depends on the parameter

) applied to u at the point x. As an example, consider

t
M (u, )(x, t) = inf - - u(x + Ay, s) dy ds.
(A,b)Ax,t t-b 2 B(0)

Definition 3.3. A continuous function u verifies

u(x, t) = M (u, )(x, t) + o(2), as   0,

in the viscosity sense if

(1) for every   C2,1 such that u -  has a strict minimum at the point (x, t)   × (t1, t2) with u(x, t) = (x, t), we have

0  -(x, t) + M (, )(x, t) + o(2).

(2) for every   C2,1 such that u -  has a strict maximum at the point (x, t)   × (t1, t2) with u(x, t) = (x, t), we have

0  -(x, t) + M (, )(x, t) + o(2).

The following elementary fact will be used several times in the sequel.

For symmetric square matrices, A > 0 means positive definite and A  0 means positive semi-
definite. We will denote i(A) the eigenvalues of A, in particular min(A) and max(A) are the smallest and largest eigenvalues, respectively. We have the following linear algebra facts.

Lemma 3.5. Let M be symmetric and M  0. Then, inf trace(AtM A) = n(det(M ))1/n.
det A=1
On the other hand, if M has negative eigenvalues, then the infimum is -.

For a proof of Lemma 3.5 we refer to [4].

Lemma 3.6. Let M > 0. Then, for every

(det M )1/n min(M )

we have

inf trace AtM A = inf trace(AtM A).

det A=1

Proof. In general, the right-hand side is larger than the left-hand side as we are taking infimum

over an smaller

set.

The infimum is realized

for

A

=

1
(det M ) 2n

M -1/2.

Then the result follows

since A  0I.

Lemma 3.7. For M > 0 we have (det (M ± I))1/n = (det M )1/n + O()

as   0.

(3.4)

For M  0 we have (det (M + I))1/n = (det M )1/n + O()

as   0.

(3.5)

Proof. To see this, first notice that
n
det (M ± I) = det M + (±)kn-k(M ),
k=1
where the coefficients n-k(M ) in the expansion are given by the elementary symmetric polynomials on the eigenvalues of M , which are positive. Therefore,

(det M - C)1/n  (det (M ± I))1/n  (det M + C)1/n

for some C > 0. Then, the Mean Value Theorem applied to g(t) = t1/n, with a = det M and b = det M + C gives that there exists   (a, b) such that

(det M + C)1/n = g(b) = g(a) + g()(b - a)  (det M )1/n + C.

Similarly, we obtain that

(det M - C)1/n  (det M )1/n - C

and (3.4) follows.

It remains to prove (3.5) in the case det M = 0. In this case the upper bound obtained is still at our disposal. Therefore we conclude by observing that (det (M + I))1/n  0.

Lemma 3.8. For M > 0 we have inf trace(At(M ± I)A)  n (det M )1/n
det A=1 A()I
For M  0 we have
inf trace(At(M + I)A)  n (det M )1/n
det A=1 A()I

as ,   0. as ,   0.

Proof. For M > 0, we consider  < min{1, min(M )/2}, we have

(det M ± I)1/n

1/2


(det M + I)1/n

min(M ± I)

min(M )/2)

1/2
= 0.

Then, for 0 such that for every  < 0 we have () > 0 combining Lemma 3.6 and Lemma 3.5 we get
inf trace(At(M ± I)A) = n (det M ± I)1/n .
det A=1 A()I
The result follows from equation (3.4).
It remains to prove the case det(M ) = 0. Given  > 0, by Lemma 3.5 there exists A0 with det(A0) = 1 such that
trace(At0M A0) < .
9

Then, for  such that A0  ()I we have

inf
det A=1

trace(At(M

trace(At0(M

I )A0 )

A()I

and by (3.5) for  small enough we get

4. Parabolic Monge-Amp`ere

4.1. First version. Let us start with the equation

u t

(x,

t)

=

(det

(D2u(x,

t)))1/n

+

f

(x,

t).

(4.1)

Our goal is to show that u is a viscosity solution of the Monge-Amp`ere equation (4.1) if and only if

u(x, t) = inf
det(A)=1 A()I

B(0)

n 2(n +

+

o(2)

as   0 for x   in the viscosity sense.

We first prove the asymptotic mean value property under the restriction that solutions of the Monge-Amp`ere equation are classical (C2,1 solutions) and then we deal with the general case
(viscosity solutions). We start by proving the result for smooth strictly convex functions (with
strictly positive definite Hessian). We proceed with the proof of Theorem 2.1.

Proof of Theorem 2.1. As we have mentioned, first we prove the result for classical solutions. Assume that u is C2,1, convex in space and a solution to
u (x, t) = (det (D2u(x, t)))1/n + f (x, t). t

We use the Taylor expansion of u(y, s), given by

u(y,

s)

=

u(x,

t)

+

u t

(x,

t)(s

-

t)

+

u(x, t), (y - x)

+

1 2

D2u(x, t)(y - x), (y - x)

+ o(|t - s| + |x - y|2),

to define the parabolic paraboloid

P

(y,

s)

=

u(x,

t)

+

u t

(x,

t)(s

-

t)

+

u(x, t), (y - x)

+

1 2

D2u(x, t)(y - x), (y - x) .

Since u  C2,1, we have

u(y, s) - P (y, s) = o(|y - x|2 + |t - s|) as y  x, s  t,

which means that for every  > 0, there exists  > 0 such that

P (y, s) - 

|y

- x|2 2

+

|t

-

s|

 u(y, s)  P (y, s) + 

|y

- x|2 2

+

|t

-

s|

for every (y, s)  B(x) × (t - , t + ). For convenience, we denote

P±(y, s) = P (y, s) ± 

|y - x|2 + |t - s| 2

.

10

Let us assume first that D2u(x, t) > 0. We have

Observe that A  ()I and |y|   imply x + Ay  B(x) for  < 0 (since ()  0 as   0). Therefore, given  > 0 if  < 0, we have
P-(x + Ay, s)  u(x + Ay, s)  P+(x + Ay, s) for every y  B(0).

From here, the result follows from Lemma 3.8 since both the upper and lower bound involve an expression that converges to

-

u t

(x,

+

(det

(D2u(x,

t)))1/n

=

-f (x,

t)

as   0.

Now, if det(D2u(x, t)) = 0, then we use a minor modification of the above argument. The upper bound is still at our disposal but we have to obtain a new lower bound. Here we use the convexity in space of u to get

inf
det(A)=1 A()I

and the result follows.
For the viscosity case, it is enough to use convex (in space) smooth functions as test functions in the definition of viscosity solution. Let u(x, t) be a viscosity solution to

u t

(x,

t)

=

(det

(D2u(x,

t)))1/n

+

f

(x,

t).

Take (x, t) a C2,1 function, convex in space that touches u from above at (x, t), that is, we have

u(y, s) - (y, s)  u(x, t) - (x, t), for every |y - x|  a, t - a  s  t.

The fact that u is a viscosity solution implies

 t

(x,

t)

-

(det(D2(x,

t)))1/n



f (x,

t).

On the other hand, from our previous computations, using that   C2,1, we obtain

t

inf -

- (x + Ay, s) dy ds - (x, t)

det(A)=1 A()I

t-

n n+2

-

n 2(n +

An analogous computation shows that (x, t) a C2,1 convex function that touches u from below at (x, t) verifies

det(A)=1 A()I

This proves that a viscosity solution to the PDE verifies the asymptotic mean value formula in the viscosity sense.
For the converse, let u be a convex function that verifies the asymptotic mean value property in the viscosity sense. Take (x, t) a convex smooth function that touches u from above at (x, t), then we have

u(y, s) - u(x, t)  (y, s) - (x, t), for every |y - x|  a, t - a  s  t.
12

Since u verifies the asymptotic mean value property in the viscosity sense, we have

Using again our previous computations for a C2,1 function, we obtain

(det(D2(x,

Taking the limit as   0 we obtain

 t

(x,

t)

-

(det(D2(x,

+

f

(x,

 0.

This proves that u is a viscosity subsolution to the parabolic Monge-Amp`ere equation.
To prove that u is a viscosity supersolution we proceed in a similar way, touching u from below with a convex smooth function  and using the asymptotic mean value property with the reverse inequality.

Remark 4.1. Using (3.2),

trace(M )

=

n 2

- My, y
 B (0)

dHn-1(y),

instead of (3.3), we can obtain an asymptotic mean value formula involving means over surfaces of ellipsoids: u is a viscosity solution of the parabolic Monge-Amp`ere equation (4.1) if and only if

u(x, t) = inf
det(A)=1 A()I

t

as   0 for x   and t  (t1, t2), in the viscosity sense.

Remark 4.2. We can also deal with equations with coefficients such as

a(x,

t)

u t

(x,

t)

=

b(x,

t)(det(D2u(x,

t))1/n

+

c(x,

t)f

(x,

(see [13]). In this case we obtain an asymptotic mean value property of the form

u(x, t) = inf
det(A)=1 A()I

as   0 for x   and t  (t1, t2) with an appropriate choice of k1(x, t) and k2(x, t).

4.2. Second version. Now we deal with

-

u t

·

det

D2u(x, t)

= f (x, t)

(4.2)

and our goal is to prove Theorem 2.5, that is, to show that viscosity solutions to (4.2) are characterized by the asymptotic mean value formula

13

Proof of Theorem 2.5. Let us first prove the result for classical solutions. Assume that u is C2,1, convex in space, non-increasing in t, and a solution to

-

u t

(x,

t)

·

det

D2u(x, t)

= f (x, t).

As in the proof of Theorem 2.1, we define the parabolic paraboloid

P

(y,

=

u(x,

t)

+

u t

(x,

t)(s

-

t)

+

u(x, t), (y - x)

+

1 2

D2u(x, t)(y - x), (y - x) .

Since u  C2,1, the Taylor expansion of u(y, s) yields

u(y, s) - P (y, s) = o(|y - x|2 + |t - s|) as y  x, s  t,

which means that for every  > 0, there exists  > 0 such that

P (y, s) -

 u(y, s)  P (y, s) +

for every (y, s)  B(x) × (t - , t + ). For convenience, we denote

P±(y, s) = P (y, s) ±

= 0.

(5.1)

Here Ax,t  Sn+(R) × R+ are bounded subsets for each x  R and t  [t1, t2]. Observe that we are assuming that the sets Ax,t are bounded. This has to be contrasted to the
previous case, the Monge-Amp`ere case, where the set of relevant matrices Ax = {A  Sn+(R) : det(A) = 1} is unbounded.
The fact that we are taking a bounded set of coefficients in (5.1) is equivalent to assuming that F is well defined and finite.
16

Lemma 5.1. The operator F (x, t, z, M ) = inf trace(AtM A) - bz
(A,b)Ax,t
is finite for every M  Sn(R) and every z  R if and only if Ax,t is bounded.

Proof. Suppose that Ax,t is not bounded. First, assume that there exists a sequence of matrices Ak  Ax such that their largest eigenvalue k diverges. Let vk be the corresponding unitary eigenvectors. Since vk are unitary vectors, we can extract a subsequence (denoted equal) that has a limit, that is, vk  v. Let M be the symmetric matrix with eigenvector v of eigenvalue -1 and eigenvalue 0 with multiplicity n - 1. Then
trace(AtkM Ak)  -2k projv(vk) + 2k projv (vk) .
Which is a contradiction since the RHS goes to -. Next, if the set Ax,t contains an unbounded set of b. If bk  +, we just take z = -1 and if
bk  - then take z = 1, to obtain the contradiction.

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 2.7.

Proof of Theorem 2.7. As in the previous proofs, let us use the Taylor expansion of u(y, s),

u(y,

s)

=

u(x,

t)

+

u t

(x,

t)(s

-

t)

+

u(x, t), (y - x)

+

1 2

D2u(x, t)(y - x), (y - x)

+ o(|t - s| + |x - y|2).

Notice that now, since the set of involved coefficients (matrices) are bounded then the error terms in the Taylor expansion are uniform, therefore we can avoid the use of paraboloids here.
As before, we start with the proof of the case in which the solution u is a classical C2,1 solution. We have

t

-

- u(x + Ay, s) dy ds - u(x, t)

At(D2u(x, t))Ay, y

dy

=

2 n+

trace(At(D2u(x,

proving the asymptotic mean value formula in a pointwise sense for smooth solutions.
As a consequence of the mean value property for smooth functions we can obtain the characterization for viscosity solutions in Theorem 2.7. The details are left to the reader.

Examples. Let us mention some examples of operators and the corresponding set of matrices A such that the previous results apply. To that end we denote 1(M )  2(M )  · · ·  n(M ) the eigenvalues of the matrix M , or simply i when the matrix involved is clear from the context.
Parabolic equations related to Pucci operators. An important example under these assumptions are the parabolic Pucci operators. For given 0 <  < , consider the second order, uniformly parabolic operators,

i(D2u) + 

i(D2u) .

i (D2 u)>0

i (D2 u)<0

In this case, we have as the involved set of matrices

The evolution problem associated with the convex envelope, 1(D2u). Notice, however,

that the operators that satisfy (2.5) do not need to be uniformly elliptic. For example, the operator

studied in [3] in connection with the convex envelope of a function, corresponds to the set of matrices

5.2. Sup-Inf operators. We also consider a special type of Isaacs operators where for every x the supremum (or the infimum) is taken over a subset Ax,t of the parts of S+n (R) × R+. More precisely, let Ax,t  P(S+n (R) × R+) be a subset for each x  Rn and t > 0 such that
Ax,t = (A, b)  Sn+(R) × R+ : (A, b)  A for some A  Ax,t

is bounded. We consider the differential operator F :  × R × R × Sn(R)  R given by

We leave the details to the reader.

Examples. As examples of operators such that the previous results apply we mention the following:

Evolution problems associated with eigenvalues of the Hessian. This allows us to prove asymptotic mean value formulas for degenerate parabolic operators such as

u t

=

k (D2 u)

that where studied in [3]. Here k(D2u) stands for the k-th smallest eigenvalue of the Hessian, given by the Courant­Fischer min-max principle

k D2u(x)

= min

min

dim(V )=n-k+1 vV

D2u(x)v, v .

|v|=1

For example, for the operator 2(D2u) we have the set of sets of matrices

A = {A  Sn+(R) : 1 = · · · = n-1 = 0, n = 1 and vn  V } : V a subspace of dimension n - 1 .

In this case the asymptotic mean value formula is given by

u(x, t) = sup

6. A probabilistic interpretation.

The asymptotic mean value formulas that we obtained can be interpreted in terms of Dynamic Programming Principles for two-player zero-sum games.

First, we describe a closely related random walk. For a small  > 0 and a fixed matrix A consider

the following random walk in a bounded domain T =  × (0, T ). From (x, t) the next spacial

position is given by x + Ay with y  B chosen with uniform distribution in the ball and the new

time

is

t-

b 2(n+2)

2

.

The

process

continues

until

the

spacial

position

leaves

the



or

when

the

time

becomes nonpositive. We call  the stopping time given by the number of plays until the position

of the game leaves T and call (x , t ) the last position of the process. We have (x , t )  T , even more, (x , t )  cT := Rn × (-, T ) \ T .
We fix a final payoff functions g : cT  R and we define

v(x, t) = Ex,t[g(x , t )].

Then, it follows that v verifies

v(x, t) = - v

for x  , t > 0. That is, the expected final payoff starting at (x, t) is equal to the average of the
expectation over all the possible next positions.
Next we describe the two-player zero-sum game. We are given Ax,t  P(S+n (R) × (0, +)) for each (x, t)  T . The game starts at (x0, t0)  T , the first player, Player I, chooses a set of matrices and scalars A  Ax,t (she chooses a casino in probabilistic terms) and next the second player, Player II, chooses a a matrix and a scalar (A, b)  A (she chooses a game to play in the
casino chosen by Player I). The next position of the game is given by the previously described
random walk, that is,

x1 = x0 + Ay

with y  B being chosen according to the uniform distribution in B and

t1

=

t0

-

b

2(n

1 +

2) 2.

The game continues from x1 accordingly to the same rules. The game finishes at the first time at which the position (x , t ) leaves T . At this point, Player I gets g(x , t ) and Player II gets -g(x , t ) (one can think that Player II pays to Player I the amount given by the final payoff).
When the two players decide what to play at each turn (they choose theirs strategies), we can compute expected payoff (the expected earnings for Player I) playing with strategies SI and SII starting at (x, t)  T as
ExS,It,SII [g(x , t )].
Then, the extreme values for this game are given by

uI

(x,

t)

=

inf
SII

ExS,It,SII

[g(x

t

)]

and

uI I

(x,

t)

=

sup
SI

inf
SII

ExS,It,SII

[g(x

,

t

)].

We are taking sup and inf over the strategies for Player I and Player II respectively since Player I
wants to maximize the value of g(x , t ) while Player II is trying to minimize it. When these two extreme values coincide, we say that the game has a value given by

u(x, t) := uII(x, t) = uI (x, t).

It turns out that u(x, t) is a solution to the Dynamic Programming Principle associated to this game that reads as

u(x, t) = sup inf - u x + Ay, t - b 1 2 dy.

where the reader can recognize the left-hand side of (2.6) without the error term.

For the mean value formulas associated with Monge-Amp`ere operators we just consider a game with only one player (a controller) that chooses at each point the parameters involved in the random
