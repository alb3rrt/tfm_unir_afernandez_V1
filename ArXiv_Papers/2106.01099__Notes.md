## Abstract

Quantum computers are reaching a level where interactions between classical and quantum computations can happen in real-time. This marks the advent of a new, broader class of quantum circuits: dynamic quantum circuits. They offer a broader range of available computing primitives that lead to new challenges for design tasks such as simulation, compilation, and verification. Due to the non-unitary nature of dynamic circuit primitives, existing techniques for these tasks are no longer applicable in an out-of-the-box fashion. In this work, we discuss the resulting consequences for quantum circuit verification and present first ideas for corresponding automatic methods. More precisely, we propose two different schemes that eventually allow to treat the involved circuits as if they were not dynamic at all. By this, we provide a basis for applying existing techniques for quantum circuit verification to this broader class of circuits.
