We propose a reliable scheme to recover the photon blockade effect in the dispersive-JaynesCummings model, which describes a two-level atom coupled to a single-mode cavity field in the largedetuning regime. This is achieved by introducing a transversal driving to the atom and then photonic nonlinearity is obtained. The eigen-energy spectrum of the system is obtained analytically, and the photon blockade effect is confirmed by numerically calculating the photon-number distributions and the equal-time second-order correlation function of the cavity field in the presence of system dissipations. We find that the photon blockade effect can be recovered at proper atomic and cavityfield drivings. This work will provide a new method to generate photon blockade in the dispersively coupled quantum optical systems.

I. INTRODUCTION
The photon blockade (PB) effect [1], as one of the physical methods for generation of single photons, has received considerable research interest in the recent two decades. Depending on the underlying physical mechanisms, conventional [1] and unconventional PBs [2, 3] have been proposed. Physically, the conventional PB effect is induced by the anharmonicity in the eigenenergy spectrum of the physical systems, while the unconventional PB effect is created by the quantum interference effect between different transition paths existed in the physical systems.
By far, the conventional PB effect has been studied in various nonlinear quantum optical systems, such as cavity quantum electrodynamical (QED) systems [4­ 14] and circuit-QED systems [15], which describe the interaction between fields and atoms. In addition, the conventional PB effect has been studied in various nonlinear bosonic-mode systems, such as Kerrtype nonlinear cavities [16­20], cavity optomechanical systems [21­28], coupled nonlinear cavities [29­31], and coupled waveguide systems [32, 33]. In particular, the conventional PB effect has been demonstrated in coupled atom-field systems, including a single two-level atom coupled to an optical cavity [34, 35], a quantum dot coupled to a photonic crystal cavity [36, 37], and a single superconducting artificial atom coupled to a transmission line resonator [38, 39]. In parallel, the unconventional PB effect has been studied theoretically [2, 3, 40­53] and experimentally [54, 55] in various coupled quantum optical systems.
As a typical quantum optical system, the coupled atom-cavity-field system has been demonstrated to show

the conventional PB effect under proper parameter conditions [56]. In particular, both the resonant and offresonant couplings have been studied and the optimal drivings have been found in these cases. It has been found that the conventional PB effect disappears in the largedetuning case, in which the optical nonlinearity vanishes. To recover the PB effect in the large-detuning regime of the coupled atom-cavity system, in this paper we propose an experimentally accessible method to recover the photonic nonlinearity in the system via introducing a transversal driving to the two-level atom. We obtain the analytical energy spectrum of the model, which gives the analytical result of the optimal driving frequency of the cavity field. We also get the steady state of the system by numerically solving the quantum master equation in the open-system case. Based on the steady state, we further calculate the photon number distributions and the equal-time second-order correlation functions of the cavity field. The results indicate that PB effect can be recovered under proper atomic and cavity-field drivings. We also evaluate the validity of the driven dispersive Jaynes-Cummings model by presenting the detailed derivation of the effective Hamiltonian and checking the fidelity between the exact and approximate states, which are governed by the effective Hamiltonian and the approximate Hamiltonian, respectively. This work will provide an experimentally implementable method to the observation of PB effect in dispersively coupled atomfield systems.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the physical model and present the Hamiltonian. In Sec. III, we investigate the PB effect by calculating the photon-number distributions and the equal-time second-order correlation function of the cavity field with the method of quantum master equation. In Sec. IV, we present some discussions on the detailed derivation of the effective Hamiltonian. We also evaluate the validity of the approximate Hamiltonian by calculating the fidelity between the exact and

II. MODEL AND HAMILTONIAN

We consider a driven dispersive Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model consisting of a single-mode cavity field and a two-level atom, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Here, the cavity field is coupled to the atom via a dispersive-JC type interaction, and a monochromatic field is applied to transversally drive the atom. The Hamiltonian of the driven dispersive-JC model reads ( = 1) [57]

where a (a) is the annihilation (creation) operator of the single-mode cavity field with resonance frequency c. The operators z = +- - -+ and x = + + - are, respectively, the Pauli operators of z and x directions for the two-level atom with the bare transition frequency 0 and the energy shift . Here, + = |e g| (- = |g e|) is the raising (lowering) operator defined based on the ground state |g and excited state |e of the atom. The third term in Eq. (1) describes the dispersive JC-

type interaction between the cavity mode and the atom with the coupling strength . The last term in Eq. (1) denotes a monochromatic driving to the atom, with R/2 and d being the driving strength and driving frequency, respectively. Note that the present driven dispersive-JC model has recently been implemented in a circuit-QED system, in which a superconducting resonator is coupled dispersively to a superconducting transmon qubit [57].
In a rotating frame with respect to d(aa + z/2), the Hamiltonian HddJC becomes

with c = c - d and 0 = 0 +  - d = 0 + , where c (0 = 0 - d) is the driving detuning of the cavity-field resonance (atomic bare transition) frequency
c (0) with respect to the atomic driving frequency d. In the following, we consider the case in which the
cavity field is coherently driven by a monochromatic field
with driving frequency L and driving strength . In this case, the total Hamiltonian of the whole system in the
Schr¨odinger picture can be expressed as Htot = HddJC + (ae-iLt + aeiLt). In a rotating frame defined by the unitary operator exp[-idt(aa + z/2) - iLtaa], the Hamiltonian Htot becomes

where c = c -L is the difference between the driving detuning c and the cavity driving frequency L.
To analyze the PB effect in this system, we need
to know the eigensystem of the driven dispersive-JC Hamiltonian Hd(Id)JC, which takes a time-independent form in the rotating frame. The eigensystem of the Hamiltonian Hd(Id)JC can be written as

Hd(Id)JC|m,± = Em,±|m,± ,

(4)

where the eigenvalues are

1 Em,± = mc ± 2

(0 + 2m)2 + 2R,

(5)

and the corresponding eigenstates are |m,± = |m a| ± (m) . Here |m a (m = 0, 1, 2, · · · ) are the photon number states, and the photon-number-dependent atomic states
| ± (m) are given by

| + (m) = cos m|e + sin m|g ,

(6a)

| - (m) = - sin m|e + cos m|g ,

(6b)

where the mixing angle m is defined by tan(2m) = R/(0 + 2m).
It can be seen from Eq. (5) that the energy spectrum of the system is a nonlinear function of the photon number m. This nonlinearity in the eigen-energy spectrum is the physical origin of PB effect in this system. However, the anharmonicity will become weak in both the weak- and

strong-driving cases. This point can be seen from the fact
that the eigenvalues are reduced to Em,±  mc ±(0 + 2m)/2 and Em,±  mc ± R/2 in the cases of R 0 + 2m and R 0 + 2m, respectively. In these two cases, the energy spectrum of the photonic part is
approximately harmonic. In Fig. 1(b), we schematically
show the eigenenergies Em,± of the system in the fewphoton subspaces (m = 0, 1, 2). It can be seen that the
energy spectrum of the driven dispersive-JC model in
the rotating frame is anharmonic, which motivates us to
study the PB effect in this system.

III. PHOTON BLOCKADE

In this section, we study the PB effect in this system by numerically calculating the photon number distributions and the equal-time second-order correlation function of the cavity-field mode. In particular, we obtain the steady state of the system and the field statistics by numerically solving the quantum master equation in the open-system case.
In a realistic situation, the physical system will inevitably interact with its environments. In this work, we assume that the cavity field and the two-level atom are connected with two individual vacuum baths, then the dynamics of the system is governed by the quantum master equation

 = i[, HI ] + Da[] + D[],

(7)

where  is the density matrix of the system, and the Lindblad superoperators are given by [58]

Da[]

=

(8a)



D[] = 2 (2-+ - +- - +-),

(8b)

with  () being the decay rate of the cavity-field

mode (atom). By numerically solving Eq. (7), the

steady-state density operator ss of the system can be obtained [59, 60]. Then the photon-number distributions

Pn = Tr[|n a a n|ss] and the equal-time second-order correlation function g(2)(0) = Tr(a2a2ss)/[Tr(aass)]2
can be obtained accordingly.

To study the statistical properties of the cavity filed,

we plot the photon-number distributions Pn=0,1,2 as functions of the driving detuning c/ in Fig. 2(a). We can see that the photon-number distributions satisfy

P0  1 and P0

P1

P2 in the weak-driving

case. In addition, it can be seen that there are some

peaks in the curves of P1 and P2. By analyzing the energy spectrum of the system [see Fig. 1(b)], we

find that the locations of the four peaks dn=1,2,3,4 in
P1 correspond to the single-photon resonant transitions
|0,+  |1,± and |0,-  |1,± , corresponding to c = 10,,±+ = [ (0 + 2)2 + 2R + 20 + 2R]/2 and c = 10,,±- = [ (0 + 2)2 + 2R - 20 + 2R]/2, respectively. Moreover, the locations of the four main

peaks pn=1,2,3,4 in P2 correspond to the two-photon
resonant transitions |0,+  |2,± and |0,-  |2,± , corresponding to c = 20,,±+ = [ (0 + 4)2 + 2R +
20 + 2R]/4 and c = 20,,±- = [ (0 + 4)2 + 2R-
20 + 2R]/4, respectively. The other two peaks in P2 are induced by the single-photon resonant transitions.

Usually, the PB effect will sensitively depend on the

frequency of the cavity-field driving. This is because

this frequency determines the resonance of the single-

photon physical transitions. To find the optimal driving

frequency of the PB effect, in Fig. 2(b) we plot the

equal-time second-order correlation function g(2)(0) as a

function of the driving detuning c/. It can be observed
that the locations of these dips dn and peaks pn in the curve of g(2)(0) correspond to the single- and two-photon

resonant transitions, respectively. Particularly, we find

that the optimal PB effect (the correlation function

g(2)(0)

1) takes place at single-photon resonant

transitions c = 10,,±+ and c = 01,,-± (the location of dn).

As analyzed in Sec. II, the photonic nonlinearity

will disappear in the weak and strong atomic driving

cases. Therefore, it is an interesting topic to study

the influence of the atomic driving strength on the PB

effect. In Fig. 3, the equal-time second-order correlation

function g(2)(0) is plotted as a function of the atomic

driving strength R/ at different single-photon resonant transitions c = 10,,±+ and c = 10,,±-. Here, the blue

curves correspond to the dispersive coupling strength / = 5, 10, and 15, respectively. We can see that the envelop of the correlation functions is lower for a larger value of the coupling strength /. This means that the PB effect is stronger for a larger dispersive-JC coupling strength. In addition, for a given , as the atomic driving strength R/ increases, the values of the correlation functions first decrease and then increase. This indicates that there is an optimal transversal driving strength of the atom. Physically, around the optimal atomic driving, the photon nonlinearity in the eigen-energy spectrum is strong. Here, we can see that the optimal value of R/ is around 2. This is because the photonic nonlinearity becomes important when d is almost large as m, where the contributing m is 1 in the photon blockade regime. In the weak- and strong-atom-driving cases, the PB effect disappears gradually. As shown in Fig. 3, the correlation function g(2)(0) approaches to 1 in the limit cases R/  0 and R/ 2m. This result matches the analyses concerning the energy spectrum of the system in Sec. II.
We also analyze the dependence of the PB effect on the dispersive JC coupling strength . In Fig. 4, we plot the equal-time second-order correlation function g(2)(0) as a function of the dispersive JC coupling strength / at different single-photon resonant transitions c = 10,,±+ and c = 10,,±-. Here, the blue dashed curves, green solid curves, and red dash-dotted curves correspond to the atomic driving strength R/ = 1, 2, and 5, respectively. It can be seen that the values of the correlation functions first increase and then decrease as the increase of /.

The reason is that the larger the coupling strength /, the stronger nonlinearity of the driven dispersiveJC model. In addition, it can be seen from Figs. 4(b) and 4(c) that the values of the correlation functions at the atomic driving strength R/ = 5 is larger than that at R/ = 2 in the cases of c = 10,,++ and c = 10,,--. This feature is a consequence of the non-monotonicity of the dependence of the correlation function g(2)(0) on the driving strength R.
IV. DISCUSSIONS ON THE VALIDITY OF HAMILTONIAN (1)
In this section, we present some discussions on the validity of the driven dispersive-JC Hamiltonian (2). Concretely, we will present a detailed derivation of the effective Hamiltonian of the driven JC system working in the large-detuning regime. We also analyze the difference between the derived effective Hamiltonian and the driven dispersive-JC Hamiltonian (2) by calculating the fidelity between the states governed by the derived Hamiltonian and Hamiltonian (2).
A. Derivation of the driven dispersive-JC Hamiltonian
Here, we present a detailed derivation of the driven dispersive-JC Hamiltonian based on the driven JC model, in which the atom is largely-detuned coupled with the cavity field, and the atom is driven by a monochromatic

where g is the coupling strength between the cavity field
and the atom, the operators and other parameters have
been defined in Eq. (1). In a rotating frame with respect to d(aa + z/2), the
Hamiltonian HdJC can be expressed as

where 0 = 0 - d and c = c - d have been introduced in Eq. (2). In the large-detuning case || = |0 - c| g n + 1 with n being the maximally dominated photon number involved in the

cavity field, the Hamiltonian of the driven dispersive-JC

model can be obtained by using the Fr¨ohlich-Nakajima

transformation [61, 62]. To this end, we introduce an

anti-Hermite operator S, which is determined by the

equation HI + [H0, S] = 0. Then the anti-Hermite operator S can be derived as

where we discarded the constant term /2. The last term in Eq. (14) can be regarded as a conditional cavity-field driving term depending on the states of the two-level atom. Under the parameter condition of Rg/(2||) |c + |, the last term in Eq. (14) can be approximately neglected, then the effective Hamiltonian (14) is reduced to the driven dispersive-JC Hamiltonian given by Eq. (2).

B. Evaluation of the validity of the driven dispersive-JC model

To quantitatively evaluate the validity of the driven dispersive-JC Hamiltonian (2), we check the fidelity F (t) = | (t)|(t) |2 between the state |(t) governed by the effective Hamiltonian (14) and the state |(t) governed by the dispersive-JC Hamiltonian (2). Below, we derive the expression of the two states by solving the equations of motion for these probability amplitudes in the two cases.
Corresponding to the effective Hamiltonian (14), the state of this system at time t is denoted as

|(t) = [An(t)|e, n + Bn(t)|g, n ], (15)
n=0
where An(t) and Bn(t) are the probability amplitudes. According to the Schr¨odinger equation, the equations of motion for these amplitudes are obtained as

For the dispersive-JC Hamiltonian (2), we assume that the state of the system takes the form as


|(t) = [an(t)|e, n + bn(t)|g, n ], (17)
n=0

with the probability amplitudes an(t) and bn(t). The evolution of these probability amplitudes is determined by these equations

By solving Eqs. (16) and (18) under a given initial state, we can obtain the states |(t) and |(t) accordingly. Then the fidelity can be obtained as

Note that in a realistic calculation, we need to truncate the dimension of the Hilbert space of the cavity field upto a finite number, which is determined by the photon number distribution in the cavity under a given initial state.

dispersively coupled atom-field system, in which the PB effect has been shown to be vanished in the dispersive parameter regime. This is realized by introducing a transversal driving to the atom, and this model has been experimentally implemented by superconducting quantum circuits [57]. In the absence of the cavity-field driving, we have obtained the analytical eigenvalues and eigenstates of the driven dispersive-JC model. We have also studied the PB effect by numerically calculating the photon-number distributions and the equal-time secondorder correlation function of the cavity field. It was found that PB effect can be observed in the single-photon resonant driving case. The influence of the system dissipations on the PB effect has been investigated by solving the quantum master equation. This work will open a route to observe PB effect in the dispersivelycoupled atom-cavity-field systems.

To confirm the parameter conditions of the driven dispersive JC model, in Fig. 5 we plot the fidelity F (t) as a function of the evolution time t at different values of g/. Here, we choosethe initial state of the system as |(0) = | (|g + |e )/ 2 with | being the coherent state ( = 1). It can be seen that the fidelity is high for a large ratio of ||/g. It means that, in the large-detuning regime, the present physical system can be well described by the driven dispersive JC model.
V. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we have proposed an experimentally realizable method to recover the PB effect in a
