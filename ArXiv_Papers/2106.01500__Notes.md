## Abstract

In this paper we study elimination of imaginaries in some classes of pure ordered abelian groups. For the class of ordered abelian groups with bounded regular rank (equivalently with finite spines) we obtain weak elimination of imaginaries once we add sorts for the quotient groups $\Gamma/ \Delta$ for each definable convex subgroup $\Delta$, and sorts for the quotient groups $\Gamma/ \Delta+ l\Gamma$ where $\Delta$ is a definable convex subgroup and $l \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2}$. We refer to these sorts as the \emph{quotient sorts}. For the dp-minimal case we obtain a complete elimination of imaginaries, if we also add constants to distinguish the cosets of $\Delta+n\Gamma$ in $\Gamma$, where $\Delta$ is a definable convex subgroup and $n \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2}$.
