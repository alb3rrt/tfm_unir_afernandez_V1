A SEPARATION LEMMA ON SUB-LATTICES
W.-M. WANG
Abstract. We prove that Bourgain's separation lemma, Lemma 20.14 [B2] holds at fixed frequencies and their neighborhoods, on sub-lattices, sub-modules of the dual lattice associated with a quasi-periodic Fourier series in two dimensions. And by extension holds on the affine spaces. Previously Bourgain's lemma was not deterministic, and is valid only for a set of frequencies of positive measure. The new separation lemma generalizes classical lattice partition-type results to the hyperbolic Lorentzian setting, with signature (1, -1, -1), and could be of independent interest.
Combined with the method in [W2], this should lead to the existence of quasi-periodic solutions to the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation with the usual polynomial nonlinear term up+1.

1. Introduction and the new separation lemma

We consider the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NLKG) on the d-torus Td = [0, 2)d:

(1.1)

2u t2

u

+

u

+

up+1

=

0,

where  is the Laplacian:

u

=

d i=1

 

2u x2i

;

p  N and is arbitrary; considered as a function on Rd, u is periodic, satisfying u(·, x) = u(·, x+2j), for all j  Zd. We are interested in solutions which depend

quasi-periodically, "periodic" with several frequencies on time in the form of a

(convergent) series:

(1.2)

u(t, x) =

a(n, j)ei(n·t+j·x),

(n,j )Zb ×Zd

where b corresponds to the number of base frequencies in time, · is the usual scalar product, and   Rb is the frequency. It is convenient to think of u as defined on the torus Tb ×Td. Series of the form (1.2) is closed under multiplication. So up+1 is also of this form.

Below we write Zb+d for Zb ×Zd, seen as the dual lattice to Tb ×Td. To simplify language, we will often say that Zb+d is the lattice, or module. Our goal In this
paper is to derive geometric properties of (1.2) under the action of the linear
operator:

(1.3)

L

:=

2 t2

1.

The linear operator L is separable. Define the wave operator D:



(1.4)

D := - + 1.

Its spectrum:

(D) = { |j|2 + 1 | j  Zd},

by using the Fourier series in (1.2) and setting t = 0. In d  2, the spectrum is
degenerate, and the spacing of non-equal eigenvalues tends to zero.
Operating on the full quasi-periodic Fourier series (1.2), L leads to a diagonal matrix P on Zb+d with matrix elements:

(1.5) P (n, j) := P ((n, j), (n, j)) = (n · )2 - j2 - 1, (n, j)  Zb+d,

where for simplicity, j2 stands for |j|2. The set of (n, j) such that |P (n, j)| < 1 plays an essential role in solving (1.1). In particular, since P = 0 solves the linear equation:

(1.6)

2u t2

u

u

=

0,

we shall start from the linear solutions. Denote linear solutions by u(0), and let

(1.7)

b



u(0)(t, x) =

akei(-( , jk2+1)t+jk·x)

k=1

where jk  Zd\{0}, k = 1, 2, ..., b, be such a solution. We may write u(0) in the form (1.2):

b



u(0)(t, x) =

akei(-( jk2+1)t+jk·x)

k=1

b

:=

a(-ek, jk)ei(-ek·(0)t+jk·x),

k=1

where ek, k = 1, 2, ..., b, are the canonical basis of Zb,

a(-ek, jk) = ak,

and (0) := { jk2 + 1}bk=1, (jk = 0).

3

We are interested in small solutions to (1.1). It is convenient to add ,   1

to the nonlinear term and write the NLKG as

(1.8)

2u t2

-

u

+

u

+

up+1

=

0.

We seek u close to u(0). From the structure of the equations (1.7) and (1.8), the sub-lattice U  Zb+d, generated by the set {(-ek, jk)}bk=1 plays a special role. We call it the sub-module generated by u(0). Writing the left side of (1.8) as
F (u), this is also in view of the (functional) derivative:

F (u)

=

2 t2

-



+

1

+

(p

+

1)up,

which plays a central role in the nonlinear analysis, cf. [W2][W1].

Remark. In the process of solving (1.8), (0) is replaced by , which is continuously being modulated, but it does not change the dual lattice Zb+d, nor the sub-lattice, sub-module U  Zb+d.

Lemma 1.1. On the sub-module, sub-lattice U  Zb+d, generated by the set {(-ek, jk)}bk=1, if (, )  U , and  = 0, then  = 0.

Proof. This follows from the property of the generating set: {(-ek, jk)}bk=1. Let
b
 = Ckek.
k=1
If  = 0, then Ck = 0 for k = 1, 2, ..., b. So
b
 = - Ckjk = 0.
k=1

Remark. The converse is generally not true, since in general, b > d.

1.1. The new separation lemma. Denote by k the set of primes (= 1) that occur in odd powers in the prime decomposition of jk2 + 1, jk = 0, k = 1, 2, ..., b. Assume that

(*) k = , k = 1, 2, ..., b, and there exist pk  k, k = 1, 2, ..., b, such that
pk = pk, for all k = k, k, k = 1, 2, ..., b. Let S be the set of j1, j2, ..., jb  Zd such that (*) is satisfied, and S the set
of j1, j2, ..., jb  Zd used in [W2], i.e., such that

1 < j12 + 1 < j22 + 1 < · · · . < jb2 + 1,

and square-free, then we have

S  S.

W.-M. WANG

Recall that S has positive density from [LX], so S has (at least) positive density as well.
Our main result is the following:

New Separation Lemma. Let d = 2, and

b



u(0)(t, x) =

akei(-( , jk2+1)t+jk·x)

k=1

be a solution to the linear equation (1.6). Assume that (*) is satisfied. Let   (0, 1] and B > 1 be an integer. Set

 = (0) +   Rb,

with ||  1. There exists a set A, 0  A, in , whose complement is of
measure less than , such that on A, the following holds: Let   R, and set x := (n, h)  Zb+2. Let U  Zb+2 be the sub-module
generated by u(0). Consider a sequence, a subset {xk}k=0  U  Zb+2, satisfying

(1.9)

|xi - xi-1| < B, 1  i  .

Assume that for all i, 1  i  ,

(1.10)

|(ni ·  + )2 - h2i - 1| < 1,

and that there exists B > 1, such that

(1.11)

maxmZ2 |{k|hk = m; 0  k  }| < B.

There exists B0 > 0, such that if B > B0, then there exists C > 1, and

(1.12)

 < (BB)C,

for all fixed .

We note that the lemma holds at  = (0), and the separation property is stable near (0). This refines Bourgain's separation lemma, Lemma 20.14 [B2], which uses  as parameters, in two dimensions. The new Lemma generalizes the
classical lattice partition-type results to the hyperbolic Lorentzian setting with signature (1, -1, -1), at irrational square root frequencies, and is essential to the proof of quasi-periodic solutions to (1.1).

Corollary. The New Separation Lemma holds on the affine spaces  + U of the module Zb+2, for all   Zb+2, i.e., the conclusion of the Lemma holds with +U replacing U, for all .
This is because the proof of the Lemma relies only on the differences xi - xi-1, i = 1, 2, ..., .

5
1.2. The role of separation lemmas. We note that the New Separation Lemma is asymptotic, it is applicable for large B. (This is also the case for Lemma 20.14 [B2].) Chap. 20 [B2] deals with parameter dependent wave equations, and asymptotic properties are sufficient for a proof of quasi-periodic solutions. (This is also the case in Chap. 19, for the parameter dependent nonlinear Schro¨dinger equations (NLS).)
For a fixed equation, such as (1.1), however, this is not enough, we need precise, non-asymptotic separation properties as well. This is provided by Lemma 5.2 [W2], which is a separation lemma at small scales, valid in arbitrary dimensions d. (Cf. the reformulation of Lemma 5.2 in sect. 2.3.) The lack of a separation lemma at large scales was the only reason why in [W2] we were not able to deal with polynomial nonlinearity.
We expect that the combination of the New Separation Lemma with Lemma 5.2 [W2] will now lead to a proof of quasi-periodic solutions to the NLKG in (1.1). (Remark that this approach is analogous to that used in [W1] for the fixed NLS.)
Note that quasi-periodic solutions to NLS are known from the works [W1][PP], cf. also the earlier related works [B1][B2][EK], but the corresponding problem for NLKG in higher dimensions is significantly more difficult due to the shrinking gaps and the degenerate spectra. In particular, number theory seeps into the arguments.
The New Lemma proves a separation property on a hyperbolic Lorentzian lattice of signature (1, -1, -1). Since most of the lattice partition-type results are in the elliptic (parabolic) setting, we believe the Lemma is of independent interest, aside from its applications to the NLKG in (1.1). So we present it separately. This is also because it seems to be a good occasion to elucidate some of the algebraic and geometric structures underlying the approach developed in [W1][W2]. (See also the review paper [W3].)
This paper is self-contained, the proofs are mostly algebraic and elementary, and can be read independently, without prior knowledge of NLKG.
1.3. Ideas of the proof. As mentioned above, most of the lattice partition-type results are on Euclidean lattice, for example, the separated cluster structure of the (n1, n2, ..., nd)  Zd on the hypersphere:
n21 + n22 + ... + n2d = R.
The positive definite signature (1, 1, ..., 1) played a key role. Lorentzian lattice deprives us of positivity, however, in its place, one may try
to impose certain non-zero conditions on quadratic forms. Given   Rb, for  = (, )  Zb+d, define the operators T± from Rb+d  R1+d to be:
T± = T±(, ) = ( · , ±).

6

W.-M. WANG

Note that
T+T- = ( · )2 - 2,
and is of a form similar to the left side in (1.10). In d = 2, for example, given two vectors 0 =  =   Zb+2, dim{, } = 2,
one may define the following 2 × 2 matrix:

T+- =

T+T- T+T-

T+T- T+T-

.

Assume  or  = 0, Lemma 20.23 [B2] proves that | det T+-| has a lower bound on a large set of   (0, 1]b. Similarly for the 1 × 1 determinants, when dim{, } = 1. More generally, Lemma 20.23 [B2] proves lower bounds on the absolute values of all such determinants, on a large set of   (0, 1]b, in arbitrary
dimensions d.
One may view T+- as an analogue of a Gram matrix in the Lorentzian setting. The lower bounds permit proof of the separation lemma, Lemma 20.14 [B2].

1.4. The new idea for fixed frequencies and their neighborhoods. The proof of the New Separation Lemma hinges on proving lower bounds on | det T+-|. The obvious difficulty is that, unlike in Lemma 20.23 [B2],  = (0) is fixed, and will not budge. However, we observe that det T+- is of the form
D := det T+- = a + bkkkk,
k<k
where a, bkk  Z. (There is no quartic in  term due to the wedge product.) So assume (*) holds, D = 0, if and only if a = bkk = 0, for all pairs, k and k (k < k). For example, when k, k  {1, 2}, this leads to two equations; and when k, k  {1, 2, 3}, 4 equations. In two dimensions, this suffices to make variable reductions to reach a contradiction on the sub-module U using Lemma 1.1. So D = 0. The result in [Schm] on simultaneous Diophantine approximations then gives the desired lower bound. Subsequently a simple argument gives also a lower bound in the neighborhood of (0), cf. the linear case in Lemma 5.3 [W2].
In three dimensions and above, the above strategy to prove D = 0 meets a difficulty, namely there are more unknowns than equations when the  have small support. For example, when d = 3, for  with less than 6 non-zero components. For  with larger support, the same proof works. Similarly for d > 3.

We prove the new separation lemma in the next section, and conclude by translating the separation lemma at small scales, Lemma 5.2 [W2] into the present language.

2. Proof of the new separation lemma

Given   Rb, for  = (, )  Zb+d, define the operators T± from Rb+d  R1+d as mentioned before:

(2.1)

T± = T±(, ) = ( · , ±).

Let k(0) = jk2 + 1, for k = 1, 2, ..., b, and assume (*) is satisfied. Below we specialize to d = 2.

2.1. Non-zero generalized Gram determinants at  = (0).

Lemma 2.1. For 0 =  = (, )  U  Zb+2, when  = (0),

(2.2)

T+T+ = ( · )2 + 2 = 0;

and

(2.3)

T+T- = ( · )2 - 2 = 0.

Proof. Eq. (2.2) clearly holds for non-zero  when  = 0, and when  = 0, using  = 0 and the rational independence of k, k = 1, 2, ..., b. Set
D = T+T-.
If  has two or more non-zero components, D contains one or more irrational terms using (*). The rational independence of 1, kk, k < k, k, k = 1, 2, ..., b, gives
D = 0.
If  has only one non-zero component, (without loss) say 1, then on the submodule  = 1j1. So
D = 1212 - 12j12 = 12 = 0.

We proceed to the 2 × 2 matrices.

Lemma 2.2. Assume  = (, ),  = (, )  Zb+2, dim {, } = 2, and dim {, } = 1. When  = (0), the 2 × 2 matrices:

(2.4) and (2.5)

T++ =

T+T+ T+T+

T+T+ T+T+

,

T+- =

T+T- T+T-

T+T- T+T-

,

satisfy

(2.6) and

det T++ = 0,

(2.7)

det T+- = 0.

8

W.-M. WANG

Proof. If  or  = 0, without loss, one may assume  = 0, then since  = 0,

det T++ = 2( · )2 = 0,
using the rational independence of 1 and kk, k < k, k, k = 1, 2, ..., b. If  = 0 and  = 0, and
dim {( · , ), ( · , )} = 1,
then since dim {, } = 1,  = c, c = 0. So

 ·  = c · .

So  = c,
using the rational independence of 1, and k, k = 1, 2, ..., b. This contradicts dim {, } = 2, so
det T++ = 0.
We now prove (2.7). If  or  = 0, then the same argument as for T++ shows

det T+- = 0.
If  = 0 and  = 0, then  = c, c = 0. Using this to compute the determinant, we obtain
det T+- = -2[c( · ) - ( · )]2. So det T+- = 0 if and only if  = c. So
(, ) = c(, ),

contradicting So (2.7) holds.

dim {(, ), (, )} = 2.

Remark. Note that the above lemma holds on Zb+2, and not just on the submodule U. In fact this lemma, with obvious modifications, i.e., the s span d dimensions; while the s (d - 1) dimensions, holds in any dimension d.
We now come to the crux of the matter, the lemma whose proof uses d = 2.

Main Lemma. Assume  = (, ),  = (, )  U  Zb+2, dim {, } = 2, and dim {, } = 2. When  = (0), the 2 × 2 matrices as defined in (2.4) and
(2.5) satisfy

(2.8)

det T++ = 0,

and

(2.9)

det T+- = 0.

9

Proof. Since dim {, } = 2, (2.8) is obviously true. We only need to prove (2.9).
Given   Zb, we call supp , the set in i, i = 1, 2, ..., b, such that i = 0. Without loss, there are two cases:
(A) supp   supp ; and
(B) supp   supp .

Case (A): Direct computation gives

(2.10) det T+- = -2( · )2 - 2( · )2 + 22 + 2( · )( · ) ·  - ( · )2.

If  ·  = 0, then clearly

( · )( · )

contains a square root term not in ( · )2 or ( · )2, so (2.9) holds. If  ·  = 0, |supp | or |supp |  2, without loss, assume |supp |  2, then ( · )2 contains a square root not in ( · )2, so (2.9) holds. Finally if |supp | = 1 and
|supp | = 1, then, without loss, one may assume

 = (1, 0, 0, .., 0), 1 = 0

and  = (0, 2 , 0, .., 0), 2 = 0.
Using this in (2.10) gives

det T+- = -122 2(j12j22 + j12 + j22) = 0.

We now proceed to case (B), it is further divided into three subcases: Case (B1): |supp | = 1.
In this case,  = c, so  = c by using Lemma 1.1, which contradicts dim {(, ), (, )} = 2. So (2.9) holds.
Case (B2): |supp | = 2. Without loss, one may write
 = (1, 2, 0, .., 0), 1 = 0, 2 = 0,
and  = (1 , 2 , 0, .., 0), 2 = 0.
We compute the terms that enter in the matrix T+-. Write
b
iji =  · j,
i=1
x = 1/2,

10

W.-M. WANG

and We have

y = 1 /2 .

(2.11) and

( · )2 - 2 = ( · )2 - ( · j)2 = 22(1 + x2 - 2xj1 · j2 + 2x12),

(2.12) ( · )( · ) - ( · j)( · j) = 22 [1 + xy - (x + y)j1 · j2 + (x + y)12].
Write A = j1 · j2,
and  = 12.
If det T+- = 0, then (2.13) (1+x2 -2Ax+2x)(1+y2 -2Ay +2y) = [1+xy -(x+y)A+(x+y)]2.

Equate the irrational part gives:

y(1 + x2 - 2Ax) + x(1 + y2 - 2Ay) = [1 + xy - (x + y)A](x + y),

which yields

A(x - y)2 = 0.

If A = 0, then x = y, i.e., 1/2 = 1 /2 . So  = c and  = c, using Lemma 1.1, which contradicts

dim {(, ), (, )} = 2.

If A = 0, equate the rational part of (2.13) gives:

(1 + x2 - 2Ax)(1 + y2 - 2Ay) + 4xy2 =(1 + x2)(1 + y2) + 4xy2 =[1 + xy - (x + y)A]2 + (x + y)22 =[1 + xy]2 + (x + y)22.

This leads to

(2 - 1)(x - y)2 = 0.

Since 2 = 1222 = (j12 + 1)(j22 + 1) > 1,
this gives again x = y, which is a contradiction. This concludes the proof of (2.9) for case (B2).

Case (B3): |supp |  3 We start from
(i) |supp | = 3

11

Without loss, one may write

 = (1, 2, 3, 0, .., 0), 1 = 0, 2 = 0, 3 = 0,

and Write

 = (1 , 2 , 3 , 0, .., 0), 3 = 0.

(2.14)

g=

 ·   ·   ·   · 

:=

g g g g

,

g is a positive definite Euclidean metric. Denote the inverse by g-1, which again is a positive definite Euclidean metric. Denote its matrix elements by

g , g, g and g .

Let D = - det T+-/ det g.
Then simple computation gives
D = g[1212 + 2222 + 3232 + 21212 + 22323 + 23131] +g[1 212 + 2 222 + 3 232 + 21 2 12 + 22 3 23 + 23 1 31] -2g[11 12 + 22 22 + 33 32 + (12 + 1 2)12 + (23 + 2 3)23 + (31 + 3 1)31] -1

If D = 0, the irrational part of the equation gives the following system of three equations:

(2.15)

 1

2g



+

1 2 g

-

(12

+

1 2)g

=

0,

23g + 2 3 g - (23 + 2 3)g = 0,

31g + 3 1 g - (31 + 3 1)g = 0.

(ia) g = 0 Viewing g, g, g as the variables x, y and z, say, then x = y = z = 0
is a solution. Denote the coefficient matrix of the system by V, then there are
non-zero solutions if and only if

det V = 0.

This leads to the existence of  and , (, ) = 0 such that

 12 = 23 + 31, 
1 2 = 2 3 + 3 1 , 12 + 1 2 = (23 + 2 3) + (31 + 3 1),
which leads to either

(2.16)

1/3 = 1 /3 ,

12

W.-M. WANG

or

(2.17)

2/3 = 2 /3 .

If 1 = 0 and 2 = 0, this is a contradiction; else substituting (2.16) in the third equation in (2.15) leads to

32g + 3 2g - 233 2g = (v, g-1v) = 0,
where v := (3, -3 ) = 0. Since g-1 is a positive definite metric, as mentioned earlier, below (2.14), this is a contradiction; or else substituting (2.17) in the second equation in (2.15) leads to the same contradiction with v := (2, -2 ) = 0. So
det T+- = 0.
(ib) g = 0 One may assume |supp | = |supp | = 3, otherwise clearly it is a contradic-
tion. Subsequently one deduces from (2.15) that

1 /1 = 2 /2 = 3 /3.

So  = c,

which yields

 = c

from Lemma 1.1, which contradicts

dim {, } = 2.

So again det T+- = 0.
(ii) |supp | > 3 Clearly without loss, one may again write

 = (1, 2, 3, 4, ..., b), 1 = 0, 2 = 0, 3 = 0, 4 = 0 ...

and
 = (1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ..., b ), 3 = 0.
The linear system obtained from the irrational part of the equation contains (2.15) as a sub-system. When g = 0, the same argument applies and leads to det T+- = 0. When g = 0, if |supp | < |supp |, it is a clear contradiction, otherwise it leads to

1 /1 = 2 /2 = 3 /3 = 4 /4 ..., and the same conclusion holds. This finishes the proof.

13

2.2. Proof of the New Separation Lemma.

Proof. We first prove lower bounds on det T++ and | det T+-| at , and that  is Diophantine. (i) The 2 × 2 case
We begin with T+-. We have
D : = det T+-
= -[( · )2 - ( · )]2 + 22 - ( · )2

= P ((0)) + P1(; (0)) + 2P2() : = P + P,

where P2 is a quadratic polynomial in  with integer coefficients and P1 linear, and |P| < B4. Further

2P2 k2

= -2

[k - k]

2,

k = 1, 2, ..., b.

So there exists k, such that

2P2 k2

=

0,

otherwise it contradicts with dim {(, ), ()} = 2 on the sub-module U, there-

for some k.

From Lemmas 2.1, 2.2 and the Main Lemma,

P = 0.

Assume |(, )| and |(, )|  N , N  [1, B]. The simultaneous Diophantine approximation result in [Schm] then gives that

Clearly

So for N such that

.

At scale N, the number of quadratic polynomials in  from D, are bounded

above by

(2.19)

[N 4](b+Cb2+b+1) < N 4b2 .

14

Set (2.20)

q = 4(2 + 4 + 2b2 + 1).

If

then

|D|

holds at all scales N , away from a set in  of measure less than 1+,  > 0, by

summing over N and using (2.18), (2.19) and (2.21). Similar arguments yields

the same bound for the T++.

(ii) The 1 × 1 case

D = ( · )2 - 2

= ( · (0))2 - 2 + 2( · (0))( · ) + 2( · )2.

Since  has at least one non-zero component, say 1, then

2D 12

=

2212



22.

So we obtain the bounds on det T++, and likewise det T+-, as in the 2 × 2 case.

(iii) Diophantine 

This follows the same line of arguments, and simpler. It is just Lemma 5.3 in

[W2].

Using (i-iii), we can now apply the proof of Lemma 20.14 [B2] to conclude.

2.3. About Lemma 5.2 [W2]. Finally we remark that for the initial scales, N  | log |s, s > 1, the separation lemma, Lemma 5.2 in [W2], (under the stated conditions there), maybe reformulated as saying that given   R, if xk = (nk, hk)  [-N, N ]b+d satisfies
(nk ·  + )2 - h2k - 1 = 0, for all k = 0, 1, 2, ..., ,
