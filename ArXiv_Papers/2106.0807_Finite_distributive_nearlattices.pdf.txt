FINITE DISTRIBUTIVE NEARLATTICES
LUCIANO J. GONZA´ LEZ AND ISMAEL CALOMINO
Abstract. Our main goal is to develop a representation for finite distributive nearlattices through certain ordered structures. This representation generalizes the well-known representation given by Birkhoff for finite distributive lattices through finite posets. We also study finite distributive nearlattices through the concepts of dual atoms, boolean elements, complemented elements and irreducible elements. We prove that the sets of boolean elements and complemented elements form semi-boolean algebras. We show that the set of boolean elements of a finite distributive lattice is a boolean lattice.
1. Introduction and preliminaries
It is well known that the class of distributive lattices have many and important applications, especially in logic and computer science. Thus, it is also important to study some natural generalizations of distributive lattices which may result interesting. An important class of distributive lattices for computer science is the class of finite distributive lattices. This paper deals with the concept of finite distributive nearlattice, which is a natural and nice generalization of finite distributive lattice.
Distributive nearlattices were study from different points of view: algebraic, topological and logical [15, 21, 14, 2, 7, 11, 19, 8, 12, 6, 9, 10, 17, 18].
In Section 2 we consider the notions of dual atom and boolean element. We prove that the boolean elements form a semi-boolean algebra ([1]). In Section 3 we show that the semi-boolean algebra of boolean elements of a finite distributive nearlattice A is a homomorphic image of A. We generalize the concept of complement elements from distributive lattice to distributive nearlattice and, we show that the set of complement elements of a distributive nearlattice is a semi-boolean algebra. Section 4 is concerned with the free distributive lattice extension of a distributive nearlattice ([11]). Finally, in Section 5 we develop a discrete representation for the class of finite distributive nearlattice, which is a generalization of the well-known representation for finite distributive lattice given by Birkhoff [4].
We assume that the reader is familiar with the theory of ordered sets and lattices. Our main references for Order and Lattice theory are [16, 20, 3]. Now we introduce the notational conventions that we use throughout the paper.
Let P = P,  be a poset. A subset U  P is said to be an upset when for all a, b  P , if a  b and a  U , then b  U . Dually we have the notion of downset. Given an element a  P , the principal upset generated by a is [a) := {x  P : a  x}. Dually we have the principal downset (a]. Given a subset Q of P and a  P , [a)Q := {x  Q : a  x}.

Definition 1.1 ([15]). A distributive nearlattice is a join-semilattice A = A, , 1 with top element 1 such that for all a  A, the principal upset [a) is a bounded distributive lattice (with respect to the induced order).
Let A = A, , 1 be a distributive nearlattice. For each a  A, we denote the meet in [a) by a. It should be noted that for all x, y  A, the meet x  y exists in A if and only if x, y have a common lower bound in A. Thus, for all x, y  [a), the meet of x, y in [a) coincides with their meet in A, that is, x a y = x  y. This should be kept in mind since we will use it without mention. A subset F  A is called filter if (i) 1  F ; (ii) F is an upset; and (iii) if a, b  F and a  b exists in A, then a  b  F . Let us denote by Fi(A) the collection of all filters of A. It is straightforward that Fi(A) is a closure system. For X  A, we denote by FigA(X) the filter generated by X. Thus, we have that Fi(A), , , {1}, A is a distributive lattice where F  G = FigA(F  G), for all F, G  Fi(A).
A non-empty subset I  A is said to be an ideal when (i) I is a downset; (ii) if a, b  I, then a  b  I. A proper ideal I of A is called prime when for all a, b  A, if a  b exists and a  b  I, then a  I or b  I.
Theorem 1.2 ([21]). Let A be a distributive nearlattice. If I is an ideal and F is a filter of A such that I  F = , then there exists a prime filter P of A such that I  P and P  F = .
Given two distributive nearlattices A1 and A2, a map f : A1  A2 is said to be an N-homomorphism if f (1) = 1; for all a, b  A1, f (a  b) = f (a)  f (b), and f (a  b) = f (a)  f (b), whenever a  b exists in A1.
The reader is referred to [13, 15, 5] for further information about distributive nearlattices.

2. Dual atoms and boolean elements
Definition 2.1. Let A be a distributive nearlattice and a  A. We will say that a is a dual atom if a = 1 and for each x  A, a  x  1 implies x = a or x = 1. We say that a is a boolean element if the principal filter [a) is a boolean lattice.
Let us denote by Atd(A) and Bo(A) the collections of all dual atoms of A and of all boolean elements of A, respectively. It follows that Atd(A)  Bo(A). If a  Bo(A) and x  [a), we shall denote the complement of x in [a) by ¬ax. The next properties will be used throughout the paper without mention.
Remark 2.2. Let a  Atd(A). Then, for all x  A, we have that x  a or xa = 1. Moreover, if A is a finite distributive nearlattice, then for every x < 1, there exists a  Atd(A) such that x  a.
Proposition 2.3. Let A be a distributive nearlattice. Let a1, . . . , an  Atd(A) be such that a1  · · ·  an exists in A. Then a1  · · ·  an  Bo(A).
Proof. Let a = a1  · · ·  an. Since [a), a , , a, 1 is a bounded distributive lattice, it only remains to verify that each element of [a) has a complement. For each ai, let us denote the complement of an element x  [ai) by ¬ix. That is, for every x  [ai), ¬ix  [ai) such that x ai ¬ix = ai and x  ¬ix = 1.
Let x  [a). Thus x = (a1  x)  · · ·  (an  x). We define the element ¬x := ¬1(a1  x)  · · ·  ¬n(an  x) (notice that the last meet exists because

a  ai  ¬i(ai  x), for all i). It is clear that ¬x  [a). Now we show that ¬x is the complement of x in [a). On the one hand, we have

¬x  x =

¬i(ai  x) 

(ai  x) =

[¬i(ai  x)  (ai  x)]

=

ai = a.

1in

On the other hand, we have





¬x  x = 

¬i(ai  x)  x =

(¬i(ai  x)  x) .

1in

1in

Since every ai is a dual atom, it follows that

¬i(ai  x) =

1 ai

if x  ai if x ai

Hence, in any case, we obtain that ¬i(ai  x)  x = 1. Then ¬x  x = 1. We have proved that ¬x is the complement of x in [a). Therefore, [a), a , , a, 1 is a boolean lattice, and thus a = a1  · · ·  an  Bo(A).

Let A be a distributive nearlattice and a  A. We define the following set:

Xa := {x  Atd(A) : a  x}.
Thus, Xa = Atd(A)  [a) = Atd([a)). If A is finite and a  Bo(A), then since [a) is a finite boolean lattice it follows that

a = Xa.

Lemma 2.4. Let A be a distributive nearlattice and a, b  A. Then Xab = Xa  Xb. If a  b exists, then Xab = Xa  Xb.

Proof. It is straightforward to show directly that Xab = Xa  Xb. It is clear that Xa Xb  Xab. Let now x  Xab. Since a b  x, we have that
x = (ax)(bx). Given that x  Atd(A), it follows that (a  x or ax = 1) and (b  x or b  x = 1). If a  x = 1 and b  x = 1, then x = 1, which is a contradiction.
Hence, a  x or b  x. That is, x  Xa  Xb. Therefore Xab  Xa  Xb.

Proposition 2.5. Let A = A, , 1 be a finite distributive nearlattice. Then Bo(A), , 1 is a nearlattice subalgebra of A.

Proof. We need to prove that Bo(A) is closed under , and if a, b  Bo(A) are such that a  b exists in A, then a  b  Bo(A).
Let a, b  Bo(A). Notice that a  b  Xab, and since a, b  Bo(A), it follows that a = Xa and b = Xb. By Proposition 2.3, we have Xab  Bo(A). Let us show that a  b = Xab. Suppose, towards a contradiction, that a  b = Xab. So Xab a  b. Then, there is a prime ideal P such that a  b  P and
Xab / P . Thus, a, b  P and P  Xab = . Since Xa  P , Xb  P and P is prime, it follows that there is xa  Xa such that xa  P and there is xb  Xb such that xb  P . Since xa and xb are dual atoms, we have

xa  xb =

1 xa = xb

if xa = xb if xa = xb

LUCIANO J. GONZA´ LEZ AND ISMAEL CALOMINO

Since P is proper and xa  xb  P , we have that xa = xb. Let x := xa = xb. Thus a  b  x. Then x  Xab  P , which is a contradiction. Hence a  b = Xab  Bo(A). Let now a, b  Bo(A) be such that a  b exists in A. By Lemma 2.4, we have
Xab = (Xa  Xb) = Xa  Xb = a  b.
Then, it follows by Proposition 2.3 that ab = Xab  Bo(A). Therefore, Bo(A) is a nearlattice subalgebra of A.

Proposition 2.6. Let A be a finite distributive nearlattice. Let a  Bo(A) and b  A. If a  b, then b  Bo(A). That is, [a)Bo(A) = [a)A.
Proof. Let a  Bo(A) and b  A be such that a  b. Since a is a boolean element, we have a = Xa. We also have that b  Xb. Suppose that Xb b. Then, there is a prime ideal P such that b  P and Xb / P . Thus, a  P and XbP = . Since Xa  P and P is prime, we obtain that there is x  Xa  P . Then, x / Xb. Since x  Atd(A) and b x, it follows that b  x = 1. This is a contradiction because b, x  P and P is a proper ideal. Hence b = Xb  Bo(A).

A semi-boolean algebra ([1]) is a join-semilattice with a top element such that every principal upset is a Boolean lattice. In [1] Abbot show that the semi-boolean algebras are in a one-to-one correspondence with the implication algebras (also known as Tarski algebras).

Theorem 2.7. Let A = A, , 1 be a finite distributive nearlattice. Then, the nearlattice subalgebra Bo(A), , 1 is a semi-boolean algebra.

Proof. Let a  Bo(A). By Proposition 2.6, we have [a)Bo(A) = [a)A, and since Bo(A) is a nearlattice subalgebra of A, it follows that [a)Bo(A) is a boolean lattice. Hence Bo(A) is a semi-boolean algebra.

Proposition 2.8. Let A be a finite distributive nearlattice. equivalent:
(1) Atd(A) exists in A; (2) There is a  A such that Bo(A) = [a); (3) Bo(A) is a boolean lattice.

The following are

Proof. (1)  (2) Let a := Atd(A). It follows by Proposition 2.3 that a  Bo(A). Let b  Bo(A). Then, a = Atd(A)  Xb = b. Thus b  [a). Hence Bo(A)  [a). Now, by Proposition 2.6, we have [a) = [a)Bo(A)  Bo(A). Therefore, Bo(A) = [a).
(2)  (3) It follows straightforward by Theorem 2.7.
(3)  (1) Let a  A be the least element of Bo(A). Thus [a) = [a)Bo(A) = Bo(A). Since Atd(A)  Bo(A) = [a), we obtain that Atd(A) exists in A.

Corollary 2.9. If L is a finite distributive lattice, then Bo(L) is a boolean lattice. Moreover, for each a  Bo(L) and x  [a), we have ¬ax = ¬xa, where ¬x denotes the complement of x in Bo(L).

Proof. From the previous proposition, it is clear that Bo(L) is a boolean lattice. Let a  Bo(L) and x  [a). Since [a) is a boolean lattice, there is unique ¬ax  [a) such that x  ¬ax = 1 and x  ¬ax = a. As a  x, by Proposition 2.6 we have x  Bo(L) and, there is ¬x  Bo(L) such that x  ¬x = 1 and x  ¬x = c, where c  A is the least element of Bo(L). Consider the element ¬x  a  [a). So,

(¬xa)x = (¬xx)a = 1a = 1 and (¬xa)x = (¬xx)(ax) = ca = a. Hence, we have ¬ax = ¬x  a.

3. Annihilators
Let A = A, , 1 be a distributive nearlattice. For every a  A, let a = {x  A : a  x = 1} (see [7, 14]). It follows that a  Fi(A), for all a  A. We will say that an element a  A is dense if a = {1}. Denote by D(A) the set of all dense elements of A.

Proposition 3.1. Let A be a finite distributive nearlattice. equivalent:
(1) Atd(A) exists in A; (2) There is a  A such that D(A) = (a]; (3) D(A) is not empty.

The following are

Proof. (1)  (2) Let a := Atd(A). Let x  a. So x  a = 1. Suppose that x < 1. Then, there is b  Atd(A) such that x  b. Thus b = b  a = 1, which is a contradiction. Hence x = 1. It follows that a = {1}, and thus a  D(A). We obtain that (a]  D(A). Let now b  D(A). So b = {1}. Let x  Atd(A). Since x / b, we have b  x = 1. Thus b  x. Then b  Atd(A) = a. Hence b  (a]. Therefore, D(A)  (a].
(2)  (3) It is immediate.
(3)  (1) Let us show that Atd(A) has a lower bound. As D(A) = , there is a  A such that a = {1}. Let x  Atd(A) and suppose that a x. Thus, xa = 1. Then x  a = {1}, which is a contradiction because x  Atd(A). Hence a  x, for all x  Atd(A). Therefore, Atd(A) exists in A.

Proposition 3.2. Let A be a finite distributive nearlattice. The following proper-
ties are satisfied:
(1) Let a, b  Bo(A). Then, a  b if and only if a  b. (2) For each a  A, we have a = ( Xa).
Proof. (1) It is easy to show that a  b implies a  b. Conversely, assume that a  b. Let x  Xb. Then x  Atd(A) and b  x = x = 1, i.e., x / b. So, x / a. Since a  x = 1 and x is dual atom, we have a  x. Thus x  Xa. Thus Xb  Xa. Therefore, a = Xa  Xb = b.
(2) Let a  A and b := Xa. By Proposition 2.3, b  Bo(A). Since a  b we have a  b. Let x  b. Thus,

1 = b  x = Xa  x = {y  x : y  Xa}.

Then y  x = 1, for all y  Xa. Suppose that a  x < 1. So, there exists y  Atd(A) such that a  x  y < 1. Thus a  y and x  y. It follows that y  Xa. Then y = y  x = 1, which is a contradiction. Hence, a  x = 1. Thus x  a. Then, we obtain that b  a. Therefore, a = b = ( Xa).
Given a finite distributive nearlattice A we define the map A : A  Bo(A) as follows: for every a  A,
A(a) = Xa.
From Proposition 2.3, it follows that A is well defined.

Remark 3.3. Notice that a  A(a), for all a  A. Moreover, for each a  A, A(a) is the least boolean element b such that a  b. Thus, we also have that A(a) = a, for all a  Bo(A).
Proposition 3.4. Let A be a finite distributive nearlattice. Then, the map A : A  Bo(A) is an onto N-homomorphism.

Proof. Let a, b  A. By definition and Lemma 2.4, we have A(a  b) = Xab = (Xa  Xb). Since Xa  Xb  Xa, Xb, it follows that A(a)  A(b)  A(a  b).
By Remark 3.3, we have a  A(a) and b  A(b). Thus a  b  A(a)  A(b). Then, since A(a)  A(b) is a boolean element, it follows by Remark 3.3 that A(a  b)  A(a)  A(b). Therefore, A(a  b) = A(a)  A(b).
Now assume that a  b exists in A. Then,

A(a  b) = Xab = (Xa  Xb) = Finally, A(1) = X1 =  = 1.

Xa 

Xb = A(a)  A(b).

It is well known that if L is a bounded distributive lattice, then the subset Comp(L) of all complemented elements of L form a boolean algebra. Given that in a distributive nearlattice may not exists the least element, we generalize the concept of complemented element as follows. Recall that  denotes the supremum in Fi(A) and a  Fi(A), for all a  A.

Definition 3.5. Let A be a distributive nearlattice. An element a  A is said to be complemented if [a)  a = A.

We denote by C(A) the set of all complemented elements of A.

Proposition 3.6. If A is a bounded distributive lattice, then Comp(A) = C(A).
Proof. Let a  C(A). So [a)  a = A. Let 0 be the least element of A. Since 0  [a)  a, there is b  a such that a  b = 0. Thus, we have a  b = 1 and a  b = 0. Then, b is the complement of a in A. Hence a  Comp(A).
Let now a  Comp(A). Let a  A be the complement of a. Thus a  a = 0 and a  a = 1. Let x  A. Then (a  x)  (a  x) = (a  a)  x = x. Since x  a  [a) and a  x  a, it follows that x  [a)  a. Hence [a)  a = A. Therefore, a  C(A).

Proposition 3.7. Let A = A, , 1 be a distributive nearlattice. Then C(A), , 1 is a nearlattice subalgebra of A.
Proof. Let a, b  C(A). Thus [a)  a = [b)  b = A. Then,
[a  b)  (a  b) = ([a)  [b))  (a  b) = [a)  (a  b)  [b)  (a  b) .
Since a  a  b, we have a  (a  b). Thus A = [a)  a  [a)  (a  b). Then A = [a)  (a  b). Analogously, we have A = [b)  (a  b). It follows [a  b)  (a  b) = A. Hence, a  b  C(A).
Assume now that a  b exists in A. Then, [a  b)  (a  b) = ([a)  [b))  a  b = [a)  [b)  a  [a)  [b)  b = A.
Hence a  b  C(A). Therefore, C(A), , 1 is a nearlattice subalgebra of A.

Proposition 3.8. Let A = A, , 1 be a distributive nearlattice. Then C(A), , 1 is a semi-boolean algebra.
Proof. By the previous proposition we know that C(A), , 1 is a distributive nearlattice. Thus, [a)C(A) is a bounded distributive lattice, for all a  C(A). Let a  C(A). Let us show that each element of the lattice [a)C(A) has a complement. Let b  [a)C(A). So a  b and b  C(A). Then [b)  b = A. Given that a  [b)  b, there exist x  [b) and y  b such that a = x  y. Thus a  y and y  b = 1. Notice that a  b, y. Then a  b  y. Since b  x, it follows that b  y  x  y = a. Hence a = b  y. Now we show that y  C(A). Since a = b  y, we obtain that [a) = [b)  [y) and a = b  y. Moreover, since b  y, it follows that [b)  y. Then, we have
A = [a)  a = ([b)  [y))  b  y = [b)  [y)  b  [b)  [y)  y
= [y)  y.
Hence, we obtain that y  [a)C(A), b  y = 1 and b  y = a. That is, y is the complement of b in [a)C(A). Then [a)C(A) is a boolean algebra. Therefore, C(A) is a semi-boolean algebra.
Proposition 3.9 ([6]). Let A be a distributive nearlattice. Then, A is a semiboolean algebra if and only if A = C(A).
Proposition 3.10. Let A be a finite distributive nearlattice. Then, A is a semiboolean algebra if and only if Bo(A) = C(A).
Proof. Assume that A is a semi-boolean algebra. Then, A = Bo(A) and A = C(A). Hence Bo(A) = C(A). Conversely, assume that Bo(A) = C(A). Let a  A. Then, by Proposition 3.2, a = b, where b = Xa. Thus, b  Bo(A) = C(A) and a  b. Then A = [b)  b  [a)  b = [a)  a. Thus a  C(A). Hence A = C(A). Therefore, A is a semi-boolean algebra.
4. Connection with the free distributive lattice extension
Definition 4.1. Let A be a distributive nearlattice. A pair L(A), e , where L(A) is a bounded distributive lattice and e : A  L(A) is an N-embedding, is said to be a free distributive lattice extension of A if e[A] is finitely meet-dense in L(A) and the following universal property holds: for every bounded distributive lattice M and every N-homomorphism h : A  M , there exists a unique lattice homomorphism h : L(A)  M such that h = h  e.
Lemma 4.2. Let A be a distributive nearlattice and let L(A), e be the free distributive lattice extension of A. The following properties are satisfied:
(1) e [[a)] = [e(a)). (2) FigL(A) e a = e(a).
Proof. (1) It is clear that e [[a)]  [e(a)). Conversely, if u  [e(a)), then e(a)  u. Since e[A] is finitely meet-dense in L(A), there exist x1, . . . , xn  A such that u = e(x1). . . e(xn). Then e(a)  e(xi), for all i  {1, . . . , n}. Since e is injective, we have a  xi, i  {1, . . . , n}. Then, there exists y := x1  . . .  xn  [a) such that e(y) = u. Hence u  e [[a)]. Therefore, e [[a)] = [e(a)).
(2) We know that e(a) is a filter of L(A), and it is clear that e a  e(a). Then, we have FigL(A) e a  e(a). Let now u  e(a). So u  e(a) = 1L(A).

LUCIANO J. GONZA´ LEZ AND ISMAEL CALOMINO

Let a1, . . . , an  A be such that u = e(a1)  · · ·  e(an). Thus 1L(A) = u  e(a) = (e(a1)  e(a))  · · ·  (e(an)  e(a)). Then 1L(A) = e(ai  a) for all i. Hence ai  a = 1 for all i. That is, a1, . . . , an  a. Thus, e(a1), . . . , e(an)  e a . Then u = e(a1)  · · ·  e(an)  FigL(A) e a . Hence, FigL(A) e a = e(a).
Proposition 4.3. Let A be a finite distributive nearlattice and L(A), e its free distributive nearlattice extension. Then,
(1) e [Atd(A)] = Atd(L(A)); (2) e [Bo(A)]  Bo(L(A)); (3) e [C(A)]  Comp(L(A)).

Proof. (1) Let a  Atd(A). Let u  L(A) be such that e(a)  u  1L(A) (recall that 1L(A) = e(1)). Thus, there are a1, . . . , an  A such that u = e(a1)  · · · e(an). Since e(a)  u  e(ai) for all i, we obtain that a  ai  1 for all i. Then, for
every i, a = ai or ai = 1. If ai = 1 for all i, then u = 1L(A). Otherwise, there is i  {1, . . . , n} such that ai = a. Thus, e(a)  u  e(ai) = e(a). Then u = e(a).
Hence e(a)  Atd(L(A)). Let now u  Atd(L(A)). There are a1, . . . , an  A such that u = e(a1)  · · ·  e(an). Since u = 1L(A), it follows that there is i, such that ai = 1. Then, since u  e(ai) < 1L(A), we have u = e(ai). Moreover, it is straightforward to show directly that ai  Atd(A). Hence u  e [Atd(A)].
(2) Let a  Bo(A). It is clear that [e(a)), , , e(a), 1L(A) is a bounded distributive sublattice of L(A). We need only to prove that every element of [e(a)) is com-
plemented. Recall that [e(a)) = e [[a)]. Thus, let e(x)  [e(a)) with x  [a). Since
[a) is a boolean lattice, there is ¬ax  [a) such that x  ¬ax = 1 and x a ¬ax = a. Then 1L(A) = e (x  ¬ax) = e(x)e (¬ax) and e(a) = e (x a ¬ax) = e(x)e (¬ax). Thus, e (¬ax) is the complement of e(x) in [e(a)), i.e., e (¬ax) = ¬e(a)e(x). Therefore, e(a)  Bo(L(A)).
(3) Let a  C(A). So [a)  a = A. We need to prove that e(a)  Comp(L(A)). From Proposition 3.6, it is equivalent to show that [e(a))  e(a) = L(A) (here  is the join of Fi(L(A))). Since [a)  a = A, it follows that

FigL(A) e [a)  a = FigL(A) (e[A]) = L(A).

By [11, Thm. 3.3], we know that the map  : Fi(A)  Fi(L(A)) defined by (F ) = FigL(A) (e[F ]) for every F  Fi(A), is a lattice isomorphism. Then,

FigL(A) e [a)  a

=  [a)  a =  ([a))   a = FigL(A) (e [[a)])  FigL(A) e a = [e(a))  FigL(A) e a .

Hence, by Lemma 4.2, we have

L(A) = FigL(A) e [a)  a = [e(a))  e(a).

Therefore, we have shown that e(a)  C(L(A)).

Remark 4.4. If A is a finite distributive nearlattice, then L(A) is a finite distributive lattice. Hence, by Corolary 2.9, it follows that Bo (L(A)) is a boolean lattice and for all a  Bo(A), e (¬ax) = ¬e(x)  e(a) for all x  [a).
Theorem 4.5. Let A be a finite distributive nearlattice and L(A), e its free distributive lattice extension. Then L(A)  e = e  A, i.e., the following diagram

= {e(x) : x  Atd(A), e(a)  e(x)}

= e {x  Atd(A) : a  x} = e (A(a)) .

5. A discrete representation
In this section we develop a representation for the class of finite distributive nearlattices through certain ordered structures. This representation is a nice generalization of that given by Birkhoff for finite distributive lattice through finite posets ([4]).
Definition 5.1. Let A be a distributive nearlattice. An element a  A is said to be meet-irreducible (or simply irreducible) if for all x, y  A such that x  y exists in A, a = x  y implies a = x or a = y.
Let us denote by Irr(A) the set of all irreducible elements of A. Notice that Atd(A)  Irr(A).
Proposition 5.2. Let A be a distributive nearlattice and a  A. Then, a is irreducible if and only if for all x, y  A such that x  y exists, x  y  a implies x  a or y  a.
Theorem 5.3. Let A be a finite distributive nearlattice. Then, for every a  A,
a = {x  Irr(A) : a  x}.

Proof. Let S = {a  A : a = {x  Irr(A) : a  x}}. We suppose by contradiction that S = . Then, since A is finite, S has a maximal element m. Thus m / Irr(A). Then, there exist a, b  A such that m = a  b, m < a and m < b. Since m is a maximal element of S, it follows that a, b / S. Thus a = {x  Irr(A) : a  x} and b = {Irr(A) : b  x}. Hence, by Proposition 5.2, we have
m = {x  Irr(A) : a  x}  {x  Irr(A) : b  x}

= {x  Irr(A) : m  x}.
Thus, we obtain that m / S, which is a contradiction. Therefore, S = .
Proposition 5.4. Let A be a finite distributive nearlattice and L(A), e its free distributive lattice extension. Then, e [Irr(A)] = Irr(L(A)).
Proof. Let x  Irr(A). Let u, v  L(A) be such that e(x) = u  v. There are a1, . . . , an, b1, . . . , bm  A such that u = e(a1)· · ·e(an) and v = e(b1)· · ·e(bm). Thus, we have that e(x)  e(ai), e(bj), for all i = 1, . . . , n and j = 1, . . . , m. Then x  ai, bj, for all i, j, which implies that there exists a1  · · ·  an  b1  · · ·  bm.

Then e(x) = e(a1  · · ·  an  b1  · · ·  bm). So x = a1  · · ·  an  b1  · · ·  bm. Since x is irreducible, it follows that x = a1  · · ·  an or x = b1  · · ·  bm. Then e(x) = u or e(x) = v. Hence e(x)  Irr(L(A)). Therefore e [Irr(A)]  Irr(L(A)). Now it is straightforward to show the inclusion Irr(L(A))  e [Irr(A)].
From now on, given a poset X,  , D(X) will denote the collection of all downsets of X and let us consider the bounded distributive lattice D(X), , , , X .
Let A be a finite distributive nearlattice and L(A), e its free distributive lattice extension. Let us consider Irr(A) (Irr(L(A))) as a sub-poset of A (L(A)), that is, x  y if and only if x  y = y, for all x, y  Irr(A). Since L(A) is a finite distributive lattice, it follows that the map  : L(A)  D(Irr(L(A))) defined by (u) = {z  Irr(L(A)) : u z} is an isomorphism. Hence, by Proposition 5.4, we have that the map  : L(A)  D(Irr(A)) given by (u) = {x  Irr(A) : u e(x)} is an isomorphism. Therefore, we have the following.
Proposition 5.5. For every finite distributive nearlattice A, we have that D(Irr(A)), e is the free distributive lattice extension of A, where e : A  D(Irr(A)) is given by e(a) = (  e)(a) = {x  Irr(A) : a x}.
Definition 5.6. A DN-structure is a pair X,  such that X is a poset and  : D(X)  {0, 1} is a map satisfying the following:
(S1) (X) = 1; (S2) ([x)c) = 1, for all x  X; (S3) for all U, V  D(X), U  V implies (U )  (V ).
We say that a DN-structure X,  is finite if the poset X is finite. Let X,  be a DN-structure. We define
N(X) := {U  D(X) : (U ) = 1}.
Proposition 5.7. Let X,  be a finite DN-structure. Then N(X), , X is a distributive nearlattice and X,  = Irr(N(X)),  .
Proof. First let us show that N(X) is closed under . Let U1, U2  N(X). Thus (U1) = (U2) = 1. Then, since U1  U1U2, it follows by (S3) that (U1U2) = 1. Hence U1  U2  N(X)
Now let U1, U2, V  N(X) be such that V  U1, U2. Thus V  U1 U2. By (S3), we have U1 U2  N(X). Then, U1 U2 is the meet of U1 and U2 in [V )N(X). Hence [V )N(X), , , U, X is a bounded distributive lattice. Therefore, N(X), , X is a distributive nearlattice.
It is well-known that Irr(D(X)) = {[x)c : x  X}, and thus Irr(D(X)),  = X,  . Let us prove that Irr(N(X)) = Irr(D(X)). By (S2), we have Irr(D(X))  Irr(N(X)). Let now U  Irr(N(X)). Since U c is a finite upset of X, we have that U c = [x1)  · · ·  [xn), for some x1, . . . , xn  U c. Thus U = [x1)c  · · ·  [xn)c. Then, since U  Irr(N(X), we obtain that U = [xi)c, for some i = 1, . . . , n. Hence Irr(N(X))  Irr(D(X)). Therefore, we have that Irr(N(X)),  = X,  .
Let A, , 1 be a finite distributive nearlattice. Let S(A) = Irr(A),  .
Proposition 5.8. Let A, , 1 be a finite distributive nearlattice. Then, the pair S(A), A is a DN-structure, where A : D(S(A))  {0, 1} is the map defined by A(U ) = 1 if and only if (S(A) \ U ) exists in A.

Proof. It is straightforward to show directly that the map A satisfies conditions (S1)­(S3).
Given a finite distributive nearlattice A, we have that N(S(A)), , S(A) is a finite distributive nearlattice, where N(S(A)) = {U  D(S(A)) : A(U ) = 1}.
Theorem 5.9 (Discrete representation). Let A = A, , 1 be a finite distributive nearlattice. Then, A = N(S(A)).
Proof. From Proposition 5.5, we have that the map e : A  D(S(A)) is an Nembedding, where e(a) = {x  Irr(A) : a x}, for every a  A. Thus, A = e[A]. Let us show that e[A] = N(S(A)). Then,
U  N(S(A))  U  D(S(A)) and A(U ) = 1
 U  D(S(A)) and S(A) \ U exists in A
 there exists a  A such that U = {x  Irr(A) : a x}
 there exists a  A such that U = e(a)
 U  e[A]. Hence, A = e[A] = N(S(A)).
Remark 5.10. Let A be a finite distributive nearlattice. If A is in fact a lattice, then it follows that N(S(A)) = D(S(A)). Thus A = D(S(A)). Moreover, it is clear that the finite posets are in one-to-one correspondence with the DN-structures X,  such that (U ) = 1, for all U  D(X). Therefore, from the representation above established we can obtain the representation given by Birkhoff for finite distributive lattices.
