## Abstract

We develop a Nitsche finite element method for a model of Euler--Bernoulli beams with axial stiffness embedded in a two--dimensional elastic bulk domain. The beams have their own displacement fields, and the elastic subdomains created by the beam network are triangulated independently and are coupled to the beams weakly by use of Nitsche's method in the framework of hybridization.
