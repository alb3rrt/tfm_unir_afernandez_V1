Abstract: This paper is devoted to the complete algebraic and geometric classification of complex 4dimensional nilpotent left-symmetric algebras. The corresponding geometric variety has dimension 15 and decomposes into 3 irreducible components determined by the Zariski closures of two oneparameter families of algebras and a two-parameter family of algebras (see Theorem B). In particular, there are no rigid 4-dimensional complex nilpotent left symmetric algebras.
Keywords: left-symmetric algebras, Novikov algebras, assosymmetric algebras, nilpotent algebras, algebraic classification, central extension, geometric classification, degeneration.

INTRODUCTION
The algebraic classification (up to isomorphism) of algebras of dimension n from a certain variety defined by a certain family of polinomial identities is a classic problem in the theory of non-associative algebras. There are many results related to the algebraic classification of small-dimensional algebras in the varieties of Jordan, Lie, Leibniz, Zinbiel and many other algebras [9,10,12,15­17,23,25,29,30, 32, 34]. Another interesting direction in the classification of algebras is the geometric classification. There are many results related to the geometric classification of Jordan, Lie, Leibniz, Zinbiel and many other algebras [5,8,10,11,21,22,26,27,30,32,33,37,40]. An algebraic classification of complex 3-dimensional left-symmetric algebras is given in [2]. In the present paper, we give the algebraic and geometric classification of 4-dimensional nilpotent left-symmetric algebras.
Left-symmetric algebras (or under other names like Koszul­Vinberg algebras, quasi-associative algebras, pre-Lie algebras, and so on) are a class of nonassociative algebras coming from the study of several topics in geometry and algebra, such as rooted tree algebras, convex homogeneous cones

[39], affine manifolds and affine structures on Lie groups [35], deformation of associative algebras [20], and so on. They are Lie-admissible algebras (in the sense that the commutators define Lie algebra structures) whose left multiplication operators form a Lie algebra. The class of left-symmetric algebras contains associative algebras, Novikov algebras and assosymmetric algebras as subvarieties. The variety of left-symmetric algebras is defined by the following identity:
(xy)z - x(yz) = (yx)z - y(xz).
The variety of Novikov algebras is a subclass of left-symmetric algebras defined by the following identity:
(xy)z = (xz)y.
Furthermore, left-symmetric algebras are a kind of natural algebraic systems appearing in many fields in mathematics and mathematical physics. Perhaps this is one of the most attractive and interesting places. As it was pointed out in a paper of Chapoton and Livernet [13], the left-symmetric algebra "deserves more attention than it has been given." For example, left-symmetric algebras appear as an underlying structure of those Lie algebras that possess a phase space, thus "they form a natural category from the point of view of classical and quantum mechanics" [36]; they are the underlying algebraic structures of vertex algebras [3]; there is a correspondence between left-symmetric algebras and complex product structures on Lie algebras [1], which plays an important role in the theory of hypercomplex and hypersymplectic manifolds; left-symmetric algebras have close relations with certain integrable systems [6], classical and quantum Yang­Baxter equation [18]; Poisson brackets and infinite-dimensional Lie algebras [4, 19], operads [13], quantum field theory [14], and so on (see [7] and the references therein).
Our method for classifying nilpotent left-symmetric algebras is based on the calculation of central extensions of nilpotent algebras of smaller dimensions from the same variety. The algebraic study of central extensions of Lie and non-Lie algebras has been an important topic for years [24, 31, 38]. First, Skjelbred and Sund used central extensions of Lie algebras to obtain a classification of nilpotent Lie algebras [38]. After that, using the method described by Skjelbred and Sund, all non-Lie central extensions of all 4-dimensional Malcev algebras were described [24], and also all non-associative central extensions of 3-dimensional Jordan algebras. Note that the Skjelbred-Sund method of central extensions is an important tool in the classification of nilpotent algebras, which was used to describe all 4-dimensional nilpotent associative algebras [17], all 5-dimensional nilpotent Jordan algebras [23], all 5-dimensional nilpotent restricted Lie algebras [15], all 6-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras [12, 16], all 6-dimensional nilpotent Malcev algebras [25] and some others.
1. THE ALGEBRAIC CLASSIFICATION OF NILPOTENT LEFT-SYMMETRIC ALGEBRAS
1.1. Method of classification of nilpotent algebras. Throughout this paper, we use the notations and methods well written in [24], which we have adapted for the left-symmetric case with some modifications. Further in this section we give some important definitions.

3
Let (A, ·) be a left-symmetric algebra over C and V a vector space over C. The C-linear space Z2 (A, V) is defined as the set of all bilinear maps  : A × A - V such that
(xy, z) - (x, yz) = (yx, z) - (y, xz).
These elements will be called cocycles. For a linear map f from A to V, if we define f : A × A - V by f (x, y) = f (xy), then f  Z2 (A, V). We define B2 (A, V) = { = f : f  Hom (A, V)}. We define the second cohomology space H2 (A, V) as the quotient space Z2 (A, V) B2 (A, V).

Let Aut(A) be the automorphism group of A and let   Aut(A). For   Z2 (A, V) define the action of the group Aut(A) on Z2 (A, V) by (x, y) =  ( (x) ,  (y)). It is easy to verify that B2 (A, V) is invariant under the action of Aut(A). So, we have an induced action of Aut(A) on H2 (A, V).

Let A be a left-symmetric algebra of dimension m over C and V be a C-vector space of dimension

k. by

Given a [x + x,

bilinear map y + y]A =

, define on the linear space xy + (x, y) for all x, y 

A A,

= x,

A y

 

V the bilinear product " [-, -]A " V. The algebra A is called a k-

dimensional central extension of A by V. One can easily check that A is a left-symmetric algebra if

and only if   Z2(A, V).

Call the set Ann() = {x  A :  (x, A) +  (A, x) = 0} the annihilator of . We recall that the

annihilator of an algebra A is defined as the ideal Ann(A) = {x  A : xA + Ax = 0}. Observe

that Ann (A) = (Ann()  Ann(A))  V.

The following result shows that every algebra with a non-zero annihilator is a central extension of a smaller-dimensional algebra.
Lemma 1. Let A be an n-dimensional left-symmetric algebra such that dim(Ann(A)) = m = 0. Then there exists, up to isomorphism, a unique (n - m)-dimensional left-symmetric algebra A and a bilinear map   Z2(A, V) with Ann(A)  Ann() = 0, where V is a vector space of dimension m, such that A = A and A/ Ann(A) = A.
Proof. Let A be a linear complement of Ann(A) in A. Define a linear map P : A - A by P (x + v) = x for x  A and v  Ann(A), and define a multiplication on A by [x, y]A = P (xy) for x, y  A. For x, y  A, we have
P (xy) = P ((x - P (x) + P (x))(y - P (y) + P (y))) = P (P (x)P (y)) = [P (x), P (y)]A. Since P is a homomorphism P (A) = A is a left-symmetric algebra and A/ Ann(A) = A, which gives us the uniqueness. Now, define the map  : A × A - Ann(A) by (x, y) = xy - [x, y]A. Thus, A is A and therefore   Z2(A, V) and Ann(A)  Ann() = 0.
Definition 2. Let A be an algebra and I be a subspace of Ann(A). If A = A0  I then I is called an annihilator component of A. A central extension of an algebra A without annihilator component is called a non-split central extension.

4
Our task is to find all central extensions of an algebra A by a space V. In order to solve the isomorphism problem we need to study the action of Aut(A) on H2 (A, V). To do that, let us fix a
s
basis e1, . . . , es of V, and   Z2 (A, V). Then  can be uniquely written as  (x, y) = i (x, y) ei,
i=1
where i  Z2 (A, C). Moreover, Ann() = Ann(1)  Ann(2)  . . .  Ann(s). Furthermore,   B2 (A, V) if and only if all i  B2 (A, C). It is not difficult to prove (see [24, Lemma 13]) that
s
given a left-symmetric algebra A, if we write as above  (x, y) = i (x, y) ei  Z2 (A, V) and
i=1
Ann()Ann (A) = 0, then A has a nonzero annihilator component if and only if [1] , [2] , . . . , [s] are linearly dependent in H2 (A, C).

Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space over C. The Grassmannian Gk (V) is the set of all k-dimensional linear subspaces of V. Let Gs (H2 (A, C)) be the Grassmannian of subspaces of dimension s in H2 (A, C). There is a natural action of Aut(A) on Gs (H2 (A, C)). Let   Aut(A). For W = [1] , [2] , . . . , [s]  Gs (H2 (A, C)) define W = [1] , [2] , . . . , [s] . We denote the orbit of W  Gs (H2 (A, C)) under the action of Aut(A) by Orb(W ). Given

W1 = [1] , [2] , . . . , [s] , W2 = [1] , [2] , . . . , [s]  Gs H2 (A, C) ,

s

s

we easily have that if W1 = W2, then Ann(i)  Ann (A) = Ann(i)  Ann(A), and therefore

i=1

i=1

we can introduce the set

s
Ts(A) = W = [1] , [2] , . . . , [s]  Gs H2 (A, C) : Ann(i)  Ann(A) = 0 ,
i=1

which is stable under the action of Aut(A).

Now, let V be an s-dimensional linear space and let us denote by E (A, V) the set of all non-split s-dimensional central extensions of A by V. By the above, we can write
s
E (A, V) = A :  (x, y) = i (x, y) ei and [1] , [2] , . . . , [s]  Ts(A) .
i=1
We also have the following result, which can be proved as in [24, Lemma 17].
s
Lemma 3. Let A, A  E (A, V). Suppose that  (x, y) = i (x, y) ei and  (x, y) =
i=1 s
i (x, y) ei. Then the left-symmetric algebras A and A are isomorphic if and only if
i=1
Orb [1] , [2] , . . . , [s] = Orb [1] , [2] , . . . , [s] .

5
This shows that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the set of Aut(A)-orbits on Ts (A) and the set of isomorphism classes in E (A, V). Consequently we have a procedure that allows us, given a left-symmetric algebra A of dimension n - s, to construct all non-split central extensions of A. This procedure is:
(1) For a given left-symmetric algebra A of dimension n - s, determine H2(A, C), Ann(A) and Aut(A).
(2) Determine the set of Aut(A)-orbits on Ts(A). (3) For each orbit, construct the left-symmetric algebra associated with a representative of it.
The above described method gives all (Novikov and non-Novikov) left-symmetric algebras. But we are interested in developing this method in such a way that it only gives non-Novikov left-symmetric algebras, because the classification of all Novikov algebras is given in [28]. Clearly, any central extension of a non-Novikov left-symmetric algebra is non-Novikov. But a Novikov algebra may have extensions which are not Novikov algebras. More precisely, let N be a Novikov algebra and   Z2L(N, C). Then N is a Novikov algebra if and only if
(xy, z) = (xz, y),
for all x, y, z  N. Define the subspace Z2N(N, C) of Z2L(N, C) by
Z2N(N, C) =   Z2L(N, C) : (xy, z) = (xz, y) for all x, y, z  N .
Observe that B2(N, C)  Z2N(N, C). Let H2N(N, C) = Z2N(N, C) B2(N, C). Then H2N(N, C) is a subspace of H2L(N, C). Define
Rs(N) = W  Ts(N) : W  Gs(H2N(N, C)) , Us(N) = W  Ts(N) : W / Gs(H2N(N, C)) .
Then Ts(N) = Rs(N) · Us(N). The sets Rs(N) and Us(N) are stable under the action of Aut(N). Thus, the left-symmetric algebras corresponding to the representatives of Aut(N)-orbits on Rs(N) are Novikov algebras, while those corresponding to the representatives of Aut(N)-orbits on Us(N) are not Novikov algebras. Hence, we may construct all non-split non-Novikov left-symmetric algebras A of dimension n with s-dimensional annihilator from a given left-symmetric algebra A of dimension n - s in the following way:
(1) If A is non-Novikov, then apply the Procedure. (2) Otherwise, do the following:
(a) Determine Us(A) and Aut(A). (b) Determine the set of Aut(A)-orbits on Us(A). (c) For each orbit, construct the left-symmetric algebra corresponding to one of its represen-
tatives.
1.2. Notations. Let us introduce the following notations. Let A be a nilpotent algebra with a basis e1, e2, . . . , en. Then by ij we will denote the bilinear form ij : A × A - C with ij(el, em) = iljm. The set {ij : 1  i, j  n} is a basis for the linear space of bilinear forms on A, so every

6

  Z2(A, V) can be uniquely written as  =

cijij, where cij  C. Let us fix the following

notations:

1i,jn

Lij -- jth i-dimensional left-symmetric (non-Novikov) algebra. Lij -- jth i-dimensional left-symmetric (Novikov) algebra.
1.3. The algebraic classification of 3-dimensional nilpotent left-symmetric algebras. There are no nontrivial 1-dimensional nilpotent left-symmetric algebras. There is only one nontrivial 2dimensional nilpotent left-symmetric algebra (it is the non-split central extension of the 1-dimensional algebra with zero product):

L201 : e1e1 = e2. The classification of all non-split 3-dimensional nilpotent left-symmetric algebras is known:

L302

: e1e1 = e3 e2e2 = e3

L303

: e1e2 = e3 e2e1 = -e3

L304() : e1e1 = e3 e2e1 = e3 e2e2 = e3

L305

: e1e1 = e2 e2e1 = e3

L306() : e1e1 = e2 e1e2 = e3 e2e1 = e3.

Remark 4. Since H2L(L304(0)) = H2N(L304(0)), then central extensions of the algebra L304(0) give us only Novikov algebras.

1.4.2. Central extensions of L301. Let us use the following notations:
1 = [12], 2 = [13], 3 = [21], 4 = [31], 5 = [33], 6 = [23].

2 = 1xu + 2xt + 5zt + 6yt, 4 = 3xu + 4xt + 5zt + 6zu, 6 = 6x2t.

Since H2L(L301) = H2N(L301)  6 and we are interested only in new algebras, we have 6 = 0.

Then

Hence, we have the following distints orbits

which give the following new algebras:

L401 : e1e1 = e2 e1e2 = e4 e2e3 = e4 e3e1 = e4 L402 : e1e1 = e2 e2e3 = e4 e3e1 = e4 L403 : e1e1 = e2 e1e2 = e4 e2e3 = e4

Since H2L(L302) = H2N(L302)  4, 5 and we are interested only in new algebras, we have (4, 5) = (0, 0). Moreover, without loss of generality, one can assume 4 = 0. Then we have

we

Since the automorphism  = diag(1, -1, 1) acts as

(4 + i5) = 4 - i5 and (1 + 4 + i5) = 1 + 4 - i5 ,

we have two representatives of distinct orbits 4 + i5 and 1 + 4 + i5 . Hence, we have the following distints orbits
4 , 1 + 4 , 4 + i5 and 1 + 4 + i5 , which give the following new algebras:

L405 : e1e1 = e3 e2e2 = e3 e3e1 = e4 L406 : e1e1 = e3 e1e2 = e4 e2e2 = e3 e3e1 = e4 L407 : e1e1 = e3 e2e2 = e3 e3e1 = e4 e3e2 = ie4 L408 : e1e1 = e3 e1e2 = e4 e2e2 = e3 e3e1 = e4 e3e2 = ie4

Since H2L(L303) = H2N(L303)  4, 5 , we have (4, 5) = (0, 0). Moreover, without loss of

Summarizing, we have the following distinct orbits

4 and 3 + 4 .

Hence, we have the following new algebras:

Since H2L(L304()=0) = H2N(L304()=0)  4, 5 , we have (4, 5) = (0, 0). Then we have the following cases.

Since H2L(L305) = H2N(L305)  3, 4 , we have (3, 4) = (0, 0). Then we have the following cases.

Hence, we have the following distints orbits

which give the following new algebras:

Since H2L(L306()) = H2N(L306())  3 , we have 3 = 0. Then we have the following cases

(1) if  = 0, then we have the representatives 2 + 3 and 1 + 2 + 3 depending on

2. THE GEOMETRIC CLASSIFICATION OF NILPOTENT LEFT-SYMMETRIC ALGEBRAS
2.1. Definitions and notation. Given an n-dimensional vector space V, the set Hom(VV, V) = VVV is a vector space of dimension n3. This space has the structure of the affine variety Cn3. Indeed, let us fix a basis e1, . . . , en of V. Then any µ  Hom(V  V, V) is determined by n3 structure constants ckij  C such that

15
n
µ(ei  ej) = ckijek. A subset of Hom(V  V, V) is Zariski-closed if it can be defined by a set of polynomial
k=1
equations in the variables ckij (1  i, j, k  n). Let T be a set of polynomial identities. The set of algebra structures on V satisfying polynomial identities
from T forms a Zariski-closed subset of the variety Hom(V  V, V). We denote this subset by L(T ). The general linear group GL(V) acts on L(T ) by conjugation:
(g  µ)(x  y) = gµ(g-1x  g-1y)
for x, y  V, µ  L(T )  Hom(V  V, V) and g  GL(V). Thus, L(T ) is decomposed into GL(V)-orbits that correspond to the isomorphism classes of algebras. Let O(µ) denote the orbit of µ  L(T ) under the action of GL(V) and O(µ) denote the Zariski closure of O(µ).
Let A and B be two n-dimensional algebras satisfying the identities from T , and let µ,   L(T ) represent A and B, respectively. We say that A degenerates to B and write A  B if   O(µ). Note that in this case we have O()  O(µ). Hence, the definition of a degeneration does not depend on the choice of µ and . If A = B, then the assertion A  B is called a proper degeneration. We write A  B if   O(µ).
Let A be represented by µ  L(T ). Then A is rigid in L(T ) if O(µ) is an open subset of L(T ). Recall that a subset of a variety is called irreducible if it cannot be represented as a union of two non-trivial closed subsets. A maximal irreducible closed subset of a variety is called an irreducible component. It is well known that any affine variety can be represented as a finite union of its irreducible components in a unique way. The algebra A is rigid in L(T ) if and only if O(µ) is an irreducible component of L(T ).
Given the spaces U and W , we write simply U > W instead of dim U > dim W .

2.2. Method of the description of degenerations of algebras. In the present work we use the methods applied to Lie algebras in [8, 21, 22, 37]. First of all, if A  B and A = B, then Der(A) < Der(B), where Der(A)

is the Lie algebra of derivations of A. We compute the dimensions of algebras of derivations and check the

assertion A  B only for A and B such that Der(A) < Der(B).

To prove degenerations, we construct families of matrices parametrized by t. Namely, let A and B be two

algebras represented by the structures µ and  from L(T ) respectively. Let e1, . . . , en be a basis of V and ckij

(1  such

i, j, that

k  n) Eit =

be
n

the structure aji (t)ej (1 

constants of  in this i  n) form a basis

basis. If of V for

there any t

exist aji (t)  C, and

 C (1  i, j the structure

 n, t  constants

C) of µ

j=1

in the basis E1t, . . . , Ent are such rational functions ckij(t)  C(t) that ckij(0) = ckij, then A  B. In this case

E1t , . . . , Ent is called a parametrized basis for A  B. To simplify our equations, we will use the notation Ai = ei, . . . , en , i = 1, . . . , n and write simply ApAq  Ar instead of ckij = 0 (i  p, j  q, k < r).

Since the variety of 4-dimensional nilpotent left-symmetric algebras contains infinitely many non-

isomorphic algebras, we have to do some additional work. Let A() := {A()}I be a series of algebras, and let B be another algebra. Suppose that for   I, A() is represented by the structure µ()  L(T )

and B  L(T ) is represented by the structure . Then we say that A()  B if   I O(µ()), and
A()  B if   I O(µ()). Let A(), B, µ() (  I) and  be as above. To prove A()  B it is enough to construct a family of pairs
(f (t), g(t)) parametrized by t  C, where f (t)  I and g(t)  GL(V). Namely, let e1, . . . , en be a basis of V and ckij (1  i, j, k  n) be the structure constants of  in this basis. If we construct aji : C  C (1  i, j  n)

16

and f : C  I such that Eit = n aji (t)ej (1  i  n) form a basis of V for any t  C, and the structure
j=1
constants of µf(t) in the basis E1t , . . . , Ent are such rational functions ckij(t)  C(t) that ckij(0) = ckij, then A()  B. In this case E1t, . . . , Ent and f (t) are called a parametrized basis and a parametrized index for A()  B, respectively.
We now explain how to prove A()  B. Note that if Der A() > Der B for all   I, then A()  B. One can also use the following Lemma, whose proof is the same as the proof of Lemma 1.5 from [21].
Lemma 5. Let B be a Borel subgroup of GL(V) and R  L(T ) be a B-stable closed subset. If A()  B and for any   I the algebra A() can be represented by a structure µ()  R, then there is   R representing B.

2.3. The geometric classification of 4-dimensional nilpotent left-symmetric algebras. The main result of the present section is the following theorem.

Theorem B. The variety of 4-dimensional nilpotent left-symmetric algebras has dimension 15 and it has three irreducible components defined by infinite families of algebras L412(), L421() and L423(, ).
Proof. Recall that the description of all irreducible components of 4-dimensional nilpotent Novikov algebras was given in [28]. Using the cited result, we can see that the variety of 4-dimensional Novikov algebras has two irreducible components given by the following families of algebras:

N240() : e1e2 = e3 e1e1 = e4 e1e3 = e4

e2e2 = e4 e2e3 = e4 e3e2 = -e4

N242() : e1e1 = e2 e1e2 = e3 e1e3 = (2 - )e4 e2e1 = e4 e2e2 = e4 e3e1 = e4

Now we can prove that the variety of 4-dimensional nilpotent left-symmetric algebras has three irreducible components. One can easily compute that
Der L412() = 2, Der L421() = 2, Der L423(, ) = 3.
