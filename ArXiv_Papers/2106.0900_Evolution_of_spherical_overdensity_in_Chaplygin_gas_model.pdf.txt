Abstract. Even though many scalar field models of dark energy have been considered in the literature, there is another interesting class of dark energy models involving a fluid known as a Chaplygin gas. In addition to describing the dark energy, both scalar-tensor model and the Chaplygin gas model are suitable candidates for explaining the spherical cosmological collapse. One of the most well-known scalar field models is the quintessence model, which was first introduced to explain an accelerating expanding universe. Using a special form of the quintessence model that is equivalent to Chaplygin gas, we describe evolution of a spherical collapse. We study the cosmological properties of the quintessence field with a special potential. In addition to the quintessence model, that can be converted into a Chaplygin gas model in a particular case, we claim that the fixed-potential tachyonic model is equivalent to the Chaplygin gas model. In this work, we obtain the spherical collapse parameters: the virialized overdensity parameters, radius, the energy density at the turnaround moment, etc. We compare the results of the proposed model with the standard model of cosmology and the Einstein­de Sitter model. We show that the formation of the large-scale structures within the framework of a Chaplygin gas model happens earlier than predicted in the standard model.

1 Introduction
Almost decades after the introduction of the Einstein-de sitter dust model, observations of the redshift in type Ia supernova suggested a positive acceleration of the universe [1]. These results led to the proposal of an unknown exotic matter which is called dark energy and it satisfies the condition  + 3P < 0 where  represents the density of the matter and P denotes the pressure. There have been many candidates for the dark energy, the simplest model is based on the cosmological constant which is not dynamic. The cosmological constant faces two issues, "fine tuning" and "the coincidence problem" [2]. Models of interacting dark energy were introduced to solve the problem of coincidence. Quintessence [3] and K-essence [4] models were proposed to solve such issues, these models are based on either non-minimally or minimally coupled scalar fields [5,6]. Although these models face the challenge of finetuning, which states that, in terms of mathematical laws and probabilities, the universe could have been created

in innumerable different ways. However, our universe is only a very special case. In recent literature some models have been investigated in which, in order to solve the fine tuning problem, it is necessary to consider dark energy in the initial stage of the universe [1]. Therefore, to explain the number of structures at present, the contribution of dark energy cannot be ignored. On the one hand, the process of structure formation should occur earlier and much slower than predicted in the standard cosmological model. Additionally, the analytical calculations show that by considering some assumptions for the collapse of a homogeneous and isotropic sphere, one can conclude that the number of structures formed within the scalar-tensor models is more than predicted in the CDM model. Also, numerical analyses show that the classical spherical model is in good agreement with the simulations [7]. The dynamics of the overdensity parameter depend on the evolution of the flux, which causes the universe to expand. So, dark energy models, such as scalar-tensor models, can describe the growth of structures. One of the most interesting ideas for the unification of dark matter and dark energy is the Chaplygin gas model in which the dark sector of the universe is expressed in terms of a single component that serves for both dark energy and dark matter. Chaplygin gas is a perfect fluid that

2 Quintessence field as a Chaplygin gas

In 1988, Ratra and Peebles [26] proposed a scenario in which one can use a scalar field which is universal, rolling, self-interacting, and homogeneous to describe the dynamical energy density of the universe. Models based on this scenario are known as quintessence. Also, the quintessence fields are one of the best candidates for the scalar field to explain the formation of the large scale structures in the universe. Following Ratra and Peebles, quintessence fields were studied more by Robert R. Caldwel, Duhal Dave and Paul Steinhardt [27]. Some people even considered it as the fifth fundamental force of nature. The action for the quintessence field can be written as

Probably some factors such as inhomogeneous distribution of matter are responsible for the growth of the perturbations in the early universe that caused the formation of the cosmological structures during the period of matterdominant. To understand the perturbations growth in the matter-dominant epoch which formed the structures that we have today, we consider a slice of the expanding universe with a radius of R and non-uniform density  = ¯(1+ ) (where  denotes overdensity parameter in a matterdominant universe). Thus, the linear evolution of overdensity parameter (Appendix B) can be written as

Here, we assume that the collapse is spherical and homogeneous. We also ignore the effects of rotation and shear. Evidently, a better approximation for the spherical collapse can be obtained if one considers an angular momentum. However, note that we do not see shear effect for a sphere, and the shear tensor equals to zero. Nevertheless, we write an equation of evolution of overdensity parameter in a non-linear regime as

Note that prime denotes the derivative with respect to z. The value of  approaches to zero for the large redshifts (early times), while from the observations we know that the value of this parameter for small z (present time) approximately equals to 0.7. From Fig. 2, one can see that the value of  in the quintessence model is very close to the prediction of the standard model of cosmology. Now, using the above equations, we find the relation between the Hubble parameter and the energy density of the scalar field as follows

In the equations mentioned above, , E, and a denote density contrast, dimensionless Hubble parameter, and the scale factor; respectively. From WMAP and Planck's observations we approximately have m = 0.3. We numerically solve the non-linear growth equations of the perturbations. We imposed the initial conditions in a way to have the growth of non-linear perturbations larger than 107. Note that these initial conditions are necessary for the formation of the large scale structures. In Fig. 4 and Fig.5, we plot linear and non-linear density contrast versus the scale factor and compare the results of the quintessence model with CDM and coupled tachyon model. Therefore, the results of the quintessence model are similar to the standard cosmological model.

In this section, our goal is to understand how the perturbations in the universe grow within the framework of the quintessence model and form a dense structure. The intended area expands within an expanding background up to a maximum radius Rmax. Then the expansion of the perturbed region stops, and the process of collapse continues. However, it is important to note that the intended area does not collapse to a singular point, and the expanding process ends at half of the maximum radius, which is called virialized radius. Hence, it is essential to realize that the intended area does not collapse to a singular point,

and in half of the maximum radius, it is virialized, making the collapse to stop [28,29]. To find the growth of the perturbations, we numerically solve the equation (22). As mentioned before, solving this equation is very sensitive to the choice of the initial conditions. Thus, to solve the equation and find the correct value for the linear overdensity parameter c. The value of this parameter in the Eds model is constant and equals to 1.68 [7]. However, one can see from Fig. 6 that overdensity parameter changes with the redshift, and eventually, both models share the value of the Eds model. To determine the virialized overdensity parameter, let us consider the sphere with density in the background of b as defined below

where xc is defined as ac/ata. ac and ata denote the scale factor in the virialization and the turn-around epochs; respectively. In the equation (25),  and  present the radius of structures and perturbations in the turn-around

time. In the Eds model, The value of V is constant and equals to 178. However, in the other two models, it varies with the redshift. But for the large redshifts, V has the same value as the Eds model. In Fig .6, we plot the virialized overdensity parameter versus zc for the quintessence, CDM , NMCT, and Eds models. Virialized overdensity is a constant for the Eds model, and it equals to 178. However, for the other models, it varies with the redshift. For the quintessence model and the standard model, the value of this parameter is approximately the same. But in the tachyonic model, the slope of the graph approaches the Eds model slightly faster, which means that the perturbations in the tachyonic model turn to virialized overdensity faster. Thus, the possibility for the formation of the structures in this model occurs sooner than the other two models. As we mentioned earlier, the growth of the perturbations during the collapse phase is virilized at half of the maximum radius, and so the structures can be formed. At the turn-around moment, we plot the radius of the cosmological structures  for the four models, as shown in Fig. 7. One can see that  takes its maximum value for the Eds model, which is 0.5. However, in the other models, the value of  depends on the redshift and for higher redshifts, it tends to the Eds values. The  parameter that appears in equation (25) is as fol-

It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the parameter  for the Eds model is a constant and equal to 5.6. But, for the other models, it varies with respect to virialized redshift, and for large redshifts takes a value which is close to what it has in the Eds model. But the coupled tachyonic model tends to the Eds model with a steeper slope, which means that within the framework of the tachyonic model, during virialization, the structures take the return path faster than other models. Therefore, it can be concluded that in this model the structures are formed faster than the other models.

So, the energy density of the tachyon and matter field are as follows

where prime represents the derivative with respect to z. According to the Planck's recent results, this parameter is approximately 0.7, but tends to zero for the very large redshifts [7]. As discussed in the previous section, the spherical collapse model for a fixed-potential tachyonic model (FPTM) which is equivalent to a Chaplygin gas can be studied. In Fig. 9, the EoS parameter  is plotted for both the FPTM and the CDM models. One can see that, for the small redshifts, the value of  approaches to -1. In Fig. 10, the behaviour of energy density of the FPTM is compared with the standard model of cosmology. The plot shows that the variation of (z) for the different redshifts is similar for both of the models. The Hubble dimensionless parameter E(z) is plotted in Fig. 11. This graph shows the compatibility of the fixedpotential tachyon model with the standard cosmological model. We solve equations (22) and (23) for the FPTM and obtained the growth of linear and non-linear tachyonic perturbations. In Fig. 12 and Fig. 13, we plot the

tions and plot the evolution of virialized overdensity V , linear overdensity c, radius of the structure  and  parameters in figures 14, 15, 16 and 17; respectively. These
graphs show that in the tachyonic model, the c and  curves tend to Eds model faster than the quintessence and standard models. Therefore, we conclude that within the framework of the tachyon model, the perturbations

over time, and in the case of small redshifts, the standard cosmological model was favored. Also, using the parameter of the equation of state and the continuity equation, we obtained the evolution of the Hubble dimensionless parameter and the energy density of the scalar field. The results showed that within the framework of the Chaplygin gas model, during virialization, the structures take the return path faster than other models. Therefore, it can be concluded that in this model, the structures are formed faster than the other models. Then, using the numerical solution of the differential equations of growth of non-linear and linear perturbation, we investigated the structure formation parameters. In studying the structure formation of the spherical collapse model, we obtained parameters such as structure radius, virialized overdensity V and  parameters. By considering the Chaplygin gas as an ordinary tachyonic scalar field, , one can obtain a corresponding potential for it. Finally, we considered the fixed-potential tachyon model as another candidate for the Chaplygin gas and calculated all the parameters of the spherical collapse for it. During virialization, the results confirmed that in the framework of the fixed potential tachyonic model, the structures take the return path faster than other models. Therefore, it can be concluded that in this model, the structures are formed faster than the other models. Therefore, we conclude that the Chaplygin gas model can properly explain the spherical collapse of the large-scale structures.

where  denotes the tachyonic field. In equation (39), one can treat the potential as a constant, and find the EoS for the Chaplygin gas. Now, using equation (38) and the continuity equation  + 3(a /a)( + P ) = 0, we find

(40)

where A and B are positive constants and a is the scale

factor. One can see that for a << (B/A)1/6, the energy

density  will be in the order of  much larger than (B/A)1/6,  tends

B/a3 andwhen a is to -P  A. Thus,

one can conclude that in the past, when the scale factor

was smaller, the Chaplygin gas can be considered as a

pressureless matter. As we get closer to the present time,

the scale factor grows, and the density of the Chaplygin

gas becomes the same as the density of cosmological con-

stant. Therefore, this fluid can be the source of undergo-

ing accelerated expansion at the current time. Now, we

will show that by choosing a particular potential in the

quintessence model [30], we obtain the equation of state

of the Chaplygin gas. In the quintessence model, the en-

ergy density of the scalar field and its pressure are written

as  = 2/2 + V () and P = 2/2 - V (). Using these

equations, we find

2 = P + ,

V () = ( - P )/2.

where v is velocity, and  is gravitational potential. The physical coordinate r that is related to the comoving coordinate x via r = ax in which a is the scale factor. Since it is not possible to find a general solution to the nonlinear equations, we write the quantities such as density, pressure, and gravitational potential as two parts of the background field and the perturbations around it. Writing these quantities in the comoving coordinates, the energy density, the equation of state, velocity, and the gravitational potential take the following forms

(x, t) = ¯[1 + (x, t)],

(52)

P = (x, t),

(53)

v(x, t) = a[H(a)x + u(x, t)],

(54)

and

Using the quantities defined above, the equations of the dynamics of the fluid can be written as

which can be used to define 2 = ijij and 2 = ij ij . Now if we take derivative from equation (56) with respect to time and use equations (56, 57, 58 and 59) , we obtain
the following equation for the evolution of the spherical
