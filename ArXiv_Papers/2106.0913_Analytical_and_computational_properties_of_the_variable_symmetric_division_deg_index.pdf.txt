Abstract The aim of this work is to obtain new inequalities for the variable symmetric division deg index SDD(G) = uvE(G)(du /dv + dv /du ), and to characterize graphs extremal with respect to them. Here, uv denotes the edge of the graph G connecting the vertices u and v, du is the degree of the vertex u, and   R. Some of these inequalities generalize and improve previous results for the symmetric division deg index. In addition, we computationally apply the SDD(G) index on random graphs and show that the ratio SDDa(G) /n (n being the order of the graph) depends only on the average degree d .

of the vertex u, are studied in mathematical chemistry. The single number X(G), representing a chemical structure in graph-theoretical terms via the molecular graph, is called a topological descriptor and if in addition it correlates with a molecular property it is called a topological index. Remarkably, topological indices capture physical properties of a molecule in a single number.
Hundreds of topological indices have been proposed and studied over more than 40 years. Among them, probably the most popular descriptors are the Randi´c connectivity index and the Zagreb indices. The first and second Zagreb indices, denoted by M1 and M2, respectively, were introduced by Gutman and Trinajsti´c in 1972 (see [1]) as

M1(G) =

d2u,

uV (G)

M2(G) =

dudv .

uvE(G)

For details of the applications and mathematical theory of Zagreb indices see [2­4], and

the references therein.

The concept of variable molecular descriptors was proposed as a new way of

characterizing heteroatoms in molecules (see [5,6]), but also to assess structural differences

(e.g., the relative role of carbon atoms of acyclic and cyclic parts in alkylcycloalkanes [7]).

The idea behind the variable molecular descriptors is that the variables are determined

during the regression so that the standard error of estimate for a particular studied

property is as small as possible (see, e.g., [8]).

In this line of ideas, the variable versions of the first and second Zagreb indices were

defined as [8­10]

M1(G) =

du ,

uV (G)

M2(G) =

(dudv ) ,

uvE(G)

with   R. Evidently, M12 and M21 are the first and second Zagreb indices, respectively.

In addition, the first and second variable Zagreb indices include several known indices. As

examples we note that M1-1 is the inverse index ID, M13 is the forgotten index F , M2-1/2 is the Randi´c index, and M2-1 is the modified Zagreb index.

In 2011, Vukicevi´c proposed the variable symmetric division deg index [11]

SDD(G) =
uvE(G)

Note that SDD-(G) = SDD(G) and so, it suffices to consider positive values of . The symmetric division deg index is the best predictor of total surface area for

polychlorobiphenyls [12].

In this paper we perform studies of the variable symmetric division deg index from analytical and computational viewpoints.

2 Analytical study of the variable symmetric division deg index

Let us start by proving a monotonicity property of these indices.

Theorem 1 Let G be a graph and 0 <  < . Then

SDD(G)  SDD(G),
and the equality in the bound is attained if and only if each connected component of G is a regular graph.

Proof. Let us consider x  1. Thus, x  x- and

x- - 1  0, x - x  x- - x-,

x x- - 1  x- x- - 1 , x + x-  x + x-,

for every x  1. Since u(x) = x + x- satisfies u(1/x) = u(x) for every x > 0, we have x + x-  x + x- for every x > 0. Note that the equality is attained if and only if x = 1.
Thus, we have

SDD(G) =
uvE(G)

du dv

+

dv du


uvE(G)

du dv

+

dv du

= SDD(G).

The previous argument gives that the equality in the bound is attained if and only if du/dv = 1 for every uv  E(G), i.e., each connected component of G is a regular graph.

The next result relates the SDDa and the variable Zagreb indices.

Theorem 2 If G is a graph with minimum degree  and maximum degree , and  > 0,

then

22M2-(G)  SDD(G)  22M2-(G),

-2M12+1(G)  SDD(G)  -2M12+1(G), and the equality in each bound is attained if and only if G is regular.

Proof. First of all recall that for any function f we have

f (du) + f (dv) =

duf (du).

uvE(G)

uV (G)

In particular,

d2u + d2v =

d2u+1 = M1a+1(G).

uvE(G)

uV (G)

Since

SDD(G) =
uvE(G)

du dv

dv du

=

uvE(G)

and  > 0, we obtain

SDD(G)

=

d2u + d2v uvE(G) (dudv)

 22

(dudv )-

uvE(G)

= 22M2-(G),

and

SDD(G)

=

uvE(G)

d2u + d2v (du dv )

 22

(dudv )-

uvE(G)

= 22M2-(G).

We also have

d2u + d2v

d2u+1 = -2M12+1(G),

uV (G)

and

SDD(G)

=

uvE(G)

d2u + d2v (dudv )



-2
uvE(G)

d2u + d2v

= -2

d2u+1 = -2M12+1(G).

uV (G)

If G is a regular graph, then each lower bound and its corresponding upper bound are

the same, and they are equal to SDD(G). Assume now that the equality in either the first or second bound is attained. The

previous argument gives that we have either d2u + d2v = 22 for every uv  E(G) or d2u + d2v = 22 for every uv  E(G). Thus, du = dv =  for every uv  E(G), or du = dv =  for every uv  E(G). Hence, G is regular.
Finally, assume that the equality in either the third or fourth bound is attained.

The previous argument gives that we have either (dudv) = 2 for every uv  E(G) or (dudv) = 2 for every uv  E(G). Thus, du = dv =  for every uv  E(G), or du = dv =  for every uv  E(G). Therefore, G is regular.
We will need the following technical result.

Lemma 3 Let 0 < a < A. Then

a



x2 + x+

y2 y



A

for every a  x, y  A. The lower bound is attained if and only if x = y = a. The upper bound is attained if and only if x = y = A.

Proof. If a  x, y  A, then ax + ay  x2 + y2  Ax + Ay, and the statement holds. A family of degree­based topological indices, named Adriatic indices, was put forward
in [12, 13]. Twenty of them were selected as significant predictors. One of them, the inverse sum indeg index, ISI, was singled out in [12,13] as a significant predictor of total surface area of octane isomers. This index is defined as

I S I (G)

=

uvE(G)

du dv du + dv

=

uvE(G)

1 du

1 +

1 dv

.

Next, we relate SDD(G) with the variable inverse sum deg index defined, for each a  R,

as

I S Da (G)

=

uvE(G)

Note that ISD-1 is the inverse sum indeg index ISI.

Theorem 4 If G is a graph with m edges and minimum degree , and  > 0, then

SDD(G)



m2 I S D-(G)

and the equality in the bound is attained if and only if G is regular.

Proof. Cauchy-Schwarz inequality gives

Since Lemma 3 gives

for every   x, y  , we have

d-v 

= -SDD(G) ISD-(G).

If G is a regular graph, then SDD(G) = 2m, ISD-(G) = m/2 and the equality in the bound is attained.

Assume now that the equality in the bound is attained. Thus, by the previous

argument and Lemma 3 we have du = dv =  for every uv  E(G). Hence, G is regular.

The modified Narumi-Katayama index

N K(G) =

dduu =

dudv

uV (G)

uvE(G)

is introduced in [14], inspired in the Narumi-Katayama index defined in [15]. Next, we prove an inequality relating the modified Narumi-Katayama index with SDD(G).

Theorem 5 Let G be a graph with m edges and minimum degree , and  > 0. Then SDD(G)  22mN K(G)-/m,
and the equality in the bound is attained if and only if G is a regular graph.

Proof. Using the fact that the geometric mean is at most the arithmetic mean, we obtain

1 m

SDD(G)

22

1 m

uvE(G)

1 (du dv )



22 
uvE(G)

1 (dudv)



= 22N K(G)-/m.

If G is a regular graph, then

22mN K(G)-/m = 22m 2m -/m = 2m = SDD(G).

Finally, assume that the equality in the bound is attained. The previous argument gives that d2u + d2v = 22 for every uv  E(G), and so, du = dv =  for every uv  E(G). Hence, G is a regular graph.
Next, we obtain additional bounds of SDD which do not involve other topological indices.

Theorem 6 Let G be a graph with m edges, minimum degree  and maximum degree  + 1,  > 0 and A the cardinality of the set of edges uv  E(G) with du = dv. Then A is an even integer and

SDD(G) = 2m + A

(

+ 1) 

+

(

 + 1)

-

.

Proof. Let F = {uv  E(G) : du = dv}, then A is the cardinality of the set F . Since the

minimum degree of G is  and its maximum degree is  + 1, if uv  F , then du =  and

dv =  + 1 or viceversa, and therefore

du dv

+

dv du

=

(

+ 1)

(

 + 1)

.

If uv  F c = E(G) \ F , then du = dv =  or du = dv =  + 1, and therefore

du dv

+

dv du

=

2.

Since there are exactly A edges in F and m - A edges in F c, we have

SDD(G) =
uvE(G)

du dv

 + ( + 1)

uvF c uvF

= 2m - 2A + A

(

+

(

.

This gives the equality. Seeking for a contradiction assume that A is an odd integer. Let 1 be the subgraph of G induced by the n1 vertices with degree  in V (G),
and denote by m1 the cardinality of the set of edges of 1. Handshaking Lemma gives n1 - A = 2m1. Since A is an odd integer,  is also an odd integer. Thus,  + 1 is an even integer.

Let 2 be the subgraph of G induced by the n2 vertices with degree  + 1 in V (G), and denote by m2 the cardinality of the set of edges of 2. Handshaking Lemma gives n2( + 1) - A = 2m2, a contradiction, since A is an odd integer and  + 1 is an even integer.
Thus, we conclude that A is an even integer. We will need the following result in the proof of Theorem 8 below.

Lemma 7 Given  > 0, consider the function u : (0, )  (0, ) defined as u(t) = t + t-. Then u is strictly decreasing on (0, 1], u is strictly increasing on [1, ) and u(t)  u(1) = 2.

Proof. We have

u(t) = t-1 - t--1 = t--1(t2 - 1).

Since  > 0, we have u < 0 on (0, 1) and u > 0 on [1, ). This gives the result. Theorem 6 gives the precise value of SDD when  = +1. Theorem 8 below provides
a lower bound when  >  + 1.

Theorem 8 Let G be a graph with m edges, minimum degree  and maximum degree

 >  + 1. Denote by A0, A1, A2, the cardinality of the subsets of edges F0 = {uv  E(G) : du = , dv = }, F1 = {uv  E(G) : du = ,  < dv < }, F2 = {uv  E(G) : du = ,  < dv < }, respectively. If  > 0, then

3 Computational study of the variable symmetric division deg index on random graphs

Here we consider two models of random graphs G: Erd¨os-R´enyi (ER) graphs G(n, p) and bipartite random (BR) graphs G(n1, n2, p). ER graphs are formed by n vertices connected independently with probability p  [0, 1]. While BR graphs are composed by two disjoint sets, set 1 and set 2, with n1 and n2 vertices each such that there are no adjacent vertices within the same set, being n = n1 + n2 the total number of vertices in the bipartite graph. The vertices of the two sets are connected randomly with probability p  [0, 1].
We stress that the computational study of the variable symmetric division deg index we perform below is justified by the random nature of the graph models we want to explore. Since a given parameter set (n, p) [(n1, n2, p)] represents an infinite-size ensemble of ER graphs [BR graphs], the computation of SDD(G) on a single graph is irrelevant. In contrast, the computation of SDD(G) (where · indicates ensemble average) over a large number of random graphs, all characterized by the same parameter set (n, p) [(n1, n2, p)], may provide useful average information about the full ensemble. This computational approach, well known in random matrix theory studies, is not widespread in studies involving topological indices, mainly because topological indices are not commonly applied to random graphs; for very recent exceptions see [16­19].

3.1 Average properties of the SDD index on Erd¨os-R´enyi random graphs

From the definition of the variable symmetric division deg index, see Eq. (1), we have that:

(i) For  = 0, SDD0(G) gives twice the average number of edges of the ER graph.

That is,

SDD0(G) =

uvE(G)

d0u d0v

+

d0v d0u

=

(1 + 1)

uvE(G)

= 2|E(G)| = n(n - 1)p .

(2)

(ii) When np  1, we can approximate du  dv  d , then

SDD(G) 

(1 + 1) =

2

uvE(G)

uvE(G)

= 2|E(G)| = n(n - 1)p .

(3)

(iii) By recognizing that the average degree of the ER graph model reads as

d = (n - 1)p ,

(4)

we can rewrite Eq. (3) as

SDD(G) n



d

.

(5)

We stress that Eq. (5) is expected to be valid for np  1.

In Fig. 1(a) we plot SDD(G) as a function of the probability p of ER graphs of size n = 500. All averages in Fig. 1 are computed over ensembles of 107/n random graphs. In Fig. 1(a) we show curves for   [0, 4]. The dashed-magenta curve corresponds to the case  = 0, which coincides with Eq. (2). Moreover, we observe that

SDD0.5(G)  SDD0(G) = n(n - 1)p .

However, once  > 0.5, the curves SDD(G) versus p deviate from Eq. (2), at intermediate values of p, in the form of a bump which is enhanced the larger the value of  is. Also, in Fig. 1(a) we can clearly see that Eq. (3) is satisfied when np  1, as expected.
Now, in Fig. 1(b) we present SDD(G) as a function of the probability p of ER graphs of three different sizes. It is clear from this figure that the blocks of curves, characterized by the different graph sizes (and shown in different colors), display similar curves but displaced on both axes. Moreover, the fact that these blocks of curves, plotted in semi-log scale, are shifted the same amount on both x- and y-axis when doubling n make us anticipate the scaling of SDD(G) . We stress that other average variable degree-based indices on ER random graphs (normalized to the graph size) have been shown to scale with the average degree [19]. Indeed, this statement is encoded in Eq. (5), that we derived for np  1 but should serve as the global scaling equation for SDD(G) .
Therefore, in Fig. 1(c) we show SDD(G) /n as a function of the average degree d where the same curves of Fig. 1(b) have been used. There we verify the global scaling of SDD(G) , as anticipated in Eq. (5), by noticing that the blocks of curves (painted in different colors) for different graph sizes fall on top of each other.
Also, form Figs. 1(a-c) we observe that the inequality of Theorem 1 is extended to the average variable symmetric division deg index on random graphs:

SDD(G)  SDD(G) , 0 <  <  ;

(d-f) Equivalent figures to (a-c), respectively, but for bipartite random graphs composed by sets of equal sizes: in (d) n1 = n2 = 500 while in (e,f) n1 = n2 = {125, 250, 500}.

see e.g. the blue arrow in Fig. 1(a) which indicates increasing . Here, the equality is attained if and only if p = 1. However, we have observed that SDD(G)  SDD(G) already for d  10.

3.2 Average properties of the SDD index on bipartite random graphs

In Figs. 1(d,e) we present curves of the SDD(G) as a function of the probability p of BR graphs. For simplicity we show results for BR graphs composed by sets of equal sizes n1 = n2. In Fig. 1(d) we consider the case of n1 = n2 = 500 while in (e) we report n1 = n2 = {125, 250, 500}. In both figures we show curves for   [0, 4] in steps of 0.5.
Since edges in a bipartite graph join vertices of different sets, and we are labeling here the sets as set 1 and set 2, we replace du by d1 and dv by d2 in the expression for the SDD(G) index below. Thus,

(i) For  = 0, SDD0(G) gives twice the average number of edges of the BG graph. That is,

SDD0(G) =

E(G)

d02 d01

(iii) In the case we consider in Figs. 1(d-f), where n1 = n2 = n/2, so that d1 = d2 = d , Eq. (8) reduces to

SDD(G)



2|E(G)|

=

2n1n2p

=

n2 2

p

.

(9)

(iv) By recognizing that d = np/2 we can rewrite Eq. (9) as

SDD(G) n



d

.

(10)

We stress that Eq. (10) is expected to be valid for np  1. We also note that Eq. (10) has exactly the same form as Eq. (5).

From Figs. 1(d,e) we note that
SDD0.5(G)  SDD0(G) = 2n1n2p ,
see the dashed-magenta curve in Fig. 1(d). But once  > 0.5, the curves SDD(G) versus p deviate from Eq. (7), at intermediate values of p, in the form of bumps which are enhanced the larger the value of  is. These bumps make clear the validity of inequality (6) on BR graphs; see e.g. the blue arrow in Fig. 1(d) which indicates increasing .
Finally, following the scaling analysis made in the previous subsection for ER graphs, in Fig. 1(f) we plot the SDD(G) /n as a function of the average degree d where the same data sets of Fig. 1(e) have been used. Thus we verify that SDD(G) /n scales with d , as anticipated in Eq. (10); that is, the blocks of curves (painted in different colors) for different graph sizes coincide.
4 Conclusions
In this work we performed analytical and computational studies of the variable symmetric division deg index SDD(G). First, we provided a monotonicity property and obtained new inequalities connecting SDD(G) with other well­known topological indices such as the first and second variable Zagreb indices, the variable inverse sum deg index, as well as the the modified Narumi-Katayama index. Then, we apply the index SDD(G) on two ensembles of random graphs: Erdos-R´enyi graphs and bipartite random graphs. Thus, we computationally showed, for both random graph models, that the ratio SDD(G) /n is a function of the average degree d only (n being the order of the graph). We note that this last result, also observed for other variable topological indices [19], is valid for random bipartite graphs only when they are formed by sets of the same size.
