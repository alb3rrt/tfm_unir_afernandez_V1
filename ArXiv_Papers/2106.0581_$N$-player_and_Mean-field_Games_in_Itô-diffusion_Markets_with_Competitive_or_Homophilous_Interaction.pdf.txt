Abstract
The paper introduces and analyzes N -player and common-noise mean-field games in It^o-diffusion environments, in the context of both complete and incomplete financial markets. The players invest in a finite horizon and in a common market by either competitive or homophilous interactions. In both kinds of market environments, the players have individual risk tolerance coefficients. In the incomplete market setting, these risk tolerances are constants (CARA utilities), while in the complete market, they are assumed to be wealth-independent random variables depending, among others, on upcoming market information. For all these distinct models, we derive explicit or closed-form solutions for the optimal policies and optimal wealth processes, as well as for the related game values.
1 Introduction
The paper introduces N -player and common-noise mean-field games (MFG) in It^o-diffusion environments, in the context of optimal investment. It builds on the framework and notions of Lacker-Zariphopoulou [8] (see also [9]) but allows for general asset price processes beyond the log-normal class. It examines two families of It^o-diffusion markets, complete and incomplete, incorporates constant and random risk tolerances, and considers both the N -player and the MFG settings.
Market incompleteness stems from the stock coefficients being It^o-diffusions driven by a Brownian motion that is correlated to the one driving the stock price process. Under individual exponential utilities (CARA), we solve the N -player game when the players interact, driven either by competition or homophily, while investing in the common market. We derive the optimal policies and analyze them for both kinds of interacting behavior. We then introduce the common-noise MFG and solve for the optimal policies and their value. The associated minimal martingale measure, related auxiliary martingales, and their decomposition play a key role in the analysis.
In the complete common market case, we allow for random individual risk tolerance coefficients. For such preferences, we first analyze the single investor problem, which is interesting in its own right. The N player game becomes considerably more complex than its CARA analog, for the risk tolerance randomness essentially induces a "personalized" numeraire choice for each player. This, in turn, assigns an inherently "individual" market to each participant, and thus the tractability coming from the common market is substantially reduced. In the MFG setting, these new individual markets are randomly selected (depending on the type vector) and aggregate to a common market with a modified risk premium. We characterize the optimal policies and optimal wealth processes and values, building on the aforementioned single-player problem.
To our knowledge, N -player games and MFG in It^o-diffusion settings have not been considered before. Herein, we introduce such models under (individual) exponential preferences and analyze the associated problems building, from the one hand, on results from maximal expected utility problems in general markets and, from the other, employing the linear structure of the underlying controlled processes to study the aggregate problems.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we study the incomplete market case for both the N -player game and the MFG, and for CARA utilities. In Section 3, we focus on the complete

market case but allow for random risk tolerance coefficients. In analogy to Section 2, we analyze both the N -player game and the MFG. We make conclusive remarks in Section 4.

2 Incomplete Ito^-diffusion common market and CARA utilities
We consider an incomplete It^o-diffusion market, consisting of a riskless bond and a stock whose dynamics are driven by a correlated Brownian motion. We introduce the N -player and the mean-field game for players who invest in a finite horizon while interacting among them, driven either by competition or homophily. We further assume that the players (either at the finite or the continuum setting) have individual constant risk tolerance coefficients. For both the N -player and the MFG, we derive in closed form the optimal policies, optimal controlled processes, and the game values. The analysis uses the underlying minimal martingale measure, related martingales, and their decomposition.

2.1 The N -player game
Consider a probability space (, F , P) supporting two Brownian motions (Wt, WtY )t[0,T ], T < , imperfectly correlated with correlation coefficient   (-1, 1). We denote by (Ft)t[0,T ] the natural filtration generated by both W and W Y , and by (Gt)t[0,T ] the one generated only by W Y . We then let (µt)t[0,T ] and (t)t[0,t] to be Gt-adapted processes, with 0 < c  t  C and µt  C, t  [0, T ] , for some (possibly deterministic) constants c and C.
The financial market consists of a riskless bond (taken to be the numeraire and with zero interest rate) and a stock whose price process (St)t[0,T ] satisfies

dSt = µtSt dt + tSt dWt,

(2.1)

with the initial stock price S0 > 0. In this market, N players, indexed by i  I, I = {1, 2, . . . , N }, have investment horizon [0, T ] and trade
between the two accounts. Each player, say player i, uses a self-financing strategy (ti)t[0,T ], representing (discounted by the numeraire) the amount invested in the stock. Then, her wealth (Xti)t[0,T ] satisfies

dXti = ti (µt dt + t dWt) , X0i = xi  R,

(2.2)

with i being an admissible policy, element of the admissibility set,

T

A =  : self-financing, F-progressively measurable and EP

s2 ds <  .

0

(2.3)

As in [8] (see also [1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 15]), players optimize their terminal expected utility but are, also, concerned with the performance of their piers. For an arbitrary but fixed policy (1, . . . , i-1, i+1, . . . , N ), player i, i  I, seeks to optimize

X01 = x1, . . . , X0i = xi, . . . , X0N = xN , (2.4)
(2.5)

with XTj , j = 1, . . . , N , given by (2.2). The parameter i > 0 is the individual (absolute) risk tolerance while the constant ci  (-, 1] models
the individual interaction weight towards the average wealth of all players. If ci > 0, the above criterion models competition while when ci < 0 it models homophilous interaction (see, for example, [10]). The optimization criterion (2.4) can be, then, viewed as a stochastic differential game among the N players,
where the notion of optimality is being considered in the context of a Nash equilibrium as stated below
(see, for example, [2]).

From (2.7) and the martingale representation theorem, we deduce that there exists a Gt-adapted process t  L2 (P) such that

dMt = tMt dWtY = tMt  dWt + 1 - 2 dWt ,

(2.9)

where Wt is a standard Brownian motion independent of Wt appearing in the decomposition WtY = Wt + 1 - 2Wt.
In the absence of interaction among the players (ci  0, i  I), the optimization problem (2.4) has been analyzed by various authors (see, among others, [13, 14]). We recall its solution which will be frequently used herein.

Next, we present the first main result herein that yields the existence of a (wealth-independent) stochastic Nash equilibrium.

Proposition 2.3. For i > 0 and ci  (-, 1], introduce the quantities

1N N := N i
i=1

1N and N := N ci,
i=1

and The following assertions hold:

¯i

(2.18)

with

and

(Mt)t[0,T ]

as

in

(2.8).

2. If N = 1, then it must be that ci  1, for all i  I, and there is no such wealth-independent Nash equilibrium.

Proof. We first solve the individual optimization problem (2.4) for player i  I, taking the (arbitrary)

strategies (1, . . . , i-1, i+1, . . . , N ) of all the other players as given. Then, problem (2.4) can be alter-

natively written as

vi (x~i) = sup EP

solves

dx~it = ti (µt dt + t dWt) and x~i0 = x~i = xi - cix¯.

From Lemma 2.2, we deduce that the optimal policy for (2.19) is given by

ti, = i

t t

and thus the optimal policy of (2.4) can be written as

ti, = i

Symmetrically, all players j  I follow an analogous to (2.20) strategy. Averaging over j  I yields

and we obtain (2.16). The rest of the proof follows naturally.

We have stated the above result assuming that we start at t = 0. This is without loss of generality, as all arguments may be modified accordingly. For completeness, we will present the case t  (0, T ] in the sequel, when we present the example of a Markovian market.

H

in

that

-H(QM E |P)

ln M0

(cf. [13]). We choose to work with the QMM for ease of the presentation.

Remark 2.6. From Lemma 2.2, we see that the Nash equilibrium policy process,

ti, = ¯i

t t

+

1

 - 2

t t

resembles the optimal policy of an individual player of the classical optimal investment problem with modified risk tolerance, ¯i. The latter deviates from i by

¯i

-

i

=

1

N - N

ci.

In the competitive case, ci > 0, then ¯i > i and their difference increases with ci, N and N . At

times t such that

+ t

 t

t 1-2 t

> 0 (resp.

+ t

 t

t

1-2 t

 0), the competition concerns make the player to

invest more (resp. less) in the risky asset than without such concerns.

In the homophilous case, ci < 0, we have that ¯i < i. Furthermore, direct computations show that their

difference decreases with i and each cj, j = i, while it increases with ci. In other words,

j ¯i - i < 0, j  I, cj ¯i - i < 0, j  I {i} , ci ¯i - i > 0.

At

times

t

such

that

t t

+

 1-2

t t

>

0,

the

player

would

invest

less

in

the

risky

asset,

compared

to

without

homophilous interaction. This policy decreases if other players become more risk tolerant (their j s in-

crease) or less homophilous (their cj s increase) or if the specific player i becomes more homophilous (ci

decreases).

The

case

t t

+

 t 1-2 t

<0

follows

similarly.

The

between

the

and

the

homophilous case is described in Figure 1.

2.1.1 The Markovian case

We consider a single stochastic factor model in which the stock price process (St)t[0,T ] solves

dSt = µ(t, Yt)St dt + (t, Yt)St dWt, dYt = b(t, Yt) dt + a(t, Yt) dWtY ,

(2.23) (2.24)

with S0 = S > 0 and Y0 = y  R. The market coefficients µ, , a and b satisfy the appropriate conditions for these equations to have a unique strong solution. Further conditions, added next, are needed for the validity of the Feynman-Kac formula (see Proposition 2.8).

Assumption 2.7. It is assumed that µ, , a and b are bounded functions, and that a, b have bounded y-

derivatives.

It is further assumed that the Sharpe ration function (t, y) :=

µ(t,y) (t,y)

is bounded and with

bounded y-derivatives of any order.

For t  [0, T ] , we consider the optimization problem

V i(t, x1, . . . , xi, . . . , xN , y)

= sup EP
 i A

- exp

1 -
i

XTi - ciCT

Xt1 = x1, . . . , Xti = xi, . . . , XtN = xN , Yt = y , (2.25)

with (Xsi)s[t,T ] solving dXsi = µ(s, Ys)si ds + (s, Ys)si dWs and i  A, and CT as in (2.5). We consider the process (t)t[0,T ] with t := (t, Yt), where  : [0, T ] × R  R+ is given by

(t, y) = EQMM

e-

1 2

T t

Yt = y

.

Under QMM , the stochastic factor process (Yt)t[0,T ] satisfies

dYt = (b(t, Yt) - (t, Yt)a(t, Yt)) dt + a(t, Yt) dWtY .

Thus, using the conditions on the market coefficients and the Feynman-Kac formula we deduce that (t, y)

In the absence of competitive/homophilous interaction, this problem has been examined before (see, for example, [14]).

Proposition 2.8. Under Assumption 2.7, the following assertions hold for t  [0, T ] .

Proof. To ease the notation, we establish the results when t = 0 in (2.25). To this end, we first identify the process  in (2.8). For this, rewrite M as

(2.30) (2.31)

we

used

that

(t, y)

satisfies

(2.26).

Therefore,

t

=

a(t,

)

y (t,Yt)  (t,Yt )

.

In

turn,

using

(t, y)1/(1-2)

=

ef(t,y), we obtain that

fy(t, Yt)

=

1 1 - 2

y (t, y)  (t, y)

and

t = (1 - 2)a(t, Yt)fy(t, Yt),

and we easily conclude with replacing t by (1 - 2)a(t, Yt)fy(t, Yt) in (2.16). It remains to show that the candidate investment process in (2.28) is admissible. Under Assumption 2.7
we deduce that fy (t, y) is a bounded function, since  (t, y) is bounded away from zero and y (t, y) is bounded, which implies the conclusion.

Remark 2.9. In this Markovian model, the density of the minimal entropy measure is fully specified. Indeed, the BSDE (2.22) admits the solution

yt = f (t, Yt), Zt = a(t, Yt)fy(t, Yt) and Zt = 1 - 2a(t, Yt)fy(t, Yt),
and thus the density of the minimal entropy measure QME is given by (2.21) with t  (t, Yt) = - 1 - 2a(t, Yt)fy(t, Yt).

are

the

and

thus

its

solution

f (t, y) is independent of the parameter . Using the ansatz f (t, y) = p(t)y + q(t) with p(T ) = q(T ) = 0,

we deduce from (2.27) that p(t) and q(t) satisfy

2.2 The common-noise MFG

We analyze the limit as N   of the N -player game studied in Section 2.1. We first give an intuitive and informal argument that leads to a candidate optimal strategy in the mean-field setting, and then propose a rigorous formulation for the MFG. The analysis follows closely the arguments developed in [8].
For the N -player game, we denote by i = (xi, i, ci) the type vector for player i, where xi is her initial wealth, and i and ci are her risk tolerance coefficient and interaction parameter, respectively. Such type vectors induce an empirical measure mN , called the type distribution,

1N mN (A) = N 1i (A), for Borel sets A  Z,
i=1

which is a probability measure on the space Z := R × (0, ) × (-, 1].

We recall (cf. (2.16)) that the equilibrium strategies (ti,)t[0,T ], i  I, are given as the product of the

common

(type-independent)

process

t t

+

 1-2

t t

and

the

modified

risk

tolerance

parameter

¯i

=

i

+

N 1-N

ci.

Therefore, it is only the coefficient ¯i that depends on the empirical distribution mN through N and N ,

as both these quantities can be obtained by averaging appropriate functions over mN . Therefore, if we

assume that mN converges weakly to some limiting probability measure as N  , we should intuitively

expect that the corresponding equilibrium strategies also converge. This is possible, for instance, by letting

the type vector  = (x, , c) be a random variable in the space Z with limiting distribution m, and take i

as i.i.d. samples of . The sample i is drawn and assigned to player i at initial time t = 0. We would then expect (i,)t[0,T ] to converge to the process

(2.33)

where c¯ and ¯ represent the average interaction and risk tolerance coefficients. Next, we introduce the mean-field game in the incomplete It^o-diffusion market herein, and we show that
(2.33) indeed arises as its equilibrium strategy. We model a single representative player, whose type vector is a random variable with distribution m, and all players in the continuum act in this common incomplete It^o-diffusion market. To our knowledge, MFG in It^o-diffusion environments have not been studied before.

2.2.1 The It^o-diffusion common-noise MFG To describe the heterogeneous population of players, we introduce the type vector

 = (x, , c)  Z,

(2.34)

where  > 0 and c  (-, 1] represent the risk aversion coefficient and interaction parameter, and x is the initial wealth. This type vector is assumed to be independent of both W and W Y , which drive the stock
price process (2.1), and is assumed to have finite second moments.
To formulate the mean-field portfolio game, we consider a filtered probability space (, F, P) supporting W, W Y and . We denote by (FtMF )t[0,T ] the smallest filtration satisfying the usual assumptions for which  is F0MF -measurable and both W, W Y are adapted. As before, we denote by (Ft)t[0,T ] the natural filtration generated by W and W Y , and by (Gt)t[0,T ] the one generated only by W Y .

9

We also consider the wealth process (Xt)t[0,T ] of the representative player solving

with X0 = x  R and   AMF ,

dXt = t (µtdt + tdWt) ,

AMF =  : self-financing, FtMF -progressively measurable and EP

T
s2 ds <  .
0

(2.35)

Similarly to the framework in [8], there exist two independent sources of randomness in the model: the first is due to the evolution of the stock price process, described by the Brownian motions W and W Y . The second is given by , which models the type of the player, i.e., the triplet of initial wealth, risk tolerance, and interaction parameter in the population continuum. The first source of noise is stochastic and common to each player in the continuum while the second one is static, being assigned at time zero and with the dynamic competition starting right afterward.
In analogy to the N -player setting, the representative player optimizes the terminal expected utility, taking into account the performance of the average terminal wealth of the population, denoted by X¯ . As in [8], we introduce the following definition for the MFG considered here.
Definition 2.10. For each   AMF , let X := EP[XT |FT ] with (Xt)t[0,T ] solving (2.35), and consider the optimization problem

A strategy   AMF is a mean-field equilibrium, if  is the optimal strategy of the above problem when X := EP[XT |FT ] with (Xt)t[0,T ] solving (2.35) with  being used.
Next, we state the main result.

Proposition 2.11. If EP[c] < 1, there exists a unique wealth-independent MFG equilibrium (t)t[0,T ], given by the F0MF  Gt process

t =

c  + 1 - EP[c] EP[]

(2.38)

and

V (x) = - exp

and

m = EP[x].

If EP[c] = 1, there is no such equilibrium.

Proof. We first observe that t in (2.37) is FtMF -measurable since

t is also square-integrable under standing assumptions, thus admissible. To show t in (2.37) is indeed an equilibrium, we shall first define X using t, and then verify that
the optimal strategy to the representative player's problem (2.36) coincide with t when this specific X is

10

used in (2.36). To this end, we introduce the process Xt := EP[Xt|Ft] where (Xt)t[0,T ] as in (2.38):

2.2.2 The Markovian case

In analogy to the N -player case, we have the following results.

Proposition 2.12. Assume that the stock price follows the single factor model (2.23) and (2.24). Then, if
EP [c] < 1, there exists a unique wealth-independent Markovian mean-field game equilibrium, given by the process (t)t[0,T ] ,

t = (, t, Yt) =

If c¯ = 1, there is no such mean-field game equilibrium.

3 Complete It^o-diffusion common market and CARA utilities with random risk tolerance coefficients
In this section, we focus on the complete common market case, but we extend the model by allowing random individual risk tolerance coefficients. We start with background results for the single-player problem, which is interesting in its own right. Building on these results, we analyze both the N -player and the MFG. The analysis shows that the randomness of the individual risk tolerance gives rise to virtual "personalized" markets, in that the original common risk premium process now differs across players, depending on their risk tolerance. This brings substantial complexity as the tractability coming from the original common market is now lost.

3.1 The Ito^-diffusion market and random risk tolerance coefficients

We consider the complete analog of the It^o-diffusion market studied in Section 2. Specifically, we consider

a market with a riskless bond (taken to be the numeraire and offering zero interest rate) and a stock whose

price process (St)t[0,T ] solves

dSt = St (µtdt + tdWt) ,

with the initial price S0 > 0, and (Wt)t[0,T ] being a Brownian motion in a probability space (, F , P). The market coefficients (µt)t[0,T ] and (t)t[0,T ] are Ft-adapted processes, where (Ft)t[0,T ] is the natural filtration generated by W , with 0 < c  t  C, and µt  C, t  [0, T ] for some (possibly deterministic) constants c and C.
In this market, N players, indexed by i  I, I = {1, 2, . . . , N }, trade between the two accounts in [0, T ], with individual wealths Xti t[0,T ] solving

dXti = ti (µt dt + t dWt) ,

(3.1)

and X0i = xi  R. Each player, say player i, has random risk tolerance, Ti , defined on (, F , P) with the following prop-
erties:

Assumption 3.1. For each i  I, the risk tolerance Ti is an FT -measurable random variable with Ti   > 0 and EP Ti 2 < .
The objective of each player is to optimize

V i (x1, . . . , xi, . . . , xN )

with ci  (-, 1], Xj, j  I, solving (3.1), and A defined similarly to (2.3). As in Section 2.1, we are interested in a Nash equilibrium solution, which is defined as in Definition 2.1.
Before we solve the underlying stochastic N -player game, we study the single-player case. This is a problem interesting on its own right and, to our knowledge, has not been studied before in such markets. A similar problem was considered in a single-period binomial model in [11] and a special diffusion case in [12] in the context of indifference pricing of bonds. For generality, we present below the time-dependent case.

3.2.1 The Markovian case
We assume that the stock price process (St)t[0,T ] solves
dSt = µ(t, St)Stdt + (t, St)StdWt,
with the initial price S0 > 0, and the functions µ(t, St) and (t, St) satisfying appropriate conditions, similar to the ones in Subsection 2.1.1 and Assumption 2.7. The risk tolerance is assumed to have the functional representation
T = (ST ), for some function  : R+  R+ bounded from below and such that EP 2(ST ) < , (cf. Assumption 3.1).

3.3 N -player game

We study the N -player game in this subsection. The concepts and various quantities are in direct analogy to those in Section 2, and thus we omit various intermediate steps and only focus on the new elements coming from the randomness of the risk tolerance coefficients.

Proposition 3.3. For i  I, let

3.4 The common-noise MFG

Let (, F, P) be a probability space that supports the Brownian motion W as well as the random type vector
 = (x, T , c),
which is independent of W . As before, we denote by (Ft)t[0,T ] the natural filtration generated by W , and (FtMF )t[0,T ] with FtMF = Ft  (). In the mean-field setting, we model the representative player. One may also think of a continuum of players whose initial wealth x and the interaction parameter c are random, chosen at initial time 0. Their risk tolerance coefficients have two sources of randomness, related to their form and their terminal measurability, respectively. Specifically, at initial time 0, it is determined how these coefficients will depend on the final information, which is however provided only at final time T . For example, in the Markovian case, this amounts to pinning down at time 0 the functional form of (·) and, in turn, the risk tolerance used for utility maximization is given by the random variable (ST ), which depends on the information FT through ST .
Similarly to (3.2), we are concerned with the optimization problem

V (x) = sup EP
AM F

- exp

1 -
T

XT - cX

F0MF , X0 = x ,

and the definition of the mean-field game is analogous to Definition 2.10. Let (t)t[0,T ] and (t)t[0,T ] be given by

(3.20)

t = EQ[T |FtMF ] and dt = ttdWtQ,

(3.21)

with Q defined on FTMF by (3.4). The process (t)t[0,T ] may be interpreted as the arbitrage-free price of the risk tolerance "claim" T for this representative player. Let also Q defined on FTMF by

For the proof, we will need the following lemma.
Lemma 3.5. If X is a FsMF -measurable integrable random variable, then EP[X|Ft] = EP[X|Fs], for s  [0, t].

Proof. Let P := {A = C  D : C  Fs, D  {Wu - Ws, s  u  t}} and L = {A  F : EP[X1A] = EP[EP[X|Fs]1A]}. Then the following assertions hold:
(1) P is a -system since both Fs and {Wu - Ws, s  u  t} are -algebras and closed under intersection. Also Fs  P and {Wu - Ws, s  u  t}  P by taking D =  and C = .
(2) P  L. For any A  P, A = C  D with C  Fs, D  {Wu - Ws, s  u  t}, it holds that

EP[EP[X|Fs]1A] = EP[EP[X|Fs]1C 1D] = EP[EP[X1C |Fs]1D] = EP[X1C ]EP[1D],

where we have consecutively used that C  D, the metastability of 1C, and the independence between 1D and Fs.
By the independence between 1D and FsMF = Ft  (), we deduce
EP[X1A] = EP[X1C 1D] = EP[X1C ]EP[1D],

and conclude that A  L. Therefore P  L.

(3) L is a -system. It is obvious that   L and A  L imply that Ac  L. For a sequence of disjoint

sets A1, A2, . . . in L, one has X1 i=1Ai  |X| and, thus, by the dominated convergence theorem, we deduce that


EP[X 1 i=1Ai ] =

EP[X1Ai ].

i=1

(3.23)

Similarly, by the inequalities EP[X|Fs]1 i=1Ai 1  EP[X|Fs] 1  X 1, we have


EP[EP[X|Fs]1 i=1Ai ] = EP[EP[X|Fs]1Ai ].
i=1

(3.24)

Since Ai  L, i, the right-hand-sides of (3.23) and (3.24) are equal, which implies  i=1Ai  L. Therefore, by the - theorem, we obtain that Ft = (Fs  {Wu - Ws, s  u  t})  (P)  L.
Noticing that EP[X|Fs] is Ft-measurable by definition, we have that EP[X|Ft] = EP[X|Fs].

and a similar derivation for EP[ t(t + t)| Ft]. We conclude by having the admissibility of  given by the model assumptions, the formula of , and equation (3.4).

4 Conclusion and future research directions
We have introduced and studied N -player and mean-field games in It^o-diffusion markets. We analyzed the optimal policies, wealth processes, and the game values using results from maximal expected utility problems for complete and incomplete such general markets. Herein, we focused on exponential-type utilities, but similar results may be derived for the case of (individual) power utilities, provided the criteria that model interaction are suitably modified so that certain scaling properties hold (see, for example, [8] and [9] for the log-normal case). The calculations are tedious but straightforward, and we omit them for brevity. The case of more general utility processes (beyond homothetic ones) presents several challenges due to throughout non-linear wealth dependence. On the other hand, there is a substantial volume of results from maximal expected utility problems in semi-martingale markets, which could offer valuable insights when extended to multi-player and MFG settings. The authors are currently working in this direction. Finally, our results may be used to study similar questions when the dynamics of the common market and/or the individual preferences are not entirely known. This would, for example, extend the analysis to various problems in reinforcement learning (see, for example, the recent work [10] in a static setting).
