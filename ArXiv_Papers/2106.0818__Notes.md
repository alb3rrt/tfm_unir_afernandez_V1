## Abstract

Motivated by the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, we therefore suggest to impose an orthogonality constraint on the stochastic force, which is in fact equivalent to the validity of this Volterra equation. Such GLEs automatically satisfy the second FDT and are unique, which is desirable when using GLEs for coarse-grained modeling.
