## Abstract

By controlling quantum fluctuations via the Falk-Bruch inequality we give the first rigorous argument for the existence of a spin-glass phase in the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with a transverse magnetic field if the temperature and the field are sufficiently low. The argument also applies to the generalization of the model with multi-spin interactions, sometimes dubbed as transverse $p$-spin model.
