The pinning phenomena of the domain wall in the presence of exchange bias is studied analytically. The analytic solution of the domain wall spin configuration is presented. Unlike the traditional solution which is symmetric, our new solution could exhibit the asymmetry of the domain wall spin profile. Using the solution, the domain wall position, its width, its stability, and the depinning field are discussed analytically.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetic recording has been the most successful method for data storage in the last few decades. In 2008, Parkin et.al. proposed a racetrack memory which has all the advantages of magnetoresistance random access memory (MRAM) and all metallic semiconductor free structure [1]. Racetrack memory consists of an ferromagnetic wire where a magnetic domain wall (DW) can be injected and detected. A 1800 transverse DW carries a data bit via its configuration of either north to north or south to south poles. Several directions were also proposed to apply nanofabrication techniques to geometrically control the DW width and shape [2]. Artificially induced defects could be used as pinning sites, while nanopatterned structures provide modification of the DW configuration, size and dynamical properties [3].
Recently, it was found that the pinning site, e.g., notch, may generate topological defect and then change the chirality and topological properties of DW structure. The chirality of DW will affect its trajectory in the Y-shape wire [4, 5]. The topological defect pinning may not be a good option for data storage.
Another option is making use of the exchange bias effect to pin the DW in ferromagnetic material, which could be more stable and smaller in size. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the DW is generated in ferromagnetic (F) wire [6]. The pinning is controlled through the exchange bias induced by the antiferromagnetic (AF) wire. Its possibility was recently realized in experiments [7] and simulation [8]. However, its theoretical understanding is still lacking.
In extreme condition, without the magnetostatic and surface energies, only the anisotropy and exchange energies are considered, the spin orientation near the domain wall [9, 10] reads

describing a head-to-head Block wall in x-direction with the spin angle (x) [11].  = Aex/K with the exchange stiffness Aex and the anisotropy constant K along x-axis. This formula gives the domain wall width DW   and

 energy density DW = 4 AexK.
For thin magnetic nanowires, since the shape anisotropy is mainly determined by the thickness and width of the nanowires, the anisotropy should be perpendicular or in-plane [12, 13]. In this paper, only the in-plane case is considered for simplicity. The analytic solution of the domain wall profile is obtained. With the help of the analytic solution, the relationship between spin orientation and the length scales of the domain wall is derived. The position of domain wall, its width, its stability are also discussed.

Domain wall region is identified by grey dashed lines. The exchange bias field HebL in the left and HebR in the right are oriented at opposite directions.
MODEL FOR NON-UNIFORM EXCHANGE BIAS
In ferromagnetic material, two magnetic atoms interact with the so-called exchange interaction, JS1 · S2. J is the exchange constant, and S1, S2 are magnetic moments of two atoms. In one dimensional wire and continuum

2

limit, suppose the atoms only interact with their nearest neighbors and the direction of magnetization varies slowly along the wire, the energy, which we call the exchange energy Eex, is

+

(2)

up to a constant. Aex which is proportional to J is called the exchange constant. (x) is the orientation of the magnetization at position x.
If we further consider the coupling between the ferromagnetic material and another antiferromagnet, an unidirectional anisotropy would be induced in the ferromagnetic material, which is usually referred to exchange bias [14]. The corresponding exchange bias energy density could be modeled by

eb = -Keb cos((x) - eb)

(3)

where Keb is called the unidirectional exchange coupling constant. eb is the angle between the magnetic moment and unidirectional anisotropy axes.
In our system, as illustrated in Fig.1, besides the exchange energy of F wire, there is also the exchange bias energy Eeb due to the coupling between the F and AF wires. At the interface between F and AF wires, the exchange anisotropy effect could create the domain wall in F wire. As shown in Fig.1, in the left (right) hand side of F wire, the magnetization points to the right (left) due to the coupling from AF wire. Hence

eb =

0 if x < 0  if x > 0

(4)

and Keb are also different in the left and right sides. If we define the exchange bias field Heb such that its magnitude Heb = Keb/Ms, where Ms is the saturation
magnetization of F wire. The direction of Heb is along the unidirectional anisotropy axes. It follows that

Heb =

HebL e^x if x < 0 -HebR e^x if x > 0

(5)

where HebL and HebR are the exchange bias field intensities in the left and right regions, respectively. Domain wall width from 150 nm to 1 µm range can be obtained at the boundary between two regions with opposite exchange bias field ranging from 50 to 300 Oe. These exchange bias values are compatible with those found in the Fe40Co40B20/Ir20Mn80 or Py/Ir20Mn80 systems [15].

Eq.(3) can then be re-written as

eb = -M · Heb

(6)

where M = Ms(e^x cos (x) + e^y sin (x)). It turns out that the exchange bias energy

where L =

2Aex/(MsHebL) and R =

2Aex/(MsHebR) define the length scales of the

domain wall in the left and right regions, respectively.

Here we obtained a formula different from the traditional

one used in micromagnetics as shown in Eq.(1). The

traditional formula is applied for head-to-head Block

wall whereas it is the Neel wall in our case. The spin

orientation at x = 0, 0, is determined by the continuity of its derivatives, i.e., (x = 0-) = (x = 0+), which

gives

0 = 2 tan-1

(15)

If the bias field is symmetric, i.e., HebL = HebR, then L = R, 0 = /2, and obviously the DW center xc = 0 by symmetry. In general, the bias field is not neccssary to be symmetric, i.e., HebL = HebR, the DW width becomes DW = (L + R)/2 [16]. The DW center, xc, defined as the position such that (xc) = /2, can be found by using Eqs.(14)-(15), which gives

If the lowest order is kept, the expression can be simplified as

(R

(17)

for |L - R|  L and |L - R|  R. This serves as a useful formula for fast estimation of the domain wall center position. The spin orientation (x) along the F wire for different bias is shown in Fig.2. It can be seen that as bias field asymmetry increases, the domain wall becomes wider, and the domain wall center will shift to the direction of lower bias. It implies that one can fine-tune the DW position and modifies the DW width

through exchange bias. To quantify their changes, let the

dimensional parameter h =

HebL -HebR HebL +HebR

to represent the

degree of asymmetry bias. The DW width and the center

position can then be re-written as

DW

(19)

The plots of their relations with h are shown in Fig.3.
If an external magnetic field Hext = Hexte^x is applied along the F wire, the bias asymmetry is modified, and so
it turns out to be described by an effective exchange bias field Heebff which is the sum of Heb from Eq.(5) and Hext, i.e.,

Heebff =

(HebL + Hext) e^x if x < 0 (-HebR + Hext) e^x if x > 0

(20)

When the applied field Hext approaches to exchange

bias in the right region, HebR, the corresponding DW width in the right, which is described by the length scale
2Aex/(Ms(HebR - Hext)), will diverge. Physically it implies the domain wall becomes unstable. Such a critical external field

Hc = HebR

(21)

should correspond to the depinning field with the same order of magnitude. It is consistent with the experimental observation that the wider AF wires, the larger

4

(x) (deg) DW x c

exchange bias, and hence the larger depinning field [7]. The variation of Eeb is justified in polycrystalline ex-
change bias systems characterized by large antiferromagnetic uniaxial anisotropy [17]. In Fe40Co40B20/Ir20Mn80 system, the typical values of saturation magnetization Ms = 750 kA/m, exchange stiffness Aex = 1.2 × 10-11J/m, If Heb is 175 Oe, then H  42.8 nm. The unidirectional anisotropy constant Keb = 6.56 kJ/m3. then the domain width DW  H = 134 nm. The energy density is DW  4 AexKeb/2  1.12 mJ/m2.
Except the exchange energy and the exchange bias energy, there are other types of interaction involved in reality, for example, the dipolar interaction which is of at least one order lower [18]. The shape anisotropy constant Ksh = µ0MS2/2 = 0.35 MJ/m3 due to demagnetizing energy is much larger than the unidirectional anisotropy Eeb = 6.56 kJ/m3 due to exchange bias energy. Although Ksh much large Keb, in the nano thin, narrow strips, the strong demagnetizing field force the magnetization vector parallel to the plane of thin, narrow strips, so that the exchange bias acts as a slight modulation. This peculiar asymmetric configuration can be obtained experimentally by ion irradiation techniques, by modulating the ions dose for selectively destroying or weaken the exchange coupling between the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic layers and therefore the exchange bias has asymmetry [19, 20].

UNIAXIAL ANISOTROPY

In this section, we study the effect of in-plane uniaxial anisotropy on the DW structure, its stability and the depinning field in the one-dimensional wire in the presence of exchange bias.

The in-plane anisotropy should play an important role in determining the domain wall structure and also its

width. In particular, the domain wall width decreases

In the following, the symmetric bias (HebL = HebR = effect. Since no closed form solution of the above differHeb) is assumed in order to understand the anisotropic ential equation is found, we adopt the solution form in

5

Eq.(14) for the case that the anisotropy energy is small compared with the exchange bias energy, i.e., Kani  MsHeb. The domain wall length scale L = R =  is

left as the variational parameter. The total energy becomes

To compare with the simulation result [8], we set the

same values of Kani as used in simulation. The spin ori-

entation (x) for different Heb/Kani is shown in Fig.4. It

shows that the larger anisotropy, the larger DW width.

The domain wall length scale  (same order of magnitude

as domain wall width) as a function of Heb for different

anisotropies is shown in Fig.5. It can be seen that the

difference in DW width for different anisotropies is in-

significant if the exchange bias is large enough. It implies

that for large exchange bias, the structure of DW would

be slightly modified by anisotropy effect. Our result is

consistent with simulation from which the same plot is

shown in Fig.4(a) in Ref.[8].

If the anisotropy effect takes place along y-axis, once Kani > MsHeb, the domain wall width is sufficiently large such that the boundary conidtion imposed in Eq.(12) be-

comes invalid.

If the external magnetic field Hext = Hexte^x is applied,

similar to the case in previous section, we could replace

Heb by the effective one, i.e., Heebff = -Heb + Hext in the right side. The solution in Eq.(14) becomes physically

unstable when the DW length scale, , in Eq.(26), di-

verges. At this moment, Heebff = -Hc + Hext. It defines the critical field

CONCLUSION
We solve analytically for the spin orientation along the wire in the presence of non-uniform exchange bias [8], as shown in Eq.(14). Even for symmetry exchange bias field, the solution we get is different from the traditional

one, as shown in Eq.(1), usually appeared in the field of micromagnetics [9].
For asymmetry exchange bias field, the spin orientation 0, and the center position of the domain wall xc as a function domain wall length scales R and R are also derived analytically. These variables can be easily measured in experiments and hence it could be verified in practise. Finally, with small anisotropic effect, the domain wall stability condition and the depinning field are

6

also obtained. Although the model is so simplified that only the ex-
change bias, the exchange energy, and the anisotropy effect are considered, and the other contribution from dipolar interaction, the imperfect and edges energy, which are at least one order lower [18], are ignored, our analytic results are still consistent with previous simulation [8]. The creation and fine tuning of the domain wall by exchange bias and uniaxial anisoropy are shown to be possible. These results should be helpful for the development of new DW-based magnetic devices and architectures.
