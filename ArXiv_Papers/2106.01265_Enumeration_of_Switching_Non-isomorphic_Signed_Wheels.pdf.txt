Abstract. Two signed graphs are called switching isomorphic to each other if one is isomorphic to a switching of the other. The wheel Wn is the join of the cycle Cn and a vertex. For 0  p  n, p(n) is defined to be the number of switching non-isomorphic signed Wn with exactly p negative edges on Cn. The number of switching non-isomorphic signed Wn is denoted by (n). In this paper, we compute the values of p(n) for p = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, n - 4, n - 3, n - 2, n - 1, n and of (n) for n = 4, 5, ..., 10. Keywords: signed wheel; switching isomorphism; switching isomorphism.
1 Introduction
A signed graph, denoted by  = (G, ), is a graph consisting of an ordinary graph G and a sign function  : E(G)  {+1, -1} which labels each edge of G as positive or negative. In  = (G, ), G is called the underlying graph of  and the set -1(-1) = {e  E(G) | (e) = -1} is called the signature of . Switching  by a vertex u changes the sign of each edge incident to u. Two signed graph 1 = (G, 1) and 2 = (G, 2) are called switching equivalent if one can be obtained by a sequence of switchings from the other.
The following characterization of two signed graphs to be switching equivalent is given by Zaslavsky [5].

Lemma 1.1. [5] Two signed graphs 1, 2 are switching equivalent if and only if they have the same set of negative cycles.

Given a graph G on n vertices and m edges, there are 2m ways of constructing signed graphs on G. An elementary proof of the following lemma is given in [1, Lemma 2.1].

Lemma 1.2. There are 2m-n+1 switching non-equivalent signed graphs on a connected graph G on n vertices and m edges.

We say the signed graphs 1 = (G, 1) and 2 = (H, 2) are isomorphic if there exists a graph

isomorphism between G and H preserving the edge signs. Two signed graphs are switching isomorphic

if one is isomorphic to a switching of the other. Two signed graphs (G, 1) and (H, 2) are automorphic

if they are isomorphic to each other and G = H.

Up to switching isomorphism, it is known that there are two signed K3, three signed K4, and seven signed K5. In [3], the authors classified all sixteen switching non-isomorphic signed K6. Mallows and

Sloane [2] proved that the number of switching non-isomorphic signed complete graphs on n vertices is

equal to the number of Euler graphs on n vertices. In [5], Zaslavsky proved that there are only six signed

Petersen graphs, up to switching isomorphism.

Recently, Y. Bagheri et al. [1] proved that the number of mutually switching non-isomorphic signed

graphs associated with a given graph G is equal to the number of orbits of the automorphism group of

G acting on the set of all possible signed graphs with underlying graph G. In this paper, we have used a

different technique to determine the number of switching non-isomorphic signed wheels of some particular

orders.

A wheel, denoted by Wn, is the join of the cycle Cn and a vertex. Let V (Wn) = {v, v1, v2, ..., vn} and

E(Wn) = {vvi, vivi+1 | i = 1, 2, ..., n}, where the subscripts are read modulo n. For 1  i  n, the edges

vvi are said to be the spokes of Wn, and the cycle induced by edges vivi+1 is said to be the outer cycle,

denoted by Cn, of Wn.

For n = 3, the graph W3 is the complete graph K4. It is known that the number of switching nonisomorphic signed graphs over K4 is 3. Thus, in the subsequent discussion, we consider the wheels Wn

for n  4.

For a fixed 0  p  n, p(n) denotes the number of switching non-isomorphic signed wheels with

exactly p negative edges on Cn. By (n), we denote the number of switching non-isomorphic signed

wheels. Thus, (n) =

n p=0

p(n).

The values of p(n) for p = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, n - 4, n - 3, n - 2, n - 1, n are determined in Section 3. Using

these values, the values of (n) for n  10 are obtained in Section 4.

2 Terminology and Methodology

Our approach to enumerate the switching non-isomorphic signed wheels is to put p negative edges on Cn

at different distances that generate all mutually switching non-isomorphic signed wheels.

By Gn, we denote a regular n-gon having vertex set V (Gn) = {v1, v2, v3, ..., vn} and edge set E(Gn) =

{vivi+1 | i = 1, 2, ..., n}, where the subscripts are read modulo n.

The distance between two vertices u and v, denoted d(u, v), in a graph G is defined to be the number

of edges in a shortest path between u and v.

In

Gn,

it

is

clear

that

1



d(vi, vj)





n 2



for

all

i

=

j.

Further, if we measure the distance along one particular direction (in clockwise or anticlockwise), then

we have 1  d(vi, vj)  n - 1 for all i = j.

If

n

is

an

even

number

then

the

vertices

vi

and

vi+

n 2

are

called

diagonally

opposite

vertices

and

the

edges

vivi+1

and

vi+

n 2

vi+1+

n 2

are called

the

opposite

edges.

On

the

other hand,

if

n

is

an

odd

number,

for

any

vi,

the

edge

vi+

n 2



vi+(

n 2

+1)

is

called

the

opposite

edge

of

vi,

1



i



n.

Clearly, Gn features n axes of symmetry. A common point at which all these axes meet is called the

center of Gn. Observe that if n is an even number then half of the axes pass through diagonally opposite

vertices and the remaining axes pass through the midpoints of opposite edges. On the other hand, if n

is an odd number, all the axes pass through a vertex and the midpoint of its opposite edge.

Let Aut(G) denotes the automorphism group of a graph G. It is well known that Aut(Wn) = Aut(Gn) = < ,  | n = 2 = 1,  = -1 >, the dihedral group Dn.

If a spoke vvj, for some 1  j  n, is negative in (Wn, ) then one can make it positive by switching by vj. Thus for any (Wn, ) there is an equivalent (Wn, 1) such that 1-1(-1)  E(Cn). Therefore, in the subsequent discussion, we only consider the signed wheels whose negative edges lie on Cn.

The following result will be helpful to examine whether two signed wheels are switching equivalent.

Lemma 2.1. Two signed wheels with different signatures are always switching non-equivalent.
Proof. Let 1 = (Wn, 1) and 2 = (Wn, 2) be two signed wheels such that 1-1(-1) = 2-1(-1). Since each negative edge makes exactly one triangle negative, the result follows directly from Lemma 1.1.

Let  = (Wn, ) be a signed wheel with p negative edges. Corresponding to , we associate an

Example 2.1. Consider  = (W8, ), as depicted in Figure 1. Let e1 = v1v2, e2 = v2v3, e3 = v4v5, e4 = v7v8 so that -1(-1) = {e1, e2, e3, e4}. It is easy to see that d(e1, e2) = 0, d(e1, e3) = 2, d(e1, e4) = 1, d(e2, e3) = 1, dist(e2, e4) = 2, d(e3, e4) = 2. Therefore, r0 = 1, r1 = 2, r2 = 3, r3 = 0, r4 = 0. Hence we have D() = (1, 2, 3, 0, 0).

The following lemma will help us in deciding whether two signed wheels with p negative edges are automorphic.

Lemma 2.2. Two signed wheels 1 and 2 with p negative edges are automorphic to each other if and only if D(1) = D(2).

Proof. Let 1 and 2 be automorphic to each other. Since an automorphism of Wn preserve the distance,

it follows that D(1) = D(2).

Conversely, let 1 and 2 be two signed wheels with p negative edges such that D(1) = D(2). We

need to show that 1 and 2 are automorphic to each other. To establish an automorphism of Wn

that maps 1 onto 2, we first fix the position of p negative edges of 1 in clockwise direction, say, at

v11 v11+1, v12 v12+1, v13 v13+1, ..., v1p v1p+1 such that 1  1i < 1j  n for 1  i < j  p. Since D(1) = D(2), the positions of p negative edges of 2 can also be fixed in clockwise direction

say, at v21 v21+1, v22 v22+1, v23 v23+1, ..., v2p v2p+1, where 1  2i  n and subscripts are read modulo n, so that

d(v1i v1i+1, v1j v1j+1) = d(v2i v2i+1, v2j v2j+1), for all i, j  {1, 2, ..., p}.

(1)

Define  : V (Wn)  V (Wn) by

 v (x) = v21 +t

if x = v if x = v11+t for t = 0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1.

It is easy to verify that  is an automorphism of Wn that maps 1 onto 2. Hence if D(1) = D(2)

then 1 and 2 are automorphic to each other.

Lemma 2.1 and Lemma 2.2 together yields the following result.

Lemma 2.3. Let 1 and 2 be two signed wheels with p negative edges such that D(1) = D(2). Then 1 and 2 are switching non-isomorphic.

Lemma 2.4. Among any four edges e1, e2, e3 and e4 of Cn, there exist two edges ei and ej such that

d(ei,

Proof. For a fix n, let if possible

Note that if the distance between ei and ej is k then there are at least k - 1 vertices between end vertices

ej .

Therefore

there

This

means

there

Cn,

a

contradiction.

Hence

the

result

follows.

Let e1, e2, e3 and e4 be four negative edges which lie on Cn. We place the edges e1, e2, e3 and e4 in

such a way that if i < j and ei = vrvr+1, ej = vlvl+1 then r + 1  l. Further, in light of Lemma 2.4, we

can

always

assume

that

d(e1, e2)





n-4 4

.

Without loss of generality, let e1 = v1v2.

To calculate the

value of 4(n), we will count the different signatures of size four by applying the following strategies.

S1. Take d(e1, e2) = 0 and count the different possibilities for e3 and e4 up to automorphisms. This is carried out in Lemma 3.5, Lemma 3.6, Lemma 3.7 and Lemma 3.8.

S2. Take d(e1, e2) = 1 and count the choices for e3 and e4 under the following conditions: (i) d(e2, e3)  1; (ii) d(e3, e4)  1; (iii) d(e4, e1)  1. Note that if any one of d(e2, e3), d(e3, e4), d(e4, e1) is zero then replacement of those two edges with e1 and e2 will give us a signature which is already encountered in S1.

S3.

For d(e1, e2) = r, where

count

different choices

of e3

and

e4.

S4.

If

d(e1, e2)

= r + 1,

where

n-4 4

,

count

the

different

choices

for

e3

and

e4

under

the

following conditions:

(i) d(e2, e3)  r + 1; (ii) d(e3, e4)  r + 1; (iii) d(e4, e1)  r + 1. Note that if any one of d(e2, e3), d(e3, e4), d(e4, e1) is less than r + 1 then replacement of those two edges with e1 and e2 will give us a signature which is already encountered in S3.

3 Computation
In this section, we compute the value of p(n) for p = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, n - 4, n - 3, n - 2, n - 1, and n, where n  4. To count the number of switching non-isomorphic signed wheels with p negative edges, it is enough
5

to count the different choices of p edges from E(Cn) up to automorphisms. Note that the counting of different p edges on Cn is same as the counting of different n - p edges. Thus for any 0  p  n, we have

p(n) = n-p(n).

(3)

The following lemma is trivial.

Lemma 3.1. For each n  4, 0(n) = n(n) = 1.

Any two signed wheels with exactly one negative edge are automorphic to each other. Therefore, in the view of Equation 3, the following lemma is immediate.

Lemma 3.2. For each n  4, 1(n) = n-1(n) = 1.

We now determine the value of n-2(n) and 2(n).

Lemma

3.3.

For

each

n  4,

2(n)

=

n-2(n)

=

1

+



n-2 2

.

Proof. We classify it into two cases:

Case 1. If two edges form a path P3 then there is only one possibility up to rotations. One such path is P3 = v1v2v3.

Case

2.

If

two

edges

are

disjoint,

then

the

number

of

choices

is



n-2 2



up

to

automorphisms.

Each choice of two edges in Case 1 and Case 2 produces a signed wheel with two negative edges. In

light of Lemma 2.3, all these signed wheels are mutually switching non-isomorphic. This proves that

2(n)

=

n-2(n)

=

1

+



n-2 2

.

A number n is said to have a k-partition if n = 1 + 2 + ... + k, where we assume 1  2  3  ...  k  1. Par(n; k) denotes the set of all k-partitions of n with p(n; k) = |Par(n; k)|. Clearly, the number p(n; k) is zero if n < k. The number p(n - 3; 3) is used to compute n-3(n).

Lemma

3.4.

For

each

n  4,

3(n)

=

n-3(n)

=

p(n

3;

3).

Proof. Since n - 3 edges are to be chosen from Cn, only following three cases are possible:

(i) all n - 3 edges form a path;

(ii) n - 3 edges form two different paths;

(iii) n - 3 edges form three different paths.

6

Clearly, there is only one possibility in case (i), up to rotations. For case (ii), the number of two different

paths comprising n-3 edges is same as the number of partitions of n-3 with exactly two parts. Therefore,

the

number

of

two

different

paths

is



n-3 2

.

For case (iii), let three distinct paths formed by n-3 edges be Pt, Pt , and Pt such that t  t  t  2.

For each t  t  t  2, it is easy to see that there is a unique possibility for three such paths, up to

rotations. Thus the number of three such paths is same as the number of partitions of n - 3 with exactly

3 parts. Hence there are p(n - 3; 3) different choices for three such paths.

Each different possibility of n - 3 edges in case (i), (ii), and (iii) produces a signed wheel with n - 3

negative edges and in light of Lemma 2.3, all these signed wheels are mutually switching non-isomorphic.

Hence

Let  = (Wn, ) be a signed wheel with exactly four negative edges e1, e2, e3, and e4 on Cn. By

Lemma 2.4, it is possible to choose two edges ei and ej

so

that

d(ei, ej)

Again, a rotation

permits

us

to

choose

these

two

edges

as

e1

and

so

that

We

now

proceed

to

compute

4(n) and to do so we will make use of S1, S2, S3 and S4 .

Lemma 3.5. If edges e1, e2, e3 and e4 form a path on Cn, then there is only one signed wheel up to rotation.

Lemma 3.6. If edges e1, e2 and e3 form a path P4 and the edge e4 is at distance at least one from P4,

then

Lemma 3.8. Let edges e1, e2 form a path P3 and e3, e4 be non-adjacent with each other as well as with P3. Then the number of non-automorphic signed wheels is (k - 2)2 and (k - 3)(k - 2) when n = 2k + 1 and n = 2k, respectively.

Proof. Let e1 = v1v2, e2 = v2v3 and P3 = v1v2v3. We classify n into two cases:

Case 1. Let n = 2k + 1. If e3 = v4v5 then due to the reflection passing through v2, the edge e4 can be v6v7, v7v8, ..., v2kv2k+1 for a total of 2k - 5.

7

If e3 = vlvl+1, for 5  l  k + 1, then the edge e4 can be vl+2vl+3, ..., v2k-l+4v2k-l+5 for a total of

2k - 2l + 3. The number of different choices of e3 and e4 is

a total of 2k - 2l + 2. The number of different choices of e3 and e4 is

In Case 1 and Case 2, each choice of e3 and e4 along with P3 produces a signed wheel with four negative edges. By Lemma 2.2, all these signed wheels are pairwise non-automorphic. This completes the proof.

Lemma 3.9. Let (W2k+1, ) be a signed wheel with four negative edges in which d(e1, e2) = r, where

1

Then

the

number

of

non-automorphic

is

[k - (2r + 1)]2.

Proof.

Let e1

= v1v2

and e2

= vr+2vr+3

such that d(e1, e2) = r,

where

1



r





n-4 4

.

We count the

choices for e3 and e4 in the following two cases:

(i) If e3 = v2r+3v2r+4, then due to the reflection passing through the mid-point of e2, the edge e4 can be v3r+4v3r+5, ..., vk+r+2vk+r+3 for a total of k - (2r + 1).
(ii) If e3 = vlvl+1, then e4 can be vl+1+r vl+1+r+1, ..., v(2k+1)-(l-r-3)v(2k+1)-(l-r-3)+1 for a total of 2k - 2l + 4, where 2r + 4  l  k + 1.

Thus if e1 = v1v2, e2 = vr+2vr+3, then the number of choices for e3 and e4 is the sum of all choices obtained in (i) and (ii). Each such choice produces a signed wheel with four negative edges and by Lemma 2.2, all these signed wheels are mutually non-automorphic. Hence the number of non-automorphic signed wheels

is

+ 4(k + 1 - 2r - 3)}

=[k - (2r + 1)]2.

This completes the proof.

Lemma 3.10. Let (W2k, ) be a signed wheel with four negative edges in which d(e1, e2) = r, where

Then

the

Proof.

Let e1

such that d(e1, e2) = r,

where

We count the

different choices for e3 and e4 in the following two cases:

(i) If e3 = v2r+3v2r+4, then due to the reflection passing through the mid-point of e2, the edge e4 can be v3r+4v3r+5, ..., vk+r+2vk+r+3 for a total of k - (2r + 1).
(ii) If e3 = vlvl+1, then e4 can be vl+1+rvl+1+r+1, ..., v(2k)-(l-r-3)v(2k)-(l-r-3)+1 for a total of 2k-2l+3, where 2r + 4  l  k + 1.

Thus the number of non-automorphic signed wheels is

This proves the lemma.

Note that, in light of Lemma 2.3, all the signed wheels counted in Lemma 3.5 to Lemma 3.10 are

switching non-isomorphic. We now compute 4(n) by classifying n into two cases depending upon whether n is odd or even. By 4e(n) and 4o(n), we denote the number of switching non-isomorphic signed wheels with exactly four negative edges, when n is even and odd, respectively. In the following two theorems,

4 Main Results
In this section, we compute the number of switching non-isomorphic signed wheels Wn, for 4  n  10.
Lemma 4.1. The value of 5(10) is 15.
Proof. To count 5(10), the different choices for five edges on C10 are considered in the following cases.
1. If the five edges form a path P6, then there is only one choice for such a path, up to rotation.
2. If the set of five edges is a disjoint union of P5 and P2 then we can assume that P5 = v1v2v3v4v5. Due to the reflection passing through v3 and v8, the possibilities for P2 are v6v7 and v7v8. Therefore there are only two such choices.
3. If the set of five edges is a disjoint union of P4 and P3, we assume that P4 = v1v2v3v4. Due to the reflection passing through the mid points of v2v3 and its opposite edge v7v8, the choices for P3 are v5v6v7 or v6v7v8. Thus there are only two such choices.
4. If the set of five edges is a disjoint union of P4, P21 and P22, where P21 and P22 are paths on two vertices, we assume that P4 = v1v2v3v4. Further, if P21 = v5v6, then P22 can be v7v8, v8v9, v9v10. If P21 = v6v7, then P22 must be v8v9. Hence there are four such choices.
5. If the set of five edges of is a disjoint union of P31, P32 and P2, where P31, P32 are paths on three vertices, we assume that P31 = v1v2v3. If P32 = v4v5v6 then due to the reflection passing through the mid points of v3v4 and its opposite edge v8v9, P2 can be v7v8 or v8v9. If P32 = v5v6v7 then due to the reflection passing through v4 and its opposite vertex v9, P2 must be v8v9. Finally, if P32 = v6v7v8 then due to the reflection passing through mid points of v4v5 and its opposite edge v9v10, P2 must be either v4v5 or v9v10. Thus there are four choices for this case.
6. If the set of five edges is a disjoint union of P3, P21, P22 and P23, where P21, P22 and P23 are paths on two vertices, then there are two such choices, up to automorphisms.
From all the cases considered, we find that 5(10) = 15. These 15 signed W10 are shown in Figure 2.
Lemma 4.2. For 4  n  10 and 0  p  10, the values of p(n) are those listed in Table 1.
Proof. In Table 1, entries of row i, for i = 2, 3, 4, and 5, are computed from Lemma 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and Lemma 3.4 respectively. The values of r(s) for r = s are computed from Lemma 3.1 and of r(s) for r = s - 1 are computed from Lemma 3.2. The values of r-2(r) and of r-3(r) for r = 7, 8, 9, and 10 are computed from Lemma 3.3 and Lemma 3.4, respectively. The values of 4(8) and 4(10)(= 6(10)) are computed from Theorem 3.1 and of 4(9)(= 5(9)) is computed from Theorem 3.2. The value of 5(10) is obtained in Lemma 4.1. This proves the lemma.

Theorem 4.1. For n = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, the number of switching non-isomorphic signed wheels on Wn are those given in Table 2.

5 Conclusion
Recall from Lemma 1.2 that the number of switching non-equivalent signed wheels are 2n. Another way of getting this number is the following.
It was already noticed that any signed wheel is switching equivalent to a signed wheel whose signature is a subset of E(Cn). Also, by Lemma 1.1, any two signed wheels whose signatures are different subsets of E(Cn) are switching non-equivalent. As the total number of subsets of E(Cn) are 2n, there are 2n switching non-equivalent signed wheels on n + 1 vertices. However many of these 2n signed wheels are isomorphic to each other. For this purpose, we have determined the value of p(n), for p = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, n-
