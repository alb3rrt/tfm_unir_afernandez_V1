We will show that the augmented subspace methods have the second order convergence rate which is better than the existing results. These sharper estimates provide a new dependence of convergence rate on the coarse spaces in augmented subspace methods. These new results are also validated by some numerical examples.

1 Introduction
One of the fundamental problems in modern science and engineering society is to solve large-scale eigenvalue problems. This is always a very difficult task to solve high-dimensional eigenvalue problems which come from practical physical and chemical sciences. Compared with linear boundary value problems, there are no so many efficient numerical methods for solving eigenvalue problems with optimal complexity. Solving large-scale eigenvalue problems poses significant challenges for scientific computing. In order to solve large sparse eigenvalue problems, there have developed eigensolvers such as Krylov subspace type methods (Implicitly Restarted Lanczos/Arnoldi Method (IRLM/IRAM) [18]), the Preconditioned INVerse ITeration (PINVIT) method [5, 11, 13], the Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (LOBPCG) method [14, 15], and the Jacobi-Davidson-type techniques [4]. All these popular methods include the orthogonalization steps during computing Rayleigh-Ritz problems which are always the bottlenecks for designing efficient parallel schemes for determining relatively many eigenpairs. Recently, a type of multilevel correction method is proposed for solving eigenvalue problems in [8, 12, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23]. In this multilevel correction scheme, there exists an augmented subspace which is constructed with the help of the low dimensional finite element space defined on the coarse grid.

augmented subspace, we have designed some efficient numerical methods for solving eigenvalue problems and nonlinear equations. This type of augmented subspace methods only need a low dimension finite element space on the coarse mesh and the final finite element space on the finest mesh. This method can also work even the coarse and finest mesh has no nested property which is an extension of the multilevel correction method. The application of this augmented subspace can transform the solution of the eigenvalue problem on the final level of mesh can be reduced to the solution of boundary value problems on the final level of mesh and the solution of the eigenvalue problem on the low dimensional augmented subspace. The multilevel correction method and augmented subspace method give the ways to construct the multigrid method for eigenvalue problems. More important, we can design an eigenpair-wise parallel eigenslver for the eigenvalue problems based on the augmented subspace. This type of parallel method avoids doing orthogonalization and inner-products in the high dimensional space which account for a large portion of the wall time in the parallel computation. For more information, please refer to [23].
The aim of this paper is to give new and sharper error estimates for the augmented subspace method. These new error estimates provide new investigations between the augmented subspace method and the two-grid method [24]. Roughly speaking, we will give the following error estimate for the augmented subspace method
u¯h - u(h +1) a a2(VH ) u¯h - u(h ) a,
which is sharper than the existed results included in [16, 20, 21, 22, 23]. This estimate also shows the dependence of the convergence rate for the augmented subspace method on the low dimensional space VH .
An outline of the paper goes as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the finite element method for the eigenvalue problem and the corresponding error estimates. The augmented subspace method and some enhanced error estimates will be given in Section 3 which is the main part of this paper. In section 4, two choices of the coarse spaces are discussed and some numerical examples are provided to validate the enhanced results in this paper. Some concluding remarks are given in the last section.

2 Discretization by finite element method

In this section, we introduce some notation and error estimates of the finite element approximation for eigenvalue problems. In this paper, the letter C (with or without subscripts) denotes a generic positive constant which may be different at different occurrences. For convenience, the symbols ,
and  will be used in this paper. That x1 y1, x2 y2 and x3  y3, mean that x1  C1y1, x2  c2y2 and c3x3  y3  C3x3 for some constants C1, c2, c3 and C3 that are independent of mesh sizes.
For generality, let V and W denote two Hilbert spaces and V  W . Then let a(·, ·) and b(·, ·) be two positive definite symmetric bilinear forms on V × V and W × W , respectively. Furthermore, based on the bilinear form a(·, ·), we can define the norm on the space V as follows

v a = a(v, v), v  V. Similarly, we can define the norm · b by the bilinear form b(·, ·) on the space W

(2.1)

w b = b(w, w), w  W.

(2.2)

In this paper, we assume that the norm · a is relatively compact with respect to the norm · b [10].

2

In our methodology description, we are concerned with the following general eigenvalue problem: Find (, u)  R × V such that a(u, u) = 1 and

a(u, v) = b(u, v), v  V.

(2.3)

It is well known that the eigenvalue problem (2.3) has an eigenvalue sequence {j} (cf. [2, 7]):

0 < 1  2  · · ·  k  · · · , lim k = ,
k

and associated eigenfunctions

u1, u2, · · · , uk, · · · ,

where a(ui, uj) = ij (ij denotes the Kronecker function). In the sequence {j}, the j are repeated according to their geometric multiplicity.

Now, let us define the finite dimensional subspace approximations of the problem (2.3). For
generality, let Vh denote some type of finite dimensional subspace of the Hilbert space V . It is well known that the finite element method is the widest used way to build the subspace Vh. For easy understanding and as an example, we use the finite element method to build the space Vh. First we generate a shape-regular triangulation Th of the computing domain   Rd (d = 2, 3) into triangles or rectangles for d = 2 (tetrahedrons or hexahedrons for d = 3). The diameter of a cell
K  Th is denoted by hK and the mesh size h describes the maximal diameter of all cells K  Th. Based on the mesh Th, we can construct a finite element space denoted by Vh  V . For simplicity, we set Vh as the Lagrange type finite element space which is defined as follows

Vh = vh  C() vh|K  Pk, K  Th  H01(),

(2.4)

where Pk denotes the polynomial space of degree at most k.
Then, we can define the standard finite element scheme for eigenvalue problem (2.3): Find (¯h, u¯h)  R × Vh such that a(u¯h, u¯h) = 1 and

a(u¯h, vh) = ¯hb(u¯h, vh), vh  Vh.

(2.5)

It is well known that Vh  V is a family of finite-dimensional spaces that satisfy the following assumption: For any w  V

lim inf w - vh a = 0.
h0 vhVh
From [2, 3], the discrete eigenvalue problem (2.5) has eigenvalues: 0 < ¯1,h  ¯2,h  · · ·  ¯k,h  · · ·  ¯Nh,h,
and corresponding eigenfunctions

(2.6)

u¯1,h, u¯2,h, · · · , u¯k,h, · · · , u¯Nh,h,

(2.7)

where a(u¯i,h, u¯j,h) = ij, 1  i, j  Nh (Nh is the dimension of the finite element space Vh). From the min-max principle [2, 3], the eigenvalues of (2.5) provide upper bounds for the first Nh eigenvalues of (2.3)

i  ¯i,h, 1  i  Nh.

(2.8)

For the following analysis in this paper, we define µi = 1/i for i = 1, 2, · · · , and µ¯i = 1/¯i,h for i = 1, · · · , Nh. In order to measure the error of the finite element space to the desired function, we define the following notation

(w, Vh) = inf w - vh a, for w  V.
vh Vh

(2.9)

3

In this paper, we also need the following quantity for error analysis:

a(Vh) = where T : W  V is defined as

sup inf T f - vh a,
f W vhVh f b=1

a(T f, v) = b(f, v), v  V for f  W.

(2.10) (2.11)

In order to understand the method more clearly, we state the error estimate for the eigenpair approximation by the finite element method. For this aim, we define the finite element projection Ph : V  Vh as follows

a(Phw, vh) = a(w, vh), vh  Vh for w  V.

(2.12)

It is obvious that the finite element projection operator Ph has following error estimates.
Lemma 2.1. For any function w  V , the finite element projection operator Ph has following error estimates

w - Phw a = inf w - wh a = (w, Vh),
wh Vh
w - Phw b  a(Vh) w - Phw a.

(2.13) (2.14)

Before stating error estimates of the subspace projection method, we introduce a lemma which comes from [19]. For completeness, a proof is provided here. Lemma 2.2. ([19, Lemma 6.4]) For any eigenpair (, u) of (2.3), the following equality holds
(¯j,h - )b(Phu, u¯j,h) = b(u - Phu, u¯j,h), j = 1, · · · , Nh.
Proof. Since -b(Phu, u¯j,h) appears on both sides, we only need to prove that ¯j,hb(Phu, u¯j,h) = b(u, u¯j,h).
From (2.3), (2.5) and (2.12), the following equalities hold ¯j,hb(Phu, u¯j,h) = a(Phu, u¯j,h) = a(u, u¯j,h) = b(u, u¯j,h).
Then the proof is complete.

The following lemma has already been presented in [22] which gives the error estimates for the one eigenpair approximation. This lemma will be used for analyzing the error estimates for the augmented subspace method for only one eigenpair. For the proof, please refer to [22].
Lemma 2.3. ([22, Lemma 3.3]) Let (, u) denote an exact eigenpair of the eigenvalue problem (2.3). Assume the eigenpair approximation (¯i,h, u¯i,h) has the property that µ¯i,h = 1/¯i,h is closest to µ = 1/. The corresponding spectral projector Ei,h : V  span{u¯i,h} is defined as follows
a(Ei,hw, u¯i,h) = a(w, u¯i,h), for w  V.
Then the following error estimate holds

u - Ei,hu a

(2.16)

Furthermore, the eigenvector approximation u¯i,h has following error estimate in · b-norm

u - Ei,hu b 

1 + µ¯1,h ,h

a(Vh) u - Ei,hu a.

(2.17)

For simplicity of notation, we assume that the eigenvalue gap ,h has a uniform lower bound which is denoted by  (which can be seen as the "true" separation of the eigenvalue  from others) in the following parts of this paper. This assumption is reasonable when the mesh size is small enough. We refer to [17, Theorem 4.6] and Lemma 2.3 in this paper for details of the dependence of error estimates on the eigenvalue gap. Then we have the following simple version of the error estimates based on Lemma 2.3.
Corollary 2.1. Under the conditions of Lemma 2.3, the following error estimates hold

(2.18) (2.19)

In the following part of this section, we consider the error estimates for the first k eigenpair approximations associated with ¯1,h  · · ·  ¯k,h.
Theorem 2.1. Let us define the spectral projection Ek,h : V  span{u¯1,h, · · · , u¯k,h} as follows

a(Ek,hw, u¯i,h) = a(w, u¯i,h), i = 1, · · · , k for w  V.

(2.20)

1  i  k.

(2.22) (2.23)

Proof. Similarly to the duality argument in the finite element method, the following inequality holds

(I - Ph)ui b = sup b((I - Ph)ui, g) = sup a((I - Ph)ui, T g)

g b=1

g b=1

= sup a((I - Ph)ui, (I - Ph)T g)  a(Vh) (I - Ph)ui a.
g b=1

(2.24)

Since (I - Ek,h)Phui  Vh and (I - Ek,h)Phui  span{u¯k+1,h, · · · , u¯Nh,h}, the following orthogonal expansion holds

Nh

(I - Ek,h)Phui =

(2.25)

where j = a(Phui, u¯j,h). From Lemma 2.2, we have

(2.26)

From the orthogonal property of eigenvectors u¯1,h, · · · , u¯m,h, the following equalities hold

This is the second desired result (2.33) and the proof is complete.

Similarly, we assume that the eigenvalue gap k,i,h has a uniform lower bound which is denoted by k,i (which can be seen as the "true" separation of the eigenvalue i from the unwanted eigenvalues) in the following parts of this paper. This assumption is reasonable when the mesh size is small enough. Then we have the following simple version of the error estimates based on Theorem 2.1.
Corollary 2.2. Under the conditions of Theorem 2.1, the following error estimates hold

From Lemma 2.3, Theorem 2.1 and their proofs, we can extend the error estimates in this section to the case that the subspace is VH,h and the space V is replaced by Vh. This understanding will be used to deduce the error estimates for the augmented subspace methods in the following section.

3 Augmented subspace method and its error estimates

In this section, we first present the augmented subspace method for solving the eigenvalue problem
(2.5). This method contains solving auxiliary linear boundary value problem in the finer finite
element space Vh and the eigenvalue problem on the augmented subspace VH,h which is built by the coarse finite element space VH and a finite element function in the finer finite element space Vh. Then, the new convergence analysis is given for this augmented subspace method. We will find the new convergence result is sharper than the existed results in [16, 20, 21, 22, 23].
In order to define the augmented subspace method, we first generate a coarse mesh TH with the mesh size H and the coarse linear finite element space VH is defined on the mesh TH . For simplicity, in this paper, we assume the coarse space VH is a subspace of the finite element space Vh which is defined on the finer mesh Th.
For some given eigenfunction approximations u1(,h) , · · · , u(k,)h which are approximations for the first k eigenfunctions u¯1,h, · · · , u¯k,h of (2.5), we can do the following augmented subspace iteration step which is defined by Algorithm 1 to improve the accuracy of u(1,h) , · · · , u(k,)h.

Algorithm 1: Augmented subspace method for the first k eigenpairs

1. If = 1, we define u(i,h) = u(i,h), i = 1, · · · , k, and the augmented subspace VH,h = VH + span{u(1,h) , · · · , uk,h}. Then solve the following eigenvalue problem: Find (i(,h), u(i,h))  R × VH,h such that a(u(i,h), u(i,h)) = 1 and

a(u(i,h), vH,h) = (i,h)b(u(i,h), vH,h), vH,h  VH,h, i = 1, · · · , k.

(3.1)

2. Solve the following linear boundary value problems: Find u(i,h+1)  Vh such that a(u(i,h+1), vh) = (i,h)b(u(i,h), vh), vh  Vh, i = 1, · · · , k.

(3.2)

3. Define the augmented subspace VH,h = VH + span{u(1,h+1), · · · , u(k,+h 1)} and solve the following eigenvalue problem: Find ((i,h+1), u(i,h+1))  R × VH,h such that a(ui(,h+1), u(i,h+1)) = 1 and
a(u(i,h+1), vH,h) = (i,h+1)b(u(i,h+1), vH,h), vH,h  VH,h, i = 1, · · · , k.
Solve (3.3) to obtain ((1,h+1), u(1,h+1)), · · · , ((k,+h 1), uk( ,+h 1)).
4. Set = + 1 and go to Step 2 for the next iteration until convergence.

(3.3)

Theorem 3.1. Let us define the spectral projection Ek(,h+1) : V  span{u¯(1,h+1), · · · , u¯(k,+h 1)} for any integer  0 as follows

a(Ek(,h+1)w, u(i,h+1)) = a(w, u(i,h+1)), i = 1, · · · , k for w  V.

(3.4)

There exist exact eigenfunction u¯1,h, · · · , u¯k,h of (2.5) such that the resultant eigenfunction approximations u1( +1), · · · , u(k +1) have the following error estimate

(3.6)

Proof. First, let us consider the error estimate for the initial approximations u(11,h) , · · · , u(k1,h) . From Corollary 2.2, there exist exact eigenvectors u¯1,h, · · · , u¯k,h such that the following error estimates
for the eigenvector approximations u(11,h) , · · · , u(k1,h) hold for i = 1, · · · , k

(3.7)

where we have used the inequality a(VH,h)  a(VH ) since VH  VH,h.
Then the result (3.6) holds for = 1. Here the induction method is adopted to prove that (3.5) and (3.6) hold for any  1. For this aim, we assume the estimates (3.5) and (3.6) holds for - 1. Then let us prove that they also hold for based on this assumption.
From Algorithm 1, it is easy to know that u1(,h) , · · · , u(k,)h is the orthogonal basis for the space span{u(1,h) , · · · , u(k,)h}. We define the b(·, ·)-orthogonal projection operator k(,h) to the space span{u(1,h) , · · · , u(k,)h}. Then there exist k real numbers q1, · · · , qk  R such that k(,h) u¯i,h has following expansion

(3.12)

From (3.11) and (3.12), we know that the estimates (3.5) and (3.6) holds for the integer . Then the proof is complete.

Remark 3.1. From the convergence result (3.5) in Theorem 3.1, in order to accelerate the convergence rate, we should decrease the term a(VH ) which depends on the coarse space VH . Then enlarging the subspace VH can accelerate the convergence.

Remark 3.2. In this paper, we are only concerned with the error estimates for the eigenvector approximation since the error estimates for the eigenvalue approximation can be easily deduced from the following error expansion

0  i - ¯i,h =

A(u¯i,h - ), u¯i,h -  (, )

It is obvious that the parallel computing method can be used for Step 2 of Algorithm 1 since

each linear equation can be solved independently. Furthermore, the augmented subspace method

can be used to design a complete parallel scheme for eigenvalue problems. For this aim, we give

another version of the augmented subspace method for only one (may be not the smallest one)

eigenpair. The corresponding numerical method is defined by Algorithm 2. This idea has already

been proposed and analyzed in [23]. But, we will give a sharper error estimate for this type of

method.

In this section, we assume the superscript is closet to an exact

Theorem 3.2. For  1, according to the eigenpair approximation ((h ), u(h ))  R×Vh, we define the spectral projectors Eh( ) : V  span{u(h )} as follows

a(Eh( )w, u(h )) = a(w, u(h )), for w  V.

Then the eigenpair approximation ((h +1), u(h +1))  R × Vh produced by Algorithm 2 satisfies the following error estimates

Algorithm 2: Augmented subspace method for one eigenpair

1. If = 1, we define u(h ) = u(h ) and the augmented subspace VH,h = VH + span{u(h )}. Then solve the following eigenvalue problem: Find ((h ), u(h ))  R × VH,h such that a(uh( ), u(h )) = 1 and

a(u(h ), vH,h) = (h )b(u(h ), vH,h), vH,h  VH,h.

(3.13)

2. Solve the following linear boundary value problem: Find u(h +1)  Vh such that a(u(h +1), vh) = h( )b(u(h ), vh), vh  Vh.

(3.14)

3. Define the augmented subspace VH,h = VH + span{u(h +1)} and solve the following eigenvalue problem: Find ((h +1), u(h +1))  R × VH,h such that a(u(h +1), u(h +1)) = 1 and

a(u(h +1), vH,h) = h( +1)b(uh( +1), vH,h),

vH,h  VH,h.

(3.15)

Solve (3.15) and the output ((h +1), u(h +1)) is chosen such that u(h +1) has the largest component in span{ u(h +1)} among all eigenfunctions of (3.15).

4. Set = + 1 and go to Step 2 for the next iteration until convergence.

Proof. First, let us consider the error estimate for the initial approximations u(h1). From Corollary 2.1, there exist exact eigenfunction u¯h of (2.5) such that the following error estimates hold for the eigenvector approximation u(h1)

Then the result (3.17) holds for = 1. Here the induction method is adopted to prove that (3.16) and (3.17) hold for any  1. For this aim, we assume the estimates (3.16) and (3.17) holds for - 1. Then let us prove that they also hold for based on this assumption.
We define the b(·, ·)-orthogonal projection operator h( ) to the space span{u(h )}. Then there exists a real number q  R such that h( )u¯h = qu(h ). Then from the orthogonal property of the projection operator PH,h, (2.14), (3.7), (3.14) and the induction assumption, the following inequalities hold

4 The application to second order elliptic eigenvalue problem
In this section, we will show the applications of augmented subspace methods to the second order elliptic eigenvalue problem. These numerical schemes can improve the efficiency for solving the
12

eigenvalue problems. Especially, based on the property of the augmented subspace method, the choice of the coarse finite element space VH is independent of the finest finite element space.
Here, we are concerned with the second order elliptic eigenvalue problem, i.e., in (2.3), the bilinear forms a(·, ·) and b(·, ·) are defined as follows

a(u, v) = u · Avd, b(u, v) = uvd,





where   Rd (d = 2, 3) is a bounded domain, A  W 1,() d×d a uniformly positive definite matrix on  and   W 0,() is a uniformly positive function on . We pose homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition to the problem and it means here V = H01() and W = L2() (cf. [1]). In order to use the finite element discretization method, we employ the meshes defined in section 2.
Here the augmented subspace methods defined by Algorithms 1 and 2 are applied to the second order elliptic eigenvalue problem. The main ingredient is to discuss the way to construct the coarse coarse space VH based on the fine space Vh. There have two obvious ways to produce the coarse space VH . In the first way, the coarse space VH and fine space Vh are defined on the same mesh denoted by TH in this section. But the degree of the fine space Th is higher than that of the coarse space VH . This means the coarse space VH is chosen as the linear finite element space. The second way to produce the coarse space is based on the two-grid idea from [24]. In this way, the coarse space VH is defined on the coarse grid TH but the fine space Vh is defined on the finer grid Th. In these two ways, the coarse space VH are both chosen as the linear finite element space on the mesh TH , we have the following estimate for the quantity a(VH ) (cf. [6, 9])

a(VH )  CH,

(4.1)

where the constant depends on the matrix A, scalar  and the shape of the mesh TH . Based on Theorems 3.1 and 3.2, the convergence result can be concluded with the following
inequalities

u¯i,h - Ek(,h+1)ui,h a  C CH 2 u¯i,h - Ek(1,h) ui,h a, u¯i,h - Ek(,h+1)u¯i,h b  CH u¯i,h - Ek(,h+1)u¯i,h a,

(4.2) (4.3)

and

u¯h - Eh( +1)u¯h a  CH 2 u¯h - Eh(1)u¯h a, u¯h - Eh( +1)u¯h b  CH u¯h - Eh( +1)u¯h a.

(4.4) (4.5)

The aim of this section is to check these convergence results by some numerical examples. In these
numerical experiments, Algorithms 1 and 2 are implemented for solving the following standard Laplace eigenvalue problem: Find (, u)  R × H01() such that

 -u = u, in , 

u = 0, on ,



u

2 1

=

1,

(4.6)

where the computing domain is set to be the unit square  = (0, 1) × (0, 1).
In all numerical testes, the initial eigenfunction approximation is produced by solving the eigenvalue problem (4.6) on the coarse space VH . The exact finite element eigenfunction u¯h is obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem directly on the fine space Vh.

13

4.1 Augmented subspace by low order finite element space
In the first subsection, we check the convergence results (4.2)-(4.5) for the fine space is chosen as the high order finite element space. In these tests, the initial eigenfunction approximation is produced by solving the eigenvalue problems on the coarse space VH . Then we do the iteration steps by the augmented subspace method defined by Algorithms 1 and 2.
In the first way, the spaces VH and Vh are defined on the same mesh TH but with different order of finite element methods. Here, VH is chosen as the linear finite element space and the fine mesh Vh is 4-th order finite element space defined on the mesh TH .
In order to validate the convergence results stated in (4.2)-(4.5), we check the numerical errors corresponding to the linear finite element space VH with different sizes H. The aim here is to check the dependence of the convergence rate on the mesh size H. The coarse mesh TH is set to be the regular type of uniform mesh. Figure 1 shows the corresponding convergence behaviors for the first eigenfunction by Algorithm 1 (or Algorithm 2) with the coarse space being the linear finite element space on the mesh with size H = 2/8, 2/16, 2/32 and 2/64. We can find the corresponding convergence rate are 0.044633, 0.012493, 0.0032218 and 0.00081231. These results show that the augmented subspace method defined by Algorithms 1 and 2 should have second order convergence which validates the results (4.2)-(4.5).

The next task is to check the performance of Algorithm 2 for computing the only 4-th eigenpair. Figure 3 shows the corresponding convergence behaviors for the only 4-th eigenfunctions by Algorithm2 withthe coarse space being the linear finite element space on the mesh with size H = 2/8, 2/16, 2/32 and 2/64. The corresponding convergence rate shown in Figure 3 are 0.35918, 0.12588, 0.035169 and 0.0090917. These results show that the augmented subspace method defined by Algorithm 2 has second order convergence which validate the results (4.4)-(4.5).

4.2 Augmented subspace by the finite element space on the coarse mesh
In the second subsection, Vh is chosen as the linear finite element space defined on the finer mesh Th. For this aim, we start from the coarse mesh TH to produce the finer mesh by the regular refinement. In the numerical tests here, we set the size h = 1/256 for the finer mesh Th. Here, VH is chosen as the linear finite element space defined on the coarse mesh TH . The initial eigenfunction approximation is also produced by solving the eigenvalue problems on the coarse space VH . Then we do the iteration steps by the augmented subspace method defined by Algorithms 1 and 2.
In order to validate the convergence results stated in (4.2)-(4.5), we also check the numerical errors corresponding to the linear finite element space VH with different sizes H. The aim is to check the dependence of the convergence rate on the mesh size H. Here, the coarse mesh TH is also set to be the regular type of uniform mesh.
Figure 4 shows the convergence behaviors for the first eigenfunction bythe augmented subspace methods corresponding to the coarse mesh sizes H = 2/4, 2/8, 2/16 and 2/32. The corresponding convergence rates are 0.13142, 0.048523, 0.013652 and 0.0035056. These results

The final task is to check the performance of Algorithm 2 for computing the only 4-th eigenpair. Figure 6 shows the corresponding convergence behaviors for the only 4-th eigenfunctions byAlgorithm 2 with the coarse space being the linear finite element space on the mesh with size H = 2/8,

5 Concluding remarks
In this paper, some enhanced error estimates for the augmented subspace method are deduced for solving eigenvalue problems. We have derived higher order convergence rates than existing results. Based on these new results, we can also produce the corresponding sharper error estimates for the multigrid and multilevel methods which are designed based on the augmented subspace methods and the sequence of grids.
