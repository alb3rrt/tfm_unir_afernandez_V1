FROM TORUS BUNDLES TO PARTICLE-HOLE EQUIVARIANTIZATION
SHAWN X. CUI, PAUL GUSTAFSON, YANG QIU, AND QING ZHANG
Abstract. We continue the program of constructing (pre)modular tensor categories from 3-manifolds first initiated by Cho-Gang-Kim using M theory in physics and then mathematically studied by Cui-Qiu-Wang. An important structure involved is a collection of certain SL(2, C) characters on a given manifold which serve as the simple object types in the corresponding category. Chern-Simons invariants and adjoint Reidemeister torsions play a key role in the construction, and they are related to topological twists and quantum dimensions, respectively, of simple objects. The modular S-matrix is computed from local operators and follows a trial-and-error procedure. It is currently unknown how to produce data beyond the modular S- and T -matrices. There are also a number of subtleties in the construction which remain to be solved. In this paper, we consider an infinite family of 3-manifolds, that is, torus bundles over the circle. We show that the modular data produced by such manifolds are realized by the Z2-equivariantization of certain pointed premodular categories. Here the equivariantization is performed for the Z2-action sending a simple (invertible) object to its inverse, also called the particle-hole symmetry. It is our hope that this extensive class of examples will shed light on how to improve the program to recover the full data of a premodular category.
1. Introduction
Quantum topology emerged from the discovery of Jones polynomial [11] and the formulation of topological quantum field theory (TQFT) [19, 2] in the 1980s. Since then, rapid progress of the subject has revealed deep connections between the algebraic/quantum world of tensor categories and the topological/classical world of 3-manifolds. One bridge connecting these two worlds is given by TQFTs. Roughly speaking, (2 + 1)-dimensional TQFTs that concern the structure of 3-manifolds are characterized by modular tensor categories, a special class of tensor categories. Two fundamental families in (2+1)-dimensions are the Reshetikhin-Turaev [15] and Turaev-Viro [18] TQFTs, both of which are based on certain tensor categories. The latter family serve as a vast generalization of the Jones polynomial to knots in arbitrary 3-manifolds. The resulting quantum invariants from the TQFTs provide insights to understand 3-manifolds. For example, they can distinguish some homotopic equivalent but non-homeomorphic manifolds.
Recently, motivated by M -theory in physics, the authors in [6] proposed another relation between tensor categories and 3-manifolds roughly in the converse direction. Explicitly, they outlined a program to construct modular tensor categories from certain classes of closed oriented 3-manifolds. A central structure to study is a SL(2, C) flat connection which corresponds to a conjugacy class of morphisms from the fundamental group to SL(2, C). The manifolds are required to have finitely many non-Abelian SL(2, C) flat connections, and each must be gauge equivalent to

a SL(2, R) or SU(2) flat connection. Classical invariants such as the Chern-Simons invariant and twisted Reidemeister torsion also play a key role in the construction.
In [7], the authors mathematically explored the program in greater detail. They systemically studied two infinite families of 3-manifolds, namely, Seifert fibered spaces with three singular fibers and torus bundles over the circle whose monodromy matrix has odd trace. It was shown that the first family realize modular tensor categories related to the Temperley-Lieb-Jones category [16], and the second family was related to the quantum group category of type B. Based on their computations, the authors revealed several subtleties in the original proposal and henceforth made a number of insightful improvements. For instance, a simple object in the constructed category should correspond to a non-Abelian SL(2, C) character from the fundamental group, rather than a conjugacy class of SL(2, C) representations. Moreover, the characters are not necessarily conjugate to a SL(2, R) or SU(2) character; rather, they just need to have real Chern-Simons invariants. Also, the category to be constructed may not always be modular, but will be a pre-modular category in general, and conjecturally it is non-degenerate if and only if the first cohomology of the manifold with Z2 coefficients is trivial.
The efforts in [6] and [7] suggest a far-reaching connection between 3-manifolds and (pre)modular tensor categories. However, this program is still at its infancy, and there remain many questions to be resolved. Firstly and foremost, the program currently only provides an algorithm to compute the modular S- and T -matrices. Other data such as F -symbols and R-symbols are still missing. Secondly, even for the modular data, the computation for the S-matrix essentially follows a trialand-error procedure. A definite algorithm to achieve that is in demand. Thirdly, there are also a number of subtleties in choosing the correct set of characters as simple objects, determining the proper unit object, etc. Before these problems can be settled, more case studies are of great value in offering insights from various perspectives, which is the motivation for the current paper. We hope the insights obtained will lead to an intrinsic understanding of how and why this program works.
In this paper, we continue the work of [7] to apply the program to torus bundles over the circle with SOL geometry. The examples of Seifert fibered spaces in [7] covered six of the eight geometries, the ones left being the hyperbolic and SOL. Since the program concerns closed manifolds whose Chern-Simons invariants are all real, hyperbolic manifolds are thus excluded. Torus bundles whose monodromy map is Anosov have SOL geometry. Equivalently, it has SOL geometry if and only if the monodromy matrix A  SL(2, Z) satisfies |Tr(A)| > 2 [1]. In [7], only special cases of Tr(A) being odd were considered, and the resulting modular data is related to the quantum group categories of type B. It was conjectured that other cases correspond to this type of categories as well. However, we prove in the current paper that this is incorrect.
Our main result is that for each torus bundle M with monodromy matrix A, N := |Tr(A) + 2|, there is an associated finite Abelian group G isomorphic to Zr × ZN/r for some integer r  1 and a quadratic form q : G  C× such that the premodular category realized by M is the Z2-equivariantization of C(G, q), where C(G, q) is the pointed premodular category of G-graded vector spaces whose braiding is given by the quadratic form q (see Theorem 4.5). The equivariantization is performed for the Z2-action sending each group element of G to its inverse. This Z2-action is also called the particle-hole symmetry of C(G, q). When r = 1, G

is a cyclic group and the particle-hole equivariantization of C(G, q) is the adjoint subcategory of the metaplectic SO(N )2. When N is additionally odd, we recover the result in [7]. The appearance of equivariantization seems to be a salient feature of torus bundles. We leave it as a future direction to explore a possible topological interpretation of equivariantization.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review some basic facts about premodular categories and recall the program of constructing (pre)modular categories from 3-manifolds. Section 3 is devoted to computing the modular data of the equivariantization of a pointed premodular category under the particle-hole symmetry. In Section 4, we state and prove the main theorem concerning the construction of premodular categories from torus bundles.

2. Preliminaries
2.1. Premodular categories. Here we recall some basic notation and results involving premodular categories. A more detailed treatment is given by standard reference material [4, 9]. Unless otherwise specified, we will always be working over the base field of complex numbers.
Let C be a fusion category. We denote the set of isomorphism classes of simple objects of C by Irr(C) = {X0 = 1, · · · , Xn-1}. We have the fusion rules given by
Xi  Xj = Nik,j Xk,
k
where Nik,j = dim Hom(Xi  Xj, Xk) are called the fusion coefficients. For any Xi  Irr(C), the fusion matrix Ni is given by (Ni)k,j = Nik,j. The largest positive eigenvalue of Ni is called the Frobenius-Perron dimension (or FP-dimension) of Vi and is denoted by FPdim(Vi) (cf. [10]). A simple object V  Irr(C) is called invertible if FPdim(V ) = 1.
A premodular category is a braided fusion category equipped with a ribbon structure. A ribbon structure on a braided monoidal category C is a family of natural isomorphisms V : V  V satisfying
V W = (V  W )  cW,V  cV,W

V  = V
for all V, W  C, where c is the braiding. Let C be a premodular category. The (unnormalized) S-matrix of C has entries

Si,j := trXiXj cXj,Xi  cXi,Xj , Xi, Xj  Irr(C).

A premodular category is said to be modular if its S-matrix is nondegenerate.

The numbers di = Si,0 are called the quantum dimensions of the simple objects

Xi  Irr(C). The sum D2 =

n-1 i=0

d2i

is

called

the

global

dimension

of

C.

As the ribbon isomorphism Xi is an element of End(Xi) for any Xi  Irr(C),

we can write Xi as a scalar i times the identity map on Xi. We call i the twist

of the simple object Xi. The T -matrix for a premodular C is defined to be the

diagonal matrix with entries

Ti,j = ii,j ,

4

where i is the twist of Xi  Irr(C). Note the fusion coefficients and entries of S and T satisfy the following balancing equation

(2.1)

ij Sij =

Nikj dkk.

k

Given a fusion category C, let Cpt denote the full fusion subcategory generated by the invertible objects in C. A fusion category C is said to be pointed if C = Cpt. Every pointed fusion category is equivalent to VecG, which is the category of finite dimensional vector spaces graded by a finite group G with the associativity given by the 3-cocycle   Z3(G, C×).
Let G be an finite abelian group, q : G  C× be a quadratic form, and  : G  C× be a character such that 2 = 1. As shown in [8], there exists a pointed
premodular category C(G, q, ) with the following properties:

· the simple objects of C(G, q, ) are parametrized by G, and the monoidal

product is given by the group product;

·

Sgh

= b(g, h)(g)(h),

where

b

is

the

bicharacter

b(g, h) :=

q(gh) q(g)q(h)

;

and

· Tg = q(g)(q).

Moreover, every pointed premodular category is equivalent to some C(G, q, ). When  is trivial, we simply denote it as C(G, q).

2.2. Equivariantization. For a group G, let G be the tensor category whose objects are elements of G and morphisms are identities. The tensor product is given by the multiplication of G. Let C be a fusion category with an action of G on C given by the tensor functor T : G  Aut(C); g  Tg. For any g, h  G let g,h be the isomorphism Tg  Th  Tgh that defines the tensor structure on the functor T . A G-equivariant object is a pair (X, u), where X  C and u = ug : Tg(X)  X | g  G , such that ugh  g,h = ug  Tg (uh) for all
g, h  G. The morphisms between equivariant objects are morphisms in C commuting with ug, g  G. The category of G-equivariant objects of C, which is denoted by CG, is called the G-equivariantization of C [14, 5, 8]. CG is a fusion category with the tensor product given by (X, u)  (Y, w) := (X  Y, u  w), where (u  w)g := (ug  wg)  (µgX,Y )-1 and µgX,Y : Tg(X)  Tg(Y )  Tg(X  Y ) is the tensorator for T .

2.3. A program to construct premodular categories from three manifolds. We first recall two key ingredients, Chern-Simons invariant and Reidemeister torsion, that are used in the construction.

2.3.1. Chern-Simons invariant. Let X be a closed oriented 3-manifold and  :

1(X) - SL(2, C) be a group morphism. Denote by A the corresponding Lie algebra sl(2, C)-valued 1-form on X. The Chern-Simons (CS) invariant of  is defined as

mod 1.

It is a basic property that CS() only depends on the character induced by . We

will use this fact below implicitly. It is in general very difficult to compute the CS

invariant directly using the integral definition. Various techniques are developed in

the literature for the calculations. See for instance, [3], [12]. Usually, it involves

5

cutting the manifold into simpler pieces, computing the CS for each piece, and inferring CS of the target manifold from that of the pieces.

2.3.2. Adjoint Reidemeister torsion. We first recall some basics about the Reidemeister torsion (R-torsion). For more details, please refer to, e.g., [13] and [17].
Let
C = (0 - Cn -n Cn-1 -n-1 · · · -1 C0 - 0)

be a chain complex of finite dimensional vector spaces over the field C. Choose a basis ci of Ci and a basis hi of the i-th homology group Hi(C). The torsion of C with respect to these choices of bases is defined as follows. For each i, let bi be a set of vectors in Ci such that i(bi) is a basis of Im(i) and let h~i denote a lift of hi in Ker(i). Then the set of vectors ~bi := i+1(bi+1)  h~i  bi is a basis of Ci. Let Di be the transition matrix from ci to ~bi. To be specific, each column of Di corresponds to a vector in ~bi being expressed as a linear combination of vectors in ci. Define the torsion

n

 (C, c, h) :=

det(Di)(-1)i+1

i=0

We remark that the torsion does not depend on the choice of bi and the lifting
of hi. Also, we define the torsion as the absolute value of the usual torsion in the literature, and thus we do not need to deal with sign ambiguities.
Let X be a finite CW-complex and (V, ) be a homomorphism  : 1(X) -
SL(V ) for some vector space V . Then V turns into a left Z[1(X)]-module via . The universal cover X~ has a natural CW structure from X, and its chain complex C(X~ ) is a free left Z[1(X)]-module via the action of 1(X) as covering transformations. View C(X~ ) as a right Z[1(X)]-module by .g := g-1. for   C(X~ ) and g  1(X). We define the twisted chain complex C(X; ) := C(X~ ) Z[1(X)] V . Let {ei} be the set of i-cells of X ordered in an arbitrary way. Choose a lifting e~i of ei in X~ . It follows that Ci(X~ ) is generated by {e~i} as a free Z[1(X)]-module (left or right). Choose a basis of {v} of V . Then ci() := {e~i  v } is a C-basis of Ci(X; ).

Definition 2.1. Let  : 1(X) - SL(V ) be a representation.
(1) We call  acyclic if C(X; ) is acyclic. Assume  is acyclic. The torsion of X twisted by  is defined to be,

 (X; ) :=  C(X; ), c() .

(2) Let Adj : SL(V )  SL(sl(V )) be the adjoint representation of SL(V ) on its Lie algebra sl(V ). We call  adjoint acyclic if Adj   is acyclic. Assume  is adjoint acyclic. Define the adjoint Reidemeister torsion of  to be,
Tor() := Tor(X; ) :=  (X; Adj  ).
In this paper, we will only deal with the adjoint Reidemeister torsion . In the sequel, we simply call it the torsion of  if there is no potential confusion.

2.3.3. Constructing modular data from 3-manifolds. In this subsection, we briefly review the construction of modular data from 3-manifolds explained in [6] and [7]. We refer the readers to [7] for more detailed discussions.

Definition 2.2. Let X be a closed oriented 3-manifold, and let  be an SL(2, C)character of X.
·  is non-Abelian if at least one representation  : 1(X)  SL(2, C) with character  is non-Abelian, i.e.  has non-Abelian image in SL(2, C).
· A non-Abelian character  is adjoint-acyclic if each non-Abelian representation  : 1(X)  SL(2, C) with character  is adjoint-acyclic, and furthermore, the adjoint Reidemeister torsion of all such non-Abelian representations are the same.
· A candidate label set L(X) is a finite set of adjoint-acyclic non-Abelian SL(2, C) characters of X with a pre-chosen character 0 such that CS() - CS(0) is a rational number for any   L(X).
We remark that for the torus bundles M over the circle to be considered in Section 4, there are only finitely many non-Abelian characters and all of them are adjoint-acyclic. We always choose L(M ) to be the set of all non-Abelian characters.
The potential premodular category corresponding to X has L(X) as the set of isomorphism classes of simple objects. Each character in L(X) is a simple object type, and the pre-chosen one 0 is the tensor unit.
The CS and torsion invariants are both well defined for characters in L(X) (the latter being by definition). They are related to the twists and quantum dimensions. Specifically, denote by  the twist, and by d the quantum dimension, of   L(X). Also denote by D2 the total dimension squared of the potential premodular category. Then

(2.3)

 = e-2i(CS()-CS(0)),

(2.4)

D2 = 2Tor(0),

(2.5)

d2

=

D2 2Tor(

)

.

Apparently, for the above structures to be realized by a genuine premodular

category, there must be some constraints on the label set. See [7] for the definition

of an admissible label set. Below, we will always assume L(X) is admissible.

To define the S-matrix, we first need to introduce the notion of local operators.

Definition 2.3. A primitive loop operator of X is a pair (a, R), where a is a conjugacy class of the fundamental group 1(X) of X and R a finite dimensional irreducible representation of SL(2, C).

Given an SL(2, C)-representation  of 1(X) and a primitive loop operator (a, R), the weight of the loop operator (a, R) with respect to  is W(a, R) := TrR((a)). It can be shown that W(a, R) only depends on the character of .
It is assumed that each simple object type  corresponds to a finite collection of primitive loop operators

(2.6)

  {(a, R)}.

For a choice of  = ±1, we define the W -symbols

(2.7)

W () :=

W  (a, R ), ,   L(X).



FROM TORUS BUNDLES TO PARTICLE-HOLE EQUIVARIANTIZATION

7

The W -symbols and the unnormalized S-matrix are related by

(2.8)

W ()

=

S S0

or S = W()W0(),

where 0 denotes the tensor unit 0. In particular, the quantum dimension is given by the equation

(2.9)

d = W0()

Unfortunately, we do not yet know how the correspondence between simple objects and local operators is defined. Rather, it currently involves a trial-and-error procedure. We try to guess a form of the correspondence, and check whether the resulting S-matrix is consistent with other data such as the twists and the quantum dimensions obtained in Equations 2.3 and 2.5.

3. Equivariantization of particle-hole symmetry

Let C(G, q) denote the premodular category associated to an finite abelian group
G and a quadratic form q : G  C as defined in [8]. In this section, we consider the Z2-equivariantization of the premodular category C(G, q)Z2 , where the group action Z2  Aut(C(G, q)Z2 ) corresponds to the involution g  g-1 in G. We then define a spherical structure, braiding, and (S, T ) matrices for C(G, q)Z2 in the
special case relevant to our torus bundle construction.

3.1. Z2-equivariantization of C(G, q). As a fusion category, C(G, q)Z2 has the following simple objects:

Invertible objects: Xb+, Xb-, for each b = -b, b  G. Two-dimensional objects: Ya,-a for each a = -a, a  G.

For simplicity, we denote Ya := Ya,-a, and hence Ya = Y-a.

Proposition 3.1. The fusion rules of C(G, q)Z2 are given by

3.2. S- and T - matrices in a special case. We now specialize to the case that rank(G)  2. Fixing a surjective homomorphism Z × Z  G, we further assume the existence of a well-defined quadratic form q~ : G  ZN given by

(3.1)

q~(x1, x2) = c1x21 + c2x1x2 + c3x22

for some c1, c2, c3  Z and independent of the choice of representative (x1, x2)  Z × Z. We denote the associated bilinear form by , where  : G × G  ZN defined by (x, y) = q~(x + y) - q~(x) - q~(y), where x = (x1, x2), y = (y1, y2)  G. Thus  can be expressed explicitly as

(3.2)

(x, y) = 2c1x1y1 + c2(x1y2 + x2y1) + 2c3x2y2.

In this case, we consider the pointed premodular category C(G, q) where q is a

Let

be the forgetful functor. We can equip the fusion category C(G, q)Z2 defined in the

previous section with a premodular structure as follows. We define the braiding cX,Y in C(G, q)Z2 by cX,Y = cF (X),F (Y ). Similarly, we define X for X  C(G, q)Z2 by X = F (X).
Combining the twists with the fusion rules described in Proposition 3.1, we

compute the corresponding S-matrix using the balancing equation 2.1:

4. Premodular categories from SOL geometry

In this section, we consider a class of 3-manifolds with SOL geometry. Let M be a

torus bundle over the circle S1 with the monodromy map A =

a c

b d

 SL(2, Z).

That is, M is obtained from the product of the torus T 2 with the interval [0, 1]

by identifying the top and the bottom tori via a self diffeomorphism A. It is

known that M has the SOL geometry if and only if |a + d| > 2 which is to be

assumed below. We first provide the character variety of M , and then show that

the modular data produced from M is realized by the Z2 equivariantization of some

pointed premodular categories. Throughout this section, set N = |a + d + 2| > 0.

4.1. Character variety of torus bundles. Let M be a torus bundle as above. Its fundamental group has the presentation

(4.1)

1(M ) = x, y, h | xayc = h-1xh, xbyd = h-1yh, xyx-1y-1 = 1 ,

where x and y are the meridian and longitude of the torus, respectively, and h corresponds to a loop around the S1 component. We consider non-Abelian char-
acters of representations  : 1(M )  SL(2, C). According to [7], a representation realizing each character is described as follows.
The irreducible representations are given by

(4.3)

for some integers µ and . Since the coefficient matrix for Equation 4.3 is nonsingular (its determinant is ±N ), each irreducible representation is determined by the pair (µ, ) and hence denoted Y (µ, ).
The reducible representations are of the form

a.

Let P be the quadruple that records the parity of the entries (a, d; b, c) and we use `e' to denote for `even' and `o' for `odd'. For instance, P = (e, e; o, e) means b is odd and the rest are even. We then have the following possible values for x and y in each case:
· x = 0, y = 0, with no restrictions on P ; · x = 1, y = 1, only if P = (e, e; o, o) or P = (o, o; e, e); · x = 0, y = 1, only if P = (o, o; o, e) or P = (o, o; e, e); · x = 1, y = 0, only if P = (o, o; e, o) or P = (o, o; e, e).

We can also refer to pairs (x, y) in (µ, )-coordinates using Equation 4.3 and defining k = x(N/2) and l = y(N/2). From Equation 4.5, we see that for each fixed x and y, there are four inequivalent representations but only two characters, which we denote by X±(µ, ).
The torsions and Chern-Simons invariants are explicitly computed in [7]. In
particular, we have

4.2. Solution space. We consider solutions (k, l) of Equation 4.3 in ZN × ZN . Note that, for now we do not place any additional restrictions on the solutions. We denote this solution space by G.

Lemma 4.1. G is a subgroup of ZN × ZN isomorphic to Zr × Z N , where r = r

Define the chain complex Z×Z -g Z×Z -f ZN ×ZN where g =

a+1 b

c d+1

.

Then Im(f ) = Z × Z/ ker(f ) and ker(f ) = Im(g). By considering the Smith normal

form of g, we obtain an isomorphism G = Zr × ZN/r where r = gcd(a + 1, c, b, d +

1).

We can use G to characterize non-Abelian characters of M by the following lemma.

Lemma 4.2. The irreducible characters Y (µ, ) of M are in one-to-one correspondence with subsets {g, -g}  G where 2g = 0. In addition, the pairs X±(µ, ) of
reducible non-Abelian characters are in one-to-one correspondence with elements
g  G such that 2g = 0.

Proof. Suppose that (µ, )  G corresponds to a representation  as in Equation
4.2 which is not necessarily non-Abelian. We first show that  is non-Abelian if
and only if 2(µ, ) = 0. According to the previous subsection,  is non-Abelian if
and only if (x), (y) do not both take values in {I, -I}, which is equivalent to the statement that (x2), (y2) are not both I. Since 2(µ, ) corresponds to the representation (x  (x2), y  (y2), h  (h)), the claim follows from the fact
that the representation (x  I, y  I, h  (h)) corresponds to 0  G.
Suppose that (µ1, 1), (µ2, 2)  G correspond to the same irreducible character. Let (k1, l1) and (k2, l2) be the corresponding solutions to Equation 4.3, and 1 and 2 be the corresponding representations as defined in Equation 4.2. Then either 1(x) = 2(x) and 1(y) = 2(y), or 1(x) = 2(x-1) and 1(y) = 2(y-1), which implies that (µ1, 1) = ±(µ2, 2). This proves the first part of the lemma.
For the second part, let  denote a reducible non-Abelian representation, and let
x, y  {0, 1} be the corresponding sign exponents as defined in Equation 4.4. By considering the diagonal entries of (x) and (y), such a representation  exists if
and only if the following equations are satisfied.

The solutions of above equations are in one-to-one correspondence with elements
in G of order 1 or 2. Fixing (x, y), the corresponding characters occur in pairs X±(µ, ). This proves the second part of the lemma.

We now define a map q^ : Z × Z  ZN by q^(µ, ) = c2 + (a - d)µ - bµ2.

Lemma 4.3. The map q^ induces a quadratic form q~ : G  ZN .

Proof. Since ker(f ) = Im(g) =

a+1 c b d+1

i j

i, j  Z , it suffices to show

that q^(µ + a + 1,  + b) = q^(µ, ) and q^(µ + c,  + d + 1) = q^(µ, ) for general µ and

. We have q^(µ + a + 1,  + b) - q^(µ, ) = c( + b)2 + (a - d)(µ + a + 1)( + b) - b(µ + a + 1)2 - q^(µ, ) = -b(d - a + 2a + 2)µ + (2bc + (a - d)(a + 1)) - b(-bc + (d - a)(a + 1) + (a + 1)2) = (-2 + 2ad - ad + a2 + a - d) - b(1 - ad + ad - a2 + d - a + a2 + 2a + 1) = (-2 + a(-a - 2) + a2 + a + 2 + a) = 0,

and q^(µ + c,  + d + 1) - q^(µ, ) = c( + (d + 1))2 + (a - d)(µ + c)( + d + 1) - b(µ + c)2 - q^(µ, ) = c(2(d + 1) + (a - d)) + ((a - d)(d + 1) - 2bc)µ + c((d + 1)2 + (a - d)(d + 1) - bc) = (-d2 - d + a - ad + 2)µ + c(d + 1 + ad + a - bc) =0

Thus q^ induces a well defined map q~ : G  ZN . It is routine to check that this map is a quadratic form.

4.3. S- and T - matrices from torus bundles. We define the loop operators for non-Abelian characters by
X±(µ, )  (xmyn, Sym0)
Y (µ, )  (xmyn, Sym1) where m = -bµ + (a - 1), n = (-d + 1)µ + c, and Symj denotes the unique (j + 1)-dimensional irreducible representation of SL(2, C). We choose X+(0, 0) to correspond to the monoidal unit object. Each character can be represented by infinitely many representatives (µ, )  Z × Z, but as the following lemma shows, the S-matrix is independent of this choice.

Lemma 4.4. Let Sl be the S-matrix constructed from loop operators as above, then

Sl

where (µ1, 1, µ2, 2) = q~(µ1 + µ2, 1 + 2) - q~(µ1, 1) - q~(µ2, 2) is the bilinear form associated to the quadratic form q~ : G  ZN defined in Lemma 4.3.

Proof. From Equation 2.7, we have the following W -symbols

WX±(µ1,1)(X ±(µ2, 2)) = WY (µ1,1)(X ±(µ2, 2)) = 1
WX±(µ1,1)(Y (µ2, 2)) = Tr(X ±(µ1, 1)(xm2 yn2 )) WY (µ1,1)(Y (µ2, 2)) = Tr(Y (µ1, 1)(xm2 yn2 ))

Defining

q

:

U (1)

by

q(x)

=

e , 2iq~(x) N

we

have

the

premodular

category

C(G, q) and its Z2-equivariantization C(G, q)Z2 as described in Section 3. Our main

theorem is the following.

Theorem 4.5. The S- and T -matrices constructed from torus bundles with Sol geometry coincide with those of the Z2-equivariantization C(G, q)Z2 .

Proof.

From

Equations

4.3

and

4.7,

we

have

CS()

=

-c+(d-a)µ+bµ2 N

=

-

q~(µ,) N

.

Thus, the T -matrix of C(G, q)Z2 as defined in Section 3.2 coincides with the one

constructed directly from the torus bundle as defined in Equation 2.3.

Let Se denote the S-matrix from the Z2-equivariantization C(G, q)Z2 as defined in Section 3.2, and let Sl denote the S-matrix from the local operator construction

as defined in Lemma 4.4. We first consider the following entry:

Se
X ± (µ1 ,1 ),X ± (µ2 ,2 )

=

q(X(µ1 + µ2, 1 + 2)) q(X(µ1, 1))q(X(µ2, 2))

When X(µ1, 1) = X(µ2, 2), according to the group structure of G we have

X(µ1 + µ2, 1 + 2) = X(0, 0).

Thus

Se
X ± (µ1 ,1 ),X ± (µ2 ,2 )

=

1.

Similarly, if

X(µi, i)

=

X(0, 0)

for

either

i,

then

clearly

Se
X ± (µ1 ,1 ),X ± (µ2 ,2 )

=

1.

When X(µ1, 1) = X(µ2, 2) and (µi, i) = (0, 0) for all i, then the charac-

ters X(µ1 + µ2, 1 + 2), X(µ1, 1), and X(µ2, 2) are all distinct. Using the

notation of Section 4.1, these characters must correspond to the cases (x, y) 

{(1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)}. As mentioned in that section, this can only occur if the pari-

ties of (a, d; b, c) are (o, o; e, e). Using the fact that ad-bc = 1, one obtains that N =

a + d + 2 = 0 (mod 4). Thus Equation 4.7 reduces to CS(X(µ, )) = (bx + cy)/4.

By inspection, one finds that applying q(µ, ) = exp(-2iCS(X(µ, ))) to the (µ, )

corresponding to (x, y)  {(1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)} yields either the multiset -1, -1, 1

or

1, 1, 1.

Thus

Se
X ± (µ1 ,1 ),X ± (µ2 ,2 )

= 1.

Next we consider

SXe ±(µ1,1),Y

(µ2 ,2 )

=

2

q(Y (µ1 q(X (µ1,

+ µ2, 1 + 2)) 1))q(Y (µ2, 2))

.

Without loss of generality, we only need to consider two cases: (µ1, 1) corre-

sponding

to

(k1

=

N 2

,

l1

=

0)

where

the

parity

of

(a, d; b, c)

is

(o, o; e, o),

and

(µ1, 1)

corresponding

to

(k1

N 2

,

l1

for

(o, o; e, e)

and

(e, e; o, o).

When k1

l2

Thus

(k2

= 2 exp (i(k2 - l2))

Since k2 - l2 = (b + d + 1)µ2 - (a + c + 1)2 and b + d + 1, a + c + 1 are both

even,

k2

- l2

is

even.

Thus

Se
X±(µ1,1),Y (µ2,2)

=

2.

Lastly, it follows from their definitions in Lemma 4.4 and Section 3.2 that

SYe (µ1,1),Y (µ2,2) = SYl (µ1,1),Y (µ2,2).
