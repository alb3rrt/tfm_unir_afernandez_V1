Abstract
Stochastic averaging for a class of backward stochastic differential equations driven by both standard and fractional Brownian motions (SFrBSDEs in short), is investigated. An averaged SFrBSDEs for the original SFrBSDEs is proposed, and their solutions are quantitatively compared. Under some appropriate assumptions, the solutions to original systems can be approximated by the solutions to averaged stochastic systems in the sense of mean square and also in probability.

1 Introduction

Backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs in short) were first introduced by Pardoux

and Peng [11] with Lipschitz assumption under which they proved the celebrated existence

and uniqueness result. This pioneer work was extensively used in many fields like stochastic

interpretation of solutions of PDEs and financial mathematics. Few years later, several

authors investigated BSDEs with respect to fractional Brownian motion BtH t0 with Hurst

parameter H. This process is a self-similar, i.e. BaHt has the same law as aH BtH for any a > 0,

it has a long but for H =

range dependence

this

process

For

semimartingale.

we obtain a standard Wiener process, These properties make this process a

useful driving noise in models arising in physics, telecommunication networks, finance and

other fields.

Bender [3] gaves one of the earliest result on fractional BSDEs (FrBSDEs in short). The

author established an explicit solution of a class of linear FrBSDEs with arbitrary Hurst pa-

rameter H. This is done essentially by means of solution of a specific linear parabolic PDE.

There are two major obstacles depending on the properties of fractional Brownian motion:

Firstly, the fractional Brownian motion is not a semimartingale except for the case of Brow-

nian

motion

(H

=

1 2

),

hence

the

classical

Itô

calculus

based

on

semimartingales

cannot

be

transposed directly to the fractional case. Secondly, there is no martingale representation

theorem with respect to the fractional Brownian motion. Studing nonlinear fractional BS-

DEs,

Hu

and

Peng

[7]

overcame

successfully

the

second

obstacle

in

the

case

H

>

1 2

by

means

of the quasi-conditional expectation. The authors prove existence and uniqueness of the so-

lution but with some restrictive assumptions on the generator. In this same spirit, Maticiuc

and Nie [9] interesting in backward stochastic variational inequalities, improved this first

result by weakening the required condition on the drift of the stochastic equation. Fei et al

[5] introduced the following type of BSDEs driven by both standard and fractional Brownian

motions (SFrBSDEs in short)

(1.1)

where (Bt)t0 is a standard Brownian motion, BtH t0 is a fractional Brownian motion and {t}0tT is a solution of a stochastic differential equation driven by both standard and fractional Brownian motions. In [5], the authors abtained the existence and uniqueness of the

solution of SFrBSDEs under Lipschitz assumptions. Recently, new classes of BSDEs driven

by two mutually independent fractional Brownian motions were introduced by Aidara and

Sagna [1]. They established the existence and uniqueness of solutions.

Stochastic averaging principle, which is usually used to approximate dynamical systems

under random fluctuations, has long and rich history in multiscale problems (see, e.g.,[10]).

Recently, the averaging principle for BSDEs and one-barrier reflected BSDEs, with Lipschitz

coefficients, were first studied by Jing and Li [8]. In the present paper, we study a stochastic

averaging technique for a class of the SFrBSDEs (1.1). We present an averaging principle,

and prove that the original SFrBSDEs can be approximated by an averaged SFrBSDEs in the

sense of mean square convergence and convergence in probability, when a scaling parameter

tends to zero.

The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2, we recall some definitions and

results about fractional stochastic integrals and the related Itô formula. In Section 3, we

investigate the averaging principle for the SFrBSDEs under some proper conditions.

2 Fractional Stochastic calculus
Let  be a non-empty set, F a -algebra of sets , P a probability measure defined on F and {Ft, t  [0, T ]} a -algebra generated by both standard and fractional Brownian motions. The triplet (, F , P) defines a probability space and E the mathematical expectation with respect to the probability measure P.

The fractional Brownian motion BtH t0 with Hurst parameter H  (0, 1) is a zero mean Gaussian process with the covariance function

E[BtH BsH ]

=

t2H + s2H - |t - s|2H

,

t, s  0.

Suppose that the process BtH t0 is independent of the standard Brownian motion (Bt)t0. Throughout this paper it is assumed that H  (1/2, 1) is arbitrary but fixed.
Denote (t, s) = H(2H - 1)|t - s|2H-2, (t, s)  R2. Let  and  be measurable functions
on [0, T ]. Define

(u, v)(u)(v)dudv and

Note that, for any t  [0, T ], ,  t is a Hilbert scalar product. Let H be the completion of the set of continuous functions under this Hilbert norm · t and (n)n be a sequence in H such that i, j T = ij. Let PTH be the set of all polynomials of fractional Brownian motion. Namely, PTH contains all elements of the form

F () = f

The divergence operator DH is closable from L2(, F , P) to L2(, F , P, H). Hence we can consider the space D1,2 is the completion of PTH with the norm
||F ||21,2 = E|F |2 + E||DsH F ||2T .

Now we introduce the Malliavin -derivative DHt of F by

T
DHt F = (t, s)DsHF ds 0

and denote by L1H,2 the space of all stochastic processes F : (, F , P) - H such that

We introduce the following sets (where E denotes the mathematical expectation with respect to the probability measure P) :

· Cp1,o2l([0, T ] × R) is the space of all C 1,2-functions over [0, T ] × R, which together with their derivatives are of polynomial growth,

· V[0,T ] =

Definition 3.2. A triplet of processes (Yt, Z1,t, Z2,t)0tT is called a solution to SFrBSDE (3.2), if (Yt, Z1,t, Z2,t)0tT  V[0,T ] × V[0,T ] × V[0,T ] and satisfies eq.(3.2).
We have the following (see [[5], Theorem 5.3])

Theorem 3.3. Assume that 1 and 2 are continuous and ||2t defined by eq.(3.1) is a strictly increasing function of t. Let the SFrBSDE (3.2) has a solution of the form
(Yt = (t, t), Z1,t = -1(t, t), Z2,t = -2(t, t)), where   C 1,2([0, T ] × R). Then

1(t, x) = 1(t)x (t, x), 2(t, x) = 2(t)x (t, x).

The next proposition will be useful in the sequel.

Proposition 3.4. Let (Yt, Z1,t, Z2,t)0tT be a solution of the SFrBSDE (3.2). Then for

almost t  [0, T ],

DtYt = Z1,t,

and

DHt Yt

=

2 2

(t) (t)

Z2,t

.

Proof. Since (Yt, Z1,t, Z2,t) satisfies the SFrBSDE (3.2) then we have Y = (·, ) where   C 1,2([0, T ] × R). From Theorem 3.3, we have

Z1,t = 1(t)x (t, x), Z2,t = 2(t)x (t, x).

Then we can write DtYt = 1(t)x (t, x) = Z1,t and

DHt Yt =

3.2 An averaging principle

In this section, we are going to investigate the averaging principle for the FrBSDEs under non Lipschitz coefficients. Let us consider the standard form of equation (3.2):

where t = 0 + 2H b(s)ds + H 1(s)dBs + H 2(s)dBsH, t  [0, T ].

According to the second part, equation (3.3) also has an adapted unique and square

integrable solution. We will examine whether the solution Yt can be approximated to the solution process Y t of the simplified equation:

T

T

T

Y t = +2H f r, Y r, Z1,r, Z2,r dr-H Z1,rdBr -H ZrdBrH , t  [0, T ]; (3.4)

t

t

where Y t, Z1,t, Z2,t has the same properties as Yt, Z1,t, Z2,t .

We assume that the coefficients f and f are continuous functions and satisfy the following assumption:
· (A1) There exists L > 0 such that, for all (t, x, y, z1, z2, y, z1 , z2 )  [0, T ] × R7, we have
|f (t, x, y, z1, z2) - f (t, x, y, z1 , z2 )|2  L |y - y|2 + |z1 - z1 |2 + |z2 - z2 |2

· (A2) For any t  [0, T1]  [0, T ] and for all (x, y, z1, z2)  R × R × R × R, we have

1 T1 - t

T1 f (s, x, y, z1, z2) - f (x, y, z1, z2) 2 ds  (T1 - t) 1 + |y|2 + |z1|2 + |z2|2

where  is a bounded function.

In what follows, we establish the result which will be useful in the sequel.

Lemma 3.5. Suppose that the original SFrBSDEs (3.3) and the averaged SFrBSDEs (3.4) both satisfy the assumptions (A1) and (A2). For a given arbitrarily small number u  [0, t]  [0, T ], there exist L1 > 0 and C2 > 0 such that

Obviously, the above estimate implies that there exist   [0, 1] and K > 0 such that for evry t  (0, K-2H]  [0, T ],

is constant.
Consequently, for any number 1 > 0, we can choose 1  [0, 0] such that for every 1  [0, 0] and for each t  (0, K-2H]

sup E Yt - Y t 2  1.
K -2H  tT

(3.17)

This completes the proof.

With Theorem 3.6, it is easy to show the convergence in probability between solution processes Yt to the original (3.3) and Y t to the averaged (3.4).
Corollary 3.7. Let the assumptions (A1) and (A2) hold. For a given arbitary small number 2 > 0, there exists 2  [0, 0] such that for all   (0, 2], we have

lim P

sup Yt - Y t > 2

Proof. By Theorem 3.6 and the Chebyshev inequality, for any given number 2 > 0, we can obtain

Let   0 and the required result follows.

Remark 3.8. Corollary 3.7 means the convergence in probability between the original solution Yt, Z1,t, Z2,t and the averaged solution Y t, Z1,t, Z2,t .
