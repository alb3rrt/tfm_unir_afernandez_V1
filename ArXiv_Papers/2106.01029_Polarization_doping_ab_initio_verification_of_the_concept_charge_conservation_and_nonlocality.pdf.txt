Abstract In this work, we study the emergence of polarization doping in AlxGa1-xN layers with graded composition from a theoretical viewpoint. We demonstrate that the charge conservation law applies for fixed and mobile charge separately, leading to nonlocal compensation phenomena involving bulk fixed and mobile charge and polarization sheet charge at the heterointerfaces. The magnitude of the effect allows obtaining technically viable mobile charge density for optoelectronic devices without impurity doping (donors or acceptors). Therefore, it provides an additional tool for the device designer, with the potential to attain high conductivities: high carrier concentrations can be obtained even in materials with high dopant ionization energies, and the mobility is not limited by scattering at ionized impurities.

There are a number of materials whose crystalline symmetry allows the occurrence of spontaneous polarization, e.g. wurtzite III-nitride semiconductors.1 The spontaneous polarization is proportional to the shift of the center of mass of electron charge with respect to atomic core, which leads to the emergence of electric dipoles.1 In III-nitrides, the magnitude of such dipoles is different for GaN, AlN and InN. Additionally, external strain may change the lattice symmetry, which may, in turn, lead to the appearance of polarization or to a change in the polarization.2,3 Polarization induces a variety of physical effects. In heterostructures, polarization leads to the emergence of electric fields. Generally, for thick layers, the macroscopic electric fields are negligible due to charge screening.3 Depending on the electric properties the screening may be of different nature, described by Debye-Hückel or ThomasFermi approximations.4,5 Polarization-induced electric fields are observed at nanometerdistance of heterostructures only. An example of device that can exploit the polarizationinduced electric field is the GaN-based field effect transistor.6 In other devices, such as laser diodes (LDs) and light emitting diodes (LEDs) based on III-nitride multi-quantum-well structures, electric fields can play a detrimental role by reducing the radiative recombination probability, which is known as quantum confined Stark effect.7,8,9 Efforts to remove these fields by fabricating devices on nonpolar crystallographic planes brought only partial success due to the material anisotropy, larger lattice mismatch, and the difficulty to synthesize nonpolar substrates.10
In devices containing heterostructures, the difference in polarization results in a polarization charge sheet11, 12 and a surface dipole layer12 at the heterointerface. The former leads to a difference in electric field at both sides of the heterointerface. The nature of this phenomenon is well understood although the magnitude of the effect in wurtzite nitrides is still under debate.13-15 The latter leads to an electric potential jump at the interface. The surface dipole effect was identified several decades ago, although its existence as well as its magnitude is still disputed.16
In addition to these well-known effects at heterointerfaces, a different polarizationrelated phenomenon is predicted to occur in materials with chemical gradients.18 A variation of the concentration in ternary alloys leads to a variation of the polarization, which results in an electrostatic effect that is not encountered in chemically uniform materials.19 In uniform materials, the electron charge shift in an atom is compensated by the next neighboring atom, thus effective volume charge is zero except at the surface (or heterointerface) where the dipoles are not compensated and create sheets of charge. In a graded material, the dipole changes along
2

the growth axis. Therefore, the net bulk charge density arises, and this phenomenon is denoted as polarization doping. 19
Assuming that the polarization varies linearly with the alloy concentration, linearly graded materials will contain a uniform non-compensated volume charge density. For nanometer-scale systems, this charge is not screened. In that case, the electrostatic potential distribution may be used to identify the magnitude of the polarization-induced charge density.
In this work, we will verify existence of the effect by determination of the charge density induced by polarization doping in a graded concentration region via the Poisson equation. The magnitude of the effect will be calculated and a universal scaling constant for the effect, called polarization-doping charge density constant will be determined. We introduce a scaling parameter that can be used to obtain the polarization-doping charge density for any linear concentration gradient. This parameter is directly related to polarization difference, thus it depends on spontaneous polarization and the piezoelectric effects.
Ab initio simulations used the package SIESTA, with a numeric atomic orbitals base.20,21 The following atomic orbitals were used: Al - 3s: DZ (double zeta), 3p: TZ (triple zeta), 3d: DZ; N - 2s: DZ, 2p: TZ, 3d: SZ (single zeta); Ga- 4s: DZ (double zeta), 4p: TZ (triple zeta), 3d: DZ. The effective treatment of large systems is enabled by the application of pseudopotentials for all atoms, generated by the ATOM program for all-electron calculations provided by the code authors. SIESTA considers norm-conserving Troullier-Martins pseudopotentials, in the Kleinmann-Bylander factorized form.22, 23 Within the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) the PBEsol modification of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional was used.24, 25
The lattice constants of bulk AlN, obtained in calculations for a fully periodic system, were  = 3.112  and  = 4.983 . These values are in good agreement with the experimental data for wurtzite AlN obtained from x-ray diffraction measurements:  = 3.111  and  = 4.981 .26 A similar test for GaN gave  = 3.194  and  = 5.186 , in good agreement with the experimental values  = 3.1890  and  = 5.1864 .27 All the presented dispersion relations are plotted as obtained from DFT calculations by using Ferreira et al. correction scheme called GGA-1/2 approximation.28 It includes a selfenergy of excitations in semiconductors, providing bandgap (BG) energies, effective masses, and band structures in good agreement with experiments.29 Our results were obtained using GGA-1/2 correction scheme to structures in which positions of atoms and a periodic cell were first relaxed to equilibrium state by using GGA-PBEsol approximation. In geometry

optimizations, all atoms were relaxed to reduce the forces on single atoms below 0.005 eV/Å. Spin­orbit effects were neglected in present calculations, since the high-lying valence and lowlying conduction states lead to only a small amount of splitting (on the order of 10 meV). The bandgap of bulk AlN was then equal: () = 6.19  in good agreement with the experimental data of Silveira et al. (() = 6.09 30). Similarly, values for GaN were () = 3.47  and () = 3.47 , respectively.31,32 As a convergence criterion to terminate a self-consistent field (SCF) loop, the maximum difference between the output and the input of each element of the density matrix had to be equal or smaller than 10-4.

Figure 1. (a) AlxGa1-xN/AlN/GaN and (b) AlxGa1-xN/GaN/AlN supercells used in ab initio calculations. The AlxGa1-xN layer is linearly graded, with (a) increasing and (b) decreasing Al content towards the top of the cell ([000-1] direction). Al, Ga and N atoms are represented by
green, red and blue balls, respectively.

In the ab initio calculations, we use graded-AlxGa1-xN/AlN/GaN and graded-AlxGa1-

xN/GaN/AlN superlattices. The schematic view of a single period of the two structures is

presented in Figure 1. In the diagrams, the [000-1] direction points towards the top. From

bottom to top, the periods consist of:

(a) 15 atomic layers of a linearly graded ternary alloy with Al content increasing along

[000-1], 5 atomic layers of pure AlN and 4 atomic layers of pure GaN,

(b) 15 atomic layers of a linearly graded ternary alloy with Al content decreasing along

[000-1], 4 atomic layers of pure GaN and 5 atomic layers of pure AlN.

In the ternary alloy section, the metal atoms in each layer are distributed randomly, and the

number of Al atoms in subsequent layers is changed consecutively by one. The average

polarization is expected to change linearly with the metal concentration. The change in average

composition in the atomic layers is presented in Figure 2. A 4 × 4 supercell was used. Therefore

The linear polarization change should give a volume charge density (), which is related to

the curvature of electrical potential () via Poisson equation:

2() = - ()/

,

(1)

where  is the static dielectric constant of the semiconductor and  dielectric permittivity. As

the dielectric constants of AlN and GaN are approximately equal, the average constant value

corresponding to  = 0.5 is used ( = 10.295). The electric potential profile obtained by double average procedure from ab initio calculations is shown in Figure 3. The segments

corresponding to pure AlN, pure GaN and linearly graded AlxGa1-xN have different potential

profile. The sections with uniform concentration present a linear variation of the potential,

6

whereas the potential profile within the linearly graded alloy can be approximated by a parabola, which is characteristic of systems with uniform bulk charge density. In addition, at the AlN-GaN interface, a potential jump is observed, due to existence of a dipole layer.
The parabolic potential profile in the graded alloys of (a) and (b) cases can be described by () = 0 + 1  + 2 2 and () = 0 + 1  + 2 2, respectively, with 0 = 13.627 ± 0.003 , 1 = -0.067 ± 0.003 / and 2 = 0.14 ± 0.01 /2 for case (a), and 0 = 11.971 ± 0.002 , 1 = 0.126 ± 0.002 / and 2 = -0.16 ± 0.01 /2 for case (b). From these data, the bulk charge density is: (a)  = -2.54 ± 0.18 × 107 /3 and (b)  = 2.91 ± 0.18 × 107 /3.

The above-listed charge densities refer to fixed charges. The same total amount of fixed polarization-induced surface charge may be estimated using the thickness of the graded layer: (a)   35.6  and (b)   35.1 . Thus, the obtained surface charge densities are (a)  = 9.07 × 10-2 /2 and (b)  = -10.21 × 10-2 /2.
Note that the simulated systems are heavily strained, which drastically affects polarization charges via piezoelectric effects.13,14,33,34 The AlN-GaN polarization difference (-   - ) under different strain states is listed in Table 1. In the table, the "Relaxed" case is obtained as the spontaneous polarization difference between bulk AlN and GaN. The lattice constant in the system referred to as "Model strained" was obtained by elastic relaxation of the lattice in the ab initio procedure. In this case, the in-plane lattice constant evolved to  = 3.13434  and the strain along the c axis was 33 = -2 1311/33 , where 11 is the in-plane strain and Cij are elastic constants, obtained from Mahata et al.35 These results show that the strain drastically affects the polarization and consequently sheet charge density at AlN-GaN interface.

The polarization doping charge is compensated by the sheet charge density at AlN-GaN interface arising from polarization density difference. The electric fields in the chemically uniform regions of the lattice (a) are  = - = -0.072 ± 0.002 / and  = - =

8

0.062 ± 0.001 / , whereas in the lattice (b) the electric fields are:  = - = -0.069 ± 0.001 / and  = - = 0.061 ± 0.001 /. That defines the sheet charge density at the interfaces in accordance to the equation

 = (11 - 22) = 2 - 1

(2)

that gives (a)  = 1.13 ± 0.02 × 10-1 /2 and (b)  = -1.18 ± 0.02 × 10-1 /2. As

indicated in Eq. 2, these charges arise from the polarization discontinuity at AlN-GaN interface.

The obtained values are in reasonable agreement (but with opposite sign) with those obtained

by integrating the charge density in the graded layers. Therefore, the polarization doping charge

density can be related to the bulk polarization difference using the following relation:



=



()


(3)

where the concentration x is expressed in atomic fractions. In the drift-diffusion device

modeling different units are used, employing elementary charge based unit of charge and nm

as unit length. The fixed charge may be therefore expressed as density of carriers (electrons or

holes), needed to attain the charge neutrality:

=

 =


()


()


=



()


(4)

where polarization charge density parameter  can be expressed in -2. Thus, the

polarization doping charge may be characterized by polarization charge density constant .

As compensation by defects and screening are not included in these equations, the above values

set an upper limit for polarization-induced mobile charge density.

Further verification of the model was obtained by calculation of a system with reduced

concentration slope by a factor of 2 i.e. by the replacement of single Al atom by Ga atom in

every second layer. For the same graded layer thickness, the concentration slope was reduced to  = 0.120 -1. The thickness of the uniform region was also the same as that used

previously. This opens possibility of calculations of the system with a reduced Al concentration

change. Thus we consider (i) a graded-AlxGa1-xN/Al0.5Ga0.5N/GaN/ (15/5/4 atomic layers)

periodic heterostructure with x varying from 0 to 0.5 along the [000-1] axis, and (ii) a graded-

AlxGa1-xN/AlN/Al0.5Ga0.5N (15/5/4 atomic layers) periodic heterostructure with x varying from
0.5 to 1 along the [000-1] axis. The obtained parabolic coefficients were 2(2) = 0.073 ± 0.01 /2 and 2(2) = 0.065 ± 0.01/2 for structures (i) and (ii), respectively. The derived fixed charge densities are (2) = -1.38 ± 0.18 × 107 /3 and (2) = -1.18 ± 0.18 × 107 /3 that translates into free carrier densities as (2) = 8.29 ± 1.13 × 1019-3

9

and (2) = 7.38 ± 1.13 × 1019-3 for these two cases, respectively. The polarization charge density parameters are (2) = -0.688 ± 0.094 -2 and (b) (2) = -0.613 ± 0.094 -2, reasonably close to previously obtained values () = -0.577 -2 and () = -0.637 -2. For the inverted concentration Al gradients, (i) extending from x = 1.0 to 0.5 and (ii) from x = 0.5 to 0.0, the parabolic coefficients were 2(2) = 0.064 ± 0.01 /2 and 2(2) = 0.060 ± 0.01 /2. The derived bulk charge density are (2) = 1.16 ± 0.18 × 107 /3 and (2) = 1.09 ± 0.18 × 107 /3 that translates into mobile charge density (2) = 7.27 ± 1.13 × 1019-3 and (2) = 6.18 ± 1.13 × 1019-3. The polarization charge density parameters are: (2) = 0.603 ± 0.094 -2 and (b) (2) = 0.565 ± 0.094 -2.
The obtained data may be compared with experimental values. For instance, Zhu et al obtained  = 0.3 -2,36 Yan et al reported  = 0.2 -2,37 Amstrong et al measured  = 0.48 -2,38 and Li et al. obtained  = 0.33 -2.39 These experimental values are lower than those theoretically derived. The agreement between the data from the model and the direct experimental data may be assessed as reasonably good. Experimentally, the polarization-induced fixed charge is not measured directly but estimated from the resulting carrier concentration, since only mobile charge contributes to electric conductivity. Having in mind that the additional sources of carriers could contribute to screening the polarizationinduced charges, the agreement is reasonable.
Coming back to the graded-AlxGa1-xN/AlN/GaN and graded-AlxGa1-xN/GaN/AlN periodic structures described in Figures 1-3, their band profiles were calculated by a projection of band states on atom rows are presented in Figure 4. The Fermi level is located deep in the bandgap, so that the contribution of free carriers can be neglected.

charge.

If the Fermi level approaches the valence band or the conduction band, mobile charge emerges, increasing the system complexity. The system with polarization-doping fixed charge may attain local charge neutrality due to compensation by free carriers, transferred from other locations. The free carrier densities required for full compensation are (a)  = 1.59 ± 0.13 × 1020-3 and (b)  = 1.81 ± 0.13 × 1020-3, i.e. one order of magnitude higher than the Mott transition, which confirms that hole/electron conductivity may be attained for reduced alloy gradients in deep UV devices, such as UVC LEDs and LDs. In fact, the opposite mobile charge also arises due to overall system neutrality that is shifted to different location. Note that no ionized impurities (donors or acceptors) are necessary for efficient polarization doping, therefore carrier mobility is expected to be higher than in the case of impurity doping, where mobility is limited by scattering at ionized impurities. The defect based doping is different in nature because the mobile charge is compensated by the charged defects locally.
The band offset at the AlN/GaN interface cannot be obtained with sufficient precision by the present method, but it is known to be approximately 2 eV for the conduction band. The spatial variation of the valence band maximum (VBM) is less pronounced than the conduction band minimum (CBM). In the case presented in Figure 4(a), the CBM attains its lowest value at the GaN/AlN interface while VBM has its highest value in the AlGaN graded region. The mobile charge should be concentrated at these points, therefore the electron-hole separation is large. On the contrary, in Figure 4(b), the VBM attains its highest value at the GaN/AlN interface while the CBM attains its lowest value in the graded region, thus the e-h separation is similar.
In summary, this work provides atomic scale model and ab initio proof of the existence of polarization doping in AlxGa1-xN ternary alloys with graded concentration. It has been shown that in linearly graded regions, a constant bulk volume charge arise. The obtained charge density, at extremely high concentration gradients of 0.241 -1, is ,  > 1020-3, which corresponds to doping levels far above the Mott transition in III-nitride materials. Attaining this doping level with doping impurities implies a reduction of the mobility due to scattering by ionized impurities, and most often a major degradation of the structural quality of the material.
It is also shown that charge conservation and charge neutrality leads to highly nonlocal phenomena, which could be denoted as device-size compensation. The fixed charge neutrality links the polarization doping bulk charge in AlxGa1-xN graded layer with the polarization charge at the AlN/GaN interface. Thus it is subject to strong piezoelectric effects. For an AlN/GaN strained device, the charge related to difference in polarization is - = 0.92 (/2),
12

and our calculations predict that the charge derived from polarization doping is - = 0.91 (/2), which confirms this identification.
