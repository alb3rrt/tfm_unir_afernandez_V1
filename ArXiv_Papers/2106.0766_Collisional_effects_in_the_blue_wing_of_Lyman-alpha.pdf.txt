ABSTRACT Spectral observations below Lyman- are now obtained with the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It is therefore necessary to provide an accurate treatment of the blue wing of the Lyman- line that enables correct calculations of radiative transport in DA and DBA white dwarf stars. On the theoretical front, we very recently developed very accurate H-He potential energies for the hydrogen 1s, 2s, and 2p states. Nevertheless, an uncertainty remained about the asymptotic correlation of the  states and the electronic dipole transition moments. A similar difficulty occurred in our first calculations for the resonance broadening of hydrogen perturbed by collisions with neutral H atoms. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we clarify the question of the asymptotic correlation of the  states, and we show that relativistic contributions, even very tiny, may need to be accounted for a correct long-range and asymptotic description of the states because of the specific 2s2p Coulomb degeneracy in hydrogen. This effect of relativistic corrections, inducing small splitting of the 2s and 2p states of H, is shown to be important for the - transition dipole moments in H-He and is also discussed in H-H. Second, we use existent (H-H) and newly determined (H-He) accurate potentials and properties to provide a theoretical investigation of the collisional effects on the blue wing of the Lyman- line of H perturbed by He and H. We study the relative contributions in the blue wing of the H and He atoms according to their relative densities. We finally achieve a comparison with recent COS observations and propose an assignment for a feature centered at 1190 Å. Key words. star - white dwarf - spectrum - spectral line

1. Introduction
In helium-dominated white dwarfs, the discrepancy in the hydrogen abundance between Balmer- from the optical data and Lyman- from the ultraviolet (UV) data is strong. In addition, the Lyman- line profile is asymmetric (see Xu et al. 2017, and references therein). The existence of a quasi-molecular line satellite is crucial for understanding this asymmetrical shape of the Lyman- line observed with the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS) (see Fig. 1 in Allard et al. (2020)). This absorption feature has been predicted by detailed collisional broadening profiles by Allard & Christova (2009). These authors made an exhaustive study of the red wing of the Lyman- line perturbed by H-He collisions. They considered high He densities met in cool DZ white dwarfs and examined the validity range of the oneperturber approximation that is widely used to calculate the line wings. H-He potentials were theoretically determined by several authors, namely Theodorakopoulos et al. (1984), Theodorakopoulos et al. (1987), Sarpal et al. (1991), Lo et al. (2006), Belyaev (2015), and Allard et al. (2020). Allard & Christova (2009) used the potentials and dipole moments of Theodorakopoulos et al. (1984) and Theodorakopoulos et al. (1987), but were limited by a lack of accuracy of the molecular potential of the C state. They noticed an unexpected well of about 150 cm-1 at R  8 Å that is related to the choice of basis states. Signifi-

cant progress in the description of the H-He potential energies has been achieved in a recent work (Allard et al. 2020) using extensive basis sets and multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) calculations ((Knowles & Werner 1992) and (Werner et al. 2015)) to determine accurate ab initio potential energy curves. Nevertheless, because of the specific degeneracy of the hydrogen levels in the Coulomb model, the adiabatic correlation of the A and C states to either 2s (dipole forbidden from the ground state) or 2p (allowed) states is not fully characterized using the Coulomb Hamiltonian only. Relativistic effects that are smaller than 1 cm-1 for hydrogen are responsible for lifting the strict degeneracy of the hydrogen atomic levels in the Coulomb model (Kramida 2010). This level splitting is crucial for establishing the adiabatic correlation of the molecular states toward the asymptotic levels, and thus the specific asymptotic behavior of the dipole transition moments from the ground state. Thus, one aspect of the present paper is to redetermine and rediscuss the ground and lowest excited potential energy curves (PECs) of H-He and the electric transition dipole moments (Sect. 2.1), with a stronger focus on their long-distance behavior. A detailed correlation to the dissociated atomic states and its effect on the transition dipole moments is specifically discussed in Sect. 2.2. We consider spin-orbit (SO) coupling in Sect. 2.3.
A similar asymmetry as in the Lyman- H-He line profile also exists in the resonance broadening of hydrogen perturbed

onance broadening of hydrogen perturbed by collisions with H

and H+ (Allard et al. 1994), we were mainly interested in quasi-

molecular absorption of transient H2 red wing of Lyman-. Singlet states

and Werner H2 bands. Triplet states only lead to a blue asymmetry because of a close line satellite that appears as a shoul-

der in the blue wing. These improved theoretical calculations

of the complete Lyman- profile including both red and blue

wings were applied to the interpretation of International Ultra-

violet Explorer (IUE) and HST spectra. They were shown to be

fundamental in the interpretation of UV spectra of variable DA

white dwarfs (ZZ Ceti stars) (Koester et al. 1994). The analysis

of the Lyman- satellites in the far red wing is not only a way

to establish the location of the ZZ Ceti instability of variable DA

white dwarfs, but also a test of the assumptions about convection

efficiency (Bergeron et al. 1995).

The correlation diagram for H2 states contributing to Lyman shown in Table 2 of Allard et al. (1994) was not correct be-

cause of an error in the preliminary ab initio calculations of

A new correlation diagram was presented in Allard & Kielkopf

(2009) to correct Table 2 of Allard et al. (1994). This correla-

tion diagram has been used in Allard et al. (1998a) and in our

subsequent work. Electronic transition moments among singlets

and triplets computed by Spielfiedel (2003) and Spielfiedel et al.

(2004) were used in Allard & Kielkopf (2009) for an exhaus-

tive study of the red wing of Lyman- in order to determine the

the correct contribution of triplet states to the blue wing of the

Lyman- line, a blue line satellite was observed in experimental

spectra (Kielkopf & Allard 1995, 1998).

We discuss the effect of the 2s - 2p degeneracy lifting on the

long-distance behavior of H2 states in Sect. 2.4. In Sect. 3 we present a study of the blue wing of the Lyman- line perturbed

by collisions with H and He atoms in order to examine their

relative contributions in the Lyman- spectrum.

2. Diatomic potentials and electronic transition dipole moments
The transient interactions of atoms during radiative collisions are the main physical quantities needed for a good understanding of the effect of collisional processes on radiative transfer in stellar atmospheres and the spectra emitted by white dwarf stars. We consider herafter H-He with and without spin-orbit coupling and H-H.
2.1. H-He without SO coupling The ab initio calculations of the potentials were carried out with the MOLPRO package (Werner et al. 2015) using a very large Gaussian basis set that was initially taken from the spd f gh augcc-pV6Z basis set of the MOLPRO library for both He and H atoms, complemented by additional diffuse functions. On both He and H, the aug-cc-pV6Z Gaussian basis set was complemented by diffuse functions in each l manifold. The added exponents on He were the same as in the previous work of Allard

et al. (2020). A slightly larger complementary set of functions was determined and used on H in order to accurately describe the atomic spectrum of hydrogen up to n=4, with both diffuse functions and sometimes intermediate exponents improving the nodal structure (Table 4 of the Appendix). Thus the basis set includes 239 Gaussian functions on He and 297 on H.
A unique set of molecular orbitals was obtained from a relativistic Hartree-Fock (RHF) calculation of HeH+, incorporating the scalar relativistic effects (Darwin and mass-velocity contributions) within the Douglas-Kroll-Hess (DKH) scheme (Reiher 2006; Nakajima & Hirao 2011) at second order. The virtual orbitals of HeH+ provide relevant excited molecular orbitals that properly dissociate into the exact orbitals of H (as represented within the present basis). All subsequent calculations include the DKH contributions. The configuration interaction (CI) was generated by a primary complete active space (CAS) including 14, 7, 7, and 4 molecular orbitals in each of the a1, b1, b2, and a2 manifolds of the C2v point group. This ensured that all +, , , and  states dissociating up to n=4 were properly described in the CAS space. Finally, an MRCI calculation (Knowles & Werner 1992) generated from this CAS space was conducted for the A1, B1 , and A2 manifold with 13, 7, and 3 eigenstates, respectively. Although we only discuss the Lyman- contribution here, the relevant electric dipole transition moments corresponding to Lyman and Balmer transitions up to n=4 were determined in the same calculations and will be the object of future publication. Relativistic effects are obviously very tiny on hydrogen. Nevertheless, because all excited levels present degeneracy in the simple nonrelativistic Coulomb scheme, it may be important for a correct long-range description to account even for very tiny splitting.
The DKH contribution, which is essentially active in the inner parts of the wave functions close to the atoms, splits the degenerate components of a given n and stabilizes more significantly the low l levels. It also slightly increases the excitation energies from the 1s level. In the present work that is concerned with the 2s, 2p states, these scalar contributions were comple-

mented by accounting for spin-orbit coupling with similar magnitude. For all levels of H n=1-4, the use of the extensive basis set and inclusion of the DKH correction provides transition energies obtained with an accuracy better than 0.5 cm-1 compared to the experimental atomic data ( Kramida et al. (2020)). Table 1 illustrates the achieved accuracy (in particular, the ordering of the 2s,2p states) that is important to determine the configurational mixings that span the molecular states and the resulting transition probabilities that contribute to Lyman-.
The symmetry and labeling of the molecular states that dissociate into He(1s2) + H(2s,2p) is shown in Table 2, and their potential energy curves are plotted in Fig. 1. States A and B are attractive with a minimum located around R= 0.75 Å. State C2+ presents a repulsive character at medium and long range, resulting in a barrier and a shallower short-distance well depth. This medium-range repulsion is associated with the repulsion between the electronic density of the 2s and 2p hydrogen orbitals along the axis and the electrons of the helium atom.

2.2. H-He PECs and correlation to dissociated atomic states For distances smaller than 8.1 Å, the results we show in Fig. 2 do not differ substantially from the recent calculation of Allard et al. (2020), which was essentially achieved with a similar methodology. We used the same aug-cc-pV6Z basis set complemented with diffuse functions (the same functions for helium, and slightly more diffuse functions on hydrogen), and a

larger CAS space generating the MRCI (three electrons in 32 orbitals, instead of three electrons in 14 orbitals in the former work). None of these differences are expected to provide significant quantitative changes at short distance concerning the ground state and the states dissociating into H(n=2)+He. However, no explicit mention of the relativistic effects was made (Allard et al. 2020), and the C state potential energy curve was found to converge to the unique Coulomb 2s/2p asymptote with a dipole moment for the X - C transition that vanished asymptotically, meaning an adiabatic correlation of the obtained C state with the dipole-forbidden 2s atomic state. Conversely, the transition dipole moment X - A was found to converge to that of the atomic 1s - 2p transition dipole moment value.
We here focus strongly on the medium and long distance of the potential curves. In particular, at the asymptotic limit, the DKH relativistic correction lifts the hydrogen 2s/2p degeneracy, lowering the 2s state more than the 2p state. This results in a 2s-2p splitting of 0.316 cm-1. As a result, a long-distance avoided crossing around 8.1 Å occurs in the 2+ manifold between the lower adiabatic state correlated with 2s and the upper state correlated with 2p. The state correlated with 2s has a tiny well at 8.7 Å. This causes the adiabatic upper state (labeled C at short distance by spectroscopists) to correlate with the 2p asymptote, while state A is correlated with 2s. The examination of the dipole transition moments from the ground state, shown in Fig. 3, reveals a crucial implication. This long-range avoided crossing induces a kink at 8.1 Å in the dipole moment X - C and a sign change in the X - A dipole transition moment. Moreover, both adiabatic states have transition moments that stabilize around 0.4-0.6 au below R=8.1 Å, which means that the upper state loses some 2p character while the lower gains it, regardless of the avoided crossing at 8.1 Å. Thus, the situation results from a gradual 2s/2p mixing increasing with short distance, superimposed with the sharp avoidance at 8.1 Å.
2.3. H-He with SO coupling
SO coupling was incorporated following the atom-in-moleculelike scheme introduced by Cohen & Schneider (1974). It relies

where l^ and s^ are the orbital and spin-moment operators, and i is the effective spin constant associated with a given atomic electronic shell. tohfethpTeuhreeeitlgoyeteanllseHtcatatremossit(lathoteincrieaHnwaHmitheillt+toonHtaiSal nOspHisineel.xpBproreejcesascuetisdoeninthtehec=obra±esi21es)lesocef-t trons of He define a closed shell, the spin-orbit coupling between the molecular many-electron doublet states k, approximated at this step as single determinants with the same closed shell 1s2 as the He subpart, is isomorphic to that between the singly occupied molecular spin-orbitals k, which are asymptotically correlated with the six 2p spin-orbitals and two 2s spin-orbitals of H. In its original formulation, the Cohen and Schneider approximation consists of assigning these matrix elements to their asymptotic (atomic) values. However, in the case of HeH, the 2s and 2p shells are asymptotically degenerate, which offers a favorable situation for electronic mixing. As previously mentioned, both adiabatic states 2s and 2p depart from their asymptotic character. Conversely, the 2p state does not significantly mix with any other states and essentially conserves the asymptotic transition dipole moment from the ground state shown in Fig. 3.
In case of strong mixing, application of the Cohen and Schneider scheme is more relevant in a basis of diabatic or quasidiabatic states, as has been discussed in previous works (Allard et al. 2020). Thus we determined 2s and 2p diabatic states through a unitary transform of the adiabatic states 2s and 2p and the constraint that the transition dipole moments from the ground state X 12+ to the quasi-diabatic states at finite distance remain as close as possible to their asymptotic values, namely zero and 0.744 (asymptotic limit of the MRCI calculation),

Fig. 3 shows that the transition dipole moments to the quasidiabatic states are now exactly zero for state 2s and almost constant for state 2p. The two latter and state 2p = 2p considered as diabatic therefore span the Cohen and Schneider spin-orbit matrix, the electronic Hamiltonian being nondiagonal in the  states manifold,

The effective spin-orbit constant of the 2p shell of hydrogen is taken empirically as 2/3 times the spin-orbit splitting 0.366 cm-1, namely 2p= 0.244 cm-1 (Kramida et al. 2020). The total Hamiltonian matrix H = Hel + HS O for the n=2 manifold is thus an 8× 8 complex matrix that can decouple into the real matrices according to different values of  = Ml + Ms, where Ml and Ms are the orbital and spin moment projections on the molecular axis.

of the avoided crossing between the  state at 8.1 Å , it becomes

for an asymptotic shift. It should be noted that in a diabatic pic-

ture where the states may cross (but where the hamiltonian is no

longer diagonal), three 1/2 states keeping the A, B and C

character almost up to dissociation could be defined, correlated

to 2p1/2, 2p3/2 and 2s1/2 respectively after multiple crossings. The transition dipole moments (Fig. 6) between the spin-

The dipole moments of transitions X1/2 - (2)1/2 and X1/2 - (4)1/2 show kinks at 8.1 Å, while that of the X1/2 -(3)1/2 transition changes sign. This feature results from the avoided or actual crossings between their three A, B, and C parents and the consecutive multiple crossings of the spin-orbit states at this distance. The transition moment X1/2-(1)3/2 remains clearly equal to that of X - B . The dipole moments of transitions X1/2 - (2)1/2 and X1/2 - (3)1/2 furthermore show a sudden exchange at 1.2 Å due to the crossing of their parent states A and B, respectively, at that distance.
The electronic structure of HeH involving fine structure has also been investigated with pseudopotentials (Kielkopf 2021), in excellent agreement with our calculation in the region R>6 Å. Although we carried out an analysis of the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the H-He potential curves and transition moments, spin-orbit coupling is not taken into account in the collisional section below. The most important effect, namely the adiabatic correlation of the C state with the upper allowed 2p asymptote associated with a nonvanishing X - C dipole moment, is maintained when spin-orbit coupling is accounted for: the C1/2 state, spanned by the parent state C at short distance, correlates with the dipole-allowed atomic state 2p3/2, and the X1/2 - (4)1/2 transition dipole remains finite at large distance.
2.4. H-H potentials In Allard et al. (1994) the theoretical potentials for the binary interaction of one hydrogen atom with another hydrogen atom were taken from the calculations of Sharp (1971) and Wolniewicz & Dressler (1988). The dependence of the probabilities of the allowed molecular transitions on internuclear separation contributing to the Lyman- line were taken from Dressler & Wolniewicz (1985) for the singlet states and preliminary ab initio results for the transitions between the triplet states. The allowed transitions contributing to Lyman- were summarized in Table 4 of Allard et al. (1994), but the labels of the a and h triplet states were interchanged. The symmetry and labeling of the H-H states are listed in Table 2. It might be wondered whether the inclusion of relativistic terms might seriously affect the long-distance behavior of the potentials and the transition dipole moments, as found in HHe. In Fig. 7 we show the long-range behavior of the theoretical quasi-full CI H-H potentials of Spielfiedel (2001, private communication) carried out in the Coulomb framework, and MRCI calculations (full CI) conducted on H-H with the same basis set as was used on hydrogen in HHe (see above) and the DKH correction. The splitting of the 2s and 2p levels also induces avoided crossings in H2. While states h3+g and B1+u join the asymptote around 15 Å states a3+g and B1+u remain significantly attractive up to very large separation because of the 1/R3 contribution. They exhibit avoided crossings (within each symmetry manifold) with the former states (diabatically correlated with atomic forbidden asymptotes). However, in H2, these avoided crossings take place at very long distance, namely around R=45 Å. At this interatomic separation, the electronic coupling vanishes and we can consider that in a collisional situation the system will follow a diabatic behavior, namely it will move along diabatic potentials that cross. In the present case with vanishing coupling, diabatic potentials can easily be defined by reassigning the adiabatic potential values before and after the (avoided) crossing.
Because only the difference potentials are meaningful for the treatment of collisional broadening, we can infer that scalar relativistic corrections are not needed and the potentials in

The unified profiles are the Fourier transforms (FT) of the autocorrelation functions as given by Eq. (121) of Allard et al. (1999), in which the contributions from the different components of a transition enter with their statistical weights. A pairwise additive assumption allows us to calculate I(), when N perturbers interact as the FT of the Nth power of the autocorrelation function (s) of a unique atom-perturber pair. For a perturber density np, we obtain

the Coulomb description can be used simply as diabatic potentials. We therefore used the theoretical H-H potentials of Spielfiedel (2001, private communications) together with the electronic transition moments among singlets and triplets taken from Spielfiedel (2003) and Spielfiedel et al. (2004). As with HHe, spin-orbit coupling is not considered in the collisional section that follows.

3. Collisional profiles perturbed by neutral H and He atoms
Quasi-molecular lines in the red wing of Lyman-, Lyman-, and Lyman- arise from radiative collisions of excited atomic hydrogen with unexcited neutral hydrogen atoms or protons Allard & Kielkopf (1991); Allard et al. (1998b,a, 2000, 2004b,a, 2009). A general unified theory in which the electric dipole moment varies during a collision (Allard et al. 1999) is essential as the blue H-H quasi-molecular line satellite is due to an asymptotically forbidden transition b 3u  h 3g.

The unified theory (Allard & Kielkopf 1982) predicts that line satellites are centered periodically at frequencies corresponding to integer multiples of the extrema of V(R) (Eq. (9)).

The Lyman- profiles resulting from perturbation by either H-He or H-H collisions separately are overplotted (dotted lines) for ratios of 103 and 10-2, respectively. The temperature is 12000 K.

3.3. Collisional profiles simultaneaously perturbed by He and H atoms
The spectra of helium-dominated white dwarf stars with hydrogen in their atmosphere present a distinctive broad feature centered around 1160 Å in the blue wing of the Lyman- line (see Fig. 1 in Allard et al. (2020)). Figure 11 shows that this line satellite is quite close to the one due to H-H collisions centered at 1190 Å. We caused the ratio nHe/nH of their densities to vary. Line profiles that are simultaneously perturbed by H and He are computed for a ratio varying from 10-2 to 103, and the H density nH remains equal to 1018cm-3. When the ratio is 103 , the H-He line profile is identical to a pure helium profile, whereas for 10-2 , the H-He line satellite at 1160 Å is not seen. This is illustrated in Fig. 12. The blue wings of Lyman- perturbed by He or H atoms are compared in Fig. 13. The line profile calculations were made at a temperature of 12000 K for a perturber density of 1018 cm-3 of He or neutral H. An additional feature is shown in the blue wing of H-H Lyman- at 1150 Å. This feature is a

line satellite of Lyman- quite far from the unperturbed Lyman line center; it is even closer to the Lyman- line. Figure 13 shows that it is therefore necessary to take the total contribution of the Lyman- and Lyman- wings of neutral H throughout this region into account.

We reported a theoretical study of the variation of the

Lyman- profile with the relative density of ionized and neu-

tral atoms and demonstrated that a ratio of 5 of the neutral and

proton density is enough to make this line satellite appear in the

far wing (Fig. 5 of Allard et al. (2000)). The line satellite ap-

lowed us to make a temperature and gravity determination that is compatible with a fit to the FUSE observation of this object. Fig. 4 of Allard et al. (2004a) showed our fit to the HST spectrum using our adopted values for Teff = 12040 K and log g = 7.93. We extracted data from Fig. 5 of Allard et al. (2004c), where synthetic spectra in the Lyman- range are compared with a FUSE spectrum of G226-29, to show in Fig. 14 the synthetic spectrum obtained for T =12040 K and log g=7.93. G226-29 was more recently observed with HST COS under program 14076, and we overplot the spectrum of the G130M2 grating that covers 11301270 Å. The HST COS observation is noisy but consistent with
the one obtained by FUSE and fills the gap above 1180 Å where the shoulder in the blue wing of Lyman- appears. This part of
the spectrum 1180-1200 Å could not be obtained with FUSE or HST. However, we should point out that we need to divide the COS flux by a factor of  1.3 to bring it to the FUSE spectrum, we had a similar problem in Allard et al. (2004a) to fit the FUSE and IUE flux. We considered that this difference by a factor of  1.3 in the flux calibration of observations performed with two different instruments of a faint target was acceptable, but obtaining the same factor with COS would mean that the error is likely due to FUSE.

pearance is then very sensitive to the degree of ionization and may be used as a temperature diagnostic. In Allard et al. (2004a) we reported its first detection in far-UV (FUV) observations of the pulsating DA white dwarf G226-29 obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). This broad feature was also detected in the laboratory by Kielkopf et al. (2004) and observed in another variable DA star, G185-32, by Dupuis et al. (2006).
In Allard et al. (2004c) we discussed in detail how important it is to take the Boltzmann factor in absorption into account in Eq. (12), especially in stellar atmospheres for temperatures lower than 15000 K. We considered local thermal equilibrium model atmospheres with a pure hydrogen composition that explicitly include the Lyman- and Lyman- quasi-molecular opacities. For the case of G226-29 shown in Fig. 14 , we used a very high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum obtained using time-resolved HST spectra presented by Kepler et al. (2000). This comparison al-

4. Conclusions

The effect of collision broadening by atomic H and He on spec-

tral lines is central for understanding the opacity of stellar atmo-

spheres. A correct determination of the Lyman- line requires

the determination of the ground and first excited potential en-

ergy curves and the electric transition dipole moments with high

accuracy. We showed for H-He how important it is to account

for relativistic effects to characterize the long-distance behav-

ior of the potentials in detail and the avoided crossing situa-

tions. These effects, although tiny, become crucial in determin-

ing the character and the adiabatic correlation of the states, and

in particular, the behavior of the associated dipole transition mo-

ments from the ground state, because of the specific degeneracy

of hydrogen-excited states in the Coulomb model. This problem

does not seem so stringent for H+H (n=2) collisions. Due to the 1/R3 asymptotic behavior of the states that also undergo avoided

crossings, but at very large separation, in this case, the behavior

of the system is expected to be fully diabatic, except perhaps in

ultra-cold and ultra-slow systems.

Our study was conducted assuming classical motion for the

nuclei, as well as an adiabatic picture for the electronic states

during the collisional process. The so-called diagonal adiabatic

corrections (Kolos & Wolniewicz 1968; Pachucki & Komasa

2014; Komasa et al. 1999; Gherib et al. 2016), which mostly

contribute at short distance, might also be added for an im-

proved accuracy. Moreover, it should be mentioned that in the

regions in which the potential curves of different states are very

close, such as at large separation especially in the H-He case

or in short-range avoided crossing regions such as in H-H, the

Born-Oppenheimer approximation defining the adiabatic states

is likely to break down, and it might be necessary to take off-

diagonal nonadiabatic couplings and collisional branchings be-

tween the adiabatic states into account. Lique et al. (2004) took

the rotational coupling collisions into account

between states and concluded

tBha1t +utheanndonCa1diaubianticHe-Hf-

fects with respect to the adiabatic treatment were very weak in

this case. The effect of nonadiabatic couplings remains an open

question in the triplet case, which presents avoided crossings at

short distance.

The HST observations have motivated this theoretical work, in which we used accurate molecular data for both the HH (Spielfiedel 2003; Spielfiedel et al. 2004) and HHe (this work) and extended that of Allard et al. (2020). This allowed a thorough study of the atomic underlying atomic physics and accurate line profile calculations of Lyman lines perturbed by collisions with H and He atoms given here. Furthermore, it is also very gratifying to observe features that have been predicted theoretically. This was the case of the 1150 Å broad feature in the Lyman- wing of the FUSE spectrum of the DA white dwarf G226-29 and now this one at 1160 Å in the blue wing of COS spectra of DBA white dwarfs. The COS observation of G226-29 was also an opportunity to reconsider the blue wing of Lyman-. Finally, our study is a first step toward obtaining the accurate data for both Lyman- and for Balmer- that are essential for determining the hydrogen abundance correctly.
