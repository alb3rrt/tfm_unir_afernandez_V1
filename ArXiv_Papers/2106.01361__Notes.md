## Abstract

We identify time-reversal symmetry breaking mixed parity superconducting states that feature eight Majorana corner modes in properly cleaved three-dimensional cubic crystals. Namely, when an odd-parity isotropic $p$-wave pairing coexists with cubic symmetry preserving even-parity octupolar $d_{x^2-y^2}+i d_{3z^2-r^2}$ pairing, the gapless surface Majorana modes of the former get localized at the eight corners, thus yielding an \emph{intrinsic} third-order topological superconductor (TOTSC). A cousin $d_{xy}+id_{3z^2-r^2}$ pairing also accommodating eight corner Majorana modes, by virtue of breaking the cubic symmetry, in contrast, yields an \emph{extrinsic} TOTSC. We identify doped octupolar (topological or trivial) Dirac insulator as the suitable platform to sustain such unconventional superconductors, realized from an intraunit cell pairing. Finally, we argue that the proposed TOTSC can be experimentally realizable in NaCl and other structurally similar compounds under high pressure.
