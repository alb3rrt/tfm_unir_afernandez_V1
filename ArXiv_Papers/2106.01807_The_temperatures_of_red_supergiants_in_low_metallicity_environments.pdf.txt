ABSTRACT The temperatures of red supergiants (RSGs) are expected to depend on metallicity (Z) in such a way that lower-Z RSGs are warmer. In this work, we investigate the Z-dependence of the Hayashi limit by analysing RSGs in the low-Z galaxy Wolf-Lundmark-Mellote (WLM), and compare with the RSGs in the higher-Z environments of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We determine the effective temperature (Teff) of each star by fitting their spectral energy distributions, as observed by VLT+SHOOTER, with MARCS model atmospheres. We find average temperatures of TeffWLM = 4400 ± 202 K, TeffSMC = 4130 ± 103 K, and TeffLMC = 4140 ± 148 K. From population synthesis analysis, we find that although the Geneva evolutionary models reproduce this trend qualitatively, the RSGs in these models are systematically too cool. We speculate that our results can be explained by the inapplicability of the standard solar mixing length to RSGs.

1 INTRODUCTION
Red supergiants (RSGs) are an evolved state of massive stars. They have luminosities of  104.39-5.52 L (Davies & Beasor 2020), and comparing with evolutionary models (e.g. Georgy et al. 2013), a mass range of  8 - 25 M . The effective temperature (Teff) of RSGs is thought to be a manifestation of the Hayashi limit. The Hayashi limit (Hayashi & Hoshi 1961) fixes the minimum Teff of the star and its maximum radius, where the star is known to have its most extended convective region and still maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium. Theoretical predictions show a dependency of the average Teff of RSGs on their metallicity (Z) (see for instance the series Meynet & Maeder (2000); Maeder & Meynet (2001); Meynet & Maeder (2002), where stellar evolution in low metallicities has been extensively studied).
An explanation for the Z - Teff dependency of RSGs from a physical point of view was proposed by Maeder & Meynet (2001): for lower Z, the star has a lower opacity and molecular weight. This will result in a more compact main-sequence star with a smaller, hotter convective core. At the end of the main sequence, the Heburning core has a shallower potential, which corresponds to a smaller and warmer RSG. The prediction can be tested by studying the average Teff of RSGs in galaxies with different metallicities.
However, accurately measuring the Teff of RSGs is known to be problematic. Specifically, Davies et al. (2013) showed that the Teff obtained from model fits to the TiO bands (which is the most

prominent spectral feature for these cool stars) were systematically cooler than fits of the same models to the line-free continuum of the spectral energy distribution (SED). An explanation for the different Teff obtained when studying the TiO bands and the line-free continuum is provided by Davies et al. (2013). Broadly, the linefree regions in the spectrum form close to the photosphere, where the local temperature is close to the Teff (Davies & Plez 2021, accepted with minor revision). In contrast, the TiO bands can form much further out above the photosphere, where the temperature is  1000 K lower. To get consistent temperatures from both diagnostics, the model atmosphere used would have to be able to correctly predict the temperature structure from the photosphere out to many stellar radii. Davies et al. (2013) argued that 1D models provide a poor description of the outer temperature structure of RSGs. They suggested that models properly accounting for 3D radiativehydrodynamics effects could yield consistent temperatures from both diagnostics. By adding a wind to the hydrostatic atmosphere, which increases the TiO absorption whilst leaving the rest of the optical-IR spectrum largely unchanged, a simultaneous fit to the TiO bands and the line-free continuum may be obtained (Davies & Plez 2021, accepted with minor revision).
In this work, we use a Teff determination method independent of the TiO bands, by fitting the whole of the SED except the regions dominated by the molecular and line absorption (as in Davies et al. 2013). We have analysed three samples of RSGs from the Local Group neighbouring galaxies Wolf-Lundmark-Mellote (WLM), Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), to investigate the Z-dependence of the average RSG

Teff across a broader baseline than was previously studied in Davies et al. (2013). The Teff and extinctions (AV) have been obtained, as well as the bolometric luminosities (Lbol), this latter for WLM targets using synthetic and observed photometry. We also perform a population synthesis using the theoretical evolutionary tracks by Ekström et al. (2012); Georgy et al. (2013); Groh et al. (2019), and compare the observations with the predictions from the simulations to better study the Teff - [Z] dependency (where [Z] = log(Z/Z ), with respect to solar Z = 0.014).
This paper is organised as follows: chapter 2 describes the observations and data reduction. The method used is presented in chapter 3, followed by the results obtained in chapter 4 and a discussion on chapter 5, where we explore the implications of the determined temperatures and compare to simulations. Lastly, we conclude in chapter 6.
2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION
2.1 New data
We have observed several RSGs in WLM, selecting our targets from Levesque & Massey (2012). We chose the 9 brightest objects in the near-IR, which represents all RSGs in this galaxy with luminosities log(Lbol/L ) > 4.4 (see Fig. 3). Our targets are listed in Table 3. We observed each star with VLT+XSHOOTER (D'Odorico et al. 2006) in order to obtain contemporaneous spectrophotometry from the optical to the near-IR, under the ESO program number (093.D-0021(A), PI: B Davies). All stars were observed with the 5 slit to minimise slit losses, in an ABBA nodding pattern. Slit positions were defined specifically to avoid any nearby stars clashing in the dispersion direction. The total integration times were the same for each star; 2248sec, 2760sec, and 3040sec in the UVB, VIS, and NIR arms respectively. The NIR integrations were broken up into discrete integration times of 190sec to avoid saturation in the airglow emission lines. In addition to the science targets, telluric standard stars of spectral type B were observed within 1.5hrs of any science exposure. Data were reduced following the same procedure described in Davies et al. (2013).
When observing the stars from a very distant galaxy such as WLM, we cannot rule out the possibility that the RSGs observed are part of multiple systems, and other stars can contribute to the flux measured. However, at the resolution of ground-based survey imaging, we see no evidence of source confusion from abnormal colors or point spread functions. In addition, we see no evidence of hybrid spectral features (e.g. Balmer lines) in the blue, which would be indicative of an unresolved multiple system. Even with other targets being in the slit, RSGs are much brighter than anything else so the likelihood of significant contamination is small.
While performing the analysis, we found that the WLM star number 7 (WLM 07) in Table 3 has a radial velocity v = 30 km/s, while all the others are v  120 km/s . Checking their parallaxes at SIMBAD (Wenger et al. 2000), WLM 07 has 1.4307 ± 0.6966 mas (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018), while the other targets have parallaxes consistent with 0 mas (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018). Both velocities and parallaxes of WLM 07 are not coincident with the rest of the WLM targets in within the errors. Furthermore, this star has a spectral type (M3) which is much later than the others (K0-3, see Table 3). We have assumed that the target is a foreground star and not part of WLM. For these reasons, WLM 07 has been excluded from further analysis.

2.2 Archival data
For the LMC and SMC, we used the previous data from the VLT+XSHOOTER observations, under the ESO programme number 088.B-0014(A) (PI B. Davies). The observations, selection criteria and reduction steps are described in Davies et al. (2013, 2015). The stars from LMC and SMC were selected from Levesque et al. (2006) to sample the full distribution of spectral types in each galaxy (as explained in Davies et al. 2013). As a further test that our sub-sample of stars in each galaxy has a distribution of Teff representative of the entire RSG population of that galaxy, we perform the following tests: we randomly select 10 RSGs from Tabernero et al. (2018) that have the same spectral type distribution as our sample stars. For each of these 10 stars, we randomly assign a Teff based on that star Teff measurement and associated error in Tabernero et al. (2018). Next, we obtain the average Teff of these 10 randomly selected temperatures. We repeat this process 100 times for both LMC and SMC targets. Finally, we compare the results with the average Teff of the whole sample in Tabernero et al. (2018). The error in the average temperatures is calculated with the mean error of the individual stars and the standard deviation.
Checking the results in Table 1, we see that the mean value for the sub-sample distribution is within the error limits of the average temperature of the whole RSGs sample in Tabernero et al. (2018). Both results are coincident within the error limits. Therefore, we conclude that our two sub-samples of stars have Teff distributions consistent with those of the entire population in each galaxy.

3 DETERMINATION OF EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURES
We begin with a grid of model atmospheres generated with the MARCS code (Gustafsson et al. 2008). The 1D code assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), hydrostatic equilibrium, and spherical symmetry. We fixed the metallicities to be [Z]WLM = -1.0 (Urbaneja et al. 2008), [Z]LMC = -0.35, and [Z]SMC = -0.55 (Davies et al. 2015). As for the metallicity adopted in WLM, in Urbaneja et al. (2008) it is stated that previous photometric studies show WLM as having a young population in the disk, and an old metal-poor halo. By observing the red giant branch color, McConnachie et al. (2005) found a metallicity of [Z] = -1.45 with respect to solar. This result however did not take into account the contribution of the younger population. When inspecting rich-metal line spectra of A supergiants, Urbaneja et al. (2008) found an average metallicity of [Z] = -0.87 ± 0.06. The [Z]WLM = -1.0 adopted in this work is consistent with that found from analysis of WLM blue supergiants by Urbaneja et al. (2008) once the differences in the Solar abundances used in that study and ours are taken into account (see Appendix of Davies et al. 2017).
We assumed the fiducial values for the microturbulence of  = 3 kms-1 (see Davies et al. 2015). Surface gravities used are log g = -0.2 for the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), as in Davies et al. (2015), while for WLM log g = 0. The log g of the WLM stars

was found iteratively, by comparing their luminosities and temperatures determined from our analysis with the evolutionary tracks of Georgy et al. (2013). We have found gravities ranging from -0.2 to +0.4, with the majority around  0.0. The robustness of our results to these fiducial values for gravity, metallicity and microturbulence are discussed in Section 4.1. The model grid is computed between 3400 K < Teff < 5000 K in steps of 100 K, which we then interpolate into a finer grid of 20 K steps.
In addition to fitting for the best Teff, we also allow the extinction AV to vary, since this parameter can make the star appear cooler and create a large degree of degeneracy with Teff. For the MCs we use the extinction law of Gordon et al. (2003), which is specifically tuned to the interstellar medium in the direction of these galaxies. For WLM we use instead the law derived by Cardelli et al. (1989), and assume a RV = 3.1 as of the Milky Way. The robustness of this assumption is explored in Section 4.1. For the baseline (i.e. Galactic) extinction towards WLM, Schlafly et al. (2014) shows that it is very low, and consistent with zero (0  E(B-V )  0.1). Therefore, it will not influence our results. The grid of extinction parameters used is 0 < AV < 2 with a step of 0.01.
For the analysis, we fit the SED windows unaffected by line and molecular absorption as seen in Table 2, which are the same used in Davies et al. (2013). We avoid the BVR spectral region, the molecular absorption bands of TiO, VO, CO (at  1.5 µm and > 2.3 µm), and the CN band at 1.1 µ m. While Davies et al. (2013) performed a pixel-by-pixel matching of these spectral regions, we fit the mean flux of each SED window. The reason is that the SNR in the near-IR region of the WLM spectra are not high enough to do pixel-by-pixel analysis.
At each point in the model grid (i.e. for each value of Teff and AV) we adjusted the SED to the same data flux by minimising the (log(SEDmodel) - log(SEDdata)) at the line-free continuum, where log(SED) represents the base-10 logarithm of the SED flux regions, in order to compare both fluxes.. We then performed a 2parameter fit by means of a 2 minimisation, assuming Gaussian correlation as shown in eq. 1:

where n is the number of spectral regions in Table 2, SEDdata
represents the mean flux of the data for each one of the regions, SEDmodel the mean flux of the model, and i2 the standard deviation of the data in each SED region.
The result of the analysis is a 2D-array of 2, one value for
each AV and Teff. The best fit parameters correspond to those at the minimum value of the 2 2D-array.
For the errors on Teff and AV, we first determine the 68% dispersion contours of the 2 fit, that for two degrees of freedom like

the present case (Teff and AV), corresponds to all the grid models with values 2 < m2in + 2.3 (Avni 1976), where m2in is the bestfitted model. The errors on each parameter are then defined as being the minimum values within this range.
The Lbol were calculated for WLM targets using synthetic photometry and available photometry at the SIMBAD database (Wenger et al. 2000), with 2MASS (Pickles & Depagne 2010), Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018), PAN-STARSS (Chambers et al. 2016), VISTA (McMahon et al. 2013), SkyMapper (Wolf et al. 2018) and Spitzer/IRAC (Boyer et al. 2015) photometry. The magnitudes for the different filters were converted to flux, dereddened using the previously determined extinction AV, and integrated over the wavelength range for all the photometric filters available (from 0.36 µm to 7.5 µm). We transformed to bolometric luminosities using the most recent distance determination dWLM = 995 ± 46 kpc (Urbaneja et al. 2008). Dorda et al. (2016) showed that SMC RSGs display a high degree of spectral variability, finding evidence that variability increases with decreasing metallicity. Furthermore, Beasor et al. (2021) studied the effect of the variability between the minimum and maximum states of the RSGs in the stellar cluster Westerlund 1. Even when the most extreme assumptions were made, the resulting impact on the Lbol was at most ±0.2 dex. Therefore, any systematic uncertainty due to spectral variability in the stars in this work must be less than this.
To determine the error on Lbol, we propagated the errors through those on the individual flux measurements, the error on AV, as well as the distance of the galaxy. Of these, the dominant source of uncertainty is the AV.
4 RESULTS
The best Teff, AV and log(Lbol/L ) obtained after the analysis, for each object in WLM is listed in Table 3 (with the errors from the 68% 2 isocontours), as well as their stellar coordinates, apparent magnitudes, spectral types from Levesque & Massey (2012), and identification names as in the SIMBAD database (Wenger et al. 2000). Figure 1 shows the results of the analysis for one case, where we see the best fit MARCS model (upper left panel) in black with respect to the data in red, the residuals of the fit in the lower left panel. The right panel of Figure 1 shows the best fitted parameters along with the ellipse dispersion contours for the 68% confidence limit, 95% and 99.7%. The best fits for the rest of the targets can be seen in Appendix A.
In Appendix A, we see that for WLM 01, 05 and 09 there is a continuum shift for the long-wavelength edge in the observations. This is because in the last order of the NIR arm there was a variable thermal background which affected the flux calibration. To investigate the impact of this effect, we repeated the analysis shifting the fitted region at this order for these particular cases. The results did not change for the first 2 cases, and changed by -20 K in WLM 09. This does not increase the errors for these stars. Moreover, WLM 01 has an extinction close to zero of Av = 0.00 ± 1.02, but one of the biggest error budgets of all WLM stars.
Table 4 shows the calculated values with the SED method for the SMC and LMC stars, with the errors in Teff and AV from the 68% 2 isocontours. We have compared the stars with the previous results from Davies et al. (2013, 2015); Tabernero et al. (2018) in Figure 2. The results are consistent between 1 - 2 for the first two panels, the discrepancy with Tabernero et al. (2018) is discussed in Section 4.2.

with care. Checking Figure A24, we see that for LMC 136042 the observations (upper left panel, in blue) tend to upper the continuum in the spectral region of <500 nm, meaning that their flux contribution at the green-blue region of the spectra is higher than expected. This indicates that there is a blue star next to this target (GonzálezFernández et al. 2015). We excluded this target for the rest of the analysis.
The stars are placed in the Hertzprung-Russel diagram (HRD) in Figure 3, based on their Lbol and Teff. We have also plotted for comparison the 9 - 20 M rotating evolutionary tracks for RSGs taken from Georgy et al. (2013), in black solid-line showing the tracks corresponding to a Z = 0.002, comparable to the studied galaxies. The average values for the three galaxies (excluding WLM 07 and LMC 136042, for the reasons already mentioned), are:

WLM: Teff = 4400 ± 202 K,
SMC: Teff = 4130 ± 103 K,
LMC: Teff = 4140 ± 148 K,
where the errors correspond to the quadratic sum of the formal errors from the model fitting and the systematic errors arising from our assumptions when fitting the data (see Section 4.1).
With the results above we see that, as theory predicts (e. g. Maeder & Meynet 2001) there is a dependence with average Teff of RSGs on Z for WLM and the MCs. Indeed the lowest-Z galaxy shows an average temperature  250 K higher than the MCs. In the case of the MCs, we are not able to resolve a temperature difference between these two galaxies. This result agrees with previous work from Davies et al. (2015), which claimed that there is no measurable dependence of Teff on Z between the metallicities of LMC and

4.1 Robustness of the analysis
As described in Section 3, we made several assumptions in our fitting methodology. In this section, we now investigate the sensitivity of our results to these assumptions.
4.1.1 Microturbulence
To investigate the effect of varying our choice of  for the models employed, we repeated the analysis for each target with  = 2 and 4 km/s, since Davies et al. (2015) found a range of  between 2 - 4 km/s for all MCs stars. The median Teff does not change for WLM

6 G. González-Torà et al.
when assuming these  values, while for the MCs it changes in both by -10 K with  = 2, and +20 K for  = 4. We see that the effect of varying  is a factor of 10 smaller than the fitting errors. Therefore, a systematically different  in WLM cannot explain the Teff differences between this galaxy and the MCs.
In short, the choice of  makes little to no difference to our results. The reason is that  will affect the strong absorption lines of the spectra, but in this work we are studying the line-free continuum.
4.1.2 Surface gravity
We also perform the analysis with log g = -0.5 and log g = +0.5 based on the gravity range found in Davies et al. (2015). We find that for log g = -0.5 in WLM the average temperature varies by -100 K while for the MCs it varies by -40 K for both. With log g = +0.5 the variation is +80 K for WLM, +30 K for SMC, and +40 K for LMC. As a consequence, we see that the choice of surface gravity seems to make an impact on the final results in WLM, while for the MCs the variation is again smaller. As commented in Section 3, we expect the range on surface gravities to be -0.2 < log g < +0.4, with the majority around 0. This is comparable with the results from Davies et al. (2015).
To sum up, there is a stronger degeneracy when studying the effect of log g. This offset seems to be of ±80 K, but cannot explain why the Teff in WLM is  250 K higher than the MCs.
4.1.3 Extinction law
To check the robustness of the extinction law for WLM, we have performed the analysis using various values of RV from 2 to 6. The results changed by less than 30 K for RV = 2, 4 and 5, while for a extreme assumption such as RV = 6 the difference was of only +50 K. Since WLM is a metal poor environment, we also studied the effect of using a SMC-like extinction law, and found a difference on the average temperature of -20 K, all between the error limits. The best fit for AV changes a maximum of +0.09 for the extreme assumption of RV = 6, and it is within the error limits for AV.
In conclusion, the choice of Rv and extinction law makes barely any difference when determining the Teff.
4.1.4 SED continuum regions
The last assumption that needs to be checked is the choice of the SED continuum regions. We have recalculated our results with slightly different SED regions (e. g. including a continuum region at  400 nm, or varying the JHK band regions in Table 2 by  50 nm). We find that the choice of continuum windows can shift the median Teff in each galaxy by ±60 K. We interpret this error to represent the absolute level of accuracy on our results. In other words, a median Teff difference between two galaxies within 60 K would be consistent with zero.
Lastly, the choice of the SED continuum regions give a systematics of  60 K, this is smaller than the limitations obtained by the 68% dispersion contours, and can be related with the accuracy of the method.

to analyse M-K type stars, and is based on fitting the TiO spectral bands (between 500 and 800 nm). The second method is the same SED continuum fit as used for this work, but with a  = 2 km/s1. In the left panel of Figure 2 we compare our results to those of Davies et al. (2013). We notice that the star-to-star differences with Davies et al. (2013) are always in between 1 for both MCs, and there is no systematic offset. The very slight discrepancies between the results from this work (y-axis) and Davies et al. (2013) (x-axis) can be justified by the change in log g and  , as seen in Sect 4.1.
In Davies et al. (2015) the method consists of comparing the strengths of different spectral lines on the J-band with non-LTE model grids. We have used the same log g and  as in Davies et al. (2015). In the center panel of Figure 2, we can see that the results are consistent between 2 , and obtain a median offset of  60 K, which is within the level of precision obtained by the choice of SED regions in Section 4.1. Despite the two completely different methodologies employed, the agreement is excellent.
The work of Tabernero et al. (2018) differs the most from this work (right panel in Figure 2). We have calculated a median offset of  150 K between both results, ours being warmer. In Tabernero et al. (2018), temperatures are estimated by fitting spectral lines in the I-band with predictions from MARCS model atmospheres and LTE line formation.
The differences between our results and those of Tabernero et al. (2018) are twofold. Firstly, these LTE models do not include the non-LTE correction employed in Davies et al. (2015). This can account for  50 K (see Bergemann et al. 2013), assuming that the corrections in the I-band are similar to those in the J-band.
Secondly, the region studied in Tabernero et al. (2018) of the I-band overlaps with a TiO absorption band. Davies et al. (2013) showed that the MARCS models cannot simultaneously reproduce the TiO bands and the continuum (see Figure set 1 in Levesque et al. 2005 and Figure set 2 in Levesque et al. 2006). This makes continuum placement in the I-band gradually more problematic at spectral types M0 and later, as the contamination by TiO grows. Therefore, we would expect to see a trend of increasing disparity between the Teff of Tabernero et al. (2018) and those of our study with increasing spectral type. Indeed, this is what we see in Figure 4, a trend for the increasing difference between the Teff of Tabernero et al. (2018) and those of our work (Teff) as we go to later spectral types, for both LMC and SMC. Therefore, we conclude that the systematic offset in Figure 2 can at least be partially explained by this trend.

4.2 Comparison with previous studies
Davies et al. (2013) used two different methods to calculate the Teff of the same targets: the first one has been conventionally used

5 DISCUSSION
In Section 4, we have found an average Teff of RSGs in WLM warmer than for the higher Z environments of the MCs. As seen in Section 4.1, these differences cannot be explained by systematics in the fitting method. In this section, we investigate how our results compare to the expectations from stellar evolution models.
To better understand how our results compare to model predictions, we performed a population synthesis analysis. We generated a number of simulated stars ( 105) with masses of 5 - 100 M according to a Salpeter initial mass function. Then we assigned random ages, and used the evolutionary tracks of Ekström et al. (2012); Georgy et al. (2013); Groh et al. (2019) to interpolate their luminosities and Teff at that age. We disregarded stars that are not in the RSG phase or are older than their expected lifetime. We have then selected the stars with 4.4 < log(Lbol/L ) < 5.6 (following Davies & Beasor 2020) and 3000 < Teff < 5000 K, corresponding to a RSG phase and the stars in our sample. We determine the Teff distribution of the stars in the RSG phase. Figure 5 shows the histograms of the Teff from the RSGs after the population synthesis, for the case of non-rotating simulated stars with Z=0.014, 0.002 and 0.0004. As expected, we see that for higher metallicities there is a trend to lower temperatures. This trend does not change if we use a log(Lbol/L ) = 4.5 or 5 cut instead.
A clearer visualisation of this Z dependence with Teff can be seen in Figure 6: the median Teff of the simulated stars is shown with respect to their [Z], in magenta for non-rotating and in yellow for rotating simulated stars. The shaded regions show the 68% confidence limits (analogous to a 1 standard deviation). The median Teff are also shown in Figure 6 for the observations of each galaxy. Comparing the model predictions with the data, we point out the following:

Figure 5. Histograms showing the number density of simulated stars, in solid magenta bins for Z=0.014, dashed bins for Z=0.002 and spotted bins for Z=0.0004. The median temperature and error bars calculated with the observations for the three galaxies is also shown in green (SMC), blue (LMC) and red (WLM). The simulations shown are obtained for nonrotating stars.
· For all three galaxies, the RSGs appear to be warmer than the model predictions.
· The results show a similar qualitative slope in comparison with the simulations, but the models seem to be too cool, especially for the non-rotating models. This systematic offset is TeffWLM = 220 K, TeffSMC = 140 K, and TeffLMC = 250 K for rotating models, while TeffWLM = 300 K, TeffSMC = 220 K, and TeffLMC = 300 K for non-rotating. The offset is also out of the error dispersion for the LMC. The significance of this offset is discussed below.
To determine the statistical significance of the offset of the observed Teff with respect to the model predictions, we perform a Monte-Carlo (MC) test. Each MC trial is constructed as follows: firstly, for each galaxy, we randomly select N stars, where N is the number of stars observed in that galaxy (e.g. N = 10 in SMC). We note an individual star may be selected more than once per trial. Then, for each randomly selected star, we randomly assign a Teff from that star's observed probability distribution (illustrated by e. g. the right panel in Figure 1). Finally, we determine the median Teff, T eff, of the N stars. We then repeat this process 1000 times to determine the probability distribution on T eff for each galaxy.
Using Figure 6, we interpolate the simulated Teff and its uncertainty at the metallicity of the galaxy, and its corresponding error limits. Next, we calculate the probability that the model fits the data by integrating the product of the observed and simulated Teff distributions. We repeat this process for every galaxy.
For rotating models, we find a probability that the model and data agree of pWLM = 0.07, pSMC = 0.03, and pLMC = 0.01. The probability that all three galaxies are consistent with the rotating model predictions is ptotal = 10-5. For non-rotating models we find pWLM = 0.003, pSMC = 0.003, pLMC = 0.0004, and ptotal = 10-7. We conclude that the systematic offset between observed and pre-

8 G. González-Torà et al.
dicted Teff in all galaxies in this study cannot be explained by random scattering within the experimental errors.
A possible explanation to this mismatch between observations and simulations could be a breakdown in the assumptions used to simulate convection in RSGs. In 1D models, the mixing length theory (MLT) (Böhm-Vitense 1958) is the analytic approximation used to describe the 3D phenomenon of convection. It assumes that a fluid parcel can travel a distance fixed by the so-called mixing length, l, before dispersing into the surrounding material. This mixing length is usually expressed in terms of the pressure scale height, MLT = l/HP, where MLT is the mixing length parameter. This free parameter is usually calibrated using the standard solar model with a single depth-independent MLT. This solar calibrated value is used for stars of all masses, metallicities, and evolutionary phases. Indeed, the evolutionary tracks in this work by Ekström et al. (2012); Georgy et al. (2013); Groh et al. (2019) use MLT = MLT = 1.6467 for massive star models, arguing that MLT only changes to 1.6 for very high mass stars, M = 150M (Georgy et al. 2013). This variation was found by accounting for the differences in the massive stars equation of state.
However, 3D simulations of convection in low mass stars have shown that there is a strong MLT dependency on Teff and log g (e.g. Trampedach et al. (2014), where for Teff < 5000 K a MLT > 1.8 is found). Work by Magic et al. (2015) also finds a difference of  20% in the MLT depending on the mass of the star. Although these studies do not extend to the parameter ranges relevant for RSGs, they point out that the value of MLT is not independent of the mass.
Specifically studying RSGs, Chun et al. (2018) adopts the approach of tuning MLT to match the locations of RSGs in a range of metallicity environments. Regardless of which RSG temperature scales are used, they argue for a metallicity dependent MLT. Moreover, Dessart et al. (2013) studies the supernova type II-P (SN IIP) progenitors, varying the parameters (e.g. mixing length, overshoot, rotation, metallicity) in the stellar evolution code MESA STAR. They find that the RSG radii should be reduced in comparison with Levesque et al. (2005), implying that the Teff of RSGs should be higher than the Levesque et al. (2005) temperature scale.
The previously described work, in combination with our results presented in this study, are part of a growing body of evidence that the assumption of a solar mixing length parameter is not adequate to explain the locations of RSGs in the HRD as a function of metallicity.

Figure 6. Plot showing the temperature trend with respect to the metallicity ([Z]), in yellow for rotating simulated stars, and magenta for non-rotating. The error limits in the trend are calculated using the 68% dispersion of the cumulative distribution for the skewed histograms. The median temperatures and error bars calculated with the observations for the three galaxies are also shown in green (SMC), blue (LMC) and red (WLM).
6 CONCLUSIONS
We have analysed a total of 28 RSGs observed with VLTXSHOOTER from the neighbouring galaxies LMC, SMC and WLM, by fitting the flux of the SED regions free from molecular features. Our main conclusions are as follows:
· We find an average RSG Teff for WLM which is  300 K warmer than that in either of the MCs. This trend of increasing average Teff with decreasing Z is in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions.
· From population synthesis analysis, we find that there is a systematic offset between expected and observed temperatures of RSGs at all metallicities. Specifically, RSGs in evolutionary models are too cool by  200 K. This could be due to a wrong estimation of the mixing length parameter for 1D models of massive stars.
