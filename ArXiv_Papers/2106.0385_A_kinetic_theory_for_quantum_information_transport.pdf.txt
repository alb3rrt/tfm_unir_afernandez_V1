INTRODUCTION.
The study of transport phenomena is crucial to harness the dynamical properties of natural systems. In this sense, transport theories are phenomenological descriptions of the nonequilibrium behavior of a system. Wellknown examples are the theories of transport of charge, mass and heat. Most of them were originally formulated to understand macroscopic phenomena like (in the case of mass transport) the tendency of a system to transfer mass, in order to minimise the concentration difference. Over time, they were put on more rigorous ground using statistical mechanics and kinetic theory. Most notably, Boltzmann used this approach to describe the behavior of gases, and explain the rise of macroscopic irreversibility from the underlying time-symmetric classical mechanics. After Boltzmann's work, the core idea of treating motion and interaction in a statistical way has led to innumerable advances, both of fundamental and applied nature. With the rise of quantum theory, these techniques have also been adapted to include quantum fluctuations, leading to improved descriptions of transport phenomena at the nanoscale. While nowadays the use of kinetic and transport theories is ubiquitous, these techniques have not been leveraged to study quantum information in closed and open quantum systems. Thus, in this work, we attempt to lay a bridge between the field of quantum information and that of transport theories. More accurately, here we provide a self-consistent theory to track the dynamical evolution of a quantum state (and its probability distribution) in nonequilibrium quantum systems. We do so by building a kinetic theory of quantum state evolution, on the quantum state space, both in closed and open configurations.
At the technical level, this is done by leveraging recent work [1, 2] on Geometric Quantum Mechanics: a differential-geometric approach to quantum mechanics that gets rid of the phase redundancy of the Hilbert space. The geometric formalism maps the Hilbert space onto a space of pure states that has the structure of a

classical phase-space, with canonically conjugated coordinates.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section I we give a brief summary of GQM, and of the tools introduced in [1, 2], both of which are needed. In Section II we give the first result: a microscopic derivation of the continuity equation for the information transport in quantum systems, with appropriate, microscopic definitions for phenomenological quantities such as fluxes and sink/sources terms. In Section III we give the second result: a general equation of motion for the probability distribution to find an open quantum system in one of its pure states states. In Section ?? we provide a few concrete examples, supported by numerical analysis. Eventually, in Section VI we provide a quick summary and draw some conclusions.
I. GEOMETRIC QUANTUM MECHANICS
References [3­21] give a comprehensive introduction to GQM. Here, we briefly summarize only the elements we need, working with Hilbert spaces H of finite dimension D. For the details of the derivations, we send the reader to the literature cited above. Given an arbitrary basis {|en }Dn=-01, a pure state is parametrized by D complex homogeneous coordinates Z = {Zn}, up to normalization and an overall phase:
D-1
| = Zn |en .
n=0
Here and throughout the paper we will always use upper indices to identify different coordinates of the same point and lower indices to identify different point. This description is redundant since we can renormalize Z by multiplying it for a real number and a phase (hence a complex number) and we would get the same physical situation. Therefore, Z  CD, Z  Z, and   C/ {0}. This equivalence relation means pure states of a quantum are points in the complex projective manifold P (H) = CPD-1. If the system consists of a single qubit, for example, one can always use probability-phase

Observables and POVMs. An observable is a function O(Z)  R that associates to each point Z  P(H) the expectation value | O | / | of the corresponding operator O on state | with coordinates Z:

O(Z) =

,

where O is Hermitian O, = O,.

Measurement outcome probabilities are determined

by positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs)

{Ej}Dj=1 applied to a state [22, 23]. They are nonneg-

ative operators Ej  0, called effects, that sum up to the

The quantum state space P(H) has a preferred metric

gF S--the Fubini-Study metric [13]--and an associated volume element dVF S that is coordinate-independent and invariant under unitary transformations. The geometric

derivation of dVF S is beyond our immediate goals here.

That said, it is sufficient to give its probability-phase coordinate system

Notice how p0 and 0 are not involved. This is due to

P(H)'s projective nature which guarantees that we can

choose a coordinate patch in which p0 = 1 -

and 0 = 0. As we will see now, these coordinates play a

particular role: they are canonically conjugated.

State-space structure. Beyond the Riemannian structures, it can be shown that P(H) also has another interesting geometric feature: a symplectic structure. This is the hallmark of classical state spaces and justifies the use of the term quantum state space for P(H). With a more common jargon, a symplectic structure is the geometric entity allowing us to define "Poisson Brackets" and the existence of canonically conjugated coordinates. In particular, using probabilities and phases coordinates {(pn, n)} one has that {pn, n} = 1 nm. Thus, for ar-

Unitary evolution. In QM, an isolated quantum system

evolves with a unitary propagator U (t, t0) = e- i H(t-t0), where the generator H is the (time-independent) Hamil-

tonian of the system. Surprisingly, it can be shown [?

] that this evolution is equivalent to a classical Hamil-

tonian dynamics, with geometric coordinates. In par-

ticular, calling E(pn, n) = (pn, n)| H |(pn, n) the

Here the analogies with classical Hamiltonian mechanics are particularly evident. While quantum mechanics is clearly very different from its classical counterpart, at a certain descriptive level we can still use the intuition of classical mechanics to understand the unitary evolution of quantum systems. Thus, as we do for classical mechanics and statistical physics, we continue by introducing probability distributions on the quantum state space.
Geometric quantum states. The geometric framework makes it very natural to view a quantum state as a functional encoding that associates expectation values to observables, paralleling the C-algebra formulation of quantum mechanics [24]. The idea is that one considers probability density functions on P(H) (as q(Z)), together with observable functions (as O(Z)).
States are functionals P [O] from the algebra of observables A to the real line:

Pq[O] =

q(Z)O(Z)dVF S ,

(6)

P (H)

where O  A, q(Z)  0 is the normalized distribution associated with functional P :

Pq[I] =

q(Z)dVF S = 1 ,

P (H)

and Pq[O]  R. In this way, kets |0 are functionals

3

with a Dirac-delta distribution p0(Z) =  [Z - Z0]:

P0[O] = (Z - Z0)O(Z)dVF S
P (H)
= O(Z0) = 0| O |0 .

(Z - Z0) is shorthand for a coordinate-covariant Diracdelta in arbitrary coordinates. In homogeneous coordinates this reads:

(Z

Z0)

:=

1 
det gF S

D-1
(X n
n=0

- X0n)(Y

- Y0n)

,

where Zn = Xn + iY n. In (pn, n) coordinates this becomes simply:

D-1
(Z - Z0) = 2(pn - p0n)(n - n0) ,
n=1
where the coordinate-invariant nature of the functionals Pq[O] is now apparent. Extending by linearity, mixed states

 = j |j j|
j
are convex combinations of these Dirac-delta functionals:

qmix(Z) = j(Z - Zj) .
j
Thus, expressed as functionals from observables to the real line, mixed states are:

Pmix [O] = j j | O |j .

(7)

j

Equipped with this tools, one identifies the distribution q(Z) of Eq. (6) as a system's geometric quantum state. This is a generalized notion of quantum state.
A simple example of a geometric quantum state is the geometric canonical ensemble:
q(Z) = 1 e-h(Z) , Q
where:
Q = dVF S e-h(Z) ,
h(Z) = (Z)| H |(Z) ,
and H is the system's Hamiltonian operator. This was introduced in Refs. [25]. References [26] and [2] investigated its potential role in establishing a quantum foundation of thermodynamics that is an alternative to that based on Gibbs ensembles and von Neumann entropy.

Density matrix. The connection between geometric quantum states and density matrices is fairly straightforward. Since density matrices are a synthetic way of collecting probability outcomes about POVMs, which are functions of the form A(Z)  n,m AnmZnZm, given a generic geometric quantum state q(Z) the associated density matrix q can be simply computed as follows:

qmn = Pq[ZmZn]

= dVF S q(Z) ZmZn .

(8)

P (H)

Owing to the specific form of POVMs on P(H), recall Eq. (2), they are sensitive to q(Z) only via q. Therefore, if two geometric quantum states q1 and q2 induce the same density matrix q1 = q2 , then all POVMs produce the same outcomes.
The GQS of an Open Quantum System. As shown above, if a system is in a pure state its GQS is simply a Dirac delta concentrated on a single point. However, if the system is in contact with an environment, this is not true anymore, unless they are exactly in a product state. In general, contact with the environment causes the loss of information about which region of the state space the system inhabits. Hence, we need a probability distribution for the state of our system: a geometric quantum state. The explicit derivation of the generic geometric quantum state for an open quantum system can be found in Ref.[1]. Here we simply give the result, without discussing the derivation. Given a system and its environment, we call {|aj }dj=S-0 1 a basis for the Hilbert space HS of the system (dimension dS) and {|bn }dnE=0 a basis for the Hilbert space HE of the environment (dimension dE). Assuming system and environment are in a pure state |SE = j, j |aj |b , the geometric quantum state of the system is

Here x is the probability that the environment is in state |b and {| } is a set of dE states of the system which constitutes the discrete support of the geometric quantum state. The geometric quantum state in Eq.(9) provides the correct reduced density matrix of the system S(SE) =  x | |.
Probability mass in a region of the state space. Before we proceed with the main result, we introduce here a notation that will be useful later. This is imported from

µt(A) = qt(Z)dVF S

(11)

A

µt(A) quantifies the probability that, at time t, our quantum system is in a state Z that belongs to the region A of the quantum state space P(H). In this sense, this is the core quantity that conveys how much information about the system is contained in a certain region A of the state space.

II. INFORMATION TRANSPORT: CONTINUITY EQUATION
In the past section we have summarized previous results about GQM. We now build on them and, by bringing in the dynamics of the system, we derive a continuity equation which dictates how the geometric quantum state of a non-equilibrium open quantum system evolves, under very general assumptions. This is the fundamental kinetic equation governing how the information about the state of a quantum system changes as a result of its interaction with an environment. Throughout this section we will try to maintain a fairly general language, to emphasize how the treatment applies to quantum systems under very general assumptions. However, for concrete examples we will always refer to the simple case of a

General treatment
The following treatment pertains quantum systems which are finite-dimensional, and interact with finitedimensional environments. Other than that, we continuity equation holds for arbitrary quantum systems. Given an initial geometric quantum state, this is specified by two sets of quantities: {x}dE=-01 and {}dE=-01, which is a short-hand notation for  = Z(| ). The first one is a classical probability distribution resulting from hypothetical measurements on the environment. For each of the x there is a corresponding pure state that the system inhabits:   P(HS), which corresponds to the ket | . Since these are points moving in a state space (t), we can think of them as particles on a classical phases space, which interact in a nontrivial way. These are the "carriers of information", in the sense that each of these particles carries a probability mass x(t) that the system will be found on the state (t). A clarifying example of how the geometric quantum state of a qubit evolves when the system interacts with an environment is given in Figure 1. Since the total amount of information has to be preserved, µt(P(H)) = P(H) qt(Z)dVFS =  x(t) = 1, the geometric quantum state qt(Z) must satisfy a continuity

Figure 2. Kinetic interpretation of the flux J. If we look at a small region of the quantum state space, due to the underlying dynamics we see that information is locally conserved in the sense that there is a certain number of points which enters and leaves this region. As a result of this local process, probability is moved around and can concentrate in a certain region or get scrambled across the quantum state space.

Figure 3. Kinetic interpretation of the sink/source term t. Even if the points do not move around the quantum state space   = 0, the term t allows the exchange of information between different regions. Note that this can be a non-local effect, as depicted above. In the example above we have two state  and  fixed in time, but exchanging a certain amount of probability, thus moving information from one region of the state space to another one: x(t + t) = x(t) + , x(t + t) = x(t) - .

equation. Conceptually, this is the starting point of virtually all transport theories, which deal with quantities that are globally conserved, but that are moved around as a result of the underlying dynamics.
Thus, the dynamics of a geometric quantum state has two different terms, arising from the time-evolution of these two sets of quantities. By looking at Figure 1 we can see that there are two different ways in which the geometric quantum state changes in time. First, there is the color of each particle, which changes over time: x  = 0. Second, there is the pure movements of each point:   = 0. By summing each term over all particles, and then summing the two terms, we get the following evolution equation for the geometric quantum state:

qt(Z) = t

x ~ (Z - ) - x (Z - )   . (12)



Here  is the first distributional derivative of the dirac delta distribution. The second term in the right-hand side can be written as a covariant divergence1, since every dipendence on the coordinate Z is inside the delta distribution:

x (Z - )   = ( · Jt)(Z)

(13)



This allows us to identify the first functional term of the continuity equation, the flux of information J(t), which

is a weighted average of the "single-particle" flux J(t):

J(t) =  (Z - (t))  (t) ,
J(t) = x(t)J(t) .


(14a) (14b)

We now look at the first term in the right-hand:  x (t)(Z - (t)). This is identified to be a
source/sink term, which is independent on the underlying movement of the points in the quantum state space. This identifies the second functional term of our continuity equation: sinks and sources of information t(Z):

dE

t(Z) = x (t) (Z - (t)) .

Eventually, we obtain the following continuity equation for the geometric quantum state of a finite-dimensional quantum system interacting with a finite-dimensional environment:

t

(16)

This is our first result. A crucial aspect here is that this theoretical framework allows us to talk about information as a physically localized (and overall conserved) quantity, which is carried around by points in quantum state space. This is in analogy with the classical theories of information, which deal with properties of particles such as mass or charge, which are carried around by particles, represented as points wondering in a classical phase-space.
To reinforce this point, the physical interpretation of the flux Jt and source/sink t term is essentially the same as in other transport theories. We now describe them ex-

6

plicitly, together with their kinetic interpretation, drawn in Figures 2 and 3. First, Jt is an information flux, in the proper sense of flux. As one can appreciate in Figure 2, this flux is associated to an overall conserved quantity, localized in its carriers , which move around and distribute it across the quantum state space. To emphasize this point we look at the simpler situation in which x  = 0. In this case, the information carried around by the points in state space is a constant of motion (x(t) = x(t0)). However, as the carriers move around, the information is still dispersed across the quantum state space. Second, the term t is a proper source/sink term, with the usual interpretation. Indeed, we note that it can not be written as a divergence term. To emphasize this point we look at the simpler dynamics in which the position of the points in P(H) does not change:   = 0. In this case the support of the distribution is fixed and the particles don't move (t) = (t0). However, even in this case there can still be a non-trivial dynamics, due to x (t) = 0. Moreover, as depicted in Figure 3, the time-evolution generated by this term is generally non-local in the quantum state space. Thus, t possesses all the hallmarks of the standard sinks and sources terms in transport theories: it is not associated with particles moving around the state space and it can not be rewritten as a divergence term.

Closed quantum systems

What happens when the system is closed? Is there a specific form for the information flux Jt and source t? Here we answer both these questions in a detailed manner. Since the evolution is Hamiltonian, we can use Hamilton's equations of motion to derive the evolution equation of µt or, equivalently, of qt(Z). First, the sink/sources terms is trivially zero, as the evolution is Hamiltonian and preserves the local probabilities. Second, starting from the definition of the flux in Eq.(14), we can explicitly write the form of the flux Jt, using Hamilton's equations of motion. Writing  in canonical coordinates (pn(), n()), we have

  = pn(), n() n

1 E E

=

,- n pn

= vH (pn, n)
n

(17)

Note how the right-hand side, which we called vH does not depend on the index  anymore: all the points evolve in the same way, following the same Hamiltonian flow. Inserting this into the definition of the flux we obtain that the flux is equal to the product between the distribution and the Hamiltonian velocity field vH :

Jt(Z) = qt(Z)vH (Z) ,

(18)

thus providing the following continuity equation:

qt t

=

-vH

· qt

-

qt  ·

vH

(19)

This can be further simplified by noting that the Hamil-
tonian vector field is divergence free,  · vH = 0. This is due to the smoothness of E(pn, n) which, via Schwarz's theorem, implies that the Hessian of E(pn, n) is symmetric.

This leads us to the final form of the continuity equation of an isolated quantum system:

Liouville's theorem for GQM. As a further point of contact with the techniques of classical statistical mechanics and kinetic theory, we now show that a generic Hamiltonian dynamics for the geometric quantum state satisfies Liouville's theorem [? ]. Indeed, by writing explicitly the total derivative of qt(Z) with respect to time we get

dq =

qt dp + qt d + qt

Inserting Hamilton's equations of motion (Eq. (5)), and then using the continuity equation

dq =

(22)

This concludes the section about the general approach, and the treatment of isolated quantum systems. We now turn to the more involved case of an open quantum system.

Discussion
III. KINETIC THEORY OF INFORMATION TRANSPORT IN OPEN QUANTUM SYSTEMS
As we move to analyze how open quantum systems move information around the quantum state space, the goal of this section is to provide a microscopic approach to the transport of information: a kinetic theory of how the information about the state of a quantum system changes as a result of its interaction with a structured, non-thermal, environment. Thus, the main outcome of

7

this section is a concrete set of microscopic equations that determines the evolution of the geometric quantum state in a non-Hamiltonian setting.
Calling HS and HE the Hamiltonian operators of the system and environment, respectively, the total Hamiltonian of the joint system is H = HS + HE + Hint. Since Hint is the interaction term between system and environment, we can always put it in the form

M
Hint = A(k)  B(k) ,
k=1

(23)

where A(k) and B(k) are operators with support on HS and HE, respectively. With a slight abuse of notation we will often conflate A(k) with A(k)  IE and B(k) with IS  B(k), where IS and IE are, respectively, the identity operator on HS and HE. Here we do not make a specific choice for the basis of the system and environment.
While an obvious one is to choose the bases that diag-
onalize the non-interacting Hamiltonians HS and HE, there are cases where this is not required. For example,
in the case of a spin-1/2 chain one might be interested in
using the computational basis. Thus, we keep things gen-
eral and use a generic basis, with no particular properties with respect to the algebra of observables: {|aj }dj=S 0 and {|b }dE=-0 1.
Since the goal is to derive a dynamic equation for {x(t)} and {(t)}, we begin with the overall Schroedinger equation for the pure state |(t) of the joint sys-
tem+environment, written in the generic tensor product
basis defined above, with j(t) = aj, e|(t) :

i dj(t) = dt

We now collect the probability x(t) and the states

quantity: HS. By

a non-normalized ket plugging Schroedinger's

equation into the time-derivative of |(t) we get the

(26)

where M^ is a set of operators acting on the system,

defined as

M

M^  =

B(k)A(k)

k=1

(27)

This can be further manipulated to separate the non-
interacting part, acting on each vector | , from the interacting part, acting on | = | . The final form of our kinetic equation is

i

(28)

where the single-particle Hamiltonian is H^ is

k=1

(29)

and the interaction between particles is vehiculated by the set of operators V^

M
V^ := (HE ) IS + B(k)A(k) .
k=1

(30)

The remaining step is to connect this with the quantities

that determine the geometric quantum state of the sys-

tem: x and . This is easily done by using the original definition | = x | . Since (t)  | , we have

j(t) =

aj |(t)
x (t)

and x(t) =

(t)|(t) .

This is a set of dE coupled, linear, differential equations, for the non-normalized states | . The emergence of this set of coupled equation also reinforces the

interpretation of these points in state space as behaving

as "particle-like", with their own local notion of energy, represented by H and their pair-wise interaction V^.
While not treated here, by using the approach devel-

oped in Ref.[1] these results can be extended to include

finite-systems interacting with infinite-dimensional envi-

ronments.

As a consistency check, we note that the preservation of
information within the quantum state space of the system
is inherited by the unitarity of the global evolution. This is manifested in the relations H^ = H^ and V^ = V^, both of which can be easily shown to be true from the
definitions above.

IV. SYSTEM 1: ISOLATED QUBIT
So far we have developed the microscopic, kinetic, equations regulating the information transport across the quantum state space. In this section, using an analytical and numerical approach, we explore the tools defined above to look at the phenomenology of information transport in concrete physical systems. In particular, in our examples we look at the information transport in the state space of a qubit, both in isolated and open configuration. This choice is made to support the theoretical calculations with visual representations, both of which are simpler in the case of a qubit.

a probability mass x, which is the probability to find the system in a state . Thus, we think of it as an information carrier,

moving the information about the state of a quantum system around the quantum state space. After 60/70 time steps the

distribution settles on an equilibrium distribution. A full video of the dynamical evolution is available here.

State space of a qubit: Canonical coordinates

Before we begin our case studies, here we collect use-

ful technical details about the geometric quantum me-

chanics of a qubit. Then, using as a reference basis an

arbitrary basis {|0 , |1 } the (probability,phase) coordi-

nates are identified via the Hilbert space s|

=thespcsaeliars

product , with s

operation on = 0, 1, giving

(p0, 0, p1, 1). However, the quantum state space gets

rid of two fundamental redundancies in this description.

First, we can always assume that 0 = 0. Second, due

to normalization we have p0 = 1 - p1. Thus, we only

have a pair of independent coordinates: (p1, 1). We can

therefore drop the index and say that a general point

on the state space of a qubit is uniquely identified by

(p, ) space

 [0, 1] × [0, defined by

Hilbert |1 . In

analogy with the Bloch sphere, we call the square rep-

resentation of CP 1 the "Bloch square". Note that the

embedding is smooth everywhere, aside for two isolated

points |0 and |1 , where  is not defined and which

are represented only by p = 0 and p = 1, respec-

tively. These coordinates (p, ) are canonically conju-

gated: {p, } and the determinant of the Fubini-Study

Our first case study is an isolated qubit, with an arbitrary initial geometric quantum state f0(p, ) and Hamiltonian operator H = B · m = E0 |E0 E0| + E1 |E1 E1|, with B an arbitrary 3D magnetic vector field and m = 2  and  are the Pauli matrices. Thus, the generator of the geometric evolution is:

E(p, ) = (p, )| H |(p, ) = (1 - p)H00 + pH11

+ p(1 - p) eiH01 + e-iH10

where

S = m = 2 p(1 - p) cos , 2 p(1 - p) sin , p 2

Since the evolution is Hamiltonian, there is no source or

We now come to writing explicitly the flux Jt = (Jtp, Jt). As argued above, with Hamiltonian evolution the flux is
the product between the Hamiltonian vector field vH and the geometric quantum state ft(p, ). Explicitly:

Its solution is given by the propagator P (t, t0) =
Exp [-(t - t0) {E, ·}]. Since E = h · m and, by using the algebra of poisson brackets, one can prove that m = 2 (Sx(p, ), Sy(p, ), Sz(p, )) are the generators of SO(3):

{ma, mb} = abcmc ,

(37)

here we recognize that the propagator P (t, t0) implements a 3D rotation of the generic expectation value
m(t) around the axis B, with angle ||B||(t - t0). In more physics-agnostic terms, this is a linear, first-order, partial differential equation, which can be solved in full generality by using the method of the characteristics. Here we simplify the treatment by switching to coordinates aligned to the convenient basis in which the Hamiltonian is diagonal. This leads to

ft -  ft = 0 ,

where  = E1-E0 . This is equivalent to the transport

equation for advection, or heat equation, which leads to the analytical solution for the time-dependent geometric quantum state: ft(p, ) = f0(p,  + t), for any valid initial distribution f0(p, ).

Discussion

The evolution of a isolated qubit is periodic this ap-

pears in the evolution of its geometric quantum state as

f0(p,  + t). Crucially, as the distribution changes over time with a Hamiltonian evolution, it does so in a rigid

fashion, never changing its shape. This can, indeed, be

seen explicitly. Say that, at t = 0, the geometric quan-

tum state is made by a convex sum of dirac deltas con-

centrated on a certain number N of points  = (p, ):

q0(p, ) =

N =1

2

[p

-

p]



[

-



].

The evolution

of the geometric quantum state is therefore dictated by

how the points Z(t) change over time. Since, however, the evolution can be written as a linear change in

the  coordinate (t) = (0) + t, this translates into

(t) = (0) - t, with p(t) = p(0). As a result, the shape of the distribution never changes as the rela-

tive distance between the points (t) does not depend

on time. Calling dF S(·, ·) the Fubini-Study distance, we have

cos dF S(p, ; p, ) := 1 - (p + p) + pp
1/2
+ p(1 - p) p(1 - p) cos( - ) , (39)

giving
dF S((t), (t)) = dF S((0), (0)) ,  . (40)
Since Hamiltonian evolutions can generically support folding and stretching in state space, causing chaotic behavior, we conclude that this is not the most generic Hamiltonian evolution a qubit state space can support. Note that this goes beyond the assumption of a timeindependent Hamiltonian. Even with time-dependent Hamiltonian, this aspect of the isolated evolution of a qubit still holds true. A second point we highlight here is that, since the evolution is Hamiltonian, the entropy of the geometric quantum state, i.e. the entropy of ft(p, ) does not change as a function of time.

V. SYSTEM 2: QUBIT IN ISING ENVIRONMENT

with B a homogeneous magnetic field. Here, since the number of points in quantum state space is 2Lenv , where Lenv is the size of the environment, solving the equations of motion analytically becomes unfeasible, and we resort to a numerical approach, in which we can directly evaluate physical quantities of interest, such as the information flux, the sink/source term and the entropies of the various distribution involved. In our numerical analysis, at t = 0 the system and the environment begin in a product state, in which the state of the system is |1 . Hence, the geometric quantum state is a dirac delta distribution, concentrated on the north pole. However, as time goes by, the overall pure state is not a product anymore and we end up with a non-trivial geometric quantum state, whose evolution is dictated by Eq.(28) or, at the phenomenological level, by the continuity equation. We can map the evolution of the geometric quantum state on the surface of the Bloch sphere, as done in Figure 1 for example, or using (p, ) coordinates, on the Bloch square.

Anti-Ferromagnetic example
In Figure 4 we show the evolution of the geometric quantum state of a qubit with an environment of 12 other qubits, all interacting with an Ising Hamiltonian with Jz = 1, B = (1, 0, 0.5) and with an initial uniform product state | . . .  . Here we can see that the geometric quantum state, while initially localized, quickly spreads around to reach an equilibrium distribution. It is, however, interesting to see that it reaches equilibrium with a highly regular fashion. Here we can see that for t  0 most points (t) are organized three clusters of states which are quite close to each other. As time goes by, each of this cluster tri-furcates into smaller clusters of less points. After this splitting occurs a certain number of time we loose track of the clustering and the distribution reaches an equilibrium configuration. We believe this to originate from the structure of interactions between the points, hence to the matrix V^. In particular, be believe this to originate from the fact that there are two nearest neighbors which dicate the interaction. Increasing this number would result in a more detailed splitting, increasing the number of sub-clusters. To confirm this, we performed the same exact simulation, with a next-to-nearest neighbor Ising model, observing the formation of 5 sub-clusters at each splitting. A phenomenon we can call "penta-furcation". This suggests the number of new subclusters nsc to be equal to the number nint of qubits our system interacts directly with: nsc = nint. While we do not have a definitive explanation for this

phenomenon, it has a distinct, and unexpected, fractal flavor which deserves further investigation.

After a transient of 60/70 time-steps we can see that the

distribution settles on an equilibrium configuration that

is almost flat. This can be seen by looking directly at the

distribution of information contained in a certain region

of the state space. By discretizing the Bloch square, and

therefore CP 1, via its canonical coordinates, we can in-

tegrate the geometric quanutm state on the small cells,

track their evolution and extract a phenomenological evo-

lution equation. Given a certain number NpN of de-

sired cells Cik =

Given a geometric quantum state qt(Z), the probability

mass in each cell is µik(t) = Cik qt(Z)dVF S. By integrating the continuity equation (Eq.(16)) over a cell Cik

and using the divergence theorem we get the following

equation:

Fik

=

ik

,

(43)

where

ik(t) = dVF St(Z)
Cik

(44)

Fik = dVF S · Jt .
Cik

(45)

Using the divergence theorem, we can turn Fik into an integral over the surface Cik of Cik:

Fik = Jt · ndSF S = ik(Jt) ,
 Cik

(46)

where n = (np, n) is the vector orthogonal to the boundary of Cik and dSF S is the surface element. This quantity, Fik = ik(J) is the flow of probability mass across the boundary of each cell Cik due to the underlying movement of the points (t). On the other hand, ik(t) quantifies the probability mass that is produced or sinked in Cjk. Beyond the initial transient, as the distribution settles on
a more regular behavior, we expect a more regular evo-
lution equation to emerge. In particular, we expect two
emergent behavior. First, we assume the sink/sources
term to be zero after a short transient ik  0. This implies that the evolution is guided only by the flux term,
leading to a local conservation of probability mass. Thus,

12

we can now build a microscopic, particle-like, model for
ik(Jt). Since probability mass is locally conserved, the only way Cik can loose or gain probability mass is by exchanging particles with its immediate neighbors: Ci±1,k and Ci,k±1. Thus, as first approximation, we assume there is a fixed rate of gain and loss of particles, in each
direction (p, ): p and . This leads to the following phenomenological model for the evolution of µik(t):

dµik dt

= p (µi+1,k + µi-1,k) +  (µi,k+1 + µi,k-1)

- lossµik .

(47)

The first two terms represent the gain due to a certain

number of particles entering from either from the p or the

 direction. The last term represents the loss due to a

certain number of particles leaving Cik for one of its four adjacent neighbors. By assuming that all cells are equal,

unless otherwise specified, this leads to loss = 2(p +). This model leads to a simple diffusive behavior that,

while not entirely accurate, clearly captures the essence

of the evolution beyond the transient. While finite-size

fluctuations in time are to be expected, as we increase the

size of the Ising environment we expect them to be less

relevant, and our model more accurate. A full analysis

of the phenomenology of this model will be carried else-

where. Here we are interested in proving that this theo-

retical framework can lead to tractable phenomenological

models. Indeed, in the limit of an infinitely fine-grained

discretization this model leads to a Fick's law of informa-

Ferromagnetic example
In figure 5 we show the evolution of the geometric quantum state for a qubit in a ferromagnetic Ising environment. We do not show the short-time transient, as it is qualitatively similar to the antiferromagnetic case, still exhibiting the tri-furcation dynamical pattern. Rather, we focus on two aspects of this non-equilibrium evolution, which were absent from the antiferromagnetic example: sustained fluctuations. We have highlighted them with the black arrow superimposed to the top left plot, and are more evident if one can watch the evolution on the video, which can be found here. At its core, this is an emergent phenomenon in which the probability mass, instead of diffusing across the whole state space as in the antiferromagnetic example, appears to be rotating around a point loosely localized as Zcenter  (p = 0.1,  = ). As a result of this, over time the distribution µik(t)

Time-average of the coarse-grained geometric quantum state, µik(t), which conveys the information about how much information about the system is contained in a small cell Cik of state space. In the case of a ferromagnetic Ising environment the non-equilibrium behavior of the quantum system maintains forces the information to be localized in a certain region of the state space, loosely localized around Zcenter = (p = 0.1,  = ). Here this is shown by plotting the time-average of µik(t), after the first 100 time-steps, to avoid including transient behavior. A localized distribution is evident.

previous section help us understand how this occur. In-

deed, by plotting the coarse-grained flux of information

Jik(t) = Cik Jt(Z)dVF S and the coarse-grained information production term, in Figure 6 we see that the localiza-

tion of the information around Zcenter, and its stability

over time, arises from a tension between a sink term,

drawing up information and delocalizing it across the

state space, and a rotating vector field Jik(t), moving the

points away from the sink but maintaining them close to

Zcenter with an overall rotation effect. Over time, these

two effects balance each other out maintaining a the in-

formation localized around Zcenter, as it can be seen from

the instantaneous distribution µik(t), plotted in the top

row of Figure 6.

While a fully analytical description of this phenomenon requires an in-depth investigation of the microscopic details, the analysis given in term of information flux and information sink and source term provides a clear connection between the microscopic, kinetic, evolution and the macroscopic behavior provided by expectation values of observables like z .

VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this work we have developed a consistent framework to study how quantum systems move information around their state space. Our main results are the continuity equation (Eq.16) and the underlying kinetic equation (Eq.28). Together, they regulate how information is can be transported around the quantum state space as a result of the interactions between the system and its environment. The kinetic equation represents the microscopic, detailed, model while the continuity equation is more adapt to extract phenomenological descriptions. As an example of this logic, in Section IV and V we have looked at the transport of information in the state space of a qubit. In both cases we have seen the emergence of well-defined average behavior that can, in principle, be described with sufficiently simple information fluxes. In the case of an isolated qubit we were able to analytically extract the information flux and for the case of an antiferromagnetic Ising environment with both longitudinal and transverse field, we have seen how a simple diffusion model can reproduce the macroscopic feature of the kinetic evolution.
While here we focused only on the theoretical framework, we believe we have shown that the detailed study of concrete kinetic models of information transport is phenomenologically richer than expected. Future work in

this direction will be focused on extracting more general, approximated, analytical models and developing more powerful numerical techniques, to investigate the behavior of quantum systems with larger environments. In this sense, an interesting concrete issue is to understand how quantum information moves around the quantum state space when our system is part of a quantum computer performing quantum computation. Indeed, we believe this framework can help better understand how to improve and optimize quantum information processing for future quantum technologies. Moreover, the analyses outlined in Section IV and V have exhibited certain features of interest, which deserve further investigation. For example, the emergence of the fractal pattern in the transient behavior and the more general question of describing stationary states with non-trivial non-equilibrium behavior.
