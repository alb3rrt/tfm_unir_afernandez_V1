Density-functional theory within a Berry-phase formulation of the dynamical polarization is used to determine the second-order susceptibility (2) of lithium niobate (LiNbO3). Defect trapped polarons and bipolarons are found to strongly enhance the nonlinear susceptibility of the material, in particular if localized at NbV­VLi defect pairs. This is essentially a consequence of the polaronic excitation resulting in relaxation-induced gap states. The occupation of these levels leads to strongly enhanced (2) coefficients and allows for the spatial and transient modification of the second-harmonic generation of macroscopic samples.

The arbitrary control of electromagnetic waves is a key aim of photonic research. This requires the engineering of optical coefficients, e.g., by doping, strain, or electric fields [1­4]. Photorefractive materials like lithium niobate (LiNbO3, LN) that respond to light by altering their refractive index are of particular interest in this context [5, 6]. Lithium niobate is used, e.g., for optical waveguides, optical modulators, photonic integrated circuits and nonvolatile holographic storage [7, 8].

FIG. 1. (Color online) Schematic illustration of electron polaron states in lithium niobate. Band-to-band excitation and subsequent carrier localization result in the formation of free (F) and bound (P) polarons, which combine to bipolarons (B). Bipolarons may transform structurally or dissociate into single electron polarons. Charge densities of the polaron orbitals are shown on the sides: free polaron (left) and bound polaron (right), both in tilted ground state configuration.. See Fig. 2 for complete structures and the notation of atoms.
The LN optical properties are profoundly affected by polarons, i.e., electrons excited to a state close to the edge of the conduction band that get dressed with a cloud of virtual polar phonons [9­13]. Free small polarons (F) are the simplest polaron species in LN, see Fig. 1. They are formed by extra electrons stabilized at regular NbNb ions of the LN lattice. Bound polarons (P) and bound bipolarons (B) are formed by single electrons and pairs of electrons, respectively, localized at point defects. These defects are related to excess Nb compensating the lithium

deficit observed in the congruently melting composition of lithium niobate. Single polarons (F and P) are usually found as metastable states upon optical excitation and may combine to bipolarons. The latter also result from thermal or electrochemical reduction and can be thermally or optically split into single electron polarons [9, 11, 14]. Optical absorption peaks at about 0.9 eV, 1.6 eV, and 2.5 eV are assigned to F [15], P [16], and B polarons[17], respectively.
Controlling second-harmonic generation (SHG) in lithium niobate, i.e., the generation of new photons with twice the energy of the initial photons, requires engineering the second-order susceptibility (2) [18­20]. Although polarons have been known for a long time to cause various optical nonlinearities, such as green-induced infrared absorption [21], their influence on (2) is essentially unknown. In this Letter, we show by means of first-princples calculations that electron polarons cause a strong enhancement of the (2) susceptibility for photon energies in the lower half of the LN band gap and thus provide a means to control SHG in space and time.
In detail, we perform density-functional theory (DFT) electronic-structure calculations based on the Quantum Espresso [22, 23] implementation. The generalized gradient approximation is employed using the PBEsol functional. The nonlinear susceptibilities are obtained from the real-time evolution of the Bloch electrons in a uniform time-dependent electric field following the Berry-phase approach proposed by Attaccalite and Gru¨ning [24].
Stoichiometric LN crystallizes in a rhombohedral unit cell. Oxygen atoms form octahedra that are alternatingly occupied by Li, Nb, or are empty, see Fig. 2(a). The present polaron calculations are based on previously established models [25], which account for both the measured optical absorption peaks and the electron paramagnetic resonance data. As shown in Fig. 2, we consider (a) free polarons, where the excess electron is bound to a regular NbNb ion, (b) bound polarons with the excess electron at the NbLi antisite defect, (c) bound polarons with the excess electron at the Nb interstitial of the NbV­ VLi defect pair and bipolarons, where one of the excess electrons is at the defect niobium atom of (d) the NbLi

antisite defect or (e) the NbV­VLi defect pair, and the second one is at the neighboring Nb atom. The structures shown in (a), (b), and (c) are studied in both the axially symmetric and quasi-Jahn-Teller distorted (tilted) configurations [25]. The structures (d) and (e) have axial symmetry. In this case, the niobium atoms carrying the excess electrons shift along the crystal z axis preserving the threefold rotational symmetry. In the tilted configurations, the polaron-carrying atoms are shifted in the xy plane, which results in clover-leave like orbitals for the excess electrons [25]. The defect structures are modeled with 80-atom supercells, as described in Ref. [26]. Here, a 3×3×3 -centred k-point sampling is used for the (2) calculations. The bulk LN calculations are performed using the 10-atom unit cell and a 6×6×6 -centred k-point grid to determine (2).

Fig. 3 shows the modulus of calculated second-order susceptibility tensor elements in dependence on the incident photon energy. Unless stated otherwise, we plot the most frequently measured value |(z2z)z()|. The calculations for the stoichiometric bulk material agree well with previous calculations [27] and reproduce the order of magnitude of the measured data [28]. The low |(z2z)z()| values for energies in the lower half of the LN band gap are strongly enhanced upon bipolaron formation and for P(NbV­VLi) with the axial symmetry. In the case of B(NbV­VLi), where the enhancement is most pronounced, we also show the other second-order susceptibility tensor elements that are nonzero in trigonal symmetry [29], as e.g. present for stoichiometric LN as well as for the polaron states with axial symmetry: |(y2x)x()|, |(y2y)z()|, and |(z2x)x()| in Fig. 3. The latter are far

smaller than |(z2z)z()| in the low-energy region. A common feature of all the systems with strongly en-
hanced |(z2z)z()| is a pronounced hybridization of the polaron orbital at the defect niobium atom with the neighbouring atom along the z direction (see insets in Fig. 3). This hybridization shifts the center of the polaronic charge away from its position in ideal stochiometric LN.

in many cases to relate linear and nonlinear susceptibilities of noncentrosymmetric crystals. As can be seen in Fig. 4, Miller's rule holds indeed for stoichiometric LN but is clearly violated for bipolarons and NbV­VLi localized bound polarons. Obviously, these systems are characterized by a strong bond charge acentricity and are not well described within the classical anharmonic oscillator model [18, 31]. In fact, the (2) values calculated here for the polaron or bipolaron containing supercells, i.e., |(z2z)z|  200 pmV-1 within the region of the LN band gap, are comparable to the value of GaAs in the energy region above the band gap, which is known as one of the largest (2) values reported for solid state systems [18].
What is the microscopic origin of the large optical nonlinearities associated with some polaron species? In order to answer this question we separate the influence of the defect formation and of the polaronic excitation, i.e., the trapping of additional electrons and of the associated lattice relaxation for the cases of the bipolarons as well as P(NbV­VLi). In Fig. 5 it can be seen that the point defects themselves only slightly modify the |(z2z)z| bulk values, at least for low photon energies. However, upon polaronic excitation the low-energy susceptibility is much enhanced, in analogy to the polaron-related additional absorption peaks in the linear optical response [15­17]. This enhancement can either be due to electronic transitions related to the polaron states, or it may be caused by the lattice relaxation accompanying the polaron formation. To discriminate between these two possibilities we perform calculations for supercells that model the (bi)polaron geometries, but do not contain the corresponding electrons. The corresponding spectra are plotted with dashed lines in Fig. 5. It can be seen that in the case of bipolarons both electronic occupation and lattice relaxation contribute to the (2) enhancement, while the electronic effects are dominant for bound polarons. For

B(NbV­VLi) the SHG enhancement is not restricted to the spectral region around 1 eV, but extends to energies up to 2 eV, where an additonal second peak can be identified. This peak is related to transitions into empty Nb 4d states close the conduction-band edge and be already identified in the B(NbV­VLi) linear optical response [26]. Indeed, it well predicted already from Miller's rule applied to (1) calculated for B(NbV­VLi). This is shown by the black dashed line in Fig. 5.
How important will the polaronic SHG enhancement effect be for real samples? Merschjann and coworkers [32] determined polaron densities in congruently melting LiNbO3 by time-resolved pump­multiprobe spectroscopy. They obtained a steady-state number density of bipolarons of 6.7×1023 m-3 at room temperature without illumination. The polaron density can be drastically enhanced by optical excitation. Electron polarons in lithium niobate are generated optically within a few hundred femtoseconds [33, 34]. Thereby concentrations far higher than in the steady state can be achieved. Buse

independent-particle approximation (DFT) also an estimate
for the influence of self-energy corrections (Scissors Operator)
is shown, see text.

A word of caution is in order considering the present DFT calculation. Optical excitations are known to be influenced by electronic many-body effects beyond DFT [35­41]. In order to probe their influence, a scissors operator correction is added to the effective Hamiltonian for the Bloch electrons. Its size has been determined by GW calculations [25] that predict a blueshift of 0.6 eV for transitions from the B(NbV­VLi) polaron state to the LN conduction band minimum compared to the DFT calculations. As expected, the self-energy effects lead to a blueshift and weakening of the SHG signal. As excitonic effects are expected to redshift and increase the SHG spectral features [35­38], the dashed line in Fig. 6 represents an upper limit for the excitation energies and a lower limit for the SHG enhancement that can be expected to result from the bipolaron formation. Obviously, the polaronic effect on (2) predicted here from DFT is robust with respect to many-body effects.
In summary, the present density-functional calculations predict a strong (2) enhancement in lithium niobate upon formation of bound (bi)polarons. It is caused primarily by the occupation of the relaxationinduced polaronic defect levels in the gap. Further details of the SHG enhancement depend sensitively on the relative position of the polaronic charge density with respect to the neighboring cations of the ferroelectric host material. The polaron density in real samples de-

pends (i) on the availability of possible lattice trapping sites ­ that may be locally modified by doping [9] ­ and (ii) can be strongly increased by optical excitation of the sample. The polaronic enhancement of the nonlinear optical coefficients predicted here thus suggests a novel way to control second-harmonic generation in space and time beyond strain or external electric field induced effects.
