Global solvability and convergence to stationary solutions in singular quasilinear stochastic PDEs
Tadahisa Funaki and Bin Xie
Abstract
We consider singular quasilinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) studied in [7], which are defined in paracontrolled sense. The main aim of the present article is to establish the global-in-time solvability for a particular class of SPDEs with origin in particle systems and, under a certain additional condition on the noise, prove the convergence of the solutions to stationary solutions as t  . We apply the method of energy inequality and Poincar´e inequality. It is essential that the Poincar´e constant can be taken uniformly in an approximating sequence of the noise. We also use the continuity of the solutions in the enhanced noise, initial values and coefficients of the equation, which we prove in this article for general SPDEs discussed in [7] except that in the enhanced noise. Moreover, we apply the initial layer property of improving regularity of the solutions in a short time.

assumption: a, g  C3(R) satisfying (1.2), see Lemma 1.4 below.

1.1 The aim of the article

The present article is a continuation of [7]. Assuming that two coefficients a and g satisfy the relation a = g, we establish the global-in-time solvability and convergence of the solution to a stationary solution as t  , see Theorems 1.1 and 1.2. For the convergence to the stationary solution, we assume |µ| is small enough for the noise , where µ is the constant defined from  by (1.7) below. A typical example of the noise  is the derivative of a periodic Brownian motion w = w(x), x  T:  = w and, for this , µ = 0 holds. Then, in general without assuming such conditions for the coefficients a, g and noise , we show the continuity of the local-in-time solution in initial values, see Theorem 1.3. This is used for the proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2.
Let   C4(R) satisfying

(1.3)

c-  (v)  c+

for some c-, c+ > 0 and   C3(R) be given, and consider the SPDE

(1.4)

tv = {(v)} + {(v)}, x  T.

Note that the linear case (v) = (v) = v is included. Then, for every m  R, if u  um is a solution of (1.1) with a(v) = (v + m), g(v) = (v + m), v := um + m solves the equation (1.4) under the assumption a, g  Cb3(R), see Section 1.2 of [7] and an indirect Definition 1.1 of the solution of (1.4) below. Note that, if  is smooth, this is true in classical sense. In particular, (1.4) has a local-in-time solution v in LT-1. See Subsection 1.4 for more explanation on the relation between u and v under the weak assumption
a, g  C3(R). We note that the equation (1.4) has a mass conservation law:

(1.5)

v(t, x)dx = m
T

for all t  0 with a constant m  R, which is determined from its initial value v0.
As we mentioned above, the main aim of the present article is to show the global-intime solvability and establish the convergence of the solution to the stationary solution as t   for the SPDE (1.1) when the coefficients satisfy a = g. For this purpose, it turns out to be more convenient to study the SPDE in the form of (1.4). Due to the discussions in Subsection 1.4, especially by Definition 1.1, the result for (1.4) implies that for u for the solution u of (1.1). Our assumption a = g for (1.1) corresponds to  =  for (1.4) so that we consider the equation of the special form

(1.6)

tv = {(v)} + {(v)},

on T. The equation (1.6) has a physical meaning in the sense that it can be derived from a microscopic particle system in random environment, see [14].

2

Our another aim is to establish the continuity of the solution of (1.1) in initial values in general without assuming a = g. We use such property in the study of the SPDE (1.6),
but we show it for the general case. The solution determines a continuous flow on the state space C  {} with a death point  added to cover the explosion of the solutions, see
Remark 2.4 in Subsection 2.2. The equation (1.1) can be considered as if a deterministic
PDE once  is fixed, so that it is different from the SPDEs driven by the space-time white
noise, but the continuity in initial value u0 in our case corresponds to the strong Feller property for such SPDEs, cf. [11].

1.2 Global solution in time and convergence to stationary solutions

We consider the SPDE tions, for a given , we

Note

that

   := (T) = , 1 = (1)  R.

It is known that   C-1(R) and especially   C([0, 1]), see Lemma A.10 of [9]. Typically, we can take  = w (x) +  with a periodic Brownian motion w(x), x  T and   R. The most interesting noise is  = w and, in this case,  = 0 holds.
Then, from  or equivalently from , we define a function (x) = (x) on T and a constant µ = µ  R, respectively, by

Note that (x) > 0 so it is uniformly positive by its continuity. Indeed, this is obvious

Moreover,

 is periodic: (0) = (1) = 1. In case  = 0, we have µ = 0 (and vice versa) and

(x) = e-(x). Note that  = (x) satisfies

(1.8)

 +  = µ

at least if   C(T), that is,   C1([0, 1]), and therefore (z) + (z · ) = 0 holds for every z  R. In particular, v = -1(z) are stationary solutions of (1.6), where -1 is the inverse function of .
For each conserved mass m  R given as in (1.5), determine z = zm  R uniquely by the relation

(1.9)

m = -1(z(x))dx.
T

Note that, since  satisfies (1.3) and in particular, it is strictly increasing, this determines a one to one relation between z and m. Then,

(1.10)

v¯(x)  v¯m(x) := -1(zm(x))

3

is a stationary solution of (1.6) satisfying T vdx = m in distributional sense, or at least if   C(T). Indeed, the mass conservation law is clear and, as we noted above,

{(v¯m)} + {(v¯m)} = zm{ + } = zmµ = 0,

so that the right hand side of (1.6) vanishes for v = v¯m.

As we will see, at least if |µ| is small enough, v¯m is the unique stationary solution of the SPDE (1.6) for each fixed m, where µ is the constant determined in (1.7) from the noise . In fact, we will show in Section 2 that, for initial value v0(x) satisfying (1.5) (with v(t) replaced by v0), the solution v(t, x) of the SPDE (1.6) converges to the stationary solution v¯m as t   at least if |µ| is small. Moreover, without assuming the smallness of |µ|, the SPDE (1.6) has a global solution in time.

Theorem

1.1.

Let





C 4 (R)

satisfy

(1.3)

and





(

).

Then, for every initial

value v0  C-1, the SPDE (1.6) has a global-in-time solution v(t)  C-1 for all t  0.

Moreover, if |µ| is sufficiently small, v(t) converges exponentially fast to v¯m in C-1 as

t  :

(1.11)

v(t) - v¯m C-1  Ce-ct,

for some c, C > 0, where m is determined from v0 as m = T v0(x)dx.

We apply the energy inequality, Poincar´e inequality, the continuity of the solutions in enhanced noise and initial values, and also the initial layer property to show Theorem 1.1. See Remark 2.2 below for the SPDE (1.4) with general  instead of (1.6).

This theorem for the slope v(t) = u(t) of u(t) implies the following result for u(t) itself.

Theorem 1.2. Assume a = g  C3(R) (so that g  C4(R)), the condition (1.2) and

Then,

Moreover, if |µ| is sufficiently small as in Theorem 1.1, u(t) has the following uniform

bound in t:

(1.12)

sup u(t) - z0µt C < ,
t0

where z0 is defined by (1.9) with m = 0. In particular, we have

(ii) For the space-time white noise case as in [8], the average (i.e. integral on T) of u(t)

behaves as a Brownian motion and it never converges as t  . But, in our case, noise

is only spatially dependent and the situation is different. Removing the constant drift, u(t)

stays bounded in t.

We remark that the existence of global solutions of singular semilinear SPDEs are
known, for example, for the following models. The linear equation (1.1) with a = 1, g = v on Rd (i.e., the equation (1.6) with (v) = v) is studied in [4] and respectively, the
generalized parabolic Anderson model (PAM) (i.e., the equation (1.6) with (v) = v
and without ) in [9] (Remark 5.4) and [2] by different approaches. For the nonlinear case, the dynamic 43-model on T3 is studied in [16] by establishing a priori estimate, and the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation on T3 in [12]. The global existence for multi-
component coupled Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation is shown in [6] under the trilinear
condition by studying its stationary measure. In addition, there are few works on the
exponential decay in time of the solutions of singular semilinear SPDEs. For instance, [17] showed the exponential decay for the dynamic P ()2-model on T2 to its unique invariant measure with respect to the total variation norm as t  , and recently [10] showed the exponential L2-ergodicity of conservative stochastic Burgers equation on T based on
the approach of the martingale problem. Among these, to the best of our knowledge, our
result is the first one in quasilinear case.

1.3 Continuity of the local solution in initial values and parameter m

Let u(t, ^, u0), t  T denote the local-in-time paracontrolled solution of (1.1) for each fixed enhanced noise ^ := (, (X, )) and initial value u0. In [7], it is shown that the paracontrolled solution u(t, ^, u0) is continuous in the enhanced noise ^ for each fixed initial value u0, see Theorem 3.1-(ii) of [7]. In Section 3, we show the joint continuity of u(t, ^, u0) in (^, u0) without the restriction a = g. More precisely, the main result of Section 3 is the next theorem.

Theorem

1.3.

Let





(

13 9

,

)

and

u(t, ^, u0)



C

be

the

unique

local

paracontrolled

solu-

tion of (1.1) with initial value u0  C at least up to time T = T ( u0 C , ^ C-2×C2-2 ).

Then, u(t, ^, u0) is continuous in (t, ^, u0) in the region {(t, ^, u0)  [0, ) × (C-2 ×

C2-3) × C ; t  T }. In particular, for each 0 < t  T , the solution u(t) of (1.1) is

continuous in its initial values.

This theorem can be easily proved by Theorem 3.1 in Section 3, see also Remark 3.2. Furthermore, the continuity in m of the solution u = u(t, m, ^, u0) of (1.1) with the coefficients a and g replaced by a(· + m) and g(· + m), respectively, can be shown by a straightforward extension of our estimates, see Remark 3.3.
Remark 1.2. (i) For the special case a = g, we have that u(t, ^, u0) of (1.1) is continuous in (t, ^, u0) in the region {(t, ^, u0)  [0, ) × (C-2 × C2-3) × C} by Theorems 1.2 and 1.3. (ii) From the explanation in Subsection 1.4, we see that Theorem 1.3 implies that the solution v(t, ^, v0) of (1.4) is continuous in the region {(t, ^, v0)  [0, )×(C-2×C2-3)× C-1; t  T } and in particular, v(t, ^, v0) is continuous in its initial values v0 up to time T . Moreover, by Theorem 1.1, for the special type of SPDE (1.6), we know that its solution v(t, v0) is continuous in (t, v0) in the region {(t, v0)  [0, ) × C-1}.
Remark 1.3. Hairer and Mattingly [11] discussed as follows: Let U be the state space of solutions of certain SPDE and U¯ := U  {} by adding the death point  to cover

5

blow-up of solutions. They consider the solution of SPDE as a random dynamical system s,t : U¯ × M  U¯ , where M denotes the space of admissible models for a given regularity structure. In our case, we may fix the noise (or more precisely, the enhanced noise), and consider the solution of SPDE as a deterministic dynamical system (t : U¯  U¯ would be enough). Their Assumption 1 is for the continuity of the map s,t. They first prove the strong Feller property under general setting, and then show the assumptions formulated in
general setting for several singular SPDEs. In our case, once the noise is fixed, the solution
is deterministic so that what we need is the continuity of the solution in the initial value.

1.4 Definition of the solution of (1.4) and relation to (1.1)

Recall that the solution u(t) of (1.1) was defined in paracontrolled sense by solving the fixed point problem for the map  defined by (2.16) in the class BT (), see [7].
Let us first remark the following lemma which generalizes Theorem 1.1 of [7] and is shown by the cut-off argument.

Lemma

1.4.

Let





(

C 3 (R)

and

the

condition

(1.2)

be

satisfied.

Then,

the

SPDE (1.1) has a unique local-in-time solution u(t) defined in paracontrolled sense.

Proof. For a given a  C3(R), we can take a sequence of functions an  Cb3(R) such that 0 < c-  an  c+, an(v) = a(v), |v| n and an converges uniformly to a on each compact set. Similarly, for a given g  C3(R), let us take a sequence of functions gn  C03(R) such that gn(v) = g(v), |v| n and gn converges uniformly to g on each compact set. Let us consider the equation

(1.13)

tun = an(un)un + gn(un) · 

starting from u0  C. Then, the assumptions of Theorem 1.1 of [7] are satisfied and we know that (1.13) has a unique paracontrolled solution un = un(t) up to a time Tn > 0 a.s., which is similarly defined by (2.23). Without loss of generality, we may assume Tn <  a.s. Let us now define  n by  n = inf{t > 0 : un(t) C  n}. Then, it is clear that  n > 0 a.s., whenever u0 C < n and Lemma 2.5 below gives that  n  Tn. Moreover, we have um(t) = un(t), t   m   n. Therefore, one knows that (1.1) has a unique solution u(t) in the paracontrolled sense at least up to the time limn  n > 0 a.s.

As we mentioned, (1.4) is obtained at least for a smooth noise from (1.1) with proper

modification in m by differentiation. Motivated by this, we give the meaning to the

equation (1.4) indirectly of (1.4) be given. Then,

via set

the equation (1.1). Let an m := T v0(x)dx and define

initial value u0  C by

v0  C-1, integrating

)

as

(1.14)

x
u0(x) = (v0(y) - m)dy + C, x  R,
0

for any constant C  R. We solve (1.1) with a(v) = (v + m), g(v) = (v + m) and this initial value u0 in paracontrolled sense. The solution is denoted by u(t) = u(t; v0, C). Recall u(t)  LT for some T > 0.

Definition 1.1. We call v(t) := u(t; v0, C) + m  LT-1 the solution of the SPDE (1.4) with initial value v0.

6

Note that, if the noise  (and v0) is smooth, v(t) is a smooth classical solution of (1.4). Indeed, in such case, u(t) is a smooth solution of (1.1) so that this follows by

differentiation. Note also that v(t; v0, C) does not depend on the choice of C. Indeed, again for smooth smeared noise , we easily see u(t; v0, C) = u(t; v0, 0) + C for the corresponding solutions u of (1.1). Thus, by applying Theorem 1.1 of [7] and taking the

limit   0, we see that u(t; v0, C) = u(t; v0, 0) + C holds for general noise . This implies u(t; v0, C) = u(t; v0, 0). In particular, v(t) is well-defined.

Conversely, u(t) can be recovered from v(t) = u(t) (with m = 0) as follows. Assume

(In the right hand side, especially in the first and third terms, we regard T = [0, 1).) Then, one can show that u(t) solves the equation (1.1) with a = , g = , see Lemma 2.10 below. At least if  is smooth, the equivalence between (1.1) and (1.4) is established.
Moreover, concerning the renormalizations, the equation (1.1) in integrated form does not require them, since the resonant term (X, ) involves the derivative of X as we discussed in [7] (though (1.1) is an analog of KPZ equation). In particular, the equation (1.4) in differentiated form does not require them too.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 is for the proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2. We first formulate the energy estimate for (1.6) driven by a smooth noise in Subsection 2.1, see Proposition 2.2. Then, the proof of Theorem 1.1 is given in Subsection 2.2. We note the continuity of the solution in the enhanced noise ^, the initial values and the parameter m in the coefficients. We derive Poincar´e inequality and show that the Poincar´e constant can be taken uniformly in the approximating sequence of the noise. We also rely on the initial layer type property of the solution of the SPDE (1.6), that is, the regularity of the solution is improved in an arbitrary short time. Subsection 2.3 is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.2 based on the relation between (1.1) and (1.4). In Section 3, we show Theorem 1.3 by establishing Theorem 3.1.

2 Global solvability and convergence to stationary solution

We show the global solvability of (1.6) based on the energy inequality and Poincar´e in-

equality. This gives the exponentially fast convergence in C-1 of the solution v(t) to the

stationary one, first for the initial value v(0)  D, at least if |µ| is sufficiently small. Here D is the class of all functions v  C-1 satisfying (v)-1  H1, where H1 = H1(T) is the

Sobolev space on T. Then, this result will be extended to general initial values v(0)  C-1

by the initial equivalent to

layer type property of the solution.

2.1 Method of energy inequality

In this subsection, we assume   C(T) (or at least   C2(T)) and consider a differentiable solution v(t, x) of (1.6). More precisely, if   C2(T), the equation (1.4) is a classical
PDE of divergence form:

(2.1)

tv = {a1(v, v)} - a2(x, v, v), x  T,

or, we can further rewrite it as

(2.2)

tv = a3(v)v - A(x, v, v), x  T,

where a1(v, p) = (v)p, a2(x, v, p) = -((x)(v) + (x)(v)p), a3(v) = (v) and A(x, v, p) = -(v)p2 + a2(x, v, p). Note that (2.1) and (2.2) are written in the forms of (6.1) and (6.4) in [13] (p.449, p.450), respectively. We actually consider (1.6) so that  = . Recall that   C4(R) satisfies (1.3) and this, in particular, implies the lin-
ear growth property of : |(v)| C(|v|+1). Thus, we see that the conditions a)­d) of
Theorem 6.1 ([13], p.452), especially,

pa1(v, p) (= (v))  0, A(x, v, 0)v  -b1v2 - b2, 0 < c-  pa1(v, p)  c+, (|a1|+|va1|)(1 + |p|) + |a2| CM (p2 + 1)

hold for x  T, |v| M, p  R. Indeed, the second bound follows from

|A(x, v, 0)v|= |a2(x, v, 0)v|= |(x)| |(v)v| C2(v2 + 1).

Note that M > 0 given in (6.8) of [13] can be taken in our situation by applying the maximum principle, see Remark 2.1-(i) below. The condition   C2(T) is required for
the condition c). The condition d) is shown by the boundedness of va1, pa2, va2 for |v| M and |p| M1 for each M, M1 > 0. Therefore, by Theorem 6.1 of [13], (1.4) has a unique global-in-time classical solution v(t, x) ( H1+/2,2+([0, T ] × T)) if   C2(T) and the initial value v(0)  C2+(T) for some   (0, 1). Furthermore, noting that
|a1(v, p)|+|va1(v, p)| CM |p|, |v| M, p  R, by Theorem 6.4 ([13], p.460), the existence of global-in-time classical solution is known if   C2(T) and v(0)  C(T),   (0, 1). Note that, from examples in p.99 of [1] or p.62 -L. 8 of [9], we know that C = H (H¨older space used in [13]) for all   R+ \ N. One can easily check that the classical solution of
(1.4) is a solution in paracontrolled sense. This shows that the life time of the solution v(t)  C-1 of (1.6) equals to infinity, i.e.,

T  T(^, v(0)) := sup{t  0; solution of (1.6) with initial value v(0) exists} = ,

if   C2(T) and v(0)  C-1,  > 1. We expect that T is lower semicontinuous in ^ as in [6], but this combined with T =  for   C2(T) does not imply the same for general   C-2.
As we mentioned, in this subsection, we assume   C(T) and v(t, x) is a smooth global-in-time solution of (1.6), i.e., v  C1,2((0, )× T) C([0, )× T). We define f (t, x)
as

(2.3)

f (t, x)

:=

(v(t, x)) (x)

,

8

where  = (x) is defined in (1.7). Note that f (t, x) is periodic in x  T. Then, we have
(v) = (f ) = f ·  + f  = f ·  + f (- + µ) = f ·  + µf - (v).

Therefore, the equation (1.6) can be rewritten as

Let L2 := L2(T, dx) and H1 := H1(T, dx) be the spaces equipped with the norms f L2 := ( T f 2dx)1/2 and f H1 := ( T{f 2 + (f )2}dx)1/2, respectively. We define the functional (f )  (f ) of f  H1 as

Lemma 2.1. The functional  is Fr´echet differentiable in H1 and its Fr´echet derivative D(f )  (H1) is given by

(2.5)

D(f )()  (H1) D(f ),  H1 =

f  dx,

for   H1. If f  C2(T), this is further rewritten as

D(x, f )(x) dx,

(2.6)

D(x, f ) = --1(f ),

Proof. Take   H1 and define D(f )() as (2.5). Then,

(f + ) - (f ) - D(f )() = () = o(  H1 ) as  H1  0. This shows the Fr´echet differentiability of  and the formula (2.5). The formula (2.6) for D(x, f ) is shown by a simple integration by parts:

f  dx = - -1(f ) dx.

Noting v = -1(f ) from (2.3) and using (2.6), (2.4) is rewritten as

which is sometimes called Onsager equation at least when µ = 0, see [15], p.193. See also Remark 2.1 below for this equation.

Proposition 2.2. Assume   C(T) and v(t, x) is a smooth global-in-time solution of (1.6). Then, for f (t) defined by (2.3), if f (0)  H1, we have the bound

where we have used Schwarz's inequality twice. This shows the conclusion.

Remark 2.1. (i) The equation (2.8) is rewritten as

(2.16)

tf = K(x, f )-1(f ) + µK(x, f )-1f.

As we saw above, under the assumption   C(T), f exists globally in time and (2.16)

can be considered as a linear PDE for f regarding the coefficient K(x, f ) is given. Then,

since the right hand side of (2.16) has no zeroth-order term in f , it satisfies the maximum

principle and we have

min f (0, x)  f (t, x)  max f (0, x),

xT

xT

see, for example, [5] p.368. Based on this observation and taking the limit in , one can cover the case   C(T) and show the global-in-time solvability of (1.6). This provides another proof of the first part of Theorem 1.1, though the present article relies on the

method of energy inequality.

(ii) (Linear case) When (v) = v, we have G(x, f ) = K(x, f ) = 1. In addition, if µ = 0, or equivalently, if  = 0 holds, (2.8) defines a simple gradient flow:

(2.17)

tf = -D(x, f ),

and

this

implies

t(f ) = -

D(·, f )

2 L2

.

Remark 2.2. For the SPDE (1.4) with general  and smooth , the stationary solution is a periodic solution v = v(x) of the ordinary differential equation

{(v)} + {(v)} = 0.

As before, setting  = (v), this equation is rewritten as

(2.18)

 + () = µ,

where () := (-1()) and µ is any constant. If µ = 0, the equation (2.18) is of separable type and solved as

() 

 0

d ()

=

-(x)

+

C,

x  T.

For simplicity, if  > 0, then  is increasing and (2.18) is solved as

C (x) = -1(-(x) + C).

12

For C to be periodic,  should satisfy (0) = (1), that is,  = 0. In other words, the condition µ = 0 implies  = 0. On the other hand, the constant C = Cm is determined from the conservation law (1.5).
Once stationary solutions are found, to link them to the SPDE (1.4), we need to find a proper transformation like (2.3) from v to f , which extracts the factor z, that is C in the present setting for general , and also a proper functional (f ) of f . However, this looks nontrivial.
Note that, in case  = , () = , () = log|| and C (x) = ±e-(x)+C = ze-(x), assuming µ = 0.

start

with

u(t), i.e., the unique local-in-time paracontrolled solution of (1.1) with the initial value

u0  C.

Let us recall Theorem 3.1 (i) in [7]. In that theorem, it is declared that the map 

defined by (2.16) in [7] (or see (3.1) below, which is defined in a little different setting

from the original one) is contractive from BT () (a variant of (3.4) below) into itself for some large enough  and small enough T > 0. But, the explicit choices of  and T were

not given. To show Lemma 2.5 below, let us explicitly choose  and T . They can be

constructed easily by the estimates (3.48) and (3.50) obtained in the proof of Theorem 3.1

(i) in [7]. In fact, by these estimates, we know that there exists a large enough constant M > 0 such that for all u := (u, u)  BT (),

where M is same as in (2.19). Then, Theorem 3.1 (i) of [7] can be restated as follows.
Theorem 2.4 (Theorem 3.1 (i) of [7]). Let  and T be defined by (2.21) and (2.22), respectively. Then, for any u0  C (or equivalently u0  C and u0  C),  is contractive from BT () into itself. In particular,  has a unique fixed point on [0, T ], which is the unique solution of the system (2.17) and (2.18) in [7] and it solves the SPDE (1.1) on [0, T ] in the paracontrolled sense.

Remark 2.3. From Theorem 2.4, we see that the time T chosen as in (2.22) depends
continuously on the norm u0 C(or equivalently on u0 C and u0 C ), which is vital for the proof of the next Lemma 2.5.

Let us define the explosion time T by (2.23) T  T(^, u0) := sup{t  0 ; solution u(t)  C of (1.1) starting from u0 exists}.

We know that T > 0. Furthermore, we have the following result.

Lemma 2.5. If T < , we have

lim u(t) C = .
tT

Proof. By the definition of T, the solution exists and satisfies u(·)  C([0, T), C). If the conclusion does not hold, one can find M > 0 and a sequence tn  T such that u(tn) C  M . However, by Theorem 2.4 and Remark 2.3, there exists  = M > 0, which is uniform in n, such that one can solve (1.1) starting from u(tn) on the time interval [tn, tn + ]. Since tn  T, this shows that one can solve (1.1) beyond T and contradicts the definition of T.
Remark 2.4. In particular, let C  {} be the one point compactification of C and define u(t) :=  for t  T. Then, u(t) is defined for all t  0 and u(·)  C([0, ), C  {}) by Lemma 2.5. Denoting u(t) with initial value u0  C  {} by u(t, u0), it has the flow property: u(t, u(s, u0)) = u(t + s, u0) for all t, s  0.

We extend the result of Proposition 2.2 to general noise   C-2, D is the class of all functions v  C-1 satisfying (v)-1  H1.





(

Recall

Proposition 2.6. Assume that the initial value of the SPDE (1.6) satisfies v(0)  D. Then, the solution v(t) exists globally in time for all t  0 and f (t) defined from v(t) by (2.3) satisfies

(2.24)

(f (t))  eCt(f (0)),

for some C  R. In particular, if |µ| is small enough, one can take C < 0.

14

Proof. First assume that   C(T) and let f (t, x) be as in (2.3) and Proposition 2.2

defined from v(t, x) := u(t, x) + m, where m = T v(0, x)dx and u(t, x) is a (classical)

global-in-time solution of (1.1) with initial value u0 defined by (1.14), a = (· + m) and

g = (· + m). Then, we have the estimate (2.9) for (f (t)), if f (0)  H1.

Now,

let





C-2, 



(

be

given

and

take

a

sequence

of

n



C (T)

such

that ^n = (n, (Xn, n)) converges to ^ = (, (X, )) in C-2 × C2-3 as n  ,

see Lemma 5.2 in [7] for details. Let vn(0) := -1(f (0)n), mn = T vn(0, x)dx, an =

(· + mn) and gn = (· + mn), where n = n is defined as in (1.7) from the integral n

of n. Note that vn(0) is chosen in such a way that fn(0)(:= (vn(0))/n) = f (0) holds

foe every n.

We consider the SPDE (1.6) with the initial value vn(0) and the SPDE (1.1) with

the initial value un(0) by replacing a, g by an, gn, associated with n respectively, where

un(0) is determined similarly to u(0) above, see (1.14). Then, we have smooth classical

global-in-time solutions vn, un for such equations. Let u and v denote the solutions of (1.1) and (1.6) in paracontrolled sense associated with ^ for t < T. Noting that n   in

C-1 and using assumptions on , we have, as n  , vn(0) converges to v(0) in C-1,

mn  m and in particular, an, gn converge to a, g on each compact set of R. For the proof

of n   in C-1, we refer to the proof of Corollary 2.7, where a more complex case is

dealt with. Then, noting that un(0)  u(0) in C and using Remark 3.3 at the end of this

article,

we

know

that

un

therefore

for T < T. Since the initial values vn(0) move, we use the continuity of solutions in

initial values. Note that the coefficients an and gn also move. So, we require the condition

see

proof.

In particular, recalling (x) = , 1[0,x]  C-1([0, 1]) so that   C-1(T),  > 0 and also   C4(R) satisfying (1.3), fn(t) := (vn(t))n-1 converges to f (t) := (v(t))-1 in LT-1 and fn(0) = f (0) for all n. We note the lower semi-continuity of (f ) in C-1, which follows from the variational formula for the Dirichlet form:

Then,

fn  f in C-1 implies (f )  limn (fn) if   C1(T), but in the definition of

(f ), we only have  without its derivative so that this property holds also for non-smooth

 by taking the limit m   (in L) or m   (in L) introduced as above. More

precisely, noting that the constant C() in (2.9) can be taken uniformly in n: C(n)  C,

since the constant C() = C() can be estimated only by min  and max , for t < T, we

see

(f

at least if f (0)  H1; recall that fn(0) = f (0) for all n and n   in C-1. For the last inequality, we use n(fn(t))  eCtn(fn(0)) by noting that, for arbitrary small  > 0, m/n, n/  1 +  for large enough n, m. In particular, if |µ| is small enough, one can take C < 0.

15

Finally, we prove T = , which shows the existence of v(t) for all t  0. The above

estimate on (f (t)) implies f (t) H1  M1(eCt/2 + 1) for t < T, if f (0)  H1, for some

M1 > 0.

Indeed, this follows from (f ) =

1 2

f

2 L2

and Lemma 2.8 below (equivalence

of norms). However, by Sobolev's imbedding theorem and noting that H1  H1(T)  H1

from





C (T),

we

have

H1



C-1,  - 1

<

1 2

and

this

shows

v(t) C-1  M2(eCt/2 +

1), t < T. Therefore, noting that u(t) C  2 v(t) C-1 , we see u(t) C  2M2(eCt/2 +

1), t < T. This proves T =  by Lemma 2.5 at least if f (0) = (v(0))-1  H1  H1,

that is, if v(0)  D.

If |µ| is small enough, based on the estimate (2.24) obtained in Proposition 2.6 with c := -C > 0, we can show the exponential decay of v(t) to the unique stationary solution v¯m for each conserved quantity m.

Corollary 2.7. Assume v(0)  D as in Proposition 2.6. Then, if |µ| is small enough, f (t) := (v(t))-1 converges to the constant zm in H1(T) exponentially fast as t  :

(2.25)

f (t) - zm H1  Ce-ct/2 f (0) - zm H1 ,

where m = T v(0, x)dx. We also have

(2.26)

v(t) - v¯m C-1  Ce-ct/2 f (0) - zm H1 .

Proof. By Lemma 2.8 below, under the conservation law, we obtain

f (t) - zm

2 H1



C

f (t)

2 L2

=

2C (f

(t))

 2Ce-ct(f (0))  Ce-ct

f (0) - zm

2 H1

.

This shows the desired estimate on f (t) - zm H1, since the norm of H1 is equivalent to that of H1 due to the boundedness of (x).

In order to give the estimate (2.26) on v(t), we first show the uniform boundedness of v(t) C-1 in t  0, i.e.,

(2.27)

sup v(t) C-1 < .
t0

By the assumption (1.3) on , we have that -1(v) C-1  C(1 + v C-1 ), v  C-1. Therefore, recalling that v(t) = -1(f (t)) and using Sobolev's imbedding theorem, we have that

v(t) C-1  C(1 + f (t) C-1 )  C(1 + f (t) C-1  C-1 )  C(1 +  C-1 f (t) H1 ).
Recall that the constant C changes from line to line. So, by (2.25), we obtain (2.27). Thus, by noting (2.27), we take a function -1  C2(R) with compact support such that -1(f (t)) = v(t) for all t > 0 and -1(zm) = v¯m(= -1(zm)). Then, Lemma 9 of [3] gives that

v(t) - v¯m C-1 = -1(f (t)) - -1(zm) C-1

16

 -1 C2 (1 + zm C-1 ) (f (t) - zm) C-1  -1 C2 (1 + zm C-1 )  C-1 (f (t) - zm) H1 .
Consequently, noting that -1 C2 is independent of t  0, we obtain the desired result (2.26) by (2.25).

The following lemma was used in the proof of Proposition 2.6 and Corollary 2.7.
Lemma 2.8. Assume the following condition for f = f (x)  H1, which comes from the conservation law:

(2.28) Then, we have

(-1(f ) - -1(zm))dx = 0.
T

(2.29)

f - zm L2  C f L2 ,

for some C > 0. In particular, under the condition (2.28), the Sobolev norm f - zm H1 is equivalent to f L2 .

Proof. First, note that, by mean value theorem applied for (2.28), we see zm = f (y) for some y  T. Indeed, by noting the monotone increasing property of -1, we see

-1(min f · )dx  -1(f )dx = -1(zm)dx  -1(max f · )dx

and this implies min f  zm  max f . Therefore, we have

Since 0 <   C(T), this implies (2.29).

The next lemma gives an initial layer type result. This is used to remove the

condition v(0)  D in Proposition 2.6 and Corollary 2.7. Recall that we only assume





C -2 (T),





(

,

3 2

).

Lemma 2.9. For every initial value v(0)  C-1 and all t  (0, T), the solution v(t)  C-1 of the SPDE (1.6) in paracontrolled sense satisfies f (t) := (v(t))-1  H1, that is,
v(t)  D. In other words, even if f (0) / H1, immediately after, we have f (t)  H1, t > 0

and this proves T =  by Proposition 2.6.

17

Proof. If  is smooth, taking any u0 such that u0 + m = v0 for given v0, we have from (1.1) with a = (· + m) and g = (· + m)

tu = (v)v + (v) = f + µf.

This is an integrated form of (2.4). Therefore, we have

t

u(t) - u(0) =  f (s)ds + µ f (s)ds

or we can rewrite this as

(2.30)

t

f (s, x)ds = (x)-1 u(t, x) - u(0, x) - µ f (s, x)ds .

The right hand side belongs to C-1, since -1  C-1, u(t)  C and f (s)  C([0, T ], C-1). On the other hand, in the left hand side, f (s)  C([0, T ], C-2), T < T, since (v(s))  LT-1, -1  C-1. Therefore, taking the limit in ^, we have (2.30) for t < T, if we interpret the left hand side as a Bochner integral in C-2.

First note that

t

t

f (s, x)ds =  f (s, x)ds,

0

0

where the integrals are Bochner integrals in C-2 for the left hand side and C-1 for the

right hand side. (This can be shown by regarding both sides as generalized functions and

by multiplying test function .)

Thus, (2.30) implies 

t 0

f

(s,

x)ds



C([0, T ], C-1),

since the right hand side of (2.30) is in this class. This shows, by also noting an obvious

relation

t 0

f (s,

x)ds



C ([0,

T

],

C -1 ),

that

t
f (s, x)ds  C([0, T ], C).
0

Recall that the left hand side is defined as a Bochner integral in C-1 and ^ is already general.

Since f  C([0, T ], C-1), for every t  (0, T), by mean value theorem applied in the space C-1, we see that there exists  = t  (0, t) such that

(2.31)

1 t

holds.

However,

since

the

side

belongs

to

C

and





(

,

),

we

see

f (t)



C

and, in particular, f (t)  H1. Once we have f (t)  H1, taking the initial value of v

as v(t), by Proposition 2.6, we see f (s)  H1 for every s  t and the solution exists

globally in time. Since we can take t  (0, T) arbitrary small, this shows the conclusion,

recalling the flow property, see Remark 2.4.

Remark 2.5. We can decompose v through  as (v) = f ·  and the bad regularity v  C-1 comes only from  in  and, by Lemma 2.9, f is a good part. Recall that Tsatsoulis and Weber [17] decomposed the solution of P ()-dynamics on T2 into the sum of OU-part and good part. Since we deal with quasilinear equation, our decomposition is nonlinear, but in a sense, similar to this.

18

Now we can easily complete the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. The conclusion follows immediately by combining Proposition 2.6,
Corollary 2.7 and Lemma 2.9. Here we only give a short explanation for (1.11). We first note that, since v  C([0, ), C-1), we have

(2.32)

sup v(t) - v¯m C-1 < .
t[0,1]

On the other hand, by Lemma 2.9, we have f (1) = (v(1))-1  H1. In particular, v(1)  v(1, v0)  D so that the condition of Corollary 2.7 is satisfied. Therefore, by the flow property and (2.26), for t > 1, we obtain

v(t) - v¯m C-1 = v(t - 1, v(1, v0)) - v¯m C-1  Ce-c(t-1)/2 f (1) - v¯m H1 , t > 1,
which implies (1.11) by noting (2.32).

2.3 Global existence and asymptotic behavior of u(t) as t  

We can apply the result for v(t) to study the global-in-time existence and the asymptotic
behavior of u(t). First we note that u(t) can be recovered from v(t) := u(t) at least when   C(T), cf. Subsection 1.4. Note that m = 0 under this choice.

Lemma 2.10.

Assume





C (T)

and

let

the

initial

value

C, 



(

(1.1)

x

T

0

T

where we regard T = [0, 1) especially in the first and third terms of the right hand side. Then, u(t) solves the SPDE (1.1) with a =  and g = .

Proof. First, note that u(t, x) defined by (2.33) satisfies the initial condition:

x

u(0, x) = u0(y)dy + u0(y)dy - (1 - y)u0(y)dy = u0(x).

0

T

T

To see that it satisfies the SPDE (1.1), writing the sum of the second to fourth terms in the right hand of (2.33) as A(t), we have

x
tu(t, x) = tv(t, y)dy + tA(t)
0 x
= [{(v)} + {(v)}]dy + tA(t)
0
= {(v)}(t, x) - {(v)}(t, 0) + (v(t, x))(x) - (v(t, 0))(0) + tA(t).

Since u = v holds for u defined by (2.33), we have {(v)} = a(u)u and (v) = g(u). Therefore, to complete the proof of the lemma, it is enough to show

(2.34)

tA(t) = {(v)}(t, 0) + (v(t, 0))(0).

19

However,

tA(t) = - (1 - y)tv(t, y)dy + (v(t, y))(y)dy

T

= - (1 - y)[{(v)} + {(v)}]dy + (v(t, y))(y)dy

T

= [{(v)} + (v)](t, 0),

which shows (2.34).

Remark 2.6. When   C-2, the last term in the right hand side of (2.33) is well-

defined even for general  in the sense that the other four terms are all well-defined. But,

to look at it by itself especially without time integral, the product (v(s)) is ill-posed in

a classical sense, since (v(s))  C-1

and





C -2

with





(

4 3

,

3 2

).

However, when

 = , this product turns out to be well-defined. Indeed, in this case, (v(t)) = f (t) with

f (t)  H1 for every t > 0 by Lemma 2.9. Accordingly, the last term of (2.33) without time

integral can be interpreted as H1 f (t),  H-1, t > 0 if  can be regarded as an element of H-1. Noting that   C-1,   C-2 and ( - 1) + ( - 2) < 0, in general, the

product  is ill-posed. However, in our special case, we will see that  is well-defined

as an element of C-2 and then, in particular,   H-1 because of C-2  H-1. This

gives the motivation for the following proof of Theorem 1.2.

We now give the proof of Theorem 1.2.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. The global-in-time existence of u(t) is clear from T =  noted in Lemma 2.9. In the rest, we assume |µ| is sufficiently small as in Theorem 1.1.
As we mentioned in Remark 2.6, we have to show that the term H1 f (t),  H-1 (or equivalently the term ) is well-defined. For this, we apply Lemma 2.10 by introducing
an approximation of u(t) as in the proof of Proposition 2.6. Since Lemma 2.10 holds for v0  C-1, in the following, we consider the initial values un(0) = u0  C for all n. Note that, we just have v(0) = u0  C-1, which does not imply v(0)  D.
Take a sequence of enhanced noises ^n such that n  C(T) and ^n converges to ^ in C-2 × C2-3 as n  . Then, the associated solution un converges to u in LT . Since T = , one can take T > 0 arbitrarily large and, in particular, we have for every t  0,

(2.35)

un(t) - u(t) C  0 (n  ).

Since n  C(T), by Lemma 2.10, we have the formula (2.33) for un(t, x) by replacing v,  by vn := un, n, respectively, in the right hand side, which we denote as An1 (t, x) + A2 - An3 (t) + An4 (t). Recall that we take a =  and g =  =  here. We also denote fn(t, x) := (vn(t, x))n-1(x) and n := n. Then, we see fn(t, x)  f (t, x) := (v(t, x))-1(x) in LT-1 as before, where  = .
Noting that n  C(T) and (1.8), we have nn = µn - n, which are well-defined as the elements of C-2 and then

nn - mm C-2 = µn - n - (µm - m) C-2

20

|µn - µm|+ n - m C-2 |µn - µm|+C n - m C-1 ,
where µn := µn. Therefore, we see that nn is a Cauchy sequence of C-2 by noting that n   in C-1 and µn  µ = µ as n  . In the sequel, we denote by  the limit of the sequence nn in C-2. So, we have   C-2 and in particular,   H-1.
Using the above notation, we claim that

(2.36)

nlim{An1 (t, x) - An3 (t) + An4 (t)}

By Lemma 2.9, we know f (t)  H1 and

So, H1

For An1 (t, x), we have An1 (t, x)  A1(t, x) in C([0, T ], C), T > 0 as n  . Indeed,

we

 vn(t) - v(t) L + vn(t) - v(t) C-1 2 vn(t) - v(t) C-1 ,

where An1 (t) = vn(t) and A1(t) = v(t) have been used for the second equation. There-

fore, noting that vn(t)  v(t) in LT-1, we obtain the desired result. Finally for An3 (t), by

similar

arguments,

it

easy

to

see

|An3 (t)-A3(t)|

vn(t)-v(t)

L

vn(t)-v(t)

C-1 ,

which implies that An3 (t) converges uniformly to A3(t) on any compact interval [0, T ]. As

a consequence, the proof of (2.36) is completed.

Combining (2.35) with (2.36), we have

u(t, x) = A1(t, x) + A2 - A3(t) + A4(t).

We now show the uniform boundedness of A1(t) C +|A3(t)| in t  0, that is,

(2.38)

sup{ A1(t) C +|A3(t)|} < .
t0

Indeed, this can be easily shown by Theorem 1.1. By similar arguments for convergences above, we easily have

A1(t) C +|A3(t)| C v(t) C-1 , t  0.
Noting that T v0(y)dy = T u0(y)dy = 0 (= m) and |µ|= |µ| is sufficiently small, Theorem 1.1 gives that
v(t) C-1  v¯0 C-1 +Ce-ct,
where v¯0 is defined by (1.10) with m = 0. Therefore, we have supt0 v(t) C <  and (2.38) is shown.
Noting that A2 is a constant, in order to show (1.12), it is sufficient to show

(2.39)

sup|A4(t) - z0µt|< .
t0

Let us rewrite A4(t) as follows.

(2.40)

t
A4(t) = z0tH1 1,  H-1 + r(s)ds,
0

where z0 is determined by (1.9) with m = 0 and r(s) := H1 f (s)-z0,  H-1. By analogous arguments for (1.11), see the proof of Theorem 1.1, we have

(2.41)

|r(s)| Ce-cs/2  H-1 f (1) - z0 H1 , s  1.

holds for some c > 0, where Corollary 2.7 and f (1)  H1 have been used; recall that |µ| is sufficiently small. Noting that

and using (2.41), we see

where the periodicity of n has been used for the third equation. Consequently, summarizing the above estimates, we have (2.39) and complete the proof of Theorem 1.2.

3 Continuity of the solution u(t) of (1.1) in initial values

In this section, we give the proof of Theorem 1.3. As in [7] and stated in Remark 3.2,

Theorem 1.3 follows from Theorem 3.1 below, which is the main result of this section.

Since this part is a continuation of [7], the same notations as in [7] will be mostly used.

We

assume





(

1 3

,



-

1),





(2

+ 1, 

+ ),

and

use

notations

K0,

K(

u

,, )

and

K( u1 ,,, u2 ,,) introduced at the end of Section 2 of [7], which may change from

line to line. We still write a b for two non-negative functions a and b if there exists a con-

stant C > 0 independent of the variables under consideration such that a  Cb. In addi-
tion, to emphasize the initial value, we sometimes write K0( u0 C ), K0( u10 C , u20 C ) for K0.

Noting that Theorem 1.3 is about the continuity of the local-in-time solutions on

initial values and recalling Lemma 1.4, for simplicity but without loss of generality, we
may assume the coefficients a, g  Cb3(R) with (1.2) in the sequel, which are same as in [7].

Let C,,(X) be the family of functions controlled by X, that is,

C,,(X) := {(u, u); u = ¯ uX + u, (u, u) ,,< },

where ¯ uX denotes the modified paraproduct of u and X = (-)-1Q, see Section 2 of

[7] and

(u, u) ,, :=

u

LT +

u

-

LT +

sup
0<tT

t

u(t) C .

Noting that u is a function of u and u, we used the space C,,(X) and the norm

(u, u) ,, in [7], which are equivalent to the above. For the given initial value u0, we

impose additional

conditions

u(0)

=

u0,

u(0)

=

g (u0 ) a(u0 )

and

define the (skew

product)

space X by

X :=

(u0, u, u)



C

×

C,,; (u, u)

satisfies

u(0)

=

u0, u(0)

=

g(u0) a(u0)

,

which is viewed as a metric space embedded in the Banach space C × C,, equipped with the norm

(u0, u) C×C,, := u0 C + u , C,, u = (u, u).

Let L0 := t - a(uT0 ), uT0 := eT u0, where et denotes the semigroup generated by  on T. Let us now define the map  from X into itself by

(3.1)

 : (u0, u, u)  X  (u0, v, v)  X ,

23

where

(3.2) (3.3)

v

= g(u)

(a(u) - a(uT0 )

a(uT0

))u

L0v =a(uT0 )v  - L0(¯ z X) + g(u)(u, ) - a(u)(u, ¯ u)

+ (a(u) - a(uT0 ))u + 

=:a(uT0 )v  - L0(¯ zX) + 1(u, u) + 2(u, u) + (u, u),

where 1 denotes the difference of the third and the fourth terms, 2 denotes the fifth term in the right hand of (3.3), and  denotes the remainder, see Lemma 3.3 and (2.32) of [7]
for details.

Remark 3.1. The map  defined by (3.1) is a little different from the original one introduced in [7], where the map  : (u, u)  (v, v) defined on C,,(X) := {(u, u); u = ¯ u X + u, (u, u) ,,< } (more precisely on the space BT (), see Subsection 3.1 of [7] or equivalently (3.4) below) is introduced, see (2.16)-(2.18) in [7]. As we pointed out
at the end of Section 3 of [7], the space C,,(X) is actually identical to that of pairs (u, u) with the norm (u, u) ,, defined in terms of (u, u). In this way, C,,(X) is
identified with C,,. Therefore, Theorem 3.1 of [7] holds for  defined by (3.1) whenever the initial value is fixed and we will not repeat this fact in the sequel.

For  > 0 and T > 0, set

(3.4)

BT () := (u0, u)  X ; u0  C, u ,,   .

We recall that for each fixed initial value u0, in [7], it is proved that the map  is contractive on BT () for a large enough  and a small time T > 0, and the unique fixed point on BT () solves the paracontrolled SPDE (1.1) up to time T > 0, see Theorem 3.1 of [7] or Theorem 2.4 for details. In particular, one explicit choice of  and T is given in
Theorem 2.4. Let us now give the main result of this section.

Theorem

3.1.

Let





(

13 9

,

3 2

).

Then, we have that the map  defined by (3.1) de-

pends continuously on the initial value u0 and its contractivity on BT (), T > 0 is lo-

cally uniform in initial values. More precisely, there exists a unique continuous map

u0  C  (u(u0), u(u0))  C,, up to time T such that

(u0, u(u0), u(u0)) = (u0, u(u0), u(u0))

and (u(u0), u(u0)) (or equivalently (u(u0), u(u0))) solves the SPDE (1.1) starting from u0 up to time T in the paracontrolled sense. Moreover, T can be taken depending continuously on u0 C and ^ . C-2×C2-3

Remark 3.2. (i) Combining Theorem 3.1-(ii) of [7] with Theorem 3.1 above, we see that the map  depends continuously on both the initial value u0  C and the enhanced noise ^. In particular, the unique fixed point of  in BT () inherits the continuity in (^, u0). (ii) Theorem 1.3 immediately follows from Theorem 3.1 and the relation between  and
the solution u(t), see the proof of Theorem 1.1 in [7] for detailed explanation.

24

(iii) To obtain the estimate (3.13) in the proof of Lemma 3.8 below, which is important for

the

proof

of

Theorem

3.1,

the

original

assumption





(

4 3

,

3 2

)

in

[7]

is

changed

to





(

13 9

,

3 2

)

due to our techniques. Although the assumption on  becomes slightly restrictive, the most

important case of the spatial white noise on T is covered.

We can obtain immediately the next result by Theorem 3.1.

Corollary 3.2. The SPDE (1.1) is solvable up to time T > 0 and one can take T = T ( u0 C , ^ C-2×C2-3 ), which depends continuously on u0 C and ^ . C-2×C2-3

To prove Theorem 3.1, thanks to Theorem 3.1 in [7] and the implicit function theorem, the main task is to show the continuity of the map . We will first give some lemmas as preparation and postpone the proof of Theorem 3.1 to the end of this section.
Since the main purpose of this section is to prove the continuity of u(t) in its initial values, we have to consider different initial values. So, we first generalize (2.15) in Lemma 2.9 of [7] to the next lemma.
Lemma 3.3. Let F  Cb2(R),   (1, 2) and   (0,  - 1]. Then, for any u, v  LT (without the restriction u(0) = v(0)), we have

F (u) - F (v) LT

--1
T 2 F C2 (1 + u LT ) u - v LT + F C2 (1 + u(0) C ) u(0) - v(0) C .

Proof. This lemma can be easily shown by modifying the proof of Lemma 9 of [3]. Although we do not assume u(0) = v(0), refining the proof of Lemma 9 of [3], we deduce that

F (u) - F (v) LT

--1
T 2 F C2 (1 + u ) LT-1 u - v LT-1 + F (u(0)) - F (v(0)) C ,

which gives the desired result by Lemmas 2.3 and 2.9 of [7].

As an application of Lemma 3.3, we have the following lemma, which will be used frequently.

Lemma 3.4. For any (ui0, ui, ui)  BT (), i = 1, 2, we have

(3.5)

a(u1) - a(u10,T ) - a(u2) - a(u20,T ) LT

--1
T 2 K( u1 ,,)(1 +

 C-2 )2 u1 - u2 ,, +K0( u10

C ) u10 - u20 C .

Proof. By Lemma 2.9-(i) and Lemma 3.2-(i) of [7], we have that for any   (0,  - 1],

(3.6)

a(u10,T ) - a(u20,T ) C

(1 + u10,T C+1 ) u10,T - u20,T C+1 (1 + u10 C ) u10 - u20 C .

On the other hand, Lemma 3.3 gives that

a(u1) - a(u2) LT

--1
T 2 (1 +

u1 LT ) u1 - u2 LT +(1 +

u10 C ) u10 - u20 C .

25

Therefore, by the estimate u LT (1 + X C ) u ,, , see (3.9) in [7], together with X C  C-2 , we immediately obtain (3.5) with K( u1 ,,) = (1 + u1 ,,) and K0( u10 C ) = (1 + u10 C ).

According to Theorem 3.1 of [7] and its proof, we have the following result.

Lemma 3.5. Let  be the map on BT () defined by (3.1), that is, (u0, u, u) = (u0, v, v) for (u0, u, u)  BT (). Then, we have

(v, v) ,,

+-
T 2 K(

u

,, )K~1(X, ) + K0(

u0

C )(1 +



C-2 ),

where v are v are determined by (3.2) and (3.3) respectively, and K~1(X, ) denotes the same constant as that introduced in Proposition 3.7 of [7].

By Lemma 3.5, in particular, we know that v is well-defined as an element of LT for each (u0, u, u)  BT (). In the following, we will show the local Lipschitz continuity of v in (u0, u, u). For (ui0, ui, ui)  BT (), i = 1, 2, we set (ui0, ui, ui) = (ui0, vi, vi) in the following.

Lemma 3.6. We have that v is locally Lipschitz in (u0, u, u)  BT (). More precisely, we have

v1 - v2 LT

--1
T 2 K( u1 ,, ,

u2 ,,)(1 +

 C-2 )2 u1 - u2 ,,

+ K( u1 ,, )K0( u10 C , u20 C ) u10 - u20 C ,

where ui = (ui, ui) for i = 1, 2.

Proof. For simplicity of notation, we set

(3.7)

b(ui) = a(ui) - a(ui0,T ), i = 1, 2.

Then, it is easy to know that v1 - v2 LT is bounded from above by the sum of the following three terms:

I1 =

(g(u1) - b(u1)u1)

1 a(u10,T )

-

Let us first deal with the first term I1. From the proof of Lemma 3.4 of [7], it easily follows that

Recalling that a  Cb3(R) satisfies (1.2) and using (3.6) together with Lemma 2.9 of [7], we have that

where we have been used the estimate

(3.8)

1 a(ui0,T ) C

(1 + ui0 C ), i = 1, 2,

see (3.23) of [7], for the second inequality.

Therefore, by Lemma 2.1 of [7] and the above estimates, we obtain

Next, let us evaluate the second term I2. By Lemma 3.4, we have

(b(u1) - b(u2))u1 LT
--1
T 2 K( u1 ,, )(1 +

 C-2 )2 u1 - u2 ,, +K0( u10 C ) u1 ,,

In addition, we have the following estimate more easily.

g(u1) - g(u2) LT

--1
T 2 K( u1 ,,)(1 +

 C-2 )2 u1 - u2 ,,

+ K0( u10 C ) u10 - u20 C .

Therefore, noting (3.8), we have

I2

--1
T 2 K( u1 ,, ,

u20 C )(1 +

 C-2 )2 u1 - u2 ,,

+ K0( u10 C , u20 C )(1 + u1 ,, ) u10 - u20 C .

Finally, using (3.17) of [7] together with (3.8), we easily have

--1
I3 T 2 K( u2 ,, )(1 +  C-2 ) u1 - u2 ,, .

Consequently, the proof of this lemma is completed by the above estimates.

In the next two lemmas, we give the bounds for the terms involving both uT0 or (and) v, which should be evaluated in the weighted space in time.

Lemma 3.7. We have

-
sup t 2
0<tT

(a(u10,T ) - a(u20,T ))v1 (t) C-2

K0( u10 C ) (v1 , v1 ) ,, u10 - u20 C .

27

Proof. By Lemma 3.5, we know (v1 , v1)  C,,. In particular, we have that for t > 0, v1  C. Then, noting that 0 <  +  - 2 <  and using Lemma 2.4 of [7], we have

(a(u10,T ) - a(u20,T ))v1 (t) C-2

(a(u10,T ) - a(u20,T ))v1 (t) C+-2 a(u10,T ) - a(u20,T ) C v1 (t) C .

Now,

K0( u10 C ) (v1 , v1 ) ,,  C-2 u10 - u20 C .

Proof. R2(v1 ,

sake of brevity. Using the the commutator - (T)), see (2.1) of [7], we have

(3.10)

R2(v1 , X) CT C+-2

v1 CT C  C-2

by Lemma 2.6 of [7] and

a0¯ v1 X = a0(¯ v1 (X) + R2(v1 , X)) = - a0¯ v1  + a0R2(v1 , X). Then, an analogous argument for (2.26) of [7] shows that

a0¯ v1 X = -a0v1  - (a0, ¯ v1 ) - R(a0, v1 ; ) - ¯ v1 a0 + a0R2(v1 , X),

see Lemma 2.8 of [7] for the meaning of R(a0, v1 ; ). Therefore, the term inside of the norm · C+-2 of the left hand side of (3.9) equals to

(3.11)

-(a0, ¯ v1 ) - R(a0, v1 ; ) - ¯ v1 a0 + a0R2(v1 , X).

Let us first deal with the Lemmas 2.9 and 3.2 of [7],

first term of (3.11), i.e., we have for  <

Next, we deal with the last three terms of (3.11). By (3.6) and the similar arguments to Lemma 4.3 of [7], we easily have

(3.14)

-R(a0, v1 , ) - ¯ u a0 + a0R2(v1 , X) CT C+-2 (1 + u10 C ) v1 LT  C-2 u10 - u20 C .

We omit the details and just give the estimate on the last term a0R2(v1 , X) as an example. Noting the relation 0 < 2 +  - 3 <  - 1 and using (3.10), we have

a0R2(v1 , X) CT C+-2

a0R2(v1 , X) CT C2+-3 a0 C-1 R2(v1 , X) CT C+-2
(1 + u10 C ) v1 LT  C-2 u10 - u20 C ,

where (3.6) has been used for the last inequality. As a consequence, we conclude the proof of this lemma by (3.13) and (3.14) together with  > .

Next, we reevaluate the term 2 involving u according to our purpose.

Lemma 3.9. We have the local Lipschitz estimate for 2:

(3.15)

-
sup t 2 2(u1) - 2(u2) C-2
0<tT

--1
T 2 K( u1 ,, ,

u2 ,,)(1 +

 C-2 )2 u1 - u2 ,,

+ K0( u10 C ) u1 ,, u10 - u20 C .

Proof. This lemma can be shown essentially by analogous arguments to Lemma 3.3 of [7]. However, in that proof, the initial value is fixed and the explicit relation between the constants and its initial value is not written down. Hence, for the reader's convenience, we give proof of (3.15) briefly. In the following, we use the notation b(ui) introduced in the proof of Lemma 3.6, see (3.7). By the definition of 2, we have

(2(u1) - 2(u2))(t) C-2

(2(u1) - 2(u2))(t) C+-2 b(u1) - b(u2) LT u1(t) C + b(u2) LT (u1 - u2)(t) C .

Therefore, the estimate (3.15) is immediately obtained by Lemma 3.4 above and (3.17) of [7].

As the final preparation, we give the estimate on the remainder  in (3.3).

29

Lemma 3.10. We have that  is locally Lipschitz continuous in (u0, u, u)  BT (). In fact, we have the following estimate

-
sup t 2 ((u1) - (u2))(t) C+-2
0<tT

K( u1 ,,, u2 ,, )K~2(X, ) u1 - u2 ,, + K0( u10 C ) u1 ,,  C-2 u10 - u20 C ,

where K~2(X, ) is the constant introduced in Proposition 3.7 of [7], which depends on  C-2 and (X, ) . C2-3

Proof. This can be shown by similar arguments to Proposition 3.7 of [7]. Although many

terms should be dealt with, from the proof of Proposition 3.7 of [7], we only have to reevaluate the terms involving uT0 , that is, (a(uT0 ), ¯ u ) and the term A2 defined by (2.27) of [7]. Since we use the norm of u1 - u2 ,,, the initial value will only affect our

estimate when Proposition 3.7

the estimates of b(ui) LT and of [7], where b(ui) is defined by

b(u1 (3.7).

) - b(u2) However,

LtTheatreermussed(ian(thueT0p)r,o¯ouf

of )

and A2 can be handled by the analogous arguments to Lemma 3.8 above, and Lemma 4.3

of [7]. Noting u  LT , a similar argument to (3.13) yields that

-
sup t 2
0<tT

(a(u10,T ), ¯ u1 ) - (a(u20,T ), ¯ u1 ) (t) C+-2

(1 + u10 C ) u1 LT  C-2 u10 - u20 C .

Then, recalling the estimate deduced in the proof of Lemma 4.1 of [7] and the bilinearity of the resonant term, we easily have

-
sup t 2
0<tT

(a(u10,T ), ¯ u1 ) - (a(u20,T ), ¯ u2 ) (t) C+-2

K0( u10 C ) u1 ,,  C-2 u10 - u20 C .

On the other hand, A2 can be essentially evaluated by the arguments for Lemma 4.3 of [7] thanks to Lemma 3.4. Here, we give the estimate on the first term of A2 as an example. By bilinearity of R, we have

R(b(u1), u1; ) - R(b(u2), u2; ) CT C+-2 R(b(u1) - b(u2), u1; ) + CT C+-2 R(b(u2), u1 - u2; ) CT C+-2 K( u1 ,, , u2 ,, )(1 +  C-2 )2  C-2 u1 - u2 ,, + K0( u10 C ) u1 ,,  C-2 u10 - u20 C ,
where Lemma 3.4 and  -  - 1 > 0 have been used for the last inequality. Consequently, we complete the proof.

In the end, let us give the proof of Theorem 3.1 based on the above lemmas.

Proof of Theorem 3.1. According to the proof of Theorem 3.1 of [7], we also know that the choice of T depends locally uniformly on u~0 - u0 C according to the estimates (3.48) and (3.50) of [7]. In fact, noting that constants K( u ,,) in (3.48) of [7] and

30

K( u1 ,, , u1 ,,) in (3.50) of [7] can be controlled by some polynomial, we can choose the time T as the function T = T (r) for all u~0 - u0 C < r with a small enough r > 0. In particular, we know that  is contractive on BT () for a large enough  and a small enough T > 0, that is, there exists   (0, 1) such that

(u0, u1, u1) - (u0, u2, u2) ,,  u1 - u2 ,, , (u0, ui)  BT ().

Note that u0 in  is the same in this estimate. Therefore, thanks to the implicit function theorem, it is enough for us to show the continuity of the map  on BT (). In fact, we can show that the map  is locally Lipschitz continuous on BT (). Let us take two elements (ui0, ui)  BT (), i = 1, 2 and denote their images by (ui0, vi, vi) under the map . Then by (3.1)-(3.3), we have that the different v1 - v2 satisfies the equation
L01v1 - L02v2 =a(u10,T )v1  - a(u20,T )v2  - (L01(¯ z1 X) - L02(¯ z2 X)) + 1(u1) - 1(u2) + 2(u1) - 2(u2) + (u1) - (u2)

with the initial value (v1 - v2 )(0) = u10 - u20 - u1(0)-u2(0)X  C; recall that v0i =

ui0, vi(0)

= ui(0) =

g (ui0 ) a(ui0 )

,

i = 1, 2,

where L0i

:= t - a(ui0,T ).

We

easily

see that

it

can

be rewritten to the next equation.

(3.16)

L02(v1 - v2 ) =a(u20,T )(v1 -v2 ) - L02(¯ v1 -v2 X) + (a(u10,T ) - a(u20,T ))v1 + (a(uT0,1) - a(uT0,2))¯ v1 X + (a(u10,T )-a(u20,T ))v1 
+ 1(u1) - 1(u2) + 2(u1) - 2(u2) + (u1) - (u2).

By Lemma 2.10 of [7] and v1 - v2  LT , we see the first two terms of (3.16) can be estimated as follows:

(3.17)

-
sup t 2
0<tT

(a(u20,T )(v1 -v2 ) - L02(¯ v1 -v2 X))(t) C+-2

(1 + u20 C ) v1 - v2 LT X C .

As we explained in Lemma 3.10, the estimate (3.7) in Lemma 3.3 of [7] still holds for 1(u1) - 1(u2) in the framework of this theorem. More precisely, we have

(3.18)

-
sup t 2 (1(u1) - 1(u2))(t) C2-3
0<tT
K( u1 ,, , u2 ,, )(1 +  C-2 )2  C-2 u1 - u2 ,, .

Now let us denote by 1(t) the sum of (a(u10,T ) - a(u20,T ))v1 (t) and (2(u1) - 2(u2))(t), and by 2(t) all of the other terms in the right hand side of (3.16). Then by (3.17), (3.18) and Lemmas 3.5-3.10, we easily known that 1  C((0, T ], C-2) and 2  C((0, T ], C+-2) satisfy the assumptions formulated in Lemma 3.5 of [7]. So we
obtain

(3.19)

-
sup t 2

On the other hand, using Lemmas 2.1 and 2.9 of [7], we have

Therefore, thanks to Lemmas 3.5 and 3.6, by (3.19) together with 0 < + - < - -1, we have that

(u10, u1, u1) - (u20, u2, u2) ,,

which implies the local Lipschitz continuity of  on BT (r, ). Consequently, the proof is completed.

Remark 3.3. In the proof of Proposition 2.6, we used the continuity of the solutions in (m, u0, ^) of the SPDE

(3.20)

tu = a(u + m)u + g(u + m) · ,

where m  R. Although we took m = 0 and fixed it in Theorem 3.1, the continuity of the solutions in (m, u0, ^) of the SPDE (3.20) can be shown by similar arguments. Roughly speaking, instead of the map  defined by (3.1), it is natural to study the map  : (m, u0, u, u)  (v, v), where v, v are determined by (3.2), (3.3) by replacing a(·), g(·)
by a(· + m), g(· + m) respectively. Then, all of the estimates in Lemmas 3.4-3.10 still hold if we replace ui ,, , u1 - u2 ,, , ui0 C , u10 - u20 C by ui ,, +|mi|, u1 - u2 ,,+|m1 - m2|, ui0 C +|mi|, u10 - u20 C +|m1 - m2| respectively. For example, if (mi, ui0, ui, ui), i = 1, 2 are given, then instead of (3.5) in Lemma 3.4, we have

a(u1 + m1) - a(u10,T + m1) - a(u2 + m2) - a(u20,T + m2) LT

T 2 K( u1

C-2 )2( u1 - u2

,,+|m1 - m2|)

+ K0( u10 C , |m1|)( u10 - u20 C +|m1 - m2|),

because we just replaced the functions a(ui), a(ui0,T ) by a(ui + mi), a(ui0,T + mi) and a(· + m) satisfies (1.2) for all m  R. Consequently, we can testify that  satisfies the conditions of the implicit function theorem by the analogous arguments to the proof of Theorem 3.1 and therefore show the desired result.
One can interpret the continuity in m as that in the boundary condition, modified as in (1.6) of [7], for the original SPDE (1.1).
