## Abstract

Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are nonequilibrium phases of matter characterized by robust subharmonic order parameter dynamics. We report a new type of DTC in a periodically driven surface code, the subharmonic signature of which is only observable with respect to some nonlocal order parameter. By modifying the commonly used metrics for characterizing ordinary DTCs, i.e., the spectral functions, spin-glass order parameters, and two-point correlators, we numerically investigate the different phases of the proposed system. Specifically, depending on the system parameters and boundary conditions, we find that the system may fall into either a "surface code" phase, trivial paramagnet phase, nonlocal period-doubling DTC phase, or nonlocal period-quadrupling DTC phase.
