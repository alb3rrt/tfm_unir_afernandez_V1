## Abstract

The atmospheric neutrino flux includes a component from the prompt decay of charmed hadrons that becomes significant only at $E\ge 10$ TeV. At these energies, however, the diffuse flux of cosmic neutrinos discovered by IceCube seems to be larger than the atmospheric one. Here we study the possibility to detect a neutrino interaction in downgoing atmospheric events at km$^3$ telescopes. The neutrino signal will always appear together with a muon bundle that reveals its atmospheric origin and, generically, it implies an increase in the detector activity with the slant depth. We propose a simple algorithm that could separate these events from regular muon bundles.
