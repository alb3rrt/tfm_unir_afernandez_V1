COMBINATORIAL NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR REGULAR GRAPHS TO INDUCE PERIODIC QUANTUM WALKS
SHO KUBOTA1

arXiv:2106.00166v1 [math.CO] 1 Jun 2021

Abstract. We derive combinatorial necessary conditions for discrete-time quantum walks defined by regular mixed graphs to be periodic. If the quantum walk is periodic, all the eigenvalues of the time evolution matrices must be algebraic integers. Focusing on this, we explore which ring the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials should belong to. On the other hand, the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials of -Hermitian adjacency matrices have combinatorial implications. From these, we can find combinatorial implications in the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials of the time evolution matrices, and thus derive combinatorial necessary conditions for mixed graphs to be periodic. For example, if a k-regular mixed graph with n vertices is periodic, then 2n/k must be an integer. As an application of this work, we determine periodicity of mixed complete graphs and mixed graphs with a prime number of vertices.

1. Introduction

Let  = (V, E) be an undirected graph with the vertex set V and the edge set E.

Define A = A() = {(x, y), (y, x) | {x, y}  E()}, which is the set of the symmetric

arcs of . The origin and terminus of a = (x, y)  A are denoted by o(a), t(a), respec-

tively. We express a-1 as the reverse arc of a. Define the matrix U = U ()  CA×A

by

Ua,b

=

2 deg

t(b)

o(a),t(b)

- a,b-1 ,

where x,y is the Kronecker delta symbol. Consider the 3-cycle C3 for example. Then

we have

0 0 1 0 0 0

1 0 0 0 0 0





U

=

U (C3)

=

0  0

1 0

0 0

0 0

0 1

0  0

.





0 0 0 0 0 1

000100

In this case, the matrix U is a block diagonal matrix whose diagonal blocks are lined with permutation matrices. Thus we see that U3 = I, where I is the identity matrix.

Table 2. Previous works on periodicity for other models

We consider the question of whether there exists   N such that U() = I for various graphs. This is nothing but the question of periodicity of discrete-time quantum walks.

1.1. Previous works on periodicity of quantum walks. The topic discussed in this paper is periodicity of discrete-time quantum walks. See Table 1. Many studies in the Grover walk model are carried out. Studies of periodicity in other models are summarized in Table 2. Very recently, periodicity of mixed graphs has been studied, and periodicity of the mixed paths and the mixed cycles was completely determined [23]. State transfer, which is a more generalized problem of periodicity, is discussed in [3, 46].
Studies of periodicity in continuous-time quantum walks are in [5, 39] for example. In continuous-time, there is a lot of research into state transfer. We refer to Godsil's survey [6]. Recent studies on state transfer are in [2, 27, 29, 31, 40, 42].

1.2. Main Results. The main goal of this study is to determine periodicity of the

mixed complete graphs. In the case of undirected graphs, there is only one complete

graph

for

n,

whereas,

in

the

case

of

mixed

complete

graphs,

there

are

3 n(n-1) 2

mixed

graphs for n. In this paper, we show that mixed complete graphs are not periodic for

n  4, as is the case for undirected graphs. See later sections for more detailed terms

and definitions. The following is one of the main results.

Theorem 1.1. Let G be a mixed complete graph equipped with an -function . If n  4, then G is not periodic.

COMBINATORIAL CONDITIONS FOR REGULAR GRAPHS TO BE PERIODIC

To derive the above result, we study combinatorial implications of coefficients of polynomials. If mixed graphs are regular, we can find explicit relations between the characteristic polynomials of -Hermitian adjacency matrices and the ones of the time evolution matrices. On the other hand, coefficients of the characteristic polynomials of -Hermitian adjacency matrices have combinatorial implications. In addition to this, if a mixed graph is periodic, then all the eigenvalues of the time evolution matrix must be algebraic integers. From the above considerations, we can obtain the following combinatorial conditions, which is the second main result of this study.

Theorem 1.2. Let G be a mixed graph equipped with an -function . Assume that G

is k-regular and periodic. Then,

(i)

We

have

2n k



Z;

and

(ii)

If

G

is

an

undirected

graph

with

t

triangles,

then

we

have

16t k3



Z.

The condition in the above theorem leads to an interesting fact when the number of vertices in a regular mixed graph is prime. The following is the third main result.

Theorem 1.3. Let   Q, and let G be a k-regular weekly connected mixed graph with p vertices, where p is a prime number. Then the mixed graph G is periodic if and only if G± is isomorphic to either the cycle graph Cp or the path graph P2.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is mainly preparation. We define several matrices that appear in this paper. In Section 3, we discuss relationships between the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials of the matrices. In Section 4, we discuss conditions on the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials of the time evolution matrices for mixed graphs to be periodic. If mixed graphs are periodic, the eigenvalues of the time evolution matrices must be algebraic integers. We focus on this and study which ring the coefficients belong to. In Section 5, we determine periodicity of mixed complete graphs as an application of the previous sections. The proof itself is straightforward.

2. Preliminaries
A mixed graph G consists of a finite set V (G) of vertices together with a subset A(G)  V (G) × V (G) \ {(x, x) | x  V } of ordered pairs called arcs. Let G be a mixed graph. Define A-1(G) = {a-1 | a  A(G)} and A±(G) = A(G)  A-1(G). If there is no danger of confusion, we write A(G) as A simply. The graph G± = (V (G), A±) is so-called the underlying graph of a mixed graph G, and this is regarded as an undirected graph depending on context. On the other hand, we equate an undirected graph with a mixed graph by considering undirected edges {x, y} as bidirectional arcs (x, y), (y, x). For a vertex x  V (G), define degG x = degG± x. A mixed graph G is k-regular if degG x = k for any vertex x  V (G). Throughout this paper, we assume that mixed graphs are weakly connected, i.e., we assume that G± is connected.

2.1. -Hermitian adjacency matrices. Let G = (V, A) be a mixed graph. For   [0, 2), the -Hermitian adjacency matrix H = H(G)  CV ×V is defined by

 1   ei (H)x,y = e-i   0

if (x, y)  A  A-1, if (x, y)  A \ A-1, if (x, y)  A-1 \ A, otherwise.

When

the

matrix

H 2

is

nothing

but the

Hermitian

adjacency

matrix.

This

is

introduced

by Guo­Mohar

[8]

and

Li­Liu

[25],

independently.

When



=

 3

,

the

matrix

H  is called the Hermitian adjacency matrix of the second kind. This is introduced by

3

Mohar [30]. We refer to [1, 9, 10, 11, 26, 45] as recent studies on Hermitian adjacency

matrices. Note that H(G±) coincides with the ordinary adjacency matrix of G±. We

also refer to gain graphs [7, 28, 32, 34, 36, 41, 43], which are a more generalized version

of mixed graphs.

Define the degree matrix D = D(G)  CV ×V by Dx,y = (degG x)x,y for vertices x, y  V (G). For   [0, 2), the normalized -Hermitian adjacency matrix H~ is

defined by

H~ 

=

D-

.

Note

that

if

a

mixed

graph

G

is

k-regular,

we

have

H~ 

=

1 k

H

.

Let G be a mixed graph. The list of the eigenvalues of H(G) together with their

multiplicities, denoted by Spec(H(G)), is called H-spectrum of G.

2.2. Quantum walks defined by mixed graphs. Let   [0, 2), and let G = (V, A) be a mixed graph. The -function  : A±  R of a mixed graph G is defined by

    (a) = -
0

if a  A \ A-1, if a  A-1 \ A, if a  A  A-1.

Note that (a-1) = -(a) for any a  A±.
In [19], the authors provided a quantum walk defined by a mixed graph. Let G =
(V, A) be a mixed graph equipped with an -function . We define several matrices related to quantum walks. The boundary matrix K = K(G)  CV ×A± is defined by

Kx,a

=

1 deg

x x,t(a).

The coin matrix C = C(G)  CA±×A± is defined by C = 2KK - I. The shift matrix
S = S(G)  CA±×A± is defined by (S)ab = e(b)ia,b-1. Define the time evolution matrix U = U(G)  CA±×A± by U = SC. The entries of U is calculated in [23].

Lemma 2.1 (Lemma 5.1 in [23]). Let G = (V, A) be a mixed graph equipped with an -function . We have

for any a, b  A±.

(U)a,b = e-(a)i

If a mixed graph G is an undirected graph, i.e., G± = G, then (a) = 0 for any a  A. Thus, in this case, the matrix U is the time evolution matrix of the conventional Grover walk on the graph. The matrix U introduced in Section 1 is derived from Lemma 2.1.
The matrices used in our quantum walks are summarized in Table 3, where G = (V, A) is a mixed graph equipped with an -function .

Table 3. The matrices used in our quantum walk

Let U be a time evolution matrix of a mixed graph G equipped with an -function . We say that G is periodic if there exists   N such that U = I. In [23], the authors provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a mixed graph to be periodic.

Lemma 2.2 (Lemma 5.3 in [23]). Let U be a time evolution matrix of a mixed graph G equipped with an -function . Then, we have

{  N | U = I} = {  N |  = 1 for any   Spec(U)}.

(2.1)

In particular, G is periodic if and only if there exists   N such that  = 1 for any eigenvalue  of U.

3. Relationships between coefficients of characteristic polynomials It is well-studied relationships between the eigenvalues of time evolution matrices of quantum and random walks [12, 17, 22, 33, 38]. We cite the result in [17].
Theorem 3.1 (Corollary 3 in [17]). Let U be a time evolution matrix of a mixed graph G equipped with an -function , and let H~ = H~(G). Then, we have
det(I2m - U) = (2 - 1)m-n det((2 + 1)In - 2H~), where n is the number of vertices of G±, and m is the number of edges of G±.

6

S. KUBOTA

In the above equality, we call det((2 + 1)In - 2H~) the inherited factor of U and (2 - 1)m-n the birth factor of U. Since the roots of the birth factor of U
are ±1, the inherited factor determines whether the graph is periodic or not. Let g(x) = det(xI - H~). Then the inherited factor can be written as

det((2 + 1)In - 2H~) = det

where n is the number of vertices of G. From now on, these notations will be used unless otherwise noted. Note that cn-1 = dn-1 = 0 since Tr H(G) = Tr H~(G) = 0.
First, we explore relationships between coefficients of f, g, and .

(i) 2n = 1; (ii) 2n-1 = 0; (iii) 2n-2 = n + 4dn-2; and (iv) 2n-3 = 8dn-3.
In particular, the inherited factor (x) of U is a monic polynomial.

Proof. First, we claim that

 {(n, n)}   {(n - 1, n - 1)} Ij = {(n, n - 1), (n - 2, n - 2)}   {(n - 1, n - 2), (n - 3, n - 3)}

We add the line L : l =

(p - 2, q - 1)  I2n-3. Thus we have I2n-3 = {(n - 1, n - 2), (n - 3, n - 3)}. By

The coefficients of H have combinatorial implications. See Corollary 3.1 in [32] and

4. Rings to which coefficients belong

In this section, we investigate which ring the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials belong to. In particular, we focus on the coefficients of the inherited factor of U for periodic graphs.
Let   C. Recall that Z[] = {p() | p(x)  Z[x]}, and Q() is the smallest subfield of C containing Q and . Explicitly, it is described as

Q() =

p() q()

p(x), q(x)  Q[x], q() = 0

.

We use the same notation as in Section 3.

Lemma 4.1. We have g(x)  Q(ei)[x].

Proof. We have (D-1H(G))x,y  Q(ei) for any x, y  V . Thus, g(x) = det(xI - H~(G)) = det(xI - D-1H(G))  Q(ei)[x].

Let   C. We say that  is an algebraic integer if there exists a monic polynomial

p(x)  Z[x] such that p() = 0. Let  denote the set of algebraic integers. We recall

some

basic

facts

on

the

algebraic

integers.

Let

m

=

e

2 m

i

.

Proposition 4.2 ([15, 24]). We have the following.
(i)  is a subring of C; (ii)   Q = Z; and (iii)   Q(m) = Z[m].

Proposition 4.3. If G is periodic, then the following hold.
(i) (x)  [x]; (ii) If   Q, there exists a positive integer m such that (x)  (Z[m])[x]; and (iii) If   {0, /2}, then (x)  Z[x].

Proof. (i) By Lemma 2.2, there exists   N such that  = 1 for any eigenvalue  of U. Any eigenvalue  of U is a root of the monic polynomial p(x) = x - 1  Z[x], so   . Let 1, 2, . . . , 2n be roots of (x). Since (x) is monic and  is a ring,

(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2) · · · (x - 2n)  [x].

(ii)

Let



=

2l m

,

where

l

and

m

are

coprime.

From Lemma 4.1, we have g(x) 

Q(m)[x]. Lemma 3.2 implies (x)  Q(m)[x]. From (i) and Proposition 4.2 (iii), we

have (x)  (  Q(m))[x] = (Z[m])[x].

(iii) If  = 0, then clearly g(x)  Q[x]. If  = /2, then it also holds that g(x)  Q[x].

Indeed, the eigenvalues of H~  are real numbers, so g(x)  R[x]. By Lemma 4.1, we

have

g(x)



Q(e

 2

i

)[x]

=

2
Q(i)[x].

Therefore, g(x)  (R  Q(i))[x] = Q[x].

Now, let

  {0, /2}. Lemma 3.2 implies (x)  Q[x]. From (i), we have (x)  (  Q)[x] =

Z[x].

The claim in Proposition 4.3 (iii) for  = 0 is already known via cyclotomic polynomials [13]. We here derived a more general statement in a different way that does not use cyclotomic polynomials. Focusing on a specific coefficient, we obtain a very simple necessary criterion for mixed graphs to be periodic, which is one of the main results.

Corollary 4.4. Let G be a mixed graph equipped with an -function . If G is k-regular

and

periodic,

then

we

4.1. Undirected graphs. We give a more developed consideration to undirected graphs. Note that if  is an undirected graph, then H() is the ordinary adjacency matrix for any . In addition, for an arbitrary -function , we have U() = U0(), where 0 is the 0-function. We continue to use the same notation as in Section 3.

Lemma 4.5. Let  be an undirected graph, and let t be the number of triangles in . Then we have cn-3 = -2t.

Proof. Let A be the adjacency matrix of . Let 1, 2, . . . , n be the eigenvalues of A. Remark that

4.2. Periodic graphs with a prime number of vertices. The condition in Corollary 4.4 leads to an interesting fact when the number of vertices in a regular graph is prime.

Theorem 4.7. Let   Q, and let G be a k-regular weekly connected mixed graph with p vertices, where p is a prime number. Then the mixed graph G is periodic if and only if G± is isomorphic to either the cycle graph Cp or the path graph P2.

Proof.

Suppose

periodic.

We

have

Z

by

Corollary

4.4.

Since

p

is

prime

and

k < p, we have k = 1, 2. The mixed graph G is weekly connected, so G± is isomorphic

to either Cp or P2. Conversely, mixed graphs whose underlying graphs are isomorphic

to the cycle graphs or the path graphs are periodic since   Q. This is already shown

in [23].

4.3. Examples. In previous works, several periodic regular undirected graphs in the

sense of conventional Grover walks have been found. We list the number of vertices,

valency, and the number of triangles in those graphs. See Table 4. We can see that the

5. Periodicity of mixed complete graphs

We say that a mixed graph G is a mixed complete graph if G± is isomorphic to the

complete graph. In this section, we discuss periodicity of mixed complete graphs. In the

case of undirected graphs, there is only one complete graph for n. On the other hand,

there

are

3 n(n-1) 2

mixed

graphs

for

n

in

the

case

of mixed

complete

graphs.

Moreover,

there are infinitely many ways to take . However, the mixed complete graphs are not

periodic for any n  4 and . We prove this fact by the previous arguments.

Theorem 5.1. Let G be a mixed complete graph equipped with an -function . If n  4, then G is not periodic.

Proof. Assume that G is periodic.

Since G is (n - 1)-regular, we have

2n n-1

 Z by

Corollary

4.4.

However,

2n n-1

is

not

integer

for

n  4.

We

have

a

contradiction.

We supplement the case of n = 2, 3. When n = 2, a mixed K2 is a mixed path. In [23], the authors show that the mixed paths are periodic for any . When n = 3, a mixed K3 is a mixed cycle. The authors in [23] show that a mixed cycle is periodic if and only if   Q.
