SCATTERING AND NON-SCATTERING OF THE HARTREE-TYPE NONLINEAR DIRAC SYSTEM AT CRITICAL REGULARITY
YONGGEUN CHO, SEOKCHANG HONG, AND KIYEON LEE

Abstract. We consider Cauchy problem of the Hartree-type nonlinear Dirac equation with

potentials given by Vb(x) =

1 4

e-b|x| |x|

(b



0).

In previous works, a standard argument is to

utilise null form estimates in order to prove global well-posedness for Hs-data, s > 0. However,

the null structure inside the equations is not enough to attain the critical regularity. We impose

an extra regularity assumption with respect to the angular variable. Firstly, we prove global well-

posedness and scattering of Dirac equations with Hartree-type nonlinearity for b > 0 for small

L2x-data with additional angular regularity. We also show that only small amount of angular regularity is required to obtain global existence of solutions. Secondly, we obtain non-scattering

result for a certain class of solutions with the Coulomb potential b = 0.

1. Introduction

We are concerned with global well-posedness and scattering of the (1 + 3)-dimensional Dirac equa-

tion with Hartree-type nonlinearity for Yukawa and Coulomb potentials. The main equation is

given by (1.1)

 -iµµ + m = (Vb  (0)),



(0, ·) := 0  L2x(R3).

The potential Vb is the spatial function

(1.2)

Vb(x)

=

1 4

e-b|x| |x|

(b  0),

which is called Yukawa (Coulomb) potential if b > 0 (b = 0).

We start with the basic notation. Throughout this paper, we denote points by (xµ), µ = 0, 1, 2, 3

in the Minkowski space (R1+3, m), where m is the metric given by m = diag(-1, +1, +1, +1). The

partial derivatives with respect to xµ is written by µ. We shall use the notation t = x0 for time variable, and x = (x1, x2, x3) for spatial variable. Then we write 0 = t and  = (1, 2, 3). The unknown spinor field  is written as a column vector in C4 and m > 0 is a mass constant. We

also denote the complex conjugate of the transpose t by . We use Roman indices j, k = 1, 2, 3

and Greek indices µ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3 and adopt the Einstein summation notation, i.e., any repeated

indices mean the summation over described range. Thus we write µµ = 0t +

3 j=1

j j ,

µ, µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 are the Dirac gamma matrices given by

(1.3) with Pauli matrices:

0 = I2×2 0

, j = 0 j

0 -I2×2

(1.4)

1 = 0 1 , 2 = 0 -i , 3 = 1 0 .

0 -1

One may observe that the equation (1.1) can be derived by uncoupling the Dirac-Klein-Gordon system

(1.5)

(-iµµ + m) = , (t2 -  + M 2) = .

In fact, we let a scalar field  be a standing wave, i.e., (t, x) = eitf (x) with M  ||. Then the Klein-Gordon part of (1.5) becomes

(1.6)

(- + M 2 - 2) = .

Then one easily shows that the solutions of (1.6) are given by

(1.7)

 = Vb  ()

 with b = M 2 - 2. We put (1.7) into the Dirac part of (1.5) and then a spinor field  gives

the desired equation. (See also [25, 27].) One may also replace a quadratic term  by ||2.

Indeed, the equation (1.11) with V0(x) = |x|-1 was derived by the authors of [6], by uncoupling

the Maxwell-Dirac system under the assumption of vanishing magnetic field with the quadratic

term ||2.

The L2x-norm of the solutions to the system (1.1) is conserved:

(1.8)

|(t, x)|2 dx = |0(x)|2 dx.

When m = b = 0, the equation (1.11) is invariant under the scaling:

(t,

x)



(t,

x)

=

3 2

(t,

x),

for fixed  > 0. Thus the system (1.11) is essentially L2-critical. In this paper we exclusively consider the massive case (m > 0) and by scaling, we set m = 1 hereafter.

We introduce the notation µ and  as follows:

(1.9)

j = 0j,  = 0.

To study the initial value problem of Dirac equations, we shall follow the standard approach as in

[3, 24, 27]. We define the Dirac projection operators ± as a Fourier multiplier with the symbol

(1.10)

±()

1 2

where

A

gives the

following properties:

±±

=

±

=

0. Throughout this paper, we will use the notation ± := ±. Then we can decompose

HARTREE-TYPE NONLINEAR DIRAC EQUATION

 = + + -. Finally, using notation (1.9) and projection (1.10), our system (1.1) is rewritten as

(1.11)

(-it ±  )± = ±[(Vb  ())], ±(0) := 0,±.

We say that the solution  scatters to a free solution in a Hilbert space H if there exist ± := eit  ± (±  H) such that

±(t) - ± (t) H  0 as t  ±,

or equivalently,

(t) - (t) H  0 as t  ±,

where  = + + - .

Recently, the Cauchy problem of Dirac equations has been extensively studied. For instance, see [1] for result on the cubic-nonlinear Dirac equations and reference therein. Dirac equations coupled with several fields have been also well-studied. For example, we refer the readers to [12, 26, 3, 4] for the study on the Maxwell-Dirac and Dirac-Klein-Gordon systems.

We shall mention a few selected results on some related equations. Firstly, we present the boson star equation (or semi-relativistic equation) with Hartree-type nonlinearity:

(1.12)

(-it +  )u = Vb  |u|2 u.

In the works of Lenzmann and Cho-Ozawa [17, 9] the well-posedness for b  0 was proved in

H s -data,

s

>

1 2

- ,

and

it

was

improved

later

to

s

>

1 4

by

Herr-Lenzmann

[14]

when

b

=

0.

The

linear scattering does not occur when b = 0 [9]. Instead, a modified scattering of (1.12) can occur

in case when b = 0. For this see [20]. On the other hand, the linear scattering problem was handled

in [15] for b > 0 and s > 0.

Scattering for Yukawa potential. Now we pay attention to the equation (1.11) with the Yukawa potential. The Cauchy problem of the system (1.11) was studied by A. Tesfahun [24, 25] and C. Yang [27] independently. The authors of [25, 27] utilise the null structure and bilinear estimates to prove global well-posedness and scattering for Hs-data, s > 0. However, the global well-posedness is still open at the critical regularity.

In this paper we establish global well-posedness and scattering of solutions to the system (1.11) for

small data in the scaling critical Sobolev space which has extra weighted regularity in the angular

variables. To be more precise, we let ij = xij - xj i be the infinitesimal generators of the

rotations on R3 and let S2 = 1i<j3 2ij be the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the unit sphere

S2  R3.

Then we can define the fractional power of angular derivative by





=

(1

-

S2

)

 2

,

which will be treated concretely below, and define angularly regular space L2x, space by  -L2x

and its norm by f L2x, :=  f Xx2 . Now we state the main theorem:

Theorem 1.1. Let  > 0. Then there exists  > 0 such that for initial data 0 L2x,(R3)  , the Cauchy problem (1.11) is globally well-posed and solutions  scatter in L2x, to free solutions as
t  ±.

The main improvement of Theorem 1.1 is to attain the critical regularity. Motivated by the work of [26, 3], we exploit an additional angular regularity. Furthermore, we observe that only a small amount of regularity in the angular variables is required to prove global well-posedness.

Strategy of proof of Theorem 1.1. We discuss the key ideas of the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Because of huge amount of notations to be used in the rest of this paper, we would like to elucidate

the main scheme and motivation here for convenience to the readers. The main approach is to

construct the Picard's iterate, which is convergent in the adapted function spaces. Thus the crucial

part of the proof is the following multilinear estimates: (See also Proposition 3.1.)

t
ei(t-t)  [Vb  ()](t) dt

0

F±

   . F±1

F±2

F±3

Here F± is the adapted function space which will be defined in Section 3. Roughly speaking, the space F± consists of V±2 space equipped with angular regularity and hence by making use of duality

(Lemma 2.3) we will study quartilinear estimates.

We deal with all possible frequency interactions such as High×High and Low×High interactions with low-modulation and high-modulation regimes. Since we have four-input frequencies, it seems to require repetitive work. Fortunately, by Ho¨lder's inequality and symmetry between two spinor fields, the problem of the quartilinear estimates can be reduced to frequency-localised bilinear expressions such as
P0 [(P1 )(P2 )] , L2t L2x except for the case that high-modulation is bigger than the highest-input-frequency. See also Proposition 4.1. When the modulation is bigger than the highest frequency, the situation is rather easier than other cases. Indeed, we simply use boundedness in high modulation regime (2.5) and L2-bilinear estimates shown in [27].

High frequency - Low modulation. We consider the case that the modulation d is less than the

lowest-input-frequency. There is nothing new ingredients to obtain the required bilinear estimates.

Indeed, the space-time Strichartz estimates and the null structure between two input-spinor fields

will play a crucial role in the low-modulation regime. However, the localised L4-Strichartz estimate

(see [10] for instance) gives

eit  Pf L4t L4x

1 2

Pf

L2x ,

which would be too big and troublesome in the summation. To avoid this problem, we apply the

almost orthogonal decomposition by cubes with smaller size µ   . Then we have the improved

estimates such as

eit  Pq Pf L4t L4x

(µ)

1 4

Pq P f

L2x ,

where Pq is the cube localisation operator. Even though we gain factor

µ 

1
4 , it pays for more work,

i.e., we need to take square-summation by cubes to recover the Pf L2x term. This step would

cause some loss in a certain estimate. Here Lemma 2.7 assures that such loss can be absorbed

elsewhere.

We would like to mention that the most delicate interaction is the High×High frequency interaction. This is why the low regularity problem becomes more difficult as the spatial dimension decreases,

HARTREE-TYPE NONLINEAR DIRAC EQUATION

5

i.e., the High×High interactions in the nonlinearity grows seriously. Thus such interactions would be the main obstacle in the improvement of the previous results [25, 27]. At this point, we remark that the (infinitesimal) rotation generators ij = xij - xj i relax such delicate interactions. Furthermore, since the optimality of available range of the Strichartz estimates is given by the Knapp-type counterexample, which is non-radial, it is natural to expect the improvement of the Strichartz estimates by imposing radial assumption. In fact, such improvement is given by the work of J. Sterbenz [23] and Y. Cho - S. Lee [8]. Hence one can use wider range of admissible Strichartz pairs. For instance, one may use

eit  P1f L2t L4x+

  P1f L2x

for

arbitrarily small

>0

and



close

to

1 2

.

Nevertheless,

we are

not

only

aiming to

improve the

Sobolev index by the previous works but also interested in the low regularity problem with respect

to the angular variables, namely, 0 <   1. For this purpose, we exploit the almost orthogonal

decomposition by angular sectors together with cubes and then apply angular concentration es-

timates Lemma 2.9. In this process, one may observe that the Low×High frequency interactions

become more difficult than the High×High interaction, especially when the low frequency controls

the angular frequency. Consequently we get a slightly bigger bound in this interactions. Fortu-

nately, the Yukawa potential plays a distinguished role. Indeed, the potential is nothing but the Fourier multiplier with symbol (b2 + ||2)-1 and hence it is no harm to the summation.

In this manner we can prove Proposition 4.1 in the low-modulation regime. For high-modulation, we divide it into two cases.

High modulation - Low frequency. As we have mentioned earlier, the situation when the modulation is larger than the highest-input frqeuncy is rather easier. We only consider when the modulation ranges from the lowest frequency to the highest frequency. As low-modulation regime, we deal with the High×High and Low×High frequency interactions. In the High×High region, we can still use the null structure. However, we do not exploit the angular sector decomposition and hence angular regularity. Instead, one major observation is to decompose the modulation. In fact, we have the following decomposition:

CdP0 (C±d1 P1 )(C±d2 P2 ) L2t L2x

CdP0 (C±d1 P1 )(C ±2dP2 ) L2t L2x + CdP0 (C ±1dP1 )(C±d2 P2 ) . L2t L2x

Here Cd± is the modulation localisation operator. This can be easily derived by the support

condition. The advantage of this observation is to allow the use of bound of high-modulation regime

(2.5),

which

yields

d-

1 2

and

this

is

truly

helpful,

since

we

are

concerned with

d

min{0, 1, 2}.

We will exploit the orthogonal decomposition by cubes as low-modulation case, and apply L4-

Strichartz estimates together with the bound (2.5) to obtain the desired estimates. Even though we do not use the null structure in the Low×High interaction, we can follow the aforementioned process and get the required bound.

Non-scattering for Coulomb potential. We show a non-existence of scattering in L2x for (1.1)

with

the

potential

=

1 4|x|

.

In view of [5, 19, 7], there are trivial scattering

6

conditions of (1.1). However, as observed in [7] for 2D problem, such scattering cannot occur for a certain class of solutions. To be precise, let us define I as follows:

I(, )(t) :=

V0  () (t, x)  (t, x) dx.

R3

Now we present our second theorem concerning non-scattering.

Theorem 1.2. Assume that  be a smooth solution to (1.1) with b = 0 which scatters in L2x to a smooth solution   . If there exist 0 < c < 1 and t > 0 such that   satisfies

(1.13)

I(  ,   )(t)  cI(  ,   )(t)

for t > t, then ,   = 0 in L2x.

If  scatters in L2x to   satisfying (1.13), then by Lemmas 6.2 and 6.3 below one can find 0 < c < 0 and t > 0 such that
I(, )(t)  cI(, )(t)

for any t > t.

It is essential to handle the lower bound of functional H(t) = Im (t),   (t) L2x by We will show

d dt

H (t)

 c|I(  ,   )(t)| + o(t-1).

  (0) L2x .

Due to the matrix  the value of I(  ,   ) may vanish. To avoid this we assume (1.13) and hence

obtain

for

Therefore, if

  (0) L2x > 0,

then the lower bound eventually will lead us to contradiction to the uniform boundedness of H(t).

Organisation. This paper is organized as follows. We introduce notations and preliminary setup in Section 2, which consists of Fourier localisation operators, basic analysis on the unit sphere, properties of U p - V p spaces, and linear estimates related to the wave-type Strichartz estimates. In Section 3, we discuss the proof of Theorem 1.1 and reduction to multilinear estimates. In Section 4, we present frequency-localised multilinear estimates (Proposition 4.1), which play a crucial role in the proof of Theorem 1.1. Then Section 5 is devoted to the proof of Proposition 4.1. Finally, we give the proof of non-scattering result in Section 6.

Notation. As usual different positive constants, which are independent of dyadic numbers µ, ,

and d are denoted by the same letter C, if not specified. The inequalities A B and A B means

that A  CB and A  C-1B, respectively for some C > 0. By the notation A  B we mean that

We also write Fx(f ) = f and Ft,x(u) = u. We denote the backward and forward wave propagation of a functiom f on R3 by

Finally, we shall use usual inner products for the normed space C4 and L2x(R3). Namely, we write

2.1. Multipliers. We fix a smooth function   C0(R) such that  is supported in the set

{

and

we

let

 t = 1, 
2Z

and write 1 =

(

)

with

1(0)

We

define

Qµ

to

be

a

covering

R3,

and

let

{q }qQµ

be

a

P = 

| - i| 

,

P1 = 1(| - i|),

Pq = q(-i),

Cd± = 

| - it ±  | d

.

We also define C±d = d C± and C±d is defined in the similar way. For simplicity we also write

Cd+ = Cd. Given 0 <  1, we define C to be a collection of finitely overlapping caps of radius 

on the sphere S2. If   C, we let  be the centre of the cap . Then we define {}C to be a

smooth

partition

of

unity

subordinate

to

the

{

}

and

denote

the

angular

Fourier localisation multipliers by R = (-i).

2.2. Analysis on the sphere. We introduce some basic facts from harmonic analysis on the unit sphere. The most of ingredients can be found in [3, 22]. We also refer the readers to [21] for more systematic introduction to the spherical harmonics. We let Y be the set of homogeneous harmonic polynomial of degree . Then define {y,n}2n=0 a set of orthonormal basis for Y, with respect to the inner product:

(2.1)

y,n, y,n L2 (S2) =

y,n()y,n () d.
S2

Given f  L2x(R3), we have the orthogonal decomposition as follow:

(2.2)

f (x) =

f (|x|), y,n() L2(S2)y,n

x |x| .

Lemma 2.1 (Lemma 7.1. of [3]). Let N  1. Then HN is uniformly bounded on Lp(R3) in N , and HN commutes with all radial Fourier multipliers. Moreover, if N   1, then either N  N  or

HN ±HN = 0.

By Lemma 2.1, we see that HN commutes with the P and Cd± multipliers since we can write

Cd±

=

eit



(-

it d

)e±it



.

On the other hand, we note that HN

does not commute with the

cube and cap localisation operators R and Pq, which are non-radial.

2.3. Adapted function spaces. Let 1  p  + and I = {tk}Kk=0 : tk  R, tk < tk+1 be the set of increasing sequences of real numbers. We define the p-variation of v to be

1

K

p

|v|V p = sup
{tk }K k=0 I

v(tk) - v(tk-1)

p L2x

k=0

Then the Banach space V p can be defined to be all right continuous functions v : R  L2x such that the quantity

v V p = v L t L2x + |v|V p
is finite. Set u V±p = eit  u V p . We recall basic properties of V±2 space from [3, 4]. For more about U p - V p space see [13].

The following lemma is on a simple bound in the high-modulation region.

Lemma 2.2 (Corollary 2.18. of [13]). Let 2  q  . For d  2Z, we have

Now we present an energy inequality. See also [13, Proposition 2.10].

(2.8)

C±du V±2

u V±2 .

To prove the scattering result, we shall use the following lemma:

Lemma 2.4 (Lemma 7.4. of [3]). Let u  V±2. Then there exists f  L2x such that u(t) - eit  f L2x  0 as t  ±.

2.4. Auxiliary estimates. In this section we provide the key ingredients to the proof of Theorem 1.1. We introduce the null-form-bound, localised Strichartz estimates, and various squaresummation. We would like to highlight that there is nothing new, and hence we simply list several estimates used in the sequel without proof. However, we also encourage readers to read the reference [2, 3, 22, 23].

It is well-known fact that the nonlinearity in the system (1.11) has null structure, which gives the

cancellation property. To reveal null form, we write

(2.9)

(±1 )±2  =[(±1 - ±1 (x))]±2  + (±1 )(±2 - ±2 (y)) + ±1 (x)±2 (y),

for any x, y  R3. Then we have the following null-form-type bound:

(2.10)

|±1 ()±2 ()|

(±1,

±2)

+

|

|| 

±2 

||| .

To exploit the null form for the first and second terms of (2.9), we use the following lemma:

Lemma 2.5 (Lemma 8.1. of [3]). Let 1 < r < . If   1,  -1,   C, then (± - ±(()))RPf Lrx  RPf Lrx .
We recall Strichartz estimates for wave equation, which plays a significant role in the proof of Theorem 1.1. Note that an additional angular regularity allows to extend admissible Strichartz pairs.

For the first estimate, see Lemma 3.2. of [27], or Lemma 3.1, of [2]. The second estimate can be found in Theorem 1. of [8]. Note that the use of decomposition by smaller cubes q  Qµ gives us better estimates. However, we need to recover the term Pf L2x by square-summation with respect to cubes q  Qµ and this would result in a certain loss in estimates. Fortunately, the following lemma allows this loss to be absorbed elsewhere.

Lemma 2.7 (Lemma 8.6. of [3]). Let {Pj}jJ and {Mj}jJ be a collection of spatial Fourier multipliers. Suppose that the symbols of Pj have finite overlap, and

Mj Pj f L2x  Pj f L2x

for some  > 0. Let q > 2, r  2. Suppose that there exists A > 0 such that for every j we have

the bound

eit  Pj f Lqt Lrx  A Pj f L2x .

Then for every  > 0, we have

So far we have seen that the additional angular regularity gives rise to the improvement of spacetime Strichartz estimates. However, we are interested in only small amount of angular regularity, namely,   1. To achieve this low-regularity-condition, we exploit the following so-called angular concentration estimates:

fixed-point argument. That is, by the use of Lemma 2.3, we consider the following quartilinear
form: ()() dtdx.

After using the Ho¨lder inequality, we need to deal with bilinear estimates, which has essentially trilinear expression via L2-duality:

Suppose that , ,  have small modulation. We also assume that the Fourier transform of  is

supported in {| +  |  d}, the support of  is contained in the set {| ±1  |  d}, and  is supported in the set {| ±2  |  d} for some d  2Z. Then the integral (2.13) vanishes unless

|  -  1  ±2  | d.

Now we define the modulation function:

M±1,±2 (, ) = |  -  1  ±2  |.
We first note the symmetry properties of M±1,±2, for example, we have M+,+(, ) = M-,-(, ), and M±,(, ) = M±,(, ).

In this section we prove Theorem 1.1 via standard fixed-point argument. To be precise, we shall find the solution to (1.1) in a complete metric space (F (), d) defined as

Here we put j := ±j . Then we need to show that Y is a contraction mapping on F (). Indeed the linear part of (3.1) can be handled as follows:

Hence Y : F ()  F () is a contraction mapping for sufficiently small , which completes the

proof of global well-posedness of (1.1).

Now we move onto the scattering property of (1.1). We have the solutions ±  F±, and hence  ±  V±2. By Lemma 2.4, there exists function ±  L2x, :=  -L2x such that
± - eit   L2x,  0,
as t  ±, which completes the proof of scattering of (1.1). Finally, we are left to show the multilinear estimates Proposition 3.1.

4. Proof of Proposition 3.1

In the remainder of this paper, we focus on the proof of multilinear estimates Proposition 3.1. First, after an application of Lemma 2.3, we write

HARTREE-TYPE NONLINEAR DIRAC EQUATION

where we put ,N = ±PHN . From now on, we turn our attention to the following quardrilinear form:

(4.1)

I,N :=

V
R1+3

 (1,N1 2,N2 )(4,N4 3,N3 ) dtdx

.

We first note that if j are the spatial Fourier frequencies for the functions in the integrand, by Plancherel's theorem the integral (4.1) vanishes unless

-1 + 2 + 3 - 4 = 0.

If 0 is the output frequency of the bilinear form , then we have

0 = -1 + 2 = 4 - 3.

Thus, if the output frequency 0 is localised in an annulus of dyadic radius 0, the standard Littlewood-Paley trichotomy must give the following frequency interactions:

(4.2)

min{0, 1, 2} min{0, 3, 4}

med{0, 1, 2}  max{0, 1, 2}, med{0, 3, 4}  max{0, 3, 4}.

In view of Lemma 2.1, we also have the similar relation for the angular frequencies Nj, j = 0, 1, · · · , 4:

(4.3)

min{N0, N1, N2} min{N0, N3, N4}

med{N0, N1, N2}  max{N0, N1, N2}, med{N0, N3, N4}  max{N0, N3, N4}.

We also consider the relation between spatial frequency j and modulation d (distance to the cone). For this purpose we are concerned with three cases as follows:

(4.4) (4.5) (4.6)

d min, min  d  max,
max d.

The third case (4.6) is rather easier than other cases. Indeed, it suffices to consider one of spinor
fields has higher modulation max. We may assume that 1,N1 has the highest modulation and write 1,N1 = C±d1 1,N1 . Then we consider the following quartilinear expression.

Then usual square summation with respect to j and Nj gives the required estimate as Proposition 3.1.

Consequently, we are left to consider the cases (4.4), (4.5). We use Ho¨lder's inequality for I,N to obtain

lowest terms of 1, 2, 3, 4 and Nmin, Nm in are defined in the similar way. Note that the factor

plays a role as kernel in the square summation with respect to the j .

By Young's

the details. See also Remark 1 of [25].

5. Bilinear estimates: Proof of Proposition 4.1
In this section, we prove various frequency-localised bilinear estimates, which implies Proposition 4.1 when the modulation is bounded above by the highest frequency.
5.1. High frequency - Low modulation. First, we are concerned with low-modulation regime. The following bilinear estimates imply Proposition 4.1 when the modulation is less than the lowest frequency.

Theorem 5.1. Let  > 0. For arbitrarily small  > 0, we have

First we decompose the modulation as follows:

P0 HN0 (1,N1 2,N2 ) =

CdP0 HN0 (C±d1 1,N1 )(C±d2 2,N2 )

d2Z

+ C<dP0 HN0 (Cd±1 1,N1 )(C<±d2 2,N2 )

+ C<dP0 HN0 (C<±d1 1,N1 )(Cd±2 2,N2 )

=: A0 + A1 + A2.
d2Z

We consider the case 0  1  2 with d 0. By Lemma 2.10, we must have ±1 = ±2. We also note that the range of the modulation d is restricted to the region -0 1 d 0. We begin with the A0 term. We use the almost orthogonal decomposition by angular sectors and cubes as
follows:

A0 L2t,x

, C |-| 

q,q Q0 |q-q| 0

CdP0 HN0 (C±d1 RPq 1,N1 )(C±d2 R Pq 2,N2 )

,
L2t,x

1

where  =

d0 1 2

2 . As we have seen (2.9), to exploit the null structure, we write

C±d1 RPq1,N1




C±d2 R Pq 2,N2

= C±d1 ±1 - ±1 (1) RPq 1,N1  (C±d2 R Pq 2,N2 )

+ (C±d1 RPq 1,N1 ) C±d2 ±2 - ±2 (2 ) R Pq 2,N2 + (C±d1 RPq 1,N1 )±1 (1)±2 (2 )(C±d2 R Pq 2,N2 ).

16

Y. CHO, S. HONG, AND K. LEE

Thus by Lemma 2.5, (2.10) and Ho¨lder's inequality, we gain the angle  and then apply in order angular concentration estimates Lemma 2.9 on the lowest angular frequency term and squaresummation-version of L4-Strichartz estimates (2.11).

We put  > . (Since  > 0 by Lemma 2.7 can be chosen arbitrarily small,  >  obviously implies  > 0.) Note that A1 and A2 can be treated in the identical manner. The summation with respect to d 0 gives (5.1).

On the other hand, in order to get (5.2) we use L2-duality. Since ±1 = ±2, 0 1  2, and 0 = -1 + 2, Lemma 2.10 leads us that

Then as previous argument, we exploit null structure, Ho¨lder's inequality and use angular concentration estimates on the 0,N0 term and L4-Strichartz estimates to obtain

As (5.1), the identical argument is applied to treat A1, A2 and hence the summation with respect to the d 0 gives (5.2).

In the Low×High interaction, by symmetry, it suffices to deal with 1  2  0 with d 1. As the previous estimate, we have -1 1 d 1. In the Low×High interaction regime, the output frequency 0 is high, i.e., 0  max. To exploit the almost orthogonality by smaller cubes, we make use of L2-duality as follows:

A0 = L2t,x

I2 := CdPq R0 0,N0 (C±d1 R1 1,N1 )(C±d2 Pq R2 2,N2 ) dtdx.

Now the remainder step is very similar as the proof of (5.2). Indeed, we apply in order Ho¨lder's inequality and Lemma 2.9 and then square-sum estimates (2.11).

Again, we put  > . As the High×High regime, the estimate of the A1 and A2 terms is followed in the similar way. Moreover, the summation on d 1 gives (5.3). This completes the proof of Proposition 4.1 in low-modulation regime.

5.2. High modulation - Low frequency I. The aim of this section is to prove Proposition 4.1 in the regime: min  d  max. It suffices to show the following bilinear estimates:

Theorem 5.2. For any  > 0, we have

We start with the High×High interaction. For 0  d  1, since M±1,±2 d  1, we have

±1 = ±2 and M±1,±2

0.

Thus

the

angle between

the

and



is

less than

(

.

We first consider the A0 term. We decompose it into the following:

(5.6)

A0 L2t,x

CdP0 HN0 (C±d1 1,N1 )(C ±2d2,N2 ) L2t,x + CdP0 HN0 (C ±1d1,N1 )(C±d2 2,N2 ) L2t,x

=: A0,1 + A0,2.

We use the L2-duality and null-form-type bound to gain

0 1

2.

Then the almost orthogonal

decomposition by smaller cubes, Ho¨lder's inequality, Bernstein's inequality for 0,N0, using (2.5)

18

Y. CHO, S. HONG, AND K. LEE

for 1,N1 and L4-Strichartz estimates (2.11) for 2,N2 give us the desired estimates as follows.

The A0,2 tern can be also treated similarly. Now we turn our attention to the A1 term. As (5.6) we get the following decomposition:

(5.7)

A1 L2t,x

CdP0 HN0 (Cd±1 1,N1 )(C ±2d2,N2 ) L2t,x + CdP0 HN0 (Cd±1 1,N1 )(C±d2 2,N2 ) L2t,x

=: A1,1 + A1,2.

The term A1,1 is treated in the identical manner as the A0 term. The estimate of A1,2 is very

1

straightforward. Indeed, we use the null structure to obtain the factor

0 1

2 and the L2-duality.

Then simply using Ho¨lder's inequality, Bernstein's inequality for 0,N0 and the boundedness in

the high-modulation region (2.5) for 1,N1 , 2,N2 give

Since we have two high-input frequencies, the estimate of A2 is exactly same as the A1 term. We omit the details. Finally, combining the bound of Aj, j = 0, 1, 2 and summation by min  d  max gives (5.4).
Now we are concerned with the Low×High interaction. By symmetry, it is enough to consider 1  0  2 with 1  d  0. The following argument is very similar as the High×High interaction. In fact, we use the decomposition as (5.6) and (5.7). For the Low×High regime, we do not use null structure. Instead, we apply the orthogonal decomposition by cubes q, q  Q1

Now we consider A1. We use the decomposition (5.7). Then the A1,1 can be treated in the similar way as A0,1. The estimate of A1,2 also follows the routine of the A0,1 term. In fact, after the L2-duality we apply the orthogonal decomposition by cubes and Bernstein's inequality and then (2.5) as follows.

The A2 term can be treated similarly. In fact, we can decompose it into A2 = A2,1 + A2,2 as (5.6) and (5.7). Then one can deal with A2,1 as A0,2 and A2,2 as A1,2, respectively. This completes the proof of Proposition 4.1 in the case: min  d  max.

6. Non-scattering: Proof of Theorem 1.2
For the proof of Theorem 1.2 we have only to consider the scattering as t  +. We proceed by contradiction, assuming that
  (0) L2x > 0.

Let us define functional H(t) by

H(t) = Im ,   L2x .

It is clear that H(t) is uniformly bounded from the mass conservation (1.8). Now by taking the time derivative (this can be done by a standard approximation with smooth functions) and using the self-adjointness of Dirac operator we have

d dt

H (t)

=

1 4

Re

| · |-1  ( ,  C4 ,  

L2x .

Integrating over [t, t], we get

t
H(t) - H(t) = Y (t) dt,
t

where

Y

(t)

=

1 4

Re

| · |-1 

, 

C4 ,  

L2x .

We will show that

(6.1)

|Y (t)| t-1

for sufficiently large t when   L2x > 0. Once (6.1) has been shown, due to the fixed sign of Y for large time, (6.1) would lead us to a contradiction to the fact that H(t) is uniformly bounded
on time and hence complete the proof of Theorem 1.2.

From now on we focus on the proof of (6.1). To do so we reconstitute Y as follows:

Y := Y1 + Y2 + Y3,

Y1

This together with (6.2) leads us to

Now let us turn to Y2, Y3. To treat them we need a time decay estimate for the linear solutions and L x estimates for the potential term.

Lemma 6.2. For any C-valued functions u  L2x  L x we have

This lemma can be readily shown by a standard optimization. If u1 = u2, then we need a regularity and a space-decay assumption.

Lemma 6.3 (Lemma 3.2 of [9]). Let C-valued functions u1  L2x and u2  L6x. Then for any 0 <  < 1, we get

for j = 2, 3. Then (6.5) and (6.6) conclude (6.1).
