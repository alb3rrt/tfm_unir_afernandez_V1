## Abstract

Under holographic prescription for Schwinger-Keldysh closed time contour for non-equilibrium system, we consider fluctuation effect of the order parameter in a holographic superconductor model. Near the critical point, we derive the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau effective action governing dynamics of the fluctuating order parameter. In a semi-analytical approach, the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau action is computed up to quartic order of the fluctuating order parameter, and first order in time derivative.
