In the framework of the Einstein-Maxwell-axion-aether theory we establish the model, the Lagrangian of which contains the sin-type generalization of the term describing the axion-photon coupling, and the axionically induced cosine-type modification of the term attributed to the dilatonphoton interactions. The extension of the axion-dilaton-aether electrodynamics is inspired by the Jackson's idea concerning the internal symmetry of the equations of electromagnetism. The application of the extended theory to the anisotropic homogeneous cosmological model of the Bianchi-I type is considered. The exact solutions to the model evolutionary equations are obtained for the case, when the axionic dark matter is in the state of equilibrium, which is characterized by vanishing potential of the pseudoscalar field and its first derivative. The state of the axion-photon system, which is of a new type and is indicated as a dynamic equilibrium, is studied in the framework of electrodynamics with axionic non-linearity. We show that the nonlinear axion-photon interactions can mimic the dilaton-photon coupling. We discuss the stability of the model with respect to homogeneous fluctuations of the axion field.

I. INTRODUCTION
A. On the structure of the nonlinear axion-dilaton electrodynamics
The formalism of nonlinear electrodynamics is well elaborated and documented [1, 2]; it has a lot of applications to the models, which describe the physical systems with strong electromagnetic field (see, e.g., [3]). The theory of gravity involves into consideration the sources, for the description of which the nonlinear electrodynamics is necessary, at least in three cases: when it deals with the astrophysical objects with strong electromagnetic fields [4­9]), with early cosmology in the presence of strong primordial magnetic fields [10­12]), and when the propagation of nonlinear waves is under study [13, 14]. This formalism is based on the work with one true invariant of the electromagnetic field, I1=FmnF mn, and one pseudo-invariant I2=Fm nF mn. The term Fmn denotes the Maxwell tensor, and Fm n is its dual. Starting from the well-known Born-Infeld Lagrangian (see, e.g., [1] for historical details) physicists have invented a lot of special nonlinear Lagrangians (exponential, power-law, fractional, logarithmic, etc.), which can be generally formulated as L(I1, I22) (see, e.g., [4­12]). The theory of interaction between the electromagnetic and scalar fields has involved into the Lagrangian the terms of the form I3 = f ()FmnF mn, where  describes the scalar field, and the function f () is the subject of mathematical

modeling. The theories linear in the electromagnetic field and nonlinear in the scalar field, have been indicated as Maxwell-dilaton theories (see, e.g., [15­22]). The new true scalar I4 = Fm nF mn, where  is the pseudoscalar field, appeared in the electromagnetic theory in the work [23]. Due to the prediction of new light massive pseudoGoldstone bosons, indicated later as axions, [24­26], and due to rapid development of this theory we have now a rather branched axion electrodynamics (see. e.g., [27­ 34]). There exists now the tendency for the unification of the Maxwell-dilaton theory and axion electrodynamics [35­37]), and for formulation of the nonlinear version of this unified theory [38, 39]. In other words, the relativistic astrophysics and cosmology, which operate with the axionic dark matter [40­42] engage the theoreticians for construction of the nonlinear axion-dilaton electrodynamics. If this theory is planned to be formulated on the base of standard Lagrange formalism, it could be equipped by four invariants, listed above: I1, I2, I3, I4, and/or various combinations of these quantities. However, if we act in the spirit of Occam's razor concept, we can formulate the Lagrangian of the nonlinear axion-dilaton electrodynamics L(U) based on appropriate function of one generalized (unified) invariant I, say as L(U)(I). We are ready to postulate this Lagrangian, however, in order to motivate our choice, we invite readers to recall the idea of internal (latent) invariance of classical linear electrodynamics, advocated by Jackson in the textbook [43].

B. Prologue: On the internal (latent) invariance of the classical linear electrodynamics

Equations of vacuum electrodynamics are known to be
symmetric with respect to linear transformation of elec-
tric and magnetic fields [43]. This fact can be illustrated,
for instance, as follows. Let the vacuum Maxwell equations be written using the Maxwell tensor F ik and its dual F ik in the form

kF ik = 0 , kF ik = 0 ,

(1)

where

F

ik

=

1 2

Fmn

,

with

the

Levi-Civita

pseudoten-

sor

=

Eikmn -g

,

(E 0123

=

1).

One can consider the

linear combination of these two tensors

F ik = F ik cos

 2

+ F ik sin

 2

(2)

with a constant angle value , and check that the equations

kF ik = 0 , kF ik = 0

(3)

are valid due to the equations (1). Let us consider the electric field four-vector Ei and the four-vector of the magnetic induction Bi, given by the standard relation-
ships

E i  F ikUk , Bi  F ikUk ,

(4)

where U k is the velocity four-vector, associated with some observer. Then one can obtain from (2) the following relationships:

Ei = Ei cos

,

field (x) depending on coordinates, but they also assumed that the theory is invariant with respect to the discrete symmetry (x)  (x)+2n. In this context it is logical to replace  in (7) with (x) and consider the properties of such Lagrangian.
First of all, when   0, we recover the structure of the classical Lagrangian of the axion electrodynamics

L



1 4

FikF ik + F ikFik

,

(8)

i.e., we deal with the specific sin-type nonlinear general-

ization of the Lagrangian of the axion field.

Second, sin (x) is the odd function, and thus the term

also

is

the

true

invariant.

Third, cos (x) is the even function, thus the first term

in (7) can be represented as

cos |(x)|.

If we

imagine that || = , i.e., it can play the role of a scalar,

this expression looks like the specific (cosin-type) La-

grangian describing the dilaton-photon interactions, with

f () = cos .

Finally, we can suggest that the unified Lagrangian

L(U) = L(U)(I) ,

I



1 4

FikF ik cos (x)+F ikFik sin (x)

(9)

can be chosen as one of the versions appropriate for the nonlinear axion-dilaton electrodynamics. We have to emphasize, that based on the internal symmetry of classical electrodynamics we can motivate the description of both: the dilaton and axion contributions, using only one pseudoscalar field.

which describe, in fact, the rotation in the plane E × B

The Lagrangian con-

structed using the term F ik

(6)

can be rewritten in the following form 1:

L

=

1 4

FikF ik cos  + F ikFik sin 

.

(7)

In other words, we obtain the Lagrangian which admits internal discrete symmetry under the transformation    + 2n (n is an integer). The authors of the axion electrodynamics have introduced the pseudoscalar

1 This idea was inspired by the lecture delivered by Prof. Jackson in Barcelona, 2005.

C. How is the work organized?
Before we establish the full-format nonlinear theory (we hope to do it in the next work), we would like to check the results of the proposed unified approach using the truncated model, in which the pseudoscalar (axion) field is nonlinear (of the sin-type), the induced dilaton field is also nonlinear (of the cosin-type), however the electromagnetic field is described by the linear equations. We add to this model the unit timelike vector field, which describe the velocity of the dynamic aether (see, e.g., [44­49] for details). The last element of the theory, the dynamic aether, is introduced for two reasons. First, this element provides the theory to have the intrinsic preferred velocity field [50, 51], though it translates the theory to the category of the ones with Lorentz violation [52­54]. The second reason is connected with the cosmological interpretation of this unified model: the pseudoscalar field describes the axionic dark matter, and the dynamic aether is known to demonstrate the features associated with the dark energy. The formalism of the dynamic aether is presented in the linear version.

3

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we describe the formalism of the extended Einstein-Maxwellaether-axion theory: we introduce the extended Lagrangian, the modified periodic potential of the axion field, we derive the master equations for the electromagnetic, gravitational, pseudoscalar and unit vector fields. In Section III we consider the cosmological application of the theory using the anisotropic homogeneous Bianchi-I model as an example. Section IV contains discussion and conclusions.

II. MODIFIED EINSTEIN-MAXWELL-AETHER-AXION MODEL

The axion electrodynamics works with the dimension-

less pseudoscalar (axion) field , which is linked with the

quantity (x) by the relationship  =

2 

.

We assume

that both: the pseudoscalars  and  are dimensionless,

and  describes a vacuum averaged value of the axion

field. This idea was motivated and used, e.g., in [55­59]).

Based on this idea we consider now the following unified

invariant I(U) nonlinear in the pseudoscalar field:

F ikFik sin

2 

.

(10)

The multiplier in front of the second term is necessary,

since when the pseudoscalar field is weak, i.e.,

2 

0

just the invariant (10) takes the form

I(U )

advocated by Wei-Tou Ni in [23].

A. The total action functional

We consider the model of interaction of four fields; the gravitational and unit vector fields are the key elements of the Einstein-aether theory [44­49]; the electromagnetic and the pseudoscalar fields appear as the key elements of the axion electrodynamics [24] - [31]. Respectively, we divide the total action functional into two parts:

S(total) = S(EA) + S(MA) .

(12)

The first term given by

-S(EA) =



d4x

(13)

is the standard action functional of the Einstein-aether theory, it contains the determinant of the metric g, the

covariant derivative k, the Ricci scalar R, the cosmological constant , the Einstein constant , the Lagrange multiplier , the unit timelike vector field U i, which is as-
sociated with the velocity four-vector of the aether flow.
The constitutive tensor

(14)

contains four phenomenological constants C1, C2, C3, C4.

The second term in (12) can be represented as follows:

It describes the electromagnetic field of the Maxwell type

The potential of the axion field inherits the discrete

symmetry,

which

in

terms

can

be

indicated

as

therefore,

we

can

use

the

modified

periodic

potential in the form (see, e.g., [55­59]):

V (, )

=

m2A2 22

1 - cos

2 

.

(16)

This periodic potential has the minima at  = n. Near the minima, when   n+ and || is small, the potential takes the standard form V  m2A2, where mA is the axion rest mass. The guiding function  is assumed to depend on the scalar , i.e.,  = (), where   kU k is the expansion scalar of the aether flow. In this sense, below we use the notation V (, ).

C. Master equations of the model

one can rewrite the equation (21) as follows

The spatially homogeneous anisotropic cosmological model of the Bianchi-I type is characterized by the metric

ds2 = dt2 - a2(t)dx2 - b2(t)dy2 - c2(t)dz2 . (32)

We assume that all the physical quantities, which describe the model, inherit the symmetry of this spacetime, in particular, they depend on the cosmological time t only. Also, based on the symmetry of the model we consider the following assumptions: first, the aether velocity four-vector is of the form U i = 0i ; second, the magnetic and electric fields are parallel and are directed along the axis 0z. For this model the covariant derivative of the aether velocity four-vector is symmetric:

1

iUk = kUi = 2 gik .

(33)

Here and below the dot denotes the derivative with respect to cosmological time. As a consequence of (33), the acceleration four-vector is vanishing, DUi = 0, and the expansion scalar is of the form

.

(34)

The last detail of the model restriction is connected with
the fact established by the observation of the events
GW170817 and GRB170817A [60]. The velocity of the
gravitational waves is estimated to differ from the speed of light in vacuum by the quantity of the order 10-15. In
fact, this means that the coupling constants C1 and C3 of the Einstein-aether theory have to satisfy the inequality -6 × 10-15 < C1 + C3 < 1.4 × 10-15. Keeping in mind this estimation, we assume below that C1 + C3 = 0. Now we consider the reduced master equations of the model,
and we start with the equations for the aether velocity.

A. Reduced Master equations

1. Solutions to the Master equations for the aether velocity

The tensor Jaj defined by (19) is now of the form

J aj = C2gaj ,

(35)

and thus, the reduced equations (18) can be rewritten as follows:

2. Solutions to the electrodynamic equations

When the potential of the electromagnetic field depends on the cosmological time only, the equations (23) give the solution

F12 = const = B0 .

(39)

Then we reduce the equations (25) to

the solution to which is

(41)

The quantity E(t)  c(t)F 30 plays the role of the electric field; keeping in mind the initial data at t = t0, we obtain from (41) that

E(t)

=

E(t0)

a(t0)b(t0) cos Y (t0) a(t)b(t) cos Y (t)

.

Below we consider the case, when the initial electric
field in the Universe was absent, E(t0) = 0, and the global magnetic field was the only source of the Universe
anisotropy. Also we assume that at the same time moment, t = t0, the quantity Y (t0) is proportional to 2, i.e., Y (t0) = 2n0, where n0 is some integer. Thus the formula (42) takes the following elegant form:

E(t)

=

B0(t) 2a(t)b(t)

tan Y

(t) .

(43)

For the electromagnetic field with this structure we obtain two invariants of the electromagnetic field:

Based on the solutions to the equations of electrodynamics we can specify the equations for the axion field.

.

This equation is nonlinear, and it does not give a chance

to solve (46) analytically in general case. However, there

are three special cases for which the right-hand side of

this equation vanishes.

1. Axionic dark matter is in a standard equilibrium state.

Let us assume that (t) = n(t); in this case the axion potential (16) and its derivative vanish, and thus we

speak about the equilibrium state of the axionic system

[55]-[59]. Now Y = 2n, sin Y = 0 and thus the right-

hand side of the equation (46) takes zero value. Mention

that the requirement (t) = n(t) itself does not re-

strict the choice of the guiding function (t), however, the remaining equation ¨ +  = 0 predetermines the

behavior of (t).

2. Axionic dark matter is in a dynamic equilibrium state.

Let

us

assume

that

B02 220 a2 b2

2

2 

-2- tan2 Y =m2A.

In this case the potential (16) does not vanish, however,

the contribution of the axion potential to the equation

(46) is compensated by the contribution of the electromagnetic field.

3. Axionic dark matter is in a mixed equilibrium state. Let us assume that the requirements, formulated in the

items 1. and 2., are fulfilled simultaneously; then we obtain the guiding function in the explicit form

 =

 2
. 1 + 20m2Aa2b2
B02

(47)

Clearly, this function has to be constant and the corresponding spacetime should be quasi-static with ab = const. Below we will discuss all three cases in more detail.

4. Reduced equations of the gravity field: Preliminaries

Now we consider the stress-energy tensors (29), (30) and (31), reduced with respect to the symmetry of the Bianchi-I model. First of all we write the stress-energy tensor, which is attributed to the dynamic aether

is indicated by the letters M A and describes the Maxwell

trace of this tensor is nonvanishing. When Y = 0 we

obtain the standard traceless stress-energy tensor of the

electromagnetic field in vacuum.

In order to facilitate the formulation of the reduced

equations of the gravity field we visualize the nonvan-

ishing components of the stress-energy tensors presented

above.

The

key

equations

and

asymptotic behavior of the solutions

We indicate the states of the axionic system as the equilibrium ones, when =n, since this case corresponds to one of the minima of the potential of the axion field (16). Clearly, now Y = 2n, thus sin Y = 0 and the right-hand side of the equation (46) vanishes. The equation for the axion field converts into

¨ +  = 0 ,

(57)

and admits the first integral

 (t)

=

const a(t)b(t)c(t)

.

(58)

For this solution E(t) = 0, the electric field can not be generated, and we are faced with the anisotropic cosmological model with dynamic aether and pure magnetic field. It can be considered as an extension of the known model with the pure magnetic field. We see that now the gravity field equations take the following form:

We see that four equations (59)-(62) contain three metric coefficients a(t), b(t), c(t) and their derivatives only. Since the equations for the electromagnetic and aether vector fields are already solved, and the consequence of the first integral of the axion field equation is inserted into the gravity field equations, then the Bianchi identity is the trivial consequence of (59)-(62). In other words, one of the four equations can be omitted. Also, one can see that the magnetic field B0 is the only spatially anisotropic source of the gravity field, and we can consider the metric with a(t) = b(t) thus assuming that there exist local rotation invariance with respect to the axis 0z. Finally, we assume that the basic state of the equilibrium axion field is associated with the constant value of the function , which yields K = 0. Then we obtain the following two equations for two unknown functions H(t) and (t):

(65)

The unknown metric functions a(t) and c(t) enter the functions H(t) and (t) as follows:

H (t)

(66)

As a consequence of (64), (65), the functions H(t) and (t) are linked by the relationship

(67)

In the asymptotic regime, when t  , a  , H  0,   0, we obtain from (67) and (64 )that

These asymptotic formulas are valid, first, when,  > 0 and  > 0 (de Sitter type asymptote); second, when

Clearly, the asymptotic de Sitter(anti-de Sitter) regime

is provided both: by the cosmological constant  and by

the dynamic aether via the coupling constant C2. When

we

case.

2. On the solutions to the key equations for the case

C2

=

One can reduce the system of equations (64), (65) to one key equation for  using the following scheme. First, we introduce the variable x as follows:

x

=

a(t) a(t0)

,

d = xH(x) d .

(71)

Second, we extract the function H(x) from the quadratic equation (64):

(72)

Third, we put this H(x) into (65) transformed as follows:

xd dx

H (x)

+

1 2

C2

(x)

= (x) - 3H(x) .

(73)

We obtain the nonlinear equation for the function (x), which can be written in the form

(75)

In fact, this equation is the key equation of the model,

since its solution (x) opens the process of subsequent

finding of the functions H(x), a(t), c(t). This equation is

nonlinear and requires the numerical analysis, but here

we attract the attention to one exact solution to this key

equation, which appears if  = 0. Clearly, there exists

the solution of the form

(x)

,

H (x)

=

(1 + C2) x2

(76)

where the parameter  depends on B0 and C2 as follows:

(79)

The corresponding asymptote is characterized by the law

The second metric coefficient c(t) can be found from the relationships

(82)

with the asymptote

In other words, the Universe described by this model expands in the plane x0y and compresses in the direction 0z so that asymptotically abc  const.

The

For this special aether configuration the equation (67) can be rewritten as

d dt

(

=

(

-

3H )

.

(84)

The solution to this equation is

-

3H

=

const a3

,

(85)

and the equation (64) yields

+

B02 2a4

+

(const)2 a6

= 0.

(86)

This equation has no real solutions, when   0. In the anti - de Sitter model, when  < 0, the real solution for a(t) exists, and it is the constant solution a(t) = a. Then H(t) = 0, and



=





const a3

.

(87)

This means that in the plane orthogonal to the magnetic field the Universe does not expand, and the expansion/compression in the 0z direction takes place with the exponential law

c(t) = cet .

(88)

When the constant of integration vanishes, const = 0, we deal with an anisotropic stationary Universe, which is described by the parameters

H = 0,

= 0,

a =

B02 2||

1 4
,

c = const . (89)

In other words, the size of the stationary Universe in the plane x0y is predetermined by the ratio between the amplitude of the magnetic field and the modulus of the negative cosmological constant, while the size in the direction 0z is given by an arbitrary constant.

C. The second submodel: the axion system is in the state of the dynamic equilibrium

The right-hand side of the equation (46) vanishes, when the function Y satisfies the equation

tan2 Y =

2

-

2 B02

B02 + 20m2Aa2b2

.

(90)

We indicate this situation as the dynamic equilibrium in contrast to the standard equilibrium state of the axionic dark matter. The solution to this equation

(91)

has to be supplemented by the requirement

 = K ,

(92)

where K is an integration constant. If, as in the previous case, we put a(t) = b(t), and K = 0, obtaining (t) = (t0), the guiding function (t) will be found as the solution to the transcendent equation, which can be represented in the following convenient form:

a4(Y ) = a~4

Y (t0)

- 2 - tan2 Y

,

(93)

(t)

=

2(t0) Y (t)

,

a~4

=

B02 220m2A

.

(94)

2

The real solution exists, when

Y (t0 )

> 2 + tan2 Y ;

the corresponding time interval is non-empty, when this

inequality holds for t = t0, as well as, the derivative of the

10

right-hand side of (93) at the starting point is positive, i.e., when

|(t0)|

<

|Y (t0) cos Y (t0)| 1 + cos2 Y (t0)

,

|(t0)| <

Y (t0) cos3 Y (t0)| sin Y (t0)

.

(95)

The dynamic equilibrium can not exist during the whole interval of the cosmological expansion t0 < t < ; it can take place up to the critical moment t = tC , which is defined via the critical value Y (tC ), indicated as YC = 0. This critical parameter can be found from the condition that the scale factor reaches the maximum, and it satis-
fies the transcendent equation

YC cos3 YC = 2(t0) sin YC .

(96)

The corresponding maximum value of the Universe radius is given by

aC  a(tC ) =

=

 |B0| 20mA

YC2 4(t0)

2(t0)- cos4 YC

-2

1 4
, (97)

At the critical moment of the cosmological time tC the dynamic equilibrium is assumed to be destroyed due to the cosmological expansion, and the model under discus-
sion becomes invalid. The detailed analysis of the Universe evolution in the time interval t0 < t < tC can be fulfilled only numerically; we hope to do this work in the nearest future.
We would like to emphasize the following detail: the "catastrophic" moment of the cosmological time, t×, for which tan(Y (t×)) =  and the model becomes singular, satisfies the condition t× > tC , thus, we do not take into account such singularity.

D. On the stability of the axionic equilibrium state

When we speak about the problem of the axionic state

stability, we keep in mind two questions. The first ques-

tion is connected with vanishing of the cos Y : whether

the

axion

field

can

reach

the

value



=

±

1 4



?

If

yes, we obtain the catastrophic situation with E = ,

FmnF mn = , etc. If these quantities take finite values

at the finite moments of the cosmological time, the second

question arises connected with the asymptotic stability of

the solutions to the equation of the axion field.

1. When the catastrophic regime can be realized?

For this special behavior of the axion field we can suppose

that the scale factor changes insignificantly, and we can

put a(t)  a(m), and   0. Also, we assume that

during this short interval of time the guiding function

remains constant, and we choose

= 1+ . 2
2 

2m2A 20a4(m) B02

Then after the time re-scaling  = t

we obtain

the following dimensionless equation:

(98)

procedure the first integral

(0) is finite. Y (0) also, belong

to

the

interval

(-

 2

,

 2

),

so that cos Y > 0, there exists some moment  = (m),

for which the right-hand side of the equation (99) van-

ishes. If

1 cos Y

continues to grow, the derivative becomes

imaginary. Thus, at this moment

dY d

((m)) = 0, and

we deal with the maximum of the function Y ( ), and see

that Y

is bounded and Y(max) <

 2

.

The catastrophic

regime can not be realized in this self-closed domain of

the integral curves.

2)

If

Y

(

)

belongs

to

the

interval

(

 2

,

3 2

),

so that cos Y

<

0, the right-hand side of the equation (99) becomes un-

bounded and can reach arbitrary value. In this domain

the catastrophic regime is possible.

The same results can be obtained based on the theory

of autonomous dynamic systems; indeed, the equation

(98) can be rewritten as

dY d

dX d

-

sin Y cos2 Y

.

(100)

In fact, this set of equations represents the modified phys-

ical pendulum; the singular points remain the same (the

knots at Y = 2m and saddle points at Y = (2m + 1));

unbounded, so the catastrophic regime is possible.

Clearly, the model, which we used for interpretation,

is truncated; we assume that the complete model will be

analyzed in the next work.

2. Asymptotic stability of the solutions near the equilibrium state

We assume that the functions a(t), b(t), (t) are found from the equations of the leading order. With the replacement

(102)

we reduce the equation (101) to the form

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

1. In the framework of the Einstein-Maxwell-axion-

aether theory we have formulated the model, into which

the pseudoscalar (axion) field enters nonlinearly, and the

electromagnetic and the unit vector fields appear in the

linear form. This approach is based on the idea that

the equations of electromagnetism are invariant with re-

spect to the rotations in the plane coordinated by the

electric and magnetic fields [43]. This symmetry hinted

us to modify non-linearly (sin-type non-linearity) the ac-

tion functional of the axion electrodynamics, and we ob-

tained that in addition to the sin-type modification of

the axion-photon term, we have found out the cosine-

type modification of the dilaton-photon term. In other

words, working with only one (axion) field, one can ef-

fectively introduce the dilaton terms. This means that

the nonlinear axion-photon interactions can mimic the

dilaton-photon coupling, or equivalently, the dilaton field

can be considered as the field induced by the axion field.

2. The behavior of the axionic dark matter is regu-

lated by the modified periodic potential (16), in which the

guiding function  plays the role of a vacuum average value of the pseudoscalar field. The same guiding func-

tion is used in (15), though one could introduce another

guiding function, say . We keep in mind the arguments of the Occam's razor concept, and put  = . The bonus of this idea is the following. In addition to

the standard equilibrium states, for which  = n and thus the axion potential and its derivative vanish (n is an

integer), we got the opportunity to introduce the state

of a new type, namely, the dynamic equilibrium state.

Mathematically, this state is defined by (90), (91); from

the physical point of view it relates to the case, when the

axion potential and its derivative are not equal to zero,

but the axionic contribution to the equation (46) is com-

pensated by the electromagnetic one. In principle, there

exist a mixed equilibrium state, when both requirements

are valid simultaneously (see, e.g., (47)), however, such

an equilibrium can take place only in stationary models

with constant scale factors.

of an anomaly, which could appears, when the argument

to

In particular, in the

Bianchi-I anisotropic homogeneous cosmological model

with initial magnetic field we see that the axionically in-

duced electric field (43) and the corresponding sources

of the gravity field (see, e.g., (55)) contain the function

cos-1

,

which

.

According to the illustration discussed in Section IIID1,

if the starting state of the axionic dark matter is near the

equilibrium point, related to the minimum of the axion

potential, the catastrophic regime can not be realized,

12

though the axionically induced electric field can reach

rather big values. If the system starts to evolve from the

state related to the maximum of the axion field potential,

the anomalous grow of the state functions is inevitable.

Such a model might be useful in the theory of anisotropic

cosmological inflation.

4. What is the role of the dynamic aether in the cos-

mological evolution of the axion-photon system? The

obtained results contain only one Jacobson's parameter,

C2. The parameter C3 is assumed to be equal to -C1, providing the speed of gravity waves in the aether coin-

cides with the speed of light [60]. The parameters C1, C4 remain hidden in the model with the chosen spacetime symmetry. The parameter C2 enters the asymptotic

value of the Hubble function H =

 3

,



=

1+

3 2

C2,

thus predetermining the rate of the Universe expansion

on the final stage of evolution. The critical value of this

parameter

C2

=

-

2 3

relates

to

the

model,

for

which

the

size of the Universe in the plane orthogonal to the mag-

netic field is fixed. The main channel of influence of the

dynamic aether on the axionic dark matter is connected

with the covariant divergence of the velocity four-vector

of the aether,  = kU k. We introduced this scalar into the guiding function (), which enters the potential of the axion field (16), describes the vacuum average value

of the pseudoscalar field and predetermines the scale of the equilibrium levels for the axion field,  = n.
5. The presented model opens up a wide range of opportunities for modeling of the physical phenomena in the expanding Universe. In this paper we formulated the key equations of the Bianchi-I model with local rotation symmetry, and discussed examples of exact solutions; the detailed numerical analysis is in our nearest plans. For instance, generally, the obtained key equation (74) with (75) requires numerical modeling with wide choice of the guiding parameters , C2, B0; however, for the special submodel with  = 0 and  = const, we have found the exact solution in the analytic form (76) with (77), which allows us to reconstruct immediately the scale factors a(t) (79), and c(t) (82).
