(Dated: June 4, 2021)
We study a predictive model for explaining the apparent deviation of the muon anomalous magnetic moment from the Standard Model expectation. There are no new scalars and hence no new hierarchy puzzles beyond those associated with the Higgs; the only new particles at the TeV scale are vector-like singlet and doublet leptons. Interestingly, this simple model provides a calculable example violating the Wilsonian notion of naturalness: despite the absence of any symmetries prohibiting its generation, the coefficient of the naively leading dimension-six operator for (g-2) vanishes at one-loop. While effective field theorists interpret this either as a surprising UV cancellation of power divergences, or as a delicate cancellation between matching UV and calculable IR corrections to (g - 2) from parametrically separated scales, there is a simple explanation in the full theory: the loop integrand is a total derivative of a function vanishing in both the deep UV and IR. The leading contribution to (g - 2) arises from dimension-eight operators, and thus the required masses of new fermions are lower than naively expected, with a sizeable portion of parameter space already covered by direct searches at the LHC. The remaining parameter space free of fine-tuning for the muon mass will be fully covered by future direct LHC searches, and all of the parameter space can be probed by precision measurements at planned future lepton colliders.

I. INTRODUCTION

Precise measurements of the muon anomalous magnetic moment, (g - 2)µ, are sensitive to the interactions of the muon with new particles. The BNL E821 experiment [1] observed a deviation of (g - 2)µ from the Standard Model (SM) prediction as large as the electroweak contribution. The SM prediction has been improved [2] and the BNL measurement has been confirmed by the Fermilab E989 experiment [3]. The deviation is now

While the status of the SM computation remains uncertain­given the tension between the data-

driven approaches to hadronic vacuum polarization contributions going into the above deviation

and recent high-precision lattice QCD simulations that appear to largely eliminate the anomaly [4]­

for the purposes of this note we will take this measurement as a hint of new physics. Since (g -2)µ breaks the chiral symmetry of the muon, quantum corrections generating (g -2)µ,
with the external photon removed, necessarily generate a muon mass, mµ. Assuming that mµ and (g - 2)µ are given by the dimension-four and six operators respectively, the relation between aµ, mµ, and the new physics mass scale M is generically given by

aµ mµ



mµ M2

.

(2)

If mµ is a perturbative correction to the tree-level muon Yukawa coupling, mµ  2mµ/(4), the expected new particle masses are around M  100 GeV. Charged particles near 100 GeV

would have been copiously produced at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which has not seen any such signals. Thus one needs an enhancement of aµ in comparison with mµ, such as the tan enhancement in supersymmetric theories [5­7]. If, on the other hand, mµ originates from muon chiral symmetry breaking beyond the muon Yukawa coupling, it may be as large as mµ (or larger if the muon mass is fine-tuned) without loop suppression [8, 9]. Then the expected new physics scale is M  2 TeV. The present LHC constraints are easily satisfied, but the new particles may

be beyond the reach of the LHC and near-future colliders.

There are a priori a huge range of possibilities for the new particles running inside the loop responsible for (g - 2)µ, many of which have been explored for several decades. But the larger theoretical context in which to consider possible new physics explanations for (g - 2)µ has changed radically over the past decade, due to the absence of "natural new physics" at the LHC to explain

the origin of the Higgs mass scale. This suggests at least a "little hierarchy" between the weak scale

3
and the cutoff of the SM effective theory, and makes it even more plausible than it may already have been in the past, to imagine that the Higgs is tuned to be light for anthropic reasons. If we take this picture seriously, we are led to a much more constrained set of possibilities for explaining (g - 2)µ, since there is no reason to have any other light scalars at the TeV scale­as they serve no anthropic purpose­and absent light scalars to higgs them, we should not expect new gauge bosons either. Thus we can only imagine theories with new vector-like fermions at the TeV scale, whose masses are protected by chiral symmetries.
Models for (g - 2)µ motivated by this philosophy were investigated in [10, 11]. Emphasis was put on models with electromagnetic charged vector-like leptons in SU (2)L singlets or triplets. In order to generate a large enough (g - 2)µ, in these theories the muon mass dominantly arises from the tree-level exchange of heavy vector-like leptons generating a dimension-six operator ecH|H|2, and it is expected that the h-µµ¯ coupling is larger than the SM prediction. The recent upper bound on the coupling [12, 13] disfavors this type of model, although it is possible to tune the parameters so that the coupling is suppressed.
Perhaps the simplest possible model along these lines has a single new vector-like SU (2)L doublet and a gauge singlet. The tree-level exchange of the heavy fermions does not give a muon Yukawa coupling, so that the h-µµ¯ coupling is guaranteed to be the SM-like. This setup was also briefly mentioned in [10] and analyzed in [14].
In this note, we would look to draw attention to a very simple but intriguing feature of (g-2)µ in this model, which also has immediate phenomenological implications. We find that ironically, this model, whose sparse structure was motivated by the "unnaturalness" of the SM Higgs, itself gives sharp violation of Wilsonian naturalness in the computation of (g - 2)µ! As we will see, despite the absence of any obvious symmetry that prevents the generation of (g - 2)µ by a dimensionsix operator, it vanishes at one-loop level. In the effective field theory after integrating out both vector-like fermions, the vanishing (g-2)µ is seen as a surprising absence of quadratically (or higher power) divergent correction to it. In the effective field theory at energy scales between the two vector-like fermions, the vanishing (g - 2)µ is seen as a delicately fine-tuned cancellation between a calculable IR contribution to (g - 2)µ and a matching UV contribution. In the full UV theory, all of this is understood as a consequence of the fact that the loop integrand is a total derivative of a function that vanishes, for simple reasons, in both the deep UV and deep IR.
Apart from giving a concrete examples of "absence of power divergences" and "UV-IR correlation mechanism" at work violating the Wilsonian naturalness, this phenomenon has an important phenomenological consequence. The actual leading contribution to (g-2)µ comes from a dimension-

4
eight operator whose effect is suppressed by m2W /M 2, and hence the masses of the new fermions are required to be smaller that the M  2 TeV scale expected from the naive estimates to explain the (g - 2)µ anomaly. As result, a sizeable portion of the parameter space has been already ruledout by direct searches for vector-like leptons at the LHC. The portion of the remaining parameter space that is free of fine-tuning for the muon mass will be incisively probed by future direct LHC searches, while all of the parameter space can be probed by precision measurements at planned future lepton colliders.

II. THE MODEL AND ANOMALOUS MAGNETIC MOMENT

We extend the SM by vector-like leptons L, Lc, S, and Sc. L/Lc have the same/opposite gauge charge as/to the SM lepton doublets and SSc are gauge singlets. We introduce the following Yukawa couplings and Dirac masses,

L = - YL ScH - YRLecH - YV SLcH - YV LScH - mLLLc - mSSSc + h.c.,

(3)

where H is the SM Higgs, is the doublet containing the left-handed muon, and ec is the right-

handed muon. Since couples only to a neutral fermion Sc, the tree-level exchange of the heavy fermions does

not generate a muon Yukawa coupling. One-loop quantum corrections given by Fig. 1 without the

external photon lines generate a muon Yukawa coupling,

the setup into a "minimally split" supersymmetric theory with scalar masses around 100-1000 TeV

scales, where the muon mass (together with the electron and tau masses) may be fully radiatively

generated, but now turn to the computation of (g - 2)µ.

A. One-loop correction to dimension-six operator
At the dimension-six level, (g - 2)µ arises from left-right mixing operators H D2ec and H µecFµ, or chirality conserving operators ¯µD Fµ and ec¯µDecFµ. The contribution of latter operators to (g - 2)µ is suppressed by m2µ/M 2, and as we have discussed, require M  100 GeV for perturbative couplings and so are excluded by direct LHC searches. We hence focus on the direct left-right mixing operators. We naively expect that the dominant contribution comes from

the correction around the energy scale mS, mL mW , so we use the Higgs picture and consider the diagrams in Fig. 1 that would generate a dimension-six operator H D2ec. The contribution of the diagrams to (g - 2)µ, however, vanishes as we show below.
It is easy to see that the contribution to (g - 2)µ from µqµ is absent; putting pµ  0 the only linear dependence on qµ comes through the photon vertex and vanishes since · q = 0. We may thus put q = 0 and see the dependence on p in order to compute the correction to (g - 2)µ. The correction from the bottom diagram is proportional to

To compute (g - 2)µ, it is enough to see the terms linear in p, so one may put p2 = 0 in the L propagator in the second term. Because of the partial cancellation between the two terms, the correction to (g - 2)µ from the top two diagrams is also proportional to Eq. (5).

FIG. 2. The leading order loop integrand for (g - 2)µ. The integral vanishes due to a cancellation between opposite sign contributions around the scales mL, mS of the heavy fermions, as guaranteed by the fact that the integrand is a total derivatve vanising at both zero and infinity. To clarify the structure of the integrand, we take mL = 103mS.

Expanding the integrand in Eq. (5) to the linear order in p, the correction to (g - 2)µ is proportional to the integral

where u = k2. The integral of the total derivative f (u) vanishes since f () = f (0) = 0. The fact that f ()  0 is an obvious consequence of dimensional analysis/UV calculability of (g - 2)µ, while the fact that f (0)  0 is slightly more interesting. Mechanically, the explicit factor of u in the numerator of f (u) straightforwardly appears in the bottom diagram of Fig. 1, while it arises from a partial cancellation between the top two diagrams. In both cases there is a simple reason why we must have that f (0) = 0: upon integrating out the massive leptons at tree-level and working at zero external momentum, the operator with no derivatives ( H)HHec identically vanishes due to anti-symmetric contraction of the SU (2) indices in HH.
We have understood why the full one-loop integral for (g - 2)µ is obviously zero, being a total derivative vanishing in both the deep IR and UV, but it is also instructive to look at the energy dependence of the loop integrand to see how this happens more explicitly. The loop integrand is plotted in Fig. 2, where to better illustrate the point, mL is taken to be much larger than mS. We see that there are two contributions at widely different scales, near mS and mL, which "conspire" to cancel exactly. Analytically, we can see this exact cancellation between S and L contributions

We have seen why the full integral is guaranteed to vanish. However, any effective field theory

calculation chops this integral into an "IR contribution" and a "UV matching" part, and in any

such separation, the final result of zero will appear to come from a delicate cancellation between

the "IR" and "UV" contributions.

Consider very low-energy effective field theorists, living at energies much smaller than both

mS, mL. Looking at the low-energy part of the integrand beneath mS and mL, they would estimate the integral, cutting it off around the scale mS. Note for small u, we have that f (u)  u/(m2Sm2L), thus f (u) is a constant and so the integral is quadratically divergent in the UV. This power-

UV divergence has an obvious interpretation. Integrating out S and L at tree-level gives us a

dimension-eight operator,

(9)

This operator breaks the chiral symmetry on the muons that protects both the dimension-four

Yukawa coupling and the dimension-six (g - 2)µ operators. Thus by closing the Higgs loop (and attaching photons for (g - 2)µ) as in the left panel of Fig. 3, we can generate the dimension-four Yukawa coupling and dimension-six (g - 2)µ operators from quartic and quadratic divergences in this loop. (Note that the derivative D/ 2 in Eq. (9) acts on the internal H). Of course as always

power-divergences are not calculable in the effective theory, but by the usual logic of naturalness,

their presence is an indication for the size of the operator we can expect from dimensional analysis,

and thus give an estimate for what we would get from the full UV theory.

Indeed, we do obtain a dimension-four muon Yukawa operator as confirmed by the full UV

theory computation resulting in Eq. (4). But the naturalness expectation for dimension-six (g -

2)µ operators is false; the correction is exactly zero in the full UV theory. The very low-energy

effective field theorist thus sees that there is a dimension-eight operator breaking the relevant

chiral symmetries, and also dimension-four Yukawa of about the right size expected from the

quartically divergent estimate, but that the dimension-six (g - 2)µ operator is absent. Note that the cancellation happens from the contribution around mL, which is far above the cutoff mS of

the very low-energy effective theory. This is a concrete realization of the slogan that "power

divergences are absent for UV reasons, far above the naive cutoff of the effective theory", which is

sometimes invoked to motivate how mysterious UV phenomena at the Planck scale might change

the naturalness estimates for the Higgs mass or the cosmological constant at far lower scales.

The surprise is perhaps more acute to the effective field theorist who lives at energy scales

between mS and mL. Integrating out L at tree-level generates the operator

(10)

Closing the Higgs and S loop with the Yukawa coupling YL, a dimension-six operator is generated

around the energy scale mS. This is a fully calculable IR contribution to (g - 2)µ. But in this

effective theory, there is also a UV matching contribution to (g - 2)µ, from integrating out physics

above the scale mL, that cancels the calculable IR contribution exactly. To the effective field

theorist living between mS, mL, this looks like a "UV-IR connection/conspiracy", again of the sort

sometimes hoped for in connection with the hierarchy and cosmological constant problems. But

again everything has a very simple explanation, following from the "total derivative phenomenon"

in the full theory. In our computation of the loop integral, we took the Higgs mass m2H to be zero, as appropriate
for leading effects in the effective theory far above the weak scale. A non-zero m2H does give a nonvanishing integral. This is understood as the renormalization group equation (RGE) correction to

the dimension-six (g - 2)µ operator from the product of a dimension-eight operator in Eq. (9) and the dimension-two m2H |H|2 Higgs mass operator. One should, however, consistently include the correction from the Higgs quartic |H|4 to a dimension-eight (g -2)µ operator with additional |H|2.

9
Adding them up as in the middle panel of Fig. 3, the correction is proportional to 2|H|2 +m2H and vanishes at the minimum of the Higgs potential. This is not an accident, since at the minimum, the mass of the would-be charged Nambu-Goldstone scalar vanishes, and as we have seen, the one-loop contribution from a massless charged scalar vanishes.
The massless scalar inside the loop and f (0)  0, which result in the vanishing (g - 2)µ at the leading order, are an important consequences of our assumption­motivated by anthropic considerations­that there are no scalars beyond the Higgs running in the loops for (g - 2)µ. If the scalar inside the loop in Fig. 1 is a new scalar field , the one-loop correction is non-zero. Such a setup is considered in [14, 15]. The top two diagrams are generically dependent on different Yukawa couplings, and the partial cancellation in Eq. (6), which leads to f (0)  0, no longer occurs. This is reflected in the fact that an operator without derivative ( )Hec does not identically vanish. In the bottom diagram, f (0) is still zero, because the tree-level exchange of Sc and L does not generate the operator ( )Hec. Diagramatically, this is due to the absence of the chirality flip in the Sc and L propagators. Perhaps a more interesting way to understand this is to observe that when YV = 0 and the scalars are treated as non-dynamical fields, the theory has a symmetry under which c and Lc are simultaneously shifted by a constant. The shift symmetry forbids the generation of the operator ( )Hec. Although f (0) = 0, since the scalar inside the loop is massive, non-zero (g - 2)µ is generated at the leading order, but is suppressed by m2/m2S,L if m2 < m2S,L.

B. One-loop correction to dimension-eight operator

We next consider dimension-eight operators |H|2H µecFµ and |H|2H D2ec. In the full UV theory, the operators are generated by the diagrams shown in Fig. 4. In the low energy effective

theory after integrating out L and S, the correction is understood as the RGE correction from the

dimension-eight operator in Eq. (9) to the dimension-eight (g - 2)µ operators as is shown in the right panel of Fig. 3. For mS mL, we obtain

Note that there should not be a RGE correction at the energy scales between mL and mS and hence a log-factor log(mL/mS) is absent for the following reason. After integrating out L, we obtain dimension-seven and six operators in Eq. (10). In concert with the marginal and relevant

operators in the model, by dimensional analysis these operators can not generate dimension-eight

operators under the RG.

FIG. 4. Diagrams that generate dimension-eight (g - 2)µ operators in the full UV theory.

Since mS and/or mL are not much above mW , we need to go beyond the leading-log approximation and compute the full one-loop contribution to (g -2)µ. We work in unitary gauge and compute the diagrams shown in Fig. 4. From our previous discussions in the Higgs picture above the weak

scale, the contribution from the longitudinal component of the W bosons with high momenta

should vanish. In fact we find that this contribution vanishes identically at all loop momenta, and

only the transverse component of the W boson propagator contributes in unitary gauge. The final

correction to (g - 2)µ is

(12)

As can be seen from Eqs. (4) and (12), after choosing the signs of the parameters so that aµ > 0, the correction to the muon mass is negative, mµ < 0. This means that one cannot obtain the muon mass solely from the radiative correction at the energy scales below  while explaining the deviation of (g - 2)µ. A non-zero muon Yukawa ecH or a mass term Lc are required as the boundary values at the scale , which may come from radiative corrections as we will discuss later.

C. Two-loop correction to dimension-six operator
Since the leading one-loop contribution to (g - 2)µ is suppressed by m2W /m2L,S, two-loop corrections without the suppression dominates over the one-loop correction for mS,L mW . We will now examine the leading two-loop correction to the dimension-six operator­coming from the top Yukawa couplings­although as we will see, in the parameter range that can explain the observed deviation of (g - 2)µ this correction turns out to be numerically significantly smaller than the

11

dimension-eight one-loop contribution.

The top Yukawa correction arises from diagrams adding a top-loop to Fig. 1, with the photon attached to the left of the top loop, to the tops in the loop, and to the right of of the top loop. Since the electromagnetic current is not renormalized, the sum of these correction is simply proportional to the top-loop correction to the Higgs wavefunction renormalization. This amounts to modifying the integrand for (g - 2)µ in Eq. (7) as

(14)

Although the correction involves a factor of log(mL/mS), this is not from the RGE correction between mL and mS. This is evident from the form of the integrand that is shown in Fig. 2; the integrand is peaked at m2S and m2L with opposite signs. The contributions from these two peaks exactly cancel without the extra log-dependence. With the extra log-factor, the cancellation is imperfect and results in a factor logmL - logmS = log(mL/mS). The non-zero correction proportional to log(mL/mS) should be thus understood as the sum of two threshold corrections (whose magnitudes logarithmically depend on the energy scale) at the scales mL and mS rather than as the RGE effect between mL and mS.
The correction does not involve log(mL,S/mW ), in contrast to the log(mL,S/mW ) enhancement in the dimension-eight (g - 2)µ operator, for the following reason. For such a factor to arise, the dimension-six (g - 2)µ operators must be generated from other dimension-six operators through the RGE after integrating out L and S. However, the operator D/ 2ecH can be removed by a field redefinition shifting of proportional to D/ (ecH), and does not contribute to the RGE. After the shift, a dimension-six operator proportional to the muon Yukawa coupling remains, but (g - 2)µ from that coupling is proportional to m2µ and is negligible.
Two-loop corrections from other interactions, such as the electroweak gauge interactions and the Higgs quartic coupling, also generate (g - 2)µ. For the same reason as the top loop, a factor log(mL,S/mW ) is absent. We find that these corrections are negligible in the parameter region that can explain the deviation of (g - 2)µ unless a numerical factor in addition to the loop factor 1/(162)2 and a log-enhancement log(mL/mS) is more than 30, and neglect them. It will be, however, of interest to perform a full two-loop computation.

III. PHENOMENOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS

In Fig. 5, we show the constraints on mL and mS, requiring aµ = (2.51-0.59)×10-9. We take YV = 1 and YV = 0 in the left panel and YV = 0 and YV = 1 in the right panel. In the gray-shaded region, YLYR > 1, for which the Higgs potential becomes unstable below 10 TeV. The dashed black lines show the contours of mµ/mµ assuming  = 105 GeV; lowering  reduces mµ/mµ.
The doublets L and Lc are produced at colliders and decay into the SM leptons and W , Z,

or Higgs bosons. The search for such signals in [16] assumes an SU (2)L triplet fermion, but we

expect that the constraint for triplets is similar to that for doublets up to the three times larger

cross section. We then obtain a bound mL > 650 GeV, which is shown as the green-shaded region

in Fig. 5. Note that this search assumes direct decay of the triplet into SM particles, while in our

set-up, L can first decay into S and H, and S can decay into and H, but we expect the constraints

to be similar. The sensitivity can be improved by utilizing extra leptons or looking for peaks at

the invariant mass of the intermediate S. High-Luminosity LHC can probe vector-like leptons with

a mass mL < 1250 GeV even if they dominantly couple with the third generation leptons [17].

Because of the dominant coupling with the muon, we expect better sensitivity in our set-up; the

parameter space without significant tuning in mµ will thus be incisively probed by future searches

at the LHC.

The parameter space of the model can be also probed by the precise measurements of Z and

W boson decays. After integrating out the vector-like leptons, we obtain effective operators

The W -µ and Z- couplings decrease since the SM-like µ contains a small fraction of a singlet

Direct collider search for S produced by the mixing of it with the SM neutrinos also puts an upper bound on YLv/mS [19]. These indirect and direct bounds on YL and YR as well as the requirement of YL,R < 1 exclude the red-shaded region in Fig. 5.
Future lepton colliders can probe the full parameter space of the theory. Lepton universality in W decays can be measured with an accuracy of 6 × 10-4 by e-L eR+  W -W + with s = 250 GeV and the integrated luminosity of 0.9 ab-1 at the International Linear Collider [20]. A GigaZ factory can measure the Z-µ coupling with an accuracy of 2 × 10-4 [20]. Similar sensitivities for precision measurements of W/Z couplings are expected at the Circular Electron Positron Collider [21, 22]. These measurements cover all of the viable parameter regions for explaining (g - 2)µ, as indicated by the red dashed lines with labels "W  e/µ + " and "GigaZ" in Fig. 5.
In Fig. 6, we instead fix the Yukawa couplings so that mµ = -3mµ. Inside the blue band, aµ = (2.51 ± 0.59) × 10-9. Other constraints and prospects are the same as those in Fig. 5. Again, future lepton colliders can probe the entire viable parameter region.
IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
We studied a simple model that can explain the observed deviation of the muon anomalous magnetic moment from the (data-driven) SM prediction. The model only introduces new vector-like fermions and does not suffer from naturalness problems beyond that of the SM Higgs, compatible with an anthropic explanation for the small weak scale.
Because of the absence of new scalars around the TeV scale, the model can be easily embedded into a framework with a little hierarchy. Perhaps the best-motivated are supersymmetric theories with squarks and sleptons around the 100 - 1000 TeV scale [23­30]. The large scalar mass is not only consistent with the observed Higgs mass of 125 GeV, but also is free from the flavor, gravitino, and moduli problems. Because of the large scalar mass, correction to (g - 2)µ are dominated by loops of the vector-like fermions and the W boson we have studied. The cut-off scale  is identified with the mass of the heavy scalars.
The model with YV = 0 can be embedded into a theory where the muon mass (as well the tau and electron masses) can be generated radiatively. We may introduce a U (1) symmetry with charges (-2), ec(0), L(0), Lc(1), S(-1), and Sc(2). The symmetry forbids a tree-level muon Yukawa coupling ecH and YV . We introduce a soft breaking of the symmetry by mL and mS. The same spurion with an opposite U (1) charge can give a mass term Lc, but that may be forbidden by the holomorphy in supersymmetric theories. The muon Yukawa coupling is given by the radiative

15
correction below the scale  shown in Eq. (4) and a threshold correction at , namely, the soft scalar mass scale. The latter must dominate over the former and flip the sign of the muon mass to explain the sign of the deviation of (g - 2)µ, as can be seen from Eqs. (4) and (12). Note that this gives an extra motivation, beyond the simple story for supersymmetry breaking and successful prediction for the Higgs mass, for only a "mini-split" spectrum, to avoid too large logarithmic enhancement of the running contribution to the muon Yukawa. The needed threshold correction can arise, for example, by a Higgsino-scalar SSc loop with a moderately large BmS term.
The electron and tau masses can be also radiatively generated by introducing extra vector-like leptons that have the same charge as LLc and SSc and couple to electrons and taus in the same manner as in Eq. (3). Because of the dependence of the radiatively generated charged lepton masses on the cubic power of the Yukawa couplings in Eq. (3), O(0.1-1) hierarchy in the Yukawa couplings between generations can explain the charged lepton mass hierarchy. It is also possible to extend the model so that the electron mass arises at two-loop level by generating a coupling or a mass in Eq. (3) by one-loop radiative corrections.
Sadly, a lepton flavor symmetry should be introduced to suppress flavor changing decays such as µ  e. The neutrino mixing, which violates the lepton flavor symmetry, may arise from soft breaking of the symmetry. For example, we may consider a see-saw mechanism [31­34] with the lepton symmetry and the lepton flavor symmetry softly broken by right-handed neutrino masses. We may also introduce soft breaking by the Majorana mass of S and/or Sc. These lepton flavor violations break the lepton number by two units and do not generate a lepton flavor violation in the charged lepton sector.
If the vector-like leptons for the electron Yukawa is as light as those for the muon Yukawa, to avoid too large an electron electric dipole moment (EDM), an (approximate) CP symmetry must be introduced, to ensure phase alignment between the electron mass and dipole moment operators at the 10-4 level. The electron EDM can be suppressed without the CP symmetry if the masses of the vector-like fermions for the electron Yukawa are heavier. In this limit the two-loop correction involving the top Yukawa coupling dominates the EDM, and the required masses of the vector-like fermions are O(100) TeV. Note that in the model with YV = 0, the induced Yukawas are supressed by mS/mL, thus keeping the electron-singlet S light but making the electron-doublet L heavy, near  100 TeV, would generate the e-µ Yukawa hierarchy while evading a large EDM, even with no suppression of the CP phase.
In order to preserve the success of supersymmetric gauge-coupling unification, the new vectorlike leptons should be embedded into complete 5 + ¯5 + 1 + 1 multiplets in SU (5), by supplementing

16
the model with D and Dc with the opposite and same gauge charges as the right-handed down quark. Unlike models with hyper-charged SU (2)L singlets, we do not need 10 in SU (5), and so the perturbativity of the gauge couplings can be easily maintained up to the GUT scale. If the U (1) symmetry discussed above acts on the full 5-plets, a tree-level strange Yukawa coupling is forbidden. Also, because of the absence of the colored Higgs, quantum corrections to the strange mass are absent at the TeV scale. But the mini-split supersymmetry spectrum offers other simple sources of radiative Yukawas, from integrating out squarks with flavor-violating soft masses, or via the addition of additional vector-like matter at the 100 - 1000 TeV scale. Alternately the U (1) symmetry can be taken to act only on the leptons, in which case a tree-level Yukawa for the down-type quarks is allowed.
Given the new colored states D, Dc needed to preserve unification, it is tempting to try and explain the observed lepton non-universality of the B meson decay [35] by the quantum correction from the box diagram involving the loop of S, D and H. But this is easily seen to be impossible. In order to avoid the constraint from the Bs-Bs mixing [36], the Yukawa coupling qDcH must be small, forcing non-perturbatively large coupling to leptons in order to get a large enough correction to Bs  µ+µ-.
As we discussed in this note, in our simple model, the quantum correction to dimension-six (g - 2)µ operators vanishes at one-loop level, lowering the required new physics mass scale. The viable parameter space can be fully probed by the LHC and planned future lepton colliders. Let us conclude by making some further simple observations on this interesting counterexample to Wilsonian naturalness we have encountered here.
Recall that the left-right dimension-six operators contributing to (g - 2) are of the form HOec where O is either O = D2 or µFµ. (Of course these operators are equivalent when and ec are on-shell, since D/ 2 = D2 + µFµ and D/ 2ec = m2ec on-shell). For simplicity, let us focus on a limit where the coupling YV  0, so only the bottom diagram in Fig. 1 contributes to (g - 2)µ. (A slight elaboration of the following discussion applies to the general case where both YV , YV are non-zero). Note that with the Higgs set to its vacuum expectation value, the exchanged fermion is neutral, so the only photon insertion comes on the charged scalar line in the diagram, and thus it is obvious that the spinor contractions between  and ec is proportional to . Therefore the dimension-six operator contributing to (g - 2) must be HD2ec. Amusingly, this allows to compute (g - 2) using diagrams without any photons attached, instead just computing the coefficient of p2 in the expansion of the one-loop correction to the left-right two-point function. This argument extends to corrections at all loop order for corrections that are represented as blobs modifying the

17

Higgs propagator or the Higgs-Higgs-photon vertex, since all such corrections have the same trivial

spinor contraction structure. (This includes the case of the two-loop top Yukawa contribution we

discussed above, where the correction involved only the Higgs wavefunction renormalization factor,

just as expected from examining the two-point function without a photon attached).

The argument also extends to the case where any number of photons are attached to the charged

Higgs line; the only operators that can be generated are of the form H(D2)nec, whose coefficients

can be computed from diagrams with no photons attached, by looking at the coefficient of (p2)n

in the expansion of the left-right two-point function A(p2).

The surprise that (g - 2) vanishes at this order extends to the vanishing of all operators

H(D2)nec, arising from the (p2)-expansion of the two-point function:

A(p2) =

d4k k2

+(p2)2 du 1 f + 1 uf + 1 u2f

+··· .

(18)

Note that all the coefficients of positive powers of (p2) involve integrals of the form duurf (s)(u), with s > r. Integrating by parts, all these integrals are seen to vanish since f (u)  0 both as u  0 and u  . A similar statement holds in any even number of spacetime dimensions D. The integrand above is multiplied by an extra Jacobian factor of uD/2-2, and thus all coefficients of (p2)m with m  (D/2 - 1) involve integrals of the form duurf (s) with s > r and hence vanish. This does not happen for odd spacetime dimensions, where the Jacobian involves odd powers of 
u and the integration-by-parts argument fails. Note also that this argument extends to any higher-loop corrections attached as blobs only to the neutral fermion line; they only change the detailed form of the function f (u) but do not change that f (u)  0 as u  0,  and thus the vanishing after integration by parts.
It is perhaps also worth remarking that a milder (if quite familiar) sort of "surprise" already occurs in this model at tree-level. Upon integrating out the heavy fermions, there are no symmetries to prevent the generation of the dimension-six operator H|H|2ec that would contribute to the muon mass, but the operator is actually not generated at tree-level. Of course the mechanical reason for this is trivial: putting the Higgs to its vacuum expectation value, we only have mixing with the neutral components of the heavy fermions and so obviously no muon mass term can be generated.

18

Instead we get the dimension-eight operator we have already discussed above, ( H)HD/ 2(Hec). As we stressed, the potential dimension-six operator ( H)HHec vanishes due to the antisymmetric

SU (2) contraction of the indices. This "accident" is crucial for the total derivative argument,

guaranteeing f (u)  0 as u  0.

We have given a rather technical,"off-shell" understanding for the vanishing of the leading

contribution to (g - 2)µ in our model, it would be nice to find a more conceptual explanation. For instance, there should be a simple "on-shell" understanding of the phenomenon. After all, the

leading left-right operator contributing to (g -2)/m is most invariantly thought of as the coefficient

of three-particle amplitude for two massless fermions and a photon, with all + or all - helicity, as

A(1 + 2 + 3+) = [(g - 2)/m][13][23]. There must be a simple on-shell understanding for why this

massless three-particle amplitude is not forced on us at one-loop, but can be generated at higher loop orders or subleading orders in (m2W /M 2).
It would also be interesting to find a symmetry argument that makes the result completely

obvious without any detailed calculations. Of course, when ordinary symmetries protect the gen-

eration of operators at loop level, the reason is seen scale-by-scale, while in our example, the loop

integrand does not vanish and there is no scale-by-scale understanding of the zero. Thus any sym-

metry explanation must be "not Wilsonian" in order to explain the total derivative phenomenon

and the associated cancellation between widely distant scales. Note also that in our simplest ex-

ample, there is a precise cancellation between the contributions from around the scale mS and mL, and so one might be tempted to look for a symmetry exchanging these scales. However, as we

have mentioned, the same zero occurs with any number of insertions on the fermion line, where

The "integrand is a total derivative" phenomenon of this note has been seen in other settings.

A concrete example in the context of a special non-supersymmetric string compactification was

studied long ago in [37], where as a consequence of a hidden "Atkin-Lehner" symmetry­not part

of the usual modular group­the one-loop vacuum energy in a particular two-dimensional, non-

supersymmetric compactification of string theory was seen to vanish. This was soon thereafter

understood as a total derivative phenomenon [38]: the integral over the fundamental domain is

a total derivative, whose boundary contributions happen to vanish in the model. Note that the

symmetry here is not manifest scale-by-scale, and so is "not-Wilsonian" in the sense we mentioned

above. More recently, the total derivative phenomenon (amongst other things) has been discussed in

19
the context of toy integrals illustrating how "UV-IR corrleations" might be relevant for addressing naturalness puzzles [39].
We have now encountered this in a simple physical computation, possibly relevant to the real world, albeit violating naturalness for higher-dimensional (g - 2) operators, rather than relevant operators associated with the Higgs mass and the cosmological constant. While this finding may well just be a curiosity, it encourages a renewed effort to look for an analogous mechanism that might be relevant for addressing these most dramatic apparent failures of naturalness of our times.
