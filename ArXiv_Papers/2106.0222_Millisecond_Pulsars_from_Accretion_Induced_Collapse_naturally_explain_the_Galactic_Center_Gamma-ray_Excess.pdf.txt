Gamma-ray data from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope reveal an unexplained, apparently diffuse, signal from the Galactic bulge. The origin of this "Galactic Center Excess" (GCE) has been debated with proposed sources prominently including self-annihilating dark matter and a hitherto undetected population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We use a binary population synthesis forward model to demonstrate that an MSP population arising from the accretion induced collapse of O-Ne white dwarfs in Galactic bulge binaries can naturally explain the GCE. Synchrotron emission from MSPlaunched cosmic ray electrons and positrons seems also to explain the mysterious "haze" of hardspectrum, non-thermal microwave emission from the inner Galaxy detected in WMAP and Planck data.

I. INTRODUCTION
Data collected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board of NASA's Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope have revealed an excess of extended, apparently diffuse ray emission from the Galactic Center and Galactic bulge [1­4]. This -ray feature, peaking near 2 GeV with an approximately spherical [5] intensity profile  r-2.4 [3, 6], is known as the Galactic Center Excess (GCE). The GCE extends to angular radial scales of at least 10 but possibly to 20 [7, 8].
While the morphology, spectrum, and luminosity of the GCE are broadly consistent with weakly interacting massive particle dark matter annihilation [1], another explanation for the signal is that it is caused by an otherwise-undetected population of -ray millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the Galactic bulge, such a population being anticipated by [9]. Indeed, the spectrum of the GCE resembles not only that of individual -ray MSPs but also that of globular clusters whose integrated -ray emission was predicted, and later confirmed, to arise from large MSP populations [4, 10­12].
One potential discriminant between WIMP DM and MSPs as the origin of the GCE is that, while the former should be characterised by "true" diffuse emission, the latter is, at least partially, expected to generate the GCE via the combined emission from many discrete, but dim and individually-unresolvable MSP sources. In some circumstances, statistical methods of point source inference [13] may distinguish between these two types of emission [14, 15]. Efforts in this direction using a number of different techniques are on-going but have not been

uncontested and there is on-going controversy about the reliability of these studies in the presence of large systematic uncertainties due to foreground model uncertainties [e.g., 16­18].
Finally, four studies [19­22] have now shown that the distribution of the GCE signal traces the stars of the inner Galaxy better than it traces a radially symmetric distribution (as would be expected for dark matter). This constitutes a strong argument for a stellar origin of the GCE that is completely independent of claims and counter-claims concerning the presence of a sub-threshold source contribution.
An argument raised against an MSP origin for the GCE is that the implied -ray luminosity distribution is not consistent with the local, resolved MSP disk population since it predicts too many bright MSPs [23]. This has been disputed [24] but, in any case, the bulge MSP population need not display the same characteristics as that of the local Galactic disk MSP population: star formation ceased  8 - 10 Gyrs ago in the bulge [25, 26] while it is ongoing in the disk. Because MSPs spin down over time and become less -ray luminous ­ with the initially brightest MSPs evolving fastest ­ there is a systematic age difference between bulge and disk MSP populations, so that we expect a relative deficit of bright MSPs in the bulge.
To date, much of the discussion surrounding the tenability of the bulge MSP explanation for the GCE has implicitly adopted the canonical "recycling" scenario for the origin of the MSPs whereby an old and slowly rotating neutron star (NS) formed in a core-collapse supernova accretes material and angular momentum from a com-

2

panion during Low-Mass X-Ray Binary (LMXB) phases [27]. Accretion spins up the NS to millisecond periods thus enabling it to emit detectable  radiation [28]. On this basis, Cholis et al. [29] and Haggard et al. [30] raised another argument against an MSP origin of the GCE: the Galactic bulge should host 103 LMXBs, while observations by the INTEGRAL X-ray telescope have uncovered only 42 LMXBs with an additional 46 candidates within a 10 radius of the Galactic Centre [30].
This argument, however, neglects the existence of a separate channel which may produce 50% of all observed MSPs [31­33], namely, the accretion induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs into neutron stars (NS). Here we concentrate on AIC events that occur when ultra-massive oxygen-neon (O-Ne) white dwarfs, accreting matter from their binary companions, approach the Chandrasekhar mass limit (1.4M ), lose electron degeneracy pressure support due to electron capture on 24Mg and 24Na nuclei [see 34, and references therein], and collapse into NSs [35­37]. Conservation of angular momentum in these events yields spin periods for the nascent NSs (whose radii are three orders of magnitude smaller than the parent WDs) of just a few ms. Similarly, flux conservation during AIC means that progenitor O-Ne WD magnetic fields  103 - 105 G result in field strengths of 107 - 109 G for the newly born NSs, directly matching observations without invoking hypothetical mechanisms for magnetic field decay (crucial in the recycling scenario). Furthermore, because very little mass is lost in the collapse, the binary is not disrupted, nor does the system receive a significant natal kick [38, 39]. This means that NSs born via AIC have much smaller space velocities than those imparted to NSs during the generally asymmetrical explosion of a core collapse supernova [40­42]. Thus, the MSPs born via AIC are more likely to remain trapped in the gravitational potential of the bulge allowing for a large population to build up over its history and proffering an explanation of the match [19­22] between the projected bulge stellar distribution and the detailed GCE morphology.
In this paper we present the results of a binary population synthesis (BPS) forward model for the formation and evolution of the Galactic bulge MSP population born from the AIC of accreting O-Ne WDs to ascertain whether the -ray (and X-ray) phenomenology of this population allows it to explain the GCE.
II. AIC EVOLUTION SCENARIO
O-Ne WDs are generated when stars develop carbonoxygen (CO) cores in the range of 1.6 - 2.25 M that ignite carbon under semi-degenerate conditions. A major aspect of binary evolution, crucial to the production of compact binaries [43], is common envelope (CE) evolution which occurs when a star (generally a giant) overfills

its Roche lobe engulfing both stars. A giant star with a convective envelope tends to further expand in response to mass loss, thus triggering unstable mass transfer at rates that are so high that the transferred matter cannot all be captured by the companion. Instead, the matter accumulates in a common envelope surrounding both the giant core and the companion star [44]. Since the envelope rotates more slowly than the stellar orbit, friction causes the stars to spiral together and transfer orbital energy to the envelope. This process may release sufficient energy to shed the entire envelope, leaving either a close binary containing a WD and its companion star, or a coalescence of the giant's core with the companion star (see Appendix S2).
In an AIC, while the rotational angular momentum of the collapsing O-Ne WD is largely retained, there is some angular momentum loss to gravitational wave (GW) radiation induced by the rapidly changing quadrupole moment characterising the matter distribution. Although an AIC event imparts a negligible kick [e.g. 38], some baryonic mass is suddenly lost, causing a drop in the effective gravitational mass and an expansion of the binary. Depending on system parameters, the stars may come into contact again and mass transfer resume. We find that donor stars can transfer more than 0.1M of material to the NS and thus post-AIC accretion is a very important determinant of the spin evolution of the AIC MSP population. Given the -ray luminosity of a NS is powered by its rotational kinetic energy, our modelling includes all accretion torques acting on the NS following its formation (see Appendix S4).
III. GENERATION OF REFERENCE DATA SET
To evolve a model population of binaries up to AIC, we have used the state-of-the-art binary-star evolution (BSE) code [45­47]. BSE takes as input stellar zero age main sequence (ZAMS) masses, M1,ZAMS and M2,ZAMS for the primary and secondary respectively (where M1,ZAMS  M2,ZAMS), and the initial binary separation, a. We adopt the following empirically-motivated, "off-the-shelf" parameter choices (see Appendix S1 A for detailed justifications and motivations): i) We assume a binary star fraction of 70% [33]; ii) We draw M1,ZAMS from the initial mass function of [48] iii) Secondary masses are drawn from a flat mass ratio distribution [46, 49]; iv) Initial eccentricities are set to zero; v) Orbital periods at zero age are drawn from a log-uniform distribution and range from 10 days to 104 days [50]; vi) The common envelope efficiency factor (see Appendix S2) is set to CE = 1 [33]; vii) The binding energy parameter b is calculated using the Cambridge STARS code [51­ 53]; and viii) Magnetic fields are assigned to each nascent AIC NS via random sampling from the log-normal magnetic field distribution of [24]. Our synthetic population

3

consists of 6.3 × 107 binary systems which, given the parameters above, would be hosted by an overall stellar population of 2.0 × 109M ZAMS mass.
We numerically evolve the binaries up to 14 Gyrs generating a total of 9.1 × 103 AIC events, which start when the population is only 0.2 Gyr old (Figure 1). In the present study we have neglected Merger-Induced Collapse (MIC) events that occur when two massive WDs merge due to gravitational wave radiation [54]. This is because they occur relatively early post star-formation [33, 55], supply less than 10% of the MSP population [33], and, in any case, produce nascent NSs with superstrong magnetic fields [e.g. 56] that quickly spin down and no longer qualify as MSPs today.
IV. APPLICATION TO THE GALACTIC BULGE
In order to apply our model results to the Galactic bulge, we need to scale up from the 2.0 × 109 M ZAMS equivalent stellar mass (whose binary population we have modeled) to the bulge ZAMS mass. The latter quantity can be inferred from its current measured [57] stellar mass (1.55±0.15)×1010M (including stellar remnants), its star formation history (with the overwhelming majority of stars formed more than 8 Gyr ago [25, 26]), and a model for the mass loss by stars in winds and ejecta over the course of their evolution [58]. The current bulge stellar mass needs to scaled upwards by 1.81±0.02 to obtain the ZAMS mass [59], leading to an overall rescaling from the ZAMS mass implied by the binary population we have modeled to the bulge of 14.0 ± 4.1. This implies (1.3 ± 0.4) × 105 AIC events have occurred in the bulge up to the present (cf. Figure 1) and, in the present epoch, (1.1±0.3)×105 MSPs in the bulge, and an AIC expected every few Myr.
A. Predicted Bulge MSP -ray emission
Empirically, 10% of the kinetic energy of rotation of an MSP is lost to dipole radiation [60] which emerges at -ray wavelengths due to "prompt" emission by e+ - e- pairs within the magnetosphere. A further, poorlydetermined fraction (1 ­ 90%: [61, 62]), is carried away in relativistic pairs that escape the magnetosphere and, after possible re-acceleration at pulsar wind termination or intra-binary shocks, generates additional synchrotron and -ray inverse Compton (IC) signals on interstellar medium (ISM) fields. Ultimately, both prompt and delayed signals are powered by the liberation, via magnetic dipole braking, of the rotational kinetic energy of the MSP population. In Figure 2 we show the evolution of this spin down power ­ which thus sets an upper limit on the total (i.e., prompt + IC) -ray luminosity of the

mean distance (as obtained from Monte Carlo sampling of the spatial model [24]) to each MSP of dMSP = 7.89 kpc).

We next wish to determine the spectrum at Earth of the -ray emission due to our model bulge MSP population. Given that our BPS gives us the instantaneous period and period derivative of each MSP, we use an empirical prompt -ray luminosity model of the form [63]:
L,prompt,i = f,prompt (Pi/s) PMB,i erg s-1, (1)
where Pi is the current period of the ith MSP and PMB,i is the time derivative of its period due to magnetic dipole braking. This luminosity is distributed over a spectrum

The dot-dash blue line shows the central value of the spectrum directly-predicted by our BPS model; all solid lines have been fitted following the procedure outlined in Appendix S6 (bands indicate ±1 error). The spectral index of the IC-emitting
CR e± population is e = -2.1+-00..12 and its cutoff energy is (9+-120) × 1011 eV.

From Figure 3 it is evident that the predicted prompt spectrum at Earth is promisingly similar to that measured and, in particular, does a good job of reproducing the 2 GeV bump). On the other hand, i) the amplitude of the central value of the predicted signal is somewhat low and ii) the spectral shape is not a good fit to the tail at high energies (E 10 GeV)[64]. However, there is a potential further source of -ray emission powered by the MSP spin down that could contribute to the observed GCE signal, in particular, the high-energy tail: IC off photons of the interstellar radiation field by e± that escape MSP magnetospheres (e.g. [6, 62, 65­70]). This process can supply spectrally hard emission up to
30 GeV, as required (e.g., [62]). Moreover, our -ray template analysis reveals that the GCE signal is smeared out over a vertical angular scale of  5, an observation that strongly suggests that IC emission significantly contributes to it (see Appendix S7 B).

dN dE

Now, while the total prompt emission is prescribed (up to statistical fluctuations) once we have the {Pi, PMB,i} from our model MSP population, this is not the case for the delayed IC signal which is subject to a number of factors not determined within out model (see Appendix S7). On the other hand, the IC and IC + prompt signals are subject to two significant constraints: i) synchrotron radiation off the bulge magnetic field by the population of CR e± escaping MSP magnetospheres (and also supplying the IC signal) should not exceed the measured, microwave frequency flux density emitted from the inner Galaxy [71] and ii) the overall prompt + IC + synchrotron luminosity may not exceed the total power liberated by magnetic braking of the MSP population.
Using these constraints, we perform a simultaneous fitting of the IC and prompt signals to the GCE data points allowing the amplitude of the prompt signal to float within its uncertainty range; the fitted spectra and their uncertainty bands are shown in Figure 3. Evidently, an old population of MSPs can reproduce very well the measured -ray emission from the GCE. Turning to Figure 4 which shows the broad-band, non-thermal emission from our fit, note that we also saturate (by construction) the microwave data points [71] that describe the spectrum of the "microwave haze", an enduringly mysterious, non-thermal (total) emission feature of the inner Galaxy first discovered in WMAP data [72] and for which a number of previous works have considered a potential origin in inner Galaxy pulsars or MSPs [73­77]. Also note that our fit here requires that a significant fraction, close to 100%, of the spin-down power liberated by magnetic braking ends up in relativistic pairs (cf.[61]).

B. Predicted population of bright, -ray resolvable Bulge MSPs
In Figure 5 (top) we show the absolute (energy) flux FE distribution of our model bulge AIC MSP population at 13.8 Gyr. The middle panel shows a zoom-in, close to the detection threshold (corresponding to 0 on the xaxis), of the histogrammed distribution of the ratios of each MSP's prompt flux to the flux required for likely detection, either as a -ray point source (Fsens,point) or (more stringently) as an individual MSP (Fsens,MSP), at the MSP's modelled position; see Appendix S10. Clearly very few MSPs are likely to be individually detected. Note that most of the IC-emitting CR e± launched by each MSP will be transported outside the aperture [78] defined by the Fermi-LAT point spread function before IC radiating (cf. Figure S19), so the IC flux contributed by each MSP does not contribute to its point source flux. Considering only prompt emission, we determine a mean number of Bulge MSPs expected to be detected by Fermi of 0.1500..307[79]. The photon number flux distribution of the population is shown in the bottom panel of Figure 5. We discuss our predictions for the flux distribution of the putative MSP population in the context of results obtained using point source inference techniques in Appendix S11.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We have evolved a model population of Galactic bulge binaries to the present day; these generate 1.3 × 105 accretion induced collapse (AIC) neutron stars whose present-day spin periods (< 40 ms) qualify them as MSPs. Individually, these MSPs cannot be distinguished from those that form via "recycling" of old NSs born from core collapse supernovae. At a population level, bulge MSPs are older and thus dimmer than typical local MSPs belonging to the Galactic disk population and characterised by a luminosity distribution 1031±3 erg/s including both prompt and IC components (and taking the mean and standard deviation in the log). The model bulge AIC MSP population can fully explain both the spectrum and overall luminosity of the GCE and, as a bonus, the microwave haze from the inner Galaxy. We find that the synthetic MSP population also reproduces the correct spectral shape of the GCE yet does not predict too many bright and resolvable -ray MSPs; we show in Appendix S12 that, in addition, our model does not predict too many bright, individual X-ray sources nor an excessive integrated X-ray luminosity.
The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will look at the sky in photons with energies ranging from 20 GeV to 300 TeV and is expected to spend at least 500 hours observing the inner Galaxy [80] in which case we expect its point source sensitivity at 0.1 TeV to approach

Note
that the population contains no MSPs with FE 10-11 erg/s/cm2 or F 10-10 ph/s/cm2

few ×10-13 erg cm-2 s-1 [81]. Thus, CTA should resolve at least a handful of GCE MSPs according to the best-fit spectral parameters reported above (cf. [70]). In addition, we expect point source inference techniques directed at inferring the flux distribution of the sub-threshold population in Fermi-LAT data [e.g. 82] will, as they reach maturity and become robust to systematics, start to test our MSP population predictions.

S1. BINARY-STAR EVOLUTION (BSE) CODE
The BSE algorithm presented by Hurley et al. [46], with updates as described by Kiel and Hurley [85] is a state-ofthe-art rapid evolution algorithm that melds single star evolution [45, 46] with binary evolution. BSE evolves binary stellar components through detached, semidetached, or contact phases of binary evolution. During the evolution of a binary system, eccentricity may evolve, and, owing to tidal interactions (which are modeled in detail within BSE), synchronization of stellar rotation with the orbital motion may occur. BSE includes all orbital angular momentum loss mechanisms including gravitational radiation and mass loss. Wind accretion (wherein the secondary accretes some of the material lost from the primary in a wind), and Roche lobe overflow (where mass transfer occurs if either star fills its Roche lobe), are modelled on nuclear, thermal, or dynamical time-scales ­ whichever is smallest. BSE dynamically adjusts orbital parameters while taking into consideration any mass variation in the two stars. Stars with deep surface convection zones and degenerate stars are unstable to dynamical time-scale mass loss unless the mass ratio of the system is less than some critical value. The outcome is a common-envelope event [43]. This results in either the merging of the two stars, likely accompanied by the generation of a very strong magnetic field [e.g. 56, 86], or the formation of a close binary. Conversely, mass transfer on a nuclear or thermal time-scale is assumed to be a steady process. Prescriptions to determine the type and rate of mass transfer, the response of the secondary to accretion, and the outcome of any merger events are in place in BSE; details can be found in Hurley et al. [45, 46, 47].

A. Choice of initial binary parameters
Secondary masses: It is standard practice in numerical binary population synthesis calculations and supported by observations of binary systems in the Galaxy [87, 88], that companion secondary masses be described by a flat distribution relative to primary masses: 0 < q = M2,ZAMS/M1,ZAMS < 1.
Initial eccentricity: In our BPS we initialise all binaries with circular orbits, a standard approach in BPS [e.g. 32, 89] and, for low and intermediate-mass stars, a tolerably accurate description of reality [90], especially in light of the fact that mass transfer and tides in interacting systems ­ the progenitor of AICs ­ quickly bring them to zero eccentricity. In any case, this assumption implies an error significantly smaller than those accruing from mass determination uncertainty: see the discussion in [33], section 4.1, and Appendix S9 below.

S2. COMMON ENVELOPE TREATMENT

BSE's CE evolution follows closely the description of Tout et al. [91] where the outcome depends on the initial binding energy, Ebind, of the envelope and the initial orbital energy, Eorb, of the two cores. A structure parameter  (also called the envelope binding energy factor) is introduced so that the binding energy of the envelope of a star of mass M , degenerate core mass Mc and radius R is [92]

Ebind

=

GM (M - R

Mc) ,

where G is the gravitational constant. Because the ejection of the envelope may not be complete, an efficiency factor, CE, is introduced. Thus

Eorb = CE Ebind

gives the fraction of the orbital energy that is transferred to the envelope. Most CE evolution models use CE = 1 [89, 93] and this is the value that we also use in our modeling. However,
there is a lot of uncertainty in this value [e.g. 94] due to the CE evolutionary phase being poorly understood, mostly because it happens on dynamical time scales and therefore there are no observations that can be used to constrain the physical parameters that dominate the CE evolution. The parameter  is of the order of unity and depends on

S3
the stellar density distribution. We have used the BSE prescription for  calculated with the Cambridge STARS code [51, 52] and assumed that half of the envelope's internal energy aids its ejection. This setup is very similar to "Model 2" of Ruiter et al. [33].
A. Stellar types and a typical evolutionary pathway towards AIC
We use the stellar types (k) correspond to the evolutionary phase designated by Hurley et al. [45], which are:
0  Main Sequence (MS) M  0.7M 1  MS star M > 0.7M 2  Hertzsprung gap (HG) 3  Red Giant Branch (RG) 4  Core Helium Burning (CHeB) 5  Early Asymptotic Giant Branch (EAGB) 6  Thermally Pulsing AGB (TPAGB) 7  Helium Main Sequence (HeMS) 8  Helium Hertzsprung gap (HeHG) 9  Helium Giant Branch (HeGB) 10  Helium White Dwarf (He WD) 11  Carbon/Oxygen White Dwarf (CO WD) 12  Oxygen/Neon White Dwarf (O-Ne WD) 13  Neutron Star (NS) 14  Black Hole (BH) 15  Massless remnant (after SN Ia explosion)
1. A typical evolutionary pathway towards AIC
(The reader is referred to Figure S6). The primary's ZAMS mass is 7.636 M and its radius at t = 0 is 3.364 R . The secondary has a ZAMS mass of 5.702 M and a radius of 2.841 R . The initial separation at the time of the system's birth is 2369.2 R . The primary evolves through HG, First Giant Branch, CHeB, EAGB and HeGB phases before becoming a O-Ne WD.
The first interaction occurs at 44 Myr after starburst. Initially, the ZAMS primary undergoes Roche Lobe Overflow (RLOF) as it expands on the main sequence and the main sequence secondary accretes matter stably. At 54 Myrs from birth, the primary evolves through the Hertzsprung gap and then along the asymptotic giant branch, all the while donating mass to the MS secondary. This is followed by a common envelope (CE) phase between the late AGB primary (6.859 M ) and the main sequence companion (5.434 M ). The CE phase causes the binary orbit to shrink and the primary moves from the EAGB to become a Giant Branch Naked Helium star and soon evolves into a O-Ne WD.
The next interaction does not occur until there is stable RLOF (which begins at time t83 Myrs) between the Hertzsprung Gap secondary (5.969 M ) and the O-Ne WD (1.315 M ). The primary continues accreting mass for another 20 Myrs (t = 103 Myrs) until the secondary (now a Hertzsprung Gap Naked Helium star) collapses into a CO WD (0.683 M ). The system remains dormant till t = 108.4 Myrs, while spiraling closer (a = 0.194R ) via gravitational radiation. The dormant phase is followed by the O-Ne WD accreting mass from the CO WD for 0.3 Myrs. Once the O-Ne WD (1.439M ,5.3×103 s) approaches the Chandrasekhar limit for rotationally supported WDs, it undergoes AIC to form a NS (1.357 M , P = 4.8 ms) at t = 109 Myrs from birth. After it is formed, magnetic dipole braking is the dominant spin-down mechanism for the NS for 105 yrs, and soon after that, the NS begins accreting mass from the CO WD (0.109 M ).
Figure S7 shows the number of systems that undergo an AIC event in our simulated population and their corresponding companion stellar types. Each line represents an AIC event. Regions of solid colour are regions of high number density of systems with respective donor types that undergo an AIC event at any point in the age of the Bulge. Systems with CO WD, He WD and He-MS donors dominate the AIC progenitor population. We also observe

The angular momentum loss due to gravitational radiation is accounted for following Watts and Andersson [95]. The total stellar angular momentum J is the sum of the star's angular momentum J and the canonical angular momentum of the r-mode Jc [95]:

32J~M R2

Jc = -

(S5)

where, for an n = 1 polytrope, J~ = 1.635 × 10-2 and  is the mode amplitude [96]. The total torque on the star J can therefore be written as

J = I + I + Jc.

(S6)

Here,  is the star's angular velocity. I = I~M R2 is the moment of inertia of the star. Because the star is modelled as an n = 1 polytrope, then I~ = 0.261. For this work, we only account for radiation from the dominant l = m = 2
current multipole of the r-mode. Following [95], we assume that the canonical angular momentum evolves as

S4. SPIN EVOLUTION OF NEUTRON STARS POST AIC
In this section we outline our modelling procedure to compute the spin evolution of post-AIC NSs in the nonaccretion and accretion phases.

A. Non accreting neutron stars

If there is no accretion onto the NS, this spins down via magnetic dipole radiation [e.g., 97],

PMB

P s

(S13)

where P is the NS rotation period, µ30 is its magnetic moment (µ = BRN3 S) in units of 1030 G cm3 and I45 is the NS's moment of inertia (I 2/5MNSRN2 S) in units of 1045 g cm2. We take into account the effects of dipole braking only on the spin evolution of non-accreting pulsars, whereas, in the case of accreting NSs in binaries, we also include
the torques applied by the in-falling matter on the NS.

B. Accreting neutron stars

Accreting NSs are called low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). In these systems the companion star overfills its Roche lobe and matter escapes through the inner Lagrange point and flows toward the NS's magnetosphere. Because this matter has a large specific angular momentum, it cannot impact directly on to the surface of the NS but instead forms an accretion disk. Over time, matter in the accretion disk drifts gradually inwards as angular momentum is transferred outwards by viscous torques. Once the material reaches the magnetospheric radius rm where the magnetic pressure dominates over the gas ram pressure [98],

µ4

1/7

rm =  2GM M 2

,

(S14)

the gas is magnetically channelled along magnetic fields lines to impact near the magnetic poles of the NS. Here

0.5    1.4 depends on the fraction of the star's magnetic flux threading the disk. [98]; in our work we adopt

 = 0.5 [99].

At the magnetospheric boundary, the coupling between the field lines and the disk results in a torque acting on the

NS that can spin it up or down depending on whether rm is larger or smaller than the co-rotation radius rc given by

GM 1/3

rc = 2

.

(S15)

At rc matter rotates with an angular velocity equal to the spin angular velocity  = 2/P of the NS. Thus, there are two possible cases that need to be considered [98, 100­103], namely:

1. If rm < rc, the standard torque (neglecting magnetic field effects, such as distortion and/or pinching of the

magnetic field lines at the threading region) is [102]

where K (rm) is the Keplerian angular velocity at rm and I is the moment of inertia of the NS. The disk-star system is thus regarded as an accretor. Here the gas channelled on to the NS has greater specific angular momentum than the NS and thus the star is spun up.

2. When the accretion disk is truncated at a radius larger than the co-rotation radius (rm > rc), the disk-star system is regarded as a "propeller". In this phase, the sign of (1 - s) dictates whether the NS accretes the gas and spins up (the "slow rotator" regime, s < 1) or ejects the gas and spins down (the "fast rotator" regime, s > 1 [99]). The quantity s is the fastness parameter, defined as the ratio of the spin frequency of the NS () to the Keplerian orbital frequency (K(rm)) at the magnetospheric boundary:

 s = K (rm) .

C. Spin period evolution of bulge MSP population
In this section we analyse the effects of the different spin evolution processes described above. We show in Figure S8 the impact that turning off accretion after NS formation has on the spin period evolution of a binary. We find that, while accretion effects may cause some initial enhancement in the -ray emission post AIC, in the long term they actually keep the MSP somewhat dimmer than if no post-AIC accretion occurs.
We show in Figure S9 the histograms of the total changes in rotational kinetic energy caused by the various processes outlined in Section S4 up to the end of our 14 Gyr simulation for all model AIC MSPs. Note that some systems are considerably spun up by accretion and that gravitational wave energy losses at the time of AIC are always small in comparison with all other processes (which act over multi-Gyr timescales).

S6. INITIAL CALCULATION OF MODEL MSP POPULATION PROMPT FLUX Our aim is to determine the -ray spectrum received at the Earth due to our model population of bulge MSPs to assess whether this is compatible with the observed GCE. In our BPS modeling we evolve the spin period of a population of AIC NSs over cosmological timescales. The (time dependent) masses of these NSs are also determined within the model. The magnetic field strength of each NS is chosen by sampling from the magnetic field distribution recently determined by Ploeg et al. [24]. This, in turn, allows us to determine the period derivative attributable to magnetic dipole braking, PMB. With P and PMB determined for each NS, we can calculate the instantaneous

spin-down power liberated by magnetic braking as:

(S18)

note here that E MB(t) corresponds to the blue band in Figure 2.

Next, to determine the prompt luminosity of each model MSP and the resulting total prompt signal, we apply

equation 1 together with measurements of the numerical coefficients obtained by [24] in a combined statistical analysis

of data for nearby, resolved -ray MSPs and the GCE signal. Specifically, we draw log10(f,prompt) from a normal distribution with mean 41.4 and standard deviation 0.6 and we set  = -1.9 and  = 0.69. We then assume the
following spectral form for the prompt -ray spectrum of the ith MSP [24]:

(S20)

In equation S19 Ecut,i and i are assigned to each MSP by drawing from normal distributions with mean and
standard deviation determined by [24]. Specifically, log10(Ecut/MeV) and  are drawn from a bivariate normal distribution with a spin-down power-dependent mean and a correlation coefficient. The distribution of log10(Ecut) has a mean at aEcut log10(E /(1034.5 erg s-1)) + bEcut and a standard deviation Ecut . For , the mean is at a log10(E /(1034.5 erg s-1))+b and the standard deviation is . Here we use aEcut = 0.23, bEcut = 2.99, Ecut = 0.22, a = 0.48, b = 0.99,  = 0.32 with a correlation coefficient between  and Ecut given by r,Ecut = 0.73. These parameters were the highest likelihood parameters in Ploeg et al. [24] for a randomly selected Markov chain (see their

model A6). The functional form for the prompt luminosity is that of Gonthier et al. [63]. The error in the prompt

flux estimation arising from the uncertainties in these parameters is discussed in Appendix S9.

With the prompt luminosity and the spectral distribution of the prompt emission of each MSP determined, we

then assign, as described by [24], a distance to each MSP di by Monte Carlo sampling from a detailed spatial
model of the "Boxy Bulge" [21, 104]. The weighted mean distance that we obtain with this procedure is dMSP  iLijd2j /Lj 1/2 = 7.89 kpc [105]. Furthermore, once we have assigned a 3D position to each MSP, we can also derive their Galactic longitudes and latitudes which are required because the flux sensitivity of Fermi-LAT is dependent on

pointing direction (see Section S10).

To recapitulate: We compute the prompt spectral luminosity of each MSP via equation 1 and solve for F,prompt,i,
thence Ki, to obtain the prompt differential flux (equation S19) for each MSP. The predicted, current-day synthetic flux density (E2-weighted) is acquired by adding the contribution from all MSPs and is shown as the solid blue line in Figure S13 together with the observed spectrum of the GCE [21].

S7. DETERMINING INVERSE COMPTON AND TOTAL SPECTRA
Unfortunately, unlike the case presented by the prompt emission, the amplitude and spectrum of the delayed IC emission from each MSP is subject to many uncertainties. These include the efficiency with which magnetosphereescaping e± are reaccelerated at MSP wind shocks and/or intra-binary shocks formed between the pulsar wind and a close companion's stellar wind, and the relative energy densities of ISM magnetic field and radiation field (according to which e± energy losses are apportioned into either synchrotron or IC radiation). On the other hand, this signal is significantly constrained (as explained below) and we may therefore estimate it using a fitting procedure. Physically, our model of the IC component assumes emission from a power-law cosmic ray e± population, with an exponential cut-off, IC-scattering a photon population representative [106] of the inner Galaxy. The normalisation, spectral index, and cut-off energy of the overall e± population are variables in the fit.

A. Initial spectrum determination
Given the (preliminary) prompt spectrum is now prescribed up to some error (see Appendix S9), our first approach to determining the IC spectrum is simply to find the residuals obtained from subtracting the prompt from the measured spectral data points, then fit these residuals via an IC emission model; cf. Figure S13.

S11
The normalisation, spectral index, and cut-off energy of the overall e± population are variables in the fit; for the latter two we find best-fit values via this exercise of e = -2.9+-00..34 and log10(Ee,cut/eV) = 12.1+-10..31. Here the error ranges are given by the best-fits to the residuals defined by adopting extremal values of the prompt flux, i.e., the top and bottom of the blue error band on the prompt spectrum displayed in Figure S13. These fit values are physically plausible and thus entirely consistent with a putative MSP origin of the IC-emitting e± (e.g.,[107]). Fractionally, the overall luminosity (> 0.1 GeV) is 0.46-+00..2169 due to prompt emission and the total -ray luminosity is 2.3+-31..11×1037 erg/s (cf. the spin-down power liberated by magnetic dipole braking at 13.8 Gyr according to our BPS of 5.8 ± 0.6 × 1037 erg/s) and, formally, we have found a statistically acceptable fit with 2/dof = 5.1/(15 - 3) = 0.43.

B. Constraints on IC and total -ray emission
Despite achieving a good fit, we note that we should consider and exploit, where warranted, a number of physical constraints on the fitted IC and total -ray emission that we have, thus far, ignored. The implications of these, both singularly and in combination, we now assess in turn. They will help inform the final spectral decomposition between prompt and IC emission that we present in the main paper in Figure 3.
Firstly, energy conservation requires that the luminosity of the combined prompt and IC signals be less than the spin-down power liberated by magnetic braking. Given the numbers quoted above and with reference to Figure 2, it is clear that there is sufficient magnetic braking power to energise the total -ray spectrum, although we come interestingly close in the best-fit parameter region to saturating this (cf. [61]).
Secondly, IC -rays at 1 GeV are up-scattered from the dominant  1.5 eV ISRF of the bulge by parent  13 GeV CR e±'s. It is unavoidable that such pairs will synchrotron radiate on the bulge magnetic field. This has two

S12

important consequences: i) the synchrotron luminosity of the model bulge MSP population must also be accounted for in the overall energetics and ii) we must assess whether the predicted synchrotron emission obeys empirical constraints derived from microwave frequency observations of the bulge (see below).
Thirdly, whilst one might seek to evade these synchrotron constraints by dialing down the bulge magnetic field amplitude (which we now treat as a free parameter to be determined), this strategy does not work because i) there is an empirical lower limit on the magnetic field amplitude of  9 µG in this region [108] and ii) the IC signal would then become too smeared out. In more detail about the latter: because the putative IC-radiating secondary CR e± pairs are launched into the ISM, this introduces the possibility that, unlike the prompt signal which emerges from the magnetospheres of individual MSPs, the delayed signal is smeared out over some angular scale corresponding to the distance over which the pairs are transported during their energy-loss timescale. We show the equivalent one-dimensional smearing angular scale for CR e± IC-radiating at 1 GeV (and losing energy via their synchrotron and IC emission) as a function of bulge magnetic field in Figure S14. These curves have been evaluated for a bulge ISRF energy density of  2 eV cm-3[106]. The different colors illustrate the results obtained for different assumptions about the transport of radiating pairs in the bulge.

FIG. S14: Expected angular transport scales vs. magnetic field amplitude for CR e± IC-radiating 1 GeV -rays off the ISRF of the bulge where UISRF,bulge = 2 eV cm-3[106]. The blue curves are for advective transport at 500 km/s nuclear wind, the yellow for
diffusive transport with: i) a CR diffusion similar to that in plane of the Galaxy [109]) and ii) suppressed by 0.01 with respect to this
value; and green lines are for transport at the Alfvén speed (i.e., for streaming along the field lines of the bulge magnetic field). The horizontal line at 0.5 shows the 68% angular containment radius of the Fermi-LAT at 1 GeV and the one at 5 indicates the preferred
smearing scale derived from our template analysis (cf. Figure S16). The vertical dashed line indicates the lower limit on the magnetic
field amplitude in this region of the Galaxy established in [108].

These results can be compared with an empirical determination of the smearing scale we have made via template analysis of the Fermi-LAT bulge data and present in Figure S15 and S16. We determined the smearing scale of the boxy bulge template ­used to describe the GCE signal for |b| 0.5 in Refs. [21, 110] ­ by constructing a likelihood profile with blurred versions of the original boxy bulge stellar density map. In particular, we applied both a 2D and a 1D (in the latitude direction) blurring of the projected boxy bulge map using a Gaussian filter with different angular scales. Although this approach of applying the Gaussian filter in 2D on the sky plane ignores the variation (over the line of sight through the bulge) of the lineal distance corresponding to a given angle, it provides a reasonable estimate of the range of deviations from the boxy bulge morphology that are allowed by the GCE data.
The template regression applied here is the same as that introduced in Refs. [21, 110]. In summary, we performed a bin-by-bin fitting procedure in which the likelihood function was maximized at each energy bin independently. To obtain the band fluxes for each template, we used a power law with a fixed slope of -2 and simultaneously varied

S13

the normalization of all the templates in each different energy bin. A description of all the astrophysical templates included in our bin-by-bin analysis is presented in Tab. I of Ref. [110]. The total log-likelihood for a given model is obtained by summing the log-likelihoods of all the energy bins. Figure S15 and S16 show the log-likelihood ratio defined as  log(L) = log(LBB) - log(Lblurred BB), where LBB is the total log-likelihood of the model containing the original boxy bulge template, and Lblurred BB is the total log-likelihood of the model containing the blurred boxy bulge.
Fascinatingly, Figure S15 and S16 demonstrate that, while there is evidence against a 2D smearing of the -ray signal ­ as would be expected, e.g., in the case of isotropic diffusion of the CR pairs or in the case that the putative astrophysical -ray sources receive isotropic kicks at the time of formation[111] ­ there is mild evidence for a finite (1D) smearing in the direction perpendicular to the Galactic plane. In fact, we find a best fit 1D smearing angular scale of  5 degrees, around 700 pc at the bulge distance; the improvement in the overall test statistic at this angle corresponds to a statistical confidence level of 3.3  (corresponding to a 2 log(L) = 27.4 for 15 degrees of freedom). The tentative detection of this smearing constitutes corroborating evidence in support of a large IC contribution to the detected GCE -rays. A vertical smearing is consistent with advection in a nuclear wind ­ for which there is plenty

of independent, multi-wavelength evidence [108, 112, 113] ­ and/or streaming of the CR pairs at the ion Alfvén speed in the rarefied bulge ISM along a predominantly poloidal magnetic field, for which there is also independent evidence (at least for the region quite close to the nucleus; [114]). Given the measured smearing scale, the scenario of advection in a nuclear outflow with a characteristic speed of a few 100 km/s requires a magnetic field amplitude of  20 µG; the same magnetic field amplitude works for (vertical) streaming. The correct smearing scale can also apparently be achieved for a weak field,  1 - 2 µG, either in the case of energy-dependent (and necessarily highly-anisotropic given the smearing is 1D) diffusion governed by a coefficient similar to that measured globally in the Milky Way ­ or, again for vertical streaming at the ion Alfvén speed. However, we show below in our multi-parameter, broadband fitting, that such a low magnetic field amplitude scenario is disfavoured. In any case, combined analyses of broadband, non-thermal data covering the inner Galaxy establish that the magnetic field on the angular scale of the Galactic

S8. BROADBAND MODELING
To gain further insights and to account mathematically for the constraints described above, we now perform a classical 2 analysis wherein we allow the normalization of the prompt spectrum to float (keeping the spectral shape fixed) in addition to the normalization, spectral index, and cut-off energy of the IC-emitting CR e± spectrum. Where required, we also introduce a floating bulge magnetic field amplitude.
In our baseline model, we consider the GCE -ray data points but also introduce a single additional datum that penalizes the 2 for renormalization of the prompt signal amplitude away from the central value we have already calculated. From this we find a minimum 2/dof of 0.4 and a 1 range for the prompt rescaling of  0.3 - 1.9; cf. Figure S17. Note that this preliminary fit does not require either that the implied synchrotron flux (for the minimum empirically acceptable magnetic field of 9 µG) obey the empirical upper limits that emerge from microwave observations [71] nor that the implied total luminosity be less than the spin down power determined from our BPS. We find, indeed, that over much of the range of the rescaling parameter within the 1 confidence region determined above one or both of these constraints is violated.

A. MSP contribution to the Microwave Haze
Consider the broadband spectral energy distribution predicted for the best-fit parameters obtained in the preliminary fitting described above: see Figure S18. What is tantalising about this figure is that while the predicted synchrotron radiation is clearly somewhat in excess of the microwave data measured with the Planck satellite [71], it is nevertheless rather similar in amplitude. These data points describe the spectrum of the Microwave Haze [72]. The haze apparently extends up to somewhat larger angular scales ( 35) than the bulge and a morphological correspondence between it and the even more extended ( 55) Fermi Bubbles has been claimed (e.g., [71]). On the other hand, in its lower reaches the Haze is certainly coincident with the bulge and, as discussed above, transport effects should carry microwave-emitting CR e± over an angular scale of  5 - 10 after they are launched by bulge MSPs that are themselves distributed out to  20 (cf. Figure S19). It is also, of course, possible that more than one processes or population contributes CR e± that generate the Haze. In any case, motivated by these considerations, we perform a new 2 analysis wherein we introduce the magnetic field amplitude as a further tunable parameter, and we fit the combination of the Haze microwave data, the GCE -ray data, a datum for the prompt emission rescaling factor, and a datum which penalizes the 2 for the difference between the total luminosity and the total spin-down power from magnetic braking at 13.8 Gyr according to our BPS (1.0 ± 0.1 × 1038 erg/s). In other words, we assume here that radiative processes saturate the spin-down power (cf. [61]). The results from this are shown in Figure S20 and subsequent figures. Not unexpectedly, the region of good fit is now somewhat more constrained to the region  0.8 - 1.7. The broadband spectral energy distribution obtained for the new best-fit parameters is shown in the main text as Figure 4. Three other quantities of interest ­ the spectral index of the model CR e± population, the amplitude of the perpendicular component of the bulge magnetic field, and the fraction of spin-down power liberated by magnetic braking that is radiated in non-thermal emission ­ are shown as functions of the rescaling in Figure S21, Figure S22, and Figure S23. These figures demonstrate the overall self-consistency of a scenario that invokes a combination of both IC and prompt emission from MSPs as an explanation of the GCE while the CR e± launched into the ISM by the MSPs and requisite to explain the observed IC emission also explain the observed microwave Haze. Note that the magnetic field amplitude close to the best-fit region is, self-consistently, that implied by the observed smearing scale. One question hanging over this analysis concerns the very hard spectral index,  -2.1 - 2.2 of the steady state CR e± (required to simultaneously explain haze and GCE). For reasonable transport and ISM parameters, this population has to largely cool in situ implying, in the case of a power law at injection, an injection spectral index of  1.1 - 1.2. Alternatively, a monochromatic or highly peaked injection spectrum would also work. Neither of these is excluded by current research into MSPs (see the discussion in [61]; we leave further consideration

S9. ERROR BUDGET(S)
The two dominant contributions to the total error in rescaling our results (for the number of AIC systems) from our BPS modeling of  6.3 × 107 binary systems (equivalent host stellar mass of 2.0 × 109M ) to the Galactic bulge are due to i) the uncertainty in the current stellar mass of the bulge and ii) the uncertainty in the bulge binarity fraction. For the former, Portail et al. [57] state that the bulge stellar mass is (1.4 - 1.7) × 1010M which we treat as (1.55 ± 0.15) × 1010M (1). For the latter, if we allow that the bulge binarity fraction may range over the (likely extremal) range 50 - 100%, then the possible fractional change in ZAMS mass of the parent stellar population relative to our fiducial assumption of 70% binarity fraction is  1.0 ± 0.27. Added in quadrature, the overall fractional error accruing in scaling from the number of binaries we have modeled to that appropriate for bulge stellar population is 1 ± 0.30. Other sources of error arising from systematic uncertainties in accretion physics on the number of AIC events, or the correct parameter choices to describe this or, e.g., assumptions about initial eccentricity distributions are discussed by Ruiter et al. [33], section 4.1; these are small in comparison with the uncertainty accruing from the binarity fraction.
In addition to these two uncertainties, a further significant uncertainty is encountered in assessing the expected prompt -ray luminosity of the model MSP population. This stems from uncertainties in the physical values of the numerical coefficients entering into equation 1 ­f,prompt, ,  ­ which have been estimated on the basis of a combined statistical analysis by Ploeg et al. [24] of local, resolved MSPs and the GCE signal. In order to assess the scale of this uncertainty we generate the distribution of prompt spectra by simulating 1000 bulge populations of

MSPs. For each population we sample at random a parameter set from the Markov chains produced for model A6 in [24] and assign each pulsar a luminosity, spectral index, Ecut depending on the MSP's period and the magnetic dipole braking component of the period derivative. We also simulate a position by sampling from the boxy bulge density model. The simulated spectrum for the prompt emission of each population is then the sum of the MSP spectra within the region of interest. We determine the bin-by-bin means and standard deviations of this collection of MSP population spectra. From this exercise, the flux-weighted fractional error averaged over energy bins is ± 0.43. We add this in quadrature to the errors due to the binarity fraction uncertainty and the present-day bulge stellar mass uncertainty to obtain a total (fractional) prompt -ray luminosity error of ±0.52.

S10. MSP DETECTION PROBABILITY
The Fermi-LAT has a point source flux sensitivity of around F>0.1GeV  10-12 erg cm-2 s-1, but this varies across the sky and it is, in general, more difficult to positively identify a -ray pulsar than a generic -ray point source [60]. We use the Monte Carlo procedure developed by [24] to estimate the flux for each model MSP such that, given its assigned sky position and spectrum, it could be resolved as a -ray point source (Fsens,point) and possibly as an individual MSP (Fsens,MSP)
Following [24] and references therein, we assume that the MSP detection threshold sensitivity flux Fsens is drawn from a log-normal distribution (see eq. 2.34 of [24]). Concerning the threshold sensitivity flux, Fsens,MSP, for detection and positive identification of model MSPs as MSPs we assume that log10(Fsens,MSP) is distributed according to a normal distribution with mean log10(µth) + Kth and standard deviation th. Here µth is the longitude and latitude

dependent Fermi-LAT point source flux detection threshold [116], and Kth = 0.458904 and th = 0.251911 are parameters determined in [24], invariant across the MSP population; Kth accounts for the difficulty inherent in identifying a pulsar as distinct from a -ray point source (so for calculations related to the probability of detecting models MSPs as resolved -ray point sources of undetermined type we set Kth = 0).

S11. MODEL MSP POPULATION (SUB-THRESHOLD) FLUX DISTRIBUTION
There are ongoing efforts, labeled collectively as point source inference [13], to statistically probe the nature of subthreshold and individually-unresolvable point sources putatively contributing to the GCE signal. To date, these efforts have employed a number of different techniques including non-Poissonian template fitting ["NPTF"; 15, 17, 18, 22], wavelet analysis [14], and machine learning methods [82]. All of these techniques at least hint at the existence of a significant sub-threshold source contribution to the GCE. Moreover, some point source inference techniques proffer, at least in principle, the ability not only to evince such sources, but actually to recover their flux distribution, dN/dF . In practice, the results emerging from different groups and/or with different techniques have not yet converged and do not seem to be yet fully robust to systematics [16­18, 117, 118]. In particular, the ability of such techniques to correctly recover the underlying flux distribution of putative GCE sources is affected by our lack of a perfect model of the Galactic foregrounds. Moreover, the statistical reconstruction of a sub-threshold flux distribution must become increasingly unreliable as the zero photon limit is approached because such an "ultra-faint" source population is degenerate with Poissonian emission [18]. The boundary to this region of degeneracy is roughly given by the single photon flux for which only a single photon from a given source is expected over the exposure of the instrument [18]. For Fermi-LAT GCE observations, this corresponds to  10-11 counts cm-2 s-1 (e.g., [18]). This is more-or-less where our model MSP distribution peaks (cf. Figure S25) but given, in particular, that we still predict some brighter sources between the single photon flux and the point-source sensitivity threshold, the flux distribution we predict will be subject to empirical testing via point source inference as these techniques mature. Figure S25 and Figure S26 compare the predictions of our BPS with the results obtained in the pioneering study of [15] and the recent study of [22]. There is apparently some tension here, but note that the results of [15] and [22] are themselves discrepant and, what is more, the level of disagreement between our results and the point source inference results is reduced with

respect to the more recent study. Furthermore, while we clearly predict more power in the distribution in some flux
region than determined by [22], this only occurs for photon fluxes in the problematic regime around and below the single photon limit. Also note that, because our distribution cuts off fairly sharply just above a photon flux of 10-10 cm-2 s-1, while [22] assume a distribution that is continuous to much higher fluxes, these results are not strictly
comparable.

S12. PREDICTED BULGE X-RAY PHENOMENOLOGY

Accreting NSs generate X-ray emission. If this is higher than about 1036 erg/s, these objects could become detectable as X-ray point sources by INTEGRAL [30]. The accretion power (the rate at which kinetic energy is dissipated at the stellar surface) is given by (e.g. [119])

LX

=

 GMaccM acc , Racc

(S21)

where Macc and Racc are the accreting NS mass and radius, respectively, and  is the dimensionless, bolometric correction factor which we determine for each system by randomly sampling from a flat distribution ranging from 0.1
to 0.6. Using equation S21 we find a population of 6.9 × 103 neutron star accretors with about 60 having current
luminosities higher than 1036 erg s-1 (cf. S27). This is entirely consistent with INTEGRAL observations [30] which have uncovered 42 LMXBs and a further 46 LMXB candidates within 10 radius around the Galactic Center.
We also need to establish whether the integrated X-ray emission of the unresolved point sources of our model
is consistent with observations. Thus, we use the observed [120] 2 - 10 keV X-ray luminosity of the Galactic Bulge (6.8±1.2×1037 erg s-1), shown as the data points in Figure S28 at 13.8 Gyrs. To calculate the model X-ray luminosity
shown in the same figure we use moving average smoothing. The integrated X-ray luminosity of our model population
is, for the central value, close to, but below, that measured, which is totally acceptable considering that other X-ray
sources may contribute to the total X-ray luminosity of the Bulge.

S13. TEV HALOS AROUND BULGE MSPS?
An additional argument [121­123] that has been raised against an MSP origin for the GCE is that, on the basis of HAWC data [124] covering a number of local MSPs, one predicts TeV emission in "halos" around the putative MSP population in the inner  0.5 that would be in excess of that detected by the HESS instrument [125]. Formally, because we model here the Boxy Bulge region and not the Nuclear Bulge (the latter being overlapping with the

inner  0.5 field), this constraint does not pertain to our model MSP population. In any case, with Ecut typically evaluating to  TeV in our analyses ­ i.e., with an electron spectrum that cuts off around this energy ­ we do not typically predict strong TeV IC emission from our model MSP population. Moreover, as emphasised in the main text, there are systematic differences between the bulge and local, disk MSP populations. We will return to this issue in a subsequent publication.
