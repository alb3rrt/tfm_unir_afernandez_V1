1. Introduction
Recently, iterated integrals on families of marked elliptic curves were well studied in the study of Feynman integrals (for example, see [19] and references therein) and of (nonabelian) unipotent extensions of elliptic period integrals (cf. [3, 8, 10, 16]). Considering results of of Brown [2] and Banks-Panzer-Pym [1] in the case of marked Riemann surfaces, it is natural to pose a conjecture that these integrals are explicitly described by multiple zeta values and elliptic multiple zeta values which are expressed as iterated integrals of dz/z, dz/(1 - z) and of Eisenstein series respectively.
The aim of this paper is to make a contribution to this conjecture. More precisely, for maximally degenerating families of marked elliptic curves over C, we describe these unipotent periods as computable perturbative expansion in canonical deformation parameters whose coefficients are generated over Q by multiple zeta values and elliptic multiple zeta values. In order to obtain this description, we use formal geometry over Z which provides arithmetic gluing processes of marked Riemann spheres and elliptic curves using Grothendieck's (formal) existence theorem [9, Section 5]. Note that this result be extended for curves of general genus by the theory of the universal Mumford curve given in [12].
In this paper, we first consider the universal marked Tate curve as an arithmetic universal family of marked elliptic curves, and construct the universal KZB connection on this curve by gluing the KZ (Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov) connection and its elliptic extension which are called the KZB (Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard) connection. Therefore, we obtain universal unipotent periods which give isomorphisms between the Betti and de Rham tannakian fundamental groups for degenerating families of marked elliptic curves over C. Then by studying the behavior of these periods under fusing moves on marked Tate curves, we show the main result stated above on the universal unipotent periods which is an extension of results of [2, 1] in the case of genus 0 to that of genus 1.

2. Universal marked Tate curve
2.1. Marked Tate curve. A (marked) curve is called degenerate if it is a stable (marked) curve and the normalization of its irreducible components are all projective (marked) lines. Then the dual graph  = (V, E, T ) of a stable marked curve is a collection of 3 finite sets V of vertices, E of edges, T of tails and 2 boundary maps
b : T  V, b : E - (V  {unordered pairs of elements of V })
such that the geometric realization of  is connected and that  is stable, namely its each vertex has at least 3 branches. Denote by X the number of elements of a finite set X, and call a (connected) stable graph  = (V, E, T ) of (g, n)-type if rankZH1(, Z) = g, T = n. Then under fixing a bijection  : T  {1, ..., n}, which we call a numbering of T ,  = (V, E, T ) becomes the dual graph of a degenerate nmarked curve of genus g such that each tail h  T corresponds to the (h)th marked point. If  is trivalent, i.e. any vertex of  has just 3 branches, then a degenerate T marked curve with dual graph  is maximally degenerate. An orientation of a stable graph  = (V, E, T ) means giving an orientation of each e  E. Under an orientation of , denote by ±E = {e, -e | e  E} the set of oriented edges, and by vh the terminal vertex of h  ±E (resp. the boundary vertex of h  T ). For each h  ±E, denote by let |h|  E be the edge h without orientation.
Let  = (V, E, T ) be a stable graph. Fix an orientation of , and take a subset Ef of ±E  T whose complement E satisfies the condition that
±E  E  {-h | h  E} = ,
and that vh = vh for any distinct h, h  E. We attach variables xh for h  Ef and ye = y-e for e  E which are called moduli parameters and deformation parameters associated with . Let R be the Z-algebra generated by xh (h  Ef ), 1/(xe - x-e) (e, -e  Ef ) and 1/(xh - xh) (h, h  Ef with h = h and vh = vh), and let

A = R[[ye (e  E)]], B = A

where xh (resp. x-h) means  if h (resp. -h) belongs to E. This gives an element of P GL2(B) = GL2(B)/B× denoted by the same symbol which satisfies

We call ,  the attractive, repulsive fixed points of  respectively, and call  the multiplier of .

Theorem 2.1. Let  = (V, E, T ) be a stable graph of (1, n)-type. Then there exists a stable marked curve E of genus 1, called a n-marked Tate curve, over A which satisfies the following properties:

(P1) The closed fiber EA R of E obtained by substituting ye = 0 (e  E) becomes the degenerate marked curve over R with dual graph  which is obtained from the collection of Pv := P1R (v  V ) by identifying the points xe  Pve and x-e  Pv-e (e  E), where xh denotes  if h  E.
(P2) E gives rise to a universal deformation of E A R by the deformation parameters ye (e  E).
(P3) Taking xh (h  Ef ) as complex numbers such that xe = x-e and that xh = xh if h = h and vh = vh, and ye (e  E) as sufficiently small nonzero complex numbers, E gives rise to a family of n-marked elliptic curves over C.

Proof. When n = 1, V = E = 1 and

{xh | h  ±E  T } = {0, 1, },
R = Z and A = Z[[ye]], where E = {e}. Then it is shown by Tate (cf. [18, 17]) that E is given as the Tate (elliptic) curve over Z[[ye]] formally represented as Gm/ ye which becomes the quotient space of C× = C - {0} under the multiplication by a complex number ye with |ye| < 1. Therefore, if there is a loop in E which we denote by l, then there exists a formal scheme E over A which is obtained from the Tate curve Gm/ yl and Pv = P1 (v  V ) with marked points xt (t  T with vt = v) by gluing them with e (e  E - {l}). Since E A R has an ample divisor, by Grothendieck's existence theorem, we have a required marked curve E as the algebraization of E, namely E is obtained as the formal completion of E along its closed fiber.
When there is no loop in E, as is shown by Ihara-Nakamura [13] in the case of general genus, by Grothendieck's existence theorem, E is given as the algebraization of the formal scheme over A which is obtained from Pv = P1 (v  V ) with marked points xt (t  T with vt = v) by gluing them with e (e  E).

2.2. Comparison of parameters. Let 1 = (V1, E1, T1) be a stable graph of (1, n)type which is not trivalent. Then there exists a vertex v0  V1 which has at least 4 branches. Take two elements h1, h2 of ±E1  T1 such that h1 = h2 and vh1 = vh2 = v0, and let 2 = (V2, E2, T2) be a stable graph obtained from 1 by replacing v0 with an oriented (nonloop) edge h0 such that vh1 = vh2 = vh0 and that vh = v-h0 for any h  ±E1  T1 - {h1, h2} with vh = v0. Put ei = |hi| for i = 0, 1, 2. Then we have the following identifications:

V1 = V2 - {v-h0 } (in which v0 = vh0 ), E1 = E2 - {e0}, T1 = T2, and denote by se the deformation parameters corresponding to e  E2 = E1  {e0}.

Theorem 2.2. (1) The marked Tate curves E1, E2 associated with 1, 2 respectively are iso-
morphic over R2 s-e01 [[se (e  E2)]], where

xh1

- se0

xh2

,

yei se0 sei

(i = 1, 2 with hi  T1),

ye se

(e  E1 - {e1, e2})

belong to (A2 )× if h1 = -h2, and

xh1 - xh2 , se0

ye se

(e  E1)

belong to (A2 )× if h1 = -h2. (2) The assertion (1) holds in the category of complex geometry when xh1 - xh2, ye
and se are taken to be sufficiently small complex numbers.

Proof. We prove the assertion (1). By [11, Lemma 1.2], -h0(th1)--h0(th2) belongs to

se0 ·(A2 )×, and hence E2 A2 R2 s-e01 [[se (e  E2)]] gives a universal deformation

of a universal degenerate curve with dual graph 1. Then by the universality of marked

Tate gives

curves, rise to

there exists an an isomorphism

injective homomorphism E1 = E2 . Denote by th

A1 the

 R2 s-e01 [[se]] moduli parameters

which of E2

corresponding to h  ±E2  T2. Then under this homomorphism,

Pv-h0 ; -h0 (th1 ), -h0 (th2 ), th (vh = v-h0, h = h0) = (Pv0 ; xh1 , xh2, xh (vh = v0, h = h1, h2)) ,
and hence xh1 - xh2  se0 · (A2)×. Furthermore, when h1 = -h2, the deformation parameters of

Pv-h0 ; -h0 (th1 ), -h0 (th2), th (vh = v-h0, h = h0)
corresponding to hi · (-h0) (i = 1, 2) are yhi, and hence by [11, Proposition 1.3], yhi  (sh0 · shi) · (A2 )×. When h1 = -h2, the deformation parameters of

Pv-h0 ; -h0 (th1 ), -h0 (th2), th (vh = v-h0, h = h0)

4

corresponding to h0 · h1 · (-h0) is yh1, and hence yh1  sh1 · (A2)×. The assertion (2) follows from Theorem 2.1 (P3).
2.3. Universal marked Tate curve. For a positive integer n, denote by M1,n the moduli stack over Z of stable n-marked curves of genus 1, and by M1,n its substack classifying n-marked proper smooth curves of genus 1 [6, 15, 14]. Then by definition, there exits the universal stable n-marked curve E1,n of genus 1 over M1,n.
Theorem 2.3. Let D1,n be the closed substack of M1,n consisting of n-marked degenerate curves of genus 1, and denote by N1,n the formal completion of M1,n along D1,n. Then there exists an algebraization N1a,lng of N1,n, namely N1a,lng is a scheme containing D1,n as its closed subset such that N1,n is the formal completion of N1a,lng along D1,n, and the fiber of E1,n over N1,n gives a universal family of n-marked Tate curves.
Proof. Let  = (V, E, T ) be a stable graph of (1, n)-type, and take a system of coordinates on Pv = P1R (v  V ) such that xh =  (h  E) and that {0, 1}  Pv is contained in the set of points given by xh (h  Ef with vh = v). Under this system of coordinates, one has the marked Tate curve E whose closed fiber E A R gives a family of degenerate curves over the open subspace of
S = (ph  Pvh )h±ET ph = ph (h = h, vh = vh)
defined as pe = p-e (e  E). Therefore, by taking another system of coordinates and comparing the associated marked Tate curves with the original E in a similar way to the proof of Theorem 2.2, E can be extended over the algebraization of the formal completion of S in M1,n. Then by Theorem 2.1, marked Tate curves E for various stable graphs  of (1, n)-type are glued over N1,n, and hence the assertion hods.
Definition 2.3. We call this universal family of n-marked Tate curves the universal n-marked Tate curve.
3. Unipotent periods of marked elliptic curves
3.1. Unipotent periods of Riemann surfaces. Fix nonnegative integers g, n such that 2g - 2 + n > 0. Let R be a (not necessarily compact) Riemann surface obtained from a compact Riemann surface R of genus g by removing n points. Then the category of unipotent local systems over C on R is equivalent to that of vector bundles with nilpotent flat connection on R which have regular singularities at R-R with nilpotent residues (cf. [4]). We consider the tannakian category of unipotent local systems over Q on R with fiber functor obtained from taking the fiber over a (tangential) point x  R. Then its tannakian fundamental group 1Be(R, x) is a profinite algebraic group over Q, and there exists a canonical homomorphism from the topological fundamental group 1(R, x) into 1Be(R, x).
5

For a subfield K of C, let C be a smooth curve obtained from a proper smooth
curve C of genus g over K by removing n rational points over K. We consider the
tannakian category of vector bundles with nilpotent flat connection over K on C which have regular singularities at C - C with nilpotent residues with fiber functor obtained from taking the fiber over a K-rational (tangential) point x  C. Then its tannakian fundamental group 1dR(C, x) is a profinite algebraic group over K, and by the above categorical equivalence, there exists a canonical isomorphism

1dR(C, x) K C = 1Be((C)an, x) Q C,
where (C)an denotes the Riemann surface associated with C. We call this isomorphism the unipotent period isomophism which is described by monodromy representations of 1Be((C)an, x). Similarly, for (tangential) points x, y on C, we have the associated monodromy of a nilpotent flat connection.

3.2. KZ connection and connection matrix. A KZ connection is defined on P1 is defined

as a trivial bundle with flat connection which has regular singularities along pi  P1

with residue Xi (1  i  m), where Xi are symbols satisfying

m i=1

Xi

=

0.

When

m = 3, p1 = 0, p2 = 1, p3 = , this connection is

.

Then the associated monodromy from the tangential point v0 = d/dz at 0 to z with |z| < 1 becomes a noncommutative formal power series in X0, X1 whose coefficients are multiple polylogarithm functions

Lik1 ,...,kl (z )

znl nk11 · · ·

nkl l

are power series in z over Q. If z is replaced with the tangential point -v1 = -d/dz at 1, then the associated
monodromy is called the Drinfeld associator [5, 7] which is a noncommutative formal power series (X0, X1) in X0, X1 with coefficients expressed by multiple zeta values:

(k1, ...,

kl )

=

0<n1<···<nl

nk11

1 ···

nkl l

(kl > 1).

The Drinfeld associator can be applied to calculating connection matrices for the KZ connection on the moduli space of a projective line with 4 marked points 0, 1,  and

6

x. When the associated connection has simple poles at x = 0 (resp. x = 1) with residue X0 (resp. X1), the connection matrix for the fusing move of x  (0, 1) between tangential points at 0 and 1 becomes (X0, X1).
3.3. KZB connection on the Tate curve. We review results of Calaque-EnriquezEtingof [3], Hain [10] and Luo [16] on the (universal) elliptic KZB connection following the formulation of [10]. Let q be a variable, and denote by Eq = Gm/ q the Tate (elliptic) curve over Z[[q]]. Then its closed fiber E0 = Eq Z[[q]] Z[[q]]/(q) minus the identity 1 is identified with P1 - {0, 1, }. Denote by Q T, A of noncommutative formal power series over Q in the symbols T, A. Then under taking {T, A} as a de Rham framing of the first cohomology group of Eq, Hain [10] constructs a vector bundle with flat connection, called the elliptic KZB connection, on Eq whose fibers are identified with Q T, A such that the associated flat connection has regular singularity at 1 with residue [T, A]. Put v1 = d/dz at 1  Eq = Gm/ q . Then the monodromy of the elliptic KZB connection from -v1 to v1 in Eq is called the Enriquez elliptic associator, and is represented as a noncommutative formal power series in T, A whose coefficients are called elliptic multiple zeta values. The elliptic KZB connections is described in [10, 9.2], and it gives the above KZ connection on E0 - {1} = P1 - {0, 1, } by composing with the homomorphism

Q X0, X1, X /(X0 + X1 + X)  Q T, A

given by

X0 

T eT - 1

· A, X1  [T, A], X =

T e-T - 1

· A,

where f (T, A) · x = f (adT , adA) (x) for f (T, A)  Q T, A (cf. [10, Section 18]).

3.4. KZB connection on marked Tate curves. Let 0 = (V0, E0, T0) be a stable graph with orientation of (1, n)-type which consists of two vertices v0, v1, one (nonloop) edge e and loop l with orientation such that ve = v0, v±l = v-e = v1. Then we call the associated marked Tate curve E0 the basic marked Tate curve. We construct a vector bundle with flat connection (Vv0, Fv0 ) on E0 whose each fiber is identified with the ring
A0 = Q Xt, Tl, Al

of noncommutative formal power series over Q in the symbols Xt (t  T0) and Tl, Al satisfying the condition
Xt - [Tl, Al] = 0.
tT

Put

Xl =

Tl eTl - 1

· Al, X-l =

Tl e-Tl - 1

· Al,

and Xe = -X-e = - [Tl, Al]. Then for each vertex v  V0, the sum of Xh for h  ±E0  T0 with vh = v is equal to 0.

7

Theorem 3.1. There exists a vector bundle with flat connection (V0, F0) on E0 which is constructed by gluing the KZ connection on Pv = P1 (v  V0) with regular singularities along xh with residue Xh (h  ±E0  T0 such that vh = v0), and the elliptic KZB connections on the Tate curves associated with l.

Proof. Denote by (Vv0, Fv0 ) the vector bundle with flat connection on Pv0, where Vv0 is the trivial bundle with fiber A0, and Fv0 has regular singularity along xh with residue Xh for h  ±E0  T0 such that vh = v0. As reviewed in 3.3, there exists the elliptic KZB connection (Vl, Fl) on the Tate elliptic curve Eql = Gm/ ql over Z[[ql]], where fibers of Vl are identified with Q Tl, Al  A0.
Let e (resp. -e) be tangential points over Z at xe  Pv0 = P1 (resp. the identity in Eql). Then the marked Tate curve E0 can be obtained from Pv0  Eq defined by e · -e = ye, where ye are variables, and hence E0 is proper over the ring A0 identified with

Z

we

obtain

a vector bundle with flat connection on the formal completion E0 of E0 along its

closed subscheme E0 A0 (A0/I), where I is the ideal of A0 generated by ql, ye. Then by Grothendieck's existence theorem, there exists the associated vector bundle

with flat connection on E0.

For each stable graph graph  = (V, E, T ) of (1, n)-type with orientation, we attach symbols Xh (h  ±E  T ) by the following rules:
· If  = 0, then Xh = Xh.
· For any v  V , the sum of Xh (h  ±E  T with vh = v) is 0.

· Assume that 1 = (V1, E1, T1) and 2 = (V2, E2, T2) are given in 2.2. Then

Xhi1 = Xh02 + Xhi2 (i = 1, 2), Xh1 = Xh2 (h = h1, h2)

if h1 = -h2, and if h1 = -h2.

Xh1 = Xh2 (h = h0)

Theorem 3.2. The vector bundle with flat connection (V0, F0 ) on E0 can be analytically continued to a vector bundle with flat connection on the universal n-marked
Tate curve given in Definition 2.3. This restriction to the closed fiber of E for a stable graph  = (V, E, T ) of (1, n)-type gives the KZ connection on Pv (v  V ) having regular singularities along xh with residue Xh for h  ±E  T such that vh = v.

8

Proof. Let 1 = (V1, E1, T1), 2 = (V2, E2, T2) and v0  V1, h0  E2 be as in 2.2. Then Xh02 + X-h20 = 0, and hence the KZ connection on Pv0 is obtained from the KZ connections on Pvh0 , Pv-h0 whose residues along xh0, x-h0 are Xh02 , X-h20 respectively by gluing xh0  Pvh0 and x-h0  Pv-h0 . Therefore, by Theorem 3.1, Xh1 (h  ±E  T ) and Xh2 (h  ±E  T ) satisfy the above rules.
3.5. Unipotent periods of marked elliptic curves. Let  = (V, E, T ) be a stable graph of (1, n)-type, and assume that  is trivalent. Then by taking coordinates on Pv = P1 (v  V ) such that these points corresponding to h  ±E  T with vh = v belong to {0, 1, }, A = Z[[ye (e  E)]]. Furthermore,  can be obtained from the basic graph 0 by a combination of the alterations 1  2 in 2.2 without shrinking the only one (oriented) loop l in 0. Denote by el the oriented edge in ±E obtained from l under this operations, and put E = E - {|el|}.
Definition 3.3. We define unipotent periods of E as the monodromies of (V, F) between Z-rational tangential points on a degenerating family of n-marked elliptic curves over C obtained from E as in 2.1 (P4). The unipotent periods are represented as noncommutative formal power series in Xe (e  E  T ).
Theorem 3.4. Each coefficient of unipotent periods of E as noncommutative formal power series in Xe (e  E  T ) is a formal power series in ye (e  E) whose coefficients are generated over Q by positive powers of  -1, multiple zeta values and elliptic multiple zeta values.

Proof. We will only prove the assertion in the case when  is obtained from a trivalent

graph 1 with loop by a fusing move since one can prove the assertion in general cases by a similar method. Then 1 = (V1, E1, T1) has only one loop l and nonloop edge e1 with orientation such that v±l = v-e1 and that  is obtained from 1 by the fusing move e1  e for certain edge e of .
First, we consider unipotent periods of the family of n-marked complex curve of

genus 1 obtained from

(E1 )0 = E1 A1 A1 /(ye1 )

which is a union of the Tate curve Gm/ yl and the universal rational curve C0 with

dual graph 1 - tangential points

{l}. Then the at ye = 0 (e 

unipotent periods for any E1) are integral powers of

reoxtpation -ar1oXuend1

Z-rational . Further-

more, the cross ratios associated with the maximal degeneration of C0 (cf. [1, 2.4])

belong to Z[[ye (e  E1 - {l, e1})]]. Therefore, the assertion on (E1)0 follows from [1,

Theorem 2.20] and the definition of elliptic multiple zeta values reviewed in 3.3.

Second, we consider unipotent periods of the family of n-marked elliptic curves over C obtained from E. This family is obtained by the fusing move e1  e corresponding to 0  1 - se in (0, 1)  P1R, where se can be regarded as a deformation parameter of E associated with e by Theorem 2.2. Then this fusing move is represented as the

9

monodromy along (0, 1 - se) of the connection

and hence the associated coefficients are seen in 3.2 to be formal power series in se whose coefficients are generated by multiple zeta vales over Q. This fact together with the above assertion on (E1)0 imply the original assertion on E.
