        "abstract": "The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.",

        "abstract": "The study examines the effect of cooking fuel choice on educational outcomes of adolescent children in rural India. Using multiple large-scale nationally representative datasets, we observe household solid fuel usage to adversely impact school attendance, years of schooling and age-appropriate grade progression among children. This inference is robust to alternative ways of measuring educational outcomes, other datasets, specifications and estimation techniques. Importantly, the effect is found to be more pronounced for females in comparison to the males highlighting the gendered nature of the impact. On exploring possible pathways, we find that the direct time substitution on account of solid fuel collection and preparation can explain the detrimental educational outcomes that include learning outcomes as well, even though we are unable to reject the health channel. In the light of the micro and macro level vulnerabilities posed by the COVID-19 outbreak, the paper recommends interventions that have the potential to fasten the household energy transition towards clean fuel in the post-covid world.",

        "abstract": "A family of reversible deterministic cellular automata, including the rules 54 and 201 of [Bobenko et al., Commun. Math. Phys. 158, 127 (1993)] as well as their kinetically constrained quantum (unitary) or stochastic deformations, is shown to correspond to integrable Floquet circuit models with local interactions round-a-face. Using inhomogeneous solutions of the star-triangle relation with a one or two dimensional spectral parameter, changing their functional form depending on the orientation, we provide an explicit construction of the transfer matrix and establish its conservation law and involutivity properties. Integrability is independently demonstrated by numerically exploring the spectral statistics via the Berry-Tabor conjecture. Curiously, we find that the deformed rule 54 model generically possesses no other local conserved quantities besides the net soliton current.",
