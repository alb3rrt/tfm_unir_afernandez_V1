It is the ortho-set, $P(B)$, of pure states of $B$ equipped with an \"ortho-topology\", which is a collection of subsets of $P(B)$, defined via a hull-kernel construction with respects to closed left ideals of $B$. We establish a generalization of the Gelfand theorem by showing that a bijection between the Gelfand spectra of two quantum systems that preserves the respective ortho-topologies is induced by a Jordan isomorphism between the self-adjoint parts of the underlying $C^*$-algebras (i.e. an isomorphism of the quantum systems), when the underlying $C^*$-algebras satisfy a mild condition.",

More spectral data is needed together with some sign indicators to remove the unitary ambiguities. This work specifies the spectral and sign information required for a unique reconstruction of general matrices. More specifically, the spectral information consists of the spectra of the $N$ nested main minors of the original matrix of the sizes $1,2,\\dots,N$. However, due to the complicated nature of the required sign data, improvements are needed in order to make the reconstruction procedure feasible. With this in mind, we restrict our attention to banded matrices where the amount of spectral data exceeds the number of the unknown matrix entries. It is shown that one can take advantage of this redundancy to guarantee unique reconstruction of {\\it generic} matrices. The space of non-generic matrices is defined either via a set of polynomial equations or via a set of equations involving eigenvectors. Thus, the space of non-generic matrices has a positive co-dimension as a subspace of the space of all matrices. It is shown that one can optimize the ratio between redundancy and genericity by using the freedom of choice of the spectral information input. We demonstrate our constructions in detail for pentadiagonal matrices.",

An important structure involved is a collection of certain $\\text{SL}(2, \\mathbb{C})$ characters on a given manifold which serve as the simple object types in the corresponding category. Chern-Simons invariants and adjoint Reidemeister torsions play a key role in the construction, and they are related to topological twists and quantum dimensions, respectively, of simple objects. The modular $S$-matrix is computed from local operators and follows a trial-and-error procedure. It is currently unknown how to produce data beyond the modular $S$- and $T$-matrices. There are also a number of subtleties in the construction which remain to be solved. In this paper, we consider an infinite family of 3-manifolds, that is, torus bundles over the circle. We show that the modular data produced by such manifolds are realized by the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariantization of certain pointed premodular categories. Here the equivariantization is performed for the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-action sending a simple (invertible) object to its inverse, also called the particle-hole symmetry. It is our hope that this extensive class of examples will shed light on how to improve the program to recover the full data of a premodular category.",

We applied the same methodology for target selection, data processing, and light-curve fitting as we did in our Year 1 study. Out of the 15 transiting systems selected for analysis, seven - HAT-P-7, KELT-1, KELT-9, KELT-16, KELT-20, Kepler-13A, and WASP-12 - show statistically significant secondary eclipses and day-night atmospheric brightness modulations. Small eastward dayside hotspot offsets were measured for KELT-9b and WASP-12b. KELT-1, Kepler-13A, and WASP-12 show additional phase-curve variability attributed to the tidal distortion of the host star; the amplitudes of these signals are consistent with theoretical predictions. We combined occultation measurements from TESS and Spitzer to compute dayside brightness temperatures, TESS-band geometric albedos, Bond albedos, and phase integrals for several systems. The new albedo values solidify the previously reported trend between dayside temperature and geometric albedo for planets with $1500<T_{\\mathrm{day}}<3000$ K. For Kepler-13Ab, we carried out an atmospheric retrieval of the full secondary eclipse spectrum, which revealed a non-inverted temperature-pressure profile, significant H$_{2}$O and K absorption in the near-infrared, evidence for strong optical atmospheric opacity due to sodium, and a confirmation of the high geometric albedo inferred from our simpler analysis. We explore the implications of the phase integrals (ratios of Bond to geometric albedos) for understanding exoplanet clouds. We also report updated transit ephemerides for all of the systems studied in this work.",

The long-term stability of such systems may be disrupted if a distant inclined companion excites the eccentricity and inclination of the inner planets via the eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism. However, the star-planet and the planet-planet interactions can help stabilize the system. Here, we extend the previous stability criterion that considered only the companion-planet and planet-planet interactions by also accounting for short-range forces or effects, specifically, relativistic precession induced by the host star. A general analytical stability criterion is developed for planetary systems with $N$ inner planets and a far-away inclined perturber by comparing precession rates of relevant dynamical effects. Furthermore, we demonstrate as examples that in systems with $2$ and $3$ planets, the analytical criterion is consistent with numerical simulations using a combination of Gauss's averaging method and direct N-body integration. This new stability criterion extends the parameter space in which inclined companions of multi-planet systems can inhabit.",

We compute the derivatives of the N-body coordinates and velocities as a function of time with respect to the initial conditions and masses by propagating the Jacobian along with the N-body integration. For the first time we obtain the derivatives of the transit times with respect to the initial conditions and masses using the chain rule, which is quicker and more accurate than using finite differences or automatic differentiation. We implement this algorithm in an open source package, NbodyGradient.jl, written in the Julia language, which has been used in the optimization and error analysis of transit-timing variations in the TRAPPIST-1 system. We present tests of the accuracy and precision of the code, and show that it compares favorably in speed to other integrators which are written in C.",

The finding that the mini-Neptune K2-18b could host a liquid water ocean beneath a mostly hydrogen envelope motivates a detailed examination of the phase structures of water-rich planets. To this end, we present new internal structure models for super-Earths and mini-Neptunes that enable detailed characterisation of a planet's water component. We use our models to explore the possible phase structures of water worlds and find that a diverse range of interiors are possible, from oceans sandwiched between two layers of ice to supercritical interiors beneath steam atmospheres. We determine how the bulk properties and surface conditions of a water world affect its ocean depth, finding that oceans can be up to hundreds of times deeper than on Earth. For example, a planet with a 300 K surface can possess H$_2$O oceans with depths from 30-500 km, depending on its mass and composition. We also constrain the region of mass-radius space in which planets with H/He envelopes could host liquid H$_2$O, noting that the liquid phase can persist at temperatures up to 647 K at high pressures of $218$-$7\\times10^4$ bar. Such H/He envelopes could contribute significantly to the planet radius while retaining liquid water at the surface, depending on the planet mass and temperature profile. Our findings highlight the exciting possibility that habitable conditions may be present on planets much larger than Earth.",

We provide a refinement of this localization procedure, which allows to compute motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants. Using this approach, we prove a universal formula which gives the BPS invariants of any toric quiver, up to undetermined contributions which are invariant under Poincar\u00e9 duality. When the toric Calabi-Yau threefold has compact divisors, these self-Poincar\u00e9 dual contributions have a complicated dependance on the stability parameters, but explicit computations suggest that they drastically simplify for the self-stability condition (also called attractor chamber). We conjecture a universal formula for the attractor invariants, which applies to any toric Calabi-Yau singularity with compact divisors.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by recent experiments indicating strong superconductivity and intricate correlated insulating and flavor-polarized physics in mirror-symmetric twisted trilayer graphene, we study the effects of interactions in this system close to the magic angle, using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. We identify asymptotically exact correlated many-body ground states at all integer filling fractions $\\nu$ of the flat bands. To determine their fate when moving away from these fine-tuned points, we apply self-consistent Hartree-Fock numerics and analytic perturbation theory, with good agreement between the two approaches. This allows us to construct a phase diagram for the system as a function of $\\nu$ and the displacement field, the crucial experimental tuning parameter of the system, and study the spectra of the different phases. The phase diagram is dominated by a correlated semimetallic intervalley coherent state and an insulating sublattice-polarized phase around charge neutrality, $\\nu=0$, with additional spin-polarization being present at quarter ($\\nu=-2$) or three quarter ($\\nu=+2$) fillings of the quasi-flat bands. We further study the superconducting instabilities emerging from these correlated states, both in the absence and in the additional presence of electron-phonon coupling, also taking into account possible Wess-Zumino-Witten terms. In the experimentally relevant regime, we find triplet pairing to dominate, possibly explaining the observed violation of the Pauli limit. Our results have several consequences for experiments as well as future theoretical work and illustrate the rich physics resulting from the interplay of almost flat bands and dispersive Dirac cones in twisted trilayer graphene.",

Conventional post-training pruning often incurs higher training budgets. In contrast, this paper aims to trim down both the training memory overhead and the inference complexity, without scarifying the achievable accuracy. We launch and report the first-of-its-kind comprehensive exploration, on taking a unified approach of integrating sparsity in ViTs \"from end to end\". Specifically, instead of training full ViTs, we dynamically extract and train sparse subnetworks, while sticking to a fixed small parameter budget. Our approach jointly optimizes model parameters and explores connectivity throughout training, ending up with one sparse network as the final output. The approach is seamlessly extended from unstructured to structured sparsity, the latter by considering to guide the prune-and-grow of self-attention heads inside ViTs. For additional efficiency gains, we further co-explore data and architecture sparsity, by plugging in a novel learnable token selector to adaptively determine the currently most vital patches. Extensive results validate the effectiveness of our proposals on ImageNet with diverse ViT backbones. For instance, at 40% structured sparsity, our sparsified DeiT-Base can achieve 0.42% accuracy gain, at 33.13% and 24.70% running time} savings, compared to its dense counterpart. Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that the proposed sparse (co-)training can even improve the ViT accuracy rather than compromising it, making sparsity a tantalizing \"free lunch\". For example, our sparsified DeiT-Small at 5%, 50% sparsity for (data, architecture), improves 0.28% top-1 accuracy and meanwhile enjoys 49.32% FLOPs and 4.40% running time savings.",

In our analysis we applied clustering data mining technique in order to identify minimal amount of item's ratings required from recommender system's users, in order to be assigned to a correct cluster. In this context, cluster quality is being monitored and in case of reaching certain cluster quality threshold, the rec-ommender system could start to generate recommendations for given user, as in this point cold-start problem is considered as resolved.

As the fundamental basis elements leveraged in approximation, higher order control occupation kernels represent iterated integration after multiplication by a given controller in a vector valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space. In a regularized regression setting, the unique optimizer for a particular optimization problem is expressed as a linear combination of these occupation kernels, which converts an infinite dimensional optimization problem to a finite dimensional optimization problem through the representer theorem. Interestingly, the vector valued structure of the Hilbert space allows for simultaneous approximation of the drift and control effectiveness components of the control affine system. Several experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",

Existing summarization systems, however, often either fail to support or act robustly on this query focused summarization task. We introduce LaQSum, the first unified text summarization system that learns Latent Queries from documents for abstractive summarization with any existing query forms. Under a deep generative framework, our system jointly optimizes a latent query model and a conditional language model, allowing users to plug-and-play queries of any type at test time. Despite learning from only generic summarization data and requiring no further optimization for downstream summarization tasks, our system robustly outperforms strong comparison systems across summarization benchmarks with different query types, document settings, and target domains.",

This enables us to find the patterns of GNSS signal availability and create 3D maps. The paper applies algorithms to GNSS signal strength patterns based on a boot-strapped technique that iteratively trains the signal classifiers while generating the map. Results of the proposed technique demonstrate the ability to create 3D maps using automatically processed GNSS data.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new primal-dual method for computing an equilibrium of generalized (continuous) Nash game (referred to as generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP)) where each player's feasible strategy set depends on the other players' strategies. The method is based on a new form of Lagrangian function with a quadratic approximation. First, we reformulate a GNEP as a saddle point computation using the new Lagrangian and establish equivalence between a saddle point of the Lagrangian and an equilibrium of the GNEP. We then propose a simple algorithm that is convergent to the saddle point. Furthermore, we establish global convergence by assuming that the Lagrangian function satisfies the Kurdyka-\u0141ojasiewicz property. A distinctive feature of our analysis is to make use of the new Lagrangian as a potential function to guide the iterate convergence, which is based on the idea of turning a descent method into a multiplier method. Our method has two novel features over existing approaches: (i) it requires neither boundedness assumptions on the strategy set and the set of multipliers of each player, nor any boundedness assumptions on the iterates generated by the algorithm; (ii) it leads to a Jacobi-type decomposition scheme, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first development of a distributed algorithm to solve a general class of GNEPs. Numerical experiments are performed on benchmark test problems and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

In this work, we attempt to \"open the black-box\" on deep convolutional models to inform future architectures for music audio tasks, and explain the excellent performance of deep convolutions that model spectrograms as 2D images. To this end, we expand recent explainability discussions in deep learning for natural image data to music audio data through systematic experiments using the deep features learned by various convolutional architectures. We demonstrate that deep convolutional features perform well across various target tasks, whether or not they are extracted from deep architectures originally trained on that task. Additionally, deep features exhibit high similarity to hand-crafted wavelet features, whether the deep features are extracted from a trained or untrained model.",

If a fermion species gains a huge mass in the true vacuum, the corresponding particles get trapped in the false vacuum as they do not have sufficient energy to penetrate the bubble wall. After the FOPT, the fermions are compressed into the false vacuum remnants to form non-topological solitons called Fermi-balls, and then collapse to PBHs due to the long-range Yukawa attractive force. We derive the PBH mass and abundance, showing that for a $\\mathcal{O}({\\rm GeV})$ FOPT the PBHs could be $\\sim10^{17}$ g and explain all of dark matter. If the FOPT happens at higher scale, PBHs are typically overproduced and extra dilution mechanism is necessary to satisfy current constraints.",

While recent transport results attribute the anomalous low temperature conduction to two-dimensional surface states, important alternatives, such as conduction channel residing in one-dimensional dislocation lines, have not been adequately explored. Here we study SmB6 with scanning microwave impedance microscopy and uncover evidence for conducting one-dimensional states terminating at surface step edges. These states remain conducting up to room temperature, indicating unusual robustness against scattering and an unconventional origin. Our results bring to light a heretofore undetected conduction route in SmB6 that contributes to the low temperature transport. The unique scenario of intrinsic one-dimensional conducting channels in a highly insulating correlated bulk offers a one-dimensional platform that may host exotic physics.",

Application domains where SOPPs naturally occur include natural language processing, speech recognition, and computer vision. Typical SOPPs have an extremely large label set, which grows exponentially as a function of the size of the output. Existing generalization analysis implies generalization bounds with at least a square-root dependency on the cardinality $d$ of the label set, which can be vacuous in practice. In this paper, we significantly improve the state of the art by developing novel high-probability bounds with a logarithmic dependency on $d$. Moreover, we leverage the lens of algorithmic stability to develop generalization bounds in expectation without any dependency on $d$. Our results therefore build a solid theoretical foundation for learning in large-scale SOPPs. Furthermore, we extend our results to learning with weakly dependent data.",

Recent line of work posits strong benefits for model generalization and transfer when model size, data size, and compute budget are increased for the pre-training. It remains however still largely unclear whether the observed transfer improvement due to increase in scale also holds when source and target data distributions are far apart from each other. In this work we conduct large-scale pre-training on large source datasets of either natural (ImageNet-21k/1k) or medical chest X-Ray images and compare full and few-shot transfer using different target datasets from both natural and medical imaging domains. Our observations provide evidence that while pre-training and transfer on closely related datasets do show clear benefit of increasing model and data size during pre-training, such benefits are not clearly visible when source and target datasets are further apart. These observations hold across both full and few-shot transfer and indicate that scaling laws hinting improvement of generalization and transfer with increasing model and data size are incomplete and should also take into account the degree of how distinct the source and target data distributions are, to correctly predict effect of model size and data size variation during pre-training on transfer.

In this work, we demonstrate that the electronic, superconducting and optical properties of air-stable two-dimensional metals can be controllably tuned by the formation of alloys. Environmentally robust large-area two-dimensional InxGa1-x alloys are synthesized by Confinement Heteroepitaxy (CHet). Near-complete solid solubility is achieved with no evidence of phase segregation, and the composition is tunable over the full range of x by changing the relative elemental composition of the precursor. The optical and electronic properties directly correlate with alloy composition, wherein the dielectric function, band structure, superconductivity, and charge transfer from the metal to graphene are all controlled by the indium/gallium ratio in the 2D metal layer.",

There are currently two methods to measure this dependence at redshift $z>0$, and that is equally important to estimate the CMB temperature $T_0$ at the present epoch $z=0$. The first method is based on the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect for a galaxy cluster. aThe second method is based on the analysis of the populations of atomic and molecular energy levels observed in the absorption spectra of quasars. This method allows $T_{\\rm CMB}(z)$ to be measured directly. We present new estimates of $T_{\\rm CMB}(z_i)$ in the redshift range $1.7\\le z_i \\le3.3$ based on the analysis of excitation of the CO rotational levels and C\\,{\\sc i} fine-structure levels in 15 absorption systems. We take into account collisional excitation of CO and C\\,{\\sc i} with hydrogen atoms and H$_2$ and radiative pumping of C\\,{\\sc i} by the interstellar ultraviolet radiation. Applying this corrections leads to a systematic decrease in the previously obtained estimates of $T_{\\rm CMB}(z_i)$ (for some systems the magnitude of the effect is $\\sim$10\\%). Combining our measurements with the measurements of $T_{\\rm CMB}(z)$ in galaxy clusters we have obtained a constraint on the parameter $\\beta=+0.010\\pm0.013$, which characterizes the deviation of the CMB temperature from the standard relation, $T_{\\rm CMB} = T_0(1 + z)^{1-\\beta}$, and an independent estimate of the CMB temperature at the present epoch, $T_0 = 2.719\\pm0.009$\\,K, which agrees well with the estimate from orbital measurements, $T_0 = 2.7255\\pm0.0006$\\,K. This independent estimate is very important because it was obtained using cosmological data, in contrast to satellite measurements, which are obtained \"here\" and \"now\".",

It is based on the use of probabilistic models and deep neural networks. We distinguish two approaches to probabilistic deep learning: probabilistic neural networks and deep probabilistic models. The former employs deep neural networks that utilize probabilistic layers which can represent and process uncertainty; the latter uses probabilistic models that incorporate deep neural network components which capture complex non-linear stochastic relationships between the random variables. We discuss some major examples of each approach including Bayesian neural networks and mixture density networks (for probabilistic neural networks), and variational autoencoders, deep Gaussian processes and deep mixed effects models (for deep probabilistic models). TensorFlow Probability is a library for probabilistic modeling and inference which can be used for both approaches of probabilistic deep learning. We include its code examples for illustration.",

We demonstrate that if each subpopulation is informed of its infection rate and reduces interactions accordingly, the fraction of the subpopulation infected can remain below half for all time instants. To this end, we first modify the basic SIS model by introducing a state dependent parameter representing the frequency of interactions between subpopulations. Thereafter, we show that for this modified SIS model, the spectral radius of a suitably-defined matrix being not greater than one causes all the agents, regardless of their initial sickness levels, to converge to the healthy state; assuming non-trivial disease spread, the spectral radius being greater than one leads to the existence of a unique endemic equilibrium, which is also asymptotically stable. Finally, by leveraging the aforementioned results, we show that the fraction of (sub)populations infected never exceeds half.",

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents proved to be to a force to be reckon with in many complex games like Chess and Go. We can look at the stock market historical price series and movements as a complex imperfect information environment in which we try to maximize return - profit and minimize risk. This paper reviews the progress made so far with deep reinforcement learning in the subdomain of AI in finance, more precisely, automated low-frequency quantitative stock trading. Many of the reviewed studies had only proof-of-concept ideals with experiments conducted in unrealistic settings and no real-time trading applications. For the majority of the works, despite all showing statistically significant improvements in performance compared to established baseline strategies, no decent profitability level was obtained. Furthermore, there is a lack of experimental testing in real-time, online trading platforms and a lack of meaningful comparisons between agents built on different types of DRL or human traders. We conclude that DRL in stock trading has showed huge applicability potential rivalling professional traders under strong assumptions, but the research is still in the very early stages of development.",

Taking advantage of homogeneity, a sufficient statistic is the ratio of wealth to the primary insurance amount (PIA). If the investor's wealth to PIA ratio exceeds a certain threshold, individuals should defer Social Security for at least a year. The optimal threshold depends on mortality assumptions and an individual's utility preferences, but is less sensitive to capital market assumptions. The threshold wealth to PIA ratio increases from 5.5 for men and 5.2 for women at age 62 to 11.1 for men and 10.4 for women at age 69. Below the threshold wealth to PIA ratio, individuals claim Social Security to raise consumption. Above this level, investors can afford to fund consumption out of wealth for at least one year, and then claim a higher benefit.",

In this paper, we study the applicability of spectral reconstructions for the resolution of the Gibbs phenomenon in Fourier modal methods. We show in practice, the emergence and propagation of a computational disorder potentially incapacitate most of the popular post-processing techniques from retrieving a Fourier spectral solution in the vicinity of discontinuities. Nonetheless, we numerically substantiate and rigorously prove that the classical Gegenbauer method remains exceptionally robust against this phenomenon. Specifically, we show the Gegenbauer reconstruction error at worst diminishes, proportional to O(N^{-1}) for the Fourier order N, while the convergence can be even exponentially fast up to a constant summand.",

In this paper we study the path integral representation of a particle moving in an arbitrary potential using the most general form of the GUP containing both the linear and quadratic contributions in momentum. First we work out the action of the particle in an arbitrary potential and hence find an upper bound to the velocity of a free particle. This upper bound interestingly imposes restrictions on the relation between the GUP parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. Analysis shows that $ \\beta > 4 \\alpha^2$.

Representation learning often plays an important role in the effectiveness of deep clustering, and thus can be a principal cause of performance degradation.

Our deep-learning-based representation learning method is motivated by the properties of classical spectral clustering. Instance discrimination learns similarities among data and feature decorrelation removes redundant correlation among features. We utilize an instance discrimination method in which learning individual instance classes leads to learning similarity among instances. Through detailed experiments and examination, we show that the approach can be adapted to learning a latent space for clustering. We design novel softmax-formulated decorrelation constraints for learning. In evaluations of image clustering using CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-10, our method achieves accuracy of 81.5% and 95.4%, respectively. We also show that the softmax-formulated constraints are compatible with various neural networks.",

Learning to use a new app is often achieved via trial-and-error, accelerated by transfer of knowledge from past experiences with like apps. The prospect of building a smarter smartphone - one that can learn how to achieve tasks using mobile apps - is tantalizing. In this paper we explore the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the goal of advancing this aspiration. We introduce an RL-based framework for learning to accomplish tasks in mobile apps. RL agents are provided with states derived from the underlying representation of on-screen elements, and rewards that are based on progress made in the task. Agents can interact with screen elements by tapping or typing. Our experimental results, over a number of mobile apps, show that RL agents can learn to accomplish multi-step tasks, as well as achieve modest generalization across different apps. More generally, we develop a platform which addresses several engineering challenges to enable an effective RL training environment. Our AppBuddy platform is compatible with OpenAI Gym and includes a suite of mobile apps and benchmark tasks that supports a diversity of RL research in the mobile app setting.",

Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) exacerbates matters by imposing various constraints on communication and observability. In this work, we consider the fundamental hurdle affecting both value-based and policy-gradient approaches: an exponential blowup of the action space with the number of agents. For value-based methods, it poses challenges in accurately representing the optimal value function. For policy gradient methods, it makes training the critic difficult and exacerbates the problem of the lagging critic. We show that from a learning theory perspective, both problems can be addressed by accurately representing the associated action-value function with a low-complexity hypothesis class. This requires accurately modelling the agent interactions in a sample efficient way. To this end, we propose a novel tensorised formulation of the Bellman equation. This gives rise to our method Tesseract, which views the Q-function as a tensor whose modes correspond to the action spaces of different agents. Algorithms derived from Tesseract decompose the Q-tensor across agents and utilise low-rank tensor approximations to model agent interactions relevant to the task. We provide PAC analysis for Tesseract-based algorithms and highlight their relevance to the class of rich observation MDPs. Empirical results in different domains confirm Tesseract's gains in sample efficiency predicted by the theory.",

A full understanding of the quantum-classical transition, however, also requires an explanation for the absence of macroscopic superpositions to solve the quantum measurement problem. Stochastic reformulations of quantum mechanics based on spontaneous collapses of the wavefunction are a popular approach to this issue. In this article, we derive the dynamic equations for the four most important spontaneous collapse models - Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) theory, continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) model, Di\u00f3si-Penrose model, and dissipative GRW model - in the Wigner framework. The resulting master equations are approximated by Fokker-Planck equations. Moreover, we use the phase-space form of GRW theory to test, via molecular dynamics simulations, David Albert's suggestion that the stochasticity induced by spontaneous collapses is responsible for the emergence of thermodynamic irreversibility. The simulations show that, for initial conditions leading to anti-thermodynamic behavior in the classical case, GRW-type perturbations do not lead to thermodynamic behavior. Consequently, the GRW-based equilibration mechanism proposed by Albert is not observed.",

On the other hand, the swampland distance conjecture (SDC) predicts that de Sitter space becomes unstable by the descent of the low energy degrees of freedom from UV. This results in the rapid increase in the energy inside the cosmological horizon, the distribution of which can be constrained by the CKN bound. We study the CKN bound in de Sitter space in detail and point out that when the SDC is combined, the bound on the slow-roll parameter which forbids the eternal inflation is obtained.",

However, this new task, as a binary classification, is less semantically informative. In this study, we present a new text encoder pre-training method that improves ELECTRA based on multi-task learning. Specifically, we train the discriminator to simultaneously detect replaced tokens and select original tokens from candidate sets. We further develop two techniques to effectively combine all pre-training tasks: (1) using attention-based networks for task-specific heads, and (2) sharing bottom layers of the generator and the discriminator. Extensive experiments on GLUE and SQuAD datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and the efficiency of our proposed method.",

The proposed receiver has two phases of waking up. The first phase uses an integrated CMOS Schottky diodes to detect the signal power at a low bias current. The approach dissipates low quiescent power and allows the reuse of the design in multiple frequency bands with only modifying the matching network. In the second phase, a data-locked startable oscillator is proposed to correlate the received data with a target signature. This design eliminates the area and power dissipation of an external crystal oscillator and only turns on when the second phase is activated. By correlating to a target signature, the second phase also reduces the probability of a false alarm (PFA) that would otherwise wake up the high-power bulk of the system. The two-phase approach leads to significant reduction in average power consumption when compared to a single-phase design. This implementation targets sub-ms wake-up latency and operates in the unlicensed band at a 750-MHz carrier frequency with a data rate of 200 kbps. The design achieves $\\sim$8.45pJ/bit and $<$-50 dBm of input sensitivity and average power of 1.69$\\mu$W.

This paper presents an approach for proactively reasoning about provenance metadata within the Automatic Cryptographic Data Centric (ACDC) security architecture, a new security infrastructure in which all data interactions are considered at a coarse granularity, similar to the Function as a Service model. At this scale, we have found that data interactions are manageable for the proactive specification and evaluation of provenance policies -- constraints placed on provenance metadata to prevent the consumption of untrusted data. This paper provides a model for proactively evaluating provenance metadata in the ACDC paradigm as well as a case study of an electronic voting scheme to demonstrate the applicability of ACDC and the provenance policies needed to ensure data integrity.",

The obvious disadvantages of these approaches are the need for labelled data for each language pair and the high cost required to maintain several language-specific models. To overcome these problems, we explore different approaches to multilingual, word-level QE. We show that these QE models perform on par with the current language-specific models. In the cases of zero-shot and few-shot QE, we demonstrate that it is possible to accurately predict word-level quality for any given new language pair from models trained on other language pairs. Our findings suggest that the word-level QE models based on powerful pre-trained transformers that we propose in this paper generalise well across languages, making them more useful in real-world scenarios.",

This paper develops an iterative approach, inspired by the current security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) practice, enabling system operators to determine risk-cognizant contingency reserve requirements and their allocation with minimal alterations to the current SCUC practice. The proposed approach uses generator and transmission system reliability models, including failure-to synchronize and adverse conditions, to compute contingency probabilities, which inform a risk-based system reliability assessment, and ensures reserve deliverability by learning the response of generators to post-contingency states within the SCUC. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using the Grid Modernization Lab Consortium update of the Reliability Test System.",

We report the results of eight models (LSI, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, GloVe, FastText, ELMO, and USE) evaluated on three different public available corpora: Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus, Clough and Stevenson and Webis Crowd Paraphrase Corpus 2011.

Our findings and those of other researchers who have used deep learning models show that DL models are very competitive with traditional state-of-the-art approaches and have potential that should be further developed.",

Our ability to model nonlinear effects in late time matter perturbations will be a key to unlock the full potential of these datasets, and the area of initial condition reconstruction is attracting growing attention. Iterative reconstruction developed in Ref. [1] is a technique designed to reconstruct the displacement field from the observed galaxy distribution. The nonlinear displacement field and initial linear density field are highly correlated. Therefore, reconstructing the nonlinear displacement field enables us to extract the primordial cosmological information better than from the late time density field at the level of the two-point statistics. This paper will test to what extent the iterative reconstruction can recover the true displacement field and construct a perturbation theory model for the postreconstructed field. We model the iterative reconstruction process with Lagrangian perturbation theory~(LPT) up to third order for dark matter in real space and compare it with $N$-body simulations. We find that the simulated iterative reconstruction does not converge to the nonlinear displacement field, and the discrepancy mainly appears in the shift term, i.e., the term correlated directly with the linear density field. On the contrary, our 3LPT model predicts that the iterative reconstruction should converge to the nonlinear displacement field. We discuss the sources of discrepancy, including numerical noise/artifacts on small scales, and present an ad hoc phenomenological model that improves the agreement.",

We did not find any significant dependence of the disk radii and continuum fluxes on a single parameter on the core scale, such as the non-thermal line width, magnetic field orientation and strength, or magnitude and orientation of the velocity gradient. Among these parameters, we only found a positive correlation between the magnitude of the velocity gradient and the non-thermal line width. Thus, the observed velocity gradients are more likely related to turbulent motion but not large-scale rotation. Our results of no clear dependence of the disk radii on these parameters are more consistent with the expectation from non-ideal MHD simulations of disk formation in collapsing cores, where the disk size is self-regulated by magnetic braking and diffusion, compared to other simulations which only include turbulence and/or a magnetic field misaligned with the rotational axis. Therefore, our results could hint that the non-ideal MHD effects play a more important role in the disk formation. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the influences on the observed disk size distribution by dynamical interaction in a stellar cluster or amounts of angular momentum on the core scale, which cannot be probed with the current data.",

Its efficiency comes from minimizing the number of collision check samples. This reduction in sampling relies on heuristics that predict the likelihood that samples will be useful in the search process. Specifically, heuristics (1) prioritize more promising search regions; (2) cull samples from local minima regions; and (3) steer the search away from previously observed collision states. Empirical evaluations show that our method finds shorter or comparable-length solution paths in significantly less time than commonly used methods. We demonstrate that these performance gains can be largely attributed to our approach to achieve sample efficiency.",

This method is applied to $^{204}$Pb$(p,p)$, $^{206}$Pb$(p,p)$, and $^{208}$Pb$(p,p)$ at $E_p=295$ MeV to obtain improved neutron densities and radii from experimental cross section data. The reaction calculation is performed according to the relativistic impulse approximation using the modified Murdock and Horowitz model with density-dependent effective $NN$ interaction. Analysis of Pb isotopes is performed using theoretical densities given by the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov and nonrelativistic Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations and the experimental density extracted from the $(p,p)$ data at 295 MeV. The isotopic ratios ($R(\\sigma)$) of the $^{A}$Pb$(p,p)$-to-$^{206}$Pb$(p,p)$ cross sections are analyzed in connection with the isotopic differences ($D(\\rho_n)$ and $D(r_n)$) in neutron densities $(\\rho_n(r))$ and radii $(r_n)$ between $^A$Pb and $^{208}$Pb. A hole-model analysis is performed, assuming $^{204}$Pb and $^{206}$Pb as a $^{208}$Pb core and neutron holes to clarify the one-to-one correspondence between isotopic structure properties such as $D(\\rho_n)$ and $D(r_n)$ and the isotopic cross-section ratio. By fitting $R(\\sigma)$, the values of $D(\\rho_n)$ and $D(r_n)$ are extracted from the experimental $(p,p)$ cross section data with less uncertainty of the structure and reaction models. The isotopic neutron radius difference between $^{206}$Pb and $^{208}$Pb was obtained as $D(r_n)=-0.012$ fm with an acceptable range of $D(r_n)=-0.03 \\sim -0.006$ fm.",

We present a path splitting algorithm to create blue and red pod groupings and detail steps for a meta-algorithm that optimizes over these pods in parallel. We assessed how our method works on a testbed of simulated path optimization scenarios using various optimization tasks and characterize how it scales with additional threads.

Concretely, if all else remains constant, increasing (resp. decreasing) the value of one or more features must not decrease (resp. increase) the value of the prediction. Despite comprehensive efforts on learning monotonic classifiers, dedicated approaches for explaining monotonic classifiers are scarce and classifier-specific. This paper describes novel algorithms for the computation of one formal explanation of a (black-box) monotonic classifier. These novel algorithms are polynomial in the run time complexity of the classifier and the number of features. Furthermore, the paper presents a practically efficient model-agnostic algorithm for enumerating formal explanations.",

Such a code is denoted by $(n,m,p)$-QRAC. If cooperation is allowed through a shared random string we call it a QRAC with shared randomness. We prove that for any $(n,m,p)$-QRAC with shared randomness the parameter $p$ is upper bounded by $ \\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2^{m-1}}{n}}$. For $m=2$ this gives a new bound of $p\\le \\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2n}}$ confirming a conjecture by Imamichi and Raymond (AQIS'18). Our bound implies that the previously known analytical constructions of $(3,2,\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{6}})$- , $(4,2,\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}})$- and $(6,2,\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}})$-QRACs are optimal. To obtain our bound we investigate the geometry of quantum states in the Bloch vector representation and make use of a geometric interpretation of the fact that any two quantum states have a non-negative overlap.",

In this work, we outline a road-map for future development of FOON and its application in robotic systems for task planning as well as knowledge acquisition from demonstration. We propose preliminary ideas to show how a FOON can be created in a real-world scenario with a robot and human teacher in a way that can jointly augment existing knowledge in a FOON and teach a robot the skills it needs to replicate the demonstrated actions and solve a given manipulation problem.",

The purpose of this study is to expand this research area by integrating computer vision and UAS technology to automate public inspection. As an initial case study for this work, a dataset of common foreign object debris (FOD) is developed to assess the potential of light-weight automated detection. This paper presents the rationale and creation of this dataset. Future iterations of our work will include further technical details analyzing experimental implementation. At a local airport, UAS and portable cameras are used to collect the data contained in the initial version of this dataset. After collecting these videos of FOD, they were split into individual frames and stored as several thousand images. These frames are then annotated following standard computer vision format and stored in a folder-structure that reflects our creation method. The dataset annotations are validated using a custom tool that could be abstracted to fit future applications. Initial detection models were successfully created using the famous You Only Look Once algorithm, which indicates the practicality of the proposed data. Finally, several potential scenarios that could utilize either this dataset or similar methods for other public service are presented.",

User engagement is one of the most important metrics for evaluating open-domain dialog systems, and could also be used as real-time feedback to benefit dialog policy learning. Existing work on detecting user disengagement typically requires hand-labeling many dialog samples. We propose HERALD, an efficient annotation framework that reframes the training data annotation process as a denoising problem. Specifically, instead of manually labeling training samples, we first use a set of labeling heuristics to label training samples automatically. We then denoise the weakly labeled data using the Shapley algorithm. Finally, we use the denoised data to train a user engagement detector. Our experiments show that HERALD improves annotation efficiency significantly and achieves 86% user disengagement detection accuracy in two dialog corpora.",

UX design researchers explore how users react to the interface/content of their social media feeds; Data science researchers analyze the misinformation flow in these feeds to detect alternative narratives and state-sponsored disinformation campaigns. We took a critical look into the intersection of these approaches to understand how Parler's interface itself is conductive to the flow of misinformation and the perception of \"free speech\" among its audience. Parler drew widespread attention leading up to and after the 2020 U.S. elections as the \"alternative\" place for free speech, as a reaction to other mainstream social media platform which actively engaged in labeling misinformation with content warnings. Because platforms like Parler are disruptive to the social media landscape, we believe the evaluation uniquely uncovers the platform's conductivity to the spread of misinformation.",

        "abstract": "We derive combinatorial necessary conditions for discrete-time quantum walks defined by regular mixed graphs to be periodic. If the quantum walk is periodic, all the eigenvalues of the time evolution matrices must be algebraic integers. Focusing on this, we explore which ring the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials should belong to. On the other hand, the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials of $\\eta$-Hermitian adjacency matrices have combinatorial implications. From these, we can find combinatorial implications in the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials of the time evolution matrices, and thus derive combinatorial necessary conditions for mixed graphs to be periodic. For example, if a $k$-regular mixed graph with $n$ vertices is periodic, then $2n/k$ must be an integer. As an application of this work, we determine periodicity of mixed complete graphs and mixed graphs with a prime number of vertices.",

        "abstract": "Classical model-based imaging methods for ultrasound elasticity inverse problem require prior constraints about the underlying elasticity patterns, while finding the appropriate hand-crafted prior for each tissue type is a challenge. In contrast, standard data-driven methods count solely on supervised learning on the training data pairs leading to massive network parameters for unnecessary physical model relearning which might not be consistent with the governing physical models of the imaging system. Fusing the physical forward model and noise statistics with data-adaptive priors leads to a united reconstruction framework that guarantees the learned reconstruction agrees with the physical models while coping with the limited training data. In this paper, we propose a new methodology for estimating the elasticity image by solving a regularized optimization problem which benefits from the physics-based modeling via a data-fidelity term and adversarially learned priors via a regularization term. In this method, the regularizer is trained based on the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) objective function which tries to distinguish the distribution of clean and noisy images. Leveraging such an adversarial regularizer for parameterizing the distribution of latent images and using gradient descent (GD) for solving the corresponding regularized optimization task leads to stability and convergence of the reconstruction compared to pixel-wise supervised learning schemes. Our simulation results verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology with limited training datasets.",

However, when using pseudo labels, there is a lack of consideration in localization precision and amplified class imbalance, both of which are critical for detection tasks. In this paper, we introduce certainty-aware pseudo labels tailored for object detection, which can effectively estimate the classification and localization quality of derived pseudo labels. This is achieved by converting conventional localization as a classification task followed by refinement. Conditioned on classification and localization quality scores, we dynamically adjust the thresholds used to generate pseudo labels and reweight loss functions for each category to alleviate the class imbalance problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method improves state-of-the-art SSOD performance by 1-2% and 4-6% AP on COCO and PASCAL VOC, respectively. In the limited-annotation regime, our approach improves supervised baselines by up to 10% AP using only 1-10% labeled data from COCO.",

While previous conformal inference methods rely on the assumption that the data points are exchangeable, our adaptive approach provably achieves the desired long-term coverage frequency irrespective of the true data generating process. We accomplish this by modelling the distribution shift as a learning problem in a single parameter whose optimal value is varying over time and must be continuously re-estimated. We test our method, adaptive conformal inference, on two real world datasets and find that its predictions are robust to visible and significant distribution shifts.",

Besides the conventional model-driven approaches, AI can also deal with the existing signal processing problems in a data-driven manner via digging the inherent characteristic from the real data. Hence, AI is particularly suitable for the signal processing problems over RIS networks under unideal scenarios like modeling mismatching, insufficient resource, hardware impairment, as well as dynamical transmissions. As one of the earliest survey papers, we will introduce the merging of AI and RIS, called AIRIS, over various signal processing topics, including environmental sensing, channel acquisition, beamforming design, and resource scheduling, etc. We will also discuss the challenges of AIRIS and present some interesting future directions.",

        "abstract": "We investigate population and individual firing behaviors in sparsely synchronized rhythms (SSRs) in a spiking neural network of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). The main encoding granule cells (GCs) are grouped into lamellar clusters. In each GC cluster, there is one inhibitory (I) basket cell (BC) along with excitatory (E) GCs, and they form the E-I loop. Winner-take-all competition, leading to sparse activation of the GCs, occurs in each GC cluster. Such sparsity has been thought to enhance pattern separation performed in the DG. During the winner-take-all competition, SSRs are found to appear in each population of the GCs and the BCs through interaction of excitation of the GCs with inhibition of the BCs. Sparsely synchronized spiking stripes appear successively with the population frequency $f_p~ (= 13$ Hz) in the raster plots of spikes. We also note that excitatory hilar mossy cells (MCs) control the firing activity of the GC-BC loop by providing excitation to both the GCs and the BCs. SSR also appears in the population of MCs via interaction with the GCs (i.e., GC-MC loop). Population behaviors in the SSRs are quantitatively characterized in terms of the synchronization measures. In addition, we investigate individual firing activity of GCs, BCs, and MCs in the SSRs. Individual GCs exhibit random spike skipping, leading to a multi-peaked inter-spike-interval histogram, which is well characterized in terms of the random phase-locking degree. On the other hand, both BCs and MCs show \"intrastripe\" burstings within stripes, together with \"interstripe\" random spike skipping. MC loss may occur during epileptogenesis. With decreasing the fraction of the MCs, changes in the population and individual firings in the SSRs are also studied. Finally, quantitative association between the population/individual firing behaviors in the SSRs and the winner-take-all competition is discussed.",

We propose and test a novel method for improving training by predicting a sparse trajectory and interpolating using constant acceleration, which improves performance for several models. This interpolation can also be used on models that aren't trained with sparse outputs, and we find that this consistently improves performance for all tested models. Additionally, we find that the accuracy of predicted trajectories for a subset of players can be improved by conditioning on the full trajectories of the other players, and that this is further improved when combined with sparse predictions. We also propose a novel architecture using graph networks and multi-head attention (GraN-MA) which achieves better performance than other tested state-of-the-art models on our dataset and is trivially adapted for both sparse trajectories and full-trajectory conditioned trajectory prediction.",

The ASIC, named ETROC and developed in a 65 nm CMOS technology, reads out a 16x16 pixel matrix of the Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (LGAD). The jitter contribution from ETROC is required to be below 40 ps to achieve the 50 ps overall time resolution per hit. The analog readout circuits in ETROC consist of the preamplifier and the discriminator. The preamplifier handles the LGAD charge signal with the most probable value of around 15 fC. The discriminator generates the digital pulse, which provides the Time-Of-Arrival (TOA, leading edge) and Time-Over-Threshold (TOT, pulse width) information. The prototype of ETROC (ETROC0) that implements a single channel of analog readout circuits has been evaluated with charge injection. The jitter of the analog readout circuits, measured from the discriminator's leading edge, is better than 16 ps for a charge larger than 15 fC with the sensor capacitance. The time walk resulting from different pulse heights can be corrected using the TOT measurement. The time resolution distribution has a standard deviation of 29 ps after the time-walk correction from the charge injection. At room temperature, the preamplifier's power consumption is measured to be 0.74 mW and 1.53 mW per pixel in the low- and high-power mode, respectively. The measured power consumption of the discriminator is 0.84 mW per pixel. With the ASIC alone or the LGAD sensor, The characterization performances fulfill the ETL's challenging requirements.",

Following human instruction, on the other hand, is the most natural way to perform artistic style transfer that can significantly improve controllability for visual effect applications. We introduce a new task -- language-driven image style transfer (\\texttt{LDIST}) -- to manipulate the style of a content image, guided by a text. We propose contrastive language visual artist (CLVA) that learns to extract visual semantics from style instructions and accomplish \\texttt{LDIST} by the patch-wise style discriminator. The discriminator considers the correlation between language and patches of style images or transferred results to jointly embed style instructions. CLVA further compares contrastive pairs of content image and style instruction to improve the mutual relativeness between transfer results. The transferred results from the same content image can preserve consistent content structures. Besides, they should present analogous style patterns from style instructions that contain similar visual semantics. The experiments show that our CLVA is effective and achieves superb transferred results on \\texttt{LDIST}.",

In the presence of strong interactions it gives rise to unconventional effective ordering of the spins leading to unprecedented spin phases: site-dependent $z\\textsf{-}x$ spin configuration with tunable (by hopping parameter) proclivity of spin alignment along $z$. Exact analysis and Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) along with stochastic minimization on Entangled Plaquette State (EPS) bestow a unique and enhanced perspective into the system beyond the scope of mean-field treatment.

Defining the ground truth for sound source localization is difficult, because the location where the sound is produced is not limited to the range of the source object, but the vibrations propagate and spread through the surrounding objects. Therefore we propose a new concept, Sounding Object, to reduce the ambiguity of the visual location of sound, making it possible to annotate the location of the wide range of sound sources. With newly proposed metrics for quantitative evaluation, we formulate the problem of Audio-Visual Sounding Object Localization (AVSOL). We also created the evaluation dataset (AVSOL-E dataset) by manually annotating the test set of well-known Audio-Visual Event (AVE) dataset. To tackle this new AVSOL problem, we propose a novel multitask training strategy and architecture called Dual Normalization Multitasking (DNM), which aggregates the Audio-Visual Correspondence (AVC) task and the classification task for video events into a single audio-visual similarity map. By efficiently utilize both supervisions by DNM, our proposed architecture significantly outperforms the baseline methods.",

However, this feature sharing mechanism inevitably causes semantic aliasing between novel classes when they have similar compositions of semantic concepts. In this paper, we reformulate few-shot segmentation as a semantic reconstruction problem, and convert base class features into a series of basis vectors which span a class-level semantic space for novel class reconstruction. By introducing contrastive loss, we maximize the orthogonality of basis vectors while minimizing semantic aliasing between classes. Within the reconstructed representation space, we further suppress interference from other classes by projecting query features to the support vector for precise semantic activation. Our proposed approach, referred to as anti-aliasing semantic reconstruction (ASR), provides a systematic yet interpretable solution for few-shot learning problems. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets show that ASR achieves strong results compared with the prior works.",

This constrains them from real-time inference on computationally restricted environments. In this paper, we propose a real-time and light-weight line segment detector for resource-constrained environments named Mobile LSD (M-LSD). We design an extremely efficient LSD architecture by minimizing the backbone network and removing the typical multi-module process for line prediction in previous methods. To maintain competitive performance with such a light-weight network, we present novel training schemes: Segments of Line segment (SoL) augmentation and geometric learning scheme. SoL augmentation splits a line segment into multiple subparts, which are used to provide auxiliary line data during the training process. Moreover, the geometric learning scheme allows a model to capture additional geometry cues from matching loss, junction and line segmentation, length and degree regression. Compared with TP-LSD-Lite, previously the best real-time LSD method, our model (M-LSD-tiny) achieves competitive performance with 2.5% of model size and an increase of 130.5% in inference speed on GPU when evaluated with Wireframe and YorkUrban datasets. Furthermore, our model runs at 56.8 FPS and 48.6 FPS on Android and iPhone mobile devices, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-time deep LSD method available on mobile devices.",

This presents new challenges for identifying interesting and important types of variability. Collecting a sufficient number of labelled data for training is difficult, however, especially in the early stages of a new survey. Here we develop a single-band light-curve classifier based on deep neural networks, and use transfer learning to address the training data paucity problem by conveying knowledge from one dataset to another. First we train a neural network on 16 variability features extracted from the light-curves of OGLE and EROS-2 variables. We then optimize this model using a small set (e.g. 5%) of periodic variable light-curves from the ASAS dataset in order to transfer knowledge inferred from OGLE/EROS-2 to a new ASAS classifier. With this we achieve good classification results on ASAS, thereby showing that knowledge can be successfully transferred between datasets. We demonstrate similar transfer learning using Hipparcos and ASAS-SN data. We therefore find that it is not necessary to train a neural network from scratch for every new survey, but rather that transfer learning can be used even when only a small set of labelled data is available in the new survey.",

        "abstract": "We present a statistical analysis for the characteristics and spatial evolution of the interplanetary discontinuities (IDs) in the solar wind, from 0.13 to 0.9 au, by using the Parker Solar Probe measurements on Orbits 4 and 5. 3948 IDs have been collected, including 2511 rotational discontinuities (RDs) and 557 tangential discontinuities (TDs), with the remnant unidentified. The statistical results show that (1) the ID occurrence rate decreases from 200 events/day at 0.13 au to 1 events/day at 0.9 au, following a spatial scaling r-2.00, (2) the RD to TD ratio decreases quickly with the heliocentric distance, from 8 at r<0.3 au to 1 at r>0.4 au, (3) the magnetic field tends to rotate across the IDs, 45\u00b0 for TDs and 30\u00b0 for RDs in the pristine solar wind within 0.3 au, (4) a special subgroup of RDs exist within 0.3 au, characterized by small field rotation angles and parallel or antiparallel propagations to the background magnetic fields, (5) the TD thicknesses normalized by local ion inertial lengths (di) show no clear spatial scaling and generally range from 5 to 35 di, and the normalized RD thicknesses follow r-1.09 spatial scaling, (6) the outward (anti-sunward) propagating RDs predominate in all RDs, with the propagation speeds in the plasma rest frame proportional to r-1.03. This work could improve our understandings for the ID characteristics and evolutions and shed light on the study of the turbulent environment in the pristine solar wind.",

As two examples, we study the DQPTs in the \\emph{XY} chains with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and \\emph{XZY-YZX} type of three-site interaction. It's found that the DQPTs may not occur in the quench across the quantum phase transitions regardless of whether the quench is from the gapless phase to gapped phase or from the gapped phase to gapless phase. This is different from the DQPTs in the case of quench from the gapped phase to gapped phase, in which the DQPTs will always appear.

However, these restrictions come with a substantial price tag. It is crucial for governments to form anti-virus strategies that balance the trade-off between protecting public health and minimizing the economic cost. This work proposes a probabilistic programming method to quantify the efficiency of major non-pharmaceutical interventions. We present a generative simulation model that accounts for the economic and human capital cost of adopting such strategies, and provide an end-to-end pipeline to simulate the virus spread and the incurred loss of various policy combinations. By investigating the national response in 10 countries covering four continents, we found that social distancing coupled with contact tracing is the most successful policy, reducing the virus transmission rate by 96\\% along with a 98\\% reduction in economic and human capital loss. Together with experimental results, we open-sourced a framework to test the efficacy of each policy combination.",

Current PyCBC-based searches for compact binary mergers, which matched filter the detector data against a set of template waveforms, have so far detected or confirmed several GW events. However, the sensitivity of these searches to signals arising from mergers of IMBH binaries is not optimal. Here, we present a new optimised PyCBC-based search for such signals. Our search benefits from using a targeted template bank, stricter signal-noise discriminators and a lower matched-filter frequency cut-off. In particular, for a population of simulated signals with isotropically distributed spins, we improve the sensitive volume-time product over previous PyCBC-based searches, at an inverse false alarm rate of 100 years, by a factor of 1.5 to 3 depending on the total binary mass. We deploy this new search on Advanced LIGO-Virgo data from the first half of the third observing run. The search does not identify any new significant IMBH binaries but does confirm the detection of the short-duration GW signal GW190521 with a false alarm rate of 1 in 727 years.",

In 1991 Schumacher forwarded a beautiful geometric approach, analogous to the well-known result of Bell, to capture non-classicality of this correlation for a singlet state. He used well-established information distance defined on an ensemble of identically-prepared states. He calculated that for certain detector settings used to measure the entangled state, the resulting geometry violated a triangle inequality -- a violation that is not possible classically. This provided a novel information-based geometric Bell inequality in terms of a \"covariance distance.\" Here we experimentally-reproduce his construction and demonstrate a definitive violation for a Bell state of two photons based on the usual spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a paired BBO crystal. The state we produced had a visibility of $V_{ad}=0.970$. We discuss generalizations to higher dimensional multipartite quantum states.",

These reduced element counts place stringent requirements on mesh quality and conformity. Our meshing algorithm is based on a Voronoi decomposition of the sphere centers. Facets of the Voronoi cells are tessellated into quads that are swept to the sphere surface to generate a high-quality base mesh. Refinements to the algorithm include edge collapse to remove slivers, node insertion to balance resolution, localized refinement in the radial direction about each sphere, and mesh optimization. We demonstrate geometries with 10^2-10^5 spheres using approximately 300 elements per sphere (for three radial layers), along with mesh quality metrics, timings, flow simulations, and solver performance.",

Then, these features are processed by a shared encoder--decoder architecture.

Policies are directly parameterized by the probability of choosing a certain action at a given state. We show that Nash equilibria (NEs) and first order stationary policies are equivalent in this setting, and give a non-asymptotic global convergence rate analysis to an $\\epsilon$-NE for a subclass of multi-agent MDPs called Markov potential games, which includes the cooperative setting with identical rewards among agents as an important special case. Our result shows that the number of iterations to reach an $\\epsilon$-NE scales linearly, instead of exponentially, with the number of agents. Local geometry and local stability are also considered. For Markov potential games, we prove that strict NEs are local maxima of the total potential function and fully-mixed NEs are saddle points. We also give a local convergence rate around strict NEs for more general settings.",

In this paper, we propose a multi-hop retrieval method, DocHopper, to answer compositional questions over long documents. At each step, DocHopper retrieves a paragraph or sentence embedding from the document, mixes the retrieved result with the query, and updates the query for the next step. In contrast to many other retrieval-based methods (e.g., RAG or REALM) the query is not augmented with a token sequence: instead, it is augmented by \"numerically\" combining it with another neural representation. This means that model is end-to-end differentiable. We demonstrate that utilizing document structure in this was can largely improve question-answering and retrieval performance on long documents. We experimented with DocHopper on three different QA tasks that require reading long documents to answer compositional questions: discourse entailment reasoning, factual QA with table and text, and information seeking QA from academic papers. DocHopper outperforms all baseline models and achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets. Additionally, DocHopper is efficient at inference time, being 3~10 times faster than the baselines.",

Setting $\\varepsilon >0$ to be the small aspect ratio of the vertical to the horizontal scales of the domain, we investigate the case when the horizontal and vertical viscosities in the incompressible three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations are of orders $O(1)$ and $O(\\varepsilon^\\alpha)$, respectively, with $\\alpha>2$, for which the limiting system is the primitive equations with only horizontal viscosity as $\\varepsilon$ tends to zero. In particular we show that for \"well prepared\" initial data the solutions of the scaled incompressible three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations converge strongly, in any finite interval of time, to the corresponding solutions of the anisotropic primitive equations with only horizontal viscosities, as $\\varepsilon$ tends to zero, and that the convergence rate is of order $O\\left(\\varepsilon^\\frac\\beta2\\right)$, where $\\beta=\\min\\{\\alpha-2,2\\}$.

Then, the boundary as well as the finite element mesh of the domain are easily updated at every time step by moving the nodal points along this velocity field. The feasibility of the method, highlighting its practicality, is illustrated through various numerical experiments. Also, in order to examine the accuracy of the proposed scheme, the experimental order of convergences between the numerical and manufactured solutions for these examples are also calculated.",

Current approaches for generative modeling have typically been limited to conventional image datasets and performed in the pixel domain which do not explicitly capture the correlation between pixels. Additionally, these approaches do not extend to scientific and other applications where each element value is continuous and is not limited to a fixed range. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating two-dimensional datasets by moving the computations to the space of representation bases and show its usefulness for two different datasets, one from imaging and another from scientific computing. The proposed approach is general and can be applied to any dataset, representation basis, or generative model. We provide a comprehensive performance comparison of various combinations of generative models and representation basis spaces. We also propose a new evaluation metric which captures the deficiency of generating images in pixel space.",

Theoretical analysis showed that uniting the two partial beams requires an extreme level of experimental control, making the proposal in its original form unrealizable in practice. In this work we revisit the above question in a numerical study concerning the possibility of partial-beam recombination in a spin-coherent manner. Using the Suzuki--Trotter numerical method of wave propagation and a configurable, approximation-free magnetic field, a simulation of a transversal Stern--Gerlach interferometer under ideal conditions is performed. The result confirms what has long been hinted at by theoretical analyses: the transversal Stern--Gerlach interferometer quantum dynamics is fundamentally irreversible even when perfect control of the associated magnetic fields and beams is assumed.",

We study a classical spin model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, easy-axis, and in-plane magnetic anisotropies on the honeycomb lattice via Monte Carlo simulations. This model could also describe the low-energy behaviors of a two-component bosonic model with a synthetic spin-orbit coupling in the deep Mott insulating region or two-dimensional materials with strong spin-orbit coupling. The results demonstrate the emergence of different sizes of spiral phases, skyrmion and vortex superlattice in absence of magnetic field, furthered the emergence of field-induced meron and skyrmion superlattice. In particular, we give the simulated evolution of the spin textures driven by the magnetic field, which could further reveal the effect of the magnetic field for inducing meron and skyrmion superlattice.",

This review provides an overview of the existing literature by developing a multi-dimensional taxonomy, which categorizes existing works based on multiple dimensions, including 1) types of games, such as differential games, stochastic games, evolutionary games, and static games; 2) types of interventions, such as social distancing, vaccination, quarantine, taking antidotes, etc.; 3) the types of decision-makers, such as individuals, adversaries, and central authorities at different hierarchical levels. A fine-grained dynamic game framework is proposed to capture the essence of game-theoretic decision-making amid epidemics. From a vast body of works, we showcase three representative works with unique ways of integrating game-theoretic decision-making into the epidemic models. The uniqueness of each of these three works distinguishes themselves from each other regarding their models, analytical approaches, and results. In the end, we identify several main open problems and research gaps left to be addressed and filled.",

Event-based learning methods have recently achieved massive success on object recognition by integrating events into dense frame-based representations to apply traditional 2D learning algorithms. However, these approaches introduce much redundant information during the sparse-to-dense conversion and necessitate models with heavy-weight and large capacities, limiting the potential of event cameras on real-life applications. To address the core problem of balancing accuracy and model complexity for event-based classification models, we (1) construct graph representations for event data to utilize their sparsity nature better and design a lightweight end-to-end graph neural network (EV-VGCNN) for classification; (2) use voxel-wise vertices rather than traditional point-wise methods to incorporate the information from more points; (3) introduce a multi-scale feature relational layer (MFRL) to extract semantic and motion cues from each vertex adaptively concerning its distances to neighbors. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach advances state-of-the-art classification accuracy while achieving nearly 20 times parameter reduction (merely 0.84M parameters).",

Among these, Bluetooth trackers are becoming popular as they allow users to track the location of their physical objects. To do so, Bluetooth trackers are often built-in within other commercial products connected to a larger crowdsourced tracking system. Such a system, however, can pose a threat to the security and privacy of the users, for instance, by revealing the location of a user's valuable object. In this paper, we introduce a set of security properties and investigate the state of commercial crowdsourced tracking systems, which present common design flaws that make them insecure. Leveraging the results of our investigation, we propose a new design for a secure crowdsourced tracking system (SECrow), which allows devices to leverage the benefits of the crowdsourced model without sacrificing security and privacy. Our preliminary evaluation shows that SECrow is a practical, secure, and effective crowdsourced tracking solution",

In training, they predict conditioned on the golden intermediate results, while at inference relying on the model output of the previous steps, which introduces exposure bias. To solve this problem, we first construct a segment graph for each sentence, in which each node denotes a segment (a continuous entity on its own, or a part of discontinuous entities), and an edge links two nodes that belong to the same entity. The nodes and edges can be generated respectively in one stage with a grid tagging scheme and learned jointly using a novel architecture named Mac. Then discontinuous NER can be reformulated as a non-parametric process of discovering maximal cliques in the graph and concatenating the spans in each clique. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, with up to 3.5 percentage points improvement on F1, and achieves 5x speedup over the SOTA model.",

An important contributor to the success rates of these systems is their ability to fully understand the consumers' questions. However, these questions are frequently longer than needed and mention peripheral information that is not useful in finding relevant answers. Question summarization is one of the potential solutions to simplifying long and complex consumer questions before attempting to find an answer. In this paper, we study the task of abstractive summarization for real-world consumer health questions. We develop an abstractive question summarization model that leverages the semantic interpretation of a question via recognition of medical entities, which enables the generation of informative summaries. Towards this, we propose multiple Cloze tasks (i.e. the task of filing missing words in a given context) to identify the key medical entities that enforce the model to have better coverage in question-focus recognition. Additionally, we infuse the decoder inputs with question-type information to generate question-type driven summaries. When evaluated on the MeQSum benchmark corpus, our framework outperformed the state-of-the-art method by 10.2 ROUGE-L points. We also conducted a manual evaluation to assess the correctness of the generated summaries.",

These triangulations have emerged as a powerful tool for robust geometry processing of surface meshes, taking a low-quality mesh and retriangulating it with high-quality intrinsic triangles. However, existing representations either support only edge flips, or do not offer a robust procedure to recover the common subdivision, that is, how the intrinsic triangulation sits along the original surface. To build a general-purpose robust structure, we extend the framework of normal coordinates, which have been deeply studied in topology, as well as the more recent idea of roundabouts from geometry processing, to support a variety of mesh processing operations like vertex insertions, edge splits, etc. The basic idea is to store an integer per mesh edge counting the number of times a curve crosses that edge. We show that this paradigm offers a highly effective representation for intrinsic triangulations with strong robustness guarantees. The resulting data structure is general and efficient, while offering a guarantee of always encoding a valid subdivision. Among other things, this allows us to generate a high-quality intrinsic Delaunay refinement of all manifold meshes in the challenging Thingi10k dataset for the first time. This enables a broad class of existing surface geometry algorithms to be applied out-of-the-box to low-quality triangulations.",

        "abstract": "Large-batch training has become a commonly used technique when training neural networks with a large number of GPU/TPU processors. As batch size increases, stochastic optimizers tend to converge to sharp local minima, leading to degraded test performance. Current methods usually use extensive data augmentation to increase the batch size, but we found the performance gain with data augmentation decreases as batch size increases, and data augmentation will become insufficient after certain point. In this paper, we propose to use adversarial learning to increase the batch size in large-batch training. Despite being a natural choice for smoothing the decision surface and biasing towards a flat region, adversarial learning has not been successfully applied in large-batch training since it requires at least two sequential gradient computations at each step, which will at least double the running time compared with vanilla training even with a large number of processors. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel Concurrent Adversarial Learning (ConAdv) method that decouple the sequential gradient computations in adversarial learning by utilizing staled parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that ConAdv can successfully increase the batch size on both ResNet-50 and EfficientNet training on ImageNet while maintaining high accuracy. In particular, we show ConAdv along can achieve 75.3\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet ResNet-50 training with 96K batch size, and the accuracy can be further improved to 76.2\\% when combining ConAdv with data augmentation. This is the first work successfully scales ResNet-50 training batch size to 96K.",

        "abstract": "Crucial for building trust in deep learning models for critical real-world applications is efficient and theoretically sound uncertainty quantification, a task that continues to be challenging. Useful uncertainty information is expected to have two key properties: It should be valid (guaranteeing coverage) and discriminative (more uncertain when the expected risk is high). Moreover, when combined with deep learning (DL) methods, it should be scalable and affect the DL model performance minimally. Most existing Bayesian methods lack frequentist coverage guarantees and usually affect model performance. The few available frequentist methods are rarely discriminative and/or violate coverage guarantees due to unrealistic assumptions. Moreover, many methods are expensive or require substantial modifications to the base neural network. Building upon recent advances in conformal prediction and leveraging the classical idea of kernel regression, we propose Locally Valid and Discriminative confidence intervals (LVD), a simple, efficient and lightweight method to construct discriminative confidence intervals (CIs) for almost any DL model. With no assumptions on the data distribution, such CIs also offer finite-sample local coverage guarantees (contrasted to the simpler marginal coverage). Using a diverse set of datasets, we empirically verify that besides being the only locally valid method, LVD also exceeds or matches the performance (including coverage rate and prediction accuracy) of existing uncertainty quantification methods, while offering additional benefits in scalability and flexibility.",

One major trouble regarding this class of PDEs concerns its mathematical nature, which may be nonuniform over the domain. Due to the local degeneracy of the diffusion term, it can be purely hyperbolic in a subregion and elliptic in the rest. This problem is thus quite delicate to solve since the exact solution is discontinuous at interfaces separating both elliptic and hyperbolic parts. The proposed HDG method is developed in a unified and compact fashion. It can efficiently handle pure diffusive or advective regimes and intermediate regimes that combine the above mechanisms for a wide range of P\u00e9clet numbers, including the delicate situation of local evanescent diffusion. To this end, an adaptive stabilization strategy based on the addition of jump-penalty terms is then considered. A $\\theta$-upwind-based scheme is favored for the hyperbolic region, and an inspired Scharfetter--Gummel-based technique is preferred for the elliptic region. The well-posedness of the HDG method is also discussed by analyzing the consistency and discrete coercivity properties. Extensive numerical experiments are finally considered to verify the model's robustness for all the abovementioned regimes.",

However, existing local aggregation operators in the current literature fail to attach decent importance to the local information of the point cloud, which limits the power of the models. To fit this gap, we propose an efficient Vector Attention Convolution module (VAConv), which utilizes K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to extract the neighbor points of each input point, and then uses the elevation and azimuth relationship of the vectors between the center point and its neighbors to construct an attention weight matrix for edge features. Afterwards, the VAConv adopts a dual-channel structure to fuse weighted edge features and global features. To verify the efficiency of the VAConv, we connect the VAConvs with different receptive fields in parallel to obtain a Multi-scale graph convolutional network, VA-GCN. The proposed VA-GCN achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks including ModelNet40, S3DIS and ShapeNet. Remarkably, on the ModelNet40 dataset for 3D classification, VA-GCN increased by 2.4% compared to the baseline.",

Capacity has non-trivial time evolution and is sensitive to the partial entanglement structure, and shows a universal peak at early times. We define a quantity, the \"rate of capacity\" which measures how fast the capacity reaches its peak. This quantity turns out to be a characteristic property of the inserted operator. This firmly establishes capacity as a valuable measure of entanglement structure of an operator, especially at early times similar in spirit to the Renyi entropies at late times. Interestingly, the time evolution of capacity closely resembles its evolution in microcanonical and canonical ensemble of the replica wormhole model in the context of the black hole information paradox.",

The slow or lack of improvements for public transportation pushes people to use private transportation modes, such as carpooling and ridesharing. However, the occupancy rate of personal vehicles has been dropping in many cities. In this paper, we propose a centralized transit system that integrates public transit and ridesharing, which is capable of matching drivers and public transit riders such that the riders would result in shorter travel time. The optimization goal of the system is to assign as many riders to drivers as possible for ridesharing. We describe an exact approach and approximation algorithms to achieve the optimization goal. We conduct an extensive computational study to show the effectiveness of the transit system for different approximation algorithms. Our experiments are based on the real-world traffic data in Chicago City; the data sets include both public transit and ridesharing trip information. The experiment results show that our system is able to assign more than 60% of riders to drivers, leading to a substantial increase in occupancy rate of personal vehicles and reducing riders' travel time.",

        "abstract": "People who are involved with political campaigns face increased digital security threats from well-funded, sophisticated attackers, especially nation-states. Improving political campaign security is a vital part of protecting democracy. To identify campaign security issues, we conducted qualitative research with 28 participants across the U.S. political spectrum to understand the digital security practices, challenges, and perceptions of people involved in campaigns. A main, overarching finding is that a unique combination of threats, constraints, and work culture lead people involved with political campaigns to use technologies from across platforms and domains in ways that leave them--and democracy--vulnerable to security attacks. Sensitive data was kept in a plethora of personal and work accounts, with ad hoc adoption of strong passwords, two-factor authentication, encryption, and access controls. No individual company, committee, organization, campaign, or academic institution can solve the identified problems on their own. To this end, we provide an initial understanding of this complex problem space and recommendations for how a diverse group of experts can begin working together to improve security for political campaigns.",

Given the enormous volume of content posted daily, human monitoring of hate speech is unfeasible. In this work, we propose new word-level features for automatic hate speech detection (HSD): multiword expressions (MWEs). MWEs are lexical units greater than a word that have idiomatic and compositional meanings. We propose to integrate MWE features in a deep neural network-based HSD framework. Our baseline HSD system relies on Universal Sentence Encoder (USE). To incorporate MWE features, we create a three-branch deep neural network: one branch for USE, one for MWE categories, and one for MWE embeddings. We conduct experiments on two hate speech tweet corpora with different MWE categories and with two types of MWE embeddings, word2vec and BERT. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed HSD system with MWE features significantly outperforms the baseline system in terms of macro-F1.",

We then implement the (3+1) dimensional viscous hydrodynamic model to study the spin polarizations from these sources with a small chemical potential and ignorance of electromagnetic fields. Although the shear correction alone upon local polarization results in the sign and azimuthal-angle dependence more consistent with experimental observations, as also discovered in other recent studies, it is mostly suppressed by the contributions from thermal vorticity and other terms that yield an opposite trend. It is found that the total local spin polarization could be very sensitive to the equation of states, the ratio of shear viscosity over entropy density, and freezeout temperature.",

A recent research line has explored the possibility of even offloading to the data plane part of Artificial Intelligence algorithms, and more specifically, Machine Learning ones, to increase their accuracy and responsiveness (by having more detailed visibility of the traffic). This introduces a significant opportunity for evolution in the critical field of Intrusion Detection. However, offloading functionalities to the data plane is not a straightforward task. In this paper, we discuss how Programmable Data Planes might complement different stages of an Intrusion Detection System based on Machine Learning. We present two use cases that make evident the feasibility of this approach and highlight aspects that must be considered when addressing the challenge of deploying solutions leveraging data-plane functionalities.",

        "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental component in many applications, such as Web Search and Voice Assistants. Although deep neural networks greatly improve the performance of NER, due to the requirement of large amounts of training data, deep neural networks can hardly scale out to many languages in an industry setting. To tackle this challenge, cross-lingual NER transfers knowledge from a rich-resource language to languages with low resources through pre-trained multilingual language models. Instead of using training data in target languages, cross-lingual NER has to rely on only training data in source languages, and optionally adds the translated training data derived from source languages. However, the existing cross-lingual NER methods do not make good use of rich unlabeled data in target languages, which is relatively easy to collect in industry applications. To address the opportunities and challenges, in this paper we describe our novel practice in Microsoft to leverage such large amounts of unlabeled data in target languages in real production settings. To effectively extract weak supervision signals from the unlabeled data, we develop a novel approach based on the ideas of semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning. The empirical study on three benchmark data sets verifies that our approach establishes the new state-of-the-art performance with clear edges. Now, the NER techniques reported in this paper are on their way to become a fundamental component for Web ranking, Entity Pane, Answers Triggering, and Question Answering in the Microsoft Bing search engine. Moreover, our techniques will also serve as part of the Spoken Language Understanding module for a commercial voice assistant. We plan to open source the code of the prototype framework after deployment.",

Some have slow dynamics while some have fast dynamics. A novel three step PS3 algorithm which is presented in our prequel paper is used to obtain a near-optimal solution. PS3 algorithm makes use of pseudo spectral method for accurate state estimations. We present three scenarios where only fuel is minimized, only emissions are minimized and, lastly a combination of both fuel and emissions are minimized.

This divides the trivectors into three groups: nilpotent, semisimple, and mixed trivectors. Our classification follows the same pattern. We use Galois cohomology to obtain the classification over R. For the nilpotent orbits this is in principle rather straightforward and the main problem is to determine the first Galois cohomology sets of a long list of centralizers (we compute the centralizers using computer). For the semisimple and mixed orbits we develop new methods based on Galois cohomology, first and second. We also consider real theta-representations in general, and derive a number of results that are useful for the classification of their orbits.",

In contrast to this, Markov Chains are a state-based analysis technique based on a stochastic model. But the use of Markov Chains for failure analysis of complex safety-critical systems is limited due to exponential explosion of the size of the model. In this paper, we present a concept to integrate Markov Chains in Component Fault Tree models. Based on a component concept for Markov Chains, which enables the association of Markov Chains to system development elements such as components, complex or software-controlled systems can be analyzed w.r.t. safety or reliability in a modular and compositional way. We illustrate this approach using a case study from the automotive domain.",

Understanding tables is a challenging problem that requires an understanding of language and table structure, along with numerical and logical reasoning. In this paper, we present our systems to solve Task 9 of SemEval-2021: Statement Verification and Evidence Finding with Tables (SEM-TAB-FACTS). The task consists of two subtasks: (A) Given a table and a statement, predicting whether the table supports the statement and (B) Predicting which cells in the table provide evidence for/against the statement. We fine-tune TAPAS (a model which extends BERT's architecture to capture tabular structure) for both the subtasks as it has shown state-of-the-art performance in various table understanding tasks. In subtask A, we evaluate how transfer learning and standardizing tables to have a single header row improves TAPAS' performance. In subtask B, we evaluate how different fine-tuning strategies can improve TAPAS' performance. Our systems achieve an F1 score of 67.34 in subtask A three-way classification, 72.89 in subtask A two-way classification, and 62.95 in subtask B.",

Under a Bayesian formulation, assuming a well-specified model, the two contributions can be exactly expressed (for the log-loss) or bounded (for more general losses) in terms of information-theoretic quantities (Xu and Raginsky, 2020). This paper addresses the study of epistemic uncertainty within an information-theoretic framework in the broader setting of Bayesian meta-learning. A general hierarchical Bayesian model is assumed in which hyperparameters determine the per-task priors of the model parameters. Exact characterizations (for the log-loss) and bounds (for more general losses) are derived for the epistemic uncertainty - quantified by the minimum excess meta-risk (MEMR)- of optimal meta-learning rules. This characterization is leveraged to bring insights into the dependence of the epistemic uncertainty on the number of tasks and on the amount of per-task training data. Experiments are presented that compare the proposed information-theoretic bounds, evaluated via neural mutual information estimators, with the performance of a novel approximate fully Bayesian meta-learning strategy termed Langevin-Stein Bayesian Meta-Learning (LS-BML).",

The operation of power systems, especially distribution network (DN), is facing with preeminent challenges from cyber-physical-human (CPH) threats and natural disasters. In order to provide better response against threats and improve the resilience of power grid, proactive plans and operational schemes are required by system operators to minimize the damages caused by CPH threats. To that end, this paper proposes a proactive plan for DN operation by using hydrogen (H2) systems to enhance the resilience through cost-effective long-term energy storage. Unlike batteries, H2 energy can be stored in the storage tanks days before the extreme event, and transformed into power by fuel cell units in the post-event time to reduce load curtailment caused by CPH threats. The proposed framework is validated by testing on 33-node test feeder. Simulation results demonstrate that H2 systems can improve the resilience of DN during $N-m$ outages lasting for more than 10 hours.",

Different from the existing works that focus on transceiver design of AirComp over static networks, this paper considers an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided AirComp system, where the UAV as a flying base station aggregates data from mobile sensors. The trajectory design of the UAV provides an additional degree of freedom to improve the performance of AirComp. Our goal is to minimize the time-averaged mean-squared error (MSE) of AirComp by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, receive normalizing factors, and sensors' transmit power. To this end, we first propose a novel and equivalent problem transformation by introducing intermediate variables. This reformulation leads to a convex subproblem when fixing any other two blocks of variables, thereby enabling efficient algorithm design based on the principle of block coordinate descent and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) techniques. In particular, we derive the optimal closed-form solutions for normalizing factors and intermediate variables optimization subproblems. We also recast the convex trajectory design subproblem into an ADMM form and obtain the closed-form expressions for each variable updating. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a smaller time-averaged MSE while reducing the simulation time by orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.",

However, there are still various challenges of image classifications in practice, such as classifying noisy image or image-set queries and training deep image classification models over the limited-scale dataset. Instead of applying generic deep features, the model-based approaches can be more effective and data-efficient for robust image and image-set classification tasks, as various image priors are exploited for modeling the inter- and intra-set data variations while preventing over-fitting. In this work, we propose a novel Joint Statistical and Spatial Sparse representation, dubbed \\textit{J3S}, to model the image or image-set data for classification, by reconciling both their local patch structures and global Gaussian distribution mapped into Riemannian manifold. To the best of our knowledge, no work to date utilized both global statistics and local patch structures jointly via joint sparse representation. We propose to solve the joint sparse coding problem based on the J3S model, by coupling the local and global image representations using joint sparsity. The learned J3S models are used for robust image and image-set classification. Experiments show that the proposed J3S-based image classification scheme outperforms the popular or state-of-the-art competing methods over FMD, UIUC, ETH-80 and YTC databases.",

The proposed architecture consists of (i) a perceptive module that extracts a hierarchical and temporally consistent representation of the observation at multiple levels, (ii) a deductive module for determining the relational connection between neurons at each level, and (iii) a statistical module that can predict the future by conditioning on the temporal distributional estimation.

Our preconditioning strategy is a generalization of the physics-based preconditioning methods in [Chacon, et al, JCP 2002] to adaptive, stabilized finite elements. Algebraic multigrid methods are used to invert sub-block operators to achieve scalability. A parallel adaptive mesh refinement scheme with dynamic load-balancing is implemented to efficiently resolve the multi-scale spatial features of the system. Our implementation uses the MFEM framework, which provides arbitrary-order polynomials and flexible adaptive conforming and non-conforming meshes capabilities. Results demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of the implicit scheme in the presence of large scale disparity. The potential of the AMR approach is demonstrated on an island coalescence problem in the high Lundquist-number regime ($\\ge 10^7$) with the successful resolution of plasmoid instabilities and thin current sheets.",

As a consequence of these two facts, electric currents can only flow near the surface of a type I superconducting wire so that the self-field vanishes in the interior. Here we examine how an electric current flowing through the entire cross-section of a normal conducting wire becomes a surface current when it enters a superconducting portion of the wire. This geometry provides insight into the dynamics of magnetic flux expulsion that is not apparent in the Meissner effect involving expulsion of an externally applied magnetic field. It provides clear evidence that the motion of magnetic field lines in superconductors is intimately tied to the motion of charge carriers, as occurs in classical plasmas (Alfven's theorem) and as proposed in the theory of hole superconductivity \\cite{holesc}, in contradiction with the conventional London-BCS theory of superconductivity.",

However, most of these methods either neglect the exercise-specific characteristics (e.g., exercise materials), or cannot fully explore the high-order interactions between students, exercises, as well as knowledge concepts. To this end, we propose a Graph-based Exercise- and Knowledge-Aware Learning Network for accurate student score prediction. Specifically, we learn students' mastery of exercises and knowledge concepts respectively to model the two-fold effects of exercises and knowledge concepts. Then, to model the high-order interactions, we apply graph convolution techniques in the prediction process.

However, an open problem in T-ZSL: how to effectively make use of unseen-class samples for training, still remains. Addressing this problem, we first empirically analyze the roles of unseen-class samples with different degrees of hardness in the training process based on the uneven prediction phenomenon found in many ZSL methods, resulting in three observations. Then, we propose two hardness sampling approaches for selecting a subset of diverse and hard samples from a given unseen-class dataset according to these observations. The first one identifies the samples based on the class-level frequency of the model predictions while the second enhances the former by normalizing the class frequency via an approximate class prior estimated by an explored prior estimation algorithm. Finally, we design a new Self-Training framework with Hardness Sampling for T-ZSL, called STHS, where an arbitrary inductive ZSL method could be seamlessly embedded and it is iteratively trained with unseen-class samples selected by the hardness sampling approach. We introduce two typical ZSL methods into the STHS framework and extensive experiments demonstrate that the derived T-ZSL methods outperform many state-of-the-art methods on three public benchmarks. Besides, we note that the unseen-class dataset is separately used for training in some existing transductive generalized ZSL (T-GZSL) methods, which is not strict for a GZSL task. Hence, we suggest a more strict T-GZSL data setting and establish a competitive baseline on this setting by introducing the proposed STHS framework to T-GZSL.",

        "abstract": "Object orientation has become the predominant paradigm for conceptual modeling (e.g., UML), where the notions of class and object form the primitive building blocks of thought. Classes act as templates for objects that have attributes and methods (actions). The modeled systems are not even necessarily software systems: They can be human and artificial systems of many different kinds (e.g., teaching and learning systems). The UML class diagram is described as a central component of model-driven software development. It is the most common diagram in object-oriented models and used to model the static design view of a system. Objects both carry data and execute actions. According to some authorities in modeling, a certain degree of difficulty exists in understanding the semantics of these notions in UML class diagrams. Some researchers claim class diagrams have limited use for conceptual analysis and that they are best used for logical design. Performing conceptual analysis should not concern the ways facts are grouped into structures. Whether a fact will end up in the design as an attribute is not a conceptual issue. UML leads to drilling down into physical design details (e.g., private/public attributes, encapsulated operations, and navigating direction of an association). This paper is a venture to further the understanding of object-orientated concepts as exemplified in UML with the aim of developing a broad comprehension of conceptual modeling fundamentals. Thinging machine (TM) modeling is a new modeling language employed in such an undertaking. TM modeling interlaces structure (components) and actionality where actions infiltrate the attributes as much as the classes. Although space limitations affect some aspects of the class diagram, the concluding assessment of this study reveals the class description is a kind of shorthand for a richer sematic TM construct.",

In this study, a field test was implemented on the M3 generation of two mutant pea plants gained from previous neutron radiation of pea seeds. The relationship between agronomic characteristics and yields of the mutants was investigated. Moreover, differences in physiological and biochemical properties and seed nutrients were analyzed. The results demonstrated that the plant height, effective pods per plant, and yield per plant of mutant Leaf-M1 were 45.0%, 43.2%, and 50.9% higher than those of the control group. Further analysis attributed the increase in yield per plant to the increased branching number. The yield per plant of mutant Leaf-M2 was 7.8% higher than that of the control group, which could be related with the increased chlorophyll content in the leaves. There was a significant difference between the two mutants in the increase of yield per plant owing to morphological variation between the two mutants. There were significant differences in SOD activity and MDA content between the two mutants and the control, indicating that the physiological regulation of the two mutants also changed. In addition, the iron element content of seeds of the two mutants were about 10.9% lower than in the seeds of the control group, a significant difference. These findings indicate that the mutants Leaf-M1 and Leaf-M2 have breeding value and material value for molecular biological studies.",

Great efforts have been dedicated to defending ASV against replay and synthetic speech; however, only a few approaches have been explored to deal with adversarial attacks. All the existing approaches to tackle adversarial attacks for ASV require the knowledge for adversarial samples generation, but it is impractical for defenders to know the exact attack algorithms that are applied by the in-the-wild attackers. This work is among the first to perform adversarial defense for ASV without knowing the specific attack algorithms. Inspired by self-supervised learning models (SSLMs) that possess the merits of alleviating the superficial noise in the inputs and reconstructing clean samples from the interrupted ones, this work regards adversarial perturbations as one kind of noise and conducts adversarial defense for ASV by SSLMs. Specifically, we propose to perform adversarial defense from two perspectives: 1) adversarial perturbation purification and 2) adversarial perturbation detection. Experimental results show that our detection module effectively shields the ASV by detecting adversarial samples with an accuracy of around 80%. Moreover, since there is no common metric for evaluating the adversarial defense performance for ASV, this work also formalizes evaluation metrics for adversarial defense considering both purification and detection based approaches into account. We sincerely encourage future works to benchmark their approaches based on the proposed evaluation framework.",

However, simultaneously achieving all the goals is extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called hierarchical federated learning (H-FL) to tackle this challenge. Considering the degradation of the model performance due to the statistic heterogeneity of the training data, we devise a runtime distribution reconstruction strategy, which reallocates the clients appropriately and utilizes mediators to rearrange the local training of the clients. In addition, we design a compression-correction mechanism incorporated into H-FL to reduce the communication overhead while not sacrificing the model performance. To further provide privacy guarantees, we introduce differential privacy while performing local training, which injects moderate amount of noise into only part of the complete model. Experimental results show that our H-FL framework achieves the state-of-art performance on different datasets for the real-world image recognition tasks.",

Furthermore, due to the absence of clear new-physics signals, precise theoretical calculations are required in order to pin down possible subtle deviations from the Standard Model predictions. The error associated with such calculations must be scrutinized, as non-perturbative power corrections, dubbed infrared renormalons, can limit the ultimate precision of truncated perturbative expansions in quantum chromodynamics. In this review we focus on linear power corrections that can arise in certain kinematic distributions relevant for collider phenomenology where an operator product expansion is missing, e.g. those obtained from the top-quark decay products, shape observables and the transverse momentum of massive gauge bosons. Only the last one is found to be free from such corrections, while the mass of the system comprising the top decay products has a larger power correction if the perturbative expansion is expressed in terms of a short-distance mass instead of the pole mass. A proper modelization of non-perturbative corrections is crucial in the context of shape observables to obtain reliable strong coupling constant extractions.",

For arbitrary ordinal labels the criterion is maximizing the number of labels which are only changed to an adjacent label (and recursively apply this). For real-valued labels we minimize the $L_p$ error. For linearly ordered sets we also give algorithms which minimize the sum of the $L_p$ and weighted $L_0$ errors, a form of penalized (regularized) regression.

We then use a radiation transfer post-processing model for one of the spiral galaxies produced by the Auriga cosmological zoom simulations to investigate the effect of spatial discretization on the synthetic observations. We find that the calculated Lyman-alpha line profiles exhibit an extraordinarily strong dependence on the type and resolution of the spatial grid, rendering the results untrustworthy at best. We attribute this effect to the large gradients in the hydrogen density distribution over small distances, which remain significantly under-resolved in the input model.

This model is reduced from the two-phase Baer-Nunziato model in the limit of complete velocity relaxation and consists of the phase mass and energy balance equations, the mixture momentum equation, and a transport equation for the volume fraction.Terms describing effects of mechanical relaxation, temperature relaxation, and thermal conduction on volume fraction evolution are derived and demonstrated to be significant for heat conduction problems. The thermal conduction leads to instantaneous thermal relaxation so that the temperature equilibrium is always maintained in the interface region with meeting the entropy relations. A numerical method is developed to solve the model governing equations that ensures the pressure-velocity-temperature (PVT) equilibrium condition in its high-order extension. We solve the hyperbolic part of the governing equations with the Godunov method with the HLLC approximate Riemann solver. The non-linear parabolic part is solved with an efficient Chebyshev explicit iterative method without dealing with large sparse matrices. To verify the model and numerical methods proposed,we demonstrate numerical results of several numerical tests such as the multiphase shock tube problem, the multiphase impact problem, and the planar ablative Rayleigh-Taylor instability problem.",

In this paper, we propose an approach based on mixed frequency models to overcome the lack of information caused by temporal aggregation.

However, global or block Lanczos-type solvers often exhibit large oscillations in the residual norms and may have a large residual gap relating to the loss of attainable accuracy of the approximations. Conventional residual smoothing schemes suppress the oscillations but do not aid in improving the attainable accuracy, whereas a novel residual smoothing scheme enables the attainable accuracy for single right-hand side Lanczos-type solvers to be improved. The underlying concept of this scheme is that the primary and smoothed sequences of the approximations and residuals influence one another, thereby avoiding the severe propagation of rounding errors. In the present study, we extend this cross-interactive residual smoothing to the case of solving linear systems with multiple right-hand sides. The resulting smoothed methods can reduce the residual gap with few additional costs compared to their original counterparts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through rounding error analysis and numerical experiments.",

        "abstract": "Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has been a popular paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) settings and is widely used in many real applications. One of the major challenges in the training process is credit assignment, which aims to deduce the contributions of each agent according to the global rewards. Existing credit assignment methods focus on either decomposing the joint value function into individual value functions or measuring the impact of local observations and actions on the global value function. These approaches lack a thorough consideration of the complicated interactions among multiple agents, leading to an unsuitable assignment of credit and subsequently mediocre results on MARL. We propose Shapley Counterfactual Credit Assignment, a novel method for explicit credit assignment which accounts for the coalition of agents. Specifically, Shapley Value and its desired properties are leveraged in deep MARL to credit any combinations of agents, which grants us the capability to estimate the individual credit for each agent. Despite this capability, the main technical difficulty lies in the computational complexity of Shapley Value who grows factorially as the number of agents. We instead utilize an approximation method via Monte Carlo sampling, which reduces the sample complexity while maintaining its effectiveness. We evaluate our method on StarCraft II benchmarks across different scenarios. Our method outperforms existing cooperative MARL algorithms significantly and achieves the state-of-the-art, with especially large margins on tasks with more severe difficulties.",

We build on this to show that the BW metric is a more suitable and robust choice for several Riemannian optimization problems over ill-conditioned SPD matrices. We show that the BW geometry has a non-negative curvature, which further improves convergence rates of algorithms over the non-positively curved AI geometry.

The method also utilizes information from the motion dynamics experienced by the system to manipulate parameters online.

PSD factorizations are fundamentally linked to understanding the expressiveness of semidefinite programs as well as the power and limitations of quantum resources in information theory. The PSD factorization task generalizes the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) problem where we seek a collection of $r$-dimensional nonnegative vectors $\\{a_i\\}$ and $\\{b_j\\}$ satisfying $X_{ij}= a_i^\\top b_j$, for all $i\\in [m],\\ j\\in [n]$ -- one can recover the latter problem by choosing matrices in the PSD factorization to be diagonal. The most widely used algorithm for computing NMFs of a matrix is the Multiplicative Update algorithm developed by Lee and Seung, in which nonnegativity of the updates is preserved by scaling with positive diagonal matrices. In this paper, we describe a non-commutative extension of Lee-Seung's algorithm, which we call the Matrix Multiplicative Update (MMU) algorithm, for computing PSD factorizations. The MMU algorithm ensures that updates remain PSD by congruence scaling with the matrix geometric mean of appropriate PSD matrices, and it retains the simplicity of implementation that Lee-Seung's algorithm enjoys. Building on the Majorization-Minimization framework, we show that under our update scheme the squared loss objective is non-increasing and fixed points correspond to critical points. The analysis relies on Lieb's Concavity Theorem. Beyond PSD factorizations, we use the MMU algorithm as a primitive to calculate block-diagonal PSD factorizations and tensor PSD factorizations.

The Seeley-DeWitt coefficients of this decomposition satisfy a set of recurrence relations, which we use to construct two function families of a special kind. Using these functions, we find the expansion of a heat kernel for the inverse Laplace operator for an arbitrary dimension of space. We show that the new functions have some important properties. For example, we can consider the Laplace operator on the function set as a shift one. Also we describe various applications useful in theoretical physics and, in particular, we find the decomposition of Green functions in terms of new functions.",

In this way, considerable energy savings could be achieved by enhancing household's awareness of energy usage. Recent investigations have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) based approaches are promising for the NILM task. Nevertheless, they normally ignore the inherent properties of appliance operations in the network design, potentially leading to implausible results. We are thus motivated to develop the dual Deep Neural Networks (dual-DNN), which aims to i) take advantage of DNNs' learning capability of latent features and ii) empower the DNN architecture with identification ability of universal properties. Specifically in the design of dual-DNN, we adopt one subnetwork to measure power ratings of different appliances' operation states, and the other subnetwork to identify the running states of target appliances. The final result is then obtained by multiplying these two network outputs and meanwhile considering the multi-state property of household appliances. To enforce the sparsity property in appliance's state operating, we employ median filtering and hard gating mechanisms to the subnetwork for state identification. Compared with the state-of-the-art NILM methods, our dual-DNN approach demonstrates a 21.67% performance improvement in average on two public benchmark datasets.",

In the cases of non-chiral asymmetric-top molecules excited by an orthogonally polarized two-color pulse, we demonstrate, classically and quantum mechanically, three-dimensional orientation. For chiral molecules, we show that the orientation induced by a cross-polarized two-color pulse is enantioselective along the laser propagation direction, namely, the two enantiomers are oriented in opposite directions. On the short time scale, the classical and quantum simulations give results that are in excellent agreement, whereas on the longer time scale, the enantioselective orientation exhibits quantum beats. These observations are qualitatively explained by analyzing the interaction potential between the two-color pulse and molecular (hyper-)polarizability. The prospects for utilizing the long-lasting orientation for measuring and using the enantioselective orientation for separating the individual enantiomers are discussed.",

However, the corresponding performance under physical models has not been explored; in particular it remains unclear whether link-level power control and scheduling can improve the asymptotic performance. This paper thus investigates the throughput-outage scaling laws of cache-aided single-hop D2D networks considering a general physical channel model. By considering the networks with and without the equal-throughput assumption, we analyze the corresponding outer bounds and provide the achievable performance analysis. Results show that when the equal-throughput assumption is considered, using link-level power control and scheduling cannot improve the scaling laws. On the other hand, when the equal-throughput assumption is not considered, we show that the proposed double time-slot framework with appropriate link-level power control and scheduling can significantly improve the throughput-outage scaling laws, where the fundamental concept is to first distinguish links according to their communication distances, and then enhance the throughput for links with small communication distances.",

First, they generalize the well-known (1, k)-configuration inequalities. Second, they are not aggregation cuts. Third, they cannot be generated as a rank-1 Chvatal-Gomory cut from the inequality system consisting of the knapsack constraints and all their minimal cover inequalities. We also provide conditions under which the inequalities are facets for the convex hull of the totally-ordered knapsack set, as well as conditions for those inequalities to fully characterize its convex hull. We give an integer program to solve the separation and provide numerical experiments that showcase the strength of these new inequalities.",

To be able to deal with underspecified datasets while still leveraging contextual clues during classification, we propose ProtoProp, a novel prototype propagation graph method. First we learn prototypical representations of objects (e.g., zebra) that are conditionally independent w.r.t. their attribute labels (e.g., stripes) and vice versa. Next we propagate the independent prototypes through a compositional graph, to learn compositional prototypes of novel attribute-object combinations that reflect the dependencies of the target distribution. The method does not rely on any external data, such as class hierarchy graphs or pretrained word embeddings. We evaluate our approach on AO-Clever, a synthetic and strongly visual dataset with clean labels, and UT-Zappos, a noisy real-world dataset of fine-grained shoe types. We show that in the generalized compositional zero-shot setting we outperform state-of-the-art results, and through ablations we show the importance of each part of the method and their contribution to the final results.",

Thus, its measurement has lately drawn the attention of researchers and policy-makers. During the last years, novel digital data streams have drastically changed the research in this field. In the current study, we exploit information extracted from Global Data on Events, Location, and Tone (GDELT) digital news database, to capture peacefulness through the Global Peace Index (GPI). Applying predictive machine learning models, we demonstrate that news media attention from GDELT can be used as a proxy for measuring GPI at a monthly level. Additionally, we use the SHAP methodology to obtain the most important variables that drive the predictions. This analysis highlights each country's profile and provides explanations for the predictions overall, and particularly for the errors and the events that drive these errors. We believe that digital data exploited by Social Good researchers, policy-makers, and peace-builders, with data science tools as powerful as machine learning, could contribute to maximize the societal benefits and minimize the risks to peacefulness.",

In this study, the effect of weekend curfews on reducing the spread of a contagious disease, such as COVID-19, is modeled using a Monte Carlo algorithm with a hybrid lattice model. In the simulation setup, a fictional country with three towns and 26,610 citizens were used as a model.

In this paper, we study (i) a sparsity-constrained version of the problem, in which the testing procedure is subjected to one of the following two constraints: items are finitely divisible and thus may participate in at most $\\gamma$ tests; or tests are size-constrained to pool no more than $\\rho$ items per test; and (ii) a noisy version of the problem, where each test outcome is independently flipped with some constant probability. Under each of these settings, considering the for-each recovery guarantee with asymptotically vanishing error probability, we introduce a fast splitting algorithm and establish its near-optimality not only in terms of the number of tests, but also in terms of the decoding time. While the most basic formulations of our algorithms require $\\Omega(n)$ storage for each algorithm, we also provide low-storage variants based on hashing, with similar recovery guarantees.",

Hackathons have been recognized not only as public events for hacking, but also as a corporate mechanism for innovation. Hackathons are a way for established companies to achieve increased employee wellbeing as well as being a curator for innovation and developing new products. Sudden transition to the work-from-home mode caused by the COVID-19 pandemic first put many corporate events requiring collocation, such as hackathons, temporarily on hold and then motivated companies to find ways to hold these events virtually. In this paper, we report our findings from investigating hackathons in the context of a large agile company by first exploring the general benefits and challenges of hackathons and then trying to understand how they were affected by the virtual setup. We conducted nine interviews, surveyed 23 employees and analyzed a hackathon demo. We found that hackathons provide both individual and organizational benefits of innovation, personal interests, and acquiring new skills and competences. Several challenges such as added stress due to stopping the regular work, employees fearing not having enough contribution to deliver and potential mismatch between individual and organizational goals were also found. With respect to the virtual setup, we found that virtual hackathons are not diminishing the innovation benefits, however, some negative effect surfaced on the social and networking side.",

Most efforts focus on first imputing as well as possible and second learning on the completed data to predict the outcome. Yet, this widespread practice has no theoretical grounding. Here we show that for almost all imputation functions, an impute-then-regress procedure with a powerful learner is Bayes optimal. This result holds for all missing-values mechanisms, in contrast with the classic statistical results that require missing-at-random settings to use imputation in probabilistic modeling. Moreover, it implies that perfect conditional imputation may not be needed for good prediction asymptotically. In fact, we show that on perfectly imputed data the best regression function will generally be discontinuous, which makes it hard to learn. Crafting instead the imputation so as to leave the regression function unchanged simply shifts the problem to learning discontinuous imputations. Rather, we suggest that it is easier to learn imputation and regression jointly. We propose such a procedure, adapting NeuMiss, a neural network capturing the conditional links across observed and unobserved variables whatever the missing-value pattern. Experiments confirm that joint imputation and regression through NeuMiss is better than various two step procedures in our experiments with finite number of samples.",

        "abstract": "CTR prediction, which aims to estimate the probability that a user will click an item, plays a crucial role in online advertising and recommender system. Feature interaction modeling based and user interest mining based methods are the two kinds of most popular techniques that have been extensively explored for many years and have made great progress for CTR prediction. However, (1) feature interaction based methods which rely heavily on the co-occurrence of different features, may suffer from the feature sparsity problem (i.e., many features appear few times); (2) user interest mining based methods which need rich user behaviors to obtain user's diverse interests, are easy to encounter the behavior sparsity problem (i.e., many users have very short behavior sequences). To solve these problems, we propose a novel module named Dual Graph enhanced Embedding, which is compatible with various CTR prediction models to alleviate these two problems. We further propose a Dual Graph enhanced Embedding Neural Network (DG-ENN) for CTR prediction. Dual Graph enhanced Embedding exploits the strengths of graph representation with two carefully designed learning strategies (divide-and-conquer, curriculum-learning-inspired organized learning) to refine the embedding. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world industrial datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed DG-ENN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CTR prediction models. Moreover, when applying to state-of-the-art CTR prediction models, Dual graph enhanced embedding always obtains better performance. Further case studies prove that our proposed dual graph enhanced embedding could alleviate the feature sparsity and behavior sparsity problems. Our framework will be open-source based on MindSpore in the near future.",

We are substituting the numerical code by a computationally cheaper projection based surrogate model that is able to approximate the electric fields at a given time without computing all preceding electric fields as required by numerical methods. This means that the projection based surrogate model allows to recover the solution of the governing 3D partial differential equation, 3D wave equation, at any point of a given compute domain and configuration without the need to run a full simulation. This model has shown a good quality of reconstruction in a problem of interpolation of data within a narrow range of simulation parameters and can be used for input data of large size.",

We relax the assumption that the principal perfectly knows the agent by considering a Bayesian setting where the agent's type is unknown and randomly selected according to a given probability distribution, which is known to the principal. Each agent's type is characterized by her own action costs and action-outcome distributions. In the literature on non-Bayesian principal-agent problems, considerable attention has been devoted to linear contracts, which are simple, pure-commission payment schemes that still provide nice approximation guarantees with respect to principal-optimal (possibly non-linear) contracts. While in non-Bayesian settings an optimal contract can be computed efficiently, this is no longer the case for our Bayesian principal-agent problems. This further motivates our focus on linear contracts, which can be optimized efficiently given their single-parameter nature. Our goal is to analyze the properties of linear contracts in Bayesian settings, in terms of approximation guarantees with respect to optimal contracts and general tractable contracts (i.e., efficiently-computable ones). First, we study the approximation guarantees of linear contracts with respect to optimal ones, showing that the former suffer from a multiplicative loss linear in the number of agent's types. Nevertheless, we prove that linear contracts can still provide a constant multiplicative approximation $\\rho$ of the optimal principal's expected utility, though at the expense of an exponentially-small additive loss $2^{-\\Omega(\\rho)}$. Then, we switch to tractable contracts, showing that, surprisingly, linear contracts perform well among them.",

When these moment conditions are specified using Kullback-Leibler or Wasserstein-type divergences, we can find the robust estimators efficiently using convex optimization. We use the Bernstein online aggregation algorithm on the proposed family of robust experts to generate predictions for the sequential stream of target test samples. Numerical experiments on real data show that the robust strategies may outperform non-robust interpolations of the empirical least squares estimators.",

        "abstract": "The next-generation non-volatile memory (NVM) is striding into computer systems as a new tier as it incorporates both DRAM's byte-addressability and disk's persistency. Researchers and practitioners have considered building persistent memory by placing NVM on the memory bus for CPU to directly load and store data. As a result, cache-friendly data structures have been developed for NVM. One of them is the prevalent B+-tree. State-of-the-art in-NVM B+-trees mainly focus on the optimization of write operations (insertion and deletion). However, search is of vital importance for B+-tree. Not only search-intensive workloads benefit from an optimized search, but insertion and deletion also rely on a preceding search operation to proceed. In this paper, we attentively study a sorted B+-tree node that spans over contiguous cache lines. Such cache lines exhibit a monotonically increasing trend and searching a target key across them can be accelerated by estimating a range the key falls into. To do so, we construct a probing Sentinel Array in which a sentinel stands for each cache line of B+-tree node. Checking the Sentinel Array avoids scanning unnecessary cache lines and hence significantly reduces cache misses for a search. A quantitative evaluation shows that using Sentinel Arrays boosts the search performance of state-of-the-art in-NVM B+-trees by up to 48.4% while the cost of maintaining of Sentinel Array is low.",

Chiral routing arises from the electromagnetic field chirality in waveguide, and beamsplitting is obtained via the evanescent field coupling. The spin- and position-dependent directional spontaneous emission are achieved by spatially selective micro-photoluminescence measurements, with a chiral contrast of up to 0.84 in the chiral photonic circuits.

This becomes even more striking when considering that ethical AI development has the aim to be human-centric and of benefit for the whole society. In this study, we investigate how ethical principles (explainability, fairness, security, accountability, accuracy, privacy, machine autonomy) are weighted in comparison to each other. This is especially important, since simultaneously considering ethical principles is not only costly, but sometimes even impossible, as developers must make specific trade-off decisions. In this paper, we give first answers on the relative importance of ethical principles given a specific use case - the use of AI in tax fraud detection. The results of a large conjoint survey (n=1099) suggest that, by and large, German respondents found the ethical principles equally important. However, subsequent cluster analysis shows that different preference models for ethically designed systems exist among the German population. These clusters substantially differ not only in the preferred attributes, but also in the importance level of the attributes themselves. We further describe how these groups are constituted in terms of sociodemographics as well as opinions on AI. Societal implications as well as design challenges are discussed.",

Reasoning on TKGs that predicts potential facts (events) in the future brings great challenges to existing models. When facing a prediction task, human beings usually search useful historical information (i.e., clues) in their memories and then reason for future meticulously. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose CluSTeR to predict future facts in a two-stage manner, Clue Searching and Temporal Reasoning, accordingly. Specifically, at the clue searching stage, CluSTeR learns a beam search policy via reinforcement learning (RL) to induce multiple clues from historical facts. At the temporal reasoning stage, it adopts a graph convolution network based sequence method to deduce answers from clues. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the substantial advantages of CluSTeR compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the clues found by CluSTeR further provide interpretability for the results.",

However, the development of information terminals has made it easier to obtain personal mobility information. In this study, we propose methods for evaluating the mobility of people in a city using global positioning system data. There are two main methods for evaluating movement. One is to create a temporal network from real data and check the change in travel time according to time zones or seasons. Temporal networks are difficult to evaluate because of their time complexity, and in this study, we proposed an evaluation method using the probability density function of travel time. The other method is to define a time-dependent traveling salesman problem and find an efficient traveling route by finding the shortest path. By creating a time-dependent traveling salesman problem in an existing city and solving it, a traveler can choose an efficient route by considering traffic conditions at different times of the day. We used 2 months of data from Kyoto City to conduct a traffic evaluation as a case study.",

        "abstract": "Rigid registration of partial observations is a fundamental problem in various applied fields. In computer graphics, special attention has been given to the registration between two partial point clouds generated by scanning devices. State-of-the-art registration techniques still struggle when the overlap region between the two point clouds is small, and completely fail if there is no overlap between the scan pairs. In this paper, we present a learning-based technique that alleviates this problem, and allows registration between point clouds, presented in arbitrary poses, and having little or even no overlap, a setting that has been referred to as tele-registration. Our technique is based on a novel neural network design that learns a prior of a class of shapes and can complete a partial shape. The key idea is combining the registration and completion tasks in a way that reinforces each other. In particular, we simultaneously train the registration network and completion network using two coupled flows, one that register-and-complete, and one that complete-and-register, and encourage the two flows to produce a consistent result. We show that, compared with each separate flow, this two-flow training leads to robust and reliable tele-registration, and hence to a better point cloud prediction that completes the registered scans. It is also worth mentioning that each of the components in our neural network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both completion and registration. We further analyze our network with several ablation studies and demonstrate its performance on a large number of partial point clouds, both synthetic and real-world, that have only small or no overlap.",

Resonant excitation of high-energy transitions of the ions is achieved through Doppler-boosting (by twice the Larmor factor; from hundred to several thousand times) of light energy. In order to efficiently excite the ions, and hence generate intense beams of scattered/fluorescent photons, a detailed knowledge of the ions' energy structure and dynamics of optical pumping is required. Spectroscopic properties of PSI selected for the GF operation, as well as their optical pumping schemes are investigated. Two regimes of the light-ion interaction are identified, leading to different dynamics of the pumping process. The efficiency of the light-ion interaction as well as the number of photons emitted from a single ion bunch is estimated, both analytically and numerically, for three ions considered for the GF, i.e.~Li-like ${}^{208}_{\\phantom{0}82}$Pb$^{79+}$, Li-like ${}^{40}_{20}$Ca$^{17+}$, and H-like ${}^{208}_{\\phantom{0}82}$Pb$^{81+}$.",

Our results are concerning the case when $K$ is in some quantitative sense small, namely when certain finite dimensional subspaces $E_n$ of $X$ are sufficiently close to the points of $K\\setminus E_n$. Under such assumptions we obtain a near characterization of the $\\pi$-property (resp. Finite Dimensional Decomposition property) of a separable Banach space $X$. In one direction, if $X$ admits the Finite Dimensional Decomposition (which is isomorphically equivalent to the metric-$\\pi$-property) then we construct a Lipschitz retraction onto a (small) generating convex compact $K$. On the other hand, we prove that if $X$ admits a small (in a precise sense) generating compact Lipschitz retract then $X$ has the $\\pi$-property. It seems to be an open problem whether the $\\pi$-property is isomorphically equivalent to the metric-$\\pi$-property (a positive answer would turn our results into a complete characterization). We also give an example of a small generating convex compact which is not a Lipschitz retract of $C[0,1]$, although it is contained in a small convex Lipschitz retract and contains another one. In the final part of our note we prove that a convex and compact set $K$ in any Banach space with a Uniformly Rotund in Every Direction norm is a uniform retract, of every bounded set containing it, via the nearest point map.",

Central to this objective-UQ is the concept of mean objective cost of uncertainty (MOCU), which provides effective means of quantifying the impact of uncertainty on the operational goals at hand. MOCU is especially useful for optimal experimental design (OED), as the potential efficacy of an experimental campaign can be quantified by estimating the MOCU after the campaign. However, MOCU-based OED tends to be computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning (ML) scheme that can significantly accelerate MOCU computation and MOCU-based experimental design. The main idea is to use an ML model to efficiently search for the optimal robust operator under model uncertainty, a necessary step for computing MOCU. We apply the proposed scheme to design experiments aimed at optimally enhancing the control performance of uncertain Kuramoto oscillator models. Our results show that the proposed scheme results in up to 154-fold speed improvement without any degradation of the OED performance.",

        "abstract": "High-resolution Fourier-transform spectroscopy using table-top sources in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range is still in its infancy. In this contribution a significant advance is presented based on a Michelson-type all-reflective split-and-delay autocorrelator operating in a quasi amplitude splitting mode. The autocorrelator works under a grazing incidence angle in a broad spectral range $\\mathrm{(10\\,nm - 1\\,\\mu m)}$ providing collinear propagation of both pulse replicas and thus a constant phase difference across the beam profile. The compact instrument allows for XUV pulse autocorrelation measurements in the time domain with a single-digit attosecond precision resulting in a resolution of $\\mathrm{E/\\Delta E=2000}$. Its performance for spectroscopic applications is demonstrated by characterizing a very sharp electronic transition at $\\mathrm{26.6\\,eV}$ in Ar gas induced by the $\\mathrm{11^{th}}$ harmonic of a frequency-doubled Yb-fiber laser leading to the characteristic $\\mathrm{3s3p^{6}4p^{1}P^{1}}$ Fano-resonance of Ar atoms. We benchmark our time-domain interferometry results with a high-resolution XUV grating spectrometer and find an excellent agreement.

Several previous works on syntactic parsing propose to annotate shallow word-internal structures for better utilizing character-level information. This work proposes to model the deep internal structures of Chinese words as dependency trees with 11 labels for distinguishing syntactic relationships. First, based on newly compiled annotation guidelines, we manually annotate a word-internal structure treebank (WIST) consisting of over 30K multi-char words from Chinese Penn Treebank. To guarantee quality, each word is independently annotated by two annotators and inconsistencies are handled by a third senior annotator. Second, we present detailed and interesting analysis on WIST to reveal insights on Chinese word formation. Third, we propose word-internal structure parsing as a new task, and conduct benchmark experiments using a competitive dependency parser. Finally, we present two simple ways to encode word-internal structures, leading to promising gains on the sentence-level syntactic parsing task.",

We manually studied over 4K duplicate logging statements and their surrounding code in five large-scale open source systems. We uncovered five patterns of duplicate logging code smells. For each instance of the duplicate logging code smell, we further manually identify the potentially problematic and justifiable cases. Then, we contact developers to verify our manual study result. We integrated our manual study result and the feedback of developers into our automated static analysis tool, DLFinder, which automatically detects problematic duplicate logging code smells. We evaluated DLFinder on the five manually studied systems and three additional systems. In total, combining the results of DLFinder and our manual analysis, we reported 91 problematic duplicate logging code smell instances to developers and all of them have been fixed. We further study the relationship between duplicate logging statements, including the problematic instances of duplicate logging code smells, and code clones. We find that 83% of the duplicate logging code smell instances reside in cloned code, but 17% of them reside in micro-clones that are difficult to detect using automated clone detection tools. We also find that more than half of the duplicate logging statements reside in cloned code snippets, and a large portion of them reside in very short code blocks which may not be effectively detected by existing code clone detection tools. Our study shows that, in addition to general source code that implements the business logic, code clones may also result in bad logging practices that could increase maintenance difficulties.",

In this work, we use the flip-chip technology to realize a modified transmon qubit, donated as the \"flipmon\", whose large shunt capacitor is replaced by a vacuum-gap parallel plate capacitor. To further reduce the qubit footprint, we place one of the qubit pads and a single Josephson junction on the bottom chip and the other pad on the top chip which is galvanically connected with the single Josephson junction through an indium bump. The electric field participation ratio can arrive at nearly 53% in air when the vacuum-gap is about 5 microns, and thus potentially leading to a lower dielectric loss. The coherence times of the flipmons are measured in the range of 30-60 microseconds, which are comparable with that of traditional transmons with similar fabrication processes. The electric field simulation indicates that the metal-air interface's participation ratio increases significantly and may dominate the qubit's decoherence. This suggests that more careful surface treatment needs to be considered. No evidence shows that the indium bumps inside the flipmons cause significant decoherence. With well-designed geometry and good surface treatment, the coherence of the flipmons can be further improved.",

Finding couples $\\left( A,\\lambda\\right) $ for which we obtain a probability generating function is a difficult problem. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the coefficients $a_{T}$ of $A$ for which we obtain a probability generating function for any positive number $\\lambda$ are know by (Bernardoff, 2003). Thus we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on $\\mathbf{a}=\\left( a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\right) $ so that $\\mathbf{a}=\\left( \\mathbf{e}^{t_{1}},\\ldots,\\mathbf{e}^{t_{n}}\\right) $ with $\\mathbf{t}=\\left( t_{1},\\ldots,t_{n}\\right) $ belonging to $\\Omega$.

Of particular importance is the development of model-free techniques that work without knowledge about the underlying channel. Such techniques utilize for example generative adversarial networks to estimate and model the conditional channel distribution, mutual information estimation as a reward function, or reinforcement learning. In this paper, the approach of reinforcement learning is studied and, in particular, the policy gradient method for a model-free approach of neural network-based secure encoding is investigated. Previously developed techniques for enforcing a certain co-set structure on the encoding process can be combined with recent reinforcement learning approaches. This new approach is evaluated by extensive simulations, and it is demonstrated that the resulting decoding performance of an eavesdropper is capped at a certain error level.",

Providing strong consistency in such data stores results in high latencies and makes the system vulnerable to network partitions. The alternative of relaxing consistency violates crucial correctness properties. A compromise is to allow multiple consistency levels to coexist in the data store. In this paper we present UniStore, the first fault-tolerant and scalable data store that combines causal and strong consistency. The key challenge we address in UniStore is to maintain liveness despite data center failures: this could be compromised if a strong transaction takes a dependency on a causal transaction that is later lost because of a failure. UniStore ensures that such situations do not arise while paying the cost of durability for causal transactions only when necessary. We evaluate UniStore on Amazon EC2 using both microbenchmarks and a sample application. Our results show that UniStore effectively and scalably combines causal and strong consistency.",

We focus on the so-called vortex states, in which the muon carries a non-zero orbital angular momentum with respect to the average propagation direction and exhibits a cone structure in the momentum distribution. We compute the spectrum and the angular distribution of electrons emitted in decays of vortex muons and show that the most revealing observable is not the angular distribution but the fixed-angle electron spectra. Even for very small cone opening angles of the vortex muons, it will be easy to observe significant modifications of the electron spectra which would allows one to distinguish plane wave and vortex muons, as well as differentiate various polarization states. These features will be the key to tracking the evolution of vortex muons in external magnetic fields.",

This confirms that the extension of the crust may be larger than expected. It is also verified that the equilibrium structure of the clusterized matter is very sensitive to the intensity of the magnetic fields. As a result, the decay of the magnetic field may give rise to internal stresses which may result on the yield and fracture of the inner crust lattice.",

As a testing ground, we use data from a new historical database that includes annual panel data on approximately 2,400 Swedish geographical units, i.e., local governments, during the period 1860-1917. We use a staggered event study design that is robust to treatment effect heterogeneity. Importantly, we find extremely large reduced-form effects of having access to railways. For real nonagricultural income, the cumulative treatment effect is approximately 120% after 30 years. Therefore, this effect is 20 times larger than most reduced-form effects found in previous works on the effect of transport infrastructure on economic activity. Equally important, we also show that our reduced-form effect reflects growth rather than a reorganization of existing economic activity.",

In contrast to other approaches to bulk reconstruction, bilocal holography does not take input from the dual gravitational theory. The resulting map is a complete bulk/boundary mapping in that it maps the complete set of $O(N)$ invariant degrees of freedom in the CFT, to the complete set of higher spin degrees of freedom. After restricting to a suitable code subspace we demonstrate that bilocal holography naturally reproduces the quantum error correcting properties of holography and it gives a robust bulk (entanglement wedge) reconstruction. A gauge invariant entangled pair of CFT degrees of freedom are naturally smeared over a semicircle in the bulk spacetime, which is highly suggestive of bit threads. Finally, we argue that finite $N$ relations in the CFT, when interpreted in the dual AdS spacetime, can provide relations between degrees of freedom located near the boundary and degrees of freedom deep in the bulk.",

We use data from a historical nondemocratic society with a weighted voting system where eligible voters received votes in proportion to their taxable income and without any limit on the maximum of votes, i.e., the political system used in Swedish local governments during the period 1862-1909. We use a novel identification strategy where we combine two different identification strategies, i.e., a threshold regression analysis and a generalized event-study design, both of which exploit nonlinearities or discontinuities in the effect of political power between two opposing local elites: agricultural landowners and emerging industrialists. The results suggest that school spending is approximately 90-120% higher if the nonagrarian interest controls all of the votes compared to when landowners have more than a majority of votes. Moreover, we find no evidence that the concentration of landownership affected this relationship",

However, control of valley pseudospin of interlayer excitons in pristine bilayer MoS2, which lies at the heart of valleytronics, has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of highly circularly polarized photoluminescence from interlayer excitons of bilayer MoS2 with both optical and magnetic addressability. Under excitation of circularly polarized light near exciton resonance, interlayer excitons of bilayer MoS2 show a near-unity, but negative circular polarization. Significantly, by breaking time-reversal symmetry with an out-of-plane magnetic field, a record level of spontaneous valley polarization (7.7%/Tesla) is identified for interlayer excitons in bilayer MoS2. The giant valley polarization of the interlayer excitons in bilayer MoS2, together with the feasibility of electrical/optical/magnetic control and strong oscillator strength, provides a firm basis for the development of next-generation electronic and optoelectronic applications.",

However, the study had methodological issues and was undertaken using a small sample size leading to unreliable results. We present a replication study in which we also bin sentences by length and find that only a small subset of sentences vary in performance with respect to graph isomorphism. Further, the correlation observed between parser performance and graph isomorphism in the wild disappears when controlling for covariants. However, in a controlled experiment, where covariants are kept fixed, we do observe a strong correlation. We suggest that conclusions drawn from statistical analyses like this need to be tempered and that controlled experiments can complement them by more readily teasing factors apart.",

        "abstract": "We study the antikaon-induced inclusive cascade $\\Xi^-$ hyperon production from $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei near threshold within a nuclear spectral function approach. The approach describes incoherent direct $\\Xi^-$ hyperon production in elementary ${K^-}p \\to {K^+}\\Xi^-$ and ${K^-}n \\to {K^0}\\Xi^-$ processes as well as takes into account the influence of the scalar nuclear $K^-$, $K^+$, $K^0$, $\\Xi^-$ and their Coulomb potentials on these processes. We calculate the absolute differential and total cross sections for the production of $\\Xi^-$ hyperons off these nuclei at laboratory angles $\\le$ 45$^{\\circ}$ by $K^-$ mesons with momenta of 1.0 and 1.3 GeV/c, which are close to the threshold momentum (1.05 GeV/c) for $\\Xi^-$ hyperon production on the free target nucleon at rest. We also calculate the momentum dependence of the transparency ratio for the $^{184}$W/$^{12}$C combination for $\\Xi^-$ hyperons at these $K^-$ beam momenta. We show that the $\\Xi^-$ differential and total (absolute and relative) production cross sections at the considered initial momenta reveal a distinct sensitivity to the variations in the scalar $\\Xi^-$ nuclear potential at saturation density $\\rho_0$, studied in the paper, in the low-momentum region of 0.1--0.6 GeV/c. We also demonstrate that for the subthreshold $K^-$ meson momentum of 1.0 GeV/c there is a strong sensitivity of the transparency ratio for $\\Xi^-$ hyperons to the considered changes in the $\\Xi^-$ nuclear potential at all outgoing $\\Xi^-$ momenta as well. Therefore, the measurement of these absolute and relative observables in a dedicated experiment at the J-PARC will provide valuable information on the $\\Xi^-$ in-medium properties, which will be complementary to that deduced from the study of the inclusive ($K^-$,$K^+$) reactions at incident momenta of 1.6--1.8 GeV/c in the $\\Xi^-$ bound and quasi-free regions.",

        "abstract": "To manage the COVID-19 epidemic effectively, decision-makers in public health need accurate forecasts of case numbers. A potential near real-time predictor of future case numbers is human mobility; however, research on the predictive power of mobility is lacking. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel model for epidemic forecasting based on mobility data, called mobility marked Hawkes model. The proposed model consists of three components: (1) A Hawkes process captures the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. (2) A mark modulates the rate of infections, thus accounting for how the reproduction number R varies across space and time. The mark is modeled using a regularized Poisson regression based on mobility covariates. (3) A correction procedure incorporates new cases seeded by people traveling between regions. Our model was evaluated on the COVID-19 epidemic in Switzerland. Specifically, we used mobility data from February through April 2020, amounting to approximately 1.5 billion trips. Trip counts were derived from large-scale telecommunication data, i.e., cell phone pings from the Swisscom network, the largest telecommunication provider in Switzerland. We compared our model against various state-of-the-art baselines in terms of out-of-sample root mean squared error. We found that our model outperformed the baselines by 15.52%. The improvement was consistently achieved across different forecast horizons between 5 and 21 days. In addition, we assessed the predictive power of conventional point of interest data, confirming that telecommunication data is superior. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to predict the spread of COVID-19 from telecommunication data. Altogether, our work contributes to previous research by developing a scalable early warning system for decision-makers in public health tasked with controlling the spread of infectious diseases.",

However, the objective of the PCP has a min-max structure which could lead to many symmetric optimal, i.e., ground-truth solutions and other potential difficulties for learning. Our obtained preliminary results show that indeed a direct transfer of network architecture ideas does not seem to work too well.

        "abstract": "Cross-modal retrieval is an important functionality in modern search engines, as it increases the user experience by allowing queries and retrieved objects to pertain to different modalities. In this paper, we focus on the image-sentence retrieval task, where the objective is to efficiently find relevant images for a given sentence (image-retrieval) or the relevant sentences for a given image (sentence-retrieval). Computer vision literature reports the best results on the image-sentence matching task using deep neural networks equipped with attention and self-attention mechanisms. They evaluate the matching performance on the retrieval task by performing sequential scans of the whole dataset. This method does not scale well with an increasing amount of images or captions. In this work, we explore different preprocessing techniques to produce sparsified deep multi-modal features extracting them from state-of-the-art deep-learning architectures for image-text matching. Our main objective is to lay down the paths for efficient indexing of complex multi-modal descriptions. We use the recently introduced TERN architecture as an image-sentence features extractor. It is designed for producing fixed-size 1024-d vectors describing whole images and sentences, as well as variable-length sets of 1024-d vectors describing the various building components of the two modalities (image regions and sentence words respectively). All these vectors are enforced by the TERN design to lie into the same common space. Our experiments show interesting preliminary results on the explored methods and suggest further experimentation in this important research direction.",

However, existing orientation estimation methods, which are based on computer-vision techniques, still have a lot of room for improvement. To the best of our knowledge, this article presents the first deep learning model for estimating orientation directly from video footage. By approaching this challenge as a classification problem where classes correspond to orientation bins, and by introducing a cyclic loss function, a well-known convolutional network is refined to provide player orientation data. The model is trained by using ground-truth orientation data obtained from wearable EPTS devices, which are individually compensated with respect to the perceived orientation in the current frame. The obtained results outperform previous methods; in particular, the absolute median error is less than 12 degrees per player. An ablation study is included in order to show the potential generalization to any kind of football video footage.",

An unexpected connection between these states and the seemingly unrelated phenomenon of bound states in the continuum (BICs) was recently unveiled. When nonlinearity is added to a HOTI system, a number of fundamentally important questions arise. For example, how does nonlinearity couple higher-order topological BICs with the rest of the system, including continuum states? In fact, thus far BICs in nonlinear HOTIs have remained unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the interplay of nonlinearity, higher-order topology, and BICs in a photonic platform. We observe topological corner states which, serendipitously, are also BICs in a laser-written second-order topological lattice. We further demonstrate nonlinear coupling with edge states at a low nonlinearity, transitioning to solitons at a high nonlinearity. Theoretically, we calculate the analog of the Zak phase in the nonlinear regime, illustrating that a topological BIC can be actively tuned by both focusing and defocusing nonlinearities. Our studies are applicable to other nonlinear HOTI systems, with promising applications in emerging topology-driven devices.",

When a scalar optimization problem is considered it is possible to prove that under some assumptions the set of functions for which the related optimzation problem is well-posed is dense or even more in \"big\" i.e. contains a dense $G_{\\delta}$ set (these results are called genericity results).

We extrapolate these results to the continuum limit of each theory and then to N=oo. For a number of these states we are able to identify their continuum spins with very little ambiguity. We calculate the fundamental string tension and k=2 string tension and investigate the N dependence of the ratio. Using the string tension as the scale, we confirm that g(a)**2 varies as 1/N for constant physics at large N. We fit our calculated values of the string tension with the 3-loop beta-function, and extract a value for Lambda-MSbar, in units of the string tension, for all our values of N, including SU(3). We provide analytic formulae for estimating the string tension at a given lattice coupling. We calculate the topological charge Q for N less than or equal to 6, where it fluctuates sufficiently for a plausible estimate of the continuum topological susceptibility. We also calculate the renormalisation of the lattice topological charge, ZQ(beta), for all our SU(N) gauge theories, using a standard definition of the charge, and we provide interpolating formulae, which may be useful in estimating the renormalisation of the lattice theta parameter. We provide quantitative results for how the topological charge `freezes' with decreasing lattice spacing and with increasing N. Although we are able to show that within our typical errors our glueball and string tension results are insensitive to the freezing of Q at larger N and beta, we choose to perform our calculations with a typical distribution of Q imposed upon the fields so as to further reduce any potential systematic errors.",

Gauge invariance of observables with external (partially)-massless spinning fields translates into Ward-Takahashi identities on the boundary. Using the Mellin-Barnes representation for boundary correlators in momentum space, we give a systematic study of Ward-Takahashi identities for tree-level 3- and 4-point processes involving a single external (partially-)massless field of arbitrary integer spin-$J$. 3-point Ward-Takahashi identities constrain the mass of the scalar fields to which a (partially-)massless spin-$J$ field can couple. 4-point Ward-Takahashi identities then constrain the corresponding cubic couplings. For massless spinning fields, we show that Weinberg's flat space results carry over to $\\left(d+1\\right)$-dimensional de Sitter space: For spins $J=1,2$ gauge-invariance implies charge-conservation and the equivalence principle while, assuming locality, higher-spins $J>2$ cannot couple consistently to scalar matter. This result also applies to anti-de Sitter space. For partially-massless fields, restricting for simplicity to those of depth-2, we show that there is no consistent coupling to scalar matter in local theories. Along the way we give a detailed account of how contact amplitudes with and without derivatives are represented in the Mellin-Barnes representation. Various new explicit expressions for 3- and 4-point functions involving (partially-)massless fields and conformally coupled scalars in dS$_4$ are given.",

Motivated by ever increasing popularity of cache-enabled content delivery in wireless communications, this paper proposes an innovative multigroup multicast transmission scheme based on RSMA for cache-aided cloud-radio access networks (C-RAN). Our proposed scheme not only exploits the properties of content-centric communications and local caching at the base stations (BSs), but also incorporates RSMA to better manage interference in multigroup multicast transmission with statistical channel state information (CSI) known at the central processor (CP) and the BSs. At the RSMA-enabled cloud CP, the message of each multicast group is split into a private and a common part with the former private part being decoded by all users in the respective group and the latter common part being decoded by multiple users from other multicast groups. Common message decoding is done for the purpose of mitigating the interference. In this work, we jointly optimize the clustering of BSs and the precoding with the aim of maximizing the minimum rate among all multicast groups to guarantee fairness serving all groups. The problem is a mixed-integer non-linear stochastic program (MINLSP), which is solved by a practical algorithm we proposed including a heuristic clustering algorithm for assigning a set of BSs to serve each user followed by an efficient iterative algorithm that combines the sample average approximation (SAA) and weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) to solve the stochastic non-convex sub-problem of precoder design. Numerical results show the explicit max-min rate gain of our proposed transmission scheme compared to the state-of-the-art trivial interference processing methods. Therefore, we conclude that RSMA is a promising technique for cache-aided C-RAN.",

The method provides the probability of absorbing photons from a driving laser field towards the generation of a strong laser-field interaction product, such as high-order harmonics. In this case, the harmonic spectrum is reflected in the photon number distribution of the infrared (IR) driving field after its interaction with the high harmonic generation medium. The method was implemented in non-relativistic interactions using high harmonics produced by the interaction of strong laser pulses with atoms and semiconductors. Very recently, it was used for the generation of non-classical light states in intense laser-atom interaction, building the basis for studies of quantum electrodynamics in strong laser-field physics and the development of a new class of non-classical light sources for applications in quantum technology. Here, after a brief introduction of the QS method, we will discuss how the QS can be applied in relativistic laser-plasma interactions and become the driving factor for initiating investigations on relativistic quantum electrodynamics.",

This method can be applied on the brachial plexus (BP) after clavicular surgeries. However, identification of the BP from ultrasound (US) images is difficult, even for trained professionals. To address this problem, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and more advanced deep neural networks (DNNs) can be used for identification and segmentation of the BP nerve region. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model consisting of a classification model followed by a segmentation model to segment BP nerve regions in ultrasound images. A CNN model is employed as a classifier to precisely select the images with the BP region. Then, a U-net or M-net model is used for the segmentation. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed hybrid model significantly improves the segmentation performance over a single segmentation model.",

Well-mixed room models significantly underestimate the risk of infection for short and direct exposure. To this end, we estimate the upper bound for infection risk with the susceptible in the infectious exhalation cloud or wearing masks by having the masked susceptible inhale the entire exhalation of a masked infectious. Social distances without a mask, even at 3m between speaking individuals results in an upper bound of 90\\% for risk of infection after a few minutes. If both wear a surgical mask, the risk of infection for the person speaking remains below 26\\% even after 60 minutes. When both the infectious and susceptible wear a well-fitting FFP2 mask, the upper bound for risk is reduced by a factor of 60 compared to surgical masks. In both cases, face leakage is very important. For FFP2 masks, leakage is low in the nasal region and directed upward, which can be further reduced significantly by applying double-sided medical tape there. Considering that the calculated upper bound greatly overestimates the risk of infection, and the fact that with a poorly worn mask even the upper bound we calculated is very low, we conclude that wearing a mask, even with some leakage, provides excellent third party and self-protection.",

As there is a lack of 3D point clouds datasets related to the fine-grained building facade, we construct the first large-scale building facade point clouds benchmark dataset for semantic segmentation. The existing methods of semantic segmentation cannot fully mine the local neighborhood information of point clouds. Addressing this problem, we propose a learnable attention module that learns Dual Local Attention features, called DLA in this paper. The proposed DLA module consists of two blocks, including the self-attention block and attentive pooling block, which both embed an enhanced position encoding block. The DLA module could be easily embedded into various network architectures for point cloud segmentation, naturally resulting in a new 3D semantic segmentation network with an encoder-decoder architecture, called DLA-Net in this work. Extensive experimental results on our constructed building facade dataset demonstrate that the proposed DLA-Net achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation.",

The original mathematical programming formulation of the CFSTP is difficult to implement, since it is lengthy and based on the problematic Big-M method. In this paper, we propose a compact and easy-to-implement formulation. Moreover, we design D-CTS, a distributed version of the state-of-the-art CFSTP algorithm. Using public London Fire Brigade records, we create a dataset with $347588$ tasks and a test framework that simulates the mobilization of firefighters in dynamic environments. In problems with up to $150$ agents and $3000$ tasks, compared to DSA-SDP, a state-of-the-art distributed algorithm, D-CTS completes $3.79\\% \\pm [42.22\\%, 1.96\\%]$ more tasks, and is one order of magnitude more efficient in terms of communication overhead and time complexity. D-CTS sets the first large-scale, dynamic and distributed CFSTP benchmark.",

For this goal, we consider a system of either two distinguishable or indistinguishable (bosons and fermions) particles. Two classes of initial conditions have been studied: different initial locations with the same momenta, and the same locations with different momenta. The flight time distribution of particles arriving at a `screen' is calculated in each case. Fermions display broader distributions as compared with either distinguishable particles or bosons, leading to earlier and later arrivals for all the cases analyzed here. The symmetry of the wave function seems to speed up or slow down propagation of particles. Due to the cross terms, certain initial conditions lead to bimodality in the fermionic case. Within the nonrelativistic domain and when the short-time survival probability is analyzed, if the cross term becomes important, one finds that the decay of the overlap of fermions is faster than for distinguishable particles which in turn is faster than for bosons. These results are of interest in the short time limit since they imply that the well-known quantum Zeno effect would be stronger for bosons than for fermions.Fermions also arrive earlier than bosons when they are scattered by a delta barrier. Furthermore, the particle symmetry does not affect the mean tunneling flight time and it is given by the phase time for the distinguishable particle.",

        "abstract": "Many of the models used nowadays in mathematical epidemiology, in particular in COVID-19 research, belong to a certain sub-class of compartmental models whose classes may be divided into three \"(x, y, z)\" groups, which we will call respectively \"susceptible/entrance, diseased, and output\" (in the classic SIR case, there is only one class of each type). Roughly, the ODE dynamics of these models contain only linear terms, with the exception of products between x and y terms. It has long been noticed that the basic reproduction number R has a very simple formula (3.3) in terms of the matrices which define the model, and an explicit first integral formula (3.8) is also available. These results can be traced back at least to [ABvdD+07] and [Fen07], respectively, and may be viewed as the \"basic laws of SIR-type epidemics\"; however many papers continue to reprove them in particular instances (by the next-generation matrix method or by direct computations, which are unnecessary). This motivated us to redraw the attention to these basic laws and provide a self-contained reference of related formulas for (x, y, z) models. We propose to rebaptize the class to which they apply as matrix SIR epidemic models, abbreviated as SYR, to emphasize the similarity to the classic SIR case. For the case of one susceptible class, we propose to use the name SIR-PH, due to a simple probabilistic interpretation as SIR models where the exponential infection time has been replaced by a PH-type distribution. We note that to each SIR-PH model, one may associate a scalar quantity Y(t) which satisfies \"classic SIR relations\", see (3.8). In the case of several susceptible classes, this generalizes to (5.10); in a future paper, we will show that (3.8), (5.10) may be used to obtain approximate control policies which compare well with the optimal control of the original model.",

Using the Green Bank Telescope, we have detected radio pulsations from PSR J1813-1749 at 4.4-10.2 GHz. The pulse is highly scattered, with an exponential decay timescale \\tau longer than that of any other pulsar at these frequencies. A point source detected at this position by Dzib et al. in several observations with the Jansky Very Large Array can be attributed to the pulsed emission. The steep dependence of \\tau on observing frequency explains why all previous pulsation searches at lower frequencies failed (\\tau~0.25 s at 2 GHz). The large dispersion measure, DM=1087 pc/cc, indicates a distance of either 6.2 or 12 kpc according to two widely used models of the electron density distribution in the Galaxy. These disfavor a previously suggested association with a young stellar cluster at the closer distance of 4.8 kpc. The high X-ray measured column density of ~1e23/cm^2 also supports a large distance. If at d~12 kpc, HESS J1813-178 would be one of the most luminous TeV sources in the Galaxy.",

Currently this is done manually, a time-consuming and subjective process. This paper presents an automated process utilising the advantages of machine learning to increase capacity and standardisation of cell abnormality detection, and its performance is analysed. Three different machine learning technologies were used: a Support Vector Machine (SVM), a classical machine learning technology; TabNet, a deep learning architecture for tabular data; U-Net, a semantic segmentation network designed for medical image segmentation. A critical issue was the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset which impacts the efficacy of machine learning. To address this, synthesising minority class samples in feature space was investigated via Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and cost-sensitive learning. A combination of these two methods is investigated to improve the overall performance. These strategies were found to increase sensitivity to minority classes. The impact of unknown cells on semantic segmentation is demonstrated, with some evidence of the model applying learning of labelled cells to these anonymous cells. These findings indicate both classical models and new deep learning networks as promising methods in automating RBC abnormality detection.",

The extension of fuzzy logic with a typicality operator was proposed in recent work to define a fuzzy multipreference semantics for Multilayer Perceptrons, by regarding the deep neural network as a conditional knowledge base. In this paper, we study its properties. First, a monotonic extension of a fuzzy ALC with typicality is considered (called ALCFT) and a reformulation the KLM properties of a preferential consequence relation for this logic is devised. Most of the properties are satisfied, depending on the reformulation and on the fuzzy combination functions considered. We then strengthen ALCFT with a closure construction by introducing a notion of faithful model of a weighted knowledge base, which generalizes the notion of coherent model of a conditional knowledge base previously introduced, and we study its properties.",

        "abstract": "We examine the problem of time delay estimation, or temporal calibration, in the context of multisensor data fusion. Differences in processing intervals and other factors typically lead to a relative delay between measurement from two disparate sensors. Correct (optimal) data fusion demands that the relative delay must either be known in advance or identified online. There have been several recent proposals in the literature to determine the delay parameter using recursive, causal filters such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF). We carefully review this formulation and show that there are fundamental issues with the structure of the EKF (and related algorithms) when the delay is included in the filter state vector as a value to be estimated. These structural issues, in turn, leave recursive filters prone to bias and inconsistency. Our theoretical analysis is supported by simulation studies that demonstrate the implications in terms of filter performance; although tuning of the filter noise variances may reduce the chance of inconsistency or divergence, the underlying structural concerns remain. We offer brief suggestions for ways to maintain the computational efficiency of recursive filtering for temporal calibration while avoiding the drawbacks of the standard algorithms.",

It is commonly assumed that the merger rate of the astrophysical compact objects is closely connected with the star formation rate, which peaks around redshift $z\\sim 2$. However, a major source of uncertainty is the delay time between the formation and merger of compact objects. We explore the impact of delay time on the lensing event rate. We show that as the delay time increases, the peak of the merger rate of gravitational wave sources gets deferred to a lower redshift. This leads to a reduction in the event rate of the lensed events which are detectable by the gravitational wave detectors. We show that for a delay time of around $10$ Gyr or larger, the lensed event rate can be less than one per year for the design sensitivity of LIGO/Virgo. We also estimate the merger rate for lensed sub-threshold for different delay time scenarios, finding that for larger delay times the number of lensed sub-threshold events is reduced, whereas for small-delay time models they are significantly more frequent. This analysis shows for the first time that lensing is a complementary probe to explore different formation channels of binary systems by exploiting the lensing event rate from the well-detected events and sub-threshold events which are measurable using the network of gravitational wave detectors.",

This paper presents Relational Reasoning Networks (R2N), a novel end-to-end model that performs relational reasoning in the latent space of a deep learner architecture, where the representations of constants, ground atoms and their manipulations are learned in an integrated fashion. Unlike flat architectures like Knowledge Graph Embedders, which can only represent relations between entities, R2Ns define an additional computational structure, accounting for higher-level relations among the ground atoms. The considered relations can be explicitly known, like the ones defined by logic formulas, or defined as unconstrained correlations among groups of ground atoms. R2Ns can be applied to purely symbolic tasks or as a neuro-symbolic platform to integrate learning and reasoning in heterogeneous problems with both symbolic and feature-based represented entities. The proposed model bridges the gap between previous neuro-symbolic methods that have been either limited in terms of scalability or expressivity. The proposed methodology is shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in different experimental settings.",

A typical approach to this task is to estimate the conditional quantiles with quantile regression -- it is well-known that this leads to correct coverage in the large-sample limit, although it may not be accurate in finite samples. We find in experiments that traditional quantile regression can have poor conditional coverage. To remedy this, we modify the loss function to promote independence between the size of the intervals and the indicator of a miscoverage event. For the true conditional quantiles, these two quantities are independent (orthogonal), so the modified loss function continues to be valid. Moreover, we empirically show that the modified loss function leads to improved conditional coverage, as evaluated by several metrics. We also introduce two new metrics that check conditional coverage by looking at the strength of the dependence between the interval size and the indicator of miscoverage.",

The accuracy limits on distance and position estimation are calculated in terms of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for three different scenarios. Scenario~1 and Scenario~2 correspond to synchronous and asynchronous systems, respectively, with known channel attenuation formulas at the receiver. In Scenario~3, a synchronous system is considered but channel attenuation formulas are not known at the receiver. The derived CRLB expressions reveal the relations among distance/position estimation accuracies in the considered scenarios and lead to intuitive explanations for the benefits of using RGB LEDs. In addition, maximum likelihood (ML) estimators are derived in all scenarios, and it is shown that they can achieve close performance to the CRLBs in some cases for sufficiently high source optical powers.",

More precisely, our approach constructs jointly the sequences of exit times and corresponding exit positions of some well-chosen domains, the construction of these domains being an important step. Based on this procedure, we emphasize an algorithm which is easy to implement. Moreover, we can develop the method for any dimension. We treat separately the integer dimension case and the non integer framework, each situation requiring appropriate techniques. In particular, for both situations, we show the convergence of the scheme and provide the control of the efficiency with respect to the small parameter $\\varepsilon$.

Correspondingly, we propose three kinds of tokenizers: 1) SHUOWEN (meaning Talk Word), the pronunciation-based tokenizers; 2) JIEZI (meaning Solve Character), the glyph-based tokenizers; 3) Word segmented tokenizers, the tokenizers with Chinese word segmentation. To empirically compare the effectiveness of studied tokenizers, we pretrain BERT-style language models with them and evaluate the models on various downstream NLU tasks. We find that SHUOWEN and JIEZI tokenizers can generally outperform conventional single-character tokenizers, while Chinese word segmentation shows no benefit as a preprocessing step. Moreover, the proposed SHUOWEN and JIEZI tokenizers exhibit significantly better robustness in handling noisy texts.

        "abstract": "The network coloring game has been proposed in the literature of social sciences as a model for conflict-resolution circumstances. The players of the game are the vertices of a graph with $n$ vertices and maximum degree $\\Delta$. The game is played over rounds, and in each round all players simultaneously choose a color from a set of available colors. Players have local information of the graph: they only observe the colors chosen by their neighbors and do not communicate or cooperate with one another. A player is happy when she has chosen a color that is different from the colors chosen by her neighbors, otherwise she is unhappy, and a configuration of colors for which all players are happy is a proper coloring of the graph. It has been shown in the literature that, when the players adopt a particular greedy randomized strategy, the game reaches a proper coloring of the graph within $O(\\log(n))$ rounds, with high probability, provided the number of colors available to each player is at least $\\Delta+2$. In this note we show that a modification of the aforementioned greedy strategy yields likewise a proper coloring of the graph, provided the number of colors available to each player is at least $\\Delta+1$.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel framework for single-pixel imaging via compressive sensing (CS) in shift-invariant (SI) spaces by exploiting the sparsity property of a wavelet representation. We reinterpret the acquisition procedure of a single-pixel camera as filtering of the observed signal with continuous-domain functions that lie in an SI subspace spanned by the integer shifts of the box function. The signal is modeled by an arbitrary SI generator whose special case is the box function, which, as we show in the paper, is conventionally used in single-pixel imaging. We propose to use separable B-spline generators which are intuitively complemented by sparsity-inducing spline wavelets. The SI models of the acquisition and the underlying signal lead to an exact discretization of an inherently continuous-domain inverse problem to a finite-dimensional problem of CS type. By solving the CS optimization problem, a parametric representation of the signal is obtained. Such a representation offers many practical advantages in image processing applications. We propose an efficient matrix-free implementation of the framework and conduct it on the standard test images and real-world measurement data. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a significant improvement of the reconstruction quality relative to the conventional CS setting.",

Experimentally, streamers are generated in a plate-plate geometry with a protruding needle. We are able to capture the complete time evolution of reproducible single-filament streamers with a ns gate-time camera. A 2D axisymmetric drift-diffusion-reaction fluid model is used to simulate streamers under conditions closely matching those of the experiments. Streamer velocities, radii and light emission profiles are compared between model and experiment. Good qualitative agreement is observed between the experimental and simulated optical emission profiles, and for the streamer velocity and radius. Quantitatively, the simulated streamer velocity is about 20% to 30% lower at the same streamer length, and the simulated radius is about 1 mm (20% to 30%) smaller. The effect of various parameters on the agreement between model and experiment is studied, such as the used transport data, the background ionization level, the photoionization rate, the gas temperature, the voltage rise time and the voltage boundary conditions. An increase in gas temperature due to the 50 Hz experimental repetition frequency could probably account for some of the observed discrepancies.",

        "abstract": "Background: Network Analysis (NA) is a method that has been used in various disciplines such as Social sciences and Ecology for decades. So far, NA has not been used extensively in studies of medication use. Only a handful of papers have used NA in Drug Prescription Networks (DPN). We provide an introduction to NA terminology alongside a guide to creating and extracting results from the medication networks. Objective: To introduce the readers to NA as a tool to study medication use by demonstrating how to apply different NA measures on 3 generated medication networks. Methods: We used the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD) to create a network that describes the co-medication in elderly persons in Norway on January 1, 2013. We used the Norwegian Electronic Prescription Support System (FEST) to create another network of severe drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Lastly, we created a network combining the two networks to show the actual use of drugs with severe DDIs. We used these networks to elucidate how to apply and interpret different network measures in medication networks. Results: Interactive network graphs are made available online, Stata and R syntaxes are provided. Various useful network measures for medication networks were applied such as network topological features, modularity analysis and centrality measures. Edge lists data used to generate the networks are openly available for readers in an open data repository to explore and use. Conclusion: We believe that NA can be a useful tool in medication use studies. We have provided information and hopefully inspiration for other researchers to use NA in their own projects. While network analyses are useful for exploring and discovering structures in medication use studies, it also has limitations. It can be challenging to interpret and it is not suitable for hypothesis testing.",

In this context, Age of Information (AoI) has been increasingly utilized as a metric that is more representative than latency in the context of systems with a sense-compute-actuate cycle. Nevertheless, AoI is commonly defined for a single communication direction, Downlink or Uplink, which does not capture the closed-loop dynamics. In this paper, we extend the concept of AoI by defining a new metric, Age of Loop (AoL), relevant for WNCS closed-loop systems. The AoL is defined as the time elapsed since the piece of information causing the latest action or state (depending on the selected time origin) was generated. We then use the proposed metric to learn the WNCS latency and freshness bounds and we apply such learning methodology to minimize the long term WNCS cost with the least amount of bandwidth. We show that, using the AoL, we can learn the control system requirement and use this information to optimize network resources.",

To support credible inference on novel interventions at the end of the study, nonetheless, we still want to construct valid confidence intervals on average treatment effects, subgroup effects, or value of new policies. The adaptive nature of the data collected by contextual bandit algorithms, however, makes this difficult: standard estimators are no longer asymptotically normally distributed and classic confidence intervals fail to provide correct coverage. While this has been addressed in non-contextual settings by using stabilized estimators, the contextual setting poses unique challenges that we tackle for the first time in this paper. We propose the Contextual Adaptive Doubly Robust (CADR) estimator, the first estimator for policy value that is asymptotically normal under contextual adaptive data collection. The main technical challenge in constructing CADR is designing adaptive and consistent conditional standard deviation estimators for stabilization. Extensive numerical experiments using 57 OpenML datasets demonstrate that confidence intervals based on CADR uniquely provide correct coverage.",

Often a perturbation initiated in one unit spreads to other units whose dynamical state they transiently alter. The maximum state changes at those units and the timings of these changes constitute key characteristics of such transient response dynamics. However, even for linear dynamical systems it is not possible to analytically determine time and amplitude of the maximal response of a unit to a perturbation. Here, we propose to extract approximate peak times and amplitudes from effective expectation values used to characterize the typical time and magnitude of the response of a unit by interpreting the system's response as a probability distribution over time. We derive analytic estimators for the peak response based on these expectation value measures in linearized systems operating close to a stable fixed point. These estimators can be expressed in terms of the inverse of the system's Jacobian. We obtain identical results with different approximations for the response dynamics, indicating that these estimators become exact in the limit of weak coupling. Furthermore, the results suggest that perturbations spread ballistically in networks with diffusive coupling.",

As it is unlikely to collect huge dialogue data for dialogue-oriented pre-training, in this paper, we propose three strategies to simulate the conversation features on general plain text. Our proposed method differs from existing post-training methods that it may yield a general-purpose PrLM and does not individualize to any detailed task while keeping the capability of learning dialogue related features including speaker awareness, continuity and consistency. The resulted Dialog-PrLM is fine-tuned on three public multi-turn dialogue datasets and helps achieve significant and consistent improvement over the plain PrLMs.",

For the bulk-corner correspondence case, we demonstrate the existence of the mobility gaps and clarify the related topological invariant that characterizes the mobility gap. Furthermore, we find that, while the system preserves the bulk-corner correspondence in the presence of disorder, the corner states are protected by the mobility gap instead of the bulk gap. For the edge-corner correspondence case, we show that the bulk mobility gap and edge band gaps of HOTIs are no longer closed simultaneously. Therefore, a rich phase diagram is obtained, including various disorder-induced phase transition processes. Notably, a disorder-induced transition from the non-trivial to trivial phase is realized, distinguishing the HOTIs from the other topological states. Our results deepen the understanding of bulk-boundary correspondence and enrich the topological phase transitions of disordered HOTIs.",

At low temperatures and sufficiently large area fractions, big particles form solid clusters stabilized by the osmotic pressure of thesurrounding fluid of small particles. At higher temperatures the solid gradually melts and a homogeneous phase of big and small particles results. We show that increasing temperature enhances the interpenetration and reduces the effective radii of big particles. We argue that the resulting change of balance of free volume and mixing contributions to the entropy is responsible for the melting of the big particle solid.

Essentially, the method generates an Assembly Task Sequence Graph (ATSG) by recognizing a graphical instruction manual. An ATSG is a graph describing the assembly task procedure by detecting types of parts included in the instruction images, completing the missing information automatically, and correcting the detection errors automatically. To build an ATSG, the proposed method first extracts the information of the parts contained in each image of the graphical instruction manual. Then, by using the extracted part information, it estimates the proper work motions and tools for the assembly task. After that, the method builds an ATSG by considering the relationship between the previous and following images, which makes it possible to estimate the undetected parts caused by occlusion using the information of the entire image series. Finally, by collating the total number of each part with the generated ATSG, the excess or deficiency of parts are investigated, and task procedures are removed or added according to those parts. In the experiment section, we build an ATSG using the proposed method to a graphical instruction manual for a chair and demonstrate the action sequences found in the ATSG can be performed by a dual-arm robot execution. The results show the proposed method is effective and simplifies robot teaching in automatic assembly.",

The latter quantity can be calculated either numerically using recombination codes or via fitting functions, such as the one by Eisenstein and Hu (EH), made via grids of parameters of the recombination history. Here we quantify the accuracy of these expressions and show that they can strongly bias the derived constraints on the cosmological parameters using BAO data. Then, using a machine learning approach, called the genetic algorithms, we proceed to derive new analytic expressions for $r_\\mathrm{s}(z_\\mathrm{d})$ which are accurate at the $\\sim0.003\\%$ level in a range of $10\\sigma$ around the Planck 2018 best-fit or $\\sim0.018\\%$ in a much broader range, compared to $\\sim 2-4\\%$ for the EH expression, thus obtaining an improvement of two to three orders of magnitude. Moreover, we also provide fits that include the effects of massive neutrinos and an extension to the concordance cosmological model assuming variations of the fine structure constant. Finally, we note that our expressions can be used to ease the computational cost required to compute $r_\\mathrm{s}(z_\\mathrm{d})$ with a Boltzmann code when deriving cosmological constraints from current and upcoming surveys.",

The chiral symmetry that plays a fundamental role in the nonperturbative physics in the strong interaction is anticipated to add restrictive effects on the symmetry potentials and in-medium NN cross sections. For comparison, we also perform the study with the usual relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. The numerical results with the NJL and RMF models are similar at saturation density and below, since a priori fit was made to saturation properties. With the increase of nuclear density, the chiral symmetry starts to be restored partially in the NJL model, resulting in the explicit fall of the scalar density. In a large energy span, the symmetry potential acquires a significant rise for the partial restoration of the chiral symmetry, compared to the one with the RMF model. It is found that the in-medium NN cross sections in the RIA with the NJL and RMF models both increase with the density in the energy region interested in this study, whereas those with the NJL model increase sharply as long as a clear chiral symmetry restoration takes place. The different tendency of observables in density can be transmitted to the different energy dependence in the RIA. The NJL model is shown to have characteristic energy-dependent symmetry potentials and NN cross sections beyond saturation point, apart from the RMF models.",

In the presence of a strong attractive interaction between B and N dopant atoms, the electron charge distribution is highly localized along the B-N bonds, while for a weaker attractive interaction the electrons are delocalized along the entire hexagonal ring of BC$_6$N. Furthermore, when both B and N atoms are doped at the same site of the hexagon, the breaking of the sub-lattice symmetry is low producing a small bandgap. In contrast, if the dopant atoms are at different sites, a high sub-lattice symmetry breaking is found leading to a large bandgap. The influences of electron localization/delocalization and the tunable bandgap on thermal behaviors such as the electronic thermal conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and the figure of merit, and optical properties such as the dielectric function, the excitation spectra, the refractive index, the electron energy loss spectra, the reflectivity, and the optical conductivity are presented. An enhancement with a red shift of the optical conductivity at low energy range is seen while a reduction at the high energy range is found indicating that the BC$_6$N structure may be useful for optoelectronic devices in the low energy, visible range.",

To this end, we first present a feasibility condition which guarantees that each user's noiseless signal is placed in the desired decision region.

        "abstract": "The increased temporal and spectral resolution of oversampled systems allows many sensor-signal analysis tasks to be performed (e.g. detection, classification and tracking) using a filterbank of low-pass digital differentiators. Such filters are readily designed via flatness constraints on the derivatives of the complex frequency response at dc, pi and at the centre frequencies of narrowband interferers, i.e. using maximally-flat (MaxFlat) designs. Infinite-impulse-response (IIR) filters are ideal in embedded online systems with high data-rates because computational complexity is independent of their (fading) memory. A novel procedure for the design of MaxFlat IIR filterbanks with improved passband phase linearity is presented in this paper, as a possible alternative to Kalman and Wiener filters in a class of derivative-state estimation problems with uncertain signal models. Butterworth poles are used for configurable bandwidth and guaranteed stability. Flatness constraints of arbitrary order are derived for temporal derivatives of arbitrary order and a prescribed group delay. As longer lags (in samples) are readily accommodated in oversampled systems, an expression for the optimal group delay that minimizes the white-noise gain (i.e. the error variance of the derivative estimate at steady state) is derived. Filter zeros are optimally placed for the required passband phase response and the cancellation of narrowband interferers in the stopband, by solving a linear system of equations. Low complexity filterbank realizations are discussed then their behaviour is analysed in a Teager-Kaiser operator to detect pulsed signals and in a state observer to track manoeuvring targets in simulated scenarios.",

Recently, several methods and techniques have been proposed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus using different images and data. However, this is the first study that will explore the possibility of using deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models to detect COVID-19 from electrocardiogram (ECG) trace images. In this work, COVID-19 and other cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) were detected using deep-learning techniques. A public dataset of ECG images consists of 1937 images from five distinct categories, such as Normal, COVID-19, myocardial infarction (MI), abnormal heartbeat (AHB), and recovered myocardial infarction (RMI) were used in this study. Six different deep CNN models (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionV3, DenseNet201, and MobileNetv2) were used to investigate three different classification schemes: two-class classification (Normal vs COVID-19); three-class classification (Normal, COVID-19, and Other CVDs), and finally, five-class classification (Normal, COVID-19, MI, AHB, and RMI). For two-class and three-class classification, Densenet201 outperforms other networks with an accuracy of 99.1%, and 97.36%, respectively; while for the five-class classification, InceptionV3 outperforms others with an accuracy of 97.83%. ScoreCAM visualization confirms that the networks are learning from the relevant area of the trace images. Since the proposed method uses ECG trace images which can be captured by smartphones and are readily available facilities in low-resources countries, this study will help in faster computer-aided diagnosis of COVID-19 and other cardiac abnormalities.",

The most important properties being that $RHom_{\\mathcal H}(-,{\\mathcal H})$ is concentrated in a single degree for irreducible representations and that it gives rise to Schneider--Stuhler duality for Ext groups (a Serre functor like property). Along the way we also study Grothendieck--Serre duality with respect to the Bernstein center and provide a proof of the folklore result that on admissible modules this functor is nothing but the contragredient duality. We single out a necessary and sufficient condition for when these three dualities agree on finite length modules in a given block. In particular, we show this is the case for all cuspidal blocks as well as, due to a result of Roche, on all blocks with trivial stabilizer in the relative Weyl group.",

In contrast to isostructural Cr-based compounds, the zero-field ground state is not a nonmagnetic $S=0$ singlet-dimer state. Instead, the Fe$_2$Br$_9$ bi-octahedra host semiclassical $S=5/2$ Fe$^{3+}$ spins with a pronounced easy-axis anisotropy along $c$ and interestingly, the intra-dimer spins are ordered ferromagnetically. The high degree of magnetic frustration due to (various) competing intra- and inter-dimer couplings leads to a surprisingly rich magnetic phase diagram. Already the zero-field ground state is reached via an intermediate phase, and the high-field magnetization and thermal expansion data for $H\\parallel c$ identify ten different ordered phases. Among them are phases with constant magnetization of 1/3, respectively 1/2 of the saturation value, and several transitions are strongly hysteretic with pronounced length changes reflecting strong magnetoelastic coupling.",

Here, assuming that a rubble-pile asteroid is scattered inside a WD's Roche lobe by a planet, we study its tidal disruption and the long-term evolution of the resulting fragments. We find that after a few pericentric passages, the asteroid is shredded into its constituent particles, forming a flat, thin ring. On a timescale of Myr, tens of per cent of the particles are scattered onto the WD. Fragment mutual collisions are most effective for coplanar fragments, and are thus only important in $10^3-10^4$ yr before the orbital coplanarity is broken by the planet. We show that for a rubble pile asteroid with a size frequency distribution of the component particles following that of the near earth objects, it has to be roughly at least 10 km in radius such that enough fragments are generated and $\\ge10\\%$ of its mass is lost to mutual collisions. At relative velocities of tens of km/s, such collisions grind down the tidal fragments into smaller and smaller dust grains. The WD radiation forces may shrink those grains' orbits, forming a dust disk. Tidal disruption of a monolithic asteroid creates large km-size fragments, and only parent bodies $\\ge100$ km are able to generate enough fragments for mutual collisions to be significant.",

For any squeezing degree, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the ghost image can be enhanced by the non-Gaussian operations of photon addition and subtraction on the two-mode squeezed light source. We find striking evidence that using non-Gaussian coherent operations, the SNR can be promoted to a high level even within the extremely weak squeezing regime.

However, losses are generated on-the-fly based on the model being trained with noisy labels, and thus large-loss data are likely but not certainly to be incorrect. There are actually two possibilities of a large-loss data point: (a) it is mislabeled, and then its loss decreases slower than other data, since deep neural networks \"learn patterns first\"; (b) it belongs to an underrepresented group of data and has not been selected yet. In this paper, we incorporate the uncertainty of losses by adopting interval estimation instead of point estimation of losses, where lower bounds of the confidence intervals of losses derived from distribution-free concentration inequalities, but not losses themselves, are used for sample selection. In this way, we also give large-loss but less selected data a try; then, we can better distinguish between the cases (a) and (b) by seeing if the losses effectively decrease with the uncertainty after the try. As a result, we can better explore underrepresented data that are correctly labeled but seem to be mislabeled at first glance. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to baselines and robust to a broad range of label noise types.",

        "abstract": "Over the last few years of the heyday of hybrid halide perovskites, so many metal cations additives have been tested to improve their optoelectronic properties that it is already difficult to find an element that has not yet been tried. In general, the variety of these approaches is united under the name \"doping\", however, there is currently no clear understanding of the mechanisms of the influence of the metal ion additives on the properties of the lead halide perovskite materials. For many ions there is even no consensus on the most fundamental questions: what lattice position does a given ion occupy and is it incorporated in the structure at all? Here, we derived a system of effective radii of different metal ions in the iodine environment for the set of iodide compounds and reveal their crystal chemical role in the APbI3 perovskites. We analysed the possible lattice positions for 40 most common monovalent, divalent, and trivalent metals to reveal whether they could successfully enter into the perovskite structures. We show that, at most, three parameters - effective size, electronegativity and the softness of metal ions are the main ones for crystal chemical analysis of the possibility of metal doping of hybrid halide perovskites. Our results provide a useful theoretical guidance to rationalize and improve current doping strategies of hybrid halide perovskites with metal ions.",

Capturing Brownian drift is done most efficiently through a judiciously constructed time-integration scheme that automatically accounts for its contribution to particle motion. In this paper, we present a generalised drift-correcting (gDC) scheme that accounts for Brownian drift for suspensions of rigid particles with arbitrary shape. The scheme seamlessly integrates with fast methods for computing the hydrodynamic interactions and random increments and requires a single full mobility solve per time-step. As a result, the gDC provides increased computational efficiency when used in conjunction with grid-based methods that employ fluctuating hydrodynamics to obtain the random increments. Further, for these methods the additional computations that the scheme requires occur at the level of individual particles, and hence lend themselves naturally to parallel computation. We perform a series of simulations that demonstrate the gDC obtains similar levels of accuracy as compared with the existing state-of-the-art. In addition, these simulations illustrate the gDC's applicability to a wide array of relevant problems involving Brownian suspensions of non-spherical particles, such as the structure of liquid crystals and the rheology of complex fluids.",

The current industrial works are also mainly focused on the basic category classification task based on the appearances of objects. The feature detection methods for the abstract category remains blank. A data structure that includes the information of video frames, audio spectrum and texts provide a new direction to explore. The multimodal models are proposed to make this in-depth video understanding mission possible. In this paper, we analyze the difficulties in abstract understanding of videos and propose a multimodal structure to obtain state-of-the-art performance in this field. Then we select several benchmarks for multimodal video understanding and apply the most suitable model to find the best performance. At last, we evaluate the overall spotlights and drawbacks of the models and methods in this paper and point out the possible directions for further improvements.",

This method provides approximate scattering solutions at multiple scattering energies simultaneously. We therefore utilise a graphics processing unit (GPU) to explore the benefits of this inherent parallelism. From a theoretical perspective, the WPCD method promises a speedup compared to a standard matrix-inversion method. We use the chiral NNLO$_{\\rm opt}$ interaction to demonstrate that WPCD enables efficient computation of NN scattering amplitudes provided one can tolerate an averaged method error of $~1-5$ mb in the total cross section. For scattering energies $\\gtrsim 40$ MeV, in the laboratory frame of reference, we find a much smaller method error of $\\lesssim 1$ mb. By increasing the number of wave-packets we can further reduce the overall method error. However, the parallel leverage of the WPCD method will be offset by the increased size of the resulting discretisation mesh. In practice, the GPU implementation is only useful for matrices that fit in the fast on-chip shared memory. Nevertheless, we find that WPCD is a promising method for computationally efficient, statistical analyses of EFT nuclear interactions, where we can utilise Bayesian inference methods to incorporate relevant uncertainties.",

Lots of approaches, e.g., loss correction and label correction, cannot handle such open-set noisy labels well, since they need training data and test data to share the same label space, which does not hold for learning with open-set noisy labels. The state-of-the-art methods thus employ the sample selection approach to handle open-set noisy labels, which tries to select clean data from noisy data for network parameters updates. The discarded data are seen to be mislabeled and do not participate in training. Such an approach is intuitive and reasonable at first glance. However, a natural question could be raised \"can such data only be discarded during training?\". In this paper, we show that the answer is no. Specifically, we discuss that the instances of discarded data could consist of some meaningful information for generalization. For this reason, we do not abandon such data, but use instance correction to modify the instances of the discarded data, which makes the predictions for the discarded data consistent with given labels. Instance correction are performed by targeted adversarial attacks. The corrected data are then exploited for training to help generalization. In addition to the analytical results, a series of empirical evidences are provided to justify our claims.",

In the last years, several authors have proposed sophisticated statistical approaches to forecast the ambulance dispatches, typically modelling the events as a point pattern occurring on a planar region. Nevertheless, ambulance interventions can be more appropriately modelled as a realisation of a point process occurring along a network of lines, such as a road network. The constrained spatial domain raises specific challenges and unique methodological problems that cannot be ignored when developing a proper statistical model. Hence, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal model to analyse the ambulance interventions that occurred in the road network of Milan (Italy) from 2015 to 2017. We adopt a non-separable first-order intensity function with spatial and temporal terms. The temporal component is estimated semi-parametrically using a Poisson regression model, while the spatial dimension is estimated nonparametrically using a network kernel function. A set of weights is included in the spatial term to capture space-time interactions, inducing non-separability in the intensity function. A series of maps and graphical tests show that our approach successfully models the ambulance interventions and captures the space-time patterns.",

Especially in this presumed sentential RE setting, the context of a single sentence is often sparse. This paper introduces the KGPool method to address this sparsity, dynamically expanding the context with additional facts from the KG. It learns the representation of these facts (entity alias, entity descriptions, etc.) using neural methods, supplementing the sentential context. Unlike existing methods that statically use all expanded facts, KGPool conditions this expansion on the sentence. We study the efficacy of KGPool by evaluating it with different neural models and KGs (Wikidata and NYT Freebase). Our experimental evaluation on standard datasets shows that by feeding the KGPool representation into a Graph Neural Network, the overall method is significantly more accurate than state-of-the-art methods.",

The existing literature lists many desirable properties for explanations to be useful, but there is no consensus on how to quantitatively evaluate explanations in practice. Moreover, explanations are typically used only to inspect black-box models, and the proactive use of explanations as a decision support is generally overlooked. Among the many approaches to XAI, a widely adopted paradigm is Local Linear Explanations - with LIME and SHAP emerging as state-of-the-art methods. We show that these methods are plagued by many defects including unstable explanations, divergence of actual implementations from the promised theoretical properties, and explanations for the wrong label. This highlights the need to have standard and unbiased evaluation procedures for Local Linear Explanations in the XAI field. In this paper we address the problem of identifying a clear and unambiguous set of metrics for the evaluation of Local Linear Explanations. This set includes both existing and novel metrics defined specifically for this class of explanations. All metrics have been included in an open Python framework, named LEAF. The purpose of LEAF is to provide a reference for end users to evaluate explanations in a standardised and unbiased way, and to guide researchers towards developing improved explainable techniques.",

Such MGTs are constructed for Lagrange densities with two non-Riemannian volume forms (two-measure theories, TMTs) and associated bimetric/ biconnection geometric structures. For conventional 2+2 splitting, we can describe such models in Finsler like variables, which is important for elaborating geometric methods of constructing exact and parametric solutions. Such formulations of general relativity, GR, and MGTs are considered for Lorentz manifolds and their (co) tangent bundles, in brief, FTMT. Off-diagonal metrics solving gravitational field equations in FTMTs are determined by generating functions, effective sources and integration constants and characterized by nonholonomic frame torsion effects. Restricting the class of integration functions, we can extract torsionless and diagonal configurations and model emergent cosmological theories with square scalar curvature, $R^2$, when the global Weyl-scale symmetry is broken via nonlinear dynamical interactions with nonholonomic constraints. In the physical Einstein-Finsler frame, the constructions involve (i) nonlinear re-parametrization symmetries of the generating functions and effective sources; (ii) effective potentials for the scalar field with possible two flat regions which allows a unified description of locally anisotropic and/or isotropic early universe inflation related to acceleration cosmology and dark energy; (iii) there are \"emergent universes\" described by (off-) diagonal solutions for certain nonholonomic phases and parametric cosmological evolution resulting in various inflationary phases; (iv) we can reproduce in two-measure theories massive gravity effects.",

The GIR is similar to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (FIR) and takes place as the next stage in the development of humanity in the perception of both machines and devices and the natural environment. The processes of the GIR in the European Union can be identified based on selected indicators of Sustainable Development (SD), in particular with the use of indicators of the Green Economy (GE) using taxonomic methods and regression analysis. The GM strives to implement the idea of the SD in many areas, to transform the whole economy, and elements of this process are visible Green Labour Market (GLM).

This is also important for the university performance assessment when its graduates can easily find jobs in the labor market.

Additionally, there is business environment pressure to transform workplaces and whole organizations towards a more green and sustainable form. Green Jobs (GJ) are the elements of the whole economic transformation. This change is based on the green qualifications and green careers which translate theoretical assumptions into business language. Therefore, the choice of future career path is based on specified criteria, which were examined by surveys performed among graduates by the career office at Wroclaw University of Technology (WUT) in Poland. The aim of this article was to address the question about the most significant criteria of green career paths among graduates of WUT in 2019. Special attention was paid to the GJ understood as green careers. In this article, the multi-criteria Bellinger method was explained, presented, and then used to analyze chosen factors of choice graduates career paths and then compared with Gale-Shapley algorithm results in a comparative analysis. Future research can develop a graduate profile willing to be employed in GJ.",

We consider the Haldane-Hubbard model with the noninteracting lower bands in a nearly-flat band limit, previously determined for the spinless model, and at 1/4-filling of its corresponding noninteracting limit. Within the bosonization scheme, the Haldane-Hubbard model is mapped into an effective interacting boson model, whose quadratic term allows us to determine the spin-wave spectrum at the harmonic approximation. We show that the excitation spectrum has two branches with a Goldstone mode and Dirac points at center and at the K and K' points of the first Brillouin zone, respectively. We also consider the effects on the spin-wave spectrum due to an energy offset in the on-site Hubbard repulsion energies and due to the presence of an staggered on-site energy term, both quantities associated with the two triangular sublattices. In both cases, we find that an energy gap opens at the K and K' points. Moreover, we also find some evidences for an instability of the flat-band ferromagnetic phase in the presence of the staggered on-site energy term. We provide some additional results for the square lattice topological Hubbard model previous studied within the bosonization formalism and comment on the differences between the bosonization scheme implementation for the correlated Chern insulators on both square and honeycomb lattices.",

We introduce a map ${\\rm r}_{\\mathfrak{p}, \\mathfrak{q}}$ from $\\mathsf{tors}(\\Lambda\\otimes_R \\kappa(\\mathfrak{p}))$ to $\\mathsf{tors}(\\Lambda\\otimes_R \\kappa(\\mathfrak{q}))$ for a pair $\\mathfrak{p} \\supseteq \\mathfrak{q}$ of prime ideals of $R$, and call $\\{ \\mathcal{X}^{\\mathfrak{p}} \\}\\in\\mathbb{T}_R(\\Lambda)$ compatible if ${\\rm r}_{\\mathfrak{p}, \\mathfrak{q}}(\\mathcal{X}^{\\mathfrak{p}})\\supseteq \\mathcal{X}^{\\mathfrak{q}}$ holds for such pair. We show that all elements in the image of $\\Phi$ are compatible, and call $(R, \\Lambda)$ compatible if the converse holds. We study when $(R, \\Lambda)$ is compatible. We show that, if $R$ is semi-local and $\\dim R \\leq 1$, then $(R, \\Lambda)$ is compatible. We also give a sufficient condition in terms of silting $\\Lambda$-modules. As an application, for a Dynkin quiver $Q$, $(R, RQ)$ is compatible and we have a poset isomorphism $\\mathsf{tors} RQ \\simeq \\mathsf{Hom}_{\\rm poset}(\\mathsf{Spec} R, \\mathfrak{C}_Q)$ for the Cambrian lattice $\\mathfrak{C}_Q$ of $Q$.",

        "abstract": "Cybersecurity risk analysis plays an essential role in supporting organizations make effective decision about how to manage and control cybersecurity risk. Cybersecurity risk is a function of the interplay between the defender, i.e., the organisation, and the attacker: decisions and actions made by the defender second guess the decisions and actions taken by the attacker and vice versa. Insight into this game between these two agents provides a means for the defender to identify and make optimal decisions. To date, the adversarial risk analysis framework has provided a decision-analytical approach to solve such game problems in the presence of uncertainty and uses Monte Carlo simulation to calculate and identify optimal decisions. We propose an alternative framework to construct and solve a serial of sequential Defend-Attack models, that incorporates the adversarial risk analysis approach, but uses a new class of influence diagrams algorithm, called hybrid Bayesian network inference, to identify optimal decision strategies. Compared to Monte Carlo simulation the proposed hybrid Bayesian network inference is more versatile because it provides an automated way to compute hybrid Defend-Attack models and extends their use to involve mixtures of continuous and discrete variables, of any kind. More importantly, the hybrid Bayesian network approach is novel in that it supports dynamic decision making whereby new real-time observations can update the Defend-Attack model in practice. We also extend the Defend-Attack model to support cases involving extra variables and longer decision sequence. Examples are presented, illustrating how the proposed framework can be adjusted for more complicated scenarios, including dynamic decision making.",

Previous work in adding strong privacy protection to GPs via differential privacy (DP) has been limited to protecting only the privacy of the prediction targets (model outputs) but not inputs. We break this limitation by introducing GPs with DP protection for both model inputs and outputs. We achieve this by using sparse GP methodology and publishing a private variational approximation on known inducing points. The approximation covariance is adjusted to approximately account for the added uncertainty from DP noise. The approximation can be used to compute arbitrary predictions using standard sparse GP techniques. We propose a method for hyperparameter learning using a private selection protocol applied to validation set log-likelihood. Our experiments demonstrate that given sufficient amount of data, the method can produce accurate models under strong privacy protection.",

Applying Gaussian process regressions to the K2 light curves and the near-infrared (NIR) light curves observed with the IRSF 1.4-m telescope, we derive the wavelength dependences of the photometric signals due to stellar activity. To estimate the temporal variations in the photometric variability amplitudes between the two observation periods of K2 and IRSF, separated by more than 2 years, we analyze a number of K2 targets in Hyades that have also been observed in Campaigns 4 and 13 and find a representative variation rate over 2 years of 38%pm71%. Taking this temporal variation into account, we constrain projected sizes and temperature contrast properties of the starspots in the stellar photosphere to be approximately 10% and 0.95, respectively. These starspot properties can induce relatively large differences in the variability amplitude over different observational passbands, and we find that radial-velocity jitter may be more suppressed in the NIR than previously expected. Our result supports profits of on-going exoplanet search projects that are attempting to detect or confirm young planets in open clusters via radial-velocity measurements in the NIR.",

These model architectures are typically deep, resulting in slow training and inference, especially for long inputs. To improve efficiency while maintaining a high accuracy, we propose a new architecture, DoT, a double transformer model, that decomposes the problem into two sub-tasks: A shallow pruning transformer that selects the top-K tokens, followed by a deep task-specific transformer that takes as input those K tokens. Additionally, we modify the task-specific attention to incorporate the pruning scores. The two transformers are jointly trained by optimizing the task-specific loss. We run experiments on three benchmarks, including entailment and question-answering. We show that for a small drop of accuracy, DoT improves training and inference time by at least 50%. We also show that the pruning transformer effectively selects relevant tokens enabling the end-to-end model to maintain similar accuracy as slower baseline models. Finally, we analyse the pruning and give some insight into its impact on the task model.",

In such a scheme, each file in the data center or library is usually divided into a number of packets to pursue a low broadcasting rate based on the designed placements at each user's cache. However, the implementation complexity of this scheme increases as the number of packets increases. Therefore, it is crucial to design a scheme with a small subpacketization, while maintaining a relatively low transmission rate. In this paper, a placement delivery array (PDA) scheme that works with flexible memory sizes is proposed, and then it is generalized to fit more scenarios. It is shown that the subpacketization level can be decreased while maintaining the same number of users, memory ratio and transmission rate.",

In this work we discuss a variant of the Scotogenic model that includes charged fermions and a doublet with hypercharge $3/2$. Neutrino masses are induced at the one-loop level thanks to the states belonging to the dark sector. However, in contrast to the standard Scotogenic model, only the scalar dark matter candidate is viable in this version. After presenting the model and explaining some particularities about neutrino mass generation, we concentrate on its dark matter phenomenology. We show that the observed dark matter relic density can be correctly reproduced in the usual parameter space regions found for the standard Scotogenic model or the Inert Doublet model. In addition, the presence of the charged fermions may open up new regions, provided some tuning of the parameters is allowed.",

        "abstract": "The analogies between economics and classical mechanics can be extended from constrained optimization to constrained dynamics by formalizing economic (constraint) forces and economic power in analogy to physical (constraint) forces in Lagrangian mechanics. In the differential-algebraic equation framework of General Constrained Dynamics (GCD), households, firms, banks, and the government employ forces to change economic variables according to their desire and their power to assert their interest. These ex-ante forces are completed by constraint forces from unanticipated system constraints to yield the ex-post dynamics. The flexible out-of-equilibrium model can combine Keynesian concepts such as the balance sheet approach and slow adaptation of prices and quantities with bounded rationality (gradient climbing) and interacting agents discussed in behavioral economics and agent-based models. The framework integrates some elements of different schools of thought and overcomes some restrictions inherent to optimization approaches, such as the assumption of markets operating in or close to equilibrium. Depending on the parameter choice for power relations and adaptation speeds, the model nevertheless can converge to a neoclassical equilibrium, and reacts to an austerity shock in a neoclassical or post-Keynesian way.",

Polymer flexibility is usually quantified by the persistent length, $\\ell_p$, which is defined as the length on which the bond-bond correlation is lost. Non-monotonic flexibility of polymeric complexes as a function of $\\eta$ has been interpreted as a cooperative effect under the Worm-Like Chain model. Instead of the usual exponential behavior, $\\langle C\\left(k\\right)\\rangle\\propto e^{-k/\\ell_p}$, here we show that the bond-bond correlation follows a power law decay, $\\langle C\\left(k\\right)\\rangle\\approx c_0k^{-\\omega}$. The power law regime holds even at the coil-globular transition, where a Gaussian limit is expected, originated from non-leading terms due to monomer-monomer connectivity. The exponent $\\omega$ monotonically converges to the \\mbox{SAW} limit for large $\\eta$, if the isotherm pathway is constructed at the coil phase.

The procedure is directly applicable to pseudoscalar meson photoproduction ($N = 4$ amplitudes) and electroproduction ($N = 6$ amplitudes), where in both cases it directly yields complete sets with a minimal length of $2 N$ observables. For the case of electroproduction, we give here for the first time an extensive list of complete sets composed of $2 N = 12$ observables. Furthermore, we sketch how the proposed procedure can be generalized to processes with a larger number of amplitudes, i.e. $N > 6$ amplitudes. We outline this procedure for the next more complicated example of two-meson photoproduction ($N = 8$ amplitudes).",

With the advances of deep learning, CNN-based methods have yielded promising results in generic object detection due to their powerful modeling capability. However, existing CNN-based methods cannot be directly applied for infrared small targets since pooling layers in their networks could lead to the loss of targets in deep layers. To handle this problem, we propose a dense nested attention network (DNANet) in this paper. Specifically, we design a dense nested interactive module (DNIM) to achieve progressive interaction among high-level and low-level features. With the repeated interaction in DNIM, infrared small targets in deep layers can be maintained. Based on DNIM, we further propose a cascaded channel and spatial attention module (CSAM) to adaptively enhance multi-level features. With our DNANet, contextual information of small targets can be well incorporated and fully exploited by repeated fusion and enhancement. Moreover, we develop an infrared small target dataset (namely, NUDT-SIRST) and propose a set of evaluation metrics to conduct comprehensive performance evaluation. Experiments on both public and our self-developed datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves better performance in terms of probability of detection (Pd), false-alarm rate (Fa), and intersection of union (IoU).",

For example, we are able to pinpoint impact locations on a held rod and tell apart different textures using a rigid probe. In this work, we consider how we can enable robots to have a similar capacity, i.e., to embody tools and extend perception using standard grasped objects. We propose that vibro-tactile sensing using dynamic tactile sensors on the robot fingers, along with machine learning models, enables robots to decipher contact information that is transmitted as vibrations along rigid objects. This paper reports on extensive experiments using the BioTac micro-vibration sensor and a new event dynamic sensor, the NUSkin, capable of multi-taxel sensing at 4~kHz. We demonstrate that fine localization on a held rod is possible using our approach (with errors less than 1 cm on a 20 cm rod). Next, we show that vibro-tactile perception can lead to reasonable grasp stability prediction during object handover, and accurate food identification using a standard fork. We find that multi-taxel vibro-tactile sensing at sufficiently high sampling rate (above 2 kHz) led to the best performance across the various tasks and objects. Taken together, our results provides both evidence and guidelines for using vibro-tactile perception to extend tactile perception, which we believe will lead to enhanced competency with tools and better physical human-robot-interaction.",

As wireless devices involved in FEEL are resource limited in terms of communication bandwidth, computing power and battery capacity, it is important to carefully schedule them to optimize the training performance. In this work, we consider an over-the-air FEEL system with analog gradient aggregation, and propose an energy-aware dynamic device scheduling algorithm to optimize the training performance under energy constraints of devices, where both communication energy for gradient aggregation and computation energy for local training are included. The consideration of computation energy makes dynamic scheduling challenging, as devices are scheduled before local training, but the communication energy for over-the-air aggregation depends on the l2-norm of local gradient, which is known after local training. We thus incorporate estimation methods into scheduling to predict the gradient norm. Taking the estimation error into account, we characterize the performance gap between the proposed algorithm and its offline counterpart. Experimental results show that, under a highly unbalanced local data distribution, the proposed algorithm can increase the accuracy by 4.9% on CIFAR-10 dataset compared with the myopic benchmark, while satisfying the energy constraints.",

Furthermore, we constrained our model with revised Hubble datasets consisting of 57 data points and newly published Pantheon samples with 1048 points to obtain the best fitting values of the model parameters. Our model is found to be in good agreement with observations. Furthermore, we analysed the cosmological behavior of the density parameter, the equation of state (EoS) parameter ($\\omega$), and the deceleration parameter ($q$). The universe appears to be evolving from a decelerated to an accelerated phase. The EoS parameter is further found to be in the quintessence phase, indicating that the universe is accelerating. We can deduce that the accumulation of bulk viscosity as effective dark energy is responsible for the current accelerated expansion of the universe.",

        "abstract": "Context. Homochirality is a generic and unique property of life on Earth and is considered a universal and agnostic biosignature. Homochirality induces fractional circular polarization in the incident light that it reflects. Because this circularly polarized light can be sensed remotely, it can be one of the most compelling candidate biosignatures in life detection missions. While there are also other sources of circular polarization, these result in spectrally flat signals with lower magnitude. Additionally, circular polarization can be a valuable tool in Earth remote sensing because the circular polarization signal directly relates to vegetation physiology. Aims. While high-quality circular polarization measurements can be obtained in the laboratory and under semi-static conditions in the field, there has been a significant gap to more realistic remote sensing conditions. Methods. In this study, we present sensitive circular spectropolarimetric measurements of various landscape elements taken from a fast-moving helicopter. Results. We demonstrate that during flight, within mere seconds of measurements, we can differentiate (S/N>5) between grass fields, forests, and abiotic urban areas. Importantly, we show that with only nonzero circular polarization as a discriminant, photosynthetic organisms can even be measured in lakes. Conclusions. Circular spectropolarimetry can be a powerful technique to detect life beyond Earth, and we emphasize the potential of utilizing circular spectropolarimetry as a remote sensing tool to characterize and monitor in detail the vegetation physiology and terrain features of Earth itself.",

One of the expected signatures of Majorana modes is the fractional 4$\\pi$ Josephson effect. Evidence in favor of this effect often comes from a.c. Josephson effect measurements and focuses on the observation of missing first or higher odd-numbered Shapiro steps. However, the disappearance of the odd Shapiro steps has also been reported in conventional Josephson junctions where no Majorana modes are expected. In this paper, we present a phenomenological model that displays suppression of the odd Shapiro steps. We perform resistively-shunted junction model calculations and introduce peaks in differential resistance as function of the bias current. In the presence of only the standard 2$\\pi$ Josephson current, for chosen values of peak positions and amplitudes, we can suppress the odd Shapiro steps, or any steps, thus providing a possible explanation for the observation of missing Shapiro steps.",

Especially for reducing the amounts of point cloud transmission, it is by predicting the intermediate frame based on the reference frames to upsample data to high frame rate ones. However, due to high-dimensional and sparse characteristics of point clouds, it is more difficult to predict the intermediate frame for LiDAR point clouds than videos. In this paper, we propose a novel LiDAR point cloud frame interpolation method, which exploits range images (RIs) as an intermediate representation with CNNs to conduct the frame interpolation process. Considering the inherited characteristics of RIs differ from that of color images, we introduce spatially adaptive convolutions to extract range features adaptively, while a high-efficient flow estimation method is presented to generate optical flows. The proposed model then warps the input frames and range features, based on the optical flows to synthesize the interpolated frame. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset have clearly demonstrated that our method consistently achieves superior frame interpolation results with better perceptual quality to that of using state-of-the-art video frame interpolation methods. The proposed method could be integrated into any LiDAR point cloud compression systems for inter prediction.",

The asymptotic behaviour of the Euler system in the limit of zero Mach and Froude numbers, and large friction is characterised by an additional scaling parameter. Depending on the values of this parameter, the Euler system relaxes towards a hyperbolic or a parabolic limit equation. Standard Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta schemes are incapable of switching between these asymptotic regimes. We propose a time semi-discretisation to obtain a unified scheme which is AP for the two different limits. A further reformulation of the semi-implicit scheme can be recast as a fully-explicit method in which the mass update contains both hyperbolic and parabolic fluxes. A space-time fully-discrete scheme is derived using a finite volume framework. A hydrostatic reconstruction strategy, an upwinding of the sources at the interfaces, and a careful choice of the central discretisation of the parabolic fluxes are used to achieve the well-balancing property for hydrostatic steady states. Results of several numerical case studies are presented to substantiate the theoretical claims and to verify the robustness of the scheme.",

The mathematical framework for our proposed CL is established. Using the public and authoritative dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed CL framework has three advantages, namely, the capability of adapting to the dynamic environment and tasks, the self-learning capability and the capability of 'good money driving out bad money' by taking modulation recognition as an example.

Since most OSPEs employ short answer or fill-in-the-blank style questions, the format requires many people familiar with the content to mark the exams. However, the increasing prevalence of online delivery for anatomy and physiology courses could result in students losing the OSPE practice that they would receive in face-to-face learning sessions. The purpose of this study was to test the accuracy of Decision Trees (DTs) in marking OSPE questions as a potential first step to creating an intelligent, online OSPE tutoring system. The study used the results of the winter 2020 semester final OSPE from McMaster University's anatomy and physiology course in the Faculty of Health Sciences (HTHSCI 2FF3/2LL3/1D06) as the data set. Ninety percent of the data set was used in a 10-fold validation algorithm to train a DT for each of the 54 questions. Each DT was comprised of unique words that appeared in correct, student-written answers. The remaining 10% of the data set was marked by the generated DTs. When the answers marked by the DT were compared to the answers marked by staff and faculty, the DT achieved an average accuracy of 94.49% across all 54 questions. This suggests that machine learning algorithms such as DTs are a highly effective option for OSPE grading and are suitable for the development of an intelligent, online OSPE tutoring system.",

Here, we investigated the photoemission and photocurrents from nanometric tungsten needle tips exposed to carrier-envelope phase-controlled few-cycle laser fields. We report a characteristic step-wise increase in the intensity-rescaled cutoff energies of emitted electrons beyond a certain intensity value. By comparison with simulations, we identify this feature as the onset of charge-interaction dominated photoemission dynamics. Our results are anticipated to be relevant also for the strong-field photoemission from other nanostructures, including photoemission from plasmonic nano-bowtie antennas used in carrier-envelope phase-detection and for PHz-scale devices.",

Recently, an approach to first map images downsampled by unknown filters to bicubicly downsampled look-alike images was proposed to successfully super-resolve such images. In this paper, we show that any inverse problem can be formulated by first mapping the input degraded images to an intermediate domain, and then training a second network to form output images from these intermediate images. Furthermore, the best intermediate domain may vary according to the task. Our experimental results demonstrate that this two-stage domain-adapted training strategy does not only achieve better results on a given class of unknown degradations but can also generalize to other unseen classes of degradations better.",

Such particles can have lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) couplings to the SM charged leptons. LFV ALPs provide the possibility to address some of the SM long-lasting problems. We investigate the sensitivity of a future muon collider suggested by the Muon Accelerator Program (MAP) to the production of LFV ALPs in the ALP mass range $m_a\\leq1$ MeV. ALPs are assumed to be produced through the LFV decay $\\tau\\rightarrow\\ell a$ ($\\ell=e,\\mu$) of one of the tau leptons produced in the muon-anti muon annihilation. Performing a realistic detector simulation and deploying a multivariate technique, we constrain the LFV couplings $c_{\\tau e}$ and $c_{\\tau \\mu}$ for both the cases of unpolarized and polarized muon beams. Three different chiral structures are considered for the LFV ALP coupling and the muon collider is assumed to operate at the center-of-mass energies of 126, 350 and 1500 GeV. We present an unprecedented procedure to search for LFV ALPs at colliders which takes advantage of tau polarization-induced effects. Polarized tau leptons which produce such effects can be produced when the initial muon beams are polarized. Utilizing the properties of polarized tau decays, the main SM background which overwhelms the ALP production in the case of unpolarized muon beams can be significantly suppressed. We present 95$\\%$ CL expected limits on the LFV couplings and show that the present analysis can improve current experimental limits on the ALP LFV couplings by roughly one order of magnitude. The presented idea of utilizing properties of polarized decays to improve the sensitivity can also be employed in similar collider searches.",

However, existing metrics have two major limitations: (a) they are mostly trained in a simplified two-level setting (coherent vs. incoherent), while humans give Likert-type multi-level coherence scores, dubbed as \"quantifiable\"; (b) their predicted coherence scores cannot align with the actual human rating standards due to the absence of human guidance during training. To address these limitations, we propose Quantifiable Dialogue Coherence Evaluation (QuantiDCE), a novel framework aiming to train a quantifiable dialogue coherence metric that can reflect the actual human rating standards. Specifically, QuantiDCE includes two training stages, Multi-Level Ranking (MLR) pre-training and Knowledge Distillation (KD) fine-tuning. During MLR pre-training, a new MLR loss is proposed for enabling the model to learn the coarse judgement of coherence degrees. Then, during KD fine-tuning, the pretrained model is further finetuned to learn the actual human rating standards with only very few human-annotated data. To advocate the generalizability even with limited fine-tuning data, a novel KD regularization is introduced to retain the knowledge learned at the pre-training stage. Experimental results show that the model trained by QuantiDCE presents stronger correlations with human judgements than the other state-of-the-art metrics.",

Due to the inherent structural properties (e.g., sparsity) existing in many signals of interest, compressive sensing (CS) technology has been extensively used for data collection in IoT to improve both accuracy and energy efficiency. Apart from the existing works which leverage CS as a channel coding scheme to deal with data loss during transmission, some recent results have started to employ CS as a source coding strategy. The frequently used projection matrices in these CS-based source coding schemes include dense random matrices (e.g., Gaussian matrices or Bernoulli matrices) and structured matrices (e.g., Toeplitz matrices). However, these matrices are either difficult to be implemented on resource-constrained IoT sensor nodes or have limited applicability. To address these issues, in this paper, we design a novel simple and efficient projection matrix, named sparse Gaussian matrix, which is easy and resource-saving to be implemented in practical IoT applications. We conduct both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation of the designed sparse Gaussian matrix. The results demonstrate that employing the designed projection matrix to perform CS-based source coding could significantly save time and memory cost while ensuring satisfactory signal recovery performance.",

On one hand, this transforms descriptions as given by, e.g., Fact Sheets or Model Cards, into a form that is well-suited for end-users. On the other hand, care labels are the result of a certification suite that tests whether stated guarantees hold. In this paper, we present two experiments with our certification suite. One shows the care labels for configurations of Markov random fields (MRFs). Based on the underlying theory of MRFs, each choice leads to its specific rating of static properties like, e.g., expressivity and reliability. In addition, the implementation is tested and resource consumption is measured yielding dynamic properties. This two-level procedure is followed by another experiment certifying deep neural network (DNN) models. There, we draw the static properties from the literature on a particular model and data set. At the second level, experiments are generated that deliver measurements of robustness against certain attacks. We illustrate this by ResNet-18 and MobileNetV3 applied to ImageNet.",

The study of graphs that have the PMH-property, initiated in the 1970s by Las Vergnas and H\u00e4ggkvist, combines three well-studied properties of graphs, namely matchings, Hamiltonicity and edge-colourings. In this work, we study these concepts for cubic graphs in an attempt to characterise those cubic graphs for which every perfect matching corresponds to one of the colours of a proper 3-edge-colouring of the graph. We discuss that this is equivalent to saying that such graphs are even-2-factorable (E2F), that is, all 2-factors of the graph contain only even cycles. The case for bipartite cubic graphs is trivial, since if $G$ is bipartite then it is E2F. Thus, we restrict our attention to non-bipartite cubic graphs. A sufficient, but not necessary, condition for a cubic graph to be E2F is that it has the PMH-property. The aim of this work is to introduce two infinite families of non-bipartite cubic graphs, which we term papillon graphs and unbalanced papillon graphs, and determine the values of their respective parameters for which these graphs have the PMH-property or are just E2F.",

        "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have dominated computer vision for years, due to its ability in capturing locality and translation invariance. Recently, many vision transformer architectures have been proposed and they show promising performance. A key component in vision transformers is the fully-connected self-attention which is more powerful than CNNs in modelling long range dependencies. However, since the current dense self-attention uses all image patches (tokens) to compute attention matrix, it may neglect locality of images patches and involve noisy tokens (e.g., clutter background and occlusion), leading to a slow training process and potentially degradation of performance. To address these problems, we propose a sparse attention scheme, dubbed k-NN attention, for boosting vision transformers. Specifically, instead of involving all the tokens for attention matrix calculation, we only select the top-k similar tokens from the keys for each query to compute the attention map. The proposed k-NN attention naturally inherits the local bias of CNNs without introducing convolutional operations, as nearby tokens tend to be more similar than others. In addition, the k-NN attention allows for the exploration of long range correlation and at the same time filter out irrelevant tokens by choosing the most similar tokens from the entire image. Despite its simplicity, we verify, both theoretically and empirically, that $k$-NN attention is powerful in distilling noise from input tokens and in speeding up training. Extensive experiments are conducted by using ten different vision transformer architectures to verify that the proposed k-NN attention can work with any existing transformer architectures to improve its prediction performance.",

Is this true? What if we could find, or create nuclei without protons? How far can we go in neutron richness? Our common sense tells us that these neutral nuclei should not exist, but if they do they would change our knowledge on neutron stars, on the properties of nuclei in general, and ultimately on the nucleon-nucleon interaction itself, the building block of matter. This huge potential impact has pushed some ambitious nuclear physicists to search for them since the 1960s. The first positive hints appeared only in the XXI century, and nowadays several collaborations are trying to corner these weird objects and give a definite answer to this crucial question. In this \\edit{review} we will go through this fascinating quest, that started with humble experiments and has now reached a stage of ambitious and sophisticated projects, both in experiment and theory.",

In contrast to the single-agent setting, the coordination indispensable in cooperative MARL constrains each agent's policy. However, existing transfer methods focus exclusively on agent policy and ignores coordination knowledge. We propose a new architecture that realizes robust coordination knowledge transfer through appropriate decomposition of the overall coordination into several coordination patterns. We use a novel mixing network named level-adaptive QTransformer (LA-QTransformer) to realize agent coordination that considers credit assignment, with appropriate coordination patterns for different agents realized by a novel level-adaptive Transformer (LA-Transformer) dedicated to the transfer of coordination knowledge. In addition, we use a novel agent network named Population Invariant agent with Transformer (PIT) to realize the coordination transfer in more varieties of scenarios. Extensive experiments in StarCraft II micro-management show that LA-QTransformer together with PIT achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art baselines.",

We calculate the transverse photoconductivity of 2DEG with parabolic and linear dispersion for short-range and Coulomb scatterers at different temperatures.

The onsite $U$ and intersite $V$ Hubbard parameters are computed using linear-response theory in the framework of density-functional perturbation theory. We show that while the inclusion of the onsite $U$ is crucial to describe the localized nature of the Mn($3d$) states, the intersite $V$ is key to capture accurately the strong hybridization between neighboring Mn($3d$) and O($2p$) states. In this framework, we stabilize the simplified collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering (suggested by the Goodenough-Kanamori rule) that is commonly used as an approximation to the experimentally-observed noncollinear screw-type spiral magnetic ordering. A detailed investigation of the ferromagnetic and of other three collinear AFM spin configurations is also presented. The findings from Hubbard-corrected DFT are discussed using two kinds of Hubbard manifolds - nonorthogonalized and orthogonalized atomic orbitals - showing that special attention must be given to the choice of the Hubbard projectors, with orthogonalized manifolds providing more accurate results than nonorthogonalized ones within DFT+$U$+$V$. This work paves the way for future studies of complex transition-metal compounds containing strongly localized electrons in the presence of pronounced covalent interactions.",

Here, we hierarchically analyze the ensemble of BBHs discovered by the LIGO and Virgo with a model that allows for intrinsic correlations between their mass ratios $q$ and effective inspiral spins $\\chi_\\mathrm{eff}$. At $98.7\\%$ credibility, we find that the mean of the $\\chi_\\mathrm{eff}$ distribution varies as a function of $q$, such that more unequal-mass BBHs exhibit systematically larger $\\chi_\\mathrm{eff}$. We find Bayesian odds ratio of $10.5$ in favor of a model that allows for such a correlation over one that does not. While many proposed astrophysical formation channels predict some degree correlation between spins and mass ratio, these predicted correlations typically act in an opposite sense to the trend we observationally identify in the data.",

We model the student performance as a dynamic problem and compare the two major classes of dynamic neural architectures for its solution, namely the finite-memory Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNN) and the potentially infinite-memory Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Since the next response is a function of the knowledge state of the student and this, in turn, is a function of their previous responses and the skills associated with the previous questions, we propose a two-part network architecture. The first part employs a dynamic neural network (either TDNN or RNN) to trace the student knowledge state. The second part applies on top of the dynamic part and it is a multi-layer feed-forward network which completes the classification task of predicting the student response based on our estimate of the student knowledge state. Both input skills and previous responses are encoded using different embeddings. Regarding the skill embeddings we tried two different initialization schemes using (a) random vectors and (b) pretrained vectors matching the textual descriptions of the skills. Our experiments show that the performance of the RNN approach is better compared to the TDNN approach in all datasets that we have used. Also, we show that our RNN architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art models in four out of five datasets. It is worth noting that the TDNN approach also outperforms the state of the art models in four out of five datasets, although it is slightly worse than our proposed RNN approach. Finally, contrary to our expectations, we find that the initialization of skill embeddings using pretrained vectors offers practically no advantage over random initialization.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) is generally acquired with full brain coverage, even though many QSM brain-iron studies focus on the deep grey matter (DGM) region only. Reducing the spatial coverage to the DGM vicinity can substantially shorten the scan time or enhance the spatial resolution without increasing scan time; however, this may lead to significant DGM susceptibility underestimation. Method: A recently proposed deep learning-based QSM method, namely xQSM, is investigated to assess the accuracy of dipole inversion on reduced brain coverages. Pre-processed magnetic field maps are extended symmetrically from the centre of globus pallidus in the coronal plane to simulate QSM acquisitions of difference spatial coverages.Results: The proposed xQSM network led to the lowest DGM contrast lost with the smallest susceptibility variation range across all spatial coverages. For the digital brain phantom simulation, xQSM improved the DGM susceptibility underestimation more than 20% in small spatial coverages. For the in vivo acquisition, less than 5% DGM susceptibility error was achieved in 48 mm axial slabs using the xQSM network, while a minimum of 112 mm coverage was required for conventional methods. It is also shown that the background field removal process performed worse in reduced brain coverages, which further deteriorated the subsequent dipole inversion. Conclusion: The recently proposed deep learning-based xQSM method significantly improves the accuracy of DGM QSM from small spatial coverages as compared with conventional QSM algorithms, which can shorten DGM QSM acquisition time substantially.",

Already, in models with only one or few parameters, the analytical posterior can only be determined in special settings. In Bayesian neural networks, variational inference is widely used to approximate difficult-to-compute posteriors by variational distributions. Usually, Gaussians are used as variational distributions (Gaussian-VI) which limits the quality of the approximation due to their limited flexibility. Transformation models on the other hand are flexible enough to fit any distribution. Here we present transformation model-based variational inference (TM-VI) and demonstrate that it allows to accurately approximate complex posteriors in models with one parameter and also works in a mean-field fashion for multi-parameter models like neural networks.",

In this paper, we investigate the performance of iterative reconstruction on the BAO and the broadband, focusing on the iterative implementation based on \\citet{Seo:2010} and \\citet{Schmittfull:2017}. We include redshift-space distortions, halo bias, and shot noise and inspect the components of the reconstructed field in Fourier space and in configuration space using both density field-based reconstruction and displacement field-based reconstruction. We find that the displacement field reconstruction becomes quickly challenging in the presence of non-negligible shot noise and therefore present surrogate methods that can be practically applied to a much more sparse field such as galaxies. For a galaxy field, implementing a debiasing step to remove the Lagrangian bias appears crucial for the displacement field reconstruction. We show that the iterative reconstruction does not substantially improve the BAO feature beyond an optimized standard reconstruction; however, we find that such aggressive optimization of the standard reconstruction with a small smoothing kernel is achieved at the cost of degradation on large scales while taking iterative steps allows us to use a small smoothing kernel `stably', i.e., without causing a substantial deviation from the linear theory model on large scales.",

Since these representations are learned based on reconstructing the input, there is no guarantee that they are robust to pathology-unrelated cues such as speaker identity information. Further, these representations are not necessarily discriminative for pathology detection. In this paper, we exploit supervised auto-encoders to extract robust and discriminative speech representations for Parkinson's disease classification. To reduce the influence of speaker variabilities unrelated to pathology, we propose to obtain speaker identity-invariant representations by adversarial training of an auto-encoder and a speaker identification task. To obtain a discriminative representation, we propose to jointly train an auto-encoder and a pathological speech classifier. Experimental results on a Spanish database show that the proposed supervised representation learning methods yield more robust and discriminative representations for automatically classifying Parkinson's disease speech, outperforming the baseline unsupervised representation learning system.",

The difficulties arise from the complexity of high-dimensional dynamics, sensing and actuation limitations combined with real-time and computational constraints. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) holds the promise to address these issues by fully exploiting the robot dynamics with minimal craftsmanship. In this paper, we propose a novel DRL approach that enables an agent to learn omnidirectional locomotion for humanoid (bipedal) robots. Notably, the locomotion behaviors are accomplished by a single control policy (a single neural network). We achieve this by introducing a new curriculum learning method that gradually increases the task difficulty by scheduling target velocities. In addition, our method does not require reference motions which facilities its application to robots with different kinematics, and reduces the overall complexity. Finally, different strategies for sim-to-real transfer are presented which allow us to transfer the learned policy to a real humanoid robot.",

By simply pulling the different augmented views of each image together or other novel mechanisms, they can learn much unsupervised knowledge and significantly improve the transfer performance of pre-training models. However, these works still cannot avoid the representation collapse problem, i.e., they only focus on limited regions or the extracted features on totally different regions inside each image are nearly the same. Generally, this problem makes the pre-training models cannot sufficiently describe the multi-grained information inside images, which further limits the upper bound of their transfer performance. To alleviate this issue, this paper introduces a simple but effective mechanism, called Exploring the Diversity and Invariance in Yourself E-DIY. By simply pushing the most different regions inside each augmented view away, E-DIY can preserve the diversity of extracted region-level features. By pulling the most similar regions from different augmented views of the same image together, E-DIY can ensure the robustness of region-level features. Benefited from the above diversity and invariance exploring mechanism, E-DIY maximally extracts the multi-grained visual information inside each image. Extensive experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach, e.g., there are 2.1% improvements compared with the strong baseline BYOL on COCO while fine-tuning Mask R-CNN with the R50-C4 backbone and 1X learning schedule.",

        "abstract": "Given the common problem of missing data in real-world applications from various fields, such as remote sensing, ecology and meteorology, the interpolation of missing spatial and spatio-temporal data can be of tremendous value. Existing methods for spatial interpolation, most notably Gaussian processes and spatial autoregressive models, tend to suffer from (a) a trade-off between modelling local or global spatial interaction, (b) the assumption there is only one possible path between two points, and (c) the assumption of homogeneity of intermediate locations between points. Addressing these issues, we propose a value propagation method, inspired by Markov reward processes (MRPs), as a spatial interpolation method, and introduce two variants thereof: (i) a static discount (SD-MRP) and (ii) a data-driven weight prediction (WP-MRP) variant. Both these interpolation variants operate locally, while implicitly accounting for global spatial relationships in the entire system through recursion. We evaluated our proposed methods by comparing the mean absolute errors and running times of interpolated grid cells to those of 7 common baselines. Our analysis involved detailed experiments on two synthetic and two real-world datasets over 44 total experimental conditions. Experimental results show the competitive advantage of MRP interpolation on real-world data, as the average performance of SD-MRP on real-world data under all experimental conditions was ranked significantly higher than that of all other methods, followed by WP-MRP. On synthetic data, we show that WP-MRP can perform better than SD-MRP given sufficiently informative features. We further found that, even in cases where our methods had no significant advantage over baselines numerically, our methods preserved the spatial structure of the target grid better than the baselines.",

        "abstract": "Economic incentives encourage malware authors to constantly develop new, increasingly complex malware to steal sensitive data or blackmail individuals and companies into paying large ransoms. In 2017, the worldwide economic impact of cyberattacks is estimated to be between 445 and 600 billion USD, or 0.8% of global GDP. Traditionally, one of the approaches used to defend against malware is network traffic analysis, which relies on network data to detect the presence of potentially malicious software. However, to keep up with increasing network speeds and amount of traffic, network analysis is generally limited to work on aggregated network data, which is traditionally challenging and yields mixed results. In this paper we present MalPhase, a system that was designed to cope with the limitations of aggregated flows. MalPhase features a multi-phase pipeline for malware detection, type and family classification. The use of an extended set of network flow features and a simultaneous multi-tier architecture facilitates a performance improvement for deep learning models, making them able to detect malicious flows (>98% F1) and categorize them to a respective malware type (>93% F1) and family (>91% F1). Furthermore, the use of robust features and denoising autoencoders allows MalPhase to perform well on samples with varying amounts of benign traffic mixed in. Finally, MalPhase detects unseen malware samples with performance comparable to that of known samples, even when interlaced with benign flows to reflect realistic network environments.",

In machine learning, these have a know-it-when-you-see-it character; e.g., changing the gender of a sentence's subject changes a sentiment predictor's output. To check for spurious correlations, we can `stress test' models by perturbing irrelevant parts of input data and seeing if model predictions change. In this paper, we study stress testing using the tools of causal inference. We introduce \\emph{counterfactual invariance} as a formalization of the requirement that changing irrelevant parts of the input shouldn't change model predictions. We connect counterfactual invariance to out-of-domain model performance, and provide practical schemes for learning (approximately) counterfactual invariant predictors (without access to counterfactual examples). It turns out that both the means and implications of counterfactual invariance depend fundamentally on the true underlying causal structure of the data. Distinct causal structures require distinct regularization schemes to induce counterfactual invariance. Similarly, counterfactual invariance implies different domain shift guarantees depending on the underlying causal structure. This theory is supported by empirical results on text classification.",

Unfortunately, the computation of smallest size $\\delta$-relevant sets is complete for ${NP}^{PP}$, rendering their computation largely infeasible in practice. This paper investigates solutions for tackling the practical limitations of $\\delta$-relevant sets. First, the paper alternatively considers the computation of subset-minimal sets. Second, the paper studies concrete families of classifiers, including decision trees among others. For these cases, the paper shows that the computation of subset-minimal $\\delta$-relevant sets is in NP, and can be solved with a polynomial number of calls to an NP oracle. The experimental evaluation compares the proposed approach with heuristic explainers for the concrete case of the classifiers studied in the paper, and confirms the advantage of the proposed solution over the state of the art.",

While their training is memory-efficient, they are still significantly slower to train than their explicit counterparts. In Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs), the training is performed as a bi-level problem, and its computational complexity is partially driven by the iterative inversion of a huge Jacobian matrix. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to tackle this computational bottleneck from which many bi-level problems suffer. The main idea is to use the quasi-Newton matrices from the forward pass to efficiently approximate the inverse Jacobian matrix in the direction needed for the gradient computation. We provide a theorem that motivates using our method with the original forward algorithms. In addition, by modifying these forward algorithms, we further provide theoretical guarantees that our method asymptotically estimates the true implicit gradient. We empirically study this approach in many settings, ranging from hyperparameter optimization to large Multiscale DEQs applied to CIFAR and ImageNet. We show that it reduces the computational cost of the backward pass by up to two orders of magnitude. All this is achieved while retaining the excellent performance of the original models in hyperparameter optimization and on CIFAR, and giving encouraging and competitive results on ImageNet.",

        "abstract": "Recovering a signal (function) from finitely many binary or Fourier samples is one of the core problems in modern medical imaging, and by now there exist a plethora of methods for recovering a signal from such samples. Examples of methods, which can utilise wavelet reconstruction, include generalised sampling, infinite-dimensional compressive sensing, the parameterised-background data-weak (PBDW) method etc. However, for any of these methods to be applied in practice, accurate and fast modelling of an $N \\times M$ section of the infinite-dimensional change-of-basis matrix between the sampling basis (Fourier or Walsh-Hadamard samples) and the wavelet reconstruction basis is paramount. In this work, we derive an algorithm, which bypasses the $NM$ storage requirement and the $\\mathcal{O}(NM)$ computational cost of matrix-vector multiplication with this matrix when using Walsh-Hadamard samples and wavelet reconstruction. The proposed algorithm computes the matrix-vector multiplication in $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ operations and has a storage requirement of $\\mathcal{O}(2^q)$, where $N=2^{dq} M$, (usually $q \\in \\{1,2\\}$) and $d=1,2$ is the dimension. As matrix-vector multiplications is the computational bottleneck for iterative algorithms used by the mentioned reconstruction methods, the proposed algorithm speeds up the reconstruction of wavelet coefficients from Walsh-Hadamard samples considerably.",

Here, we evaluate various state-of-the-art deep learning models and attention-based frameworks for the classification of images of multiple cervical cells. As we aim to provide interpretable deep learning models to address this task, we also compare their explainability through the visualization of their gradients. We demonstrate the importance of using images that contain multiple cells over using isolated single-cell images. We show the effectiveness of the residual channel attention model for extracting important features from a group of cells, and demonstrate this model's efficiency for this classification task. This work highlights the benefits of channel attention mechanisms in analyzing multiple-cell images for potential relations and distributions within a group of cells.

We study static equilibrium solutions for a self-gravitating fluid in extensions of General Relativity including terms quadratic in the Weyl tensor and in the Ricci scalar. We parametrize the external field in terms of the total mass and the strength of two Yukawa corrections associated with the quadratic terms in the action. Depending on the value of the mass-ratio of the two massive propagating degrees of freedom, these corrections are completely determined by the mass and the radius of the star. At variance with classical General Relativity, measurable definitions of the mass-energy of a star are not uniquely determined by its ADM mass, on the contrary distinct quasi-local definitions should be used to properly characterize the external field. We suggest that this apparent ambiguity can conveniently be exploited to detect deviations from standard General Relativity.",

They allow the individual modelling of each agent's trajectory separately without any complex interaction terms. Our model exploits these simple structures by adding augmented data (position and heading), and adapting their use to the problem of vehicle trajectory prediction in urban scenarios in prediction horizons up to 5 seconds. In addition, a cross-performance analysis is performed between different types of scenarios, including highways, intersections and roundabouts, using recent datasets (inD, rounD, highD and INTERACTION). Our model achieves state-of-the-art results and proves to be flexible and adaptable to different types of urban contexts.",

Furthermore, we show that under sufficient decrease of the confidence levels, the resulting MPC scheme renders the closed-loop system mean-square stable with respect to the true-but-unknown distributions, while remaining less conservative than a fully robust approach. Finally, we show that the data-driven value function converges to its nominal counterpart as the sample size grows to infinity. We illustrate our approach on a numerical example.",

In this paper, we analyze and try to regularize this issue with an independent and identically distributed (IID) sampling perspective and emphasize that holding the IID property for generation in target space (i.e. real data) can naturally avoid mode collapse. This is based on the basic IID assumption for real data in machine learning. However, though the source samples $\\mathbf{z}$ obey IID, the target generation $G(\\mathbf{z})$ may not necessarily be IID. Based on this observation, we provide a new loss to encourage the closeness between the inverse source from generation, and a standard Gaussian distribution in the latent space, as a way of regularizing the generation to be IID. The logic is that the inverse samples back from target data should also be IID for source distribution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show the superiority and robustness of our model.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the role of dimensionality reduction in efficient communication and differential privacy (DP) of the local datasets at the remote users for over-the-air computation (AirComp)-based federated learning (FL) model. More precisely, we consider the FL setting in which clients are prompted to train a machine learning model by simultaneous channel-aware and limited communications with a parameter server (PS) over a Gaussian multiple-access channel (GMAC), so that transmissions sum coherently at the PS globally aware of the channel coefficients. For this setting, an algorithm is proposed based on applying federated stochastic gradient descent (FedSGD) for training the minimum of a given loss function based on the local gradients, Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) random projection for reducing the dimension of the local updates, and artificial noise to further aid user's privacy. For this scheme, our results show that the local DP performance is mainly improved due to injecting noise of greater variance on each dimension while keeping the sensitivity of the projected vectors unchanged. This is while the convergence rate is slowed down compared to the case without dimensionality reduction. As the performance outweighs for the slower convergence, the trade-off between privacy and convergence is higher but is shown to lessen in high-dimensional regime yielding almost the same trade-off with much less communication cost.",

The method involves complementing the target hardware platform, where the physical power data is measured, with another platform on which the CPU performance data, that is needed for model generation, can be collected. The methodology is used to generate accurate fine-grain power models for the the Gaisler GR712RC dual-core LEON3 fault-tolerant SPARC processor with on-board power sensors and no PMU. A Kintex UltraScale FPGA is used as the support platform to obtain the required CPU performance data, by running a soft-core representation of the dual-core LEON3 as on the GR712RC but with a PMU implementation. Both platforms execute the same benchmark set and data collection is synchronised using per-sample timestamps so that the power sensor data from the GR712RC board can be matched to the PMU data from the FPGA. The synchronised samples are then processed by the Robust Energy and Power Predictor Selection (REPPS) software in order to generate power models. The models achieve less than 2% power estimation error when validated on an industrial use-case and can successfully follow program phases, which makes them suitable for runtime power profiling.",

To reduce the quantization errors caused by the large output stride size, two more decoder modules are appended to the end of the simple baseline network to get full output resolution. Then, the global context blocks (GCBs) are added to the encoder and decoder modules to enhance them with global context features. Furthermore, we propose a novel spatial-attention-based multi-scale feature collection and distribution module (SA-MFCD) to fuse and distribute multi-scale features to boost the pose estimation. Experimental results on the MS COCO dataset indicate that our network can remarkably improve the accuracy of human pose estimation over SBN, our network using ResNet34 as the backbone network can even achieve the same accuracy as SBN with ResNet152, and our networks can achieve superior results with big backbone networks.",

However, allocation of virtual PON slices dynamically over such mesh-PON based fronthaul transport is becoming a research challenge. In this paper, we provide a mixed analytical-iterative model to compute optimal virtual PON slice allocation, providing mesh access connectivity with ultra-low end-to-end latency in next-generation MEC-based Cloud-RAN.

We first validate that our training data from conjugate heat transfer simulations of the CFPCR thermal flow problems is noise free and then combine a deterministic surrogate model, based on the mean of a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) simulator, with Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE) to propagate the manufacturing uncertainties in the geometry design variables into the optimisation outputs. The resultant probabilistic model is used to solve a series of robust optimisation problems. The influence of the robust problem formulation and constraints on the design conservatism of the robust optima in comparison with the corresponding deterministic cases is explored briefly.",

The introduction of a lumped-parameter model based on momentum balance entails an easier calibration of the parameter models, that are instead typically numerous in phenomenological-based models. This model is coupled with 3D Navier-Stokes equations describing the blood flow, where the valve surface is represented by a resistive method, and valve leaflets velocity is taken into consideration. The resulting reduced fluid-structure interaction problem has a computational cost that is comparable with the solution of a prescribed-motion fluid dynamics problem. A SUPG-PSPG stabilized finite element scheme is adopted for the discretization of the coupled problem, and the computational results show the suitability of the system in representing the leaflets motion, the blood flow in the ascending aorta, and the pressure jump across the leaflets.",

In this paper, we systematically compare the generalizability of two learning strategies, i.e., transfer learning through the proposed model, ShopperBERT, vs. learning from scratch. ShopperBERT learns nine pretext tasks with 79.2M parameters from 0.8B user behaviors collected over two years to produce user embeddings. As a result, the MLPs that employ our embedding method outperform more complex models trained from scratch for five out of six tasks. Specifically, the pre-trained embeddings have superiority over the task-specific supervised features and the strong baselines, which learn the auxiliary dataset for the cold-start problem. We also show the computational efficiency and embedding visualization of the pre-trained features.",

In this paper, we conduct a systematic in-depth, and comprehensive survey of the applications of DRL techniques in RRAM for next generation wireless networks. Towards this, we first overview the existing traditional RRAM methods and identify their limitations that motivate the use of DRL techniques in RRAM. Then, we provide a comprehensive review of the most widely used DRL algorithms to address RRAM problems, including the value- and policy-based algorithms. The advantages, limitations, and use-cases for each algorithm are provided. We then conduct a comprehensive and in-depth literature review and classify existing related works based on both the radio resources they are addressing and the type of wireless networks they are investigating. To this end, we carefully identify the types of DRL algorithms utilized in each related work, the elements of these algorithms, and the main findings of each related work. Finally, we highlight important open challenges and provide insights into several future research directions in the context of DRL-based RRAM. This survey is intentionally designed to guide and stimulate more research endeavors towards building efficient and fine-grained DRL-based RRAM schemes for future wireless networks.",

We study the large-time asymptotic behavior of the mass inside the ball, and obtain a large-deviation (LD) result as time tends to infinity on the probability that the mass is aytpically small. Then, we consider the problem of BBM among mild Poissonian obstacles, where a random `trap field' in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is created via a Poisson point process. The trap field consists of balls of fixed radius centered at the atoms of the Poisson point process. The mild obstacle rule is that when a particle is inside a trap, it branches at a lower rate, which is allowed to be zero, whereas when outside the trap field it branches at the normal rate. As an application of our LD result on the mass of BBM inside expanding balls, we prove upper bounds on the LD probabilities for the mass of BBM among mild obstacles, which we then use along with the Borel-Cantelli lemma to prove the corresponding strong law of large numbers. Our results are quenched, that is, they hold in almost every environment with respect to the Poisson point process.",

The crux is that, by leveraging generative machine learning, we can generate fresh test inputs that vary in their high-level features (for images, these include object shape, location, texture, and colour). We demonstrate that our approach is capable of detecting deliberately injected faults as well as new faults in state-of-the-art DNNs, and that in both cases, existing methods are unable to find these faults.",

Pseudo-Bayesian inference has been shown to offer a powerful paradign for quantum tomography with attractive theoretical and empirical results.

To overcome this problem, we present an efficient adaptive MCMC sampling method for the Pseudo-Bayesian estimator.

We derive a closed-form lower bound on the work penalty as a function of the time taken for the protocol and bit reset error. It holds for discrete as well as continuous systems, assuming only that the master equation respects detailed balance.",

We base our assumption and the estimate of the wave energy on studies that explored such a process due to the vigorous core convection of massive stars just before they experience a core collapse supernova explosion. Using the stellar evolutionary code MESA we find that the wave energy causes an expansion within few years by tens to hundreds solar radii. Despite the large brightening, we expect the increase in radius and luminosity to substantially enhance mass loss rate and dust formation. The dust shifts the star to become much redder (to the infrared), and the star might actually become fainter in the visible. The overall appearance is of a faint red transient event that lasts for months to few years. We suggest that in some cases envelope expansion might lead stars that are about to leave the RGB to engulf exoplanets. The extended envelope has a smaller binding energy to a degree that allows planets of several Jupiter masses or more and brown dwarfs to survive the common envelope evolution. We suggest this scenario to account for the planet orbiting the white dwarf (WD) WD1856+534 (TIC 267574918) and for the WD - brown dwarf binary system ZTFJ003855.0+203025.5.",

The use of the astronomical signal, whose imprint has been recovered in the geological records, has revolutionized the determination of the geological time scales (e.g. Gradstein & Ogg 2020). However, the orbital variations beyond 60 Myr cannot be reliably predicted because of the chaotic dynamics of the planetary orbits in the Solar System (Laskar 1989). Taking into account this dynamical uncertainty is necessary for a complete astronomical calibration of geological records. Our work addresses this problem with a statistical analysis of 120 000 orbital solutions of the secular model of the Solar System ranging from 500 Myr to 5 Gyr. We obtain the marginal probability density functions of the fundamental secular frequencies using kernel density estimation. The uncertainty of the density estimation is also obtained here in the form of confidence intervals determined by the moving block bootstrap method. The results of the secular model are shown to be in good agreement with those of the direct integrations of a comprehensive model of the Solar System. Application of our work is illustrated on two geological data: the Newark-Hartford records and the Libsack core.",

A critical problem in this task is how to model the dependency both among different frames and inside every frame. However, most of these methods neglect the spatial relationships (inside each frame) and do not make full use of the temporal relationships (among different frames). In this paper, we propose a new transformer-based framework, termed TransVOS, introducing a vision transformer to fully exploit and model both the temporal and spatial relationships. Moreover, most STM-based approaches employ two disparate encoders to extract features of two significant inputs, i.e., reference sets (history frames with predicted masks) and query frame, respectively, increasing the models' parameters and complexity. To slim the popular two-encoder pipeline while keeping the effectiveness, we design a single two-path feature extractor to encode the above two inputs in a unified way. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our TransVOS over state-of-the-art methods on both DAVIS and YouTube-VOS datasets. Codes will be released when it is published.",

Optimizing a long-term metric is challenging because the learning signal (whether the recommendations achieved their desired goals) is delayed and confounded by other user interactions with the system. Immediately measurable proxies such as clicks can lead to suboptimal recommendations due to misalignment with the long-term metric. Many works have applied episodic reinforcement learning (RL) techniques for session-based recommendation but these methods do not account for policy-induced drift in user intent across sessions. We develop a new batch RL algorithm called Short Horizon Policy Improvement (SHPI) that approximates policy-induced distribution shifts across sessions. By varying the horizon hyper-parameter in SHPI, we recover well-known policy improvement schemes in the RL literature. Empirical results on four recommendation tasks show that SHPI can outperform matrix factorization, offline bandits, and offline RL baselines. We also provide a stable and computationally efficient implementation using weighted regression oracles.",

To ensure a content-based model generalize well to a broad range of applications, it is critical to have a training dataset that is large beyond the scale of human labels while achieving desired quality. In this work, we address those two challenges by proposing a novel approach to mine semantically-relevant fresh documents, and their topic labels, with little human supervision. Meanwhile, we design a multitask model called NewsEmbed that alternatively trains a contrastive learning with a multi-label classification to derive a universal document encoder. We show that the proposed approach can provide billions of high quality organic training examples and can be naturally extended to multilingual setting where texts in different languages are encoded in the same semantic space.

Specifically, we consider the problem of quantifying the uncertainty of the hydrodynamic resistance of a roll-on/roll-off passengers ferry advancing in calm water and subject to two operational uncertainties (ship speed and payload). The first four statistical moments (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis), and the probability density function for such quantity of interest (QoI) are computed with two multi-fidelity methods, i.e., the Multi-Index Stochastic Collocation (MISC) method and an adaptive multi-fidelity Stochastic Radial Basis Functions (SRBF) algorithm. The QoI is evaluated via computational fluid dynamics simulations, which are performed with the in-house unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) multi-grid solver $\\chi$navis. The different fidelities employed by both methods are obtained by stopping the RANS solver at different grid levels of the multi-grid cycle. The performance of both methods are presented and discussed: in a nutshell, the findings suggest that, at least for the current implementations of both algorithms, MISC could be preferred whenever a limited computational budget is available, whereas for a larger computational budget SRBFs seem to be preferable, thanks to its robustness to the numerical noise in the evaluations of the QoI.",

However, in real-world applications, we might have only a few labels available from each source domain due to high annotation cost, along with abundant unlabeled data that are much easier to obtain. In this work, we investigate semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG), a more realistic and practical setting. Our proposed approach, StyleMatch, is inspired by FixMatch, a state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning method based on pseudo-labeling, with several new ingredients tailored to solve SSDG. Specifically, 1) to mitigate overfitting in the scarce labeled source data while improving robustness against noisy pseudo labels, we introduce stochastic modeling to the classifier's weights, seen as class prototypes, with Gaussian distributions. 2) To enhance generalization under domain shift, we upgrade FixMatch's two-view consistency learning paradigm based on weak and strong augmentations to a multi-view version with style augmentation as the third complementary view. To provide a comprehensive study and evaluation, we establish two SSDG benchmarks, which cover a wide range of strong baseline methods developed in relevant areas including domain generalization and semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleMatch achieves the best out-of-distribution generalization performance in the low-data regime. We hope our approach and benchmarks can pave the way for future research on data-efficient and generalizable learning systems.",

Recent studies have tackled the problem using ALFRED, a well-designed dataset for the task, but achieved only very low accuracy. This paper proposes a new method, which outperforms the previous methods by a large margin. It is based on a combination of several new ideas. One is a two-stage interpretation of the provided instructions. The method first selects and interprets an instruction without using visual information, yielding a tentative action sequence prediction. It then integrates the prediction with the visual information etc., yielding the final prediction of an action and an object. As the object's class to interact is identified in the first stage, it can accurately select the correct object from the input image. Moreover, our method considers multiple egocentric views of the environment and extracts essential information by applying hierarchical attention conditioned on the current instruction. This contributes to the accurate prediction of actions for navigation. A preliminary version of the method won the ALFRED Challenge 2020. The current version achieves the unseen environment's success rate of 4.45% with a single view, which is further improved to 8.37% with multiple views.",

The two models presented in this paper are a dual-stream, 3D convolutional autoencoder (with residual connections) and a dual-stream, 2D convolutional autoencoder. The publicly available dataset used here contains twelve videos of single home-caged mice alongside frame-level annotations. Under the pretext that the autoencoder only sees normal events, the video data was handcrafted to treat each behaviour as a pseudo-anomaly thereby eliminating them from the others during training. The results are presented for one conspicuous behaviour (hang) and one inconspicuous behaviour (groom). The performance of these models is compared to a single stream autoencoder and a supervised learning model, which are both based on the custom CAE. Both models are also tested on the CUHK Avenue dataset were found to perform as well as some state-of-the-art architectures.",

We propose a new data-driven technique called ClustRank that allows to rank scatterplots according to visible grouping patterns. Our model first encodes scatterplots in the parametric space of a Gaussian Mixture Model, and then uses a classifier trained on human judgment data to estimate the perceptual complexity of grouping patterns. The numbers of initial mixture components and final combined groups determine the rank of the scatterplot. ClustRank improves on existing VQM techniques by mimicking human judgments on two-Gaussian cluster patterns and gives more accuracy when ranking general cluster patterns in scatterplots. We demonstrate its benefit by analyzing kinship data for genome-wide association studies, a domain in which experts rely on the visual analysis of large sets of scatterplots. We make the three benchmark datasets and the ClustRank VQM available for practical use and further improvements.",

Traditionally, new fair algorithmic variants to clustering algorithms are developed for specific notions of fairness. However, depending on the application context, different definitions of fairness might need to be employed. As a result, new algorithms and analysis need to be proposed for each combination of clustering algorithm and fairness definition. Additionally, each new algorithm would need to be reimplemented for deployment in a real-world system. Hence, we propose an alternate approach to fairness in clustering where we augment the original dataset with a small number of data points, called antidote data. When clustering is undertaken on this new dataset, the output is fair, for the chosen clustering algorithm and fairness definition. We formulate this as a general bi-level optimization problem which can accommodate any center-based clustering algorithms and fairness notions. We then categorize approaches for solving this bi-level optimization for different problem settings. Extensive experiments on different clustering algorithms and fairness notions show that our algorithms can achieve desired levels of fairness on many real-world datasets with a very small percentage of antidote data added. We also find that our algorithms achieve lower fairness costs and competitive clustering performance compared to other state-of-the-art fair clustering algorithms.",

The large and closely correlated dependence on stimulus level of the BM velocity and fluid pressure gain (Dong and Olson, 2013), is consistent with a physiologically-oriented schematization of the outer hair cell (OHC) mechanism if two hydrodynamic effects are accounted for: amplification of the differential pressure associated with a focusing phenomenon, and viscous damping at the BM-fluid interface. The predictions of the analytical 2-D WKB approach are compared to solutions of a 3-D finite element model, showing that these hydrodynamic phenomena yield stable high-gain response in the peak region and a smooth transition among models with different effectiveness of the active mechanism, mimicking the cochlear nonlinear response over a wide stimulus level range. This study explains how an effectively anti-damping nonlinear OHC force may yield large BM and pressure dynamical ranges along with an almost level-independent admittance.",

Among other effects, one of the consequences of harbouring such fields is the deformation of the neutron star structure, leading, together with rotation, to the emission of continuous gravitational waves. On the one hand, the details of their internal magnetic fields are mostly unknown. Likewise, their internal structure, encoded by the equation of state, is highly uncertain. Here we present a study of axisymmetric models of isolated magnetised neutron stars, for various realistic equations of state considered viable by observations and nuclear physics constraints. We show that it is possible to find simple relations between the magnetic deformation of a neutron star, its Komar mass and its circumferential radius. Such relations are quasi-universal, meaning that they are mostly independent on the equation of state of the neutron star and only slightly dependent on the magnetic field configuration. Being formulated in terms of potentially observable quantities, as we discuss, our results could help to constrain the magnetic properties of the neutron star interior and to better assess the detectability of continuous gravitational waves by isolated neutron stars, without knowing their equation of state. Our results are derived both in general relativity and in scalar-tensor theories - one of the most promising extensions of general relativity - in this case by considering also the scalar charge. We show that even in this case general relations hold that account for deviations from general relativity, that could potentially be used to set constraints on the gravitational theory.",

        "abstract": "Recent semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods are commonly based on pseudo labeling. Since the SSL performance is greatly influenced by the quality of pseudo labels, mutual learning has been proposed to effectively suppress the noises in the pseudo supervision. In this work, we propose robust mutual learning that improves the prior approach in two aspects. First, the vanilla mutual learners suffer from the coupling issue that models may converge to learn homogeneous knowledge. We resolve this issue by introducing mean teachers to generate mutual supervisions so that there is no direct interaction between the two students. We also show that strong data augmentations, model noises and heterogeneous network architectures are essential to alleviate the model coupling. Second, we notice that mutual learning fails to leverage the network's own ability for pseudo label refinement. Therefore, we introduce self-rectification that leverages the internal knowledge and explicitly rectifies the pseudo labels before the mutual teaching. Such self-rectification and mutual teaching collaboratively improve the pseudo label accuracy throughout the learning. The proposed robust mutual learning demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation in low-data regime.",

        "abstract": "EEG is the gold standard for seizure detection in the newborn infant, but EEG interpretation in the preterm group is particularly challenging; trained experts are scarce and the task of interpreting EEG in real-time is arduous. Preterm infants are reported to have a higher incidence of seizures compared to term infants. Preterm EEG morphology differs from that of term infants, which implies that seizure detection algorithms trained on term EEG may not be appropriate. The task of developing preterm specific algorithms becomes extra-challenging given the limited amount of annotated preterm EEG data available. This paper explores novel deep learning (DL) architectures for the task of neonatal seizure detection in preterm infants. The study tests and compares several approaches to address the problem: training on data from full-term infants; training on data from preterm infants; training on age-specific preterm data and transfer learning. The system performance is assessed on a large database of continuous EEG recordings of 575h in duration. It is shown that the accuracy of a validated term-trained EEG seizure detection algorithm, based on a support vector machine classifier, when tested on preterm infants falls well short of the performance achieved for full-term infants. An AUC of 88.3% was obtained when tested on preterm EEG as compared to 96.6% obtained when tested on term EEG. When re-trained on preterm EEG, the performance marginally increases to 89.7%. An alternative DL approach shows a more stable trend when tested on the preterm cohort, starting with an AUC of 93.3% for the term-trained algorithm and reaching 95.0% by transfer learning from the term model using available preterm data.",

Besides, we refine the design of quantizer by optimized quantization thresholds, which are obtained resorting to the popular particle swarm optimization algorithmthe (PSOA). The simulation is conducted to demonstrate the performance variations of detectors based on unquantized and quantized data.

Electroencephalography (EEG) has been considered as one of the best physiological signals to detect drivers drowsy states, since it directly measures neurophysiological activities in the brain. However, designing a calibration-free system for driver drowsiness detection with EEG is still a challenging task, as EEG suffers from serious mental and physical drifts across different subjects. In this paper, we propose a compact and interpretable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to discover shared EEG features across different subjects for driver drowsiness detection. We incorporate the Global Average Pooling (GAP) layer in the model structure, allowing the Class Activation Map (CAM) method to be used for localizing regions of the input signal that contribute most for classification. Results show that the proposed model can achieve an average accuracy of 73.22% on 11 subjects for 2-class cross-subject EEG signal classification, which is higher than conventional machine learning methods and other state-of-art deep learning methods. It is revealed by the visualization technique that the model has learned biologically explainable features, e.g., Alpha spindles and Theta burst, as evidence for the drowsy state. It is also interesting to see that the model uses artifacts that usually dominate the wakeful EEG, e.g., muscle artifacts and sensor drifts, to recognize the alert state. The proposed model illustrates a potential direction to use CNN models as a powerful tool to discover shared features related to different mental states across different subjects from EEG signals.",

Ability to analyze this data offers new opportunities for real-time health monitoring and forecasting.

Most methods proposed for time series analysis and classification do not handle datasets with these characteristics nor do they offer interpretability and explainability, a critical requirement in the health domain. We propose an unsupervised method for learning representations of time series based on common patterns identified within them. The patterns are, interpretable, variable in length, and extracted using Byte Pair Encoding compression technique. In this way the method can capture both long-term and short-term dependencies present in the data. We show that this method applies to both univariate and multivariate time series and beats state-of-the-art approaches on a real world dataset collected from wearable sensors.",

        "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) based on mobile sensors plays an important role in ubiquitous computing. However, the rise of data regulatory constraints precludes collecting private and labeled signal data from personal devices at scale. Federated learning has emerged as a decentralized alternative solution to model training, which iteratively aggregates locally updated models into a shared global model, therefore being able to leverage decentralized, private data without central collection. However, the effectiveness of federated learning for HAR is affected by the fact that each user has different activity types and even a different signal distribution for the same activity type. Furthermore, it is uncertain if a single global model trained can generalize well to individual users or new users with heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose Meta-HAR, a federated representation learning framework, in which a signal embedding network is meta-learned in a federated manner, while the learned signal representations are further fed into a personalized classification network at each user for activity prediction. In order to boost the representation ability of the embedding network, we treat the HAR problem at each user as a different task and train the shared embedding network through a Model-Agnostic Meta-learning framework, such that the embedding network can generalize to any individual user. Personalization is further achieved on top of the robustly learned representations in an adaptation procedure. We conducted extensive experiments based on two publicly available HAR datasets as well as a newly created HAR dataset. Results verify that Meta-HAR is effective at maintaining high test accuracies for individual users, including new users, and significantly outperforms several baselines, including Federated Averaging, Reptile and even centralized learning in certain cases.",

The upper level sets of the depth, termed the trimmed regions of a measure, serve as a natural generalization of the quantiles and inter-quantile regions to higher-dimensional spaces. The smallest non-empty trimmed region, coined the halfspace median of a measure, generalizes the median. We focus on the (inverse) ray basis theorem for the halfspace depth, a crucial theoretical result that characterizes the halfspace median by a covering property. First, a novel elementary proof of that statement is provided, under minimal assumptions on the underlying measure. The proof applies not only to the median, but also to other trimmed regions. Motivated by the technical development of the amended ray basis theorem, we specify connections between the trimmed regions, floating bodies, and additional equi-affine convex sets related to the depth. As a consequence, minimal conditions for the strict monotonicity of the depth are obtained. Applications to the computation of the depth and robust estimation are outlined.",

First, we consider the closely related model of all-pay auctions with favoritism and completely characterize its equilibrium. Based on this result, we prove the existence of a set of optimal univariate distributions -- which serve as candidate marginals for an equilibrium -- of the Colonel Blotto game with favoritism and show an explicit construction thereof. In several particular cases, this directly leads to an equilibrium of the Colonel Blotto game with favoritism.

        "abstract": "Online information has increased tremendously in today's age of Internet. As a result, the need has arose to extract relevant content from the plethora of available information. Researchers are widely using automatic text summarization techniques for extracting useful and relevant information from voluminous available information, it also enables users to obtain valuable knowledge in a limited period of time with minimal effort. The summary obtained from the automatic text summarization often faces the issues of diversity and information coverage. Promising results are obtained for automatic text summarization by the introduction of new techniques based on graph ranking of sentences, clustering, and optimization. This research work proposes CoRank, a two-stage sentence selection model involving clustering and then ranking of sentences. The initial stage involves clustering of sentences using a novel clustering algorithm, and later selection of salient sentences using CoRank algorithm. The approach aims to cover two objectives: maximum coverage and diversity, which is achieved by the extraction of main topics and sub-topics from the original text. The performance of the CoRank is validated on DUC2001 and DUC 2002 data sets.",

When operated in forward bias as light emitting diode, the devices emit light centered at 1550 nm.

The recently predicted spin-helical regime in graphene on transition metal dichalcogenides, in which spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom are locked together [M. Offidani et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 196801 (2017)], suggests their potential application in spintronics. Here, by deriving an Eilenberger equation for the quasiclassical Green's function of two-dimensional Dirac fermions in the presence of} spin-orbit coupling\\textcolor{black}{{} (SOC) and scalar disorder, we obtain analytical expressions for the dc spin galvanic susceptibility and spin Hall conductivity in the spin-helical regime. Our results disclose a sign change in the spin Hall angle (SHA) when the Fermi energy relative to the Dirac point matches the Bychkov-Rashba energy scale, irrespective of the magnitude of the spin-valley interaction imprinted on the graphene layer. The behavior of the SHA is connected to a reversal of the total internal angular momentum of Bloch electrons that reflects the spin-pseudospin entanglement induced by SOC. We also show that the charge-spin conversion reaches a maximum when the Fermi level lies at the edge of the spin-minority band in agreement with previous findings. Both features are fingerprints of spin-helical Dirac fermions and suggest a direct way to estimate the strength of proximity-induced SOC from transport data. The relevance of these findings for interpreting recent spin-charge conversion measurements in nonlocal spin-valve geometry is also discussed.",

EFM includes the surveillance of the fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns in conjunction with the maternal uterine contractions providing a wealth of data about fetal behavior and the threat of diminished oxygenation and perfusion. Adverse outcomes universally associate a fetal injury with the failure to timely respond to FHR pattern information. Historically, the EFM data, stored digitally, are available only as rasterized pdf images for contemporary or historical discussion and examination. In reality, however, they are rarely reviewed systematically. Using a unique archive of EFM collected over 50 years of practice in conjunction with adverse outcomes, we present a deep learning framework for training and detection of incipient or past fetal injury. We report 94% accuracy in identifying early, preventable fetal injury intrapartum. This framework is suited for automating an early warning and decision support system for maintaining fetal well-being during the stresses of labor. Ultimately, such a system could enable a physician to timely respond during labor and prevent adverse outcomes. When adverse outcomes cannot be avoided, they can provide guidance to the early neuroprotective treatment of the newborn.",

The quality and diversity of synthesized data are highly dependent on the annotated data used to train the models, which not rarely struggle to derive very different yet realistic samples from the training ones. That adds an inherent bias to lesion segmentation algorithms and limits synthesizing lesion evolution scenarios efficiently. This paper presents a method for decoupling shape and density for liver lesion synthesis, creating a framework that allows straight-forwardly driving the synthesis. We offer qualitative results that show the synthesis control by modifying shape and density individually, and quantitative results that demonstrate that embedding the density information in the generator model helps to increase lesion segmentation performance compared to using the shape solely.",

        "abstract": "Hazard event sets, which correspond to a collection of synthetic flood events, are an important tool for practitioners to analyse and manage future flood risks. In this paper, we address the issue of generating hazard event sets for northern England and southern Scotland, a region which has been particularly affected by flooding over the past years. We start by analysing extreme river flow across 45 gauges in the region using recently introduced ideas from extreme value theory. This results in a set of extremal principal components, with the first components describing the large-scale structure of the observed flood events, and we find interesting connections to the region's topography and climate. We then introduce a framework to approximate the distribution of the extremal principal components which is dimension reducing in that it distinctly handles the large-scale and local extremal behavior. Synthetic flood events are subsequently generated efficiently by sampling from the fitted distribution. Our approach for generating hazard event sets can be easily implemented by practitioners and our results indicate good agreement between the observed and simulated extreme river flow dynamics.",

Inspired by analogous notions in theory of compact Lie groups, we introduce the concepts of a maximal torus and a Weyl group for actions of profinite groups on rooted trees, and we show that the Weyl group contains important information about settled elements.

Distinct flow behaviors are found in retinal arteries and veins with seemingly interrelated waveforms. We demonstrate a full field mapping of the local resistivity index, and the possibility to perform unambiguous identification of retinal arteries and veins on the basis of their systolodiastolic variations. Finally we investigate the arterial flow waveforms in the retina and choroid and find synchronous and similar waveforms, although with a lower pulsatility in choroidal vessels.

Further, this interaction is not immutable in time but rather unfolds in a succession of patterns, thereby allowing the brain to adapt to constantly changing exterior and interior milieus. This calls for a framework able to study patterned spatiotemporal interactions between components of the brain. A theoretical and methodological framework is developed to study the brain's coordination dynamics. Here we present a toolset designed to decipher the continuous dynamics of electrophysiological data and its relation to (dys-) function. Understanding the spatiotemporal organization of brain patterns and their association with behavioral, cognitive and clinically-relevant variables is an important challenge for the fields of neuroscience and biologically-inspired engineering. It is hoped that such a comprehensive framework will shed light not only on human behavior and the human mind but also help in understanding the growing number of pathologies that are linked to disorders of brain connectivity.",

Furthermore, we adapt different pre-training methods to investigate their impacts on the proposed model. We apply our approach to Bone Age Prediction and Lesion Localization. In most cases, the proposed model shows better performance compared to common architectures. More importantly, our model expresses systematically higher confidence in more accurate predictions and less confidence in less accurate ones.

We investigate the use of statistical descriptors of simple time-frequency features for acoustic signals and binary features for the presence of symptoms. Unlike previous works, we primarily focus on the application of simple linear classifiers like logistic regression and support vector machines for acoustic data while decision tree models are employed on the symptoms data. We show that a multi-modal integration of acoustics and symptoms classifiers achieves an area-under-curve (AUC) of 92.40, a significant improvement over any individual modality. Several ablation experiments are also provided which highlight the acoustic and symptom dimensions that are important for the task of COVID-19 diagnostics.",

These transfer matrices are no longer Hermitian and differ from the ones guaranteeing local conservation laws, but remain mutually commuting at different values of the spectral parameter defining the circuit. Exact eigenstates can still be constructed as a Bethe ansatz, but while these transfer matrices are diagonalizable in the inhomogeneous case, the homogeneous limit corresponds to an exceptional point where multiple eigenstates coalesce and Jordan blocks appear. Remarkably, the complete set of (generalized) eigenstates is only obtained when taking into account a combinatorial number of nontrivial vacuum states. In all cases, the Bethe equations reduce to those of the integrable spin-1 chain and exhibit a global SU(2) symmetry, significantly reducing the total number of eigenstates required in the calculation of correlation functions. A similar construction is shown to hold for the calculation of out-of-time-order correlations.",

The edge resonance is weakened by the material perturbation and the complete mode conversion is illustrated with incident $S_0$ mode. The Fano resonance occurs on the reflected $A_0$ mode as a result of interference between the resonance and direct scattering with incident $A_0$ mode. A hybrid analytical model based on the collocation discretization and the modal decomposition of the elastic field is developed to analyze the scattering properties of the semi-infinite plates. The Fano line-shape is discussed in detail. The results show that the Fano line shape is sensitive to the volume fraction, which is beneficial for the quantitative guided wave application.",

However, hyperspectral images are highly data-dense and often benefit from methods to reduce the number of spectral bands while retaining the most useful information for a specific application. We propose a novel band selection method to select a reduced set of wavelengths, obtained from an HSI system in the context of image classification. Our approach consists of two main steps: the first utilizes a filter-based approach to find relevant spectral bands based on a collinearity analysis between a band and its neighbors. This analysis helps to remove redundant bands and dramatically reduces the search space. The second step applies a wrapper-based approach to select bands from the reduced set based on their information entropy values, and trains a compact Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to evaluate the performance of the current selection. We present classification results obtained from our method and compare them to other feature selection methods on two hyperspectral image datasets. Additionally, we use the original hyperspectral data cube to simulate the process of using actual filters in a multispectral imager. We show that our method produces more suitable results for a multispectral sensor design.",

Media and public attention towards NFTs has exploded in 2021, when the NFT art market has experienced record sales while celebrated new star artists. However, little is known about the overall structure and evolution of the NFT market. Here, we analyse data concerning 6.1 million trades of 4.7 million NFTs generating a total trading volume of 935 millions US dollars. Our data are obtained primarily from the Ethereum and WAX blockchains and cover the period between June 23, 2017 and April 27, 2021. First, we characterize the statistical properties of the market. Second, we build the network of interactions and show that traders have bursts of activity followed by inactive periods, and typically specialize on NFTs associated to similar objects. Third, we cluster objects associated to NFTs according to their visual features and show that NFTs within the same category tend to be visually homogeneous. Finally, we investigate the predictability of NFT sales. We use simple machine learning algorithms and find that prices can be best predicted by the sale history of the NFT collection, but also by some features describing the properties of the associated object (e.g., visual features of digital images). We anticipate that our analysis will be of interest to both researchers and practitioners and will spark further research on the NFT production, adoption and trading in different contexts.",

We focus on the near-horizon geometry of the near-extremal black hole, where the effective theory reduces to Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity coupled to a massive scalar field. We compute the corrections to correlation functions due to cubic interactions present in this theory. A novel feature is that these corrections do not have a definite sign: for AdS$_5$ black holes the sign depends on the mass of the extremal solution. We discuss possible interpretations of these corrections from a gravitational and holographic perspective. We also quantify the imprint of the JT sector on the UV region, i.e. how these degrees of freedom, characteristic for the near-horizon region, influence the asymptotically far region of the black hole. This gives an interesting insight on how to interpret the IR modes in the context of their UV completion, which depends on the environment that contains the black hole.",

It implies that the variabilities of CL AGNs cannot be reproduced by varying the mass accretion rate of the thin disk. In this work, we employ a magnetic accretion disk-outflow model to calculate the inflow time of the disk predominantly driven by magnetic outflows. In this model, most angular momentum of the gas in the disk is carried away by the outflows, and therefore its radial velocity can be substantially higher than that of a conventional viscous disk. Our calculations show that the inflow time of such a disk with outflows can be around several years to tens years. The calculated spectra of the disk with outflows can fit the observed spectra of a CL AGN Mrk 1018 quite well both in the low and high states. The derived inflow time of such a disk with outflows is around 5 years in the high state, while it becomes $\\sim 20$ years in the low state, which is roughly consistent with the observations of the variabilities in Mrk 1018.",

Here, we argue that the leading finite-width corrections to the average feature kernels for any Bayesian network with linear readout and quadratic cost have a largely universal form. We illustrate this explicitly for two classes of fully connected networks: deep linear networks and networks with a single nonlinear hidden layer.

Body Composition is recognized as an important driver and risk factor for a wide variety of diseases, as well as a predictor of individual patient-specific clinical outcomes to treatment choices or surgical interventions. 3D CT images are routinely acquired in the oncological worklows and deliver accurate rendering of internal anatomy and therefore can be used opportunistically to assess the amount of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue compartments. Powerful tools of artificial intelligence such as deep learning are making it feasible now to segment the entire 3D image and generate accurate measurements of all internal anatomy. These will enable the overcoming of the severe bottleneck that existed previously, namely, the need for manual segmentation, which was prohibitive to scale to the hundreds of 2D axial slices that made up a 3D volumetric image. Automated tools such as presented here will now enable harvesting whole-body measurements from 3D CT or MRI images, leading to a new era of discovery of the drivers of various diseases based on individual tissue, organ volume, shape, and functional status. These measurements were hitherto unavailable thereby limiting the field to a very small and limited subset. These discoveries and the potential to perform individual image segmentation with high speed and accuracy are likely to lead to the incorporation of these 3D measures into individual specific treatment planning models related to nutrition, aging, chemotoxicity, surgery and survival after the onset of a major disease such as cancer.",

        "abstract": "Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry takes advantage of the quantum nature of two-photon interference to increase the resolution of precision measurements of time-delays. Relying on few-photon probe states, this approach is applicable also in cases of extremely sensible samples and it achieves attosecond (nanometer path length) scale resolution, which is relevant to cell biology and two-dimensional materials. Here, we theoretically analyze how the precision of Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometers can be significantly improved by engineering the spectral distribution of two-photon probe states. In particular, we assess the metrological power of different classes of biphoton states with non-Gaussian time-frequency spectral distributions, considering the estimation of both time- and frequency-shifts. We find that grid states, characterized by a periodic structure of peaks in the chronocyclic Wigner function, can outperform standard biphoton states in sensing applications. The considered states can be feasibly produced with atomic photon sources, bulk non-linear crystals and integrated photonic waveguide devices.",

        "abstract": "Recent research has shown the potential of using available mobile fog devices (such as smartphones, drones, domestic and industrial robots) as relays to minimize communication outages between sensors and destination devices, where localized Internet-of-Things services (e.g., manufacturing process control, health and security monitoring) are delivered. However, these mobile relays deplete energy when they move and transmit to distant destinations. As such, power-control mechanisms and intelligent mobility of the relay devices are critical in improving communication performance and energy utilization. In this paper, we propose a Q-learning-based decentralized approach where each mobile fog relay agent (MFRA) is controlled by an autonomous agent which uses reinforcement learning to simultaneously improve communication performance and energy utilization. Each autonomous agent learns based on the feedback from the destination and its own energy levels whether to remain active and forward the message, or become passive for that transmission phase. We evaluate the approach by comparing with the centralized approach, and observe that with lesser number of MFRAs, our approach is able to ensure reliable delivery of data and reduce overall energy cost by 56.76\\% -- 88.03\\%.",

        "abstract": "In decentralised autonomous systems it is the interactions between individual agents which govern the collective behaviours of the system. These local-level interactions are themselves often governed by an underlying network structure. These networks are particularly important for collective learning and decision-making whereby agents must gather evidence from their environment and propagate this information to other agents in the system. Models for collective behaviours may often rely upon the assumption of total connectivity between agents to provide effective information sharing within the system, but this assumption may be ill-advised. In this paper we investigate the impact that the underlying network has on performance in the context of collective learning. Through simulations we study small-world networks with varying levels of connectivity and randomness and conclude that totally-connected networks result in higher average error when compared to networks with less connectivity. Furthermore, we show that networks of high regularity outperform networks with increasing levels of random connectivity.",

Beside the necessity of pointwise reachablility these conditions put restrictions on the spectra of the matrices $A(\\theta)$ and the Hermite indices of the pair $(A(\\theta),B(\\theta))$.

Recently, inpainting started being used for watermark removal, raising concerns. In this paper we study how to manipulate it using our markpainting technique. First, we show how an image owner with access to an inpainting model can augment their image in such a way that any attempt to edit it using that model will add arbitrary visible information. We find that we can target multiple different models simultaneously with our technique. This can be designed to reconstitute a watermark if the editor had been trying to remove it. Second, we show that our markpainting technique is transferable to models that have different architectures or were trained on different datasets, so watermarks created using it are difficult for adversaries to remove. Markpainting is novel and can be used as a manipulation alarm that becomes visible in the event of inpainting.",

However, not all goals can be captured in this manner. Specifically, it is easy to see that Convex MDPs in which goals are expressed as convex functions of stationary distributions cannot, in general, be formulated in this manner. In this paper, we reformulate the convex MDP problem as a min-max game between the policy and cost (negative reward) players using Fenchel duality and propose a meta-algorithm for solving it. We show that the average of the policies produced by an RL agent that maximizes the non-stationary reward produced by the cost player converges to an optimal solution to the convex MDP. Finally, we show that the meta-algorithm unifies several disparate branches of reinforcement learning algorithms in the literature, such as apprenticeship learning, variational intrinsic control, constrained MDPs, and pure exploration into a single framework.",

Unlike other approaches that use either IC3 or an SMT solver as a black box, Quic3 carefully manages quantified generalization (to construct quantified invariants) and quantifier instantiation (to detect convergence in the presence of quantifiers). While Quic3 is not guaranteed to converge, it is guaranteed to make progress by exploring longer and longer executions.

        "abstract": "In the past decade, there has been much discussion about the issue of biased reporting in clinical research. Despite this attention, there have been limited tools developed for the systematic assessment of qualitative statements made in clinical research, with most studies assessing qualitative statements relying on the use of manual expert raters, which limits their size. Also, previous attempts to develop larger scale tools, such as those using natural language processing, were limited by both their accuracy and the number of categories used for the classification of their findings. With these limitations in mind, this study's goal was to develop a classification algorithm that was both suitably accurate and finely grained to be applied on a large scale for assessing the qualitative sentiment expressed in clinical trial abstracts. Additionally, this study seeks to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm, GAN-BioBERT, to previous studies as well as to expert manual rating of clinical trial abstracts. This study develops a three-class sentiment classification algorithm for clinical trial abstracts using a semi-supervised natural language process model based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) model, from a series of clinical trial abstracts annotated by a group of experts in academic medicine. Results: The use of this algorithm was found to have a classification accuracy of 91.3%, with a macro F1-Score of 0.92, which is a significant improvement in accuracy when compared to previous methods and expert ratings, while also making the sentiment classification finer grained than previous studies. The proposed algorithm, GAN-BioBERT, is a suitable classification model for the large-scale assessment of qualitative statements in clinical trial literature, providing an accurate, reproducible tool for the large-scale study of clinical publication trends.",

TF representation allows us to identify signal components or features in a mixed time and frequency plane. There are several well-known tools, such as Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and various other variants for such a purpose. The main requirement for a TF representation tool is to give a high-resolution view of the signal such that the signal components or features are identifiable. A commonly used method is the reassignment process which reduces the cross-terms by artificially moving smoothed WVD values from their actual location to the center of the gravity for that region. In this article, we propose a novel reassignment method using the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN). We train a CGAN to perform the reassignment process. Through examples, it is shown that the method generates high-resolution TF representations which are better than the current reassignment methods.",

We propose Diverse Successive Policies, a method for discovering policies that are diverse in the space of Successor Features, while assuring that they are near optimal. We formalize the problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) where the goal is to find policies that maximize diversity, characterized by an intrinsic diversity reward, while remaining near-optimal with respect to the extrinsic reward of the MDP. We also analyze how recently proposed robustness and discrimination rewards perform and find that they are sensitive to the initialization of the procedure and may converge to sub-optimal solutions. To alleviate this, we propose new explicit diversity rewards that aim to minimize the correlation between the Successor Features of the policies in the set. We compare the different diversity mechanisms in the DeepMind Control Suite and find that the type of explicit diversity we are proposing is important to discover distinct behavior, like for example different locomotion patterns.",

The particle is subject to stochastic resetting, meaning that at random times it is forced to return to the starting point. Here we consider a return mechanism governed by a deterministic law of motion, so that the time cost required to return is correlated to the position occupied at the time of the reset. We show that in such conditions the process reaches a stationary state which, for some kinds of deterministic return dynamics, is independent of the return phase. Furthermore, we investigate the first-passage properties of the system and provide explicit formulas for the mean first-hitting time. Our findings are supported by numerical simulations.",

However, zero-shot generalization to new settings is not always possible. When the robot encounters a new environment or object, it may need to finetune some of its previously learned skills to accommodate this change. But crucially, previously learned behaviors and models should still be suitable to accelerate this relearning. In this paper, we aim to study how generative models of possible outcomes can allow a robot to learn visual representations of affordances, so that the robot can sample potentially possible outcomes in new situations, and then further train its policy to achieve those outcomes. In effect, prior data is used to learn what kinds of outcomes may be possible, such that when the robot encounters an unfamiliar setting, it can sample potential outcomes from its model, attempt to reach them, and thereby update both its skills and its outcome model. This approach, visuomotor affordance learning (VAL), can be used to train goal-conditioned policies that operate on raw image inputs, and can rapidly learn to manipulate new objects via our proposed affordance-directed exploration scheme. We show that VAL can utilize prior data to solve real-world tasks such drawer opening, grasping, and placing objects in new scenes with only five minutes of online experience in the new scene.",

Over the years, several variations of its components were proposed to enhance the performance of the learned policies as well as the sample complexity of the algorithm. In practice, these choices are rarely tested all together in rigorous empirical studies. It is therefore difficult to discuss and understand what choices, among the high-level algorithmic options as well as low-level implementation details, matter. To tackle this issue, we implement more than 50 of these choices in a generic adversarial imitation learning framework and investigate their impacts in a large-scale study (>500k trained agents) with both synthetic and human-generated demonstrations. While many of our findings confirm common practices, some of them are surprising or even contradict prior work. In particular, our results suggest that artificial demonstrations are not a good proxy for human data and that the very common practice of evaluating imitation algorithms only with synthetic demonstrations may lead to algorithms which perform poorly in the more realistic scenarios with human demonstrations.",

This is mainly due to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are capable of learning rich feature extractors from large datasets. However, most deep learning classification methods are trained on clean images and are not robust when handling noisy ones, even if a restoration preprocessing step is applied. While novel methods address this problem, they rely on modified feature extractors and thus necessitate retraining. We instead propose a method that can be applied on a pretrained classifier. Our method exploits a fidelity map estimate that is fused into the internal representations of the feature extractor, thereby guiding the attention of the network and making it more robust to noisy data. We improve the noisy-image classification (NIC) results by significantly large margins, especially at high noise levels, and come close to the fully retrained approaches. Furthermore, as proof of concept, we show that when using our oracle fidelity map we even outperform the fully retrained methods, whether trained on noisy or restored images.",

The lack of a mass gap indicated the possible existence of a self-similar critical solution as in general relativity. Here we provide further evidence for its existence. Using an adaptive mesh refinement code, we show that \"echoes\" arise as a result of the discrete self-similarity in space-time. We also show the existence of \"wiggles\" in the mass scaling relation, as in the classical theory. The results from the semi-classical theory agree well with those of classical general relativity unless one takes unrealistically large values for the polymerization parameter.",

While the lowest energy states of these artificial atoms serve as the qubit basis, the higher levels are responsible for both a host of attractive gate schemes as well as generating undesired interactions. In particular, when coupling these atoms to generate entanglement, the higher levels cause shifts in the computational levels that leads to unwanted $ZZ$ quantum crosstalk. Here, we present a novel technique to manipulate the energy levels and mitigate this crosstalk via a simultaneous AC Stark effect on coupled qubits. This breaks a fundamental deadlock between qubit-qubit coupling and crosstalk, leading to a 90ns CNOT with a gate error of (0.19 $\\pm$ 0.02) $\\%$ and the demonstration of a novel CZ gate with fixed-coupling single-junction transmon qubits. Furthermore, we show a definitive improvement in circuit performance with crosstalk cancellation over seven qubits, demonstrating the scalability of the technique.

Recent work has demonstrated how supervised learning can be leveraged to learn better and more compact 3D features. However, those approaches' reliance on ground-truth annotation limits their scalability. We propose BYOC: a self-supervised approach that learns visual and geometric features from RGB-D video without relying on ground-truth pose or correspondence. Our key observation is that randomly-initialized CNNs readily provide us with good correspondences; allowing us to bootstrap the learning of both visual and geometric features. Our approach combines classic ideas from point cloud registration with more recent representation learning approaches. We evaluate our approach on indoor scene datasets and find that our method outperforms traditional and learned descriptors, while being competitive with current state-of-the-art supervised approaches.",

We aim to identify the mechanisms responsible for the particle acceleration and the magnetic field amplification in diffuse radio sources of the galaxy cluster ClG 0217+70. We observed the cluster with LOFAR at 141 MHz and VLA at 1.5 GHz, and combine with VLA 1.4 GHz archival data to study the morphological, spectral properties of the sources in the cluster. We add Chandra archival data to examine the thermal and non-thermal relation of the gas in the cluster centre. Our LOFAR and VLA new data confirm the presence of a giant radio halo in the cluster centre and multiple relics in the outskirts. The radio and X-ray emission from the halo are positively correlated, implying a tight relation between the thermal and non-thermal components. The SE radio structure with a projected size of 3.5 Mpc is the most extended radio relic detected to date. The spectral index across the width of the relics steepens towards the cluster centre, suggesting the energy ageing in the post-shock regions. The shock Mach numbers for the relics derived from the spectral index map reasonably range between 2.0 and 3.2. However, the integrated spectral indices lead to increasingly high Mach numbers for the relics farther from the cluster centre. This discrepancy could be because the relation between injection and integrated spectra does not hold for distant shocks, suggesting that the cooling time for the radio-emitting electrons is shorter than the crossing time of the shocks. The variations in the surface brightness of the relics and the low Mach numbers imply that the radio-emitting electrons are re-accelerated from fossil gas that is originally energised by active galactic nucleus activities.",

To shed light on this problem, we develop an approach based on multispectral deep-ultraviolet (UV) microscopy that provides novel quantitative insight into the aggressiveness and grade of this disease. First, we find that UV spectral signatures from endogenous molecules give rise to a phenotypical continuum that differentiates critical structures of thin tissue sections with subcellular spatial resolution, including nuclei, cytoplasm, stroma, basal cells, nerves, and inflammation. Further, we show that this phenotypical continuum can be applied as a surrogate biomarker of prostate cancer malignancy, where patients with the most aggressive tumors show a ubiquitous glandular phenotypical shift. Lastly, we adapt a two-part Cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Network to translate the label-free deep-UV images into virtual hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained images. Agreement between the virtual H&E images and the gold standard H&E-stained tissue sections is evaluated by a panel of pathologists who find that the two modalities are in excellent agreement. This work has significant implications towards improving our ability to objectively quantify prostate cancer grade and aggressiveness, thus improving the management and clinical outcomes of prostate cancer patients. This same approach can also be applied broadly in other tumor types to achieve low-cost, stain-free, quantitative histopathological analysis.",

        "abstract": "Simulated images of a black hole surrounded by optically thin emission typically display two main features: a central brightness depression and a narrow, bright \"photon ring\" consisting of strongly lensed images superposed on top of the direct emission. The photon ring closely tracks a theoretical curve on the image plane corresponding to light rays that asymptote to unstably bound photon orbits around the black hole. This critical curve has a size and shape that are purely governed by the Kerr geometry; in contrast, the size, shape, and depth of the observed brightness depression all depend on the details of the emission region. For instance, images of spherical accretion models display a distinctive dark region -- the \"black hole shadow\" -- that completely fills the photon ring. By contrast, in models of equatorial disks extending to the black hole's event horizon, the darkest region in the image is restricted to a much smaller area -- an inner shadow -- whose edge lies near the direct lensed image of the equatorial horizon. Using both semi-analytic models and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, we demonstrate that the photon ring and inner shadow may be simultaneously visible in submillimeter images of M87*, where magnetically arrested disk (MAD) simulations predict that the emission arises in a thin region near the equatorial plane. We show that the relative size, shape, and centroid of the photon ring and inner shadow can be used to estimate the black hole mass and spin, breaking degeneracies in measurements of these quantities that rely on the photon ring alone. Both features may be accessible to direct observation via high-dynamic-range images with a next-generation Event Horizon Telescope.",

Simulating the formation of realistic star clusters with hydro-dynamical simulations is a computational challenge, considering that only the statistically averaged results of large batches of simulations are reliable, due to the chaotic nature of the gravitational N-body problem. While large sets of initial conditions for N-body runs can be produced by hydro-dynamical simulations of star formation, this is prohibitively expensive in terms of computational time. Here we address this issue by introducing a new technique for generating many sets of new initial conditions from a given set of star masses, positions and velocities from a hydro-dynamical simulation. We use hierarchical clustering in phase space to learn a tree representation of the spatial and kinematic relations between stars. This constitutes the basis for the random generation of new sets of stars which share the same clustering structure of the original ones but have individually different masses, positions, and velocities. We apply this method to the output of a number of hydro-dynamical star-formation simulations, comparing the generated initial conditions to the original ones through a series of quantitative tests, including comparing mass and velocity distributions and fractal dimension. Finally, we evolve both the original and the generated star clusters using a direct N-body code, obtaining a qualitatively similar evolution.",

The host star is bright (K = 7.1) and nearby (10.6 pc), making the system a prime target for follow-up characterization with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Herein, we use simulated transmission spectroscopy to evaluate the detectability of spectral features with HST and JWST assuming diverse atmospheric scenarios (e.g., atmospheres dominated by H2, H2O, CO2, or O2). We find that H2O and CH4 present in a low mean-molecular weight atmosphere could be detected with HST in 1 transit for the two outermost planets, while H2O in a clear steam atmosphere could be detected in 6 transits or fewer with HST for all three planets. We predict that observations using JWST/NIRISS would be capable of detecting a clear steam atmosphere in 1 transit for each planet, and H2O absorption in a hazy steam atmosphere in 2 transits or less. In a clear, desiccated atmosphere, O2 absorption may be detectable for all three planets with NIRISS. If the L 98-59 planets possess a clear, Venus-like atmosphere, NIRSpec could detect CO2 within 26 transits for each planet, but the presence of H2SO4 clouds would significantly suppress CO2 absorption. The L 98-59 system is an excellent laboratory for comparative planetary studies of transiting multiplanet systems, and observations of the system via HST and JWST would present a unique opportunity to test the accuracy of the models presented in this study.",

After elucidating in generality when a 5$d$ SCFT reduces to a 4$d$ one, we identify nearly all $\\mathcal{N}=1$ 5$d$ SCFT parents of rank-2 4$d$ $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs. We then use this result to map out the mass deformation trajectories among the rank-2 theories in 4$d$. This can be done by first understanding the mass deformations of the 5$d$ $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFTs and then map them to 4$d$. The former task can be easily achieved by exploiting the fact that the 5$d$ parent theories can be obtained as the strong coupling limit of Lagrangian theories, and the latter by understanding the behavior under compactification. Finally we identify a set of general criteria that 4$d$ moduli spaces of vacua have to satisfy when the corresponding SCFTs are related by mass deformations and check that all our RG-flows satisfy them. Many of the mass deformations we find are not visible from the corresponding complex integrable systems.",

However, the overhead, in terms of size, complexity and power budget, required by classical methods to exploit this information is often prohibitive for smaller-scale applications such as autonomous cars, drones or robotics. Here we propose a neuromorphic approach to perform vibration analysis using spiking neural networks that can be applied to a wide range of scenarios. We present a spike-based end-to-end pipeline able to detect system anomalies from vibration data, using building blocks that are compatible with analog-digital neuromorphic circuits. This pipeline operates in an online unsupervised fashion, and relies on a cochlea model, on feedback adaptation and on a balanced spiking neural network. We show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance or better against two publicly available data sets. Further, we demonstrate a working proof-of-concept implemented on an asynchronous neuromorphic processor device. This work represents a significant step towards the design and implementation of autonomous low-power edge-computing devices for online vibration monitoring.",

Straightforward ways to quantify the difference between two systems and more generally, two sets of multiplanetary systems, are useful tools in the study of this diversity. In this work we present a novel approach, using a Weighted extension of the Energy Distance (WED) metric, to quantify the difference between planetary systems on the logarithmic period-radius plane. We demonstrate the use of this metric and its relation to previously introduced descriptive measures to characterise the arrangements of Kepler planetary systems. By applying exploratory machine learning tools, we attempt to find whether there is some order that can be ascribed to the set of Kepler multiplanet system architectures. Based on WED, the 'Sequencer', which is such an automatic tool, identifies a progression from small and compact planetary systems to systems with distant giant planets. It is reassuring to see that a WED-based tool indeed identifies this progression. Next, we extend WED to define the Inter-Catalogue Energy Distance (ICED) - a distance metric between sets of multiplanetary systems. We have made the specific implementation presented in the paper available to the community through a public repository. We suggest to use these metrics as complementary tools in attempting to compare between architectures of planetary system, and in general, catalogues of planetary systems.",

Until recently the sample of objects with RM data was limited to low-luminosity AGNs ($L_{\\rm opt} \\lesssim 10^{46}$ ergs s$^{-1}$) and low redshifts ($z \\lesssim 0.5$). Here we present results from a reverberation-mapping project of some of the most luminous and highest redshift quasars that have been mapped to date. The study is based on almost twenty years of photometric monitoring of 11 quasars, six of which were monitored spectrophotometrically for 13 years. This is the longest reverberation-mapping project carried out so far on this type of AGNs. We successfully measure a time lag between the CIV$\\lambda$1549 broad emission line and the quasar continuum in three objects, and measure a CIII$\\lambda$1909 lag in one quasar. Together with recently published data on CIV reverberation mapping, the BLR size is found to scale as the square root of the UV luminosity over eight orders of magnitude in AGN luminosity. There is a significant scatter in the relation, part of which may be intrinsic to the AGNs. Although the CIV line is probably less well suited than Balmer lines for determination of the mass of the black hole, virial masses are tentatively computed and in spite of a large scatter we find that the mass of the black hole scales as the square root of the UV luminosity.",

[...] We present a method to derive accurate timescales of the different evolutionary phases of the high-mass star formation process. We model a representative number of massive clumps of the ATLASGAL-TOP100 sample which cover all the evolutionary stages. The models describe an isothermal collapse and the subsequent warm-up phase, for which we follow their chemical evolution. The timescale of each phase is derived by comparing the results of the models with the properties of the sources of the ATLASGAL-TOP100 sample, taking into account the mass and luminosity of the clumps, and the column densities of methyl acetylene (CH$_3$CCH), acetonitrile (CH$_3$CN), formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and methanol (CH$_3$OH). We find that the chosen molecular tracers are affected by the thermal evolution of the clumps, showing steep ice evaporation gradients from 10$^3$ to 10$^5$ AU during the warm-up phase. We succeed in reproducing the observed column densities of CH$_3$CCH and CH$_3$CN, while H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH show a poorer agreement with the observed values. The total (massive) star formation time is found to be $\\sim5.2\\times10^5$ yr, which is defined by the timescales of the individual evolutionary phases of the ATLASGAL-TOP100 sample: $\\sim5\\times10^4$ yr for 70-$\\mu$m weak, $\\sim1.2\\times10^5$ yr for mid-IR weak, $\\sim2.4\\times10^5$ yr for mid-IR bright and $\\sim1.1\\times10^5$ yr for HII-regions phases. Our models, with an appropriate selection of molecular tracers that can act as chemical clocks, allow to get robust estimates of the duration of the individual phases of the high-mass star formation process, with the advantage of being capable to include additional tracers aimed at increasing the accuracy of the estimated timescales.",

The mechanism may also be utilized to determine symmetries during training, when parameters are correlated, as well as symmetries of the Neural Tangent Kernel.

Using PdCoO$_2$ as a model system, we study different microscopic electron and phonon scattering mechanisms and establish the mean free path hierarchy of quasiparticles at different temperatures. We treat the anisotropic Fermi surface explicitly to numerically obtain experimentally-accessible transport observables, which bridge between the \"diffusive\", \"ballistic\", and \"hydrodynamic\" transport regime limits. We illustrate that distinction between the \"quasi-ballistic\", and \"quasi-hydrodynamic\" regimes is challenging and often needs to be quantitative in nature. From first-principles calculations, we populate the resulting transport regime plots, and demonstrate how the Fermi surface orientation adds complexity to the observed transport signatures in micro-scale devices. Our work provides key insights into microscopic interaction mechanisms on open hexagonal Fermi surfaces and establishes their connection to the macroscopic electron transport in finite-size channels.",

In this review, we discuss the main formation channels of BBHs from stellar evolution and dynamics. Uncertainties on massive star evolution (e.g., stellar winds, rotation, overshooting and nuclear reaction rates), core-collapse supernovae and pair instability still hamper our comprehension of the mass spectrum and spin distribution of black holes (BHs), but substantial progress has been done in the field over the last few years. On top of this, the efficiency of mass transfer in a binary system and the physics of common envelope substantially affect the final BBH demography. Dynamical processes in dense stellar systems can trigger the formation of BHs in the mass gap and intermediate-mass BHs via hierarchical BH mergers and via multiple stellar collisions. Finally, we discuss the importance of reconstructing the cosmic evolution of BBHs.",

Central compact objects (CCOs) are a peculiar class of neutron stars, primarily encountered close to the center of young supernova remnants (SNRs) and characterized by thermal X-ray emission. Aims. Our goal is to perform a systematic study of the proper motion of all known CCOs with appropriate data available. In addition, we aim to measure the expansion of three SNRs within our sample to obtain a direct handle on their kinematics and age. Methods. We analyze multiple archival Chandra data sets, consisting of HRC and ACIS observations separated by temporal baselines between 8 and 15 years. In order to correct for systematic astrometric uncertainties, we establish a reference frame using X-ray detected sources in Gaia DR2, to provide accurate proper motion estimates for our target CCOs. Complementarily, we use our coaligned data sets to trace the expansion of three SNRs by directly measuring the spatial offset of various filaments and ejecta clumps between different epochs. Results. In total, we present new proper motion measurements for six CCOs, among which we do not find any indication of a hypervelocity object. We tentatively identify direct signatures of expansion for the SNRs G15.9+0.2 and Kes 79, at estimated significance of $2.5\\sigma$ and $2\\sigma$, respectively. Moreover, we confirm recent results by Borkowski et al., measuring the rapid expansion of G350.1$-$0.3 at almost $6000\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$, which places its maximal age at $600-700$ years. The observed expansion, combined with the rather small proper motion of its CCO, implies the need for a very inhomogeneous circumstellar medium to explain the highly asymmetric appearance of the SNR. Finally, for the SNR RX J1713.7$-$3946, we combine previously published expansion measurements with our measurement of the CCO's proper motion to obtain a constraining upper limit of $1700$ years on the system's age.",

In particular, digraphs with a restricted numerical range of a single point, a horizontal line segment, and a vertical line segment were characterized as $k$-imploding stars, directed joins of bidirectional digraphs, and regular tournaments, respectively. In this article, we extend these results by investigating digraphs whose restricted numerical range is a convex polygon in the complex plane. We provide computational methods for identifying these polygonal digraphs and show that these digraphs can be broken into three disjoint classes: normal, restricted-normal, and pseudo-normal digraphs, all of which are closed under the digraph complement. We prove sufficient conditions for normal digraphs and show that the directed join of two normal digraphs results in a restricted-normal digraph. Also, we prove that directed joins are the only restricted-normal digraphs when the order is square-free or twice a square-free number. Finally, we provide methods to construct restricted-normal digraphs that are not directed joins for all orders that are neither square-free nor twice a square-free number.",

The interplay between functional robustness and behavioral variability is exemplified at the organellar level by the beating of cilia and flagella. The complex bending patterns of cilia emerge from the coordinated activities of hundreds of different proteins. Cilia are motile despite wide genetic diversity between and within species, large differences in intracellular concentrations of ATP and calcium, and considerable environment fluctuations in temperature and viscosity. At the same time, these perturbations result in a variety of spatio-temporal patterns that span a rich, and as of yet uncharted, behavioral space. To investigate this behavioral space we analyzed the dynamics of isolated cilia from the unicellular algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in thirty four different environmental and genetic conditions. We found that, despite large changes in beat frequency and amplitude, the space of waveform shapes is low-dimensional. Two features, parabolicity and asymmetry of the tangent angle, account for eighty per cent of the observed variation. Remarkably, the geometry of this behavioral space accords with the predictions of a simple mechanochemical model in the low viscosity regime. This allowed us to associate waveform shape variability with changes in only the curvature response coefficients of the dynein motors. Our work demonstrates that, despite the molecular complexity of the cilium, the space of beat variations is low dimensional and can be attributed to variation in mechanochemical regulation of the dynein motors.",

That said, the standard method can become arbitrarily stiff when characteristic boundary conditions and nonlinear interface conditions are used. Here we propose a new technique that avoids this stiffness by using characteristic variables to \"upwind\" the boundary and interface treatment. This is done through the introduction of an additional block boundary displacement variable. Using a unified energy, which expresses both the standard as well as characteristic boundary and interface treatment, we show that the resulting scheme has semidiscrete energy stability for the anistropic wave equation. The theoretical stability results are confirmed with numerical experiments that also demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed scheme. The numerical results also show that the characteristic scheme has a time step restriction based on standard wave propagation considerations and not the boundary closure.",

We find valued-based reinforcement learning methods with {\\epsilon}-greedy mechanism are capable of enjoying three characteristics, Closed-form Diversity, Objective-invariant Exploration and Adaptive Trade-off, which help value-based methods avoid the policy collapse problem. However, there does not exist a parallel mechanism for policy-based methods that achieves all three characteristics. In this paper, we propose an entropy regularization free mechanism that is designed for policy-based methods, which achieves Closed-form Diversity, Objective-invariant Exploration and Adaptive Trade-off. Our experiments show that our mechanism is super sample-efficient for policy-based methods and boosts a policy-based baseline to a new State-Of-The-Art on Arcade Learning Environment.",

Both SNRs emit strong nonthermal X-rays and TeV $\\gamma$-rays, and they contain clumpy distributions of interstellar gas that includes both atomic and molecular hydrogen. We find that shock-cloud interactions provide a viable explanation for the spatial correlation between the X-rays and ISM. In these interactions, the supernova shocks hit the typically pc-scale dense cores, generating a highly turbulent velocity field that amplifies the magnetic field up to 0.1-1 mG. This amplification leads to enhanced nonthermal synchrotron emission around the clumps, whereas the cosmic-ray electrons do not penetrate the clumps. Accordingly, the nonthermal X-rays exhibit a spatial distribution similar to that of the ISM on the pc scale, while they are anticorrelated at sub-pc scales. These results predict that hadronic $\\gamma$-rays can be emitted from the dense cores, resulting in a spatial correspondence between the $\\gamma$-rays and the ISM. The current pc-scale resolution of $\\gamma$-ray observations is too low to resolve this correspondence. Future $\\gamma$-ray observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array will be able to resolve the sub-pc-scale $\\gamma$-ray distribution and provide clues to the origin of these cosmic $\\gamma$-rays.",

We first briefly review the concepts of band theory and topology, as well as the experimental methods used to demonstrate nontrivial topology in solid-state materials. We then review the past 15 years of topological materials discovery, including the identification of the first nonmagnetic TIs, topological crystalline insulators (TCIs), and topological semimetals (TSMs). Most recently, through complete analyses of symmetry-allowed band structures - including the theory of Topological Quantum Chemistry (TQC) - researchers have determined crystal-symmetry-enhanced Wilson-loop and complete symmetry-based indicators for nonmagnetic topological phases, leading to the discovery of higher-order TCIs and TSMs. Lastly, we discuss the recent application of TQC and related methods to high-throughput materials discovery, which revealed that over half of all of the known stoichiometric, solid-state, nonmagnetic materials are topological at the Fermi level, over 85% of the known stoichiometric materials host energetically isolated topological bands, and that just under $2/3$ of the energetically isolated bands in known materials carry the stable topology of a TI or TCI. We conclude by discussing future venues for the identification and manipulation of solid-state topological phases, including charge-density-wave compounds, magnetic materials, and 2D few-layer devices.",

To address this problem, we construct PEPOs that approximate, for all local observables, \\emph{i)} their thermal expectation values and \\emph{ii)} their Heisenberg time evolution. The bond dimension required does not depend on system size, but only on the temperature or time. We also show how these can be used to approximate thermal correlation functions and expectation values in quantum quenches.",

Due to its characteristics and strategy of observation, this survey will let us analyze a great number of Solar System small bodies, with improved spectrophotometric resolution with respect to previous large-area photometric surveys in optical wavelengths. Aims: The main goal of this work is to present here the first catalog of magnitudes and colors of minor bodies of the Solar System compiled using the first data release (DR1) of the J-PLUS observational campaign: the Moving Objects Observed from Javalambre (MOOJa) catalog. Methods: Using the compiled photometric data we obtained very-low-resolution reflectance (photospectra) spectra of the asteroids. We first used a {\\sigma}-clipping algorithm in order to remove outliers and clean the data. We then devised a method to select the optimal solar colors in the J-PLUS photometric system. These solar colors were computed using two different approaches: on one hand, we used different spectra of the Sun, convolved with the filter transmissions of the J-PLUS system, and on the other, we selected a group of solar-type stars in the J-PLUS DR1, according to their computed stellar parameters. Finally, we used the solar colors to obtain the reflectance spectra of the asteroids. Results: We present photometric data in the J-PLUS filters for a total of 3 122 minor bodies (3 666 before outlier removal), and we discuss the main issues of the data, as well as some guidelines to solve them",

Taking billiard 3-periodics as an example, the third point is the mittenpunkt. We derive conditions under which a locus degenerates to a segment or is a circle. We show a locus turning number is either plus or minus 3 and predict its movement monotonicity with respect to vertices of the 3-periodic family. Finally, we derive a (long) expression for the loci of the incenter and excenters over a generic Poncelet 3-periodic family, showing they are roots of a quartic. We conjecture (i) those loci are convex, and (ii) that they can only be ellipses if the pair is confocal, i.e., within a 1d subspace of the 5d space of ellipse pairs which admit 3-periodics.",

        "abstract": "Collaborative Mobile crowdsourcing (CMCS) allows entities, e.g., local authorities or individuals, to hire a team of workers from the crowd of connected people, to execute complex tasks. In this paper, we investigate two different CMCS recruitment strategies allowing task requesters to form teams of socially connected and skilled workers: i) a platform-based strategy where the platform exploits its own knowledge about the workers to form a team and ii) a leader-based strategy where the platform designates a group leader that recruits its own suitable team given its own knowledge about its Social Network (SN) neighbors. We first formulate the recruitment as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) that optimally forms teams according to four fuzzy-logic-based criteria: level of expertise, social relationship strength, recruitment cost, and recruiter's confidence level. To cope with NP-hardness, we design a novel low-complexity CMCS recruitment approach relying on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), specifically graph embedding and clustering techniques, to shrink the workers' search space and afterwards, exploiting a meta-heuristic genetic algorithm to select appropriate workers. Simulation results applied on a real-world dataset illustrate the performance of both proposed CMCS recruitment approaches. It is shown that our proposed low-complexity GNN-based recruitment algorithm achieves close performances to those of the baseline ILP with significant computational time saving and ability to operate on large-scale mobile crowdsourcing platforms. It is also shown that compared to the leader-based strategy, the platform-based strategy recruits a more skilled team but with lower SN relationships and higher cost.",

We define general utility public goods games, and prove a complexity dichotomy result for finding pure equilibria, and a PPAD-completeness proof for mixed Nash equilibria. Even in the divisible goods variant of the problem, where existence is easy to prove, finding the equilibrium is PPAD-complete.

Nonstationary multi-variate Gaussian process models (NMGP) use a nonstationary covariance function with an input-dependent linear model of coregionalisation to jointly model input-dependent correlation, scale, and smoothness of outputs. Variational sparse approximation relies on inducing points to enable scalable computations. Here, we take the best of both worlds: considering an inducing variable framework on the underlying latent functions in NMGP, we propose a novel model called the collaborative nonstationary Gaussian process model(CNMGP). For CNMGP, we derive computationally tractable variational bounds amenable to doubly stochastic variational inference. Together, this allows us to model data in which outputs do not share a common input set, with a computational complexity that is independent of the size of the inputs and outputs. We illustrate the performance of our method on synthetic data and three real datasets and show that our model generally pro-vides better predictive performance than the state-of-the-art, and also provides estimates of time-varying correlations that differ across outputs.",

This problem is aggravated across many domains where datasets are class imbalanced, with a minority class far rarer than the majority class. Naive approaches to handle under-representation and class imbalance include training sub-population specific classifiers that handle class imbalance or training a global classifier that overlooks sub-population disparities and aims to achieve high overall accuracy by handling class imbalance. In this study, we find that these approaches are vulnerable in class imbalanced datasets with minority sub-populations. We introduced Fair-Net, a branched multitask neural network architecture that improves both classification accuracy and probability calibration across identifiable sub-populations in class imbalanced datasets. Fair-Nets is a straightforward extension to the output layer and error function of a network, so can be incorporated in far more complex architectures. Empirical studies with three real world benchmark datasets demonstrate that Fair-Net improves classification and calibration performance, substantially reducing performance disparity between gender and racial sub-populations.",

We show that GaSb films grow on graphene-terminated GaSb (001) via a seeded lateral epitaxy mechanism, in which pinhole defects in the graphene serve as selective nucleation sites, followed by lateral epitaxy and coalescence into a continuous film. Importantly, the small size of the pinholes permits exfoliation of a continuous, free-standing GaSb membrane. By combining molecular beam epitaxy with \\textit{in-situ} electron diffraction and photoemission, plus \\textit{ex-situ} atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, we track the graphene defect generation and GaSb growth evolution a few monolayers at a time.

Here, we demonstrate multi-axis coherent control of the SnV spin qubit via an all-optical stimulated Raman drive between the ground and excited states. We use coherent population trapping and optically driven electronic spin resonance to confirm coherent access to the qubit at 1.7 K, and obtain spin Rabi oscillations at a rate of $\\Omega/2\\pi$=3.6(1) MHz. All-optical Ramsey interferometry reveals a spin dephasing time of $T_2^*$=1.3(3)$\\mu$s and two-pulse dynamical decoupling already extends the spin coherence time to $T_2$=0.33(14) ms.

        "abstract": "Mini-proteins and peptides manifest dynamic conformational fluctuation and involve mutual interconversion among metastable states. A robust mapping of the conformational landscape underlying mini-proteins and peptides often requires low-dimensional projection of the conformational ensemble along optimized collective variables. However, the traditional choice for the collective variable (CV) is often limited by user-intuition and prior knowledge about the system, which lacks a rigorous assessment of their optimality over other candidate CVs. To address this issue, we propose a generic approach in which we first choose the possible combinations of inter-residue Calpha-distances within a given macromolecule as a set of input CVs. Subsequently we derive a non-linear combination of latent-space embedded collective variables via auto-encoding the unbiased MD simulation trajectories within the framework of feed-forward neural network. We demonstrate the ability of the derived latent space variables in elucidating the conformational landscape in three hierarchically complex systems. When the conformational dynamics is resolved along the latent space CVs, it identifies key metastable states of a bead-in-a-spring polymer. The combination of the adopted dimensionally reduction technique with a Markov state model, built on the derived latent space, efficiently projects the free energy landscape of GB1 beta-hairpin, revealing multiple spatially well-resolved and kinetically well-separated metastable conformations. A quantitative comparison based on variational approach to Markov Process of the auto encoder-derived latent-space CVs with the ones obtained PCA or TICA confirms the optimality of the former. Finally, as a practical application, we demonstrate that the auto-encoder derived CVs successfully predict the reinforced folding of Trp-cage mini-protein in an aqueous osmolyte solution.",

Over the past decade, tremendous efforts have been made to develop scalable high-fidelity two-qubit gates with superconducting quantum circuits. Recently, an easy-to-scale controlled-phase gate scheme that utilizes the tunable-coupling architecture with fixed-frequency qubits [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 240502; Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 240503] has been demonstrated with high fidelity and attracted broad interest. However, in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanism is still missing, preventing us from fully exploiting its potential. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical study, explaining the origin of the high-contrast ZZ interaction. Based on improved understanding, we develop a general yet convenient method for shaping an adiabatic pulse in a multilevel system, and identify how to optimize the gate performance from design. Given state-of-the-art coherence properties, we expect the scheme to potentially achieve a two-qubit gate error rate near $10^{-5}$, which would drastically speed up the progress towards fault-tolerant quantum computation.",

        "abstract": "This study considers modern surgical navigation systems based on augmented reality technologies. Augmented reality glasses are used to construct holograms of the patient's organs from MRI and CT data, subsequently transmitted to the glasses. This, in addition to seeing the actual patient, the surgeon gains visualization inside the patient's body (bones, soft tissues, blood vessels, etc.). The solutions developed at Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University allow reducing the invasiveness of the procedure and preserving healthy tissues. This also improves the navigation process, making it easier to estimate the location and size of the tumor to be removed. We describe the application of developed systems to different types of surgical operations (removal of a malignant brain tumor, removal of a cyst of the cervical spine). We consider the specifics of novel navigation systems designed for anesthesia, for endoscopic operations. Furthermore, we discuss the construction of novel visualization systems for ultrasound machines. Our findings indicate that the technologies proposed show potential for telemedicine.",

Real world e-commerce applications like personalized recommendations and product advertising can be formulated as XMC problems, where the objective is to predict for a user a small subset of items from a catalog of several million products. For such applications, a common approach is to organize these labels into a tree, enabling training and inference times that are logarithmic in the number of labels. While training a model once a label tree is available is well studied, designing the structure of the tree is a difficult task that is not yet well understood, and can dramatically impact both model latency and statistical performance. Existing approaches to tree construction fall at an extreme point, either optimizing exclusively for statistical performance, or for latency. We propose an efficient information theory inspired algorithm to construct intermediary operating points that trade off between the benefits of both. Our algorithm enables interpolation between these objectives, which was not previously possible. We corroborate our theoretical analysis with numerical results, showing that on the Wiki-500K benchmark dataset our method can reduce a proxy for expected latency by up to 28% while maintaining the same accuracy as Parabel. On several datasets derived from e-commerce customer logs, our modified label tree is able to improve this expected latency metric by up to 20% while maintaining the same accuracy. Finally, we discuss challenges in realizing these latency improvements in deployed models.",

In particular charge order in the form of charge density waves (CDW), i.e., the incommensurate modulation of electron density in the CuO$_2$ planes, is ubiquitous across different families and presents a clear interplay with superconductivity. Until recently, CDW had been found to be confined inside a rather small region of the phase diagram, below the pseudogap temperature and the optimal doping. This occurrence might shed doubts on the possibility that such \"low temperature phenomenon\" actually rules the properties of cuprates either in the normal or in the superconducting states. However, recent resonant X-ray scattering (RXS) experiments are overturning this paradigm. It results that very short-ranged charge modulations permeate a much wider region of the phase diagram, coexisting with CDW at lower temperatures and persisting up to temperatures well above the pseudogap opening. Here we review the characteristics of these high temperature charge modulations, which are present in several cuprate families, with similarities and differences. A particular emphasis is put on their dynamical character and on their coupling to lattice and magnetic excitations, properties that can be determined with high resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS).",

These models include a wide range of qualities and were trained with a range of architectures and regularization hyperparameters. We identify what amounts to a Simpson's paradox: where \"scale\" metrics (from traditional statistical learning theory) perform well overall but perform poorly on subpartitions of the data of a given depth, when regularization hyperparameters are varied; and where \"shape\" metrics (from Heavy-Tailed Self Regularization theory) perform well on subpartitions of the data, when hyperparameters are varied for models of a given depth, but perform poorly overall when models with varying depths are aggregated. Our results highlight the subtly of comparing models when both architectures and hyperparameters are varied, as well as the complementary role of implicit scale versus implicit shape parameters in understanding NN model quality. Our results also suggest caution when one tries to extract causal insight with a single metric applied to aggregate data, and they highlight the need to go beyond one-size-fits-all metrics based on upper bounds from generalization theory to describe the performance of state-of-the-art NN models. Based on these findings, we present two novel shape metrics, one data-independent, and the other data-dependent, which can predict trends in the test accuracy of a series of NNs, of a fixed architecture/depth, when varying solver hyperparameters.",

Specifically, Fokker-Planck equations, which model the diffusion of probability measures, can be understood as gradient descent over entropy functionals in Wasserstein space. This equivalence, introduced by Jordan, Kinderlehrer and Otto, inspired the so-called JKO scheme to approximate these diffusion processes via an implicit discretization of the gradient flow in Wasserstein space. Solving the optimization problem associated to each JKO step, however, presents serious computational challenges. We introduce a scalable method to approximate Wasserstein gradient flows, targeted to machine learning applications. Our approach relies on input-convex neural networks (ICNNs) to discretize the JKO steps, which can be optimized by stochastic gradient descent. Unlike previous work, our method does not require domain discretization or particle simulation. As a result, we can sample from the measure at each time step of the diffusion and compute its probability density. We demonstrate our algorithm's performance by computing diffusions following the Fokker-Planck equation and apply it to unnormalized density sampling as well as nonlinear filtering.",

        "abstract": "Many high-energy astrophysical systems contain magnetized collisionless plasmas with relativistic particles, in which turbulence can be driven by an arbitrary mixture of solenoidal and compressive motions. For example, turbulence in hot accretion flows may be driven solenoidally by the magnetorotational instability or compressively by spiral shock waves. It is important to understand the role of the driving mechanism on kinetic turbulence and the associated particle energization. In this work, we compare particle-in-cell simulations of solenoidally driven turbulence with similar simulations of compressively driven turbulence. We focus on plasma that has an initial beta of unity, relativistically hot electrons, and varying ion temperature. Apart from strong large-scale density fluctuations in the compressive case, the turbulence statistics are similar for both drives, and the bulk plasma is described reasonably well by an isothermal equation of state. We find that nonthermal particle acceleration is more efficient when turbulence is driven compressively. In the case of relativistically hot ions, both driving mechanisms ultimately lead to similar power-law particle energy distributions, but over a different duration. In the case of non-relativistic ions, there is significant nonthermal particle acceleration only for compressive driving. Additionally, we find that the electron-to-ion heating ratio is less than unity for both drives, but takes a smaller value for compressive driving. We demonstrate that this additional ion energization is associated with the collisionless damping of large-scale compressive modes via perpendicular electric fields.",

This allows the continuous updating/improvement of the current policy, thus resulting in a form of on-line PI that incorporates the improved controls into the current policy as new states and controls are generated. The algorithm converges in a finite number of stages to a type of locally optimal policy, and suggests the possibility of variants of PI and multiagent PI where the policy improvement is simplified. Moreover, the algorithm can be used with on-line replanning, and is also well-suited for on-line PI algorithms with value and policy approximations.",

We provide a general algorithm for evaluating derivatives of all orders, which has not been previously described in the literature. In the case of second-order derivatives, our scheme runs in the optimal $\\mathcal{O}(A^2 N^4)$ time where $A$ is the alphabet size and $N$ is the number of states. Our algorithm is significantly faster than prior algorithms.

In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework for learning generalizable representations for non-stationary time series. Our approach, called Temporal Neighborhood Coding (TNC), takes advantage of the local smoothness of a signal's generative process to define neighborhoods in time with stationary properties. Using a debiased contrastive objective, our framework learns time series representations by ensuring that in the encoding space, the distribution of signals from within a neighborhood is distinguishable from the distribution of non-neighboring signals. Our motivation stems from the medical field, where the ability to model the dynamic nature of time series data is especially valuable for identifying, tracking, and predicting the underlying patients' latent states in settings where labeling data is practically impossible. We compare our method to recently developed unsupervised representation learning approaches and demonstrate superior performance on clustering and classification tasks for multiple datasets.",

The chemical reactions of the model may involve detailed reaction mechanisms for the description of the physicochemical phenomena. One of the biggest challenges is the stiffness of the numerical simulation of these models and the nonlinear nature of species rate of reaction. This work presents a study of in situ adaptive tabulation (ISAT) technique, focusing on the accuracy, efficiency, and memory usage in the simulation of homogeneous stirred reactor models using simple and complex reaction mechanisms. The combustion of carbon monoxide with oxygen and methane with air mixtures are considered, using detailed reaction mechanisms with 4 and 53 species, 3 and 325 reactions, respectively. The results of these simulations indicate that the developed implementation of ISAT technique has a absolute global error smaller than 1 %. Moreover, ISAT technique provides gains, in terms of computational time, of up to 80% when compared with the direct integration of the full chemical kinetics. However, in terms of memory usage the present implementation of ISAT technique is found to be excessively demanding.",

In particular, we apply this to the Entropically Damped Artificial Compressibility SPH method. We identify the free-surface particles and their normals using a simple approach and thereby adapt the method for free-surface problems. We show how the new method can be applied to the problem of elastic dynamics.

At the trial of Ben Geen, a statistical expert was refused permission to present evidence on statistical biases concerning the way suspicious cases were identified by a hospital team of investigators. The judge ruled that the expert's written evidence was merely common sense. An application to the CCRC to review the case was turned down, since the application only presented statistical evidence but did not re-address the medical evidence presented at the original trials. This rejection has been successfully challenged in court, and the CCRC has withdrawn it. The paper includes some striking new statistical findings on the Ben Geen case as well as giving advice to statisticians involved in future cases, which are not infrequent. Statisticians need to be warned of the pitfalls which await them.",

The resulting inertial range is a power law with index -2. Indeed such power spectra were observed in various astrophysical settings and also in numerical simulations.",

However, recent studies highlight the importance of higher-order network analysis, where complex structures called motifs are the first-class citizens. We first show that existing link prediction schemes fail to effectively predict motifs. To alleviate this, we establish a general motif prediction problem and we propose several heuristics that assess the chances for a specified motif to appear. To make the scores realistic, our heuristics consider - among others - correlations between links, i.e., the potential impact of some arriving links on the appearance of other links in a given motif. Finally, for highest accuracy, we develop a graph neural network (GNN) architecture for motif prediction. Our architecture offers vertex features and sampling schemes that capture the rich structural properties of motifs. While our heuristics are fast and do not need any training, GNNs ensure highest accuracy of predicting motifs, both for dense (e.g., k-cliques) and for sparse ones (e.g., k-stars). We consistently outperform the best available competitor by more than 10% on average and up to 32% in area under the curve. Importantly, the advantages of our approach over schemes based on uncorrelated link prediction increase with the increasing motif size and complexity. We also successfully apply our architecture for predicting more arbitrary clusters and communities, illustrating its potential for graph mining beyond motif analysis.",

In this work, we proposed HisVA, a visual analytics system that allows the efficient exploration of historical events from Wikipedia using three views: event, map, and resource. HisVA provides an effective event exploration space, where users can investigate relationships among historical events by reviewing and linking them in terms of space and time.

In such codes, each qubit only affects a constant number of syndrome bits, and each syndrome bit only relies on some constant number of qubits. Constructing quantum LDPC codes is challenging. It is an open problem to understand if there exist good quantum LDPC codes, i.e. with constant rate and relative distance. Furthermore, techniques to perform fault-tolerant gates are poorly understood. We present a unified way to address these problems. Our main results are a) a bound on the distance, b) a bound on the code dimension and c) limitations on certain fault-tolerant gates that can be applied to quantum LDPC codes. All three of these bounds are cast as a function of the graph separator of the connectivity graph representation of the quantum code. We find that unless the connectivity graph contains an expander, the code is severely limited. This implies a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to construct good codes. This is the first bound that studies the limitations of quantum LDPC codes that does not rely on locality. As an application, we present novel bounds on quantum LDPC codes associated with local graphs in $D$-dimensional hyperbolic space.",

It is therefore necessary to provide an accurate treatment of the blue wing of the Lyman-alpha line that enables correct calculations of radiative transport in DA and DBA white dwarf stars. On the theoretical front, we very recently developed very accurate H-He potential energies for the hydrogen 1s, 2s, and 2p states. Nevertheless, an uncertainty remained about the asymptotic correlation of the Sigma states and the electronic dipole transition moments. A similar difficulty occurred in our first calculations for the resonance broadening of hydrogen perturbed by collisions with neutral H atoms. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we clarify the question of the asymptotic correlation of the Sigma states, and we show that relativistic contributions, even very tiny, may need to be accounted for a correct long-range and asymptotic description of the states because of the specific 2s 2p Coulomb degeneracy in hydrogen. This effect of relativistic corrections, inducing small splitting of the 2s and 2p states of H, is shown to be important for the Sigma-Sigma$ transition dipole moments in H-He and is also discussed in H-H. Second, we use existent (H-H) and newly determined (H-He) accurate potentials and properties to provide a theoretical investigation of the collisional effects on the blue wing of the Lyman-alpha line of H perturbed by He and H. We study the relative contributions in the blue wing of the H and He atoms according to their relative densities. We finally achieve a comparison with recent COS observations and propose an assignment for a feature centered at 1190 A.",

The huge available data require cleaning and classification to properly process them and derive reorder point (ROP) estimation, reorder quantity (ROQ) estimation, and associated service level analysis. Finally, from 247000 items used in 9 years long, 1416 inventory items are elected as a result of ABC analysis integrating with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which led to the main items that need to be kept under strict inventory control.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a regularization technique for noisy-image super-resolution and image denoising. Total variation (TV) regularization is adopted in many image processing applications to preserve the local smoothness. However, TV prior is prone to oversmoothness, staircasing effect, and contrast losses. Nonlocal TV (NLTV) mitigates the contrast losses by adaptively weighting the smoothness based on the similarity measure of image patches. Although it suppresses the noise effectively in the flat regions, it might leave residual noise surrounding the edges especially when the image is not oversmoothed. To address this problem, we propose the bilateral spectrum weighted total variation (BSWTV). Specially, we apply a locally adaptive shrink coefficient to the image gradients and employ the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the weighted image gradients to effectively refine the weighting map and suppress the residual noise. In conjunction with the data fidelity term derived from a mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise model, the objective function is decomposed and solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. In order to remove outliers and facilitate the convergence stability, the weighting map is smoothed by a Gaussian filter with an iteratively decreased kernel width and updated in a momentum-based manner in each ADMM iteration. We benchmark our method with the state-of-the-art approaches on the public real-world datasets for super-resolution and image denoising. Experiments show that the proposed method obtains outstanding performance for super-resolution and achieves promising results for denoising on real-world images.",

But as the programs we write grow more complex, it becomes hard to apply traditional software to applications like computer vision or natural language. Although deep learning programs have demonstrated strong performance on these applications, they sacrifice many of the functionalities of traditional software programs. In this paper, we work towards bridging the benefits of traditional and deep learning programs by jointly training a generative model to constrain neural network activations to \"decode\" back to inputs. Doing so enables practitioners to probe and track information encoded in activation(s), apply assertion-like constraints on what information is encoded in an activation, and compose separate neural networks together in a plug-and-play fashion. In our experiments, we demonstrate applications of decodable representations to out-of-distribution detection, adversarial examples, calibration, and fairness -- while matching standard neural networks in accuracy.",

In this work, we use first-principles many-body perturbation theory to study a prototypical 2D ferromagnetic semiconductor, monolayer chromium tribromide (CrBr$_3$). With broken time-reversal symmetry, spin-orbit coupling, and excitonic effects included through the full-spinor $GW$ and $GW$ plus Bethe-Salpeter equation ($GW$-BSE) methods, we compute the frequency-dependent dielectric function tensor that governs the optical and magneto-optical properties. In addition, we provide a detailed theoretical formalism for simulating magnetic circular dichroism, magneto-optical Kerr effect, and Faraday effect, demonstrating the approach with monolayer CrBr$_3$. Due to reduced dielectric screening in 2D and localized nature of the Cr d orbitals, we find strong self-energy effects on the quasiparticle band structure of monolayer CrBr$_3$ that give a 3.8 eV indirect band gap. Also, excitonic effects dominate the low-energy optical and magneto-optical responses in monolayer CrBr$_3$ where a large exciton binding energy of 2.3 eV is found for the lowest bright exciton state with excitation energy at 1.5 eV. We further find that the magneto-optical signals demonstrate strong dependence on the excitation frequency and substrate refractive index. Our theoretical framework for modelling optical and magneto-optical effects could serve as a powerful theoretical tool for future study of optoelectronic and spintronics devices consisting of van der Waals 2D magnets.",

The performance is evaluated in terms of the average harvested energy and the outage probability for random and equal phase shifts. Closed-form analytical expressions for both metrics under spatial correlation are derived. Moreover, the optimal case is considered when the elements are uncorrelated and fully correlated. In the uncorrelated case, random and equal phase shifts provide the same performance. However, the performance of correlated elements attains significant gains when there are equal phase shifts.

Features that are relevant for accurate decisions may however lead to either explicit or implicit forms of discrimination against unprivileged groups, such as those of certain race or gender. This happens due to existing biases in the training data, which are often replicated or even exacerbated by the learning algorithm. Identifying and measuring these biases at the data level is a challenging problem due to the interdependence among the features, and the decision outcome. In this work, we develop a framework for fairness-aware feature selection which takes into account the correlation among the features and the decision outcome, and is based on information theoretic measures for the accuracy and discriminatory impacts of features. In particular, we first propose information theoretic measures which quantify the impact of different subsets of features on the accuracy and discrimination of the decision outcomes. We then deduce the marginal impact of each feature using Shapley value function; a solution concept in cooperative game theory used to estimate marginal contributions of players in a coalitional game. Finally, we design a fairness utility score for each feature (for feature selection) which quantifies how this feature influences accurate as well as nondiscriminatory decisions. Our framework depends on the joint statistics of the data rather than a particular classifier design. We examine our proposed framework on real and synthetic data to evaluate its performance.",

        "abstract": "Risk-sensitive safety analysis is a safety analysis method for stochastic systems on Borel spaces that uses a risk functional from finance called Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). CVaR provides a particularly expressive way to quantify the safety of a control system, as it represents the average cost in a fraction of worst cases. In prior work, the notion of a risk-sensitive safe set was defined in terms of a non-standard optimal control problem, in which a maximum cost is assessed via CVaR. Here, we provide a method to compute risk-sensitive safe sets exactly in principle by utilizing a state-space augmentation technique. In addition, we prove the existence of an optimal pre-commitment policy under a measurable selection condition. The proposed framework assumes continuous system dynamics and cost functions, but is otherwise flexible. In particular, it can accommodate probabilistic control policies, fairly general disturbance distributions, and control-dependent, non-monotonic, and non-convex stage costs. We demonstrate how risk-sensitive safety analysis is useful for a stormwater infrastructure application. Our numerical examples are inspired by current challenges that cities face in managing precipitation uncertainty.",

The fact that string theory landscape produces cosmological constant is a little bit unexpected result. It is also interesting that we, for one special choice of background fields, after rescalling space-time metric, made a possible connection to the Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC).

However, for many dependency parsing schemes, an important detail of this approach is that the spanning tree must have exactly one edge emanating from the root. While work has been done to efficiently solve this problem for finding the one-best dependency tree, no research has attempted to extend this solution to finding the $K$-best dependency trees. This is arguably a more important extension as a larger proportion of decoded trees will not be subject to the root constraint of dependency trees. Indeed, we show that the rate of root constraint violations increases by an average of $13$ times when decoding with $K\\!=\\!50$ as opposed to $K\\!=\\!1$. In this paper, we provide a simplification of the $K$-best spanning tree algorithm of Camerini et al. (1980). Our simplification allows us to obtain a constant time speed-up over the original algorithm. Furthermore, we present a novel extension of the algorithm for decoding the $K$-best dependency trees of a graph which are subject to a root constraint.",

Hence, the presence or absence of atomic Li has served as an indicator of the nearby H-burning boundary at about $75\\,M_{\\rm J}$ between brown-dwarfs and very low-mass stars. Historically the \"Lithium test\", a search for the presence and strength of the Li line at 670.8 nm, has been a marker if an object has a substellar mass with stellar-like spectral energy distribution (e.g., a late-type M dwarf). While the Li test could in principle also be used to distinguish masses of later-type L-T dwarfs, Li is predominantly no longer found as an atomic gas, but rather a molecular species such as LiH, LiF, LiOH, and LiCl in their cooler atmospheres. L- and T-type brown dwarfs are also quite faint at 670 nm and thus challenging targets for high resolution spectroscopy. But only recently have experimental molecular line lists become available for the molecular Li species, allowing molecular Li mass discrimination. In this study, we generated the latest opacity of each of these Li-bearing molecules and performed thermochemical equilibrium atmospheric composition calculation of the abundance of these molecules. Finally, we computed thermal emission spectra for a series of radiative-convective equilibrium models of cloudy and cloudless brown dwarf atmospheres (with $T_{\\rm eff}=$ 500--2400~K, and $\\log g$=4.0, 4.5, 5.0) to understand where the presence or absence of atmospheric lithium-bearing species is most easily detected as a function of brown dwarf mass and age. After atomic Li, the best spectral signatures were found to be LiF at $10.5-12.5$~\\micron and LiCl at $14.5-18.5$ $\\micron$. LiH also shows a narrow feature at $\\sim 9.38$ $\\micron$.",

A novel approach is suggested for provisioning the mandatory communication between serving data concentrator and its set of smart meters using this technology. The suggested approach is dependent on two main stages. The group of permissible cellular user equipment reuse candidates for every smart meter is calculated with taking the quality of service demands for cellular user devices and smart meters into consideration in the first stage. The optimal RR allocation for every smart meter is determined based on maximizing the access rate of smart meters which can be accepted and operated in D2D reuse mode in the second stage.

As large models are often not practical in real-world applications, we investigate and propose novel loss functions, to enable SR with high perceptual quality from much more efficient models. The representative power for a given low-complexity generator network can only be fully leveraged by strong guidance towards the optimal set of parameters. We show that it is possible to improve the performance of a recently introduced efficient generator architecture solely with the application of our proposed loss functions. In particular, we use a Fourier space supervision loss for improved restoration of missing high-frequency (HF) content from the ground truth image and design a discriminator architecture working directly in the Fourier domain to better match the target HF distribution. We show that our losses' direct emphasis on the frequencies in Fourier-space significantly boosts the perceptual image quality, while at the same time retaining high restoration quality in comparison to previously proposed loss functions for this task. The performance is further improved by utilizing a combination of spatial and frequency domain losses, as both representations provide complementary information during training. On top of that, the trained generator achieves comparable results with and is 2.4x and 48x faster than state-of-the-art perceptual SR methods RankSRGAN and SRFlow respectively.",

Nascent popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) has gained traction in public and government domains. Its usage in MDO may revolutionize future battlefields and may enable strategic advantage. While this technology offers leverage to military capabilities, it comes with challenges where one is the uncertainty and associated risk. A key question is how can these uncertainties be addressed. Recently published studies proposed information camouflage to transform information from one data domain to another. As this is comparatively a new approach, we investigate challenges of such transformations and how these associated uncertainties can be detected and addressed, specifically unknown-unknowns to improve decision-making.",

In many cases the dynamics of the interface determines the behavior of the flow. In a coarse, or reduced order model, it may therefore be important to retain a sharp interface for the resolved scales. Here, a process to coarsen or filter fully resolved numerical solutions for incompressible multiphase flows while retaining a sharp interface is examined. The different phases are identified by an index function that takes different values in each phase and is coarsened by solving a constant coefficient diffusion equation, while tracking the interface contour. Small flows scales of one phase, left behind when the interface is moved, are embedded in the other phase by solving another diffusion equation with a modified diffusion coefficient that is zero at the interface location to prevent diffusion across the interface, plus a pressure like equation to enforce incompressibility of the coarse velocity field. Examples of different levels of coarsening are shown. A simulation of a coarse model, where small scales are treated as a homogeneous mixture, results in a solution that is similar to the filtered fully resolved field for the early time Rayleigh-Taylor instability.",

To this end, we propose DYPLOC, a generation framework that conducts dynamic planning of content while generating the output based on a novel design of mixed language models. To enrich the generation with diverse content, we further propose to use large pre-trained models to predict relevant concepts and to generate claims. We experiment with two challenging tasks on newly collected datasets: (1) argument generation with Reddit ChangeMyView, and (2) writing articles using New York Times' Opinion section. Automatic evaluation shows that our model significantly outperforms competitive comparisons. Human judges further confirm that our generations are more coherent with richer content.",

A common challenge is achieving a precise implicit or explicit representation of the data probability density. Recent proposals have suggested using classifier weights to refine the learned density of deep generative models. We extend this idea to all types of generative models and show how latent space refinement via iterated generative modeling can circumvent topological obstructions and improve precision. This methodology also applies to cases were the target model is non-differentiable and has many internal latent dimensions which must be marginalized over before refinement. We demonstrate our Latent Space Refinement (LaSeR) protocol on a variety of examples, focusing on the combinations of Normalizing Flows and Generative Adversarial Networks.",

To address the challenge that free-text relations are ambiguous, previous methods exploit neighbor entities and relations for additional context. However, the predictions are made independently, which can be mutually inconsistent. We propose a two-stage Collective Relation Integration (CoRI) model, where the first stage independently makes candidate predictions, and the second stage employs a collective model that accesses all candidate predictions to make globally coherent predictions. We further improve the collective model with augmented data from the portion of the target KG that is otherwise unused. Experiment results on two datasets show that CoRI can significantly outperform the baselines, improving AUC from .677 to .748 and from .716 to .780, respectively.",

Despite the importance of these datasets for measuring and refining model understanding of language, there has been little focus on the crowdsourcing methods used for collecting the datasets. In this paper, we compare the efficacy of interventions that have been proposed in prior work as ways of improving data quality. We use multiple-choice question answering as a testbed and run a randomized trial by assigning crowdworkers to write questions under one of four different data collection protocols. We find that asking workers to write explanations for their examples is an ineffective stand-alone strategy for boosting NLU example difficulty. However, we find that training crowdworkers, and then using an iterative process of collecting data, sending feedback, and qualifying workers based on expert judgments is an effective means of collecting challenging data. But using crowdsourced, instead of expert judgments, to qualify workers and send feedback does not prove to be effective. We observe that the data from the iterative protocol with expert assessments is more challenging by several measures. Notably, the human--model gap on the unanimous agreement portion of this data is, on average, twice as large as the gap for the baseline protocol data.",

For sufficiently small obstacle densities, Taylor scaling dominates the linear-scaling that results from purely energetic considerations and, therefore, characterizes the dominant rate-limiting mechanism in that regime.",

Our model implements a partial loss function that enables dense tree semantic labeling outcomes from non-dense training samples, and a distance regression complementary task that enforces tree crown boundary constraints and substantially improves the model performance. Our multi-task architecture uses a shared backbone network that learns common representations for both tasks and two task-specific decoders, one for the semantic segmentation output and one for the distance map regression. We report that introducing the complementary task boosts the semantic segmentation performance compared to the single-task counterpart in up to 10% reaching an overall F1 score of 87.5% and an overall accuracy of 85.9%, achieving state-of-art performance for tree species classification in tropical forests.",

In this context, two fundamental geometric quantities play complementary roles: the Fubini-Study metric, which introduces a notion of distance between quantum states defined over a parameter space, and the Berry curvature associated with Berry-phase effects and topological band structures. In fact, recent studies have revealed direct relations between these two important quantities, suggesting that topological properties can, in special cases, be deduced from the quantum metric. In this work, we establish general and exact relations between the quantum metric and the topological invariants of generic Dirac Hamiltonians. In particular, we demonstrate that topological indices (Chern numbers or winding numbers) are bounded by the quantum volume determined by the quantum metric. Our theoretical framework, which builds on the Clifford algebra of Dirac matrices, is applicable to topological insulators and semimetals of arbitrary spatial dimensions, with or without chiral symmetry. This work clarifies the role of the Fubini-Study metric in topological states of matter, suggesting unexplored topological responses and metrological applications in a broad class of quantum-engineered systems.",

The Askaryan effect describes radio-frequency (RF) radiation from high-energy cascades. When a UHE neutrino initiates a cascade, cascade properties are imprinted on the radiation. Thus, observed radiation properties must be used to reconstruct the UHE neutrino event. Analytic Askaryan models have three advantages when used for UHE neutrino reconstruction. First, when analytic models are matched to observed data, cascade properties may be calculated directly from single RF waveforms. Second, fully analytic models require no Monte Carlo simulation of cascade particle trajectories, minimizing computational intensity. Third, fully analytic models can be embedded in firmware to enhance the real-time sensitivity of detectors. We derive a fully analytic Askaryan model in the time-domain given the energy and geometry of the UHE neutrino-induced cascade. We compare the fully analytic model to a semi-analytic parameterization used commonly in NuRadioMC, a simulation being used to design IceCube-Gen2. We find correlation coefficients greater than 0.95 between the fully analytic and semi-analytic cases, and we find the total power in the signals agree to within 5%.",

However, they have yet to be widely adopted in high-stakes application domains, such as healthcare. One reason may be that existing approaches assume that the underlying mechanisms are static in the sense that they do not change over time or over different environments. In many real world systems, however, the mechanisms are subject to shifts across environments which may invalidate the static environment assumption. In this paper, we tackle the problem of environmental shifts under the framework of offline contextual bandits. We view the environmental shift problem through the lens of causality and propose multi-environment contextual bandits that allow for changes in the underlying mechanisms. We adopt the concept of invariance from the causality literature and introduce the notion of policy invariance. We argue that policy invariance is only relevant if unobserved confounders are present and show that, in that case, an optimal invariant policy is guaranteed, under certain assumptions, to generalize across environments. Our results do not only provide a solution to the environmental shift problem but also establish concrete connections among causality, invariance and contextual bandits.",

        "abstract": "Reaction-diffusion models are common in many areas of statistical physics, where they describe the universal late-time dynamics of chemical reactions. Using a Bose gas representation, which maps the real-time dynamics of the reactants to the imaginary-time evolution of an interacting Bose gas, we consider corrections to the late-time scaling above the upper critical dimension, where mean-field theory sets the leading order. We establish that the leading corrections are not given by a small renormalization of the reaction rate due to memory effects, but instead set by higher-order correlation functions that capture memory effects of sub-clusters of reactants. Drawing on methods developed for ultracold quantum gases and nuclear physics, we compute these corrections exactly for various $k$-particle annihilation processes $k A \\to \\emptyset$ with $k>2$.",

Given a dg manifold, we prove that a `formal exponential map' exists if and only if the Atiyah class vanishes. Inspired by Kapranov's construction of a homotopy Lie algebra associated with the holomorphic tangent bundle of a complex manifold, we prove that the space of vector fields on a dg manifold admits an $L_\\infty[1]$ algebra structure, unique up to isomorphism, whose unary bracket is the Lie derivative w.r.t. the homological vector field, whose binary bracket is a 1-cocycle representative of the Atiyah class, and whose higher multibrackets can be computed by a recursive formula. For the dg manifold $(T_X^{0,1}[1],\\bar{\\partial})$ arising from a complex manifold $X$, we prove that this $L_\\infty[1]$ algebra structure is quasi-isomorphic to the standard $L_\\infty[1]$ algebra structure on the Dolbeault complex $\\Omega^{0,\\bullet}(T^{1,0}_X)$.",

We report on recent experimental results on proton acceleration from laser interaction with foil targets at ultra-relativistic intensities. We show a three-fold increase of the proton cut-off energy when a micrometer scale-length pre-plasma is introduced by irradiation with a low energy femtosecond pre-pulse. Our realistic numerical simulations agree with the observed gain of the proton cut-off energy and confirm the role of stochastic heating of fast electrons in the enhancement of the accelerating sheath field.",

Zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs), quasi one-dimensional semiconducting strips of graphene featuring two parallel zigzag edges along the main axis of the ribbon, are predicted to host intrinsic electronic edge states that are ferromagnetically ordered along the edges of the ribbon and antiferromagnetically coupled across its width. Despite recent advances in the bottom-up synthesis of atomically-precise ZGNRs, their unique electronic structure has thus far been obscured from direct observations by the innate chemical reactivity of spin-ordered edge states. Here we present a general technique for passivating the chemically highly reactive spin-polarized edge states by introducing a superlattice of substitutional nitrogen-dopants along the edges of a ZGNR. First-principles GW calculations and scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveal a giant spin splitting of the low-lying nitrogen lone-pair flat bands by a large exchange field (~850 Tesla) induced by the spin-polarized ferromagnetically ordered edges of ZGNRs. Our findings directly corroborate the nature of the predicted emergent magnetic order in ZGNRs and provide a robust platform for their exploration and functional integration into nanoscale sensing and logic devices.",

However, existing methods are limited to signals having an $n$-th Lipschitz derivative. Here, we introduce a general methodology to design $n$-th order predefined-time differentiators for a broader class of signals: for signals, whose $(n+1)$-th derivative is bounded by a function with bounded logarithmic derivative, i.e., whose $(n+1)$-th derivative grows at most exponentially. Our approach is based on a class of time-varying gains known as Time-Base Generators (\\textit{TBG}). The only assumption to construct the differentiator is that the class of signals to be differentiated $n$-times have a $(n+1)$-th derivative bounded by a known function with a known bound for its $(n+1)$-th logarithmic derivative. We show how our methodology achieves an \\textit{UBST} equal to the predefined time, better transient responses with smaller error peaks than autonomous predefined-time differentiators, and a \\textit{TBG} gain that is bounded at the settling time instant.",

        "abstract": "The exceptional combination of strength and ductility in multi-component alloys is often attributed to the interaction of dislocations with the various solute atoms in the alloy. To study these effects on the mechanical properties of such alloys there is a need to develop a modeling framework capable of quantifying the effect of these solutes on the evolution of dislocation networks. Large scale three-dimensional (3D) Discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations can provide access to such studies but to date no relevant approaches are available that aim for a complete representation of real alloys with arbitrary chemical compositions. Here, we introduce a formulation of dislocation interaction with substitutional solute atoms in fcc alloys in 3D DDD simulations that accounts for solute strengthening induced by atomic misfit as well as fluctuations in the cross-slip activation energy. Using this model, we show that local fluctuations in the chemical composition of various CrFeCoNi-based multi-principal element alloys (MPEA) lead to sluggish dislocation motion, frequent cross-slip and alignment of dislocations with solute aggregation features, explaining experimental observations related to mechanical behavior and dislocation activity. The developed method also provides a basis for further investigations of dislocation plasticity in any real arbitrary fcc alloy with substitutional solutes.",

To help discriminate between these models, using the vertex model for epithelial dynamics, we analysed the impact of where the constriction is applied on the final geometry of the active cell that is reducing its apical size. We find that medial activity, characterised by a reduction in the reference area in the vertex model, induces symmetry breaking and generates anisotropic cell shapes, while isotropic cell shapes and larger contractions occur when the reference perimeter in the model is reduced. When plasticity is included, sufficiently slow processes of medial contractile activity, compared with typical apical constriction pulses, can also achieve significant cell contraction. Finally, we apply the model to describe the active apical contractile pulses observed during cellular mitotic events within the epithelial enveloping cell layer in the developing annual killifish Austrolebias nigripinnis, being able to quantitatively describe the temporal evolution of cell shape changes when perimeter activity and area plasticity are included. A global fit of all parameters of the vertex model is provided.",

We use the concept of a negative effective mass and the resulting changes to the effective trapping potential and interaction strength to explain the time evolution of wave packets with weak repulsive interaction. In addition, the formation of stable wave packets with a negative effective mass is observed at the center of the BZ, and we interpret these as gap solitons in a periodically driven system.",

For the long-lived GRB central engine, the relativistical precessing jets will periodically inject kinetic energy into the external shocks, then significantly modulate the shapes of the light curves (LCs) in GRB afterglows. In this paper, we adopt the standard external shock model to investigate the effects of jet precession on GRB X-ray afterglows in cases with different parameters, i.e., the steady or time-dependent jet powers, precession periods, precession angles, and viewing angles. In the case where the jet powers are in steady or slow decay and the jet can sweep across the line of sight, shallow decay (or plateau) segments should appear; otherwise, a giant bump will emerge in the GRB afterglow LCs. We show that jet precession is a new plausible mechanism of the energy injection in GRBs. Moreover, some observed X-ray transients without GRB associations might be powered by the precessing jets.",

The {\\em weighting vector} is a closely-related concept that captures, in a nontrivial way, much of the underlying geometry of the original metric space. Recent work has demonstrated that when the metric space is Euclidean, the weighting vector serves as an effective tool for boundary detection. We recast this result and show the weighting vector may be viewed as a solution to a kernelized SVM. As one consequence, we apply this new insight to the task of outlier detection, and we demonstrate performance that is competitive or exceeds performance of state-of-the-art techniques on benchmark data sets. Under mild assumptions, we show the weighting vector, which has computational cost of matrix inversion, can be efficiently approximated in linear time. We show how nearest neighbor methods can approximate solutions to the minimization problems defined by SVMs.",

The partial reconstruction obtained from the depthmaps is completed to a full reconstruction of the point cloud by sweeping section by section along one direction and encoding the points which were not contained in the two depthmaps. The main ingredient is a list-based encoding of the inner points (situated inside the feasible regions) by a novel arithmetic three dimensional context coding procedure that efficiently utilizes rotational invariances present in the input data.

We benchmark state-of-the-art models on our datasets and analyze characteristics associated with the data. To create a comprehensive benchmark, we also evaluate these models on widely-used conversation summarization datasets to establish strong baselines in this domain. Furthermore, we incorporate argument mining through graph construction to directly model the issues, viewpoints, and assertions present in a conversation and filter noisy input, showing comparable or improved results according to automatic and human evaluations.",

        "abstract": "The question of \"Justice\" still divides social research and moral philosophy. Several Theories of Justice and conceptual approaches compete here, and distributive justice remains a major societal controversy. From an evolutionary point of view, fair and just exchange can be nothing but \"equivalent\", and this makes \"strict\" reciprocity (merit, equity) the foundational principle of justice, both theoretically and empirically. But besides being just, justice must be effective, efficient, and communicable. Moral reasoning is a communicative strategy for resolving conflict, enhancing status, and maintaining cooperation, thereby making justice rather a social bargain and an optimization problem. Social psychology (intuitions, rules of thumb, self-bindings) can inform us when and why the two auxiliary principles equality and need are more likely to succeed than merit would. Nevertheless, both equality and need are governed by reciprocal considerations, and self-bindings help to interpret altruism as \"very generalized reciprocity\". The Meritocratic Principle can be implemented, and its controversy avoided, by concentrating on \"non-merit\", i.e., institutionally draining the wellsprings of undeserved incomes (economic rents). Avoiding or taxing away economic rents is an effective implementation of justice in liberal democracies. This would enable market economies to bring economic achievement and income much more in line, thus becoming more just.",

Each user is connected to a switch of the network via a link. All the links of the network generate bipartite Bell-state entangled states in each time-slot with certain probabilities, and each end node stores one qubit of the entanglement generated by the link. To create shared entanglements for a set of users, measurement operations are performed on qubits of link-level entanglements on a set of related links, and these operations are probabilistic in nature and are successful with certain probabilities. Requests arrive to the system seeking shared entanglements for different sets of users. Each request is for the creation of shared entanglements for a fixed set of users using link-level entanglements on a fixed set of links. Requests are processed according to First-Come-First-Served service discipline and unserved requests are stored in buffers. Once a request is selected for service, measurement operations are performed on qubits of link-level entanglements on related links to create a shared entanglement. For given set of request arrival rates and link-level entanglement generation rates, we obtain necessary conditions for the stability of queues of requests. In each time-slot, the scheduler has to schedule entanglement swapping operations for different sets of users to stabilize the network. Next, we propose a Max-Weight scheduling policy and show that this policy stabilizes the network for all feasible arrival rates. We also provide numerical results to support our analysis. The analysis of a single quantum switch that creates multipartite entanglements for different sets of users is a special case of our work.",

This work reports a novel wurtzite-structure polar magnetic metal, identified as AA'-stacked (Fe0.5Co0.5)5-xGeTe2, which exhibits a Neel-type skyrmion lattice as well as a Rashba-Edelstein effect at room temperature. Atomic resolution imaging of the structure reveals a structural transition as a function of Co-substitution, leading to the polar phase at 50% Co. This discovery reveals an unprecedented layered polar magnetic system for investigating intriguing spin topologies and ushers in a promising new framework for spintronics.",

No matter how much a system is secure, it will eventually fail without proper and continuous monitoring. No wonder that the cybersecurity market is expected to grow up to $170.4 billion in 2022. However, the majority of legacy industries do not invest in NSM implementation until it is too late due to the initial and operation cost and static unutilized resources. Thus, this paper proposes a novel dynamic Internet of things (IoT) architecture for an industrial NSM that features a low installation and operation cost, low power consumption, intelligent organization behavior, and environmentally friendly operation. As a case study, the system is implemented in a midrange oil a gas manufacture facility in the southern states with more than 300 machines and servers over three remote locations and a production plant that features a challenging atmosphere condition. The proposed system successfully shows a significant saving (>65%) in power consumption, acquires one-tenth the installation cost, develops an intelligent operation expert system tools as well as saves the environment from more than 500 mg of CO2 pollution per hour, promoting green IoT systems.",

Within the context of a spherically symmetric `bubble trap' potential, we study the evolution of the system from small filled spheres to hollow, large, thin shells via the tuning of trap parameters. We analyze the bubble trap spectrum and states, and track the distinct changes in spectra between radial and angular modes across the evolution. This separation of the excitation spectrum provides a basis for quantifying dimensional cross-over to quasi-2D physics at a given temperature. Using the spectral data, for a range of trap parameters, we compute the critical temperature for a fixed number of particles to form a BEC. For a set of initial temperatures, we also evaluate the change in temperature that would occur in adiabatic expansion from small filled sphere to large thin shell were the trap to be dynamically tuned. We show that the system cools during this expansion but that the decrease in critical temperature occurs more rapidly, thus resulting in depletion of any initial condensate. We contrast our spectral methods with standard semiclassical treatments, which we find must be used with caution in the thin-shell limit. With regards to interactions, using energetic considerations and corroborated through Bogoliubov treatments, we demonstrate that they would be less important for thin shells due to reduced density but vortex physics would become more predominant. Finally, we apply our treatments to traps that realistically model CAL experiments and borrow from the thermodynamic insights found in the idealized bubble case during adiabatic expansion.",

In our recent studies, we have shown that $Pleurotus$ oyster fungi generate electrical potential impulses in the form of spike events as a result of their exposure to environmental, mechanical and chemical triggers, demonstrating that it is possible to discern the nature of stimuli from the fungi electrical responses. Harnessing the power of fungi sensing and intelligent capabilities, we explored the communication protocols of fungi as reporters of human chemical secretions such as hormones, addressing the question if fungi can sense human signals. We exposed $Pleurotus$ oyster fungi to cortisol, directly applied to a surface of a hemp shavings substrate colonised by fungi, and recorded the electrical activity of fungi. The response of fungi to cortisol was also supplementary studied through the application of X-ray to identify changes in the fungi tissue, where receiving cortisol by the substrate can inhibit the flow of calcium and, in turn, reduce its physiological changes. This study could pave the way for future research on adaptive fungal wearables capable for detecting physiological states of humans and biosensors made of living fungi.",

This chiral state is realized through the production of entangled pairs of right-moving fermions and left-moving antifermions (or vice versa, depending on the orientation of the electric field). Here we show that the statistical Gibbs entropy associated with these pairs is equal to the entropy of entanglement between the right-moving particles and left-moving antiparticles. We then derive an asymptotic expansion for the entanglement entropy in terms of the cumulants of the multiplicity distribution of produced particles and explain how to re-sum this asymptotic expansion. Finally, we study the time dependence of the entanglement entropy in a specific time-dependent pulsed background electric field, the so-called \"Sauter pulse\", and illustrate how our re-summation method works in this specific case. We also find that short pulses (such as the ones created by high energy collisions) result in an approximately thermal distribution for the produced particles.",

We find that Quoref, HellaSwag, and MC-TACO are best suited for distinguishing among state-of-the-art models, while SNLI, MNLI, and CommitmentBank seem to be saturated for current strong models.

Consequently, we demonstrate that the seemingly incompatible objectives of fairness and high welfare can be achieved simultaneously via transfer payments, even for general valuations, when the welfare objective is NSW. On the other hand, we show that a similar result is impossible for utilitarian social welfare: any envy-freeable allocation that achieves a constant fraction of the optimal welfare requires non-negligible transfers. To complement this result we present algorithms that compute an envy-free allocation with a given target welfare and with bounded transfers.",

The questions that arise in multiple domains, such as physics, physiology, the strategic decision in uncertain environments with multiple agents, climatology, among many others, have roots in causality and reasoning. It became apparent that many real-world temporal observations are nonlinearly related to each other. While the number of observations can be as high as millions of points, the number of temporal samples can be minimal due to ethical or practical reasons, leading to the curse-of-dimensionality in large-scale systems. This paper proposes a novel method using kernel principal component analysis and pre-images to obtain nonlinear dependencies of multivariate time-series data. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art causal discovery methods when the observations are restricted by time and are nonlinearly related. Extensive simulations on both real-world and synthetic datasets with various topologies are provided to evaluate our proposed methods.",

In this paper, we review the efforts to obtain late cosmic acceleration from spontaneous symmetry breaking in the Universe at large scales. This phenomenon is best understood through Ginzburg-Landau theory of phase transitions which we briefly describe. Hereafter, we present elements of spontaneous symmetry breaking in relativistic field theory. We then discuss the \"symmetron\" scenario based upon symmetry breaking in the late Universe which is realized by using a specific form of conformal coupling. However, the model is faced with \"NO GO\" to late time acceleration due to local gravity constraints. We argue that the problem can be circumvented by using the massless $\\lambda \\phi^4$ theory coupled to massive neutrino matter. In this case, coupling builds up dynamically at late stages of evolution giving rise to $Z_2$ symmetry breaking; coupling vanishes at early times keeping $Z_2$ symmetry intact. As a result, the field picks a non-zero mass in the true ground state proportional to neutrino mass, thereby, with little adjustments, one can achieve late time acceleration in this framework.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles serving as aerial base stations (UAV-BSs) can be deployed to provide wireless connectivity to ground devices in events of increased network demand, points-of-failure in existing infrastructure, or disasters. However, it is challenging to conserve the energy of UAVs during prolonged coverage tasks, considering their limited on-board battery capacity. Reinforcement learning-based (RL) approaches have been previously used to improve energy utilization of multiple UAVs, however, a central cloud controller is assumed to have complete knowledge of the end-devices' locations, i.e., the controller periodically scans and sends updates for UAV decision-making. This assumption is impractical in dynamic network environments with mobile ground devices. To address this problem, we propose a decentralized Q-learning approach, where each UAV-BS is equipped with an autonomous agent that maximizes the connectivity to ground devices while improving its energy utilization. Experimental results show that the proposed design significantly outperforms the centralized approaches in jointly maximizing the number of connected ground devices and the energy utilization of the UAV-BSs.",

        "abstract": "Fog devices are beginning to play a key role in relaying data and services within the Internet-of-Things (IoT) ecosystem. These relays may be static or mobile, with the latter offering a new degree of freedom for performance improvement via careful relay mobility design. Besides that, power conservation has been a prevalent issue in IoT networks with devices being power-constrained, requiring optimal power-control mechanisms. In this paper, we consider a multi-tier fog-based IoT architecture where a mobile/static fog node acts as an amplify and forward relay that transmits received information from a sensor node to a higher hierarchically-placed static fog device, which offers some localized services. The outage probability of the presented scenario was efficiently minimized by jointly optimizing the mobility pattern and the transmit power of the fog relay. A closed-form analytical expression for the outage probability was derived. Furthermore, due to the intractability and non-convexity of the formulated problem, we applied an iterative algorithm based on the steepest descent method to arrive at a desirable objective. Simulations reveal that the outage probability was improved by 62.7% in the optimized-location fixed-power (OLFP) scheme, 79.3% in the optimized-power fixed-location (OPFL) scheme, and 94.2% in the optimized-location optimized-power (OLOP) scheme, as against the fixed-location and fixed-power (FLFP) scheme (i.e., without optimization). Lastly, we present an optimal relay selection strategy that chooses an appropriate relay node from randomly distributed relaying candidates.",

This approach relies on ground truth isolated sources, which precludes scaling to widely available mixture data and limits progress on open-domain tasks. The recent mixture invariant training (MixIT) method enables training on in-the wild data; however, it suffers from two outstanding problems. First, it produces models which tend to over-separate, producing more output sources than are present in the input. Second, the exponential computational complexity of the MixIT loss limits the number of feasible output sources. These problems interact: increasing the number of output sources exacerbates over-separation. In this paper we address both issues. To combat over-separation we introduce new losses: sparsity losses that favor fewer output sources and a covariance loss that discourages correlated outputs. We also experiment with a semantic classification loss by predicting weak class labels for each mixture. To extend MixIT to larger numbers of sources, we introduce an efficient approximation using a fast least-squares solution, projected onto the MixIT constraint set. Our experiments show that the proposed losses curtail over-separation and improve overall performance. The best performance is achieved using larger numbers of output sources, enabled by our efficient MixIT loss, combined with sparsity losses to prevent over-separation. On the FUSS test set, we achieve over 13 dB in multi-source SI-SNR improvement, while boosting single-source reconstruction SI-SNR by over 17 dB.",

As it currently stands, a major issue in applying GCNs to NLP is document representation. In this paper, we show that a GCN enriched document representation greatly improves the results seen in HotPotQA, even when using a trivial topology. Our model (gQA), performs admirably when compared to the current SOTA, and requires little to no preprocessing. In Shao et al. 2020, the authors suggest that graph networks are not necessary for good performance in multi-hop QA.

Our dataset contains content in high-resource (English, Hindi) and lower-resource (Bengali, Malayalam, Tamil) languages. We train our own embedding model using knowledge distillation and a high-quality \"teacher\" model in order to address the imbalance in embedding quality between the low- and high-resource languages in our dataset. We provide evaluations on the performance of our solution and compare with baselines and existing state-of-the-art multilingual embedding models, namely LASER and LaBSE.

It is important to design efficient charging algorithms to mitigate the negative impact of EV charging on the power grid. This paper investigates an EV charging scheduling problem to reduce the charging cost while shaving the peak charging load, under unknown future information about EVs, such as arrival time, departure time, and charging demand. First, we formulate an EV charging problem to minimize the electricity bill of the EV fleet and study the EV charging problem in an online setting without knowing future information. We develop an actor-critic learning-based smart charging algorithm (SCA) to schedule the EV charging against the uncertainties in EV charging behaviors. The SCA learns an optimal EV charging strategy with continuous charging actions instead of discrete approximation of charging. We further develop a more computationally efficient customized actor-critic learning charging algorithm (CALC) by reducing the state dimension and thus improving the computational efficiency. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed SCA can reduce EVs' expected cost by 24.03%, 21.49%, 13.80%, compared with the Eagerly Charging Algorithm, Online Charging Algorithm, RL-based Adaptive Energy Management Algorithm, respectively. CALC is more computationally efficient, and its performance is close to that of SCA with only a gap of 5.56% in the cost.",

        "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) constitute a broad set of proteins with few uniting and many diverging properties. IDPs-and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) interspersed between folded domains-are generally characterized as having no persistent tertiary structure; instead they interconvert between a large number of different and often expanded structures. IDPs and IDRs are involved in an enormously wide range of biological functions and reveal novel mechanisms of interactions, and while they defy the common structure-function paradigm of folded proteins, their structural preferences and dynamics are important for their function. We here discuss open questions in the field of IDPs and IDRs, focusing on areas where machine learning and other computational methods play a role. We discuss computational methods aimed to predict transiently formed local and long-range structure, including methods for integrative structural biology. We discuss the many different ways in which IDPs and IDRs can bind to other molecules, both via short linear motifs, as well as in the formation of larger dynamic complexes such as biomolecular condensates. We discuss how experiments are providing insight into such complexes and may enable more accurate predictions. Finally, we discuss the role of IDPs in disease and how new methods are needed to interpret the mechanistic effects of genomic variants in IDPs.",

Traditional approaches usually rely on dedicated sensors that are worn by the user or cameras that require line of sight. In this paper, we present fine-grained finger gesture recognition by using commodity WiFi without requiring user to wear any sensors. Our system takes advantages of the fine-grained Channel State Information available from commodity WiFi devices and the prevalence of WiFi network infrastructures. It senses and identifies subtle movements of finger gestures by examining the unique patterns exhibited in the detailed CSI. We devise environmental noise removal mechanism to mitigate the effect of signal dynamic due to the environment changes. Moreover, we propose to capture the intrinsic gesture behavior to deal with individual diversity and gesture inconsistency. Lastly, we utilize multiple WiFi links and larger bandwidth at 5GHz to achieve finger gesture recognition under multi-user scenario. Our experimental evaluation in different environments demonstrates that our system can achieve over 90% recognition accuracy and is robust to both environment changes and individual diversity. Results also show that our system can provide accurate gesture recognition under different scenarios.",

The paper describes the corresponding algorithm, provides a theoretical analysis, and demonstrates its utility in multiple scenarios. We argue that the proposed method addresses the current need for comprehensive assessment of prediction intervals and thus represents a valuable addition to the uncertainty quantification toolbox.",

        "abstract": "Voice biometrics is drawing increasing attention as it is a promising alternative to legacy passwords for user authentication. Recently, a growing body of work shows that voice biometrics is vulnerable to spoofing through replay attacks, where an adversary tries to spoof voice authentication systems by using a pre-recorded voice sample collected from a genuine user. To this end, we propose VoiceGesture, a liveness detection solution for voice authentication on smart devices such as smartphones and smart speakers. VoiceGesture detects a live user by leveraging both the unique articulatory gesture of the user when speaking a passphrase and the audio hardware advances on these smart devices. Specifically, our system re-uses a pair of built-in speaker and microphone on a smart device as a Doppler radar, which transmits a high-frequency acoustic sound from the speaker and listens to the reflections at the microphone when a user speaks a passphrase. Then we extract Doppler shifts resulted from the user's articulatory gestures for liveness detection. VoiceGesture is practical as it requires neither cumbersome operations nor additional hardware but a speaker and a microphone commonly available on smart devices that support voice input. Our experimental evaluation with 21 participants and different smart devices shows that VoiceGesture achieves over 99% and around 98% detection accuracy for text-dependent and text-independent liveness detection, respectively. Results also show that VoiceGesture is robust to different device placements, low audio sampling frequency, and supports medium range liveness detection on smart speakers in various use scenarios like smart homes and smart vehicles.",

Such a system can reuse existing WiFi devices in homes without the need for additional sensors. It uses WiFi signals to sense the physiological changes associated with fruit ripening for detecting the ripeness of fruit. FruitSense leverages the larger bandwidth at 5GHz (i.e., over 600MHz) to extract the multipath-independent signal components to characterize the physiological compounds of the fruit. It then measures the similarity between the extracted features and the ones in ripeness profiles for identifying the ripeness level. We evaluate FruitSense in different multipath environments with two types of fruits (i.e, kiwi and avocado) under four levels of ripeness. Experimental results show that FruitSense can detect the ripeness levels of fruits with an accuracy of over 90%.",

These results are a natural extension of the girth results of the already-studied cases of column weight 2 and 3, and it is based on the connection between the girth of a Tanner graph given by a parity-check matrix and the properties of powers of the product between the matrix and its transpose. The girth conditions can be easily incorporated into fast algorithms that construct codes of desired girth between 6 and 12; our own algorithms are presented for each girth, together with constructions obtained from them and corresponding computer simulations. More importantly, this paper emphasizes how the girth conditions of the Tanner graph corresponding to a parity-check matrix composed of circulants relate to the matrix obtained by adding (over the integers) the circulant columns of the parity-check matrix. In particular, we show that imposing girth conditions on a parity-check matrix is equivalent to imposing conditions on a square circulant submatrix of size 4 obtained from it.",

After the discovery of the Higgs particle at CERN, which essentially completed the SM, an amazing interrelation of the leading interaction strengths of the gauge bosons, the top-quark and the Higgs boson showed up amounting that the SM allows for a perturbative extrapolation of the running couplings up to the Planck scale. The central question concerns the stability of the electroweak vacuum, which requires that the running Higgs self-coupling stays positive. Although several evaluations seem to favor the meta-stability within the experimental and theoretical parameter-uncertainties, one should not exclude the possibility that other experiments and improved matching conditions will be able to establish the absolute stability of the SM vacuum in the future. I will discuss the stable vacuum scenario and its impact on early cosmology, revealing the Higgs boson as the inflaton. It turns out that the Standard Model's presumed \"hierarchy problem\" and similarly the \"cosmological constant problem\" resolve themselves when we understand the SM as a low energy effective tail that is emergent from a cutoff-medium at the Planck scale. \"The Infrared - Ultraviolet Connection\" conveyed by the Higgs boson mass renormalization appears in a new light when the energy dependence of the SM couplings is taken into account. The bare Higgs boson mass square then changes sign below the Planck scale where it is activating the Higgs mechanism.",

We have tested the proposed method using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model of a coronal loop in an active region. The LTRAC method enables modeling of the transition region with the numerical grid size of 50--100 km, which is about 1000 times larger than the physically required value. We used the velocity differential emission measure to evaluate the possible effects on the optically thin emission. Lower temperature emissions were better reproduced by the LTRAC method than by previous methods. Doppler shift and non-thermal width of the synthesized line emission agree with those from a high-resolution reference simulation within an error of several km/s above the formation temperature of $10^5$ K.",

The basic idea is to identify and extract the signal reflection corresponding to each individual user with the help of multiple WiFi links and all the available WiFi channels at 5GHz. Given the extracted signal reflection of each user, MultiTrack examines the path of the reflected signals at multiple links to simultaneously track multiple users. It further reconstructs the signal profile of each user as if only a single user has performed activity in the environment to facilitate multi-user activity recognition. We evaluate MultiTrack in different multipath environments with up to 4 users for multi-user tracking and up to 3 users for activity recognition. Experimental results show that our system can achieve decimeter localization accuracy and over 92% activity recognition accuracy under multi-user scenarios.",

The $^3P_0$ quark-antiquark creation mechanism is assumed to account for the transition coupling between three- and five-quark components in proton, and the corresponding transition coupling strength is fixed by fitting the intrinsic sea flavor asymmetry $\\bar{d}-\\bar{u}$ data for proton. Accordingly, with all the parameters fixed by empirical values, the probabilities of the intrinsic five-quark Fock components in proton wave function should be $\\sim30 - 50\\%$, which lead to the numerical results for quark spin $\\Delta u$, $\\Delta d$ and $\\Delta s$, as well the axial charges of proton consistent with the experimental data and predictions by other theoretical approaches.",

Current efforts to discover and design new materials in this class generally rely on substitutional doping of known ferroelectrics, as slight changes to local compositional order can significantly affect the Curie temperature, morphotropic phase boundary, and electromechanical responses. In this work, we demonstrate that moving to the strong limit of compositional complexity in an ABO3 perovskite allows stabilization of novel relaxor responses that do not rely on a single narrow phase transition region. Entropy-assisted synthesis approaches are used to create single crystal Ba(Ti0.2Sn0.2Zr0.2Hf0.2Nb0.2)O3 [Ba(5B)O] films. The high levels of configurational disorder present in this system is found to influence dielectric relaxation, phase transitions, nano-polar domain formation, and Curie temperature. Temperature-dependent dielectric, Raman spectroscopy and second-harmonic generation measurements reveal multiple phase transitions, a high Curie temperature of 570 K, and the relaxor ferroelectric nature of Ba(5B)O films. The first principles theory calculations are used to predict possible combinations of cations to quantify the relative feasibility of formation of highly disordered single-phase perovskite systems. The ability to stabilize single-phase perovskites with such a large number of different cations on the B-sites offers new possibilities for designing high-performance materials for piezoelectric, pyroelectric and tunable dielectric applications.",

Specifically, we study photon statistics, one-mode and two-mode squeezing, and entanglement generation when the localized state is excited with squeezed light. These quantum properties inherit the shape of the localized state but, more interestingly, and unlike in the topologically trivial case, we find that propagation of squeezed light in a topologically protected state robustly preserves the phase of the squeezed quadrature as the system evolves.

Innovations in printing technologies are required to promote the broad application of high-performance PSEs at a low cost. However, current printing techniques are still facing long-lasting challenges in addressing the conflict between printing speed and performance. To overcome this challenge, we developed a new corona-enabled electrostatic printing (CEP) technique for ultra-fast (milliseconds) roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing of binder-free multifunctional e-skins. The printing capability and controllability of CEP were investigated through parametric studies and microstructure observation. The electric field generation, material transfer, and particle amount and size selecting mechanisms were numerically and experimentally studied. CEP printed graphene e-skins were demonstrated to possess outstanding strain sensing performance. The binder-free feature of the CEP-assembled networks enables them to provide pressure sensitivity as low as 2.5 Pa, and capability to detect acoustic signals of hundreds of hertz in frequency. Furthermore, the CEP technique was utilized to pattern different types of functional materials (e.g., graphene and thermochromic polymers) onto different substrates (e.g., tape and textile). Overall, this study demonstrated that CEP can be a novel contactless and ultrafast manufacturing platform compatible with R2R process for fabricating high-performance, scalable, and low-cost soft electronics.",

However, despite ADC's intuitive appeal, it remains unclear when training on adversarial datasets produces more robust models. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale controlled study focused on question answering, assigning workers at random to compose questions either (i) adversarially (with a model in the loop); or (ii) in the standard fashion (without a model). Across a variety of models and datasets, we find that models trained on adversarial data usually perform better on other adversarial datasets but worse on a diverse collection of out-of-domain evaluation sets. Finally, we provide a qualitative analysis of adversarial (vs standard) data, identifying key differences and offering guidance for future research.",

It constitutes a considerable part of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) which has led to the introduction of a special research topic on Conversational Question Answering (CQA), wherein a system is required to understand the given context and then engages in multi-turn QA to satisfy the user's information needs. Whilst the focus of most of the existing research work is subjected to single-turn QA, the field of multi-turn QA has recently grasped attention and prominence owing to the availability of large-scale, multi-turn QA datasets and the development of pre-trained language models. With a good amount of models and research papers adding to the literature every year recently, there is a dire need of arranging and presenting the related work in a unified manner to streamline future research. This survey, therefore, is an effort to present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research trends of CQA primarily based on reviewed papers from 2016-2021. Our findings show that there has been a trend shift from single-turn to multi-turn QA which empowers the field of Conversational AI from different perspectives. This survey is intended to provide an epitome for the research community with the hope of laying a strong foundation for the field of CQA.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the complexity of explicit construction problems, where the goal is to produce a particular object of size $n$ possessing some pseudorandom property in time polynomial in $n$. We give overwhelming evidence that ${\\bf APEPP}$, defined originally by Kleinberg et al., is the natural complexity class associated with explicit constructions for objects whose existence follows from the probabilistic method, by proving that a host of well-studied explicit construction problems lie in this class. We then observe that a result of Je\u0159\u00e1bek on provability in Bounded Arithmetic, when reinterpreted as a reduction between search problems, shows that constructing a truth table of high circuit complexity is complete for ${\\bf APEPP}$ under ${\\bf P}^{\\bf NP}$ reductions. This demonstrates that constructing a hard truth table is a universal explicit construction problem in a concrete sense. This result in fact gives a precise algorithmic characterization of proving $2^{\\Omega(n)}$ circuit lower bounds for ${\\bf E}^{\\bf NP}$: the complete problem for ${\\bf APEPP}$ has a ${\\bf P}^{\\bf NP}$ algorithm if and only if such a lower bound holds. Together with our proof that pseudorandom generators can be constructed in ${\\bf APEPP}$, this also yields a self-contained and significantly simplified proof of the celebrated result of Impagliazzo and Wigderson that worst-case-hard truth tables can be used to derandomize algorithms (although the conclusion is weaker as our derandomization requires an ${\\bf NP}$ oracle). As another corollary of this completeness result, we show that ${\\bf E}^{\\bf NP}$ contains a language of circuit complexity $2^{\\Omega(n)}$ if and only if it contains a language of circuit complexity $\\frac{2^n}{3n}$. Finally, for several of the problems shown to lie in ${\\bf APEPP}$, we demonstrate direct polynomial time reductions to the explicit construction of hard truth tables.",

However, a limitation arises. A simple comparison of buried object brightness values does not disentangle the effects of the GPR system itself from the system's operating environment and the objects being observed. Therefore, with brightness values exhibiting an unknown synthesis of systemic, environmental, and object factors, GPR system analysis becomes a convoluted affair. In this work, we use an experimentally collected dataset of over 25,000 object observations from five different multi-static radar arrays to develop models of buried object brightness and control for these various effects. Our modeling efforts provide a means for quantifying the relative brightness of GPR systems, the objects they detect, and the physical properties of those objects which influence observed brightness. To evaluate the models' performance on new object observations, we repeatedly simulate fitting them to half the dataset and predicting the observed brightness values of the unseen half. Additionally, we introduce a method for estimating the probability that individual observations constitute a visible object, which aids in failure analysis, performance characterization, and dataset cleaning.",

Categorical modularity is a graph modularity metric based on the $k$-nearest neighbor graph constructed with embedding vectors of words from a fixed set of semantic categories, in which the goal is to measure the proportion of words that have nearest neighbors within the same categories. We use a core set of 500 words belonging to 59 neurobiologically motivated semantic categories in 29 languages and analyze three word embedding models per language (FastText, MUSE, and subs2vec). We find moderate to strong positive correlations between categorical modularity and performance on the monolingual tasks of sentiment analysis and word similarity calculation and on the cross-lingual task of bilingual lexicon induction both to and from English. Overall, we suggest that categorical modularity provides non-trivial predictive information about downstream task performance, with breakdowns of correlations by model suggesting some meta-predictive properties about semantic information loss as well.",

Nevertheless, most of the current convolution neural network approaches lack the ability to deal with the challenges such as size and rotation variations. To address these problems, we propose the rotation equivariant feature image pyramid network (REFIPN), an image pyramid network based on rotation equivariance convolution. The proposed pyramid network extracts features in a wide range of scales and orientations by using novel convolution filters. These features are used to generate vector fields and determine the weight and angle of the highest-scoring orientation for all spatial locations on an image. Finally, the extracted features go through the prediction layers of the detector. The detection performance of the proposed model is validated on two commonly used aerial benchmarks and the results show our propose model can achieve state-of-the-art performance with satisfactory efficiency.",

By using randomized neural networks, we study distributed classification, which can be employed in situations were data cannot be stored at a central location nor shared. We propose a more efficient solution for distributed classification by making use of a lossy compression approach applied when sharing the local classifiers with other agents. This approach originates from the framework of hyperdimensional computing, and is adapted herein. The results of experiments on a collection of datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach has usually higher accuracy than local classifiers and getting close to the benchmark - the centralized classifier. This work can be considered as the first step towards analyzing the variegated horizon of distributed randomized neural networks.",

To develop a better deep model for blood glucose forecasting, we analyze the data and detect important patterns. These observations helped us to propose a method that has several key advantages over existing methods: 1- it learns a personalized model for each patient as well as a global model; 2- it uses an attention mechanism and extracted time features to better learn long-term dependencies in the data; 3- it introduces a new, robust training procedure for time series data.

We show that Chow-Liu initialization in CLRG greatly reduces the sample complexity of RG from being exponential in the diameter of the tree to only logarithmic in the diameter for the hidden Markov model (HMM). Second, we robustify RG, CLRG, Neighbor Joining (NJ) and Spectral NJ (SNJ) by using the truncated inner product. These robustified algorithms can tolerate a number of corruptions up to the square root of the number of clean samples. Finally, we derive the first known instance-dependent impossibility result for structure learning of latent trees.

We model this task as a discrete optimization problem with partial Wasserstein divergence as an objective function. Although this problem is NP-hard, we prove that it has the submodular property, allowing us to use a greedy algorithm with a 0.63 approximation. However, the greedy algorithm is still inefficient because it requires linear programming for each objective function evaluation. To overcome this difficulty, we propose quasi-greedy algorithms for acceleration, which consist of a series of techniques such as sensitivity analysis based on strong duality and the so-called $C$-transform in the optimal transport field. Experimentally, we demonstrate that we can efficiently make two datasets similar in terms of partial Wasserstein divergence, including driving scene datasets.",

However, the way of taking one sentence as input prevents the modeling of non-sequential global context, which is useful especially when local context information is limited or ambiguous. To this end, we propose a model called Global Context enhanced Document-level NER (GCDoc) to leverage global contextual information from two levels, i.e., both word and sentence. At word-level, a document graph is constructed to model a wider range of dependencies between words, then obtain an enriched contextual representation for each word via graph neural networks (GNN). To avoid the interference of noise information, we further propose two strategies. First we apply the epistemic uncertainty theory to find out tokens whose representations are less reliable, thereby helping prune the document graph. Then a selective auxiliary classifier is proposed to effectively learn the weight of edges in document graph and reduce the importance of noisy neighbour nodes. At sentence-level, for appropriately modeling wider context beyond single sentence, we employ a cross-sentence module which encodes adjacent sentences and fuses it with the current sentence representation via attention and gating mechanisms. Extensive experiments on two benchmark NER datasets (CoNLL 2003 and Ontonotes 5.0 English dataset) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. Our model reaches F1 score of 92.22 (93.40 with BERT) on CoNLL 2003 dataset and 88.32 (90.49 with BERT) on Ontonotes 5.0 dataset, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.",

Accurate quantification of out-of-station waiting time is important to evaluating the social benefit and cost of service scheduling/optimization plans; however, out-of-station waiting time is difficult to estimate because it is not a part of smart card transactions. In this study, we propose an innovative method to estimate the out-of-station waiting time by leveraging the information from a small group of transfer passengers -- those who transfer from nearby bus routes to the metro station. Based on the estimated transfer time for this small group, we first infer the out-of-station waiting time for all passengers by developing a Gaussian Process regression with a Student-$t$ likelihood and then use the estimated out-of-station waiting time to build queueing diagrams. We apply our method to the Tiantongyuan North station of Beijing metro as a case study; our results show that the maximum out-of-station waiting time can reach 15 minutes, and the maximum queue length can be over 3000 passengers. Our results suggest that out-of-station waiting can cause significant travel costs and thus should be considered in analyzing transit performance, mode choice, and social benefits. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first quantitative study for out-of-station waiting time.",

Firstly, we decouple the optimization problem and design the active beamforming for a given IRS configuration. Then we transform the optimization problem of the IRS-based passive beamforming design into a tractable non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). For solving the transformed problem, we give an approximate solution based on the technique of widely used semidefinite relaxation (SDR). We also propose a low-complexity iterative solution. We further prove that it can converge to a locally optimal value. Finally, considering the practical scenario of discrete phase shifts at the IRS, we give the quantization design for IRS elements on basis of the two solutions. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solutions over the relevant benchmarks.",

Training DRL agents with diverse dialogue trajectories prepare them well for rare user requests and unseen situations. One effective diversification method is to let the agent interact with a diverse set of learned user models. However, trajectories created by these artificial user models may contain generation errors, which can quickly propagate into the agent's policy. It is thus important to control the quality of the diversification and resist the noise. In this paper, we propose a novel dialogue diversification method for task-oriented dialogue systems trained in simulators. Our method, Intermittent Short Extension Ensemble (I-SEE), constrains the intensity to interact with an ensemble of diverse user models and effectively controls the quality of the diversification. Evaluations on the Multiwoz dataset show that I-SEE successfully boosts the performance of several state-of-the-art DRL dialogue agents.",

For the intermolecular potential, the Kihara model of a rod-shape core with zero diameter was used. For theoretical consistency, however, the lattice constant should be determined by a pressure-constant MC simulation, i.e. by the NPT simulation. It was anticipated that the NPT simulation, successful for monoatomic molecular fluids, might not work straightforwardly for solid CO2 because of the non-spherical molecular shape and interactions. In fact, it was found in the present work that the protocol of the standard NPT simulation had to be modified for solid CO2 to achieve an equilibrium lattice constant, given an external pressure, within practical computer time and capacity. The modified protocol was used to calculate the P-V relation at 1 bar and from 2 to 10 GPa at which a structural phase transition is known to take place. The temperature was fixed at 200 K. As a result, the calculated P-V relation was similar to those in previous theoretical works, the molar volume being roughly 0.5 % smaller than experimental data.",

Specifically, the evolution of the robots' density is modelled by mean-field partial differential equations (PDEs) which are uniquely determined by the robots' individual dynamics. Bayesian regression models are used to obtain predictions and return a variance function that represents the confidence of the prediction. We formulate a PDE constrained optimization problem based on this variance function to dynamically generate a reference density signal which guides the robots to uncertain areas to collect new data, and design mean-field feedback-based control laws such that the robots' density converges to this reference signal. We also show that the proposed feedback law is robust to density estimation errors in the sense of input-to-state stability. Simulations are included to verify the effectiveness of the algorithms.",

Under the constraints that the probabilities that the length of the test, a stopping time, exceeds $n$ are bounded by a certain threshold $\\epsilon$, we obtain certain fundamental limits on the asymptotic behavior of the sequential test as $n$ tends to infinity. Assuming that $\\Gamma$ is a convex and compact set, we obtain the set of all first-order error exponents for the problem. We also prove a strong converse. Additionally, we obtain the set of second-order error exponents under the assumption that $\\mathcal{X}$ is a finite alphabet. In the proof of second-order asymptotics, a main technical contribution is the derivation of a central limit-type result for a maximum of an uncountable set of log-likelihood ratios under suitable conditions. This result may be of independent interest. We also show that some important statistical models satisfy the conditions.",

Our main contributions include: i) reforming the best response (BR) policy network in NFSP to be a mapping from action-state pair to action-value, to make the calculation of BR possible in NSGs; ii) converting the average policy network of an NFSP agent into a metric-based classifier, helping the agent to assign distributions only on legal actions rather than all actions; iii) enabling NFSP with high-level actions, which can benefit training efficiency and stability in NSGs; and iv) leveraging information contained in graphs of NSGs by learning efficient graph node embeddings.

For trajectory planning, it is computationally expensive to plan trajectories for such hybrid dynamical systems as it usually requires planning for discrete modes separately. In this work, we formulate the belt drive unit assembly task as a trajectory optimization problem with complementarity constraints to avoid explicitly imposing contact mode sequences. The problem is solved as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC) to obtain feasible and efficient assembly trajectories.

Recently, there has been an increasing amount of literature that employs mean-field partial differential equations (PDEs) to model the time-evolution of the probability density of swarm robotic systems and uses mean-field feedback to design stable control laws that act on individuals such that their density converges to a target profile. However, it remains largely unexplored considering problems of how to estimate the mean-field density, how the density estimation algorithms affect the control performance, and whether the estimation performance in turn depends on the control algorithms. In this work, we focus on studying the interplay of these algorithms. Specially, we propose new mean-field control laws which use the real-time density and its gradient as feedback, and prove that they are globally input-to-state stable (ISS) to estimation errors. Then, we design filtering algorithms to obtain estimates of the density and its gradient, and prove that these estimates are convergent assuming the control laws are known. Finally, we show that the feedback interconnection of these estimation and control algorithms is still globally ISS, which is attributed to the bilinearity of the mean-field PDE system. An agent-based simulation is included to verify the stability of these algorithms and their feedback interconnection.",

        "abstract": "Even though many scalar field models of dark energy have been considered in the literature, there is another interesting class of dark energy models involving a fluid known as a Chaplygin gas. In addition to describing the dark energy, both scalar-tensor model and the Chaplygin gas model are suitable candidates for explaining the spherical cosmological collapse. One of the most well-known scalar field models is the quintessence model, which was first introduced to explain an accelerating expanding universe. Using a special form of the quintessence model that is equivalent to Chaplygin gas, we describe evolution of a spherical collapse. We study the cosmological properties of the quintessence field with a special potential. In addition to the quintessence model, that can be converted into a Chaplygin gas model in a particular case, we claim that the fixed-potential tachyonic model is equivalent to the Chaplygin gas model. In this work, we obtain the spherical collapse parameters: the virialized overdensity parameters, radius, the energy density at the turnaround moment, etc. We compare the results of the proposed model with the standard model of cosmology and the Einstein-de Sitter model. We show that the formation of the large-scale structures within the framework of a Chaplygin gas model happens earlier than predicted in the standard model.",

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned about a learning algorithm for a probabilistic model of spiking neural networks (SNNs). Jimenez Rezende & Gerstner (2014) proposed a stochastic variational inference algorithm to train SNNs with hidden neurons. The algorithm updates the variational distribution using the score function gradient estimator, whose high variance often impedes the whole learning algorithm. This paper presents an alternative gradient estimator for SNNs based on the path-wise gradient estimator. The main technical difficulty is a lack of a general method to differentiate a realization of an arbitrary point process, which is necessary to derive the path-wise gradient estimator. We develop a differentiable point process, which is the technical highlight of this paper, and apply it to derive the path-wise gradient estimator for SNNs. We investigate the effectiveness of our gradient estimator through numerical simulation.",

In such systems, the most likely outcome is given by a Nash equilibrium. In many practical settings, only game equilibria are observed, while the optimal parameters for a game model are unknown. This work introduces Nash Fixed Point Networks (N-FPNs), a class of implicit-depth neural networks that output Nash equilibria of contextual games. The N-FPN architecture fuses data-driven modeling with provided constraints. Given equilibrium observations of a contextual game, N-FPN parameters are learnt to predict equilibria outcomes given only the context. We present an end-to-end training scheme for N-FPNs that is simple and memory efficient to implement with existing autodifferentiation tools. N-FPNs also exploit a novel constraint decoupling scheme to avoid costly projections. Provided numerical examples show the efficacy of N-FPNs on atomic and non-atomic games (e.g. traffic routing).",

It is interesting and useful to achieve coexistence of intrinsic piezoelectricity, ferromagnetism and nontrivial band topology in single two-dimensional (2D) material, namely 2D piezoelectric quantum anomalous hall insulator (PQAHI). In this work, 2D Janus monolayer $\\mathrm{Li_2Fe_2SSe}$ is predict to be a room-temperature PQAHI, which possesses dynamic, mechanical and thermal stabilities. It is predicted to be a half Dirac semimetal without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It is found that the inclusion of SOC opens up a large nontrivial gap, which means the nontrivial bulk topology (QAH insulator), confirmed by the calculation of Berry curvature and the presence of two chiral edge states (Chern number C=2). Calculated results show that monolayer $\\mathrm{Li_2Fe_2SSe}$ possesses robust QAH states against biaxial strain and electronic correlations. Compared to LiFeX, the glide mirror $G_z$ of $\\mathrm{Li_2Fe_2SSe}$ disappears, which will induce only out-of-plane piezoelectric response. The calculated out-of-plane $d_{31}$ of monolayer $\\mathrm{Li_2Fe_2SSe}$ is -0.238 pm/V comparable with ones of other 2D known materials. Moreover, very high Curie temperature (about 1000 K) is predicted by using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which means that the QAH effect can be achieved at room temperature in Janus monolayer $\\mathrm{Li_2Fe_2SSe}$. Similar to monolayer $\\mathrm{Li_2Fe_2SSe}$, the PQAHI can also be realized in the Janus monolayer $\\mathrm{Li_2Fe_2SeTe}$.",

Based on this framework, we devised a Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), which explored both morphological and spatial information. The proposed TransMIL can effectively deal with unbalanced/balanced and binary/multiple classification with great visualization and interpretability. We conducted various experiments for three different computational pathology problems and achieved better performance and faster convergence compared with state-of-the-art methods. The test AUC for the binary tumor classification can be up to 93.09% over CAMELYON16 dataset.

In this paper we introduce a new family of dense subgraph objectives, parameterized by a single parameter $p$, based on computing generalized means of degree sequences of a subgraph. Our objective captures both the standard densest subgraph problem and the maximum $k$-core as special cases, and provides a way to interpolate between and extrapolate beyond these two objectives when searching for other notions of dense subgraphs. In terms of algorithmic contributions, we first show that our objective can be minimized in polynomial time for all $p \\geq 1$ using repeated submodular minimization. A major contribution of our work is analyzing the performance of different types of peeling algorithms for dense subgraphs both in theory and practice. We prove that the standard peeling algorithm can perform arbitrarily poorly on our generalized objective, but we then design a more sophisticated peeling method which for $p \\geq 1$ has an approximation guarantee that is always at least $1/2$ and converges to 1 as $p \\rightarrow \\infty$. In practice, we show that this algorithm obtains extremely good approximations to the optimal solution, scales to large graphs, and highlights a range of different meaningful notions of density on graphs coming from numerous domains. Furthermore, it is typically able to approximate the densest subgraph problem better than the standard peeling algorithm, by better accounting for how the removal of one node affects other nodes in its neighborhood.",

A control law is developed by using both techniques sequentially in the context of feedback linearization. The concurrent learning algorithm estimates the system parameters of structured uncertainty without requiring persistent excitation, which are used in the design of the feedback linearization law. Then, a non-parametric Gaussian Process learns unstructured uncertainty. The closed-loop system stability for the nth-order system is proven using the Lyapunov stability theorem. The simulation results show that the tracking error is minimized (i) when true values of model parameters have not been provided, (ii) in the presence of disturbances introduced once the parameters have converged to their true values and (iii) when system parameters have not converged to their true values in the presence of disturbances.",

        "abstract": "In the classical Bonus-Malus System (BMS) in automobile insurance, the premium for the next year is adjusted according to the policyholder's claim history (particularly frequency) in the previous year. Some variations of the classical BMS have been considered by taking more of driver's claim experience into account to better assess individual's risk. Nevertheless, we note that in practice it is common for a BMS to adopt transition rules according to the claim history for the past multiple years in countries such as Belgium, Italy, Korea, and Singapore. In this paper, we revisit a modified BMS which was briefly introduced in Lemaire (1995) and Pitrebois et al. (2003a). Specifically, such a BMS extends the number of Bonus-Malus (BM) levels due to an additional component in the transition rules representing the number of consecutive claim-free years. With the extended BM levels granting more reasonable bonus to careful drivers, this paper investigates the transition rules in a more rigorous manner, and provides the optimal BM relativities under various statistical model assumptions including the frequency random effect model and the dependent collective risk model. Also, numerical analysis of a real data set is provided to compare the classical BMS and our proposed BMS.",

To this end, the key is how to obtain the shape grammars from 2D images accurately and efficiently. Although enjoying the merits of promising results on the semantic parsing, deep learning methods cannot directly make use of the architectural rules, which play an important role for man-made structures. In this paper, we present a novel translational symmetry-based approach to improving the deep neural networks. Our method employs deep learning models as the base parser, and a module taking advantage of translational symmetry is used to refine the initial parsing results. In contrast to conventional semantic segmentation or bounding box prediction, we propose a novel scheme to fuse segmentation with anchor-free detection in a single stage network, which enables the efficient training and better convergence. After parsing the facades into shape grammars, we employ an off-the-shelf rendering engine like Blender to reconstruct the realistic high-quality 3D models using procedural modeling. We conduct experiments on three public datasets, where our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we have illustrated the 3D building models built from 2D facade images.",

In addition, we develop a unified procedure for variable selection to identify significant covariates under a double penalization framework, and we show that the penalized estimators enjoy the \"oracle\" property. The proposed method can simultaneously identify non-zero spatially distributed covariates and solve the problem of \"leakage\" across complex domains of the functional spatial component. To estimate the standard deviations of the proposed estimators for the coefficients, a sandwich formula is developed as well. In the end, Monte Carlo simulation examples and a real data example are provided to illustrate the proposed methodology. All technical proofs are given in the supplementary materials.",

The presence of lesion changes on serial imaging can have significant impact on clinical decision making, highlighting the important role for automated change detection. Lesion changes can represent anomalies in serial imaging, which implies a limited availability of annotations and a wide variety of possible changes that need to be considered. Hence, we introduce a new unsupervised anomaly detection and localisation method trained exclusively with serial images that do not contain any lesion changes. Our training automatically synthesises lesion changes in serial images, introducing detection and localisation pseudo-labels that are used to self-supervise the training of our model. Given the rarity of these lesion changes in the synthesised images, we train the model with the imbalance robust focal Tversky loss. When compared to supervised models trained on different datasets, our method shows competitive performance in the detection and localisation of new demyelinating lesions on longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging in multiple sclerosis patients.

This paper presents empirical results with eleven prominent off-policy learning algorithms that use linear function approximation: five Gradient-TD methods, two Emphatic-TD methods, Off-policy TD($\\lambda$), Vtrace, and versions of Tree Backup and ABQ modified to apply to a prediction setting. Our experiments used the Collision task, a small idealized off-policy problem analogous to that of an autonomous car trying to predict whether it will collide with an obstacle. We assessed the performance of the algorithms according to their learning rate, asymptotic error level, and sensitivity to step-size and bootstrapping parameters. By these measures, the eleven algorithms can be partially ordered on the Collision task. In the top tier, the two Emphatic-TD algorithms learned the fastest, reached the lowest errors, and were robust to parameter settings. In the middle tier, the five Gradient-TD algorithms and Off-policy TD($\\lambda$) were more sensitive to the bootstrapping parameter. The bottom tier comprised Vtrace, Tree Backup, and ABQ; these algorithms were no faster and had higher asymptotic error than the others. Our results are definitive for this task, though of course experiments with more tasks are needed before an overall assessment of the algorithms' merits can be made.",

The objective of the platform is to design a policy that determines prices for shippers and payments to carriers, as well as how carriers are matched to loads to be transported, in order to maximize its long-run average profit. We analyze three types of mechanisms commonly used in freight marketplaces: posted price mechanisms, auction mechanisms, and a hybrid of both. First, we propose a static posted price mechanism and show that it is asymptotically optimal when supply and demand are both large in the network. Then, we consider an auction mechanism based on a Lagrangian decomposition of the network. We show that this auction mechanism is incentive compatible and individually rational, and generates higher profits than the static posted price mechanism in a two-node network. Finally, we study a hybrid mechanism, in which carriers can either book a load instantly by accepting the posted price offered by the platform, or join an auction to seek higher payments. We show that the hybrid mechanism achieves a trade-off between platform profit and carrier waiting time.",

The fundamental objective is to understand the underlying \"invariance\" behind these observational distributions and such invariance has been shown to have a close connection to causality. While many existing approaches make use of the property that causal features are invariant across domains, we consider the causal invariance of the average causal effect of the features to the labels. This invariance regularizes our training approach in which interventions are performed on features to enforce stability of the causal prediction by the classifier across domains. Our work thus sheds some light on the domain generalization problem by introducing invariance of the mechanisms into the learning process. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the performance of the proposed method against SOTAs.",

Accuracy beyond density functional theory is often needed to describe the intermolecular interactions, while most correlated wavefunction (CW) methods are prohibitively expensive for large molecules. Therefore, it posts a great challenge to develop an extendible ab initio force field for large flexible organic molecules at CW level of accuracy. In this work, we face this challenge by combining the physics-driven nonbonding potential with a data-driven subgraph neural network bonding model (named sGNN). Tests on polyethylene glycol polymer chains show that our strategy is highly accurate and robust for molecules of different sizes. Therefore, we can develop the force field from small molecular fragments (with sizes easily accessible to CW methods) and safely transfer it to large polymers, thus opening a new path to the next-generation organic force fields.",

We study this problem numerically through the generalized Kibble-Zurek mechanism of defect distribution in the simplest ferromagnetic one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model with and without coupling to the environment. It is found that simulated quantum annealing reproduces some, but not all, of the properties of the defect distribution in the short-time region. The results suggest the necessity to exert a fair amount of caution in using simulated quantum annealing to study the detailed quantitative aspects of the dynamics of quantum annealing.",

In the RIA calculations, a modified version of the Murdock and Horowitz model that includes a density dependence in the effective nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) interaction was used. A calculation using the theoretical density obtained from a relativistic calculation employing the DD-ME2 interaction successfully reproduced the experimental data for $^{122}$Sn$(p,p)$, but it overestimated the $^{116}$Sn$(p,p)$ and $^{118}$Sn$(p,p)$ cross sections at backward angles. Isotopic analyses of the $(p,p)$ reactions combined with nuclear structure properties were performed based on reaction calculations that used a model density modified from the DD-ME2 density to optimize the neutron density of the Sn isotopes by fitting the isotopic cross section ratios. The resulting optimized density reproduced the experimental $(p,p)$ data for the series of Sn isotopes from $^{116}$Sn to $^{124}$Sn. The neutron root-mean-square(rms) radii and the skin thickness of the Sn isotopes obtained in the present analysis exhibited smooth $A$ dependences in the range of $A=$116--124, which are consistent with the theoretical predictions obtained using the DD-ME2 interaction but seem to contradict the experimental results determined from the $(p,p)$ data. In a detailed analysis of the surface neutron density probed by proton elastic scattering, a signal of the shell effect at $N=66$ in Sn isotopes was found.",

Then, with an online survey (N=50), we assessed the physical and mental demand of our gesture set and identified a subset of 14 gestures that can be performed easily and naturally. Finally, we conducted a remote Wizard-of-Oz usability study (N=11) mapping gestures to various daily smartphone operations under a sitting and walking context.

We make an OntoNotes-like coreference dataset called OntoGUM publicly available, converted from GUM, an English corpus covering 12 genres, using deterministic rules, which we evaluate. Thanks to the rich syntactic and discourse annotations in GUM, we are able to create the largest human-annotated coreference corpus following the OntoNotes guidelines, and the first to be evaluated for consistency with the OntoNotes scheme. Out-of-domain evaluation across 12 genres shows nearly 15-20% degradation for both deterministic and deep learning systems, indicating a lack of generalizability or covert overfitting in existing coreference resolution models.",

        "abstract": "Modern sentence encoders are used to generate dense vector representations that capture the underlying linguistic characteristics for a sequence of words, including phrases, sentences, or paragraphs. These kinds of representations are ideal for training a classifier for an end task such as sentiment analysis, question answering and text classification. Different models have been proposed to efficiently generate general purpose sentence representations to be used in pretraining protocols. While averaging is the most commonly used efficient sentence encoder, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) was recently proposed as an alternative that captures the underlying syntactic characteristics of a given text without compromising practical efficiency compared to averaging. However, as with most other sentence encoders, the DCT sentence encoder was only evaluated in English. To this end, we utilize DCT encoder to generate universal sentence representation for different languages such as German, French, Spanish and Russian. The experimental results clearly show the superior effectiveness of DCT encoding in which consistent performance improvements are achieved over strong baselines on multiple standardized datasets.",

        "abstract": "Multi-agent collision-free trajectory planning and control subject to different goal requirements and system dynamics has been extensively studied, and is gaining recent attention in the realm of machine and reinforcement learning. However, in particular when using a large number of agents, constructing a least-restrictive collision avoidance policy is of utmost importance for both classical and learning-based methods. In this paper, we propose a Least-Restrictive Collision Avoidance Module (LR-CAM) that evaluates the safety of multi-agent systems and takes over control only when needed to prevent collisions. The LR-CAM is a single policy that can be wrapped around policies of all agents in a multi-agent system. It allows each agent to pursue any objective as long as it is safe to do so. The benefit of the proposed least-restrictive policy is to only interrupt and overrule the default controller in case of an upcoming inevitable danger. We use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) to enable the LR-CAM to account for a varying number of agents in the environment. Moreover, we propose an off-policy meta-reinforcement learning framework with a novel reward function based on a Hamilton-Jacobi value function to train the LR-CAM. The proposed method is fully meta-trained through a ROS based simulation and tested on real multi-agent system. Our results show that LR-CAM outperforms the classical least-restrictive baseline by 30 percent. In addition, we show that even if a subset of agents in a multi-agent system use LR-CAM, the success rate of all agents will increase significantly.",

In this paper, we suggest a novel verification tech nique that is based on induction on userdefined rank of program states as an alternative to loopinvariants. Our technique, dubbed inductive rank reduction, works in two steps. Firstly, we simplify the verification problem and prove that the program is correct when the input state con tains an input array of length B or less, using the length of the array as the rank of the state. Secondly, we employ a squeezing function g which converts a program state sigma with an array of length > B to a state g(sigma) containing an array of length minus 1 or less. We prove that when g satisfies certain natural conditions then if the program violates its specification on sigma then it does so also on g(sigma). The correctness of the program on inputs with arrays of arbitrary lengths follows by induction. We make our technique automatic for array programs whose length of execution is proportional to the length of the input arrays by (i) perform ing the first step using symbolic execution, (ii) verifying the conditions required of g using Z3, and (iii) providing a heuristic procedure for syn thesizing g. We implemented our technique and applied it successfully to several interesting arraymanipulating programs, including a bidirec tional summation program whose loop invariant cannot be expressed in firstorder logic while its specification is quantifier free.",

In this paper, we show that, when using the popular logistic regression model, the combined/integrative analysis produces a more accurate estimation of the slope parameters than the single case-control study. It is known that, in a single logistic case-control study, the intercept is not identifiable, contrary to prospective studies. In combined case-control studies, however, the intercepts are proved to be identifiable under mild conditions. The resulting maximum likelihood estimates of the intercepts and slopes are proved to be consistent and asymptotically normal, with asymptotic variances achieving the semiparametric efficiency lower bound.",

The common practice is to construct synthetic data based on a randomly sampled subset of large-scale monolingual data, which we empirically show is sub-optimal. In this work, we propose to improve the sampling procedure by selecting the most informative monolingual sentences to complement the parallel data. To this end, we compute the uncertainty of monolingual sentences using the bilingual dictionary extracted from the parallel data. Intuitively, monolingual sentences with lower uncertainty generally correspond to easy-to-translate patterns which may not provide additional gains. Accordingly, we design an uncertainty-based sampling strategy to efficiently exploit the monolingual data for self-training, in which monolingual sentences with higher uncertainty would be sampled with higher probability. Experimental results on large-scale WMT English$\\Rightarrow$German and English$\\Rightarrow$Chinese datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Extensive analyses suggest that emphasizing the learning on uncertain monolingual sentences by our approach does improve the translation quality of high-uncertainty sentences and also benefits the prediction of low-frequency words at the target side.",

We propose JUMBO, an MBO algorithm that sidesteps these limitations by querying additional data based on a combination of acquisition signals derived from training two Gaussian Processes (GP): a cold-GP operating directly in the input domain and a warm-GP that operates in the feature space of a deep neural network pretrained using the offline data. Such a decomposition can dynamically control the reliability of information derived from the online and offline data and the use of pretrained neural networks permits scalability to large offline datasets. Theoretically, we derive regret bounds for JUMBO and show that it achieves no-regret under conditions analogous to GP-UCB (Srinivas et. al. 2010). Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing approaches on two real-world optimization problems: hyper-parameter optimization and automated circuit design.",

The core technique is entanglement map, which is a feature map to measure the entanglement possibilities obtained from the input image. We use the entanglement map to select probable regions containing graspable objects. The optimum grasping pose is detected from the selected regions considering the collision between robot hand and objects. Experimental results show that our analytic method provides a more comprehensive and intuitive observation of entanglement and exceeds previous learning-based work in success rates.

        "abstract": "The Galactic interstellar medium hosts a significant magnetic field, which can be probed through the synchrotron emission produced from its interaction with relativistic electrons. Linearly polarized synchrotron emission is generated throughout the Galaxy, and at longer wavelengths, modified along nearly every path by Faraday rotation in the intervening magneto-ionic medium. Full characterization of the polarized emission requires wideband observations with many frequency channels. We have surveyed polarized radio emission from the Northern sky over the the range 1280-1750 MHz, with channel width 236.8 kHz, using the John A. Galt Telescope (diameter 25.6 m) at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory, as part of the Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey. The survey covered 72% of the sky, declinations -30 to +87 degrees at all right ascensions. The intensity scale was absolutely calibrated, based on the flux density and spectral index of Cygnus A. Polarization angle was calibrated using the extended polarized emission of the Fan Region. Data are presented as brightness temperatures with angular resolution 40'. Sensitivity in Stokes Q and U is 45 mK rms in a 1.18 MHz band. We have applied rotation measure synthesis to the data to obtain a Faraday depth cube of resolution 150 radians per square metre and sensitivity 3 mK rms of polarized intensity. Features in Faraday depth up to a width of 110 radians per square metre are represented. The maximum detectable Faraday depth is +/- 20,000 radians per square metre. The survey data are available at the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre.",

        "abstract": "Explosive crystallization (EC) is often observed when using nanosecond-pulsed melt laser annealing (MLA) in amorphous silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge). The solidification velocity in EC is so fast that a diffusion-less crystallization can be expected. In the contacts of advanced transistors, the active level at the metal/semiconductor Schottky interface must be very high to achieve a sub-10^{-9} ohm.cm2 contact resistivity, which has been already demonstrated by using the dopant surface segregation induced by MLA. However, the beneficial layer of a few nanometers at the surface may be easily consumed during subsequent contact cleaning and metallization. EC helps to address such kind of process integration issues, enabling the optimal positioning of the peak of the dopant chemical profile. However, there is a lack of experimental studies of EC in heavily-doped semiconductor materials. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, dopant activation by EC has never been experimentally reported. In this paper, we present dopant redistribution and activation by an EC process induced by UV nanosecond-pulsed MLA in heavily gallium (Ga) ion-implanted high Ge content SiGe. Based on the obtained results, we also highlight potential issues of integrating EC into real device fabrication processes and discuss how to manage them.",

Solving the Dirac-Weyl equation in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field and applying infinite-mass boundary condition at the ring boundaries, we obtain analytical results for the energy levels and corresponding wave spinors for both structures. Our results show that the presence of interface boundary in a hybrid BLGR modifies drastically the energy levels as compared to that of an isolated BLGR. The intervalley symmetry $ E^K_e (m) = -E^{K'}_h(m) $ between the electron (e) and hole (h) states ($ m $ being the angular momentum quantum number) is found for the energy spectrum of an isolated BLGR, while it is broken for the hybrid BLGR. Our analytical results agree with those obtained within the tight-binding model (TBM). Sizeable and magnetically tunable band gap, in contrast to that in the zero-width BLGR model, is predicted for both ring structures, which experimentally can be measured in, e.g., magnetotransport measurements.",

Our work tackles the problem of detecting out-of-domain samples with only unsupervised in-domain data. We utilize the latent representations of pre-trained transformers and propose a simple yet effective method to transform features across all layers to construct out-of-domain detectors efficiently. Two domain-specific fine-tuning approaches are further proposed to boost detection accuracy. Our empirical evaluations of related methods on two datasets validate that our method greatly improves out-of-domain detection ability in a more general scenario.",

        "abstract": "Although recent advances in deep learning technology improved automatic speech recognition (ASR), it remains difficult to recognize speech when it overlaps other people's voices. Speech separation or extraction is often used as a front-end to ASR to handle such overlapping speech. However, deep neural network-based speech enhancement can generate `processing artifacts' as a side effect of the enhancement, which degrades ASR performance. For example, it is well known that single-channel noise reduction for non-speech noise (non-overlapping speech) often does not improve ASR. Likewise, the processing artifacts may also be detrimental to ASR in some conditions when processing overlapping speech with a separation/extraction method, although it is usually believed that separation/extraction improves ASR. In order to answer the question `Do we always have to separate/extract speech from mixtures?', we analyze ASR performance on observed and enhanced speech at various noise and interference conditions, and show that speech enhancement degrades ASR under some conditions even for overlapping speech. Based on these findings, we propose a simple switching algorithm between observed and enhanced speech based on the estimated signal-to-interference ratio and signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrated experimentally that such a simple switching mechanism can improve recognition performance when processing artifacts are detrimental to ASR.",

While generally effective, these models fail to provide a satisfying answer when all retrieved candidates are of poor quality, even if they contain correct information. In AS2, models are trained to select the best answer sentence among a set of candidates retrieved for a given question. In this work, we propose to generate answers from a set of AS2 top candidates. Rather than selecting the best candidate, we train a sequence to sequence transformer model to generate an answer from a candidate set. Our tests on three English AS2 datasets show improvement up to 32 absolute points in accuracy over the state of the art.",

In this paper, we design a novel end-to-end framework, namely, Review-augmented Conversational Recommender (RevCore), where reviews are seamlessly incorporated to enrich item information and assist in generating both coherent and informative responses. In detail, we extract sentiment-consistent reviews, perform review-enriched and entity-based recommendations for item suggestions, as well as use a review-attentive encoder-decoder for response generation.

A common, simplifying assumption of such collective movement models, is the consideration of individual agents moving with a constant speed. In this work we critically re-asses this assumption underlying a vast majority of collective movement models. First, we show the omnipresent speed variability observed in different species of live fish and artificial agents (RoboFish). Based on theoretical considerations accounting for inertia and rotational friction, we derive a functional dependence of the turning response of individuals on their instantaneous speed (confirmed by experimental data). We investigate how the interplay of variable speed and speed-dependent turning affects self-organized collective behavior by implementing an agent-based model which accounts for both effects. We show, that besides average speed, the individual speed variability may have a dramatic impact on the emergent collective dynamics, as two groups differing only in their speed variability, and being otherwise identical in all other behavioral parameters, can be in two fundamentally different stationary states. We find that the local coupling between group polarization and individual speed is strongest at the order-disorder transition. Furthermore, we demonstrate a decrease in polarization with group size for groups of individuals with variable speed, and a sudden decrease in mean individual speed at a critical group size (N=4 for Voronoi interactions) linked to a topological transition from an all-to-all to a distributed spatial interaction network. Overall, our work highlights the importance to account for fundamental kinematic constraints in general, and variable speed in particular, when modeling self-organized collective dynamics.",

Due to the distributed nature of MAS network, the information available to an individual agent is limited to its vicinity. From the entire MAS aspect, this imposes the structural constraint on the control law, making the optimal control law computationally intractable. This paper attempts to relax such a structural constraint by expanding the neighboring information for each agent to the entire MAS, enabled by the distributed estimation algorithm embedded in each agent. By exploiting the estimated information, each agent is not limited to interact with its neighborhood but further establishing the `virtual interactions' with the non-neighboring agents. Then the optimal distributed MAS control problem is cast as a synthesized control-estimation problem. An iterative optimization procedure is developed to find the control-estimation law, minimizing the global objective cost of MAS.",

Specifically we consider the problem of estimating the bottom impermeable boundary to an inviscid, incompressible, irrotational fluid from measurements of the free-surface deviation alone, within the context of dispersive shallow-water wave models. The need to consider the shallow-water regime arises from the ill-posed nature of the problem and is motivated by prior work. We design an algorithm using which, both fluid velocities and the bottom-boundary profile, may be accurately recovered assuming an a priori relatively inaccurate guess for the bottom boundary. We achieve this by considering two separate inverse problems: one to deduce the bottom-boundary from velocities and the surface deviation, and another to recover the velocities from the surface deviation and an approximate bottom-boundary. The former is a classic inverse problem that requires the inversion of an ill-conditioned matrix while the latter employs the observer framework. Combining the two inverse problems leads to our reconstruction algorithm. We emphasise the role played by model selection and its impact on algorithm design and the accuracy of the reconstruction.",

In industry, development artefacts such as components or units, are often reused from existing artefacts to save time and costs. When development artefacts are reused, their existing safety analysis models are an important input for an early safety assessment for the new system, since they already provide a valid model. Component fault trees support such reuse strategies by a compositional horizontal approach. But current development strategies do not only divide systems horizontally, e.g., By encapsulating different functionality into separate components and hierarchies of components, but also vertically, e.g. Into software and hardware architecture layers. Current safety analysis methodologies, such as component fault trees, do not support such vertical layers. Therefore, we present here a methodology that is able to divide safety analysis models into different layers of a systems architecture. We use so called Architecture Layer Failure Dependencies to enable component fault trees on different layers of an architecture. These dependencies are then used to generate safety evidence for the entire system and over all different architecture layers. A case study applies the approach to hardware and software layers.",

This paper introduces a mechanism for tackling this imprecision. This mechanism, which we call temporal prophecy, is inspired by prophecy variables. Temporal prophecy refines an infinite-state system using first-order linear temporal logic formulas, via a suitable tableau construction. For a specific liveness-to-safety transformation based on first-order logic, we show that using temporal prophecy strictly increases the precision. Furthermore, temporal prophecy leads to robustness of the proof method, which is manifested by a cut elimination theorem. We integrate our approach into the Ivy deductive verification system, and show that it can handle challenging temporal verification examples.",

At each resolution level, MGN employs higher order message passing to encode the graph while learning to partition it into mutually exclusive clusters and coarsening into a lower resolution. MGVAE constructs a hierarchical generative model based on MGN to variationally autoencode the hierarchy of coarsened graphs. Our proposed framework is end-to-end permutation equivariant with respect to node ordering. Our methods have been successful with several generative tasks including link prediction on citation graphs, unsupervised molecular representation learning to predict molecular properties, molecular generation, general graph generation and graph-based image generation.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between mass and radius (M-R relation) is the key for inferring the planetary compositions and thus valuable for the studies of formation and migration models. However, the M-R relation alone is not enough for planetary characterization due to the dependence of it on other confounding variables. This paper provides a non-trivial extension of the M-R relation by including the incident flux as an additional variable. By using Bayesian hierarchical modeling (BHM) that leverages the flexibility of finite mixture models, a probabilistic mass-radius-flux relationship (M-R-F relation) is obtained based on a sample of 319 exoplanets. We find that the flux has nonnegligible impact on the M-R relation, while such impact is strongest for hot-Jupiters. On the population level, the planets with higher level of flux tend to be denser, and high flux could trigger significant mass loss for plants with radii larger than $13R_{\\oplus}$. As a result, failing to account for the flux in mass prediction would cause systematic over or under-estimation. With the recent advent of computing power, although a lot of complex statistical models can be fitted using Monte Carlo methods, it has largely remain illusive how to validate these complex models when the data are observed with large measurement errors. We present two novel methods to examine model assumptions, which can be used not only for the models we present in this paper but can also be adapted for other statistical models.",

We further propose DisCOC to inject and fuse the sentence-level structural discourse information with contextualized features derived from large-scale language models. Experimental results and extensive analysis show that the attention and gate mechanisms that explicitly model contexts and texts can indeed help the argument impact classification task defined by Durmus et al.

In this paper, we present a new approach to improve the capability of language model pre-training on VRDs. Firstly, we introduce a new IE model that is query-based and employs the span extraction formulation instead of the commonly used sequence labelling approach. Secondly, to further extend the span extraction formulation, we propose a new training task which focuses on modelling the relationships between semantic entities within a document. This task enables the spans to be extracted recursively and can be used as both a pre-training objective as well as an IE downstream task. Evaluation on various datasets of popular business documents (invoices, receipts) shows that our proposed method can improve the performance of existing models significantly, while providing a mechanism to accumulate model knowledge from multiple downstream IE tasks.",

A discrete symmetry $\\mathcal{Z}_2\\times\\mathcal{Z}_2^\\prime$ has been imposed under which all the SM particles are even while the new particles may be assumed to have odd charges. In a bottom-up approach, with a minimal particle content, we systematically explore the available parameter space in terms of couplings and masses of the new particles. Here a number of observables associated with the SM leptons have been considered, e.g., masses and mixings of neutrinos, $(g-2)$ anomalies of $e$, $\\mu$, charged lepton flavor violating (cLFV) observables and the dark matter (DM) phenomenology of a singlet-doublet dark matter. Neutrinos, promoted as the Dirac type states, acquire mass at one loop level after the discrete $\\mathcal{Z}_2^\\prime$ symmetry gets softly broken, while the unbroken $\\mathcal{Z}_2$ keeps the dark matter stable. The mixing between the singlet $\\psi$ and the doublet vector lepton can be constrained to satisfy the electroweak precision observables and the spin independent (SI) direct detection (DD) cross section of the dark matter. In this analysis, potentially important LHC bounds have also been discussed.",

        "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic has strained the hospital systems in many countries in the world, especially in developing countries. In many low-resource hospitals, severely ill hypoxemic Covid-19 patients are treated with various forms of low-flow oxygen therapy (0-15 L/min), including interfaces such as a nasal cannula, Hudson mask, venturi-mask, and non-rebreather masks. When 15L/min of pure oxygen flow is not sufficient for the patient, treatment guidelines suggest non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or high-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) as the next stage of treatment. However, administering HFNO in the general wards of a low-resource hospital is difficult due to several factors, including difficulty in operation, unavailability of electric power outlets, and frequent maintenance. Therefore, in many cases, the highest level of care a patient receives in the general ward is 15L/min of oxygen on a Non-Rebreather Mask. With a shortage of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, this is a major problem since intermediate forms of treatments are simply not available at an affordable cost. To address this gap, we have developed a low-cost CPAP system specifically designed for low-resource hospitals. The device is a precision venturi-based flow-generator capable of providing up to 60L/min of flow. The device utilizes the mechanics of a jet pump driven by high-pressure oxygen to increase the volumetric flow rate by entraining atmospheric air. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) can be attained between 40 - 100% using a dual-flowmeter. Consisting of a traditional 22mm breathing circuit, a non-vented CPAP mask, and a Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) valve, the CPAP can provide positive pressures between 5-20 cm H2O. The device is manufactured using local 3D printing and workshop facilities.",

A basic promise of existing PLL solutions is that there are sufficient partial-label (PL) samples for training. However, it is more common than not to have just few PL samples at hand when dealing with new tasks. Furthermore, existing few-shot learning algorithms assume precise labels of the support set; as such, irrelevant labels may seriously mislead the meta-learner and thus lead to a compromised performance. How to enable PLL under a few-shot learning setting is an important problem, but not yet well studied. In this paper, we introduce an approach called FsPLL (Few-shot PLL). FsPLL first performs adaptive distance metric learning by an embedding network and rectifying prototypes on the tasks previously encountered. Next, it calculates the prototype of each class of a new task in the embedding network. An unseen example can then be classified via its distance to each prototype. Experimental results on widely-used few-shot datasets (Omniglot and miniImageNet) demonstrate that our FsPLL can achieve a superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods across different settings, and it needs fewer samples for quickly adapting to new tasks.",

The effective exploitation of correspondence between different views facilitates the SR performance, while the high-resolution (HR) features with richer details benefit the correspondence estimation. According to this motivation, we propose a Stereo Super-Resolution and Disparity Estimation Feedback Network (SSRDE-FNet), which simultaneously handles the stereo image super-resolution and disparity estimation in a unified framework and interact them with each other to further improve their performance. Specifically, the SSRDE-FNet is composed of two dual recursive sub-networks for left and right views. Besides the cross-view information exploitation in the low-resolution (LR) space, HR representations produced by the SR process are utilized to perform HR disparity estimation with higher accuracy, through which the HR features can be aggregated to generate a finer SR result. Afterward, the proposed HR Disparity Information Feedback (HRDIF) mechanism delivers information carried by HR disparity back to previous layers to further refine the SR image reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advancement of SSRDE-FNet.",

To remove these fiber-channel risks, we consider a network where a space-based relay, Micius satellite, executes a sequence of keys delivery missions, allowing thus any two cities to have a shared key. In this work, we develop a comprehensive framework integrated with the precise orbital modeling and the cloud statistics model to enable a pre-assessment on the satellite-based QKD applications. Using this framework, we consider three different scheduling strategies and estimate the keys possible to deliver to the cities, respectively. Results show that the strategy of pursing the total final keys maximized significantly embodies space-based QKD advantage, while the strategy of considering different levels of missions achieves more keys delivered to a higher priority mission. Most importantly, the targeted strategy of pursuing the distribution of final keys delivered being coincident with network traffic distribution, guarantees the individual needs, further promoting the utilization of delivered keys in practice. We also provide a comparison between the total number of delivered keys by the satellite with different altitude orbits. It is demonstrated that the plans for constructing a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation, are more effective than that for employing an expensive high-orbit satellite, for a realization of the potential applications. Our works not only provides a practical method in the near term but also gives the aforehand exploration to establish satellite-based quantum communication network.",

Namely, they have to recognize the static and dynamic obstacles, plan the driving path and execute their motion. For addressing the issue of perception and path planning, in this paper, we introduce OctoPath , which is an encoder-decoder deep neural network, trained in a self-supervised manner to predict the local optimal trajectory for the ego-vehicle. Using the discretization provided by a 3D octree environment model, our approach reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification problem with a configurable resolution. During training, OctoPath minimizes the error between the predicted and the manually driven trajectories in a given training dataset. This allows us to avoid the pitfall of regression-based trajectory estimation, in which there is an infinite state space for the output trajectory points. Environment sensing is performed using a 40-channel mechanical LiDAR sensor, fused with an inertial measurement unit and wheels odometry for state estimation. The experiments are performed both in simulation and real-life, using our own developed GridSim simulator and RovisLab's Autonomous Mobile Test Unit platform. We evaluate the predictions of OctoPath in different driving scenarios, both indoor and outdoor, while benchmarking our system against a baseline hybrid A-Star algorithm and a regression-based supervised learning method, as well as against a CNN learning-based optimal path planning method.",

However, these SOTA solvers only generate binary expression trees that contain basic arithmetic operators and do not explicitly use the math formulas. As a result, the expression trees they produce are lengthy and uninterpretable because they need to use multiple operators and constants to represent one single formula. In this paper, we propose sequence-to-general tree (S2G) that learns to generate interpretable and executable operation trees where the nodes can be formulas with an arbitrary number of arguments. With nodes now allowed to be formulas, S2G can learn to incorporate mathematical domain knowledge into problem-solving, making the results more interpretable. Experiments show that S2G can achieve a better performance against strong baselines on problems that require domain knowledge.",

For the first task, we compute the heat generated by the nanomagnets (or the specific absorption rate $\\mathfrak{S}$) using the ac susceptibility in the linear regime. For the second task, the loss of heat to the environment is modeled with the help of a balance (macroscopic) equation based on Newton's law of cooling. This equation is solved both numerically and analytically for a generic ferrofluid and the analytical solution renders a very good approximation to the general balance equation. Applying this formalism to maghemite and magnetite ferrofluids and using the corresponding experimental data, we investigate the effects of AMF frequency and amplitude on the temperature elevation during its temporal evolution. Finally, upon fitting our results to the available experimental data, we discuss the behavior of Newton's heat transfer coefficient in terms of the AMF amplitude and frequency. These results could trigger experimental investigations of this coefficient which characterizes the rate of heating in a ferrofluid, with the aim to build more refined models for the mechanisms of heat generation and its diffusion in ferrofluids used in magnetic hyperthermia.",

        "abstract": "Voice conversion has gained increasing popularity in many applications of speech synthesis. The idea is to change the voice identity from one speaker into another while keeping the linguistic content unchanged. Many voice conversion approaches rely on the use of a vocoder to reconstruct the speech from acoustic features, and as a consequence, the speech quality heavily depends on such a vocoder. In this paper, we propose NVC-Net, an end-to-end adversarial network, which performs voice conversion directly on the raw audio waveform of arbitrary length. By disentangling the speaker identity from the speech content, NVC-Net is able to perform non-parallel traditional many-to-many voice conversion as well as zero-shot voice conversion from a short utterance of an unseen target speaker. Importantly, NVC-Net is non-autoregressive and fully convolutional, achieving fast inference. Our model is capable of producing samples at a rate of more than 3600 kHz on an NVIDIA V100 GPU, being orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods under the same hardware configurations. Objective and subjective evaluations on non-parallel many-to-many voice conversion tasks show that NVC-Net obtains competitive results with significantly fewer parameters.",

Traditionally, in a remote DNN inference problem, an edge device transmits raw data to a remote node that performs the inference task. However, this may incur high transmission energy costs and puts data privacy at risk. In this paper, we propose a technique to reduce the total energy bill at the edge device by utilizing model compression and time-varying model split between the edge and remote nodes. The time-varying representation accounts for time-varying channels and can significantly reduce the total energy at the edge device while maintaining high accuracy (low loss). We implement our approach in an image classification task using the MNIST dataset, and the system environment is simulated as a trajectory navigation scenario to emulate different channel conditions. Numerical simulations show that our proposed solution results in minimal energy consumption and $CO_2$ emission compared to the considered baselines while exhibiting robust performance across different channel conditions and bandwidth regime choices.",

Current modularized Bayesian inference methods accommodate partial misspecification from single component of the model. We extend these methods to handle partial misspecification in more than one component of the model, as required for our Bayesian GWR model. Information from the various spatial locations is manipulated via a geographically weighted kernel and the optimal manipulation is chosen according to a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We justify the model via an information risk minimization approach and show the consistency of the proposed estimator in terms of a geographically weighted KL divergence.",

Standard SL algorithms assume an ideal underlying digital communication system and ignore the problem of scarce communication bandwidth. However, for a large number of agents, limited bandwidth resources, and time-varying communication channels, the communication bandwidth can become the bottleneck. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a novel SL framework to solve the remote inference problem that introduces an additional layer at the agent side and constrains the choices of the weights and the biases to ensure over the air aggregation. Hence, the proposed approach maintains constant communication cost with respect to the number of agents enabling remote inference under limited bandwidth. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the digital implementation in terms of communication-efficiency, especially as the number of agents grows large.",

Consequently, training standard gated cells such as gated recurrent units and long-short term memory on benchmarks where long-term memory is required remains an arduous task. In this work, we propose a general way to initialize any recurrent network connectivity through a process called \"warm-up\" to improve its capability to learn arbitrarily long time dependencies. This initialization process is designed to maximize network reachable multi-stability, i.e. the number of attractors within the network that can be reached through relevant input trajectories. Warming-up is performed before training, using stochastic gradient descent on a specifically designed loss. We show that warming-up greatly improves recurrent neural network performance on long-term memory benchmarks for multiple recurrent cell types, but can sometimes impede precision. We therefore introduce a parallel recurrent network structure with partial warm-up that is shown to greatly improve learning on long time-series while maintaining high levels of precision. This approach provides a general framework for improving learning abilities of any recurrent cell type when long-term memory is required.",

Otherwise, they fall short in correctly predicting both the low and high frequency behaviours of turbulence induced phase distortions. Sub-harmonic compensation is a commonly used technique that aids in low-frequency correction but does not solve the problem for all values of screen size to outer scale parameter ratios $(G/L_0$). A subharmonics based approach will lead to unequal sampling or weights calculation for subharmonics addition at the low-frequency range and patch normalization factor. We have modified the subharmonics based approach by introducing a Gaussian phase autocorrelation matrix that compensates for these shortfalls. We show that the maximum relative error in structure function with respect to theoretical value is as small as 0.5-3% for $(G/L_0$) ratio of 1/1000 even for screen sizes up to 100 m diameter.",

Since the shortest geodesic is used to define an interaction between two particles, if there exist two or more than two shortest geodesics, then the system is not well-defined. In this paper, instead of using the shortest geodesic to define an interaction between two particles, we use all geodesics to define an interaction. From this assumption, we can relax the a-priori condition and conditions on communication functions. We also explain the relationship between the suggested model and previous models. Finally, we provide some emergent behaviors on some specific manifolds(e.g. flat torus, flat M\u00f6bius strip, and flat Klein bottle).

Since a 2-dimensional zonotope is a centrally-symmetric polygon, this can also be considered a generalization to higher dimension of similar estimates that have been established for $2$-dimensional convex chains. As we shall see, the exponential part of our estimate is composed of a polynomial of degree $d$ in $n^{1/(d+1)}$, and involves Riemann's zeta function and depends on the Riemann hypothesis. Our analysis is based on a mapping between sums of coprime numbers and Eulerian polynomials. We also analyse some combinatorial properties of lattice zonotopes.

FedHealth 2 obtains the client similarities via a pretrained model, and then it averages all weighted models with preserving local batch normalization.

This is done in a very general setting, with nonlinear terms admitting maximal monotone graphs both in the bulk and on the boundary. The two graphs are related by a growth condition, with the boundary graph that dominates the other one. It turns out that in the limiting procedure the solution of the problem looses some regularity and the limit equation has to be properly interpreted in the sense of a subdifferential inclusion. However, the limit problem is still well-posed since a continuous dependence estimate can be proved. Moreover, in the case when the two graphs exhibit the same growth, it is shown that the solution enjoys more regularity and the boundary condition holds almost everywhere. An error estimate can also be shown, for a suitable order of the diffusion parameter.",

Unlike most conventional methods that rely exclusively on grid search, we introduce a continuous optimization algorithm to refine DOA estimates beyond the resolution of the initial grid. The algorithm is derived from the majorization-minimization (MM) technique. We derive two surrogate functions, one quadratic and one linear. Both lead to efficient iterative algorithms that do not require hyperparameters, such as step size, and ensure that the DOA estimates never leave the array manifold, without the need for a projection step. In numerical experiments, we show that the accuracy after a few iterations of the MM algorithm nearly removes dependency on the resolution of the initial grid used. We find that the quadratic surrogate function leads to very fast convergence, but the simplicity of the linear algorithm is very attractive, and the performance gap small.",

Countries such as Italy have enforced a total lockdown lasting several months, with most of the population forced to remain at home. During this time, online social networks, more than ever, have represented an alternative solution for social life, allowing users to interact and debate with each other. Hence, it is of paramount importance to understand the changing use of social networks brought about by the pandemic. In this paper, we analyze how the interaction patterns around popular influencers in Italy changed during the first six months of 2020, within Instagram and Facebook social networks. We collected a large dataset for this group of public figures, including more than 54 million comments on over 140 thousand posts for these months. We analyze and compare engagement on the posts of these influencers and provide quantitative figures for aggregated user activity. We further show the changes in the patterns of usage before and during the lockdown, which demonstrated a growth of activity and sizable daily and weekly variations. We also analyze the user sentiment through the psycholinguistic properties of comments, and the results testified the rapid boom and disappearance of topics related to the pandemic. To support further analyses, we release the anonymized dataset.",

However, it remains poorly understood how the dynamic interplay of these components and the cell polarity determine the emergent migration behavior at the cellular scale. Here, we employ a data-driven theoretical approach to develop a mechanistic model for confined cell migration, revealing how the cellular dynamics adapt to confining geometries. Specifically, we use experimental data of joint protrusion-nucleus migration trajectories of cells on confining micropatterns to systematically determine a model linking the stochastic dynamics of cell polarity, protrusions, and nucleus. Our model indicates that the cellular dynamics adapt to confining constrictions through a switch in the polarity dynamics from a negative to a positive, self-reinforcing feedback loop. This feedback loop leads to stereotypical cycles of protrusion-nucleus dynamics that drive the migration of the cell through constrictions. Our data-driven theoretical approach therefore identifies polarity feedback adaptation as a key mechanism in confined cell migration.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose SACHER (soft actor-critic (SAC) with hindsight experience replay (HER)), which constitutes a class of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. SAC is known as an off-policy model-free DRL algorithm based on the maximum entropy framework, which outperforms earlier DRL algorithms in terms of exploration, robustness and learning performance. However, in SAC, maximizing the entropy-augmented objective may degrade the optimality of learning outcomes. HER is known as a sample-efficient replay method that enhances the performance of off-policy DRL algorithms by allowing the agent to learn from both failures and successes. We apply HER to SAC and propose SACHER to improve the learning performance of SAC. More precisely, SACHER achieves the desired optimal outcomes faster and more accurately than SAC, since HER improves the sample efficiency of SAC. We apply SACHER to the navigation and control problem of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where SACHER generates the optimal navigation path of the UAV under various obstacles in operation. Specifically, we show the effectiveness of SACHER in terms of the tracking error and cumulative reward in UAV operation by comparing them with those of state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, SAC and DDPG. Note that SACHER in UAV navigation and control problems can be applied to arbitrary models of UAVs.",

One problem with conventional clustering is that it does not take the final use of the clustered data into account, which may lead to a very suboptimal use of energy or computational resources. When clustered data are used by a decision-making entity, it turns out that significant gains can be obtained by tailoring the clustering scheme to the final task performed by the decision-making entity. The key to having good final performance is to automatically extract the important attributes of the data space that are inherently relevant to the subsequent decision-making entity, and partition the data space based on these attributes instead of partitioning the data space based on predefined conventional metrics. For this purpose, we formulate the framework of decision-making oriented clustering and propose an algorithm providing a decision-based partition of the data space and good representative decisions. By applying this novel framework and algorithm to a typical problem of real-time pricing and that of power consumption scheduling, we obtain several insightful analytical results such as the expression of the best representative price profiles for real-time pricing and a very significant reduction in terms of required clusters to perform power consumption scheduling as shown by our simulations.",

Knowledge distillation is a popular technique to compress PLMs, which learns a small student model from a large teacher PLM. However, the knowledge learned from a single teacher may be limited and even biased, resulting in low-quality student model. In this paper, we propose a multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework named MT-BERT for pre-trained language model compression, which can train high-quality student model from multiple teacher PLMs. In MT-BERT we design a multi-teacher co-finetuning method to jointly finetune multiple teacher PLMs in downstream tasks with shared pooling and prediction layers to align their output space for better collaborative teaching. In addition, we propose a multi-teacher hidden loss and a multi-teacher distillation loss to transfer the useful knowledge in both hidden states and soft labels from multiple teacher PLMs to the student model. Experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of MT-BERT in compressing PLMs.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies report that many machine reading comprehension (MRC) models can perform closely to or even better than humans on benchmark datasets. However, existing works indicate that many MRC models may learn shortcuts to outwit these benchmarks, but the performance is unsatisfactory in real-world applications. In this work, we attempt to explore, instead of the expected comprehension skills, why these models learn the shortcuts. Based on the observation that a large portion of questions in current datasets have shortcut solutions, we argue that larger proportion of shortcut questions in training data make models rely on shortcut tricks excessively. To investigate this hypothesis, we carefully design two synthetic datasets with annotations that indicate whether a question can be answered using shortcut solutions. We further propose two new methods to quantitatively analyze the learning difficulty regarding shortcut and challenging questions, and revealing the inherent learning mechanism behind the different performance between the two kinds of questions. A thorough empirical analysis shows that MRC models tend to learn shortcut questions earlier than challenging questions, and the high proportions of shortcut questions in training sets hinder models from exploring the sophisticated reasoning skills in the later stage of training.",

        "abstract": "We present novel lower bounds on the localization error using a network of satellites randomly deployed on a sphere around Earth. Our new analysis approach characterizes the localization performance by its asymptotic behavior as the number of satellites gets large while assuming a dense network. Using the law of large numbers, we derive closed-form expressions for the asymptotic Cramer Rao bound (CRB) from which we draw valuable insights. The resulting expressions depend solely on the network statistics and are not a function of a particular network configuration. We consider two types of estimators. The first uses the exact statistical model, and hence employs both timing and amplitude information. The second estimator ignores the amplitudes and hence uses only time difference of arrival (TDOA) information. The asymptotic CRB indicates that for practical system setup, a TDOA estimator approaches the performance of the ideal estimator. For both estimators, the localization accuracy improves as satellites get closer to Earth. The latter finding is essential in light of the proliferation of low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites and motivates a further study of localization-performance in such networks. Besides, we show that the vertical localization accuracy is lower than the horizontal accuracy and is also more sensitive to the receiver field-of-view.",

This microscope uses a pump-probe method, where the sample is pumped at 1030 nm, and magnetic domain images are acquired via MOKE microscopy at 515 nm (the second harmonic). We successfully observed the dynamics of the magnetic domain of the NCO thin film via laser irradiation, and obtained a demagnetization time constant of approximately 0.4 ps. This time constant was significantly smaller than the large time constants reported for other half-metallic oxides. These results, combined with the results of our x-ray photoemission spectroscopy study, indicate that this NCO thin film is a ferrimagnetic metal whose electronic structure deviates from the theoretically predicted half-metallic one.",

Monte Carlo simulations have indicated that about 15% of the neutron counts by PSNM are due to interactions (mostly in the lead producer) of GeV-range protons among the atmospheric secondary particles from cosmic ray showers, which can be detected by the scintillator and silicon detectors. Those detectors can provide a timing trigger for measurement of the propagation time distribution of such neutrons as they scatter and propagate through the NM64, processes that are similar whether the interaction was initiated by an energetic proton (for 15% of the count rate) or neutron (for 80% of the count rate). This propagation time distribution underlies the time delay distribution between successive neutron counts, from which we can determine the leader fraction (inverse multiplicity), which has been used to monitor Galactic cosmic ray spectral variations over $\\sim$1-40 GV. Here we have measured and characterized the propagation time distribution from both the experimental setup and Monte Carlo simulations of atmospheric secondary particle detection. We confirm a known propagation time distribution with a peak (at $\\approx$70 microseconds) and tail over a few ms, dominated by neutron counts. We fit this distribution using an analytic model of neutron diffusion and absorption, for both experimental and Monte Carlo results. In addition we identify a group of prompt neutron monitor pulses that arrive within 20 microseconds of the charged-particle trigger, of which a substantial fraction can be attributed to charged-particle ionization in a proportional counter, according to both experimental and Monte Carlo ...",

Molecules can contain many types of functional groups, which will affect the properties the molecules. For example, the toxicity of a molecule is associated with toxicophores, such as nitroaromatic groups and thiourea. Conventional graph-based methods that consider the pair-wise interactions between nodes are inefficient in expressing the complex relationship between multiple nodes in a graph flexibly, and applying multi-hops may result in oversmoothing and overfitting problems. Hence, we propose MolHGCN to capture the substructural difference between molecules using the atom and functional group information. MolHGCN constructs a hypergraph representation of a molecule using functional group information from the input SMILES strings, extracts hidden representation using a two-stage message passing process (atom and functional group message passing), and predicts the properties of the molecules using the extracted hidden representation. We evaluate the performance of our model using Tox21, ClinTox, SIDER, BBBP, BACE, ESOL, FreeSolv and Lipophilicity datasets. We show that our model is able to outperform other baseline methods for most of the datasets. We particularly show that incorporating functional group information along with atom information results in better separability in the latent space, thus increasing the prediction accuracy of the molecule property prediction.",

The magnitude of the effect allows obtaining technically viable mobile charge density for optoelectronic devices without impurity doping (donors or acceptors). Therefore, it provides an additional tool for the device designer, with the potential to attain high conductivities: high carrier concentrations can be obtained even in materials with high dopant ionization energies, and the mobility is not limited by scattering at ionized impurities.",

Knowledge of the system topology can aid in detecting anomalies, spotting trends, predicting future behavior and so on. Different from the majority of pioneering works, this paper investigates the principles and performances of topology inference from the perspective of node causality and correlation. Specifically, we advocate a comprehensive analysis framework to unveil the mutual relationship, convergence and accuracy of the proposed methods and other benchmark methods, i.e., the Granger and ordinary least square (OLS) estimators. Our method allows for unknown observation noises, both asymptotic and marginal stabilities for NDSs, while encompasses a correlation-based modification design to alleviate performance degradation in small observation scale. To explicitly demonstrate the inference performance of the estimators, we leverage the concentration measure in Gaussian space, and derive the non-asymptotic rates of the inference errors for linear time-invariant (LTI) cases. Considering when the observations are not sufficient to support the estimators, we provide an excitation-based method to infer the one-hop and multi-hop neighbors with probability guarantees. Furthermore, we point out the theoretical results can be extended to switching topologies and nonlinear dynamics cases. Extensive simulations highlight the outperformance of the proposed method.",

In this paper, we propose a novel NLP task of identifying directed sentiment relationship between political entities from a given news document, which we call directed sentiment extraction. From a million-scale news corpus, we construct a dataset of news sentences where sentiment relations of political entities are manually annotated. We present a simple but effective approach for utilizing a pretrained transformer, which infers the target class by predicting multiple question-answering tasks and combining the outcomes. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed method for social science research questions by analyzing positive and negative opinions between political entities in two major events: 2016 U.S. presidential election and COVID-19. The newly proposed problem, data, and method will facilitate future studies on interdisciplinary NLP methods and applications.",

        "abstract": "Deficit Round-Robin (DRR) is a widespread scheduling algorithm that provides fair queueing with variable-length packets. Bounds on worst-case delays for DRR were found by Boyer et al., who used a rigorous network calculus approach and characterized the service obtained by one flow of interest by means of a convex strict service curve. These bounds do not make any assumptions on the interfering traffic hence are pessimistic when the interfering traffic is constrained by some arrival curves. For such cases, two improvements were proposed. The former, by Soni et al., uses a correction term derived from a semi-rigorous heuristic; unfortunately, these bounds are incorrect, as we show by exhibiting a counter-example. The latter, by Bouillard, rigorously derive convex strict service curves for DRR that account for the arrival curve constraints of the interfering traffic. In this paper, we improve on these results in two ways. First, we derive a non-convex strict service curve for DRR that improves on Boyer et al. when there is no arrival constraint on the interfering traffic. Second, we provide an iterative method to improve any strict service curve (including Bouillard's) when there are arrival constraints for the interfering traffic. As of today, our results provide the best-known worst-case delay bounds for DRR. They are obtained by using the method of the pseudo-inverse.",

Traditional assessment of surgical skills involves strenuous manual efforts, which lacks efficiency and repeatability.

In this paper, a unified multi-path framework for automatic surgical skill assessment is proposed, which takes care of multiple composing aspects of surgical skills, including surgical tool usage, intraoperative event pattern, and other skill proxies. The dependency relationships among these different aspects are specially modeled by a path dependency module in the framework. We conduct extensive experiments on the JIGSAWS dataset of simulated surgical tasks, and a new clinical dataset of real laparoscopic surgeries. The proposed framework achieves promising results on both datasets, with the state-of-the-art on the simulated dataset advanced from 0.71 Spearman's correlation to 0.80. It is also shown that combining multiple skill aspects yields better performance than relying on a single aspect.",

In fact, this appears to be one of the main conceptual obstacles to uniting the two theories. Additionally, a combination of the two theories is expected to yield non-classical, or \"indefinite\", causal structures. In this paper, we present a background-independent formulation of the process matrix formalism - a form of quantum mechanics that allows for indefinite causal structure - while retaining operationally well-defined measurement statistics. We do this by postulating an arbitrary probability distribution of measurement outcomes across discrete \"chunks\" of spacetime, which we think of as physical laboratories, and then requiring that this distribution be invariant under any permutation of laboratories. We find (a) that one still obtains nontrivial, indefinite causal structures with background independence, (b) that we lose the idea of local operations in distinct laboratories, but can recover it by encoding a reference frame into the physical states of our system, and (c) that permutation invariance imposes surprising symmetry constraints that, although formally similar to a superselection rule, cannot be interpreted as such.",

Here we present the result of a machine learned automatic classification based on the morphology of light curves inspired by the classification of eclipsing binaries observed by the original Kepler mission. We similarly use a dimensionality reduction technique, the locally linear embedding to map the high dimension of the data set into a low dimensional embedding parameter space, while keeping the local geometry and the similarities of the neighbouring data points. After three consecutive steps, we assign one parameter to each binary star, which well scales with the \"detachness\", i.e. the sum of the relative radii of the components. This value is in good agreement with the morphology types listed in the OGLE catalog and, along with the orbital periods, can be used to filter any morphological sub-types based on the similarity of light curves. Our open-source pipeline can be applied in a fully automatic way to any other large data set to classify binary stars.",

It can effectively reduce the complexity and meanwhile capture global document context in the modeling of each sentence. More specifically, we first use a sentence Transformer to learn the representations of each sentence. Then we use a document Transformer to model the global document context from these sentence representations. Next, we use another sentence Transformer to enhance sentence modeling using the global document context. Finally, we use hierarchical pooling method to obtain document embedding.

To determine cause-effect relationships in the absence of a randomized trial, we can model causal systems with counterfactuals and interventions given enough domain knowledge. However, there are several cases where domain knowledge is almost absent and the only recourse is using a statistical method to estimate causal relationships. While there have been several works done in estimating causal relationships in unstructured data, we are yet to find a well-defined framework for estimating causal relationships in Knowledge Graphs (KG). It is commonly used to provide a semantic framework for data with complex inter-domain relationships. In this work, we define a hybrid approach that allows us to discover cause-effect relationships in KG. The proposed approach is based around the finding of the instantaneous causal structure of a non-experimental matrix using a non-Gaussian model, i.e; finding the causal ordering of the variables in a non-Gaussian setting. The non-experimental matrix is a low-dimensional tensor projection obtained by decomposing the adjacency tensor of a KG. We use two different pre-existing algorithms, one for the causal discovery and the other for decomposing the KG and combining them to get the causal structure in a KG.",

        "abstract": "Since language models are used to model a wide variety of languages, it is natural to ask whether the neural architectures used for the task have inductive biases towards modeling particular types of languages. Investigation of these biases has proved complicated due to the many variables that appear in the experimental setup. Languages vary in many typological dimensions, and it is difficult to single out one or two to investigate without the others acting as confounders. We propose a novel method for investigating the inductive biases of language models using artificial languages. These languages are constructed to allow us to create parallel corpora across languages that differ only in the typological feature being investigated, such as word order. We then use them to train and test language models. This constitutes a fully controlled causal framework, and demonstrates how grammar engineering can serve as a useful tool for analyzing neural models. Using this method, we find that commonly used neural architectures exhibit different inductive biases: LSTMs display little preference with respect to word ordering, while transformers display a clear preference for some orderings over others. Further, we find that neither the inductive bias of the LSTM nor that of the transformer appears to reflect any tendencies that we see in attested natural languages.",

In light of this steady progress, can we claim that the performance gap between the two is closed? Starting from this question, we present a systematic comparison between state-of-the-art systems representative of the two paradigms. Focusing on three language directions (English-German/Italian/Spanish), we conduct automatic and manual evaluations, exploiting high-quality professional post-edits and annotations. Our multi-faceted analysis on one of the few publicly available ST benchmarks attests for the first time that: i) the gap between the two paradigms is now closed, and ii) the subtle differences observed in their behavior are not sufficient for humans neither to distinguish them nor to prefer one over the other.",

Here, we show that in ferromagnetic solids the effective SOC and the orbital magnetic moment can be dramatically enhanced by a factor of $1/[1-(2U^\\prime-U-J_H)\\rho_0]$, where $U$ and $U^\\prime$ are the on-site Coulomb interaction within the same oribtals and between different orbitals, respectively, $J_H$ is the Hund coupling, and $\\rho_0$ is the average density of states. This factor is obtained by using the two-orbital as well as five-orbital Hubbard models with SOC. We also find that the spin polarization is more favorable than the orbital polarization, being consistent with experimental observations. This present work provides a fundamental basis for understanding the enhancements of SOC and orbital moment by Coulomb interactions in ferromagnets, which would have wide applications in spintronics.",

In this case, to apply multi-objective reinforcement learning, the expected utility of the returns must be optimised. Various scenarios exist where a user's preferences over objectives (also known as the utility function) are unknown or difficult to specify. In such scenarios, a set of optimal policies must be learned. However, settings where the expected utility must be maximised have been largely overlooked by the multi-objective reinforcement learning community and, as a consequence, a set of optimal solutions has yet to be defined. In this paper we address this challenge by proposing first-order stochastic dominance as a criterion to build solution sets to maximise expected utility. We also propose a new dominance criterion, known as expected scalarised returns (ESR) dominance, that extends first-order stochastic dominance to allow a set of optimal policies to be learned in practice. We then define a new solution concept called the ESR set, which is a set of policies that are ESR dominant. Finally, we define a new multi-objective distributional tabular reinforcement learning (MOT-DRL) algorithm to learn the ESR set in a multi-objective multi-armed bandit setting.",

The series of observed spectral features consist of different emission lines associated with Pb-related defects. Finally, a room-temperature investigation of single-photon emitters under 490.5 nm laser excitation is reported, revealing different spectral signatures with respect to those already reported under 514 nm excitation. This work represents a substantial progress with respect to previous studies on Pb-related color centers, both in the attribution of an articulated series of spectral features and in the understanding of the formation process of this type of defect, thus clarifying the potential of this system for high-impact applications in quantum technologies.",

In this paper we prove their conjecture, thereby substantially increasing our understanding of these orders. This result also has ramifications in the representation theory of algebras, as established in previous work of the author. Indeed, it means that the two corresponding orders on tilting modules, cluster-tilting objects and their maximal chains are equal for the higher Auslander algebras of type $A$.",

Nevertheless, the properties of these languages are often not well represented by those available during training. Hence, we argue that the i.i.d. assumption ingrained in MAML makes it ill-suited for cross-lingual NLP. In fact, under a decision-theoretic framework, MAML can be interpreted as minimising the expected risk across training languages (with a uniform prior), which is known as Bayes criterion. To increase its robustness to outlier languages, we create two variants of MAML based on alternative criteria: Minimax MAML reduces the maximum risk across languages, while Neyman-Pearson MAML constrains the risk in each language to a maximum threshold. Both criteria constitute fully differentiable two-player games. In light of this, we propose a new adaptive optimiser solving for a local approximation to their Nash equilibrium. We evaluate both model variants on two popular NLP tasks, part-of-speech tagging and question answering. We report gains for their average and minimum performance across low-resource languages in zero- and few-shot settings, compared to joint multi-source transfer and vanilla MAML.",

In this paper we explore the relation between the local measurement uncertainties and the magnitude of the correlations by preparing polarization entangled photon pairs and performing joint measurements of non-commuting polarization components at different uncertainty trade-offs. The change in measurement visibility reveals the existence of a non-trivial balance between the measurement uncertainties where the probabilities of a specific pair of measurement outcomes approaches zero because of the particular combination of enhancement and suppression of the experimentally observed correlations. The occurrence of these high-contrast results shows that the quantum correlations between the photons are close to their maximal value, confirming that the Cirel'son bound of Bell's inequality violations is defined by the minimal uncertainties that limit the precision of joint measurements.",

We show that the concurrent action of an SOT pulse and an MTJ bias pulse allows for reducing the critical switching energy below the level typical of spin transfer torque while preserving the ability to switch the MTJ on the sub-ns time scale. By performing dc and real-time electrical measurements, we discriminate and quantify three effects arising from the MTJ bias: the voltage-controlled change of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, current-induced heating, and the spin transfer torque. The experimental results are supported by micromagnetic modeling. We observe that, depending on the pulse duration and the MTJ diameter, different effects take a lead in assisting the SOTs in the magnetization reversal process. Finally, we present a compact model that allows for evaluating the impact of each effect due to the MTJ bias on the critical switching parameters. Our results provide input to optimize the switching of three-terminal devices as a function of time, size, and material parameters.",

One of the major challenges in this field is precise detection and extraction of building information through Computer Vision techniques. Edge detection is one of the building blocks operations for many feature extraction solutions in Computer Vision. AR systems use edge detection for building extraction or for extraction of facade details from buildings. In this paper, we propose a novel filter operator for edge detection that aims to extract building contours or facade features better. The proposed filter gives more weight for finding vertical and horizontal edges that is an important feature for our aim.",

For this purpose, methods for the standardized description and identification of the aggregated flexibility potential of distribution grids are developed. Approaches for identifying the feasible operation region (FOR) of distribution grids can be categorized into two main classes: Random sampling/stochastic approaches and optimization-based approaches. While the latter have the advantage of working in real-world scenarios where no full grid models exist, when relying on naive sampling strategies, they suffer from poor coverage of the edges of the FOR due to convoluted distributions. In this paper, we tackle the problem from two different angles. First, we present a random sampling approach which mitigates the convolution problem by drawing sample values from a multivariate Dirichlet distribution. Second, we come up with a hybrid approach which solves the underlying optimal power flow problems of the optimization-based approach by means of a stochastic evolutionary optimization algorithm codenamed REvol. By means of synthetic feeders, we compare the two proposed FOR identification methods with regard to how well the FOR is covered and number of power flow calculations required.",

Furthermore, we show that nanoparticle heating in microfluidic environments, where nanoparticles experience free rotations, strongly depends on the particle orientation with respect to the illumination source, a variable often neglected in photothermal applications. We conclude that heating of nanodoughnuts depends weakly on orientation and therefore, are foreseen ideal candidates for photothermal therapy applications. Finally, we present a nanodoughnut fabrication guide, covering a wide range of toroid designs, which can help on its experimental implementation.",

We find that to be the case, albeit to different degrees, for three distinct PLM architectures. However, causes do not always need to be implicit -- when a cause is explicitly stated in a subordinate clause, an incongruent IC bias associated with the verb in the main clause leads to a delay in human processing. We hypothesize that the temporary challenge humans face in integrating the two contradicting signals, one from the lexical semantics of the verb, one from the sentence-level semantics, would be reflected in higher error rates for models on tasks dependent on causal links. The results of our study lend support to this hypothesis, suggesting that PLMs tend to prioritize lexical patterns over higher-order signals.",

Although restoring and maintaining consistency is desired in general, recent work has pointed out that always strictly enforcing consistency at any point of time is often not feasible in real-world scenarios, and sometimes even contrary to what a user expects from a trustworthy MDE tool. The challenge of tolerating inconsistencies has been discussed from different viewpoints within and outside the modelling community, but there exists no structured overview of existing and current work in this regard. In this paper, we provide such an overview to help join forces tackling the unresolved problems of tolerating inconsistencies in MDE. We follow the standard process of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to point out what tolerance means, how it relates to uncertainty, which examples for tolerant software systems have already been discussed, and which benefits and drawbacks tolerating inconsistencies entails. Furthermore, we propose a tool-chain that helps conducting SLRs in computer science and also eases the reproduction of results. Relevant meta-data of the collected sources is uniformly described in a textual modelling language and exported to the graph database Neo4j to query aggregated information.",

While appropriate when reading an individual text, this rhetorical device limits accessibility when browsing many texts (e.g., on a search engine or on social media). In these scenarios, an explicit conclusion makes for a good candidate summary of an argumentative text. This is especially true if the conclusion is informative, emphasizing specific concepts from the text. With this paper we introduce the task of generating informative conclusions: First, Webis-ConcluGen-21 is compiled, a large-scale corpus of 136,996 samples of argumentative texts and their conclusions. Second, two paradigms for conclusion generation are investigated; one extractive, the other abstractive in nature. The latter exploits argumentative knowledge that augment the data via control codes and finetuning the BART model on several subsets of the corpus. Third, insights are provided into the suitability of our corpus for the task, the differences between the two generation paradigms, the trade-off between informativeness and conciseness, and the impact of encoding argumentative knowledge. The corpus, code, and the trained models are publicly available.",

Despite achieving good performance on some public benchmarks, existing text-to-SQL models typically rely on the lexical matching between words in natural language (NL) questions and tokens in table schemas, which may render the models vulnerable to attacks that break the schema linking mechanism. In this work, we investigate the robustness of text-to-SQL models to synonym substitution. In particular, we introduce Spider-Syn, a human-curated dataset based on the Spider benchmark for text-to-SQL translation. NL questions in Spider-Syn are modified from Spider, by replacing their schema-related words with manually selected synonyms that reflect real-world question paraphrases. We observe that the accuracy dramatically drops by eliminating such explicit correspondence between NL questions and table schemas, even if the synonyms are not adversarially selected to conduct worst-case adversarial attacks. Finally, we present two categories of approaches to improve the model robustness. The first category of approaches utilizes additional synonym annotations for table schemas by modifying the model input, while the second category is based on adversarial training. We demonstrate that both categories of approaches significantly outperform their counterparts without the defense, and the first category of approaches are more effective.",

        "abstract": "The exchange stiffness is a central material parameter of all ferromagnetic materials. Its value controls the Curie temperature as well as the dynamic properties of spin waves to a large extend. Using ultrashort spin current pulses we excite perpendicular standing spin waves (PSSW) in ultrathin epitaxial iron layers at frequencies of up to 2.4 THz. Our analysis shows that for the PSSWs the observed exchange stiffness of iron is about 20% smaller compared to the established iron bulk value. In addition, we find an interface-related reduction of the effective exchange stiffness for layers with the thickness below 10 nm. To understand and discuss the possible mechanisms of the exchange stiffness reduction we develop an analytical 1D-model. In doing so we find that the interface induced reduction of the exchange stiffness is mode-dependent.",

        "abstract": "We construct a class of topological field theories with Wess-Zumino term in spacetime dimensions $\\ge 2$ whose target space has a geometrical structure that suitably generalizes Poisson or twisted Poisson manifolds. Assuming a field content comprising a set of scalar fields accompanied by gauge fields of degree $(1,p-1,p)$ we determine a generic Wess-Zumino topological field theory in $p+1$ dimensions with background data consisting of a Poisson 2-vector, a $(p+1)$-vector $R$ and a $(p+2)$-form $H$ satisfying a specific geometrical condition that defines a $H$-twisted $R$-Poisson structure of order $p+1$. For this class of theories we demonstrate how a target space covariant formulation can be found by means of an auxiliary connection without torsion. Furthermore, we study admissible deformations of the generic class in special spacetime dimensions and find that they exist in dimensions 2, 3 and 4. The two-dimensional deformed field theory includes the twisted Poisson sigma model, whereas in three dimensions we find a more general structure that we call bi-twisted $R$-Poisson. This extends the twisted $R$-Poisson structure of order 3 by a non-closed 3-form and gives rise to a topological field theory whose covariant formulation requires a connection with torsion and includes a twisted Poisson sigma model in three dimensions as a special case. The relation of the corresponding structures to differential graded Q-manifolds based on the degree shifted cotangent bundle $T^{\\ast}[p]T^{\\ast}[1]M$ is discussed, as well as the obstruction to them being QP-manifolds due to the Wess-Zumino term.",

Using density-potential functional theory with systematic semiclassical approximations, we address the long-standing problem of itinerant ferromagnetism in realistic settings. We reveal a universal transition from the paramagnetic state at small repulsive interactions towards ferromagnetic density profiles at large interaction strengths, with intricate particle-number dependent phases in between. Building on quantum Monte Carlo results for uniform systems, we benchmark our simulations against Hartree-Fock calculations for a small number of trapped fermions. We thereby demonstrate that our employed corrections to the mean-field interaction energy and especially to the Thomas-Fermi kinetic energy functional are necessary for reliably predicting properties of trapped mesoscopic Fermi gases. The density patterns of the ground state survive at low finite temperatures and confirm the Stoner-type polarization behavior across a universal interaction parameter, albeit with substantial quantitative differences that originate in the trapping potential and the quantum-corrected kinetic energy. We also uncover a zoo of metastable configurations that are energetically comparable to the ground-state density profiles and are thus likely to be observed in experiments. We argue that our density-functional approach can be easily applied to interacting multi-component Fermi gases in general.",

We take the Born-Infeld black hole as a concrete example to study the interior dynamics beyond the event horizon. When the contribution from the scalar potential can be neglected, the asymptotic near-singularity takes a universal Kasner form.

The proposed test is a flexible, interpretable, and statistically rigorous tool for auditing whether exhibited biases are intrinsic to the algorithm or due to the randomness in the data. The statistical challenges, which may arise from multiple impact criteria that define group fairness and which are discontinuous on model parameters, are conveniently tackled by projecting the empirical measure onto the set of group-fair probability models using optimal transport. This statistic is efficiently computed using linear programming and its asymptotic distribution is explicitly obtained. The proposed framework can also be used to test for testing composite fairness hypotheses and fairness with multiple sensitive attributes. The optimal transport testing formulation improves interpretability by characterizing the minimal covariate perturbations that eliminate the bias observed in the audit.",

In this paper, we propose a Topic-Driven Knowledge-Aware Transformer to handle the challenges above. We firstly design a topic-augmented language model (LM) with an additional layer specialized for topic detection. The topic-augmented LM is then combined with commonsense statements derived from a knowledge base based on the dialogue contextual information. Finally, a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture fuses the topical and commonsense information, and performs the emotion label sequence prediction. The model has been experimented on four datasets in dialogue emotion detection, demonstrating its superiority empirically over the existing state-of-the-art approaches. Quantitative and qualitative results show that the model can discover topics which help in distinguishing emotion categories.",

This extends the well-studied task of fact verification by providing a mechanism to correct written texts that are refuted or only partially supported by evidence. We demonstrate that it is feasible to train factual error correction systems from existing fact checking datasets which only contain labeled claims accompanied by evidence, but not the correction. We achieve this by employing a two-stage distant supervision approach that incorporates evidence into masked claims when generating corrections. Our approach, based on the T5 transformer and using retrieved evidence, achieved better results than existing work which used a pointer copy network and gold evidence, producing accurate factual error corrections for 5x more instances in human evaluation and a .125 increase in SARI score. The evaluation is conducted on a dataset of 65,000 instances based on a recent fact verification shared task and we release it to enable further work on the task.",

        "abstract": "Surface brightness-colour relations (SBCRs) are widely used for estimating angular diameters and deriving stellar properties. They are critical to derive extragalactic distances of early-type and late-type eclipsing binaries or, potentially, for extracting planetary parameters of late-type stars hosting planets. Various SBCRs have been implemented so far, but strong discrepancies in terms of precision and accuracy still exist in the literature. We aim at developing a precise SBCR for B- and A- early-type stars using selection criteria based on stellar characteristics and combined with homogeneous interferometric angular diameter measurements. We also improve SBCRs for late-type stars, in particular in the Gaia photometric band. We observed 18 early-type stars with the VEGA instrument, installed on the CHARA array. We then apply additional criteria on the photometric measurements, together with stellar characteristics diagnostics in order to build the SBCRs. We calibrate a SBCR for sub-giant and dwarf early-type stars. The RMS of the relation is $\\sigma_{F_{V_{0}}} = 0.0051\\,$mag, leading to an average precision of 2.3% on the estimation of angular diameters, with 3.1% for $V-K < -0.2\\,$mag and 1.8% for $V-K > -0.2\\,$mag. We found that the conversion between Johnson-$K$ and 2MASS-$K_s$ photometries is a key issue for early-type stars. Following this result, we have revisited our previous SBCRs for late-type stars by calibrating them with either converted Johnson-$K$ or 2MASS-$K_s$ photometries. We also improve the calibration of these SBCRs based on the Gaia photometry. The expected precision on the angular diameter using our SBCRs for late-type stars ranges from 1.0% to 2.7%. By reaching a precision of 2.3% on the estimation of angular diameters for early-type stars, a significant progress is done to determine extragalactic distances using early-type eclipsing binaries.",

However, existing works are unable to support database queries, such as \"List/Count all female athletes who were born in 20th century\", which require reasoning over sets of relevant facts with operations such as join, filtering and aggregation. We show that while state-of-the-art transformer models perform very well for small databases, they exhibit limitations in processing noisy data, numerical operations, and queries that aggregate facts. We propose a modular architecture to answer these database-style queries over multiple spans from text and aggregating these at scale. We evaluate the architecture using WikiNLDB, a novel dataset for exploring such queries. Our architecture scales to databases containing thousands of facts whereas contemporary models are limited by how many facts can be encoded. In direct comparison on small databases, our approach increases overall answer accuracy from 85% to 90%. On larger databases, our approach retains its accuracy whereas transformer baselines could not encode the context.",

During its fourth and fifth solar encounters, PSP had the same orbital trajectory, meaning that solar wind was measured at the same latitudes and radial distances. We identify two streams measured at the same heliocentric distance ($\\sim$0.13au) and latitude ($\\sim$-3.5$^{\\circ}$) across these encounters to reduce spatial evolution effects. By comparing the plasma of each stream, we confirm that they are not dominated by variable transient events, despite PSP's proximity to the heliospheric current sheet. Both streams are consistent with a previous slow Alfv\u00e9nic solar wind study once radial effects are considered, and appear to originate at the Southern polar coronal hole boundary. We also show that the switchback properties are not distinctly different between these two streams. Low $\\alpha$-particle abundance ($\\sim$ 0.6 %) is observed in the encounter 5 stream, suggesting that some physical mechanism must act on coronal hole boundary wind to cause $\\alpha$-particle depletion. Possible explanations for our observations are discussed, but it remains unclear whether the depletion occurs during the release or the acceleration of the wind. Using a flux tube argument, we note that an $\\alpha$-particle abundance of $\\sim$ 0.6 % in this low velocity wind could correspond to an abundance of $\\sim$ 0.9 % at 1 au. Finally, as the two streams roughly correspond to the spatial extent of a switchback patch, we suggest that patches are distinct features of coronal hole wind.",

        "abstract": "It is well known that active galactic nuclei (AGN) show various forms of interaction with their host galaxy, in a number of phenomena generally called AGN feedback. In particular, the relativistic plasma jets launched by a fraction of AGN can strongly affect their environment. We present here a study of the [O III] $\\lambda\\lambda$4959,5007 lines in a diverse sample of early evolution stage AGN -- specifically narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. Radio imaging observations of all of the sources enable a division to jetted and non-jetted sources, and exploiting this we show that the ionized gas properties are significantly influenced by the presence of the jets, as we often find the [O III] lines (blue-)shifted with respect to their restframe wavelength. We also show how the radio morphology and the radio spectral index do not seem to play a role in the origin of the [O III] shifts, thus suggesting that the source inclination is not relevant to the lines displacement. We do not find a strong relation between the [O III] line properties and the bolometric luminosity, suggesting that within our sample radiatively driven outflows do not seem to have a significant contribution to the [O III] line kinematics. We finally suggest that [O~ III] shifts may be a good proxy to identify the presence of relativistic jets. Additional studies, especially with integral-field spectroscopy, will provide a deeper insight into the relation between jets and their environment in early evolution stage AGN.",

Most natural dynamics are expressed by PDEs with varying coefficients (PDEs-VC), which highlights the importance of PDE discovery. Previous algorithms can discover some simple instances of PDEs-VC but fail in the discovery of PDEs with coefficients of higher complexity, as a result of coefficient estimation inaccuracy. In this paper, we propose KO-PDE, a kernel optimized regression method that incorporates the kernel density estimation of adjacent coefficients to reduce the coefficient estimation error. KO-PDE can discover PDEs-VC on which previous baselines fail and is more robust against inevitable noise in data. In experiments, the PDEs-VC of seven challenging spatiotemporal scientific datasets in fluid dynamics are all discovered by KO-PDE, while the three baselines render false results in most cases. With state-of-the-art performance, KO-PDE sheds light on the automatic description of natural phenomenons using discovered PDEs in the real world.",

The proportional weights algorithm has recently received interest in the theoretical literature where it was shown to have strong guarantees beyond the worst-case model of algorithms augmented with predictions. We extend these results to the case where the advertisers' capacities are no longer stationary over time.

Especially, for conventional optimization methods like sequential quadratic constrained quadratic programming (SQCQP) the formulation of the incremental control variables like in-phase and quadrature voltage controlled transformers in a solver suitable way is complex. Compared to this, the implementation of these control variables within heuristic approaches like the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is simple but problem specific adaptations of the classic PSO algorithm are necessary to avoid an unfortunate swarm behavior and local convergence in bad results. The objective of this paper is to introduce a SQCQP and a modified PSO approach in detail to solve the SCOPF problem adequately under consideration of flexible incremental in-phase and quadrature transformers tap sets and to compare and benchmark the results of both approaches for an adapted IEEE 118-bus system. The casestudy shows that both approaches lead to suitable results of the SCOPF with individual advantages of the SQCQP concerning the quality and the reproducibility of the results while the PSO lead to faster solutions when the complexity of the investigation scenario increases.",

In each of these events, grains exchange electrical charge via triboelectric effects. This enhances the stability of particle aggregates. Aim. Dielectric grains are easily charged by collisions. Here, we investigate whether a charge is capable of inducing an aggregation of particles and we consider how collision properties, such as ticking velocities and collisional cross-sections, are altered. Methods. We explored aggregation in microgravity experiments based on the observation of the motion of submillimeter (submm) grains following many collisions. In the process, grains attract each other, collide, stick, and ultimately form small aggregates. Results. We observed a bottom-up formation of irregular aggregates from submm grains. While some of the observed trajectories during the approach of grains reflect the presence of a pure Coulomb potential, the motion is not always in agreement with pure Kepler motion. Higher-order potentials of multipole charge distributions stand as a plausible explanation for this behavior. An immediate consequence of charging is that the particles continue to stick to each other at velocities of $\\sim 10 \\, \\rm cm/s,$ while surface forces of neutral grains are only expected to allow sticking below $\\sim 1 \\, \\rm mm/s$. No bouncing collision was observed among hundreds of collisions in the given parameter range. Applied to early phases of planet formation, the forming aggregates are therefore the first steps in a new growth phase beyond the traditional bouncing barrier in planet formation.",

We compare the final state population computed by the model to results obtained by numerical propagation of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation (TDSE) for the hydrogen atom. While we find qualitative agreement in the CEP dependence of the populations in principal quantum numbers, $n$, the populations to individual angular momentum channels, $\\ell$, are found to be inconsistent between model and TDSE.

However, there is a lack of empirical knowledge about this rising genre in quantitative science studies, particularly from the perspective of its linguistic features. To fill this gap, this research aims to offer a first quantitative examination of which rhetorical moves-rhetorical units performing a coherent narrative function-are used in data paper abstracts, as well as how these moves are used. To this end, we developed a new classification scheme for rhetorical moves in data paper abstracts by expanding a well-received system that focuses on English-language research article abstracts. We used this expanded scheme to classify and analyze rhetorical moves used in two flagship data journals, Scientific Data and Data in Brief. We found that data papers exhibit a combination of IMRaD- and data-oriented moves and that the usage differences between the journals can be largely explained by journal policies concerning abstract and paper structure. This research offers a novel examination of how the data paper, a novel data-oriented knowledge representation, is composed, which greatly contributes to a deeper understanding of data and data publication in the scholarly communication system.",

We assume that the channel matrix is spatially correlated and not perfectly known. We use the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) method to estimate the channel matrix. The asymptotic approximations of the MSE and BER enable us to solve various practical optimisation problems.

However, each data point in the dataset does not have the same potential, as some of the data points can be more representative or informative than others. This unequal importance among the data points may have a large impact in rehearsal-based continual learning, where we store a subset of the training examples (coreset) to be replayed later to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. In continual learning, the quality of the samples stored in the coreset directly affects the model's effectiveness and efficiency. The coreset selection problem becomes even more important under realistic settings, such as imbalanced continual learning or noisy data scenarios. To tackle this problem, we propose Online Coreset Selection (OCS), a simple yet effective method that selects the most representative and informative coreset at each iteration and trains them in an online manner. Our proposed method maximizes the model's adaptation to a target dataset while selecting high-affinity samples to past tasks, which directly inhibits catastrophic forgetting. We validate the effectiveness of our coreset selection mechanism over various standard, imbalanced, and noisy datasets against strong continual learning baselines, demonstrating that it improves task adaptation and prevents catastrophic forgetting in a sample-efficient manner.",

We formulate the scheduling process of JSSP as a sequential decision-making problem with graph representation of the state to consider the structure of JSSP. In solving the formulated problem, the proposed framework employs a GNN to learn that node features that embed the spatial structure of the JSSP represented as a graph (representation learning) and derive the optimum scheduling policy that maps the embedded node features to the best scheduling action (policy learning). We employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based RL strategy to train these two modules in an end-to-end fashion. We empirically demonstrate that the GNN scheduler, due to its superb generalization capability, outperforms practically favored dispatching rules and RL-based schedulers on various benchmark JSSP. We also confirmed that the proposed framework learns a transferable scheduling policy that can be employed to schedule a completely new JSSP (in terms of size and parameters) without further training.",

We build on the recent work exploring the interpretability of attention; we design a set of experiments to help us understand how sparsity affects our ability to use attention as an explainability tool. On three text classification tasks, we verify that only a weak relationship between inputs and co-indexed intermediate representations exists -- under sparse attention and otherwise. Further, we do not find any plausible mappings from sparse attention distributions to a sparse set of influential inputs through other avenues. Rather, we observe in this setting that inducing sparsity may make it less plausible that attention can be used as a tool for understanding model behavior.",

Existing state-of-the-art methods exploit motion clues to assist in short-term temporal modeling through temporal difference over consecutive frames. However, background noises will be inevitably introduced due to the camera movement. Besides, movements of different actions can vary greatly. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Saliency Integration (TSI) block, which mainly contains a Salient Motion Excitation (SME) module and a Cross-scale Temporal Integration (CTI) module. Specifically, SME aims to highlight the motion-sensitive area through local-global motion modeling, where the background suppression and pyramidal feature difference are conducted successively between neighboring frames to capture motion dynamics with less background noises. CTI is designed to perform multi-scale temporal modeling through a group of separate 1D convolutions respectively. Meanwhile, temporal interactions across different scales are integrated with attention mechanism. Through these two modules, long short-term temporal relationships can be encoded efficiently by introducing limited additional parameters. Extensive experiments are conducted on several popular benchmarks (i.e., Something-Something v1 & v2, Kinetics-400, UCF-101, and HMDB-51), which demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "For understanding the diversity of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) and especially the puzzling wide range in their radio-loudness, it is important to understand what role the magnetic fields play in setting the power of relativistic jets in AGN. We have performed multi-frequency (4-24 GHz) VLBA phase-referencing observations of the radio-intermediate quasar III Zw 2 using three nearby calibrators as reference sources to estimate jet magnetic flux by measuring the core-shift effect. By combining the self-referencing core-shift of each calibrator with the phase-referencing core-shifts, we obtained an upper limit of 0.16 mas for the core-shift between 4 and 24 GHz in III Zw 2. By assuming equipartition between magnetic and particle energy densities and adopting the flux-freezing approximation, we further estimated the upper limit for both magnetic field strength and poloidal magnetic flux threading the black hole. We find that the upper limit to the measured magnetic flux is smaller by at least a factor of five compared to the value predicted by the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) model. An alternative way to derive the jet magnetic field strength from the turnover of the synchrotron spectrum leads to an even smaller upper limit. Hence, the central engine of III Zw 2 has not reached the MAD state, which could explain why it has failed to develop a powerful jet, even though the source harbours a fast-spinning black hole. However, it generates an intermittent jet, which is possibly triggered by small scale magnetic field fluctuations as predicted by the magnetic flux paradigm of Sikora & Begelman (2013). We propose here that combining black hole spin measurements with magnetic field measurements from the VLBI core-shift observations of AGN over a range of jet powers could provide a strong test for the dominant factor setting the jet power relative to the accretion power available.",

However, NLP is language specific and for languages such as Dutch, NLP models are scarce. As a result, recent Dutch NLP models have a low capture of long range semantic dependencies over sentences. To overcome this, here we present belabBERT, a new Dutch language model extending the RoBERTa architecture. belabBERT is trained on a large Dutch corpus (+32 GB) of web crawled texts. We applied belabBERT to the classification of psychiatric illnesses. First, we evaluated the strength of text-based classification using belabBERT, and compared the results to the existing RobBERT model. Then, we compared the performance of belabBERT to audio classification for psychiatric disorders. Finally, a brief exploration was performed, extending the framework to a hybrid text- and audio-based classification. Our results show that belabBERT outperformed the current best text classification network for Dutch, RobBERT. belabBERT also outperformed classification based on audio alone.",

First we introduce a general distribution-dependent upper-bound on the excess risk, framed in terms of a natural notion of compressibility. This bound is independent of the dimension of the original data representation, and explains the in-built regularisation effect of the compressive approach. We then instantiate this general bound to classification and regression tasks, considering Johnson-Lindenstrauss mappings as the compression scheme. For each of these tasks, our strategy is to develop a tight upper bound on the compressibility function, and by doing so we discover distributional conditions of geometric nature under which the compressive algorithm attains minimax-optimal rates up to at most poly-logarithmic factors. In the case of compressive classification, this is achieved with a mild geometric margin condition along with a flexible moment condition that is significantly more general than the assumption of bounded domain. In the case of regression with strongly convex smooth loss functions we find that compressive regression is capable of exploiting spectral decay with near-optimal guarantees. In addition, a key ingredient for our central upper bound is a high probability uniform upper bound on the integrated deviation of dependent empirical processes, which may be of independent interest.",

Previous methods are typically node-centric and merely utilize different weight matrices to parameterize edge types, which 1) ignore the rich semantics embedded in the topological structure of edges, and 2) fail to distinguish local and non-local relations for each node. To this end, we propose a Line Graph Enhanced Text-to-SQL (LGESQL) model to mine the underlying relational features without constructing meta-paths. By virtue of the line graph, messages propagate more efficiently through not only connections between nodes, but also the topology of directed edges. Furthermore, both local and non-local relations are integrated distinctively during the graph iteration. We also design an auxiliary task called graph pruning to improve the discriminative capability of the encoder. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results (62.8% with Glove, 72.0% with Electra) on the cross-domain text-to-SQL benchmark Spider at the time of writing.",

In this work we apply techniques associated to this doubled geometry to four-dimensional manifolds, and we show that they are particularly well-suited to the analysis of integrability in special spacetimes, especially in connection with Penrose's twistor theory and its applications to general relativity. This shows a close relationship between some of the geometrical structures in the para-Hermitian approach to double field theory and those in algebraically special solutions to the Einstein equations. Particular results include the classification of four-dimensional, possibly complex-valued, (para-)Hermitian structures in different signatures, the Lie and Courant algebroid structures of special spacetimes, and the analysis of deformations of (para-)complex structures. We also discuss a notion of \"weighted algebroids\" in relation to a natural gauge freedom in the framework. Finally, we analyse the connection with two- and three-dimensional (real and complex) twistor spaces, and how the former can be understood in terms of the latter, in particular in terms of twistor families.",

        "abstract": "Existing reasoning tasks often have an important assumption that the input contents can be always accessed while reasoning, requiring unlimited storage resources and suffering from severe time delay on long sequences. To achieve efficient reasoning on long sequences with limited storage resources, memory augmented neural networks introduce a human-like write-read memory to compress and memorize the long input sequence in one pass, trying to answer subsequent queries only based on the memory. But they have two serious drawbacks: 1) they continually update the memory from current information and inevitably forget the early contents; 2) they do not distinguish what information is important and treat all contents equally. In this paper, we propose the Rehearsal Memory (RM) to enhance long-sequence memorization by self-supervised rehearsal with a history sampler. To alleviate the gradual forgetting of early information, we design self-supervised rehearsal training with recollection and familiarity tasks. Further, we design a history sampler to select informative fragments for rehearsal training, making the memory focus on the crucial information. We evaluate the performance of our rehearsal memory by the synthetic bAbI task and several downstream tasks, including text/video question answering and recommendation on long sequences.",

This marks the advent of a new, broader class of quantum circuits: dynamic quantum circuits. They offer a broader range of available computing primitives that lead to new challenges for design tasks such as simulation, compilation, and verification. Due to the non-unitary nature of dynamic circuit primitives, existing techniques for these tasks are no longer applicable in an out-of-the-box fashion. In this work, we discuss the resulting consequences for quantum circuit verification and present first ideas for corresponding automatic methods. More precisely, we propose two different schemes that eventually allow to treat the involved circuits as if they were not dynamic at all. By this, we provide a basis for applying existing techniques for quantum circuit verification to this broader class of circuits.",

However, radiotherapy systems usually have a latency inherent to robot control limitations that impedes the radiation delivery precision. Not taking this phenomenon into account may cause unwanted damage to healthy tissues and lead to side effects such as radiation pneumonitis. In this research, we use nine observation records of the three-dimensional position of three external markers on the chest and abdomen of healthy individuals breathing during intervals from 73s to 222s. The sampling frequency is equal to 10Hz and the amplitudes of the recorded trajectories range from 6mm to 40mm in the superior-inferior direction. We forecast the location of each marker simultaneously with a horizon value (the time interval in advance for which the prediction is made) between 0.1s and 2.0s, using a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained with unbiased online recurrent optimization (UORO). We compare its performance with an RNN trained with real-time recurrent learning, least mean squares (LMS), and offline linear regression. Training and cross-validation are performed during the first minute of each sequence. On average, UORO achieves the lowest root-mean-square (RMS) and maximum error, equal respectively to 1.3mm and 8.8mm, with a prediction time per time step lower than 2.8ms (Dell Intel core i9-9900K 3.60Ghz). Linear regression has the lowest RMS error for the horizon values 0.1s and 0.2s, followed by LMS for horizon values between 0.3s and 0.5s, and UORO for horizon values greater than 0.6s.",

We unveil a previously unrecognized regime: By increasing the nonlinearity, the system self-organizes into an incoherent localized structure that contains \"hidden\" coherent soliton states. The solitons are \"hidden\" in the sense that they are fully immersed in random wave fluctuations: The radius of the soliton is much larger than the correlation radius of the incoherent fluctuations while its peak amplitude is of the same order of such fluctuations. Accordingly, the solitons can hardly be identified in the usual spatial or spectral domains, while their existence is clearly unveiled in the phase-space representation. Our multi-scale theory based on coupled coherent-incoherent wave turbulence formalisms reveals that the hidden solitons are stabilized and trapped by the incoherent localized structure. Furthermore, hidden binary soliton systems are identified numerically and described theoretically. The regime of hidden solitons is of potential interest for self-gravitating Boson models of \"fuzzy\" dark matter. It also sheds new light on the quantum-to-classical correspondence with gravitational interactions. The hidden solitons can be observed in nonlocal nonlinear optics experiments through the measurement of the spatial spectrogram.",

        "abstract": "Local field potentials (LFPs) are signals that measure electrical activity in localized cortical regions from multiple implanted tetrodes in the human or animal brain. They can be treated as multivariate functional data (i.e., curves observed at many tetrodes spread across a patch on the surface of the cortex). Most multivariate functional data contain both global features (which are shared in common to all curves) as well isolated features (common only to a small subset of curves). The goal is this paper is to develop a procedure for capturing this common features. We propose a novel tree-structured functional principal component (filt-fPC) model through low-dimensional functional representation, specifically via filtration. A popular approach to dimension reduction of functional data is functional principal components analysis (fPCA). Ordinary fPCA can only capture the major information of one population, but fail to reveal the similarity of variation pattern of different groups, which is potentially related to functional connectivity of brain. One major advantage of the proposed filt-fPC method is the ability to extracting components that are common to multiple groups, and meanwhile preserves the idiosyncratic individual features of different groups, leading to a parsimonious and interpretable low dimensional representation of multivariate functional data. Another advantage is that the extracted functional principal components satisfy the orthonormal property for each set, making filt-fPC scores easy to be obtained. The proposed filt-fPC method was employed to study the impact of a shock (induced stroke) on the functional organization structure of the rat brain. Finally we point to further directions as this filtration idea can also be generalized to other functional statistical models, such as functional regression, classification and functional times series models.",

We describe the theoretical background of the method, and compare it to the quasi-kinematic test-field method (QKTFM), and to the previously studied variant working in simplified MHD (SMHD). We present several test cases using velocity and magnetic fields of the Roberts geometry, and also compare with the imposed-field method. We show that in all cases investigated, the CTFM gives results in agreement with the imposed field method. Some deviations between CTFM and SMHD variant exist. As a relevant physical application, we study non-helically forced shear flows, which exhibit large-scale dynamo (LSD) action, and present a re-analysis of low Reynolds number, moderate shear systems, where we previously neglected the pressure gradient in the momentum equation, and found no coherent shear-current effect. Another key difference is that in the earlier study we used magnetic forcing to mimic small-scale dynamo (SSD) action, while here it is self-consistently driven by purely kinetic forcing. We still find no coherent shear-current effect, but do recover strong large-scale dynamo (LSD) action, that, according to our analysis, is driven through the incoherent effects.",

Pin-SVM classifier deals with the pinball loss function, which has been defined in terms of the parameter $\\tau$. The parameter $\\tau$ can take values in $[ -1,1]$. The existing Pin-SVM model requires to solve the same optimization problem for all values of $\\tau$ in $[ -1,1]$. In this paper, we improve the existing Pin-SVM model for the binary classification task. At first, we note that there is major difficulty in Pin-SVM model (Huang et al. [1]) for $ -1 \\leq \\tau < 0$. Specifically, we show that the Pin-SVM model requires the solution of different optimization problem for $ -1 \\leq \\tau < 0$. We further propose a unified model termed as Unified Pin-SVM which results in a QPP valid for all $-1\\leq \\tau \\leq 1$ and hence more convenient to use. The proposed Unified Pin-SVM model can obtain a significant improvement in accuracy over the existing Pin-SVM model which has also been empirically justified by extensive numerical experiments with real-world datasets.",

The validation is both in simulation and on a fully-actuated robot hand (the Shadow Modular Grasper) fitted with custom-built optical tactile sensors (based on the BRL TacTip). The controller requires the orientations of the contact surfaces, which are estimated by regressing a deep convolutional neural network over the tactile images. Overall, the grasp system is demonstrated to achieve stable equilibrium poses on a range of objects varying in shape and softness, with the system being robust to perturbations and measurement errors. This approach also has promise to extend beyond grasping to stable in-hand object manipulation with multiple fingers.",

The proposed VQA framework consists of three modules, the feature extraction module, the quality regression module, and the quality pooling module. For the feature extraction module, we fuse the features from intermediate layers of the convolutional neural network (CNN) network into final quality-aware feature representation, which enables the model to make full use of visual information from low-level to high-level. Specifically, the structure and texture similarities of feature maps extracted from all intermediate layers are calculated as the feature representation for the full reference (FR) VQA model, and the global mean and standard deviation of the final feature maps fused by intermediate feature maps are calculated as the feature representation for the no reference (NR) VQA model. For the quality regression module, we use the fully connected (FC) layer to regress the quality-aware features into frame-level scores. Finally, a subjectively-inspired temporal pooling strategy is adopted to pool frame-level scores into the video-level score. The proposed model achieves the best performance among the state-of-the-art FR and NR VQA models on the Compressed UGC VQA database and also achieves pretty good performance on the in-the-wild UGC VQA databases.",

Existing automatic metrics are focused very much on the turn-level quality, while ignoring such dynamics. To this end, we propose DynaEval, a unified automatic evaluation framework which is not only capable of performing turn-level evaluation, but also holistically considers the quality of the entire dialogue. In DynaEval, the graph convolutional network (GCN) is adopted to model a dialogue in totality, where the graph nodes denote each individual utterance and the edges represent the dependency between pairs of utterances. A contrastive loss is then applied to distinguish well-formed dialogues from carefully constructed negative samples. Experiments show that DynaEval significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art dialogue coherence model, and correlates strongly with human judgements across multiple dialogue evaluation aspects at both turn and dialogue level.",

The eigen-energy spectrum of the system is obtained analytically, and the photon blockade effect is confirmed by numerically calculating the photon-number distributions and the equal-time second-order correlation function of the cavity field in the presence of system dissipations.

New applications have emerged, using small devices called sensor nodes capable of collecting data from the environment and processing it. However, more and more data are processed and transmitted with longer operational periods. At the same, the battery technologies have not improved fast enough to cope with these increasing needs. This makes the energy consumption issue increasingly challenging and thus, miniaturized energy harvesting devices have emerged to complement traditional energy sources. Nevertheless, the harvested energy fluctuates significantly during the node operation, increasing uncertainty in actually available energy resources. Recently, approaches in energy management have been developed, in particular using reinforcement learning approaches. However, in reinforcement learning, the algorithm's performance relies greatly on the reward function. In this paper, we present two contributions. First, we explore five different reward functions to identify the most suitable variables to use in such functions to obtain the desired behaviour. Experiments were conducted using the Q-learning algorithm to adjust the energy consumption depending on the energy harvested. Results with the five reward functions illustrate how the choice thereof impacts the energy consumption of the node. Secondly, we propose two additional reward functions able to find the compromise between energy consumption and a node performance using a non-fixed balancing parameter. Our simulation results show that the proposed reward functions adjust the node's performance depending on the battery level and reduce the learning time.",

The language is inspired by the aspect-oriented programming paradigm in modularizing instrumentation into separate transformers, that encapsulate joinpoint selection and advice inlining. BISM allows capturing joinpoints ranging from bytecode instructions to methods execution and provides comprehensive static and dynamic context information. It runs in two instrumentation modes: build-time and load-time. BISM also provides a mechanism to compose transformers and automatically detect their collision in the base program. Transformers in a composition can control the visibility of their advice and other instructions from the base program. We show several example applications for BISM and demonstrate its effectiveness using three experiments: a security scenario, a financial transaction system, and a general runtime verification case. The results show that BISM instrumentation incurs low runtime and memory overheads.",

        "abstract": "Disordered mechanical systems with high connectivity represent a limit opposite to the more familiar case of disordered crystals. Individual ions in a crystal are subjected essentially to nearest-neighbor interactions. In contrast, the systems studied in this paper have all their degrees of freedom coupled to each other. Thus, the problem of linearized small oscillations of such systems involves two full positive-definite and non-commuting matrices, as opposed to the sparse matrices associated with disordered crystals. Consequently, the familiar methods for determining the averaged vibrational spectra of disordered crystals, introduced many years ago by Dyson and Schmidt, are inapplicable for highly connected disordered systems. In this paper we apply random matrix theory to calculate the averaged vibrational spectra of such systems, in the limit of infinitely large system size. We calculate the average spectrum of the product of two positive definite random matrices by means of free probability theory techniques. We also show that this problem is intimately related with quasi-hermitian random matrix theory. The analytical results we obtain for the spectrum agree well with our numerical results. The latter also exhibit oscillations at the high-frequency band edge, which fit well the Airy kernel pattern. We also compute inverse participation ratios of the corresponding amplitude eigenvectors and demonstrate that they are all extended, in contrast with conventional disordered crystals. In addition to matrix model analysis, we study the vibrational spectra of various multi-segmented disordered pendula, as concrete realizations of highly connected mechanical systems. A universal feature of the density of vibration modes, common to both pendula and the matrix model, is that it tends to a non-zero constant at vanishing frequency.",

From the Koopman eigenvalues, we can judge the reversibility, determine the number of connected components in the state-transition network, evaluate the periods of asymptotic orbits, and derive the conserved quantities for each system.

This is a possible obstacle for the communications between the GP and kernel communities, making it difficult to transfer results from one side to the other. Our motivation is to remove this possible obstacle, by clarifying the connections between the sparse approximations for GPs and kernel methods. In this work, we study the two popular approaches, the Nystr\u00f6m and SVGP approximations, in the context of a regression problem, and establish various connections and equivalences between them. In particular, we provide an RKHS interpretation of the SVGP approximation, and show that the Evidence Lower Bound of the SVGP contains the objective function of the Nystr\u00f6m approximation, revealing the origin of the algebraic equivalence between the two approaches. We also study recently established convergence results for the SVGP and how they are related to the approximation quality of the Nystr\u00f6m method.",

Otherwise, it uses the inverse of the regularization two-sided projected Hessian matrix as the pre-conditioner to improve its robustness. Numerical results also show that the new method is more robust and faster than the traditional optimization method such as the sequential quadratic programming (SQP), the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the latest continuation method (Ptctr).

Spuriousness occurs when some features correlate with labels but are not causal; relying on such features prevents models from generalizing to unseen environments where such correlations break. In this work, we focus on image classification and propose two data generation processes to reduce spuriousness. Given human annotations of the subset of the features responsible (causal) for the labels (e.g. bounding boxes), we modify this causal set to generate a surrogate image that no longer has the same label (i.e. a counterfactual image). We also alter non-causal features to generate images still recognized as the original labels, which helps to learn a model invariant to these features. In several challenging datasets, our data generations outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy when spurious correlations break, and increase the saliency focus on causal features providing better explanations.",

The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) formalism can help tackle this problem. Its main goal is to seek an assignment (more generally a coupling matrix) that can register points across otherwise incomparable datasets. As a non-convex and quadratic generalization of optimal transport (OT), GW is NP-hard. Yet, heuristics are known to work reasonably well in practice, the state of the art approach being to solve a sequence of nested regularized OT problems. While popular, that heuristic remains too costly to scale, with cubic complexity in the number of samples $n$. We show in this paper how a recent variant of the Sinkhorn algorithm can substantially speed up the resolution of GW. That variant restricts the set of admissible couplings to those admitting a low rank factorization as the product of two sub-couplings. By updating alternatively each sub-coupling, our algorithm computes a stationary point of the problem in quadratic time with respect to the number of samples. When cost matrices have themselves low rank, our algorithm has time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(n)$. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method on simulated and real data.",

There is a substantial number of methods that aim at finding optimal initial seeds for $k$-Means, though none of them are universally valid. This paper presents an extension to longitudinal data of one of such methods, the BRIk algorithm, that relies on clustering a set of centroids derived from bootstrap replicates of the data and on the use of the versatile Modified Band Depth. In our approach we improve the BRIk method by adding a step where we fit appropriate B-splines to our observations and a resampling process that allows computational feasibility and handling issues such as noise or missing data. Our results with simulated and real data sets indicate that our $F$unctional Data $A$pproach to the BRIK method (FABRIk) is more effective than previous proposals at providing seeds to initialize $k$-Means in terms of clustering recovery.",

Consequently, they drew a lot of attention in the neuroimaging field in particular for phenotype prediction or computer-aided diagnosis. However, most of the current studies often deal with small single-site cohorts, along with a specific pre-processing pipeline and custom CNN architectures, which make them difficult to compare to. We propose an extensive benchmark of recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D CNN, evaluating also the benefits of data augmentation and deep ensemble learning, on both Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) pre-processing and quasi-raw images. Experiments were conducted on a large multi-site 3D brain anatomical MRI data-set comprising N=10k scans on 3 challenging tasks: age prediction, sex classification, and schizophrenia diagnosis. We found that all models provide significantly better predictions with VBM images than quasi-raw data. This finding evolved as the training set approaches 10k samples where quasi-raw data almost reach the performance of VBM. Moreover, we showed that linear models perform comparably with SOTA CNN on VBM data. We also demonstrated that DenseNet and tiny-DenseNet, a lighter version that we proposed, provide a good compromise in terms of performance in all data regime. Therefore, we suggest to employ them as the architectures by default. Critically, we also showed that current CNN are still very biased towards the acquisition site, even when trained with N=10k multi-site images. In this context, VBM pre-processing provides an efficient way to limit this site effect. Surprisingly, we did not find any clear benefit from data augmentation techniques. Finally, we proved that deep ensemble learning is well suited to re-calibrate big CNN models without sacrificing performance.",

Top-down approaches that learn NN potentials directly from experimental data have received less attention, typically facing numerical and computational challenges when backpropagating through MD simulations. We present the Differentiable Trajectory Reweighting (DiffTRe) method, which bypasses differentiation through the MD simulation for time-independent observables. Leveraging thermodynamic perturbation theory, we avoid exploding gradients and achieve around 2 orders of magnitude speed-up in gradient computation for top-down learning. We show effectiveness of DiffTRe in learning NN potentials for an atomistic model of diamond and a coarse-grained model of water based on diverse experimental observables including thermodynamic, structural and mechanical properties. Importantly, DiffTRe also generalizes bottom-up structural coarse-graining methods such as iterative Boltzmann inversion to arbitrary potentials. The presented method constitutes an important milestone towards enriching NN potentials with experimental data, particularly when accurate bottom-up data is unavailable.",

This paper is an attempt to introduce scientific rigour to the notion of flexibility in computing systems.",

Until recently, SEM software was either commercial or restricted to niche languages, and the lack of SEM packages compatible with more mainstream programming languages was dire. To combat that, we introduced a Python package semopy 1 that surpassed other state-of-the-art software in terms of performance and estimation accuracy. Yet, it was lacking in functionality and its usage was burdened with unnecessary boilerplate code. Here, we introduce a complete overhaul of semopy that improves upon the previous results and comes with lots of new capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel SEM model that combines in itself a notion of random effects from linear mixed models (LMMs) to model numerous phenomena, such as spatial data, time series or population stratification in genetics.",

We present our methods using benchmark examples for two and three degree of freedom Hamiltonian systems to illustrate the corresponding algorithm for this construction. Towards this end we use the normal form quadratic Hamiltonian system with two and three degrees of freedom. We found that the periodic orbit dividing surface can provide us the same dynamical information as the dividing surface constructed using normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds. This is significant because, in general, computations of normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds are very difficult in Hamiltonian systems with three or more degrees of freedom. However, our method avoids this computation and the only information that we need is the location of one periodic orbit.",

Here, we introduce a new variation of constrained DFT (CDFT), implemented in the wavelet-based BigDFT code, wherein the constraint corresponds to a particular transition (T) between occupied and virtual orbitals, rather than a region of the simulation space as in traditional CDFT. In this work, we perform benchmark T-CDFT calculations for a set of gas phase acene molecules and OLED emitters and compare them to $\\Delta$SCF and TDDFT results, for different functionals and basis sets. For both classes of molecules, we find that T-CDFT based on semi-local functionals is comparable to hybrid functional results from $\\Delta$SCF and TDDFT. Furthermore, T-CDFT proves to be more robust than $\\Delta$SCF and does not suffer from the well-known problems encountered when applying TDDFT to charge-transfer (CT) states, and is therefore equally applicable to both local excitations and CT states. Finally, since T-CDFT is designed for large systems and has been implemented in linear-scaling BigDFT, it is ideally suited for exploring the effects of explicit environments on excitation energies, paving the way for future simulations of excited states in complex realistic morphologies, such as those which occur in OLED materials.",

While our trained network provides competitive results in classical imaging regimes, most notably it also succeeds in the super-resolution regime where other comparable methods fail. This encompasses both (i) reconstruction of scatterers with sub-wavelength geometric features, and (ii) accurate imaging when two or more scatterers are separated by less than the classical diffraction limit. We demonstrate these properties are retained even in the presence of strong noise and extend to scatterers not previously seen in the training set. In addition, our network is straightforward to train requiring no restarts and has an online runtime that is an order of magnitude faster than optimization-based algorithms. We perform experiments with a variety of wave scattering mediums and we demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms both classical inversion and competing network architectures that specialize in oscillatory wave scattering data.",

Following reasonable procedures and using various support skills can help to effectively provide support.

In this paper, we define the Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) task and propose an ESC Framework, which is grounded on the Helping Skills Theory. We construct an Emotion Support Conversation dataset (ESConv) with rich annotation (especially support strategy) in a help-seeker and supporter mode. To ensure a corpus of high-quality conversations that provide examples of effective emotional support, we take extensive effort to design training tutorials for supporters and several mechanisms for quality control during data collection. Finally, we evaluate state-of-the-art dialog models with respect to the ability to provide emotional support. Our results show the importance of support strategies in providing effective emotional support and the utility of ESConv in training more emotional support systems.",

Canonical PSO hyperparameters are first tuned to prioritize exploration in early phase and exploitation in late phase. Next, a two-stage multi-swarm PSO (2SPSO) is used where multiple-swarms of the first stage collapse into a single swarm in the second stage. Finally, MS2PSO with multiple stages and multiple swarms is used in which swarms recursively collapse after each stage. Multiple swarm strategy ensures that diversity is retained within the population and multiple modes are explored. Staging ensures that local optima found during initial stage does not lead to premature convergence. Optimization test case comprises of 90 control variables and a twenty year period of flow simulation. It is observed that different algorithm designs have their own benefits and drawbacks. Multiple swarms and stages help algorithm to move away from local optima, but at the same time they may also necessitate larger number of iterations for convergence. Both 2SPSO and MS2PSO are found to be helpful for problems with high dimensions and multiple modes where greater degree of exploration is desired.",

A drawback of having more filters on an image sensor is a loss in spatial resolution which could be regained by using smaller pixels. However, this work shows that miniaturization causes a reduction in transmittance and requires a trade-off between pixel size and filter bandwidth. This is caused by diffraction and the reduced number of reflections in the filter. Analytical wave and ray optics models are developed and used for fast transmittance prediction and this is validated using a commercial spectral sensor and numerical simulations. The identified trade-off is an intrinsic limitation of pixel-integrated thin-film filter technology and the developed models will be useful tools for exploring new hardware and computational solutions.",

However, music information retrieval research has almost exclusively focused on single modality recognition, requiring development of separate models for each modality. Some multi-modal works require multiple coexisting modalities given to the model as inputs, constraining the use of these models to the few cases where data from all modalities are available. To the best of our knowledge, no existing model has the ability to take inputs from varying modalities, e.g. images or sounds, and classify them into unified music categories. We explore the use of cross-modal retrieval as a pretext task to learn modality-agnostic representations, which can then be used as inputs to classifiers that are independent of modality. We select instrument classification as an example task for our study as both visual and audio components provide relevant semantic information. We train music instrument classifiers that can take both images or sounds as input, and perform comparably to sound-only or image-only classifiers. Furthermore, we explore the case when there is limited labeled data for a given modality, and the impact in performance by using labeled data from other modalities. We are able to achieve almost 70% of best performing system in a zero-shot setting. We provide a detailed analysis of experimental results to understand the potential and limitations of the approach, and discuss future steps towards modality-agnostic classifiers.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel method to extract global and local features of functional time series. The global features concerning the dominant modes of variation over the entire function domain, and local features of function variations over particular short intervals within function domain, are both important in functional data analysis. Functional principal component analysis (FPCA), though a key feature extraction tool, only focus on capturing the dominant global features, neglecting highly localized features. We introduce a FPCA-BTW method that initially extracts global features of functional data via FPCA, and then extracts local features by block thresholding of wavelet (BTW) coefficients. Using Monte Carlo simulations, along with an empirical application on near-infrared spectroscopy data of wood panels, we illustrate that the proposed method outperforms competing methods including FPCA and sparse FPCA in the estimation functional processes. Moreover, extracted local features inheriting serial dependence of the original functional time series contribute to more accurate forecasts. Finally, we develop asymptotic properties of FPCA-BTW estimators, discovering the interaction between convergence rates of global and local features.",

        "abstract": "In computer vision and natural language processing, innovations in model architecture that lead to increases in model capacity have reliably translated into gains in performance. In stark contrast with this trend, state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often use only small MLPs, and gains in performance typically originate from algorithmic innovations. It is natural to hypothesize that small datasets in RL necessitate simple models to avoid overfitting; however, this hypothesis is untested. In this paper we investigate how RL agents are affected by exchanging the small MLPs with larger modern networks with skip connections and normalization, focusing specifically on soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithms. We verify, empirically, that na\u00efvely adopting such architectures leads to instabilities and poor performance, likely contributing to the popularity of simple models in practice. However, we show that dataset size is not the limiting factor, and instead argue that intrinsic instability from the actor in SAC taking gradients through the critic is the culprit. We demonstrate that a simple smoothing method can mitigate this issue, which enables stable training with large modern architectures. After smoothing, larger models yield dramatic performance improvements for state-of-the-art agents -- suggesting that more \"easy\" gains may be had by focusing on model architectures in addition to algorithmic innovations.",

Surprisingly, we observe no zero or even conventional exchange bias effect for the Ca and Sr doped single crystals, in sharp contrast to polycrystalline samples.

We can show that our approach is real-time capable on this benchmark and outperforms all other real-time capable approaches in HOTA, MOTA, and IDF1. We achieve this by contributing a fast Siamese network reformulated for linear runtime (instead of quadratic) to generate fingerprints from detections. Thus, it is possible to associate the detections to Kalman filters based on multiple tracking specific ratings: Cosine similarity of fingerprints, Intersection over Union, and pixel distance ratio in the image.",

The idea is to run unpatched and patched application instances concurrently, with the unpatched one having complete control and the output of the patched one being used only for comparison, to watch for differences that are consequences of introduced bugs. To test this idea, we developed a system that allows us to run web applications in parallel and tested three web applications. The experiments have shown that the idea is promising for web applications from the technical side. Furthermore, we discuss the potential limitations of this system and the idea in general, how long two instances should run in order to be able to claim with some probability that the patched version has not introduced any new bugs, other potential use cases of the proposed system where two application instances run concurrently, and finally the potential uses of this system with different types of applications, such as SCADA systems.",

From the Kadanoff-Baym approach we derive the off-shell Fokker-Planck equation which encodes the heavy-flavor transport coefficients. We analyze the thermal width (damping rate) of $D$ mesons due to their scattering off light mesons, focusing on new in-medium effects: off-shell corrections, inelastic channels, and the contribution of the Landau cut. We obtain that the latter effect (absent for vacuum scattering amplitudes) brings sizable corrections at moderate temperatures. We discuss how the heavy-flavor transport coefficients, like the drag and diffusion coefficients, are modified in matter. We find that the $D$-meson spatial diffusion coefficient matches smoothly to the latest results of lattice-QCD calculations and Bayesian analyses at higher temperatures.",

        "abstract": "Context. Dynamical and turbulent motions of gas in a protoplanetary disk are crucial for their evolution and affect planet formation. Recent observations suggest weak turbulence in the disk's outer regions. However, the physical mechanism of turbulence in these outer regions remains uncertain. The vertical shear instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism to produce turbulence in disks. Aims. Our aim is to study the observability of the gas velocity structure produced by the VSI via CO kinematics with ALMA. Methods. We perform global 3D hydrodynamical simulations of a VSI-unstable disk. We post-process the simulation results with radiative transfer calculations, and produce synthetic predictions of CO rotational emission lines. Following, we compute the line of sight velocity map, and its deviations from a sub-Keplerian equilibrium solution. We explore the detectability of the VSI by identifying kinematic signatures using realistic simulated observations. Results. Our 3D simulations of the VSI show the steady state dynamics of the gas in great detail. From the velocity structure we infer a turbulent stress value of $\\alpha_{r\\phi}=1.4 \\times 10^{-4}$. On large scales, we observe velocity deviations of 50 m s$^{-1}$ as axisymmetric rings. We find optimal conditions at $i \\lesssim 20^{\\circ}$ to trace for the kinematic structures of the VSI. We found that current diagnostics to constrain gas turbulence from non-thermal broadening of the line emission are not applicable to anisotropic VSI turbulence. Conclusions. The detection of kinematic signatures produced by the VSI is possible with ALMA. Observations including an extended antenna configuration combined with the highest spectral resolution available are needed for robust detection. The characterization of the large-scale velocity perturbations is required to constrain the turbulence level produced by the VSI from gas observations.",

In addition, we develop a general conceptual framework to compare and contrast the different results by proposing a three-step process. First, one specifies the setting and restrictions of the differential equation problem to be studied and identifies the relevant small parameters. Second, one defines a notion of equivalence via a property/observable for partitioning the parameter space into suitable regions near the singular limit. Third, one studies the possible asymptotic singular limit problems as well as perturbation results to complete the diagrammatic subdivision process. We illustrate this approach for two simple problems from algebra and analysis. Then we proceed to the review of several modern double-limit problems including multiple time scales, stochastic dynamics, spatial patterns, and network coupling. For each example, we illustrate the previously mentioned three-step process and show that already double-limit parametric diagrams provide an excellent unifying theme. After this review, we compare and contrast the common features among the different examples. We conclude with a brief outlook, how our methodology can help to systematize the field better, and how it can be transferred to a wide variety of other classes of differential equations.",

Creating new equilibrium configurations irrespective of the presence of a gravitational field is challenging with applications on earth as well as in zero-gravity environments. Vibrations are known to alter the shape of liquid interfaces and to also to change internal dynamics and stability in depth. Here, we show that vibrations can also create an \"artificial gravity\" in any direction. We demonstrate that a liquid can maintain an inclined interface when shaken in an arbitrary direction. A necessary condition for the equilibrium to occur is the existence of a velocity gradient determined by dynamical boundary conditions. However, no-slip boundary condition and incompressibility can perturb the required velocity profile leading to a destabilization of the equilibrium. We show that liquid layers provide a solution and liquid walls of several centimeters in height can thus be stabilized. We show that the buoyancy equilibrium is not affected by the forcing.",

Indeed, resorting to dynamic programming leads to an exponential growth of computing time, as the number of arms and the horizon increase. We introduce a decompositioncoordination heuristic, DeCo, that turns the initial problem into parallelly coordinated one-armed bandit problems. As a consequence, we obtain a computing time which is essentially linear in the number of arms. In addition, the decomposition provides a theoretical lower bound on the regret. For the two-armed bandit case, dynamic programming provides the exact solution, which is almost matched by the DeCo heuristic. Moreover, in numerical simulations with up to 100 rounds and 20 arms, DeCo outperforms classic algorithms (Thompson sampling and Kullback-Leibler upper-confidence bound) and almost matches the theoretical lower bound on the regret for 20 arms.",

Here, almost all means with the possible exception of a set of Dirichlet density zero. One of the results of this paper shows that the condition density zero can be improved to a specific positive density that depends solely in the degree of the fields. More specifically, for every positive $n$ we exhibit a positive constan $c_{n}$ such that any two degree $n$ number fields $K$ and $L$ are arithmetically equivalent if and only if the set of primes $p$ such that the arithmetic type of $p$ in $K$ and $L$ is not the same has Dirichlet density at most $c_n$. We in fact show that $\\displaystyle c_n=\\frac{1}{4n^2}$ works and give a heuristic evidence that points to the fact that this value might be improved to $\\displaystyle \\frac{2}{n^2}$. We also show that to check whether or not two number fields are arithmetically equivalent it is enough to check equality between finitely many coefficients of their zeta functions, and we give an upper bound for such number.",

In the telecommunication wavelength region (1520 to 1580 nm), the Sb$_2$S$_3$ directional coupler displays a minimum insertion loss of -0.04 dB and -1.1 dB, and the lowest crosstalk of -42 dB and -17 dB for the amorphous and crystalline states respectively. We also design a non-volatile 2-bit low-loss tuneable Sb$_2$S$_3$ directional coupler that can be used to set the weights of optical neural networks (ONN). Partial crystallization of Sb$_2$S$_3$ strips with dimensions compatible to those in the directional coupler indicate that at least four different crystalline lengths can be reliably programmed. We used this effect to design a 2-bit tuneable Sb$_2$S$_3$ directional coupler with a weight dynamic range close to 17 dB.

With the adopted temperature zero point from one of the works based on the infrared flux method, we find it necessary to increase the Gaia parallaxes by 0.02 mas to bring the RRd and Gaia luminosities into agreement. This value is consonant with those derived from studies on binary stars in the context of Gaia. We examine also the resulting period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relation in the 2MASS K band as follows from the RRd parameters. This leads to the verification of two independently derived other PLZs. No significant zero point differences are found. Furthermore, the predicted K absolute magnitudes agree within sigma=0.005-0.01mag.",

They also showed families of strings where the approximation ratio of the number of LZ-End phrases to the number of LZ77 phrases asymptotically approaches 2. However, the alphabet size of these strings is unbounded. In this paper, we analyze the LZ-End factorization of the period-doubling sequence.

In recent years, several ways are proposed such as algorithm level (internal) approaches, data level (external) techniques, and cost-sensitive methods. Although extensive research has been carried out on imbalanced data classification, however, several unsolved challenges remain such as no attention to the importance of samples to balance, determine the appropriate number of classifiers, and no optimization of classifiers in the combination of classifiers. The purpose of this paper is to improve the efficiency of the ensemble method in the sampling of training data sets, especially in the minority class, and to determine better basic classifiers for combining classifiers than existing methods. We proposed a hybrid ensemble algorithm based on Genetic Programming (GP) for two classes of imbalanced data classification. In this study uses historical data from UCI Machine Learning Repository to assess minority classes in imbalanced datasets. The performance of our proposed algorithm is evaluated by Rapid-miner studio v.7.5. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed method on the specified data sets in the size of the training set shows 40% and 50% better accuracy than other dimensions of the minority class prediction.",

This is done by handcrafting target spiking signals, which in turn implicitly fixes the mechanisms used to decode spikes into natural signals, e.g., rate decoding. The arbitrary choice of target signals and decoding rule generally impairs the capacity of the SNN to encode and process information in the timing of spikes. To address this problem, this work introduces a hybrid variational autoencoder architecture, consisting of an encoding SNN and a decoding Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The role of the decoding ANN is to learn how to best convert the spiking signals output by the SNN into the target natural signal. A novel end-to-end learning rule is introduced that optimizes a directed information bottleneck training criterion via surrogate gradients. We demonstrate the applicability of the technique in an experimental settings on various tasks, including real-life datasets.",

The rotation and vibration transitional theory seems to provide a better description of heavy tetraquarks than other attempts within the same formalism.

The oscillations are typically symmetric in the orientation of the applied magnetic flux. Using double InAs nanowires coated by an epitaxial superconducting Al shell which, despite the non-centro-symmetric geometry, behaves effectively as one hollow cylinder, we demonstrate that a small misalignment of the applied parallel field with respect to the axis of the nanowires can produce field-asymmetric Little-Parks oscillations. These are revealed by the simultaneous application of a magnetic field perpendicular to the misaligned parallel field direction. The asymmetry occurs in both the destructive regime, in which superconductivity is destroyed for half-integer quanta of flux through the shell, and in the non-destructive regime, where superconductivity is depressed but not fully destroyed at these flux values.",

This paper focuses on discovering challenges and defining models needed when trying to approach the problem of routing algorithmically. It provides an overview of relevant speedrunning literature, extracting vital information and formulating criticism. Important categorizations are pointed out and a nomenclature is build to support professional discussion. Different concepts of graph representations are presented and their potential is discussed with regard to solving the speedrun routing optimization problem. Visions both for problem modeling as well as solving are presented and assessed regarding suitability and expected challenges.

Existing techniques for tackling this issue require a learning process to re-train models with additional objectives and mostly employ a global assessment to study isotropy. Our quantitative analysis over isotropy shows that a local assessment could be more accurate due to the clustered structure of CWRs. Based on this observation, we propose a local cluster-based method to address the degeneration issue in contextual embedding spaces. We show that in clusters including punctuations and stop words, local dominant directions encode structural information, removing which can improve CWRs performance on semantic tasks. Moreover, we find that tense information in verb representations dominates sense semantics. We show that removing dominant directions of verb representations can transform the space to better suit semantic applications. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed cluster-based method can mitigate the degeneration problem on multiple tasks.",

Our formulation emulates, and is motivated by, problems involving noisy selection arising in the disciplines of stochastic simulation and simulation-based optimisation. In addition, we employ the philosophy of ordinal optimisation - involving an ordinal selection rule, and a percentile notion of goal softening for the success probability. As a result, it is shown that the success probability only depends on the underlying copula of the problem. Other general properties for the success probability are also presented. Specialising to the case of Gaussian copulas, we also derive an analytic lower bound for the success probability, which may then be inverted to find sufficiently large sample sizes that guarantee a high success probability arbitrarily close to one.",

While the problem of document-to-document similarity ranking has been studied, most modern methods are limited to relatively short documents or rely on the existence of \"ground-truth\" similarity labels. Yet, in most common real-world cases, similarity ranking is an unsupervised problem as similarity labels are unavailable. Moreover, an ideal model should not be restricted by documents' length. Hence, we introduce SDR, a self-supervised method for document similarity that can be applied to documents of arbitrary length. Importantly, SDR can be effectively applied to extremely long documents, exceeding the 4,096 maximal token limits of Longformer. Extensive evaluations on large document datasets show that SDR significantly outperforms its alternatives across all metrics. To accelerate future research on unlabeled long document similarity ranking, and as an additional contribution to the community, we herein publish two human-annotated test sets of long documents similarity evaluation. The SDR code and datasets are publicly available.",

Chains of magnetic impurities offer one of the most viable routes for the realization of Majorana bound states which hold a promise for topological quantum computing. However, this ambitious goal looks distant since no quantum coherent degrees of freedom have yet been identified in these systems. To fill this gap we propose an effective two-level system, a YSR qubit, stemming from two nearby impurities. Using a time-dependent wave-function approach, we derive an effective Hamiltonian describing the YSR qubit evolution as a function of distance between the impurity spins, their relative orientations, and their dynamics. We show that the YSR qubit can be controlled and read out using the state-of-the-art experimental techniques for manipulation of the spins. Finally, we address the effect of the spin noises on the coherence properties of the YSR qubit, and show a robust behaviour for a wide range of experimentally relevant parameters. Looking forward, the YSR qubit could facilitate the implementation of a universal set of quantum gates in hybrid systems where they are coupled to topological Majorana qubits.",

The location of the viscous damping are divided into two groups, characterized by whether both of the top and bottom layers are directly damped or otherwise. Each group consists of three cases.

These engines are composed of working systems with a finite number of quantum particles and are restricted to one-shot measurements. The engines operate in a one-step cycle by letting the working system simultaneously interact with hot and cold baths via semi-local thermal operations. By allowing quantum entanglement between its constituents and, thereby, a coherent transfer of heat from hot to cold baths, the engine implements the fastest possible reversible state transformation in each cycle, resulting in maximum power and Carnot efficiency. We propose a physically realizable engine using quantum optical systems.",

Previous studies have seldom adopted a systematic approach to understand the phenomenon responsible for the extreme events. Hence, this study intends to identify this dynamical phenomenon based on spectral methods, and attempts to render a preliminary solution to the problem. The study exposes the presence of westward-propagating high-frequency tropical atmospheric waves of 5-8 days period, which originated from east Indian Ocean or West Pacific and headed towards the east coast of Africa. The wave troughs ensured sufficient moisture availability along its path, causing extreme precipitation over Kerala on the way.",

It is seen that there are significant changes in the results to be addressed. In addition, I have also calculated the gravitational binding energy, causality and pulsational stability of the structures which were not considered in Negi et al. \\cite{Ref1} . The modified results have important consequences to model neutron stars and pulsars. The maximum neutron star mass obtained in this study corresponds to the mean value of the classical results obtained by Rhodes \\& Ruffini \\cite {Ref3} and the upper bound on neutron star mass obtained by Kalogera \\& Byam \\cite {Ref4} and is much closer to the most recent theoretical estimate made by Sotani \\cite{Ref5}. On one hand, when there are only few equations of state (EOSs) available in the literature which can fulfil the recent observational constraint imposed by the largest neutron star masses around 2$M_\\odot$\\cite{Ref6}, \\cite{Ref7}, \\cite{Ref8}, the present analytic models, on the other hand, can comfortably satisfy this constraint. Furthermore, the maximum allowed value of compactness parameter $u(\\equiv M/a$; mass to size ratio in geometrized units) $ \\leq 0.30$ obtained in this study is also consistent with an absolute maximum value of $ u_{\\rm max} = 0.333^{+0.001}_{-0.005}$ resulting from the observation of binary neutron stars merger GW170817 (see, e.g.\\cite{Ref9}).",

The stress is measured using eddy based sensors. Both the stress and strain are controlled by applying PID control loops on measured quantities and changing position using a micromanipulator. To get rid of surface tension forces, the sample and cantilever are immersed. This enables stress measurement and control down to 3mPa. With this apparatus, we can independently apply shear and normal stress, or strain, with same precision. We demonstrate the technical capability of the setup with steady shear strain or stress experiments on a soft protein gel system. The simultaneous confocal imaging offers insight into the macroscopic breaking observed in an increasing shear strain experiment.",

A common feature of these plasma systems is the need to resolve, in addition to velocity space, at least one physical dimension (e.g. along flux lines) to capture the relevant physics. In general, this requires a kinetic treatment. Fully kinetic Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations can be applied but at the expense of large computational effort. A common way to resolve this is to use a hybrid approach: kinetic ions and fluid electrons. In the present work, the development of a hybrid PIC computational tool suitable for open magnetic geometries is described which includes (1) the effect of non-uniform magnetic fields, (2) finite fully-absorbing boundaries for the particles and (3) volumetric particle sources. Analytical expressions for the momentum transport in the paraxial limit are presented with their underlying assumptions and are used to validate the results from the PIC simulations. The self-consistent electric field is calculated and is shown to modify the ion velocity distribution function in manner consistent with analytic theory. Based on this analysis, the ion distribution function is understood in terms of a loss-cone distribution and an isotropic Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution driven by a volumetric plasma source. Finally, inclusion of a Monte-Carlo based Fokker-Planck collision operator is discussed in the context of future work.",

Using delay lengths much shorter than the coherence length of the laser, the DSH trace reveals a correspondence with the FN power spectral density (PSD) measured with commercial instruments.

We tested this claim by exploring a single phenomenon in four languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, and Italian. While human behavior has been found to be similar across languages, we find cross-linguistic variation in model behavior. We show that competing processes in a language act as constraints on model behavior and demonstrate that targeted fine-tuning can re-weight the learned constraints, uncovering otherwise dormant linguistic knowledge in models. Our results suggest that models need to learn both the linguistic constraints in a language and their relative ranking, with mismatches in either producing non-human-like behavior.",

        "abstract": "Within the $\\Lambda$CDM model, measurements from recent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and weak lensing (WL) surveys have uncovered a $\\sim 3\\sigma$ disagreement in the inferred value of the parameter $S_8 \\equiv \\sigma_8\\sqrt{\\Omega_m/0.3}$, quantifying the amplitude of late-time matter fluctuations. Before questioning whether the $S_8$ discrepancy calls for new physics, it is important to assess the view of measurements other than CMB and WL ones on the discrepancy. Here, we examine the role of measurements of the growth rate $f(z)$ in arbitrating the $S_8$ discrepancy, considering measurements of $f\\sigma_8(z)$ from Redshift-Space Distortions (RSD). Our baseline analysis combines RSD measurements with geometrical measurements from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa), given the key role of the latter in constraining $\\Omega_m$. From this combination and within the $\\Lambda$CDM model we find $S_8 = 0.762^{+0.030}_{-0.025}$, and quantify the agreement between RSD+BAO+SNeIa and \\textit{Planck} to be at the $2.2\\sigma$ level: the mild disagreement is therefore compatible with a statistical fluctuation. We discuss combinations of RSD measurements with other datasets, including the $E_G$ statistic. This combination increases the discrepancy with \\textit{Planck}, but we deem it significantly less robust. Our earlier results are stable against an extension where we allow the dark energy equation of state $w$ to vary. We conclude that, from the point of view of combined growth rate and geometrical measurements, there are hints, but no strong evidence yet, for the \\textit{Planck} $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology over-predicting the amplitude of matter fluctuations at redshifts $z \\lesssim 1$. From this perspective, it might therefore still be premature to claim the need for new physics from the $S_8$ discrepancy.",

Here, we introduce the first end-to-end model for CD coreference resolution from raw text, which extends the prominent model for within-document coreference to the CD setting. Our model achieves competitive results for event and entity coreference resolution on gold mentions. More importantly, we set first baseline results, on the standard ECB+ dataset, for CD coreference resolution over predicted mentions. Further, our model is simpler and more efficient than recent CD coreference resolution systems, while not using any external resources.",

For nonlinear systems operating far away from equilibria, on the other hand, current approaches seek low-dimensional representations of the state that often neglect low-energy features that have high dynamical significance. For instance, low-energy features are known to play an important role in fluid dynamics where they can be a driving mechanism for shear-layer instabilities. Neglecting these features leads to models with poor predictive accuracy despite being able to accurately encode and decode states. In order to improve predictive accuracy, we propose to optimize the reduced-order model to fit a collection of coarsely sampled trajectories from the original system. In particular, we optimize over the product of two Grassmann manifolds defining Petrov-Galerkin projections of the full-order governing equations. We compare our approach with existing methods such as proper orthogonal decomposition and balanced truncation-based Petrov-Galerkin projection, and our approach demonstrates significantly improved accuracy both on a nonlinear toy model and on an incompressible (nonlinear) axisymmetric jet flow with 69,000 states.",

        "abstract": "Statisticians often face the choice between using probability models or a paradigm defined by minimising a loss function. Both approaches are useful and, if the loss can be re-cast into a proper probability model, there are many tools to decide which model or loss is more appropriate for the observed data, in the sense of explaining the data's nature. However, when the loss leads to an improper model, there are no principled ways to guide this choice. We address this task by combining the Hyv\u00e4rinen score, which naturally targets infinitesimal relative probabilities, and general Bayesian updating, which provides a unifying framework for inference on losses and models. Specifically we propose the H-score, a general Bayesian selection criterion and prove that it consistently selects the (possibly improper) model closest to the data-generating truth in Fisher's divergence. We also prove that an associated H-posterior consistently learns optimal hyper-parameters featuring in loss functions, including a challenging tempering parameter in generalised Bayesian inference. As salient examples, we consider robust regression and non-parametric density estimation where popular loss functions define improper models for the data and hence cannot be dealt with using standard model selection tools. These examples illustrate advantages in robustness-efficiency trade-offs and provide a Bayesian implementation for kernel density estimation, opening a new avenue for Bayesian non-parametrics.",

Our insight is to consider both sensitivity and similarity via our new local DP notion. The sanitized texts also contribute to our sanitization-aware pretraining and fine-tuning, enabling privacy-preserving natural language processing over the BERT language model with promising utility.

Whether the entity spans are nested or discontinuous, the NER task can be categorized into the flat NER, nested NER, and discontinuous NER subtasks. These subtasks have been mainly solved by the token-level sequence labelling or span-level classification. However, these solutions can hardly tackle the three kinds of NER subtasks concurrently. To that end, we propose to formulate the NER subtasks as an entity span sequence generation task, which can be solved by a unified sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) framework. Based on our unified framework, we can leverage the pre-trained Seq2Seq model to solve all three kinds of NER subtasks without the special design of the tagging schema or ways to enumerate spans. We exploit three types of entity representations to linearize entities into a sequence. Our proposed framework is easy-to-implement and achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) or near SoTA performance on eight English NER datasets, including two flat NER datasets, three nested NER datasets, and three discontinuous NER datasets.",

In particular, it has been observed experimentally that the signal undergoes not only molecular absorption, but also molecular re-radiation. Two extreme modeling assumptions are prevalent in the literature, where the re-radiated energy is modeled in the first as additive Gaussian noise and in the second as a scattered component strongly correlated to the actual signal. Since the exact characterization is still an open problem, we provide in this paper the first comparative study of the performance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted THz system under these two extreme models of re-radiation. In particular, we employ an RIS to overcome the large pathloss by creating a virtual line-of-sight (LOS) path. We then develop an optimization framework for this setup and utilize the block-coordinate descent (BCD) method to iteratively optimize both RIS configuration vector and receive beamforming weight resulting in significant throughput gains for the user of interest compared to random RIS configurations. As expected, our results reveal that better throughput is achieved under the scattering assumption for the molecular re-radiation than the noise assumption.",

        "abstract": "Semi-supervised training (SST) is a common approach to leverage untranscribed/unlabeled speech data to improve automatic speech recognition performance in low-resource languages. However, if the available unlabeled speech is mismatched to the target domain, SST is not as effective, and in many cases performs worse than the original system. In this paper, we address the issue of low-resource ASR when only untranscribed out-of-domain speech data is readily available in the target language. Specifically, we look to improve performance on conversational/telephony speech (target domain) using web resources, in particular YouTube data, which more closely resembles news/topical broadcast data. Leveraging SST, we show that while in some cases simply pooling the out-of-domain data with the training data lowers word error rate (WER), in all cases, we see improvements if we train first with the out-of-domain data and then fine-tune the resulting model with the original training data. Using 2000 hours of speed perturbed YouTube audio in each target language, with semi-supervised transcripts, we show improvements on multiple languages/data sets, of up to 16.3% relative improvement in WER over the baseline systems and up to 7.4% relative improvement in WER over a system that simply pools the out-of-domain data with the training data.",

In this paper, we aim to generate a metaphoric sentence given a literal expression by replacing relevant verbs. Guided by conceptual metaphor theory, we propose to control the generation process by encoding conceptual mappings between cognitive domains to generate meaningful metaphoric expressions. To achieve this, we develop two methods: 1) using FrameNet-based embeddings to learn mappings between domains and applying them at the lexical level (CM-Lex), and 2) deriving source/target pairs to train a controlled seq-to-seq generation model (CM-BART). We assess our methods through automatic and human evaluation for basic metaphoricity and conceptual metaphor presence. We show that the unsupervised CM-Lex model is competitive with recent deep learning metaphor generation systems, and CM-BART outperforms all other models both in automatic and human evaluations.",

However, most previous efforts have focused almost exclusively on English, despite the recent trend towards linguistic universal within the general community. In order to fill the gap, this paper investigates whether the established results in computational psycholinguistics can be generalized across languages. Specifically, we re-examine an established generalization -- the lower perplexity a language model has, the more human-like the language model is -- in Japanese with typologically different structures from English. Our experiments demonstrate that this established generalization exhibits a surprising lack of universality; namely, lower perplexity is not always human-like. Moreover, this discrepancy between English and Japanese is further explored from the perspective of (non-)uniform information density. Overall, our results suggest that a cross-lingual evaluation will be necessary to construct human-like computational models.",

We construct representations of the shifted quiver Yangian from general subcrystals of the canonical crystal. We derive our results via equivariant localization for supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanics for various framed quivers, where the framings are determined by the shape of the subcrystals. Our results unify many known BPS state counting problems, including open BPS counting, non-compact D4-branes, and wall crossing phenomena, simply as different representations of the shifted quiver Yangians. Furthermore, most of our representations seem to be new, and this suggests the existence of a zoo of BPS state counting problems yet to be studied in detail.",

Like many such systems the variable X-ray emission is driven by the underlying behaviour of the mass donor Be star. Previous work has shown that the optical and X-ray were characterised by regular outbursts at the proposed binary period of 119 d. However around February 2008 the optical behaviour changed substantially, with the previously regular optical outbursts ending. Reported here are new optical (OGLE) and X-ray (Swift) observations covering the period after 2008 which suggest an almost total circumstellar disc loss followed by a gradual recovery. This indicates the probable transition of a Be star to a B star, and back again. However, at the time of the most recent OGLE data (March 2020) the characteristic periodic outbursts had yet to return to their early state, indicating that the disk still had some re-building yet to complete.",

The proposed system takes into account the input from multiple indexing databases and generates a single output. Here, we have used the data from Scopus and WoS to generate a conflate dataset. Further, a comparative analysis of conflate has been performed with Scopus and WoS at three levels: author, organization, and journal. Finally, a mapping is proposed between research publications and distributed ledger technology in order to provide a transparent and distributed view to its stakeholders.",

        "abstract": "Protostellar jets have a fundamental role at the earliest evolution of protostars of all masses. In the case of low-mass (<8 Msun) protostars, strong observational evidence exists that the launching and collimation is due to the X- and/or disk-wind mechanisms. In these models, it is the protostar/disk system that creates all the necessary conditions to launch and collimate the jets near the protostar via strong magnetic fields. The origin of jets from more massive protostars has been investigated much less, in part because of the difficulty of resolving the collimation zone in these more distant objects. Here we present the highest angular resolution observations of a jet powered by a massive protostar, the Cep A HW2 radio jet. We imaged the radio emission at projected distances of only ~20 au from the protostar, resolving the innermost 100 au of a massive protostellar jet for the first time. The morphology of the radio jet emission in this massive object is very different than what is usually observed in jets from low-mass protostars. We found that the outflowing material in HW2 has two components: a wide-angle wind launched from the protostar/disk system, and a highly collimated jet starting at 20-30 au from the protostar. We discuss two possible scenarios: an extension of the classical disk-wind to a massive protostar, or external collimation of a wide-angle wind. These results have important consequences for our understanding of how stars of different masses are formed.",

These heterostructures are important for applications in spintronics; however, challenges in synthesizing graphene directly on technologically important substrates such as GaAs necessitate layer transfer steps, which can introduce defects into the graphene. \\textit{In-situ} photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal that Mn diffusion through graphene grown directly on a Ge (001) substrate is 1000 times lower than Mn diffusion into samples without graphene ($D_{gr,direct} \\sim 4\\times10^{-18}$cm$^2$/s, $D_{no-gr} \\sim 5 \\times 10^{-15}$ cm$^2$/s at 500$^\\circ$C). Transferred graphene on Ge suppresses the Mn in Ge diffusion by a factor of 10 compared to no graphene ($D_{gr,transfer} \\sim 4\\times10^{-16}cm^2/s$). For both transferred and directly-grown graphene, the low activation energy ($E_a \\sim 0.1-0.5$ eV) suggests that Mn diffusion through graphene occurs primarily at graphene defects. The diffusivity prefactor $D_0$ scales with the defect density. Similar diffusion barrier performance is found on GaAs substrates; however, it is not currently possible to grow graphene directly on GaAs. Our results highlight the importance of developing graphene growth directly on functional substrates, to avoid the damage induced by layer transfer.",

While this setting ensures some level of privacy, it has been shown that, even when data is not directly shared, the training process is vulnerable to privacy attacks including data reconstruction and model inversion attacks. Additionally, malicious agents that train on inverted labels or random data, may arbitrarily weaken the accuracy of the global model. This paper addresses these challenges and presents Privacy-preserving and trustable Distributed Learning (PT-DL), a fully decentralized framework that relies on Differential Privacy to guarantee strong privacy protections of the agents' data, and Ethereum smart contracts to ensure trustability. The paper shows that PT-DL is resilient up to a 50% collusion attack, with high probability, in a malicious trust model and the experimental evaluation illustrates the benefits of the proposed model as a privacy-preserving and trustable distributed multi-agent learning system on several classification tasks.",

Such landscapes consist of a parabolic confining potential and a random part in $N\\gg 1$ dimensions. When the relative strength $m$ of the parabolic part is decreasing below a critical value $m_c$, the random energy landscapes exhibit a glass-like transition from a simple phase with very few critical points to a complex phase with the energy surface having exponentially many critical points. We obtain the annealed probability distribution of the instability index $k$ by working out the mean size of the population of saddles with index $k$ relative to the mean size of the entire population of critical points and observe toppling of stability hierarchy which accompanies the underlying glass-like transition. In the transition region $m=m_c + \\delta N^{-1/2}$ the typical instability index scales as $k = \\kappa N^{1/4}$ and the toppling mechanism affects whole instability index distribution, in particular the most probable value of $\\kappa$ changes from $\\kappa = 0$ in the simple phase ($\\delta > 0 $) to a non-zero value $ \\kappa_{\\max} \\propto (-\\delta)^{3/2}$ in the complex phase ($\\delta < 0$).

We confirm and characterize TOI-674b, a low-density super-Neptune transiting a nearby M dwarf. The host star (TIC 158588995, $V = 14.2$ mag, $J = 10.3$ mag) is characterized by its M2V spectral type with $\\mathrm{M}_\\star=0.420\\pm 0.010$ M$_\\odot$, $\\mathrm{R}_\\star = 0.420\\pm 0.013$ R$_\\odot$, and $\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 3514\\pm 57$ K, and is located at a distance $d=46.16 \\pm 0.03$ pc. Combining the available transit light curves plus radial velocity measurements and jointly fitting a circular orbit model, we find an orbital period of $1.977143 \\pm 3\\times 10^{-6}$ days, a planetary radius of $5.25 \\pm 0.17$ $\\mathrm{R}_\\oplus$, and a mass of $23.6 \\pm 3.3$ $\\mathrm{M}_\\oplus$ implying a mean density of $\\rho_\\mathrm{p} = 0.91 \\pm 0.15$ [g cm$^{-3}$]. A non-circular orbit model fit delivers similar planetary mass and radius values within the uncertainties. Given the measured planetary radius and mass, TOI-674b is one of the largest and most massive super-Neptune class planets discovered around an M type star to date. It is also a resident of the so-called Neptunian desert and a promising candidate for atmospheric characterisation using the James Webb Space Telescope.",

The analysis is based on the mean flow velocity profiles obtained from experimental measurements carried out for two values of Reynolds number, 1850 and 3350, which are based on the plate thickness and the free-stream velocity. Two different trailing edge geometries of the flat plate are considered in this study: blunt and circular. By performing local spatio-temporal analyses on the measured mean flow velocity profiles, we estimate the global shedding frequency of the flow. This is in excellent agreement with the shedding frequency measured experimentally. To complement the study, we carry out a low-dimensional modeling based on the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the flow fields which is novel for flat plate wakes. We observe that a model based on only two POD modes produces an accurate estimate of the global shedding frequency. Our results also highlight the role of the nonlinear interaction strength between the mean flow with the higher harmonics thereby experimentally supporting the theoretical criterion outlined in Sipp & Lebedev (JFM 2007).",

A key issue in this field is to unveil the unique reconstructed electronic structure, which successfully accommodates different orders and interactions to form a fertile ground for emergent phenomena. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) evidence for two distinct band reconstructions in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. The first one is characterized by the appearance of new electron energy band at low temperature. The new band is theoretically reproduced when the three dimensionality of the charge order is considered for a band-folding along the out-of-plane direction. The second reconstruction is identified as a surface induced orbital-selective shift of the electron energy band. Our results provide the first evidence for the three dimensionality of the charge order in single-particle spectral function, highlighting the importance of long-range out-of-plane electronic correlations in this layered kagome superconductor. They also point to the feasibility of orbital-selective control of the band structure via surface modification, which would open a new avenue for manipulating exotic phenomena in this system, including superconductivity.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear short-range correlations (SRC) induce high-momentum/high-energy fluctuations in the nuclear medium. In order to assess the impact of SRC on nuclear bulk properties, like nucleon radii and kinetic energies, it is instrumental to determine how SRC are distributed in phase space as this sheds light on the connection between the appearance of SRC in coordinate and momentum space. Using the lowest-order correlation operator approximation (LCA) to include SRC, we compute two-dimensional nuclear Wigner quasiprobability distributions $w(r, k)$ to locate those $({r}, {k})$ phase-space regions that are most heavily impacted by SRC. The SRC-induced high-momentum components find their origin in a radial range that is confined to the nuclear interior. Significant SRC strength is generated in the full momentum range $0 \\leq k \\lesssim 5 ~\\text{fm}^{-1} $ covered in this work, but below the Fermi momentum those are dwarfed by the mean-field contributions. As an application of $w(r, k)$, we focus on the radial dependence of the kinetic energy $T$ and the momentum dependence of the nucleon radius $r_{\\text{rms}}$ for the symmetric nuclei $^{12}$C, $^{40}$Ca and the asymmetric nucleus $^{48}$Ca. The kinetic energy almost doubles after including SRCs, with the largest increase occurring in the nuclear interior $r \\lesssim 2$ fm. The momentum dependence of the $r_{\\text{rms}}$ teaches that the largest contributions stem from $k \\lesssim 2 $ fm$^{-1}$, where the SRC induce a slight reduction of the order of a few percent. The SRC systematically reduce the $^{48}$Ca neutron skin by an amount that can be 10%.",

Many of these regions are gradually gaining access to internet infrastructure, although not with a strong enough connection to allow for sustained communication with a medical practitioner. Several deaths resulting from this lack of medical access, absence of patient's previous health records, and the unavailability of information in indigenous languages can be easily prevented. In this paper, we describe an approach leveraging the phenomenal progress in Machine Learning and NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques to design a model that is low-resource, multilingual, and a preliminary first-point-of-contact medical assistant. Our contribution includes defining the NLP pipeline required for named-entity-recognition, language-agnostic sentence embedding, natural language translation, information retrieval, question answering, and generative pre-training for final query processing. We obtain promising results for this pipeline and preliminary results for EHR (Electronic Health Record) analysis with text summarization for medical practitioners to peruse for their diagnosis. Through this NLP pipeline, we aim to provide preliminary medical information to the user and do not claim to supplant diagnosis from qualified medical practitioners. Using the input from subject matter experts, we have compiled a large corpus to pre-train and fine-tune our BioBERT based NLP model for the specific tasks. We expect recent advances in NLP architectures, several of which are efficient and privacy-preserving models, to further the impact of our solution and improve on individual task performance.",

The requirements placed by flavour physics and these other applications are surveyed, with an emphasis on the momentum range over which PID is necessary.

Examples include: which of two alternative paper titles is better? is this comment toxic? what is the political leaning of this news article? We refer to such tasks as survey settings because the ground truth is defined through a survey of one or more human raters. In survey settings, conventional measurements of classifier accuracy such as precision, recall, and cross-entropy confound the quality of the classifier with the level of agreement among human raters. Thus, they have no meaningful interpretation on their own. We describe a procedure that, given a dataset with predictions from a classifier and K ratings per item, rescales any accuracy measure into one that has an intuitive interpretation. The key insight is to score the classifier not against the best proxy for the ground truth, such as a majority vote of the raters, but against a single human rater at a time. That score can be compared to other predictors' scores, in particular predictors created by combining labels from several other human raters. The survey equivalence of any classifier is the minimum number of raters needed to produce the same expected score as that found for the classifier.",

To avoid loss in communication, mobile devices need to locate narrow directional beams with millisecond latency. In this work, we demonstrate a true-time-delay (TTD) array with digitally reconfigurable delay elements enabling both fast beam-training at the receiver with wideband data communications. In beam-training mode, large delay-bandwidth products are implemented to accelerate beam training using frequency-dependent probing beams. In data communications mode, precise beam alignment is achieved to mitigate spatial effects during beam-forming for wideband signals. The 4-element switched-capacitor based time-interleaved array uses a compact closed-loop integrator for signal combining with the delay compensation implemented in the clock domain to achieve high precision and large delay range. Prototyped in TSMC 65nm CMOS, the TTD SSP successfully demonstrates unique frequency-to-angle mapping with 3.8ns maximum delay and 800MHz bandwidth in the beam-training mode. In the data communications mode, nearly 12dB uniform beamforming gain is achieved from 80MHz to 800MHz. The TTD SSP consumes 29mW at 1V supply achieving 122MB/s with 16-QAM at 9.8% EVM.",

If $X$ satisfies some further conditions then such an almost parametrization can be upgraded to a geometrically quasiconformal homeomorphism or a quasisymmetric homeomorphism. In particular, we recover Rajala's recent quasiconformal uniformization theorem in the special case that $X$ is locally geodesic as well as Bonk-Kleiner's quasisymmetric uniformization theorem.

We partition the input space into small cells and then \"assemble\" their robustness (to the ground truth) according to the OP, where estimators on the cells' robustness and OPs are provided. Reliability estimates in terms of the probability of misclassification per input (pmi) can be derived together with confidence levels. A prototype tool is demonstrated with simplified case studies. Model assumptions and extension to real-world applications are also discussed. While our model easily uncovers the inherent difficulties of assessing the DL dependability (e.g. lack of data with ground truth and scalability issues), we provide preliminary/compromised solutions to advance in this research direction.",

A wide range of measurements will be possible in heavy-flavour spectroscopy, rare decays of heavy-flavoured particles and $C\\!P$-violation studies, which will benefit from the clean experimental environment, the high Lorentz boost, and the availability of the full spectrum of hadron species. This essay first surveys the important questions in heavy-flavour physics, and assesses the likely theoretical and experimental landscape at the turn-on of FCC-ee. From this certain measurements are identified where the impact of FCC-ee will be particularly important. A full exploitation of the heavy-flavour potential of FCC-ee places specific constraints and challenges on detector design, which in some cases are in tension with those imposed by the other physics goals of the facility.

Through new insights into the manifold geometry underlying a generic latent position model, we show that this can be accomplished in two steps: matrix factorisation, followed by nonlinear dimension reduction. This combination is effective because the point cloud obtained in the first step lives close to a manifold in which latent distance is encoded as geodesic distance. Hence, a nonlinear dimension reduction tool, approximating geodesic distance, can recover the latent positions, up to a simple transformation. We give a detailed account of the case where spectral embedding is used, followed by Isomap, and provide encouraging experimental evidence for other combinations of techniques.",

The proposed method exploits a deep neural network to map observed signal features to corresponding step-sizes which control the filter adaptation. The parameters of the network are optimized in an end-to-end fashion by minimizing the average system distance of the adaptive filter. This avoids the need of explicit signal power spectral density estimation as required for model-based adaptation control and further auxiliary mechanisms to deal with model inaccuracies. The proposed algorithm achieves fast convergence and robust steady-state performance for scenarios characterized by non-white and non-stationary noise signals, time-varying environment changes and additional model inaccuracies.",

(ii) Existing models tend to select undesirable candidates that have large overlaps with the dialogue history. (iii) Negative instances in training are mainly constructed by random sampling from the corpus, whereas generated candidates in practice typically have a closer distribution. To address the above problems, we create a new dataset called ConvAI2+ and propose a new response selector called Global-Selector. Experimental results show that Global-Selector trained on ConvAI2+ have noticeable improvements in both accuracy and inference speed.",

Various methods have been proposed to mitigate the impact of noise on variational algorithms, including several that model the noise as damping expectation values of observables. In this work, we benchmark various methods, including two new methods proposed here, for estimating the damping factor and hence recovering the noise-free expectation values. We compare their performance in estimating the ground-state energies of several instances of the 1D mixed-field Ising model using the variational-quantum-eigensolver algorithm with up to 20 qubits on two of IBM's quantum computers. We find that several error-mitigation techniques allow us to recover energies to within 10% of the true values for circuits containing up to about 25 ansatz layers, where each layer consists of CNOT gates between all neighboring qubits and Y-rotations on all qubits.",

We expect the computer to 'imagine' the scene from the captured sound, generating original images that picture the sound emitting source. Previous studies on similar topics opted for simplified approaches using data with low content diversity and/or strong supervision. Differently, we propose to perform unsupervised S2I translation using thousands of distinct and unknown scenes, with slightly pre-cleaned data, just enough to guarantee aural-visual semantic coherence. To that end, we employ conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) with a deep densely connected generator. Besides, we implemented a moving-average adversarial loss to address GANs training instability. Though the specified S2I translation problem is quite challenging, we were able to generalize the translator model enough to obtain more than 14%, in average, of interpretable and semantically coherent images translated from unknown sounds. Additionally, we present a solution using informativity classifiers to perform quantitative evaluation of S2I translation.",

The models are trained using quantile regression, a non-parametric approach that assumes no prior knowledge of the probabilistic forecasting distribution. The case study is composed of PV production monitored on-site at the University of Li\u00e8ge (ULi\u00e8ge), Belgium. The weather forecasts from the regional climate model provided by the Laboratory of Climatology are used as inputs of the deep learning models. The forecast quality is quantitatively assessed by the continuous ranked probability and interval scores. The results indicate this architecture improves the forecast quality and is computationally efficient to be incorporated in an intraday decision-making tool for robust optimization.",

Widely applied to more fields to predict unstable grasping with time series data, algorithms can significantly promote the application of artificial intelligence in traditional industries. This research investigates models that combine short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and long short-term memory (LSTM) and then tested generalizability with dexterous hand and suction cup gripper. The experiments suggest good results for grasp stability prediction with the force data and the generalized results in the pressure data. Among the 4 models, (Data + STFT) & LSTM delivers the best performance. We plan to perform more work on grasp stability prediction, generalize the findings to different types of sensors, and apply the grasp stability prediction in more grasping use cases in real life.",

Recently, Data resemblance detection is a novel technology to detect redundancy among similarity. It extracts feature from each chunk content and treat chunks with high similarity as candidates for removing redundancy. However, popular resemblance methods such as \"N-transform\" and \"Finesse\" use only the chunk data for feature extraction. A minor modification on the data chunk could seriously deteriorate its capability for resemblance detection. In this paper, we proposes a novel chunk-context aware resemblance detection algorithm, called CARD, to mitigate this issue. CARD introduces a BP-Neural network-based chunk-context aware model, and uses N-sub-chunk shingles-based initial feature extraction strategy. It effectively integrates each data chunk content's internal structure with the context information for feature extraction, the impact of small changes in data chunks is significantly reduced. To evaluate its performance, we implement a CARD prototype and conduct extensive experiments using real-world data sets. The results show that CARD can detect up to 75.03% more redundant data and accelerate the resemblance detection operations by 5.6 to 17.8 times faster compared with the state-of-the-art resemblance detection approaches.",

In Lattice QCD, where the matrix has a 4D toroidal lattice structure, these non-local operators correspond to a $PA^{-1}$ where $P$ is the permutation relating to some displacement in one or more dimensions. We focus on a single dimension displacement ($k$) but our methods are general. We show that probing on $A^p$ or $(PA)^p$ do not annihilate the largest magnitude elements. To resolve this issue, our displacement-based probing works on $PA^p$ using a new coloring scheme that works directly on appropriately displaced neighborhoods on the lattice. We prove lower bounds on the number of colors needed, and study the effect of this scheme on variance reduction, both theoretically and experimentally on a real-world Lattice QCD calculation. We achieve orders of magnitude speedup over the un-probed or the naively probed methods.",

In particular, industrial inspection applications can take advantage of such features, as demonstrated by the multiple successes of related methods on the MVTec Anomaly Detection (MVTec AD) dataset. These methods make use of neural networks pre-trained on auxiliary classification tasks such as ImageNet. However, to our knowledge, no comparative study of robustness to the low data regimes between these approaches has been conducted yet. For quality inspection applications, the handling of limited sample sizes may be crucial as large quantities of images are not available for small series. In this work, we aim to compare three approaches based on deep pre-trained features when varying the quantity of available data in MVTec AD: KNN, Mahalanobis, and PaDiM. We show that although these methods are mostly robust to small sample sizes, they still can benefit greatly from using data augmentation in the original image space, which allows to deal with very small production runs.",

In the latter case, a high-inelasticity peculiar region in the $(\\alpha,\\beta)$ parameter space is found, inside which the critical wave number associated with the longitudinal modes diverges. Comparison with event-driven molecular dynamics simulations for hard disks shows that this region of absolute instability may be an artifact of the extrapolation to high inelasticity of the approximations made in the derivation of the transport coefficients, although it signals a strong unstable characterization of this parameter zone. In the case of moderate inelasticity ($\\alpha=0.7$), on the other hand, a good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the simulation results is found.",

Then we propose a new primal-dual algorithm framework FedHybrid that allows different clients to perform various types of updates. Specifically, each client can choose to perform either gradient-type or Newton-type updates. We propose a novel analysis framework for primal-dual methods and obtain a linear convergence rate of FedHybrid for strongly convex functions and a sublinear convergence rate for general convex functions, regardless of clients' choices of gradient-type or Newton-type updates.

The coaction on the functions is constructed by pairing a basis of differential forms, corresponding to master integrals, with a basis of integration contours, corresponding to independent cut integrals. At one loop, a general diagrammatic coaction was established using dimensional regularisation, which may be realised in terms of a global coaction on hypergeometric functions, or equivalently, order by order in the $\\epsilon$ expansion, via a local coaction on multiple polylogarithms. The present paper takes the first steps in generalising the diagrammatic coaction beyond one loop. We first establish general properties that govern the diagrammatic coaction at any loop order. We then focus on examples of two-loop topologies for which all integrals expand into polylogarithms. In each case we determine bases of master integrals and cuts in terms of hypergeometric functions, and then use the global coaction to establish the diagrammatic coaction of all master integrals in the topology. The diagrammatic coaction encodes the complete set of discontinuities of Feynman integrals, as well as the differential equations they satisfy, providing a general tool to understand their physical and mathematical properties.",

In the convex setting, we retrieve and sharpen known results from the literature. However, our results also apply beyond the convex setting. We illustrate this by providing a complete account of the \"collapse to the mean\" for quasiconvex functionals. In the special cases of consistent risk measures and Choquet integrals, we can even dispense with quasiconvexity. In addition, we relate the \"collapse to the mean\" to the study of solutions of a broad class of optimisation problems with law-invariant objectives that appear in mathematical finance, insurance, and economics. We show that the corresponding quantile formulations studied in the literature are sometimes illegitimate and require further analysis.",

These properties are defined formally within a generic dynamic latent position model. By showing how this model can be recast as a multilayer random dot product graph, we demonstrate that unfolded adjacency spectral embedding satisfies both stability conditions, allowing, for example, spatio-temporal clustering under the dynamic stochastic block model. We also show how alternative methods, such as omnibus, independent or time-averaged spectral embedding, lack one or the other form of stability.",

However, the duration and the consequences of such encounters perhaps are small such that there is no direct evidence of their occurrence. As a first approximation, in this work, we analytically analyze the interaction of a massive object that moves at high velocity into a cluster of negligible mass particles with an initial number density distribution $\\propto R^{-\\alpha}$. We have found that the runaway conditions of the distribution after the encounter are related to the mass and the velocity of the star and the impact parameter of each particle to the stellar object. Then, the cluster particles are gravitationally accelerated by the external approaching star, destroying the cluster and the dispersion and velocities of the particles have explosive characteristics. We compare this analytical model with several numerical simulations and finally, we applied our results to the Orion Fingers in the Orion BN/KL region, which show an explosive outflow that could be triggered by the gravitational interaction of several (proto)stellar objects.",

While X-ray fluxes and surface magnetic fields can be derived from observations, the EUV emission and wind mass fluxes, Coronal Mass Ejections and associated Stellar Energetic Particle events cannot be directly observed. Here, we present the results of a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model with inputs constrained by spectropolarimetric data, HST/STIS Far UV, X-ray data data and stellar magnetic maps reconstructed at two epochs separated by 11 months. The simulations show that over the course of the year, the global stellar corona had undergone a drastic transition from a simple dipole-like to a tilted dipole with multipole field components, and thus, provided favorable conditions for Corotating Interaction Events (CIRs) that drive strong shocks. The dynamic pressure exerted by CIRs are 1300 times larger than those observed from the Sun and can contribute to the atmospheric erosion of early Venus, Earth, Mars and young Earth-like exoplanets. Our data-constrained MHD model provides the framework to model coronal environments of G-M planet hosting dwarfs. The model outputs can serve as a realistic input for exoplanetary atmospheric models to evaluate the impact of stellar coronal emission, stellar winds and CIRs on their atmospheric escape and chemistry that can be tested in the upcoming JWST and ground-based observations.",

Several Nash solvers exist, yet none scale to normal-form games with many actions and many players, especially those with payoff tensors too big to be stored in memory. In this work, we propose an approach that iteratively improves an approximation to a Nash equilibrium through joint play. It accomplishes this by tracing a previously established homotopy which connects instances of the game defined with decaying levels of entropy regularization. To encourage iterates to remain near this path, we efficiently minimize \\emph{average deviation incentive} via stochastic gradient descent, intelligently sampling entries in the payoff tensor as needed. This process can also be viewed as constructing and reacting to a polymatrix approximation to the game. In these ways, our proposed approach, \\emph{average deviation incentive descent with adaptive sampling} (ADIDAS), is most similar to three classical approaches, namely homotopy-type, Lyapunov, and iterative polymatrix solvers. We demonstrate through experiments the ability of this approach to approximate a Nash equilibrium in normal-form games with as many as seven players and twenty one actions (over one trillion outcomes) that are orders of magnitude larger than those possible with prior algorithms.",

The total number of cooperation rounds at transmitter and receiver sides is limited to $\\D$ rounds. We derive inner and outer bounds on the MG region. In the limit as $\\D\\to \\infty$, the bounds coincide and the results show that transmitting delay-sensitive messages does not cause any penalty on the sum MG. For finite $\\D$ our bounds are still close and prove that the penalty caused by delay-sensitive transmissions is small.",

One of these avenues is the exploration of new alternative brain-inspired computing architectures that promise to achieve the flexibility and computational efficiency of biological neural processing systems. Within this context, neuromorphic intelligence represents a paradigm shift in computing based on the implementation of spiking neural network architectures tightly co-locating processing and memory. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the field, highlighting the different levels of granularity present in existing silicon implementations, comparing approaches that aim at replicating natural intelligence (bottom-up) versus those that aim at solving practical artificial intelligence applications (top-down), and assessing the benefits of the different circuit design styles used to achieve these goals. First, we present the analog, mixed-signal and digital circuit design styles, identifying the boundary between processing and memory through time multiplexing, in-memory computation and novel devices. Next, we highlight the key tradeoffs for each of the bottom-up and top-down approaches, survey their silicon implementations, and carry out detailed comparative analyses to extract design guidelines. Finally, we identify both necessary synergies and missing elements required to achieve a competitive advantage for neuromorphic edge computing over conventional machine-learning accelerators, and outline the key elements for a framework toward neuromorphic intelligence.",

The behavior is absent in the density matched system indicating that presence of a nearby wall generating a flow-gradient at the droplet level is at the root of this behvaior. Our experiments with optical cells of different vertical heights further highlight that the behavior is observed for a given range of shear rate only and does not depend on the bulk flow-rate. We hypothesize, that the imposed shear flow disturbs the otherwise isotropic distribution of the solutes (filled/empty micelles) allowing the droplets to go against the flow. We also observe that the nematic nature of the droplets also affects the motion during the rheotactic flight. By taking the advantage of this phenomenon, we demonstrate a unique capability of the droplet to be hydrodynamically trapped locally in an external shear flow, which can be useful towards new applications.",

        "abstract": "According to recent arguments by the author, the conformal field theory (CFT) describing the scaling limit of the integer quantum Hall plateau transition is a deformed level-4 Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model with Riemannian target space inside a complex Lie supergroup GL. After a summary of that proposal and some of its predictions, the leading irrelevant and relevant perturbations of the proposed CFT are discussed. Argued to be marginal, these result in a non-standard renormalization group (RG) flow near criticality, which calls for modified finite-size scaling analysis and may explain the long-standing inability of numerical work to reach agreement on the values of critical exponents. The technique of operator product expansion is used to compute the RG-beta functions up to cubic order in the couplings. The mean value of the dissipative conductance at the RG-fixed point is calculated for a cylinder geometry with any aspect ratio.",

Using inhomogeneous solutions of the star-triangle relation with a one or two dimensional spectral parameter, changing their functional form depending on the orientation, we provide an explicit construction of the transfer matrix and establish its conservation law and involutivity properties. Integrability is independently demonstrated by numerically exploring the spectral statistics via the Berry-Tabor conjecture. Curiously, we find that the deformed rule 54 model generically possesses no other local conserved quantities besides the net soliton current.",

First, we show that the turbulent motion at large scales obeys Gaussian statistics in the interval 0 < Rlambda < 8.8, where Rlambda is the microscale Reynolds number, and that the Gaussian flow breaks down to yield place to anomalous scaling at the universal Reynolds number bounding the inequality above. In the inertial range of turbulence that emerges following the breakdown, the effective Reynolds number based on the turbulent viscosity, Rlambda* assumes this same constant value of about 9. This scenario works also for the emergence of turbulence from an initially non-turbulent state. Second, we derive expressions for the anomalous scaling exponents of structure functions and moments of spatial derivatives, by analyzing the Navier-Stokes equations in the form developed by Hopf. We present a novel procedure to close the Hopf equation, resulting in expressions for zetan in the entire range of allowable moment-order, n, and demonstrate that accounting for the temporal dynamics changes the scaling from normal to anomalous. For large n, the theory predicts the saturation of zetan with n, leading to two inferences: (a) the smallest length scale etan = LRe-1 << LRe-3/4, where Re is the large-scale Reynolds number, and (b) velocity excursions across even the smallest length scales can sometimes be as large as the large scale velocity itself. Theoretical predictions for each of these aspects are shown to be in quantitative agreement with available experimental and numerical data.",

In a series of two papers Blasco et al. have raised the problem of characterizing all semigroups of holomorphic functions $(\\varphi_t)$ that can replace the semigroup of rotations in Sarason's Theorem. We give a complete answer to this question, in terms of a logarithmic vanishing oscillation condition on the infinitesimal generator of the semigroup $(\\varphi_t)$. In addition we confirm the conjecture of Blasco et al. that all such semigroups are elliptic. We also investigate the analogous question for the Bloch and the little Bloch space and surprisingly enough we find that the semigroups for which the Bloch version of Sarason's Theorem holds are exactly the same as in the $BMOA$ case.",

We analyze conditions necessary for the onset of the DS instability and the properties of the final stationary state of the graphene electron system.

These methods usually recommend news based on the matching between news content and user interest inferred from historical behaviors. However, these methods usually have difficulties in making accurate recommendations to cold-start users, and tend to recommend similar news with those users have read. In general, popular news usually contain important information and can attract users with different interests. Besides, they are usually diverse in content and topic. Thus, in this paper we propose to incorporate news popularity information to alleviate the cold-start and diversity problems for personalized news recommendation. In our method, the ranking score for recommending a candidate news to a target user is the combination of a personalized matching score and a news popularity score. The former is used to capture the personalized user interest in news. The latter is used to measure time-aware popularity of candidate news, which is predicted based on news content, recency, and real-time CTR using a unified framework. Besides, we propose a popularity-aware user encoder to eliminate the popularity bias in user behaviors for accurate interest modeling. Experiments on two real-world datasets show our method can effectively improve the accuracy and diversity for news recommendation.",

Interaction of matters is phenomenologically described by gauge theory of strong, electromagnetic, weak and gravitational interactions.

Charge of leptons and quarks define hypercharge $Y$, and via Higgs mechanism $SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y$ symmetry forms $U(1)_{em}$ symmetry. In order to describe Hadron dynamics properly, embedding of 4-dimensional space to 5-dimensional space was tried in lattice simulations, and in light front holographic QCD (LFHQCD) approach in which conformally symmetric light-front dynamics without ghost are embedded in $AdS_5$, and a parameter that fixes a mass scale was chosen from the Principle of Maximum Conformality. Coulomb or Landau gauge fixed Faddeev-Popov Yang-Mills field equation is known to have the Gribov ambiguity, and tunneling between vacua between different topological structures was proposed by van Baal and collaborators. The symmetry of three colors can be assigned three vectors of quaternion ${\\bf H}$, whose multiplication on $2\\times 2$ matrices of Dirac spinors on ${\\bf S}^3$ induces transformations. Instantons or sphalerons whose presence is expected from conformal equivalence of ${\\bf S}^3\\times {\\bf R}$ to ${\\bf R}^4$ are reviewed.

Assuming that the particle energy is the dominant scale in the problem, an approximate solution of classical equations of motion is derived and the characteristic features of the motion are examined. A specific regime is found with comparable strong field quantum parameters of the beams, when the electron trajectory exhibits ultrashort spike-like features, which bears great significance to the corresponding radiation properties. An analytical expression for the spectral distribution of spontaneous radiation is derived in the framework of the Baier-Katkov semiclassical approximation based on the classical trajectory. All the analytical results are further validated by exact numerical calculations. We consider a non-resonant regime of interaction, when the laser frequencies in the electron rest frame are far from each other, avoiding stimulated emission. Special attention is devoted to settings when the description of radiation via the local constant field approximation fails and to corresponding spectral features. Periodic and non-periodic regimes are considered, when lab frequencies of the laser waves are always commensurate. The sensitivity of spectra with respect to the electron beam spread, focusing and finite duration of the laser beams is explored.",

Reducing the tritium fraction, $f_t$, in a $DT$ burning plasma below a half increases the burn fraction, $f_{tb}\\propto1/f_t$ but also the required confinement to achieve a burn $nT\\tau_E\\propto1/f_t(1-f_t)$. A doubling of the fractional burn entails only a 4/3 enhancement of the required $nT\\tau_E$. The energy confinement time $\\tau_E$ in tokamaks and stellarators is empirically gyro-Bohm with an approximate factor of two between the best and worse results used to construct scaling laws. Gyro-Bohm is also the approximate level of transport needed in a power plant. What has received little study are $\\tau_t/\\tau_E$, the ratio of the tritium to the energy confinement time, and $\\tau_\\alpha/\\tau_E$, the ratio of the alpha particle to the energy confinement time. The tritium burn fraction is proportional to $\\tau_t/\\tau_E$, so the larger the better. The contamination of the plasma by helium ash is proportional to $\\tau_\\alpha/\\tau_E$, so the smaller the better.",

        "abstract": "The underlying physical concept of computing out-of-time-ordered correlation (OTOC) is a significant new tool within the framework of quantum field theory, which now-a-days is treated as a measure of random fluctuations. In this paper, by following the canonical quantization technique, we demonstrate a computational method to quantify the two different types of cosmological auto-correlated OTO functions during the epoch when the non-equilibrium features dominates in primordial cosmology. In this formulation, two distinct dynamical time scales are involved to define the quantum mechanical operators arising from the cosmological perturbation scenario. We have provided detailed explanation regarding the necessity of this new formalism to quantify any random events generated from quantum fluctuations in primordial cosmology. We have performed an elaborative computation for the two types of two-point and four-point auto-correlated OTO functions in terms of the cosmological perturbation field variables and its canonically conjugate momenta to quantify random auto-correlations in the non-equilibrium regime. For both of the cases, we found significantly distinguishable non-chaotic, but random, behaviour in the OTO auto-correlations, which was not pointed out before in this type of study. Finally, we have also demonstrated the classical limiting behaviour of the mentioned two types of auto-correlated OTOC functions from the thermally weighted phase-space averaged Poisson brackets, which we found to exactly match the large time limiting behaviour of the auto-correlations in the super-horizon regime of the cosmological scalar mode fluctuation.",

Bistabilty is a result taking into account an additional ion channel, which has a non-monotonic characteristic and can be interpreted as a channel with a communication defect.

A significant $\\rho(T)_{H,\\theta}$ rounding is observed just above the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ due to Cooper pairs created by superconducting fluctuations. These data are analyzed in terms of a generalization of the Aslamazov-Larkin approach, that extends its applicability to high reduced-temperatures and magnetic fields. This method allows us to carry out a criterion-independent determination of the angular dependence of the upper critical field, $H_{c2}(\\theta)$. In spite of the relatively small anisotropy of this compound, it is found that $H_{c2}(\\theta)$ presents a significant deviation from the single-band 3D anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (3D-aGL) approach, particularly for large $\\theta$ (typically above $\\sim60^o$). These results are interpreted in terms of the multiband nature of these materials, in contrast with other proposals for similar $H_{c2}(\\theta)$ anomalies. Our results are also consistent with an effective anisotropy factor almost temperature independent near $T_c$, a result that differs from the ones obtained by using a single-band model.",

In this work, we evaluate the performance of BO algorithms with a collection of surrogate model and acquisition function pairs across five diverse experimental materials systems, namely carbon nanotube polymer blends, silver nanoparticles, lead-halide perovskites, as well as additively manufactured polymer structures and shapes. By defining acceleration and enhancement metrics for general materials optimization objectives, we find that for surrogate model selection, Gaussian Process (GP) with anisotropic kernels (automatic relevance detection, ARD) and Random Forests (RF) have comparable performance and both outperform the commonly used GP without ARD. We discuss the implicit distributional assumptions of RF and GP, and the benefits of using GP with anisotropic kernels in detail. We provide practical insights for experimentalists on surrogate model selection of BO during materials optimization campaigns.",

By decomposing the initial transverse field into a spatial basis whose elements have known and analytical propagation characteristics, we are able to analytically propagate any desired field, making the calculation fast and easy. By selecting a basis other than that of planes waves, we overcome the problem of numerical artefacts in the angular spectrum approach and at the same time are able to offer an intuitive understanding for why certain classes of fields propagate as they do. We outline the concept theoretically, compare it to the numerical angular spectrum approach, and confirm its veracity experimentally using a range of instructive examples. We believe that this modal approach to propagating light will be a useful addition to toolbox for propagating optical fields.",

        "abstract": "Signal predictions for galactic dark matter (DM) searches often rely on assumptions on the DM phase-space distribution function (DF) in halos. This applies to both particle (e.g. $p$-wave suppressed or Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation, scattering off atoms, etc.) and macroscopic DM candidates (e.g. microlensing of primordial black holes). As experiments and observations improve in precision, better assessing theoretical uncertainties becomes pressing in the prospect of deriving reliable constraints on DM candidates or trustworthy hints for detection. Most reliable predictions of DFs in halos are based on solving the steady-state collisionless Boltzmann equation (e.g. Eddington-like inversions, action-angle methods, etc.) consistently with observational constraints. One can do so starting from maximal symmetries and a minimal set of degrees of freedom, and then increasing complexity. Key issues are then whether adding complexity, which is computationally costy, improves predictions, and if so where to stop. Clues can be obtained by making predictions for zoomed-in hydrodynamical cosmological simulations in which one can access the true (coarse-grained) phase-space information. Here, we test an axisymmetric extension of the Eddington inversion to predict the full DM DF from its density profile and the total gravitational potential of the system. This permits to go beyond spherical symmetry, and is a priori well suited for spiral galaxies. We show that axisymmetry does not necessarily improve over spherical symmetry because the (observationally unconstrained) angular momentum of the DM halo is not generically aligned with the baryonic one. Theoretical errors are similar to those of the Eddington inversion though, at the 10-20% level for velocity-dependent predictions related to particle DM searches in spiral galaxies. We extensively describe the approach and comment on the results.",

        "abstract": "To mitigate the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, decision-makers and public authorities have announced various non-pharmaceutical policies. Analyzing the causal impact of these policies in reducing the spread of COVID-19 is important for future policy-making. The main challenge here is the existence of unobserved confounders (e.g., vigilance of residents). Besides, as the confounders may be time-varying during COVID-19 (e.g., vigilance of residents changes in the course of the pandemic), it is even more difficult to capture them. In this paper, we study the problem of assessing the causal effects of different COVID-19 related policies on the outbreak dynamics in different counties at any given time period. To this end, we integrate data about different COVID-19 related policies (treatment) and outbreak dynamics (outcome) for different United States counties over time and analyze them with respect to variables that can infer the confounders, including the covariates of different counties, their relational information and historical information. Based on these data, we develop a neural network based causal effect estimation framework which leverages above information in observational data and learns the representations of time-varying (unobserved) confounders. In this way, it enables us to quantify the causal impact of policies at different granularities, ranging from a category of policies with a certain goal to a specific policy type in this category. Besides, experimental results also indicate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in capturing the confounders for quantifying the causal impact of different policies. More specifically, compared with several baseline methods, our framework captures the outbreak dynamics more accurately, and our assessment of policies is more consistent with existing epidemiological studies of COVID-19.",

We have concentrated a wide range for n ($10\\leq n \\leq 1000$) for drawing the profiles of different physical parameters. The maximum allowable mass for different values of $n$ have been obtained by M-R plot. We have checked that the stability of the model is increased for larger value of $n$. For the viability of the model we have considered two compact stars PSR J1614-2230 and EXO 1785-248.

In both the applications and theoretical study of such microscale swimmers, control is often mediated by an engineered property of the swimmer, such as in the case of magnetically propelled microrobots. In this work, we will consider a modality of control that is applicable in more generality, effecting guidance via modulation of a background fluid flow. Here, considering a model swimmer in a commonplace flow and simple geometry, we analyse and subsequently establish the efficacy of flow-mediated microswimmer positional control, later touching upon a question of optimal control. Moving beyond idealised notions of controllability and towards considerations of practical utility, we then evaluate the robustness of this control modality to sources of variation that may be present in applications, examining in particular the effects of measurement inaccuracy and rotational noise. This exploration gives rise to a number of cautionary observations, which, overall, demonstrate the need for the careful assessment of both policy and behavioural robustness when designing control schemes for use in practice.",

Generalized Moyal-Weyl deformations are considered when, for nonassociative and noncommutative terms of star deformations, there are used nonholonomic frames (bases) instead of local partial derivatives. In such modified nonassociative and nonholonomic spacetimes and associated complex/ real phase spaces, the coefficients of geometric and physical objects depend both on base spacetime coordinates and conventional (co) fiber velocity/ momentum variables like in (non) commutative Finsler-Lagrange-Hamilton geometry. For nonassociative and (non) commutative phase spaces modelled as total spaces of (co) tangent bundles on Lorentz manifolds enabled with star products and nonholonomic frames, we consider associated nonlinear connection, N-connection, structures determining conventional horizontal and (co) vertical (for instance, 4+4) splitting of dimensions and N-adapted decompositions of fundamental geometric objects. There are defined and computed in abstract geometric and N-adapted coefficient forms the torsion, curvature and Ricci tensors. We extend certain methods of nonholonomic geometry in order to construct R-flux deformations of vacuum Einstein equations for the case of N-adapted linear connections and symmetric and nonsymmetric metric structures.",

Here we present a similar construction based on consequential splitting of tetragons and other polygons with even number of edges. The suggested procedure is stochastic and results in the ensemble of planar scale-free graphs, in the limit of large number of splittings the degree distribution of the graph converges to a true power law with exponent, which is smaller than 3 in the case of tetragons, and larger than 3 for polygons with larger number of edges. We show that it is possible to stochastically mix tetragon-based and hexagon-based constructions to obtain an ensemble of graphs with tunable exponent of degree distribution. Other possible planar generalizations of the Apollonian procedure are also briefly discussed.",

Several thermodynamic theories attempt to explain the separation from the Fourier regime in such kind of systems. Here we develop a two temperature model to describe the non-Fourier regime from the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The basic assumption is the existence of two well separated length scales in the system, namely, one related with the matrix dimension (bulk) and the other with the characteristic length of the internal structure. Two Fourier type coupled transport equations are obtained for the temperatures which describe the heat conduction in each of the length scales. Recent experimental results from several groups on the thermal response of different structured materials are satisfactorily reproduced by using the coupling parameter as a fitting parameter. The similarities and differences of the present formalism with other theories are discussed.",

        "abstract": "In the present paper, we are interested in classifying of Collatz sequences on based to the different behavior of these sequences when their lengths tend to infinity. A Collatz infinite sequence can be defined as an infinite ordered set of positive integers such that the term of rank n is results of applying Collatz map n times to the first term. Such term can be expressed on the form Tn(P)=A(P,n)P+B(P,n). When n tends to infinity, each function among the two partial coefficients denoted by A(P,n) and B(P,n) behaves in different ways. This allows us to determine all categories of Collatz infinite sequences. First, we carry out a classification of Collatz infinite sequences on based of the different possible limits of the two coefficients. In second time, we determine the different proportions of every class of the infinite sequences. Note that results obtained do not represent a proof of a Collatz conjecture but they have a strong relationship with this conjecture and it allows us to better understand the behavior of Collatz sequences when n tend to infinity.",

Such decisions often impact their subjects' future characteristics and capabilities in an a priori unknown fashion. The decision-maker, therefore, faces exploration-exploitation dilemmas akin to those in multi-armed bandits. Following prior work, we model communities as arms. To capture the long-term effects of ML-based allocation decisions, we study a setting in which the reward from each arm evolves every time the decision-maker pulls that arm. We focus on reward functions that are initially increasing in the number of pulls but may become (and remain) decreasing after a certain point. We argue that an acceptable sequential allocation of opportunities must take an arm's potential for growth into account. We capture these considerations through the notion of policy regret, a much stronger notion than the often-studied external regret, and present an algorithm with provably sub-linear policy regret for sufficiently long time horizons. We empirically compare our algorithm with several baselines and find that it consistently outperforms them, in particular for long time horizons.",

We show the results comparing to various methods including the state-of-the-art. Our contribution includes a framework which takes triangular mesh as an input and produces voxelized data, a proof to an unproved algorithm that performs better than the state-of-the-art, and various experiments including parallelization built on the GPU and CPU.

A recent surge (second wave) in the COVID-19 cases in Europe and other temperate countries as compared to the tropical regions suggests the likely role of solar radiation. We hypothesized that ultraviolet radiation's effect might be a significant factor moderating the spread of the COVID-19 across countries. Regression analysis was done for the UV radiation data for seven hotspot cities (New Delhi, Mumbai, Milan, Madrid, New York, Melbourne and Sydney) with the daily COVID-19 cases. Global erythemal UV radiation values were lower during winter and higher during summer. In general, the daily new COVID-19 cases registered were higher during the winter months having low UV radiation dose (0.5-3.7 kJ m-2). Cases began to decline with summer onset that corresponded to increased UV radiation (2.5-6.7 kJ m-2). Our studies suggest that the natural UV radiation could be a strong determining factor moderating the spread of COVID-19 cases. The importance of UV radiation in natural sunlight as a disinfectant for SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ignored since the lockdowns were lifted; further, it can be considered as a factor for COVID management.",

By identifying these braids with emergent topological excitations of ribbon networks, it has been possible to encode this braid model into the framework of quantum geometry provided by loop quantum gravity. In the case of trivalent networks, it has not been possible to generate particle interactions, because the braids correspond to noiseless subsystems, meaning they commute with the evolution algebra generated by the local Pachner moves. In the case of tetravalent networks, interactions are only possible when the model's original simplicity, in which interactions take place via the composition of braids, is sacrificed. We demonstrate that it possible to preserve both the original classification of fermions, as well as their interaction via the braid product, if we embed the braid in a trivalent scheme, and supplement the local Pachner moves, with a non-local and graph changing 1-handle attachment. Moreover, we use Kauffman-Lins recoupling theory to obtain invariants of braided networks that distinguish topological configurations associated to particles in the Bilson-Thompson model.",

Inspired by this fact, we consider a model system and seek to understand the wall curvature driven dynamics of a squirmer, a mathematical model for a microswimmer, using (i) lattice Boltzmann simulations and (ii) analytical theory by \\citet{dario_gareth}. The instantaneous dynamics of the system is presented in terms of fluid velocity fields, and the translational and angular velocities of the microswimmer, whereas the long time dynamics is presented by plotting the squirmer trajectories near curved boundaries, as well as characterising them in terms of (i) proximity parameter, (ii) retention time, (iii) swimmer orientation and (iv) tangential velocity near the boundary, and (v) scattering angle during the collision. Our detailed analysis shows that irrespective of the type and strength, microswimmers exhibit a greater affinity towards a concave boundary due to hydrodynamic interactions compared to a convex boundary. In the presence of additional repulsive interactions with the boundary, we find that pullers (propel by forward thrust) have a slightly greater affinity towards the convex--curved walls compared to pushers (propel by backward thrust). Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the consequence of hydrodynamic interactions in a unified framework that encompasses the dynamics of pullers, pushers, and neutral swimmers in the neighbourhood of flat, concave, and convex walls. In addition, the combined effect of oppositely curved surfaces is studied by confining the squirmer in an annulus. The results presented in a unified framework and insights obtained are expected to be useful to design geometrical confinements to control and guide the motion of microswimmers in microfluidic applications.",

From recent work, we know that there is sparsity in transformers and that the floating-points within its computation can be discretized to fewer values with minimal loss to task accuracies. However, this requires retraining or even creating entirely new models, both of which can be expensive and carbon-emitting. Focused on optimizations that do not require training, we systematically study the full range of typical attention values necessary. This informs the design of an inference-time quantization technique using both pruning and log-scaled mapping which produces only a few (e.g. $2^3$) unique values. Over the tasks of question answering and sentiment analysis, we find nearly 80% of attention values can be pruned to zeros with minimal ($< 1.0\\%$) relative loss in accuracy. We use this pruning technique in conjunction with quantizing the attention values to only a 3-bit format, without retraining, resulting in only a 0.8% accuracy reduction on question answering with fine-tuned RoBERTa.",

Knowing the criteria and phase space geometry that govern escape events plays an important role in making use of such phenomenon, particularly when realistic frictional or dissipative forces are present. We aim to extend the study the escape dynamics around the saddle from two degrees of freedom to three degrees of freedom, presenting both a methodology and phase space structures. Both the ideal conservative system and a perturbed, dissipative system are considered. We define the five-dimensional transition region, $\\mathcal{T}_h$, as the set of initial conditions of a given initial energy $h$ for which the trajectories will escape from one side of the saddle to another. Invariant manifold arguments demonstrate that in the six-dimensional phase space, the boundary of the transition region, $\\partial \\mathcal{T}_h$, is topologically a four-dimensional hyper-cylinder in the conservative system, and a four-dimensional hyper-sphere in the dissipative system. The transition region $\\mathcal{T}_h$ can be constructed by a solid three-dimensional ellipsoid (solid three-dimensional cylinder) in the three-dimensional configuration space, where at each point, there is a cone of velocity -- the velocity directions leading to transition are given by cones, with velocity magnitude given by the initial energy and the direction by two spherical angles with given limits. To illustrate our analysis, we consider an example system which has two potential minima connected by an index 1 saddle.",

Simulation-based approaches are typically used to support design and Verification and Validation (V&V) of CPSs in several domains such as: aerospace, defence, automotive, smart grid and healthcare. Accordingly, many simulation-based tools are available, and this poses huge interoperability challenges. To overcome them, in 2010 the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) was proposed as an open standard to support both Model Exchange (ME) and Co-Simulation (CS). Models adhering to such a standard are called Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs). FMUs play an essential role in defining complex CPSs through, e.g., the SSP standard. Simulation-based V&V of CPSs typically requires exploring different scenarios (i.e., exogenous CPS input sequences), many of them showing a shared prefix. Accordingly, the simulator state at the end of a shared prefix is saved and then restored and used as a start state for the simulation of the next scenario. In this context, an important FMI feature is the capability to save and restore the internal FMU state on demand. Unfortunately, the implementation of this feature is not mandatory and it is available only within some commercial software. This motivates developing such a feature for open-source CPS simulation environments. In this paper, we focus on JModelica, an open-source modelling and simulation environment for CPSs defined in the Modelica language. We describe how we have endowed JModelica with our open-source implementation of the FMI 2.0 functions to save and restore internal states of FMUs for ME. Furthermore, we present results evaluating, through 934 benchmark models, correctness and efficiency of our extended JModelica. Our results show that simulation-based V&V is, on average, 22 times faster with our get/set functionality than without it.",

Both two schemes enjoy stochastic $Q$-matrix structures and can be decomposed as a gradient flow part and a Hamiltonian flow part, which enable us to prove unconditional stability, ergodicity and error estimates. Based on two upwind schemes, several numerical examples - including sampling accelerated by a mixture flow, image transformations and simulations for stochastic model of chaotic system - are conducted. These two structure-preserving schemes also give a natural random walk approximation for a generic irreversible drift-diffusion process on a manifold. Thus they can be adapted to manifold-related computations induced from high dimensional molecular dynamics.",

This allows us to draw upon the simplicity and scalability of the Transformer architecture, and associated advances in language modeling such as GPT-x and BERT. In particular, we present Decision Transformer, an architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. Unlike prior approaches to RL that fit value functions or compute policy gradients, Decision Transformer simply outputs the optimal actions by leveraging a causally masked Transformer. By conditioning an autoregressive model on the desired return (reward), past states, and actions, our Decision Transformer model can generate future actions that achieve the desired return. Despite its simplicity, Decision Transformer matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art model-free offline RL baselines on Atari, OpenAI Gym, and Key-to-Door tasks.",

        "abstract": "Einstein's most famous equation -- $E=mc^2$ -- generated a short-circuit between the concepts of mass and energy, which also affects other concepts like matter, radiation, and vacuum. Physics currently has a mixture of classical, relativistic, and quantum concepts of mass, which generates a great deal of confusion and many problems. Clear definitions need to be established if one wants to avoid ghost hunting. In particular, by abandoning the idea of mass and focusing on time and energy, some interesting implications are emerging. There might be an intriguing relationship between the dark energy, as the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic field, and the Cosmic Microwave Background epoch, as its horizon. This might also be the hint of an expanding and rotating universe. An observational test is proposed to verify this hypothesis. I would like to share some reflections on this topic, without claiming any conclusive recipe.",

We use the relativistic N-body code gevolution with its exact integration of lightlike geodesics which include all relativistic scalar contributions to the number counts. We compare our non-perturbative numerical results with the results from CLASS using the Halofit approximation for the non-linear matter power spectrum. We find that the Halofit approximation is excellent for both, the density field and the convergence, but it cannot accurately model redshift-space distortions. We also find that the largest contribution to the unequal-redshift power spectra is the cross-correlation of the density and the lensing contribution to the number count, especially for redshift bins that are far apart. Correlating the number counts with the convergence map we find that the signal is dominated by the lensing-lensing term when the convergence field redshift is not higher than the number count one, while it is dominated by the density-lensing term in the opposite case. In the present study, the issue of galaxy bias is deliberately left aside by considering only unbiased samples of matter particles from the simulations.",

The nature of light sources, tracking mode of the telescope, point spread function (PSF), and specifications of the CCD are taken into account in the imaging process. Photometric images in a variety of observation scenarios can be generated flexibly. We compared the simulated images with the observed ones. The residuals between them are negligible, and the correlation coefficients between them are high, with a median of $0.9379_{-0.0201}^{+0.0125}$ for 1020 pairs of images, which means a high fidelity and similarity. The method is versatile and can be used to plan future photometry of moving targets, interpret existing observations, and provide test images for image processing algorithms.",

Here, we explain an asymmetry emerging upon repeating identical isotropic (uniformly random) operations. Specifically, in two dimensions, repeating an isotropic rotation twice maps a given point on the two-dimensional unit sphere (the unit circle) uniformly at random to any point on the unit sphere, reflecting a statistical symmetry as expected. In contrast, in three and higher dimensions, a point is mapped more often closer to the original point than a uniform distribution predicts. Curiously, in the limit of the dimension $d \\rightarrow \\infty$, a symmetric distribution is approached again. We intuitively explain the emergence of this asymmetry and why it disappears in higher dimensions by disentangling isotropic rotations into a sequence of partial actions. The asymmetry emerges in two qualitatively different forms and for a wide range of general random operations relevant in complex systems modeling, including repeated continuous and discrete rotations, roto-reflections and general orthogonal transformations",

In addition, the paper also proposes a polynomial-time algorithm for computing one contrastive explanation. These novel algorithms build on explanation graphs (XpG's). XpG's denote a graph representation that enables both theoretical and practically efficient computation of explanations for decision graphs. Furthermore, the paper pro- poses a practically efficient solution for the enumeration of explanations, and studies the complexity of deciding whether a given feature is included in some explanation. For the concrete case of decision trees, the paper shows that the set of all contrastive explanations can be enumerated in polynomial time.

We call it the soliton wall. We prove that in the asymptotic region, the n-soliton solution possesses n isolated localized lumps of action density where each lump is a soliton wall. The n intersecting soliton walls preserve their shapes and \"velocities\" in the scattering process with position shifts of their peaks (known as the phase shifts). We calculate the phase shift factors explicitly and find that the action densities can be real-valued in the asymptotic region in four dimensional real spaces with signatures of the Euclidean, the Minkowski, and the Ultrahyperbolic. Furthermore, we show that the gauge group can be G=U(2) in the Ultrahyperbolic signature. This implies that the intersecting soliton walls are realized in all region in N=2 string theories.

The purpose of this study is to extract new LVMD parameters from the phase analysis of gated SPECT MPI by deep learning to help CRT patient selection. Methods. One hundred and three patients who underwent rest gated SPECT MPI were enrolled in this study. CRT response was defined as a decrease in left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) >= 15% at 6 +- 1 month follow up. Autoencoder (AE), an unsupervised deep learning method, was trained by the raw LV systolic phase polar maps to extract new LVMD parameters, called AE-based LVMD parameters. Correlation analysis was used to explain the relationships between new parameters with conventional LVMD parameters. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to establish a multivariate model for predicting CRT response. Results. Complete data were obtained in 102 patients, 44.1% of them were classified as CRT responders. AE-based LVMD parameter was significant in the univariate (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07 - 1.44, P = 0.006) and multivariate analyses (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.06, P = 0.006). Moreover, it had incremental value over PSD (AUC 0.72 vs. 0.63, LH 8.06, P = 0.005) and PBW (AUC 0.72 vs. 0.64, LH 7.87, P = 0.005), combined with significant clinic characteristics, including LVEF and gender. Conclusions. The new LVMD parameters extracted by autoencoder from the baseline gated SPECT MPI has the potential to improve the prediction of CRT response.",

        "abstract": "Progressively applying Gaussian noise transforms complex data distributions to approximately Gaussian. Reversing this dynamic defines a generative model. When the forward noising process is given by a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE), Song et al. (2021) demonstrate how the time inhomogeneous drift of the associated reverse-time SDE may be estimated using score-matching. A limitation of this approach is that the forward-time SDE must be run for a sufficiently long time for the final distribution to be approximately Gaussian. In contrast, solving the Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge problem (SB), i.e. an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem on path spaces, yields diffusions which generate samples from the data distribution in finite time. We present Diffusion SB (DSB), an original approximation of the Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure to solve the SB problem, and provide theoretical analysis along with generative modeling experiments. The first DSB iteration recovers the methodology proposed by Song et al. (2021), with the flexibility of using shorter time intervals, as subsequent DSB iterations reduce the discrepancy between the final-time marginal of the forward (resp. backward) SDE with respect to the prior (resp. data) distribution. Beyond generative modeling, DSB offers a widely applicable computational optimal transport tool as the continuous state-space analogue of the popular Sinkhorn algorithm (Cuturi, 2013).",

Although electron-phonon interaction has been suggested by various time-resolved measurements to be important for the relaxation dynamics of graphene, the lack of energy- and momentum-resolved self-energy dynamics prohibits direct identification of the role of specific phonon modes in the relaxation dynamics. Here by performing time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on a Kekul\u00e9-ordered graphene with folded Dirac cones at the $\\Gamma$ point, we have succeeded in resolving the self-energy effect induced by coupling of electrons to two phonons at $\\Omega_1$ = 177 meV and $\\Omega_2$ = 54 meV and revealing its dynamical change in the time domain. Moreover, these strongly coupled phonons define energy thresholds, which separate the hierarchical relaxation dynamics from ultrafast, fast to slow, thereby providing direct experimental evidence for the dominant role of mode-specific phonons in the relaxation dynamics",

A cousin $d_{xy}+id_{3z^2-r^2}$ pairing also accommodating eight corner Majorana modes, by virtue of breaking the cubic symmetry, in contrast, yields an \\emph{extrinsic} TOTSC. We identify doped octupolar (topological or trivial) Dirac insulator as the suitable platform to sustain such unconventional superconductors, realized from an intraunit cell pairing. Finally, we argue that the proposed TOTSC can be experimentally realizable in NaCl and other structurally similar compounds under high pressure.",

The neutrinos in the model get their masses from a standard inverse-seesaw mechanism while an added scalar sector is responsible for the breaking of the gauged $U(1)$ leading to a light neutral gauge boson ($Z'$) which has minimal interaction with the SM sector. We study the phenomenology of having such a light $Z'$ in the context of neutrinophilic interactions as well as the role of allowing kinetic mixing between the new $U(1)$ group with the SM hypercharge group. We show that current experimental searches allow for a very light $Z'$ if it does not couple to SM fields directly and highlight the search strategies at the LHC. We observe that multi-lepton final states in the form of $(4\\ell + \\mET)$ and $(3\\ell + 2j + \\mET)$ could be crucial in discovering such a neutrinophilic gauge boson lying in a mass range of $200$--$500$ GeV.",

However, a statistically significant periodic model might not originate from a strictly periodic source. In astronomy in particular, one expects transient signals that show periodicity for a certain amount of time before vanishing. This situation is encountered for instance in the search for planets in radial velocity data. While planetary signals are expected to have a stable phase, amplitude and frequency - except when strong planet-planet interactions are present - signals induced by stellar activity will typically not exhibit the same stability. In the present article, we explore the use of periodic functions multiplied by time windows to diagnose whether an apparently periodic signal is truly so. We suggest diagnostics to check whether a signal is consistently present in the time series, and has a stable phase, amplitude and period. The tests are expressed both in a periodogram and Bayesian framework. Our methods are applied to the Solar HARPS-N data as well as HD 215152, HD 69830 and HD 13808. We find that (i) the HARPS-N Solar data exhibits signals at the Solar rotation period and its first harmonic ($\\sim$ 13.4 days). The frequency and phase of the 13.4 days signal appear constant within the estimation uncertainties, but its amplitude presents significant variations which can be mapped to activity levels. (ii) as previously reported, we find four, three and two planets orbiting HD 215152, HD 69830 and HD 13808.",

We leverage the open-source library astminer to extract path-contexts from the abstract syntax trees of a corpus of labeled C functions. Code2vec is trained on the resulting path-contexts with the task of classifying a function as vulnerable or non-vulnerable. Using the CodeXGLUE benchmark, we show that the accuracy of Code2vec for this task is comparable to simple transformer-based methods such as pre-trained RoBERTa, and outperforms more naive NLP-based methods. We achieved an accuracy of 61.43% while maintaining low computational requirements relative to larger models.",

They have been suggested to be the potential Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) sources in the low-frequency region. Several channels for the formation of UCXBs have been proposed so far. In this article, we carried out a systematic study on the He star donor channel, in which a neutron star (NS) accretes matter from a He main-sequence star through Roche-lobe overflow, where the mass-transfer is driven by the gravitational wave radiation. Firstly, we followed the long-term evolution of the NS+He main-sequence star binaries by employing the stellar evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, and thereby obtained the initial parameter spaces for the production of UCXBs. We then used these results to perform a detailed binary population synthesis approach to obtain the Galactic rates of UCXBs through this channel. We estimate the Galactic rates of UCXBs appearing as LISA sources to be $\\sim3.1-11.9\\times10^{-6} \\rm yr^{-1}$ through this channel, and the number of such UCXB-LISA sources in the Galaxy can reach about $100-390$. The present work indicates that the He star donor channel cannot be ignored in forming UCXB-LISA sources. We found that the evolutionary tracks of UCXBs through this channel can account for the location of the five transient sources with relatively long orbital periods quite well. We also found that such UCXBs can be identified by their locations in the period-mass transfer rate diagram.",

The proposed method is based on the q-gradient which is also known as Jackson derivative. In contrast to the conventional gradient, which finds the tangent, the q-gradient finds the secant of the function and takes larger steps towards the optimal solution. The proposed $q$-RBFNN is analyzed for its convergence performance in the context of least square algorithm. In particular, a closed form expression of the Wiener solution is obtained, and stability bounds of the learning rate (step-size) is derived. The analytical results are validated through computer simulation. Additionally, we propose an adaptive technique for the time-varying $q$-parameter to improve convergence speed with no trade-offs in the steady state performance.",

One of the most basic insights is the fact that some mixed states can feature entanglement across every possible cut of a multipartite system, yet can be produced via a mixture of partially separable states. To distinguish states that genuinely cannot be produced from mixing partially separable states, the term genuine multipartite entanglement was coined. All these considerations originate in a paradigm where only a single copy of the state is distributed and locally acted upon. In contrast, advances in quantum technologies prompt the question of how this picture changes when multiple copies of the same state become locally accessible. Here we show that multiple copies unlock genuine multipartite entanglement from partially separable states, even from undistillable ensembles, and even more than two copies can be required to observe this effect. With these findings, we characterise the notion of partial separability in the paradigm of multiple copies and conjecture a strict hierarchy of activatable states and an asymptotic collapse of hierarchy.",

There are no new scalars and hence no new hierarchy puzzles beyond those associated with the Higgs; the only new particles at the TeV scale are vector-like singlet and doublet leptons. Interestingly, this simple model provides a calculable example violating the Wilsonian notion of naturalness: despite the absence of any symmetries prohibiting its generation, the coefficient of the naively leading dimension-six operator for $(g-2)$ vanishes at one-loop. While effective field theorists interpret this either as a surprising UV cancellation of power divergences, or as a delicate cancellation between matching UV and calculable IR corrections to $(g-2)$ from parametrically separated scales, there is a simple explanation in the full theory:~the loop integrand is a total derivative of a function vanishing in both the deep UV and IR. The leading contribution to $(g-2)$ arises from dimension-eight operators, and thus the required masses of new fermions are lower than naively expected, with a sizeable portion of parameter space already covered by direct searches at the LHC. The remaining parameter space free of fine-tuning for the muon mass will be fully covered by future direct LHC searches, and {\\it all} of the parameter space can be probed by precision measurements at planned future lepton colliders.",

Our starting point is a careful computation of the disk partition function to all orders in the perturbative expansion in the cutoff parameter. We show that the perturbative series is asymptotic and that it admits a precise completion exploiting the analytical properties of its Borel transform, as prescribed by resurgence theory. The final result is then naturally interpreted in terms of the nonperturbative branch of the $T\\bar{T}$-deformed spectrum. The finite-cutoff trumpet partition function is computed by applying the same strategy. In the second part of the paper, we propose an extension of this formalism to arbitrary topologies, using the basic gluing rules of the undeformed case. The Weil-Petersson integrations can be safely performed due to the nonperturbative corrections and give results that are compatible with the flow equation associated with the $T\\bar{T}$ deformation. We derive exact expressions for general topologies and show that these are captured by a suitable deformation of the Eynard-Orantin topological recursion.

        "abstract": "Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star gets torn apart by the strong tidal forces of a supermassive black hole, which results in the formation of a debris stream that partly falls back towards the compact object. This gas moves along inclined orbital planes that intersect near pericenter, resulting in a so-called \"nozzle shock\". We perform the first dedicated study of this interaction, making use of a two-dimensional simulation that follows the transverse gas evolution inside a given section of stream. This numerical approach circumvents the lack of resolution encountered near pericenter passage in global three-dimensional simulations using particle-based methods. As it moves inward, we find that the gas motion is purely ballistic, which near pericenter causes strong vertical compression that squeezes the stream into a thin sheet. Dissipation takes place at the resulting nozzle shock, inducing a rise in pressure that causes the collapsing gas to bounce back, although without imparting significant net expansion. As it recedes to larger distances, this matter continues to expand while remaining thin despite the influence of pressure forces. This gas evolution specifies the strength of the subsequent self-crossing shock, which we find to be more affected by black hole spin than previously estimated. We also evaluate the impact of general-relativistic effects, viscous dissipation, magnetic fields and radiative processes on the nozzle shock. This study represents an important step forward in the theoretical understanding of TDEs, bridging the gap between our robust knowledge of the fallback rate and the more complex following stages, during which most of the emission occurs.",

This is not reproduced by current cosmological simulations, and supernova-driven outflows are not effective in such massive haloes. We address a hybrid scenario where post-compaction merging satellites heat up the dark-matter cusps by dynamical friction, allowing AGN-driven outflows to generate cores. Using analytic and semi-analytic models (SatGen), we estimate the dynamical-friction heating as a function of satellite compactness for a cosmological sequence of mergers. Cosmological simulations (VELA) demonstrate that satellites of initial virial masses $>\\!10^{11.3}M_\\odot$, that undergo wet compactions, become sufficiently compact for significant heating. Constituting a major fraction of the accretion onto haloes $\\geq\\!10^{12}M_\\odot$, these satellites heat-up the cusps in half a virial time at $z\\!\\sim\\! 2$. Using a model for outflow-driven core formation (CuspCore), we demonstrate that the heated dark-matter cusps develop extended cores in response to removal of half the gas mass, while the more compact stellar systems remain intact. The mergers keep the dark matter hot, while the gas supply, fresh and recycled, is sufficient for the AGN outflows. AGN indeed become effective in haloes $\\geq\\!10^{12}M_\\odot$, where the black-hole growth is no longer suppressed by supernovae and its compaction-driven rapid growth is maintained by a hot CGM. For simulations to reproduce the dynamical-friction effects, they should resolve the compaction of the massive satellites and avoid artificial tidal disruption. AGN feedback could be boosted by clumpy black-hole accretion and clumpy response to AGN.",

When accounting for the variation in their kinematic profiles, we show that the NV/CIV, (SiIV+OIV])/CIV and NV/Lya line ratios do not vary as a function of the quasar continuum luminosity, black hole mass, or accretion rate. Using photoionization models from CLOUDY , we further show that the observed changes in these line ratios can be explained by emission from gas with solar abundances, if the physical conditions of the emitting gas are allowed to vary over a broad range of densities and ionizing fluxes. The diversity of broad line emission in quasar spectra can be explained by a model with emission from two kinematically distinct regions, where the line ratios suggest that these regions have either very different metallicity or density. Both simplicity and current galaxy evolution models suggest that near-solar abundances, with parts of the spectrum forming in high-density clouds, are more likely. Within this paradigm, objects with stronger outflow signatures show stronger emission from gas which is denser and located closer to the ionizing source, at radii consistent with simulations of line-driven disc-winds. Studies using broad-line ratios to infer chemical enrichment histories should consider changes in density and ionizing flux before estimating metallicities.",

In such situations, however, the many-body Kubo formula from linear response theory, involving matrix elements of the current operator computed with many-body wavefunctions, remains valid. Working directly in the many-body Hilbert space and not making any reference to quasiparticles (or lack thereof), we address the puzzle of linear in temperature ($T$-linear) resistivity seen in non-Fermi liquid phases that occur in several strongly correlated condensed matter systems. We derive a simple criterion for the occurrence of $T$-linear resistivity based on an analysis of the contributions to the many-body Kubo formula, determined by an energy invariant \"$f$-function\" involving current matrix elements and energy eigenvalues that describes the DC conductivity of the system in the microcanonical ensemble. Using full diagonalization, we test this criterion for the $f$-function in the spinless nearest neighbor Hubbard model, and in a system of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev dots coupled by weak single particle hopping. We also study the $f$-function for the spin conductivity in the 2D Heisenberg model with similar conclusions. Our work suggests that a general principle, formulated in terms of many-body Hilbert space concepts, is at the core of the occurrence of $T$-linear resistivity in a wide range of systems, and precisely translates $T$-linear resistivity into a notion of energy scale invariance far beyond what is typically associated with quantum critical points.",

They achieve this through in-depth theoretical analyses and experiential heuristics. However, there is no known general-purpose procedure for rigorously evaluating whether newly proposed models indeed successfully learn from data. We show that such a procedure cannot exist. For PAC binary classification, uniform and universal online learning, and exact learning through teacher-learner interactions, learnability is in general undecidable, both in the sense of independence of the axioms in a formal system and in the sense of uncomputability. Our proofs proceed via computable constructions of function classes that encode the consistency problem for formal systems and the halting problem for Turing machines into complexity measures that characterize learnability. Our work shows that undecidability appears in the theoretical foundations of machine learning: There is no one-size-fits-all algorithm for deciding whether a machine learning model can be successful. We cannot in general automatize the process of assessing new learning models.",

Aims. We aim to characterize the physical properties of this new GC and place it in the context of the Milky Way, exploring its possible connection with the known GC NGC 6544 and with the Hrid halo stream. Methods. VVV-CL160 was originally detected in the VISTA Variables in the V\u00eda L\u00e1ctea (VVV) survey. We use the proper motions (PMs) from the updated VVV Infrared Astrometric Catalog (VIRAC2) to select GC members and make deep near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) to study the cluster properties. We also fit King models to the decontaminated sample to determine the GC structural parameters. Results. VVV-CL160 has an unusually large PM for a Galactic GC as measured with VIRAC2 and Gaia EDR3: $\\mu_{\\alpha}\\cos(\\delta)$ = $-2.3 \\pm 0.1 $ mas yr$^{-1}$ and $\\mu_{\\delta}$ = $-16.8 \\pm 0.1 $ mas yr$^{-1}$. The kinematics are similar to those of the known GC NGC 6544 and the Hrid halo stream. We estimate a reddening of $E(J-K) = 1.95$ mag and an extinction of $A_{k}= 1.40$ mag for VVV-CL160. We also measure a distance modulus of $(m-M) = 13.01$ mag and a distance of $D_{\\odot} = 4.0 \\pm 0.5$ kpc. This places the GC at $z=29$ pc above the Galactic plane and at a galactocentric distance of $R_G=4.2$ kpc. We also measure a metallicity of $[Fe/H] = -1.4 \\pm 0.2$ dex for an adopted age of $t=12$ Gyr; King model fits of the PM-decontaminated sample reveal a concentrated GC, with core radius $r_{c}= 22.8\"$ and tidal radius $r_{t}= 50'$. .... We also explore the possible association of this new GC with other GCs and halo streams. Conclusions. Based on the locations and kinematics, we suggest that VVV-CL160, along with NGC 6544, may be associated with the extension of the Hrid halo stream.",

While it appears that for extremal Kerr black holes arbitrarily high center of mass energies could be achieved, several works pointed out that both theoretical as well as astrophysical arguments would severely dampen the attainable energies. In this work we study particle collisions near Kerr--Newman black holes, by reviewing and extending previously proposed scenarios. Most importantly, we implement the hoop conjecture for all cases and we discuss the astrophysical relevance of these collisional Penrose processes. The outcome of this investigation is that scenarios involving near-horizon target particles are in principle able to attain, sub-Planckian, but still ultra high, center of mass energies of the order of $10^{21}-10^{23}$ eV. Thus, these target particle collisional Penrose processes could contribute to the observed spectrum of ultra high-energy cosmic rays, even if the hoop conjecture is taken into account, and as such deserve further scrutiny in realistic settings.",

        "abstract": "The recent discovery of electromagnetic signals in coincidence with neutron-star mergers has solidified the importance of multimessenger campaigns in studying the most energetic astrophysical events. Pioneering multimessenger observatories, such as LIGO/Virgo and IceCube, record many candidate signals below the detection significance threshold. These sub-threshold event candidates are promising targets for multimessenger studies, as the information provided by them may, when combined with contemporaneous gamma-ray observations, lead to significant detections. Here we describe a new method that uses such candidates to search for transient events using archival very-high-energy gamma-ray data from imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). We demonstrate the application of this method to sub-threshold binary neutron star (BNS) merger candidates identified in Advanced LIGO's first observing run. We identify eight hours of archival VERITAS observations coincident with seven BNS merger candidates and search them for TeV emission. No gamma-ray emission is detected; we calculate upper limits on the integral flux and compare them to a short gamma-ray burst model. We anticipate this search method to serve as a starting point for IACT searches with future LIGO/Virgo data releases as well as in other sub-threshold studies for multimessenger transients, such as IceCube neutrinos. Furthermore, it can be deployed immediately with other current-generation IACTs, and has the potential for real-time use that places minimal burden on experimental operations. Lastly, this method may serve as a pilot for studies with the Cherenkov Telescope Array, which has the potential to observe even larger fields of view in its divergent pointing mode.",

(2020) presented the discovery of WISEA J041451.67-585456.7 and WISEA J181006.18-101000.5, which appear to be the first examples of extreme T-type subdwarfs (esdTs; metallicity <= -1 dex, T_eff <= 1400 K). Here we present new discoveries and follow-up of three T-type subdwarf candidates, with an eye toward expanding the sample of such objects with very low metallicity and extraordinarily high kinematics, properties that suggest membership in the Galactic halo. Keck/NIRES near-infrared spectroscopy of WISEA J155349.96+693355.2, a fast-moving object discovered by the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 citizen science project, confirms that it is a mid-T subdwarf. With H_W2 = 22.3 mag, WISEA J155349.96+693355.2 has the largest W2 reduced proper motion among all spectroscopically confirmed L and T subdwarfs, suggesting that it may be kinematically extreme. Nevertheless, our modeling of the WISEA J155349.96+693355.2 near-infrared spectrum indicates that its metallicity is only mildly subsolar. In analyzing the J155349.96+693355.2 spectrum, we present a new grid of low-temperature, low-metallicity model atmosphere spectra. We also present the discoveries of two new esdT candidates, CWISE J073844.52-664334.6 and CWISE J221706.28-145437.6, based on their large motions and colors similar to those of the two known esdT objects. Finding more esdT examples is a critical step toward mapping out the spectral sequence and observational properties of this newly identified population.",

Examples are variational quantum eigensolvers, quantum approximate optimization algorithms as well as various algorithms in the context of quantum-assisted machine learning. A common bottleneck of any such algorithm is constituted by the optimization of the variational parameters. A popular set of optimization methods work on the estimate of the gradient, obtained by means of circuit evaluations. We will refer to the way in which one can combine these circuit evaluations as gradient rules. This work provides a comprehensive picture of the family of gradient rules that vary parameters of quantum gates individually. The most prominent known members of this family are the parameter shift rule and the finite differences method. To unite this family, we propose a generalized parameter shift rule that expresses all members of the aforementioned family as special cases, and discuss how all of these can be seen as providing access to a linear combination of exact first- and second-order derivatives. We further prove that a parameter shift rule with one non-shifted evaluation and only one shifted circuit evaluation can not exist does not exist, and introduce a novel perspective for approaching new gradient rules.",

We consider a 9.6-$M_{\\odot}$ zero-metallicity progenitor starting from both 2D and 3D CHIMERA models, and a 10-$M_{\\odot}$ solar-metallicity progenitor starting from a 2D CHIMERA model, all simulated until shock breakout in 3D while tracking 160 nuclear species. The relative velocity difference between the supernova shock and the metal-rich Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) \"bullets\" determines how the ejecta evolves as it propagates through the density profile of the progenitor and dictates the final morphology of the explosion. We find maximum $^{56}\\rm{Ni}$ velocities of ${\\sim} 1950~\\rm{km~s}^{-1}$ and ${\\sim} 1750~\\rm{km~s}^{-1}$ at shock breakout from 2D and 3D 9.6-$M_{\\odot}$ CHIMERA models, respectively, due to the bullets' ability to penetrate the He/H shell. When mapping from 2D, we find that the development of higher velocity structures is suppressed when the 2D CHIMERA model and 3D FLASH model meshes are aligned. The development of faster growing spherical-bubble structures, as opposed to the slower growing toroidal structure imposed by axisymmetry, allows for interaction of the bullets with the shock and seeds further R-T instabilities at the He/H interface. We see similar effects in the 10-$M_{\\odot}$ model, which achieves maximum $^{56}\\rm{Ni}$ velocities of ${\\sim} 2500~\\rm{km~s}^{-1}$ at shock breakout.",

We use a perturbative analytical approach to study the dynamics of exchange-coupled quantum dots with valley degrees of freedom. We show that if the valley splitting is large and electrons are not properly initialized to valley eigenstates, then time evolution of the system will lead to spin-valley entanglement. Spin-valley entanglement will also occur if the valley splitting is small and electrons are not initialized to the same valley state. Additionally, we show that for small valley splitting, spin-valley entanglement does not affect measurement probabilities of two-qubit systems; however, systems with more qubits will be affected. This means that two-qubit gate fidelities measured in two-qubit systems may miss the effects of valley degrees of freedom. Our work shows how the existence of valleys may adversely affect multiqubit fidelities even when the system temperature is very low.",

Modifications to VBS processes are also predicted in models of physics beyond the SM (BSM), for example through changes to the Higgs boson couplings to gauge bosons and the resonant production of new particles. In this review, experimental results and theoretical developments of VBS at the Large Hadron Collider, its high luminosity upgrade, and future colliders are presented.",

        "abstract": "In the Milky Way, $\\sim$18 Wolf-Rayet+O (WR+O) binaries are known with estimates of their stellar and orbital parameters. Whereas black hole+O (BH+O) binaries are thought to evolve from the former, only one such system is known in the Milky Way. To resolve this disparity, it was suggested that upon core collapse, the WR stars receive large kicks such that most of the binaries are disrupted. We reassess this issue, with emphasis on the uncertainty in the formation of an accretion disk around wind-accreting BHs in BH+O binaries, which is key to identifying such systems. We follow the methodology of previous work and apply an improved analytic criterion for the formation of an accretion disk around wind accreting BHs. We then use stellar models to predict the properties of the BH+O binaries which are expected to descend from the observed WR+O binaries, if the WR stars would form BHs without a natal kick. We find that disk formation depends sensitively on the O stars' wind velocity, the specific angular momentum carried by the wind, the efficiency of angular momentum accretion by the BH, and the spin of the BH. We show that the assumption of a low wind velocity may lead to predicting that most of the BH+O star binaries will have an extended X-ray bright period. However, this is not the case when typical wind velocities of O stars are considered. We find that a high spin of the BH can boost the duration of the X-ray active phase as well as the X-ray brightness during this phase, producing a strong bias for detecting high mass BH binaries in X-rays with high BH spin parameters. We conclude that large BH formation kicks are not required to understand the sparsity of X-ray bright BH+O stars in the Milky Way. Probing for a population of X-ray silent BH+O systems with alternative methods can inform us about BH kicks and the conditions for high energy emission from high mass BH binaries. (Abridged)",

To identify the presence and locations of the AR upflows we derive relative Doppler velocity maps by fitting a Gaussian function to {\\it Hinode}/EIS Fe XII 192.394\\,\u00c5 line profiles. To determine whether there is a high speed asymmetric component present in the AR upflows we fit a double Gaussian function to the Fe XII 192.394\\,\u00c5 mean spectrum that is computed in a region of interest situated in the AR upflows. Upflows are observed at both the east and west boundaries of all ARs in our sample with average upflow velocities ranging between -5 to -26~km s$^{-1}$. A blue wing asymmetry is present in every line profile. The intensity ratio between the minor high speed asymmetric Gaussian component compared to the main component is relatively small for the majority of regions however, in a minority of cases (8/30) the ratios are large and range between 20 to 56~\\%. These results suggest that upflows and the high speed asymmetric blue wing component are a common feature of all ARs.",

However, assessing the design quality of a program is a much more difficult and nuanced problem. Design quality is an important consideration since it affects the readability and maintainability of programs. Assessing design quality and giving personalized feedback is very time consuming task for instructors and teaching assistants. This limits the scale of giving personalized feedback to small class settings. Further, design quality is nuanced and is difficult to concisely express as a set of rules. For these reasons, we propose a neural network model to both automatically assess the design of a program and provide personalized feedback to guide students on how to make corrections. The model's effectiveness is evaluated on a corpus of student programs written in Python. The model has an accuracy rate from 83.67% to 94.27%, depending on the dataset, when predicting design scores as compared to historical instructor assessment. Finally, we present a study where students tried to improve the design of their programs based on the personalized feedback produced by the model. Students who participated in the study improved their program design scores by 19.58%.",

Recently, Transformers -- originally introduced in natural language processing -- have been increasingly adopted in computer vision. While early adopters continue to employ CNN backbones, the latest networks are end-to-end CNN-free Transformer solutions. A recent surprising finding shows that a simple MLP based solution without any traditional convolutional or Transformer components can produce effective visual representations. While CNNs, Transformers and MLP-Mixers may be considered as completely disparate architectures, we provide a unified view showing that they are in fact special cases of a more general method to aggregate spatial context in a neural network stack. We present the \\model (CONText AggregatIon NEtwoRk), a general-purpose building block for multi-head context aggregation that can exploit long-range interactions \\emph{a la} Transformers while still exploiting the inductive bias of the local convolution operation leading to faster convergence speeds, often seen in CNNs. In contrast to Transformer-based methods that do not scale well to downstream tasks that rely on larger input image resolutions, our efficient network, named \\modellight, can be employed in object detection and instance segmentation networks such as DETR, RetinaNet and Mask-RCNN to obtain an impressive detection mAP of 38.9, 43.8, 45.1 and mask mAP of 41.3, providing large improvements of 6.6, 7.3, 6.9 and 6.6 pts respectively, compared to a ResNet-50 backbone with a comparable compute and parameter size.

The average flux densities were estimated in 113 pulsars at two frequencies of 325 and 610 MHz using interferometric imaging. The average profile and single pulse emission in each pulsar were calibrated using the estimated flux density. We have used the flux calibrated average profile to study the variation of the spectral index across the emission beam in 21 pulsars where the core, inner cone and the outer conal components could be clearly identified. The central core component showed a steeper increase in emission at the lower frequency compared with conal emission, with an average difference in spectral index $\\delta\\alpha_{core-cone}\\sim-0.7$ between the core and the conal components in this frequency range. In contrast the inner conal components had positive difference in their spectral index compared to the outer cones with average difference $\\delta\\alpha_{in-out}\\sim+0.3$. The variation in the spectral index across the pulse window should provide valuable inputs for constraining the radio emission processes. The single pulse emission showed the presence of emission mode changing in 12 pulsars with 3 cases where the phenomenon is being reported for the first time. In addition we have also detected enhanced emission for short durations or flaring, in parts or across the entire emission window in 14 pulsars. The sudden changes in the emission during mode changing as well as these bursting states are unrelated to the emission mechanism and suggest the presence of rapid and repetitive changes during the plasma generation process.",

Related to their loop nature these moments can largely depend on the UV completion at the origin of the four-fermion operators. We illustrate this property by considering explicitly two simple ways to generate these operators, from $t$- or $s$-channel tree-level exchange. Fixing the strength of these interactions from the DM relic density constraint, we obtain in particular a magnetic moment that, depending on the interaction considered, lies typically between $10^{-20}$ to $10^{-23}$ ecm or identically vanishes. These non-vanishing values induce, via photon exchange, DM-nucleus scattering cross sections that could be probed by current or near future direct detection experiments.",

        "abstract": "Learning to reach goal states and learning diverse skills through mutual information (MI) maximization have been proposed as principled frameworks for self-supervised reinforcement learning, allowing agents to acquire broadly applicable multitask policies with minimal reward engineering. Starting from a simple observation that the standard goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) is encapsulated by the optimization objective of variational empowerment, we discuss how GCRL and MI-based RL can be generalized into a single family of methods, which we name variational GCRL (VGCRL), interpreting variational MI maximization, or variational empowerment, as representation learning methods that acquire functionally-aware state representations for goal reaching. This novel perspective allows us to: (1) derive simple but unexplored variants of GCRL to study how adding small representation capacity can already expand its capabilities; (2) investigate how discriminator function capacity and smoothness determine the quality of discovered skills, or latent goals, through modifying latent dimensionality and applying spectral normalization; (3) adapt techniques such as hindsight experience replay (HER) from GCRL to MI-based RL; and lastly, (4) propose a novel evaluation metric, named latent goal reaching (LGR), for comparing empowerment algorithms with different choices of latent dimensionality and discriminator parameterization. Through principled mathematical derivations and careful experimental studies, our work lays a novel foundation from which to evaluate, analyze, and develop representation learning techniques in goal-based RL.",

A total of 266 finished responses were analyzed using text mining, factor analysis, and regression analysis. Results showed that respondents knew about AVs and driving assistance technologies. Respondents welcome AV-transit integration but were unsure about its potential impacts. Technology-savvy respondents were more positive but had more concerns about AV-transit integration than others. Respondents who enjoyed driving were not necessarily against transit, as they were more positive about AV-transit integration and were more willing to use automated buses than those who did not enjoy driving as much.

The avalanches in this model correspond to the inter-record intervals in a modified record process of I.I.D variables, defined by a single parameter $c>0$. This parameter characterizes the record formation via the recursive process $R_k > R_{k-1}-c$, where $R_k$ denotes the value of the $k$-th record. We show that for $c>0$, if $f(x)$ decays slower than an exponential for large $x$, the record process is nonstationary as in the standard $c=0$ case. In contrast, if $f(x)$ has a faster than exponential tail, the record process becomes stationary and the avalanche size distribution $\\pi(n)$ has a decay faster than $1/n^2$ for large $n$. The marginal case where $f(x)$ decays exponentially for large $x$ exhibits a phase transition from a non-stationary phase to a stationary phase as $c$ increases through a critical value $c_{\\rm crit}$. Focusing on $f(x)=e^{-x}$ (with $x\\ge 0$), we show that $c_{\\rm crit}=1$ and for $c<1$, the record statistics is non-stationary. However, for $c>1$, the record statistics is stationary with avalanche size distribution $\\pi(n)\\sim n^{-1-\\lambda(c)}$ for large $n$. Consequently, for $c>1$, the mean number of records up to $N$ steps grows algebraically $\\sim N^{\\lambda(c)}$ for large $N$. Remarkably, the exponent $\\lambda(c)$ depends continously on $c$ for $c>1$ and is given by the unique positive root of $c=-\\ln (1-\\lambda)/\\lambda$. We also unveil the presence of nontrivial correlations between avalanches in the stationary phase that resemble earthquake sequences.",

However, data of interest is typically assumed to live in some (often unknown) low-dimensional manifold embedded in high-dimensional ambient space. The result is a modelling mismatch since -- by construction -- the invertibility requirement implies high-dimensional support of the learned distribution. Injective flows, mapping from low- to high-dimensional space, aim to fix this discrepancy by learning distributions on manifolds, but the resulting volume-change term becomes more challenging to evaluate. Current approaches either avoid computing this term entirely using various heuristics, or assume the manifold is known beforehand and therefore are not widely applicable. Instead, we propose two methods to tractably calculate the gradient of this term with respect to the parameters of the model, relying on careful use of automatic differentiation and techniques from numerical linear algebra. Both approaches perform end-to-end nonlinear manifold learning and density estimation for data projected onto this manifold. We study the trade-offs between our proposed methods, empirically verify that we outperform approaches ignoring the volume-change term by more accurately learning manifolds and the corresponding distributions on them, and show promising results on out-of-distribution detection.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new paradigm for maintaining speaker identity in dysarthric voice conversion (DVC). The poor quality of dysarthric speech can be greatly improved by statistical VC, but as the normal speech utterances of a dysarthria patient are nearly impossible to collect, previous work failed to recover the individuality of the patient. In light of this, we suggest a novel, two-stage approach for DVC, which is highly flexible in that no normal speech of the patient is required. First, a powerful parallel sequence-to-sequence model converts the input dysarthric speech into a normal speech of a reference speaker as an intermediate product, and a nonparallel, frame-wise VC model realized with a variational autoencoder then converts the speaker identity of the reference speech back to that of the patient while assumed to be capable of preserving the enhanced quality. We investigate several design options. Experimental evaluation results demonstrate the potential of our approach to improving the quality of the dysarthric speech while maintaining the speaker identity.",

        "abstract": "The Ebola virus and the disease in effect tend to randomly move individuals in the population around susceptible, infected, quarantined, hospitalized, recovered, and dead sub-population. Motivated by the effectiveness in propagating the disease through the virus, a new bio-inspired and population-based optimization algorithm is proposed. This paper presents a novel metaheuristic algorithm named Ebola optimization algorithm (EOSA). To correctly achieve this, this study models the propagation mechanism of the Ebola virus disease, emphasising all consistent states of the propagation. The model was further represented using a mathematical model based on first-order differential equations. After that, the combined propagation and mathematical models were adapted for developing the new metaheuristic algorithm. To evaluate the proposed method's performance and capability compared with other optimization methods, the underlying propagation and mathematical models were first investigated to determine how they successfully simulate the EVD. Furthermore, two sets of benchmark functions consisting of forty-seven (47) classical and over thirty (30) constrained IEEE CEC-2017 benchmark functions are investigated numerically. The results indicate that the performance of the proposed algorithm is competitive with other state-of-the-art optimization methods based on scalability analysis, convergence analysis, and sensitivity analysis. Extensive simulation results indicate that the EOSA outperforms other state-of-the-art popular metaheuristic optimization algorithms such as the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (ABC) on some shifted, high dimensional and large search range problems.",

The extension of the axion-dilaton-aether electrodynamics is inspired by the Jackson's idea concerning the internal symmetry of the equations of electromagnetism. The application of the extended theory to the anisotropic homogeneous cosmological model of the Bianchi-I type is considered. The exact solutions to the model evolutionary equations are obtained for the case, when the axionic dark matter is in the state of equilibrium, which is characterized by vanishing potential of the pseudoscalar field and its first derivative. The state of the axion-photon system, which is of a new type and is indicated as a dynamic equilibrium, is studied in the framework of electrodynamics with axionic non-linearity. We show that the nonlinear axion-photon interactions can mimic the dilaton-photon coupling. We discuss the stability of the model with respect to homogeneous fluctuations of the axion field.",

Although it is apparently beneficial for the organisms to reduce both error and energy cost of the discrimination process, it remains unclear to what extent these two quantities can be minimized simultaneously. Here, with a chemical kinetic formalism, we identify a fundamental error-cost bound which tightly constrains the system's performance under any parameter variations preserving the rate discrimination between substrates. The analytic form of bound is obtained in a large class of proofreading networks and supported by numeric sampling. Furthermore, this bound is kinetically controlled, i.e. completely determined by the difference between the transition state energies of corresponding enzymatic reactions on the free energy landscape. The importance of the bound is analyzed for three biological processes. DNA replication by T7 DNA polymerase is shown to be nearly optimized, i.e. its kinetic parameters place it in the immediate proximity of the error-cost bound. The isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) of E. coli also operates close to the bound, but further optimization is prevented by the need for reaction speed. On the contrary, speed requirement forces E. coli ribosome to operate in a high-dissipation regime. Together, these findings establish a fundamental relation between error and energy cost in biological proofreading networks and provide a theoretical framework for studying error-dissipation trade-off in other systems with biological discrimination.",

This thesis focuses on Assumption Digging, a type of Theory Building similar to what Hilbert undertook in his Grundlagen with Euclidean Geometry. The Euclidean Geometry course in schools is a potentially productive for Assumption Digging since, as has been noted, many courses in Euclidean Geometry contain extraneous postulates and unclear definitions. This focus of this thesis is a teaching experiment with 7th-10th grade students in two schools in Western India, which is an Assumption Digging exercise in Euclidean Geometry. The goal of this thesis is to ascertain the various ways students engage in Assumption Digging, and the role played by the instructor in the Assumption Digging sessions. While most of the student engagement with Assumption Digging was at the level of justifying claims which the instructors questioned, there were a few instances of students questioning arguments and claims made by the instructors. The role the instructors played was crucial in two ways. Firstly, deciding what path the session took and, secondly, engaging with student arguments and skepticism.",

Over a time horizon $T$, our \\textit{batch} Thompson Sampling policy achieves the same (asymptotic) regret bound of a fully sequential one while carrying out only $O(\\log T)$ batch queries. To achieve this exponential reduction, i.e., reducing the number of interactions from $T$ to $O(\\log T)$, our batch policy dynamically determines the duration of each batch in order to balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off.

However, because the surrogate rarely predicts the true north perfectly, a regular A/B test based on surrogate metrics tends to have high false positive rate and the treatment variant deemed favorable from the test may not be the winning one. In this paper, we discuss how to adjust the A/B testing comparison to ensure experiment results are trustworthy. We also provide practical guidelines on the choice of good surrogate metrics.

However, the underlying entities may have little interest in sharing their private data, proprietary models, and objective functions. These privacy requirements have created new challenges for collaboration. In this work, we propose Gradient Assisted Learning (GAL), a new method for various entities to assist each other in supervised learning tasks without sharing data, models, and objective functions. In this framework, all participants collaboratively optimize the aggregate of local loss functions, and each participant autonomously builds its own model by iteratively fitting the gradients of the objective function. Experimental studies demonstrate that Gradient Assisted Learning can achieve performance close to centralized learning when all data, models, and objective functions are fully disclosed.",

In this context, we consider an evaporating solvent into which two other components are dissolved, as a model for a 2-component coating solution that is drying on a substrate. We propose a 3-spins dynamics to describe the evolution of the three interacting species. As main tool, we use a Monte Carlo Metropolis-based algorithm, with the possibility of varying the system's temperature, mixture composition, interaction strengths, and evaporation kinetics. The main novelty is the structure of the mesoscopic model -- a bi-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions and divided in square cells to encode a mesoscopic range interaction among the units. We investigate the effect of the model parameters on the structure of the resulting morphologies. Finally, we compare the results obtained with the mesoscopic model with corresponding ones based on an analogous lattice model with a short range interaction among the units, i.e. when the mesoscopic length scale coincides with the microscopic length scale of the lattice.",

State of the art approaches are more efficient but typically rely on specific coordinate pruning schemes. In this work, we show how a surprisingly simple reparametrization of IRLS, coupled with a bilevel resolution (instead of an alternating scheme) is able to achieve top performances on a wide range of sparsity (such as Lasso, group Lasso and trace norm regularizations), regularization strength (including hard constraints), and design matrices (ranging from correlated designs to differential operators). Similarly to IRLS, our method only involves linear systems resolutions, but in sharp contrast, corresponds to the minimization of a smooth function. Despite being non-convex, we show that there is no spurious minima and that saddle points are \"ridable\", so that there always exists a descent direction. We thus advocate for the use of a BFGS quasi-Newton solver, which makes our approach simple, robust and efficient. We perform a numerical benchmark of the convergence speed of our algorithm against state of the art solvers for Lasso, group Lasso, trace norm and linearly constrained problems. These results highlight the versatility of our approach, removing the need to use different solvers depending on the specificity of the ML problem under study.",

Asymptotic pointwise confidence intervals and data-driven simultaneous confidence corridors for the coefficient functions are constructed.

Most existing works on Federated Learning (FL) assume the clients have ground-truth labels. However, in many practical scenarios, clients may be unable to label task-specific data, e.g., due to lack of expertise. In this work, we consider a server that hosts a labeled dataset, and wishes to leverage clients with unlabeled data for supervised learning. We propose a new Federated Learning framework referred to as SemiFL in order to address the problem of Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (SSFL). In SemiFL, clients have completely unlabeled data, while the server has a small amount of labeled data. SemiFL is communication efficient since it separates the training of server-side supervised data and client-side unsupervised data. We demonstrate various efficient strategies of SemiFL that enhance learning performance. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that our communication efficient method can significantly improve the performance of a labeled server with unlabeled clients. Moreover, we demonstrate that SemiFL can outperform many existing FL results trained with fully supervised data, and perform competitively with the state-of-the-art centralized Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods. For instance, in standard communication efficient scenarios, our method can perform 93% accuracy on the CIFAR10 dataset with only 4000 labeled samples at the server. Such accuracy is only 2% away from the result trained from 50000 fully labeled data, and it improves about 30% upon existing SSFL methods in the communication efficient setting.",

The Helmholtz equation provides wavefield solutions that are dimensionally reduced, per frequency, compared to the time domain, which is useful for many applications, like full waveform inversion (FWI). However, our ability to attain such wavefield solutions depends often on the size of the model and the complexity of the wave equation. Thus, we use here a recently introduced framework based on neural networks to predict functional solutions through setting the underlying physical equation as a loss function to optimize the neural network parameters. For an input given by a location in the model space, the network learns to predict the wavefield value at that location, and its partial derivatives using a concept referred to as automatic differentiation, to fit, in our case, a form of the Helmholtz equation. We specifically seek the solution of the scattered wavefield considering a simple homogeneous background model that allows for analytical solutions of the background wavefield. Providing the neural network (NN) a reasonable number of random points from the model space will ultimately train a fully connected deep NN to predict the scattered wavefield function. The size of the network depends mainly on the complexity of the desired wavefield, with such complexity increasing with increasing frequency and increasing model complexity. However, smaller networks can provide smoother wavefields that might be useful for inversion applications. Preliminary tests on a two-box-shaped scatterer model with a source in the middle, as well as, the Marmousi model with a source on the surface demonstrate the potential of the NN for this application. Additional tests on a 3D model demonstrate the potential versatility of the approach.",

        "abstract": "Real-time detection of COVID-19 using radiological images has gained priority due to the increasing demand for fast diagnosis of COVID-19 cases. This paper introduces a novel two-phase approach for classifying chest X-ray images. Deep Learning (DL) methods fail to cover these aspects since training and fine-tuning the model's parameters consume much time. In this approach, the first phase comes to train a deep CNN working as a feature extractor, and the second phase comes to use Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) for real-time detection. The main drawback of ELMs is to meet the need of a large number of hidden-layer nodes to gain a reliable and accurate detector in applying image processing since the detective performance remarkably depends on the setting of initial weights and biases. Therefore, this paper uses Chimp Optimization Algorithm (ChOA) to improve results and increase the reliability of the network while maintaining real-time capability. The designed detector is to be benchmarked on the COVID-Xray-5k and COVIDetectioNet datasets, and the results are verified by comparing it with the classic DCNN, Genetic Algorithm optimized ELM (GA-ELM), Cuckoo Search optimized ELM (CS-ELM), and Whale Optimization Algorithm optimized ELM (WOA-ELM). The proposed approach outperforms other comparative benchmarks with 98.25% and 99.11% as ultimate accuracy on the COVID-Xray-5k and COVIDetectioNet datasets, respectively, and it led relative error to reduce as the amount of 1.75% and 1.01% as compared to a convolutional CNN. More importantly, the time needed for training deep ChOA-ELM is only 0.9474 milliseconds, and the overall testing time for 3100 images is 2.937 seconds.",

        "abstract": "The black holes that have been detected via gravitational waves (GW) can have either astrophysical or primordial origin. Some GW events show significant spin for one of the components and have been assumed to be astrophysical, since primordial black holes are generated with very low spins. However, it is worth studying if they can increase their spin throughout the evolution of the universe. Possible mechanisms that have already been explored are multiple black hole mergers and gas accretion. We propose here a new mechanism that can occur in dense clusters of black holes: the spin-up of primordial black holes when they are involved in close hyperbolic encounters. We explore this effect numerically with the Einstein Toolkit for different initial conditions, including variable mass ratios. For equal masses, there is a maximum spin that can be induced on the black holes, $\\chi = a/m \\leq 0.2$. We find however that for large mass ratios one can attain spins up to $\\chi \\simeq 0.8$, where the highest spin is induced on the most massive black hole. For small induced spins we provide simple analytical expressions that depend on the relative velocity and impact parameter.",

        "abstract": "The Smart Grid System (SGS) is a joint network comprising the power and the communication network. In this paper, the underlying intra-and-interdependencies between entities for a given SGS is captured using a dependency model called Modified Implicative Interdependency Model (MIIM) [1]. Given an integer K, the K-contingency list problem gives the list of K-most critical entities, failure of which maximizes the network damage at the current time. The problem being NP complete [2] and owing to the higher running time of the given Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based solution [3], a much faster heuristic solution to generate an event driven self-updating K-contingency list [4] is also given in this paper. Based on the contingency lists obtained from both the solutions, this paper proposes an adaptive entity hardening technique based on a leader-follower game theoretic approach that arrests the cascading failure of entities in the SGS after an initial failure of entities. The validation of the work is done by comparing the contingency lists using both types of solutions, obtained for different K values using the MIIM model on a smart grid of IEEE 14-Bus system with that obtained by simulating the smart grid using a co-simulation system formed by MATPOWER and Java Network Simulator (JNS). The K-contingency list obtained for a smart grid of IEEE 14-Bus system also indicate that the network damage predicted by both the ILP based solution and heuristic solution using MIIM are more realistic compared to that obtained using another dependency model called Implicative Interdependency Model (IIM) [2]. Advantage of using the MIIM based heuristic solution is also shown in this paper when larger SGS of IEEE 118-Bus is considered. Finally, it is shown how the adaptive hardening helps in improving the network performance.",

The challenge aims at estimating a HDR image from one or multiple respective low-dynamic range (LDR) observations, which might suffer from under- or over-exposed regions and different sources of noise. The challenge is composed by two tracks: In Track 1 only a single LDR image is provided as input, whereas in Track 2 three differently-exposed LDR images with inter-frame motion are available. In both tracks, the ultimate goal is to achieve the best objective HDR reconstruction in terms of PSNR with respect to a ground-truth image, evaluated both directly and with a canonical tonemapping operation.",

This paper presents Memory Wrap, a plug-and-play extension to any image classification model. Memory Wrap improves both data-efficiency and model interpretability, adopting a content-attention mechanism between the input and some memories of past training samples. We show that Memory Wrap outperforms standard classifiers when it learns from a limited set of data, and it reaches comparable performance when it learns from the full dataset. We discuss how its structure and content-attention mechanisms make predictions interpretable, compared to standard classifiers. To this end, we both show a method to build explanations by examples and counterfactuals, based on the memory content, and how to exploit them to get insights about its decision process. We test our approach on image classification tasks using several architectures on three different datasets, namely CIFAR10, SVHN, and CINIC10.",

In this paper, we present a performance and energy aware approach that combines AI planning heuristics for parameter space exploration with a machine learning model for performance and energy evaluation to determine a near-optimal system configuration. For data-parallel applications our approach determines a near-optimal host-device distribution of work, number of processing units required and the corresponding scheduling strategy. We evaluate our approach for various heterogeneous systems accelerated with GPU or the Intel Xeon Phi. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach finds a near-optimal system configuration by evaluating only about 7% of reasonable configurations. Furthermore, the performance per Joule estimation of system configurations using our machine learning model is more than 1000x faster compared to the system evaluation by program execution.",

The majority of proposed models rely on specialized training to improve human-correlation, resulting in limited adoption, generalizability, and explainabilty.

Typicality serves as our framework to develop a novel semantic comparison, SPARCS, as well as referenceless fluency evaluation metrics. Over the course of our analysis, two separate dimensions of fluency naturally emerge: style, captured by metric SPURTS, and grammar, captured in the form of grammatical outlier penalties. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies on benchmark datasets, we show how these decomposed dimensions of semantics and fluency provide greater system-level insight into captioner differences. Our proposed metrics along with their combination, SMURF, achieve state-of-the-art correlation with human judgment when compared with other rule-based evaluation metrics.",

Recently, quantum advantage was claimed for a Gaussian boson sampling setup in which $N=50$ squeezed states of light pass through a linear optical network. The emulation of many-body statistics of identical photons in this system is seen as a computationally hard problem: the number of elementary operations grows exponentially with $N$. Thus, reproducing the experimentally observed counting statistics of the output detectors is believed to be far beyond capabilities of any classical computer. Here we challenge this statement by introducing a series of approximations for the probability of any specific measurement outcome, obeying a polynomial complexity. Our fourth order approximation gives an accuracy comparable with that of the experimental set-up and can be calculated using a laptop computer.",

Using social network analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning, in this study, we comprehensively analyzed gender-specific patterns in the highly interdisciplinary and evolving field of artificial intelligence for the period of 2000-2019. Our findings suggest an overall increasing rate of mixed-gender collaborations. From the observed gender-specific collaborative patterns, the existence of disciplinary homophily at both dyadic and team levels is confirmed. However, a higher preference was observed for female researchers to form homophilous collaborative links. Our core-periphery analysis indicated a significant positive association between having diverse collaboration and scientific performance and experience. We found evidence in support of expecting the rise of new female superstar researchers in the artificial intelligence field.",

This region admits of a pseudoscalar physical state, which is well below the observed 125-GeV scalar in mass. A second neutral scalar particle can be both above and below 125 GeV in such a scenario. Admissible regions in the parameter space are obtained by using the most recent data on muon $(g-2)$, theoretical constraints such as low-scale perturbativity and vacuum stability, and also all experimental constraints, including the available LHC results. Among other things, both the aforesaid orders of CP-even neutral scalar masses are included in our benchmark studies. Two-loop renormalisation group equations are used to predict the values of various couplings at high scales, and the regions in the space spanned by low-scale parameters, which retain perturbative unitarity as well as vacuum stability upto various scales are identified. We thus conclude that such a scenario, while successfully explaining the observed muon $(g-2)$, can be valid upto energy scales ranging from $10^{4}$ GeV to the Planck scale, thus opening up directions of thought on its ultraviolet completion.",

We present a method that reconstructs the AGN time series and simultaneously infers the posterior probability density distribution (PDF) over the physical quantities of the black hole, including its mass and luminosity. We apply this method to a simulated dataset of 11,000 AGN and report precision and accuracy of 0.4 dex and 0.3 dex in the inferred black hole mass.

When applied to a large de-identified dataset of utterances collected by a popular voice assistant platform, our method reduces perplexity by 7.0% relative over a standard LM that does not incorporate contextual information. When evaluated on utterances extracted from the long tail of the dataset, our method improves perplexity by 9.0% relative over a standard LM and by over 2.8% relative when compared to a state-of-the-art model for contextual LM.",

While word- and sentence-level attack scenarios mostly deal with finding semantic paraphrases of the input that fool NLP models, character-level attacks typically insert typos into the input stream. It is commonly thought that these are easier to defend via spelling correction modules. In this work, we show that both a standard spellchecker and the approach of Pruthi et al. (2019), which trains to defend against insertions, deletions and swaps, perform poorly on the character-level benchmark recently proposed in Eger and Benz (2020) which includes more challenging attacks such as visual and phonetic perturbations and missing word segmentations. In contrast, we show that an untrained iterative approach which combines context-independent character-level information with context-dependent information from BERT's masked language modeling can perform on par with human crowd-workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) supervised via 3-shot learning.",

Monotone operator equilibrium networks (monDEQ) retain interesting performance with additional theoretical guaranties. Existing certification tools for classical deep networks cannot directly be applied to monDEQs for which much fewer tools exist. We introduce a semialgebraic representation for ReLU based monDEQs which allows to approximate the corresponding input output relation by semidefinite programming (SDP). We present several applications to network certification and obtain SDP models for the following problems : robustness certification, Lipschitz constant estimation, ellipsoidal uncertainty propagation. We use these models to certify robustness of monDEQs w.r.t. a general $L_q$ norm. Experimental results show that the proposed models outperform existing approaches for monDEQ certification. Furthermore, our investigations suggest that monDEQs are much more robust to $L_2$ perturbations than $L_{\\infty}$ perturbations.",

While microbiome strains are increasingly demanded for biomedical applications, the vast majority of species and strains are uncultivated and without reference genomes. We address this shortcoming by encapsulating complex microbiome samples directly into microfluidic droplets and amplify a target-specific genomic fragment using a custom molecular TaqMan probe. We separate those positive droplets by droplet sorting, selectively enriching single target strain cells. Finally, we present a protocol to purify the genomic DNA while specifically removing amplicons and cell debris for high-quality genome sequencing.",

In contrast to SU(2)$_{\\rm CMB}$, these Yang-Mills theories are in confining phases (zero temperature) throughout most of the Universe's history and associate with the three lepton flavours of the Standard Model of particle physics. As the Universe expands, axionic fuzzy dark matter comprises a three-component fluid which undergoes certain depercolation transitions when dark energy (a global axion condensate) is converted into dark matter. We extract the lightest axion mass $m_{a,e}= 0.675\\times 10^{-23}\\,$eV from well motivated model fits to observed rotation curves in low-surface-brightness galaxies (SPARC catalogue). Since the virial mass of an isolated lump solely depends on $M_P$ and the associated Yang-Mills scale the properties of an e-lump predict those of $\\mu$- and $\\tau$-lumps. As a result, a typical e-lump virial mass $\\sim 6.3\\times 10^{10}\\,M_\\odot$ suggests that massive compact objects in galactic centers such as Sagittarius A$^*$ in the Milky Way are (merged) $\\mu$- and $\\tau$-lumps. In addition, $\\tau$-lumps may constitute globular clusters. SU(2)$_{\\rm CMB}$ is always thermalised, and its axion condensate never has depercolated. If the axial anomaly indeed would link leptons with dark matter and the CMB with dark energy then this would demystify the dark Universe through a firmly established feature of particle physics.",

The part of this region with negative two-boson scattering length is studied solving rigorous four-particle scattering equations for transition operators in the momentum space. Moving away from the unitary limit the Efimov tetramers evolve from unstable bound states into resonances. Their energies and widths are studied as functions of the two-boson scattering length; a universal behavior is established and given in a dimensionless representation. The Efimov tetramers have finite width in the whole regime; they broaden rapidly in the resonance regime but remain narrower than the associated trimer. The resonant behavior is most clearly seen in the four-particle recombination rate.",

This paper presents a benchmark algorithm to quantify the performance of complex automotive systems exhibiting mechanical, electrical, and thermal interactions at various time-scales. Traditionally Dynamic Programming has been used for benchmarking the performance, however, it fails to deliver results for system with higher number of states and control lever due to curse of dimensionality. We propose \"PS3\", a three-step algorithm for mixed-integer nonlinear optimal control problems with application to powertrain energy management. PS3 uses pseudo-spectral collocation theory for highly accurate modeling of dynamics. Based on the validated powertrain component models, we have addressed simultaneous optimization of electrical (SOC), vehicular (eco-driving) and thermal (after-treatment and battery temperatures) dynamics along with an integer (gear and engine on/off) control and its corresponding (dwell-time) constraints. PS3 is used to solve such large-scale powertrain problems having fast and slow dynamic states, discontinuous behaviors, non-differentiable and linearly interpolated 1-D and 2-D maps, as well as combinatorial constraints. Five case study powertrain control problems are given to benchmark the accuracy and computational effort against Dynamic Programming. Our analysis shows that this algorithm does not scale computational burden as Dynamic Programming does, and can handle highly complex interactions that occur in modern-day powertrains, without compromising nonlinear and complex plant modeling.",

Namely, given cardinals $\\kappa<\\lambda$ and a class $\\mathcal{C}$ of structures of the same type, the corresponding instance of $\\mathrm{ESR}$ asserts that for every structure $A$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ of rank $\\lambda$, there is a structure $B$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ of rank $\\kappa$ and an elementary embedding of $B$ into $A$.

Indeed, when restricted to $\\Pi_1$-definable classes of structures they follow from the existence of $I1$-embeddings, while for more complicated classes of structures, e.g., $\\Sigma_2$, they are not known to be consistent.

Adapter tuning consists in freezing pretrained parameters of a model and injecting lightweight modules between layers, resulting in the addition of only a small number of task-specific trainable parameters. While adapter tuning was investigated for multilingual neural machine translation, this paper proposes a comprehensive analysis of adapters for multilingual speech translation (ST). Starting from different pre-trained models (a multilingual ST trained on parallel data or a multilingual BART (mBART) trained on non-parallel multilingual data), we show that adapters can be used to: (a) efficiently specialize ST to specific language pairs with a low extra cost in terms of parameters, and (b) transfer from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) task and an mBART pre-trained model to a multilingual ST task. Experiments show that adapter tuning offer competitive results to full fine-tuning, while being much more parameter-efficient.",

To this end, we build upon recent methods for quantifying a system's social stereotypes, augmenting them with different kinds of ethical interventions and the desired model behavior under such interventions. Our zero-shot evaluation finds that even today's powerful neural language models are extremely poor ethical-advice takers, that is, they respond surprisingly little to ethical interventions even though these interventions are stated as simple sentences. Few-shot learning improves model behavior but remains far from the desired outcome, especially when evaluated for various types of generalization.

The analysis of rough-to-rough contact mechanics for surface profiles exhibiting fractal structures, with fractal dimensions in the regime 1 2, reveals the significant effect of surface fractality on contact mechanics and compliance with surfaces having the same mean roughness but higher fractality showing lower contact stiffness in conditions of initial contact for a given load. The predicted linear development of true contact area with load was found to be consistent with diverse existing numerical and experimental studies. Results from this model demonstrate the applicability of the developed method for the meaningful contact analysis of hierarchical structures with implications for modelling tribological interactions between pairs of rough surfaces",

This chopping serves to remove the fast time variable components of (a) sky variation and (b) array background. However, there is a significant price to pay for this, including reduced on-object photon collection time, stringent demands on the secondary mirror, nodding the telescope to remove the radiative offset imprinted by the chopping, and an often-fixed chop-frequency regardless of the sky conditions in the actual observations. Worse, in the era of 30m telescopes it is wholly impracticable to chop the secondary mirror. If the array is stable enough, drift scanning holds the promise to remove the necessity of chopping. In this paper we report our experiments using the CanariCam MIR instrument on the 10.4m GranTeCan and the implications to future instruments and experiments.",

We first identify the regime in which nonthermal effects dominate over simple Joule heating, and then demonstrate that, for small enough perturbation, pulsed current injection allows access to nonthermally-induced resistive metastable states. The results are consistent with pinning of the fluctuating charge order, with fluctuations being most pronounced at the charge-order onset temperature. The nonequilibrium effects are revealed only when the transition is approached from the charge-ordered phase. Our experiment establishes pulsed current injection as a viable and effective method for probing the charge-order dynamics in various other materials.",

For $n \\le N$, the formula can be expressed in terms of a sum of symmetry factors of partitions of $n$ denoted $Z_3(n)$. We derive the large $n$ all-orders asymptotic formula for $ Z_3(n)$ making contact with high order results previously obtained numerically. The derivation relies on the dominance in the sum, of partitions with many parts of length $1$. The dominance of other small parts in restricted partition sums leads to related asymptotic results. The result for the $3$-index tensor observables gives the large $n$ asymptotic expansion for the counting of bipartite ribbon graphs with $n$ edges, and for the dimension of the associated Kronecker permutation centralizer algebra. We explain how the different terms in the asymptotics are associated with probability distributions over ribbon graphs. The large $n$ dominance of small parts also leads to conjectured formulae for the asymptotics of invariants for general $d$-index tensors. The coefficients of $ 1/n$ in these expansions involve Stirling numbers of the second kind along with restricted partition sums.",

The available number of binding interactions is dependent on the number of feet (multivalency), and on their allowed distance from the central hub (span). Using Monte Carlo simulations that implement the Gillespie algorithm, we simulate multivalent diffusive transport processes for 100 distinct walker designs. Informed by our simulation results we derive an analytical expression for the diffusion coefficient of a general multivalent diffusive process as a function of multivalency, span, and dissociation constant Kd. Our findings can be used to guide experimental design of multivalent transporters, in particular providing insight into how to overcome trade-offs between diffusivity and processivity.",

We study the interplay of multiscale surface structures with molecular-scale interactions towards interpreting static frictional interactions at fractal interfaces. By spline-assisted-discretization we analyse asperity interactions in pairs of contacting fractal surface-profiles. For elastically deforming asperities, force analysis reveals greater friction at surfaces exhibiting higher fractality, with increasing molecular-scale friction amplifying this trend. Increasing adhesive strength yields higher overall friction at surfaces of lower fractality owing to greater true-contact-area. In systems where adhesive-type interactions play an important role, such as those where cold-welded junctions form, friction is minimised at an intermediate value of surface profile fractality found to be around 1.3 to 1.5. Results have implications for systems exhibiting evolving surface structures.",

Our proposed test instead allows the associations among the random variables to be nonlinear and the data to be time-dependent. We build the test based on some highly flexible neural networks learners. We establish the asymptotic guarantees of the test, while allowing either the number of subjects or the number of time points for each subject to diverge to infinity.

In contrast, at room temperature, the radial distribution of a single \\ce{Na+} ion in the droplet core is nearly uniform. We analyze the spatial distribution of a single ion in terms of a reference electrostatic model. The energy of the system in the analytical model is expressed as the sum of the electrostatic and surface energy of a deformable droplet. The model predicts that the ion is subject to a harmonic potential centered at the droplet's center of mass. We name this effect \"electrostatic confinement\". The model's predictions are consistent with the simulation findings for a single Na+ ion at room temperature but not at supercooling. We anticipate this study to be the starting point for investigating the structure of supercooled electrosprayed droplets that are used to preserve the conformations of macromolecules originating from the bulk solution.",

Here, we explore trends in words and phrases related to mental health through a collection of 1- , 2-, and 3-grams parsed from a data stream of roughly 10% of all English tweets since 2012. We examine temporal dynamics of mental health language, finding that the popularity of the phrase 'mental health' increased by nearly two orders of magnitude between 2012 and 2018. We observe that mentions of 'mental health' spike annually and reliably due to mental health awareness campaigns, as well as unpredictably in response to mass shootings, celebrities dying by suicide, and popular fictional stories portraying suicide. We find that the level of positivity of messages containing 'mental health', while stable through the growth period, has declined recently. Finally, we use the ratio of original tweets to retweets to quantify the fraction of appearances of mental health language due to social amplification. Since 2015, mentions of mental health have become increasingly due to retweets, suggesting that stigma associated with discussion of mental health on Twitter has diminished with time.",

The three key design principle of Dagger are: (1) offloading the entire RPC stack to an FPGA-based NIC, (2) leveraging memory interconnects instead of PCIe buses as the interface with the host CPU, and (3) making the acceleration fabric reconfigurable, so it can accommodate the diverse needs of microservices. We show that the combination of these principles significantly improves the efficiency and performance of cloud RPC systems while preserving their generality. Dagger achieves 1.3-3.8x higher per-core RPC throughput compared to both highly-optimized software stacks, and systems using specialized RDMA adapters. It also scales up to 84 Mrps with 8 threads on 4 CPU cores, while maintaining state-of-the-art us-scale tail latency. We also demonstrate that large third-party applications, like memcached and MICA KVS, can be easily ported on Dagger with minimal changes to their codebase, bringing their median and tail KVS access latency down to 2.8 - 3.5us and 5.4 - 7.8us, respectively. Finally, we show that Dagger is beneficial for multi-tier end-to-end microservices with different threading models by evaluating it using an 8-tier application implementing a flight check-in service.",

Nevertheless, the excellent prediction performance of these black-box models rely heavily on the availability of strong supervision, i.e. a large set of accurate and exact ground-truth labels. In practice, strong supervision can be unavailable or expensive, which calls for modeling techniques under weak supervision. In this comment, we summarize the key concepts in weakly supervised learning and discuss some recent developments in the field. Using algorithmic modeling alone under a weak supervision might lead to unstable and misleading results. A promising direction would be integrating the data modeling culture into such a framework.",

Though such optimization problems arise in many machine learning paradigms including training generative adversarial networks (GANs) and adversarially robust models, many fundamental issues remain in theory, such as the absence of efficiently computable optimality notions, and cyclic or diverging behavior of existing algorithms. Our framework sprouts from the practical consideration that under a computational budget, the max-player can not fully maximize $f(x,\\cdot)$ since nonconcave maximization is NP-hard in general. So, we propose a new algorithm for the min-player to play against smooth algorithms deployed by the adversary (i.e., the max-player) instead of against full maximization. Our algorithm is guaranteed to make monotonic progress (thus having no limit cycles), and to find an appropriate \"stationary point\" in a polynomial number of iterations. Our framework covers practical settings where the smooth algorithms deployed by the adversary are multi-step stochastic gradient ascent, and its accelerated version. We further provide complementing experiments that confirm our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in practice.",

        "abstract": "User engagement is crucial to the long-term success of a mobile app. Several metrics, such as dwell time, have been used for measuring user engagement. However, how to effectively predict user engagement in the context of mobile apps is still an open research question. For example, do the mobile usage contexts (e.g.,~time of day) in which users access mobile apps impact their dwell time? Answers to such questions could help mobile operating system and publishers to optimize advertising and service placement. In this paper, we first conduct an empirical study for assessing how user characteristics, temporal features, and the short/long-term contexts contribute to gains in predicting users' app dwell time on the population level. The comprehensive analysis is conducted on large app usage logs collected through a mobile advertising company. The dataset covers more than 12K anonymous users and 1.3 million log events. Based on the analysis, we further investigate a novel mobile app engagement prediction problem -- can we predict simultaneously what app the user will use next and how long he/she will stay on that app? We propose several strategies for this joint prediction problem and demonstrate that our model can improve the performance significantly when compared with the state-of-the-art baselines. Our work can help mobile system developers in designing a better and more engagement-aware mobile app user experience.",

We investigate whether MedNLI, a physician-annotated dataset with premises extracted from clinical notes, contains such artifacts (Romanov and Shivade, 2018). We find that entailed hypotheses contain generic versions of specific concepts in the premise, as well as modifiers related to responsiveness, duration, and probability. Neutral hypotheses feature conditions and behaviors that co-occur with, or cause, the condition(s) in the premise. Contradiction hypotheses feature explicit negation of the premise and implicit negation via assertion of good health. Adversarial filtering demonstrates that performance degrades when evaluated on the difficult subset. We provide partition information and recommendations for alternative dataset construction strategies for knowledge-intensive domains.",

As a result, Nudge outperforms FCFS for every moment and every percentile of response time. Moreover, Nudge provides a multiplicative improvement over FCFS in the asymptotic tail. This resolves a long-standing open problem by showing that, counter to previous conjecture, FCFS is not strongly asymptotically optimal.",

The presence of the cross magnetic field (B=100G) and the addition of pressure increase the degree of chaos. Lower scale vector fields show that phonon sinks and traps and cool the plasma electron temperatures. The average electron and ion density profiles are provided by the 2D particle in cell simulation.

Furthermore, we present the first calibration study in the open retrieval setting, comparing the calibration accuracy of retrieval-based span prediction models and answer generation models.

Time-dependent gate breakdown measurements reveal that the maximum gate drive voltage increases from 6.2 to 10.6 V for a 10-year lifetime with a 1% gate failure rate.

In this paper we present an effective framework to compute many ergodic properties of these systems, in particular invariant measures and mean return times. The framework combines three ingredients that each harness the smooth structure of these systems' induced maps: Abel functions to compute the action of the induced maps, Euler-Maclaurin summation to compute the pointwise action of their transfer operators, and Chebyshev Galerkin discretisations to compute the spectral data of the transfer operators. The combination of these techniques allows one to obtain exponential convergence of estimates for polynomially growing computational outlay, independent of the order of the map's neutral fixed point. This enables numerical exploration of intermittent dynamics in all parameter regimes, including in the infinite ergodic regime.",

        "abstract": "Structured data, or data that adheres to a pre-defined schema, can suffer from fragmented context: information describing a single entity can be scattered across multiple datasets or tables tailored for specific business needs, with no explicit linking keys (e.g., primary key-foreign key relationships or heuristic functions). Context enrichment, or rebuilding fragmented context, using keyless joins is an implicit or explicit step in machine learning (ML) pipelines over structured data sources. This process is tedious, domain-specific, and lacks support in now-prevalent no-code ML systems that let users create ML pipelines using just input data and high-level configuration files. In response, we propose Ember, a system that abstracts and automates keyless joins to generalize context enrichment. Our key insight is that Ember can enable a general keyless join operator by constructing an index populated with task-specific embeddings. Ember learns these embeddings by leveraging Transformer-based representation learning techniques. We describe our core architectural principles and operators when developing Ember, and empirically demonstrate that Ember allows users to develop no-code pipelines for five domains, including search, recommendation and question answering, and can exceed alternatives by up to 39% recall, with as little as a single line configuration change.",

This induces a long-range intersite coupling that, at long distances, decreases as a power law. In the linear regime, we compute both, the spectrum of plane waves and the mean square displacement (MSD) of an initially localized excitation, in closed form in terms of regularized hypergeometric functions and the fractional exponent. The MSD shows ballistic behavior at long times, MSD$\\sim t^2$ for all fractional exponents. When the fractional exponent is decreased from its standard integer value, the bandwidth decreases and the density of states shows a tendency towards degeneracy. In the limit of a vanishing exponent, the system becomes completely degenerate. For the nonlinear regime, we compute numerically the low-lying nonlinear modes, as a function of the fractional exponent. A modulational stability computation shows that, as the fractional exponent decreases, the number of electrical discrete solitons generated also decreases, eventually collapsing into a single soliton.",

Explainability is a situated interaction between a user and the AI system rather than being static design principles. The content of explanations is context-dependent and must be defined by evidence about the user and its context. This paper seeks to operationalize this concept by proposing a formative architecture that defines the explanation space from a user-inspired perspective. The architecture comprises five intertwined components to outline explanation requirements for a task: (1) the end-users mental models, (2) the end-users cognitive process, (3) the user interface, (4) the human-explainer agent, and the (5) agent process. We first define each component of the architecture. Then we present the Abstracted Explanation Space, a modeling tool that aggregates the architecture's components to support designers in systematically aligning explanations with the end-users work practices, needs, and goals. It guides the specifications of what needs to be explained (content - end-users mental model), why this explanation is necessary (context - end-users cognitive process), to delimit how to explain it (format - human-explainer agent and user interface), and when should the explanations be given. We then exemplify the tool's use in an ongoing case study in the aircraft maintenance domain. Finally, we discuss possible contributions of the tool, known limitations/areas for improvement, and future work to be done.",

Through an ablation study, we show that incorporating the learned activation function from Computational Efficient Neural Image Compression (CENIC) and designing more parameter-efficient convolutional blocks yields dramatic gains in efficiency and performance. Our proposed architecture incorporates Generalized Divisive Normalization activations and propose a spatially separable InceptionV4-inspired block. We then evaluate rate-distortion curves on the standard JPEG Pleno 8i Voxelized Full Bodies dataset to evaluate our model's performance. Our proposed modifications outperform the baseline approaches by a small margin in terms of Bjontegard delta rate and PSNR values, yet reduces necessary encoder convolution operations by 8 percent and reduces total encoder parameters by 20 percent. Our proposed architecture, when considered on its own, has a small penalty of 0.02 percent in Chamfer's Distance and 0.32 percent increased bit rate in Point to Plane Distance for the same peak signal-to-noise ratio.",

Even though recent work on GANs enables synthesis of realistic hair or faces, it remains difficult to combine them into a single, coherent, and plausible image rather than a disjointed set of image patches. We present a novel solution to image blending, particularly for the problem of hairstyle transfer, based on GAN-inversion. We propose a novel latent space for image blending which is better at preserving detail and encoding spatial information, and propose a new GAN-embedding algorithm which is able to slightly modify images to conform to a common segmentation mask. Our novel representation enables the transfer of the visual properties from multiple reference images including specific details such as moles and wrinkles, and because we do image blending in a latent-space we are able to synthesize images that are coherent. Our approach avoids blending artifacts present in other approaches and finds a globally consistent image. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement over the current state of the art in a user study, with users preferring our blending solution over 95 percent of the time.",

In this article, we present a new perspective towards understanding how Transformers work. In particular, we show that the \"dot-product attention\" that is the core of the Transformer's operation can be characterized as a kernel learning method on a pair of Banach spaces. In particular, the Transformer's kernel is characterized as having an infinite feature dimension. Along the way we consider an extension of the standard kernel learning problem to a binary setting, where data come from two input domains and a response is defined for every cross-domain pair. We prove a new representer theorem for these binary kernel machines with non-Mercer (indefinite, asymmetric) kernels (implying that the functions learned are elements of reproducing kernel Banach spaces rather than Hilbert spaces), and also prove a new universal approximation theorem showing that the Transformer calculation can learn any binary non-Mercer reproducing kernel Banach space pair. We experiment with new kernels in Transformers, and obtain results that suggest the infinite dimensionality of the standard Transformer kernel is partially responsible for its performance. This paper's results provide a new theoretical understanding of a very important but poorly understood model in modern machine~learning.",

The membrane connects two rings in the classic geometry that produces a catenoidal shape in a soap film. In our problem, we find infinitely many branches of solutions for the shape and external force as functions of the separation of the rings, analogous to the infinite family of eigenmodes for the Euler buckling of a slender rod. Special attention is paid to the catenoid, which emerges as the shape of maximal allowable separation when the area is less than a critical area equal to the planar area enclosed by the two rings. A perturbation theory argument directly relates the tension of catenoidal membranes to the stability of catenoidal soap films in this regime. When the membrane area is larger than the critical area, we find additional cylindrical tether solutions to the shape equations at large ring separation, and that arbitrarily large ring separations are possible. These results apply for the case of vanishing Gaussian curvature modulus; when the Gaussian curvature modulus is nonzero and the area is below the critical area, the force and the membrane tension diverge as the ring separation approaches its maximum value. We also examine the stability of our shapes and analytically show that catenoidal membranes have markedly different stability properties than their soap film counterparts.",

To explore these signatures, ultra-large Cherenkov detectors such as IceCube exploit event samples with charged current muon neutrino interactions > 1 TeV. Most of these interactions occur below the detector volume, and produce muons that enter the detector. However, the large spacing between detectors leads to inefficiency for measuring muons with energies below or near the critical energy of 400 GeV. In response, IceCube has built a densely instrumented region within the larger detector. This provides large samples of well-reconstructed interactions that are contained within the densely instrumented region, extending up to energies of ~50 GeV. This leaves a gap of relatively unexplored atmospheric-neutrino events with energies between 50 GeV and 1 TeV in the ultra-large detectors. In this paper we point out that interesting Beyond Standard Model signatures may appear in this energy window, and that early running of the DUNE far detectors can give insight into new physics that may appear in this range.",

A sufficient condition for this to happen is that the POVM is symmetric, which is equivalent to the fact that the associated Gabor frame is an equiangular tight frame (ETF). The existence of Gabor ETF is an important special case of the Zauner conjecture. It is known that generically all Gabor FUNTFs lead to informationally complete POVMs. In this paper, we initiate a classification of non-complete Gabor POVMs. In the process we establish some seemingly simple facts about the eigenvalues of the Gram matrix of the rank one matrices generated by a finite Gabor frame.

The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a cornerstone for modeling high-dimensional systems from data. However, the quality of the linear DMD model is known to be fragile with respect to strong nonlinearity, which contaminates the model estimate. In contrast, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) learns fully nonlinear models, disambiguating the linear and nonlinear effects, but is restricted to low-dimensional systems. In this work, we present a kernel method that learns interpretable data-driven models for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems. Our method performs kernel regression on a sparse dictionary of samples that appreciably contribute to the underlying dynamics. We show that this kernel method efficiently handles high-dimensional data and is flexible enough to incorporate partial knowledge of system physics. It is possible to accurately recover the linear model contribution with this approach, disambiguating the effects of the implicitly defined nonlinear terms, resulting in a DMD-like model that is robust to strongly nonlinear dynamics. We demonstrate our approach on data from a wide range of nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations that arise in the physical sciences. This framework can be used for many practical engineering tasks such as model order reduction, diagnostics, prediction, control, and discovery of governing laws.",

        "abstract": "Although galactic winds play a critical role in regulating galaxy formation, hydrodynamic cosmological simulations do not resolve the scales that govern the interaction between winds and the ambient circumgalactic medium (CGM). We implement the Physically Evolved Wind (PhEW) model of Huang et al. (2020) in the GIZMO hydrodynamics code and perform test cosmological simulations with different choices of model parameters and numerical resolution. PhEW adopts an explicit subgrid model that treats each wind particle as a collection of clouds that exchange mass, metals, and momentum with their surroundings and evaporate by conduction and hydrodynamic instabilities as calibrated on much higher resolution cloud scale simulations. In contrast to a conventional wind algorithm, we find that PhEW results are robust to numerical resolution and implementation details because the small scale interactions are defined by the model itself. Compared to conventional wind simulations with the same resolution, our PhEW simulations produce similar galaxy stellar mass functions at $z\\geq 1$ but are in better agreement with low-redshift observations at $M_* < 10^{11}M_\\odot$ because PhEW particles shed mass to the CGM before escaping low mass halos. PhEW radically alters the CGM metal distribution because PhEW particles disperse metals to the ambient medium as their clouds dissipate, producing a CGM metallicity distribution that is skewed but unimodal and is similar between cold and hot gas. While the temperature distributions and radial profiles of gaseous halos are similar in simulations with PhEW and conventional winds, these changes in metal distribution will affect their predicted UV/X-ray properties in absorption and emission.",

Controlling the fluid flow, species transport, and reactive environment is critical to attaining high performance. However, conventional electrode materials like felts and papers provide few opportunities for precise engineering of the electrode and its microstructure. To address these limitations, architected electrodes composed of unit cells with spatially varying geometry determined via computational optimization are proposed. Resolved simulation is employed to develop a homogenized description of the constituent unit cells. These effective properties serve as inputs to a continuum model for the electrode when used in the negative half cell of a vanadium redox flow battery. Porosity distributions minimizing power loss are then determined via computational design optimization to generate architected porosity electrodes. The architected electrodes are compared to bulk, uniform porosity electrodes and found to lead to increased power efficiency across operating flow rates and currents. The design methodology is further used to generate a scaled-up electrode with comparable power efficiency to the bench-scale systems. The variable porosity architecture and computational design methodology presented here thus offers a novel pathway for automatically generating spatially engineered electrode structures with improved power performance.",

First, a necessary and sufficient rank criterion for the equality of two conditional Gaussian distributions is proved. Assuming a partial finite-order Markov property, conditions are then derived under which Granger causality between them can be reliably inferred from the second order moments of the quantized processes. A necessary and sufficient condition is proposed for Granger causality inference under binary quantization. Furthermore, sufficient conditions are introduced to infer Granger causality between jointly Gaussian signals through measurements quantized via non-uniform, uniform or high resolution quantizers. This approach does not require the statistics of the underlying Gaussian signals to be estimated, or a system model to be identified. No assumptions are made on the identifiability of the jointly Gaussian random processes through the quantized observations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by simulation results.",

In general, because of wave-particle duality, Alice and Bob cannot always win the overall game. However, if the required amount of path and phase information is not too great, for example specifying a set of paths or phases, one of which is the right one, then they can always win.

While Question Answering over KG (KGQA) has received some attention from the research community, QA over Temporal KGs (Temporal KGQA) is a relatively unexplored area. Lack of broad coverage datasets has been another factor limiting progress in this area. We address this challenge by presenting CRONQUESTIONS, the largest known Temporal KGQA dataset, clearly stratified into buckets of structural complexity. CRONQUESTIONS expands the only known previous dataset by a factor of 340x. We find that various state-of-the-art KGQA methods fall far short of the desired performance on this new dataset. In response, we also propose CRONKGQA, a transformer-based solution that exploits recent advances in Temporal KG embeddings, and achieves performance superior to all baselines, with an increase of 120% in accuracy over the next best performing method. Through extensive experiments, we give detailed insights into the workings of CRONKGQA, as well as situations where significant further improvements appear possible. In addition to the dataset, we have released our code as well.",

We propose a two-step method to interpret summarization model decisions. We first analyze the model's behavior by ablating the full model to categorize each decoder decision into one of several generation modes: roughly, is the model behaving like a language model, is it relying heavily on the input, or is it somewhere in between? After isolating decisions that do depend on the input, we explore interpreting these decisions using several different attribution methods. We compare these techniques based on their ability to select content and reconstruct the model's predicted token from perturbations of the input, thus revealing whether highlighted attributions are truly important for the generation of the next token. While this machinery can be broadly useful even beyond summarization, we specifically demonstrate its capability to identify phrases the summarization model has memorized and determine where in the training pipeline this memorization happened, as well as study complex generation phenomena like sentence fusion on a per-instance basis.",

We investigate the spatial behaviour of the FLITECAM 3.3 um filter as a proxy for the 3.3 um PAH band, the integrated 11.2 um PAH band, and the IRAC 8.0 um filter as a proxy for the sum of the 7.7 and 8.6 um PAH bands. The resulting ratios of 11.2/3.3 and IRAC 8.0/11.2 provide an approximate measure of the average PAH size and PAH ionization respectively. In both RNe, we find that the relative PAH ionization and the average PAH size increases with decreasing distance to the illuminating source. The average PAH sizes derived for NGC 2023 are greater than those found for NGC 7023 at all points. Both results indicate that PAH size is dependent on the radiation field intensity. These results provide additional evidence of a rich carbon-based chemistry driven by the photo-chemical evolution of the omnipresent PAH molecules within the interstellar medium. In contrast, we did not detect a significant variation in the average PAH size found in the region southeast of the Orion Bar and report a peculiar PAH ionization radial profile.",

The classical definition of collapsibility involves certain conditions on a pair of cubes of the complex. The direction of the space can be taken into account by requiring that the past links of vertices remain homotopy equivalent after collapsing. We call this type of collapse a link-preserving directed collapse. In this paper, we give combinatorially equivalent conditions for preserving the topology of the links, allowing for the implementation of an algorithm for collapsing a directed Euclidean cubical complex. Furthermore, we give conditions for when link-preserving directed collapses preserve the contractability and connectedness of directed path spaces, as well as examples when link-preserving directed collapses do not preserve the number of connected components of the path space between the minimum and a given vertex.",

Hence understanding the emotions of each partner is important. Yet current approaches that are used include self-reports which are burdensome and hence limit the frequency of this data collection. Automatic emotion prediction could address this challenge. Insights from psychology research indicate that partners' behaviors influence each other's emotions in conflict interaction and hence, the behavior of both partners could be considered to better predict each partner's emotion. However, it is yet to be investigated how doing so compares to only using each partner's own behavior in terms of emotion prediction performance. In this work, we used BERT to extract linguistic features (i.e., what partners said) and openSMILE to extract paralinguistic features (i.e., how they said it) from a data set of 368 German-speaking Swiss couples (N = 736 individuals) which were videotaped during an 8-minutes conflict interaction in the laboratory. Based on those features, we trained machine learning models to predict if partners feel positive or negative after the conflict interaction. Our results show that including the behavior of the other partner improves the prediction performance. Furthermore, for men, considering how their female partners spoke is most important and for women considering what their male partner said is most important in getting better prediction performance. This work is a step towards automatically recognizing each partners' emotion based on the behavior of both, which would enable a better understanding of couples in research, therapy, and the real world.",

Recently, multiple methods have been proposed that use deep learning to generate knockoffs for controlled feature selection through the Model-X knockoff framework. We demonstrate, however, that these methods often fail to control the false discovery rate (FDR). There are two reasons for this shortcoming. First, these methods often learn inaccurate models of features. Second, the \"swap\" property, which is required for knockoffs to be valid, is often not well enforced. We propose a new procedure called FlowSelect that remedies both of these problems. To more accurately model the features, FlowSelect uses normalizing flows, the state-of-the-art method for density estimation. To circumvent the need to enforce the swap property, FlowSelect uses a novel MCMC-based procedure to directly compute p-values for each feature. Asymptotically, FlowSelect controls the FDR exactly. Empirically, FlowSelect controls the FDR well on both synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks, whereas competing knockoff-based approaches fail to do so. FlowSelect also demonstrates greater power on these benchmarks. Additionally, using data from a genome-wide association study of soybeans, FlowSelect correctly infers the genetic variants associated with specific soybean traits.",

Notwithstanding the aforesaid, it is often implicitly assumed that quantum gravity effects must remain confined to black hole interiors. In this essay we argue in the opposite direction, discussing theoretical evidence for the existence of strong correlations between the physics inside and outside non-singular black holes. We conclude that astronomical tests of the surroundings of black holes can provide invaluable information about their so-far unexplored interiors.",

        "abstract": "The discovery of amino acids in meteorites has presented two clues to the origin of their processing subsequent to their formation: a slight preference for left-handedness in some of them, and isotopic anomalies in some of their constituent atoms. In this article we present theoretical results from the Supernova Neutrino Amino Acid Processing (SNAAP) model, which uses electron anti-neutrinos and the magnetic fields from source objects such as supernovae or colliding neutron stars to selectively destroy one amino acid chirality and to create isotopic abundance shifts. For plausible magnetic fields and electron anti-neutrino fluxes, non-zero, positive enantiomeric excesses, $ee$s, defined to be the relative left/right asymmetry in an amino acid population, are reviewed for two amino acids, and conditions are suggested that would produce $ee>0$ for all of the $\\alpha$-amino acids. The relatively high energy anti-neutrinos that produce the $ee$s would inevitably also produce isotopic anomalies. A nuclear reaction network was developed to describe the reactions resulting from them and the nuclides in the meteorites. At similar anti-neutrino fluxes, assumed recombination of the detritus from the anti-neutrino interactions is shown to produce appreciable isotopic anomalies in qualitative agreement with those observed for D/$^1$H and $^{15}$N/$^{14}$N. The isotopic anomalies for $^{13}$C/$^{12}$C are predicted to be small, as are also observed. Autocatalysis may be necessary for any model to produce the largest $ee$s observed in meteorites. This allows the constraints of the original SNAAP model to be relaxed, increasing the probability of meteoroid survival in sites where amino acid processing is possible. These results have obvious implications for the origin of life on Earth.",

        "abstract": "Deep image inpainting aims to restore damaged or missing regions in an image with realistic contents. While having a wide range of applications such as object removal and image recovery, deep inpainting techniques also have the risk of being manipulated for image forgery. A promising countermeasure against such forgeries is deep inpainting detection, which aims to locate the inpainted regions in an image. In this paper, we make the first attempt towards universal detection of deep inpainting, where the detection network can generalize well when detecting different deep inpainting methods. To this end, we first propose a novel data generation approach to generate a universal training dataset, which imitates the noise discrepancies exist in real versus inpainted image contents to train universal detectors. We then design a Noise-Image Cross-fusion Network (NIX-Net) to effectively exploit the discriminative information contained in both the images and their noise patterns. We empirically show, on multiple benchmark datasets, that our approach outperforms existing detection methods by a large margin and generalize well to unseen deep inpainting techniques. Our universal training dataset can also significantly boost the generalizability of existing detection methods.",

They calculate that ~20% of long-period comets impacting Earth will have first been disrupted by passage inside the Sun's Roche limit, generating thousands of fragments, each the needed size of the Chicxulub impactor. This would increase the impact rate of comets by a factor ~15, making them as likely to hit the Earth as an asteroid. They also argue that a comet would be a factor of 10 more likely to match the geochemical constraints, which indicate the Chicxulub impactor was carbonaceous chondrite-like. These conclusions are based on misinterpretations of the literature. Siraj & Loeb [1] overestimate the number of fragments produced during tidal disruption of a comet: tens of fragments are produced, not thousands. They also conflate 'carbonaceous chondrite' with specific types of carbonaceous chondrite, and ignore the evidence of iridium, making comets seem more likely than asteroids to match the Chicxulub impactor, when in fact they likely can be ruled out. Rather than a comet, an asteroidal impactor similar to CM or CR carbonaceous chondrites is strongly favored.",

We report on a continuum system featuring locally bistable units that allows for the controlled and self-sustained manifestation of macroscopic geometric frustration. The patterning of the units encodes a finite set of ordered ground configurations (spin-ice states) and a unique family of co-existing higher-order frustrated states (spin-liquid states), which are both activated upon unit inversion. We present a strategy for accessing any globally frustrated state on-demand by controlling the constitutive units' inversion sequence. This control strategy allows for observing the unfolding of geometric frustration as the microstructural features evolve due to the energy minimization of the constitutive units' interactions. More broadly, our model system offers a blueprint for \"taming\" macroscopic geometric frustration, enabling novel applications such as path-driven computation and solving optimisation problems using structural systems.",

Nevertheless, many basic questions about interactions are difficult to investigate because dyadic processes can be within a person and between partners, they are based on multimodal aspects of behavior and unfold rapidly. Current analyses are mainly based on the behavioral coding method, whereby human coders annotate behavior based on a coding schema. But coding is labor-intensive, expensive, slow, focuses on few modalities. Current approaches in psychology use LIWC for analyzing couples' interactions. However, advances in natural language processing such as BERT could enable the development of systems to potentially automate behavioral coding, which in turn could substantially improve psychological research. In this work, we train machine learning models to automatically predict positive and negative communication behavioral codes of 368 German-speaking Swiss couples during an 8-minute conflict interaction on a fine-grained scale (10-seconds sequences) using linguistic features and paralinguistic features derived with openSMILE. Our results show that both simpler TF-IDF features as well as more complex BERT features performed better than LIWC, and that adding paralinguistic features did not improve the performance. These results suggest it might be time to consider modern alternatives to LIWC, the de facto linguistic features in psychology, for prediction tasks in couples research. This work is a further step towards the automated coding of couples' behavior which could enhance couple research and therapy, and be utilized for other dyadic interactions as well.",

We generalize this result to all finite fields by analyzing certain finite quotients of $\\Bbb F_q[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ which come from the Stanley-Reisner rings of some matroid complexes. Our method also shows that the space of indecomposable elements in degree $q^{n-1}-n$ has the dimension equal to that of a complex cuspidal representation of $GL_n(\\Bbb F_q)$. As a by product, over the prime field $\\Bbb F_2$, we give a decomposition of the Steinberg summand of one of these quotients into a direct sum of suspensions of Brown-Gitler modules.

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art deep neural networks are sensitive to small input perturbations. Since the discovery of this intriguing vulnerability, many defence methods have been proposed that attempt to improve robustness to adversarial noise. Fast and accurate attacks are required to compare various defence methods. However, evaluating adversarial robustness has proven to be extremely challenging. Existing norm minimisation adversarial attacks require thousands of iterations (e.g. Carlini & Wagner attack), are limited to the specific norms (e.g. Fast Adaptive Boundary), or produce sub-optimal results (e.g. Brendel & Bethge attack). On the other hand, PGD attack, which is fast, general and accurate, ignores the norm minimisation penalty and solves a simpler perturbation-constrained problem. In this work, we introduce a fast, general and accurate adversarial attack that optimises the original non-convex constrained minimisation problem. We interpret optimising the Lagrangian of the adversarial attack optimisation problem as a two-player game: the first player minimises the Lagrangian wrt the adversarial noise; the second player maximises the Lagrangian wrt the regularisation penalty. Our attack algorithm simultaneously optimises primal and dual variables to find the minimal adversarial perturbation. In addition, for non-smooth $l_p$-norm minimisation, such as $l_{\\infty}$-, $l_1$-, and $l_0$-norms, we introduce primal-dual proximal gradient descent attack. We show in the experiments that our attack outperforms current state-of-the-art $l_{\\infty}$-, $l_2$-, $l_1$-, and $l_0$-attacks on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Restricted ImageNet datasets against unregularised and adversarially trained models.",

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety",

However, these existing methods on MPC usually represent interlocutors and utterances individually and ignore the inherent complicated structure in MPC which may provide crucial interlocutor and utterance semantics and would enhance the conversation understanding process. To this end, we present MPC-BERT, a pre-trained model for MPC understanding that considers learning who says what to whom in a unified model with several elaborated self-supervised tasks. Particularly, these tasks can be generally categorized into (1) interlocutor structure modeling including reply-to utterance recognition, identical speaker searching and pointer consistency distinction, and (2) utterance semantics modeling including masked shared utterance restoration and shared node detection. We evaluate MPC-BERT on three downstream tasks including addressee recognition, speaker identification and response selection. Experimental results show that MPC-BERT outperforms previous methods by large margins and achieves new state-of-the-art performance on all three downstream tasks at two benchmarks.",

Both approaches can improve the performance of fully-supervised methods with additional unlabeled data. However, as a fundamental task, semi-supervised object detection has not gained enough attention in the field of medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-Supervised Medical image Detector (SSMD). The motivation behind SSMD is to provide free yet effective supervision for unlabeled data, by regularizing the predictions at each position to be consistent. To achieve the above idea, we develop a novel adaptive consistency cost function to regularize different components in the predictions. Moreover, we introduce heterogeneous perturbation strategies that work in both feature space and image space, so that the proposed detector is promising to produce powerful image representations and robust predictions. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed SSMD achieves the state-of-the-art performance at a wide range of settings. We also demonstrate the strength of each proposed module with comprehensive ablation studies.",

However, experiment methods are difficult to obtain the whole flow field information and also high-cost while numerical simulation is extraordinary time-consuming and limited in low Reynolds number and simple geometric configuration. In addition, numerical simulations are difficult to handle the moving mesh technique. In this paper, physics informed neural network (PINN) is proposed to solve the VIV and wake-induced vibration (WIV) of cylinder with high Reynolds number. Compared to tradition data-driven neural network, the Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation, by implanting an additional turbulent eddy viscosity, coupled with structure's dynamic motion equation are also embedded into the loss function. Training and validation data is obtained by computational fluid dynamic (CFD) technique. Three scenarios are proposed to validate the performance of PINN in solving VIV and WIV of cylinders. In the first place, the stiffness parameter and damping parameter are calculated via limited force data and displacement data; secondly, the flow field and lifting force/drag force are inferred by scattered velocity information; eventually, the displacement can be directly predicted only through lifting forces and drag forces based on LSTM. Results demonstrate that,compared with traditional neural network, PINN method is more effective in inferring and re-constructing the unknown parameters and flow field with high Reynolds number under VIV and WIV circumstances.",

Hence, this paper investigates ViTs and MLP-Mixers from the lens of loss geometry, intending to improve the models' data efficiency at training and generalization at inference. Visualization and Hessian reveal extremely sharp local minima of converged models. By promoting smoothness with a recently proposed sharpness-aware optimizer, we substantially improve the accuracy and robustness of ViTs and MLP-Mixers on various tasks spanning supervised, adversarial, contrastive, and transfer learning (e.g., +5.3\\% and +11.0\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet for ViT-B/16 and Mixer-B/16, respectively, with the simple Inception-style preprocessing). We show that the improved smoothness attributes to sparser active neurons in the first few layers. The resultant ViTs outperform ResNets of similar size and throughput when trained from scratch on ImageNet without large-scale pretraining or strong data augmentations. They also possess more perceptive attention maps.",

However, the joint THz radar and communication (JRC) system faces considerable challenges, due to the peculiarities of the THz channel and front ends. To this end, the waveform design for THz-JRC systems with ultra-broad bandwidth is investigated in this paper. Firstly, by considering THz-JRC systems based on the co-existence concept, where both functions operate in a time-domain duplex (TDD) manner, a novel multi-subband quasi-perfect (MS-QP) sequence, composed of multiple Zadoff-Chu (ZC) perfect subsequences on different subbands, is proposed for target sensing, which achieves accurate target ranging and velocity estimation, whilst only requiring cost-efficient low-rate analog-to-digital converters (A/Ds) for sequence detection. Furthermore, the root index of each ZC subsequence of the MS-QP sequence is designed to eliminate the influence of doppler shift on the THz radar sensing. Finally, a data-embedded MS-QP (DE-MS-QP) waveform is constructed through time-domain extension of the MS-QP sequence, generating null frequency points on each subband for data transmission. Unlike the THz-JRC system in TDD manner, the proposed DE-MS-QP waveform enables simultaneous interference-free sensing and communication, whilst inheriting all the merits from MS-QP sequences. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed waveforms in terms of sensing performance, hardware cost and flexible resource allocation over their conventional counterparts.",

In this work, by presenting a family of the generalized Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, we show that the $N$-qubit GHZ states can be indeed identified by the maximal violations of the generalized CHSH inequality under some specific measurement settings. The generalized CHSH inequality is simple and contains only four correlation functions for any $N$-qubit system, thus has the merit of facilitating experimental verification. Furthermore, we present a quantum phenomenon of robust violations of the generalized CHSH inequality, in which the maximal violation of Bell's inequality can be robust under some specific noises adding to the $N$-qubit GHZ states.",

We address them by proposing a local emulator which combines a GP classifier and a GP regression model.

In this paper, we propose a novel positional encoding scheme, called Spline Positional Encoding, to map the input coordinates to a high dimensional space before passing them to MLPs, for helping to recover 3D signed distance fields with fine-scale geometric details from unorganized 3D point clouds. We verified the superiority of our approach over other positional encoding schemes on tasks of 3D shape reconstruction from input point clouds and shape space learning. The efficacy of our approach extended to image reconstruction is also demonstrated and evaluated.",

In our previous study we discovered solvatochromism of EGCG fluorescence and described the dependence of fluorescence maxima on solvent polarity. We also noted that fluorescence intensity (FI) depends on solvent. The goal of this study was to gain insights into how the protonic properties of the environment affect FI. We demonstrate that 1) FI of EGCG inversely correlates with the autoprotolysis constant (Kap) of the solvents, 2) HCl decreases, and NaOH increases FI of EGCG in water, and 3) NaOH evokes slow (~10 min time scale) transient changes in FI of EGCG. We conclude that EGCG fluorescence depends on Kap, i.e. protonicity of the environment, that is useful for differentiating EGCG in protic aqueous environment at physiological pH~7.0\u00f77.4, where EGCG fluorescence is substantially quenched, from EGCG in aprotic environments, where EGCG fluorescence significantly increases. Thus, this property of EGCG fluorescence is useful for investigation of specific EGCG interactions within more aprotic protein binding sites.",

We search \\textit{Fermi} data for prompt emission, setting deeper upper limits on the prompt emission than in the original detection paper. Together with \\konus{} observations, we show that the gamma-ray efficiency of AT2020blt is $\\lesssim 2.8\\%$, lower than $98.4\\%$ of observed gamma-ray bursts. We speculate that AT2020blt and AT2021any belong to the low-efficiency tail of long gamma-ray burst distributions that are beginning to be readily observed due to the capabilities of new observatories like the Zwicky Transient Facility.",

Such small bodies feel strong gas drag and their orbits are significantly affected by the gas flow and atmospheric structure around the planet. We investigate the gas flow in the protoplanetary disk perturbed by the gravity of the planet by three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation. We then calculate the orbital evolutions of particles in the gas structure obtained from the hydrodynamic simulation. Based on the orbital calculations, we obtain the collision rate between the planet and centimeter to kilometer sized particles. Our results show that meter-sized or larger particles effectively collide with the planet due to the atmospheric gas drag, which significantly enhances the collision rate. On the other hand, the gas flow plays an important role for smaller particles. Finally, considering the effects of the atmosphere and gas flow, we derive the new analytic formula for the collision rate, which is in good agreement with our simulations. We estimate the growth timescale and accretion efficiency of drifting bodies for the formation of a gas-giant solid core using the formula. We find the accretion of sub-kilometer sized bodies achieve a short growth timescale (~0.05 Myr) and a high accretion efficiency (~1) for the core formation at 5 au in the minimum mass solar nebula model.",

Prior work has considered extracting document-level entity clusters and relations end-to-end from raw scientific text, which can improve literature search and help identify methods and materials for a given problem. Despite the importance of this task, most existing works on scientific information extraction (SciIE) consider extraction solely based on the content of an individual paper, without considering the paper's place in the broader literature. In contrast to prior work, we augment our text representations by leveraging a complementary source of document context: the citation graph of referential links between citing and cited papers. On a test set of English-language scientific documents, we show that simple ways of utilizing the structure and content of the citation graph can each lead to significant gains in different scientific information extraction tasks. When these tasks are combined, we observe a sizable improvement in end-to-end information extraction over the state-of-the-art, suggesting the potential for future work along this direction. We release software tools to facilitate citation-aware SciIE development.",

Unfortunately, the class of smooth functionals for which this is easily possible is very restricted. Here, we prove an infinite dimensional Gaussian smoothing inequality, which enables the class of functionals to be greatly expanded -- examples are Lipschitz functionals with respect to the uniform metric, and indicators of arbitrary events -- in exchange for a loss of precision in the bounds. Our inequalities are expressed in terms of the smooth test function bound, an expectation of a functional of $X$ that is closely related to classical tightness criteria, a similar expectation for $Z$, and, for the indicator of a set $K$, the probability $\\mathbb{P}(Z \\in K^\\theta \\setminus K^{-\\theta})$ that the target process is close to the boundary of $K$.",

The density modulation of a plasma grating can approach unity since the plasma is produced only where the two pulses constructively interfere and ionization does not occur in destructive interference regions. Such a large density modulation leads to efficient Thomson scattering of a second ultra-short probe pulse once the Bragg condition is satisfied. By measuring the scattering efficiency, it is possible to determine the absolute electron density in the plasma grating and thereby deduce the ionization degree for a given neutral gas density. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of this concept by showing two applications: ionization degree measurement of strong-field ionization of atoms and molecules and characterization of extremely low-density gas jets. The former application is of particular interest for ionization physics studies in dense gases where the collision of the ionized electron with neighboring neutrals may become important-sometimes referred to as many-body ionization, and the latter is useful for plasma-based acceleration that requires extremely low-density plasmas.",

The advent of large-scale surveys has hastened the need to develop techniques for automated morphological classification. We train and test several convolutional neural network architectures to classify the morphologies of galaxies in both a 3-class (elliptical, lenticular, spiral) and 4-class (+irregular/miscellaneous) schema with a dataset of 14034 visually-classified SDSS images. We develop a new CNN architecture that outperforms existing models in both 3 and 4-way classification, with overall classification accuracies of 83% and 81% respectively. We also compare the accuracies of 2-way / binary classifications between all four classes, showing that ellipticals and spirals are most easily distinguished (>98% accuracy), while spirals and irregulars are hardest to differentiate (78% accuracy). Through an analysis of all classified samples, we find tentative evidence that misclassifications are physically meaningful, with lenticulars misclassified as ellipticals tending to be more massive, among other trends. We further combine our binary CNN classifiers to perform a hierarchical classification of samples, obtaining comparable accuracies (81%) to the direct 3-class CNN, but considerably worse accuracies in the 4-way case (65%). As an additional verification, we apply our networks to a small sample of Galaxy Zoo images, obtaining accuracies of 92%, 82% and 77% for the binary, 3-way and 4-way classifications respectively.",

In this paper, we propose irregularly clipped SR codes, where multiple clipping thresholds are applied to symbols according to a distribution, to further improve the SER performance of SR codes. Orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm is used for decoding. Using state evolution, the distribution of irregular clipping thresholds is optimized to minimize the SER of OAMP decoding. As a result, optimized irregularly clipped SR codes achieve a better tradeoff between clipping distortion and noise distortion than regularly clipped SR codes. Numerical results demonstrate that irregularly clipped SR codes achieve 0.4 dB gain in signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) over regularly clipped SR codes at code length$\\,\\approx2.5\\!\\times\\! 10^4$ and SER$\\,\\approx10^{-5}$.

While some conventional multiple imputation approaches are well studied and have shown empirical validity, they entail limitations in processing large datasets with complex data structures. Their imputation performances usually rely on expert knowledge of the inherent relations among variables. In addition, these standard approaches tend to be computationally inefficient for medium and large datasets. In this paper, we propose a scalable multiple imputation framework mixgb, which is based on XGBoost, bootstrapping and predictive mean matching. XGBoost, one of the fastest implementations of gradient boosted trees, is able to automatically retain interactions and non-linear relations in a dataset while achieving high computational efficiency. With the aid of bootstrapping and predictive mean matching, we show that our approach obtains less biased estimates and reflects appropriate imputation variability. The proposed framework is implemented in an R package misle. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.",

However, such a thermodynamic system is usually driven by electron reservoirs at different temperatures, not by a lattice temperature gradient. We report on experimental observations of charge-spin cooperative dynamics in transitions of two-electron spin states in a GaAs double quantum dot located in a non-equilibrium phonon environment. Enhancements in the spin-flip processes are observed, originating from phonon excitation combined with the spin-orbit interaction. In addition, due to the spatial gradient of phonon density between the dots, the spin-flip rate during an inter-dot electron tunnel from a hot to a cold dot is more enhanced than in the other direction, resulting in accumulation of parallel spin states in the double dot.",

The algorithm is named Triple-Q because it has three key components: a Q-function (also called action-value function) for the cumulative reward, a Q-function for the cumulative utility for the constraint, and a virtual-Queue that (over)-estimates the cumulative constraint violation. Under Triple-Q, at each step, an action is chosen based on the pseudo-Q-value that is a combination of the three Q values. The algorithm updates the reward and utility Q-values with learning rates that depend on the visit counts to the corresponding (state, action) pairs and are periodically reset. In the episodic CMDP setting, Triple-Q achieves $\\tilde{\\cal O}\\left(\\frac{1 }{\\delta}H^4 S^{\\frac{1}{2}}A^{\\frac{1}{2}}K^{\\frac{4}{5}} \\right)$ regret, where $K$ is the total number of episodes, $H$ is the number of steps in each episode, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $\\delta$ is Slater's constant. Furthermore, Triple-Q guarantees zero constraint violation when $K$ is sufficiently large. Finally, the computational complexity of Triple-Q is similar to SARSA for unconstrained MDPs and is computationally efficient.",

        "abstract": "A high-order Flux reconstruction implementation of the hyperbolic formulation for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation is presented. The governing equations employ Chorin's classical artificial compressibility (AC) formulation cast in hyperbolic form. Instead of splitting the second-order conservation law into two equations, one for the solution and another for the gradient, the Navier-Stokes equation is cast into a first-order hyperbolic system of equations. Including the gradients in the AC iterative process results in a significant improvement in accuracy for the pressure, velocity, and its gradients. Furthermore, this treatment allows for taking larger time-steps since the hyperbolic formulation eliminates the restriction due to diffusion. Tests using the method of manufactured solutions show that solving the conventional form of the Navier-Stokes equation lowers the order of accuracy for gradients, while the hyperbolic method is shown to provide equal orders of accuracy for both the velocity and its gradients which may be beneficial in several applications. Two- and three-dimensional benchmark tests demonstrate the superior accuracy and computational efficiency of the developed solver in comparison to the conventional method and other published works. This study shows that the developed high-order hyperbolic solver for incompressible flows is attractive due to its accuracy, stability and efficiency in solving diffusion dominated problems.",

Concretely, we ground this question in the sandbox of probabilistic context-free-grammars (PCFGs), and identify a key aspect of the representational power of these approaches: the amount and directionality of context that the predictor has access to when forced to make parsing decision. We show that with limited context (either bounded, or unidirectional), there are PCFGs, for which these approaches cannot represent the max-likelihood parse; conversely, if the context is unlimited, they can represent the max-likelihood parse of any PCFG.",

But despite these improved metrics, there is limited understanding of the strategies different models employ, and how those strategies relate their understanding of language. To understand this better, we run several experiments to characterize how one popular abstractive model, the pointer-generator model of See et al. (2017), uses its explicit copy/generation switch to control its level of abstraction (generation) vs extraction (copying). On an extractive-biased dataset, the model utilizes syntactic boundaries to truncate sentences that are otherwise often copied verbatim. When we modify the copy/generation switch and force the model to generate, only simple paraphrasing abilities are revealed alongside factual inaccuracies and hallucinations. On an abstractive-biased dataset, the model copies infrequently but shows similarly limited abstractive abilities. In line with previous research, these results suggest that abstractive summarization models lack the semantic understanding necessary to generate paraphrases that are both abstractive and faithful to the source document.",

The feasibility of exfoliation is confirmed by the rather low exfoliation energy of 0.27 J/m$^2$, even smaller than that of graphite. In exfoliated Cr(pyz)$_2$ monolayer, each pyrazine ring grabs one electron from the Cr atom to become a radical anion, then a strong $d$-$p$ direct exchange magnetic interaction emerges between Cr cations and pyrazine radicals, resulting in room temperature ferrimagnetism with a Curie temperature of 342 K. Moreover, Cr(pyz)$_2$ monolayer is revealed to be an intrinsic bipolar magnetic semiconductor where electrical doping can induce half-metallic conduction with controllable spin-polarization direction.",

Existing models were designed for the nodes on a single graph, which would not be able to utilize information across multiple graphs. The real world does have multiple graphs where the nodes are often partially aligned. For examples, knowledge graphs share a number of named entities though they may have different relation schema; collaboration networks on publications and awarded projects share some researcher nodes who are authors and investigators, respectively; people use multiple web services, shopping, tweeting, rating movies, and some may register the same email account across the platforms. In this paper, I propose partially aligned graph convolutional networks to learn node representations across the models. I investigate multiple methods (including model sharing, regularization, and alignment reconstruction) as well as theoretical analysis to positively transfer knowledge across the (small) set of partially aligned nodes. Extensive experiments on real-world knowledge graphs and collaboration networks show the superior performance of our proposed methods on relation classification and link prediction.",

General dimensionality reduction techniques can alleviate such difficulty by extracting a few important features, but they are limited due to the lack of interpretability and connectivity to actual decision making associated with each physical variable. Important variable selection techniques, as an alternative, can maintain the interpretability, but they often involve a greedy search that is susceptible to failure in capturing important interactions. This research proposes a new method that produces subspaces, reduced-dimensional physical spaces, based on a randomized search and forms an ensemble of models for critical subspaces. When applied to high-dimensional data collected from a composite metal development process, the proposed method shows its superiority in prediction and important variable selection.",

We set up a novel evaluation framework with two evaluation tasks, few-shot link prediction and analogical reasoning, and evaluate an array of KB-text embedding alignment methods.

        "abstract": "Smart distribution grid with multiple renewable energy sources can experience random voltage fluctuations due to variable generation, which may result in voltage violations. Traditional voltage control algorithms are inadequate to handle fast voltage variations. Therefore, new dynamic control methods are being developed that can significantly benefit from the knowledge of dominant voltage influencer (DVI) nodes. DVI nodes for a particular node of interest refer to nodes that have a relatively high impact on the voltage fluctuations at that node. Conventional power flow-based algorithms to identify DVI nodes are computationally complex, which limits their use in real-time applications. This paper proposes a novel information theoretic voltage influencing score (VIS) that quantifies the voltage influencing capacity of nodes with DERs/active loads in a three phase unbalanced distribution system. VIS is then employed to rank the nodes and identify the DVI set. VIS is derived analytically in a computationally efficient manner and its efficacy to identify DVI nodes is validated using the IEEE 37-node test system. It is shown through experiments that KL divergence and Bhattacharyya distance are effective indicators of DVI nodes with an identifying accuracy of more than 90%. The computation burden is also reduced by an order of 5, thus providing the foundation for efficient voltage control.",

Nevertheless, it is of great significance to analyze the direction of predominant sentiment from the sentiment communication perspective. In this paper, the information emotion propagation model is established by introducing revamp genetic algorithms into information emotion. In the process of information dissemination, both the information emotions and the network emotions are dynamic. For this model, the information emotions and the network nodes emotions are quantified as binary codes. The convergence effects, crossover and mutation algorithms are introduced. These factors all act on the transmission process via dynamic propagation rate, and the improved genetic algorithm also acts on the emotion transmission. In particular, the latter two algorithms are different from the existing biological domain. Based on the existing research results in other manuscripts, we perform simulation described above on the hybrid network. The simulation results demonstrate that the trend approximate to the actual data. As a result, our work can prove that our proposed model is essentially consistent with the actual emotion transmission phenomenon.",

Using Fujikawa's method, it is found that the anomalies associated with the $U(N)_+\\times U(N)_-$ chiral symmetry and $U(N)$ flavor symmetry for even and odd dimensions, respectively, can be written in terms of superconnections. In particular, the anomaly for a vector-like $U(1)$ symmetry is given by the Chern character of the superconnection in both even and odd dimensional cases. It is also argued that the non-Abelian anomaly for a system in D-dimensional spacetime is characterized by a (D+2)-form part of the Chern character of the superconnection which generalizes the usual anomaly polynomial for the massless case. These results enable us to analyze anomalies in the systems with interfaces and spacetime boundaries in a unified way. Applications to index theorems, including Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem and Callias-type index theorem, are also discussed. In addition, we give a natural string theory interpretation of these results.",

However, the performance of the GNSS positioning is significantly challenged in urban canyons, due to the signal reflection and blockage from buildings. Given the fact that the GNSS measurements are highly environmentally dependent and time-correlated, the conventional filtering-based method for GNSS positioning cannot simultaneously explore the time-correlation among historical measurements. As a result, the filtering-based estimator is sensitive to unexpected outlier measurements. In this paper, we present a factor graph-based formulation for GNSS positioning and real-time kinematic (RTK). The formulated factor graph framework effectively explores the time-correlation of pseudorange, carrier-phase, and doppler measurements, and leads to the non-minimal state estimation of the GNSS receiver. The feasibility of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets collected in challenging urban canyons of Hong Kong and significantly improved positioning accuracy is obtained, compared with the filtering-based estimator.",

Formally, Cartesian-tree pattern matching seeks all substrings $S'$ of the text string $S$ such that the Cartesian tree of $S'$ and that of a query pattern $P$ coincide. In this paper, we present a new indexing structure for this problem called the Cartesian-tree Position Heap (CPH). Let $n$ be the length of the input text string $S$, $m$ the length of a query pattern $P$, and $\\sigma$ the alphabet size. We show that the CPH of $S$, denoted $\\mathsf{CPH}(S)$, supports pattern matching queries in $O(m (\\sigma + \\log (\\min\\{h, m\\})) + occ)$ time with $O(n)$ space, where $h$ is the height of the CPH and $occ$ is the number of pattern occurrences. We show how to build $\\mathsf{CPH}(S)$ in $O(n \\log \\sigma)$ time with $O(n)$ working space. Further, we extend the problem to the case where the text is a labeled tree (i.e. a trie). Given a trie $T$ with $N$ nodes, we show that the CPH of $T$, denoted $\\mathsf{CPH}(T)$, supports pattern matching queries on the trie in $O(m (\\sigma^2 + \\log (\\min\\{h, m\\})) + occ)$ time with $O(N \\sigma)$ space.

However, its overall success of embedding local and spatial variant features is still limited, especially for semantic segmentation. In a per-pixel prediction task, more than one label can exist in a single image for segmentation (e.g., an image contains both cat, dog, and grass), thereby it is difficult to define 'positive' or 'negative' pairs in a canonical contrastive learning setting. In this paper, we propose an attention-guided supervised contrastive learning approach to highlight a single semantic object every time as the target. With our design, the same image can be embedded to different semantic clusters with semantic attention (i.e., coerce semantic masks) as an additional input channel. To achieve such attention, a novel two-stage training strategy is presented. We evaluate the proposed method on multi-organ medical image segmentation task, as our major task, with both in-house data and BTCV 2015 datasets. Comparing with the supervised and semi-supervised training state-of-the-art in the backbone of ResNet-50, our proposed pipeline yields substantial improvement of 5.53% and 6.09% in Dice score for both medical image segmentation cohorts respectively. The performance of the proposed method on natural images is assessed via PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, and achieves 2.75% substantial improvement.",

In this framework, we further pre-train mBART sequence-to-sequence denoising auto-encoder model with an auxiliary task using monolingual data of three languages. The objective function of the auxiliary task is close to the target tasks which enriches the multi-lingual latent representation of mBART and provides good initialization for target tasks. Then, this model is fine-tuned with task-specific supervised English data and directly evaluated with low-resource languages in the Zero-shot setting. To overcome catastrophic forgetting and spurious correlation issues, we applied freezing model component and data argumentation approaches respectively. This simple modeling approach gave us promising results.We experimented with few-shot training (with 1000 supervised data points) which boosted the model performance further. We performed several ablations and cross-lingual transferability analyses to demonstrate the robustness of ZmBART.",

Previous TURs for underdamped Langevin dynamics is neither experimentally accessible nor reduced to the original form of the overdamped Langevin dynamics in the zero-mass limit. Here, we find an operationally accessible TUR for underdamped Langevin dynamics with an arbitrary time-dependent protocol. We show that the original TUR is a consequence of our underdamped TUR in the zero-mass limit. This indicates that the TUR formulation presented here can be regarded as the universal form of the TUR for general Langevin dynamics. The validity of our result is examined and confirmed for three prototypical underdamped Langevin systems and their zero-mass limits; free diffusion dynamics, charged Brownian particle in a magnetic field, and molecular refrigerator.",

Disproportional event distribution for different demographic groups can manifest and amplify social stereotypes, and potentially jeopardize the ability of members in some groups to pursue certain goals. In this paper, we present the first event-centric study of gender biases in a Wikipedia corpus. To facilitate the study, we curate a corpus of career and personal life descriptions with demographic information consisting of 7,854 fragments from 10,412 celebrities. Then we detect events with a state-of-the-art event detection model, calibrate the results using strategically generated templates, and extract events that have asymmetric associations with genders. Our study discovers that the Wikipedia pages tend to intermingle personal life events with professional events for females but not for males, which calls for the awareness of the Wikipedia community to formalize guidelines and train the editors to mind the implicit biases that contributors carry. Our work also lays the foundation for future works on quantifying and discovering event biases at the corpus level.",

The aim is to check whether the relationships the model poses among the various observables are actually found in the data. The study case of the second through the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Italy is taken. Given its scale invariance, initially the model is tested with reference to the curve of swab-confirmed infectious individuals only. It is found to match the data if the given curve of the {\\em removed} (that is healed or deceased) individuals is assumed underestimated by a factor of about 3 together with other related curves. Contextually, the {\\em generation time} and the {\\em removal period}, as well as the {\\em effective reproduction number}, are obtained fitting the SIR equations to the data; the outcomes prove to be in good agreement with those of other works. Then, using knowledge of the proportion of Covid-19 transmissions likely occurring from individuals who didn't develop symptoms, thus mainly undetected, an estimate of the {\\em \"true numbers\"} of the epidemic is obtained, looking also in good agreement with results from other, completely different works.

We first demonstrate that deep networks have sufficient capacity to memorize adversarial examples of training data with completely random labels, but not all AT algorithms can converge under the extreme circumstance. Our study of AT with random labels motivates further analyses on the convergence and generalization of AT. We find that some AT methods suffer from a gradient instability issue, and the recently suggested complexity measures cannot explain robust generalization by considering models trained on random labels. Furthermore, we identify a significant drawback of memorization in AT that it could result in robust overfitting. We then propose a new mitigation algorithm motivated by detailed memorization analyses. Extensive experiments on various datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

In this work, we investigate the validity of learning results of some widely used DR and ManL methods through the chart mapping function of a manifold. We identify a fundamental problem of these methods: the mapping functions induced by these methods violate the basic settings of manifolds, and hence they are not learning manifold in the mathematical sense. To address this problem, we provide a provably correct algorithm called fixed points Laplacian mapping (FPLM), that has the geometric guarantee to find a valid manifold representation (up to a homeomorphism). Combining one additional condition(orientation preserving), we discuss a sufficient condition for an algorithm to be bijective for any d-simplex decomposition result on a d-manifold. However, constructing such a mapping function and its computational method satisfying these conditions is still an open problem in mathematics.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the problem of Chinese Grammatical Error Correction (CGEC) and present a new framework named Tail-to-Tail (\\textbf{TtT}) non-autoregressive sequence prediction to address the deep issues hidden in CGEC. Considering that most tokens are correct and can be conveyed directly from source to target, and the error positions can be estimated and corrected based on the bidirectional context information, thus we employ a BERT-initialized Transformer Encoder as the backbone model to conduct information modeling and conveying. Considering that only relying on the same position substitution cannot handle the variable-length correction cases, various operations such substitution, deletion, insertion, and local paraphrasing are required jointly. Therefore, a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) layer is stacked on the up tail to conduct non-autoregressive sequence prediction by modeling the token dependencies. Since most tokens are correct and easily to be predicted/conveyed to the target, then the models may suffer from a severe class imbalance issue. To alleviate this problem, focal loss penalty strategies are integrated into the loss functions. Moreover, besides the typical fix-length error correction datasets, we also construct a variable-length corpus to conduct experiments. Experimental results on standard datasets, especially on the variable-length datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of TtT in terms of sentence-level Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Measure on tasks of error Detection and Correction.",

We systematically study the dependence on field strength, microwave polarization, and detuning from rotational transitions. We calculate the loss in two-body collisions that is observable experimentally and compare to the results expected for purely first-order dipolar interactions. For ground state molecules polarized by a static electric field, the dynamics are accurately described by first-order dipolar interactions. For microwave dressing, instead, resonant dipolar collisions dominate the collision process, in which molecules reorient along the intermolecular axis and interact with the full strength of the transition dipole. For red detuning, reorientation can only be suppressed at extreme Rabi frequencies. For blue detuned microwaves, resonant dipolar interactions dominate even for high Rabi frequencies, leading to microwave shielding for circular polarization and structured losses due to resonances for linear polarization. The results are presented numerically for fermionic $^{23}$Na$^{40}$K and bosonic $^{23}$Na$^{39}$K molecules.",

        "abstract": "XRISM is an X-ray astronomical mission by the JAXA, NASA, ESA and other international participants, that is planned for launch in 2022 (Japanese fiscal year), to quickly restore high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of astrophysical objects. To enhance the scientific outputs of the mission, the Science Operations Team (SOT) is structured independently from the instrument teams and the Mission Operations Team. The responsibilities of the SOT are divided into four categories: 1) guest observer program and data distributions, 2) distribution of analysis software and the calibration database, 3) guest observer support activities, and 4) performance verification and optimization activities. As the first step, lessons on the science operations learned from past Japanese X-ray missions are reviewed, and 15 kinds of lessons are identified. Among them, a) the importance of early preparation of the operations from the ground stage, b) construction of an independent team for science operations separate from the instrument development, and c) operations with well-defined duties by appointed members are recognized as key lessons. Then, the team structure and the task division between the mission and science operations are defined; the tasks are shared among Japan, US, and Europe and are performed by three centers, the SOC, SDC, and ESAC, respectively. The SOC is designed to perform tasks close to the spacecraft operations, such as spacecraft planning, quick-look health checks, pre-pipeline processing, etc., and the SDC covers tasks regarding data calibration processing, maintenance of analysis tools, etc. The data-archive and user-support activities are covered both by the SOC and SDC. Finally, the science-operations tasks and tools are defined and prepared before launch.",

In this work, we propose a neural GAM (NODE-GAM) and neural GA$^2$M (NODE-GA$^2$M) that scale well to large datasets, while remaining interpretable and accurate. We show that our proposed models have comparable accuracy to other non-interpretable models, and outperform other GAMs on large datasets.

In this work, the Adler function and the scalar correlator are investigated, and models for Borel transforms of their perturbative series are constructed, which respect general constraints from the operator product expansion and the renormalisation group. As a novel ingredient, the QCD coupling is employed in the so-called $C$-scheme, which has certain advantages. For the Adler function, previous results obtained directly in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme are supported. Corresponding results for the scalar correlation function are new. It turns out that the substantially larger perturbative corrections for the scalar correlator in $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ are dominantly due to this scheme choice, and can be largely reduced through more appropriate renormalisation schemes, which are easy to realise in the $C$-scheme.",

Many methods have been proposed to detect fake images, but they are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations -- intentionally designed noises that can lead to the wrong prediction. Existing methods of attacking fake image detectors usually generate adversarial perturbations to perturb almost the entire image. This is redundant and increases the perceptibility of perturbations. In this paper, we propose a novel method to disrupt the fake image detection by determining key pixels to a fake image detector and attacking only the key pixels, which results in the $L_0$ and the $L_2$ norms of adversarial perturbations much less than those of existing works. Experiments on two public datasets with three fake image detectors indicate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both white-box and black-box attacks.",

The key challenges faced in developing the data management plan for such a large and complex project were to generate an overview of the enormous amount of data that will be produced, to build an understanding of the data flow within the project and to agree on a roadmap for making all data FAIR. This paper describes the process we followed and how we structured the plan.",

At present, black-box attack methods mainly adopt gradient-based iterative attack methods, which usually limit the relationship between the iteration step size, the number of iterations, and the maximum perturbation. In this paper, we propose a new gradient iteration framework, which redefines the relationship between the above three. Under this framework, we easily improve the attack success rate of DI-TI-MIM. In addition, we propose a gradient iterative attack method based on input dropout, which can be well combined with our framework. We further propose a multi dropout rate version of this method. Experimental results show that our best method can achieve attack success rate of 96.2\\% for defense model on average, which is higher than the state-of-the-art gradient-based attacks.",

The vulnerability has led to a surge of research in this direction, including adversarial attacks on object detection networks. However, previous studies are dedicated to attacking anchor-based object detectors. In this paper, we present the first adversarial attack on anchor-free object detectors. It conducts category-wise, instead of previously instance-wise, attacks on object detectors, and leverages high-level semantic information to efficiently generate transferable adversarial examples, which can also be transferred to attack other object detectors, even anchor-based detectors such as Faster R-CNN. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and transferability.",

A particular strength of this method is its straightforward access to imaginary-time correlation functions (ITCF). For example, the well-known density--density ITCF $F(\\mathbf{q},\\tau)$ allows one to estimate the linear response of a given system for all wave vectors $\\mathbf{q}$ from a single simulation of the unperturbed system. Moreover, it constitutes the basis for the reconstruction of the dynamic structure factor $S(\\mathbf{q},\\omega)$ -- a key quantity in state-of-the-art scattering experiments. In this work, we present analogous relations between the nonlinear density response in quadratic and cubic order of the perturbation strength and generalized ITCFs measuring correlations between up to four imaginary-time arguments. As a practical demonstration of our new approach, we carry out simulations of the warm dense electron gas and find excellent agreement with previous PIMC results that had been obtained with substantially larger computational effort. In addition, we give a relation between a cubic ITCF and the triple dynamic structure factor $S(\\mathbf{q}_1,\\omega_1;\\mathbf{q}_2,\\omega_2)$, which evokes the enticing possibility to study dynamic three-body effects on an \\emph{ab initio} level.",

This approach not only decreases computational complexity but it can save and even increase (for the AudioSet dataset) the performance for audio pattern recognition tasks.

We code the model in the pySTGROMX package that speeds up the calculations at two and even three orders of magnitude and yet still keeps accuracy at $\\sim1\\%$ level. Using the package, we can predict all the post-Keplerian parameters in the timing of binary pulsars conveniently, which allows us to place comprehensive constraints on the DEF theory in a quick and sound way. As an application, we perform Markov-chain Monte Carlo simulations to constrain the parameters of the DEF theory with well-timed binary pulsars. Utilizing five NS-white dwarf and three NS-NS binaries, we obtain the most stringent constraints on the DEF theory up to now. Our work provides a public tool for quick evaluation of NSs' derived parameters to test gravity in the strong-field regime.",

In this paper, we design a three-module pipeline approach to effectively improve the diversity and relevance. Our proposed pipeline first generates various counterspeech candidates by a generative model to promote diversity, then filters the ungrammatical ones using a BERT model, and finally selects the most relevant counterspeech response using a novel retrieval-based method.

The most recent AMS-02 result is the measurement of the spectrum of CR fluorine up to $\\sim$2 TV. Given its very low solar system abundance, fluorine in CRs is thought to be mostly secondary, produced in fragmentations of heavier species, predominantly Ne, Mg, and Si. Similar to the best-measured secondary-to-primary boron to carbon nuclei ratio that is widely used to study the origin and propagation of CR species, the precise fluorine data would allow the origin of Si-group nuclei to be studied independently. Meanwhile, the secondary origin of CR fluorine has never been tested in a wide energy range due to the lack of accurate CR data. In this paper, we use the first ever precise measurements of the fluorine spectrum by AMS-02 together with ACE-CRIS and Voyager 1 data to actually test this paradigm. Our detailed modeling shows an excess below 10 GV in the fluorine spectrum that is most likely due to the primary fluorine component. We also provide an updated local interstellar spectrum (LIS) of fluorine in the rigidity range from few MV to $\\sim$2 TV. Our calculations employ the self-consistent GalProp-HelMod framework that has proved to be a reliable tool in deriving the LIS of CR $\\bar{p}$, $e^{-}$, and nuclei $Z\\le28$.",

        "abstract": "In this position paper we approach problems concerning critical digital and information literacy with ideas to provide more digestible explanations of abstract concepts through interface design. In particular, we focus on social media platforms where we see the possibility of counteracting the spread of misinformation by providing users with more proficiency through our approaches. We argue that the omnipresent trend to abstract away and hide information from users via UI/UX design opposes their ability to self-learn. This leads us to propose a different framework in which we unify elegant and simple interfaces with nudges that promote a look behind the curtain. Such designs serve to foster a deeper understanding of employed technologies and aim to increase the critical assessment of content encountered on social platforms. Furthermore, we consider users with an intermediary skill level to be largely ignored in current approaches, as they are given no tools to broaden their knowledge without consultation of expert material. The resulting stagnation is exemplified by the tactics of misinformation campaigns, which exploit the ensuing lack of information literacy and critical thinking. We propose an approach to design that sufficiently emancipates users in both aspects by promoting a look behind the abstraction of UI/UX so that an autonomous learning process is given the chance to occur. Furthermore, we name ideas for future research within this area that take our considerations into account.",

Previous works break down scene generation into two consecutive phases: unconditional semantic layout synthesis and image synthesis conditioned on layouts. In this work, we propose to condition layout generation as well for higher semantic control: given a vector of class proportions, we generate layouts with matching composition. To this end, we introduce a conditional framework with novel architecture designs and learning objectives, which effectively accommodates class proportions to guide the scene generation process. The proposed architecture also allows partial layout editing with interesting applications. Thanks to the semantic control, we can produce layouts close to the real distribution, helping enhance the whole scene generation process. On different metrics and urban scene benchmarks, our models outperform existing baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate the merit of our approach for data augmentation: semantic segmenters trained on real layout-image pairs along with additional ones generated by our approach outperform models only trained on real pairs.",

This result provides a promising platform for realizing the time-reversal breaking correlated topological phases.

Unlike the spin-wave emission from a spin-orbit-torque driven AFM DW motion, the dEa/dx-induced spin-wave emission originates from the DW acceleration instead of the Lorentz contraction. The DW acceleration effectuates a strong DW precession at the moderate exchange integral. When the DW precession frequency is greater than the frequency gap of spin waves in the AFM medium, a continuous THz spin wave is resonantly emitted. Because dEa/dx can be readily generated under a DC voltage, our work provides a feasible approach for the development of on-chip THz spintronic devices with low dissipations.",

This work introduces Cybersecurity Information Exchangewith Privacy (CYBEX-P), as a CIS framework, to tackle these challenges. CYBEX-P allows organizations to share heterogeneous data with granular, attribute based privacy control. It correlates the data to automatically generate intuitive reports and defensive rules. To achieve such versatility, we have developed TAHOE - a graph based CTL. TAHOE is a structure for storing,sharing and analyzing threat data. It also intrinsically correlates the data. We have further developed a universal Threat Data Query Language (TDQL). In this paper, we propose the system architecture for CYBEX-P. We then discuss its scalability and privacy features along with a use case of CYBEX-P providing Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). We further introduce TAHOE& TDQL as better alternatives to existing CTLs and formulate ThreatRank - an algorithm to detect new malicious even",

Firstly, we prove global well-posedness and scattering of Dirac equations with Hartree-type nonlinearity for $b>0$ for small $L^2_x$-data with additional angular regularity. We also show that only small amount of angular regularity is required to obtain global existence of solutions.

Many different agents with various approaches have been employed over the competition's lifetime to solve this task. Even though the performance of these agents has increased significantly over the past few years, they still show major drawbacks in playing deceptive levels. This is because most of the current agents try to identify the best next shot rather than planning an effective sequence of shots. In order to encourage advancements in such agents, we present an automated methodology to generate deceptive game levels for Angry Birds. Even though there are many existing content generators for Angry Birds, they do not focus on generating deceptive levels. In this paper, we propose a procedure to generate deceptive levels for six deception categories that can fool the state-of-the-art Angry Birds playing AI agents. Our results show that generated deceptive levels exhibit similar characteristics of human-created deceptive levels. Additionally, we define metrics to measure the stability, solvability, and degree of deception of the generated levels.",

The radiative heating/cooling and the bulge stellar potential in galaxies are taken into account. We analyze the effect of accretion rate, luminosity, gas temperature, and Compton temperature on steady solutions of dynamical and thermal properties. The steady solutions are obviously different from Bondi solution. Compared to our models, the Bondi model underestimates the accretion rate. We give the boundary between thermal stability and instability. The boundary is significantly affected by Compton temperature. When Compton temperature is higher, the falling gases easily thermally unstable. When thermal instability takes place in the irradiated gases, the gases become two phases (i.e. hot gases and cool gases) and the hot gases may become outflows. This effect may reduce the accretion rates.",

The studies on gravitational waves induced by primordial curvature perturbations are of great interest. The aim of this paper is to investigate the third order induced gravitational waves. Based on the theory of cosmological perturbations, the first order scalar induces the second order scalar, vector and tensor perturbations. At the next iteration, the first order scalar, the second order scalar, vector and tensor perturbations all induce the third order tensor perturbations. We present the energy density spectrum of the third order gravitational waves for a monochromatic primordial power spectrum. The shape of the energy density spectrum of the third order gravitational waves is different from that of the second order scalar induced gravitational waves. And it is found that the third order gravitational waves sourced by the second order scalar perturbations dominate the energy density spectrum.",

When restricting labels $x_i$ to binary values, the problem is NP-hard. While a conventional semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation can be solved in polynomial time using, for example, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), the complexity of iteratively projecting a candidate matrix $M$ onto the positive semi-definite (PSD) cone ($M \\succeq 0$) remains high. In this paper, leveraging a recent linear algebraic theory called Gershgorin disc perfect alignment (GDPA), we propose a fast projection-free method by solving a sequence of linear programs (LP) instead. Specifically, we first recast the SDP relaxation to its SDP dual, where a feasible solution $H \\succeq 0$ can be interpreted as a Laplacian matrix corresponding to a balanced signed graph sans the last node. To achieve graph balance, we split the last node into two that respectively contain the original positive and negative edges, resulting in a new Laplacian $\\bar{H}$. We repose the SDP dual for solution $\\bar{H}$, then replace the PSD cone constraint $\\bar{H} \\succeq 0$ with linear constraints derived from GDPA -- sufficient conditions to ensure $\\bar{H}$ is PSD -- so that the optimization becomes an LP per iteration. Finally, we extract predicted labels from our converged LP solution $\\bar{H}$. Experiments show that our algorithm enjoyed a $40\\times$ speedup on average over the next fastest scheme while retaining comparable label prediction performance.",

To apply our theories to image coding, we propose the 3-D EMR which can better model an image in smaller blocks compared with the conventional Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR). The regressions are all based on our improved Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with mean square error optimization. Finally, we design an Adaptive Mode Selection (AMS) algorithm to realize the best model pattern combination for coding. Our recovered image has clear outlines and superior coding efficiency compared to JPEG below 0.25bpp. Our work realizes an unprecedented theory application by: (1) enriching the theory of Epanechnikov kernel,(2) improving the EM algorithm using MSE optimization, (3) exploiting the EMR and its application in image coding, and (4) AMS optimal modeling combined with Gaussian and Epanechnikov kernel.",

We find that coalescing droplets have a negligible effect on the drag, whereas the non-coalescing ones steadily increase drag as the volume fraction of the dispersed phase increases: indeed, at 10\\% volume fraction, the non-coalescing droplets show a 30\\% increase in drag, whereas the coalescing droplets show less than 4\\% increase. We explain this by looking at the wall-normal location of droplets in the channel and show that non-coalescing droplets enter the viscous sublayer, generating an interfacial shear stress which reduces the budget for viscous stress in the channel. On the other hand, coalescing droplets migrate towards the bulk of the channel forming large aggregates, which hardly affect the viscous shear stress while damping the Reynolds shear stress. We prove this by relating the mean viscous shear stress integrated in the wall-normal direction to the centreline velocity.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses a new variant of the multi-trip single vehicle routing problem where the nodes are related to each other through AND-type precedence constraints. The problem aims at determining a sequence of trips to visit all the nodes respecting every precedence constraint within and among the routes so to minimize the total traveling cost. Our motivation comes from routing problems where a node may have a set of predecessors (not just single one proposed in the dial-a-ride or pickup and delivery problems) resulting in a set of pairwise relations that specify which customers need to be visited before which other ones. We develop three Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) models to formulate the problem. The models are experimentally compared to determine the best one. Moreover, a solution approach based on the Logic-Based Benders Decomposition (LBBD) algorithm is developed which allows to decompose the original problem into an assignment master problem and independent sequencing subproblems. A new valid optimality cut is devised to achieve faster convergence. The cut performance is experimentally investigated by comparing with a recently proposed one in the literature. We further relax the algorithm to find the sub-optimal solution and demonstrate its efficiency. Extensive computational experiments are conducted to assess the proposed algorithms in terms of solution quality and CPU time.",

Unfortunately, the existing NLP-related augmentation methods cannot directly produce the available data required for this task. To solve the data lacking problem, we introduce a new approach to augment training data for event causality identification, by iteratively generating new examples and classifying event causality in a dual learning framework. On the one hand, our approach is knowledge-guided, which can leverage existing knowledge bases to generate well-formed new sentences. On the other hand, our approach employs a dual mechanism, which is a learnable augmentation framework and can interactively adjust the generation process to generate task-related sentences. Experimental results on two benchmarks EventStoryLine and Causal-TimeBank show that 1) our method can augment suitable task-related training data for ECI; 2) our method outperforms previous methods on EventStoryLine and Causal-TimeBank (+2.5 and +2.1 points on F1 value respectively).",

However, due to the overwhelming variety of tasks these robots will be expected to complete, providing generic out-of-the-box solutions that meet the needs of every possible user is clearly intractable. To address this problem, robots must therefore not only be capable of learning how to complete novel tasks at run-time, but the solutions to these tasks must also be informed by the needs of the user. In this paper we demonstrate how behaviour trees, a well established control architecture in the fields of gaming and robotics, can be used in conjunction with natural language instruction to provide a robust and modular control architecture for instructing autonomous agents to learn and perform novel complex tasks. We also show how behaviour trees generated using our approach can be generalised to novel scenarios, and can be re-used in future learning episodes to create increasingly complex behaviours. We validate this work against an existing corpus of natural language instructions, demonstrate the application of our approach on both a simulated robot solving a toy problem, as well as two distinct real-world robot platforms which, respectively, complete a block sorting scenario, and a patrol scenario.",

Its energetic event is manifested as the vertical gas features in its central molecular zone, for which stellar feedback was proposed as the driving engine. In order to pursue details of the activity, we have undertaken a kinematic analysis of the ALMA archive data of CO($J$=3--2) emission at the highest resolution $\\sim$3 pc. We revealed that one of the non-rotating gas components in the central molecular zone shows a loop-like distribution of $\\sim$200 pc radius. The loop is associated with a star cluster, whereas the cluster is not inside the loop and is not likely as the driver of the loop formation. Further, we find that the bar potential of NGC 253 seems to be too weak to drive the gas motion by the eccentric orbit. As an alternative we frame a scenario that magnetic acceleration by the Parker instability is responsible for the creation of the loop. We show that the observed loop properties are similar to those in the Milky Way, and argue that recent magnetro-hydrodynamics simulations lend support for the picture having the magnetic field strength of $\\gtrsim$100 $\\mu$G. We suggest that cluster formation was triggered by the falling gas to the footpoint of the loop, which is consistent with a typical dynamical timescale of the loop $\\sim$1 Myr.",

To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel approach, shortly named CauSeRL, which leverages external causal statements for event causality identification. First of all, we design a self-supervised framework to learn context-specific causal patterns from external causal statements. Then, we adopt a contrastive transfer strategy to incorporate the learned context-specific causal patterns into the target ECI model.

Its side effect is that a method that works for one variant is often ineffective for or not even applicable to another, which has prevented practical applications. In this paper, we give a general representation of UDA problems, named Generalized Domain Adaptation (GDA). GDA covers the major variants as special cases, which allows us to organize them in a comprehensive framework. Moreover, this generalization leads to a new challenging setting where existing methods fail, such as when domain labels are unknown, and class labels are only partially given to each domain. We propose a novel approach to the new setting. The key to our approach is self-supervised class-destructive learning, which enables the learning of class-invariant representations and domain-adversarial classifiers without using any domain labels. Extensive experiments using three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art UDA methods in the new setting and that it is competitive in existing UDA variations as well.",

It is challenging but crucial to develop highly conductive doped a-Si:H for minimizing the FF losses. Here we report intensive light soaking can efficiently boost the dark conductance of B-doped a-Si:H \"thin\" films, which is an abnormal Staebler-Wronski effect. By implementing this abnormal effect to SHJ solar cells, we achieve a certificated power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.18% (26.05% on designated area) with FF of 85.42% on a 244.63-cm2 wafer.

One possible way to execute more realistic algorithms in near-term quantum devices is to employ dynamic quantum circuits, in which measurements can happen during the circuit and their outcomes are used to control other parts of the circuit. This technique can help to significantly reduce the resources required to achieve a given accuracy of a quantum algorithm. However, since this type of quantum circuits are more flexible, their verification is much more challenging. In this paper, we give a formal definition of dynamic quantum circuits and then propose to characterise their functionality in terms of ensembles of linear operators. Based on this novel semantics, two dynamic quantum circuits are equivalent if they have the same functionality. We further propose and implement two decision diagram-based algorithms for checking the equivalence of dynamic quantum circuits.

        "abstract": "Jets and outflows are thought to play important roles in regulating star formation and disk evolution. HD 163296 is a well-studied Herbig Ae star that hosts proto-planet candidates, a protoplanetary disk, a protostellar jet, and a molecular outflow, which makes it an excellent laboratory for studying jets. We aim to characterize the jet at the inner regions and check if there are large differences with the features at large separations. A secondary objective is to demonstrate the performance of Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) in high-contrast imaging of extended line emission. MUSE in the narrow field mode (NFM) can provide observations at optical wavelengths with high spatial ($\\sim$75 mas) and medium spectral ($R\\sim$2500) resolution. With the high-resolution spectral differential imaging (HRSDI) technique, we can characterize the kinematic structures and physical conditions of jets down to 100 mas. We detect multiple atomic lines in two new knots, B3 and A4, at distances of <4\" from the host star with MUSE. The derived $\\dot{M}_{\\rm jet} / \\dot{M}_{\\rm acc}$ is about 0.08 and 0.06 for knots B3 and A4, respectively. The observed [Ca II]/[S II] ratios indicate that there is no sign of dust grains at distances of <4\". Assuming the knot A4 traces the streamline, we set an upper limit of 2.2 au on the size of the launching region. Although MUSE has the ability to detect the velocity shifts caused by high- and low-velocity components, we found no significant evidence of velocity decrease transverse to the jet direction. Our work demonstrates the capability of using MUSE NFM observations for the detailed study of stellar jets in the optical down to 100~mas. The derived $\\dot{M}_{\\rm jet} / \\dot{M}_{\\rm acc}$, no dust grain, and jet radius at the star support the magneto-centrifugal models as a launching mechanism for the jet.",

In higher dimensions heat transport can be unlocked by tuning filling fractions across a percolation transition for suitable lattice geometries. Transport in percolation clusters is additionally affected by effective bulk disorder and edge scattering induced by the local constraints, which work in favor of arresting the heat flow.

Many models have been proposed in the literature to estimate the permeability from properties of the porous media such as porosity, grain size or pore size. In this study, we develop a model of the permeability for porous media saturated by one or two fluid phases with all physically-based parameters using a fractal upscaling technique. The model is related to microstructural properties of porous media such as fractal dimension for pore space, fractal dimension for tortuosity, porosity, maximum radius, ratio of minimum pore radius and maximum pore radius, water saturation and irreducible water saturation. The model is favorably compared to existing and widely used models from the literature. Then, comparison with published experimental data for both unconsolidated and consolidated samples, we show that the proposed model estimate the permeability from the medium properties very well.",

        "abstract": "SUMMARY Geophysical imaging using the inversion procedure is a powerful tool for the exploration of the Earth's subsurface. However, the interpretation of inverted images can sometimes be difficult, due to the inherent limitations of existing inversion algorithms, which produce smoothed sections. In order to improve and automate the processing and interpretation of inverted geophysical models, we propose an approach inspired from data mining. We selected an algorithm known as DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) to perform clustering of inverted geophysical sections. The methodology relies on the automatic sorting and clustering of data. DBSCAN detects clusters in the inverted electrical resistivity values, with no prior knowledge of the number of clusters. This algorithm has the advantage of being defined by only two parameters: the neighbourhood of a point in the data space, and the minimum number of data points in this neighbourhood. We propose an objective procedure for the determination of these two parameters. The proof of concept described here is applied to simulated ERT (electrical resistivity tomography) sections, for the following three cases: two layers with a step, two layers with a rebound, and two layers with an anomaly embedded in the upper layer. To validate this approach, sensitivity studies were carried out on both of the above parameters, as well as to assess the influence of noise on the algorithm's performance. Finally, this methodology was tested on real field data. DBSCAN detects clusters in the inverted electrical resistivity models, and the former are then associated with various types of earth materials, thus allowing the structure of the prospected area to be determined. The proposed data-mining algorithm is shown to be effective, and to improve the interpretation of the inverted ERT sections. This new approach has considerable potential, as it can be applied to any geophysical data represented in the form of sections or maps.",

However, it remains challenging to carry the well-trained deep models for online real-time inference serving, with respect to the time-varying web-scale traffics from billions of users, in a cost-effective manner. In this work, we present JIZHI - a Model-as-a-Service system - that per second handles hundreds of millions of online inference requests to huge deep models with more than trillions of sparse parameters, for over twenty real-time recommendation services at Baidu, Inc. In JIZHI, the inference workflow of every recommendation request is transformed to a Staged Event-Driven Pipeline (SEDP), where each node in the pipeline refers to a staged computation or I/O intensive task processor. With traffics of real-time inference requests arrived, each modularized processor can be run in a fully asynchronized way and managed separately. Besides, JIZHI introduces heterogeneous and hierarchical storage to further accelerate the online inference process by reducing unnecessary computations and potential data access latency induced by ultra-sparse model parameters. Moreover, an intelligent resource manager has been deployed to maximize the throughput of JIZHI over the shared infrastructure by searching the optimal resource allocation plan from historical logs and fine-tuning the load shedding policies over intermediate system feedback. Extensive experiments have been done to demonstrate the advantages of JIZHI from the perspectives of end-to-end service latency, system-wide throughput, and resource consumption. JIZHI has helped Baidu saved more than ten million US dollars in hardware and utility costs while handling 200% more traffics without sacrificing inference efficiency.",

The propagation of information in graphs is important in learning dynamic graph representations, and most of the existing methods achieve this by aggregation. However, relying only on aggregation to propagate information in dynamic graphs can result in delays in information propagation and thus affect the performance of the method. To alleviate this problem, we propose an aggregation-diffusion (AD) mechanism that actively propagates information to its neighbor by diffusion after the node updates its embedding through the aggregation mechanism. In experiments on two real-world datasets in the dynamic link prediction task, the AD mechanism outperforms the baseline models that only use aggregation to propagate information. We further conduct extensive experiments to discuss the influence of different factors in the AD mechanism.",

Because of this the abundances of $^{92,94}\\mathrm{Mo}$ and $^{96,98}\\mathrm{Ru}$ in the Galaxy are significantly enhanced at [Fe/H]=0 by the $\\nu p$-process. We find that the $\\nu p$-process in hypernovae is the main contributor to the elemental abundance of $^{92}$Mo at low metallicity [Fe/H$]<-2$. Our theoretical prediction of the elemental abundances in metal-poor stars becomes more consistent with observational data when the $\\nu p$-process in hypernovae is taken into account.",

CGS systematically computes the fixed points of a target graph system and decodes them to estimate the stationary properties of the system without the prior knowledge of existing solvers or intermediate solutions. The forward propagation of CGS proceeds in three steps: (1) constructing the input dependent linear contracting iterative maps, (2) computing the fixed-points of the linear maps, and (3) decoding the fixed-points to estimate the properties. The contractivity of the constructed linear maps guarantees the existence and uniqueness of the fixed points following the Banach fixed point theorem. To train CGS efficiently, we also derive a tractable analytical expression for its gradient by leveraging the implicit function theorem. We evaluate the performance of CGS by applying it to various network-analytic and graph benchmark problems. The results indicate that CGS has competitive capabilities for predicting the stationary properties of graph systems, irrespective of whether the target systems are linear or non-linear. CGS also shows high performance for graph classification problems where the existence or the meaning of a fixed point is hard to be clearly defined, which highlights the potential of CGS as a general graph neural network architecture.",

        "abstract": "Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) are hugely popular for solving tabular data problems. However, practitioners are not only interested in point predictions, but also in probabilistic predictions in order to quantify the uncertainty of the predictions. Creating such probabilistic predictions is difficult with existing GBM-based solutions: they either require training multiple models or they become too computationally expensive to be useful for large-scale settings. We propose Probabilistic Gradient Boosting Machines (PGBM), a method to create probabilistic predictions with a single ensemble of decision trees in a computationally efficient manner. PGBM approximates the leaf weights in a decision tree as a random variable, and approximates the mean and variance of each sample in a dataset via stochastic tree ensemble update equations. These learned moments allow us to subsequently sample from a specified distribution after training. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of PGBM compared to existing state-of-the-art methods: (i) PGBM enables probabilistic estimates without compromising on point performance in a single model, (ii) PGBM learns probabilistic estimates via a single model only (and without requiring multi-parameter boosting), and thereby offers a speedup of up to several orders of magnitude over existing state-of-the-art methods on large datasets, and (iii) PGBM achieves accurate probabilistic estimates in tasks with complex differentiable loss functions, such as hierarchical time series problems, where we observed up to 10% improvement in point forecasting performance and up to 300% improvement in probabilistic forecasting performance.",

The neurons have time constants, which mean that the integrated network structure has state memory. The network structure contains complex mutual interactions between the neurons under different conditions, which depend on the internal state of the network. The internal state can be defined as the distribution of activity across all individual neurons across the network. Therefore, the state of a neuron/network becomes a defining factor for how information is represented within the network. Towards this study, we constructed a fully connected (with dense/sparse coding strategies) recurrent network comprising of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, driven by pseudo-random inputs of varying frequencies. In this study we assessed the impact of varying specific intrinsic parameters of the neurons that enriched network state dynamics, such as initial neuron activity, amount of inhibition in combination with thresholded neurons and conduction delays. The impact was assessed by quantifying the changes in mutual interactions between the neurons within the network for each given input. We found such effects were more profound in sparsely connected networks than in densely connected networks. However, also densely connected networks could make use of such dynamic changes in the mutual interactions between neurons, as a given input could induce multiple different network states.",

The subtlety of emotional fluctuations can be examined through perturbation in conversations or speech. Analysis of emotional state of a person from acoustical features of speech signal leads to discovery of vital cues determining his or her mental health. Hence, it's an important field of research in the area of Human Computer Interaction(HCI). In a recent work we have shown that how the contrast in Hurst-Exponent calculated from the non-stationary and nonlinear aspects of \"angry\" and \"sad\" speech(spoken in English language) recordings in the Toronto-Emotional-Speech-Set(TESS) can be used for early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease. In this work we have extended the work and extracted Hurst-exponent for the speech-signals of similar emotions but spoken in German language. It has been observed that the Hurst-exponent efficiently segregates the contrasting emotions of \"anger\" and \"sadness\" in the speech spoken in German language, in similar fashion it has been doing for English speech. Hence it can be concluded that the Hurst-exponent can differentiate among speech spoken out of different emotions in language-independent manner. We propose algorithm for a language-independent application for early non-invasive detection of various severe neurocognitive-disorders like Alzheimer's Disease, MND(motor-neuron-disorder), ASD(autism-spectrum-disorder), depression, suicidal-tendency etc. which is not possible with the state of the art medical science.",

In this paper, we introduce an approach to implementing and deploying the conceptual graph at Alibaba. Specifically, We propose a framework called AliCG which is capable of a) extracting fine-grained concepts by a novel bootstrapping with alignment consensus approach, b) mining long-tail concepts with a novel low-resource phrase mining approach, c) updating the graph dynamically via a concept distribution estimation method based on implicit and explicit user behaviors. We have deployed the framework at Alibaba UC Browser. Extensive offline evaluation as well as online A/B testing demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.",

The feature of RapidXMM is speed. It enables the fast retrieval of X-ray upper limits and photometry products in three energy bands (0.2-2, 2-12, 0.2-12 keV) for large numbers of input sky positions. This is accomplished using the Hierarchical Equal Area Iso Latitude pixelation of the sphere (HEALPix). The pre-calculated upper-limits and associated X-ray photometry products are reprojected into the HEALPix grid of cells before being ingested into the RapidXMM database. This results in tables of upper limits and aperture photometry within HEALPix cells of size ~3 arcsec (Pointed Observations) and ~6 arcsec (Slew Survey). The database tables are indexed by the unique integer number of the HEALPix cells. This reduces spatial nearest-neighbor queries by sky position to an integer-matching exercise and significantly accelerates the retrieval of results. We describe in detail the processing steps that lead from the science products available in the XMM-Newton archive to a database optimised for sky queries. We also present two simple show-case applications of RapidXMM for scientific studies: searching for variable X-ray sources, and stacking analysis of X-ray faint populations",

Reading preprints is one of the effective ways to do this. By having journal clubs where people can read and discuss journals together, the benefits of reading journals become more prevalent. We present an investigative study of understanding the factors that affect the success of preprint journal clubs in astronomy, more commonly known as Astro-ph/Astro-Coffee (hereafter called AC). A survey was disseminated to understand how institutions from different countries implement AC. We interviewed 9 survey respondents and from their responses we identified four important factors that make AC successful: commitment (how the organizer and attendees participate in AC), environment (how conducive and comfortable AC is conducted), content (the discussed topics in AC and how they are presented), and objective (the main goal/s of conducting AC). We also present the format of our AC, an elective class which was evaluated during the Spring Semester 2020 (March 2020 - June 2020). Our evaluation with the attendees showed that enrollees (those who are enrolled and are required to present papers regularly) tend to be more committed in attending compared to audiences (those who are not enrolled and are not required to present papers regularly). In addition, participants tend to find papers outside their research field harder to read. Finally, we showed an improvement in the weekly number of papers read after attending AC of those who present papers regularly, and a high satisfaction rating of our AC. We summarize the areas of improvement in our AC implementation, and we encourage other institutions to evaluate their own AC in accordance with the four aforementioned factors to assess the effectiveness of their AC in reaching their goals.",

This is bringing to light cross-domain issues that are yet to be addressed in this context. Indeed, the information extracted from learned representations suffers from an intrinsic environmental bias. This strongly affects the ability to generalize to unseen scenarios, limiting the application of current methods in real settings where trimmed labeled data are not available during training. In this work, we propose to leverage over the intrinsic complementary nature of audio-visual signals to learn a representation that works well on data seen during training, while being able to generalize across different domains. To this end, we introduce an audio-visual loss that aligns the contributions from the two modalities by acting on the magnitude of their feature norm representations. This new loss, plugged into a minimal multi-modal action recognition architecture, leads to strong results in cross-domain first person action recognition, as demonstrated by extensive experiments on the popular EPIC-Kitchens dataset.",

        "abstract": "We define a generalised model for three-stranded DNA consisting of two chains of one type and a third chain of a different type. The DNA strands are modelled by random walks on the three-dimensional cubic lattice with different interactions between two chains of the same type and two chains of different types. This model may be thought of as a classical analogue of the quantum three-body problem. In the quantum situation it is known that three identical quantum particles will form a triplet with an infinite tower of bound states at the point where any pair of particles would have zero binding energy. The phase diagram is mapped out, and the different phase transitions examined using finite-size scaling. We look particularly at the scaling of the DNA model at the equivalent Efimov point for chains up to 10000 steps in length. We find clear evidence of several bound states in the finite-size scaling. We compare these states with the expected Efimov behaviour.",

For isotropic scattering in cylindrically or rotationally symmetric systems with in-plane scattering, the scattered light distribution can be expressed as a convolution between a scattering function, which characterises the optical properties of the surface, and a specular light distribution. Deconvolving this expression allows for traditional specular reflector design procedures to be used, whilst accounting for scattering.",

Current methods to analyze feedback strength, however, do not take such state dependency into account; they only consider changes in (global mean) temperature and assume all feedbacks are linearly related to that. This makes (transient) changes in feedback strengths almost intangible and generally leads to underestimation of future warming. Here, we present a multivariate (and spatially explicit) framework that facilitates dissection of climate feedbacks over time scales. Using this framework, information on the composition of projected (transient) future climates and feedback strengths can be obtained. Moreover, it can be used to make projections for many emission scenarios through linear response theory. The new framework is illustrated using the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2).",

In light of these differences, we explore here, using a citation network analysis and assessment of normalised citation impact of \"duplicate\" publications, whether the three databases offer structurally different perspectives of the bibliometric landscape or if they are essentially homogenous substitutes. Our citation network analysis of core and exclusive 2016-2018 publications revealed a large set of core publications indexed in all three databases that are highly self-referential. In comparison, each database selected a set of exclusive publications that appeared to hold similarly low levels of relevance to the core set and to one another, with slightly more internal communication between exclusive publications in Scopus and Dimensions than WoS. Our comparison of normalised citations for 41,848 publications indexed in all three databases found that German sectors were valuated as more impactful in Scopus and Dimensions compared to WoS, particularly for sectors with an applied research focus. We conclude that the databases do present structurally different perspectives, although Scopus and Dimensions with their additional circle of applied research vary more from the more base research-focused WoS than they do from one another.",

While several young SNRs (including Tycho's SNR) were previously found to show peculiar X-ray structures with flux variations in one- or several-year timescales, such an event at $\\gamma$-ray energies is for the first time seen. The hard $\\gamma$-ray emission and year-long timescale of the event necessitate a synchrotron radiation process, although the required conditions are either ultra-high energies for the electrons in the process, upto $\\sim$10 PeV (well above the cosmic-ray \"knee\" energy), or high inhomogeneity of the magnetic field in the SNR. This event in Tycho's SNR is likely analogous to the $\\gamma$-ray flares observed in the Crab nebula, the comparably short timescales of them both requiring a synchrotron process, and similar magnetohydrodynamic processes such as magnetic reconnection would be at work as well in the SNR to accelerate particles to ultra-relativistic energies. The event and its implications thus reveal the more complicated side of the physical processes that can occur in young SNRs.",

We used lateral view knee radiographs from MOST public use datasets (n = 5507 knees). Patellar region-of-interest (ROI) was automatically detected using landmark detection tool (BoneFinder). Hand-crafted features, based on LocalBinary Patterns (LBP), were then extracted to describe the patellar texture. First, a machine learning model (Gradient Boosting Machine) was trained to detect radiographic PFOA from the LBP features. Furthermore, we used end-to-end trained deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) directly on the texture patches for detecting the PFOA. The proposed classification models were eventually compared with more conventional reference models that use clinical assessments and participant characteristics such as age, sex, body mass index(BMI), the total WOMAC score, and tibiofemoral Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade. Atlas-guided visual assessment of PFOA status by expert readers provided in the MOST public use datasets was used as a classification outcome for the models. Performance of prediction models was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC), the area under the precision-recall (PR) curve-average precision (AP)-, and Brier score in the stratified 5-fold cross validation setting.Of the 5507 knees, 953 (17.3%) had PFOA. AUC and AP for the strongest reference model including age, sex, BMI, WOMAC score, and tibiofemoral KL grade to predict PFOA were 0.817 and 0.487, respectively. Textural ROI classification using CNN significantly improved the prediction performance (ROC AUC= 0.889, AP= 0.714). We present the first study that analyses patellar bone texture for diagnosing PFOA. Our results demonstrates the potential of using texture features of patella to predict PFOA.",

However, the lack of corpora is a main obstacle to this research, particularly in Chinese language. In this paper, we propose PsyQA, a Chinese dataset of psychological health support in the form of question and answer pair. PsyQA is crawled from a Chinese mental health service platform, and contains 22K questions and 56K long and well-structured answers. Based on the psychological counseling theories, we annotate a portion of answer texts with typical strategies for providing support, and further present in-depth analysis of both lexical features and strategy patterns in the counseling answers. We also evaluate the performance of generating counseling answers with the generative pretrained models. Results show that utilizing strategies enhances the fluency and helpfulness of generated answers, but there is still a large space for future research.",

Therefore, the research community is actively working on developing approaches to detect whether a given text is organic or synthetic. While this is a useful first step, it is important to be able to further fingerprint the author LM to attribute its origin. Prior work on fingerprinting LMs is limited to attributing synthetic text generated by a handful (usually < 10) of pre-trained LMs. However, LMs such as GPT2 are commonly fine-tuned in a myriad of ways (e.g., on a domain-specific text corpus) before being used to generate synthetic text. It is challenging to fingerprinting fine-tuned LMs because the universe of fine-tuned LMs is much larger in realistic scenarios. To address this challenge, we study the problem of large-scale fingerprinting of fine-tuned LMs in the wild. Using a real-world dataset of synthetic text generated by 108 different fine-tuned LMs, we conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the limitations of existing fingerprinting approaches. Our results show that fine-tuning itself is the most effective in attributing the synthetic text generated by fine-tuned LMs.",

Affective computing, as an interdisciplinary research field, linking artificial intelligence to cognitive inference, is capable to exploit emotion-oriented knowledge from brief contents. The textual contents convey hidden information such as personality and cognition about corresponding authors that can determine both correlations and variations between users. Emotion recognition from brief contents should embrace the contrast between authors where the differences in personality and cognition can be traced within emotional expressions. To tackle this challenge, we devise a framework that, on the one hand, infers latent individual aspects, from brief contents and, on the other hand, presents a novel ensemble classifier equipped with dynamic dropout convnets to extract emotions from textual context. To categorize short text contents, our proposed method conjointly leverages cognitive factors and exploits hidden information. We utilize the outcome vectors in a novel embedding model to foster emotion-pertinent features that are collectively assembled by lexicon inductions. Experimental results show that compared to other competitors, our proposed model can achieve a higher performance in recognizing emotion from noisy contents.",

        "abstract": "Incomplete instances with various missing attributes in many real-world scenes have brought challenges to the classification task. There are some missing values imputation methods to fill the missing values with substitute values before classification. However, the separation between imputation and classification may lead to inferior performance since label information are ignored during imputation. Moreover, these imputation methods tend to initialize these missing values with strong prior assumptions, while the unreliability of such initialization is rarely considered. To tackle these problems, a novel semi-supervised conditional normalizing flow (SSCFlow) is proposed in this paper. SSCFlow explicitly utilizes the observed labels to facilitate the imputation and classification simultaneously by employing a semi-supervised algorithm to estimate the conditional probability density of missing values. Moreover, SSCFlow takes the initialized missing values as corrupted initial imputation and iteratively reconstructs their latent representations with an overcomplete denoising autoencoder to approximate the true conditional probability density of missing values. Experiments have been conducted with real-world datasets to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",

The choice of the Go language is motivated by the fact that concurrency is a first-class citizen in Go, and it is widely used in Go programs. GOCC performs rich inter-procedural program analysis to detect and filter lock-protected regions and performs AST-level code transformation of the surrounding locks when profitable. Profitability is driven by both static analyses of critical sections and dynamic analysis via execution profiles. A custom HTM library, using perceptron, learns concurrency behavior and dynamically decides whether to use HTM in the rewritten lock/unlock points. Given the rich history of transactional memory research but its lack of adoption in any industrial setting, we believe this workflow, which ultimately produces source-code patches, is more apt for industry-scale adoption. Results on widely adopted Go libraries and applications demonstrate significant (up to 10x) and scalable performance gains resulting from our automated transformation while avoiding major performance regressions.",

We trained an edge-gated Graph Convolutional Network (Gated-GCN) to accurately predict the risk of distant metastasis (DM) by propagating information across the LN graph with the aid of soft edge attention mechanism. In a cohort of 1570 head and neck cancer patients, the Gated-GCN achieves AUROC of 0.757 for 2-year DM classification and $C$-index of 0.725 for lifetime DM risk prediction, outperforming current prognostic factors as well as previous approaches based on aggregated LN features.

Our methods rely on a basis transformation into blocks of constrained versus non-constrained subspaces, and we show that the methods greatly outperform existing alternatives in terms of computational cost. By combining the proposed methods with the stochastic partial differential equation approach for Gaussian random fields, we also show how to formulate Gaussian process regression with linear constraints in a GMRF setting to reduce computational cost.

        "abstract": "Active learning methods have recently surged in the literature due to their ability to solve complex structural reliability problems within an affordable computational cost. These methods are designed by adaptively building an inexpensive surrogate of the original limit-state function. Examples of such surrogates include Gaussian process models which have been adopted in many contributions, the most popular ones being the efficient global reliability analysis (EGRA) and the active Kriging Monte Carlo simulation (AK-MCS), two milestone contributions in the field. In this paper, we first conduct a survey of the recent literature, showing that most of the proposed methods actually span from modifying one or more aspects of the two aforementioned methods. We then propose a generalized modular framework to build on-the-fly efficient active learning strategies by combining the following four ingredients or modules: surrogate model, reliability estimation algorithm, learning function and stopping criterion. Using this framework, we devise 39 strategies for the solution of 20 reliability benchmark problems. The results of this extensive benchmark are analyzed under various criteria leading to a synthesized set of recommendations for practitioners. These may be refined with a priori knowledge about the feature of the problem to solve, i.e., dimensionality and magnitude of the failure probability. This benchmark has eventually highlighted the importance of using surrogates in conjunction with sophisticated reliability estimation algorithms as a way to enhance the efficiency of the latter.",

        "abstract": "Unlike the conventional wisdom in statistical learning theory, the test error of a deep neural network (DNN) often demonstrates double descent: as the model complexity increases, it first follows a classical U-shaped curve and then shows a second descent. Through bias-variance decomposition, recent studies revealed that the bell-shaped variance is the major cause of model-wise double descent (when the DNN is widened gradually). This paper investigates epoch-wise double descent, i.e., the test error of a DNN also shows double descent as the number of training epoches increases. By extending the bias-variance analysis to epoch-wise double descent of the zero-one loss, we surprisingly find that the variance itself, without the bias, varies consistently with the test error. Inspired by this result, we propose a novel metric, optimization variance (OV), to measure the diversity of model updates caused by the stochastic gradients of random training batches drawn in the same iteration. OV can be estimated using samples from the training set only but correlates well with the (unknown) \\emph{test} error, and hence early stopping may be achieved without using a validation set.",

We show both numerically and conceptually that the associated eigenvectors are obtained by a simple arithmetic operation of finite sum using prolate spheroidal wave functions associated to the scale S. Then we use these functions to condition the canonical spectral triple of the circle of length L=2 Log(S) in such a way that they belong to the kernel of the perturbed Dirac operator. We give numerical evidence that, when one varies L, the low lying spectrum of the perturbed spectral triple resembles the low lying zeros of the Riemann zeta function. We justify conceptually this result and show that, for each eigenvalue, the coincidence is perfect for the special values of the length L of the circle for which the two natural ways of realizing the perturbation give the same eigenvalue. This fact is tested numerically by reproducing the first thirty one zeros of the Riemann zeta function from our spectral side, and estimate the probability of having obtained this agreement at random, as a very small number whose first fifty decimal places are all zero. The theoretical concept which emerges is that of zeta cycle and our main result establishes its relation with the critical zeros of the Riemann zeta function and with the spectral realization of these zeros obtained by the first author.",

High frequency measurements produce big data sets that present opportunities to conduct new analyses for improved understanding of water quality dynamics and more effective management of rivers and streams. Of primary importance is enhancing knowledge of the relationships between nitrate, one of the most reactive forms of inorganic nitrogen in the aquatic environment, and other water quality variables. We analysed high frequency water quality data from in situ sensors deployed in three sites from different watersheds and climate zones within the National Ecological Observatory Network, USA. We used generalised additive mixed models to explain the nonlinear relationships at each site between nitrate concentration and conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, and elevation. Temporal auto correlation was modelled with an auto regressive moving average model and we examined the relative importance of the explanatory variables. Total deviance explained by the models was high for all sites. Although variable importance and the smooth regression parameters differed among sites, the models explaining the most variation in nitrate contained the same explanatory variables. This study demonstrates that building a model for nitrate using the same set of explanatory water quality variables is achievable, even for sites with vastly different environmental and climatic characteristics. Applying such models will assist managers to select cost effective water quality variables to monitor when the goals are to gain a spatially and temporally in depth understanding of nitrate dynamics and adapt management plans accordingly.",

The curiosity gain of the information-rich area was proposed to provoke the robot to approach localization referenced landmarks.

This paper presents a framework, GMAIR, for unsupervised object detection. It incorporates spatial attention and a Gaussian mixture in a unified deep generative model. GMAIR can locate objects in a scene and simultaneously cluster them without supervision. Furthermore, we analyze the \"what\" latent variables and clustering process.

Our results are based on a new maximal inequality that carefully leverages the importance sampling structure to obtain rates with the right dependence on the exploration rate in the data. For regression, we provide fast rates that leverage the strong convexity of squared-error loss. For policy learning, we provide rate-optimal regret guarantees that close an open gap in the existing literature whenever exploration decays to zero, as is the case for bandit-collected data.

The system exhibits different density orders like the checkerboard and the striped pattern, depending upon the polarization angle of the dipoles. We quench the hopping parameter across the striped density wave (SDW) to striped supersolid (SSS) phase transition, and obtain the scaling laws for the correlation length and topological vortex density, as function of the quench rate. The results are reminiscent of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). We also investigate the dynamics from the striped supersolid phase to the checkerboard supersolid phase, obtained by quenching the dipole tilt angle $\\theta$. This is a first order structural quantum phase transition, and we study the non-equilibrium dynamics from the perspective of the KZM. In particular, we find the number of the domains with checkerboard order follows a power law scaling with the quench rate. This indicates the applicability of the KZM to this first order quantum phase transition.",

Using the UV luminosity data compilation from Hubble Frontiers Fields we reconstruct the redshift evolution of UV luminosity density and thereby the evolution of the source term in the ionization equation. This model-independent reconstruction rules out single power-law evolution of the luminosity density but supports the logarithmic double power-law parametrization. We obtain reionization history by integrating ionization equations with the reconstructed source term. Using optical depth constraint from Planck Cosmic Microwave Background observation, measurement of UV luminosity function integrated till truncation magnitude of -17 and -15, and derived ionization fraction from high redshift quasar, galaxies and gamma-ray burst observations, we constrain the history of reionization. In the conservative case we find the constraint on the optical depth as $\\tau =0.052\\pm0.001\\pm0.002$ at 68% and 95% confidence intervals. We find the redshift duration between 10% and 90% ionization to be $2.05_{-0.21-0.30}^{+0.11+0.37}$. Longer duration of reionization is supported if UV luminosity density data with truncation magnitude of -15 is used in the joint analysis. Our results point out that even in a conservative reconstruction, a combination of cosmological and astrophysical observations can provide stringent constraints on the epoch of reionization.",

        "abstract": "As autonomous machines such as robots and vehicles start performing tasks involving human users, ensuring a safe interaction between them becomes an important issue. Translating methods from human-robot interaction (HRI) studies to the interaction between humans and other highly complex machines (e.g. semi-autonomous vehicles) could help advance the use of those machines in scenarios requiring human interaction. One method involves understanding human intentions and decision-making to estimate the human's present and near-future actions whilst interacting with a robot. This idea originates from the psychological concept of Theory of Mind, which has been broadly explored for robotics and recently for autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. In this work, we explored how to predict human intentions before an action is performed by combining data from human-motion, vehicle-state and human inputs (e.g. steering wheel, pedals). A data-driven approach based on Recurrent Neural Network models was used to classify the current driving manoeuvre and to predict the future manoeuvre to be performed. A state-transition model was used with a fixed set of manoeuvres to label data recorded during the trials for real-time applications. Models were trained and tested using drivers of different seat preferences, driving expertise and arm-length; precision and recall metrics over 95% for manoeuvre identification and 86% for manoeuvre prediction were achieved, with prediction time-windows of up to 1 second for both known and unknown test subjects. Compared to our previous results, performance improved and manoeuvre prediction was possible for unknown test subjects without knowing the current manoeuvre.",

In this paper, we propose that as an angular momentum of phonons for a crystal without TRS, we need to consider the canonical angular momentum, as opposed to the kinetic angular momentum in previous works. Next, we show that the angular momentum of phonons without TRS exhibits universal behaviors near the $\\Gamma$ point. We focus on in-plane oscillations in two-dimensional crystals as an example. By breaking the TRS, one of the acoustic phonon branches at the $\\Gamma$ point acquires a gap. We show that the angular momentum of its acoustic phonon with a gap has a peak with the height $\\pm \\hbar$ regardless of the details of the system. From this, we find that this peak height changes discontinuously by changing the sign of the TRS-breaking parameter.",

For realizing micro-inverters single stage transformer-less topologies are preferred as they offer better power evacuation efficacy. A SEPIC-\u0106uk based transformer-less micro-inverter, having only one high frequency switch and four line frequency switches, is proposed in this paper. The proposed converter can be employed to interface a 35 V PV module to a 220 V single phase ac grid. As a very high gain is required to be achieved for the converter, it is made to operate in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) for all possible operating conditions. Since the ground of the each PV modules is connected to the ground of the utility, there is no possibility of leakage current flow between the module and the utility. Detailed simulation studies are carried out to ascertain the efficacy of the proposed micro-inverter. A laboratory prototype of the inverter is fabricated, and detailed experimental studies are carried out to confirm the viability of the proposed scheme.",

The new finite volume scheme has superior dispersion and dissipation properties in comparison to the compact reconstruction approach. These implicit gradients are re-used in viscous flux computation and post-processing, which further improves efficiency. A problem-independent shock capturing approach via Boundary Variation Diminishing (BVD) algorithm is used to suppress oscillations for the simulation of flows with shocks and material interfaces. Several numerical test cases are carried out to verify the proposed finite volume method's capability using the implicit gradient method for single and multicomponent flows. Significant improvements are observed by computing the gradients implicitly for the viscous flows.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a severe complication that may lead to retinal vascular damage and is one of the leading causes of vision impairment and blindness. DR broadly is classified into two stages - non-proliferative (NPDR), where there are almost no symptoms, except a few microaneurysms, and proliferative (PDR) involving a huge number of microaneurysms and hemorrhages, soft and hard exudates, neo-vascularization, macular ischemia or a combination of these, making it easier to detect. More specifically, DR is usually classified into five levels, labeled 0-4, from 0 indicating no DR to 4 which is most severe. This paper firstly presents a discussion on the risk factors of the disease, then surveys the recent literature on the topic followed by examining certain techniques which were found to be highly effective in improving the prognosis accuracy. Finally, a convolutional neural network model is proposed to detect all the stages of DR on a low-memory edge microcontroller. The model has a size of just 5.9 MB, accuracy and F1 score both of 94% and an inference speed of about 20 frames per second.",

        "abstract": "A long-standing challenge in artificial intelligence is lifelong learning. In lifelong learning, many tasks are presented in sequence and learners must efficiently transfer knowledge between tasks while avoiding catastrophic forgetting over long lifetimes. On these problems, policy reuse and other multi-policy reinforcement learning techniques can learn many tasks. However, they can generate many temporary or permanent policies, resulting in memory issues. Consequently, there is a need for lifetime-scalable methods that continually refine a policy library of a pre-defined size. This paper presents a first approach to lifetime-scalable policy reuse. To pre-select the number of policies, a notion of task capacity, the maximal number of tasks that a policy can accurately solve, is proposed. To evaluate lifetime policy reuse using this method, two state-of-the-art single-actor base-learners are compared: 1) a value-based reinforcement learner, Deep Q-Network (DQN) or Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN); and 2) an actor-critic reinforcement learner, Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) with or without Long Short-Term Memory layer. By selecting the number of policies based on task capacity, D(R)QN achieves near-optimal performance with 6 policies in a 27-task MDP domain and 9 policies in an 18-task POMDP domain; with fewer policies, catastrophic forgetting and negative transfer are observed. Due to slow, monotonic improvement, PPO requires fewer policies, 1 policy for the 27-task domain and 4 policies for the 18-task domain, but it learns the tasks with lower accuracy than D(R)QN. These findings validate lifetime-scalable policy reuse and suggest using D(R)QN for larger and PPO for smaller library sizes.",

Our main results are that the coefficient size of the scaled inverse of $(x^i-x^j)$ is bounded by $p-1$ with the scale $p$ modulo $\\Phi_{p^s}(x)$, and is bounded by $q-1$ with the scale not greater than $q$ modulo $\\Phi_{p^s q^t}(x)$. Previously, the analogous result on cyclotomic polynomials of the form $\\Phi_{2^n}(x)$ gave rise to many lattice-based cryptosystems, especially, zero-knowledge proofs. Our result provides more flexible choice of cyclotomic polynomials in such cryptosystems.

The aggregation is commonly done with sum or concatenation (concat) followed by convolutional (conv) layers. However, it fully passes down the high-level context to the following hierarchy without considering their interrelation. In this work, we aim to enable the low-level feature to aggregate the complementary context from adjacent high-level feature maps by a cross-scale pixel-to-region relation operation. We leverage cross-scale context propagation to make the long-range dependency capturable even by the high-resolution low-level features. To this end, we employ an efficient feature pyramid network to obtain multi-scale features. We propose a Relational Semantics Extractor (RSE) and Relational Semantics Propagator (RSP) for context extraction and propagation respectively. Then we stack several RSP into an RSP head to achieve the progressive top-down distribution of the context. Experiment results on two challenging datasets Cityscapes and COCO demonstrate that the RSP head performs competitively on both semantic segmentation and panoptic segmentation with high efficiency. It outperforms DeeplabV3 [1] by 0.7% with 75% fewer FLOPs (multiply-adds) in the semantic segmentation task.",

        "abstract": "Sunspots are known to be strong absorbers of solar oscillation modal power. The most convincing way to demonstrate this is done via Fourier-Hankel decomposition (FHD), where the local oscillation field is separated into in- and outgoing waves, showing the reduction in power. Due to the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager's high-cadence Doppler measurements, power absorption can be investigated at frequencies beyond the acoustic cutoff frequency. We perform an FHD on five sunspot regions and two quiet-Sun control regions and study the resulting absorption spectra $\\alpha_\\ell(\\nu)$, specifically at frequencies $\\nu$ > 5.3 mHz. We observe an unreported high-frequency absorption feature, which only appears in the presence of a sunspot. This feature is confined to phase speeds of one-skip waves whose origins coincide with the sunspot's center, with $v_{ph}$ = 85.7 km/s in this case. By employing a fit to the absorption spectra at a constant phase speed, we find that the peak absorption strength $\\alpha_{max}$ lies between 0.166 and 0.222 at a noise level of about 0.009 (5%). The well-known absorption along ridges at lower frequencies can reach up to $\\alpha_{max}\\approx$ 0.5. Thus our finding in the absorption spectrum is weaker, but nevertheless significant. From first considerations regarding the energy budget of high-frequency waves, this observation can likely be explained by the reduction of emissivity within the sunspot. We derive a simple relation between emissivity and absorption. We conclude that sunspots yield a wave power absorption signature (for certain phase speeds only), which may help in understanding the effect of strong magnetic fields on convection and source excitation and potentially in understanding the general sunspot subsurface structure.",

        "abstract": "Assessing the quality of parameter estimates for models describing the motion of single molecules in cellular environments is an important problem in fluorescence microscopy. We consider the fundamental data model, where molecules emit photons at random times and the photons arrive at random locations on the detector according to complex point spread functions (PSFs). The random, non-Gaussian PSF of the detection process and random trajectory of the molecule make inference challenging. Moreover, the presence of other nearby molecules causes further uncertainty in the origin of the measurements, which impacts the statistical precision of estimates. We quantify the limits of accuracy of model parameter estimates and separation distance between closely spaced molecules (known as the resolution problem) by computing the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB), or equivalently the inverse of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), for the variance of estimates. This fundamental CRLB is crucial, as it provides a lower bound for more practical scenarios. While analytic expressions for the FIM can be derived for static molecules, the analytical tools to evaluate it for molecules whose trajectories follow SDEs are still mostly missing. We address this by presenting a general SMC based methodology for both parameter inference and computing the desired accuracy limits for non-static molecules and a non-Gaussian fundamental detection model. For the first time, we are able to estimate the FIM for stochastically moving molecules observed through the Airy and Born & Wolf PSF. This is achieved by estimating the score and observed information matrix via SMC. We sum up the outcome of our numerical work by summarising the qualitative behaviours for the accuracy limits as functions of e.g. collected photon count, molecule diffusion, etc. We also verify that we can recover known results from the static molecule case.",

However, skyrmions do not move parallel to applied currents and typically do not coexist with other nano-objects, making the realization of such storage concepts difficult. Herein we consider materials with an anisotropic DMI, like tetragonal Heusler materials, and show that four distinct types of topologically trivial bubbles can coexist. We show that each of them can be written by spin torques and that they can be distinguished using a single magnetic tunneling junction. Due to their trivial topology, the four types of bubbles move parallel to applied electrical currents and remain equidistant under motion. Still, the bubbles have a small size and high stability comparable to topologically non-trivial spin textures. This allows to construct a quaternary-digit-based racetrack storage device that overcomes the two mentioned drawbacks of skyrmion-based racetracks.",

However, it is not straightforward to decide which influencers should be selected for an advertizing campaign that can generate maximum returns with minimum investment. In this work, we present an agent-based model (ABM) that can simulate the dynamics of influencer advertizing campaigns in a variety of scenarios and can help to discover the best influencer marketing strategy. Our system is a probabilistic graph-based model that incorporates real-world factors such as customers' interest in a product, customer behavior, the willingness to pay, a brand's investment cap, influencers' engagement with influence diffusion, and the nature of the product being advertized viz. luxury and non-luxury.",

        "abstract": "The ability to learn from limited data, or few-shot learning, is a desirable and often critical requirement for NLP systems. While many existing methods do poorly at learning from a handful of examples, large pretrained language models have recently been shown to be efficient few-shot learners. One approach to few-shot learning, which does not require finetuning of model parameters, is to augment the language model's input with priming text which is typically constructed using task specific descriptions and examples. In this work, we further explore priming-based few-shot learning, with focus on using examples as prompts. We show that presenting examples in the right order is key for generalization. We introduce PERO (Prompting with Examples in the Right Order), where we formulate few-shot learning as search over the set of permutations of the training examples. We show that PERO can learn to generalize efficiently using as few as 10 examples, in contrast to existing approaches. While the newline token is a natural choice for separating the examples in the prompt, we show that learning a new separator token can potentially provide further gains in performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the tasks of sentiment classification, natural language inference and fact retrieval. Finally, we analyze the learned prompts to reveal novel insights, including the idea that two training examples in the right order alone can provide competitive performance for sentiment classification and natural language inference.",

Whether the planet can be habitable or not depends on the possibility to maintain liquid water on its surface, and therefore on the luminosity of its host stars and on the dynamical properties of the planetary orbit. The trajectory of a planet in a double star system can be determined, approximating stars and planets with point masses, by solving numerically the equations of motion of the classical three-body system. In this study, we analyze a large data set of planetary orbits, made up with high precision long integration at varying: the mass of the planet, its distance from the primary star, the mass ratio for the two stars in the binary system, and the eccentricity of the star motion. To simulate the gravitational dynamics, we use a 15th order integration scheme (IAS15, available within the REBOUND framework), that provides an optimal solution for long-term integration. In our data analysis, we evaluate if an orbit is stable or not and also provide the statistics of different types of instability: collisions with the primary or secondary star and planets ejected away from the binary star system. Concerning the stability, we find a significant number of orbits that are only marginally stable, according to the classification introduced by Musielak et al. 2005. For planets of negligible mass, we estimate the critical semi-major axis $a_c$ as a function of the mass ratio and the eccentricity of the binary, in agreement with the results of Holman and Wiegert 1999. However, we find that for very massive planets (Super-Jupiters) the critical semi-major axis decrease in some cases by a few percent, compared to cases in which the mass of the planet is negligible.",

By contrast, for finite-dimensional systems, the relaxation is always algebraic, with a non-trivial universal exponent at high temperatures crossing over to a harmonic value at low temperatures. We demonstrate that this apparent evolution is controlled by a temperature-dependent population of localised excitations. Our work unifies several recent lines of studies aiming at a detailed characterization of the complex potential energy landscape of glass-formers.",

        "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulatory capacity begins before birth as the sympathetic and parasympathetic activity contributes significantly to the fetus' development. Several studies have shown how vagus nerve is involved in many vital processes during fetal, perinatal and postnatal life: from the regulation of inflammation through the anti-inflammatory cholinergic pathway, which may affect the functioning of each organ, to the production of hormones involved in bioenergetic metabolism. In addition, the vagus nerve has been recognized as the primary afferent pathway capable of transmitting information to the brain from every organ of the body. Therefore, this hypothesis paper aims to review the development of ANS during fetal and perinatal life, focusing particularly on the vagus nerve, to identify possible \"critical windows\" that could impact its maturation. These \"critical windows\" could help clinicians know when to monitor fetuses to effectively assess the developmental status of both ANS and specifically the vagus nerve. In addition, this paper will focus on which factors (i.e. fetal characteristics and behaviors, maternal lifestyle and pathologies, placental health and dysfunction, labor, incubator conditions, and drug exposure) may have an impact on the development of the vagus during the above-mentioned \"critical window\" and how. This analysis could help clinicians and stakeholders define precise guidelines for improving the management of fetuses and newborns, particularly to reduce the potential adverse environmental impacts on ANS development that may lead to persistent long-term consequences. Since the development of ANS and the vagus influence have been shown to be reflected in cardiac variability, this paper will rely in particular on studies using fetal heart rate variability (fHRV) to monitor the continued growth and health of both animal and human fetuses.",

Solutions are obtained by assuming that the expansion scalar is proportional to the shear scalar which yields a constant value for the deceleration parameter (q=2). Constraints are obtained by requiring the physical viability of the solutions. A comparison is made between the viscous and non-viscous models, and between the models in GR and in f(R,T) gravity. The metric potentials remain the same in GR and in f(R,T) gravity. Consequently, the geometrical behavior of the $f(R,T)$ gravity models remains the same as the models in GR. It is found that f(R,T) gravity or bulk viscosity does not affect the behavior of effective matter which acts as a stiff fluid in all models. The individual fluids have very rich behavior. In one of the viscous models, the matter either follows a semi-realistic EoS or exhibits a transition from stiff matter to phantom, depending on the values of the parameter. In another model, the matter describes radiation, dust, quintessence, phantom, and the cosmological constant for different values of the parameter. In general, f(R,T) gravity diminishes the effect of bulk viscosity.",

Motivated by these findings, we construct a minimal empirical model to describe this physics and introduce dynamic facilitation in the trap model, which was initially developed to capture the thermally-activated dynamics of glassy systems. We fully characterise the relaxation dynamics of this facilitated trap model varying the functional form of energy distributions and the strength of dynamic facilitation, combining numerical results and analytic arguments. Dynamic facilitation generically accelerates the relaxation of the deepest traps, thus making relaxation spectra strongly asymmetric, with an apparent \"excess\" signal at high frequencies. For well-chosen values of the parameters, the obtained spectra mimic experimental results for organic liquids displaying an excess wing. Overall, our results identify the minimal physical ingredients needed to describe excess processes in relaxation spectra of supercooled liquids.",

Existing methods use a similarity-based metric. However, they cannot make full use of knowledge transfer in NER model parameters. To address the issue, we propose a template-based method for NER, treating NER as a language model ranking problem in a sequence-to-sequence framework, where original sentences and statement templates filled by candidate named entity span are regarded as the source sequence and the target sequence, respectively. For inference, the model is required to classify each candidate span based on the corresponding template scores. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 92.55% F1 score on the CoNLL03 (rich-resource task), and significantly better than fine-tuning BERT 10.88%, 15.34%, and 11.73% F1 score on the MIT Movie, the MIT Restaurant, and the ATIS (low-resource task), respectively.",

Given the predicted lensed gravitational wave events, one can estimate the constraints on the cosmological parameters via the lensing statistics and the time delay methods. With the lensing statistics method, the knowledge of the lens redshifts, even with the moderate uncertainty, will set the tight bound on the energy density parameter $\\Omega_M$ for matter, that is, $0.288\\lesssim\\Omega_M\\lesssim0.314$ at best. The constraint on the Hubble constant $H_0$ can be determined using the time delay method.

Dynamic instrumentation and static analysis are common practices used to automatically find software defects, from strictly non-conforming code constructions to memory corruptions or invalid control flow. LLVM analyser and sanitizer infrastructure, while regularly applied to general-purpose software, originally was not thought to be introduced to heavily restricted environments. In this paper we discuss the specifics of airborne systems with regards to dynamic instrumentation and provide practical considerations to be taken into account for the effective use of general-purpose instrumentation tools. We bring a complete LLVM stack support to JetOS, a prospective onboard real-time operating system currently being developed at ISP RAS in collaboration with GosNIIAS. As an example, we port AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer, and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer and provide the details against the caveats on all relevant sides: a sanitizer, a compiler, and an operating system.

        "abstract": "The theoretical description of Drell-Yan (DY) transverse momentum spectra over wide kinematic regions in energy, mass and transverse momentum requires not only fixed-order perturbative QCD calculations but also soft-gluon QCD resummations to all orders of perturbation theory. The latter are traditionally accomplished either by Parton Showers (PS) with Monte Carlo event generators or by (different versions of) analytical procedures. In this work we focus on issues involved in the matching of the fixed-order calculation and resummation, especially in the moderate to low mass and $p_{\\bot}$ region. In particular we address the DY region accessible at fixed target experiments. We present a Parton Branching (PB) formulation in which transverse momentum dependent (TMD) evolution is matched with MCatNLO calculations of NLO matrix elements. Using this formulation, we show a good theoretical description of DY data from experiments in very different kinematic ranges: NuSea, R209, Phenix, LHC $8\\;\\textrm{TeV}$ and $13\\;\\textrm{TeV}$.",

First we establish that a shear free perturbation of these universes are acceleration-free and the fluid flow geodesics of the background universe maps onto themselves in the perturbed universe. This effect then decouples the evolution equations of the electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor in the perturbed spacetimes and the magnetic part no longer contains any tensor modes. Although the electric part, that drives the tidal forces, do have tensor modes sourced by the anisotropic stress, these modes have homogeneous oscillations at every point on a time slice without any wave propagation. We also show the presence of vorticity vector waves that are sourced by the curl of heat flux. This analysis shows the critical role of the shear tensor in generating cosmological gravitational waves in an expanding universe.",

Here we present a hierarchical Bayesian model of probabilistic classifier fusion based on a new correlated Dirichlet distribution. This distribution explicitly models positive correlations between marginally Dirichlet-distributed random vectors thereby allowing normative modeling of correlations between base classifiers or experts. The proposed model naturally accommodates the classic Independent Opinion Pool and other independent fusion algorithms as special cases. It is evaluated by uncertainty reduction and correctness of fusion on synthetic and real-world data sets. We show that a change in performance of the fused classifier due to uncertainty reduction can be Bayes optimal even for highly correlated base classifiers.",

We studied the correlation between the properties of H$\\beta$ and Mg II lines of a large sample of SDSS DR14 quasars to find high-$z$ NLS1 candidates. Based on the strong correlation of $\\mathrm{FWHM(MgII)=(0.880\\pm 0.005) \\times FWHM(H\\beta)+ (0.438\\pm0.018)}$, we present a sample of high-$z$ NLS1 candidates having FWHM of Mg II $<$ 2000 km s$^{-1}$. The high-$z$ sample contains 2684 NLS1s with redshift $z=0.8-2.5$ with a median logarithmic bolometric luminosity of $46.16\\pm0.42$ erg s$^{-1}$, logarithmic black hole mass of $8.01\\pm0.35 M_{\\odot}$, and logarithmic Eddington ratio of $0.02\\pm0.27$. The fraction of radio-detected high-$z$ NLS1s is similar to that of the low-$z$ NLS1s and SDSS DR14 quasars at a similar redshift range, and their radio luminosity is found to be strongly correlated with their black hole mass.",

Here $R$ is the Ricci scalar, and $\\alpha>0$ is a constant. As an example, we depict that for the same LTB metric governing the spacetime formed due to two different matter-fields, i.e., dust in general relativity and imperfect viscous fluid in $f(R)$ gravity, the singularity is locally visible in the former case, and globally visible in the latter case.",

The reduction is realized by replacing some calculations by DNN inference. The cost reduction depends on the implementation method of the DNN and the accuracy of the DNN inference. Thus, we propose two techniques suitable to infer flow field on the CFD grid. The first technique is to infer the flow field of the steady state from the airfoil shape. We use the position on the coordinates of the grid point and the distance from the surface of the airfoil as input information for the DNN. The second method uses the customized mean square error as a loss function. The size of the associated area for each grid point was multiplied by the square error. This method compensates for the effect caused by the size of the associated area of nonuniform allocation of grid points. The evaluation results show that the CFD incorporated first technique achieves 1.7x speedup against the CFD without DNN, while maintaining equivalent result quality. By implementing the second technique, the CFD realized further 2.3x speed up against the CFD with first technique only.",

Within the popular expectation maximization (EM) framework for learning probabilistic MI-IRL models, we present a warm-start strategy based on up-front clustering of the demonstrations in feature space. Our theoretical analysis shows that this warm-start solution produces a near-optimal reward ensemble, provided the behavior modes satisfy mild separation conditions. We also propose a MI-IRL performance metric that generalizes the popular Expected Value Difference measure to directly assesses learned rewards against the ground-truth reward ensemble. Our metric elegantly addresses the difficulty of pairing up learned and ground truth rewards via a min-cost flow formulation, and is efficiently computable. We also develop a MI-IRL benchmark problem that allows for more comprehensive algorithmic evaluations. On this problem, we find our MI-IRL warm-start strategy helps avoid poor quality local minima reward ensembles, resulting in a significant improvement in behavior clustering. Our extensive sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the quality of the learned reward ensembles is improved under various settings, including cases where our theoretical assumptions do not necessarily hold. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods by discovering distinct driving styles in a large real-world dataset of driver GPS trajectories.",

In this work, we study the latter on quantum many-body systems by the time evolution with fixed couplings and variational magnetic fields. In specific, we consider to prepare the ground states of the Hamiltonians containing certain interactions that are missing in the Hamiltonians for the time evolution. An optimization method is proposed to optimize the magnetic fields by \"fine-graining\" the discretization of time, in order to gain high precision and stability. The back propagation technique is utilized to obtain the gradients of the fields against the logarithmic fidelity. Our method is tested on preparing the ground state of Heisenberg chain with the time evolution by the XY and Ising interactions, and its performance surpasses two baseline methods that use local and global optimization strategies, respectively. Our work can be applied and generalized to other quantum models such as those defined on higher dimensional lattices. It enlightens to reduce the complexity of the required interactions for implementing quantum control or other tasks in quantum information and computation by means of optimizing the magnetic fields.",

Our aim is the validation of these measurements to support future studies of the Sun's AM loss. Methods: We combine 60-minute averages of the proton bulk moments and the magnetic field measured by the Solar Wind Analyser (SWA) and the magnetometer (MAG) onboard Solar Orbiter. We calculate the AM flux per solid-angle element using data from the first orbit of the mission's cruise phase during 2020. We separate the contributions from protons and from magnetic stresses to the total AM flux. Results: The AM flux varies significantly over time. The particle contribution typically dominates over the magnetic-field contribution during our measurement interval. The total AM flux shows the largest variation and is typically anti-correlated with the radial solar-wind speed. We identify a compression region, potentially associated with a co-rotating interaction region or a coronal mass ejection, that leads to a significant localised increase in the AM flux, yet without a significant increase in the AM per unit mass. We repeat our analysis using the density estimate from the Radio and Plasma Waves (RPW) instrument. Using this independent method, we find a decrease in the peaks of positive AM flux but otherwise consistent results. Conclusions: Our results largely agree with previous measurements of the solar-wind AM flux in terms of amplitude, variability, and dependence on radial solar-wind bulk speed. Our analysis highlights the potential for future, more detailed, studies of the solar wind's AM and its other large-scale properties with data from Solar Orbiter. We emphasise the need to study the radial evolution and latitudinal dependence of the AM flux in combination with data from Parker Solar Probe and assets at heliocentric distances of 1 au and beyond.",

Three models were investigated and compared: Linear Regression (LR), Neural Networks (NN), and a type of recurrent neural network Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). In order to achieve the goals, we developed a data collecting python server using Game State Integration (GSI) to track the real-time data of the players. Once the exploratory feature analysis and tuning hyper-parameters were done, our models' experiments took place on different players with dissimilar backgrounds of playing experiences. The achieved accuracy scores depend on the multi-forward prediction parameters, which for the worse case in linear regression 69\\% but on average 82\\%, while in the deep learning models hit the utmost accuracy of prediction on average 88\\% for NN, and 93\\% for LSTM models.",

A comb domain is the entire plane minus an infinite number of vertical rays symmetric with respect to the real axis. In this paper we prove that for any $p\\in [1,+\\infty]$, there is a comb domain with Hardy number equal to $p$ and this result is sharp. It is known that the Hardy number is related with the moments of the exit time of Brownian motion from the domain. In particular, our result implies that given $ p < q$ there exists a comb domain with finite $p$-th moment but infinite $q$-th moment if and only if $q\\geq 1/2$.

        "abstract": "Recent controversies related to topics such as fake news, privacy, and algorithmic bias have prompted increased public scrutiny of digital technologies and soul-searching among many of the people associated with their development. In response, the tech industry, academia, civil society, and governments have rapidly increased their attention to \"ethics\" in the design and use of digital technologies (\"tech ethics\"). Yet almost as quickly as ethics discourse has proliferated across the world of digital technologies, the limitations of these approaches have also become apparent: tech ethics is vague and toothless, is subsumed into corporate logics and incentives, and has a myopic focus on individual engineers and technology design rather than on the structures and cultures of technology production. As a result of these limitations, many have grown skeptical of tech ethics and its proponents, charging them with \"ethics-washing\": promoting ethics research and discourse to defuse criticism and government regulation without committing to ethical behavior. By looking at how ethics has been taken up in both science and business in superficial and depoliticizing ways, I recast tech ethics as a terrain of contestation where the central fault line is not whether it is desirable to be ethical, but what \"ethics\" entails and who gets to define it. This framing highlights the significant limits of current approaches to tech ethics and the importance of studying the formulation and real-world effects of tech ethics. In order to identify and develop more rigorous strategies for reforming digital technologies and the social relations that they mediate, I describe a sociotechnical approach to tech ethics, one that reflexively applies many of tech ethics' own lessons regarding digital technologies to tech ethics itself.",

Dimensionality, exchange interaction, and preponderance of quantum effects all imprint their signatures in the NL magnetic response. Here, we study the NL susceptibilities in the proximate Kitaev magnet $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ which differs from the expected antiferromagnetic behavior. For $T< T_c$ = 7.5 K and field $B$ in the ab-plane, we obtain contrasting NL responses in low ($<$ 2 ${T}$) and high field regions. For low fields the NL behavior is dominated by a quadratic response (positive $\\chi_2$), which shows a rapid rise below $T_c$. This large $\\chi_2 >0$ implies a broken sublattice symmetry of magnetic order at low temperatures. Classical Monte Carlo (CMC) simulations in the standard ${K-H-\\Gamma}$ model secure such a quadratic ${B}$ dependence of ${M}$, only for ${T}$ $\\approx$ ${T}_c$ with ${\\chi}_2$ being zero as ${T}$ $\\rightarrow$ 0. It is also zero for all temperatures in exact diagonalization calculations. On the other hand, we find an exclusive cubic term (${\\chi}_3$) describes the high field NL behavior well. ${\\chi}_3$ is large and positive both below and above ${T}_c$ crossing zero only for ${T}$ $>$ 50 K. In contrast, for $B$~$\\parallel$~c-axis, no separate low/high field behaviors is measured and only a much smaller ${\\chi}_3$ is apparent.",

To date, studies in football analytics have mainly focused on the attacking side of the game, while there has been less work on event-driven metrics for valuing defensive actions (e.g., tackles and interceptions). Therefore in this paper, we use deep learning techniques to define a novel metric that values such defensive actions by studying the threat of passages of play that preceded them. By doing so, we are able to value defensive actions based on what they prevented from happening in the game. Our Defensive Action Expected Threat (DAxT) model has been validated using real-world event-data from the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 English Premier League seasons, and we combine our model outputs with additional features to derive an overall rating of defensive ability for players. Overall, we find that our model is able to predict the impact of defensive actions allowing us to better value defenders using event-data.",

Expanding the number of radio/X-ray samples in Kataoka & Stawarz (2005), we analyzed the data in 12 FR I and 30 FR II radio galaxies, 12 quasars, and 3 BL Lacs that contained 76 knots, 42 hotspots, and 29 radio lobes. We first derived the equipartition magnetic fields in the cores and then estimated those in various jet components by assuming $B_{\\rm est}$ $\\propto$ $d^{-1}$, where $d$ is the distance from the jet base. On the other hand, the magnetic field in large-scale jets (knots, hotspots, and lobes), $B_{\\rm eq}$, can be estimated from the observed flux and spatial extent under the equipartition hypothesis. We show that the magnetic field decreases as the distance along the jet increases, but generally gentler than $\\propto d^{-1}$. The increase in $B_{\\rm eq}/B_{\\rm est}$ at a larger $d$ may suggest the deceleration of the jet around the downstream, but there is no difference between FR I and FR II jets. Moreover, the magnetic fields in the hotspots are systematically larger than those of knots and lobes. Finally, we applied the same analysis to knots and lobes in Centaurus A to check whether the above discussion will hold even in a single jet source.",

The fact that the prediction bands can be built around any regression estimator and that can be easily found in closed form yields a very widely usable method, which is fairly straightforward to implement. In addition, we first introduce and then describe a specific conformal predictor that guarantees an asymptotic result in terms of efficiency and inducing prediction bands able to modulate their width based on the local behavior and magnitude of the functional data.

Even at the highest Reynolds numbers available in laboratory and natural flows such universal power laws have remained elusive. On the other hand, power laws have been observed empirically in derived quantities, namely in the relative scaling in statistics of different orders according to the Extended Self Similarity hypothesis. Here we present experimental results from the Max Planck Variable Density Turbulence Tunnel over an unprecedented range of Reynolds numbers. We find that the velocity difference statistics take a universal functional form that is distinct from a power law. By applying a self-similar model derived for decaying turbulence to our data, an effective scaling exponent for the second moment can be derived that agrees well with that obtained from Extended Self Similarity.",

This mechanism plays an important role in the production of particles with electroweak couplings, and a precise account of photon-initiated (PI) production at the LHC is a key ingredient in the LHC precision physics programme. I will discuss the possibility of modelling PI processes directly via the structure function approach. This can provide percent level precision in the production cross sections, and is therefore well positioned to account for LHC precision requirements. This formalism in addition allows one to make use of another useful feature of photons, namely that they are colour-singlet and can often be emitted elastically (or quasi-elastically) from the proton. I will discuss recent work on applications of the structure function approach to precision calculations of PI production in the inclusive mode, and to 'exclusive' processes with rapidity gaps, which can provide a unique probe of the Standard Model and physics beyond it.",

In a visual understanding application, machines are expected to understand images like human. Inspired by this, we propose a novel self-supervised learning method, named Text-enhanced Visual Deep InfoMax (TVDIM), to learn better visual representations by fully utilizing the naturally-existing multimodal data. Our core idea of self-supervised learning is to maximize the mutual information between features extracted from multiple views of a shared context to a rational degree. Different from previous methods which only consider multiple views from a single modality, our work produces multiple views from different modalities, and jointly optimizes the mutual information for features pairs of intra-modality and inter-modality. Considering the information gap between inter-modality features pairs from data noise, we adopt a \\emph{ranking-based} contrastive learning to optimize the mutual information. During evaluation, we directly use the pre-trained visual representations to complete various image classification tasks. Experimental results show that, TVDIM significantly outperforms previous visual self-supervised methods when processing the same set of images.",

        "abstract": "Integrating discrete probability distributions and combinatorial optimization problems into neural networks has numerous applications but poses several challenges. We propose Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (I-MLE), a framework for end-to-end learning of models combining discrete exponential family distributions and differentiable neural components. I-MLE is widely applicable: it only requires the ability to compute the most probable states; and does not rely on smooth relaxations. The framework encompasses several approaches, such as perturbation-based implicit differentiation and recent methods to differentiate through black-box combinatorial solvers. We introduce a novel class of noise distributions for approximating marginals via perturb-and-MAP. Moreover, we show that I-MLE simplifies to maximum likelihood estimation when used in some recently studied learning settings that involve combinatorial solvers. Experiments on several datasets suggest that I-MLE is competitive with and often outperforms existing approaches which rely on problem-specific relaxations.",

While the concrete meanings behind these terms may differ slightly, several core commonalities persist across all cases. In this position paper we aim to highlight these common features of the multi-scale concept, as a preliminary basis for a generic theory of multi-scale systems. We discuss the concepts of scale and multi-scale systems in general, and then of multi-scale feedback systems in particular, focusing on the role played by information in such systems. Our long-term objective is to develop a general theory of multi-scale feedback systems, applicable across all domains dealing with complex systems.",

The most existing pre-training methods mainly adopt a two-step training procedure, which firstly employs a pre-trained object detector to extract region-based visual features, then concatenates the image representation and text embedding as the input of Transformer to train. However, these methods face problems of using task-specific visual representation of the specific object detector for generic cross-modal understanding, and the computation inefficiency of two-stage pipeline. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end vision-language pre-trained model for both V+L understanding and generation, namely E2E-VLP, where we build a unified Transformer framework to jointly learn visual representation, and semantic alignments between image and text. We incorporate the tasks of object detection and image captioning into pre-training with a unified Transformer encoder-decoder architecture for enhancing visual learning. An extensive set of experiments have been conducted on well-established vision-language downstream tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel VLP paradigm.",

Dropout,as a commonly used regularization technique, stochastically disables neuron ac-tivations during network optimization. However, such complete feature disposal can affect the feature representation and network understanding. Toward betterdescriptions of latent representations, we present DropGraph that learns regularization function by constructing a stand-alone graph from the backbone features. DropGraph first samples stochastic spatial feature vectors and then incorporates graph reasoning methods to generate feature map distortions. This add-on graph regularizes the network during training and can be completely skipped during inference. We provide intuitions on the linkage between graph reasoning andDropout with further discussions on how partial graph reasoning method reduces feature correlations. To this end, we extensively study the modeling of graphvertex dependencies and the utilization of the graph for distorting backbone featuremaps. DropGraph was validated on four tasks with a total of 7 different datasets.The experimental results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art regularizers while leaving the base model structure unmodified during inference.",

We develop a new persistence summary for multilayer networks, called stacked persistence diagram, and prove its stability under input data perturbations.

We determine the effective temperature ($T_{\\textrm{eff}}$) of each star by fitting their spectral energy distributions, as observed by VLT+SHOOTER, with MARCS model atmospheres. We find average temperatures of $T_{\\textrm{eff}_{\\textrm{WLM}}}=4400\\pm202$ K, $T_{\\textrm{eff}_{\\textrm{SMC}}}=4130\\pm103$ K, and $T_{\\textrm{eff}_{\\textrm{LMC}}}=4140\\pm148$ K. From population synthesis analysis, we find that although the Geneva evolutionary models reproduce this trend qualitatively, the RSGs in these models are systematically too cool.

Most existing methods distribute their models' focus to distantly-labeled rationale words entirely and equally, while ignoring the potential important non-rationale words and not distinguishing the importance of different rationale words. In this paper, we propose two novel auxiliary loss functions to make better use of distantly-labeled rationales, which encourage models to maintain their focus on important words beyond labeled rationales (PINs) and alleviate redundant training on non-helpful rationales (NoIRs). Experiments on two representative classification tasks show that our proposed methods can push a classification model to effectively learn crucial clues from non-perfect rationales while maintaining the ability to spread its focus to other unlabeled important words, thus significantly outperform existing methods.",

We propose an algorithm based on neural networks that allows to detect the ergodic bubbles using experimentally measurable two-site correlation functions. Investigating time evolution of the system, we observe a logarithmic in time growth of the ergodic bubbles in the MBL regime. The distribution of the size of ergodic bubbles converges during time evolution to an exponentially decaying distribution in the MBL regime, and a power-law distribution with a thermal peak in the critical regime, supporting thus the scenario of delocalization through the avalanche mechanism. Our algorithm permits to pin-point quantitative differences in time evolution of systems with random and quasiperiodic potentials, as well as to identify rare (Griffiths) events. Our results open new pathways in studies of the mechanisms of thermalization of disordered many-body systems and beyond.",

The speaker gender does not influence the output, and that extending the input text representation with syllable boundaries and lexical stress information does not equally enhance the generated audio across all speaker identities. The visualisation of the t-SNE projections of the natural and synthesised speaker embeddings show that the acoustic model shifts some of the speakers' neural representation, but not all of them. As a result, these speakers have lower performances of the output speech.",

Survey techniques are practically infeasible and selective samples provide no counterfactual. Assigning recruits to contextual units provides one solution, but is vulnerable to problems of ecological inference. In this article, we take inspiration from epidemiology and the protest literature and elaborate a technique to combine survey and ecological approaches. The rare events, multilevel Bayesian contaminated case-control design we propose accounts for individual-level and contextual factors, as well as spatial autocorrelation in the incidence of recruitment. We validate our approach by matching a sample of Islamic State (ISIS) fighters from nine Muslim-majority countries with representative population surveys enumerated shortly before recruits joined the movement. We find that high status individuals in their early twenties who had university education were more likely to join ISIS. We find more mixed evidence for relative deprivation.",

Using multiple large-scale nationally representative datasets, we observe household solid fuel usage to adversely impact school attendance, years of schooling and age-appropriate grade progression among children. This inference is robust to alternative ways of measuring educational outcomes, other datasets, specifications and estimation techniques. Importantly, the effect is found to be more pronounced for females in comparison to the males highlighting the gendered nature of the impact. On exploring possible pathways, we find that the direct time substitution on account of solid fuel collection and preparation can explain the detrimental educational outcomes that include learning outcomes as well, even though we are unable to reject the health channel. In the light of the micro and macro level vulnerabilities posed by the COVID-19 outbreak, the paper recommends interventions that have the potential to fasten the household energy transition towards clean fuel in the post-covid world.",

It is largely debated whether the effect is due to an electric field at the superconductor surface or small currents of high-energy electrons. We shed light on this matter by studying the suppression of superconductivity in sample geometries where the roles of electric field and electron-current flow can be clearly separated. Our results show that suppression of superconductivity does not depend on the presence or absence of an electric field at the surface of the nanowire, but requires a current of high-energy electrons. The suppression is most efficient when electrons are injected into the nanowire, but similar results are obtained also when electrons are passed between two remote electrodes at a distance $d$ to the nanowire (with $d$ in excess of $1~\\mathrm{\\mu m}$). In the latter case, high-energy electrons decay into phonons which propagate through the substrate and affect superconductivity in the nanowire by generating quasiparticles. We show that this process involves a non-thermal phonon distribution, with marked differences from the loss of superconductivity due to Joule heating near the nanowire or an increase in the bath temperature.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a new measure for the overlap of two density functions which provides motivation and interpretation currently lacking with benchmark measures based on the proportion of similar response, also known as the overlap coefficient. We use this new measure to present an alternative to the $p$--value as a guide to the choice of treatment in a comparative trial; where a current treatment and a new treatment are undergoing investigation. We show that it is possible to reject the null hypothesis; i.e. the new treatment is significantly different in response to the old treatment, while the proposed new summary for the same experiment indicates that as low as one in ten individuals subject to the new treatment behave differently to individuals on the old one.",

        "abstract": "Corruption in auctions is a phenomenon that is theoretically still poorly understood, despite the fact that it occurs rather frequently in practice. In this paper, we initiate the study of the social welfare loss caused by a corrupt auctioneer, both in the single-item and the multi-unit auction setting. In our model, the auctioneer may collude with the winners of the auction by letting them lower their bids in exchange for a fixed fraction $\\gamma$ of the surplus. As it turns out, this setting is equivalent to a $\\gamma$-hybrid auction in which the payments are a convex combination (parameterized by $\\gamma$) of the first-price and the second-price payments. Our goal is thus to obtain a precise understanding of the (robust) price of anarchy of $\\gamma$-hybrid auctions. If no further restrictions are imposed on the bids, we prove a bound on the robust POA which is tight (over the entire range of $\\gamma$) for the single-item and the multi-unit auction setting. On the other hand, if the bids satisfy the no-overbidding assumption a more fine-grained landscape of the price of anarchy emerges, depending on the auction setting and the equilibrium notion. We derive tight bounds for single-item auctions up to the correlated price of anarchy and for the pure price of anarchy in multi-unit auctions. These results are complemented by nearly tight bounds on the coarse correlated price of anarchy in both settings.",

The proof relies on the Sandier--Serfaty approach to the $\\Gamma$-convergence of gradient flows. As a by-product, we recover well-posedness for the nonlocal-interaction equation on $\\mathcal{M}$. Uniqueness, on the other hand, is established using a stability argument. We also provide an another approximation to the interaction equation on $\\mathcal{M}$, based on iterating approximately solving an interaction equation on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and projecting to $\\mathcal{M}$. We show convergence of this scheme, together with an estimate on the rate of convergence.

Moreover, there are many efforts to replicate swarming dynamics in mobile robotic systems which take inspiration from natural swarms. In particular, understanding how swarms come apart, change their behavior, and interact with other swarms is a research direction of special interest to the robotics and defense communities. Here we develop a theoretical approach that can be used to predict the parameters under which colliding swarms form a stable milling state. Our analytical methods rely on the assumption that, upon collision, two swarms oscillate near a limit-cycle, where each swarm rotates around the other while maintaining an approximately constant density. Using our methods, we are able to predict the critical swarm-swarm interaction coupling (below which two colliding swarms merely scatter) for nearly aligned collisions as a function of physical swarm parameters. We show that the critical coupling corresponds to a saddle-node bifurcation of a limit-cycle in the constant-density approximation. Finally, we show preliminary results from experiments in which two swarms of micro UAVs collide and form a milling state, which is in general agreement with our theory.",

In this paper, we aim to set out a mathematical theory of abstraction. We provide a precise characterisation of what an abstraction is and, perhaps more importantly, suggest how abstractions can be learnt directly from data both for static datasets and for dynamical systems. We define an abstraction to be a small set of `summaries' of a system which can be used to answer a set of queries about the system or its behaviour. The difference between the ground truth behaviour of the system on the queries and the behaviour of the system predicted only by the abstraction provides a measure of the `leakiness' of the abstraction which can be used as a loss function to directly learn abstractions from data. Our approach can be considered a generalization of classical statistics where we are not interested in reconstructing `the data' in full, but are instead only concerned with answering a set of arbitrary queries about the data. While highly theoretical, our results have deep implications for statistical inference and machine learning and could be used to develop explicit methods for learning precise kinds of abstractions directly from data.",

Furthermore, many material properties are known to be sensitive to slight changes in bond angles. We develop Atomistic Line Graph Neural Network (ALIGNN) using a GNN architecture that performs message passing on both the interatomic bond graph and its line graph corresponding to bond angles. We demonstrate that angle information can be explicitly and efficiently included for materials to provide much improved performance. We train 44 models for predicting several solid-state material properties available in the JARVIS-DFT and materials-project databases. ALIGNN can outperform some of the previously known GNN models by up to 43.8 %.",

Deuterium insertion induces a 23.5 % cell volume increase and a lowering of crystal symmetry compared to the cubic C15 parent compound (Fd-3m SG). The deuteride is monoclinic (P21/c SG) below 330 K and undergoes a first order transition between 330 and 350 K towards a pseudo-cubic structure (R-3m SG) with TO-D = 342(2) K. The compound is ferromagnetic, accompanied by a magnetostrictive effect below TC = 274 K. The analysis of the critical exponents indicates a second order type transition with a deviation from the isotropic 3D Heisenberg model towards the 3D XY model. This implies an easy plane of magnetization in agreement with cell parameter variation showing a planar magnetic orientation. A weak magnetic peak is even observed at the order-disorder transition with a maximum at 343 K. Magnetic entropy variations are characteristic of direct and reverse magnetocaloric effects at TC and TO-D respectively.",

        "abstract": "The high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC will come with unprecedented physics and computing challenges. One of these challenges is the accurate reconstruction of particles in events with up to 200 simultaneous proton-proton interactions. The planned CMS High Granularity Calorimeter offers fine spatial resolution for this purpose, with more than 6 million channels, but also poses unique challenges to reconstruction algorithms aiming to reconstruct individual particle showers. In this contribution, we propose an end-to-end machine-learning method that performs clustering, classification, and energy and position regression in one step while staying within memory and computational constraints. We employ GravNet, a graph neural network, and an object condensation loss function to achieve this task. Additionally, we propose a method to relate truth showers to reconstructed showers by maximising the energy weighted intersection over union using maximal weight matching. Our results show the efficiency of our method and highlight a promising research direction to be investigated further.",

We show that the best-performing output layer type depends on the data distribution drifts or the amount of data available. In particular, in some cases where a standard linear layer would fail, it is sufficient to change the parametrization and get significantly better performance while still training with SGD.

        "abstract": "This thesis tackled two main problems regarding the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Firstly, XmasNet was used to conduct two large experiments on the classification of lesions. Secondly, detection and segmentation experiments were conducted, first on the prostate and afterward on the prostate cancer lesions. The former experiments explored the lesions through a two-dimensional space, while the latter explored models to work with three-dimensional inputs. For this task, the 3D models explored were the 3D U-Net and a pretrained 3D ResNet-18. A rigorous analysis of all these problems was conducted with a total of two networks, two cropping techniques, two resampling techniques, two crop sizes, five input sizes and data augmentations experimented for lesion classification. While for segmentation two models, two input sizes and data augmentations were experimented. However, while the binary classification of the clinical significance of lesions and the detection and segmentation of the prostate already achieve the desired results (0.870 AUC and 0.915 dice score respectively), the classification of the PIRADS score and the segmentation of lesions still have a large margin to improve (0.664 accuracy and 0.690 dice score respectively).",

We build a sequence k-mer graph for the whole dataset based on k-mer co-occurrence and k-mer sequence relationship and then learn DNA Graph Convolutional Network (DNA-GCN) for the whole dataset. Our DNA-GCN is initialized with a one-hot representation for all nodes, and it then jointly learns the embeddings for both k-mers and sequences, as supervised by the known labels of sequences. We evaluate our model on 50 datasets from ENCODE. DNA-GCN shows its competitive performance compared with the baseline model.

Antibody-coated microscopic particles are mixed with a test sample that potentially contains the target antigen, as a result of which the particles form clusters, with a size that is a function of the antigen concentration and the reaction time. Here, we present a quantitative particle agglutination assay that combines mobile lens-free microscopy and deep learning for rapidly measuring the concentration of a target analyte; as its proof-of-concept, we demonstrate high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) testing using human serum samples. A dual-channel capillary lateral flow device is designed to host the agglutination reaction using 4 uL of serum sample with a material cost of 1.79 cents per test. A mobile lens-free microscope records time-lapsed inline holograms of the lateral flow device, monitoring the agglutination process over 3 min. These captured holograms are processed, and at each frame the number and area of the particle clusters are automatically extracted and fed into shallow neural networks to predict the CRP concentration. 189 measurements using 88 unique patient serum samples were utilized to train, validate and blindly test our platform, which matched the corresponding ground truth concentrations in the hs-CRP range (0-10 ug/mL) with an R2 value of 0.912. This computational sensing platform was also able to successfully differentiate very high CRP concentrations (e.g., >10-500 ug/mL) from the hs-CRP range. This mobile, cost-effective and quantitative particle agglutination assay can be useful for various point-of-care sensing needs and global health related applications.",

ObstacleWatch leverages the advanced audio hardware of the smartphone to sense the surrounding obstacles and infers fine-grained information about the frontal obstacle for collision detection. In particular, our system emits well-designed inaudible beep signals from the smartphone built-in speaker and listens to the reflections with the stereo recording of the smartphone. By analyzing the reflected signals received at two microphones, ObstacleWatch is able to extract fine-grained information of the frontal obstacle including the distance, angle, and size for detecting the possible collisions and to alert users. Our experimental evaluation under two real-world environments with different types of phones and obstacles shows that ObstacleWatch achieves over 92% accuracy in predicting obstacle collisions with distance estimation errors at about 2 cm. Results also show that ObstacleWatch is robust to different sizes of objects and is compatible with different phone models with low energy consumption.",

        "abstract": "Voice authentication is drawing increasing attention and becomes an attractive alternative to passwords for mobile authentication. Recent advances in mobile technology further accelerate the adoption of voice biometrics in an array of diverse mobile applications. However, recent studies show that voice authentication is vulnerable to replay attacks, where an adversary can spoof a voice authentication system using a pre-recorded voice sample collected from the victim. In this paper, we propose VoiceLive, a liveness detection system for both text-dependent and text-independent voice authentication on smartphones. VoiceLive detects a live user by leveraging the user's unique vocal system and the stereo recording of smartphones. In particular, utilizing the built-in gyroscope, loudspeaker, and microphone, VoiceLive first measures the smartphone's distance and angle from the user, then it captures the position-specific time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) changes in a sequence of phoneme sounds to the two microphones of the phone, and uses such unique TDoA dynamic which doesn't exist under replay attacks for liveness detection. VoiceLive is practical as it doesn't require additional hardware but two-channel stereo recording that is supported by virtually all smartphones. Our experimental evaluation with 12 participants and different types of phones shows that VoiceLive achieves over 99% detection accuracy at around 1% Equal Error Rate (EER) on the text-dependent system and around 99% accuracy and 2% EER on the text-independent one. Results also show that VoiceLive is robust to different phone positions, i.e. the user is free to hold the smartphone with distinct distances and angles.",

Although these mechanism are effective for stiff position control of pick-and-place, they are inappropriate for legged robots that must rapidly regulate compliant interactions with the environment. However, no metric exists to quantify the robot's performance degradation due to mechanical losses in the actuators and transmissions. This paper provides a fundamental formulation that uses the mechanical efficiency of transmissions to quantify the effect of power losses in the mechanical transmissions on the dynamics of a whole robotic system. We quantitatively demonstrate the intuitive fact that the apparent inertia of the robots increase in the presence of joint friction. We also show that robots that employ high gear ratio and low efficiency transmissions can statically sustain more substantial external loads. We expect that the framework presented here will provide the fundamental tools for designing the next generation of legged robots that can effectively interact with the world.",

By applying a reliable systematic thickness t dependent measurement of sheet conductance, here we elucidate the dimensionality of the electrical conduction paths of a Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2. Under the ferromagnetic phase, the 2D conduction path clearly emerges in Co3Sn2S2 thin films, indicating a formation of the Fermi arcs projected from Weyl nodes. Comparison between 3D conductivity and 2D conductance provides the effective thickness of the surface conducting region being estimated to be approximately 20 nm, which is rather thicker than 5 nm in topological insulator Bi2Se3. This large value may come from the narrow gap at Weyl point and relatively weak spin-orbit interaction of the Co3Sn2S2. The emergent surface conduction will provide a pathway to activate quantum and spintronic transport features stemming from a Weyl node in thin-film-based devices.",

We introduce three stages of sophistication in the macromagnetic model. First, by using tailor-made hamiltonians we study single nanoparticles. In a second stage, the internal structure of the nanoparticle is taken into consideration by defining an internal (core) and external (shell) region, respectively. In the last stage, an assembly of core/shell NPs are considered. All internal magnetic couplings such as inter and intra-atomic exchange interactions or magnetocrystalline anisotropies have been estimated. Moreover, the hysteresis loops of the aforementioned three cases have been calculated and compared with recent experimental measurements. In the case of the assembly of nanoparticles, the hysteresis loops together with the zero-field cooling and field cooling curves are shown to be in a very good agreement with the experimental data. The current model provides an important tool to understand the internal structure of the nanoparticles together with the complex internal spin interactions of the core-shell ferrite nanoparticles.",

        "abstract": "We develop a bottom-up holographic theory of linear meson Regge trajectories that generalizes and unites into one logical framework various approaches proposed in the past and scattered in the literature. The starting point of the theory is a quadratic in fields holographic five-dimensional action in which the Poincar\u00e9 invariance along the holographic coordinate is violated in the most general way compatible with the linear Regge behavior of the discrete spectrum in four dimensions. It is further demonstrated how different Soft Wall (SW) like holographic models existing in the literature plus some new ones emerge from our general setup. Various interrelations between the emerging models are studied. These models include the known SW models with different sign in the exponential background, the SW models with certain generalized backgrounds, with modified metrics, and models with the mass term depending on the holographic coordinate in a simple polynomial way. We argue that this dependence allows to describe the effects caused by the main non-local phenomena of strongly coupled 4D gauge theory, the confinement and chiral symmetry breaking, in terms of a local 5D dual field theory in the AdS space. We provide a detailed comparison of our approach with the Light Front holographic QCD, with the spectroscopic predictions of the dual Veneziano like amplitudes, and with the experimental Regge phenomenology. A renormalization recipe is formulated that allows to avoid the problem of unphysical massless pole arising in the vector case in a general situation. The given recipe can be used to predict the intercept of linear radial trajectory related with the ground state mass. We apply our general approach to a holographic study of confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and the pion form factor.",

        "abstract": "Premier cloud service providers (CSPs) offer two types of purchase options, namely on-demand and spot instances, with time-varying features in availability and price. Users like startups have to operate on a limited budget and similarly others hope to reduce their costs. While interacting with a CSP, central to their concerns is the process of cost-effectively utilizing different purchase options possibly in addition to self-owned instances. A job in data-intensive applications is typically represented by a directed acyclic graph which can further be transformed into a chain of tasks. The key to achieving cost efficiency is determining the allocation of a specific deadline to each task, as well as the allocation of different types of instances to the task. In this paper, we propose a framework that determines the optimal allocation of deadlines to tasks. The framework also features an optimal policy to determine the allocation of spot and on-demand instances in a predefined time window, and a near-optimal policy for allocating self-owned instances. The policies are designed to be parametric to support the usage of online learning to infer the optimal values against the dynamics of cloud markets. Finally, several intuitive heuristics are used as baselines to validate the cost improvement brought by the proposed solutions. We show that the cost improvement over the state-of-the-art is up to 24.87% when spot and on-demand instances are considered and up to 59.05% when self-owned instances are considered.",

The molecular gas consists of a filamentary cloud of 5-pc length with 1.5-pc width where two dense cloud cores are embedded. The filament lies between two clouds, which have a velocity difference of 2.6 km s$^{-1}$ and are extended over $\\sim$5 pc. We frame a scenario that the two clouds are colliding with each other and compressed the gas between them to form the filament in $\\sim$0.5 Myr which is perpendicular to the collision. It is likely that the collision formed not only the filamentary cloud but also the two dense cores. One of the dense cores is associated with the high-mass protostellar candidate IRAS 05358+3543, a representative high-mass protostar. In the monolithic collapse scheme of high mass star formation, a compact dense core of 100 $M_\\odot$ within a volume of 0.1 pc radius is assumed as the initial condition, whereas the formation of such a core remained unexplained in the previous works. We argue that the proposed collision is a step which efficiently collects the gas of 100 $M_\\odot$ into 0.1 pc radius. This lends support for that the cloud-cloud collision is an essential process in forming the compact high-mass dense core, IRAS 05358+3543.",

In this paper we follow a different approach and obtain a bound on the degree of the polynomials that define the closure. Our bound shows that the closure can be computed in elementary time. We describe several applications of this result, e.g., concerning quantum automata and quantum universal gates. We also obtain an upper bound on the length of a strictly increasing chain of linear algebraic groups, all of which are generated over a fixed number field.",

Algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods are one of the most common methods of solving such linear systems, with an extensive body of underlying mathematical theory. A system of linear equations defines a graph on the set of unknowns and each level of a multigrid solver requires the selection of an appropriate coarse graph along with restriction and interpolation operators that map to and from the coarse representation. The efficiency of the multigrid solver depends critically on this selection and many selection methods have been developed over the years. Recently, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to directly learn the AMG interpolation and restriction operators, given a coarse graph selection. In this paper, we consider the complementary problem of learning to coarsen graphs for a multigrid solver. We propose a method using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which can learn to perform graph coarsening on small training graphs and then be applied to unstructured large graphs. We demonstrate that this method can produce better coarse graphs than existing algorithms, even as the graph size increases and other properties of the graph are varied. We also propose an efficient inference procedure for performing graph coarsening that results in linear time complexity in graph size.",

Technically the May--Leonard models offer a mathematical framework to describe the mentioned non-transitive interaction of competing species when individual movement is also considered in a spatial system. Emerging rotating spirals composed by the competing species are frequently observed character of the resulting patterns. But how do these spiraling patterns change when we vary the external environment which affects the general vitality of individuals? Motivated by this question we suggest an off-lattice version of the tradition May--Leonard model which allows us to change the actual state of the environment gradually. This can be done by introducing a local carrying capacity parameter which value can be varied gently in an off-lattice environment. Our results support a previous analysis obtained in a more intricate metapopulation model and we show that the well-known rotating spirals become evident in a benign environment when the general density of the population is high. The accompanying time-dependent oscillation of competing species can also be detected where the amplitude and the frequency show a scaling law of the parameter that characterizes the state of the environment. These observations highlight that the assumed non-transitive interaction alone is insufficient condition to maintain biodiversity safely, but the actual state of the environment, which characterizes the general living conditions, also plays a decisive role on the evolution of related systems.",

The second part is concerned with topological embedding methods, in particular mapping topological properties into persistence diagrams. Another type of data sets with a tremendous growth is very high-dimensional network data. The task considered in part three is how to embed such data in a vector space of moderate dimension to make the data amenable to traditional techniques such as cluster and classification techniques. The final part of the survey deals with embedding in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which is visualization. Three methods are presented: $t$-SNE, UMAP and LargeVis based on methods in parts one, two and three, respectively.

We find that the synergy of the GW standard siren observations and the 21 cm IM surveys could break the cosmological parameter degeneracies.

Without sufficient high-quality annotations, the usual data-driven learning-based approaches struggle with deficient training. On the other hand, directly introducing additional data with low-quality annotations may confuse the network, leading to undesirable performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose a novel mean-teacher-assisted confident learning framework to robustly exploit the noisy labeled data for the challenging hepatic vessel segmentation task. Specifically, with the adapted confident learning assisted by a third party, i.e., the weight-averaged teacher model, the noisy labels in the additional low-quality dataset can be transformed from \"encumbrance\" to \"treasure\" via progressive pixel-wise soft-correction, thus providing productive guidance. Extensive experiments using two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework as well as the effectiveness of each component.",

The proposed method allows us to separately estimate a spectral distribution of illumination, reflectance, or camera sensitivity, while recent hyperspectral cameras are limited to capturing a joint spectral distribution from a scene. In addition, the use of Bayesian inference makes it possible to take into account prior information of both spectral distributions and image noise as probability distributions. As a result, the proposed method can estimate spectral distributions in a unified way, and it can enhance the robustness of the estimation against noise, which conventional spectral-distribution estimation methods cannot. The use of Bayesian inference also enables us to obtain the confidence of estimation results. In an experiment, the proposed method is shown not only to outperform conventional estimation methods in terms of RMSE but also to be robust against noise.",

A major challenge for neuromorphic computing is that learning algorithms for traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) do not transfer directly to spiking neural networks (SNNs) due to the discrete spikes and more complex neuronal dynamics. As a consequence, SNNs have not yet been successfully applied to complex, large-scale tasks. In this article, we focus on the self-supervised learning problem of optical flow estimation from event-based camera inputs, and investigate the changes that are necessary to the state-of-the-art ANN training pipeline in order to successfully tackle it with SNNs. More specifically, we first modify the input event representation to encode a much smaller time slice with minimal explicit temporal information. Consequently, we make the network's neuronal dynamics and recurrent connections responsible for integrating information over time. Moreover, we reformulate the self-supervised loss function for event-based optical flow to improve its convexity. We perform experiments with various types of recurrent ANNs and SNNs using the proposed pipeline. Concerning SNNs, we investigate the effects of elements such as parameter initialization and optimization, surrogate gradient shape, and adaptive neuronal mechanisms. We find that initialization and surrogate gradient width play a crucial part in enabling learning with sparse inputs, while the inclusion of adaptivity and learnable neuronal parameters can improve performance. We show that the performance of the proposed ANNs and SNNs are on par with that of the current state-of-the-art ANNs trained in a self-supervised manner.",

        "abstract": "Reference-based Super-Resolution (Ref-SR) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm to enhance a low-resolution (LR) input image by introducing an additional high-resolution (HR) reference image. Existing Ref-SR methods mostly rely on implicit correspondence matching to borrow HR textures from reference images to compensate for the information loss in input images. However, performing local transfer is difficult because of two gaps between input and reference images: the transformation gap (e.g. scale and rotation) and the resolution gap (e.g. HR and LR). To tackle these challenges, we propose C2-Matching in this work, which produces explicit robust matching crossing transformation and resolution. 1) For the transformation gap, we propose a contrastive correspondence network, which learns transformation-robust correspondences using augmented views of the input image. 2) For the resolution gap, we adopt a teacher-student correlation distillation, which distills knowledge from the easier HR-HR matching to guide the more ambiguous LR-HR matching. 3) Finally, we design a dynamic aggregation module to address the potential misalignment issue. In addition, to faithfully evaluate the performance of Ref-SR under a realistic setting, we contribute the Webly-Referenced SR (WR-SR) dataset, mimicking the practical usage scenario. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed C2-Matching significantly outperforms state of the arts by over 1dB on the standard CUFED5 benchmark. Notably, it also shows great generalizability on WR-SR dataset as well as robustness across large scale and rotation transformations.",

All methods are embedded into a unified low-Mach framework based on a Cartesian-grid finite-volume discretization. This framework includes a sharp transport of the interface, a wellbalanced surface tension discretization and a consistent mass and momentum transport which allows capillary-driven simulations with high density ratio. The comparison relies on shared metrics for geometrical accuracy, mass and momentum conservation which exposes the weakness and strengths of each method. Finally, the versatility and capabilities of the proposed solver are demonstrated on the simulation of a 3D head-on collision of two water droplets. Overall, all methods manage to retrieve reasonable results for all test cases presented. VOF, CLSVOF and ACLS tend to artificially create little structures while SLS suffers from conservation issues in the mesh resolution limit. This study leads us to the conclusion that CLSVOF is the most promising method for two-phase flow simulations in our specific framework because of its inherent conservation properties and topology accuracy.",

Automatic analysis of heart sounds for abnormality detection is faced with the challenges of additive noise and sensor-dependent degradation. This paper aims to develop methods to address the cardiac abnormality detection problem when both types of distortions are present in the cardiac auscultation sound. We first mathematically analyze the effect of additive and convolutional noise on short-term filterbank-based features and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layer. Based on the analysis, we propose a combination of linear and logarithmic spectrogram-image features. These 2D features are provided as input to a residual CNN network (ResNet) for heart sound abnormality detection. Experimental validation is performed on an open-access heart sound abnormality detection dataset involving noisy recordings obtained from multiple stethoscope sensors. The proposed method achieves significantly improved results compared to the conventional approaches, with an area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristics) curve (AUC) of 91.36%, F-1 score of 84.09%, and Macc (mean of sensitivity and specificity) of 85.08%. We also show that the proposed method shows the best mean accuracy across different source domains including stethoscope and noise variability, demonstrating its effectiveness in different recording conditions. The proposed combination of linear and logarithmic features along with the ResNet classifier effectively minimizes the impact of background noise and sensor variability for classifying phonocardiogram (PCG) signals. The proposed method paves the way towards developing computer-aided cardiac auscultation systems in noisy environments using low-cost stethoscopes.",

Therefore, object recognition and grasping are two key functionalities for such robots. Most state-of-the-art tackles object recognition and grasping as two separate problems while both use visual input. Furthermore, the knowledge of the robot is fixed after the training phase. In such cases, if the robot faces new object categories, it must retrain from scratch to incorporate new information without catastrophic interference. To address this problem, we propose a deep learning architecture with augmented memory capacities to handle open-ended object recognition and grasping simultaneously. In particular, our approach takes multi-views of an object as input and jointly estimates pixel-wise grasp configuration as well as a deep scale- and rotation-invariant representation as outputs. The obtained representation is then used for open-ended object recognition through a meta-active learning technique. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to grasp never-seen-before objects and to rapidly learn new object categories using very few examples on-site in both simulation and real-world settings.",

We construct exact and parametric solutions for nonassociative vacuum configurations (with nontrivial or effective cosmological constants) defined by star deformed generic off-diagonal (non) symmetric metrics and (generalized) nonlinear and linear connections. The coefficients of geometric objects defining such solutions are determined by respective classes of generating and integration functions and constants and may depend on all phase space coordinates [spacetime ones, $(x^{i},t)$; and momentum like variables, $(p_{a},E$)].

Despite this success story, AMMs are well-known to suffer from transaction-ordering issues: indeed, adversaries can frontrun user transactions to increase their gain to the detriment of honest users. Being specifically designated to arrange user transactions into blocks, miners can easily play the role of adversary, by suitably selecting and ordering transactions - and possibly inserting their own - to increase their gain. In this paper we formally characterize rational miners as players which follow an optimal strategy in the mining game. We identify relevant variants of the game, corresponding to specific real-world constraints that a miner might have. We devise effective procedures to construct solutions to mining game, both in its most general form and in some relevant variants.

We also present a maintenance planning model using a risk-based decision-making method, which identifies the maintenance decision with minimal economic risk of the truck company. Both availability losses and maintenance costs are considered when evaluating the economic risk. We demonstrate the proposed model by numerical experiments illustrating real-world scenarios. In the experiments, compared to three baseline methods, the expected economic risk of the proposed method is reduced by up to $47\\%$. We also conduct sensitivity analyses of different model parameters. The analyses show that the economic risk significantly decreases when the estimation accuracy of remaining useful life, the maximal allowed time of delivery delay before order cancellation, or the number of workshops increases. The experiment results contribute to identifying future research and development attentions of autonomous trucks from an economic perspective.",

In such simulations with low dissipation, errors of round-off level might grow and contaminate the numerical solutions. A typical example of such problems is the loss of symmetry in the numerical solutions for physical problems of symmetric configurations even if the schemes are mathematically in line with the symmetry rules. In this study, the mechanisms of symmetry-breaking in a finite volume framework with the P$_4$T$_2$-BVD reconstruction scheme are thoroughly examined. Particular attention has been paid to remove the possible causes due to the lack of associativity in floating-point arithmetic which is associated with round-off errors.

We here investigate the number of cliques of any size $k$ contained in a geometric inhomogeneous random graph: a scale-free network model containing geometry. The interplay between scale-freeness and geometry ensures that connections are likely to form between either high-degree vertices, or between close by vertices. At the same time it is rare for a vertex to have a high degree, and most vertices are not close to one another. This trade-off makes cliques more likely to appear between specific vertices. In this paper, we formalize this trade-off and prove that there exists a predominant type of clique in terms of the degrees and the positions of the vertices that span the clique. Moreover, we show that the asymptotic number of cliques as well as the predominant clique type undergoes a phase transition, in which only $k$ and the degree-exponent $\\tau$ are involved. Interestingly, this phase transition shows that for small values of $\\tau$, the underlying geometry of the model is irrelevant: the number of cliques scales the same as in a non-geometric network model.",

They are governed by three parameters associated to the mass, axial torsion and amplitude of the internal soliton, and two ones to the gravitational hair. They describe geometries that can be a global AdS space, naked singularity or a (non-)extremal black hole. We analyze physical properties of two inequivalent asymptotically AdS solutions when the spatial section at radial infinity is either a 3-sphere or a projective 3-space. An important feature of these 3-parametric solutions is that they possess a topological structure including two $SU(2)$ solitons that wind nontrivially around the black hole horizon, as characterized by the Pontryagin index. In the extremal black hole limit, the solitons' strengths match and a soliton-antisoliton system unwinds. That limit admits both non-BPS and BPS configurations. For the latter, the pure gauge and non-pure gauge solutions preserve $1/2$ and $1/16$ of the original supersymmetries, respectively. In a general case, we compute conserved charges in Hamiltonian formalism, finding many similarities with standard supergravity black holes.",

Spatial synchronization is a challenge, because of the Poynting instability that can be a concern both for the interacting electron beam (if laser-generated) and the scattering laser. One strategy to overcome this problem is to use an electron beam coming from an accelerator (e.g. the planned E-320 experiment at FACET-II). Even using a stable accelerator beam, the plane wave approximation is too simplistic to describe the laser-electron scattering. This work extends analytical scaling laws for pair production, previously derived for the case of a plane wave and a short electron beam. We consider a focused laser beam colliding with electron beams of different shapes and sizes. The results take the spatial and temporal synchronization of the interaction into account, can be extended to arbitrary beam shapes, and prescribe the optimization strategies for near-future experiments.",

Bishop introduced the category of complemented subsets of a set, in order to overcome the problems generated by the use of negation in constructive measure theory. Shulman mentions that Bishop's complemented subsets correspond roughly to the Chu construction. In this paper we explain this correspondence by showing that there is a Chu representation (a full embedding) of the category of complemented subsets of a set X into Chu(Set, X x X). A Chu representation of the category of Bishop spaces into Chu(Set, R) is shown, as the constructive analogue to the standard Chu representation of the category of topological spaces into Chu(Set, 2). In order to represent the category of predicates (with objects pairs (X, A), where A is a subset of X, and the category of complemented predicates (with objects pairs (X, A), where A is a complemented subset of X, we generalise the Chu construction by defining the Chu category over a cartesian closed category C and an endofunctor on C. Finally, we introduce the antiparallel Grothendieck construction over a product category and a contra-variant Set-valued functor on it of which the Chu construction is a special case, in case C is a locally small, cartesian closed category.",

However, it is still unclear how to determine an appropriate effective Brinkman viscosity without resolving the flow at the pore scale. Here, we propose to determine the Brinkman viscosity for rough porous media from the interface slip length and the interior permeability. Both slip and permeability can be determined from unit-cell analysis, thus enabling an a priori estimate of the effective viscosity. By comparing the velocity distribution in the porous material predicted from the Brinkman equation with that obtained from pore-scale resolved simulations, we show that modelling errors are $\\sim 10\\%$ and not larger than $40\\%$. We highlight the physical origins of the obtained errors and demonstrate that the Brinkman model can be much more accurate for irregular porous structures.",

These detection schemes, even if they facilitate transient single-molecule detection [7,8] via consequent formation and cleavage of chemical bonds, typically exhibit time resolutions on the order of milliseconds. The need for analyte immobilisation is a direct consequence of the minuscule dimensions of plasmonic near fields typically providing sub-attolitre-sized detection volumes which in turn demand sub-microsecond temporal resolution for the direct detection of proteins in motion. Here we show that such temporal resolution can indeed be achieved. We demonstrate the observation of single proteins as small as Hemoglobin (molecular weight: 64 kDa) as they traverse plasmonic near fields of gold nanorods and interact with their surface, all while maintaining signal-to-noise ratios larger than 5 and an unprecedented temporal resolution well below microseconds. This method enables the label-free observation of single-molecule dynamics on previously unaccessible timescales.",
