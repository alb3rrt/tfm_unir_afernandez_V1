Abstract Novel implications on neutron stars come from extended gravity. Specifically, the GW190814 event indicated the probability of having large mass stars in the mass-gap region 2.5 - 5 M . If the secondary component of GW190814 is a neutron star, such large masses are marginally supported by General Relativity (GR), since a very stiff artyom.art@gmail.com capozziello@na.infn.it odintsov@ieec.uab.es §v.k.oikonomou1979@gmail.com,voikonomou@auth.gr

Equation of State (EoS) would be needed to describe such large mass neutron stars, which would be incompatible with the GW170817 event, without any modification of gravity. In view of the two groundbreaking gravitational wave observations, we critically discuss the elevated role of extensions of GR towards the successful description of the GW190814 event, and we also speculate in a quantitative way on the important issue of the largest allowed neutron star mass.

Neutron stars are proven literally to be the superstars of all stellar structures, not unjustifiably. Since the striking observation of Jocelyn Bell back in 1967, they have been in the epicenter of many scientific disciplines, apart from astrophysics. The last decade two striking gravitational waves observations of the LIGO-Virgo collaboration have set the stage for a new way of thinking both in theoretical cosmology and in theoretical astrophysics. The GW170817 [1] has proven definitive for some classes of Horndeski theories, and also had further constrained the neutron star masses and radii, while the GW190814 event [2] has proven even more interesting due to the possibilities and perspectives of the secondary component interpretation.
Extensions of GR [3] can play a key role towards describing the secondary component of the GW190814 event, if it is proven to be a neutron star. The main reason is that the candidate theories naturally yield neutron star masses in the range 2.5 - 3 M , without "stretching" general relativistic models. The main feature of extended gravity theories is that geometry plays the role of the effective energy momentum tensor, so neutron stars with masses in the range 2.5 - 3 M can be easily described by several candidate models [4]. In GR, where obviously modified gravity effects are absent, one needs a quite stiff EoS for nuclear matter to describe neutron stars with mass 2.5 - 3 M . On the other hand, geometric effective contribution to the energy momentum tensor renders modified gravity, in general, and extended gravity in particular, very appealing to describe large mass neutron stars. Let us briefly recall the theoretical framework of one of the most important extension of GR, namely f (R) gravity, coinciding with the Einstein theory in the case f (R) = R. The Jordan frame gravitational action is,

with g being the determinant of the metric tensor gµ and Lmatter the perfect matter fluid Lagrangian. In the context of the metric formalism, upon variation with respect to the metric tensor, the field equations are

Inside the neutron star, the perfect matter fluid energy momentum tensor is Tµ = diag(e2c2, e2p, r2p, r2p sin2 ) where  and p are the matter energy density and the

The numerical integration of TOV equations for the R2 model [4] is presented in Fig. 1 where, for larger values of the coupling parameter , higher neutron star masses result. Clearly they can naturally fill up the mass-gap region. Thus, from a phenomenological point of view,

extended gravity can predict neutron stars with masses in the lower edge of the mass-gap

region.

Coming to the predictions of extended gravity, the fundamental question is: How large

can a neutron star mass be? This question is of fundamental importance, and the only

consistent way to see what is the maximum neutron star in the context of any theory is to

examine the problem by choosing the stiffest possible EoS for nuclear matter. The stiffest

EoS, which simultaneously respects the high density stability condition for nuclear matter

(

and

is

the

causal

EoS with the following form,

Psn() = Pu(u) + ( - u)c2 ,

(9)

with u being the maximum density for nuclear matter, and Pu(u) the corresponding pressure. By assuming this EoS, one obtains the maximum upper mass for neutron stars, which, in the context of GR for slowly rotating neutron stars, is [5, 6],

MmCaLx = 3M

5 × 1014g/cm3 ,
u

(10)

thus in the context of GR, the maximum mass limit of slowly rotating neutron stars is,

Mmax  3M .

(11)

If rotation is taken into account, the causal limit of the maximum neutron mass becomes,

MmCaLx,rot = 3.89M

5 × 1014g/cm3 .
u

(12)

Therefore, in the context of GR, one expects to find neutron stars in, but not deeply in

the mass gap region M  2.5 - 5 M , and specifically in the region M  2.5 - 3 M ,

and this under extreme conditions. With regard to any modified gravity, the question is

whether the 3 solar masses upper limit of GR is respected. Remarkably for f (R) gravity,

the answer is yes [7], as we now evince. Consider that the nuclear matter has the following

causal EoS,

Psn() = Pu(u) + ( - u)vs2 ,

(13)

where vs is the sound speed, we shall assume that it varies in the range c2/3  vs2  c2 [8]. Also the transition density will be assumed to be that of the SLy EoS at u = 20, where
0 is the nuclear matter saturation density. The results of the numerical integration of the TOV equations for the R2 model are presented in Table 1 The results of the numerical

analysis are particularly interesting. Firstly, in all studied case, the 3 solar masses limit

of GR is well respected. Let us discuss in brief the outcomes of our analysis, starting from

the effect of the parameter . As it can be seen in Table 1, for values of the sound speed less than the speed of light, the causal maximum mass for the R2 model is larger than

that of GR, while when the sound speed is equal to the light speed, when small values of  are used, the GR causal maximum mass limit is larger compared to the R2 model. On

the contrary, for large values of , the R2 model dominates over GR. We have to note here

that the parameter  for the R2 model in cosmological contexts, must take small values.

for

early time phenomenological reasons [9], with N being the e-foldings number. So basically

 must take small values in order for the theory to be cosmologically consistent. This issue

has been addressed more thoroughly in Refs. [10, 11] in the Einstein frame for potentials

that belong in the same class as the R2 model when considered in the Einstein frame. So

we refer the reader to Refs. [10, 11] for a detailed discussion on these issues.

Thus, coming to the issue on where to expect to find the maximum neutron star masses,

the prediction for extended gravity is in the range M  2.5 - 3 M . The main difference

with GR, is the freedom in the choice of EoS for nuclear matter.

Let us note that it is remarkable that observationally-friendly increase of neutron

stars maximum mass due to extended gravity is in compliance with inflationary attractors

Universe, which is consistent with Planck data.

Having discovered the mass range of neutron stars even in extended gravity, the great

question is: What is the lowest mass limit of an astrophysical black hole? Without being

very strict, the answer is that astrophysical black holes can have masses above 3 solar

masses. But in order to be sure on this, one must calculate the baryon masses for neutron

stars in the context of extended gravity. This will definitely answer, in a concrete way, the

above question, because, if the baryon mass is larger than the maximum baryon mass, the

neutron star will collapse to a black hole. Thus automatically, one has available the lowest

astrophysical black hole mass limit. Finally, let us comment that the same procedure

performed in this paper, can be applied in other modified gravity theories, such as f (T )

gravity, in which the spherically symmetric solutions have also extended terms similar to

the ones of f (R) gravity, see for example [12, 13].
