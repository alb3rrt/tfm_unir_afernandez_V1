In this paper we consider the one-dimensional dynamical evolution of a particle traveling at constant speed and performing, at a given rate, random reversals of the velocity direction. The particle is subject to stochastic resetting, meaning that at random times it is forced to return to the starting point. Here we consider a return mechanism governed by a deterministic law of motion, so that the time cost required to return is correlated to the position occupied at the time of the reset. We show that in such conditions the process reaches a stationary state which, for some kinds of deterministic return dynamics, is independent of the return phase. Furthermore, we investigate the first-passage properties of the system and provide explicit formulas for the mean first-hitting time. Our findings are supported by numerical simulations.

I. INTRODUCTION
Stochastic processes under resetting have attracted growing interest in the last few years. Such processes may be represented by a diffusing particle which, at random or fixed times, is reset to a given position, which usually coincides with the starting point [1]. One can find models of this kind in many fields: For example in biophysics this is a good way to reproduce the Michaelis-Menten reaction scheme [2, 3]. In biology, stochastic resetting is used to describe the competition between RNA polymerization and polymerases backtracking along the DNA template [4]. In fields such as computer science [5, 6] and biological physics [7], algorithms and patterns with random restarts are identified as optimal search strategies.
In the literature there is a rich variety of examples where one analyzes the effects of resetting on different kinds of stochastic motion, ranging from ContinuousTime Random Walks [8­12] to Lévy flights [13, 14]. Also, the domain of waiting time distributions between resetting events considered thus far covers exponential distributions [15], power-laws [12, 16, 17] and includes the case of resetting at fixed times, which has been recognized as the most effective resetting protocol for search processes [18­20]. Nevertheless, in the most common formulation the dynamics is governed by Brownian motion, the resetting is stochastic, occurring at constant rate [15, 21], and the return is instantaneous. This picture, however, presents at least two flaws. First, Brownian motion is not always the best model to describe the stochastic dynamics of the system, especially when it is probed at microscopic scales and one needs to take into account the effects of a finite speed of propagation. A well-known case of study is the run-and-tumble motion of Escherichia coli bacteria [22, 23], but we can find such situations when dealing with long-chain polymers [24], chemotaxis [25] and active matter [26, 27]. In this regard, the simplest models to incorporate the momentum dynamics into the

stochastic evolution of the displacement are the persistent random walk [28] and its continuous-time counterpart, known as the Telegraphic process [29]. This observation led to an increasing interest in the study of the Telegraphic process undergoing stochastic resetting [30­ 32]. The second problem is related to the fact that it is not always possible to neglect the time cost needed to return to the initial location after the reset. The literature offers models including random refractory times preceding the return [33­35], but these do not consider spatiotemporal correlations. For this reason, recent works introduced the idea that the return to the starting location should be performed according to a deterministic law [36­40]. In particular, Ref. [40] provides a theory to treat analytically a stochastic process subject to resetting for which the return to the starting point is ruled by a general equation of motion.
The aim of this paper is to investigate the properties of the one-dimensional Telegraphic process undergoing stochastic Poissonian resetting with a deterministic dynamics towards the starting site, by using the analytical tools presented in [40]. Since explicit results can be obtained if we can determine the return time from the equation of motion, we will consider three types of return motion for which this is doable: (i) motion at constant speed; (ii) motion at constant acceleration; (iii) harmonic motion.
The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II and Sec. III we provide the reader with a short review of the theory presented in Ref [40] and an introduction to the Telegraphic process. In Sec. IV we apply the theory to our model, presenting the results obtained for the stationary distribution and the corresponding moments. In Sec. V we investigate the first-passage properties of the system and their dependence on the return dynamics, by providing explicit expressions for the mean first-passage time. Finally, in Sec. VI we draw our conclusions and discuss the results.

II. MODEL: NONINSTANTANEOUS RESETTING
In this section we shortly review the model presented in [40] in order to provide the reader with the analytical tools that will be used throughout the paper. The process as a whole can be seen as a sequence of subprocesses. Each subprocess can be split in two phases: the displacement phase x(t), consisting in the stochastic dynamics of the diffusing particle, and the return phase, which occurs after the resetting event and consists in the deterministic motion to the resetting location. In the following we will always take x = 0 as both the starting point of the displacement phase and the resetting location. The duration  of the displacement phase, which corresponds to the time of the resetting event measured from the start of the subprocess, is a random variable drawn from a waiting time distribution with density ( ). The deterministic motion during the return phase is governed by the equation of motion x = (x0, ), hence its duration can be obtained by solving 0 =  (x0, ). The total duration of the subprocess is thus t =  + .

A. Duration of a subprocess

Let (t) be the probability density that the duration of the subprocess is t. The duration  of the displacement phase is ruled by the waiting time distribution for the resetting event ( ). At the time of the reset the particle occupies a random position x, with distribution p(x,  ), where p(x, t) is the probability density of the displacement phase. The duration  of the return phase is a deterministic function of this random position, hence we can write:



+

(t) = d ( )

dx [t -  - (x)] p(x,  ), (1)

0

-

where (·) denotes the Dirac delta function. We can eliminate the constraint of the delta function by defining the Laplace transform



^(s) =

e-st(t)dt,

(2)

0

and performing the integration over t:

+



^(s) =

dxe-s(x)

d e-s ( )p(x,  ). (3)

-

0

The probability that the n-th subprocess ends at time t is

t

n(t) = n-1(t)(t - t)dt,

(4)

0

which can be equivalently written in Laplace space as:

^n(s) =

^(s)

n
.

(5)

The total probability of starting a new subprocess at time t is defined by the renewal rate:



(t) = n(t).

(6)

n=1

Note that in the Laplace domain this becomes

^(s)

=

1

^(s) - ^(s)

,

(7)

hence for distribution possessing a well-defined first moment  such that in the small-s limit we can write ^(s)  1 - s, this equation yields ^(s)  1/s, where  is the mean duration of a subprocess. This means that in the long-time limit the renewal rate converges to a constant value:

lim (t)
t

=

1 

.

(8)

B. General form of the probability density function

In order to obtain the probability density function of
the position for the complete process, P (x, t), one can first define G(x, t), the density of the displacement for a
subprocess. Then P (x, t) can be expressed in terms of the probability that the last subprocess started at time t < t and has reached x in a time t - t:

t

P (x, t) = (t)G(x, t - t)dt.

(9)

0

Now we note that G(x, t) is the sum of two terms: Indeed, if no reset has occurred up to time t from the beginning of the subprocess, then the displacement density is simply given by p(x, t) and hence the corresponding contribution can be written as

G1(x, t) = p(x, t)(t),

(10)

where (t) denotes the probability that no resetting event has occurred up to time t:



(t) = (t)dt.

(11)

t

If instead the reset occurred at time  < t, then the pro-
cess stopped at a random position x0, whose distribution is p(x0,  ), and then started moving according to the deterministic law of motion x =  (x0, ). Therefore the corresponding term can be expressed as



+

G2(x, t) = d ( )

dx0p(x0,  )g2(x, t; x0,  ),

0

-

(12)

where g2(x, t; x0,  ) is:

g2(x, t; x0,  ) =  [x - (x0, t -  )] × (t -  )( +  - t). (13)

3

Here (x) is defined as follows:

(x) =

1 0

if x  0 if x < 0.

(14)

C. Stationary distribution

The stationary distribution is particularly easy to obtain if we consider situations in which the mean resetting time is finite [40]. Indeed, by writing Eq. (9) in Laplace space, one gets

P^(x,

s)

=

^(s)G^(x,

s)

=

^(s)G^(x, s) 1 - ^(s)

,

(15)

where we used Eq. (7). If we assume that as s approaches 0 we can write ^(s)  1 - s, then in the small-s limit

P^(x,

s)



1 s


G(x, t)dt,
0

(16)

from which one can deduce the following relation in the time domain:

lim P (x, t)
t

=

P (x)

=

1 

[1(x)

+ 2(x)] ,

(17)

where



1(x) = G1(x, t)dt

(18)

0



2(x) = G2(x, t)dt.

(19)

0

By using Eqs. (10) and (12) it is possible to obtain
more explicit formulas for the densities 1(x) and 2(x). For 1(x) we get:



1(x) = p(x, t)(t)dt.

(20)

0

For 2(x), we change the order of integration between t and  , and after the change of variable u = t- we write:



+

2(x) = d ( )

dx0p(x0,  )×

0

-



du [x - (x0, u)] (u)((x0) - u) (21)

-



+

= d ( )

dx0p(x0,  )×

0

-



du [x - (x0, u)] ((x0) - u),

(22)

0

where this time we have made explicit the dependence of  on x0. We now observe that the integration variable u here represents the time of the return phase, during which the distance of the particle from the origin is a

decreasing function of u. The delta function in the last integral hence provides a nonvanishing contribution only for |x|  |x0|, and the integral thus yields



du [x - (x0, u)] ((x0) - u) =

0

1
 |v(x0, x)|

for |x|  |x0|

(23)

0

for |x| > |x0|,

where |v(x0, x)| =

d(x0,x) du

is the speed of the particle

at position x. Therefore we find:





2(x) = d ( ) dx0×

0

|x|

 p(x0,  )



 

|v(x0

,

x)|

 p(-x0,  )   |v(-x0, x)|

for x  0 for x < 0.

(24)

Interestingly, it can be shown that if the ratio
1(x)/2(x) = K with K constant, then the stationary distribution is independent of the return motion [40].

III. THE TELEGRAPHIC PROCESS

The one-dimensional Telegraphic process may be defined as the mathematical equivalent of a particle moving at constant velocity c and randomly reversing the direction of motion from time to time at a fixed rate . If c0 is the initial velocity, then the state of the velocity at time t is

v(t) = c0(-1)N(t),

(25)

where N (t) is the number of events up to time t of a homogeneous Poisson process of rate . It follows the Kac's representation [41]:

t

t

x(t) = v(t)dt = c0 (-1)N(t)dt.

0

(26)

It turns out that the equation for the time evolution of

the probability density function p(x, t) of the process is

the so-called Telegrapher's equation [29]

2p t2

(27)

whose solution, relative to the initial conditions

p(x, 0) = (x),

p(x, t) t

0,

(28)

is [29]:

p(x, t)

(x - ct) + (x + ct)+

 c

I0(z)

+

tI1(z) z

(29)

4

where I0(z) and I1(z) are modified Bessel functions of the first kind [42] and z is the dimensionless variable defined
as

z

=

 c

c2t2 - x2.

(30)

Contrarily to the diffusion equation, the Telegrapher's equation contains the speed of the particle c as a parameter, implying that the probability density propagates in space with finite velocity. Indeed, the solution presented in Eq. (29) vanishes unless -ct  x  ct. However, note that we can still recover the diffusion equation if we take the limit c  ,   , with the ratio

c2 2

=

D

(31)

kept constant (diffusive limit). Indeed, one can show that the mean square displacement is [29]

x2(t)

=

c2 22

2t - 1 + e-2t

,

(32)

which grows linearly in time and reduces to x2(t) = 2Dt in the aforementioned limit. On the other hand, the limit   0 corresponds to a wave equation

2p t2

=

c2

2p x2

,

(33)

describing the deterministic motion at fixed c of a particle never reversing the velocity direction (ballistic limit ).
In the following we will need the Laplace transform of p(x, t), which can be obtained by first computing the probability density in Fourier-Laplace space. By defining



+

p~(k, s) =

dte-st

dke-ikxp(x, t),

(34)

0

-

plugging this expression into the Telegrapher's equation and considering the initial conditions specified by Eq. (28), one obtains

p~(k, s)

=

s(s

s + 2 + 2) +

c2k2

,

(35)

whose Fourier inversion is easy to perform, since p~(k, s) presents two simple imaginary poles:

k±

=

±

i c

s(s + 2).

(36)

Therefore, one finally gets:

p^(x, s) = + dk eikxp~(k, s) = s e-|x|s,

- 2

2s

(37)

with

s =

s(s + c

2)

.

(38)

IV. TELEGRAPHIC PROCESS AND POISSONIAN RESETTING

We now consider the Telegraphic process undergoing stochastic resetting and performing the return motion at constant velocity, constant acceleration and under the effect of a harmonic potential. The particle starts from x(0) = 0 randomly choosing the initial direction of motion, with equal probability. The position evolves according to Eq. (26). The dynamics is interrupted at a random time  by the resetting event, after which the particle starts moving towards the origin according to the deterministic equation of motion. When the origin is finally reached, the process is restored to the initial conditions and starts anew. Note that different resetting protocols for the initial state of the velocity can also be considered [30]. We will take Poissonian resetting, so that the distribution of the time interval between resetting events is exponential

( ) = re-r ,

(39)

where r is the resetting rate. It immediately follows that the probability of no resetting occurring in the time interval (0, t) is:



(t) = r

e-r d = e-rt.

(40)

t

A. Return motion at constant speed

Let v be the absolute value of the velocity. Then if the
particle is reset at position x0, its position during the return motion evolves according to

x(, x0) = -sgn(x0) · v + x0,

(41)

where sgn(·) denotes the sign of the argument. The time cost needed to return to the origin is thus:



=

|x0 v

|

.

(42)

A sample trajectory is represented in Fig. 1. The Laplace transform of the duration of a subprocess
can be computed from Eq. (3) by considering the return time given by Eq. (42), see Appendix A. We obtain

^(s) =

2 + r + s r + s cs + v

vr

, (43)

(2 + r + s)(r + s)

which yields the following value for the mean duration :



=

1 r

+

.

r(r + 2)

(44)

Note that since we are considering Poissonian resetting, the term 1/r is the mean duration of the displacement

phase, while the remaining term is the contribution of the return motion.
We now proceed with the computation of the stationary distribution. The contribution of the displacement phase is given by Eq. (20), from which we see that, in virtue of Eq. (40), the distribution 1(x) is expressed as the Laplace transform of p(x, t), with r playing the role of the Laplace variable. We thus have

1(x)

=

r e-|x|r , 2r

(45)

see Eqs. (37) and (38). The other contribution can in-

stead be written as

d e-r p(x0,  )

(47)

=

dx0p^(x0, r),
|x|

(48)

hence we easily get:

2(x)

=

e-|x|r 2v

.

(49)

The stationary distribution can be evaluated as

P (x)

=

1 

[1(x)

+

2(x)]

=

r e-|x|r , 2

(50)

which is independent of the return velocity, and indeed this is the same result obtained for instantaneous resetting [30, 31]. This observation regarding the Telegraphic process is not new to the literature [36]. One can compute the q-th moment of the distribution, obtaining

|x|q

= r


xq e-r x dx
0

=

(1 + qr

,

(51)

and in particular the mean square displacement is:

x2

=

2 2r

=

2c2 r(r + 2

)

.

(52)

B. Return motion at constant acceleration

We assume that when the deterministic return motion
starts, the initial velocity is v0 = 0. The dynamics is thus given by

 x(,

=

-sgn(x0)

·

+

x0

(53)

 v() = -sgn(x0) · a,

(54)

where a is the absolute value of the acceleration. The time needed to return to the origin from x0 is:

(x0) =

2|x0 a

|

.

Figure 2 displays a sample trajectory. In Appendix A we show that the Laplace transform of
the duration of a subprocess is

from which it follows that the mean duration is

(59)

2ar

In order to compute the stationary distribution, we first observe that the contribution of the displacement phase does not depend on the return motion, hence it has the same expression as before, given by Eq. (45). The contribution of the return phase instead depends on the velocity v(x0, x), which is:

v(x0, x) = 2a|x - x0|.

(60)

By considering Eq. (24) and dealing with the case x  0 (the case x < 0 follows from symmetry), we get


2(x) = r
x

p^(x0, 2a(x0

r) -

x) dx0

therefore the result valid for all x is:

r e-xr , (61) 8a

2(x) =

e-|x|r

.

(62)

It follows that the stationary distribution is

P (x)

=

1 

[1(x)

+

2(x)]

=

r 2

e-|x|r

,

(63)

which is once again independent of the particular kind of return motion, being independent of a. This is the same result obtained for the case of return at constant velocity. It is possible to show that a sufficient condition for the independence of the stationary distribution is that the velocity is a function of the distance |x - x0|:

v(x0, x) = v(x0 - x).

(64)

Indeed, if we take a closer look at Eq. (24), we realize that for the Telegraphic process undergoing Poissonian resetting we always have an expression of the kind

2(x)

=

r 2

 |x|

|v

dx0 (x0 ,

x)

|

e-x0

r

,

(65)

where

x0 = x0 · sgn(x).

(66)

By considering the change of variable y = x0 - |x|, we get

2(x)

=

r e-|x|r 2



dy

e-yr .

0 |v(y + x, x)|

(67)

therefore if the velocity is a function of the distance, the integral on the r.h.s does not depend on x and one always obtains:

2(x)

=

r 2

C

(r

)e-|x|r

,

(68)

where C(·) contains the parameters of the return motion. The stationary distribution is thus

P (x) =

1 r

+

C (r )

r 2

e-|x|r

,

(69)

but since C(r) does not depend on x, the normalization condition on P (x) implies:

+ -

P (x)dx

=

1

=

1 

1 r

+

C (r )

.

(70)

This shows that under such conditions, P (x) does not depend on the particular type or return dynamics and the stationary distribution is the same of the process with instantaneous resetting. This is displayed in Fig. 3: the stationary distribution and the moments obtained by evolving the process numerically do not depend on the return motion, and indeed the data obtained for the return at constant speed and acceleration agree.

C. Harmonic return motion

A sample trajectory depicting this situation is showed in Fig. 4. In this case, by assuming that the return
phase starts with v0 = 0, we have the following equation of motion:

x(x0, ) = x0 cos ()

(71)

v(x0, ) = -x0 sin () ,

(72)

where  is the radial frequency. The time to travel to the origin is a fixed value independent of the starting point



=

 2

,

(73)

so that the Laplace transform of the duration of a subprocess is easy to obtain, see Appendix A, and can also be inverted explicitly:

(t)

=

re-r(t-

 2

)

t

-

 2

.

(74)

The mean duration of a subprocess is trivially:



=

1 r

+

 2

.

(75)

The contribution 1(x) of the displacement phase to the stationary distribution is once again given by Eq.
(45). In order to compute 2(x) we first observe that the absolute value of the velocity can be written as

|v(x0, x)| =  x20 - x2,

(76)

therefore Eq. (24) yields, for all x:

2(x)

=

FIG. 3. (a)-(c) Stationary distribution of the process and (b)-(d) q-th moment in the case of return motion at constant speed, with v = 1, (a)-(b), and constant acceleration, with a = 1, (c)-(d). Panels (a) and (c) show the agreement of the numerical results with the stationary distribution, given by Eq. (50), for several resetting rates. Panels (b) and (d) display the time evolution of the q-th moment, compared with its stationary value, see Eq. (51). For all simulations, we took  = c = 1.

By considering the scaled variable y = x0/|x|, the integral can be written in terms of the modified Bessel func-
tion of the second kind of order 0 [42], and thus we get:

(79)

and we observe that P (x) this time depends on the return motion. Indeed, in this case the velocity is not a function
of the distance |x0 - x|; moreover, it is easy to check that the ratio 1(x)/2(x) is not a constant. We can now

compute the q-th moment. In particular we note that

Figure 5 shows the agreement of numerical simulations to the theoretical results. It is clear that the stationary distribution depends on the return dynamics, in particular on the radial frequency .

V. MEAN FIRST-PASSAGE TIME

Due to the constraint of a finite speed of propagation, the first-passage properties of the Telegraphic process are rather peculiar and show a much richer behavior with respect to those of Brownian motion. Let us consider a particle starting from the origin with equal probability of moving initially to the right or left, and suppose that a target is placed at position b > 0. Then the first-passage time distribution reads [44]:

f (b, t)

=

e- 2

where we called

.

(87)

From this expression, one obtains an infinite mean firstpassage time, as in the case of Brownian motion. However, contrarily to Brownian motion where, independently of the initial distance, for any t > 0 there is a finite

probability of hitting the target, for the Telegraphic process the probability vanishes for t < b/c. The standard
result is recovered in the diffusive limit, i.e., by taking both c   and   , with c2/2 = D kept constant.
By retaining only the leading terms in the asymptotic expansion of the Bessel functions one indeed finds:

In the opposite situation instead, i.e., in the ballistic limit   0, one may easily verify that only the term proportional to the delta function is nonvanishing, reflecting the fact that a wave propagating in the right direction with speed c surely hits the target at time t = b/c.
In order to study the first-passage properties of the process undergoing noninstantaneous Poissonian resetting, it is particular convenient to adopt the approach of Ref. [20]. Let us call a subprocess successful if the particle hits the target placed at b > 0 at time t during the displacement phase, and unsuccessful if the particle is reset to the initial position before reaching the target. Let us denote with F (t) the probability density of hitting the target for the first time at time t, (t) the probability density of hitting the target at time t after the start of the successful subprocess and (t) the probability density of the duration of an unsuccessful subprocess. Then F (t) is equal to the probability that the n-th unsuccessful ended at time t < t and the target is then reached in a time t - t, summed over all possible values of n:

t

F (t) = (t) +

dt (t - t) n (t) ,

(89)

n=1 0

where n(t) is the probability density of ending the n-th unsuccessful subprocess at time t. This equation can be
written more conveniently in Laplace space

F^(s)

=


^ (s) ^n(s)
n=0

=

1

^ (s) - ^(s)

,

(90)

from which one is able to obtain the mean first-passage time as:

T

=

-

dF^(s) ds

s=0

=

-

1

^ (0) - ^(0)

-

^ (0)^(0) 1 - ^(0) 2

.

(91)

Note that the quantities we have defined thus far also depend on the position of the target, but we drop the dependence in order to have cleaner expressions.
The probability (t) is equal to the first-passage probability of the displacement phase, which we denote as f (t), times the probability of not having been reset up to time t. Thus we can write for the Laplace transform ^ (s)



^ (s) =

e-st(t)f (t)dt,

FIG. 5. (a) Stationary distribution of the process and (b) q-th moment in the case of return motion under the effect of a harmonic potential. Panel (a) shows the agreement of the numerical results with the stationary distribution, given by Eq. (79), for a few . Data have been shifted to enhance the readability of the plot. Panel (b) displays the time evolution of the q-th moment, compared with its stationary value, see Eq. (83). In this case all data are obtained by fixing  = 10. For all simulations, we took  = c = 1.

meaning that for Poissonian resetting, i.e., (t) = exp(-rt), the Laplace transform is simply equal to:

^ (s) = f^(s + r).

(93)

We observe that ^ (s) only depends on f^(s), which is a property of the displacement phase. In the case of the Telegraphic process the function f^(s) is [30, 44]:

f^(s)

=

1 2

s + 2 -

s(s + 2) e-bs ,

(94)

where s is defined by Eq. (38). The duration of an unsuccessful subprocess instead can be expressed as



b

(t) = d ( ) dx [t -  - (x)] q(x,  ), (95)

0

-

where q(x, t) is the survival probability density function, namely, the PDF of being at position x at time t and having not hit the target up to time t. The corresponding Laplace transform then can be computed in the following way:

b



^(s) =

dxe-s(x)

d e-s ( )q(x,  ), (96)

-

0

where (x) is the time needed to return to the origin from x, determined by the law of the return motion. We observe that for exponential resetting, (t) = r exp(-rt), the result of the time integration can be written in terms of q^(x, s):

b

^(s) = r

e-s(x)q^(x, s + r)dx.

(97)

-

The computation of q(x, t) for the Telegraphic process is a challenging problem, because the standard method of the images [45] used in the case of Brownian motion does not yield the correct result. This is due to finite-memory effects of the driving noise, see the discussion in the introduction of Ref. [46]. When approaching the problem from the point of view of the Fokker-Planck equation, one has to deal with nontrivial boundary conditions [47]. The solution is considered for example in Refs. [46, 48] and we present our derivation in Appendix B, wherein we obtain:

q^(x, s) =

s 2s

e-s |x|

-

s 2s

(s

-

cs)

e-s(2b-x).

(98)

This expression can be inserted in Eq. (97) to compute ^(s) after we specify the return motion and determine
the return time (x). Note that by integrating Eq. (98)
one gets the survival probability in Laplace space:

b

Q^(b, s) =

q^(x, s)dx

-

=

1 s

-

1 2s

(s

-

cs) e-bs .

(99) (100)

Furthermore, by using the following relation between the survival and first passage probability f^(b, s):

f^(b, s) = 1 - sQ(b, s),

(101)

we also get

f^(b, s)

=

1 2

(s + 2

- cs) e-bs ,

(102)

which is indeed the Laplace transform of Eq. (85). In the following we present our results for the three cases of return motion previously considered.

10

A. Return motion at constant speed

In this case the return time is

(x)

=

|x| v

,

(103)

where v is the speed. By inserting (x) in Eq. (97) and using the expression of the survival probability, Eq. (98), we compute the distribution of the duration of an unsuccessful subprocess in Laplace space, ^(s), see Appendix C. The distribution ^ (s) can be evaluated immediately from Eqs. (93) and (94), from which we obtain ^ (0):

^ (0)

=

e-

b c


r (r +2 )

,

(104)

where

R=

r + 2 - r(r + 2)

We can compute the first derivative as well, obtaining:

^ (0) =

R 2

-

(r

+

)

e-

b c


r (r +2 )

.

R r(r + 2)

(106)

From these results and Eq. (91) it follows that the mean first-passage time is:

, (107)

where w is the dimensionless variable

w

=

r(r + 2).

(108)

We observe that in the limit v  , the second term vanishes and we recover the result for instantaneous resetting [30].
It is useful to evaluate this expression in the diffusive and ballistic limits. The first one is recovered for R  1, which yields

T

=

+

2 sinh w w

-

(109)

where in this case w is defined as

w=b

r D

.

(110)

This is indeed the result obtained in Ref. [40]. It also interesting to check the opposite limit, which is recovered for R  2. One gets

T

(2ew

+

c v

-

b v

(111)

with

w

.

(112)

In Fig. 6 we represent the mean first-passage time of the process, described by Eq. (107), for a few values of the return speed. We also present the same observable in the ballistic regime, expressed by Eq. (111). Both are compared with numerical simulations, showing good agreement with the theoretical behavior for all the considered values of the resetting rate. We observe that for  > 0 (left panel) the optimal rate drifts toward higher values as the return speed increases, while in the ballistic regime it remains approximately constant. Furthermore, the effect of the return speed is much more important when  = 0 (right panel). Remarkably, in the finite- regime, if one considers very low return speeds, the theoretical curve becomes almost flat for a wide range of resetting rates.

B. Return motion at constant acceleration

The return time is given by

(x) =

2|x| a

,

(113)

where a is the absolute value of the acceleration. The Laplace transform ^(s) can be then computed, yielding
the expression reported in Appendix C. Equations (104) and (106) yield the value of ^ (0) and ^ (0), respectively,
hence we obtain the following mean first-passage time:

Also in this case, we can recover the result of instantaneous resetting by taking the limit a  . In the diffusive limit, from the previous expression we obtain

(b) The corresponding mean first-passage time in the ballistic regime. In both cases, the dashed black curves represent the situation of instantaneous resetting.

(119)

see Appendix C, while ^ (0) and ^ (0) are still defined as in the previous cases. A straightforward computation leads to

T=

+

(Rew - 1) ,

(120)

and the corresponding results for the diffusive and ballistic limit are simply recovered by setting R = 1 or R = 2 in the previous expression, and using the correct definition of w, given by Eq. (110) and Eq. (112), respectively. Furthermore, the limit    yields the result of instantaneous resetting. Figure 8 displays the difference between the  > 0 and  = 0 regimes. In both cases, the numerical data show good agreement with the theoretical predictions. As it can be deduced from Eq. (120), the mean first-passage time is less influenced by the return motion for low values of the resetting rate. Finally, we point out that in the ballistic regime the optimal r shows a more noticeable dependence on the return dynamics with respect to the previous two cases.

time cost needed to perform the return is correlated with the position at which the resetting occurs. This leads to interesting consequences regarding the first-passage properties and the distribution of the process. In the present work, we have considered three kinds of return motion: (i) return at constant speed, (ii) constant acceleration and (iii) under the effect of a harmonic potential.
Returns at constant speed and acceleration display, in a sense, an opposite behavior with respect to returns performed under the action of a harmonic potential. Indeed, in the former case the stationary distribution reached by the process is independent of the return dynamics, so that one obtains the same result of the standard situation with instantaneous resetting; in the latter case instead, the return law provides important contributions to the resulting stationary state, which is indeed evidently different from the aforementioned result. Furthermore, when one investigates the first-passage properties, it becomes clear that returns at constant speed and acceleration modify the mean first-passage time in a highly nontrivial way, while if the returns are performed under the effect of a harmonic potential, since the time cost to return is constant, the first-passage properties are less sensitive to the return dynamics and one observes a non-negligible effect only for high values of the resetting rate.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have considered the one-dimensional Telegraphic process undergoing stochastic Poissonian resetting. Unlike the standard description of models with resetting, the return to the initial location is performed according to a deterministic law of motion, so that the

We think that our work may be useful for those situations where it has been recognized that the Telegraphic process provides a more suitable description with respect to Brownian motion, e.g., the run-and-tumble dynamics of Escherichia coli bacteria, in which some sort of resetting mechanism must be taken into account and for which the time cost to return can not be neglected.

Appendix A: Laplace transform of the subprocess duration

In order to evaluate the Laplace transform of the duration of a subprocess, Eq. (3) in the main text, a preliminary computation requires the solution of the integral:

and more explicit expressions can be obtained once we specify the deterministic motion. In the case of returns at constant speed we have

so that the integration is straightforward and it is left to the reader. In the case of returns at constant acceleration we have

Appendix B: Survival PDF for the Telegraphic process
It is convenient to begin with the discrete description of the Telegraphic process provided by the model of the persistent random walk [29]. Let us consider a particle moving with nearest-neighbor jumps on a discrete lattice. Each jumps is performed in a time t with speed c,

14

so that the lattice spacing is x = ct; suppose that at each step there is a probability r of reversing the direction of motion and a probability t = 1 - r of jumping in the same direction of the previous step. Call R(x, t) the probability of being at position x = ix, i  Z, at time t = nt, n  N, with momentum directed to the right, and L(x, t) the corresponding probability for momenta directed to the left. Then R(x, t) and L(x, t) obey the following evolution equations [50]:

R(x, t + t) = tR(x - ct, t) + rL(x + ct, t) (B1) L(x, t + t) = tL(x + ct, t) + rR(x - ct, t). (B2)

Now suppose that an absorbing barrier is placed at b > 0, so that no particle can arrive from b + ct. By evaluating the dynamics at the boundary, the previous system reduces to

R(b, t + t) = tR(b - ct, t) L(b, t + t) = rR(b - ct, t).

(B3) (B4)

The evolution equations of the Telegraphic process can be recovered from Eqs. (B1) and (B2) by performing the continuum limit. We consider infinitesimal time steps, t  dt, set

R(x, t)  r(x, t)dx L(x, t)  l(x, t)dx,

(B5) (B6)

and scale the transmission probability as [29]

t = 1 - dt,

(B7)

which corresponds to Poissonian statistics with rate  for the velocity reversals. These choices lead to the system of equations

r(x, t + dt) = (1 - dt) r(x - cdt, t) + dt l(x + cdt, t) l(x, t + dt) = (1 - dt) l(x + cdt, t) + dt r(x - cdt, t),

accompanied by the following dynamics at the boundary:

r(b, t + dt) = (1 - dt) r(b - cdt, t) l(b, t + dt) = dt r(b - cdt, t).

(B8) (B9)

Equation (B9) imposes that l(b, t) vanishes in the limit dt  0, hence by Taylor expanding the evolution equations for r(x, t) and l(x, t) we obtain in such a limit the following system of partial differential equations:

r t

=

-c

r x

-  (r

-

l)

l t

=

c

l x

+



(r

-

l)

,

(B10) (B11)

subject to the boundary condition

l(b, t) = 0.

(B12)

In order to solve the problem, we introduce the functions q = r +l and w = r -l, and write the corresponding

equations which are obtained by summing and subtracting (B10) and (B11):

q t

=

-c

w x

w t

=

-c

q x

-

2

w.

(B13) (B14)

The function q(x, t) just defined is the survival PDF. The boundary condition on l(x, t) corresponds to a boundary condition on q(x, t). Note that since l(x, t) vanishes at the boundary, it follows from their definition that q(b, t) and w(b, t) are equal. Therefore, by evaluating Eq. (B14) at x = b and putting w(b, t) = q(b, t) we obtain the boundary condition for q(x, t):

2 q(b, t) +

q(b, t) t

+c

q(x, t) x

x=b

=

0.

(B15)

One can show that the system of coupled equations (B13) and (B14) can be transformed in a system of decoupled Telegrapher's equations [29]. Hence the function q(x, t) is the solution of the problem:

 2q

q(b, t) t

q(x, t) x

0.

(B16) (B17) (B18)
(B19)

This may be solved in Laplace space, by seeking solutions q^(x, s) which are linear combinations of the free problem and moreover satisfy the boundary condition. Hence we put

q^(x, s) = p^(x, s) + A(s)e-s(2b-x),

(B20)

where

p^(x, s)

=

s 2s

e-|x|s

,

s =

s(s + c

2

)

,

(B21)

is the solution of the free problem, while the other term does not yield contributions in the interval (-, b] for t < b/c. The boundary condition in Laplace space is

(s + 2) q^(b, s) + c

q^(x, s) x

x=b

= 0,

(B22)

hence by plugging our ansatz into this equation we get the expression for the unknown coefficient A(s):

A(s)

=

-

s 2s

(s

-

cs)

.

(B23)

As a double check, we can compute the total survival probability we obtain from this expression. It is easy to

which is indeed the survival probability already obtained in the literature [30, 44].

Appendix C: Laplace transform of the duration of an unsuccessful subprocess

The Laplace transform of the duration of an unsuccessful subprocess can be computed from Eq. (97) of the main text:

b

^(s) = r

e-s(x)q^(x, s + r)dx,

-

(C1)

where

q^(x, s)

(C2)

and (x) depends on the return motion. We recall that s is defined as:

s =

s(s + c

2)

.

In the following, it is convenient to define the variable

(C3)

p = s + r.

(C4)

In the case of returns at constant speed v, the return time is (x) = |x|/v and thus we get:

^(s) =

rp /p

-

p+ -cp 

e-2bp

.

(s/v + p) (s/v - p)

For the returns at constant acceleration a, we have (x) = 2|x|/a. By defining the variables

w = bp = s ,
2ap

and the function we can write the Laplace transform as:

F (z) = 2

Appendix D: Simulation method

In order to perform the simulations of the Telegraphic process, we took advantage of Kac's representation

t
x(t) = c0 (-1)N(t)dt,
0

(D1)

where N (t) is the number of events up to time t of a homogeneous Poisson process of rate . It follows that

16

for small time steps dt we can write

x(t + dt)  x(t) + c0dt · (-1)N(t).

(D2)

Instead of considering N (t), we can took instead a signal (t) switching between the values 0 and 1 with rate . In other words, the probability that (t) changes state in

the time interval (t, t + dt) is dt, and the position in all our simulations was evolved according to:

xj+1 = xj + c0dt · (-1)(t).
