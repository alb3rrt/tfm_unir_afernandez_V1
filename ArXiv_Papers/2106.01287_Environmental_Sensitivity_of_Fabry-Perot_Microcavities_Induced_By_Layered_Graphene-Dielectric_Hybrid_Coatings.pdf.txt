We propose a novel fiber-based environmental sensor that exploits the reflection phase shift tunability provided by the use of layered coatings composed of dielectric slabs spaced by conducting membranes. A transfer matrix study is done in a simplified theoretical model, for which an enhanced sensitivity of the reflection interference pattern to the output medium is demonstrated, in the typical refractive index range of liquid media. An experimental configuration using a cascaded FabryPerot microcavity coated by a graphene oxide/polyethylenimine (GO/PEI) multilayered structure is demonstrated. Its cost effective chemical production method makes graphene oxide-based hybrid coatings excellent candidates for future real-life sensing devices.

I. INTRODUCTION
One of the main technological application of optical fibers is to fabricate sensing devices that can detect the tiniest changes in physical or chemical parameters. Such measurements can be very precise but are usually indirect and exploit the effect of small parametric changes in the propagation of guided lightwaves. The accuracy of these sensors relies on interferometry that is made possible, for instance, by building hollow core microcavities (as small as 30µm [1, 2]) using capillary tubes or photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) at end of a cleaved optical fiber [1, 3­17], that act as miniature Fabry-Perot interferometers. FabryPerot cavities in optical fibers were firstly fabricated by Sirkis et al. for strain measurement [3] and, since then, similar interferometric sensors have been proposed for curvature [12], temperature [11], pressure [5], humidity [15], acoustic sensing [17], among others. Besides, fiber optic sensors based on Fabry-Perot interferometers have also attracted much attention in other fields of expertise,

ranging from medicine [10] to engineering [4, 6].
The periodicity of the interference fringes can be made dependent on the refractive index of the environment (nout). This can be achieved by endowing the output interface with a reflection phase shift variable with the wavelength (), an effect that can be produced by a thin coating which may feature an internal layered structure built at the nanoscale [18]. Different kinds of coatings have been used over the years, including dielectric multilayered structures [19­21], porous metal-oxide films [22] and metallic coatings based on thin metal films [23, 24], plasmonic nanostructures [25] or embedded nanoparticles [26, 27]. More recently, it has been reported [28] that hybrid structures made of dielectrics and very thin (but highly conducting) metallic films can show nontrivial internal interference effects that allow for an effective control over the phase shift introduced upon reflection of light. With the advent of graphene [29, 30] and other atomically thin planar conductors (ATPC), it became possible to apply this same concept in hybrid optical coatings comprised of dielectric-ATPC-dielectric multilayered structures. In effect, if two-dimensional graphene precursors are employed, such hybrid coatings can be produced by using layer-by-layer chemical methods [31, 32], that take advantage

2

of intermolecular interactions between oppositely charged electrolytes to self-assemble a multilayered structure [33]. This inexpensive thin-film assembly already proved to be a viable technique for real-life optical sensors of pH [34], oxygen detection [35] and fluorescence [36].
In this paper, we propose a novel fiber-based environmental sensor that consists of a Fabry-Perot microcavity coated by a hybrid structure made of dielectric polymer slabs separated by conducting two-dimensional membranes. This sensor makes use of the aforementioned nontrivial interference effects inside hybrid coatings, significantly enhanc- 
 ing the sensitivity of the reflection interference fringes to the output refractive index, in a range typical of liquid media. For concreteness, our theoretical analysis considers the conducting membranes to be pristine graphene sheets, whose optical conductivity is real and roughly -independent in the mid- to near-infrared range [37­39] (in the sensor's operation regime). However, the precise nature of these membranes is insubstantial and the conclusions presented here only require them to be two-dimensional materials with sufficiently large real optical conductivities. Hence, more practical realizations of these devices can use hybrid optical coatings based on graphene-oxide (GO) sheets [40­ 42], instead of actual graphene monolayers. As referred, layered structures based on these graphene precursors can be grown by inexpensive chemical processes in controlled layer-by-layer [32, 33, 43] procedures. Here, we employ this technique to experimentally realize the proposed sensor in a cascaded Fabry-Perot interferometer at the tip of a single-mode fiber, that was coated by stacked polyethyleneimine/graphene-oxide (PEI/GO) layers.
The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we review the optical properties of pristine graphene and highlight the similarities with existing studies on GO lattices. In Sec. III, we devise our theoretical model for the sensor, as well as the transfer matrix formalism used to investigate the reflection properties of the hybrid dielectric-ATPC-dielectric coatings, as a function of the output refractive index and the system's parameters. We also present the theory of interference in a low-finesse FabryPerot cavity, which is a key ingredient to understand the physics behind the sensor's operation. In Sec. IV, we present our main theoretical predictions regarding the operation and performance of our idealized environmental sensor. We also point out the chief advantages of using graphene-

V, including measurements that demonstrate the operation predicted by our theoretical analysis. Finally, in Sec. VI, we sum up our conclusions and speculate on future applications of this technology.
II. OPTICAL RESPONSE OF GRAPHENE AND GRAPHENE-OXIDE
The crucial ingredient of this sensor is the possibility to coat the outward surface of the Fabry-Perot microcavity by a layered structure of dielectric slabs interfaced by conducting twodimensional membranes. As explained in the introduction, the detailed nature of these membranes is not important for our conclusions, which only depend on a dissipative optical response, that is sufficiently strong but weakly dependent on the wavelength. In other words, the membrane must behave as a two-dimensional metal in the sensor's operational range (i.e., the mid- to near-infrared spectral range). Nevertheless, the simplest albeit paradigmatic example of such a material is monolayer graphene, whose optical response will be concisely reviewed here. In addition, recent studies on the optical response of (more complicated) GO will also be referred, highlighting the similarities with graphene that justify a direct comparison between theory and experiments is this paper.
When working around the near- to mid-infrared regime ( 800nm), it is known that the linear optical response of graphene is isotropic (xx = yy =  are the only non-zero terms of the conductivity tensor) and well described by continuum limit calculations done within a low-energy model having two uncoupled Dirac-cones [37, 44, 45]. More realistic modeling was also done [46­48] and confirm this approximation as appropriate. Under this approximation, the low temperature optical conductivity of graphene can be shown to have two con-

where  is a phenomenological scattering parameter, c is the speed of light in the vaccum, h is Planck's constant and EF is the Fermi energy of graphene. For this approximate calculations to hold, one must always consider that |EF| 0.3eV, corresponding to a slightly doped graphene monolayer. In Fig. 2, we show some representative plots of these conductivities where it is evident that 2|EF| acts as an effective "optical gap" that marks a boundary between two response regimes. For  >  c/|EF|, the dissipative inter-band response is suppressed by Pauli-blocking and a mostly reactive current appears on the system. In contrast, for  <  c/|EF|, the imaginary part of the conductivity is almost zero and the response is mostly due to inter-band transitions. Then, the optical response of graphene becomes purely dissipative with a -independent universal conductivity [38]. The latter is the regime where our sensor proposal will operate, such that we may take the optical conductivity to be   e2/4 .
As noted in the introduction, although pristine graphene could be used to realize our proposal, cheaper and more practical alternatives are provided by other two-dimensional materials, such as graphene-oxide monolayers. These functionalized versions of graphene have considerably more complex structures [41] and simple expressions cannot be readily obtained for their electronic or optical response properties. However, due to its interest for optoelectronic applications [49], many Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies have been published on the linear optical properties of oxidized graphene sheets [42, 50­52]. Most of the results demonstrate that, at least for moderately oxidized graphene, the optical conductivity retains a purely dissipative plateau in the mid-infrared [52] with a value that departs from the universal conductivity found in pristine graphene. Based on this, we

argue that the theory we will develop for coatings based off pristine graphene membranes, also holds for GO, provided the value of the universal optical conductivity is adjusted as a phenomenological parameter.

III. THEORETICAL MODEL FOR THE
PROPOSED SENSOR
We propose a fiber-based interferometric sensor (see Fig. 1a) that operates on the basis of a reflection interference pattern that is sensitive to its environment. Any changes in physical or chemical properties of this surrounding medium typically translate into slight alterations on its refractive index. For a bare output interface, the sensor would only be affected by variations in the absolute reflectivity of the last interface, as the phase introduced upon reflection is independent [53] of the incident wavelength. This implies that the interference pattern in the reflected spectrum will be affected solely in the relative strength of its Fourier components, but not in their periods. To allow a shift in the fringe periods by environmental changes, one must engineer the output interface so as to give it a -dependent complex reflection coefficient that also depends parametrically on the refractive index of the output medium. Such properties can be embedded into the optical interface by deposing a nano-structured coating onto the cavity's outwards surface, as described in the introduction.
Here, we present the basic theoretical model employed to simulate the operation of our device proposal. Before proceeding with details, it is important to highlight that the sensor is naturally split into two main parts: i) the hybrid coating

on the output interface and ii) the Fabry-Perot microcavity at fiber's termination. Both components work together to produce the interference effects on which the sensor is based, however they act at different length scales. The hybrid coating is structured at the nanoscale, with typical distances of  10nm between successive conducting membranes. These lengths are shorter than optical wavelengths and thus responsible for the internal interference that causes nontrivial phase shifts upon reflection. In addition, one also has the optical interfaces forming the Fabry-Perot microcavity. These surfaces are distanced by tens/hundreds of µm, scales that far exceed the ones present in the internals of the hybrid coating. The purpose of this cavity is simply to generate a basic threewave interference pattern in the reflected spectrum which will then be shaped by variations in the output refractive index. In the following, we shall consider these two main parts separately.
A. Optical Modeling of a Hybrid
Nano-structured Coating
The layer-by-layer assembly method creates optical coatings where several (roughly parallel) conducting membranes are separated by nanoscopic slabs of identical dielectric material. In practice, the control over orientation, flatness and distances between sheets is not perfect but, for a modeling purpose, we shall consider the conducting membranes as mutually parallel planes as shown in Fig. 3a. Moreover, since our proposal is based on a single-mode optical fiber, it is appropriate to consider that the guided light-wave has normal incidence on the coating, which simplifies the following calculations. In short, our aim will be to evaluate the complex reflection/transmission coefficients of a hybrid coating featuring a given number (N ) of conducting membranes spaced by a set of dielectric slabs characterized by the widths, {d1,· · ·, dN-1}. This problem can be neatly solved by a Transfer Matrix Method (TMM). With no loss of generality, we consider the membranes to be pristine graphene monolayers working at the universal optical conductivity regime, i.e.   1500nm, while the dielectric slabs will be taken as made up of the same material (of refractive index npol).
To devise a TMM that evaluates the complex transmission (t) and reflection coefficients (r) of the entire coating, we begin by considering a monochromatic wave at normal incidence onto a single conducting plane (depicted in Fig. 3b). In this case, both the electric and magnetic fields are

parallel to the graphene sheet and the solution of the four-wave scattering problem boils down to imposing appropriate boundary conditions at the interface. Since the interface is conducting, it supports surface currents driven by the electric field of the crossing wave which, in turn, alter the usual boundary conditions associated to a purely dielectric interface. The general electromagnetic boundary conditions in the presence of a surface conductivity are derived in the Appendix A. Meanwhile, the electric field of the partial waves in Fig. 3b can be written as

Since the wave is at normal incidence, all the

fields involved are parallel to the conducting inter-

face. This leads to two important simplifications

in the boundary conditions at z = 0: i) Only the

conditions on field components parallel to the sur-

face are of importance; and ii) Despite generating

surface currents, the time-varying electric fields do

not induce any superficial charge density waves. In

Having the linear relation of Eq. (8), it is triv-

ial to generalize the result and relate the input to

the output field components in the whole struc-

ture of Fig. 3b. For that, we recognize that a com-

plex phase factor -- exp (±i2nidi/) -- is accumulated by right- and left-traveling components,

respectively, when traversing the dielectric slab

between layers i and i+1. Hence, the electric field

amplitudes at the input and output media can be

related as

where T is a 2×2 transfer matrix characterizing the transmission of a monochromatic electromag-

trix is defined in terms of the interface matrices --

TGi,i+1() -- defined in Eq. (9), and the matrices -- Pi = diag (exp (i2nidi/) , exp (-i2nidi/)) --
describing the phase-accumulation in each dielec-

tric slab. The general expression then reads,

T= TG0,1()·P1·TG1,2()· · · · ·PN-1·TGN-1,N(), (11)
where n0 = nin and nN = nout. Before moving on, it is worthy to remark that
the TMM is suitable for extremely efficient numerical evaluation, involving only successive product of very small (2 × 2) matrices. In our case, by specifying nin, nout, the list of dielectric widths {d1, · · · , dN-1} and the corresponding refractive indices {n1, · · · , nN-1}, the transfer matrix of the whole coating can be computed in a matter of

Recapping, the TMM provides a convenient and

fast method to evaluate the reflection coefficient of

an hybrid coating, having any number of conduct-

ing membranes with given interlayer separations,

and functioning at a given wavelength. Hence, in

what follows we may take r as a known quantity, which one can readily evaluate for a specific case,

and that fully characterizes the reflection proper-

ties of the output coated surface.

B. Reflection Interference Pattern in a Three-Wave Fabry-Perot Cavity

Besides the sub-wavelength processes within the hybrid coating, there is also interference happening at larger scales, between the waves reflected off the three interfaces that make up the low-finesse Fabry-Perot microcavity at the fiber's termination (see cartoon in Fig. 1). Dealing with this µm-scale interference is not fundamentally different from our previous analysis. However, in the interest of earning a greater insight on the sensor's operation, we approach the problem at a different angle and approximate the reflected signal by the sum of the three primary reflections (the ones shown in Fig. 1). This approximation is justified by the

6

low reflectivity of all the surfaces in the cavity and further confirmed by a direct comparison with the reflected spectra obtained by the TMM applied to the whole system (see Fig. 4). Considering as three-wave approximation, the intensity reflected by the microcavity is then given as

where ns is the refractive index of the silica, d and D are the cavity widths (as defined in Fig. 1), and I1,2,3 are the intensities reflected by each interface. These intensities can be obtained from

and

As anticipated, effects from the output coating in the interference pattern are encapsulated in its complex reflection coefficient, specified by the corresponding reflectivity (Rc) and reflection phase shift (c) in all previous expressions. These parameters are crucially dependent on the incident wavelength () and can be calculated by the TMM described in Subsect. III. As we shall see, the dependence of the reflection phase shift plays a pivotal role in the operation of our sensor and is, in effect, the central concept of this paper.
Regardless of coating details, one can point out some generic features of the interference fringes. As evident from Eq. (13), even within a three-wave approximation, a Fabry-Perot interferometer does not yield a periodic interference pattern upon reflection. Nevertheless, if only a small neighborhood of a central wavelength (c) is observed, one can consider a lowest-order expansion around c and a three-component periodic pattern emerges,

This pattern features three effective periods (1,2,3) that arise from the interference of any combination of the three partial waves of Fig. 1. The three periods are then given as:

and 3 =

With no surprise, Eqs. (16) demonstrate that the effect of coating the output interface is a slight change in 2 and 3, relative to their bare values. These are the components of the pattern which arise from interference with the partial wave reflected off the output interface. Interestingly, they also show that the shift in the periods is due to a dependent reflection phase shift, something which would be absent in a bare dielectric-to-dielectric interface. These shifts may increase (positive response) or a decrease (negative response) the periods relative to their bare values, depending on the sign of / dc d c . As we shall see, both the sign and magnitude of this derivative can be tuned by changes in the refractive index of the output medium, thus providing the operational principle behind the cavity's sensitivity to the environment. Note that, in practice, the individual periods of the interference pattern can be studied by bandfiltering the Fourier transform of the reflected signal within a narrow enough spectral window [55].

IV. NONTRIVIAL REFLECTION PHASE
SHIFTS AND ENHANCED RESPONSE TO
LIQUID ENVIRONMENTS
The dependence of the reflected interference fringes on the output medium is determined by the phase shifts introduced when the wave is reflected off the last interface of the microcavity. More precisely, Eqs. (16) show that a -dependent phase shift changes the periods in the interference pattern, with respect to their bare values (determined by the microcavity's geometry). If the tip of the sensor was a bare dielectric-to-dielectric interface, then the reflection dephasing would be independent of both  and nout. In this case, any changes to the periodicity of the fringes could only arise by geometrical alterations of the microcavity itself. However, such situation does not hold if a thin dielectric coating (of index npol and width ) is placed on top of the output surface. Then, interference within the coating can bring about nontrivial phase shifts on the last partial wave, that

usually depend on the wavelength. A straightforward transfer matrix analysis of this simple setup reveals the following complex reflection coefficient:

(17)

From Eq. (17), one extracts the reflectivity and

reflection phase shift as functions of the incident

wavelength. For our purposes, what really matters

is to analyze the variation of these quantities with

nout, provided the coating is nearly anti-reflecting (i.e.   npol/2). In Fig. 5a, we present such an analysis for a dielectric coating (npol = 1.6), near anti-reflecting conditions, i.e. with the parameter

x = 2npol/ valued close to 1. The main feature to be highlighted happens for nout = nout  ns, when the absolute reflectivity of the output sur-

face vanishes and is accompanied by an abrupt

("resonant-like") behavior of dc/d c. Intuitively, this behavior signals that, even for a coating with

precise dimensions for destructive interference of

the backscattered waves (i.e. x = 1), the interfer-

ence is only partial unless the reflectivity is similar

on both ends of the coating. This implies opposite

discontinuities of the refractive index in the two in-

terfaces. If the dimensions of the coating slightly

depart from this /2-condition (or x  1) then a

nonzero reflectivity is obtained, accompanied by

a broadening of the "resonant-like" response of

dc/d c to nout (as depicted in Fig. 5a). The "resonant-like" behavior described above is

of the utmost importance for this work. In fact,

Eqs. (16) directly imply that such a strong depen-

dence of dc/d con nout leads to an enhanced sensitivity of the periods in the interference fringes,

to the environment in which the Fabry-Perot mi-

crocavity is placed. In passing, it is also relevant

to note that dc/d c increases with nout in this regime, meaning that the periods of the interfer-

ence fringes would have a negative environmen-

tal response. However, as the closing of the mi-

crocavity is always silica (ns  1.45), any purely dielectric coating would only enhance its environ-

mental sensitivity for refractive indices nout  1.45, which are typical of transparent solid media. In or-

der to operate this sensor on fluid environments,

one must be able to shift this "resonant-like" be-

havior towards lower values of nout. As will be demonstrated, this is the advantage of using a

hybrid coating with embedded conducting mem-

branes, instead of a dielectric one.

Inside a hybrid coating there are conducting

membranes that act as segmentations of the bulk

dielectric 30matrix in which lie embedded. Effec-

faces greatly affect the profile of a wave traveling inside, as they introduce additional internal reflections and also localized dissipation of field energy. The TMM devised in Sec. III takes all these effects into account and, as shown in Fig. 5b, they lead to a non-homogeneous field intensity that decreases along the width of the coating. This deformation of the field profile leads to a change in the condition for the absence of a reflected wave, thus requiring a larger discontinuity in the refractive index at the output boundary. As shown in Fig. 5c, the main consequence is a downshift of nout which now enhances the environmental sensitivity at refractive indices within the range of 1.3-1.4.
Before moving on to the experimental proofof-concept, it is important to recognize that the shift in nout depends on the parameters of the coating. Namely, we show in Fig. 5c that nout decreases monotonically with the number of conducting membranes, provided the full width of the coating is kept roughly the same. Instead of looking at the resonance, the changes in nout can be conveniently and fully characterized by tracking the reflectivity minimum. According to our previ-

ous interpretation of this "resonance-like" behavior, a minimum in the reflectivity must always accompany the resonance in dc/d c. This analysis is done in Fig. 6a and, for low enough conductivity of the membranes, the minima depend on the coating parameters as,

nout=

,

(18)

where ns is the refractive index of silica, µ0 the vaccum magnetic permeability, c the speed of light and N the total number of conducting membranes. Finally, this expression can be used to create approximate calibration curves (see Fig. 6b) that serve to guide the engineering of a coating configuration that is appropriate to enhance the environmental sensitivity around a pre-established value of the output refractive index.

V. EXPERIMENTAL DEMONSTRATION
The theoretical proposal made in previous sections is now put to the test on experimental grounds. Our prototypical device consists of a single-mode optical fiber (SMF) terminated by a cascaded Fabry-Perot microcavity interferometer (FPMI). A photograph, obtained from an optical microscope, is shown in Fig. 7. In order to assess the influence of an hybrid coating on the environmental sensitivity of its interference pattern, we perform a comparative study using two sensing devices: i) an FPMI sensor coated by a single layer of bulk dielectric polymer and ii) a similar sensor having a multilayered PEI/GO hybrid coating.
In the following, we begin by detailing technical aspects of the device's production method and measurement techniques. Afterwards, we present experimental measurements and compare them to the predictions of our theoretical framework.
1. Fabrication of the Fabry-Perot Microcavity Interferometer
To build the FPMI, a silica capillary tube with an internal (external) diameter of 75µm (125µm) was fusion spliced (Sumitomo Type-72C) to the SMF's termination and then cleaved to the desired length (D), using a fiber cleaver (Sumitomo FC6RS). To close the FPMI, a second SMF was fusion spliced to the free end face of the capillary and then cleaved to a length d. The splicing processes were all made by using electric arcs centered far away from the capillary region. This way, we could

avoid its collapse and thus keep straight enough sides in order to minimize transverse optical losses.
2. Production of the PEI and PEI/GO coatings
For producing the optical coatings, we employed polyethylenimine (PEI) as our dielectric medium (nout = 1.615). This polymer was acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (catalog number P3143) as a waterbased solution with a 50% concentration (w/v). The PEI solution was further diluted using ultrapure water (Milli-Q water), achieving a lower concentration of 2×10-2M . For producing the multilayered hybrid coatings, we used graphene-oxide obtained from a commercial GO solution (SigmaAldrich, catalog number 777676) with a concentration of 4 mg/mL. The latter was then diluted in ultra-pure water to match the same concentration of the diluted PEI solution.
All FPMIs used in this study were coated using a layer-by-layer dip coating method. For purely dielectric (PEI) coatings, the fiber was dipped into the diluted PEI solution for 1 min, followed by a brief rinse in ultra-pure water to remove nonadsorbed residues. This process was repeated for 10 times, in order to reach a significant film thickness. In the case of the PEI/GO coatings, a similar procedure was followed, with the FPMIs being dipped alternately into the PEI and the GO solution, with a rinse and drying step in between. Here the repetition went until the desired number of bilayers (N = 10) was attained.
3. Optical Measurement Setup
The experimental setup used for the characterization of the FPMIs is schematically depicted in Fig. 7. It consisted of an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) broadband source centered at c = 1550nm with a bandwidth of (approximately) 100 nm, an optical circulator, and an optical spectrum analyzer (OSA - Yokogawa AQ6370C).

A. Experimental Results The influence of coating the output surface of an FPMI was studied by comparing the reflected spectrum before and after the dip coating process. In the presence of a PEI coating, no significant shifts or intensity changes were observed in the reflected spectrum, as obtained within an air environment. In contrast, the PEI/GO FPMI showed visible changes in the interference fringed, which appeared shifted in wavelength, with decreased intensity but a larger visibility. In Fig. 8a, we plot the reflected signal measured before and after a sensor was coated with 10 PEI/GO bilayers. The shift in the fringes is clearly marked. Besides comparing the operation of coated and uncoated FPMIs, we focus our analysis on the influence of such coatings in their sensitivity to environmental changes. Namely, we characterize the dependence of the reflected pattern on the refractive index of the output medium by immersing the sensors in calibrated liquids, with indices ranging

from nout = 1.3327 to nout = 1.3830 [56]. The spectra of reflected signals obtained with a PEI/GOcoated sensor are shown in Fig. 8b, where it is evident that changing the output medium induces measurable variations in both phase and intensity of the interferences fringes. No such response was obtained using a PEI-coated FPMI, which indicates an increased environmental sensitivity of the system in the presence of a hybrid coating.
The variations in the reflected signal of the PEI/GO sensor can be more finely evaluated by performing a spectral decomposition [57] through a fast Fourier transform (FFT). The result is shown in Fig. 9a, where the FFT amplitudes appear plotted as functions of vaccum optical cavity lengths. From our previous theoretical analysis, it is not surprising that the FFT features exactly three peaks, associated to the three Fourier components of Eq. (15). The first peak (1), at a cavity length of 91.2 µm (corresponding to a d =63 µm length for ns = 1.4444), is related to the optical cavity composed by fused silica and PEI/GO coating. The second peak (2), related to the air cavity, is located at a cavity length of D = 258.3 µm, while the third peak (3) is related to the optical cavity composed by air, silica slab, and the PEI/GO coating. Note that the estimated cavity length values are in full accordance with the ones determined by inspection of the microscope photograph in Fig. 7. Furthermore, small intensity variations are observed in Fig. 9a for the first and third peaks, while the air cavity peak remains unaffected by changes in the output refractive index. These results are consistent with the understanding that only 1 and 3 (as defined in Eq. (15)) can be affected by the reflection coefficient of the output coating and, thus being sensitive to the output medium. As an example, we also plot the FFT peak intensity of 3 as a function of nout in Fig. 9b.
The changes in the shape of interference pattern depicted in Fig. 8b, point towards an environmentally-induced variation not only of the FFT peak intensities, but also of their locations. Such changes in the periodicity of the pattern are consistent with our earlier theoretical predictions and therefore provide the sought after connection between the experiments and theory presented here. In order to analyze these shifts in the Fourier components, we begin by isolating one of the sensitive peaks using a band-pass filter in the FFT. For concreteness, we isolate the first peak (1) and obtain the filtered spectrum pre-

(color online) sented in the inset of Fig. 10. The filtered signal now exhibits an evident phase variation which actually amounts to a shift of the period 1 induced by an increase of the output refractive index. In Fig. 10, the shift in 1 are represented against our theoretical predictions for two FPMI sensors coated with N = 10 and N = 40 conducting membranes (GO) embedded into a dielectric (PEI) matrix (npol = 1.617 PEI [58]). Surprisingly, by using the simplified model of Sec. III and a real optical conductivity slightly smaller than pristine graphene ( = 0.0188 [59]), the agreement between experimental data and the theoretical curves is reasonably good, for both cases. The average distance between consecutive GO sheets was slightly adjusted for the fit ( = 95.8 nm and  = 95.6 nm, respectively) but the values are close enough to indicate a good consistence in the production of the multilayered coating. Given the imperfections expected to be present in a GO/PEI coating produced using a chemical layer-by-layer technique, we can argue our experimental results to be consistent with the downshift of a "resonant-like" be-

11

havior in the reflection phase shift at the output surface of the FPMI, as theoretically predicted for hybrid coatings in Sec. IV.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
We have proposed and experimentally demonstrated a novel interferometric sensor, based on a Fabry-Perot microcavity built at the end of a single-mode optical fiber and covered by a thin multilayered hybrid coating made of two-dimensional (graphene-like) conducting membranes embedded within a dielectric matrix. Unlike more conventional Fabry-Perot sensors, the proposed device is able to sense changes in the refractive index of the output medium by translating them to measurable shifts in the Fourier periods that compose the reflected spectrum. Our theoretical study have shown that the aforementioned changes in the interference pattern can be attributed to an enhanced environmental sensitivity of the reflection phase shift introduced by the output coating. The latter is caused by complex internal reflection, interference and energyloss processes among the different conducting surfaces contained within the coating. Moreover, as the number of layers in the coating gets increased,

the sensitivity is enhanced for lower values of the output refractive index, which allows the engineering of a sensor that works within range of indices typically found on liquid media (nout  1.3-1.4). The theoretical predictions were further tested against reflected spectral measurements done on an experimental realization of this device that employed GO/PEI multilayered structures produced using a cost effective layer-by-layer chemical dip coating process. Despite inherent imperfections on the coating's structure and the possible influence of other external physical parameters (e.g. thermal sensitivity), a sensible agreement was obtained between measurements and theoretical predictions. Besides demonstrating the concept, this agreement further encourages investment on these types of devices for future real-life sensing applications.

The existence of sharp interfaces separating different dielectric media are known to introduce discontinuities on components of electric and/or magnetic fields. In the simplest case, these interfaces are electrically neutral and cannot support charge currents. For this work, however, we must consider cases in which this last condition does not hold, because the interfaces are two-dimensional conducting membranes (e.g. graphene monolayers). In this Appendix, we will derive the general boundary conditions for such a planar interface, assuming that the two dielectrics have refractive indices n1 and n2, while the interface is a lin-

To obtain these boundary conditions, we begin by considering the interface to be planar. Despite not involving loss of generality, this geometrical arrangement allows the construction of the usual pillbox gauss surface (Fig. 11a) and Ampère square circuit (Fig. 11b) that allows us to apply Maxwell's equations in integral form:

where E, B and D are the electric magnetic and electric displacement fields, respectively. In order to keep the discussion as focused as possible, we will assume that all these fields are harmonic in space-time, e.g. E(r, t) = E0 exp (ik·r-it), and that the interface is aligned with the plane z = 0. Assuming an wavelength  = 2/ |k|, the ohmic surface currents at the interfaces are simply

where K0 = E0. Hereafter, we will use () to represent vectors which are parallel (perpendicular) to the interface. Since the current of Eq. (A2) is time-dependent, the condition of local current conservation implies that a timedependent change density wave is also usually generated. The latter can be obtained from the twodimensional continuity equation,
