## Abstract

This paper considers feedback methods for ensemble reachability of parameter-dependent linear systems $(A(\theta),B(\theta))$, where the parameter $\theta$ is varying over a compact Jordan arc in the complex plane. Recently, pointwise testable sufficient conditions for uniform ensemble reachability have been developed. Beside the necessity of pointwise reachablility these conditions put restrictions on the spectra of the matrices $A(\theta)$ and the Hermite indices of the pair $(A(\theta),B(\theta))$. In this paper we show that these conditions can be ensured by applying a suitable feedback transformation if the pair $(A(\theta),B(\theta))$ is pointwise reachable and it Kronecker indices are independent from the parameter.
