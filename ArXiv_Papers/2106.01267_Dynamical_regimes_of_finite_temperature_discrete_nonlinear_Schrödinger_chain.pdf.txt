We show that the one dimensional discrete nonlinear Schr¨odinger chain (DNLS) at finite temperature has three different dynamical regimes (ultra-low, low and high temperature regimes). This has been established via (i) one point macroscopic thermodynamic observables (temperature T , energy density  and the relationship between them), (ii) emergence and disappearance of an additional almost conserved quantity (total phase difference) and (iii) classical out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC) and related quantities (butterfly speed and Lyapunov exponents). The crossover temperatures Tl-ul (between low and ultra-low temperature regimes) and Th-l (between high and low temperature regimes) extracted from these three different approaches are consistent with each other. The analysis presented here is an important step forward towards the understanding of DNLS which is ubiquitous in many fields and has a non-separable Hamiltonian form. Our work also shows that the different methods used here can serve as important tools to identify dynamical regimes in other interacting many body systems.

I. INTRODUCTION
The discrete nonlinear Schr¨odinger chain (DNLS) exhibits a plethora of interesting mathematical and physical features, and has a wide range of applicability in real systems [1­3]. A key feature of this model is its experimental realizability. For example, the solitary waves found mathematically from the DNLS equations [4] have been observed experimentally in nonlinear optical waveguide arrays [5­7]. The importance of DNLS has also been revealed in various fields, ranging from transport in biological systems [8, 9] to condensed matter systems like localized modes in anharmonic crystals [10], soliton formation in semiconducting polymers [11], Bose-Einstein condensates [12] to name a few.
From the perspective of statistical mechanics, the nonseparable structure of the DNLS Hamiltonian (i.e. the Hamiltonian is not in the form of a sum of kinetic energy and potential energy) being non-trivial, naturally demands for extensive studies regarding the thermalization of the system. In this connection, it has been elaborately discussed in Ref. 13 that a Gibbs measure is applicable for the one-dimensional DNLS chain at positive temperatures. However, it is possible to prepare the DNLS at negative temperatures [14], where one can observe localized breather-like modes [13­15] which cannot be described by Gibbs measure.
The non-equilibrium steady states of the DNLS model has been investigated by adapting suitable Monte Carlo [16] and Langevin thermostats [17]. This non-integrable model has two conserved quantities (norm and energy) and it exhibits rich coupled transport phenomena along with interesting non-monotonous energy and density profiles [16].
Recently, there has been an interesting observation concerning the DNLS in equilibrium. It has been revealed
 amit.chatterjee@icts.res.in  manas.kulkarni@icts.res.in  anupam.kundu@icts.res.in

that the one-dimensional DNLS exhibits three different dynamical regimes [18], namely the high temperature, low

temperature and ultra-low temperature regimes. Notably, the observables used to differentiate the three dynam-

ical regimes in Ref. 18, are the two point equilibrium spatio-temporal correlations of the two conserved fields, namely, norm and energy. In particular, the high temperature regime is characterized by diffusive spreading of the correlations with zero sound velocity. On the contrary, the low temperature regime shows super-diffusive

spreading of the correlations which travel ballistically with the speed of sound. This is rooted in the existence of an additional almost conserved field (total phase difference). Consequently, in this temperature regime, the density­density correlations have symmetrically located

sound peaks travelling ballistically in opposite directions and broadening as tz with z = 2/3 [18, 19, 21]. There-

fore, the dynamical critical phenomena falls under the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. Not only the exponent but the functional form of the correlations also matches the Pr¨ahofer-Spohn scaling function [20]. This mapping of the DNLS system to the KPZ universality class has been thoroughly discussed in Ref. 18, 19, and

21. In addition to these two sound modes, one has a cen-

tral (non-moving) heat peak that broadens as t3/5 with a

L´evy

5 3

shape function

[18].

Interestingly, an almost in-

tegrable structure emerges in the ultra-low temperature

regime manifesting as ballistic broadening of all correla-

tions [16, 18].

While the two point correlations have proven to be remarkable diagnostics of the three regimes [18], it would be interesting to ask if this information about the exis-

tence of different dynamical regimes, can be extracted through the study of even simpler one point macroscopic

thermodynamic observables, like temperature, average energy density, average norm density etc. We successfully address this question in this paper by looking at the relationship between energy density and temperature. We also probe the three dynamical regimes by analyzing the emergence and disappearance of an additional conserved

quantity through phase slip events [41]. We show that the

2

different regimes can be investigated through the lens of

higher order correlations such as the classical analogue of

out-of-time-ordered correlators [26­32].

In this paper, we consider the one-dimensional DNLS

in equilibrium. To probe the different dynamical regimes

using one point thermodynamic observables, we investi-

gate the system in grand canonical ensemble. Notably,

the grand canonical ensemble is implemented by connect-

ing the DNLS to two Langevin thermostats at same tem-

perature and chemical potential at the chain ends [17].

Below, we briefly summarize our main observations.

(i) We put forward a fascinating yet simple diagnos-

tic for the three distinct dynamical regimes of DNLS in

equilibrium. We numerically find the power-law relationship T = c , where T is the temperature,  is the av-

erage energy density and c is a constant. The exponent

 serves as a demarcator of the three regimes. More

precisely, we observe that  > 1 for high temperature

regime,  < 1 for low temperature regime and  = 1

for ultra-low temperature regime (Table. II). We note

that the temperature at which the minimum of the ra-

tio r()

=

T 

occurs defines the crossover temperature

Th-l between the high temperature and low temperature

regimes. The crossover temperature (Th-l) obtained by

this method compares extremely well with the criterion

for crossover temperature proposed in Ref. 18. As we

decrease temperature further, r() starts increasing and

saturates to a constant below an ultra-low temperature

Tl-ul as expected for harmonic chains.

(ii) The DNLS has two conserved quantities, namely

the total energy and the total mass (norm). Interestingly,

we observe the emergence of an additional almost con-

served quantity (total phase difference) in the low tem-

perature regime. This distinguishes the low temperature

regime from the high temperature regime where this third

conservation law does not hold. To understand this, we

probe the system using the concept of dynamically acti-

vated processes that lead to discontinuous jumps in the

phase differences, known as phase slips. We find that the

frequency of these phase slip events increase exponen-

tially as one enters the high temperature regime, thereby

resulting in the violation of the additional conservation

law. Remarkably, the significant difference in the ac-

tivation energies required for the phase slip events, de-

marcates the low temperature regime from the high tem-

perature regime. In the ultra-low temperature regime,

we observe no phase slip events even for extremely long

times.

(iii) The DNLS is known to be generically non-

integrable [1] and chaotic in nature. However, it shows

almost integrable features at very low temperatures [17].

To investigate this in detail, we study chaos in the differ-

ent dynamical regimes of the DNLS. As tools, we have

used the classical out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC)

and related observables, namely the butterfly speed and

Lyapunov exponents [26­32]. In particular, the butter-

fly speed (measuring the speed of spatial propagation of

chaos) exhibits intriguing non-monotonic behavior with

temperature. Furthermore, the crossover temperature Tl-ul (between low and ultra-low temperature regimes) is interestingly given by the temperature at which minimum of the butterfly speed occurs. The Lyapunov exponent, on the other hand, follows a monotonically increasing power-law behavior with an exponent . Remarkably, the value of  changes considerably along the crossovers between different dynamical regimes. The space-time heat-maps of the OTOC displays visibly striking differences between the ultra-low temperature regime (oscillatory structures in space-time inside the light-cone) and the low/high temperature regimes (exponential growth inside the light-cone with oscillatory structures absent).
The paper is organized as follows. In section II, we describe the model and discuss in detail how to set up the system in grand canonical ensemble. The numerical results concerning the temperature-energy relationship distinguishing the three dynamical regimes, are presented in section III. In section IV, we analyze the different dynamical regimes through the emergence and disappearance of an additional almost conserved quantity. In section V, we probe the chaotic nature of DNLS in the three dynamical regimes using OTOC, butterfly speed and Lyapunov exponent. We conclude with a brief summary of our observations and future directions in section VI. The details of the numerical procedures used here and the relevant error analysis are presented in Appendix A and Appendix B respectively.

II. MODEL AND OBSERVABLES

The Hamiltonian of a discrete nonlinear Schr¨odinger chain (DNLS) defined on a one dimensional lattice with N sites is given by

N
H=

j |2

g 2

.

(1)

Here j (j = 1, 2 . . . N ) is a complex valued field and g > 0 is the defocusing nonlinearity parameter [1, 33]. This system has two conserved quantities, total energy E and the total `mass' A [16]. The mass conservation is equivalent to the normalization condition of the complex field j which is given by

N

A = |j|2.

(2)

j=1

Here |j|2 can be interpreted as the local mass density associated with the site j. In case of periodic bound-
ary conditions (N+i = i), it is easy to see that the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) can be re-written as

N
H = 2A +

One should note that the minus sign in front of the
hopping term is irrelevant due to the symmetry associ-
ated with a suitable gauge transformation of the form j  eijj. Using this gauge transformation, the Hamiltonian in Eq. (3) becomes

N
H = 2A +

j+1j + j+1j

In order to bring out the interesting non-separable structure of the DNLS Hamiltonian, a pair of canonically conjugate variables (qj, pj) can be introduced as

j

=

(qj

+ ipj),

j

1 2

(qj

ipj ),

(5)

where both qj and pj are real valued variables j. Accordingly, the two conserved quantities, the energy given by the Hamiltonian in Eq. (4) and mass given in Eq. (2) take the following forms

H = 2A + HDNLS,

j=1

It is evident from Eq. (6) that the quartic on-site nonlinear term represents the interaction between q and p degrees of freedom, whereas the hopping terms imitate the coupling between the degrees of freedom at nearestneighbor sites. Importantly, we should note how the introduction of the canonical co-ordinates (qi, pi) clearly exhibits the non-separable structure of the DNLS Hamiltonian. More precisely, from the expression of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (6), we observe that qi-s and pi-s are not the usual positions and momenta. Consequently, H is not in the usual separable sum form of kinetic energy and potential energy. Rather, the Hamiltonian has a non-trivial non-separable form (symmetric under the exchange qi  pi) giving rise to intriguing dynamical features.
In this paper, we consider the 1D DNLS in a grand canonical ensemble. For this purpose, we connect the chain with two Langevin thermostats of same temperature T and same chemical potential µ at it's two ends (j = 1 and j = N ) [17]. To model DNLS in equilibrium, both the thermostats are kept at same temperature T and same chemical potential µ. The Langevin dynamics should be chosen in such a way that the system finally relaxes to the grand canonical equilibrium distribution

where  > 0 is the coupling strength between the system and reservoirs. 1 , 1, N , N are Gaussian white noises each of which is delta correlated i.e. (t)(s) = (t - s) and has zero mean. The explicit expressions for the equations of motion in Eq. (8) and the numerical methods used for the corresponding numerical integration are discussed in detail in Appendix A.
The main goal of this work is to show that even relationships between simple one point thermodynamic observables, average energy density () and temperature (T ), clearly exhibits the existence of three different dynamical regimes of DNLS in equilibrium, investigated earlier in Ref. 18 using higher order two point equilibrium spatio-temporal correlations. Also, we analyze the distinction between the different regimes through the emergence and disappearance of an additional almost conserved quantity (total phase difference) using the concept of phase slip events [41]. In addition, we would like to see the signatures of the different dynamical regimes in higher point correlations of the microscopic degrees of freedom, through OTOC, butterfly speed and Lyapunov exponent [26­32]. In this connection, we numerically compute the following quantities - temperature T using a generalized virial theorem, average energy density () and average mass density () [see section III], OTOC [Dx(i, t)] (see section V). This is done using Eq. (8) [see Appendix A for details]. The various observables analyzed in this work are explicitly given in Table. I.
In the subsequent sections, using the grand canonical set up described here, we compute these quantities numerically and discuss how their behaviour distinguishes the three temperature regimes mentioned above.

III. DYNAMICAL REGIMES
In this section, we would like to present and analyze the numerical results on temperature (T ), average energy density () and the relation between them. We show how this relation between one point thermodynamic functions

demarcates the different dynamical regimes - the ultralow temperature, low temperature and high temperature regimes. As mentioned earlier, the existence of these three regimes has been reported recently in Ref. 18, but by means of higher order two point equilibrium spatiotemporal correlations of the conserved quantities  and . It is pertinent to mention that the grand canonical (Eq. 8) set up with Langevin thermostats thermalize the DNLS system [17]. While it is relatively easy and conventional to thermalize a Hamiltonian with separable structure [34] in numerical simulations, thermalizing a non-

separable Hamiltonian such as DNLS is far from obvious [17] (see Appendix A for details). Therefore, naturally, this demands for a rigorous and careful check for thermalization in the wide range of temperatures starting from ultra-low temperature regime up to the high temperature regime. To study thermalization, we take aid of the generalized virial theorem stated below.

FIG. 2. In this figure, we present the numerical data for T versus  in log-log scale. Interestingly, we observe the existence of three different temperature regimes of the DNLS, clearly demarcated by the value of the exponent  (Eq. 11). The sub-figures (a), (b) and (c) represent ultra-low temperature, low temperature and high temperature regime characterized by  = 1,  < 1 and  > 1 respectively. Parameters used are g = 2.0, µ = 2.0 and the chain length is N = 128.

A. Generalized virial theorem

The generalized virial theorem [35] states how the macroscopic temperature T of the system is related to the microscopic degrees of freedom qj -s (or equivalently pj-s). It is given by

qj

Hµ({qj qj

,

pj

})

= kBT,

(9)

where Hµ({qj, pj}) is the Hamiltonian of the system. For DNLS, the Hamiltonian Hµ is given in Eq. (7) and . denotes time average over equilibrium state. We set

Boltzmann constant kB = 1 throughout the manuscript. Through involved numerical integration of the equations

of motion (Eq. 8), we compute the virial observable

qj

Hµ qj

and observe that, indeed, the time average of

this quantity converges very well to the temperature T of

the Langevin thermostats. In the upper panel of Fig. 1,

we verify Eq. (9) for three different temperature regimes

of the thermostats - (a) ultra-low temperature, (b) low

temperature and (c) high temperature. The equilibration

in the DNLS is further ensured by investigating spatial

profiles of the energy density j (Table I), which is plotted in the lower panel of Fig. 1 for the respective tem-

perature regimes. At sufficiently high temperatures, we

notice some spatial fluctuations of the virial observables

around the mean [Fig. 1(c) and Fig. 1(f)]. It is pertinent

to mention that the extents of these spatial fluctuations

are small as supported by the error analysis in Appendix

B (see Fig. 18).

B. T -  relation
Having computed T and  in the previous section, one naturally wonders about the intricate relationship between them. In simple linear systems (for e.g., Harmonic

chain), these two are proportional to each other. However in nonlinear systems, this relationship is far from obvious which is what we investigate here. We demonstrate below that this relation becomes instrumental to identify the three temperature regimes mentioned earlier.
For usual separable Hamiltonian with potential energy being a homogeneous function of degree , the generalized virial theorem in Eq. (9) results in the following T - relationship [36]

For example, for a coupled Harmonic chain with

Hamiltonian H =

qj2 2m

(qj+1

(qj, pj being usual position and momentum respectively),

the potential energy is a homogeneous function of de-

gree  = 2. Consequently, Eq. (10) implies that r = 1

and T =  for the coupled Harmonic chain. Whereas

if one considers a different interaction with  = 4

with r = 4/3. It is far from obvious how Eq. (10) gets

generalized for the non-separable Hamiltonian such as

DNLS [Eq. (6)] which is also inhomogeneous. To inves-

tigate this, we plot T versus  in Fig. 2 (in the three

different temperature regimes) and try to fit the corre-

sponding data points using a power law of the form

T = c .

(11)

We find that the DNLS indeed has three different temperature regimes clearly demarcated from each other by the value of the exponent . Interestingly, from the subfigures (a), (b) and (c) in Fig. 2, we observe that  = 1,  < 1 and  > 1 in these three different regimes, which we call as ultra-low temperature regime, low temperature

6

regime and high temperature regime respectively, following the nomenclature used in Ref. 18. The crossover temperatures between high and low temperature regimes and that of the low and ultra-low temperature regimes, would be referred to as Th-l and Tl-ul respectively. More elaborately, for 0 < T < Tl-ul, the DNLS is in ultra-low temperature regime characterized by  = 1 [Fig. 2(a)]. Clearly, at ultra-low temperatures,  = 1 infers an almost linear T -  relation similar to separable Hamiltonian systems with homogeneous potentials as discussed in Eq. (10). In contrast, the non-trivial nature of the DNLS Hamiltonian becomes apparent from the strongly nonlinear relation between T and  in the high temperature regime T > Th-l where  > 1. More intriguingly, in the intermediate low temperature regime where Tl-ul < T < Th-l, the T -  relation is still nonlinear but with  < 1. For the particular example shown in Fig. 2 with specific parameter values, the differences between the values of  in different temperature regimes are small. Therefore, we calculate the corresponding error bars systematically in Appendix B and show that the error bars are indeed negligibly small compared to the differences in the  values (Fig. 19). So, we conclude that the exponent  (appearing in the relation Eq. (11) between one point macroscopic observables T and ), acts as a remarkable identifier of the different dynamical regimes of the DNLS.
Based on Eq. (11) and the corresponding observations from Fig. 2, it seems reasonable to define an empirical specific heat, C(T ) as

C(T )

=

 T

=

1



c

1 

T . 1- 

(12)

Consequently, C(T ) exhibits intricate behavior as a function of temperature and distinguishes the three dynamical regimes. More precisely, in the ultra-low temperature regime where  = 1, Eq. (12) implies that the specific heat is constant. However, as we enter the low temperature regime characterized by  < 1, C(T ) starts increasing as we increase temperature. Contrary to this, in the high temperature regime with  > 1, the specific heat intriguingly decreases with increasing temperature. Thus, this anomalous behavior of C(T ) clearly separates the different temperature regimes. Notably, this kind of anomalous behavior of specific heat has been observed in different context, from experimental measurements in certain liquid crystal films [37­39] and corresponding theoretical modeling using coupled hexatic-nematic XY model [40].
Another equivalent and more transparent demarcator between different dynamical regimes is the ratio between T and ,

r(T )



T 

.

(13)

This is a simpler demarcator as the three regimes can be identified by looking at the plot r(T ) versus T as shown in Fig. 3. From Fig. 3, we observe that r(T ) increases monotonically with increasing temperature in the high temperature regime (T > Th-l). In sharp contrast, in the low

FIG. 3. The behavior of r(T ) (Eq. 13) evidently distinguishes the three dynamical regimes of DNLS. r(T ) increases monotonically with temperature in the high temperature regime, in contrary to its monotonically decreasing trend in the low temperature regime. The temperature at which minimum of r(T ) occurs, defines the crossover temperature Th-l between high temperature and low temperature regime. As shown in the inset, r(T ) remains almost constant in the ultra-low temperature regime followed by a monotonic decrease in the low temperature regime, the crossover temperature being marked as Tl-ul. Parameters used are g = 2.0, µ = 2.0 and the chain length is N = 128.

temperature regime (Tl-ul < T < Th-l), r(T ) decreases monotonically with increasing temperature. Clearly, as a function of T , r(T ) shows a minimum at the crossover between low temperature and high temperature regime marked by Th-l (which is 1.50 for the parameter values used in Fig. 3). The distinction between low temperature and ultra-low temperature regime is shown in the inset of Fig. 3. There, we observe that r(T ) is almost a constant with fluctuations of very small amplitudes in the ultralow temperature regime (0 < T < Tl-ul). However, once the temperature Tl-ul (which is 0.10 for the parameter values used in Fig. 3) is reached, we start observing a monotonic decrease in r(T ) that marks the onset of lowtemperature regime. It is thereby obvious that r(T ) is a much more transparent demarcator than  (Fig. 2). In other words, r(T ) is a more effective and transparent way to find out the location of crossover temperatures as discussed below.
It is remarkable that the crossover temperature Th-l can be obtained exactly from the minimum of r(T ) vs. T plot i.e.

Th-l = arg min r(T ).

This finding based on our numerical results is consistent with the criterion for determining the crossover temperature in Ref. 18 obtained from a very different approach. This criterion [18] is based on the frequency of specific dynamical processes leading to an additional conserva-

We conclude this section with a brief summary of the main findings which is presented in Table II. In Table II, we observe that the exponent  in the T -  relation (Eq. (11), Fig. 2) acts as a clear demarcator of the three different dynamical regimes of the DNLS in equilibrium. More precisely, we find that  = 1,  < 1 and  > 1 for ultra-low, low and high temperature regimes respectively. Another remarkable demarcator of the three regimes is the ratio r(T ) (Eq. (13), Fig. 3). As exhibited in Table II, r(T ) remains constant in the ultra-low temperature regime, whereas it decreases monotonically in the low temperature regime and increases monotonically in the high temperature regime. Also, the crossover temperature Th-l is interestingly given by the temperature at which minimum of r(T ) occurs [Eq. (14)]. The prediction from this criterion has excellent agreement with the criterion proposed in Ref. 18, as will be discussed in detail in the next section.

IV. EMERGENCE AND DISAPPEARANCE OF AN ALMOST CONSERVED QUANTITY: PHASE
SLIPS

In this section, we would like to probe the different dynamical regimes of DNLS through the emergence and disappearance of an additional almost conserved quantity, namely the total phase difference, as temperature is varied. To define this observable in a systematic way, let us consider the ground state (T = 0) of the DNLS Hamiltonian in Eq. (7), in terms of the original complex valued field j0-s (where 0 denotes the ground state), given by [17]

j0(t) = 0ei(j+µt), j = 1, 2 . . . N.

(15)

Here, 0 is the average mass density calculated in ground state and µ is the chemical potential. At small non-zero
temperature, the density field as well as the phase field will fluctuate over space and time. We denote them by
j(t) (background plus fluctuation) and j(t) = j + µt + j(t), respectively. Consequently, the  fields also become non-trivially dependent on space and time as

j (t) = j ei(j+µt+j), j = 1, 2 . . . N.

(16)

The variables (j, j) are connected to the canonically conjugate variables (qj, pj) introduced in Eq. (5) as

qj(t) = 2j cos(j + µt + j)

pj(t) = 2j sin(j + µt + j).

(17)

Consequently, in terms of the radial (j ) and angle variables (j), the Hamiltonian in Eq. (7) can be expressed as

Hµ =

N

[-2j j+1

cos(j+1

- j) +

].

(18)

j=1

The DNLS Hamiltonian in Eq. (18), as already mentioned, has two conserved quantities: total energy E and total mass A. This leads to local conservation laws in terms of conserved fields j and j (Table I). Interestingly, it turns out that there is an additional emergent almost conserved quantity associated to the phase difference [18]

j(t) = mod[j+1(t) - j(t), 2].

(19)

From Eq. (19), we note that the domain of j(t) is [-, ]. As long as j(t) remains within (-, ), the total phase difference j j is conserved by the dynamics. This happens at low temperatures where one observes super-diffusive scaling of the correlation function thereby
putting it in the KPZ universality class [18, 19]. As temperature is increased, phase difference j starts reaching the boundaries of the box [-, ] (i.e. j(t) = ±). This is exhibited in Fig. 4 where we observe that at very low temperatures, the phase difference j(t) always remain very close to zero [Figs. 4(a), 4(b)], thereby near the ground state value. However, as temperature is in-
creased, j often takes bigger values [Fig. 4(c)] and at even higher temperatures [Fig. 4(d)], we notice that the
phase difference starts touching the boundaries ± at several times. At such an event, the winding number is
increased (j(t) = -) or decreased (j (t) = +) by one unit. This results in discontinuous jumps of j(t) as a function of time. These jumps are called phase slips [18, 41]. To illustrate the mechanism of the phase slip
events, we present j(t) versus t in Fig. 5 at T = 5.0 which is sufficiently high to observe a good number of
phase slips even within a small time interval. In Fig. 5, we observe total five discontinuous jumps or slip events (by
an amount 2). Among them, three events (red arrow) correspond to increase of winding number by +1 (i.e.

FIG. 4. The behavior of phase difference j(t) with time t at few representative temperatures. Here N = 8 and j = 4 (i.e. the 4-th bond). At very low temperatures (a) T =0.01 and (b) T =0.10, the phase difference fluctuates very near to its ground state value j(t) = 0. At higher temperature (c) T =1.0, the phase difference increases considerably and at even higher temperature (d) T =5.0, j (t) touches the boundary values ± at several times causing phase slips.

j(t) = - and j(t + t) = , t being the appropriate time gap between two successive measurements). The remaining two (blue arrow) indicate decrease of winding number by -1 (i.e. j(t) =  and j(t + t) = -). Hence, during the short time interval in Fig. 5, the net nonzero winding number (3 - 2 = 1) contributes to the breakdown of this emergent conservation law of the total phase difference through the bond j. Thus, phase slip events break the conservation of total phase difference. To observe how frequently these phase slip events happen in space(j)-time(t) as we vary temperature, the spatio-temporal heat-maps for the winding numbers are presented in Fig. 6. The red dots and blue dots in Fig. 6 correspond to unit increase (i.e. j (t) = -) and unit decrease (i.e. j(t) = ) of winding numbers respectively. Fig. 6 clearly demonstrates that the total number of phase slip events are considerably small at low temperatures. As the temperature is increased, we observe noticeable increase in the number of phase slip events. Also, in the ultra-low temperature regime, we do not observe any phase slip events even for extremely long times considered here.
Since these discontinuous jumps or phase slips occur randomly through dynamically activated processes, one can try to analyze them from the viewpoint of activation energy. If V denotes the activation energy required on average to generate phase slips, the probability for

FIG. 5. The figure shows the occurrence of phase slip events for j = 4 in a DNLS with N = 8. Discontinuous jumps of amount 2 indicates phase slip events. In total there are five such events in this figure. In particular, the red arrows or j (t) = - correspond to increase in winding number by +1 (three such events in the figure). The blue arrows or j(t) =  correspond to decrease in winding number by -1 (two such events in the figure). Therefore, up to the times considered here, the net nonzero winding number is (3 - 2) = 1, thereby providing a route for the breakdown of the emergent conservation law.

such an event to occur is  e-V . This implies that the phase difference is conserved in the low temperature regime up to a time scale  eV . Then the frequency of phase slip events is expected to vary with inverse temperature as ()  e-V . We numerically verify the exponentially decreasing nature of () in Fig. 7 where the total number of phase slip events on average is plotted against inverse temperature . Further analysis of this exponential behavior is presented in Fig. 8. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 8, the activation energy obtained from the slope of the () versus  plot in log scale, differs considerably in high temperature and low temperature regimes. We observe that the average activation energy for phase slips in low temperature regime Vl = 6.34 is much higher than that of the high temperature regime Vh = 4.22. The crossover temperature here Th-l  1.50 between two different regimes with different activation energies, is in good agreement with the crossover temperature Th-l = 1.50 observed from Fig. 3 and defined through Eq. (14).
The numerically obtained Vh and Vl are results of complex dynamical processes along with averages. We would now like to get some theoretical insight into the activation energy. To do so, let us consider a phase slip event caused by the dynamics at a single site (j). Considering j =  and j = , the local energy at a single site is

FIG. 6. The figure represents space-time heat-maps for phase slip events at different temperatures, measured in terms of change in winding numbers. The red and blue dots correspond to winding number +1 (i.e. j(t) = -) and -1 (i.e. j(t) = ) respectively. While the phase slip events are very small in number at lower temperatures [(a) T = 1.0, (b) T = 1.5], they increase rapidly for comparatively higher temperatures [(a) T = 2.0, (b) T = 4.0]. The behavior of phase slips as a function of temperature is further analyzed in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. Here N = 128, µ = 2 and g = 2.

It is straightforward to find that the minimum of h(, )

in Eq. (20) happens to be at  = 0 and  =

µ+2 g

.

Considering  to be constant, the activation energy V1 required for a phase slip event, i.e.  changing from 0

to ± , is

V1 = h(, ±) - h(, 0) = 4.

(21)

On the other hand, let us consider the case where  =  = 0 (i.e. its ground state value). The notion of a
phase slip at a given site becomes ill-defined when the density at that site goes to zero. The energy required to
do so is given by

V2

=

h(0, 0) -

h(, 0)

=

g 2

2.

(22)

Hence, we have estimates for V1 [Eq. (21)] and V2 [Eq. (22)]. These processes occur with frequencies e-V1 and e-V2 respectively. This in turn implies
that the conservation of the phase difference in low temperature regime has lifetimes proportional to eV1 and eV2 .
To ensure that the total phase difference remains con-
served for sufficiently long times, a safe estimate of
V 2 has been put forward in Ref. 42 and Ref. 18.

Here V represents various mechanisms involved in phase slips. For example, in our case (DNLS), V symbolizes V1 [Eq. (21)] and V2 [Eq. (22)]. In other words, the low temperature regime with three conservation laws are expected to prevail if both the following conditions are satisfied,

(24) with the criterion we propose in Eq. (14), we plot r(T ) with temperature in the inset, for different system sizes.

Eq. (24) begins to violate indicating the onset of high

temperature regime (T > Th-l). We note that the value of the crossover temperature Th-l estimated here is in excellent agreement to the corresponding Th-l value obtained from Eq. (14) which is presented in the inset of

V. OTOC, LYAPUNOV EXPONENT AND BUTTERFLY SPEED IN DIFFERENT REGIMES

 and their relation in Eq. (11) (see Table II). Whereas in section IV, these dynamical regimes are differentiated through the emergence and disappearance of an additional almost conserved quantity (total phase difference) caused by dynamically activated phase slip events. In this section, we would like to probe these regimes with a separate approach, based on observables related to many body chaos. It is worth recollecting that DNLS exhibits chaotic nature at high temperatures. At ultra low temperatures, DNLS is known to display almost integrable features [16]. Keeping in mind, the well-known connection between non-integrability and chaos [24, 25], it would be interesting to investigate chaos in DNLS in different temperature regimes. To proceed along this direction, we investigate the classical out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), the butterfly speed and the Lyapunov exponent [26­32].
The OTOC is a spatio-temporal measure of chaos and in fact, both the butterfly speed (spatial indicator of chaos) and the Lyapunov exponent (temporal indicator of chaos) can be derived directly from the OTOC [29]. We define the OTOC for the microscopic degrees of freedom qj-s (equivalently one can use pj-s) as

Dq(j, t; T ) =

qjI (t) - qjII (t) q0I (0) - q0II (0)

in this section. In Eq. (25), we consider two copies (I

and II) of the DNLS, which initially (t = 0) differ from

each other only by an infinitesimal deviation q0(0). We measure how this initially localized (at 0-th site) devia-

The main plot shows sharply increasing vb(T ) with increasing temperature in the low temperature regime. This is separated from the very slowly varying speed in the high temperature regime, where the crossover temperature is around Th-l = 1.50. In the inset, we show the non-monotonic behavior of vb(T ) between ultralow temperature regime (the butterfly speed has an overall decreasing trend) and low temperature regime (sharply increasing speed). The occurrence of the minimum of the butterfly speed defines the crossover temperature Tl-ul = 0.10 between these two regimes. This is consistent with the Tl-ul value obtained previously in the inset of Fig. 3 (r(T ) versus T ).

tion affects the system at other points in space at later time t. The explicit expressions for the equations of motion for qj-s and the details of numerical integration can be found in Appendix A. Clearly, the OTOC Dq(j, t; T ) in Eq. (25) is a function of space and time and we present the corresponding heat-map in Fig. 10 at T = 5.0 (high temperature regime). In Fig. 10, we observe a light-cone structure with sharp boundaries where the sites inside the light-cone have exponential growth of the deviation. This light-cone like OTOC-s are typically observed in other chaotic Hamiltonian systems [26, 27, 32].
The ballistic spread of the light-cone in Fig. 10 implies the existence of a constant speed of spatial propagation of the OTOC, known as the butterfly speed. As mentioned earlier, the butterfly speed can be defined directly using the OTOC, given below

The step function (.) in Eq. (26) measures how many sites have gained deviation greater than or equal to the initial deviation (at site 0) after some time t. From Fig. 10 we observe that this number grows proportional to t. Therefore, Eq. (26) gives us the constant speed vb(T ) which depends on the temperature T . The behav-

ior of the butterfly speed as we vary the temperature, is shown in Fig. 11. Interestingly, we observe that the butterfly speed behaves very differently in the three distinct dynamical regimes. As shown in the inset of Fig. 11, vb(T ) has an overall decreasing trend with increasing T in the ultra-low temperature regime. In sharp contrast, the butterfly speed increases rapidly as T increases in the low temperature regime as observed in Fig. 11 and its inset. This non-monotonic behavior of vb(T ) with T , defines the crossover temperature Tl-ul between ultralow and low temperature regimes. More precisely, Tl-ul can be measured as the temperature at which minimum of the butterfly speed occurs, given by

Tl-ul = arg min vb(T ).

(27)

T

Notably, the value of Tl-ul obtained in the inset of Fig. 11 is in very good agreement with the same observed in the inset of Fig. 3 where a different observable r(T ) [Eq. (13)] has been investigated. A non-monotonic characteristic of vb(T ), similar to the one observed here, has been reported recently [30] in the context of classical 2D XXZ model. There, the minimum of the butterfly speed occurs at the transition temperatures for both the Ising and the Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. The steepness of the growth of the butterfly speed as a function of temperature, falls off considerably as soon as the system enters to the high temperature regime. This is observed from the very slowly varying trend of vb(T ) in the high temperature regime in Fig. 11. The crossover temperature between the slowly varying butterfly speed in high temperature regime and the rapidly increasing speed in low temperature regime, happens to be around Th-l = 1.50. This agrees very well with the crossover temperature Th-l

In the ultra-low temperature regime (a), we observe intriguing oscillatory structures both in time and space. This feature vanishes in the low temperature regime regime (b). Also, (b) shows exponential growth of OTOC inside the light-cone. The typical OTOC behavior in the high temperature regime, exhibiting exponential growth inside the light-cone has already been presented in Fig. 10 (T = 5.0).

To analyze the temporal growth of the OTOC (Fig. 10) at temperature T , we consider the Lyapunov exponent [j(T )] at the site j defined as

j(T ) =

(28)

At sufficiently large time, each j(T ) (where j = -N/2+ 1, . . . , 0 . . . , N/2) converges to the same constant value [29]. Therefore, without any loss of generality, one can
focus on the behavior of 0(T ) as temperature is varied. This is presented in Fig. 12. The figure shows that 0(T )

is a monotonically increasing function of T . However, a more careful observation reveals that the Lyapunov exponent grows much faster with T at lower temperatures in comparison to a slower growth at sufficiently high temperatures. To investigate this behavior in a more systematic way, we fit the numerically obtained 0(T ) to the power law  T  separately in the three dynamical regimes. The corresponding results are plotted on log scales in Fig. 13. We observe that the value of the exponent  deviate significantly in the different dynamical regimes. As expected from the observations in Fig. 12, we find that  is maximum in the low temperature regime [Fig. 13(b)] indicating the maximum growth rate of the Lyapunov exponent in this regime. Interestingly, as demonstrated in Fig. 13(c),   0.5 in the high temperature regime. We should mention that this behavior 0(T )  T has also been observed recently in some other chaotic Hamiltonian systems with very different microscopic dynamics [27, 28, 30, 44].
Having discussed how the butterfly speed and the Lyapunov exponents display significantly different behaviors in different dynamical regimes, a natural question that arises is, how the heat-maps of OTOC in these regimes differ from each other. To answer this, we present in Fig. 14 the corresponding OTOC heat-maps in ultra-low and low temperature regimes (recall that Fig. 10 represents the typical OTOC behavior in high temperature regime). Indeed, from Fig. 14(a) we observe interesting oscillatory structures in both space and time, thereby manifesting the almost integrable nature of DNLS in the ultra-low temperature regime. This is in sharp contrast to the behaviors in low temperature [Fig. 14(b)] and high temperature regimes [Fig. 10].

VI. SUMMARY
In this paper, we have shown that the one dimensional discrete nonlinear Schr¨odinger chain, which has an interesting non-separable Hamiltonian structure, exhibits three different dynamical regimes at finite temperatures. These three regimes, namely the ultra-low, low and high temperature regimes, have been characterized here and differentiated from one another using several distinct approaches. These include (i) analyzing one point macroscopic thermodynamic observables (temperature T , energy density ) and their relationship (T  ), (ii) investigating the emergence and disappearance of an additional (apart from total energy and total mass) almost conserved quantity (total phase difference) by studying phase slip events, and (iii) probing the chaotic dynamics of the DNLS with the classical out-of-time-ordered correlators and derived quantities (butterfly speed, Lyapunov exponent).
The nontrivial task of thermalizing the non-separable DNLS Hamiltonian [Eq. (6)] has been achieved here by connecting the system to Langevin thermostats at both ends following the procedure [Eq. (8)] in Ref. 17. Through rigorous numerical simulations we verify that this nontrivial process indeed leads to proper thermalization in the DNLS (Fig. 1). We find numerically that the one point thermodynamic observables, namely temperature (T ) and energy density (), defined in Table I, follow the relation T = c . Remarkably,  acts as a prominent identifier of the three different dynamical regimes. More precisely, we notice that  = 1 in the ultra-low temperature regime,  < 1 in the low temperature regime and  > 1 in the high temperature regime (Fig. 2). The demarcation of these different regimes becomes even more visibly clear from the behavior of r(T ) = T / as a function of temperature (Fig. 3). To elaborate, r(T ) remains almost constant in the ultra-low temperature regime, decreases monotonically in the low temperature regime and increases monotonically in the high temperature regime. This overall non-monotonic behavior of r(T ) helps us to identify the crossover temperature Th-l (between high and low temperature regimes) which remarkably turns out to be the temperature at which minimum of r(T ) occurs [Eq. (14)]. The characterization of the three different regimes using  and r(T ) has been summarized in Table II.
The DNLS has two conserved quantities, the total energy and the total mass [Eq. (6)]. Interestingly, an additional almost conserved quantity, namely the total phase difference emerges in the low temperature regime making it distinct from the high temperature regime (where this conservation does not hold). This emergence and disappearance of the third conservation law has been analyzed here through the concept of dynamical processes leading to discontinuous jumps or phase slip events (Fig. 5). In fact, the total number of phase slip events falls off exponentially as a function of the inverse temperature (Fig. 7). Importantly, we find that the activation energy

required for the phase slip events are significantly different in the low and high temperature regimes, thereby demarcating these two regimes (Fig. 8). This in turn means that the frequency of phase slip events are very low in the low temperature regime, resulting in the conservation of the total phase difference for extremely long times. On the other hand, the phase slips occur very frequently in the high temperature regime (Fig. 6). We also find the in the ultra-low temperature regime, phase slips do not occur even at very long times that we have considered here. The theoretical estimates of the activation energies involved in the phase slip events predicts the crossover temperature Th-l which is found to be in excellent agreement (Fig. 9) to that obtained from the previous approach (Eq. (14), Fig. 3).
To probe the chaotic nature of the DNLS at high temperature and its almost integrable behavior in the ultra-low temperature regime, we investigate the classical OTOC [Eq. (25)], butterfly speed [Eq. (26)] and Lyapunov exponent [Eq. (28)]. In particular, the butterfly speed exhibits an interesting non-monotonic behavior with varying temperature (Fig. 11). It has an overall decreasing behavior in the ultra-low temperature regime contrary to the rapidly increasing characteristic in the low temperature regime, followed by a much slower growth rate in the high temperature regime. Remarkably, the crossover temperature Tl-ul can be measured as the temperature at which the minimum of the butterfly speed occurs (Eq. (27), Fig. 11). On the other hand, the Lyapunov exponent increases monotonically as a function of temperature (Fig. 12). However, it shows interesting crossovers in the values of the exponent  when fitted to a power law 0(T ) = T  (Fig. 13). Particularly, the maximum growth rate of the Lyapunov exponent with temperature happens to be in the low temperature regime. This is followed by a behavior 0(T )  T in the high temperature regime that has been observed previously in other contexts [27, 28, 30, 44]. The space-time heat-maps of the OTOC presents visibly prominent differences between the ultra-low temperature regime (Fig. 14(a), oscillatory structures in space-time inside the light-cone), low [Fig. 14(b)] and high temperature regimes (Fig. 10).
Having established these various methods, it would be interesting to adapt them to explore other interacting many body systems including non-separable Hamiltonian systems (e.g. various generalizations of DNLS [45­48], spin chains [26, 41, 49­51] etc.). In future, we plan to understand the different dynamical regimes and the onset of chaos in such systems through the lens of a mode coupling theory [32].

Appendix A: Details of numerical procedure

Here we provide the numerical details for (i) initial conditions, (ii) equations of motion, (iii) methods of numerical integration, and (iv) averaging procedures used in this paper to compute the observables of interest. To start with, we recall that the effect of the Langevin thermostats (used for thermalization) has to be invoked carefully because of the non-separable nature of the DNLS Hamiltonian [Eq. 6]. Unlike the separable Hamiltonians where the interaction with Langevin thermostats modifies only the momentum equations, equations for both q and p get modified for DNLS [16]. In other words, q and p for DNLS are on equal footing. This makes the procedure for achieving equilibration using Langevin thermostats, significantly different from the traditional approach. The equations of motions take the following form,

where  is the coupling strength between the system
and the bath. Since the Langevin thermostats are connected to both ends (i.e. 1st and N th sites), the equa-
tions of motions for q1, p1; qN , pN are modified accordingly in Eq. (A1). 1 , 1, N , N are Gaussian white noises each of which is delta correlated with unit variance i.e. (t)(s) = (t - s). The explicit expressions

We have used random initial conditions such that

(qj, pj)  [-1, 1] j at t = 0. For numerical integration of the stochastic differential equations in Eq. (A1),

we have utilized an improved version of the stochastic in-

tegration method (described in Ref. 52) based on Taylor

series expansion that keeps terms of order h2 for the de-

terministic

terms

and order

h5 2

for

the

stochastic terms.

The time step size h, used for numerical integration, has

been fixed to 0.001.

For computing the OTOC [Eq. 25], butterfly speed

[Eq. 26] and Lyapunov exponent [Eq. 28] with average

over initial conditions, we first let the system to ther-

malize at desired temperature T using the procedure

in Eq. (A1). Once the system reaches equilibrium, we

detach the Langevin thermostats. Thereafter, we use

fourth order Runge-Kutta method for numerically inte-

grating the following equations of motion of the equili-

brated DNLS system,

qj = f (pj+1, pj-1, pj , qj ) pj = -f (qj+1, qj-1, qj , pj )

q j = g(pj+1, pj-1, pj , qj , pj, qj ) p j = -g(qj+1, qj-1, qj, pj, qj, pj),

(A3)

where j = 1, 2, . . . , N and the explicit expressions for f (.) and g(.) are respectively,

We choose qj(0) = j,k and pj(0) = 0, with  = 10-6 used in all the simulations. The average over the initial conditions has been done over 103 equilibrated initial
conditions.

Appendix B: Computation of error bars for 
In this section, we would like to discuss in detail the error bars corresponding to the values of  [Eq. (11)] in different dynamical regimes (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2,  = 0.999(7) in ultra-low temperature regime,  = 0.957(7) in low temperature regime and  = 1.139(6) in high temperature regime (µ = 2.0, g = 2.0). Since the differences between the values of  in different regimes are small, we would like to present here a careful and

detailed analysis of the error bars associated with the corresponding  values. Below, we discuss this step by step.

1. The error bar d for the exponent  can be obtained by differentiating the relation T = c 
[Eq. (11)] as

d =

 d  ln()

,

(B1)

where the temperature T is kept fixed and c is a constant. Note, in Eq. (B1), we focus only on the absolute value of d since ultimately we would consider  ± d. Clearly, to compute d, we have to compute the standard deviation of the energy density d from our simulations.
2. We start with a random initial condition for the microscopic variables qj-s and pj-s of the DNLS and let the system evolve. After the transient period is over, we start computing the observables of interest. In particular, here we consider the local energy

density j (Table I) where j = 1, 2 . . . N . Adapting the ideas from Ref. 53, we do not compute the observable at each time step. Rather, we do that after every 100 time steps to minimize the correlation between the data points of the sample.
3. We collect a sample of total n (here n = 1.5 × 107) data points. The m-th data point in the sample would be denoted as j,m where m = 1, 2, . . . n. Then we calculate the sample average ¯j of energy density and the corresponding sample standard deviation s¯j as

FIG. 19. The values of  in different dynamical regimes are plotted along with the corresponding error bars d [Eq. (B1)]. In all three regimes, namely (a) ultra-low temperature regime, (b) low temperature regime and (c) high temperature regime, we observe that the corresponding error bars are significantly smaller than the  values themselves. Therefore,  can prominently demarcate the three dynamical regimes.

4. If we could repeat this numerical experiment for a large number of samples, we would get a sample average ¯j for each of them. This way of doing enough repeats essentially implies averaging over the exact distribution of the observable. As explained in Ref. 53, it turns out that the sample mean ¯j is the best estimate for the actual mean which is obtained in principle by using the exact probability distribution. However, this is expected to be accompanied with an error bar (standard deviation) ¯j. The actual standard deviation ¯j is connected to the sample standard deviation s¯j as [53]

¯j

=

 s¯j n-

1.

(B3)

So, we numerically compute ¯j for several temperatures in the range of interest i.e. 0.005  T  10. To get some estimates of the corresponding values,
we present ¯j in Fig. 15 at the two extreme temperatures T = 0.005 (ultra-low temperature regime)
and T = 10.0 (high temperature regime).

5. We have previously observed [Fig. 1(f), Fig. 15(b)] spatial fluctuations in the spatial profiles of the average and standard deviation of energy at several temperatures. Then, it would be natural to perform further spatial averages over N sites as follows

(B4)

Both  and  are now independent of space (global) and they are functions of temperature. To get an estimate of  as a function of temperature, we present the corresponding plot in Fig. 16.

6. In this connection, we define  = / to measure
the relative error with respect to the average.
In Fig. 17, we observe that for any temperature  < 10-2.

7. It is important to note that, after the time average with respect to the sample of n data points [Eq. (B2), Eq. (B3)], the data set actually takes the form

{y1, . . . , yN } = {¯1 ± ¯1, ¯2 ± ¯2 . . . ¯N ± ¯N } . (B5)
To be precise, we have data points along with some error bars in Eq. (B5). The average y is given by

y

(B6)

where we have used Eq. (B4). Consequently, using  = /, we have the following bound,

(1 - )  y  (1 + ).

(B7)

Clearly, lesser the value of , better the convergence
of  to y . This is indeed the case here since  < 10-2  1 as shown in Fig. 17.

8. Now, we look at the standard deviation s¯y of the sample data set yj-s in Eq. (B5). One can show that

9. As already explained in Eq. (B3), the actual stan-
dard deviation ¯y here is connected to the sample standard deviation s¯y as

¯y

(B9)

17

Clearly, this ¯y is our required standard deviation d i.e.

d = ¯y.

(B10)

We present the estimates of d in Fig. 18 and observe that d is sufficiently smaller than  (for all temperatures).

10. Finally, we replace d from Eq. (B10) in Eq. (B1) to

get the required error bar d in all the temperature regimes.
Having presented the detailed procedure above (points 1 to 10), we now plot the  values with the corresponding error bars d in different temperature regimes (Fig. 19). The figure shows that indeed the error bars are sufficiently small and therefore the exponent  undoubtedly can serve as a prominent demarcator of the three different dynamical regimes.
