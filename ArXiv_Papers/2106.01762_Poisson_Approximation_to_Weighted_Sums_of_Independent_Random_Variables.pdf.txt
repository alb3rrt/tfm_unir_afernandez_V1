1 Introduction and Preliminaries

Weighted sums of random variables (rvs) have been successfully applied in the areas related to least-square estimators, non-parametric regression function estimators, and Jackknife estimates, among many others. Such sums are also useful in characterizing various statistics. The exact distributions of weighted sums of rvs are not tractable in general, and therefore its approximation is of interest to study their asymptotic behavior. Limit theorems for weighted sums of rvs have been discussed in the literature, for example, see Chow and Lai [7], Dolera [8], Lai and Robbins [14], Zhang [20], and references therein. Let Yi,n, 1  i  n, be double-indexed independent rvs concentrated on Z+ = {0, 1, 2, . . .}, the set of non-negative integers. Also, define

n
Zn := ciYi,n,
i=1

(1.1)

the weighted sums of double-indexed independent rvs, where ci  N = {1, 2, . . .}, the set of positive integers. We assume ci = 1 for at least one i so that Zn becomes Z+-valued

random variable (rv). Limit theorems for the weighted sums of rvs have been discussed in the literature if the sum of weights is finite. For example, Chow and Lai [7] are considered the finite sum of the square of weights, and Bhati and Rattihalli [5] are considered the geometrically weighted sums. But if the sums of weights are not finite then the study of limit behavior of such distributions becomes challenging. Therefore, in this paper, we consider natural weights and obtain limit theorems for Zn that helps to visualize the behavior of Zn. Next, let X  P, the Poisson distribution, then the probability mass function of X is given by

P(X

=

k)

=

e-k k!

,

k  Z+.

(1.2)

We obtain error bound for X-approximation to Zn. The total variance distance is used as a distance metric. Our results are derived using Stein's method (Stein [17]) which can be followed in three steps. First, for a random variable Y , find a Stein operator A such that E(Ag(Y )) = 0, for g  GY , where GY := {g  G|g(0) = 0, and g(k) = 0 for k / S(Y )}, G := {f |f : Z+  R is bounded}, and S(Y ) is the support of random variable Y . Second, solve the following Stein equation

Ag(k) = f (k) - Ef (Y ), k  Z+ and f  G.

(1.3)

Finally, putting a random variable Z in place of k and taking expectation and supremum,

we have

dT V (Y, Z) := sup Ef (Y ) - Ef (Z) = sup E[Ag(Z)] ,

f I

f I

(1.4)

where I = {1A | A  Z+} and 1A is the indicator function of A. Now, for the random variable X defined in (1.2), the Stein operator is given by

Ag(k) = g(k + 1) - kg(k), for k  Z+ and g  GX

(1.5)

and the solution to the Stein equation (1.3), say gf , satisfies

gf



1 ,

max(1, )

and

gf



1 max(1,

)

,

for f  I, g  GX .

(1.6)

For additional details, see Barbour and Hall [2], Barbour et. al. [3], Chen et. al. [6], Brown and Xia [4], and Kumar et. al. [13]. For recent developments, see Ley et. al. [16], Upadhye and Barman [18], Kumar [12], and references therein. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we obtain the error bound for Poisson approximation to Zn. We show that our bound is better than the existing bound by numerical comparisons. As applications, we also discuss limit theorems for weighted sums of Bernoulli and geometric rvs.

2 Bounds For Poisson Approximation

In this section, we obtain error bound for Poisson approximation to weighted sums of rvs

and discuss some limit theorems. Recall that P follows Poisson distribution with parameter

 > 0 and Zn =

n i=1

ciYi,n

,

where

Yi,n, 1  i  n,

are

double-indexed

rvs.

The

following

theorem gives the upper bound for the total variation distance between Zn and P.

Theorem 2.1. Let Zn and P be defined as in (1.1) and (1.2), respectively. Then

dT V

(Zn, P)



| - EZn| max(1, )

+

1 max(1,

)

n i=1

 j=1

jci|ciE(Yi,n)pi,n(jci)

-

(jci +1)pi,n(jci +1)|,

where pi,n(k) = P(Yi,n = k).

Proof. Replacing k by Zn in (1.5) and taking expectation, we have

E[Ag(Zn)] = E[g(Zn + 1)] - E[Zng(Zn)]

n

n

= ( - EZn)E[g(Zn + 1)] + ciE(Yi,n)E[g(Zn + 1)] - ciE [Yi,ng(Zn)] .

i=1

i=1

(2.1)

Next, let Zi,n = Zn - ciYi,n then Yi,n and Zi,n are independent rvs. Adding and subtracting

n i=1

ciE

[Yi,ng(Zi,n

+

1)]

in

(2.1),

we

get

n
E[Ag(Zn)] = ( - EZn)E[g(Zn + 1)] + ciE(Yi,n)E[g(Zn + 1) - g(Zi,n + 1)]
i=1 n
- ciE[Yi,n(g(Zn) - g(Zi,n + 1))].
i=1

(2.2)

Consider the following expression from the second term in (2.2)

E[g(Zn + 1) - g(Zi,n + 1)] = E[g(Zi,n + ciYi,n + 1) - g(Zi,n + 1)]

= E[g(Zi,n + k + 1) - g(Zi,n + 1)]pi,n,ci(k),
k=0

where

pi,n,ci(k) = P(ciYi,n = k) =

pi,n

k ci

,

if k = jci, j = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,

0,

otherwise.

(2.3)

Note that
k
g(Zi,n + l) = g(Zi,n + k + 1) - g(Zi,n + 1).
l=1
Substituting (2.4) in (2.3), we have

(2.4)

k

E[g(Zn + 1) - g(Zi,n + 1)] =

E[g(Zi,n + l)]pi,n,ci(k).

k=1 l=1

Therefore, the second term of (2.2) leads to

(2.5)

n

nk

ciE(Yi,n)E[g(Zn + 1) - g(Zi,n + 1)] =

ciE(Yi,n)E[g(Zi,n + l)]pi,n,ci(k).

i=1

i=1 k=1 l=1

(2.6)

Similarly,

n

n  k-1

ciE[Yi,n(g(Zn) - g(Zi,n + 1))] =

kE[g(Zi,n + l)]pi,n,ci(k)

i=1

i=1 k=2 l=1

nk

=

(k + 1)E[g(Zi,n + l)]pi,n,ci(k + 1).

i=1 k=1 l=1

(2.7)

Substituting (2.6) and (2.7) in (2.2), we get

nk

E[Ag(Zn)] = ( - EZn)E[g(Zn + 1)] +

ciE(Yi,n)E[g(Zi,n + l)]pi,n,ci(k)

i=1 k=1 l=1

nk

-

(k + 1)E[g(Zi,n + l)]pi,n,ci(k + 1).

i=1 k=1 l=1

Hence,

n

|E[Ag(Zn)]|  | - EZn| g + g

k|ciE(Yi,n)pi,n,ci(k) - (k + 1)pi,n,ci(k + 1)|

i=1 k=1

n

= | - EZn| g + g

jci|ciE(Yi,n)pi,n(jci) - (jci + 1)pi,n(jci + 1)|.

i=1 j=1

Using (1.6) the result follows.

Remark 2.1. Note that the bound given in Theorem 2.1 is an improvement over the bound given in Corollary 2.1 of Kumar [12]. In particular, if Yi,n  Ber(pi,n) then, from Theorem

2.1, we have

dT V (Zn, P) 

n i=1

c2i p2i,n

max (1, )

,

(2.8)

where  =

n i=1

Also,

from

Corollary

of

Kumar

[12],

we

have

with

(2.8) is better than the bound given in (2.9). Also, the bound given in (2.9) seems to be

invalid (q  1) for small values of pi,n. For example, let the values of pi,n be as follows:

Set 2 1-10 0.05 1 11-20 0.04 2 21-30 0.04 3

Then, the following table gives the comparison between the bounds given in (2.8) and (2.9).

Observe that our bounds are better than the bounds given by Kumar [12].

Corollary 2.1. Assume the conditions of Theorem 2.1 holds then, for ci = 1, 1  i  n, we have

dT V

P)



| - EZn| max(1, )

Remarks 2.1. (i) The bound given in Corollary 2.1 is also obtained by Kumar et al. [13, Theorem 3.1]. Therefore, if Yi,n follows power series distribution then all limiting results obtained by Kumar et al. [13] follows as special cases.

(ii) Observe that if Yi,n  P o(i,n) and  =

n i=1

i,n

then

dT V

(Zn, P)

=

0,

as

expected.

(iii) If Yi,n  Ber(pi,n) then it can be easily verified that

dT V

(Zn, P)



| - EZn| max(1, )

n i=1

p2i,n

max (1, )

.

Moreover, if  =

n i=1

then,

we

have

dT V

(Zn, P)



n i=1

p2i,n

max (1, )

,

(2.10)

which is the bound also obtained by Barbour and Hall [2], and an improvement over the bounds given by Le Cam [15] and Kerstan [11].

(iv) If Yi,n  Geo(pi,n) then it can be easily verified that

dT V

(Zn, P)



| - EZn| max(1, )

n

qi,n 2

i=1 pi,n

where qi,n  1/2. Moreover, if  =

n qi,n i=1 pi,n

then,

we

have

dT V (Zn, P) 

n

qi,n 2

i=1 pi,n , max (1, )

(2.11)

which is the bound also obtained by Kadu [10] and Kumar et al. [13], and an improvement over the bounds given by Vellaisamy and Upadhye [19].

From (2.10), if EZn =

n i=1

pi,n





and

max1in pi,n



0

then

Zn

L

P.

Similarly,

from

(2.11), if EZn   and max1in qi,n  0 then Zn L P. For more details, see Examples

3.2 and 3.4 of Kumar et al. [13]. Now, we generalize these two results for weighted sums

considered in this paper. The following examples gives the limiting results for weighted sums

of Bernoulli and geometric independent (non-identical) rvs.

Example 2.1. Let Yi,n  Ber(pi,n) then, from Theorem 2.1, we have

dT V

(Zn, P)



| - EZn| max(1, )

n i=1

c2i

max (1, )



| - EZn| max(1, )

max (1, )

,

where pn = max1in cipi,n. Note that if EZn =

n i=1

ci

pi,n





and

pn



0

then

dT V (Zn, P)  0 as n  . This shows that Zn L P.

Remark 2.2. Observe that if ci = 1 then the conditions in Examples 2.1 and 2.2 reduced to the standard conditions used in Examples 3.2 and 3.4 of Kumar et al. [13], respectively.

Next, we discuss an application of our result to compound Poisson distribution in the following example.

Example 2.3. Let ci = i, Yi,n  P oi(i,n) and Zn =

n i=1

then
