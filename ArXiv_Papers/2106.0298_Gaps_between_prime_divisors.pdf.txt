EFTHYMIOS SOFOS

1. Introduction

What are the typical gaps between the prime divisors of a randomly selected integer? For m P N we let pmq be the number of distinct prime divisors of m and pipmq be the i-th smallest prime divisor of m, so that
log log p1pmq  . . .  log log ppmqpmq
is a finite sequence that depends on m. It is not difficult to show that for almost all m and almost all 1  i  pmq, one has log log pipmq ,, i, hence, log log pi`1pmq ´ log log pipmq is typically bounded. A natural question is to count the number of gaps exceeding a fixed constant z  0, i.e. estimate

zpmq :" 7 t1  i  pmq : log log pi`1pmq ´ log log pipmq  zu .

Erdos [5, pg. 534] was the first to study this question. He showed that for almost all m the function zpmq is well-approximated by e´zpmq by proving an upper bound for the second moment:

`zpmq ´ e´z log log n2 " opplog log nq3{2q, as n Ñ `8.

However, it turns out that this is not of the right order of magnitude. Here we prove asymptotics not just for the second moment, but for all moments:

EFTHYMIOS SOFOS

Setting z " 0 we recover the much celebrated Erdos­Kac theorem [6]. Our method is different from

that of Erdos [5] in that it relies on Stein's method on normal approximations [12]. This allows us

to deal with certain sums of dependent random variables that arise when modelling zpmq. Stein's

method has been rarely used in number theory, for example, by Harper [8].

There

are

many

generalisations

of

the

Erdos­Kac

theorem

to

functions

of

the

form


p|m

gppq

but

they do not cover zpmq, as gppq would have to be a function of m as well. Galambos [7, Theorem

2] studied the values of a function that is somewhat related to our z, namely the cardinality of

i  pmq for which log log pi`1pmq ´ log log pipmq  z ` log log log m. His results and method are rather different as they are suited to values of large gaps, while our result relates to small gaps. A

function similar to Galambos' occurs in the recent work of Chan­Koymans­Milovic­Pagano [2, §4]

on the negative Pell equation.

Remark 1.2. At the cost of a non-self sufficient argument, the number theoretic part of the proof
of Theorem 1.1, (namely, Lemma 2.9) can be alternatively verified via the Kubilius model [4, §12]. The approximation of pmq by e´z log log m means that the gaps in the sequence tlog log pipmqui1 are Poissonian. It is worth mentioning that the occurrence of Poisson distribution in other areas
of Probabilistic Number Theory is not uncommon, see the work of de Koninck­Galambos [3],
Harper [8], Granville [10] and Kowalski­Nikeghbali [11], for example.

2.1. Defining the model.

2. The proof of Theorem 1.1

The letter z will denote a fixed non-negative real number throughout §2. As usual, we denote exppzq :" ez. For a prime p and a positive integer m we define

#

p,zpmq :"

1, 0,

if p | m and m is not divisible by any prime in pp, pexppzqs, otherwise.

In

particular,

z pmq

"


p

p,z

pmq,

where

the

sum

is

over

all

primes.

Our

plan,

initially,

is

to

follow

the Kubilius model idea (see Billingsley [1]) to define Bernoulli random variables Bp that model

the behavior of p,z. For this we use the random variables Xp defined by Kubilius, which in the

notation of Billingsley's work [1, Equation (13)] are given as follows: for every prime p the random

variable Xp is defined so that

P rXp

"

1s

"

1, p

P rXp

"

0s

"

1

´

1 p

and such that Xp are independent. In particular, the mean ErXps equals 1{p, thus, Xp " 1 models the event that a random integer m is divisible by a fixed prime p. Let r¨s denote the integer part.
The independence of Xp is related to the Chinese Remainder Theorem. To model p,z we must also take into account the fact that each prime q in the range pp, pexppzqs
must not divide m. Thus, we are naturally led to define

Bp :" Xp  p1 ´ Xqq.
q prime pqpexppzq

(2.1)

We

will

later

prove

that

the

sense

that

Remark 2.1 (Independence break-down). Definition (2.1) leads to a major difference between this paper and the proofs of the Erdos­Kac theorem, namely, the variables Bp are dependent. Indeed, for all primes p  q with q  pexppzq, the quantity ErBpBqs vanishes while none of ErBps, ErBqs does.
2.2. Distribution and moments of the model via Stein's method.

For any positive N we define SN " ÿ Bp
pN
and denote its expectation and variance respectively by
cN :" E rSN s and s2N :" Var rSN s .
Our goal in this section is to prove that pSN ´ cN q{sN converges in law to the standard normal distribution as N Ñ 8 and that its moments are asymptotically Gaussian. This will be done respectively in Propositions 2.5 and 2.7. We first need a few preparatory estimates.

First note that E "pBp ´ hpq2 " E rBps ´ h2p " hpp1 ´ hpq. Further, if q  pexppzq then Bp and Bq are independent, hence, E rpBp ´ hpqpBq ´ hqqs " 0. If p  q  pexppzq then ErBpBqs vanishes, hence
E rpBp ´ hpqpBq ´ hqqs " ´E rBps hq ´ hpE rBqs ` hphq " ´hphq.

If ti  0 then we get 1{pi from the first product in the outmost right hand side and if ti " 0 then we get a factor 1{prii  1{pi from the second product. This concludes the proof of (2.6).
To verify our lemma it suffices to restrict to the cases with p1  . . .  pu. Observe that if x  maxt0, yu then |y|  maxty, x ´ yu, therefore, for y " Bp ´ ErBps and x " Bp we obtain

|Bp ´ ErBps|  maxtBp ´ ErBps, ErBpsu  maxtBp ´ ErBps, 1{pu.

Combining this with (2.6) allows us to conclude the proof.

Remark 2.6. We next prove asymptotics for the moments of pSN ´ cN q{sN . This is possibly the central proof in the present paper. The argument is a modification of the one by Billingsley [1, Equations (28)-(29)], which relies on a version of the dominated convergence theorem. However, the underlying random variables are now dependent, thus, we need to introduce the notion of linked indices.

We will now show that every sum over pi in (2.14) vanishes. Denoting the cardinality of 1  i  u

with ri " 1 by a we see that the number of i with ri  2 is u ´ a.

Since

get

2k  a ` 2pu ´ aq. Equivalently, 2pu ´ kq  a, hence, by ppq  u ´ k one gets

2ppq  7ti P r1, us : ri " 1u.

(2.15)

We now partition the integers in r1, us into disjoint subsets A1, . . . , Ar using the following rules:
, if i and i ` 1 are in Sj then they are linked, , if i P Sa and i ` 1 P Sb for some a  b then i and i ` 1 are not linked. The inequality s  2p´1 ` sq for s  2 gives

1jr 27Aj

This equals 2ppq since each Aj has ´1 ` 7Aj linked pairs and the total number of links is ppq. By (2.15) we infer that there exists an index j for which rj " 1 and that is not linked to any other index. This implies that the following random variables are independent:

 pBpi ´ ErBpi sqri and pBpj ´ ErBpj sqrj " Bpj ´ ErBpj s.
1iu ij

Since E "Bpj ´ ErBpj s " 0 we infer that every expectation in the right hand side of (2.14) vanishes. This concludes the proof.

2.3. Justifying the model.

Let n be a positive integer and denote by n the uniform probability space N X r1, ns. Our goal now becomes to show that, as n Ñ 8, the moments of zpmq for m in n are asymptotically the same as the moments of SN for some parameter N " N pnq Ñ 8. Recall (2.1). For technical reasons we will first work with a truncated version of z, namely,

ÿ z,N pmq " p,zpmq,

(2.16)

pN

where N " N pnq. The function p,z imposes simultaneous coprimality conditions of m with several primes in large intervals and to deal with this we shall need the Fundamental Lemma of Sieve Theory [9, Corollary 6.10].

Lemma 2.8 (Fundamental Lemma of Sieve Theory). Let P be a set of primes. Given any sequence am  0 for m P N and any square-free d  x that is only divisible by primes in P we assume that

ÿ am " Xgpdq ` rd

for some real numbers X, rd and a multiplicative function g. Assume that 0  gppq  1 and that there exist constants K  1,   0 such that

2.4. Proof of Theorem 1.1. The function N pnq :" n1{ log log n

fulfills (2.18)- (2.19)-(2.23)-(2.24), hence, we can apply Lemmas 2.9-2.10.

This proves Theorem 1.1 whenever r is a positive integer and this is sufficient. To see that, take any r P r0, 8q and note that (2.25) implies that

converges in law to the standard normal distribution. Taking p to be the least even integer strictly exceeding r in [13, Example 2.21] shows that the r-th moment of Tn converges to the r-th moment of the standard normal distribution.
