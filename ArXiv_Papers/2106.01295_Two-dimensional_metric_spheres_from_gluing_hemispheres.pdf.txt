TWO-DIMENSIONAL METRIC SPHERES FROM GLUING HEMISPHERES
TONI IKONEN
Abstract. We study metric spheres (Z, dZ) obtained by gluing two hemispheres of S2 along an orientation-preserving homeomorphism g : S1  S1, where dZ is the canonical distance that is locally isometric to S2 off the seam.
We show that if (Z, dZ) is quasiconformally equivalent to S2, in the geometric sense, then g is a welding homeomorphism with conformally removable welding curves. We also show that g is bi-Lipschitz if and only if (Z, dZ) has a 1quasiconformal parametrization whose Jacobian is comparable to the Jacobian of a quasiconformal mapping h : S2  S2. Furthermore, we show that if g-1 is absolutely continuous and g admits a homeomorphic extension with exponentially integrable distortion, then (Z, dZ) is quasiconformally equivalent to S2.
1. Introduction
In this paper, we work in the unit sphere S2  R3. We denote the equator S2  R2 × {0} by S1 and endow S2 with the length distance  induced by the Euclidean distance of R3. The open southern and northern hemispheres are denoted by Z1 and Z2, respectively. Here (0, 0, 1)  Z2.
Consider an orientation-preserving homeomorphism g : S1  S1, mapping the boundary of Z1 to the boundary of Z2. We identify each z  S1 with its image g(z)  S1. With this identification, we obtain a set Z and inclusion maps 1 : Z1  Z and 2 : Z2  Z. We call SZ = 1(S1) = 2(S1) the seam of Z.
We construct a pseudodistance dZ on Z, see Section 3, making the inclusion maps local isometries off the seam and 1-Lipschitz everywhere. We consider the quotient map Q : Z  Z identifying points x, y  Z whenever dZ(x, y) = 0, and endow Z with the associated quotient distance.
We are interested in this construction for the following reason: whenever the metric space Z is quasiconformally equivalent to S2, there exist Riemann maps 1 : Z1  1, 2 : Z2  2 onto the complementary components of a Jordan curve C with g = 2-1  1|S1; with the Carathéodory theorem we can make sense of the composition 2-1  1|S1 [GM05]. Any such g is called a welding homeomorphism and C a welding curve. A long-standing problem is to understand which homeomorphisms g satisfy 2-1  1|S1 for some Riemann maps. We refer to the survey articles [Ham02], [You15] for further background information.
We also investigate the properties of Z, given an arbitrary welding homeomorphism g. We show in Section 4 that the 1-dimensional Hausdorff measures on the seam Q(SZ) and on (the tangents of) C are closely connected, using results from classical complex analysis [GM05]. For example, our results show that a given subarc of the welding curve has tangents only in a set negligible to the 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure if and only if the quotient map Q collapses the corresponding part of the seam to a point.

We present in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 examples illustrating that for some homeomorphisms g, after removing a portion E of the seam Q(SZ), one can find a 1-quasiconformal embedding  : Z \ E  S2, but not necessarily a quasiconformal homeomorphism  : Z  S2. A similar phenomenom was investigated in [Ham91] and [Bis07b] in more detail.
We now state our first result.

Theorem 1.1. Let g : S1  S1 be an orientation-preserving homeomorphism. The following are quantitatively equivalent.

(1) g is L-bi-Lipschitz; (2) there exists an L-bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism  : Z  S2; (3) there exists C  0 such that for every y  Q(SZ),

C.

In the implications "(1)  (2)" we may take L = L, in "(2)  (3)" C = (L)4, and in "(3)  (1)" L = C.

We prove "(1)  (2)" by observing that if g : S1  S1 admits an L-bi-Lipschitz extension  : Z2  Z2, the space Z has an L-bi-Lipschitz parametrization. That we may take L = L in "(1)  (2)", follows by applying a known planar extension
result [Kal14] and stereographic projection. The claim "(2)  (3)" is a straightforward consequence of the properties of
Hausdorff measures. The implication "(3)  (1)" is proved by carefully analyzing the behaviour of the inclusion mappings i : Zi  Z at the equator S1. Notice that the i are 1-Lipschitz everywhere and local isometries outside the equator. This implies C  1 in (3). Remark 5.9 shows two ways to improve the bi-Lipschitz constant C. The improvements imply that as C  1+ in (3), the bi-Lipschitz constant of g converges to one. In particular, (3) holds with C = 1 if and only if
g is an isometry.
Theorem 1.1 is closely related to the following result.

Theorem 1.2. If an orientation-preserving homeomorphism g : S1  S1 is L-bi-
Lipschitz, there exists a 1-quasiconformal homeomorphism  : S2  Z and a K-quasiconformal homeomorphism h : S2  S2 such that the Jacobians satisfy

(1)

C-1 Jh(x)  J(x)  CJh(x) for HS22 -a.e. x  S2

for K = L4 and C = L2. Conversely, if there exists K, C, and h for which (1) holds, then g is (KC)2-bi-Lipschitz.

The Jacobians are defined in Section 2.3. We note that if h : S2  S2 is an orientation-preserving quasiconformal homeomorphism, the Jh coincides with the usual distributional Jacobian; see for example [AIM09, Section 3.8].
If g is L-bi-Lipschitz, the existence of  and h is a straightforward consequence of the implication "(1)  (2)" in Theorem 1.1. If h and  exist, we first check that  = h  -1 is bi-Lipschitz and use the implications "(2)  (3)  (1)" from
Theorem 1.1 to verify that g is bi-Lipschitz. Theorem 1.2 is a special case of the quasiconformal Jacobian problem: which
weights  : S2  [0, ] are comparable to the Jacobians of quasiconformal homeomorphisms h : S2  S2; see [BHS04], [Bis07a], and references therein for further
reading. Given that (1) and (3) are equivalent in Theorem 1.1, it is not entirely clear
for which classes of homeomorphisms one can expect Z to be quasiconformally

METRIC SPHERES FROM GLUING HEMISPHERES

equivalent to S2, or what kind of geometric properties one can expect from such a Z.
Question 1.3. Let Z be the metric space obtained from a homeomorphism g : S1  S1. When can we find a quasiconformal homeomorphism  : Z  S2? What kind of restrictions does this impose on g?
As an example, if g is a welding homeomorphism corresponding to the von Koch snowflake, then dZ(x, y) = 0 for every pair of points in the seam, see Remark 4.2. Hence Z can fail to be quasiconformally equivalent, or homeomorphic, to S2 when g is a quasisymmetry. We show that a simple measure-theoretic assumption removes this obstruction.
Proposition 1.4. Let g : S1  S1 be a quasisymmetry whose inverse is absolutely continuous. Then Z is quasiconformally equivalent to S2.
The absolute continuity of g-1 is used in two ways. First, it guarantees that Z = (Z, dZ). Second, if  : Z2  Z2 is a quasisymmetric extension of g, we show that the homeomorphism H : S2  Z satisfying H|Z1 = 1 and H|Z2 = 2  |Z2 is quasiconformal. A key step in the proof is showing the Sobolev regularity H-1  N1,2(Z, S2); the absolute continuity of g-1 is applied here.
Proposition 1.4 is a special case of the following stronger result.
Theorem 1.5. Let g : S1  S1 be an orientation-preserving homeomorphism whose inverse is absolutely continuous. If g extends to a homeomorphism  : Z2  Z2 for which |Z2 has exponentially integrable distortion, then Z is quasiconformally equivalent to S2.
We now explain the main steps of the proof of Theorem 1.5. We first show that there exists a homeomorphism H : S2  Z with exponentially integrable distortion. We also have H-1  N1,2(Z, S2); see Remark 6.8. The exponential integrability of distortion of H is used to verify the reciprocality condition of Z, see Definition 2.5. Then [Raj17, Theorem 1.4] shows that Z is quasiconformally equivalent to S2. The key ingredients in the proof are the condenser estimates for mappings of exponentially distortion [KO06], applicable because H-1  N1,2(Z, S2), and the Stoilow factorization theorem [AIM09, Chapter 20]. There are some known criteria which guarantee that g admits an extension as in Theorem 1.5; see [Zak08] [KN21].
In Section 7.1, we present an example of g : S1  S1 that is locally bi-Lipschitz outside a single point, but for which Z is not quasiconformally equivalent to S2. This illustrates that the absolute continuity of g-1 is not enough to guarantee that Z is quasiconformally equivalent to S2. This fact is a consequence of the following result, partially answering Question 1.3.
Theorem 1.6. Suppose that g : S1  S1 is an orientation-preserving homeomorphism for which there exists a quasiconformal homeomorphism h : S2  Z. Then Z = (Z, dZ) and there exists a 1-quasiconformal homeomorphism  : S2  Z. Furthermore, g is a welding homeomorphism whose welding curves are conformally removable.
The first step in the proof of Theorem 1.6 is showing that h can be assumed to be 1-quasiconformal. Then, up to an orientation-reversing Möbius transformation, i = h-1  i : Zi  S2 are Riemann maps with welding curve C = h-1(Q(SZ)) and welding homeomorphism 2-1  1|S1 . The equality Z = (Z, dZ)

and the conformal removability of C follow from a connection we show between the tangents of the welding curve C and the Hausdorff 1-measure on the seam Q(SZ); see Section 4. The equality Z = (Z, dZ) implies g = 2-1  1|S1 .
We recall that a compact proper subset K  S2 is conformally removable if every homeomorphism M : S2  S2 conformal in S2 \ K is Möbius. The von Koch snowflake example illustrates that conformal removability of a welding curve C is not enough to guarantee even that Z is homeomorphic to S2. We refer the
reader to [You15] and [You18] for further reading on conformal weldings and the connections to conformal removability. See [HK03] for some results in the context
of Theorem 1.5.
The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we introduce our notations and some preliminary results. In Section 3, we analyze the distance dZ induced by any given homeomorphism g : S1  S1. When g is a welding homeomorphim,
we establish in Section 4 a connection between the geometry of the seam SZ and the tangents of the corresponding welding curves C. We also prove Theorem 1.6 in this section. In Section 5, we prove Theorems 1.1 and 1.2. Proposition 1.4
and Theorem 1.5 are proved in Section 6. In Section 7, we give some concluding remarks.

2.1. Notation. Let (Y, dY) be a metric space. We sometimes drop the subscript from dY when there is no chance for confusion. For all Q  0, the Q-dimensional

Let  : [a, b]  X be an absolutely continuous path. Then the (path) integral of a Borel function  : X  [0, ] over  is

If  is rectifiable, then the path integral of  over  is defined to be the path
integral of  over the arc length parametrization s of ; see [HKST15, Chapter 5] for further details.
Given a Borel set A  Y, the length of a path  : [a, b]  Y in A is defined as Y A(y)#(-1(y)) dHY1 (y), where #(-1(x)) is the counting measure of -1(x). For A = Y, [Fed69, Theorem 2.10.13] states

() = Y #(-1(y)) dHY1 (y).

When  is rectifiable, for every Borel function  : Y  [0, ],

Y (y)#(-1(y)) dHY1 (y).

The equality (4) follows from [Fed69, Theorem 2.10.13] via a standard approximation argument using simple functions.

2.2. Metric Sobolev spaces. In this section we give an overview of Sobolev theory in the metric surface setting, and refer to [HKST15] for a comprehensive introduction.
Let  be a family of paths in Y. A Borel function  : Y  [0, ] is admissible for  if the path integral   ds  1 for all rectifiable paths   . Given 1  p < , the p-modulus of  is
modp  = inf Y p dHY2 , where the infimum is taken over all admissible functions . Observe that if 1 and 2 are path families and every path 1  1 contains a subpath 2  2, then modp 1  modp 2. In particular, this holds if 1  2. When p = 2, and there is no chance for confusion, we omit the subscript from mod2.
If  is admissible for a path family  \ 0, where modp 0 = 0, we say that  is p-weakly admissible for . If a property holds for every path    except in a subfamily of p-modulus zero, the property is said to hold on p-almost every path in . We also refer to 2-almost every path as almost every path.
We recall the following lemma [HKST15, Lemma 5.2.8].
Lemma 2.1. Let 1  p < . A family of nonconstant paths  satisfies modp  = 0 if and only if there exists  : Y  [0, ],   Lp(Y) with

Let  : (Y, dY)  (Z, dZ) be a mapping between metric spaces Y and Z. A Borel function  : Y  [0, ] is an upper gradient of  if

dY((x), (y))   ds


for every rectifiable path  : [a, b]  Y connecting x to y. The function  is a

p-weak upper gradient of  if the same holds for p-almost every rectifiable path.

further details. Minimal 2-weak upper gradients are also refered to as minimal

weak upper gradients.

Fix a point z  Z, and let dz = dZ(·, z). The space Lp(Y, Z) is defined as the collection of measurable maps  : Y  Z such that dz   is in Lp(Y). Moreover,

Notice that Ii  [0, 1] \ -1(E) for every i. Let Ji = Ii. Then v(s)  (  |Ji )(s) L1-almost everywhere on Ji (on Ii).

2.3. Measure theory. Let Y be a Borel subset of a complete and separable metric
space. A Borel measure µ on Y is -finite if there exists a Borel decomposition {Bi}i=1 of Y for which µ(Bi) <  for every i.
A pair of -finite Borel measures µ and  on Y are said to be mutually singular if there exists a Borel set B  Y such that µ(B) = 0 and (Y \ B) = 0. The measure µ admits a Lebesgue decomposition (with respect to ), where µ = f ·  + µ, with µ and  mutually singular and f Borel measurable [Bog07, Sections 3.1-3.2 in Volume I]. We say that µ and  are mutually absolutely continuous if µ = f ·  with
density f > 0 -almost everywhere.

METRIC SPHERES FROM GLUING HEMISPHERES

Given a homeomorphism  : Y  Z and measures  on Y and µ on Z, the measure µ(B) = µ((B)) is called the pullback measure. Such a measure admits a decomposition µ = f ·  + µ with  and µ mutually singular. If  = HY2 and µ = H2Z, the density f is called the Jacobian of  and denoted by J.
2.4. Quasiconformal mappings. Here we define quasiconformal maps and recall some basic facts.

Definition 2.3. Let (Y, dY) and (Z, dZ) be metric spaces with locally finite Hausdorff 2-measures. A homeomorphism  : (Y, dY)  (Z, dZ) is quasiconformal if there exists K  1 such that for all path families  in Y

(5)

K-1 mod   mod   K mod ,

where  = {   :   }. If (5) holds with a constant K  1, we say that  is K-quasiconformal.

A special case of [Wil12, Theorem 1.1] yields the following.

Theorem 2.4. Let Y and Z be locally compact separable metric spaces with locally finite Hausdorff 2-measure and  : Y  Z a homeomorphism. The following are equivalent for the same constant K > 0:
(i) mod   K mod  for all path families  in Y. (ii)   Nl1o,c2(Y, Z) and satisfies
2(y)  K J(y)
for HY2 -almost every y  Y.
The outer dilatation of  is the smallest constant KO  0 for which the modulus inequality mod   KO mod  holds for all  in Y. The inner dilatation of  is the smallest constant KI  0 for which mod   KI mod  holds for all  in Y. The number K() = max {KI(), KO()} is the maximal dilatation of .
For a set G  Y and disjoint sets F1, F2  G, let (F1, F2; G) denote the family of paths with each path starting at F1, ending at F2 and whose images are contained in G. A quadrilateral is a set Q homeomorphic to [0, 1]2 with boundary Q consisting of four boundary arcs, overlapping only at the end points, labelled 1, 2, 3, 4 in cyclic order.
A metric surface is a separable metric space Y with locally finite Hausdorff 2measure that is homeomorphic to a (connected) 2-manifold without boundary.

Definition 2.5. A metric surface Y is reciprocal if there exists a constant   1 such that

(6)

-1  mod  (1, 3; Q) mod  (2, 4; Q)  

for every quadrilateral Q  Y, and

(7)

lim mod 
r0+

for all y  Y and R > 0 such that Y \ BY(y, R) = .

We note that for every metric surface,

(8)

0-1  mod  (1, 3; Q) mod  (2, 4; Q) ,

with 0 = (4/)2 [EP21] [RR19].

Theorem 2.6 (Theorem 1.4 of [Raj17]). Let (Y, dY) be a metric surface homeomorphic to R2 or to S2. Then there exists a quasiconformal embedding  : (Y, dY)  S2 if and only if Y is reciprocal.

8

TONI IKONEN

Theorem 1.3 of [Ikoar] shows that if a metric surface (Y, dY) can be covered by quasiconformal images of domains V  R2, then (Y, dY) is quasiconformally equivalent to a Riemannian surface. In particular, we have the following.
Theorem 2.7. Let (Y, dY) be a metric surface homeomorphic to S2. Then there exists a quasiconformal homeomorphism  : (Y, dY)  S2 if and only if each point y  Y is contained in an open set U from which there exists a quasiconformal homeomorphism  : U  V  R2.
Since (8) holds, we have the following result.
Proposition 2.8 (Corollary 12.3 of [Raj17]). Let Y be a metric surface, U  Y a domain, and  : U    R2 a homeomorphism. If KO() < , then  is K-quasiconformal for K = (2 · 0) · KO().

3. Hemispheres

We construct a (pseudo)distance dZ on Z using a predistance D : Z × Z  [0, ]

defined in the following way, with the identification SZ  Z1 for the seam,

,

if (x, y)  Z1 × Z2  Z2 × Z1,

D(x,

y)

=

m(ixn,

{(x, y),

y),

(g(x),

g(y))} ,

if x, y  SZ, otherwise.

Then we denote dZ(x, y) = inf ni=1 D(xi, xi+1), the infimum taken over finite chains (xi)in=+11 for which x1 = x and xn+1 = y. We obtain a metric space Z and a quotient map Q : Z  Z by identifying (x, y)  Z × Z whenever dZ(x, y) = 0, and setting dZ(x, y) = dZ(Q-1(x), Q-1(y)) for each x, y  Z.
In this section, we focus on analyzing the distance dZ on the seam SZ. The main results of this section are Lemmas 3.2 and 3.3 and Proposition 3.6.
In the following two lemmas we abuse notation and identify i(Zi) with Zi when convenient.

Lemma 3.1. The following hold:

(1) oLtehtexr,wyise.ST1 henZ1 ani=n1dD((xxi)i,in=x+1i1+1a)chaDin(wx,iyth). x1 = x, xn+1 = y, and xi  Z1

(Txhi)ein=n+11ani=c1hDai(nxwi, xitih+1g)(x1

) = g(x), D(x, y).

g(xn+1)

=

g(y),

Proof. Given the chain from the claim (1), for every i, D(xi, xi+1) = (xi, xi+1). Thus, ni=1 D(xi, xi+1)  (x1, xn+1)  D(x1, xn+1). The corresponding inequalities hold for the chain from (2).

Lemma 3.1 implies that when computing dZ(1(x), 1(y)) for x, y  S1, it is sufficient to consider chains with intermediate points staying within the seam.

Lemma 3.2. If x, y  Z1, then

(x, y), or there exist w, w  S1 with (9) dZ(1(x), 1(y)) = (x, w) + dZ(1(w), 1(w)) + (w, y)  (x, y).

The corresponding identity holds for points x, y  Z2. Furthermore, if x  Z1 and y  Z2, there exist w, w  S1 such that

(10)

dZ(1(x), 2(y)) = (x, w) + dZ(1(w), 1(w)) + (g(w), y).

Proof. We show (9). Suppose that there exists a sequence j  0+ and a sequence of chains (xi,j)in=j+11 joining x to y with dZ(1(x), 1(y))  -j + ni=j 1 D(xi,j, xi+1,j) so that every chain has an element in S1. If i1 is the first index for which xi,j  S1 and i2 the last one, then
nj
 D(xi,j, xi+1,j)  (x, xi1,j) + dZ(1(xi1,j), 1(xi2,j)) + (xi2,j, y)
i=1
 inf (x, w) + dZ(1(w), 1(w)) + (w, y) ,
the infimum taken over every w, w  S1. Observe that the infimum is realized by some w, w  S1. Given such w, w  S1, we pass to the limit j   and conclude
dZ(1(x), 1(y))  (x, w) + dZ(1(w), 1(w)) + (w, y).
Since "" holds for every pair w, w  S1, the lower equality in (9) follows. If no such sequence of j  0+ exists, then there exists 0 > 0 such that
for every 0 >  > 0, any chain joining x to y with dZ(1(x), 2(y))  - + ni=1 D(xi, xi+1) does not intersect S1. Hence ni=1 D(xi, xi+1)  (x, y). So, either way, we obtain (9). The claims for each x, y  Z2 and (x, y)  Z1 × Z2 are proved in a similar manner.

For i = 1, 2, we denote i := Q  i : Zi  Z. Lemma 3.2 implies that i is 1-Lipschitz everywhere and a local isometry in Zi. We also establish that i is monotone, i.e, the preimage of a point is a compact and conected set.

Lemma 3.3. For i = 1, 2, the inclusion map i : Zi  Z is 1-Lipschitz everywhere and a local isometry on Zi. Moreover, for every z  Z, the preimage -i 1(z) is compact and connected. It contains two or more points only if -i 1(z)  S1.
Before proving Lemma 3.3, we show two auxiliary results.

Lemma 3.4. Let x, y  S1 be distinct. Then there exists an arc  : [0, 1]  S1 joining x to y with D(1(x), 1(y)) = min {(), (g  )}. The arc satisfies
n

the supremum taken over finite partitions of [0, 1]. In particular, D(1(x), 1(y))  (1()).

Proof. The existence of  with D(1(x), 1(y)) = min {(), (g  )} follows from the fact that  is geodesic on S1. We identify 1(x) with x for every x  S1 in the following computations.
The claim about the partitions is a consequence of the following observation and induction: If 0  a < s < b  1, then

(11)

D((a), (b))  D((a), (s)) + D((s), (b)).

We first assume that D((a), (b)) = ((a), (b)). Then  is a length-minimizing geodesic joining (a) and (b). Consequently,

((a), (b)) = ((a), (s)) + ((s), (b)).

Since (c, d)  D(c, d) holds for every c, d  S1, the inequality (11) holds in this case. In the remaining case, g   is a length-minimizing geodesic joining g((a)) and g((b)) and

(g((a)), g((b))) = (g((a)), g((s))) + (g((s)), g((b))).

Since (g(c), g(d))  D(c, d) for every c, d  S1, the inequality (11) holds also in this case.
The partition claim implies D(x, y)  ni=1 dZ(1((ti)), 1((ti+1))) for every partition {ti}in=+11 of [0, 1]. The inequality D(x, y)  (1()) follows by taking the supremum over such partitions.

Lemma 3.5. Let x, y  S1 be distinct. Then there exists an arc  : [0, 1]  S1 joining x to y such that dZ(1(x), 1(y)) = (1()).

Proof. Let  > 0. The defining property of dZ and Lemma 3.1 imply the existence of a chain {xi}in=+11  S1 joining x to y for which

n
dZ(1(x), 1(y))  - +  D(1(xi), 1(xi+1)).
i=1

For each i, Lemma 3.4 yields the existence of an arc i : [0, 1]  S1 joining xi to

xi+1 with D(1(xi), 1(xi+1))  (1(i)). Let  denote the concatenation of these

paths. Then dZ(1(x), 1(y))  - + (1()). Let  : [0, 1]  S1 be an arc joining x to y within the image of . Applying (4)

on Z with   Z implies that (1())  (1()). Such a  is one of the arcs joining x to y within S1.

Let j  0+ and consider j as above for every such j. Up to passing to

and

relabeling,

we

may

assume

that

every

such



 j

is

the

same

arc . Passing to the limit j   establishes dZ(1(x), 1(y))  (1()) 

dZ(1(x), 1(y)). We set  =  to conclude the proof.

Proof of Lemma 3.3. The claimed 1-Lipschitz and local isometry properties follow of 1 from Lemma 3.2. The local isometry property implies that given z  Z, the preimage -1 1(z) has more than two points only if the preimage is a subset of S1.
Suppose the existence of a distinct pair x, y  -1 1(z). Then x, y  S1. Lemma 3.5 shows that there exists an arc  joining x to y within S1 satisfying
0 = dZ(1(x), 1(y)) = (1()). This implies ||  -1 1(z). Since x and y were arbitrary, we conclude that -1 1(z) is path connected. Consequently, -1 1(z) is a connected and compact subset of S1.
The properties of 2 follow from a symmetry in the argument. Hence the claim follows.

Proposition 3.6. Let g : (S1, HS11 )  (S1, HS11 ) be a homeomorphism with gHS11 = vgHS11 + µ with HS11 and µ mutually singular. Then, for every Borel set B  S1,

(12)

H1dZ (1(B)) =

min 1, vg
B

dHS11 = 1(B) #(-1 1(z)) dH1Z(z).

Moreover, for every x, y  S1, there exists an arc ||  S1 joining x to y for which

(13)

dZ(1(x), 1(y)) = (1()).

Before proving Proposition 3.6, we first consider a Carathéodory construction on S1. First, fix a Borel set B0  S1 for which HS11 (B0) = 0 and µ(S1 \ B0) = 0. Set ABS(B) := B min 1, vg S1\B0 dHS11 for all Borel sets B  S1.
For every arc  : [0, 1]  S1, we denote  ABS(||) := ABS(||) and (||) := D((0), (1)). The set function  ABS and the family of arcs ||  S1 yields
Carathéodory premeasures ABS for each  > 0.

Lemma 3.7. For every Borel set B  S1, we have ABS(B) = sup>0 ABS(B) 

H1

(1(B)).

Proof. The equality ABS(B) = sup>0 ABS(B) follows from the fact that ABS is a finite Borel measure.
We denote B1 = vg  1  B0 and B2 = S1 \ B1. If B  S1 is Borel, we have

2
H1Z(1(B)) =  H1Z(1(B  Bi))  HS11 (B  B1) + HS11 (g(B)  g(B2)) i=1

since i is 1-Lipschitz for i = 1, 2. The right-hand side equals ABS(B). Therefore

Lemma 3.8. Let x, y  S1 be distinct and  : [0, 1]  S1 an arc joining x to y such

that

=

Then

dZ(1(x),

Proof. Let /2 > 0 > 0 be such that

D(1(a), 1(b)) < 0 implies max {(a, b), (g(a), g(b))} < /2.

Given such a pair a, b  S1, the length-minimizing geodesic  : [0, 1]  S1 joining

a to b satisfies (||) = min {(), (g  )}. Then (||)   ABS(||).

Let  be as in the claim. Let 0 <  < 0 and 0 <  < /2. We consider a

partition {ti}in=+11 of [0, 1] such that ((ti), (ti+1)) < /2 for every i. Then there

exists a chain

D(1(xi,j),

In particular, D(1(xi,j), 1(xi,j+1)) <  < 0 for every j. Hence the length-

minimizing geodesic i,j joining xi,j to xi,j+1 satisfies the assumptions of Lemma 3.4.

For every i, Lemma 3.4 implies that, up to further partitioning the paths i,j and

relabeling, we may assume (xi,j, xi,j) <  for every j. Given this property, we

conclude D(1(xi,j), 1(xi,j+1)) = (|i,j|)   ABS(|i,j|) and

Since the concatenation i of

H1Z(1()) = (1())  min ABS(||), ABS(S1 \ ||) .

If we had ABS(||) > ABS(S1 \ ||), this would contradict Lemma 3.7 and the

length-minimizing property of 1(). Hence ABS(||)  ABS(S1 \ ||), and

We claim that (12) holds. To this end, we consider three arcs i : [0, 1]  S1 overlapping only at their end points, whose images cover S1, with the arcs

forces

the

The

#(-1 1(x)) = 1 H1Z-almost everywhere follows from the monotonicity of 1 and the

integrability of the multiplicity. The integrability of the multiplicity follows from

(3).

Remark 3.9. We consider a 2-periodic doubling measure µ on R with 2 =

µ([0, 2]) such that for some Borel set B  [0, 2], L1(B) = 0 = µ([0, 2] \ B),

the existence of which is established by Ahlfors­Beurling [BA56, Section 7]. Then

with    = g  , where (t) = (cos(t), sin(t), 0). Then vg in (12) is identically

zero. Consequently, dZ  0 on the seam SZ.

4. Harmonic measure and welding homeomorphisms

We consider a welding homeomorphism g : S1  S1 and a welding circle C
with complementary components 1 and 2, Riemann maps i : Zi  i for i = 1, 2, and g = 2-1  1|S1. In this section, we consider the harmonic measures i(E) = iHS11 (E)/(2) for all Borel sets E  S2.
We define a homeomorphism  : S2  (Z, dZ) and a quotient map  : S2  Z via the formulas

(14)

(x) =

1  1-1(x), 2  2-1(x),

when x  1, and  = Q  . when x  2

Recall that Q : Z  Z is the quotient map identifying x, y  Z whenever dZ(x, y) = 0. Lemma 3.3 implies that  is monotone and -1(x) contains two or more points only if x is a point of the seam Q(SZ), and in such a case -1(x)  C.
For  = 1, 2, we denote, for every Borel set B  S2,

(15)

HZ(B) := Z #(B  -1(x)) dHZ(x) = HZ((B)),

where the multiplicity can be ignored in the case  = 2 since it equals one outside

the negligible set Q(SZ). For  = 1, the multiplicity is two or more only when it is  and this happens in a set of negligible H1 -measure. Either way, the multiplicity
Z
is negligible in (15), so the second equality is justified.

Proposition 4.1. Let g be a welding homeomorphism with a welding circle C
and I  C a subarc. Then dZ((x), (y)) = 0 for all x, y  I if and only if 1|I and 2|I are mutually singular. If such an interval exists, then Z is not quasiconformally equivalent to S2.

Remark 4.2. If g is a welding homeomorphism obtained from Remark 3.9 or any welding g corresponding to the von Koch snowflake [GM05, Example 4.3], Proposition 4.1 implies that Q(SZ) is a singleton. In particular, Z is not even

METRIC SPHERES FROM GLUING HEMISPHERES

13

homeomorphic to the sphere. For a given g, this happens if and only if gHS11 and HS11 are mutually singular.
A key step in the proof of the conformal removability in Theorem 1.6 is the following.

Proposition 4.3. Let g be a welding homeomorphism and  as in (14). Then  is continuous, monotone, and surjective. Moreover, for all path families  on S2, mod   mod . The metric space Z is quasiconformally equivalent to S2 if and
only if  is a homeomorphism for which mod  = mod  for all path families.

The proof of Proposition 4.3 requires some preparatory work. Given the curve C, we say that x0  C is a tangent point if there exists a homeomorphism  : (-, )  C  C with (0) = x0, and a tangent vector v0  Tx0S2 with unit length such that for every smooth f : S2  R, its differential d f satisfies

d f (v0)

=

lim
t0+

f ((t)) - f (x0) ((t), x0)

and

d f (-v0)

=

lim
t0-

f

((t)) - ((t),

f (x0) x0)

.

If v0 exists, the tangent vector v0 is independent of the parametrization  and C up to multiplication by -1; see [GM05, Chapter II, Section 4]. The collection of tangents points of C is denoted by Tn(C). The key properties of Tn(C) are self-contained in the following statement.

Lemma 4.4. The Borel set Tn(C) has -finite Hausdorff 1-measure. Moreover, on the set Tn(C), the measures 1, 2, and H1C are mutually absolutely continuous.
Given any Borel set E  C with 1(E) · 2(E) > 0, the restrictions 1|E and 2|E are mutually singular on E if and only if H1C (Tn(C)  E) = 0.
Proof. The Borel measurability of Tn(C) follows from [GM05, Chapter II, Theorem 4.2] which connects the tangents of C and the angular derivatives of any given Riemann map 1 : Z1  1, where 1 = C. The fact that Tn(C) has -finite Hausdorff 1-measure follows from [GM05, Chapter VI, Theorem 4.2].
Theorem 6.3 of [GM05, Chapter VI] states that if a Borel set E  C is such that 1(E) · 2(E) > 0, then 1|E and 2|E are mutually singular on E if and only if H1C (Tn(C)  E) = 0.
The fact that on the set Tn(C) the measures 1, 2, and H1C are mutually absolutely continuous follows from [GM05, Chapter VI, Theorem 4.2 and the following discussion on p. 211].

We denote h = vg  1-1 and observe the equality 2 = h1 + (1)µ. Then (16) is equivalent to

Lemma 4.4 implies that the measures C\Tn(C)1 and C\Tn(C)2 are mutually
singular. Consequently, h = 0 1-almost everywhere in C \ Tn(C). In particular, if B = C \ Tn(C), the left-hand side equals zero in (17).
Lemma 4.4 yields that the measures Tn(C)1, Tn(C)2 and Tn(C)H1C are mutually absolutely continuous. Hence  > h > 0 1-almost everywhere in Tn(C).
This implies that the measure in (17) is mutually absolutely continuous with the
measures Tn(C)1, Tn(C)2 and Tn(C)H1C . The claim follows from the equalities (15) for  = 1.

Lemma 3.3 shows that Z = (Z, dZ) if and only if there exists a closed arc I  S1 such that y = 1(I). Assume that such an I exists. Having fixed x0  Z1 and 0 < s < (x0, S1), there exists c = c(x0, I, s) for which

mod (I, BS2 (x0, s); I  Z1)  c > 0;

a positive lower bound can be shown, for example, by estimating the modulus of
all geodesics joining I to BS2 (x0, s) in I  Z1. When R > 0 is small enough, for every R > r > 0 and every path in
(I, BS2 (x0, s)); I  Z1), we find a subpath  : [0, 1]  Z1 so that 1   joins
BZ(y, r) to Z \ BZ(y, R) within BZ(y, R). Since 1 is a local isometry off the seam, this implies

lim inf mod 
r0+

BZ(y, r), Z \ BZ(y, R); BZ(y, R)

 c.

Recalling Theorem 2.6, we see that Z is not quasiconformally equivalent to S2.

Lemma 4.6. For i = 1, 2, let i : i  [0, ] denote the operator norm of the differential of D(i-1). Then

(18)

G = 1 1 + 2 2 +  · Tn(C)  L2(S2)

is a weak upper gradient of .

Proof. The L2-integrability of G follows from the change of variables formulas of
the Riemann maps 1 and 2 and the fact that Tn(C) has negligible area. Hence, as a consequence of Lemma 2.1, G is integrable along almost every absolutely continuous path  : [0, 1]  S2. Given such a , we claim that

(19)

dZ(((0)), ((1))) 

G ds,


implying that G is a weak upper gradient of .
Since G is integrable along ,  has negligible length in Tn(C). Then (4) implies HS12 (Tn(C)  ||) = 0. We conclude H1Z((C)  |  |) = 0 from Lemma 4.5. The assumptions of Lemma 2.2 are satisfied and the conclusion (  )   G ds follows. The inequality (19) is a consequence.

We define the Jacobian of  to be the density of H2 , defined in (15), with
Z
respect to HS22 .

Lemma 4.7. The mapping  satisfies Lusin's Condition (N) and the Jacobian J coincides with G2 HS22-almost everywhere, with G being from (18).

Proof of Proposition 4.3. The claimed topological properties of  were already ver-

ified at the beginning of this section. Lemmas 4.6 and 4.7 prove that J = G2  L1(S2) with G being a weak upper gradient of . This fact and the fact that

Lastly, we argue that a K-quasiconformal map  : Z  S2 exists (for some

K  1) if and only if  is a 1-quasiconformal homeomorphism. The "if"-direction

is obvious.

In the "only if"-direction, the fact that  is a homeomorphism follows from

Proposition 4.1. So h =    : S2  S2 is a homeomorphism satisfying mod  

K mod h for all path families . Theorem 2.4 and [AIM09, Definition 3.1.1 and Theorem 3.7.7] prove that h is K-quasiconformal. Consequently,  is K-

quasiconformal for some K  K2. This self-improves to K = 1 due to Lemma 4.8

below. This yields mod  = mod  for all path families.

Lemma 4.8. Suppose that  : S2  Z from (14) is a homeomorphism. Then  : S2  Z is 1-quasiconformal if and only if for every 1-Lipschitz h : S2  R, h  -1  N1,2(Z).

Proof. The "only if"-claim is clear, given Theorem 2.4 (ii). In the "if"-direction, fix

a 1-Lipschitz h : S2  R for now.

Consider the Borel function G : S2  [0, ] defined on Lemma 4.6. Then  =

1/G  -1 is such that 2 is the Jacobian of -1, as a consequence of Lemma 4.7.

Hence   L2(Z).

Given that h  -1



N1,2

and

H2
Z

(Q(SZ))

= 0, for almost every  :

[0, 1]



Z, the composition (h  -1)   is absolutely continuous,  has negligible length

on the seam Q(SZ), and   ds < . Indeed, the absolute continuity of (h  -1)   for almost every path follows from [HKST15, Proposition 6.3.2]. The fact

that almost every path has negligible length on Q(SZ) follows from Lemma 2.1 and the L2-integrability of  · Q(SZ). Similarly, the conclusion   ds <  follows from Lemma 2.1 and the L2-integrability of .

If we denote E = (h  -1)(||  Q(SZ)), the absolute continuity of (h  -1)   implies HR1 (E) = 0. Then Lemma 2.2 yields ((h  -1)  )    ds. We conclude that  is a weak upper gradient of h  -1.

Since  is independent of h and h is an arbitrary 1-Lipschitz function, Theorem

7.1.20 [HKST15] shows that  is a weak upper gradient of -1. Since 2 is the

Jacobian of -1, we conclude KO(-1) = 1. Recall KO() = 1 from Proposi-

tion 4.3.

Remark 4.9. If the welding curve C happens to be rectifiable, the Hausdorff 1-
measure on C and Tn(C)H1C are mutually absolutely continuous [GM05, Chapter VI, Theorem 1.2 (F. and M. Riesz)]. With this fact at hand, Lemma 4.5 implies
that  is a homeomorphism. Moreover, one can show that h  -1  N1,2(Z) for every 1-Lipschitz h : S2  R. Hence  is 1-quasiconformal.

16

TONI IKONEN

Proof of Theorem 1.6. Suppose the existence of a quasiconformal homeomorphism  : Z  S2. Up to postcomposing  by an orientation-reversing Möbius transformation of S2, we may assume that i :=   i|Zi : Zi  S2 is orientationpreserving for i = 1, 2. Let C = (Q(SZ)).
The set S2 \ C is the disjoint union of Jordan domains 1 and 2, where i is the image of i for i = 1, 2. Proposition 4.1 implies (Z, dZ) = Z.
Next, since  : Z  S2 is a quasiconformal homeomorphism,  satisfies Lusin's Condition (N) [Raj17, Section 17]. Consequently, C has zero 2-dimensional Haus-
dorff measure. We consider the Beltrami differential µ = 1 µ1 + 2 µ2, where µi is the Bel-
trami differential of i-1. If h : S2  S2 is a normalized solution to the Beltrami equation induced by µ [AIM09, Measurable Riemann mapping theorem],
the mapping  = h   is 1-quasiconformal. Since C has zero measure, this is
readily verified by hand or by applying [Ikoar, Theorem 4.12].
We have verified that (Z, dZ) = Z and we may assume that  : (Z, dZ)  S2 is 1-quasiconformal with i =   i|Zi being Riemann maps [AIM09, Weyl's lemma]. The definition of Z implies that g = 2-1  1|S1. Consequently, g is a welding homeomorphism.
In order to show the removability of C := (SZ), we are given an orientationpreserving homeomorphism M : S2  S2 conformal in the complement of C. Then  := -1  M-1 defines a mapping as in (14) for the curve C = M(C). Proposition 4.3 implies that  is 1-quasiconformal. Consequently, M-1 =   
is 1-quasiconformal, i.e., a Möbius transformation.

5. Mass upper bound

In this section, we prove Theorems 1.1 and 1.2. We first consider the implication "(3)  (1)". Recall that we are given an orientation-preserving homeomorphism g : S1  S1 and the canonical quotient map Q : Z  Z. We are assuming the existence of a constant C > 0 for which

In order to make transparent how C and the Lipschitz constants of g (resp. g-1) are related to C in (20), we define C1, C2  0 to be the smallest constants for
which

Recalling from Lemma 3.3 the fact that the inclusion maps are 1-Lipschitz and
local isometries outside the seam, the limit infimums in (21) and (22) are bounded from below by 1/2. Hence, C1, C2  2-1. Since the seam is negligible, we have 1  C1 + C2  C.
We show that the constant C1 in (21) and the Lipschitz constant L1 of g-1 are connected via the following function

Definition 5.1. For every C  1/2, L = L(C)  1 denotes the unique positive number such that for every 0 <   L-1, f ()  C. Equivalently, L = 1/ f -1(C).

Remark 5.2. We note that for every 0 <   1, we have f ()  ()-1. We use this fact during the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Proposition 5.3. If (21) holds with constant C1 and L1 = L(C1) is as in Definition 5.1, then g-1 is L1-Lipschitz and 1 : Z1  Z satisfies for every x, y  Z1, (x, y)  dZ(1(x), 1(y))  (x, y)/L1.

The symmetry in the argument yields the following result.

Proposition 5.4. If (22) holds with constant C2 and L2 = L(C2) is as in Definition 5.1, then g is L2-Lipschitz and 2 : Z2  Z satisfies for every x, y  Z2, (x, y)  dZ(2(x), 2(y))  (x, y)/L2.
We start the proof of Proposition 5.3. We consider the decomposition gHS11 = vgHS11 + µ with µ and HS11 being singular. We fix a Borel representative of vg.
Let f be as in (23). The following statement holds for every Z.

Proposition 5.5. Given 1 >  > 0 and a HS11-density point x0  S1 of E := vg   , we have

Proof. For the duration of the proof, we fix normal coordinates F : B(0, /2)  S2 centered at x0 in such a way that the preimage of S1  B(x0, /2) is (-/2, /2) × {0} [Lee18, Section 5]. Recall that this means that F is an isometry along radial geodesics and the metric has the expansion gij(x) = ij + O( x 22) in these coordinates. In particular, as r  0+, the bi-Lipschitz constant of F|B(0,r) is of the form 1 + O(r2). We denote (s) := F(s, 0) for |s|  /2.
We fix 0 <  < 1/ - 1. Since x0 is a density point of E, there exists s0 < /2 such that for every 0 < s  s0,

(25)

HS11 ( ([-s, s]) \ E)  s.

We fix 0 < r  s0. Then, for every 0 < s < r/, Proposition 3.6 yields for both I = [0, s] and I = [-s, 0],

(26)

(E  (1  |I ))  s.

Since 1 is 1-Lipschitz according to Lemma 3.3, (25) and (26) imply

(27)

(1  |I)  s + s = (1 + )s < s.

We denote for every |s| < r/((1 + )), s = r - (1 + )|s|. For each z

geodesics, so

We use this inclusion in a circular sector C(r) which has a total angle 2 and an angle bisector {0} × R.
The second term in the brackets is twice the area of a suitable triangle. The
factor of two comes from the symmetry of the estimate (27) with respect to the parameter s = 0. We consider a triagle T(r)  R2 foliated by line segments (s), where 0  s < r/((1 + )), with (s) having the start point (s, 0), tangent in the direction (sin(), cos()), and has length a/(1 + O((r/)2)). The 1  F image of such a triangle T(r) contributes to Ar. The inequality (28) follows.
We choose the angle  to satisfy sin() = (1 + ). We divide (28) by r2, pass to the limit r  0+, and then   0+ and conclude

The inequality (24) is the same as (29).

Remark 5.6. Given 0 <  < 1, the lower bound in (29) is sharp. This can be shown
by considering a bi-Lipschitz g : S1  S1 with metric speed vg   everywhere in
an open neighbourhood of x0  S1. If the circular sector C(r) and triangle T(r) are defined as in the proof of the

This can be showed using Lemma 3.2 and Proposition 3.6. The key property of the angle  is that the line on R2 containing (r/, 0) with tangent vector
(- cos(), sin()) intersects every ball BR2 ((s, 0), s) tangentially when 0  s < 1/ and s = 1 - s.

Proof of Proposition 5.3. Given (21) and Proposition 5.5, we have vg(x)  L1-1 for HS11-almost every x  S1. This implies that g-1 is absolutely continuous and vg-1 (x)  L1 for HS11 -almost every x  S1. Therefore g-1 is L1-Lipschitz.
The fact that 1 1-Lipschitz follows from Lemma 3.3. Proposition 3.6 implies that
dZ(1(x), 1(y))  (x, y)/L1 for every x, y  S1.

The equality Lemma 3.2 (9) implies the corresponding inequality for every pair x, y  Z1. Hence -1 1 is L1-Lipschitz.

Next, we verify a lemma about radial extensions of bi-Lipschitz maps, which we need during the proof of Theorem 1.1.
For the south pole P1  Z1, we consider the (orientation-reversing) stereographic projection P : S2 \ {P1}  R2 × {0} fixing the equator and mapping the north pole P2 = (0, 0, 1) to the origin. We identify R2 × {0} with R2. We note that P-1 has the explicit definition

The Riemannian tensor of S2 in these coordinates is I = (4/(1 + r2)2)gE, where r is the distance to the origin and gE the Euclidean inner product. In polar coordinates, gE = dr2 + r2d2. We see from the form of I that the bi-Lipschitz constant of g = P  g  (P|S1 )-1 and g : S1  S1 coincide.
We represent the polar coordinates using the complex notation rei. We note that there exists a homeomorphism G : R  R with g(ei) = eiG() for every   R. For every 0  r  1 and   R, we set (rei) := reiG() and refer to  as the radial extension of g. We recall from [Kal14, Theorem 2.2] that the bi-Lipschitz constants of g and  coincide. Let  = P-1    P|Z2 : Z2  Z2.
We use the following fact during the proof of Lemma 5.8; see for example [DCJS16], [CS20].
Lemma 5.7. For every x, y  S2, 0 <  < 1, and 0 < 4r < (x, y), the modulus of the family of paths joining BS2(x, r) to BS2 (y, r) with length (1 + )(x, y) is positive.
Lemma 5.8. The map  : Z2  Z2 is L-bi-Lipschitz if g is L-bi-Lipschitz.
Proof. We refer the interested reader to [Kal14, Section 2] for the proof of the fact that  is bi-Lipschitz if g (equivalently g) is bi-Lipschitz. We take this as a given.
Since  is bi-Lipschitz, it has a differential at L2-almost every point in D. Given this fact, the following computations are understood to hold at L2-almost every (x, y) = rei in the unit disk.
The pullback  I is a diagonal matrix with respect to the basis (dr, d), with diagonal 4/(1 + r2)2 and 4|G()|2r2/(1 + r2)2. Hence the maximum of the operator norms of D : (TD, I)  (TD, I) and its inverse is equal to L(rei) =
max |G()|, |G()|-1 . Then, if L denotes the essential supremum of L(rei),
Lemma 5.7 implies that  is L-bi-Lipschitz. On the other hand, L is the biLipschitz constant of g.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. We first claim that "(1)  (2)". Lemma 5.8 provides us with an L-bi-Lipschitz  : Z2  Z2 extension of the given L-bi-Lipschitz g. We define H(x) = 1(x) for each x  Z1 and H(x) = 2  (x) otherwise. Proposition 3.6 implies that H is L-bi-Lipschitz at the seam, and Lemma 3.2 implies that H is L-bi-Lipschitz everywhere.
Notice that if H : S2  Z is L-bi-Lipschitz, we may choose C = (L)4 as an upper bound for the 2-dimensional Hausdorff lower density. Hence "(2)  (3)" follows, quantitatively. Lastly, "(3)  (1)" follows from Propositions 5.3 and 5.4. In fact, given C  1 for which the lower density bound (20) holds, g is L-biLipschitz for L solving C = f (1/L). Since f ()  1/ for every 0 <   1, we have C  L. Hence g is C-bi-Lipschitz.
Remark 5.9. The estimates between the constants in "(3)  (1)" in Theorem 1.1 can be improved in two ways. First, the constants C1 and C2 in (21) and (22) satisfy max {C1, C2}  C - 1/2, so g is (C - 1/2)-bi-Lipschitz.
The second improvement is obtained by using the constant L = L(C - 1/2) from Definition 5.1. Then g is L-bi-Lipschitz, where L  (C - 1/2).
These improvements imply that the bi-Lipschitz constant of g converges to 1 as C  1+. These facts also improve Theorem 1.2 and the following result, Proposition 5.10.
Before proving Theorem 1.2, we investigate a related problem. To this end, suppose that we are given Riemann maps i : Zi  i with 1 and 2 denoting the complementary components of a welding curve C, and set g = 2-1  1|S1.

20

TONI IKONEN

Proposition 5.10. Let K, C  1. The welding homeomorphism g is (KC)2-biLipschitz if there exists a K-quasiconformal homeomorphism h : S2  S2 such
that for both i = 1, 2,

(30)

C-1 Jh(x)  Ji-1 (x)  CJh(x) for HS22 -a.e. x  i.

Conversely, if g is L-bi-Lipschitz, then there exists L4-quasiconformal homeomorphism h : S2  S2 such that (30) holds for C = L2.

Proof. We first assume that g : S1  S1 is L-bi-Lipschitz. Then Theorem 1.1 provides us with an L-bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism  : Z  S2. Proposition 4.3 and (14) imply that  : S2  Z defined via the formula

(31)

(x) =

1  1-1(x), 2  2-1(x),

x  1, x  2

is a 1-quasiconformal homeomorphism. Therefore, h :=    : S2  S2 is K-
quasiconformal for K = L4, and as  is L-bi-Lipschitz, the Jacobians of h and  are comparable with comparison constant C = L2.
Next, we are given a Jordan curve C  S2 corresponding to a welding homeomorphism g = 2-1  1|S1 , a K-quasiconformal homeomorphism h : S2  S2, and a constant C  1 such that

(32)

C-1 Jh(x)  J(x)  CJh(x) HS22 -a.e. x  S2 \ C.

For i = 1, 2, the composition h  i is K-quasiconformal with Jacobian bounded from above C and below by C-1, respectively; here we apply (32). Theorem 2.4 (ii)

and Hadamard's

inequality imply that C-1  2hi implies that the homeomorphism

 KC h  i

HS22 -almost everywhere is locally L-bi-Lipschitz

Since, for both i = 1, 2, Zi is geodesic, it is immediate that h  i : Zi  S2 is L-Lipschitz. Since this holds for both i = 1, 2, the construction of dZ implies that whenever x, y  S1, (h  1(x), h  1(y))  LdZ(1(x), 1(y)). Lemma 3.2 (9) establishes the same inequality for each x, y  Z1. Hence the mapping  defined by the expression (31) is a homeomorphism and  := h  -1 is L-Lipschitz on the southern hemisphere. A similar argument shows that  is L-Lipschitz on both of the hemispheres. Then Lemma 3.2 (10) implies that  is L-Lipschitz

everywhere.

Since mod   K mod -1 for all path families (recall Proposition 4.3), we

have -1  N1,2(S2, Z). On the other hand, (Q(SZ)) has negligible HS22 measure and -1 is locally L-Lipschitz in the complement of that set. In par-

We have verified that  is L-bi-Lipschitz. By applying the implications "(2) 

(3)  (1)" in Theorem 1.1, we conclude that g is L-bi-Lipschitz for L = (L)4 =

(KC)2.

Next, we prove Theorem 1.2. This essentially follows from Proposition 5.10.

METRIC SPHERES FROM GLUING HEMISPHERES

21

Proof of Theorem 1.2. We claim that g : S1  S1 is bi-Lipschitz if and only if there exists a quasiconformal homeomorphism h : S2  S2 and a 1-quasiconformal homeomorphism  : S2  Z such that J and Jh are comparable.
If such  and h exist, we may assume that i = -1  i|Zi is a Riemann map for both i = 1, 2. Then Proposition 5.10 shows that g is bi-Lipschitz.
Conversely, if g is bi-Lipschitz, Theorem 1.1 provides a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism  : Z  S2. Then Theorem 1.6 implies the existence of a 1-quasiconformal homeomorphism  : S2  Z such that i = -1  i|Zi is a Riemann map for i = 1, 2. We may also assume that   i|Zi is orientation-preserving for i = 1, 2, by post-composing  with a suitable reflection, if need be. Defining h =   
implies that the assumptions of Proposition 5.10 hold for g.
Since Theorem 1.1 and Proposition 5.10 are quantitative, so is Theorem 1.2.

6. Mappings of finite distortion

In this section, we establish Proposition 1.4 and Theorem 1.5.

Definition 6.1. Let ,   S2 be open. A homeomorphism  :    is a mapping of finite distortion if   N1,1(, S2); second, the determinant J(D) of
the differential D is nonnegative and integrable; lastly, there exists a function 1  K <  for which

(33)

|D|2g  K J(D) HS22-a.e. in .

Here |D|g refers to the operator norm of the differential D. We let K denote a smallest Borel function which is bounded from below by  and for which (33)
holds.

Definition 6.2. A smooth strictly increasing function A : [1, )  [0, ) is admissible if

(1) A(1) = 0,

(2) (3)

We obtain the same class of admissible A if we replace (2) with the condition

This follows from the fact that A(s)/s

and the integration by parts formula.

Definition 6.3. Let ,   S2 be open, and  :    a homeomorphism. We say that  is admissible if  is a mapping of finite distortion and there exists an admissible A with

(34)

 eA(K) dHS22 < .

If A(t) = pt - p for some p > 0, we say that  has exponentially integrable distortion.

We recall some properties of such . First,  satisfies Lusin's Condition (N) [KKM+03, Theorem 1.1]. Second, -1  N1,2(, ) [KO06, Corollary 1.2]; this implies that -1 satisfies Lusin's Condition (N) [AIM09, Theorem 3.3.7]. Third,
the Jacobian J(D) appearing on the right-hand side of (33) coincides with the Jacobian J we defined in Section 2.2 [KKM+03].
In this section, we show the following theorem.

22

TONI IKONEN

Theorem 6.4. Suppose that g : S1  S1 is a homeomorphism, g-1 absolutely continuous, and there exists a homeomorphism  : Z2  Z2 extending g with |Z2 admissible. Then Z is quasiconformally equivalent to S2.
Note that Theorem 1.5 is a consequence of Theorem 6.4 so it suffices to verify Theorem 6.4.
Definition 6.5. Given x0  S1 and  > R0 > 0, set Q := BS2 (x0, R0)  S2. We define H(x) = 1(x) if x  Q  Z1 and 2  (x) if x  Q  Z2, and denote R = H(Q)  Z.

Proposition 6.6. If R and H are as in Definition 6.5, then H is a homeomorphism
and there exists a 1-quasiconformal homeomorphism f = (u, v) : R  [0, 1] × [0, M] for some M > 0.

Proof of Theorem 6.4 assuming Proposition 6.6. We cover the seam in Z by the interi-
ors of R as in Definition 6.5. This implies that Z can be covered by quasiconformal images of planar domains, and the quasiconformal equivalence of Z and S2 follows from Theorem 2.7.

The following lemma is a key step in proving Proposition 6.6.

Lemma 6.7. The H from Definition 6.5 is a homeomorphism, H  N1,1(Q, R) and H-1  N1,2(R, Q). Furthermore, H satisfies Lusin's Conditions (N) and (N-1).

Proof. The absolute continuity of g-1 implies for the Lebesgue decomposition gH1 = vgH1 + µ that vg = 0 has negligible HS11 -measure in an open neigh-
bourhood of S1  Q. Then Proposition 3.6 and Lemma 3.2 imply that H is a

homeomorphism.

We recall from Lemma 3.3 the fact that the inclusion maps 1|Z1 : Z1  Z and 2|Z2 : Z2  Z are 1-Lipschitz local isometries. This implies that H and its inverse are absolutely continuous in measure; the seam has negligible Hausdorff

2-measure.

In the following proof, we write i for functions defined on Q  Zi  S2 and i = (i  -i 1) on R  i(Zi)  Z for i = 1, 2.
Since -1  N1,2(Q  Z2, S2), for i = 1, 2, there exists an upper gradient i 

L2(Q  Zi) of H-1  i|ZiQ for i = 1, 2. We fix such functions and denote  := R1(Z1)1 + R2(Z2)2  L2(R).

Let 0 denote the collection of non-constant paths on R  Z which have pos-

itive length in the seam Q(SZ) or along which  fails to be integrable. Since

 +  · Q(SZ) is L2-integrable, Lemma 2.1 yields mod 0 = 0.

Consider next an absolutely continuous path  : [0, 1]  R in the complement

of 0. Then  = H-1   is such that HS12 (||  S1) = 0. Indeed, since  has

zero

length

in

the

seam,

the

area

formula

(4)

implies

H1 (||

=

0.

This

implies HS11 (||  S1) = 0 due to Proposition 3.6 and the absolute continuity of

g|S-11Q. Since HS11 (||  S1) = 0, the assumptions of Lemma 2.2 are satisfied.

Hence

()   ds < .


This implies that H-1 has an L2-integrable weak gradient, so H-1  N1,2(R, Q).

Lastly, we claim that H  N1,1(Q, R). To this end, we observe that HQZi has an upper gradient i  L1(Q  Zi), and denote  = 2i=1 QZi i  L1(Q). Now

METRIC SPHERES FROM GLUING HEMISPHERES

 is integrable along 1-almost every absolutely continuous path  : [0, 1]  Q and 1-almost every such path has zero length in S1. Having fixed a path  with these properties, Proposition 3.6 implies that  = H   has zero length in the
seam. The inequality ()    ds follows from Lemma 2.2. This yields that H  N1,1(Q, R).

Remark 6.8. The Sobolev regularity H-1  N1,2(Q, R) is crucial in the following.
Typically, the Sobolev regularity of the inverse of a Sobolev homeomorphism is a
subtle issue in the metric surface setting.
To highlight the issue, we recall [IRar, Example 6.1]. There an example of
a metric surface X was constructed for which there exists a 1-Lipschitz homeomorphism H : R2  X with mod   mod H for all path families, but H-1  N1,2(X, R2). In fact, H is a local isometry outside a Cantor set E  R × {0} of positive L1-measure and H(E) has negligible H1X-measure. The key point is that X is not reciprocal; recall Definition 2.5.

We define the following auxiliary function for later use:

t2,

0  t < 1,

P(t)

:=



t2 A-1(log

t2)

,

t  1.

We note that for every a  [0, ),

(35)

P(a)  eA(KH) + a2 KH

for HS22 -a.e. in Q.

This follows by first observing that a2 < eA(KH) implies P(a)  eA(KH) and other-

wise

P(a)



a2 KH

.

Also, for any measurable function  : Q  [0, ],

(36)

P() dHS22 <  implies

 dHS22 < .

Q

Q

The implication (36) follows since A(t)t is increasing for large t and converges

to infinity as t  . Consequently, there exists t1  1 for which the derivative

of h(t) = eA(t)/t2 is bounded from below by h(t)/t for every t  t1. This implies

the existence of t0  1 such that h(t)  1 for every t  t0. This is equivalent to

saying that P(t)  t for every t  t0. This yields (36).

We set K(x) = |D|2g /J(D())(x) and K-1 (x) =

D(-1)

2 g

/ J ( D(-1)).

Observe that K = K-1   HS22 -almost everywhere.

We set KH(x) = 1 if x  Q  Z1 and KH(x) = K(x) in x  Q  Z2. Then

(37)

Q eA(KH) dHS22 < .

Having observed Lemma 6.9 and (37), the capacitary estimate [KO06, Theorem 5.3] implies that keeping r0 fixed in (38), we obtain mod H(z, r, r0)  0 as r  0+. A key point is that A in (37) is admissible. Since H is a homeomorphism, this implies that (7) holds for every y  int(R)  Z. By repeating the argument with
a slightly larger Q, we conclude the following.

Lemma 6.10. The identity (7) holds for every y  R  Z.

Fix a decomposition 1, 2, 3, 4 of Q of four arcs overlapping only at their end points, labelled in cyclic order consistently with the orientation of S2. For

each i, we denote i = H(i). Given the validity of (7) for each y  R and the universal lower bound (8),

[Raj17, Proposition 9.1] yields the existence of a homeomorphism f = (u, v) : R  [0, 1] × [0, M] with the following properties:

· u  N1,2(R) with 2E(u) =: M [Raj17, Section 4];

· u-1(0) = 1, u-1(1) = 3, v-1(0) = 2, and v-1(M) = 4 [Raj17, Theorem

5.1 and Proposition 7.3];

· The minimal weak upper gradient u is weakly admissible for the path

family (1, 3; R) and is a minimizer, i.e., M = mod (1, 3; R) [Raj17,

Section 4-5];

· For every Borel set E  R, L2( f (E)) =

E

2u

dH2
Z

.

In particular, the

Jacobian of f coincides with 2u [Raj17, Proposition 8.2].

The third point implies that if u  N1,2(R) has the same boundary values as u

in 1  3, the Dirichlet energies satisfy E(u)  E(u). Given this, we say that u is

an energy minimizer for (1, 3; R).

During the proof of Proposition 6.11, the Beltrami differential of H is defined

to be zero in int(Q)  Z1, and coincide with the one of  in int(Q)  Z2.

Proposition 6.11. The map f = (u, v) : R  [0, 1] × [0, M] is a 1-quasiconformal homeomorphism.

The proof of Proposition 6.11 is split into several lemmas.

Lemma 6.12. Let 0 < a < b < 1 and 0 < c < d < M for which Q0 = x  R : f (x)  [a, b] × [c, d]  int(R) \ Q(SZ).

Then f |int(Q0) is a 1-quasiconformal homeomorphism.

Proof. For the duration of the proof, we denote

20 = f -1([0, 1] × {c}),

There exists a Jordan domain V  int(Q)  Zi, for some i = 1, 2, such that i(V) = Q0. Equation (57) [Raj17, Lemma 10.2] states that

mod

(

30;

Q0)

=

c a

.

Since i is 1-Lipschitz and a local isometry in V, we have for every quadrilateral Q  Q0,

(39)

mod (1 , 3 ; Q) mod (2 , 4 ; Q) = 1.

In particular, we have

(40)

mod (10, 30; Q0) mod (20, 40; Q0) = 1.

We wish to apply [Raj17, Proposition 11.1]. There Rajala assumes that (6) holds for some   1 and concludes that 2000 · u is a weak upper gradient of f . We
do not assume this. However, a quick inspection of the proof shows that given any open set   int(Q0), the property (39) implies that 2000 · int(Q0) · u is a weak upper gradient of f |int(Q0) in . By exhausting int(Q0) by such open sets, we conclude that f |int(Q0)  N1,2(int(Q0); R2).
Since u  N1,2(R) is a continuous energy minimizer, the composition u  i|V is harmonic [AIM09, Weyl's lemma]. The Riemann mapping theorem, the Sobolev
regularity of f |int(Q0), the boundary values of the components of f |Q0 , and (40) imply that f  i|V is a Riemann map. In particular, f |int(Q0) is a 1-quasiconformal homeomorphism.

Lemma 6.13. The composition f = f  H : Q  [0, 1] × [0, M] is an element of N1,1(int(Q), R2). Moreover, the Beltrami differential of f coincides with the one of H and (37) holds for K f in place of KH.

Proof. Given Lemma 6.12, the Beltrami differential of f and H coincide HS22almost everywhere in int(Q) \ S1, i.e., HS22-almost everywhere in int(Q). The result also implies that the pointwise distortions of f and H coincide HS22-almost
everywhere in int(Q). Next, we show that u = u  H  N1,1(Q). We recall that H  N1,1(Q, R).
Moreover, if 0  L2(R) is an upper gradient of u, the function  = (0  H)H is a 1-weak upper gradient of u with

Q P() dH2Z 

Q eA(KH) dH2Z +

2 L2(Q)

<

,

where we apply (35) and the distortion inequality 2H  KH JH. The L1(Q)integrability of  follows from (36), so u  N1,1(Q).
Let v = v  H. Lemma 6.12 implies that  = (0  H)H  L1(Q) is a 1-weak upper gradient of v in every open U  int(Q) \ S1. Therefore, v  N1,1(int(Q) \ S1). Given the continuity of v, we actually have v  N1,1(int(Q)). This is seen by verifying the ACL (absolute continuity on lines) property for v|int(Q) on charts covering S1  int(Q). The ACL property on charts follows from a minor modification of the proof in [Väi71, Theorem 35.1] showing that closed sets with -finite Hausdorff 1-measure are quasiconformally removable. This implies that  is a
1-weak upper gradient of v on int(Q). The claim follows from this.

Lemma 6.14. Let u denote the energy minimizer for (2, 4; Q). Then v = Mu.

26

TONI IKONEN

Proof. Similarly to f and f , let f  = (u, v) and f  denote the homeomorphisms obtained from the energy minimizer u for (2, 4; R). Let R denote the image of f  and R the image of f .
Lemma 6.13 shows that the Beltrami differentials of f and f  coincide with one another HS22-almost everywhere and their distortion satisfies (37) for an admissible A. Then the Stoilow factorization theorem [AIM09, Theorems 20.5.1, 20.5.2] implies that  = f   f -1 is conformal; note also that  = f   f -1.
Since  is conformal, the energy minimizer 1 for ( f (2), f (4); R) is such that 1   is the energy minimizer for ( f (2), f (4); R). On the other hand, here 1 is the projection to the x-axis and 1   is M-1 times the projection to the y-axis. Since  = f   f -1, the equality u = 1    f = M-1v follows.
Proof of Proposition 6.11. Lemma 6.14 implies that f = (u, v)  N1,2(R, R2). Furthermore, Lemma 6.12 implies 2f = J f  L1(R). Hence mod   mod f  for
every path family in R. This improves to K-quasiconformality for some K  1
due to Proposition 2.8. As f (Q(SZ)  R) is negligible due to the change of variables formula for f , and as f -1 is 1-quasiconformal outside f (SZ  R), we immediately obtain mod   mod f -1 for every path family in f (R). Thus f is 1-quasiconformal.

Proof of Proposition 6.6. This is proved by Proposition 6.11.

Remark 6.15. Notice that if Lemma 6.10 holds for a given homeomorphism g : S1  S1 having an admissible extension, even without assuming the absolutely continuity of g-1, the rest of the proof of Proposition 6.11 (and Proposition 6.6) go through the same way.
Proof of Proposition 1.4. Given a quasisymmetry g : S1  S1, its Beurling­Ahlfors extension  : Z2  Z2 is a quasisymmetry and |Z2 is K-quasiconformal for some K  1 [BA56]. Thus, if g-1 is absolutely continuous, g satisfies the assumptions of Theorem 1.5. Alternatively, if H is as in Definition 6.5, Lemma 6.9 implies that H-1 has outer dilatation KO(H-1)  K. Proposition 2.8 implies that H is quasiconformal; this self-improves to K-quasiconformality. Clearly H extends to a K-quasiconformal homeomorphism H : S2  Z.

7. Concluding remarks

7.1. A point of positive capacity. For a general orientation-preserving homeomorphism g : S1  S1, the Z can have points of positive capacity (in the sense that (7) can fail) even if g is locally bi-Lipschitz in the complement of a single point. For example, having fixed arbitrary 1 <  < , we consider the homeomorphism h : R  R defined by

x,

x  0,

(41)

h(x) = - (-x), x < 0.

We construct a homeomorphism g : S1  S1 by restricting h to the interval [-1, 1],
extending the restriction to R periodically, and by considering the covering map (t) = (cos(t), sin(t), 0), and a homeomorphism g : S1  S1 satisfying g   =   h-1. Then g-1 is an L-Lipschitz homeomorphism for some L  1, and one
can check directly from the definition of dZ that the inclusion map 1 : Z1  Z is L-bi-Lipschitz onto its image.

Let x0  Z denote the point corresponding to (1, 0, 0). By using the techniques from Section 5, we can show that Z \ {x0} can be covered by bi-Lipschitz images of planar domains. Then [Ikoar, Theorem 1.3] implies that Z \ {x0} is 1-quasiconformally equivalent to a Riemannian surface (that is homeomorphic
to a planar domain). Such a Riemannian surface can be conformally embedded into S2 [AS60, Section III.4]. Hence there exists a 1-quasiconformal embedding  : Z \ {x0}  S2.
We claim that the complement of the image of  is a non-trivial continuum
(which is equivalent to the failure of (7) at x0). Indeed, otherwise  would extend to a 1-quasiconformal homeomorphism and g would be a welding homeomor-
phism, as a consequence of Theorem 1.6. This would contradict both [Oik61,
Example 1] and [Vai89, Theorem 3], where both of these result show that g is not
a welding homeomorphism. In contrast, if we set  =   1 in (41), the homeomorphism g is a quasisymme-
try, so Z is quasiconformally equivalent to S2, as a consequence of Proposition 1.4.

7.2. Points of positive capacity. We construct another example for which points

of positive capacity occur. To this end, consider a Cantor set E  [0, 1] and

(42)



h(x)

=

(L1([0, x,

1]

\

E))-1

x 0

R\E(y)

dL1(y),

0  x  1, otherwise.

Then h : R  R is a Lipschitz homeomorphism coinciding with the identity map
outside (0, 1).
Next, consider the Möbius transformation 1(z) = (z - i)/(z + i) from the upper half-space H onto the Euclidean unit disk D. Let 2(x, y) = (2x/(1 + x2 + y2), 2y/(1 + x2 + y2), (1 - x2 - y2)/(1 + x2 + y2)). Then  := 2  1 : H  Z2 defines a 1-quasiconformal homeomorphism, given that 2-1 is a(n orientationreversing) stereographic projection.
There exists a unique homeomorphism g : S1  S1 satisfying g   =   h-1. We see from (42) that g-1 is L-Lipschitz and 1 is L-bi-Lipschitz with a constant L depending only on L1(E). In particular, Z = (Z, dZ).
We denote E = 2((E))  Z, and apply [Ikoar, Theorem 1.3] as in Section 7.1, and find a 1-quasiconformal embedding  : Z \ E  S2.
Consider on R2 the distance dE obtained as follows: For each absolutely continuous  : [0, 1]  R2, denote E() :=  R2\E ds. We set dE(x, y) = inf E(), the infimum taken over absolutely continuous paths joining x to y.
We denote X = (R2, dE). The change of distance map H : R2  X is a 1-Lipschitz homeomorphism that is a local isometry on R2 \ E. Moreover, if  : [0, 1]  R2 is absolutely continuous, the metric speeds satisfy

We consider a Cantor set E obtained from [IRar, Example 6.1]. The key prop-

erty of E is the following: there exists a path family  on [0, 1]2, each path joining

(0, 0) to (1, 0), such that mod H  (4)-1 and mod  = 0. Given that G is

28

TONI IKONEN

1-quasiconformal, the points 2((x)), where x = (0, 0), (1, 0), fail (7). Consequently, Z is not quasiconformally equivalent to S2, and the embedding  does not have a quasiconformal extension  : Z  S2.
Question 7.1. Are there Cantor sets E with L1(E) > 0 such that a quasiconformal embedding  : Z \ E  S2 extends to a quasiconformal homeomorphism  : Z  S2?
Given a compact set F  Y with Y = R2 or Y = S2, we say that F has zero absolute area if every 1-quasiconformal embedding f : Y \ F  S2 satisfies HS22 (S2 \ f (Y \ F)) = 0.
We expect that the quasiconformal extension  exists if and only if the set F = S2 \ (Z \ E) has zero absolute area; the "only if"-direction follows by applying the techniques used in Section 4, by noting that the composition ( f  )-1 has a continuous, monotone, and surjective extension  with mod   mod  for all path families. We expect that the "if"-direction follows from [IRar, Theorems 1.3 and 1.4, together with Lemma 5.1].
If E in Question 7.2 has zero absolute area, [IRar, Theorem 1.3] implies that the change of distance map H is a 1-quasiconformal homeomorphism. Given that the G above is 1-quasiconformal, one readily verifies that 2 is a 1-quasiconformal homeomorphism onto its image. We ask the following.
Question 7.2. Let E, g, and  be as in Question 7.1. If 2 : Z2  Z is a 1quasiconformal parametrization of its image, does  : Z \ E  S2 extend to a quasiconformal homeomorphism  : Z  S2?
In particular, if E has zero absolute area, does F = S2 \ (Z \ E) have zero absolute area?
It follows from [Iko20, Theorem 1.1 and Proposition 1.2] that the inclusion map 2 is a 1-quasiconformal homeomorphism if and only if there exists a quasiconformal homeomorphism h : 2(Z2)  D, where D is the closed Euclidean unit disk.
7.3. Welding homeomorphisms. We consider a welding homeomorphism g : S1  S1 with welding curve C  S2. Consider the monotone mapping  : S2  Z obtained from (14).
Question 7.3. If  is a homeomorphism, is it a 1-quasiconformal homeomorphism?
We showed in Proposition 4.1 that if  is not a homeomorphism, then Z is not quasiconformally equivalent to S2; the collapsing creates points of positive capacity -- by which we mean that (7) fails -- in Z. Question 7.3 asks if the collapsing is the only obstruction for quasiconformal uniformization. Lemma 4.8 reduces the question to understanding when -1  N1,2(Z, S2).
7.4. Quasisymmetries. Observe that the assumptions of Proposition 1.4 are satisfied by every quasisymmetry g : S1  S1 that is strongly quasisymmetric [Sem86] [Bis88] [AZ91] [BJ94]: for every  > 0 there exists  > 0 such that for every subarc I  S1 and Borel set E  I,
HS11 (E)  HS11 (I) implies HS11 (g(E))  HS11 (g(I)).
The welding curves corresponding to strongly quasisymmetric homeomorphisms are special cases of the asymptotically conformal quasicircles; see [Pom78]. One might ask whether or not Z is quasiconformally equivalent to S2 whenever g is a

METRIC SPHERES FROM GLUING HEMISPHERES

welding homeomorphism corresponding to such a curve. Corollary 4 of [Pom78] provides us with an example of asymptotically conformal quasicircle C which has an uncountable number of tangent points, with the tangent points dense in C, but they also have zero 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure.
Lemma 7.4. There exists a quasisymmetric g : S1  S1 with asymptotically conformal welding curve C such that Z is not homeomorphic to S2.
Lemma 7.4 follows from Proposition 4.1, Lemma 4.5, and the cited example.
Question 7.5. Is the answer to Question 7.3 yes if we also assume that g : S1  S1 is a quasisymmetry?
To answer Question 7.5 negatively, one needs to construct a quasisymmetry  : Z2  Z2, with g = |S1 , for which the measures gHS11 and HS11 are not mutually singular in any subarc I  S1, yet the corresponding Z is not quasiconformally equivalent to Z. Equivalently, one only needs to show that the homeomorphism H : S2  Z, coinciding with 1 in Z1 and with 2   in Z2, is not quasiconformal. By arguing as in the proof of Lemma 4.8, one sees that H is quasiconformal if and only if H-1  N1,2(Z, S2).
