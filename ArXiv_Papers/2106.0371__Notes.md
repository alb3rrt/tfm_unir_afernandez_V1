## Abstract

Recent advances in deep learning hardware allow large likelihood volumes to be stored directly on the GPU, along with the hardware necessary to efficiently perform GPU-bound 3D convolutions and this obviates many of the disadvantages of grid based methods. In this work, we present a novel CNN-based localisation approach that can leverage modern deep learning hardware. By implementing a grid-based Markov localisation approach directly on the GPU, we create a hybrid CNN that can perform image-based localisation and odometry-based likelihood propagation within a single neural network. The resulting approach is capable of outperforming direct pose regression methods as well as state-of-the-art localisation systems.
