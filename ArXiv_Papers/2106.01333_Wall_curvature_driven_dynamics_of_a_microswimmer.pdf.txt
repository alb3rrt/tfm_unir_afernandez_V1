Microorganisms navigate through fluid, often confined by complex environments, to survive and sustain life. Inspired by this fact, we consider a model system and seek to understand the wall curvature driven dynamics of a squirmer, a mathematical model for a microswimmer, using (i) lattice Boltzmann simulations and (ii) analytical theory by Papavassiliou and Alexander [1]. The instantaneous dynamics of the system is presented in terms of fluid velocity fields, and the translational and angular velocities of the microswimmer, whereas the long time dynamics is presented by plotting the squirmer trajectories near curved boundaries, as well as characterising them in terms of (i) proximity parameter, (ii) retention time, (iii) swimmer orientation and (iv) tangential velocity near the boundary, and (v) scattering angle during the collision. Our detailed analysis shows that irrespective of the type and strength, microswimmers exhibit a greater affinity towards a concave boundary due to hydrodynamic interactions compared to a convex boundary. In the presence of additional repulsive interactions with the boundary, we find that pullers (propel by forward thrust) have a slightly greater affinity towards the convex­curved walls compared to pushers (propel by backward thrust). Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the consequence of hydrodynamic interactions in a unified framework that encompasses the dynamics of pullers, pushers, and neutral swimmers in the neighbourhood of flat, concave, and convex walls. In addition, the combined effect of oppositely curved surfaces is studied by confining the squirmer in an annulus. The results presented in a unified framework and insights obtained are expected to be useful to design geometrical confinements to control and guide the motion of microswimmers in microfluidic applications.

I. INTRODUCTION
The natural habitats of microorganisms are complex. They navigate in a fluid, often through complex and confined environments. In such surroundings, long ranged hydrodynamic interactions of microorganisms with confining boundaries may play a crucial role and they decide the trajectories of these swimming bodies [2]. Therefore important parameters that affect the trajectory of a microorganism, which are studied in the literature, are (i) its size and shape, [3­5], (ii) strength of the confinement [2, 6], (iii) rheological properties of the suspending fluid (viscosity, elasticity etc.) [7­10], (iv) presence of a background flow (linear, quadratic flow etc.) [11, 12], and (v) external forces acting on the microorganism (such as gravity) [13, 14]. On the other hand, far fewer studies have considered the effect of confining geometry on the dynamics of a microswimmer (or a swimming microorganism) and thus a systematic analysis of the effects of curved boundaries on the dynamics of different microswimmers are not well recorded in the literature. In this work, we address this question and fill the gap by presenting a detailed study of the effect of confining geometry on the dynamics of a microswimmer.
Based on geometry, the works that have addressed the effect of confining geometry [1, 15] on the dynamics of a microswimmer can be broadly classified into three categories: effects due to (i) a flat wall [6, 16, 17], (ii) a convex boundary [18­21], and (iii) a concave boundary [22]. Following are some of the interesting behaviours observed in these geometries. Escherichia coli (E. coli ) and other similar bacteria are attracted to flat walls and get trapped. Experiments showed that trapped E. coli rotates in a clockwise direction (when viewed from above the wall) [23­25], but the sense of rotation reverses when it is near a flat fluid-fluid interface [26­28]. Convex boundaries also trap microswimmers, for example chemically propelled Janus microrods are captured by spherical obstacles [20]. The capture occurs only when the size of the obstacle is larger than a critical size [29], and the trapping ability of the spherical obstacle is enhanced by the viscoelasticity of the suspending fluid [15]. Similar trapping ability is exhibited by concave surfaces. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C. reinhardtii ) cells confined in circular and elliptical enclosures get trapped near concave boundaries and this trapping ability is observed to increase with concavity [30] but reduces with increase in activity of the microswimmer and fluid viscoelasticity [15].
The experimental observations are often successfully explained by simple theoretical models and numerical simulations based on the hydrodynamic interactions between the microswimmer and the boundary. For example, a point particle model by Spagnolie et al. [29] qualitatively captured the trapping behavior of microswimmers by spherical obstacles (convex curvature). Building on this concept, both theoretical and numerical investigations have been performed later on, to include finite sized microswimmers and walls with arbitrary curvatures [21, 31]. Desai et al. [32] analyzed spherical, surfactant laden drops and found that the trapping ability of surfactant laden drops is larger than that of rigid spherical obstacles. Recently Sprenger et al. [33] analytically studied the dynamics of a point swimmer confined inside a drop. However, the point particle based theoretical models are valid only if the separation distance between the microswimmer and the boundary is much larger than the size of the microswimmer itself [29, 32­34].
As evident from the above discussion, most of the experimental and theoretical studies have focused the analysis only on a particular type of microswimmer or a particular type of wall curvature (flat, concave or convex). To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that compare and contrast the way in which the concave and convex curvatures affect the microswimmer dynamics and relate the observations to that of a flat wall. Therefore, in this work we analyze the dynamics of various types of microswimmers dictated by different geometrical confinements using the theory developed by Papavassiliou and Alexander [1] and fully resolved numerical simulations based on the lattice Boltzmann method. We present our results in a unified framework illustrating the combined role of microswimmer type and wall curvature in determining the behaviour of microswimmers in confinements. Further, the combined affect of convex and concave curvatures in governing the dynamics of microswimmers are revealed by studying the dynamics of a microswimmer in an annular confinement.
In this work, we restrict the analysis to two dimensions. Such an approach is justified since (i) the motion of the microswimmer is restricted to a plane in most of the experimental studies, (ii) previous studies [35, 36] have shown that the two dimensional models offer physical insights and qualitatively capture the dynamics shown by the three dimensional microswimmers, and (iii) curvature is a second rank tensor and thus the analysis of a three dimensional microswimmer near an arbitrary two dimensional surface is cumbersome due to the large parametric space involved.
This paper is organized as follows. In section II, we give the details of two dimensional squirmer model for the microswimmer, and then present the exact solutions derived by Papavassiliou and Alexander [1] for the squirmer dynamics near a curved boundary. We then outline the algorithm of the lattice Boltzmann numerical scheme for numerical simulations. In section III, we present our results by characterising the dynamics of a microswimmer near convex and concave boundaries. The instantaneous dynamics is characterized in terms of the velocity field of the fluid, and the translational and angular velocities of the microswimmer, whereas the long time dynamics is characterized in terms of defined quantities such as proximity parameter, retention time, average orientation and average tangential velocity of the microswimmer near the boundary, and scattering angle resulting from the wall collision. Then, in section IV, we present the analysis of the microswimmer confined in an annulus in terms of fluid velocity fields and

II. THEORETICAL AND NUMERICAL DETAILS
In this section, we discuss the squirmer model for the microswimmer, the exact expressions for the squirmer dynamics near a curved boundary, and then outline the lattice Boltzmann method for numerical simulations.

A. Squirmer model for the microswimmer

We model the microswimmer as a two dimensional circular squirmer proposed by Blake [37], according to which, ciliary motion on a circular microswimmer is modeled by prescribing a slip velocity (us) on its surface,



us =

An cos(nc)ir + Bn sin(nc)i .

(1)

n=0

Here An and Bn are the strengths of the nth radial and tangential modes respectively, c is the polar angle on the squirmer surface relative to its orientation, and ir and i are the radial and azimuthal unit vectors in the polar coordinate system respectively.
In the far field, each squirmer mode (An, Bn) corresponds to a different fundamental solution of Stokes' equations [34]. For example, the velocity field generated by B1 mode corresponds to a source dipole which decays as 1/r2 (see Fig. 1(a)), and that by B2 mode corresponds to a force dipole (stresslet) which decays as 1/r (see Fig. 1(b)). All other modes produce faster decaying velocity fields that the first two modes remain strongest in the far field [37]. Therefore, we consider only the effect of first two tangential modes in this work, and consider An = 0 for all n and Bn = 0 for n > 2. Usually, the type and strength of the microswimmer is indicated by the non-dimensional number  = B2/B1, which is referred as activity hereafter. The limit   0 corresponds to a squirmer with dominant source dipole mode, and    corresponds to a squirmer with dominant force dipole mode.
Unlike B1 mode, self propulsion cannot be achieved by B2 mode in an unconfined medium or in symmetric environments [6, 38, 39], since the flow field produced by B2 mode has a mirror symmetry. However, in the presence of boundaries, the symmetry in the velocity field is broken which, then, can significantly affect the propulsion velocity of the squirmer.
Based on the far field flows generated, microswimmers are broadly classified into three types [4], namely (i) neutral swimmers such as Janus swimmers [40] and molecular motors [41], pullers such as C. reinhardtii [42, 43], and pushers such as E. coli [44, 45]. A squirmer with only B1 mode (B2 = 0 or  = 0), a positive B2 (or  > 0) and a negative B2 (or  < 0) mimic the flow field generated by neutral swimmers, pullers, and pushers respectively.

FIG. 2. Schematic illustration of the system considered. (a) A squirmer of radius rs is located near a circular post of radius rb at a distance of d = ds + rs + rb, where ds is the shortest distance between the surface of the swimmer and the surface of the boundary. The orientation vector of the squirmer makes an angle s with the separation vector (s^). (b) Change in the curvature  = rs/rb corresponds to different configurations (i)   -, squirmer near an infinitesimally small post, (ii)  = -1, post has the same radius as the squirmer, (iii)  = -0.1, squirmer near a convex boundary, (iv)  = 0, squirmer near a flat wall, (v)  = 0.1, squirmer near a concave boundary, and (vi)  = 0.65, squirmer in a strong circular confinement.

B. Exact solution for squirmer dynamics near a curved boundary

We consider a squirmer of radius rs placed near a circular boundary of radius rb. They are separated by a distance d = ds + rb + rs, where ds is the shortest distance between the surface of the squirmer and the surface of the boundary. The polarity of the squirmer is indicated by the orientation vector that makes an angle s with the separation vector s^ as shown in the Fig. 2(a).
In order to unify the results related to convex, concave, and flat walls, we define a non-dimensional curvature, as the ratio of curvature of the boundary (1/rb) to the curvature of the squirmer (1/rs), i.e.,  = rs/rb with the following sign convention,  < 0 for a convex and  > 0 for a concave boundary. The variation of  with change in the radius of curvature of the neighbouring boundary for a squirmer of fixed size is shown in Fig. 2(b), in the complete range - <  < 1. A squirmer near a circular post of infinitesimally small radius corresponds to   -. Increase in the value of  corresponds to increase in the size of the convex post. At  = -1, the squirmer and the post have the same radius. Further increase in  corresponds to posts of larger size with the limit being  = 0, which corresponds to a flat wall.  > 0 corresponds to a squirmer confined in concave boundaries and the confinement becomes stronger as  increases with the limit being  = 1, when the radius of the confinement is equal to that of the squirmer. Thus, a single parameter  can be used to represent the variation in the curvature of the curved boundary.
Ishimoto and Crowdy [17] solved for the dynamics of a 2D squirmer near a flat wall using the complex variables and the conformal mapping approach in conjunction with the reciprocal theorem. Later Papavassiliou and Alexander [1] extended this analysis for a curved boundary, and derived the following expressions for squirmer dynamics,

Here, V and V are the components of velocity along and perpendicular to the separation vector respectively. z is the angular velocity of the squirmer. (Note that, the expression (Eq. 16) given in [1] has a typo and that is corrected
as per [46].) c1 is a constant, and the variables k1 and k2 are functions of separation distance, radius of the squirmer, and radius of curvature of the boundary as follows:

where, m = d4 + rb4 + rs4 - 2(d2rb2 + d2rs2 + rb2rs2). Here, k1 < 1 and 0  k2  1.

Here, k1  1 and 0  k2  1. In the limit of   0, the above expressions for k1,2 of both convex and concave curvatures reduce to same form,

k1 = 1,

k2

=

+ 2dsrs .

(5)

This is expected as  = 0 corresponds to that of a flat wall, whether approached from the expressions for a concave or convex boundary. It may also be noted that the above limit is same as the solution derived by Ishimoto and Crowdy [17] for a squirmer near a flat wall.
Therefore, the equations of motion of the squirmer near any curved boundary are given by,

ds = V , d = V, and s = z,

(6)

where, the dot on the variable represents the time derivative, and d is the coordinate defined perpendicular to s^. These expressions were integrated using forward Euler method to construct the trajectory of a squirmer in the presence of a curved boundary.
In addition to hydrodynamics, for the purpose of studying the role of repulsive interactions between the microswimmer and the boundary, a hard potential of the form,

V = 0, for ds  rs

(7)

was also implemented on the solid boundary while constructing the squirmer trajectories. In the Eq. 7, rs specifies the distance over which the repulsive potential acts. It may be noted that the hard sphere potential only modifies the component of velocity parallel (V ) to the separation vector (s^) while the perpendicular component and the angular velocity remain unmodified.
Eq. 2 that govern the dynamics of the squirmer were derived by solving Stokes' equations in a complex plane and then using the reciprocal theorem by Papavassiliou and Alexander [1]. They are derived in a context to show that the reciprocal theorem is a powerful mathematical tool to analyze the low Reynolds number hydrodynamics problems. Hence, the equations or their consequences are not analyzed in detail in the literature. Since the above expressions were obtained using reciprocal theorem, the exact flow fields associated with these solutions are not known analytically, which makes it difficult to explain the observations. Therefore, we employ a complementary approach wherein lattice Boltzmann method based numerical simulations are used to construct the flow field generated by the squirmer in the presence of a curved boundary.

C. Numerical method

Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) [47] is a numerical method to solve the fluid flow problems. Unlike the conventional numerical techniques like finite difference, finite volume etc.,[48], where the governing equation is directly discretized and solved, in LBM the Boltzmann equation is discretized [49]. Hence, it is often referred to as a mesoscopic technique. LBM is widely popular to simulate fluid flows containing particles of different shapes [50] and in complex confinements [51]. Below, we give a brief outline of the algorithm, and the method of coupling the squirmer dynamics with the surrounding fluid flow dynamics.
Fluid motion is resolved on a Cartesian mesh by solving the finite difference discretized, BGK approximated Boltzmann equation. Spatial and temporal resolutions are denoted as x and t respectively. The two main steps in the solution procedure are collision and streaming [47, 49], which are given as,

FIG. 3. The curved boundary of the solid particle (continuous black line) is approximated with a stair case construction (dotted line) in the simulations. There are four types of nodes: (i) xp - solid nodes that interact with the fluid nodes (solid black circles), (ii) xf - the fluid nodes that interact with the solid nodes (blue filled circles), (iii) solid nodes that don't interact with the fluid nodes (grey filled circles), and (iv) fluid nodes that don't interact with the solid nodes (hollow circles). Lattice Boltzmann populations moving along the links (brown lines) from xf to xp (or from xp to xf ) are bounced back at boundary nodes xb (green squares).

Here fi(x, t) represents the discrete distribution function in the direction of the lattice velocity vector ei at position x and time t. fi is the post collision discrete distribution function, and fieq is the equilibrium distribution function which is given as,

where wi is the weight factor, cs is the speed of the sound,  is the fluid density, and u is the fluid velocity. Lattice

velocities ei and weight factors wi depend on the particular lattice model used. In this work, we use the D2Q9 model

[52] which has nine velocity directions (i = 0 to 8) at a given lattice point. The relaxation time ( ) in Eq. (8) is

and u = i fiei.

Implementation of boundary conditions - bounce back scheme: In order to impose the boundary conditions

on the surface of the solid (squirmer and the curved boundary) the discrete distribution function streaming in the

direction of the boundary nodes are made to bounce back in the opposite direction with a modification based on the

boundary node velocity [53, 54]. In this work, we use a mid grid bounce back scheme, i.e., boundary nodes (xb) are located half way between the nodes inside the solid surface (xp) and the external fluid nodes (xf ) as shown in Fig. 3.

Then the bounce back scheme can be implemented as,

fi-

where s is the density of the solid particle and ub is the velocity of the boundary node. For the fixed boundary, ub = 0, and for the squirmer,

ub = us + V + z  (xb - xs),

(12)

where V and z are the translational and rotational velocities of the squirmer respectively, and xs is the centre of mass of the squirmer.

Squirmer dynamics: Squirmer motion is governed by the Newton's second law of motion. The total momentum exchange (P) and the total angular momentum exchange (L) between the fluid and the squirmer during one time

P = x3

where the sum runs over all the boundary links pointing from fluid nodes (xf ) to solid nodes (xp). The equations of motion that govern the squirmer dynamics are,

Eq. (15)­(16) are numerically integrated to track the dynamics of the squirmer using a modified implicit scheme.

While an explicit scheme (e.g., forward Euler method) which calculates the velocities at time t using velocities and

forces at time t - t is simpler to implement, it is known to be inaccurate, in particular for small angular velocities.

Therefore, an implicit scheme was necessary to integrate Eq. (15) and (16). However, no such schemes were available

in the literature that could be directly used for an active particle. Hence, we suitably modified the implicit scheme

that was originally proposed for a passive particle in the literature [55] to apply for the squirmer. The details of these

modifications are given in the Appendix A. Using this modified implicit scheme, the time evolution of the position

and the orientation of the squirmer are determined.

Thus, the momentum exchange between the fluid and the squirmer is completely taken into account which ensures

a simultaneous and coupled evolution of the dynamics of the fluid flow and the squirmer.

D. Simulation details

In the simulations, spatial (x) and temporal (t) resolutions are chosen to be unity. The density () and viscosity

(µ) of the fluid are taken as 1 and 1/6 ( = 1) lattice units respectively. In this work, we consider a neutrally

buoyant swimmer (s = ) of size rs = 30 lattice units, and size of the boundary is varied according to rb = rs/ for

the simulations with the concave boundary. Domain size of 20rb × 20rb is used for the simulations with the convex

boundary.

The trajectory of the squirmer near a curved surface is constructed using the algorithm described in the section II B.

However in the results shown below, namely the instantaneous fluid velocity field, and the translational and angular

velocities attained by the squirmer are determined by a simpler, quasi-steady approach [6]. Numerical method has

also been validated by comparing the results with that from the analytical calculations, as shown in Fig. 6. In this

figure, markers in each plot are obtained from the simulations for the case of  = 0.33. A good agreement with the

analytical solution can be observed in all cases, validating the proposed numerical scheme.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, we first discuss the fluid flow around the squirmer when it is located near a wall having either convex or concave curvature. Following this, the instantaneous and then the long term dynamics of the microswimmer in response to the curved boundaries will be discussed. In most of the analysis that follows, the case of B1 and B2 modes are dealt separately to understand the effect of each mode. Since the linear Stokes' equation governs the dynamics of fluid flow which in turn determines the dynamics of the squirmer, the superposition of individual solutions of B1 and B2 modes can be performed to obtain full solution and analyze the effect of activity , as we do in the later sections. A squirmer with only B1 mode and only B2 mode are referred to as a neutral swimmer and a shaker respectively.
A. Fluid dynamics around the squirmer near a curved boundary
The dynamics of a microswimmer in the neighbourhood of a curved wall is governed by four parameters namely, the curvature of the boundary (), the activity (), and its position x, y and orientation (s) with respect to the

FIG. 4. Instantaneous velocity fields of the fluid around the squirmer are obtained from the lattice Boltzmann simulations for s = 45 and ds/rs = 0.5. The first row is for a neutral swimmer (B1 = 0, B2 = 0): (a)  = -0.5, (b)  = -0.2, (c)  = 0, (d)  = 0.2, and (e)  = 0.5. The continuous lines are streamlines, and the background color corresponds to the magnitude of the
normalized velocity field (red - highest, blue - lowest). The second row is for a shaker (B1 = 0, B2 = 0), and for the same  as in first row.

curved boundary. In this section, we analyze the velocity fields generated by the squirmer near the curved boundaries at a given location and orientation but as  varies.
The steady state velocity fields of the fluid generated by a squirmer that is oriented at an angle with respect to the nearby curved boundary, obtained from lattice Boltzmann simulations, are shown in Fig. 4. The first row corresponds to neutral swimmers (B1 = 0, B2 = 0), and the second row corresponds to shakers (B2 = 0). These flow fields are to be contrasted with those in the unbounded fluid domain shown in Fig. 1. For example, B1 mode generates a velocity field corresponding to a source dipole in an unconfined domain (Fig. 1(a)). This field is altered near a convex boundary with streamlines on the source side (in this case) curving and going around the convex object as shown in the Fig. 4(a)­4(b). As size of the convex boundary increases, the streamlines also deflect by a large extent to go around the convex object. In the limit of a flat wall, the streamlines cannot bend around the object any more (Fig. 4(c)). The streamlines bend in the opposite direction as  increases further, aligning with the concave boundary (Fig. 4(d)­4(e)). This change in the streamline patterns (compared to that of an unbounded squirmer) increases viscous dissipation in the system, and therefore, the dissipation can be expected to increase with increase in  for a given value of B1.
Another consequence of the presence of a nearby boundary is the formation of circulations, see for e.g., clockwise circulation ahead of the squirmer next to the convex object in Fig. 4(a) and the clockwise circulation developed on the left side of the squirmer in concave confinement in Fig. 4(d). These circulations are formed far from the squirmer surface. They are generally weak compared to the velocity of the squirmer, so they have less effect on the squirmer dynamics. As the boundary effects become stronger ( increases) these circulations disappear, see for e.g., the clockwise circulation ahead of the squirmer in Fig. 4(a)­4(c) reduces its size as  increases. Similarly, with increase in  in concave confinements, the clockwise circulation on the left side of the squirmer in Fig. 4(d) vanishes and the streamlines are more aligned with the confining boundary as shown in Fig. 4(e). It may also be noted that, for the same ||, the strength of the velocity field is weaker in the case of a concave boundary compared to a convex boundary. This can be expected as the fraction of the boundary to which the microswimmer is exposed increases with increase in  and is maximum in the case of a strong concave confinement (  1). This increased frictional resistance reduces the strength of the fluid velocity field.
We now consider the case of a shaker, a squirmer with only B2 mode, shown in the second row of Fig. 4. The velocity field generated by a B2 mode in an unbounded fluid domain is that of a stresslet, and it is mirror symmetric as shown in Fig. 1(b). However, this symmetry breaks down near a boundary as shown in Fig. 4(f)­4(j). Considering the first case of a smallest convex object (see Fig. 4(f)) it can be noticed that the streamlines curve and go around the convex object similar to the flow generated by the neutral swimmer. However, unlike the neutral swimmer, flow around the shaker on all other sides are also affected. A series of circulations appear around the shaker. The case

9
shown in Fig. 4(f) has two clockwise circulations closer to the squirmer, and one anticlockwise circulation slightly far from the squirmer and on the opposite side of the convex object. It is interesting to note that the occurrence of these circulations themselves (closed streamlines) are in sharp contrast with the open streamlines found in the unconfined case. As the size of the convex object increases, the circulation opposite to the curved boundary gets larger compared to the other two (see Fig. 4(g)). This continues to be the case for a flat wall ( = 0, Fig. 4(h)) and even for weak concave curvatures ( = 0.2, Fig. 4(i)). However in the case of a strong concave confinement ( = 0.5, Fig. 4(j)), another circulation sandwiched between the squirmer and the nearby concave boundary appears and the flow field becomes more symmetric. Thus, the asymmetry in the velocity field varies non-monotonically with the curvature, i.e., asymmetry being minimum both in the limit   - and in the limit   1.
B. Instantaneous dynamics
In this section, we discuss the instantaneous dynamics of the squirmer which is located close to a convex or a concave boundary. The instantaneous translational and angular velocities are analyzed as a function of squirmer orientation and location with respect to the neighbouring solid surface. The translational velocity is reported as its components parallel (V ) and perpendicular (V) to the separation vector pointing from the centre of the squirmer to the surface of the nearest neighbouring boundary (^s).
1. Effect of orientation of the squirmer with respect to the curved boundary
Figure 5 shows the normalized components of instantaneous translational velocity (V and V), and the angular velocity (z) of a squirmer as a function of its orientation (s): Fig. 5(a)­5(c) correspond to a neutral swimmer (B1 = 0, B2 = 0), and Fig. 5(d)­5(f) correspond to a shaker (B1 = 0, B2 = 0). Different curves in each plot are for different values of . It may be observed that, irrespective of the curvature, the magnitude of instantaneous velocities are symmetric about s = 90 (swimmer oriented parallel to the boundary) for both neutral swimmer and shaker. However, the sign (direction of velocity) depends on the squirmer orientation.
Figure 5(a) shows that V of the neutral swimmer continuously decreases with increase in s, reaches a value of zero before increasing further in the opposite direction, i.e., as the squirmer which is oriented towards the boundary (s = 0) turns and orients away from the boundary (s = 180). However, both perpendicular component V and angular velocity z are maximum when the squirmer is orientated parallel to the boundary (s = 90) and they reduce as the neutral swimmer turns in either direction. Similarly, V is maximum for a shaker when it is oriented parallel the boundary (s = 90) and reduces as the swimmer rotates in either direction. In contrast, the perpendicular component and the angular velocity are zero when the shaker is aligned parallel or perpendicular to the boundary but show a maximum at the intermediate angle s = 45. These results remain valid irrespective of the size and nature of curvature of the boundary.
Now lets look into the effect of curvature of the neighbouring boundary on the instantaneous dynamics of the microswimmer. As shown in Fig. 5(a)­5(b) and Fig. 5(d)­5(e), the translational velocity (both V and V) decreases with increase in the curvature. In other words, squirmer has a larger translational velocity near a convex surface compared to a concave surface. As the curvature of the neighbouring boundary changes from a highly convex (  -) to a highly concave (  1) surface, squirmer (specified by a fixed B1 and B2) slows down. This slow down is due to the fact that the larger fraction of the surrounding fluid of the microswimmer is exposed to no-slip boundaries as the curvature of the neighbouring surface changes from convex to concave. The result is that more recirculating regions of the fluid appear as seen in the Fig. 4 and viscous dissipation in the fluid increases. This increase in frictional resistance slows down the microswimmer. The squirmer dynamics near a flat wall ( = 0) is well studied in the literature [6, 17]. Our study shows that, compared to a flat wall ( = 0), a convex surface ( < 0) enhances the translational velocity of the squirmer but a concave surface ( > 0) diminishes it irrespective of the orientation of the squirmer.
However the angular (spin) velocity of the squirmer shows a non-monotonic variation with the change in curvature of the neighbouring boundary. And this variation is also different for B1 and B2 modes. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the angular velocity of a neutral swimmer increases as the curvature of the boundary changes from convex ( < 0) to concave ( > 0) but this trend reverses beyond a critical . When  > 0.276, further increase in  (or concavity of the wall) reduces the angular velocity of the neutral swimmer. This reduction may be due to the fact that, as   1 the squirmer occupies a symmetric position in the concave confinement. Thus, compared to a flat wall, both concave and convex boundaries reduce the angular velocity of the neutral swimmer except when for weak concave curvatures, namely 0 <  < 0.276 when the angular velocity is increased. Two features that are worth noticing are that: (i) the boundary induced angular velocity always rotates the neutral swimmer away from the boundary, (ii) the

(a) V , (b) V (the components of instantaneous translational velocity parallel and perpendicular to the separation vector), and (c) z (the angular velocity) of a neutral swimmer (B1 = 0, B2 = 0) are plotted as a function of squirmer orientation. (d)-(f) are similar plots for a shaker (B1 = 0, B2 = 0). In all cases, the surface to surface separation is maintained as ds = 0.2rs. Legends of all plots are same as that given in (a). V and V are normalized by the U0, and z is normalized by rsU0, where U0 = B1/2 for top row and B2/2 for bottom row.

angular velocity of the squirmer does not go to zero as   -, i.e., in the limit of a point convex object because the point object generates a Stokeslet disturbance velocity field, thus rotating the squirmer even in the limiting case of   -.
A shaker shows a more subtle behaviour in terms of its angular velocity. As  increases from that corresponding to a convex curvature to that of a concave curvature, the magnitude of the angular velocity decreases. It becomes zero at  = 0.206, a weak concave curvature. Further increase in the concavity of the wall increases the angular velocity of the shaker in the opposite direction, but this behaviour again breaks down beyond a critical . When  > 0.573, further increase in the concavity of the boundary reduces the angular velocity of the shaker. This reduction is similar to that of a neutral swimmer where it attains a symmetric position in strong confinements and slows down significantly. Unlike neutral swimmer, the boundary induced direction of rotation of the shaker depends on both  and the orientation of the squirmer. Near a convex object, a shaker oriented towards the boundary rotates further towards it but one rotated away from the boundary rotates further away from it. Interpreting the results in another way - compared to that near a flat plate, a shaker near a convex object rotates faster, and near a concave object rotates slower. Moreover, concavity of the boundary may also change the direction of rotation of the shaker compared to that near a flat wall. The change in the sign of the angular velocity is due to the non-monotonic variation of asymmetry in the velocity field with the curvature (refer Fig. 4(f)­4(d)).
The instantaneous dynamics of a microswimmer can be calculated by a scaled sum of the two solutions (that of B1 and B2 modes) discussed above, and clearly, this behaviour can be complicated based on the individual contributions from each mode.

The markers in each plot are obtained from lattice Boltzmann simulations for the case of  = 0.33.

2. Effect of location of the squirmer with respect to the curved boundary
In the subsection (III B 1), we analyzed the effect of orientation on the instantaneous dynamics of the squirmer for a constant separation distance. Here, we analyze the effect of separation distance (ds) on the squirmer dynamics when it is in the neighbourhood of a curved boundary.
The instantaneous velocities V , V, and z as a function of separation distance between the surface of the squirmer and the curved boundary (ds) are shown in the Fig. 6. The minimum separation distance ds = 0 corresponds to a physical contact between the squirmer and the boundary. For a concave boundary, the maximum separation distance is ds = rb - rs, which corresponds to a squirmer located at the center of the circular confinement. There is no such maximum ds for a convex boundary. As earlier, the analysis for B1 and B2 modes are done separately: Fig. 6(a)­6(c) correspond to a neutral swimmer, and Fig. 6(d)­6(f) correspond to a shaker. In all cases, at ds = 0 the translational velocities vanish while angular velocities exhibit a maximum value.
Let us consider the case of a neutral swimmer first, shown in Fig. 6(a)­6(b). As ds increases both V and V increase irrespective of whether it is near a convex or a concave boundary. However, for a given ds both V and V decrease with increase in . In other words, the translational velocity of a neutral swimmer is smaller near a concave boundary compared to a convex boundary. This difference between convex and concave boundaries increases with increase in ds. For large ds, the translational velocity approaches that of a squirmer in the unbounded domain when it is located in the neighbourhood of a convex boundary, but it approaches that of a concentrically placed squirmer in a circular confinement exhibiting a smaller translational velocity when it is in the neighbourhood of a concave boundary. As shown in Fig. 6(c), the angular velocity of the squirmer decreases monotonically with separation distance. However the variation of angular velocity with  is non monotonic at a given ds. The angular velocity of the squirmer slightly

repulsive potential.

increases with increase in  (compare a convex wall with a flat wall), but as   1 (strongly concave boundary), it decreases again as squirmer occupies a symmetric position in the strong confinement.
Unlike that of a neutral swimmer, the induced velocities on the shaker is a non-monotonic function of ds. At ds = 0, both V and V are zero since the squirmer is in contact with the boundary. On the other hand, at large ds, a squirmer located near a convex boundary approaches the dynamics of an unconfined shaker which will have V = 0 and V = 0. Similarly a squirmer in the neighbourhood of a concave surface, when ds is large, corresponds to a concentric squirmer in circular confinement with a symmetric flow field around it and therefore, V = 0 and V = 0. Thus, the translational velocity of a shaker is zero in either limit (small and large ds) and it exhibits a maximum velocity for some intermediate values of ds as shown in Fig. 6(d)­6(e). Similar to B1 mode, at a fixed value of ds the components of induced velocity V and V also decrease with increase in . It may be noted that, as shown in Fig. 6(f) the variation in the angular velocity of a shaker is different from its translational counterpart: z is maximum when ds = 0 and it decreases to zero as ds increases. This trend itself is not monotonic. For a squirmer located near a convex wall the angular velocity decreases as ds increases, changes sign, reaches a maximum value before reducing further to reach zero. On the other hand, for a squirmer in the neighbourhood of a concave surface the reduction in angular velocity with ds is monotonic. Despite this complex behaviour the following two points may be noticed in Fig. 6(f): (i) when ds is large, at a given ds the induced angular velocity is larger due to a neighbouring convex boundary than a concave boundary, and (ii) when ds  0 the trend reverses, and at a given ds the angular velocity due to a neighbouring concave boundary is more than that due to a convex boundary.
To summarise this section, for a given ds the translational velocity of both neutral swimmer and shaker are always largest due to a convex boundary and smallest due to a concave boundary, and the case of a flat wall lies in between. Thus, microswimmers have larger velocity near convex boundaries compared to concave boundaries. The signs of V and V depend upon the orientation of the squirmer and the sign of B2 mode. No such general statements can be made with regard to the variations of angular velocity as its dependence on ds and  is more complex. This diversity in the variation of instantaneous velocities (V , V, and z) makes it difficult to predict the long time behavior of a microswimmer near a curved boundary. Therefore we now calculate the trajectory of a squirmer near curved boundaries.

13
C. Long time dynamics
The analysis on the instantaneous dynamics in the subsection III B showed that the dynamics of the microswimmer depends upon (i) its location and orientation with respect to the curved boundary, (ii) the size and nature of curvature of the boundary, and (iii) the strength and nature of the squirmer. In order to comprehensively understand the resulting dynamics due to these multiple factors and competing effects we now follow the squirmers over longer times as they come in contact with a curved surface, construct their trajectories, and analyze and quantify these trajectories using different measures.

1. Trajectory of a squirmer near the curved boundary
Figure 7 illustrates the typical trajectories of a squirmer when initialised at ds = rs near a curved wall. In all cases the trajectories are colored by 90 - s, the instantaneous angle that the squirmer makes with the tangent drawn on the boundary surface. Figure 7(a) shows that a neutral swimmer bounces off from the convex object after the hydrodynamic collision. On the other hand, a shaker which bounces off from the convex surface is attracted towards the surface again and thus exhibiting an oscillatory trajectory on the convex object as shown in Fig. 7(b). Similar bouncing and oscillatory trajectories are shown by neutral swimmers (Fig. 7(c)) and shakers (Fig. 7(d)) on concave surfaces. Papavassiliou and Alexander [1] have reported similar trajectories for a squirmer in a concave confinement.
The presence of a repulsive potential on the boundary surface (Eq. 7) restricts the distance of closest approach of the squirmer. Therefore, the trajectory of the squirmer is affected by the repulsive potential of the curved walls, as has been demonstrated earlier for flat walls [56]. The altered trajectories corresponding to four different situations described above, due to the repulsive potential of the curved surface, are shown in Fig. 7(e)­7(h). It may be noticed that the presence of a repulsive potential does not change the qualitative nature of the trajectories in these four cases, and both bouncing off and oscillatory trajectories are seen. However, the amplitude of the oscillations are smaller in case of the repulsive boundary, which arises from the restricted motion of the squirmer near the surface. In some cases, the oscillations may completely disappear and consequently the squirmer crawls on the curved surface, as shown in Fig. 7(h).
Thus, in general the observed trajectories of a microswimmer near a curved surface may be classified into three categories (i) bouncing, (ii) oscillatory, and (iii) crawling.

2. Characterising the trajectories - proximity parameter and retention time

In order to classify different kinds of trajectories, and thus to quantify the effect of wall curvature on the behaviour of microswimmers we define two measures: proximity parameter and retention time.
Proximity parameter quantifies the affinity of the microswimmer towards the boundary based on its trajectory. It is defined as the fraction of the distance that a microswimmer traverses in close proximity of a curved boundary,

 = ds<dc dS , dS

(17)

where dS is the differential arc length on the trajectory of the microswimmer, and dc is a cut off distance. If a squirmer bounces off from the boundary and swims away after the hydrodynamic collision (e.g., Fig. 7(a), 7(c)), then   0, i.e., the distance travelled by the squirmer in proximity of the boundary is much smaller than the total distance that it travelled. In the other limit,   1 corresponds to a crawling behavior of the squirmer where the squirmer is always in close proximity of the boundary (e.g., Fig. 7(h)). Intermediate values of  represent oscillatory trajectories of varying amplitude and frequency ( as in Fig. 7(b) and Fig. 7(d)), with increase in  indicating more frequent oscillations with decreasing amplitude and the squirmer trajectory lying more in close proximity of the surface.
Since velocity of the microswimmer is not constant along its path, it is also useful to quantify the time spent by the microswimmer in proximity of a surface, as it gives an independent measure of the affinity of the microswimmer towards the surface. Thus, a parameter, retention time is defined as,

tr =

ds<dc dt , dt

(18)

where dt is the differential time taken by the microswimmer on its trajectory. For a bouncing trajectory tr  0, for a crawling behavior tr  1, and intermediate values of tr indicates oscillatory trajectories, similar to the proximity parameter.

(c) The contour plot of average retention time, tr , as a function of the curvature () and , and in the absence of repulsion ( = 0). Colorbar of (a) and (b) is same as that of (c). For the analysis, we approximate the integral in Eq. 19­20 with summation, and divide the orientational space into 18 equal size intervals.

As discussed earlier, the trajectory and hence both  and tr are initial condition dependent. Therefore, we integrate  and tr over all possible initial orientations to define an average proximity parameter,

which eliminate the dependency of  and tr on the initial orientation of the squirmer si .

Average proximity parameter: Figure 8(a) depicts the dependency of average proximity parameter on the curvature  and the activity . It may be observed that  0.2, in the  -  plane as long as  < 0. This small value of  indicates minimal contact between the squirmer and convex surfaces it comes into contact with. The corresponding trajectories may be either single contact (bouncing) or multiple contact (oscillatory). Bouncing trajectories are encountered in two regions in  -  plane: (i) by squirmers with dominant B1 mode (  0: neutral swimmers, weak pullers and pushers) irrespective of the value of the curvature as long as  < 0, and (ii) squirmers with dominant B2 mode(|| 4: strong pullers and pushers) on strongly curved convex surfaces ( -0.5). On contrary, when both B1 and B2 modes are significant (|| < 4: pullers and pushers), such squirmers show small to moderate values of  on convex surfaces indicate that they get trapped and exhibit wall bounded oscillations. It may also be noted that the average proximity parameter increases with increase in , irrespective of the value of . This increase is least for the squirmers with dominant B1 mode (  0), so they continue to exhibit bouncing trajectory even on the flat wall. All other swimmers, (|| > 1) exhibit oscillatory trajectory on a flat wall as reported in [17]. The increase in  with increase in  continues even beyond the wall limit ( > 0), i.e., as the concavity of the confinement increases. Moreover, when  > 0, the average proximity parameter is dependent only on  when || is approximately less than unity.
In other words, Fig. 8(a) suggests that a microswimmer is likely to be attracted towards a concave boundary and swims close to it. The proximity of the trajectory to the surface increases with increase in concavity, irrespective of the type and strength of the microswimmer. Thus, hydrodynamic interaction results in a squirmer to swim away from a convex boundary but to swim closer to a concave boundary. A flat plate has   0.4, an intermediate behaviour representing neither a strong attraction nor a strong repulsion.
The increase in proximity parameter with curvature i.e., as the curvature changes from convex to concave can be understood as follows. Firstly, it may be noted that Fig. 5­6 show that the instantaneous translational velocities

15
decrease with increase in . Moreover, the angular velocity of the squirmer near a convex boundary is generally larger than that near a concave boundary (except a neutral swimmer near a weak concave surface). Therefore, a microswimmer located near a convex boundary can reorient easily, resulting in an escape from the neighbouring wall. On the other hand the microswimmer near a concave boundary will exhibit a weaker dynamics. Secondly, the geometry of the neighbouring wall makes a difference - an escaped microswimmer goes further away from the neighbouring part of the surface when escaping from a convex boundary, but this will not be the case with a concave boundary. An escaping microswimmer may get again influenced by the neighbouring wall due to the concavity of the surface. Thus, a microswimmer near a convex boundary easily escapes while a microswimmer near a concave boundary continues to stay close to it.
As mentioned earlier,  is independent of  for sufficiently large ||. This may be expected as large || indicates that the squirmer dynamics is primarily governed by B2 mode, and contributions from B1 mode is smaller. On the other hand when || < 1 neither B1 nor B2 contributions can be neglected. As ||  0 squirmer behaviour is dictated only by B1 mode. For these swimmers, if   0, but  > 0 (weak concave curvature) the angular velocity of a squirmer is sufficiently large that it easily escapes from the surface and thus,  remains small. However, on these weakly concave surfaces, as || increases there will be a transition from bouncing to oscillatory trajectory. This observation is similar to the behavior of two dimensional squirmers observed near a flat wall [6]. In the limit   1, the squirmer motion is highly restricted, and the angular velocities are small. Hence, in this limit, irrespective of  the proximity parameter is close to 1 indicating a crawling behavior.
Another characteristic feature to note in Fig. 8(a) is the symmetry about  = 0 axis. This happens because a puller will show exactly the same trajectory as a pusher when initialised at the same location but at a different orientation. Therefore, integrating over the initial orientations, average proximity parameter doesn't distinguish pullers and pushers which leads to the symmetry about  = 0 axis. However, this is not the case when the wall has a repulsive force. This case is illustrated in Fig. 8(b) where the average proximity parameter is plotted in  -  phase space. The symmetry about  = 0 axis is slightly broken. In the case of a strong convex boundary, pullers ( > 0) have slightly larger proximity parameter compared to pushers ( < 0) however both pullers and pushers have either a bouncing or an oscillatory trajectory. As the curvature changes from convex to concave, irrespective of  the proximity parameter increases. The small asymmetry, namely pullers have slightly larger proximity parameter compared to equally strong pushers holds for weak concave and convex surfaces as well. As the concave confinement becomes stronger, irrespective of  the proximity parameter is very large indicating a crawling trajectory.
More importantly, on comparing Fig. 8(a) and Fig. 8(b) it can be noted that the presence of repulsion increases the proximity parameter irrespective of  and . Thus, the affinity of the microswimmer towards the boundary increases with presence of repulsive forces on the wall. For example, the region of  -  plane corresponding to bouncing trajectories exhibited by strong pushers and pullers shrinks. Similarly, the increase in affinity is quite significant for concave surfaces suggesting that the proximity of the squirmer trajectory near a concave surface is enhanced by the repulsive forces on the boundary, which occurs irrespective of the value of . However, the enhancement due to repulsive force is not significant for neutral swimmers, and when  < 0, they continue to exhibit bouncing trajectories.
Average retention time: Now, we analyse the effect of  and  on average retention time tr . This is illustrated in Fig. 8(c). Clearly, the dependency of retention time on  and  is very similar to that of proximity parameter. For a fixed , the retention time increases with increase in , i.e., as curvature changes from convex to concave, indicating a transition from bouncing to crawling trajectory. Similar to  , the retention time is insensitive to  unless || is small. The symmetry about  = 0 axis is also noticeable and this symmetry breaks down when the curved surface exhibits a repulsive potential. In other words, tr follows the same trend as  suggesting that (i) the nature of the behaviour of the microswimmer near a curved boundary can be inferred from either of these measures, and (ii) the conclusions drawn from Fig. 8(a)­8(b) are robust.
3. Characterizing the dynamics close to the boundary - Squirmer orientation, tangential velocity, and scattering angle
In the subsection III C 2 we characterised the entire trajectory of a squirmer in terms of average proximity parameter and average retention time. Now we analyze the configurational and dynamic behaviour of the squirmer when it is in the neighbourhood of the curved boundaries.
Squirmer orientation near the boundary: As the squirmer moves along the wall, its orientation changes continuously. We measured the angle that the squirmer makes with the neighbouring surface, i.e., measured as the angle between the squirmer orientation and the surface tangent, and averaged over the trajectory when the squirmer is in proximity to the boundary, ds  dc. Figure 9(a) illustrates that the squirmer maintains an angle close to  53 with the neighbouring surface, irrespective of the curvature of the surface  or the activity . However, a considerable

Data in (c) is obtained by choosing the initial orientation of the squirmer to be si = 10. The inset in (c) shows the definition of the scattering angle S.

change in the value is observed if the curved boundary possesses repulsive forces. It has been found that, in this case the squirmer is more aligned with the boundary irrespective of  or . However, Das and Cacciuto [31] reported a microswimmer dependent alignment on curved boundaries, which may be due to the fact that the rotational dynamics of the microswimmers in their study was affected by the thermal fluctuations.
Tangential velocity near the boundary: The average velocity parallel to the boundary V is calculated when the squirmer is in the proximity of the surface (d  dc) and is shown in Fig. 9(b) as a function of  and . It may be noted that the average tangential velocity of the squirmer near a convex curvature is larger compared to that near a concave curvature. This is in agreement with our previous observations in (Fig. 5(b), 5(e)), where it was found that the instantaneous translational velocity decreases as the curvature changes from convex to concave. A larger tangential velocity near a convex surface indicates an easy escape of the squirmer while a smaller tangential velocity near a concave surface indicates the trapping ability of the surface. Again, these observations are consistent with our earlier findings on proximity parameter and retention time, both of which are seen to increase as the curvature changes from convex to concave.
However it is worth noting that, irrespective of the curvature the average tangential velocity of pushers is larger than pullers when  < 0 (convex walls). This arises from the fact that instantaneous tangential velocities due to +B1 and +B2 modes are in opposite directions (Fig. 5(b), 5(e)). Hence, for a given , the instantaneous tangential velocity of pullers (B1 > 0, B2 > 0) is smaller compared to pushers (B1 > 0, B2 < 0). Since smaller tangential velocity indicates lesser possibility of escaping of the microswimmer from the neighbourhood of a convex surface, we may conclude that pullers have more affinity towards convex surfaces compared to pushers. Figure 9(b) shows that V is almost insensitive to  near concave surfaces.
Scattering angle: Here, we analyze the angle at which the squirmer scatters after its collision with the curved surface. Scattering angle (S) is defined as the angle between the incident trajectory and the reflected trajectory as shown in the inset of Fig. 9(c).
In Fig. 9(c), the scattering angle is plotted as a function of  for various  for a particular initial position and orientation. There is a systematic reduction in the scattering angle as the curvature changes from convex to concave surfaces, and can be understood as follows. When   -, the squirmer dynamics is less affected by the presence of boundary, it adopts a trajectory with only a small deviation from its original straight line path and thus the resulting scattering angle is high. As  increases, the boundary induced angular velocity reorients the swimmer more resulting in escape from the nearby boundary. This deflection from the original path increases with increase in  and consequently the scattering angle decreases with the curvature. In short, the microswimmers deflects with larger scattering angles from convex surfaces, and with smaller scattering angles from concave surfaces. The variation of scattering angle with  is rather small and complex, and it is found that the scattering angle also depends strongly on the initial location and orientation of the squirmer.
Till now, we analyzed the affinity of the microswimmer towards a convex or a concave boundary by calculating various measures namely proximity parameter, retention time, squirmer orientation near the boundary, tangential

velocity near the boundary, and scattering angle. All the analysis shows that, a convex surface is less likely to trap the microswimmer hydrodynamically while a concave surface does. The type and strength of the microswimmer does not seem to be very important in determining this behavior: compared to pushers, pullers show only a slightly greater affinity towards the convex surfaces. It has also been seen that repulsive forces on the surface enhance the affinity of the microswimmer towards the boundary. The extent of enhancement in the affinity can be significant for a concave surface.
We now investigate the combined effects of concave and convex curvatures by analyzing the squirmer dynamics in an annular confinement.

IV. SQUIRMER DYNAMICS IN AN ANNULAR CONFINEMENT - NET EFFECT OF BOTH CONVEX AND CONCAVE CURVATURES

In earlier sections, we have analyzed the squirmer dynamics near a concave or a convex boundary. However, most often the boundaries are geometrically complex. Therefore, here we analyze the squirmer dynamics in annular confinement, where the dynamics is governed by both convex and concave curvatures of the boundary. A convex post is placed concentrically within a concave confinement, where both the convex post and the concave confinement are circular, and the motion of the squirmer in the resulting annular space is analyzed in this section.
The non-dimensional radii of curvature of the inner convex post, i = rs/rib and the outer concave confinement o = rs/rob are taken to be negative and positive respectively to be consistent with the notation in the earlier sections. Further, in order to characterise the separation distance between the squirmer and the surrounding surfaces, we define eccentricity

dn

=

rob

dsi - rib - 2rs

(21)

where dsi is the shortest distance between the surface of the inner convex post and the surface of the squirmer. dn = 0 corresponds to the squirmer touching the inner convex post, and dn = 1 corresponds to the squirmer touching the outer concave confinement.
As earlier, two different approaches are used to analyze the squirmer dynamics:

1. In the section III, exact expressions describing the squirmer motion near a curved boundary [1] is used for the analysis. However, the exact expressions that govern the squirmer dynamics in an annular confinement is not available. Therefore, in this first approach, we construct an approximate solution by superposition:

Vannular = Vconvex + Vconcave, annular = convex + concave,

(22) (23)

where Vconvex, Vconcave, convex, and concave are obtained from Eq. 2. Such approximate analysis based on superposition is shown to be useful in the context of a microswimmer confined between two flat walls [12]. To

avoid the penetration of the squirmer into the boundary while constructing trajectories, a hard repulsion at a distance rs is imposed from the confining surfaces.
2. In the second approach, no such assumptions are made, instead full numerical simulations are performed for a squirmer in an annular confinement using LBM simulations as explained in section II C.
A comparison between two approaches, namely the instantaneous velocities obtained from the approximate expressions (first approach) and the exact values obtained from the LBM simulations (second approach) is given in Appendix B.
Figure 10 shows the steady state velocity fields generated by the squirmer in an annular confinement for varying eccentricities (dn). These velocity fields are qualitatively similar to that observed near individual concave and convex boundaries. As shown in Fig. 10(a), when the neutral swimmer (B1 = 0, B2 = 0) is close to the inner convex post (dn  0), the source sink nature of the flow is majorly affected, but no secondary circulations are observed. On the other hand the same swimmer, when close to the concave boundary (dn  1) shows secondary circulations (Fig. 10(c)). However the convex post obstructs these secondary circulations and thus they may appear differently compared to the case without the post (as in section III A). Similarly, as shown in Fig. 10(b)­10(d), the flow field generated by a shaker (B1 = 0, B2 = 0) in annular confinement is similar to that observed near convex and concave boundary. Again, if the squirmer is located close to a concave surface, then we can observe that the inner convex post alters the streamlines compared to the case where there is no post. The close similarity in the flow fields generated by the squirmer in the annular confinement and in the presence of individual surfaces show that the squirmer behaviour is likely to be governed solely by the nature of nearby surface in most cases, which we verify below by constructing its trajectories.
Figure 11 describes the trajectories of the squirmer in an annular confinement. For a neutral swimmer, the effect of size of the convex post i, the effect of initial orientation, and the effect of initial location are shown in Fig. 11(a), Fig. 11(b), and Fig. 11(c) respectively. Similar plots for a shaker are shown in Fig. 11(d), Fig. 11(e), and Fig. 11(f).

19
It may be noticed from Fig. 11(a)­11(c) that, irrespective of the value of i, initial orientation and location, a neutral swimmer bounces off from the outer concave confinement. The collision with concave surface occurs multiple times thus the squirmer exhibits a bouncing trajectory on the outer concave surface, but during its path it never comes in contact with the convex post. Similar behaviour is observed even by varying o (not shown). It is interesting to note that even in cases when the squirmer is initially oriented towards the inner convex surface (Fig. 11(b)), the squirmer is eventually attracted to the concave surface after the initial hydrodynamic collision with the convex surface. On the other hand as shown in Fig. 11(d)­11(f), a shaker is attracted towards the inner convex surface irrespective of the size of the convex post, initial orientation or location. If the size of the convex post is small, then the trajectory is asymmetric about the post (Fig. 11(d)). As i decreases, the size of the squirmer becomes comparable with the available annular space then the squirmer exhibits concentric but oscillatory trajectory. The exception to these observations is when the shaker is initially located very close to the outer concave surface. In this case, the squirmer remains in the attractive zone of the concave surface and exhibits an oscillatory trajectory on the concave surface (Fig. 11(f)).
These observations are commensurate with earlier discussions and can be understood as follows. Proximity parameter (Fig. 8) shows that the affinity of the neutral swimmer increases with increase in , i.e., neutral swimmer has higher affinity towards a concave surface compared to a convex surface of same radius. Therefore, it is not surprising to see that the concave surface attracts the neutral swimmer which then exhibits a bouncing trajectory on the outer concave confinement in the annulus, similar to the neutral swimmer confined in a concave confinement without the inner post (Fig. 7(c), 7(g)). It may also be noted that the angular velocity of a neutral swimmer near a convex surface is larger than that near a concave surface. The result is that, the squirmers bounce from the convex surface with a large scattering angle even when they are initially directed towards it and then they approach the concave confinement.
The scattering at the outer concave surface is not sufficiently strong to make them move towards the convex surface back and the neutral swimmers exhibit a bouncing trajectory along the outer concave surface.
However, for a shaker both inner convex and outer concave surfaces act as attractors. In other words, a shaker has almost equal affinity towards the strong convex and weak concave surfaces (Fig. 7(b)­7(d)). Therefore, shaker exhibits an initial condition dependent trajectory. If the shaker is located close to the inner convex surface, it gets trapped on the inner convex surface. However, the attraction by the confining concave surface results in periodic drifts from the convex surface and thus the squirmer shows an asymmetric trajectory around the convex post. If the shaker is initialised away from the inner surface, the affinity towards the inner convex surface decreases while affinity towards the outer concave surface increases. Beyond a certain distance, the effect of outer concave curvature dominates and shaker gets trapped by the outer concave surface.
V. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
This work analysed the dynamics of a microswimmer (modelled using squirmer model) in the neighbourhood of a curved wall in two dimensions. The squirmer trajectories are constructed based on the results by Papavassiliou and Alexander [1], and the corresponding flow fields are obtained from simulations using lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). An implicit scheme to update the squirmer dynamics is proposed in conjunction with LBM, and a close match between analytical and numerical solutions is found. Squirmer dynamics inside and outside a circular boundary are analyzed to understand the effect of concavity and convexity of the walls individually and to compare with the squirmer behaviour near a flat wall. Finally, we analyzed the squirmer dynamics in an annular confinement to understand the combined effect of convex and concave curvatures.
It was found that a microswimmer exhibits three kinds of trajectories near a curved boundary: (i) bouncing, (ii) oscillatory, and (iii) crawling trajectories. This is consistent with the observations near a convex post reported in the experiments of Takagi et al. [20], and in the simulations of M. Kuron et al. (refer Fig. 4 in [21]). The trajectory of a squirmer has been found to be sensitive to its initial location and orientation. Hence, we analyzed the squirmer dynamics by introducing new measures, namely average proximity parameter (  ) and average retention time ( tr ) which are obtained by averaging  and tr respectively over all possible initial orientations. The proximity parameter and the retention time respectively measure the average distance and time that the microswimmer spends in the neighbourhood of a wall.
We found that the proximity parameter  increases with the wall curvature  indicating a direct correlation between the two. Therefore microswimmers, irrespective of their type and strength (characterised by activity ), have a greater affinity towards a concave boundary compared to a convex boundary. Our findings are consistent with earlier observations - (i) Ostapenko et al. [30] reported that the probability of finding a C. reinhardtii in an elliptical confinement increases with increase in the local curvature of the boundary, and (ii) Kuron et al. [21] reported that the affinity of a microswimmer towards a convex boundary increases with increase in the curvature . It has been found

20
that the presence of repulsive forces on the curved walls enhances the affinity of the microswimmer towards them. It happens irrespective of  and , and in such cases, pullers have a slightly more affinity towards the convex and weak concave walls compared to pushers. In stronger concave confinements, squirmer dynamics is found to be independent of activity . The higher affinity of pullers towards a convex surface is also consistent with the observations of Kuron et al. [21] made using their 3D simulations. As the velocity of the squirmer is not constant along its path, the affinity of the squirmer towards a curved surface is also quantified in terms of retention time. We observed that the dependence of average retention time on  and  is similar to that of the proximity parameter.
The near wall behavior of a squirmer is characterized in terms of its orientation with the surface tangent and its tangential velocity. The squirmer was found to maintain an angle close to 53 with the neighbouring surface, irrespective of  and . On the other hand, the tangential velocity in proximity of a curved surface is observed to decrease with increase in , i.e., it is larger near a convex curvature compared to a concave curvature. Larger tangential velocity near a convex surface indicates an easy escape of the squirmer while that near a concave surface can lead to further trapping of the squirmer. It has been found that irrespective of the curvature, the average tangential velocity of pushers is found to be slightly larger than pullers near convex and weak concave walls. This last observation is consistent with the study by Das and Cacciuto [31], which included the role of thermal fluctuations as well.
The non-trapping dynamics of a squirmer is characterized in terms of scattering angle while bouncing off from the curved surface. The scattering angle was observed to decrease with increase in , i.e., as the curvature changes from convex to concave. The larger values of scattering angle in the presence of a convex curvature is due to the undeflected trajectories of the microswimmer, that resulted from the weaker hydrodynamic interaction between the microswimmer and the convex boundary.
The combined effects of convex and concave curvatures on microswimmer dynamics was analysed by placing the squirmer in a concentric annular confinement. Compared to that of an unconfined squirmer, the velocity field due to a confined squirmer is different which includes loss of symmetry of the flow field around the squirmer and the generation of secondary circulations. With increase in eccentricity, i.e., as squirmer gets closer to the outer concave confinement, such deviations increase indicating a large viscous dissipation and correspondingly a smaller swimming velocity. This difference in the flow fields and the squirmer dynamics due to disturbance generated by a convex and a concave boundary are also evident when a microswimmer in the neighbourhood of a single curved wall is analyzed. The exact expressions that govern the squirmer dynamics in an annular confinement are not available, hence we constructed approximate equations by superposition of induced velocities due to convex and concave curvatures. Extending the approximate solution approach to complex geometries like porous media [57] have to be the subject of future investigations. The instantaneous velocities obtained from the approximate expressions are in good agreement with those obtained from lattice Boltzmann simulations for a neutral swimmer. The agreement is weaker for a shaker, possibly due to the slower decay of its velocity field. On analyzing the trajectories, it was found that a neutral swimmer exhibits a bouncing trajectory along the outer confinement. It occurs even if the squirmer is initially oriented towards the inner convex post because it collides with the post and scatters towards the outer concave boundary. However, the trajectory of a shaker is found to depend on the initial location. If shaker is initialized near the inner convex surface, it gets trapped on it, which happens only beyond a critical radius of the inner convex surface. If squirmer is initialized close to the outer concave surface, it gets trapped on it, irrespective of its radius of curvature.
Finally we note that the analysis presented here may provide guidelines in designing geometrical confinements that can be used to drive the motion of a microswimmer and thus to control its trajectory. Moreover, different measures introduced in the work can be used in a variety of contexts: (i) if it is desirable to trap a microswimmer for a particular application, results from the proximity parameter can be used since it provides information about the curvature of the boundary required to trap the microswimmer of particular type (given ). (ii) The retention time can be correlated with the time required to clean a curved surface to prevent the bio-fouling since retention time provides the average residence time of the microswimmer in proximity of the surfaces. (iii) The observations of the scattering angle may be used to guide the trajectory of a microswimmer by varying the local curvature of the boundary with which it interacts. However, caution must be exercised in quantitative comparisons as the calculations presented here are strictly in two dimensions. Our results are qualitatively consistent with several experiments and numerical simulations reported in the literature, but future investigations must be carried out in three dimensions to approach experimental conditions, and to make quantitative predictions. Similarly relaxing the assumption of circular or spherical shape of the squirmer may also be important. Such investigations will also help us to determine the relative importance of hydrodynamics in the collision process of a microswimmer with a curved wall more accurately.
APPENDIX A
Implicit scheme for updating linear and angular velocities of the squirmer: In this appendix, we extend the implicit scheme proposed for a passive particle by Lowe et al. [55], to an active particle, squirmer with first

21

two tangential modes to update the translational and angular velocities in the numerical scheme based on lattice

Boltzmann method. It is straight forward to extend present scheme to higher order squirmer modes.

The idea of implicit scheme is to use the particle velocity at the new time step to calculate the boundary velocity

of the particle given by Eq. 12, rather than using the velocity in the previous time step. We summarise the steps

involved in this process. First, the net momentum exchange between the particle and the fluid is calculated for the

implemented boundary conditions (bounce back scheme [49]). This result is then used to derive the expressions for

force and torque acting on a squirmer of mass, M , and moment of inertia, I. Both force and torque will be functions

of two unknown velocity components (in the x and y directions) namely Vx and Vy, and the unknown angular velocity

of the particle in the z-direction z. Newton's second law is used here to relate the forces and torques acting on

the squirmer to the rate of change of linear and angular momentum. Thus, finally, a set of three linear equations

 a11 a12 a13   Vx   b1   c1 

are obtained,  a21 a22 a23   Vy  =  b2 + c2 , which has to be solved simultaneously to determine the

where  is the polar angle. In the above expressions, r is the position vector of a point relative to the squirmer centre, and Vx(t), Vy(t), and z(t) are the known values at the present time t. The summation is to be carried out over each boundary node (xb) and over all relevant directions (ei). The proposed scheme can be extended easily to any number of squirmers as well.
APPENDIX B
In this appendix, the instantaneous velocities of a squirmer in annular confinement obtained from the approximate expressions, Eq. 22, 23 are compared with the values obtained from full numerical, lattice Boltzmann simulations.

FIG. 12. Instantaneous velocities of a squirmer in an annular confinement as a function of eccentricity for an orientation of s = 30. (a) neutral swimmer (B1 = 0, B2 = 0) and (b) shaker (B1 = 0, B2 = 0). Continuous lines are expressions based on
simple superposition (Eq. 22­23), and markers indicate the results obtained from the numerical simulations.

The results are illustrated in Fig. 12. The match between the simulations and the approximate expressions is better for the case of a neutral swimmer (B1 = 0, B2 = 0) compared to a shaker (B1 = 0, B2 = 0). This better match for a neutral swimmer is due to the rapid decay of the velocity field generated by it. In an unbounded domain, the velocity field generated by B1 mode decays as 1/r2. Moreover, in the annular confinement, the strength of the Stokeslet velocity field generated by the convex post in response to the disturbance flow generated by the neutral swimmer is weaker, and is further suppressed by the outer concave confinement. Thus the approximate expressions obtained by superposition of velocities due to concave and convex surfaces agree well with the results from simulations in the case of neutral swimmer.
However, in the case of a B2 mode, the velocity field generated by the squirmer decays slower as 1/r in an unbounded fluid domain. Moreover, in the annular confinement, the strength of the disturbance velocity field generated by the convex post (Stokeslet) in response to the flow generated by the shaker is also stronger. Of course, the concave confinement will suppress this disturbance velocity field. However, these hydrodynamic interactions are not taken into account in the approximate expressions and thus they deviate from the full numerical results for shaker more compared to a neutral swimmer.
