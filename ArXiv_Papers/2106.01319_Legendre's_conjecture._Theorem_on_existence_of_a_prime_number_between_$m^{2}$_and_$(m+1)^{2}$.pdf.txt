Introduction
In paper [1], we explored a T -matrix: examined the simplest properties of T -matrix, proved the basic theorems about elements of T -matrix, found her applications in number theory. In paper [2], we established the connection between T -matrix and Legendre's conjecture, got
Weak and Strong conjectures. In this paper, we will present one proof of Legendre's conjecture using a scheme for finding
Hm4, Cm4 for number m4 at each m 3.

1. About elements of T -matrix

We will first introduce the support constructions, definitions, propositions from [1], [2]. Construct a matrix T  (a(k; n))×, where a(k; n) is a T -matrix element located in k-th row, n-th column and defined as follows:

a(k; n)  p(k) ·

5+2·

n 2

+4·

n-1 2

,

where p(k) is the k-th element of sequence (p(k)) k=1 of prime numbers:

p(k)  pk+2,

(1)

where pi is the i-th prime number in sequence of all prime numbers. Let (f (n)) n=1 is a numerical sequence, where a common member f (n) is defined as follows: f (n)  3n + 3 - (-1)n . 2

THEOREM 1.1.

(k,n  N) (a(k; n) = p(k) · f (n)) .

DEFINITION 1.1. An element a(k; n) of matrix T is called defining (a(k; n)  DT ) if 1) a(k; n) is not divisible by 5; 2) a(k; n) can be expressed as a product of some two prime numbers, that is

5 |a(k; n)  (u,v  P)(a(k; n) = u · v).

(2)

DEFINITION 1.2. An element a(k; n) of matrix T is called not defining (a(k; n)  nDT ) if he does not satisfy condition (2).
DEFINITION 1.3. An element a(k; n) of matrix T is called leading (a(k; n)  MT ) if
a(k; n) = p2(k).

DEFINITION 1.4. A T -matrix is called matrix comprising all defining and not defining elements.
LEMMA 1.2. (f (n)) n=1 is a sequence of all numbers of the form 6h ± 1:
5; 7; 11; 13; 17; 19; 23; 25; ... ; 6h - 1; 6h + 1; ....

DEFINITION 1.5. A T -matrix defining element D(b) is called an upper defining element of number b  R : b 49, if

D(b) = min a(k1; n), a(k1 ;n)DT
a(k1 ;n)>b nN

where k1 is defined by condition

p2(k1)

=

max
p2(k) b

p2(k).

k>1

THEOREM 1.3 (about the transition down of T -matrix defining element).

(k; n  N) p2(k) < a(k; n)  a(k; n)  DT   (! j  N) k < j  a(k; n) < p2(j)  a(j; #k(p2(k))) = a(k; n)  a(j; n) = p2(j) .

2. About scheme for getting Hm4, Cm4 for number m4 (m 3)
Let any natural number m 3 is chosen, and the leading element p2(k1) of T -matrix is found by condition:

p2(k1)

=

max
p2(k)<m4

p2(k), where

k1

 k1(m).

(3)

k>1

THEOREM 2.1.

(x  R) x 3  (x) = MT x2 + 2 (see [1]).

(4)

Now find a k1-row of T -matrix.





MT (p2(k1))

(=3)

MT

 max p2(k)<m4

p2(k) = max p2(k)<m4

MT (p2(k))

= max ((p(k)) - 2) p2(k)<m4

(=1)

max
p2(k)<m4

((pk+2) - 2) =

k>1

k>1

= max ((k + 2) - 2) = max k.

p2(k)<m4

k>1

MT (p2(k1)) (=4) (p(k1)) - 2 (=1) (pk1+2) - 2 = (k1 + 2) - 2 = k1.

It follows that

In paper [2], the definition of active set H(m-1)4, m4 and definition of critical element C(m-1)4, m4 for numbers (m - 1)4, m4 (m 3) were introduced under the assumption

3

that Legendre's conjecture is true for number m - 1. By removing this assumption, we will
formulate 3 definitions. DEFINITION 2.1. A set Hm4  DTk1(m) of all defining elements a(k1; ni) > p2(k1) (in
k1-row of T -matrix), i = 1; qm , in which

a(k1; ni) < m4 < p2(ji) < (m + 1)4 , m4 < a(k1; ni) < p2(ji) < (m + 1)4

where n1 < n2 < ... < nqm, ji = k1 + i; is called an active set for number m4 (m 3). DEFINITION 2.2. A defining element Cm4  a(k1; nqm+1) / Hm4, next to a defining
element a(k1; nqm)  Hm4 (qm > 0), is called a critical element for number m4 (m 3). Take Cm4  D(p2(k1)) if qm = 0 for some m 3. In this case, Hm4 = . DEFINITION 2.3. A transition of the defining element a(k1; ni) > p2(k1) from k1-row
to ji-row (ji > k1) of T -matrix with some i  N is called successful if a(k1; ni)  H(m-1)4, m4. Otherwise, that is if a(k1; ni) / H(m-1)4, m4, this transition is called unsuccessful.
Scheme 1 for getting Hm4 , Cm4 for number m4 (m 3, k1  k1(m)).

p2(k1(m))  k1k1 a(k1; n1)  k1k1+1 a(k1 + 1; #k1(p2(k1)))  k1+1k1 a(k1; n2)  k1k1+2

 k1k1+2 a(k1 + 2; #k1(p2(k1)))  k1+2k1 ...  k1+qm-1k1 a(k1; nqm)  k1k1+qm

 k1k1+qm a(k1 + qm; #k1 (p2(k1)))  k1+qmk1 a(k1; nqm+1)  k1k1+qm+1

 k1k1+qm+1 a(k1 + qm + 1; #k1(p2(k1)))  k1+qm+1k1+qm p2(k1(m + 1)).

Here a ij b indicates the transition from element a  DTi in i-row to element b  DTj in j-row of T -matrix.

a(k1; ni+1) is a defining element, next to a defining element a(k1; ni), i  N. From the above Scheme 1, we get:

1) Hm4 = {a(k1; n1),..., a(k1; nqm)} , where p2(k1) < a(k1; n1) < ... < a(k1; nqm). 2) Cm4 = a(k1; nqm+1), where Cm4 > a(k1; nqm). 3) p2(k1(m + 1)) = a(k1 + qm; nqm), where

k1(m + 1) = k1(m) + qm.

Description of Scheme 1. Find a leading element p2(k1(m)) in k1-row of T -matrix for a given number m 3. It should be reminded that p2(k1(m)) is maximal leading element that is less than m4. In k1-row of T -matrix, move from leading element p2(k1(m)) to defining element a(k1; n1).
Move from a(k1; n1) in k1-row of T -matrix to defining element a(k1 + 1; #k1(p2(k1))) in k1 + 1-row of T -matrix. By Theorem 1.3,

a(k1 + 1; #k1(p2(k1))) = a(k1; n1).

4

The transition of defining element a(k1; n1) > p2(k1) from k1-row to k1 + 1-row of T matrix is successful. Therefore we will move from defining element a(k1 + 1; #k1(p2(k1))) in k1 + 1-row of T -matrix to defining element a(k1; n2) in k1-row of T -matrix.
Move from a(k1; n2) in k1-row of T -matrix to defining element a(k1 + 2; #k1(p2(k1))) in k1 + 2-row of T -matrix. By Theorem 1.3,

a(k1 + 2; #k1(p2(k1))) = a(k1; n2).

The transition of defining element a(k1; n2) > p2(k1) from k1-row to k1 + 2-row of T matrix is successful. Therefore we will move from defining element a(k1 + 2; #k1(p2(k1))) in k1 + 2-row of T -matrix to defining element a(k1; n3) in k1-row of T -matrix. And so on to defining element a(k1; nqm) in k1-row of T -matrix.
Move from a(k1; nqm) in k1-row of T -matrix to defining element a(k1 + qm; #k1(p2(k1))) in k1 + qm-row of T -matrix. By Theorem 1.3,

a(k1 + qm; #k1(p2(k1))) = a(k1; nqm).

The transition of defining element a(k1; nqm) > p2(k1) from k1-row to k1 + qm-row of T matrix is successful. Therefore we will move from defining element a(k1 + qm; #k1(p2(k1))) in k1 + qm-row of T -matrix to defining element a(k1; nqm+1) in k1-row of T -matrix.
Move from a(k1; nqm+1) in k1-row of T -matrix to defining element a(k1+qm+1; #k1(p2(k1))) in k1 + qm + 1-row of T -matrix. By Theorem 1.3,

a(k1 + qm + 1; #k1(p2(k1))) = a(k1; nqm+1).

The transition of defining element a(k1; nqm+1) > p2(k1) from k1-row to k1 + qm + 1-row of T -matrix is unsuccessful. In this case, we will move from a(k1 + qm + 1; #k1(p2(k1))) in k1 + qm + 1-row of T -matrix to leading element p2(k1(m + 1)) in k1 + qm-row of T -matrix. In turn, p2(k1(m + 1)) is maximal leading element that is less than (m + 1)4.

3. Proof of Legendre's conjecture

THEOREM 3.1. Set MT is infinite (see [1]).

Note that properties and propositions about active set H(m-1)4, m4 for numbers (m-1)4,

m4 (see [2]) will also be true for active set Hm4 for number m4 (m 3).

Definition 2.1 makes it clear that (m 3) (|Hm4| = qm). Therefore, set Hm4 is finite.

Let's

define

the

set

D Tk1 (m)

as

follows:

D   Tk1(m)

a  DTk1(m) | p2(k1(m)) < a

Cm4 .

It follows from Definition 2.1 that

Hm4 = a  DTk1(m) | p2(k1(m)) < a < Cm4 . 5

In turn,

Hm4



D \  Tk1 (m)

Hm4

=

{Cm4} .

THEOREM 3.2 (theorem on existence of a prime number between m2 and (m + 1)2).

(m  N) (p  P) p  m2; (m + 1)2 .

PROOF. The Legendre's conjecture is true for m  {1; 2}. For example, the prime number p = 2 lies between 12 and 22, the prime number p = 5 lies between 22 and 32.
Further, we consider the Legendre's conjecture for m 3. Suppose otherwise: (m 3) (p  P) (p  (m2; (m + 1)2)) . This is equivalent to the next:

(m 3) (q  MT ) q  m4; (m + 1)4 .

Let's assume we found a number m0 3 such that

(q  MT ) q  m40; (m0 + 1)4 .

Using (5), we find k1(m0)-row of T -matrix:

Then,

k1(m0)

=

max
p2(k)<m40

k.

k>1

Given Theorem 3.1,

p2(k1(m0))

=

max
p2(k)<m40

p2(k).

k>1

(s  N) p2(k1(m0) + 1)  m40; (m0 + s)4   p2(k1(m0) + 1)  (m0 + s)4; (m0 + s + 1)4 .
Fix such found number s. Let k1  k1(m0). Using Scheme 1, construct scheme for m40, starting with leading element p2(k1(m0)):

p2(k1(m0))  k1k1 a(k1; n1)  k1k1+1 a(k1 + 1; #k1(p2(k1)))  k1+1k1 p2(k1(m0 + 1)).

k1(m0 + 1) (=6) k1(m0) + qm0 = k1(m0) + 0 = k1(m0) 

 a(k1 + 1; #k1(p2(k1))) = a(k1; n1) = D(p2(k1)) 

 p2(k1(m0))  k1k1 D(p2(k1))  k1k1+1 D(p2(k1))  k1+1k1 p2(k1(m0)).

(7)

Scheme (7) will be the same for numbers m40,...,(m0 + s - 1)4 because

k1(m0) = k1(m0 + 1) (=6) ... (=6) k1(m0 + s).

(8)

With such found number s we get from scheme (7) and from equalities (8):
1) H(m0+i)4 = , i = 0; s - 1. 2) C(m0+i)4 = D(p2(k1(m0))),where C(m0+i)4 > p2(k1(m0)), i = 0; s - 1. 3) p2(k1(m0)) = p2(k1(m0 + 1)) = ... = p2(k1(m0 + s)). Introduce, m  m0 + s - 1. It can be considered that k1  k1(m). In this case, there is a following scheme for number m4:

p2(k1(m))  k1k1 D(p2(k1))  k1k1+1 D(p2(k1))  k1+1k1 p2(k1(m + 1)).

k1(m + 1) (=6) k1(m) + qm = k1(m) + 0 = k1(m)  k1(m + 1) = k1(m).

=

Hm4 .

(10)

Using Scheme 1 again, construct scheme for (m + 1)4, starting with leading element

p2(k1(m + 1)) (=9) p2(k1(m)).

p2(k1(m + 1))  k1k1 a(k1; n1)  k1k1+1 a(k1 + 1; #k1 (p2(k1)))  k1+1k1 ...  k1+qm+1-1k1

 k1+qm+1-1k1 a(k1; nqm+1 )  k1k1+qm+1 a(k1 + qm+1; #k1 (p2(k1)))  k1+qm+1k1

 k1+qm+1k1 a(k1; nqm+1+1) k1  k1+qm+1+1 a(k1 + qm+1 + 1; #k1 (p2(k1)))  k1+qm+1+1k1+qm+1

 k1+qm+1+1k1+qm+1 p2(k1(m + 2)).

From the above scheme, we get: 1) H(m+1)4 = {a(k1; n1),..., a(k1; nqm+1)} , where p2(k1) < a(k1; n1) < ... < a(k1; nqm+1). 2) C(m+1)4 = a(k1; nqm+1+1), where C(m+1)4 > a(k1; nqm+1). 3) p2(k1(m + 2)) = a(k1 + qm+1; nqm+1), where k1(m + 2) (=6) k1(m + 1) + qm+1. Further,
H(m+1)4 = C(m+1)4 .
a(k1 + 1; #k1(p2(k1))) = a(k1; n1) = D(p2(k1(m + 1))) (=9) D(p2(k1(m))) = Cm4 

 Cm4  H(m+1)4 .

(11)

(11) makes it clear that Cm4 = C(m+1)4 .

D =  Tk1 (m+1)

C(m+1)4 =
