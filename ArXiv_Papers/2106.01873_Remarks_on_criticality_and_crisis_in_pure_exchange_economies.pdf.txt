Dedicated to the memory of A. Granas
Abstract. In the framework of Balasko's theory of Equilibrium Manifold in a Pure Exchange Market Economy, we introduce the concept of crisis and unavoidable crisis equilibrium, establishing some infinitesimal criteria which allow us to distinguish the unavoidable crisis from a general critical equilibrium. The proofs build on the relationship between the mathematical concepts of branching, envelopes, and the intrinsic derivative.

Introduction
Y yo pienso que, para la Ciencia, hay que temer como una enfermedad el ir buscando una justificación fuera de sí misma, así como hay que temer en el hombre la pregunta del fin, del ¿para qué ? de la vida. Ustedes saben cuanta filosofía desesperada se halla en el fondo de esta pregunta; y sin embargo se vive por el amor a la vida, por el amor a los hijos, por el amor a la humanidad. Así es para la ciencia: las teorías valen por la luz interior que han dado a quien las creó, valen por la luz que dan todavía a quien las estudia, no importa que esta luz pueda derivar de una pregunta del entendimiento puro o de una de la ciencia aplicada. El fin de la vida es la vida digna y el fin de la ciencia es la ciencia digna; mas el juicio de la dignidad sale sólo de nuestra conciencia, por lo cual están igualmente lejanas de la verdad ambas fórmulas: la de la ciencia para la práctica y la de la ciencia para la ciencia.

This article ultimately deals with the relationship between three mathematical objects: branching, envelopes, and the intrinsic derivative. This relationship has been studied in Calculus of Variations, Differential Geometry and Bifurcation Theory since the introduction of conjugate points by G.G.J.Jacobi. However, our aim here is to explain the possible relevance of this relationship to mathematical economics and, more precisely, to an approach to Walras equilibria initiated by Yves Balasko in the seventies. Since then there has been a considerable progress in topological bifurcation theory [23], and we believe that some of the results and methods of this theory can be helpful in understanding and completing Balasko's work.
In the Arrow-Debreu model of Pure Exchange Economy, regular economies have a fundamental role. Identifying the economy with the corresponding aggregate endowment vector, these are the regular values of the projection to the endowments restricted to the graph of the Walras correspondence W. To consider regular values of this map make sense since Balasko [6] showed that the graph of W is a submanifold E of the Cartesian product of the price simplex S with the aggregate commodity space , called by him The Equilibrium Manifold.
More precisely: according to Balasko, an equilibrium is a pair e = (p, )  S ×  where    is the initial aggregate endowment of the market traders (in short an economy), and p  S is the associated equilibrium price, namely a price vector p at which the aggregate excess demand z(p, ) of the market vanishes. Denoting with W () the set of equilibrium prices associated to a given economy , the equilibrium manifold E is the graph of the multivalued correspondence W. In other words, the equilibrium manifold is the set E = {(p, )  S × | z(p, ) = 0}, endowed with the smooth structure of a submanifold of S × . The natural projection, or Debreu map,  : E   is the restriction to E of the projection of S ×  onto .
A regular point of  is a point e where the differential D(e) : Te(E)  T() is an isomorphism between the two tangent spaces. Regular points of  are called regular equilibria in mathematical economics. The complement of the open set R of regular equilibria is the set C of critical equilibria. A regular economy is an endowment    such that every point in the inverse image -1() is a regular equilibrium. The main virtue of regular economies is due to the fact that for

CRITICALITY AND CRISIS

every economy  close enough to  one can select a unique, smoothly depending equilibrium price p( ) close to a given equilibrium price p associated with . Indeed, under appropriate assumptions on the utility functions the map  : E   is proper, and this together with the invertibility of the differential implies that, for every regular economy , the fiber E = -1() is a finite subset of E, and moreover every element (p, )  E has an open neighborhood in E diffeomorphic to a fixed neighborhood N of  in . The inverse diffeomorphism composed with the projection on S defines a smooth local selection of equilibrium prices on N.
Is not the smoothness but rather the continuity of price selections which are considered by Balasko and others as being fundamental for a well-behaved trade market. "The discontinuity property of equilibrium price selections contradicts an assumption that underlies, implicitly at least, many policy-oriented fields as, for example, international trade theory or public economics"[10].
Critical (or singular) economies, i.e, those which contain at least one critical equilibrium on its fiber are frequently tied, at least heuristically, to economical crises understood from the mathematical viewpoint as a sudden jump of equilibrium prices of the market due to the discontinuity of any local choice of a unique equilibrium price in a neighborhood of an equilibrium belonging to E.
"This apparently inexplicable and unpredictable discontinuity leads to the serious, sometimes heated questioning of the market mechanism, and even to irrational behavior that occasionally ends in widespread destruction of resources through futile attempts to get back to the former price levels"[2].
However, there is a long-overdue need to clarify the above interpretation of critical equilibria in terms of the economical crises. To some extent our interest in this issue arose from a mathematical description in [8] of the "futility of the attempts to restore prices", during an imaginary crisis of the market of artichokes in Bretagne (see Appendix A). Assuming some non degeneracy, analogous description holds true on a much broader context.
First of all, let us notice that our discussion of regular equilibria shows that the noninvertibility of D(p, ) is only a necessary but not sufficient condition for the appearance of jumps in equilibrium prices. In some cases, even when D(p, ) is noninvertible one can still associate continuously to every economy in a small enough neighborhood of  a unique equilibrium price close to p because a smooth map can be a local homeomorphism even at a critical point. One can easily build examples of critical economies with locally defined continuous selections of equilibrium prices (see Appendix B). As a matter of fact, the latter assertion holds for any isolated critical equilibrium if dim  is greater than three [34].
Our purpose is to take into serious consideration the previous heuristics and hence to refine further the analysis of critical equilibria by introducing the notion of crisis equilibrium together with the mathematical apparatus which allows to discover among the critical equilibria the ones that lead to a crisis. Our approach is topological and uses only some elementary facts from singularity theory [5].
By definition, a crisis equilibrium is a branch point of the natural projection . Namely, an equilibrium e = (p, ) is a crisis equilibrium ( or simply a crisis) if  fails to be a local homeomorphism at e. This is clearly equivalent to the nonexistence of continuous selections of equilibrium prices near  taking the value p at . A crisis economy is any economy    containing among the points of E a crisis. Since

not every critical equilibrium is a crisis, the problem arises in finding criteria that distinguish crisis equilibria from others. We will obtain some sufficient conditions for a given critical equilibrium to be a crisis that depend only on the second-order derivatives of  at e.
While the precise formulation of these infinitesimal conditions will be stated in the next section, roughly speaking they can be described as follows: we will show that an equilibrium e  E is a crisis whenever the differential D(e) has an odddimensional kernel and the intrinsic derivative of D at e  E, in some direction tangent to E, is an isomorphism.
The above two conditions are far from providing a characterization of crisis equilibria. As a matter of fact, using multi-parameter bifurcation theory one can find more general sufficient conditions for being a crisis. However, our criterium is interesting in its own, because, as we will show, any equilibrium e = (p, ) verifying the above conditions is an unavoidable crisis in the following sense: In every neighborhood of e there exists two regular equilibria e1 = (p11) and e2 = (p2, 2) such that every continuous path in E between e1 and e2 must traverse a crisis equilibrium. Equivalently, every path in  joining the two close economies 1 and 2 that can be lifted to a path in E between e1 and e2 must contain some crisis economy. To say it in mathematical terms, the set of crisis equilibria B separates E and ei, i = 1, 2 belong to different paths components of its complement.
Let E = (B) be the set of crisis economies. The natural projection restricts to a proper map  : E \ -1(E)   \ E which is a local homeomorphism. It is well-known [28] that such a map is a covering projection and hence possesses the unique path lifting property. As a consequence, at the level of endowments, we have the following alternative: any continuous path of economies between the two close economies 1 and 2 either intersects the set B of crisis economies or the unique lifting of this path with initial point e1 must have an endpoint belonging to E2 which is different from e2. This accounts for the futility in trying to bring back the equilibrium price p1 to a close price p2 by continuously modifying endowments without traversing a crisis and underscores the importance of out of equilibrium dynamics in price adjustment problems.
The problem of which one of the two alternatives arise is interesting by itself, but we are not going to deal with it here. Instead, we will show that, whenever the set of crisis equilibria B is "thin" in a very precise sense, and no unavoidable crisis occurs, then every economy either has a unique equilibrium or it is indeterminate in terms of comparative statics.
Unavoidable crises also bears relation to the appearance of the local Leontief's transfer paradox i.e., the possibility of improving the utility of the equilibrium allocation of a given trader by donating to other participants a small amount of his own endowment. While the local transfer paradox can be formulated only for regular economies, our results together with those of [38] allows us to conclude that every equilibrium verifying the two conditions of an unavoidable crisis can be arbitrarily approximated by unstable regular economies possessing a local transfer paradox. We leave a detailed discussion of this relation to the interested reader.
Our last result is the comparison between the approach to crisis equilibria via Balasko's natural projection and a more classical viewpoint, in terms of the critical points of the excess demand function. A side outcome of this comparison is a simple criterion for the appearance of an unavoidable crisis in terms of the aggregate excess demand.

The above is a rough description of the economic content of the paper and the main results. However, it would be unfair to relegate the mathematics of the manuscript to a mathematical appendix, as often do the economists, because it constitutes the main body and interest of the article. But, on the other hand, it would be incorrect to reduce the remaining part, as mathematicians typically do, to an application of a mathematical theory to economics. This simply wasn't how we taught about the problem.
Accordingly, we decided to divide the article into two equally ranked parts. The first one is devoted to a discussion of our contributions to the Arrow-Debreu model of Pure Exchange Economy along the lines of Balasko's approach to Walras equilibria. In this part, we strictly follow the notations of his book [11], from now on quoted as FTGE in the text.
In the second part, we introduce the mathematical apparatus needed for the proof of the results stated in the first part, and prove them in a more abstract mathematical framework, keeping in mind eventual applications to other fields. In this part, we use the standard notation in nonlinear analysis, reversing the order in which the variables and parameters appear. We also avoided the symbols used in the first part to spare further confusion.
Intending to make the content more accessible to a mixed public, we reduced the mathematical background to a minimum by working in finite dimensions only. Even so, some knowledge of manifolds and vector bundles appears to be unavoidable. Using the degree theory of [21] and the methods of [4, 20] most of our results can be extended to Fredholm maps between Banach manifolds with potential applications to the infinite horizon and infinite-dimensional economies [17, 9, 1].
Here are the details of both parts of the manuscript. In the first part, we shortly review Balasko's approach to Walras equilibria. Then we introduce the intrinsic derivative and state the main results of the paper: sufficient conditions for an unavoidable crisis, the analysis of markets with thin avoidable sets of crisis equilibria, and the relation between the intrinsic derivative of the natural projection and the intrinsic derivative of the reduced aggregate excess demand.
In the second part, we discuss the relation of the intrinsic derivative with envelopes and branching. As a motivation, we begin with the "Envelope Theorem" which provides a sufficient condition for points of the discriminant of a family of plane curves to belong to the envelope. Next, by relating the envelope to branching and using the intrinsic derivative, we extend the above criteria to the families of implicitly defined varieties in Euclidean spaces. Finally, after establishing a reduction property of the intrinsic derivative, we prove the theorems stated in the first section in a slightly more general setting.
There are three appendices. Appendix A is a description, taken from [8], of the anomalous behavior of market prices during a crisis. Appendix B contains examples of critical economies which admit a continuous selection of equilibrium prices and crisis economies. Appendix C is a short review of Brouwer's topological degree and the Bifurcation Principle of M. Krasnoselskij.

and global analysis of that time. The extra assumption of smoothness on utility functions needed in their approach had as a positive counterpart the local uniqueness of the associated prices in the case of regular economies. Shortly after, Balasko [6] developed a closely related approach based on analysis of the equilibrium manifold and the natural projection (or Debreu map). He also introduced singularity theory methods and the catastrophe theory of Thom in mathematical economics [7]. Since the definitions adopted by Balasko and his followers partially disagree with known standards, e.g., Balasko's equilibrium manifold, is different from the one of Smale [36], we shortly review some of his basic definitions and results, providing in this form a dictionary to his lingo.

The Arrow-Debreu model of pure exchange economy with m consumers and
l goods associates to each consumer an allocation vector, or commodity bundle, belonging to the consumption space X = Rl++, the strictly positive orthant of Rl, and a price vector p belonging to the positive orthant Rl++. We will consider the normalized prices. Choosing as numeraire the l-th commodity, these are pi = pi/pl which make the normalized price of the numeraire equal to one. Under this choice, the price "simplex" becomes the set S = {(p1, . . . , pl)  Rl++| pl = 1}.
The i-th consumer participating in the market is represented by its utility func-
tion ui : X  R and its budget set Bi = {x  X| p · x  wi} The utility function ui is smooth and satisfies the following assumptions:
i) Monotonicity: the gradient ui(x) of ui at every point x belongs to Rl++. ii) Strict quasi-concavity: The Hessian matrix D2ui(x) is negative definite on
each tangent hyperplane to the indifference surface ui(x) = r. iii) Necessity: The indifference surface ui(x) = r is closed in Rl for every r  R.
Under the above assumptions the utility function ui assumes its maximum on the boundary Bi = {x  X| p · x = wi} of the budget set at a unique point x = fi(p, wi) which represents the demand of the i-th consumer under the price system p and the budget constraint wi. The demand function fi : S × R  X of every consumer is smooth and satisfies the Walras law

(1)

p · fi(p, wi) = wi.

The consumer i enters the market with an initial endowment; a bundle of goods i  X. In this article the utility function of each consumer will be assumed to be fixed, while his endowment will be considered as an exogenous parameter of the market.
The demand of the consumer i in terms his initial endowment is given by

(2)

xi(p, i) = fi(p, p · i).

Putting  = Xm and  = (1, . . . m), the aggregate excess demand of the market is the map z : S ×   X defined by

m

(3)

z(p, 1, . . . m) = (xi(p, i) - i).

I =1

As a consequence of the Walras law for individual demand functions also the excess demand z verifies the same property. Namely, for every   ,

(4)

p · z(p, ) = 0.

Definition 1.1. An equilibrium is a pair e = (p, )  S ×  such that z(p, ) = 0.

CRITICALITY AND CRISIS

According to Balasko [10]  and p are the economy and the equilibrium price associated with the equilibrium e respectively. The monotonicity, strict quasi-convexity, and necessity assumptions imply that the set E of Walras equilibria is a submanifold of dimension ml of S × , and that the natural projection  associating to every equilibrium its economy is a proper surjective map.
The proof of this goes, roughly speaking, as follows: as a consequence of Walras law, the last coordinate of the map z is a linear combination of the first l - 1 coordinates. Therefore E is also the set of zeros of the reduced aggregate excess demand z¯ obtained from z by eliminating the last coordinate. A direct calculation shows that 0 is a regular value of the map z¯ and hence E = z¯-1(0) is a submanifold by the Implicit Function Theorem. That  is proper follows from the necessity axiom and properties of individual demand functions. Finally, the surjectivity and hence existence of an equilibrium for every initial endowment follows from homotopy invariance of Brouwer's degree (see the Appendix) and the uniqueness of the equilibrium price associated with a non-trade economy. Let us add in passing that E is diffeomorphic to the Euclidean space and hence connected.
We already discussed some of Balasko's terminology in the introduction and here we will stick to that one. Regular equilibria can be equivalently defined either as regular points e = (p, ) of  or points whose first coordinate p is a regular point of the partial map z¯ : S  Rl-1 [10, Proposition 4.5.4.]. Regular economies are the regular values of the natural projection. Using properness as in [29] one shows that every regular economy  has an evenly covered neighborhood, i.e., an open neighborhood N such that -1(N ) is a finite, disjoint union of open subsets of E diffeomorphic by  with N. Composing the inverse with the projection on S one gets a smooth local selection of prices close to any equilibrium price associated to . Non-regular equilibria and economies are called critical. They are seldom considered in economics, however, they have been studied in comparative statics using singularity theory, mainly in connection with the change of the number of equilibria of regular economies [3, 7].
For completeness, we will add another useful property of regular economies. Namely, that the set R of regular economies is open and that every economy can be arbitrarily approximated by a regular one. The first assertion holds because proper maps send closed sets to closed sets and hence the set of critical economies C =  \ R, being the image of the set of critical equilibria is closed. The second is a consequence of Sard's theorem according to which C is of Lebesgue measure zero.

1.2. The unavoidable crisis.
Definition 1.2. A point e  E such that the natural map  : E   fails to be a local homeomorphism at e is called crisis equilibrium (or simply crisis).
Thus, a crisis is nothing but a branch point of . Since the map  is proper it can be easily seen that an equilibrium e  E is a crisis if and only if every neighborhood of e in E contains two equilibria e = (p ,  ) and e = (p ,  ) over the same economy  but with p = p . It follows from the Implicit Function Theorem that the set B of crisis equilibria is a closed subset of the set C = E \ R of critical equilibria. However, the previous example shows that in general B is only a proper subset and we want to find sufficient conditions for a given critical equilibrium to be a crisis. Our main result is the following theorem:

8

JACOBO PEJSACHOWICZ

Theorem 1.3. If e = (p, ) is an equilibrium such that
i) dim Ker D(e) is odd ii) for some v  Te(E), the second intrinsic derivative v2(e) in direction v is
an isomorphism.
Then e is an unavoidable crisis. Namely, in every neighborhood of e in E there exists two (regular) equilibria e± = (p±, ±) belonging to different path components of E \ B. Equivalently every continuous path in E between e+ and e- must intersect the set of crisis equilibria B.
Proof. The equilibrium manifold E is connected and indeed diffeomorphic to a Euclidean space by Proposition 5.17 of FTGE. In particular, it is orientable. By Proposition 6.2 of FTGE, the natural projection  : E   is proper. Thus the hypotheses of Theorem 2.7 are verified, and Theorem 1.3 follows from this theorem.

The set E = (B) of all crisis economies is closed because proper maps send closed sets into closed ones. The restriction  : E \ -1(E)   \ E is clearly proper and a local homeomorphism. Proper local homeomorphisms are covering projections and hence possess the unique path lifting property. Thus, from the conclusion of the previous theorem, we get the following alternative which accounts for the impossibility to bring back the equilibrium price p to a close price p by continuously modifying endowments without traversing a crisis.
Corollary 1 (Impossibility to restore the price). If e± = (p±, ±) are the regular equilibria near e given by the previous theorem, then any continuous path in  between the two economies + and - either intersects the set E of crisis economies or the unique lifting of this path with initial point e+ must have an endpoint (-, p) with p = p-.
Proof. This is a special case of Corollary 4.
1.3. What if the set of crisis equilibria is thin and avoidable? Our next theorem explores what happens when the set of crisis equilibria neither separates the manifold E nor it contains interior points (closed sets with no interior points are said to be nowhere dense). It turns out that these two properties of B lead to the uniqueness of regular equilibria and more.
Theorem 1.4. Assume that the complement of the set of crisis equilibria E \ B is both connected and dense in E. Then for every   , the fiber E = -1() is a continuum, i.e., a compact connected set. In particular, if E contains some regular equilibrium e, then e is the only element of this set.
The mathematical property of local uniqueness of prices/equilibria, typical of the regular economies, is termed determinateness in comparative statics. Thus in terms of economic theory, the above theorem says that whenever the set of crisis equilibria is nowhere dense and unavoidable branching does not occur, then every economy either has a unique equilibrium price or is indeterminate.
Proof. By Proposition 6.34 of FTGE, the Brouwer degree of the natural projection  is +1. Now the result follows from Theorem 2.9 of the second part.

1.4. Crisis criteria in terms of the excess demand function. It is easy to see that a point e = (p, )  E is a critical point of the natural projection  if and only if p is a critical point of the reduced aggregate excess demand map z¯ : S  Rl-1, defined by z¯(p) := z¯(p, ), and moreover the differentials at both points have canonically isomorphic kernels. Our final result is the computation of the intrinsic second derivative  in terms of the second differential of z¯. This computation uses, together with a natural reduction property of the intrinsic derivative, some kind of duality which we tried to motivate using envelope theory for plane curves, but without much success, probably because we are still far from fully grasping its real nature. However, the result is of practical interest because it provides a simple criterium for the existence of an unavoidable crisis in terms of the first and second differential of z¯ at p.

Theorem 1.5. Given a point e = (p, )  E the inclusion i(v) := (v, 0) sends
isomorphically Ker Dz¯(p) into Ker D(e). In particular, e = (p, ) is a critical point of  if and only if p is a critical point of z¯.
Moreover, there exists a canonical isomorphism j : Coker Dz¯(p)  Coker D(e) such that for every v  Ker Dz¯(p),

(5)

i2(v)(e) = jv2z¯(p).

Proof. The first part follows from:

(6) Ker D(e) = Ker   Te(E) = Rl-1 × {0}  Ker Df (e) = i(Ker Dz¯(p)).

The second assertion is the thesis of the Theorem 2.13 in Part II.

As a consequence, spelling out the definition of v2z¯(p) = vDz¯(p), we obtain the following criterium:
Theorem 1.6. If e = (p, )  E verifies
i) Ker z¯(p) is odd-dimensional. ii) There exists a vector v  Ker z¯(p), such that
D2z¯(p)[v, u] / Im Dz¯(p) for all u  Ker z¯(p), u = 0.
Then e is an unavoidable crisis, i.e., the conclusions of Theorem 1.3 hold.
Proof. In order to obtain the above result from Theorem 2.14 we have to verify the hypotheses of this theorem. Clearly, we have only to show that E is locally bounded over . This would be a consequence of each z¯ being proper. Indeed, on finite dimensions, properness of z¯ on S is equivalent to z¯  , when p goes either to infinite or to the boundary of S. By continuity the above condition at p implies the existence of a bound for E on a small enough neighborhood of p. Unfortunately, as is shown in page 135 of FTGE, the map z¯ is not proper. However, using an idea of Balasko, we substitute z¯ with the map z~ defined by (7) z~(p1, . . . , pl-1, ) = (1 + p1)z1(p1, . . . , pl-1, ), . . . , (1 + pl-1)zl-1(p1, . . . , pl-1, )
Then, by Lemma 7.17 of FTGE, z~ is proper for all    and clearly E = z~-1(0). Thus E is locally bounded over  and the conclusion follows from Theorem 2.14.

2. Part II: Envelopes, Intrinsic Derivatives, and Branching

2.1. The envelope of a family of plane curves. There are in the mathematical literature no less than four different notions of envelope of an implicitly defined one-parameter family of plane curves Cz = {(x, y)|f (x, y, z) = 0}. Assuming that f is smooth the envelope of the family is frequently defined in one of the following forms:

· The set E of limit points of intersections of nearby curves of the family.1

· The plane curve E that is tangent to every curve of the family.

· The boundary E of the subset of the plane filled by all curves of the family.

·

The

set

D

=

{(x,

y)|f

y,

z)

0,

0}.

In general E, E , E and D differ one from the other, but in some cases, they all

coincide. A well-known example in which this happens is the envelope of ballistic

trajectories:

gx2 f (x, y, z) = x tan z - 2v2 cos2 z - y = 0.
Since our purpose is to extend to higher dimensions the relation between E, which we will call the envelope and D, called the discriminant, we will first shortly review the plane curves case.

By definition a point q = (x, y) belongs to E if there exists a sequence of
intersection points qn  Czn  Czn with zn = zn but zn, zn  z and qn  q. Notice that for every intersection point qn = (xn, yn) it holds that

(8)

(f (xn, yn, zn) - f (xn, yn, zn)) /(zn - zn) = 0.

If z = lim zn, then f (x, y, z) = 0 by continuity, while the Lagrange intermediate

that

Thus

A partial converse to the above is the following theorem [31] :

Theorem 2.1. (The Envelope Theorem) Let q  D  Cz be such that, denoting the partial derivatives as subindices, the determinant

(9)

(q) = [fyfxz - fxfyz](x, y, z) = 0,

then q  E. Moreover the curve Cz is a regular curve in a neighborhood of q, and there exist a parametrization  : (z - , z + )  R2 of Cz with (z) = q such
that (z) is the unique intersection point of Cz with Cz.

Proof. Define

if z = z if z = z.

Consider the map F (x, y, z) = (f (x, y, z), g(x, y, z)). Clearly F (x, y, z) = (0, 0) and the Jacobian determinant of F (-, -, z) at q = (x, y) is (x, y) = 0. By the Implicit Function Theorem there exists a parametrized curve (z) = (x(z), y(z))
defined in (z - , z + ) such that (z) = q and F ((z), z) = (0, 0). It follows from this that (z)  Cz  Cz , and therefore the point q belongs to E. That  is a parametrization of Cz is clear.

Corollary 2. If (q) = 0 for every q  D, then D = E.

2.2. An example: Conjugate Points in Calculus of Variation. While the

version E of the envelope is used mainly for the construction of singular solutions

to nonlinear differential equations, the version E adopted here arises in Calculus of

Variation by considering families of extremals through a given point of the plane.

Before the introduction of functional spaces in Calculus of Variations, it was

customary to identify the functions with the plane curves defined by their graphs.

Graphs of function arising as stationary points of the variational functional were

termed "extremals". Consider the variational integral (y) =

Cz = {(x, y)|f (x, y, z) := y - y(x, z) = 0}.

A point q = (x, y)  Cz is said to be conjugate to the point 0 = (0, 0) along

Cz if the Jacobi equation (the linearization of the Euler Lagrange equation of the

functional  ) has a nontrivial solution vanishing both at 0 and x. Such a solution

The first conjugate point is of particular importance in Calculus of Variation because at this point the curve loses its minimizing property. In [24] Jacobi gave a geometric characterization of the first conjugate point along a given extremal as the point where the extremal touches for the first time the envelope E of the family.
In older texts of calculus of variation the definition of envelope is the one adopted here. See for example the book of Bolza [12]. This also was the original viewpoint of Jacobi 2. However, because the discriminant D is considerably easier to deal with, the equality D = E in the case of extremals, contributed to blur the distinction between E and D in general and led many authors to refer to D as the "envelope".
Remark 1. Families of geodesics through a given point on a Riemannian manifold behave similarly. Appropriately reformulated, Corollary 2 holds true in this case as well. However, on semi-Riemannian manifolds, the envelope of the family can be a proper subset of the discriminant [26, 30].

2.3. Envelope, Bifurcation, and Branching. Our proof of Theorem 2.1 can be found in several prewar analysis books as an application of the Implicit Function Theorem. With the advent of Bourbaki's axiomatization of mathematics, it disappeared along with envelopes and many other shadowy concepts, only to reappear in a slightly different guise in the bifurcation theory of the nineties. As a motivation of our methods in the next section we shall briefly discuss the equivalence between Theorem 2.1 and the following lemma which constitutes the main step in the proof of the famous Crandall-Rabinowitz Theorem in bifurcation theory:

Lemma 2.2 (Bifurcation Lemma). Let f : I × R  R be a smooth function such

that f (z, 0) = 0 for all z. If:

f x

(z,

0)

=

0

and

2f zx

(z,

0)

=

0,

then

there

exists

a

smooth function z : (-, )  R such that z(0) = z and f (z(x), x) = 0.

Here the z-axis is a "trivial branch" of solutions of the equation f (z, x) = 0 and (x) = (z(x), x) is a nontrivial branch bifurcating the trivial branch at the point (z, 0).

It is important to notice that the Envelope Theorem and Lemma 2.2 are re-

lated by a form of duality. Namely if we exchange the role of z and x by taking

x as a parameter and z as variable then the Envelope Theorem applied to the

family of curves Cx defined by the equation F (z, y, x) := y - f (z, x) = 0 gives

the conclusion of Lemma 2.2.

Indeed,

since

the

point q = (z, 0)  C0 belongs to the discriminant D of the family. Moreover

The-

orem there exists a curve (x) = (z(x), y(x)) defined in (-, ) with (0) = q

and such that (x)  Cx  C0. But C0 is the z axis and hence y(x)  0. Thus

f (z(x), x) = 0, which proves the lemma. To reverse the order it is enough to notice

that any family of regular curves can be turned by a local change of coordinates

into a family of graphs y - f (z, x) = 0. Now to prove the Envelope Theorem in this

case it is enough to apply the Bifurcation Lemma to f~(z, x) = f (z, x) - f (z, 0), with

the z-axis as the trivial branch.

Remark 2. The bifurcation Lemma can be easily proved along the lines of the proof

of the Envelope Theorem. Simply, write f in the form f (x, z) = zg(x, z). Then

Theorem to g.

Our next observation is at the core of our approach to Balasko's equilibrium manifold.
Let Cz = {(x, y)|f (x, y, z) = 0} be an implicitly defined one-parameter family of plane curves such that 0 is a regular value of the function f. Then

E = {(x, y, z)|f (x, y, z) = 0}
is a surface in R3 , and each Cz is the image under projection (x, y, z) := (x, y) of the intersection of E with the horizontal plane Hz through z.
Lemma 2.3. Let  be the restriction of  to E. The discriminant D and the envelope E of the family {Cz}, z  R defined by f is the image under  of the set of its critical points and branch points respectively.

Proof. Using Tp(M ) = Ker Df (p) we have that at p = (x, y, z)  E

(11)

Ker D = Ker |Tp(E) = Ker Df  Ker  = Ker DF

where F (x, y, z)) = (x, y, f (x, y, z)). But the Jacobian determinant of F does not

vanish

at

p

and

only

if

f z

(p)

=

0.

Hence

p

is

a

critical

point

of



if

and

only

if

(p)  D.

The second assertion follows again by duality: a point q = (x, y) belongs to
E if and only if there exist a sequence of points qn = (xn, yn)  Czn  Czn with zn = zn but zn - zn  0 and qn,  q. Here the parameter is z but if we consider (x, y) as parameter and set z = lim zn we get pn = (xn, yn, zn) = (xn, yn, zn) = pn with (pn) = qn = (pn) and pn, pn  p = (x, y, z)  E which means that p is a branch point of  and q = (p).

Example 1. If E = {(x, y, z)|z3 - x - y = 0} then (0, 0, 0) is a critical point of the projection  : E  R2 but it is not a branch point, E being a graph of a function. Hence (0, 0) belongs to the discriminant D of the family but not to the
envelope E. In general, the envelope of a family of curves is only a proper subset of

14

JACOBO PEJSACHOWICZ

the discriminant. In the case of families of extremals, both sets coincide due to the particular nature of the Lagrangian.

Using Lemma 2.3 and the Envelope Theorem we can state a sufficient condition for a critical point of the projection  to be a branch point.

Theorem 2.4. Let f, E,  be as above. If e = (x, y, z) verifies
i) fz(e) = 0. ii) The determinant

(12)

(e) = [fyfxz - fxfyz](e) = 0,

then e  B. Moreover, there is a path (t) = (x(t), y(t), t)  E defined in (z - , z + ) with
(z) = e and such that also 1(t) = (x(t), y(t), z)  E.

2.4. The intrinsic derivative. In order to formulate our criteria, we will need the
notion of intrinsic derivative of a vector bundle morphism introduced in singularity
theory by Porteous [33].
Given two smooth vector bundles E, E over a smooth manifold M and vector
bundle morphism  : E  E , the intrinsic derivative of  at a point x  M
in direction of a tangent vector v  Tx(M ) is defined as follows: Let Ex, Ex be the fibers at x of the two vector bundles. On a neighborhood U of x take two
trivializations  : U × Ex  E|U and  : U × Ex  E|U such that x = Id Ex and x = Id Ex . Then  -1 is a morphism of trivial vector bundles and thus has the form (x , e)  (x , L(x )e) where L : U  Hom(Ex, Ex) is a smooth map. Let exp be any exponential map defined on a neighborhood of 0 in Tx(M ) with values in U. Then l(t) = L(exp(tv)), is a smooth path of homomorphisms defined in a
neighborhood of 0 in R.

Definition 2.5. The intrinsic derivative v(x) : Ker x  Coker x in direction v is defined by

dl

(13)

v(x) = k dt (0)i,

where i : Ker x  Ex and k : Ex  Coker x are the inclusion of the Kernel and the projection to the Cokernel respectively.

As its name says, this kind of derivation is independent of the choice of trivi-

alizations and the exponential map. Indeed, taking another pair of local trivial-

izations ~ and ~ of E|U and E|U , the corresponding L~ is related to L by L~(x ) =

A(x )L(x )B(x ), where A(x ), B(x ) are isomorphisms such that A(x) = Id = B(x).

Taking x = exp(tv) we get ~l(t) = a(t)l(t)b(t) with a(0) = Id = b(0). Hence, denot-

ing

with

l(t)

the

derivative

dl dt

(t),

we

have

~l(0) = a (0)l(0)b(0) + a(0)l(0)b(0) + a(0)l(0)b(0).

But then k~l(0)i = kl(0)i since the first term vanishes on Ker L(x) and the third belongs to Im L(x). The independence from the choice of the exponential map follows easily from the fact that D exp(0x) = Id : Tx(M )  Tx(M ).

Given a smooth map f : M  N between two manifolds, its tangent map or differential can be regarded as the vector bundle morphism Df : T (M )  f T (N )

CRITICALITY AND CRISIS

15

between the tangent bundle T (M ) of M and the pullback f T (N ) of the tangent bundle of N by f.

Definition 2.6. The intrinsic second derivative of f at x  M in direction of v  Tx(M ) is the intrinsic derivative of the morphism Df, i.e., v2f (x) = vDf (x).
2.5. Unavoidable Branching. Let M, N be smooth n-dimensional orientable manifolds and f : M  N be a smooth proper map. Let B the set of all branch points of f, i.e., points at which f fails to be a local homeomorphism. By the Inverse Function Theorem B is a subset of the set C of critical points of the map f.
We will need a local form of Brouwer's topological degree deg(f, U, y) defined on admissible triples (see the Appendix C). When y is a regular value of f in U the degree is explicitly defined by the formula

r

(14)

deg(f, U, y) = sgn Df (xi),

i=1

where f -1(y) = {x1, . . . , xr} and sgn Df (xi) = ±1, depending on whether the isomorphism Df (xi) preserves or reverses orientation of the tangent spaces. The multiplicity of an isolated point x  f -1(y) is defined by m(f, x) = deg(f, V, y), where V is any neighborhood of x such that V  f -1(y) = {x}. In particular, if x is a regular point of f, then m(f, x) = sgn Df (x) = ±1.
If f : M  N proper and N is connected, then, by homotopy invariance, the local degree deg(f, M, y) is independent of the choice of y  N and will be denoted with deg(f ).
To simplify notations, we will consider the branching of maps from orientable manifolds to Euclidean spaces. This is the only case that we will need here and the general case can be easily recovered from this one.
The following theorem illustrates well the nature of the topological methods in bifurcation theory. It draws a global conclusion from an infinitesimal criterium at a given critical point of f.
Theorem 2.7 (Unavoidable Branching). Let M be a connected orientable mmanifold and let f : M  Rm be a smooth proper map. If x  M verifies
i) Ker Df (x) is odd-dimensional ii) There exists a direction v  Tx (M ), such that v2f (x) is an isomorphism.
Then x is a branch point. Moreover, in every neighborhood of x there are two regular points x+ and x- of f belonging to different path components of M \ B. Equivalently, every path in M from x+ to x- must intersect B.
Remark 3. The regular points x± have opposite multiplicity.

16

JACOBO PEJSACHOWICZ

Proof. We first will show that x  B. The idea is to work in coordinates of M at x defined by the exponential map exp : U  Tx (M )  V  M. Let us take I = [-, +] with  > 0 and U small enough such that, putting

(15)

g(t, u) = f (exp(tv) + u) - f (exp(tv)),

the map g : I × U  Rn is well defined.
Let L(x) = Df (x) and l(t) = L(exp(tv)). Then Dug(0, 0) = l(0) = L(x). Let us choose an oriented basis of Tx (M ) of the form {e1, . . . , ek, ek+1 . . . , em} with {e1, . . . , ek} a basis of Ker L(x) and compute the determinant of the matrix of l(t) with respect to this basis and the canonical basis of Rm.
In terms of first order Taylor expansion of the columns we have [19]

(16)

det l(t) = d · tk + o(tk),

where

d = det l(0)e1, . . . l(0)ek, l(0)ek+1, . . . , l(0)em .

But l(0) is injective on Ker l(0) because kl(0) is injective there. Moreover l(0)
is injective on the subspace generated by {ek+1, . . . , em}. By assumption ii), no linear combination of the first k-vectors belongs to Im l(0). It follows then that
all column vectors in (16) are linearly independent and hence d = 0. Therefore
d(t) vanishes only at 0, and since k is odd det l(±) have opposite signs. By the
Krasnoselskij Principle (Appendix C) the map g has a bifurcation point from the
trivial branch u = 0 in I which, again by (16), must be t = 0. But, if g(tn, un) = 0, un = 0 and (tn, un)  (0, 0) in I × U, taking xn = exp(tnv + un), xn = tnv, we have xn, xn  x, xn = xn but f (xn) = f (xn). Therefore x  B.
In order to prove the second assertion let us consider x± = exp(±v). By the previous step x± are regular points of f of opposite multiplicity. They belong to different path components of M \ B as a consequence of the following lemma:

Lemma 2.8. Let M be a connected orientable m-manifold, f : M  Rm be a smooth proper map and let xi, i = 0, 1 be two isolated points in f -1(yi), i = 0, 1. If m(f, x0) = m(f, x1), then x0 and x1 belong to different components of M \ B.

Proof. Let  be a path on M with endpoints xi = (i); i = 0, 1. Without loss of
generality we can assume that  : I  M is an embedding. Take an open set  with smooth boundary such that (I)  ¯ , (I)   = {xi}. Then (I) is a neat

CRITICALITY AND CRISIS

17

submanifold of ¯ and therefore has a tubular neighborhood in ¯ [22]. This extends the embedding  to an embedding of the normal disk bundle
D = {(t, u)  (T (M ))|u   (t) and u < }
of (I) as its neighborhood in ¯ . Since I is contractible D is a trivial bundle and taking into account the trivialization we obtain an orientation preserving diffeomorphism  : I × D(0, )  I × Rm  M such that (t, 0) = (t). Much as before, we define h : I × D(0, )  Rm by

(17)

h(t, u) = f ((t, u)) - f ((t)).

Clearly 0 is an isolated zero of both endpoint maps hi = h(i, -), i = 0, 1. Moreover, since the degree is invariant under orientation preserving diffeomorphisms,
m(hi, 0) = m(f, xi), i = 0, 1. Under our hypothesis we have m(h0, 0) = m(h1, 0) and hence, by Krasnoselskij's Principle again, h must have a bifurcation point t from the trivial branch. It remains to show that y = (t) is a branch point of f and hence x0 and x1 belong to different path components of M \ B. Indeed, if (tn, un) is a sequence of nontrivial solutions h(tn, un) = 0, un = 0 converging to (t, 0), then xn = (tn, un) = xn = (tn), but f (xn) = f (xn) and xn, xn  x.

Corollary 4. With the hypothesis of Theorem 2.7 the following alternative holds, either y± = f (x±) belong to different path components of Y = Rm \ f (B) or, for any path  in Y from y+ to y- the unique lifting ~ : [0, 1]  M such that f  ~ =  and ~(0) = x+ must have the second end point ~(1) = x-.

Proof. In the first case every path between ±y must intersect E = f (B). In the second, if C is the component containing both points, we have that, being a proper surjective local homeomorphism, f : f -1(C)  C is covering projection [16, 14]. Therefore f possesses the unique path lifting property. However, by Theorem 2.7, the lifted path cannot have x- as the second endpoint.

2.6. What if B is never dense and avoidable? It is well known that isolated critical points of smooth maps f : M  Rm cannot be branch points if m  3 [34].
The next theorem will explore the kind of restrictions imposed on a map f such that M \ B is dense and connected.
The following theorem is a simplified version of Theorem 1.8 in [20].

Theorem 2.9. Let M be as above and let f : M  Rm be a smooth proper map such that deg(f ) = 1. Assume that M \B is connected and dense in M. Then f -1(y) is connected for every y  Rm. In particular, if f -1(y) contains some regular point
x, then x is the only element of this set.

Proof. By contradiction. Suppose that f -1(y) is disconnected. Take a cover of f -1(y) by two disjoint open sets of M , Wi, i = 1, 2 with f -1(y)  Wi = , i = 1, 2.
By the additivity and excision property of the degree

(18)

1 = deg(f, W1, y) + deg(f, W2, y).

At least one of the right hand side members does not vanishes. Assume that

(19)

deg(f, W1, y) = 0.

By the density hypothesis we can find a point x  W2 not belonging to B. Then, since f is a local homeomorphism at x, we can choose two open neighborhoods

18

JACOBO PEJSACHOWICZ

U  W2 and V  Rm of x and f (x) respectively such that f|U is a homeomorphism of U onto V. By Sard's Theorem V contains a regular value y of f.

Let f -1(y) = {x1 . . . , xn}. By the definition of topological degree,

n

(20)

1 = degb(f, M, y) = m(f, xi)

I =1

Since M \ B(f ) is connected, by Lemma 2.8 all the multiplicities m(f, xi) have to coincide. Substituting in (20) we get 1 = n · m(f, x1). It follows then that n = 1 and, being f|U : U  V a homeomorphism, U must contain the only solution of the equation f (x) = y. Therefore degb(f, W1, 0) = 0 in (26), which contradicts (19).

2.7. A reduction property of the intrinsic derivative. The reduction property that we need is as follows:

Lemma 2.10. Let E, E be two vector bundles over a smooth manifold M and let  : E  E be a vector bundle morphism. If F is a sub-bundle of E verifying

(21)

Im  + F = E ,

then F = -1(F ) is a sub-bundle of E and, if  : F  F is the restriction of  to F, then for every v  Tx(M ),

(22)

v(x) = j v (x),

where j : Coker x  Coker x is the canonical map Fx/ Im x  Fx = Ex/ Im x induced by the inclusion.

Proof. The fibers of F = -1(F ) are the kernels of the morphism  : E  E /F
which is surjective by (21). Hence F is a sub-bundle of E. Since the problem is local
and the intrinsic derivative is independent of the trivialization, we will consider al
bundles to be trivialized over a neighborhood U of x. We put E = U × W and
F = U × V with V a subspace of W, and similarly with E , F . We will denote
with i, i the respective inclusions. Then  on a fiber at m  U has the form
mw = (m, Lmw), with L : U  Hom(W, W ), and we are denoting with Lm instead of L(m) the value of L at m  U. Because of (21) L-m1(V ) = V for every m  U.
Let Lm  Hom(V, V ) be the restriction of Lm to V. We have Ker Lx = Ker Lx, and since Im Lx = V  Im Lx the projections to quotient k : W  Coker Lx and k : V  Coker Lx are related by j k = ki . Finally, denoting with j the inclusion of Ker Lx = Ker Lx into V and putting l(t) = L(exp(tv)), l (t) = L (exp(tv)), we have that l(0)i = i l (0) and therefore,

(23)

v(x) = kl(0)ij = ki l (0)j = j k l (0)j = j v (x).

We will apply the above reduction property together with the following invariance property of the intrinsic derivative which is a consequence of the chain rule.

Lemma 2.11. Let E, E be two vector bundles over a smooth manifold M and let  : E  E be a vector bundle morphism. Let N be a submanifold of M, and |N : E|N  E|N be the restriction of  to N, then, for every n  N and v  Tn(N ),

(24)

v = v(|N ).

We leave the proof to the reader.

2.8. Intrinsic derivative on implicitly defined manifolds.
Definition 2.12. An implicitly defined family of varieties in Rm parametrized by p  Rp is a family of the form Cp = {x  Rm|f (x, p) = 0} where f : Rm+p  Rp is a smooth map.
In what follows we will always assume that 0 is a regular value of f, i.e., the Frechet differential Df (x, p) is surjective for every (x, p)  f -1(0). By the Implicit Function Theorem, M = f -1(0) is an m-dimensional submanifold of Rm+p which is orientable because Df induces a trivialization of its normal bundle. Moreover Cp is the image under the projection map  : Rm+p  Rm of the intersection (Rm × {p})  M.
Let us denote by  the restriction of  to M. Guided by the case of families of plane curves (m=2, p=1) we define the discriminant D of the family as the set of critical values of , and its envelope E as the image by  of the set B of its branch points. We leave to the reader the reinterpretation of the envelope in terms of the family Cp, p  Rp analogous to the case of plane curves.
A comprehensive study of envelopes along the lines of Thom's paper [37] would require a stronger regularity condition, namely that Dxf (x, p) is surjective at points of M, together with properness, which would then imply that each Cp is a submanifold of Rm and pCp is a fiber bundle. But here all this is not needed since the only goal of this subsection is to compute the intrinsic second derivative v2(m) at a critical point m = (x, p) of , in terms of the map f.
For this, let us consider the map g = (, f ) : Rm+p  Rm×Rp, and its differential Dg : T (Rm+p)  g[T (Rm × Rp)]. Let E, E be the restrictions to M of the trivial bundles T (Rm+p) and g[T (Rm × Rp)] respectively. We claim that Dg|M verifies condition 21 with respect to the sub bundle F = M × Rm × {0} of E . Indeed, given a point m  M and an element e = (f , w )  Em by surjectivity of Df (m) we can find an e  E such that Df (m)e = w . But then e can be written as e = (e, Df (m)e) + (f - e, 0), which proves 21.
Denoting with  the restriction of the projection  to M we have D = |T M . Therefore Dg|M coincides with D as a morphism from F = Dg|-M1(F ) = Ker Df = T (M ) to F . By Lemma 2.11 and 2.10 for every v = 0 belonging to Tm (M ) we have

(25)

vDg(m) = vDg|M (m) = j1vD(m),

where j1 is the canonical isomorphism of Coker D(m) with Coker Dg(m).
On the other hand x is a regular value of the projection  : Rm+p  Rm, with -1(x) = {x} × Rp, and the restriction of Dg to {x} × Rp := N tautologically verifies condition 21 with respect to the sub bundle F = N × {0} × Rp. Moreover F = Dg|-N1(F ) = N × {0} × Rp, and hence Dg|N : F  F coincides with Df|N . Applying Lemmas 2.11 and 2.10 again, for every v = 0 belonging to Tm (N ) we have

(26)

vDg(m) = vDg|N (m) = j2vDf|N (m).

where j2 is the canonical isomorphism of Coker Dfx with Coker Dg(m).

20

JACOBO PEJSACHOWICZ

Since Ker D(m) = Ker |Tm (M) = Ker Tm (M ), every vector v  Ker D(m) is tangent to both M and N. Therefore, putting j = j1-1j2, from identities (25) and (26) we get

(27)

v2(m) = vD(m) = j vDf|N (m) = j v2f|N ,

for every v  Ker D. Let fx : Rp  Rp be the map fx (p) := f (x, p). Identifying N with Rp via the
map j(p) = (x, p), the morphism Df|N coincides with the morphism Dfx . With the same identification

(28) Ker D(m) = Ker   Tm (M ) = {0} × Rp  Ker Df (m) = Ker Dfx (p).

Clearly Coker Df|N = Coker Dfx , and hence we have

Theorem 2.13. A point m = (x, p)  M is a critical point of  if and only if p is a critical point of fx . Morever, Ker D(m) = Ker Dfx (p) and for every v  Ker Dfx (p)

(29)

v2(m) = j v2fx (p).

2.9. A criterium for unavoidable branching in terms of the defining map.

Theorem 2.14. Let f : Rm × Rp  Rp be a smooth map such that 0 is a regular value of f. Assume that M = f -1(0) is connected and locally bounded over Rm.
If m = (x, p)  M verifies
i) Ker Dfx (p) is odd-dimensional. ii) There exists a vector v  Ker Dfx (p), such that
D2fx (p)[v, u] / Im Dfx (p) for all u  Ker Dfx (p), u = 0.

Then m  B. Moreover, in every neighborhood of m there are two regular points m+ and m- of f belonging to different path components of M \ B. In particular,
B separates M.

Proof. That M is locally bounded over Rm means that every point y  Rm has a neighborhood U such that M  U × Rp is bounded in Rm+p. It follows then that the projection  : M  Rm is a proper map. Checking the definition of the intrinsic
derivative we find that for every u, v  Ker Dfx (p)

v2fx (p)u = qD2fx (p)[v, u],

where D2fx (p) is the second differential of fx at p and q : Rp  Coker Dfx (p) is the projection to the quotient. By dimensional reasons qD2fx (p)[v, -] is an
isomorphism if and only if it is a monomorphism, or equivalently if

Now the claimed result follows from Theorems 2.13 and 2.7

3. Appendices

3.1. Appendix A: Equilibrium Prices and Crises. We cannot resist but to quote word for word the vivid description of the relation between the discontinuity of equilibrium prices and an imaginary crisis of the market of artichokes in Bretagne by Balasko [8].

"Illustrons cette importance par un exemple quelque peu imaginaire mais qu'il n'est pas difficile de relier à une réalité plus concrète. Interprétons le marché considéré comme étant celui des artichauts sur un lieu de production comme la Bretagne et examinons la séquence des prix d'équilibre observés jour après jour. Au début de lasaison, les artichauts sont disponibles en petites quantités représentées par une valeur petite du parametre w ce qui dans le cas de figure donne un prix d'équilibre unique et relativement élevé. Chaque jour nouveau voit les quantités d'artichauts mises sur le marché augmenter, w se déplace donc vers la droite. Tant que w n'a pas franchi w" il y a unicité du prix d'équilibre. En outre, les variations de prix que l'on constate sont faibles : l'accroissement des quantités mises sur le marché ne se traduit pas par une baisse sensible des cours. Le franchissement correspond à l'entrée dans une zone d'équilibres multiples : trois équilibres sont alors possibles, mais le principe de continuité déjà vu permet de comprendre que le prix qui va être effectivement observé sur le marché est celui qui correspond à la branche supérieure de la courbe E. Autrement dit. l'observation du système de prix ne permet pas de mettre en évidence, donc d'identifier, une modification quelconque des caractéristiques du marché. Laissons les jours passer. Voici que maintenant w s'approche de w . Pour le moment rien de significatif n'est observé si ce n'est des variations un peu plus fortes du système de prix qui, bien que restant d'un ordre de grandeur relativement petit, n'en sont pas moins nouvelles. Ceci est du au fait que la pente de la tangente à E augmente régulièrement en valeur absolue. Des observateurs décrivant cette phase feraient état d'une certaine nervosité du marché. Puis arrive le jour où w, d'inférieur à w - lui devient supérieur. Le prix d'équilibre ne peut plus être prolongé infinitésimalement. En effet, pour la nouvelle valeur du paramètre w il n'y a plus qu'un seul prix d'équilibre possible et sa valeur est très différente de l'ancienne. Quelle situation observe-t-on alors sur le marché ? On pourrait imaginer qu'il a suffit d'un artichaut pour franchir w de sorte qu'il est pratiquement impossible pour un observateur économique de différencier les deux jours en question. Mais le marché fait cette différence quand il constate que les prix de la veille

n'équilibrent plus l'offre et la demande. Le marché commence par chercher à rétablir l'équilibre en procédant à de petites variations des cours. Mais contrairement aux jours précédents, aucune des petites variations possibles ne permet d'aboutir à un équilibre de l'offre et de la demande. Par conséquent, après un certain temps perdu dans ces efforts infructueux (il arrive souvent que le fonctionnement du marché soit alors suspendu afin de rétablir une certaine sérénité dans les esprits face à cette incapacité du marché à s'équilibrer), la constatation s'impose que si équilibre il y a, il va être très différent de celui de la veille. Pour les observateurs qui appliquent le principe que les mêmes causes ont les mêmes effets, cette discontinuité est inexplicable. C'est donc dans une atmosphère faite d'incompréhension voire d'incrédulité face aux événements que l'on voit le marché s'ajuster sur un nouvel équilibre. Cette phase est souvent accompagnée par une remise en cause passionnelle du mécanisme de marché, remise en cause justifiée par cette discontinuité en apparence imprévisible et inexplicable. L'aspect passionnel peut aller jusqu'à une destruction de ressources dans le but de faire remonter les cours : qui n'a entendu parler d'artichauts mis à la décharge publique ?"

3.2. Appendix B: Examples of Critical Economies. By the SonnenscheinMantel-Debreu Theorem every continuous function verifying on S the Walras law coincides on a compact subset of S with the aggregate excess demand function of a market with m  l, and fixed endowments.
Since the branching problem is of local nature, in order to find a critical economy that admits a continuous selection of prices it suffices to consider a m = 2, l = 2 market with the price of the second good normalized to 1. Take a reduced excess demand function of the form z¯(p, ) = (p - 1)3 - (2 - 1), where  = (1, 2) is the aggregate endowment. Its equilibrium manifold E is a graph. Each point e = (p, 1, 1, ) with p = 1 is a critical equilibrium that is not a crisis, since E posses a global continuous selection of prices p() = 1 + 3 2 - 1. There is a delicate point in this reasoning since we look at z as a function of both prices and endowment. However, since the problem is local, the version of the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu Theorem proved in [15, Theorem 4.1] suffices to guarantee the existence of the corresponding utility functions.
Several examples of critical economies with continuous price selections can be constructed on markets with two goods using quasilinear utilities of a special form considered in [27, 3]. Indeed in Figure 4 of [3] such an equilibrium manifold E is represented, separating regions of the uniqueness of equilibria from the region filled with manifolds with multiple equilibria. Much like the one described above this manifold is a graph of a continuous function having a vertical tangent at a critical economy. The authors used the Negishi approach which substitutes prices with social welfare weights but the results hold for prices too, since the prices are smooth functions of the social welfare weights.
The next example illustrates the criterium of unavoidable branching stated in Theorem 2.14. The example comes from [27, page 521] taken as an illustration of the existence of multiple equilibria. The two consumers have their preferences represented by quasilinear utility functions of type

Let (i, i), i = 1, 2 be the initial endowment of consumer i. The demand of each consumer is easily obtained using Lagrange multipliers for the constrained maxi-
mization of ui on the budget set px + 1y = wi. For the reduced excess demand we only need to consider the first good.

With  = 8 and taking 1 = 2 = 0.766 it turns out that z¯(p) vanishes together with its derivative at approximately 0.54 but z (0.54) = 0. therefore any endowment
veryfying 1 = 2 = 0.766 is an unavoidable crisis.

3.3. Appendix C: Brouwer's Degree and Krasnoselskij's Principle. We will use a local version of topological degree on oriented smooth manifolds. Given two oriented n-manifolds M and N, an admissible triple (f, U, y) is a triple defined by three admissible elements. Namely, an open subset U of M, a continuous map f : U  N and y  N such that f -1(y) is a compact subset of U.
Theorem 3.1. There is one and only one function deg which assigns to every admissible triple an integral number deg(f, U, y) verifying:
Existence: If deg(f, U, y) = 0, the equation f (x) = y has a solution in U .

Homotopy: If h : [0, 1] × U  Rn is a homotopy such that h-1(y) is compact, then deg(h0, U, y) = deg(h1, U, y).
Additivity: If Ui, i = 1, 2 are open admissible sets, then deg(f, U1  U2, y) = deg(f, U1, y) + deg(f, U2, y),
Excision: If U  V, are open sets and f -1(y) is a compact subset of U, then

deg(f, V, y) = deg(f, U, y).

The usual construction is made by assuming first that f is smooth and y is a regular value of f in U. In this case the degree is explicitly defined by the formula

r

(34)

deg(f, U, y) = sgn Df (xi),

i=1

where f -1(y) = {x1, . . . , xr} and sgn Df (xi) = ±1 depending on whether the isomorphism Df (xi) preserves or reverses orientation of the tangent spaces.

The extension to the general case is obtained through approximation of continuous maps by smooth maps and the use of Sard's Theorem in order to approximate y by regular values of the map f.
Let I  R be an interval and let f : I × Rn  Rn be a continuous family of C1 maps such that f (, 0) = 0 for all   [a, b]. The subset T = I × {0} of the set of all solutions of the equation f (, x) = is called the trivial branch. We will denote with f : Rn  Rn the map defined by f(x) = f (, x). In bifurcation theory we look for solutions of the equation f (, x) = 0 that are arbitrarilly close, but do not belong to, the trivial branch.
Definition 3.2. A bifurcation point from the trivial branch of solutions of the equation f (, x) = 0 is a point  in I such that every neighborhood of (, 0)   × Rn contains a nontrivial solution (, x), x = 0, of this equation.
The following lemma is an easy consequence of the homotopy invariance of topological degree
Lemma 3.3 ( The Krasnoselkij Principle). Let f : [0, 1] × Rn  Rn be a one parameter family of C1 maps such that f (, 0) = 0. If both Df0(0), Df1(0) are invertible and sgn det Df0(0) = sgn det Df1(0), then the interval (0, 1) contains at least one bifurcation point from the trivial branch.
Proof If there are no bifurcation points in (0, 1), for small enough r, the only solutions of f (, x) = 0 in [0, 1] × B¯(0, r) are the trivial ones. But then, by homotopy invariance deg(fi, B(0, r), 0) = sgn det Dfi(0), i = 0, 1, contradicting the hypothesis.
The extension of the above lemma to maps between oriented vector spaces needed in the proof of Theorem 2.7 is obvious.
