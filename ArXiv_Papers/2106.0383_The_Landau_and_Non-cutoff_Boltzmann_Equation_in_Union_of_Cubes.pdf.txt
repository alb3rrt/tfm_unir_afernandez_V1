THE LANDAU AND NON-CUTOFF BOLTZMANN EQUATION IN UNION OF CUBES
DINGQUN DENG
Abstract. The existence and stability of collisional kinetic equation, especially non-cutoff Boltzmann equation, in bounded domain with physical boundary condition is longstanding open problem. This work proves the global stability of the Landau equation and non-cutoff Boltzmann equation in union of cubes with the specular reflection boundary condition when an initial datum is near Maxwellian. Moreover, the solution enjoys exponential large-time decay in bounded domain. Our method is based on that fact that normal derivatives in cubes is also derivatives along axis, which allows us to obtain high-order derivative estimates.

1. Introduction

1.1. Equation and Domain. Boundary effects play a crucial role in the dynamics of collisional kinetic equation:
tF + v · xF = Q(F, F ), F (0, x, v) = F0(x, v),
where F (t, x, v) denotes the particle distribution at time t  0, position x   and velocity v  R3 and F0 denotes its initial datum. Throughout the paper, we consider the following two kinds of kinetic collision operator.

1.1.1. Landau collision operator. For Landau collision operator, Q is given by

Q(G, F ) = v · (v - v) G(v)vF (v) - F (v)vG(v) dv

The non-negative definite matrix-valued function  = [ij (v)]1i,j3 takes the form of

ij (v) =

ij

-

vivj |v|2

|v|+2,

where ij is the Kronecker delta and   -3 is the interaction potential between particles. It is convenient to call it hard potential when   -2 and soft potential when -3   < -2. The case  = -3 corresponds to the physically realistic Coulomb interactions; cf. [12].

1.1.2. Non-cutoff Boltzmann collision operator. For Boltzmann collision operator without angular cutoff, Q is defined by

Q(G, F ) =

B(v - v, ) G(v )F (v) - G(v)F (v) ddv.

that satisfy that v + v = v + v and |v|2 + |v|2 = |v|2 + |v |2. The Boltzmann collision kernel

Without

loss of generality we can assume B(v - v, ) is supported on 0    /2, since one can reduce

the situation with symmetrization: B(v - v, ) = B(v - v, ) + B(v - v, -). Moreover, we

assume

B(v - v, ) = CB|v - v| b(cos ),

for some CB > 0. |v - v| is called the kinetic part and b(cos ) is called the angular part. For non-cutoff Boltzmann case, we assume that there exist Cb > 0 and 0 < s < 1 such that

1.1.3. Bounded Domain. In this paper, we consider the bounded domain   R3 that is the union of finitely many cubes:
 = Ni=1i,
for some N  1, where i = (ai,1, bi,1) × (ai,2, bi,2) × (ai,3, bi,3) with ai,j  R. Note that  could be non-convex. Then  is divided into three kinds of boundary:  = 3i=1i, where i is orthogonal to axis xi and is the union of finitely many connected sets. We also assume that i is of non-zero spherical measure. Since the boundary of i's is of zero spherical measure, we don't distinguish i and the interior of i.
The unit normal outward vector n(x) exists on  almost everywhere with respect to spherical measure. On the interior of i(i = 1, 2, 3), we have n(x) = ei or -ei, where ei is the unit vector with ith-component being 1 and the other components being 0. We will denote vectors 1(x), 2(x) on boundary  such that (n(x), 1(x), 2(x)) form a unit orthonormal basis for R3. In this case,

xi g dx = gni dS(x) = gni dS(x).





i

The boundary of the phase space is

 := {(x, v)   × R3}.

THE LANDAU AND NON-CUTOFF BOLTZMANN EQUATION IN UNION OF CUBES

With n = n(x) being the outward normal direction at x  , we decompose  as

- = {(x, v)   × R3 : n(x) · v < 0}, + = {(x, v)   × R3 : n(x) · v > 0}, 0 = {(x, v)   × R3 : n(x) · v = 0},

(the incoming set), (the outgoing set), (the grazing set).

We consider, in this paper, the Specular reflection boundary condition:

F (t, x, v) = F (t, x, Rxv), on (x, v)  -, where Rxv := v - 2n(x)(n(x) · v).

There have been many contribution in the study of Boltzmann and Landau boundary value problems: [3, 4, 8, 13­16, 18, 20, 21, 27]. For global stability in the perturbation framework, since the fundamental work by Guo [13] on L2 - L method, there are plenty of results developed for Boltzmann equation and Landau equation. For instance, Guo-Kim-Tonon-Trescases [15] gave regularity of cutoff Boltzmann equation with several physical boundary conditions. EspositoGuo-Kim-Marra [8] constructed a non-equilibrium stationary solution. Kim-Lee [18] studied cutoff Boltzmann equation with specular boundary condition with external potential. Liu-Yang [19] extended the result in [13] to cutoff soft potential case. Cao-Kim-Lee [3] proved the global existence for Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann with diffuse boundary condition. Guo-Hwang-JangOuyang [14] gave the global stability of Landau equation with specular reflection boundary. Duan-Liu-Sakamoto-Strain [6] proved the global existence for Landau and non-cutoff Boltzmann equation in finite channel.
Despite extensive developments in the study of Landau equation and Boltzmann equation, many basic boundary problems such as the global existence and uniqueness of non-cutoff Boltzmann equation in bounded domain have remain open.

1.1.4. Reformulation. We write

F (t, x, v) = µ(v) + µ1/2(v)f (t, x, v),

where µ is the global Maxwellian:

µ

=

(2)-3/2

e-

|v|2 2

.

Then the function f satisfies

tf + v · xf = Lf + (f, f ) f (0, x, v) = f0(x, v).

(1.1)

where the linearized collision operator L and nonlinear collision operator  are given by

Lf = µ-1/2Q(µ, µ1/2f ) + µ-1/2Q(µ1/2f, µ),

and (f, f ) = µ-1/2Q(µ1/2f, µ1/2f ),

respectively. The specular boundary condition is given by

f (t, x, v) = f (t, x, Rxv), on (x, v)  -, where Rxv := v - 2n(x)(n(x) · v).

(1.2)

The kernel of L is the span of {µ1/2, viµ1/2(1  i  3), |v|2µ1/2}. Then we denote P to be the projection onto ker L:

Pf =

1.2. Main Result. Before presenting the main results, we specify some notations to be used
through the paper. Let v = 1 + |v|2 and  = x11 x22 x33 , where  = (1, 2, 3) is the multi-index. If each component of 1 is not greater than that of 's, we denote by 1  . We
will write C > 0(large) and  > 0(small) to be generic constants, which may change from line to line. I is the identity mapping. 1S is the indicator function on a set S. Denote the L2v and L2x,v, respectively, as

|f |2L2v =

Denote L2B to be the L2v space inside a ball B. Define the weight function

We assume the following condition on q and :

q = 0, for hard potential in both Boltzmann and Landau case,  
 = 1, for soft potential in Boltzmann case,

  [1, 2] and retrict q < 1 when  = 0, for soft potential in Landau case.

Note that for hard potential, we have w = 1 and hence E(t)  Ew(t) and D(t) = Dw(t). Moreover, we can write the conservation laws on mass and energy as

(1.14)

We will make a few comments on Theorem 1.1. Our main target throughout the paper is to study the global well-posedness for Landau equation and non-cutoff equation in union of cubes with physical boundary condition; namely, the specular reflection boundary condition. In union of finitely many cubes, one can define the normal derivatives as well as derivatives along axis on boundary by using the equation. They satisfy the specular reflection condition with sign ±; see Lemma 3.1. Then the boundary effect arising from v · xf vanishes with this nice property.
As illustrated in [15], there should be singularity at the boundary if the domain is a ball and the singularity may propagate for in-flow injection, diffuse reflection and bounce-back reflection boundary conditions [17]. Theorem 1.1 implies that Landau and Boltzmann equation have different behavior in cubes and in balls. Also, specular reflection boundary problem is different from other kinds of boundary conditions. In our case, we are able to construct Hx2L2v solutions.
The reason for choosing boundary  being union of cubes is the following. Firstly, normal derivatives in cubes is also derivatives along axis. It follows that we can estimate the highorder derivatives on boundary as normal derivative. In order to deal with normal derivatives on boundary, we will apply

v · xf = v · n(x)nf + v · 1(x)1 f + v · 2(x)2 f.

6

D.-Q. DENG

Together with equation (1.1), we are able to define the boundary value for nf :

nf

=

1 v·n

- v · 1(x)1 f - v · 2(x)2 f - tf + Lf + (f, f ) .

One can deduce that nf (x, Rxv) = -nf (x, Rxv) on v · n(x) = 0. This is also called the compatible condition. When deriving the energy estimates with derivative xi, it's necessary to note that xi is also the normal derivative on i. That is, xif = nf or xif = -nf on boundary i and we can derive the specular reflection boundary condition for high-order derivative, which is frequently used in this paper; see Lemma 3.1.
Next we give a short illustration for the vanishing boundary term. Taking inner product of v · xf with test function  over  × R3, the boundary term occurs:

v · n(x)f (x, v)(x, v) dvdS(x)
 R3

=

Rxv · n(x)f (x, Rxv)(x, Rxv) dvdS(x). (1.15)

 R3

Although we have (1.2), f (x, Rxv) has different properties when taking normal derivative and tangent derivatives; see (3.4) and (3.5). However, it's hard to evaluate f (x, Rxv) on boundary for general bounded domain., Therefore, we choose  to be union of finitely many cubes to ensure

that xi  {±n, ±1, ±2}. Then one can apply (3.4) and (3.5) to make sure (1.15) vanish with nicely chosen .

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give some basic estimates

for linearized collision operator and nonlinear collision operator. In Section 3, the macroscopic

estimates for Landau and Boltzmann equation was derived. In Section 4, we are able to prove

the global existence with the a priori estimates and the local existence. In Section 5, we give the

proof of local existence for completeness. The Appendix 6 is devoted to Carleman representation

for Boltzmann equation.

2. Preliminary

In this section, we provide several Lemmas on collision operator L and (f, g). The first Lemma is concerned with weighted coercive estimate on L. The second Lemma is devoted to the trilinear estimate on (f, g) with velocity weight.

Lemma 2.1. Assume   -3 for Landau case and  > max{-3, -2s - 3/2} for Boltzmann case. Then there exists decomposition for linearized collision operator

Proof. The proof of (2.3) can be found in [12, Lemma 5] for Landau case and [10, (2.13)] for Boltzmann case. The proof of (2.4) can be found in [25, Lemma 9] for Landau case and [7, Lemma 2.7] for Boltzmann case. Note from (1.5) that when   -2 in Landau case and  + 2s  0 in Boltzmann case, we have q = 0 and hence, w = 1. That is, it's not necessary to include any velocity weight in the hard potential cases. (2.2) follows from the (2.4) and the boundedness of K. Thus, we only prove (2.1) and the boundedness of K in the following.
For the proof of (2.1), we proceed in two cases.

Case I: Landau equation. For Landau equation, we will apply the decomposition L = A + K in [26, Section 4.2]. Let  > 0 small and choose a smooth cutoff function (|v|)  [0, 1] such that (|v|) = 1 if |v| < ; (|v|) = 0 if |v| > 2. Then we can split L = -A + K with

-Af

+ A1f

+ (K1 - 1|v|RK11|v|R)f,

(2.5)

Kf = vi i1|v|Rf + 1|v|RK11|v|Rf,

where R > 0 is to be chosen large,  > 0 is to be chosen small, and A1 and K1 are respectively given by

A1f = -µ-1/2vi µ ij   µvj µ-1/2f

,

K1f = -µ-1/2vi µ ij 1 -   µvj µ-1/2f

,

with the convolution taken with respect to the velocity variable v. Here and below repeated indices are implicitly summed over. From [12, Lemma 3], we know that

|ij (v)| + |i(v)|  C (1 + |v|)+2-||.

(2.6)

Then [26, (4.33)] shows that (Af, f )L2v  c0|f |2L2D .
Also, [26, (4.32)] and (2.6) implies that K is a bounded operator on L2v.

Case II: Boltzmann equation. We will use Pao's splitting as ~(v) = (v)+K(v); cf. [22, p.568 eq. (65), (66)] and [10]. Then (v)  v +2s and |K (v)| v  . We split L = -A + K with

-Af = (µ1/2, f ) + K (v)f - K (v)1|v|>Rf, Kf = (f, µ1/2) - K (v)1|v|Rf,

(2.7)

Then [10, Lemma 2.4 and Lemma 2.5] show that

((A - K (v)1|v|>R)f, f )L2v  |f |2L2D .

Here, by using |

Then choosing R > 0 large enough, we have

(Af, f )L2v |f |2L2D . Using [2, Lemma 2.1], we know that |(f, µ1/2)|L2v | v -C f |L2v for any C > 0 and hence,
|Kf |L2v | v -C f |L2v . This implies that K is bounded on L2v and completes the proof of Lemma 2.1.

Lemma 2.2. Assume   -3 for Landau case and  > max{-3, -2s - 3/2} for Boltzmann case. Then

Proof. The proof of (2.8) can be found in [12, 25, Theorem 3; Lemma 10] and [?, 7, 10, Lemma 2.3; Lemma 2.4; (6.6)]. Note that when   -2 in Landau case and  + 2s  0 in Boltzmann case, we have q = 0 and hence w = 1. That is, it's not necessary to include any velocity weight in the hard potential cases. To prove (2.9), we apply (2.8) to estimate

|(w2(f, g), h)L2v | dx

Plugging the above estimates into (2.10), we obtain (2.9).

In this section we will derive the a priori estimates for the macroscopic part of a solution to the equation:

tf + v · xf - Lf = g, f |t=0 = f0,

(3.1)

with boundary condition (1.2), where g is a chosen to be 0 or (f, f ). To find the macroscopic dissipation, we take the following velocity moments

with the inner product taken with respect to velocity variable v only, and the terms r and h on

the right are given by

r = -v · x{I - P}f, h = L{I - P}f + g.
Next, we derive the specular reflection boundary condition for high-order derivatives of solution to (1.1) and the boundary values for [a, b, c].

Lemma 3.1. Let f be the solution to (1.1) satisfying (1.2). Then we have the following identities on boundary (x, v) : v · n(x) = 0 and x belongs to the interior of i(i = 1, 2, 3) :

f (x, v) = f (x, Rxv),

(3.3)

and

j f (x, Rxv) = j f (x, v),

(3.4)

jk f (x, Rxv) = jk f (x, v),

for j, k = 1, 2, where (n(x), 1(x), 2(x)) forms a unit normal basis in R3. Then for the normal

derivatives, on (x, v) : v · n(x) = 0 and x belongs to the interior of i(i = 1, 2, 3) , we have

nf (x, Rxv) = -nf (x, v),

(3.5)

j nf (x, Rxv) = -j nf (x, v),

(3.6)

for j = 1, 2, and

n2f (x, Rxv) = n2f (x, v).

(3.7)

Proof. Recall that Rxv = v - 2n(x)(n(x) · v) maps - to +. Then by (1.2), we have that on i(i = 1, 2, 3),
f (x, v) = f (x, Rxv), on n(x) · v = 0.
Note that on i, Rxv sends vi to -vi and keep the other component the same while j (j = 1, 2) differentiate along direction xk with k = i. Then we have (3.4). Next we claim that

Lf (x, v) = Lf (x, Rxv) and g(Rxv) = g(v), on n(x) · v = 0,

(3.8)

for any x belongs to the interior of i. Indeed, by (3.3), it suffices to show that

(g1, g2)(Rxv) = (g1(Rxv), g2(Rxv)),

for any g1, g2. For the Boltzmann case, we apply the Carleman representation (6.1) to find that

(g1, g2)(Rxv) =

where we apply rotation Rx-1 on (, h). For the Landau case, we will apply the formula from [12, Lemma 1]:

(3.9)

Noticing vi g(Rxv) = -vi (g(Rxv)) on i, i = 1, 2, 3 and vi g(Rxv) = vi (g(Rxv)) on j, j = i, one can deduce that on i,

where we used ik(Rxv) = -ik(v), ji(Rxv) = -ji(v) when k = i, j = i. Similar calculation can be applied to second to fourth term in (3.9). Thus (g1, g2)(Rxv) = (g1(Rxv), g2(Rxv)) on i(i = 1, 2, 3). This completes the claim.
With the above claim, using identity

v · xf = v · n(x)nf + v · 1(x)1 f + v · 2(x)2 f, we can apply equation (3.1) to define normal derivative nf on interior of i:
v · nnf = -v · 1(x)1 f - v · 2(x)2 f - tf + Lf + (f, f ). Then by (3.4) and (3.8) we have

(3.10)

Rxv · n(x)nf (x, Rxv) = v · n(x)nf (x, v), on v · n(x) = 0,  x  i.

This gives (3.5). When g = (f, f ), we have ng = (nf, f ) + (f, nf ). Again using Carleman representation (6.1) for Boltzmann equation and (3.9) for Landau equation, we have from (3.5)

that

nLf (x, Rxv) = -nLf (x, v), ng(x, Rxv) = -ng(x, v),

(3.11)

on v · n(x) = 0, for x  i and

Rxv · 1(x)1 nf (x, Rxv) = -v · 1(x)1 nf (x, v), Rxv · 2(x)2 nf (x, Rxv) = -v · 2(x)2 nf (x, v),

on v · n(x) = 0, for x  i. These identities give (3.6). Again we apply the equation (3.1) and (3.10) to define second normal derivative n2f on interior of i:

v · nnnf = -v · 1(x)1 nf - v · 2(x)2 nf - tnf + Lnf + ng.

THE LANDAU AND NON-CUTOFF BOLTZMANN EQUATION IN UNION OF CUBES

11

Then applying (3.5), (3.11) and (3.6), we have Rxv · n(x)n2 f (x, Rxv) = -v · n(x)n2 f (x, v), .
on v · n(x) = 0, for x  i. This completes the proof of Lemma 3.1

Remark 3.2. (1) Note that (3.3), (3.4), (3.5), (3.6), (3.7) are only valid on the interior of i. However, the intersection of i's (the boundary of i's) is of zero spherical measure and hence, the integration on those intersection doesn't influence the whole boundary integration  = i i.
(2) Note that we are using the equation to define boundary value for f . One can also assume these boundary conditions initially and regard them as compatible conditions, since they are satisfied if the solution exists.

As a corollary, by definition (1.3) for [a, b, c], we have the following boundary value.

Corollary 3.3. For i = 1, 2, 3 and any x belongs to interior of i, we have

xi c(x) = xi a(x) = xi bj (x) = bi(x) = 0,

for j = i. As a consequence,

(3.12) (3.13)

Proof. Notice that nf = ±xif on i. Then by (3.5) and change of variable v  Rxv, we have on interior of i that

xi c = xi f (x, Rxv)|Rxv|2µ1/2(Rxv) dv = - xi f (x, v)|v|2µ1/2(v) dv = 0.

Similarly, on interior of i, we have

xi a = xi f (x, Rxv)µ1/2(Rxv) dv = - xi f (x, v)µ1/2(v) dv = 0.

For j = i, noticing (Rxv)j = vj on i, we have

On interior of i, we have (Rxv)i = -vi and hence by (3.3),

For (3.13), notice that for i = j, xixj a = 0 on i and xj a = 0 on j. Then

Similar argument

can be applied to c and one can deduce (3.13)1 and (3.13)3. For (3.13)2, notice that for j = i,

we have

Then we have

xixj bk = 0 or xj bk = 0, on i, xixi bk = 0 or xj bk = 0, on j .

This implies (3.13)2 and completes Corollary 3.3.

We denote (v) to be a smooth function satisfying

Applying

(3.15)

Let (t, x, v)  C1((0, +) ×  × R3) be a test function. Taking the inner product of (t, x, v) and (3.15) with respect to (x, v), we obtain

t(f , )L2x,v (t) - (f , t)L2x,v - (f , v · x)L2x,v

+ (v · n(x)f (x), (x))L2v dS(x) - (Lf , )L2x,v = (g, )L2x,v ,

where dS(x) is the spherical measure. Using the decomposition f = Pf + {I - P}f , we have

Estimate on c(t, x): We choose the following test function

(3.17)

The existence and uniqueness of solution to (3.17) is guaranteed by [11, Lamma 4.4.3.1]. In

particular, when || = 0 or i = 2 for some i, (3.17) is pure Neumann problem and we need  c dx = 0 and  xixi c dx = i xi c dS(x) = 0 respectively to ensure the existence of (3.17), which follows from (1.10) and (3.12). Similar to the proof for (3.13), by using boundary value of

c, we have

(3.18)

Here the second inequality follows from equation (3.17). We will discuss the value of  in two cases.
If || = 0, then (3.17) is a pure Neumann boundary problem and the solution is unique up to a constant. Thus, we can choose the constant carefully such that  c dx = 0. Then by Poincar´e's inequality, we have

c L2x

xc L2x .

By standard elliptic estimate of (3.17), we have

This implies that

(3.19)

c L2x .

Similarly, since t doesn't affect the boundary value for c, we have

b L2x + {I - P}f L2xL2D .

(3.21)

If || = 1, then i = 1 for some 1  i  3 and c(x) = 0 on i. Using the boundary value for c, i.e. xj c = 0 or c = 0 on j for any j, we have

(3.24)

where the second inequality follows from (3.2). If || = 2, as stated at the beginning of the proof, we only consider the case that i = 2 for
some 1  i  3. In this case, (3.17) is a pure Neumann boundary problem. Then for this i, similar to (3.22), by using boundary values xic = 0 on i from Corollary 3.3, we have

This implies that

For S4, we will use the boundary condition (1.2).
S4 = - (v · n(x)f (x), c(x))L2v dS(x).

We divide the integral on  into three parts: i, i = 1, 2, 3 and consider each i separately. Fix i = 1, 2, 3, then on i, we have n = xi or -xi and (1, 2) is the vector having components xj , with j = i and 1  j  3. Then

(v · n(x)f (x), c(x))L2v dS(x)
i

=

v · n(x)f (t, x, v)(|v|2 - 5) v · xc(t, x) µ1/2 dvdS(x). (3.27)

i R3

If i = 0 or 2, then from boundary condition (3.17) we know that xic = 0 on i. Applying change of variable v  Rxv, (3.27) becomes

v · n(x)f (t, x, v)(|v|2 - 5)

where we used (3.3), (3.4), (3.6) and (3.7). Note that Rx maps vj to vj for j = i. If i = 1, then k = 0 for k = i. Using boundary condition (3.17), we have xj c = 0 on i
for any j = 1, 2, 3, j = i. Applying change of variable v  Rxv to (3.27) and using (3.5) and (3.6), we obtain

v · n(x)f (t, x, v)(|v|2 - 5)vixi c(t, x)µ1/2 dvdS(x)

Notice that the above estimates are valid for i = 1, 2, 3. Then we obtain

m(x) = nk(x) = 0 on x  m, for k = m, if m = 0 or 2.

(3.29)

The existence of solution to (3.29) is guaranteed by [11, Lamma 4.4.3.1] and we will explain the conditions for pure Neumann type and mixed Dirichlet-Neumann type later. By using the boundary value of j, similar to (3.18), we have

Next we fix 1  j  3 and discuss the value of || as before. If || = 0, then j = 0 on j for j = 1, 2, 3. Then by [5, Theorem 6.7-5], we have

j L2x

Similar to (3.19), we can apply the standard elliptic estimate to obtain

(3.33)

If || = 1, then i = 1 for some 1  i  3 and k = 0 for k = i. In particular, if j = i, then
xii = 0 on i and xk i = 0 on k for k = i. In this case, (3.29) is a pure Neumann boundary problem and we need  xi bi dx = i bi dS(x) = 0 to ensure the existence for (3.29), which follows from (3.12). Moreover, xmi = 0 on a subset of boundary  with non-zero spherical measure for any m = 1, 2, 3. By [5, Theorem 6.7-5], we have

If j = i, then j = 0 on i and j while xk j = 0 on k for k = j, i. (3.29) is a mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary problem. By [5, Theorem 6.7-5], we have tj L2x txj L2x and j L2x xj L2x. Thus, by standard elliptic estimates for (3.29), we have

Next we assume || = 2 and  = xixi for some 1  i  3. Then for j = 1, 2, 3, j = 0 on j and xk j = 0 on k for k = j. Thus (3.29) is a mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary problem and by [5, Theorem 6.7-5], we know that j L2x xj L2x. Then from (3.29), we have

xi bj xi j dx,


where we used xibj = 0 on i from Corollary (3.3) for j = i and j = 0 on i if j = i. Then we have

Now we consider the boundary term S4. As in the estimate on c(t, x), we consider i for fixed i = 1, 2, 3:

=

v · n(x)f (t, x, v)jb,m(x, v) dvdS(x). (3.43)

m=1 i R3

If i = 0 or 2, then applying boundary condition (3.29), we have that for x  i,

xi j(x) = xj i(x) = 0, for j = i.

This shows that jb,m(x, v) is even with respect to vi when x  i. Noticing Rxv = v - 2v · eiei on i, we know that on i,
jb,m(x, Rxv) = jb,m(x, v).

Applying change of variable v  Rxv and using identities (3.3), (3.4), (3.6) and (3.7), (3.43) becomes

m=1 i R3

If i = 1, then boundary condition (3.29) shows that on x  i,

xj j (x) = 0, for j = 1, 2, 3, xm j (x) = 0, for j, m = i.

Then we know that jb,m(x, v) is odd with respect to vi when x  i and hence, jb,m(x, Rxv) = -jb,m(x, v).

Now applying change of variable v  Rxv and using identities (3.5) and (3.6), (3.43) becomes

3
v · n(x)f (t, x, v)jb,m(x, v) dvdS(x)
m=1 i R3

3

=

Rxv · n(x)f (t, x, Rxv)jb,m(x, Rxv) dvdS(x)

m=1 i R3

3

=

v · n(x)f (t, x, v)(-jb,m)(x, v) dvdS(x) = 0.

m=1 i R3

Therefore,

S4 = 0.

Combining estimates (3.31), (3.40), (3.41), (3.42), (3.44), taking summation of (3.16) over ||  2

Estimate on a(t, x): We choose the following test function

(3.46)

The existence and uniqueness of solution to (3.46) is guaranteed by [11, Lamma 4.4.3.1]. When

i = 2 for some i, (3.46) is pure Neumann problem and we need  xixi a dx = i xi a dS(x) = 0 from Corollary 3.3 to ensure the existence of (3.46). Now we compute (3.16). For the second

Since a and c has similar structure, the estimates for Sj(1  j  4) are similar to the case of c(t, x) from (3.18) to (3.28). In fact, similar to the calculation from (3.18) to (3.26), we have that for ||  2,

For S4, we will apply a similar argument as in the estimate of c(t, x) to calculate the boundary value. As before, we decompose  = 3i=1i and calculate the value on each boundary separately:

(v · n(x)f (x), a(x))L2v dS(x).
i

(3.50)

If i = 0 or 2, using boundary value (3.46), we know that xia(x) = 0 on x  i and hence, a(t, x, v) is even with respect to vi. Also, Rx maps v to v - 2v · ejej on i. Thus, on i, we have

a(t, x, Rxv) = a(t, x, v). Therefore, applying change of variable v  Rxv, (3.50) becomes

(v · n(x)f (x), a(x))L2v dS(x)
i

=

Rxv · n(x)f (x, Rxv)a(x, Rxv)) dvdS(x)

i R3

=

-v · n(x)f (x, v)a(x, v) dvdS(x) = 0,

i R3

where we also used (3.3), (3.4), (3.6) and (3.7). If i = 1, by (3.46), one has on i that

a(t, x, Rxv) = -a(t, x, v).

Therefore, applying change of variable v  Rxv and using (3.5) and (3.6), (3.50) becomes

(v · n(x)f (x), a(x))L2v dS(x)
i

=

Rxv · n(x)f (x, Rxv)a(x, Rxv)) dvdS(x)

i R3

=

v · n(x)f (x, v)(-a(x, v)) dvdS(x) = 0.

i R3

In any cases, we have S4 = 0. Combining the above estimates, taking summation over ||  2 of (3.16) and letting  > 0 small enough, we have

THE LANDAU AND NON-CUTOFF BOLTZMANN EQUATION IN UNION OF CUBES

where the summation is taken over 1  ||  2 and we restrict i = 2 for some i when || = 2. Using (3.23), (3.25), (3.35), (3.38) and (3.48), we know that

4. Global existence

In this section, we will prove the main Theorem 1.1.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let ||  2 and apply  to (1.1), we have tf + v · xf - Lf = (f, f ).
Taking inner product of (4.1) with f over  × R3, we have

(4.2)

where we used (2.3) and (2.9) and dS(x) is the spherical measure. By (3.3), (3.4), (3.5) and

(3.7), we know that on interior of each i(1  i  3),

|f (x, Rxv)|2 = |f (x, v)|2, on v · n(x) = 0.

Then by changing of variable v  Rxv, we have

v · n(x)|f (x, v)|2 dvdS(x)
 R3

=

Rxv · n(x)|f (x, Rxv)|2 dvdS(x)

 R3

=

-v · n(x)|f (x, v)|2 dvdS(x) = 0.

Now we take linear combination (4.3) +  × (3.14) with  > 0 small enough and apply (3.52), then

(4.4)

where E(t) is given by

E (t)

:=

Eint(t),

and D(t) is defined by (1.7). It's direct to check that E(t) satisfies (1.6) with  > 0 sufficiently

small. With the main estimate (4.4) in hand, it is now standard to apply the continuity argument

and local existence from Section 5 to prove the global-in-time existence and uniqueness of (1.1)

and (1.2), under the smallness of (1.12).

For large-time decay, when  + 2s  0, we have E(t) D(t). Then under the smallness (1.12)

of E(0), it's standard to apply the a priori estimate argument to obtain

tE(t) + E(t)  0,

and

E(t)  e-t

for some generic constant  > 0. This gives the large-time behavior for hard potential.

For soft potential, we will make use of additional velocity weight and calculate the weighted

estimates first. Taking inner product of (4.1) with w2f over  × R3 and summation over

||  2, we have from Lemma 2.1 and 2.2 that

tEw(t) + Dw(t) ( E(t) + E(t))D(t) + Ew(t)Dw(t),

where Ew is given by

tEw(t) + Dw(t)  0.

f (0, x, v) = f0(x, v),
f (t, x, v) = f (t, x, Rxv), on -,

(5.2)

for a given function h = h(t, x, v), where A and K and defined by (2.5) for Landau case and (2.7) for Boltzmann case. Then we have the following Lemma on existence of linear equation (5.2).

Lemma 5.2. There exists 0 > 0, T0 > 0 such if wf0  Hx2L2v, wh  L T0 L2x,v  L2T0 Hx2L2D,

Proof. Let v and x be the standard mollifier in R3 and : v, x  Cc, 0  v, x  1, vdv = xdx = 1. For  > 0, let v(v) = -3v(-1v) and x(x) = -3x(-1x). We mollify

We first consider the case q = 0 in (1.4). In order to obtain the solution, we consider the following vanishing problem:

Then we denote (5.6) by

(5.6)

(tf, g)L2x,v + B[f, g] = (Kh, g)L2x,v , where B[f, g] is a bilinear operator on H × H with
H = {f  L2x,v : v 2f  L2x,v,  || + ||  2, f (t, x, v) = f (t, x, Rxv) on -}, equipped with norm ||+||2 v 2f . L2xL2v Note that for f  H,

with initial data f (0, x, v) = f0(x, v). Since || = 1, we assume i = 1 for some i = 1, 2, 3. Then we use Hilbert space

H = f  L2x,v : v 2f  Hx2L2v, f  L2xL2D, f (t, x, v) = -f (t, x, Rxv) on i if i = 1,

f (t, x, v) = f (t, x, Rxv) on j if j = 0 or 2 .

Using the same argument we used to derive (5.9), there exists f ,  H such that

Then f  = f in the weak sense by using (5.11) and (5.14). Also, one can use (5.2)1 to define

nf on the boundary and deduce (5.4) as in Lemma 3.1.

For second order derivatives, we let || = 2 and consider equation

tf  + v · xf  - Af =

(- h,  f ) + (h, f ) + Kh,

(5.15)

in space H. Applying the same argument for deriving (5.12) and (5.13), we can obtain the solution f   H to (5.15) with estimate

Then f  = f and f satisfies (5.5). Combining estimates (5.10), (5.13) and (5.16), we obtain

(5.5). This completes the Lemma when q = 0. For the estimate with weight, we let g = w2f in (5.6) and use Lemma 2.1 and 2.2 to obtain

This is an analog estimate as (5.8).

The term CT

can be absorbed by the left hand

side if we choose T > 0 sufficiently small. Then one can follow the same argument from (5.9) to

(5.16) to obtain the result (5.5) for weighted estimates. This completes Lemma 5.2.

Proof of Theorem 5.1. We now construct the approximation solution sequence {f n(t, x, v)} n=0 using the following iterative scheme:

tf n+1 + v · xf n+1 - Af n+1 = ±(f n, f n+1) + Kf n, f n+1(0, x, v) = f0(x, v), f n+1(t, x, v) = f n+1(t, x, Rxv) on v · n(x) < 0,

for n = 0, 1, 2, · · · , where we set f 0(t, x, v) = f0(x, v). With Lemma 5.2, it is a standard procedure to apply the induction argument to show that there exists 0 > 0 and T0 > 0 such that if

then the approximate solution sequence {f n} is well-defined satisfying

where T0 is chosen to be small enough. Notice that f n+1 - f n solves

t(f n+1 - f n) + v · x(f n+1 - f n) - A(f n+1 - f n) = (f n, f n+1 - f n) + (f n - f n-1, f n) + K(f n - f n-1),

in the weak sense, for n = 1, 2, 3, · · · . Using the method for deriving (5.5), we know that {f n+1-f n} is Cauchy sequence with respect to norms f n+1-f n + L T0Hx2L2v f n+1-f n . L2T0 Hx2L2D Then the limit function f (t, x, v) is indeed a unique solution to (1.1) and (1.2) satisfying estimate
(5.1). For the positivity, we can use the argument from [12, Lemma 8, page 416] for Landau case
and [10, Page 833] for Boltzmann case; the details are omitted for brevity. The proof of Theorem
5.1 is completed.
