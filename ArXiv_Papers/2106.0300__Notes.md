## Abstract

Throughput-Outage scaling laws for single-hop cache-aided device-to-device (D2D) communications have been extensively investigated under the assumption of the protocol model. However, the corresponding performance under physical models has not been explored; in particular it remains unclear whether link-level power control and scheduling can improve the asymptotic performance. This paper thus investigates the throughput-outage scaling laws of cache-aided single-hop D2D networks considering a general physical channel model. By considering the networks with and without the equal-throughput assumption, we analyze the corresponding outer bounds and provide the achievable performance analysis. Results show that when the equal-throughput assumption is considered, using link-level power control and scheduling cannot improve the scaling laws. On the other hand, when the equal-throughput assumption is not considered, we show that the proposed double time-slot framework with appropriate link-level power control and scheduling can significantly improve the throughput-outage scaling laws, where the fundamental concept is to first distinguish links according to their communication distances, and then enhance the throughput for links with small communication distances.
