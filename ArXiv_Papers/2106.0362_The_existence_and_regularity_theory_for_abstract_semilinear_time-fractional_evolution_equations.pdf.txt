Abstract
In this paper, we investigate the abstract time-fractional evolution equations with Lipschitz perturbations. We prove that the exsictence time of the solution is independent of the Lipschitz constant. We also study the perturbation problems with initial data given by integral formula. This is applied to prove the time differentiability of the solution. The differentiability is essential to use maximum principle when we investigate the quantitative evaluation. Furthermore, we step into the general result for the locally Lipschitz perturbation problems. We guarantee the parallel result to the usual evolution equation theory, the blow up alternative holds. The theory on general Banach spaces enables us to deduce space regularity result easily.

1 Introduction

In this paper, we study the following abstract time-fractional Cauchy problem

Dt(u - u0)(t) + Au(t) + B(t, u(t)) = f (t) in (0, T ],

(1)

u(0) = u0

in the real Banach space X. The perturbation B satisfies

B(t, u) - B(t, v)  L u - v forall u, v  X, t  0

(2)

for some Lipschitz constant L > 0. The operator Dt is the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative of order   (0, 1)

defined by

Dt(u)(t)

:=

1 (1 -

)

d dt

t
(t -  )-u( )d,
0

(3)

and A : D(A)  X is the generator of some analytic semigroup. The time-fractional partial differential equation of the form

Dt(u - u0)(t) + Au(t) = f (t) in (0, T ],

(4)

u(0) = u0

was originally proposed in order to model so-called anomalous diffusion phenomenon, which is different from the usual diffusion of materials based on Brownian motion[19], [3].
There are many studies on the time-fractional Cauchy problem (4). In [14], J.Mu, B.Ahmad, S.Huang investigated the theory of existence and regularity of solutions when the external force term f has the time regularity of f  F r,((0, T ]; X), where F r,((0, T ]; X) is called weighted Ho¨lder continuous space. Luchko [21] established the maximum principle theory and deduced the uniqueness of the time-fractional evolution equations. Guidetti [7],[8] investigated the maximal regularity theory for (4) in an abstract framework.
It is natural to have a curiosity to the perturbation evolution equation (1). In abstract framework, Akagi [11] showed the solvavility of (1) when X is a Hilbert space and the A is replaced by subdifferential  for some functional . Y.Zhou, F.Jiao [22] proved the existence of local mild solution with nonlocal initial conditions, while they imposed some restrictions to the growth of the perturbations in order to use Banach fixed-point theorem.
There are also some studies on specific models. M.Inc, A.Yusuf, A.I.Aliyu, D.Baleanu [17] investigated the one dimensional time-fractional Allen-Cahn equation and Klein-Gordon equation. H.Liu, A.Cheng, H.Wangb, J. Zhao

[12] studied numerical analysis of time-fractional Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard phase-field models. These models discribe the phase separation process of iron alloys. Zhang, Quanguo; Li, Yaning; Su, Menglong[23] investigated time-fractional Ginzburg-Landau equation which is used in the superconductivity theory.
By the way, it is also important for some singular perturbation problems that T is independence of the Lipschitz constant. Approximation equations with singular perturbation enables us to consider a problem with some singularities. For example, in [18], they considered the equation which describes the heterogeneous chemical catalyst with the absorption term B(u) = u-u>0 by introducing the singular perturbation which approximates the original perturbation. In their discussion, it is essential the existence and uniqueness of solution for approximation equations. Moreover, in the Stefan problem, the free boundary problem where we consider heat equation in the moving domain, the strategy so-colled penalty method is often used to construct the solution. This method also introduce the approximation equations to gain the original solution. For the detail, we refer [10],[9]. Nowadays there are some studies on Stefan problems which consider the time-fractional heat equations instead of usual one in the moving domains, such as [16],[20].
While the above examples tell us that the general theory for the perturbation problem (1) is essential to some applications, not enough one have been established. The novelty of this paper is the establishment of the existence theory independent of the Lipschitz constant L which enables us construct the solution in arbitrary interval. Moreover, we construct the theory in general Banach space. This provides us the space regularity by choosing appropriate spaces. Furthermore, we deduce the time differentiability of the solution when f and B are sufficiently regular. This result allows us to use maximum principle shown by [21] when we investigate quantitative properties of the solution. We study further the locally Lipschitz perturbation problems which has many applications.
The outline of this paper is as follows. In section2, we introduce some notations, function spaces and some preliminary results which shall be used later. In section3, 4, we prove the main existence theorem. In section3, we establish the theorem in the framework of Ho¨lder continuous spaces. In section4, we mention that the same argument holds in the weighted Ho¨lder spaces. The outline of the proof is as follows. At first, we show that there exists the unique mild solution no matter how large the T and L is. The mild solution essencially becomes the usual one for (1) because of the existence theorem given by [14]. The regularity property shall be established by using the theory of [8]. In section5, we investigate the problem with initial data given by integral formula. The outline of the proof is completely similar to the previous section, while the mild solution formula is slightly different. In section6, we prove the time differentiability of the solution when f and B have appropriate regularities. The time differentiability is essential to use maximum principle due to [21]. In section7, we step into the general theory of locally Lipschitz perturbation problems. In the usual evolution equation theory, the property so-called blow up alternative holds for the equations equipped with locally Lipschitz perturbations. We verify the same result as usual must holds. In section8, we apply our results to specific model. We investigate the combustion model with the perturbation part B(u) = e-1/u. This is treated by Ikeda, Mimura [15] to describe the reaction-diffusion processes with the generation of heats, so the time-fractional diffusion model must be important to consider some complicated physical phenomena. The perturbation item comes from the Arrhenius law to states the dependence of reaction rates on absolute temperature u.

2 preliminaries

2.1 Notations

We prepare some notations and function spaces which we shall use later. We shall use some special functions such

as Gamma function denoted by



(z) :=

tz-1e-tdt z > 0,

(5)

0

and Beta function denoted by

1

B(x, y) := (1 - t)x-1ty-1dt x, y > 0.

(6)

0

These functions satisfies the following properties (see for instance [13]);

(i) (1 + x) = x(x) x > 0,

(ii)

B(x, y)

=

(x)(y) (x + y)

,

(iii) 1 = 1

e-xd (Hankel's formula)

(x) 2i CH

where CH is an Hankel contour;

CH = C+  C-  C0,

C+ :  = ,  : -  0,

C- :  = -,  : 0  -, C0 : ei, -/2    /2.

We also introduce the Mittag-Leffler function for 0  t < 

Eµ, (t) :=



tn (µ + n)

(7)

n=0

which is evaluated as follows (see [5]).

Lemma 1.

where 0 = min0<< ().

Let X be a Banach space equipped with the norm · . The liner operator A : X  D(A)  X is called sectorial, if it satisfies the following conditions,

(A)   = {  C; | arg | < } for some 0 <  < /2

(9)

( - A)-1

B(X) 

M ||

 /  for some M > 0.

(10)

where (A) is the spectrum set of A. The former condition implies that the resolvent set of A contains 0, that is, A-1  B(X). More presicely, for  < A-1 -1, {  C; ||  }  (A). We do not assume the density of D(A) in order to enable us to apply the theory to wide variety of function spaces to gain some space regularity. We can define the fractional power of sectrial operator, which we shall organize in Appendix.
Owing to [22], the solution of (4) necessarily satisfies the following representation formula, which is the main tool to deduce some properties of the solution.

and T (t) denotes the semigroup generated by A which satisfies the following estimates;

T (t) B(X)  C1e-C2t  C1 t  0, AT (t) B(X)  Ct- t > 0,  > 0.

2.2 Function spaces

We employ the following weighted Ho¨lder continuous function space.

Definition 1. For indices 0 <  < r < 1, let F r,((0, T ]; X) denotes the function space of all continuous functions f on (0, T ] with the following properties:

1. limt0 t1-rf (t) exists. 2. f is  Ho¨lder continuous with the weight s1-r+, that is,

sup
0s<tT

s1-r+ f (t) - (t - s)

f (s)

< .

3. the following holds,

lim
t0

wf

=

lim sup
t0 0s<t

s1-r+ f (t) - f (s) (t - s)

= 0.

This function space become Banach space with the norm;

f

= F r, sup t1-r
0tT

f (t)

+

sup
0s<tT

s1-r+ f (t) - (t - s)

f (s)

.

If there is no danger of confusion, we shall write F r, instead of F r,((0, T ]; X). It is obvious that the embedding F r,  F r, holds for 0 <  <  < r  1 . When g  C([0, T ]; X) satisfying g(0) = 0, f (t) = tr-1g(t) belongs to
F r,((0, T ]; X). Also, for 0 <  < r = 1, f  C belongs to F 1,. We refer to [5] in detail.

2.3 Some results on the existence and regularity
We shall employ the following result due to [14] when we conclude the mild solution of (1) necessarily be the usual one. Note that the theorem guarantees the existence of solution (4) when f  C, as mentioned after Definition1. Theorem 1. Suppose that f  F r, and u0  D(Ar).Then, for all 0 < max(, 1 - ) < r  1 and 0 <  <  < 1, (4) has unique solution u  C([0, T ]; X)  C((0, T ]; D(A)) such that Dtu, Au  F r,.
We use the maximal regularity result due to [8], [6].
Theorem 2. For   (0, 1), the following conditions are necessary and sufficient, in order that there exists a unique strict solution u such that Dt, Au are bounded with values in (X, D(A)),;
1. f  C([0, T ]; X)  B([0, T ]; (X, D(A)),),
2. u0  D(A), Au0  (X, D(A)),.
Theorem 3. For   (0, ), the following conditions are necessary and sufficient, in order that there exists a unique strict solution u such that Dt, Au belong to C([0, T ]; X);
1. f  C([0, T ]; X),
2. u0  D(A), Au0 + f (0)  (X, D(A))/,. When we observe the quantitative property, the next statement is essential (see, [21], [16]). Theorem 4. Let a function g  C([0, T ])  C1((0, T ]) satisfies g  L1(0, T ) and attains its maximum over the interval [0, T ] at t0  (0, T ], then, for all 0 <  < 1,
t0
(t0 -  )-g( )d  0.
0
Moreover, if g is not constant on [0, t0], then
t0
(t0 -  )-g( )d > 0.
0
4

We note that if g is differentiable, then

Dt(g

-

g(0))(t)

=

1 (1 -

)

d dt

t
(t -  )-(g( ) - g(0))d
0

=

1 (1 - )

t
(t -  )-g( )d
0

where the last term is so-called Caputo derivative. Therefore, we can use Theorem 4 to (1), or just (4) if we confirm the solution is time differentiable.

2.4 Characterization of time-fractional derivative by fractional power of operator

In this section, we introduce a formalization of the time-fractional derivative in an abstract framework due to [7],[8]. Let an operator B be as follows;

B : {v  C1([0, T ]; X) : v(0) = 0}  C([0, T ]; X),



Bv

=

-

dv dt

.

(15)

For 0 <  < 1, the power of the operator B is as follow;

B-

=

1 2i

-( - B)-1d.


(16)

where we take the path  as in the Appendix. We can confirm that the formula coincides with,

(B-f )(t)

=

1 ()

t
(t -  )-1f ( )d.
0

(17)

In the abstract point of view, the inverse of (16) B := (B-)-1 is the  power of B. And the domain of B is the range of B-, that is, D(B) = R(B-). On the other hand, we can check the formula (17) is inverse mapping of Dt. This implies that Dt and B is the same operator. These properties are mentioned in [7],[8].

Proposition 1. The operator B defined (15) is sectrial in C([0, T ]; X), and its fractional power is given by (17).

Proof. For all   C and f  C([0, T ]; X),

v

= ( - B)-1f



dv dt

+ v = f,

v(0) = 0

t
 v(t) = e-(t-s)f (s)ds

0

Therefore, the power of B must be calculated as follow;

(B-f )(t)

=

1 2i

=

1 2i

So, It is sufficient to show that for all b > 0,

-

0

t

-e-(t-s)d .

holds. This formula is obtained by the Hankel's formula, and transform the path  to CH . The resolvent estimate (10) shall be obtained easly;

The next result is due to [7],[8],

Proposition 2. Let B be as in (15). Then,

(C([0, T ]; X), D(B)), = {f  C([0, T ]; X) : f (0) = 0}

(18)

satisfies with the equivalent norms.

Proposition 12 deduces the inclusion for  > ,

{f  C([0, T ]; X); f (0) = 0}  D(B)  C([0, T ]; X).

(19)

Especially, C function with initial condition 0, must be  differentiable. Also, if  diffirentiable function u  C([0, T ]; X) satisfies Dtu  C([0, T ]; X), then, u is in C([0, T ]; X).
Remark 1. Let Y = Lp(0, T ), D(B) = W 1,p(0, T ), then we get

D(B)  (Lp(0, T ), W 1,p(0, T )), = B,p,(0, T )

where we define Besov space as follow;

Bs,p,q := (Lp, W m,p)s/m,q.

For any bounded   RN with sufficiently smooth boundary, we employ the following inclusion (see, [4]),

sp > N  Bs,p,q()  C().

When N = 1, m = 1, this embedding holds if  > 1/p. Therefore, in the Lebesgue and Sobolev space perspective,  > 1/p diffirentiable function naturally become continuous. This fact has already been mentioned in [11] when p = 2 and X is Hilbert space.

2.5 Integral inequality

Suppose that (t, s) is real valued function defined for 0  s < t  T satisfying

0  (t, s)  C(t - s)-1

(20)

for some  > 0 and C > 0. We introduce the following integral inequality due to [5].

Theorem 5. Let a, b, µ,  > 0 be constant. If  satisfies

t

(t, s)  a(t - s)µ-1 + b (t -  )-1(, s)d, 0  s < t  T,

(21)

s

then, the following evaluation holds,

(t, s)  a(µ)(t - s)µ-1Eµ, (b())1/ (t - s) , 0  s < t  T.

(22)

Suppose that w(t) is real valued function for 0 < t  T satisfying

0  w(t)  Ct-1

(23)

for some , C > 0. Replacement of (t, s) = w(t - s) yields the next corollary.

Corollary 1. We make the same assumptions as in Theorem5. If w meets

t

w(t)  atµ-1 + b (t -  )-1w( )d,

(24)

0

then, w satisfies

w(t)  a(µ)tµ-1Eµ, (b())1/ t .

(25)

3 Main result and its proof

where

Obviously the norms · X and · C are equivalent, i.e., (X , · X ) is complete. We define the map S : X  X by

S : v  u(t) =

h()T (t)du0 +

(t -  )-1h()T ((t -  )-1) [f ( ) - B(v( ))] d d.

Our aim is to prove that we can choose appropriate µ > 0 such that S becomes contraction mapping. We shall denote inequalities with some constant by .

Lemma 2. Suppose that u0  D(Aq), g  C([0, T ]; X), 0 <    and -1  q  1. Then,

Theorem 6. There exist appropriate 0 <  <  such that for all L > 0, T > 0, we can choose sufficiently large µ > 0 so that the S becomes contraction mapping. Proof. For arbitrary v1, v2  X , let u1 = Sv1, u2 = Sv2. We shall show the estimate such that
Sv1 - Sv2 X  PµC(L, T ) u1 - u2 X where C(L, T ) denotes the appropriate constant depends on L and T , and Pµ  0, µ  .

From the above, we can select sufficiently large µ such that S become contraction mapping for arbitrary L > 0 and T > 0. This completes the proof.
Corollary 2. There exists appropriate 0 <  <  such that for all T > 0, f  C([0, T ]; X), u0  D(Aq), and -1  q  1, the perturbation problem (1) has the unique solution.

Proof. Let u~ denotes the fixed-point of S. The existence and uniquness for the equation with external force term f - B(u~)  C;
Dtw + Aw = f - B(u~), w(0) = u0
is assured by Theorem1. This solution w coincides with u~ because the representation formula of (11) necessarily be satisfied.

We can improve the time regularity of (1) via Theorem3 and 19
Proposition 3. Let f is  Ho¨lder continuous and let  = min(, ), where  is index as in the Corollary2. If u0  D(A), Au0 + f (0) - B(u0)  (X, D(A))/,, then, Dt, Au must be  Ho¨lder continuous. Moreover, u is in C([0, T ]; X).
Proof. The former statement is obvious from Theorem3. Moreover, this result means that u, Dtu  C([0, T ]; X). We deduce the conclusion by using the inclusion (19).

Remark 2. Our results shall be extended to the non local perturbation

B : C([0, T ]; X)  C([0, T ]; X)

such that

B(u) - B(v) C([0,T ];X)  L u - v C([0,T ];X)

for some L > 0 provided that the range of B is involved in some Ho¨lder continuous space so that the fixed point returns to the solution.

We can conclude similar result to the Theorem6 for weighted Ho¨lder space F r,. As in the proof above, we set the
functional space Y by Y = {u  F r,((0, T ]; X); u Y < },

where

u Y = sup e-µtt1-r
0tT

f (t)

+ sup
0s<tT

s1-r+e-µt f (t) - f (s) (t - s)

.

h()T (t)u0 + d

By the slightly changed strategy, we can prove the following result.

Theorem 7. There exists appropriate 0 < , r < 1, 0 <  <  < 1 such that forall L > 0, T > 0, we can choose sufficiently large µ > 0 so that the S~ becomes contraction mapping. Proof. We only have to adjust the weight t1-r and s1-r+. For arbitrary v1, v2  Y, let u1 = S~v1, u2 = S~v2. We shall show the estimate such that
Sv1 - Sv2 Y  QµC(L, T ) u1 - u2 Y
where C(L, T ) denotes the appropriate constant depends on L and T , and Qµ  0, µ  .

5 Initial condition with integral formula

In this section, we investigate the following equation

Dtu + Au = f, in (0, T ], (I-1u)(0) = x0

(27)

where

I -1 u(t)

=

1 (1 -

)

t
(t -  )-u( )d.
0

(28)

We assume that f  F r,((0, T ]; X) for some 0 <  < r  1. The representation formula for mild solution shall be

changed from (11).

Proposition 4. The solution of (27) is given by the following;



t

u(t) =  h()T (t)x0dt-1 + 

h()(t -  )-1T ((t -  ))f ( )d d

(29)

0

00

Proof. The formula (29) can be deduced from (28) by the same way as in [22]. In fact, we apply the Laplace transform to (28) and use the fact(see, for instance [13]),

L [Dtg] (s) = sL[g](s) - I-1g(0)

where L is Laplace transform

L[g](s) :=

Therefore, we denote U = L[u], F = L[f ], then,


e-stg(t)dt.
0

sU (s) - x0 + AU (s) = F (s)  U (s) = -(-s - A)-1(x0 + F (s)).

We use the fact that for each   0, Then,


( - A)-1 = - etT (t)dt,
0



U (s) =

est(x0 + F (s))dt.

0

14

The rest of the calculations are the same as in [22]. The second term is obviously the solution for

Dtw + Aw = f, w(0) = 0.

We denote the first term by w0(t) and let



(t) =

h()T (t)x0d.

0

We observe that is,



w0(t) =

h()A-1(t-1)AT (t)x0d

On the other hands, (11) means that (t) is the solution for

In the investigation for the Lipschitz perturbation problem

Dtu + Au + B(u) = f, in (0, T ], (Iu)(0) = x0,

(30)

it sufficies to use the fixed point theorem for the map



t

v  u(t) =  h()T (t)x0dt-1 + 

h()(t -  )-1T ((t -  ))(f ( ) - B(v( )))d d.

The essential discussion is the estimate to

t

u1(t) - u2(t) = 

h()(t -  )-1T ((t -  ))(B(v1( )) - B(v2( )))d d

00

for given u1, u2. Hence the completely same strategy of the proof of Theorem6 deduces the next result.

Theorem 8. Let f  F r,((0, T ]; X) such that r,  satisfies as in the Theorem1, 7 and x0  D(A). Then, (30) has the unique solution.

6 Time differentiability of the solution

Theorem 9. Let f  C([0, T ]; X)  C1((0, T ]; X) and f   F r,((0, T ]; X) for some , r,  satisfing the conditions as in Theorem2, 8. Also assume that Au0, B(u0), f (0)  D(A), B : X  X is Fr´echet differentiable, its derivative B : X  B(X) is uniformly bounded, that is, there exists L > 0 such that B(u) B(X)  L for all u  X, and B is also Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant L. Then, the solution of the problem (1) is time differentiable in (0, T ].

Proof. For given u  C([0, T ]; X), let us consider the solution for

Dtw + Aw + B(u)w = f , in (0, T ], (Iw)(0) = x0,

(31)

also, let
t
U (t) = w( )d + u0.
0
Theorem 8 guarantees the well-definedness of u  U . We shall use the Banach fixed point theorem for the map C([0, T ]; X)  u  U  C([0, T ]; X). We equip the norm

| u | := sup e-µt u(t)
0tT

to C([0, T ]; X). The representation (29) and the assumption f   F r, gives the estimate

w(t)  C C

t
t-1 + t+r-1 + (t -  )-1 w( ) d
0 t
t-1 + (t -  )-1 w( ) d
0

for some constant C depends on the semigroup, existence time T > 0, f  and L. Therefore, Corollary1 yields

w(t) t-1(1 + bt)2-ebt+1 t-1.

where b = (C())1/. For given u1, u2,

t

w1(t) - w2(t) =

h()(t -  )-1T ((t -  )) (B(u1( ))w1( ) - B(u2( ))w2( )) d d

t

e-µt w1(t) - w2(t) t2-1| u1 - u2 | + (t -  )-1e-µ w1( ) - w2( ) d

16

Therefore, we use again Corollary1 for e-µt w1(t) - w2(t) to obtain

w1(t) - w2(t) eµtt2-1(1 + bt)2-2| u1 - u2 |

for appropriate b > 0. Hence,

U1(t) - U2(t) e-µt U1(t) - U2(t)

t
eµ  2-1 (1 + b )2-2 d | u1 - u2 |
0
t
e-µ(t- ) 2-1 (1 + b )2-2 d | u1 - u2 |
0

For small  > 0, we set p = 1 +  and its conjugate q. Since (1 + bt)2-2  (1 + bT )2-2,

e-µt U1(t) - U2(t) We choose  > 0 such that

(2 - 1)p + 1 = (2 - 1)(1 + ) + 1 = 2 + (2 - 1) > 0.

So we can take sufficiently large µ so that u  U becomes contraction mapping. Then, the fixed point u meets the following properties;

 

1

(t -  )-u( )d + Au(t) + B(u(t))u(t) = f (t),

0

Integrating both sides, we deduce

1 (1 - )

t
(t -  )-u( )d - x0 + A(u(t) - u0) + B(u(t)) - B(u0) = f (t) - f (0).
0

If we choose

x0 = -Au0 - B(u0) + f (0),

u coincides with the unique solution of

Dtu + Au + B(u) = f, u(0) = u0.

This completes the proof.

7 Locally Lipschitz perturbation

In this section, we investigate the locally Lipschitz perturbation problem, where B is locally Lipschitz continuous on X in the sense that

B(t, u) - B(t, v)  L() u - v u, v  {w  X; w  }

(32)

where L : R  R is weakly increasing function, and for each u  X, t  B(t, v) is bounded. For the discussion on the extension of the solution, we refer to [23].
Theorem 10. Suppose that B satisfies (32). Then, (1) has the unique local solution. Furthermore, suppose that T  > 0 be its maximal existece time. Then, the solution satisfies the either one of the following;

17

1. T  = .

2. T  <  and lim u(t) = .
tT 
Proof. We begin with the construction of local solution. Let

B(t, u)

B~(t, u) =  B 

t,

M u

u

if u  M, if u > M.

We can easily see that B~ is globally Lipschitz continuous. Therefore, there exists unique solution u for

Dt(u - u0) + Au + B~(u) = f, u(0) = u0.

We take sufficiently large M such that u0 < M/2, then, the continuity of u guarantees the existence of T > 0 such that
u(t) < M t  [0, T ].

It means that u satisfies (1) on [0, T ]. We assume T  <  and C := lim inftT  u(t) < . Then, for any 0 <  < 1, there exists t  (T  - , T )
such that u(t)  C +  < C + 1. We set

Eh, := {v  C ([t, t + h]; X); v(t) = u(t) , v - u(t) C([tt+h];X)  }, · = Eh, · C ([t,t+h];X)

and for each v  Eh,, t  [t, t + h],

T (v)(t) :=


h()T (t)u0d +

t 
(t -  )-1h()T ((t -  )) [f ( ) - B(u( ))] d d
00
t
(t -  )-1h()T ((t -  )) [f ( ) - B(v( ))] d d.
t 0

For any v  Eh,, the representation of mild solution povides T (v)(t) = u(t) and

T (v)(t) - u(t) = T (v)(t) - T (v)(t)



=

h() [T (t) - T (t )] u0d

As in the proof of Lemma2 and Theorem6, we estimate T (v)(t) - u(t) (t - t) . This inequality yields the existence of ~h > 0 such that if h < h~, then T (v)(t) - u(t)  , i.e., T maps Eh, to itself. We note that we can choose h~ independently of . For arbitrary v1, v2  Eh,, B(v1(t)) - B(v2(t))  L(u(t) + ) v1(t) - v2(t) . We write in abbreviated form of L(u(t) + )  L(C + 1 + ) =: L.

Remark 3. Since the elements F r, are essentially regarded as the Ho¨lder continuous functions except for the origin, the same proof provides the blow up alternative in the weighted Ho¨lder space framework. Also, we can state the similar result for the integral initial conition problem (30).

8 Application

Let us consider the following combustion equation

Dt(u - u0) - u - e-1/u{u>0} = f (t).

(33)

This model describes some reaction-diffusion processes with the generation of heats, based on the Arrhenius law

which states the reaction rates is proportional to e-C/u for some C > 0, where u represents the absolute temperature

[15]. The perturbation part

r  e-1/r if r > 0,

0

if r  0

is obviously Lipschitz, so we apply Corollary 2 and Proposition3 with the following framework;

X = u  C(),









D(A) = u  W 2,p(); u, u  C(), u= 0 .

(34)

 p1



where  is bounded and its boundary is sufficiently smooth. It is known that the interpolation property

(X, D(A)), = {u  C2(); u= 0}

(35)

is satisfied [2]. Therefore, combining the results of Theorem2, Corollary2, Proposition3, and Theorem9, we get the following statement for (33).

Theorem 11. Let T > 0 be arbitrary and f  C([0, T ]; C()) for some 0 <  < 1. Then, there exists the sufficiently small 0 <  <  such that for all u0  D(Aq) with -1  q  1, the Dirichlet problem

Dt(u(·, x) - u0(x))(t) - u(t, x) - e-1/u{u(t,x)>0} = f (t, x), (t, x)  (0, T ] × ,



u(t, x) = 0

(t, x)  [0, T ] × ,

(36)

 

u(t, 0) = u0(x) x  

has the unique solution

u  C([0, T ]; C())  C((0, T ]; D(A)).

Furthermore, if

u0  D(A), -u0 + f (0) + e-1/u0 {u0>0}  {w  C/(); w= 0}

where  = min(, ), then,

Dtu, -u  C([0, T ]; C()), u  C([0, T ]; C()). If f is differentiable with respect to t and its derivative is of class F r,((0, T ]; C() for appropriate r,  as in Theorem9, then u is time differentiable.
Theorem 12 enable us to estimate the D(Aq) from below and above, that is, for all  > q,

{u  C2(); u= 0}  D(Aq)  {u  C2q(); u= 0}.

Theorem 4 provides further properties to (33).

Proposition 5. Assume f  0, u0  0. Then, u  0. Proof. The selection of Banach space (34) yields the twice space differentiability. If the solution u attain its minimum at (t0, x0)  (0, T ] ×  and u(t0, x0) < 0, then Theorem 4 provides
0 > Dt(u(·, x0) - u0(x0)) - u(t0, x0) = f (t0, x0),
it is nothing but the contradiction.

A Power of operator

We provide the overview of the fractional power of operator. See [1], [2], [5] for details. Let A be sectrial, then we

define its power for z > 0 by

A-z

:=

1 2i

-z( - A)-1d,


(37)

where we take the branch

-z = exp[-z(log || + i arg )],

that is, single-valued function on C \ (-, 0]. Also, we take the integral path  = -  +  0, where

± :  = e±i,    < , 0 :  = ei, -    ,

for  < A-1 -1. The evaluation

|-z| = | exp -z(log  ± i)| = e±(z)-z,   ±

guarantees that the definition of A-z makes sence. When z = n  N, we transform the path into || =  so that we

confirm

1 2i

-n( - A)-1d
C

=

-

(n

1 -

1)!

dn-1 dn-1

(

-

A)-1

=0

= (-1)n[( - A)-n]=0

= A-n.

where we retake the path C = {  C; || = }. For all z, z > 0, we can show the semigroup porperty

A-z A-z = A-(z+z)

by the standard way. We define An as the inverse of A-n. Let z  R is not integer. If A-zu = 0, then for any n > z,
A-nu = A-(n-z)A-z u = 0
Therefore u = 0. This means that A-z has inverse. So we define Az = (A-z)-1, D(Az) = R(A-z). We can show R(A-z2 )  R(A-z1 ), i.e., D(Az2 )  D(Az1 ) since 0 < z1 < z2 implies A-z2 = A-z1 A-(z2-z1).
We list the important properties for power of operator theory. We refer to [5], [1], [2] for the detailed proof.
Theorem 12. Let A be a sectrial operator on Banach space X. For 0 <  <  < 1, the following inclusion holds.

(X, D(A)),  (X, D(A)),1  D(A)  (X, D(A)),

Theorem 13. Let  < /2. Then, for any 0 < t <  and 0 <  < ,

holds.

Proof. Let where

e-t( - A)-1d


± :  = e±i, 0   <  0 :  = ei, -    .

We can easly check A-E(t) = E(t)A- = T (t), i.e.,

AT (t)

=

1 2i

e-t( - A)-1d,


which yields
