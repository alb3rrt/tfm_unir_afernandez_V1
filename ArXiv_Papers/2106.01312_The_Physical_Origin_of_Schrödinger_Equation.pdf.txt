Quantum mechanics is one of the basic theories of modern physics. Here, the famous Schr¨odinger equation and the differential operators representing mechanical quantities in quantum mechanics are derived, just based on the principle that the translation invariance (symmetry) of a system in Hamiltonian mechanics should be preserved in quantum mechanics. Moreover, according to the form of the differential operators, the commutation relation in quantum mechanics between the generalized coordinate and the generalized momentum can be directly obtained. We believe that the results in this paper are very useful for understanding the physical origin of quantum mechanics.

I. INTRODUCTION

After about one century of development, quantum mechanics has become a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology and quantum information science. Nevertheless, as a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics, the Schr¨odinger equation is given as a hypothesis in any quantum mechanics textbook, as well as the differential operators representing physical quantities. Many people believe that these basic concepts in quantum mechanics cannot be derived. In fact, they are closely related to the translation invariance (symmetry) in Hamiltonian mechanics where the equations of motion of a system are given as

q

=



H ,

p

p

=

-

H q

.

(1)

Here, q and p are respectively the generalized coordinate and generalized momentum of the system (for simplicity, we assume that the system has only one generalized coordinate q and the corresponding generalized momentum p), and H(q, p, t) is the Hamiltonian function of the system. In Hamiltonian mechanics, the conserved quantities in a system are closely related to the translation invariance of the system. For instance, the generalized momentum p in Eq. (1) will be a constant if the Hamiltonian H(q, p, t) is invariant under the translation transformation with respect to the generalized coordinate q.
In the 1920s, quantum mechanics was founded by Schr¨odinger [1], Heisenberg [2], Born [3, 4] and others based on some hypotheses including the hypothesis of wave-particle duality proposed by de Broglie [5]. Waveparticle duality is the concept in quantum mechanics that all particles exhibit a wave nature and vice versa. It means that every particle or quantum entity may be de-

scribed as either a particle or a wave, and that the classical concepts "particle" or "wave" cannot fully describe the behavior of quantum-scale objects. Actually, any matter will not disappear in space and time, will only be converted from one form into another. Both "particle" and "wave" are the forms of matter. In 1927, the hypothesis of de Broglie wave was first conformed in DavissonGermer experiment [6] which was an experimental milestone in the development of quantum mechanics.
Since the establishment of quantum wave mechanics in 1926, many noteworthy attempts have been made to derive the Schr¨odinger equation from different principles [7­19]. Such as, in Ref. [7] the author derived the Schr¨odinger equation with the hypothesis that every particle of mass m is subject to a Brownian motion with a diffusion coefficient and no friction. In Ref. [8], the Schr¨odinger equation is derived from the dynamical postulate of Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics and the Hamilton­Jacobi equation of classical mechanics. In Ref. [9], the author derived the Schr¨odinger equation based on the exact uncertainty principle. It should be pointed out that no matter what method is used to derive the Schr¨odinger equation, the hypothesis that introduces Planck's constant into quantum mechanics is essential.
Here, we give a novel, concise and heuristic way to give the Schr¨odinger equation just based on wave-particle duality and the translational symmetries (space and time translation invariance) of the system. We will see that it is the symmetry that builds a bridge from Hamiltonian mechanics to quantum mechanics. The material presented in this paper is of particular interest to university teachers of quantum mechanics courses and their students, at both undergraduate and graduate level. Researchers and educationalists on quantum mechanics, at all levels, may also benefit from a reading of the paper.
II. DIFFERENTIAL OPERATOR AND EIGEN EQUATION

Although, in microscopic systems, the quantum entity behaves sometimes like a particle and sometimes like a

2

wave, the symmetries of the system should be consistent no matter from the "particle" or the "wave" viewpoint. According to this principle, the differential operators representing physical quantities and the Schr¨odinger equation in quantum mechanics can be easily obtained. In order to see that, let's assume that there is a particle whose classical behavior is dominated by the canonical equation in Eq. (1), and due to wave-particle duality, the corresponding wave can be denoted as a function (q, t) where q is the generalized coordinate of the particle in Hamiltonian mechanics. (It can be conceivable that the wave function (q, t) must be related to the distribution of matter in the generalized coordinate space, since "wave" is also a form of matter.) Now suppose that the particle system has a translation invariance (symmetry) with respect to the generalized coordinate q. As mentioned above, the corresponding wave (q, t) should have the same translation invariance, which means that the wave (q, t) and the shifted wave (q + a, t) should correspond to the same observables, here a denotes the translational value of the generalized coordinate.
We will see that the translation invariance (symmetry) of the system will impose severe constraints on the wave function (q, t). First, the wave (q, t) cannot be a constant in the whole coordinate space because no interference fringes can be generated by such a wave. Secondly, the quantity (q, t)(q, t) should be an observable (analogy with the observable light intensity in an electromagnetic field, i.e., E(r, t)E(r, t), here E(r, t) is just the electromagnetic wave at coordinate r and time t) which will be invariant under the translation transformation, i.e., (q + a, t)(q + a, t) = (q, t)(q, t). Hence, the only possible situation of the wave function (q, t) under the translation transformation is that

(q + a, t) = eiaf(q)(q, t)

(2)

with a real function f (q). In order to see what we can obtain from Eq. (2), we
do the Taylor expansion on both sides of Eq. (2), i.e.,

(q + a, t)

=

(q,

t)

+

a(q,

t)

+

a2 2



(q,

t)

+

...

(3)

eiaf(q)(q, t)

=

[1

+

iaf (q)

-

a2f 2(q) 2

+

...](q,

t).

(4)

Here, the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the generalized coordinate q. Since Eq. (2) is true for any value a, the corresponding terms in Eqs. (3) and (4) must be equal. According to the second and third terms in Eqs. (3) and (4), we have

(q, t) = if (q)(q, t),

(5)

(q, t) = -f 2(q)(q, t).

(6)

Now we take the derivative of both sides of Eq. (5) with respect to q, we have

(q, t) = if (q)(q, t) + if (q)(q, t).

(7)

Substituting Eqs. (5) and (6) into Eq. (7) and using the fact that the wave (q, t) cannot be zero in the whole coordinate space, it is easy to obtain

f (q) = 0,

(8)

which means that the function f (q) can only be a constant, denoted by k. Then according to Eq. (5), we have

 -i  q

(q,

t)

=

k(q,

t),

(9)

which is an eigen equation of the Hermitian operator

-i

 q

with

the

eigenfunction

(q, t)

and

the

eigenvalue

k. The eigenvalue k is a real number because in mathe-

matics, the eigenvalues of any Hermitian operator are all

real numbers.

What Eq. (9) means is that when a particle system

has a translation invariance with respect to a generalized

coordinate q (the corresponding generalized momentum p

is a constant), the corresponding wave (q, t) must sat-

isfy

the

eigen

equation

of

the

Hermitian

operator

-i

 q

,

vice versa. Hence, the eigenvalue k in Eq. (9) should be

directly related to the generalized momentum p. Mean-

while, the important Planck constant , which can reflect

the quantum properties of a microscopic system, is obvi-

ously absent in Eq. (9). However, we can always multiply

both sides of Eq. (9) by the Planck constant , then Eq.

(9) becomes

-i

 q

(q,

t)

=

k(q, t).

(10)

In fact, the number k in Eq. (10) is just the momentum

p of the particle, which can be directly verified by sub-

stituting the plane electromagnetic wave eikq to (q, t)

in Eq. (10) with the Einstein's hypothesis that the pho-

ton's momentum p satisfies p = k [20­22]. Therefore,

it can be concluded that operating on the wave function

(q, t), the Hermitian operator -i

 q

will give out the

value of momentum p of the system, hence the Hermitian

operator -i

 q

can be considered as the generalized mo-

mentum operator (denoted by p^). In fact, the momentum

operator -i

 q

is

exactly

the

famous

Born's

assumption

in the establishment of quantum mechanics, while here

we know that the form of the momentum operator comes

from the translation invariance (symmetry) in Hamilto-

nian mechanics.

If we take the complex conjugate to both sides of Eq.

(10), we have

i  (q, t) = p(q, t)

(11)

q

with p = k. It means that operating on the eigenfunc-

tion (q, t), the differential operator i

 q

can

also

give

out the same momentum p of the system as the operator

-i

 q

.

Hence,

we

can

also

choose

the

differential

opera-

tor i

 q

as

the

generalized

momentum

operator

p^ of

the

system.

3

III. COMMUTATION RELATION

From the analysis above, we can see that due to wave-

particle duality, the generalized momentum p will be re-

placed with the momentum operator p^ (= ±i

 q

).

How-

ever, the generalized coordinate q is still the same as that

in Hamiltonian mechanics. The reason is that in the

analysis above we study the wave function in generalized

coordinate space (called coordinate representation). If

we do that in generalized momentum space (called mo-

mentum representation), the situation is the opposite.

It means that the generalized coordinate and momen-

tum will be replaced by operators when the quantum

entity exhibits the properties of waves, and in coordi-

nate (momentum) representation, the coordinate (mo-

mentum) operator is the coordinate (momentum) itself.

Since the physical quantities (generalized coordinates

and generalized momentum, as well as the Hamiltonian of

the system) in quantum mechanics are represented by op-

erators, the order in which they act on the wave function

becomes important. The fundamental commutation re-

lation (order relationship) between the generalized coor-

dinate q and the generalized momentum operator ±i

 q

can be directly obtained as

[ ±i

 q

,

q

]

=

±i

,

(12)

according

to

[

 q

,

q]

=

1

with

the

definition

[A^,

B^ ]

=

A^B^ -B^A^. According to Eq. (12), we can obtain the com-

mutation relation between any operator and the Hamil-

tonian operator of the system. In fact, the equation with

minus sign in Eq. (12) is exactly the Dirac's canonical

quantization rule which we obtain very naturally here.

IV. ENERGY OPERATOR AND SCHRO¨ DINGER EQUATION

In classical mechanics, the energy will be conserved if the Hamiltonian of the system is time independent. In this case, the system is said to have time translation invariance (symmetry). As previously mentioned, if there is some translation invariance in a particle system, then the corresponding wave must also have that. It means that when the particle system has the time translation invariance, the corresponding wave function (q, t) must satisfy the condition that (q, t + t0)(q, t + t0) = (q, t)(q, t), here t0 denotes the translational value of time. Hence, the only possible situation of the shifted wave function (q, t + t0) is that

(q, t + t0) = eit0f(t)(q, t)

(13)

with a real function f (t). Now we do the Taylor expansion on both sides of Eq. (13), i.e.,

(q, t + t0)

=

(q, t)

+

t0(q,

t)

+

t20 2

(q,

t)

+

...

(14)

eit0f(t)(q, t)

=

[1

+

it0f (t)

-

t20f 2(t) 2

+

...](q,

t).

(15)

Here, the prime denotes the derivative with respect to time t. Since Eq. (13) is true for any value t0, the corresponding terms in Eqs. (14) and (15) must be equal. According to the second and third terms in Eqs. (14) and (15), we have

(q, t) = if (t)(q, t),

(16)

(q, t) = -f 2(t)(q, t).

(17)

According to Eqs. (16) and (17) and with the similar calculations in Eqs. (5)­(8), it is easy to obtain

f (t) = 0.

(18)

It means that f (t) can only be a constant. Hence, multipling both sides of Eq. (16) by the Planck constant , it is easy to obtain that the change of the wave function (q, t) with time will satisfy

-i

 t

(q,

t)

=

E(q,

t).

(19)

Here, the constant E should be the energy of the system,

which can be verified by substituting the plane electro-

magnetic wave eit to (q, t) in Eq. (19) with the Ein-

stein's hypothesis that the photon's energy E satisfies

E =  [20­22]. Therefore, it can be concluded that op-

erating on the wave function (q, t), the Hermitian op-

erator -i

 t

will give out the value of energy E of the

system.

Hence,

the

Hermitian

operator

-i

 t

can

be

considered as the energy operator of the system. If we

take the complex conjugate to both sides of Eq. (19), we

have

i  (q, t) = E(q, t).

(20)

t

It means that operating on the eigenfunction (q, t), the

differential operator i

 t

can

give

the

same

energy

E

of

the system. Hence, we can also choose i

 t

as

the

energy

operator of the system.

Meanwhile, there exists another energy operator in the system, i.e., the Hamiltonian operator H^ (q^, p^, t) since the

Hamiltonian function H(q, p, t) is just the energy of the

system in Hamiltonian mechanics. It means that the two

Hermitian operators are equivalent when they operate on

a wave function, i.e.,

±i

 t



H^ (q^, p^, t).

(21)

Hence, according to Eq. (21), the time evolution of a wave function (q, t) will satisfy

±i

 (q, t) = H^ (q^, p^, t)(q, t). t

(22)

4

In fact, if we choose one equation in Eq. (22) (for ex-

ample, the one with plus sign) to describe the behavior

of a particle, then the other equation will describe the

behavior of an antiparticle. It can be seen from Eq. (22)

that if we choose -i

 q

as the momentum operator p^,

the equation with plus sign in Eq. (22) is just the famous

Schr¨odinger equation in quantum mechanics.

V. CONCLUSION
In summary, due to wave-particle duality in microscopic systems, Hamiltonian mechanics describing the macroscopic properties of a system has to be replaced

by quantum mechanics when we study the properties of quantum-scale objects. According to the principle that the symmetries of a system must be consistent in quantum mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics, we obtain the famous Schr¨odinger equation and the form of the differential operators representing mechanical quantities in quantum mechanics. The fact that the wave function satisfies the eigen equation of some differential operator is exactly the reflection of the symmetry of the system. In addition, according to the form of the differential operator, the commutation relation between the generalized coordinate operator and the generalized momentum operator can be directly obtained.
