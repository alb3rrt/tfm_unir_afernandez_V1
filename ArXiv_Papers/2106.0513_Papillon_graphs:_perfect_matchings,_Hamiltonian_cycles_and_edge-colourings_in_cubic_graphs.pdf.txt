Abstract A graph G has the Perfect-Matching-Hamiltonian property (PMH-property) if for each
one of its perfect matchings, there is another perfect matching of G such that the union of the two perfect matchings yields a Hamiltonian cycle of G. The study of graphs that have the PMH-property, initiated in the 1970s by Las Vergnas and Ha¨ggkvist, combines three well-studied properties of graphs, namely matchings, Hamiltonicity and edge-colourings. In this work, we study these concepts for cubic graphs in an attempt to characterise those cubic graphs for which every perfect matching corresponds to one of the colours of a proper 3-edge-colouring of the graph. We discuss that this is equivalent to saying that such graphs are even-2-factorable (E2F), that is, all 2-factors of the graph contain only even cycles. The case for bipartite cubic graphs is trivial, since if G is bipartite then it is E2F. Thus, we restrict our attention to non-bipartite cubic graphs. A sufficient, but not necessary, condition for a cubic graph to be E2F is that it has the PMH-property. The aim of this work is to introduce two infinite families of non-bipartite cubic graphs, which we term papillon graphs and unbalanced papillon graphs, and determine the values of their respective parameters for which these graphs have the PMH-property or are just E2F.

1 Introduction
Let G be a connected graph of even order with vertex set V (G) and edge set E(G). A k-factor of G is a k-regular spanning subgraph of G (not necessarily connected). Two very well-studied concepts in graph theory are perfect matchings and Hamiltonian cycles, where the former is the edge set of a 1-factor and the latter is a connected 2-factor of a graph. For t  3, a cycle of length t (or a t-cycle), denoted by Ct = (v1, . . . , vt), is a sequence of mutually distinct vertices v1, v2, . . . , vt with corresponding edge set {v1v2, . . . , vt-1vt, vtv1}. For definitions not explicitly stated here we refer the reader to [4]. A graph G admitting a perfect matching is said to have the Perfect-Matching-Hamiltonian property (for short the PMH-property) if for every perfect matching M of G there exists another perfect matching N of G such that the edges of M  N induce a Hamiltonian cycle of G. For simplicity, a graph admitting this property is said to be PMH. This property was first studied in the 1970s by Las Vergnas [13] and Ha¨ggkvist [9], and for more recent results about the PMH-property we suggest the reader to [1, 2, 3, 7, 8]. In [3], a property stronger than the PMH-property is studied: the Pairing-Hamiltonian property, for short the PH-property. Before proceeding to the definition of this property, we first define what a pairing is. For any graph G, KG denotes the complete graph on the same vertex set V (G) of G. A perfect matching of KG is said to be a pairing of G, and a graph G is said to have the Pairing-Hamiltonian property if every pairing M of G can be extended to a Hamiltonian cycle H of KG such that E(H) - M  E(G). Clearly, a graph having the PH-property is also PMH, although the converse is not necessarily true. Amongst other results, the authors of [3] show that the only cubic graphs admitting the PH-property are the complete graph K4, the complete bipartite graph K3,3, and the cube Q3. However, this does not mean that these are the only three cubic graphs admitting the PMH-property. For instance, all cubic 2-factor Hamiltonian graphs (all 2-factors of such a graph form a Hamiltonian cycle) are PMH (see for example [5, 6, 10, 11, 12]).
If a cubic graph G is PMH, then every perfect matching of G corresponds to one of the colours of a (proper) 3-edge-colouring of the graph, and we say that every perfect matching can be extended to a 3-edge-colouring. This is achieved by alternately colouring the edges of the Hamiltonian cycle containing a predetermined perfect matching using two colours, and then colouring the edges not belonging to the Hamiltonian cycle using a third colour. However, there are cubic graphs which are not PMH but have every one of their perfect matchings that can be extended to a 3-edge-colouring (see for example Figure 1). The following theorem characterises all cubic graphs for which every one of their perfect matchings can be extended to a 3-edge-colouring of the graph.

Theorem 1.1. Let G be a cubic graph admitting a perfect matching. Every perfect matching of G can be extended to a 3-edge-colouring of G if and only if all 2-factors of G contain only even cycles.
Proof. Let F be a 2-factor of G, and let M be the perfect matching E(G)-E(F ). Since M can be extended to a 3-edge-colouring of G, F can be 2-edge-coloured, and hence F does not contain any odd cycles. Conversely, let M be a perfect matching of G, and let F be its complementary 2-factor, that is, E(F ) = E(G)-M . Since F contains only even cycles, M can be extended to a 3-edge-colouring, by assigning a first colour to all of its edges and then alternately colour the edges of the 2-factor F using another two colours.
We shall call graphs in which all 2-factors consist only of even cycles as even-2factorable graphs, denoted by E2F for short. In particular, from Theorem 1.1, if a cubic graph G has the PMH-property, then it is also E2F. As in the proof of Theorem 1.1, in the sequel, given a perfect matching M of a cubic graph G, the 2-factor obtained after deleting the edges of M from G is referred to as the complementary 2-factor of M .
If a cubic graph is bipartite, then trivially, each of its perfect matchings can be extended to a 3-edge-colouring, since it is E2F. But what about non-bipartite cubic graphs? In Table 1, we show that the number of non-bipartite cubic graphs G (having girth at least 4) such that each one of their perfect matchings can be extended to a 3-edge-colouring is not insignificant, and the data suggests that this number increases considerably with the order of G. The numbers shown in this table were obtained thanks to a computer check done by Jan Goedgebeur, and the data is sorted according to the cyclic connectivity of the graphs considered. We remark that the reason why only graphs having girth at least 4 were considered, is because cubic graphs admitting the above properties and having girth 3 are somewhat different and shall be discussed further in an upcoming paper.

Table 1: The number of non-bipartite cubic 3-connected graphs with girth at least 4 which are E2F
A complete characterisation of which cubic graphs are PMH is still elusive, so considering the Class I non-bipartite cubic graphs having the property that each one of their perfect matchings can be extended to a 3-edge-colouring may look presumptuous. As far as we

4
know this property and the corresponding characterisation problem were never considered before and tackling the following problem seems a reasonable step to take. Problem 1.2. Characterise the Class I non-bipartite cubic graphs for which each one of their perfect matchings can be extended to a 3-edge-colouring, that is, are E2F.
We remark that although the PMH-property is an appealing property in its own right, Problem 1.2 continues to justify its study in relation to cubic graphs. Observe that in the family of cubic graphs, whilst snarks are not 3-edge-colourable, even-2-factorable graphs are quite the opposite being "very much 3-edge-colourable", since the latter can be 3-edgecoloured by assigning a colour to one of its perfect matchings, and then alternately colour the edges of the complementary 2-factor.
1.1 Cycle permutation graphs Consider two disjoint cycles each of length t, referred to as the first and second t-cycles and denoted by (x1, . . . , xt) and (y1, . . . , yt), respectively. Let  be a permutation of the symmetric group St on the t symbols {1, . . . , t}. The cycle permutation graph corresponding to  is the cubic graph obtained by considering the first and second t-cycles in which xi is adjacent to y(i), where (i) is the image of i under the permutation .
Figure 2: Two different drawings of the smallest non-bipartite E2F cubic graph
The smallest non-bipartite cubic graph which is E2F is in fact a cycle permutation graph corresponding to  = (1 2)  S4, where (1) = 2, (2) = 1, (3) = 3, and (4) = 4 (see Table 1 and Figure 2). This shows that the edges between the vertices of the first and second 4-cycles of the cycle permutation graph are x1y2, x2y1, x3y3, x4y4. In what follows we shall denote permutations in cycle notation and, for simplicity, fixed points shall be suppressed. According to another computer check we conducted through Wolfram Mathematica [14], quite a large number of the non-bipartite E2F cubic graphs given in Table 1 are also cycle permutation graphs (see Table 2). We remark that, in the sequel, cycle permutation graphs with total number of vertices equal to twice an odd number are not considered because, in this case, the first and second cycles form a 2-factor consisting of two odd cycles, and so they are trivially not E2F.
Recall that PMH cubic graphs are also E2F, and so, PMH cycle permutation graphs should be searched for from amongst the cycle permutation graphs which are E2F. However, as Table 2 suggests, for a given number of vertices , the number of non-bipartite cycle permutation graphs on  vertices which are PMH is very small compared to the number of non-bipartite E2F cycle permutation graphs on the same number of vertices. This suggests

Table 2: The number of non-bipartite cycle permutation graphs with girth at least 4 which are E2F and PMH

that non-bipartite cycle permutation graphs which are PMH are hard to find. As already mentioned, by Theorem 1.1, bipartite cubic graphs are trivially E2F but are not necessarily PMH (see for example Figure 1). Although bipartite cubic graphs are not the main scope of this paper, we remark that the number of bipartite cycle permutation graphs which are PMH seems to be very small. By doing a computer check as the one conducted above, the only bipartite cycle permutation graphs having the PMH-property on at most 20 vertices are two: the cube and the bipartite cycle permutation graph on 16 vertices corresponding to the permutation (3 7)(4 8)  S8.
This work is a first structured attempt at tackling Problem 1.2. We give an infinite family of non-bipartite cycle permutation graphs which admit the PMH-property. In Section 2, we generalise the smallest cubic graph which is E2F into a family of non-bipartite cycle permutation graphs {Pn}nN (which we term papillon graphs) whose first member is, in fact, the graph in Figure 2. We show that Pn is E2F for every n  N and PMH for every even n  N. In Section 3, we then generalise further the family of papillon graphs by defining the unbalanced papillon graphs on two parameters r and , for 1  r < . We prove that unbalanced papillon graphs are also E2F for all values of r and and PMH if and only if both r and are even.
2 Papillon graphs
Definition 2.1. For n  N, the nth papillon graph Pn is the graph on 8n vertices such that V (Pn) = {u1, . . . , u4n, v1, . . . , v4n}, where:
(i) (u1, u2, . . . , u4n) is a cycle of length 4n;
(ii) ui is adjacent to vi, for each i  [4n]; and
(iii) if n = 1, then (v1, v2, v4, v3) is a cycle of length 4, whereas if n  2, then the adjacencies between the vertices vi, for i  [4n], form a cycle of length 4n given by the edge set
{v2i-1v2i : i  [2n]}  {v2i-1v2i+2 : i  [2n - 1] \ {n}}  {v2v2n+2, v2n-1v4n-1}.
The papillon graph Pn for n  2 is depicted in Figure 3. The 4n-cycle induced by the vertices {ui : i  [4n]} is referred to as the outer-cycle, whilst the 4n-cycle induced by the vertices {vi : i  [4n]} is referred to as the inner-cycle. The edges on these two 4ncycles are said to be the outer-edges and inner-edges accordingly, whilst the edges uivi

6

are referred to as spokes. The edges u1u4n, v2n-1v4n-1, v2v2n+2, u2nu2n+1, are denoted by a, b, c, d, respectively, and we shall also denote the set {a, b, c, d} by X . The set X is referred to as the principal 4-edge-cut of Pn.

Figure 3: The papillon graph Pn, for n  2

The graph in Figure 2 is actually the first papillon graph P1, and in Figure 4 we depict the papillon graph P3. We first note that these graphs are non-bipartite since the cycle (u1, u2, . . . , u2n, u2n+1, v2n+1, v2n+2, v2, v1) is a cycle of Pn on 2n + 5 vertices. Furthermore, since {ui : i  [4n]} and {vi : i  [4n]} induce two disjoint 4n-cycles in Pn, and since every vertex belonging to the outer-cycle is adjacent to exactly one vertex on the inner-cycle, there exists an isomorphism  between the papillon graph Pn and a cycle permutation graph corresponding to some   S4n satisfying (xi) = ui and (yi) = v-1(i), for each i  [4n]. In fact, the nth papillon graph Pn is the cycle permutation graph corresponding to the permutation 1 := (1 2) when n = 1, to 2 := (1 2)(3 4)(5 7)(6 8) when n = 2, and to n := (1 2) . . . (2n - 1 2n)(2n + 1 4n - 1)(2n + 2 4n)(2n + 3 4n - 3)(2n + 4 4n - 2) . . . ( ), otherwise, where ( ) = (3n 3n + 2) if n is even, and ( ) = (3n - 1 3n + 3) if n is odd. We remark that n has no fixed points when n is even, but, when n is odd, 3n and 3n + 1 are fixed points of the permutation, and thus, in this case, x3n is adjacent to y3n and x3n+1 is adjacent to y3n+1 in Pn. Note that since n is an involution for all positive integers n, the isomorphism  mentioned above can be rewritten as follows: (xi) = ui and (yi) = v(i), for each i  [4n]. Moreover, the papillon graph Pn admits a natural automorphism  which exchanges the two cycles, given by (ui) = vn(i) and (vi) = un(i), for each i  [4n]. In fact, the function  is clearly bijective. Moreover, it maps edges of the outer-cycle to edges of the inner-cycle (and vice-versa), and maps spokes to spokes, since the edges uivi are mapped to un(i)vn(i).
Before proceeding we introduce multipoles which generalise the notion of graphs. This will become useful when describing papillon graphs. A multipole Z consists of a set of vertices V (Z) and a set of generalised edges such that each generalised edge is either

an edge in the usual sense (that is, it has two endvertices) or a semiedge. A semiedge is a generalised edge having exactly one endvertex. The set of semiedges of Z is denoted by Z whilst the set of edges of Z having two endvertices is denoted by E(Z). Two semiedges are joined if they are both deleted and their endvertices are made adjacent. A k-pole is a multipole with k semiedges. A perfect matching M of a k-pole Z is a subset of generalised edges of Z such that every vertex of Z is incident with exactly one generalised edge of M . In what follows, we shall construct papillon graphs by joining together semiedges of a number of multipoles. In this sense, given a perfect matching M of a graph G, and a multipole Z used as a building block to construct G, we shall say that M contains a semiedge e of the multipole Z, if M contains the edge in G obtained by joining e to another semiedge in the process of constructing G.
The 4-pole Z with vertex set {z1, z2, z3, z4}, such that E(Z) induces the 4-cycle (z1, z2, z3, z4) and with exactly one semiedge incident to each of its vertices is referred to as a C4-pole (see Figure 5). For each i  [4], let the semiedge incident to zi be denoted by fi. The semiedges f1 and f2 are referred to as the upper left semiedge and the upper right semiedge of Z, respectively. On the other hand, the semiedges f3 and f4 are referred to as the lower left semiedge and the lower right semiedge of Z, respectively (see Figure
5). For some integer n  1, let Z1, . . . , Zn be n copies of the above C4-pole Z. For
each j  [n], let V (Zj) = {z1j, z2j, z3j, z4j}, and let f1j, f2j, f3j, f4j be the semiedges of Zj respectively incident to z1j, z2j, z3j, z4j such that f1j and f2j are the upper left and upper right semiedges of Zj, whilst f3j and f4j are the lower left and lower right semiedges of Zj. A chain of C4-poles of length n  2, is the 4-pole obtained by respectively joining f2j and f4j (upper and lower right semiedges of Zj) to f1j+1 and f3j+1 (upper and lower left semiedges of Zj+1), for every j  [n - 1]. When n = 1, a chain of C4-poles of length 1 is just a C4-pole. For simplicity, we shall refer to a chain of C4-poles of length n, as a n-chain of C4-poles, or simply a n-chain. The semiedges f11 and f31 (similarly, f2n and f4n) are referred

to as the upper left and lower left (respectively, upper right and lower right) semiedges of the n-chain. A chain of C4-poles of any length has exactly four semiedges. For simplicity, when we say that e1, e2, e3, e4 are the four semiedges of a chain Z of C4-poles (possibly of length 1), we mean that e1 and e2 are respectively the upper left and upper right semiedges of Z , whilst e3 and e4 are respectively the lower left and lower right semiedges of the same chain Z (see Figure 6). The semiedges e1 and e2 (similarly, e3 and e4) are referred to collectively as the upper semiedges (respectively, lower semiedges) of Z . In a similar way, the semiedges e1 and e3 (similarly, e2 and e4) are referred to collectively as the left semiedges (respectively, right semiedges) of Z .

In order to construct the papillon graph Pn using C4-poles as building blocks, for each j  [2n], we consider the 4-pole Tj arising from the cycle (u2j-1, u2j, v2j, v2j-1) of Pn, whose semiedges are ej1, ej2, ej3, ej4 as in Figure 5. The two n-chains giving rise to Pn consist of T1, . . . , Tn (referred to as the right n-chain of Pn), and Tn+1, . . . , T2n (referred to as the left n-chain of Pn), which have semiedges e11, en2 , e13, en4 , and en1 +1, e22n, en3 +1, e24n, respectively. The papillon graph Pn is then obtained by joining the semiedges in pairs as follows: e11 to e22n, en2 to en1 +1, e13 to en3 +1, and en4 to e24n.
2.1 Main results
Let M be a perfect matching of Pn. Since X = {a, b, c, d} is a 4-edge-cut of Pn, |M  X |  0 (mod 2), that is, |M  X | is 0, 2 or 4. The following is a useful lemma which shall be used frequently in the results that follow.
Lemma 2.2. Let M be a perfect matching of the papillon graph Pn and let X be its principal 4-edge-cut. If |M  X | = k, then |M  Tj| = k, for each j  [2n].
Proof. Let M be a perfect matching of Pn. We first note that the left semiedges of a C4pole are contained in a perfect matching if and only if the right semiedges of the C4-pole are contained in the same perfect matching. The lemma is proved by considering three

9
cases depending on the possible values of k, that is, 0, 2 or 4. When n = 1, the result clearly follows since X is made up by joining T1 and T2 accordingly. So assume n  2.
Case I. k = 0. Since a and c do not belong to M , the left semiedges of T1 are not contained in M , and so M cannot contain its right semiedges. Therefore, |M  T1| = 0. Consequently, the left semiedges of T2 are not contained in M implying again that |M  T2| = 0. By repeating the same argument up till the nth C4-pole, we have that |M  Tj| = 0, for every j  [n]. By noting that c and d do not belong to M and repeating a similar argument to the 4-poles in the left n-chain, we can deduce that |M  Tj| = 0 for every j  [2n].
Case II. k = 4. Since a and c belong to M , the left semiedges of T1 are contained in M , and so M contains its right semiedges as well. Therefore, |M  T1| = 4. Consequently, the left semiedges of T2 are contained in M implying again that |M  T2| = 4. As in Case I, by noting that both c and d belong to M and repeating a similar argument to the 4-poles in the left n-chain, we can deduce that |M  Tj| = 4 for every j  [2n].
Case III. k = 2. We first claim that when k = 2, M  X must be equal to {a, d} or {b, c}. For, suppose that M  X = {a, c}, without loss of generality. This means that the right semiedges of T1 are also contained in M , implying that |M  T1| = 4. This implies that the left semiedges of T2 are contained in M , which forces |M  Tj| to be equal to 4, for every j  [2n]. In particular, |M  Tn| = 4, implying that the edges b and d belong to M , a contradiction since M  X = {a, c}. This proves our claim. Since the natural automorphism  of Pn, which exchanges the outer- and inner-cycles, exchanges also {a, d} with {b, c}, without loss of generality, we may assume that M X = {a, d}. Since c  M , 1  |M T1| < 4. But, T1 corresponds to a 4-edge-cut in Pn, and so, by using a parity argument, |M  T1| must be equal to 2, implying that exactly one of the right semiedges of T1 is contained in M . This means that exactly one left semiedge of T2 is contained in M , and consequently, by a similar argument now applied to T2, we obtain |M  T2| = 2. By repeating the same argument and noting that Tn+1 has exactly one left semiedge (corresponding to the edge d) contained in M , one can deduce that |M  Tj| = 2 for every j  [2n].
The following two results are two consequences of the above lemma and they both follow directly from the proof of Case III. In a few words, if a perfect matching M of Pn intersects its principal 4-edge-cut in exactly two of its edges, then these two edges are either the pair {a, d} or the pair {b, c}, and, for every j  [2n], M contains only one pair of semiedges of Tj which does not consist of the pair of left semiedges of Tj nor the pair of right semiedges of Tj.
Corollary 2.3. Let M be a perfect matching of Pn and let X be its principal 4-edge-cut. If |M  X | = 2, then M  X is equal to {a, d} or {b, c}.
Corollary 2.4. Let M be a perfect matching of Pn and let X be its principal 4-edge-cut such that |M  X | = 2. For each j  [2n], M contains exactly one of the following sets of semiedges: {ej1, ej2}, {ej3, ej4}, {ej1, ej4}, {ej2, ej3}, that is, of all possible pairs of semiedges of Tj, {ej1, ej3} and {ej2, ej4} cannot be contained in M .

In the sequel, the process of traversing one path after another shall be called concatenation of paths. If two paths P and Q have endvertices x, y and y, z, respectively, we write P Q to denote the path starting at x and ending at z obtained by traversing P and then Q. Without loss of generality, if x is adjacent to y, that is, P is a path on two vertices, we may write xyQ instead of P Q. Lemma 2.5. Let M1 be a perfect matching of Pn such that |M1  X | = 2.
(i) There exists a perfect matching M2 of Pn such that |M2  X | = 2 and M1  M2 = . (ii) The complementary 2-factors of M1 and M2 are both Hamiltonian cycles. Proof. (i) Since |M1  X | = 2, by Lemma 2.2 we get that |M1  Tj| = 2 for every j  [2n]. For each j, let P (j) be the subgraph of Pn which is induced by E(Tj) - M1. Note that 2j=n1V (P (j)) = V (Pn). By Corollary 2.4, each P (j) is a path of length 3. Letting N be the unique perfect matching of Pn which intersects each E(P (j)) in exactly two edges, we note that M1  N = . Let M2 = E(Pn) - (M1  N ). Since M1 and N are two disjoint perfect matchings, M2 is also a perfect matching of Pn and, in particular, M2 contains X - (M1  X ). Thus, |M2  X | = 2 and M1  M2 = , proving part (i).
Figure 7: Perfect matching M1 (bold edges) with |M1  X | = 2 and its complementary 2-factor (highlighted edges)
(ii) Let M2 be as in part (i), that is, |M2  X | = 2 and M1  M2 = . When n = 1, the result clearly follows. So assume n  2. For distinct i and j in [2n], let Q(i,j) be the subgraph of Pn which is induced by M2  {xy  E(Pn) : x  V (Ti), y  V (Tj)}, that is, E(Q(i,j)) is either empty or consists of exactly one edge, that is, Q(i,j) is a path of length 1. When M1  X = {a, d}, we can form a Hamiltonian cycle of Pn (not containing M1) by considering the following concatenation of paths:
P (1)Q(1,2) . . . Q(n-1,n)P (n)Q(n,2n)P (2n)Q(2n,2n-1) . . . P (n+1)Q(n+1,1), where Q(1,2) and Q(2n,2n-1) are respectively followed by P (2) and P (2n-1), and, Q(n,2n) and Q(n+1,1) consist of the edges b and c, respectively. On the other hand, when M1  X = {b, c}, we can form a Hamiltonian cycle of Pn (not containing M1) by considering the following concatenation of paths:
P (1)Q(1,2) . . . Q(n-1,n)P (n)Q(n,n+1)P (n+1)Q(n+1,n+2) . . . P (2n)Q(2n,1),

where Q(1,2) and Q(n+1,n+2) are respectively followed by P (2) and P (n+2), and, Q(n,n+1) and Q(2n,1) consist of the edges d and a, respectively. Thus, the complementary 2-factor of M1 is a Hamiltonian cycle. This is depicted in Figure 7. The proof that the complementary 2-factor of M2 is a Hamiltonian cycle follows analogously.
Theorem 2.6. The papillon graphs {Pn}nN are E2F.
Proof. Let M1 be a perfect matching of Pn. In order to show that Pn is E2F it suffices to show that the complementary 2-factor of M1 consists only of even cycles. Equivalently, by Theorem 1.1, we can show that Pn admits a perfect matching N such that M1  N = . We consider three cases, depending on |M1  X |.

Case I. |M1  X | = 0

By Lemma 2.2, for each j  [2n], |M1  Tj| = 0, and consequently, |M1  E(Tj)| = 2.

Since M1 is a perfect matching, E(Tj) - M1 is a matching consisting of two edges, for

each j  [2n]. Letting M2 = 2j=n1E(Tj) - M1, we obtain a perfect matching of Pn,

since

Case

I.

Case II. |M1  X | = 2 By Lemma 2.2, the complementary 2-factor of M1 is a Hamiltonian cycle, and so, since V (Pn) is even, the result follows.

Case III. |M1  X | = 4 The complementary 2-factor of M1 consists of 2n 4-cycles, implying that the complementary 2-factor consists of even cycles only.
Proposition 2.7. Let n be a positive odd integer. Then, the papillon graph Pn is not PMH.
Proof. Consider the following perfect matching of the papillon graph Pn:
M = 2i=n1{u2i-1u2i, v2i-1v2i}.
It is clear that when n = 1, the perfect matching M cannot be extended to a Hamiltonian cycle of the papillon graph P1. So assume that n  3. We claim that M cannot be extended to a Hamiltonian cycle of Pn. For, let F be a 2-factor of Pn containing M . Since u1u2  M and Pn is cubic, F contains exactly one of the following two edges: u1u4n or u1v1. In the former case, if u1u4n  E(F ), then, u2nu2n+1 and all the edges of the outer- and inner-cycle will belong to F (at the same time, the choice of u1u4n forbids all the spokes of Pn to belong to F ), yielding two disjoint cycles each of length 4n. In the latter case, if u1v1  E(F ), then F must also contain all spokes uivi, for 1 < i  4n. In fact, the subgraph induced by the set of spokes is exactly the complement of the 2-factor obtained in the former case. Consequently, F will consist of 2n disjoint 4-cycles.
Consider Pn, with n  2, and let M be a perfect matching of Pn with M  X = 0, which by Lemma 2.2 implies that |M2  Tj| = 0 for all j  [2n]. Now consider j  [2n] \ {n, 2n} and let T(j,j+1) denote a 2-chain composed of Tj and Tj+1 We say that T(j,j+1) is symmetric with respect to M if exactly one of the following occurs:
(i) {u2j-1v2j-1, u2j v2j , u2j+1v2j+1, u2j+2v2j+2}  M ; or

12
(ii) {u2j-1u2j , v2j-1v2j , u2j+1u2j+2, v2j+1v2j+2}  M . If neither (i) nor (ii) occur, T(j,j+1) is said to be asymmetric with respect to M . This is shown in Figure 8.

Remark 2.8. Let n  2. Consider a perfect matching M1 of Pn such that M1 does not intersect the principal 4-edge-cut X of Pn, that is, M1  X = , and consider a 2chain of Pn, say T(j,j+1) with j  [2n] \ {n, 2n}, having semiedges e1, e2, e3, e4, where e1 = ej1, e2 = ej2+1, e3 = ej3 and e4 = ej4+1. Assume there exists a perfect matching M2 of Pn such that |M2  X | = 2 and M1  M2 =  (see Figure 9). If T(j,j+1) is symmetric with respect to M1, then we have exactly one of the following instances:
M2  T(j,j+1) = {e1, e2} (upper); or M2  T(j,j+1) = {e3, e4} (lower). Otherwise, if T(j,j+1) is asymmetric with respect to M1, then exactly one of the following must occur:
M2  T(j,j+1) = {e1, e4} (upper left, lower right); or M2  T(j,j+1) = {e2, e3} (upper right, lower left).
Notwithstanding whether T(j,j+1) is symmetric or asymmetric with respect to M1, (M1  M2)  E(T(j,j+1)) induces a path (see Figure 9) which contains all the vertices of V (T(j,j+1)), and whose endvertices are the endvertices of the semiedges in M2 T(j,j+1). Remark 2.9. Let n  2. Consider a perfect matching M1 of Pn such that M1 does not intersect the principal 4-edge-cut X of Pn, that is, M1  X = , and consider a 2-chain of Pn, say T(j,j+1) with j  [2n] \ {n, 2n}. Let M2 be the perfect matching of Pn such that |M2  X | = 4. Clearly M1  M2 = . Notwithstanding whether T(j,j+1) is symmetric or asymmetric with respect to M1, we have that (M1  M2)  E(T(j,j+1)) induces two disjoint paths of equal length (see Figure 10) whose union contains all the vertices of Tj and Tj+1. Let Q be one of these paths. We first note that Q contains exactly one vertex from {uj, vj+1} and exactly one vertex from {uj+3, vj+2}. If T(j,j+1) is symmetric with respect to M1, then Q contains uj if and only if Q contains uj+3. Otherwise, if T(j,j+1) is asymmetric with respect to M1, then Q contains uj if and only if Q contains vj+2.

Theorem 2.10. Let n be a positive even integer. Then, the papillon graph Pn is PMH. Proof. Let M1 be a perfect matching of Pn. We need to show that there exists a perfect matching M2 of Pn such that M1  M2 induces a Hamiltonian cycle of Pn. Three cases, depending on the intersection of M1 with the principal 4-edge-cut X of Pn, are considered. If |M1  X | = 2, then, by Lemma 2.5, there exists a perfect matching N of Pn such that |N  X | = 2 and M1  N = . Moreover, the complementary 2-factor of N is a Hamiltonian cycle. Since M1 is contained in the mentioned 2-factor, the result follows. When |M1  X | = 4, we can define M2 to be the following perfect matching:
M2 = {u1v1, u2v2} 2j=n 2{u2j-1u2j , v2j-1v2j }.
In fact, M1  M2 induces the following Hamiltonian cycle: (u1, v1, v4, . . . , v2n, v2n-1, v4n-1, v4n, v4n-3, . . . , v2n+1, v2n+2, v2, u2, u3, u4, . . . , u4n), where v4 and v4n-3 are respectively followed by v3 and v4n-2.

What remains to be considered is the case when |M1X | = 0. Clearly, |M2X | cannot

be zero, because, if so, choosing M2 to be disjoint from M1, M1  M2 induces 2n disjoint

4-cycles. Therefore, |M2  X | must be equal to 2 or 4. Let R = {T(1,2), . . . , T(n-1,n)} and

L = {T(n+1,n+2), . . . , T(2n-1,2n)} be the sets of 2-chains within the left and right n-chains

of Pn--namely the right and left n-chains each split into

n 2

2-chains.

We consider two

cases depending on the parity of the number of 2-chains in L and R which are asymmetric

with respect to M1. Let the function  : R  L  {-1, +1} be defined on the 2-chains

T  R  L such that:

(T ) = +1 if T is symmetric with respect to M1, -1 otherwise.

Case 1. L and R each have an even number (possibly zero) of asymmetric 2-chains with
respect to M1. We claim that there exists a perfect matching such that its union with M1 gives a Hamil-
tonian cycle of Pn. Since the number of asymmetric 2-chains in R is even, T R (T ) = +1, and consequently, appropriately concatenating paths as in Remark 2.8, there exists a path R with endvertices u1 and u2n whose vertex set is 2i=n1{ui, vi} such that it contains all the edges in M1  (ni=1E(Ti)). We remark that this path intersects exactly one edge of {xy  E(Pn) : x  V (Tj), y  V (Tj+1)}, for each j  [n - 1]. By a similar reasoning, since T L (T ) = +1, there exists a path L with endvertices u2n+1 and u4n whose vertex set is 4i=n2n+1{ui, vi}, such that it contains all the edges in M1 (2i=nn+1E(Ti)). Once again, this path intersects exactly one edge of {xy  E(Pn) : x  V (Tj), y  V (Tj+1)}, for each j  {n + 1, . . . , 2n - 1}. These two paths, together with the edges a and d form
the required Hamiltonian cycle of Pn containing M1, proving our claim. We remark that this shows that there exists a perfect matching M2 of Pn such that M2  X = {a, d}, M1  M2 =  and with M1  M2 inducing a Hamiltonian cycle of Pn. One can similarly show that there exists a perfect matching M2 of Pn such that M2  X = {b, c}, M1  M2 =  and with M1  M2 inducing a Hamiltonian cycle of Pn.

Case 2. One of L and R has an odd number of asymmetric 2-chains with respect to M1. Without loss of generality, assume that R has an odd number of asymmetric 2-chains
with respect to M1, that is, T R (T ) = -1. Let M2 be the perfect matching of Pn such that |M2  X | = 4. We claim that M1  M2 induces a Hamiltonian cycle of Pn. Since
T R (T ) = -1, by appropriately concatenating paths as in Remark 2.9 we can deduce that M1  M2 contains the edge set of two disjoint paths R1 and R2, such that:
(i) |V (R1)| = |V (R2)| = 2n;
(ii) V (R1)  V (R2) = 2i=n1{ui, vi};
(iii) the endvertices of R1 are u1 and v2n-1; and
(iv) the endvertices of R2 are v2 and u2n.
Next, we consider two subcases depending on the value of T L (T ). We shall be using the fact that {u1u4n, v2n-1v4n-1, v2v2n+2, u2nu2n+1} = {a, b, c, d} = X  M2.

Case 2a) T L (T ) = -1

15
As above, by Remark 2.9, we can deduce that M1  M2 contains the edge set of two disjoint paths L1 and L2, such that:
(i) |V (L1)| = |V (L2)| = 2n;
(ii) V (L1)  V (L2) = 4i=n2n+1{ui, vi};
(iii) the endvertices of L1 are u2n+1 and v4n-1; and
(iv) the endvertices of L2 are v2n+2 and u4n.
The concatenation of the following paths and edges gives a Hamiltonian cycle of Pn containing M1:
R1v2n-1v4n-1L1u2n+1u2nR2v2v2n+2L2u4nu1. Case 2b) T L (T ) = +1.
Once again, by Remark 2.9 we can deduce that M1  M2 contains the edge set of two disjoint paths L1 and L2, such that:
(i) |V (L1)| = |V (L2)| = 2n;
(ii) V (L1)  V (L2) = 4i=n2n+1{ui, vi};
(iii) the endvertices of L1 are u2n+1 and u4n; and
(iv) the endvertices of L2 are v2n+2 and v4n-1.
The concatenation of the following paths and edges gives a Hamiltonian cycle of Pn containing M1:
R1v2n-1v4n-1L2v2n+2v2R2u2nu2n+1L1u4nu1. This completes the proof.
3 Unbalanced papillon graphs
Papillon graphs can be further generalised by adding or removing C4-poles from the left and right n-chains of our original construction, or equivalently, by joining accordingly the semiedges of two chains of different lengths, as follows.
Let r and be two positive integers such that r < . Consider an r-chain and an -chain whose semiedges are e1, e2, e3, e4 and e1, e2, e3, e4, respectively. The unbalanced papillon graph Pr, is the graph obtained by joining: e1 to e2, e2 to e1, e3 to e3, and e4 to e4.
For completeness, we also give the definition of unbalanced papillon graphs as in Definition 2.1 and subsequently in terms of cycle permutation graphs.
Definition 3.1. The unbalanced papillon graph Pr, is the graph on 4r + 4 vertices such that V (Pr, ) = {ui, vi : i  [2r + 2 ]}, where:
(i) (u1, u2, . . . , u2r+2 ) is a cycle of length 2r + 2 ;
(ii) ui is adjacent to vi, for each i  [2r + 2 ]; and

16
Figure 11: P1,3 and P3,4: unbalanced papillon graphs are not always PMH. The above perfect matchings do not extend to a Hamiltonian cycle.
(iii) the adjacencies between the vertices vi, for i  [2r + 2 ], form a cycle of length 2r + 2 given by the edge set {v2i-1v2i : i  [ + 1]}  {v2i-1v2i+2 : i  [ ] \ {1}}  {v1v2 +1, v2v4}, when r = 1, and the edge set {v2i-1v2i : i  [r + ]}  {v2i-1v2i+2 : i  [r + - 1] \ {r}}  {v2v2r+2, v2r-1v2r+2 -1}, otherwise.
The (2r + 2 )-cycles induced by the sets of vertices {ui : i  [2r + 2 ]} and {vi : i  [2r + 2 ]} are the outer-cycle and the inner-cycle of our unbalanced papillon graph, respectively. As in the original case, the unbalanced papillon graph Pr, is the cycle permutation graph, with (u1, . . . , u2r+2 ) as the first cycle, corresponding to the permutation:
· (3 4) . . . (2 + 1 2 + 2), with fixed points 1 and 2, when r = 1; · (1 2)(3 4)(5 9)(6 10), with fixed points 7 and 8, when r = 2 and = 3; and · (1 2) . . . (2r - 1 2r)(2r + 1 2r + 2 - 1)(2r + 2 2r + 2 )(2r + 3 2r + 2 - 3)(2r +
4 2r + 2 - 2) . . . ( ), otherwise, where ( ) = (2r + 2r + + 2) if is even, and ( ) = (2r + - 1 2r + + 3) if is odd. We remark that when r > 1, the above permutation has no fixed points when is even, but, when is odd, 2r + and 2r + + 1 are fixed points, that is, x2r+ is adjacent to y2r+ and x2r+ +1 is adjacent to y2r+ +1 in Pr, . In particular, we note that now the principal 4-edge-cut X of Pr, consists of the following edges: u1u2r+2 , v2r-1v2r+2 -1, v2v2r+2, u2ru2r+1, which can be respectively denoted by a, b, c, d as in Section 2. We remark that unbalanced papillon graphs are also non-bipartite, because the cycle (u1, u2, . . . , u2r, u2r+1, v2r+1, v2r+2, v2, v1) is a cycle of Pr, on 2r + 5 vertices. Moreover, by following the proofs in Section 2, the results obtained for papillon graphs can be extended to unbalanced papillon graphs in the following way.

17
Theorem 3.2. The unbalanced papillon graphs Pr, are E2F.
Proof. It suffices to observe that the statements of Lemma 2.2, Corollary 2.3, Corollary 2.4 and Lemma 2.5 would also hold if restated for unbalanced papillon graphs, so the proof that unbalanced papillon graphs are E2F is the same as the one proposed in Theorem 2.6.
Theorem 3.3. The unbalanced papillon graph Pr, is PMH if and only if r and are both even.
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of Proposition 2.7 and Theorem 2.10. In particular, when at least one of r and are odd, Pr, is not PMH because the perfect matching ri=+1 {u2i-1u2i, v2i-1v2i} of Pr, (illustrated in Figure 11) cannot be extended to a Hamiltonian cycle.
Since Pn is PMH for every even n  N, papillon graphs provide us with examples of non-bipartite PMH cubic graphs which are cyclically 4-edge-connected and have girth 4 such that their order is a multiple of 16. However, by considering unbalanced papillon graphs, say P2, , for some even > 2, we can obtain non-bipartite PMH cubic graphs having the above characteristics (that is, cyclically 4-edge-connected and having girth 4) such that their order is 8, for odd   3. Moreover, as can be seen in Table 2, there are no cycle permutation graphs on 8 and 20 vertices. It would be interesting to see whether these are just isolated cases or if there are infinitely many other integers , such that there does not exist a non-bipartite cycle permutation graph on  vertices which is PMH.
Finally, we remark that it would be very compelling to see whether there exist other 4poles instead of the C4-poles that can be used as building blocks when constructing papillon graphs and which yield non-bipartite PMH or just E2F cubic graphs.
