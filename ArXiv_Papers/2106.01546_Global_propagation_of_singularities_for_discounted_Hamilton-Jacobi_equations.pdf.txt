arXiv:2106.01546v2 [math.DS] 11 Jun 2021

ABSTRACT. The main purpose of this paper is to study the global propagation of singularities of viscosity solution to discounted Hamilton-Jacobi equation

( ) + ( , ( )) = 0,   .

(HJ )

We reduce the problem for equation (HJ ) into that for a time-dependent evolutionary HamiltonJacobi equation. We proved that the singularities of the viscosity solution of (HJ ) propagate along locally Lipschitz singular characteristics which can extend to +. We also obtained the homotopy equivalence between the singular set and the complement of associated the Aubry set with respect to the viscosity solution of equation (HJ ).

1. INTRODUCTION

It is commonly accepted that, in optimal control, a crucial role is played by the HamiltonJacobi equation

(, )+ (, , (0, ) = 0( )

( , )) = 0

( , )  + ×  ,  .

(HJ )

It is well known that the singularities of such solutions propagate locally along generalized characteristics. The evidence of irreversibility for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is the propagation of singularities. Once a singularity is created, it will propagate forward in time up to +. For a comprehensive survey of this topic, the readers can refer to [7].
The theory of local propagation of the singularities of the viscosity solutions of (HJ ) has been established in [2] by introducing the notion of generalized characteristics (see also [14], [26]). Other progress on the local propagation includes the strict singular characteristics ([22], see also [24]). A recent remarkable result by Cannarsa and Cheng established the relation between generalized characteristics and strict singular characteristics on 2 ([6]).
In the paper [4], Cannarsa and Cheng introduced an intrinsic method and obtained a global propagation result for time-independent Hamiltonian (see also [12]). By a procedure of supconvolution with the kernel the fundamental solutions of associated autonomous Hamilton-Jacobi equations, they constructed a global singular arc ( )  [0, 0]   from an initial singular point and 0 is independent of the initial point . The uniformness of such 0 holds because of uniform conditions (L1)-(L3) in [4] . In [5], they ask the following problem :

Can we drop the uniformness requirement of such 0 to obtain a global result ?

The first task of this paper is to drop the uniformness of 0 which can not be guaranteed by, e.g., the so called Fathi-Maderna conditions ([21]) which we will use for our purpose. In this paper, we showed that the answer to problem is affirmative for time-dependent case and discounted case.
There is a very natural connection between the discounted Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJ ) and the evolutionary Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJ ) using a conformal Hamiltonian (see, for instance, [23]) or a contact Hamiltonian (see, for instance, [15]). More precisely, if is the unique viscosity solution of (HJ ), we define

( , ) = ( ),

  , > 0.

Then ( , ) is a viscosity solution of (HJ ) with a time-dependent Hamiltonian in the form ( ,  ). Notice that and share the singularity. Thus, we can discuss the problem
of propagation of singularities for equation (HJ ) instead of equation (HJ ). We developed the intrinsic method in [4] adapt to our problem which has more technical difficulty comparing to the time-independent case ([9]).
Now we introduce the associated Lagrangian as

( , , ) = sup{  - ( , , )},


> 0,   ,   .

To deal with evolutionary Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJ ), we suppose = ( , , )   ×  ×    is of class 2 and satisfies the following assumptions:

(L1) ( , , ) is strict convex on  for all  [0, ],   . (L2) For any fixed > 0, there exist > 0 and two superlinear and nondecreasing function

,  [0, +)  [0, +), such that (| |)  ( , , )  (| |)- , for all ( , , ) 

[0, ] ×  ×  .

We say that a curve  [ , ]   is -calibrated curve for equation (HJ ) if

( ( )) - ( ( )) = 

( ( ),  ( )) ,

(1.1)

and a curve  [ , ]   is calibrated curve for equation (HJ ) if

( , ( )) - ( , ( )) =  ( , ( ),  ( )) .

(1.2)

A point   is a cut point of if no backward -calibrated curve of equation (HJ ) with Hamilton ending at can be extended beyond . A point ( , )  + ×  is a cut point of if no backward calibrated curve of equation (HJ ) with Hamilton ending at ( , ) can be extended beyond ( , ). In both cases, we denote by Cut ( ) the set of cut points of . If is a viscosity solution of (HJ ) or (HJ ), a singularity of is a point where is not differentiable. We
denote by Sing( ) the set of singularities of . It is well known that Sing ( )  Cut ( )  Sing ( ). Our main result for the time-dependent case is: Let be a Lagrangian which satisfies (L1)-(L3)
and let be the associated Hamiltonian. Suppose 0 = (0, )     is a Lipschitz continuous function. Then for any fixed ( 0, )  Cut( )  + ×  , there exists a curve

with ( 0) = , such that ( , ( ))  Sing( ) for all  [ 0, +). Moreover, If condition (A) (see Section 3) holds, then for any > 0, ( ) is a Lipschitz curve on  [ 0, ].
Similarly, for the discounted equation (HJ ) we denote by the associated Lagrangian of . We suppose = ( , )   ×    is of 2 class and satisfying the following assumptions:
(L1') ( , ) is strictly convex for all   . (L2') There exist 1, 2  0 and two superlinear functions 1, 2  [0, +)  [0, +) such that
2(| |) + 2  ( , )  1(| |) - 1, ( , )   ×  .
Our main result for the discounted case is: Let be a Lagrangian which satisfies (L1')-(L2') and be the associated Hamiltonian and > 0. Suppose     is a Lipschitz continuous semiconcave viscosity solution of (HJ ). Then
(1) for any fixed  Cut( ), there exists a locally Lipschitz curve  [0, +)   with (0) = , such that ( )  Sing( ) for all  [0, +),
(2) the inclusions

Sing( )  Cut( )   ( )  Sing( )   ( )

are all homotopy equivalences and the spaces Sing ( ) and Cut ( ) are all locally contractible.
It worth noting that the construction of the homotopy equivalence here we used is very similar to what used in [8], [11] and [9]. The general notion of the cut locus of for contact type Hamilton-Jacobi equation was studied in [16] recently for smooth initial data.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce Lax-Oleinik operator associated to (HJ ) and give our global result on the propagation of singularities along local Lipschitz curves under an extra condition (A). In Sect.3, we discuss the global propagation of singularities for discounted Hamiltonian (HJ ) and give homotopy equivalence results as an application.This paper contains three appendices which include some background materials and useful conclusions. In Appendix A, we collect some relevant regularity results with respect to the fundamental solution of (HJ ). In Appendix B and Appendix C, we give the proof of Lemma 2.2, Lemma 2.6 and Lemma 3.8.

Let ( , , ) be the associated Lagrangian of ( , , ). We assume that ( , , )  [0, +) ×  ×    is a 2-smooth function which satisfies the following standard assumptions:
(L1) ( , , ) > 0 for any ( , , )  [0, +) ×  ×  .

minimizers in (2.1) is a well known result in Tonelli's theory (see, for instance, [17]). Moreover,

we have the following proposition:

Proposition 2.1. Suppose satisfies (L1)-(L3). Then for any 0  < < + and ,   ,

In Appendix A, we collect some relevant regularity results with respect to the fundamental solution , ( , ). The proofs of these regularity results are similar to those in [4] for autonomous case.

where 1( , ) =  ( + 1) + + (0) for > 0 and  0.

Proposition 2.4. [13] The following properties hold.
(1) ( , ) is a viscosity solution of (HJ ). (2) ( , ) is locally linear semiconcave on (0, +) ×  . More precisely, for any 0 < 1 < 2
and > 0, there exists ( 1, 2, ) > 0 such that ( , ) is linearly semiconcave on ( 1, 2)× (0, ) with semiconcavity constant ( 1, 2, ). Moreover, ( 1, 2, ) is continuous with
respect to . (3) For any ( , )  (0, )× and any minimizer  0,, of (2.7), is differentiable at ( , ( ))
for all  (0, ).

Moreover, we have the following result

Proposition 2.5. [13, Thm 6.4.9] For any ( , )  (0, +) ×  , ( , )   ( , ) if and only if there exists a minimizer  0,, of (2.7) such that and = ( , ,  ( )) and = - ( , , ).
Lemma 2.6. (proved in Appendix B) For any fixed > 0, there exists 0( )  0 such that is a Lipschitz function on (0, ] ×  and Lip [ ]  0( ).
Due to Lemma 2.6 and Lemma 2.2, we obtain the following estimation:

Corollary 2.7. For any > 0, 0  1 < 2  and 1   , we have
( ( 2, ), 1, 1, 2)  ,
and for any  1, 2, 1 ( ( 2, ), 1, 1, 2), | - 1, 2, 1 1|  2( )( 2 - 1).

Proposition 2.8. Suppose is a Tonelli Lagrangian satisfying (L1)-(L3), is the associated Hamiltonian and 0     is a Lipschitz function.Then for any fixed   and 0 < 0 < , there exist ,  (0, ) which only depends on , such that for all 0  1  - , and 1

Proof. For any fixed   , > 0 , by proposition 2.4 (2), there exists ( , ) > 0 such that it is a semiconcavity constant for on [ 0, 0 + ] × ( , 2( ) ). By (3) of Proposition A.2, there exists 2( , ) > 0 such that it is a uniformly convexity constant for 1, ( 1, ) on [ 0, 0 + ] × ( , 2( ) ).

For 1 =  Cut( )  1 without loss of generality, then there exists 1 = , > 0 such

that ( 0, , ) is defined on [ 0, 0 + 1] by Proposition 2.8. One can extend by induction.

For ( 0, 0 + 1, )  1, then we define ( 0, , ) = ( 0 + 1, , ( 0, 0 + 1, )) for all 

[ 0+ 1, 0+2 1] ; inductively, if ( 0, , ) is defined on [ 0, 0+ 1] such that ( 0, 0+ 1, )  1

Theorem 2.11. If condition (A) holds, then for any > 0 and ( ) (see Theorem 2.9) is a Lipschitz curve on  [0, ].

The proof of the theorem above is a direct consequence of following Lemma.

Lemma 2.12. For any > 0 and ( 0, )  [0, ] ×  , let , and  [ 0, 0 + , ]   be given by Proposition 2.8. If condition (A) holds, then is Lipschitz on [ 0, 0 + , ].

Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume that 0 = 0. Let = 0, ,  0,, ( ), = 0, ,  0,, ( ) and = 0, ,  0,, ( ) be minimizers for 0, ( , ( )), 0, ( , ( )) and 0, ( , ( )) respectively. Setting = ( , ( ),  ( )), = ( , ( ),  ( )) and = ( , ( ),  ( )), we

have ( , )  + ( , ( )) and ( , )  + ( , ( )). Hence, by Proposition A.2, there exists

Lemma 3.1. [15, Proposition 3.3] ( ) is a viscosity solution of (HJ ) if and only if ( , ) = ( ) is a viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation

where  ( , , ) = ( , - ). Moreover, for any ( , )  (0 + ) ×  , we have

(3.2)

Remark 3.2. Since  [ , ]   is a calibrated curve of equation (HJ ) with Hamiltonian if and only if  [ , ]   is a calibrated curve of equation (3.1) with Hamiltonian  , then by the definition of Cut( ) in Definition 3.4,  Cut( ) and ( , )  Cut( ) are equivalent.

Theorem 3.3. Let be a Tonelli Hamiltonian and > 0. Suppose     is the Lipschitz continuous viscosity solution of (HJ ). Then for any fixed  Cut( ), there exists a locally Lipschitz curve  [0, +)   with (0) = , such that ( )  Sing( ) for all  [0, +).

Proof. By using the variable transformation = + 1  [1, +), we only need to find a locally Lipschitz curve  [1, +)   with (1) = , such that ( )  Sing( ) for all  [1, +). Due to (3.2),  Cut( ) implies (1, )  Cut( ). It is easy to check that ( , , ) = ( , ) satisfies (L1)-(L3). Therefore, by Theorem 2.9, there exists a curve  [1, +)   with
(1) = , such that ( , ( ))  Sing( ) for all  (1, +), that is, ( )  Sing( ) for all  (0, +). It remains to show that the curve ( )  [0, +)   is locally Lipschitz. Notice that ( , ) = ( ) is differentiable with respect to and
( , ) = ( ) = ( , ), ( , )  (0, +) ×  .
For any ( , )  (0, +) ×  and ( , )  (0, +) ×  , by Lemma 2.6, we have
| ( , ) - ( , )| = | ( , ) - ( , )|  0( )(| - | + | - |),
which implies condition (A) holds. Hence  [0, +)   is locally Lipschitz by Lemma 2.12.

3.2. Homotopy equivalence. Now, suppose     is the Lipschitz viscosity solution of

(HJ )

where is a Tonelli Hamiltonian and > 0.

Definition 3.4. (Aubry set): We define ( )1, the Aubry set of , as

( ) = {    there exists a calibrated curve  (-, +)   with (0) = }

In general we have the following inclusions: Sing ( )  Cut ( )    ( ), Sing ( )  Cut ( )  Sing ( ).

Theorem 3.5. The inclusions Sing ( )  Cut ( )    ( )  Sing ( )    ( )

are all homotopy equivalences.

This theorem obviously implies the following corollary (see, for instance, [18])

Corollary 3.6. For every connected component of  ( ), these three intersections Sing ( ) , Cut ( )  and Sing ( )  are path connected.

Theorem 3.7. [8, Thm. 1.3] The spaces Sing ( ) and Cut ( ) are locally contractible.

The proof of Theorem 3.5 and 3.7 needs the following Lemma.
Lemma 3.8. There exists a continuous homotopy   × [0, +)   with the following properties: (a) for all   , we have ( , 0) = ; (b) if ( , )  Sing( ) for some > 0 and   , then the curve  ( , ) is calibrated on
[0, ];

(c) if there exists a calibrated curve  [0, ]   with (0) = , then  ( , ) = ( ), for every  [0, ].

The proof of Lemma 3.8 is in Appendix C. These properties imply:

Lemma 3.9. (1) (Cut ( ) × (0, +))  Sing( ); (2) if ( , )  Sing ( ) for all  [0, +), then  ( ) and  ( , ),  [0, +) is a
forward calibrated curve with ( , 0) = ;
(3) if  ( ), then ( , )  ( ) for every  [0, +).

Now, for   , we define ( ) to be the supremum of the  0 such that there exists a calibrated curve  [0, ]   with (0) = .

Lemma 3.10. (i) ( ) = 0 if and only if  Cut ( ); (ii) ( ) = + if and only if  ( ); (iii) the function is upper semi-continuous.

Proof. (i) and (ii) follows directly from the definition of Cut ( ) and ( ). It remains to prove (iii). Indeed, we only need to prove that for any  > 0 the set {    ( )  } is closed.
Take any sequence such that ( )   and  0, and let  [0, ]   , (0) = be the associated calibrated curves. By taking a subsequence, we can assume that

lim


( ) = 0   ( 0).

Notice that  [0, ]   is the solution of (2.2) with initial condition (0) = , (0) = ( ). Let 0  [0, ]   be the solution of (2.2) with initial condition 0(0) = 0, 0(0) = 0.
It follows that converges to 0 in 2 topology. Thus, we have



(

0(

)) = lim 





(

( )) = lim 

(

(0)) + 0



( ( ),  ( ))

= ( 0(0)) + 0

( 0( ),  0( )) .

This implies 0  [0, ]   is a calibrated curve and ( 0)  . Therefore, the set {    ( )  } is closed and the function is upper semi-continuous.
Proof of Theorem 3.5. By Lemma 3.10, the function is upper semi-continuous and finite on   ( ). Thus, by Proposition 7.20 in [3], we can find a continuous function    ( )  (0, +) with > on   ( ). We now define  (  ( )) × [0, 1]    ( ) by
( , ) = ( , ( )).
Due to Lemma 3.8, Lemma 3.9 and the continuity of , the map ( , ) is a homotopy of  ( ) into itself, such that (  ( ), 1)  Sing ( ) and (Cut ( ), (0, 1])  Sing ( ). Therefore, the time one map of gives a homotopy inverse for each one of the inclusions
Sing ( )  Cut ( )  Sing ( )  (  ( ))    ( ).

3.3. genuine propagation of singularities. To study genuine propagation of singularities, we have to check that the singular arc in Theorem 3.3 is not a fixed point. As we show below, the following condition about strong critical point (see, for instance [14],[4]) can be useful for this purpose.
Definition 3.11. We say that   is a strong critical point of a viscosity solution of (HJ ) if 0  ( ) + ( , + ( )).
Corollary 3.12. Let  [0, +)   be the singular curve in Theorem 3.3. If is not a strong critical point of , then there exists > 0 such that ( )  0 for all  (0, ].

3.4. Existence of global Lipschitz viscosity solution of (HJ ). We assume = ( , )   ×    is a function of class 2 satisfying:
(L1') ( , ) is strictly convex for all   . (L2') There exist 1, 2  0 and two superlinear functions 1, 2  [0, +)  [0, +) such that
2(| |) + 2  ( , )  1(| |) - 1, ( , )   ×  .
The associated Hamiltonian   ×  ×    is defined by

( , ) = sup{ ,  - ( , )},


( , ) × .

Theorem 3.13. Suppose   ×    satisfies (L1')-(L2') and > 0. Then there exists 0     such that 0 is the unique bounded and Lipschitz viscosity solution of (HJ ) on  .

Remark 3.14. In Theorem 3.3, we suppose     is a globally Lipschitz continuous viscosity solution of equation (HJ ). Actually, the viscosity solutions of equation (HJ ) are not always globally Lipschitz continuous. There is a counterexample as follows:

For any function     and > 0, we define the Lax-Oleinik operator (See [10])

Lemma 3.16. There exists positive constants 1 = 1 , 2 = ( 2(0) + 2) such that

- 1  -(- 1)( )  2,  > 0,   .

Proof. On the one hand, for any > 0,   , consider the curve ( )  in (3.4), then we obtain that

-(- 1)( )  - - 1 + 0 ( - ) ( , 0)  0 ( - ) ( 2(0) + 2)  2(0) + 2 = 2.
On the other hand, let  0,, be a minimizer for (3.4). It follows that

Lemma 3.18. Suppose     is bounded on  . Then is a weak-KAM solution of (HJ ) if and only if is a viscosity solution of (HJ ).

Proof of Theorem 3.13. Due to Lemma 3.16, we have that

and -(- 1) is non-decreasing for > 0 by (1) and (4) of Lemma 3.15. It follows that  1-(- 1) - (- 1)  1 + 2. Using Lemma 3.15 (3), we obtain that for any  ,

APPENDIX A. REGULARITY PROPERTIES OF FUNDAMENTAL SOLUTIONS

Here we collect some relevant regularity results with respect to the fundamental solution of (HJ ). The proofs of these regularity results are similar to those in [4] in autonomous case.

Proposition A.1. Suppose L satisfies condition (L1)-(L3). Then for any

Now, for ( , )  [0, +) ×  , > 0 and > 0, let

( , , ) = {( , )   ×   < < + , | - | < ( - )}.

Proposition A.2. Suppose L satisfies condition (L1)-(L3).Then for any fixed > 0, > 0 and > 0, there exists 0( , , , , ) > 0 such that for any ( , )  [0, ] ×  (0, )

(1) The function ( , )  , ( , ) is semiconcave on the cone ( , , 0( , , )) and there

exists 0( , , ) > 0 such that for all ( , )

Moreover, ( , , ) is continuous with respect to .

Remark A.3. In this paper, for any fixed > 0, we choose = 2( ) and = 2( ) , where 2( ) is defined in Lemma 2.6. Assume that  (0, 0, ), then by Lemma 2.6 and the definition of ( , , ), we can let 0( , , , ) = - and ( , , ) only depends on for
= 1, 2, 3. Moreover, if we consider the domain [0, ] ×  ( 0, ) for any 0   , then ( , , ) only depends on initial point 0 and for = 1, 2, 3.

Proposition A.4. Suppose L satisfies condition (L1)-(L3). Then for any fixed > 0, > 0, > 0 and ( , )  [0, ] ×  (0, ), the function ( , )  , ( , ) is of class 1,1 on the cone ( , , 0( , , )), where 0( , , ) is that in Proposition A.2. Moreover, we have

Therefore  1, 2 is compact and the infimum in (2.3) is attained, i.e., ( , 1, 2, )  . Moreover, due to (B.1), for any  1, 2, ( , 1, 2, ), we have
| - 1, 2, |  1( 2 - 1). For item (2), A similar result holds for the sup-convolution defined in (2.4).

Proof of Lemma 2.6. Set ( , )  (0, ] ×  is a differentiable point of . Due to Proposition 2.1 and Proposition 2.5, the solution of (2.2) with terminal condition

()= ()= (, )

is the unique minimizer for ( , ). Lemma 2.2 (1) implies | (0) - |  1( , Lip[ 0]) . Now, denote that

( ) = ( , ( ), ( )),

 [0, ].

By Lemma 2.3, we know that (0)  - 0( (0)). This implies | (0)|  Lip [ 0] and (0) = (0, (0), (0))   (| (0)|) +   (Lip ( 0)) + .
Notice that

( )=

APPENDIX C. PROOF OF LEMMA 3.8

We define   × [0, ]   as:

( , ) = ( ),  [0, +),

where  [0, +)   is that in Theorem 2.9. Similar to [8, Lemma 2.1], ( , ) has the properties (a), (b) and (c) stated in Lemma 3.8.
Due to Theorem 3.3, ( ) is a locally Lipschitz curve. Thus, to prove that ( , ) = ( ) is continuous, it remains to show ( ) is continuous with respect to . We prove it in Lemma C.2.

Lemma C.1. For any fixed   and > 0, let , > 0 be defined in Lemma 2.8. Then for any 0 < < < with -  , , the map  , , is Lipschitz on ( , 2( ) , ) with Lipschitz constant 1( , ) which only depends on , .

Proof. For any 1, 2 with | 1- 2| <

unique maximizers of

1) and

2(

, , 1 and , , 2 the 1, ) is uniformly

convex in the ball ( 1, 2 2( ) , ) with convexity constant 2( , ) for  (0, ).Then we
