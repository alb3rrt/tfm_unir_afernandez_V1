Abstract
We compute the group of automorphisms of an arbitrary ind-variety of (possibly isotropic) generalized flags. Such an ind-variety is a homogeneous ind-space for one of the ind-groups SL(), O() or Sp(). We show that the respective automorphism groups are much larger than SL(), O() or Sp(), and present the answer in terms of Mackey groups. The latter are groups of automorphisms of nondegenerate pairings of (in general infinite-dimensional) vector spaces. An explicit matrix form of the automorphism group of an arbitrary ind-variety of generalized flags is also given. The case of the Sato grassmannian is considered in detail, and its automorphism group is the projectivization of the connected component of unity in the group Japanese GL().

Introduciton

Given a homogenous space X, it is a natural problem to compute its automorphism group Aut X.

In the case when X is a complex flag variety, that is, X = G/P for a connected reductive complex

algebraic group and a parabolic subgroup P  G, the automorphism group of X is well known.

Moreover, it is a classical result that here the connected component Aut0 X of the identity equals the

projectivized group P G, except in some special cases as described in [O].

In this paper, we would like to pose and solve the problem of computing Aut X for a class of

homogeneous ind-varieties X. This is the class of ind-varieties of generalized flags introduced by that

name in [DP] but also considered earlier in several works, see for instance [DPW], [NRW]. These

ind-varieties can be defined simply as G/P where G is one of the ind-groups SL() = -lim SL(n),

SO() = which the

il-nimterSsOec(tnio)n, sSPp(S)L=(nl-i)m, PSp(S2nO)(2ann)d,

P P

is 

a splitting parabolic subgroup, i.e., a SO(2n + 1), P  Sp(2n) are parabolic

subgroup for subgroups of

SL(n), SO(2n), SO(2n + 1), Sp(2n) for all n, respectively. The definition from [DP] can be considered

as a flag realization of the ind-varieties G/P as above, and is recalled in Section 1 below. The main

idea of that approach is that one designates certain chains of subspaces in the natural representation

V of SL() as generalized flags, and then defines an ind-variety of generalized flags as the ind-variety

of generalized flags which differ only "slightly" from a fixed generalized flag W in V . The exact

definition see in Section 1. One then shows that the so obtained ind-variety is isomorphic to G/P for

G = SL() and some splitting parabolic subgroup P  G.

An ind-grassmannian is an ind-variety of generalized flags for which the fixed generalized flag

consists of a single proper subspace W  V . For dim W = codim V W =  the ind-grassmannian is

isomorphic to the Sato grassmannian. This has been pointed out for instance in [GS].

In the cases of the groups SO() and Sp() we consider ind-varieties of isotropic generalized

flags, as stated in Section 3.

Our main result is the explicit determination of the group Aut X for an arbitrary ind-variety of,

possibly isotropic, generalized flags. A notable feature is that the answer is very different form the

ind-groups P GL(), P O(), or P Sp(), and we present it in terms of Mackey groups. Such a

group is defined in terms of a nondegenerate pairing of vector spaces T × R  C, and is a subgroup of

the group of all linear operators  : T  T for which the dual operator  determines a well-defined

1

automorphism  : R  R. This definition of Mackey group is inspired by G. Mackey's dissertation [M]. If T and R are finite dimensional, then the Mackey group is nothing but GL(T )  GL(R). The group known as Japanese GL() is a Mackey group and plays a crusial role in our work. In the Appendix we discuss the structure of this group in detail.
The precise statement of our main result, Theorem 1.1, is presented in Section 1. The consideration of the isotropic case is postponed to Section 7. The proof of Theorem 1.1 is divided into two parts: the case of an ind-grassmannian and the case of an arbitrary generalized flag. For the Sato grassmannian (which is the most interesting ind-grassmannian) our result implies that its automorphism group is isomorphic to the projectivization of the connected component of the identity in the group Japanese GL(). In Section 6 we give a matrix realization of the group of automorphisms of an arbitrary ind-variety of generalized flags. In the isotropic case such a realization is given in Corollary 7.2.
We would like to point out that Aut X depends essentially on the ind-variety X, despite the fact that all X are homogeneous spaces for the same group SL() (or, respectively, SO(), Sp()). This is in contrast with the finite-dimensional case in which the connected component of the identity in the automorphism group of a variety SL(n)/P (respectively, SO(2n)/P , SO(2n + 1)/P or Sp(2n)/P ) depends only on n and not on the choice of P . Further research should be carried out to compare the isomorphism classes of ind-varieties of generalized flags with the isomorphism classes of automorphism groups of ind-varieties of generalized flags.
Our possible application of the results of the present paper would be the study of locally reductive ind-groups G different from G = SL(), SO(), Sp() for which G/P is a homogeneous G-space.
In conclusion of this short introduction, we should mention that some particular cases of the automorphism groups of ind-varieties of generalized flags have been considered in [P] and [T].

1. Brief background and statement of the main result
The ground field is C. If R is a vector space, we set GL(R) = {  HomC(R, R) |  is invertible} and R = HomC(R, C). We also use the superscript · to denote the dual of a vector bundle, as well as the pullback functor for vector bundles along a morphism of varieties. In what follows we consider infinite matrices, in particular, infinite rows and columns. We call such matrices, rows or columns finitary if they have at most finitely many nonzero entries. By · C we denote the linear span over C.
We fix a countable-dimensional vector space V . A chain of subspaces W = {W} is a set of subspaces W  V , parameterized by some index set with elements  such that for  =  we have W W or W W. The relation of inclusion induces a total order on the set of indices of a chain. A chain of subspaces W = {W} is a generalized flag in V if every index  has either an immediate predecessor or an immediate successor, and every nonzero vector v of V is contained in some difference W \ W, where  is the immediate successor of . For a more detailed discussion of generalized flags, and for an introduction to ind-varieties of generalized flags, see, e.g., [DP], [IP] and [PT2].
We say that a generalized flag W is compatible with a basis E of V (or that W is E-compatible) if any space W of W is spanned by elements of E, i.e., W = W E C for any . We set E = E W. Then E is a basis of W. By (W) we denote the span of the system of linear functions E dual to the basis E. We have (W)  W. We also let V equal the span of the system of linear functions dual to the basis E. The group GL(E, V ) is the subgroup of GL(V ) consisting of all invertible operators  : V  V each of which acts as the identity on all but finitely elements of E.
2

In what follows, we fix a basis E and a generalized flag W in V compatible with E. The set F l(W, E, V ) is the set of all generalized flags W  = {W } which are E-commensurable with W . This latter requirement spells out as the following three conditions for each element W  of F l(W, E, V ):

· the index set which parameterizes the generalized flag W  is the same as the index set of W ;
· there exists a finite-dimensional subspace Z V depending on W , such that for any  we have W + Z = W + Z and dim(W  Z) = dim(W  Z);
· the generalized flag W  is compatible with a basis E of V , depending on W , such that E differs from E by finitely many vectors.

The set F l(W, E, V ) has a natural structure of ind-variety. This is explained in detail in [DP] (and
in [IP] and [PT2]). Briefly, the ind-variety structure on F l(W, E, V ) arises as follows. Enumerate the basis E by the set Z>0 and put Vi := e1, . . . , ei C for i  Z>0. Each intersection W  Vi is a flag in Vi of certain type di = (d1i , . . . , dki i), and this ordering of the basis E induces embeddings

F l(di, Vi) - F l(di+1, Vi+1),

(1)

called strict standard extensions, such that F l(W, E, V ) = -lim F l(di, Vi). The embeddings (1) endow F l(W, E, V ) with an ind-variety structure. In Section 3 below we recall the definition of a strict
standard extension.
Next we recall that if T and R are two (in general, infinite-dimensional) vector spaces endowed with a non-degenerate pairing p : T × R  C, then the Mackey group G(T, R) is defined as

G(T, R) = {  GL(T ) | (R) = R},

(2)

see [M]. Here  : T   T  is the operator dual (adjoint) to the operator  : T  T , and R is considered as a subspace of T  via the embedding R  T  induced by the pairing p. Equivalently,
G(T, R) can be defined as the group

{  GL(R) | (T ) = T }

(3)

where T is considered as a subspace of R via p. The correspondence

  (|R)-1

is a canonical isomorphism between the groups (2) and (3). In what follows, when writing   G(T, R)

we will assume that   GL(T ), and will denote the operator |R by . Note that, given a subspace A of T , one has (A) = -1(A), where A is the annihilator of A in R.

Consider

again

the

ind-variety

of

generalized

flags

F l(W, E, V ).

Define

the

spaces

VW
E

and

VWE

as

VEW := (((W))  U) ,

VWE := ((W)  U) ,


where  runs over the indices parameterizing the generalized flag W , and the spaces U are direct complements of the spaces W, i.e., V = W  U, with the assumption that U  E is a basis of U. Note that there is a natural non-degenerate pairing

VEW × VWE  C,

3

therefore the group G(V W , V W ) is well-defined. Moreover, GL(E, V ) is a subgroup of G(V W , V W ).

E E

E E

To see this, the reader will check that for any linear operator  : V  V ,   GL(E, V ), the dual

operator  : V   V  has V W as an invariant space, and the double dual operator  : V   V 

E

has V W as an invariant space. Therefore, this allows to consider  as an element of G(V W , V W ).

E

E E

Another essential observation is that the spaces V W and V W depend only on the ind-variety

E

E

F l(W, E, V ) and not on the choice of point W  F l(W, E, V ). This follows from the fact that, for

each , the spaces ((W))  U and (W)  U do not change when W is replaced by a subspace W  W which is E-commensurable with W, and U is replaced by a direct complement U of W

containing all but finitely many vectors from E  U.

Next, if W  is any chain of subspaces in V and  : V W  V W is any linear operator from the

then

of the spaces W , and similarly -1

W 

, W  are chains in V W  V .
E

In what follows, we use the notation W  for chains perpendicular to W  also in appropriate

subspaces of V  different from VWE and indicate the respective subspace as necessary. A similar convention applies to the notation W . Moreover, we call the generalized flag W symmetric if the

chain W   V is the image of W under a linear isomorphism V  V sending E to E.

Theorem 1.1.

a) If W is not symmetric, then the group Aut F l(W, E, V ) is isomorphic to P (GL(E, V ) · StW ),

b) If W is symmetric, then the group Aut F l(W, E, V ) is isomorphic to P (GL(E, V ) · StW )  Z2.

In Section 6 we present an explicit matrix realization of the group GL(E, V ) · StW . Let's also point out that, since Theorem 1.1 implies that GL(E, V ) · StW is a group, we have GL(E, V ) · StW = StW · GL(E, V ).
Remark 1.2. In the case of a finite-dimensional flag variety X, every automorphism of X belonging to the connected component of unity in the automorphism group has a fixed point on X. This no longer holds in the generality of Theorem 1.1. Indeed, if X is the projective ind-space F l(W, E, V ) for dim W = 1, then AutX = P GL(V ) and it is well known that not every invertible linear automorphism of V has an eigenvector.

2. Examples
Before we embark on proving Theorem 1.1, we present five examples in which we compute the respective group GL(E, V ) · StW from Theorem 1.1. In all five cases our claims follow from Theorem 6.1 below, which provides a matrix form of the group GL(E, V ) · StW in the general case.
2.1. The case of an ind-grassmannian. Let's consider the case where the generalized flag W has the form 0 W V , where W is a single proper subspace of V (we slightly abuse notation by using the same letter W for a flag and a subspace). There are three cases: dim W < , or dim W = codim V W = , or codim V W < . If dim W < , then Gr(W, E, V ) does not depend on the basis
4

E, and the points of Gr(W, E, V ) are all subspaces of V of the same dimension as W . In this case we

may write Gr(W, E, V ) = Gr(dim W, V ). If codim V W <  then Gr(W, E, V ) depends as a set on the choice of the basis E, but up to isomorphism Gr(W, E, V ) depends only on codim V W . Moreover, as an ind-variety Gr(W, E, V ) is isomorphic to Gr(codim V W, V ). If dim W = codim V W = , the ind-variety Gr(W, E, V ) does not depend up to isomorphism on the choice of both W and E. It is

known, see, for instance, [GS], that in this case Gr(W, E, V ) is isomorphic to the Sato grassmannian

introduced in [S].

If dim W < , then V W = V , V W = V  and G(V, V ) = GL(V ). Since W is not symmetric,

E

E

Theorem 1.1 asserts that Aut Gr(W, E, V ) = P (GL(E, V ) · StW ), and we note that in this case

P (GL(E, V ) · StW ) = P GL(V ).

(5)

Indeed, the action of G(V, V ) = GL(V ) on Gr(W, E, V ) via the formula (4) is easily checked to

coincide with the obvious action of GL(V ) on subspaces of V , and the isomorphism (5) is a consequence

of the transitive action of the group GL(E, V ) on finite-dimensional subspaces of fixed dimension in V .

3. More background

We need to recall some facts about linear embeddings of finite-dimensional grassmannians and

flag varieties. If T is a finite-dimensional space and d = {d1, . . . , di} is a vector of positive integers

satisfying dk < dl < dim T for k < l, then F l(d, T ) denotes the variety of all flags of subspaces

T1 . . . Ti T , where dim Tj = dj. If d consists of one integer d, we write simply Gr(d, T ). If T is

endowed with a non-degenerate symmetric or antisymmetric (symplectic) form, we write respectively

F lO(d, T ) and F lS(d, T ) for the varieties of isotropic flags in T with respect to the fixed form. We

also

write

GrO(d, T )

and

GrS(d, T ).

An

isotropic

flag

has

always

length

less

or

equal

dim T 2

but,

for

convenience, in this paper by an isotropic flag we will mean a flag of the form

W1  W2  . . .  Wk  Wk  . . .  Wk,

where the spaces W1, . . . , Wk are isotropic and the spaces Wk, . . . , W1 are coisotropic. All flag varieties F lO(d, T ) and F lS(d, T ) are connected, except GrO(d, T ) for dim T = 2d. In what follows,

by F lO(d, T ) or GrO(d, T ) we always denote a connected component.

The Picard group of any grassmannian or ind-grassmannian Z is isomorphic to Z except in the

case of Gr

dim T 2

- 1,

T

for 2 < dim T  2Z>0, and OZ (1) always denotes the ample generator of

Pic Z. In the case of Gr

dim T 2

T

for 2 < dim T  2Z>0 we have Pic Gr

dim T 2

The automorphism groups of the flag varieties F l(d, T ), F lO(d, T ), F lS(d, T ) have been known

for long time. The fact that the automorphism group of the projective space Pn is P GL(n + 1) goes

back to the nineteenth century. Wei-Liang Chow [C] extended this result to grassmannians in 1949.

For a general flag variety X = F l(d, T ), F lO(d, T ), F lS(d, T ) the connected component of the

identity in the automorphism group Aut X is the respective group P GL(T ), SO(T ), or Sp(T ), except in several cases listed by A.L. Onishchik in [O]. These special cases are GrS(1, T )  P(T ), the five

dimensional quadric GrO(1, T ) for dim T = 7, and GrO

dim T 2

-1

,

T

for dim T  2Z>0 + 1.

In all cases, see for instance [A, Section 3.3], the full automorphism group G is always a semidirect

product of its connected component of unity G0 and a finite group of automorphisms of the Dynkin

diagram of the Lie algebra g = Lie G0 which keep fixed the simple roots of the Lie algebra of the

isotropy subgroup of a point on the respective flag variety. In the present paper we only consider

classical groups of large enough rank, hence we can summarize the relevant part of this result as

A nice class of embeddings of flag varieties F l(d1, T1)  F l(d2, T2) for dim T1 < dim T2 is the class of standard extensions. Embeddings of ind-grassmannians are discussed in detail in [PT1], and of

arbitrary flag varieties in [PT2]. Here we just recall a definition and a basic fact needed to understand

our arguments in Section 4, 5, 7.

Definition 3.1.

a) An embedding

 : F l(d11, . . . , dk1, T )  F l(d12, . . . , dl2, T ),

respectively,

 : F lO(d11, . . . , dk1, T )  F lO(d12, . . . , dl2, T ),

respectively,

 : F lS(d11, . . . , dk1 , T )  F lS(d12, . . . , dl2, T )

is a strict standard extension if there exists a surjection

p : {0, 1, . . . , l, l + 1}  {0, 1, . . . , k, k + 1}

satisfying p(i)  p(j) for i < j, together with an isomorphism

V = V W,

(7)

satisfying W = V  in the orthogonal and symplectic case, and with a flag 0  W1  . . .  Wk~  W containing also the spaces Wi for 1  i  k~, such that  has the form

 0  Vp(1)  . . .  Vp(l)  V = 0  Vp(1)  W1  . . .  Vp(l)  Wl  V  .

(8)

b) An embedding

 : F l(d11, . . . , dk1, T ) - F l(d12, . . . , dl2, T )

is a standard extension if after composing with one of the duality isomorphisms

F l(d11, . . . , dk1, T )  F l(dim T - dk1, . . . , dim T - d11, T ),
F l(d12, . . . , dl2, T )  F l(dim T  - dl2, . . . , dim T  - d12, T )  becomes a strict standard extension. For varieties of isotropic flags, standard extension and strict standard extension are synonyms.

The following theorem follows directly from Corollary 4.4 in [PT2]. Theorem 3.2. Let X1  X2 and Y1  Y2 be embeddings of flag varieties or of isotropic flag varieties, such that Y1 is the image of X1 under some isomorphism  : X2  Y2. Then the embedding Y1  Y2 is a standard extension whenever the embedding X1  X2 is a standard extension. We need to recall also the notion of an ind-variety of isotropic generalized flags. There are several cases. If a symmetric non-degenerate form (·, ·) on V is given, then there are two types of relevant bases E we consider:
{ei}iZ with (ei, e-i) = 1 for all i, (ei, ek) = 0 for k = -i,

7

or

{ei}iZ\{0} with (ei, e-i) = 1 for all i  Z>0, (ei, ek) = 0 for k = -i.

(9)

In the case of a symplectic non-degenerate form on V , we consider bases satisfying (9) (here (e-i, ei) = -1 for i  Z>0). We refer to bases as above as isotropic bases of V . An isotropic generalized flag in V is by definition a generalized flag W = {W} in V such that each space W is either isotropic or coisotropic and W belongs to W if and only if W = {w  V | (w, w) = 0 for all w  W} belongs to W . If W is an E-compatible isotropic generalized flag in V , then by definition, F lO(W, E, V )
in the case of a symmetric form, or F lS(W, E, V ) in the case of a symplectic form, consists of all
isotropic generalized flags in V which are E-commensurable with W . In all cases, F lO(W, E, V )
or, respectively, F lS(W, E, V ) is a direct limit of finite-dimensional varieties of isotropic flags under
standard extensions.

4. Proof of Theorem 1.1 for ind-grassmannians

We start by proving Theorem 1.1 under the assumption that the generalized flag W has exactly one

proper subspace, which we also denote by W . In what follows, we write most of the time Gr(W, E, V )

instead of Gr(W, E, V ), where E = E W . The set E is a basis of W , and the ind-variety Gr(W, E, V )

depends only on E and not on the entire basis E. We feel that this notation makes the argument more

transparent.

Also,

the

space

W

is

fixed

and

we

write

VE

and

VE

instead

of

VW
E

and

VWE ,

respectively.

Recall that Gr(W, E, V ) is defined as the direct limit of strict standard extensions

Gr(dn, Vn) - Gr(dn+1, Vn+1)

for some dn and some subspaces Vn  V , dim Vn n, l-im Vn = V . If dn stabilizes at k  Z>0 for large n, then l-im Gr(dn, Vn) = Gr(k, V ) is the ind-grassmannian of all k-dimensional subspaces in V . If dim Vn - dn stabilizes at k > 0, then Gr(W, E, V ) is isomorphic to Gr(k, V ) as an ind-variety via the map
 : Gr(W, E, V )  Gr(k, V),
W  - W   V,
where W  denotes a variable point of Gr(W, E, V ) and W  := {  V | (w) = 0  w  W }. As we already mentioned, the automorphism groups of (finite-dimensional) grassmannians have
been described in the classical paper [C]. This description implies that if

 : Gr(dn, Tn)  Gr(dn, Tn )

(10)

is any isomorphism of grassmannians, where dim Tn = dim Tn , then the pullback Sn of the tautological bundle Sn on Gr(dn, Tn ) is isomorphic to the tautological bundle Sn on Gr(dn, Tn), or to the bundle (Tn/Sn) in case 2dn = n, where Tn is the trivial bundle on Gr(dn, Tn) with fiber Tn. Moreover, if Sn  Sn, then the isomorphism (10) is determined by the linear operator  : (Tn )  Tn which it induces via pullback: we have (Tdn ) = (Tdn ) where Tdn  Gr(dn, Tn) and the operator  is dual to . Recall also that any global endomorphism of the bundle Sn or (T /Sn) is scalar.
Set Xn = Gr(dn, Vn). Then Gr(W, E, V ) = -lim Xn. In the rest of the argument we assume in addition that dim W = codim V W =  and that dn = n, dim Vn = 2n. This is the case of
the Sato grassmannian. The remaining cases where dim W <  or codim V W <  have been considered in [P], and it has been proved there that Aut Gr(W, E, V ) = P GL(V ) for dim W < , and Aut Gr(W, E, V ) = P GL(V) for codim W < . This is in agreement with Theorem 1.1, as in these two cases W is not symmetric and there is an isomorphism

GL(E, V ) · StW =

GL(V ) for dim W <  GL(V) for codim V W < .

(11)

We leave the proof of (11) as an exercise to the reader.
Our first step will be to prove that the group of automorphisms of the ind-variety Gr(W, E, V ) is a subgroup of P (GL(E, V ) · StW )  Z2. Let  : Gr(W, E, V )  Gr(W, E, V ) be an arbitrary automorphism. Denote by Yn the image of Xn, that is, (Xn) = Yn. Clearly, Yn is a grassmannian isomorphic to Xn. Moreover, the embeddings Yn  Yn+1 can be assumed to be strict standard extensions by Theorem 3.2.
Next, we have two possibilities: for some n, the isomorphism

n := |Xn : Xn - Yn

has the property

nSYn =


Vn/Sn ,

(12)

where Sn is the tautological bundle on Xn and SYn is the tautological bundle on Yn, or the property

nSYn = Sn

(13)

for all n. Since our chains of embeddings Xn  Xn+1 and Yn  Yn+1 are strict standard extensions, if the isomorphism (12) holds for some n, it must hold for all n. However, if this happens we can compose our automorphism  with the following automorphism which represents an element of Z2 in the semidirect product from the statement of the theorem:

 : Gr(W, E, V ) - Gr(W , E, V) - Gr(W, E, V ),

where the left arrow sends W to W   V and the right arrow is induced by an appropriate linear isomorphism
V - V

which maps W  to W . Option (13) certainly holds for the composition   , so without loss of

generality we can assume in the rest of the argument that (13) holds.

The latter assumption implies

nSYn = Sn

(14)

for all n. We write equality, as such an isomorphism is determined up to a scalar cn, and we assume that the scalars cn are chosen in a way compatible with the restriction maps

nSYn |Xn-1

n-1 SYn-1

Sn |Xn-1

Sn-1.

Then, by our above remark that isomorphisms of grassmannians are encoded by linear operators, the isomorphisms n : Xn  Yn are recovered by a choice of compatible invertible linear operators
n : (Vn) = H0(Yn, SYn)  H0(Xn, Sn) = Vn.
The operators n are dual to unique operators n = (n) : Vn  Vn which we will also consider. Since both chains of embeddings Xn  Xn+1 and Yn  Yn+1 are strict standard extensions, we
have l-im Vn = V = l-im Vn, and consequently, lim-(Vn) = V  = lim- Vn. Therefore, the operators n induce a linear operator
: V   V ,
and more precisely, a commutative diagram

The diagram (15) encodes the automorphism  in the following way. Let W  = l-im(W   Vn) be a point of Gr(W, E, V ). Then

(W ) = -lim n(W   Vn) = -lim (n)-1 (W   Vn)  ,

(16)

where the orthogonal to W   Vn is taken in Vn and the orthogonal to (n)-1 (W   Vn) is taken

in Vn.

Next, it is essential to observe that the subspace VE  V  is nothing but the subspace of global

sections µ is a linear

of the sheaf function on

Wlim-

Sn satisfying the which belongs to

condition: the value the subspace W 

of µ W .

at any point W   Gr(W, E, V ) Here W is defined in terms of

a basis of W  which differs from E by finitely many vectors (W is the span of the system of linear

functionals dual to such a basis). Note that, for each W   Gr(W, E, V ), the subspace W  W 

is determined solely by the set Gr(W, E, V ), and hence the above subspace of global sections µ, i.e.,

the space VE, must be invariant under the operator . Next, the subspace VE is the counterpart of the space VE for the ind-grassmannian Gr(W , E, V), where V is defined by the fixed extension E of E to a basis of V , and E are the linear functions in E which do not vanish on W . Since

Gr(W , E, V) is isomorphic to Gr(W, E, V ), the space VE is also invariant under the linear map  : (V)  (V) induced by the automorphism  of Gr(W, E, V ). Moreover, given , the linear operator  is nothing but the dual operator  restricted to the subspace (V) of V .

We have shown that any automorphism  : Gr(W, E, V )  Gr(W, E, V ) satisfying (13) induces

a pair of invertible operators  := |VE : VE  VE and  := |VE : VE  VE which determine an element of the Mackey group G(VE, VE ). Moreover, if Aut0Gr(W, E, V ) stands for the group

of automorphisms of the ind-variety Gr(W, E, V ) satisfying (13), then the assignment  - , or

equivalently  - -1, defines an injective group homomorphism

 : Aut0Gr(W, E, V )  P G(VE, VE ).

We now check that the action of the image in P G(VE, VE) of Aut0Gr(W, E, V ) is given by the

formula

 W

= -1

W 


 V,

where W   VE and -1 W    (VE) (clearly, V  (VE)). To do this, recall that (W ) is given by formula (16). Therefore, we need to verify that

l-im (n)-1 W   Vn   = -1 lim- W   Vn    V.

(17)

10

However, formula (17) follows from the observation that both its left-hand and right-hand sides coin-
cide with the subspace of vectors in V which vanish on (n)-1 (W   Vn) whenever they belong to Vn; we consider here vectors in Vn as linear functions on Vn.
In conclusion, the image of Aut0Gr(W, E, V ) in P G(VE , VE) is a subgroup of P G(VE, VE ) which acts on Gr(W, E, V ) via the formula (17). Next, we note that since GL(E, V ) acts transitively on Gr(W, E, V ), for any   Aut0Gr(W, E, V ) there are   GL(E, V ) and W  Aut0Gr(W, E, V ) such that W (W ) = W and  =   W . Indeed if (W ) = W  for W   Gr(W, E, V ), then  = -1     where   GL(E, V ) satisfies (W ) = W . Consequently,  = -1W for W  StW , in other words,
the image of  lies in P (GL(E, V ) · StW ).
To complete the proof, we need to show that any operator   GL(E, V ) · StW determines a welldefined automorphism of Gr(W, E, V ). In the Appendix we introduce the degree d() of an operator  and show that the space · W  = -1(W )  V is E-commensurable with W for any   G(VE , VE) such that d() = 0. Denote by G0(VE, VE ) the group of all operators   G(VE, VE) with d() = 0.
We have to convince ourselves that the action of G0(VE, VE ) on Gr(W, E, V ) is by automorphisms of ind-varieties, and not merely by bijections of the set Gr(W, E, V ). Let V = W U where EU spans
U . Recall that our fixed nested finite-dimensional spaces V1  . . .  Vn  Vn+1  . . . are spanned by elements of E and Gr(W, E, V ) = l-im Gr(dn, Vn) where dn = dim Vn  W . The embeddings Xn = Gr(dn, Vn)  Gr(dn+1, Vn+1) = Xn+1 are strict standard extensions

Fdn - Fdn  Wn|n+1,

where Wn+1 = W  Vn+1 = Wn  Wn|n+1 for Wn = W  Vn, and Wn|n+1  E spans Wn|n+1. Therefore we have a decomposition VE = W n  Vn  Un, where W n is the E-compatible direct complement of Vn within W + Vn and Un is the dual of the E-compatible direct complement Un of W + Vn in V . Any invertible linear operator  : VE  VE induces a decomposition
VE = (W n)  (Vn)  (Un),

and hence an operator

n : Vn := VE /(W n  Un) - VE /((W n)  (Un)) = n(Vn).

Moreover, we have  = lim- n |VE . Each linear operator n induces an isomorphism of grassmannians

Gr(dn, n(Vn)) - Gr(dn, Vn),

and the varieties Gr(dn, n(Vn)) form an ind-variety isomorphic to Gr(W, E, V ). We conclude that, if

l-im Set

Gr(dn, n(Vn)) = Gr(W, E, now  := -1 for   G0(VE

V ) then  induces , VE). Then n =

an automorphism of the ind-variety Gr(W, E, V ). (n)-1 and n(Vn) = n(Vn). By the above men-

tioned result from the Appendix, we know that  · W   Gr(W, E, V ) whenever   G0(VE, VE)

and W   Gr(W, E, V ). P G0(VE, VE )  im .

Therefore l-im Gr(dn, n(Vn)) = Gr(W, E, V ), and we have shown that

Finally, Theorem A.7 (i) from the Appendix implies that StW  G0(VE, VE), and hence that also

GL(E, V ) · StW  G0(VE, VE). Consequently, GL(E, V ) · StW = G0(VE, VE) and GL(E, V ) · StW is

a group. In particular, GL(E, V )) · StW = StW · GL(E, V )). The proof is now complete as we have

shown that im  = P (GL(E, V ) · StW ).

Corollary 4.1. If dim W = codim V W = , the group AutGr(W, E, V ) is isomorphic to projec-

tivization of the connected component of unity in the group Japanese GL().

Proof. We proved that AutGr(W, E, V ) = P G0(VE, VE). As pointed out in the Appendix, the

group G0(VE, VE) is isomorphic to the connected component of unity in the group Japanese GL().

5. Proof of Theorem 1.1 in the general case

Step 1. Reduction to the case of an automorphism which preserves all inverse limits of dual tautological bundles. Consider the ind-variety F l(W, E, V ) for our fixed generalized flag W = {W} compatible with the fixed basis E of V . Fix an exhaustion of F l(W, E, V ) as a direct limit -lim F l(dn, Vn) of strict standard extensions of finite-dimensional flag varieties F l(dn, Vn). If the generalized flag W is symmetric, then the exhaustion can be chosen so that each flag variety F l(dn, Vn) is symmetric, i.e., the vector (d0n = 0, d1n, d2n, . . . , dsn, dsn+1 = dim Vn) satisfies the condition
din - din-1 = dns+2-i - dns+1-i

for all 1  s  n + 1. If W is not symmetric, then infinitely many vectors dn are not symmetric, so (by

passing to a subsequence of the sequence {n}) we can assume that all vectors dn are not symmetric.

Let  : F l(W, E, V )  F l(W, E, V ) be an automorphism. Set Xn := F l(dn, Vn) and let Yn =

(Xn). The varieties are finite-dimensional flag varieties, and there are fixed isomorphisms n := |Xn : Xn  Yn. Moreover, Theorem 3.2 implies that the embeddings Yn  Yn+1 are standard

extensions. By replacing Yn or Yn+1 by its dual flag variety we can further assume that the embeddings

Yn  Yn+1 are strict standard extensions. Denote by Snj and SYjn the tautological bundles of rank djn on Xn and Yn, respectively. There are
two possibilities: either

nSYj n  Snj

(18)

for all n, or

nSYj n  (Vn/Sns+1-j )

(19)

for some n = n0 and all j, 1 < j s. Case (19) can occur only if the vector dn0 is symmetric. Moreover, then (19) will necessarily hold for all n > n0 due to the assumption that all embeddings

Xn  Xn+1 and Yn  Yn+1 are strict standard extensions. In that case, we may as well assume that (19) holds for all n.

Similarly to the case of an ind-grassmannian, if (19) holds for all n we can compose  with an

automorphism

 : F l(W, E, V ) - F l(W , E, V) - F l(W, E, V )

which maps W first to W  and then maps W  to a point of F l(W, E, V ) under the isomorphism F l(W , E, V) - F l(W, E, V ) induced by an appropriate linear isomorphism V  V mapping E to E. Then the composition    satisfies the condition (18) for all n. Therefore, in order to prove Theorem 1.1, it suffices to prove that

Aut0F l(W, E, V )  P (GL(E, V ) · StW )

where Aut0F l(W, E, V ) denotes the group of automorphisms of F l(W, E, V ) satisfying (18) for all n. Step 2. From automorphisms to linear operators. Since (18) holds, the automorphism

 : F l(W, E, V )  F l(W, E, V )

induces automorphisms

 : Gr(W, E, V )  Gr(W, E, V )

(20)

for each subspace W in W . In turn, the automorphisms (20) induce linear operators, defined up to
scalar multiples,  : V   V 

as explained in Section 4.

12

We now point out that the operators  can be chosen to coincide, i.e., to define a single operator
:V V
not depending on . This observation is justified as follows. Denote by S the pullback to F l(W, E, V ) of the inverse limit of the tautological bundles Sn on Gr(W, E, V ). Let  <  be two indices in the chain W = {W}. Then the morphism of inverse limits S  S, arising from the respective morphism of inverse systems, induces a commutative diagram

The fact that GL(E, V ) acts transitively on F l(W, E, V ) shows, by the same argument as in Section 4,

that the image of  lies in the subset P

GL(E, V ) · StW

We have to show that  is injective, i.e., that the image of  determines all operators  and  as

in the Appendix. The key point is that if an invertible operator on VEW admits such a matrix, then

this matrix is unique. for  <  imply that

is injective according to Section 4, we conclude that  is injective.
Step 4. The image of . As a final step of the proof, we need to show that the image of  coincides
with the set P (GL(E, V ) · StW ). For this it suffices to prove that P (GL(E, V ) · StW ) belongs to the
image of , i.e., that GL(E, V ) · StW acts on the ind-variety F l(W, E, V ) via the formula (4). Pick an operator   GL(E, V ) · StW and a flag W   F l(W, E, V ). Since W and W  are E-
commensurable, one has GL(E, V ) · StW = GL(E, V ) · StW . Therefore  = -1W  for some W   StW  and some   GL(E, V ). Consequently, (W ) = -1(W ), i.e. -1(W ) is E-commensurable
with W . In conclusion, im = P (GL(E, V ) · StW ), and since (GL(E, V ) · StW ) is a group we have
also im = P (StW · GL(E, V )). The proof is complete.

6. An explicit matrix form of the group GL(E, V ) · StW

Now we would like to characterize the product GL(E, V ) · StW in terms of matrices. We start by describing a matrix form of the group StW .
Choose a linear order on E such that ej  W \ W , ek  W for  <  implies k < j. It follows from the Appendix that for each space W the stabilizer of W in G VEW, VWE under the action
(4) can be represented by infinite matrices (with rows and columns ordered by the fixed order on E) which, together with their inverses, have the form

AB 0D

(23)

where A has finitary rows, D has finitary columns, and there are no restrictions on the rows and
columns of B. Certainly, the splitting (23) depends on the space W. Next, the fact that the operators  and  form a system compatible with the inclusions VEW 
VEW, VWE  VWE for  < , implies that all operators , respectively , are represented by the same matrix. This means that all matrices (23) are just one matrix which satisfies the above
conditions for all spaces W. Consequently, StW consists of matrices M which, together with their inverses, have the form

14

M

=

 

... 0
0

A 0

...

  ,

(24)

the rows and columns of M being ordered by the ordered set which orders the elements of E as above,
and the diagonal blocks being of size dim(W2/W1 ) × dim(W2/W1 ) where  is one of the indices
1 and 2, and 1 is the immediate predecessor of 2. This datum induces a block structure on the entire matrix M , and all strictly lower-triangular blocks are set to equal zero. Furthermore, since M and M -1 are subject to the above additional conditions for all splittings arising from spaces W of W , the matrices M and M -1 satisfy the following:

· if there exists a rightmost highest block L (this depends on the order on E, i.e., ultimately on the structure of the generalized flag W ), then there are no conditions on the rows and columns of L, all columns of M which intersect L have at most finitely many nonzero entries outside of L, all rows of L which intersect L have at most finitely many nonzero entries outside of L, and all other rows and columns of M have at most finitely many nonzero entries in the region in which the first index is greater then the first index of any entry of L and the second index is smaller than the second index of any entry of L;

· if M has no rightmost highest block, then all rows have at most finitely many nonzero entries in direction to the left (from any point on) and all columns have at most finitely many nonzero entries in the downward direction (from any point on).

In order to pass to the full group GL(E, V ) · StW , consider matrices of the form (24) and replace the zeros in the lower-triangular part by finitely many nonzero entries. Let's refer to such matrices as W -aligned. If M is a W -aligned matrix, then every space W induces a splitting of M into four blocks

AB CD

(25)

where C is a finitary matrix. A W -aligned matrix M is eligible if M -1 is also W -aligned, and for any

 the splittings

AB CD

and

A B C D

of M and M -1 respectively, satisfy the condition

rk C = rk C.

We leave it as an exercise to the reader to check that the condition of eligibility is empty (i.e., it is automatically satisfied) if the ordered set parameterizing the rows and columns of A or D is finite.
Our result in this section states as follows. Theorem 6.1. The group GL(E, V ) · StW is isomorphic to the group of all eligible W -aligned matrices.
Proof. Any matrix in GL(E, V ) · StW has the form Mf M where Mf is an element of GL(E, V ) and M is a matrix from StW having the form (24). The necessary and sufficient condition for Mf M to
lie in GL(E, V ) · StW is that the splitting (25) of Mf M for any space W in W satisfies the condition of Theorem A.7. For all  these conditions amount precisely to the requirement that the matrix Mf M be eligible.

15

7. The isotropic case
Theorem 7.1. Let X = F lO(W, E, V ) or F lS(W, E, V ) for some isotropic generalized flag W compatible with an isotropic basis E of V . We assume in addition that W does not have the form 0  W1  W1  V where dim W1 = 1 in the symplectic case, and that dim W1/W1 = 2 in the orthogonal case if the basis E has the form (9). Then
AutX  P (O(E, V ) · StOW )
or AutX  P (Sp(E, V ) · StSWp),
where StOW and StSWp denote respectively the stabilizer of W in O(V ) and Sp(V ). The action of O(V ) on F lO(W, E, V ), or respectively of Sp(V ) on F lS(W, E, V ), is induced by the linear action of O(V ) or Sp(V ) on V .
Proof. Step 1. The case of an isotropic ind-grassmannian. The argument starts in the same way as for ordinary ind-grassmannians. The embeddings Xn  Xn+1 are assumed to be standard extensions of isotropic grassmannians, and by Theorem 3.2 the embeddings Yn := (Xn) -n Yn+1 := (Xn+1) are also standard extensions.
Next, in the isotropic case the isomorphisms (14) must hold, so we arrive to diagram (15) or, equivalently, to a commutative diagram
V = -l...im Vn l-im n V = -l...im Vn

Vn Vn-1

n n-1

Vn .
Vn-1

...

The isomorphism V = hence any Vn is a subspace

-lim Vn of VN

holds since for some N

the embeddings Yn > n. Furthermore,

 the

Yn+1 are standard extensions, and restriction of the fixed (symmetric

or antisymmetric) form on V to Vn is a form defining the corresponding isotropic grassmannian in

Vn. (Such a form is unique up to a scalar if W satisfies the conditions of the theorem.) Recall (from

Section 4) that the maps n are defined up to compatible scalars cn. The key observation is that

there is a unique choice of these scalars such that the maps n are isomorphisms of orthogonal or,

respectively, symplectic vector spaces. This follows from the fact that the automorphism groups of

our finite-dimensional isotropic grassmannians Xn and Yn are the respective orthogonal or symplectic

groups.

Set

 := l-im n : V  V.

Then by construction  is an orthogonal or, respectively, symplectic operator, and  determines our

automorphism  which acts on a point W  by formula (16). However, in the case considered we have

l-im n W   Vn   = l-im n W   Vn = (W ),

(26)

16

hence the action of  on X is simply induced by the action of  as a linear automorphism of V . This implies that there is an injective homomorphism

 : AutGrO(W, E, V )  P O(V )

or, respectively,

 : AutGrS(W, E, V )  P Sp(V ),

 - 

and that the action of the image of  on GrO(W, E, V ) or GrS(W, E, V ) is induced by the linear
action of O(V ) or, respectively, Sp(V ) on V .
In the case of a general ind-variety of isotropic generalized flags, an injective homomorphism 
is constructed exactly as in Step 3 of the proof of Theorem 1.1. Here the images of all homomor-
phisms  lie in P O(V ) or, respectively, P Sp(V ), therefore  is just the homomorphism into the intersection of all images of . Moreover, the image of  coincides respectively with P (O(E, V ) · StOW ) or P (Sp(E, V ) · StSWp). Indeed, since O(E, V ) or, respectively, Sp(E, V ), acts transitively on F lO(W, E, V ) or F lS(W, E, V ), the image of  must be a subgroup of P (O(E, V ) · StOW ) or, respectively, P (Sp(E, V ) · StSWp). On the other hand, by the same argument as in Section 5, O(E, V ) · StOW or, respectively, Sp(E, V ) · StSWp acts on the ind-variety F lO(W, E, V ) or F lS(W, E, V ) via the formula (16). Since in our case the equality (26) holds, the proof is complete.
Corollary 7.2. The group O(E, V ) · StOW , or Sp(E, V ) · StSWp, is isomorphic to the group of all invertible W -aligned matrices M with finitary rows and columns satisfying M = ±M -1, where ·
denotes reflection along the antidiagonal, plus corresponds to the case of O and minus corresponds to
the case of Sp. Proof. The group O(E, V ) · StOW or Sp(E, V ) · StSWp is clearly the intersection of the group
GL(E, V ) · StW with O(V ) or, respectively, with Sp(V ), and this implies the claim. Note that the condition M = ±M -1 makes M eligible automatically.

Appendix: on the structure of the group G(VE, VE)
In this Appendix we have collected some basic statements about the Mackey group G(VE, VE ). The isomorphism of this group with the group Japanese GL() is stated at the end.
A.1. A lemma from linear algebra.
Lemma A.1. Let A be a countable-dimensional vector space, and µ : A  A,  : A  A be linear maps such that (µ()) = (()) for all ,   A. Then the dimensions of the images of µ and  are finite and equal.
Proof. We will first check that dim im µ < . This will imply that dim im  is also finite because the conditions on µ and  are symmetric. Pick a basis {f1, f2, . . .} of A, and let {f1, f2, . . .} be the dual system in A. Assume that im µ is infinite dimensional. Then there exist linear functions n  A for n  Z>0, such that dim µ(1), . . . , µ(n) C = n. It is easy to see that these linear functions can be chosen so that n(fi) = 0 for i < n and n(fn) = 0. Let B := n|n  Z>0 C. The formula (a, b)  b(a) for a  A, b  B defines a non-degenerate pairing between A and B. By a result of G. Mackey [M, Lemma on p. 171], we may assume without loss of generality that n = fn for all n.
Since dim im µ = , for any n  Z>0 there exists in  Z>0 such that µ(fin) is not contained in An := f1, . . . , fn C. In other words, there exist two infinite sequences of integers 1  i1 < i2 < . . . and 2  k1 < k2 < . . . so that µ(fin)  Akn \ Akn-1 for all n  1.

17

Now we define a sequence c1, c2, . . . of complex numbers inductively as follows. Set c1 to be an arbitrary nonzero scalar. For n > 1 we let cn to be an arbitrary complex number such that

n

n-1

cj fkj (µ(fin )) = cnfkn(µ(fin )) + cjfkj (µ(fin )) = 0.

j=1

j=1

(Such a number exists because fkn(µ(fin)) = 0.) Finally, we define   A by the formula

(fj) =

cn 0

if j = kn for some n  1, otherwise.

Then

n
fin(()) = (µ(fin )) = cj fkj (µ(fin )) = 0
j=1

for any n  Z>0. This means that () / Ain-1 for all n  1, i.e., that () can not be expressed as

a finite linear combination of f1, f2, . . ., and this is a contradiction.

Hence, dim im µ < , and also dim im  < . It remains to check that dim im µ = dim im .

Since dim im µ < , there exist n  Z>0 and linear functions 1, . . . , n  A such that µ(a) =

A.2. A grading on the group G(VE , VE). We work in the setup of Section 4. Recall that we consider a generalized flag having a single proper subspace W  V with dim W = codim V W = , and that E = E  W is a basis of W . Let U = E \E C. We have VE = (W)  U , VE = W  U  and there is a natural nondegenerate pairing VE × VE  C. The group G(VE , VE) consists of invertible linear operators  : VE  VE such that  = |VE : VE  VE is a well-defined isomorphism.
Choose an ordering of E via Z<0 and an ordering of E \ E via Z>0. Set
Ek := E \ {ek, . . . , e-1} for k < 0 E  {e1, . . . , ek} for k > 0
and W k := Ek C. The disjoint union Gr(W k, Ek, V ), where E = E0, W = W 0, is an ind-variety
kZ
which we denote by X.

18

Proposition A.2. The formula (4) defines an action of G(VE, VE) on X by ind-variety auto-
morphisms. Proof. We first prove that  · W   X for any W   X and any  : VE  VE,   G(VE, VE ).
Since in the definition of X, W can be replaced by W , it suffices to check that  · W  X. Denote by
U : VE  U and W : VE  W the canonical projections onto the corresponding direct summands. Set also µ := U  |(W) and  := W  (|U).
We claim that dim im µ and dim im  are finite (and equal). Fix an isomorphism of vector spaces  : W  U and the dual isomorphism  : U   (W). Consider the linear maps µ = µ   and  =    from U  to U . Then, for all ,   U , we have

(µ()) = (µ(())) = (U ((()))) = ((())) = ()(()) = W(())(()) = ()(()) = (())() = (()).

Hence, dim im µ = dim im  <  (and, consequently, dim im µ = dim im  < ) by Lemma A.1.

Now, denote by A0 the preimage of zero under the restriction of U to ((W)). Obviously, A0 = (W)  ((W)). According to the proof of Lemma A.1, there exist n  Z>0 and 1, . . . , n  W

such that

µ() = U (|(W) ()) =

n
i=1 (i)ei

for all   (W). A vector  of (W) belongs to A0 if and only if µ() = 0, i.e, if (i) = 0 for

1  i  n. It follows immediately that A0  W has finite codimension in W and, moreover, given

w  W , one has w  A0 if and only if i(w) = 0 for all 1  i  n. Hence, A0  W contains all but

finitely many vectors of E.

Recall that  · W = -1(W )  V . Clearly, W  = U , and since -1(B) = (B) for any

subspace B of VE, we conclude that

-1(U ) = ((U )) = ((W)).

Hence  · W = ((W))  V . Since A0  ((W)), we have A0  W   · W , so  · W contains all but finitely many vectors of E. On the other hand,

((W))  (W)  U (((W))) = (W)  im µ.

This implies  · W  W  im µ, and consequently  · W  X. Next, a trivial modification of the argument at the end of the proof of Theorem 1.1 for ind-
grassmannians shows that  induces an automorphism of ind-varieties

 : X  X.

Finally, the fact that    =   follows from the realization of ~ as an inverse limit of morphisms

of finite-dimensional grassmannians where the property n  n = n  n is obvious.

The ind-variety X is the disjoint union of the ind-grassmannians Gr(W k, Ek, V ) for k  Z. These

closed ind-subvarieties are not stable with respect to this action.

Example A.3.

Let a reverse sequence be a set parameterized by Z<0. The vectors in VE and VE can be written

respectively as x = ie-i + uiei  VE, y = wie-i + iei  VE where  = (. . . , -2, -1)

i>0

i>0

i>0

i>0

and w = (. . . , w-2, w-1) are reverse sequences of complex numbers, and u = (u1, u2, . . .),  =

(1, 2, . . .) are usual sequences of complex numbers. In addition, u and w are finitary, i.e. have

at most finitely many nonzero entries. In what follows, we write simply (, u) for vectors in VE, and

(w, ) for vectors in VE.

19

Consider the shift (linear) operator Sh : VE  VE Sh((, u)) = ((. . . , -3, -2), (-1, u1, u2 . . .)).
One checks immediately that Sh is an element of the group G(VE, VE ) with Sh having the form Sh((w, )) = ((. . . , w-2, w-1, 1), (2, 3, . . .)).
Moreover, Sh · W belongs to Gr(W 1, E1, V ), and in fact Sh · Gr(W, E, V ) = Gr(W 1, E1, V ). In addition, we note that
dim U (Sh((W))) - dim U (Sh-1((W))) = dim W(Sh(U )) - dim W(Sh-1(U )) = 1.

This example motivates the following.
Definition A.4. Let   G(VE , VE). We define the integer
d() = d() := dim U (((W))) - dim U (-1((W))) = dim W((U )) - dim W(-1(U ))
to be the degree of . (The latter equality follows immediately from the fact that dim im (U  |(W) ) = dim im (W  |U) checked in the proof of Proposition A.2.)
Proposition A.5. Given   G(VE , VE) and k  Z, one has  · Gr(W, E, V ) = Gr(W k, Ek, V ) if and only if d() = k.
Proof. It suffices to check that the condition  · W  Gr(W k, Ek, V ) is equivalent to d() = k. Since  · W belongs to X, the condition  · W  Gr(W k, Ek, V ) is equivalent to the equality

codim ·W (( · W )  W ) - codim W (( · W )  W ) = k.
We have  · W = ((W))  V and W  (W), hence ( · W )  W  (((W))  V )  (W) = A0  V = A0  W
where A0 = (W)  ((W)). Moreover, the opposite inclusion is clear, so ( · W )  W = A0  W . Therefore, we need to prove that

codim ((W))V (A0  W ) - codim W (A0  W ) = d().

As was shown in the proof of Proposition A.2, there exist n  Z>0 and 1, . . . , n  W such

that U (|(W) ()) =

n i=1

(i)ei

for

all

  (W),

and

A0

= {

 (W)

| (i) = 0,

1  i  n}.

Hence, A0  W = {w  W | i(w) = 0, 1  i  n} and

codim (W)A0 = codim W (A0  W ) = dim U (((W))).

(27)

It remains to check that codim ((W))V (A0  W ) = dim U (-1((W)). This is done essentially

by the same argument as above. Indeed, the argument in the proof of Proposition A.2 now shows

that there exist m  Z>0 and i  W, 1  i  m, such that U (-1|(W)()) =

m i=1

(i

)ei

for

  (W). This, together with fact that dim U (-1((W))) < , implies that, given (, u)  VE,

the condition -1((, u))  (W) is equivalent to a finite system of linear equations on finitely many

of the coordinates of (, u). Thus,

codim ((W))V (A0  W ) = codim ((W))A0 = codim ((W))(((W))  (W)) = codim (W) ((W)  -1((W))) = dim U (-1((W))).
The proof is now complete.

20

Corollary A.6. The definition of d() does not depend on the choice of W in the following sense: in the definition of d() one can replace W by any subspace W   V which is E-commensurable with W , and U -- by any direct complement U  of W  in V such that codim U U   E C < .
Proof. The claim follows directly from Proposition A.5 as the ind-varieties Gr(W k, Ek, V ) remain unchanged under a replacement W W , U U .
Now we are ready to describe the structure of the G(VE, VE)-action on X in more detail. In particular, we prove that the degree defines a grading on the group G(VE, VE). In the next theorem we set X(k) = Gr(W k, Ek, V ) for k  Z. Then X(0) = Gr(W, E, V ) and X = X(k).
kZ
Theorem A.7. Given d  Z, set Gd(VE, VE) := {  G(VE , VE) | d() = d}. Then
i)  · X(k) = X(k + d()) for all   G(VE, VE ), k  Z; ii) d(  ) = d() + d() for all ,   G(VE, VE );
iii) G0(VE, VE ) is a normal subgroup of G(VE , VE) whose cosets are Gd(VE, VE), d  Z.

Proof. i) We have d(-1) = -d() by the definition of degree. This implies that if ·X(0) = X(d) then -1 · X(0) = X(-d). In particular, since Sh · X(n) = X(n + 1) and consequently Shk · X(n) = X(n + k), we obtain Sh-k · X(n) = X(n - k) for all k, n  Z.
We claim that if  · X(0) = X(0) then  · X(k) = X(k) for all k  Z. Indeed, assume that  · X(0) = X(0) and pick an integer k. We have (Sh-k  ) · X(0) = Sh-k · ( · X(0)) = Sh-k · X(0) = X(-k). By our observation in the first paragraph, we conclude that (Sh-k  )-1 · X(0) = X(k), i.e,
(-1 · Sh-k) · X(0) = -1 · (Shk · X(0)) = -1 · X(k) = X(k).

This clearly implies  · X(k) = X(k). Now, assume that ·X(0) = X(d), i.e., that d() = d. Then (Sh-d)·X(0) = Sh-d·X(d) = X(0).
Thus, by the previous paragraph, for all k  Z we have (Sh-d  ) · X(k) = X(k), i.e.,
 · X(k) = Shd · X(k) = X(k + d).

ii) Follows immediately from (i). iii) Follows immediately from (ii).

A.3. Matrix realization. Consider the spaces VE = (W)  U , VE = W  U , and assume that the isomorphism  : W  U maps e-i to ei for i  Z>0. Then the pairing VE × VE  C is identified with the pairing
(U   U ) × (U   U )  C : ((, y), (, z))  (, y), (, z) = (z) + (y), y, z  U, ,   U .

This allows us to denote the group G(VE, VE ) = G(U   U, U   U ) simply by GU .

We now present an explicit matrix realization of the group GU . We have a fixed basis {e1, e2, . . .}

of U , and we identify U   U with the space {(, y)} where  = (. . . , -2, -1) are reverse sequences

and y = (y1, y2, . . .) are finitary usual sequences. We consider matrices whose rows and columns are

parameterized by the ordered set Z \ {0} = Z<0  Z>0. Such a matrix M naturally splits into four

blocks

M=

AB CD

.

Let J be the subset of such matrices satisfying the following conditions:

· each row of A and each column of D is finitary; (28)
· C is a finitary matrix.

21

Matrices from J act on U   U via left multiplication: one considers vectors of U   U as columns

(, y)T =

T yT

,

and we have (, y)T - (, y)T for   J.

Given a matrix   J, we let  denote the reflection of  with respect to its antidiagonal. Clearly,

 = . One checks immediately that  belongs to J, and that 12 = 2 1. Furthermore, if
 := (-1, -2, -3, . . .) for a reverse sequence  = (. . . , -3, -2, -1) and y := (. . . , y3, y2, y1) for a finitary sequence y = (y1, y2, y3, . . .), then we have (, y)T = (, y)T  for all (, y)  U U , where (, y)T = (y, ).
Let GU be the group of automorphisms of VE with matrices  such that , -1  J.
Theorem A.8. The group GU coincides with GU .
Proof. First, we prove that GU is contained in GU . Pick an operator   GU . Since U  (|U ) is a well-defined operator on the countable-dimensional space U , it is represented by a (unique) matrix

D = (di,j )i,jZ>0 with finitary columns.

Next, Lemma A.1 implies that dim im (U  (|U)) < . Moreover, according to the proof of

Lemma A.1 there exist n  Z0 and vectors c1, . . . , cn  U such that U (|U()) =

n i=1

(ci)ei

for all   U . This means that U  (|U) can be represented as a finitary matrix C = (ci,-j)i,jZ>0,

where ci = j1 ci,-jej .

Let U be the projection operator U   U  U . The operator U  (|U ) is an operator from

the space U of finitary sequences to the space U  of arbitrary reverse sequences, and is therefore given

by a matrix B = (b-i,j)i,jZ>0 . Finally, given   U , we have U(|U())(ei) = ()(ei) = ((ei)) = (U ((ei))). There exist
linear functions j  U , j  Z>0, such that U ((y)) = (1(y), 2(y), . . .). Since U ((ei)) belongs

to U , there exists k(i)  Z>0 such that j(ei) = 0 for j > k(i), i.e., U ((ei)) =

k(i) j=1

j

(ei)ej

.

Thus, U  (|U) can be represented as a matrix with finitary rows A = (a-i,-j)i,jZ>0 , where

a-i,-j = j (ei).

It follows that   GU can be represented by invertible matrices from L. This conclusion applies

also to the inverse operator -1 by the same argument.

In order to verify the inclusion GU  GU , let now  be a matrix from L such that -1  L. Then

the linear operator on U   U with matrix  is the restriction to U   U of the operator dual to the

operator defined by . Indeed,

(, y)T , (, y)T = (y, )T (, y)T = (, y)T (, y)T (29)
= (, y)T (, y)T = (, y)T , (, y)T ,

where the three middle terms are products of two or respectively three matrices. Moreover, the invertibility of  follows from the equality -1 = -1 which is a consequence of the relation 12 = 21. This shows that  determines an operator from GU .
Remark A.9. Finally, the reader will notice that if in the definition of J we replace the ordered set Z \ {0} = Z<0  Z>0 by any ordered set which is the disjoint union O1  O2 of two linearly ordered countable sets with the condition r < s for r  O1, s  O2, and define a group by imposing the conditions (28), we will obtain a group isomorphic to GU . Of course, in such a setting the matrix of the operator  = |UU , for a given   GU with matrix , will not be  as defined above, and its form will depend on the choice of O1 and O2. Moreover, there will also be analogues of the operator Sh, and we leave it to the reader to define one.
The above remark is used in the proof of Theorem 1.1 presented in Section 5. Finally, using the matrix form of the group GU given by Theorem A.8, it is straightforward to check that GU is nothing but the group of continuous automorphisms of U   U as a Tate space, see,

22

for instance, [K]. In other words, GU is the well-known group Japanese GL(), and G0(U, U ) is simply the connected component of the identity in G(U, U ) = GU .
