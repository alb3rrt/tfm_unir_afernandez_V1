## Abstract

We present a novel p-GaN gate HEMT structure with reduced hole concentration near the Schottky interface by doping engineering in MOCVD, which aims at lowering the electric field across the gate. By employing an additional unintentionally doped GaN layer, the gate leakage current is suppressed and the gate breakdown voltage is boosted from 10.6 to 14.6 V with negligible influence on the threshold voltage and on-resistance. Time-dependent gate breakdown measurements reveal that the maximum gate drive voltage increases from 6.2 to 10.6 V for a 10-year lifetime with a 1% gate failure rate. This method effectively expands the operating voltage margin of the p-GaN gate HEMTs without any other additional process steps.
