## Abstract

This work presents the analysis of the impact of restrictions on mobility in Italy, with a focus on the period from 6 November 2020 to 31 January 2021, when a three-tier system based on different levels of risk was adopted and applied at regional level to contrast the second wave of COVID-19. The impact is first evaluated on mobility using Mobile Network Operator anonymised and aggregate data shared in the framework of a Business-to-Government initiative with the European Commission. Mobility data, alongside additional information about electricity consuption, are then used to assess the impacts on an economic level of the three-tier system in different areas of the country.
