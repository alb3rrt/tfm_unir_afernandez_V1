## Abstract

In this paper we study a new class of bases, weaker than quasi-greedy bases, which retain their unconditionality properties and can provide the same optimality for the thresholding greedy algorithm. We measure how far these bases are from being unconditional and use this concept to give a new characterization of nearly unconditional bases.
