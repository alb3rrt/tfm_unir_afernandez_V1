Abstract We classify simple symmetries for an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, describing a particle in an external force field f (x). It turns out that for sufficiently regular (in a sense to be defined) forces there are nontrivial symmetries only if f (x) is at most linear. We fully discuss the isotropic case, while for the non-isotropic we only deal with a generic situation (to be defined in detail in the text).

1 Introduction

Symmetry analysis is since a long time one of the key tools to attack deterministic nonlinear differential equations, both ordinary and partial [1­7]; actually, what is nowadays known as Lie theory was created by Sophus Lie precisely to study nonlinear (ordinary) differential equations. The special case escaping an efficient use of Lie theory is that of Dynamical Systems, i.e. sets of first order ODEs [8­11].
From the point of view of Physics, there is a class of Dynamical Systems which has a special status, i.e. that corresponding to Newtonian Mechanics of point particles in a force field, possibly with dissipation:

x i = vi vi = (1/m) F i(x, v, t)

.

(1.1)

In this case one actually sets the equations as a second order system,

x¨i = (1/m) F i(x, x , t) ,

(1.2)

which also allows for an efficient use of Lie theory. These equations do generally admit no symmetry, and when F is time autonomous they
are generically invariant under time translation only; but for certain forms of F , other symmetries can arise. (In the frictionless case and for F arising from a potential (x), these symmetries immediately lead ­ through a variational formulation in Lagrangian terms and Noether theorem ­ to conserved quantities.)
The description of a physical system as an isolated system only subject to a given external (maybe potential) force and with no dissipation is of course in many ­ if not all ­ physical situations only an idealization of a more complex situation, in which dissipation is present, and other forces beside those taken into account are also present. In many cases, dissipation can be described in terms of a friction force (not necessarily linear, but however depending on the velocity v), and the extra forces can be described in terms of a stochastic perturbation.
In other words, the ideal system (1.1) should be replaced by the system of Ito stochastic differential equations [12­18] depending on independent Wiener processes wi(t),

dxi = vi dt

,

dvi = (1/m) F i(x) -  vi dt +  dwi .

(1.3)

This is also known as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for a point particle of mass m in the force field F (x) [19, 20].
It should be noted that from the point of view of Ito equations, this is a degenerate system, in that the associated diffusion matrix is in this case a degenerate one,

D=

00 0I

.

(1.4)

Symmetry of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) has been studied only in relatively recent years [21­47]. By now, a sound formulation of the theory is available, and we know how to use symmetries to integrate ­ or reduce the order of ­ SDEs [29­38]. In studying symmetries of SDEs, it is customary to assume that the diffusion matrix has full

4

G. Gaeta

rank; this already shows that the equations (1.3) may have special properties from this point of view.
The question we want to tackle in this note, at least for the simplest case of homogeneous and isotropic dissipation and homogeneous and isotropic (but we will also consider the "generic" ­ in a sense to be specified later on ­ anisotropic case) stochastic perturbation, is that of classifying the symmetries of the stochastic system (1.3) with diffusion matrix (1.4).
We will assume the reader to be familiar with the basics of Lie theory for (deterministic) differential equations [1­7], and recall the relevant concepts and formulas concerning symmetry of stochastic differential equations in Sect.2 below, referring to the literature for further detail.
It is appropriate to mention here some general matters concerning the notation we will use in this work.
As customary in discussing symmetries, we will only consider continuous ones (i.e. Lie symmetries); Lie symmetries are in fact the only ones which can be used to integrate or reduce the equations. By a standard abuse of notation we will routinely denote as "symmetries" the infinitesimal generators of these.
By "an equation", we will always mean possibly ­ and actually, generally ­ a vector one, i.e. a system of coupled scalar equations. Summation over repeated indices will always be understood. We will also use the shorthand notation

i

:=

 xi

;

k

:=

 wk

;

t

:=

 t

.

(1.5)

A number of Remarks will address side questions, which can be safely skipped on a first reading.

Remark 1. It should be noted that other forms of the noise terms could be considered:

e.g. in the context of population dynamics, it would be natural to have noise coefficient

proportional to |x| (environmental noise) or to |x| (demographical noise), as discussed in

[41]. Our choice (1.4) is the natural one in view of the Mechanical origin of the equation

(1.3).



Remark 2. As well known, to any Ito equation corresponds a Stratonovich equation; the

correspondence between the two has actually some subtle point [18]. There is also, as

should be expected, a correspondence between symmetries of an Ito equation and those

of the corresponding Stratonovich equation [15, 27, 28, 34, 37]; see in particular [28], also

for correction to previous literature. Here we will only work in the Ito framework, but a

completely equivalent (up to the subtle points mentioned above) Stratonovich formulation

would also be possible.

2 Symmetry of stochastic differential equations

Let us consider a general Ito equation

dxi = f i(x, t) dt + ik(x, t) dwk ,

(2.6)

where wk = wk(t) are standard independent Wiener processes [12­18], and i, k = 1, ..., n. In the applications of symmetries to integration of the Ito equation, one is mainly
interested in simple symmetries, i.e. in those not affecting time; the reason for this lies in Kozlov approach [29­31] connecting simple symmetries to integration ­ or at least reduction [35] ­ of stochastic equations.
In this case the most general generator of (continuous) symmetries reads

X

=

i(x,

t;

w)

 xi

+

hk (x,

t;

w)

 wk

=

i i + hk k .

(2.7)

As discussed in detail in [40] (see in particular Section VI and Lemma 1 in there), the functional form of the hi is actually strongly constrained: it results that

hi(x, t; w) = Rij wj , with R a matrix in the Lie algebra of the linear conformal group,

(2.8)

O(n) × (R+)n ;

(2.9)

in practice, R is the sum of a diagonal and a skew-symmetric matrices,

R = D + S , Dij = riij , Sji = -Sij .

(2.10)

Thus, with the shorthand notation introduced above, we have to consider symmetry generators of the form

X = i(x, t; w) i + Rkmwmk ,

(2.11)

with R as specified by (2.10).

Remark 3. Actually the most general acceptable action on the time coordinate is a

reparametrization of this, see again [40], or [32­34]; this would correspond to a term

 (t)t being inserted in X. Thus very little is lost in restricting to simple symmetries

even from the point of view of classifying general symmetries ­ beside the fact that,

as already mentioned, non-simple symmetries cannot be used in the Kozlov integration

scheme [29­31, 35].



Remark 4. Let us recall some convention used in the literature. Symmetries with R = 0 and  not depending on w are called deterministic symmetries; those with R = 0 but with at least some  depending on some w are called random symmetries. Symmetries with R = 0 are also called W-symmetries to emphasize that they affect the Wiener processes1. It should be stressed that while the previous classes of symmetries are special cases, W-symmetries are actually the most general case, and the name serves to stress that

1The condition on R seen above descends from the requirement to map the independent Wiener processes into independent Wiener processes; the effect of the conformal factor R+ can be absorbed into the diffusion coefficients  and this is hence allowed. See [32, 40] for details.

"full advantage is taken" of all the possible dependencies ­ and hence of all possible

transformations.



As shown in Lemma 3 of [40], the determining equations for general (hence W) symmetries of the Ito equation (2.6) are

 :=

2 xj wk

j,k

(2.14)

At some point it will be convenient to have a standard notation for referring to these equations; we will then refer to the i-th equation in (2.12) as Ei, and to the equation with indices i, k in (2.13) as Eik.

Remark 5. The equations (2.12) are a "first block" of n equations, while (2.13) are a "second block" of n2 equations. Note that the latter only depend on the diffusion coefficients ij, but not on the drift coefficients f i; equations in the first block depend on  through the Ito Laplacian. It will thus be generally convenient to study the equations

starting from those in the "second block". We will also refer to equations in the two blocks

as the "f -determining equations" and the "-determining equations", respectively, albeit

- as mentioned above - this is not completely correct (as the f -determining equations also

depend on  through the Ito Laplacian).



Remark 6. Examples of the determination and applications of W-symmetries for Ito equations are provided in [40]; see also [32] for deterministic and random symmetries. 

Remark 7. As recalled above, the theory could also be developed in terms of Stratonovich equations; the determining equations for W-symmetries of a Stratonovich equation are also discussed in [40]; see also [32, 34, 35] for their deterministic and random symmetries. 

Remark 8. W-symmetries have been used to integrated the logistic equation with multi-

plicative noise (which has a relevant role in Mathematical Biology) [41]; the symmetries

of scalar equations with multiplicative noise have been completely classified [42]; this is

equivalent to the classification of equations in such a class which can be integrated by the

Kozlov approach [29­31, 38].



3 Invariants of stochastic differential equations
The work of R. Kozlov [36­38] stresses the relevance of invariants for Ito equations. Given the equation (2.6), which will now be denoted as E, we say that
 = (x, t; w)

Symmetry of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process

is an invariant for the equation if the differential of  computed along the equation vanishes. We have, with standard (Ito) calculus,

d|E = =

Thus the requirement d|E = 0 amounts to n + 1 equations,

(3.15) (3.16)

If the equation (2.6) admits an invariant , then the invariant will not change along the evolution described by the equation; it is thus obviously convenient to change variables (x, w), taking  to be one of the new variables.
It should be noted that such a change of variables will in general be possible only locally (due to singularities of the Jacobian); a relevant exception is obtained when  is a linear function of its (xi, wk) ­ or at least of the xi ­ arguments.
Example 3.1. [36] Consider the geometric Brownian motion equation (here ,  are real constants)
dx =  x dt +  x dw ;

for this the function

 = x exp -

is an invariant.



4 The algebraic structure of symmetries of an Ito equation

It was shown in [36] that:

Proposition 4.1. The commutator of two symmetry generators X1, X2 for a given Ito equation is still a symmetry generator.

Proof. This is shown by direct computation in [36]. The same conclusion can be

reached by recalling the correspondence between symmetries of an Ito equation and of

the corresponding Stratonovich equation. The structure of the determining equations for

symmetries of a Stratonovich equation shows immediately that the commutator of (vector

fields having as coefficients) two solutions is still a (vector field having as coefficients) a

solution.



Corollary 4.1. The symmetry generators of an Ito equation form a Lie algebra.

8

G. Gaeta

Proposition 4.2. If X is a symmetry generator for the Ito equation, then Y = X is a symmetry generator if and only if  is an invariant for the same Ito equation.

Proof. This is shown also in [36], but we give here a simple direct proof. In fact, the determining equations for Y = ii with i = i read

i = 0

,

 ki + jkj i - j jik + k + jkj  i = ijRjk .

(4.17) (4.18)

For deterministic or random symmetries, we have R = 0, i.e. the r.h.s. of the second set

of equations is identically zero.

If X = ii is a symmetry generator, the term in square bracket in (4.17) is zero, and

the term in square bracket in (4.18) is just R. On the other hand, if  is an invariant,

the terms in round brackets are zero.



Corollary 4.2. The symmetry generators of an Ito equation have, beside the structure of Lie algebra, also that of a Lie module.

Remark 9. These properties correspond to those for symmetries of a deterministic dy-

namical system [2].



Remark 10. The discussion in Sect.IX of [32] seems to be in contradiction to this. The

reason is that in there the restriction on the functional form of h(x, t; w) introduced in

Sect.2, i.e. h(x, t; w) = Rw, was not implemented (as the need for this restriction was

only discussed in the later paper [40]). Also, when one implements this restriction in

Example 11 of [32], it turns out no simple t-independent symmetries exist.



5 Integration of stochastic equations via symmetry and/or invariants
The relevance of symmetries in the analysis of SDEs lies in that once (and if) symmetries are determined, they can be used constructively to integrate the equation, or at least to reduce it to a lower dimensional one.

5.1 Integration or reduction via invariants
Invariants can be readily used to express (at least locally, as already remarked) the solution x(t) of a SDE in terms of the invariants themselves ­ and of course of the realization of the involved Wiener processes.
Note that if a higher dimensional equation has a number of invariants smaller than its dimension, the reduction by invariants will in general only allow to express some of the components xi(t) of the solution in terms of the invariants and of the other components.
Example 5.1. [36] For the geometric Brownian motion considered in the Example 3.1 above, knowledge of the invariant  immediately allows to write x(t) in the form

x(t) = C exp



-

t +  w(t)

,

Symmetry of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process

9

with C = (0) an arbitrary constant (in fact, given by the value of  at the initial time

t = 0; for w(0) = 0 this is just x(0)). This provides a full solution to our stochastic

equation, giving an explicit expression for x(t) for each realization of the driving Wiener

process w(t).



5.2 Integration or reduction via symmetries

We can now consider the use of symmetries for solving, or at least reducing, stochastic equations. Let us first consider the scalar case, in which determination of a single simple symmetries allows to integrate the equation.
The key observation is that (denoting for a moment the spatial variable as y and the Wiener process as z(t)) if we have a symmetry of the form

X = y , then necessarily the Ito equation is of the special form

(5.19)

dy = f (t) dt + (t) dz .

(5.20)

In fact, consider the determining equations (2.12), (2.13), seeing these now as equations for the f and  coefficients with  = 1 and R = 0 given (vector indices are absent as we deal with the scalar case). They are just

yf = 0 , y = 0 .

Now, the point is that eq.(5.20) is promptly integrated, and we get

t

t

y(t) = y(t0) + f (t) dt + (t) dz(t) .

t0

t0

(5.21)

Thus, if we determine a symmetry of the Ito equation (2.6) the general form (2.7), we can seek a change of coordinates (x, t; w)  (y, t; z) mapping this into (5.19); as symmetries are preserved under diffeomorphisms [34], in the new coordinates the equation will be in the form (5.20), and thus promptly integrated. It should be stressed that symmetry is not only a sufficient condition for integrability [29­31], but a necessary one as well [35].
The situation is only slighter more complicated, but not conceptually different, if we deal with higher dimensions and with higher dimensional symmetry algebras [35]. Essentially, reduction will be performed by stages, through multiple changes of coordinates; at each stage one of the scalar equations can be integrated in terms of the solutions to the remaining system. Note that, as always in symmetry analysis, multiple reduction should be performed following the algebraic structure [1­7], or one could be unable to take full advantage of the symmetries (these could be "lost in reduction" if the proper order is not followed).
We give here a very simple example in dimension one. Examples with higher dimensional equations or with random or W-symmetries would be more involved; we refer the reader to the literature, see in particular [30, 32, 33, 35, 40], for these.

Example 5.2. [34, 35] The Ito equation

dy = e-y - (1/2) e-2y dt + e-y dw

(5.22)

10

G. Gaeta

admits the vector field X = e-yy as a symmetry generator. By the change of variables x = exp[y] the vector field reads X = x, and the initial equation (5.22) reads
dx = dt + dw .

Thus we have x(t) = x(t0) + (t - t0) + [w(t) - w(t0)] (note this is positive for x(t0) > 1).

Inverting the change of coordinates, y(t) = log[x(t)], we get a solution to the original

equation.



Remark 11. It should be stressed that the application to the case of deterministic or random symmetries is rather straightforward (see e.g. Sect.7 in [35]): the required change of variables does not affect neither time nor the Wiener processes and in the scalar case it is just x = (y, t; w) with

(y, t; w) =

1 (x, t;

w)

dy

.

(5.23)

On the other hand, in the case of W-symmetries we are not guaranteed that operating

with these changes of symmetry we remain within the framework of Ito equations: thus,

albeit the procedure is exactly the same, we will discover only a posteriori if it provides

an integration of the equation under study.2



6 Ito equations for an isotropic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process

We should now consider the dynamical system describing the motion of a particle (or system of particles) in a force field which is in part due to a potential and in part due to a stochastic perturbation ­ as in Brownian Motion.
It is well known that it does not suffice to add a fluctuating force term: in the case of Brownian motion this follows from the fact that a particle with a net drift in some direction collides with more background particles on the front side than on the back side; but it is also needed in general to keep the average (in statistical sense) Energy constant.
Thus a classical particle (of unit mass, for ease of notation) moving in a force field F(x, t) (possibly, but not necessarily, originating from a potential and subject moreover to a (constant intensity) stochastic force obeys the Ito equation

dxi = vi dt dvi = F i(x, t) -  vi +  dwi

(6.24)

with  and  positive real constants.

Remark 12. For the physical Brownian Motion these constants are classically related to each other ­ and to the temperature T ­ by

2 = 2   T , m

(6.25)

where  is the Boltzmann constant, and T the absolute temperature. See e.g. [19] for a

careful discussion of the derivation of the equations (6.24).



2This question could also be studied a priori, i.e. without actually implementing the change of coordinates; but in practice this is harder than just changing coordinates and check if we are in the favorable case. See [40] for details.

Symmetry of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process

11

The equations (6.24) can be generalized by introducing anisotropic and possibly inhomogeneous friction and underlying stochastic perturbation terms. Considering these would be conceptually non different from the isotropic case, but would introduce some (nontrivial) algebraic complications. We will thus stick to the isotropic case, albeit we will start by discussing the general ­ hence possibly anisotropic ­ case in Sect.7.
As mentioned above, we can consider not only the case where the deterministic forces arise from a potential, but also the more general case of a force field, and the case where even in the absence of an underlying Brownian field the particle is experiencing a friction drag. In this sense the coefficient  should not necessarily be of the form required by (6.25).

Remark 13. We stress again that when referring to the isotropic case, we always mean

that the friction and diffusion coefficients  and  are the same for the different degrees

of freedom, and correspondingly in the anisotropic case we drop this assumption. No

reference is made to the external force field f (x), which even in the isotropic case can very

well be anisotropic.



7 Symmetries and invariants for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. General features

Our discussion will show that results depend on the form of the external force field, in particular on the degree of the function f (x), and on the system being isotropic or anisotropic in the sense discussed at the end of the previous Section.
In this Section we will discuss, as far as possible, the situation for invariants and symmetries in general terms, i.e. for a system with n degrees of freedom ­ which gives a system of Ito equations of dimension 2n. We will arrive at a set of reduced determining equations and a reduced general form for the symmetry generator; further discussion will depend on the aforementioned details, and is postponed to ensuing Sections.
Our general formalism, see Sect.2, would require to consider 2n independent Wiener processes; but it is clear from (6.24) that only n of these appear in the equations. We will thus denote these 2n Wiener processes as {z1, w1, z2, w2, ..., zn, wn}; the wi do play a role in the equations and will play a real role in our discussion, while the zi are "ghost" Wiener processes.
Correspondingly, the matrix  will be written as

 = diag 0, µ(1), ..., 0, µ(n) , which of course yields

(7.26)

 T = diag 0, µ2(1), ..., 0, µ2(n) .

(7.27)

7.1 Invariants
As discussed in Sect.2, knowledge of invariants can be helpful in analyzing symmetries, and sometimes even in determining solutions to a stochastic equation. We will thus begin with studying invariants for the equation (6.24).

12

G. Gaeta

In general terms, we will consider a scalar function

h = h(x, v, t; , w) .

(7.28)

We will then consider its differential

dh

=

h xi

dxi

+

h vi

dvi

+

h zi

dzi

+

h wi

dwi

+

h t

+

1 2

(h)

dt

and evaluate it on solutions to (6.24), i.e. substitute for dxi and dvi according to this; in this way we will obtain an expression in dt, dzi, dwi. For the latter to vanish, all coefficients
of the different differentials must vanish separately. Proceeding in this way, and considering first the coefficient of dzi, we immediately
obtain that

h zi

=

0.

(7.29)

Moreover, considering also the coefficient of dwi, we obtain that

h = P (x, t; )

(7.30)

having defined the characteristic variables

i

:=

wi

-

vi µ(i)

.

(7.31)

Note that we are performing a change of variables (x, v, t; z, w)  (x, v, t; z, ). Now dh = dP contains only the dt differential, i.e. we are reduced to a single equation.
In this, however, we have terms which are linear in the vi. As the unknown function P does not depend on these variables, their coefficient on the equation must vanish separately. Such coefficients are of the form

1 µ(1)...µ(n)

(i) P µ(i) i

+

P xi

,

(7.32)

hence their vanishing imply that

P (x, t, ) = Q(u, t) ,

(7.33)

having defined the new characteristic variables

ui

:=

i

-

(i) µ(i)

xi

.

Introducing these, we are considering a second change of variables

(7.34)

(x, v, t; z, )  (x, v, t; z, u) .

(7.35)

With this, we reach the expression

dh = dQ

=

Q t

-

n F i(x) Q i=1 µ(i) ui

That is, invariants are identified by solutions to

Q t

=

n F i(x) Q i=1 µ(i) ui

,

Q = Q(u, t) .

(7.37)

Obviously, solutions to this equation will depend on the assigned functions F i(x) and
on the assigned nonzero real constants µ(i). We cannot go any further in full generality. We note however two special cases.

7.1.1 Constant force

First of all, suppose that f (x) = c. Then, writing i := ci/µ(i), equation (7.37) reads

Q t

=

n

i

Q ui

i=1

(7.38)

and is solved by an arbitrary function

Q = Q(1, ..., n)

(7.39)

of the characteristic variables

i := ui + i t .

(7.40)

We have thus shown that:
Lemma 7.1. The the 1, ...n are the basic invariants for the equation (6.24) with constant (possibly zero) external forces F i(x) = ci.

7.1.2 Linear force In the case where F i(x) is a linear function,

F i(x) = Lij xj + Ki ,

(7.41)

the equation (7.37) decouples into n + 1 equations. The terms independent of the x yield again (7.38) but now with

i := Ki/µ(i) .
(Note the equation reduces to Q/t = 0 for Ki = 0.) The terms in which xi appears yield the equation

(7.42)

n1 j=1 µ(j)

Q uj

Lji

=

0.

(7.43)

This set of n + 1 PDEs does not admit a nontrivial solution when L is non-degenerate. In fact, define the matrix L with entries

Lij = µ-(i)1 Lij ;

(7.44)

14

G. Gaeta

we have

det(L)

=

1 µ(1)...µ(n)

det(L)

so L regular implies that L is also regular, and acting on (7.43) by L-1 we obtain that necessarily (Q/ui) = 0. In view of (7.37) this also implies that (Q/t) = 0, so we are
left with trivial invariants only:

Lemma 7.2 The equation (6.24) with linear external forces F i(x) = Lijxj and L nondegenerate admit no non-trivial invariant.

7.2 Symmetries

We come now to considering symmetries of the general Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (6.24). We will write a general vector field (not acting on t, as implied by our choice of considering only simple symmetries) in the form

X=

n

i(x,

v,

t;

z,

w)

 xi

+

i(x,

v,

t;

z,

w)

 vi

+

(7.45)

where

XR =

R22i-j11zj + R2i-1 2jwj

 zi

+

R22ij1 zj + R2i 2jwj

 wi

(7.46)

is the part related to the R matrix and present only in the proper W-symmetries. We proceed then to writing the determining equations (2.12), (2.13). As already re-
marked, it is convenient to start analyzing the "second block", i.e. the -determining equations (2.13).

7.2.1 The -determining equations

The

equations

E

2i-1 2j-1

read

i zj

= 0,

which of course tells that the i do not depend on the "ghost" variables zj. The equations E22i-j 1 read instead

(7.47)

i wj

+

µ(j)

i vj

= 0.

(7.48)

Taking

account

of

both

these

groups

of

equations

(that

is,

of

all

equations

E

2i-1 k

with

odd

upper index) we have

i = i(x, t, ) ,

(7.49)

having defined the characteristic variables

i

:=

wi

-

vi µ(i)

.

(7.50)

Symmetry of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process

15

The equations E22ij-1 read

i zj

= µ(i) R22ij-1 ;

these do of course imply

(7.51)

i = i(x, t; w) + µ(i) R22ij-1 zj . With this, the equations E22ij read

(7.52)

i wj

= µ(i) R22ij ,

and thus we get

(7.53)

i(x, t; w) = (x, t) + µ(i) R22ij wj ,

(7.54)

which in view of the above means

i = i(x, t) + µ(i) R22ji -1 zj + R22ji wj .

(7.55)

We

have

thus

solved

all

the

E

i k

equations;

the

form

of



and



has

been

restricted

to

the forms (7.49), (7.55), while R is not restricted yet. Note that it is convenient to use

the  variables as new variables; in order to do this we change variables by

(x, v, t; z, w)  (x, , t; z, w) . (It is more convenient to replace the vi than replacing the wi, as the latter appear in .)

7.2.2 The f -determining equations

We should now tackle the f -determining equations, i.e. the n equations Ek, see (2.12). These have a rather involved expression which we do not report here. It should be
noted that the unknown functions ,  do not depend on the z and w variables; thus all dependencies of these are fully explicit, and the coefficients of different monomials in these should vanish separately.
Actually, the Ek only contain terms linear in the zi and wi, which simplifies our task. The vanishing of the terms in zm in Ek (or, equivalently, the differential consequence Ek/zm) yields
µ(k) R22km-1 = 0 ;
as by assumption the µ(k) are nonzero, this means that

R22km-1 = 0 .

(7.56)

Moreover, by the general form of R, we should also have (this and the previous equation hold for all k, m = 1, ..., n)

R22mk-1 = 0 .

(7.57)

Thus, the R matrix has nonzero entries Rij only if both indices have the same parity. Now the equations Ek do not contain any zi term.

16

G. Gaeta

The same argument used for zi can be used for wi. The vanishing of the term in wm within E2k-1 (or equivalently the differential consequence E2k-1/wm) reads

(m)

k m

+

µ(m)

k xm

=

µ(k) R22km ;

(7.58)

these are solved by

i(x, t, )

=

(u, t)

+

n µ(i) j=1 µ(j)

R22ij xj ,

(7.59)

having defined the new characteristic variables

ui

:=

i

-

(i) µ(i)

xi

=

wi

-

1 µ(i)

vi

-

(i) µ(i)

xi .

(7.60)

We still have to impose the vanishing of the term in wm within E2k (or equivalently the differential consequence E2k/wm); this reads

µ(m)

k xm

+ (k) µ(k) R22km

=

0,

and enforces

i

=

i(t)

-

(i)

n µ(i) j=1 µ(j)

R22ij xj .

(7.61) (7.62)

Remark 14. It may be worth pausing to make the point of the situation: we have reduced the equations Ek by eliminating all terms linear in the zi and wi variables; in doing so we have reached the functional forms

i

=

i(u, t)

+ 

n j=1

(7.63) (7.64)

As for the matrix R, it contains only terms with both indices odd or both indices even.

We still have the equations Ek, which albeit reduced are rather involved. In these, the force functions F i(x) appear explicitly. In particular, the odd-numbered equations E2i-1

are

(7.66)

It is clear that these will simplify in the isotropic case, to be dealt with in the later Section

9 devoted to it.



We note at this point that only entries of the R matrix with both indices even are present in our final equations (7.65) and (7.66), as well as in the functional form of the  and  functions. It is then convenient to consider the reduced R matrix R with entries

Rij := R22ij .

(7.67)

In terms of this, we have

(7.70) (7.71)

As in the discussion about invariants, we note that obviously, solutions to this equation will depend on the assigned functions F i(x) and on the assigned nonzero real constants
(i), µ(i). Thus, here too we cannot go any further in full generality. We note the same two special cases considered for invariants.

7.2.3 Constant force

For F i(x) = ci, the equation (7.71) reduces to

di dt

18

G. Gaeta

Recalling that  = (t), and that µ(i) = 0, we immediately obtain that the vanishing of the term in uj implies

R = 0.

(7.73)

Note that this in turn implies i = i(u, t) , i = i(t) .

(7.74)

Moreover, we should have di/dt = -(i)i, i.e.

i(t) = K(i) exp[-(i)t] .

Writing again i = ci/µ(i), the equations (7.70) read then

i t

-

n

j

i uj

j=1

= i(t) = K(i) exp[-(i)t] .

We thus have a set of n uncoupled equations, each of the form

L(i) = K(i) exp[-(i)t] ,

where the linear operator is defined by

(7.75) (7.76) (7.77)

L

:=

 t

+

j

 uj

.

The kernel of L consists in arbitrary functions of 1, ..., n, where we define

i

:=

ui

+

i t

=

wi

-

1 µ(i)

vi

-

(i) µ(i)

xi

+

ci µ(i)

t

.

The most general solution to (7.76) is therefore

(7.78)

i(u, t) = i(1, ..., n) +

(t) dt

=

i(1, ..., n)

-

K(i) (i)

exp[-(i)t] .

Going back to the coefficients ,  in X, we have thus got i = i(1, ..., n) + e-(i)t Ki , i = - e-(i)t (i) Ki .
In other words, we have n symmetry vector fields of the form

(7.79)

e-(i)t

 xi

-

(i)

 vi

and an infinite set of symmetry vector fields, depending on an arbitrary function of the  variables,

Yf(i)

=

f (1, ..., n)

 xi

.

(7.80)

This corresponds to the i being the basic invariants of our equations (6.24) for the case of constant force field, see Sect.7.1. As symmetries can be multiplied by a constant on the

Symmetry of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process

19

dynamics, the n vector fields identified above also identify an infinite set of vector fields depending on an arbitrary function of the i,

Xf(i) = f (1, ..., n) e-(i)t

 xi

-

(i)

 vi

.

(7.81)

In order to write in a compact way the commutation relations among these fields, i.e.
in the Lie algebra G of symmetries for our equation, we will introduce a simplified notation for partial derivatives of a function f = f (1, ..., n): we will write

fk := f /k .

(7.82)

The commutation relations between the vector fields (7.81) and (7.80) are then:

Xf(i) , Xg(j) = 0 ,

Yf(i) , Yg(j)

=

(j) µ(j)

f j

g

 xi

-

(i) µ(i)

f

g i

 xj

=

Y((i()j)/µ(j))(fj g) - Y((j()i)/µ(i))(f gi) ,

(7.83)

Xf(i) , Yg(j)

=

(j) µ(j)

f j

g

e-(i)t

=

X((i)(j)/µ(j))(fj g) .

 xi

-

(i)

 v(i)

Thus the fields {Xf(i)} and the fields {Yf(i)} form (infinite dimensional) subalgebras of G, each of these with also the structure of a sub-module; and the (7.81) are an Abelian ideal in G.
We summarize our discussion as follows.

Lemma 7.3 The equation (6.24) with constant (possibly zero) external forces F i(x) = ci admits an infinite dimensional Lie algebra G of symmetries, generated by the vector fields (7.80) and (7.81) and whose structure is defined by the commutations relations (7.83); this G has also the structure of a Lie module over the ring of invariants, generated by {1, ..., n}. The set of the (7.81) is an Abelian ideal in G.

7.2.4 Linear force

Let us consider again the case

F i(x) = Lij xj + Ki .

Differentiating eq. (7.71) w.r.t. xj, we obtain

j

µ(j) µ(k)

Li j

Rjk

+

µ(i) µ(k)

(i) - (k)

Rik = 0

(7.84)

It is convenient to introduce a modified R matrix, which will be denoted as R, with entries

Rij

=

µ(i) µ(j)

Rij

=

µ(i) µ(j)

R22i j

.

(7.85)

20

G. Gaeta

Now the previous equation reads Lij Rjk + (i) - (k) Rik = 0 .
This can be set in fully matrix notation by introducing the diagonal matrix

then (7.86) reads

B = diag (1), ..., (n) :

L R = B R - R B = B, R .

(7.86) (7.87)

Remark 15. This could be slightly simplified using (2.10), as the diagonal matrices B

and D commute and [B, S] is a symmetric matrix; but this does not allow to get any final

result for general L.



8 The one-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process

We will now start considering some special cases, in which the general analysis conducted
in Sect.7 above can be furthered.
The simplest case is of course the one-dimensional one, n = 1. In this case we just write  = (1), µ = µ(1), x = x1, and so on. In other words, we deal with the equation

dx = v dt

,

dv = [F (x) -  v] dt + µ dw .

(8.88)

8.1 Invariants

Before analyzing symmetries of (8.88), we will study its invariants. In our simple setting, the equation (7.37) reads simply

Q t

=

F (x) µ

Q u

,

Q = Q(u, t) .

(8.89)

Differentiating this w.r.t. x, we get immediately

F (x) (Q/u) = 0 .

Now two possibilities should be considered. If F (x) = 0, then we must have (Q/u) = 0; this in turn implies, by (8.89), (Q/t) = 0 as well. That is, in this case no nontrivial invariants exist.
On the other hand, if F (x) = c (with c a constant), then (8.89) is solved by

Q(u, t) = [u + (c/µ)t]

(8.90)

with  an arbitrary function. In other words, we have the basic invariant

J

=

u

+

(c/µ) t

=

w

-

1 µ

v

-

 µ

x

+

c µ

t

.

We summarize the result of our discussion as follows:

(8.91)

Lemma 8.1. The equation (8.88) admits no nontrivial invariant unless F (x) = c; in this case, the ring of invariants is generated by J given in (8.91).

Symmetry of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process

21

8.2 Symmetries

Let us now consider symmetries of (8.88). In this setting, our final results from the discussion in Sect.7 read

 = (u, t) + R22 x ,

 = (t) + [µ R22 w -  R22 x] ;

R=

R11 0 0 R22

for what concerns the symmetry vector components, while the reduced determining equa-

tions are

 t

-

 u

F µ

=

(t) + µ R22 u ,

(8.92)

d dt

+



=

F x

 + R22 x -  µ R22 u .

(8.93)

Differentiating the second equation w.r.t. u, we immediately obtain R22 = 0; with this the equations are further reduced to

 t

-

 u

F µ

= (t) ,

d dt

+



=

F x

.

(8.94)

Differentiating now the first equation w.r.t. x, and recalling µ = 0, we obtain F (x) u = 0 .
At this point, we should consider different possibilities for F .

(8.95)

8.2.1 Case A: F (x) = 0, F (x) = 0

If F (x) = 0, we necessarily have /u = 0, i.e.

(u, t) = (t) .

(8.96)

The determining equations are therefore

d dt

=

(t) ,

d dt

+



=

F x

.

Differentiating again the second equation w.r.t. x, we obtain

F (x)  = 0 .

(8.97)

If we assume that F (x) = 0 either, then necessarily  = 0, and in view of the other
equation we also have  = 0. In other words, in the case F (x) = 0 we are left with the only symmetry

X0 = z z .

(8.98)

As anticipated, this is actually a "ghost" symmetry, as the variable z does not appear in the equation under study, and is only present to fit in our general formalism developed in previous work [32, 33, 40]. Thus X0, which is always formally present, should be disregarded. We should only look at "real" (simple) symmetries.
We conclude that:

Lemma 8.2. For F (x) = 0, the equation (8.88) has no real simple symmetry.

22

G. Gaeta

8.2.2 Case B: F (x) = 0, F (x) = 0 We will next consider the case with F (x) = 0 but F (x) = 0. This corresponds to

F (x) =  x + c ,  = 0 .

(8.99)

Now the equation (8.93) reads

 +   =   + R22 x -  µ R22 u .

(8.100)

Differentiating this w.r.t. u we get



 u

=

 µ R22 ,

which requires

(u, t)

=

(t)

+

µ 

R22

u

.

The equation (8.93) becomes now

 +   =  ( + R22 x) ,

(8.101)

which requires R22 = 0. Finally, (8.92) and (8.93) are reduced now to  =  ,  (t) =  +   .

(8.102)

Putting the two equations together, we have to solve a second order linear equation with constant coefficients; with the shorthand notation

± :=  ±

2 2

+ 4

,

the final outcome is

(8.103)

(t) = C+ e-+t + C- e--t , (t) = -C+ + e-+t - C- - e--t .

We thus have (apart from the ghost symmetry X0) two independent simple symmetries:

X+ = e-+t (x - + v) , X- = e--t (x - - v) .

(8.104)

We easily check that

[X+, X-] = 0 .

(8.105)

We summarize our discussion as:

Lemma 8.3. For F (x) = x + c, with  = 0, the equation (8.88) has two real simple symmetries, given by (8.104); they commute.

Symmetry of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process

23

8.2.3 Case C: F (x) = 0 In the case F (x) = 0, i.e. F (x) = c, the equations (8.92), (8.93) read



=

 t

-

c µ

 u

-

µ R22 u

 +   = -  µ R22 u .

The second equation requires R22 = 0. Inserting this into the equations and differentiating the second one, we get
(u, t) = (t) + [u + (c/µ)t] .

Now the determining equations are reduced to

 =  ,  = -   ;

the solution is (t) = C1 e-t , (t) = -(C1/) e-t + C2 .
Recalling that

(8.106)

 = (t) + [u + (c/µ)t] ,  = (t) ,

(8.107)

we conclude that there are ­ beside the usual ghost symmetry generator X0 ­ two symmetry generators given by

X1 = x , X2 = e-t (x -  v) ;

(8.108)

and moreover an infinite set of symmetries with generator

Y = [u + (c/µ)t] x .

(8.109)

This is not a surprise: in fact we already know that for F (x) = c the function



:=

u

+

(c/µ) t

=

w

-

1 µ

(v

+

x

-

c t)

(8.110)

is an invariant. This same fact implies that actually the constants Ci appearing in (8.106) should be
thought as constants on the dynamics, i.e. possibly as functions of the same argument . Note that then X1 is a special case of X, corresponding to () = 1. In other words, we have two infinite sets of symmetries depending on arbitrary (smooth) functions of , i.e.

X = () e-t (x -  v) , Y = () x .

(8.111)

The symmetry set G is infinite dimensional as a Lie algebra, but two dimensional ­ with generators given in (8.108) ­ as a Lie module over the set of invariants for our equation.
The commutation relations are given by

[Xf , Xg] = 0 [Yf , Yg] = (/µ) f () g() - f () g() x = Y(/µ)(fg-fg) [Xf , Yg] = (/µ) e-t f () g() (x -  v) = X(/µ)fg .

(8.112)

24

G. Gaeta

Thus the sets {Xf } and {Yf } are both subalgebras of G; and {Xf } is an Abelian ideal in G.
Finally, we note that the only difference between the cases with c = 0 and with c = 0 lies in that for c = 0, q is independent of t; while for c = 0 it depends on t.
We summarize our findings as follows.
Lemma 8.4. For F (x) = c, the real symmetries of equation (8.88) are given by (8.111) with f, g arbitrary smooth functions of the variable  defined in (8.110). The Lie algebra structure is defined by the relations (8.112).

9 The n-dimensional isotropic case.

We will now consider the isotropic case; we recall this is meant in the sense discussed in Remark 13. That is, we have no hypothesis (yet) on F (x), but we assume

(1) = (2) = ... = (n) =  ; µ(1) = µ(2) = ... = µ(n) = µ .

(9.113)

This makes little difference in the general case for the invariants, but simplifies the discussion of symmetries.

Remark 16. As for invariants, our general discussion of Sect.7.1 holds true, and we will

have invariants only in the case F = c; the only difference is that in the case with constant

force, the form of the invariants get simplified, i.e. we have still (7.40), but now with

i = ci/µ.



As for symmetries, in fact, with the assumption (9.113) the coefficients of the would-be symmetry vector fields are

n

i = i(u, t) +

Rij xj ,

j=1

n

i = i(t) +

Rij µ wj -  xj ;

F j xk

= 0.

(9.118)

The consequences of this relation depend on the detailed form of F (e.g., for F = c this is identically satisfied).

9.1 Regular and fully regular force field

Our discussion above suggests the following definition.

Definition 1. If the matrix (DxF ) with entries (DxF )jk = F j/xk is non-singular, we say that the force field F(x) is regular.

Remark 17. The case F = c is not regular; in the linear case F i(x) = Lijxj + Ki, the

regularity of F corresponds to the regularity of the matrix L.



For F regular, (9.118) implies that the matrix

(Du) = i/uj

is identically zero, which in turn implies i(u, t) = i(t) .

(9.119)

In this case we thus have

i = i(t) +

It is convenient to define symmetric matrices F(i) with entries

=

,

so that the relation (9.127) reads

F (i)  = 0 .

G. Gaeta (9.128) (9.129)

This suggests a new definition.

Definition 2. Consider a vector force field F(x) in Rn and its associated matrices F(i) defined by (9.128); if all the n matrices F(i) are regular, we say we say that F(x) is second order fully regular. If at least one of the matrices F(i) is regular, we say that F(x) is second order regular.

Remark 18. Note that if F is second order regular, then it is necessarily also regular.

On the other hand, linear vector fields provide a simple example of F which is regular but

not second order regular.



Remark 19. Consider F of the functional form

F i(x) = h(|x|) xi ,

with h a nonzero function. In this case we have an isotropic force field, which actually

descends from an isotropic potential H(|x|). It is easily seen that F is regular, and that

F is also second order regular unless h is constant, i.e. unless F is linear. This, albeit a

special case in mathematical terms, is of course a relevant one in physical ones; it provides

justification for focusing on the regular or second order regular case.



9.2 Symmetries
We are now ready to give a full description of symmetries for force fields which are second order regular or at least regular.

9.2.1 Case A: second order regular F

As already remarked, the relation (9.127) with our notation reads (9.129). If F is second order regular, we act on this by (F(i))-1 and obtain k = 0 for all k = 1, ..., n.
In view of (9.124), this also entails k = 0. We have already seen that R = 0. Thus only
odd-numbered elements of R can be nonzero, i.e. we have only the n ghost symmetries

X0(k)

=

zk

 zk

.

(9.130)

We will disregard these for the same reason as in the one-dimensional case. We conclude that:

Lemma 9.1. In the isotropic case and for F second order regular, the equation (6.24) has no real simple symmetry.

Symmetry of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process

27

9.2.2 Case B: linear and regular F

We consider next the case where F is linear and regular; thus

F i(x) = Lij xj + Ki

with L a regular matrix. Then (9.126) is just

d2i dt2

+



di dt

= Lij j .

(9.131)

By assumption, L is regular; we denote by M the diagonalizing matrix, i.e. the constant
matrix such that M -1 L M = diag (1), ..., (n) :=  .

With the change of variables

i

=

M

i j

j

the equation (9.131) reads

M

i j

d2i dt2

+



di dt

=

Li j

M

j k

k

;

acting from the left by M -1 this becomes

d2i dt2

+



di dt

=

M -1 L M

i j

j

=

ij j .

The system consists then of n decoupled equations, each in the form

d2i dt2

+



di dt

=

(i) i .

Setting now the shorthand notation

±(i)

:=

1 2

±

we have solutions

2 + 4 (i) ,

i(t) = K+(i) exp[-(+i)t] + K-(i) exp[--(i)t] .

The functions i(t) are then reconstructed by

(9.132)

i(t)

=

M

i j

j (t)

=

M

i j

K+(i) exp[-(+i)t] + K-(i) exp[-(-i)t]

,

and it follows immediately

i(t)

=

di dt

=

-

M

i j

K+(i) (+i) exp[-+(i)t] + K-(i) (-i) exp[-(-i)t]

.

We thus have 2n symmetries, which are read from the above by setting only one of

the

2n

constants

K±(i)

different

from

zero.

Note

that

±

and

M

i j

are

constants;

thus

it

is

immediate to see that all these symmetries commute with each other.

28

G. Gaeta

Remark 20. Actually, in this case we can proceed in a simpler way: that is, change coordinates via the matrix M in the original equation (6.24); then in the new (x, v; z, w) coordinates obtained via

x = M x , v = M v; z = M z , w = M w

the matrix L is diagonal, and the system reduces to

dxi = vi dt

,

dvi = (i) xi -  vi dt + µ dwi .

Note here we are using the fact that the matrices

(9.133)

B = diag((1), ..., (n)) ,  = diag(µ(1), ..., µ(n))

are actually multiples of the identity, B = I,  = µI, as we are in the isotropic case. We thus have n identical copies of the one dimensional case studied in Sect.8, and we
have an immediate extension of (8.104), i.e. in these coordinates the Abelian Lie algebra of symmetries is spanned by the vector fields

X+(i) = e-+t

 xi

-

+

 vi

,

X-(i) = e--t

 xi

-

-

 vi

,

(9.134)

with i = 1, ..., n.



We summarize our discussion as follows:
Lemma 9.2. In the n-dimensional isotropic case and for F regular but not second order regular, the equation (6.24) has 2n real simple symmetries, given in (9.134); these span an Abelian Lie algebra.

9.2.3 Case C: constant F

F i(x) = ci ,

the reduced equations (9.116), (9.117) read

Obviously (9.139) yields i(t) = Ki e-t
with Ki arbitrary constants. On the other hand, (9.138) requires

(9.140)

i(u, t) = i(t) + i(1, ..., n) := (t) dt + i(1, ..., n)

(9.142)

These are, of course, just the functions identified as basic invariants in the isotropic case with constant force field, see eq. 7.40 and Remark 16.
Recalling now that (due to R = 0) we have

i = i(u, t) = i(t) + Aij uj , i = i(t) ,

(9.143)

and recalling also that, due to Proposition 4.2, any symmetry vector field can be multiplied by a scalar function of the invariants, we have two types of symmetry vector fields, depending on an arbitrary function of the , i.e.:

X(i) = (1, ..., n) e-t

 xi

-



 vi

(9.144)

Y(i)

=

(1, ..., n)

 xi

.

(9.145)

We thus have an infinite dimensional Lie algebra of symmetries, G; this is two-dimensional as a Lie module over the ring of invariants {1, ..., n}.

The commutation relations in G are given by

Xf(i) , Xg(j) Yf(i) , Yg(j) Xf(i) , Yg(j)

= X((i)/µ)(fj g) .

We summarize our discussion as follows:

Lemma 9.3. In the n-dimensional isotropic case and for F i(xb) = ci, the equation (6.24) has an infinite dimensional Lie algebra of symmetries G, spanned by vector fields of the form (9.144), (9.145). The set G is 2n-dimensional as a Lie module over the ring of invariants, the latter being generated by {1, ..., n} defined in (9.142). The fields defined in (9.144) and in (9.145) form two subalgebras in G. The subalgebra spanned by (9.144) is an Abelian ideal in G, and a submodule of dimension n.

Remark 21. The results obtained for constant external force in the isotropic case are

essentially equivalent, modulo the slightly different form of the invariants i, to those

obtained in the general case, see Lemma 7.3.

10 Symmetry integration of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process

As recalled in Sect.2, the main motivation to study symmetries of a stochastic equations (and to restrict to simple symmetries) lies in that symmetries allow to integrate, or at least reduce, the stochastic equation.
In our case, the discussion of Sect.9 shows that there are symmetries only for F constant or linear, so we have only to analyze these cases. Actually, in both these cases we have ­ directly in the constant case, and in general upon a change of coordinates in the linear case, see Remark 20 ­ a collection of one-degree-of-freedom problems. We can thus just study this kind of problems.

Regular linear F

We will start from (9.133), and actually, for ease of notation, just consider one of the subsystems in which this splits, i.e.

dxi = vi dt dvi = [(i) xi -  vi] dt + µ dwi .

(10.146)

The symmetry analysis conducted above, and whose results are summarized in Lemma 9.2, tells us that for each degree of freedom (i.e. for each fixed i = 1, ..., n) we have two
symmetry vector fields, given by (9.134). WE should then pass to symmetry-adapted variables, i.e. to variables y±i such that

X±(i)

=

 y±i

.

It is rather clear this will not need to mix the different indices i, i.e. we will have for each i = 1, ..., n a change of variables

(xi, vi)  (y+i , y-i ) .

(10.147)

This is determined by requiring the variables ypi m to satisfy the system of equations

X+(i)(y+i ) = 1, X+(i)(y-i ) = 0 ; X-(i)(y+i ) = 0, X-(i)(y-i ) = 1 .

(10.148)

As the X±(I) are first order differential operators, the equations are promptly solved by the method of characteristics through standard computations. The final outcome is that the general solution to (10.148) is provided by

y+i

=

exp[(+i)t] -(i) - (+i)

((-i) x

+

v)

+

J+(i)(t) ,

y-i

=

exp[(-i)t] +(i) - (-i)

((+i) x

+

v)

+

J-(i)(t) ,

(10.149)

where J±(i)(t) are arbitrary functions, which might be set to zero for the sake of simplicity. It is immediate to check these variables satisfy (10.148); moreover we have X±(i)(y±j ) = 0 for i = j.

Symmetry of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process

31

We should now determine what is the dynamics undergone by the y±i when (xi, vi) evolve according to (10.146). For this, it suffices to apply the Ito rule taking into account
the spacial form of the diffusion matrix .
This gives at first a rather involved formula, which we do not report here, in which the coefficients (±i) appear. When we substitute for these according to (9.132), we get

dy+i

=

(J+(i))(t) dt

-

exp[(1/2)( + 2 + 4(i)t)] µ dwi 2 + 4(i)

:= (J+(i))(t) dt + (+i) dwi ,

dy-i

=

exp[(1/2)( - (J-(i))(t) dt +

2 + 4(i)t)] µ dwi

2 + 4(i)

:= (J-(i))(t) dt + (-i) dwi .

The solutions are therefore easily expressed in terms of Ito integrals,

(10.150)

y+(i)(t) = J+(i)(t) + (+i) dwi(t) ,

y-(i)(t) = J-(i)(t) + (-i) dwi(t) .

(10.151)

It suffices then to invert the change of variables (10.147) to give the solution in terms of the original (xi, vi) variables.

Remark 22. It may be of some interest to discuss what would happen if one is not
passing directly to symmetry adapted variables by looking for solutions to (10.148), but proceeds in a less systematic way. The form of the vector fields X±(i) suggests to operate a linear change of variables, and pass to consider

y±i = A(±i) xi + vi ,

(10.152)

with A± = ± the constants defined in (9.132). For these variables we have, under the dynamics (10.146) and applying the Ito rule,

dy±i = A(±i) dxi + dvi

=

A(±i) -  y±i +

(i) -

A(±i) -  A(±i) xi

dt + µ dwi .

The coefficient of xidt in the r.h.s. vanishes for A(±i) = (1/2)( ± 2 + 4 (i)), i.e. exactly for

A(±i) = (±i) .

(10.153)

That is, under (10.146) we have that with the choice (10.153) the variables defined in (10.152) evolve according to

dy+i = B+(i) y+i dt + µ dwi , dy-i = B-(i) y-i dt + µ dwi ,

(10.154)

32

G. Gaeta

where the constants B±(i) are defined as

B±(i) := (±i) -  .

(10.155)

We have thus reached a separation of variables.

It should be noted that we do not have equations in integrable form; this corresponds

to the fact we have not taken variables which are fully adapted to the vector fields X±(i),

as we disregarded the pre-factor exp[-±t] in them.3



Constant F
In the case of constant external force, F i = ci, we have
dxi = vi dt dvi = [ci -  vi] dt + µ dwi .

(10.156)

We have seen that the symmetry Lie module (over the ring of invariants, generated by {1, ..., n}) is generated by the vector fields

X(i) = e-t

 xi

-



 vi

,

Y (i)

=

 xi

.

(10.157)

Now, instead than going through the long and detailed steps followed in the case of linear force, we look directly for rectifying variables, i.e. for variables (zi, yi) such that

X(i)(zi) = 1 , X(i)(yi) = 0 ; Y (i)(zi) = 0 , Y (i)(yi) = 1 .

(10.158)

By a standard computation (with the method of characteristics) these are given by

zi = - et vi , yi = xi + vi .





(10.159)

We can then compute, by a standard application of Ito formula, the equations satisfied by (zi, yi) if (xi, vi) evolve according to (10.156). These turn out to be

dzi

=

-

et 

[c dt

+

µ dw]

dyi

=

1 

[c dt

+

µ dw]

.

(10.160) (10.161)

Both equations are immediately integrated, the solutions being expressed in terms of Ito integrals,

zi(t)

zi(t0)

et - et0

yi(t)

=

yi(t0)

(10.162) (10.163)

3We could then look for a second change of variables, in the form z±i = q±(i) exp[(±i) t]y±i with q±(i) constants and with (±i) such to get an integrable equation for z±i . In this way we reach of course the same result as above.

11 Conclusions

In the first part of the paper, up to Sect.5, we have recalled some basic facts about invariants and symmetries of stochastic equations, and their use.
We have then studied, from Sect.6 on, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in an external field, paying attention to invariants and to determination of its symmetries. The specific form of the equations (6.24) under study implies the presence of "ghost" (as opposed to "true" or "real") symmetries, related to variables appearing in the general formalism but not in the equations; these have not been considered. Moreover, we are only interested in simple Lie symmetries, in the sense ­ and for the reasons ­ discussed in Sect.2.
We have first discussed the problem in full generality, i.e. in dimension n and for the possibly non-isotropic case. For invariants this led to general conclusions in the case of constant or linear force; see Lemmas 7.1 and 7.2. For symmetries, this led to reduced formulas for the possible functional form of coefficients in symmetry vector fields, see (7.68) and (7.69); and to reduced determining equations, see (7.70) and (7.71). A complete result can be obtained in the case of constant force field, see Lemma 7.3, but little can be said for a general system.
We have then passed to consider more specifically the isotropic case; see Remark 16 for the exact sense of "isotropic" in this context.
We have preliminarily discussed the one-dimensional case, giving full details of the computations. In this case it turns out that for a nonlinear force field F (x) there are no simple symmetries, while for F (x) linear there are two (commuting) real simple Lie symmetries; and for F (x) constant (in which case we know a nontrivial invariant  exist) we have an infinite dimensional Lie symmetry algebra with the structure of a Lie module over C(); the infinite dimensional Lie algebra has an (infinite dimensional) Abelian ideal, which is also a Lie submodule. These results for the one-dimensional case are summarized in Lemmas 8.1 through 8.4.
We have then considered the general n-dimensional isotropic case. The discussion and the required computations are conceptually similar to those needed in the one-dimensional case; we have thus been less detailed in reporting our computations. On the other hand, the concept of nonlinear and linear forces are not sufficient to classify the different possibilities, unless we restrict ourselves to considering regular and second order regular force fields, as defined in Sect.9.1. We found again that a (second order regular) nonlinear force field f (x) leads to no simple symmetries (Lemma 9.1), while for (regular) linear f (x) we have an Abelian symmetry algebra of dimension 2n (Lemma 9.2). In the case of constant force fields, we have an infinite dimensional Lie symmetry algebra with the structure of a Lie module of dimension 2n over C(); again the infinite dimensional Lie algebra has an (infinite dimensional) Abelian ideal, which is also a Lie submodule (Lemma 9.3).
The results obtained here are preliminary to integration of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for particles in an (isotropic) external field. This is based on the ­ by now well established ­ symmetry theory of stochastic differential equations, and in particular on Kozlov theory [29­31]. Obviously this integration can take place only if symmetries are present, i.e. only in the case where the force field is linear or constant. In Sect.10 we have shown indeed that in these cases, passing to symmetry-adapted variables, integration is straightforward.
