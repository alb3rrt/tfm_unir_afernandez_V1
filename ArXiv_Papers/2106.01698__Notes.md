## Abstract

We recommended a new method from different perspective for the production of Ac-227, Ra-228, Th-228 and U-232 radioisotopes which have an important potential for use in radioisotope power systems (instead of Pu-238) and nuclear batteries, based on long half-life, high power density and low radiation level. In the method, the production of Ac-227, Ra-228, Th-228 and U-232 radioisotopes were performed by particle accelerators on Th-232 targets, instead of uranium, thorium, actinium series etc. in nuclear reactors. For this aim, to produce Ac-227, Ra-228, Th-228 and U-232 radioisotopes, we calculated cross-section and integral yields curves and simulated activities and yields of product for each reaction process under special conditions, such as during irradiation of 24 h in a particle beam current of 1 mA for the energy range of Eprojectile=1000-1 MeV. The obtained data were compared with experimental EXFOR database and theoretical TENDL database in detail. The cross-section, activity and yields results of each nuclear reaction process were analyzed and discussed in terms of the suitable production of Ac-227, Ra-228, Th-228 and U-232 radioisotopes.
