Magnetic properties of A2BB'O6 (A = rare or alkaline earth ions; B,B' = transition metal ions) double perovskites are of great interest due to their potential spintronic applications. Particularly fascinating is the zero field cooled exchange bias (ZEB) effect observed for the hole doped La2-xAxCoMnO6 polycrystalline samples. In this work we synthesize La2CoMnO6, La1.5Ca0.5CoMnO6, and La1.5Sr0.5CoMnO6 single crystals by the floating zone method and study their magnetic behavior. The three materials are ferromagnetic. Surprisingly, we observe no zero or even conventional exchange bias effect for the Ca and Sr doped single crystals, in sharp contrast to polycrystalline samples. This absence indicates that the lack of grain boundaries and spin glass-like behavior, not observed in our samples, might be key ingredients for the spontaneous exchange bias phenomena seen in polycrystalline samples.

I. INTRODUCTION
Materials displaying general formula A2BB'O6 (A = rare or alkaline earth ions; B,B' = transition metal ions) and double perovskite structure present intriguing physical phenomena due to the interplay between structural, magnetic and electrical properties1. There is great interest in this family of compounds due to the possible applications in spintronic devices. Particularly interesting is the zero field cooled exchange bias (ZEB) effect recently observed for hole doped members of this family of compounds2­9. The conventional exchange bias (CEB) effect is characterized as a shift in hysteresis loop measurements, observed after cooling the system in the presence of an external magnetic field10. In materials in which the ZEB effect is seen, the shift in magnetization as a function of the applied field is detected spontaneously in zero field cooling2­9. In these double perovskites, the ZEB effect may result from a reentrant spin glass-like phase, in which magnetic relaxation of unusual glassy moments affects the magnetization loop shifts11,12.
The intrinsic magnetic inhomogeneity caused by different transition metal ions in double perovskites commonly leads to spin-glass-like behavior, making these materials good candidates to understand the mechanisms ruling the ZEB effect. The crystal structure of A2BB'O6 double perovskites is significantly influenced by the A, B, and B' cations and their ionic radii size mismatch. One can describe this mismatch by the Goldschmidt tolerance factor t, where t = (rA + rO)/ 2(< rB > +rO) and rA, < rB >, and rO are the ionic radii of A, average of B/B' and O, respectively13. The ideal tolerance factor is given by t = 1, which denotes the cubic rock-salt ordered, space group F m-3m, structure. While t < 1 indicates that the A cation ionic radii are smaller than ideal, and the structure compensates for its size mismatch by tilting the BO6/B'O6 octahedra. By decreasing slightly the tolerance factor the structure

typically evolves to lower crystal symmetries as F m3mI4/mR-3I2/mP 21/n1. For ordered structures, a perfect sequence of B­O­B' chains are formed, whereas when the disorder is present, a random distribu-
tion of B and B' cations in which B­O­B, B­O­B' and B'­O­B' chains can occur. In disordered double per-
ovskites, the ideal structure is the P m-3m space group, while the most common is P nma1.

The La2-xAxCoMnO6 (A = Ca, Sr; x = 0, 0.5) family of compounds have been studied over many years. The
parent La2CoMnO6 (LCMO) material is known to show ferromagnetic behavior due to superexchange Co2+­O­ Mn4+ coupling, according to Goodenough-KanamoriAnderson (GKA) rules14,15, with potential multiferroic properties16,17. The Curie temperature (TC) for ordered samples can reach up to 226 K18 with a saturation spin
moment Msat = 6 µB/f.u., while the disordered ones, e.g.
with oxygen deficiency and/or antisite defects, present lower TC and Msat2,18,19. If changes in the B-cations valence also occur, a Co3+­O­Mn3+ ferromagnetic inter-
action may happen, and a distinct ferromagnetic transition is present5,14,17,18. Also, the disorder can gen-
erate antiferromagnetic clusters, giving rise to an anti-
ferromagnetic transition temperature TN because of exchange Co3+­O­Mn4+ coupling and/or antiphase boundaries of Co2+­Co2+ or Mn4+­Mn4+ pairs14,20. Regard-
ing its crystal structure, LCMO is mostly described as
a monoclinic P 21/n space group for an ordered popula-
tion of the B-sites, and orthorhombic P nma when the disorder is present5,18.

For

La1.5Ca0.5CoMnO6

(LCCMO)

and

La1.5Sr0.5CoMnO6 (LSCMO) materials, it has been reported in polycrystalline samples that by substituting

the La3+ cation by 25% of an alkaline earth ion with 2+

valence, gives rise to a spin glass phase which promotes

the unusual ZEB effect2,3,5,7,11,12. It was also shown

that Ba doping can tune the ZEB effect in LSCMO21.

In polycrystalline LCCMO, a phase segregation with

mixture of two P nma space groups in 94% and 6% concentrations was seen, while LSCMO showed 91% of rhombohedral R3-c and 9% of P nma phases5. Magnetic properties of both samples showed two ferromagnetic (TC ) and one antiferromagnetic (TN ) temperature transitions, TC1  158 K, TC2  141 K and TN  62 K, for LCCMO; and TC1  180 K, TC2  157 K and TN  74 K, for LSCMO . Both polycrystalline compounds exhibit the onset of cluster glass behavior at lower temperatures due to the presence of competing magnetic phases5.
Here we present our study on single crystalline LCMO, LCCMO, and LSCMO compounds, where we investigate their structural and magnetic properties, comparing their characteristics with the polycrystals. All samples are ferromagnetic below TC , with a clear indication of two ferromagnetic transitions for LCMO and LCCMO. Changes in TC between these oxides are accounted for structural modifications of the B-O-B bound angle, B-O bond length, and crystallinity. We observe no glassy-like phase for the three materials and the absence of the ZEB effect for LCCMO and LSCMO. Therefore, the nonexistence of grain boundaries and spin glass-like behavior indicate that these are critical ingredients for the spontaneous exchange bias phenomena seen in polycrystalline samples.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
Polycrystalline powders of LCMO, LCCMO, and LSCMO materials were synthesized via solid-state reaction, details of the process have been reported elsewhere5. The crystal growths were carried out by the floating zone technique using two different 2-mirror image furnaces (NEC SC1MDH-11020 Canon Machinery Inc. and Quantum Design IR Image Furnace), in air. The feed rods needed for the crystal growths were hydrostatically pressed up to 50 MPa into the form of cylindrical rods and sintered in air at 1300C for 12 h (LCMO), 1300C for 24 h (LCCMO), and 1400C for 24 h (LSCMO). Crystals were grown at a rate of 3 to 5 mm/h with the feed and seed rods, each rotating at 20 rpm in opposite directions. The structural properties of the samples were investigated by conventional x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) measurements using a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer with Cu-K radiation ( = 1.5406 °A). All data were collected in BraggBrentano geometry in the continuous mode with 2 range from 20 to 80, step size of 0.013, and a scanning speed of 0.5/min. Rietveld refinements were performed using the GSAS+EXPGUI suite22. X-ray Laue backscattering patterns were recorded using a commercial Photonic Science Laue System, for cutting and aligning the samples along different directions for magnetic measurements. Roughly, 5 mm size single crystals were extracted from the crystal boules. Magnetic and thermal properties characterization was carried out using a Quantum Design PPMS equipment.

III. RESULTS
A. Structural characterization
Figure 1 shows the XRPD patterns collected on LCMO, LCCMO, and LSCMO samples. These powdered samples were obtained by powdering a small section of the as-grown boule and measured at room temperature. For the three samples all the Bragg peaks could be indexed using the double perovskite structure model and no impurity peaks could be observed.. The crystal structure was indexed with orthorhombic symmetry, space group P nma, for the LCMO and LCCMO; while LSCMO is rhombohedral, space group R-3c. Lattice parameters (see Table I) are in good agreement with the data reported for polycrystalline samples on literature5.
Figure 2 shows the x-ray Laue back-scattering patterns of the three LCMO, LCCMO, and LSCMO samples, after the as-grown single crystal boules [Fig. 2(d)] were oriented and cut along the [001] crystalline direction. Fig. 2(b) presents better-defined diffraction spots resulting from a more homogeneous sample. It indicates that the proximity between La3+ and Ca2+ ionic radii leads to a better accommodation of these ions in the LCCMO

structure than LSCMO resulting from the incorporation of large Sr2+ ions. The LCCMO has less residual stress and better crystal quality manifested in the goodness of fit parameters obtained from the Rietveld refinements (see Table I).
B. Magnetic properties
The zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) temperature dependent magnetization of the LCMO, LCCMO, and LSCMO materials are shown in Fig. 3, under an applied magnetic field (H) of 0.1 kOe along the [001] direction. No appreciable qualitative changes were observed for H  [001] for all samples (not shown). The magnetic irreversibility of the ZFC and FC curves observed at the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition for LCMO, LCCMO, and LSCMO is usually ascribed to a glassy-like magnetic behavior. Especially for LCMO and LCCMO, the ZFC magnetization only starts to grow at around T = 75 K.
In order to investigate this hypothesis, were performed measurements of ac susceptibility in-phase component

() as a function of temperature, as shown in Fig. 4. Although some changes in the intensities of the ac curves could be noticed in the low temperature side of the peaks carried at different frequencies, no systematic variations in the temperature of the peaks were observed, indicating no canonical glassy phase nor relevant dynamic effects23. Conversely, this indicates that such frequency dependence of the ac intensity is most likely related to the onset of a second ferromagnetic transition extended over a broad temperature range, as will be discussed in the next section. The magnetic irreversibility observed can be attributed to the domain wall motion de-pinning process, as previously seen in other double perovskites single crystals24,25. Table II summarises the magnetic ordering transition temperatures for all studied materials. We could not obtain the effective moment nor the Curie-Weiss temperature due to limitations of the maximum temperature measured (T = 400 K), preventing a good linear fit in the paramagnetic region. Nevertheless, this is an indication of short-range magnetic correlations even at temperatures well above the ordering temperatures.

Figure 5 shows the magnetization hysteresis loop at T = 5 K and up to H = 90 kOe for LCMO, LCCMO, and LSCMO. These curves were obtained after zero field cooled the samples. A sharp ferromagnetic-like hysteresis is seen for all three samples, and the magnetization saturates at MS  6 µB/f.u for H > 40 kOe. We see no hysteresis loop shifts, i.e., no ZEB effect, for LCCMO and LSCMO single crystals (see right side inset Fig. 5), in contrast to what was observed in polycrystals2­5,7,9. Also, we do not observe the conventional EB effect, after FC, for all samples (not shown). A metamagnetic transition can be noticed for LCCMO (see left side inset Fig. 5).
IV. DISCUSSION
A. LCMO
Regarding the magnetic properties, for LCMO, we observe two ferromagnetic transitions, a majority ferromagnetic phase at TC  150(1) K and a minority ferromag-

netic phase at TC  116(2) K, as seen from the FC curve in Fig. 3. TC is similar as reported before for single crystals24,26. These magnetic phase transitions are supported by zero magnetic field heat capacity measure-
ment, showing one broad peak at approximately 116 K and another sharper at around 150 K (see inset of Fig.
3). In polycrystals it was seen by x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements the presence of mixed valence Co (Co2+/Co3+) and Mn (Mn3+/Mn4+)5,27. Thus, by the GKA rules14, one can ascribe these ferromagnetic orderings as result of Co2+­O­Mn4+ (TC ) and Co3+­O­Mn3+ (TC ) superexchange interactions, with TC > TC 5,18,27. The presence of Co3+ and Mn3+ was already reported for LCMO solution grown single crystals26. The ac sus-
ceptibility (Fig. 4) shows a frequency-independent peak, within the experimental resolution, approximately at 150
K. However, no peak is observed at around 116 K. This indicates that at TC a long-range magnetic order sets in, while at TC the Co3+­O­Mn3+ exchange interaction has more a short-range character. The small frequency
dependence for 125 < T < 150 K indicates slow spin dynamics, which is not characteristic of a canonical glassy behavior and may be due to domain-wall motion.
Figure 5 shows a sharp ferromagnetic magnetization hysteresis loop (up to H = 90 kOe) which saturates
at MS = 6.3(1) µB/f.u. and has remanent magnetization MR = 2.4(1) µB/f.u. (see Table II). For the fully ordered LCMO one would expect only the Co2+­ O­Mn4+ exchange interaction and MS = 6 µB/f.u, consistent with the sum of Co2+ (3d7, S = 3/2) and Mn4+ (3d3, S = 3/2) states per formula unit18. Since the
temperature dependence of magnetization of our single crystalline sample already gave us an indication of

5

mixed valence, we must take into account Co3+ and Mn3+ spins to the saturated experimental value. Considering, high spin Co3+ (3d6, S = 2), and Mn3+ (3d4, S = 2), one can estimate the amount of Co2+­O­Mn4+ and Co3+­O­Mn3+ couplings, by equating the expression MS = 6.3 = [(1 - x)(Co2++Mn4+) + x(Co3++Mn3+)], thus deriving that our LCMO sample has 15% of Co3+­ O­Mn3+ and 85% of Co2+­O­Mn4+ interactions. In this rough approximation, we are neglecting the cationic disorder-induced contributions of antiferromagnetic couplings, such as Mn4+­Mn4+, Co2+­Mn3+, Co2+­Co2+. And also ferromagnetic couplings, for example, Mn3+­ Mn4+. This consideration is a good approximation once H = 90 kOe may be sufficient to flip the great majority of the antiferromagnetic spins pointing toward the opposite direction to the external magnetic field.
B. LCCMO
By hole doping Ca2+ and Sr2+ into the La3+ site in the LCMO structure, one destabilizes the electron count, and in order to maintain charge neutrality, it is more likely that either some Mn3+ becomes Mn4+ or Co2+ transforms to Co3+. Previous x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements showed indications of a preference for the increase of the amount of Co3+ by alkaline-earth cations substitution in polycrystalline LCMO. At the same time, Mn maintaining its mean valence value5.
For LCCMO we observe a clear ferromagnetic transition at TC  165(2) K (Figs. 3 and 4), slightly greater than for LCMO. It is also noticed a broader second transition at TC  120 K. The MS = 6.8(1) µB/f.u. seen in Fig. 5 is also greater for LCCMO than for LCMO. Both results are due to the doping-induced electronic changes. Assuming that the Mn mean valence does not change with Ca doping, there should be an increase of 50% of Co3+ in respect to LCMO. One can calculate the expected saturation magnetization by the expression MS = [0.85Mn4+ + 0.15Mn3+ + (0.85 - 0.50)Co2+ + (0.15 + 0.50)Co3+], which gives MS = 6.8 µB/f.u., exactly the obtained experimental value. The increased disorder caused by changes in the valence of the transition metal ions prevents the percolation of the Co3+­O­ Mn3+ coupling. This transition might be smeared over a wide temperature range (see inset Fig. 3) as seen for the frequency dependence of  at 125 < T < 150 K (Fig. 4).
Left inset of Fig. 5 highlights a step-like character in the M (H) curve of LCCMO at T  5 K. Such behavior was reported for similar compounds, in which different mechanisms were said to explain such effect. For Tb2CoMnO6 and Eu2CoMnO6 this step-like behavior was initially explained in terms of a field-induced metamagnetic transition from ferrimagnetism to ferromagnetism in the Co2+­O­Mn4+ coupling28. Nevertheless, later on a more recent detailed investigation employing neutron powder diffraction ruled out such possibility29. In this study, the metamagnetic transition was explained

in terms of the presence of a spin-glass-like phase and of the magnetic ordering of rare-earth ions in a direction distinct to those of Co, and Mn29,30. In our case, in contrast to these hypotheses, the A-site ions are diamagnetic, and no sign of a spin-glass-like phase is observed. Thus, the characteristic feature observed in the M (H) curve of LCCMO may be justified in terms of the two distinct ferromagnetic couplings contributions for the total magnetization.
C. LSCMO
The LSCMO sample present TC  205(2) K (Table II), and a second ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic transition at lower temperatures is not clear, in contrast to polycrystals3,5. As in LCCMO, one would expect an increase of the Co valence, though, for LSCMO, the saturated magnetization is slightly smaller (MS = 6.5(1) µB/f.u.), indicating that not only Co but also Mn valence changes. If we assume that in LSCMO, all 15% of Mn3+ becomes Mn4+, then only 35% of Co2+ shifts into Co3+. Thus, MS = [(0.85 + 0.15)Mn4+ + (0.15 - 0.15)Mn3+ +(0.85-0.50)Co2++(0.15+0.50)Co3+] = 6.5 µB/f.u., the same value that the experimental magnetization saturates (Fig. 5). However, the little frequency dependence in the in-phase component of the ac susceptibility at low temperatures indicates an almost negligible amount of Mn3+ may be present. In such a case, the diluted Co3+­Mn3+ interaction would be then pushed to lower temperatures in respect to LCMO and LCCMO (Fig. 4).
The ferromagnetic temperature transition TC increases for doped LCCMO and LSCMO regarding the undoped LCMO. Possible explanations to this, which might be counterintuitive, once doping causes disorder and also significantly promotes some Co2+ to Co3+, may come from the crystal structure properties of these A2BB'O6 materials. The effect of the transition metal exchange interaction (B-O-B) orbital overlapping geometry is more critical to strengthen TC than disorder is to weaken it20. Therefore, one suitable structural parameter for this analysis is the B-O-B bound angle and the B-O bond length. The closer the bond angle is to 180 and the shorter is the bond length, the higher is TC .
D. Conclusions
Considering the ionic radii of the following elements as being equal to La3+ (1.36 °A), Ca2+ (1.34 °A), Sr2+ (1.44 °A) [XII coordination]; Co2+ (0.745 °A), Co3+ (0.61 °A), Mn3+ (0.645 °A), Mn4+ (0.53 °A) [VI coordination]; and O2- (1.35 °A) [II coordination]31, one can calculate the tolerance factor for each material as defined in the introduction. The stable perovskite structure is guaranteed by 0.89 < t < 1.02 and as t decreases, the crystalline lattice becomes rhombohedral (0.96 < t < 1) and orthorhombic

6

(t < 0.96)32. As in previous polycrystalline samples5, the parent LCMO compound has orthorhombic symmetry. The calculated tolerance factor for this material is t  0.96, in agreement with the observed P nma space group. For LCCMO, we see a decrease of the bond angle and an increase of the bond length (see Table I). The calculated t  0.98 indicates a preference for a rhombohedral atomic arrangement, though experimentally, we find the orthorhombic structure. However, the greater structural distortion due to doping gives rise to the tilting of the oxygen octahedra and accommodates the ions better in the crystal lattice, explaining the higher crystal homogeneity of the LCCMO sample when compared to LCMO and LSCMO [see Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 2(b) for sharper diffraction peaks and spots, respectively]. This higher degree of crystallinity could describe the small increase in TC, despite reduced bond angle and elongated bond length regarding LCMO. The calculated t  0.99 for LSCMO produces a more symmetric rhombohedral crystal structure, and the bond angle is closer to 180 giving rise to the highest TC.
Despite many works on the ZEB effect in polycrystalline Ca2+ and Sr2+ doped LCMO, our single crystals showed no signatures of such effect (right inset Fig. 5). Neither did we observe the conventional magnetization as a function of applied field shift by cooling the materials under an external magnetic field. One key difference between poly and single crystals is the lack of grain boundaries in the latter, in which the number of interfaces is drastically reduced. It is well established that the exchange bias effect is an interface phenomenon between different magnetic phases, usually a ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic uncompensated moment interface10. Thus, in a single magnetic phase single crystal, it is expected that no conventional exchange bias effect is to be observed. The presence of a reentrant magnetic glassy-like phase would, however, change this scenario. The slow dynamics of the spin glass-like moments relaxation under a magnetic field would create an artificial interface of pinned moments, giving rise to the asymmetry in the hysteresis loops5,33­35. In our LCCMO and LSCMO samples, we see no such glassy-like phase. Therefore, the absence of the ZEB effect in single crystals attests to the need for a glassy magnetic phase for

its insurgence in these types of materials11,12. In addition, we see some probable correlation of the ZEB effect magnitude with the grain boundary size in polycrystals, and further studies should verify this.
V. SUMMARY
Here we present our work on the magnetic properties of single crystalline La2-xAxCoMnO6 (A = Ca, Sr; x = 0, 0.5) materials. The crystalline structure of the single crystals is the same as found for polycrystalline samples5, orthorhombic for LCMO and LCCMO, and rhombohedral for LSCMO. LCMO and LCCMO present two magnetic transitions ascribed to the Co2+­O­Mn4+ and Co3+­O­Mn3+ ferromagnetic couplings. For LSCMO, however, only one TC is clear, most likely due to Co2+­ O­Mn4+ long-range interaction. The increased TC of LCCMO (165 K) and LSCMO (205 K) in relation to LCMO (150 K) is primarily because of structural changes in crystallinity and bond angles and lengths. No zero or even conventional exchange bias effect is seen for the Ca and Sr doped single crystals, in sharp contrast to polycrystalline samples2­5. The absence of the ZEB effect might be due to the lack of a spin glass-like phase and/or grain boundary interfaces in these single crystals. Further studies on the spin dynamics may elucidate the nonexistence of the ZEB effect in single crystalline samples and give insights into the critical properties necessary for its appearance.
