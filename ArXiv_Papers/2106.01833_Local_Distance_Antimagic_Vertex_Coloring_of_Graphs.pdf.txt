Abstract
A bijective function f : V  {1, 2, 3, ..., |V |} is said to be a local distance antimagic labeling of a graph G = (V, E), if w(u) = w(v) for any two adjacent vertices u, v where the weight w(v) = zN(v) f (z). The local distance antimagic labeling of G induces a proper coloring in G, called local distance antimagic chromatic number denoted by ld(G). In this article, we introduce the parameter ld(G) and compute the local distance antimagic chromatic number of graphs.

1 Background and Introduction
Let G = (V, E) be a simple, connected, undirected graph with |V | = n and |E| = m. For graph theoretic terminology we refer to Chartrand and Lesniak [4]. A graph G is antimagic if m edges are distinctly labeled by positive integers 1, 2...|E| such that weight of each vertex (sum of the label of edges incident to that vertex) is distinct. The concept of antimagic labeling was introduced by Hartsfield and Ringel [8]. They conjectured that every connected graph other than K2 is antimagic and every tree other than K2 is antimagic. These conjectures gained more attention and results were established for several classes of graphs. In 2012, Arumugam and Kamatchi [1] introduced the term (a, d)distance antimagic labeling of graphs which is defined as follows: A bijective function f : V  {1, 2, 3, ..., n} is said to be (a, d)-distance antimagic labeling

if w(u) = w(v) for every vertex u and v, w(v) = uN(v) f (u) where each vertex weight forms an arithmetic progression {a, a + d, a + 2d, ..., a + (n - 1)d} with common weight difference d and minimum vertex weight a. A graph G is (a, d)-distance antimagic if G admits (a, d)-distance antimagic labeling. The (a, d)-distance antimagic labeling is distance antimagic if d  0. A bijective function f : V  {1, 2, 3, ..., n} be a distance antimagic labeling, if w(x) = w(y) for every two vertices x and y in V . A graph G is distance antimagic if G admits a distance antimagic labeling. In 2013, Kamatchi and Arumugam [12] proved that the cycles {Cn, n = 4}, the wheels {Wn, n = 4}, the paths {Pn} are distance antimagic graphs. Further they put forth the following conjectures that are yet open.
Conjecture 1.1. A graph G is distance antimagic if and only if N(u) = N(v) for any two distinct vertices u, v in V (G).
Conjecture 1.2. A tree T is distance antimagic if and only if every support vertex v has precisely one leaf adjacent to v.
Kamatchi et al. [13] proved hypercube and several classes of disconnected graphs are distance antimagic. Rinovia Simanjuntak, Kristiana Wijaya proved that sun graphs, prism graphs, complete graphs, wheel graphs, fans and friendship graphs are distance antimagic [16].
S. Arumugam et al. [2] introduced the local antimagic graphs induced by local antimagic labeling which is defined as follows: Let G = (V, E) be a graph. A bijective function f : E  {1, 2, 3, ..., m} is a local antimagic labeling, if for all uv  E, w(u) = w(v) where w(u) = eE(u) f (u). If G is local antimagic, then G has local antimagic labeling. The local antimagic chromatic number la(G) is the proper coloring of G induced by local antimagic labeling. They investigated the local antimagic chromatic number of tree la(T )  l + 1 and conjectured that every connected graph other than K2 is local antimagic and every tree other than K2 is local antimagic are still open. Further, they provided a local chromatic number of cycle graphs, complete bipartite graphs, friendship graphs, wheel graphs. John Haslegrave [10] proved the conjecture raised in [2], every connected graph other than K2 is local antimagic using the probabilistic method. Julien Bensmail et al. [11] positively proved the conjecture, every tree other than K2 is local antimagic raised in [2].
The corona product of graphs was introduced by Frucht and Harary in 1970 [7]. The corona product of two graphs G1 and G2 denoted by G1  G2 is constructed by taking one copy of G1 along with |V (G1)| copies of G2 and joining the i-th vertex of G1 to every vertex of i-th copy of G2, for 1  i  |V (G1)|. Note that Km denote the complement of Km, also called the null graph on m vertices.

Arumugam et al. [3] provided the local antimagic chromatic number for corona product of graphs G with Km for m  1. They proved that la(Pn Km) is mn + 2. Further they provided the local antimagic chromatic number for corona product of both graphs, the odd cycle Cn, n  5 and the complete Kn, n  3 with the null graph Km for m  2.
Motivated by these observations, we introduce a concept named a local distance antimagic labeling of graphs and a new parameter, local distance antimagic chromatic number its denotes ld(G).
Definition 1.3. A bijective function f : V  {1, 2, 3, ..., |V | = n} is local distance antimagic labeling for a graph G = (V, E), if w(u) = w(v) for any two adjacent vertices u and v, where w(v) = zN(v) f (z), N (v) is the open neighborhood of v. A graph G is local distance antimagic if G admits a local distance antimagic labeling. This induces a proper color where the vertex v is assigned the color w(v). This leads to the following concept.
Definition 1.4. Local distance antimagic chromatic number ld(G) is defined as the minimum number of colors required to proper color the graph induced by local distance antimagic labeling of G. If G is distance antimagic, then G is local distance antimagic.

Figure 1: Local distance antimagic chromatic number for K4,4
If G is distance antimagic, then G is local distance antimagic, but the converse is not true. We observe that the local distance antimagic chromatic number of the graph G shown in Figure 1 is ld(G) = 2 = (G).
The graph K2 is neither antimagic nor local antimagic. Many researchers tried hard to solve the conjecture in [8], [2], every connected graph other than K2 is antimagic and local antimagic, respectively. But K2, a magic graph. We observe that K2 is distance antimagic. All distance antimagic graphs are local distance antimagic, but the converse is not valid. Hence on achieving the local distance antimagic labeling on K2, we receive the minimum labels (v1, v2) with (1, 2) respectively, thus obtaining unique vertex colors. Therefore K2 is a local distance antimagic graph. Hence we start with the following observation.

Observation 1.5. Every connected graph is local distance antimagic.
Remark 1.6. ld(G)  (G). Then ld(G) - (G) is arbitrarily large is shown in the following theorems.
We provide a new concept to compute the local distance antimagic chromatic number of graphs in the following sections.
2 Main Results
2.1 Local Distance Antimagic Chromatic Number of Star Related Graphs
This section observed that the local distance antimagic graphs naturally provide the proper color induced by local distance antimagic labeling. Here we compute the local distance antimagic chromatic number of star-related graphs. We know that the chromatic number of star graph (Sn) is 2. The following Theorem provides the local distance antimagic chromatic number of star graph ld(Sn) is 2. Thus, we infer that ld(Sn) = (Sn).
Theorem 2.1. For a star graph Sn on n  2, we have ld(Sn) = 2.
Proof. Let G be a star graph Sn with n+ 1 vertices. Let V (G) = {c  vi, f or 1  i  n} and E(G) = {c vi, f or 1  i  n} where c is the internal vertex and vi are pendant vertices. We have |V (G)| = n + 1 and |E(G)| = n. We define a bijective function f : V  {1, 2, 3, ..., n + 1} by

f (c) = n + 1 f (vi) = i, for 1  i  n

Then the vertex weights are as follows

w(vi) = n + 1

w(c)

=

n(n + 2

1)

Thus ld(Sn) = 2. We know that, (Sn) = 2. Hence ld(Sn) = 2.

The Join of two graphs G = G1 + G2 is structured by adjoining every vertex at G1 to every vertex at G2. As an immediate consequences of Theorem 2.1, we proved the following Corollary.

Corollary 2.2. For the graph G = K1 + Kn, with n  1, we have ld(G) = 2.

Theorem 2.3. For a subdivision of star graph Snm with n  3, m = 1, we have ld(Snm) = n + 1.
Proof. Let V (Sn1) = {c  vij, f or 1  i  n, 1  j  2} and E(Sn1) = {c vij  vij vij+1, f or 1  i  n, j = 1}. Then |V (Sn1)| = 2n + 1 and |E(Sn1)| = 2n. Let us define a function f : V  {1, 2, 3, ..., 2n + 1} by

2n + 1,  f (vij) = n + i, i,

for i = 1, j = 1 for 2  i  n, j = 1 for 1  i  n, j = 2

f (c) = n + 1

Then the vertex weights are

w(c) = 2n + 1 + (n + i)

i=2

Thus, ld(Sn1)  n + 1. Suppose n = 3, the minimum possible vertex weight

w(c) =

n(n+1) 2

= 6, such that f (vi1) = 1, 2, ..., n.

Thus vertex c receives a first

color. vi2 are pendant vertices. Therefore, w(vi2) = 1, 2, ...n. Thus all pendant

vertices receives n colors. Hence, Sn1 receives n + 1 colors. Similarly we can prove

for

n

but

|V (Sn1)| = 2n + 1. Thus w(c) > |V (Sn1)|. Note that w(c) receives a new color.

Therefore, ld(Sn1)  n + 1. Hence for m = 1, ld(Snm) = n + 1.

The bistar Bn,n is a graph constructed by joining n pendant edges to endpoints of K2. Any bistar graphs are local distance antimagic, shown in the following Theorem.

Theorem 2.4. For any bistar graph Bn,n with n  2, we have ld(Bn,n) = 4.
Proof. Let V (Bn,n) = {u, v, ui, vi, f or 1  i  n} and E(Bn,n) = {uv  uui  vvi, f or 1  i  n}. We have |V (Bn,n)| = 2(n + 1) and |E(Bn,n)| = 2n + 1. Let f : V  {1, 2, ..., 2(n + 1)} be a bijective function defined by

f (u) =2n + 1 f (v) =2n + 2 f (ui) =i, for 1  i  n f (vi) =n + i, for 1  i  n

The weight of the vertices are

w(u)

+

w(v)

=

3n2

+ 5n 2

+

2

w(ui) =f (u)

w(vi) =f (v)

Thus ld(Bn,n)  4. The chromatic number of a bistar is (Bn,n) = 2. Suppose ld(Bn,n) = 2. The weight of the pendant vertex receives its adjacent vertex label. Therefore the graph receives w(ui) = f (u) and w(vi) = f (v). Thus there exists 2 colors. Then w(u) = f (ui) + f (v), meant that the weight of the vertex u is the sum of the labels of ui pendant vertices and f (v). Also w(v) = f (vi) + f (u). Therefore w(u) and w(v) receives two new colors, because u, v are adjacent vertices. Therefore ld(Bn,n)  4. Hence ld(Bn,n) = 4.
The Doublestar graph is obtained by joining the m pendant edges to one end of K2 and n pendant edges to the other end of K2, denoted by Bm,n. As an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.4, we proved the following Corollary.

Corollary 2.5. For any doublestar graph Bm,n, with m, n  2, we have ld(Bm,n) = 4.

Theorem 2.6. The subdivision of a bistar graph admits a local distance antimagic labeling, thus we have ld(BS(n, n)) = 4, for n  4.
Proof. For 1  i  n, consider V (BS(n, n)) = {c, u, v, ui, vi} and E((BS(n, n)) = {cu cv uui vvi}. Thus |V (BS(n, n))| = 2n+3 and |E((BS(n, n))| = 2(n+1). Let us define a bijective function f : V (BS(n, n)  {1, 2, 3, ..., 2n + 3} by Case 1: When n = 3

f (c) = 2n + 3 f (u) = 2n f (v) = 2(n + 1)

f (ui) =

2i - 1, 2i + 1,

for i = 1, 2 for i = 3

f (vi) =

2i, 2i - 1,

for i = 1, 2 for i = 3

6

Then the vertex weights are

w(c) =2(2n + 1) w(ui) =2n w(vi) =2(n + 1) w(u) = w(v) =5(n + 1)

Case 2: When n  5 and n is odd

f (c) = 6
f (u) = 2(n + 1)
f (v) = 2n + 3
2i - 1,  f (ui) = 2i + 1, 2i,
2i,  f (vi) = 2i - 1, 2i + 1,

for i = 1, 2 for 3  i  n, where i is odd for 4  i  n, where i is even
for i = 1, 2 and 5  i  n, where i is odd for i = 3 for 4  i  n, where i is even

Then the vertex weights are

w(c) =4n + 5

w(ui) =2(n + 1)

w(vi) =2n + 3

w(u)

=

w(v)

= n(2n

+ 3) 2

+

7

Case 3: When n  4 and n is even

f (c) = 2n + 1 f (u) = 2(n + 1) f (v) = 2n + 3

f (ui) =

2i - 1, 2i,

for 1  i  n, where i is odd for 1  i  n, where i is even

f (vi) =

2i, 2i - 1,

for 1  i  n, where i is odd for 1  i  n, where i is even

7

Then the vertex weights are

w(c) =4n + 5

w(ui) =2(n + 1)

w(vi) =2n + 3

w(u)

w(v)

= (4n

+

2)

Thus ld(BS(n, n))  4. We know that (BS(n, n)) = 2. If ld(BS(n, n)) = 2,

the weight of the pendant vertex receives the adjacent vertex label. Thus the

graph receives [w(ui) = f (u) and w(vi) = f (v)], 2-colors. The minimum possible

vertex

weight

w(u) =

(n+1)(n+2) 2

is

greater

than

|V (BS(n, n))|.

Similar

condition

is applied for w(v). Then w(u) = w(v) receives one new color. The weight w(c) =

w(ui) or w(vi) may occur, but the vertex weight w(c) = f (u) + f (v). We know the value of w(ui) and w(vi). Further w(c) = w(ui) or w(vi), vertex c receives another new color. Therefore ld(BS(n, n))  4. Hence ld(BS(n, n)) = 4.

The shadow graph D2[G] is constructed from two graphs G1 and G2 by joining the vertex v in G1 to the neighbours of corresponding vertex in G2. The following result provides the local distance antimagic chromatic number of the shadow
graph of a bistar.

Theorem 2.7. ld(D2[Bn,n]) = 5, where D2[Bn,n], n  2 is the shadow graph of a bistar graph.

Proof. Let V (D2[Bn,n]) = {u, v, u, v, ui, vi, ui, vi , f or 1  i  n} and E(D2[Bn,n]) = {u v  u ui  v vi  u ui  v vi  u ui  u ui  v vi  v vi, f or 1  i  n}. We have |V (D2[Bn,n])| = 4(n + 1) and |E(D2[Bn,n])| = 2(4n + 1). Define
f : V (D2[Bn,n])  {1, 2, 3, ..., 4(n + 1)} by

f (ui) = i, for 1  i  n f (vi) = 2n + i, for 1  i  n f (ui) = n + i, for 1  i  n f (vi ) = 3n + i, for 1  i  n f (u) = 4n + 1 f (v) = 2(2n + 1) f (u) = 4(n + 1) f (v) = 4n + 3

Figure 2: Local distance antimagic chromatic number of D2[B5,5]

Then the weight of the vertices are
w(u) = 2n2 + 5n + 2 w(v) = 6n2 + 5n + 1 w(u) = 2n2 + 5n + 3 w(v) = 6n2 + 5n + 4

Also w(ui) = w(vi) = w(ui) = w(vi ) = 8n + 5. Thus ld(D2[Bn,n])  5. Suppose w(u) = w(v), where u and v are non-adjacent vertices. The neighbours of the vertex u and v must receive same labels. This is not possible. There is a contradiction. Thus w(u) = w(v). Thus there exists two distinct colors. Similar argument satisfy for w(v) = w(u). All the 2- degree vertices receives a new color. Thus ld(D2[Bn,n])  5. Hence ld(D2[Bn,n]) = 5. Thus the shadow graph of any bistar can be induced properly by local distance antimagic exactly by five colors. Figure 2 shows the local distance antimagic chromatic number of D2[B5,5]
2.2 Local Distance Antimagic Chromatic Number of Complete k-partite Graphs
Rinovia Simanjuntak, Kristiana Wijaya [16] proved that complete graphs are distance antimagic. They proved that complete graphs admits (a, d)-distance antimagic if and only if d = 1. Further, in addition to that, they proved all complete multipartite graphs are not distance antimagic. Here in this section,
9

we proved that all complete k-partite graphs are local distance antimagic. We observe that ld(G) = (G), where G is a complete k-partite graphs.

Theorem 2.8. ld(Kn) = n, where Kn is a complete graph on n  3 vertices.

Proof. Let V (Kn) = {vi, f or 1  i  n} and E(Kn) = {vi vi+j  v1 vn, f or 1 

i  n - 1,

1j

 n - 2}.

Thus

we have |V (Kn)| = n and |E(Kn)| =

n(n-1) 2

.

Let us define a function f : V  {1, 2, 3, ..., n}, for i = 1, 2, ...n such that

f (vi) = i, f or 1  i  n.

Then the vertex weights are w(vi) =

n(n

+

1) 2

-

2i

.

Thus, ld(Kn)  n. We know that (Kn) = n. Hence, ld(Kn) = n.

Note that the line graph of a star graph is a complete graph. As a immediate consequences of Theorem 2.8, the following Corollary is proved.

Corollary 2.9. ld(L(Sn)) = n, where Sn is a star graph on n  2.

In [2], S. Arumugam et al. proved that complete bipartite graphs K2,n is local antimagic.

Theorem 2.10. [2] For any two distinct integers m, n  2, la(Km,n) = 2 if and only if m  n(mod2).

Theorem 2.11. [2] For any complete bipartite graph K2,n, we have

la(K2,n) =

2, for n is even and n  4 3, for n is odd or n = 2

We proved that any complete bipartite graphs Km,n, for m, n  2 are local distance antimagic is shown in Theorem 2.12.

Theorem 2.12. For any complete bipartite graph Km,n, we have ld(Km,n) = 2, for m, n  2.
Proof. Let V (Km,n) = {vi1  vj2, f or 1  i  m, 1  j  n} and E(Km,n) = {vi1 vj2, f or 1  i  m, 1  j  n}. Then |V (Km,n)| = m + n and |E(Km,n)| = mn. Let us define the bijective function f : V  {1, 2, 3, ..., m + n} by
f (vi1) = i, for 1  i  m f (vj2) = m + j, for 1  j  n
Then the vertex weights are
n
w(vi1) = m + j
j=1 m
w(vj2) = i
i=1
Thus ld(Km,n)  2. We know that, (Km,n) = 2. Therefore ld(Km,n) = 2.

10

Theorem 2.13. ld(Kx,y,z) = 3, where Kx,y,z, x, y, z  3 is a complete tripartite graph on n vertices and m edges.

Proof. Let V (Kx,y,z) = {vi1  vj2  vk3, f or 1  i  x, 1  j  y, 1  k  z} and E(Kx,y,z) = {vi1 vj2  vi1 vk3  vj2 vk3, f or 1  i  x, 1  j  y, 1  k  z}. Then |V (Kx,y,z)| = x + y + z and |E(Kx,y,z)| = x(y + z) + yz. Define f : V 
{1, 2, 3, ..., x + y + z} by

f (vi1) = i, for 1  i  x f (vj2) = x + j, for 1  j  y f (vk3) = y + k, for 1  k  z

Then the vertex weights are

w(vi1)

n(n + 2

x(x + 2

w(vj2)

Thus ld(Kx,y,z)  3. We know that, (Kx,y,z) = 3. Therefore ld(Kx,y,z) = 3.

In general, from Theorem 2.12 and 2.13, we observed that the local distance antimagic chromatic number of k-partite graph is k.
In [14], Martin Baca, Mirka Miller, Oudone Phanalasy, Andrea Semanicova´Fecnovc´ikova´ proved that regular-complete multipartite graphs are antimagic. Rinovia Simanjuntak, Kristiana Wijaya [16], proved all complete multipartite graphs are not distance antimagic. A complete multipartite graph is complete kpartite graphs. We proved that all complete multipartite graphs are local distance antimagic in Theorem 2.14.

Theorem 2.14. ld(Kp1,p2...pk) = k, where Kp1,p2...pk is a complete multipartite graph with |p1| = |p2| = ... = |pk| with k  4, n  2.
Proof. Let V (Kp1,p2...pk) = {vij, f or 1  i  n, 1  j  k}. Then |V (Kp1,p2...pk)| = np. Let us define the function f : V  {1, 2, 3, ..., np} by

f (vij) =

i, n(j - 1) + i,

for j = 1 for j  2

Then the vertex weight is given by

The chromatic number of the complete multipartite graph is equal to the
number of partitions in the graph. The set of vertices in each independent set receives a distinct color. Thus (Kp1,p2...pk) = k = ld(Kp1,p2...pk). Hence ld(Kp1,p2...pk ) = k.

Figure 3 shows the local distance antimagic chromatic number of the turan graph. It is a special case of the complete multipartite graph in which the size of two independent sets differs by at most one vertex. The chromatic number of Turan graph (Tn,k) = k, where k is the number of partitions and |V | = n. We have (T13,4) = 4 = ld(T13,4).

2.3 Local Distance Antimagic Chromatic Number of Graphs
Rinovia Simanjuntak, Kristiana Wijaya [16], investigated the distance antimagic labeling of friendship graphs. Nalliah. M [15] investigated the (a, 1)-distance antimagic labeling of friendship graph Fn for n = 1 or 2 and there is no (a, d)distance antimagic labeling of friendship graph if d  2. Handa. A.K, Aloysius Godinho, Singh. T [9] provided the distance antimagic labeling of ladder graphs. D. Froncek [5][6] proved the cartesian product of two disjoint copies of complete graphs and its complement are (a, 2)- distance antimagic and (a, 1)-distance an-

12

timagic respectively.
In this section, we prove that friendship graphs and ladder graphs are local distance antimagic. A friendship graph Fn, where |V | = p is the graph constructed by joining the n copies of cycle C3 to a common vertex.
Theorem 2.15. ld(Fn) = 2n + 1, for n  2. .
Proof. Let V (Fn) = {c  vi  ui, f or 1  i  n} and E(Fn) = {c vi  c ui  ui vi, f or 1  i  n}. We have |V (Fn)| = 2n + 1, |E(Fn)| = 3n. Define a bijective function f : V  {1, 2, 3, ..., 2n + 1} by
f (c) = 2n + 1 f (vi) = 2i - 1, for 1  i  n f (ui) = 2i, for 1  i  n
Then the vertex weights are
w(c) = n(2n + 1) w(vi) = 2n + 1 + 2i w(ui) = 2n + 2i
Thus ld(Fn)  2n + 1. Suppose f (c) = a, f (v1) = 1, f (u1) = 2. Then w(v1) = a + 2, w(u1) = a + 1 and w(c) = n(2n + 1). Thus vertex c receives the first color. Here vi and ui are adjacent vertices, if we need the minimum proper colors for the graph Fn, there is a only one possible that vi and ui, for 1  i  n receive two distinct colors. Therefore ld(Fn)  2n + 1. Hence ld(Fn) = 2n + 1.
Note that the join of two graphs K2 and K1 represents a friendship graph. Hence we proved the following Corollary.
Corollary 2.16. Let G = nK2 + K1, where n  3, then ld(G) = 2n + 1.
The cartesian product of two graphs G1 × G2 is the graph with vertex set V1 × V2 with two vertices u = (u1, u2)  V1 and v = (v1, v2)  V2 are adjacent if u1 = v1 and u2 is adjacent to v2 or u2 = v2 and u1 is adjacent to v1. A Ladder graph Ln is obtained by the cartesian product of two graphs P2 and Pn.
Theorem 2.17. ld(Ln)  2(n - 1), for n  3.
Proof. Let V (Ln) = {vi, ui, f or 1  i  2n} with |V (Ln)| = 2n. Define a bijective function f : V  {1, 2, 3, ..., 2n} by
f (vi) = i, for 1  i  n f (ui) = 2n + 1 - i, for 1  i  n
13

Then the vertex weights are

 2(n + 1),  w(vi) = 2n + 1 + i,
2n,

for i = 1 for 2  i  n - 1 for i = n

2n,  w(ui) = 4n + 2 - i,
2(n + 1),

for i = 1 for 2  i  n - 1 for i = n

Hence ld(Ln)  2(n - 1).

2.4 Corona Product of Graph G with Null Graph Km
In this section we compute the local distance antimagic vertex coloring for corona product of graph G with the null graph Km on m  1, where G is a star Sn, a complete Kn, and a friendship graph Fn.
Theorem 2.18. ld(Sn  Km) = n + 2, for n  3, m = 1.
Proof. Let V (Sn  K1) = {c  vi  vi1  c1, f or 1  i  n} and E(Sn  K1) = {cvi  vivi1  cc1, f or 1  i  n}. Then |V (Sn  K1)| = 2n + 2 and |E(Sn  K1)| = 2n + 1. Define a bijective function f : V - {1, 2, ..., 2n + 2} by

f (vi) =

2n + 1, n + i,

for i = 1 for 2  i  n

f (vi1) =i, for 1  i  n f (c) =n + 1

f (c1) =2n + 2

Then the weight of the vertices are

w(vi) =n + 1 + i, for 1  i  n

w(vi1) =f (vi)

w(c)

w(c1) =f (c)

Thus ld(Sn  K1)  n + 2.

Theorem 2.19. ld(Sn  Km) = n + 3, for every n  3 and m  2.
Proof. Let V (Sn Km) = {cvi vij cj , 1  i  n, 1  j  m} and E(Sn Km) = {cvi  vivij  ccj, 1  i  n, 1  j  m}. Then |V (Sn  Km)| = (n + 1)(m + 1) and |E(Sn  Km)| = n(m + 1) + m. Now, define the function f : V - {1, 2, ..., (n + 1)(m + 1)} by Case 1: when m  2, is even

f (c) =(m + 1)n + 1

f (cj) =(m + 1)n + 1 + j, for 1  j  m

f (vi) =mn + i, for 1  i  n

f (vij) =

n(j - 1) + i, nj + 1 - i,

j is odd, 1  i  n, 1  j  m j is even, 1  i  n, 1  j  m

Thus ld(Sn Km)  n+3, where m  2. We know that chromatic number (Sn 

Km) = 2. In the local distance antimagic labeling, the weight of the pendant

vertex is the label of its adjacent vertex. The graph Sn  Km has n-different sets

of the pendant vertices. Therefore the graph receives n + 1 colors. Then the

minimum

possible

weight

of

the

central

vertex

is

(n+m)(n+m+1) 2

.

Therefore

w(c)

>

|V (G)|, the central vertex receives n + 2 color. Also the minimum vertex weight

of

vi,

w(vi)

=

f (vivij)+f (c)

=

(nm+1)(nm+2) 2n

.

w(vi)

>

|V (G)|

and

w(vi)

is

adjacent

to w(c). Therefore w(vi) need a new color. Hence the graph ld(Sn Km)  n+3.

Therefore ld(Sn  Km) = n + 3.

Theorem 2.20. ld(Kn  Km) = 2n, for n  3, m  1.

Proof. Consider a graph Kn  Km denotes the corona product of complete graph

Kn, for n  3 vertices and the complement of Km, for m  1. Let V (Kn  Km) =

{vivij, f or 1  i  n, 1  j  m} and E(KnKm) = {vivi+1vivnvivij, f or 1 

i  n, 1  j  m}. Then |V (Kn  Km)| = n(m + 1) and |E(Kn  Km)| =

Define

a bijective

function f

f (vij) =n(j + 1) - i + 1, for 1  i  n, 1  j  m f (vi) =i, for 1  i  n, 1  j  m.

The weight of the vertices are

w(vij) =i, for 1  i  n, 1  j  m

w(vi)

= n(n

m
[n(j + 1) - i + 1], for 1  i  n, 1  j  m

Thus ld(Kn  Km)  2n. Suppose m  1 and n = 3, the minimum possible

weight

of

the

vertex

w(vi)

=

(m+n)(m+n-1) 2

=

|V (G)|.

Then

the

minimum

possible

weight of the vertex v1, w(v1) = f (v2) + f (v3) + f (v11) = 6. In this case v2 and

v3 receives the label 1 and 2 respectively. If w(v1) = w(v21) or w(v31), then the

minimum possibility of the vertex weights are wv21) and w(v31) is not equal to 6.

Similar argument is applied for v21) and w(v31). Thus ld(K3  K1) = 2n. For

n  3, m  2, the minimum possible weight w(vi) > |V (Kn  Km)|. Thus vi, for

1  i  n receives n distinct colors. It is obvious that weight of all the pendant

vertex receives the label of its adjacent vertex. Then the graph has n different

set of colors. Therefore ld(Kn  Km) = 2n.

Theorem 2.21. ld(Fn  Km) = 2n + 4, for n  2, m  1. Proof. Let V (Fn  Km) = {c  vi  ui  vij  uji  cj, 1  i  n, 1  j  m} and E(Fn  Km) = {cvi  cui  viui  vivij  uiuji  ccj, 1  i  n, 1  j  m}. Then

16

|V (Fn  Km)| = (m + 1)(2n + 1) and |E(Fn  Km)| = m(2n + 1) + 3n. Define a bijective function f : V - {1, 2, ..., (m + 1)(2n + 1)} by

f (vi) =2i - 1, for 1  i  n f (ui) =2i, for 1  i  n f (c) =2n + 1
Case 1: m = 1
f (vi1) =4n + 3 - 2i, for 1  i  n f (u1i ) =4n + 2 - 2i, for 1  i  n f (c1) =4n + 2
The vertex weights are
w(vi) =6n + 4 w(ui) =6n + 2 w(c) =2n2 + 5n + 2
Case 2: When m = 2

f (vij) =

5n + 2 - i, 6n + 2 - i,

for 1  i  n, j = 1 for 1  i  n, j = 2

f (uji ) =

3n + 2 - i, 4n + 2 - i,

for 1  i  n, j = 1 for 1  i  n, j = 2

The vertex weights are

w(vi) =13n + 5 w(ui) =9n + 4 w(c) =2n2 + 13n + 5

Case 3: When m  3, is odd

f (vij) =

n(j + m + 1) + i + 1, n(j + m + 2) - i + 2,

j is even, 2  j  m - 1 j is odd, 3  j  m

f (uji ) =

n(j + 2) + i + 1, 4n + 2 - i,

j is even, 2  j  m - 1 j is odd, 3  j  m

f (cj) =2n(m + 1) + j + 1, 1  j  m

Thus, ld(FnKm)  2n+4. We know that chromatic number (FnKm) = 3. In the local distance antimagic labeling, the weight of the pendant vertex is the

label of its adjacent vertex. The graph Fn  Km has 2n-different sets of the

pendant vertices. Therefore the graph receives 2n + 1 colors. Then the minimum

possible

weight

of

the

central

vertex

is

(2n+m)(2n+m+1) 2

.

Therefore

w(c)

>

|V (G)|,

the central vertex receives 2n + 2 color. Also the minimum vertex weight of vi,

w(vi)

=

f (ui) + f (vij) + f (c)

=

(nm+2)(nm+3) 2n

,

so

w(vi)

>

|V (G)|.

Therefore

w(vi)

receives an another new color 2n + 3. Similar argument occurs for vertex ui.

Thus ui receives a new color 2n + 4. Hence ld(Fn  Km)  2n + 4. Therefore

ld(Fn  Km) = 2n + 4.

3 Conclusion and Scope
In this paper, we proved that some star-related graphs, complete graphs, complete k-partite graphs, friendship graphs, ladder graphs and some corona product
18

of graphs are local distance antimagic and hence computed ld(G). In general, we observe that ld(G) = (G) for star graphs, line graph of star graphs, complete graphs, complete k-partite graphs, complete multipartite graphs. Further, ld(G) > (G) for subdivision of star graphs, bistar graphs, subdivision of bistars, shadow graph of bistars, doublestar graphs, friendship graphs, ladder graphs and corona product of graphs. It is clear that proved that, ld(G)  (G). Thus, we obtained ld(G)  (G) and obviously ld(G) = n for complete graph Kn. Hence the following problems arise naturally.
Problem 3.1. Characterise the class of graphs for which ld(G) = n.
There are several classes of graphs such as Kn, Sn, L(Sn), Km,n, Kx,y,z and Kp1,p2,...pk for which ld(G) = (G). Hence we arrive the following problem.
Problem 3.2. Characterise the class of graphs for which ld(G) = (G).
Problem 3.3. Characterise graphs with ld(G  Km) = 2n.
In Theorem 2.17, we have determined the local distance chromatic number of the ladder graph ld(Ln)  2(n - 1). The problem is open for the remaining case.
