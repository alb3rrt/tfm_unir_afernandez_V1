S~I TIE^. P D- INH AND TIE^´N-SO.N PHA. M
Abstract. In this paper, we give a characterization of openness of definable non-smooth mappings. More precisely, for a definable continuous mapping f from a definable connected open subset  of Rn into Rn, we will show that the following two statements are equivalent:
(i) The mapping f is open. (ii) The fibers of f are finite and the Jacobian of f does not change sign on the set of
points at which f is differentiable.
1. Introduction
We are interested in the possible necessary and sufficient conditions for a continuous mapping to be open. Recall that a mapping is open if it maps open sets onto open sets.
By Remmert's open mapping theorem (see, for example, [14, Theorem 2, p. 297] or [16, Proposition 4, p. 132]), we know that a holomorphic mapping f : Cn  Cn is open if and only if its fibers are discrete.
For a real polynomial mapping f : Rn  Rn, Gamboa and Ronga [6] proved that f is open if and only if the fibers of f are finite and the Jacobian (i.e., the determinant of the Jacobian matrix) of f does not change sign. After that, Hirsch [10] affirmed that the Jacobian of a real analytic open mapping f : Rn  Rn does not change sign. Recently in [4, Theorem 3.14], Denkowski and Loeb showed that a subanalytic (or definable in some o-minimal structure) mapping f of class C1 is open if and only if the fibers of f are finite and the Jacobian of f does not change sign.
In the non-smooth setting, a result of Scholtes [20, Proposition 2.3.7, Theorem 2.3.1] stated that a piecewise affine mapping is open if and only if it is coherently oriented. See also [1, 7, 12, 15, 17, 24] for related works.
We present here a definable non-smooth version of the above results. Namely, let f :   Rn be a definable continuous mapping, where  is a definable connected open set in Rn. Denote by Df the set of points in  at which f is differentiable; this set is dense in  (see, e.g., [2, 22]). Then the following two statements are equivalent:

(i) The mapping f is open. (ii) The fibers of f are finite and the Jacobian of f does not change sign on the set Df .
The idea of the proof of this equivalence is similar to those in [4, 6, 10]. However, some details need to be taken into account in the non-smooth case.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains some properties of definable sets and mappings in o-minimal structures. For the convenience of the reader, the classical invariance of domain theorem and some properties of the Brouwer degree are also recalled here. The main result and its proof are given in Section 3.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Notation and definitions. We suppose 1  n  N and abbreviate (x1, . . . , xn) by x. The space Rn is equipped with the usual scalar product ·, · and the corresponding

Euclidean norm · . If x  Rn and   Rn is a non-empty set then the distance from x

to  is defined by dist(x, ) := infy x - y . The closure and boundary of a set   Rn will be written as  and , respectively.

Let f be a mapping from an open set  in Rn into Rn. Then f is an open mapping

if f (U) is an open subset of Rn whenever U is an open subset of ; f has finite fibers if

for each y  Rn, the fiber f -1(y) is a finite (possibly empty) set. Let Df denote the set

of points in  at which f is differentiable. If x  Df then we denote the Jacobian matrix

of f at x by df (x) =

fi xj

(x)

, and the determinant of df (x) is the Jacobian of f

at x,

denoted by Jf (x). Let Rf denote the set of points x   such that f is of class C1 in a

neighborhood of x and the Jacobian Jf (x) is nonzero. Observe that Rf is an open set but it is not necessarily connected.

2.2. The invariance of domain theorem and the Brouwer degree. For the convenience of the reader, we recall here the classical invariance of domain theorem and some properties of the Brouwer degree.
Lemma 2.1 (Invariance of domain). Let  be an open subset of Rn. Then every injective continuous mapping from  into Rn is open.
Proof. See, for example, [5, Chapter 4, Proposition 7.4].
Suppose  is an open and bounded set in Rn, f :   Rn is a continuous mapping, and y  f (). The Brouwer degree of f on  with respect to y, denoted by deg(f, , y), is a function of integer values which enjoys several important properties (normalization, domain decomposition, local constancy, homotopy invariance, etc.). The Brouwer degree is a power tool used in analysis and topology, in particular, it gives an estimation and the

2

nature of the solution(s) of the equation f (x) = y in . For more details, the reader may refer to [3, 13] and the references therein.
The two lemmas below provide some useful properties of the Brouwer degree.

Lemma 2.2. Let  be an open and bounded set in Rn, f :   Rn be a continuous mapping, and y  f (). Then the following statements hold:
(i) If deg(f, , y) = 0, then there is x   such that f (x) = y. (ii) For all y  Rn with y - y < dist(y, f ()) we have
deg(f, , y) = deg(f, , y).
(iii) If H :  × [0, 1]  Rn is continuous,  : [0, 1]  Rn is continuous, and (t)  H(, t) for every t  [0, 1], then deg(H(·, t), , (t)) is independent of t  [0, 1].

Proof. See, for example, [3, 13].

Lemma 2.3. Let  be an open and bounded set in Rn and f :   Rn be a continuous mapping. Then the following statements hold:
(i) Let x   be such that the Jacobian matrix df (x) exists and is nonsingular. Then there exists a neighborhood W of x such that W  f -1(f (x)) = {x} and
deg(f, W, f (x)) = signJf (x).
(ii) Let y  f () be such that for every x  f -1(y), the Jacobian matrix df (x) exists and is nonsingular. Then

deg(f, , y) =

signJf (x).

xf -1(y)

Proof. See [3, 13] for the smooth case and see [8, 19, 21] for the non-smooth case.

2.3. O-minimal structures and definable mappings. The notion of o-minimality was developed in the late 1980s after it was noticed that many proofs of analytic and geometric properties of semi-algebraic sets and mappings can be carried over verbatim for subanalytic sets and mappings. We refer the reader to [2, 22, 23] for the basic properties of o-minimal structures used in this paper.

Definition 2.1. An o-minimal structure on (R, +, ·) is a sequence D := (Dn)nN such that for each n  N:
(a) Dn is a Boolean algebra of subsets of Rn. (b) If X  Dm and Y  Dn, then X × Y  Dm+n. (c) If X  Dn+1, then (X)  Dn, where  : Rn+1  Rn is the projection on the first
n coordinates.

3

(d) Dn contains all algebraic subsets of Rn. (e) Each set belonging to D1 is a finite union of points and intervals.
A set belonging to D is said to be definable (in that structure). Definable mappings in structure D are mappings whose graphs are definable sets in D.
Examples of o-minimal structures are · the semi-algebraic sets (by the Tarski­Seidenberg theorem), · the globally subanalytic sets, i.e., the subanalytic sets of Rn whose (compact)
closures in the real projective space RPn are subanalytic (using Gabrielov's complement theorem). In this note, we fix an arbitrary o-minimal structure on (R, +, ·). The term "definable" means definable in this structure. We recall some useful facts which we shall need later.
Lemma 2.4 (Monotonicity). Let f : (a, b)  R be a definable function and p be a positive integer. Then there are finitely many points a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tk = b such that the restriction of f to each interval (ti, ti+1) is of class Cp, and either constant or strictly monotone.
Lemma 2.5 (Path connectedness). The following statements hold: (i) Every definable set has a finite number of connected components and each such component is definable. (ii) Every definable connected set X is path connected, i.e., for every points x, y in X, there exists a definable continuous curve  : [0, 1]  X such that (0) = x and (1) = y.
By the cell decomposition theorem (see, for example [23, 4.2]), for any p  N and any nonempty definable subset X of Rn, we can write X as a disjoint union of finitely many definable Cp-manifolds of different dimensions. The dimension dim X of a nonempty definable set X can thus be defined as the dimension of the manifold of highest dimension of such a decomposition. This dimension is well defined and independent on the decomposition of X. By convention, the dimension of the empty set is taken to be negative infinity. A point x  X is generic if there exists a neighborhood U of x in Rn such that X  U is a definable C1-manifold of dimension dim X.
Lemma 2.6. Let X  Rn be a nonempty definable set. Then the following statements hold:
(i) If X has measure zero then dim X < n. (ii) The interior of X is nonempty if and only if dim X = n. (iii) dim(X \ X) < dim X. In particular, dim X = dim X.
4

(iv) Let Y  Rn be a definable set containing X. If X is dense in Y then dim(Y \ X) < dim Y.
(v) If Y  Rn is definable, then dim(X  Y ) = max{dim X, dim Y }. (vi) Let f : X  Rm be a definable mapping. Then dim f (X)  dim X. (vii) The complement in X of the set of generic points in X is a definable set of dimension
less than dim X.
Lemma 2.7. Let X  Rn be a definable open set and f : X  Rm be a definable mapping. Then for each positive integer p, the set of points where f is not of class Cp is a definable set of dimension less than n.
In the sequel we will make use of Hardt's triviality (see [9, 22]).
Theorem 2.1 (Hardt's triviality). Consider a definable continuous mapping f : X  Y where X  Rn and Y  Rm are definable sets. Then there exists a finite partition Y = Y1  · · ·  Yk of Y into definable sets Yi such that f is definably trivial over each Yi, that is, there exists a definable set Fi  Rni, for some ni, and a definable homeomorphism hi : f -1(Yi)  Yi×Fi such that the composition hi with the projection Yi×Fi  Yi, (y, z)  y, is equal to the restriction of f to f -1(Yi).
3. The main result and its proof
The main result of this paper on necessary and sufficient conditions for openness reads as follows.
Theorem 3.1. Let f :   Rn be a definable continuous mapping, where  is a definable connected open set in Rn. Then the following two conditions are equivalent:
(i) The mapping f is open. (ii) The fibers of f are finite and the Jacobian Jf does not change sign on the set Df of
points at which f is differentiable.
In order to prove Theorem 3.1, we need some lemmas. The first one is [18, Fact 2.2], which is a direct consequence of [11, Proposition 2].
Lemma 3.1. Let  be a definable connected open subset of Rn and R be a definable open dense subset of . Consider the graph  whose vertices are the connected components of R with two components Ri and Rj connected by an edge if and only if dim(RiRj) n-1. Then  is connected.
The proof of the following lemma is contained in [18, Lemma 3.1].
5

Lemma 3.2. Let W  Rn-1 and U  Rn be definable open sets such that the set W := W × {0} is contained in the boundary of U. Let f : U  W  R be a definable function continuous on U  W and C1 on U. Let g : W  R be the function y  f (y, 0) and a  W be a generic point. Then g is differentiable at a and, for all i = 1, . . . , n - 1,

g (a) = lim f (x).

x(a,0), xU xi

The following fact is simple but useful.

Lemma 3.3. Let  be a definable open set in Rn and f :   Rn be a definable continuous mapping. Assume that the fibers of f are finite. Then the following two statements hold:
(i) If X is a definable subset of , then dim X = dim f (X). (ii) The set Rf is dense in .

Proof. (i) Let X be a definable subset of . Applying Hardt's Trivial Theorem 2.1 to the restriction mapping f |X of f to X, we obtain a finite definable partition of f (X) onto Y1, . . . , Yk such that f |X is definably trivial over each Yi. Since the fibers of f are finite, it follows that
dim(f |X)-1(Yi) = dim Yi for i = 1, . . . , k.

Hence

dim X

=

max
i=1,...,k

dim(f

|X

)-1(Yi)

=

max
i=1,...,k

dim

Yi

=

dim f (X),

which yields (i).

(ii) Let B be the set of points x   such that f is not C1 in a neighborhood of x.

Then B is closed in . Further, in view of Lemma 2.7, B is a definable set of dimension

less than n. Consider the definable set

C := {x   \ B : Jf (x) = 0}.

Applying Sard's theorem to the C1-mapping  \ B  Rn, x  f (x),

we have that f (C) has measure zero, and so it has dimension less than n in view of Lemma 2.6(i). This, together with the statement (i), implies that

dim C = dim f (C) < n.

Consequently, dim(B  C) < n. Now (ii) follows immediately since Rf =  \ (B  C). This ends the proof of the lemma.

We are now in position to prove Theorem 3.1.

6

Proof of Theorem 3.1. (cf. [4, Theorem 3.14], [18, Theorem 3.2]).

Sufficiency. To see that f is open, take any x   and let W be a neighborhood of x. Since the fiber f -1(f (x)) is finite, there exists an open ball U centered at x with U  W such that U  f -1(f (x)) = {x}. Since U is compact and f (x)  f (U), we can find an open ball V  Rn centered at f (x) such that f (U)  V = . Now the conclusion follows if we can show that f (U)  V.
In view of Lemma 3.3(ii), the set Rf is dense in . Since U is an open subset of , there exists a point u in U  Rf . Then f is of class C1 on a neighborhood of u and the Jacobian matrix of f at u is nonsingular. By the inverse mapping theorem, the image f (U) must contain an open set Y  V. On the other hand, it follows from Lemmas 3.3 and 2.6(iv) that

dim f (U \ Rf ) = dim(U \ Rf ) < n.
So there must exist some point y in Y  f (Rf ). Therefore, U  f -1(y) is nonempty and for every x  U f -1(y), the Jacobian matrix df (x) exists and is nonsingular. Furthermore, by construction, y is not in f (U). For simplicity of notation, we let g stand for the restriction of f to U . Then the Brouwer degree deg(g, U, y) is defined. In light of Lemma 2.3(ii), we have

deg(g, U, y) =

signJ g(x).

xg-1(y)

On the other hand, by assumption, the Jacobian Jf is positive (or negative) on Rf , and so

signJg(x) = 0.
xg-1(y)
Therefore deg(g, U, y) = 0. Finally, to prove that V  f (U), take any y  V and consider the continuous curve

 : [0, 1]  V, t  (1 - t)y + ty,

connecting y to y. Since f (U)  V = , we have (t)  g(U) for all t  [0, 1]. This, together with Lemma 2.2(iii), implies that

deg(g, U, y) = deg(g, U, y) = 0.

By Lemma 2.2(i), g(x) = y for some x in U, and this completes the proof of the sufficiency.

Necessity. Assume that f is open. If n = 1, then f is strictly monotone and there is nothing to prove. So for the rest of the proof we assume that n > 1.
By [4, Theorem 3.10] (see also [6, Proposition, page 298]), the fibers of f are finite.

We first show that the Jacobian Jf has constant sign on Rf which means that Jf is positive (or negative) on Rf . Recall that Rf stands for the set of points x   such that f is of class C1 on a neighborhood of x and the Jacobian Jf (x) is nonzero.
Obviously, the set Rf is definable open, and according to Lemma 3.3(ii), it is dense in . By Lemma 2.5, Rf has a finite number of connected components, say R1, . . . , Rk, and these components are path connected. By definition, Jf has constant sign on each Ri. According to Lemma 3.1, we need to show that for any two components Ri, Rj with dim(  Ri  Rj) n - 1, the sign of Jf on Ri is the same as on Rj. We consider two such components Ri, Rj and assume that they are R1 and R2. Let  :=   R1  R2. In view of Lemma 2.6(iii), it is easy to see that dim  = n - 1.
Let x be a generic point in ; then  is a C1-submanifold of Rn of dimension n-1 near x. Hence, there is a definable connected open neighborhood U   of x and a definable diffeomorphism  from U onto an open subset of Rn such that (U  )  {xn = 0}. Shrinking U and composing  with the reflection with respect to the hyperplane {xn = 0} if necessary, we may assume that (U  R1)  {xn > 0} and (U  R2)  {xn < 0}.
Since  is a diffeomorphism and U is connected, the sign of J is constant on U. Furthermore f  -1 is open on (U). Hence we may replace  by (U), f by f  -1 and assume that
R1  {xn > 0}, R2  {xn < 0} and   {xn = 0}.
On the other hand, since the fibers of f are finite, it follows from Lemma 3.3(i) that
dim f () = dim  = n - 1.
Let y be a generic point in f (); then f () is a C1-submanifold of Rn of dimension n - 1 near y. As before, by applying an appropriate definable diffeomorphism on an open neighborhood of y we may assume that f ()  {yn = 0}. Applying Hardt's Trivial Theorem 2.1 to the restriction of f to f -1(f ()), we obtain a finite definable partition of f () onto Y1, . . . , Yk such that this restriction mapping is definably trivial over each Yi. By Lemma 2.5, f -1(Yi) has a finite number of connected components and each such component is homeomorphic to Yi because f has finite fibers. Observe that there exists an index i such that the set f -1(Yi)   is of dimension n - 1. Let  be a connected component of f -1(Yi)   of dimension n - 1. Now, by shrinking  we may assume that   f -1(f ()) = .
By construction, it is easy to see that each of the (connected open) sets f (R1) and f (R2) is contained in either {yn > 0} or {yn < 0} but not in both. Furthermore, since f is open, the sets f (R1) and f (R2) cannot lie in the same half-space {yn > 0} or {yn < 0}.
8

Hence, without lost of generality, we may assume that

f (R1)  {yn > 0} and f (R2)  {yn < 0}.

Write f := (f1, . . . , fn) and let (a, 0)  Rn-1 × 0 be a generic point in . Observe that

fn(a, -t) < fn(a, 0) = 0 < fn(a, t)

for all t > 0 sufficiently small. By Lemma 2.4, it is easy to see that fn(a, t) is strictly

increasing

Consequently,

for all t  (-, ) different from 0. Since (a, 0) is generic in , we may assume, by shrinking

If

this

last

change of  makes the point (a, 0) not generic in , we replace (a, 0) by another generic

point and continue to assume that (a, 0) is generic in .

Define the definable continuous mapping  :   Rn by

(x1, . . . , xn) := (x1, . . . , xn-1, fn(x1, . . . , xn)).

Obviously,  is identity on  and differentiable on  \ . Furthermore,  is injective since

for every (x1, . . . , xn-1, 0)  , the function xn  fn(x1, . . . , xn) is strictly increasing. In

light of Lemma 2.1,  is a homeomorphism from  onto (). Observe that J(x) =

fn xn

(x)

for

all

x

hence

J

is

.

Consequently,

we

can

replace

the mapping f by the mapping f  -1 without changing the sign of the Jacobian of f

on  \ . Without loss of generality, assume from now on that fn(x1, . . . , xn) = xn on . For x = (x1, . . . , xn)   \  we have

Jf (x) =

As f is open, the restriction of f to f -1(Rn-1 × {0}) is an open mapping from f -1(Rn-1 × {0}) into Rn-1 × {0}. Hence the mapping

g : W  Rn-1, x  (f1(x, 0), . . . , fn-1(x, 0)),

is definable, open and continuous, where W := {x  Rn-1 : (x, 0)  } is a definable open subset of Rn-1. By [4, Theorem 3.10] (see also [6, Proposition, page 298]), the fibers

of g are finite. Applying Lemma 3.3(ii) to the mapping g, we have that the set Rg is dense in W. Thus, replacing a by a point in Rg if necessary, we may assume that Jg(a) = 0.
By Lemma 3.2, for 1 i, j n - 1, we have

lim fi (x) = gi (a).

x(a,0), x xj

xj

9

It follows then from (1) that

lim Jf (x) = Jg(a).
x(a,0), x
Hence, for x   close enough to (a, 0), whether in R1 or in R2, the sign of Jf (x) is the same as the sign of Jg(a). In particular, the sign of Jf is the same in R1 and in R2.
We have thus proved that the Jacobian Jf has constant sign on Rf . So, without loss of generality, we may assume that the Jacobian Jf is positive on Rf . It remains to show that
Jf (x) 0 for all x  Df .
To see this, let x  Df be such that Jf (x) = 0. In view of Lemma 2.3(i), there exists a definable open and bounded neighborhood W of x such that W  f -1(f (x)) = {x} and

deg(f, W, f (x)) = signJf (x).

(2)

On the other hand, by Lemma 3.3, the set f (Rf ) is dense in f (). Note that f (W ) is an open subset of f () because the mapping f is open. Consequently, there exists a point y  f (W ) with y - f (x) < dist(f (x), f (W )) such that f -1(y)  Rf . In particular, for every w  f -1(y), the Jacobian matrix df (w) exists and is nonsingular. It follows from Lemmas 2.2(ii) and 2.3(ii) that

deg(f, W, f (x)) = deg(f, W, y) =

signJf (w) > 0.

(3)

wf -1(y)

Combining (2) and (3), we get Jf (x) > 0, which completes the proof of the theorem.
