## Abstract

In this work we study the Humbert-Edge's curves of type 5, defined as a complete intersection of four diagonal quadrics in $\mathbb{P}^5$. We characterize them using Kummer surfaces and using the geometry of these surfaces we construct some vanishing thetanulls on such curves. In addition, we describe an argument to give an isomorphism between the moduli space of Humbert-Edge's curves of type 5 and the moduli space of hyperelliptic curves of genus 2, and we let see how this argument can be generalized to state an isomorphism between the moduli space of hyperelliptic curves of genus $g=\frac{n-1}{2}$ and the moduli space of Humbert-Edge's curves of type $n\geq 5$ where $n$ is an odd number.
