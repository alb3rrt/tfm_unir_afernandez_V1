Ehrenfest urns with interaction that are connected in a ring is considered as a paradigm model for non-equilibrium thermodynamics and is shown to exhibit two distinct non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) of uniform and non-uniform particle distributions. As the inter-particle attraction varies, a first order non-equilibrium phase transition occurs between these two NESSs characterized by a coexistence regime. The phase boundaries, the NESS particle distributions near saddle points and the associated particle fluxes, average urn population fractions, and the relaxational dynamics to the NESSs are obtained analytically and verified numerically. A generalized non-equilibrium thermodynamics law is also obtained, which explicitly identifies the heat, work, energy and entropy of the system.

I. INTRODUCTION
The classic Ehrenfest model [1] was introduced to solve the reversal and Poincare recurrence paradox [2, 3]. It describes a total of N particles in two urns that can randomly jump from one urn to the other with equal probability. The system has a Poincare cycle time of 2N [4], providing a fundamental link between reversible microscopic dynamics and irreversible thermodynamics.
Later on, a directional jumping rate between urns was introduced [5, 6], and extensions to multi-urns [7­9] were made. Although there are various modifications [10­ 21] of the classic Ehrenfest model, or even extensions by incorporating non-linear contribution [22­25], particles do not interact or the interaction is merely phenomenological. In fact, pairwise particle interaction in the same urn has been considered recently in the twourn model [26]. The interacting two-urn Ehrenfest model can exhibit phase transitions by varying the interaction strength and directional jumping rate from which the relaxation time and Poincar´e cycle can be derived. The multi-urn system with interaction and unbiased directional jumping will evolve to equilibrium and has been shown to exhibit different levels of non-uniformity emerge with the coexistence of uniform and non-uniform phases [27]. Contrary to the better understood equilibrium cases, non-equilibrium statistical physics remains challenging, partly due to the lack of well-characterised states. Even for non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), it is difficult to describe non-equilibrium phase transitions between different NESS and their relationship to some microscopic models. For example, selection rules, such as maximal or minimal entropy production principles [28­ 30] have been proposed to determine the non-equilibrium states. Yet, universal guiding principles are still lacking.
In this manuscript, we consider urns with intra-urn interactions connected in a one-dimensional ring with di-

rectional jumping rates. We will show that the system has non-equilibrium steady states in uniform and nonuniform phases that can coexist. For high directional jumping rates with appropriate interaction strengths, the steady states become unstable. The phase diagram will be obtained analytically, and the relaxation dynamics to the NESS will be studied. The relationship between nonequilibrium thermodynamical variables, such as the internal entropy production rate, the rate of work done applied to the system, will be shown to obey a generalized thermodynamic law. Finally, we will demonstrate that, in the coexistence region, the internal entropy production rate fails to select the favorable steady state.

II. EHRENFEST URNS IN A RING

We consider three urns as illustrated in Fig.1 as this already captures the non-equilibrium physics. The state of the system is labeled by n = (n1, n2, n3) where ni is the number of particles in the i-th urn with n1 +n2 +n3 = N , the fixed total particle number. Similar to previous models [26, 27], we include a pairwise attractive (repulsive) interaction with negative (positive) energy J for particles in the same urn. Particles in different urns do not interact. A particle in the i-th urn (initial state n) jumps to the j-th urn (final state m) with corresponding transition probability

where mi = ni - 1 and mj = nj + 1. g  N J where

tion (g = 0), we have Tm,n =

.

Next, a jumping rate

is introduced such that the probability of anticlockwise

(clockwise) direction is p (q). For the sake of convenience,

p+q = 1 is imposed for which only changes the time scale.

which can be verified by direct substitution. Results for

the general case of M urns at equilibrium can be found

in Ref.[27]. For the three urns case here with the con-

straint n1 + n2 + n3 = N , one can define the popula-

tion fraction with xi  ni/N and rewrite ss in terms

of x  (x1, x2) (two independent variables), ss(x) =

After s steps from the initial state, the probability of the state n is denoted by (n, s). The master equation from the s-th to the (s + 1)-th time step can be written as

(n, s + 1) - (n, s) = (Wn,m(m, s) - Wm,n(n, s))(2)

(4)

if (i, j) = (2, 1), (1, 3), (3, 2), which represents clockwise jumps.
Finally, the net particle flow rate from the i-th to the j-th urn (see Fig.1 for illustration) is given by

Kij (s)  N (Wm,n - Wm,n)(n, s)

where mi = ni - 1, mj = nj + 1, and mi = ni + 1, mj = nj - 1.

where xsp is the saddle point(s) satisfying 1f = 2f = 0, 11f < 0, and 11f 22f - (12f )2 > 0. This condition
leads to

xs1pegxs1p = xs2pegxs2p = xs3pegxs3p

(10)

The solutions at different coupling constant g are shown in the data of p = 0.5 in Fig.2(a). The steady net particle flow at equilibrium from Eq.(5) reads

Kiss j N

=

xsipegxsip - xsjpegxsjp 2(egxsip + egxsjp )

+ O(1/N )

(11)

which gives K1ss2 = K2ss3 = K3ss1 = 0 from Eq.(10), in large N limit. At equilibrium, there is no net particle

flow between any two urns. In addition, it is also easy to

see

from

Eqs.(5)

and

that

equilibrium case of p = q, there can be non-vanishing

circulating fluxes as in other general NESS systems [32­

34].

III. EQUILIBRIUM STATES

If lims (n, s) exists, it defines the steady state

ss(n). Taking the limit s   in Eq.(2) would lead

to an equation in which ss(n) satisfies. No closed form

exists in general.

But for the case of p = q =

an

analytic expression for ss can be obtained

IV. UNIFORM AND NON-UNIFORM NON-EQUILIBRIUM STEADY STATES

So far, the recurrence relation in Eq.(2) cannot be

solved analytically even for NESS. In this section, we

will transform Eq.(2) into the Fokker-Planck equation.

Let

by

Eq.(2) can be rewritten as

The WKB approximation [37­41] yields the saddle points [31] xsp = (xs1p, xs2p) as

A1(xsp) = 0, A2(xsp) = 0

(20)

whose solutions at different g and p are shown in Fig.2. The physical meaning of Eq.(20) is that K1ss2 = K2ss3 = K3ss1 = Kss, i.e., a constant non-zero cyclic flux of net particle along the ring which can be calculated from
Eq.(5) as

and,

puted using the non-uniform saddle point from Eqs.(20).

The Kuss and Knssu NESS fluxes as a function of g at different p are shown in Fig.3 indicating that the particle

flux of the uniform NESS is always significantly larger

than that of the non-uniform NESS. Notice that there is

a coexistence region of uniform and non-uniform saddle

points.

The NESS can be further analysed by expanding around the saddle point, i.e. using Ai(x) 
j j Ai(xsp)(xj - xsjp)  j aij (xj - xsjp) and Bij (x)  Bij(xsp) = bij, the steady state particle distribution is

formed into c = b-1a (See Appendix B for details).

bution) if they are strongly attractive (negatively large g). In between, for low jumping rate, 1 - ps < p < ps (ps  0.6823), there is a coexistence region where both uniform and non-uniform distribution are locally stable. There is a first order non-equilibrium phase transition between the uniform and non-uniform NESSs whose transition value of g can be determined from the analytic result of Kuss and Knssu (see Appendix C for details) together with the results of mean steady state flux. The latter has to be determined numerically using (2) . The first order phase transition line (dashed-dotted curve) is also shown in Fig.4. It is close to the stability line of the non-uniform NESS (for magnification, see Fig.12 in Appendix C). As the jumping rate becomes higher, i.e. p > ps (or p < 1 - ps), the system is far from equilibrium and steady states do no longer exist.

FIG. 4: Phase diagram of the interacting Ehrenfest model of three urns connected in a ring. There are four regions which represent uniform NESS (particles uniformly distributed in three urns), non-uniform NESS, coexistence (both uniform and non-uniform NESSs are stable), and no steady state. The stability boundaries of the uniform NESS and non-uniform NESS are denoted by the vertical dashed line and solid curve respectively. The first order phase transition boundary in the coexistence regime is denoted by the dashed-dotted curve (see Fig.12 in Appendix C for a magnification).

Hence its stability requires g > -3. The stable region for the non-uniform phase can be determined analytically in a similar manner and the results agree with the analytic ones of the phase boundary in Fig.4. In fact, the non-equilibrium physics of the system can be summarized by the phase diagram in Fig.4 whose phase boundaries can be determined analytically (see Appendix C for derivations). As the particle interaction is strongly repulsive (positively large g), the particles are uniformly distributed in every urn. On the other hand, the particles "prefer" to stay in the same urn (non-uniform distri-

V. RELAXATION TO STEADY STATES

In this section, we studied how the system evolves to its steady states. When the system is initially away from its steady state, it will relax (thermalized) towards the nearby stable NESS whose dynamics near the NESS is determined by the eigenvalues of a. From Eq.(14), and expand around the saddle point xsp, we get the evolution of the average of particle numbers in the first and second urn as

By increasing p from 0.5 to 1.0, it can be seen from the direct numerical calculation by Eq.(2), starting from the non-uniform initial state x(0) = (1, 0, 0), the relaxation time keep almost unchanged and the oscillation in the occupation gradually appears.

VI. NON-EQUILIBRIUM THERMODYNAMICS

We further examine the relationship between various thermodynamical quantities, first for general nonequilibrium states and then for the NESS cases. The Boltzmann (Gibbs, Shannon) entropy of the system is given by

S = - (n, t) log
n

(n,

t)/

N! n1!n2!n3!

(32)

where

the

multiplication

N! n1 !n2 !n3 !

is

due

to

the

degeneracy of (n, t) [2]. Applying Eq.(2), the entropy

production rate above can be written as

where the first term is the internal entropy production rate [42], which is positive-definite and only vanishes when the system is at equilibrium (Eq.(7)). It is the entropy produced during the irreversible process [43]. The second term refers to the entropy production rate for the reversible process [44] into the system. In the following, we will show that

(34)

where

dE dt

and

dW dt

are the rate of change of system

energy

and the rate of work done by the system, respectively.

From the first law of thermodynamics (conservation law

of energy), T deS can be identified as dQ, the heat flow

to the system from the environment. In general, during

thermalization process, dS  dQ = dE + dW .

Here Eq.(34) is proved, and hence a more general ther-

modynamic law

dS = diS + dE + dW

(39)

is derived. Note that Eqs. (38) and (39) hold even for

general non-equilibrium (non-steady state) processes.

For p

the system is at equilibrium and

That is, all macroscopic

are functionals of the probability distribution and hence

are

independent,

thus

has

sured by the internal EP diS) into heat energy (-dQ). Furthermore, the more non-uniform is the NESS (Fig.8),

the less is the particle flow (Fig.3), and hence the less

internal EP (Fig.9). Since the internal EP for the non-

uniform phase is always lower, the maximal EP principle

could not be used to select the favorable state in the co-

existence region. The first order non-equilibrium phase

transition between the uniform and non-uniform NESS

can also be observed by examining the internal EP rate

as the particle attraction varies. Fig.9 shows a sharp

drop near some threshold as g decreases and signifying

a first order transition from the high internal EP uni-

form NESS to the low internal EP non-uniform NESS.

Interestingly, there is a connection between the internal

EP rate and the non-uniformity in the NESS. As shown

where the function (ss) is some decreasing function, i.e., (ss) < 0. To have higher internal EP rates, the system should be more uniform (lower ss), or with a
higher direct jumping rate (higher p). Fig.10 agrees with
the conjecture that more uniform states have higher EP.

VII. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
In this paper, we extended the Ehrenfest urn model with interactions and directional jumps, allowing for detailed investigations of the non-equilibrium steady states and associated thermodynamics. We showed that the model provides different kinds of equilibrium and nonequilibrium states. Albeit simple the model may serve a convenient paradigm system to investigate a variety of statistical physics phenomena, ranging from equilibrium to NESS and even far from equilibrium situations.
In some situations, Landau type free energy can be constructed for NESS near a continuous phase transition [45, 46] or near the saddle-point(s) of NESS states [32]. However, it is still highly non-trivial to construct or establish the existence of NESS free energy in general, especially in our case of coexisting NESS related by first

At high direct jumping rate and moderate coupling constant, the system is far from equilibrium and cannot attain the steady state but limit cycle emerges instead. If the number of urns is more than three, chaotic behavior may be possible. Such models open the possibilities of investigating systems with different degree of non-equilibrium systematically. Detailed investigations will be reported elsewhere.

Appendix A: Steady State Solution of Multivariate Linear Fokker-Planck Equation

The multivariate linear Fokker-Planck equation for steady state reads

(A.42)

where a and b are constant matrices of dimension D ×
D. b is symmetric. The natural boundary condition, ss(x)||x| = 0 and iss(x)||x| = 0, is imposed. The steady state was already known [47]. In the follow-
ing, we briefly outline the solution.
The form of the solution is Gaussian,

D

ss(x) =

N 

2

det(-c)

1 2

exp[N

cijxixj ] (A.43)

ij

where c is a symmetric matrix determined by a and b. Substitute this form into Eq.(A.42), we get two constraints,

tr(a) = tr(bc) xt(ca)x = xt(cbc)x

(A.44) (A.45)

for any vector x. Eq.(A.44) is redundant (See below). Notice that cbc is symmetric but ca is not necessary
to be. xt(ca)x = xt(atc)x since they are both numbers. Hence Eq.(A.45) could be rewritten as

xt(ca + atc)x = 2xt(cbc)x

(A.46)

for any x, which gives

ca + atc = 2cbc

(A.47)

Take the transpose after multiplying c-1 from the left, one can deduce Eq.(A.44). Transform Eq.(A.47) into

ac-1 + c-1at = 2b

(A.48)

which uniquely determine c by noticing that the total number of independent matrix elements of c is equal to the total number of independent linear equations (both are D(D + 1)/2).
The stability condition for the solution in Eq.(A.43) is negative definiteness (or equivalently, the normalizability in infinite space). It is also equivalent to the fact that the odd (even) order principal minor of matrix c is negative (positive).

Appendix B: Detailed Balance in Multivariate Linear Fokker-Planck Equation
If the steady state ss(x) from the multivariate linear Fokker-Planck equation in Eq.(A.42) satisfies the princi-

9

ple of detailed balance, i.e.,
ss(x)W (x; t + dt|x; t) = ss(x)W (x; t + dt|x; t) (A.49)

then the steady state is also called the equilibrium state. W (x; t + dt|x; t) is the transition rate from one state x
at time t to another state x at time t + dt [48], which can
be expressed as

Notice that Eq.(A.49) is also equivalent to

ln

ss(x) ss(x)

= ln

W (x; t + dt|x; t) W (x; t + dt|x; t)

(A.52)

by taking logarithm. Subsitute Eq.(A.43) and Eq.(A.51) into Eq.(A.52), and then compare the coefficients of xixj and that of xixj at both sides, we have

(b-1a)ij + (b-1a)ji = 2cij (b-1a)ij - (b-1a)ji = 0

(A.53) (A.54)

in which it's matrix form is

c = b-1a

(A.55)

Here we derive the linear Fokker-Planck version of de-
tailed balance condition. It is important to notice that, if c = b-1a, then ab =
bat by direct substitution of Eq.(A.55) into Eq.(A.48). If we suppose ab = bat, then c = b-1a is the solution
of Eq.(A.48). Since the solution of Eq.(A.48) is unique
(See Appendix A), we could draw the conclusion that Eq.(A.55) holds. ab = bat is equivalent to c = b-1a.
Hence, ab = bat is another equivalent statement of
detailed balance of linear Fokker-Planck equation.

Appendix C: Derivation for the phase boundaries in the phase diagram

By analysing the stability of the saddle-points as a

function of p and g, one can obtain the phase diagram

for various stable states of the 3-urns model, with the

phase boundary determined analytically. First by direct

calculation of the matrix a at the uniform saddle point

of

gets

(A.56) (A.57)

Hence the uniform NESS state is stable for g > -3

(tr(a) < 0 and det(a) > 0). In addition, the eigenvalues

of a at the uniform NESS state can be easily calculated

to give

and hence the relaxation to the uniform NESS state always has an oscillatory component.

The phase boundary of pc(g) for the saddle-node bifurcation together with the g = -3 line for stable uniform
NESS are shown in the phase diagram (Fig.3 in main

text), classifying the dynamics of the 3-urns model into four regimes. In the region of g < -3 and p > pc(g), there is no stable NESS state with non-steady dynamics
