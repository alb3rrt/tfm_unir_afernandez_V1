Abstract. We give a brief review of the current understanding of renormalons of the static QCD potential in coordinate and momentum spaces. We also reconsider estimate of the normalization constant of the u = 3/2 renormalon and propose a new way to improve the estimate.
1 Introduction
The static QCD potential is an essential quantity for understanding the QCD dynamics, and at the same time it is suitable to understand renormalon of perturbative QCD. This is due to the following reasons. First, it is practically possible to observe renormalon in the perturbative series of the static QCD potential since it exhibits renormalon divergence at quite early stage, say at NLO. This is caused by the u = 1/2 renormalon, which is a very close singularity to the origin of the Borel uplane. Secondly, the perturbative series is known up to O(4s) [1­9]. This is the highest order that has been reached so far for physical observables. The explicit large-order coefficients are helpful to examine if the perturbative coefficients indeed follow the theoretically expected asymptotic form. Actually theoretical arguments already revealed detailed asymptotic behaviors of the perturbative coefficients caused by the renormalon at u = 1/2 and also that at u = 3/2.
In this paper we first give a review of the current theoretical understanding of the renormalons in the static QCD potential. We discuss it both in coordinate space and momentum space, where totally different features are found. In particular, we explain a simple formula, presented recently, to analyze renormalons in momentum space. Secondly, we move on to discussion on estimation of normalization constants of renormalons. Normalization constants are the only paremeter which cannot be determined by the current theoretical argument. One needs to know it to subtract renormalons in some methods [10­13]. In this paper, we perform a detailed test on methods to extract normalization constants. This aims at reconsidering the conclusions in Ref. [14] and Ref. [15]; Ref. [14] concluded that the normalization constant of the u = 3/2 renormalon cannot be estimated reliably with the NNNLO perturbative series while Ref. [15] stated that it is possible and estimated the normalization constant from the same series. Since this difference mainly stems from the difference in analysis method, we examine validity of different methods. After this examination, we propose a new way to improve the estimate; we propose to use the scale consistent with the scaling behavior of asymptotic form of perturbative coefficients, instead of

minimal sensitivity scale. This is a new proporsal in this paper. Finally we give conclusions and supplementary discussion. In Appendix we summarize the notation used here and basic relations to discuss renormalons.

2 Renormalons in coordinate space

The first IR renormalon of the static QCD potential is located at t = 1/(2b0) (or u = 1/2), which is called the u = 1/2 renormalon. This induces the O(r0) renormalon uncertainty to V (r). The important feature of this renormalon is that it is cancelled
in the total energy of the heavy quark and anti-quark system [16­18],

E = V(r) + 2mpole,

(1)

once the heavy quark pole mass mpole is expanded perturbatively in terms of a short distance mass. Considering analogy to the multipole expansion in classical electrody-
namics, one can understand this cancellation as a consequence of the fact that the O(r0) term couples to the total charge of the system [14, 19]. Since the system is color neutral, the O(r0) term and thus such an uncertainty should be absent. Once
we recognize that the cancellation takes place in the total energy, we can conclude
that the u = 1/2 renormalon uncertainty of V (r) (that of mpole) is independent of r (mpole). Otherwise, the cancellation does not hold. Hence the renormalon uncertainty is exactly proportional to the QCD dynamical scale:

Im V (r)±|u=1/2 = ±K1/2MS.

(2)

See Appendix for the definition of a renormalon uncertainty. The constant K1/2 is the undetermined parameter in this argument. Although the large-0 approximation gives the renormalon uncertainty proportional to MS, this is the case beyond the large-0 approximation.
The second IR renormalon is considered to be located at u = 3/2 from the study in the large-0 approximation and from the structure of the multipole expansion in pNRQCD [20]. The uncertainty is roughly given by  3 r2. Recently the detailed
MS
structure of the second IR renormalon has been investigated [14, 15] within the mul-
tipole expansion, which gives the static potential as

VQCD(r) = VS (r) + EUS(r) + · · · .

(3)

Here VS(r) is a Wilson coefficient in pNRQCD and identified as the perturbative computation of the static potential. Hence, VS(r) contains the u = 3/2 renormalon. EUS(r) is the first non-trivial correction in the r expansion, given by

EUS(r)

µ)


dt e-iV (r)t gr · Ea(t, 0)adj(t, 0)abgr · Eb(0, 0) ,

(4)

whose r dependence is roughly given by O(r2). Here VA(r) is a Wilson coefficient in pNRQCD and V  VO(r) - VS (r) denotes the difference between the potentials
of the octet and singlet states. Since the u = 3/2 renormalon uncertainty in VS(r) is considered to be canceled against that of EUS(r) [20], it should have the same r-dependence as EUS(r). Hence, we reveal the detailed r-dependence of EUS(r) to understand the detailed form of the u = 3/2 renormalon. In eq. (4), r-dependent quantities are VA(r; µ) and V (r) besides the power term, r2. However, since the IR renormalon in VS(r) is canceled against the UV contribution (t  0) of EUS(r),

we can approximate e-iV (r)t  1 in our present analysis and V (r) is not relevant here. Therefore the u = 3/2 renormalon uncertainty is given by1

and taken µ = r-1 to show the uncertainty in terms of s(r-1). In the last line of eq. (5), we used 0 = 1 = 02 and VA(r) = 1 + O(2s(r-1)). Again K3/2 is the

3 Renormalons in momentum space

Even though the perturbative series of the static potential in coordinate space suffers from seriously divergent behavior, that in momentum space has a good convergence property. Recently a simple formula to quantify the renormalon uncertainties of the momentum-space potential has been proposed [14]. In this formula, one considers Fourier transform of a coordinate-space renormalon uncertainty. Since renormalon uncertainties in coordinate space can be revealed systematically within the multipole expansion as seen above, it provides us with a clear way to study momentum-space renormalon uncertainties.
The momentum-space potential V (q) is defined by

-

4CF

V (q) q2

=

d3r e-iq·rVS (r).

(7)

Let us first consider a renormalon uncertainty of simple form in coordinate space:

Im v(r)± = ±Ku (2MSr2)u ,

(8)

where v(r) := rVS(r) is the dimensionless potential. The u = 1/2 renormalon uncertainty indeed takes this form. We calculate the corresponding renormalon uncertainty
in V (q) by considering Fourier transform of the above renormalon uncertainty. In

1 If we denote the UV contribution to EUS which cancels the IR renormalon by

EUS|UV contr. = VA2(r; µ)r2O(µ), it should be µ independent. To obtain eq. (5) we use

the fact that Im VS(r)±|u=3/2  VA2(r; µ)r2O(µ) = VA2(r; µ0)r2O(µ0) and then use eq. (6).

Note that exp[-2

0 s(µ0 )

dx(x)/(x)]O(µ0)

is

µ0

independent.

2 In Ref. [14], we mentioned that 1 is not known, but according to Ref. [15], it is known to

be zero. Here we use it and the correction factor in eq. (5) now becomes 1 + O(2s) although

in Ref. [14] it was 1 + O(s).

other words, we replace VS (r) in eq. (7) with Im [v(r)/r]± to obtain Im V (q)±. We

obtain

 (2u + 1) cos(u).

(9)

If u is a positive half-integer, this uncertainty completely vanishes since cos(u) = 0 and  (2u + 1) is finite. Hence, we conclude that the u = 1/2 renormalon is absent in the momentum-space potential. This is a revisit of the old conclusion obtained in
Ref. [18]. Our argument does not rely on diagramatic analysis.
We can easily extend this argument to study renormalon structure in momentum
space beyond the u = 1/2 renormalon. Since a renormalon uncertainty generally includes logarthims log(µ2r2) when we choose a general renormalization scale, we
assume that a renormalon uncertainty is given by

Im v(r)± = ±Ku (2MSr2)u

(10)

where an is a function of s(µ). The previous case corresponds to an = 0 for n  1. Repeating a similar calculation, we obtain the renormalon uncertainty in momentum
space induced by the above coordinate-space renormalon uncertainty as

(11)

Using this formula one can generally study the detailed renormalon structure in mo-

mentum space. In the case of the u = 3/2 renormalon the uncertainty is given by

Im v(r)±|u=3/2 = ±K3/2(µ)VA(r; µ)r33MS = ±K3/2(µ)(2MSr2)3/2{1 + 2e22s(µ) + 2[e3 + (2b0e2 + 2) log(µ2r2)]3s(µ) + · · · }
(12)

where we denote the perturbative series of VA(r) as VA(r) = 1 + e22s(µ) + [e3 + (2b0e2 + 2) log(µ2r2)]3s(µ) + · · · ; e2 and e3 are log independent constants. Here we used e1 = 0 = 1 = 0. Then we obtain the u = 3/2 renormalon uncertainty in momentum space as

(13)

We can see that the momentum-space renormalon uncertainty is suppressed by O(3s). We saw that in momentum space the u = 1/2 renormalon is absent and the
u = 3/2 renormalon is fairly suppressed. It means that the renormalons in coordinate space are caused by the q  0 region in the Fourier integral

(14)

This is exactly the case for the u = 1/2 renormalon and this is the case to a large extent also for the u = 3/2 renormalon. Hence, if we introduce an IR cutoff to the Fourier integral,

4 Estimates of normalization constant

The normalization constants of renormalons, K, cannot be determined by the above theoretical arguments. However it can be estimated from fixed order perturbative coefficients since the size of normalization constants is related to the asymptotic form of perturbative coefficients. The following two methods have been adopted in the literature to extract the normalization constant of a leading IR renormalon. Hereafter we study N instead of K; see eq. (31) for their relation.
Method A [21] From eq. (27), one considers the function,

(1 - b0t/u)1+u Bv(t)/(µ2r2)u .

(16)

Expanding this function in t and then substituting t  u/b0, one obtains the normalization constant Nu . Note that the convergence radius of the series expansion of the above function is  = u/b0 and on the convergence radius it gives us the correct value.
Method B [15, 22, 23] Since the asymptotic behavior of perturbative coefficients can be predicted except for the overall constant one can determine the normalization constant by

Nu

=

lim
n

dn dun (asym) /Nu

.

(17)

dnu(asym) is given by eq. (28).
Both methods should give an accurate answer if an all-order perturbative series is known.
It is stated in Refs. [15,22,23] that Method B practically shows faster convergence than Method A and gives more stable estimate against scale variation. Related to this, different conclusions were obtained in Ref. [14] and Ref. [15] about the estimate of the u = 3/2 renormalon normalization constant, N3/2. In Ref. [14], using Method A we concluded that we cannot reasonably estimate the normalization constant because a large uncertainty remains with the NNNLO perturbative series. In Ref. [15], on the other hand, the authors presented an estimation of the normalization constant using Method B from the same order perturbative series.
In this section, we reconsider the conclusions obtained in Ref. [14] by examining whether Method B actually gives more accurate results or not. We perform a validity test by considering a model-like all order perturbative series where exact normalization constants are known. In fact, since there are little cases where the normalization constant can be exactly known, such a test would be useful in examining efficiency and accuracy of the estimation methods. The model-like all order series considered here is, however, realistic enough and is beyond the large-0 approximation. In this test we also propose a way to improve the estimate. After this test, we estimate N3/2 from the NNNLO perturbative series using the improved method.

4.1 Test of estimation methods using model-like series

In the test, we use the all-order perturbative series constructed as follows [24]. We consider the NkLO perturbative series in momentum space with µ = q:

V (q) =

dm(µ = q)s(q)m+1.

Fig. 1. Estimate of the normalization constant N3/2 using Method A (left) and Method B (right). The black line shows the exact answer.

By rewriting s(q) in terms of s(µ), we obtain an all-order perturbative series in momentum space. Here we consider the (k + 1)-loop beta function. Next we perform Fourier transform and can obtain an all-order perturbative series in coordinate space. The perturbative series in coordinate space possesses renormalon uncertainties of u = 1/2, 3/2 . . . . We call this perturbative series the NkLL model series. The normalization constants of these renormalon uncertainties were exactly calculated in Ref. [14] (see eqs. (6.6) and (6.9) therein). In the following analysis, we use the N3LL model series. (We regularize the IR divergence in the three-loop coefficient in Scheme A defined in Ref. [14].)
Since we are now interested in the u = 3/2 renormalon, we consider the QCD force, f (r) = r2dV (r)/dr to eliminate the u = 1/2 renormalon. We denote its perturbative coefficient by dfn. Once we obtain the normalization constant of the force N3f/2 we can readily obtain the normalization constant of the potential by the relation N3f/2 = 2N3v/2. Hereafter N3/2 means N3v/2. We assume the number of flavors nf = 3 throughout this analysis.
We explain how we estimate a central value and its error from the nth order truncated series using Method A or B. We adopt a parallel estimation method to Ref. [15]. The central value at the nth order (which is estimated from the NnLO perturbative series) is determined at the minimal sensitivity scale µr of a normalization constant.3 To estimate the error we vary µr around the minimal sensitivity scale by the factor
2 or 1/ 2. In addition we obtain the (n - 1)th order result at the minimal sensitivity scale of the nth order result and examine the difference. The procedure so far is common to Method A and B. In Method B we also examine the difference caused by including 1/n correction [i.e. k = 1 term in eq. (28)] in dun(asym) or not. Finally combining the two (three) errors in Method A (Method B) in quadrature4, we obtain the nth order result with a total error.
We show the results in Fig. 3. We can see that Method B gives smaller error than Method A and shows faster convergence. This indeed agrees with the statement in Refs. [15, 22, 23], and we consider Method B superior.
However, it is worth noting that in both methods the error size does not show healthy convergence at small n as seen from Fig. 3; the estimated error does not always get smaller as n is raised in the region n 10 in Method B and such a tendency is worse in Method A.
3 If the minimal sensitivity scale is not found in the range 1/2 < µr < 5, we treat µr = 1 as the minimal sensitivity scale.
4 The final error is estimated in this way in Ref. [15] and we follow it.

Fig. 2. d log(dfn)/dL for various n. The expected value 3/2 is shown by the black line in each figure.

To improve the estimate, we propose to use, instead of the minimal sensitivity scale, a reasonable scale from the viewpoint of the asymptotic behavior. As shown in eq. (28) dfn should behave as dfn  (µ2r2)3/2 for scale variation5 if the u = 3/2 renormalon dominates the nth order perturbative coefficient. In this case, d log dfn/dL should be (or very close to) 3/2, where L = log(µ2r2). Showing d log dfn/dL is also useful to check whether the u = 3/2 renormalon dominates the nth perturbative coefficient or not. We show it in Fig. 2. From this figure, we consider that the dominance of the u = 3/2 renormalon sets in around n 5. In the estimate of the normalization constant, we propose to use the scale where d log dn/dL is close to 3/2. Quantitatively we choose the optimal scale µ0 such that the integral

is minimized. Then we determine a central value at µ = µ0 using Method B. We call this estimation method Method B'. In this method, as seen from Fig. 2, larger scale L  2 is favored, although in the previous analysis the minimal sensitivity scale appeared L  0. The way to estimate the error is parallel to the previous case; we examine the difference caused by the scale variation by the factor 2 or 1/ 2 and examine the difference of the (n - 1)th and nth order results at µ = µ0 . We also examine the impact of the 1/n correction.
We show the result in Method B'. The convergence is faster than Method B, and remarkably, the error gets smaller almost monotonically as n is raised, especially at n 5. Hence Method B' is optimal as far as we tested. Although the estimate at

Fig. 3. Estimate of the normalization constant N3/2 using Method B', where the scale consistent with the u = 3/2 renormalon is used instead of the minimal sensitivity scale. The
black line shows the exact answer. The range of the vertical axis is taken the same as Fig. 3.

n = 3, N3/2 = 0.64 ± 0.29, deviates from the exact value 0.143, this is not surprising because the renormalon would not be relevant enough at this order as suggested from Fig. 2.
Although we have used the N3LL model series so far, we did a parallel analysis using the N2LL model series. The situation was almost parallel. We found that (i)
Method B shows faster convergence than Method A, and (ii) Method B' makes the central value and its error converge faster than Method B.

4.2 NNNLO estimate of N3/2

We give the NNNLO estimate using Method B'. So far we have regularized the IR di-
vergence in the three-loop coefficient [20, 25­27] in Scheme A which is defined in [14].
(In this case our estimate at NNNLO reads N3/2 = 0.64 ± 0.29 as shown above, although the scaling behavior is far from the expected one from the u = 3/2 renor-
malon.) In this analysis we adopt the same regularization as Ref. [15] to make comparison easy. We show d log dfn/dL in Fig. 4. The difference from the upper left figure in Fig. 2 for n = 3 comes from the difference in regularization of the IR divergence. In this case, the behavior of d log df3 /dL is closer to 3/2 than that of Fig. 2. We obtain

N3/2 = 0.17 ± 0.05scale ± 0.02NNLO ± 0.021/n ± 0.004us = 0.17(5),

(20)

or

N3f/2 = 0.35 ± 0.1scale ± 0.04NNLO ± 0.051/n ± 0.008us = 0.35(11),

(21)

where the latter one is the result of the normalization for the force and can be compared with eq. (4.4) in Ref. [15], which reads 0.37(17). The error analysis is also parallel to Ref [15] (we assume symmetric errors in the first place though) and the last error shown by "us" shows the error associated with the ultrasoft contribution. In our analysis using Method B', the central value is extracted at µr = 1.82 or L = log(µ2r2) = 1.20 (see Fig. 4) while the analysis in Ref. [15] the central value is extracted at the minimal sensitivity scale µr = 1.52.

5 Conclusions and discussion

In this paper we gave a brief review of the current understanding of the renormalons at u = 1/2 and u = 3/2 of the static QCD potential in coordinate and momentum spaces. We also reconsidered estimation of the normalization constant of the u = 3/2 renormalon [14,15]. We examined the efficiency of different estimation methods based on a model-like all order series. Our study agrees with the statement in [15,22,23] that Method B is superior to Method A. To improve the estimate further, we proposed to use the consistent scale with an asymptotic behavior of perturbative coefficients, instead of the minimal sensitivity scale. We call it Method B'. As far as we tested, the proposed method gives most stable result and is most efficient, in particular in the sense that it basically makes the error smaller monotonically as the order of perturbation theory is raised.
We did not mention the complexity caused by IR divergences in perturbative coefficients [20, 25­27] in this paper. However, related to this, it was pointed out in Ref. [14] that an unfamiliar renormalon may arise at u = 1/2, whose uncertainty is specified as  MSr2V 2. Also ways to renormalize these IR divergences consistently with the renormalon uncertainties are discussed therein. These issues need to be further investigated for more precise understanding of renormalons in the static QCD potential.
Finally we mention a new method of renormalon subtraction. We argued that renormalons vanish or are fairly suppressed in momentum space in Sec. 3. Using this mechanism one can largely suppress renormalons of a general physical observable by considering Fourier transform to fictional "momentum space". Recently the renormalon subtraction method using this property has been proposed [28]. We consider that higher order computation combined with renormalon subtraction [10­13, 15, 28] is an important direction to give more accurate QCD predictions.

This is renormalization scale independent. Writing the renormalon uncertainty as



Im X± = ±Ku e-u/(b0s(r-1))(b0s(r-1))-u

sk,u ks (r-1)

with s0 = 1, we have the following relations,

and

sk,u = u (u - 1) · · · · · (u - k + 1)(b0/u)kck(µr = 1) for k  1. (32)

As discussed in Sec. 2 since the renormalon uncertainties in coordinate space are

given by

Ku (M 2 Sr2)u [1 + O(2s (r-1))],

(33)

(where O(2s) can be zero) one can see that u in eq. (30) is given by

u = ub1/b20

(34)

for u = 1/2 or 3/2 (where eq. (23) is used). One can also calculate sk,u and thus ck,u by expanding eq. (2) or (5) in s.
