## Abstract

We argue that the global causal structure of the singularity is not a purely geometric property but also depends on the collapsing matter-field leading to its formation. To show this, we investigate the global visibility of the end state of a spherically symmetric marginally bound Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi collapsing cloud (which is well studied in general relativity) in the framework of modified gravity having the generalized Lagrangian $R+\alpha R^2$ in the Einstein-Hilbert action. Here $R$ is the Ricci scalar, and $\alpha>0$ is a constant. As an example, we depict that for the same LTB metric governing the spacetime formed due to two different matter-fields, i.e., dust in general relativity and imperfect viscous fluid in $f(R)$ gravity, the singularity is locally visible in the former case, and globally visible in the latter case.
