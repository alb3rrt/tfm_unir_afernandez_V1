Abstract We prove that the reciprocal sum Sk(x) of the least common multiple of k  2 positive integers in N  [1, x] satisfies
Sk(x) = ck log2k-1 x + O(log2k-2 x)
where ck is a positive constant. This was conjectured in a stronger form in Hilberdink, Luca, and T┤oth [HLT, Remark 2.4].

1 Introduction

Let x  2 be an integer, N = {1, 2, 3, . . .} be the set of positive integers, and P be the set of prime numbers. Let (n1, . . . , nk) = gcd(n1, . . . , nk) and [n1, . . . , nk] = lcm(n1, . . . , nk) be the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm) of k-tuple of positive integers n1, . . . , nk respectively. The reciprocal sum of gcd is well understood through Dirichlet convolution of arithmetic functions. We have

1

= (k + 1) xk + O(xk-1).

n1,...,nkx (n1, . . . , nk)

 (k)

The reciprocal sums involving the lcm are more delicate. The r-th moment results were studied by Hilberdink and To┤th [HT] by means of multivariable Dirichlet series. They proved that for r > -1,

[n1, . . . , nk]r

where Cr,k is given as an Euler product. The results in case r = -1 in (1) and (2) were not obtained in [HT]. Hilberdink,

Luca, and To┤th [HLT] studied these sums and proposed some open problems. They

proved that as x  ,

:=

Then they conjectured that

Sk(x) = P2k-1(log x) + O(x-r)

and Vk(x)  kxk(log x)2k-k-1,
where P is a polynomial of degree 2k - 1 with a positive leading coefficient, r > 0, and k > 0.
Recently, the author [K] improved the error terms of (1) and (2) and provided the correct order of magnitude of (4). In fact,

[n1, . . . , nk]r

=

Cr,k xk(r+1) (r + 1)k

.

Moreover,

Vk(x) xk(log x)2k-k-1.

The method in this recent work was based on the study of G-wise coprime tuples by To┤th [To] and Hu [H1], [H2]. The case when G = Kk is a complete graph was sufficient.
In this paper, we prove that

Theorem 1.1. As x  , we have for k  2,

Sk(x)

=

n1 ,...,nk x

1 [n1, . . . , nk]

=

ck

log2k-1 x

+

O(log2k-2 x)

(5)

and

Uk(x) =

n1 ,...,nk x

1 [n1, . . . , nk]

= (2k - 1)ck log2k-2 x + O(log2k-3 x)

(6)

(n1 ,...,nk )=1

where ck > 0. For each k  2, ck > ck+1 and limk ck = 0.

Our method relies on the non-inductive argument in the counting of G-wise coprime tuples by Reyna and Heyman [RH]. By their argument, we are able to write Sk(x) as a sum over (2k - 1)-tuples of positive integers. We prove a general result on the reciprocal sum over G-wise coprime tuples in Section 2, then we obtain Theorem 1.1 as a corollary in Section 3. Computations of ck are obtained in Section 4. Our method here is not sufficient for proving the asymptotic formula Vk(x)  kxk log2k-k-1 x as x  . All asymptotic formulas given in this paper are for x  .

2 G-wise coprime k-tuples

Let x  2 be an integer and G = (V, E) be any graph with v  2 vertices and e  1 edges. Let V = {1, . . . , v} and E = { 1, . . . , e}  {(i, j) | 1  i < j  v} so that we have labels on vertices and edges of G. We are interested in a reciprocal sum over v-tuples (a1, . . . , av)  (N  [1, x])v such that (ai, aj) = 1 whenever (i, j)  E. Such v-tuples are called G-wise coprime in [H1], [H2], and [RH]. The asymptotic formula of the counting function of G-wise coprime tuples is obtained in [H2] by an inductive argument and [RH] by an non-inductive argument. For each vertex r, let Mr be the least common multiple of mi where the edge i connects the vertex r to another vertex of G. The number of G-wise coprime tuples given in [RH] is

vx

.

G-wise coprime

They obtained this formula by inclusion-exclusion principle. We provide a more direct approach to prove this. Recall that when we sum over the coprime pairs (a, b), we insert d|a,d|b х(d) into the summation. To each edge i = (a, b)  E, we insert х(mi) and the divisibility conditions mi|a, mi|b. Combining all divisibility conditions of each vertex r, we obtain the result. Similarly for reciprocal sums, we have

a1,...,avx a1 и и и av = m1,...,mex х(m1) и и и х(me) a1,...,avx a1 и и и av .

The asymptotic formula for the reciprocal sums over G-wise coprime tuples is as follows.

Theorem 2.1. Let d be the maximal degree of the vertices of G. We have

a1 ,...,av x

1 a1 и и и av

=

Pv(log x) + O(x-1 logv+d-1 x)

G-wise coprime

where P is a polynomial of degree v with a leading coefficient (G) > 0.

Proof. The inner sum of (7) is

1 m1,...,mex |х(m1) и и и х(me)| M1 и и и Mr-1Mr+1 и и и Mv

= O(logd x)

Thus, the O-terms in the product contribute O(x-1 logv-1+d x).

and the sums over mi > x for some i  e in the above contribute to the error term. In fact, it was proved in [RH] that if mi is the largest among m1, . . . , me, then

m1,...,mi-1mi mi>x mi+1,...,memi |х(m1) и и и х(me)| M1 и и и Mv = O

for some w = w(G) > 0. Applying the absolute convergence of the Dirichlet series of

Thus, the error term in (8) can be improved to O

The error term from the coefficients is therefore O(x-1 logs+v-s x) = O(x-1 logv x).

The leading coefficient of Pv (s = 0 above) is

that will be further discussed in Section 3 and Section 4.
Now we consider the reciprocal sum over G-wise coprime tuples with some hyperbolic
constraints jAi aj  x for some subsets Ai  V , i = 1, . . . s such that Ai = V . As noted in [RH], the sums over mi can be extended to all tuples of positive integers. If mi > x for some mi, then the inner sum over aj with j  i vanishes. Thus, we are considering the sum

In the last sum, the conditions r, br  x/Mr are dropped since the hyperbolic constraints imply them. The inner sum is more difficult than (7) due to the hyperbolic constraints. However, if we focus on the main term, then the problem becomes much easier.

Using this for the rightmost variable bv, we replace the summation by the integral over corresponding restrictions, then interchange the integral to the leftmost and repeat
until we replace all summations by the integrals. At each step of this repetition, the error term O(1) contributes to O(logv-1 x). The inner sum becomes

3 Coprimality Graph and Proof of Theorem 1.1

For any graph G = (V, E) with |V | = v, |E| = e, it is proved in [RH, Proposition 2] that the following functions fG : N  Z and fG+ : N  Z are multiplicative where

fG(m) =

х(m1) и и и х(me), fG+(m) =

|х(m1) и и и х(me)|.

M1 иииMv =m

M1 иииMv =m

Also, [RH] shows that fG(1) = fG+(1) = 1, fG(p) = fG+(p) = 0, fG(p2) = -e, fG+(p2) = e, and fG(p) = fG+(p) = 0, for all  > v. Thus, we obtain the absolutely convergent Dirichlet series

 fG(m) =

1 + fG(p2) + и и и + fG(pv) ,

By [RH, Lemma 3], fG(pa) depends only on G and a, not on p. Then we have w = w(G) > 0 such that

|fG(m)|

Thus, the series

Then

in [RH] given by the series

(G) =  х(m1) и и и х(me) =  fG(m)

m1,...,me=1 M1 и и и Mv

m=1

is absolutely convergent. For each F  E, let v(F ) be the number of non-isolated vertices of F . By [RH,
Lemma 3], we have 1
(G) = QG p pP
where QG(x) is a polynomial defined by

QG(x) = (-1)|F |xv(F ) = 1 + c2x2 + и и и + cvxv.
F E

For each prime p and a  2, we have ca = fG(pa). Moreover, c2 = -e by [RH, Section 2].
By [H2, Theorem 1], we have another expression for (G).

v

(G) =

where im(G) is the number of S  V with |S| = m such that no two vertices are connected by an edge in G (such a set is called independent set). In view of this expression, (G) > 0 for any graph with v  1. Analyzing the proofs of these papers, we have the following identity

QG(x) =

v
(-1)|F |xv(F ) = im(G) (1 - x)v-m xm

F E

m=0

for x = 1/p for each prime p. This gives a proof that the above holds for any x. We may have an interesting combinatorial proof to the above identity. However, this is not the main topic of our result. We do not give the combinatorial proof here.

3.1 The cases k = 2, 3 for Sk

For k = 2, recall by putting a3 = (n1, n2), n1 = a1a3, and n2 = a2a3 that

G-wise coprime

a1a3,a2a3x

a1a3,a2a3x

where G is the graph G = (V, E) with V = {1, 2, 3} and E = {(1, 2)}. It is easy to see

that

(G) =

6 2

and

vol(D) =

1 3

where

D

is

{(x, y, z)  [0, 1]3|x + y

 1,

x+z

 1}.

Thus, by Theorem 2.2, we have

S2(x)

=

n1,n2x

1 [n1, n2]

=

2 2

log3 x +

O(log2 x).

Applying Dirichlet hyperbola method [Ti, (12.1.4)] to the inner sum over ar, r  3, it is also possible to obtain a polynomial P3(x) of degree 3 such that

log2 x

S2(x) = P3(log x) + O

 x

.

(10)

A proof of (10) was given in [HLT, Theorem 2.1]. The main method is Dirichlet hyperbola method, but the approach is different from ours.
For k = 3, we write d = (n1, n2, n3), n1 = af gd, n2 = bef d, n3 = cegd, and [n1, n2, n3] = abcdef g. This decomposition was used in [FF]. Thus, S3(x) becomes
1 abcdef g
a,b,c,d,e,f,gx G-wise coprime af gd,bef d,cegdx
where G = (V, E) with V = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} and

E = {(a, b), (a, c), (a, e), (b, c), (b, g), (c, f ), (e, g), (e, f ), (f, g)}.

Therefore, by Theorem 2.2, we have S3(x) = (G)vol(D) log7 x + O(log6 x).

Figure 1: Coprimality graphs for k = 2, 3 (GeoGebra)

Here, D is a 7-dimensional polytope {(a, b, c, d, e, f, g)  [0, 1]7|a + f + g + d  1, b + e + f + d  1, c + e + g + d  1}.

The volume of this polytope is 11/3360 by SageMath computation.
We compute (G) by Hu's expression. We have i0(G) = 1 due to the empty set, i1(G) = 7 due to the vertices, i2(G) = 12 due to the 6 pairs of vertices without d which do not form edges in G and 6 pairs of vertices with d, i3(G) = 6 due to adjoining d to the 6 pairs of vertices without d, and im(G) = 0 if m  4. We obtain an Euler product and an approximation by Python.

3.2 Proof of Theorem 1.1

The coprimality graph for k = 2 is G2 = ({1, 2, 3}, {(1, 2)}) as in Figure 1. We construct Gk inductively. Assume that Gk = (Vk, Ek) = ({1, . . . , 2k - 1}, {1, . . . , ek}) is the coprimality graph for some k  2. Regard the labels of vertices with k-bit binary
strings that contains at least one 1,

Vk = {1 = 0 и и и 01, 2 = 0 и и и 10, 3 = 0 и и и 11, . . . , vk = 2k - 1 = 1 и и и 11}.

The hyperbolic constraints {Ak,i}ik are given by the rule that Ak,i is the set of elements in Vk such that i-th binary digit (from the right) is 1. Then for each i  k, let

ni =

aj  x.

jAk,i

Figure 2: Vertex labeling for k = 2, 3 (GeoGebra)

Our inductive hypothesis is that under the coprimality conditions Ek = {1, . . . , ek} imposed on (a1, . . . , avk)  (N  [1, x])vk, we have

[n1, . . . , nk] = aj, (n1, . . . , nk) = avk ,

Let Vk+1 = {1, . . . , vk+1 = 2k+1 -1} be the set of (k +1)-bit binary strings that contains at least one 1. Then we may also obtain Vk+1 by concatenating 1 on the left for each element in Vk and including 2k = 10 и и и 0. Let Ak+1,i = Ak,i  {2k + j |j  Ak,i} for each i  k and let Ak+1,k+1 be the set of elements in Vk+1 starting with 1. This process of concatenating and including one element can be viewed as introducing

nk+1 =

aj  x.

jAk+1,k+1

For each i  k, we redefine ni's as

ni =

aj  x.

jAk+1,i

For each edge (j, )  Ek, let ej, = {2k + j, j} О {2k + , }. We write

Ek =

ej, .

(j, )Ek

9

The edges in Ek extend the existing edges. By the inductive hypothesis,

[n1, . . . , nk] =

aj .

j2k+1-1,j=2k

For each i  k, let P (ni, nk+1) be a product of aj where j's binary digits start with 1 and i-th digit (from the right) is 1. That is,

P (ni, nk+1) =

aj .

j Ak+1,k+1 Ak+1,i

We want to have P (ni, nk+1) = (ni, nk+1). To this end, we need to impose new coprimality conditions from

ni

,

nk+1

= 1, i  k.

P (ni, nk+1) P (ni, nk+1)

Thus, the newly imposed coprimality conditions for each i  k are between the following.

1. aj's with j's binary digits starting with 0 and the i-th digit is 1. 2. aj's with j's binary digits starting with 1 and the i-th digit is 0.

Let Ek+1 be the set of edges from these new conditions (j1, j2)  Vk2+1 where j1 from 1 and j2 from 2 so that

Ek+1 =

Ack+1,k+1  Ak+1,i О Ak+1,k+1  Ack+1,i .

ik

Then we include these into the set of edges,

By De Morgan's law,

Ek+1 = Ek  Ek+1.

([n1, . . . , nk], nk+1) = [(n1, nk+1), . . . , (nk, nk+1)]. By the edges in Ek+1, we have for each i  k,
(ni, nk+1) = P (ni, nk+1). By the edges in Ek and the inductive hypothesis, we have

([n1, . . . , nk], nk+1) = [P (n1, nk+1), . . . , P (nk, nk+1)] =

aj .

2k +1j 2k+1 -1

Hence, we obtain

[n1, . . . , nk+1]

=

[[n1, . . . , nk], nk+1]

=

[n1, . . . , nk]nk+1 ([n1, . . . , nk], nk+1)

=

jVk+1

aj .

10

Moreover, we obtain by the edges in Ek+1,

(n1, . . . , nk+1) = ((n1, . . . , nk), nk+1) = a2k+1-1.

We have constructed the coprimality graph Gk+1 so that

Gk+1-wise coprime

ik+1, jAk+1,i aj x

This completes the construction of ni, i  k through aj's so that the coprimality conditions are satisfied. Let ji be the i-th binary digit from the right. We may also obtain aj's directly in terms of ni, i  k by setting

aj =

pp(aj )

pP

where p(aj) is the Euclidean length of the interval

[0, p(ni)] [0, p(ni)]c.

ik ji=1

ik ji=0

Thus,

p(aj) = min p(ni) - max p(ni).

ik

ik

ji=1

ji=0

Then the coprimality conditions listed in Ek are satisfied. Hence, (5) follows from Theorem 2.2 with ck = (Gk)vol(Dk) where





 Dk = (u1, . . . uvk )  [0, )vk ik,

 uj  1 .



jAk,i



To prove (6), let Vk - {vk} = Vk and Gk = (Vk, Ek). Our construction guarantees that Ek does not contain any edges connecting to the vertex vk. The set of edges of Gk and that of Gk are identical. Then we have by [RH],
(Gk) = (Gk).

For Uk(x), we use

where Ak,i = Ak,i - {vk} for each i  k. By Theorem 2.2, the sum equals

(Gk)vol(Dk) log2k-2 x + O(log2k-3 x)

where





 Dk = (u1, . . . uvk-1)  [0, )vk-1 ik,

 uj  1 .

Interchanging the volume integral for Dk and put the integral over uvk the leftmost,

we have

Dk =

Hence, (6) follows. Clearly for any k  2, we have (Gk) > (Gk+1) by observing that

(Gk) = ((Vk+1, Ek)) > ((Vk+1, Ek+1)) = (Gk+1).

Consider a standard embedding of Dk into [0, )vk+1. We see that

Therefore, ck  0 quite rapidly as k  . This completes the proof of Theorem 1.1.

4 Computation of (Gk) and vol(Dk)

4.1 The number (Gk)
In [HLT, (2.5)], it was proved that

k(n) n



Sk(x)

nx

12

where k(n) = n1,...,nkN 1. Using k is multiplicative and k(p) = 2k - 1 for each
[n1 ,...,nk ]=n
prime p, they applied [HLT, Theorem 2.2] to prove

k(n) = Ck log2k-1 x + O(log2k-2 x) n (2k - 1)!
nx

where

1 2k-1  ( + 1)k - k

Ck =

1- p

. p

pP

=0

In view of Theorem 2.2, we have

k(n) = n
nx

a1,...,avk x

=

(Gk)vol(Tk) log2k-1 x + O(log2k-2 x)

Gk-wise coprime

a1иииavk x

where

Tk = {(u1, . . . , uvk )  [0, )vk | u1 + и и и + uvk  1}.

Since

vol(Tk)

=

(2k

1 -1)!

,

we

have

1 2k-1  ( + 1)k - k

(Gk) = Ck =

1- p

. p

pP

=0

Thus, we are able to evaluate (Gk) without knowing precise information about Gk. We have three expressions for (Gk) from [RH], [H2], and [HLT]. These suggest the
identities for |x| < 1,

vk



(-1)|F |xv(F ) =

im(Gk) (1 - x)vk-m xm = (1 - x)2k-1 (( + 1)k - k)x.

F Ek

m=0

=0

Analyzing the proofs in these papers, the values at 1/p for each prime p are identical.
Thus, we see that the above identities are indeed true.
We may recover some information about Gk by the last expression. For example, we obtain the number of edges in Gk by equating the coefficients of x2, thus

-|Ek| = (3k - 2k) - (2k - 1)2 +

2k - 1 2

= 3k - 2k-1(2k + 1)

so that |E2| = 1, |E3| = 9, and |E4| = 55. Also, we have


kx =

1

k
S(k, m)m!

x

m

1-x

1-x

=0

m=1

where S(k, m) is the Stirling number of the second kind. Then

 (( + 1)k - k)x = 1 k S(k, m)m!

.

By

1 x

=

x 1-x

-1, we obtain im(Gk) in terms of the Stirling numbers.

To see this,

let

t

=

x 1-x

,

we

have

vk
im(Gk) tm =

1 1+
t

k
S(k, m)m! tm.

m=0

m=1

Hence,

im(Gk) = S(k, m)m! + S(k, m + 1)(m + 1)!.

Since the above vanishes when m > k, we have

k

(-1)|F |xv(F ) =

S(k, m)m! + S(k, m + 1)(m + 1)! (1 - x)vk-m xm.

F Ek

m=0

Therefore, we are able to write fGk(pa) in terms of the Stirling numbers and binomial coefficients. The following are the polynomials used in the Euler product of (Gk) obtained after expanding the right side.

QG2(x) = 1 - x2, QG3(x) = 1 - 9x2 + 16x3 - 9x4 + x6, QG4(x) = 1 - 55x2 + 320x3 - 891x4 + 1408x5 - 1155x6 + 1155x8 - 1408x9
+ 891x10 - 320x11 + 55x12 - x14.

4.2 The polytope Dk
As noted in Section 3.1, the volume of polytope defined by a finite set of inequalities can be computed by a SageMath worksheet. Since vol(Dk) = vol(Dk)/(2k - 1), we use the following code to generate a SageMath workwheet for Dk.
file2 = open('Polytope.txt', 'w+') k=input() s=[[0 for y in range(2**k-1)] for x in range(k+2**k-2)] for i in range(k): #Giving hyperbolic constraints.
s[i][0]=1 for j in range(2**k-1):
if j&(1<<i): s[i][j]=-1 #When i-th bit from the right is 1, assign -1.
for z in range(k,k+2**k-2): #Restricting variables to be nonnegative. s[z][z-k+1]=1
file2.write('P=Polyhedron(ieqs=') file2.write(str(s)) file2.write(')') file2.write('\n') file2.write('P.volume()') file2.close()

The output in case k = 4 is
P=Polyhedron(ieqs=[ [1, -1, 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, -1, 0], [1, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0, -1], [1, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, -1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]) P.volume()
Running these on SageMath, we obtain vol(D3) = 11/480 and vol(D4) = 739/25830604800. Thus, vol(D3) = 11/3360 and vol(D4) = 739/387459072000.
