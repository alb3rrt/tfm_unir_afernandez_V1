It has been shown [1] that many seemingly contradictory experimental findings concerning the superconducting state in Sr2RuO4 can be accounted for as resulting from the existence of an assumed tetra-critical point at near ambient pressure at which dx2-y2 and gxy(x2-y2) superconducting states are degenerate. We perform both a Landau-Ginzburg and a microscopic mean-field analysis of the effect of spatially varying strain on such a state. In the presence of finite xy shear strain, the superconducting state consists of two possible symmetry-related time-reversal symmetry (TRS) preserving states: d ± g. However, at domain walls between two such regions, TRS can be broken, resulting in a d + ig state. More generally, we find that various natural patterns of spatially varying strain induce a rich variety of superconducting textures, including half-quantum fluxoids. These results may resolve some of the apparent inconsistencies between the theoretical proposal and various experimental observations, including the suggestive evidence of half-quantum vortices [2].

I. INTRODUCTION

If it happens that superconducting (SC) orders with two distinct symmetries are comparably favorable for some microscopic reason, it is possible to have a two-parameter phase diagram (e.g. T and isotropic strain, 0) that exhibits a multicritical point (e.g. at = and T = T ) at which the transition temperatures, Tc, of the two different orders coincide, as shown in Fig. (1a). For instance, a change from s± to d-wave pairing is thought to occur as a function of doping in certain Fe-based superconductors [3], and it was recently conjectured that the layered perovskite Sr2RuO4 (SRO) [4] under ambient conditions is "accidentally" close to such a multicritical point involving either dx2-y2 and g-wave [1] or dxy and s-wave [5] pairing. Even though both orders by themselves transform as one dimensional irreducible representations (irreps) of the point-group symmetries, near such a multi-critical point the system can exhibit a variety of features usually associated with multi-component SC order that transform according to a higher dimensional irrep (e.g. a p-wave). Conversely, for a SC order parameter that transforms according to a 2d irrep, the point of zero shear-strain, shear = 0, can be viewed as a special case of such a multi-critical point in the T shear plane, as shown in Fig. (1b). In both cases, the response of the different components of the SC order parameter to specific components of the strain tensor can produce a variety of novel effects.
Specifically, the proximity of a multicritical point implies that even small amplitude spatial variations of the strain field can locally stabilize different distinct forms of superconducting order in different domains. In this paper, we treat the case of a tetracritical point involving dx2-y2 (B1g) and gxy(x2-y2)-wave

(A2g) pairing channels, where, as in Fig. (1a), for the uniform case the coexistence regime is a d+ig SC with spontaneously broken time-reversal-symmetry (TRS). We study this problem in the mean-field approximation, both from an effective field theory (Landau-Ginzburg/non-linear sigma model) and a microscopic perspective. Following a similar line of reasoning as in Ref. [6] (where TRS breaking near dislocations was investigated), we show that inhomogeneous strain can lead to a highly inhomogeneous SC state in which TRS breaking is strongly manifest only along a network of domain-walls separating regions in which the local strain favors one or another TRS preserving combination of the d and g order parameters. However, this only occurs when the unstrained system is close enough to the tetra-critical

2

point - in a sense that we make precise. We also show that appropriate strain patterns can induce an order parameter texture with a spontaneous fractional magnetic flux that equals a half superconducting flux quantum in under a range of circumstances.
The results we obtain are quite general as they follow largely from symmetry considerations. As an application of these ideas, we explore their implications for the still vexed problem of settling the symmetry of the superconducting state in SRO [4]. Here, there are a number of proposals, each of which can plausibly account for a subset of the experimental observations. Triplet pairing of any sort has seemingly been ruled out by recent NMR experiments [7­9]. Moreover, recent ultra-sound measurements [10, 11], taken at face value, require a two-component order parameter arising from the system in the absence of strain being accidentally tuned to a multi-critical point involving dxy & s or dx2-y2 & g wave pairing. However, there are at least two sets of phenomena that seemingly challenge these theoretical proposals:
· Below a critical temperature, Ttrsb, the SC phase appears to break time-reversal symmetry [12­14] where at zero shear strain Ttrsb  Tc, while in the presence of substantial B1g shear strain these two transitions are split, such that Ttrsb < Tc. However, specific heat measurements under the same circumstances show no signature of the TRS breaking transition [15, 16]. An additional constraint on theory is the recent observation [17] that Tc can be depressed with the application of hydrostatic pressure (i.e. compressive uniform strain 0 < 0) without producing a detectable splitting between Tc and Ttrsb - an observation that was declared to rule out any theory based on an accidental degeneracy between two symmetry-distinct superconducting orders.
· A somewhat complicated experiment on mesoscale crystals adduced evidence of the existence of a topological excitation capable of admitting a half-quantum of magnetic flux [2]. This has been argued [18] to constitute direct evidence that the SC state is a chiral p + ip state, despite the contrary evidence from the NMR studies [7­9]. Although additional evidence of half quantum vortices has been recently reported [19], it is still possible that there is an alternative explanation for the observation that does not involve fractional vortices. However, taking the result at face value presents us with the need to identify a route to fractional vortices in a singlet SC.
In this context, our present results provide, as a

matter of principle, possible routes to reconcile both these observations with the conjectured theoretical scenario.
· Despite the fact that the crystals involved in these experiments are paragons of crystalline perfection, the only plausible interpretation of the specific heat data is that the TRS breaking involves a small fraction of the electronic degrees of freedom. This can be naturally accounted for by the theoretically expected extreme sensitivity of the SC order to local strain, and the fact that the TRS breaking d+ig order arises only in a network of domainwall-like regions at which | 0 - | and | shear| are vanishingly small. Moreover, so long as the typical magnitude of the inhomogeneous strain is larger than an applied strain, no significant splitting between Tc and Ttrsb is expected.
· The fact that a half-quantum vortex can be the ground-state in the presence of a suitable strain texture similarly opens the possibility that the experimental evidence of fractional vortices in SRO is likewise consistent with the propsed scenario.

Where  is the vector of Pauli matrices.
The complex scalar fields D, G are normalized so that the stiffness constants are equal, i.e., d = g  , and that quartic isotropic coupling constant 0 = 1. We have used units such that the Cooper pair charge 2e = 1. The quantity  = (1, 0, 3) represents the effect of local strain as a two-component

3

vector, where 3 = 3(x, y) is proportional to the deviation of the isotropic (A1g) strain from its critical value 0 and 1 = 1(x, y) is proportional to the
shear (B2g, i.e., xy) strain. The free energy at A = 0 respects TRS, has a U (1) symmetry associated with the overall superconducting phase and, for 1 = 0, a D4h point group symmetry that involves both space and the order parameters. For example, under a rotation by /2, x  y and y  -x, D  -D and G  G. The quartic terms determine the favored form of the ordered state: 3 > 0 favors coexistence of non-zero d and g pairing and 1 > 0 favors the TRS breaking combinations d ± ig. The microscopic BdG calculations reported in Sec. (III A) yield 1 & 3 > 0.

B. Non-linear sigma model
In the special case, j = j = 0 for all j > 0 and 3 = 0,  = 0, the free energy has a global SU (2) symmetry that relates the two components of the order parameter. Not too close to Tc, and to the extent that this symmetry is not too strongly broken, the variations of the magnitude of the order parameter are unimportant. This allows us to associate the relevant order parameter values with a point on a Bloch sphere n^  S2 via the isomorphism between CP1 and S3/U (1), i.e.,

C. Ground State

Let us first determine the ground state of a system in the presence of a uniform strain vector  using the Ginzburg-Landau free energy (1). For calculational convenience, we will consider the case 3 = 0 and 1 = 3 =  > 0 (in which case the free energy is invariant under a U (1) symmetry associated with rotations of n^ around n2). The general case is analyzed in Appendix (V B).
The potential term V of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy can be rewritten as a sum of two terms,

where m is the projection of the normalized vector n^ onto the e^1-e^3 plane and m  |m| = n21 + n23, where nj  n^ · e^j. The potential is minimized when m points in the same direction as  so that the

which corresponds to two distinct values n^(related by time-reversal symmetry) with n2 = ± 1 - m2. For / > 0  -, we have

(9)

so that n2 = 0. Finally, || = 0 for  < -0. Henceforth, we restrict our attention to the case 0 > 0 so || > 0 and that the nature of the ground state is determined by the value of /0.
In the limit of small strain  0 so that m  0, n^ points in the ±e^2 direction, which corresponds to a TRSB d ± ig state. Conversely, if   0 so that m = 1, the Bloch vector n^ points in the same direction as  as denoted by the solid black dot in Fig. (2). This corresponds to a TRS preserving state determined by the the local strain. From now on, when we discuss a situation in which the strain is nonzero, we shall implicitly assume that   0 and thus the uniform ground state is as in (9).

D. Domain walls
We now consider the behavior of the order parameter  in the presence of spatially varying strain. As it simplifies the analysis, we will do this in the context of the non-linear sigma model (3). To begin with, we consider a domain wall separating a region at y < 0 in which the shear strain favors d - g pairing (1 < 0) from a region at y > 0 that favors d + g (1 > 0). We consider the system to be translationally invariant in the directions parallel to the domain wall.
Far from the domain wall, the relative phase (y) and amplitudes are determined by the strain. Thus, at long distances, the only property of the order parameter texture that can depend on the nature of the domain wall is the change in the global phase, . If we choose the global phase such that the order parameter is real at y  -, across the domain wall the order parameter must change from d - g to ei(d + g).
If TRS is preserved everywhere (i.e. if the order parameter can be chosen to be real), then the only possible values of  are 0 and . Any other value of  requires TRSB on the domain wall, which consequently means that there must be two symmetry related optimal values, ±.

particular, if  = /2, then only the relative phase 

changes from  =   0.

Below we discuss the derivation of  in several cases. This is done by minimizing the free energy in Eq. (3) in the presence of a given strain texture. To be concrete, we will consider the case in which aeyxc3rp(oyrse)ss±s=tehde¯awd3soiitmashaat¯irnacjo>wencastltolarsny0utco[ha2nn0t]dt.hhaetT1Bh(ye1lo)(rcyceh)hsuaslnptgh±ecesar¯en1s,igbaaness shown in Fig. (2), where the arrow indicates the direction of evolution as y varies from - to +.
To begin with, consider some general results that follow without explicit calculation:

· Away from the multicritical point: Con-

In this case, and even at

the "center" of the domain wall, defined as the

point y = 0 where 1(0) = 0, there is no local tendency to TRSB. The optimal order parame-

ter texture lies in the e^1-e^3 plane - as indicated by the blue trajectory in Fig. (2). Here the G

component of the order parameter vanishes at

y = 0 and is negative on one side and positive

on the other. Obviously, the analogous consid-

Moreover, if the strain fields vary slowly on the scale of the superconducting coherence length, then the order parameter will be well approximated by the uniform state corresponding to the local value of the strain. Thus, the order parameter texture is not confined to the e^1-e^3 plane, as shown by the green trajectory. This implies that both components of the order parameter remain non-zero everywhere, and thus that  = g - d = ±. However, how much of this phase change is accommodated by changing the phase of D or G depends on energetics; if the D wave order is everywhere dominant, then d  0 and hence   /2, while if the D and G are of nearly equal strength, then |g|  |g| and hence   0. Clearly, for intermediate cases, 0 < || < /2.

· Narrow domain wall near the multicritical point: Here, the nature of the solution depends on a host of microscopic details. Since "narrow" and "broad" refer to the width of the domain wall relative to the superconducting coherence length, and given that the superconducting coherence length diverges as T  Tc, at least near Tc this is likely the most physically relevant situation. We will thus treat this case more explicitly below.

As an explicit model of a narrow domain wall, let

1(r 0 be

3(r )  in which

goes from - to , n^ (y) follows a trajectory that

lies in a plane  intersecting the Bloch sphere - of

the sorts illustrated by the different colored paths in

Fig. (2). When this plane is perpendicular to e^2, TRS is preserved (blue line) while all other trajec-

tories break TRS. A more complete solution of the

problem does not result in qualitative changes in the

conclusions. With these simplifications, the domain

wall energies F can be computed analytically (see

Appendix (V C)).

We can then find the plane  with minimum

domain wall energy for each set of values and compute the corresponding change in

E. Topological Point Defects
The domain walls we have discussed are natural strain patterns that are plausibly generic in real materials. In addition, because there are two components of the strain-dependent vector, , one can also conceive of vortex-like defects with point-like cores in 2d or line-like cores in 3d. Here, we consider a pattern of strain such that along any path encircling the origin, (r ) rotates by 2. Given such a strain pattern, we can use the non-linear sigma model to explore the properties of the resulting SC order parameter texture that results.

1. Vorticity and associated flux

Far from the defect core, the form of the SC order parameter (up to its overall phase) is essentially determined by the local pattern of strain. Regardless the SC order parameter texture, the current density,
J = -F/A, can be computed exactly from the nonlinear sigma model (3) since variations in mag-
nitude || do not couple to the vector potential A. From this it follows that

Jx = ~[x + ax - Ax]

and similarly for Jy. Far from the core under most circumstances, J  0; indeed, beyond a London penetration depth it vanishes exponentially. Thus, we can invert Eq. (10) to obtain an expression for
A in terms of the SC order parameter texture valid wherever J is negligible. Then, by integrating the vector potential A along a contour C that encloses

the origin at a distance, we obtain an expression (modulo an additive integer) for the enclosed flux  in units of the superconducting flux quantum 0 = h/2e:

where  is the solid angle enclosed by the contour of n^ on the Bloch sphere.
Note that when [n^ ×µn^ ]1 = 0 along C, the second term vanishes and thus the flux quantum captured is expressed entirely in terms of the Berry phase /4. In particular, since strain stabilizes a TRS preserving state, we will typically be interested in situations in which n^ · e^2 = 0 far from the defect core, insuring that this condition is satisfied. In this case, whenever n^ follows a trajectory that encircles the origin (as in Fig. (4b)), there must be an associated halfflux quantum of flux bound to the defect.

2. Example of a strain-induced half-quantum fluxoid

We now consider an explicit version of such a

strain texture (Fig. (4a)), consisting of four do-

mains separated by domain walls that intersect at

the origin.

far away from the origin we are regime where the preferred order

parameter is set by the strain and TRS is preserved.

As indicated by the labels, the D component is en-

hanced compared the G component for x > 0. For

x < 0, the G component is favored. The combina-

tion d + g is favored for y > 0, while d - g is favored

for y < 0.

Let us now consider a closed path C encircling

the origin (Fig. (4a)), where the preferred SC state

(up to the global phase) is denoted in each quad-

rant, e.g., D + g denotes a TRS preserving SC state

with dominant D component. Since the contour C is

far away from the origin, the domain walls between

quadrants are narrow, and the strain is always suffi-

ciently large such that TRS breaking is never favored

locally. Fig. (4b) shows the trajectory of the order

parameter on the Bloch sphere, in which each seg-

ment of the contour is color coded to correspond to

that in the top diagram. We then see that the OP

 wraps around by 2 while being confined to the

e^1-e^3 plane and thus [n^ × µn^ ]1 = 0 along the contour. Eq. (11) thus implies that this strain texture

captures a half quantum of flux.

(b)
FIG. 4. A strain induced half quantum fluxoid. (a) Real space contour around a topological point defect, along which the strain vector  winds by 2. The dashed cross shows the location of a  mismatch in the phase of the order parameter. D + g in the x > 0, y > 0 quadrant represents order parameter with a dominant D component and a smaller G component, and similarly in the other quadrants. (b) Corresponding trajectory of the order superconducting order parameter along the Bloch sphere. TRS is preserved along the path. Each segment of the contour is color coded so that the same colors in the bottom and top figure correspond to each other.
At an intuitive level, the same conclusion can be reached by considering the nature of the order parameter texture along the various line segments in Fig. (4a). Since it is energetically favorable to keep the dominant piece of the SC order parameter uniform, the overall phase () is constant along any of the segments other than the red one, along which the dominant portion of the order parameter changes sign, favoring  = . Of course, this change in phase will in actuality be spread out along the entire path, but this argument captures the  phase mismatch along the close path that results in a half quantum vortex.

The dashed line represents the relative phase  given by the left y-axis, while the solid (red, green) lines represent the amplitudes |D|, |G|, given by the right y-axis. Similarly, the bottom two panels represent the evolution of the uniform state for sample points (II) and (III) under shear gd strain.

We now address these same issues from a more microscopic perspective in the context of BardeenCooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean-field theory. Specifically, we solve the self-consistency equations for a generic 2D Hamiltonian with attractive d and gwave interactions, and with spatially varying bandstructure parameters that encode the same patterns of spatially varying strain discussed above.

Let the full Hamiltonian Hfull = H0 + H1 be defined on a 2D square lattice. The free Hamiltonian H0 is characterized by the (single-band) TRSpreserving hopping matrix t so that

H0 = -

A. Uniform states
To begin with, we study the uniform case tuned close to the multi-critical point. In Fig. (5a) we show the mean-field ground-state phase diagram of the microscopic model defined above as a function of the pairing interactions, d and d, in the absence of "strain" (i.e. for gs = gd = 0), for t = 0.4 and for the chemical µ chosen so that the mean electron density per site is n  0.3. There are three distinct phases in this case: a pure d wave phase for d sufficiently larger than g, a pure g wave phase for sufficiently large d, and a relatively narrow coexistence phase centered at the the line d = g. The latter phase has a relative phase  = ±/2, i.e., it is a d ± ig phase, for all parameters studied here.
To illustrate the effect of shear strain, we chose representative points in the phase diagram indicated by the three points in Fig. (5a), and explore the evolution of the ground-state order upon application of uniform strain, i.e. non-zero gd or gs. Shown in Fig. (5b) are the magnitude of the d and g components of the order parameter, |D| and |G|, as well as the relative phase, , for these three cases:
· The top two panels of Fig. (5b) show the evolution with strain of the case in which we are most interested - the strain-free ground state has d ± ig pairing. As the shear strain, gd , is varied, |D| and |G| remain comparable, although both increase slightly, roughly in proportion to |gd |2 - which is a density of states effect. More dramatically, the relative phase evolves smoothly, up to a critical value at which TRS is restored, i.e. where  reaches either 0 or , which marks the point of a transition to d + g or d - g pairing respectively. In contrast, as a function of the isotropic strain gs, the evolution from the d+ig state to a pure g or pure d state involves a change of the relative amplitudes |D| and |G|, while the relative phase  = ±/2 remains constant.
· The lower two of Fig. (5b) represent the shear strain evolution under conditions in which at zero strain either the d or g component is absent. In both cases, the component that is dominant at zero strain remains dominant; indeed, its overall magnitude increases in much

the same way as in the top panel. As required by symmetry, the component that vanished in the absence of strain exhibits an initial linear increase in magnitude with increasing strain. However, in this case, the relative phase is a discontinuous function of strain; the groundstate always preserves TRS and jumps from being d + g to d - g as the sign of the strain changes.
We relate these results to the Ginzburg-Landau theory as follows: In the absence of strain, the system is tuned to the tri-critical condition 1  3  0 when d  g. Moreover, since the system exhibits d + ig order in this case, the requisite inequalities 1 > 0, 3 > 0 are automatically satisfied. The shear strain can be identified with 1  gd . Conversely, even relatively small values of |d -g|/|d +g| > 0.1 are enough to produce a sufficiently large value of 3 such that even at T = 0, || > /|0|. Also notice that we have taken relatively strong interactions; this condition becomes exponentially more restrictive the weaker the overall coupling, |d + g|. The extent to which the system needs to be "fine-tuned" near to the tetra-critical point is quantified as the narrowness of this coexistence phase in the zero-temperature phase diagram.
B. Domain Walls
We next address the domain wall behavior for a system near and away from the multi-critical point. To circumvent the difficulty of large coherence lengths at small interaction strength, we use large interaction strengths d = 3.2 and g = 4.9, chosen such that in the absence of strain, the uniform system is near the multi-critical point, i.e.., in a d + ig state. We then introduce an x-dependent shear strain with a domain wall along the y-axis, along which the system is translationally invariant. As a specific example, we take gd = 0.4 tanh(x/l) where l = 5 and |x|  L = 50. We take gs(x) to be constant.
Fig. (6) (top) shows the profiles of the order parameters and relative phase  as a function of x in the case gs = 0, i.e., near the multi-critical point.  twists through /2 passing through the domain wall, indicating the TRS is broken there. Fig. (6) (bottom) shows a TRS preserving domain wall for gs = 0.3, i.e., away from the multi-critical point.

FIG. 6. Domain Walls. The top panel shows the behavior of the SC order parameter across a domain wall at which the shear strain gd (x) changes sign when the system is detuned from the multi-critical point such that gs(x) = 0.3.The bottom panel shows the same sort of domain wall for a system near the multi-critical point so that gs(x) = 0. The spatial variation of gd , shown in the mini-plot, is of the form gd (x) = 0.4 tanh(x/l) where l = 5 and |x|  L = 50. The dashed lines represent the relative phase  with values given by the left y-axis, while the solid lines are the amplitudes of the D and G components with values given by the right y-axis.
leads to a half-quantum vortex, we consider the previous system on an infinite cylinder with periodic boundary conditions in the x-direction and translational invariance along the y-direction. The circumference of the cylinder (in the x-direction) is 400 sites. We then vary the microscopic terms [gs(x) and gd (x)] corresponding the evolution of 1 and 3 shown in Fig. (4). Solving the full SCF equations, we obtain D(x) and G(x) as shown in Fig. (7).
The results corroborate the expected behavior from the Ginzburg-Landau theory. Notice that the x-labels on top of Fig. (7a) indicate the expected state at each position along the contour. Most importantly, the relative phase  winds by 2 around the cylinder, from which it follows that  = . This result is translated into a trajectory on the Bloch sphere in Fig. (7b). Note that the trajectory of the order parameter is close to the e^1-e^3 plane, but deviates from it somewhat in parts of the trajectory, indicating that TRS is broken in certain regions along the path. Correspondingly, in this calculation, we expect the flux induced by the strain pattern to deviate slightly from 0/2 [see Eq. (11) and the discussion that follows].

IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have primarily explored the effect of inhomogeneous strain on the superconducting OP textures of a system tuned close to a tetra-critical point at which two different superconducting components have equal Tc's. Such a tetracritical point can arise due to symmetry - when in the absence of strain the two components form a two dimensional irreducible representation of the point group symmetries. However, we have primarily focused on the

10

case in which the tetracritical point arises from tuning a symmetry preserving parameter near to a critical value - a situation that might arise accidentally in a small subset of superconducting materials.
In this situation, even relatively small local strain can readily detune the system from the tetracritical condition sufficiently that a single component OP is locally favored. However, if on average the system is near enough to this critical value, it is also natural to find domain walls between regions of different dominant strain in which the system is approximately tetra-critical. This, in turn, can lead to TRS breaking on such domain walls, and thus to a state which globally breaks TRS but in which the symmetry breaking is locally significant only on a network of such domain walls. We have also shown that appropriate patterns of inhomogeneous strain can bind a half-quantum vortex.
These results may have interesting implications for a number of materials that show evidence for either an exact or a near-degeneracy of two SC orders, including UPt3 [21­23], URu2Si2 [24, 25], UTe2 [26], doped Bi2Se3 [27, 28], certain Fe based superconductors [29­31], and of course SRO. Most importantly, such a near degeneracy necessarily implies an enhanced sensitivity to variations in local strain, which can lead to a variety of otherwise unexpected behaviors. Note, however, that half quantum vortices and other topological defects can also arise as dynamical excitations in multi-component superconductors in the absence of any strain effects [32­36].
It is worth noting that while our results are quite general, they are obtained within mean-field theory, and neglect thermal fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter. These can lead to interesting effects close to the Tc in multi-component superconductors [37­40].
This study was undertaken with the SC state of SRO in mind. It is well established that the SC state is highly strain-sensitive. There are also a variety of experimental observations - ultra-sound anomalies key among them - that are most naturally consistent with an assumed near degeneracy between a d and g wave SC component. However, a variety of other experimental results appear, at first, difficult to reconcile with this scenario [2, 14, 17, 41]. The present results suggest a route to understanding some of these additional observations. This includes a suppressed thermodynamic signature of the TRS

breaking transition and the possibility of half quantum vortices, even though some aspects of the actual experiment [2] - for instance the dependence on an in-plane field - still need be addressed.
As mentioned in the introduction, a key issue concerns the strain-induced splitting between the SC and the TRS breaking transitions. It has been found that x2 - y2 (B1g) shear strain can produce a significant increase in Tc, with a small decrease in Ttrsb [15] - i.e. a split transition - while hydrostatic pressure (which produces A1g strain) can produce a pronounced depression of Tc but no detectable splitting of the transition [17]. These observations are trivially accounted for if one assumes that 3 has a strong (albeit quadratic) dependence on shear strain but only weakly dependent on isotropic strain while 0 depends on both components of the strain.
How stringent a condition this places on the isotropic strain dependence of 3 depends on the magnitude and character of the strain inhomogeneities - i.e. the width of the SC transition. To the extent that we can ignore the effect of xy (B2g) shear strain (i.e. for 1  0), it follows that so long as there are regions of d and regions of g wave SC, there must be domain walls between them at which TRS breaking can arise. Thus, a spilt transition will be apparent only when the mean value of 3 is greater than its variance.
The present considerations are encouraging in the sense that they illustrate a plausible explanation of a set of previously puzzling experiments in SRO. However, it is important to reiterate that this analysis sheds no insight of what is probably the most vexing aspect of the proposed scenario: why are these two symmetry distinct forms of SC order nearly degenerate with one another without need of any fine tuning?

A. Derivation of nonlinear sigma model

Therefore, we can write

Here, we review an efficient method of deriving the nonlinear sigma model in Eq. (3). Suppose that the OP  = (q) depends smoothly on parameter q. Then it's change (q)  (q +q) can be expressed as an infinitesimal rotation along with a change in the Berry phase , i.e.,

(q + q) = eiU (q)q(q)

Using the (anti-)commutation relations of the Pauli matrices, we can then efficiently derive the nonlinear sigma model, e.g.,

B. General ground state
Here, we present the exact solution of the ground state of the general Ginzburg-Landau free energy in the presence of a uniform strain vector . To provide a more intuitive picture of the general ground state, this section first treats the less restrictive case where 1 = 3 but 3 = 0. We then present the ground state in full generality.
It should be noted, however, that the uniform ground state does not depend on the kinetic terms K and thus we can always renormalize D, G so that 3 = 0.

1. 1 = 3 and 3 = 0

In the case where 1 = 3 are positive and 3 = 0, the potential term of the Ginzburg-Landau free
energy can be rewritten as

V2 = -||2(0 + 1n1 + 3n3)

(27)

||4(1

(28)

Where n^ is the Bloch vector corresponding to the
OP . It's then clear that the potential V is a strongly joint-convex function of ||2, ||2n3 and ||2n1. Therefore, convex optimization guarantees that the ground state of the uniform system is unique
and given by

||2 = 0,

ni

i i0

(29)

Provided that [n1]2 + [n3]2  1. Conversely, in the case where the above solution is not feasible, i.e., [n1]2 + [n3]2 > 1, the unique ground state is given by

||2

0 1-

(30)

||2ni

=

i i + 

(31)

Where   [0, 1) is chosen so that [n1]2 + [n3]2 = 1. In particular, the ground state corresponds to a Bloch vector n^ which is in the e^1-e^3 plane and thus does not break TRS.

2. Full generality: V is stable and superconducting

In full generality, we still require that the Ginzburg-Landau energy is stable, i.e., the potential term V   in the limit where ||  . This corresponds to the condition

43 - 32 > 0

(32)

Similarly, we are only concerned with nontrivial superconducting ground states, which corresponds to the condition

203 - 33 > 0

(33)

Therefore, our general ground state solution is subject to the 2 conditions above. The potential term of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy can be rewritten as

V2 = -||2(0 + 1n1 + 3n3)

(34)

V4

=

1 2

||4(1

(35)

By our stability condition (32), the potential term
V is a strongly joint-convex function in terms of ||2, ||2n1 and ||2n3. Therefore, convex optimization guarantees that the ground state of the
uniform system is unique and given by

We then calculate the domain wall energy F of

possible transition paths as illustrated by the blue

and green arrows in Fig. (2) where the magnitude

||2 of the OP  is assumed to be constant and

= 0. In particular, the blue arrow represents a TRS

preserving transition, while the green arrow denotes

a TRSB transition restricted to a 2D plane at angle

 with respect to the e^3-axis.

1. TRS preserving transition

We shall first consider a TRS preserving transition as described by the blue path in Fig. (2). Notice that we implicitly assumed that  < /2. If on the other hand,  > /2, then we would consider the complement path wrapping from underneath the Bloch sphere. Since the transition preserves TRS so that the Bloch vector is in the e^1-e^3 plane, we can restrict the azimuthal angle   0 for y  0 and    for y < 0. Therefore, we can rewrite the Ginzburg-Landau free energy in terms of polar angle  and average phase , i.e., if y  0 so that   0, then

F = V2 + V4 + K

2. TRSB transition

Let us now consider the special TRSB transition as described by the path with  = /2 in Fig. (2), so that the polar angle  of the Bloch vector n^ remains constants and =  < /2, while the azimuthal angle  twists   0. Therefore, we can rewrite the Ginzburg-Landau free energy in terms of azimuthal angle  and average phase , i.e., if y  0 so that 0    /2, then

F = V2 + V4 + K

(57)

V2 = -||2(0 + 1 sin  cos  + 3 cos ) (58)

is assumed to be in a plane at angle  with respect to the

e^1-e^3 plane. The bottom figure is the transition rotated

of angle  about the +x-axis in the clockwise direction.

3. General TRSB transition
Let us finally consider a general TRSB transition as described by the green path in Fig. (2). To simplify the problem, we will only consider general TRSB transitions which occur in a 2D plane as shown in Fig. (8), where the transition plane is at an arbitrary angle  with respect to the vertical plane. If  = 0, then the transition corresponds to the TRS preserving transition (blue arrow), and if  = /2,

16

then it corresponds to the special TRSB transition.

Since the Ginzburg-Landau free energy has a global

SU (2)-symmetry, we can rotate the system about

the +x-axis of angle  in the clockwise direction

so that the transition occurs in a plane parallel to

xy-plane and thus can be parametrized in terms of

azimuthal angle , while the polar angle  is held

fixed, as shown in Fig. (8). This corresponds to

using the rotated order parameter ~ = U  where

U  SU (2) corresponds to the described rotation R.

We then rewrite the Ginzburg-Landau free energy

so

D. Full self-consistent equations

In this section, we derive the full self-consistency field equations (SCFs) for the full Hamiltonian Hfull = H0 + H1 defined in Eq. (12), (13). Let us first write the corresponding BCS Hamiltonian H as

H=

T (r , r )cr scr s

r ,r ,s

r ,r

=

c

H^ =

(86) (87) (88)

To simplify notation, let us introduce the notation 1r = |r r | for the projection operator and the 1particle density matrices (1-pdms) [42] of the BCS Hamiltonian H, i.e.,

(r , r ) = cr cr  = cr cr  (r , r ) = cr cr  = - cr cr 

(89) (90)

The Hartree-Fock energy Hfull = H0 + H1 can then be computed via Wick's theorem so that

H0 = 2 tr(T )

H1 = -2

 tr 2f 1r f1r

 =d,g

r

(91) (92)

The self-consistency field equations (SCFs) can then be derived from extremizing the variational free energy F   Hfull - T SH = 0 and written in operator form

T =t-



(f 1r f1r + h.c.)

 =d,g r 

+1r ff 1r + f 1r 1r f

 (f 1r f1r + tr)

r

(93) (94)

Where tr implies the transpose term = 1r f1r f = 1r f1r f , and we used the fact that , f are symmetric, i.e., T = , fT = f . The proposed format of writing the SCFs in operator form has the advantage of working in any basis set, and in particular, we can work in real space |r or momentum space
|k . This will simplify our algebra later on. The corresponding BdG equations can similarly be written as

 = unEu + v¯(1 - nE)vT

(95)

(96)

where nE is the diagonal matrix with entries of the Fermi distribution nE = (eE + 1)-1 and u, v are
chosen so that the following unitary matrix W diagonalizes the first quantized Hamiltonian H^ , i.e.,

H^ = W

1. Uniform system in momentum space

The full SCFs can be further simplified in a uniform system, so that the 1-pdms ,  (89), hopping
matrix t and form factors f are diagonalized in kspace. In particular,

(k) = c c = c c

k k

k k

(k) = c-kck = - ckc-k

(100) (101)

In this case, the SCFs (93) are reduced to

T (k) = t(k) -

 f (k) f  + h.c) (102)

 =d,g

+ |f |2 + |f (k)|2 

(k) = -4

 f (k) f

 =d,g

(103)

Where we use the notation · · · as the average value summed over k-space, i.e.,

h=

(-,]2

d2k (2)2

h(k)

(104)

Notice that the specific form of our -function (102),
i.e., (k) = Dfd(k) + Gfg(k) for complex constants D, G implies that the SCFs indeed yield a twocomponent OP theory. Similarly, the BdG equations are reduced to

(k)

(105) (106)

Where n(k) = (eE(k) + 1)-1 is the Fermi distribution of the Bogoliubov quasi-particles with dispersion relation

E(k) = T (k)2 + |(k)|2

(107)

E.  · J = 0 in BCS theory

Let H[] denote the BCS Hamiltonian with parameters  = (, ). Let the particular choice of parameter  be such that H[] satisifes the full selfconsistency equations with respect to the full Hamiltonian Hfull, i.e.,

 

=

Hfull



=

1 

 

S[])
=

(108)

Where S[] is the von-Neumann entropy of H[] defined by S = - tr ( log ) where  is the Gibbs distribution of the BCS Hamiltonian H[], and · · ·  is the thermal average at temperature T with respect to the BCS Hamiltonian H[].

18

We shall subsequently show that at any temperature and every lattice site r , the charge density (r ) is constant in BCS theory, i.e.,

(r ) = 0 t t=0

(109)

As a corollary, we can apply the continuity equation t(r ) =  · J(r )  r J(r , r ) to obtain

 · J(r )  

J(r , r )  = 0

r 

(110)

Indeed, let us introduce the notation for gauge transformation at lattice site r , i.e., if M is an operator, e.g., the full Hamiltonian Hfull or the BCS Hamiltonian H[], then define

M (s) = eis(r )Ae-is(r ), s  R

(111)

In this case, notice that

H[](s) = H[(s)]

(112)

where (s) denote the parameters

T (r , r )(s) = T (r , r )eis((r ,r )-(r ,r )) (113) (r , r )(s) = (r , r )eis((r ,r )+(r ,r )) (114)

Also notice that the BCS partition function Z[(s)] is independent of s since the trace is invariant under unitary gauge transforms and thus

Hfull(s)
