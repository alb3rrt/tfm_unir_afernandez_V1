 -tilting theory ­ an introduction
Hipolito Treffinger
June 2, 2021
Abstract
The notion of  -tilting theory was introduced by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten at the beginning of the last decade and quickly became one of the most active areas of research in the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. The aim of these notes is two-fold. On the one hand, we want to give a friendly introduction to  -tilting theory to anyone with a small background in representation theory. On the other, we want to fill the apparent gap for a survey on the subject by collecting in one place many of the most important results in  -tilting theory.
1 Introduction
The term  -tilting theory was coined by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten in [4] at the beginning of the 2010's. In their paper, the authors created a fresh approach to the study of two classical branches of the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras, namely tilting theory and AuslanderReiten theory. The combination of these two subjects is clearly reflected in the name of this novel theory, where the greek letter  represents the Auslander-Reiten translation in the module category of an algebra while the reference to tilting theory is obvious.
Our primary aim with these notes1 is to give a friendly introduction to  -tilting theory from a representation theoretic perspective. Here you can find a compilation of many important results on the subject, giving a special emphasis in the close relation between  -tilting theory and torsion theories. Some background in representation theory and Auslander-Reiten theory is desirable but not necessary to follow this exposition. We note that given the immense amount of work that has been done in the last decade on  -tilting theory, this is not a complete survey on the topic. For instance, we do not cover the rich connections that  -tilting theory has with other branches of mathematics, such as combinatorics or algebraic geometry.
This article can be divided in five different parts. In the first part, that consists only of Section 2, we give a brief historic account of the events leading to the rise of  -tilting theory in representation theory. We note that this section is not necessary for the understanding of the rest of the paper and can be skipped. In the second, which goes from Section 3 to Section 4, we give the basic definitions of the theory. We also describe some of the different forms that  -tilting theory can adopt, namely support  -tilting modules,  -tilting pairs, functorially finite torsion classes. The third part, corresponding to Sections 5­10, is dedicated to compiling general results on the subject, including the so-called  -tilting reduction and the characterisation of  -tilting finite algebras.

K-theory of  -tilting theory and its relation with extriangulated categories is discussed in the fourth part of the paper, namely Sections 12, 13 and 14. We finish these notes in Section 15, where we show how we can associate to every algebra a geometric object known as its wall-and-chamber structure and we explain how this invariant encodes much of its  -tilting theory.
We warn the reader that we do not include in these notes any proofs, these can be found in the references given by each result. Given the short time that has passed since the introduction of
 -tilting theory, to our knowledge, there is not much material on the subject available other than the original research papers, with the exception of [63]. For background material in representation
theory, we recommend the textbooks [16, 23, 88]. For survey materials on more classical tilting
theory, the reader is encouraged to see [11, 6].

1.1 Notation

In these notes A is always a basic finite dimensional algebra over a field K that we assume is

algebraically closed. For us modA is the category of finitely presented right A-modules and 

denotes the Auslander-Reiten translation in modA.

Given any A-module M , we denote by |M | the number of isomorphism classes of indecomposable

direct summands of M . Throughout this document we assume that n is the number of isomorphism

classes of simple A-modules. Note that in this case |A| = n, since A = denotes the i-th indecomposable projective module.

n i=1

where

P (i)

Also, unless otherwise specified, every module is assumed to be basic, meaning that the inde-

composable direct summands of M are pairwise non-isomorphic.

2 Towards  -tilting theory
It can be argued that the modern study of representation theory started with the parallel developments of almost split sequences by Auslander and Reiten [18, 20, 21] (see also [84]) and the theory of quiver representations by Gabriel [51, 52]. Gabriel showed two very important results using quivers. One of these results says that the representation theory of every finite dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field can be understood using quiver representations. The formal statement is the following.
Theorem 2.1. [51] Let A be a finite dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field K. Then A is Morita equivalent to the algebra KQ/I, the path algebra of the quiver Q bounded by an adimissible ideal of relations I. Moreover the quiver Q is uniquely determined by A.

In the literature, people refer to the quiver Q determined by the algebra as the ordinary quiver or the Gabriel quiver or simply the quiver of the algebra. In these notes we take the latter option. The reason to give it such names is that one can associate to each finite dimensional algebra another quiver known as the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the algebra, which encodes all the almost split sequences in mod A. For more information about the Auslander-Reiten theory of algebras, the reader is encouraged to see the course on this topic by Raquel Coelho-Simões in this same series. See also [16, IV.5].
The second result of Gabriel we want to mention here is the classification of hereditary algebras of finite representation type by means of Dynkin diagrams as follows.
Theorem 2.2. [51] Let A be a connected hereditary representation-finite finite dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field K. Then A is Morita equivalent to K, where  is a quiver whose underlying graph is a Dynkin diagram of type A, D or E. Moreover there is a one-to-one correspondence between the indecomposable representations of A and the positive roots of the root system associated to .
When this result appeared, it came as a great surprise since many fundamental properties of the path algebra of a quiver depend on the orientations of the arrows. For instance, if we start with two quivers Q1, Q2 that correspond to two different orientations of the same Dynkin diagram  then the path algebra KQ1 is in general not isomorphic to the path algebra KQ2, not even as vector spaces. Hence, there was no reason to believe that the number of indecomposable representations should be the same.
Example 2.3. For instance, take the algebras A and A to be the path algebras of the quivers

QA = 1

of type A3. A quick calculation shows that dimK A = 6 while dimK A = 5. The AuslanderReiten quivers of A and A can be found in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively. Here the arrows correspond to the irreducible morphisms in the module category and the dashed lines correspond to the Auslander-Reiten translation. In these figures we can see that the number of indecomposable representations of A and A coincide.
As a consequence, explaining this phenomenon became of significant interest. The first explanation was given by Bernstein, Gelfand and Ponomarev in [30] by constructing the so-called reflection

functors.
Let Q a quiver of type  and denote by Q0 the set of vertices of Q. Since every Dynkin diagram is a tree, there is at least one vertex x  Q0 which is a sink, that is a vertex such that all the arrows incident to that vertex are incoming arrows. Now, we construct a quiver QA which is identical to QA, except for the fact that now the vertex x is a source, which means that every arrow incident to x is an outgoing arrow. One says that QA and QA are reflections of each other at x. In Example 2.3, Q is the reflection of Q at the vertex 3. Then, Bernstein, Gelfand and Ponomarev showed the
existence of functors, that they called reflection functors, between mod KQ and mod KQ that induce a one-to-one correspondence between their indecomposable objects.
Some years after that, Auslander, Platzeck and Reiten [19] realised that these functors were
induced by a very specific object in mod KQ. To be more precise, note that the simple module S(x) associated to the vertex x  Q0 is projective and it is not injective. This implies that the inverse Auslander-Reiten translation  -1S(x) of S(x) is a non-zero indecomposable object of mod KQ.
Then they showed that the reflection functors described by Berstein, Gelfand and Ponomarev were equivalent to HomA(T, -) : modA  modA, where T is the module

T =  -1S(x) 

P (y).

(1)

x=yQ0

Thus, T is the sum of all of the indecomposable projectives except S(x), direct sum  -1S(x).

Moreover, they showed that KQ is isomorphic to EndKQ(T )op. In particular, this approach allowed them to show the existence of reflection-like functors between the module category of any Artin

algebra A having a simple projective module and EndA(T ), even when A is not hereditary or even when A is not the quotient of the path algebra of a quiver. Going once again to our running

Some years later, Brenner and Butler went further and studied in [31] this phenomenon ax-

iomatically. In this paper they introduce the notion of tilting modules as follows.

Definition 2.4. [31] Let A be an algebra and T be an A-module. We say that T is a tilting module if the following holds:

(i) pdAT  1, the projective dimension of T is at most 1.

(ii) T is rigid, that is Ext1A(T, T ) = 0.
(iii) There exists a short exact sequence of the form
0  A  T   T   0
where T , T  are direct summands of direct sums of T .
In this paper they show that any tilting A-module T acts as a sort of translator between the representation theory of A and B := EndA(T )op, the opposite of the endomorphism algebra of T .
The first thing that they have shown is that a tilting A-module T is also a tilting B-module. Moreover they showed that T induced a torsion pair (T , F ) in modA and a torsion pair (X , Y) in modB such that the functors HomA(T, -) : modA  modB and Ext1A(T, -) : modA  modB induce equivalences of categories between T and Y and between F and X , respectively. This result of Brenner and Butler can be seen applied to our running example in Figure 3. For the precise definition of torsion pair, see Definition 4.1. Also, a more detailed treatment of the tilting theorem will be given in Section 5.
Since the module introduced by Auslander, Platzeck and Reiten was their motivating example, one can expect that it satisfies (i)-(iii) and indeed this is the case. In fact, nowadays this module

is known as the APR-tilting module. But, as the reader is already guessing, there are many more

examples of tilting modules.

Take the module T

One can verify that T

is indeed a

tilting module. Firstly, the projective dimension of T is less or equal to one since A is hereditary.

Secondly, one can check that T does not admit self extensions. Finally, the short exact sequence

Now, the algebra B = EndA(T ) is isomorphic to the path algebra of the quiver

modulo the ideal generated by the composition of the two arrows. The Auslander-Reiten quiver of

B can be seen in Figure 4.

As we can see in this example, when we take an arbitrary tilting module A the numbers of

indecomposable representations in modA and in modB are not the same. However, this is not a

contradiction of the results of Brenner and Butler since their result only says what happens inside

the torsion pairs induced by T in modA and modB. In this particular case, as we can see in

and

F induced by the tilting module T .

Although the categories modA and modEndA(T ) are not in general equivalent, it was shown by Happel [58], first, and then generalised by Rickard [85] that these two algebras are derived

equivalent. Without going into the details, starting from the module category of an algebra, one

can construct a triangulated category known as the derived category of the algebra that encodes a

wealth of homological information of the algebra. Then, the results of Happel and Rickard state

that, at a derived level, the original algebra and the endomorphism algebra of the tilting module

have the same derived category, which implies that they share many homological properties that

we will not discuss here. For more information about derived categories and their relationship with

cluster algebras, we refer the reader to the notes of Matthew Pressland in this series.

Let us do a small parenthesis here that will be important later. The algebra B is the smallest

non-hereditary example of the so-called tilted algebras. Tilted algebras were introduced by Happel

and Ringel in [59] as the endomorphism algebra of tilting modules over a hereditary algebras. The main idea behind their introduction was to use all the information available on hereditary algebras to understand a new class of algebras which had not been studied systematically until that moment.
The study of tilted algebras has sparked a great deal of research which it would be impossible to describe completely here. However, we need to mention two famous developments.
Firstly, note that the tilting theorem of Brenner and Butler does not impose any restriction on the algebra A. So, if we are able to understand some of the representation theory of tilted algebras using the knowledge we have on hereditary algebras, we can repeat the process and understand the representation theory of a new family of algebras using the knowledge we have on tilted algebras via the tilting theorem. These algebras are known as iterated tilted algebras. In [?], Assem and Skowroski classified all the iterated tilted algebras of Dynkin type A~ in terms of their ordinary quiver and relations, which led them to the definition of the so-called gentle algebras. Today, gentle algebras constitute a highly active area of research, deepening our understanding of representation theory of finite dimensional algebras and connecting this topic with various other branches of mathematics such as group theory and algebraic and differential geometry.
The second is the characterisation of tilted algebras found independently by Liu [69] and Skowroski [93] using the Auslander-Reiten quiver an algebra. They have shown that an algebra is tilted if and only if there is a structure with specific homological and combinatorial properties in their Auslander-Reiten quiver. Inspired by this characterisation of tilted algebras many families of algebras have been defined and determined by means of their Auslander-Reiten quivers.
Some years later, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, Fomin and Zelevinsky [47, 48, 29, 49] were studying the properties of the canonical bases arising in Lie theory and this study led to the introduction of cluster algebras.
These algebras are spanned by a basis of so-called cluster variables that are produced inductively from an initial seed via a process called mutation. Even if the process of mutation is repeated ad-infinitum, for some initial seeds there are only finitely many cluster variables that can be constructed. In this case we say that a cluster algebra is of finite type. Moreover, for some of these algebras, known as skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras, their combinatorial construction can be expressed using quivers. One surprising result shown by Fomin and Zelevinsky in the first of the series of papers where they introduced cluster algebras is the following classification.
Theorem 2.5. [48] Let (Q, {x}) be the initial seed of a cluster algebra A. Then A is of finite type if and only if Q is mutation equivalent to a quiver whose underlying graph is a Dynkin diagram.
The resemblance of this result with Theorem 2.2 is striking and points towards a deep relationship between cluster theory and representations of finite dimensional algebras.
Cluster variables are always arranged in sets called clusters which have exactly n variables. These clusters can be arranged into a n-regular graph where there is an edge between two clusters if one can be obtained from the other performing a single mutation.
As it turns out, similar phenomena have been described in tilting theory. For instance it was shown by Skowroski in [94] that every tilting module has exactly n isomorphism classes of indecomposable direct summands. Also, Happel and Unger have shown in [60] that every partial tilting module having n - 1 isomorphism classes of indecomposable direct summands can always be completed into a tilting module and that there are at most two ways in which this can be done.
Hence, one would like to categorify all the cluster phenomena using tilting theory, where the cluster variables are represented by indecomposable pretilting modules and tilting modules correspond to clusters. However, tilting theory falls short in describing the cluster phenomena for at

least two reasons. The first is that, as we just mentioned, there are some examples of almost com-

plete tilting modules that can be completed into a tilting module in exactly one way, which means

that we can not reproduce the process of mutation at some indecomposable direct summand of this

module.

The second reason, and maybe the most obvious, is that there are fewer indecomposable partial

tilting modules than cluster variables. For instance, a hereditary path algebra of type An has exactly

n(n-1) 2

partial

tilting

modules,

the

Then if one wants to categorify cluster algebras using tilting theory, it is necessary to extend the

latter in some way. That is exactly what Buan, Marsh, Reineke, Reiten and Todorov did in [35]. In

this seminal paper, instead of working with the module category of the algebra, they constructed a

slightly larger triangulated category that they called the cluster category where everything works

perfectly by the definition of the so-called (partial) cluster-tilting objects.

See in Figure 6 the cluster category associated to the algebra A of Example 2.3. The points

that are tagged with the same object in the Auslander-Reiten quiver of CA should be identified. In particular, we see that the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the cluster category of an algebra of type

A3 is a Möbius strip. In fact the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the cluster category of any algebra of type An is a Möbius strip.
One the one hand, they show that for any orientation of Dynkin quiver there is a one to one

correspondence between cluster variables and indecomposable partial cluster-tilting objects; that

there is a one to one correspondence between clusters and cluster-tilting objects; that the mutation

is well-defined in all the indecomposable direct summands of any cluster-tilting object; and that

the mutation of clusters and cluster-tilting objects are compatible. Note that these results were

later generalised to the general case [37, 39].

On the other, they showed that there is a natural inclusion of the module category of the path

algebra into the cluster category such that every (partial) tilting module in the module category

becomes a (partial) cluster-tilting object. Moreover, they show that every possible mutation of

tilting modules at the level of the module category becomes a mutation of cluster-tilting modules

at the level of the cluster category.

We said before that Happel and Ringel showed that much of the representation theory of tilted

9

algebras can be described from the information we have about the representation theory of the hereditary algebras. Now, the cluster categories associated to hereditary algebras have very nice properties, close to the properties of the hereditary algebras they come from. So Buan, Marsh and Reiten, emulating the construction of tilted algebras, introduced in [36] the cluster-tilted algebras as the endomorphism algebras of cluster-tilting objects in a cluster category. In this case, they showed that given a cluster-tilting object T in CA, the functor HomCA (T, -) induces a equivalence of categories between mod(EndCA(T ))op and the quotient of CA by the ideal I( T ) of all the morphisms that factor through  T the Auslander-Reiten translation of T .
We have mentioned already that the module category of any hereditary category A is naturally immersed in its cluster category CA. Moreover, if T is a tilting object in modA, it turns out that T becomes a cluster-tilting object in CA when we apply the natural embedding. Then starting from T we can construct a tilted algebra EndA(T ) and a cluster-tilted algebra EndCA(T ). The relation between EndA(T ) and EndCA(T ) and their module categories was studied by Assem, Brüstle and Schiffler in a series of papers [13, 12, 14, 15]. Firstly, they showed that one can recover EndCA(T ) from EndA(T ) via a process that they called relation extension which bypasses the cluster category CA. Moreover, they have shown that every cluster-tilted algebra is the relation extension of a tilted algebra. They also have characterised all the tilted algebras that have an isomorphic relation extension using particular structures that can be found in the Auslander-Reiten quivers of clustertilted algebras which are deeply related to the structures described by Liu and Skowroski for tilted algebras.
In order to start the construction of the cluster category, Buan, Marsh, Reineke, Reiten and Todorov assumed that the quiver in the initial seed of the algebra is acyclic. However, there is no reason why one should start with an acyclic quiver. From a cluster perspective, any quiver is equally valid, so it was expected for a similar cluster category to exist regardless of the quiver we choose at the start. The first problem with the more general quivers arising in cluster theory is that they have cycles, so their path algebras are infinite dimensional. Then in order to use something close to tilting theory, we need to form the quotient of this path algebra by the correct ideal of relations. This problem was solved by Derksen, Weyman and Zelevinsky [44, 45] when they build ideals arising from certain of potentials associated to a quiver. They have shown that associated to each quiver there exists a special potential, that they called non-degenerate, such that one can categorify the cluster algebra associated to the quiver using their decorated representations. Moreover, they went further and showed that there exists a notion of mutation of non-degenerate potentials that is compatible with the cluster mutations of the quivers. We note that the notion of decorated representation gives rise to a rich theory that is closely related to that of  -tilting theory and it can be considered as a precursor of the latter.
Now that we have the correct algebras associated to the cyclic quivers in cluster theory we would like to have their corresponding cluster categories. To build these categories is not obvious. The main problem being that the construction of Buan, Marsh, Reineke, Reiten and Todorov uses heavily the structure of the derived category of the algebra and some key properties used in their construction fail when the algebra is not hereditary. This problem was overcome by Amiot in [5], where she used the theory of Ginzburg dg-algebras developed by Keller and Yang in [67] to construct a cluster category which is compatible with the other notions of cluster categories existing to that moment.
All the phenomena of cluster algebras and the close parallelism with tilting theory pointed to the existence of another extension of classical tilting theory where we would be always allowed to perform mutations, this time without extending the module category. For hereditary algebras, the
10

construction of this theory was performed by Ingalls and Thomas in [62], where they introduced

the so-called support tilting modules. To explain the notion of support tilting module, let us come

back to the limitations of classical tilting theory.

As we did before consider A to be the path algebra of the linearly oriented A3 quiver. Then

T

a

module

in

modA.

Ideally, given any choice M of an indecomposable direct summand of T , we would like to

construct a new tilting module whose indecomposable direct summands other than M are the same

as those of T . In other words, we would like to replace each indecomposable direct summand of T

by another indecomposable in such a way that the resulting module is again tilting.

module. This is a consequence of a classical result obtained independently by Assem [10] and

Smalø [96], which implies that every indecomposable projective-injective object in modA is a direct

summand of any tilting module in modA.

In

particular,

which clearly is not tilting. However, it is tilting on its support algebra, which is constructed by

taking a quotient of A by the ideal generated by the idempotent included in the annihilator ann T 

of T .

More generally, they showed that for a hereditary algebra the mutation is always possible if we

allow our tilting modules not to be supported over every vertex of the algebra.

Now, for more general algebras this construction fails again. For instance, if we take the algebra

A to be the path algebra of the quiver

modulo the ideal generated by all paths of length 2, we have that A as a right module over itself is

isomorphic

to

Note

that

this

case

every

is

also

injective.

But

at the same time we cannot drop any of the direct summands since the sum of the two remaining

projective modules is supported on every vertex of the algebra.

Something that we have not said before is that, by construction, in the cluster category we have

that Ext1CA (M, N ) = HomCA (N,  M ).

This isomorphism can actually be translated to the module categories of non-hereditary cluster-

tilted algebras. So, we can translate the cluster-tilting objects of the cluster category to the module

category of a cluster-tilted algebra to get a series of modules which categorify perfectly the corre-

sponding cluster algebra. However, these objects are not in general partial tilting objects because

they might be of infinite projective dimension.

11

Then, Adachi, Iyama and Reiten introduced  -tilting theory in [4], the object of study of these
notes, by dropping the restriction on the projective dimension of the modules into consideration and replacing the classical rigidity with the notion of  -rigidity that we will introduce in the next
section.
Before starting with the material of the lectures notes, we would like to point out that many results of  -tilting theory were developed independently by Derksen and Fei in [43], where they
studied general presentations using methods of a more geometric nature.

3  -tilting theory: Basic definitions

In this section we give the basic definitions of  -tilting theory. We also mention some of the basic relations between  -tilting theory and classical tilting theory. We start by giving the central definitions of this note:  -rigid and (support)  -tilting modules.
Definition 3.1. [25, 24, 4] Let A be an algebra and M be an object in modA. We say that M is  -rigid if HomA(M,  M ) = 0.
Definition 3.2. [4] Let A be an algebra. A  -rigid A-module M is  -tilting if |M | = n. We say that a  -rigid A-module M is support  -tilting if there exists an idempotent e  A such that M is a  -tilting A/AeA-module, where AeA is the two-sided ideal generated by e in A.
At first glance,  -tilting and tilting modules have little to do with each other. If we compare Definition 2.4 with Definition 3.2, the only thing that a tilting and a  -tilting module have in common is that both are A-modules. However, there is a much deeper connection between the two concepts which follows from the so-called Auslander-Reiten formulas. Recall that D(-) := Homk(-, k) denotes the classical duality functor, IA(M, N ) is the vector space of maps from M to N that factor through the injectives A-modules and PA(M, N ) is the vector space of maps from M to N that factor through the projectives A-modules.
Theorem 3.3. Let A be an algebra and let M and N be two A-modules. Then there are funtorial isomorphisms

Ext1A(M, N ) = D

HomA(N,  M ) IA(N,  M )

= D

HomA( -N, M ) PA( -N, M )

.

A module M in modA is said to be rigid if Ext1A(M, M ) = 0. An immediate corollary of the Auslander-Reiten formulas is the following.

Corollary 3.4. Let M be an A-module. If M is  -rigid then M is rigid.
In fact this is the first of many other results relating tilting and  -tilting modules. In the following propositions we compile some properties relating the two notions.

Proposition 3.5. Let A be an algebra and T be a partial tilting module. Then T is  -rigid. Moreover, if T is tilting then |T | = n.
Proposition 3.6. [16] Let M be a  -rigid module. Then the following hold.
1. There are at most n isomorphism classes of indecomposable direct summands of M . In short, |M |  n.

12

2. If the annihilator ann(M ) of M is equal to the ideal {0}  A, then M is a partial tilting module.
3. If the projective dimension pdM of M is at most one, then M is a partial tilting module.
4. If |M | = n and ann(M ) = {0}, then M is a tilting module.
Proposition 3.7. Let A be an algebra. Then an A-module M is tilting if and only if M is  -tilting and faithful.
Proposition 3.8. Let A be an algebra. Then an A-module M is tilting if and only if M is  -tilting and pdM  1.
The last result can be presented as evidence to the statement that  -tilting theory is a generalisation of tilting theory which is independent of the projective dimension of the objects. Following this idea, in the last decade a series of works appeared generalising classical results in tilting theory to  -tilting theory. Some of these results will be stated in Section 5.
However, one needs to be careful when giving such statements, since some results on tilting theory do not hold in the context of  -tilting theory. Also, before the definition of  -tilting theory there was at least one other generalisation of tilting theory to higher projective dimensions. We are referring to the generalised tilting modules introduced by Miyashita in [72]. They are defined as follows.
Definition 3.9. [72] Let A be an algebra and T be an A-module and r be a positive integer. We say that T is a r-tilting module if the following holds:
(i) pdAT  r, the projective dimension of T is at most r.
(ii) ExtiA(T, T ) = 0 for all 1  i  r.
(iii) There exists a short exact sequence of the form
0  A  T (1)  T (2)  · · ·  T (r)  0
where T (i) is a direct summand of direct sum of copies of T for all 1  i  r.

We now give an example of all the support  -tilting modules in the module category of an algebra.

is

this

module support  -tilting or is it only  -rigid?

The meaning of this question is that M is only a support  -tilting module when we associate to

it the idempotent e3. However if we just write M does not allow us to see if M has an idempotent associated to it or not. Hence, it is better to include the idempotent in the notation since for certain

problems in  -tilting theory it is important to distinguish between these two cases. In order to do

that we need to recall the notion of  -rigid and  -tilting pairs. Before doing so, recall that given an

idempotent e  A we have that the right ideal eA is a projective module and that every projective

arises this way.

Definition 3.11. Let A be an algebra, M be an A-module and P be a projective module. We say that the pair (M, P ) is  -rigid if M is a  -rigid module and HomA(P, M ) = 0. A  -rigid pair is  -tilting if |M | + |P | = n.

As you would expect, these two notations are equivalent. Indeed, given a support  -tiling module M with associated idempotent e we have that (M, eA) is a  -tilting pair. Conversely, if (M, P ) is a  -tilting pair then we have that P = eA for some idempotent e  A. Then M is a support  -tilting module with associated idempotent e. The list of all  -tilting pairs of the algebra in Example 3.10 can be found in the third column of Table 1.

4  -tilting pairs and torsion classes
In this section, after recalling the definition of torsion pairs and their basic properties, we will investigate the deep relation existing between  -tilting theory and torsion classes.
4.1 Torsion pairs and torsion classes
The notion of torsion pairs, also known as torsion theories, started almost with the introduction of abelian categories as a generalisation of a well-known phenomenon in the category of finitely generated abelian groups, one of the most iconic examples of abelian categories.

Table 1: Support  -tilting modules and  -tilting pairs in modA

A classical classification result states that a finitely generated abelian group, up to isomorphism, has a unique torsion subgroup such that the resulting factor group is torsion-free. The extension of this fact to every abelian category was done by Dickson in [46] as follows.
Definition 4.1. [46] Let A be an abelian category and let (T , F ) be a pair of subcategories of A. We say that (T , F ) is a torsion pair in A if the following holds.
1. HomA(X, Y ) = 0 for all X  T and Y  F .
2. For all objects M  A there exists, up to isomorphism, a unique short exact sequence
0  tM  M  f M  0
such that tM is an object of T and f M is an object of F .
If (T , F ) is a torsion pair in A we say that T is a torsion class and F is a torsion-free class. Moreover, for each object M of A, we say that
0  tM  M  f M  0
is the canonical short exact sequence of M and that tM is the torsion object of M with respect to the torsion pair (T , F ).
The previous definition is valid for an arbitrary abelian category. However, in these notes we are interested in a particular class of abelian categories, namely the categories of finitely generated modules over a finite dimensional algebra. These categories have many extra properties (for example they are length categories) that allow us to describe the torsion pairs more precisely.
Proposition 4.2. Let A be an algebra. Then the following hold.

15

1. A subcategory T of modA is a torsion class if and only if T is closed under quotients and extensions. Moreover, in this case the torsion-free class associated to T is
F = {Y  modA : HomA(X, Y ) = 0 for all X  T }.
2. A subcategory F of modA is a torsion-free class if and only if F is closed under subobjects and extensions. Moreover, in this case the torsion-free class associated to F is
T := {X  modA : HomA(X, Y ) = 0 for all Y  F }.
Suppose that M is an A-module. Then we can ask the following: Is there a minimal torsion class in modA containing M ? The following result answers this question affirmatively.
Proposition 4.3. Let A be an algebra. Then the intersection of arbitrarily many torsion classes is a torsion class. Likewise, the intersection of arbitrarily many torsion-free classes is a torsion-free class.
Then, by the previous proposition, the minimal torsion class containing a given object M of modA is simply the intersection of all torsion classes containing M . Now, there is a more descriptive answer to this question, but to give that answer we need to introduce some notation.
Let X be a subcategory of modA. The category Filt(X ) of objects filtered by X is defined as the category of all the objects Y in modA that admit a filtration
0 = Y0  Y1  · · ·  Yr-1  Yr = Y
such that the successive quotients Yi/Yi-1 are objects in X . Note that Filt(X ) is the category of all the objects that can be constructed by making finitely many extensions by objects in X . In other words, Filt(X ) is the extension closure of X .
We define the category FacX as the category of objects Y such that there exists an object X in X and an epimorphism p : X  Y  0. Often in the notes, the category X we will be the additive category addM additively generated by a module M . In this case, by abuse of notation we will write FacM instead of Fac(addM ). Note that FacM can be described as
FacM = {Y  modA : there is an epimorphism p : M r  Y  0 for some r  N}.
Now we are able to give a better description of the minimal torsion class containing M .
Proposition 4.4. Let A be an algebra and M be an A-module. Then Filt(FacM ) is the minimal torsion class containing M .
Remark 4.5. Note that, in general, Fac(FiltM ) is not a torsion class since it might not be closed under extensions.
4.2 Functorially finite torsion pairs and  -tilting theory
From the previous subsection we have that to get the minimal torsion class containing M one needs to first calculate FacM and then take the extension closure of this category. However, sometimes FacM is already closed under extensions, which makes the second step of the construction superfluous.
The following theorem, originally proved by Auslander and Smalø in [24], is arguably the first result on  -tilting theory, even if this theory was formally introduced thirty years later.
16

Theorem 4.6. Let A be an algebra and M be an object in modA. Then FacM is a torsion class if and only if M is  -rigid, that is HomA(M,  M ) = 0. Moreover, in this case
M  := {X  modA : HomA(M, X) = 0}
is the torsion-free class such that (FacM, M ) is a torsion pair in modA.
As we just said, many years passed between the publication of this result and the start of  tilting theory as an independent subject in representation theory. However, this was not the only result that worked with  -rigid objects. In fact, a well-established technique used in classical tilting theory to determine if an object is tilting was to show that the candidate M was a  -rigid module such that pdM  1 and |M | = n. The interested reader is encouraged to surf the literature to look for such examples.
From a torsion theoretic point of view, the breakthrough made by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten in [4] is that they showed that  -tilting pairs characterised a particular class of torsion classes, the functorially finite torsion classes.
Let X be a subcategory of an abelian category A and suppose that X is an object of X and M is an arbitrary object of A. A morphism f : X  M in is called a right X -approximation of M if any map f  : X  M with X  X factors through f . Dually, a morphism g : M  X is called a left X -approximation of M if any map g : M  X with X  X factors through g. We say that X is contravariantly finite (resp. covariantly finite) if any object M in A admits a right (resp. left) X -approximation. We say that X is functorially finite if it is both contravariantly finite and covariantly finite.
An important consequence of the uniqueness up to isomorphism of the canonical exact sequence of an object with respect to a torsion pair is the following.
Proposition 4.7. Let (T , F ) be a torsion pair in an abelian category A and let M be an object of A. If
0  tM  M  f M  0
is the short exact sequence of M with respect to (T , F ) then the canonical inclusion i : tM  M is a right T -approximation and the canonical projection p : M  f M is a left F -approximation. In particular every torsion class in A is contravariantly finite and every torsion-free class F in A is covariantly finite.
Given a  -rigid module M , we know by Theorem 4.6 that FacM is a torsion class. In fact, it turns out that FacM is functorially finite, as shown by Auslander and Smalø in [?]. Before we give the precise statement of the theorem, we will introduce some notation that will be useful in the rest of the paper. Given a subcategory X of modA, we say that an object M in X is Ext-projective if Ext1A(M, X) = 0 for every object X in X . For every functorially finite torsion class T of modA we define P(T ) to be P(T ) := TA0  TA1 where fA : A  TA0 is the minimal left T -approximation of A as an object of modA and TA1 is the cokernel of fA.
Theorem 4.8. Let T be a functorially finite torsion class in modA. Then P(T ) is an Ext-projective object in T such that T  add(P(T )) for all Ext-projective module T in T . Moreover T = FacP(T ). In particular P(T ) is a  -rigid A-module.
This last result implies that every functorially finite torsion class is generated by a  -rigid module. This defines a well defined map  :  -rp-A  ftors-A from the set  -rp-A of all  -rigid
17

pairs to the set ftors-A of functorially finite torsion classes. The main contribution of [4] to this problem is the proof of the fact that this map is a bijection if we consider restrict  to the set  -tp-A   -rp-A of  -tilting pairs. The precise statement is the following. Theorem 4.9. [4] Let A be an algebra. Then the map  :  -tp-A  ftors-A defined by
(M, P ) = FacM
is a bijection. Moreover, the inverse -1 : ftors-A   -tp-A is defined as
-1(T ) = (P(T ), P T )
where p T is a basic additive generator of the category of projective modules P such that HomA(P, T ) = 0 for all T  T .
5 A ( -)tilting theorem
We have mentioned in Section 2 that the term tilting theory was coined by Brenner and Butler, who showed in [31] what is now known as the tilting theorem. In this section we give a precise statement of the tilting theorem. Afterwards we show how this result can be generalised to  -tilting theory and mention some of its limits.
5.1 A tilting theorem
We start by recalling the definition of a tilting module. Definition 5.1. [31] Let A be an algebra and T be an A-module. We say that T is a tilting module if the following holds:
(i) pdAT  1, the projective dimension of T is at most 1. (ii) T is rigid, that is Ext1A(T, T ) = 0. (iii) There exists a short exact sequence of the form
0  A  T   T   0
where T , T  are direct summands of direct sums of T . It follows from Proposition 3.5 that every tilting module T is  -tilting. Then we have that T has a torsion pair associated to it, namely (FacT, T ). Now, the torsion class FacT can be characterised homologically as follows. Proposition 5.2. Let T be a tilting module. Then FacM = X  modA : Ext1A(T, X) = 0 . Now, for every object M of modA we have that EndA(M ) is a finite dimensional algebra. In this case, M has a natural structure of a left EndA(M )-module structure. For the rest of the section we denote by B := EndA(T ) the endomorphism algebra of a tilting module T . The following proposition indicates the importance of tilting objects.
18

Proposition 5.3. [31] Let T be a tilting A-module. Then T is tilting as a left B-module. Moreover, T induces a torsion pair (X (T ), Y(T )) in the category modB of right B-modules where
X (T ) := {X  modB : X B T = 0}
Y(T ) := {Y  modB : TorB1 (Y, T ) = 0} We are now able to state the tilting theorem of Brenner and Butler.
Theorem 5.4. [31] Let A be an algebra, T be a tilting A-module and B = EndA(T ). Then the following hold.
1. The algebra EndoBp(T ) is isomorphic to A.
2. The functor HomA(T, -) : FacT  Y(T ) is an equivalence of categories with quasi-inverse - B T : Y(T )  FacT .
3. The functor Ext1A(T, -) : T   X (T ) is an equivalence of categories with quasi-inverse TorB1 (-, T ) : X (T )  T .
5.2 A  -tilting theorem
We have said in various opportunities that  -tilting theory can be seen as a generalisation of tilting theory. Hence, one would expect the existence of a generalisation of the tilting theorem to  -tilting theory. This was achieved in [98] building on the results of [64] that we discuss in the next section. Before stating the result, we need to recall some basic facts. The first key observation is that if A and C are algebras such that C is a quotient of A, then modC is a full subcategory of modA. This implies immediately that EndA(M ) = EndC (M ) for every C-module M .
In this section, we fix a  -tilting module T , we denote by ann T the annihilator of T and by C := A/ ann T the quotient algebra of A by ann T .
Proposition 5.5. If T is a  -tilting A-module, then T is a tilting C-module.
As a consequence of this proposition and Theorem 5.1 we have the existence of a torsion pair ((FacT )C, (T )C ) in modC and a torsion pair (X (T ), Y(T )) in modB and equivalences of categories between them. Now, we would like to compare the torsion pair ((FacT )A, (T )A) induced by T in modA with (X (T ), Y(T )) in modB. The main ingredient to do that comes from the following two results.
Proposition 5.6. [4] Let T be a  -tilting module. Then T  = Sub( T ).
Proposition 5.7. Let C be a quotient algebra of A and let M be a C-module. Then the AuslanderReiten translation C M of M in modC is a submodule of the Auslander-Reiten translation AM of M in modA.
Hence, if T is a  -tilting A-module we have that the torsion pair (FacT, T ) in modA coincides with the torsion pair (FacT, T ) in modC if and only if AM = C M . Then a  -tilting version of the tilting theorem of Brenner and Butler reads as follows.
Theorem 5.8. [98] Let A be an algebra, T be a  -tilting A-module, B = EndA(T ) and C = A/ ann T . Then the following hold.
19

1. The algebra EndoBp(T ) is isomorphic to C.

2. The functors HomA(T, -) : FacT  Y(T ) is an equivalence of categories with quasi-inverse - B T : Y(T )  FacT .

Remark 5.9. We note that there examples of  -tilting pairs such that AT = C T , such as the so-called  -slices introduced in [98].
We also note that there is another generalisation of the tilting theorem of Brenner and Butler for 2-term silting objects proved by Buan and Zhou in [38].

6  -tilting reduction
In the last section we explained the deep relationship between  -tilting pairs and torsion pairs. In this section we will consider the problem of completing a  -rigid pair, which we consider in two steps. In the first subsection we will show that there are two torsion pairs which are naturally associated to every  -rigid pair. In the second subsection we give a characterisation of all the completions of a  -rigid pair developed in [64]. We finish this section by mentioning some bijections between the torsion classes of different categories.
6.1 The Bongartz completion of a  -rigid pair
The choice of taking  -rigid modules to develop  -tilting theory is arbitrary. In fact, using  -1-rigid modules, that is, modules N such that HomA( -1N, N ) = 0, we can develop a completely dual  -1-tilting theory. See [4]. In this case, dual of Theorem 4.6 reads as follows.
Theorem 6.1. [24] Let A be an algebra and N be an object in modA. Then the category
SubN := {Y  modA : there is an monomorphismi : 0  Y  N r for some r  N}
is a torsion-free class if and only in N is  -1-rigid. Moreover, in this case
N := {X  modA : HomA(X, N ) = 0}
is the torsion class such that (N, SubN ) is a torsion pair in modA.
Now, take a non-projective  -rigid module M . Then it is easy to see that  M is  -1-rigid. Indeed,
HomA( -1 M,  M ) = HomA(M,  M ) = 0. Hence there are two torsion classes naturally associated to M , namely FacM and  M . In the following theorem we give some results regarding the relation between these two torsion classes and M , all of which appeared already in [4].
Theorem 6.2. [4] Let A be an algebra and M be a  -rigid A-module. Then the following holds.
1. FacM   M .

20

2. The torsion classes FacM and  M coincide if and only if M is  -tilting.
3. Suppose that T is a functorially finite torsion class. Then M is a direct summand of P(T ) if and only if FacM  T   M .
From the previous theorem we have that  M is the maximal torsion class having M as an Ext-projective, which makes the  -tilting module P( M ) special enough to have a name. We say that P( M ) is the Bongartz completion of M . This name was chosen because P( M ) plays an analogous role in  -tilting theory to that of the Bongartz completion in the classical tilting theory. To be more precise, Bongartz showed in [?] that if T is a partial tilting module, then P( T ) is a tilting module having T as a direct summand. In other words, Bongartz showed that every partial tilting module can be completed to a tilting module.
If we use the language of  -rigid pairs instead of  -rigid modules we can be more precise in our statements. From now on, by abuse of notation, we say that a  -rigid pair (M, P ) is a direct summand of (M , P ) if M is a direct summand of M and P is a direct summand of P .
Theorem 6.3. [4] Let A be an algebra and (M, P ) be a  -rigid pair in modA. Then the following hold.
1.  M  P  is a torsion class and FacM   M  P .
2. The torsion classes M  and  M  P  coincide if and only if (M, P ) is a  -tilting pair.
3. Suppose that T is a functorially finite torsion class. Then (M, P ) is a direct summand of -1(T ) if and only if FacM  T   M  P .
As for  -rigid modules, we say that -1( M  P ) is the Bongartz completion of (M, P ). But now we can also compute the  -tilting pair -1(FacM ) which is the  -tilting pair generating the smallest torsion class containing M . In this case, we say that -1(FacM ) is the Bongartz cocompletion of (M, P ).
6.2  -tilting reduction and torsion classes
In this subsection we consider the problem of finding all  -tilting pairs having a given  -rigid pair (M, P ) as a direct summand. This problem was solved by Jasso in [64] using a procedure that is now known as  -tilting reduction. Here we give a brief summary of that process.
By Theorem 6.3 one knows that (M, P ) yields the torsion classes FacM and ( M )  P . Moreover, Theorem 6.3 states the existence of a  -tilting pair of the form (M  M , P ) such that Fac(M  M ) = ( M )  P .
Now define B(M,P ) = EndA(M  M ) to be the endomorphism algebra of M  M . In the algebra B(M,P ) = EndA(M  M ), there is an idempotent element e(M,P ) associated to the B(M,P )projective module HomA(M  M , M ). We define the algebra C(M,P ) as the quotient of B(M,P ) by the ideal generated by e(M,P ), that is,
C(M,P ) := B(M,P )/B(M,P )e(M,P )B(M,P ).
Now we are able to state one of the main results of [64].
21

Theorem 6.4. [64] Let (M, P ) be a  -rigid pair in modA. Then the functor
HomA(M  M , -) : modA  modB(M,P )
induces an equivalence of categories
F : M    M  P   modC(M,P )
between the perpendicular category M   M P  of (M, P ) and the module category modC(M,P ).
As a direct consequence of Theorem 6.4 and Theorem 6.3 we obtain the following result.
Theorem 6.5. [64] Let (M, P ) be a  -rigid pair in modA and C(M,P ) as above. Then the the functor
HomA(M  M , -) : modA  modB(M,P )
induces a bijection between the torsion classes T in modA such that FacM  T   M  P  and the torsion classes in modC(M,P ).
In particular the functor
HomA(M  M , -) : modA  modB(M,P )
induces a bijection between the  -tilting pairs in modA having (M, P ) as a direct summand and the  -tilting pairs in modC(M,P ).
Remark 6.6. Note that Theorem 6.5 does not give a specific number of completions of a given  -rigid pair (M, P ). This is due to the fact that the number of  -tilting pairs in two algebras might differ hugely.
6.3 Bijections of torsion classes
Note that the perpendicular category M    M  P  defined by Jasso is a the intersection of the torsion class  M  P  with the torsion-free class M . Moreover, in this case M    M  P  is what is called a wide subcategory of modA. A subcategory X is called wide when it is closed under kernels, cokernels and extensions. In particular, this implies that X is an abelian category. Then Asai and Pfeiffer found in [9] the following generalisation of Theorem 6.5.
Theorem 6.7. [9] Let (T1, F1) and (T2, F2) be two torsion pairs in modA such that T1  T2. Suppose moreover that T2  F1 is a wide subcategory of modA. Then there is a bijection between the torsion classes T in modA such that T1  T  T2 and the torsion classes in T2  F1 given by map T  T  T1.
Note that, the intersection of a torsion class with a torsion-free class is not always a wide subcategory. However, it does always have some structure, namely that of a quasi-abelian subcategory [97]. The definition of quasi-abelian subcategories is a bit technical and it will be skipped.
However, it is worth mentioning that Tattar showed in [97] that there is a well-defined notion of torsion classes in quasi-abelian subcategories. Moreover he showed that Theorem 6.5 can be generalised to this setting as follows.
Theorem 6.8. [97] Let (T1, F1) and (T2, F2) be two torsion pairs in modA such that T1  T2. Then there is a bijection between the torsion classes T in modA such that T1  T  T2 and the torsion classes in T2  F1 given by map T  T  T1.
22

7 Torsion classes, wide subcategories and semibricks
We have seen already a bijection between  -tilting pairs and functorially finite torsion classes. In this section we will see the relation of  -tilting theory with two other notions, namely wide subcategories and semibricks, which were described by Marks and Stovicek [70] and Asai [7], respectively.
7.1 Torsion classes and wide subcategories
We start this subsection by recalling the definition of wide subcategories2.
Definition 7.1. A subcategory W of modA is said to be wide if it is closed under extensions, kernels and cokernels.
The idea of this section is to describe maps between the set tors-A of torsion classes in modA and set wide-A of wide subcategories in modA. Going from wide-A to tors-A, the map that we take is quite natural. Indeed we define
T (-) : wide-A  tors-A
where T (W) is the minimal torsion class in modA containing W. We recall from Proposition 4.4 that T (W) = Filt(FacW). Actually this map has a really nice property.
Proposition 7.2. [70] The map T (-) : wide-A  tors-A is injective.
On the other direction we need to build a map (-) : tors-A  wide-A. Given a torsion class T we define the subcategory (T ) of modA as follows.
(T ) := {X  T : kerf  T for all f  HomA(Y, X) with Y  T }
Proposition 7.3. [70] Let T be a torsion class in modA. Then (T ) is a wide subcategory of modA.
Inside tors-A there is the subset ftors-A of functorially finite torsion classes, that we have already discussed before. Likewise, inside wide-A there we have the subset of fwide-A of wide subcategories W of modA such that which are both of functorially finite and T (W ) is a functorially finite torsion class. The following theorem indicates what happens if we restrict the maps (-) and T (-) to these distinguished subsets.
Theorem 7.4. [70] The map T (-) : fwide-A  ftors-A is a bijection between the set fwide-A and ftors-A with inverse (-) : ftors-A  fwide-A.
As an immediate consequence of the previous theorem and Theorem 4.9 we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 7.5. For every algebra A there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set  -tp-A of  -tilting pairs and the set fwide-A of functorially finite wide subcategories of modA.
2We give here the definition of wide subcategories as usually known in the context of representation theory of algebras. We warn the reader that in algebraic topology the same terminology has a different meaning.

7.2 Semibricks
Let us recall the classical notion of bricks and the more novel notion of semibricks introduced by Asai in [7].
Definition 7.6. We say that an object M in modA is a brick if its endomorphism algebra EndA(M ) is a division ring. A set {S1, . . . , St} of bricks in modA is said to be a semibrick if HomA(Si, Sj) = 0 if i is different from j.
The classical example of a semibrick is the set {S(1), . . . , S(n)} of non-isomorphic simple A modules. Indeed, the classical Schur's lemma implies that {S(1), . . . , S(n)} is a semibrick. In fact, this is a particular case of a more general phenomenon. Recall that an object M in a subcategory X of modA is said to be relative simple if the only submodules of M that are in X are 0 and M .
Let W be a wide subcategory of modA and let S be a relative simple object in W. Then it is easy to see that S is necessarily a brick. Indeed, if f  EndA(S) then imf is a subobject of S which is in W because W is wide. Hence f is either the zero morphism or an isomorphism. A similar argument shows that the set

S(W) = {S : S is relative simple in W}.

is a semibrick. On the other hand, one can see that given a semibrick S the category Filt(S) is wide. In the following result sbrick-A denotes the set of all semibricks in modA.

Theorem 7.7. [7] The map

S(-) : wide-A  sbrick-A

is a bijection with inverse

Filt(-) : sbrick-A  wide-A.

Inside of sbrick-A there are semibricks S such that the minimal torsion class T (S) containing S is functorially finite. We denote the set of all such semibricks by fsbrick-A. Combining the last theorem with the results of the previous subsection we obtain the following.

Theorem 7.8. There are bijections between the sets  -tp-A, ftors-A, fwide-A and fsbrick-A.
There are several things that are worth mentioning here. Firstly, the bijections established in Theorem 7.8 are a very small subset of the existing bijections of interesting representation theoretic objects. A very nice paper that covered many of these bijections is the survey article [34] by Brüstle and Yang. We choose to mention these here (and we will mention some other bijections later) because they were shown after the latest update of [34] and are not included there.
We also want to emphasise that in the development of  -tilting theory a choice was made of working with the Auslander-Reiten translation  and torsion classes in modA, instead of working with the inverse Auslander-Reiten translation  - and torsion free classes. However, the corresponding dual statements for these results hold. In particular this adds many more bijections to this theory.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that Asai showed in [7] an explicit bijection between fsbricks-A and  -tp-A. This result was later recover in [100] using the notions of c-vectors that will be discussed in a later section.

8 The poset tors-A
The set tors-A of all torsion classes in modA has a natural poset structure, where the order is given by inclusion. In other words, given a pair of torsion classes T and T  we say that T  T  if T  T . In this section we show some of the basic properties of this poset.

8.1 tors-A is a complete lattice
The aim of this subsection is to explain its title. In order to do that we need to recall the definitions of a lattice and a complete lattice.
Definition 8.1. A poset P is a lattice if any two elements x, y  P admit a greatest common lower bound x  y, known as the meet of x and y, and a least common upper bound x  y, known as the join of x and y. A lattice P is said to be complete if every subset S of P admits a join and a meet.
There has been a lot of work studying the lattice theoretic properties of the set tors-A for an algebra A. One of the most important results in this direction was obtain by Demonet, Iyama, Reading, Reiten and Thomas in [42].
Theorem 8.2. [42] The set tors-A is a complete lattice for every algebra A. In this case, given a subset S  tors-A the meet and the join of S are defined as follows.

T := T

T S

T S

T := T

T

T S

T S

Remark 8.3. We note that the union of torsion classes is not always a torsion class since in general this union is not closed under extensions or quotients. That is why we need to consider the minimal
torsion class containing the union.

Now, suppose that C is a quotient algebra of A. The following theorem tells us how tors-A and tors-C are related.

Theorem 8.4. If A is an algebra and C is a quotient of A, then there is an epimorphism of lattices p : tors-A  tors-C. In other words, the lattice tors-C is a quotient of the lattice tors-A.

One of the main ingredients of the proof of this theorem is the so-called brick labelling that we will discuss in the next subsection.

8.2 The Hasse quiver of tors-A
We now shift the focus of our attention to the Hasse diagram of tors-A. In order to do that, let us recall the notion of the Hasse quiver of a poset.
Definition 8.5. Given a poset P, the Hasse quiver H(P) of P is an oriented graph whose vertices correspond to the elements of P and there is an arrow x  y if y  x such that y  z  x implies that x = z or y = z.

25

In particular the arrows of the Hasse quiver H(tors-A) of tors-A correspond to the maximally included torsion classes. That is, for two torsion classes T and T  we say that T is maximally included in T  if T  T  and T  T   T  implies that T  = T or T  = T . It turns out that maximal inclusions of torsion classes have a very nice characterisation, as shown by Barnard, Carrol and Zhu in [26].
Theorem 8.6. [26] Let T and T  be two torsion classes such that T is maximally included in T . Then there exists a brick S in modA such that T  = Filt(T  {S}). In this case, we say that S is the minimal extending module of the inclusion T  T .
A direct consequence of this result is the following corollary, that it is usually known as the brick labelling of H(tors-A).
Corollary 8.7. There is a well-defined labelling of the arrows of H(tors-A) by bricks in modA, where we label each arrow T   T of H(tors-A) with the minimal extending module corresponding to the inclusion T  T .
Remark 8.8. We note that brick labelling of H(tors-A) (or parts of it) can also be deduced as a consequence of several independent works that appeared simultaneously, namely [7, 33, 42, 100].
We have that the set of functorially finite torsion classes ftors-A is a subset of tors-A. So the question is how their Hasse quivers H(ftors-A) and H(tors-A), respectively, are related. In order to do that we need to know what happens when we have a maximal inclusion of torsion classes T  T  such that either T or T  are functorially finite. A complete answer to this question is a consequence of the works of Demonet, Iyama and Jasso [41].
Theorem 8.9. [41] Let T  T  be a minimal inclusion of torsion classes in tors-A. Then T is functorially finite if and only if T  is functorially finite.
Corollary 8.10. The Hasse quiver H(ftors-A) of ftors-A and the Hasse quiver H(tors-A) of tors-A are locally isomorphic.
9 Mutations of  -tilting pairs and maximal green sequences
As we said in in the introduction of these notes,  -tilting theory was conceived with the goal of completing the classical tilting theory with respect to mutation. In this section we start by discussing the notion of mutation from a torsion theoretic perspective. We finish it by speaking about the notion of maximal green sequences.
9.1 Mutations of  -tilting pairs
In order to speak about mutation we need to introduce a bit of notation.
Definition 9.1. We say that a  -rigid pair (M, P ) is almost complete if |M | + |P | = n - 1. Given two  -tilting pairs (M1, P1) and (M2, P2), we say that (M1, P1) is a mutation of (M2, P2) if there is an almost complete  -rigid pair (M, P ) which is a direct summand of (M1, P1) and (M2, P2). By abuse of notation we also say that FacM1 is a mutation of FacM2 if (M1, P1) is a mutation of (M2, P2).
26

The main result about mutation of  -tilting pairs is the following theorem shown by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten in [4], that can be considered the most important result in  -tilting theory.

Theorem 9.2. [4] Let (M, P ) be a  -tilting pair where M =

k i=1

Mi

and

P

=

n j=k+1

Pj

are

basic

modules. Then for every indecomposable direct summand Ml of M the almost complete  -rigid pair

( i=l Mi, P ) can be completed to a  -tilting pair different from (M, P ) in a unique way. Likewise,

for every indecomposable direct summand Pl of P the almost complete  -rigid pair (M, j=l Pj )

can be completed to a  -tilting pair different from (M, P ) in a unique way.

Remark 9.3. We note that we can recover Theorem 9.2 as a consequence of Theorem 6.5. Indeed,

one can verify that for all almost complete  -rigid pair (M, P ) the algebra C(M,P ) is local, which

implies that there is only one isomorphism class of simple modules in modC(M,P ). As a consequence

of this, if S isomorphic

is to

a simple 0.

module

in

modC(M,P )

we

have

that

HomC(M,P ) (X, S)

=

0

implies

that

X

is

Let S be a simple module in modC(M,P ) and T be a torsion class. Then we have two options: either S  T or S  T . If S  T , then X  T for all X  modC(M,P ) since torsion classes are closed under extensions. Otherwise, we have that T = {0} by the argument above.

This shows that every local algebra, no matter how complicated its representation theory, has

exactly two torsion classes in its module category, which are the trivial torsion classes. In particular,

this implies that there are exactly two  -tilting pairs in modC(M,P ) if (M, P ) is an almost complete  -rigid pair. Hence Theorem 9.2 follows from Theorem 6.5.

Another important consequence of the previous argument is the following.

Proposition 9.4. [4] Let (M1, P1) and (M2, P2) be two  -tilting pairs that are mutation of each other and let (M, P ) be the almost complete  -rigid pair which is a direct summand of both. Then either FacM1  FacM2 or FacM2  FacM1. In particular, FacM1 = FacM2. Moreover, if FacM1  FacM2 then FacM1 = FacM and FacM2 =  M  P .
Remark 9.5. From Theorem 9.2 it follows that given a  -tilting pair (M, P ) and a choice (M1 , P1) of an indecomposable direct summand of (M, P ) there is a unique  -tilting pair (M1, P1) which is the mutation of (M, P ) at (M1 , P1). In this case we say that (M1, P1) is the mutation of (M, P ) at (M1 , P1).
Moreover, if (M1 , P1) and (M2 , P2) are distinct indecomposable direct summands of (M, P ), then the mutations (M1, P1) and (M2, P2) of (M, P ) at (M1 , P1) and (M1 , P1), respectively, are different. In particular, this implies that for every  -tilting pair (M, P ) there are exactly n  -tilting pairs which are a mutation of (M, P ).
In fact, there are explicit homological formulas to construct (M1, P1) from (M2, P2) and back but we will not explicit them here. The interested reader is encouraged to see [4] for more details on the matter.
We now state a result by Demonet, Iyama and Jasso showing how the mutation of  -tilting pairs can be seen at the level of torsion theories.

Theorem 9.6. [41] Let A be an algebra (M, P ) be a  -tilting pair and T be a torsion class in modA. Then the following hold.

1. If T FacM then there exists a mutation (M , P ) such that T  FacM  FacM .

2. If FacM T then there exists a mutation (M , P ) such that FacM FacM   T .

27

Using the notion of mutation of  -tilting pairs, one can construct a graph  -tp-A where the vertices are the  -tilting pairs in modA and there is an edge between two  -tilting pairs if and only if they are mutation from each other. Using the results of this section we can prove the following result.
Proposition 9.7. The graph  -tp-A is isomorphic to the undirected graph underlying H(ftors-A). In particular, H(ftors-A) is an n-regular quiver.
9.2 Maximal green sequences
In the module category of any algebra A there are always at least two torsion classes, sometimes called the trivial torsion classes, which are the whole of modA and the torsion class {0} containing only the objects that are isomorphic to the 0 object. Both of these torsion classes are functorially finite and it is not hard to see that (A, 0) = modA and (0, A) = {0}.
Clearly {0} modA. So we can apply Theorem 9.6.1 and obtain a  -tilting pair (M1, P1) which is a mutation of (A, 0) such that {0}  FacM1 modA. If FacM1 is not equal to {0} we can repeat the process to obtain a mutation (M2, P2) of (M1, P1) such that {0}  FacM2 FacM1 modA. We can repeat this process inductively to obtain a decreasing chain of torsion classes
{0}  · · · FacM3 FacM2 FacM1 modA
which in general can continue forever. However, in some cases this process stops. This leads to the following definition.
Definition 9.8. A maximal green sequence of length t in modA is a finite set of  -tilting pairs {(Mi, Pi) : 0  i  t} such that (M0, P0) = (A, 0), (Mt, Pt) = (0, A) and (Mi, Pi) is a mutation of (Mi-1, Pi-1) and FacMi  FacMi-1. Equivalently, a maximal green sequence is a finite chain of torsion classes
{0} = T0 T1 · · · Tt-1 Tt = modA such that Ti-1 is maximally included in Ti for all 1  i  t.
Maximal green sequences were originally introduced by Keller in [65] in the context of cluster algebras to give a combinatorial method to calculate certain geometric invariants known as Donaldson-Thomas invariants. The definition given here can be considered as a generalisation to the setting of  -tilting theory of the original definition, since there are many examples of algebras which do not have a cluster counterpart.
We have preciously discussed in Section 7 that given a maximal inclusion T  T  of torsion classes T , T  there is a brick B in modA such that T  = Filt(T  {B}). Then, applying this argument inductively we can see that if we have a maximal green sequence
{0} = T0 T1 · · · Tt-1 Tt = modA
we have a set of bricks B = {B1, B2, . . . , Bt} such that modA = Filt(B). As it is, this is not a significant result since a small argument shows that all simple modules belong to B regardless of our starting maximal green sequence, and we know that simple modules filter every objet in modA. However, one can show that the filtrations given in this way are unique in the following sense.
28

Theorem 9.9. Let {0} = T0 T1 · · · Tt-1 Tt = modA be a maximal green sequence in modA and let B = {B1, B2, . . . , Bt} be the set of bricks associated to it. Then for every non-zero object M of modA there is a filtration
0 = M0  M1  · · ·  Ms-1  Ms = M
such that s  t, Mj/Mj-1  Filt(Bji ) and j1 < j2 < · · · < js-1 < js. Moreover, this filtration is unique up-to-isomorphism.
Remark 9.10. The previous result is a consequence of two works that appeared independently, namely [66] and [99]. In the appendix of [66], Demonet showed that the set B is what he calls a I-chain and showed that every I-chain induces a unique filtration in every object of modA.
A more general approach to this problem was given in [99], where it was shown that every chain of torsion classes induces a unique filtration for every object in modA. In that paper, this filtration was called the Harder-Narasimhan filtration induced by the chain of torsion classes since it generalises the Harder-Narasimhan filtrations induced by stability conditions. Remark 9.11. Note that the word green in the name maximal green sequence does not make reference to any mathematician of name Green. Instead this word makes reference to the classical colouring in traffic lights. The reason for this is that in cluster algebras there is no evident reason to say that a mutation is going forward or backwards. However, Keller needed to impose such a direction to mutations in order to get the desired calculation. Then, he came up with a colouring of the vertices of the quiver associated to the cluster algebra in which a vertex is either green or red, which indicates if we are allowed to mutate at the given vertex or not, respectively. In this colouring, every vertex in the quiver of the initial seed is green and we are allowed to mutate at one green vertex at a time. The process finishes if after a finite number of mutations all the vertices in the quiver are red. To learn more about this rich subject, see [66].
10  -tilting finite algebras
To finish this part of the notes we speak about a new class of algebras that originated with the study of  -tilting theory, the so-called  -tilting finite algebras. They were introduced by Demonet, Iyama and Jasso as follows.
Definition 10.1. [41] An algebra A is  -tilting finite if there are only finitely many  -tilting pairs in modA.
Even though the class of  -tilting finite algebras has been recently introduced, they have received a lot of attention. In the following theorem we compile a series of characterisations of  -tilting finite algebras.
Theorem 10.2. Let A be an algebra. Then the following are equivalent.
1. A is  -tilting finite.
2. There are finitely many indecomposable  -rigid objects in modA.
3. [41] There are finitely many torsion classes in modA.
4. [42] There are finitely many bricks in modA.
29

5. [90] The lengths of bricks in modA is bounded.
6. [7] There are finitely many semibricks in modA.
7. [70] There are finitely many wide subcategories in modA.
8. [92] Every brick in Mod A is a finitely presented A-module.
Remark 10.3. Note that by Theorem 10.2.3 we have that all torsion classes in the module category of a  -tilting finite algebra are functorially finite.
As we can see in Theorem 10.2,  -tilting finite algebras have module categories that are somehow manageable from a torsion theoretic perspective, even if they are wild. As a consequence, there is an ongoing informal programme that aims to classify all the  -tilting finite algebras. This problem has been attacked by several people in different families of algebras. The following is a list of families of algebras where some progress to understanding on the problem has been made. Note that this list is not exhaustive nor efficient, since some families are included in others.
· [51] Hereditary algebras.
· [2] Nakayama algebras.
· [48, 36] Cluster-tilted algebras.
· [1] Radical squared zero algebras.
· [102] Auslander algebras.
· [73] Preprojective algebras.
· [82, 83] Gentle algebras.
· [3] Brauer graph algebras.
· [91] Special biserial algebras.
· [17] Contraction algebras.
· [76] Non-distributive algebras.
11 Brauer-Thrall conjectures and  -tilting theory
The systematic study of representation theory for finite dimensional algebras, one can argue, started around the 1940's. At that time it was already known that every A-module can be written as a direct summand of indecomposable A-modules in essentially one way. As a consequence, people started to classify the algebras in two types, representation finite and representation infinite, depending on their number of isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules. Much of the motivation in the early days of representation theory of finite dimensional algebras stems from this quest of determining algebras of finite representation type with an important role being played by the first and second Brauer-Thrall Conjectures, which were proved subsequently by Roiter [86] and Auslander [18] for the first and by Nazarova and Roiter [81] and Bautista [28] for second. For an historical survey on Brauer-Thrall conjectures and its influence in representation theory, please see [57]. Their statement is the following.
30

Conjecture 11.1 (First Brauer-Thrall Conjecture). [18, 86] Let A be an algebra. Then A is of finite representation type if and only if there is a positive integer d such that dimK(M )  d for every indecomposable A-module M .
Conjecture 11.2 (Second Brauer-Thrall Conjecture). [28, 81] If A is an algebra of infinite representation type, then there is an infinite family of positive integers {di : i  N} such that for every di there is an infinite family of indecomposable A-modules {Mjdi} where dimK(Mjdi) = di for all j.
Then using the characterisation of  -tilting finite algebras given in Theorem 10.2.4 one can state a  -tilting analogue of the first Brauer-Thrall Conjecture by restricting the universe of modules to consider from indecomposable to bricks. The statement of the conjecture, which was proven for every finite dimensional algebra over a field in [90], is the following.
Conjecture 11.3 (First  -Brauer-Thrall Conjecture). [90] Let A be an algebra. Then A is  -tilting infinite if and only if there is a positive integer d such that dimK(M )  d for every brick M in modA.
The statement of this conjecture appeared independently in [91] and [75]. We note that recently a new proof of the validity of this conjecture was given in [77].
One can see immediately that the  -tilting version of the first Brauer-Thrall conjecture is a direct translation of the original. However, one can not do the same in the case of the second Brauer-Thrall conjecture, since there are  -tilting infinite algebras having finitely many infinite families of bricks. The  -tilting version of the second Brauer-Thrall conjecture is the following.
Conjecture 11.4 (Second  -Brauer-Thrall Conjecture). If A is a  -tilting finite algebra, then there is a positive integer d and an infinite family of bricks {Mjd} in modA such that dimK(Mjd) = d for all j.
This conjecture is still open in general. However, it has been verified for gentle algebras [83], special biserial algebras in [91, 75] and for distributive algebras in [76]. Remark 11.5. We note that if an algebra verifies the second  -Brauer-Thrall conjecture then it also verifies the second Brauer-Thrall conjecture due to a result of Smalø [95]. Remark 11.6. We also note that there are many examples of  -tilting finite algebras that are of infinite representation type, such us preprojective algebras [73] or contraction algebras [17], just to name a few.
12 Dimension vectors and g-vectors
In the introduction of these notes we said that many developments that occurred in representation theory in the twenty-first century, including  -tilting theory, were aiming to categorify cluster algebras to some extent.
In loose terms, the term categorification refers to the process of explaining some combinatorial phenomena by showing the existence some categorical phenomena. For instance, the bijection between the indecomposable  -rigid modules in the module category of a hereditary algebra of Dynkin type and the non-initial variables in the cluster algebra of the corresponding Dynkin type is a categorification of cluster variables.
31

But as there is a process of categorification, there is also a process of decategorification, a process where you start with a category and you find some combinatorial or numerical data that reflects the phenomena occurring at the categorical level.
From now on, we shift our focus to a different decategorification of  -tilting theory of an algebra using integer vectors.

12.1 The Grothendieck group of an algebra

The most classical decategorification using integer vectors of the representation theory associated to an algebra is the Grothendieck group of a category. We start by recalling the definition in the case of arbitrary abelian categories.
Definition 12.1. Let A be an abelian category. The Grothendieck group K0(A) of A is the quotient of the free abelian group generated by the isomorphism classes [M ] of all objects M  A modulo the ideal generated by the short exact sequences as follows.

K0(A) =

[M ] : M  A [M ] - [L] - [N ] : 0  L  M  N  0 is a short exact sequence in A

In these notes we are interested only in the module categories modA of finite dimensional algebras
A over an algebraically closed field. By abuse of notation, the Grothendieck group K0(modA) of modA will be denoted by K0(A) and we will refer to it as the Grothendieck group of A. As an immediate consequence of the Jordan-Hölder theorem for module categories we have the following result.

Theorem 12.2. Let A be an algebra. Then K0(A) is isomorphic to Zn, where n is the number of isomorphism classes of simple modules in modA.
From now on, we fix a complete set {[S(1)], . . . , [S(n)]} of isomorphism classes of simple Amodules. Clearly, {[S(1)], . . . , [S(n)]} forms a basis of K0(A). However, this is not the only basis of K0(A). In these notes, when we speak about the Grothendieck group of A we always assume that the basis chosen to represent our vectors is the basis given by the simple modules with a fixed order.
Theorem 12.3. Let A be an algebra and K0(A) be its Grothendieck group having as canonical basis the set {[S(1)], . . . , [S(n)]} of isomorphism classes of simple A-modules. Then for every object M  modA we have that

[M ] = (dimK(HomA(P (1), M )), . . . , dimK(HomA(P (n), M )))

[M ] = (dimK(HomA(M, I(1)), . . . , dimK(HomA(M, I(n)))))
where P (i) and I(i) are the projective cover and the injective envelope of the simple S(i), respectively, for all 1  i  n.
The previous result justifies that the element of the Grothendieck group [M ] associated to M is often called the dimension vector of M , terminology that we adopt in these notes as well.
Sometimes in the literature one finds the notation dimM for the dimension vector, reserving [M ] for the abstract class of M in the Grothendieck group with no prefered basis of K0(A).
Remark 12.4. In the previous result we are actually using the hypothesis that A is an algebra over an algebraically closed field. Otherwise, the result is not true in general. We warn the reader that this remark is also valid for several other results in this section.

32

12.2 g-vectors
Another set of integer vectors that can be associated to the category of finitely presented A-modules is the set of g-vectors.
Although the idea of g-vectors has been around for several decades, their systematic study is rather recent since the main motivation behind their study, as the reader might be guessing already, lies in the categorification of cluster algebras.
In fact, the name g-vector itself comes from cluster theory. The g-vectors were introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky in [49], where they conjectured that cluster variables could be parametrised using g-vectors. Later on, it was shown that g-vectors encoded the projective presentation of  -rigid A-modules. Their definition is the following.
Definition 12.5. Let M be an A-module. Choose the minimal projective presentation

P1 - P0 - M - 0

n

n

of M , where P0 = P (i)ai and P1 = P (i)bi. Then the g-vector of M is defined as

i=1

i=1

gM = (a1 - b1, a2 - b2, . . . , an - bn).

The g-vector of a  -rigid pair (M, P ) is defined as gM - gP .

Remark 12.6. Recently, Nakaoka and Palu introduced in [80] introduced the notion of extriangulated
categories. These categories are a generalisation of abelian where the notion of conflations replace
and generalise the notion of short exact sequences. So, one can define the Grothendieck group of any extriangulated category as we did in Definition 12.1, replacing the short exact sequences by the
conflations in this category. In the following section we will see that g-vectors can be thought as the elements of the Grothendieck group of an extriangulated category denoted by K[-1,0](projA).

13  -tilting theory and 2-term silting complexes
Associated to any finite dimensional algebra A there is a triangulated category known as the homotopy category of bounded complexes of finitely generated projective A-modules usually denoted by Kb(projA). The theory of homotopy categories is very rich, but out of the scope of these notes. The interested reader is encouraged to see [71] for a detailed account on that matter. However, Kb(projA) has a very special subcategory denoted by K[-1,0](projA) which plays a central role in  -tilting theory. In this section we first describe the category K[-1,0](projA) and then we explain its relation with  -tilting theory.
13.1 The category K[-1,0](projA).
As one usually does when defining a category, let us start by defining its objects. In this case, an object P of K[-1,0](projA) is a complex of the form P := P1 -f P0 where P0 and P1 are two projective A-modules and f  HomA(P1, P0). Now, given two objects P := P1 -f P0 and Q := Q1 -f Q0 in K[-1,0](projA) we define h  HomK[-1,0](projA)(P, Q) as a pair h := (h1, h2)

33

such that hi  HomA(Pi, Qi) making the following diagram commutative

P1 f // P0

h1
 ~~ Q1

t g

h0
 // Q0

modulo the equivalence relation given by if h, h  HomK[-1,0](projA)(P, Q), we impose that h is equal to h if there exists a map t : P0  Q1 such that tf = h1 - h1 and gt = h0 - h0.
We note that in this category one can associate to every pair of objects P, Q  K[-1,0](projA) an abelian group EK[-1,0](projA)(P, Q), known as the group of conflations of P by Q. This group is defined as EK[-1,0](projA)(P, Q) := HomK[-1,0](projA)(P, Q[1]), that is the group of maps h  HomA(P1, Q0) up to homotopy, meaning that h, h  HomA(P1, Q0) coincide in this category if there are maps ti  HomA(Pi, Qi) such that h - h = gt1 - t0f .

P1 f // P0

The notion of a conflation in an extriangulated category is a generalisation of that of short exact
sequences in abelian categories and distinguished triangles in triangulated categories, which endows K[-1,0](projA) with the structure of a extriangulated category, a notion very recently introduced by Nakaoka and Palu in [80]. A conflation is often denoted as follows.

LMN
One can then define the notion of a projective in K[-1,0](projA) as an object P  K[-1,0](projA) such that EK[-1,0](projA)(P, Q) = 0 for every object Q  K[-1,0](projA). Likewise, an injective object in K[-1,0](projA) is an object I  K[-1,0](projA) such that EK[-1,0](projA)(Q, I) = 0 for every object Q  K[-1,0](projA). As it turns out, the projective and injective objects of K[-1,0](projA) can be described explicitly,

projK[-1,0](projA) = 0 -0 P : P  projA

injK[-1,0](projA) = P -0 0 : P  projA
As we said before, we want to relate the category K[-1,0](projA) with the  -tilting theory of A. To do that, we first need to know how one can go from modA to K[-1,0](projA) and back.
In fact, one can see modA inside K[-1,0](projA). This comes from the fact that, by definition, modA is the category of finitely presented A-modules. This means that every A-module M admits a minimal projective presentation P1 -f P0 - M - 0, which induces a map P(-) : modA  K[-1,0](projA) defined as P(M ) = P1 -f P0 on the objects. We note that if A is a hereditary algebra, then P(-) is actually a functor.

34

On the other direction, there is a natural functor from H0(-) : K[-1,0](projA)  modA, usually known as the 0-th homology, which in this case consists of H0(P) = cokerf , where P = P1 -f P0. In fact, one can show that the kernel of the functor H0 corresponds to the ideal A - 0 generated by the injective objects of K[-1,0](projA).

modA

=

K [-1,0](pro jA) A - 0

In fact, it was noted by Gorsky, Nakaoka and Palu [55] that for every finite dimensional algebra A, the category K[-1,0](projA) is hereditary. In other words, they have shown that for every object
M  K[-1,0](projA) there is a conflation of the form

P1  P0  M
where P0 and P1 are projectives in K[-1,0](projA). This fact is highly surprising, since the global dimension of the module category of an algebra is arbitrary.
On the flip side, this fact together with the results that we state in the following subsection give a partial explanation of the good behaviour of  -tilting theory for every algebra. In fact, it follows of the exposed in in this section that the Grothendieck group K0(K[-1,0](projA)) of K([-1,0](projA)) is isomorphic to Zn, where the set [P(i)] = [0  P (i)] form a natural basis this Grothendieck group. In particular we have that the g-vector gM of any M  modA is the class [P(M )] of P(M )  K[-1,0](projA) written in the basis {[P(1)], . . . , [P(n)]}.

13.2  -tilting theory in K[-1,0](projA)
As we pointed out before, modA is a full subcategory of K[-1,0](projA). In particular, this implies that  -tilting theory can be studied naturally in this setting. For this we start with the following definition.
Definition 13.1. Let A be an algebra and P be an object in K[-1,0](projA). We say that P is presilting if HomK[-1,0](projA)(P, P[1]) = 0. Moreover, we say that P is silting if the number of isomorphism classes of indecomposable direct summands of P is equal to |A|.
Remark 13.2. We note that the previous definition is only valid for 2-term silting objects of Kb(projA). The proper definition of a silting object is more technical and possibly stronger. In fact, it is known that every silting object is presilting and has |A| isomorphism classes of indecomposable direct summands. However, it is not yet known if the converse holds.
We now state the main result of this section, where we denote by 2-silt(A) the set of 2-term silting objects in K[-1,0](projA). Also, we denote by H1(P) the maximal direct summand of P of the form P  0.
Theorem 13.3. Let A be an algebra. Then there is a bijection H(-) : 2-silt(A)   -tp-A between the set 2-silt(A) of 2-term silting objects in K[-1,0](projA) and the set  -tp-A of  -tilting pairs in modA, where the map is defined as
H(P) := (H0(P), H1(P)).
In particular, if P is a presilting object in K[-1,0](projA) the H(P) is a  -rigid pair with the same number of isomorphism classes of indecomposable direct summands.

35

Remark 13.4. In the Section 3 we have discussed the the problems that one has to define the basic
objects of  -tilting theory in module categories. However, we can see that  -tilting pairs adopt a very natural form in a category K[-1,0](projA) since we don't need to distinguish between  -rigid
modules and projective modules in the second entry of the pair. This is one of the arguments
supporting the idea that K[-1,0](projA) is the natural environment to study  -tilting theory. Even if we support this idea, we made the decision of writing this note in terms of  -tilting pairs to
emphasise the relationship of  -tilting theory and classical tilting theory.

14 g-vectors and  -tilting theory

In general there are many A-modules having the same projective presentation, which implies that gvectors are in some sense ambiguous. However this ambiguity disappears when we restrict ourselves to  -tilting theory.
Theorem 14.1. Let A be an algebra and let M and M  be two  -rigid A-modules. Then gM = gM if and only if M is isomorphic to M .
Although the spirit of the previous result can be found already in the work of Auslander and Reiten [22], the first appearance of this result stated in these terms was in the work on 2-Calabi-Yau categories of Dehy and Keller [40]. Later, this result was adapted to the context of  -tilting theory in the works of Adachi, Iyama and Reiten [4] and later extended by Demonet, Iyama and Jasso in [41] as follows.

Theorem 14.2. Let A be an algebra and let M and M  be two  -rigid A-modules. Suppose that (gM )i  (gM )i for 1  i  n. Then M is a quotient of M . In particular gM = gM if and only if
M is isomorphic to M .

In order to state the next result we need to fix some notation. Given a  -tilting pair (M, P ) we

fix a decomposition M =

k i=1

Mi

and

P

=

n j=k+1

Pj

of

M

and

P,

respectively.

Theorem 14.3. Let (M, P ) be a  -tilting pair. Then the set

{gM1 , . . . , gMk , -gPk+1 , . . . , -gPn }

form a basis of Zn.

14.1 g-vectors, dimension vectors and the Euler form
Given a finite dimensional algebra A, one can always associate to it a square matrix known as the Cartan matrix of the algebra as follows. Definition 14.4. Let A be an algebra and {P (1), . . . , P (n)} be a complete set of non-isomorphic indecomposable projective A-modules. The Cartan matrix CA of A is the n × n matrix
CA := ([P (1)]|[P (2)]| . . . |[P (n)])
where the i-th column is the dimension vector [P (i)] of P (i) for 1  i  n. The Euler characteristic of A is a Z-bilinear form
-, - A : K0(A) × K0(A)  Z
defined as [M ], [N ] A = [M ]T C-A1[N ], where [M ] and [N ] are though as column vectors.

36

An important property of the Euler characteristic of an algebra it is that provides useful homological information, as shown in the following proposition.
Proposition 14.5. Let A be an algebra of finite global dimension s and let M, N be two A-modules. Then
s
[M ], [N ] A = (-1)i dimK(ExtiA(M, N ))
i=0
where Ext0A(M, N ) stands for HomA(M, N ). In particular, if A is a hereditary algebra we have that
[M ], [N ] A = dimK(HomA(M, N )) - dimK(Ext1(M, N )).
Remark 14.6. The proof of the previous proposition relies onto the fact that {[P (1)], . . . , [P (n)]} forms a basis of Zn when A is of finite global dimension.
The following theorem was proven at the beginning of the 1980's by Auslander and Reiten in [?] but went unnoticed for several decades. Recently, with the development of  -tilting theory this result came to light again and it is playing a key role in some of the latest developments of this theory. To state the theorem, we denote by -, - : Rn × Rn  R the classical dot product in R.
Theorem 14.7. [22] Let M and N be modules over an algebra A. Then
gM , [N ] = dimK(HomA(M, N )) - dimK(Hom(N,  M )).
As a direct consequence of the previous result and the classical Auslander-Reiten formula we have the following corollary.
Corollary 14.8. Let A be a hereditary algebra and let M and N be two A-modules. Then
gM , [N ] = [M ], [N ] A.
Based on this last corollary, the author is of the opinion that the pairing between g-vectors and dimension vectors of modules is a  -tilting version of the Euler form of the algebra. Remark 14.9. We note that Theorem 14.7 establish a natural pairing
-, - : K0(K[-1,0](projA)) × K0(modA) - Z
between K0(K[-1,0](projA)) and K0(modA). This suggest that the extriangulated category K[-1,0](projA) can be thought as a sort of "dual" category for modA. We will discuss further this duality in Section 15.
14.2 c-vectors
We have seen in Theorem 14.3 that the set g-vectors of the indecomposable direct summands of a  -tilting pair (M, P ) form a basis of Zn. This fact, together with the so-called Tropical duality of cluster algebras [49, 45, 79], inspired Fu to introduce in [50] the notion of c-vector for finite dimensional algebras using  -tilting theory.
37

Definition 14.10. [50] Let (M, P ) be a  -tilting pair and let {gM1, . . . , gMk , -gPk+1, . . . , -gPn} be the corresponding basis of g-vectors of Zn. Define the g-matrix G(M,P ) of (M, P ) as

(gM1 )1 . . . (-gPn )1 

G(M,P ) =

gM1 , . . . , gMk , -gPk+1 , . . . , -gPn

= 

...

...

...

. 

(gM1 )n . . . (-gPn )n

Then the c-matrix C(M,P ) of (M, P ) is defined as C(M,P ) = (G-(M1,P ))T . Each column of C(M,P ) is called a c-vector of A. Moreover, we say that the i-th column of C(M,P ) is the i-th c-vector associated to (M, P ).

In the same paper, Fu showed that the c-vectors of certain families of algebras correspond to the dimension vector of bricks. These results were later generalised in [100] to every finite dimensional
algebra over an algebraically closed field as follows.

Theorem 14.11. [100] Let (M, P ) be a  -tilting pair with C-matrix C(M,P ). Then there exists a brick Bi in modA such that (-1)i[Bi] = ci is equal to the i-th c-vector associated to (M, P ). Moreover, [Bi] = ci if and only if Bi  FacM . Dually, -[Bi] = ci if and only if Bi  M .
Remark 14.12. Note that a direct consequence of this theorem is that every c-vector has either only non-negative coordinates or it has only non-positive entries. This is usually known as signcoherence of c-vectors. If a c-vectors c has only non-negative entries we say that c is a positive c-vector. Otherwise, we say that c is a negative c-vector.
In the previous result we have seen that the sign of the c-vectors associated to a  -tilting pair is connected with the torsion theory of (M, P ). In fact, this connection is very deep, as it can be seen in the following result.

Theorem 14.13. [100, 7] Let (M, P ) be a  -tilting pair and let B(M,P ) be the set of bricks

{Bi : [Bi] = ci for some 1  i  n}.

Then B(M,P ) is the unique semibrick in modA such that T (B(M,P )) = FacM .
Remark 14.14. An interesting consequence of the precious result is that one can label the Hasse quiver H(ftors-A) of ftors-A using (positive) c-vectors which is compatible with the brick labelling discussed in Section 9. Indeed, the labelling of c-vectors consists simply of taking the dimension vector of each brick in the brick labelling of ftors-A.
In Section 9 we spoke about the fact that we can associate to each maximal green sequence

{0} = T0 T1 · · · Tt-1 Tt = modA
a set B = {B1, . . . , Bt} of bricks in modA. One can show that the dimension vector [Bi] of Bi is a positive c-vector of (Mi, Pi), where (Mi, Pi) is the unique  -tilting pair such that Ti = FacMi. As a consequence, we can associate to every maximal green sequence a sequence [B] = {[B1], . . . , [Bt]} of positive c-vectors in modA. The following result was first shown by Garver, McConville and Serhiyenko for cluster-tilted algebras in [53, 54] and later generalised in [99] to any algebra over an algebraically closed field.
Theorem 14.15. [53, 54, 99] Every maximal green sequence {0} = T0 T1 · · · Tt = modA is determined by its associated sequence [B] of c-vectors.

15 The wall-and-chamber structure of an algebra
In this final section of the paper we introduce a geometric invariant for every algebra A, usually known as the wall-and-chamber structure of A, and we explain its relation with the  -tilting theory of the algebra. In particular, we will see that  -tilting theory recovers much, if not all, of the stability conditions on the algebra.
15.1 Stability conditions
The study of stability conditions in algebraic geometry started with the introduction of geometric invariant theory by Mumford [78]. In [68], King applied this theory to module categories leading to the following definition of stability conditions. In what follows, we always assume that the Grothendieck group K0(A) of the algebra A is isomorphic to Zn where the canonical basis of K0(A) is given by the set {[S(1)], . . . , [S(n)]}. Moreover, by abuse of notation, we identify [M ] with the corresponding vector of Zn using the previous isomorphism. Recall that we denote by -, - : Rn × Rn  R the classical dot product in R.
Definition 15.1. [68] Let M be an A-module with dimension vector [M ] and v be a vector in Rn. We say that M is v-semistable if v, [M ] = 0 and v, [L]  0 for every module L of M different from 0 or M . Similarly, we say that M is v-stable if v, [M ] = 0 and v, [L] < 0 for every module L of M different from 0 or M .
Later, Rudakov generalised this definition in [87]. Although the Rudakov's notion of stability conditions is outwith of the scope of this note, we now state some of the algebraic consequence that he deduced in that paper.
Theorem 15.2. [87] Let v be a vector in Rn. Then the category modvssA of all the v-semistable modules in modA form a wide subcategory of modA.
It is not difficult ro see that the v-stable modules correspond to the relative simple modules in modvssA. The following result shows that every v-semistable module can be built by successive extensions of v-stable modules.
Proposition 15.3. [87] For every vector v in Rn Then for every v-semistable module M there is a filtration
0 = M0  M1  · · ·  Mt-1  Mt = M
where Mi/Mi-1 is a v-stable module. Moreover, all such filtrations have the same length.
Remark 15.4. If the previous proposition reminds the reader the classical Jordan-Hölder theorem for the categories of A-modules, this is not a coincidence. We will see later that, for some specific vectors v, these filtrations correspond exactly with the filtrations by simple modules of an object in the module category of a smaller algebra that we can associate to v.
In fact, one can show that stability conditions have two naturally associated torsion pairs. This result, first shown by Baumann, Kamnitzer and Tingley in [27], reads as follows.
Proposition 15.5. [27] Let v be a vector in Rn. Then there are two torsion pairs (T0, F<0) and (T>0, F0) where:
· T0(v) := {X  modA : v, [Y ]  0 for every quotient Y of X}  {0},
39

· T>0(v) := {X  modA : v, [Y ] > 0 for every quotient Y of X}  {0}, · F0(v) := {X  modA : v, [Z]  0 for every subobject Z of X}  {0}, · F<0(v) := {X  modA : v, [Z] < 0 for every subobject Z of X}  {0}. Moreover the category modvssA = T0(v)  F0(v).

15.2 The wall-and-chamber structure of an algebra
As with many other notions in representation theory introduced since the turn of the century, one can find the origins of wall-and-chamber structures in cluster theory.
In this case, the wall-and-chamber structure of an algebra is inspired from the notion of scattering diagrams introduced by Gross, Hacking Keel and Kontsevich in [56] to study cluster algebras from a geometric perspective. The main idea is that one can associate to any cluster algebra A a geometric object (its scattering diagram) that encodes much of the algebraic properties of A. As we have already mentioned, cluster algebras can be categorified by the representation theory of the Jacobian algebras of quivers with potentials. Based on this connection, Bridgeland showed in [32] that scattering diagrams associated to cluster algebras with an acyclic initial seed can be constructed using the stability conditions of the module category of the corresponding jacobian algebra. This result was later extended by Mou in [74] for any cluster algebra having a green-to-red sequence.
More presicesly, Bridgeland showed in [32] that one can construct a scattering diagram for any finite dimensional algebra and that this scattering diagram is isomorphic to the cluster scattering diagram of [56] if the algebra is hereditary. The complete description of scattering diagrams will be skipped. Instead, we will define now the support of the scattering diagram of an algebra, which is now called the wall-and-chamber structure of an algebra. Its definition is as follows.
Definition 15.6. The stability space D(M ) of a module M is the set of vectors
D(M ) := {v  Rn : M is v-semistable}.
A chamber C is an open connected component of the set

Rn \

D(M )

0=M modA

of all vectors v in Rn such that there is no non-zero v-semistable module. A wall is a stability space D(M ) of codimension 1, that is, a stability space D(M ) such that the smallest subspace of
Rn containing it is an hyperplane.

Remark 15.7. Note that the wall and chamber structure is completely determined by its walls. Also, note that every wall is the stability space of a brick in the module category. However it is not true that every finite brick determines a wall. Also, it follows from the definition that the wall-and-chamber structure of an algebra is always a fan.
Remark 15.8. We would like to emphasise that the wall-and-chamber structure of a hereditary algebra is equivalent its semi-invariant picture introduced by Igusa, Orr, Todorov and Weymann in [61]. They based their construction on the notion of semi-invariant of quivers, a notion of stability condition introduced by Schofield in [89] which is based on the Euler form of the quiver instead of of the canonical inner product of Rn.

15.3 The g-vector fan of the algebra

Recall from Section 13 that g-vectors correspond to the elements of the Grothendieck group

K0(K[-1,0](projA)) of K[-1,0](projA) with respect to the basis given by the elements {[0  P (1)], . . . , [0  P (n)]}. As such, this group is isomorphic to Zn. However, in from this sec-

tion we want to relate g-vectors with stability conditions. Hence, we will see every g-vector gM

as a vector in Rn, where Rn = K0(K[-1,0](projA))  R where the canonical basis is given by {[0  P (1)], . . . , [0  P (n)]}.

The aim of this subsection is to study the distribution in Rn of the g-vectors of the indecompos-

able  -rigid objects. In order to do that, we start by associating a cone in Rn to each  -rigid pair.

For that, recall that we are assuming that both M and P are basic objects that can be written as

M=

k i=1

Mi

and

P

=

t j=k+1

Pj .

Definition 15.9. Let A be an algebra and let (M, P ) be a  -rigid pair whose set of g-vectors is

{gM1 , . . . , gMk , -gPk+1 , . . . , -gPt }.

Then we define the cone C(M,P ) to be the set





k

t





C(M,P ) =

igMi -

jgPj : i  0 for every 1  i  t .

 i=1

j=k+1



Similarly, we denote by C(M,P ) the interior of C(M,P ), that is





k

t





C(M,P ) =

igMi -

jgPj : i > 0 for every 1  i  t .

 i=1

j=k+1



Remark 15.10. We know from Theorem 14.3 that {gM1, . . . , gMk , -gPk+1, . . . , -gPt} are linearly

independent. In particular, this implies that the cone C(M,P ) is of codimension n - t.

Given two  always contains

-rigid pairs the origin 0

(M1, P1) and (M2, P2),  Rn. Suppose that (M

suCm(Mm2a,Pn2d)

of two different  -rigid pairs (M1, P1) and (M2, P2). Then it is clear that C(M,P )  C(M1,P1) and C(M,P )  C(M2,P2). In particular C(M1,P1)  C(M2,P2) = {0}. The following result by Demonet, Iyama and Jasso in [41] states that this is the only way in which this can happen.

Theorem 15.11. [41] Let A be an algebra and let (M1, P1) and (M2, P2) be two  -rigid pairs. Then C(M1,P1)  C(M2,P2) = {0} if and only if there is a  -rigid pair (M, P ) which is a direct summand of both (M1, P1) and (M2, P2). Moreover, if (M, P ) is the maximal common direct summand of (M1, P1) and (M2, P2) then C(M1,P1)  C(M2,P2) = C(M,P ).
An important consequence of the previous result is that the g-vectors of indecomposable  -rigid pairs have a geometrical structure known as polyhedral fan. Hence, it is common to refer the set of all g-vectors of indecomposable  -rigid pairs as the g-vector fan of the algebra.
In particular, the g-vector fan of a  -tilting finite algebra has finitely many cones associated to its  -rigid pairs. Moreover, these cones of g-vectors fit together very well, as was shown by Demonet, Iyama and Jasso in [41].

15.4  -tilting theory and stability conditions
In Section 14 we have seen that there is a natural pairing between g-vectors and dimension vectors that provides interesting homological information. For the convenience of the reader, we recall Auslander and Reiten's result here.
Theorem 15.13. [22] Let M and N be modules over an algebra A. Then
gM , [N ] = dimK(HomA(M, N )) - dimK(Hom(N,  M )).
Using this pairing as their main tool, it was shown in [33] and, independently, in [101] that we can recover the torsion classes FacM and  M  P  associated to a  -rigid pair (M, P ) from its g-vectors. The formal statement is the following.
Theorem 15.14. [33, 101] Let (M, P ) be a  -rigid pair and let v  C(M,P ). Then T>0(v) = FacM and T0(v) =  M  P . In particular, modvssA = M    M  P .
Combining this result with Theorem 6.4 we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 15.15. [33] Let (M, P ) be a  -rigid pair and let v  C(M,P ). Then the category modvssA of v-semistable modules is equivalent to the module category of the  -tilting reduction of (M, P ). In particular, the number of isomorphism classes of v-stable modules is n - |M | - |P |.

15.5 From  -tilting theory to the wall-and-chamber structure

An important fact that follows from Corollary 15.15 is that the category of v-semistable objects is

is

The first a  -tilting

thing to notice is that modvssA = {0} pair. Then, it is easy to see that C(M,P

for ) is

every vector v  a chamber in the

Cw(M all,P-a)nidf -acnhdamobnleyr

if (M, P ) structure

of A. This fact was first noticed in [33] and it was later shown by Asai in [8] that this is actually a

bijection. The formal statement is the following.

Theorem 15.16. [33, 8] Let (M, P ) be a  -tilting pair. Then C(M,P ) is a chamber in the walland-chamber structure of A. Moreover, every chamber arises this way. In particular, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of functorially finite torsion classes in modA and the set of chambers of the wall-and-chamber structure of A.

One can also see that for every  -tilting pair (M, P ) the set C(M,P ) \ C(M,P ) coincides with the union 1in C(Mi,Pi) of the cones C(Mi,Pi) associated to the n almost-complete  -rigid pairs {(M1, P1), . . . , (Mn, Pn)} that are a direct summand of (M, P ). Now, it follows from Theorem 15.14 that there exists exactly one brick Bi which is v-stable for every 1  i  n and every v  C(Mi,Pi). Then we have built a set {B1, . . . , Bn} of bricks in modA associated to (M, P ) using stability conditions. In the following result we show that we have encountered this set before.

42

Theorem 15.17. [100] Let (M, P ) be a  -tilting pair, v  C(M,P ) and let {B1, . . . , Bn} as above. Then the c-matrix C(M,P ) of (M, P ) is equal to
C(M,P ) = ( v, [B1] [B1] | v, [B2] [B2] | . . . | v, [Bn] [Bn] ).
In particular, this implies that we can recover the semibrick associated to (M, P ) directly from the wall-and-chamber structure of A, since it is exactly the set {Bi : v, [Bi] > 0} for any v  C(M,P ).
Given two chambers C1 and C2, we say that they are neighbouring each other if C1  C2 is a set of codimension 1 in Rn. In other words, we say that C1 and C2 are neighbours if they are separated by a wall. Another interesting consequence of Theorem 15.16 is the following.
Proposition 15.18. Let (M, P ) and (M , P ) be two  -tilting pairs. Then (M, P ) is a mutation of (M , P ) if and only if the chambers C(M,P ) and C(M,P ) associated to (M, P ) and (M , P ) respectively, are neighbours.
Note that we can construct a dual graph to the wall-and-chamber structure of an algebra, where the vertices correspond to the chambers and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the two corresponding chambers are neighbouring each other. Then the previous proposition is equivalent to the following.
Proposition 15.19. The dual graph of the wall-and-chamber structure of an algebra is isomorphic to the underlying graph H(ftors-A), the Hasse quiver of functorially finite torsion classes in modA.
In particular, this result implies that crossing a wall in the wall-and-chamber of A corresponds to a mutation of  -tilting pairs. Hence, one can realise any finite series of mutations of  -tilting pairs as paths in the wall-and-chamber structure of A. Then, in particular, every maximal green sequence in modA can be realised as a path in the wall-and-chamber structure of A, which solves the original motivation of [33].
Given a cone  in a fan , the star star() of  is the set of all the cones  in  having  as a face, that is, all the cones in  such that   . The following result due to Asai [?] shows that  -tilting reduction can be also realised at the level of wall-and-chamber structures.
Theorem 15.20. [8] Let (M, P ) be a  -rigid pair in modA. Then the wall-and-chamber structure of the  -tilting reduction B(M,P ) is isomorphic as a fan to star(C(M,P )) of the cone C(M,P ) associated to (M, P ).

15.6 Examples

In this subsection we give a couple of examples illustrating the results of this section.

Example 15.21. Consider the path algebra A2 = kQ of the quiver Q = 1 Reiten quiver is as follows:

D(P (1))

Figure 8: Wall and chamber structure for A2

A quick calculation shows that all indecomposable  -rigid pairs in modA are

{(P (2), 0), (P (1), 0), (S(1), 0), (0, P (2)), (0, P (1))}

and that the complete list of  -tilting pairs in modA is

{(P (1)  P (2), 0), (P (1)  S(1), 0), (S(1), P (2)), (0, P (1)  P (2)), (P (2), P (1))} .

In Figure 8 we have drawn in black the wall-and-chamber structure of A, the cones associated to
the indecomposable  -rigid pairs are in blue, and the chambers associated to each  -tilting pair is indicated in purple.

Example 15.22. We now take the algebra A that we considered in Example 3.10. That is the path algebra of the quiver

1 oo

@@ 2  3

modulo the second power of the ideal generated by all the arrows. The complete list of  -tilting
pairs in modA can be found in Table 1. The wall-and-chamber structure of A is in R3 since the rank of K0(A) is equal to 3. For the sake of readability, we choose to draw in Figure 9 a stereographic projection of it from a vector in the first orthant.

44

One can see there that all chambers in the wall-and-chamber structure of A are delimited by

exactly three walls. In red we indicate the image of the g-vectors of the indecomposable  -rigid

pairs. One can obtain the  -tilting pair inducing a particular chamber from the g-vectors situated in

the

corners

of

that

chamber.

For

instance,

the

chamber

C7

is

induced

by

the

 -tilting

pair

(2 3



3,

21).

This particular stereographic projection of the wall-and-chamber of A is particularly useful to

obtain the c-vectors associated to a given  -tilting pair, since the the curvature of each of the walls

indicate the sign of the corresponding c-vector. Using again the chamber C7, one can see that the

c-vectors

associated

to

(2 3



3,

)1
2

are

{[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [-1, 0, -1]}.

In

particular,

this

allows us to

conclude

that

the

semibrick

associated

to

(2 3



3,

)1
2

is

{2



3}.

Finally, note that there are 2 walls incident to the g-vector g3, while there are three which are

incident

to

the

g-vector

g

.1
2

This

is

due

to

the

fact

that

the

 -tilting

reduction

of

(3, 0)

is

isomorphic

to A1 × A1 while that of (12, 0) is isomorphic to A2.

15.7 Characterisations of  -tilting finite algebras
We conclude this note by adding to Theorem 10.2 several characterisations of  -tilting finite algebras that follow from the results that we have discussed in this last section. Theorem 15.23. Let A be an algebra. Then the following are equivalent.
1. A is  -tilting finite. 2. There are finitely many indecomposable  -rigid objects in modA. 3. [41] There are finitely many torsion classes in modA. 4. [42] There are finitely many bricks in modA. 5. [90] The lengths of bricks in modA is bounded. 6. [7] There are finitely many semibricks in modA. 7. [100] There are finitely many c-vectors in modA. 8. [70] There are finitely many wide subcategories in modA. 9. [92] Every brick in Mod A is a finitely presented A-module. 10. [41] The g-vector fan of A spans the whole Rn. 11. [33] The number of walls in the wall-and-chamber structure of A is finite. 12. [33] The number of chambers in the wall-and-chamber structure of A is finite. 13. [101] The number of different v-semistable subcategories of modA is finite.
