REPRESENTATIONS OF LOW COPOLARITY
ANDRE´ MAGALHA~ ES DE SA´ GOMES AND CLAUDIO GORODSKI
Abstract. We classify irreducible representations of compact connected Lie groups whose orbit space is isometric to the orbit space of a representation of a compact Lie group of dimension 7, 8 or 9. They turn out to be closely related to symmetric spaces, with one exception only.
1. Introduction
A representation  : G  O(V ) of a compact Lie group G is called polar if there exists a subspace , called a section, that meets all G-orbits, and meets them always orthogonally. This notion was made explicit over 35 years ago and has many connections and ramifications, among them, with symmetric spaces, invariant theory and submanifold geometry (see e.g. [Dad85, DK85, BCO03]). For a polar representation as above, the space of orbits V /G can be recovered, as a metric space, as the space of orbits of a finite group action, namely, /W, where W is the largest subquotient group of G acting on the section . Indeed, as an easy consequence of O'Neill's formula for Riemannian submersions, one sees that the later property characterizes polar representations (cf. [GL15], introd.).
Polar representations were classified by Dadok [Dad85]; it follows from this classification that a polar representation of a connected group has the same orbits as the isotropy representation of a symmetric space. The above considerations and the general importance of polar representations led the authors of [GL14] to seek other classes of orthogonal representations whose orbit spaces can be presented in different ways, and to investigate the mysterious interplay between geometric and algebraic aspects of representations. Namely, one says that two representations are quotient-equivalent if they have isometric orbit spaces; in addition, if the underlying group of one representation has dimension strictly less than the dimension of the underlying group of the other one, then one says the former representation is a reduction of the latter one. It follows that the polar representations of connected groups are precisely those that admit a reduction to a finite group action.
A minimal reduction of a given representation is a reduction whose underlying group has minimal dimension in that quotient-equivalence class; in this case, the dimension of this group is called the abstract copolarity of the given representation. For instance, polar representations of connected groups are precisely those representations of abstract copolarity zero. As one of the main results of [GL14], it was shown that if a non-polar irreducible representation of a compact connected

Lie group admitting a reduction has abstract copolarity at most six, then the representation is toric, that is, it has a minimal reduction to a representation of a finite extension of a torus. In the same paper, it was found a counterexample for abstract copolarity 7: (U(3) × Sp(2), C3 C C4) reduces to a Z2-extension of (the 7-dimensional group) (O(3) × U(2), R3 R R4), where O(3) × U(2) sits inside U(3) × Sp(2) as a symmetric subgroup (see also [Gom21]). Toric irreducible representations were later classified in [GL15] (they are mostly related to Hermitean symmetric spaces; see also [Pan17]).
In the present work, we wanted to understand the extent of the above counterexample. As it turns out, we can show it is the only counterexample in abstract copolarity 7, and we go a little further:
Theorem 1.1. Let  : G  O(V ) be a non-polar, non-reduced, irreducible representation of a compact connected Lie group G on the Euclidean space V . Assume the abstract copolarity of  is 7, 8 or 9. Then  is either toric, quaternion-toric, or equivalent to (U(3) × Sp(2), C3 C C4).
A representation is called non-reduced if it admits a reduction; it is called quaternion-toric (or q-toric, for short) if it is non-polar and admits a reduction to a representation of a group whose identity component is isomorphic to Sp(1)k for some k > 0. Q-toric representations were classified in the irreducible case in [GG18] (they are related to quaternion-K¨ahler symmetric spaces); in particular, it was shown that k = 3 always holds, so they have abstract copolarity 9. In particular, an irreducible representation of a connected Lie group with abstract copolarity 8 must be toric.
Another consequence of Theorem 1.1 is that, for the representations in the theorem, the abstract copolarity coincides with the copolarity. The copolarity of a representation  : G  O(V ) is the minimal possible dimension of H, where  : H  O(W ) is an arbitrary reduction of  such that H is a subgroup of G, W is a subspace of V , and  is the restriction of . Thus the copolarity considers only reductions "embedded" in the given representation; in particular, the abstract copolarity is bounded above by the copolarity. It is an open problem to decide whether they always coincide.
In view of the results and calculations in the present paper, one is tempted to formulate the following conjecture: Suppose G is connected and  : G  O(V ) is a non-polar, non-reduced, irreducible representation that reduces to  : H  O(W ). Then H0 is not simple.
The results in this paper are part of the PhD thesis of the first author.
2. Preliminaries
Let  : G  O(V ) be a representation of a compact Lie group G. Then V inherits a G-invariant stratification by orbit types, namely, two points in V are in the same stratum if and only if they have conjugate isotropy groups. This stratification projects to a stratification of the orbit space X = V /G. The strata in X are locally convex Riemannian manifolds, and their connected components can be recognized metrically as points in X with isometric tangent spaces. The maximal dimensional stratum Xreg is unique, convex, open and dense, and consists of the principal orbits, namely, those orbits with minimal isotropy groups, called principal isotropy groups. The cohomogeneity of  is the codimension of the principal orbits,
2

which also coincides with the topological dimension of X. The closure of the union
of strata of codimension one in X is called the boundary of X, and it is denoted
by X. We say that p  V is G-principal if it lies in a G-principal orbit, and it is
G-important if it projects to a stratum of codimension one in X. Locally at p  V ,
the orbit decomposition of V is completely determined by the slice representation
of the isotropy group Gp on the normal space p(Gp) to the orbit Gp: namely, the tangent cone TxX is isometric to the orbit space of the slice representation at p, where x is the projection of p; in particular, the fixed point set of the slice
representation is tangent to the stratum of p in V , and the cohomogeneity of the
slice representation modulo the fixed point set is equal to the codimension of the
stratum of x in X.
The strategy to investigate reductions of representations introduced in [GL14] is
based on the following dichotomy. Suppose  : G  O(V ) is a minimal reduction
of  : H  O(W ), where H is connected. Then the principal isotropy groups
of  are trivial, and: (i) either G is connected, and V /G = W/H has non-empty boundary [GL14, Proposition 5.2]; (ii) or G is disconnected, and G/G0 is generated by nice involutions, that is, elements of G of order 2 that fix a G0-principal and Gimportant point, and act on V /G0 as a reflection [GL14, Proposition 1.2 and § 4.3].
In case (i), the boundary components arise as Sa-isotropy types, where a = 1 or a = 3. More precisely, if p  V is a G-important point, then Gp is a sphere Sa and the slice representation, modulo the fixed point set, is (S1, C) or (S3, H). In case (ii), the boundary components arise as S0-isotropy types, where S0 = Z2, and the slice representation at a corresponding important point, modulo the fixed point
set, is (Z2, R). In any case, we have the dimension formula

(2.1)

dim V - a - 1 = dim G - dim NG(Gp) + dim V Gp ,

where NG(Gp) denotes the normalizer of Gp in G, and dim V Gp denotes the fixed point set of Gp in V .

3. Abstract copolarity 7
We proceed to prove Theorem 1.1 using the method outlined in section 2. In this section, we address the case of abstract copolarity 7. So assume  : H  O(W ) is a non-polar irreducible a representation of a compact connected Lie group H that reduces to  : G  O(V ), where dim G = 7 and G0 is not Abelian, and  is a minimal reduction.
Recall that  is irreducible, since  is assumed irreducible, and the irreducibility of a representation can be read off its quotient [GL14, § 5.2]. If the restriction of  to the identity component G0 were reducible, then  would be toric [GL14, Theorem 1.7], so we know that also |G0 is irreducible. Now the center of G0 can be at most one-dimensional, so G0 is locally isomorphic to U(1) × SU(2) × SU(2).
3.1. Connected case. Herein we assume G is connected. Then V /G has nonempty boundary. Let p  V be a G-important point. We first rule out the case Gp = S3. Indeed a S3 = SU(2)-subgroup of G must correspond to one of the SU(2)-factors in G, or the diagonal in SU(2) × SU(2). In any case, the nontrivial element z in the center of Gp is a central element of G. The fixed point set of z is not zero, as it contains p, and it is preserved by G; but this contradicts the irreducibility of G.
3

Now Gp = S1. Since the rank of G is 3, dim NG(Gp)  3. By the dimension formula (2.1),
dim V  6 + dim V Gp .
Since G contains a central circle,  is a representation of complex type. For a maximal torus of G containing Gp, we have that V Gp is a sum of weight spaces; more precisely, those weight spaces whose weights lie in the annihilator of a generator of the Lie algebra of Gp. Since the dimension of the annihilator is two, there are at most two linearly independent weights appearing in V Gp. Next, note that the restriction of any weight to the central circle in G is independent of the weight. It follows that there are no linearly dependent weights appearing in V Gp. We deduce that there are at most two weights appearing in V Gp ; hence
dim V  10.
Now the cohomogeneity of  is at most 3. It is known that such representations must be either polar or of abstract copolarity 1 ([Str94, Theorem 5.1], [GOT04, Theorem 1.1] and [GL14, Corollary 1.6 and Example 1.9]). Therefore this case is not possible.

3.2. Disconnected case. Now we assume G is disconnected. Then there exists a nice involution w  G, namely, w2 = I and

(3.2)

dim V = 8 - dim ZG0(w) + dim V w,

where ZG0(w) denotes the centralizer of w in G0 and V w denotes the fixed point
set of w in V . The conjugation of G0 by w defines an involutive automorphism  of G0, namely,

(3.3)

((g)) = w(g)w-1

for all g  G0. Since w  (G0), and the centralizer of (G0) in O(V ) coincides with its center,  cannot be an inner automorphism of G0.
We may lift |G0 to the universal covering and assume G0 = U(1)×SU(2)×SU(2). Any automorphism of this group must preserve the central circle and permute
the SU(2)-factors. Since SU(2) has no outer automorphisms, the group of outer automorphisms Aut(G0)/Inn(G0) is generated by the commuting involutions 1, 2 : G0  G0, where 1(t, g1, g2) = (t¯, g1, g2) and 2(t, g1, g2) = (z, g2, g1). We may replace 1 by an appropriate G0-conjugate and assume 1(t, g1, g2) = (t¯, g¯1, g¯2).
Note that V = C C Cm C Cn as a U(1) × SU(2) × SU(2)-representation. We
have 1 is induced by conjugation by   O(V ), where  is complex conjugation of V over the real form R R Rm R Rn, namely,

(3.4)

(1(g)) = (g)-1

for all g  G0. In case m = n, also 2 is induced by conjugation by   O(V ), where (z, z1, z2) =
(z, z2, z1), namely,

(3.5)

(2(g)) = (g)-1

for all g  G0. Write  = Innh  , where 1 =   1, 2 and h  G0, and Innh denotes the
inner automorphism defined by h. We may assume h has no component in the central circle. Now 2 = I implies h(h) lies in the center Z(G0) of G0. Since
4

either (1, -1, 1) or (-1, -1, 1) (resp. (1, 1, -1) or (-1, 1, -1)) lies in the kernel of , we can write

(3.6)

(h) = h-1.

If  permutes the SU(2)-factors of G0, i. e.  involves 2, then m = n. In particular, if  = 2, then (3.6) implies that h = (1, h1, h-1 1)  G0 for some h1  SU(2). Replacing w by (1, 1, h1)w(1, 1, h1)-1, we may assume that  = 2.

It follows from (3.3) and (3.5) that w centralizes (G0). By Schur's lemma, w =  for some   U(1), and from w2 = I we deduce that w = ±. In any case,

dim ZG0(w) = 4, so (3.2) gives 2n2 = 4 + dim V w. Note that V w is the space of symmetric (resp. skew-symmetric) tensors, so dim V w = n(n + 1) (resp. n(n - 1)).

It follows that n2 ± n = 4, but these equations have no integer solutions, so  = 2

is impossible.

h1

Similarly,  SU(2).

if  = 12, then (3.6) implies that h = Replacing w by (1, 1, ¯h1)w(1, 1, ¯h1)-1,

(1, h1, h¯-1 1)  G0 for some we may assume that  =

12. It follows from (3.4) and (3.5), together with Schur's lemma and w2 = I,

that w = ±. In any case, dim ZG0(w) = 3 so (3.2) gives 2n2 = 5 + dim V w. Note

that V w is the space of Hermitean (resp. skew-Hermitean) tensors, so dim V w = n2.

It follows that n2 = 5, but this equation has no integer solutions, so  = 12 is

impossible.

It remains the case  = 1. Using (3.6), we obtain h = (1, h1, h2), where

hi  SU(2) is a symmetric matrix, for i = 1, 2. Taking the imaginary part of hihi = hih¯i = 1 shows that hi and hi are commuting (real symmetric) matrices. Therefore there is ki  SO(2) such that kihiki-1 is a diagonal matrix di. Now let d1i /2 be a square root of di and put ai = di-1/2ki. Then aihiati = 1. Let a = (1, a1, a2). Then (a) = ha. Using this, we see that by replacing w by (a)w(a)-1,  gets

replaced by 1. Therefore we may assume  = 1. Now w centralizes (G0), so

Schur's lemma and w2 = I yield that w = ±. In any case, dim ZG0(w) = 2 and

dim V w =

1 2

dim V ,

so

(3.2)

yields

that

dim V

= 12.

This is the representation

(U(2) × SU(2), C2 C C3) or, equivalently, (U(2) × SO(3), R4 R R3), which is the

representation in the statement of Theorem 1.1.

4. Abstract copolarity 8
In this section we assume  : H  O(W ) is a non-polar irreducible representation of a compact connected Lie group H that reduces to  : G  O(V ), where dim G = 8 and G0 is not Abelian, and  is a minimal reduction. As in the previous section, |G0 must be irreducible, and hence G0 must be covered by SU(3).
4.1. Connected case. Herein we assume G is connected. We will show that V /G must have empty boundary and hence  cannot be a reduction of  . This follows immediately from the following result from [GKW21]: Every irreducible representation of a compact connected simple Lie group with non-empty boundary in the orbit-space must be polar, toric, q-toric or a half-spin representation of Spin(11). In the sequel we give an alternative argument.
We first note that there are no S3-boundary components. Indeed it follows follows from [Sch80, Corollary 13.4] that a necessary condition for the existence of boundary is that the Dynkin index of the complexification c is less than one. But [AVE´ 67, Table 1] implies that such a representation would be polar.
5

Now, let p be a G-important point projecting to a S1-boundary component. Since the rank of G0 is 2, the dimension formula (2.1) says

(4.7)

dim V  8 + dim V Gp .

We next estimate dim V Gp . Consider a maximal torus T of G0 that contains Gp, so that V Gp is a sum of weight spaces. Recall that the diagram of weights of V

look like a sequence of concentric hexagons followed by a sequence of concentric

triangles [FH91, p. 183-184]. Since the Lie algebra of Gp has codimension one in the Lie algebra of T , the weights associated to weight spaces appearing in V Gp all

lie in a line through the origin. This line can meet at most two weights in each

hexagon (resp. triangle).

Consider first the case  is the realification of a,b, where a > b, a,b is the complex irreducible representation of SU(3) of highest weight a1 + b2, and 1, 2 denote the fundamental weights. Then the diagram of weights consists of hexagons

b).

The Weyl dimension formula gives dim V = (a + 1)(b + 1)(a + b + 2), and one

easily sees that the only solution to (4.7) is (a, b) = (1, 0), which gives the vector

representation, a polar representation.

Consider next the case  is a real form of a,a. Then the diagram of weights consists of hexagons H0, . . . , Ha-1, the multiplicities of weights on Hi being i + 1, and a point Ha with multiplicity a + 1. We obtain

dim V Gp  (a + 1)2.

Since dim V = (a+1)3, the only solution to (4.7) is a = 1, the adjoint representation, which is polar.

4.2. Disconnected case. Herein we assume G is disconnected. We will show that
V /G must have empty boundary and hence  cannot be a reduction of  . There is a nice involution w  G, so that w2 = I and

(4.8)

dim V = 9 - dim ZG0(w) + dim V w.

As in subsection 3.2, the conjugation of G0 by w defines an automorphism  of G0. We will deal separately with the cases in which  is of inner or outer type.

4.2.1. Outer type. It follows from [Wol11] that, replacing w by a (G0)-conjugate, we may assume  = , where  is the Weyl involution, given by (g) = g¯ for all g  G0.
We first check |G0 cannot be absolutely irreducible. Indeed, if this is the case, the complexification (|G0)c =:  is irreducible. Denote by  the complex conjugation of V c over V . Then      and    are equivalent representations. So there is a unitary transformation A of V c such that
A(g)A-1 = ((g)) = w(g)w-1,
for all g  G0, where we have denoted the complex linear extension of w to V c by the same letter. This says that (A)-1w centralizes (G0), so Schur's lemma yields that w is a complex multiple of A. We reach a contradiction, as A is not a complex transformation of V c.
6

Now |G0 is not absolutely irreducible. Then it is the realification of a representation  of G0 on a complex vector space U . Let  be the conjugation of U over
any real form. Then      and    are equivalent representations, so as above we can write w = A, for some   S1, and some unitary transformation A of U . We can replace w by -1/2w1/2 = A. Next, since  is conjugate linear, we have

I = w2 = (A)2 = (A)A = A¯A,

that is, A is unitary and symmetric. Write A = BBt, where B is a unitary

matrix, similar what was done in the end of section 3.2. Then Btw(Bt)-1 =

B¯-1A(Bt)-1 = B-1(BBt)(Bt)-1 = , so we may indeed assume w = . Since w is

conjugate

linear,

we

have

dim V w

=

1 2

dim V .

Further,

dim ZG0 (w)

=

dim SO(3)

=

3, so the dimension formula (4.8) yields dim V = 12. This implies that the cohomo-

geneity of , and hence also of  , is 4, but all non-polar, non-reduced, irreducible

representations of cohomogeneity 4 of compact connected Lie groups have abstract

copolarity 2 [GL14, Theorem 1.11].

4.2.2. Inner type. Write w = (h)z, where h  G0, and I = z  O(V ) centralizes

(G0). From w2 = I we deduce that h2 lies in the center Z(G0). If h  Z(G0) then

(h) and z are scalar maps, and so w = ±I, which cannot be. Now h  Z(G0), and

0 0
we can conjugate h to a diagonal matrix and assume h = 0 - 0 , where  is a
0 0 -
cubic root of 1. It follows that dim ZG0(w) = dim ZG0(h) = 4, and the dimension formula gives dim V - dim V w = 5 is odd. This already implies that  cannot

leave invariant a complex structure on V . Now Schur's lemma yields z = -I, so

w = -(h) = -(

10 0 0 -1 0

) = ±(

10 0 0 -1 0

), and we get dim V h = 5.

0 0 -1

0 0 -1

We know that  is a real form of a,a (notation as in subsection 4.1). Consider

the maximal torus of G0 consisiting of diagonal matrices, so (V c)h = (V h)c is a

sum of weight spaces. It is clear that the set of weights associated to weight spaces

in (V c)h is invariant under multiplication by -1. Since the multiplicity of the zero

weight in a,a is a + 1, we deduce that 5 = dim V h = dimC(V c)h  a + 1, and a

cannot be an odd number. We are only left to examine the cases a = 2 and a = 4.

Let e1, e2, e3 denote the canonical basis of C3 and let e1, e2, e3 denote the dual basis of C3. The highest weight vector of a,a is ea1  e1a, which is fixed by h for all a. Using the action of the Weyl group, the vectors eaj  eja lie in V c for j = 1, 2, 3, and they are clearly also fixed by h, together with the corresponding

weight vectors with the opposite weights, and the zero weight space. This gives the

estimate dim V h  3 · 2 + (2 + 1) = 9 for a  2, which contradicts dim V h = 5.

5. Abstract copolarity 9
In this section we assume  : H  O(W ) is a non-polar irreducible representation of a compact connected Lie group H that reduces to  : G  O(V ), where dim G = 9 and G0 is not Abelian, and  is a minimal reduction. As in the previous section, |G0 must be irreducible, and hence G0 must be locally isomorphic to U(3) or Sp(1)3, but the latter case is q-toric, so we need not consider it. Now  is a representation of complex type.
5.1. Connected case. Herein we assume G is connected, so G is covered by U(1)× SU(3). We will show that V /G must have empty boundary and hence  cannot be a reduction of  .
7

Note that if p is a G-important point that projects to a S3-boundary component, then the restriction of  to the simple subgroup SU(3) is a (non-orbit equivalent) representation which is either irreducible of complex type, or with two equivalent irreducible components of real type, and which also has p as an important point projecting to a S3-boundary component. By [Sch80, §13] and [AVE´ 67, Table 1], there are no possibililties for .
Now, let p be a G-important point projecting to a S1-boundary component. Since the rank of G is 3, the dimension formula (2.1) says

(5.9)

dim V  8 + dim V Gp .

Again, since G has rank 3 and contains a central circle, as in subsection 3.1 we see that V Gp is a sum of at most two weight spaces. Suppose  is the realification of a,b. Then the highest multiplicity of a weight is b + 1, so dim V Gp  4b + 4, and (5.9) implies
(a + 1)(b + 1)(a + b + 2)  12 + 4b.
The only solution is (a, b) = (1, 0), which corresponds to a polar representation.

5.2. Disconnected case. Herein we assume G is disconnected. We will show that
V /G must have empty boundary and hence  cannot be a reduction of  . There is a nice involution w  G, so that w2 = I and

(5.10)

dim V = 10 - dim ZG0(w) + dim V w.

As in subsection 3.2, the conjugation of G0 by w defines an automorphism  of G0. Since w  (G0), and the centralizer of (G0) in O(V ) coincides with its center,  must be an outer automorphism of G0.
Since the center of (G0) acts by scalars and is normalized by w, we may assume that G0 = U(3), up to orbit-equivalence. Now the group of outer automorphisms of G0 is generated by , where (g) = g¯ for g  U(3). Similar to the situation in
subsection 4.2.1, we may replace w by a conjugate and assume  = . Here we
already know |G0 is not absolutely irreducible. Continuing with the argument in subsection 4.2.1, we may assume w = . Now dim ZG0(w) = 3, so the dimension formula (5.10) yields dim V = 14. However, there exist no irreducible representations
of dimension 14 of U(3). This finishes the proof of Theorem 1.1.
