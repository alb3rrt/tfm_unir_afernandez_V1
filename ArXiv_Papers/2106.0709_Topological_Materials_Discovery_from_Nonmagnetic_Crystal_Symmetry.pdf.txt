(Dated: June 3, 2021)
We present a review of topological electronic materials discovery in crystalline solids from the prediction of the first 2D and 3D topological insulators (TIs) through the recently introduced methods that have facilitated large-scale searches for topological materials. We first briefly review the concepts of band theory and topology, as well as the experimental methods used to demonstrate nontrivial topology in solid-state materials. We then review the past 15 years of topological materials discovery, including the identification of the first nonmagnetic TIs, topological crystalline insulators (TCIs), and topological semimetals (TSMs). Most recently, through complete analyses of symmetry-allowed band structures ­ including the theory of Topological Quantum Chemistry (TQC) ­ researchers have determined crystal-symmetry-enhanced Wilson-loop and complete symmetry-based indicators for nonmagnetic topological phases, leading to the discovery of higherorder TCIs and TSMs. Lastly, we discuss the recent application of TQC and related methods to high-throughput materials discovery, which revealed that over half of all of the known stoichiometric, solid-state, nonmagnetic materials are topological at the Fermi level, over 85% of the known stoichiometric materials host energetically isolated topological bands, and that just under 2/3 of the energetically isolated bands in known materials carry the stable topology of a TI or TCI. We conclude by discussing future venues for the identification and manipulation of solid-state topological phases, including charge-density-wave compounds, magnetic materials, and 2D few-layer devices.

I. INTRODUCTION
Nearly 15 years have passed since the first theoretical predictions of the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect [1­ 3] in what are now known as 2D topological insulators (TIs). TIs, as well as topological semimetals (TSMs), are unique solid-state systems that exhibit robust boundary states and quantized bulk response coefficients as a consequence of their electronic wavefunctions. Because topological boundary states survive under moderate disorder and frequently exhibit spin polarization and spin-momentum locking, topological materials represent a promising possible venue for storing and manip-

ulating quantum information [4­6], and realizing coherent spin transport [7­9] and high-efficiency catalysis [10­ 12]. Since the discovery of the first TIs, a large number of both insulating and (semi)metallic topological phases have been predicted, characterized, and measured in experimentally accessible chemical compounds. This unprecedented pace of topological materials discovery has been driven by several major factors. From a theoretical perspective, the discovery of novel topological phases has been facilitated by the rapid development of bandtheoretic topological invariants and the rediscovery and application of crystalline symmetry and group theory. However, it is equally important to attribute the growth of topological condensed-matter physics to the major advances in cloud storage and large-scale computing that have enabled high-throughput calculations, and to dramatic improvements in network bandwidth and digital

communication that have enabled close collaboration be-

tween international teams of theorists and experimental-

ists.

In this work, we will review topological materials dis-

covery from the identification of the first TIs and TSMs

to the modern, "Renaissance" era of high-throughput

topological classification and materials databases. For

each stoichiometric 3D material discussed in this review,

we will additionally provide the Inorganic Crystal

Structure Database (ICSD) [13, 14] accession code

of the material with a hyperlink to the associated

page on the Topological Materials Database (https:

see

Sec. VIII) [15, 16], as well as the number and standard-

setting symbol of the crystallographic space group (SG,

see Sec. II A) of the material.

Owing to the sheer volume of impactful discoveries

made since the prediction of 2D TIs, some topological

materials and classifications are only lightly covered or

unfortunately omitted from this review. Interested read-

ers may consult a number of previous reviews, includ-

ing [17­22]. Additionally, in this review, we will fo-

cus on the discovery and characterization of topology

in the electronic structure of crystalline chemical com-

pounds with weak interactions and negligible disorder.

As such, we will not discuss the topological characteri-

zation of metamaterials, sonic and Floquet crystals, su-

perconductors, classical mechanical systems, magnonic

bands, and strongly disordered systems, which have also

seen tremendous advances in recent years.

The red (blue) curves at the 1a (1b) Wyckoff position in the left-most unit cell symbolize exponentially localized, inversion- (I-) symmetric Wannier orbitals [18, 28, 29] obtained from inverse-Fourier-transforming bands with a Berry phase 1 = 0 (1 = ) [30] (equivalently termed a Zak phase [31]). (b) k points in the first Brillouin zone (BZ) of the 1D crystal in (a) are related to k points in the second BZ by the reciprocal lattice vector G. For a set of occupied bands |uk at each point k in the first BZ, the discretized Wilson loop matrix W1 is defined as the product of the outer products of |uk and |uk+1 taken over a finite mesh of k points in the first BZ (as well as a sewing matrix V ) [32­35]. Crucially, for an energetically isolated set of bands, the total Berry phase 1 mod 2 is related to the Wilson loop matrix by det[W1] = exp(i1).

II. TOPOLOGICAL BAND THEORY
In this section, we will first in Sec. II A introduce the band theory of crystalline solids. Then, in Sec. II B, we will detail methods through which an energetically isolated set of bands can be diagnosed as topologically nontrivial. In Sec. II B, we will also address experimentally observable signatures of topological bands in solid-state materials. Throughout this section, we will highlight terminology frequently employed in the study of topological materials.
A. The Band Theory of Crystalline Solids
From a theoretical perspective, a crystal is defined as a system in which physical observables, such as the energy spectrum and the locations of atoms, are periodic under the action of discrete translations. From an experimental perspective, the picture is more complicated ­ samples of crystalline materials carry defects, misoriented domains, and coexisting structural orders, such as left- and righthanded enantiomers [23­26]. In this section, we will focus on the underlying mathematical machinery used to characterize the electronic states in theoretical models of

pristine, solid-state crystals. Later, in Sec. II B, we will briefly generalize to models that incorporate sources of deviation from the perfect-crystal limit, such as disorder.
To begin, in a theoretical model of a pristine, solidstate crystal, electronic phenomena are captured through a position- (r-) space Hamiltonian that is periodic with respect to the group of 3D lattice translations [27] [Fig. 1(a)]. In this review, we will restrict focus to non-interacting materials, whose energy spectra and electronic response properties are largely captured in the mean-field approximation in which electron-electron correlations are either incorporated as background fields or taken to vanish. While the noninteracting electronic Hamiltonian H(r) generically contains off-diagonal elements that couple states at different positions r and r , the Fourier-transformed Bloch Hamiltonian H(k) is diagonal in k. The energy eigenvalues of the Bloch Hamiltonian H(k) form bands that are periodic with respect to advancing the crystal momentum k by a reciprocal lattice vector G: k  k + G [Fig. 1(b)]. In k-space, the unit cells of the reciprocal lattice are known as the Brillouin zones (BZs) [23, 27]. In solid-state materials, the bands are populated by electrons up to the Fermi energy (EF ). Hence, crystals are filled with spinful fermions (electrons), even in the limit that coupling between the atomic orbitals and electron spins [spin-orbit coupling (SOC)] is negligible.

3

In addition to translation symmetry, 3D crystals may respect other unitary symmetries, such as spatial inversion (I), or antiunitary symmetries, such as time-reversal (T ). The set of symmetries that leave the orbitals (and electron spins) in an infinite crystal invariant (up to integer lattice translations) form a group ­ whether it is a space, layer, wallpaper, rod, or other group depends on the dimensionalities of lattice translations and crystal symmetries [36]. The symmetries of nonmagnetic 3D crystals are specifically contained within the 230 nonmagnetic (T -symmetric) SGs [27]. Crucially, unitary particle-hole (i.e. chiral) symmetry, which relates the valence and conduction bands, is generically absent in real materials. The accidental or intentional incorporation of chiral symmetry into topological models is a common source of spurious predictions. Therefore, chiral symmetry, while a helpful bootstrap for forming simple models, should be carefully relaxed when predicting robust topological phenomena.
At each k point, bands can be uniquely labeled by the eigenvalues of simultaneously-valid (commuting) unitary symmetries. The independent combinations of simultaneous symmetry eigenvalues can then be inferred from the matrix representatives of the small irreducible representations of the symmetry (little) group of each k point [27]. When the actions of antiunitary symmetries are incorporated, irreducible representations may become paired into irreducible corepresentations (coreps) [37, 38]. In crystals with antiunitary symmetries ­ most notably including nonmagnetic solid-state materials ­ the bands at each k point are labeled by small coreps; the small coreps corresponding to all possible electronic states in nonmagnetic crystals were tabulated in [27], and recently reproduced in the REPRESENTATIONS DSG tool on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server (BCS) [39­42].
For a group of bands that is separated from all of the other bands in the energy spectrum by an energy gap at each k point, one may attempt to inverseFourier-transform the bands into exponentially-localized Wannier orbitals in position space [Fig 1(a)]. If a group of bands can be inverse-Fourier transformed into exponentially-localized Wannier orbitals that respect the symmetries of the crystal SG, then the bands are termed Wannierizable [18, 28, 29]. As will be shortly discussed in Sec. II B, the absence of Wannierizability, or the properties of Wannier functions if successfully computed, are central to identification of nontrivial band topology.
B. Diagnosing Band Topology
From a mathematical perspective, the properties of an object are considered to be topological if the properties do not change as the object is smoothly deformed. In some cases, symmetry-protected topological properties may also be defined by restricting consideration to objects and deformations that respect a given set of symmetries. Just under 40 years ago [76­78], it was discov-

ered that, remarkably, the Bloch wavefunctions of energetically isolated bands in crystalline solids can carry topologically quantized numbers ­ known as topological invariants ­ that correspond to experimentally measurable quantized response effects [43]. The computation of topological invariants has allowed researchers to predict identically quantized responses in seemingly disparate solid-state materials, as well as in highly-simplified theoretical models. This is perhaps unintuitive, because the dispersion of energetically isolated bands in a material is free to change under doping, strain, or in the presence of weak disorder. Hence, one might expect little correspondence between the generic properties of simple models and those of real chemical compounds. However if the band distortion and interactions do not close a gap or break a symmetry, then the topology of the isolated bands cannot change. Because topology and symmetry alone indicate the numbers and locations of boundary states and the quantized values of bulk response coefficients in many solid-state materials, then topological phenomena can in fact be meaningfully predicted using appropriately simplified models.
Originally, nontrivial band topology was considered in the context of bulk-insulating systems [76­78]. However, the only requirement for unambiguously diagnosing the topology of a group of bands is that the bulk bands be energetically separated from the other bands in the spectrum at each momentum (i.e. a direct gap at each k point); an insulating, indirect gap at a particular EF is not a prerequisite for nontrivial band topology. Hence, as first emphasized by Fu and Kane in establishing the nontrivial band topology of metallic antimony [ICSD 426972, SG 166 (R¯3m)] [79], it is also possible to classify metallic materials as topological band insulators. In this review, we specifically define a band insulator to be a material with Ne electrons per unit cell in which the Ne lowestenergy Bloch eigenstates at each k point are separated from all higher-energy Bloch eigenstates at k by a gap. Therefore in this review, we will employ the definition established in [79] in which a material is classified as a TI or a TCI if the lowest Ne bands in energy are as a set topological, even if there are bulk electron or hole Fermi pockets.
Heuristically, there are three broad classes of topological bands in solid-state materials: obstructed atomic limits, fragile bands, and stable topological bands. First, in obstructed atomic limits, the isolated bands are Wannierizable, but the Wannier centers reside at positions in the unit cell away from the underlying atomic ions. Consequently, obstructed atomic limits exhibit electric multipole moments [29, 80], and boundaries between atomic limits and obstructed atomic limits exhibit either 0D or flat-band-like topological solitons with fractional charge or spin-charge separation [81]. In 1D, Wannier functions are always exponentially localized [82] in the absence of superconductivity [83], and hence, all topological phases are obstructed atomic limits. However in 2D and 3D, one must be more careful in constructing Wannier functions,

FIG. 2. Experimentally verified topological response effects in topological materials. Notable examples include the quantum Hall effect [43], the anomalous Hall effect [44­46], the anomalous Nernst effect [24, 47­50], the chiral anomaly [51­59], the gravitational anomaly [60, 61], the photogalvanic effect [62­68], and topologically-enhanced catalysis [10­12]. In 3D solid-state materials, experimental signatures of topological response effects are frequently bolstered by the concurrent observation of topological surface states in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) [69, 70] and scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM) [71­75] probes.

as topological bands in 2D and 3D may admit a localized position-space description with power-law decaying tails, as opposed to the exponential decay required for Wannierizability [84­86]. Topologically quantized charge and spin on domain walls between atomic limits were first identified in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) [87, 88] and Rice-Mele [89] models of polyacetylene. In the SSH model, there are two insulating regimes whose occupied bands differ by a  Berry [30] phase ­ equivalently termed a Zak [31] phase ­ that indicates the relative positions of the occupied Wannier orbitals [29, 80] [Fig. 1(a)].
More recently, the polarization topology of obstructed atomic limits was extended to quadrupole and octupole moments through a formulation of nested Berry phase [86, 90­95]. First, for a set of occupied bands |uk at each point k in the first BZ, one may define a discretized Wilson loop matrix W1 as the product of the outer products of |uk and |uk+1 taken over a finite

mesh of k points in the first BZ (as well as a sewing
matrix V ) [32­35] ­ the total Berry phase 1 mod 2 of the occupied bands is then related to the Wilson loop ma-
trix by det[W1] = exp(i1) [Fig. 1(b)]. In this sense, the Wilson loop W1 represents the non-Abelian (many-band) generalization of the Berry phase [32­35, 84, 85, 96­
99]. It was recently recognized that because the eigen-
values of W1 form smooth and continuous bands, then a second, nested Wilson loop matrix W2 may be constructed by computing a perpendicular Wilson loop us-
ing the eigenstates of W1. Analogous to the relationship between the Berry phase 1 and W1, a nested Berry phase 2 can then be defined through the relation det[W2] = exp(i2) [86, 90­95]. The nested Berry phase 2 was first introduced to diagnose the topology of quantized quadrupole insulators (QIs), in which 2 = 0,  indicates whether a pair of Wannier orbitals occupy the
corner or the center of a 2D square lattice [90, 91, 93, 100].

5

Additionally, 3D obstructed atomic limits have recently been predicted in silicon crystals [ICSD 150530, SG 227 (F d¯3m)] [101] and in electrides including Y2C [ICSD 672345, SG 166 (R¯3m)] [102], Li12Al3Si4 [ICSD 39597, SG 220 (I¯43d)] [103], and Ca2As [ICSD 166865, SG 139 (I4/mmm)] [104, 105]. The theory of Topological Quantum Chemistry (TQC) [39, 40, 85, 106­109], which we will further detail in Sec. VI, is built upon the complete enumeration of atomic limits in the 230 nonmagnetic SGs. In this review, we will largely discuss the boundary states of obstructed atomic limits in the context of the flat-band-like surface and hinge states of TSMs in Secs. V and VII, respectively.
It was also recently discovered [85, 106, 110­113] that in some cases, a group of bands exhibits boundary solitons [86, 93, 94, 114­117], but does not admit a Wannier description unless combined with other, trivial (Wannierizable) bands. These fragile topological bands have been shown to lie close to EF in hundreds of solid-state materials [16], and to be relevant to the low-energy excitations in twisted bilayer graphene [118­120], which we will further detail in Sec. IX.
The last class of bands ­ and the most ubiquitous (see [16] and Sec. VIII) ­ exhibit the stable topology of TIs and topological crystalline insulators (TCIs). Stable topological bands, unlike fragile bands or obstructed atomic limits, cannot be Wannierized, and remain nonWannierizable when combined with (obstructed) atomic limits or fragile bands. However, stable topological bands can generically be partially Fourier-transformed into hybrid Wannier functions with one coordinate r in position space perpendicular to two components k in momentum space [18, 28, 121­123]. As first discovered by Thouless, Kohomoto, Nightingale, and de Nijs [76­78] in the 1980's, in stable TIs and TCIs, the positions of the hybrid Wannier functions necessarily wind as functions of k . In a 2D quantum Hall phase considered in the limit of a rational flux quantum per unit cell such that there exists a 2D Bravais lattice of commuting (magnetic) translations [124], Thouless, Kohomoto, Nightingale, de Nijs, and other researchers [125] recognized that the hybrid-Wannier-center winding could be classified by an integer-valued topological invariant termed a Chern number. Crucially, the Chern number of a set of bands cannot be changed without closing a gap between the bands and other bands in the spectrum. Additionally, the Chern number of all of the occupied bands indicates the bulk Hall conductivity Hxy in the units of e2/h, as well as the number of topological chiral edge states.
After the discovery of the integer quantum Hall effect in 2D Chern insulators [43], a wide variety of topological response effects have subsequently been theoretically proposed and experimentally verified in systems with higher symmetry or dimensionality, including TIs and TCIs [Fig. 2]. Unlike in Chern insulators, the hybridWannier winding in TIs and TCIs ­ known as spectral flow because of its correspondence to the infinite "flowing" connectivity of topological boundary states [32] ­

is enforced by additional symmetries. Specifically, when combinations of spatial and T symmetries are relaxed in TIs and TCIs, the spectral flow may be removed (trivialized), and the bulk topology reduced to that of a fragile TI or an (obstructed) atomic limit. Though numerous, equivalent methods have been introduced to diagnose the topology of TIs and TCIs [1­3, 84, 96, 126­131], most methods cannot be generalized to realistic models of realmaterial band structures with varying symmetries, complicated dispersion, and large numbers of occupied bands. To date, the most consistently reliable and generalizable means of diagnosing single-particle band-topology is the Wilson loop method discussed earlier in this section [32­ 35, 84, 85, 96­99] [Fig. 1(b)]. When calculated over an energetically isolated set of bands in two or more dimensions, the Wilson loop eigenvalues indicate the k dependent locations r of the hybrid Wannier orbitals. Hence, the appearance of a winding Wilson spectrum either indicates stable spectral flow or fragile topology. As discussed earlier in this section, a nested Wilson loop method [86, 90­94] was also recently introduced to calculate higher-order (hinge) spectral flow in three or more dimensions, which we will further detail in Sec. VII.
Because the (nested) Wilson loop eigenvalues, when calculated over bands that are not fragile topological, correspond to the surface (hinge) spectrum of a crystal [32­ 35, 84­86, 90­94, 96­99], then Wilson-loop calculations have emerged as a highly accurate means of identifying and classifying the stable topology of real materials. Implementing the formulations in [32­34], researchers have released publicly available packages for calculating the Wilson loops of tight-binding models [132] and ab-initio electronic structures [122]. However, the Wilson-loop method has major drawbacks that largely prevent its automation in large-scale materials discovery. First, to compute the Wilson loop for a 3D material, one must calculate the occupied eigenstates on a 2D manifold of the BZ using a very dense mesh of k points, which is both memory- and processing-time-intensive. Second, because Wilson loops are path-dependent, then their implementation requires the manual input of a k-path specifically chosen to diagnose a particular topological phase. For example, to identify the glide-protected hourglass [97, 98] and fourfold Dirac [99] insulators in KHgSb [ICSD 56201, SG 194 (P 63/mmc)] and Sr2Pb3 [ICSD 648570, SG 127 (P 4/mbm)] respectively (see Sec. IV), the authors implemented a complicated, glide-resolved Wilson loop that bent along perpendicular planes in the BZ. A bent Wilson loop was also recently employed to identify Weyl TSM phases in materials with fourfold rotoinversion symmetry [133, 134] (see Secs. V A and IX).
Unlike (nested) Wilson loop calculations, symmetrybased indicators of band topology (SIs) [135­137], such as the Fu-Kane parity criterion [79], only require the determination of the eigenvalues of the occupied bands at high-symmetry BZ points, and are therefore computationally efficient and generalizable to large families of materials with the same symmetries. As more elaborate

6
ness has been demonstrated using network models [151­ 153] and renormalization group flow [154]. More recently, similar calculations were also performed to extract the critical conductance and correlation lengths of the Anderson localization transition in TIs and TCIs [155­160].

FIG. 3. 2D Topological insulators (TIs). (a) The KaneMele model of a 2D TI [1, 2] exhibits anomalous helical edge states whose crossing points are protected by time-reversal (T ) symmetry (reproduced with permission from [1]). (b) Resistance measurements from an HgTe quantum well [147] confirm the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) prediction [3] of a 2D TI phase with a helical pair of edge channels (reproduced with permission from [147]). In (b), the existence of counterpropagating helical edge modes was specifically confirmed by measuring a longitudinal conductance approaching G = 2e2/h in band-inverted devices (trend lines II, III, and IV), and a vanishing conductance in a thinner device with uninverted bands (trend line I). In quantum-well devices in the band-inverted regime, the role of T symmetry in protecting the gaplessness of the helical edge modes was additionally demonstrated by measuring a vanishing sample conductance in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field [147].
TI and TCI phases have been discovered, the set of FuKane-like SIs of stable topology has continued to grow. In Sec. VI, we will discuss how the discoveries of TQC and related methods were exploited to compute the complete SIs in the 230 nonmagnetic SGs [92, 138­143], and facilitated recent large-scale efforts to identify nonmagnetic topological materials [15, 16, 144­146] (see Sec.VIII).
It is important to emphasize that SIs generically provide an incomplete characterization of bulk topology. For example, the n-fold-rotation SIs introduced in [136] only specify the Z-valued Chern number up to the integer n. Additionally, there are large number of materials, such as noncentrosymmetric crystals, whose SGs do not carry eigenvalue indicators [139, 141]. Therefore, for many crystal structures and materials, the (nested) Wilson loop remains the only complete means of identifying the bulk topology. Recently for example, the higher-order TCI phases (see Sec. VII) of noncentrosymmetric -MoTe2 and -WTe2 crystals [ICSD 14348, SG 31 (P mn21)] were identified through the computation of a nested Wilson loop [94].
Lastly, topological material predictions are also reliable because topological robustness is an extensive property ­ the larger the size of the topological bulk of a system in real space, the more robust the bulk topology is to interactions and disorder that preserve the system symmetry on the average. This crucially allows topological response effects and boundary states in simplified models of pristine crystals to be generalized to real-material samples, which inevitably host inhomogeneities such as crystal defects, dopants, and reconstructed surface textures [23­ 25]. For Chern insulators, extensive topological robust-

III. THE FIRST TOPOLOGICAL INSULATORS
Over 20 years passed between the aforementioned characterization of Chern insulators and polyacetylene and the discovery of the first T -symmetric TIs. In a key intermediate step, Haldane in 1988 formulated a model of a Chern insulator in a crystal with a periodic ­ but netzero ­ magnetic field [44]. Like all Chern insulators, the Haldane model exhibits 1D chiral edge modes. In 2004, when constructing tight-binding models of graphene ­ a 2D carbon crystal with a honeycomb lattice [161], Kane and Mele formulated a model that, when the nearly vanishing effects of SOC are incorporated, reduces to two, time-reversed copies of the Haldane model. Hence, the Kane-Mele model exhibits helical edge modes [1] [Fig. 3(a)]. Crucially, Kane and Mele deduced that the edge modes were prevented from gapping by T symmetry [1, 2]. A more realistic formulation of 2D TIs in HgTe quantum wells was introduced shortly afterwards by Bernevig, Hughes, and Zhang (BHZ) [3], and was subsequently confirmed through transport measurements in [147] [Fig. 3(b)]. In [3], BHZ also crucially identified band inversion as a general mechanism for obtaining topological phases.
In both the Kane-Mele and BHZ models of 2D TI phases, the bulk topology can be deduced by a Z2 invariant that tracks the helical winding of the partial polarization, or the Berry phase per half of the occupied states [2, 96]. However in practice, the Kane-Mele Z2 invariant is exceedingly difficult to compute in realistic models, as it requires a careful treatment of matrix square roots and Pfaffians, as well as the computationally intensive process of determining, storing, and integrating the occupied states at each k point. Though a handful of calculations based on the Kane-Mele Pfaffian invariant have been employed to diagnose the topology of TI and TCI models [162, 163], the numerical prediction of TI and TCI phases in real materials without SIs (see Sec. VI) has primarily been accomplished through the equivalent Wilson-loop method introduced in [32­34] (see Sec. II B). Since the prediction by BHZ of 2D TI phases in HgTe quantum wells, 2D TI phases have subsequently been predicted and experimentally explored in monolayers of bismuth [162, 164­166] and the transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) MoS2 [167], and have been predicted and experimentally confirmed in monolayers of WTe2 [168­ 170] and Ta2Pd3Te5 [171, 172]. Notably, bismuth [138] and the TMDs MoTe2 and WTe2 [94, 145, 146] become higher-order TCIs with 1D helical hinge modes when stacked into 3D, as we will further discuss in Sec. VII.

The foundation for topological material discovery in 3D solid-state materials was most firmly established in 2006, when several independent groups predicted the existence of 3D TIs. In 3D TIs, the bulk topology is characterized by a 3D Z2 invariant, and each surface exhibits an unpaired (anomalous) twofold cone [79, 126, 149, 173, 174]. In particular, Fu and Kane crucially recognized that if a 3D TI is also symmetric under the exchange of spatial coordinates [i.e. under spatial inversion (I) or parity symmetry], then its Z2 invariant could simply be deduced from the bulk parity eigenvalues of the occupied bands at the T -invariant k (TRIM) points [79]. Because the integral formulation of the 3D Z2 invariant is even more mathematically and computationally intensive than its 2D counterpart [79, 126, 149], it provided little help towards predicting 3D TI phases in real materials. Conversely, the Fu-Kane parity criterion immediately provided a simple recipe for discovering centrosymmetric 3D TIs: generalizing the earlier link between TI phases and band inversion recognized by BHZ, Fu and Kane predicted 3D TI phases in insulating compounds with odd numbers of band inversions at TRIM points between bands with opposite parity eigenvalues. Fu, Kane, and Mele then specifically proposed a bandinversion-driven 3D TI in Bi1-xSbx alloys, whose characteristic anomalous surface states were shortly afterwards measured in experiment [148, 175] [Fig. 4(a)]. In the following years, more idealized 3D TI phases were identified in Bi2Se3 [ICSD 42545, SG 166 (R¯3m)], Bi2Te3 [ICSD 617192, SG 166 (R¯3m)], Sb2Te3 [ICSD 193346, SG 166 (R¯3m)], and Bi2-CaSe3 crystals [150, 176­180] [Fig. 4(b)]. While the above 3D TI phases were initially observed in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) probes [69, 70], anomalous Dirac-cone surface states in 3D TIs were subsequently confirmed through

quasiparticle interference (QPI) in scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments [71].
Lastly, concurrently with the prediction of 3D TIs, researchers also proposed the existence of weak 3D TIs (WTIs). From a theoretical perspective, WTIs can be deformed into position-space stacks of 2D TIs that contain one 2D TI layer in each stack unit cell, where the normal vector of each 2D TI layer is oriented along the (Z2,1x^ + Z2,2y^ + Z2,3z^)- [stacking] direction [79, 149, 173, 174]. The three Z2-valued indices Z2,i are termed the weak indices, and the stacking direction (Z2,1, Z2,2, Z2,3) is termed the weak-index vector. WTIs owe their name to the recognition that in samples with even numbers of layers, all of the 2D TI helical modes may be pairwise annihilated, rendering the WTI sample devoid of topological boundary states [185]. Hence, few-layer WTI samples are expected to exhibit a layer-dependent 2D QSH effect [79, 149, 173, 174, 185, 186]. WTI phases have been predicted and experimentally confirmed through ARPES probes in BiI [ICSD 1559, SG 12 (C2/m)] [187, 188] and strained ZrTe5 [ICSD 85507, SG 63 (Cmcm)] [189, 190]. A WTI phase was also engineered in a graphene-like layered structure of Bi14Rh3I9 [191], as confirmed through bulk ARPES probes [192] and STM experiments demonstrating the presence of step-edge helical modes [193].
IV. TOPOLOGICAL CRYSTALLINE INSULATORS
When searching for candidate 3D TIs, Fu and Kane initially suggested that Pb1-xSnxTe alloys exhibited a 3D TI phase separated by two equally trivial insulators: PbTe [ICSD 648585, SG 225 (F m¯3m)] and SnTe [ICSD 601065, SG 225 (F m¯3m)] [79]. However, it was quickly realized [181], and subsequently confirmed

through ARPES experiments [182] [Fig. 5(a,b)], that SnTe is in fact not a trivial insulator. Rather, SnTe was recognized to be a new variant of 3D TI ­ a 3D TCI ­ in which the Fu-Kane-Mele 3D Z2 invariant is trivial (see Sec. III), and the bulk stable topology is instead protected by mirror symmetry (as well as bulk fourfold rotation symmetry [92, 140, 194], as we will later discuss in Sec. VII). In SnTe, there are even numbers of twofold Dirac-cone surface states lying along surface lines of mirror symmetry [181]. More broadly, in TCIs, the bulk topology is enforced by specific combinations of unitary (e.g. mirror reflection) and antiunitary (e.g. T ) symmetries, and anomalous topological surface states manifest on crystal facets whose 2D symmetry (wallpaper) groups include the projections of the 3D symmetries that protect the bulk topology [99, 195, 196].
After the discovery of mirror TCIs, researchers next proposed nonsymmorphic TCI phases protected by bulk glide reflection [97­99, 197, 198]. In magnetic M¨obius TCIs [197, 198], unpaired Dirac-cone surface states ­ like those of 3D TIs ­ appear along surface glide lines. In T -symmetric hourglass TCIs [97­99] ­ which are topo-

logically equivalent to time-reversed, superposed pairs of M¨obius TCIs ­ the surface bands cross in hourglass-like connectivities along surface glide lines, forming pairs of twofold Dirac cones [Fig. 5(c)]. Most recently, an exotic, nonsymmorphic Dirac insulator phase with an anomalous fourfold surface Dirac cone ­ twice the degeneracy of a 3D TI surface state [Fig. 4] ­ was proposed in crystals with two perpendicular, surface-projecting glide planes [99]. An hourglass TCI phase was predicted [97, 98] and incipiently confirmed through ARPES [183] and quantum oscillations [184] in KHgSb [ICSD 56201, SG 194 (P 63/mmc)] [Fig. 5(c,d)]. Shortly afterwards, an hourglass TCI phase was also predicted in Ba5In2Sb6 [ICSD 62305, SG 55 (P bam)] [Fig. 5(f)], and a nonsymmorphic Dirac TCI phase was predicted in Sr2Pb3 [ICSD 648570, SG 127 (P 4/mbm)] [Fig. 5(e)] [99]. From a bulk perspective, it is important to note that while centrosymmetric mirror TCIs may be identified through SIs [136, 139, 141, 142] (see Sec. VI), nonsymmorphic TCIs may only be identified by performing a Wilson loop or equivalent calculation [97­99, 141, 197, 198] (see Sec. II B).

9

Recently, researchers have also discovered the existence of 3D higher-order TCIs (HOTIs) [further discussed in Sec. VII], which are characterized by gapless 1D hinge states that sometimes coexist with 2D surface Dirac cones. Specifically, although the lowest-symmetry HOTI models exhibit gapped 2D surfaces and gapless 1D hinges [94, 139, 141, 142], typical solid-state HOTIs have additional crystal symmetries that can protect gapless 2D surface states. Hence, classifying a typical solid-state TCI as a HOTI or as a first-order TCI is in practice a matter of preference ­ depending on the sample termination, the same crystal may exhibit topological surface states or gapped facets separated by topological hinge states. For example, the first observed mirror TCI ­ SnTe ­ has recently been reclassified as a HOTI [15, 92, 141, 144­146]. Specifically, when bulk or surface mirror symmetry is relaxed in SnTe by strain or sample termination while preserving fourfold rotation symmetry, the surface states are no longer protected by mirror symmetry (though some surface states remain protected by the product of twofold rotation and T symmetry [194]). In SnTe samples with broken mirror symmetry, the hinges between facets with gapped surface states are predicted to bind 1D helical modes [92, 140, 141, 194]. Furthermore, first-principles calculations have suggested that PbTe [ICSD 648588, SG 225 (F m¯3m)] ­ which is isostructural to SnTe ­ may also realize TCI and HOTI phases depending on sample quality and preparation details [15, 144­146, 199]. Lastly, as discussed in [94, 99, 200, 201], other TCIs ­ most notably including the nonsymmorphic Dirac TCI ­ also represent the parent phases of HOTIs with helical hinge states.
V. TOPOLOGICAL SEMIMETALS
Historically, the term semimetal has been used to describe solid-state materials in which there is a small but nonzero density of states at EF [23]. However, there are two distinct mechanisms of realizing a semimetallic density of states. First, such as in the archetypal semimetal bismuth [ICSD 64703, SG 166 (R¯3m)] [202], there is a gap at all k points, but the system remains metallic due to a negative indirect gap. As emphasized by Fu and Kane [79], bismuth-like semimetals may still exhibit nontrivial band topology due to the presence of an energy gap between the valence and conduction manifolds at all k points. Hence in more modern literature, semimetals like bismuth are referenced as band insulators. In recent years, bismuth itself was in fact recognized to be a higher-order topological crystalline band insulator [138], as we will further discuss in Sec. VII.
A semimetallic density of states also occurs in crystalline solids in which the bulk bands meet at EF in only a handful of nodal points, but are otherwise separated by an energy gap. Such systems are termed nodal semimetals. The prototypical 2D nodal semimetal phase occurs in graphene, in which the spin-degenerate bands meet

in only two, linearly dispersing points [161, 203­205]. If the bands in a d-dimensional [d-D] nodal semimetal exhibit nontrivial (d - 1)-D or (d - 2)-D polarization, fragile, or stable topology [see Sec. II B], then the nodal semimetal is further classified as a topological semimetal [TSM]. For example in zigzag-terminated graphene, the edge k points between the projections of the bulk nodal points exhibit nearly-flat bands enforced by bulk polarization topology [206­209]; hence, graphene is the simplest TSM. Because the low-energy mathematical description of the nodal points in graphene (i.e. the k · p Hamiltonian) resembles the Dirac equation for relativistic particles [204, 205], the nodal points were termed 2D Dirac points. As we will discuss below in Sec. V A, in 3D TSMs, there exist bulk nodal degeneracies whose k · p Hamiltonians resemble the high-energy Dirac and Weyl equations; hence, in these 3D TSMs, the nodal points are respectively termed 3D Dirac and Weyl points. Initially, the search for TSMs and TIs was motivated as an effort to observe condensed-matter realizations of highenergy phenomena. For example, the surface states of 3D TIs are unpaired twofold Dirac cones (see Sec. III) ­ representing half of the degeneracy of each of the Dirac points in graphene [79, 126, 149, 175, 210]. However, as we will discuss in Sec. V B, researchers have since discovered numerous 3D solid-state TSMs in which the nodal degeneracies at EF are neither Dirac nor Weyl fermions.
A. Dirac and Weyl Semimetals
For a time, the analogy between solid-state and highenergy physics held relatively well in 3D semimetals. Searching for 3D generalizations of graphene, researchers identified 3D Dirac semimetals through two, parallel tracks. First, researchers recognized that nodal fermions at high-symmetry k points transform in small coreps of the little group Gk [211, 212] (see Sec. II A). Because the small coreps of the little groups in all 230 nonmagnetic SGs were previously enumerated in [27], it was possible to target specific k points in specific SGs for highsymmetry-point, essential 3D Dirac fermions ­ fourfold degeneracies with linear dispersion in all three directions that transform in four-dimensional, double-valued small coreps at high-symmetry BZ points. More broadly, essential nodal points were recognized to be features of the minimal band connectivity in each SG, and can also lie along high-symmetry lines and planes in nonsymmorphic and non-primitive SGs [213­215]. Searching for highsymmetry-point, essential Dirac fermions, researchers theoretically predicted 3D Dirac semimetal phases in hypothetical, metastable structural phases of the BiO2 [212] and BiZnSiO4 families [216]. Unfortunately however, the structural phases of BiO2 and BiZnSiO4 highlighted in [212, 216] have thus far proved to be experimentally inaccessible. Neverthelesss, high-symmetry-point, essential nodal fermions have since been discovered in a wealth of readily accessible materials, validating the methods

10

introduced in [211, 212]. Furthermore, [212, 216] represented some of the earliest attempts at combining crystalline group theory and material databases for topological materials discovery, laying the foundation for the large-scale material discovery efforts that we will discuss in Sec. VIII.
Concurrently with the search for high-symmetrypoint, essential 3D Dirac fermions, other teams focused on band-inversion 3D Dirac fermions. Unlike highsymmetry-point Dirac fermions, band-inversion 3D Dirac fermions are defined as fourfould degeneracies with linear dispersion in all three directions that form at the crossing points between two, twofold-degenerate bands that transform in different small coreps of a little group along a high-symmetry BZ line or plane. In bandinversion semimetals, unlike essential, high-symmetryline or plane semimetals, the nodal points at EF are not required to be present in the minimal band connectivity, and are instead pairwise nucleated by band inversion. Searching for compounds in which the bulk bands were strongly inverted along axes of four- or six-fold rotation, researchers predicted band-inversion 3D Dirac semimetal phases in Cd3As2 [ICSD 609930, SG 137 (P 42/nmc)] [217] and Na3Bi [ICSD 26881, SG 194 (P 63/mmc)] [218], which were concurrently confirmed in ARPES experiments [219­222]. Tilted (typeII) variants of band-inversion Dirac TSM phases have also been proposed in the VAl3 [ICSD 167811, SG 139 (I4/mmm)] [223] and YPd2Sn [ICSD 105699, SG 225 (F m¯3m)] [224] material families, and observed in PtTe2 [ICSD 649753, SG 164 (P ¯3m1)] through ARPES experiments [225].
During their initial characterization, the designation of Dirac semimetals as TSMs was controversial. Specifically, on the one hand, it was recognized that Dirac semimetals could exhibit arc-like surface states [226­229], and that the same band inversions that create Dirac points can also result in high-symmetry BZ planes exhibiting the same stable bulk topology and surface states as 2D TIs and TCIs [230]. Indeed, arc-like surface states were experimentally observed in Dirac semimetal phases in Cd3As2, Na3Bi, and PtSn4 [ICSD 54609, SG 68 (Ccce)] through ARPES [226, 227, 231], quantum oscillations [228, 232], and QPI in STM [233, 234]. However, it was also recognized that the arc-like states were not topological [235], and that not all Dirac semimetals are required to exhibit surface states [236, 237]. Recently, it was discovered that large families of Dirac semimetals, including Cd3As2, exhibit higher-order hinge states as a direct topological consequence of their bulk Dirac points (see Sec. VII), definitely resolving the status of Dirac semimetals as TSMs [93].
In addition to 3D Dirac fermions, researchers also discovered solid-state realizations of conventional Weyl fermions ­ defined as twofold degeneracies with linear dispersion in all three directions [238­240]. Unlike Dirac fermions, conventional Weyl fermions carry a nontrivial topological invariant in the absence of symmetry ­ the

Chern number |C| = 1 evaluated on a sphere around the Weyl point (also known as the chiral charge of the Weyl point) ­ and hence can form at any point in the BZ of a crystal with singly-degenerate bands, even if the crossing bands are labeled with the same small coreps. More generally, Weyl points are condensed-matter realizations of chiral fermions ­ nodal degeneracies with nontrivial, Zvalued monopole (chiral) charges reflecting the difference in the Chern number evaluated in 2D BZ planes above and below the chiral fermion. On the 2D facets of finite crystals with Weyl points at EF , the projections of BZ planes with nontrivial Chern numbers host topological surface Fermi arcs that span the projections of the bulk chiral fermions [239]. A conventional Weyl semimetal is therefore the simplest variant of a chiral TSM ­ a gapless phase of matter in which some or all of the bulk Fermi pockets carry nontrivial chiral charges. Chiral TSMs can hence be contrasted with achiral TSMs ­ such as Dirac semimetals ­ in which none of the bulk Fermi pockets originate from chiral fermions with uncompensated chiral charges.
The first Weyl semimetals were predicted in magnetic phases of the pyrochlore iridates like Y2Ir2O7 [ICSD 187534, SG 227 (F d¯3m)] [239], though Weyl points have not yet been observed in these materials. Shortly after the discovery of 3D Dirac semimetals, band-inversion Weyl-semimetal phases were then predicted [241, 242] and experimentally confirmed through ARPES [243­245] and QPI in STM [73] in the transition-metal monophosphides TaAs [ICSD 611451, SG 109 (I41md)], TaP [ICSD 648185, SG 109 (I41md)], NbAs [ICSD 16585, SG 109 (I41md)], and NbP [ICSD 81493, SG 109 (I41md)]. Type-II (tilted) Weyl points were also predicted to lie near EF in the noncentrosymmetric, isostructural TMDs -WTe2 [ICSD 14348, SG 31 (P mn21)] [246] and MoTe2 [247], though later research [94] has suggested that 3D TMDs may also be HOTIs (see Sec. VII). Higher-charge Weyl points stabilized by rotation symmetries have additionally been proposed in SrSi2 [ICSD 24145, SG 212 (P 4332)] [248], NbSi2 [ICSD 601659, SG 180 (P 6222)] [249], and in the ferromagnetic phase of HgCr2Se4 [ICSD 626175, SG 227 (F d¯3m)] [250, 251].
Though most Weyl points near EF in solid-state materials arise from band inversion, researchers have also recently predicted essential Kramers-Weyl points pinned to TRIM and other high-symmetry points in structurally chiral crystals with relevant SOC [254, 261], where structural chirality is defined through the absence of rotoinversion symmetries such as mirror or I [26] (see Sec. V B for further details). Unlike band-inversion Weyl points, Kramers-Weyl points are formed from two Bloch states at a momentum k that transform in a two-dimensional, double-valued small corep of a chiral little group Gk (see Sec. II A and [254]). Kramers-Weyl points have since been predicted in Ag2Se0.3Te0.7 [254], and have been experimentally investigated in chiral tellurium [ICSD 23062, SG 152 (P 3121)] through ARPES [262] and in -Ag2Se [ICSD 260148, SG 19 (P 212121)] [263] and

few-layer chiral tellurium [264] through quantum oscillations. A complete enumeration of the single-valued coreps corresponding to weak-SOC variants of KramersWeyl points was also recently performed in [265]. Lastly, Weyl semimetals have emerged as a playground for topological bulk response effects [Fig. 2], with the transitionmetal monophosphides TaAs and NbP and the halfHeusler GdPtBi [ICSD 58786, SG 216 (F ¯43m)] in an external magnetic field in particular providing platforms for the observation of the gravitational anomaly [60, 61] and the chiral anomaly [51­57, 59].
B. Unconventional TSMs and Chiral Crystals
Following the initial characterization of Dirac and Weyl semimetals, researchers over the last five years have recognized the existence of increasingly exotic variants of unconventional TSMs without analogs in highenergy physics, including closed rings of nodal points ­ known as nodal lines [266­268] ­ and nodal points whose k · p Hamiltonians do not resemble the dispersion relations of familiar relativistic particles [252, 253]. In many 3D nodal-line semimetals, the surface projections of the nodal lines are filled with 2D puddles of topological, flat-

band-like drumhead surface states that originate from a  shift in the bulk polarization density (surface-directed Berry phase, see Sec. II B) between the interior and exterior of the nodal line [266, 267]. Nodal-line TSMs with drumhead surface states have since been proposed in an overwhelming number of solid-state materials [213, 266­ 271], and have been experimentally investigated in numerous compounds including Ca3P2 in a novel structural phase through X-ray diffraction [272]; ZrSiS [ICSD 15569, SG 129 (P 4/nmm)] [273, 274], CaAgAs [ICSD 10017, SG 189 (P ¯62m)] [275], PbTaSe2 [ICSD 74704, SG 187 (P ¯6m2)] [276], and ZrB2 [ICSD 615755, SG 191 (P 6/mmm)] [277] through ARPES; NbAs2 [ICSD 81218, SG 12 (C2/m)] [278] through optical conductivity measurements; and in ZrSiSe [ICSD 15571, SG 129 (P 4/nmm)] through QPI in STM [279].
Next, beginning with the prediction of eightfold double Dirac points in materials including Bi2AuO5 [ICSD 82092, SG 130 (P 4/ncc)] [252] and CuBi2O4 [ICSD 56390, SG 130 (P 4/ncc)] [253] (though the latter would prove to be a Mott insulator due to interactions [280, 281]), researchers also identified unconventional nodal point semimetals that lie between or beyond the earlier Dirac and Weyl classification schemes [Fig. 6(a,b)]. Examples include the band-inversion, partially dispers-

12

ing threefold points predicted in -TaN [ICSD 76455, SG 187 (P ¯6m2)] [282] and the WC family [ICSD 672362, SG 187 (P ¯6m2)] [283, 284] and confirmed through ARPES in MoP [ICSD 644091, SG 187 (P ¯6m2)] [285] and WC [286], the coexisting Dirac and Weyl points predicted in the SrHgPb family [ICSD 602710, SG 186 (P 63mc)] [287], and the achiral sixfold fermions observed in PdSb2 [ICSD 77109, SG 205 (P a¯3)] through ARPES experiments [288]. In the aforementioned band-inversion threefold point and mixed Dirac-Weyl TSMs, the nontrivial bulk stable topology and topological surface states originate from a combination of band inversion and chiral-fermion (Weylpoint) descent relations, but are not directly related to the bulk threefold and Dirac points themselves [289]. High-symmetry-point sixfold fermions were also predicted to lie near EF in CoSi [ICSD 260982, SG 198 (P 213)] and AlPt [ICSD 672522, SG 198 (P 213)] [253].
Most notably, great recent advances in TSMs have come from identifying conventional and unconventional nodal degeneracies in structurally chiral crystals. Specifically, in [254] it was shown that all point-like degeneracies in structurally chiral crystals necessarily exhibit nontrivial chiral charges, implying that all nodal-point TSMs with structurally chiral SGs are topologically chiral TSMs (i.e. TSM phases in which bulk Fermi pockets carry nontrivial chiral charges, see Sec. V A for further details). This led to the ab-initio prediction [255, 256] that members of the RhSi (B20) chiral crystal family [ICSD 79233, SG 198 (P 213)] ­ including the aforementioned examples of CoSi and AlPt highlighted in [253] ­ host surface-BZ-spanning topological Fermi arcs linking the projections of essential, high-symmetry-point, unconventional, chiral fermions [Fig. 6(c)]. Zone-spanning surface Fermi arcs were subsequently observed in ARPES probes of CoSi [257­259] [Fig. 6(d)] and AlPt [290], and through QPI in STM probes of CoSi [291]. After [257­ 259, 290], BZ-spanning topological surface Fermi arcs were observed through ARPES in numerous other topological chiral crystals, including PdGa [ICSD 261111, SG 198 (P 213)] [260] [Fig. 6(e)], PtGa [ICSD 635132, SG 198 (P 213)] [292], RhSn [ICSD 650381, SG 198 (P 213)] [293], and PdBiSe [ICSD 616956, SG 198 (P 213)] [294]. Lastly, chiral TSM phases in structurally chiral crystals have also been recognized as ideal systems for experimentally probing topological response effects ­ structurally chiral TSMs have been theoretically proposed as venues for realizing topological superconductivity [295, 296], and recent experiments have demonstrated a nearly-quantized circular photogalvanic effect [63, 64, 254, 255, 297] in RhSi [67] and CoSi [68]; quantum-oscillation signatures of topological superconductivity in AuBe [ICSD 58396, SG 198 (P 213)] [298]; and high-efficiency and enantioselective catalysis in AlPt, PtGa, and PdGa [11, 12].

VI. TQC AND SYMMETRY-BASED INDICATORS
As discussed in Sec. II B, if a set of bands is not Wannierizable, then the bands are either stable or fragile topological. In 2017, researchers exploited this reasoning to formulate the theory of TQC [39, 40, 85, 106­109] as a means of predicting the k-space topology of a material from its r-space chemistry. In TQC, the bands of (obstructed) atomic limits transform in band representations that are induced from Wannier orbitals that in turn transform in the coreps of the site-symmetry groups {Gq} of a crystal. Specifically, each Gq is defined as the group of symmetries that return the point q to itself in the same unit cell. TQC is based on the statement that in any SG, the bands of any (obstructed) atomic limit transform in a linear combination of elementary band representations (EBRs) ­ defined as the band representations that cannot be expressed as direct sums of other band representations [40, 109, 299, 300]. The EBRs of all 230 nonmagnetic SGs were made available for TQC through the BANDREP tool on the BCS [39, 40]. Importantly, each EBR is not just a collection of small coreps at each high-symmetry k point, but also includes the (nested) Berry phases that encode the relative positions of the underlying atomic orbitals [85, 86, 93, 106, 107] (see Sec. II B). Because the bands that transform in EBRs span the set of Wannierizable bands in each SG, then any energetically isolated set of bands that does not transform in a band representation must be stable or fragile topological.
As recognized in [79, 135, 136], the presence of some stable topological phases, such as Chern insulators and 3D TIs, can be inferred from the symmetry eigenvalues of the occupied bands. By exploiting an enumeration of (obstructed) atomic limits equivalent to TQC, the authors of [137, 139, 140, 143] developed a method for identifying the linearly independent SI groups (e.g. Z4 × Z32) and SI formulas (e.g. the Fu-Kane parity criterion [79], see Sec. II B) for stable topology in each SG. In the method introduced in [137, 139, 140], the SIs of an SG are determined by solving a set of Diophantine equations using the Smith-normal form [318] of the matrix of small corep multiplicities of each EBR [302­305]. The procedure returns a set of SI topological bands that cannot be expressed as integer-valued linear combinations of EBRs, and are hence stable topological (see Sec. II B). From the SI topological bands, one may then obtain the SI groups and formulas of each SG in an arbitrary basis in which nontrivial SIs generically indicate superpositions of recognizable TIs and TCIs. In [139], the authors computed the SI groups for the 230 SGs. Shorty afterwords, the authors of [140­143] determined equivalent, intuitive bases and the associated anomalous boundary states for each stable SI formula. As we will later discuss in Sec. VII, the SI formulas in [139, 141, 142] revealed the existence of numerous symmetry-indicated HOTI phases, which included the HOTIs first identified in [92, 138]. SIs for

FIG. 7. Higher-order TCIs. (a) The classification of nth-order TIs and TCIs in d-dimensions introduced in [91, 92]. In the classification scheme in (a), dth-order TCIs in d-dimensions exhibit anomalous boundary charge and spin that manifest as midgap 0D states near the chiral-symmetric limit. Hence, dth-order TCIs in d-dimensions ­ like the 2D quantized quadrupole insulator (QI) in [90] ­ are necessarily fragile topological or obstructed atomic limits [86, 93, 94]. We emphasize that in most 3D solid-state TCIs with 1D hinge states like SnTe [92] and bismuth crystals [138, 301] [bottom-left inset panel in (a)], there also exist anomalous 2D surface states [86, 99, 141, 142, 194]. Nevertheless, whether a material is interpreted to be a TCI or a higherorder TCI (HOTI), the classification of the bulk topology can unambiguously be determined through SIs [137, 139­143, 302­305] (Sec. VI), (nested) Wilson loops [32­35, 84­86, 90­94, 96­99] (see Sec. II B), and layer constructions [141, 306, 307]. (b) The simplest 3D HOTIs can be constructed from I- and T -symmetric 3D TIs (Fig. 4). First, applying I-symmetric magnetism to an I- and T -symmetric 3D TI gaps the twofold Dirac-cone surface states to reveal the intrinsic chiral hinge modes of a magnetic axion insulator (AXI) [79, 86, 94, 123, 126, 149, 308­317]. Alternatively, superposing two I- and T -symmetric 3D TIs results in a non-axionic 3D HOTI phase in which unstable fourfold surface Dirac cones [94, 99] gap into a network of intrinsic helical hinge modes [138, 139, 141, 142].

fragile topological bands [85, 106, 110, 111] (see Sec. II B) were also recently introduced in [112, 113]. Using the SIs in the 230 nonmagnetic SGs, large databases of topological materials were subsequently generated in [15, 16, 144­ 146] (see Sec. VIII).
VII. HIGHER-ORDER TCIS AND TSMS
In 2015, a revolution in topological materials was initiated by the introduction of a model of a 2D QI with gapped 1D edges and anomalous, fractionally-charged 0D corner states [90] [Fig. 7(a)]. Though earlier works had demonstrated that d-D topological phases could host (d - 2)-D topological modes [252, 312, 319­322], the QI model introduced in [90] was the first model in which the presence of (d - 2)-D boundary states was recognized to be an intrinsic topological consequence of the d-D bulk. Shortly after [90], several works [91, 92, 99, 138, 140, 194, 314, 323, 324] demonstrated the existence of 3D HOTI phases with intrinsic 1D chiral or helical hinge states [Fig. 7(b)]. In particular, as we will shortly discuss, the authors of [138] used TQC to predict that rhombohedral bismuth crystals [ICSD 64703, SG 166 (R¯3m)], which exhibit trivial Fu-Kane parity indices (see Sec. III), are in fact HOTIs with helical hinge states.
The complete SIs of the 230 nonmagnetic SGs (see Sec. VI) were computed in [139, 141, 142], initially on a parallel research track to the HOTI models introduced

in [90, 91]. However in [139, 141, 142], the authors uncovered instances of models and real materials with trivial Fu-Kane parity [79] and rotation-indicated TCI indices [136], but whose occupied bands nevertheless exhibited nontrivial stable SIs. The authors quickly recognized that the new TCI phases generically exhibited combinations of 2D surface states and 1D hinge modes, and included the HOTI phases proposed in [92, 140]. The simplest symmetry-indicated HOTI ­ a doubled "3D TI" ­ occurs in SG 2 (P ¯1), and is formed from two superposed copies of an I- and T -symmetric 3D TI [Fig. 7(b)]. From a physical perspective, doubled 3D TI phases occur in centrosymmetric materials with a double band inversion at the same TRIM point [92, 94]. This realization motivated promoting the Z2 Fu-Kane parity criterion to a Z4 index for I- and T -symmetric insulators [92, 94, 139, 141, 142], coinciding with the Z4-valued SI Z4 that results from performing the Smith-normal form calculation outlined in Sec. VI for SG 2 (P ¯1). In a concurrent work, however, it was shown that the fourfold Dirac surface states of the new phase ­ the Z4 = 2 doubled 3D TI ­ are unstable, given the wallpaper group symmetries of a crystal in SG 2 (P ¯1) [99]. In rapid succession, several groups [138, 141, 142] determined that when a doubled 3D TI is cut in an I-symmetric geometry, the mass of the surface fourfold Dirac cone has opposite signs on surfaces with I-related Miller indices, resulting in a network of sample encircling, intrinsic, helical hinge modes [Fig. 7(b)].

14

Using the topological invariants introduced in [92], a fourfold-rotation-anomaly HOTI phase [140, 194] was first predicted in strained SnTe [ICSD 601065, SG 225 (F m¯3m)]. Shortly afterwards, using SIs, TQC, and reinterpreting earlier data from STM [165] and superconducting transport experiments [325], the existence of a Z4 = 2 HOTI phase with helical 1D channels was theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed in rhombohedral bismuth crystals [138]. Though subsequent works [326, 327] have provided alternative interpretations for the STM data in [138, 165], bismuth-like supercurrent oscillations have since been observed in other candidate HOTIs [94], including MoTe2 [ICSD 14349, SG 11 (P 21/m)] [328] and WTe2 [ICSD 14348, SG 31 (P mn21)] [329­331]. Additionally, hinge-state-like 1D channels have been observed in STM probes of MoTe2 samples with coexisting structural orders [332] and in spectroscopic probes [333­335] of the candidate HOTI BiBr [ICSD 1560, SG 12 (C2/m)] [146, 336, 337]. Notably, while the HOTI phases in bismuth, -MoTe2, and BiBr are indicated by Z4 = 2 [146, 336, 337], the HOTI phases in noncentrosymmetric -MoTe2 and -WTe2 can only be diagnosed by computing a nested Wilson loop [94] (see Sec. II B).
The discovery of HOTIs also resolved previous ambiguities in the characterization of magnetically doped 3D TIs. It had been known since the identification of the first 3D TIs that breaking T symmetry can drive a 3D TI into an axion insulating (AXI) phase with gapped bulk and surface states and gapless (chiral) hinge modes [79, 126, 149, 308­313, 315]. AXIs inherit their name from early work by Wilczek [338] and Witten [339] on high-energy field theories that exhibit axion electrodynamics as a consequence of incorporating magnetic monopoles. Signatures of axion electrodynamics were recently observed in terahertz spectroscopy probes of the 3D TI Bi2Se3 [ICSD 42545, SG 166 (R¯3m)] in an external magnetic field [340]. Through a combination of magnetic SIs [139, 302, 303, 314, 316] and boundary-state calculations [86, 94, 315, 317] of magnetically gapped, I-symmetric TIs, it was revealed that AXIs are in fact magnetic HOTIs with intrinsic hinge states [Fig. 7(b)]. While the bulk topology of an I-symmetric AXI may be inferred from the Fu-Kane parity formula [308, 309, 311], all of the surface states and Wilson loops are generically gapped in an AXI with only bulk I symmetry, and the nontrivial bulk topology manifests as chiral spectral flow in the hinge and nested Wilson spectra [86] (see Sec. II B). Notably, there also exist AXI phases protected by bulk symmetries other than I ­ such the product of twofold rotation and T ­ in which the bulk topology cannot be diagnosed from SIs, and is only indicated by (nested) Wilson loop winding [86, 123, 317]. AXI phases have been proposed in Sm-doped Bi2Se3 [341] and MnBi2Te4 [ICSD 425966, SG 166 (R¯3m)] [342, 343], and experimental signatures of AXIs have been observed in transport and ARPES probes of Cr- and V-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 heterostructures [344, 345] and in MnBi2Te4 [346, 347].

Lastly, by using TQC to re-express the original QI model in [90] as a magnetic obstructed atomic limit formed from s-d-orbital hybridization, researchers in [93] discovered the existence of solid-state higher-order TSM (HOTSM) phases with flat-band-like hinge states. In Dirac HOTSMs, there may or may not also exist topologically trivial Fermi-arc surface states (see Sec. V A); nevertheless, Dirac HOTSMs universally host intrinsic hinge states as a topological consequence of their bulk Dirac points [93, 348]. Dirac HOTSM phases have since been predicted to occur in nearly all previously identified band-inversion Dirac semimetals [93], and signatures of hinge states were recently observed in supercurrent oscillation experiments on the established Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 [ICSD 609930, SG 137 (P 42/nmc)] [349] (see Sec. V A). Most recently, researchers have also predicted the existence of nodal-line [94, 350], Weyl [351], and sixfold-point [103] HOTSMs. In HOTSM materials like Cd3As2, the bulk nodal degeneracies are equivalent to the quantum critical points between 2D insulators that differ by a quantized nested Berry phase (see Sec. II B), and the flat-band-like hinge states hence originate from higherorder-topological descent relations [93, 94, 348, 351].
VIII. THE TOPOLOGICAL MATERIALS DATABASE
TQC [39, 40, 85, 106­109] and related methods [137, 139, 141, 142] have changed the mindset of the topological materials community from materials discovery ­ relying primarily on human intuition ­ to algorithmic materials prediction. Specifically, TQC has allowed the methods first introduced in [211­ 213, 215, 252, 253] for predicting enforced semimetals and [79, 136] for predicting TIs and TCIs to be implemented for high-throughput topological materials discovery. Exploiting the complete enumeration of symmetry-indicated TIs (Sec. III), TCIs (Sec. IV), TSM phases (Sec. V), HOTIs and HOTSMs (Sec. VII), and atomic limits [EBRs] (Sec. VI) developed over the past decade, researchers over the past two years have successfully performed the first large-scale searches for topological materials. Utilizing the ICSD [13, 14] and the Materials Project [355], researchers applied the theories of TQC [39, 40, 85, 106­109] and SIs [137, 139, 141, 142] to the automated output of thousands of first-principles investigations of nonmagnetic chemical compounds, resulting in massive databases of stoichiometric topological materials [15, 144­146]. Specifically, in [15, 144, 145], the authors respectively performed density functional theory [356, 357] calculations on 25,000, 40,000, and 20,000 of the 193,426 material structures entered in the ICSD after applying filters to remove alloys and entries with large numbers of atoms per unit cell or heavy elements (e.g. elements with f electrons at EF ). In [15, 144] in particular, the authors identified 8,000 ICSD entries

FIG. 8. Representative materials with novel topological properties identified in [16]. (a) The layered transition-metal chalco-
genide Ta2NiSe5 [ICSD 61148, SG 15 (C2/c)] was measured in earlier transport experiments to be an exciton insulator [352, 353]; in [16], the narrow-gap semiconducting state of Ta2NiSe5 was revealed to be a Z4 = 3 3D TI (see Secs. III and VII). (b) The closely-related quasi-1D transition-metal chalcogenide Ta2NiSe7 [ICSD 61352, SG 12 (C2/m)], which conversely exhibits a charge-density-wave instability [354], was found in [16] to also be a Z4 = 3 3D TI in its normal state. (c) Bi [ICSD 64703, SG 166 (R¯3m)] was previously recognized in [138] to be a Z4 = 2 helical HOTI (Sec. VII); in [16], it was discovered that the bands below EF in rhombohedral bismuth also exhibit stable topology (see Sec. II B). (d) MoGe2 [ICSD 76139, SG 139 (I4/mmm)] was identified in [16] to be a Dirac HOTSM in which the two conduction and four valence bands closest to EF [doubly-degenerate light pink and light blue bands in (d)] are as a set fragile topological (see Secs. II B and VI).

that were stable TIs, TCIs, and TSMs at EF (i.e. at intrinsic electronic filling). Most recently, the authors of [16] performed the first complete high-throughput topological analysis of all of the stoichiometric materials in the ICSD. In this section, we will review the methodology and results of [16], which are freely accessible on the Topological Materials Database (https: //www.topologicalquantumchemistry.com/) implemented for [15, 16].
When the analysis in [16] was performed, the ICSD contained 193,426 entries, including multiple entries for the same material with varying structural parameters obtained in different experimental works. First, the authors of [16] excluded materials that were not close to the stoichiometric limit and entries with incorrect structure files (e.g. files missing atoms present in the chemical formula), and rounded nearly-stoichiometric mate-

rials to have integer-valued atomic occupancies ­ this process reduced the initial 193,426 ICSD entries down to 96,196 stoichiometric entries with processable structure files. The authors then performed high-throughput density functional theory using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [358, 359] on the remaining 96,196 ICSD entries. The high-throughput calculations in [16] resulted in convergent electronic structures for 73,234 ICSD entries in the presence of SOC. To analyze the resulting electronic structures with TQC (see Sec. VI), the authors of [16] wrote a new implementation of the Check Topological Mat tool on the BCS, and then applied the VASP2Trace tool [360] previously implemented for [15] to the electronic structure of each ICSD entry with and without SOC. The VASP2Trace program [360] specifically outputs the small coreps that correspond to the Bloch states in each band at each k point

16

(see Sec. II A), and Check Topological Mat determines whether an energy gap is permitted at a given electronic filling, and determines the stable and fragile SIs of all energetically isolated groups of bands (see Sec. VI). After using VASP2Trace [360] and Check Topological Mat to analyze the 73,234 ICSD entries with convergent bandstructure calculations, it was determined that the data contained 38,298 unique materials ­ defined as ICSD entries with the same chemical formulas, bulk topology at EF , and crystal structures. The computational calculations performed in [16] to generate the Topological Materials Database required 22.60 million CPU hours.
For each ICSD entry in the Topological Materials Database, the topology is characterized using TQC from two perspectives. First, given the number of electrons in each unit cell, the topology at EF is calculated using TQC and SIs (see Sec VI), and is then sorted into one of the five broad categories previously defined in [15]. First, if the occupied bands of the material may be expressed as a linear combination of EBRs, then the material is classified as LCEBR. LCEBR materials, in general, are either trivial or fragile topological, or host non-symmetryindicated stable topology (see Sec. II B); in [16], the authors did not observe any materials for which the entire valence manifold was fragile topological. Next, if the symmetry eigenvalues of the occupied bands imply the existence of a TSM phase, then the material is labeled as an enforced-semimetal with Fermi degeneracy if the bulk is a high-symmetry-point TSM (denoted as ESFD on the Topological Materials Database), and is labeled as an enforced-semimetal if the bulk is a high-symmetryline or plane TSM (denoted as ES on the Topological Materials Database and in Fig. 8, see Sec. V for further TSM classification details). Lastly if a gap is permitted at EF and the bulk exhibits nontrivial stable SIs, then the occupied bands are either classified as a split EBR (denoted as SEBR on the Topological Materials Database and in Fig. 8), or as unequal to a linear combination of EBR pieces (denoted as NLC on the Topological Materials Database and in Fig. 8), respectively depending on whether the occupied bands can or cannot be expressed as linear combinations of pieces (disconnected branches) of EBRs (see [108, 109]). Of the 38,298 unique materials analyzed in [16], 18,133 (47.35%) were LCEBR, 14,037 (36.65%) were enforced TSMs at EF , and 6,128 (16.00%) were TIs and TCIs with nontrivial stable SIs. This surprisingly implied that 52.65% of the known stoichiometric materials are symmetry-indicated TIs, TCIs, or TSMs at intrinsic filling (EF ).
Unlike in previous high-throughput topological analyses [15, 144­146], the version of Check Topological Mat implemented for [16] uniquely allows researchers to analyze the symmetry-indicated stable and fragile topology of energetically isolated bands away from EF . For each ICSD entry in the Topological Materials Database, the authors of [16] calculated the stable and fragile topology of each set of isolated bands in the energy spectrum as defined by band connectivity through TQC

(see [39, 40, 106, 108, 109]). Discarding bands from coreshell atomic orbitals, it was discovered in that among all of the isolated bands in all of the 38,298 unique materials analyzed in [16], 0.37% of bands are fragile topological, 62.05% of bands ­ nearly 2/3 ­ are stable topological, and an overwhelming 87.99% of the stoichiometric materials in the ICSD contain at least one stable or fragile topological band. These numbers are all the more shocking when one considers that many of the unique materials in the Topological Materials Database respect the symmetries of one of the 117 noncentrosymmetric, nonmagnetic SGs in which stable topology cannot be determined by SIs [141, 142]. Indeed, [16] has revealed that band topology is one of the most fundamental and generic properties in solid-state materials classification.
The three research groups that performed the highthroughput analyses in [15, 16, 144­146] each implemented websites for users to access the resulting data. In addition to the aforementioned Topological Materials Database implemented for [15, 16], high-throughput first-principles topological material calculations can be accessed on the Catalogue of Topological Materials (http://materiae.iphy.ac.cn/) created for [144] and the Topological Materials Arsenal (https://ccmp.nju. edu.cn/) created for [145, 146]. All three websites allow users to search for materials by SG and chemical formula, with further functionality and more complete topological characterizations being dependent on the particular website. The Topological Materials Database and the Catalogue of Topological Materials in particular allow users to perform more advanced queries, including searches restricted to materials with specific gap sizes and stable SIs (see Sec. VI). The Topological Materials Database additionally provides users with the stable and fragile topological classification of energetically isolated bands away from EF . In Fig. 8, we show examples of materials on the Topological Materials Database identified in [16] as hosting novel topological properties.
IX. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
In this review, we have followed the discovery of solidstate topological materials from the first theoretical proposals of T -symmetric TIs (see Sec. III) through the recent identification of tens of thousands of candidate TIs, TCIs, and TSMs through high-throughput searches (see Sec. VIII). Despite the recent completion of nonmagnetic solid-state group theory (see Sec. VI), and the complete analysis of the stoichiometric materials in the ICSD performed in [16] (see Sec. VIII), there remain many large, yet-unexplored directions for topological materials discovery. First, the methods used to identify topological materials in [15, 16, 144­146, 303] can only be applied to materials with nontrivial stable and fragile SIs (see Secs. II B and VIII), which are largely centrosymmetric. However, the ICSD [13, 14] still contains thousands of noncentrosymmetric compounds. Because it was dis-

17

covered in [16] that 87.99% of the stoichiometric materials in the ICSD contain topological bands when only SIs are taken into account, then there likely exist thousands of yet-unidentified noncentrosymmetric TIs, TCIs, and TSMs. Furthermore, while the complete stable SIs of magnetic and nonmagnetic TIs, TCIs, and TSMs have been computed [139, 141­143, 302, 303, 316], the magnetic fragile SIs remain an outstanding problem. One route towards the discovery of topological materials beyond SIs involves developing a high-throughput protocol based on carefully-selected Wilson loop calculations (see Sec. II B); several promising early efforts in this direction have been completed this past year [133, 134]. Additionally, despite recent early efforts [86, 93, 94, 97­99], there remain several 3D TCI phases without SIs that have been identified through layer constructions and surface state calculations [141, 302], but do not yet have accompanying bulk [(nested) Wilson loop] topological invariants.
Next, TQC was extended this past year to crystals with commensurate magnetism to construct the theory of magnetic TQC (MTQC) [302]. The formulation of MTQC required the intermediate computation of the magnetic small coreps and EBRs, completing the century-old problem of enumerating irreducible coreps in solid-state group theory [361­363]. Through MTQC, the authors of [302] additionally determined the complete SI groups and formulas of spinful band topology in all 1,651 magnetic and nonmagnetic SGs, subsuming an earlier calculation of the magnetic SI groups in [316], and discovering several novel variants of magnetic HOTIs. MTQC was most recently employed to perform a high-throughput search for magnetic topological materials [303], resulting in the identification of over 100 magnetic TIs, TCIs, and TSMs among the 500 magnetic materials on the BCS with experimentally measured magnetic SGs [364­367]. Structurally chiral magnetic TSM phases were also recently proposed in chiral crystals with commensurate magnetic ordering, including Mn3IrSi [ICSD 151748, SG 198 (P 213)] [368]. However, despite the results of [302, 303, 316, 368], and the recent experimental identification of novel magnetic TCIs [344­347, 369] and TSMs [74, 370, 371], the number of materials whose commensurate magnetic structures have been measured through neutron diffraction and matched with magnetic SGs remains several orders of magnitude smaller than the analogous number of nonmagnetic materials with measured crystal structures and SGs (see Sec. VIII). It is our hope that the recent success of [74, 302, 303, 316, 344­347, 368­371] will encourage experimentalists and computational material scientists to analyze larger numbers of magnetic structures using the magnetic SG classification of magnetic crystalline solids [27]. This would facilitate future theoretical and experimental investigations into materials with linked magnetic and topological order, both at the meanfield level of MTQC [302], and beyond.
As an additional future direction, many of the compounds in the ICSD feature unreported stuctural phases

or chemical complexities beyond the simple descriptions provided in their structure files. A hybrid methodology combining the intuition of trained chemists with the reported topological electronic structures in [15, 16, 144­ 146] could facilitate the development of advanced alloyed or heterostructure topological materials. The engineering of topological heterostructure and few-layer devices has in particular emerged as a promising direction for future studies. For example, researchers have experimentally demonstrated an electronically switchable photocurrent response in the 2D TI WTe2 [66] and cuprate-like superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene [372­374]. Most intriguingly, recent theoretical [86, 115, 118­120, 375­ 378] and experimental [379­386] studies have revealed a relationship between the superconductivity and other interacting phases in twisted bilayer graphene and both fragile and higher-order topology. Further investigations into few-layer topological device engineering may therefore provide insight towards some of the largest outstanding problems in solid-state physics, such as the mechanism of superconductivity in the high-TC cuprate superconductors [387].
Lastly, while this review has largely focused on noninteracting topological phases with crystal symmetry, an emerging future direction in topological materials involves the experimental manipulation of charge-densitywave (CDW) and spin-density-wave phases in solidstate materials. For example, recent theoretical and experimental investigations have provided evidence that structurally chiral, quasi-1D (TaSe4)2I crystals [ICSD 35190, SG 97 (I422)] are Weyl semimetals that become gapped by an incommensurate CDW [388]. In earlier works, Weyl-CDW insulators were proposed to be correlated AXIs [389­391], though recent investigations have revealed that the axionic response of WeylCDWs is captured by mean-field theory [392­394]. The prediction of a Weyl-CDW phase in (TaSe4)2I in [388] was recently confirmed through ARPES measurements of high-temperature Weyl points [395] and transport experiments demonstrating axonic response effects in the low-temperature CDW phase [396]. As discussed in Sec. VII, AXIs have recently been recognized to be HOTIs; additionally, recent theoretical investigations [397] of the CDW phase in 1T-TaS2 [ICSD 52115, SG 164 (P ¯3m1)] [398] have demonstrated the presence of higherorder-topological corner states. T -symmetric TSMCDWs are therefore likely to provide a promising venue for elucidating and exploring novel response effects in helical TCIs and HOTIs ­ phases of matter that owe their existence to the interplay of symmetry and topology in solid-state materials.
