The baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) have proven to be an invaluable tool in constraining the expansion history of the Universe at late times and are characterized by the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch rs(zd). The latter quantity can be calculated either numerically using recombination codes or via fitting functions, such as the one by Eisenstein and Hu (EH), made via grids of parameters of the recombination history. Here we quantify the accuracy of these expressions and show that they can strongly bias the derived constraints on the cosmological parameters using BAO data. Then, using a machine learning approach, called the genetic algorithms, we proceed to derive new analytic expressions for rs(zd) which are accurate at the  0.003% level in a range of 10 around the Planck 2018 best-fit or  0.018% in a much broader range, compared to  2 - 4% for the EH expression, thus obtaining an improvement of two to three orders of magnitude. Moreover, we also provide fits that include the effects of massive neutrinos and an extension to the concordance cosmological model assuming variations of the fine structure constant. Finally, we note that our expressions can be used to ease the computational cost required to compute rs(zd) with a Boltzmann code when deriving cosmological constraints from current and upcoming surveys.

I. INTRODUCTION
Some of the strongest constraints on the expansion of the Universe at late times come from baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data. The BAO were formed in the early Universe, while it was very homogeneous (as probed today by the CMB) except for tiny fluctuations, and the photons and baryons were tightly coupled [1]. As the Universe expanded, it became cooler and less dense, while the fluctuations grew due to gravity. Acoustic waves were generated as the photon-baryon fluid was attracted and fell onto the overdensities producing compressions and rarefactions due to the gravitational collapse and radiation pressure.
These acoustic waves propagated until the Universe became cool enough for the electrons and protons to recombine and then the baryons and photons decoupled. The time when the baryons were "released" from the drag of the photons is known as the drag epoch, zd [2]. From then on, photons expanded freely while the acoustic waves "freezed in" the baryons in a scale given by the size of the sound horizon at the drag epoch, dubbed rs(zd). Progressively, baryons fell into dark matter potential wells but also dark matter was attracted to baryon overdensities. Neutrinos did not interact, so they streamed away while dark matter responded to gravity and fell onto the overdensity.
The perturbations were dominated by photons and baryons as they were coupled, resulting in overdensities and overpressure which tried to equalize with the surrounding resulting in an expanding sound wave moving at the speed of sound, approximately  2/3 the speed of light. The perturbation in photons and baryons was

carried outward and the photons and baryons continued to expand whereas neutrinos spread out. Dark matter continued to fall into perturbations, which kept growing.
As the expanding Universe continued to cool down, it reached a point when the electrons and protons began to combine. Since photons did not scatter as efficiently they started to decouple. The sound speed dropped and the pressure wave slowed down. The process continued until the photons where completely decoupled and then the perturbations smoothed out1. In fact, the sound speed of the baryon perturbation dropped so much that the pressure wave stalled. Thus, the original dark matter perturbation was left surrounded by a baryon perturbation in a shell. The two components attracted each other and the perturbations started to mix2.
The BAO provides a characteristic scale that is "frozen" in the galaxy distribution providing a standard ruler that can be measured as a function of redshift in either the galaxy correlation function or the galaxy power spectrum. The BAO determination of the geometry of the Universe is quite robust against systematics and has been measured by several surveys, such as the SDSS [3] and 2dFGRS [4]. The BAO signature provides a standard ruler that can be used to measure the geometry of the Universe and it can measure both the angular diameter distance dA(z) and the expansion rate H(z). Measurements of the BAO only provide the combination of H0 and rs(zd), which means the two parameters are fully degenerate. As a result, the constraints obtained from the analysis of the BAO can be influenced significantly on the assumption of rs(zd) [5].
In order to accurately estimate rs(zd), one may use either recombination codes, such as RECFAST [6], CosmoRec [7] or HyRec [8, 9], or analytic approximations

based on fits of grids of parameters of the recombination history. A prominent example of the latter approach is the formula by Eisenstein and Hu [10], hereafter known as EH, which provides a fit of rs(zd) in terms of the matter and baryon density parameters. This formula has been extensively used in the literature in analyses of the BAO data, see for example Refs. [11­15]. However, as already observed in Ref. [10], this expression is only accurate to the  2% level and as a result is not appropriate for deriving cosmological constraints from BAO data in a percent cosmology era with current and upcoming surveys.
Over the years attempts to improve the EH formula have appeared. For example, the dependence of rs(zd) on various parameters, including massive and massless neutrinos, was examined in Ref. [16]. On the other hand, fits of rs(zd) including neutrinos and relativistic species were found in Ref. [17] and in Ref. [18]. Finally, how the fraction of the baryonic mass in Helium YP and the relativistic degrees of freedom Neff affects the sound horizon and how both are degenerate, was studied in Ref. [19].
The main limitation of the aforementioned analyses is that some ad-hoc parametrizations were fitted to grids of parameters and rs(zd), thus being limited from the start on how accurate they can be. Hence, in our work we use machine learning to provide, in a data driven approach, extremely accurate fits to the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch rs(zd). We then compare these expressions against both the original formula of EH and the exact numerical estimation of the sound horizon, in order to quantify the amount of bias this expression introduces in the constraints.
In our analysis we also consider separately the effect of massive neutrinos and a varying fine structure constant and we find that our fits provide an improvement of a factor of three compared to other simple parametrizations and can be used in current and upcoming surveys to derive cosmological constraints so as to ease the computational cost that would be required when computing rs(zd) via a Boltzmann code.
The structure of our paper is as follows: in Sec. II we present the theoretical background and main assumptions in our work, while in Sec. III we present some details on our machine learning approach used to improve the sound horizon fits. In Sec. IV we present our main results, while in Sec. V we summarize our conclusions. Finally, in Appendix A we present some complementary fits for the redshift at the drag and recombination epochs.

II. THEORY

The comoving sound horizon at the drag epoch is given by

1 rs (zd) = H0

 cs(z) dz, zd H(z)/H0

(1)

where zd is the redshift at the drag epoch, see Eq. (4) of Ref. [10], while cs(z) is the sound speed in the baryon-

photon fluid given by

c

cs =

,

(2)

3(1 + R)

where R =

3b 4

=

a 3b,0
4,0

and

c

is

the

speed

of

light

in

vacuum. By definition, the sound horizon at the baryon

drag epoch is the comoving distance a wave can travel

prior to zd and it depends on the epoch of recombination, the expansion of the Universe and the baryon-to-photon

ratio. The sound horizon is well determined by the Cos-

mic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements of the

acoustic peaks.

Regarding the neutrinos, neutrino flavour oscillation

experiments have shown that they are massive [20], pro-

viding a direct evidence for physics beyond the Standard

Model. Cosmology is a very propitious stage to probe

neutrino properties since they leave an imprint in the

CMB and in the distribution of Large-Scale Structure

(LSS) in the Universe. The energy density of massive

neutrinos,  = m,in,i, corresponds to

 h2 

m,i , 94eV

(3)

where n represents number density of neutrinos.

We also consider variations of fundamental constants,

which are usually assumed to be constant over space-

time. These constants are defined operationally, meaning

that nature by itself does not force it to be constant.

They have to be obtained experimentally since they are

not given by the theory, see for instance Ref. [21] for a

review on the variation of fundamental constants. Here

we will probe the interesting case where the fine structure

constant,

defined

as

0

=

e2 c

,

is

not

constant and

we

will express its relative variation over its standard model

value as /0.

If there are eventually signatures of a variation it would

have imprints in different physical mechanisms such as

the CMB anisotropies [22]. Constraints on this varia-

tion, both temporal and spatial, have been performed

already [23­29], and this variation can be produced for

example through an evolving scalar field which is coupled

to the electromagnetic Lagrangian [24, 30­32]. This will

give rise to variations of the fine structure constant, a vi-

olation of the Weak Equivalence principle and violations

of the standard TCMB(z) law, as the number of photons

is no longer conserved. These kinds of models can in

principle be constrained by future large scale structure

surveys using high-resolution spectroscopic data in com-

bination with local astrophysical data, see Ref. [33] for

updated constraints with current data and Ref. [34] for

recent forecasts with upcoming surveys.

Another class of models where this occurs is

the Bekenstein-Sanvik-Barrow-Magueijo (BSBM) model

[35], where the electric charge is allowed to vary. Al-

though such theories preserve the local gauge and Lorentz

invariance, the fine structure constant will vary during

the matter dominated era.

Once the initial population has been constructed, the fitness of each member is computed by a 2 statistic, using the rs(zd) data points directly as input. Then, through a tournament selection process, see Ref. [36] for more details, the best-fitting functions in each generation are chosen and the two stochastic operations of crossover and mutation are used. The final output of the code is a mathematical function of rs(zd) that describes the sound horizon at the drag epoch in terms of the various cosmological parameters of interest.

Here we will briefly describe the Genetic Algorithms (GA) that will be used in our analysis to improve the sound horizon fits. The GA have been successfully used in cosmology for several reconstructions on a wide range of data, see for example Refs. [36­46]. Other applications of the GA cover other areas such as particle physics [47­49] and astronomy and astrophysics [50­52]. Other symbolic regression methods implemented in physics and cosmology can be found at [53­60].
The GA can be regarded as a machine learning (ML) technique constructed to carry out unsupervised regression of data, i.e. it performs non-parametric reconstructions that finds an analytic function of one or more variables (like in our case here) that describes the data extremely well. It runs by emulating the concept of biological evolution through the principle of natural selection, as brought by the genetic operations of mutation and crossover. In essence, a set of trial functions evolves as time passes by through the effect of the stochastic operators of crossover, i.e. the joining of two or more candidate functions to form another one, and mutation, i.e. a random alteration of a candidate function. This process is then repeated thousands of times with different random seeds to ensure convergence and explore properly the functional space.
Since the GA is constructed as a stochastic approach, the probability that a population of functions will bring about offspring is principally assumed to be proportional to its fitness to the data, where in our analysis is given by a 2 statistic and give the information on how good every individual agrees with the data. For the simulated data in our analysis we are assuming that the likelihoods are sufficiently Gaussian that we use the 2 in our GA approach. Then, the probability to have offspring and the fitness of each individual is proportional to the likelihood causing an "evolutionary" pressure that favors the bestfitting functions in every population, hence directing the fit towards the minimum in a few generations.
In our analysis we reconstruct the rs(zd) function considering that it depends on the following variables: {mh2, bh2}, {mh2, bh2,  h2} and {mh2, bh2, /0} respectively. Our reconstruction procedure is as follows. First, our predefined grammar was constructed on the following functions: exp, log,

IV. RESULTS
In this section we now present our machine learning fits to the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch rs(zd). First, we will only include the dependence on the matter and baryon density parameters {mh2, bh2}, while later we will also consider the effect of massive neutrinos and a varying fine structure constant, i.e. the parameter vectors will be {mh2, bh2,  h2} and {mh2, bh2, /0} respectively.
To calculate the sound horizon we use the code CLASS by Ref. [61] and the HYREC-2 recombination module Hyrec2020 [8, 9]. We then make grids of parameters and rs(zd) and fit the values with both traditional minimization approaches and with the genetic algorithms, as described in Sec. III. To simplify our notation we make the following definitions that will be used throughout the text: b = bh2, m = mh2 and  =  h2. In what follows, we will now describe our approach in more detail and present the results for the various cases.

A. Matter and baryons only

First, we consider the standard case of matter and
baryons, as was also studied in Ref. [10] (hereafter de-
noted as EH). This case was obtained by simulating values for mh2  [0.025, 0.5] and bh2  0.0125 and is given by [10]

rs (zd)

44.5 ln

9.83 m

Mpc,

(4)

1 + 10 b3/4

which is accurate up to  2%. Since now the recombination codes have more improved physics (for example an improved post-Saha expansion at early phases of hydrogen recombination, see Refs. [8, 62] for a discussion), we have considered the same parametrization as in EH but with the coefficients as free parameters. By fitting the parametrization to a grid of values for rs(zd) for the range mh2  [0.13, 0.15] and bh2  [0.0214, 0.0234], which is around 10 from the Planck best-fit, we find the

4

following improved expression

rs (zd) =

45.5337 ln

7.20376 m

Mpc,

1 + 9.98592 b0.801347

(5)

which is accurate up to  0.009%. Using the same grid of values with the GA we find the following fit which is even better

1

rs(zd) = a1ba2 + a3ma4 + a5ba6 ma7 Mpc,

(6)

where

a1 = 0.00785436, a2 = 0.177084, a3 = 0.00912388,
a4 = 0.618711, a5 = 11.9611, a6 = 2.81343,
a7 = 0.784719.
In this case, our GA improved expression given by Eq. (6) is accurate up to  0.003%.
Next, we also consider a broader range of values for the parameter grid in order to allow for the fitting function to be used in BAO analyses without compromising its accuracy. In particular, we consider the range mh2  [0.05, 0.25] and bh2  [0.016, 0.03] and we find with the GA the following fit

rs(zd) =

a1ba2

1 + a3ba4 ma5

+ a6ma7

-

a8 ma9

Mpc,

(7)

where

a1 = 0.00257366, a2 = 0.05032, a3 = 0.013,
a4 = 0.7720642, a5 = 0.24346362, a6 = 0.00641072,
a7 = 0.5350899, a8 = 32.7525, a9 = 0.315473.
which is accurate up to  0.018%, i.e. a two orders of magnitude improvement from the EH expression of Eq. (4).
Now, in order to quantify the bias introduced in deriving constraints on the cosmological parameters by using the less accurate expression of Eq. (4), we will now present the confidence contours and parameter constraints using the currently available BAO data, using the current BAO data as described in Ref. [42], and the aforementioned rs(zd) expressions. As mentioned earlier, rs(zd) and h  H0/100 are degenerate, we in what follows we will consider the combination rs,dh = rs(zd)h.
In particular, in Fig. 1 we show a comparison of the confidence contours for the EH expression for the sound horizon given by Eq. (4) (blue contour) against the machine learning improved expression (GA) given by Eq. (7) (red contours) and the exact numerical approach (Num.) calculated via Hyrec2020 (green contour). Furthermore, in Table II we show the best-fit, mean and 95% limits for (m,0, rs,dh). As can be seen, using the older and less accurate expression biases strongly the constraints for both m,0 and rs(zd)h by almost half a  and shifts the best-fit m,0 by  9.3% from its true value, which is obtained using the full numerical approach.

B. Matter, baryons and massive neutrinos

Next, we also include massive neutrinos and this time we compare with the expression of Ref. [17], where the following fit was presented

55.154 exp -72.3 ( + 0.0006)2

rs(zd) 

m0.25351b0.12807

Mpc, (8)

which is accurate up to 0.29% within our range of values considered. Notice that this expression is accurate up to 0.021% if we limit to the range within 3 of values derived by Planck and that  = 0.0107 ( m/1.0eV).
In our case we consider the parameters in the range mh2  [0.13, 0.15], bh2  [0.0214, 0.0234], which is

5

around 10 from Planck, and for the massive neutrinos in the range 0 < m < 0.6eV. Then, with the GA we find the improved fit which reads as follows

rs(zd) =

a1 ea2(a3+ )2 a4 ba5 + a6 ma7 + a8 (b m)a9

Mpc,

(9)

where the coefficients take the following values

a1 = 0.0034917, a2 = -19.972694, a3 = 0.000336186, a4 = 0.0000305, a5 = 0.22752, a6 = 0.00003142567, a7 = 0.5453798, a8 = 374.14994, a9 = 4.022356899,

which is accurate up to 0.0076%, i.e. roughly a factor of three improvement over Eq. (8).

C. Matter, baryons and the fine structure constant

Finally, we also consider the effects of a varying fine
structure constant on the sound horizon at the drag red-
shift. The fine structure constant is only included in the
the recombination code Hyrec2020 [8, 9], thus the only
modification in the code in this case that was needed,
was passing an extra parameter to CLASS.
Then, we simulate values of the rs(zd) for the range mh2  [0.13, 0.15], bh2  [0.0214, 0.0234] and /0  [0.98, 1.02]. The range for /0 might seem restrictive, but in Ref. [63] it was shown that with current data any variations are constrained to /0  10-3, while with future large scale structure data and local astrophysical
measurements the constraints can be further reduced to /0  10-6. Following the same procedure as before we find the following fitting formula using an EH-like
parametrization

rs (zd) =

a1 ln

a2 m

1 + a3 ba4

/0

a5 Mpc,

(10)

which is accurate up to  0.026% and the parameters are given by

a1 = 45.504, a2 = 7.15391, a3 = 9.98792, a4 = 0.805083, a5 = -1.34678.
On the other hand, with the GA we have found an improved fit which reads as follows

1 rs(zd) = a1ba2 ma3 [(/0)a4 + ba5 ma6 ] + a7ma8 Mpc,
(11)
where the coefficients take the following values

a1 = 0.00759287, a2 = 0.0865956, a3 = 0.104933, a4 = 2.05112, a5 = 0.327626, a6 = 0.045884, a7 = 0.00723555, a8 = 0.933333,
which is accurate up to 0.0062%, which is roughly a factor of four improvement over the EH-like parametrization of Eq. (10).

V. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we have presented extremely accurate machine learning fits to the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch rs(zd) as a function of cosmological parameters and we compared our results with other expressions found in the literature. In particular, we considered the widely used Eisenstein-Hu fitting formula given by Eq. (4), which is accurate to the  2% level, and showed how it may strongly bias any constraints on the matter density parameter obtained by using the current BAO data as described in Ref. [42].
In particular, we found that the confidence contours are biased by roughly half a sigma, while the matter density parameter m,0 is shifted at a  9.3% level from its correct value, which is obtained using the full numerical analysis. On the other hand, our machine learning fits given by Eq. (6) do not suffer from this issue, as they are accurate to within  0.003%. Furthermore, in our analysis we also considered the effect of massive neutrinos, see Eq. (9) and a varying fine structure constant, see Eq. (11), finding that our fits have an improvement of a factor of three to four compared to other simple EH-like parametrizations.
To conclude, we presented machine learning improved expressions for the sound horizon at the drag redshift, which are more accurate in some cases even by two orders of magnitude compared to other similar expressions already found in the literature. The advantage of our approach is that the new expressions do not bias the parameter constraints obtained from BAO data, thus they can be used in BAO analyses coming from current and upcoming surveys to derive cosmological constraints and ease the computational cost that would be required when computing rs(zd) with a full Boltzmann code.

and which is accurate up to  3.7%.
To improve this fit, we simulate values for zd in the range mh2  [0.13, 0.15] and bh2  [0.0214, 0.0234] which is around 10 from Planck. Then, with the GA

and which is accurate up to  0.3%.
To improve this fit, we simulate values for z for the range mh2  [0.13, 0.15] and bh2  [0.0214, 0.0234] which is around 10 from Planck. Then, as before, with
the GA we find
