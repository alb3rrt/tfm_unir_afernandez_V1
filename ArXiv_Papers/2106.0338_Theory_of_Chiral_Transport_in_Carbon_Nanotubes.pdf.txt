Abstract
Based on the similarity between the chiral nanotube and the classical solenoid, we study chiral transport along the circumferential direction in a carbon nanotube. We calculate the chiral conductivity, representing a circumferential current induced by an electric field along the nanotube axis for various chiralities of carbon nanotubes. We find that the chiral conductivity in a chiral nanotube is in general non zero, and oscillates as a function of the Fermi energy. This oscillating behavior is attributed to the subband structure of the nanotubes and the warping of the Fermi surfaces.

Introduction
Carbon nanotubes1,2 have been attracting much interest for their unique properties and for their possibilities of applications for electronic devices, such as a field-emission display3 and nanocomposite materials,4 nanosensors.5 Its novel transport properties has been revealed experimentally. For example, quantized conductance is measured,6 and the ballistic conduction for both single7 and multi-wall8 carbon nanotubes are reported. Theoretically, a

carbon nanotube can be either a metal or a semiconductor, depending on its chirality. This property is understood from the band structure of a graphene and periodic boundary conditions along the circumference direction. Because of the singular band structure and unique structure of a carbon nanotube, its transport properties are expected to be intriguing.9­12
In a chiral carbon nanotube, lower crystallographic symmetry allows chiral transport, i.e. a current in the circumferential direction induced by an electric field along the tube. Namely, when carriers are doped, an electric current along the tube axis induces a current around the tube. In a previous study, the chiral transport along the circumferential direction has been suggested in a BC2N nanotube theoretically,9 although the BC2N nanotube has not been fabricated yet.13 In Ref.,9 both first-principles and tight-binding calculations are performed for the BC2N nanotube, and they predicted that an electric field in BC2N nanotube induces chiral transport, analogous to a solenoid. In Ref.,14 the chiral conductivity is calculated for a BC2N nanotube and a carbon nanotube and is shown to be non-zero. Here dependence on the chirality and on the doping are not explicitly shown. For the BN nanotube, the dynamical current directing the chiral shift has been calculated. However, the dependence on the chiral angle and the electronic concentration has not been studied.15 Furthermore, chiral current is investigated for metallic carbon nanotubes16 and stretched carbon nanotubes.17 Experimental detection of the chiral current is also proposed.18 The oscillation of the chiral currents

in a carbon nanotube as a function of the Fermi energy is reported, in which the giant magnetization is expected.19 Moreover, chiral transport in three-dimensional chiral crystals has been also proposed recently,20,21 as well as in threedimensional topological insulators22 and in twodimensional surface and interfaces without inversion symmetry.23
In the present paper, we study dependence of the chiral current on the chirality of the carbon nanotubes. We calculate the chiral conductivity in carbon nanotubes, which is given by the ratio between the applied electric field along the nanotube axis and the induced current around the tube. As a function of the Fermi energy, the chiral conductivity is shown to oscillate with kinks. ThMoreover, its sign depends on m - n modulo 3, where (m, n) is the chirality of the nanotube. This singular behavior is interpreted in terms of the subband structure of the nanotube, and warping of the Fermi surfaces is crucial here. Thus, it shows that the carbon nanotube is a unique stage for chiral transport, where chiral nature can be controlled in a unique way out of the same structure.
We first consider symmetry requirements to have chiral transport. When a current J flows along the tube axis, a chiral current is induced and a magnetization M along the tube will be induced. Thus the chiral response within the linear response is described as M = CJ with constant C, and J being the current along the tube axis. This response is called kinetic magnetoelectric effect and orbital Edelstein effect,20,21,24­32 and has been studied in the threedimensional bulk metals20,21and in topological insulators.22 This effect is an orbital analog of the spin Edelstein effect.33­35 We will see in the following that the carbon nanotubes are special in that it contains various structures with various chiralities, based on the same twodimensional graphene sheet. Then we can see that the system should simultaneously break three types of symmetries: (i) inversion symmetry, (ii) mirror symmetry with respect to the plane perpendicular to the tube axis, and (iii) mirror symmetry with respect to the plane including the tube axis, in order to realize chiral transport induced by a current along the tube.

The response coefficient C vanishes when the system is invariant under either of these operations. In the three types of carbon nanotubes, i.e. armchair, zigzag and chiral ones, the symmetries are different as summarized in Table 1. We see that only chiral nanotubes break all the three types of symmetries. in the same way as in classical solenoids. Thus, chiral carbon nanotubes are candidates for a chiral transport, similar to a classical solenoid. We note that in some three-dimensional chiral materials, similar response has been discussed. In carbon nanotubes, we will see that based on a same bulk band structure of graphene, one can have varieties of chiral structures, and we can systematically study various chiral effects.

We here explain the chirality of the the car-

bon nanotube. Figures 1(a)(b) show the chi-

ral vector Ch and the translational vector T for the chirality (4, 2). The chiral vector Ch

is a translation vector in graphene, which con-

stitutes the chiral vector

a = 0.246[nm].36­38 Chirality of the carbon nan-

otube is then labeled by index (n, m). The vec-

common multiple of 2m + n and 2n + m. The

number of hexagon N, contained in unit cell de-

scribed by the rectangle spanned by Ch and T in Fig. 1(a) is given by N = 2(n2+m2+nm)/dR.

The chiral angle c, which is an angle between

(b) The vectors Ch and T in the nanotube. (c) First Brillouin-zone for the (4,2) carbon nanotube is represented in blue. The gray hexagon represents the first Brillouin zone in graphene. The wavevector along the K2 is quantized, which is shown as a set of short segments shown in red. For convenience, we reexpress the allowed wavevectors in (d) as a set of parallel segments inside the Brillouin zone of the graphene.

In the carbon nanotube, the wave number

k along the circumferential direction is quantized.36­38 Namely, the wave vector in the car-

bon nanotube is expaned in terms of K1 and

K2 as

with k1 quantized as

k1 = 0, 1, 2, · · · , N - 1, -/|T|  k2 < /|T|. (2)
K1 and K2 are the reciprocal vectors of the car-

bon nanotube corresponding to T and Ch, respectively, satisfying

Ch·K1 = 2, Ch·K2 = 0, T·K1 = 0, T·K2 = 2. (3)
Namely, K1 and K2 are given by K1 = (-t2b1+ t1b2)/N and K2 = (mb1 - nb2)/N , with b1 = 2(1, 1// 3) and b2 = (0, 4/ 3). As an example, the first Brillouin zone of the carbon nanotube for the chirality (4, 2) is shown in blue in Fig. 1(c).
The energy dispersion in the carbon nanotube can be described from that in graphene. Namely, the energy band in the carbon naotube is given by that in graphene with the wave vector quantized along the K1 direction. In this paper, we use the tight-binding model with a nearest-neighbor hopping,9,39­41

Here, we note that the energy dispersion is ex-

actly the same as that in graphene, except the

fact that the wave number is discretized in the

carbon nanotube. The Fermi energy is set at

EF = 0. It is known that the carbon nanotube is metallic when the wave vector crosses the

Dirac points at K and K points in graphene

which corresponds to (n - m)  0 (mod 3),

and semiconducting for the other chiralities.11

We can calculate the chiral conductivity 12 from xx, xy and yy in eq. (7), by rotating the coordinate axes from x, y to 1, 2 bythe angle c. As a result, the chiral conductivity 12 is obtained as

where 1 and 2 represent the circumferential direction and the direction along the tube, respectively. We calculate the chiral conductivity 12 by varying two parameters, the chirality (n, m) and the electronic concentration ni. Because the band dispersion depends on chirality, the Fermi level is numerically determined for an electronic concentration ni for each carbon nanotube.
Figures 2 (a) and (b) shows the chiral conductivity 12 as a function of the chiral angle for the electronic concentration ni = 0.001, measured from the undoped value. We set the chirality as (8, m) in (a) and (15, m) in (b), where integer m is changed from 0 to 8. Generally, the sign of the chiral conductivity 12 depends on m through the value (n - m)  0, 1, 2 (mod 3). Namely, for (n - m)  1 (2) (mod 3), the sign of 12 is positive (negative). For (n - m) 

0 (mod 3) when the carbon nanotube becomes metallic, 12 is almost zero. We note that 12 becomes zero for m = 0 because the carbon nanotube is of the armchair type and chiral transport is prohibited by symmetry. Furthermore, |12| tends to become larger as the chiral angle increases, with an exception of m = 5, 10 for n = 15.
We found that 12 tend to become larger as the integers m and n in the chirality (m, n) become larger in general, by calculating also for the chiralities (4, m), (12, m), (20, m) and (30, m), although not shown here. This is because the contribution from the Fermi surfaces to 12 becomes larger for large chirality. The density of states on the Fermi level increases as chirality increases, with some exceptions with accidental local minima of 12 such as those for m = 5, 10 in Fig. 2(b). We interpret these remarkable dependences of 12 on chirality in terms of the warping of the Fermi surfaces. For large doping, the warping effect is prominent and the contributions to 12 do not perfectly cancel each other in metallic carbon nanotube, as we discuss later.
Figures 2(c) and (d) shows 12 as a function of electronic concentration ni for 0  ni  0.2 for the chiralities (a) (8, 6) and (b) (20, 16). Generally, 12 oscillates as a function of ni, with sharp kinks where 12 changes between an increasing and a decreasing function of ni. As ni becomes even larger and approaches 1, which is not realistic but is studied only for a theoretical interest, the chiral conductivity converges to zero, because electrons occupy all the bands in the model, giving no carriers in the hole picture.
To explain the oscillation of 12, we analyze the dependence of 12 on ni in the (8, 6) carbon nanotube for 0  ni  0.2 in Fig. 2 (c). As an example, in Fig. 3(a) we show the Fermi surface at ni = 0.03, where 12 monotonically increases. The rhombus in the figure is the unit cell for the reciprocal space of graphene, which is equivalent to the first Brillouin zone. The wavevector k is discretized along the K1 direction (see eq. (1)), shown as the parallel lines, giving rise to subband structures. We label each subband by the value of the integer k1, and they

a function of ni. We can see the negative contribution from the 6th band in Fig. 3 (c) appears for ni > 0.055. Therefore, the sharp kink of 12 at ni = 0.055 is attributed to the negative contribution of the 6th band to 12 for ni > 0.055. As the electron concentration increases, the Fermi surface crosses the 7th, 8th, 6th, 9th and 5th bands consecutively, and they contribute to the chiral conductivity with various signs. This corresponds to the points of the sharp kinks in Fig. 2 (c). Besides, the signs of the contributions changes alternately in the order, 7th, 8th, 6th, 9th and 5th, which explains the oscillation of 12 as a function of ni.

are shown as the indices from 5 to 9 for the subbands near the Fermi level. There are two Fermi surfaces, near the K and the K' points for the graphene. At ni = 0.03, the Fermi level crosses only the 7th and 8th lines. The chiral conductivity 12 in eq. (6) is attributed to the states at the Fermi energy. Here we focus on the Fermi surface near the K point, because the contribution from the states near the K point and that near the K' point are the same by the time-reversal symmetry. The states on the Fermi level near the K point are represented by four intersection points between the Fermi surface and the allowed wavevectors specified by the parallel lines. On the other hand, for ni = 0.055, where the chiral conductivity 12 shows a peak in Fig. 2 (c), the Fermi surface is illustrated in Fig. 3 (a). In addition to the four intersection points on the 7th and the 8th lines in Fig. 3 (a), the Fermi surface and the 6th line come in contact with each other in this case. To see how each band contributes to the chiral conductivity 12, we show in Fig. 3 (c) the contributions to 12 from each subband as

The lines describe the subbands of the carbon nanotube. The arrows normal to the Fermi surface denote the Fermi velocity, which can be decomposed into the circumferential velocity v1 and the velocity along the tube v2.
To understand the reason for the singular behavior of 12, we first assume the band structure around the K point to be a perfect Dirac cone with perfect linear dispersion Ek = |k - k0| where  is a constant, and k0 is either the K or K' point. Then 12 is completely zero for any chiralities and the electronic concentrations. Since the linear dispersion Ek = |k-k0| makes the Fermi surface to be a circle without warping, there are always a pair of Fermi points in the same subband, where the values of v1 are the same while the signs of v2 are opposite (the points P and Q in Fig. 4 (a)). Their contributions to 12 in eq. (6) completely cancels each other because of symmetry. In reality, the Fermi surfaces in carbon nanotubes are distorted from a circle and have a warping (Fig. 4 (b)). For the Fermi surface with the warping, the chiral conductivity has a nonzero value in general, because the contributions from the Fermi points do not necessarily cancel each other.
For n - m  0 (mod 3), one of the subbands crosses the Dirac point in graphene. In this case, the contributions cancel each other almost completely for the low electronic concentration such as ni = 0.001, because the Fermi surface is almost symmetric with respect to the subband

line going across the Dirac point. However, the contribution does not vanish completely each other for a higher electronic concentration, because of the large warping of the Fermi surface.
We now estimate the value of the current flowing along the circumferential direction. When the electric field is applied along the axis, the current per unit length along the circumferential direction j1 is given by

(9)

where I2 is the current along the nanotube, and R is the radius of the carbon nanotube. We note that 22 is the longitudinal conductivity along the tube axis, calculated from eq. (8). In Fig. 5(a), we show the comparison of 22 and 12 in the (8, 6) carbon nanotube, where the diameter is R = 0.47nm. 22 increases with some oscillations as ni increases. 22 shows a moderate kink at the electronic concentrations where 12 shows sharp peaks and dips. This is becasue new subbands begin to contribute to 12 and22, as we increase the concentration, as we have seen in this paper. In Fig. 5(b), we show the ratio between 22 and 12, which represents a dimensionless figure of merit for the chiral transport. We note that the ratio becomes largest at a very low concentration, and that it oscillates, converging to zero for larger ni because 22 increases rapidly as the Fermi level increases. The positions of the peaks of the oscillation correspond to that of 12 and 22. For a very low concentration region, the ratio takes a value  -0.15 in this case, and becomes zero at ni = 0. For the (8, 6) nanotube, the maximum current which can be applied to the carbon nanotube is I1max × S = 6.6 × 10-8A,42 with the cross section of the (8, 6) nanotube S = 6.6 × 10-17cm2. For 12/22  -1.5, j1 is j1 = -3.5A/cm from eq. (9), corresponding to 4.4 gauss. The (orbital) magnetization per unit length of the nanotube is estimated as M = j2S = -0.23 × 10-15A · cm.

Concluding remarks
In conclusion, we studied chiral transport in carbon nanotubes. We calculated the chiral conductivity by using the tight-binding model and the Boltzmann transport equation for the electric field applied along the axis of the carbon nanotube. We found that the chiral conductivity 12 is nonzero for semiconducting chiral carbon nanotubes with doping. For a constant electronic concentration, its sign alternately changes as the chiral angle increases, and it becomes positive, negative and zero when for the cases with n - m  1, 2, 0(mod3), respectively. As a function of the electron concentration, 12 oscillates. This is attributed to the different signs of the contributions from the individual subbands to 12. As the electronic concentration increases, the Fermi surface crosses the subbands with positive and negative contributions to 12, giving rise to a peculiar oscillatory dependence on the concentration. Finally, we have estimated the value of chiral current and magnetization induced by the chiral current.
This kind of chiral transport has been also studied in bulk metals and topological insulators in three dimensions. For example, in tellurium, this chiral transport has been evaluated by ab initio calculation28 and a related experiment on current-induced magnetization has been performed.26 Tellurium hss left-handed and right-handed crystals, which consist of onedimensional chains in shapes of helices, and one

can see its analogy with a classical solenoid easily. On the other hand, in chiral nanotubes, its chirality is not fixed but can switch between both directions by changing an electron concentration.
This effect induces an orbital magnetization in carbon nanotubes, and through the spinorbit coupling it might also lead to spin magnetization, which might be one route to induce the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. 43­47
