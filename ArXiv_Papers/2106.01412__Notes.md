## Abstract

We derive the equations for the odd and even parity perturbations of coupled electromagnetic and gravitational fields of a black hole with an electric charge within the context of general nonlinear electrodynamics. The Lagrangian density is a generic function of the Lorentz invariant scalar quantities of the electromagnetic fields. We also include the Hodge dual of the electromagnetic field tensor and the cosmological constant in our calculations. For each type of parity, we reduce the system of Einstein field equations coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics to two Schr√∂dinger-type wave equations, one for the gravitational field and one for the electromagnetic field.
