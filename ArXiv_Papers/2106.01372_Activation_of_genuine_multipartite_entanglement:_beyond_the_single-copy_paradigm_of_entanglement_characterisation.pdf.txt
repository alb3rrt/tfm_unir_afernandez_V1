Entanglement shared among multiple parties presents complex challenges for the characterisation of different types of entanglement. One of the most basic insights is the fact that some mixed states can feature entanglement across every possible cut of a multipartite system, yet can be produced via a mixture of partially separable states. To distinguish states that genuinely cannot be produced from mixing partially separable states, the term genuine multipartite entanglement was coined. All these considerations originate in a paradigm where only a single copy of the state is distributed and locally acted upon. In contrast, advances in quantum technologies prompt the question of how this picture changes when multiple copies of the same state become locally accessible. Here we show that multiple copies unlock genuine multipartite entanglement from partially separable states, even from undistillable ensembles, and even more than two copies can be required to observe this effect. With these findings, we characterise the notion of partial separability in the paradigm of multiple copies and conjecture a strict hierarchy of activatable states and an asymptotic collapse of hierarchy.

Entanglement shared among multiple parties is acknowledged as one of the fundamental resources driving the second quantum revolution [1], for instance, as a basis of quantum network proposals [2­5], as a key resource for improved quantum sensing [6] and quantum error correction [7] or as generic ingredient in quantum algorithms [8] and measurement-based quantum computation [9, 10]. Yet, its detection and characterisation is complicated by several factors: among them, the computational hardness of deciding whether any given system even exhibits any entanglement at all [11] as well as the fact that the usual paradigm of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) lead to infinitely many types of entanglement [12­16] already for single copies of multipartite states. Significant effort has thus been devoted to devising practical means of entanglement certification from limited experimental data [17, 18].
One of the principal challenges for the characterisation of multipartite entanglement lies in distinguishing between biseparability and its counterpart, genuine multipartite entanglement (GME). Here, a multipartite state is called partially separable if it is separable with respect to some partition of the parties into two or more groups, and any mixture of partially separable states is called biseparable, whereas any state that cannot be decomposed in this way has GME (see Fig. 1). This distinction arises naturally when considering the resources required to create a specific state: any biseparable state can be produced via LOCC in setups where all parties share classical randomness and subsets of parties share en-

qubits. All three-qubit states separable w.r.t. to one of

the three bipartitions, A1 A2A3 (yellow), A2 A1A3 (darker

green), and A3 A1A2 (background), form convex sets, whose

intersection contains all fully separable states A1 A2 A3

(blue). The convex hull of these partially separable states

contains all biseparable states. All states that are not bisep-

arable are GME. States with k-copy activatable GME are

contained in the set of biseparable but not partially separable

states (lighter green areas). The horizontal line represents the

family of isotropic GHZ states (p), containing the maximally

tangled states (which are thus partially separable states w.r.t. all parties). One of the counter-intuitive features of biseparable states is the possibility for bipartite entanglement across every possible cut (cf. [19, footnote on p. 4]). Consequently, the notion of bipartite entan-

FIG. 2. Activation of GME from biseparable states.
(a) Separable bipartite states remain separable, no mat-
ter how many copies are shared, e.g., if A1A2 and B1B2 are separable w.r.t. the bipartitions A1 A2 and B1 B2, then
so is A1A2  B1B2 . (b) In contrast, the joint state of multiple copies of biseparable states, e.g.,  , A1, A2, . . . , AN  , B1, B2, . . . , BN and  , C1, C2, . . . , CN can be GME w.r.t. the partition A1B1C1 A2B2C2 . . . AN BN CN .

glement is insufficient to capture the complexity of the

state space, and conventional methods, such as positive

maps [20, 21], cannot be straightforwardly applied to re-

veal GME [22, 23], which results in additional challenges

compared to the --relatively --simpler scenario of detect-

ing bipartite or partial entanglement (e.g., as in [24]).

An assumption inherent in the above is that all parties

locally act only on a single copy of the distributed state.

However, in many experiments where quantum states are

distributed among (potentially distant) parties, multiple

independent but identically prepared copies of states are

(or at least, can be) shared. A prominent example of

such a situation is found in photonic experiments based

on down-conversion sources, see, e.g., [25]. Even limited

access to quantum memories or signal delays then allows

one to act on multiple copies of the distributed states,

which is a recurring theme also in research on quantum

networks [26, 27]. Characterising properties of GME

in multi-copy scenarios is thus not only of fundamental

theoretical importance but also a crucial problem for

practical applications.

However, we demonstrate here that, unlike the dis-

tinction between separable and entangled states, the dis-

tinction between biseparability and GME is not main-

tained in the transition from one to many copies. As

we show, for N parties 1, . . . , N , there exist multipar-

tite quantum states A1, A2, . . . , AN that are biseparable, but which can be activated in the sense that shar-

ing two copies results in a GME state, i.e., such that

   A1, A2, . . . , AN

B1, B2, . . . , BN

is not

biseparable

with

re-

spect to the partition A1B1 A2B2 . . . AN BN , see Fig. 2.

That such an activation of GME is in principle possi-

ble had previously only been noted in [28], where it was

observed that two copies of a particular four-qubit state

that is itself almost fully separable can become GME.

Here, we systematically investigate this phenomenon of

multi-copy GME activation. As the first main result,

we show that the property of biseparability is not ten-

sor stable in general by identifying a family of N -qubit

isotropic Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states with

two-copy activatable GME for all N . We further demon-

strate the existence of biseparable states within this fam-

ily for which two copies are not enough to activate GME,

but three copies are. Moreover, we show that the bound

for partial separability coincides with the asymptotic (in

terms of the number of copies) GME-activation bound

for isotropic GHZ states.

Multi-copy GME activation is particularly remarkable

--and may appear surprising at first --because it is in

stark contrast to bipartite entanglement: sharing two

copies of any bipartite separable state always results

in a bipartite separable state. In other words, if 

A1 A2

and  are separable with respect to the bipartitions

B1 B2

A1 A2

and

B1 B2,

respectively,

then

   A1A2

B1 B2

is always separable with respect to the bipartition

A1B1 A2B2. However, from the perspective of entangle-

ment distillation --the concentration of entanglement

from many weakly entangled (copies of) states to few

strongly entangled ones --such an activation seems

more natural. After all, if one party shares bipartite

maximally entangled states with each other party, these

could be used to establish any GME state among all

N parties via standard teleportation, thus distributing

GME by sharing only two-party entangled states. Nev-

ertheless, such a procedure would require at least N - 1

copies of these bipartite entangled states (in addition

to a local copy of the GME state to be distributed),

and already the example from [28] suggests that other

mechanisms can be exploited. While we have seen that

the phenomenon of GME activation is more than just

distillation, one may still be tempted to think that

distillable entanglement is required for GME activation.

That is, it is known that there exist bound entangled

states --entangled states that do not admit distillation of

entanglement no matter how many copies are provided.

In particular, all entangled states with positive partial

transpose (PPT) across a given cut are undistillable

since any number of copies is also PPT. One might thus

suspect that GME activation should not be possible for

biseparable states that are PPT across every cut and

hence have no distillable entanglement. As another main

result we show that this is not the case by constructing

a biseparable state that is PPT w.r.t. every cut yet

two copies of the state are indeed GME. Together, our

results thus support the following conjectures:

(i) There exists a hierarchy of states with k-copy
activatable GME, i.e., for all k  2 there exists a biseparable but not partially separable state  such that k-1 is biseparable, but k is GME.

(ii) GME may be activated for any biseparable but not partially separable state (light green areas in Fig. 1) of any number of parties as k  .
In the following, we first provide the formal definitions

3

for biseparability and GME before turning to the family of N -qubit isotropic GHZ states. For all biseparable states in this family we provide upper bounds on the minimal number of copies required to activate GME. We then consider the case of three qubits (N = 3), for which we can show that the bound on three-copy GME activation is tight in the sense that we identify all states in the family for which one requires at least three copies to activate GME, while two copies remain biseparable. Subsequently, we construct an explicit example for two-copy GME activation from biseparable states with no distillable bipartite entanglement. Finally, we analyse the implications of our results and discuss open questions.

When generalising to density matrices, it is common not to specify all possible partitions, but to use the notion of k-separability instead: A density operator is called kseparable if it can be decomposed as a convex sum of pure states that are all separable w.r.t. to some k-partition, i.e., if it is of the form

(k) =

ferent k-partition. Consequently, k-separability does

not imply separability of (k) w.r.t. a specific partition,

except when (k) is a pure state or when k = N . In

the latter case the state is called fully separable. To

make this distinction more explicit, we refer to all (at

least) biseparable states that are actually separable

w.r.t. to some partition as partially separable. At the

other end of this separability spectrum one encounters

biseparable states (k = 2), while all states that are not at least biseparable (formally, k = 1) are called genuinely

N -partite entangled. To simplify the discussion, we

will here use the term GME for the case k = 1. The

operational reason for this definition of GME is easily

explained: any biseparable state of the form of Eq. (2)

can be created by N parties purely by sharing partially

separable states of the form of Eq. (1) and some classical

randomness. In addition, this conveniently results in a

convex notion of biseparability (as illustrated for the

example in Fig. 1) amenable to entanglement witness

techniques, which inherently rely on convexity.

GME of isotropic GHZ states. To overcome the difficulty in analyzing GME, the crucial technique here is to use states in X-form, i.e., those with nonzero entries of density operators only on the main diagonal and main anti-diagonal w.r.t. the computational basis. Let us now

consider a family of mixed N -qubit states, isotropic GHZ states, given by

with real mixing parameter p  [-1 (2N - 1), 1]. Since

states in this family are in X-form w.r.t. the N -qubit

computational basis, we can straightforwardly calcu-

late the genuine multipartite (GM) concurrence [29, 30].

For any N -qubit density operator X in X-form, i.e.,

X =

,

where

a~

diag{a1, . . . , an},

nal, the GM concurrence is given by

n

CGM(X ) = 2 max 0, max{ zi -

and provides a necessary and sufficient condition for

GME (or, more specifically, genuine N -partite entangle-

ment) whenever CGM > 0. In the case of the state (p)

from

Eq.

(3),

we

have

ai

and

zi

such that

CGM (p) = max{0, p - (1 - p)(1 - 21-N )}. (6)

Thus, (p) is GME if and only if

p>

p(1)

(N

)

=

2N-1 - 1 , 2N - 1

(7)

i.e., if and only if p surpasses the single-copy thresh-

old

p(1)

.

Conversely, we can be certain that (p)

is not GME for p  (2N-1 - 1) (2N - 1), and hence

at least biseparable (generally, k-separable for some

k  {2, 3, . . . , N }).

Multi-copy GME criterion. Our first goal is then to
check if two copies of (p) are GME. Although we do not have a necessary and sufficient criterion available to check (p)2 (which is not of X-form even if a single copy is) for GME, we can make use of the fact that stochastic

LOCC (or SLOCC) does not allow one to create GME

from a biseparable state. To construct a sufficient GME criterion, we use a map E such that for any states  and  on H, the state    is mapped to

E[  ] =

 Tr(  )

in H,

(8)

where "" denotes the Hadamard product (or Schur product), i.e., the component-wise multiplication of the
two matrices. The map E can be implemented via

4

SLOCC [31]. What is useful for us here is that the
Hadamard product of two X-matrices results in an X-
matrix. Consequently, we can directly calculate the GM
concurrence for the state resulting from applying the
`Hadamard-product map' E to two copies of an originally biseparable state. If the GM concurrence of E[(p)2] is nonzero, we can conclude that two copies of (p) are GME, even if a single copy is not. To decide whether E[(p)2] is GME or not, i.e., whether the GM concurrence is nonzero or not, we can ignore the normalization and just consider (p)  (p) = (p)2. Moreover, in the maximization over the index i in Eq. (5), the maximum is obtained for i = 1. We can thus conclude that (p)2 is GME if

we find that two copies are still biseparable, and thus

at least three copies are required to activate GME.

The explicit biseparable decomposition of two copies

of the states in this range is presented in Appendix A. Although it does not constitute conclusive proof, this result nevertheless supports Conjecture (i), i.e., that there exists a hierarchy of k-copy activatable states for which k copies are indeed required to obtain GME.
Activatable & non-activatable states. The conjectured existence of a hierarchy of biseparable states with k-copy activatable GME means that states become less and less `valuable' as the number of copies k required to obtain GME increases. At the same time, it is also clear that all partially separable states cannot be used to activate GME because separability w.r.t. any fixed partition is tensor stable. But it is not clear where exactly the boundary between activatable and non-activatable states really lies (see Fig. 1). To shed light on this question, let us again examine the isotropic GHZ states from Eq. (3) with regards to partial separability w.r.t. the bipartition separating the first from the remaining N - 1 qubits. That is, we can write

it hold in general?

GME activation of PPT entangled states. A situation where one might imagine Conjecture (ii) to fail is the situation of biseparable (but not partially separable) states with PPT entanglement across every bipartition. For isotropic GHZ states, the PPT criterion across every cut coincides exactly with the threshold pcrit for partial separability (and GME activation), as one can confirm by calculating the eigenvalues of the partial transpose of (p) (see Appendix B). We thus turn to a different family of states, for which this is not the case. Specifically, as we

Using a GME witnesses

based on the lifted Choi map (cf. [22, 23]), we show that

there exists a parameter range where these PPT-triangle

states are GME.

Conclusion and Outlook. Our results show that a modern theory of entanglement in multipartite systems, which includes the potential to locally process multiple copies of distributed quantum states, exhibits a rich structure that goes beyond the convex structure of single copies. While we conjecture that asymptotically, an even simpler description might be possible, i.e., separability in multipartite systems collapses to a simple bipartite concept of separability, we show that two copies are certainly

not sufficient for reaching this simple limit, thus leaving the practical certification a rich problem to be studied.
Indeed, our results show that GME is a resource with a complex relationship to bipartite entanglement in the context of local operations and shared randomness (cf. [32]). An array of important open questions arises from our results, which can thus be considered to establish an entirely new direction of research: first and foremost, this includes the quest for conclusive evidence for or against our conjectures. Besides determining whether these conjectures are ultimately correct or not, it will be of high interest to determine which properties (of the biseparable decompositions) of given states permit or prevent GME activation with a certain number of copies. Another open question is the minimal local dimension necessary for GME activation from biseparable states with PPT entanglement across every cut. And from a practical point of view it will be desirable to develop a theory of k-copy multipartite entanglement witnesses that are non-linear expressions of density matrices and allow for a more fine-grained characterisation of multipartite entanglement in networks with memory.

Appendix A: Biseparable decomposition of two-copy three-qubit isotropic GHZ states

In this appendix we analyse which values of the parameter p allow for a biseparable decomposition of two copies of the three-qubit isotropic GHZ states. To be more precise, we look for a biseparable decomposition w.r.t. the partition A1B1 A2B2 A3B3 of the state 3(p)2, where

3(p) = p

GHZ3GHZ3

+

(1

1 23

123

(A1)

is the three-qubit isotropic GHZ state from Eq. (3).
To construct a biseparable decomposition, we first
find separable states defined on two- or four-qubit sub-
spaces. We then extend these states in different ways
and group them together to define biseparable states for
the whole six-qubit system. This allows us to rewrite the state 3(p)2 as a convex sum of these biseparable states and a diagonal matrix. Finally, we find conditions
for which this diagonal matrix has only non-negative
entries, i.e., is positive semi-definite and thus itself a
state. In the following the subsystems are reordered from A1A2A3B1B2B3 to A1B1A2B2A3B3.
The two-qubit state

(A2)

is biseparable, as it can be rewritten in the form

(A3)

Every two-qubit subsystem CD  A1B1A2B2A3B3 is spanned by a set of the form
{ 00i1i2i3i4 , 01i1i2i3i4 , 10i1i2i3i4 , 11i1i2i3i4}, with ij fixed, or a permutation of the entries thereof. The indices m1m2m3m4 going form 1 to 64 define a two-qubit subsystem uniquely and we can write the
state (m1, m2, m3, m4) = CD  i1i2i3i4i1i2i3i4 CD , where i1, . . . , i4 have to be chosen appropriately. Note that not all combinations m1m2m3m4 define a two-qubit subspace and among all subspaces we only use those
pertaining to different parties. This is the case in the
following definitions

shared between three parties. It can be split in three
different ways:  ,  A1B1A2A3 A1A2B2A3 and A1A2A3B3 . Next, we define the biseparable six-qubit state

with

~iA~2 = Nj=2 iAj for i = 0, 1, 1A~2 = i=0,1 ~i~i and

1A~2 = 12N-1 - 1A~2 . We are now interested in checking for

which values of p the partial transpose of the two-qubit

state

~
A1

A~2

is positive semi-definite.

Since the normal-

isation is irrelevant for this calculation, we can instead

consider the partial transpose of the unnormalised oper-

ator

and

we

find

that

~
A1

A~2

is

positive

semi-definite for p  pcrit = 1 (1 + 2N-1).

Since

~
A1

A~2

is a two-qubit state, the PPT criterion is necessary and

sufficient for separability, and the state (p) hence has a

separable decomposition with respect to the bipartition

A1 A2 . . . AN for p  pcrit.

Since (p) is invariant under exchanges of any qubits, this separability threshold applies for any bipartition
of separating any one qubit from the remaining N - 1 qubits. Moreover, it is easy to see that the arguments
presented above hold also for any bipartition into M and
N -M qubits by choosing suitable single-qubit subspaces in both the M -qubit and (M - N )-qubit Hilbert spaces.

We also note that the threshold value pcrit for partial separability trivially coincides with the PPT threshold
for any chosen bipartition of (p) because the only nondiagonal 2 × 2-block of the partial transpose is always of the form of the right-hand side of Eq. (B2). In particu-
lar, this implies that all states (p) are NPT entangled across any bipartition for p > pcrit and separable below this value. Consequently, there are no PPT entangled
isotropic GHZ states.

Appendix C: PPT-triangle states and GME activation

The terms (1 - p)2 and 1 - 6p + 31 3p2 are positive for all values of p. The term 1-10 3p+7 3p2 is non-negative for p  3 7 and p  1 and finally the term 1 -2p - 13 3p2 is non-negative for (3 - 4 3) 13  p  (3 + 4 3) 13. With this we have found a biseparable decomposition for all values -1 7  p  (3 + 4 3) 13. From Eq. (10) we know that all values above this bound are already GME.

To investigate whether multi-copy GME activation is possible from bound entanglement, we first consider a biseparable three-party state with no distillable bipartite entanglement across any bipartition, i.e., the state is positive under partial transposition across all cuts. Since the set of PPT states is convex, we may construct such a state as a convex combination of terms where one party

8

is uncorrelated with the others, while the remaining two parties share a PPT entangled state, i.e.,

A1 A2 A3

(C1)

where

i pi

=

0

and

PPT
Ai Aj

for

i, j



{1, 2, 3}

are

PPT entangled states. Here we note that the existence

of such a decomposition guarantees biseparability, but

it does not a priori rule out that such a state may be

partially (or even fully) separable. If A1A2A3 is separable with respect to one or several of the bipartitions

A1 A2A3, A1A2 A3 and A2 A1A3, then GME activation

is not possible for any number of copies. However, as we

show

here,

for

certain

choices

of

the

PPT
Ai Aj

and

Ak ,

three

copies of A1A2A3 are GME, which indirectly also shows

that the single-copy states in question are not partially

(or fully) separable.

To continue, let us consider the particular situation

where each of the three parties Ai for i = 1, 2, 3 consists

of

three

subsystems

A(j)
i

for

j

= 1, 2, 3.

In

this

situation,

a particular example for a state of the form of Eq. (C1)

is given by

and

All other

of A1A2A3 allow the parties to establish a state of the form

(C3)

via LOCC. For ease of notation we have dropped the

superscripts identifying the particular subsystems, e.g.,

using

the

instead

of

A(j)
i

.

We

call

a

state

in

this

form a PPT-triangle state, where the parties O1, O2, and

O3 have access to systems B1C1, A2C2, and A3B3, respec-

tively. We further note that every such PPT-triangle

state can be created via LOCC from three copies of a

biseparable state of the form of Eq. (C1).

Therefore, we reach the following claim: if there is a GME state that is PPT-triangle, then multi-copy GME activation is achievable for (some) biseparable states that are PPT across every cut. Consequently, the problem reduces to proving the existence of a PPT-triangle state that exhibits GME. To find such a state, we construct a

one-parameter family of two-qutrit states given by

PPT
XY

(p)

=

1 Np

( 00 + 11 + 22)(00 + 11 + 22 )

+ p( 0101 + 1212 + 2020 )

+

1 p

respectively,

and

3

each thrice degenerate, and PXPYT(p) is hence PPT. We

can then choose the PPT states in Eq. (C3) from this

family of two-qutrit states, such that

(C5)

To show that the state is GME with respect to the par-

tition O1 O2 O1 it suffices to detect GME between sub-

spaces D1, D2, and D3 of O1, O2, and O3, respectively.

Specifically, we consider the single-qutrit subspaces D1,

D2, and D3 spanned by { iiB1C1 }i=0,1,2, { jjA2C2 }j=0,1,2,

and { kkA3B3 }k=0,1,2, respectively, and thus the projec-

tion

of

PPT
O1 O2 O3

(x,

,

z

)

onto

the

three-qutrit

subspace

spanned by { iiB1C1  jjA2C2  kkA3B3 }i,j,k=0,1,2. We

denote

the

resulting

state

by

PPT
D1 D2 D3

(x,

y,

z).

To this state, we apply a three-party GME witness

W3 (see [22, example 2]) based on the lifted Choi-map witnesses from [23] of the form
