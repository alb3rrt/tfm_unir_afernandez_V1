We compute the two-loop four-point form factor of a length-3 half-BPS operator in planar N = 4 SYM, which belongs to the class of two-loop five-point scattering observables with one off-shell colorsinglet leg. A new bootstrapping strategy is developed to obtain this result by starting with an ansatz expanded in terms of master integrals and then solving the master coefficients via various physical constraints. We find that consistency conditions of infrared divergences and collinear limits, together with the cancellation of spurious poles, can fix a significant part of the ansatz. The remaining degrees of freedom can be fixed by one simple type of two-double unitarity cut. Full analytic results in terms of both symbol and Goncharov polylogarithms are provided.

INTRODUCTION

Past two decades have seen tremendous progress in our understanding of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theories (QFTs), where the study of the maximally supersymmetric N = 4 super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory has been particularly beneficial, see e.g. [1, 2]. These developments not only reveal rich mathematical structures in the formal aspects of QFTs, but also have important phenomenological applications such as in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). At the moment, two-loop corrections for 2  3 processes have been at the frontier of amplitude computations which are under intense studies in last couple of years: based on the advancements of integral computations [3­8], a number of amplitudes have been obtained in compact analytic form, including all massless cases [9­24] and a two-loop five-point amplitude with one massive vector boson [25].
In this work we present an analytic computation of a two-loop four-point form factor in planar N = 4 SYM, which may be understood as a supersymmetric version of the two-loop Higgs-plus-four-parton scattering, see e.g. [26]. This provides the first example of two-loop fivepoint amplitudes with one color-singlet massive external leg. Concretely, the two-loop four-point form factor is defined as a matrix element between a color-singlet halfBPS operator tr(312) and four on-shell states:

F4 = Ftr(312)(1, 2, 3, 4+; q)

(1)

= dDxe-iq·x (p1)(p2)(p3)g+(p4)|tr(312)(x)|0 ,

where p2i = 0 and q2 = (

4 i=1

pi)2

=

0.

See [27] for a

recent review of form factors in N = 4 SYM.

As another important aspect of this work, we develop

a new bootstrap strategy, based on the fact that any

loop correction of amplitudes or form factors can be ex-

panded in terms of a finite set of basis integrals, such as

the integration-by-part (IBP) master integrals [28, 29]. Explicitly, an l-loop amplitude can be written as:

F (l),ansatz =

Ci Ii(l) ,

(2)

i

where Ii(l) are the IBP master integrals, and the coefficients Ci contain the intrinsic physical information which are the main goal of the computation.
Unlike the usual method of starting with a loop integrand following by IBP reduction, the bootstrap strategy we use is to start directly with the general ansatz form (2), followed by determining the result through various physical constraints. In this way, one can avoid complicated intermediate steps, such as integrand construction and IBP reduction, and reach the final result in a compact form more directly. To fix the coefficients Ci we apply constraints from the general properties of physical quantities, including: (i) the universal infrared (IR) divergences, (ii) the collinear factorization properties, (iii) the cancellation of spurious poles, and (iv) constraints of unitarity cuts. More details will be given later.
We point out that similar ideas have been also developed for computing amplitudes [30­42] and form factors [26, 43] based on the symbol techniques [44]. Comparing to the symbol bootstrap, the main difference here is that we start with a set of master integrals. On one hand, this requires the knowledge of master integrals and thus contains more input information than the symbol bootstrap. On the other hand, the master integrals are theory-independent and can in principle be applied to general observables in general theories. Moreover, in the ansatz (2), one can apply physical constraints that are not available in symbol bootstrap, such as IR and unitarity-cut constraints. In particular it can be used to explain the observed maximal transcendentality equivalence for two-loop three-point or minimal form factors and Higgs amplitudes [26, 45­47]. Once the ansatz coefficients are obtained, it is also possible to obtain the result

2

of higher order expansion in dimensional regularization parameter  = (4 - D)/2.
In this paper we describe this strategy and illustrate its application for the two-loop four-point form factor. A few technical points are given in the supplemental material, and full analytic results are provided in the ancillary files.

ANSATZ OF THE FORM FACTOR

For constructing the two-loop ansatz, it is instructive to first review the tree and one-loop results [48]. The treelevel result takes the simple form as

F4(0) = Ft(r0()312)(1, 2, 3, 4+) =

31 34 41

.

(3)

For the one-loop form factor, we make an important observation that it can be reorganized in the following form

F4(1) = F4(0)I4(1) = F4(0) B1 G1(1) + B2 G2(1) , (4)

where Ba are cross ratios of spinor products

B1 =

B2 =

,

B1 + B2 = 1 , (5)

and Ga(1) can be given in terms of bubble and box master
integrals (see the supplemental material). Besides man-
ifesting the symmetry of (p1  p3), the form of (4) has following important properties: (a) B1  0, B2  1 when p3 p4; (b) G1 and G2 satisfy

,

(6)

which will be used for the two-loop constraints later. Inspired by the one-loop structure, we propose the fol-
lowing ansatz of two-loop planar form factor

F4(2) = F4(0)I4(2) = F4(0) B1 G1(2) + B2 G2(2) , (7)

which is also suggested by the BDS ansatz we will discuss below. The loop function Ga(2) can be expanded in terms of a set of two-loop master integrals. Topologies with maximal number of propagators are shown in Fig. 1. Note that because the operator contains 3 scalar fields, its associated massive q-leg (denoted by blue color) should be connected to a 4-vertex. Since the BPS form factor in N = 4 SYM has uniform transcendentality degree 4, it is convenient to choose the master integrals to be uniformly transcendental (UT) integrals. Such a basis has been constructed in [7] based on the canonical differential equations method [49], which we will follow in this paper. An analysis of the topology shows that the most

general ansatz contains 221 master integrals for each Ga(2), namely,

221

Ga(2) =

ca,iIi(2),UT ,

(8)

i=1

where ca,i are the coefficients to be solved. The (p1  p3) symmetry of the form factor requires that:

G2(2) = G1(2)|(p1p3) ,

(9)

thus c1,i and c2,i are not independent. Since both the form factor and integral basis have degree 4, the coefficients ca,i are expected to be pure rational numbers independent of dimensional regularization parameter .
To summarize, our ansatz contains 221 free parameters which are to be solved by imposing physical constraints.

PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS

As mentioned in the introduction, the central idea of bootstrap is to constrain the result by general physical properties. We outline the constrains below, and further implementations to the two-loop form factor will be given in next section.
Two important constraints are the universal IR divergences [50, 51] and collinear factorization [52­54], which depend only on lower loop results and some universal building blocks. For the planar amplitudes or form factors in N = 4 SYM, a convenient representation to capture both the IR and collinear behavior is the BDS expansion [55]

I(2) =

1 2

I (1) ()

2 + f (2)()I(1)(2) + R(2) + O() ,

(10)

where f (2)() = -22 - 23 - 242. Both the IR and collinear singularities are contained in the first two terms
which are determined by one-loop corrections, and the n-point finite remainder function R(2) has nice regular behavior R(n2)  R(n2-) 1 in the collinear limit pi pi+1.
For the form factor we consider, one complication is that I() contains two kinematic factors B1 and B2, and the (I(1))2 will introduce quadratic terms of Ba with dou-
ble pole of 13 24 . It turns out that, one can introduce
a BDS ansatz function that is linear in Ba as

I4(2,B) DS =

FIG. 2: Dual periodic Wilson line configuration for the 4-point form factor in momentum twistor space.

Using (6) and the property of Ba, one can prove that IB(2D)S captures the full 2-loop IR and collinear singularities, and the following defined finite remainder has nice collinear behavior (note that one collinear leg should be gluon)

R(42-p) t :=

I4(2) - I4(2,B) DS

O(0)

---p-4 --p--3  or p4 p1

R(32-p) t ,

(12)

where R(32-p)t is the two-loop remainder of three-point form factor Ftr(312)(1, 2, 3) [56].
A further useful constraint is that all spurious poles
(i.e. unphysical poles) must cancel in the full result. In
the form factor (7), Ba factors contain a spurious pole 24 , which can be seen from the following equivalent representation of I4(2)

I4(2)

=

1 2

G1(2) + G2(2)

+

B1

- 2

B2

G1(2) - G2(2)

. (13)

When 24  0, B1 - B2 will go to infinity as 1/ 24 , the
cancellation of the pole implies the following constraint on Ga(2) as

G1(2) - G2(2) --2-4--------1 O() .

(14)

While above constraints can often fix a significant part of the parameters, there are in general some parameters left which require further constraints. This is indeed the case for the 4-point form factor we consider. To fix them we will use the constraint of unitarity cuts [53, 57, 58]. Although unitarity cuts can in principle determine the full result, we would like to stress that after using IR, collinear and spurious pole constraints, only few simple unitarity cuts are needed to fix the remaining degrees of freedom, as we will shown in next section.

Collinear limit of form factors
Before applying the above constraints, we discuss the collinear limit for form factors using dual periodic Wilson line in the dual momentum space [59­61]. The dual coordinates xi can be defined as
xi - xi+1 = pi = i i , xi - xi = xi - x¯i = q , (15)

and corresponding momentum twistors [62, 63] can be defined as

ZiA = (i , µi ) ,

µi = xi · i = xi+1 · i . (16)

The configuration for the four-point form factor is shown in Fig. 2.
Momentum twistor variables are convenient for parametrizing collinear limits. Consider the limit p4 p3, analogous to the amplitude case [64], one can parametrize the twistor variable Z4 as:

Z4 = Z3 + 

¯1¯213 ¯1¯212

Z2 +  

¯2123 ¯1¯212

Z¯1 + 

¯1123 ¯1¯212

Z¯2 ,

(17)

where the ratio of four brackets are introduced to balance the twistor weight. The collinear limit can be achieved by taking first   0, followed by   0. The parameter  is finite which physically corresponds to the momentum fraction shared by particle 4 in the limit. Because of the periodicity condition, the same limit applies simultaneously to Z4, Z¯4. Using (16), the spinor variables satisfy a similar relation as

4 = 3 + 

¯1¯213 ¯1¯212

2 +  

¯2123 ¯1¯212

¯1 + 

¯1123 ¯1¯212

¯2 ,

(18)

as well as for 4, ¯4. Given this parametrization, one can obtain collinear limit of any kinematic variable of four-
point form factors.

SOLVING THE ANSATZ

Now we implement the constraints to solve for the coefficients in the ansatz (8). To simplify the computation in each step, we will first apply of the constraints at symbol level and then at the level of functions.
The symbol was introduced in [44] to greatly simplify the two-loop six-gluon amplitudes. It can be understood as a mathematical tool to simplify transcendental functions into tensor products of function arguments, for simple examples: S(log(x)) = x, S(Li2(x)) = -(1 - x)  x. A brief review of symbol is given in the supplemental material. For the problem at hand, the symbol expressions of all two-loop masters have been obtained in [7]. Substituting them into our ansatz (7), we obtain an -expansion form of the form factor:

Sym(I4(2)) =

k-4

I (c) ki=1 wIi ,

k0

I

(19)

where wI are rational functions of kinematic variables and are called symbol letters. For the 221 master integrals we consider, there are 46 independent letters. Their explicit definition and the collinear limit behavior are given in the supplemental material. I (c) are linear combinations of ca,i in (8) which are to be constrained as below.

(d) Unitarity cuts

FIG. 3: Fig. (a)-(c) are master integrals related to remaining 10 free parameters. All of them can be
determined by the unitarity cuts in Fig. (d).

First, the divergent parts must reproduce that of I4(2,B) DS in (11). By matching (19) with Sym(I4(2,B) DS) at 1/m orders with m = 4, 3, 2, 1, one can solve for 139 of ca,i. Next, after subtracting the BDS part, the finite remainder in collinear limits should match with the 3-point result as (12), which fixes 44 parameters. Furthermore, the absence of spurious pole 24 implies the constraint (14) on Ga(2). Applying this constraint at symbol level up to finite order, the remaining degree of freedom is 22.
The symbol does not concern the terms that contain transcendental numbers such as , n. It is therefore worth considering the full function of the master integrals [8]. Practically, to fix the coefficients, it is convenient to do numerical computation with high enough precision (see next section for more discussion on numerics). Consider further the IR and then collinear constrains at function level, the degrees of freedom are reduced to 17 and then 10. The spurious pole condition (14) is automatically satisfied up to finite order and does not provide any new constraint.
We find that all terms depending on remaining 10 parameters are related to three kinds of master integrals: IBUPTb(i, j, k, l), ITUPT(i, j, k, l), and IdUBTox2c(i, j, k, l), whose topologies are given in Fig. 3. Interestingly, their numerators are all proportional to tr5 × µij, where

tr5 = 4iµpµ1 p2 p3p4 ,

(20)

and µij = -i 2 · -j 2 is related to the components of

the loop momenta beyond four dimensions. These terms

can be organized as

10 i=1

xiG~i,

where

xi

parameters and

G~1 =ITUPT(1, 2, 3, 4) + ITUPT(3, 2, 1, 4) ,

(21)

G~2 =IBUPTb(1, 2, 3, 4) - IBUPTb(4, 3, 2, 1) + (p1  p3) ,

G~3 =B1IdUBTox2c(1, 2, 3, 4) + B2IdUBTox2c(3, 2, 1, 4) ,

together with other G~i given by cyclic permutations. All G~i functions are free of IR divergences and vanish in the collinear limit, and they are also free of spurious pole up
to finite order; thus they are not constrained in the above procedure. Additionally, the integrals IdUBTox2c are of O() order, so they are irrelevant if one is only interested in getting the 0 order of the form factor. All these master coefficients can be fixed by the single type of two-double
cuts shown by Fig. 3(d), given by the product of three

in which the UT numerators are indicated. The integral ITUPT has a few nice properties: (1) It starts from O(0) order and has no double propagator; (2) The final form
factor solution shows that the two masters on the RHS of (22) precisely combine into ITUPT, suggesting the latter to be a more physical choice. Thus we use ITUPT to replace the first integral on the RHS of (22) in the 221 master
basis.
We summarize the steps of applying constraints and
the remaining parameters after each constraint in Table I.
All master coefficients, up to the spinor factors Ba, are small rational numbers, and the full solution is provided
in the ancillary file.
As cross checks, we have also applied a spanning set
of D-dimensional unitarity cuts and find full consistency
with the bootstrap result.

FULL FORM FACTOR AND REMAINDER
The full analytic form factor can be obtained in terms of Goncharov polylogarithm functions (GPL) using the analytic expressions of masters [8]. We recall that the result is determined by seven independent Lorentz invariants: six parity-even Mandelstam variables sij = (pi +pj)2 and one parity-odd variable tr5 (only the sign of tr5 matters). In GPLs given in [8], a special set of function letters are used based on the SDE approach [65], where a transformation is used to simplify the differential equations. A brief discussion of the kinematics in GPLs are given in the supplemental material.
In Table II, we give a numerical data point evaluated via GiNaC [66] through the Mathematica interface provided by PolyLogTools [67]. The result is cross-checked

by computations via FIESTA [68] and pySecDec [69]. Other numerical data points which check the collinear limit and spurious pole cancellation are also given in the supplemental material.
Below we discuss the two-loop finite remainder and focus on the property of its symbol. The two-loop remainder has degree 4 and its symbol can be expressed in terms of tensor:

Sym(R(42-p) t) =

ciwi1  wi2  wi3  wi4 ,

i

(23)

where wi are symbol letters. We find that as expected for the BPS form factors in N = 4 SYM [26], the remain-
der are function of dimensionless ratios of Lorentz variables. One can introduce uij = sij/q2, uijk = sijk/q2, thus the letter q2 will never appear in the remain-
der. Besides, three more letters: 3,1234, 3,1423 and tr5 which appear in master integrals, also cancel in the finite remainder, similar to the observation in [25]. Here 3,ijkl = -Gram(pi + pj, pk + pl) and tr25 = Gram(p1, p2, p3, p4) are all related to Gram determinants.
To give some details about letters in each entry: (1)
the first-entry contains 8 letters, corresponding to phys-
ical poles ui,i+1 and ui,i+1,i+2; (2) the second entry is free from {X1, Y1, Y2, Z, u13, u24}, and there are 28 letters; (3) third entry contains all 42 letters except u123; (4) the last-entry is free from {X1, X2, Z, uijk, 1 - uijk, u12 - u123, u23 - u123}, and there are 22 letters. Explicit definitions of Xi, Yi, Z can be found in the supplemental material.
The expressions of remainder symbol and the form fac-
tor function (in GPLs) are provided in the ancillary files.

DISCUSSION

develop a new bootstrap strategy based on an ansatz of IBP master-integral expansion.
Unlike the traditional Feynman diagrams computation, the bootstrap strategy allows constructing the result by using physical constraints directly. For the form factor we consider, after applying IR, collinear and spurious pole constraints, one only needs a simple type of unitarity cut to fix the full result. Our strategy is different from the usual symbol bootstrap as the latter starts from pure symbols, while here we take the advantage of known master integrals. This indeed contains more input comparing to the symbol bootstrap, but it also has the advantage of using constraints from IR and unitarity cuts that are not available in the latter. Besides, the result may be used to extract the information of O() orders.
Since our ansatz uses theory-independent basis integrals, the strategy in principle can be used for loop amplitudes and form factors in general theories. It would be thus very interesting to consider more general observables based on this method. One application is that it can be used to explain the observed universal maximally transcendental parts for form factors [26, 46, 47, 56, 70­ 79]. For example, applying our strategy for the two-loop minimal form factors, it turns out that IR constraint alone is enough to fix the maximally transcendental part; since the maximally transcendental part of IR divergence is universal (i.e. theroy-independent), this explains the equality between the results of N  4 SYM and QCD. Similar argument together with further constraints can be applied to the 2-loop 3-point form factor with stress tensor multiplet. More details will be given in [80].
An important direction would be exploring other physical constraints such as OPE limits [81­83] and Regge limits [84­86]. Based on the recent progress of form factor OPE [87, 88], symbol bootstrap has been used to construct a 3-point form factor up to five loops in planar N = 4 SYM [43]. It would be very interesting to extend these studies for more general form factors. Given more analytic results, it would be also interesting to explore possible hidden symmetries for form factors, for example, the Q¯-like equation [89, 90], as well as the structure in the context of cluster algebras [91].

Supplemental material

A. One-loop form factor

The one-loop four-point form factor can be given as

F4(1) = F4(0)I4(1) = F4(0) B1 G1(1) + (p1  p3) , (24)

where B1 is defined in (5), and

G1(1)

=

+ IB(1u)b,UblTe(4, 1) - IB(1u)b,UblTe(2, 3) .

(25)

Here IB(1o)x,UT and IB(1u)b,UblTe are one-loop one-mass box and bubble UT integrals:

B. A brief review of symbol

The symbol S of a function T (k) of transcendentality k is represented in a tensor product form as [44]

S(T (k)) =

wi1  · · ·  wik ,

i1 ,...,ik

(28)

where wi are rational functions of kinematic variables. Rational function has transcendentality degree 0, and by definition, its symbol is zero.
In practice, the symbol can be derived in the following recursive way. Given the total derivative of T (k) in the form

dT (k) =

Ti(k-1)d log wi ,

i

(29)

the symbol satisfies the following recursive relation

S(T (k)) = S(Ti(k-1))  wi .
i

(30)

From above definition, one can see that the tensor product of wi should more properly be understood as tensor product of log wi:

ki=1 wi - ki=1 log wi .

(31)

This immediately leads to the important properties for the symbol that like the product of logarithms:

· · ·  wiwj  · · · = · · ·  wi  · · · + · · ·  wj  · · · . (32)

From the definition, it is also clear that for any constant c,

· · ·  c wi  · · · = · · ·  wi  · · · .

(33)

Let us mention other two useful properties that will be useful for the computation. One important fact is that not all symbols correspond to symbols of functions. To be able to mapped to certain functions, a given symbol must satisfy the so-called "integrability condition" that for any two consecutive entries of symbols:

wi1  · · ·  wia  wia+1  · · ·  wik
i1 ,...,ik



(log wia  log wia+1 )wi1  · · ·  · · ·  wik = 0 ,

i1 ,...,ik

(34)

for all a = 1, . . . , k - 1. Another useful property is that

the symbol of the product of functions can be constructed

from the shuffle product of symbols of functions:

¡ S(TA TB) = S(TA) S(TB) .

(35)

More precisely, given S(TA) = m =1w and S(TB) = n=1w, one has

¡ S(TA TB) =

m i=+1nw(i) ,

(i){} {}

(36)

¡ where {} {} is the shuffle product of {} and {},
i.e. the ordered product that preserves the ordering of
{} and {} within the merged list.
Finally, let use give some simple examples, we have

S(pure numbers) = S(rational functions) = 0 , (37)

S(log(x)) = x ,

(38)

S(log(xy)) = x  y + y  x ,

(39)

S(Lik(x)) = -(1 - x)  x  · · ·  x . (40)

k-1 times

The last relation can be obtained using the definition of classical polylogarithms

x
Lik(x) = Lik-1(t)d log t , Li1(z) = - log(1 - z) .
0

C. Symbol letters

We discuss the letters that appear in the symbol of the UT master integrals [7]. The remainder functions of halfBPS form factors in N = 4 preserve scale invariance and are function of dimensionless ratios of Mandelstam variables [26]. We introduce ratio variables

uij

=

sij s1234

,

uijk

=

sijk s1234

.

(41)

9

There are only five independent ratio variables, which can be chosen as five of uij:

{u12, u23, u34, u14, u13, u24} , u12 + u23 + u34 + u14 + u13 + u24 = 1 .

(42)

We can separate the letters that appear in the remainder into two parts. The first part are simple u variables or the linear combinations of them:

u12, u13, u14, u23, u24, u34, u123, u124, u134, u234,
u123 - u12, u123 - u23, u124 - u12, u124 - u14, u134 - u14, u134 - u34, u234 - u23, u234 - u34,
1 - u123, 1 - u124, 1 - u134, 1 - u234 .

(43)

They correspond to W2, . . . , W21 in [7]. To introduce the second part, we define variables:

x±ijkl

=

1

+ uij

- ukl

± 2uij

3,ijkl/s1234 ,

yi±jkl

=

uij ukl

- uikujl

+

uilujk ± P (ijkl)tr5/(s1234)2 2uij uil

,

zi±jk±l = 1 + yi±jkl - x±lijk ,

(44)

where P (ijkl) is the signature of the permutation with canonical order (1234), 3 also appears in 3-massive triangle integral

3,ijkl = -Gram(pi + pj , pk + pl) = (q2 - sij - skl)2 - 4sij skl ,

(45)

and in our convention the odd kinematics tr5 can be treated as tr5 = 12 [23] 34 [41] - [12] 23 [34] 41 , relating to Gram determinant as

tr25 = 5 = Gram(p1, p2, p3, p4) = (s12s34 + s14s23 - s13s24)2 - 4s12s23s34s14 . (46)

Given these definition, we introduce following letters that will occur in the remainder:

U (pi + pj , pk + pl) = uiklujkl - ukl ,

X1(pi

+ pj, pk, pl)

=

uij x+ijkl uij x-ijkl

- uijl - uijl

,

X2(pi

+ pj, pk

+

pl)

=

x+ijkl x-ijkl

,

Y1(pi, pj , pk, pl)

=

yi+jkl yi-jkl

,

Y2(pi, pj , pk, pl)

=

yi+jkl yi-jkl

+1 +1

,

Z(pi, pj, pk, pl)

=

zi+jk+l zi-jk-l zi+jk-l zi-jk+l

.

(47) (48) (49) (50) (51) (52)

They satisfy relations:

X1(pi

+ pj, pk, pl)

=

X1(pi

1 + pj, pl, pk)

,

(53)

Y1(pi, pj , pk, pl)

=

1 Y1(pk, pj , pi, pl)

=

Y1(pj

,

1 pk,

pl,

pi)

,

Y2(pi, pj , pk, pl)

=

1 Y2(pi, pl, pk, pj )

= Y2(pk, pj , pi, pl)Y1(pi, pj, pk, pl),

Z(pi, pj, pk, pl) = Z(pk, pl, pi, pj)

= Z(pj, pi, pk, pl) = Z(pi, pj, pl, pk).

We list the letters that occur in our result explicitly:

X1(p1 + p2, p3, p4), X1(p2 + p3, p4, p1),

X1(p1 + p4, p2, p3), X1(p3 + p4, p1, p2),

X2(p1 + p2, p3 + p4), X2(p2 + p3, p1 + p4),

X2(p1 + p4, p2 + p3), X2(p3 + p4, p1 + p2),

U (p1 + p2, p3 + p4), U (p2 + p3, p1 + p4),

(54)

U (p1 + p4, p2 + p3), U (p3 + p4, p1 + p2),

Y1(p1, p2, p3, p4), Y1(p1, p3, p2, p4)

Y2(p1, p3, p2, p4), Y2(p3, p1, p2, p4),

Y2(p1, p3, p4, p2), Y2(p3, p1, p4, p2),

Z(p1, p2, p3, p4), Z(p3, p2, p1, p4).

They are related to the letters Wi defined in [7] as follows:

X1 : {W37, W38, W39, W54}, X2 : {W33, W34, W35, W36}, U : {W22, W23, W24, W51}, Y1(p1, p2, p3, p4) : W40, Z(p3, p2, p1, p4) : W47, Y2, Y1(p1, p3, p2, p4) : W41  W46.

(55)

To summarize: there are in total 42 letters given in (43) and (54) that appear in the remainder function. For the 221 master integrals, there are four extra letters to consider

q2 , 3,1234 , 3,1423 , tr5 ,

(56)

giving in total 46 letters.

D. Collinear limit of letters
As discussed in the main text, to consider the collinear limit of form factors, it is convenient to use the momentum twistor variables [62, 63], based on the periodic Wilson line picture [59­61].
Consider the 4-point form factor, where the dual periodic Wilson line configuration in momentum twistor space is shown in Fig. 2. The basic letters ui,i+1 =

10

x2i,i+2/x2i,i+4 and ui,i+1,i+2 = x2i,i+2/x2i-1,i+3, can be represented by momentum twistor as

ui,i+1 =

i - 1, i, i + 1, i + 2 i - 1, i, i + 3, i + 4

i + 3, i + 4 i + 1, i + 2

,

ui-1,i,i+1 =

i - 1, i, i + 2, i + 3 i - 1, i, i + 3, i + 4

i + 3, i + 4 i + 2, i + 3

,

(57)

where the abbreviation for the four-brackets is used

ZiZjZkZl = ijkl .

(58)

The y± variables can be given in spinor form as

yi+jkl =

l|k|j] l|i|j]

,

yi-jkl =

j|k|l] j|i|l]

,

(59)

and can be given as

y1+234 =

1234 4123

,

yi-jkl

=

ujk ukl uij uil

yi+jkl

-1
,

(60)

y1+324 =

1

u23

B2 u123 - u12 - u23

,

y3+124 =

y1+324

p1 p3

,

y1+342 =

1

u34

B1 u134 - u14 - u34

,

y3+142 =

y1+342

Now we discuss the collinear limit for the kinematic variables and the letters. For convenience of notation, we introduce a new variable t as:



=

t

- 1 s12 t s12

+ s13 + s23

.

(61)

From (17)-(18) one has

.

Keeping

the leading term in the collinear limit, the u variables

behave as

u12  u^12 , u14  tu^13 , u24  tu^23 , u234  u^23 , u341  u^13 ,

u23  (1 - t)u^23 , u34  -u^13u^23 , u13  (1 - t)u^13 , u123  1 - t(u^13 + u^23) , u412  u^12 + t(u^13 + u^23) ,

(62)

where {u^12, u^23, u^13} represent the variables of the 3point form factor obtained in the collinear limit.
For yi±jkl, because tr±(1234)  0 when p3 p4, one needs to take the collinear limit carefully using momen-
tum twistor variables as (17)-(18), which give:

The collinear limit of x±ijkl seems a little subtle, since 3 can not be treated as momentum twistor. Fortu-
nately, their limit are finite

F. Kinematics and evaluation of GPL functions

Master integrals has been obtained in Goncharov polylogarithms (GPLs) in [8]. The GPLs are given in terms of a new set of variables {x, S12, S23, S34, S45, S51}. In the ancillary files, we provide the explicit expressions of the relevant function letters. We briefly review the definition of these variables below, following [8].
The new variables are related to {q1, q2, q3, q4, q5} with q1 massive, through following relations:

s~15 = (1 - x)S45 + S23x ,

(66)

q12 = (1 - x)(S45 - S12x) ,

s~12 = (S34 - S12(1 - x))x ,

s~23 = S45 , s~34 = S51x , s~34 = S51x .

where s~ij = (qi + qj)2. To evaluate the master integrals out of Euclidean re-
gions, proper analytic continuation is needed. The rule is to give each positive kinematics a small positive imaginary part ix, then it will lead to two solutions of {x, S12, S23, S34, S45, S51}, and which one should be chosen is determined by the following condition

(-s~15)- = (-S45)-

S45 - S23 S45x

(67)

(-q12)- = (1 - x)-(-S45)-

,

(-s~34)- = (-S51)-x- , (-s~45)- = (-S12)-x-2 .

The form factor in the main text is obtained by replacing {q1, q2, q3, q4, q5} with momentum {q, pi, pj, pk, pl} for

11

each master integrals, then {S12, S23, S34, S45, S51} are transformed into kinematics si,i+1 and sijk in our result. Finally, the GPLs can be evaluated by GiNaC efficiently to high precision.
Below we comment on the subtle point about ambiguities for two types of integral expressions given in [8]:
 a. Integrals with numerator proportional to 3:
ITUBTub3b and ITUTT4(see the ancillary file). For a set of kinematics {s~ij} one will find 2 sets of solutions {x±, S1±2, S2±3, S3±4, S4±5, S5±1} by solving (66), we give x± here:

x± = s~23 + s~45 - q12 ±

(s~23 + 2s~23

s~45

-

4s~23 s~45

.

(68)

The integrals will have negative sign if one chooses

ambiguity

b. Integrals with numerators proportional to tr5:

IBUPTb, ITUPT and IdUBTox2c(see the ancillary file). In

the GPLs of master integrals we use, the letters l13 and l15 contain square root term 1, where

l13, l15 and 1 are defined in Appendix A of [8],

and one can find 5 = ence, the simplification

tr25 = 5

x21. In1

the referhas been

done for the letters, which may bring a error in the

sign of those integrals when x is a complex num-

ber. However, mapping 1

corrected by infinitesimal

analytic continuation of 5 is



5 + iax =

+ 5,

5 > 0 ,

+Sgn(a) -5, 5 < 0

(69)

 and the additional sign factor Sgn( 5 + iax/tr5) is needed to add for each odd master integrals.

Another potential ambiguity is that, we note the
convention of µaijnc in the ancillary file of [7, 8] is different from µij = -i 2 · -j 2 as µij = -16µaijnc, the correct expressions of µij is given in ancillary
file.

s13 = 3, s24 = 10-20, tr5 > 0}.

consistency requirement is that the four-point finite remainder R(42-p)t should reduce to the 2-loop 3-point remainder [56] R(32-p)t(s^12, s^23, s^13) with

s^12 = s12 = 24/5 ,

s^23 = s23 + s24 = 17/10 ,

s^13 = s13 + s14 = 9/10 .

(71)

Indeed, we find that the difference is

R(32-p)t - R(42-p)t = (1.9834 × 10-37 + 9.6168 × 10-18i)   .

G. Numerical check for the collinear limit and spurious pole cancellation

Here we provide two numerical data points, one is related to the collinear limit and the other is relation to the check of spurious pole cancellation.
First, we consider the collinear limit p3 p4. In this limit the kinematics behave as

{ 34 , [34] , tr5}   ,

(70)

where   1. Such a numerical data point and the corresponding form factor result are given in Table III. A

Next, we consider the spurious pole cancellation, which requires that (B1 - B2)(G1(2) - G2(2)) should be finite when 24  0. To get the kinematics corresponding to the limit 24  0, one can take s24 = ^ with ^  1, and also choose tr5 = s14s23 - s12s34 + O(^) (only the sign of
tr5 matters), such that

B1 - B2

=

s12s34 - s14s23 - tr5 s13 s24



1 ^

.

(72)

Such a numerical data point and the corresponding result are given in Table IV, where one finds the spurious pole indeed cancels.
