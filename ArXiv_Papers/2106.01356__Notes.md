## Abstract

We construct examples of centrally harmonic spaces by generalizing work of Copson and Ruse. We show that these examples are generically not centrally harmonic at other points. We use this construction to exhibit manifolds which are not conformally flat but such that their density function agrees with Euclidean space.
