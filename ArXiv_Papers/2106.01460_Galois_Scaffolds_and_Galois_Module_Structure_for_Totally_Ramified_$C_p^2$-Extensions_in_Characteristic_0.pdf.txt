Abstract
Recently, much work has been done to investigate Galois module structure of local field extensions, particularly through the use of Galois scaffolds. Given a totally ramified p-extension of local fields L/K, a Galois Scaffold gives us a Kbasis for K[G] whose effect on the valuation of elements of L is easy to determine.
In 2013, N.P. Byott and G.G. Elder gave sufficient conditions for the existence of Galois scaffolds for cyclic extensions of degree p2 in characteristic p. We take their work and adapt it to cyclic extensions of degree p2 in characteristic 0.
1 Introduction
When studying the Galois module structure for a Galois extension of local fields L/K, a useful tool one has is, as described in [BCE], a K-basis for K[G] (G = Gal(L/K)) whose effect on the valuation of elements of L is easy to determine. This in essence is a Galois scaffold. In [BE13] Byott and Elder gave sufficient conditions for the existence a of Galois scaffold for totally ramified extensions of degree p2 of local fields of characteristic p. Given an extension L/K, which satisfies their assumptions, the lower ramification numbers b1, b2 fall into one residue class modulo p2 represented by 0  b < p2. They conclude that OL is free over its associated order AL/K if and only if b | p2 - 1. Furthermore, if OL is free over AL/K then any element   L with vL() = b satisfies OL = AL/K · . We translate their work into the setting of characteristic 0. Thanks are due to Griff Elder for referring us to the work of Vostokov and Zhukov on Artin-Schrierer-Witt extensions in characteristic 0.

1.1 Local Fields and Ramification

Given a local field K we let vK : K  Z  {} be the normalized valuation on K (this will always mean vK(0) = ). The ring of integers of K is OK = {x  K : vK(x)  0} and the unique maximal ideal of OK is MK = {x  K : vK(x)  1}. We denote by K a uniformizer for K. This is an element that satisfies vK(K) = 1. Hence MK = (K). We let eK = vK(p) where p is the characteristic of the residue field OK/MK of K. We define the Artin-Schrierer map  : K  K by (x) = xp - x and we let Kalg denote an
algebraic closure of K. Let Kn/K0 be a totally ramified Galois extension of degree pn. Let G = Gal(Kn/K0)
and let vn : Kn  Z  {} be the normalized valuation on Kn. For each integer i let Gi = {  G : vn(( - 1)n  i + 1}. Observe that Gi+1  Gi and G0 = G. We say that Gi is the ith group in the (lower) ramification filtration of G. It is known that Gi is a normal subgroup of G for each i and each quotient Gi/Gi+1 is elementary abelian. So we may choose a composition series {1} = Hn  Hn-1  ...  H1  H0 = G that refines the ramification filtration with Hi/Hi+1 = Cp. For each 1  i  n choose i  Hi-1 \ Hi, let Ki = KnHi be the fixed field of Hi. We let vi, Oi, and Mi denote the normalized valuation, ring of integers, and unique maximal ideal for Ki respectively. Additionally ei = eKi and i = Ki for 0  i  n.
Let bi = vn((i - 1)n) - 1. This gives us a non-decreasing list of integers b1  b2  ...  bn which are independent of the choices made. Note that bi is the called the ith (lower) ramification number. Note that bj+1, ..., bn are the lower ramification numbers for Kn/Kj and b1, ..., bj are the lower ramification numbers for Kj/K [BE18, pg. 101].
We define the upper ramification numbers u1 = b1 and

ui

=

ui-1

+

bi

- bi-1 pi-1

for 2  i  n. Note that u1, ..., uj are the upper ramification numbers for Kj/K but uj+1, ..., un are not necessarily the upper ramification numbers for Kn/Kj [BE18, pg. 101]. Suppose E/K is a Galois p-extension and F/K is a Galois subextension. It is well known that if u is an upper ramification number for F/K then u is also an upper ramification number for E/K as well.

1.2 Depth of Ramification
We have the following definition from Hyodo [H]. Let L be a finite extension of K. For finite M/L, and F  {M, L, K} define the depth of ramification (with respect to F ) by

dF (M/L) := inf{vF T rM/L(y) y) : y  M \ {0}}.

It is elementary to see that dF (M/L)  0. Hyodo points out that

dF (M/L) = vF (DM/L) - vF (L) + vF (M )

(1)

2

where DM/L is the different for M/L. So if M/K is a totally ramified Cp2 extension we see that
dM (M/K) = (p - 1)b2 + p(p - 1)b1. It follows from (1) that
dF (M/L) = dF (M/N ) + dF (N/L)
for any intermediate field N.

1.3 Galois Scaffolds for Cp2-extensions
Let K0 be a local field whose residue field has characteristic p. Let K2/K0 be a totally ramified Cp2-extension such that the lower ramification numbers b1 and b2 are relatively prime to p and fall into one residue class modulo p2 represented by 0 < b < p2. Let G = Gal(K2/K0) = Cp2 and let K1/K0 be the unique Cp-subextension. Set Sp2 = {0, 1, ..., p2 - 1} and define a function a : Z  Sp2 by a(j)  jb-2 1 mod p2. For 0  i  1 let a(j)(i) denote the i-th digit in the p-adic expansion of a(j).
Given an integer c  1, two things are required for a Galois scaffold of precision c [BCE, Definition 2.3]: 1. For each t  Z an element t  K2 such that v2(t) = t and s-t 1  K0 whenever s  t mod p2. 2. Elements 1, 2 in the augmentation ideal ( - 1 :   G) of K0[G] such that for each 1  i  2 and t  Z

it 

u  i,t t+p2-ibi 0

mod

 Mc t+p2-ibi 2

if a(t)(2-i)  1

mod

 Mc t+p2-ibi 2

if a(t)(2-i) = 0

where ui,t  K and vK (ui,t) = 0.

2 Witt Vectors in Characteristic 0

2.1 Witt Vectors of length 2
A thorough treatment of the Witt Ring is given in chapter 1 of [FV]. Here we shall state the relevant information.
Let B be a commutative ring with unity. Let

S1(X1, Y1) = X1 + Y1

S2(X1,

X2,

Y1,

Y2)

=

X2

+

Y2

+

X1p

+

Y1p

- (X1 p

+

Y1)p

.

Let the Witt vectors of length 2 over B be the set W2(B) = B × B with addition defined by
(a1, a2)  (b1, b2) = (S1(a1, b1), S2(a1, a2, b1, b2)).

3

Define the Frobenius map F : W (B)  W (B) by F(a1, a2) = (ap1, ap2). The map  = F - id (Witt vector subtraction) is called the Artin-Schrier operator. Let

D(X, Y )

:=

Xp

+Yp

- (X p

+ Y )p

=

-

p-1

p

i
p

Xp-iY i  Z[X, Y ].

i=1

Observe that S2(X1, X2, Y1, Y2) = X2 + Y2 + D(X1, Y1).

2.2 Cyclic extensions of degree p2

From here onward, K0 is assumed to be a local field of characteristic 0 with residue characteristic p. Fix an algebriac closure K0alg of K0. We will use the following to help build our scaffold.

Theorem

2.1

(VZ,

Proposition

3.2).

Let

Also let

a2  K0

Put K2

= K0(x1, x2) for (x1, x2) = (a1, a2)

where  : W2(K0alg)  W2(K0alg) is the Artin-Schrier operator. Then, if x1 / K0, K2/K0

is a cyclic extension of degree p2 and

dK0 (K2/K0)

3 Building The Scaffold
Here we use Witt vectors to construct totally ramified Cp2-extensions which possesses a Galois scaffold.

Set a2 = µpa1. Notice that (2) tells us that

pe0 p-1

>

-v0(a2)

-

1

+

p(p

1)

v0(a1).

(4)

Choose x1, x2  K0alg such that (x1, x2) = (a1, a2). That is to say xp1 - x1 = a1 and xp2 - x2 = a2 + D(x1, a1). Let

K1 = K0(x1) and K2 = K0(x1, x2).

4

Observe that K1 = K0 since a1  K0 \ (K0). Let K2 = K0(x1, x2), it follows from

Theorem

2.1

that

K2/K0

is

a

Cp2 -extension.

Since

-

p p-1

e0

<

v0(a1)

<0

and

p

v0(a1)

it follows from [MW, Theorem 5] that K1/K0 is a totally ramified Cp-extension with

ramification number u1 = b1 = -v0(a1). The goal of this section is to show that K2/K0

has a Galois scaffold.

Set

D1

:=

D(x1, a1)

=

xp1

+ ap1

- (x1 p

+ a1)p

=

-

p-1

p

i
p

xi1ap-i  K1.

i=1

Since

min{-ib1 - p(p - i)b1 : 1  i  p - 1} = -(p2 - p + 1)b1

we deduce that

v1(D1) = -(p2 - p + 1)b1.

Lemma 3.3. Let E/L be a totally ramified Cp × Cp-extension with upper ramification numbers u1 < u2. There is a unique Cp-subextension F/L of E/L with ramification number u1. All other Cp-subextensions of E/L have ramification number u2.

Proof. Let G = Gal(E/L). Consider the upper ramification filtration

 G, if 

x  u1

Gx = Gu2, if u1 < x  u2

 {1}, if u2 < x.

Let H  G such that |H| = p. We see that

(G/H)x = GxH/H =

G/H, if Gx  H {1}, if Gx  H.

If H = Gu2 then Gx  H if and only if Gx  Gu2, which is equivalent to x > u1. In this case u1 is the upper ramification number for EH /L. If H = Gu2 then Gx  H if and only if Gx = {1}, which occurs exactly when x > u2. Thus u2 is the upper ramification number for EH /L. Set F := EGu2 . Then F/L is the unique Cp-subextension of E/L
with ramification number u1.

Proposition 3.4. K2/K0 is a totally ramified extension with lower ramification numbers b1 = -v0(a1) and b2 = p2m + b1. The upper ramification numbers for K2/K0 are u1 = b1
and u2 = -v0(a2) = pm + b1.

Proof. Let z1, z2  K0alg satisfy (z1) = a2 and (z2) = D1. Let N = K0(z1) and

M = K1(z2).

It

follows

from

(4)

that

v0(a2)

>

-

pe0 p-1

.

Since p  v0(a2) it follows

from [MW, Theorem 5] that N/K0 is a totally ramified Cp-extension with ramifica-

tion number -v0(a2).

Likewise

p



v1(D1)

and

-v0(a1)

<

pe0 p2-1

<

. p2e0
(p-1)(p2 -p+1)

Thus

v1(D1)

>

-

pe1 p-1

.

Hence

M/K1

is

a

totally

ramified

Cp-extension

with

ramification

num-

ber -v1(D1). Additionally, M = K0(x1, z2) with (x1, z2) = (a1, 0) so it follows from

Theorem 2.1 that M/K0 is a Cp2-extension. Now the lower ramification numbers for

5

M/K0 are -v0(a1) = b1 and -v1(D1) = (p2 - p + 1)b1. So the upper ramification numbers for M/K0 are -v0(a1) and -v0(a1) + p-1(v0(a1) - v1(D1)) = -pv0(a1).
Now E := MN is a totally ramified Cp2 ×Cp-extension of K0 with upper ramification numbers -v0(a1), -pv0(a1) and -v0(a2). It follows from (3) that -pv0(a1) < -v0(a2) so the upper ramification numbers for E/K0 are ordered by u1 = -v0(a1), u2 = -pvK(a1) and u3 = -v0(a2). Thus the lower ramification numbers for E/K0 are b1 = -v0(a1), b2 = -v1(D1), and b3 = p2m - v0(a1).

Observe that vE(z1) = p2v0(a2) and vE(z2) = pv1(D1). It follows from (2) that (p2 - p + 1)b1 < p2m + b1 which implies that vE(z1 + z2) = p2v0(a2). Now (4) implies

vE

Now g(X)  OE[X], vE(g(0)) > 0 and vE(g(0)) = 0. Thus we may apply Hensel's
lemma and choose   OE such that g() = 0. This means that (z1 +z2 +) = a2 +D1
and so K2  E. Hence K2/K0 is totally ramified.
Now E/K1 is a totally ramified Cp × Cp extension with lower ramification numbers -v1(D1) = (p2 - p + 1)b1 and p2m + b1. Since K2 = M and -v1(D1) is the ramification number for M/K1 it follows from the previous lemma that p2m + b1 is the ramification
number for K2/K1 and thus the second (lower) ramification number for K2/K0. The second upper ramification number is u2 = u1 + p-1(u2 - u1) = pm + b1 = -v0(a2).

Observe that proposition 5 implies that assumption ?? is satisfied. Additionally, it follows from (3) and Proposition 3.4 that

p2b1 < b2.

(5)

We also note that in the proof of Proposition 3.2 we showed that

v2(x2) = min{-(p2 - p + 1)b1, -pb1 - p2m} = -pb1 - p2m = -(p - 1)b1 - b2. (6) Lastly, it follows from Theorem 2.1 and (1) that

dK2(K2/K0) = (p - 1)b2 + p(p - 1)b1 <

p2 + 1 p2 + p

(p2e0).

(7)

The following is presumably well known:

Lemma 3.5. Let F be a local field of characteristic 0. Let   F \ (F ) such that

u = -vF ()

satisfies 0 < u <

p p-1

eF

.

Let 

be

a root of

f (X) = Xp - X - 

and

set

E = F (). If f (X) is irreducible then E/F is a Cp-extension and there is   Gal(E/F )

such

that

Moreover,

if

then

f (X)

and

vF ()

Proof. Since f () = 0 we have

f (X + ) = (X + )p - (X + ) - 

p-1

i=1

p i

p-iX i

with

vF

p i

p-i

= eF - (p - i)p-1u > 0

for 1  i  p - 1. It follows from Hensel's Lemma that f (X) has p roots 0, 1, ..., p-1

in E, with i   + i mod MEpeF -(p-1)u. Hence Gal(E/F ) = Cp. We have 0 =  and

1

=

for

some





E

with

vF ()



eF

(1

-

1 p

)u.

Now assume p does not divide u = -vF (). Let e(E/F ) and f (E/F ) be the ramifi-

cation index and residue degree of E/F respectively. The equations pvE() = vE() =

e(E/F )vF () and p = e(E/F )f (E/F ) imply that e(E/F ) = p. Hence E/F is totally

ramified.

Let   Gal(E/F ) be such that () =  + 1 + . Then for i  1 we have

i() =  + i +  + () + ... + i-1().

In particular, we get

 = p() =  + p + T rE/F ()

and T rE/F () = -p. It follows from the definition of depth of ramification that

vE(p-1)  -dE(E/F ) = -(p - 1)u.

Thus

Proposition

3.6.

Let

C1

= D(x1, 1) =

xp1 +1-(x1 +1)p p

 K1.

There

is

1

 Gal(K2/K0)

such that

(1 - 1)x1 = 1 +  (1 - 1)x2 = C1 + 

where v2() = p2e0 - p(p - 1)b1 and v2() > 0.

Proof. Let X = (X1, X2) and a = (a1, a2). Let x = (x1, x2)  W2(K2). Notice that x is a solution to the equation F(X) = X  a. Replacing X with X  x we get a new equation F(X  x) = X  x  a = X  F(x). So

((X1 + x1)p, (X2 + x2 + D(X1, x1))p) = (X1 + xp1, X2 + xp2 + D(X1, xp1)).

Lemma 3.5 tells us that the first coordinate equation is solved by X1 = 1 +  with vL() = pe0 - (p - 1)b1. Substitute X1 = 1 +  into the second coordinate equation

(X2 + x2 + D(1 + , x1))p = X2 + xp2 + D(1 + , xp1).

(8)

For   K2 with v2() < 0 we have,

so

Now

from

(8) we get the congruence

(X2 + x2 + D(1 + , x1))p  X2 + xp2 + D(1, xp1) mod M2[X2].

(9)

Next we show that

(X2 + x2 + D(1 + , x1))p  (X2 + x2 + D(1, x1))p mod M2[X2].

(10)

8

Set  = x2 + D(1, x1) and  = x2 + D(1 + , x1). Notice that (6) implies that v2(x2) = -(p - 1)b1 - b2 and (5) implies that -(p - 1)b1 - b2 < -p(p - 1)b1 = v2(D(1, x1)) = v2(D(1, x1 + )). Hence v2() = v2(x2) = v2(). So v2(pp-1) = v2(p()p-1) = p2e0 + p(p - 1)v0(a2) > 0 by (4). Thus
(X2 + )p  X2p + p mod M2[X2] (X2 + )p  X2p + ()p mod M2[X2].

Now since v2

p i

xp2-i

> 0 for 1  i  p - 1 and D(1 + , x1)  D(1, x1) mod M2

we see that p  ()p mod M2. Thus (10) is proven. Now (9) can be restated as

(X2 + x2 + D(1, x1))p  X2 + xp2 + D(1, xp1) mod M2[X2].

(11)

It follows from (7) that v2(pxp2-1D(1, x1)) = p2e0 - (p - 1)2b1 - (p - 1)b2 > p2e0 - p(p - 1)b1 - (p - 1)b2 > 0. Thus

(X2 + x2 + D(1, x1))p = (X2 + )p  X2p + p

 X2p + xp2 + (D(1, x1))p

So (11) simplifies to

X2p + (D(1, x1))p  X2 + D(1, xp1) mod M2[X2].

(12)

Suppose p = 2, then

(D(1, x1))p - D(1, xp1) = 2x21  0

mod

M4e0-4b1 2

.

Now assume p is odd. Consider

p-1

Notice that min{p2e0 -p(p-1)2b1 -p(p-2)b1, p2e0 -p2(p-1)b1} > p2e0 -p(p2 -1)b1 > 0. Thus
(D(1, x1))p  D(1, xp1) mod M2[X2].

Hence (12) simplifies to

X2p  X2 mod M2[X2].

Let f (X2) = (X2 + x2 + D(1 + , x1))p - X2 - xp2 + D(1 + , xp1).

Notice that f (X2) = 0 is equivalent to X2 being a solution to (8). It follows from Hensel's lemma that there is   M2 with f () = 0. So (x1 + 1 + , x2 + D(1 + , x1) + ) is a
solution to F(X) = X a. Since D(1+, x1)  D(1, x1) mod M2 and D(1, x1) = C1, we may say x2 +D(1+, x1)+ = x2 +C1 + where v2() > 0. Now (x1 +1+, x2 +C1 +)
is a solution to F(X) = X  a. Hence there is 1  G such that 1x1 = x1 + 1 +  and 1x2 = x2 + C1 + .

Now we have

1(x1, x2)  (x1, x2)  (1, 0) mod W2(M2)

so 1p(x1, x2)  (x1, x2)  p(1, 0)  (x1, x2)  (0, 1) mod W2(M2).

Thus

1px2  x2 + 1 mod M2.

Let 2 = 1p. Since K0(x1) is the fixed field of 2  G we see that (2 - 1)x1 = 0. Also Lemma 3.5 tells us (2 - 1)x2 = 1 +  for some   K2 with v2()  p2e0 + (p - 1)v1(a2).
Given x, y  K0alg we have truncated exponentiation given by

where

=

c  min{b2 - p2b1, p2e0 - (p - 1)b2 - p(p - 1)b1}

with 1 and 2 defined by

p-1
1 + 1 = 12[µ] = 1
i=0

µ i

(2 - 1)i

and 2 = 2 - 1.

10

Proof. We follow the construction given in [BE18].

Let y1 = x1 and y2 = x2 - µx1. We claim that v2(y2) = -b2. Observe that

v2(y2p - xp2 + (µx1)p)  v2(p) - p(pb1 + p2m) = p2e0 - p2b1 - p3m. This means that

(y1)  (x2) - (µx1)

mod

M . p2e0-p2b1-p3m 2

Consider,

(µx1)

=

µpxp1 - µx1

=

µp(x1 +

a1) - µx1 = (µ)x1 + µpa1 = (µ)x1 + a2, so (y1)  D1 - (µ)x1

mod

M . p2e0-p2b1-p3m 2

It

follows

from

(5)

that

v2(D1 - (µ)x1)

=

-pb2.

Since

b1

<

p p-1

e0

,

we

get

-pb1 - p3m

<

p2e0 - p2b1 - p3m. Hence v2(D1 - (µ)x1) < p2e0 - p2b1 - p3m. Thus v2((y1)) =

v2(D1 - (µ)x1).

Hence

v2(y1)

=

1 p

v2(D1

-

(µ)x1)

=

-b2.

Therefore

y1

and

y2

satisfy

choice 2.3 in [BE18].

As per (5) in [BE18], for 1  i  j  2 we choose µi,j  K0 and i,j  Kj-1 such that

(i - 1)yj = µi,j + i,j

with vj(µi,j) = bi - bj < vj(i,j). Observe (1 - 1)y1 = 1 +  so we may set µ1,1 = 1, 1,1 = . Next,
(1 - 1)y2 = (1 - 1)x2 - µ - µ.

Notice that v2(µ) = b1 - b2. In addition, Proposition 3.6 tells us that v2((1 - 1)x2) = v2(C1) = -p(p - 1)b1 and v2(µ) = p2e0 - p(p - 1)b1 + b1 - b2. It follows from (7) that v2(µ) > v2(C1). Also (5) tells us that b2 > (p2 - p + 1)b1 and so b2 - b1 > p(p - 1)b1.
Now we may set µ1,2 = -µ and 1,2 = (1 - 1)x2 - µ. Note that v2(1,2) = -p(p - 1)b1. Finally, (2 - 1)y2 = 1 + . Recall that Lemma 3.5 tells us v2()  p2e0 - p(p - 1)u2.
Set µ2,2 = 1 and 2,2 = .
In order to satisfy assumption 2.9 in [BE18] we must show that

c := 1miijn2{v2(i,j) - v2(µi,j) - pui + p2-jbi} > 0.

We find that

c  min{p2e0 - p(p - 1)b1, b2 - p2b1, p2e0 - (p - 1)b2 - p(p - 1)b1} = min{b2 - p2b1, p2e0 - (p - 1)b2 - p(p - 1)b1}

which is positive by (5) and (7). As per definition 2.7 in [BE18], let 1 = 12[µ] - 1 and 2 = 2 - 1. It follows
from [BE18, Theorem 2.10] that there are {t}tZ which along with 1 and 2 give us
a Galois scaffold of precision c.

Corollary 3.8. For each 0  i, j  p - 1

v2 i1j2 = v2() + jb2 + ipb1 whenever   K2 satisfies v2()  b2 mod p2.

Proof. See Theorem A.1 part (3) in [BCE18].

Much work has been done to study the Galois module structure using the integer c. The reader should refer to Theorem 3.1 in [BCE] to learn more. We will take the route that Byott and Elder did in [BE13] and use Corollary 3.6 to derive results about the Galois module structure. This allows us to reach the conclusions given in [BCE, Theorem 3.1] while relaxing the assumptions about precision. We believe that our theorems could be generalized to allow a2 = µpa1 +  for some   K0 of sufficiently large valuation as in [BE13]. However, we have not carried out the necessary computations.

4 Resulting Galois Module Structure

Let K2/K0 be the Cp2-extension constructed in Section 3 using Choices 3.1 and 3.2, and

let ({t}tZ, {i}i=1,2) be the Galois scaffold from Theorem 3.7. For every non-negative

integer a let

(a) =

  , a(1) a(0) 21

a < p2

0,

otherwise


where a = a(i)pi with 0  a(i)  p-1. Also define a function b from the non-negative
i=0
integers to Z  {} by

b(a) =

(1 + a(1))b2 + a(0)pb1, a < p2

,

otherwise

Note that (a) and b are different from their counterparts in [BCE]. It follows from

Corollary 3.8 that given any   K2 with v2() = b2 we have v2((a)) = b(a). For

0  a < p2, set

da =

b(a) p2

,

so b(a) = dap2 + r(b(a)) where r(b(a)) is the least nonnegative residue modulo p2 of b(a). In addition say da =  when a  p2. For 0  j < p2 let

wj = min{dj+a - da : 0  a < p2 - j}.

Observe that wj  dj - d0 for all j. Let 0  K2 with v2(0) = r(b2). Set  = 0d00, so v2() = b2. Moreover, for a  1
set a = 0-da (a).
Now a = 0 whenever a  p2 and v2(a) = r(b(a)) when 0  a < p2. Thus {v2(a) : 0  a < p2} = {0, 1, ..., p2 - 1}, so {a}0a<p2 is a O0-basis for O2 and the elements (a) span K2 over K0. By comparing dimensions we see that  generates a normal basis for the extension K2/K0, and {(a)}0a<p2 is a K0-basis for the group algebra K0[G].
We aim to estimate valuations of p1 and p2. First we will consider p2. If p = 2 and x  K2× then p2x = (2 - 1)2x = (1 - 22 + 1)x = 2(1 - 2)x and so

12

v2(22x) 2p +

 4e0
p-1 p i=1 i

+ b2 + v2(x). Now assume

(-1)p-i2i - 1 x =

p-1 i=1

p
p
i

= 2 and let (-1)p-i2i x

x  K2×. Consider and so v2(p2x) 

(2 - 1)px = p2e0 + v2(x).

In both cases we may conclude that

v2(p2x)  p2e0 + v2(x)

(13)

for all x  K2×. This of course implies that

v2(p2)  p2e0 + b2.

(14)

Now we turn our attention to p1. Recall that 1 + 1 = 12[µ]. Using the binomial

theorem we find that

p-1
(12[µ])p = p1 +  +
i=1

p i

i1

and so

(p1 + 1)  (12[µ])p

mod

M . p2e0+b2+pb1 2

We would like to get a lower bound for v2(((2[µ])p -1)). Using the multinomial theorem we see that

(2[µ])p =
i0 +i1 +...+ip-1 =p

p

p-1

i0, i1, ..., ip-1 j=0

µ j

ij
(2 - 1)jij

.

0ij p

Notice that for 0  i, j  p - 1, v2

µ j

i(2 - 1)ij

 ij(b1 - b2) + (ij + 1)b2 = b2 + ijb1

and so it follows that

p-1
(2[µ])p 
j=0

µ j

p
(2 - 1)pj

mod

Mp2e0 2

Now (13) tells us

p-1
((2[µ])p - 1) 
j=1

µ j

p
(2 - 1)pj  0

mod

M . p2e0+b2+p(b1-b2) 2

What we've shown is that

p1  (1p - 1)  2

mod

M . p2e0+pb1-(p-1)b2 2

(15)

Notice that p2e0 + pb1 - (p - 1)b2 = p2e0 + b2 - p3m  b2 mod p2. Hence we may apply Corollary 3.8, which implies

p1+rs2  r1s2+1

mod

Mp2 e0 +(r+1)pb1 -(p-1-s)b2 2

whenever 0  r  p - 1 and 0  s  p - 1.

Proposition 4.1. If c  K0 and v0(c)  d0 - dj then

c(j)r  c0dj+r-dr j+r

mod

Mp2 e0 -pb2 -(p2 -p+1)b1 2

(17)

whenever 0  j, r < p2 and j + r < p2. Eqaulity holds in (17) if there is not a carry when adding the p-adic expansions of j and r.

Proof.

First

notice that

(j)r

=

0-dr (j)(r)

and

  dj+r-dr

0

j+r

= 0-dr (j+r). Notice

that (j+r) = (j)(r) if there is not a carry when adding the p-adic expansions of j

and r in which case c(j)r = c0dj+r-dr j+r.

Now assume there is a carry when adding the p-adic expansions of j and r. Let

j = j(0) + pj(1) and r = r(0) + pr(1). We have j(0) + r(0)  p and j(1) + r(1) + 1 < p. Now

(j+r)

=

  . j(0)+r(0)-p j(1)+r(1)+1

It follows from (15) and (16) that

(j)(r)

=

    j(0)+r(0)-p j(1)+r(1) p

2

1

   mod M (j+r)

p2 e0 -(p-1)b2 +pb1 +(j(1) +r(1) )b2 +(j(0) +r(0) -p)pb1 2

Observe that p2e0 - (p - 1)b2 + pb1 + (j(1) + r(1))b2 + (j(0) + r(0) - p)pb1 = p2e0 - (p +

1)b2

- p(p - 1)b1

+ b(j) + b(r).

Now

since

-dr



-

b(r) p2

and

v0(c)

m-

b(j) p2

we see that

c(j)r  c0dj+r-dr j+r

mod

M . p2e0-pb2-(p2-p+1)b1 2

Observe that if

p2e0 - (p + 1)b2 + (p - 1)b1 > 0

(18)

then p2e0 - (p - 1)b2 + pb1 > 2b2 and (15) implies that v2(p1) = 2b2.

Proposition 4.2. Assume (18) is satisfied. It is the case that

0d0-dj (j)r  M2 whenever 0  r, j < p2 and r + j  p2.

Proof. First observe that

0d0-dj (j)r = 0d0-dj -dr (j)(r).

Let r = r(0) + pr(1) and j = j(0) + pj(1) be the p-adic expansions of r and j. Consider two cases. Case 1: Assume r(1) + j(1)  p. It follows from (13) and Corollary 3.8 that

v2 (j)(r)  p2e0 + b2 + (j(1) + r(1) - p)b2 + (j(0) + r(0))pb1 = p2e0 - (p + 1)b2 + b(j) + b(r).

14

Using

d0



, b2-b1 p2

dr



b(r) p2

and

dj



b(j) p2

we

find

that

v2 0d0-dj (j)r  p2e0 - pb2 - b1.

It is clear that if (18) is satisfied then p2e0 - pb2 - b1 > 0. Case 2: Assume r(0) + j(0)  p and r(1) + j(1) + 1 = p. Since v2(p1) = 2b2 we see that
v2 (r)(j)  2b2 + (r(1) + j(1))b2 + (j(0) + r(0) - p)pb1 = b(r) + b(j) - p2b1.

Thus v2 0d0-dj (j)r  p2d0 - p2b1 > 0.

Proposition 4.3. Assume (18) is satisfied. It is the case that
0-wj (j)r  O2
whenever 0  r, j < p2. Proof. First note that Proposition 4.2 implies that 0-wj (j)r  O2 whenever j +r  p2. So we may assume that j + r < p2. First suppose that there is not a carry when adding the p-adic expansions of j and r. Then 0-wj (j)r = 0-wj-dr (j)(r). Note that wj  dj+r - dr so

v2

0-wj-dr (j)(r)

 v2

-dj+r 0

(j

)

(r)

.

Since

there

is

not

a

carry

when

adding

the

p-adic

expansions

of

j

and

r

we

get

-dj+r 0

(j)(r)

=

j+r. Thus

v2 0-wj (j)r  r(j + r)  0.

Now let j = j(0) + pj(1) and r = r(0) + pr(1). Assume that j(0) + r(0)  p and j(1) + r(1) + 1 < p. Now

(j)(r)

=

   . j(0)+r(0)-p j(1)+r(1) p

1

2

1

Since v2(p1)  2b2 we see that

v2 (j)(r)  2b2 + (j(1) + r(1))b2 + (j(0) + r(0) - p)pb1 = b(j + r).

Finally,

since

dj+r

=



b(j+r) p2

,

it

follows

that

v2

0-wj (j)r

 v2

-dr+j 0

(j)

Proposition 4.4. Assume (18) is satisfied. Let 0  j, r < p2. Then

0-wj (j)r



  dj+r-dr-wj

j+r

mod

Mp2 e0 -pb2 -(p2 -p+1)b1 2

(19)

with equality if there is not a carry when adding the p-adic expansions of j and r.

15

Proof. Let j = j(0) + pj(1) and r = r(0) + pr(1) be the p-adic expansions of j and r respectively. Similar to what we saw in Proposition 4.1 we see that that equality holds
in (19) when there is not a carry when adding the p-adic expansions of j and r. Moreover, if j + r < p2 then (19) is implied by Proposition 4.1 since -wj  d0 - dj. So we may assume j + r  p2. This leaves us with two cases.
Case 1: Assume j(1) + r(1)  p. Now j+r = 0. Consider

0-wj (j)r

=

0-dr-wj (j)(r)

=

    . -dr-wj j(0)+r(0) j(1)+r(1)-p p

0

1

2

2

It follows from (14) and Corollary 3.8 that

     0 mod M . j(0)+r(0) j(1)+r(1)-p p

1

2

2

p2e0 -(p-1)b2 +(j(1) +r(1) )b2 +(j(0) +r(0) )pb1 2

Now p2e0 - (p - 1)b2(j(1) + r(1))b2 + (j(0) + r(0))pb1 = p2e0 - (p + 1)b2 + b(j) + b(r). Using

the

bounds

-dr



-

b(r) p2

we

see

that

0-dr-wj (j)(r)  0 0

mod

Mp2 e0 -(p+1)b2 +p2 m 2

mod

M . p2e0-pb2-b1 2

Case 2: Assume j(0) + r(0)  p and j(1) + r(1) = p - 1. Again, j+r = 0. Consider

   =      0 mod M . (j) (r)

j(0)+r(0)-p j(1)+r(1) p

1

2

1

p2e0 -(p-1)b2 -p(p-1)b1 +(j(1) +r(1) )b2 +(j(0) +r(0) )pb1 2

Now p2e0 - (p - 1)b2 - p(p - 1)b1 + (j(1) + r(1))b2 + (j(0) + r(0))pb1 = p2e0 - (p + 1)b2 -

p(p - 1)b1

+ b(j) + b(r)

and

again

-dr



-

b(r) p2

.

Hence

0-dr-wj (j)(r)  0 0

mod

Mp2 e0 -(p+1)b2 -p(p-1)b1 +p2 m 2

mod

M . p2e0-pb2-(p2-p+1)b1 2

Clearly p2eK - pb2 - (p2 - p + 1)b1 < p2e0 - pb2 - b1 and so the claim holds.

Notice that (18) can be restated as e0 > u2 + p-2(b2 - (p2 - 1)b1) = u2 + p-2b1 + p-2(b2 - p2b1). Hence (18) implies that e0  u2 + p-2b1 + 1 since b2 > p2b1. Moreover, since p  b1 we see that (18) implies that e0 > u2 + p-2b1 + 1. Thus (18) implies that

p2e0 - pb2 - (p2 - p + 1) > p2.

(20)

Now we arrive at our main result:

Theorem 4.5. Let K2/K0 be the Cp2-extension constructed in Section 3 using Choices 3.1 and 3.2. Assume further that the lower ramification numbers b1 and b2 satisfy (18). (a) The associated order AK2/K0 of O2 has O0 basis {0-wj (j)}pj=2-01. (b) If wj = dj - d0 for all 0  j  p2 - 1, then O2 is free over AK2/K0; moreover, O2 = AK2/K0 · 0. (c) Conversely, if O2 is free over AK2/K0 then wj = dj - d0 for all 0  j  p2 - 1.

16

Proof. (a) First notice that Proposition 4.3 implies that 0-wj (j)  AK2/K0 since {a}pa2=-01
p2-1
is an O0-basis for O2. Now given an element   K0[G] we may write  = cj(j)
j=0
with cj  K0. Since {a}pa2=-01 is a O0-basis for O2 we find that   AK2/K0 is equivalent
p2-1
to a = cj(j)a  O2 for all 0  a < p2.
j=0
Consider the case a = 0. We have

p2 -1

p2-1

cj (j)0 =

cj 0dj -d0 j .

j=0

j=0

Since this is an element of O2 it follows that v0 cj0dj-d0  0 for each 0  j < p2.
It suffices to show that wj  -v0(cj) whenever 0  j  p2 - 1. To this end observe that if a + j  p2 then Proposition 4.2 implies that cj(j)a  O2 since v0(cj)  d0 - dj. for all 0  j  p2 - 1. Now it follows from Proposition 4.1 and (20) that

a 

cj (j)a 

cj

 dj +a -da 0

j

+a

0j <p2 -a

0j <p2 -a

mod O2.

Since

a

 O2

it

follows

that

c dj+a-da j0

 O0

whenever

a+j

< p2.

This

means

that

dj+a - da  -v0(cj) whenever 0  a < p2 - j and so wj  -v0(cj).

(b) Suppose that wj = dj - d0 for all j. Consider

0-wj (j)0 = 0d0-dj (j)0-d0 (0) = 0-dj (j) = j .

Hence the O0-basis {0-wj (j)}pj=2-01 of AK2/K0 takes 0 to the basis {j}pj=2-01 of O2. Thus

O2 is a free AK2/K0-module. (c) Assume that O2 = AK2/K0 ·  for some   O2. Since {r}pr=2-01 is an O0-basis for O2,
p2-1

we may write  =

xrr with xr  O0. Now {0-wj (j)}pj=2-01 is also an O0-basis for

r=0
O2. It follows from Proposition 4.4 that

p2-1

0-wj (j) =

Hence (20) implies that

17

For 0  i, j  p2 - 1 let

bij =

xj-i0dj -dj-i-wi , i  j

0,

i > j.

Let B := (bij)0i,jp2-1. Let A  Mp2(O0) be the change of coordinates matrix taking the O0-basis {j }pj=2-01 to the O0-basis {0-wj (j)}pj=2-01, say A = (aij )0i,jp2-1. We see that aij  bij mod M0 and so det(A)  det(B) mod M0. Since B is upper-triangular

we see that

p2-1

det(B) = xp02

0dj-d0-wj .

j=0

We also know that v0(det(A)) = 0. Thus

p2-1
0 = v0(det(B)) = p2v0(x0) + dj - d0 - wj.
j=0

Since each term in the sum is non-negative we conclude that wj = dj - d0 for each 0  j  p2 - 1.

As a Corollary to this we get:

Corollary 4.6. Let K2/K0 satisfy the conditions of Theorem 4.5. Let r(b2) be the least non-negative residue of b2 modulo p2. Let AK2/K0 = {  K0[G] : O2  O2} be the associated order of O2. Then O2 is free over AK2/K0 if and only if r(b2) | p2 - 1. Furthermore, if O2 is free over AK2/K0 then O2 = AK2/K0 · 0 for any 0  K2 such that v2(0) = r(b2).
Proof. Follows the proof of Theorem 1.1 in [BE] given on pages 3604-3606.

5 An Example

 Let K0 = Q3( 6 3).

Let K2 = K0(x1, x2) where (x31, x32) = (x1, x2)  (0-1, 0-4). That

is, x31 - x1 = 0-1 and x32 - x2 = 0-4 - 0-2x1 - 0-1x21. Here p = 3, e0 = 6, a1 = 0-1,

a2 = 0-4 and b1 = 1 = m. We verify the following:

18

So K2/K is a totally ramified, cyclic extension of degree p2 which has a Galois scaffold. Here r(b) = 1 | p2 - 1 so Theorem 4.3 tells us that O2 = AK2/K0 · 2. We will verify this.
For 0  a  8 we see that

3,

if

j = 8.

Notice that wj = dj - d0 for 0  j  8. We know that S := {0-wj (j)}0j8 is an O0basis for AK2/K0 . We see that S = {1, 1, 21, 0-12, 0-112, 0-1212, 0-222, 0-2122, 0-32122}.

Now we consider v2 0-wj (j)2

. If it is a full set of residues modulo 9 then
0j8

2 is a free generator for O2 over AK2/K0. Indeed:

v2(0-321222) = 0 v2(0-2222) = 3
v2(0-21222) = 6

v2(12) = 1
v2(12) = 4 v2(212) = 7
