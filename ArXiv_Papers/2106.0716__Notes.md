## Abstract

Nine stellarator configurations, three quasiaxisymmetric, three quasihelically symmetric and three non-quasisymmetric are scaled to ARIES-CS size and analyzed for energetic particle content. The best performing configurations with regard to energetic particle confinement also perform the best on the neoclassical {\Gamma}c metric, which attempts to align contours of the second adiabatic invariant with flux surfaces. Quasisymmetric configurations that simultaneously perform well on {\Gamma}c and quasisymmetry have the best overall confinement, with collisional losses under 3%, approaching the performance of ITER with ferritic inserts.
