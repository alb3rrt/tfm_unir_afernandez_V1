Abstract
We consider interacting massive scalar quantum field theory in the future Rindler wedge. This is a model example of quantum field theory in curved space­time. On this simple example we show how dynamics of correlation functions depends on the choice of initial Cauchy surface, basis of modes and on the choice of initial state build with the use of the corresponding creation and annihilation operators. We show which choice of modes in the future Rindler wedge respects Poincar´e symmetry. But we do not restrict our attention only to these modes and the corresponding state.
1 Introduction
In fundamental quantum field theory one usually considers Poincar´e invariant actions. Furthermore, usually this also implies the consideration of such a Fock space ground state, in which propagators are analytic functions of the geodesic distance between their points. Such propagators are building blocks of the correlation functions which can be used to calculate amplitudes and, then, cross­sections of various scattering processes in the vacuum.
However, in a generic curved space­time there is no Poincar´e symmetry. Furthermore in time­ dependent gravitational backgrounds even the free Hamiltonian is time dependent. Hence, the situation is not stationary and there is no even such a notion as vacuum, which should not be confused with the Fock space ground state. In such a situation one has to apply in­in (aka Schwinger­Keldysh) diagrammatic technique [1], [2]. To define uniquely correlation functions in this technique, one has to specify the initial, in­, state and there is no any fundamental reason to restrict attention only to the Poincar´e invariant states, even if the action is generally covariant [3] or Poincar´e invariant, as it is the case in Minkowski space­time.
In this note we propose to consider in grater details the situation in flat Minkowski space­time, but in curverlinear coordinates. This is just a simple model example for curved space­times. The seminal example of such coordinates are the static Rindler ones (see e.g. [4] or [5]), which cover the right wedge of entire space­time. These coordinates are used to consider the famous Unruh effect [6]. But even in the consideration of this effect one usually restricts attention to the Poincar´e invariant state, which is seen as "thermal" in the accelerating frame.
In this note, instead, we propose to consider quantum field theory in the upper or future wedge of entire Minkowski space­time and to use Rindler coordinates there. In studies of Unruh effect one usually restricts attention to free (gaussian) field theories. In this note we explore

interacting fields. The reason to consider such a situation is that being simple it already contains many features of quantum fields in general time dependent curved backgrounds. Namely to define correlation functions uniquely in the present situation we need to specify an initial Cauchy surface, a basis of modes and then a Fock space state build with the use of the corresponding creation and annihilation operators. We see that for a generic state the dynamics of quantum fields can be drastically different from the one in the Poincar´e invariant state.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we discuss the geometry of "Kasner universe" [7], which is given by the Ridler coordinates in the upper or future wedge. In Sec. 3 the free massive scalar field is quantized in the upper wedge in 2D. In this section we introduce in the upper wedge an analog of the so called de Sitter space­time alpha­states [8], [9]. In Sec. 4 we construct propagators for the alpha­states. In Sec. 5 we calculate the expectation value of the stress­energy tensor of the free theory. In Sec. 6 we briefly discuss the situation in general dimensions. In Sec. 7 we calculate one loop correction for arbitrary generalized alpha state. We use the Schwinger­Keldysh diagrammatic technique. In Sec. 8 we make conclusions. In the Appendix A we present a curious calculation of the In - Out transition amplitude in the free (gaussian) theory.

2 Geometry
In this note we use Rindler coordinates in the upper (future wedge), which are related to the Minkowskian coordinates as:

t = e cosh , y = y, x = e sinh , z = z.

(2.1)

Then the induced metric in the wedge (from the Minkowski space­time) has the following form:

ds24d = e2 d2 - d2 - dy2 - dz2.

(2.2)

These coordinates cover only upper or future wedge of the entire Minkowski space-time t > |x|. Furthermore Cauchy surfaces in this wedge and in the entire Minkowski space­time have different geometry, as is shown on the Fig. 1 by the dashed lines.
To simplify calculations without loss of conceptual issues, in this note we restrict our attention to the two­dimensional (, ) part of the four­dimensional space­time:

ds2 = e2 d2 - d2 .

(2.3)

As we explain in the Sec. 6 our arguments can be straightforwardly generalized to any dimension. Geodesic distance in two dimensional Minkowski space­time in terms of the new coordinates
is as follows:

L = (t2 - t1)2 - (x2 - x1)2 = e22 + e21 - 2e2+1 cosh(2 - 1).

(2.4)

Light-like separation of (2.4) (L = 0) is achieved under the condition that 2 - 1 = |2 - 1|. Below we also use another function of two points, which we will call as the antipodal distance:

LA = (t2 + t1)2 - (x2 + x1)2 = e22 + e21 + 2e2+1 cosh(2 - 1).

(2.5)

The latter is obtained from (2.4) if one of the points is reflected with respect to the origin of Minkowski space-time.

Rindler Wedge

Figure 1: Penrose diagram for Minkowski space-time. The right side of it is the well-known Rindler wedge, while the coloured part is the future or upper wedge. The dashed lines depict Cauchy surfaces. The upper line is such a surface in the future wedge, while the lower dashed line depicts such a surface in the entire Minkowski space­time. Thick red lines correspond to the past horizon the boundary of the upper wedge.

Note that LA > 0 inside the upper wedge, but is zero when both points are sitting on the horizon the light-like boundary of the upper wedge, which is depicted by thick red lines on the fig. 1. Please keep in mind for the future that taking a point in the upper wedge to the horizon corresponds to the limit   -,   ±.
It is worth to mention here that while such a combination of two points as (2.4) respects the entire Poincar´e symmetry of the two­dimensional flat space­time, the combination (2.5) respects only its subgroup, which consists of Lorentz boosts in two­dimensional (, ) space­time. The point is that all functions, which depend on the difference 2 - 1, are invariant under Lorentz boosts. In fact, the Lorentz transformation acts on the coordinates of the upper wedge as follows:

e cosh() e sinh()

cosh  sinh

(3.1)

In this section we restrict our attention to the free theory,  = 0. Interacting theory,  = 0, will be discussed below.
The Klein­Gordon equation for such an action in the background metric (2.3) is:

3

2 - 2 + m2e2 (, ) = 0. By separating the variables one can represent the modes as (, ) = e-ikk(), where:

(3.2)

k() =  Hi(|1k)| me +  Hi(|2k)| me . Then the field operator has the form:

(3.3)



^ =

dk e-ikk() a^(k) + e-ikk() a^(k) ,

-

where the creation and annihilation operators obey the standard commutation relations:

(3.4)

a^(k), a^(k) = (k - k). To satisfy the canonical commutation relations for ^(, ) and its conjugate momentum, ^(, ):

^(, 1), ^(, 2) = i(1 - 2), constants  and  from (3.3) should obey the relation as follows:

(3.5)

||2e|k|

-

||2e-|k|

=

1 8

.

(3.6)

To show this relation one should use the properties of Bessel and Hankel functions, which can be found e.g. in [10].
In the following we will denote as | the Fock space ground states, which are annihilated by a^(k) operators. None of these | states is the ground state of the free Hamiltonian of the theory under consideration since the Hamiltonian depends on time , as we will see in a moment.
Let us consider concrete examples of  and . First interesting case is when  =  =  1 .
4 sinh |k|
We will call these harmonics as In­modes because they behave as single waves when   -. Moreover such modes were introduced in [11] because they behave as positive frequency plane waves near the past horizon. In fact, using the standard relations between Bessel and Hankel functions (see e.g. [10]), one finds that:

ikn() = 4

1 sinh |k|

Hi(|1k)| me

+ Hi(|2k)| me

= Ji|k| me  ei|k|, 2 sinh |k|

as   -. (3.7)

There is also another interesting case of so-called Out­modes, when  =

e-|2k| 22

and  = 0 in (3.3).

These modes behave as single waves in the future infinity. In fact, using asymptotic behaviour of

the Hankel functions [10] we find that:

okut() =

e  -

|k| 2

22

Hi(|1k)|

 eime ,

as   .

(3.8)

To illustrate the reason why we consider generic modes of the type (3.3), let us examine the free Hamiltonian in the theory under consideration. Before normal ordering the free Hamiltonian is

4

+

H0() =

d

e2

T

0 0

,

-

where the energy momentum tensor in the free theory,  = 0, is

Tµ

=

µ 

-

1 2

gµ

g   - m2 2 .

In terms of creation and annihilation operators the free Hamiltonian acquires the form:

(3.9)

where

+

H^0() =

dk Ak() a^(k)a^(k) + Bk() a^(k)a^(-k) + h.c. ,

k

,

Bk ()

=

1 2

k2 + k2 + e2m2 2k

and

k

=

dk d

.

This Hamiltonian cannot be diagonalized once and forever. This means that there is no solution to the Klein­Gordon equation (3.2) that also solves the equation Bp() = 0, unlike the situation in Minkowski coordinates. However one can approximately diagonalize the free Hamiltonian at the past infinity by the In­modes. The point is that in this region of the upper wedge there is a clear meaning of the positive energy and, hence, of the notion of particle.
At the same time there are no modes, which diagonalize even approximately the Hamiltonian (3.10) in the future infinity. However, as we will see below Out­modes lead to the propagator which respects the Poincar´e symmetry. For that reason we consider them in this note.
It is interesting that we have a somewhat similar situation in the expanding Poincar´e patch of de Sitter space­time: There are In­modes, which are usually referred to as Bunch­Davies modes, and which diagonalize the free Hamiltonian at past infinity. At the same time there are no modes, which diagonalize the free Hamiltonian at future infinity [12]. It is probably worth stressing the similarity between the Poincar´e metric in 2D de Sitter space­time and (2.3). Meanwhile, below we will see a certain difference between the situations with In­ and Out­modes in the future Rindler wedge as compared to the expanding Poincar´e patch.
To conclude this section let us derive the canonical (Bogoliubov) transformation between the In­ and Out­modes. Let us denote the set of annihilation operators corresponding to In­modes as a^in(k), and as a^out(k) the set corresponding to Out­modes. The Fock space ground states for these modes are defined as follows:

a^in(k)|In = 0, a^out(k)|Out = 0.

(3.11)

Using properties of the solutions of the Bessel equations, one can find the following Bogoliubov transformation between the a^in(k) and a^out(k) sets:

a^out(k)

=

e

|k| 2

a^in(k)

-

e

-|k| 2

a^in(-k)

.

2 sinh |k|

Then the level population of Out­modes in the In­state is as follows:

(3.12)

In a^out(k)a^out(k) In

=

(k - k) e2|k| - 1

.

(3.13)

But

in

the

situation

under consideration |k| is not an energy. Furthermore there are also non­zero anomalous averages:

In a^out(k)a^out(k) In

=

(k + k) 2 sinh |k|

.

(3.14)

Similarly the expectation values of the level­population and anomalous averages of the In­modes over the Out­states have the following form:

Out a^in(k)a^in(k) Out

=

(k - k) e2|k| - 1

and

Out a^in(k)a^in(k) Out

=

(k + k) 2 sinh |k|

.

Another peculiar solution of the equation (3.6), which we will call as alpha­modes, has the following form:

(3.16)

As we will see below, in certain sense these modes are similar to the seminal alpha­modes in de Sitter space­time [8], [9].
There is the following transformation between the creation and annihilation operators corresponding to (3.16) and those of In­modes:

a^in(k)

=

4

sinh |k| e2|k| - 1

a^(k)

e2|k| - 

- a^(-k) e|k|

 - 

.

(3.17)

We will use this relation below. It is probably worth stressing here that generic alpha­modes (3.3), (3.16) have wrong UV
behaviour. Namely, as we will see below, the corresponding propagators do not obey the conditions of the proper Hadamard behaviour. However, we consider these states for generality and due to their similarity to the alpha­state in de Sitter space­time. At the same time, Out­ and In­modes have proper UV behaviour. And note that In­modes do not belong to the family of alpha­modes.

4 Propagators
In this section we calculate Wightman two­point function for different initial Fock space ground states from the family considered in the previous section. For the Out­state the Wightman function is:

Gout 2, 2 1, 1 = Out ^(2, 2) ^(1, 1) Out = (4.1)

-L - i 0 sgn(2 - 1) .

The very interesting observation, which one can make here is that this propagator does depend only on the geodesic distance (2.4) and can be analytically continued to the entire Minkowski space­time. Furthermore (4.1) coincides with the propagator of the Poincar´e invariant state. This is quite an unexpected result, because Out­modes do not behave as positive frequency modes near the horizon or anywhere else in the future wedge.
In terms of In­modes the two point function (4.1) has the following expansion:

ikn(1) ikn(2) e2|k| - 1

h.c.

.

(4.2)

This expression was found earlier in [11] through a different way of reasoning. To derive this expression we have used the relation between the In­ and Out­modes (3.13) and (3.14). It is such a non­trivial state in terms of In­modes which respects the Poincar´e symmetry. At the same time, it can be shown that the Fock space ground state for In­modes does not respect the Poincar´e symmetry. But we do not have an explicit x­space representation of the Wightman function corresponding to the In Fock space ground state.
The Wightman function of a generic alpha­state, Fock space ground state for the alpha­modes (3.3), (3.16), is as follows:

(4.3)

The first term in this expression coincides with (4.1) up to the coefficient cosh 2 and the  = 0 case exactly reduces to (4.1).
Also the first two terms in (4.3) depend on geodesic distance between the two arguments of the Wightman function, while the other two terms depend on what we call as antipodal distance between the two points (2.5). This structure of the propagator is similar to the one for alpha­states in de Sitter space­time [8], [9]. From (4.3) one can see that the Fock space ground state corresponding to a generic basis of alpha­modes (3.3), (3.16) does not respect the Poincar´e symmetry.
Furthermore, as we will see in a moment, the propagator (4.3) for generic values of  does not possess the proper Hadamard behaviour for the light­like separation of its points. This is also similar to the alpha­states in de Sitter space­time.
Let us now discuss the singularities of the propagator (4.3). All terms in it are proportional to the Macdonald function of zero's order, which is divergent if its argument goes to zero. Geodesic distance L is zero for the light-like separated points inside the future wedge. But geodesic distance LA from the antipodal point of the source in the propagator (4.3) is finite everywhere inside the bulk of the future wedge. At the same time when both arguments of the propagator are sitting on the horizon, i.e. obey |x| = |t|, then simultaneously L and LA are equal zero. Fig. 2 illustrates this fact.
Thus, inside the future wedge only the two terms in the first line of (4.3) have divergences. Note that this means that here we encounter wrong (non Hadamard) UV behaviour of the propagator even inside the future wedge. At the same time all four terms in (4.3) are singular when both points of the Wightman propagator are residing on the horizon. The situation is similar to the one encountered in [13, 14, 15] in the right Rindler wedge, static de Sitter space­time and Schwarzschild black hole for generic thermal states.

5 Stress-energy tensor at the horizon
In this section we show that for the Fock space ground states, corresponding to generic values of  in (3.16), the stress-energy tensor diverges at the horizon. This means that in such states the backreaction of quantum effects on the background geometry is not negligible. Namely, the expectation value of the renormalized stress­energy tensor Tµ strongly affects the Einsteins equations [16] and, correspondingly, their solutions.

But if xµ2 goes to the horizon (boundary of the wedge), then at least one of the blue lines coincides with one of the red lines.
Hence on the horizon we encounter the situation that simultaneously L = 0 and LA = 0.

It is convenient to use In­modes (3.7) for any calculations near the horizon because of their simple behavior in its vicinity. Also to consider a relatively generic situation and to be close to the case described by (3.13) and (3.14), we consider the states of the form:

a^in(k)a^in(k) = |k|(k + k), a^in(k)a^in(k) = n|k|(k - k),

a^in(k)a^in(k) = |k|(k + k), a^in(k)a^in(k) = (n|k| + 1)(k - k).

(5.1)

To regularize the stress-energy tensor we use the point splitting approach [17]. To find the behaviour of the stress energy tensor near the horizon we use the Wightman function, whose form near the horizon follows from the asymptotic behaviour of the Hankel and Bessel functions:

×

ei|k|(1 -2 )

+

n|k| + 1 |(1 + i|k|)|2

e-i|k|(1 -2 )

.

(5.2)

The classical stress­energy tensor of the theory under consideration is given by (3.9). Due to the peculiar behaviour of the components of the metric, as usual, the mass term in this expression is suppressed in the near horizon limit.
One can see that the first two terms under the integral on the RHS of (5.2), which contain |k|, give zero contribution to (3.9) in the near horizon limit. That is because they are proportional

8

to (1 - 2) ± (1 + 2) and die away in the horizon limit. Then only the terms in the second line of (5.2) contribute to the stress energy tensor in the near horizon limit. Thus, in the leading contribution to the stress­energy tensor at the horizon the dependence on |k| is lost. At the same time, subleading terms, which are suppressed by powers of e2, do depend on |k|.
Finally, after the standard regularization, we obtain that (for the technical details one can see e.g. appendix of [14] and [18]):

: T^V V :

O(e2 ),

as   -,

(5.3)

where U =  - , V =  + , and : T^UV : = 0. Note that in (U, V ) coordinates the metric tensor is off-diagonal: ds2 = eU+V dU dV. At the same time eq. (5.3) describes only diagonal terms. Then,
the expectation value of the renormalized stress­energy tensor for generic n|k| is not proportional to the metric tensor and, hence, violates Poincar´e symmetry. Which is just another revelation
of the statement we have made above. Such a violation of the symmetry is similar to the one
appearing in the presence of a gas. General covariance is intact.
Now let us discuss concrete states, i.e. concrete values of n|k| and |k|. E.g. in the case of Out­state (3.13) one has that n|k| = (e2|k| - 1)-1 and obtains:

: T^µ :  0, as   -,

(5.4)

as it should be for the Poincar´e invariant state. At the same time, from (3.17) it follows that generic alpha­state corresponds to:

n|k|

=

16 sinh |k| (e2|k| - 1)2

e2|k|

2 + 2 -  ( + )

=

=

2 sinh |k| (e2|k| - 1)2

e2|k|

e-|k| cosh 2 + e|k| sinh 2 - 2 cosh  sinh  cos  ,

which leads to a divergence in (5.3) even after the normal ordering, if  = 0. Note that to obtain this expression we have subtracted (in normal ordering) the UV divergence with the wrong coefficient. That it because these alpha­states do not have proper Hadamard behaviour.
Meanwhile from (5.3) it follows that in the In­state the regularized stress­energy tensor is equal to

: T^UU :

near the horizon, because for such a state n|k| = 0.

6 The situation in any dimension
In this section we briefly generalize two­dimensional case (2.3) to general D, including the four­ dimensional case (2.2). The harmonic expansion of the two point function (4.1) can be straightforwardly generalized to the D­dimensional case by adding D - 2 spatial flat transversal dimensions. Namely:

where L2 is the geodesic distance in the two dimensional upper wedge (2.4). (To obtain these relations we have used table integrals of the Hankel and Bessel functions.) From the obtained
expression one can immediately see that Out­state for arbitrary D coincides with the Poincar´e
invariant one, because -L2 is given by (2.4). Furthermore, if we will denote (2.5) as LA2 , then one can define the alpha­modes and alpha­
states, for which instead of (4.3) one obtains:

Using these expressions one can straightforwardly generalize to any dimension all the arguments that are presented in the previous sections.

7 One loop correction
In Minkowski space­time for the Poincar´e invariant state a change of the level­population, a+ a , and anomalous average, a+ a+ , is forbidden by the energy­momentum conservation (see e.g. [12]). In fact, if one turns on and then switches off the interactions adiabatically then the true ground state of the free Hamiltonian remains intact. The same should be true for the Poincar´e invariant state in the future wedge. In fact, in x­space the tree­level propagators for the Out­state are the same as in Minkowski space­time.
Furthermore, although in the loops the vertex integrals are over the future wedge rather than over the entire Minkowski space­time, the same argument of analytical continuation as in Poincar´e patch of the anti de Sitter space­time for the invariant state should work (see e.g. [19]). Namely the loop corrected propagator for the Poincar´e invariant state in the future wedge will also be a function of the geodesic distance. That is because the tree­level propagators for the Poincar´e invariant state are analytic functions of the geodesic distance between their points. (See also [20], [12] for the situation with the Bunch­Davies state in the expanding Poincar´e patch of the de Sitter space­time.)
However, there is no energy­conservation in the future wedge, because its metric depends on time. Hence, it is interesting to see in detail what is going on with the level­population and anomalous average for each momentum separately.

10

To make our discussion as general as possible within the context under consideration we will look at the loops for generalized alpha­modes:

k() = k Hi(|1k)| me + k Hi(|2k)| me ,

|k|2 e|k|

- |k|2 e-|k|

=

1 8

.

(7.1)

Compare these modes to (3.3). Here to obey the proper Hadamard behaviour for the correlation functions we demand that k  0 as |k|  . That is important in the loops for the proper UV renormalization. However, for generic k and k we do not know the explicit form of the propagators in x­space, but we know their mode expansion. Note that by choosing a proper behaviour of k and k for low momenta one can avoid the problems in the propagators and expectation values of stress­energy tensors near the horizon. We mean those problems which have been discussed above.
Thus, the main question we address in this section is whether or not the arbitrary alpha Fock space ground state is stable under quantum fluctuations if we switch on the self interaction term in (3.1). As we will see only for the invariant Out­state there will not be any IR secular memory effects [3], [21]. For all other alpha­states there will be the secular growth in the loop corrections for the level­population and anomalous average, which signals the instability of these states. We come back to this point below.
Since the free Hamiltonian of the theory depends on time (3.10), the system under consideration is in a nonstationary state and one has to apply the Schwinger­Keldysh diagrammatic technique [1], [2, 22]. We calculate loop correction to Keldysh propagator, since this propagator describes the change of the state of the theory (see [2, 22], [3], [21] and [12] for the detailed explanation). For generic initial state the mode expansion of the tree­level Keldysh propagator has the following form:





GK (x1, x2) = dk dp k(x1)p(x2)

- -

(p - 2

k)

+

a^k a^p

+ k(x1)p(x2) a^ka^p + h.c. , (7.2)

where x1,2 = (1,2, 1,2). The propagator contains nkp = a^ka^p , which coincides with the level­

population when it is diagonal, i.e. proportional to (p - q); and kp = a^ka^p is the anomalous

quantum average. For the Fock space ground state nkp = 0 = kp.

As the initial state we choose an arbitrary alpha Fock space ground state. Then, in the limit

(7.6)

The 2 dpendence in these expressions appears from the 2,3 integrals. The remaining terms are suppressed since they contain integrals of the form:  d3eime3 , and
do not grow as   . Hence, such terms are just suppressed by powers of the small coupling constant .
Furthermore, if instead of 4 selfinteraction term one will consider 3, the first rather than the second loop correction would have similar form to (7.3), but with the product of different number of  under the integral over 2,3 and q1,2,3. Interestingly enough, in such a situation the integrand of the loop correction will be a rapidly oscillating function and there will be no any secularly growing terms for any generalized alpha­state.
Note that in the case of Out­state we have that k = 0 and the coefficient (7.6) is vanishing. Thus, as was predicted at the beginning of this section, for the initial Out­state loop corrections do not change it, unlike the other generalized alpha­states. That is related to the fact that the Wightman function for such a state is Poincar´e invariant (4.1).
An interesting open question is what happens to all other alpha­states in the course of the time evolution? To answer this question one needs to resum the leading, 2 2 n, corrections from all loops. Because the growth of the leading correction in  is quadratic rather than linear, this is not a kinetic regime. In such a case the resummation is different from the standard one [23]. That is the general situation in lower dimensions. For larger D the situation is kinetic. The result of the resummation and, hence, of the time evolution is an open question. But on general grounds one may predict that for certain range of reasonable initial conditions such alpha­states will probably evolve to the thermal particle density over the Poincar´e invariant state.
Interestingly enough in (7.5) we have secular growth rather than secular divergence. The situation is similar to the one in Poincar´e patch of de Sitter space­time [3]. Namely the dependence on 0 disappears from (7.5). The point is that one can take 0  - in (7.3). In fact, consider the contribution coming from the region 2,3  log p/m, log q1,2,3/m as 0  -. In this regime the modes (7.1) behave as:

k()  C1ei|k| + C2e-i|k|.

(7.7)

Then in the limit in question the expressions in (7.5) contain the integrals of the form (for some p,qi ):

e23 +i3 p,qi 2 + ip,qi

(7.8)

which do not grow as 0  -. The situation here is similar to the one in the expanding Poincar´e patch of de Sitter space­time,
because the metric in the upper wedge (2.3) degenerates as   - similarly to the one of the Poincar´e patch. Due to this degeneration the |g| = e2  factor in the loop integrals suppresses all contributions from the past infinity.
Furthermore, the situation in the past (lower) wedge of Minkowski space­time is similar to the one in contracting Poincar´e patch of de Sitter space­time. Namely, in the theory under consideration all the tree­level two­point functions will be the same as in the future wages, but the loop corrections will grow as 0  - rather than as   +. That is because the lower (past) wedge is the time reversal of the upper (future) wedge. Concretely the loop corrections to the level­population and anomalous averages will have the form:

n1p()  2 02 I

and

1p()



2

02 2

I,

(7.9)

if 0  - and   +. Here I is the same as in (7.6). Thus, in the past wedge we have the infrared catastrophe for generic alpha state. It means that the initial Cauchy surface cannot be
taken to the past infinity [3]. It is only for the state with k = 0 (In­state in the past wedge) that we can take 0  -. Thus, for the Poincar´e invariant state we are again on the safe side.

8 Conclusion
Thus, we see that quantum field dynamics in curverlinear coordinates can be quite different from that in Minkowski coordinates, if one chooses a quite generic, but still reasonable initial state.
To show that we consider Ridler coordinates in the future or upper wedge of Minkowski space­ time. We introduce an analog of the so called alpha­states [8], [9]. We calculate propagators for these states and show that all of them violate the Poincar´e symmetry except the one corresponding to the Out­state. Furthermore, we calculate the expectation value of the stress­energy tensor and show that it is singular on the horizon for all alpha­states except the Out­one. This means that the backreaction of such a state on the background geometry is strong: the expectation value of the stress energy tensor on the RHS of Einstein equations does not lead just to a renormalization of the cosmological constant and cannot be neglected.
Then we introduce generalized alpha­states for which the regularized stress energy tensor can be regular. Unlike the ordinary alpha states the generalized ones lead to the propagators that have proper Hadamard UV behaviour.
Then, using Schwinger­Keldysh diagrammatic technique we calculate loop corrections to the propagators for the generalized alpha­states. We show that for all generalized alpha­states, except the Out­state, loop corrections grow with time signaling the instability of these states. Similar growth was observed in other backgrounds [24], [12], [25], [26] [27], [21], [28], [29], [23].

Appendix
A In-Out amplitudes and imaginary contributions to the effective actions
In this appendix for completeness and integrity we make a curious observation as a side remark. Namely, we present here a calculation of the decay rate of In­state in the future wedge using the
13

in­out formalizm. We have introduced above the so-called In­ and Out­modes (3.7) and (3.8), and Fock space
ground states that correspond to these modes: a^in(k)|In = 0 and a^out(k)|Out = 0. The first state naively describes such a situation in which there are no particles at the past infinity of the future wedge, while the second state seems to describe the situation of the absence of particles at the future infinity.
As we have shown above, the In­state does not coincide with the Poincar´e invariant vacuum. Hence, if the time evolution of the theory starts with this state there in principle can be a particle creation process. In proper sense we have seen this process in the section devoted to the loop calculations within in­in formalism. Here we want to see signs of this phenomenon in the in­out
2
formalism. In fact, as usual the transition probability between these states, In|Out , if it is not equal to unity, may hint that there can particle creation processes in future wedge, at least for the initial In­state in question.
There are two ways to calculate the In/Out­amplitude in question. The first approach is based on the uses of the Bogoliubov coefficients between In­ and Out­modes. This allows to find the imaginary contribution to the effective action:
2
In|Out  e-ImSeff .
The second approach is relaying on the calculation of the imaginary contribution to the effective action using Feynman In - Out propagator at the coincidence limit.
2
Let us start with the first approach. Following e.g. [8, 30], to calculate In|Out one should find the absolute probability of creating no particles with momentum k, which is denoted as Nk, and then integrate it over all possible values of k. Namely:

Nk = e-ImSeff .
k
To find Nk one should use the relation:

Nk 1 + wk + wk2 + .. = 1, then, Nk = 1 - wk,
where wk is the relative probability to produce a pair of Out­particles with the opposite momenta k and -k in the initial In­state:

wk =

Out|aout(k)aout(-k)|In Out|In

2
,

(A.1)

while wk2, wk3, . . . are probabilities of creating 2, 3, . . . and etc. pairs. To calculate wk one should use the Bogoliubov transformation between the In­ and Out­
modes:

ikn = µkokut + ko-ukt. A straightforward calculation of (A.1) with the use of (A.2) gives Nk = |µk|. Then

ImSef f

In the case under consideration the Bogoliubov coefficients are as follows (we have found them in the main body of out text):

Hence, the amplitude is equal to

(A.3)

Interestingly enough, the expression in the exponent is not proportional to the volume of space­ time, which is quite unusual. We will see now that the second method gives a substantially different result for the probability in question.
In fact, following e.g. [31] and [32], we express In - Out effective action via the Feynman (T-ordered) propagator. The relation of the In - Out amplitude to the effective Lagrangian is as follows:

In|Out = ei Leff dx  d[]eiS[]. Now using the chain of equations as follows:

 m2

log

d[]eiS[] = -i

d[](x)(x)eiS[] d[]eiS[]

= -i

dx GF (x, x),

one can express an effective Lagrangian via Feynman propagator at coincident points:

(A.4)

Leff =

dm¯ 2 GF (x, x).



We are interested in the imaginary part of the effective action. Hence, we need to find the imaginary contribution to:

(A.5)

in the coincidence limit. The first term on the RHS of this equation is proportional to (4.1), i.e.
to the invariant propagator. It is known that such a propagator does not lead to any imaginary
contribution at the coincidence limit. Let us denote the second contribution on the RHS of (A.5) as Giimn-out and rewrite it in the
coincidence limit as:

To obtain the effective action we have to integrate this expression over the space­time. To take
the integrals carefully, we cut the upper limit of integration over the time by some large value , which eventually is taken to the future infinity   :

One can see, that (A.6) does not depend on the spatial coordinate . Hence, the integral over 

in (A.4) is divergent. Let us define the spatial volume as V

Then imaginary part

of

(A.6) is equal to:

and we obtain for the probability the following expression:

(A.8)

Note that (A.3) and (A.8) are not equal to each other. Moreover the second expression for the decay rate is proportional to spatial volume, while the first one is finite. These observations essentially question the applicability of the in­out formalism in the situation under consideration. The in­in formalism adopted in the main body of the present note works perfectly well without any ambiguities.
