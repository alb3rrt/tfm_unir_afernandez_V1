## Abstract

We determine the optimal size of such a set of questions for all $n$ (up to sub-exponential factors), answering an open question of Dagan et al. In addition, we generalize the results of Dagan et al. to the $d$-ary setting, obtaining similar results with $1.25$ replaced by $1 + (d-1)/d^{d/(d-1)}$.
