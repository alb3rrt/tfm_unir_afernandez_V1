## Abstract

We first consider a $d$-dimensional branching Brownian motion (BBM) evolving in an expanding ball, where the particles are killed at the boundary of the ball, and the expansion is subdiffusive in time. We study the large-time asymptotic behavior of the mass inside the ball, and obtain a large-deviation (LD) result as time tends to infinity on the probability that the mass is aytpically small. Then, we consider the problem of BBM among mild Poissonian obstacles, where a random `trap field' in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is created via a Poisson point process. The trap field consists of balls of fixed radius centered at the atoms of the Poisson point process. The mild obstacle rule is that when a particle is inside a trap, it branches at a lower rate, which is allowed to be zero, whereas when outside the trap field it branches at the normal rate. As an application of our LD result on the mass of BBM inside expanding balls, we prove upper bounds on the LD probabilities for the mass of BBM among mild obstacles, which we then use along with the Borel-Cantelli lemma to prove the corresponding strong law of large numbers. Our results are quenched, that is, they hold in almost every environment with respect to the Poisson point process.
