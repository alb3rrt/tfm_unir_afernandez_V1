Finite quotients of surface braid groups and double Kodaira fibrations
Francesco Polizzi and Pietro Sabatino
To Professor Ciro Ciliberto on the occasion of his 70th birthday
Abstract Let  be a closed Riemann surface of genus . We give an account of some results obtained in the recent papers [CaPol19, Pol20, PolSab21] and concerning what we call here pure braid quotients, namely non-abelian finite groups appearing as quotients of the pure braid group on two strands P2 (). We also explain how these groups can be used in order to provide new constructions of double Kodaira fibrations.
0 Introduction
A Kodaira fibration is a smooth, connected holomorphic fibration 1 :  - 1, where  is a compact complex surface and 1 is a compact complex curve, which is not isotrivial (this means that not all its fibres are biholomorphic to each others). The genus 1 := (1) is called the base genus of the fibration, whereas the genus  := (), where  is any fibre, is called the fibre genus. If a surface  is the total space of a Kodaira fibration, we will call it a Kodaira fibred surface. For every Kodaira fibration we have 1  2 and   3, see [Kas68, Theorem 1.1]. Since the fibration is smooth, the condition on the base genus implies that  contains no rational or elliptic curves; hence it is minimal and, by the sub-additivity of the Kodaira dimension, it is of general type, hence algebraic.

Examples of Kodaira fibrations were originally constructed in [Kod67, At69] in order to show that, unlike the topological Euler characteristic, the signature  of a real manifold is not multiplicative for fibre bundles. In fact, every Kodaira fibred surface  satisfies () > 0, see for example the introduction of [LLR20], whereas (1) = () = 0, and so ()  (1)().
A double Kodaira surface is a compact complex surface , endowed with a double Kodaira fibration, namely a surjective, holomorphic map  :  - 1 О 2 yielding, by composition with the natural projections, two Kodaira fibrations  :  - ,  = 1, 2.
The purpose of this article is to give an account of recent results, obtained in the series of papers [CaPol19, Pol20, PolSab21], concerning the construction of some double Kodaira fibrations (that we call diagonal) by means of group-theoretical methods. Let us start by introducing the needed terminology. Let   2 and   2 be two positive integers, and let P2 () be the pure braid group on two strands on a closed Riemann surface of genus . We say that a finite group  is a pure braid quotient of type (, ) if there exists a group epimorphism

 : P2 () - 

(1)

such that ( 12) has order , where 12 is the braid corresponding, via the isomorphism P2 () 1 ( О  - ), to the homotopy class in  О  -  of a loop in  О  "winding once" around the diagonal . Since 12 is a commutator in P2 () and   2, it follows that every pure braid quotient is a non-abelian group, see Remark 2.
By Grauert-Remmert's extension theorem together with Serre's GAGA, the existence of a pure braid quotient as in (1) is equivalent to the existence of a Galois cover f :  -  О , branched over  with branching order . After Stein factorization, this yields in turn a diagonal double Kodaira fibration  :  - 1 О 2 . We have f =  , i.e. no Stein factorization is needed, if and only if  is a strong pure braid quotient, an additional condition explained in Definition 3.
We are now in a position to state our first results, see Theorems 1, 2, 3:
и If   2 is an integer and   5 is a prime number, then both extra-special -groups of order 4+1 are non-strong pure braid quotients of type (, ).
и If   2 is an integer and  is a prime number dividing  + 1, then both extraspecial -groups of order 2+1 are pure braid quotients of type (, ).
и If a finite group  is a pure braid quotient, then | |  32, with equality holding if and only if  is extra-special. Moreover, in the last case, we can explicitly compute the number of distinct quotients maps of type (1), up to the natural action of Aut().
We believe that such results are significant because, although we know that P2 () is residually -finite for all   2 (see [BarBel09, pp. 1481-1490]), it is usually tricky to explicitly describe its non-abelian finite quotients.
The geometrical counterparts of the above group-theoretical statements allow us to construct infinite families of double Kodaira fibrations with interesting numerical

properties, for instance having slope greater than 2 + 1/3 or signature equal to 16, see Theorems 4, 5, 6:
и Let  :   -  О  be the diagonal double Kodaira fibration associated with a non-strong pure braid quotient  : P2 (2) -  of type (2, ), where  is an extra-special -group  of order 9 and  = 4 + 1. Then the maximum slope ( ) is attained for precisely two values of , namely

Furthermore, ( ) > 2 + 1/3 for all   5. More precisely, if   7 the function ( ) is strictly decreasing and

и Let  be any closed Riemann surface of genus . Then there exists a double Kodaira fibration  :  -  О . Moreover, denoting by () the number of such fibrations, we have ()  ( + 1),

where  : N - N stands for the arithmetic function counting the number of distinct prime factors of a positive integer. In particular,

lim sup () = +.

и Let  be a finite group and f :  -  О  be a Galois cover, with Galois group , branched over the diagonal  with branching order . Then | |  32, and equality holds if and only if  is extra-special. If  is extra-special of order 32 and (, ) = (2, 2), then f :  - 2 О 2 is a diagonal double Kodaira fibration such that 1 = 2 = 2, 1 = 2 = 41, () = 16.
As a consequence of the last result, we obtain a sharp lower bound for the signature of a diagonal double Kodaira fibration, see Theorem 7:
и Let  :  - 1 О 2 be a diagonal double Kodaira fibration, associated with a pure braid quotient  : P2 () -  of type (, ). Then ()  16, and equality holds precisely when (, ) = (2, 2) and  is an extra-special group of order 32.
Note that our methods show that every curve of genus  (and not only some special curve with extra automorphisms) is the basis of a (double) Kodaira fibration and that, in addition, the number of distinct Kodaira fibrations over a fixed base can be arbitrarily large. Furthermore, every curve of genus 2 is the base of a (double) Kodaira fibration with signature 16 and this provides, to our knowledge, the first example of positive-dimensional family of (double) Kodaira fibrations with small signature.

The aforementioned examples with signature 16 also provide new "double solutions" to a problem, posed by G. Mess and included in Kirby's problem list in low-dimensional topology, see [Kir97, Problem 2.18 A], asking what is the smallest number  for which there exists a real surface bundle over a real surface with base genus  and non-zero signature. We actually have  = 2, also for double Kodaira fibrations, see Theorem 8:
и Let  be double Kodaira surface, associated with a pure braid quotient  : P2 () -  of type (2, 2), where  is an extra-special group of order 32. Then the real manifold  underlying  is a closed, orientable 4-manifold of signature 16 that can be realized as a real surface bundle over a real surface of genus 2, with fibre genus 41, in two different ways.
In fact, it is an interesting question whether 16 and 41 are the minimum possible values for the signature and the fibre genus of a (not necessarily diagonal) double Kodaira surface  :  - 2 О 2, but we will not develop this point here.
The above results paint a rather clear picture regarding pure braid quotients and the relative diagonal double Kodaira fibrations when | |  32. It is natural then to investigate further this topic for | | > 32, and indeed this paper also contains the following new result, see Theorem 9:
и If  is a finite group with 32 < | | < 64, then  is not a pure braid quotient.
We provide only a sketch of the proof, which is based on calculations performed by means of the computer algebra system GAP4, see [GAP4]; the details will appear in a forthcoming paper.

Notation and conventions. The order of a finite group  is denoted by | |. If   , the order of  is denoted by (). The subgroup generated by 1, . . . ,    is denoted by 1, . . . ,  . The center of  is denoted by  () and the centralizer of an element    by  (). If ,   , their commutator is defined as [, ] = -1-1. We denote both the cyclic group of order  and the field with  elements by Z. We use sometimes the IdSmallGroup(G) label from GAP4 list of small groups. For instance, S4 =  (24, 12) means that S4 is the twelfth group of order 24 in this list.

1 Pure surface braid groups and finite braid quotients
Let  be a closed Riemann surface of genus   2, and let  = ( 1, 2) be an ordered pair of distinct points on . A pure geometric braid on  based at  is a pair (1, 2) of paths  : [0, 1] -  such that и  (0) =  (1) =  for all   {1, 2} и the points 1 (), 2 ()   are pairwise distinct for all   [0, 1],

Definition 1 The pure braid group on two strands on  is the group P2 () whose elements are the pure braids based at  and whose operation is the usual concatenation of paths, up to homotopies among braids.

It can be shown that P2 () does not depend on the choice of the set  = ( 1, 2), and that there is an isomorphism

P2 () 1 ( О  - , )

(2)

where    О  is the diagonal. The group P2 () is finitely presented for all , and explicit presentations can
be found in [Bel04, Bir69, GG04, S70]. Here we follow the approach in [GG04, Sections 1-3], referring the reader to that paper for further details.

Proposition 1 ([GG04, Theorem 1]) Let 1, 2  , with   2. Then the map of pointed topological spaces given by the projection onto the first component

( О  - , ) - (, 1)

induces a split short exact sequence of groups

1 - 1 ( - { 1}, 2) - P2 () - 1 (, 1) - 1.

(3)

For all   {1, . . . , }, let us consider now the 2 elements

1  , 1  , 2  , 2 

(4)

of P2 () represented by the pure braids shown in Figure 2.

If   , the path corresponding to   and   based at  is the constant path. Moreover, let 12 be the pure braid shown in Figure 3. In terms of the isomorphism (2), the generators   ,   correspond to the generators of 1 ( О  - , ) coming from the usual description of  as the identification space of a regular 2gon, whereas 12 corresponds to the homotopy class in  О  -  of a topological loop in  О  that "winds once" around .

The elements

21, . . . , 2, 21, . . . , 2, 12

(5)

can be seen as generators of the kernel 1 ( -{1}, 2) in (3), whereas the elements

11, . . . , 1, 11, . . . , 1

(6)

are lifts of a set of generators of 1 (, 1) via the quotient map P2 () - 1 (, 1), namely, they form a complete system of coset representatives for 1(, 1).
By Proposition 1, the braid group P2 () is a semi-direct product of the two groups 1 ( -{ 1}, 2) and 1 (, 1), whose presentations are both well-known; then, in order to write down a presentation for P2 (), it only remains to specify how the generators in (6) act by conjugation on those in (5). This is provided by
the following result, cf. [CaPol19, Theorem 1.6], where the conjugacy relations are expressed in the commutator form (i.e., instead of -1 =  we write [, ] = -1).

Proposition 2 ([GG04, Theorem 7]) The group P2 () admits the following presentation.

Generators 1  , 1  , 2  , 2  , 12  = 1, . . . , .

Remark 1 The inclusion map  :  О  -  -  О  induces a group epimorphism  : P2 () - 1 ( О , ), whose kernel is the normal closure of the subgroup generated by 12. Thus, given any group homomorphism  : P2 () - , it factors through 1 ( О , ) if and only if ( 12) is trivial.
Tedious but straightforward calculations show that the presentation given in Proposition 2 is invariant under the substitutions
12  1-21, 1   2-1+1-  , 1   2 +1-  ,
where   {1, . . . , }. These substitutions correspond to the involution of P2 () induced by a reflection of  switching the -th handle with the ( + 1 - )-th handle

for all . Hence we can exchange the roles of 1 and 2 in (3), and see P2 () as the middle term of a split short exact sequence of the form

1 - 1 ( - { 2}, 1) - P2 () - 1 (, 2) - 1,

(8)

induced by the projection onto the second component

( О  - , ) - (, 2).
Now the elements 11, . . . , 1, 11, . . . , 1, 12
can be seen as generators of the kernel 1 ( -{2}, 1) in (8), whereas the elements

21, . . . , 2, 21, . . . , 2
yield a complete system of coset representatives for 1 (, 2). We can now define the objects studied in this paper.
Definition 2 Take positive integers ,   2. A finite group  is called a pure braid quotient of type (, ) if there exists a group epimomorphism

 : P2 () - 

(9)

such that ( 12) has order .

Remark 2 Since we are assuming   2, the element ( 12) is non-trivial and so the epimorphism  does not factor through 1 ( О , ), see Remark 1. The geometrical relevance of this condition will be explained in Section 3. The same
condition also shows that a pure braid quotient is necessarily non-abelian, because ( 12) is a non-trivial commutator in , see (7).

Sometimes, by abuse of terminology, we will use the term pure braid quotient in order to indicate the full datum of the quotient homomorphism (9), instead of the quotient group  alone.
If  is a pure braid quotient, then the two subgroups

1 := (11), (11), . . . , (1), (1), ( 12)

(10)

2 := (21), (21), . . . , (2), (2), ( 12)

are both normal in , and hence there are two short exact sequences

1 - 1 -  - 2 - 1 1 - 2 -  - 1 - 1,
in which the elements (21), (21), . . . , (2), (2) yield a complete system of coset representatives for 2, whereas the elements (11), (11), . . . , (1), (1) yield a complete system of coset representatives for 1.

Let us end this section with the following definition, whose geometrical meaning will become clear later, see Remark 5 of Section 3.

Definition 3 A pure braid quotient  : P2 () -  is called strong if 1 = 2 = .

2 Extra-special groups as pure braid quotients

We know that P2 () is residually -finite for all prime number   2, see [BarBel09, pp. 1481-1490]. This implies that, for every , we can find a non-abelian finite -group  that is a pure braid quotient of type (, ), where  is a power of . However, it can be tricky to explicitly describe some of these quotients.
In this section we will present a number of results in this direction, obtained in the series of articles [CaPol19, Pol20, PolSab21]; our exposition here will closely follow the treatment given in these papers. Let us start by introducing the following classical definition, see for instance [Gor07, p. 183] and [Is08, p. 123].

Definition 4 Let  be a prime number. A finite -group  is called extra-special if its center  () is cyclic of order  and the quotient  = / () is a non-trivial, elementary abelian -group.

An elementary abelian -group is a finite-dimensional vector space over the field Z, hence it is of the form  = (Z)dim  and  fits into a short exact sequence

1 - Z -  -  - 1.

(11)

Note that,  being abelian, we must have [, ] = Z, namely the commutator subgroup of  coincides with its center. Furthermore, since the extension (11) is
central, it cannot be split, otherwise  would be isomorphic to the direct product of
the two abelian groups Z and , which is impossible because  is non-abelian. It can be also proved that, if  is extra-special, then dim  is even and so | | = dim  +1
is an odd power of . For every prime number , there are precisely two isomorphism classes  ( ),
 ( ) of non-abelian groups of order 3, namely

 ( ) = r, t, z | r = t = 1, z = 1, [r, z] = [t, z] = 1, [r, t] = z-1  ( ) = r, t, z | r = t = z, z = 1, [r, z] = [t, z] = 1, [r, t] = z-1

and both of them are in fact extra-special, see [Gor07, Theorem 5.1 of Chapter 5]. If  is odd, then the groups  ( ) and  ( ) are distinguished by their exponent,
which equals  and 2, respectively. If  = 2, the group  ( ) is isomorphic to the dihedral group 8, whereas  ( ) is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8.
We can now provide the classification of extra-special -groups, see [Gor07,
Section 5 of Chapter 5].

Proposition 3 If   2 is a positive integer and  is a prime number, there are exactly two isomorphism classes of extra-special -groups of order 2+1, that can be described as follows.

[r  , t ] = z- .

If  is odd, this group has exponent 2. We are now in a position to state our first two results.

Theorem 1 ([CaPol19, Section 3], [Pol20, Theorem 2.10]) If   2 is an integer and   5 is a prime number, then both extra-special -groups of order 4+1 are pure braid quotients of type (, ). All these quotients are non-strong, in fact 1 and 2 have index 2 in .
Theorem 2 ([CaPol19, Section 3], [Pol20, Theorem 2.7]) If   2 is an integer and  is a prime number dividing  + 1, then both extra-special -groups of order 2+1 are strong pure braid quotients of type (, ).

Theorems 1 and 2 were originally proved by the first author and A. Causin in [CaPol19], but only in the case  = H4+1 (Z) and  = H2+1 (Z), respectively, by using some group-cohomological results related to the structure of the cohomology algebra  ( О  - , Z). Let us give here a sketch of the argument, referring
the reader to the aforementioned paper for full details. Assuming   3, we identified H4+1 (Z) with the symplectic Heisenberg group
Heis(, ), where

 = 1 ( О  - , Z) 1 ( О , Z) (Z)4

and  is a symplectic form on . This group is the central extension

Finite quotients of surface braid groups and double Kodaira fibrations

11

1 - Z - Heis(, ) -  - 1

(12)

of the additive group  given as follows: the underlying set of Heis(, ) is  О Z, endowed with the group law

1

(1, 1) (2, 2) = 1 + 2, 1 + 2 + 2(1, 2) .

(13)

By basic linear algebra, all symplectic forms on (Z)4 are equivalent to the standard symplectic form; thus, given two symplectic forms 1, 2 on , the two Heisenberg groups Heis(, 1), Heis(, 2) are isomorphic. Moreover, the center of the Heisenberg group coincides with its commutator subgroup and is isomorphic to Z.
Now, let  : P2 () - 
be the group epimorphism given by the composition of the reduction mod  map 1 ( О  - , Z) -  with the abelianization map P2 () - 1 ( О  - , Z). We have a commutative diagram

P2 ()

/ Z

/ Heis(, )

/1

and we denote by   2 (, Z) the cohomology class corresponding to the bottom Heisenberg extension. Then a lifting  : P2 () - Heis(, ) of  exists if and only if  = 0  2 (P2 (), Z).
The next step is to provide an interpretation of the cohomological condition  = 0 in terms of the symplectic form , and this is achieved by using the following facts:
и we have a natural identification

2 (, Z)

2 ( )






(14)

under which the extension class  giving the Heisenberg central extension (12) corresponds to (, ). Here  :  - Z stands for the linear functional on  defined by  () =  , where  is any preimage of  in Heis(, ); и we have natural identifications

Alt2 ( ) 2   / 2 ( О  - , Z),

where the isomorphism on the left is (14), the vertical map on the left is the projection onto the first summand and the vertical map on the right is (15). Since the projection of the extension class   2 (, Z) can be naturally identified with   Alt2 (), we have proved the following
Proposition 4 The obstruction class   2 (P2 (), Z) can be naturally interpreted as the image ()  2 ( О -, Z) of the symplectic form   Alt2 () via the cup-product map .
As a consequence, we obtain the following lifting criterion, that we believe is of independent interest.
Proposition 5 A lifting  : P2 () - Heis(, ) of  : P2 () -  exists if and only if () = 0. Furthermore, if  exists, then ( 12) has order  if and only if  ()  2 ( О , Z) is a non-zero integer multiple of the diagonal class . In this case,  is necessarily surjective.
Inspired by Proposition 5, we say that a symplectic form   Alt2 () is of Heisenberg type if  () is a non-zero integer multiple of ; equivalently,  is of Heisenberg type if () = 0 and  ()  0. By the previous discussion it follows that, if  is of Heisenberg type, Heis(, ) is a pure braid quotient of type (, ).
We are therefore left with the task of constructing symplectic forms of Heisenberg type on . We denote by 1, 1, . . . , ,  the images in 1 (, Z) =

1 (, Z)  Z of the elements of a basis of 1 (, Z) which is symplectic with respect to the cup product; then, we can choose for  the ordered basis

11, 11, . . . , 1, 1, 21, 21, . . . , 2, 2

(16)

where, under the isomorphism  1 ( О , Z) induced by the inclusion  :  О  -  -  О , the elements 1  , 1  , 2  , 2    are the duals of the elements    1,    1, 1    , 1     1 ( О , Z) 1 (, Z)  1 (, Z), respectively.
Since   5, we can find non-zero scalars 1, . . . , , 1, . . . ,   Z such that 1 -  1  0 for all   {1, . . . , } and

Standard Gaussian elimination shows that

det  = (1 - 1 1)2 (1 - 2 2)2 и и и (1 -  )2 > 0

and so  is non-degenerate. Moreover, a direct computation yields  () = , that is,  is of Heisenberg type. The calculation of the indices of 1 and 2 in  is now straightforward, and this completes the proof of Theorem 1 in the case  = H4+1 (Z).
Now, let us assume that  divides  + 1, so that - = 1 holds in Z, and take

1 = . . . =  = 1 = . . . =  = -1  Z.

Therefore relations (17) are satisfied and the same computations as in the previous case show that the corresponding alternating form  satisfies  () = . However,  is not symplectic, since its associate matrix

 =    Mat(4, Z)  

has rank 2 and, subsequently,  has a 2-dimensional kernel 0, namely

0 = 11 - 21, 11 - 21, . . . , 1 - 2, 1 - 2 .

(19)

The set  О Z, with the operation (13), is a group whose center equals 0 О Z and that, with slight abuse of notation, we denote again by Heis(, ). Furthermore,
the argument in Proposition 5 still applies, providing the existence of a lifting P2 () - Heis(, ). Setting  = /0, the alternating form on  descends to a symplectic form on , that we denote it again by ; so Heis(, ) is a genuine Heisenberg group, endowed with a group epimorphism Heis(, ) - Heis(, ). Composing this epimorphism with the lifting P2 () - Heis(, ), we obtain a group epimorphism  : P2 () - Heis(, ) such that ( 12) is non-trivial and central, hence of order .
Since  is a Z-vector space of dimension 2, the group Heis(, ) is isomorphic to H2+1 (Z); finally, a simple computation based on the expression (19) for ker  yields 1 = 2 = , and this shows Theorem 2 in the case  = H2+1 (Z).
The proof of Theorems 1 and 2 in full generality (i.e, for all extra-special groups)
was given in [Pol20], using a completely algebraic technique that avoided the use of
symplectic geometry and of group cohomology. It is based on the following

Definition 5 Let  be a finite group. A diagonal double Kodaira structure of type (, ) on  is an ordered set of 4 + 1 generators

 = (r11, t11, . . . , r1, t1, r21, t21, . . . , r2, t2, z), with (z) = , that are images of the ordered set of generators

( 11, 11, . . . , 1, 1, 21, 21, . . . , 2, 2, 12)

via a pure braid quotient  : P2 () -  of type (, ). The structure is called strong if
r11, t11, . . . , r1, t1 = r21, t21, . . . , r2, t2 = .
Therefore, checking whether  is a pure braid quotient of type (, ) is equivalent to checking whether it admits a diagonal double Kodaira structure  of type (, ). Moreover, by definition,  : P2 () -  is strong if and only if  is.
Let us refer now to the presentations for extra-special -groups given in Proposition 3. Assuming that  divides  + 1, in both cases  = H2+1 (Z) and

 = G2+1 (Z) we can obtain a strong diagonal double Kodaira structure  on  by setting
r1  = r2  = r  , t1  = t2  = t 
for all  = 1, . . . , . The divisibility condition is necessary to ensure that the element of  satisfy the two relations coming from the surface relations in (4). This proves Theorem 2.
In order to prove Theorem 1, it is convenient to consider the following alternative presentation of extra-special -groups. Consider any non-degenerate, skewsymmetrix matrix  = (  ) of order 2 over Z, and consider the finitely presented groups

H( ) = x1, . . . , x2, z | x1 = . . . = x2 = z = 1,

[x1, z] = . . . = [x2, z] = 1,

(20)

[x, x] = z ,

G( ) = x1, . . . , x2, z | x1 = . . . = x2-2 = z = 1,

x2-1 = x2 = z,

(21)

[x1, z] = . . . = [x2, z] = 1,

[x, x] = z ,

where the exponent in z stands for any representative in Z of    Z. Standard computations show that H( ) H2+1 (Z) and G( ) G2+1 (Z). Now we can take as  the matrix   Mat(4, Z) given in (18). Setting  = H() or  = G(), the group  is generated by a set of 4 + 1 elements

 = {r11, t11, . . . , r1, t1, r21, t21, . . . , r2, t2, z}

subject to the relations (20) or (21), respectively. One can check that  provides a diagonal double Kodaira structure of type (, ) on , and so a diagonal double Kodaira structure of the same type on the isomorphic group H4+1 (Z) or G4+1 (Z). This proves Theorem 1.
Remark 3 In particular, the pure braid quotients of smallest order detected by the methods detailed so far are the extra-special groups of order 27 = 128, corresponding to the case (, ) = (3, 2) in Theorem 2.
Recently, in the paper [PolSab21], we were able to significantly lower the value of | |, actually providing a sharp lower bound for the order of a pure braid quotient.
Theorem 3 ([PolSab21, Theorem A]) Assume that  is a finite group that is a pure braid quotient. Then | |  32, with equality if and only if  is extra-special. In this case, the following holds.
и There are precisely 2211840 = 1152 и 1920 distinct group epimorphisms  : P2 (2) - , and all of them make  a strong pure braid quotient of type (2, 2).

и if  =  (32, 49) = H5 (Z2), these epimorhisms form 1920 orbits under the natural action of Aut().
и if  =  (32, 50) = G5 (Z2), these epimorhisms form 1152 orbits under the natural action of Aut().

The proof of Theorem 3 is obtained again by looking at the diagonal double Kodaira structures on , see Definition 5.

Remark 4 A key observation is that if  is a CCT-group, namely  is not abelian and commutativity is a transitive relation on the set of the non-central elements, then  admits no diagonal double Kodaira structures and, subsequently, it cannot be a pure braid quotient.

A long but straightforward analysis shows that there are precisely eight nonCCT groups with   32, namely  = S4 and  =  (32, ) with   {6, 7, 8, 43, 44, 49, 50}.
These case are handled separately, and a refined analysis proves that only  (32, 49) and  (32, 50), i.e. the two extra-special groups, admit diagonal double Kodaira structures.
Finally, the number of such structures in each case is computed by using the same techniques as in [Win72]; more precisely, we exploit the fact that  = / () can be endowed with a natural structure of 4-dimensional symplectic vector space over Z2, and that Out() embeds in Sp(4, Z2) as the orthogonal group associated with the quadratic form  on  related to the symplectic form (и , и) by (x y) = (x) + (y) + (x, y).

3 Geometrical application: diagonal double Kodaira fibrations
Recall that a Kodaira fibration is a smooth, connected holomorphic fibration 1 :  - 1, where  is a compact complex surface and 1 is a compact complex curve, which is not isotrivial (this means that not all fibres are biholomorphic each other). The genus 1 := (1) is called the base genus of the fibration, whereas the genus  := (), where  is any fibre, is called the fibre genus.
Definition 6 A double Kodaira surface is a compact complex surface , endowed with a double Kodaira fibration, namely a surjective, holomorphic map  :  - 1 О 2 yielding, by composition with the natural projections, two Kodaira fibrations  :  - ,  = 1, 2.
With a slight abuse of notation, in the sequel we will use the symbol  to indicate both a closed Riemann surface of genus  and its underlying real surface. If a finite group  is a pure braid quotient of type (, ) then, by using GrauertRemmert's extension theorem together with Serre's GAGA, the group epimorphism  : P2 () -  yields the existence of a smooth, complex, projective surface  endowed with a Galois cover

f :  -  О 

with Galois group  and branched precisely over  with branching order , see [CaPol19, Proposition 3.4]. Composing the group monomorphisms 1 ( - {  },   ) - P2 () with  : P2 () - , we get two homomorphisms

1 : 1 ( - { 2}, 1) - , 2 : 1 ( - { 1}, 2) - ,

whose images are the normal subgroups 1 and 2 defined in (10).

By construction, these are the homomorphisms induced by the restrictions

f :  -  of the Galois cover f :  -  О  to the fibres of the two

natural projections  :  О  - . Since  intersects transversally at a single

point all the fibres of the natural projections, it follows that both such restrictions

are branched at precisely one point, and the number of connected components of the

smooth curve    equals the index  := [ : ] of  in .

So, taking the Stein factorizations of the compositions   f :  -  as in the

diagram below



 f







(22)



we obtain two distinct Kodaira fibrations  :  -  , hence a double Kodaira fibration by considering the product morphism

 = 1 О 2 :  - 1 О 2 .

Definition 7 We call  :  - 1 О 2 the diagonal double Kodaira fibration associated with the pure braid quotient  : P() - . Conversely, we will say
that a double Kodaira fibration  :  - 1 О 2 is of diagonal type (, ) if there exists a pure braid quotient  : P() -  of the same type such that  is
associated with .

Since the morphism  :  -  is жtale of degree , by using the Hurwitz formula we obtain

1 - 1 = 1 ( - 1), 2 - 1 = 2 ( - 1).

(23)

Moreover, the fibre genera 1, 2 of the Kodaira fibrations 1 :  - 1 , 2 :  - 2 are computed by the formulae

so that the diagonal double Kodaira fibration  :  - 1 О 2 is a finite cover of degree | | , branched precisely over the curve
1 2
(1 О 2)-1 () = 1 О 2 .

Such a curve is always smooth, being the preimage of a smooth divisor via an жtale morphism. However, it is reducible in general, see [CaPol19, Proposition 3.11].

Remark 5 By definition, the pure braid quotient  : P2 () -  is strong (see Definition 3) if and only if 1 = 2 = 1, that in turn implies 1 = 2 = , i.e.,  = f. In other words,  is strong if and only if no Stein factorization as in (22) is needed or, equivalently, if and only if the Galois cover f :  -  О  induced by  is already a double Kodaira fibration, branched on the diagonal    О .

We can now compute the invariants of  as follows, see [CaPol19, Proposition 3.8].

Proposition 6 Let  :  - 1 О 2 be a diagonal double Kodaira fibration, associated with a pure braid quotient  : P2 () -  of type (, ). Then we have
21 () = | | (2 - 2) (4 - 4 + 4 - 2) 2 () = | | (2 - 2) (2 - 2 + )

where  = 1 - 1/. As a consequence, the slope and the signature of  can be expressed as

() = 21 () = 2 + 2 - 2

Remark 6 Not all double Kodaira fibrations are of diagonal type. In fact, if is of diagonal type, then its slope satisfies () = 2 + , where 0 <  < 6 - 4 2, see [Pol20, Proposition 3.12 and Remark 3.13].

We can now specialize these results, by taking as  an extra-special -group and
using what we have proved in Section 2.
Fix  = 2 and let   5 be a prime number. Then every extra-special -group  of order 4+1 = 9 is a non-strong pure braid quotient of type (2, ) and such that 1 = 2 = 2, see Theorem 1. Setting  := 4 + 1, cf. equations (23), by [CaPol19, Proposition 3.11] the associated diagonal double Kodaira fibration

 :  -  О  is a cyclic cover of degree , branched over a reduced, smooth

divisor  of the form

 (Z)2

where the  are pairwise disjoint graphs of automorphisms of  . By using Proposition 6, we can now construct infinitely many double Kodaira
fibrations with slope strictly higher than 2 + 1/3.

Theorem 4 ([CaPol19, Proposition 3.12], [Pol20, Theorem 3.8]) Let  :   -

 О  be the diagonal double Kodaira fibration associated with a non-strong

pure braid quotient  : P2 (2) -  of type (2, ), where  is an extra-special -group  of order 9. Then the maximum slope ( ) is attained for precisely two

values of , namely

Remark 7 The original examples by Atiyah, Hirzebruch and Kodaira have slope lying in the interval (2, 2 + 1/3], see [BHPV03, p. 221]. Our construction provides an infinite family of Kodaira fibred surfaces such that 2 + 1/3 < ()  2 + 12/35, maintaining at the same time a complete control on both the base genus and the signature. By contrast, the ingenious "tautological construction" used in [CatRol09] yields a higher slope than ours, namely 2 + 2/3, but it involves an жtale pullback "of sufficiently large degree", that completely loses control on the other quantities. Note that [LLR20] gives (at least in principle) an effective version of the pullback construction.
If  is a prime number dividing  + 1, by Theorem 2 every extra-special -group  of order 2+1 is a strong pure braid quotient of type (, ), and this gives in turn a diagonal double Kodaira fibration  :  -  О , see Remark 5. If  : N - N stands for the arithmetic function counting the number of distinct prime factors of a positive integer, see [HarWr08, p. 335], we obtain
Theorem 5 ([CaPol19, Corollary 3.18], [Pol20, Theorem 3.5]) Let  be any closed Riemann surface of genus . Then there exists a double Kodaira fibration  :  -  О . Moreover, denoting by () the number of such fibrations, we have
()  ( + 1).

In particular, lim sup () = +.
+
As far as we know, this is the first construction showing that all curves of genus   2 (and not only some special curves with extra automorphisms) appear in the

20

Francesco Polizzi and Pietro Sabatino

base of at least one double Kodaira fibration  :  -  О . In addition, two Kodaira fibred surfaces corresponding to two distinct prime divisors of  + 1 are non-homeomorphic, because the corresponding signatures are different: just use (24) with  =  and | | = 2+1 and note that, for fixed , the function expressing () is strictly increasing in . This shows that the number of topological types of , for a fixed base , can be arbitrarily large.
Let us now consider Theorem 3, whose geometrical translation is
Theorem 6 ([PolSab21, Theorem B]) Let  be a finite group and f :  -  О  be a Galois cover, with Galois group , branched over the diagonal  with branching order . Then | |  32, and equality holds if and only if  is extra-special. In this case, the following holds.
(1) There exist 2211840 = 1152 и 1920 distinct -covers f :  - 2 О 2, and all of them are diagonal double Kodaira fibrations such that

1 = 2 = 2, 1 = 2 = 41, () = 16.

(2) If  =  (32, 49) = H5 (Z2), these -covers form 1920 equivalence classes up to cover isomorphisms.
(3) If  =  (32, 50) = H5 (Z2), these -covers form 1152 equivalence classes up to cover isomorphisms.
As a consequence, we obtain a sharp lower bound for the signature of a diagonal double Kodaira fibration. In fact, the second equality in (24) together with Theorem 6 imply that, for every such fibration, we have

 и 32 и (2 и 2 - 2) 3

= 16,

and this in turn establishes the following result.
Theorem 7 ([PolSab21, Theorem C]) Let  be a double Kodaira surface, associated with a pure braid quotient  : P2 () -  of type (, ). Then ()  16, and equality holds precisely when (, ) = (2, 2) and  is an extra-special group of order 32.
Remark 8 If  is a double Kodaira fibration, corresponding to a pure braid quotient  : P2 () -  of type (, ), then, using the terminology in [CatRol09], it is very simple. Let us denote by  the connected component of the Gieseker moduli space of surfaces of general type containing the class of , and by M the moduli space of smooth curves of genus . Thus, by applying [Rol10, Thm. 1.7] and using the fact that    О  is the graph of the identity id :  - , we infer that every surface in  is still a very simple double Kodaira fibration and that there is a natural map of schemes
M - ,
which is an isomorphism on geometric points. Roughly speaking, since the branch locus    О  is rigid, all the deformations of  are realized by deformations

Finite quotients of surface braid groups and double Kodaira fibrations

21

of  О  preserving the diagonal, hence by deformations of , cf. [CaPol19, Proposition 3.22]. In particular, this shows that  is a connected and irreducible component of the Gieseker moduli space.

Every Kodaira fibred surface  has the structure of a real surface bundle over a real surface, and so () is divisible by 4, see [Mey73]. If, in addition,  has a spin structure, i.e. its canonical class is 2-divisible in Pic(), then () is a positive multiple of 16 by Rokhlin's theorem, and examples with () = 16 are constructed in [LLR20]. It is not known if there exists a Kodaira fibred surface with ()  12.
Constructing (double) Kodaira fibrations with small signature is a rather difficult problem. As far as we know, before the present work the only examples with signature 16 were the ones listed in [LLR20, Table 3, Cases 6.2, 6.6, 6.7 (Type 1), 6.9]. The examples in Theorem 7 are new, since both the base genera and the fibre genera are different from the ones in the aforementioned cases. Our results also show that every curve of genus 2 is the base of a double Kodaira fibration with signature 16. Thus, we obtain two families of dimension 3 of such fibrations that, to our knowledge, provides the first examples of positive-dimensional families of double Kodaira fibrations with small signature.
Theorem 7 also provide new "double solutions" to a problem, posed by G. Mess and included in Kirby's problem list in low-dimensional topology, see [Kir97, Problem 2.18 A], asking what is the smallest number  for which there exists a real surface bundle over a real surface with base genus  and non-zero signature. We actually have  = 2, also for double Kodaira fibrations.

Theorem 8 ([PolSab21, Theorem D]) Let  be a double Kodaira surface, associated with a pure braid quotient  : P2 () -  of type (2, 2), where  is an extraspecial group of order 32. Then the real manifold  underlying  is a closed, orientable 4-manifold of signature 16 that can be realized as a real surface bundle over a real surface of genus 2, with fibre genus 41, in two different ways.

It is an interesting question whether 16 and 41 are the minimum possible values for the signature and the fibre genus of a (non necessary diagonal) double Kodaira fibration  :  - 2 О 2; however, this topic exceeds the scope of this paper.

4 Beyond | | = 32
This last section contains the new result of this article. As we already observed, so far we have detailed a rather clear picture regarding pure braid quotient groups  and the relative diagonal double Kodaira fibrations for | |  32. Indeed, there is no pure braid quotient of order strictly less than 32 and for | | = 32 we have only the two extra-special groups, see Theorem 3. Furthermore, Theorem 2 provides examples of pure braid quotients starting with order equal to 128, see Remark 3, and they are extra-special groups, too. It seems then natural to investigate this matter further for | | > 32, for instance, in order to look for non extra-special examples. In this

22

Francesco Polizzi and Pietro Sabatino

direction we have obtained the following result that highlights the existence of a gap between orders 32 and 64.
Theorem 9 If  is a finite group with 32 < | | < 64, then  is not a pure braid quotient.
Here we just give a sketch of the proof, while the full details will appear elsewhere. We know that the group  cannnot be abelian, see Remark 2, and we also mentioned that CCT-groups cannot be pure braid quotients, see Remark 4. On the other hand, by [PolSab21, Section 3] we know that, if  is a pure braid quotient and admits no proper quotients that are pure braid quotients, then  must be monolithic, i.e., the intersection soc() of its non-trivial normal subgroups is non-trivial. In fact, consider the epimorphism  : P2 () -  and assume that there is a non-trivial, normal subgroup  of  such that ( 12)  . Then, composing the projection  - / with , we obtain a pure braid quotient » : P2 () - /, which leads to a contradiction. It follows that ( 12)  soc(), in particular  is monolithic.
By Theorem 3 this implies that, if a pure braid quotient  satisfies our assumptions on the order, then  must be monolithic. A straightforward computer calculation with GAP4 now shows that there are precisely two non-abelian groups  with 32 < | | < 64 that are both non-CCT and monolithic, namely  (54, 5) and  (54, 6); by the remarks above, they are the only possible candidates to be pure braid quotients in that range for | |. Finally, a brute force check (again by using GAP4) shows that these groups admit no diagonal double Kodaira structure, proving our assertion.
