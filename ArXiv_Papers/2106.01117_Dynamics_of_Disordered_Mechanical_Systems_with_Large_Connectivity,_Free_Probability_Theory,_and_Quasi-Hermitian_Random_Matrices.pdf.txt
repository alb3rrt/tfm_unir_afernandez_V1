Disordered mechanical systems with high connectivity represent a limit opposite to the more familiar case of disordered crystals. Individual ions in a crystal are subjected essentially to nearestneighbor interactions. In contrast, the systems studied in this paper have all their degrees of freedom coupled to each other. Thus, the problem of linearized small oscillations of such systems involves two full positive-definite and non-commuting matrices, as opposed to the sparse matrices associated with disordered crystals. Consequently, the familiar methods for determining the averaged vibrational spectra of disordered crystals, introduced many years ago by Dyson and Schmidt, are inapplicable for highly connected disordered systems. In this paper we apply random matrix theory (RMT) to calculate the averaged vibrational spectra of such systems, in the limit of infinitely large system size. At the heart of our analysis lies a calculation of the average spectrum of the product of two positive definite random matrices by means of free probability theory techniques. We also show that this problem is intimately related with quasi-hermitian random matrix theory (QHRMT), which means that the `hamiltonian' matrix is hermitian with respect to a non-trivial metric. This extends ordinary hermitian matrices, for which the metric is simply the unit matrix. The analytical results we obtain for the spectrum agree well with our numerical results. The latter also exhibit oscillations at the high-frequency band edge, which fit well the Airy kernel pattern. We also compute inverse participation ratios of the corresponding amplitude eigenvectors and demonstrate that they are all extended, in contrast with conventional disordered crystals. Finally, we compute the thermodynamic properties of the system from its spectrum of vibrations. In addition to matrix model analysis, we also study the vibrational spectra of various multi-segmented disordered pendula, as concrete realizations of highly connected mechanical systems. A universal feature of the density of vibration modes, common to both pendula and the matrix model, is that it tends to a non-zero constant at vanishing frequency.

I. INTRODUCTION

A. Small Oscillations

The problem of determining the small oscillations of a mechanical system about a stable equilibrium state is ubiquitous in physics. Thus, given a system with N degrees of freedom and corresponding generalized coordinates q = (q1, . . . qN ), its small oscillations about a stable equilibrium point q0 are solutions of the linearized equations of motion1­3

lutions of the form x(t) = Aeit, for which (1) implies

for the eigenvector amplitude and frequency eigenvalue.

Eigenfrequencies are roots of the characteristic polyno-

mial PN (2) = det -2M + K . These roots are all

positive,

since

to

(2),

is

the

ratio

of two positive quantities. This should be expected on

physical grounds, since in the absence of dissipation, the

eigenfrequencies  of a stable system are all real.

B. Quasi-Hermitian Matrices

We can rewrite the eigenmode equation (2) as H A = 2A, where the "hamiltonian" matrix43 is

H = M -1K and H  = KM -1 .

(3)

In general, [M , K ] = 0, and consequently H  = H . However, H and its adjoint fulfil the intertwining relation

H M = M H (= K ) .

(4)

This relation implies that H is hermitian in a vector space endowed with a non-trivial metric M , namely,

A1|H A2 M = H A1|A2 M ,

(5)

with inner product A1|A2 M = A1|M A2 = A1M A2 (and where, of course, A1|A2 = A1A2 is the standard inner product, corresponding to M = 1, with respect to which the adjoint H  in (4) is defined). The intertwining
relation (4) is equivalent to the similarity transformation

H  = M HM -1

(6)

between H and its adjoint. A corollary of this is that the characteristic polynomial of H has real coefficients: (det(z - H )) = det(z - H ) , consistent with the fact that all eigenvalues of H are real. Another way to establish positivity of the eigenvalues of H is to observe from (4) (or (6)) that both H and H  are similar to a positive hermitian matrix, namely,

H = 1

 h M,

and

 where we chose M as the positive definite square root

of M , and

is manifestly hermitian and positive. The matrix H is said to be4 a strictly quasi-hermitian matrix, due to its
similarity (7)to the hermitian matrix h. The similarity matrix S = M in (7) is hermitian as well. This need not be the case in general: A matrix H is said to be
strictly quasi-hermitian (sQH), if it is similar to a hermitian matrix h

H = S -1hS , and H  = S hS -1 ,

(9)

with S a complex invertible matrix. Thus, an sQH matrix H is diagonalizable, and all its eigenvalues are real. Moreover, it fulfils the intertwining relation

H  SS = SS H ,

(10)

which means that H is hermitian with respect to the metric M = S S .
If invertibility of the metric M is relaxed, then H is
merely a quasi-hermitian (QH) matrix. (For a useful clarification of terminology see5. In this paper we intro-
duce sQH matrices and make explicit distinction between
them and QH matrices.)
One can also consider sQH random matrix models
(see also Section II). An interesting sQH random matrix model was introduced in6. These authors used the fact that given a metric M = S S, then considering the inter-
twining relation (10) as an equation for H , its solution
is

H = AM , for any A = A .

(11)

Thus, given M , the linear homogeneous equation (10) has N 2 independent solutions for H . The authors of6 then
fixed a metric, and took the hamiltonian H as random,

2

with the aim of studying numerically the dependence of the average density of eigenvalues and level spacing statistics on the metric. Yet another interesting example of a sQH random matrix model, akin to the Dicke model of superradiance, was provided by7, in which a numerical study of the level spacing distribution was carried out.
It follows from (11) that the eigenvalue problem Hu = u for the sQH matrix H is equivalent to

(A~ - M )u = 0 ,

(12)

where we have introduced the hermitian matrix A~ =
M AM . (In the particular case corresponding to (2) we have, of course, A~ = K and  = 2.) The combination A~ - M in (12) constitutes what is known in the
mathematical literature as a regular pencil of matrices (or a regular pencil of quadratic forms)3,8. The qualifier regular means here that M and A~ are square matrices, and that det(A~ - M ) does not vanish identically. Thus,
eigenvalue problems for sQH matrices can always be as-
sociated with regular matrix pencils.
Quasi-hermitian matrices can be thought of as trun-
cated quasi-hermitian linear operators. For an early con-
sideration of quasi-hermitian operators (in which this term was coined) see9. For general considerations on
the construction of consistent quantum mechanical systems based on a QH hamiltonian and observables see10.
Such QH quantum mechanical systems are closely related to PT-symmetric quantum mechanical systems11,12
with unbroken PT symmetry. The latter possess real en-
ergy spectra due to the existence of a positive-definite
metric known as the CPT inner product. When the
metric operator ceases to be positive-definite, pairs of
complex-conjugate eigenvalues appear in the spectrum
of the hamiltonian, a situation referred to as broken PT-
symmetry. Operators satisfying the intertwining relation H M = M H with indefinite metric M are sometimes referred to as pseudo-hermitian (PH) operators13. The modern evocation of PH operators was made by14. For
a very brief but useful summary of the history of quasiand pseudo-hermiticity see5,15.
Upon truncation to finite vector spaces, pseudo-
hermitian operators turn into pseudo-hermitian matrices. See16 for a recent discussion of (real asymmetric)
pseudo-hermitian random matrices.

C. Plan of the rest of this paper
In Section II we first put the problem of vibration eigenmodes of highly connected systems in historic context, motivate application of QHRMT to study such systems, and contrast them with analysis of phonons in crystals. Next, as further motivation, we introduce a family of clean (uniform) and disordered multi-segmented pendula as concrete examples of highly connected mechanical systems. We study numerically the spectral statistics and localization properties of these systems in some

3

detail. Only then do we turn to defining our random matrix model, and study it in detail both analytically and numerically. In particular, we obtain an explicit large-N expression for the density of eigenvalues - that is, vibrational eigenfrequencies, and study its universal edge-behavior numerically. We also study its statistics of eigenvectors. An interesting observation is that the density of eigenfrequencies of both our matrix model and the pendula tend to a nonvanishing constant in the limit of small frequencies, which seems to be a common universal feature of highly connected systems. We have recently reported this universal behavior in17.
In Section III we explain how the diagrammtic approach of35 to S-transforms in free probability theory can be interpreted in terms of the Liouvillian of our mechanical system.
Finally, in Section IV we analyze the thermodynamic properties of phonons in our random matrix model at equilibrium.
II. STRICTLY QUASI-HERMITIAN RANDOM MATRIX THEORY FOR SMALL OSCILLATIONS
Under certain conditions, the problem of small oscillations (1)-(2) naturally lends itself to analysis by means of random matrices. One very important example is the determination of the average phonon spectrum of disordered crystals. This problem was solved long ago in onedimension by Dyson18 and Schmidt19. Individual ions in a disordered chain are subjected to nearest-neighbor interactions. Consequently, the mass matrix M is diagonal, and the spring-constant matrix K is tri-diagonal (a Jacobi matrix). Randomness arises either due to having random ion masses on the diagonal of M , or random spring constants in K (or due to both).
Disordered mechanical systems with high connectivity represent a limit opposite to the more familiar case of disordered crystals. Such systems have all their degrees of freedom coupled to each other. Thus, the problem of small oscillations in such systems involves two full positive-definite and non-commuting matrices M and K . Such systems may be inherently random (due to a random metric a(q) or potential U (q) in the lagrangian), or following Wigner's original introduction of random matrix theory into nuclear physics, may be just approximated by random matrices due to high structural complexity of the system under study.
A. Multi-Segmented Pendulum
As a concrete physical realization of the latter possibility, consider a multi-segmented pendulum made of N rigid (massless) segments of lengths l1, . . . lN and point masses m1, . . . mN . The mass mk is attached to the frictionless hinge connecting segments lk and lk+1, and carries electric charge Qk. The charges Q1, . . . QN are all

like-sign, say positive, rendering all Coulomb interactions

repulsive. The pendulum is suspended by the other end

of the first segment l1 from a frictionless hinge, which is fixed to an infinite mass m0 (a wall), carrying positive charge Q0. The whole system is suspended in Earth's gravity g, and is free to execute planar oscillations. (This

system can be thought of as a model for a charged (un-

screened) polymer chain in a uniform external field.)

Let k  [-, ] be the angle between the segment lk

and the downward vertical. Clearly, the stable equilib-

rium state of the system occurs when all segments align

vertically, i.e. when all k = 0. We have studied the small oscillations of this pendulum about its equilibrium state,

i.e. motions for which all |k|  1. The lagrangian gov-

The matrix U originates from the Coulomb potential energy. Note that the sum of entries in each row of this ma-
trix vanishes. This is simply a manifestation of translational invariance of the Coulomb interaction: It depends only on squares of differences of angles (i - j)2 (which arise from expanding cos(i - j) to the first nontrivial order). Therefore, shifting all i by the same amount 0 cannot change the Coulomb energy of the system. In par-
ticular, a configuration in which all masses align along a straight line making some fixed angle 0 with the vertical has the same Coulomb energy as the equilibrium configuration. In other words,  = (0, . . . 0)T must be a null eigenvector of the matrix U , which is indeed the case.
(The gravitational potential energy breaks this translational symmetry, of course.) Moreover, all other eigen-
values of U should be positive, since any distortion of the pendulum from a straight line configuration will cost en-
ergy due to Coulomb repulsion. Indeed, U is a diagonally dominant matrix, and is therefore positive semi-definite by virtue of Gershgorin's theorem21.
If all charges and masses are non-zero, M and K are
full matrices (the latter is due to the long-range Coulomb interaction), while in the pure gravitational model, for
which Q0 = Q1 = . . . = QN = 0, the matrix K is diagonal.
In order to get oriented, let us consider first the uniform pendulum, for which all lengths, masses and charges
are equal. As we want our system to have finite total length L and mass M when N  , segment lengths and

4

point masses must scale like lk  N -1 and mk  N -1. Under such circumstances the diagonal elements Uii (for

segments 1  i  N in the bulk of the pendulum) grow

like log N = log(L/l), because it is essentially the elec-

trostatic potential at a point somewhere on a uniformly

charged charges

rod like

of length Qk  (N

L22. log

Therefore, we have to scale N )-1, in order to balance

the the

Coulomb potential energy against gravitational potential

energy. Under this scaling of parameters, careful inspec-

tion of the matrices M and K shows that H = M -1K

scales like N 2, rendering its eigenvalue bandwidth scaling

likewise. We have investigated such a system numerically.

The solid lines in Fig. 1 represent histogram envelopes

for H (2), the (normalized) density of states (eigenvalues of H ), defined in Eq.(18), as a function of 2/N 2.

These lines correspond to the cases of a mixed system

with both Coulomb and gravitational interaction, a sys-

tem with purely Coulomb interaction, and a system with

purely gravitational interaction. Remarkably, as   0,

the density H (2) in all three cases diverges universally as

H (2)

(13)

(with coefficients c = 0 which vary from case to case).
This means that the density of frequency eigenmodes ~() = 2H (2), defined in Eq.(60), tends to a constant ~(0) = 2c in this limit.

FIG. 1: Histogram envelope curve showing the density of states (times N 2) for the multi-segmented pendulum as a function of 2/N 2. Solid lines correspond to uniform systems with all lengths, masses and charges being equal and set to lk = mk = 1/N and Qk = Q/(N log N ) with N = 16384. The three graphs correspond to Q = 1, g = 1 (red), Q = 0, g = 1 (yellow), and Q = 1, g = 0 (blue). The dotted lines in purple, green and cyan show the analogous curves respectively, when lengths, masses and charges are random and drawn from the probability distributions defined in the text, with mean values corresponding to the constant cases, and with N = 1024 averaged over 25000 samples. The dashed black line overlying the yellow line shows the Marchenko-Pastur distribution. The inset here (and in all figures below) shows a magnification of the edge behavior for the same data.

broader due to the combined Coulomb and gravitational forces acting on the masses. While the density of states in the purely gravitational model vanishes at the right edge of the spectrum like a square root, it exhibits a band-end discontinuity when Coulomb interactions are involved. Such discontinuous behavior of the density of states occurs also in other and completely different physical systems, such as Bloch electrons in a perfect crystal.
Finally, an utterly surprising observation, demonstrated by the coincidence of the yellow and black dashed lines in Fig. 1, is that the density of eigenvalues of the purely gravitational and completely deterministic system follows the Marchenko-Pastur distribution23 given by (26) below.
We have also studied the disordered pendulum, with lengths lk, masses mk and charges Qk all being i.i.d. random variables, drawn from probability distributions chosen such that the mean values of these variables would coincide with the corresponding values of these parameters in the uniform, undisordered systems displayed in Fig. 1, and with standard deviations  of the same order of magnitude at large-N as those averages. Specifically, the lks were taken from the uniform distribution on the interval (0.8/N, 1.2/N ), the mks from the uniform distribution on the interval (0.5/N, 1.5/N ), and the Qks were taken froma discrete distribution with equiprobable values 0.5/N log N and 1.5/N log N . The resulting averaged densities of states are displayed by the dotted lines in Fig. 1. Note that these densities of the disordered systems vanish at the high-frequency edge of the spectrum for all three cases. The band-end spectral discontinuities of some of the ordered uniform systems are smoothed out as a result of averaging over disorder.
More importantly, note that disorder does not change the universal low-frequency divergence (13). Evidently, low-frequency oscillations correspond to long-wavelength collective motions, which probe the large-scale structure of the pendulum, averaged over many random segments. Spectra of the disordered systems start to deviate from their uniform system counterparts only as the frequency increases, and oscillations become sensitive to the smaller scale structure of the system.
We have also studied numerically the normalized participation ratios (defined in Eq. (46)) and eigenfrequencyspacing distributions of our disordered pendula. The results are presented in Figs. 2 and 3, which exhibit similar qualitative behavior of the three pendulum types with gravitational, Coulomb or mixed interactions.
In Fig. 2 we have plotted the participation ratio as a function of /N . It appears that there are different scaling regimes. At higher frequencies, in the tails, /N is the correct scaling and we see that the normalized participation ratio decreases to zero like O(1/N ) as N increases, indicating well localized amplitude eigenvectors. As N increases, the main peaks in the plots move to the left while decreasing in height at a lower rate. The exact large-N scaling describing this phenomenon remains an open problem as well as the behavior very close to

5

the origin, where we observed large participation ratio fluctuations.
Fig. 3 displays the eigenfrequency spacing distributions for pendula of size N = 16384 (the yellow histograms in Fig. 2). For the eigenfrequencies k, k = 1, . . . , N , namely the square roots of eigenvalues of each sample, we define the unfolded spacings in the following way:
sk = (k+1 -k)~(k, k+1), k = 1, . . . , N -1, (14)
where ~(k, k+1) denotes the mean of the density (60) between frequencies k and k+1, averaged over all samples. We have collected all spacings sk from all samples and displayed the spacing distribution by the purple histogram envelope curves in Fig. 3. More detailed information can be gleaned from studying the spacing distri-

We have broken the frequency bandwidth into three different regions (displayed in Fig. 2) and all spacings from each region are displayed by histogram envelope curves: /N  r1 (blue), r1 < /N  r2 (red), /N > r2 (yellow). The global distribution is represented by the purple line, while for comparison we show the exponential (Poisson) distribution by the dashed line. The curve for each region is normalized to have weight one. The values for r1 and r2 are 0.044 and 0.143 (top), 0.032 and 0.223 (middle), 0.016 and 0.195 (bottom).

spacing distribution is close to the exponential (Poissonian) distribution displayed by the dashed line, showing that there is no repulsion between eigenvalues. This is consistent with the localized nature of the corresponding eigenvectors, as indicated by the O(1/N ) magnitude of their participation ratios. On the other hand, in the left, low frequency part of the band, displayed by the blue curves, the spacing distribution goes to zero for small spacings, demonstrating manifest repulsion. As we move from low frequencies into the FWHM part of the band, represented by the red curves in Fig. 3, we see that eigenmode repulsion decreases, despite the seizable participation ratios of the associated eigenvectors. The resolution of our numerical analysis is not fine enough to determine whether the red curves go all the way down to zero at zero spacing, indicating the absence of repulsion (although repulsion is clearly reduced the most for purely gravitational pendula).
There is clearly a crossover between maximal repulsion at small frequencies to zero repulsion, Poissonian spacing distribution at high frequecies, but the transitionary region includes extended eigenstates with appreciable participation ratios. This is to be contrasted with the analogous crossover in the one-dimensional finite size Anderson model, with clear cut correlation between minimally localized states in the middle of the band with strong level repulsion, and maximally localized states at the band edges, with Poissonian spacing distribution. After all, the matrix pencil spectral problem (2) for our pendula, with its full and nontrivial metric M , high connectivity and long-range interactions, is different from the corresponding spectral problem for disordered crystals with nearest-neighbor interactions, which are avatars of Anderson's model.
B. Random Matrix Model
The matrices M and K corresponding to small oscillations of the pendula discussed in Section II A are full and rather complicated functions of the 3N parameters entering the problem. Such highly connected systems clearly lend themselves to analysis in terms of random matrices.
The authors of24 have applied RMT to studying heat transfer by a highly connected and disordered network of oscillators. A considerable simplification occurring in24, as compared to the systems discussed in the present paper, is that the mass matrix M is simply proportional to the unit matrix. Thus, these authors needed only to apply standard RMT techniques to analyze the random matrix K .
At the next level of complexity lies the analysis carried in25 of the spectral statistics of real symmetric random matrix pencils with a deterministic diagonal metric, with nice application to fully connected electrical LCnetworks. (See also23,26 for earlier work on such pencils.)
For an interesting recent application of RMT to studying the vibrational spectra of glassy media, in which the

Marchenko-Pastur distribution plays an important role, see27.
The methods tailored for disordered chains or crystals18­20, as well as the more standard RMT methods used in24, are inapplicable for determining the average phonon (or vibrational) spectra of systems described
by full non-commuting random matrices M and K . This requires a different approach:
Since there is no reason to expect any statistical correlation between these two matrices, we shall draw them
from two independent probability ensembles. The matrix elements of either M or K cannot be distributed indepen-
dently. The elements of each matrix are correlated by the fact that these matrices are positive. By definition, these
matrices are also real. The least biased way to fulfil these constraints is to take these matrices to be of Wishart form C T C , with C an N × N real Ginibre matrix28. We shall however henceforth relax the constraint that M and K
be real, and take them to be positive hermitian, with C drawn from the complex Ginibre probability ensemble

P(C )

(15)

with the variance tuned such that the eigenvalues of C are spread uniformly in a disk of finite radius  in the complex plane, as N tends to infinity. Here Z is a normalization factor, and expectation values are given by

F (C , C )  =  dReCij dImCij  P(C )F (C , C )

i,j=1

(16)

Thus, we form two such independent complex Ginibre

ensembles, one for K = C 1C 1 with variance K2 , and another for M = C 2C 2 + m0 with variance M 2 . The positive shift parameter m0 ensures that M  m0 is strictly positive with probability one, as it should be.

Such a generalization from real into complex matrices

should not change the vibration spectrum in the thermo-

dynamic limit. We have verified this expectation numer-

ically: The difference between real and hermitian ma-

trices amounts only to small finite-N corrections at the

high frequency band-edge, which vanish as N tends to

infinity (see Fig. 4). Of course, a more detailed inves-

tigation of the spectral statistics of such systems, such

as studying level-spacings, will depend on whether one

is studying real or complex matrices. In this paper we

focus exclusively on the average spectrum in the thermo-

dynamic limit, which is not affected by taking M and K

to be complex hermitian. Issues of more detailed spectral

statistics of such systems is an open problem.

By making this innocuous generalization to complex

Ginibre matrices, we can straightforwardly bring techniques of free probability theory29,30 to bear, and use

them to obtain the average spectrum analytically.

Having defined the probability ensembles for M and K ,

we draw a pair of such matrices from their corresponding ensembles and compute the random matrix H = M -1K ,

in accordance with (3).

FIG. 4: Histogram envelope curve showing the density of eigenvalues H (2) of the mechanical system for complex ma-
trices with N = 64 (blue) and N = 1024 (purple) and for real
matrices with N = 64 (red) and N = 1024 (yellow), calculated from 2 × 107 samples (N = 64) and 50000 samples
(N = 1024). The parameters of the system are µ = m0 = 0.5, M = K = 1 (that is, 02 = 1). The dashed black line shows the theoretical large N prediction for complex matrices given
by (43). The inset here (and in all figures below) shows a
magnification of the edge behavior for the same data.

C. Free Probability Theory

The random matrix H is the product of two statistically independent, positive-definite random matrices, taken from unitary-invariant probability ensembles. Indeed, the random matrix X = M -1, like M , has a probability distribution invariant under unitary rotations. After a straightforward calculation, one obtains its probability distribution as

Q(X

)

=

X -1 - m0 (det X )2N

N M 2

Tr

(X -1-m0)

(24)

where the matricial step function (·) enforces positivity of X -1 - m0 (= C 2C 2), and N is a normalization factor.
The S-transform of free probability theory29,30 is a common tool for calculating the resolvent and density of eigenvalues of products like H , in the large-N limit. In our case, it reduces the calculation of (17) to solving a certain cubic equation (see (38)). The procedure is as follows: Compute the resolvents of X and K , then compute the S-transfroms of these resolvents and multiply them together to obtain the S-transform of H , and finally, make an inverse transform of the latter to obtain the resolvent (17) of H .
The resolvent

is a special case of a more general expression obtained long ago by Marchenko and Pastur23, and it can be derived in several ways32. It is analytic in the cut complex-z plane, with branch points at z = 0, 42.The cut emanat-
ing from each branch point runs to the left, along the
real axis. With this assignment of the cuts, G(z; ) is pure-imaginary along the segment [0, 42], which is the
support of the average density of eigenvalues

The resolvent GK (z; K ) of K is simply G(z; K ), and its first moment is non-vanishing. (The latter is a tech-
nical requirement for applying the S-transform.) The resolvent of X = M -1 can also be obtained from (25) in
a straightforward manner:

The next step30 in computing the S-transform of any of

the aforementioned resolvents G(z) amounts to defining

a related function

(z)

=

1 z

G

1 z

-1.

(29)

Recall that G(z) is the generating function for the mo-

ments µn =

of the positive definite random

matrix A(= K , M -1):

G(z)

=

 n=0

µn zn+1

,

(30)

where of course µ0 = 1, and µ1 > 0 by assumption. Thus,



(z) = µnzn .

(31)

n=1

In particular, this means that

lim
z0

(z) z

=

µ1

>

0.

(32)

Let (u) be the functional inverse of (z), that is the solution of

((z)) = z ,

(33)

consistent with (32). Thus, in case (33) has several roots

for

(u),

we

pick

that

root

which

behaves

like

u µ1

as

u



0. Then, finally, the S-transform of G(z) is defined as

S(u)

=

u

+ u

1 (u) .

(34)

Following this procedure, we thus obtain the S-
transforms of GK (z; K ) and GM -1 (z; m0, M ), respectively, as

SK (u)

SM -1 (u)

We now multiply the two expressions in (35) to obtain the S-transform of H ,

u+1

SH (u) = SM -1 (u)SK (u) = u H (u) .

(36)

We thus find



H (u)

u

m0 M 2

2+4mM 2 0  ,

(37)
which is the functional inverse of H (z). After some work, we thus obtain from (33) a quartic equation for
H (z), which contains a factor H + 1. Since H is not identically constant, we can safely divide through by this
factor and obtain a cubic equation for H . Finally, by virtue of (29), this cubic equation leads to a cubic equa-
tion for GH (z; m0, M , K ):

This

equa-

tion is consistent with the scaling law (20), and we can

write it in terms of the rescaled variables (21) more com-

pactly as

where we have defined

GH (z; m0, M , K ) = GH (; µ, 1, 1)

D. Analytical Derivation of the Density of Eigenvalues

Our main objective is to calculate H (2). Based on

(23)

it

is

enough

to

determine

H (x; µ)

=

1 

Im(x-i;

µ).

Therefore we should look for complex solutions of (39)

along the Re = x axis. More specifically, we are looking

there for a pair of complex-conjugate roots. Thus, we

should analyze the discriminant

(x) = xp3(x),

(41)

of (39) and find where it is negative. In (41) p3 is the cubic polynomial

p3(x) = (µ + 4)µ3x3 + 2µ2(µ2 + 2µ - 6)x2 + (µ3 - 4µ2 - 20µ + 12)µx - 4(µ3 + 3µ2 + 3µ + 1).

The discriminant of p3 is p3 = -16µ8(µ2 + 10µ + 27)3

which is manifestly negative for all µ > 0, meaning p3(x) has only one real root

x1

with

1 = 2µ7(µ5 + 24µ4 + 264µ3 + 1574µ2 + 4806µ + 5832), 1 = 432µ14(µ + 4)2(µ2 + 10µ + 27)3.

It can be shown that x1 is positive. Thus for positive µ, (x) is negative only along the interval (0, x1), and

this is where (39) has a pair of complex-conjugate roots. This interval, or more precisely (0, 02x1), is therefore the desired support of H (2), as can be inferred from (20)(21). This support is purely positive as it should be,
due to positivity of the matrix H . The endpoint x1 as a function of µ is plotted in Fig. 6. We see that x1(µ) is a monotonically decreasing function, which should be expected physically because 2  M -1K  1/µ.
Picking that root of the cubic (39) which has positive
imaginary part along [0, x1] we thus find

H (x; µ)

=

1 2 3x(x

where

 = x(x + 1) -27(x),  = µ2x4 + 2µ(µ - 1)x3 + (µ2 - 5µ + 1)x2 - 3(µ + 1)x.

Thus, by substituting x = (/0)2 in (43) and using (23),

we obtain H (2) as desired.



H (x; µ)diverges at the origin like 1/ x, and vanishes

at x1 like x1 - x (with known coefficients). This di-

vergence of H (x; µ) like 1/ x  1/ at the origin is

reminiscent the behavior (13) of pendula, indicating a

universal such behavior of the density of vibration eigen-

modes of highly connected systems at low frequencies.

Let Hnu,mN (2) denote the finite N averaged density of the mechanical system from numerical simulations. It is

described by the curves in the following plots. They are

the envelope curves gleaned from histograms with very

narrow bins. These curves for Hnu,mN (2) are in excellent agreement, when N is large, with the analytical expres-

sion for H (2) as obtained from (23) and (43). In Fig. 7 we show a histogram from one sample which demon-

strates self-averaging of the eigenvalue density of large

matrices. In Fig. 8 we display Hnu,mN obtained by averaging over a million samples, and compare it to H , for various values of the parameter M . Note that in the limit 1/µ  0, Hnu,mN (2) converges to the Marchenko-Pastur density (dotted line in Fig. 8) as should be expected,
because in this limit the matrix M becomes deterministic and proportional to the unit matrix. In the opposite limit of large M (or equivalently µ  0), the density looks qualitatively different from the Marchenko-Pastur profile. In fact, at µ = 0, (39) reduces to a quadratic
equation.

E. Universal Edge Behavior of the Density

In Fig. 9 we show numerical results for the density, with a fixed choice of parameters (corresponding to having 02 = 1 and x = 2) and for various values of N . Convergence of the numerical results to the theoretical large-N curve in the bulk is rapid, whereas convergence close to the high frequency (soft) edge is non-uniform, with visible finite-N corrections. The model with complex matrices clearly exhibits oscillatory behavior (see Fig. 9) towards the high frequency edge, as in the canonical GUE case. On the other hand, the model with real matrices has non-oscillatory edge behavior, like in the GOE case (as can be seen in Fig. 4). Referring back to the complex case, we expect its edge behavior to be in the Airy universality class, because inthe large-N limit the density vanishes at the edge like x1 - x. We verified this expectation numerically as can be seen in Fig. 10. To this end we studied the rescaled density

Hed,gNe () = rN 1/3Hnu,mN (x1 + rN -2/3),

(44)

where r = r(µ) is an N -independent parameter. This Hed,gNe seems to converge uniformly to the diagonal part of the Airy kernel,

F. Eigenvectors and their Participation Ratio

Consider the normalized eigenvector A(2) of H in (2), corresponding to eigenvalue 2 with components A. The (normalized) participation ratio33 is the function of 2

p(2)

=

1 N

N =1

|A

(

2)|4

.
M ,K

(46)

It is a measure of the fraction (out of N ) of degrees of freedom of the system that are effectively involved in a given state of vibration. In addition to the participation ratios of eigenvectors of the three types of pendula, displayed in Fig. 2, we have also computed numerically the participation ratios for the complex and real matrix models.
For random matrices, contrary to the case of pendula, our numerical results (see Fig. 11) show that these participation ratios are independent of the eigenvalue 2 and converge to constants as N increases. This means that in both complex and real matrix models all states are extended. That is, in all vibrational modes, essentially all degrees of freedom oscillate with amplitudes of the same order of magnitude. In other words, vibration eigenmodes tend to be collective throughout the frequency band. Moreover, these constant values seem to be universal (for various values of µ) and approach (for large N ) the value of 0.50 in the complex case and 0.33 for the real model. Interestingly, these numerical results coincide, respectively, with the participation ratios of the canonical GUE and GOE (even for low N ). In the large N limit it is straightforward to compute the GUE and

GOE participation ratios from the Porter-Thomas probability distributions34 for eigenvector components upon
neglecting correlations between eigenvector components. In hindsight, this coincidence with GUE and GOE is per-
haps not surprising and hints at a broader universality of our results.

III. THE LIOUVILLIAN AND DIAGRAMMATIC DERIVATION OF S-TRANSFORMS

Derivation of the S-transform formula for multiplying statistically independent hermitian random matrices by means of large-N planar diagrams was given in35. The idea is simple and elegant: Let A and B be two N × N statistically independent random matrices. In order to calculate the averaged resolvent of AB one should study the resolvent of the doubled-size matrix

Q=

0A B0

,

(47)

because the upper diagonal block of this resolvent

1 w-Q

=

w

w2-AB

w2

1 -BA

B

w2

A

w2-BA

(48)

is essentially the desired resolvent of AB. By expanding the left-hand-side of (48) in inverse powers of w and averaging over the appropriate powers of Q, we obtain the diagrammatic expansion of (48). In the large-N limit only planar diagrams survive, in which lines cannot cross. From this fact, and from the block structure of Q and its powers, one can prove the S-transform product formula by consistently resumming planar diagrams.
We should comment that a tacit assumption made by the authors of35 is that the spectra of AB and BA are real, because the perturbative expansion in powers of

(purple) and N = 8192 (yellow). The parameters of the complex model are µ = 0.1, M = K = 1 (02 = 1). The dashed black line shows the theoretical large-N prediction given by
(43).

w-1 assumes analyticity of all the resolvents involved off the real axis. This means that AB should be quasihermitian44. Thus, at least one of the matrices should be positive definite (to serve as the non-trivial metric see (11)). This observation should be kept in mind when reading35. Diagrammatic derivation of the multiplication formula under the assumption that at least one of the matrices is positive (but not necessarily both) is a bit stronger than conventional free multiplication. The latter assumes both A and B are positive definite - a condition which guarantees commutativity of free multiplication. If neither of these matrices is positive definite, one has to double (47) and use the chiral 4N × 4N hermitized form of Q, that is,

Q~ =

0Q Q 0

(49)

in order to compute the resolvent of AB by means of planar diagrams36.
We shall now give a very basic physical interpretation
of the trick of using (47) for diagrammatic derivation of the multiplication formula: The hamiltonian governing

been chosen as r  19.7 to give good matching.

Note that this hamiltonian time evolution preserves

phase-space volume,

If the initial conditions in (54) coincide with one of the

normal modes of the system with frequency , clearly

x(t) p(t)

Thus, the corresponding eigenvalue of L is i. Another way to see this is to note that

L2 = -

and recall from (4) that H and H  are similar to each other and have eigenvalues 2.
The Laplace transform of (54) involves the resolvent of L. We readily obtain

Let us now average (56) over PK (C 1) and PM (C 2) in (15) and trace the four N × N blocks. The desired resol-

IV. STATISTICAL MECHANICS OF PHONONS IN THE RANDOM MATRIX MODEL

(63)

We have carried numerical integration of (63) over the explicit expression for H (2) in Eq. (43), and compared
them to the results obtained by direct numerical aver-

aging over realizations of the random matrix ensembles.

The results are displayed in the Figs. 12 and 13 where

we have only plotted the curves obtained from integra-

tion of the theoretical density for complex matrices (the

relative errors compared to the other ones have been of order 10-6 for complex matrices and of 10-3 for real

matrices). At large temperatures cV /kB goes to 1 (the

classical limit) while u(T ) goes to kBT (classical equipar-

tition). High where max =

just the spectral sum over all ZPE up to exponentially

small corrections  e- . Consequentially cV is exponentially small and gets most of its contribution from

the low frequency part of the spectrum. For large µ (see

the purple plot in Fig. 13), as we discussed earlier, the

spectral density tends to the Marchenko-Pastur profile,

which has significant spectral weight at small frequencies.

Thus, cV decays very slowly as a function of  for large values of µ.

Summary. We have studied the vibration spectrum

of highly connected systems. We have studied both

concrete highly connected mechanical systems, namely,

multi-segmented pendula, and also formulated a random

matrix model describing such systems and analyzed it in

detail. The latter analysis was achieved by employing

13
S-transform techniques of free probability theory. Inside the bulk the analytical expression for the density of eigenvalues agrees well with simulations for finite N , but shows noticeable deviations at the edge, as it is typical for the large N solution of the spectrum of random matrices. At the edge, numerics for the complex model shows an accurate fit with the Airy-kernel. Analytical treatment of this edge behavior is beyond the reaches of our approach and requires further investigation. Additional numerical results include the participation ratio of eigenvectors, which for the random matrix model shows that all vibration eigenmodes are extended, while there is a crossover from extended to localized eigenvectors for disordered pendula. Finally, based on our explicit analytical results for the density of eigenmodes, we have computed the thermodynamic properties of our matrix model in equilibrium.
An important result of this paper is that the density of eigenfrequencies ~() of both our matrix model and pendula tend to a nonvanishing constant in the limit of small frequencies, which seems to be a common universal feature of highly connected systems. Low frequency modes are long-wavelength collective vibration modes, and they are expected to probe the mechanical system as a whole, in some sense. Thus, it is quite surprising that the density of these modes in our highly connected systems is qualitatively the same as that of acoustic phonons in onedimensional perfect crystals, with its nearest-neighbor interatomic interactions, which is also flat constant. More formally, if we think of our "hamiltonian" H as the discrete laplacian of some graph associated with our highly connected mechanical system, then the spectral dimension dS of that graph is defined by the scaling behavior H (2)  (2)dS/2-1 for (/0)2  137, familiar from the theory of diffusion on fractal graphs38,39 (see also40). Thus for our system, indeed dS = 1, which seems to be a universal feature of vibrational spectra of highly connected systems. Spectral dimension dS = 2 seems to correspond to the vibrational spectrum of globular proteins41. For a very recent discussion of spectral di-
