## Abstract

In this paper we attempt to develop a general $p-$Bergman theory on bounded domains in $\mathbb C^n$. To indicate the basic difference between $L^p$ and $L^2$ cases, we show that the $p-$Bergman kernel $K_p(z)$ is not real-analytic on some bounded complete Reinhardt domains when $p\ge 4$ is an even number. By the calculus of variations we get a fundamental reproducing formula. This together with certain techniques from nonlinear analysis of the $p-$Laplacian yield a number of results, e.g., $\frac12-$Hölder continuity of the off-diagonal $p-$Bergman kernel $K_p(z,\cdot)$ for fixed $z$, and stability of $K_p(z,w)$ as $p$ varies. We also show that the $p-$Bergman metric $B_p(z;X)$ tends to the Carathéodory metric $C(z;X)$ as $p\rightarrow \infty$ and the generalized Levi form $i\partial\bar{\partial}\log K_p(z;X)$ is no less than $\frac{p}{2(p-1)}\, B_p(z;X)^2$ for $p\ge 2$ and $ \frac{p}2\, C(z;X)^2$ for $p\le 2.$ Several comparison results of $K_p(z)$ and $K_2(z)$ for bounded pseudoconvex domains with $C^2-$boundary are obtained.
