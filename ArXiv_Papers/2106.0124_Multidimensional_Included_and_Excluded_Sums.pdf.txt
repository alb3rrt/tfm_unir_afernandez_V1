1 Introduction

These problems give rise to the excluded-sums

Many scientific computing applications require reducing many (potentially overlapping) regions of a tensor, or multidimensional array, to a single value for each region quickly and accurately. For example, the integral-image problem (or summed-area table) [7, 11] preprocesses an

problem [13], which underlies applications that require reducing regions of a tensor to a single value using a binary associative operator. For example, the excludedsums problem corresponds to the translation of the local expansion coefficients within each box in the FMM [16]. The problems are called "sums" for ease of presentation,

Definition 1. (Included and Excluded Sums) An algorithm for the included-sums problem takes as input a -dimensional tensor  :    with size  and a box size k = (1, 2, . . . , ). It produces a new tensor  :    such that every output element [x] holds the reduction under  of elements within the k-box of  cornered at x. An algorithm for the excluded-sums problem is defined similarly, except that the reduction is of elements outside the k-box cornered at x.
In other words, an included-sums algorithm computes, for all x = (1, 2, . . . , )   , the value [x] =  [1 : 1+1, 2 : 2+2, . . . ,  : +]. It's messier to write the output of an excluded-sums problem using colon notation, but fortunately, our proofs do not rely on it.
As we have noted in Section 1, there are weak and strong versions of both problems which allow and do not allow an operator inverse, respectively.
Prefix and Suffix Sums The prefix-sums operation [4] takes an array a = (1, 2, . . . , ) of  elements and returns the "running sum" b = (1, 2, . . . , ) ,

Included Sums in 1D Before investigating the included sums in higher dimensions, let us first turn our attention to the 1D case for ease of understanding. Figure 13 presents an algorithm BDBS-1D which takes as input a list  of length  and a (scalar) box size1  and outputs a list  of corresponding included sums. At a high level, the BDBS-1D algorithm generates two intermediate lists  and , each of length  , and performs / prefix and suffix sums of length  on each intermediate list. By construction, for  = 1, 2, . . . ,  , we have [] = [/ :  + 1], and [] = [ : ( + 1)/].
Finally, BDBS-1D uses  and  to compute the included sum of size  for each coordinate in one pass. Figure 5 illustrates the ranged prefix and suffix sums in BDBS-1D, and Figure 6 presents a concrete example of the computation.
1For simplicity in the algorithm descriptions and pseudocode, we assume that  mod  = 0 for all dimensions  = 1, 2, . . . , . In implementations, the input can either be padded with the identity to make this assumption hold, or it can add in extra code to deal with unaligned boxes.

Overall, BDBS computes the full included sum of a tensor with  elements in ( ) time and ( ) space by performing the included sum along each dimension in turn.
Although we cannot directly use BDBS to solve the strong excluded-sums problem, the next sections demonstrate how to use the BDBS technique as a key subroutine in the box-complement algorithm for strong excluded sums.
4 Excluded Sums and the Box Complement
The main insight in this section is the formulation of the excluded sum as the recursive "box complement". We show how to partition the excluded region into 2 nonoverlapping parts in  dimensions. This decomposition of the excluded region underlies the box-complement for strong excluded sums in the next section.
First, let's see how the formulation of the "box complement" relates to the excluded sum. At a high level, given a box , a coordinate x is in the "-complement" of  if and only if x is "out of range" in some dimension   , and "in the range" for all dimensions greater than .

Generalizing to Arbitrary Dimensions The main focus of this work is multidimensional included and excluded sums. Computing the included sum along an arbitrary dimension is almost exactly the same as computing it along 1 dimension in terms of the underlying ranged prefix and suffix sums. We sketch an algorithm BDBS that generalizes BDBS-1D to arbitrary dimensions.
Let  be a -dimensional tensor with  elements

Given a box , the reduction of all elements at coordinates in () is exactly the excluded sum with respect to . The box complement recursively partitions an excluded region into disjoint sets of coordinates.
Theorem 4.1. (Recursive Box-complement) Let  be a box cornered at coordinates x = (1, . . . , ) and x = (1, . . . , ) in some coordinate domain  . The -complement of  can be expressed recursively in terms of the ( - 1)-complement of  as follows:

and let k be a box size. The BDBS algorithm computes the included sum along dimensions  = 1, 2, . . . ,  in turn. After performing the included-sum computation along dimensions 1, 2, . . . , , every coordinate in the output  contains the included sum in each dimension up to :

The 1-complement (a) prefix and (b) suffix steps perform a prefix and suffix along dimension 1 and an included sum along dimension 2. The numbers in (a),(b) represent the order of subroutines in those steps.

Experimental Setup We implemented all algorithms

in C++. We used the Tapir/LLVM [27] branch of the

LLVM [23, 24] compiler (version 9) with the -O3 and

-march=native and -flto flags.

All experiments were run on a 8-core 2-way hyper-

threaded Intel Xeon CPU E5-2666 v3 @ 2.90GHz with

30GB of memory from AWS [1]. For each test, we took

the median of 3 trials.

We found that the box-complement algorithm outperforms the corners algorithm by about 1.4О when given similar amounts of space, though the corners algorithm with 2О the space as the box-complement algorithm was 2О faster.
We explored two different methods of using extra space in the corners algorithm based on the computation tree of prefixes and suffixes: (1) storing the spine of the computation tree to asymptotically reduce the running time, and (2) storing the leaves of the computation tree to reduce passes through the output. Although storing the leaves does not asymptotically affect the behavior of the corners algorithm, we found that reducing the number of passes through the output has significant effects on

algorithms on a 3D domain of  = 4096 elements. (Although this domain may seem small, Appendix D shows that the results are relatively insensitive to domain size.) For inexpensive  operators, the box-complement algorithm is the second fastest, but as the cost of  increases, the box-complement algorithm dominates. The reason for this outcome is that box-complement performs approximately 12  operations per element in 3D, whereas the most efficient corners algorithm performs about 22  operations.

The weak naive algorithm for excluded sums with nested loops outperforms all of the other algorithms up to 2 dimensions because its runtime is dependent on the box volume, which is low in smaller dimensions. Since its runtime grows exponentially with the box length, however, we limited it to 5 dimensions.

BDBS and box-complement algorithms up to 6 dimensions, but its runtime scales exponentially in the number of dimensions.
Finally, the BDBS and box-complement algorithms scale linearly in the number of dimensions and outperform both naive and summed-area table methods in higher dimensions. Specifically, the box-complement algorithm outperforms the summed-area table algorithm by between 1.3О and 4О after 6 dimensions. The BDBS algorithm demonstrates an advantage to having an inverse: it outperforms the box-complement algorithm by 1.1О to 4О. Therefore, the BDBS algorithm dominates the box-complement algorithm for weak excluded sums.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced the box-complement algorithm for the excluded-sums problem, which improves the running time of the state-of-the-art corners algorithm from (2 ) to ( ) time. The space usage of the box-complement algorithm is independent of the number of dimensions, while the corners algorithm may use space dependent on the number of dimensions to achieve its running-time lower bound.
The three new algorithms from this paper parallelize straightforwardly. In the work/span model [10], all three algorithms are work-efficient, achieving ( ) work. The BDBS and BDBSC algorithms achieve ( log  ) span, and the box-complement algorithm achieves (2 log  ) span.

Figure 11: An example of the corners algorithm in 2 dimensions on an 1 О2 matrix using a (1, 2)-box cornered at (1, 2). The grey regions represent excluded regions computed via prefix and suffix sums, and the black boxes correspond to the corner of each region with the relevant contribution. The labels  ,  , ,  represent the combination of prefixes and suffixes corresponding to each vertex.
We can represent each length- combination of prefixes and suffixes as a length- binary string where a 0 or 1 in the -th position corresponds to a prefix or suffix (resp.) at depth . As illustrated in Figure 12, the corners algorithm defines a computation tree where each node represents a combination of prefixes and suffixes, and each edge from depth  - 1 to  represents a full prefix or suffix along dimension . The total height of this computation tree is , so there are 2 leaves.
Analysis. The most naive implementation of the corners algorithm that computes every root-to-leaf path

Proof. The corners algorithm must traverse the entire computation tree in order to compute all of the leaves. If it follows a depth-first traversal of the tree, one possible use of the extra ( ) allowed space is to keep the intermediate combination of prefix and suffices at the first  internal nodes along the current root-to-leaf path in the traversal. We will analyze this scheme in terms of 1) the amount of time that each leaf requires independently, and 2) the total shared work between leaves. The total time of the algorithm is the sum of these two components. Independent work: For each leaf, if the first  prefixes and suffixes have been computed along its root-to-leaf path, there are an additional ( - ) prefix and suffix computations required to compute that leaf. Therefore, each leaf takes (( - ) ) additional time outside of the shared computation, for a total of (2( - ) ) time. Shared work: The remaining time of the algorithm is the amount of time it takes to compute the higher levels of the tree up to depth  given a  factor in space. Given a node  at depth  with position  such that 1   < , the amount of time it takes to compute the intermediate sums along the root-to-leaf path to  depends on the difference in the bit representation between  and  - 1. Specifically, if  and  - 1 differ in  bits, it takes

  2-  2+1 = (2 ).

Putting it together: Each leaf also requires ( )

Lemma B.1. (Correctness in 1D) BDBS-1D solves the included sums problem in 1 dimension.

Proof. Consider a list  with  elements and box length . We will show that for each  = 1, 2, . . . ,  , the output [] contains the desired sum. For  mod  = 1, this holds by construction. For all other , the previously defined prefix and suffix sum give the desired result. Recall that [] = [ +  - 1] + [], [] = [ : ( + 1)/ и ], and [ +  - 1] = [( +  - 1)/ и  :  + ]. Also note that for all  mod  = 1, ( +  - 1)/ = ( + 1)/.
