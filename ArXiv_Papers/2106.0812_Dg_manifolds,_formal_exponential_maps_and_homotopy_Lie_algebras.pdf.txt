Abstract. This paper is devoted to the study of the relation between `formal exponential maps,' the Atiyah class, and Kapranov L[1] algebras associated with dg manifolds in the C context. Given a dg manifold, we prove that a `formal exponential map' exists if and only if the Atiyah class vanishes. Inspired by Kapranov's construction of a homotopy Lie algebra associated with the holomorphic tangent bundle of a complex manifold, we prove that the space of vector fields on a dg manifold admits an L[1] algebra structure, unique up to isomorphism, whose unary bracket is the Lie derivative w.r.t. the homological vector field, whose binary bracket is a 1-cocycle representative of the Atiyah class, and whose higher multibrackets can be computed by a recursive formula. For the dg manifold (TX0,1[1], ¯) arising from a complex manifold X, we prove that this L[1] algebra structure is quasi-isomorphic to the standard L[1] algebra structure on the Dolbeault complex 0,·(TX1,0).

1. Introduction

This paper, which is a sequel to [37], is devoted to the study of some differential geometric aspects of dg manifolds in the C context. Dg manifolds (a.k.a. Q-manifolds [1, 38, 44]) have increasingly attracted attention recently due to their relevance in various fields of mathematics, in particular, mathematical physics. They first appeared in the mathematical physics literature in the study of BRST operators used to describe gauge symmetries. They play an essential role in the so called AKSZ formalism in the study of sigma model quantum field theories [1, 13]. They arise naturally in a variety of situations in differential geometry, Lie theory, representation theory and homotopy algebras [27, 54, 52, 53, 20]. They are closely related to the emerging fields of derived differential geometry [5, 11, 12, 23, 39, 40, 48] and higher Lie algebroids [4, 7, 8, 9, 19, 21, 22, 43, 54, 52, 46] (see also [45, Letters 7 and 8]).

Recall that a dg manifold is a Z-graded manifold M endowed with a homological vector field, i.e. a degree +1 derivation Q of C(M) satisfying [Q, Q] = 0. When the underlying Z-graded
manifold M is a Z-graded vector space, a dg manifold is equivalent to a finite dimensional curved
L algebra (or more precisely a curved L[1] algebra). Any complex manifold naturally gives rise to a dg manifold, as does any foliation of a smooth manifold. See Examples 2.2 and 2.3.

The exponential map plays an important role in classical differential geometry. In graded geometry,
it turns out that a certain `formal exponential map' is more useful. Let us describe examples,
which illustrate the concept of `formal exponential map' we have in mind. First of all, let us
recall the relation between exponential map and Poincar´e­Birkhoff­Witt isomorphism (PBW
isomorphism in short) in classical Lie theory. Let G be a Lie group and let g be its Lie algebra. The
space D0(g) of distributions on g with support {0} is canonically identified with the symmetric tensor algebra S(g), while the space De(G) of distributions on G with support {e} is canonically identified with the universal enveloping algebra U(g). The classical Lie-theoretic exponential map exp : g  G,
which is a local diffeomorphism near 0, can be used to push forward the distributions on the Lie algebra to distributions on the Lie group. The induced isomorphism S(g) = D0(g) - De(G) = U (g) is precisely the symmetrization map realizing the well known PBW isomorphism. This construction
has an analogue for smooth manifolds. However, it requires a choice of affine connection. Given a smooth manifold M , let R denote its algebra of smooth real-valued functions C(M ). Each affine
connection  on M determines an exponential map

exp : TM  M × M,

(1)

which is a local diffeomorphism of fiber bundles

from a neighborhood of the zero section of TM to a neighborhood of the diagonal  in M × M . The space of fiberwise distributions on the vector bundle  : TM  M with support the zero section can be identified, as an R-coalgebra, to  S(TM ) . On the other hand, the space of fiberwise distributions on the fiber bundle pr1 : M × M  M with support the diagonal  can be identified, as an R-coalgebra, to the space D(M ) of differential operators on M . Pushing distributions forward
through the exponential map (1), we obtain an isomorphism of R-coalgebras

pbw :  S(TM )  D(M ),

called PBW map in [29, 30]. In other words, pbw is the fiberwise -order jet (along the zero section) of the exponential map (1) arising from the connection . Therefore, one can consider it as a `formal exponential map' associated with the affine connection .

We have the following explicit formula for pbw:

pbw(X0

···

Xk)(f ) =

dt0

0

dtk

f

exp(t0X0 + t1X1 + · · · + tkXk) ,

(4)

for all X0, X1, · · · , Xk  (TM ) and f  C(M ).

It turns out that the map pbw admits a nice recursive characterization which can be described

in a purely algebraic way [29, 30] involving the connection , but not the exponential map (1). Therefore, despite the geometric origin of the map pbw, this `formal exponential map' still makes

sense algebraically in a much wider context. By way of this purely algebraic description, the `formal

exponential map' was extended to the context of Z-graded manifolds over the field K (with K = R

or C) by Liao­Sti´enon [31]. The PBW map:

pbw :  S(TM)  D(M)

(5)

arising from an affine connection  on a Z-graded manifold M can be thought of as the induced formal exponential map (or the fiberwise -order jet) of a `virtual exponential map:'

exp : TM  M × M.

(6)

Now, let (M, Q) be a dg manifold. Then, both (S(TM)) and D(M) in (5) are dg coalgebras over the dg ring (C(M), Q) -- see Propositions 3.2 and 3.3. Here  S(TM) , LQ can be understood as the space of fiberwise dg distributions on the dg vector bundle  : TM  M with support the zero section -- the homological vector field on TM is the complete lift Q^ of the homological vector field Q  X(M) [37, 49]. On the other hand, D(M), LDQ can be identified with the space of fiberwise dg distributions on the dg fiber bundle pr1 : M × M  M with support the diagonal   M × M -- the homological vector field on M × M is (Q, Q). Recall that for an ordinary smooth manifold M , equipped with a vector field Q, the exponential map (1) arising from a choice of affine connection  on M identifies the complete lift1 Q^  X(TM) of Q  X(M) with the vector field (Q, Q)  X(M × M ) if and only if the connection  is invariant under the flow of Q. In the similar fashion, one may wonder whether the `virtual exponential map' (6) is a morphism of dg manifolds. On the level of fiberwise -order jets, this is equivalent to asking whether the map pbw :  S(TM) , LQ  D(M), LDQ is an isomorphism of dg coalgebras over (C(M), Q). As in classical geometry, one expects that this would be true if the affine connection  on M is invariant under the (virtual) flow of the homological vector field Q; in other words, if the Atiyah class of the dg manifold (M, Q) vanishes.
Our first main theorem confirms this assertion:
Theorem A (Theorem 3.5). Let (M, Q) be a dg manifold. The Atiyah class (M,Q) vanishes if and only if there exists a torsion-free affine connection  on M such that
pbw :  S(TM) , LQ  D(M), LDQ
is an isomorphism of dg coalgebras over (C(M), Q).

The Atiyah class of a dg manifold was first introduced by Shoikhet [47] in terms of Lie algebra cohomology and 1-jets of tangent bundles, appeared also in the work of Lyakhovich­Mosman­ Sharapov [33, Footnote 6], and was studied systematically in [37]. The Atiyah class of dg manifolds plays a crucial role in the Kontsevich­Duflo type theorem for dg manifolds [32, 49]. Below we recall its definition in terms of affine connections [37].

Let (M, Q) be a dg manifold. Given an affine connection  on M, consider the (1, 2)-tensor At(M,Q)   M; TM   End(TM) of degree +1 defined by the relation

At(M,Q)(X, Y ) = [Q, X Y ] - [Q,X]Y - (-1)|X|X [Q, Y ],

for any homogeneous vector fields X, Y  X(M). Since LQ(At(M,Q)) = 0, the element At(M,Q) is a 1-cocycle called the Atiyah cocycle associated with the affine connection . The cohomology

class

(M,Q) := [At(M,Q)]  H1  M; TM   End(TM) ·, Q

does not depend on the choice of connection , and therefore is an intrinsic characteristic class

called Atiyah class of the dg manifold (M, Q) [37] -- see Proposition 2.5.

As shown by the pioneering work of Kapranov [24, 41, 42], the Atiyah class of a holomorphic vector bundle gives rise to L[1] algebras. These L[1] algebras play an important role in derived geometry [10, 35, 41] and the construction of Rozansky­Witten invariants [24, 26, 42, 51].

It is natural to expect that the Atiyah cocycle of a dg manifold gives rise to an L[1] algebra in a similar fashion. This is indeed true: the following theorem was announced in [37], but a proof was omitted. We will give a complete proof in the present paper.

Theorem B (Theorem 4.4). Let (M, Q) be a dg manifold. Each choice of an affine connection  on M determines an L[1] algebra structure on the space of vector fields X(M). While the unary bracket 1 : S1 X(M)  X(M) is the Lie derivative LQ along the homological vector field, the higher multibrackets k : Sk X(M)  X(M), with k  2, arise as the composition
k : Sk X(M)   Sk(TM) -R-k X(M)
induced by a family of sections {Rk}k2 of the vector bundles Sk(TM  )  TM starting with R2 = - At(M,Q).
Furthermore, the L[1] algebra structures on X(M) arising from different choices of connections are all canonically isomorphic.

The L[1] algebras arising in this way are called the Kapranov L[1] algebras of the dg manifold. Our proof of Theorem B is very much inspired by Kapranov's construction [24, Theorem 2.8.2]. Essentially, we endow  S(TM) with a dg coalgebra structure over (C(M), Q) using the PBW map (5) and the dg coalgebra D(M), LDQ , whose dual dg algebra can be considered as a kind of "the algebra of functions" on the "formal neighborhood" of the diagonal  of the product dg manifold M × M, (Q, Q) . By construction, pbw is a formal exponential map identifying a `formal neighborhood' of the zero section of TM to a `formal neighborhood' of the diagonal  of the product manifold M × M. The dg coalgebra structure on D(M) associated with the homological vector field (Q, Q) on M × M can be pulled back through this formal exponential map so as to obtain a dg coalgebra (S X(M ) , ), which in turn induces an L[1] algebra on X(M).
The Kapranov L[1] algebra of a dg manifold as in Theorem B is completely determined by the Atiyah 1-cocycle and the sections
Rk   Sk(TM  )  TM =  Hom(Sk(TM), TM)
for k  3. It is thus natural to wonder whether the Rk's can be described explicitly.
For the L[1] algebra structure on the Dolbeault complex (0,·(TX1,0), ) associated with the Atiyah class of the holomorphic tangent bundle TX of a K¨ahler manifold X, Kapranov showed that the multibrackets can be described explicitly by a very simple formula [37]: Equation (7) below. Consider the C-linear extension of the Levi-Civita connection of the K¨ahler manifold X; this is a TXC-connection  on TXC. Since X is Ka¨hler,  induces a TXC-connection on TX1,0, also denoted by ,

which decomposes as the sum  = ¯ + 1,0 of the canonical flat TX0,1-connection ¯ on TX1,0 and

some TX1,0-connection 1,0 on TX1,0. Since 1,0 is torsion-free and d1,0  d1,0 = 0  2,0(End T 1,0),

the curvature of  is R = [d , d1,0], which equals to R2

, the Dolbeault

representative of the Atiyah 1-cocycle of the holomorphic tangent bundle TX . Kapranov proved [24,

Theorem 2.6] that, for k 2, the k-th multibracket k on the Dolbeault complex (0,·(TX1,0), ) is

the composition of the wedge product

0,j1 (TX1,0)  · · ·  0,jk (TX1,0)  0,j1+···+jk (TX1,0)k

with the map

induced by

and that, for k 3,

Rk = d1,0 Rk-1  0,1 Sk(TX1,0)  TX1,0 .

(7)

If X is a mere complex manifold rather than a K¨ahler manifold, the relation between the Rk's is more complicated: it involves the Atiyah 1-cocycle R2, the curvature of 1,0, and their higher

covariant derivatives. Nevertheless, recursive computations are still possible as shown in [30].

In the present paper, we prove that a similar characterization of the higher multibrackets holds for the Kapranov L[1] algebra of a dg manifold:

Theorem C (Theorem 4.7).

(1) The sections Rn   Sn(TM  )  TM , with n  3, are completely determined, by way of a recursive formula, by the Atiyah cocycle At(M,Q), the curvature R, and their higher
covariant derivatives -- see (47).

Finally, we investigate the Kapranov L[1] algebras arising from two classes of examples of dg manifolds: those corresponding to finite dimensional L[1] algebras as described in Example 2.2, and those corresponding to manifolds endowed with integrable distributions, which include not only
foliated manifolds but also complex manifolds as described in Example 2.3. For the dg manifold
(g[1], dCE) associated with a finite-dimensional L[1] algebra g[1], we prove that the multibrackets of the Kapranov L[1] algebra structure on X(g[1]) = Hom S(g[1]), g[1] can be expressed in terms of the multibrackets of the L[1] algebra g[1] -- see Proposition 5.8. We also compute the Atiyah class of the dg manifold (g[1], dCE) in terms of Chevalley­Eilenberg cohomology of g[1] valued in the (co)adjoint module (g[1])  (g[1])  g[1] -- see Proposition 5.6. For the dg manifold (F [1], dF ) arising from an integrable distribution F  TKM on a smooth manifold M, we show that the Kapranov L[1] algebra structure on X(F [1]) is quasi-isomorphic to the L[1] algebra ·F (TKM/F ) arising from the Lie pair (TKM, F ), which was studied extensively in [29, 30]. In particular, for the dg manifold (TX0,1[1], ¯) associated with a complex manifold X, the Kapranov L[1] algebra structure on X(TX0,1[1]) is quasi-isomorphic to the L[1] algebra structure on the Dolbeault complex (0,·(TX1,0), ) associated with the Atiyah class of the holomorphic tangent bundle TX . Moreover, each map k in the quasi-isomorphism {k}k1 is X0,·-multilinear -- see Corollary 5.15.
Note that Bandiera [2, 3] proved that, when X is a K¨ahler manifold, the Kapranov L[1] algebra structure on 0,·(TX1,0) is homotopy abelian over the field C. It would be interesting to figure out if the L[1] algebra structure of Theorem B on the space X(M) of vector fields over a dg manifold (M, Q) is homotopy abelian over the field K, possibly by extending the techniques developed in [2,
3].

Notations and conventions. Throughout this paper, the symbol K denotes a field either R or C.
We reserve the symbol M to denote a smooth manifold (over K) exclusively. The sheaf of smooth K-valued functions on M is denoted OM = OMK . The algebra of globally defined smooth functions on M is C(M ) = OM (M ).
A (p, q)-shuffle is a permutation  of the set {1, 2, · · · , p + q} such that (1) < · · · < (p) and (p + 1) < · · · < (p + q). The set of (p, q)-shuffles will be denoted by Sqp.
We use the (sumless) Sweedler notation for the comultiplication  in any coalgebra C:

(c) = c(1)  c(2) = c(1)  c(2), c  C.
(c)

All gradings in this paper are Z-gradings and M will always be a finite dimensional graded manifold. Throughout the paper, `dg' means `differential graded.'

Given a graded vector space V , the suspension of V is denoted by V [1] satisfying V [1]n = V n+1. We denote the (internal) degree of an element v  V by |v|.

Many equations throughout the paper have the following general shape:

A(X1, X2, . . . , Xn) = (-1) (i,j)K |X(i)||X(j)|B(X(1), X(2), . . . , X(n)),

(8)

where X1, X2, . . . , Xn is a finite collection of Z-graded objects;  is a permutation of the set of indices {1, 2, . . . , n}; K is the set of couples (i, j) of elements of {1, 2 . . . , n} such that i < j and (i) > (j); and A and B are n-ary operations on the Z-graded objects X1, X2, . . . , Xn whose output is an object of degree |X1| + |X2| + · · · + |Xn|. The factor (-1) (i,j)K |X(i)||X(j)| appearing in the right hand side of (8) is called the Koszul sign of the permutation  of the graded objects
X1, X2, . . . , Xn. It will customarily be abbreviated as  since its actual value -- either +1 or -1 -- can be recovered from a careful inspection of both sides of the equation. We will also use the more
explicit abbreviation (X1, X2, · · · , Xn) if the collection of Z-graded objects begin permuted is not immediately clear. As explained by Boardman in [6], this sign is mostly inconsequential and it is
not necessary to devote much attention or thought to it. In fact, the right hand side of (8) can be
a sum of several terms so it would be more correct to say that the general shape of the equations is

A(X1, X2, . . . , Xn) =

(-1) (i,j)Kk |Xk(i)||Xk(j)|Bk(Xk(1), Xk(2), . . . , Xk(n)).

2. Preliminaries

2.1. dg manifolds. Let M be a smooth manifold over K, and OM be the sheaf of K-valued smooth functions over M . A graded manifold M with support M consists of a sheaf A of graded commutative OM -algebra on M such that there is a Z-graded vector space V satisfying
A(U ) = OM (U ) K HomK(S(V ), K) = OM (U ) K S(V )
for sufficiently small open set U  M . The global section of the sheaf A will be denoted by C(M) = A(M ). We say a graded manifold M is finite dimensional if dim M <  and dim V < . Throughout this paper, graded manifold M will always be finite dimensional.
Remark 2.1. In the literature, the sheaf of functions A over a graded manifold is defined by A(U ) = OM (U ) K S(V ) for sufficiently small open subsets U of M . Here, however, we allow for formal power series rather than polynomials: A(U ) = OM (U ) K S(V ) for sufficiently small open subsets U of M . Consequently, when we write `dg manifold' (M, Q), we actually mean formal dg manifold in Kontsevich's sense [25, Section 4.1]. Hence C(M) is not a graded algebra in the

DG MANIFOLDS, FORMAL EXPONENTIAL MAPS AND HOMOTOPY LIE ALGEBRAS

7

classical sense, i.e. C(M) is not the direct sum of its homogeneous subspaces. Indeed, it is the completion of a graded algebra. Nevertheless we will abuse terminology and write that C(M) is a graded algebra or (C(M), Q) is a dg algebra throughout the present paper.

By IA, we denote the sheaf of ideal of A consisting of functions vanishing at the support M of M. That is, for sufficiently small U  M ,
IA(U ) = OM (U ) K S1(V ).
Given graded manifolds M = (M, A) and N = (N, B), a morphism M  N of graded manifolds consists of a pair (f, ), where f : M  N is a morphism of smooth manifolds and  : f B  A is a morphism of sheaves of graded commutative OM -algebras such that (f IB)  IA. We often use the notation  : M  N to denote such a morphism. Then  = . Also, we write  : C(N )  C(M) to denote the morphism on global sections. Note that the condition (f IB)  IA is equivalent to  being continuous w.r.t the I-adic topology.
Vector bundles in the category of graded manifolds are called graded vector bundles. Given a graded vector bundle  : E  M, a section s : M  E of E over M is a morphism of graded manifolds such that   s = idM. We write the C(M)-module of sections of E over M by the usual notation (E) = (M; E).
For a graded manifold M = (M, A) with support M , its tangent bundle TM is a graded manifold with support TM and is a graded vector bundle over M. Its section is called vector field on M and the space of vector fields  M; TM =  TM can be identified with that of graded derivations of C(M). We also write  M; TM = X(M). Observe that there is Lie bracket structure on X(M), defined as the commutator
[X, Y ] = X  Y - (-1)|X|·|Y |Y  X for homogeneous elements X, Y  X(M), in terms of derivations of C(M). Indeed TM is a graded Lie algebroid [36].
A differential graded manifold (dg manifold in short) is a graded manifold M together with a vector field Q  X(M) of degree +1 satisfying [Q, Q] = Q  Q + Q  Q = 0. Such vector field Q is called a homological vector field. For a dg manifold (M, Q), its tangent bundle TM is naturally a dg manifold, with the homological vector field being the complete lift2 of Q, and in fact TM is a dg Lie algebroid over M [36, 37].
Example 2.2. Let g be a finite dimensional Lie algebra. Then (g[1], dCE) is a dg manifold, where dCE denotes the Chevalley­Eilenberg differential. Note that we have C(g[1]) = ·g as its algebra of functions.
This construction admits an `up to homotopy' version: Given a Z-graded finite dimensional vector space g = iZ gi, the graded manifold g[1] is a dg manifold, i.e. admits a homological vector field, if and only if g admits a structure of curved L algebra.
Example 2.3. For any smooth manifold M , (TM [1], ddR) is a dg manifold, where its algebra of functions C(TM [1]) is ·(M ), and the homological vector field Q is the de Rham differential ddR.
Likewise, associated to any complex manifold X, there is a dg manifold (TX0,1[1], ¯), where its algebra of functions C(TX0,1[1]) is 0,·(X), and the homological vector field Q is the Dolbeault operator ¯.
2It is also called tangent lift in the literature [37, 32].

Example 2.4. Given a smooth section s of a vector bundle E  M , we have a dg manifold (E[-1], s), where we have C(E[-1]) =  -·E as algebra of functions and Q = s, the interior product with s, as its homological vector field. This dg manifold can be thought of as a smooth
model for the (possibly singular) intersection of s with the zero section of the vector bundle E, and
is often called a `derived intersection', or a quasi-smooth derived manifold [5].

Both situations in Example 2.3 are special instances of Lie algebroids, while Example 2.4 is a special case of derived manifolds [5].

2.2. Atiyah class. Let M be a graded manifold and E be a graded vector bundle over M. We say a K-linear map
 : X(M) K  E   E of degree 0 is a linear connection on E over M if the following axioms are satisfied:

(1) C(M)-linear in the first argument: fX s = f X s. (2) X is a derivative in the second argument: X (f s) = X(f )s + (-1)|f|·|X|f X s,

where f  C(M) and X  X(M) are homogeneous elements, and s   E .

The covariant derivative associated to a linear connection  is the K-linear map d :  p TM   E   p+1 TM   E
of (internal) degree 0, defined by

p+1
d (X1  · · ·  Xp+1) =  (-1)i+1(Xi)(X1  · · ·  Xi  · · ·  Xp+1)
i=1
+  (-1)i+j([Xi, Xj]  X1  · · ·  Xi  · · ·  Xj  · · ·  Xp+1),
i<j
for all homogeneous    pTM  E and X1, · · · , Xp+1  X(M). The symbol  = (, X1, · · · , Xp+1) denotes the Koszul signs arising from the reordering of the homogeneous objects , X1, · · · , Xp+1 in each term of the right hand side.

We say  is an affine connection on M if it is a linear connection on TM over M. Given an affine connection  on M, the (1,2)-tensor T    TM   TM   TM of degree 0, defined by
T (X, Y ) = X Y - (-1)|X|·|Y |Y X - [X, Y ]
for any homogeneous vector fields X, Y  X(M), is called the torsion of . We say an affine connection  is torsion-free if T  = 0. It is well known that affine torsion-free connections always exist [31].

The curvature of an affine connection  is the (1,3)-tensor R  2 (M, End(TM)) of degree 0, defined by
R(X, Y )Z = X Y Z - (-1)|X|·|Y |Y X Z - [X,Y ]Z
for any homogeneous vector fields X, Y, Z  X(M).

If the curvature R vanishes identically, the affine connection  is called flat.

Let (M, Q) be a dg manifold. We define an operator Q of degree +1 on the graded C(M)-module

 M; TM   End(TM) :

Q :  M; TM   End(TM) ·   M; TM   End(TM) ·+1

(9)

by the Lie derivative:

(QF )(X, Y ) = [Q, F (X, Y )] - (-1)kF ([Q, X], Y ) - (-1)k+|X|F (X, [Q, Y ])

for any section F   M; TM  End(TM) k of degree k and homogeneous vector fields X, Y  X(M). One can easily check that Q2 = 0. Therefore
 M; TM   End(TM) ·, Q is a cochain complex.
Now given an affine connection , consider the (1, 2)-tensor At(M,Q)   M; TM   End(TM) of degree +1, defined by
At(M,Q)(X, Y ) = [Q, X Y ] - [Q,X]Y - (-1)|X|X [Q, Y ]
for any homogeneous vector fields X, Y  X(M).

Proposition 2.5 ([37]). In the above setting, the following statements hold.

(1) If the affine connection  on M is torsion-free, then At(M,Q)   M; S2(TM  )  TM . In

other words,

At(M,Q)(X, Y ) = (-1)|X|·|Y | At(M,Q)(Y, X).

(2) The element At(M,Q)   M; TM   End(TM) 1 is a 1-cocycle.

(3) The cohomology class [At(M,Q)] does not depend on the choice of connection.

The element At(M,Q) is called the Atiyah cocycle associated to the affine connection . The cohomology class (M,Q) := [At(M,Q)]  H1  M; TM   End(TM) ·, Q is called the Atiyah class of the dg manifold (M, Q) [37]. See also [47] and [33, Footnote 6].

3. Formal exponential map of dg manifolds 3.1. dg coalgebras.

3.1.1. dg coalgebras. Let R be a graded commutative ring. A graded coalgebra C over R is a graded R-module, equipped with an R-linear map  : C  C R C of degree 0, called comultiplication satisfying the following conditions:

(1) (Coassociativity)

(  idC )   = (idC )   : C  C R C R C. (2) (Counit) There is an R-linear map : C  R of graded 0 such that

(  id)   = (id  )   = idC .

Let tw : C R C  C R C be the map defined by tw(c1  c2) = (-1)|c1|·|c2|c2  c1,
for homogeneous elements c1, c2  C. A graded coalgebra C is called cocommutative if it satisfies  = tw .

An R-linear map  : C  C is called an R-coderivation if it satisfies

   = (idC  +   idC)  ,
as R-linear maps C  C R C. We denote the collection of all R-coderivations of C by coDerR(C, C).

Let (R, dR) be a dg commutative ring, and (C, dC) be a dg (R, dR)-module. Then the map

dC2 : C R C  C R C

(11)

DG MANIFOLDS, FORMAL EXPONENTIAL MAPS AND HOMOTOPY LIE ALGEBRAS

10

defined by dC2 (c1  c2) = dC (c1)  c2 + (-1)|c1|c1  dC (c2)
for homogeneous elements c1, c2  C, is a well-defined degree +1 differential. Such a differential is called the induced differential on C R C.
Definition 3.1. Let (R, dR) be a dg commutative ring. A dg coalgebra (C, dC) over (R, dR) is a dg (R, dR)-module (C, dC), equipped with a graded coalgebra structure on C over R where the comultiplication and the counit map respect the differentials. That is,
  dC = dC2  ,  dC = dR 
where  : C  C R C is the comultiplication and : C  R is the counit map.

3.1.2. dg coalgebras associated to dg manifolds. To any dg manifold (M, Q), there associate two dg coalgebras D(M) and  S(TM) over the dg ring (C(M), Q). Below we will briefly describe these dg coalgebra structures. In the sequel, we will always identify (R, dR) = (C(M), Q).
First, let us consider the dg coalgebra structure on the space of differential operators D(M) on M.

The comultiplication

 : D(M)  D(M) R D(M)

(12)

is defined by

(D)(f  g) = D(f · g),

where f, g  C(M) and D  D(M).

The differential LDQ : D(M)  D(M) is defined as the commutator with Q, which is also the Lie

derivative:

LDQ(D) = Q, D = Q · D - (-1)|D|D · Q

(13)

for any D  D(M), where -, - denotes the commutator on D(M).

The induced differential on D(M) R D(M) is again the Lie derivative LQ, which coincides with Q, - , with -, - being the Gerstenhaber bracket on polydifferential operators on M.

The counit map

: D(M)  C(M)

(14)

is the canonical projection, which evaluates a differential operator D on the constant function 1.

Note that D(M) admits a natural ascending filtration by the order of differential operators C(M) = D0(M)  · · ·  Dn(M)  · · ·
where Dn(M) denotes the space of differential operators of order  n. The following proposition can be easily verified.

Proposition 3.2. For any dg manifold (M, Q), the space of differential operators D(M) on M, equipped with the comultiplication , the differential LDQ and the counit as in (12), (13) and (14), is a filtered dg cocommutative coalgebra over (C(M), Q).

Next we describe the dg coalgebra structure on the space  S(TM) .

The comultiplication

 :  S(TM)   S(TM) R  S(TM)

DG MANIFOLDS, FORMAL EXPONENTIAL MAPS AND HOMOTOPY LIE ALGEBRAS

11

is given by

(X1 · · · Xn) = 1  (X1 · · · Xn) + (X1 · · · Xn)  1

n-1

+

 · (X(1) · · · X(k))  (X(k+1) · · · X(n))

k=1 Skn-k

(15)

where X1, · · · , Xn   TM . The symbol  = (X1, X2, · · · , Xn) denotes the Koszul signs arising from the reordering of the homogeneous objects X1, X2, · · · , Xn in each term of the right hand side.

The differential

LQ :  S(TM)   S(TM)

(16)

is the Lie derivative w.r.t. the homological vector field Q. It is easy to see that the induced differential on  S(TM) R  S(TM) =  S(TM)  S(TM) is again the Lie derivative LQ.

The counit map

:  S(TM)  C(M)

(17)

is the canonical projection.

Note that  S(TM) admits a canonical ascending filtration C(M) =  S0(TM)  · · ·   Sn(TM)  · · · .
The following proposition is easily verified.

Proposition 3.3. For any dg manifold (M, Q), the space  S(TM) , equipped with the comulti-
plication , the differential LQ and the counit map as in (15), (16) and (17), is a filtered dg cocommutative coalgebra over (C(M), Q).

3.2. Formal exponential map of a dg manifold. Let M be a finite dimensional graded manifold and  be an affine connection on M. A purely algebraic description of the Poincar´e­Birkhoff­Witt map has been extended to the context of Z-graded manifolds by Liao­Sti´enon [31]. As pointed out in Introduction, for an ordinary smooth manifold, a PBW map is a formal exponential map. In the same way, one can think of the PBW map of a Z-graded manifold as an induced formal exponential map of `the virtual exponential map'

exp : TM  M × M

(18)

by taking fiberwise -jets.

Recall that the Poincar´e­Birkhoff­Witt map

pbw :  S(TM)  D(M)

(19)

is defined by the inductive formula [31]:

pbw(f ) = f, f  C(M); (20)
pbw(X) = X, X  X(M);

and

pbw(X1

1 Xn) = n

where X = X1 · · · Xn   Sn(TM) for homogeneous vector fields X1, · · · , Xn  X(M) and

k = (-1)|Xk|(|X1|+···+|Xk-1|) is the Koszul sign.

Theorem 3.4 ([31]). The map pbw is an isomorphism of graded coalgebras from  S(TM) to D(M) over C(M).

DG MANIFOLDS, FORMAL EXPONENTIAL MAPS AND HOMOTOPY LIE ALGEBRAS

12

Now we move to `formal exponential map' of a dg manifold. Let (M, Q) be a dg manifold. Then, both (S(TM)) and D(M) in (19) are dg coalgebras over (C(M), Q), according to Propositions 3.2 and 3.3. Moreover  S(TM) , LQ can be considered as fiberwise dg-distributions on the dg vector bundle  : TM  M with support the zero section, where TM is equipped with the complete lift homological vector field Q^ [37, 49], while D(M), LDQ can be identified with fiberwise dg-distributions on the dg fiber bundle pr1 : M × M  M with support the diagonal , where the homological vector field on M × M is (Q, Q). On the level of fiberwise -jets, the fact that the virtual exponential map (18) is a map of dg manifolds is equivalent to the map pbw :  S(TM) , LQ  D(M), LDQ being an isomorphism of dg coalgebras over (C(M), Q). This consideration leads to the following
Theorem 3.5. Let (M, Q) be a dg manifold. The Atiyah class (M,Q) vanishes if and only if there exists a torsion-free affine connection  on M such that
pbw :  S(TM) , LQ  D(M), LDQ
is an isomorphism of dg coalgebras over (C(M), Q).
Remark 3.6. A similar theorem in the same spirit concerning the Atiyah class of Lie pairs was obtained in [30, Theorem 5.10]. It would be interesting to establish a result that encompasses both [30, Theorem 5.10] and Theorem 3.5 under a unified framework.

In order to prove Theorem 3.5, we first introduce a linear map

C :  S(TM)  D(M)

by

C := LDQ  pbw - pbw LQ.

(22)

One can easily check that C is an R-linear map of degree +1. Moreover, for n  0,

C  Sn(TM)  Dn-1(M).

The following proposition indicates that C can be completely determined by a recursive formula.

Proposition 3.7. Let (M, Q) be a dg manifold, and  a torsion-free affine connection on M. Then the map C satisfies the following conditions:

C(f ) = 0;

(23)

C(X) = 0;

(24)

C(X Y ) = - At(M,Q)(X, Y ),

(25)

for all f  C(M), X, Y  X(M), and, for n  3, it satisfies the following recursive formula:

C(X) = 1 n

where X = X1 · · · Xn   Sn(TM) with X1, · · · , Xn  X(M) being homogeneous vector fields, X{k} = X1 · · · Xk · · · Xn for any 1  k  n, and k = (-1)|Xk|(|X1|+···+|Xk-1|) is the Koszul sign.

We now prove Theorem 3.5 based on Proposition 3.7.

Proof of Theorem 3.5. Observe that according to Proposition 2.5, we have that (M,Q) = 0 if and only if there exists an affine connection  such that At(M,Q) = 0. Thus, it suffices to prove that C = 0 if and only if At(M,Q) = 0.

DG MANIFOLDS, FORMAL EXPONENTIAL MAPS AND HOMOTOPY LIE ALGEBRAS

13

Assume that C = 0. By Proposition 3.7, we have

C(X Y ) = - At(M,Q)(X, Y ) = 0

for all X, Y  X(M).

Conversely, assume that At(M,Q) = 0. Then we have C(X Y ) = 0 by Proposition 3.7. Hence C(Y ) = 0 for all Y   S2(TM) . Moreover, Equation (26) can be written as

C(X) = 1 n

Therefore, C = 0 by inductive argument.

3.3. Proof of Proposition 3.7. Now we turn to the proof of Proposition 3.7. We will divide the proof into several lemmas.
Lemma 3.8. Under the same hypothesis as in Proposition 3.7, Equations (23), (24) and (25) hold.

Proof. Equations (23) and (24) follow immediately from Equation (20).

To prove Equation (25), let X, Y  X(M) be homogeneous vector fields. Since  is torsion-free, we

have

[X, Y ] = X Y - (-1)|X|·|Y |Y X.

Then, together with Equation (21), we have

pbw(X Y ) = XY - X Y.

Thus, and

LDQ  pbw(X Y ) = [Q, X]Y + (-1)|X|X[Q, Y ] - [Q, X Y ],

pbw LQ(X Y ) = pbw [Q, X] Y + (-1)|X|X [Q, Y ]

As a result, we have C  (X

= [Q, X]Y - [Q,X]Y + (-1)|X| (X[Q, Y ] - X [Q, Y ]) . Y ) = (LDQ  pbw - pbw LQ)(X Y )

= - [Q, X Y ] - [Q,X]Y - (-1)|X|X [Q, Y ]

= - At(M,Q)(X, Y ).

In the sequel, we adopt the following notations. For any X = X1 · · · Xn   Sn(TM) , we
write X{k} = X1 · · · Xk · · · Xn; for i = j, we write X{i,j} = X1 · · · Xi · · · Xj · · · Xn, and for all 1  i  n, X{i,i} = 0.

Lemma 3.9. Under the same hypothesis as in Proposition 3.7, for all X = X1 · · · Xn   Sn(TM) with n  3, we have

Proof. The formula for LDQ  pbw(X) is immediate from Equation (21).

Next, we will compute pbw LQ(X). Since LQ(X) =

4. Atiyah class and homotopy Lie algebras
This section is devoted to the study of homotopy Lie algebras associated to the Atiyah class of dg manifolds.

4.1. Kapranov L[1] algebras of dg manifolds. The Atiyah class of a holomorphic vector bundle is closely related to L[1] algebras as shown by the pioneer work of Kapranov [24, 41, 42]. These L[1] algebras play an important role in derived geometry [10, 35, 41] and construction of Rozansky­Witten invariants [24, 26, 42, 51].

In this section, following Kapranov [24], we show that the Atiyah class of a dg manifold is related to L[1] algebras in a similar fashion. We refer to [16, Sections 4 and 5] for the interpretation in terms of derived category.

Let (M, Q) be a dg manifold and let  be an affine connection on M. The Lie derivative LDQ along the homological vector field Q is a degree +1 coderivation of the dg coalgebra D(M) over (R, dR) according to Proposition 3.2.

Transferring LDQ from D(M) to  S(TM) by the graded coalgebra isomorphism pbw (19), we obtain a degree +1 coderivation  of  S(TM) :

 := (pbw)-1  LDQ  pbw .

(34)

Therefore

 S(TM) , 

(35)

is a dg coalgebra over the dg ring (R, dR).

Finally, dualizing  over (R, dR), we obtain a degree +1 derivation:

D :  S(TM  )   S(TM  )

(36)

Here we used the identification  S(TM  ) = HomR( S(TM) , R).

The following theorem was first announced in [37], but a proof was omitted. We will present a

complete proof below.

Theorem 4.1. Let (M, Q) be a dg manifold, and let  be a torsion-free affine connection on M.

(i) The operator D is a derivation of degree +1 of the graded algebra  S(TM  ) satisfying (D)2 = 0. Thus  S(TM  ) , D is a dg algebra.
(ii) There exists a sequence of degree +1 sections Rk   Sk(TM  )  TM , k 2 whose first term R2 equals to - At(M,Q), such that

D = LQ + Rk,
k=2
where each Rk :  S(TM  )   S(TM  ) denotes the R-linear degree +1 derivation corresponding to Rk. (iii) Different choices of torsion-free affine connections  induce isomorphic dg algebras  S(TM  ) , D .

DG MANIFOLDS, FORMAL EXPONENTIAL MAPS AND HOMOTOPY LIE ALGEBRAS

17

Remark 4.2. The graded algebra  S(TM  ) can be thought of as the graded algebra of functions on a graded manifold TM with support M and D as a homological vector field on TM. Note that
TM and TM are different graded manifolds: the support of TM is TM while the support of TM is M.

Before we prove this theorem, we need to recall some basic notations.

Recall that given a graded commutative algebra R and a graded R-module V , the symmetric tensor algebra (SR(V ), µ) over R admits a canonical graded coalgebra structure  : SR(V )  SR(V ) R SR(V ) defined by [30]

(v1 · · · vn) = 1  (v1 · · · vn) + (v1 · · · vn)  1

n-1

+

 (v(1) · · · v(k))  (v(k+1) · · · v(n))

k=1 Skn-k

for homogeneous elements v1, · · · , vn  V . Here the symbol  = (v1, v2, · · · , vn) denotes the Koszul signs arising from the reordering of the homogeneous objects v1, v2, · · · , vn in each term of the right hand side.

The following lemma is standard-- see, for example, [34, 30].

Lemma 4.3. Let R be a graded commutative algebra and V be an R-module. There is a natural
isomorphism

coDerR(SR(V ), SR(V )) - HomR(SRk (V ), V )
k=0
as R-modules.

More explicitly, the correspondence between a sequence of maps {qk}k0 with qk  HomR(SRk (V ), V ) and a coderivation Q  coDerR(SR(V ), SR(V )) is given by
Q(v1 · · · vn) = q0(1) v1 · · · vn + qn(v1 · · · vn) 1

n-1

+

 qk(v(1) · · · v(k)) v(k+1) · · · v(n)

k=1 Skn-k

for homogeneous vectors v1, · · · , vn  V .

(37)

For a given graded R-coalgebra (C, ) and a graded R-algebra (A, µ), the convolution product on the graded vector space HomR(C, A) is defined by

f g = µ  (f  g)  

f, g  HomR(C, A). It is clear that (HomR(C, A), ) is a graded R-algebra. In particular, since SR(V ) is both a graded coalgebra and a graded algebra, the space of R-linear maps HomR (SR(V ), SR(V )) admits a convolution product:

(f g)(v) = (-1)|g|·|v(1)|f (v(1)) g(v(2)),

(38)

(v)

where v  SR(V ) and (v) = v(1)  v(2).
(v)

Using the above notation (38), we may write Equation (37) as



Q=

q¯k idSR(V ) ,

k=0

(39)

DG MANIFOLDS, FORMAL EXPONENTIAL MAPS AND HOMOTOPY LIE ALGEBRAS

18

where the map q¯k : SR(V )  SR(V ) is defined by the following commutative diagram:

SR(V ) q¯k SR(V )

prk

(40)

SRk (V ) qk SR1 (V ).

Here prk : SR(V )  SRk (V ) denotes the canonical projection. We write id for idSR(V ) below if there is no confusion. We are now ready to give a detailed proof of Theorem 4.1.

Proof of Theorem 4.1. For (i), by construction, it is clear that the operator D in (36) is indeed a degree +1 derivation. Since Q is a homological vector field, from (34), it follows that ()2 = 0. Therefore (D)2 = 0.

To prove (ii), consider the case when R = C(M) and V =  TM in Lemma 4.3. Recall that C in (22) is R-linear, and pbw :  S(TM)  D(M) is an isomorphism of graded coalgebras over R. Since LQ  coDerR( S(TM) ) and LDQ  coDerR(D(M)), it thus follows

(pbw)-1  C = (pbw)-1  LDQ  pbw -LQ  coDerR( STM ).

Since both LDQ and LQ are of degree +1 and pbw is of degree 0, it follows from Lemma 4.3 and

Equation (39) that there exists a sequence of degree +1 sections Rk   Sk(TM  )  TM , k 0,

such that


(pbw)-1  LDQ  pbw -LQ = (R¯k id).

(41)

k=0
Here we think of Rk as an R-linear map Rk :  Sk(TM)   TM and R¯k :  S(TM)   S(TM) defined as in Diagram (40).

From Equations (23), (24) and (25), it follows that

R0 = 0, R1 = 0, and R2 = - At(M,Q) .

(42)

Thus the conclusion follows immediately from (41) by taking its R-dual.

Finally, assume that  is another torsion-free affine connection. Let  := (pbw )-1  pbw. Then

from Proposition 3.2, Proposition 3.3 and Theorem 3.4, it follows that

 :  S(TM) ,  -=  S(TM) , 

(43)

is an isomorphism of dg coalgebras over (C(M), Q). By dualizing it over the dg algebra (C(M), Q), we have that

T :  S(TM  ) , D -=  S(TM  ) , D

(44)

is an isomorphism of dg algebras over (C(M), Q). This concludes the proof of the theorem.

Indeed, following Kapranov [24], one may consider  S(TM  ) , D as the `dg algebra of functions' on the `formal neighborhood' of the diagonal  of the product dg manifold M × M, (Q, Q) : the PBW map pbw is, by construction, a formal exponential map identifying a neighborhood of the zero section of TM to a `formal neighborhood' of the diagonal of M × M as Z-graded manifolds and Equation (34) asserts that D is the homological vector field obtained on TM by pullback of the vector field (Q, Q) on M × M through this formal exponential map. The readers are invited to compare Theorem 4.1 with [24, Theorem 2.8.2].
As an immediate consequence, we are ready to prove the main result of this section.

DG MANIFOLDS, FORMAL EXPONENTIAL MAPS AND HOMOTOPY LIE ALGEBRAS

Theorem 4.4. Let (M, Q) be a dg manifold. Each choice of an affine connection  on M determines an L[1] algebra structure on the space of vector fields X(M). While the unary bracket 1 : S1 X(M)  X(M) is the Lie derivative LQ along the homological vector field, the higher multibrackets k : Sk X(M)  X(M), with k  2, arise as the composition
k : Sk X(M)   Sk(TM) -R-k X(M)
induced by a family of sections {Rk}k2 of the vector bundles Sk(TM  )  TM starting with R2 = - At(M,Q).
Furthermore, the L[1] algebra structures on X(M) arising from different choices of connections are all canonically isomorphic.

For clarity, we point out that Sk X(M) denotes the symmetric tensor product over the field K of
k copies of X(M). Note that the multibrackets k are C(M)-multilinear for all k  2, while 1 is a morphism of dg modules over the dg algebra (C(M), Q).

Proof. The first part follows immediately from the fact that  S(TM) ,  as in (35) is a dg coalgebra over (C(M), Q).
The uniqueness is a direct consequence of Theorem 4.1 as well. Indeed, it is easier to derive it using the dg coalgebra  S(TM) ,  as in (35). If  is another torsion-free affine connection on M, we know that  :  S(TM) ,  -=  S(TM) ,  as in (43) is an isomorphism of dg coalgebras over the (C(M), Q). Thus it follows that the sequence of maps {k}k1 defined by the composition
k : Sk (X(M))   Sk(TM) -  S(TM) -p-r1  TM = X(M)
is an isomorphism of L[1] algebras. Indeed, from (20) and (21), it is simple to see that the linear term 1 is the identity map.

Such an L[1] algebra on X(M) is called the Kapranov L[1] algebra of the dg manifold (M, Q).

4.2. Recursive formula for multibrackets. It is clear that the Kapranov L[1] algebra of a dg manifold in Theorem 4.4 is completely determined by the Atiyah 1-cocycle and
Rk   Sk(TM  )  TM =  Hom(Sk(TM), TM) for k  3.
Recall that, for the L[1] algebra on the Dolbeault complex 0,·(TX1,0) associated to the Atiyah class of the tangent bundle TX of a K¨ahler manifold X, Kapranov showed that the multibrackets can be described explicitly by a very simple formula: (7). For a general complex manifold, it was proved in [30] that they can be computed recursively as well. It is thus natural to ask if one can describe the multibrackets in Theorem 4.4 explicitly.
In what follows, we will give a characterization of these multibrackets, or equivalently all terms Rk, k  2, by showing that they are completely determined by the Atiyah cocycle At(M,Q), the curvature R, and their higher covariant derivatives, by a recursive formula.
We need to introduce some notations first.

Lemma 4.5. The map B is well defined and R-linear. Hence B is indeed a bundle map B : TM  S(TM)  S(TM).

As we will see below, the map B is completely determined by the curvature R and it higher covariant derivatives.

homogeneous objects 1, 2, · · · , p, X1, X2, · · · , Xp in each term of the right hand side.

The following is an immediate consequence of the Fedosov construction of graded manifolds [31, Theorem 5.6 and Proposition 5.2]. A short description on this topic can be found in Appendix A.

Lemma 4.6.

(i) The bundle map B : TM  S(TM)  S(TM) in Lemma 4.5 is completely determined by the curvature R and its higher covariant derivatives. In fact, given any Y  X(M),
one can compute B(Y ; X) for X   Sn(TM) , provided that B(Y ; Y ) is known for all Y   Sn-1(TM) . (ii) Moreover, if R = 0, then B(Y ; X) = Y X, for any Y  X(M) and X   S(TM) .

Proof. (i). Let Then by Equation (46),

Y X = (pbw)-1(Y · pbw(X)). B(Y ; X) = Y X - Y X.

DG MANIFOLDS, FORMAL EXPONENTIAL MAPS AND HOMOTOPY LIE ALGEBRAS

21

For the rest of the proof, we follow the notation from Appendix A, in particular, Theorem A.4. We have
 Y X - Y X = (-1)||·|Y | Y  - Y  X
= (-1)||·|Y | iY (d - d )() X

= (-1)||·|Y | iY ( - A)() X

= |Y X - (-1)||·|Y | iY A() X

= |Y X -  (iY A)T X .

Thus it follows that

B(Y ; X) = Y X - (iY A)T X.

The conclusion thus follows from Corollary A.7.

(ii) Moreover, if R = 0, then A = 0 by Equation (90), and hence we obtain B(Y ; X) = Y X.

Theorem 4.7.

Now we proceed to prove Theorem 4.7. For any X   Sn(TM) , we can write

n

= pbw

(R¯k id)(X)

k=0

n

= pbw (R¯k id)(X).

(48)

In order to simplify the notation, we also introduce the map Bk :  S(TM)   S(TM) for

k  2, by

Bk(X) = B  (R¯k  id)  (X), X   Sn(TM) .

(49)

DG MANIFOLDS, FORMAL EXPONENTIAL MAPS AND HOMOTOPY LIE ALGEBRAS

22

Explicitly, in terms of Sweedler's notation X = X(1)  X(2), we write

Bk(X) = B(Rk(X(1)); X(2))

= (pbw)-1 Rk(X(1)) · pbw(X(2)) - Rk(X(1))X(2).

(50)

From Lemma 4.5, it follows that Bk, with k  2, is R-linear. That is, Bk, with k  2, is indeed a bundle map S(TM)  S(TM).

Proof of Theorem 4.7. (i) First, we will prove the recursive formula (47).

Again, for the sake of simplicity, we use Sweedler's notation X = X(1)  X(2) and the Koszul sign k = (-1)|Xk|(|X1|+···+|Xk-1|).

For each l, by Equation (21) and (38), we have

(n - l + 1) pbw (R¯l id)(X) = (n - l + 1) pbw(Rl(X(1)) X(2))

= Rl(X(1)) · pbw(X(2)) - pbw Rl(X(1))X(2)

Combining it with Equation (50), we conclude that

n
= k(-1)|Xk| Xk · pbw (R¯l id)(X{k}) - pbw Xk (R¯l id)(X{k})

Therefore,

From (42), we know that R2 = - At(M,Q). According to Lemma 4.6, the bundle map B is completely determined by the curvature R and its higher covariant derivatives. It thus follows
from the recursive formula (47) that, for any n  3, Rn is determined by Rk with k  n - 1, their covariant derivatives and the curvature. Thus, by inductive argument, Rn is completely determined by the Atiyah cocycle, the curvature and their higher covariant derivatives.

This concludes the proof of the theorem.

5. Examples
This section is devoted to the study of examples of Kapranov L[1] algebras of some standard dg manifolds including those corresponding to L[1] algebras, foliations and complex manifolds as in Examples 2.2 and 2.3.

5.1. dg manifolds associated to L[1] algebras. Let g be a finite dimensional L algebra with d = dim g. Then g[1] is an L[1] algebra. Equivalently, the (canonical) symmetric coalgebra
(S(g[1]), ) is equipped with a coderivation Q  coDer(S(g[1])) of degree +1 satisfying Q  Q = 0. Indeed, Q is equivalent to a sequence of linear maps qk : Sk(g[1])  g[1], k  1, of degree +1, called the k-th multibracket, satisfying the generalized Jacobi identities.

Given an L[1] algebra g[1], we say a vector space M is a g[1]-module if there exists a sequence of maps k : Sk(g[1])  M  M of degree +1, k  0, satisfying the standard compatibility condition
[28]. If we write

 = k : S(g[1])  M  M,

(58)

k
the compatibility condition is explicitly expressed as

  (idS(g[1]) )  (  idM) + Q  idM = 0.

As an obvious example, we have the trivial module: M = K together with the trivial action: k = 0 for all k  0. Another example is the adjoint module: M = g[1] with the adjoint action

DG MANIFOLDS, FORMAL EXPONENTIAL MAPS AND HOMOTOPY LIE ALGEBRAS

25

k : Sk(g[1])  g[1]  g[1] defined by

k(X  X) = qk+1(X X),

(59)

where X  Sk(g[1]), X  g[1] and qk+1 : Sk+1(g[1])  g[1] is the multibracket of the L[1] algebra g[1]. That is, {k}k0 is defined by the following commutative diagram

Sk(g[1])  g[1]

k

g[1]

sym

qk+1

Sk+1(g[1])
where sym : S·(g[1])  g[1]  S·+1(g[1]) is the canonical symmetrization map. By taking its dual, (g[1]) is also a g[1]-module, where the action is called the coadjoint action.

Throughout this section, we denote the degree of a homogeneous element x  g[1] by |x|. In particular, if g is a Lie algebra concentrated at degree 0, then for any x  g[1], its degree is |x| = -1.

The associated Chevalley­Eilenberg cochain complex of a g[1]-module M is

C(g[1]; M) = Hom S(g[1]), M , dM CE ,

where dM CE is defined by

dM CE(F ) =   (id F )   - (-1)|F |F  Q,

(60)

for any homogeneous element F  Hom S(g[1]), M .

Observe that when M is the trivial module K, the associated Chevalley­Eilenberg cochain complex

C(g[1]; K) = Hom S(g[1]), K , dKCE = dCE

is a dg algebra, equipped with multiplication

f g = µK  (f  g)   : S(g[1])  K

(61)

for any f, g  Hom(S(g[1]), K). In other words, the dg algebra (C(g[1]), Q) coincides with

the Chevalley­Eilenberg cochain complex C(g[1]; K), dCE of the trivial g[1]-module K. That is,

C(g[1]; K), dCE is the dg algebra dual to the dg coalgebra (S(g[1]), Q). Moreover, for any g[1]-

module algebra

M, the Chevalley­Eilenberg cochain complex C(g[1]; M), dM CE (C(g[1]), Q), where the action, under the identification µ0 : K

is 

a dg module over the M = M, is given by

dg

f · F = µ0  (f  F )   : S(g[1])  M

(62)

for any f  Hom(S(g[1]), K) and F  Hom(S(g[1]), M). In particular, this means that it satisfies the compatibility condition

dM CE(f · F ) = dCE(f ) · F + (-1)|f|f · dM CE(F ).

(63)

Therefore, the Chevalley­Eilenberg differential dM CE is completely determined by its image of elements in M, which essentially is induced by the action (58). More precisely, for any x  M,

dM CE(x) = k(-, x)  Hom(S(g[1]), M) = S(g[1])  M.

k

In particular, for the L[1] algebra adjoint module g[1] described above, the Chevalley­Eilenberg differential is given by

where {e1, · · · , ed} is a basis of g[1] and {1, · · · , d} its dual basis of (g[1]).

Remark 5.1. In terms of Sweedler's notation, we may write (61) as

(f g)(X) = (-1)|g|·|X(1)|f (X(1))g(X(2))
(X )

and (62) as

(f · F )(X) = (-1)|F |·|X(1)|f (X(1))F (X(2)),

(X )

where f, g  Hom(S(g[1]), K), F  Hom(S(g[1]), M), X  S(g[1]) are homogeneous and
X = X(1)  X(2).
(X )

We now proceed to describe the Kapranov L[1] algebra of the dg manifold (g[1], dCE). Recall that

Q = dCE is defined by

Q(f ) = dCE(f ) = -(-1)|f|f  Q

(65)

for any homogeneous element f  Hom(S(g[1]), K) = C(g[1]).

Let {e1, · · · , ed} be a basis of g[1] and {x1, · · · , xd} its induced coordinate functions on g[1] satisfying

xi(ej) = xi ej =

1 0

if i = j if i = j

.

We also use the notation

 xj

xi

:=

(-1)|xi |·|xj |

xi ej

.

(66)

Lemma 5.2. Under the above notation, write the multibrackets as

qk(ei1 , · · · , eik ) = cji1,··· ,ik ej , k  1.

Then the homological vector field Q  X(g[1]) can be written as

Q=-



1 k!

cji1···ik

(67)

Here, we used Einstein summation convention.

Proof.

As

field,

Q

can

as

for some Qj

 C(g[1]).

Then, as a

derivation of C(g[1]), Q satisfies Q(xj) = (-1)|xj|Qj according to (66). On the other hand, by

(65),

Q(xj) ei1 · · · eik = -(-1)|xj| xj Q(ei1 · · · eik )

for any k  1.

= -(-1)|xj|cji1···ik .

Therefore, we may conclude that

Qj = -

and this completes the proof.

Note that we have a canonical trivialization of the tangent bundle

Tg[1] = g[1] × g[1].

(68)

DG MANIFOLDS, FORMAL EXPONENTIAL MAPS AND HOMOTOPY LIE ALGEBRAS

27

Hence, we have the following identification

C(g[1])  g[1] X(g[1])  Hom (S(g[1]), g[1])

 f  ei  f xi



X  (-1)|ei|·|X| f |X

(69)

where f  Hom(S(g[1]), K) = C(g[1]) is homogeneous and X  S(g[1]).

Lemma 5.3. Under the identification (69), the Lie derivative LQ = [Q, -]  End(X(g[1])) corresponds to the Chevalley­Eilenberg differential dgC[E1], where g[1] acts on g[1] by adjoint action.

Proof. Recall that the Chevalley­Eilenberg differential dgC[E1] on g[1] satisfies (63). On the other hand, we have

LQ(f · F ) = [Q, f · F ] = Q(f ) · F + (-1)|f|f · [Q, F ] = Q(f ) · F + (-1)|f|f · LQ(F ),

for any homogeneous element f  C(g[1]) = Hom(S(g[1]), K) and F  X(g[1]) = Hom(S(g[1]), g[1]).

The conclusion thus follows immediately by comparing the equation above with (64).

The trivialization of the tangent bundle (68) induces an isomorphism Tg[1]  End(Tg[1]) -= g[1] × (g[1])  (g[1])  g[1]
of vector bundles. Lemma 5.3, comparing with (9), indicates that we have an isomorphism of cochain complexes:

 g[1]; Tg[1]  End(Tg[1]) ·, Q -= Hom·(S(g[1]), M), dM CE .

(70)

where M = (g[1])  (g[1])  g[1] is the (co)adjoint module.

Thus we have the following

Corollary 5.4. Let (M, Q) = (g[1], dCE) be the dg manifold corresponding to a finite-dimensional L[1] algebra g[1]. There is a canonical isomorphism, for any k  Z,
Hk (Tg[1]  End(Tg[1]))·, Q = HCkE(g[1], (g[1])  (g[1])  g[1])
where the right hand side stands for the Chevalley­Eilenberg cohomology of the L[1] algebra g[1] valued in (g[1])  (g[1])  g[1].

Remark 5.5. It is sometimes useful to use the Chevalley­Eilenberg cohomology of L algebra rather than L[1] algebra. Then Corollary 5.4 can be rephrased as follows.

DG MANIFOLDS, FORMAL EXPONENTIAL MAPS AND HOMOTOPY LIE ALGEBRAS

28

For any finite-dimensional L algebra g, there is a canonical isomorphism, for any k  Z, Hk (Tg[1]  End(Tg[1]))·, Q = HCk-E1(g, g  g  g),
where the right hand side stands for the Chevalley­Eilenberg cohomology of the L algebra g valued in g  g  g. Note that there is a degree shifting here.

Equation (72) implies that At(g[1],Q)(ei, ej ) : el1 · · · elk  -qk+2(ei ej el1 · · · elk ).

Therefore, under the identification above, we have

At(g[1],Q)(x, y) : X  -qn+2(x y X), for any x, y  g[1] and X  Sn(g[1]). Thus, by abuse of notation, we may write
At(g[1],Q) = - qk.

Remark 5.7. We can rephrase Proposition 5.6 in terms of multibrackets of L algebra g instead of L[1] algebra g[1]. For a finite dimensional L algebra g equipped with multibrackets lk : kg  g
of degree 2 - k for k  1, the Atiyah class (g[1],dCE) of the dg manifold (g[1], dCE) is

According to Corollary 4.4, we obtain the following
Proposition 5.8. Let g[1] be a finite dimensional L[1] algebra with multibrackets qk : Sk(g[1])  g[1], k  1. Let (M, Q) = (g[1], dCE) be its corresponding dg manifold. Choose the trivial connection. Then the multibrackets {n}n1 of the Kapranov L[1] algebra structure on Hom (S(g[1]), g[1]) = S(g[1])  g[1], being identified with X(g[1]) as in Equation (69), are given as follows.

(1) The unary bracket 1 coincides with the Chevalley­Eilenberg differential valued in the L[1]adjoint module g[1]:
1 = dgC[E1] : S(g[1])  g[1]  S(g[1])  g[1]
(2) For any n  2, n is S(g[1])-linear in each argument, and therefore can be considered as a linear map n : Sn(g[1])  S(g[1])  g[1] which is completely determined by

n(X) = qk(X -), n  2,
k=n
where X  Sn(g[1]), and each qk(X -) : Sk-n(g[1])  g[1] is defined by Y  qk(X Y ) for all Y  Sk-n(g[1]).

Example 5.9. If g is a Lie algebra, then the Kapranov L algebra (i.e. shifted (-1)-Kapranov L[1]) -algebra of the dg manifold (g[1], dCE) is the dgla g  g, where the differential is the Chevalley­Eilenberg differential dgCE of the g-module g (by adjoint action), and the Lie bracket is [  x,   y] = (-1)|x|·||    [x, y] for homogeneous ,   g and x, y  g.

5.2. dg manifolds associated to complex manifolds and integrable distributions. To any complex manifold X, there associates a dg manifold (TX0,1[1], ¯)--see Example 2.3. This section is

DG MANIFOLDS, FORMAL EXPONENTIAL MAPS AND HOMOTOPY LIE ALGEBRAS

30

devoted to describe its Kapranov L[1] algebra. Recall that for a K¨ahler manifold X, Kapranov obtained an explicit description of an L[1] algebra structure on the Dolbeault complex 0,·(TX1,0), where the unary bracket is the Dolbeault operator and the binary bracket is the Dolbeault cocycle
of the Atiyah class of TX [24, Theorem 2.6]. Kapranov proved the existence of an L[1] algebra
structure associated to the Atiyah class of the holomorphic tangent bundle of any complex manifold
using formal geometry and PROP [24, Theorem 4.3]. See Theorem 5.11 below for the Dolbeault representations. Since TX0,1  TCX is a complex integrable distribution, we will consider general integrable distributions over K. Indeed such L[1] algebra structures can be obtained in a more
general perspective in terms of Lie pairs [30]. We recall its construction briefly below.

Let F  TKM be an integrable distribution. Then (F [1], dF ) is a dg manifold, whose algebra of smooth functions C(F [1], K) is identified with F := (F ) and the homological vector field is the leafwise de Rham differential, i.e. the Chevalley­Eilenberg differential dF : ·F  ·F+1 of the Lie algebroid F . It is well known that the normal bundle B := TKM /F is naturally an F -module,
where the F -action is known as the Bott connection [14], defined by

Ba ottb = prB[a, ~b],

(73)

for all a  (F ), b  (B) and ~b  (TKM ) such that prB(~b) = b. Here prB : TKM  B denotes the canonical projection. Let D(M ) be the space of K-linear differential operators on M , and R = C(M ; K) be the space of K-valued smooth functions on M . Then D(M ) is an R-coalgebra

equipped with the standard coproduct

 : D(M )  D(M ) R D(M ).

(74)

Let D(M )(F )  D(M ) be the left ideal of D(M ) generated by (F ). Since

(D(M )(F ))  D(M ) R D(M )(F ) + D(M )(F ) R D(M ),

the coproduct (74) descends to a well-defined coproduct over R

 : D(B)  D(B) R D(B),

(75)

on the quotient space D(B) :=

D(M ) D(M )(F

)

.

Hence D(B) is an R-coalgebra as well, called the R-

coalgebra of transversal differential operators of F [50].

It is well-known that D(B) is an F -module [30, 29], where the F -action is given by

a · u = a  u,

(76)

for any a  (F ) and u  D(B) which is the projection of u  D(M ). Here  denotes the

composition of differential operators. Moreover, F acts on D(B) by coderivations. Indeed, the

associated Chevalley­Eilenberg differential

dUF : ·F (D(B))  ·F+1(D(B))

(77)

is a coderivation w.r.t. the F -linear coproduct:

 : F (D(B))  F (D(B)) F F (D(B)), extending the coproduct (75) on D(B). Thus (F (D(B)), dUF , ) is a dg coalgebra over (F , dF ).

Let j : B  TKM be a splitting of the short exact sequence of vector bundles over M :

0  F -i TKM -p-rB B  0.

(78)

Choose a torsion-free linear connection B of the vector bundle B, i.e. a TKM -connection on B satisfying the condition:

BX (prB Y ) - BY (prB X) - prB[X, Y ] = 0,

DG MANIFOLDS, FORMAL EXPONENTIAL MAPS AND HOMOTOPY LIE ALGEBRAS

31

for any X, Y   TKM . It is known [30, Lemma 5.2] that a torsion-free linear connection B automatically extends the Bott representation of F on B, that is, Ba X¯ = Ba ottX¯ , a   F and X¯   B .

According to [30, 29], the pair (j, B) determines an isomorphism of R-coalgebras

pbw : (S(B))  D(B),

called the PBW isomorphisms for the Lie pair (TKM , F ), which is defined recursively as follows: pbw(f ) = f, f  R,

pbw(b) = j(b), b  (B),

and

pbw(b1

···

1n bn) = n

j(bk) · pbw(b{k}) - pbw(Bj(bk)(b{k})) ,

k=1

where we keep the notation from (76) and b{k} = b1 · · · bk-1 bk+1 · · · bn. Via an F -linear extension, we obtain an isomorphism of F -coalgebras

pbw : F (S(B))  F (D(B)).

(79)

Transferring dUF from F (D(B)) to F (S(B)) via the isomorphism (79), we obtain a degree +1 coderivation  of F (SB):

 := (pbw)-1  dUF  pbw : ·F (S(B))  ·F+1(S(B)).

(80)

Thus

F (S(B)), , 

(81)

is a dg coalgebra over (F , dF ).

By dualizing  over the dg algebra (F , dF ), we obtain a degree +1 derivation

D : ·F (S(B)) - ·F+1(S(B)).

(82)

According to [30, Theorem 5.7], D in (82) can be expressed as



D

=

dBott
F

+

Rk ,

k=2

where

(1)

dBott
F

(2) for any k  2, Rk : ·F (S(B)) - ·F+1(S(B)) is the ·F -linear degree +1 derivation acting by contraction induced from a section Rk  1F (Sk(B)  B));
(3) R2  1F (S2(B)  B) is the Atiyah 1-cocycle AtTKBMott/F associated with the connection B defined by
R2(a, X¯ ) = Ba BX - BX Ba - B[a,X],

for all a  (F ), X  (TKM ), where X¯   B denotes the projection of X.

A priori, R2  1F (B  End(B)), but the torsion-free assumption guarantees that it is indeed an element in 1F (S2(B)B). Its cohomology class TKM/F  H1CE(F, BEnd(B)) is independent of the choice of B and is called the Atiyah class of the Lie pair (TKM, F ) [14]. Note that F (S(B)) is the algebra of functions on F [1]  B. Thus (F [1]  B, D) is a dg manifold with support M ,
called a Kapranov dg manifold associated to the Lie pair (TKM, F ) [30]. One can prove that the

DG MANIFOLDS, FORMAL EXPONENTIAL MAPS AND HOMOTOPY LIE ALGEBRAS

32

various Kapranov dg manifold structures on F [1]  B resulting from all possible choices of splitting and connection are all isomorphic.

Theorem 5.10 ([30, Theorem 5.7]). Let F  TKM be an integrable distribution. The choice of a splitting j : B  TKM of the short exact sequence (78) and a torsion-free linear connection B of the vector bundle B determines an L[1] algebra structure on the graded vector space ·F (B) defined by a sequence (k)kN of multibrackets such that each k, with k 2, is F -multilinear,
and

·

· the binary bracket 2 is the map

induced by the the Atiyah 1-cocycle R2  1F (S2(B)  B); · for every k 3, the k-th multibracket k is the composition of the wedge product

jF1 (B)  · · ·  jFk (B)  jF1+···+jk Bk

with the map jF1+···+jk Bk  jF1+···+jn+1(B)
induced by an element Rk  1F Sk(B)  B  1F (B)k  B .

Moreover, the L[1] algebra structure ·F (B) is unique up to isomorphisms in the sense that those resulting from all possible choices of splitting and connection are all isomorphic.

Such an L[1] algebra ·F (B) is called Kapranov L[1] algebra of the integrable distribution F .
As a special case, consider a complex manifold X. The subbundle F = TX0,1  TCX is an integrable distribution, and the normal bundle B := TCX/TX0,1 is naturally identified with TX1,0. Moreover, the Chevalley­Eilenberg differential associated with the Bott F -connection on TX1,0 becomes the Dolbeault operator
¯: 0X,·(TX1,0)  X0,·+1(TX1,0).
The following is an immediate consequence of Theorem 5.10, which extends Kapranov's construction for K¨ahler manifolds [24, Theorem 2.6] to all complex manifolds [30].
Theorem 5.11 ([30, Theorem 5.24]). For a given complex manifold X, any torsion-free TX1,0connection 1,0 on TX1,0 determines an L[1] algebra structure on the Dolbeault complex 0,·(TX1,0) such that

· the unary bracket 1 is the Dolbeault operator

 : 0,j (TX1,0)  0,j+1(TX1,0);

· the binary bracket 2 is the map

2 : 0,j1 (TX1,0)  0,j2 (TX1,0)  0,j1+j2+1(TX1,0)
induced by the Dolbeault representative of the Atiyah 1-cocycle R2  0,1 S2(TX1,0)  TX1,0 ; · for every k 3, the k-th multibracket k is the composition of the wedge product

0,j1 (TX1,0)  · · ·  0,jk (TX1,0)  0,j1+···+jk (TX1,0)k

with the map

0,j1+···+jk (TX1,0)k  0,j1+···+jn+1(TX1,0)

Moreover, the L[1] algebra ·F (TX1,0) is unique up to isomorphisms.

Now we are ready to consider the Kapranov L[1] algebra of the dg manifold (F [1], dF ). We introduce the map:

~ : D(F [1])  F (D(B))

(83)

D  ~ (D) := (D),

where  : D(F [1])  F R D(M ) is the pushforward map determined by

~ ~

(F (D(B)), dUF ),

(85)

where the projection ~ is a morphism of F -coalgebras.

Choose a torsion-free affine connection  on F [1]. We write

pbw :  S(TF [1])  D(F [1])

(86)

for its corresponding Poincar´e­Birkhoff­Witt map as in (19).

By conjugating the PBW maps pbw and pbw, respectively, on the left hand side and on the right hand side of (85), we obtain

Corollary 5.13. There exists a contraction of dg F -modules

H

( S(TF [1]) , pbw-1 LDQ  pbw)  (F (S(B)), pbw-1  dUF  pbw),



where the projection  := pbw-1  ~  pbw is a morphism of F -coalgebras.

Theorem 5.14. Let F  TKM be an integrable distribution. Then the F -multilinear maps
{k}k1 as in (87) form a quasi-isomorphism of the Kapranov L[1] algebra X(F [1]) of the dg manifold (F [1], dF ) and the L[1] algebra ·F (B) of the integrable distribution F as in Theorem 5.10.

As an immediate consequence, we have

34

Corollary 5.15. For any complex manifold X, consider its corresponding dg manifold (TX0,1[1], ¯) as in Example 2.3. The Kapranov L[1] algebra X(TX0,1[1]) is quasi-isomorphic to the L[1] algebra 0,·(TX1,0) as in Theorem 5.11, the quasi-isomorphism {k}k1, in which each map k is 0X,·multilinear, is given by (87) (with F = TX0,1 and B = TX1,0), and in particular, the linear part 1 : X(TX0,1[1])  0,·(TX1,0) is given by the composition

X(TX0,1[1]) - 0,·(TXC) -pr 0,·(TX1,0).

Appendix A. Fedosov construction on graded manifolds

This section is to give a brief description of Fedosov construction of graded manifolds. We refer readers to [17, 18, 31] for more details.
Throughout this section, M is a finite dimensional graded manifold and  is a torsion-free affine connection on M. There is an induced linear connection on S(TM  ), which is denoted by the same symbol  by abuse of notation.
Consider the map  : X(M) ×  S(TM)   S(TM) Y X = (pbw)-1 Y · pbw(X)
for any Y  X(M) and X   S(TM) .
Lemma A.1. The above map  defines a flat connection on S(TM).

We write, by abuse of notation, the same symbol  , for the induced flat connection on S(TM  ). Then the associated covariant derivative d satisfies
(d )2 = 0.

In the following, we use the identification
p(S(TM  )) =  p(TM  )  S(TM  ) =  Hom(p(TM)  S(TM), K)
and the total degree of   p(S(TM  )) is p + ||, where p is the cohomological degree and || is the internal degree.

Define two operators and by

 : p(S(TM  ))  p+1(S(TM  )) h : p(S(TM  ))  p-1(S(TM  ))

p+1
() (X1 · · ·Xp+1; Y1 · · · Yq-1) =  (-1)i+1(X1 · · ·Xi · · ·Xp+1; Xi Y1 · · · Yq-1)
i=1
and 1 q+1
(h) (X1  · · ·  Xp-1; Y1 · · · Yq+1) = p + q  · (Yj  X1  · · ·  Xp-1; Y1 · · · Yj · · · Yq+1),
j=1

for all   p(S(TM  )) and all homogeneous X1, · · · , Xp+1, Y1, · · · , Yq+1  X(M). The symbol  denotes the Koszul signs: either (X1, · · · , Xp+1, Y1, · · · , Yq-1) or (X1, · · · , Xp-1, Y1, · · · , Yq+1), as
appropriate.

Both  and h are C(M)-linear, and  is the Koszul operator. Observe that  has the total degree +1 and h has the total degree -1, while both  and  do not change the internal degree. (i.e. || = || and |h| = || for   p(S(TM  )).) Remark A.2. In [17, 18, 31], the operator h is written as -1. We avoid this notation because -1 is not an inverse map of , and it is rather a homotopy operator. Lemma A.3. The operator  satisfies 2 = 0. That is,
0  0(S(TM  )) - 1(S(TM  )) - 2(S(TM  )) - · · · forms a cochain complex. Moreover, it satisfies
  h + h   = id -0 where 0 : ·(S(TM  ))  C(M) is the natural projection.
We have the following theorem
Theorem A.4 ([31, Theorem 5.6]). Let M be a finite dimensional graded manifold and  be a torsion-free affine connection on M. Then the covariant derivative d decomposes as
d = d -  + A,
where the operator A : · S(TM  )  ·+1 S(TM  ) , is a (total) degree +1 derivation determined by A  1 M, S2(TM  )  TM , satisfying
h  A = 0.
Remark A.5. The operator A increases the cohomological degree by +1 while it preserves the internal degree. That is, although the total degree of A is +1, we have the internal degree A = 0.

Write

A = An ,
n2

An  1(M, Sn(TM  )  TM).

Let R  2 M; End(TM) denote the curvature of .

Proposition A.6. We have the following iterative formula for An n  2 A2 = h  R ,

An+1 = h  dAn +

p+q=n

Proof. By Theorem A.4, the covariant derivative d = d -  + A and satisfies (d )2 = 0.

By Lemma A.3, we know 2 = 0 and  h+h = id -0. Also, (d)2 = R. Since  is torsion-free,
we have [, d] =   d + d   = 0.

As a result, (d )2 = 0 implies that

By applying h, we get

  A + A   = R + dA + 1 [A, A] 2

A = h    A = h  R + dA + 1 [A, A] 2

REFERENCES

36

because h  A = 0 and 0  A = 0. Since we have h 2(Sq(TM  ))  1(Sq+1(TM  )), keeping in track with decomposition of A = n2 An , we obtain the following recursive expression
A2 = h  R ,

An+1 = h  dAn +

This completes the proof.

Corollary A.7. Under the same hypothesis as in Theorem A.4, the element An  1(M, Sn(TM  )TM), with n  2, is completely determined by the curvature R and its higher covariant derivatives. In fact, An satisfies the recursive formula (90) involving Ak , with k  n - 1.
