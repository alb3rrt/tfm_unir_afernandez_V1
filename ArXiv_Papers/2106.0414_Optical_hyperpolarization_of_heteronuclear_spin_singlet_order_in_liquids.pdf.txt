The nuclear spin singlet order involving coupled pairs of spins-1/2 may be used to store nuclear spin hyperpolarization in a room temperature liquid for a time much longer than the spin-lattice relaxation time T1. There both are observations of long-lived homonuclear and heteronuclear spinsinglet order. Although hyperpolarized singlet order of the same species are accessible, hyperpolarized heteronuclear spin-singlet order has not been presented yet. Here we show hyperpolarized singlet order is achievable in the sample of 13C-labeled formic acid solution at room temperature by using optically polarized nitrogen vacancy (NV) center spins in nanodiamonds.

I. INTRODUCTION
Singlet order has recently attracted considerable attention both experimentally [1­3] and theoretically [4, 5], because it is long lived [6], silent and accessible on demand. Singlet order has been exploited for hyperpolarisation storage [7, 8] and sensing applications such as sensing ligand binding [9] or as a probe [10] reporting on very slow flow [11] and diffusion [12] over macroscopic length scales.
The existences of long-lived singlet order are demonstrated in homonuclear [13] and heteronuclear spins [14], as well as multiple-spin systems [15]. Hyperpolarized singlet order of the same species are accessible [16­19], one intends to prepare hyperpolarized magnetization by using dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) and then convert it into singlet order. Several approaches are available such as preparing of singlet order in a high magnetic field by using a radiofrequency pulse sequence [17] and applying an audio-frequency pulse sequence in a low magnetic field [18]. In these methods, they may require extra hardware, time-consuming, low temperature and high magnetic field. Moreover, hyperpolarized singlet order is much more smaller than nuclear hyperpolarization, because singlet order is given by p2/3 in which p is the nuclear hyperpolarization [13]. The practical method of DNP in solutions is Overhauser effect [20], however it only works in low magnetic field limit and the reachable polarizations of different nuclear spins will be the same. Therefore the achievable singlet order is also given by p2/3 which could be extremely low.
In this article, we intend to employ nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds to achieve hyperpolarized heteronuclear singlet order in solutions at room temperature. The NV centers are excellent candidates as optically pumped hyperpolarisation agents [21], which allow for over 90% electron spin polarization to be achieved

in less than a microsecond by optical pumping while exhibiting a relaxation time in the millisecond range even at room temperature [22]. We consider a concrete setup consists of the nanodiamonds (NDs) immobilized in the hydrogel inside a flow channel [23]. The spin singlet is formed by a strongly coupled 13C-1H pair in 13C-labeled formic acid (13CHOOH). Formic acid samples are used with mixtures of 13C-labeled formic acid and H2O. The hydroxyl proton can be ignored because two- and threebond couplings between the 13C-1H system and the acidic proton can be neglected due to rapid exchange in protic solvents. Our method includes two procedures, the optical polarization built-up of the spin pairs by using optically pumped nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds with the magnetic field B = 0.36 T and singlet order generation of 13C-1H pairs in formic acid sample when the magnetic field is adiabatic decreased to around  10 mG [24, 25]. Singlet order hyperpolarization could be reachable at room temperature.
II. SPIN POLARIZATION BUILT-UP
Formic acid samples in solutions are pumped into a channel containing a hydrogel polarizing cell with the immobilized nanodiamonds for nuclear spin polarization. The polarization target nuclear spins are coupled 13C-1H pairs in 13C-labeled formic acid (13CHOOH). The Hamiltonian of each pair is approximately described by
HCH = gIC · IH + (nC IC + nH IH ) · B, (1)
where the first term denotes as a mutual scalar coupling g of 13C-1H spin pairs and the second term represents the Zeeman interaction. Note that the scalar coupling g = 220 Hz is much larger than the frequency of chemical shift. nC and nH are gyromagnetic ratios of 13C and 1H nuclear spins, respectively. When a dc magnetic field is applied as B = 0.36 T in the polarizing cell, the eigenstates are product states of the form |C H , |CH , |CH , |CH , the scalar coupling is negligible.

(b) Nuclear spin polarization transfer rate Psi changes with time c, which is defined by Eq. (2). The black solid and red dashed lines represent steady-state polarization of the 1H and 13C nuclear spins, respectively.

The theory of spin polarisation via resonance-inclined transfer [23] is employed to polarize 13C-1H spin pairs in solution. Laser illumination is used for polarizing the NV spins and microwave (MW) irradiation facilitates the polarization transfer to nuclear spin pairs in samples. The steady-state polarization transfer of the nuclear spins is given by

where  = c, c is a characteristic correlation time between the electron and nuclear spins, which could be
adjusted via controlling the mesh sizes and types of hy-
drogels. Thecontinual driving microwave field is given as  =  = 8 2 MHz. Thus as shown in Fig. 1(a), consider c > 10-8s, we have the spectral density function of 1H nuclear spin in the 13C-1H pair in 13C-labeled formic
acid J (0H ) - J (2H )  J (0C ) - J (2C ) corresponding to the 13C nuclear spins. Therefore it is possible to achieve polarization transfer from NV centers to 1H nuclear spins, when polarization transfer to 13C nuclear
spins is suppressed. One has distinguished polarization differences in the 13C-1H pair, see Fig. 1(b).
When B = 0.36 T, as discussed in Ref. [27], the quan-
tization axis of all NV centers is along the magnetic field,
and the orientation of the symmetry axis of the NV cen-
ter relative to the magnetic field is uniformly distributed

over the unit sphere. The Hamiltonian of the NV center is given by [27]

E = (2)20 MHz. When B = 0.36 T (eB  D), the di-

rection of the magnetic field defines the z-axis of the labo-

ratory frame,  denotes the angle between the NV center

symmetry axis and the magnetic field axis. Clearly, the

random orientations of the NV centers cause a variation

of the zero-field splitting D() across the entire interval

[-(2)1.43 GHz, (2)2.87 GHz] and () across the in-

terval [0 MHz, (2)140 MHz].

When eB  D, for an ensemble of randomly oriented nanodiamonds, the NV centers will be optically pumped

to the state |ms = 0  that is defined by the relative orientation of the NV center with respect to the externally

applied magnetic field [27]. As discussed in Ref. [27], two

coordinate systems can be transformed into each other

and employing of Sz = cos Sz -sin (cos Sx -sin Sy), we can express the eigenstate |ms = 0  in the lab frame,

|ms = 0  = cos |0

+ sin  (ei| + 1 2

- e-i| - 1 ).

(4)

If  is large, the eigenstate |0 of the NV center in the

laboratory frame differs significantly from the zero-field

eigenstate |0  of the NV center. Hence optical initialization of randomly oriented NV centers lead to very differ-

ent states depending on the orientation of the NV cen-

ter. For   [80, 100], the population in state |0 is

very small and the initial state is well approximated by

to the strong dependence of the energy splitting between

the spin levels on , for each NV spin with a specific (),

there is a detuning from resonance which leads to  in

Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). We can see that high steady-state

polarization of 1H nuclear spins is achieved for a wide

range of detuning from the resonance, when the steady-

state polarization of 13C nuclear spins stay low, as shown

in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). Here we focus on the near resonant

case around  = 90 ( < (2)10 MHz involves 5% NV

flow channel is composed of a tube of a diameter of 1 mm,

the size of the hydrogel layer is 1 mm and the resulting

volume is filled with NDs of 10nm diameter such that they account for 12% of the total volume. We choose the flow rate of v = 10-3 m/s (this flow rate is achieved with commercial pumps, where flow rates over 10 times larger have been achieved in similar systems [26], and negligibly affects the molecular dynamics within c) such that t1  1s. Formic acid samples are used with mixtures of 13C-labeled formic acid and H2O (in the proportion 10:1). The hydroxyl proton can be ignored because twoand three-bond couplings between the 13C-1H system and the acidic proton can be neglected due to rapid exchange in protic solvents. Given the density of spin pairs in the sample 13 nm-3, we obtain Ne/NH = Ne/NC  1.6 × 10-6, different polarizations of the 13C and 1H nuclear spins could be achievable in the solution. For example, when c = 15ns, we have pH  0.6%  pC as shown in Fig. 3.

FIG. 4. (Color online) The preparation of heteronuclear spin singlet order hyperpolarization includes two processes, spin polarization built-up and singlet order generation. The magnetic field strength changes from 0.36 T to 10 mG. Figure in dashed box considers energy levels for 13C-1H heteronuclear spin pairs, in the presence of a scalar coupling with the coupling
strength g = 220 Hz. The eigenstates and eigenenergies of the system vary with the magnetic field (see Eq. (1)), and the population distribution is adiabatically transformed into the singlet and triplet eigenstates at zero magnetic field.

III. SINGLET ORDER GENERATION
As shown in Fig. 4, the energy levels of the coupled spin pair change as a function of the magnetic field. According to Eq. (1), when niB  g, the eigenstates are product states of the form |CH , |CH , |CH , |C H . Around the level anti-crossing with ni B  g, the eigenstates are given by |S0 , |T0 , |T+1 , |T-1 . The correspondence between the low-field and high-field states is

(|C H

|C H  |T+1 = |C H ,

|C H  |T-1 = |C H .

(6)

Polarization of the zero-field levels could be achieved when the sample flows out of the polarizing cell and is collected in a region of low magnetic field (a solenoid generating a magnetic field of 10 mG), because the high-field eigenstates are adiabatically transformed into the nuclear singlet |S0 and triplet |TM energy eigenstates in the low magnetic field, as shown in Fig. 4. Here the transit occurs as t2 = 0.3 s to match the adiabatic condition to make sure that populations of the hyperpolarized highfield states are adiabatically transferred to those of the low-field states. When the sample flows out of the polarizing cell, the populations of the states of the nuclear

pair are given by

Singlet order is defined by the difference between the population of the singlet state and the mean population of the three triplet states of the spin-1/2 pair in the low magnetic field. If relaxation losses during transport are neglected, singlet order is given by

In our case by considering correlation time c = 15 ns, there is a big polarization difference between the heteronuclear 13C-1H spins in the spin pairs (pH  pC ), pS  -pH/3  -0.2%. Hyperpolarized singlet order is therefore available, when the sample flows out of the polarizing cell. The singlet polarization may be comparable to the longitudinal order and substantial compared
to thermal polarization. The negative sign arises since strong polarization leads to an excess population in the
triplet state, depleting the singlet state.

IV. CONCLUSION
To summarize, we have shown that the hyperpolarized heteronuclear singlet order of 13C-1H spin pairs in formic

5

aid is available in the by using the NV centers in nanodiamonds at room temperature. The achieved singlet order is about a third of the longitudinal hyperpolarization of 1H spin, and we employ optical polarization of electron spins and all the procedures are implemented at room temperature without additional hardware and complexity involved in other singlet preparation methods.
