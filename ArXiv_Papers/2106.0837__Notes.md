## Abstract

Fungi cells are capable of sensing extracellular cues through reception, transduction and response systems which allow them to communicate with their host and adapt to their environment. They display effective regulatory protein expressions which enhance and regulate their response and adaptation to a variety of triggers such as stress, hormones, light, chemicals and host factors. In our recent studies, we have shown that $Pleurotus$ oyster fungi generate electrical potential impulses in the form of spike events as a result of their exposure to environmental, mechanical and chemical triggers, demonstrating that it is possible to discern the nature of stimuli from the fungi electrical responses. Harnessing the power of fungi sensing and intelligent capabilities, we explored the communication protocols of fungi as reporters of human chemical secretions such as hormones, addressing the question if fungi can sense human signals. We exposed $Pleurotus$ oyster fungi to cortisol, directly applied to a surface of a hemp shavings substrate colonised by fungi, and recorded the electrical activity of fungi. The response of fungi to cortisol was also supplementary studied through the application of X-ray to identify changes in the fungi tissue, where receiving cortisol by the substrate can inhibit the flow of calcium and, in turn, reduce its physiological changes. This study could pave the way for future research on adaptive fungal wearables capable for detecting physiological states of humans and biosensors made of living fungi.
