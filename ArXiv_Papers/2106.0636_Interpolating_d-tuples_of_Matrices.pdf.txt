Abstract. We study interpolating sequences of d-tuples of matrices, by looking at the commuting and the non-commuting case separately. In both cases, we will give a characterization of such sequences in terms of separation conditions on suitable reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and we will give sufficient conditions stated in terms of separation via analytic functions. Examples of such interpolating sequences will also be given.

1. Introduction

Let H be the algebra of bounded analytic functions on the unit disc, normed with

|||| := sup |(z)|
zD

  H.

A sequence Z := (zn)nN in the unit disc D is interpolating if, for any bounded sequence (wn)nN in C, there exists a bounded analytic function  such that (zn) = wn, for any n in N. Intuitively, an interpolating sequence is a separated sequence, as we want to specify the values of a bounded holomorphic functions arbitrarily at the nodes. Since we work with analytic functions in the unit disc, a natural way to measure the distance between the points of a sequence is by using the pseudo-hyperbolic distance

(z, w) = |bw(z)| :=

w-z 1 - wz

z, w  D.

Here bw denotes the involutive Blaschke factor at w. The sequence Z is said to be strongly separated if

inf
nN

(zn, zj ) > 0

j=n

whereas z is weakly separated if

inf (zn, zj) > 0.
n=j
Since any function  in H with zeros of multiplicities m1, . . . , ml at the points 1, . . . , l in D is divisible in H by a Blaschke product

l

=g

bmjj ,

j=1

where ||g|| = ||||, being weakly separated is equivalent to the existence, for any pair of distinct indices n and j, of a function n,j in the unit ball of H that vanishes at zj
and such that |n,j(zn)|  , for some positive  independent of n and j. Analogously,
Z is strongly separated if and only if there exists a positive  such that, for any n in N, there exists a function n in the unit ball of H that vanishes at all points of the sequence

except zn and |n(zn)|  .

Let H2 be the Hardy space, that is, the Hilbert space of analytic functions on the unit disc with square summable Taylor coefficients. Carleson characterized interpolating sequences in the unit disc in [7] and [8]:

Theorem 1.1. Let Z be a sequence in the unit disc. The following are equivalent:

(i): Z is interpolating; (ii): Z is strongly separated; (iii): Z is weakly separated and the measure

µZ := (1 - |zn|2)zn
nN

satisfies the embedding condition

(1.1)

||f ||L2(D,µZ)  C ||f ||H2

f  H2.

Condition (1.1) can be extended to more general settings, as it can be expressed in terms of the Euclidean geometry of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. A reproducing kernel Hilbert space on a domain X of Cd is a Hilbert space H of functions on X such that point evaluation at any x in X is continuous. Thanks to Riesz representation Theorem, this implies that, for any x in X, there exists a function kx in H such that

(1.2)

f (x) = f, kx H

This define a function k : X × X  C by

f  H.

k(x, y) = ky(x)

which is referred as a kernel on X. To emphasize the dependence on the kernel k of the Hilbert space H, we will denote the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space by Hk, where necessary. Each reproducing kernel Hilbert space Hk has a so called multiplier algebra
Mk := { : X  C | f  Hk, f  Hk}

defined as the algebra of those functions on X that multiplies Hk into itself. Thanks to the closed graph Theorem, any function  in Mk induces a bounded linear operator M on Hk by
M(f ) :=  f f  Hk.

In particular, Mk is normed by

||||Mk := ||M||B(Hk).
The Hardy space H2 is one of the most studied examples of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, together with its Szegö kernel

sw(z)

:=

1 1 - wz

z, w  D.

Its multiplier algebra Ms coincides isometrically with H. A measure µ on X is a Carleson measure for H if L2(X, µ) embeds continuously in H.

Hence (1.1) says precisely that µZ is a Carleson measure for H2.

It turns out that separation conditions on a sequence Z correspond to separation conditions

on the kernel functions at the point of such sequence. More precisely, let

h^

h ||h||

be the normalization of any element in a Hilbert space H, and recall that a sequence (hn)nN of unit vectors in H is a Riesz system if there exists a positive C such that, for any (an)nN in l2,

(1.3)

1 C2

|an|2 

nN

2

anhn  C2

|an|2.

nN

H

nN

If the right inequality holds, we say that (hn)nN is a Bessel system. The least constant C in (1.3) is denoted by the Riesz constant of the sequence (hn)nN. Shapiro and Shields proved in [14] that a sequence Z in D is interpolating if and only if the sequence (s^zn)nN of normalized Szegö kernels at the points of the sequence is a Riesz system. Moreover, one
can find in [3, Th. 9.5] a proof that, given any reproducing kernel Hilbert space Hk on a domain X and given a sequence (xn)nN of points in X, then the measure

µX :=

||kxn ||-H2k xn

nN

is a Carleson measure for H if and only if the sequence (k^xn)nN is a Bessel system in H. In particular, (1.1) can be restated as the sequence of normalized Szegö kernels at the points of Z being a Bessel system in the Hardy space. Such results, other than constitute a valuable correspondence between separation of points via holomorphic functions on a domain X and separation of the respective kernel functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, are extremely useful for extending Carleson's Theorem to more general settings.

One of the various efforts meant to extend Theorem 1.1 can be found in [9] and [10], where the author extended Carleson interpolation Theorem to sequences of square matrices (of any dimensions). A holomorphic function f on the unit disc is evaluated at a square matrix M via the following extension of Cauchy integral formula:

(1.4)

f (M )

:=

1 2i

f ()( Id - M )-1 d.
D

In particular, for f (M ) to be defined, the eigenvalues of M must lay in D. Given then
any sequence A := (An)nN of square matrices (of possibly different and not uniformly bounded dimensions) with spectra in the unit disc, one can extend the classic definition
of interpolating sequences by identifying a sequence of bounded targets with a bounded sequence in H:

Definition 1.2. A is interpolating if, for any bounded sequence (n)nN in H there exists a bounded analytic function  such that

(An) = n(An) n  N.

As for separating the matrices in A, one can follow the same outline as for scalars, and
define A to be weakly separated if there exists a  > 0 such that, for any pair of distinct indices j and n, there exits a function n,j in the unit ball of H such that

n,j(Aj ) = 0 (An) =  Id.

In the same fashion, A is said to be strongly separated if there exists a bounded sequence of H functions (n)nN such that

n(Aj ) = n,j Id.

ALBERTO DAYAN

In order to extend the Carleson measure condition in (1.1) to the sequence of square
matrices A, one has to consider separation conditions on finite dimensional subspaces of H2. For any n in N, let

(1.5)

Hn := H2  {f  H2 | f (An) = 0}

be the orthogonal complement in H2 of the subspace of all those H2 functions that vanish at An. Observe that if An = zn is a 1 × 1 scalar in D, then Hn is the line spanned by the Szegö kernel at zn, thanks to the reproducing property in (1.2). With this in mind, one can extend the notion of Riesz and Bessel system to any sequence (Hn)nN of closed subspaces of a Hilbert space H, by asking that there exists a positive C so that, for any sequence of unit vectors (hn)nN chosen in H so that each hn belongs to Hn, (1.3) holds (or, in the case of a Bessel system, the right inequality in (1.3) holds). Carleson's Theorem and Shapiro and Shields result in [14] can be then extended to this matrix node interpolation problem as follows, [9] [10]:

Theorem 1.3. Let A be a sequence of square matrices with spectra in the unit disc. The following are equivalent:
(i): A is interpolating; (ii): A is strongly separated; (iii): A is weakly separated and the sequence (Hn)nN defined in (1.5) is a Bessel
system in H2; (iv): (Hn)nN is a Riesz system in H2.
The aim of this note is to consider sequences of d-tuples of matrices (of any dimensions), and to determine whether some well known results on interpolating sequences in multivariable function theory extend to a matrix interpolation problem. The main distinction for such a multi-variable matrix interpolation problem from the scalar case is that a d-tuple
M = (M 1, . . . , M d)

of m × m matrices might commute or not. If the matrices in M commute, then (1.4) has a multi-variable analogue, and a bounded holomorphic function on the polydisc can be applied to M , provided that its joint spectrum belongs to Dd. On the other hand, not even a polynomial can be applied to M if its components do not commute, and therefore in order to study interpolating properties of sequences of d-tuples of non commuting matrices one has to consider a whole different class of functions. Given this intrinsic difference, this introduction will treat those two cases separately.

1.1. Interpolating d-tuples of Commuting Matrices. Let H d be the Banach algebra of bounded analytic functions on the polydisc Dd. A sequence Z = (zn)nN in Dd is interpolating for H d if, given any bounded (wn)nN in C there exists a bounded holomorphic function f on Dd so that f (zn) = wn, for all n. Berndtsson, Chang and Lin proved in [6] the following analogue of Theorem 1.1:
Theorem 1.4 (Berndtsson, Chang and Lin). Let Z = (zn)nN be a sequence in Dd, and let (a), (b) and (c) denote the following statements:
(a)

(1.6)

inf G(zn, zj) > 0;
nN j=n

(b) Z is interpolating for H d ;

(c) The measure

d

µZ :=

(1 - |zni |2) zn

nN i=1

is a Carleson measure for H2d and

(1.7)

inf G(zn, zj ) > 0.
n=j

Then (a) = (b) = (c), and if d  2 none of the converse implications hold.

H2d will be here the Hardy space on the polydisc, that is, the reproducing kernel Hilbert space on Dd with kernel

sd(z,

w)

:=

d i=1

1

1 - wizi

z, w  Dd.

Conditions (1.6) and (1.7) are separation conditions, both stated in terms of the so called

Gleason distance on the polydisc:

G(z,

w)

:=

max
i=1,...d

(zi,

wi)

z, w  Dd.

It turns out that G corresponds to separating points via bounded analytic function, since

(1.8)

G(z, w) = sup{|(z)| | ||||  1, (w) = 0}.

Throughout this note, (1.6) will refer to strong separation on the polydisc, while (1.7) defines a weakly separated sequence on the polydisc. Even if Theorem 1.4 does not characterize interpolating sequences in the polydisc, the case d = 2 provides a characterization of interpolating sequences by looking at the Euclidean geometry of those reproducing kernels Hilbert spaces whose multiplier algebra is H 2 . The main difference with the one-variable case is the fact that, rather than working with just the Szegö kernel, in order to obtain interpolating properties one has to consider a whole class of different kernels on the polydisc. In [2], Agler and McCarthy characterized interpolating sequences in the bi-disc in terms of separation conditions on the class of so called admissible kernels. A kernel k on Dd is admissibile if the multiplications by the coordinates

Mz1, . . . , Mzd

form a set of commuting contractions on Hk. Let Ad be the set of all admissible kernels on

Dd, and let Bd be the set of all kernels k on the d-dimensional polydisc whose multiplier

algebra H, we

coincide with have that Bd

H d .  Ad.

Since the coordinate functions are clearly in the unit ball Conversely, thanks to Ando's inequality [4], for any kernel

of in

B2

||(T1, T2)||B(Hk)  ||||

for any  in H 2 and for any pair (T1, T2) of commuting contractions on Hk. Since

M = (Mz1 , Mz2 )

  H 2

we have that

A2 = B2.
Namely, the class of admissible kernels coincides with the class of kernels on D2 whose multiplier algebra is H 2 .

Example 1.5. Let  := (1, . . . , d) be a d-tuple of positive integers. Then the kernel

sw (z )

:=

d i=1

(1

-

z, w  Dd

is admissible on Dd. Indeed, multiplication by the coordinates being a set of contractions is equivalent to assert that, for any z1, . . . , zN in Dd, the matrices

[(1 - zni zji )kzj (zn)]Nn,j=1

i = 1, . . . , d

are positive semi-definite. Therefore, since the Szegö kernel is admissible and the Schur (point-wise) product of positive semi-definite matrices is positive semi-definite, s belongs
to Ad for any .

Let, for any kernel k in A2
SZk := span{kzn }  Hk.
nN
Given a bounded sequence (wn)nN, if there exits a function  in the unit ball H 2 such that
(zn) = wn n  N,
then, for any k in A2, the operator
T k : SZk  SZk
such that T k(kzn ) = wnkzn
is a contraction in Hk. Indeed, T k is the restriction of M to SZk since, for any reproducing kernel Hilbert space Hk on domain X, the reproducing property of the kernel k implies that every kernel function is an eigenvector of the adjoint of multiplication by any multiplier:
M(kx) = (x) kx x  X,   Mk.
Conversely, [1], if sup ||T k||B(Hk)  1,
kA2
then each T k is in fact the restriction of the adjoint of the multiplication by a function  in the unit ball of H 2 , and (zn) = wn. This, together with Theroem 1.7 below, gives the following characterization for interpolating sequences for the bidisk, which is part of a result in [2]:

Theorem 1.6. Let Z = (zn)nN be a sequence in D2. Then Z is interpolating for H 2 if and only if there exists a constant C  1 such that, for any k in A2, the sequence of normalized kernels (k^zn )nN is a Reisz sequence in Hk with Riesz bound C.
As we will see, the key for the identification between Riesz systems of kernels functions and interpolating sequences for those reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces with extension properties is the following characterization of the Riesz system condition [12, Th. 3.1.4 ]:

Theorem 1.7. Let H = (Hn)nN be a sequence of closed sub-spaces of a Hilbert space H. The following are equivalent:
(i): H is a Riesz system with Riesz bound C;

Let M = (M 1, . . . , M d) be a d-tuple of matrices of size m, and let  be a function in H d . In order for
(M ) = (M 1, . . . , M d)

to makes sense the matrices in M must be commuting, so that the value of a bounded analytic function at M can be expressed via the matrix version of Cauchy integral formula:

(1.9)

(M )

:=

1 (2i)d

f (1, . . . , d)(1 Id - M 1)-1 . . . (d Id - M d)-1 d1 . . . dd,
Td

where Td is the d-dimensional torus. As for the one dimensional case, (1.9) makes sense provided that the joint spectrum of M belongs to Dd. In order to define the joint spectrum of M , recall that commuting matrices preserve each others invariant sub-spaces: consequently, M can be jointly upper-triangularizable, that is, there exits an m × m non singular matrix P such that

(1.10)

N i = P -1M iP

is upper triangular, for any i = 1, . . . , d. The joint spectrum of M is the (multi)-set (M ) = {(Nj1,j, . . . , Njd,j) | j = 1, . . . , d}  Cd.
In particular,  = (1, . . . , d) belongs to (M ) if and only if there exists a vector x in Cm that is a joint eigenvector for the components of M :
M ix = ix i = 1, . . . , d.

Definition 1.8. A sequence A = (An)nN of d-tuples of commuting matrices with joint spectra in Dd is interpolating for H d if for any bounded target sequence (n)nN in H d there exists a bounded analytic function  on the polydisc such that

(An) = n(An) n  N.

8

ALBERTO DAYAN

In order to separate the matrices in A we will extend (1.8) to this matrix setting by
defining the Gleason distance G between two d-tuples of commuting matrices M and N (of eventual different dimension) to be the supremum of all |r| > 0 such that there exists a function  in the unit ball of H so that

(N ) = 0, (M ) = r Id.

We will say then that the sequence A is weakly separated if

inf
n=j

G(An,

Aj )

>

0,

whereas (1.6) extends to define strongly separated sequences of commuting d-tuples by

inf
nN

G(An, Aj ) > 0.

j=n

If  is any subset of N not containing n, then the distance between An and A := (Aj)j is the inverse of the least norm of a function in H d that vanishes on (Aj)jN and it's the identity on An:

(1.11)

G(An,

A )

:=

inf {||||

| (An)

1 = Id,

(Aj )

=

0,

j



}.

As for the one dimensional case, one can relate interpolation conditions for the sequence A to separation condition on well chosen sub-spaces of some reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and the main difference with the theory in one variable is that one has to consider all the kernels in Bd, rather than only the Szegö kernel. Let then k be a kernel in Bd, and let M be a d-tuple of commuting matrices with joint spectra in Dd. Assume that a function f in Hk vanishes at M : without loss of generality, we can assume thanks to (1.10) that each M i is upper triangular. Let {z1, . . . , zd} be the joint spectrum of M . For any  in Td,

(1.12)

(i Id - M i)-1

has on its main diagonal multiples of

1 (i - zji)

j = 1, . . . , d

while on its second to main diagonal has a linear combination of factors of the form

1 (i - zji )2

j = 1, . . . , d,

where such linear combination depends exclusively on the algebraic structure of M , and

not on the kernel k. In this fashion, the l-th-to-main diagonal of (1.12) will contain linear

combinations of terms of the form

1 (i - zji )l

j = 1, . . . , d.

Hence, thanks to (1.9), f (M ) = 0 if and only if f vanishes to its joint spectrum, and so do some linear combinations of its partial derivatives at the points of its joint spectrum.

Example 1.9. Let  and  be in D, and set

M=

Then the joint spectrum of M consists in just the point z = (, ) in D2 and, for any f holomorphic in D2,

f (M ) =

f (z) 0

21f (z) + 2f (z) f (z)

.

Thus

f (M )

Let A = (An)nN be a sequence of commuting d-tuples with joint spectra in Dd. For any positive integer n and for any kernel k in Bd, define

(1.13)

Hnk := Hk  {f  Hk|f (An) = 0}  Hk.

By the above discussion Hnk is a finite dimensional sub-space of Hk spanned by the kernels at the points of the joint spectrum of An, together with some linear combinations of kernel
functions that represent partial derivatives at the joint spectrum of An. Moreover, if the
matrices in An have size sn, then

Hnk = {KAn (u, v) | u, v  Csn},

where, if (ej)jN is any orthonormal basis of Hk, KAn(u, v) is defined by

(1.14)

KAn(u, v) :=

v, ej (An)u Hk ej .

jN

In particular, the function KAn(u, v) satisfies

f, KAn (u, v) Hk =

ej (An)u, v Csn f, ej Hk

jN

(1.15)

=

f, ej Hk ej (An)u, v Csn

jN





=  f, ej Hk ej (An) u, v

jN

Csn

= f (An)u, v Csn

f  Hk,

which says that (1.14) does not depend on the choice of the basis (en)nN. Equation (1.15) works as a reproducing property for KAn(u, v) and implies that KAn(u, v) is linear in v and conjugate-linear in u. Most importantly, (1.15) implies that

(1.16)

M(KAn (u, v)) = KAn (u, (An)v)   H d .

It is worth noticing that, for any positive integer n, some of the KAn(u, v) might repeat while varying u and v. The following Lemma describes the relation on the pairs (u1, v1) and (u2, v2) in order for this to happen. If l is a multi-index in Nd, and N is a d-tuple of commuting matrices, we will write

N l := (N 1)l1 . . . (N d)ld .

Lemma 1.10. Let k be a kernel in Bd, and let N be a d-tuple of m×m commuting matrices with spectra in Dd. Let u1, v1, u2 and v2 be in Cm. Then KN (u1, v1) = KN (u2, v2) if and only if

(1.17)

N lu1, v1 Cm = N lu2, v2 Cm

l  Nd.

10

ALBERTO DAYAN

Proof. Let us first assume that KN (u1, v1) = KN (u2, v2). Thus, since each monic monomial zl belongs to H d and thanks to (1.16),
KN (u1, (N l)v1) = Mzl (KN (u1, v1)) = Mzl(KN (u2, v2)) = KN (u2, (N l)v2).
Therefore, if  is a polynomial such that (N ) = Id, the reproducing property in (1.15) implies that

u1, (N l)v1 Cm = , KN (u1, (N l)v1) Hk = , KN (u2, (N l)v2) Hk = u2, (N l)v2 Cm .

Conversely, assume that (1.17) holds. We have that KN (u1, v1) = KN (u2, v2) if and only if their inner product with any f in Hk coincide:

u1, f (N )v1 Cm = f, KN (u1, v1) Hk = f, KN (u2, v2) Hk = u2, f (N )v2 Cm

f  Hk.

The rightmost and the leftmost hand side of the above equation coincide, thanks to (1.17)

and modulo writing f in its power series.

Observe that (1.17) does not depend on the kernel k that we chose in Bd, but it depends exclusively on the algebraic structure of M .

Example 1.11. Let M be the pair of commuting matrices in Example 1.9. If e1 and e2 are the elements of the canonical basis of C2, then

KM (e1, e1) = KM (e2, e2) = kz,

KM (e1, e2) = 2kz(1,0) + kz(0,1)

KM (e2, e1) = 0,

where

kz(1,0)

:=

kz z1

and

kz(0,1)

:=

kz z2

are the kernels in Hk that represent, respectively, one derivative in the first variable and

one derivative in the second variable.

In Section 2, we will extend Theorem 1.6 to pairs of commuting matrices by replacing normalized admissible kernels with the collections (Hnk)nN:
Theorem 1.12. A sequence of pairs of commuting matrices is interpolating if and only if there exists a positive C such that, for any admissible kernel k on the bi-disc, the sequence
Hk = (Hnk)nN
is a Riesz system in Hk with Riesz bound C.

Since the approach we use to study interpolating sequences of matrices is mainly defined by looking at the Euclidean geometry of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and since we do not know whether Ad = Bd for d  3, we can only give a (stronger) sufficient condition to replace (1.6) in the case of the bi-disc:

Theorem 1.13. Let A = (An)nN be a sequence of pairs of commuting matrices with spectra in D2 such that

(1.18) Then A is interpolating.

G(An, AN\n) > 0.
nN

INTERPOLATING d-TUPLES OF MATRICES

11

Let us observe that (1.18) is a rather strong separation condition on A = (An)nN . In order to extend the sufficient condition in Theorem 1.4, one has would have to give a
positive answer to the following question:

Question 1. Is A interpolating, provided that

inf
nN

G(An, Aj ) > 0?

j=n

This remain, for us, open.
Section 2.4 will show that, given any sequence (mn)nN in N and any d  2, there exists an interpolating sequence A of d-tuples of commuting matrices such that each An has mn × mn coordinates.

1.2. Interpolating d-tuples of Non-Commuting Matrices. In order to study interpo-
lating properties of a sequence of eventually non-commuting d-tuples of matrices, one has
to change the class of functions to apply to such a sequence. Specifically, the robust and
highly active field of non-commutative (NC) functions is the environment in which
the discussion of Section 3 will take place. Fix d in N  {}. For any positive integer n, let M1n be the set of all n × n matrices with coefficient in C and, more generally, let Mdn be the set of all d-tuples of square matrices of size n. If d = , we require that the row norm

(1.19)

||X|| :=

X i (X i )

i

is bounded for any X in M n . Each Mdn is normed with (1.19) and endowed with the induced topology. Let us consider now arbitrarily large sizes by defining


Md := Mdn
n=1

as the disjoint union in n of d-tuples of n × n matrices. A topology of interest for us is the
so-called disjoint union (DU) topology: a subset  of Md is open if and only if all of its n components
(n) :=   Mdn n  N are open in Mdn. Moreover,  is a non-commutative (NC) set if it is closed under direct sums:
Z, W   = Z  W  .

A class of functions that can be defined on such an  is C z1, . . . , zd , the set of all free polynomials in d non-commuting variables. More generally, a function f :   M1 is a non-commutative (NC) function if
· f is graded : if Z is in (n), then f (Z) belongs to M1n; · f respects direct sums: for any Z and W in , then f (Z  W ) = f (Z)  f (W ); · f respects similarities: for any Z in (n) and for any invertible P in M1n, then
f (P -1ZP ) = P -1f (Z)P , provided that P -1ZP belongs to .

One can easily check that any NC polynomial is an NC function on . An NC function f is holomorphic on  if it is locally bounded. The domain of interest for us in order to extend interpolation results to this NC setting is the NC unit ball
Bd := Z  Md ||Z|| < 1 ,

and the interpolating functions will be chosen from the algebra of bounded NC analytic functions

where

||f || := sup ||f (Z)||.

Definition 1.2 adapts also to this non-commutative setting: a sequence (Zn)nN in Bd (of

As for the well-known scalar case, the understanding of NC interpolating sequences goes

through the study of related Hilbert spaces. Let Wd be the set of words with d generators,

and let







Hd2 := f =

al Z l



lWd

||f ||22 :=

 |al|2 < 

lWd



be the so-called NC Drury Arveson space of those formal NC power series with squaresummable coefficients. It turns out that Hd2 can be seen as an NC reproducing kernel Hilbert space. More specifically, for any W in Bd(n) and for any pairs of vectors u and v in Cn, let

(1.20)

KW (u, v)(Z) :=

v, W lu Zl

lWd

Z  B.

The function KW (u, v) is linear in v and conjugate-linear in u. Salomon, Shalit and Shamovich showed in [13, Prop. 3.2] that Hd2 is generated by the NC functions in (1.20), and that for any f in Hd2 and for any W in Bd(n)

(1.21)

f, KW (u, z) H2d = f (W )u, v Cn .

Moreover, the multiplier algebra of Hd2

MH2d := { NC holomorphic function on Bd | f  Hd2, f  Hd2} is isometrically identifiable with Hd, [13, Coro. 3.6], and the reproducing property in (1.21) implies that

M(KW (u, v)) = KW (u, (W )v)   Hd.

Similarly to Section 2, in Section 3 we will describe interpolating sequences in terms of

separated sequences. Moreover, we will see how to separated elements in Bd correspond

separated Z and W

sub-spaces of Bd is the

of Hd2. inverse

Specifically, of the least

the NC norm of

Gleason distance between two elements an Hd NC function that vanishes at W

and that is the identity at Z:

NC (Z, W )

:=

inf {||||

1 | (Z) =

Id, (W )

=

0} .

As in (1.11), we might also want to separate Z from a whole sequence (Wn)nN via

NC (Z, (Wn)nN)

:=

inf {||||

| (Z)

=

1 Id, (Wn)

=

0, n



N} .

INTERPOLATING d-TUPLES OF MATRICES

13

We will see in Section 3 how an analogue of the Pick property for the NC Drury-Arveson

space implies that separation conditions on a sequence (Zn)nN in Bd correspond to separated sequences of sub-spaces of Hd2 defined as

(1.22)

Hn := Hd2  {f  Hd2 | f (Zn) = 0}.

Since the right hand side of the reproducing property (1.21) vanishes for any u and v if and only if f (W ) = 0, we have that,

(1.23)

Hn = {KZn (u, v) | u, v  Cmn },

where we assume that Zn belongs to Bd(mn) for any n. Interpolating sequences can be then characterized via separation conditions in Hd2:

Theorem 1.14. Z is interpolating if and only if the sequence (Hn)nN is a Riesz system in Hd2.

As a consequence, we will show that a separation condition on the sequence Z is sufficient for it to be interpolating:

Theorem 1.15. If

(1.24) then Z is interpolating.

NC (Zn, (Zj )j=n) > 0
nN

Condition (1.24) is a rather strong separation condition on the sequence Z. It would be interesting for us to know whether such condition can be relaxed:

Question 2. Is any sequence Z in Bd satisfying

inf
nN

NC (Zn, Zj ) > 0

j=n

an interpolating sequence?

A positive answer to Question 2 would extend a result from Berndtsson in [5] to this non commutative setting. An even more ambitious goal would be to prove an analogue of Carleson interpolation Theorem for the noncommutative setting. In particular, we ask whether strongly separated sequences are interpolating, and whether weakly separated sequences whose sequence (Hn)nN is a Bessel system are interpolating:

Question 3. Is Z interpolating, provided that

inf
nN

NC (Zn,

(Zj )j=n)

>

0?

Question 4. Is Z interpolating, provided that

inf NC (Zn, Zj ) > 0
n=j
and (Hn)nN is a Bessel system?

An example of an interpolating sequence of pairs of non-commuting matrices in B2 will be given in Section 3.2.

The author would like to thanks John McCarthy for the many discussions that led to this note.

2. Commuting Pairs
The main goal of this Section is to prove Theorem 1.12 and Theorem 1.13. In order to do so, we will first extend in Section 2.1 Agler's argument in [1] to a commuting matrix nodes interpolation problem. Section 2.2 will then prove Theorem 2.6, which contains Theorem 1.12 and also shows that Definition 1.8 can be relaxed to an a priori weaker (yet equivalent) notion of interpolating d-tuples of commuting matrices where a target sequence can be identified with a bounded sequence in C. In Section 2.3 we will then look for a sufficient condition in order for a sequence of d-tuples of commuting matrices to be interpolating which is stated in terms of the Gleason distance on the polydisc, and thus prove Theorem 1.13.

2.1. Admissible Kernels. The key step for the proof of Theorem 1.12 is to extend Agler's argument in [1] to the matrix case. Let A1, . . . , AN be finitely many d-tuples of commuting matrices with spectra in Dd, of eventually different sizes s1, . . . , sN . Given the formal sets

Kj := {Kj (u, v)|u, v  Csj } j = 1, . . . , N

define an equivalence relation j on Kj that makes the elements in Kj linear in v, conjugate linear in u, and that sets Kj(u1, v1) j Kj(u2, v2) if and only if

Alj u1, v1 Csj = Alj u2, v2 Csj

l  Nd.

Let

Fj := Kj/ j j = 1, . . . , N

and let F be the set of formal linear combinations of the elements of Nj=1Fj. Since each Fj is a finite dimensional vector space, so is F . A kernel k~ on F is a choice of a strictly positive scalar product on F . Let Fk~ be the Hilbert space (F, k~). In this finite-nodes setting, k~ is admissible if, for any i = 1, . . . , d, the linear map Tik~ : Fk~  Fk~ defined by

(2.1)

Tik~([Kj (u, v)]j ) := [Kj (u, (Aij )v)]j

is a contraction. Observe that each Tik~ is well defined thanks to Lemma 1.10. In particular, if k is an admissible kernel on Dd, then

span{HAk j | j = 1 . . . , N }  Hk

is isometric to some Fk~. In other words, Fk~ works as a restriction of an admissible kernel to the finite nodes A1, . . . , AN . For the sake of notation, k will indicate both a kernel on Dd and the scalar product on F which restricts k to our finite nodes of d-tuples of matrices. Let 1, . . . , N be targets in H 2 , and suppose that there exists a contraction  in H 2 such that
(Aj) = j(Aj) j = 1, . . . , N.
Then, thanks to (1.16), for any kernel in k in A2 the map Rk : span{HAk j | j = 1, . . . , N }  span{HAk j | j = 1, . . . , N } given by

(2.2)

Rk(KAj (u, v)) = KAj (u, j (Aj )v) j = 1, . . . , N

is a restriction of M, and therefore is a contraction. Conversely,

INTERPOLATING d-TUPLES OF MATRICES

15

Theorem 2.1. Let 1, . . . , N be in H 2 such that, if Rk is defined as in (2.2),

(2.3)

sup ||Rk||  1.
kA2

Then there exists a function  in H 2 such that ||||  1 and

(Aj) = j(Aj) j = 1, . . . , N.

Theorem 2.1 works as an extension property for all admissible kernels, provided that the necessary bounds are uniform in A2. The proof of Theorem 2.1 has a strong operator theory flavour: the first main tool is the following Lemma, due to Parrot:

Lemma 2.2 (Parrot's Lemma). Let Hi and Ki, i = 1, 2, be Hilbert spaces, Let A : H1  K1, B : H2  K1 and C : H1  K2 be linear operators. For any D : H2  K2, let

WD :=

A C

B D

: H1  H2  K1  K2.

Then

sup ||WD|| = max
DB(H2 ,K2 )

A C

,
B(H1 ,K1 K2 )

A B B(H1H2,K1) .

For a proof, see [3, Lemma B.1].
The second technical tool can be proved for any d  2, and it will allow us to go from one
admissible kernel to another, making a full use of the uniform bound in (2.3). Let k be an admissibile kernel on Dd, and let z be a point in Dd. Let

H0 : span{HAk j | j = 1, . . . , N }  Hk
and H1 := span{H0, kz}. Assume that kz is not in H0, so that H0 is strictly contained in H1. Define G0 := H1  span{kz}, and let L0 : H0  G0 be the restriction on H0 of the orthogonal projection P0 onto G0:

L0 := (P0)|H0 .
As we already pointed out, H0 is isometric to a finite admissible kernel structure Fk on A1, . . . , AN . It turns out that L(H0) corresponds to a finite admissible kernel structure as well:

Lemma 2.3. Define, for any j = 1, . . . , N and for any u and v in Csj

Gj(u, v) := L0(KAj (u, v))  G0. Then the vector space
{Gj(u, v) | j = 1, . . . , N, u, v  Csj }  Hk together with the inner product

g(Gj (u1, v1), Gl(u2, v2)) := Gj (u1, v1), Gl(u2, v2) Hk is a finite admissible kernel structure on A1, . . . , AN .

Proof. Observe that H1 is an admissible kernel structure on the N +1 nodes, A1, . . . , AN , z. Hence the map T~ik such that

T~ik(x) =

Tik(x) if zi kz if

x  H0 x = kz

i = 1, . . . , d

16

ALBERTO DAYAN

extends Tik defined in (2.1) to a contraction on H1. Since the maps

Si := P0(T~ik)|G0

i = 1, . . . , d

are contractions, it suffices to show that

(2.4)

Tig = Si i = 1, . . . , d.

Since span{kz} is invariant under each T~ik, we have

P0T~ik(Id - P0) = 0 i = 1, . . . , d,

and therefore, for any f in H0

SiL(f ) = P0T~ikP0(f ) = P0T~ik(f ) = P0Tik(f ) = LTik(f ) i = 1, . . . , d.

Thus Si = LTikL-1 is similar to Tik and therefore Si(Gj (u, v)) = L(Kj(u, (Ai)v)) = Gj(u, (Ai)v) = Tig(Gj (u, v)),

proving (2.4).

We are now ready to prove Theorem 2.1. In order to do so, it suffices to show that, for any z in Dd, one can choose an optimal w in C such that, for any admissible kernel k, R~k : H1  H1 given by

(2.5)

R~wk (x) :=

Rk(x) if wkz if

x  H0 x = kz

extends Rk defined in (2.2) without changing its norm:

Theorem 2.4. For any z in Dd, there exists a w in C such that

sup ||R~wk || = sup ||Rk||.

kAd

kAd

Theorem 2.1 follows then from Theorem 2.4: let Z = (zn)nN be a sequence of uniqueness for D2, i. e., a sequence such that any holomorphic function is uniquely determined by
its values at Z (for example, any sequence converging to 0). By iterating Theorem 2.4 we extend Rk isometrically to the nested sub-spaces

Hnk := span{Hnk-1, kzn } n  N

by choosing an optimal value wi at each step, independently of the admissible kernel k. This leads to construction of a map on the Hardy space H2(D2)

R : H2(D2)  H2(D2)

that has all the Szegö kernels as its eigenvetors, and which hence commutes with any Mzi. Such a map will have then to be the adjoint of multiplication by

 := R(1),

and since M = R is a contraction, then |||| = 1. Moreover, since M conicide with Mj on each Hjk, then  agrees with j on each pair Aj.

Proof of Theorem 2.4. Let k be an admissible kernel on Dd, and let Rk be defined as in (2.2). Let R~wk be the extension in (2.5). Define
G := H1  span{kz} F := H1  H0.

INTERPOLATING d-TUPLES OF MATRICES

17

Split then R~wk into (2.6)

R~wk =

A C

B D

,

where

A : H0  G B: F  G C : H0  span{kz} D : F  span{kz}.

The column

A C

is then Rk, while the top row is R~wk pre-composed with the orthogonal

projection P onto G:

A B = P R~wk .

In particular,

A C

does not depend on w. Most importantly, B does not depend on w

either, since R~wk has kz as one of its eigevenctors and G is orthogonal to kz, which in particular implies

B = (P R~wk )|F = (P Rk)|F .

Therefore the whole dependence on w in (2.6) is carried by D. In particular,

D: f  F 

w||f kz, f

||2
Hk

kz

ranges among any possible complex number, as w ranges in C. Moreover, observe that if

T k := (P R~wk )|G,

then ||P R~wk ||  ||T k|| (and hence the two norms are indeed equal), since for any v = u +  in H1, where u is in G and  is in span{kz}, one has

||P R~wk (v)|| = ||T k(u)||  ||T k||||u||  ||T k||||v||,

thanks to orthogonality. Thus Lemma 2.2 implies that there exists a choice of w such that

||R~wk || = max{||Rk||, ||T k||}.

To conclude, it suffices to observe that thanks to Lemma 2.3 G carries an admissible structure g, and that therefore

T k = p(T1k, . . . , Tdk)
is unitarly equivalent to Rg = p(T1g, . . . , Tdg),
for any polynomial p such that p(Aj) = j(Aj) for any j = 1, . . . , N . Thus ||R~wk || = max{||Rk||, ||Rg||}  sup ||Rg||.
gAd
Since k was chosen arbitrarily in Ad, this concludes the proof.

ALBERTO DAYAN

Remark 2.5. As a main consequence of Theorem 2.1, the Gleason distance G(M, N )
between two pairs of commuting matrices corresponds to the sine of the least angle between HMk and HNk , where k ranges among all admissible kernels in D2. Indeed, if  in H 2 has norm C and separates M and N , i.e.

(M ) = Id (N ) = 0,

then for any admissible kernel k the operator M acts like the identity on HMk and like the zero operator on HNk . Since ||M|| = C, the angle between HMk and HNk is greater than
1/C .

Conversely, if

inf
kA2

sin(HMk

,

HNk

,

then Theorem 2.1 (A1 = M, A2 = N, 1 = 1, 2 = 0) implies that there exists a function  whose H norm does not exceed C that separates M and N , hence G(M, N )  1/C.

2.2. Diagonal Targets. Theorem 1.12 follows from Theorem 2.1:

Theorem 2.6. Let A = (An)nN be a sequence of pairs of commuting matrices with spectra in the bi-disc, and let Hk = (Hnk)nN be, for any kernel in A2, the associated sequence of closed sub-spaces of Hk defined in (1.13). The following are equivalent:
(i): A is interpolating; (ii): For any bounded sequence (wn)nN in C there exists a function  in H 2 such
that
(An) = wn Id n  N;
(iii): There exists a C > 0 such that, for any k in A2, Hk is a Riesz system in Hk with Riesz bound C;
(iv): There exists a sequence (fn)nN such that fn(Aj) = n,j and

sup |fn(z)| < .
zD2 nN
The proof of the equivalence between (ii) and (iv) follows the same outline of [9, Th. 4.1]: such an argument is indeed valid since Montel's Theorem extends to H 2 . Therefore, it suffices to show (i) = (ii) = (iii) = (i). Moreover, the equivalence between (i) and (ii) says that, as for the one variable case, the notion of interpolating sequences for pairs of commuting matrices is indeed equivalent to one that a priori is weaker, asking to find interpolating functions for only diagonal targets.

Proof. Trivially, (i) implies (ii), by considering a constant target sequence

n(z) = wn z  D2.

The implication (ii) = (iii) follows from Theorem 1.7, by observing that, thanks to (ii), for any admissible kernel k on D2

µk = M : span{Hnk}  span{Hnk}

nN

nN

whenever (µk)Hnk = wn Id|Hnk .
Finally, (iii) = (i) follows from Theorem 2.1, Theorem 1.7 and a normal family argument. Indeed, let (n)nN be a bounded sequence in H 2 , and fix a positive integer N . By Hk having a Riesz bound C for any admissible k, one has that the operator Rk defined in (2.2)

INTERPOLATING d-TUPLES OF MATRICES

19

is bounded by C for any k in A2, thanks to Theorem 1.7. Thus by Theorem 2.1 there exists a function fN whose H 2 norm doesn't exceed C and
fN (A1) = 1(A1), . . . , fN (AN ) = N (AN ). Since the sequence (fN )NN is bounded in H 2 , it has a sub-sequence that converges in H 2 to , which agrees with n at An, for any n in N.
2.3. A More Explicit Sufficient Condition. In this Section we will prove Theorem 1.13. Thanks to Remark 2.5, condition (1.18) implies that

(2.7)

sin Hnk, span{Hjk}

nN

j=n

is uniformly bounded below for any k in A2. Thanks to Theorem 1.12, it suffices then to show that any sequence H = (Hn)nN of closed subspaces of a Hilbert space H satisfying (2.7) is a Riesz system. In order to do so, we will use Theorem 1.7, (i)  (iv). Fix a finite subset  of N, and enumerate the elements in c by {j1, j2, . . . }. For the sake of brevity, let H := span{Hj} and
j

Si := span{H, Hj1, . . . , Hji} i  N.

Namely, if S0 = H, then each Si is obtained by adding a subspace not labeled in  to the linear span of Si-1. Let P0 be the identity on H, and define Pi : Si  Si by

Pi(x) :=

Pi-1(x) 0

if x  Si-1 . if x  Hji

Thanks to Theorem 1.7, (i)  (iv), we need to prove the following

Proposition 2.7. Let (Hn)nN be a sequence of closed sub-spaces of a Hilbert space H such that

(2.8) Then

sin(Hn, HN\{n}) > 0

This will be done by analyzing how much does the operator norm increase when extending Pi to Pi+1:

Lemma 2.8. Let H and F be two closed subspaces of a Hilbert space H that intersect
trivially. Let d be the distance (equivalently, the sine of the angle) between H and K, and let T be any bounded operator from H to itself. Then the operator T~ : span{H, F } 
span{H, F } such that

T~(x) := T (x) if 0 if

xH xF

extends T and has norm

ALBERTO DAYAN

Proof. Let G := span{H, F }  H be the orthogonal complement of H in span{H, F }, and fix a unit vector x in span{H, F }. Then x can be written uniquely as

x = y + z y  G z  H,

where y and z are unit vectors and ||2 + ||2 = 1, thanks to orthogonality. Moreover, y can be written as
y = h + f h  H f  F,

where

||h||2

and

T~(y)

Therefore,

||T~(x)||2 =||T (h + z)||2 ||T ||2 ||h + z||2 =||T ||2 (2r2 + 2 + 2Re h, z ) ||T ||2 (2r2 + 2 + 2||||r) =||T ||2(r|| + ||)2.

Thus

is bounded below, and Proposition 2.7 follows. This concludes the proof of Theorem 1.13.

2.4. An Example via Random Interpolating Sequences in the Polydisc. In certain
instances, considering a random sequence (of scalars) in the polydisc can help to understand
the conditions in Theorem 1.4 and their relation. This is the motivation that led the authors in [11] to study random interpolating sequences. A random sequence in Dd is a sequence with pre-fixed deterministic radii and random arguments in Td: let (n1, . . . , nd)nN be a sequence of independent and indentically distributed random variables taking values on Td,
all distributed uniformly and defined on the same probability space (, A, P). Let (rn)nN be a sequence in [0, 1)d, and define a random sequence  = (n)nN in Dd as

n() = rn1 ein1 (), . . . , rnd eind () ,

  .

Looking for separation conditions on (rn)nN that yield almost sure interpolating properties for , partition Dd into the following dyadic radial rectangles

Im := {z  Dd : 1 - 2-mi  |zi| < 1 - 2-(mi+1), i = 1, . . . d}

INTERPOLATING d-TUPLES OF MATRICES

21

and count the number of points of  that fall into each Im:
Nm = |  Im|,
for any multi-index m = (m1, . . . , md) in Nd. Observe that (Nm)mNd depends exclusively on the sequence (rn)nN, and therefore it is a deterministic quantity. The smaller the sequence (Nm)mNd is, the fastest the random sequence  escapes any compact subset of the polydisc, and therefore (at least intuitively) the most chances it has to be interpolating. This is the idea behind [11, Coro 1.4] ( here |m| = m1 + · · · + md will denote the length of m) :

Theorem 2.9. If

(2.10)

Nm1+

1 d

2-

|m| d

< ,

mNd

then  is interpolating almost surely. If

Nm2 2-|m| = ,
mNd
then  is not interpolating almost surely.

Random interpolating sequences help to construct examples of interpolating sequences of d-tuples of commuting matrices of any dimensions. Let indeed (mn)nN be a sequence of positive integeres, and choose, for any n in N, mn points n,1, . . . , n,mn on the d-torus. A sequence of d-tuples of commuting matrices having those points as their joint spectra is W = (Wn)nN, where
Wni := diag(ni ,1, . . . , ni ,mn).
In order for the joint spectra to belong to Dd, let us re-scale the matrices in W via a sequence (rn)nN in [0, 1)d:

An := (rn1 Wn1, . . . , rnd Wnd) n  N.

The more sparse the sequence (rn)nN is the more separated the joint spectra of the matrices in A := (An)nN are. It is natural then to ask if there is a choice of the radii (rn)nN that makes the sequence A interpolating, for some choice of the sequence T := (n,j). Let (n)nN be a sequence in Nd and let

rni = 1 - 2-in .

If the point in T are uniformly randomly chosen Td independently one from the other and if

(2.11)

m 2 <  1+
n

1 d

-

(in

+···+dn ) d

nN

then the collection Z of all joint eigenvalues of A satisfies (2.10) and therefore Z is interpolating almost surely, thanks to Theorem 2.9. Fixed (mn)nN, it will suffice then to choose the sequence (n)nN diverging fast enough in order for (2.11) to hold. This will give a whole family of possible choices of the parameters in T for which Z (and hence A) is interpolating. In particular, there exists a sequence of interpolating d-tuples of commuting matrices given any choice for their dimensions.

3. Non Commuting d-tuples

The aim of this Section is to prove Theorem 1.14 and Theorem 1.15. This will be done in Section 3.1 by showing that the NC Drury-Arveson space has an extension property which works as analogue of the Pick property of the classic DruryArveson space. Section 3.2 will then consider an explicit example of a class of sequences of pairs of 2 × 2 non commuting matrices and it will characterize those that are interpolating.

3.1. The NC Pick Property. Salomon, Shalit and Shamovich proved in [13, Th. 4.7]

tohf aBtdH, ad2nhdalsetthenfcolbloewitins gNnCo-ne-ncvoemlomp,uttahtaitveis,vetrhseiosnmoaflltehste

Pick property: let NC set containing

 

be a that

subset is also

closed under left intertwiners:

W  nc = P -1W P  nc.

Suppose f0 :   M1 is an NC function that extends to an NC function on nc and suppose that the map

R0 : span{KW (u, v) | W  }  span{KW (u, v) | W  }

such that, for any W in (n), R0(KW (u, v)) = KW (u, f0(W )v)

u, v  Cn

is a contraction. Then f0 extends to a contractive multiplier on Bd, that is, there exists a function f in Hd whose norm doesn't exceed 1 such that f| = f0. With this in mind we can partially extend Theorem 2.6 to this non-commutative setting, and prove Theorem 1.14:

Theorem 3.1. Let Z = (Zn)nN be a sequence in Bd. The following are equivalent:
(i): Z is interpolating; (ii): For any bounded (wn)nN in C there exists a function  in Hd such that

(3.1)

(Zn) = wn Id n  N;

(iii): The sequence (Hn)nN defined in (1.22) is a Riesz System.

Proof. The implication (i) = (ii) (ii) = (iii) follows from Theorem

is trivial, 1.7, since

afsorcoannsytanitnfuHndctisoantsisbfyeilnogng(3t.o1)Htdhe.

Moreover, restriction

of M to span{Hn | n  N} is a bounded linear operator that acts like wn Id on each Hn.

To conclude, it suffices to show then that (iii) = (i). To do so, let (n)nN be a bounded sequence in Hd. There exists an NC function 0 : Znc  M1 such that

0(Zn) = n(Zn) n  N,

since each n respects direct sums and left intertwiners. Since (n)nN is bounded, so is the sequence of operator norms (||Rn||)nN, where

Rn := (Mn )|Hn

is the linear map from Hn to itself such that

Rn(KZn (u, v)) = KZn (u, n(Zn)v) = KZn(u, 0(Zn)v).

Thanks to Theorem 1.7, the map R0 from span{Hn | n  N} to itself such that R0(KZn (u, v)) = KZn(u, 0(Zn)v)

INTERPOLATING d-TUPLES OF MATRICES

23

is bounded, and by the NC Pick property there exists a multiplier  in Hd such that (Zn) = 0(Zn) = n(Zn) n  N,
concluding the proof.

As for the commuting case, we would like to point out how the a-priori weaker interpolation property in (ii) is in fact equivalent for Z to be interpolating.

Theorem 1.14 is not the only main consequence of the NC Pick property of the NC Drury-Arveson space. Indeed, since the existence of a function  in Hd of norm M separating two points in Bd
(Z) = Id (W ) = 0

is equivalent to the operator R : span{HW , HZ}  span{HW , HZ } such that

being bounded by M , one has that the Gleason NC distance between Z and W coincide with the sine of the angle between HZ and HW in the Hilbert space Hd2:

NC (Z, W ) = sin(HZ , HW ).

As a consequence, (1.24) can be re-written as

sin(Hn, span{Hj}) > 0,

j=n

and Theorem 1.15 follows from Theorem 1.14 and Proposition 2.7.

3.2. An Example. We give here an example of an interpolating sequence of pairs of non-
commuting matrices. Let (n)nN and (n)nN be two sequences of non-zero complex numbers, and define the sequence (Zn)nN in M2 as

Zn1 :=

0 0

n 0

Zn2 :=

0 n

0 0

n  N.

Then Zn1 and Zn2 do not commute for any n in N, and since

Zn1(Zn1) + Zn2(Zn2) =

|n|2 0

0 |n|2

we have that Z belongs to B2 if and only if any (n, n) belongs to the bi-disc D2. We claim that a separation condition on the sequence (n, n)nN encodes all the cases in which Z is an NC interpolating sequence:

Theorem 3.2. Z is interpolating if and only if (nn)nN is interpolating in D.

Thanks to Theorem 3.1, we need to study separation conditions of the subspaces (Hn)nN of H22, and according to (1.23) this is equivalent to studying the NC kernel functions of the form (KZn (un, vn))nN, for any sequence (un)nN and (vn)nN in C2. Observe that
(Zni )2 = 0 n  N, i = 1, 2 and therefore, out of all the coefficients of the NC function

where {e1, e2} is the standard basis of C2.

Proof of Theorem 3.2. The sequence (K^n(e1, e1))nN of normalized NC kernels can be unitarily identified with a multiple of the sequence (snn)nN of Szegö kernels at the points of (nn)nN in D. Thus if (nn)nN is not interpolating, the sequence (s^nn )nN is not a Reisz system, and therefore (K^n(e1, e1))nN is not a Riesz system either. Hence, thanks to Theorem 3.1, Z is not interpolating. Conversely, assume that (nn)nN is an interpolating sequences in D or, equivalently, that the associated sequence (s^nn)nN of Szegö kernels in H2 is a Riesz system. Both the sequences (K^Zn (e1, e1))nN and (K^Zn (e2, e2)) are untarly equivalent to (s^nn)nN in H2, and hence are Riesz systems. The same holds for (K^Zn (e1, e2))nN and (K^zn (e2, e1))nN, since they are both unitarly equivalent to a multiple of the sequence of shifted Szegö kernels (zsnn )nN. Since the four sequences
(KZn (um, uj ))nN m, j = 1, 2
are pairwise orthogonal in H22, we can conclude that the sequence of subspaces
Hn = {KZn (un, vn) | un, vn  C2} n  N

is a Riesz system in H22, thanks to Lemma 3.3 below.

Lemma 3.3. Let m be a finite positive integer, and let Xi := (xin)nN, i = 1, . . . , m be m pairwise orthogonal sequences in a Hilbert space H. If each Xi is a Riesz system, then so is the sequence X = (xn)nN defined as

xn := x1n + · · · + xmn n  N.

Proof. Without loss of generality, assume that ||xn|| = 1 for any n in N. Thus xn = t1nx^1n + · · · + tmn x^mn ,

where thanks to orthogonality
