## Abstract

As a consequence of the classification of finite simple groups, the classification of permutation groups of prime degree is complete, apart from the question of when the natural degree $(q^n-1)/(q-1)$ of ${\rm PSL}_n(q)$ is prime. We present heuristic arguments and computational evidence based on the Bateman--Horn Conjecture to support a conjecture that for each prime $n\ge 3$ there are infinitely many primes of this form, even if one restricts to prime values of $q$.
