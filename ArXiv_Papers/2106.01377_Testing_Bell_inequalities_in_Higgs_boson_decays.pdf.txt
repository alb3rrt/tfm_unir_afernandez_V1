Higgs boson decays produce pairs of W bosons in a maximally entangled state, the spins of which can be expected to violate Bell inequalities. We show that the spin density matrix of the W ± pair may be reconstructed experimentally from the directions of the emitted leptons, and from it the expectation values of various Bell operators determined. Simulations of H  W +W - indicate that violation of the CHSH inequality is unlikely to be measurable, however the CGLMP inequality is near-maximally violated, with large statistical significances which might be observable even with existing LHC data.

I. INTRODUCTION

The predictions of quantum mechanics for entangled particles have long been known to violate inequalities of the type first introduced by Bell [1]. Violations of such inequalities are expected in quantum theory but are incompatible both with classical physics and with any other theory which relies on local realism. Experimental tests showing such violation have been for pairs of two-outcome measurements using photons [2, 3], ions [4], superconducting systems [5] and nitrogen vacancy centres [6], and in pairs of three-outcome measurements using photons [7]. Proposals have also been made to test Bell inequalities in e+e- collisions [8] and positronium decays [9]. Recently it was proposed to make such tests in entangled t + t¯ decays at the LHC [10].
The decay H  W +W - is that of a scalar to a pair of distinguishable spin-1 bosons in a maximally entangled state. In the narrow width and non-relativistic approximations the state may be represented in the spin basis as

|s

= 1

|+ |-

+ |0 |0

+ |- |+

.

The subsequent W boson decays maximally violate chirality; a W + boson preferentially emits a positron along its spin direction while a W - boson preferentially emits an electron against the spin direction. Decaying W bosons are "their own polarimeters" [8]. This results in correlations in the azimuthal directions of the emitted leptons ±  {e±, µ±} which were exploited by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations to separate Higgs decays from W +W - backgrounds in their Higgs boson searches [11, 12].
Moreover, measurements of the emitted lepton directions over an ensemble of decays allow one to determine the two-particle spin density matrix , and from it the expectation values tr(B) of various quantum Bell operators B [13]. One can therefore go further and use H  W +W - boson decays as a laboratory to perform tests of Bell inequalities.
Like similar proposals using the weak decay to analyse spin [8, 10] they do not allow one to freely choose the polarisation basis, and so they are indirect tests. Never-

theless they offer an opportunity to test Bell inequalities
in a new regime: at energies of order mH  115 GeV and length scales of order c/W  10-16 m.

II. TESTING THE CHSH INEQUALITY

For a pair of two-outcome experiments, such as mea-

spin-

particles,

the tightest Bell inequality is that of Clauser-Horne-

Shimony-Holt (CHSH) [14]

I2 = E(a, b) - E(a, b ) + E(a , b) + E(a , b )  2 . (2)

This equation characterises the results of experiments performed on each of the systems, labelled A and B respectively, where the primes indicate the results obtained from alternative versions of the experiment, for example by changing the axis of a spin measurement. For twooutcome measurements the expectation values E are the products of the assigned values, either +1 or -1. For vector bosons we also have a third possibility for the value assigned for each of the paired measurements ­ the outcome of zero. This additional outcome dilutes the expectation values and so tends to decrease violation of inequality (2).
If one demands a local realistic description of nature then the values of I2 can be no larger than two, since a larger value would imply negative marginal probabilities. However quantum mechanicsallows values of I2 up to the Cirel'son bound [15] of 2 2.
Inequality (2) may be tested in quantum mechanics by using the CHSH operator, which for a pair of entangled spin-1 particles may be written

BCHSH = n^1 · S  (n^2 - n^4) · S + n^3 · S  (n^2 + n^4) · S , (3)
where n^1, n^2, n^3 and n^4 are unit vectors in R3 and S  (Sx, Sy, Sz) are the dimension-3 Hermitian spin operators. When an explicit matrix representation is required we use the standard representation i.e. with Sz = diag(+1, 0, -1).
To calculate the expectation value

I2QM = tr(BCHSH),

(4)

we note that the density matrix  for a single spin-1 particle may be parameterised by

aiSi +

cij S{ij},

(5)

i=1

i,j=1

where we denote the anticommutator

S{ij}  SiSj + Sj Si,
and where the parameters ai form a real vector and cij a traceless real symmetric matrix.
The two-particle spin density matrix  may similarly be parameterised in terms of the Si and S{ij} for each particle. Noting that the Si are each trace orthogonal with the identity and with each of the S{ij}, and that the spin operators of each particle commute with those of the other, the only terms in  contributing to the CHSH expectation value (4) are of the form

3



1 4

dij

Si

 Sj,

(6)

i,j=1

where dij are real parameters which contribute to the CHSH expectation value through terms of the form

tr(Si  Sj) = dij.

(7)

The CHSH inequality for a pair of spin-one particles therefore can be reduced to

|n^1 · d · (n^2 - n^4) + n^3 · d · (n^2 + n^4)|  2. (8)

In order to test the CHSH inequality one needs to determine the elements dij of the matrix d and to choose four unit vectors that maximise the left hand side of (8). In practice not all choices need be made, since a procedure for testing the inequality in general has been obtained for the spin-half case [16], and remains valid for a pair of spin-one particles.
Starting from the real matrix d and its transpose dT one forms the real symmetric positive matrix M  dT d. One orders the three eigenvalues µ1, µ2, µ3 of M such that µ1 > µ2 > µ3. The spin density matrix violates the inequality (8) if and only if the sum CHSH of the two largest eigenvalues is strictly larger than unity. That means we may rewrite the CHSH inequality in the form

CHSH  µ1 + µ2  1.

(9)

for pairs of three-outcome systems is the Collins-GisinLinden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) inequality [18, 19].
To construct it one again considers two observers A and B, each having two measurement settings, A1 and A2 for A, and B1 and B2 for B, but with each experiment now having three possible outcomes. One denotes by P (Ai = Bj + k) the probability that the outcomes Ai and Bj differ by k modulo 3. One then constructs the linear function

I3 = P (A1 = B1) + P (B1 = A2 + 1) + P (A2 = B2) + P (B2 = A1) - P (A1 = B1 - 1) - P (B1 = A2) - P (A2 = B2 - 1) - P (B2 = A1 - 1). (10)

In classical theories, and other theories admitting local reality, this function is bounded by [19]

I3  2.

To test inequality (11) in quantum mechanics we can calculate the expectation value of the Bell operator,

BCxyGLMP

=

2 3

(Sx

+ Sy

 Sy)

+ 4  4 + 5  5, (12)

where i is the ith of the eight traceless 3 × 3 Hermitian Gell-Mann matrices in the standard representation [20].
In this convention the spin operators Sx and Sy are given by

Sx

=

1 2

(1

+ 6)

and

Sy

=

(2

Our operator (12) is related to the standard CGLMP operator BCxGyLMP [21] through the transformation [25]
BCxyGLMP = (P(1 3)  I3)BCxGyLMP(P(1 3)  I3), (13)

where P(1 3) is the permutation operator. This procedure has the same effect as mapping our singlet state (1) into
the computational basis:

IV. DETERMINING EXPECTATION VALUES FROM DATA

III. TESTING THE CGLMP INEQUALITY
While the CHSH inequality (2) is the optimal test of local realism for a pair of two-outcome experiments, such as a pair of spin-half particles, when a third outcome is added e.g. for a pair of spin-1 particles, tighter inequalities can be formed. The optimal [17] Bell inequality

We wish to determine the expectation value tr(B) of the two different Bell operators B from H  W +W - decay data. We may do so by finding the density matrix  using as data the directions n^ + and n^ - of the emitted leptons. Exploiting the trace orthogonality relations

tr(ij) = 2ij,

(14)

we now parameterise the density matrix for the W +W - spins in the Gell-Mann basis

for a single W + or W - boson, where the i are real coefficients. The probability density function for emission for a W ± boson with spin density matrix given by (16) to emit a charged lepton ± into infinitesimal solid angle
d in the direction n^(, ) is

p(

=

tr(W ±,n^ ),

(17)

where ±,n^ are |±n^ projection operators, the roles of which are to select negative helicity leptons and positive
helicity anti-leptons in the direction n^. The normalisation is such that d p( ±n^ ; W ) = 1.
Using (17) we may obtain information about the expec-
tation values of the density matrix parameters i from angular integrals. In particular

x± av = d p( ±n^ ; W ) sin  cos

where the direction cosines i+ = n^i·n^ + and j- = n^j ·n^ - are measured in the rest frames of the W + and W -
bosons respectively. Equations (18)­(20) allow us to de-
termine the expectation values

tr(W Si) = ±2 i± av

of the single-particle spin operators from the data. Extending the calculation to the two-particle density
matrix we can calculate the expectation values of the operators required for the CHSH inequality in terms of observables [26]:

tr(Si  Sj) = -4

i-j+

.
av

(21)

In the absence of experimental cuts, and provided the sample of events is sufficiently large [27], the elements of d in (6) are therefore given by

dij = -4

i+j-

,
av

(22)

from which we may calculate the CHSH inequality (8) for any measurement angles.

(23)

The terms in the second and third parentheses come from Sx  Sx and Sy  Sy operators respectively so can be determined using (21).
To determine the remaining terms we return to the single-particle density matrix (16), and note that the angular integrals

(x±)2 - (y±)2 av = d p( ±n^ ; W ) sin2  cos(2)

Extending (26) to the two-particle density matrix, the CGLMP expectation value can be expressed

(27)

in terms of the x- and y-direction cosines of the lepton emission directions in the respective W ± boson rest frames. Similar operators and expectation values can also be constructed in other planes, any of which may be tested using the CGLMP inequality. Rather than testing every plane here we construct expectation values for the xy, yz and xz planes and compare the largest of them

I3xyz = max ( BCxyGLMP , BCyzGLMP , BCzxGLMP ) (28)

to the classical bound (11).

V. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

We performed numerical simulations of gg  H  + -¯ events, where  {e, µ}, using the Madgraph v2.9.2 software which includes full spin correlation and Breit-Wigner effects. A sample of 106 events was gener-
ated at a proton-proton centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV,
at which the gg  H cross section for a 125 GeV Higgs boson is 48.6 pb [22]. The branching ratio to e±µ±¯ is 1.055 × 10-2 [22], so our sample of 106 events corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1950 fb-1. The
results were then scaled to the target integrated luminosity of 140 fb-1, approximately that recorded by each
of the ATLAS and CMS experiments during the period 2015­2018. Events containing an e+e- or µ+µ- pair
were rejected in order to remove H  ZZ contributions.
In a real experiment corrections would be required to
Eqs. (22) and (27) to account for detector acceptance and
efficiency effects, for backgrounds, and for indetermina-
cies in the reconstructed W bosons' rest frames. The
appropriate corrections, which may be determined from
simulation, will vary from experiment to experiment and
lie beyond the scope of the present paper.
Our choice of orthonormal basis for the matrix d is a
modification of that proposed for measuring spin correlation in top quarks [23]. In the W +W - centre-of-mass frame the direction of the W + is denoted k^. The direction p^ of one of the beams in that frame is determined,
and a mutually orthogonal basis constructed from them:

k^,

^r

=

1 (p^

-

yk^),

n^

=

1 (p^

×

k^),

r

r

where y = p^ · k^ and r = 1 - y2. The right-handed orthonormal basis {n^, ^r, k^} is defined in the Higgs bo-
son rest frame. Boosts are then performed into each of the W ± rest frames, and a new basis {n^, ^r, k^ } defined
in each such that n^ and ^r are unmodified and the corresponding k^ completes the right-handed orthonormal
basis. The correlation matrix d is then constructed ac-
cording to (22), and the CGLMP expectation values ac-
cording to (27) and (28).
Since mH < 2mW , at least one of the W bosons must be off its mass-shell, and therefore can be expected to
have some scalar component. This component will be-
have like noise, reducing the observed correlations, so we
might expect the degree of the observed correlations in
the simulation to depend on the range of the W boson masses accepted. The values of CHSH and I3xyz were therefore determined for several different selections, each
being defined by the veto on same-flavour leptons and a lower bound m<W on the smaller of the masses of the two reconstructed W bosons.
The results in Table I show that as m<W is increased, and the W bosons approach their mass shell, the value of
CHSH approaches unity. However that classical limit is not exceeded so no violation of local realism is expected

to be observed through the CHSH inequality. These findings are consistent with analytical and numerical results performed previously for entangled states of relativistic spin-1 bosons in the narrow width approximation [24].
The results for the CGLMP inequality are also shown in Table I. In this case the expectation values for all values of m<W are well in excess of the classical limit of 2, and as large as 2.82. This is close to the largest possible value in quantum mechanics for a maximally entangled state which is 4/(6 3 - 9)  2.8729 [28].

TABLE I: Results of simulated tests of the CHSH and CGLMP inequalities in H  W +W - decays. Results are
shown as a function of the minimum invariant mass of the W bosons. The first row shows the fraction of the H  + -¯
events passing the selection, including the same-family lep-
ton veto. The final row shows, for an integrated luminosity of 140 fb-1, the statistical significance by which the CGLMP
expectation value exceeds the classical limit of 2.

The statistical significances by which the simulated values of I3xyz exceed the classical bound were calculated for integrated luminosity of 140 fb-1, and were up to 12.7. In a real experiment the sensitivity will be reduced due to backgrounds, selection cuts, and efficiency and acceptance corrections. Nevertheless violation of the CGLMP Bell inequality might be possible at the LHC experiments even with existing data.

VI. CONCLUSION
We have outlined methods by which two Bell inequalities -- the CHSH and CGLMP inequalities -- may be tested experimentally in H  W +W - decays, using the spin-analysing nature of the weak decays. Numerical simulations, agreeing with previous analytical and numerical work for pairs of spin-1 bosons, suggest that one cannot expect to observe violation of the CHSH inequality in this process.
By contrast the CGLMP inequality, the tightest inequality for pairs of three-state systems, is expected to be near-maximally violated in H  W +W - decays. Statistically significant violations of the CGLMP inequality might therefore be observable by the LHC experiments using data already collected.

[25] A similar permutation operation is also required in principal for the CHSH operator, but has no net effect on the final result after the process of optimisation over measurement directions. [26] We note that the factor of 4 in (21) differs from a factor of 9 which would be obtained in the spin-half case. [27] Care is necessary in evaluating CHSH when event samples become very small, due to the procedure of maximising over the choice of axes. In the limit where only a single event satisfies the selection requirements there exists a choice of axes for which i+ = j- = 1, and so the inferred value of CHSH would be 42 = 16. [28] See Ref. [19]. A slightly larger extremal value of
1 + 11/3  2.9149 can achieved for other states that are not maximally entangled [21].
