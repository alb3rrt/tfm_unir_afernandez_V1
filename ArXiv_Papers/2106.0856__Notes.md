## Abstract

Since our goal is to recognize the input speech, we consider enhancements which improve word error rates (WERs) when the predicted speech signal is passed to an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model. First, we augment the loss function with a term that produces outputs useful to a pre-trained ASR model and show that this augmented loss function improves WER metrics. Second, we demonstrate that augmenting our training dataset of real world examples with a large synthetic dataset improves performance. Crucially, applying SpecAugment style masks to the reference channel during training aids the model in adapting from synthetic to real domains. In experimental evaluations, we find the proposed approaches improve performance, on average, by 57% over a signal processing baseline and 45% over the neural AEC model without the proposed changes.
