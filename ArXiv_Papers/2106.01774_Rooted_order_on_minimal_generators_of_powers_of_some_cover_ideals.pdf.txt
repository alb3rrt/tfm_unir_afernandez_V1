ROOTED ORDER ON MINIMAL GENERATORS OF POWERS OF SOME COVER IDEALS
NURSEL EREY
Abstract. We define a total order, which we call rooted order, on minimal generating set of J(Pn)s where J(Pn) is the cover ideal of a path graph on n vertices. We show that each power of a cover ideal of a path has linear quotients with respect to the rooted order. Along the way, we characterize minimal generating set of J(Pn)s for s  3 in terms of minimal generating set of J(Pn)2. We also discuss the extension of the concept of rooted order to chordal graphs. Computational examples suggest that such order gives linear quotients for powers of cover ideals of chordal graphs as well.

1. Introduction

Let S = k[x1, . . . , xn] be the polynomial ring over a field k and let G be a finite simple graph with vertex set V (G) = {x1, . . . , xn} and edge set E(G). The cover ideal of G is a squarefree monomial ideal of S defined by

J(G) =

(xi, xj).

{xi,xj }E(G)

The cover ideal J(G) is the Alexander dual of the well-known edge ideal of G. Cover ideals and their powers were studied in many articles, see for example [2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 19, 20, 21] Herzog, Hibi and Ohsugi [15] showed that if G is a Cohen-Macaulay chordal graph, then all powers of the cover ideal of G have linear resolutions. Moreover, they proposed the following conjecture:

Conjecture 1.1. [15, Conjecture 2.5] All powers of the vertex cover ideal of a chordal graph are componentwise linear.

Francisco and Van Tuyl [9] showed that cover ideals of chordal graphs are componentwise linear. For a graded ideal I  S, being componentwise linear is an algebraic property which requires that for all j, the ideal I j , generated by all homogeneous polynomials of degree j belonging to I, has a linear resolution. Later, it was proved that chordal graphs in fact have stronger combinatorial properties such as being shellable [22] and vertex decomposable [23]. In [20] it was proved that powers of cover ideals of Cohen-Macaulay chordal graphs have linear quotients. A graph G is called Cohen-Macaulay if the quotient ring S/I(G) is Cohen-Macaulay, where I(G)
denotes the edge ideal of G. It is well-known [13, Lemma 9.1.10] that the cover ideal

of a Cohen-Macaulay graph is generated in single degree. Since cover ideal of a path graph can have minimal generators of different degrees, paths are not necessarily Cohen-Macaulay. In fact, using the recursive description of the minimal generating set of J(Pn) in Lemma 2.2, one can show that Pn is not Cohen-Macaulay for n  5.
In a recent preprint [19] Kumar and Kumar proved Conjecture 1.1 for all trees. Their main tool is a result from [8] which says that for any graph G the polarization of kth symbolic power of J(G) is the cover ideal of some graph denoted by Gk. Since symbolic powers and ordinary powers of cover ideal of bipartite graphs coincide
[11], their approach is to show that Gk is vertex decomposable when G is a tree. Although trees contain the class of path graphs, the methods in [19] cannot be applied to non-bipartite chordal graphs.
The main goal of this paper is to make a contribution to the problem in Conjec-
ture 1.1 and bring up an idea that is applicable to all chordal graphs. We introduce the notion of rooted order (Definition 2.7 and Definition 5.5) and we show that all powers of the cover ideal of a path graph have linear quotients with respect to such order (Theorem 4.3). Our results build on and extend the analogous results presented in [6] from second powers to all powers. We analyze the minimal generating
set of J(Pn)s in relation to rooted order. An interesting byproduct we obtain in the process is Corollary 3.12 which characterizes the minimal generators of J(Pn)s for s  3 in terms of those of the second power. Although we focus on the class of path graphs, the notion of rooted order naturally generalizes to chordal graphs. In fact,
examples we tested on chordal graphs led us to question if one can always find a rooted order which gives linear quotients for powers of their cover ideals. We discuss this in Section 5 and we think that the techniques developed in this article may be helpful to further explore the problem at hand in a more general framework.

2. Preliminaries

Let S = k[x1, . . . , xn] be the polynomial ring over a field k and let I be a monomial ideal. We denote the set of minimal generators of I by G(I). We say I has linear

quotients if there exists an order u1, . . . , uk on the elements of G(I) such that for every i = 2, . . . , k the colon ideal (u1, . . . , ui-1) : (ui) is generated by some variables. To simplify our notation, for any pair of monomials u and v we will write

u

:

v

=

u gcd(u,

v)

.

If M is a subset of S and u is a monomial, then we define a new subset uM by

uM = {um : m  M}. Similarly, if L = v1, . . . , vt is a list (or sequence) of monomials, then uL denotes a new list obtained from L by multiplying each term by u. In other words,

uL = uv1, . . . , uvt.
To keep our notation simple and also to distinguish lists from ideals we will not put parentheses around lists.
Let G be a finite simple graph with vertex set V (G) = {x1, . . . , xn} and edge set E(G). A set C of vertices of G is called a vertex cover if e  C =  for every edge
2

e  E(G). A vertex cover C is called minimal if no proper subset of C forms a vertex cover for G. The cover ideal of G is denoted by J(G) and it is defined by

J(G) =

(xi, xj).

{xi,xj }E(G)

The set of minimal generators of J(G) is given by

G(J(G)) = {xi1 . . . xik : {xi1, . . . , xik} is a minimal vertex cover of G}.
If the graph G has no edges, then J(G) = (1). If A is a subset of vertices of G, then G \ A denotes the graph which is obtained
from G by removing the vertices in A. We call a graph chordal if it has no induced cycle of length greater than 3. We say xi is a neighbor of xj if {xi, xj}  E(G). The set of all neighbors of xi is denoted by N (xi). The closed neighborhood of xi is denoted by N [xi] and it is equal to the union N (xi)  {xi}. Every chordal graph has a vertex whose closed neighbourhood induces a complete graph and such vertex is called a simplicial vertex.
A path on vertices x1, . . . , xn is denoted by Pn. Throughout the paper we will assume that edges of Pn are labelled as

E(G) = {{x1, x2}, {x2, x3}, . . . , {xn-1, xn}}.

Definition 2.1 (Rooted list). [6, Definition 2.2 ] The rooted list of Pn, denoted by R(Pn), is recursively defined by the following formulas:
· R(P1) = 1 · R(P2) = x1, x2 · R(P3) = x2, x1x3 · for n  4, if R(Pn-2) = u1, . . . , ur and R(Pn-3) = v1, . . . , vs then

R(Pn) = xn-1u1, . . . , xn-1ur, xnxn-2v1, . . . , xnxn-2vs.

The motivation for this definition is the next lemma.

Lemma 2.2. Let R(Pn) = u1, . . . , uq. Then (1) G(J(Pn)) = {u1, . . . , uq} (2) J(Pn) has linear quotients with respect to u1, . . . , uq.
Proof. Follows from [6, Lemma 2.1] and the recursive definition of rooted list.

Based on the lemma above, a total order on minimal generators of J(Pn) was defined.

Definition 2.3 (Rooted order). [6, Definition 2.2 ] Let R(Pn) = u1, . . . , uq. The rooted order, denoted by >R, is a total order on G(J(Pn)) such that ui >R uj when i < j.
Definition 2.4. Let u = (u1, . . . , un), v = (v1, . . . , vn) be two elements in Zn. Then we write u >lex v if the first non-zero entry in u - v is positive.
The following is a general version of Definition 2.4 in [6].

Definition 2.5 (s-fold product, maximal expression). Let I = (u1, . . . , uq). We

say that M = ua11 . . . uaqq is an s-fold product of minimal generators of I if each ai is

a non-negative integer and a1 + (a1, . . . , aq) >lex (b1, . . . , bq). We

· · · + aq say that

= s. We M = ua11

. . . uaqq >lex ub11 . . . ubqq if the maximal expression

if (a1, . . . , aq) >lex (b1, . . . , bq) for any other s-fold product M = ub11 . . . ubqq .

Notation 2.6. If G(I) = {u1, . . . , uq}, then the set of all s-fold products is denoted by F (Is) = {ui1 . . . uis : ui1, . . . , uis  G(I)}.

We also generalize Definition 2.6 in [6] from second powers to all powers.

Definition 2.7 (Rooted order/list on powers). Let R(Pn) = u1, . . . , uq. We define a total order >R on F (J(Pn)s) which we call rooted order as follows. For M, N  F (J(Pn)s) with maximal expressions M = ua11 . . . uaqq and N = ub11 . . . ubqq we set M >R N if (a1, . . . , aq) >lex (b1, . . . , bq).
Let G(J(Pn)s) = {U1, . . . , Ur}. Then we say U1, . . . , Ur is a rooted list of minimal generators of J(Pn)s if U1 >R . . . >R Ur. In such case, we denote the rooted list of generators by R(J(Pn)s) = U1, . . . , Ur. Remark 2.8. If n = 1, then R(J(Pn)s) = 1 for every s.

Remark 2.9. If n = 6, then Figure 1 is still valid if we make the convention R(P0) = 1. In this case, the lists B, C, D each has only one term:
B = xn-1xn-2xn-4, C = xnxn-2xn-4, D = xnxn-2xn-3xn-5.
3. Properties of rooted order and G(J(Pn)s)
In this section, we will establish some properties of rooted order and minimal generating set of J(Pn)s which will be useful in the sequel.
Remark 3.1. Observe that if n  2, then every minimal vertex cover of Pn contains either xn or xn-1, but not both. Therefore if U, V  F (J(Pn)s) such that U |V , then the highest power of xn (respectively xn-1) dividing U is the same as that of xn (respectively xn-1) dividing V .

Lemma 3.2. [6, Lemma 3.5] Let n  3 and let u  G(J(Pn)) such that xn|u. Then there exists v  G(J(Pn-2)) such that v divides u/xn.
Remark 3.3. Let n  4 and let R(Pn-2) = u1, . . . , um. Observe that by definition of rooted order the expression ui1 . . . uis is maximal with i1  · · ·  is if and only if (xn-1ui1) . . . (xn-1uis) is the maximal expression with xn-1ui1 R · · · R xn-1uis in R(Pn).
Remark 3.4. Let n  5 and let R(Pn-3) = u1, . . . , um. Observe that by definition of rooted order the expression ui1 . . . uis is maximal with i1  · · ·  is if and only if (xnxn-2ui1) . . . (xnxn-2uis) is the maximal expression with xnxn-2ui1 R · · · R xnxn-2uis in R(Pn).
According to recursive definition of rooted list, for n  4 each factor of an s-fold product of minimal generators of J(Pn) belongs to either xn-1R(Pn-2) or xnxn-2R(Pn-3). If all of the factors are from xn-1R(Pn-2) or all of the factors are from xnxn-2R(Pn-3), then the s-fold product is pure. Otherwise s-fold product is mixed. Now, we make some observations on pure and mixed s-fold products.
Lemma 3.5 (Pure s-fold product divisible by xsn-1). Let n  3. Then U, V  F (J(Pn-2)s) if and only if xsn-1U, xsn-1V  F (J(Pn)s). Moreover, in such case the following statements hold.
(1) U >R V if and only if xsn-1U >R xsn-1V . (2) U  G(J(Pn-2)s) if and only if xsn-1U  G(J(Pn)s).
Proof. The fist statement is clear from the definition of rooted list and Lemma 2.2. To see (1) let R(Pn-2) = u1, . . . , um. Suppose that U = ui1 . . . uis and V = uj1 . . . ujs are maximal expressions with i1  · · ·  is and j1  · · ·  js. Then by Remark 3.3 the expressions (xn-1ui1) . . . (xn-1uis) and (xn-1uj1) . . . (xn-1ujs) are maximal as well. Suppose U = V and let t be the smallest index such that it = jt. Then
U >R V  it < jt  xsn-1U >R xsn-1V as desired. For proof of (2), the direction () is straightforward and the direction () follows from Remark 3.1.
Lemma 3.6 (Pure s-fold product divisible by xsn). Let n  4. Then U, V  F (J(Pn-3)s) if and only if both xsnxsn-2U and xsnxsn-2V belong to F (J(Pn)s). Moreover, in such case the following statements hold.
(1) U >R V if and only if xsnxsn-2U >R xsnxsn-2V . (2) U  G(J (Pn-3)s) if and only if xsnxsn-2U  G(J (Pn)s)
Proof. Similar to proof of Lemma 3.5 using Remark 3.4.
Lemma 3.7 (Mixed s-fold product). Let R(Pn-2) = u1, . . . , ua and let R(Pn-3) = v1, . . . , vb for some n  4. Let U = ui1 . . . uiq , V = vj1 . . . vjk and W = xqn-1xknxkn-2U V .
(1) If W = (xn-1ui1) . . . (xn-1uiq )(xnxn-2vj1) . . . (xnxn-2vjk ) is the maximal expression in F (J (Pn)k+q) with xn-1ui1 R · · · R xn-1uiq >R xnxn-2vj1 R · · · R xnxn-2vjk , then the expression U = ui1 . . . uiq is maximal in F (J(Pn-2)q)
5

with i1  · · ·  iq and the expression V = vj1 . . . vjk is maximal in F (J(Pn-3)k) with j1  · · ·  jk. (2) If W  G(J(Pn)q+k), then U  G(J(Pn-2)q) and V  G(J(Pn-3)k).
Proof. Proof is straightforward and left to the reader.

Note that in the previous lemma, the converses of (1) and (2) are not true.
· Consider q = k = 1 and n = 7 with R(P7) = u1, . . . , u7. Then u4  x6R(P5) and u5  x7x5R(P4) but u4u5 is not the maximal expression as u3u6 = u4u5. Thus the converse of (1) is not true.
· Consider q = k = 1 and n = 5. Then U = x1x3  G(J(P3)) and V = x2  G(J(P2)) but (x4U )(x3x5V ) / G(J(P5)2). Thus the converse of (2) is not true.

3.1. Reduction to second powers. In this section we will reduce the problem of
describing minimal generating set of J(Pn)s to the case when s = 2. To this end, first we will explicitly describe G(J(Pn)s) for some small values of n. These results will then form the basis step of inductive proof of Theorem 3.11 which will be our
next goal.

Lemma 3.8. If 2  n  4, then G(J(Pn)s) = F (J(Pn)s) for all s. Moreover, in that case every U  F (J(Pn)s) has a unique expression as an s-fold product of minimal generators of J(Pn).
Proof. Case 1: Suppose n = 2 or n = 3. Then R(Pn) = u1, u2 where xn-1 divides u1 and xn divides u2. Let V = u1 u2 be an s-fold product which divisible by another s-fold product U = ua1ub2. Since the exponents of xn in U and V are respectively b and  it follows from Remark 3.1 that b = . Similarly, since the exponents of xn-1 are equal we get a =  and U = V .
Case 2: Suppose n = 4. Then R(P4) = u1, u2, u3 where u1 = x1x3, u2 = x2x3, u3 = x2x4. Let U = ua1ub2uc3 and V = u1 u2 u3 be s-fold products such that U divides V . Remark 3.1 implies that c =  and a + b =  + . Since the exponents of x1 in U and V are respectively a and  it follows that a  . Similarly, comparing exponents of x2 we get b  . Thus a = , b =  and U = V .
Lemma 3.9. Let R(P5) = u1, u2, u3, u4. If U = u1 u2 u3u4  F (J(P5)s) \ G(J(P5)s), then ,  > 0.

Proof. Let u1 = x2x4, u2 = x1x3x4, u3 = x1x3x5, u4 = x2x3x5. Let V = ua1ub2uc3ud4  G(J(P5)s) such that V |U. First note that by Remark 3.1 we have

(3.1)

a + b =  +  and c + d =  + .

Moreover, since the degree of V is less than degree of U we have

(3.2)

2a + 3b + 3c + 3d < 2 + 3 + 3 + 3.

Combining (3.1) and (3.2) we obtain b <  and thus  > 0. Then we get a > . Comparing the exponents of x2 in U and V we get a + d   +  and thus  > 0.

Lemma 3.10. Let R(Pn) = u1, . . . , ur with n  2 and let s  2.
6

(1) If ui1 . . . uis  G(J(Pn)s), then upuq  G(J(Pn)2) for all p, q  {i1, . . . , is}. (2) If ui1 . . . uis is the maximal expression for some i1  · · ·  is, then for all
p, q  {i1, . . . , is} with p < q the expression upuq is maximal.
Proof. To see (1) assume for a contradiction ui1 . . . uis  G(J(Pn)s) but there exist p, q  {i1, . . . , is} such that upuq / G(J(Pn)2). Then there exists upuq  G(J(Pn)2) which strictly divides upuq. Then ui1 . . . uisupuq/(upuq) is an s-fold product and it strictly divides ui1 . . . uis, contradicting our initial assumption. Proof of (2) is similar.
Theorem 3.11. Let G(J(Pn)) = {u1, . . . , ur} with n  2 and s  2. Let U = ua11 . . . uarr be an s-fold product in F (J(Pn)s). If U / G(J(Pn)s), then there exist p and q with ap, aq > 0 such that upuq / G(J(Pn)2).
Proof. We use induction on n. Suppose that U / G(J(Pn)s). If n  4, then the statement is vacuously true by Lemma 3.8. If n = 5, then u1u3 strictly divides u2u4 and the statement is true by Lemma 3.9. Therefore let us assume that n  6.
Keeping Figure 1 in mind, observe that if xsn-1 divides U, then the result follows from Lemma 3.5 and the induction assumption on Pn-2. Similarly, if xsn divides U, then the result follows from Lemma 3.6 and the induction assumption on Pn-3. Therefore, let us assume that U is divisible by xnxn-1.
If there exist p and q with ap, aq > 0 such that xn-4xn-1|up and xn-3xn|uq, then the result follows from [6, Lemma 4.1]. Therefore, it suffices to consider the following cases:
Case 1: Suppose that U is product of factors from A, B, C in Figure 1 such that at least one factor from A or B is divisible by xn-4. Then we can write
U = (xn-1xn-3)V (xn-1xn-2xn-4)W (xnxn-2xn-4)Y
for some V  F (J(Pn-4)), W  F (J(Pn-5)), Y  F (J(Pn-5)). Let U   G(J(Pn)s) such that U strictly divides U. Keeping Remark 2.9 in mind, suppose that
U  = (xn-1xn-3) V (xn-1xn-2xn-4) W (xnxn-2xn-4) Y (xnxn-2xn-3xn-5) Z
for some V   F (J (Pn-4) ), W   F (J (Pn-5) ), Y   F (J (Pn-5)), Z  F (J (Pn-6) ). We claim that
(, , , 0) = (, , , ). By Remark 3.1 we have  +  =  +  and  =  + . Since the exponent of xn-2 in U is less than or equal to that of U we have
 +    +  + .
Similarly, since the exponent of xn-3 in U is less than or equal to that of U we have
   + .
Then adding up the inequalities we get  = 0. Then  =  +  implies  = . Therefore  =  and  =  as desired.
7

Therefore, V W Y  strictly divides V W Y . By recursive definition of R(Pn-2) (see Figure 2) observe that
U  = xn-3V (xn-2xn-4)W (xn-2xn-4)Y  F (J (Pn-2)s) \ G(J (Pn-2)s). Then by induction assumption on Pn-2, one of V, W or Y contains a non-minimal 2-fold product. By adding the suitable variables, one can see that U satisfies the desired condition.
Case 2: Suppose that U is product of factors from A, C, D such that no factor from A is divisible by xn-4. Then we can write
U = (xn-1xn-3)µV (xnxn-2) X for some V  F (J(Pn-4)µ), X  F (J(Pn-3)), where µ,  > 0 and µ +  = s. We claim that U is divisible by some U  G(J(Pn)s) of the same form. Indeed, if
U  = (xn-1xn-3)µ V (xn-1xn-2xn-4) W (xnxn-2) X 
for some V   F (J (Pn-4)µ), W   F (J (Pn-5)) and X  F (J (Pn-3)), then we must have µ +  = µ and  =  by Remark 3.1. Then comparing the exponents of xn-2 in U and U  we see that  = 0.
Therefore, V X strictly divides V X. Then by recursive definition of R(Pn-1) observe that
U  = xn-2X(xn-1xn-3)µV  F (J (Pn-1)s) \ G(J (Pn-1)s). Then by induction assumption on Pn-1, either V or X contains a non-minimal 2-fold product. By adding the suitable variables, one can see that U satisfies the desired condition.

As a consequence of Theorem 3.11 we characterize minimal generating set of J(Pn)s for s  3 in terms of minimal generating set of second power of J(Pn).
Corollary 3.12. Let G(J(Pn)) = {u1, . . . , ur} and let s  2. The following statements are equivalent.
(1) ui1 . . . uis  G(J (Pn)s). (2) upuq  G(J(Pn)2) for all p, q  {i1, . . . , is}.
Proof. Immediate from Lemma 3.10 and Theorem 3.11.

Given a monomial ideal I, let µ(I) denote the cardinality of G(I). If G(I) =

{u1, . . . , uq}, then by counting the number of s-element multi-subsets of [q] =

{1, . . . , q} one can see that µ(Is) 

q+s-1 q-1

.

This

upper

bound

may

not be achieved

in general for two reasons. Firstly, a product of the form ui1 . . . uis may be equal to

another product uj1 . . . ujs with {i1, . . . , is} = {j1, . . . , js} as multi-sets. Secondly,

ui1 . . . uis may be strictly divisible by another product uj1 . . . ujs. In fact, when I is

generated by monomials of the same degrees, the latter cannot happen. Therefore,

although the computation of µ(Is) is a challenging problem, one can describe the

set G(Is) explicitly when I is generated in the same degree. On the other hand,

when I is not generated in the same degree, description of G(Is) remains a difficult

problem as well as computation of µ(Is).

It is well-known ([18]) that the function g(s) = µ(Is) is a polynomial in s for s  0.

In [4], the authors addressed the question of how small µ(I2) can be in terms of µ(I)

when I is a monomial ideal in polynomial ring with n = 2 variables. Behaviour of

µ(Is) was considered in some other articles, see for example [1, 10, 16, 17]. Recently,

Drabkin and Guerrieri [3] studied Freiman cover ideals. Given a cover ideal J(G),

it is a demanding task to find the minimal generating set of J(G)s or µ(J(G)s).

Therefore, Corollary 3.12 might be of interest in computation of µ(J(Pn)s). We will next see how Theorem 3.11 will be useful to extend the following result

to all powers of J(Pn).

Lemma 3.13. [6, Lemma 4.5] Let U  F (J(Pn)2) \ G(J(Pn)2). Then there exists V  G(J(Pn)2) such that V >R U and V |U .

Lemma 3.14. Let U  F (J(Pn)s) \ G(J(Pn)s). Then there exists V  G(J(Pn)s) such that V >R U and V |U.

Proof. Let R(Pn) = u1, . . . , up with n  2. Let U = u1 1 . . . up p be the maximal expression. By Theorem 3.11 there exists uiuj with i, j = 0 and uiuj / G(J(Pn)2). Without loss of generality assume that i  j. Note that uiuj is the maximal expression by Lemma 3.10. Then by Lemma 3.13 there exists v  G(J(Pn)2) such that v strictly divides uiuj and v >R uiuj. Let v = uku be the maximal expression with k  . Consider the s-fold product V = (U uku)/(uiuj). Observe that V >R U and V strictly divides U. If V is a minimal generator, then we are done, otherwise this
process can be repeated.

4. Linear quotients of J(Pn)s with respect to rooted order
In this section we will show that J(Pn)s has linear quotients with respect to rooted order. Before that, we prove the following result which will be crucial in the last case of proof of Theorem 4.3.
Proposition 4.1. Let R(Pn) = u1, . . . , uq and let R(J(Pn)s) = Y1, . . . , Yp. Suppose that Yr = ui1 . . . uis is the maximal expression for some 2  r  p with i1  · · ·  is.
(1) For each 1  t  s with 2  it we have
(u1, u2, . . . , uit-1) : (uit)  (Y1, . . . , Yr-1) : (Yr).
(2) If xn|Yr, then xn-1  (Y1, . . . , Yr-1) : (Yr).
9

Proof. (1): First note that by Lemma 2.2 the ideal (u1, u2, . . . , uit-1) : (uit) is generated by variables. Let  < it with u : uit = xz for some variable xz. Consider the s-fold product M = Yru/uit. Then M : Yr = xz and M >RYr. If M is a minimal generator, nothing is left to show. Otherwise, by Lemma 3.14 there exists M   G(J(Pn)s) such that M  >R M and M |M . Then since M  = Yr and M  : Yr divides M : Yr it follows that M  : Yr = xz and xz  (Y1, . . . , Yr-1) : (Yr).
(2): Suppose that xn divides uik for some k  {1, . . . , s}. Then by definition of rooted list ik  2. By part (1) it suffices to show that
xn-1  (u1, u2, . . . , uik-1) : (uik )
which is immediate from [6, Lemma 3.6].
We will also need the following result from [6].
Proposition 4.2. [6, Proposition 4.2] Let R(Pn) = u1, . . . , uk where n  2. Let 1 < i < j  k. Suppose uj contains a variable from (u1, . . . , ui-1) : (ui). Then either uiuj is not a minimal generator of J(Pn)2 or uiuj is not the maximal 2-fold expression.
We can now prove the main result of this section.
Theorem 4.3. Let R(J(Pn)s) = Y1, . . . , Yp. Then J(Pn)s has linear quotients with respect to Y1, . . . , Yp.
Proof. We will proceed by induction on n+s. We will show that (Y1, . . . , Yr-1) : (Yr) is generated by variables, for all r  2.
Basis step (n  3 or s = 1): The case when s = 1 is Lemma 2.2. If n = 2 or n = 3 with R(Pn) = u1, u2, then by Lemma 3.8 we have R(J(Pn)s) = us1, u1s-1u2, . . . , us2 and it is straightforward to show that (Y1, . . . , Yr-1) : (Yr) = (u1) : (u2) = (xn-1) holds for every r  2.
Induction step: Let us assume that n  4 and s  2. We set some notation for the following rooted lists.
· R(Pn-2) = u1, . . . , ua · R(Pn-3) = v1, . . . , vb · R(J (Pn-2)s) = U1, . . . , UA · R(J (Pn-3)s) = V1, . . . , VB. Case 1: Suppose that xsn divides Yr. Assume that Yr has the maximal expression
Yr = (xnxn-2vi1 )(xnxn-2vi2 ) . . . (xnxn-2vis )
for some i1  · · ·  is. From Proposition 4.1 (2) we know that xn-1 is a generator of (Y1, . . . , Yr-1) : (Yr). From Lemma 3.6 we can set Vt = vi1vi2 . . . vis for some t  {1, . . . , B}. If t = 1, then by definition of rooted order we have
(Y1, . . . , Yr-1) : (Yr) = (xn-1)
and nothing is left to show. Therefore let us assume that t > 1. Observe that because of induction assumption on Pn-3 it suffices to show the equality
(xn-1) + (V1, V2, . . . , Vt-1) : (Vt) = (Y1, . . . , Yr-1) : (Yr).
10

Because of Lemma 3.6 we already have the inclusion

(xn-1) + (V1, V2, . . . , Vt-1) : (Vt)  (Y1, . . . , Yr-1) : (Yr). We now prove the reverse containment. For any   r - 1, if xn-1|Y, then it is clear that Y : Yr  (xn-1). Otherwise, (xn-2xn)s|Y and by Lemma 3.6, we have Y/(xn-2xn)s = Vk for some k. Moreover, since Y >R Yr Lemma 3.6 implies that Vk >R Vt. Hence Y : Yr = Vk : Vt, proving the reverse containment.
Case 2: Suppose that xsn-1 divides Yr. Let Yr = (xn-1ui1)(xn-1ui2) . . . (xn-1uis)
be the maximal expression for some i1  · · ·  is. Then the expression ui1 . . . uis is also maximal by Remark 3.3. By Lemma 3.5 we can set Ut = ui1 . . . uis for some t > 1 as r > 1. By induction assumption on Pn-2 it suffices to show that
(U1, . . . , Ut-1) : (Ut) = (Y1, . . . , Yr-1) : (Yr). By Lemma 3.5 the inclusion  is clear. To see the reverse, let   r - 1. By definition of rooted list, Y is divisible by either xsn-1 or xn-1xn. Because of Lemma 3.5 we may assume that Y is divisible by xn-1xn. Let Y have the maximal expression
Y = (xn-1uj1) . . . (xn-1ujc)(xnxn-2vk1) . . . (xnxn-2vkd) for some 1  j1  · · ·  jc  a and 1  k1  · · ·  kd  b.
By Lemma 3.2 we can form the s-fold product

P = (xn-1uj1) . . . (xn-1ujc)(xn-1uk1 ) . . . (xn-1ukd ) where uki divides xn-2vki for each i = 1, . . . , d. By definition of >R we now have
P >R Y >R Yr in F (J (Pn)s).
Lemma 3.5 implies that

uj1 . . . ujcuk1 . . . ukd >R ui1 . . . uis in F (J (Pn-2)s). Observe that
P  G(J (Pn)s) = uj1 . . . ujcuk1 . . . ukd = Ut for some t < t by Lemma 3.5 = P : Yr  (U1, . . . , Ut-1) : (Ut) as P : Yr = Ut : Ut
= Y : Yr  (U1, . . . , Ut-1) : (Ut) as P : Yr divides Y : Yr
as desired. On the other hand, if P / G(J(Pn)s), then by Lemma 3.14, there exists Y  G(J(Pn)s) such that Y|P and Y >R P . Since Y|P it follows from Remark 3.1 that xsn-1|Y. Since Y > Yr by Lemma 3.5 we get Y : Yr  (U1, . . . , Ut-1) : (Ut). Since Y : Yr divides P : Yr and P : Yr divides Y : Yr, we have Y : Yr divides Y : Yr and Y : Yr  (U1, . . . , Ut-1) : (Ut) as desired.
Case 3: Suppose that Yr is divisible by xnxn-1 and it has the maximal expression
Yr = (xn-1ui1) . . . (xn-1uiq )(xnxn-2vj1 ) . . . (xnxn-2vjk )
for some 1  i1  · · ·  iq  a and 1  j1  · · ·  jk  b. First note that from Proposition 4.1 we have

(4.1)

xn-1  (Y1, . . . , Yr-1) : (Yr).
11

Let t < r. Since Yt >R Yr and because of (4.1) we may assume that Yt has the maximal expression

Yt = (xn-1u1) . . . (xn-1uq )(xnxn-2v1 ) . . . (xnxn-2vk )
for some 1  1  · · ·  q  a and 1  1  · · ·  k  b with q  q. We will now consider the following cases.
Case 3.1: Suppose that i =  for all  = 1, . . . , q. Then q = q since Yt >R Yr. This implies k = k. By Lemma 3.7 we get v1 . . . vk >R vj1 . . . vjk in R(J(Pn-3)k). Observe that
Yt : Yr = v1 . . . vk : vj1 . . . vjk . By the induction assumption on J(Pn-3)k there exists a variable xz such that
xz divides v1 . . . vk : vj1 . . . vjk and xz = v1 . . . vk : vj1 . . . vjk
for some v1 . . . vk >R vj1 . . . vjk in R(J(Pn-3)k). Therefore it suffices to show that
xz  (Y1, . . . , Yr-1) : (Yr).
Consider the s-fold product P = (xn-1ui1) . . . (xn-1uiq )(xnxn-2v1) . . . (xnxn-2vk ). By definition of rooted order P >R Yr. Clearly P : Yr = xz. If P  G(J(Pn)s) nothing is left to show. Otherwise, the result follows from Lemma 3.14.
Case 3.2: Suppose that there is a smallest index  among 1, . . . , q such that i = . Since Yt >R Yr we have i > . Then according to Lemma 2.2 there exists a variable in (u1, . . . , ui-1) : (ui), say xz, which divides u : ui. Note that xz = xn-2 because of recursive definition of R(Pn-2). Also, it is clear that xz = xn, xn-1 because xz is a vertex of Pn-2. From Proposition 4.1 we see that
xz  (xn-1u1, . . . , xn-1ui-1) : (xn-1ui)  (Y1, . . . , Yr-1) : (Yr)
and thus it suffices to show that xz divides Yt : Yr. From Lemma 3.10 and Proposition 4.2 we see that

xz  (xn-1ui )(xn-1ui+1) . . . (xn-1uiq )(xnxn-2vj1 ) . . . (xnxn-2vjk ). By the choice of  since ui1 . . . ui-1 = u1 . . . u-1 the result follows.

Using Theorem 4.3 one can obtain an exact formula for the regularity of powers of J(Pn) as in the next corollary.

Corollary 4.4. For any n  2 and s  1

2ks

if n = 3k + 1 or n = 3k

reg(J(Pn)s) = 2ks + s if n = 3k + 2.

Proof. Similar to proof of [6, Corollary 5.3].

5. Rooted order for chordal graphs

In this section we will see how to generalize the concept of rooted list to chordal

graphs. To simplify the notation we will use a set A of vertices of G interchangeably

with the squarefree monomial xiA xi.

Notation 5.1. L = L1, L2, . .

For . , Lr

each i = 1, . . . , r we denote a new

let list

Li be the L which is

list Li = obtained

ai1 by

,j.o.i.n,inagiki

. Then the lists

by in

the given order. More precisely,

L = a11, . . . , a1k1, a21, . . . , a2k2, · · · , ar1, . . . , arkr .
Definition 5.2 (Rooted list for chordal graphs). Suppose that G is a chordal graph with a simplicial vertex x1 such that N [x1] = {x1, . . . , xm} for some m  2. We say R(G) is a rooted list of G if it can be written in the form

R(H1)N (x1), R(H2)N (x2), . . . , R(Hm)N (xm)
where the list R(Hi) is a rooted list of the subgraph Hi = G \ N [xi] for each i = 1, . . . , m. If G has no edges, then we set R(G) = 1.

Remark 5.3. Observe that one can construct rooted lists in different ways as they depend on the choice of simplicial vertex. In Definition 2.1 we always picked the last vertex xn of Pn as a simplicial vertex.
Lemma 5.4. Let G be a chordal graph with a rooted list R(G) = u1, . . . , uq. Then (1) G(J(G)) = {u1, . . . , uq} (2) J(G) has linear quotients with respect to u1, . . . , uq.
Proof. Proof follows from [5, Theorem 3.1] and [22, Theorem 2.13].

Definition 5.5 (Rooted order/list for powers). Let G be a chordal graph with a rooted list R(G) = u1, . . . , uq. We define a total order >R on F (J(G)s) which we call rooted order as follows. For M, N  F (J(G)s) with maximal expressions M = ua11 . . . uaqq and N = ub11 . . . ubqq we set M >R N if (a1, . . . , aq) >lex (b1, . . . , bq).
Let G(J(G)s) = {U1, . . . , Ur}. Then we say U1, . . . , Ur is a rooted list of minimal generators of J(G)s if U1 >R . . . >R Ur. In such case, we denote the rooted list of generators by R(J(G)s) = U1, . . . , Ur.
The following lemma is a version of Proposition 4.1.

Lemma 5.6. Let G be a chordal graph with F (J(G)s) = G(J(G)s). Let R(G) = u1, . . . , uq and let R(J(G)s) = Y1, . . . , Yp. Suppose that Yr = uj1 . . . ujs is the maximal expression for some 2  r  p with j1  · · ·  js. For each 1  t  s with 2  jt we have
(u1, u2, . . . , ujt-1) : (ujt)  (Y1, . . . , Yr-1) : (Yr).
Proof. The ideal (u1, u2, . . . , ujt-1) : (ujt) is generated by variables since the rooted order gives linear quotients by Lemma 5.4. Let  < jt with u : ujt = xz for some variable xz. Consider the s-fold product M = Yru/ujt. Then M : Yr = xz and M>RYr. By assumption M is a minimal generator of J(G)s and the proof follows.

Figure 3. Diamond graph

In the next chordal example, we construct a rooted list R(G) such that rooted order >R on the generators of J(G)s yield linear quotients for all s  1.

Example 5.7. Let G be the chordal graph in Figure 3. As in notation of Definition 5.2 the vertex x1 is a simplicial vertex and N (x1) = {x2, x3}. Observe that H1 is the graph consisting of the isolated vertex x4. Also, H2 and H3 are empty graphs. Therefore we take R(H1) = R(H2) = R(H3) = 1. Then the rooted list of G is R(G) = u1, u2, u3 where

u1 = x2x3, u2 = x1x3x4, u3 = x1x2x4.

It is not hard to see that

F (J(G)s) = G(J(G)s)

and every s-fold product has a unique expression. Let R(J(G)s) = Y1, . . . , Yp. Now we will show that J(G)s has linear quotients with respect to the order Y1, . . . , Yp. Suppose that Yr = u1 u2 u3 with r  2. Consider the ideal I defined by

(x2, x3) I = (x3)
(x2)

if  = 0 and  = 0 if  = 0 and  = 0 if  = 0 and  = 0

Since r  2, we claim that I = (Y1, . . . , Yr-1) : (Yr). It is clear from Lemma 5.6 that I  (Y1, . . . , Yr-1) : (Yr) because (u1) : (u2) = (x2) and (u1, u2) : (u3) = (x3). To see the reverse, assume for a contradiction there exists  < r such that no variable in I divides Y : Yr. Let Y = u1 u2 u3.
Case 1: Suppose  = 0 and  = 0. Comparing exponents of x2 and x3 in Y and Yr we see that  +    +  and  +    + . Since both Y and Yr are s-fold products we have  +  +  =  +  +  and thus   . Since Y >R Yr by definition of rooted order we get  = . This implies  =  and  =  and  = r, contradiction.
Case 2: Suppose  = 0 and  = 0. Comparing exponents of x3 in Y and Yr we see that  +   . In particular   . By definition of rooted order  =  must hold. This implies  = 0 and  = . Therefore  = r, contradiction.
Case 3: Suppose  = 0 and  = 0. Comparing exponents of x2 in Y and Yr we see that  +   . In particular   . By definition of rooted order  =  must hold. This implies  = 0 and  = . Therefore  = r, contradiction.

We do not know any example of a power of a chordal graph which does not give linear quotients with respect to a rooted order. Therefore this led us to the following question.
Question 5.8. Given a chordal graph G, does there exist a rooted list R(G) such that the rooted order >R on the minimal generating set of J(G)s yields linear quotients for every s  1?
