Abstract. In this work we study the Humbert-Edge's curves of type 5, defined as a complete

intersection of four diagonal quadrics in P5. We characterize them using Kummer surfaces and

using the geometry of these surfaces we construct some vanishing thetanulls on such curves. In

addition, we describe an argument to give an isomorphism between the moduli space of Humbert-

Edge's curves of type 5 and the moduli space of hyperelliptic curves of genus 2, and we let see

how this argument can be generalized to state an isomorphism between the moduli space of

1. Introduction
W.L. Edge began the study of Humbert's curves in [5], such curves are defined as canonical curves in P4 that are complete intersection of three diagonal quadrics. A natural generalization of Humbert's curve was later introduced by Edge in [7]: irreducible, non-degenerated and non-singular curves on Pn that are the complete intersection of n - 1 diagonal quadrics. One important feature of Humbert-Edge's curves of type n noted by Edge in [7] is that each one can be write down in a normal form. Indeed, we can assume that the n - 1 quadrics in Pn are given by
n
Qi = aijx2j , i = 0, . . . , n - 1
j=0
where aj  C for all j  {0, . . . , n} and aj = ak if j = k. We say that a curve satisfying this conditions is a Humbert-Edge's curve of type n. Note that in the case of a Humbert's curve X, i.e. when n = 4, this form of the equations implies directly that X is contained in a degree four Del Pezzo surface.
The Humbert-Edge's curve of type n for n > 4 have been studied in just a few works. Carocca, Gonz´alez-Aguilera, Hidalgo and Rodr´iguez studied in [3] the Humbert-Edge's curves from the point of view of uniformization and Klenian groups. Using a suitable form of the quadrics, Hidalgo presented in [11] and [12] a family of Humbert-Edge's curves of type 5 whose fields of moduli are contained in R but none of their fields of definition are contained in R. Fr´ias-Medina and Zamora presented in [9] a characterization of Humbert-Edge's curves using certain abelian groups of order 2n and presented specializations admitting larger automorphism subgroups. Carvacho, Hidalgo and Quispe determined in [4] the decomposition of the Jacobian of generalized Fermat curves, and as a consequence for Humbert-Edge's curves.

decomposition of the Jacobian of a Humbert-Edge's curve more precisely given the exact number of factors in the decomposition and their corresponding dimensions.
In the case n = 5, the normal form for these curves implies that they are contained in a special K3 surface, a Kummer surface. In this work, we study the Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5 and determine some properties using the geometry of Kummer surfaces.
Recall that an algebraic (complex) K3 surface is a complete non-singular projective (compact connected complex) surface S such that S = OS and H1(S, OS ) = 0. Classically, a (singular) Kummer surface is a surface in P3 of degree 4 with 16 nodes and no other singularities. An important fact about Kummer surfaces is that are determined by the set of their nodes. One can take the resolution of singularities of a Kummer surface, the obtained non-singular surface is a K3 surface. For our purposes, these non-singular models will be called Kummer surfaces.
The Kummer surfaces that we will take for our study are those coming from a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. In such case, an important feature shared by Humbert-Edge's curves of type 5 and Kummer surfaces is that they admit the automorphism subgroup generated by the natural involutions of P5 that change the i-th coordinate by its negative:

i : P5



P5

(x0 : · · · : xi · · · : x5)  (x0 : · · · : -xi : · · · : x5)

These automorphisms along with Knutsen's result [14] on the existence of a K3 surface of degree

2n in Pn+1 containing a smooth curve of genus g and degree d will enable us to characterize the

Humbert-Edge's curves of type 5 using the geometry of a Kummer surface.

This work is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the construction of a Kummer surface

from a two-dimensional torus and conditions that ensure when a Kummer surface is projective.

Later, we focus on the case of Kummer surface obtained from hyperelliptic curves of genus 2.

Section 3 is splited into three parts. First, in Section 3.1, we review the basic properties of Humbert-

Edge's curves of type 5 and characterize them using the geometry of the Kummer surface. Later,

in Section 3.2, we present the construction of some odd theta characteristic on a Humbert-Edge's

curve of type 5 using the automorphisms i's and some vanishing thetanulls using the Rosenhain

tetrahedra associated to the Kummer surface. Finally, in Section 3.3 we use the embedding given in

[3] to construct an isomorphism between the moduli space HE5 of Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5

and the moduli space H2 of hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 and as a consequence, we obtain that H2

is a three-dimensional closed subavariety of M17. Moreover, we generalized this argument to show

that there is an isomorphism between the moduli space HEn of Humbert-Edge's curves of type n,

2. Kummer surfaces

2.1. Construction from a two-dimensional torus. In this paper the ground field is the complex numbers. In this section, we recall the construction of the Kummer surface associated with a twodimensional torus.
Let T be a two-dimensional torus. Consider the involution  : T  T which sends a  -a and take the quotient surface T /  . The surface T /  is known as the singular Kummer surface of T . It is well-known that this surface has 16 ordinary singularities and resolving them we obtain a K3 surface called the Kummer surface of T and denoted by Km(T ) (see for example [10, Theorem 3.4]). This procedure is called the Kummer process. Note that by construction, Km(T ) has 16 disjoint smooth rational curves, indeed, they correspond to the singular points of the quotient surface. Conversely, Nikulin proved in [15] the converse:

Theorem 2.1. If a K3 surface S contains 16 disjoint smooth rational curves, then there exists a unique complex torus, up to isomorphism, such that S and the rational curves are obtained by the Kummer process. In particular, S is a Kummer surface.

Note that the above construction holds true for any two-dimensional torus, not a necessary projective one. In particular, with this process it is possible construct K3 surfaces that are not projective. However, there is an equivalence between the projectivity of the torus and the associated K3 surface (see [2, Theorem 4.5.4]):

Theorem 2.2. Let T be a two-dimensional torus. T is an abelian surface if an only if Km(T ) is projective.

Now, if A is a principally polarized abelian surface, then A is one of the following (see [2, Corollary 11.8.2]):
a) The Jacobian of a smooth hyperelliptic curve of genus 2, or b) The canonical polarized product of two elliptic curves.
As we will see next, the Case a) is the one of our interest.

2.2. Hyperelliptic curves of genus 2 and Kummer surfaces. We are interested in K3 surfaces that are a smooth complete intersection of type (2, 2, 2) in P5, i.e. that are a complete intersection of three quadrics. Moreover, we restrict to the case in which the quadrics are diagonal. The interest of having diagonal quadrics defining the K3 surface is that they enable us to work with hyperelliptic curves of genus 2.
Indeed, let C be the hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 given by the affine equation

(1)

y2 = f (x) = (x - a0)(x - a1) · · · (x - a5),

where a0, . . . , a5  C and ai = aj if i = j. We can consider the jacobian surface J(C) associated with C and applying the Kummer process we obtain that the K3 surface Km(J(C)) is isomorphic to the surface in P5 defined by the complete intersection of the 3 diagonal quadrics by [16, Theorem
2.5].

In order to obtain a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 beginning with a smooth K3 surface S in P5 given by the complete intersection of three diagonal quadrics, we may assume an additional
hypothesis. Edge studied in [6] the Kummer surfaces defined by (2). One of his result establishes
that whenever a surface X given by the intersection of three linearly independent quadrics has a common self-polar simplex  in P5 and contains a line in general position, then the equations
defining X can be written with the form (2). Observe that this fact is equivalent to require that X contains 16 disjoint lines, indeed, using the natural involutions of P5 one can obtain the others
lines. Then, let S be a smooth K3 surface in P5 given by the complete intersection of the quadrics

5
Qi = aijx2j , i = 0, 1, 2,
j=0

where aij  C for i = 0, 1, 2 and j = 0, . . . , 5 and assume that S contains 16 disjoint lines. As a consequence, we may assume that S is given by the quadrics in (2) for some ai  C where ai = aj if i = j. By [15, Theorem 1] there exists an unique (up to isomorphism) two-dimensional torus

4

ABEL CASTORENA AND JUAN BOSCO FR´IAS-MEDINA

that gives rise the surface S. Taking the hyperelliptic curve C given by the equation y2 = f (x) = (x - a0)(x - a1) · · · (x - a5), we obtain that S is isomorphic to Km(J(C)).
From now on, we say that a Kummer surface is a smooth surface in P5 given by the complete intersection of three diagonal quadrics as in (2).
For a Kummer surface S given by (2), it is possible give the parametric form of the 32 lines contained in S. Indeed, in [6] Edge noted that the equation of a line  contained in S is given in the following parametric form:

(3)

t + a0 , t + a1 , t + a2 , t + a3 , t + a4 , t + a5 .

f (a0) f (a1) f (a2) f (a3) f (a4) f (a5)

Recall that the natural automorphisms i : xi  -xi of P5 act on S. Denote by E the group 0, . . . , 5 . Applying each element of E to the line , we obtain the other 32 lines on S. The identity gives the line  and the remaining elements give the other 31 lines:

· i := i() for all i  {0, . . . , 5}, · ij := ij() for different i, j  {0, . . . , 5} · ijk := ij k() for different i, j, k  {0, . . . , 5}.
It is well-know that a singular Kummer surface K is birational to a Weddle surface W (see for example [17, Proposition 1]). A Weddle surface is a quartic surface in P3 with 6 nodes. The 32 lines on S have a geometric interpretation in both K and W as Edge pointed in [6]. Indeed, the projection  of S from  is a Weddle surface W and it occurs:

· (i) = ki is a node on W , for all i = 0, . . . , 5, · (ij) is the line through ki and kj , for different indices i, j  {0, . . . , 5}, · (ijh) is the line in the intersection of the plane generated by ki, kj, kh with the comple-
mentary plane, for different indices i, j, h  {0, . . . , 5}, and · () is the cubic on W through the six nodes ki's.
On the other hand, since S is the resolution of singularities of K it occurs:

· The 16 nodes of K correspond to the 16 lines i and ijk, and · The conics of contact of K with its 16 tropes correspond to the 16 lines  and ij.
A trope is a plane which intersects the quartic along a conic. The nodes and the tropes of a singular Kummer surface provide an interesting configuration on it.

Definition 2.3. Let  be a set of 16 planes and 16 points in P3.
·  is a (16, 6)-configuration if every plane contains exactly 6 of the 16 points and every point lies in exactly 6 of the 16 planes. The 16 planes are called special planes.
· A (16, 6)-configuration is non-degenerated if every two special planes shared exactly two points of the configuration and every pair of points is contained in exactly two special planes.
· An abstract (16, 6)-configuration is a 16 × 16 matrix (aij) whose entries are ones or zeros, with exactly 6 ones in each row and in each column. The rows of the matrix are called points of the configuration and the columns are called planes of the configuration. The i-th point belongs to the j-th plane if and only if aij = 1.

Gonzalez-Dorrego classified in [10] the non-degenerated (16, 6)-configurations and used them to classify the singular Kummer surfaces. Given a singular Kummer surface, the nodes and the tropes establish a non-degenerated (16, 6)-configuration (see [10, Corollary 2.18]) and conversely, given a (16, 6)-configuration, there exists a singular Kummer surface whose associated (16, 6)-configuration is the given one (see [10, Theorem 2.20]).

Definition 2.4. A Rosenhain tetrahedron in an abstract (16, 6)-configuration is a set of 4 points and 4 planes such that each plane contains exactly 3 points and each point belongs to exactly 3 planes. The 4 points are the vertices of the tetrahedron. An edge is a pair of vertices and a face a triple of vertices.
Rosenhain tetrahedra always exist in a singular Kummer surface, in fact, there exist 80 of them ([10, Corollary 3.21]). Moreover, these tetrahedra are relevant because using them we can construct divisors that are linearly equivalent and whose class induces the closed embedding to P5 (see [10, Proposition 3.22 and Remark 3.24]):
Proposition 2.5. Given a Rosenhain tetrahedron on a singular Kummer surface K, let D be the divisor on the associated Kummer surface S given by the sum of proper transforms of the 4 conics in which the planes meet on K and the 4 exceptional divisors corresponding to the 4 nodes. Then, the linear equivalence class of D is independent of the choice of the Rosenhain tetrahedron. In addition, D2 = 8, dim|D| = 5 and the linear system |D| induces a closed embedding of S in P5 as the complete intersection of three quadrics.
These divisors will be used in next section to construct vanishing thetanulls on Humbert-Edge's curves of type 5.

3. Humbert-Edge curves of type 5
3.1. Properties and characterization. Here, we review the main properties of the HumbertEdge's curve of type 5 and present a characterization using the lines lying on a Kummer surface.
Definition 3.1. An irreducible, non-degenerated and non-singular curve X5  P5 is a HumbertEdge's curve of type 5 if it is the complete intersection of 4 diagonal quadrics Q0, . . . , Q3:
5
Qi = aij x2j , i = 0, . . . , 3.
j=0
The basic properties of a Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5 are stated below.
Lemma 3.2. Let X5  P5 be a Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5. The following hold:
(1) X5 is a curve of degree 16. (2) The genus of X5 is equal to g(X5) = 17. (3) Every 4-minor of the matrix (aij ) is non-degenerated. (4) X5 is non-trigonal.
The diagonal form of the equations defining a Humbert-Edge's curve X5 of type 5 implies that it admits the action of the group E generated by the six involutions i : xi  -xi acting with fixed points and whose product is the identity. Moreover, these involutions establish a relation between the Humbert-Edge's curves of type 5 and the Humbert's curves in P4. For every i = 0, . . . , 5, we can consider the covering i : X5  X5/ i induced by the involution i. This is a two-to-one covering ramified at 16 points obtained as the intersection points of X5 with the hyperplane V (xi). In addition, the quotient of X5/ i is a Humbert's curve in P4. This double covering can be interpreted geometrically as the projection of X5 with center ei onto the hyperplane V (xi).
Next result shows that a Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5 is always contained in a Kummer surface. It is a consequence of the fact noted by Edge in [7] that a Humbert-Edge's curve of type n can be written in a normal form.

Proposition 3.3. Let X5  P5 be a Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5. There exists a Kummer surface in P5 which contains X5.

Proof. Assume that X5 is given by the equations
5
Qi = aijx2j , i = 0, . . . , 3
j=0

where aij  C. For each j = 0, . . . , 5, consider the coefficients aij as the entries of the point pj = (a0j : a1j : a2j : a3j) in the projective space P3. We have six points p0, . . . , p5 in P3 that are in general position, so there exists a unique rational normal curve C  P3 through these points.
Finally, take a change of coordinates of P3 such that C is in the standard parametric form, then we
may assume that pj = (1 : aj : a2j : a3j ) for all j = 0, . . . , 5. Therefore, we obtain that X5 is given by the equations

(4)

Qi = aijx2j , i = 0, . . . , 3

with aj  C, j = 0, . . . , 5 and ai = ai i = j. The quadrics Q0, Q1, Q2 define the Kummer surface

associated with the hyperelliptic curve y2 =

).

Therefore,

X5

is

contained

in

a

surface.

Remark 3.4. Note that given a Humbert-Edge's curve X5 of type 5 in normal form (4), by the above proposition it is always possible to find an hyperelliptic curve C such that the Kummer surface Km(J(C)) contains X5. Reciprocally, given an hyperelliptic curve C of genus 2, by the discussion in Section 2.2, in a natural way the associated Kummer surface Km(J(C)) contains a Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5 whose equations are in the normal form (4). Denote by Mg the moduli space of smooth and irreducible curves of genus g. Note that Proposition 3.3 let us see that a Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5 depends of three parameters in M17, in fact in Section 3.3 we prove that the moduli space of Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5 is isomorphic to the moduli space of hyperelliptic curves of genus 2.
Next we present a characterization for Humbert-Edge's curves of type 5 using the lines on Kummer surfaces.
Theorem 3.5. Let X  P5 be an irreducible, non-degerated and non-singular curve of degree 16 and genus 17. The following statements are equivalent:
(i) X is a Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5. (ii) X admits six involutions 0, . . . , 5 such that 0, . . . , 5 = (Z/2Z)5, 0 · · · 5 = 1 and the
quotient X/ i is a Humbert's curve for every i = 0, . . . , 5. (iii) There exists a Kummer surface S which contains X and such that the intersection of X
with the 16 lines  and ij is at most one point. (iv) There exists a Kummer surface S which contains X and such that the intersection of X
with the 16 lines i and ijk is at most one point.
Proof. (i)(ii) We have this equivalence by [9, Theorem 3.4]. (i)(iii) Assume that X is Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5. Proposition 3.3 implies that X is
contained in a Kummer surface S. So, we may assume the existence of different scalars a0, . . . , a5 

GEOMETRIC ASPECTS ON HUMBERT-EDGE'S CURVES OF TYPE 5

7

C such that X is given by the equations
5
Qi = aijx2j , i = 0, . . . , 3
j=0
and S is given by the equations Q0, Q1, Q2. Consider the line  in parametric form as in (3). A direct computation shows that for every t  C,

Q3

t + a0 , t + a1 , t + a2 , t + a3 , t + a4 , t + a5 = 1. f (a0) f (a1) f (a2) f (a3) f (a4) f (a5)

Therefore, X does not intersect the line  and the diagonal form of the third equation implies that X also does not intersect the lines ij for every i, j  {0, . . . , 5} with i = j.
(iii)(i) Assume that X is contained in a Kummer surface S defined by the equations

5
Qi = aijx2j , i = 0, 1, 2,
j=0

where ai = aj if i = j, and such that X does not intersect the lines , ij in two different points for

all i, j  {0, . . . , 5} with i = j. We denote f (x) =

5 i=0

(x

-

ai).

Since S

is a K3 surface of type

(2, 2, 2) in P5 containing X, our situation should be one of the cases determined by Knutsen in [14,

Theorem 6.1 (3)]. In fact, we are in the case a) of the latter, in Knutsen's notation we have n = 4,

d = 16, g = 17 and g = d2/16 + 1. Moreover, such result implies that X is the complete intersection

of S and a hypersurface of degree d/8, i.e. X is the complete intersection of four quadrics. Denote

the fourth quadric by

5

Q = dj x2j +

dij xixj .

j=0

0i<j5

Now, when we evaluate the quadric Q in the parametric form of  we obtain a quadratic equation with parameter t with leading coefficient

The hypothesis that Q does not intersect the line  in two different points implies that such coefficient vanishes (the coefficient of t could vanishes but in such case the constant term must be different from zero). This also occurs for all of the 15 lines ij by hypothesis, and then we have 16 imposed conditions. The leading coefficient for the line ij can be deduced from the above one, in fact, since the line ij is obtained from  by the application of ij , it is enough to add a negative sign to the coefficient of the terms drs whenever r or s are equal to i or j. Solving the linear system in the variables dj's and dij 's, we obtain that all the dij 's are equal to zero, that d0, d1, d2, d3 and d4 are free parameters and

Therefore, X is the complete intersection of four diagonal quadrics in P5 and we conclude that it is a Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5.

(iii)(iv) As above, assuming that X is contained in a Kummer surface S defined by the equations
5
Qi = aijx2j , i = 0, 1, 2,
j=0
where ai = aj if i = j, by [14, Theorem 6.1 (3)] we ensure that X is the complete intersection of S and a hypersurface of degree 2. Under the hypothesis of (iii) or (iv), when we solve the system of equations in the parameter t as we previously did, we obtained that the coefficient of every mixed term vanishes and d5 have the form of (5). The remaining conditions, (iv) or (iii) respectively, do not impose new conditions on the coefficients.
3.2. Theta characteristics. In this section we use the coverings given by the subgroups generated by involutions i's and the Rosenhain tetrahedra of singular Kummer surfaces to construct theta characteristics on a Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5. We recall the definition of a theta characteristic and a vanishing thetanull.
Definition 3.6. Let X be an algebraic curve. A line bundle L on X is a theta characteristic if L2  KX . A theta characteristic L is even (respectively, odd) if h0(L) is even (respectively, odd). A vanishing thetanull is an even theta characteristic L such that h0(L) > 0.
Recall that given a Humbert-Edge's curve X5 of type 5, for every i = 0, . . . , 5 the double covering i : X5  X5/ i is ramified at 16 points obtained as the intersection points of X5 with the hyperplane V (xi). Denote by Ri = pi1 + · · · + pi16 the ramification divisor for every i = 0, . . . , 5.
Proposition 3.7. Let X5  P5 be a Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5. X5 admits 26 odd theta characteristics with 3 sections, 6 of them corresponds to the line bundle associated with the ramification divisors and the remaining 20 are induced by the coverings associated to the subgroups generated by three different involutions i, j and k for i, j, k  {0, . . . , 5}.
Proof. For i, j  {0, . . . , 5}, consider the subgroup generated by the involutions i and j and take the induced covering of degree four ij : X5  X5/ i, j . This is a simply ramified covering with the 32 ramified points pi1, . . . , pi16, pj1, . . . , pj16. Since X5/ i, j = Eij is an elliptic curve, it follows that
KX5  ij (KEij ) + Ri + Rj = Ri + Rj .
So, KX5  Ri+Rj for all i, j  {0, . . . , 5}. Fix and index i  {0, . . . , 5} and take j, k  {0, . . . , 5}\{i} with j = k. Using the fact that
Ri + Rk  KX5  Rk + Rj ,
we have that Ri  Rj. Thus, KX5  Ri + Rj  2Ri and Ri is a theta characteristic. Now, let i, j, k  {0, . . . , 5} be different indices. The covering of degree eight ijk : X5 
X5/ i, j, k is a simply ramified covering in the 48 points pi1, . . . , pi16, pj1, . . . , pj16, pk1, . . . , pk16. Note that X5/ i, j , k = P1. Then,
KX5  ijk(KP1 ) + Ri + Rj + Rk  ijk(KP1 ) + Ri + KX5 .
Therefore, we have that ijk(-KP1)  Ri and we conclude that ijk(OP1 (2)) is a theta characteristic of X5.
Next step is to compute h0(ijk(OP1 (2)). To do so, we will use the fact that h0(ijk(OP1 (2))) = h0(ijkijk(OP1(2))). The covering ijk is determined by a line bundle L on P1 such that L8 =

GEOMETRIC ASPECTS ON HUMBERT-EDGE'S CURVES OF TYPE 5

9

OP1 (ijk (Ri + Rj + Rk)) and in addition, we have that ijk OX5 = OP1  L-1  · · ·  L-7. By the projection formula:
ijkijk (OP1 (2)) = OP1 (2)  ijkOX5 = OP1 (2)  (OP1  L-1  · · ·  L-7) = (OP1 (2)  OP1 )  (OP1 (2)  L-1)  · · ·  (OP1 (2)  L-7).
From the equality L8 = OP1(ijk(Ri+Rj+Rk)) we get that the degree of L is equal to 6, this implies that OP1 (2)  L-n has no sections for every n = 1, . . . , 7. Therefore, ijkijk(OP1 (2)) = OP1 (2) and it follows that h0(ijk(OP1 (2))) = 3. Finally, the line bundle OX5 (Ri) has 3 sections since Ri  ijk (-KP1).
Using the geometry of the Kummer surface, we can determine some vanishing thetanulls on a Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5.
Proposition 3.8. Let X5  P5 be a Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5. X5 admits 80 vanishing thetanulls with 6 sections corresponding to Rosenhain tetrahedra of the associated singular Kummer surface K.
Proof. By Proposition 3.3 X5 is contained in a Kummer surface S. Denote by K the singular Kummer surface associated with S. For a Rosenhain tetrahedron on K, let D be the associated divisor in S (see Proposition 2.5). By [14, Proposition 3.1] we have that X5 and D are dependent in Pic(S), in fact, X5 appears as an element in the linear system |2D|. Using the fact that the canonical bundle of S is trivial and that X5  |2D|, the adjunction formula implies that
KX5 = (KS + X5)|X5 = (2D)|X5 = 2D|X5 .
Thus, the divisor D|X5 is a theta characteristic. It only remains the calculation of h0(D|X5 ). Twisting the exact sequence of sheaves
0  OS(-X5)  OS  OX5  0
we obtain the exact sequence
0  OS(-D)  OS (D)  OX5 (D)  0,
and therefore we obtain the exact sequence in cohomology
0  H0(S, -D)  H0(S, D)  H0(X5, D|X5)  H1(S, -D).
We have H0(S, -D) = 0 and since D is very ample, by Mumford vanishing theorem we obtain that H1(S, -D) = 0. Then, H0(S, D) = H0(X5, D|X5) and from dim|D| = 5 it follows that h0(X5, D|X5) = 6. We conclude the proof recalling that there are 80 Rosenhain tetrahedra associated to a singular Kummer surface (see Proposition 2.5).

We conclude this subsection with the following remarks:
· The way to construct the vanishing thetanulls for a Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5 using the geometry of a Kummer surface differs completely to the classical case: a Humbert's curve X admits exactly 10 vanishing thetanulls and can be constructed by taking the quotients of X by the subgroup generated by two involutions (see the proof of [9, Theorem 2.2]), the geometry of the Del Pezzo surface containing X is not involved in such process.

· The procedure used in Proposition 3.8 to construct the vanishing thetanulls holds true for every smooth curve on degree 16 and genus 17 on a Kummer surface S. Indeed, if Y is any smooth curve of degree 16 and genus 17 contained S, then using again [14, Proposition 3.1] we have that Y and D are dependent on Pic(S) and the previous argument holds.

3.3. Moduli space of Humbert-Edge's curves of type 5. As we mention in Remark 3.4, given a Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5 always it is possible to associate a hyperlliptic curve of genus 2 and vice-versa. Here, we discuss about this fact and using the results of Carocca, G´onzalez-Aguilera, Hidalgo and Rodr´iguez [3] we prove that the moduli space of Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5 is isomorphic to the moduli space of hyperelliptic curves of genus 2.
Given a Humbert-Edge's curve X5 of type 5, using Edge's idea of consider the coefficients as points in P3 and the unique rational normal curve in P3 through them, one is able to write down the equations of X5 in normal form (see the proof of Proposition 4):

5

(6)

Qi = aijx2j , i = 0, . . . , 3,

j=0

where aj  C for j = 0, . . . , 5 and aj = ak if j = k. Note that since the rational normal curve that we are considering is constructed via the Veronese map  : P1  P3, one can fix three points in P1 and therefore X5 depends only on three different complex numbers. Thus, we can assume that we are fixing the points 0, 1 and  and then we have three free different parameters 1, 2 and 3 defining the curve X5. Since this idea can be carry out in the general case of Humbert-Edge's curves of type n, with this fact in mind in [3, Section 4.1] the authors found an embedding for Humbert-Edge's curves of type n in Pn in such way that the equations depends on n - 2 different
parameters. In the particular case of the Humbert-Edge's curve X5 of type 5, the equations take the form

x20 + x21 + x22 = 0 1x20 + x21 + x23 = 0 2x20 + x21 + x24 = 0 3x20 + x11 + x25 = 0,
where 1, 2, 3  C\{0, 1} are different complex numbers. To emphasis the dependence on the parameters 1, 2, 3 and considering that we are fixing 0, 1, , we denote this curve as X5(1, 2, 3). Also, note that if we consider the degree 32 map given by

then

is the branch locus of (1,2,3). On the other hand, if C is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2, then we can write the equation which
defines C as

y2 = (x - a0)(x - a1) · · · (x - a5),

where aj  C for j = 0, . . . , 5 and aj = ak if j = k. Since always there exists an automorphism of P1 which carries a tuple of different complex numbers (a0, a1, a2) to (0, 1, ), we may assume that
C is given by the equation

(9)

y2 = x(x - 1)(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3),

where 1, 2, 3  C\{0, 1} are different. Similarly as before, we denoted by C(1, 2, 3) to the hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 with parameters 0, 1, , 1, 2 and 3. In addition, since C(1, 2, 3) is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2, there exists a degree 2 map (1,2,3) : C(1, 2, 3)  P1 whose branch locus is precisely given by (7).
In both cases of Humbert-Edge's curves of type 5 and hyperelliptic curves of genus 2, given such a curve we have a map to P1 with a specific branch locus. In fact, the branch locus determines the
curve modulo isomorphism. Indeed, Hidalgo, Reyes-Carocca and Vald´es determined in [13, Section
2.3] when two generalized Fermat curves are isomorphic, in particular, the following result can be
deduced:

Proposition 3.9. Let X5(1, 2, 3) and X5(µ1, µ2, µ3) be a Humbert-Edge's curves of type 5. The following statements are equivalent:
(1) X5(1, 2, 3) is isomorphic to X5(µ1, µ2, µ3). (2) There exists a M¨obius transformation M such that

{M (0), M (1), M (), M (1), M (2), M (3)} = {0, 1, , µ1, µ2, µ3}. In the case of hyperelliptic curves of genus 2 we have an analogous result (see [8, Section III.7.3]):

Proposition 3.10. Let C(1, 2, 3) and C(µ1, µ2, µ3) be hyperelliptic curves of genus 2. The following statements are equivalent:
(1) C(1, 2, 3) is isomorphic to C(µ1, µ2, µ3). (2) There exists a M¨obius transformation M such that

{M (0), M (1), M (), M (1), M (2), M (3)} = {0, 1, , µ1, µ2, µ3}. The above results can be summarized in the following commuting diagram:

We denote by HE5 the moduli space of Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5, that is, the set of Humbert-Edge's curves of type 5 modulo isomorphism. Similarly, we denote by H2 the moduli space of hyperelliptic curves of genus 2. By the above discussion we have a well-defined map
f : H2  HE5
[C(1, 2, 3)]  [X5(1, 2, 3)]
By construction, it is immediate that f is a surjective map. The following proposition deals with the injectivity.

12

ABEL CASTORENA AND JUAN BOSCO FR´IAS-MEDINA

Proposition 3.11. The above map f : H2  HE5 is injective. Therefore, f is an isomorphism of moduli spaces.

Proof. Let C(1, 2, 3) and C(µ1, µ2, µ3) be hyperelliptic curves of genus 2. Assuming that f is an injective map we have that f ([C(1, 2, 3)]) = f ([C(µ1, µ2, µ3)]), that is, [X5(1, 2, 3)] = [X5(µ1, µ2, µ3)]. Then, there exists an isomorphism between X5(1, 2, 3) and X5(µ1, µ2, µ3). By Proposition 3.9 there exists a Mo¨bius transformation M such that
{M (0), M (1), M (), M (1), M (2), M (3)} = {0, 1, , µ1, µ2, µ3}.
Thus, by Proposition 3.10 we conclude that the hyperelliptic curves C(1, 2, 3) and C(µ1, µ2, µ3) are isomorphic.

Since every Humbert-Edge's curve of type 5 has genus 17, there is a natural map q : HE 5  M17 between HE5 and the moduli space M17 of curves of genus 17. In [3, Proposition 4.3] the authors proved that such map is injective. Thus, using the isomorphism f we obtain the following:

Corollary 3.12. The moduli space H2 of hyperelliptic curves of genus 2 is a three-dimensional closed algebraic variety in M17 via the composition q  f : H2  M17.

We conclude this paper noting that in the general case, the moduli space of Humbert-Edge's

curves of type n, where n  5 is an odd number, is isomorphic to the moduli space of hyperelliptic

...

n-2x20 + x11 + x2n = 0,
where 1, . . . , n-2  C\{0, 1} are different (see [3, Section 4.1]). On the other hand, a hyperelliptic curve C(1, . . . , 2g-1) of genus g is given by the equation
y2 = x(x - 1)(x - 1) · · · (x - 2g-1),
where 1, . . . , 2g-1  C\{0, 1} are different. Since Propositions 3.9 and 3.10 in fact hold true in the general case (see [13, Section 2.3] and [8, Section III.7.3] respectively), under the assumptions that n  5 is odd and n - 2 = 2g - 1 = r, we can define a surjective map

fr : Hg  HEn [C(1, . . . , r)]  [Xn(1, . . . , r)],

3.11 and using the fact that the natural map qn : HEn  Mgn is injective (since any HumbertEdge's curve of type n has genus gn = 2n-2(n - 3) + 1 and [3, Proposition 4.3]) we conclude the

following:

Proposition 3.13. If n  5 is an odd number and n-2 = 2g -1 = r, then the map fr : Hg  HEn
is an isomorphism of moduli spaces. In particular, we have that Hg is an (n - 2)-dimensional closed variety in Mgn via the composition qn  fr : Hg  Mgn , where gn = 2n-2(n - 3) + 1.
