## Abstract

Moreover, we introduce a higher-dimensional analogue of Fell's condition and show that it completely characterizes subhomogeneity of central sequence algebras. In contrast, we show that any non-trivial extension by compact operators has not only non-abelian but not even residually type I central sequence algebra. In particular its central sequence algebra is not type I and not residually finite-dimensional (RFD). Our techniques extensively use properties of nilpotent elements in C*-algebras.
