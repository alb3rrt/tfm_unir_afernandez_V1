Many-body energy invariant for T -linear resistivity

The description of dynamics of strongly correlated quantum matter is a challenge, particularly in physical situations where a quasiparticle description is absent. In such situations, however, the many-body Kubo formula from linear response theory, involving matrix elements of the current operator computed with many-body wavefunctions, remains valid. Working directly in the many-body Hilbert space and not making any reference to quasiparticles (or lack thereof), we address the puzzle of linear in temperature (T -linear) resistivity seen in non-Fermi liquid phases that occur in several strongly correlated condensed matter systems. We derive a simple criterion for the occurrence of T -linear resistivity based on an analysis of the contributions to the many-body Kubo formula, determined by an energy invariant "f -function" involving current matrix elements and energy eigenvalues that describes the DC conductivity of the system in the microcanonical ensemble. Using full diagonalization, we test this criterion for the f -function in the spinless nearest neighbor Hubbard model, and in a system of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev dots coupled by weak single particle hopping. We also study the f -function for the spin conductivity in the 2D Heisenberg model with similar conclusions. Our work suggests that a general principle, formulated in terms of many-body Hilbert space concepts, is at the core of the occurrence of T -linear resistivity in a wide range of systems, and precisely translates T -linear resistivity into a notion of energy scale invariance far beyond what is typically associated with quantum critical points.

Introduction: How do strongly correlated materials (eg. the high Tc superconducting cuprates, heavy fermions and more recently, twisted bilayer graphene [1­8]) conduct electricity at finite temperature? This is a fundamental question that has existed since the realization of these materials, and the inception of this field decades ago. Experiments have helped build an intricate picture of the phases that occur, both from the point of their static and dynamical properties at finite temperature, but much remains to be accomplished to have a definitive theoretical understanding of these materials. For example, at and close to optimal doping, the superconducting phase transitions to the "non Fermi liquid" (nFL) or "strange metal" phase which is characterized by an electrical resistivity that scales linearly with temperature (T -linear) over a wide range of T [2­7, 9]. This is in sharp contrast to Fermi liquid (FL) theory which predicts that the electrical resistivity of a metal scales as T 2 [10].
nFLs, in contrast to FLs, are characterized by a lack of quasiparticles, leading to a concerted effort to find models and mechanisms by which T -linear resistivity can occur. Prominent among these is the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and its variants [11­13] which are analytically solvable in a large N , limit and exhibit T -linear resistivity (when multiple SYK dots are coupled) [14, 15]. However, the connection of this model to a realistic microscopic model remains to be established. Recent experiments with cold atoms [16] have shown the existence of T -linear resistivity in the Hubbard model which has been supported by dynamical mean field theory [17­20] and exact diagonalization [17, 21] calculations.
We address the question of T -linear resistivity, circumventing the issue of quasiparticles (or lack thereof) completely. We work directly with the full set of quantum many-body

wavefunctions (which contain information about the resistivity at all temperature scales), and appeal to a direct analysis of the many-body Kubo formula [22]. This is valid within linear response, which is sufficient given that the experimentally applied electric fields are small perturbations to the full electronic Hamiltonian. The expression for the longitudinal conductivity (i.e. the inverse of the electrical resistivity ) is given by,

1 - e- (, T ) =  Z

where  is the energy of interest (the DC limit corresponds to   0), En, Em are eigenenergies, of the nth and mth eigenstates respectively, Z is the partition function,  is a label for the spatial direction (x or y in two dimensions) and Inm  n|I|m are matrix elements of the current operator, and  is the inverse temperature.
At extremely high temperatures (higher than any energy scale in the system), Ref. [23] stated a straightforward reason for T -linear resistivity. In this limit, the thermal factors exp(-En), occurring in the numerator and the partition function in the denominator, all become one. At high temperature and vanishing frequency,   0 and   0, the factor of (1-exp(-))/  , which yields the linear in  conductivity and hence T -linear resistivity. Though mathematically appealing, this argument alone does not explain why T -linear resistivity remarkably survives to lower temperatures. Studies of the high T limit by Refs. [24, 25] also suggested that many aspects of T -linear behavior can be understood from high-temperature expansions.
Our key contribution is to establish a criterion for T -linear resistivity at finite temperature and to test its general validity. We begin by noting that the Kubo formula can be rewritten as,

where  is a broadening parameter whose limit must be taken to zero to recover the delta function. Once again for   0, the prefactor outside the summation yields the desired factor of . This means that the remaining terms must conspire to perfectly cancel out to have no temperature dependence. This can happen for an arbitrary range of temperatures, if f (En, |n )  f (En, |n ,   0) is constant, i.e. independent of the energy of the eigenstate and the eigenstate itself. Since there is a continuum of many-body energies and eigenstates in the thermodynamic limit, it is meaningful to coarse grain the f -function by simple averaging within a narrow energy window, as long as the energy window over which the averaging is done is significantly smaller than the lowest temperature scale of interest:

1

f(E)  g(E) (En - E)f(En, |n ),

(4)

n

where g(E)  n (En - E) is the many-body density of states (f(En, |n ) = f(En) follows from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) [26], but the coarse-grained
function is well-defined even in situations where ETH does
not hold).

For this averaged f(E), we show [26] that its energy invariance is the only generic possibility for T -linear resistivity at arbitrary temperature. This condition must hold in situations where the slope d/dT has been found to be invariant with temperature [27]. Furthermore, for resistivity scaling as other powers of T , there does not appear to be any such generic invariant that is defined in the microcanonical ensemble, which indicates that exact T -linear resistivity is somehow "special".
The f -function recasts the complex finite temperature problem into an analysis of the quantum mechanical energies and matrix elements of the current operator. In realistic models, we may expect only approximate T -linear resistivity, in which case the conditions on the f -function can be somewhat relaxed: we then expect f (E) to be constant only in energy regimes corresponding to temperatures where the T linear contribution to the resistivity dominates. At low energies we may expect to see physics associated with antiferromagnetism, superconductivity or FL behavior, and the f function can not be constant in these regimes.
To test our assertions, we carry out a systematic numerical investigation of the f -function in some well studied models. In addition to models of electrons we also pose and answer an analogous question about spin conductivity in the two dimensional spin-1/2 square lattice Heisenberg model. We also present our results for the SYK model and compare our results to the exact solution for N  .

The high temperature part of the curves (T = 30t to 70t, not shown) is fit to a linear function, the corresponding slope is shown in the inset. The low temperature physics is characterized by metallic or insulating phases which show clear deviations from T -linear resistivity.

where i, j refer to nearest neighbor pairs, t is the hopping

where Ns is the total number of sites. We simulate an isotropic lattice (4 × 4 torus i.e. periodic boundary conditions in both directions), and plot only fx (computed from Ix), since fy (computed from Iy) is identical. Since the system is finite, and the spectra discrete, a non-zero broadening parameter  is
used. Fig. 1 shows a plot of fx(E), for representative values of
V /t and fillings. The ground state energy in each case has
been subtracted out on the energy axis. A broadening parameter of  = 0.2t is used, results of other broadening parameters ( = 0.1t, 0.3t) are shown in the supplement [26]. Additionally, the energy axis is split up into bins of size  and the coarsened value of fx(E) is obtained by simple averaging over all the eigenstates with eigenenergies that lie in this bin, as in Eq. (4). The mean value of fx(E) averaged over the entire eigenspectrum is also shown as a guide to the eye.
If one focuses on the center of the many-body spectrum, fx(E) does appear to be remarkably flat for all the cases considered, especially at intermediate fillings. At half filling

(n = 8/16) and large V /t, the ground state is a known charge density wave (insulating) state with (, ) order and thus the low energy spectrum has a large region of energy space with f value  0. Similarly, at low filling (n = 4/16) we expect the low energy spectrum to be characterized by that of FL physics, correspondingly we do see significantly larger f values in this region. In the thermodynamic limit, this should manifest itself as a crossover from FL to nFL.
To quantify the degree of flatness of the f -function, we plot the histogram of fx(Ek, |k ) values for all eigenstates |k in the spectrum (assigning degenerate states the same fx-value) in the inset. We observe that (in most situations) the f -value is indeed peaked around a typical value.
Fig. 2 shows a representative set of resistivity curves for V /t = 8 and different particle fillings. For small fillings and low temperature, one has a dilute gas of well defined electronic quasiparticles, the f -function is high at low energies, correspondingly the resistivity shows deviation from T -linear behavior that is present at large T . At half filling, one has insulating behavior at low temperature expected of the CDW phase. The slope of the T -linear portion (obtained by biasing the fit to include only high temperatures) is shown in the inset and is approximately (but not exactly) constant with filling. This variation is roughly consistent with the variation of the fx values seen in Fig. 1.

Like its fermionic analog, our results in Fig. 3 on the

4 × 4 torus for different magnetizations (equivalent to fill-

ing of hard-core bosons) show that the f -function is flat when

viewed at intermediate energy. This suggests the possibility

of T -linear "spin-resistivity" in insulating magnetic materials.

FIG. 4. f -function computed for a two SYK dot system (each having N sites) using exact diagonalization for various values of N , averaged over 128 realizations each. The many-body bandwidth is Emax, and the ground state energy EGS has again been subtracted out (for each disorder realization). The dashed lines indicate f derived from the large N results for (T ) obtained in previous work [27], where we take f  (T )/T [26]. The curves will end up within the region between the dashed lines as N is made large.

single particle hopping also means that there is no Fermi liquid or glassy phase down to zero energy (zero temperature) [12, 29, 30]. Thus, the SYK model is one of the simplest known models where non-Fermi liquid physics persists all the way down to T = 0.
The concept of charge transport is not well defined for a single zero-dimensional SYK dot. However, one can weakly couple SYK dots (labeled 1, 2) with infinitesimal singleparticle hopping t (Fig. 4), and define an appropriate current operator I = it Nj=1(cj,1cj,2 - cj,2cj,1), we drop the direction label  here. Field theoretic calculations in the large N limit, where T N J by definition, have revealed that the resistivity  is linear in T [14, 15], and its slope d/dT is nearly invariant [27], i.e. it does not depend on the temperature scale (with respect to J) that the system is at, even

though the temperature dependences of other physical quantities change drastically as T is increased past J [27] (such as the compressibility, which changes from  T 0 to  T -1).
We compute the f -function of the two dot system as follows: since the hopping t is infinitesimal, the dots are effectively decoupled, and the many body states |n = |n1 |n2 are therefore (fermionic) product states of the states on the individual dots. We exactly diagonalize the Hamiltonians for the two dots individually, which have uncorrelated realizations of Jijkl. We then have (Em, Qm  Em1 , Qm1 + Em2 , Qm2 )

where g(E) is the many-body density of states of the two dot system, and the total charge on the two dots is Q.
Fig. 4 shows the results of our calculations at Q = N for N = 8 to N = 14, which were obtained after averaging over 128 realizations of Jijkl for each N . We find that in the middle of the spectrum, the f -function tends to get flatter with increasing N , approaching the large N result. Towards the edges, the f -values are smaller, but increase towards the large N result with increasing N : thus, the profile of the f -function appears to be asymptoting towards the nearly invariant large N result as N is increased. Remarkably, the f -invariance also appears to extend to energy scales E  N J in the middle of the band, far higher than those accessed in the large N field theory calculations, where E N J by definition.
Discussion: We conclude by discussing the implications of the energy invariance of the f -function, which is a purely microcanonical quantity. For this energy invariance to occur, a subtle interplay between the average size of the matrix element of the current operator and the available number of many-body states at a given energy density is required. This notion of energy scale invariance across the many-body spectrum, far beyond the purview of low energy effective field theories, is stronger than what is typically considered for quan-

5

tum criticality [31]. Furthermore, even though distinct in many regards, when viewed in terms of the many-body Hilbert space, different models suggest a universal mechanism behind T -linear resistivity.
Certain correlated electron materials display "perfect" T linear resistivity across multiple decades of temperature [32­ 35], which is often associated with the presence of a quantum critical point [36]. This resistivity goes from  h/e2 at low T , to a "bad metal" regime where  h/e2 at high T , in which the classical mean free path of the electrons becomes comparable to a lattice spacing [37]. This suggests very different physics in the two regimes [16, 38], yet f -invariance must hold across the crossover between them, indicating that they are still related. It would also be interesting to construct variational wavefunctions [39] or matrix product states for excited states in models of quantum critical metals [40] that could capture this crossover, and see how f -invariance can manifest in terms of the physical parameters used to define these wavefunctions. Also, other computational strategies based on

shift-invert based algorithms that target states at a given energy density could be used for calculation of the f - function for larger system sizes, and thus shed further light on the problem of T -linear resistivity.

I. PROOF OF f -INVARIANCE GIVEN T -LINEAR RESISTIVITY AT ALL TEMPERATURES

In the manuscript we wrote the Kubo formula for the dynamical conductivity (along direction ) as,

1 - e-

(, T ) =



n e-En f(En, |n , ) n e-En

(S1)

where the f -function was defined as,

f(En, |n , )   |Inm|2(En +  - Em)

m

 lim0

m

2

+

|Inm|2 (En +  -

Em)2

.

(S2a) (S2b)

For most generic quantum models, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) [41, 42] is expected to hold in the thermodynamic limit. Since the current operator involves only local terms, we expect that the f -function should not depend too sensitively on which state |n is used, as long as it is at a given energy E. Under these conditions, the f -function is a function of energy alone. Even in situations where ETH does not hold, it is meaningful to coarse grain the f -function by simple averaging, as long as the energy window over which the averaging is done is significantly smaller than the temperature scale of interest. We therefore study f(En, |n )  f(En, |n ,  = 0) and coarse grain it by defining,

1

f(E)  g(E) (En - E)f(En, |n ),

(S3)

n

where g(E)  n (En - E) is the many-body density of states. Working with this coarse-grained function and dropping the subscript , we now show that exact T -linear DC resistivity for
all temperatures implies that f (E) is independent of energy. First, we can easily see that if g(E) has support only at one value of E, then

T (0, T ) =

n g(En)f (En)e-En , n g(En)e-En

(S4)

is automatically independent of T , leading to exact T -linear DC resistivity. If g(E) has support at two values of E, E1

and E2, then the condition d(T (0, T ))/d = 0 gives f (E2) = f (E1), and thus exact T -linear resistivity. We can

now generalize this to a spectrum that has support at an arbitrary number of values NE > 2 of E. The conditions

d(T (0, T ))/d = 0, ... , dNE-1(T (0, T ))/dNE-1 = 0 yield a linear system of equations for f (E2), ... , f (ENE ), which

may be represented by a matrix M with entries Mmn = dmWn/dm, where Wn = g(En+1)e-En+1 /( k g(Ek)e-Ek ), as

NE -1 n=1

Mmnf (En+1)

=

-(dmW0/dm)f (E1).

Then, the columns of M are linearly independent, as linear dependence would require that  =

NE -1 n=1

anWn,

i.e.



=

NE -1 n=1

ang(En+1)e-En+1

/(

k g(Ek)e-Ek ), be independent of , as d/d = 0. This is not possible, because while

the sum in the denominator contains a term proportional to e-E1 , i.e. g(E1)e-E1 , there is no term proportional to e-E1 present in the sum in the numerator, and it is not possible to express an exponential with a given decay rate as a linear combination

of exponentials with decay rates different from the given rate. Therefore, the matrix M is invertible, and the linear system is

thus solved with a unique solution of f (E2) = ... = f (ENE ) = f (E1). A few words of caution are now in order. For approximate T -linear resistivity, the conditions on the f -function can be

relaxed, it does not strictly have to be energy invariant anymore. For example, there could be "scars" in the spectrum (one or

many atypical states which do not satisfy ETH) [43, 44] in an otherwise chaotic spectrum. As long as their contribution to

the partition function and hence the conductivity, is measure zero in the thermodynamic limit, our general statement about the

f -function should hold. Additionally, realistic models are not expected to have a perfectly constant f -value, especially at the

edges of their many-body spectra. At low energy (temperature) we expect to see physics associated with antiferromagnetism,

superconductivity or FL, thus the f -function can not be constant in this regime.

2

II. BROADENING AND BINNING FOR DYNAMICAL PROPERTIES

In the manuscript, we discussed the need for a Lorentzian broadening parameter  to evaluate the conductivity, and the f -

function. In Fig. S1, S2 and S3 we present more data for the f - function for both the spinless Hubbard and Heisenberg models

for different . We also use this section to show results for other representative particle fillings or magnetizations not presented

in the manuscript.

For the spinless Hubbard and Heisenberg models, the calculation proceeds in two steps. In the first step we evaluate

fx(En, |n ) using the Lorentzian approximation to the delta function. Each eigenstate thus has a f - value associated with it. If there is an exact degeneracy, we average the f - values for all states in the degenerate subspace and assign each state the
same f -value. Once all the f -values are obtained, we plot their histogram which has been shown in the inset of our plots. This

allows us to visually inspect how flat the f -function is. In the second step, we compute the coarse grained function by discretiz-

ing energy in units of . The f -values of all eigenstates (computed in step 1) that lie in the energy window (,  + ) (where

 = 0, 1, 2... is an integer) are averaged to yield f

E=



+

1 2

 . This coarse-grained function is plotted in the main panels

of our figures.

We have also explored a different coarse graining protocol, based on simple (box) binning of energy space. In this procedure all eigenstates are organized into bins of width . The f(E) function is evaluated using,

1



f E =

+  2

=  × Number of states in bin 

|Inm|2

(S5)

m,nin same bin 

where  = 0, 1, 2... is an integer and represents the bin number for energies in the range  to ( + 1). Representative results of this binning protocol for the 4 × 4 2D Heisenberg model are shown in Fig S4. We observe that
the f - function is indeed flat. However, for the same  there is a difference between the box and Lorentzian protocols which gets smaller for large Hilbert spaces and small . This is not too surprising, since the box protocol ignores inter-bin current contributions, an effect that becomes smaller for smaller bin widths , and with larger number of eigenstates, both of which are required to reach the true continuum limit.

III. DETAILS OF COMPUTATION OF f (E) FOR SYK

For the SYK calculations, the large number of eigenstates on both dots combined makes the implementation of the full

Lorentzian no longer computationally feasible. Instead, we used the box binning method mentioned above, and computed the

coarse grained function directly without evaluating f (En, |n ). For each realization of the random couplings Jijkl, we defined a grid of energy points 0, E, ... , Emax - E, Emax, where
Emax is the many-body bandwidth of the two dot system, and the ground state energy EGS is subtracted out so that the smallest energy is zero. We took E  Emax/50. Then, for each E point, we defined a bin centered at it of width , that is the smaller of E and the width required for the bin to contain approximately 500 states. We performed a binary search to determine the

appropriate value of  for each value of E, and then computed f (E) according to Eq. (S5). Finally we averaged the values of

f (E) at these grid points over several realizations of Jijkl. While diagonalizing each of the two SYK dots, we ignore the states that have 0, 1, N - 1, or N particles on a dot. For a total

of N particles on the two dots (half filling), these states are all at zero energy, and are irrelevant in the large N limit, as they then

form a vanishingly small subset of the total Hilbert space. However, at small N  10, they do create a visible artifact in f (E)

in the middle of the many-body band, which vanishes as N is increased, as it should. By ignoring these states, this distracting

artifact is removed from the plots of f (E) even for small N .

Finally, [27] have

we remark on shown, in the

how we obtained the large large N limit, that T (0,

NT )re=sulNtstf2or f (/E2

) in for

SYK T

in Fig. 4 J, and

of the T (0,

Tm)ainte1x.t0. 5ANnta2lytic/c2alfcourlaJtions

T N J. Since f -invariance is required for T -linear resistivity over extended energy regimes, it follows that we can substitute

the values of T (0, T ) (or (T )/T ) for f (E) in the corresponding energy regimes. Remarkably, our numerics suggest that

f -invariance continues to hold as one enters the even higher energy regime of E  N J, i.e. the middle of the many-body band.

S4. fx(E) for the spin conductivity of the 4 × 4 2D square lattice nearest neighbor spin 1/2 Heisenberg model using the box binning protocol, with bin size ;  = 0.10J (top row),  = 0.20J (middle row) and  = 0.30J (bottom row). The representative magnetizations (equivalently fillings of spin-up particles in a sea of down spins, denoted by n) chosen are identical to the Lorentzian protocol. In each case, the ground state energy EGS has been subtracted out.
