## Abstract

We use the notion of the gauge/string duality and discuss the Liouvillian (non)integrability criteria for string sigma models in the context of recently proposed Arutyunov-Bassi-Lacroix (ABL) model [JHEP \textbf{03} (2021), 062]. Our analysis complements these previous results due to numerical analysis as well as Lax pair formulation. We consider a winding string ansatz for the deformed torus $T^{\qty(\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},\lambda)}_{k}$ which can be interpreted as a system of coupled pendulums. Our analysis reveals the Liouvillian nonintegrablity of the associated sigma model. We also obtain the \emph{generalized} decoupling limit and confirm the analytic integrability for the decoupled sector.
