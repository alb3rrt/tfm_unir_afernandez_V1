## Abstract

Today's intelligent applications can achieve high performance accuracy using machine learning (ML) techniques, such as deep neural networks (DNNs). Traditionally, in a remote DNN inference problem, an edge device transmits raw data to a remote node that performs the inference task. However, this may incur high transmission energy costs and puts data privacy at risk. In this paper, we propose a technique to reduce the total energy bill at the edge device by utilizing model compression and time-varying model split between the edge and remote nodes. The time-varying representation accounts for time-varying channels and can significantly reduce the total energy at the edge device while maintaining high accuracy (low loss). We implement our approach in an image classification task using the MNIST dataset, and the system environment is simulated as a trajectory navigation scenario to emulate different channel conditions. Numerical simulations show that our proposed solution results in minimal energy consumption and $CO_2$ emission compared to the considered baselines while exhibiting robust performance across different channel conditions and bandwidth regime choices.
