INTERIOR CONTROLLABILITY OF SURFACE GRAVITY WAVES AND THE SLOSHING PROBLEM
M. A. FONTELOS AND J. LO´ PEZ-R´IOS
Abstract. We study the problem of controlling the free surface, by fluid jets on the boundary, for a two dimensional solid container in the context of the gravity waves and the sloshing problem. By using conformal maps and the Dirichlet­Neumann operator, the problem is formulated as a second order evolutionary equation on the free surface involving a self-adjoint operator. We present then the appropriate Sobolev spaces where having solutions for the system and study the exact controllability through an observability inequality for the adjoint problem.

Roughly speaking, controlling a system consist not only in testing that its behavior is satisfactory, but also

in putting things in order to guarantee that it behaves as desired. In mathematical terms, controlling the

state y, ruled by the state equation

A(y) = f (v),

where v is the control, consists in finding v  Uad, the set of admissible controls, such that the solution to the equation gets close to a desired prescribed state, y¯.

In this paper, we study the interior exact controllability of a Partial Differential Equation (PDE), in the

context of controlling the oscillations of a liquid free surface in a two-dimensional bounded container and the

so-called sloshing problem. We formulate the geometrical problem in terms of an integrodifferential equation

by using the Hilbert transform, then we establish the appropriate Sobolev spaces to study existence of

solutions for the eigenvalue problem and, finally, we set up an observability inequality for the homogeneous

adjoint problem. The sloshing problem adduces to an important difference with respect to the classical

water-waves formulation: the presence of vertical walls and the contact with the free surface. Inspired in

the developments for the classical wave equation, we introduce analytical tools to prove that it is possible

to control the oscillations of the free surface, by injecting fluid on the rigid side walls.

The main strengths of our method lie in the use of the Hilbert transform to formulate the problem as

an evolutionary and has proved

instance). Moreover, the use of Tchebyshev polynomials provides an explicit orthogonal basis which allows

to study, analytically, the associated eigenvalue problem. Then, an observability inequality arises naturally.

Generally speaking, the water-waves problem for an ideal liquid consists of describing the motion of a

layer of incompressible, inviscid fluid, delimited below by a solid bottom, and above by a free surface under

the influence of gravity. In mathematical termlas,nnifesu2(0x13, wya)tiesrthe fluid velocity and  is the velocity potential such that u = , by the conservation laws [13]

the free­end boundary conditions. We will consider both and will impose conditions on the Cauchy problem

to deal with it, accordingly.

When we talk about the controllability by fluid injection, we mean the condition

 n

j,

for a given function j = j(t, x), with n being the outward normal vector. This boundary condition lead

to think of a boundary control of the gravity waves problem; nevertheless, we will restate the problem

as an integrodifferential equation on the free surface and the boundary condition becomes a source term.

map into the lower half­plane. We link the normal derivative to the specific conformal map and rewrite the

profbolnetmelaoss2a02s0egcroanvditoyrder evolution equation on the interval [-1, 1], where the Hilbert transform is involved. In [8], we used this approach to propkoisme20a1n5ceaffipiclileanrtycomputational method to find the sloshing frequencies on general 2d domains. We mention [12] where the capillary version of the problem is developed, under the

context of the oscillations in a nozzle of an inkjet printer. In these works, two possibilities for the contact

line were considered: the `pinned-end edge condition', where the contact line is always pinned to the solid

surface, and the `free-end condition' where the contact angle between the fluid­air interface and the side

walls is fixed and the contact line is allowed to move, with contact angle /2. godoy2008modeling By addressing this problem, we give an answer to a question raised in [9]; namely, the problem of

controlling undesirable splashing appearing in a cooper converter when air is injected into the molten matte.

There, the authors studied the problem numerically by using triangular finite elements to mesh the bounded

domain, on a damped linear gravity waves model. Controlling interest in oceanography, controllability and inverse problems

Sobolev frame where the Cauchy problem is well-posed and study there the eigenvalue associated problem.

We also prove an observability inequality for the adjoint problem and explore the possibility of finding

explicit controls taking the oscillations at the free surface to zero.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In 2 we formulate the general equations to be considered,

the linearization approach and corresponding formulation on the half-plane by the conformal mapping. In

3 we use the Hilbert transform to state a second order evolutionary PDE modeling the dynamics of the

fluid interface on the bounded domain [-1, 1]. In 4 we make use of the Tchebyshev polynomials to study

the stationary adjoint problem in suitable Sobolev spaces. In 5 we prove an observability inequality for the

adjoint problem. Finally, in 6 we establish the controllability of the problem and explore the possibility of

determining possible control functions, explicitly.

2. Formulation S2
Let us consider a two dimensional container, filled with water, bounded from above by a free surface. In this context, the motion is governed by the incompressible Euler equations with zero surface tension:

 · u = 0,

with -ge2 being the constant acceleration of gravity, g > 0, and e2 the unit upward vector in the vertical
direction,  is the (constant) density of the fluid and p is the pressure inside. We use the classical notation (x, y)  R2 and z = x + iy for complex numbers.

will allow us to obtain a single, explicit, evolutionary conservation law on the free surface modeling the fluid

dynamics of the free surface side bounded by vertical solid walls. This equation must be complemented by
boundary conditions as explained in 3. Even if we consider the reference domain  = {(x, y)  D : y < 0}, other domains can be considered

though. Let

(t, x) = (t, x).

Then if

The

Dirichlet-Neumann

operator.

Let us consider in this section the

basic situation when

 n

= 0,

on

the solid walls

of

the domain

.

The value of

 n

at the

fluid interface

may be viewed

as

the result of

an operator (the so-called Dirichlet-Neumann operator) acting on the function  restricted to the interface.

We are going to deduce a few simple consequences obtained from the properties of this operator. Keeping

in mind the equation (8), we can easily deduce the following mass conservation relation:

The equation (34) may be rewritten as an identical equation for  after taking an additional time derivative
afonndtewlorsit2i0n2g0grtav=it-y . We remark again that the formulation (34) is equivalent to the formulation given in [8] (see (A)).
We need to complement (34) with suitable initial and boundary conditions, namely

(0, x) = 0(x), t(0, x) = 1(x),

where, by mass conservation (eq. (21))

1 -1

1(x) |f (x)|

dx

=

1 -1

 (x ) |f (x)|

dx

=

0.

(35)

Moreover, from (25), (26), we impose on the initial data:

1 0,x(x) dx = 0, -1 1 - x2

(36)

1 x0,x(x) dx = 0, -1 1 - x2

(37)

which are automatically fulfilled by defining an initial normal derivative 0,y(x) with vanishing mean value in [-1, 1] and the corresponding tangential derivative 0,x(x) defined by (23).
In the case when |f (x)| is a symmetric function (corresponding to a symmetric domain ) it is useful to

think of (t, x) as decomposed into symmetric and antisymmetric part; that is

(t, x) = S(t, x) + N (t, x)

with

S(t, x)

=

(t, x)

+ (t, 2

-x)

,

and the initial data decomposed accordingly

N (t, x)

=

(t,

x)

- (t, 2

S1(x)

=

1(x)

+ 1(-x) 2

,

N1(x)

(-x)

.

Then, one can consider the evolution problem for symmetric and antisymmetric functions separately. For symmetric functions, the initial data need to satisfy (35), (37) while for antisymmetric functions the conditions are (35), (36). Finally, we remark that (35), (36), (37) do not only hold initially, but for any time by replacing (0(x), 1(x)) by ((t, x), t(t, x)).
We discuss now on boundary conditions for (34). Two kind of conditions are customary: pinned end and

free end boundary conditions. In pinned end conditions one imposes (t, ±1) = 0, and since t = -, this implies

(t, ±1) = 0 (pinned-end boundary condition).

In the case of free-end boundary conditions one imposes x(t, ±1) = 0 and since xt = x this translates into the condition

x(t, ±1) = 0 (free-end boundary condition).

(39)

We discuss now the case with fluid injection, i.e. with the condition (14) where the flux j is such

We define now the operator T such that  = T v. If we view T as an operator from L2|f(x)|-1 to L2|f(x)|-1 ,
1
since Hw2-1,0  L2w-1  L2|f(x)|-1, we can see that T is a selfadjoint operator (due to the selfadjoint
1
character of A) and also a compact operator (due to the compact embedding Hw2-1,0  L2w-1 (see (B)) and the continuous inclusion L2w-1  L2|f(x)|-1) . Moreover, ker(T ) = {0} and

for any v  L2|f|-1. Therefore, by the spectral decomposition theorem, L2|f|-1 admits a Hilbert basis {en} formed by eigenvectors of T , with eigenvalues µn such that µn > 0 and µn  0 as n  . We have then

This implies en is a weak solution to the eigenvalue problem (43) with  = n = µ-n 1. The base can be made orthonormal, i.e.

1 -1

eiej |f (x

dx

=

Let us remark that condition (55) is satisfied provided the angles 1,2 between the fluid interface and the

solid container satisfy

1,2



 2

,

since |f (x)| has a singularity weaker (i.e. with larger exponent) than |x ± 1|1/2 otherwise [a2s]m.ar2002applied

We summarize the results above in the following theorem:

Theorem 1. Let  be a domain such that the interior angles between the free liquid interface and the solid are greater or equal than /2. There exist a Hilbert basis {en}n1 of L2|f|-1 and a sequence {n}n1 of real numbers with n > 0 n and n  + such that
1

.

As a final remark, notice that for bounded symmetric |f (x)|, one has L2|f(x)|-1  L2 and hence vectors in

L2|f|-1 may be expanded in trigonometric basis of L2. Using the base {sin(nx)} n=1 one can approximate an-

tisymmetric eigenfunctions (solutions to (43)) with pinned contact lines while the set cos

(with the extra mass conservation condition also imposed) allows to approximate symmetric eigenfunctions.

Likewise, the sets

and

{cos(nx)} n=1

allow

to find antisymmetric

and

symmetric

eigenfunctions with free-end condition. This approach was followed in [8], in order to compute eigenvalues

and eigenfunctions numerically for various domains.

5. Observability and energy estimates S5

We will consider next the control problem consisting of finding h(t, x) in equation (41) such that for given initial data the solution vanishes at some time T . As it is customary in controllability theory, we need to consider first the homogeneous adjoint problem and obtain observability estimates.
The analysis presented above allows us to consider the solution in (0, T ) of the following homogeneous adjoint problem (see (34))

tt |f |

(57) o1

with suitable initial conditions (0) = 0, (0) = 1, whose solution we can write as

Once we have studied in the previous sections the forward evolution equation and the backward homogeneous system, given by (62) and (57) respectively, we are in position of comparing them to get the controllability condition on the system.

CONTROL OF SURFACE GRAVITY WAVES

We are going to discuss next on how to approach the control function h, defined at the fluid interface by means of a function j defined at the solid boundaries. This function j will represent a fluid injection at certain points {x1, x2, ..., xN } of the solid boundary with a flow rate {j1(t), j2(t), ..., jN (t)} and under the mass conservation condition
