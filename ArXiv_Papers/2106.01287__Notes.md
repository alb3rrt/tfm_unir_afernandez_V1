## Abstract

We propose a novel fiber-based environmental sensor that exploits the reflection phase shift tunability provided by the use of layered coatings composed of dielectric slabs spaced by conducting membranes. A transfer matrix study is done in a simplified theoretical model, for which an enhanced sensitivity of the reflection interference pattern to the output medium is demonstrated, in the typical refractive index range of liquid media. An experimental configuration using a cascaded Fabry-Perot microcavity coated by a graphene oxide/polyethylenimine (GO/PEI) multilayered structure is demonstrated. Its cost effective chemical production method makes graphene oxide-based hybrid coatings excellent candidates for future real-life sensing devices.
