## Abstract

We report observations of the total solar eclipse of 14 December 2020, during which a coronal mass ejection can be see n propagating. A comprehensive set of photographs covering a high dynamic range of exposure allow to characterize its dimensions. The displacement of the front can be seen occurring during the few minutes of totality.
