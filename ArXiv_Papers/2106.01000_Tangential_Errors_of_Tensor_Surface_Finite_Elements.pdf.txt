Abstract. We discretize a tangential tensor field equation using a surface-finite element approach with a penalization term to ensure almost tangentiality. It is natural to measure the quality of such a discretization intrinsically, i.e., to examine the tangential convergence behavior in contrast to the normal behavior. We show optimal order convergence with respect to the tangential quantities in particular for an isogeometric penalization term that is based only on the geometric information of the discrete surface.

1 Introduction

We consider the following model problem: Let  be a closed d-dimensional surface

embedded in Rd+1. Given tensor-valued data f , the goal is to find tensor fields u that

solve

- u + u = f on  .

Here,  is the connection-Laplacian, the natural extension of the Laplace-Beltrami operator to tensor fields based on covariant derivatives.
We study this problem in a variational setting: Find u  H1(, Tn) such that

(u, v) + (u, v) = (f , v) v  H1(, Tn) ,

(2)

with Tn the rank n = k + l tensor bundle of k-covariant and l-contravariant tensors,  the covariant derivative, and f  L2(, Tn) the given data.

This problem is related to the minimization of the full covariant H1-norm of tensor fields and has applications in the area of nematic Liquid crystals described by surface Qtensor fields, e.g., [3, 32, 34, 35], orientation field computation on flexible manifolds and shells, e.g., [33, 40, 36], the time-discretisation of the vector and tensor-heat equation, e.g., [7, 8, 41], and surface Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations, e.g., [38, 39, 15, 25, 18, 23, 26, 27, 4, 43].

1.1 Description of the numerical discretization
Let h be a piecewise polynomial approximation of the continuous surface , with local polynomial order kg and triangulation Kh. We introduce the surface Lagrange finite element space Vh of local Lagrange elements of order ku on , see, [9]. The product space Vh = [Vh]N with N = (d + 1)n is the base for the discretization of tensor fields uh : h  TnRd+1 in the ambient space.
These discrete tensor fields are not necessarily tangential to h nor to . In order to introduce a discrete formulation for (2), we project the non-tangential tensors into the tangent space of the discrete surface. This tensor projection is denoted by Ph and is built from the discrete surface normal field nh.
Posing an equation with tangential operators only for tensors in the ambient space results in a non-trivial kernel of the bilinear form. Thus, we introduce a penalization of normal contributions in the tensor fields. The normal projection is defined as the orthogonal projection to Ph, i.e., Qh = Id -Ph. We use the notation Qh,kp for a normal projection build from a normal vector nh,kp that approximates the exact surface normal n with order kp, with typically kp  kg, cf. [20].
Following these ideas, we formulate the discrete variational problem: Find uh  Vh such that

Ah(uh, vh) := (h Phuh, h Phvh)Kh + (Phuh, Phvh)Kh + h-2 Qh,kp uh, Qh,kp vh Kh = (f e, Phvh)Kh

vh  Vh , (3)

where the inner products and derivatives have to be understood elementwise. Here,   [0, 1] and  > 0 are parameters of the penalization term. The parameters kg, ku, kp  1, and  play a crucial role in the discussion of the errors of this discretization. The righthand side function f e  L2(h, TnRd+1) denotes a proper extension of the continuous surface field f . The operator h|K = K denotes the covariant tensor derivative on the smooth elements K  Kh of the discrete surface h. It can be represented by the projected Euclidean derivative D applied to the tensor fields and a normal correction term, i.e., hPhuh = PhDuh - PhDQhuh. This representation leads to an easy to implement numerical scheme.
An extrinsic discretization similar to the one described here is introduced by Nestler et al. [35] for tensor fields on piecewise flat surfaces and is analyzed by Hansbo et al. [20] for vector fields on parametrized surfaces. Both approaches are based on surface finite elements for the discretization of the components of those embedded tensors. The problem is also considered in the context of discretization methods with a natural embedding

structure, like Trace-FEM or Cut-FEM, for vector-valued PDEs, e.g., [28, 19, 5, 24]. In contrast to methods with an extrinsic representations of the tensor fields, some groups consider intrinsic tensor and vector field parametrizations and discretizations, e.g., a local Monge parametrization, see, [42], a tensor hodge-decomposition in combination with discrete exterior calculus discretizations, e.g., [8, 29, 21], a direct intrinsic parametrization of the surface, e.g., [2, 1], or an extension of spherical harmonics to tangential tensor fields on the sphere, e.g., [22, 45, 14]. These approaches either lack a numerical analysis altogether, or they are restricted in their applicability by being only valid for vector fields, by needing higher order smoothness of the discrete surface, or by using properties of flat or spherical geometries. Some of these approaches consider discretisation methods of lower order, only.
While the analysis of the vector field discretizations has advanced far already, see, [20], tensor field discretizations are only experimentally considered, e.g., [35, 42]. Our study extends the results of Hansbo et al. [20] to arbitrary type tensor fields. Hansbo et al. [20] claim in the conclusion that "it is of course also of interest to investigate the convergence behavior for the tangential part of the solution. [. . .] Tangential convergence is arguably more natural to consider as we [. . .] seek to approximate a tangential vector field.". While numerical evidence that there is optimal order convergence for tangential L2-errors is given, the behavior is not proven. A further drawback of their approach is that optimal convergence orders are only obtained if higher order geometry approximations for the penalization term are available. This means that for piecewise flat surface approximations there is no convergence at all. We fill these gaps and additionally prove estimates for the tangential H1-errors. In order to do so, we introduce a more flexible choice of penalization term that also allows to analyze the experimental results of Nestler et al. [34, 35].
In summary,
1. we are investigating an elliptic reference problem for tensor fields on surfaces and show that the analysis for vector fields can be generalized in a straightforward way to higher tensorial rank without loosing convergence orders;
2. we investigate the tangential L2- and H1-norm errors of the discrete solution of the reference problem showing a possible improvement with respect to the results by Hansbo et al. [20], in particular when higher order approximations of the surface are not readily available;
3. we allow for flexibility in the penalization term and show that the popular choice of scaling by  h-2 is not optimal in multiple interesting cases;
4. we show that even for the piecewise flat surface approximation a converging numerical scheme can be constructed.
1.2 Main results
In this paper we analyze the error between the solution u of the continuous problem (2) and the solution uh  Vh of the discrete problem (3) lifted to the continuous surface,
3

u - uh, in various norms. The first estimate is in the energy norm |||eh|||2Ah = Ah(eh, eh). Assume that we have
u  Htkaun+1() the solution of the continuous problem, then we get the estimate
|||ue - uh|||Ah hm f  + u Htkaun+1() ,
with m = min{ku, kg +  - 1, kp - }, shown in Theorem 4.1. Note that the geometric part of the error, given by the term O(hkg+-1), is of lower order than a corresponding error contribution for scalar surface finite elements, cf. [9]. This is due to the additional projections involved for vector and tensor fields in all the terms of the discrete problem (3). For   {0, 1} the last two terms coming from the penalty contribution result in an even lower order convergence, i.e., kg - 1 or kp - 1. In a former analysis by Hansbo et al. [20] this could only be compensated by setting  = 1 and increasing kp. Allowing for a variable , we see that for the linear setting kp = kg = 1 we still get convergence if we choose 1 >  > 0, with the optimum  = 1/2.
As one is often only interested in the tangential norms, we also consider the H1-norm of the tangential part of the error. We observe an improvement from the energy norm estimate in many cases. In particular, we prove

P (u - uh) Ht1an() hm^ f  + u Htkaun+1()
with m^ = min{ku, kg, kg + kp - 2, kg - 1 + 2} in Theorem 4.2. We observe that this estimate is optimal for  = 1/2, and the order will be min{ku, kg} in this case. This corresponds to the optimal order that we see in numerical experiments in Section 5. Note that this is especially an improvement from the energy norm estimate for the typical choice   {0, 1} in the isogeometric case kg = kp.
From the estimate in the energy norm and the estimate in the tangential H1-norm we deduce further improvements in the corresponding L2-norms. In particular we prove

(Id -P ) (u - uh)  P (u - uh) 

hm+ f  + u Htkaun+1() , hmin{m^ +1,m~ } f  + u Htkaun+1() ,

with m~ := min{kg + 1, 2m, m + 3 - } in Theorem 4.3. For kg  2, we again see that the optimal order of min{ku + 1, kg + 1} for the tangential part is obtained by choosing  = 1/2. Only for the case kg = 1 and kp  2, the choice  = 1/2 is sub-optimal as it only provides a convergence order of 1 that can be improved to 2 by choosing  = 1. If one is mainly interested in a better convergence of the normal part of the error and if it is possible to choose kp  kg + 1, there will also be an improvement by choosing  greater than 1/2. In this case  = 1 will yield the optimal order of convergence of min{ku + 1, kg + 1} for the full L2-norm.
All results are backed up by the numerical experiments in Section 5. We observe the claimed optimal order for  = 1/2. However, the optimal order can be obtained for more cases than in the analytical estimates, in particular for even choices of kg. This is not covered by this paper.

1.3 Outline of the paper
We start this paper by introducing the notation and collecting fundamental results for discrete surfaces and tensor fields in the beginning of Section 2. This section is closed by introducing Sobolev spaces for tensor fields on continuous and discrete surfaces. The following Section 3 focusses on the variational problem (2) and its finite element discretization (3). The error analysis of the discrete problem is discussed in Section 4. This is followed by numerical experiments in Section 5 confirming the found theoretical results.

2 Tensor fields on surfaces
We study tensor-valued PDEs on curved surfaces. Therefore, we need to introduce notation for tensor fields and clarify the assumptions on the surface properties needed to make the assertion of geometrical and discretization errors. This section also covers some basic estimates for general tensor fields on the continuous and corresponding approximate discrete surface and the relation between these fields and surfaces.

2.1 Surface and discrete surface approximation
First, we introduce the notion of hypersurfaces and their approximation by piecewise polynomial discrete surfaces. This section covers definitions and general geometric estimates.

2.1.1 The smooth surface
Let  be a compact, oriented, closed, and C, d-dimensional hypersurface, isometrically embedded in Rd+1. Let T denote the tangential vector bundle of . We introduce for each point x   the ambient tangent space TxRd+1 = Rd+1 as the space of Rd+1 vectors with origin in x. This space locally splits into an orthogonal direct sum Rd+1 = Tx  Nx, where Nx is the normal space at x. We denote the normal bundle by N . As we consider hypersurfaces only, and  is oriented, we can pick out the unique
outward pointing normal n(x) at each point x  . This normal vector field induces projection operators P(x) = Id -n(x)n(x) into the tangent space Tx and Q(x) = n(x)  n(x) into the normal space Nx.
Let U  Rd+1 be a -neighborhood of  with  > 0 sufficiently small such that the closest-point projection  : U   from this neighborhood to  is unique. The projection mapping is defined by

(x) := x - (x)n(x)

(4)

where  is the signed distance function with (x) < 0 for x in the interior of . With this distance function the surface normal vector field is naturally extended to U by n := D with D the (componentwise) Euclidean derivative and n = n|. As P is defined in terms of n, we introduce the extended projections P and Q defined in terms of n.

5

The extended normal vector also allows to define the extended Weingarten map on the surface and in U, by W := -Dn.

2.1.2 Approximation of the surface

Let ^h  U be a shape-regular, quasi-uniform triangulated surface with element diameter h and vertices on . We denote by K^h the set of triangular faces of ^h. On this
piecewise flat triangulated surface the usual m-th order Lagrange finite element spaces

can be defined by

V^hm =. V^hm(^h, R) := v  C0(^h) | v|K^  PKm^ , K^  K^h ,

(5)

where PKm^ denotes the space of polynomials of degree at most m on K^ . Note that PKm^ is

defined as the mapping of polynomials Pm from a flat d-dimensional reference element Kref  Rd to the flat surface element K^  Rd+1. For vector-valued maps we use the

notation

V^hm(^h, RN ) := V^hm N ,

(6)

that has to be understood as a componentwise definition. We consider the restriction of the closest-point projection  to ^h as a mapping  :
^h  Rd+1. Its componentwise Lagrange interpolation I^hk into V^hk(^h, Rd+1) is denoted by h,k. Mapping the piecewise flat surface results in a higher-order approximation h,k := h,k(^h) of the surface  that is contained in U if h is small enough. In the following we assume that h is chosen correspondingly. Note that h,1 = ^h. Associated
to the discrete surface h,k is a set of surface elements

Kh,k := h,k(K^ ) | K^  K^h ,
such that h,k = KKh,k K¯ . In the lines of the construction of the parametrized surface h,k by mapping the
reference surface ^h by h,k, we can also obtain the continuous surface  by lifting the discrete surface as  = (h,k). This induces a partitioning of  in surface elements

K := (K) | K  Kh,k ,
such that  = KK K¯ . For details about the construction and its properties, see, e.g., [9, 12, 37].

2.1.3 Properties of the discrete surface

For the parametrized surface h,kg with polynomial order kg  1 and discrete surface normal vector nh it is shown that the following geometric estimates hold [9, Proposition 2.3]:

 - h,kg L(h,kg ) hkg+1,

(7)

n - nh L(h,kg ) hkg ,

(8)

Dn - Dneh L(K) hkg-1,

(9)

6

with a b means a  C b with C a constant independent of h. K  Kh,kg denotes an element of the triangulation of h,kg and neh = nh  (|h,kg )-1   an extension of nh into the neighborhood of K.
The estimate (9) can even be generalized to Dln - Dlneh L(K) hkg-l for all 0  l  kg and can be proven analogously to the case l = 1 [9, Proposition 2.3] using
interpolation error estimates for h,kg . As we need only the estimate for l = 0, 1, we refrain from stating this more explicitly although generalizations of several lemmata in Section 4.1 are possible. In the following we denote by h =. h,kg the parametrized surface approximation of order kg and denote all other quantities on this discrete surface
with the subscript h dropping the explicit notation of kg.
Due to the construction of K, each element K  K has a one-to-one association to
a discrete element K  Kh in the triangulation of h. The corresponding coordinate
association is defined in terms of the closest-point projection . As in the definition of
the continuous normal field, we lift nh from h to  and extend to the neighborhood U by nh := neh. Note that nh|h = nh. This extension also defines discrete projections Ph = Id -nh  nh and Qh = Id -Ph.

2.1.4 Derivative of the closest-point projection

At every x^  h inside an element, the differential of the mapping  : h   is a bijective function, dx^ : Tx^h  T(x^). We denote by x = (x^) the associated point on . In extrinsic coordinates, dx^ is given by

B(x^) := Dh(x^) = P (x)(Id +(x^)W(x))Ph(x^), and the inverse of B is given explicitly by

B-1(x) = Ph(x^)

Id - n(x)  nh(x^) n(x), nh(x^)

(Id +(x^)W(x))-1P (x).

It is easy to check that B(x^)B-1(x) = P (x) for and B-1(x)B(x^) = Ph(x^) for x^  h and x = (x^).
The following Lemma summarizes geometric estimates for the mapping B and its inverse in relation to the projection operators P and Ph. These estimates allow the comparison of covariant derivatives on the different surfaces.

Lemma 2.1 (Estimates involving B, B-1 and det B). Let  and h be as above. Then there exist constants independent of the grid-size h such that we have for B and B-1 the
estimates

B L(h)  C , P Ph - B L(h) hkg+1 ,

B-1 L()  C , PhP - B-1 L() hkg+1 ,

and for the surface measures d = |det(B)| dh the estimates

1 - |det(B)| L(h) hkg+1 , |det(B)| L(h)  C ,

|det(B)|-1 L(h)  C .

7

Furthermore, we have

BBT - P L() hkg+1 ,

B-T B-1 - Ph L(h)

Proof. See [20, Lemma 4.1] and [12, Lemma 4.4].

hkg+1 .

Remark 2.1. For kg = 1 the discrete surface h coincides with the reference surface ^h. We denote by B^ the corresponding derivative of . The closest-point projection  on ^h is bounded, i.e.,

 C(K^ )  C,

|-^h1 C(K)  C

(10)

for K^  K^h and K  K. The first boundedness follows from the smoothness of  and the second estimate by boundedness of the first derivative B^-1 of  and chain rule.

Lemma 2.2 (Boundedness of the discrete projection derivatives). Let the derivative of the discrete mapping h on ^h be denoted by

B^h := D^h h = D^h Ihkg |^h .

Then, boundedness of B^h and its inverse B^h-1 w.r.t. the corresponding C0 norm holds, i.e., B^h-1 C0(Kh)  C, for Kh  Kh. As a consequence we have boundedness of the

discrete projections:

h C(K^ )  C,

h-1 C(Kh)  C

for K^  K^h and Kh  Kh with generic constants C independent of h.

Proof. The boundedness of h follows directly from continuity of the interpolation operator Ihkg and smoothness of . For B^h-1 we write

B^h-1(h(x^)) = B^-1((x^)) B^(x^) - B^h(x^) B^h-1(h(x^)) + B^-1((x^))Ph(h(x^)),

and estimate using interpolation-error estimates
B^h-1 C0(Kh)  B^-1 C0(K) B^h - B^ C0(K^ ) B^-1 C0(Kh) + B^-1 C0(K)  C hkg B^-1 C0(Kh) + B^-1 C0(K) .
For h small enough, we can compensate the first term into the left-hand side and by (10) get the desired boundedness. Higher order estimates then follow from the chain rule.

2.2 Tensor fields
While intrinsic tensor fields are described in terms of the surface intrinsic metric and a basis of the tangential space, we aim for an extrinsic description in terms of the basis of the Rd+1. This allows for a global simple parametrization and representation of continuous fields and gives rise to a corresponding representation of non-intrinsic fields with normal components.

8

2.2.1 Tensors and tensor fields
We denote by e1, . . . , ed+1  Rd+1 the canonical basis of Rd+1. Their projections into T introduces a local spanning set p1(x) := P (x)e1, . . . , pd+1(x) := P (x)ed+1 for x  . For each tangent vector field V  T we denote the representation in extrinsic coordinates V (x) = V i(x)ei = V i(x)pi(x) by V (x) = [V i(x)]i with coordinate functions V i :   R. This extrinsic representation induces a canonical (Frobenius) inner product V, W :=
i V i W i. Similarly, elements f of the tangential tensor bundle Tn of rank-n contravariant tensors have a representation in extrinsic coordinates by
f (x) = f i1,...,in (x) ei1  · · ·  ein = f i1,...,in (x) pi1 (x)  · · ·  pin (x) ,
with f (x) = [f i1,...,in(x)]i1,...,in. This representation induces the canonical inner product V1  V2, W1  W2 := V1, W1 V2, W2 . The tangent bundle T  T1 is represented by the rank-1 tensor bundle. The space of tensors with smooth coefficient functions f i1,...,in  C(, R) defines the space of smooth tensor fields f  T n.
For each x   we denote by TnxRd+1 the non-tangential tensors that can be seen as product of Euclidean spaces, i.e., TnxRd+1 = R(d+1)n and the corresponding tensor bundle is denoted by TnRd+1. With TRd+1  T1Rd+1 the ambient tangent space is given.
Remark 2.2. We do not distinguish between covariant and contravariant tensors here in this manuscript. All the tensor fields are represented w.r.t. an Euclidean basis. Thus, raising and lowering of indices is an index contraction with the Kronecker delta tensor. For simplicity of notation we mostly work with contravariant index position here and just write the full tensor rank n instead of separation by covariant and contravariant type.
Remark 2.3. In most parts of this manuscript we implicitly assume n > 0 and thus exclude scalar fields. Those are special cases analyzed elsewhere, e.g., [9].
Definition 2.1 (Tensor projection). The tangential projection P = Id -nn is extended to a projection of (non-tangential) tensor fields f = f i1,...,inei1  . . .  ein  T nRd+1 by
P f := f i1,...,in P ei1  . . .  P ein = f i1,...,in pi1  . . .  pin .
The tensor projection is defined as an operator projecting all components of the tensor using the tangential projection. The projected tensor is a tangential tensor. For vector fields V the tensor projection corresponds to the usual tangential projection, P V = P V , for 2-tensor fields f it corresponds to a row and column projection, P f = P f P .
Definition 2.2 (Discrete tensor projection). We denote by Ph the tensor projection into the tangent space of h, defined in terms of Ph = Id -nh  nh elementwise similar to Definition 2.1. Those elementwise projections are formally glued together to define a projection operator for tensor fields on h.
9

Remark 2.4. Note, on the facets in the intersection of two elements, there is no tangent space defined and thus also no tangential projection. In the finite element method the (bi)linear forms are defined elementwise and quadrature typically is performed in the inside of the elements. Thus, this definition is no restriction for the practical implementation. However, in the analysis one has to be careful, e.g., when considering interpolation of projected fields. Often continuity is required for interpolation operators.
In order to compare tensor fields on  and h we choose particular extensions and lifts. Those are defined in terms of the closest-point projection  : U  .
Definition 2.3 (Extension and lifting of tensor fields). The extension of tensor fields f :   TnRd+1 from  to U is defined by
f e := f   : U  TnRd+1 .
Analogously, we define the lifting of tensor fields fh : h  TnRd+1 from h to  as the inverse of the extension restricted to h,
fh := fh  |-h1 :   TnRd+1 . To extend a tensor field fh : h  TnRd+1 from h to U, we first lift it to  and then extend, i.e.,
fhe := (fh)e : U  TnRd+1 .
2.2.2 Derivative of tensor fields We introduce derivatives of surface tensor fields, first the Euclidean derivative of extended tensor fields, second the covariant derivative. Those derivative definitions are just collections of standard definitions to introduce notation, see, e.g., [12, 20]. Definition 2.4 (Euclidean derivative). Let the tensor field f :   TnRd+1 be given in the basis notation f = f i1,...,inei1  . . .  ein. We denote by f¯ a smooth extension of f in the neighborhood of the surface  with f¯| = f . The Euclidean derivative of this tensor field is defined by
Df¯ := ej f¯i1,...,in ei1  . . .  ein  ej . The derivative Df¯ is a rank-(n + 1) tensor field on .
The Euclidean derivative of surface tensor fields f depends on the extension f¯ in the embedding space. In order to fix this, we consider the extension introduced before in Definition 2.3. For this an equivalent definition can be formulated in terms of tangential surface derivatives. This can be formulated intrinsically and thus does not need the notation of an extension explicitly.
10

Definition 2.5 (Surface derivative). Let the tensor field f :   TnRd+1 be given in the basis notation f = f i1,...,inei1  . . .  ein and let pj = P ej. The tangential surface derivative of this tensor field is defined by
Df := pj f i1,...,in ei1  . . .  ein  ej .
with pj f = pj · Df¯ a tangential directional derivative, i.e., f = (pj f )ej = P Df¯ is the surface gradient. The derivative Df is a rank-(n + 1) tensor field on  but not necessarily tangential.
Remark 2.5. The surface derivative corresponds to the Euclidean derivative applied to an extended tensor field f e = f   that is extended constant in normal direction, i.e., Df = Df e|. For vector fields V this corresponds to a one-sided projection of the full Euclidean derivative, i.e., DV = DV¯ |P . For scalar fields f it is equivalent to the surface gradient, i.e., Df = f . This derivative operator can be defined intrinsically in terms of derivatives of a local parametrization and metric tensor and is implemented directly by surface finite elements.
Definition 2.6 (Convariant derivative). Let f  T n denote a tangential tensor field on the surface . Denote by f¯ a smooth extension of f as in Definition 2.4 then the covariant derivative is defined by
f := P Df¯| .
Remark 2.6. The definition of the covariant derivative is independent of the choice of the extension, cf. [11, Chapter 3], and can also be written in terms of the tangential surface derivative, i.e., f = P Df . For scalar fields f :   R this corresponds to the classical surface gradient, i.e., f = f = P Df¯|. For vector fields V the covariant derivative can be expressed using the projection matrix P as V = P DV¯ |P . Definition 2.7 (Higher-order derivatives). For a tensor field f and its extension f¯ as above, we introduce the s-order derivatives as
Dsf¯ := D . . . Df¯, Ds f := D . . . Df , and sP f :=  . . . P f ,
by s-times application of the first-order derivatives D, D, and , respectively.
Remark 2.7. The definitions of the covariant derivative on  can directly be applied to define a covariant derivative inside the (smooth) elements K  Kh of the discrete surface h. These local definitions are glued together to formally write the discrete surface derivatives of a discrete tensor field fh : h  TnRd+1 as hPhfh(x) := K Phfh(x) for x  K. The Euclidean derivative is directly defined by the derivative of an extended tensor field f¯h of fh with f¯h|h = fh and the surface derivative is intrinsically defined in the smooth element K, denoted by DK.

2.3 Function spaces and norms

In the following we define function spaces for tensor fields on  and on h for tangential and non-tangential tensor fields. Due to the local definition of (discrete) projections and derivatives, we define all spaces and norms elementwise summed over the elements of the corresponding triangulations. This is denoted by K and Kh in the definitions. Elementwise defined spaces are called broken Sobolev spaces [20, 13].
Definition 2.8 (Lp-spaces). We denote by Lp(K, TnM ), for M either  or Rd+1, the space of functions f :   TnM with finite Lp-norm with elementwise integrals, i.e.,

f

p Lp(K)

:=

f p d

KK K

with f the Frobenius norm induced by the Frobenius inner product ·, · .

The norm is defined elementwise in order to allow the evaluation of fields that are

only defined piecewise, like projected tensors on the discrete surface or derivatives of

only piecewise smooth functions. Analogously, the Lp-space and norm is defined for

functions on the discrete surface h by integrals over the corresponding elements in the

gLr2iW-dineKnwher.illpTurhoseedutshpcetacswehiolalrntbdceuctdoenrnoroetsatpetdioonnbdyin·(g·K, ·n)=oK. rm=.f

is denoted by Lp(Kh, Rd+1).
L2(K) for the L2-norm. The corresponding (·, ·)L2(K). The limiting spaces L(K) and

L(Kh) are defined by the essential supremum over the local tensor Frobenius norm.

We define Sobolev spaces over smooth tensor fields recursively. Therefore, we re-

quire that certain derivatives are in a corresponding Lp-space. Since covariant deriva-

tives are defined for tangential tensor fields only, we introduce two different spaces

with their norms, for tangential and non-tangential tensor fields, respectively. We set

W 0,p(K, TnM ) := Lp(K, TnM ) for both, tangential and non-tangential tensor fields,

with M =  or M = Rd+1, respectively.

Definition 2.9 (Sobolev spaces for tangential tensor fields). The higher-order Sobolev spaces Wtsa,np(K) =. W s,p(K, Tn), for s > 0, of tangential tensor fields is defined as the set of functions f  W s-1,p(K, Tn) with s-order covariant derivative sf  Lp(K, Tn+s). The associated norm · Wtsa,np(K) is defined by

s

f

p Wtsa,np (K)

:=

j f

p Lp(K)

.

Similarly, the Sobolev spaces for tensor fields in the ambient space are defined using the surface derivative D instead of the covariant derivative .

Definition 2.10 (Sobolev spaces for non-tangential tensor fields). The Sobolev space W s,p(K) =. W s,p(K, TnRd+1) of tensor fields in the ambient space is defined as the set of functions f  W s-1,p(K, TnRd+1) with s-order Euclidean derivative Ds f  Lp(K, Tn+sRd+1) and norm defined by

s

f

p W s,p(K)

:=

Dj f

p Lp(K)

For fields on the discrete surface h, tangential tensors are only defined in the interior
of the surface elements K  Kh. So are its (covariant) derivatives. The Sobolev spaces and corresponding norms on h are denoted by W s,p(Kh, M ) and are defined in terms of h and Dh for M = h and M = Rd+1, respectively.
If the tensor fields on  are continuous, we also use the Sobolev spaces W s,p(, M )
defined by integrals over  directly. Since the integration over  can be decomposed into integration over the elements of K, it follows that W s,p(, M )  W s,p(K, M ).
We denote the spaces and norm with p = 2 by Hs =. W s,2.

2.4 Tensor projections
Lemma 2.3 (Estimates for tensor projections). Let P and Ph are tensor projections for rank-n tensor fields on  and h, respectively. Then we have the following estimates for the projections of tensors

P - Ph L(Kh) P - P PhP L(Kh) Ph - PhP Ph L(Kh)

n - nh L(Kh) ,

n - nh

2 L

(Kh

)

,

n - nh

2 L

(Kh

)

.

Proof. The first estimate follows by induction over the tensor rank n, from the local pointwise estimate

P - Ph 2 = n  n - nh  nh 2 = 2(1 - n, nh 2)  2 n - nh 2 .

Let f (n) = f (n-1)  f (1) be a rank-n tensor on h represented as tensor product of a rank-(n - 1) and a rank-1 tensor. Then we have the induction relation

Phf (n) = Phf (n-1)  Phf (1) (P - Ph)f (n) = P f (n) - Phf (n)
= (P - Ph)f (n-1)  P f (1) + Phf (n-1)  (P - Ph)f (1) .

Using triangle inequality and extracting the operator norm of the projection gives by recursion the first result.
The second estimate follows by induction from the equation for vector fields V on h, i.e., (P - P PhP )V = P nh, V P nh and the estimate

1

P nh



1+ 2

n - nh

n - nh .

We can interchange the roles of n and nh to obtain the last estimate.

Lemma 2.4 (Estimates for the derivatives of tensor projections). Let P and Ph are the tensor projections for rank-n tensor fields on  and h, respectively, properly extended to U. Then we have

D(P - Ph) L(Kh) hkg-1 .

13

Proof. For tangential projections P and Ph we can write locally
D(n  n - nh  nh) = [whiknjh + nihwhjk - wiknj - niwjk]ei  ej  ek = [whik(njh - nj) + (nih - ni)whjk + (whik - wik)nj + ni(whjk - wjk)]ei  ej  ek ,
with W = -Dn = wijei  ej and Wh = -Dnh = whijei  ej the continuous and discrete surface Weingarten maps. The estimate then follows from (8) and (9). For tensor projections, the assertion follows by induction over the tensor rank, see the proof of Lemma 2.3.

2.5 Comparison of tensor fields on the discrete and continuous surface

The relation between tensor fields and its extensions and lifts in norms and inner products is given by the following Lemma.
Lemma 2.5 (L2-norm equivalence). Let f , g  L2(K, TnRd+1) be not necessarily tangential tensor fields. Then we have the estimate.

(f , g)K - (f e, ge)Kh hkg+1 f e Kh ge Kh .

For h < h0 small enough this implies L2-norm equivalence, i.e.,

f e Kh

fK

f e Kh .

Proof. The estimate is analogous to the well-known estimate for the lifting of functions [9]. We write

(f , g)K - (f e, ge)Kh = (|det(B)| f e, ge)Kh - (f e, ge)Kh  1 - |det(B)| L(Kh) f e Kh ge Kh .
The estimate follows from properties of B, see Lemma 2.1.

In the following we will often make use of the fact, that while the discrete normal part of a tangential vector field does not vanish, it at least converges to zero with an order that is determined by the geometric approximation order kg. For inner products this order of convergence is even one order better than for norm estimates which is proven as a so-called "non-standard geometry estimate" for vector fields [20].

Lemma 2.6 (Standard and non-standard estimates for mixed projections). For a tensor field f  Lp(K, TnRd+1) we have for all p  [1, ]
QhP f Lp(K) hkg P f Lp(K).
For vector fields V  W 1,1(K, TnRd+1), we have the estimate (V, P nh)K hkg+1 V W 1,1(K) .

14

For tensor fields f , g  H1(K, TnRd+1), we have

(Qhf e, P ge)Kh hkg+1 f H1(K) g H1(K).

(11)

Proof. The first estimate follows from Lemma 2.3 and orthogonality of Qh and Ph. The second estimate is proven by Hansbo et al. [20]. The last estimate follows for vector

fields V and W on  from

(QhV e, P W e)Kh = (P nh, P V e, nh W e)Kh hkg+1 V, nh W W 1,1(K) hkg+1 V H1(K) W H1(K) ,

using the norm equivalence of Lemma 2.5. For tensor fields the estimate follows by induction.

2.6 Comparison of covariant derivatives of tensor fields on the discrete and continuous surface

We now consider gradients of tensor fields. Given a non-tangential tensor field f on  we write out the tangential gradient of the tangential part of f by

P f = P DP f e

(12)

= P Df e - P DQf e

Remark 2.8. Analogously, we introduce the derivative of the tangential part of tensor fields fh on h, locally inside the elements of the triangulation K  Kh, by
K Phfh = PhDfhe - PhDQhfhe = PhDK fh - PhDK Qhfh .

The second form is typically used in surface finite element codes.

Lemma 2.7. For (non-tangential) tensor fields f :   TnRd+1 the following estimate holds for the derivative of the normal part:

P DQf e K W L(K) Qf K .

(13)

Interchanging the roles of Q and P , we estimate analogously

QDP f e K W L(K) P f K .

(14)

Proof. By the product rule, we have for a tensor

P DQf e = (P DQ)Qf e.

As the norm of DQ is bounded, i.e., DQ W , so are the norms of DP , and by induction also the norms of DP and DQ. Thus, the estimate (13) follows. Analogously, we can write
QDP f e = (QDP )P f e.

15

Remark 2.9. We obtain on each element K  Kh with similar arguments as in Lemma 2.7 the estimates for discrete projections

PhDQhfhe K QhDPhfhe K

Wh L(K) Qhfh K , Wh L(K) Phfh K ,

(15) (16)

where Wh = -Dnh denotes the discrete Weingarten map on the elements of h. Remark 2.10. For tangential tensor fields f  Ht1an(K) Lemma 2.7 implies
Df e K = P DP f e K + QDP f e K f K + W L(K) f K f Ht1an(K).
For higher order derivatives a similar estimate holds:

Lemma 2.8. For f  Htman(K) with m  1, the ambient Sobolev norm is bounded by the tangential Sobolev norm:

Dmf e K = Dmf K

f Htman(K) .

Proof. This is shown by Hansbo et al. [20, Lemma 2.3].

The following Lemma gives estimates for the error in derivatives of extended and projected tensor fields.

Lemma 2.9 (H1-estimates). Let f  H1(K, TnRd+1) be a non-tangential tensor field. Then we have

(P f )e - h Phf e Kh hkg Df e Kh + Phf e Kh + h-1 Qhf e Kh .

(17)

Proof. We write almost everywhere

(P f )e - h Phf e = P Df e - PhDf e + PhDQhf e - P DQf e .

Thus, we can estimate

(P f )e - h Phf e Kh hkg Df e Kh + PhDQhf e - P DQf e Kh .

As in the proof of Lemma 2.7 we write almost everywhere on h

PhDQhf e - P DQf e = (PhDQh)Qhf e - (P DQ)Qf e = (Ph(DQh - DQ))Qhf e + (PhDQ)(Qh - Q)f e + ((Ph - P )DQ)Qf e.

As DQh - DQ hkg-1, see Lemma 2.4, we obtain

PhDQhf e - P DQf e Kh

hkg-1 Qhf e Kh + hkg f e Kh hkg h-1 Qhf e Kh + Phf e Kh .

16

Remark 2.11. In analogy to the estimate in Lemma 2.9, we obtain

(P f )e - h Phf e Kh hkg Df e K + P f K + h-1 Qf K . with norms on . Thus, we immediately see that for tangential tensor fields f  Ht1an(K)
(P f )e - h Phf e Kh hkg f Ht1an(K). We introduce a new mixed norm motivated by the structure of the right hand side of (17).

Definition 2.11. For fh  H1(Kh, TnRd+1) we define the norm

|||fh||| := h Phfh Kh + Dfhe Kh + Phfh Kh + h-1 Qhfh Kh .

Remark 2.12. From Lemma 2.9 it follows that for f  H1(K, TnRd+1)

P f K |||f e||| .

(18)

For tangential tensor fields f  Ht1an(K) we have

|||f e|||

f Ht1an(K).

(19)

3 Finite-element discretization of tensor equation
In order to describe approximations of the function space Ht1an(K), we introduce discrete finite element spaces in the following. A family of finite element spaces on h is based on lifting functions in V^hm from ^h to the parametrized surface h, i.e.,
Vhm =. Vhm(h, R) := v~  C0(h) | v~ = v^  h-1, for some v^  V^hm .
Similarly to the space Vhm(^h, RN ) for vector-valued maps on ^h, we introduce the finite element space for tensor-valued functions on h as product space over Vhm by
Vhm =. Vhm(h, TnRd+1) := [Vhm](d+1)n .
Since each component is continuous and locally differentiable, we have
Vhm  H1(h, TnRd+1)  C0(h, TnRd+1) .
We introduce a tensor interpolation operators Ih and I as the usual Lagrange interpolation for continuos tensor fields, by using a componentwise scalar Lagrange interpolation operator. For a continuous scalar field on ^h, we have the classical Lagrange interpolation I^hm : C0(^h)  V^hm, see, e.g., [12]. This induces a lifted scalar interpolation Ihm : C0(h)  Vhm for scalar fields v~  C0(h) by
(Ihmv~)(h(x)) = (I^hmv~  h)(x) for x  ^h .

17

A componentwise scalar interpolation operators defines the tensor Lagrange interpolation I^hm and Ihm. We write the corresponding interpolation operator for tensor fields v  C0(, TnRd+1) on the continuous surface  by
(Imv)e := Ihmve , and (I^mv)e := I^hmve ,
respectively. A discrete formulation of the continuous variational problem (2) can be obtained by
approximating the surface  by h, the function space Ht1an(K) by Vh, and by projecting tensor fields in the ambient space to the tangent space. The tangentiality of the solution can be obtained by introducing an additional penalization term sh into the bilinear form.
The resulting discrete variational problem reads: Find uh  Vh, such that,

Ah(uh, vh) = lh(vh), vh  Vh ,

(20)

with discrete forms given by

Ah(uh, vh) := ah(uh, vh) + sh(uh, vh) , ah(uh, vh) := (h Phuh, h Phvh)Kh + (Phuh, Phvh)Kh , sh(uh, vh) := h-2 Qh,kp uh, Qh,kp vh Kh ,
lh(vh) := (f e, Phvh)Kh ,
where   [0, 1] and  > 0 are penalization parameters. The normal projection operator Qh,kp is defined over a normal vector nh,kp that fulfills a (possibly) higher-order approximation of the exact surface normal n, i.e.,

n - nh,kp L(Kh)  C hkp

(21)

with kp  kg a penalty-term integer order.

Remark 3.1. The normal nh,kp could be either an interpolation of the exact surface normal, i.e., nh,kp = Ihk,pk-g1n, or be given as the normal of a discrete surface h,kp approximating  with higher order, extended to U. We will also analyze the case kp = kg
that is especially relevant if you just have a discrete surface given and thus are forced to
use nh,kp = nh.

4 Error analysis
In this section we prove different types of error estimates culminating in Section 4.3 in the discretization error estimates described in Section 1.2. Following the classical procedure we begin with interpolation-errors estimates in Section 4.1. The following up Section 4.2 discusses differences in discrete and continuous bilinear and linear forms that emerge from the geometry approximation. These are prerequisites for the proofs in Section 4.3. The estimates in this final subsection are formulated in various norms. Among these are the energy norms of the associated problems that are defined as follows.

18

For a bilinear form , we define an associated energy-norm |||·||| by |||v|||2 := (v, v). The discrete energy norm |||·|||Ah can thereby be split into parts:

|||vh|||2Ah :=Ah(vh, vh) = ah(vh, vh) + sh(vh, vh)

=

h Phvh

2 Kh

+

Phvh

2 Kh

+

h-2

Qh,kp vh

2 Kh

|||vh|||2ah

|||vh|||2sh

and the continuos energy norm is written for v  H1(K) using projection operators:

|||v|||2a := a(v, v) :=

P v

2 K

+

Pv

2 K

.

For v  Ht1an(K) this corresponds to the tangential H1-norm.

4.1 Interpolation errors

Interpolation-error estimates can be deduced from componentwise estimates for the scalar interpolation operator, cf. [9].

Lemma 4.1. For non-tangential tensor fields f  Hm+1(K)  C0() with m  1 we have the following interpolation error estimates for Imf = (Ihmf e) the tensor Lagrange interpolation,

f - Imf K P (f - Imf ) H1(K)

hm+1 f Hm+1(K) , hm f Hm+1(K) ,

(22) (23)

Proof. The first statement follows from standard scalar interpolation error estimates, applied componentwise, cf. [9, Prop. 2.7].
The second statement can be brought into a compatible form:

P (f - Imf ) H1(K)  P (f - Imf ) K + DP (f - Imf ) K f - Imf K + D(f - Imf )e K + DQ(f - Imf )e K hm+1 f Hm+1(K) + hm f Hm+1(K) + W L(K) Q(f - Imf ) K hm+1 + hm f Hm+1(K)

using (22), an argument following Lemma 2.7 to extract the Weingarten map, boundedness of the Weingarten map, and componentwise scalar estimates.

Lemma 4.2. For tangential tensor fields f  Htman+1(K)  C0() with m  1 we have the following interpolation error estimates for Imf = (Ihmf e) the tensor Lagrange interpolation,

f - Imf K
P (f - Imf ) Ht1an(K) |||f e - Ihmf e|||Ah |||f e - Ihmf e|||

hm+1 f , Htman+1(K) hm f , Htman+1(K) hm f , Htman+1(K) hm f . Htman+1(K)

(24) (25) (26) (27)

19

Proof. The first statement follows from (22) using Lemma 2.8 to obtain the estimate w.r.t. the tangential Sobolev norm.
The second statement can be brought into a compatible form similar to the proof of (23)

P (f - Imf ) Ht1an(K)  P (f - Imf ) K + P (f - Imf ) K f - Imf K + P D(f - Imf )e K + P DQ(f - Imf )e K

hm+1 f + Htman+1(K) D(f - Imf )e K + hm+1 + hm f Htman+1(K)

W L(K) Q(f - Imf ) K

using (24). For the third estimate we use L2-norm equivalence, the discrete PhDQh estimate (15),
and similar arguments as before, to obtain

|||f e - Ihmf e|||Ah h Ph(f - Imf )e Kh + Ph(f - Imf )e Kh + h- Qh,kp (f - Imf )e Kh PhD(f - Imf )e Kh + Qh(f - Imf )e Kh + (f - Imf )e Kh + h- (f - Imf )e Kh hm + hm+1 + hm+1- f . Htman+1(K)
With 0    1 the assertion follows. The last estimate for the norm |||·||| , introduced in Definition 2.11, follows the argu-
mentation as before for the norm |||·|||Ah, with  = 1 and Qh,kp replaced by Qh. The additional derivative term is already contained in the estimate of the other terms.

Lemma 4.3 (Continuity of interpolation). For f  Hm+1(K)  C0() the interpolation operator Ihm is continuous w.r.t. the Hl-norm for all 0  l  m + 1,

Ihmf e Hl(Kh)

f e Hl(Kh) .

Proof. The assertion follows directly from the continuity of the componentwise scalar interpolation operator and the boundedness of the piecewise polynomial surface parametrization and its inverse, see Lemma 2.2.

Lemma 4.4 (Inverse estimates). Let vh  Vhku and 0  l  m  ku + 1 then

vhe Hm(K) h-(m-l) vhe Hl(K).

Proof. Similar to the proof of continuity of the interpolation operator, the assertion follows directly from the inverse estimates of the componentwise scalar interpolation operator and the boundedness of the piecewise polynomial surface parametrization and its inverse, see Lemma 2.2.

20

Lemma 4.5. Let vh  Vhku then D(Ph - P )vh Kh

hkg-1 vh Kh .

Proof. This follows from Lemma 2.4 and Lemma 4.4.

Lemma 4.6. (Super-approximation) Let v  Htman(K)  C0(). Then for ku  m

QI ku v K hm+1 v Htman(K),

(28)

where the constant depends on up to ku + 1 order derivatives of Q. For vh  Vhku, l = 0, 1 and s  ku we have

Dl(P vhe - Iku P vhe ) K hs+1-l vhe Hs(K),

(29)

where the constant depends on up to ku + 1 order derivatives of P . The same estimate holds for Q instead of P .

Proof. As QIkuv is continuous, interpolation is well-defined, and we have

Iku QIku v = 0

as the function vanishes at every Lagrange node. QIkuv is not globally smooth, but on every element K  K we can estimate

QIku v K = QIku v - Iku QIku v K hku+1 Q(I ku v)e Hku+1(K) hku+1 Q Cku+1 (I ku v)e Hku+1(K).

As derivatives of order ku + 1 of (Ikuv)e vanish we can use inverse estimates to obtain

QIhku v K

hku+1 (Ihku v)e Hku (K) hm+1 (Ihku v)e Hm(K).

As the interpolation operator is continuous, summation over the elements and Lemma 2.8 yield the first estimate.
The second estimate follows from a similar argument. We have by interpolation, vanishing of the highest order derivatives, and inverse estimates on each element

Dl(P vhe - Iku P vhe ) K

hku+1-l P vhe Hku+1(K) hku+1-l P Cku+1 vhe Hku+1(K) hku+1-l vhe Hku (K) h1-l+s vhe Hs(K).

21

The super-approximation results can be used to prove inverse estimates for discrete projections Phvh and Qhvh of discrete tensor fields vh  Vh. Lemma 4.7. For vh  Vhku, s  l = 0, 1, we have
DlPhvhe Kh h-l+s Phvhe Hs(K) + h-l+1 vh Kh .
The same holds for Qh instead of Ph. Proof. We write

DlPhvhe Kh  Dl(Ph - P )vhe Kh + Dl P vhe - Ihku P vhe Kh + DlIhku P vhe Kh .

The first term can be estimated by Lemma 2.3 for l = 0 or Lemma 4.5 for l = 1 Dl(Ph - P )vhe Kh hkg-l vh Kh  h-l+1 vh Kh .
For the second term we use the super-approximation result (29) and inverse estimates to obtain
Dl P vhe - Ihku P vhe Kh h-l+1 vh Kh .

For the last term, we use inverse estimates and the continuity of the interpolation

DlIhku P vhe Kh

h-(l-s) Ihku P vh Hs(Kh) h-(l-s) P vh Hs(Kh) .

By Lemma 4.5 we get the assertion

P vh Hs(Kh)

Phvh Hs(Kh) + (Ph - P )vh Hs(Kh) Phvh Hs(Kh) + hkg-s vh Kh .

The following lemma allows us to estimate the norm |||·||| introduced in Definition 2.11 of discrete tensor fields in terms of the discrete energy norm.

Lemma 4.8. For vh  L2(h), h  (0, h0] with h0 small enough, we have

Qhvh Kh hkp Phvh Kh + h|||vh|||sh .

(30)

If vh  Vh, then

|||vh||| |||vh|||ah + h-1 Qhvh Kh  |||vh|||ah + h-1+|||vh|||sh .

(31)

22

Proof. For the first estimate, we introduce the normal projection Qh,kp and get

Qhvh Kh   

Qh,kp vh Kh + Qhvh - Qh,kp vh Kh Qh,kp vh Kh + hkp vh Kh Qh,kp vh Kh + hkp Phvh Kh + hkp Qhvh Kh .

Thus, for h  h0 small enough Qhvh Kh hkp Phvh Kh + Qh,kp vh Kh .

For the second estimate, we consider only discrete maps vh  Vh. We note that it is enough to estimate Dvhe Kh. This can be done by first splitting vh into tangential and normal parts

Dvhe Kh  DPhvhe Kh + DQhvhe Kh .

Using (16) we then obtain for the first term

DPhvhe Kh = h Phvhe Kh + QhDPhvhe Kh  h Phvh Kh + C Phvh Kh |||vh|||ah .
For the second term, we use Lemma 4.7 with l = 1, s = 0, and Qh instead of Ph DQhvhe Kh h-1 Qhvh Kh + vh Kh .

Thus, we have

Dvhe Kh |||vh|||ah + vh Kh + h-1 Qhvh Kh . Choosing h small enough yields estimate (31).

Remark 4.1. Using Lemma 4.8, we can reformulate the super-approximation result 29 for s = 1 slightly:

P vhe - Iku P vhe H1(K) h vhe H1(K) h|||vh||| h|||vh|||ah + Qhvh Kh .

(32)

4.2 Geometric errors

There are two geometric error terms, namely the error in the quadratic form and the error in the linear form. The error in the quadratic form again splits into two parts, an H1-part and an L2-part. For non-tangential tensor fields v, w  H1(K) we introduce the forms
(v, w) = (P v, P w)K - (h Phve, h Phwe)Kh m(v, w) = (P v, P w)K - (Phve, Phwe)Kh
l(v) = (f , v)K - (f e, Phve)Kh .
Furthermore, we set

(v)(w) = l(w) - m(v, w) - (v, w).

(33)

23

Lemma 4.9 (The Linear Form). For vh  L2(Kh, TnRd+1), we have
l(vh) hkg+1 f K Phvh Kh + h-1 Qhvh Kh .
Proof. As f = P f , we have for all vh  L2(Kh, TnRd+1)
l(vh) = f , vh K - (f e, Phvh)Kh  P f , Qhvh K + f , Phvh K - (f e, Phvh)Kh hkg Qhvh Kh f K + hkg+1 Phvh Kh f K ,
which follows from Lemma 2.5 and Lemma 2.6. Lemma 4.10 (The mass matrix term). For vh, wh  L2(Kh, TnRd+1) (non-tangential) the following estimate holds for h < h0 small enough:

m(vh, wh)

hkg +1

Phwh Kh + h-1 Qhwh Kh

Phvh Kh + h-1 Qhvh Kh . (34)

For v  L2(K, Tn) (tangential) and wh  L2(Kh, TnRd+1) (non-tangential) the following estimate holds for h < h0 small enough:

m(v, wh) hkg+1 Phwh Kh + h-1 Qhwh Kh v K.

(35)

For v, w  L2(K, Tn) (tangential) the following estimate holds for h < h0 small

enough:

|m(v, w)| hkg+1 w K v K.

(36)

Proof. We write for For vh, wh  L2(Kh, TnRd+1)

m(vh, wh)  P vh, P wh K - (P vh, P wh)Kh + ((P - Ph)vh, (P - Ph)wh)Kh + (Phvh, (P - Ph)wh)Kh + ((P - Ph)vh, Phwh)Kh .
We use Lemma 2.5 to estimate the first term on the right hand side by

P vh, P wh K - (P vh, P wh)Kh hkg+1 P vh Kh P wh Kh
hkg+1 Phvh Kh + hkg Qhvh Kh

Phwh Kh + hkg Qhwh Kh .

24

The second term gives

((P - Ph)vh, (P - Ph)wh)Kh h2kg vh Kh wh Kh h2kg ( Phvh Kh + Qhvh

Kh ) ( Phwh

Kh +

Qhwh

Kh ) .

For the third term we write

(Phvh, (P - Ph)wh)Kh
 (Phvh, Ph(P - Ph)Phwh)Kh + (Phvh, Ph(P - Ph)Qhwh)Kh h2kg Phvh Kh wh Kh + hkg Phvh Kh Qhwh Kh hkg+1 Phvh Kh Phwh Kh + h-1 Qhvh Kh .

The fourth term can be estimated analogously with vh and wh interchanged. Combining everything yields (34).
The estimates (35) and (36) follow from (34) as for v  L2(K, Tn) we have by L2-norm equivalence

Phve Kh + h-1 Qhve Kh

Phv K + h-1 Qhv K v K + hkg-1 v K.

Lemma 4.11 (The derivative term). For vh, wh  H1(Kh, TnRd+1) we have

(vh, wh) hkg |||wh||| |||vh||| .

(37)

If v  Ht1an(K) and wh  Vh and h < h0 small enough, then we obtain

(v, wh) hkg |||wh|||ah + h-1 Qhwh Kh v Ht1an(K).

(38)

For v, w  Ht2an(K) we have

|(v, w)| hkg+1 v Ht2an(K) w Ht2an(K).

(39)

Proof. We begin proving (37) by estimating

(vh, wh) 

P vh, P wh

-
K

(P vh)e, (P wh)e Kh

+ (P vh)e - h Phvh, (P wh)e Kh

+ h Phvh, (P wh)e - h Phwh Kh .

(40)

25

We use Lemma 2.5 to estimate the first term on the right hand side by

P vh, P wh

-
K

(P vh)e, (P wh)e Kh

hkg+1 (P vh)e Kh (P wh)e Kh

hkg+1 P vh K P wh K

hkg+1|||vh||| |||wh||| ,

where (18) was used for the last estimate. For the second term we use Lemma 2.9 and (18) to obtain

(P vh)e - h Phvh, (P wh)e Kh  (P vh)e - h Phvh Kh (P wh)e Kh hkg |||vh||| (P wh)e Kh hkg |||vh||| |||wh||| .
The third term can be estimated analogously. Estimate (38) follows by (37) using (19) and (31). To obtain estimate (39) we split 
as before in (40) and also estimate the first term in the same manner. Instead of using Lemma 2.9 for the second term we split this part as in the proof of Lemma 2.9 into

((v)e - h Phve, (w)e)Kh  ((P - Ph)Dve, (w)e)Kh + (PhDQhve, (w)e)Kh .
For the first term we estimate using (11) and Lemma 2.8

((P - Ph)Dve, (w)e)Kh

= (QhDve, (w)e)Kh hkg+1 Dve H1(K) (w)e H1(K) hkg+1 v Ht1an(K) w Ht2an(K).

The second term can be estimated using (15). Thus we obtain

((v)e - h Phve, (w)e)Kh

hkg+1 v Ht1an(K) w Ht2an(K)

as estimate for the second term in (40). For the third term in (40) we write

(h Phve, (w)e - h Phwe)Kh  ((v)e, (w)e - h Phwe)Kh + (h Phve - (v)e, (w)e - h Phwe)Kh .

26

The first term corresponds to the second term in (40) with v and w interchanged and can be dealt with accordingly. The last term can be estimated using Lemma 2.9 and (19) by

(h Phve - (v)e, (w)e - h Phwe)Kh

h2kg v Ht1an(K) w Ht1an(K).

Combining everything, we indeed obtain estimate (39).

4.3 Discretization errors
We will now prove the main results of this paper as described in Section 1.2. To this end we proceed as in the standard theory for Galerkin methods and analogously to the theory of scalar surface finite elements [9]. This means we first introduce a perturbed Galerkin orthogonality for the discrete energy that is then used to prove the error estimates in the energy norm. We then improve these estimates for the tangential part of the error essentially by repeating the argument for the continuous energy and making use of the already shown discrete estimate. For the L2-norm estimates we employ an Aubin­Nitsche type argument based on the dual problem.

4.3.1 Perturbed Galerkin orthogonality

In the standard theory of numerics for partial differential equations, an important tool is the Galerkin orthogonality, i.e., the property that the error between the continuous and the discrete solution is orthogonal on the discrete test space. In our setting this is no longer the case, but the error that is made with respect to true orthogonality can be quantified.
Lemma 4.12. Let u  Ht1an(K) be the solution to the continuous problem, uh  Vh the solution to the discrete problem and vh  Vh a test tensor field. Then

a(u - uh, vh) = (uh)(vh) + sh(uh, vh)

(41)

Ah(ue - uh, vh) = (u)(vh) + sh(ue, vh).

(42)

Proof. This follows directly by inserting the test tensor field into both the discrete and the continuous problems and subtracting and rearranging the terms. Note that this actually motivated the definition of  in (33).

In order to quantify this deviation from true orthogonality, we will need the following estimates
Lemma 4.13. For u  Ht1an(K) and vh  Vh, we have for h < h0 small enough

(u)(vh) |sh(ue, vh)|

hkg |||vh|||ah + h-1 Qhvh Kh

u Ht1an(K) + f K

hkg-1+|||vh|||Ah u Ht1an(K) + f K , hkp-|||vh|||sh u K .

27

Proof. By Lemma 4.9, Lemma 4.10 (35), and Lemma 4.11 (38), we have

(u)(vh)  l(vh) + m(u, vh) + (u, vh)

hkg+1 |||vh|||ah + h-1 Qhvh Kh hkg |||vh|||ah + h-1 Qhvh Kh

f K + u K + h-1 u Ht1an(K) u Ht1an(K) + f K .

Furthermore, we have by (30)

|||vh|||ah + h-1 Qhvh Kh The second estimate follows from

h-1+|||vh|||Ah .

|sh(ue, vh)| = h-2 Qh,kp ue, Qh,kp vh Kh  h-2 Qh,kp ue Kh Qh,kp vh Kh hkp- ue Kh |||vh|||sh
and the L2-norm equivalence.

This will be enough to prove the error estimates in the discrete energy norm. In order to improve our estimates later, we will also employ the following result:
Lemma 4.14. Let u, v  Ht1an() and uh, uh  Vh discrete approximations of u, v. Then

(uh)(vh)

hkg v Ht1an(K) + |||ve - vh|||

If u, v  Ht2an() then

f K + u Ht1an(K) + |||ue - uh||| .

(uh)(vh) hkg+1 v Ht2an(K) + h-1|||ve -vh|||
Proof. We write again

f K + u Ht2an(K) + h-1|||ue -uh||| .

(uh)(vh)  l(vh) + m(uh, vh) + (uh, vh) . The first two terms are estimated using Lemma 4.9 and Lemma 4.10 (34) by

l(vh) + m(uh, vh) hkg+1 Phvh Kh + h-1 Qhvh Kh

f K + Phuh Kh + h-1 Qhuh Kh .

We then estimate using (19)

Phvh Kh + h-1 Qhvh Kh  |||vh|||  |||ve||| + |||ve - vh||| v Ht1an(K) + |||ve - vh||| .

28

For the last term we get

(uh, vh)  (uh - u, vh - v)

+ (u, vh - v) + (uh - u, v) + |(u, v)|

Estimating the first part using (37) and the second and third parts using (38) gives

(uh - u, vh - v) hkg |||uh - ue||| |||vh - ve|||

(u, vh - v) (uh - u, v)

hkg |||vh - ve||| u Ht1an(K) hkg |||uh - ue||| v Ht1an(K).

For the last term we use either (38) or (39) depending on the smoothness of u and v and thus obtain either

|(u, v)| |(u, v)|

hkg u Ht1an(K) v Ht1an(K), or hkg+1 u Ht2an(K) v Ht2an(K) .

Combing these estimates yields the assertions.

4.3.2 Estimates in the energy norm

We employ the discrete perturbed Galerkin orthogonality Lemma 4.13 to prove the
following estimate for the error e := ue - uh in the energy norm. We split the error e in two parts, the interpolation error eI := ue - Ihue with Ih = Ihku and a discrete remainder eh := Ihue - uh.

Theorem 4.1. For the discrete solution uh  Vhku and the continuous solution u  Htkaun+1(K), we have for h < h0 small enough the estimates

|||ue - Ihue|||Ah

hku u , Htkaun+1(K)

|||Ihue - uh|||Ah

hm f K + u Htkaun+1(K) ,

with m := min{ku, kg - 1 + , kp - } and hence

|||ue - uh|||Ah

hm f K + u Htkaun+1(K) .

Proof. The first estimate follows directly by interpolation error estimates (4.2). For the discrete remainder eh = Ihue - uh, we can use (42) and Lemma 4.13 to obtain

|||eh|||2Ah = Ah(Ihue - uh, eh) = Ah(Ihue - ue, eh) + (u)(eh) + sh(ue, eh)

 |||eI |||Ah|||eh|||Ah + (u)(eh) + |sh(ue, eh)|

(hku + hkg-1+ + hkp-) Division by |||eh|||Ah yields the assertion.

f K + u Htkaun+1(K) |||eh|||Ah .

29

4.3.3 Improved estimate in tangential norms
We obtain estimates for the tangential part of e by proceeding analogously to the proof of Theorem 4.1 for the continuous energy norm |||·|||a. In order to really obtain an improvement relative to the discrete energy norm estimate, we employ the super-approximation result Lemma 4.6 to obtain an estimate on the normal part of the interpolation of the test vector P e that translates into a better estimate for the penalty term in particular.

Theorem 4.2. We have for h < h0 small enough

P (u - uh) Ht1an(K) hm^ f K + u Htkaun+1(K)

(43)

with m^ = min{ku, kg, kp + kg - 2, kg - 1 + 2}.
Proof. First, we note that the tangential H1-norm corresponds to the continuous energy norm, i.e., P (u - uh) Ht1an(K) = |||e |||a. Furthermore, interpolation of the projected error IhP e = IhkuP e  Vhku is well-defined and can also be written as IhP e = Ihue - IhP uh. We will use this as a test tensor field to obtain the estimate in the continuous energy norm. The perturbed Galerkin orthogonality (41) for the continuous bilinear form allows us to write
|||e |||2a = a(e , e - (IhP e) ) + (uh)(IhP e) + sh(uh, IhP e)
 |||e |||a|||e - (IhP e) |||a + (uh)(IhP e) + |sh(uh, IhP e)| .

We begin by estimating |||e - (IhP e) |||a. As in Section 4.3.3 we split the error into e = eI + eh. Then
|||e - (IhP e) |||a  |||eI - (IhP eI ) |||a + |||eh - (IhP eh) |||a.
By continuity of the interpolation operator and Lemma 4.2 we have

|||eI - (IhP eI ) |||a = P eI - P (IhP eI )
P eI Ht1an(K) hku u . Htkaun+1(K)

Ht1an (K)

Furthermore, we can use (32) for the discrete remainder eh

|||eh - (IhP eh) |||a = P eh - P (IhP eh) Ht1an(K) P eeh - (IhP eh)e H1(K)
h|||eh|||ah + Qheh Kh .
We then estimate using Lemma 2.9, L2-norm equivalence and (31)

|||eh|||ah

|||eh|||a + hkg |||eh||| |||eh|||a + hkg-1 Qheh Kh + hkg |||eh|||ah .

30

For h small enough, we can absorb the last term into the left hand side. Thus, we have

|||eh - (IhP eh) |||a

h|||eh|||a + Qheh Kh h|||e |||a + h|||eh|||Ah + hku+1 u Htkaun+1(K) h|||e |||a + hm+ f K + u Htkaun+1(K) .

So far we have shown that

|||e |||2a  |||e |||a|||e - (IhP e) |||a + (uh)(IhP e) + |sh(uh, IhP e)|

h|||e |||2a + (hm+ + hku ) f K + u Htkaun+1(K) |||e |||a

+ (uh)(IhP e) + |sh(uh, IhP e)| .

For h small enough, we can absorb the first term into the left hand side. To estimate  we interpret IhP e as an approximation of the 0 tensor field and use
Lemma 4.14 to estimate

(uh)(IhP e) hkg |||IhP e||| f K + u Ht1an(K) + |||ue - uh||| .

We estimate using Lemma 4.2, (31), and Theorem 4.1

|||ue - uh|||

 |||ue - Ihue||| + |||Ihue - uh||| hku u Htkaun+1(K) + h-1+|||Ihue - uh|||Ah hm-1+ f K + u Htkaun+1(K) .

Thus, we obtain

(44)

(uh)(IhP e) (hkg + hm+kg-1+)|||IhP e||| f K + u Htkaun+1(K) . We then estimate using (31), continuity of the interpolation operator, and Remark 2.11

|||IhP e|||

|||IhP e|||ah + h-1 QhIhP e Kh |||e |||a + h-1 QhIhP e Kh .

For the penalty term |sh| we find

|sh(uh, IhP e)|

h-2 Qh,kp uh Kh Qh,kp IhP e Kh h- |||e|||Ah + hkp- u K Qh,kp IhP e Kh

hm- f K + u Htkaun+1(K) Qh,kp IhP e Kh

with

Qh,kp IhP e Kh

QhIhP e Kh + hkg P e Kh QhIhP e Kh + hkg |||e |||a.

31

We now consider QhIhP e Kh. We use Lemma 4.6, continuity of the interpolation operator, and L2-norm equivalence to estimate

QhIhP e Kh

QIhP e Kh + hkg IhP e Kh (h2 + hkg )|||e |||a.

Thus we have shown

(uh)(IhP e) |sh(uh, IhP e)|

(hkg + hm+kg-1+) f K + u Htkaun+1(K) |||e |||a, and (hm-+2 + hm-+kg ) f K + u Htkaun+1(K) |||e |||a.

This results in the estimate

|||e |||a (hku + hkg + hm+ + hm-+kg ) f K + u Htkaun+1(K) . In combination with the definition of m this simplifies to

|||e |||a (hku + hkg + hkg-1+2 + hkp+kg-2) f K + u Htkaun+1(K) .

4.3.4 Estimate in the L2-norm
We consider the L2-norm estimates separately for the tangential part P e and the normal part Qe of the error. For the tangential part we can employ an Aubin-Nitsche type argument in order to show an improvement from the estimate in the energy norm. Whether there is an improvement in the normal part as well depends on the choice of the penalty parameter .
In order to use the Aubin-Nitsche trick, we introduce the dual problem: Find   Ht1an(), s.t.

a(v, ) = v, P e ,


v  Ht1an().

(45)

Lemma 4.15. Assume that   C2. For a solution   Ht2an() of (45), we have the H2-regularity property

 Ht2an()

Pe .

Proof. Similar to the argumentation by Dziuk and Elliott [12], the regularity result follows from the theory of elliptic systems of linear PDEs on Cartesian domains   Rd using local coordinates, see, e.g., [44, Theorem 6.29].

32

Theorem 4.3. For the discrete solution uh  Vhku and the continuous solution u  Htkaun+1(K), we have for h < h0 small enough and kp > 
Q(u - uh) K h|||ue - uh|||Ah hm+ f K + u Htkaun+1(K) ,
P (u - uh) K h P (u - uh) Ht1an(K) + hm~ f K + u Htkaun+1(K) hmin{m^ +1,m~ } f K + u Htkaun+1(K) ,
with m~ := min{kg + 1, 2m, m + 3 - }, m as in Theorem 4.1, and m^ as in Theorem 4.2. Proof. We have by L2-norm equivalence

Q(u - uh) K Qh,kp (ue - uh) Kh + (Q - Qh,kp )(ue - uh) Kh h|||ue - uh|||sh + hkp ue - uh Kh h|||ue - uh|||sh + hkp Ph(ue - uh) Kh + hkp Qh(ue - uh) Kh h(1 + hkp )|||ue - uh|||sh + (hkp + h2kp ) Ph(ue - uh) Kh .
where the last estimate follows from (30). In order to prove the estimate for the tangential part, we define h := Ihme  Vhku
with m = min{ku, 2} for the solution   Ht2an(K) of the dual problem (45). Note that we have

|||e - h||| h  Ht2an(K) h P e K by interpolation error estimates Lemma 4.2 and the H2 regularity of the dual problem Lemma 4.15. Furthermore, we have

Qh,kp h Kh

Qh Kh + hkp h Kh hmin{ku+1,3}  Ht2an(K) + hkp h Kh hmin{ku+1,3,kp} P e K ,

where we used the super-approximation Lemma 4.6 for ku  2 and Lemma 4.2 for ku = 1. Insertion of P e as a test function into the dual problem allows us to estimate using (41)

Pe

2 K

=

a(e

, )

= a(e ,  - h) + (uh)(h) + sh(uh, h)

 P e Ht1an(K)  - h Ht1an(K) + (uh)(h) + |sh(uh, h)| . Using Lemma 4.14, we then get

(uh)(h)

hkg+1  Ht2an(K) + h-1|||e -h|||

f K + u Ht2an(K) + h-1|||ue -uh|||

hkg+1 P e K f K + u Ht2an(K) + h-1|||ue -uh||| .

33

We obtain, using (44)

(uh)(h)

hkg+1 + h2m P e K f K + u Htkaun+1(K) .

For the |sh| term we estimate

|sh(uh, h)|

h-2 Qh,kp uh Kh Qh,kp h Kh

h-+min{ku+1,3,kp} |||e|||Ah + hkp- u K P e K

hm+3- + h2m

f K + u Htkaun+1(K) P e K .

In summary we finally obtain the assertion

P e K h P e Ht1an(K) + hkg+1 + h2m + hm+3-

f K + u Htkaun+1(K) .

5 Numerical Experiments

We consider an ellipse curve and an ellipsoidal surface embedded in R2 and R3, respectively, given by the implicit descriptions

1d =

x = (x1, x2)T  R2 | 1d(x) :=

and

c = 1.

This levelset description

allows

to

compute the normal

vector n(x) = D(x)/ D(x) and the Weingarten map W(x) = -P (x)Dn(x)P (x)

analytically. We also run tests on the unit sphere S2. To construct a discrete surface approximation h, we start with a reference grid ^h
obtained from an explicit ellipse, ellipsoid, or sphere grid, constructed using Gmsh [17].

The higher-order polynomial surface approximation is then built by an iteratively com-

puted surface projection (x) using the simple iterative scheme proposed by Demlow and

Dziuk [10] for the ellipse and ellipsoid and the direct coordinate projection (x) = x/ x

for the sphere. The grid representation is then implemented using Dune-CurvedGrid

[37].

In order to compute errors, we prescribe an exact solution of (2) and then compute

the right-hand side function f analytically using Sympy [31]. We denote the tensor rank

n as superscript (n) in the following. The numerical experiments on the surfaces are

performed for 1-tensor fields (vector fields) and 2-tensor fields, only.

We prescribe a solution vector field u(11d)  T 11d and u(21d)  T 12d as

u(11d)(x) = P (x31x2, (x1 + 2)x22)T , u(21d)(x) = curln(x1x2x3),

for x = (x1, x2)  1d , for x = (x1, x2, x3)  2d ,

34

with curln f = f n ×  the normal-curl of a scalar field f . The right-hand side function f (1) is then explicitly computed, as f (1) = u(1) + u(1). In Fig. 1 the corresponding
surface geometry and vector field solution is visualized.

Figure 1: Left: initial grid of the ellipsoid surface 2d. Right: solution u(21d) of the problem for kg = 2.

A 2-tensor field solution u(2)  T 2 is prescribed as a projected constant tensor:

u(12d)(x) = P

-1 1

3 2

,

-1 3 0 u(22d)(x) = P  1 2 0 ,
0 01

for x = (x1, x2)  1d , for x = (x1, x2, x3)  S2 .

A corresponding right-hand side function f (2) is computed in analogy to f (1).

5.1 Results for vector-fields on 2d
Table 1 shows the experimental order of convergence for vector-field solutions of (20) on 2d. The surface is approximated by discrete surfaces of geometry order kg  {1, 2, 3, 4} with penalty term order kp  {kg, kg + 1}. We have analyzed the cases   0.5.
Since the error norms are composed of many terms that might be weighted by the penalty pre-factor , we expect that with  small or large either the one or the other term in the error estimates dominates the results for h > h0, i.e., if the grid size is not yet small enough. Asymptotically, the constants in the analysis are irrelevant, but numerically we can only handle moderate grid sizes. This observation leads to the result that depending on  we might see different convergence orders. This is partially already mentioned and observed by Hansbo et al. [20]. In order to compute the experimental order of convergence, we take the minimal order for computations with   {10, 104}.
First of all, we observe from the data that there is a difference in the energy norm |||·|||Ah and the tangential H1-norm. Only for the case kp = kg + 1 and  = 1 these convergence orders are the same.
Second, we observe that the tangential L2-norm errors show higher order convergence than the full L2-norm errors in some cases. For the isogeometric case, i.e., kg = kp,

Table 1: Asymptotic experimental order of convergence on 2d for various geometry orders kg and some variation of the penalty term order kp and pre-factor exponent . Additionally, the expected orders are shown in terms of the order exponents m, m~ , and m^ .

the tangential errors are up to one order better than the full errors for kg  2. This is visualized in Fig. 2 (a).
A third observation is that the case kg = 1 is special. In the isogeometric case we need 0 <  < 1 in order to see convergence at all. While we get the same convergence order in the tangential H1-norm for the isogeometric case kp = kg = 1,  = 0.5 compared to the non-isogeometric case kp = kg + 1,  = 1, this does not cross over to the L2-norms. The optimal order is achieved for the non-isogeometric case only, see also Fig. 3 (b). This
indicates that the penalization using normal vectors of the piecewise flat geometries does
not represent the continuous surface well enough. An improved normal field might be
desirable in this case. Those improved normals can be constructed using normal-vector averages or surface reconstruction, cf. [30, 46], or L2-projections of piecewise constant normal fields into the space Vh1 of piecewise linear functions, cf. [16, 6].
The optimal tangential H1-norm and tangential L2-norm errors for the isogeometric
case are obtained with  = 0.5, especially for low order geometries, 1  kg  2. For higher order discrete surfaces the parameter  does not show a significant influence on
these two error norms, while we still see a difference in the full discrete energy norm. The
influence of  on the convergence behavior and the optimality of  = 0.5 is visualized in Fig. 2 (b) for the tangential L2-norm errors.

5.2 Convergence results for tensor fields
For tensor field solutions, we have considered the 1-dimensional ellipse surface and the 2-dimensional sphere as geometries. In Fig. 4 (a) the errors are shown in comparison to the corresponding errors for vector fields on the ellipse and in Fig. 4 (b) a comparison of the influence of geometry orders kp of the discrete sphere grid on the tangential errors of tensor field solutions is visualized.
We find that in both settings the convergence orders show the same behavior as for vector fields.
