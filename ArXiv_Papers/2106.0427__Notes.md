## Abstract

This paper considers discrete and continuous semigroups of (weighted) composition operators on the Fock space. For discrete semigroups consisting of powers of a single operator, the asymptotic behaviour of the semigroups is analysed. For continuous semigroups and groups, a full classification of possible semigroups is given, and the generator is calculated.
