Statement from the author
This paper is wrong. The main idea is probably interesting but the statement (and obviously, the proof) are wrong. I thank Y. Genzmer for pointing out the issues which led me to realizing the mistake.
I am leaving the contents as I wrote them in case someone finds them relevant, even if only for avoiding the same mistakes.
Essentially: the Weierstrass derivation is wrongly computed everywhere. The simplest example (Genzmer) is a homogeneous cubic x3 + xy2 + y3.

IRREDUCIBILITY CRITERION FOR SINGULAR HYPERSURFACES OF (Cn, 0)
P. FORTUNY AYUSO
Abstract. Using vector fields we obtain an irreducibility criterion for hypersurfaces. It only requires the Weierstrass division.

1. Introduction and Notation
The problem of deciding whether a plane curve (in implicit form, obviously) is irreducible is of paramount importance for studying its singularity (see [1, 2, 8, 7, 5] just for several relevant examples, without any aim to completeness). The usual ways to solve it in characteristic 0 are by means of the Newton diagram (and Puiseux series) or using Approximate Roots, following Abhyankar and Moh. Both ways require "going further" than the first Puiseux exponent, and a very delicate analysis of the singularity.
In this short note we provide a criterion which, using elementary vector fields and Weierstrass division decides whether a germ of (reduced) hypersurface is or not irreducible. The result is based on the fact that vector fields can have "bad order of tangency" with a hypersurface if and only if this is reducible, because the contact structure associated to vector fields is essentially different in the reducible and irreducible cases.

2. Irreducibility criterion for hypersurface singularities

Let f : (Cn, 0)  (C, 0) define a reduced germ of hypersurface f = 0. For simplicity, we denote (x, y) a system of coordinates in (Cn, 0) such that f (x, y) is

in Weierstrass form:

k-1

(1)

f (x, y) = xk + Fi(y)xi.

i=0

where k is the multiplicity of f . From here on, we assume that k > 2 (the case

k = 2 is trivial) and F0(y) = 0 (the hypersurface does not contain x = 0). Let df denote the differential form of f and X  X(C2, 0) a germ of holomorphic vector
field in (C2, 0).

Definition 1. The tangency function of X with f (x, y) = 0 (with respect to the specific coordinate function) is the remainder R(x, y) of the Weierstrass division:

df (X) = Q(x, y)f (x, y) + R(x, y).

The tangency order of X with f (x, y) in the x-direction is the order of R(x, y) as a power series in x.

The tangency function measures, in some sense, "how" X fails to be tangent to f (x, y) = 0 [6, 3, 4], the tangency order the order of that "failure". We shall omit the qualifier "in the x-direction" because it is unnecessary in what follows.
The irreducibility criterion is the following (recall that x does not divide f (x, y)):

Theorem 1. With the notations and hypotheses above (recall that f is reduced and

k > 2), then f (x, y) = 0 is reducible if and only if there exists an integer 2  r < k

and a vector field

X

=

xr

 x

whose tangency order with f (x, y) is 0.

Proof. Assume f (x, y) = 0 is reducible and set f (x, y) = f1(x, y)f2(x, y). As f is in Weierstrass form, we can assume f1(x, y) is too and f2(x, y) is almost:

a1 -i

a2-i

f1(x, y) = xa1 +

Fi1(y)xi, f2(x, y) = u(x, y) xa2 +

Fi2(y)xi .

i=0

i=0

Let X be the vector field

X

=

xa1

+1

 x

.

As f1(x, y) has degree a1 in x, performing the Weierstrass division, we obtain xa1+1 = xf1(x, y) + R(x, y) where R(x, y) = -xF01(y) + x2S(x, y) with S(x, y) a
holomorphic function. From this:

df (X) =

f2

f1 x

+

f1

f2 x

dx + (· · · )

(xf1

R)

 x

where the dots denote an irrelevant holomorphic 1-form. This gives:

(2)

df (X)

xf12

f2 x

+

x(-F01(y)

xS(x, y))

.

The first term is a multiple of f . The second one is:

u x

= v(x, y)

2a1 +a2 -1

x2a1+a2 +

hi(y)xi

i=1

(for a unit v(x, y)). This term is not a multiple of f because f is reduced. Notice the indices starting at 1. The last term in (2) has degree a1 + a2 in x as a Weierstrass polynomial (except for a unit). Performing the Weierstrass division, we obtain:

df (X) = Q(x, y)f (x, y) - w(x, y)F01(y))2F02(y) + xT (x, y)

for a unit w(x, y) and some holomorphic function T (x, y). Thus, the contact order

of X with f = 0 is 0.
