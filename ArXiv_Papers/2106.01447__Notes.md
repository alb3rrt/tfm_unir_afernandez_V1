## Abstract

This divergence rate is a function of the defect strengths and local curvatures, thus observable configurations of defects must minimise this rate of divergence, whilst also obeying the generalisation to the Poincare-Hopf theorem we derived earlier. Thus using these principle we create a heuristic method to predict the defect strengths of a nematic shell given purely geometrical parameters and boundary data. This is then contrasted with known results from both the experimental and numerical results within the liquid crystal community.
