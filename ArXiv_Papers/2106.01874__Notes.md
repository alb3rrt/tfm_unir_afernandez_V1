## Abstract

Stochastic averaging for a class of backward stochastic differential equations driven by both standard and fractional Brownian motions (SFrBSDEs in short), is investigated. An averaged SFrBSDEs for the original SFrBSDEs is proposed, and their solutions are quantitatively compared. Under some appropriate assumptions, the solutions to original systems can be approximated by the solutions to averaged stochastic systems in the sense of mean square and also in probability.
