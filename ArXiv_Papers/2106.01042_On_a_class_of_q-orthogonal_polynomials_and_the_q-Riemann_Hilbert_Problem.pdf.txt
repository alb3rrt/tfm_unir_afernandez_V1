We give an explicit solution of a q-Riemann Hilbert problem which arises in the theory of orthogonal polynomials, prove that it is unique, and deduce several properties. Our new results include the asymptotic behaviour of zeroes in the limit as the degree of the polynomial approaches infinity.
1. Introduction
In this paper, we consider a Riemann-Hilbert problem (RHP) associated with a general class of q-orthogonal polynomials and solve it explicitly. The result is used to deduce properties of such polynomials, in particular, ladder operators, a Lax pair, a q-difference equation and, most importantly, the asymptotic behaviour of their zeroes in the limit as the degree of the polynomials approach infinity.
RHPs encapsulate many classical problems of physics and mathematics. Related problems (under certain conditions) are also known as Wiener-Hopf problems. Applications include boundary value problems in hydrodynamics, diffraction theory and radiative transfer theory [23]. More recently, RHPs have been used to describe solutions of PDEs of Korteweg-de Vries type [1, 4], exactly solvable quantum field and statistical mechanics models [20], topological and two-dimensional models of quantum gravity [18], and are particularly noteworthy as a method for describing asymptotic behaviours in the study of ensembles of random matrices [10, 11].

Orthogonal polynomials are objects of longstanding interest in mathematics and physics.

2

Classical orthogonality conditions involved continuous measures, with weight functions w(x)

defined on continuous domains. The pioneering studies of Lagrange, Laguerre, Hermite and

others focused on smooth weight functions w(x) such that w (x)/w(x) grows no faster than a

linear polynomial in x. This condition was extended in two cases by Shohat [27]. Applications in

theoretical physics have led to many more extensions studied in modern times [15, 21, 29]. These

cases led to families of functions that are now known as semi-classical orthogonal polynomials.

In this paper, we consider orthogonality conditions defined through a q-discrete measure,

that is, for given q  R, 0 < q < 1, orthogonality measures defined on the multiplicative lattice, {qn}nZ. Given an appropriate weight function on such a lattice, we consider orthogonality
conditions with respect to the Jackson integral. (We give the precise definitions in Section (b)

below.) Such polynomials, called the q-Hahn class [13, Section 18.27], satisfy relations analogous

to those satisfied by semi-classical polynomials but with the derivative operator replaced by the

q-derivative Dq (see Equation (1.3)). Known properties include ladder operators and associated

pairs of compatible linear equations, called Lax pairs. We provide a new way to deduce such

relations from the corresponding RHP.

Not all properties of q-orthogonal polynomials are known. In this paper, we provide a

new result leading to the asymptotic approximation of zeroes of q-orthogonal polynomials

corresponding to a class of q-discrete measures. This leads to a generalisation of an earlier result

found for little q-Jacobi polynomials [24, Theorem 4.1].

(a) Background
In 1991, Fokas, Its and Kitaev [15] showed how to formulate and solve RHPs for families of semi-classical orthogonal polynomials n  N Pn(x) with exponential weight functions exp(-V (x)) on the real line, where V is a polynomial of even degree and the coefficient of the highest-degree term is positive. Based on the RHP framework for orthogonal polynomials, Deift et al. [12] developed a rigorous methodology to obtain the asymptotic behaviours of the corresponding orthogonal polynomials in the limit as the degree n  +. This methodology has been extended to a wide range of other families of orthogonal polynomials.
Fokas et al. [15] also showed that the above orthogonal polynomials are related to discrete Painlevé equations through the coefficients of their 3-term recurrence relations. For a given measure dµ(x), monic orthogonal polynomials Pn(x) satisfy an orthogonality relation

Pn(x)Pm(x)dµ(x) = nn,m,

which defines n. Their 3-term recurrence relation takes the form

xPn(x) = Pn+1(x) + bnPn(x) + anPn-1(x) ,

(1.1)

where

an = n/n-1, bn = xPn(x)2dµ(x)/n.

For convenience, we take the sequence of polynomials to have initial values P-1 = 0 and P0 = 1. When V is quartic in x, actually V (z) = -x4/4, Fokas et al. deduced a difference equation for an:

an(an+1 + an + an-1) = n,

(1.2)

and called it a discrete Painlevé equation, dPI, as it has a continuum limit to the first Painlevé equation. Equation (1.2) is also known as the string equation in physics due to its appearance in the Hermitian random matrix model of quantum gravity [15].

rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc A 0000000 ..........................................................

The connection between Equation (1.2) and dPI was established by considering the Lax pair satisfied by polynomials orthogonal with respect to e-x4/4dx. Semi-classical orthogonal

3

polynomials satisfy a Lax pair given by a differential equation in the independent variable x

and an iteration in the degree n. Fokas et al. demonstrated a connection between the Lax pair, the

RHP formulation and dPI for this class of semi-classical orthogonal polynomials [16].

It is now known that many families of orthogonal polynomials have recurrence coefficients

determined by additive-type discrete Painlevé equations [8, 9, 21]. More recently, it has been

shown that the recurrence coefficients of q-orthogonal polynomials satisfy multiplicative-type

discrete Painlevé equations [5], where now the non-autonomous term in the equations is

iterated on multiplicative lattices. (For the terminology distinguishing types of discrete Painlevé

equations, we refer to Sakai [25].)

Baik et al. have described an interpolation problem [3, Interpolation Problem 1.2], which can

be considered as a discrete RHP for polynomials orthogonal with respect to a discrete point-

wise measure. They use this setting to prove a number of asymptotic results, expanding on the

approach of Deift et al. Applications of such an approach include discrete polynomials that are,

for example, orthogonal on the integer lattice. We note that its extension to the multiplicative or

q-discrete case does not appear to lead to the asymptotic estimates we find in this paper.

The gap in our knowledge of properties of q-orthogonal polynomials raises a number of

questions relevant for physics, including quantum physics. Discrete q-Hermite I polynomials

describe the dynamics of discrete quantum harmonic oscillators [2], little q-Jacobi polynomials

describe the unitary representations of the quantum group SUq(2) [22], and q-Racah polynomials

are used to describe quantum knot invariants [6]. In quantum communication, perfect state

transfer in linear spin chains is achieved when the spin chain data is related to the Jacobi matrix

of q-Krawtchouk polynomials [19]. We note that q-orthogonal polynomials also appear in other

fields, for example the birth and death process [26].

(b) Notation
For completeness, we recall some well known definitions and notations from the calculus of q-differences. These definitions can be found in [14]. Throughout the paper we will assume q  R and 0 < q < 1.

Definition 1.1. We define the q-derivative Dq, Pochhammer symbol (a; q), and Jackson integrals as follows.

(i) The q-derivative, Dq, of f (x) is defined as

f (x) - f (qx)

Dqf (x) = x(1 - q) .

(1.3)

Note that

Dq xn

=

1 - qn 1-q

xn-1

.

(ii) The Pochhammer symbol (a; q) is defined as

(a; q) = (1 - aqj ) .
j=0

(iii) There are two Jackson integrals in the literature. The Jackson integral of f (x) from 0 to 1 is defined

as

1



f (x)dqx = (1 - q) f (qk)qk .

0

k=0

(1.4a)

rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc A 0000000 ..........................................................

Similarly, the Jackson integral of f (x) from -1 to 1 is defined as

1



f (x)dqx = (1 - q) (f (qk) + f (-qk))qk .

-1

k=0

(1.4b)

Note that the results in this paper are applicable to both types of Jackson integrals. Typical
examples of q-orthogonal polynomials with a Jackson integral from -1 to 1 include: discrete q-Hermite I polynomials (with weight w(x) = (q2x2; q2)) [13, Section 18.27] and q-Freud
polynomials w(x) = x(q4x4; q4) [5] . Examples of q-orthogonal polynomials with a Jackson integral from 0 to 1 include: little q-Jacobi (w(x) = x(qx; q)/(bqx; q)) and little q-Laguerre polynomials (w(x) = x(qx; q)) [30] .

(c) Main results
Our main results hold under certain properties defined below.

Definition 1.2. A positively oriented Jordan curve  in C with interior D-  C is called appropriate if it contains the points ±qm for all integers m and does not contain ±q-l for l = 1, 2, 3.... We call w
admissible if it is a function analytic in D- and w(z)  R for z  R. Furthermore, we call w strictly positive admissible if w(z) > 0 at z = ±qm.

An example of an appropriate curve is drawn in Figure (d).

Remark 1.1. In Definition 1.2 we describe the conditions needed for q-orthogonal polynomials with Jackson integral from -1 to 1. For a Jackson integral from 0 to 1 the same definition applies with ±qk  qk.

Definition 1.3 (q-Riemann-Hilbert problem). Let  be an appropriate curve (see Definition 1.2) with interior D- and exterior D+. Let w be an admissible function in D- and define

A 2 × 2 complex matrix function Y (z), z  C, is called a solution of the q-Riemann-Hilbert problem if it satisfies the following conditions:

(i) Y (z) is analytic on C \  . (ii) Y (z) has continuous boundary values Y-(s) and Y+(s) as z approaches s   from D- and D+
respectively, where

The main results of this paper are given by the following theorems.

rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc A 0000000 ..........................................................

Theorem 1.1 (q-RHP). Let Pn(z) be the monic nth-degree orthogonal polynomial with respect to the

is a unique solution of the Riemann-Hilbert problem given in Definition (1.3).

(1.7)

Theorem 1.2. Let Pn(x) be the monic nth-degree q-orthogonal polynomial with respect to the strictly positive, symmetric, admissible weight w(x) on [-1, 0)  (0, 1], i.e.,
1
PnPmw(x)dqx = nn,m.
-1
Denote the zeroes of Pn(x) by {xi,n}ni=1. Then , for any k  N there exists 1  i  n such that xi,n  qk as n  .

Remark 1.2. Note that by the recurrence relation, Equation (1.1), q-orthogonal polynomials Pn, satisfying Theorem 1.2 are either even or odd if n is even or odd respectively. Thus, Theorem 1.2 implies that z-nPn(z)   k=0(1 - q2k/z2) as n  . Furthermore, we will show in Lemma 2.3 that there exists an upper bound on the rate of convergence proportional to M1z-2 + M2z-1.
We use these results to prove a number of properties satisfied by q-orthogonal polynomials. From Theorem 1.3, we deduce the ladder operators as well as the Lax pair satisfied by q-orthogonal polynomials. In particular, we show that the solution of the q-RHP solves a q-difference equation in the independent variable z.

(d) Outline
The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we prove Theorems 1.1 and 1.2. We begin by solving the q-RHP in Section (a). Using the q-RHP formalism, in Sections (b) and (c) we deduce the Lax pair and ladder operators respectively. In Section (d) we describe the asymptotic location of zeroes using the q-RHP. We then conclude with Section 3 where we discuss future work and summarise our results.

2. Proofs of main results
In this section, we prove Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 and provide additional results that lead to ladder operators and a Lax pair. As remarked earlier, we focus on the case of the Jackson integral from -1 to 1 (see Equation (1.4)). The results for the case of a Jackson integral from 0 to 1 follow using similar arguments.

(a) Proof of Theorem 1.1
The proof follows along the same lines as in the case of the RHP for semi-classical orthogonal polynomials given by Fokas et al. (see [12, Section 3] for a detailed proof). When moving from the semi-classical case to q-orthogonal polynomials a key step relies on the use of the Cauchy residue theorem to express a contour integral as a discrete sum.

Figure 1. Example of an appropriate curve  defined by Definition 1.3.

Proof. We show that the second row of Y must be given by Equation (1.7). A similar argument can be carried out for the first row.

It follows from the asymptotic condition, Equation (1.6), that the (1, 1) entry of Y must have leading order zn as z  . As Y(1,1) is analytic and its jump condition, Equation (1.5), is given
by the identity we immediately conclude that Y(1,1) is a monic polynomial of degree n. Similarly,
it follows that Y(2,1) is a polynomial of degree at most n - 1. We denote Y(2,1) by Qn-1.

Consider the bottom right entry of Equation (1.7). By the jump condition, Equation (1.5), we have

Y(+2,2) = Qn-1(s)w(s)h(s) + Y(-2,2) .

(2.1)

This scalar equation is solved by the Cauchy transform

1 Y(2,2)(z) = 2i

Qn-1(s)w(s)h(s) ds ,



s-z

(2.2)

which is analytic in C \  and satisfies Equation (2.1).

The only step remaining is to prove the asymptotic condition, Equation (1.6), for Y(2,2). Substituting our expression for h(s) into Equation (2.2), we find

where the sum to infinity is well defined on  , as h(s) converges as k  , and the Jackson

contribute to the integral.

Note that the asymptotic condition, Equation (1.6), holds when the last term on the RHS is zero for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n - 2. This is true iff

1
Qn-1(x)w(x)xkdqx = 0 , for k  n - 2 ,
-1

which is satisfied when Qn-1 is an orthogonal polynomial of degree n - 1 on the q-lattice with respect to the weight w(x). After appropriate scaling, and repeating the same arguments for the first row, it follows that Equation (1.7) is a solution of the q-RHP given by Definition 1.3.

Uniqueness of this solution follows from consideration of the determinate. Observe that the jump matrix J = Y--1Y+ satisfies det(J) = 1. It immediately follows that det(Y +) = det(Y -) on  . Thus, det(Y ) is an entire function. By the asymptotic condition, Equation (1.6), det(Y )  1, hence by Liouville's theorem det(Y ) = 1. As det(Y ) = 1 we can deduce Y -1 exists and is analytic in
C/ . Suppose that there exists a second solution to the q-RHP, let us denote this solution by Y . If we define M = Y Y -1, it follows that the jump conditions effectively cancel and M+ = M-. Thus,
M is entire and M  I as z  . Hence, by Liouville's theorem M = I. We conclude that Y = Y
and there is a single unique solution to the q-RHP.

(b) Lax Pair
In this section, we deduce a q-difference Lax pair for q-orthogonal polynomials from the q-RHP. The Lax pair for a solution Yn to the q-RHP can be written as:

n+1(z) = Cn(z)n(z) ,

(2.4)

n(qz) = Dn(z)n(z) ,

(2.5)

where,

w(z) 0

n(z) = Yn(z) 0

. 1

and, Cn and Dn both have polynomial entries. We first look at an iteration in n. The proof mirrors that of the semi-classical case.

rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc A 0000000 ..........................................................

Corollary 2.1. Let Yn(z) be a solution to the q-RHP defined in Theorem 1.1. Then Yn satisfies Equation

8

(2.4), where

Cn(z) =

z + cn,1 cn,3

cn,2 0

,

and cn,1, cn,2 and cn,3 are constants dependent on n.

Proof. We observe that the jump condition for the q-RHP does not depend on n. Thus Yn+1Yn-1 is entire. By considering the asymptotic condition, Equation (1.6), and using Liouville's Theorem we find

Yn+1Yn-1 =

z + cn,1 cn,3

cn,2 0

,

where cn,1, cn,2 and cn,3 are constants which can be explicitly derived using the recurrence relation Equation (1.1).

We now show that if the weight w(z) satisfies a q-difference equation of a certain form then Yn satisfies Equation (2.5). The condition on w(z) is the q analogue of the Pearson relation satisfied by semi-classical weights [29, Section 1.1.1.].

Corollary 2.2. Let Yn(z) be a solution to the q-RHP defined in Definition 1.3. Define,

w(z) 0

n(z) = Yn(z) 0

. 1

Suppose that w(qz)/w(z) is a polynomial,  (z), of degree m. Then

n(qz) = Dn(z)n(z) , where Dn(z) has polynomial entries with maximum degree m.

Proof. Define,

Dn = n(qz)n-1(z) .

We note that there may be issues due to zeroes or poles of the weight function w. However we find,

w(qz)/w(z)

Dn = Yn(qz)

0

0 1

Yn(z)-1 ,

 (z) = Yn(qz) 0

0 1

Yn(z)-1 .

(2.6)

Therefore, Dn is well defined by taking the limit near poles and zeroes of w(z). Observe that  (z) satisfies the jump condition,

where  (z) =  (qz) (i.e. it is the contour scaled by q) and by definition h(qs) = h(s). Define a new contour  which lies between  and  , such that the pole of h(z) which lies between  and  , lies on the new contour  . We can write the RHP for Dn as:

rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc A 0000000 ..........................................................

(i) Dn is analytic in C \  . (ii) Dn+(s) = Dn-(s) for s   .

9

(iii) Dn is of degree zm as z approaches infinity.

Thus Dn has polynomial entries of degree at most m. By definition of Dn we have

n(qz) = Dn(z)n(z),

 (z)-1 0

Yn(qz) = Dn(z)Yn(z) 0

. 1

Corollary 2.2 follows, as well as Equation (2.5).

Remark 2.1. Repeating the above arguments we find that Corollary 2.2 also applies to weights where w(q-1z)/w(z) is a polynomial. An example is discrete q-Hermite I polynomials whose weight satisfies w(q-1z)/w(z) = (1 - z2).

(c) Ladder operators
In this section we recover ladder operators for q-orthogonal polynomials [7] from the q-RHP. The process is similar to that of semi-classical orthogonal polynomials, the derivation of which can be found here [29, Theorem 4.1]. To avoid onerous calculations, we restrict ourselves to determining the lowering ladder operator for q-orthogonal polynomials.

Corollary 2.3. Let {Pn} n=0 be a sequence of monic q-orthogonal polynomials which satisfy a q-RHP with admissible weight w(z) such that w(±q-1) = 0. Then

DqPn(z) = An(z)Pn-1(z) - Bn(z)Pn(z) ,

where and

1 1 u(y) An(z) = n-1 -1 qz - y Pn(y)Pn(y/q)w(y)dqy ,
1 1 u(y) Bn(z) = n-1 -1 qz - y Pn(y)Pn-1(y/q)w(y)dqy ,
u(z) = Dq-1 w(z) . w(z)

Proof. Define R = Dq(Y )Y -1. Then it follows that

where the equality can be verified by direct calculation. Using the orthogonality of Pn and the geometric series Equation (2.3) we can write the RHS of Equation (2.9) as

identity,

By definition, Dq(Y ) = RY . Hence, DqY(1,1) = R(1,1)Y(1,1) + R(1,2)Y(1,2). Thus, we have just proven the form of Bn. The proof of An follows a similar argument; one finds R(1,2) using the same method as R(1,1) which gives the desired result.

(d) Proof of Theorem 1.2
The proof requires bounds on the recurrence coefficients of q-orthogonal polynomials. We start with a well known result on the zeroes of discrete orthogonal polynomials [17, Chapter 1, Theorem 2.4].

Lemma 2.1. The zeroes of q-orthogonal polynomials, with strictly positive weight w(x)dqx, are bounded by the maximum and minimum of the q-lattice (i.e. between 0 and 1, or, -1 and 1 depending on the Jackson integral chosen) and do not appear more than once between lattice points.

Proof. The proof follows by contradiction. Let {xi,n}ni=1 denote the ordered zeroes of an orthogonal polynomial, Pn, of degree n (such that xn,n < xn-1,n < ... < x1,n). Assume that for some iext, xiext,n lies outside the maximum and minimum of the q-lattice. It follows that





n



(x - xj,n)

j=1,j=iext

n
(x - xi,n)
i=1

w(x)dqx > 0 ,

where the polynomial on the left is degree n - 1, while the polynomial on the right is degree n. This contradicts the orthogonality condition. Thus, the zeroes lie between the maximum and

rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc A 0000000 ..........................................................

minimum of the q-lattice.

11

Now consider the second part of the lemma. Assume that there exists two zeroes, xi1,n and xi2,n which lie between two consecutive points (i.e. qk, qk-1) of the Jackson integral. It follows that





n



(x - xj,n)

j =1,j =i1 ,i2

n
(x - xi,n)
i=1

w(x)dqx > 0 .

This is again a contradiction to orthogonality.

Remark 2.2. Note that the roots of q-orthogonal polynomials are real. This well known observation follows from the fact that Pn must have real coefficients (from the recurrence relation Equation (1.1)), combined with Lemma 2.1. (To see this we use the same arguments as in the proof of Lemma 2.1, omitting any complex conjugate roots if required.) It also follows that the roots must be simple (again by using the same arguments in the proof of Lemma 2.1 with the omission of any multiple roots if required).

In order to prove Theorem 1.2 we will begin by using Lemma 2.1 to prove that the sum of the recurrence coefficients in Equation (1.1) is bounded.

Lemma 2.2. Given a sequence of q-orthogonal polynomials on [-1, 0)  (0, 1], with a strictly positive, symmetric, admissible weight, the recurrence coefficients an and bn defined in Equation (1.1) satisfy



1

bn



< , 1-q

n=0



2

an  (1 - q)2 < .

n=0

(2.11) (2.12)

Proof. Let

Pn(z) = zn + nzn-1 + nzn-2 + ... .

Applying Equation (1.1) we find that

n = n+1 + bn, n = n+1 + bnn + an.

(2.13) (2.14)

By definition an and bn are both positive (see Equation (1.1)). We know that -n is equal to the sum of the roots of Pn. Furthermore, by Lemma 2.1, |xk,n| is smaller then |qk-1|. Thus, n is
bounded by 1
0 < -n < 1 - q .

Hence taking the telescopic sum of Equation (2.13) gives
n
n+1 = - bi,
i=1
which implies Equation (2.11).

Similar arguments show that Equation (2.14) implies Equation (2.12).
We know from Corollary 2.1 that the two columns of the solution Yn of the q-RHP both satisfy the same three term recurrence relation, where an and bn satisfy Lemma 2.2. We will now show that they converge to analytic functions after an appropriate scaling.

Lemma 2.3. Let yn(z) be determined by the recurrence relation yn+2(z) - zyn+1(z) + bn+1yn+1(z) + an+1yn(z) = 0 ,
where |z| > 0. If an and bn satisfy Lemma 2.2, then lim yn(z)z-n  f (z),
n
where convergence is uniform in any compact domain not containing z = 0 or poles of yn.

Proof. Substituting in yn = znun the recurrence relation becomes:

un+2

un+1

bn+1 z

0.

Taking the norm we have

(2.16)

|un+2| 

1+

an+1 z2

+

bn+1 z

max(|un+1|, |un|) .

Using the above relation we can write

max(|un+2|, |un+1|) 

1+

an+1 z2

+ bn+1 z

max(|un+1|, |un|) .

Thus, it follows

n
|un|  |u0|

1+

ak+1 z2

k=0

by applying a telescopic product. Applying Lemma 2.2 we determine that the product on the RHS is bounded. Thus, |un| is bounded in any compact domain not containing z = 0. Hence, by Equation (2.16) un is a Cauchy sequence which converges as n goes to infinity. Moreover, un converges uniformly in any compact domain not containing z = 0.

Remark 2.3. It follows that we can estimate an upper bound on the rate of convergence, given by, |un(z) - f (z)|  q-n 2 ((1 - q)z)-2 + ((1 - q)z)-1 .

We now have all the ingredients to prove Theorem 1.2. First, observe that the q-RHP jump, Equation (1.5), can be written in one-dimension as

Pnhw + -(Pn) = +(Pn) ,

(2.17)

where Pn = Y(±1,1), - = Y(-1,2) and + = Y(+1,2). Motivated by the form of Equation (2.15), we multiply through by a common factor z-n to give

z-nPnhw + z-n-(Pn) = z-n+(Pn) .

Applying the results of Lemma 2.3, in the limit n goes to infinity the above becomes
f (0)(z)hw + f (1)(z) = f (2)(z) ,
where f (0) and f (1) are analytic everywhere except z = 0 and f (2) is analytic everywhere except z = 0 and z = ±qk for k  Z. The analyticity of f (i) follows from Morera's theorem as convergence is uniform in any compact domain D not containing 0 or the poles of Y(1,2).

Furthermore, we can deduce that f (2)(z) is the zero function. We know that f (2)(z) is analytic at infinity. We also know z-n+(Pn) decays as z-2nn-1 as z  . Hence, zmf (2)(z) goes to

rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc A 0000000 ..........................................................

zero for any m. By Liouville's theorem we conclude f (2)(z) is the zero function. Thus,

13

f (0)(z)hw + f (1)(z) = 0 ,

If f (0)(z) is non-zero at the poles of h(z) then by the above equation f (1)(z) must have a pole there. But f (1)(z) is analytic for z = 0 which is a contradiction. Hence, f (0)(z) must have zeroes at the poles of h(z), which are at z = ±qk for k  Z.

By definition

where zi,n are the ordered zeroes of Pn. Thus, the zeroes of f (0)(z) are the zeroes of limn Pn(z) which occur at z = ±qk for k  Z. There cannot be any more zeroes by Lemma
2.1.

We conclude this section with a final corollary which states that although the zeroes of Pn approach qk as n approaches infinity, they can never actually equal qk for any sufficiently large n.
Note that this appears to contradict Theorem 6.1.1. in [28], possibly due to typographical errors
in the published version.

Corollary 2.4. Let {Pn} n=0 be a sequence of q-orthogonal polynomials on the q-lattice [-1, 0)  (0, 1]
which satisfy a q-RHP with strictly positive, symmetric, admissible weight, w. Consider an arbitrary point on the q lattice, qk, k  N. Then there exists an Nk, which is a function of k  N, such that the zeroes of Pn for n > Nk cannot equal qk.

Proof. Let Pn(z) be a monic polynomial which satisfies a q-RHP on [-1, 0)  (0, 1] with strictly

positive, symmetric, admissible weight. Assume that for a given k, Pn(qk) = 0. As Pn has a zero

at qk is also the nth degree orthogonal polynomial for the weight w(x)dqx \ ±qk i.e. the Jackson

integral minus the location ±qk. Applying Remark 1.2 we know that there exists and Nk such

that



z-nPNk -

(1 - z-2q2j ) <


(1 - z-2q2j ) .

j=0,j=k

j=0,j=k

Thus, if n > Nk we arrive at a contradiction.

3. Conclusion
In this paper, we provided a framework for studying properties of q-orthogonal polynomials as solutions of q-RHPs. This framework enabled us to deduce certain known properties as well as new results for q-orthogonal polynomials. In particular, we deduced previously known ladder operators and provided a Lax pair which appears to be new to the best of the authors' knowledge. Furthermore, we described the asymptotic location of the zeroes of q-orthogonal polynomials.
It is interesting to note that the asymptotic location of zeroes of q-orthogonal polynomials appears to differ from that of semi-classical orthogonal polynomials. This may be due to the discrete nature of the weight function for q-orthogonal polynomials, which manifests itself as a lack of analyticity in the RHP jump function. However, the RHP for both semi-classical and qorthogonal polynomials can be used to prove the form of the ladder operators and Lax pairs they respectively satisfy.
An interesting avenue for future exploration of the q-RHP is to determine a form of strong asymptotics in the same vein as the previous work of Deift et al. [12] for semiclassical orthogonal polynomials. We note that there has been some work done in this area concerning discrete polynomials [3]. However, these results do not seem very applicable to the q-orthogonal polynomials discussed in this paper. In particular, they do not accurately describe

rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc R Soc A 0000000 ..........................................................

the exponentially vanishing behaviour of the recurrence coefficients. It is hoped that the q-RHP

14

representation will provide a good framework to explore the strong asymptotics of q-orthogonal

polynomials.
