ABSTRACT
Ultra-compact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) are low-mass X-ray binaries with hydrogen-deficient mass-donors and ultra-short orbital periods. They have been suggested to be the potential Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) sources in the low-frequency region. Several channels for the formation of UCXBs have been proposed so far. In this article, we carried out a systematic study on the He star donor channel, in which a neutron star (NS) accretes matter from a He main-sequence star through Roche-lobe overflow, where the mass-transfer is driven by the gravitational wave radiation. Firstly, we followed the long-term evolution of the NS+He main-sequence star binaries by employing the stellar evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, and thereby obtained the initial parameter spaces for the production of UCXBs. We then used these results to perform a detailed binary population synthesis approach to obtain the Galactic rates of UCXBs through this channel. We estimate the Galactic rates of UCXBs appearing as LISA sources to be  3.1 - 11.9 × 10-6yr-1 through this channel, and the number of such UCXB-LISA sources in the Galaxy can reach about 100 - 390. The present work indicates that the He star donor channel cannot be ignored in forming UCXB-LISA sources. We found that the evolutionary tracks of UCXBs through this channel can account for the location of the five transient sources with relatively long orbital periods quite well. We also found that such UCXBs can be identified by their locations in the period-mass transfer rate diagram.

1 INTRODUCTION
Ultra-compact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) are a sub-type of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), containing a compact accretor and a hydrogen-deficient mass-donor with an ultra-short orbital period (usually less than 1 hour; for a review see Nelemans & Jonker 2010). They are a kind of accretion-powered X-ray sources, in which the accretor could be a neutron star (NS) or a stellar-mass black hole (BH) that is accreting matter from a mass-donor through Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF; e.g. Savonije, de Kool & van den Heuvel 1986). So far, there

are about 40 known UCXBs or candidates, in which 15 of them have been identified with high confidence on the basis of the observed orbital periods (including 10 persistent sources and 5 transient sources; e.g. in't Zand, Jonker & Markwardt 2007; Liu, van Paradijs & van den Heuvel 2007; Heinke et al. 2013; Cartwright et al. 2013; Coti Zelati et al. 2021). It has been suggested that all confirmed UCXBs contain NS accretors, but the nature of accretors has not been identified exclusively in the observations (e.g. Sazonov et al. 2020; Coti Zelati et al. 2021). Note that UCXBs with BH accretors have not been confirmed, but there is a known moderately strong BH UCXB candidate 47 Tuc X9 in our Galaxy (see Bahramian et al. 2017). To date, about a third of observed UCXBs have been found in dense globular clusters that can enhance UCXB production owing to dynamical interactions, such as tidal captures or stellar encounters (e.g. Verbunt 1987; Bailyn & Grindlay 1987; Davies, Benz & Hills 1992; Podsiadlowski, Rappaport & Pfahl 2002; Ivanova et al. 2005, 2010).
UCXBs play an important role in broad aspects of astrophysics, as follows: (1) UCXBs have been thought to be strong continuous gravitational wave (GW) sources in the lowfrequency region ( 10-4 -10-3 Hz), which can be detected by the space GW detectors, such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA; e.g. Nelemans 2009; Amaro-Seoane et al. 2017; Tauris 2018), Taiji (e.g. Luo et al. 2020; Ruan et al. 2020, 2021), and TianQin (e.g. Luo et al. 2016; Bao et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2019; Huang et al. 2020), etc. (2) UCXBs provide important constraints on the binary evolution, such as the angular-momentum loss mechanisms, the common-envelope evolution and the mass-accretion process, etc (e.g. Zhu, Lu¨ & Wang 2012). (3) UCXBs are excellent astrophysical laboratories, since they are interesting X-ray sources and also the combination of ultra-short orbital periods, compact accretors and mass-donors with different chemical compositions (e.g. Nelemans & Jonker 2010; Lin & Yu 2018). (4) UCXBs have been proposed to be progenitor candidates of radio millisecond pulsars (e.g. van Haaften et al. 2012, and references therein).
Due to the ultra-short orbital periods, the mass-donors in UCXBs could be constrained to be hydrogen-deficient, partially or fully degenerate stars, such as white-dwarfs (WDs) or non-degenerate naked He stars (e.g. Rappaport, Joss & Webbink 1982; Nelson, Rappaport & Joss 1986; Podsiadlowski, Rappaport & Pfahl 2002; Deloye & Bildsten 2003; Zhong & Wang 2011). In addition, the spectra in some UCXBs indicate that the accreted matter onto NSs mainly consists of helium or carbon and oxygen, which may help to identify the mass-donors (e.g. Nelemans et al. 2004; Nelemans, Jonker & Steeghs 2006). Especially, thermonuclear (type I) X-ray bursts on the surface of NSs show distinct features in dependence of the accreted matter, which can be used to constrain the composition of the mass-donors in UCXBs (see, e.g. Cumming 2003; Galloway et al. 2008). van Haaften, Voss & Nelemans (2012) recently obtained the compositions of the mass-donors in 10 UCXBs, in which about half of them are likely to be rich in helium.
Up to now, several channels and their variants for the formation of UCXBs have been proposed based on the nature of the mass-donors (for a review see Nelemans & Jonker 2010). In the classical channel, a NS accretes matter from a WD through RLOF, in which the WD fills its Roche-lobe due to the rapid orbital shrinkage induced by the GW radiation, known as the WD donor channel (e.g. Pringle & Webbink 1975; Tutukov & Yungelson 1993; Iben, Tutukov & Yungelson 1995; Yungelson, Nelemans & van den Heuvel 2002; Belczynski & Taam 2004; van Haaften et al. 2012a; Jiang, Chen & Li 2017; Yu, Lu & Jeffery 2021). Sengar et al. (2017) performed a number of complete binary computations for the formation of UCXBs through stable mass-transfer from He WDs to NSs, and suggested that this channel can account for the properties of observed UCXBs with high helium abundances. Bobrick, Davies & Church (2017) recently argued that only binaries containing He WDs with masses less than 0.2 M can undergo stable mass-transfer and then form UCXBs. By

using a newly suggested magnetic braking prescription from Van, Ivanova & Heinke (2019), Chen et al. (2021) recently found that the initial orbital period range of LMXBs forming UCXBs becomes significantly wider. It has been suggested that at least one hundred UCXBs will be detected by the LISA in the Galaxy based on the WD donor channel (see Tauris 2018).
Podsiadlowski, Rappaport & Pfahl (2002) suggested that LMXBs consisting of a NS and a main-sequence (MS) donor with the initial orbital periods below the bifurcation period can also evolve into UCXBs, known as the MS donor channel.1 van der Sluys, Verbunt & Pols (2005a,b) carried out a number of complete binary computations for this channel, and explored the bifurcation period of LMXBs that can evolve to UCXBs. It has been suggested that the bifurcation period is sensitive to the angular-momentum loss mechanisms, especially the magnetic braking laws and the mass-loss prescriptions (e.g. Ergma 1996; Podsiadlowski, Rappaport & Pfahl 2002; Ma & Li 2009a; Shao & Li 2015; Chen et al. 2017; Deng et al. 2021). It is worth noting that part of the current LMXBs may originate from the evolution of intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs) that appear as LMXBs in most of their X-ray active lifetime (e.g. Podsiadlowski, Rappaport & Pfahl 2002; Li 2002, 2015; Xu & Li 2007; Lin et al. 2011; Shao & Li 2012). Chen & Podsiadlowski (2016) argued that the pre-IMXBs with initial orbital periods much near the bifurcation period can evolve towards UCXBs via the magnetic braking caused by the coupling between the magnetic field and an irradiationdriven wind. Chen, Liu & Wang (2020) recently suggested that pre-LMXB/IMXB systems need fine-tuning in the initial orbital period (much near the bifurcation period) to produce detached pre-UCXBs (see also Istrate, Tauris & Langer 2014). In addition, as a variant of the MS donor channel, Ma & Li (2009b) proposed an alternative channel for the formation of UCXBs by considering circumbinary disk-driven mass-transfer.
A NS can also accrete matter from a non-degenerate He star via RLOF, where the masstransfer is driven by the GW radiation, known as the He star donor channel (e.g. Savonije, de Kool & van den Heuvel 1986; Heinke et al. 2013). Savonije, de Kool & van den Heuvel (1986) first calculated the evolution of an ultra-compact binary with a He star donor, and confirmed that NSs can indeed be accompanied by low-mass He stars. Heinke et al. (2013) argued that the He star donor channel may account for the formation of three persistent UCXBs with relatively long orbital periods (40-60 minutes) and high mass-transfer rates, but they did not perform complete binary computations. By using a binary population synthesis (BPS) approach, Zhu, Lu¨ & Wang (2012) roughly estimated that about 50%-80% of UCXBs have naked He star donors. However, the parameter space and the rate for the production of UCXBs through this channel are still highly uncertain.
In Paper I (Chen, Liu & Wang 2020), we carried out a systematic study on the detectability of UCXBs by LISA through the MS donor channel, and roughly estimated that the number of UCXB-LISA sources may reach 240-320 in the Galaxy. Following the Paper I, the purpose of this article is to investigate the formation and evolution of UCXBs through the He star donor channel in a systematic way, and then to explore their detectability by the LISA, Taiji and TianQin in the Galaxy. In Section 2, we describe the numerical code and methods for binary evolution calculations. The binary evolutionary results are shown in Section 3. We describe the BPS method and present the BPS results in Section 4. Finally, a discussion is given in Section 5, and a summary in Section 6.
1 LMXBs with the initial orbital periods less than the bifurcation period will produce converging systems, otherwise they will form diverging systems (see Pylyser & Savonije 1988, 1989).

2 BINARY EVOLUTION CALCULATIONS

In NS+He star systems with tight orbits, the GW radiation makes the orbit shrink until the He stars fill their Roche-lobes. And then, the He stars start to transfer matter onto the surface of the NSs, resulting in the mass increase of NSs. To investigate the formation of UCXBs through the He star donor channel systematically, it is necessary to carry out detailed binary evolution computations. Employing the stellar evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA, version 12778; see Paxton et al. 2011, 2013, 2015, 2018, 2019), we simulated the long-term evolution of NS+He star systems for the formation of UCXBs. The loss of orbital angular-momentum from the GW radiation is considered by using a standard formula from Landau & Lifshitz (1971),

+ M2) ,

(1)

where MNS, M2, a, G and c are the mass of the NS, the mass of the He star donor, the orbital separation of the binary, the gravitational constant, and the vacuum speed of light,

respectively. In our simulations, we constructed a grid of binary models for a typical Pop-

ulation I (Pop I) metallicity Z = 0.02, in which the He star models are composed of 98%

helium and 2% metallicity. For the He star models, we built He stars with zero-age through

MESA in idealized methods; we neglect all nuclear reactions during their formation, leading

to uniform elemental abundance profile from the inside out (see also Wong & Schwab 2019).

During the binary evolution, the He star donor transfers some of its matter and angular-

momentum to the NS once it fills its Roche-lobe. Instead of solving the stellar structure

equations of NSs, we set the NSs as point masses and adopt the prescription of Tauris & van

den Heuvel (2006) for the mass-transfer efficiency with  = 0,  = 0.5 and  = 0, in which

,  and  are the fractions of the mass-loss from the vicinity of the He star donor in the

form of the stellar wind, the mass-loss from the vicinity of the NS, and the circum-binary co-planar toroid, respectively.2 Accordingly, we define the mass-accretion rate (M acc) onto the NS as M acc = (1 - )M 2, where M 2 is the mass-transfer rate. If M acc is larger than the Eddington accretion rate (M Edd), we assume that the unprocessed matter is ejected from the vicinity of the NS, taking away the specific orbital angular-momentum of the accreting NS (see also Paper I). For He accretion, we set M Edd to be 3 × 10-8 M yr-1 (e.g. Dewi et al. 2002; Chen, Li & Xu 2011). It has been suggested that the transient behavior in X-ray

binaries result from the thermal-viscous instability of accretion discs (e.g. King, Kolb &

Burderi 1996; Dubus et al. 1999). In the present work, we rely on the stability criterion

based on the irradiated pure helium discs (see, e.g. Lasota, Dubus & Kruk 2008; Heinke et

al. 2013). If the NS+He star systems evolve into UCXBs with orbital periods Porb < 1 - 2 hours,
they may potentially be detected by the low-frequency GW detectors like the LISA, Taiji

and TianQin. Here, we set the critical orbital period of UCXBs to be 1 hour (e.g. Nelemans &

Jonker 2010). Once the calculated characteristic strain is larger than the LISA sensitivity, we

assume that the corresponding UCXBs are LISA sources. In this article, similar to previous

studies (e.g. Tauris 2018; Chen 2020), we adopted the characteristic strain amplitude of

UCXBs based on 4 yr of LISA observations, written as

hc  2.5 × 10-20

2 Similar to previous studies (e.g. Podsiadlowski, Rappaport & Pfahl 2002; Paper I), we also arbitrarily set  to be 0.5 in this work. We have computed some models with  = 0.7, and we found that the  value has no significant influence on the final results.

in which d is the distance from the source to the detector, and the GW frequency is defined
as fGW = 2/Porb where Porb is the orbital period of the binary. For a simplification, we used a formula related to fGW to describe the chirp mass, expressed as

Mchirp

(3)

in which fGW is the derivative of the GW frequency (e.g. Tauris 2018). In principle, Eq. (3) can only be applied in a detached binary, in which the orbital angular-momentum loss is fully contributed by the GW radiation. However, the mass-transfer between two components of UCXBs and the mass loss of the system also have influence on the orbital evolution. Therefore, a dynamical chirp mass was defined (see Eq. 4 in Tauris 2018). Especially, the GW frequency will decrease in the orbit expanding stage, resulting in a negative chirp (e.g.
Kremer et al. 2017).
We incorporated the prescriptions above into MESA and evolved a large number of NS+He MS star systems for producing UCXBs, thus obtaining a large, dense model grid of binaries. In our simulations, the initial parameter ranges of NS+He star systems were chosen as follows: (1) The initial masses of the NS, MNi S, is set to be 1.4 M. (2) The initial masses of the He star donors, M2i, range from 0.32 M (the minimum mass for He star to ignite helium in its centre) to 1.20 M (the maximum mass of He MS star for producing an UCXB), where we used an equal step of M2 to be 0.1 M. (3) The initial orbital periods of the binaries, Poirb, change from the minimum value (at which a He star with zero-age fills its Roche-lobe) to the maximum value (at which the He star fills its Roche-lobe when its
central He is exhausted), where we set  log Porb to be 0.1.

3 BINARY EVOLUTION RESULTS
We performed a large number of complete binary evolution computations of NS+He MS star systems for the formation of UCXBs. Table 1 lists the main evolutionary parameters of some typical NS+He star systems that can evolve into UCXBs. In this table, we first mainly

explored the effect of different initial He star masses on the final results (see sets 1 - 5), and then the effect of different initial orbital periods (see sets 6 - 11).

3.1 A typical example for binary evolution
Fig. 1 shows a typical example of the evolution of a NS+He star system that can form an UCXB (see set 2 in Table 1). The initial parameters for this binary are (M2i , MNi S, log(Poirb/d)) = (0.40, 1.40, -1.80), in which M2i , MNi S and Poirb are the initial mass of the He star and the NS in solar mass, and the initial orbital period in days, respectively. Due to the short initial orbital period, the angular-momentum loss induced by the GW radiation is large enough to result in the rapid shrinking of the orbital separation. After about 0.37 Myr, the He star begins to fill its Roche-lobe while it is still in the He-core burning stage (case BA mass-transfer; see Dewi et al. 2002). After the beginning of the mass-transfer, the binary appears to be a persistent UCXB soon. The binary shows as a persistent source lasting for 46.6 Myr.
The binary undergoes severe orbital angular-momentum loss through the GW radiation and thus keeps much high mass-transfer rates during the UCXB stage. After about 4.15 Myr, the He star decreases its mass to 0.236 M and the binary evolves to the minimum orbital period (Pomrbin = 10.47 minutes). At this stage, helium burning in the centre of the He star starts to fade. After that, the binary orbit starts to expand, and the mass-transfer rate begins to decrease (for more discussions see Sect. 3.2). The binary appears to be an UCXB lasting for about 2.8 Gyr based on a critical orbital period of 1 hour. When the He star donor decreases its mass to 0.0052 M, the evolutionary code stops because of hitting the equation of state (EOS) limits (max log Q > 5; a MESA default value). At this moment, the lifetime of the binary is 7.27 Gyr, the mass of the NS is MNf S = 1.585 M, and the orbital period is Pofrb = 74.88 minutes.

3.2 Evolutionary tracks of UCXBs
Fig. 2 presents the evolutionary tracks of five typical UCXBs with different initial He star masses (see sets 1 - 5 in Table 1) in the orbital period versus the secondary mass diagram. These NS+He star systems would directly evolve into UCXBs once the He star donors fill their Roche-lobes. During the UCXB stage, the angular-momentum loss is dominated by the GW radiation. When the masses of the He star donors drop below  0.3 M, the minimum orbital periods of these binaries will be approached soon. The minimum orbital periods of UCXBs in the present work are in the range of 8 - 10 minutes, which are larger than that in NS+He WD systems a little bit (5 - 7 minutes; see, e.g. Sengar et al. 2017; Paper I). The main reason is that He WDs are more compact than He star donors. At the stage of the minimum orbital periods, helium burning in the centre of the He star donors is gradually extinguished. Meanwhile, the He star donors gradually reach a state of mildly degenerate, indicating that their mass-radius exponent is negative.
In Fig. 2, we note that the NS+He star system with M2i = 0.32 M has a lower minimum orbital period. This is because this system contains a slightly more massive donor at the moment of the minimum orbital period (see Table 1), which is more compact than that of a less massive one for degenerate stars. With the evolution of the UCXBs, the masses of the donors and the mass-transfer rates become lower and lower after the minimum orbital periods (see Fig. 3). Meanwhile, the binary orbits gradually widen (see Fig. 2), resulting from the mass and radius relation for degenerate mass-donors whereby they expand in response to mass-loss (see also Savonije, de Kool & van den Heuvel 1986; Sengar et al. 2017). These binaries appear to be UCXBs lasting for about 1.5 - 4.0 Gyr. The NS systems studied here will eventually form single millisecond radio pulsars or pulsar+planet-like systems, in which the pulsars have been regenerated by mass-accretion induced spin-up (for more discussions see Sect. 5). Note that the NS+He star system represented by set 5 quickly enters into mass-transfer stage due to the short orbital period, leading to the formation of an UCXB. After about 20.45 Myr, as shown in Fig. 2, the binary evolves to the minimum orbital period, after which we suffer from some numerical difficulties for the evolution of the NS system (a similar case, see set 11 in Table 1) .

The dotted line is M Edd for a NS that is accreting He-rich material.

Fig. 4 represents the evolutionary tracks of four typical UCXBs with different initial He star masses (see sets 1 - 4 in Table 1) in the mass-transfer rate versus the orbital period diagram. The evolutionary tracks in this diagram exist two stages (see also Sengar et al. 2017), as follows: (1) The ascending stage. The orbital periods continue to decrease due to the GW radiation after the He star donors fill their Roche-lobes, whereas the tracks of the mass-transfer rates enter into the ascending stage until the tip at the minimum orbital periods. (2) The declining stage. Following the minimum orbital periods, the tracks of the mass-transfer rates get into the declining stage while the orbital periods increase. The observed UCXBs are much more likely to be on the declining stage as their evolutionary lifetime are much longer than a Gyr along this stage (see also Deloye & Bildsten 2003; Nelemans et al. 2010; Sengar et al. 2017).
As shown in Fig. 4, our UCXB tracks can explain the location of the five transient sources with relatively long orbital periods quite well, especially for Swift J1756.9-2508 that cannot be reproduced by the WD donor channel. For a comparison, in this figure we also plot the numerical relation fit between the mass-transfer rate and the orbital period based on the NS+He WD channel (see Sengar et al. 2017) and the low-entropy evolutionary tracks for degenerate O donors based on the NS+CO WD channel (see Deloye & Bildsten 2003). We note that most of UCXBs are consistent with the evolutionary tracks of the NS+He WD channel. Meanwhile, one UCXB (2S 0918-549) can be reproduced by a low-entropy CO WD donor, consistent with carbon and oxygen lines in its optical spectra (see Deloye & Bildsten 2003).
However, three persistent sources that have relatively long orbital periods (40-60 minutes) and high mass-transfer rates (> 10-10 M yr-1), are inconsistent with the tracks of the WD donor channel (see also Heinke et al. 2013). In the three persistent sources, one UCXB (4U 1916-053) exhibits strong helium lines in its optical spectra (probably containing a He star donor; e.g. Nelemans, Jonker & Steeghs 2006), and two UCXBs (4U 1626-67 and 4U 0614+091) clearly show the lack of hydrogen and helium lines but present carbon and oxygen lines in their optical spectra (likely having CO WD donors; see, e.g. Nelemans et al. 2004, 2006; Werner et al. 2006). In the present work, the ascending stage of massive He star

Evolutionary tracks of four typical UCXBs with different initial He star masses (see sets 1 - 4 in Table 1) in the mass-transfer rate vs. the orbital period diagram, where the tracks follow the direction of the black arrows. For a comparison, in this figure we also plot the theoretical evolutionary tracks of the mass-transfer rates on the declining stage based on the NS+He WD channel and the NS+CO WD channel. The black dashed line shows the numerical relation fit between the mass-transfer rate and the orbital period based on the NS+He WD channel (see Sengar et al. 2017), whereas the red dashed line presents the low-entropy evolutionary tracks for degenerate O donors based on the NS+CO WD channel (see Deloye & Bildsten 2003). More details of the orbital period and the mass-transfer rate changing with the secondary mass can be found in Figs 2 and 3. The solid squares, solid circles, and open circles denote seven persistent sources with short orbital periods, three persistent sources and five transient sources with relatively long orbital periods (40-60 minutes), respectively. The observational data are taken from Heinke et al. (2013). Note that the upper and lower error estimates for mass-transfer rates are still not well determined, and the orbital periods of two UCXBs (i.e. 4U 1728-34 and 4U 0614+091) may not be correct in these observational data (see Heinke et al. 2013).

donors could pass near 4U 1916-053, but the passage time through that region is too short. The descending stage instead goes too far below the three persistent sources (see Fig 4). It has been argued that 4U 1626-67 was produced through accretion induced collapse of an ONe WD accretor, likely containing a neon-enriched donor (see Yungelson, Nelemans & van
den Heuvel 2002). For more discussions on the formation of the three persistent sources, see Sect. 5.
In Fig. 4, we note that the mass-transfer rates on the declining stage have a bifurcation after Porb > 0.02 d through the He star donor channel, where the mass-donors become lower than 0.06 M. This bifurcation also appears for cases with different initial orbital periods (see Fig. 5). Fig. 6 shows the evolutionary tracks of UCXB donor stars for M2i = 0.40 M with different initial orbital periods in the central temperature versus the central mass density diagram. As shown in this figure, the bifurcation may be mainly caused by the central temperature of the mass-donor; a mass-donor with higher central temperature (higher central
carbon mass-fraction) has lower degeneracy, resulting in higher mass-transfer rates on the declining stage.

3.3 Gravitational wave signals
The observation of GW radiation has started a new astronomical era after the detection of high-frequency GW signals from the first double black hole coalescence event (GW150914) by the ground-based aLIGO/Virgo (see Abbott et al. 2016). The second historic moment is the GW detection of the first double NS coalescence event (GW170817) together with the entire electromagnetic spectrum from gamma-rays to radio signals, becoming a milestone in multi-messenger astrophysics (see Abbott et al. 2017). UCXBs have been thought to be the

Owing to the continuous massaccretion, they provide a favorable advantage to carry out full multi-messenger investigations in both electromagnetic spectrum and GW signals.
Fig. 7 shows the evolutionary tracks of the four typical UCXBs with different initial He star masses (see sets 1 - 4 in Table 1) in the characteristic strain amplitude versus the GW frequency diagram. We suppose that an UCXB can be visible as a LISA source once the calculated characteristic strain is larger than the LISA sensitivity. Note that this assumption only provides an upper limit for the estimation of UCXB-LISA source number. From this figure, we can see that UCXBs through the He star donor channel can be detected by the future space-based GW observatories like LISA, Taiji and TianQin. Due to the short initial

The upper and under curves represent the binary evolution results based on the distance of 15 kpc and 100 kpc from the source to the detectors, respectively. The sensitivity curve for the future space-based GW observatory LISA is from the numerical calculations based on 4 yr of observations (see Robson et al. 2018). For comparison, in this figure we also present the Taiji sensitivity curve (see Ruan et al. 2020) and the TianQin sensitivity curve (see Wang et al. 2019).

orbital periods, the preceding detached NS+He star binaries will be also detected by the GW observatories and would be observable as binary radio pulsars. Meanwhile, the sources will be both seen as persistent UCXBs and GW sources simultaneously after the onset of the mass-transfer. With the evolution of an UCXB, the peak characteristic strain approaches when the minimum orbital period is coming. In our simulations, all NS+He star systems forming UCXBs can be detectable by the LISA within a distance of 15 kpc. At distances up to the edge of the Galaxy (100 kpc), they are even be visible as LISA sources. The average tLISA within a distance of 15 kpc is about 33 Myr in our simulations (see Table 1). We also note that most of UCXBs produced by the MS donor channel can only be visible by LISA within a distance of 1 kpc (see Paper I). Compared with the MS donor channel, UCXBs through the He star donor channel are easier to be discovered by LISA.

3.4 Initial parameters of NS+He star systems
We evolved a large number of NS+He MS star systems for the formation of UCXBs, and thereby obtained a large, dense model grid of binaries. Fig. 8 presents the initial contour for producing UCXBs in the log P i - M2i plane, where P i and M2i are the initial orbital period and the initial mass of the He star donor, respectively. If the initial parameters of a NS+He star system are located in the contours, an UCXB is then supposed to be formed. Thus, the contours can be expediently used in BPS simulations to study the formation of UCXBs. In our calculations, the estimated minimum orbital periods of UCXBs with He star donors are close to 8 minutes (see set 1 in Fig. 2). We also found that NS+He star systems initialised at wider orbits and coming into contact due to GW radiation would also be observed as UCXBs (see also Fig. 5). Note that all UCXBs in this contour can be visible as the LISA sources within a distance of 15 kpc, and they will be still detectable as the LISA sources within a distance of 100 kpc.

Figure 8. Regions in the initial orbital period­secondary mass plane (log P i, M2i ) for NS+He star binaries that can produce UCXBs, in which the initial mass of NSs is assumed to be 1.4 M. The filled triangles and open circles stand for the binaries resulting in the formation of UCXBs. For the binaries represented by the filled triangles, the evolutionary code terminates because of hitting EOS limits. For the binaries marked by the open circles, the evolutionary code stops due to the numerical difficulties we suffered after the minimum orbital period (e.g. set 5 in Fig. 2). Crosses are for those that the He star fills its Roche-lobe when it evolves to the subgiant stage.
The initial parameter space for producing UCXBs is constrained by the following conditions: (1) The left boundary of the contour is set by the condition that RLOF starts when the He star is on the zero-age MS stage. (2) The lower boundary is constrained by the requirements that the masses of He stars in close binaries with solar metallicities should be larger than 0.32 M, below which helium burning in their centre would be extinguished (see also Han et al. 2002; Yungelson 2008). (3) These systems beyond the right boundary start mass-transfer when the He stars are on the subgiant stage and have CO cores. Note that systems close to the right boundary can also form UCXBs when the He stars evolve to the subgiant stage, but we did not consider this case in the present work.
4 BPS ASSUMPTIONS AND RESULTS 4.1 BPS assumptions To investigate the Galactic rates of UCXBs through the He star donor channel, a series of Monte Carlo BPS simulations are carried out based on the rapid binary star evolution (BSE) code developed by Hurley, Tout & Pols (2002). The principle assumptions and basic BPS setup in this work are similar to those of Paper I, but here we adopted the updated initial parameter space of the He star donor channel for producing UCXBs. In the BPS approach, the primordial binary samples are obtained in the way of Monte Carlo. In each simulation, a sample of 1 ×107 primordial binaries are tracked until the formation of NS+He star systems. We assume that an UCXB would be formed when the initial parameters of a NS+He star system are located in the UCXB parameter space of Fig. 8. Note that the He stars from the BSE code here are identified with He stars initialised in MESA simulations.
NS+He star systems for producing UCXBs have most likely emerged from the commonenvelope (CE) evolution of giant binaries as they have ultra-short orbital periods. We assume that the mass-transfer would be dynamically unstable and a CE would be formed when the mass-ratio of the binary is larger than a critical value (qc; see Paczyn´ski 1976). It has been

generally thought that qc changes with the evolutionary stage of the primordial primary once it fills its Roche-lobe (e.g. Hjellming & Webbink 1987; Podsiadlowski, Rappaport &
Pfahl 2002; Han et al. 2002). In this work, we set qc = 4 once the primary is in the MS or Hertzsprung gap stage (e.g. Han, Tout & Eggleton 2000; Chen & Han 2003). When the
mass donor is a red-giant (RG) star or an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star, we adopt

where Mc1, M1 and x = d ln R1/d ln M1 are the core mass of the donor, the donor mass and the mass-radius exponent of the donor, respectively (see Hurley, Tout & Pols 2002).
The CE ejection process is still highly uncertain (e.g. Ivanova et al. 2013; Soker 2013; Soker, Grichener & Sabach 2018). As in our previous studies (e.g. Wang et al. 2009), the standard energy prescription is adopted to calculate the CE evolution (see Webbink 1984), in which we combine the CE ejection efficiency (CE) and the stellar structure parameter () into a free parameter CE and set it to be 1.0 as our standard model. Note that other energy sources (e.g. the internal energy of the envelope) may also contribute to the CE ejection (see Han, Podsiadlowski & Eggleton 1995). Thus, we consider the effect of a large value of CE (i.e. 1.5) on the final results for a comparison.
The following input is adopted in our BPS Monte Carlo simulations (for a recent review see Han et al. 2020; see also Han 2008; Wang, Podsiadlowski & Han 2017): (1) We used the initial mass function from Miller & Scalo (1979). (2) All stars are assumed to be members of binaries, and a constant mass-ratio distribution is adopted. (3) A circular orbit is supposed for the primordial binaries. (4) The orbital separation distribution is supposed to be constant in log a for wide primordial binaries, in which a is the orbital separation of the binary. (5) A constant star formation rate (SFR) is assumed over the past 15 Gyr, in which we suppose that a primordial binary system with its primary > 0.8 M is produced every year (see Han, Podsiadlowski & Eggleton 1995; Hurley, Tout & Pols 2002). From this calibration, a constant SFR of 5 Myr-1 can be obtained (see Willems & Kolb 2004).

14 Wang et al.
4.2 BPS results
Fig. 9 shows the evolution of the Galactic rates of UCXBs for the He star donor channel by adopting a constant Pop I SFR of 5 Myr-1. The simulations give the theoretical rates of He star UCXBs in the Galaxy to be  3.1 - 11.9 × 10-6yr-1. If we adopt the timescale of UCXBs appearing as LISA sources to be 33 Myr within a distance of 15 kpc (see Table 1), there exist about 100 - 390 UCXB-LISA sources in the Galaxy. The present work indicates that the He star donor channel cannot be ignored when studying UCXB-LISA sources.
We note that there are about 6 persistent UCXBs in the field (e.g. Heinke et al. 2013). Persistent UCXBs have lifetimes of about 30 - 100 Myr (e.g. Tauris 2018; paper I), and they are believed to be detectable in the whole Galaxy. Thus, the empirical formation rate for persistent UCXBs is about 6/(30-100) Myr-1 = (0.06-0.2)×10-6 yr-1, at least providing a lower limit for their number estimation. Additionally, persistent UCXBs can be also formed through the WD/MS donor channels. Therefore, the theoretical UCXB rate from the He star donor channel seems to be well above the observed rate. The main reason for such a discrepancy is due to some uncertainties in our BPS simulations, as follows: (1) Other Galactic models have already predicted several times smaller SFRs. For example, Licquia & Newman (2014) recently suggested a lower Galactic SFR of 1.66 Myr-1 based on a hierarchical Bayesian statistical analysis. If this SFR is adopted, the theoretical UCXB rate will decrease to be  1.0 - 4.0 × 10-6yr-1 in the Galaxy. (2) Recent simulations imply that the stability criteria for RG mass-transfer is likely to be larger than the adopted value here (e.g. Ge et al. 2020). This indicates that we may slightly overestimate the rates of NS+He star systems.
As shown in Fig. 9, there exist two obvious ascending stages for the evolution of UCXB rates, i.e. with the delay time around 100 Myr and 300 Myr from the star formation to the formation of UCXBs. These two cases correspond to two specific evolutionary scenarios for the formation of NS+He star systems, in which the primordial primaries first fill their Rochelobes and then form CEs (1) at the RG stage for the case with short delay times and (2) at the AGB stage for the case with long delay times. For scenario (1), the initial parameters of the primordial binaries are in the range of M1,i  10 - 25 M, q = M2,i/M1,i  0.1 - 0.3 and P i  20 - 2000 days, in which M1,i, M2,i, P i and q are the initial masses of the primordial primary and secondary, the initial orbital period and mass-ratio of the primordial systems, respectively. About 15% of UCXBs from the He star donor channel are produced through this scenario. For scenario (2), the initial parameters of the primordial binaries are in the range of M1,i  7 - 15 M, q  0.2 - 0.8 and P i  600 - 4000 days. About 85% of UCXBs from the He star donor channel are formed through this scenario.
5 DISCUSSION
It has been argued that the He star donor channel may produce the higher average masstransfer rates in the three persistent UCXBs with relatively long orbital periods if the He star donors can retain their initial high entropy (see Heinke et al. 2013). In the present work, we found that a He star donor with higher central temperature (higher central carbon massfraction) has lower degeneracy, corresponding to higher mass-transfer rates on the declining stage. Note that we did not consider the irradiation effect of X-ray luminosities of massaccreting NSs on the evolution of UCXBs, which may also trigger higher mass-transfer rates (e.g. van Haaften, Voss & Nelemans 2012; Jia & Li 2015; Lu¨ et al. 2017). Thus, we speculate that the He star donor channel has the potential ability to account for the formation of the three persistent sources with higher mass-transfer rates, especially for 4U 1916-053 that

UCXBs with He star companions 15
probably has a He star donor. If the three persistent sources really originate from the He star donor channel, we expect the initial He star mass larger than 0.6 M. In this work, we suffer from some numerical difficulties for the evolution of NS systems with the central carbon abundances of the mass-donors higher than 20% when the binary orbits gradually widen (see, e.g. set 5 in Fig. 2). Complete binary computations on these systems are encouraged to unveil the origin of the three persistent sources.
As shown in Fig. 4, different channels for the formation of UCXBs predict distinct masstransfer rates on the declining stage owing to the different degeneracy of the mass-donors; the mass-donors with lower degeneracy correspond to higher mass-transfer rates on the declining stage. Thus, we emphasize that the relation in the diagram between the masstransfer rate on the declining stage and the orbital period can be used to distinguish the mass-donors in UCXBs. Meanwhile, different formation channels of UCXBs have different mass-donor chemical compositions, which can be used to provide support for the massdonor identifications (e.g. Koliopanos et al. 2021). Hence, more observations on the chemical compositions of the mass-donors in UCXBs are needed.
For the three formation channels of UCXBs, the total UCXB lifetime is mainly determined by the initial orbital periods of pre-UCXB systems. If we set the critical orbital period of UCXBs to be 1 hour, the total UCXB lifetime is about 2 - 4 Gyr; we found that the total UCXB lifetime is no big difference for the three channels (see also Tauris 2018; paper I). In addition, persistent UCXBs from the He star donor channel have lifetimes of 40 - 80 Myr, which are shorter than those from the MS donor channel (50 - 150 Myr; see paper I), but longer than those from the He WD donor channel (20 - 40 Myr; e.g. Tauris 2018). Furthermore, compared with the WD/MS donor channels, the He star donor channel has higher possibility to form single millisecond radio pulsars in the Hubble time as their typical delay times are shorter than those from the WD/MS donor channels.
In the present work, the He star donors can decrease their masses to  0.005 M when the binary evolution terminates because of hitting EOS limits. Ruderman & Shaham (1985) suggested that NSs will tidally disrupt the very low-mass He degenerate donors before they decrease to 0.004 M as the mass-donors change their mass-radius relation, eventually forming single millisecond pulsars. We also note that the NS+He star systems have the potential possibilities to leave behind pulsar+planet-like systems at the end of their evolution (e.g. Podsiadlowski 1993). Pulsar timing observations have revealed three pulsar+planet-like systems so far, in which all planet-like objects are around old millisecond pulsars (e.g. Martin, Livio & Palaniswamy 2016). Especially, Bailes et al. (2011) reported a planet-like object around the millisecond pulsar PSR J1719-1438, and suggested that this system may have once been an UCXB, in which the mass-donor narrowly avoided complete destruction (see also van Haaften et al. 2012b).
In addition, UCXBs are important continuous GW sources in the low-frequency region for LISA, Taiji and TianQin. Some recent studies carried out systematic studies on the detectability of UCXBs by the LISA through the WD/MS donor channels, and suggested that several hundred UCXB-LISA sources would be detected in the Galaxy (see Tauris 2018; paper I). In the present work, the preceding detached NS+He star systems can be detected by the GW observatories owing to the short initial orbital periods (see Fig. 7), and they would be also observable as binary radio pulsars before the mass-transfer process.3 Meanwhile, the preceding detached NS+He star systems could be detectable optically as He stars are relatively luminous objects. We estimate that there exist about 100 - 390
3 Actually, NSs with an ellipticity are also possible to appear as high-frequency GW sources, i.e. the detached NS+He star systems have an opportunity to become dual-line GW sources (see Tauris 2018; Chen 2021).

16 Wang et al.
UCXB-LISA sources through the He star donor channel in the Galaxy. By considering the contribution of the WD/MS donor channels (e.g. Tauris 2018; paper I), the He star donor channel approximately accounts for one third of UCXBs theoretically on the basis of the present work. This indicates that we cannot ignore the contribution of the He star donor channel in forming UCXBs. We note that an accretion-induced collapse of ONe WDs can also produce NS systems, likely contributing to the formation of UCXBs (for a recent review see Wang & Liu 2020; see also Ablimit & Li 2015; Ablimit 2019).
Aside from the contribution to the formation of UCXBs, NS+He star systems also produce intermediate-mass binary pulsars (IMBPs). Chen & Liu (2013) studied NS+He star systems to form IMBPs with short orbital periods (< 3 d), in which a He star transfers its material onto the surface of a NS when the He star evolves to the subgiant stage, resulting in a recycling process for the NS. Tang, Liu & Wang (2019) recently found that the NS+He star systems can reproduce the observed parameters of PSR J0621+1002 that is one of the well-observed IMBPs. We suggest that some IMBPs with relatively short orbital periods may also evolve through UCXB phase once the secondary (CO WD) fills its Roche-lobe in the Hubble time due to the rapid orbital shrinkage resulting from GW radiation. In addition, Shao, Li & Dai (2019) suggested that NS+He star systems can significantly contribute to the population of ultraluminous X-ray sources if the NS accretes He-rich material with a super-M Edd (see also Abdusalam et al. 2020). Furthermore, Ma et al. (2020) recently studied type I X-ray bursts from NSs that accrete He-rich matter, resulting in intermediate X-ray bursts in observations. Compared with normal X-ray bursts, Ma et al. (2020) found that the intermediate X-ray bursts have longer recurrence time and higher luminosity.
6 SUMMARY
The origin of UCXBs is still highly uncertain. In the present work, by combining detailed stellar evolution calculations and BPS approach, we simulated the formation and evolution of UCXBs through the He star donor channel in a systematic way. We firstly explored the parameter spaces for producing UCXBs in the orbital period­secondary mass plane using detailed binary evolution calculations, and then we used these results to carry out a series of Monte Carlo BPS simulations.
The main conclusions are summarized as follows: (1) We found that all NS+He MS star systems for producing UCXBs can be visible as the LISA sources within a distance of 15 kpc. We estimate the rates of UCXB-LISA sources in the Galaxy  3.1 - 11.9 × 10-6yr-1, and the number of UCXB-LISA sources can reach about 100 - 390 in the Galaxy. The present study may overestimate the rates of UCXB-LISA sources, and thus obtained an upper limit of their number in the Galaxy, mainly resulting from some uncertainties in our BPS simulations. (2) The evolutionary tracks of UCXBs through the He star donor channel are able to explain the location of the five transient sources with relatively long orbital periods quite well, especially for Swift J1756.9-2508. (3) We found that the relation in a diagram between the mass-transfer rate on the descending stage and the orbital period can be used to distinguish different channels for the formation of UCXBs. (4) The NS+He MS star systems appear to be UCXBs with lifetime about 1.5 - 4.0 Gyr, in which they show as persistent sources about 40 - 80 Myr. (5) The preceding detached NS+He MS star systems forming UCXBs, can be detected by the GW observatories and would be also observable as binary radio pulsars. After the He MS stars fill their Roche-lobe, the binaries appear to be UCXBs and GW sources simultaneously, eventually producing single millisecond radio pulsars or pulsar+planet-like systems. More theoretical and observational investigations on UCXBs would be helpful for our understanding of this kind of ultra-compact binaries.
