## Abstract

We show that every one-harmonic map, in the sense of Trapani and Valli, from a Hadamard surface of pinched negative curvature to $\mathbb{H}^2$ has image the interior of the convex hull of a subset of $\partial_\infty\mathbb{H}^2$. The proof relies on Minkowski geometry, by interpreting one-harmonic maps as the Gauss maps of convex surfaces.
