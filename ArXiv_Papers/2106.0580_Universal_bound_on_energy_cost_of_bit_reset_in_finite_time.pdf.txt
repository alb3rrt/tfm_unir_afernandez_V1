We consider how the energy cost of bit reset scales with the time duration of the protocol. Bit reset necessarily takes place in finite time, where there is an extra penalty on top of the quasistatic work cost derived by Landauer. This extra energy is dissipated as heat in the computer, inducing a fundamental limit on the speed of irreversible computers. We formulate a hardware-independent expression for this limit. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the work penalty as a function of the time taken for the protocol and bit reset error. It holds for discrete as well as continuous systems, assuming only that the master equation respects detailed balance.

Bit reset, the setting of an unknown bit to a fixed value, is an elementary operation in irreversible computation. Landauer's principle states that bit reset must cost at least kBT ln 2 amount of energy, where kB is Boltzmann's constant and T the temperature of the ambient environment, i.e. the computer [1­3]. The energy cost of binary transistor switching is extrapolated to reach this Landauer's limit around 2035 [4]. This cost is a crucial concern: in the next ten years digital information processors are expected to consume 1/5 of the world's electricity [5]. Moreover, the energy expended is dissipated as heat into the computer and computers are already speed-constrained by power dissipation tolerance limits, posing a key problem in continuing Moore's law indefinitely [6]. Apart from this technological importance, Landauer's limit is also a focal point concerning the role of information in thermodynamics [7­10].
To achieve the kBT ln 2 limit, quasistatic protocols are required and often assumed possible [7, 8, 10]. However, real-life bit reset [11­16] takes place in finite time. This necessitates a possibly dramatically higher work cost than kT ln 2: there is a finite-time work penalty to bit reset. Understanding this penalty is crucial to the energy efficiency of computers in the approaching Landauer's limit of irreversible computing. Generally, the scaling of power dissipation with the reset time  has been argued to be inversely linear in the long-time limit for any stochastic process [17], matching theoretical [18, 19] and experimental results on the mesoscopic system immersed in a double-well potential [11, 13]. For this model, substantial results recently show that the work penalty of an optimal reset protocol scales as 1/ for scenarios such as vanishing reset error [20] or local equilibrium [21]. Meanwhile, a theoretical model based on a qubit reset indicates a more benign scaling [22]. The tension between these results as well as the multitude of possible hardware implementations of bits, including colloidal systems and fluctuating RC circuits [19, 22­27], motivates a search for a universal Landauer's principle

that holds in finite time regardless of the physical implementation and provide a guide to novel hardware beyond CMOS technology [28].

FIG. 1. Our analysis applies to a wide range of bit-reset scenarios, including: a) a double-well potential V (x, t) which is gradually turned into a single well, b) a system with two energy levels where one level is lifted gradually. c) During the finite-time bit-reset, the system state p(t) lags behind the thermal state (t), and we will show that two distances are closely related to the minimal work cost.

In this Letter, we analytically derive a universal lower bound for the finite-time work penalty in bit reset. The bound applies to all physical models as long as detailed balance is respected, and thus encompasses previous results focused on specific models such as those depicted in Fig.1(a) and (b). The bound also holds for both the total time region and the finite bit reset error, and can thus be viewed as a refined Landauer's principle, for finite as well as infinite time. The proof of the bound implies that the work penalty is optimized if one adopts a truly two-level system, such as a spin. We further apply the bound to induce an upper limit on the information throughput of irreversible computers. Our results will aid

nano-electronics research on alternative hardware and to extend information thermodynamics to finite time nonequilibrium regimes.
Nonequilibrium thermodynamics --We briefly introduce common definitions for stochastic thermodynamics using discrete states, though the results straightforwardly apply in the continuous case [29, 30]. Denote the state of a physical system by i  {1, 2, . . . , N } with an associated energy Ei. We use p(t) = [p1(t), . . . , pN (t)] as the distribution of system states at time t. A key assumption is that when the system is in contact with a heat bath at temperature T , this distribution undergoes a stochastic evolution towards the thermal state , wherein i = e-Ei /Z with  = 1/kBT and the partition function Z = i e-Ei . The evolution is modelled by a Markovian master equation

d dt

ij (t) pj(t).

(1)

j

Here, ij(t) is the transition rate from state j to state i which satisfies ij(t) 0 for all i = j and i ij(t) = 0 for any j due to conservation of probability. We also

assume detailed balance ij(t)j(t) = ji(t)i(t) for all

i = j, which is a common condition satisfied by a wide

class of nonequilibrium processes [31].

The system is also allowed to interact with a work

reservoir, which `drives' the system [32]. Then, any

change in internal energy U = i piEi is associated with work (due to the work reservoir) and heat (due to the

heat bath), i.e. dU = i Eidpi + i pidEi = dQ + dW .

For a process taking time  , the heat exchanged and work

input are then Q( ) =

Q dt

and

W ( )

re-

spectively. When the driving is very slow, the system

remains in the instantaneous thermal state at all times.

Such a process is called quasistatic with associated work

Wqs( ) [33]. However, quasistatic protocols strictly re-

quire infinite time, whereas in realistic situations, pro-

tocols are applied in finite time, implying an additional

work cost defined as the work penalty

Wpn ( ) = W ( ) - Wqs( ).

(2)

For nonequilibrium thermodynamics, there is an additional (non-negative) entropic contribution termed the entropy production [29, 30], i.e. ( ) = S ( ) - Q( )/T 0, where S( ) = S( ) - S(0) is the change of thermodynamic entropy S = -kB i pi ln pi. It is often convenient to use the non-negative entropy production rate

where we have substituted detailed balance. Generic bit reset--We now model the bit reset process
with stochastic thermodynamics. The bit is associated with two logical states "0" and "1". The bit is reset (or `erased') if it is set to "0" regardless of the initial state.

It is normally assumed that either logical state is initially equally likely. As can be seen from Fig.1(a), logical states may be associated with sets of underlying microstates, 0 and 1 such that

Pabit (t) =

pi (t) ,

a  {0, 1} .

(4)

ia

Eq.(4) defines the coarse-grained [34] bit distribution P bit(t). The coarse-grained thermal state can be similarly defined as bit with abit = ia i for a  {0, 1}.
By employing interactions with a heat bath and with
a work reservoir [35], a reset protocol monotonically increases the energy differences between {Ei|i  0} and {Ej|j  1}, while the system undergoes thermalisation. As depicted in Fig.1(a and b), P1bit decreases leading to a final distribution P bit( ) = [1 - , ], where = P1bit( ) is the reset error.
Landauer's limit states that the minimal work cost for such a protocol (with  0) is Wqs = kBT ln 2. This can be shown to follow from the non-negativity of en-
tropy production (c.f. Eq.(6) below). We now proceed
to bound the work penalty for finite time and nonvanish-
ing reset error.
Main Result: Bound on work penalty--For any bit
reset protocols within the framework described above,

Wpn( )

(5)

Here, D ( ) = D[P bit( ) bit( )] is the relative entropy between the coarse-grained bit state with coarse-grained thermal state at the final time. The reset error = P1bit( ) can be demanded as a boundary condition or it can be treated as a parameter that depends on µ  for allowed maximal energies. µ  is a measure of how strong the thermalisation is.
The proof has three steps (see Appendix A for details). Step I: Work penalty from relative entropy--For the (fine-grained) physical systems, the work penalty of any finite-time protocol can be expressed as

Wpn ( ) = kBT D [p ] + T  ( ) ,

(6)

where D[p ] = D[p( ) ( )] - D[p(0) (0)] is the change of relative entropy D[p ] = i pi ln (pi/i) (see e.g. Ref. [36]). This can be understood from the perspective of information geometry [37, 38]. As p(t) always chases after (t) due to thermalisation (see Fig.1c), we examine the rate of change in `distance' between them:

D [p(t) (t)] = ppD [p ] +  D [p ] , (7)

where ppD[p ] = i pipi D[p ] and  D[p ] = i ii D[p ]. As proved in Appendix A 1, the first
term is identical to entropy production rate  up to
a factor -kB, while the second term is exactly the
time derivative of Wpn. By integrating the equation D [p ] = - /kB + W pn, Eq.(6) is obtained.

3

Step 2: Coarse-graining relative entropy, entropy pro-
duction and dynamics--The underlying state and dynamics induce corresponding coarse-grained states and dynamics, as described above. For general bit reset protocols, the system is initially in a thermal state such that D[p ] = D[p( ) ( )] in Eq.(6). We first show that D[p( ) ( )] can be lower bounded by its coarse-grained counterpart (see Appendix A 2 b for details),

D [p ( )  ( )] D P bit ( ) bit ( )  D ( ) . (8)

To lower bound entropy production we require the coarse-grained dynamics. As a hidden-Markov model with the underlying dynamics described by Eq.(1), the coarse-grained dynamics can be described by the master equation Pabit(t) = a baait(t)Pabit(t) for a  {0, 1}, with a transition rate baait(t) [34] that depends on the underlying microstates, which in turn are uniquely determined by the initial microstate for the given dynamics. As shown in Appendix A 2, we can associate a coarsegrained entropy production rate, in a similar form with Eq.(3), that

with the coarse-grained system. Note that  bit is
experimentally accessible via measuring aa following the coarse-grained trajectories [11]. We prove in Appendix A 2 b that this bit( ) is a lower bound to the
exact ( ) of the system, i.e.

 ( ) bit ( ) .

(10)

Then, combining Eqs. (6), (8) and (10), the work penalty of bit reset is always lower bounded by

Wpn( ) D P bit ( ) bit ( ) + bit ( ) .

(11)

We show in Appendix A 3 that the bound in Eq.(11) is tight at least in the case of local equilibrium (a case studied e.g. in [34]), wherein the probabilities of microstates conditional on the bit value equal those of a thermal state. As local equilibrium reduces the work-penalty, this also strongly suggests that two-level systems outperform multi-level systems in terms of work penalty in general. We have also not allowed for the qubit to have quantum coherence here; there are reasons to think it does not help in bit reset protocols [22].
Step 3: Entropy production time-scaling via speed-
limit--We firstly turn our attention to the  -dependence of the second term of Eq.(11) by extending the recently discovered classical speed limit [39] approach to the coarse-grained case. Speed limits were first proposed to operationalize the time-energy uncertainty relation [40] and since then have found utility in many facets of quantum and classical physics [41­51]. In essence, the changes to the state of a system must occur in finite time, which depends on the distance between the initial and the final states and the speed, i.e., the system's energetics [52].

We show that the coarse-grained master equation can always be mapped to a partial swap model P bit(t) = µ(t)(P bit(t)-P st(t)), with a parameter µ(t) = a baait(t) describing the swap rate during relaxation and P st(t) the coarse-grained stationary state [53]. (See Appendix A 4.)
Using this model, in Appendix A 5 we prove the speed limit for the coarse-grained system,

rate, and L[P bit( ), P bit(0)] = a Pabit( ) - Pabit(0)

is the 1-norm distance. The `speed' here is thus

µ  bit( ).

Finally, using Eqs. (11) and (12) while substituting the

initial condition P bit(0) = [1/2, 1/2] and final condition

P bit( ) = [1 - , ] for a generic bit reset protocol, the

penalty bound Eq.(5) is deduced.

Relative entropy time-scaling--The relative entropy

D ( ) can be lower bounded after we solve the partial

swap model (as shown in Appendix B). It turns out

that D ( ) may decay much faster than bit( ). Par-

ticularly, for small enough time  , the decay of D ( )

can never escape an exponential scaling characterized by

e- µ   . If one further assumes the coarse-grained sta-

tionary state is exactly bit, we can show a lower bound

D ( ) e- µ   (2e- µ   - 1)D[bit(0) bit( )]. To in-

vestigate whether D ( ) can decay exponentially, as well

as to validate the penalty bound, we study a typical reset

protocol in a two-level system.

Constant-shifting protocol in a two-level system--In a

two-level system, e.g. Fig.1(b), coarse-grained and fine-

grained states coincide. As we have shown in Eq.(11),

a two-level system (e.g. Fig.1b) may optimize the work

penalty. For this system, coarse-grained and fine-grained

states coincide, such that the evolution of the system is described by the partial swap model P (t) = µ((t) -

P (t)), where we have assumed µ(t) = µ for simplicity.

This model is a simplified collisional model for thermali-

sation [22, 54], which has been used to describe relaxation

of nuclear magnetic resonance qubits.

A typical reset protocol is shifting one energy level at a

constant rate, as discussed in [22]. The two energy levels

are both zeros initially, and then the second energy level

is shifted to a maximal energy Emax in N steps: for each

step, E1 is suddenly lifted with an increment Emax/N

and then the system thermalises for a time  /N . Phys-

ically, this assumes the experimentalist can change the

control fields significantly faster than the thermalisation

rate. We prove that D ( ) in Eq.(5) must have an expo-

nential scaling (see Appendix C 2 for the proof),

D ( ) e-µ/N D [(0) ( )] .

(13)

Fig.2 gives numerical simulations showing the validity of Eq.(5) and its tightness. Two qualitatively different cases are examined: that of fixed maximal energy level Emax, and that of fixed reset error . For both cases, the

bound in Eq.(5) restricts the work penalty closely and the bound becomes tighter as the finite time gets longer. The relative entropy and entropy production are upper and lower bounded by their bounds in Eq.(13) and Eq.(12), respectively. We can observe two time regimes: for short times D ( ) dominates and Wpn( ) decays exponentially, and for long times ( ) dominates such that Wpn( ) cannot escape an inverse linear scaling. As we prove in Appendix C 4, the work penalty itself can be upper bounded by an exponentially decaying function which converges to a positive value. Therefore an exponential decay of the work-penalty (in  ) can in certain regimes dominate the known inverse linear scaling.
To see whether regimes of two time scaling always exist, in Fig.3 we show the performance of the protocol in the entire region of Emax and . Despite the region where the protocol fails (region III), i.e. where < 1(Emax), the work penalty (finite time) increases (decreases) as both Emax and grows. Roughly speaking, when is large, one can always set Emax such that Wpn is in an exponential scaling (Region I); while when is small, Wpn is mainly in the inverse linear scaling (Region II).
Application to a mesoscopic system within a double-
well potential--Another typical model to discuss bit reset is a double-well potential (Fig.1a) with overdamped Langevin dynamics. It describes a large class of mesoscopic systems such as a driven particle that also receives random forces from the environment [2, 3, 18­ 21]. Since the underlying Langevin process is Markovian and respects detailed balance, our bound also applies. In particular, our results can recover the time scalings discussed in important works [20, 21]. When the error vanishes, i.e.  0, D ( ) vanishes as a consequence of P1bit( ), 1bit( )  0, so penalty bound is reduced to Wpn( ) (1 - )2/ µ   showing a 1/ scaling [20]. When assuming local equilibrium, as proved in Appendix A 3, the coarse-grained bit is effectively reduced to a two-level system which we have studied, and the entropy production also shows a 1/ scaling [20]. Beyond the above two cases, our results are not restricted to Langevin dynamics, apply to both discrete and con-

tinuous systems and simplify the derivation of a closed form bound to the question of finding µ  , which can either be experimentally measured via testing trajectories, or analytically calculated as shown in Appendix D 1.
Implied bound on information throughput--As hardware can handle only limited temperatures and the work applied for each reset is dissipated as heat [4], the power dissipation places a limit on how many resets can be done per unit of time and space. Using the notation of [55], for a device switching time SW, integration density (number of binary switches per cm2 ) n, the information throughput B = n/SW is restricted by the ratio of binary transition energy Ebit and power dissipation growth P = EbitB. As our results concern the minimal work cost of finite-time bit reset in generic hardwares, it leads to a refined restriction on the power dissipation growth, i.e. P kBT [ln 2 - Hb( ) + Emax + (1 - 2 )2/(µSW)]/SW, where Hb( ) = - ln -(1- ) ln(1- ) is the binary thermodynamic entropy (see Appendix E for derivation).
Summary and outlook-- Landauer's principle implies a limit on the information throughput of irreversible computers as real hardware has finite power dissipation tolerance. Here, we derive a universal version of the finitetime Landauer's principle that applies to any hardware implementation of the bit. It has been verified with energetic constraints and finite bit reset error thresholds. It would be interesting to ask if finite-time Landauer's principle can be extended beyond the detailed balance and into single-shot regime, i.e. statements about the work cost that hold in every single shot of an experiment.

mal state fixed, where either needs to be supplemented

with the possibility to introducing work into the system

(A1)

here we show that the two parts in its time derivative

D [p ] = ppD [p ] +  D [p ]

correspond to entropy production rate and work penalty rate, respectively.
For the first term,

ppD [p ] = pipi D [p ]

where we have used the thermal state expression i =

For the second term, recall that Wpn = W -

(A13)

Substituting Eqs. (A8) and (A13) into Eq. (A2), we obtain

D [p ] = -kB-1 + W pn.

(A14)

The integration over time  yields

Wpn ( ) = kBT D [p ] + T  ( ) , with D[p ] = D[p( ) ( )] - D[p(0) (0)].

(A15)

7

Generalization to continuous case Making the physically justified assumptions that both p and  are in Schwartz' space (that is, the probabilities are reasonably well localised) and that  has full support (the energy does not diverge), one directly sees that simply replacing the sum by the corresponding integral will give the same result for the continuous case. Of course there are wellmotivated, but strictly speaking unphysical, models that do not follow the above assumptions and more care must be taken in those cases. For instance, if the energy does diverge in some volume in space at some time, then p needs to go to zero there before that happens, since otherwise the model introduces infinite work on the system. See Ref.[29] for details.

2. Step 2: Coarse-graining relative entropy, entropy production and dynamics

We apply the coarse-graining to a generic system to
create a bit. Precisely, if the system is observed in one of states in 0 = {i1, i2, . . . , in}, we say the bit is in logical state 0; otherwise, if the system is in 1 = {j1, j2, . . . , jm}, we say the bit is in logical state 1. For the bit to be logical, 0 and 1 must be disjoint and complementary. Then, the distribution of bit states is denoted by P bit = [P0bit, P1bit] with

Pa = pi, a  {0, 1} .

(A16)

The master equation of coarse-grained states can be written as [34]

b. Entropy production

From the master equation

pi =

j(=i)

(A23)

where ij are transition rates satisfying ij 0 for i = j and i ij = 0 for all j, the entropy production has a rate

Here, we have used the thermal state expression i = exp-Ei /Z in the third line and the detailed balance
condition ijj = jii in the last line.

Here,

baait

(A33)

are transition rates between coarse-grained states, i.e. bit states 0 and 1.
With the coarse-grained transition rates, we can define the coarse-grained entropy production as a similar form of Eq. (A28), i.e.

 bit

baaitPabit - baaitPabit

ln

baaitPabit baaitPabit

.

(A34)

Now we show that  bit by proving   bit 0.
In Eq. (A28), we can always drop the terms in the sum with i, j in the same a. This is due to the fact that ijpj 0 i = j and therefore (ijpj -

8

jipi) ln(ijpj/jipi) 0. Then, using the log sum inequality again, we have

(A38) (A39)

Note that   bit 0, as each term in the sum is non-negative due to the relation (u - v) log(u/v) 0 for u, v > 0. This also recovers the second law as it shows that the entropy production and its rate is non-negative. In the bit reset case, since (0) = bit(0) = 0 at the beginning, we finally obtain

( ) bit( ),

(A40)

i.e., the coarse-grained entropy production is lower than the fine-grained one.

3. Effective two-level system in local equilibrium

We show that by assuming the local equilibrium, the coarse-grained master equation respects detailed balance, such that the coarse-grained bit is reduced to an effective two-level system. The local equilibrium assumption can be written as

pi i

=

pj j

(A41)

whenever i and j are in the same composite bit. Calling
0 the first bit and 1 the second, this is the case if either i, j  0 or i, j  1. For this special case of local equilibrium, we have a very simple formula for the thermal state bit of the coarse grained bits, namely

abit :=

i.

ia

(A42)

For the thermal state, we need to have that it is stationary under the (undriven) master equation, such that

 t

0bit

=

0.

(A43)

As the coarse grained system only has two levels, this is also the only condition (unless the dynamics is trivial).

Using the very useful property that

Pabit abit

=

ia pi = ia i

ia

pk k

i

=

(A44)

for any k  a, we get indeed

(A45)

as the i are the stationary components of the fine grained thermal state. This also means that the abit satisfy the equilibrium condition

0bit

=

b01it b01it - b00it

.

(A46)

With this in mind we can directly see that the coarse grained entropy production is the same as the fine grained one. We start with the observation that

ln

b10itP0 b01itP1

=

ln

P0(10 - b01it

(A48)

and, from Eq. (A32), we have that

Pa = baaitPa - baaitPa = -Pa.

(A49)

It follows that

where the first line is the definition, in the second line we used Eq. (A47) and (A49), in the third line we used linearity of the derivative and Eq. (A44).
As for the relative entropy, let

pi i

=

ca,

i  a.

(A55)

We can compare

D [p ] =

(A58)

= D [p ] .

(A59)

Therefore, for the system satisfying local equilibrium, we can prove that

Wpn = D ( ) + bit

(A60)

such that the penalty inequality is saturated.

4. Partial swap model

When the system is coarse-grained to a bit system, the
dynamics of the bit can always be described by the partial
swap model. To see this, we introduce a coarse-grained stationary state P st such that

and let

b01itP1st = b10itP0st,

(A61)

µ = b01it + b10it.

(A62)

Then, we have b01it = µP0st and b10it = µP1st. Substitute it into Eq. (A32) and we have

P0bit = µP0stP1bit - µP1stP0bit = µ P0st - P0bit

(A63)

P1 = µP1stP0bit - µP0stP1bit = µ P1st - P1bit . (A64)

Finally, Eq. (A32) can be equivalently written as

P = µ P st - P bit .

(A65)

To see the meaning of partial swap, consider an infinitesimal time dt. A state P bit(t) evolves to P bit(t + dt) = (1 - µ(t)dt)P bit(t) + µ(t)dtP st(t). That is, P bit(t + dt) is obtained by swapping the state P bit(t) with the stationary state P st at a probability µ(t)dt. Therefore, µ(t) is
called the partial swap rate.

5. Step 3: Entropy production time-scaling via speed

Here, we prove the entropy production lower bound via the speed limit on the partial swap model.
Take Eq. (A65) into Eq. (A34), we have the coarsegrained entropy production rate

Appendix B: Time-scaling of relative entropy
As the partial swap model in Eq. (A65) is a first-order partial differential equation, we have a solution P bit (t) =

10

P0bit (t) , P1bit (t) with
t
P1bit (t) = e- µ tt P1bit (0) + ds e µ ssµ (s) P1st (s) .

(B1) During the bit reset, P1st (s) P1st (t) for any two times s t. Then, P1bit (t) can be lower bounded by

inequality holds,
D [p q] D [x q] + (1 - ) D [y q] + 2 -  (D [x y] + D [y x]) .

(B4)

Proof. Note that D [p q] is monotonicly increasing with
p1. This can be checked by deriving p1 D [p q] and considering its boundaries q1 p1 1/2. Then, let  = 1-
and we have

To

bound D P bit bit , we need to know how D P bit bit

varies with P1bit. We prove the following relation.

Proposition. For three binary distributions p = [p0, p1], x = [x0, x1] and y = [y0, y1], if p0 p1 and p1 x1 + (1 - ) y1 holds for some   [0, 1], then, for another binary distribution q = [q0, q1] with q1 p1,the following

- D [y x + y] + D [y q]

D [x q] + D [y q]

-  (D [x y] + D [y x]) .

In the last inequality, we have used the convexity of relative entropy. [QED.]
Now, substitute Eq. (B3) into Eq. (B4), we have

D ( ) =D P bit ( ) bit ( ) e- µ   D 1bit (0) bit ( ) + 1 - e- µ   D P st ( ) bit ( ) - e- µ   1 - e- µ   D bit (0) P st ( ) + D P st ( ) bit (0) .

(B5)

We have the following cases:

· Case 1: for small enough time  such that 1 - e- µ   almost vanishes, up to the first order of 1 - e- µ   , we have

D ( ) e- µ   D bit (0) bit ( )

- 1 - e- µ   D bit (0) P st ( )

2

+ O 1 - e- µ  

.

(B6)

As in this case 1  e- µ   1 - e- µ   , D ( ) is mainly in an exponential scaling.

· Case 2: if P st ( ) = bit ( ), we have

D ( ) e-2 µ   J bit (0) , bit ( ) - e- µ   D bit ( ) bit (0)

(B7)

e- µ   2e- µ   - 1 D bit (0) bit ( ) (B8)

where J [p, q] = D [p q] + D [q p] is the symmetric relative entropy, and in the last inequality we used D[p q] D[q p] for two binary distribution with 1/2 p1 q1.
To show this, one can consider a function g (p1) = D [p q] - D [q p] and check its derivatives on p1. It yields p1 g 0 and p21 g 0 for q1 p1 1/2. Thus, g (p1) 0 leads to D [p q] D [q p].

Appendix C: Constant-shifting protocol on a two-level system

As described in the main text, the constant-shifting protocol has N steps. Initially, E0(0) = E1(0) = 0 and P0(0) = P1(0) = 1/2. Then, E0(t) = 0 is fixed during a finite time  , while at t = (k - 1) /N for each k = 1, 2, . . . , N , the energy E1 is instantly lifted with an increment Emax/N . The system undergoes a thermalisation in the following  =  /N time. At the k-th step, the energy E1 is denoted by E1k, the thermal state is denoted byk, and the system state is denoted by P k.
We have shown that the relative entropy change is equivalent to the sum of work penalty and the negative entropy production. Thus, for each energy lift step, entropy production is zero and relative entropy change is exactly work penalty, while for each thermalisation step, work penalty is zero and relative entropy change is exactly the negative entropy production. To summarize, the entire entropy production is

1. Relative entropy production bound with a fixed thermal state

We first look at the partial swap model p = µ ( - p) with a time-independent . This corresponds to each thermalsation step. The p(t) can be solved as

p (t) = e-µtp (0) + 1 - e-µt .

(C4)

Using the convexity of relative entropy, we have

D[p(t) ] e-µtD[p(0) ]

(C5)

For the later use, we also derive a lower bound on D[p(t) ]. We check the time derivative of D [p ]

(C7)

2. Upper bound of relative entropy

Let q = e-µ/N .

(C8)

The D( ) in the constant-shifting protocol can be upper bounded by

3. Exponential scaling of the relative entropy for fixed error
The Eq. (C10) shows that D( ) of the constantshifting protocol is exponentially decaying up to a factor D[(0) ( )]. This factor is a constant for the case of fixed energy. Here, we also show that for the case of fixed error, although ( ) is changing for different  , still D( ) decays exponentially.
Consider a protocol where the reset error is fixed. This means that for different times the final energy of the state is dependent on the total time  of the protocol. Let Emax(1) be the final energy for the protocol with length  and error . We have shown that for the same upper energy at longer total times the relative entropy term decays exponentially. As the protocol is longer, additionally, the final state will be nearer to the thermal state (that keeps fixed, as it only depends on the final

12

energy). The final error will thus be smaller than for that protocol. This means that, if instead of the energy, we keep the final error fixed, we can drive the energy of the level to be set to zero slower, which will, at any time of the protocol with fixed error, drive the thermal state slower to the reset state, in comparison to the case of the protocol with fixed final energy. It then directly follows that for the protocol with fixed error 1 the final thermal state for any length of the protocol 2 > 1 will be farther away of the reset state, than for the protocol with fixed maximal energy Emax, while the final state will obviously be the same (as the error is fixed). This means that the final state will be nearer (by any distance measure) to the final thermal state. Concluding, we find that the decay of the relative entropy term needs to be at least as fast in the case of protocols with fixed error as in the case of protocols with fixed final energy, where it is exponential; which yields the claim.

4. Exponential dacay of work penalty

Appendix D: Overdamped Fokker-Plank equation with a double-well potential

1. The partial swap rate of Fokker-Plank equation

The dynamics of a Brownian particle in a double-well potential can be described by the Fokker-Planck equation

tp (x, t) = Dx [xV (x, t) + x] p (x, t) . (D1)

where p(x, t) is the distribution of the Brownian particle

position at time t, D is the diffusion constant, and V (x, t)

is the double-well potential. Compared with the discrete

case, the position x casts as the continuous states label

and the potential V (x, t) the internal energies. There-

fore, by writing

i pifi as

+ -

dxp(x)f (x),

where

f

can

be internal energies (potentials) or stochastic entropies,

we generalize the definitions in the discrete case to the

continuous. For instance, for V (x, t) at time t, the cor-

responding thermal distribution is

 (x, t)

=

e-V (x,t) Z

,

+

Z (t) =

dxe-V (x,t). (D2)

-

Then, it can be verified that the work penalty relation

Wpn ( ) = W ( ) - Wpn = T D [p ] + T  ( ) ,

(D3) (D4)

naturally holds. To perform the coarse-graining analysis, it is necessary
to write the Fokker-Planck equation in the form of continuous master equation

tp (x, t) = dx  (x|x ; t) p (x , t) .
R

(D5)

Here, (x|x ; t) is the transition rate from x to x. It satisfies (x|x ; t) 0 x = x , t and dx(x|x ; t) = 0 t. To write the differential form of Eq. (D1) to the integral form of Eq. (D5), we consider a small time interval

t = t - t .

(D6)

Because the evolution is Markovian, the distribution p(x, t) can be viewed as a one-dimensional random walk from p(x, t ),

p (x, t) = dx P [x, t|x , t ] p (x , t ) ,
R

(D7)

where P [x, t|x , t ] is the jump probability from position x at time t to position x at time t. Then, we can approximate tp(x, t) via the left derivative

p

(x,

t)

-p t

(x,

t

)

=

1 t

dx (P [x, t|x , t ] - xx ) p (x , t ) .
R

(D8)

Compared with Eq. (D5), we can approximate (x|x ; t)

by

 (x|x

; t)

=

lim
t0

P

[x, t|x , t t

]

- xx

.

(D9)

Here we assume that the above limitation is well-defined. It this is not the case, we could always use P [x, t|x , t ] of small time t to evaluate (x|x ; t).
From the Fokker-Planck equation in Eq. (D1), P [x, t|x , t ] can be solved as

P [x, t|x , t ] =  1

e . -

(x+Dx V (x
4Dt

,t

)t)2

4Dt

(D10)

Upon Eq. (D9), we can verify that the detailed balanced condition holds, i.e.

 (x|x ; t)  (x , t) =  (x |x; t)  (x, t) .

(D11)

This allows us to apply the coarse-grained entropy production in Eq. (A34) as a lower bound of the actual entropy production, as shown in Eq. (A40). Here, the coarse-grained states are

P0 (t) = P1 (t) =

0
dxp (x, t) ,
-
+
dxp (x, t) .
0

(D12) (D13)

That is, when using the Brownian particle in double-well potential as a bit, we choose position in the left well as bit value 0 while position in the right well as bit value 1.

The dynamics can also be described by the partial swap
model as in Eq. (A65). Particularly, the partial swap rate µ = b01it + b10it can be well estimated.
