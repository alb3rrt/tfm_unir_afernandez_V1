## Abstract

In the context of the Standard Model effective field theory we derive direct and indirect bounds on chromodipole operators involving the bottom and charm quark. We find that the experimental upper limit on the neutron electric dipole moment puts severe constraints on the imaginary parts of the Wilson coefficients of both chromodipole operators. The magnitudes of the Wilson coefficients are instead only weakly constrained by dijet searches and Z-boson production in association with bottom-quark jets. Flavour physics does not provide meaningful bounds. The implications of our findings for explicit models of new physics are also briefly discussed.
