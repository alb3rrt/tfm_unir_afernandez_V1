STANLEY-REISNER'S RING AND THE OCCURRENCE OF THE STEINBERG REPRESENTATION IN THE HIT PROBLEM
NGUYEN DANG HO HAI
Abstract. G. Walker and R. Wood proved that in degree 2n - 1 - n, the space of indecomposable elements of F2[x1, . . . , xn], considered as a module over the mod 2 Steenrod algebra, is isomorphic to the Steinberg representation of GLn(F2). We generalize this result to all finite fields by analyzing certain finite quotients of Fq[x1, . . . , xn] which come from the Stanley-Reisner rings of some matroid complexes. Our method also shows that the space of indecomposable elements in degree qn-1 - n has the dimension equal to that of a complex cuspidal representation of GLn(Fq). As a by product, over the prime field F2, we give a decomposition of the Steinberg summand of one of these quotients into a direct sum of suspensions of Brown-Gitler modules. This decomposition suggests the existence of a stable decomposition derived from the Steinberg module of a certain topological space into a wedge of suspensions of Brown-Gitler spectra.

1. Introduction

Let p be a prime and let Fq denote a finite field of q = ps elements. Let V be an n-dimensional vector space over Fq. The symmetric power algebra S(V ) = k0 Sk(V ) on the dual V  of V is identified with the polynomial algebra Fq[x1, . . . , xn] where {x1, . . . , xn} is a basis of V . We assign to each variable xi degree one, so Sk(V ) has a basis consisting all monomials of degree k.

The Steenrod algebra P generated over Fq by the reduced Steenrod operations Pi, i  0, defined as in [Smi07], acts on S(V ) as follows:

Pk(xm) =

m k

xm+(q-1)k ,

x  S1(V ),

Pk(f g) =

Pi(f )Pj(g), f, g  S(V ).

i+j=k

This action commutes with the action of GLn := GLn(Fq) by linear substitutions of the variables x1, . . . , xn. Given M a P-module, the module of P-indecomposable elements of M is defined by

Q(M ) := M/P+M,

P+ denoting the augmentation ideal of P. The Peterson hit problem in algebraic topology, focused mainly on the finite field F2, asks for a determination of a minimal generating set of the polynomial algebra S(V ) as a module over the Steenrod algebra. This is the same as the problem of determining Q(S(V )) as a
graded vector space, or more generally as a graded module over the group ring Fq[GLn]. Though much work has been done for this problem, the general answer seems to be out of reach with the present techniques.
The reader is referred to the two recent books of G. Walker and R. M. W. Wood [WW18a, WW18b] for a
thorough exposition of this problem.

The starting point of this work is the following result, which is also due to Walker and Wood [WW07]: Theorem 1.1 (Walker-Wood). For q = 2, Q2n-1-n(S(V )) is isomorphic to the Steinberg representation of GLn.

Walker and Wood proved this by establishing a link between the hit problem over F2 and Young

tableaux. They proved that in some generic degree d, the semistandard tableaux can be used to in-

dex a generating set for Qd(S(V )). In degree 2n - 1 - n, the hook formula gives the upper bound

the

Steinberg

module in this degree [MP83, KM86].

The purpose of this paper is to present a new approach to the above result which is valid for all finite fields. The point we discover here is that there is a finite quotient R(V ) of S(V ) such that its top-degree submodule, R(qn-1)/(q-1)-n(V ), is P-indecomposable and isomorphic to the Steinberg module, and that the natural projection Qi(S(V ))  Qi(R(V )) is an isomorphism in the range 0  i  (qn - 1)/(q - 1) - n.
A part from classical tools in studying the hit problem, a novel one which we are going to employ in this
work is the Stanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial complex [Sta96]. We note that our method also leads to a formula for the dimension of Q(S(V )) in degree qn-1 - n and as a by product, for q = 2, we obtain a decomposition of the Steinberg summand of a variant of R(V ) into a direct sum of Brown-Gitler modules
[BG73].

We now describe the main results of the paper. For this let us choose a nonzero vector u on each line

 in V . Given a subspace W of V , "product of all lines" in W . If W  is basis of V  then it is well-known that

denote by LW the set of all lines in W . Put LW a subspace of W , put VW ,W = LW \LW u. If LV  is (up to a nonzero scalar) the polynomial

= LW u, {x1, . . . , xn}

the is a

Ln = L(x1, . . . , xn) := det(xjqi-1 )1i,jn

introduced by Dickson [Dic11]. Similarly, if H is the hyperplane generated by x1, . . . , xn-1 then VH,V  is (up to a nonzero scalar) the polynomial

Vn = V(x1, . . . , xn) :=

(1x1 + · · · + n-1xn-1 + xn)

iFq

introduced by Mu`i [Mui75].

For k  1, let I(V , k) (or In,k) denote the ideal of S(V ) generated by the polynomials VHk ,V , where H runs over the set of all hyperplanes of V . Since GLn acts transitively on the set of hyperplanes of V , it is equivalent to say that I(V , k) is generated by the orbit of Vnk under the action of GLn. Let R(V , k) (or Rn,k) denote the quotient S(V )/I(V , k). It is clear that the natural projection S(V )  R(V , k) is both P-linear and GLn-linear.

The Steinberg representation Stn [Ste56] is a projective absolutely irreducible representation of GLn
n(n-1)
of dimension q 2 . It is isomorphic to the right Fq[GLn]-module en · Fq[GLn] where en is the Steinberg
idempotent defined by

en

1 [GLn :

Un]

bBn ,

n

sgn()b,

Bn, Un, n denoting respectively the subgroup of upper triangular matrices, the subgroup of upper triangular matrices with 1's on the diagonal, and the symmetric group of permutation matrices. Let deti, i  Z, denote the i-th power of the determinant representation of GLn. Then we have deti = detj if i  j mod (q - 1) and det0, . . . , detq-2 form a complete set of distinct one-dimensional representations of GLn over Fq. A twisted Steinberg module is defined to be a tensor product Stn  deti and this is again a
n(n-1)
projective absolutely irreducible representation of GLn of dimension q 2 . The idempotent corresponding to Stn  deti is denoted by en(i) and is given by e(ni) = i(en) where i is the automorphism of Fq[GLn] given by i(g) = deti(g-1)g (see [Mit85, §2]).

Theorem

1.2.

Put

d :=

k(qn-1) q-1

- n.

3
(1) R(V , k) is trivial in degree greater than d, and in this degree, it is isomorphic to the twisted Steinberg module Stn  detk-1.
(2) For k = qsr with 1  r  q - 1, the following hold: (a) For each 0  i  d, the natural projection S(V )  R(V , k) induces an isomorphism of GLn-modules Qi(S(V )) = Qi(R(V , k)). (b) The top-degree module Rd(V , k) is P-indecomposable.

As a consequence, we obtain the following generalization of the above result of Walker and Wood.
Corollary 1.3. For k = qsr with 1  r  q - 1, there is an isomorphism of GLn-modules: Qd(S(V )) = Stn  detk-1.

This is because we have a sequence of isomorphisms GLn-modules: Stn  detk-1 = Rd(V , k) -= Qd(R(V , k)) =- Qd(S(V )),
where the first isomorphism follows from Part (1) of Theorem 1.2 (1), the second from (2.b) and the third from (2.a).

The strategy for the proof of Theorem 1.2(1) is as follows. We consider a simplicial complex (V , k) whose Alexander dual is homotopy equivalent to the Tits building of GLn. The complex (V , k) is a matroid complex and so the Stanley-Reisner ring Fq[(V , k)] is Cohen-Macaulay. The quotient module R(V , k) defined above is then showed to be isomorphic to the quotient of Fq[(V , k)] by the ideal generated by a well-chosen regular sequence of Fq[(V , k)]. The linear structure of R(V , k), in particular of its top-
degree submodule, will follow from some classical results in the theory of Stanley-Reisner rings [Sta96]. In order to prove Theorem 1.2 (2.a), we need to show that all elements of degree  d in the ideal I(V , k) are hit (i.e. P-decomposable) in S(V ). For example, when k = 1, this is proved by using the -trick [Woo89]
and the following identity (Lemma 4.2):

Vn

=

(-1)n-1

n-1
(P

) qn-1 -1 q-1

-i

eixn

,

i=0

where  : P  P is the canonical anti-automorphism, and ei is the i-th elementary symmetric function of x1q-1, . . . , xnq--11. Theorem 1.2 (2.b) will be proved by showing that R(V , k) can be embedded in a direct product of copies of the quotient Fq[x1, . . . , xn]/(xq1n-1k, . . . , xqnk-1, xkn) (which is an example of Poincar´e duality algebras with trivial Wu classes [MS05]).

Our method can also be used to obtain the following: Theorem 1.4. dimFq Qqn-1-n(S(V )) = (q - 1)(q2 - 1) · · · (qn-1 - 1), n  2.

This will be proved by considering a simplicial complex whose Alexander dual is homotopy equivalent to a complex employed by G. Lusztig [Lus74] in his work on constructing discrete series (a.k.a. cuspidal representations) of GLn.
To state the final result of the paper, suppose q = k = 2 and denote by A the mod 2 Steenrod algebra. Using the work of Inoue [Ino02] on the hit problem of the Steinberg summand, we will show that the Steinberg summand of R(V , 2) is decomposed into a direct sum of suspensions of Brown-Gitler modules [BG73].
Theorem 1.5. Put d = 2(2n - 1) - n = nj=1(2j - 1). There is an isomorphism of A-modules n d-(2j-1)B(2j - 1) -= Rn,2 · en.
j=0

4
Here B(k) denotes the Brown-Gitler module B(k) := A/A (Sqi) | 2i > k and Rn,2 · en denotes the direct summand of Rn,2 associated to the Steinberg idempotent en.
In an ongoing project, by using the work [DJ91] of M. W. Davis and T. Januszkiewicz, we interpret R(V , k) as the mod 2 cohomology of the orbit space (V , k)reg/V , where (V , k) denotes the direct sum of k copies of the reduced regular representation of V and (V , k)reg denotes the regular part of the action of V on (V , k). The decomposition in Theorem 1.5 suggests that there would exist a homotopy equivalence (of 2-completed spectra)
n
en · ((V , 2)reg/V )+  d-(2j-1)B(2j - 1),
j=0
B(k) denoting the Brown-Gitler spectrum whose cohomology is B(k). We intend to go back to this problem in a future work.

2. The Stanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial complex
In this section, we review some facts about the Stanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial complex which will be used in proving Theorem 1.2 (1). Our main reference is [Sta96].
Let S be a non-empty finite set. A simplicial complex  on the vertex set S is a collection of subsets of S that is closed under inclusion. A subset F of S is called a face of  if F   and is called a non-face of  if F  . The dimension of a face F is dim F := |F |-1 and the dimension of  is dim  := maxF  dim F . A maximal face under inclusion is called a facet and  is said to be pure if all facets have the same dimension.
Let k be a field and let k[Xs | s  S] denote the polynomial algebra over k in the variables Xs indexed by the vertex set S. Given a subset F of S, let XF denote the monomial sF Xs. The face ring (or the Stanley-Reisner ring) k[] of  is then defined to be the quotient ring
k[] := k[Xs|s  S]/I,
where I is the Stanley-Reisner ideal defined by I := (XF |F  ). It is clear that I can be defined by using only monomials corresponding to minimal non-faces of .

5

Next recall that the Hilbert-Poincar´e series of an N-graded k-vector space M (with dimk M i finite for all i) is defined by P (M, t) := i0(dimk M i)ti. Suppose that dim  = d - 1 and regard the variables Xs as being of degree one. The face ring k[] is then a graded ring and its Hilbert-Poincar´e series is given by:

(1)

P

(k[],

t)

=

d-1 i=-1

fiti+1 (1 - t)i+1

,

where f-1 = 1 and fi := fi(), i  0, is the number of i-dimensional faces of  ([Sta96, Theorem 1.4]). The sequence (f0, . . . , fd-1) is called the f -vector of . Writing P (k[], t) in the form

(2)

P (k[],

t)

=

h0

+

h1t + · · · + (1 - t)d

hdtd ,

then the sequence (h0, . . . , hd) is called the h-vector of . In terms of the f -vector, each hk := hk() is

given by hk =

ki=0(-1)k-i

d-i k-i

fi-1. In particular, hd =

di=0(-1)d-ifi-1 and so

(3)

hd() = (-1)d-1~(),

where ~() = i-1(-1)ifi = i-1(-1)i dimk Hi(; k) is the reduced Euler characteristic of . Here
Hi(; k) denotes the reduced homology of  with coefficients in k ([Sta96, Definition 3.1]). We will also need to express hd in terms of the reduced characteristic of the Alexander dual of . Recall that the Alexander dual  of  is the simplicial complex with the same vertex set S such that a subset F of S is a face of 
if the complement S \ F is not a face of . Since for each 0  i  |S|, the number of subsets of cardinality i of S is equal to fi-1() + f|S|-i-1() and the alternating sum of these numbers is zero, it follows that ~() + (-1)|S|~() = 0, and so

(4)

hd() = (-1)|S|-d~().

We review now some commutative algebra. Let R be an N-graded algebra over k. The Krull dimension of R, denoted dim R, is the maximal number of algebraically independent homogeneous elements of R. Suppose dim R = d. A sequence (1, . . . , d) of homogeneous elements of R is called a homogeneous system of parameters (h.s.o.p.) if R/(1, . . . , d) is a finite-dimensional k-vector space. Equivalently, (1, . . . , d) is a h.s.o.p if 1, . . . , d are algebraically independent and R is a finitely-generated k[1, . . . , d]-module. A h.s.o.p. (1, . . . , d) is called a linear system of parameters (l.s.o.p.) if each i is of degree one.
The Krull dimension of the face ring k[] is 1 + dim  ([Sta96, Theorem 1.3]). Note that the existence of a l.s.o.p for k[] is assured by Noether's Normalization Lemma when k is infinite. When k is finite, one may need to pass to an infinite extension field which does not affect the Cohen-Macaulay property. We need the following result to recognize a l.s.o.p. in k[].
Lemma 2.1 ([Sta96, Lemma 2.4]). (1) Let k[] be a face ring of Krull dimension d and let 1, . . . , d  k[]1. Then (1, . . . , d) is a l.s.o.p. for k[] if and only if for every face F of , the restrictions 1|F , . . . , d|F span a vector space of dimension equal to |F |. Here the restriction |F of an element  = sS sXs of k[]1 to a face F is defined by |F = sF sXs.
(2) If (1, . . . , d) is a l.s.o.p. for k[], then the quotient ring k[]/(1, . . . , d) is spanned as a k-vector space by the monomials XF , F  .

Next recall that a sequence (1, . . . , d) of homogeneous elements of an N-graded k-algebra R is called a regular sequence if i+1 is not a zero-divisor in R/(1, . . . , i) for 0  i < d. Equivalently, (1, . . . , d) is a regular sequence if 1, . . . , d are algebraically independent and R is a finite-dimensional free k[1, . . . , d]module. The k-algebra R is Cohen-Macaulay if it admits a regular sequence. It is known that if R is
Cohen-Macaulay then any h.s.o.p. is a regular sequence. If the face ring k[] is Cohen-Macaulay, then we
say that  is a Cohen-Macaulay complex (over k). A fundamental result of G. A. Reisner [Rei76] states that  is Cohen-Macaulay over k if and only if for all F   and all i < dim(lkF ), we have Hi(lkF ; k) = 0. Here lkF is the link of F defined by lkF = {G  |G  F  , G  F = }.

6
Matroid complexes provide a rich source of Cohen-Macaulay complexes. A simplicial complex  on the vertex set S is a matroid complex if it satisfies the exchange property: given F, G   with |F | < |G|, there exists v  G \ F such that F  {v}  . This is the property satisfied by the independent sets of a matroid [Oxl11]. It is known that a matroid complex is pure and for every linear order of S, the induced lexicographical order on the facets of the matroid complex  make it into a shellable complex [Bjo92, Theorem 7.3.3]. Recall that a shellable complex is a pure simplicial complex  together with an order of its facets F1, . . . , Fs such that for each 1  i  s, the faces of i which do not belong to i-1 has a unique element (denoted by r(Fi)) with respect to inclusion ([Sta96, Definition 2.1]). Here 0 =  and i is the subcomplex generated by F1, . . . , Fi defined by i := 2F1  · · ·  2Fi , where 2F := {G : G  F }. A shellable complex is Cohen-Macaulay over any field; furthermore, if (1, . . . , d) is a l.s.o.p. for k[], then k[] is a free k[1, . . . , d]-module with basis {Xr(Fi) : 1  i  s} ([Bjo84, Theorem 1.7, Corollary 1.8] or [Sta96, Theorem 2.5]).
We summarize the above discussions in the following proposition which will be used in the next sections. For this we identify the polynomial algebra k[Xs|s  S] with the symmetric power algebra S(kS) where kS denotes the k-vector space of functions from S to k. The dual of kS is the space k S of formal sums
sS sYs with s  k where Ys is dual to Xs. For each monomorphism of vector spaces  : V  k S , let (I) denote the image of the Stanley-Reisner ideal I under the induced epimorphism  : S(kS)  S(V ). So (I) is the ideal of S(V ) generated by the polynomials (XF ) = sF (Xs), F  .
Proposition 2.2. Suppose dimk V = |S| - d and  : V  k S is a monomorphism which satisfies the property:
(*) For each face F of , the intersection of (V ) with the subspace k F of k S is trivial.
Then S(V )/(I) is spanned as a k-vector space by the (XF ), F  . In particular, the top-degree subspace (S(V )/(I))d is spanned as a k-vector space by the set {(XF )|F is facet of }. Furthermore, if  is Cohen-Macaulay over k (in particular if  is a matroid complex), then the Hilbert-Poincar´e series of S(V )/(I) is h0 + h1t + · · · + hdtd, where hd can be computed by hd = (-1)d-1~() = (-1)|S|-d~().

Proof. Let  : k S  W be the cokernel of . So dimk W = d and there is a short exact sequence of vector spaces 0  V - k S - W  0. For each face F of , the triviality of (V )  k F implies the
injectivity of the composition k F  k S - W . Taking the dual of this we see that the composition
W  - kS  kF is surjective. Note that kS  kF is the restriction map   |F defined in Lemma 2.1 above. It follows that if we choose a basis w1, . . . , wd of W  and put i = (wi), then 1|F , . . . , d|F span kF , and so by Proposition 2.1(1), (1, . . . , d) is a l.s.o.p. for k[]. The map  now induces an isomorphism of k-algebras:

(5)

k[]/(1, . . . , d) = k S(W ) (S(kS)/I) = S(V )/(I).

By Proposition 2.1(2), this isomorphism implies that the k-vector space S(V )/(I) is spanned by the (XF ), F  . If k[] is Cohen-Macaulay, then k[] is free over k[1, . . . , d] and so the Hilbert-Poincar´e series of k[]/(1, . . . , d) is equal to (1 - t)dP (k[], t) = h0 + h1t + · · · + hdtd.

3. R(V , k) and the Steinberg module
Let p be a prime and let Fq denote a finite field of q = ps elements. Let V be an n-dimensional vector space over Fq. Given a linear vector space W , denote by LW the set of lines (i.e. 1-dimensional linear subspaces) in W and by HW the set of hyperplanes (i.e. 1-codimensional linear subspaces) in W . A set of lines {1, . . . , m} in W is called an m-frame of W if {1, . . . , m} linearly spans an m-dimensional subspace of W .

7
Definition 3.1. Let (V ) be the simplicial complex on the vertex set L := LV  in which a face is of the form L \ F where F is a set of lines which linearly spans V . More generally, for each k  1, let (V , k) be the simplicial complex on L  · · ·  L (the disjoint union of k copies of L ) in which a face is of the form (L \ F1)  · · ·  (L \ Fk) where the union F1  · · ·  Fk linearly spans V .
It is straightforward to check that a facet of (V ) is of the form L \ F where F is an n-frame of V  and a minimal non-face of (V ) is of the form L \ LH where H is a hyperplane of V . Similarly a facet of (V , k) is of the form (L \ F1)  · · ·  (L \ Fk) where F1, . . . , Fk form a partition of a frame of V  and a minimal non-face of (V , k) is of the form (L \ LH )  · · ·  (L \ LH ) where H is a hyperplane of V . The cardinality of a facet of (V , k) is
d := k(qn - 1)/(q - 1) - n, and so (V , k) is a (d - 1)-dimensional simplicial complex. Lemma 3.2. (V , k) is a matroid complex.

Proof. Recall that the dual of a matroid complex  on S is defined to be the simplicial complex # on S such that F is a facet of # if S \ F is a facet of . It is known that the dual of a matroid complex is also a matroid complex [Oxl11, Theorem 2.1.1].
Let (V , k) denote the simplicial complex on L  · · ·  L in which F1  · · ·  Fk is a face if F1, . . . , Fk form a partition of a frame of V . The exchange property is easily checked for (V , k) and so it is a matroid complex. Since a facet of (V , k) is of the form F1  · · ·  Fk where F1, . . . , Fk form a partition of an n-frame of V , it follows that the dual of the matroid complex (V , k) is (V , k), and so (V , k) is also a matroid complex.

The space Fq L  · · ·  L is the space of formal sums 1ik, L ,iY,i with ,i  Fq, where Y,i corresponds to   L with L being at the i-th position in the disjoint union L  · · ·  L . For each line  in V , choose a nonzero linear form u on it. Such a choice gives rise to a homomorphism  : V  Fq L  · · ·  L defined by

(v) =

u(v)Y,i.

1ik, L

Lemma 3.3. The map  is a monomorphism satisfying the property (*) and its dual  : FLq ···L  V  sends each basis element X,i to u.

Proof. That  is a monomorphism is clear. Given (L \ F1)  · · ·  (L \ Fk) a face of (V , k), if (v) = 1ik, L u(v)Y,i belongs to Fq (L \ F1)  · · ·  (L \ Fk) , then we must have u(v) = 0 for all  
F1  · · ·  Fk, which implies that v = 0 since F1  · · ·  Fk linearly spans V . For the second assertion, we have

(X,i)(v) = X,i((v)) = X,i

u(v)Y,i = u(v)

1ik, L

for all v  V .

We now prove the following which is the first part of Theorem 1.2. Proposition 3.4. R(V , k) is trivial in degree greater than d, and in this degree, it is isomorphic to the twisted Steinberg module Stn  detk-1.
Proof. Recall that a minimal non-face of (V , k) is of the form (L \ LH )  · · ·  (L \ LH ) where H is a hyperplane of V . The generator of the Stanley-Reisner ideal I(V ,k) of Fq[X,i |   L , 1  i  k]

8

corresponding to such a minimal non-face is 1ik, L \LH X,i. By Lemma 3.3, this is sent by  to L \LH u k in S(V ). It follows that the ideal (I(V ,k)) of S(V ) is generated by the polynomials L \LH u k where H runs over the set of hyperplanes of V . The quotient ring S(V )/(I(V ,k)) is
thus exactly the ring R(V , k) defined in the introduction.

Since (V , k) is a matroid complex (Lemma 3.2) and  satisfies the property (*) (Lemma 3.3), we can
apply Proposition 2.2 to analyze the top-degree module R(V , k)d. Given a facet of (V , k) of the form F := (L \ F1)  · · ·  (L \ Fk) where F1, . . . , Fk form a partition of an n-frame {1, . . . , n} of V , the corresponding generator (XF ) of R(V , k)d is given by

(XF ) =

L
u1 · · ·

u un

k

.

It is well-known that the "product of lines" L u is up to a nonzero scalar equal to Ln where

Ln = L(x1, . . . , xn) := det(xjqi-1 )1i,jn.

Since

GLn

on

the

set

V ,

it

follows

that

if

we

put

Lkn x1···xn

then

by

Proposition 2.2, { ·g | g  GLn} is a spanning set of R(V , k)d. But it is known that ([Mit85, Corollary A.7])

 is fixed by e(nk-1), where e(nk-1) is the idempotent corresponding to the twisted Steinberg representation

Stn  detk-1. It follows that the GLn-linear map

Stn  detk-1 = e(nk-1) · Fq[GLn]  R(V , k)d, e(nk-1) · g   · g,

is an epimorphism. To conclude that this is an isomorphism, we need to show that the dimension of R(V , k)d

is

n(n-1)

that to every poset (partially ordered sets) P , one can associate a simplicial complex c(P ), called the order

complex of P , whose faces are the chains (i.e. totally ordered subsets) of P . The (reduced) homology of P

is defined to be the (reduced) homology of c(P ). Inversely, to every simplicial complex , one can associate

a poset p(), called the face poset of , which is defined to be the poset of nonempty faces ordered by

inclusion. It is known that c(p()), called the barycentric subdivision of , and  have the same geometric

realizations. Now let T denote the Tits building which is defined by

T := partially ordered sets (poset) of proper subspaces of V .

It is well-known that H(T ; Fq) is only nontrivial in degree n - 2, and in this degree, Hn-2(T ; Fq) = Stn
n(n-1)
(Solomon and Tits). Note that the dimension of Hn-2(T ; Fq), which is q 2 , can be computed by induction using an exact sequence as in [Lus74, Theorem 1.14]. The Alexander dual  := (V , k) is related to the Tits building as follows. By definition,  is the simplicial complex on L  · · ·  L in which a face is of the form F1  · · ·  Fk where the union F1  · · ·  Fk does not linearly spans V . Consider the map of posets f : p()  T which sends a face F1  · · ·  Fk to the subspace spanned by F1  · · ·  Fk. For each proper subspace W of V , the poset f -1(TW ) is contractible because it has LW  · · ·  LW as its unique maximal
element. The Quillen Fiber Lemma [Qui78] then implies that f is a homotopy equivalence. The identity
q(q-1)
hd = q 2 follows.

4. R(V , k) as a P-module
In this section we prove the second part of Theorem 1.2. For this we first review some facts about the action of the Steenrod algebra P on S(V ) = Fq[x1, . . . , xn]. Larry Smith [Smi07] defined the Steenrod algebra P := P(Fq) as the Fq-subalgebra of the endomorphism algebra of the functor V  S(V ), generated by certains natural transformations 1 = P0, P1, P2, . . .. It is sufficient for us to know that the action of the operations Pi on S(V ) satisfies:

9

· the unstable condition: Pi(f ) = f q if i = deg f and Pi(f ) = 0 if i > deg f , f  S(V ), and · the Cartan formula: Pk(f g) = i+j=k Pi(f )Pj(g), f, g  S(V ).

Denote by P the total Steenrod operation 1 + P1 + P2 + · · · . These properties then implies that the map P : Fq[x1, . . . , xn]  Fq[x1, . . . , xn], f  Pi(f ),
i0
is a homomorphism of algebras which satisfies P(x) = x + xq for all linear form x.

The algebra P is also a Hopf algebra with the coproduct  : P  P  P defined by

(Pm) =

Pi  Pj, m  1.

i+j=m

The canonical anti-automorphism (the antipode)  : P  P then satisfies the relations:

Pi(Pj ) =

(Pi)Pj = 0, m  1.

i+j=m

i+j=m

This can be used to show that

(Pi)(x) =

(-1)ixqr

if

i

=

qr -1 q-1

,

0

otherwise.

Since  is a map of coalgebras, the Cartan formula also holds for (Pk):

(Pk)(f · g) =

(Pi)(f ) · (Pj )(g), f, g  S(V ).

i+j=k

In order to simplify signs, we write Pi for (-1)i(Pi) and let P = 1 + P1 + P2 + · · · denote the (signed) total conjugate Steenrod operation. The above formulae for  then implies that the map

P : Fq[x1, . . . , xn]  Fq[[x1, . . . , xn]], f  Pi(f ),
i0

is a homomorphism of algebras which satisfies P(x) = x + xq + xq2 + · · · for all linear form x. Here Fq[[x1, . . . , xn]] denotes the Fq-algebra of power series in x1, . . . , xn.

Finally, for all k  1 and f, g  S(V ), we recall the following congruence Pk(f ) · g  f · (Pk)(g) (mod P+S(V )),

which is known as the the -trick [Woo89]. This follows from the identity

Proposition 4.1 (Theorem 1.2 (2.a)). For each 0  i  d, the natural projection S(V )  R(V , k) induces an isomorphism of GLn-modules Qi(S(V )) = Qi(R(V , k)).

We need the following lemma whose proof will be given below.

10

We prove Theorem 1.2 (2.b) by proving the following:

Proposition 4.3.

(1)

Rn,k

can

be

embedded

as

a

P -submodule

into

a

direct

product

of

q n -1 q-1

copies

of

Rn-1,qk  R1,k.

(2) For all u  Rn,k, we have (Pi)(u) = 0 whenever |u| + qi > d. In particular, the top-degree module

Rdn,k is P-indecomposable.

In order to prove this proposition, we need the following lemma whose proof will be again given later.
Lemma 4.4. For each 0 = y  V , I(V , k) + (yk) = I(W, qk) + (yk) where W is linear complement of Fq y in V .

Proof of Proposition 4.3. The kernel of the natural map of P-modules S(V )  LV  S(V )/(uk ) is the principal ideal of S(V ) generated by Lkn. Since Lkn belongs to the ideal IV ,k, this map induces an inclusion of P-modules

S(V )/I(V , k) 

S(V )/(I(V , k) + (uk )).

LV 

The first part of the proposition now follows from Lemma 4.4.

For the second part, by induction we see that Rn,k is embedded in a direct product of copies of Fq[x]/(xqn-1k)  · · ·  Fq[x]/(xk). By Cartan formula, it suffices now to prove that, for all m  0, we have (Pi)(xt) = 0 in Fq[x]/(xqmr) whenever t + qi > qmr - 1. Suppose in contrary that (Pi)(xt) = 0, then using -trick and instability, we have up to a nonzero scalar

xqmr-1 = xqmr-1-(q-1)i-t · (Pi)(xt)  xt · Pi(xqmr-1-(q-1)i-t) = 0

modulo P-decomposable elements in Fq[x]/(xqmr). This contradicts the fact that the "spike" xqmr-1 is Pindecomposable in Fq[x]/(xqmr). Indeed if xqmr-1 were P-decomposable, then up to nonzero scalar it would be the image under some operation Ppa of xqmr-1-pa(q-1) (noting that P is multiplicatively generated by all the Ppa, a  0, and not by all the Pqa, a  0 [Smi07, page 338]). But we have

Ppa (xqmr-1-pa(q-1)) =

qmr - 1 - pa(q - 1) pa

xqmr-1 =

(qmr - paq) + (pa - 1) pa

xqmr-1.

11

Since qmr - paq > 0, we get qm > paq/r > pa, and so (qmr - paq) is divisible by pa+1. It follows that pa does

not appear in the p-adic expansion of (qmr - paq) + (pa - 1) and so the binomial coefficient

(q m r-pa q )+(pa -1) pa

is zero, completing the proof that xqmr-1 is P-indecomposable.

Remark 4.5. The second part of Proposition 4.3 is equivalent to the fact that the P-module dD(Rn,k) is unstable. Here given M a P-module, D(M ) is the Spanier-Whitehead dual of M , which is defined by

(DM )-i = HomFq (M i, Fq), i  Z, (f ) = f  (()), f  DM,   P.

We now present the proofs of the above lemmas.

Proof of Lemma 4.2. Recall that the map P : Fq[x1, . . . , xn]  Fq[[x1, . . . , xn]], f  i0 Pi(f ), is a homomorphism of algebras and P(x) = x + xq + xq2 + · · · for each linear form x. Here Pi = (-1)i(Pi)
and P = 1 + P1 + P2 + · · · .

Put P (x1, . . . , xn-1; y1, . . . , yr) := P in=-11(1 - xiq-1) · y1qs · · · yrqs and let R(x1, . . . , xn-1; y1, . . . , yr)

denote its homogeneous component of degree qn-1+sr. Since

n-1 i=1

(1

-

xiq-1)

=

in=-01(-1)iei, the lemma

will follow from the identity

R(x1, . . . , xn-1; y1, . . . , yr) = V(x1, . . . , xn-1, y1)qs · · · V(x1, . . . , xn-1, yr)qs .

For this it is sufficient to prove that R(x1, . . . , xn-1; y1, . . . , yr) is null whenever each yj is a linear combination of x1, . . . , xn-1. Since P (x1, . . . , xn-1; y1, . . . , yr) is linear in each yj and symmetric in x1, . . . , xn-1 as well as in y1, . . . , yr, we need only to prove that R(x1, . . . , xn-1; y1, . . . , yr) is null if y1 = x1. But since P(x1(1 - x1q-1)) = P(x1 - xq1) = x1, it follows that

n-1

r

P (x1, . . . , xn-1; x1, y2, . . . , yr) = x1(x1 + xq1 + · · · )qs-1

j=2

It is clear that a monomial occurring in this product is of the form x11+i1 xi22 · · · xinn--11 y2j2 · · · yrjr where (i1)  s(q - 1), (i)  {0, q - 1} for 2    n - 1, and (j) = 1 for 2    r. Here the function  is defined by (a) := a0 + a1 + · · · where a = a0 + a1q + a2q2 + · · · is the q-adic expansion of a. It follows that if the degree of such a monomial is qn-1+sr then we must have

(qn-1+sr - 1) = (i1 + i2 + · · · + in-1 + j2 + · · · + jr)  (i1) + (i2) + · · · + (in-1) + (j2) + · · · + (jr)  (n - 2 + s)(q - 1) + (r - 1).

This is a contradiction since we have qn-1+sr - 1 = (q - 1)(1 + q + · · · + qn-2+s) + (r - 1)qn-1+s, which implies that (qn-1+sr - 1) = (n - 1 + s)(q - 1) + (r - 1). The lemma follows.

Proof of Lemma 4.4. Let W be a linear complement of Fq y in V . If H is a hyperplane of V  not passing through y, then VH,V  = LV /LH is divisible by y. It follows that I(V , k) + (yk) is generated by (yk) and the VHk ,V 's where H is a hyperplane passing through y. Let H be such a hyperplane. Then W  := H  W is a hyperplane in W and H = Fq y  W . Choose a basis {y2, . . . , yn} of W such that {y2, . . . , yn-1} is a

12

basis of W . We have

yqn-1 y2qn-1 · · · ynqn--11

yqn-1 y2qn-1 · · · ynqn-1

Noting that 1  r  q - 1, this gives

LqW VH,V   LqW mod (yr),

and so VH,V   VWq ,W mod (yr). From this we deduce that VHqs,V   VWqs+,1W mod (y1qsr) and thus we get

VHqs,rV   VWqs+,1Wr mod (y1qsr).

The result follows.

Remark 4.6. We note that, by putting n = m + 1, in the simplest case where r = 1 and s = 0, this lemma

gives:

V(x1, . . . , xm, x) = (-1)m

m

(P

i=0

Comparing this with the formula defining the Dickson invariants Qm,0, . . . , Qm,m-1 [Dic11]:

m-1
V(x1, . . . , xm, x) = (-1)m-j Qm,j xqj ,
j=0

we obtain

Qm,j =

Note that ([MW02, Lemma 2.4]) if f is of degree s and (r(q - 1) + s) > s then Pr(f ) = 0 (this is proved

easily by letting P act on a product of s linear form, and then using the definition of the function ).

Applying this to each term in the above expression of Qm,j, we have



qm - qj q-1

-i

(q - 1) + i(q - 1)

= (qm - qj) = (m - j)(q - 1) > i(q - 1)  m - j > i.

It follows that the expression above for Qm,j can be simplified to:

Qm,j =

m

(P

qm -qj q-1

i=m-j

For j = 0, we thus recover in a different way the formula for the top Dickson invariant Qm,0 in [MW02,

5. Proof of Theorem 1.4

In this section we prove the following: Theorem 5.1 (Theorem 1.4). dimFq Qqn-1-n(S(V )) = (q - 1)(q2 - 1) · · · (qn-1 - 1), n  2.
This is proved by considering a matroid complex K which can be seen as an affine version of the complex (V ). To define K, let us fix a hyperplane W in V  and let E denote an affine space not containing the origin and parallel to W . Let K be the simplicial complex on the vertex set E in which a face is of the form E \ F where F affinely spans E, or equivalently, F linearly spans V .

13
We check easily that the facets of K are complements in E of affine bases of E and a minimal non-face of K is of the form E \ H where H is a hyperplane in the affine space E. Since a facet of K has cardinality d := qn-1 - 1, K is a (d - 1)-dimensional simplicial complex.
The Alexander dual K of K is the simplicial complex on the vertex set E in which F is a face if F does not affinely span E. A facet of K is thus a hyperplane in the affine space E.
Lemma 5.2. K is a matroid complex.

Proof. Let B be the simplicial complex on E whose faces are affinely independent subsets of E. It is clear that E is a matroid complex. The dual of this matroid complex is K and so K is also a matroid complex. Lemma 5.3. The map  : V  Fq E defined by (v) = E (v)Y is a monomorphism satisfying the property (*) and its dual  : FEq  V  sends each basis element X  FEq to   V .
Proof. It is clear that  is a monomorphism. Now given E \ F a face of K, if (v) = E (v)Y belongs to Fq E \ F , then one must have (v) = 0 for all   F , which implies that v = 0 since F is a spanning set of V .

Now we can apply Proposition 2.2 to study S(V )/(IK). The Stanley-Reisner ideal IK is generated by the monomials E\H X where H is running on the set of hyperplanes in the affine space E. It follows that the polynomials H := E\H  generates the ideal I := (IK ) of S(V ). Note that I is stable under the action of the affine subgroup Aff(E) of GL(V ) and so the natural projection S(V )  S(V )/I is a map of Aff(E)-modules.
Proposition 5.4. For each 0  i  qn-1 - n, the natural projection S(V )  S(V )/I induces an isomorphism of Aff(E)-modules Qi(S(V )) = Qi(S(V )/I).

Proof. Let H be a hyperplane in the affine space E. We need to prove that f · H is P-decomposable whenever
deg(f )  (qn-1 - n) - deg(H ) = (qn-1 - n) - (qn-1 - qn-2) = qn-2 - n.
Suppose E = y + W and H = y + W  where y  H and W  is a hyperplane in W . Choose a basis {y1, . . . , yn-1} of W such that {y1, . . . , yn-2} is a basis of W . We have

H =

(w + ayn-1 + y) =

V(y1, . . . , yn-2, ayn-1 + y),

wW ,aF×q

aF×q

and so by Lemma 4.2,

n-2
H = (-1)n-2 (Pqn-2-1-i) ei · Y ,

i=0
where ei := ei(y1q-1, . . . , ynq--12) and Y = aF×q (ayn-1 + y). By instability, Pqn-2-1-i(f ) = 0 for all 0  i  n - 2 and so the result follows from the -trick.

Proposition 5.5. S(V )/I can be embedded as a P-submodule into a direct product of qn-1 copies of R(W, q - 1).

Proof. The kernel of the natural map S(V )  yE S(V )/(y) is the principal ideal of S(V ) generated by yE y. Since this generator belongs to I, this map induces an inclusion of P-modules:
S(V )/I  S(V )/I + (y).
yE
It suffices now to prove that, for each y  E, I + (y) = I(W, q - 1)+ (y), and so S(V )/I + (y) = R(W, q - 1). Indeed, given H a hyperplane in E, if y  H then H is divisible by y. If y  H then E = y + W and

14

H = y + W  where W  is a hyperplane in W . Choose a basis {y1, . . . , yn-1} of W such that {y1, . . . , yn-2} is a basis of W . We have then

H =

(w + ayn-1 + y) 

V(y1, . . . , yn-2, ayn-1) (mod (y))

wW ,aF×q

aF×q
= -V(y1, . . . , yn-2, yn-1)q-1 (mod (y))

The result follows.

= -VWq-1,W (mod (y)).

By Proposition 4.3, we know that the top-degree module Rqn-1-n(W, q - 1) is P-indecomposable, and so the above proposition implies that the top-degree module (S(V )/I)qn-1-n is P-indecomposable. Combining this with Proposition 5.4 yields an isomorphism:
Qqn-1-n(S(V )) = (S(V )/I)qn-1-n.
To compute the dimension of (S(V )/I)qn-1-n, we need to compute the reduce Euler characteristic ~(K). Recall that the Alexander dual K of K is the simplicial complex on the vertex set E in which a face is a set of points F such that F does not affinely span E. Folowing Lusztig [Lus74], let S be the poset of all affine subspaces of E other than E (which is denoted by SI (E) in [Lus74]). Then as in the linear case, the map of posets f : p(K)  S sending a face F of K to the affine subspace spanned by F is a homotopy equivalence. This is because for each affine subspace E of E other than E, the poset f -1(SE) has E as its unique maximal element. The homotopy equivalence then again follows from the Quillen Fiber lemma.
The reduced homology H(S; Fq) is only nontrivial in degree n - 2, and in this degree, Hn-2(S; Fq), known as the affine Steinberg module associated to E [Lus74, 1.14], is of dimension (q - 1)(q2 - 1) · · · (qn-1 - 1). It follows that ~(K) is up to sign equal to this dimension and so the proof of Theorem 1.4 is complete.
Remark 5.6. By Proposition 2.2, the elements yE\B , where B is an affine basis of E, span the Fq-vector space (S(V )/I)qn-1-n. It would be interesting to figure out a basis of this space from a shelling of the matroid complex K. Since (q - 1)(q2 - 1) · · · (qn-1 - 1) is also the dimension of each complex cuspidal representation of GLn, it would also be interesting to study (S(V )/I)qn-1-n as a modular representation of GLn and relate it to the discrete series constructed by Lusztig in [Lus74, Chapter 3].

6. Steinberg summand of Rn,2 and Brown-Gitler modules

In this section we prove Theorem 1.5. Suppose q = 2. We recall that Rn,2 = F2[x1, . . . , xn]/In,2, where In,2 is the ideal generated by the orbit of the action of GLn on Vn2 , where

Put d = 2(2n - 1) - n =

Vn =

(1x1 + · · · + n-1xn-1 + xn).

iF2

nj=1(2j - 1). We need to prove that there is an isomorphism of A-modules

n d-(2j-1)B(2j - 1) -= Rn,2 · en.

j=0

Here B(k) denotes the Brown-Gitler module B(k) := A/A (Sqi) | 2i > k . Note that kDB(k) is isomorphic to the unstable Brown-Gitler module J(k) (D denoting the Spanier-Whitehead dual) [LZ87, Proposition 5.4.4].

We prove the above decomposition of Rn,2 · en by proving the following propositions. Proposition 6.1. There is an A-generating set {0, 1, . . . , n} with |j| = d - (2j - 1) for Rn,2 · en.

15

Proof. Recall that Rn,2 is a quotient of the polynomial algebra F2[x1, . . . , xn] which is trivial in degree greater than d. In [Ino02], M. Inoue proved that the Steinberg summand F2[x1, . . . , xn] · en is minimally A-generated by the classes
Sq2i1 · · · Sq2in ( 1 ) x1 . . . xn
where i1 > i2 > · · · > in  0. In degrees less than or equal to d, these corresponds to the sequences (i1, . . . , in) = (2n, . . . , 2j, . . . , 1) with 0  j  n. Projecting these generators to Rn,2 · en gives the desired result.
Remark 6.2. The above generating set for Rn,2 is minimal since we have Qi(Sn) = Qi(Rn,2) in the range 0  i  d (Proposition 4.1). However we do not need this fact to produce the surjective map in the following proposition.

Proposition 6.3. Evaluating on the generators 0, 1, . . . , n induces an epimorphism of A-modules:

n

n

|j|B(d - |j|) =

d-(2j-1)B(2j - 1)  Rn,2 · en.

j=0

j=0

Proof. Evaluating on the generators 0, 1, . . . , n yields an epimorphism of A-modules:

n

j=0

This map factors through the canonical projection

Proposition 6.4. In each degree, the dimension of Rn,2 · en is greater than or equal to the dimension of

Proof. Using the exact sequences (known as Mahowald's exact sequences)

0  2j-1 B(2j-1)  B(2j )  B(2j - 1)  0,

we see that the Hilbert-Poincar´e series of

follows that
