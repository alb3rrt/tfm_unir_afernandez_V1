Abstract
The network coloring game has been proposed in the literature of social sciences as a model for conflictresolution circumstances. The players of the game are the vertices of a graph with n vertices and maximum degree . The game is played over rounds, and in each round all players simultaneously choose a color from a set of available colors. Players have local information of the graph: they only observe the colors chosen by their neighbors and do not communicate or cooperate with one another. A player is happy when she has chosen a color that is different from the colors chosen by her neighbors, otherwise she is unhappy, and a configuration of colors for which all players are happy is a proper coloring of the graph. It has been shown in the literature that, when the players adopt a particular greedy randomized strategy, the game reaches a proper coloring of the graph within O(log(n)) rounds, with high probability, provided the number of colors available to each player is at least  + 2. In this note we show that a modification of the aforementioned greedy strategy yields likewise a proper coloring of the graph, provided the number of colors available to each player is at least  + 1.

Throughout the text, given a positive integer n, we denote by [n] the set {1, . . . , n} and, given a finite set F , we denote by |F | its cardinality. Given a graph G = (V, E) and a vertex v  V , we denote the neighborhood of v by N (v) = {u  V : (u, v)  E}. The cardinality of N (v) is the degree of v. All graphs considered in this note are finite, without loops, undirected and simple. A coloring of a graph G = (V, E) is an assignment of colors to the elements of V . A coloring which uses at most k colors is called a k-coloring. A k-coloring is proper when no two adjacent vertices receive the same color. The problem of determining the smallest possible value of k for which a graph admits a proper k-coloring is classical. It is well known to be NPhard, and has attracted an immense attention both from a theoretical as well as a practical perspective. A particular line of research focuses on games / algorithms for graph coloring, with the corresponding literature being vast (see, for example, [2, 5, 6] for textbooks devoting whole chapters to the topic).
In this note we shall be concerned with a particular game for graph coloring, which is referred to as the network coloring game. The network coloring game is introduced and studied empirically in [3] as a model for conflict-resolution circumstances. The game is played on a graph G = (V, E) with |V | = n vertices and maximum degree . Each vertex of G is a player, having a set of k available colors, and participates in a game that is played over a number of rounds. In each round all players simultaneously choose a color

from their set of available colors, which is assumed to be the set [k]. Players have local information on
the graph: they can only observe the colors of their neighbors, and cannot communicate or cooperate with one another. A player is happy if she has chosen a color that is different from the colors chosen by her neighbors. Otherwise, the player is unhappy. In game-theoretic language, the payoff to a player is 1, if she is happy, and is 0 if she is unhappy, and a configuration of colors for which every player receives payoff 1 is a Nash equilibrium of the game, in the sense that no player has the incentive to change strategy under such
a configuration. The problem is to find a symmetric strategy for the players (i.e., a strategy that is the same for all players)
that achieves convergence to a Nash equilibrium after a finite number of rounds, using the smallest possible value for k. Proving that a particular symmetric strategy is optimal (i.e., it minimizes the (expected) time to equilibrium) is probably an elusive problem, and a more realistic line of research is to propose "reasonable"
symmetric strategies and estimate their time to Nash equilibrium.
Such a strategy has been proposed in [1], and will be referred to as the Greedy strategy. In order to formally define the Greedy strategy, let us introduce some notation. Let ct(v) be the color chosen by player v after round t. Notice that a player is unhappy after round t if there exists u  N (v) such that ct(u) = ct(v). Moreover, let Ct(v) be the set consisting of the colors chosen by the neighbors of v after round t, i.e., Ct(v) =
uN (v){ct(u)}. Greedy strategy. Suppose that k   + 2 and that each player adopts the following strategy: if a
player, say v, is happy after a certain round, say t, then she sticks to her color for all subsequent rounds, i.e., cs(v) = ct(v) for all s > t. If she is unhappy after round t, then in the next round she changes color, and chooses the color ct+1(v) uniformly at random from the set [k] \ Ct(v), consisting of those colors which are not chosen by any of her neighbors after round t.

Remark 1. Notice that, when all players in the network coloring game adopt the Greedy strategy, a happy player remains happy in all subsequent rounds. Notice also that, since k   + 2, it holds |[k] \ Ct(v)|  2 for all v  V and all rounds t  1. In particular, this implies that for every unhappy player, there are always at least two colors that are not chosen by her neighbors. Let us also remark that the assumption k   + 2 is crucial in the Greedy strategy. Indeed, if k =  + 1 then the Greedy strategy may result in a game that never reaches a Nash equilibrium, as can be
easily seen by employing the strategy to a triangle-graph (see also [1, Theorem 2]).

It is shown in [1] that, when all players adopt the Greedy strategy, the expected number of unhappy players decays exponentially in each round. More concretely, for every player v  V , let v denote the first round after which player v becomes happy. Then  = maxv v is the first round after which all players are happy. Notice that at round  the graph is properly k-colored and the payoff to every player equals 1. In other words, after time  the game reaches a Nash equilibrium. The following statement is the main result
in [1].

Theorem 1 (Chaudhuri, Chung-Graham, Jamall [1]). Let G be a graph on n vertices and maximum degree . Suppose that the number of available colors to each player is k   + 2 and that each player in the network coloring game adopts the Greedy strategy. Let  be the first round after which all players are happy. Then, for any starting assignment of colors to the vertices, it holds

where C = 1050e9 and  > 0 is arbitrarily small.

In other words, when the players in the network coloring game adopt the Greedy strategy, the game

converges to a Nash equilibrium in O

log

n 

rounds with probability at least 1 - . Improved estimates

on the expected value of  can be found in [7, Theorem 3]. In this note we combine some ideas from

the approaches in [1] and [7] and deduce a refinement of Theorem 1. A bit more concretely, we show

that a modification of the above-mentioned Greedy strategy allows to deduce the same conclusion as in

Theorem 1, subject to the assumption that the number of colors available to each player is at least  + 1.

We refer to this modified Greedy strategy as a Frugal strategy, which is formally defined as follows.

Frugal strategy. Suppose that k   + 1 and that each player in the network coloring game adopts the

following strategy: if a player, say v, is happy after a certain round, say t, then she sticks to her color for all

2

subsequent rounds, i.e., cs(v) = ct(v) for all s > t. If she is unhappy after round t, then in the next round she chooses uniformly at random a color from the set {ct(v)}  ([k] \ Ct(v)).
In other words, under the Frugal strategy, a player who is unhappy after round t  1 chooses in the next round a color uniformly at random from the set consisting of her color-choice after round t and the set of colors that are not chosen by her neighbors after round t.

Remark 2. Notice that, since k   + 1, it holds |{ct(v)}  ([k] \ Ct(v))|  2 for all v  V and all rounds t  1. In particular, every unhappy player has at least two colors to choose from in the next round. Notice also that, in contrast to the Greedy strategy, under the Frugal strategy an unhappy player may not change color in the next round.

In this note we imitate the analysis of the proof of Theorem 1, from [1], and show that the Frugal strategy converges to a Nash equilibrium in a finite number of rounds. More precisely, we obtain the following refinement of Theorem 1. Recall (see [9]) that a random variable X is stochastically smaller than a random variable Y , denoted X st Y , if it holds P(X > t)  P(Y > t), for all t.

Theorem 2. Let G be a graph on n vertices and maximum degree . Suppose that the number of available colors to each player is k   + 1 and that each player in the network coloring game adopts the Frugal strategy. Let  be the first round after which all players are happy. Then, for any starting assignment of colors to the vertices, it holds that  is stochastically smaller than a random variable T such that

We prove Theorem 2 in the next section. The proof mimics the proof of Theorem 1, from [1], and

proceeds in two steps. The first step concerns a lower estimate on the probability that a player, who is

unhappy after a certain round, say t, has "enough" available colors after round t + 1. The second step

concerns a lower estimate on the probability that the player becomes happy after round t + 2, given that she

has "enough" available colors after round t + 1. Both estimates do not depend on  and, when combined,

yield a lower bound on the probability that an unhappy player becomes happy after two rounds, which is

also independent of . Let us remark that the analysis over two rounds is crucial; over a single round it

2 Proof of main result

In this section we prove Theorem 2. We fix a starting assignment of colors to the vertices, and we assume that each player in the network coloring game adopts the Frugal strategy. We begin with a lower estimate
on the probability that a player, who is unhappy after a certain round, receives "enough" available colors in the next round. In order to be more precise, we need some extra piece of notation that will remain fixed
throughout this section. Recall that ct(v) is the color chosen by player v after round t and that Ct(v) is the set of colors chosen by
its neighbors. For every t  1, let Ht denote the set of happy players after round t, and set Ut = V \ Ht be the set of unhappy players after round t. Given v  Ut, let

At(v) = {ct(v)}  ([k] \ Ct(v))

be the set of colors available to v after round t; hence in the next round player v chooses the color ct+1(v)

uniformly at random from the set At(v).

Let also pt(v)

=

1 |At (v)|

denote the probability with which the

unhappy player v chooses her color in the next round. For v  Ht, set At(v) = {ct(v)} and pt(v) = 1.

Similarly, given a vertex v  V , let Ht(v) denote the set of happy neighbors of v after round t, and let

Ft(v) =

{ct(u)}

uHt (v)

3

be the set of colors chosen by the happy neighbors of v after round t, and Ut(v) = N (v) \ Ht(v) be the set

of unhappy neighbors of v. Notice that every color in the set [k] \ Ft(v) has a non-zero chance of belonging

to the set At+1(v). Finally, let ft(v) = |Ft(v)|, and notice that, since happy players stick to their choice, the

sequence {ft(v)}t1 is non-decreasing. Thus the number of colors available to v after round t + 1 as well as

after round t + 2 is at most k - ft(v). We now establish a lower bound on the probability that the number

of

colors

Lemma 1. For each t  1 and each v  Ut, it holds

.

Proof. To simplify notation, let f := ft(v). We first estimate E(|At+1(v)|) from below; the result then will follow from Markov's inequality. Recall that every element in the set [k]\Ft(v) has a non-zero probability of being an element of At+1(v). In particular, this implies that the cardinality of At+1 is at least the cardinality of the set consisting of those colors in [k] \ Ft(v) that are not chosen by any unhappy neighbor u  Ut(v). The probability that a fixed i  [k] \ Ft(v) is not chosen by any u  Ut(v) in the next round is equal to

(1 - pt(u)) .
{uUt(v):iAt (u)}
Therefore, using the arithmetic-geometric means inequality, we have

E(|At+1(v)|)

that

Putting the above together, we conclude

Now, since k

To complete the proof, let X = k - f - |At+1(v)| and apply the lower estimate on E(|At+1(v)|), together

with Markov's inequality, to deduce P

In the next lemma we estimate from below the probability that a player, who is unhappy after round t, becomes happy after two rounds. This will require some additional notation.

Fix a player v  Ut+1. Since v is unhappy, it follows that there exists u  N (v) such that ct+1(u) = ct+1(v). There are two kinds of unhappy neighbors of v participating in the game. Those that have the same color as player v, and those that have different color. This partitions the set Ut+1(v) into the sets

St+1(v) = {u  Ut+1(v) : ct+1(u) = ct+1(v)} and Dt+1(v) = {u  Ut+1(v) : ct+1(u) = ct+1(v)} .

Observe that for every u  St+1(v) it holds ct+1(v)  At+1(u), while for every u  Dt+1(v) it holds ct+1(v) / At+1(u). Moreover, since ct+1(u)  At+1(u), it follows that for every u  Dt+1(v) the set At+1(u) contains a color, namely, color ct+1(u), that is not contained in At+1(v).

Lemma 2. It holds

P(v

1 26e5

.

Proof. Let v  Ut. Then, conditional on At+1(v) and v  Ut+1, the probability that player v is happy after round t + 2 is the average of the probabilities that a fixed color from At+1(v) is not chosen by any unhappy neighbor u  Ut+1(v). To simplify notation, let us define, for each color i  [k], the sets

St(+i)1 := {u  St+1(v) : i  At+1(u)} and Dt(+i)1 := {u  Dt+1(v) : i  At+1(u)} .

For i  At+1(v) and u  Ut+1(v), let q(i; u) := P(ct+2(u) = i) be the probability that player u does not choose color i in the next round. Then the probability that a fixed color i  At+1(v) is not chosen by any player u  Ut+1(v) in the next round is equal to

q(i; u)

q(i; u) .

uSt(+i)1

uDt(+ i)1

Hence, conditional on At+1(v) and v  Ut+1, the probability that player v is happy after round t + 2 equals

where the estimate follows from the arithmetic-geometric means inequality. Now observe that ct+1(v)  At+1(v), and therefore it holds q(ct+1(v); u) = 1, for u  Dt+1(v). Moreover, for each u  Dt+1(v), the set At+1(u) contains at least one color (namely, ct+1(u)) that does not belong to At+1(v). The last two
observations imply that

q(i; u) =

The result

follows.

We now turn into the proof of our main result. Given v  V , let v be the first round after which player v is happy and set  = maxv v. We want to upper bound the expected value of  . Notice that the random variables v, v  V , are not mutually independent and our bound on  will be a worst-case estimate. To this end, we follow [7] and employ ideas from the theory of maximally dependent random variables. Given a real number µ > 0, let Eµ denote an exponential random variable of parameter µ.

If t is even, the proof is similar, and the result follows.

Now let  be the first round after which all players are happy. Then  = maxv v. The proof of our main result is almost complete. Given two random variables X, Y , let X  Y denote that fact that they have the
same distribution.

Proof of Theorem 2. Lemma 3 implies that, for all v  V , it holds v st Yv, where Yv  2 · Eµ. Since v st Yv it follows (see [9, Theorem 1.A.1]) that there exist random variables ^v, Y^v such that ^v  v, Y^v  Yv and ^v  Y^v with probability 1. Hence maxv ^v  maxv Y^v with probability 1. Since   maxv ^v, we conclude that  st 2 · M , where M is the maximum of n exponential random variables, say {Xv}vV , of parameter µ. Hence E( )  2 · E(M ) and it is therefore enough to establish an upper bound on E(M ). To this end, we
borrow ideas from [4]. Note that for every real number a we have M  a + v max{Xv - a, 0}; hence



E(M )  a + E(max{Xv - a, 0}) = a + n (1 - F (x)) dx ,
