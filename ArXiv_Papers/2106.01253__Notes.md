## Abstract

Equipping an experiment at FCC-ee with particle identification (PID) capabilities, in particular the ability to distinguish between hadron species, would bring great benefits to the physics programme. Good PID is essential for precise studies in quark flavour physics, and is also a great asset for many measurements in tau, top and Higgs physics. The requirements placed by flavour physics and these other applications are surveyed, with an emphasis on the momentum range over which PID is necessary. Possible solutions are discussed, including classical RICH counters, time-of-flight systems, and d$E$/d$x$ and cluster counting. Attention is paid to the impact on the global detector design that including PID capabilities would imply.
