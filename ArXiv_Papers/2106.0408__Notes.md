## Abstract

We establish the extended formalism for description of the static spherically symmetric relativistic non-equilibrium stellar systems in the formation of which the radiation pressure plays the key role. The main concept of this extended formalism inherits the ideas, on which the Israel-Stewart causal thermodynamics is based, but now the unit spacelike four-vector, indicated by the term director, is exploited in addition to the unit timelike medium velocity four-vector. An application of the extended formalism is considered; we analyze the profiles of the non-equilibrium pressure and temperature as the functions of guiding parameters introduced phenomenologically.
