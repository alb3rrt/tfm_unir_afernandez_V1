## Abstract

Based on the similarity between the chiral nanotube and the classical solenoid, we study chiral transport along the circumferential direction in a carbon nanotube. We calculate the chiral conductivity, representing a circumferential current induced by an electric field along the nanotube axis for various chiralities of carbon nanotubes. We find that the chiral conductivity in a chiral nanotube is in general non zero, and oscillates as a function of the Fermi energy. This oscillating behavior is attributed to the subband structure of the nanotubes and the warping of the Fermi surfaces.
