Many biological processes discriminate correct and incorrect substrates through the kinetic proofreading mechanism which enables lower error at the cost of higher energy dissipation. Although it is apparently beneficial for the organisms to reduce both error and energy cost of the discrimination process, it remains unclear to what extent these two quantities can be minimized simultaneously. Here, with a chemical kinetic formalism, we identify a fundamental error-cost bound which tightly constrains the system's performance under any parameter variations preserving the rate discrimination between substrates. The analytic form of bound is obtained in a large class of proofreading networks and supported by numeric sampling. Furthermore, this bound is kinetically controlled, i.e. completely determined by the difference between the transition state energies of corresponding enzymatic reactions on the free energy landscape. The importance of the bound is analyzed for three biological processes. DNA replication by T7 DNA polymerase is shown to be nearly optimized, i.e. its kinetic parameters place it in the immediate proximity of the error-cost bound. The isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) of E. coli also operates close to the bound, but further optimization is prevented by the need for reaction speed. On the contrary, speed requirement forces E. coli ribosome to operate in a high-dissipation regime. Together, these findings establish a fundamental relation between error and energy cost in biological proofreading networks and provide a theoretical framework for studying error-dissipation trade-off in other systems with biological discrimination.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
Kinetic proofreading is a nonequilibrium mechanism widely used to maintain high fidelity in biological processes such as DNA replication, transcription, and translation. The mechanism increases the accuracy in choosing the correct substrates against the incorrect ones but dissipates energy. A trade-off between error and energy dissipation prevents biological systems from minimizing both in evolution. In this study, we found a fundamental lower bound for error and energy cost in a large class of kinetic proofreading networks and elucidate the condition for a network to optimize error and cost to the maximal extent. The bound is a manifestation of the kinetic control of steady-state fluxes in nonequilibrium systems. Biological implications of the result are illustrated for three distinct biological processes.
INTRODUCTION
The remarkable fidelity in cellular information processing, including DNA replication [1], transcription [2], and translation [3, 4], is realized through a nonequilibrium error-reduction mechanism called kinetic proofreading [5, 6]. The proofreading process is dissipative as it introduces an extra energy cost in exchange for improved discrimination against the incorrect product for-

mation [7]. Besides error and energy dissipation, the reaction speed constitutes another important property of the proofreading system, shown to be optimized in processes such as replication and translation [8­11]. The interplay among speed, accuracy, and energy dissipation in systems involving kinetic proofreading (KPR) has been studied in different contexts [8, 9, 12­25], providing insights to both general KPR networks and specific biological systems achieving discrimination through KPR.
However, recent studies on the steady-state fluxes of biochemical reaction networks have revealed a fundamental difference between speed and the other two properties [23]. Namely, both error and dissipation (per product formed) can be expressed as ratios of steady-state fluxes and thereby only depend on the energy barriers (maxima) of the underlying free energy landscape. In contrast, speed is characterized by the magnitude of the product-forming flux, which depend on the energy levels of both barriers and discrete states (maxima and minima). Therefore, it is expected that error and dissipation are bounded by a fundamental trade-off related to the variation of energy barriers, while the possibility of varying discrete state energy decouples speed from this tradeoff. Elucidating which property among all the features that differ between cognate and noncognate substrates, determines the fundamental error-dissipation bound, is of great importance to the fundamental mechanistic understanding of KPR.

2

Besides theoretical significance, the need to quantitatively understand experimentally characterized KPR systems also necessitates the investigation of the errordissipation bound. Specifically, the trade-offs between speed, error, dissipation, and noise in KPR systems have been studied locally, i.e. by examining the change in these characteristic properties due to the variation of a certain rate constant [8, 9]. However, different reaction steps may have different priorities in the optimization of characteristic properties. In the KPR network of tRNAIle aminoacylation, for instance, the amino acid activation step optimizes speed, but the amino acid transfer step optimizes dissipation [22]. A more global approach which examines the effect of simultaneously varying multiple rate constants might be better equipped to understand the evolutionary principle and consequence in the placement of the rate constants. This approach reveals a global error-dissipation constraint which illustrates the importance of minimizing the energy cost in tRNAIle aminoacylation [22] and coronavirus genome replication [26]. The error-dissipation constraint defines a manifold along which the decrease in error will lead to increase in energy cost and vice versa. In this sense, it is reminiscent of the concept of the Pareto front in phenotype space due to natural selection [27]. However, much remains unknown about this constraint including its physical origin and biological importance. Although the relation between error and dissipation has been studied, for example, under the condition of dissociationbased discrimination [17, 18, 25] or with graph-based asymptotic analysis [19], it was unclear whether these relations correspond to a fundamental bound and how they generalize to biologically relevant regimes where disparity in rate constants is not limited to dissociation steps [4, 11, 28].
In this work, we seek to address these challenges by developing a unified understanding of the fundamental error-dissipation trade-off in general KPR networks. We show that the error-dissipation constraint found in the parameter sampling of real KPR networks is in fact the same fundamental error-dissipation bound expected from the landscape theory, and that they should be studied in conjunction. To this end, a theoretical framework is developed with a three-pronged approach unifying the perspectives of chemical kinetics, reaction fluxes, and free energy landscape. The KPR process is described by the steady-state of a chemical reaction network governed by chemical master equations (CME), which can be explicitly transformed into a flux-based formalism enabling the derivation of the exact error-dissipation bound. The bound strictly encapsulates all possible systems, and it can only be approached in the presence of strong nonequilibrium driving in the proofreading cycle and with the fine-tuning of certain flux-splitting ratios. From the landscape perspective, the bound is only determined by the difference of energy barriers between cognate and noncog-

nate networks, indicating that the trade-off is under kinetic rather than thermodynamic control [24].
The error-dissipation bound derived here is applicable to KPR networks with arbitrary discrimination factors and multiple proofreading pathways, which is demonstrated in three examples whose reaction networks were previously characterized: DNA replication by T7 DNA polymerase, aminoacyl-tRNA selection by E. coli ribosome [8], and aminoacylation by E. coli isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) [22]. The global parameter sampling confirms that the error-dissipation bound is valid in these systems and that the nonequilibrium driving provided by hydrolyzing energy-rich molecules in the futile cycles is indeed sufficiently large, allowing for the bound to be closely approached. By comparing the native systems with the optimal ones that sit on the error-dissipation bound, we search for general constraints and principles in these biological discrimination systems.

METHODS

Error and cost in Hopfield's kinetic proofreading scheme

In the classic proofreading scheme proposed by Hopfield [5], the free enzyme E can either bind to the correct substrate (R) forming the cognate complex ER or bind to the incorrect substrate (W) forming EW. The complex then enters an intermediate state ER* or EW*, where it can either generate a product PR/W or undergo proofreading, i.e. resetting without generate any product. Both proofreading and product formation return the enzyme to the unbound state E. This reaction scheme is shown in Fig. 1A. The networks for right and wrong substrates are identical in structure but differ in reaction rates (highlighted in red). In Hopfield's scheme, such difference only exists in dissociation steps, where the rate for the wrong substrate is f -fold larger than the rate for the right substrate.
The state of the enzyme at any time t is characterized by a probability distribution vector P(t) = [PE, PER, PEW, PER , PEW ]T , where PA denotes the probability of staying in state A. The probabilities are normalized by 1T · P = 1. The time evolution of the probability distribution is governed by the chemical master equation (CME):

j. Specifically, we study the properties of the system at steady state, which satisfies K · P = 0 and 1T · P = 1.
The steady-state properties of the reaction network can be quantified with two key (dimensionless) properties: error  and proofreading energy cost C. Error is defined as the rate of forming the incorrect product P W divided by the rate of forming the correct product P R:

 = JW ,

(3)

JR

where JR = kpPER and JW = kpPEW are the probability fluxes of forming a correct/incorrect product, respectively. Another important property is the steadystate dissipation (entropy production) rate, which could be characterized by the cost C. The total energy dissipation per correct product formed is given by [9, 29, 30]:

 = 0 + C(1 + )µfutile,

(4)

where 0 = R +W is the (fixed) energy cost of making the products and µfutile is the chemical potential difference for the (futile) proofreading cycles, usually corresponding to the hydrolysis of energy-rich molecules such as nucleotide triphosphate (NTP). C is number of futile hydrolysis reactions per any product formed, calculated by taking the ratio of the total (futile) proofreading flux to the total product formation flux (including both cognate and noncognate products) [8, 13]

C

=

Jfutile JR + JW

,

(5)

For example, the futile flux in the Hopfield scheme is

Jfutile = (k3PER - k-3PE) + (k3f PEW - k-3PE). (6)

Since 0 and µfutile are usually fixed by the chemical potential of substrates, products, and other molecules involved in the futile cycle, the interplay between accuracy and energy dissipation of the proofreading network can be studied by directly investigating the relation between dimensionless numbers C and . Before analysing their relation, however, we generalize their definitions to other proofreading networks.

Generalizing proofreading schemes
The reaction scheme in Fig. 1A suffers from a few limitations. First, the difference in reaction rates is only present in dissociation steps, while experiment data suggests that disparity in rate constants can exist in any step of the reaction scheme [4, 11, 28, 31­34]. Second, the Hopfield scheme allows for only one proofreading pathway that resets the enzyme, yet many biological systems, such as isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, involve multiple proofreading pathways [31]. To address these limitations, we study the interplay between error and cost

in a generalized scheme which has n proofreading pathways and allows for rate discrimination in all reactions (Fig. 1B). The discrimination factors are highlighted in red with fi denoting the ratio of rates in step i. As before, the error  is defined as the ratio of the flux forming the incorrect product to that forming the correct product, and the cost C is defined as the ratio of the total proofreading flux to the total product formation flux. Here the chemical potential difference is the same for all proofreading pathways, and the energy dissipation rate is still given by Eq. 4.
In particular, we consider a direct generalisation of the Hopfield scheme in which n proofreading pathways coexist, but the rate discrimination is still limited to dissociation steps with the same factor f . The generalized scheme, which we name the "n-stage scheme

4

with dissociation-based discrimination" (n-stage DBD in short), has the same network structure as Fig. 1B with discrimination factors given by:

f-1 = f3 = f5 = · · · = f2n+1 = f > 1,

(7)

and other reactions carry no discrimination factor. Rich theoretical insights obtained from studying this scheme would be extended to networks which allow for different discrimination factor in all reactions, including those describing real biological proofreading processes.

Parameter Sampling
The parameter sampling (perturbation) is performed by varying the rate constants {k} with fixed discrimination factors {f }, which is the ratio of a rate constant in the noncognate network to the rate of the corresponding reaction in the cognate network. Fixing the discrimination factors is equivalent to maintaining the same energy barrier differences between cognate and noncognate reactions, thus exerting the same level of kinetic control on substrate discrimination as the original (unperturbed) system. Assuming that the cognate and noncognate energy barriers correspond the enzyme in the same conformational state interacting with the respective substrates, perturbation to the enzyme structure would introduce variation to both barriers by the same amount, thus maintaining the same discrimination factor. This is motivated by commonly assumed a Linear Free Energy Relationship between the cognate and noncognate reactions [35, 36].

RESULTS
Minimal energy cost in Hopfield's proofreading scheme
Fig. 1C depicts the relation between error and energy cost in the prototypical Hopfield model (Fig. 1A) with rate constants k randomly sampled from [10-5, 105] and the discrimination factor f kept constant. Each black point represents the error  and cost C of a distinct combination of rate constants {k}. We find all of the points constrained above a boundary (red line), which effectively defines Pareto front where no further improvement in error without compromising the cost is possible. Along the boundary, cost decreases monotonically with error, ranging from zero at eq = f -1 to infinity at min = f -2. This is consistent with the previous finding that dissipative proofreading is only necessary if the error needs to be reduced below the equilibrium value f -1, but the error can never be suppressed below f -2 [5, 6]. We focus on the exact relation between error and cost in the dis-

sipative proofreading regime   (min, eq), where the proofreading mechanism becomes necessary.
To aid the mathematical analysis of the error-cost bound, we introduce a flux-based formalism which changes the primary variables of the chemical master equation (CME) from the probability of each states ({PA}, where A labels all possible enzyme states) to the probability fluxes normalized by the correct-productforming flux. Fig. 2A illustrates the flux-based formalism of the Hopfield scheme. In the correct half of the network, the normalized fluxes are given by ji = Ji/JR (i = ±1, ±2) and ±1 = J±3/JR, where Ji is the probability flux of reaction step i and JR = kpPR is the probability flux of forming the right product. To quantify the normalized probability fluxes in the incorrect network, we define an additional error rate 0 as the ratio of the forward fluxes from EW (ER) to EW (ER):

We refer to 0 as the zeroth stage error rate as it is the error measured before the first proofreading step. The resulting expressions for the normalized fluxes in the incorrect network are presented in Fig. 2A with derivation detailed in SI Appendix, Section I. In terms of the normalized fluxes, the energy cost is given by

The steady-state condition K · P = 0 in the CME translates to a set of stationary conditions in the flux formalism, stipulating that each state must have equal

(normalized) fluxes entering and leaving it. The station-
ary conditions impose four independent constraints on variables {j, , }, leaving three degrees of freedom. We
choose 0, j-2, and -1 as free variables with respect to which the cost is minimized. Moreover, 0 is bounded by the equilibrium error rate, namely 0 > eq = f -1, where the minimum is only achieved in the limit of fast
binding and unbinding between the enzyme and the sub-
strate. We discover that the minimum cost is achieved when 0  f -1 and j-2, -1  0 (see SI Appendix, Section I for detailed derivation):

Cmin(, f )

(10)

which exactly bounds all data points found in numeric
sampling (Fig. 1C, red line). Notably, as  decreases within the range   (f -2, f -1), the cost Cmin increases monotonically and exhibits a divergence at the minimum
error. This can be compared with the error-cost bound
in multi-stage proofreading schemes, where the cost di-
verges much faster toward a smaller error minimum.
The conditions for minimizing the cost reveals how the
probability fluxes should be arranged for the scheme to
be energetically optimal without impairing the accuracy. The first condition, 0 = f -1, indicates that the reactions between E, ER, and EW are in fast equilibrium. Hence,
the ratio of probabilities PEW and PER is determined by the ratio of their respective association constants with the enzyme, which is f -1. In many biochemical systems,
the first step correspond to the binding between enzyme
and substrates, which is indeed in fast equilibrium com-
pared to the subsequent catalytic reactions. The second condition, j-2  0, indicates that this reverse flux only increases the energy dissipation. To better under-
stand it, let us imagine a perturbation redirecting j-2 to forming the correct product and j-2 to forming the incorrect product. This perturbation will not change the
error rate since j-2/j-2 = . The stationary conditions also remain unaffected since the product forming fluxes
return to the free enzyme state, which is in fast equi-
librium with states ER and EW. In this way, however,
we have generated more products without increasing the
futile fluxes and thereby reduced the cost. Therefore,
vanishing fluxes j-2 and j-2 is always energetically favorable. The third condition -1  0 deals with the reverse proofreading fluxes. Although these fluxes seem
to reduce the dissipation, they also significantly increase the error: going directly from E to ER*/EW* introduces
error -1/-1 = 1, which is always higher than the error j2/j2 = 0 from going through intermediate states ER/EW. The condition of vanishing -1 indicates that the reduction in dissipation due to reverse proofreading is
outweighed by the increase in forward proofreading fluxes
needed to mitigate the increase in error.
To summarize, the optimal proofreading system con-
sists of three independent steps: first, the error is re-

activation step (from ER/EW to ER/EW) which is

almost irreversible; third, the error is reduced from 0

to  with a proofreading mechanism that is also almost

irreversible. Note that the activation and proofreading

steps cannot be strictly irreversible due to the thermody-

namic constraint  = (k1k2k3)/(k-1k-2k-3). However,

this constraint only increase the minimum cost by a small

correction term of the order -1/2 (see SI Appendix, Sec-

tion I ), which is usually negligible in real networks since

 1 (for instance,  = e20 in the DNA replication

network).

reading is the partition ratio of proofreading over product

Under the optimal setting, the ratio decreases monotonically with , indicating one-to-one monotonic correspondence between the optimal proofreading intensity and the desired accuracy. Networks that are non-optimal always have a larger partition ratio compared to the optimal network with the same error rate. The significance of this ratio will be further illustrated in networks with multiple proofreading pathways.

Minimum energy cost in multi-stage schemes with dissociation-based discrimination
The natural generalization of the Hopfield scheme is to have multiple proofreading pathways while still localizing the discrimination to dissociation steps. Hence, we study the so-called n-stage dissociation-based-discrimination (DBD) scheme, with network structure shown in Fig. 1B and discrimination factors given by Eq. 7. By preferentially sampling systems with low error and proofreading cost [37], we identify error-cost boundaries for systems with different number of proofreading pathways n (Fig. 1D). For each system, the minimum dissipation starts from zero at eq = f -1 and increases as the error decreases before diverging to infinity at min = f -n-1. The same minimum error has also been obtained with a graph theoretic approach [38].
Next, we analyse the error-cost bound in the n-stage DBD scheme with the flux-based formalism (Fig. 2B). For each stage m (m = 1, 2, . . . , n), we define ±m as the normalized forward/backward fluxes and ±m as the normalized proofreading/reverse proofreading fluxes. The m-stage error m is defined as the ratio of the forward flux going from EWm (ERm) to EWm+1 (ERm+1). The final error is  = n. These  characterize how the error is sequentially reduced from 0 = eq to n =  through

n proofreading steps. Similar to the case of the original Hopfield scheme, the normalized fluxes in the noncognate network can be expressed in terms of , , , and f (see SI Appendix, Section II ). Through mathematical induction, we found that the proofreading cost in a n-stage DBD scheme Cn is bounded by:

whose equality condition is -i, -i  0 for i = 1, 2, . . . , n, j-2  0, and 0 = f -1. Effectively, the system is optimal when the binding step is in fast equi-

librium and the chemical reactions towards product for-

mation or proofreading are nearly irreversible. Complete

irreversibility is precluded by the thermodynamic con-

straint, which increases the minimum cost by a correc-

tion term of the order -1/(n+1) (see SI Appendix, Sec-

tion II ). The intermediate error rates {m} characterize the distribution of proofreading burden between differ-

ent reaction stages, which can be further optimized. We

introduce m = m-1/m > 1 to quantify the increase

in accuracy at stage m. These ratios are constrained by

to the expression for minimum energy cost: (also see SI

Indeed, this boundary constraints all points on the error-
cost plane for each n (solid lines, Fig. 1D). In the optimal
scheme, the reduction of error is carried out sequentially by reducing it by a factor of m/m-1 = (f )1/n after each proofreading step. This implies that the bur-
den of correcting errors is evenly distributed across n

proofreading pathways without any preference to early or late pathways. Notably, the minimum cost exhibits n-th order divergence in the limit of minimum error [i.e. Cmin  ( - min)-n], which is much stronger than the first-order divergence in the original Hopfield scheme.
The error-cost trade-off in the n-stage DBD scheme is controlled by two parameters: the discrimination factor f and the number of proofreading pathways n. Increasing either f or n reduces the overall minimum error min = f -n-1 as well as the minimum energy cost at any given error rate (Eq. 13). They correspond to two error-correcting strategies: enhancing the discriminating capability for each individual proofreading pathways or redistributing the burden of error correction to additional pathways. In real biochemical systems, increasing n often requires the enzyme to have multiple reaction/proofreading domains, and the discrimination factor f is determined by the free energy landscape of the underlying biochemical reactions. Here we analyse the kinetic effects and defer the implication in specific biochemical contexts to the Discussion section. Fig. 3A studies the relation between the minimum cost and the discrimination factor f . For any fixed n and , the minimum cost diverges to infinity when f is so small that the system operates near the minimum error and approaches zero when f tends to -1 allowing the system to operate in the equilibrium discrimination regime. In the intermediate error range, however, we find the minimum cost decreasing with f following a power law with exponent 1 + n-1 (see SI Appendix, Section II for derivation). Increasing f in this range results in a non-diminishing return in the decrease of cost. In contrast, although increasing n also reduces the minimum cost, the benefit becomes marginal when n is large, and the minimum cost never decreases to zero even when n tends to infinity (see Fig. 3B). These two effects can be summarized in Fig. 3C which depicts how the minimum cost depends on n and f for a given error rate. The orientation of the (dashed) cost contours demonstrates that the cost decreases with

The optimal scheme is kinetically controlled

The intermediate error rates m in the optimal n-stage DBD system form a geometric series, where each proofreading stages reduces the error by the same factor. This is achieved by a specific combination of rate constants. In particular, each intermediate state in the optimal scheme has the equal ratio of partition between proofreading (resetting to E) and moving forward to the next intermediate state along the product formation pathway:

In fact, this partition ratio reveals how features of the free energy landscape shape the fundamental tradeoff between accuracy and energy dissipation. To illustrate this, we construct a simple kinetic model (Fig. 4A) which elucidates the flux dynamics in optimal multi-stage proofreading networks. The f -fold discrimination due to the fast equilibrium in the binding steps is captured by the two reactions in the blue dashed box, which create a f -1-fold difference in the production of EW1 compared

to ER1. All the subsequent intermediate states are assigned with a reaction rate i (or equivalently a time scale i = -i 1) and a partition ratio a which is identical for all proofreading pathways. We also assign 0 to the initial steps. By allowing for completely irreversible reactions, this model only calculates the leading order term of cost in the large  limit. The steady-state probability distribution of this model is obtained by directly solving the CME (see SI Appendix, Section III ), which reveals that both error  and cost C are completely determined by f and a and independent of all the i (i = 0, 1, . . . , n). As illustrated in Fig. 4B, increasing a continuously from zero to infinity drives the system from the equilibrium discrimination regime with no proofreading cost (eq = f -1 and C = 0) toward the nonequilibrium limit with highest accuracy and diverging cost (  min = f -n-1 and C  +). Varying  has no effect on either error or cost. We also find that the intermediate error rates m forms a geometric series the same way as seen in the n-stage DBD scheme, and eliminating a from the expression of  and C recovers the error-cost bound in Eq. 13. Therefore, the system sits on the optimal error-cost boundary as long as all proofreading stages share the same partition ratio a. Moreover, the ratio a functions as a tuning parameter which only moves the system along the Pareto front of the error-cost trade-off (i.e., theoretical bounds in Fig. 1CD). This relation is depicted in Fig. 4C, where each value of a corresponds to the optimal scheme for a different error rate and all the systems obtained in the previous parameter sampling fall within the grey accessible region above the optimal bound.
It is not a coincidence that both error and cost are determined by the partition ratio a but not rates i. In fact, the deeper explanation lies in the different features of the underlying free energy landscape captured by these rates. Previous work has shown that any quantities that can be expressed as ratios of stationary fluxes, including both  and C, are invariant against perturbation of the energy level of discrete states (minima on the free energy landscape) and only affected by perturbation of the energy barriers (maxima) [23]. Expressing m and a in terms of the energy levels [39], we find:

that KPR is kinetically controlled [24] and highlights the

importance of the partition ratio in both investigating

based method, it can be shown that for a given error rate,
the energy cost C is minimized when the reverse reaction
rates k-1,-2 become vanishing (see SI Appendix, Section IV ). The minimum cost reads:

Networks with arbitrary discrimination factors
To elucidate the biological implications of the errordissipation trade-off studied so far, we need to generalize it to networks which allow for disparity in the rate constants in all reaction steps (Fig. 1B). To illustrate the idea for generalization, we first study the classic Michaelis-Menten scheme with the addition of a resetting reaction (Fig. 5A, henceforth named MM-withproofreading), which could be regarded as a basic building block that makes up more complex proofreading networks (e.g. with multiple proofreading pathways). The resetting cycle is driven by the cycle chemical potential difference µ = kBT ln [k1k2/(k-1k-2)], which allows for increasing accuracy at the cost of energy dissipation. The disparity in reaction rates is quantified by the discrimination factors fi (highlighted in red; i labels the reaction steps), which obey the thermodynamic constraint f1f2 = f-1f-2. Following the previous methodology, we define error  as the ratio of the product formation fluxes and cost C as the sum of the futile fluxes normalized by the total product formation flux.
Before studying the accuracy-energy trade-off, we first identify the parameter regime where dissipative proofreading becomes relevant. The resetting only improves the accuracy when it dissociates EW* more readily than

To examine this bound numerically, we sample all reaction rates in the MM-with-proofreading scheme with fixed discrimination factors and chemical potential. Fig. 5CD presents the sampling results for two different sets of discrimination factors. Consistent with theory, all sampled systems reside above the boundary given by Eq. 16 (red lines). The cost diverges to infinity as the error approaches minimum. Towards the   e-q limit, however, the minimum cost approaches zero in the case of Fig. 5C but converges to a positive value in Fig. 5D. As zero proofreading cost is expected in the equilibrium regime ( > eq), the discontinuity in Fig. 5D indicates a sudden change of the optimal rate configuration during the transition from the nonequilibrium regime to the equilibrium regime. In the absence of proofreading, the minimum error is achieved by making either k1 or kp rate-limiting, which leads to error rates of  = f1 or  = f1fp/f-1, respectively. eq corresponds to the more accurate one of these two configurations. In the optimal scheme in the nonequilibrium regime, nonetheless, the rate k-1 is always vanishing as seen in the cost minimization condition derived above. Hence, there is a discontinuous regime change if fp < f-1, where the k±1 step is in fast equilibrium on the equilibrium side and almost irreversibly driven forward on the nonequilibrium side, resulting in the discontinuous error-cost relation as seen

9

in Fig. 5D. If fp  f-1, however, k-1 is vanishing on

both sides of eq, and the error-cost bound is continuous

at eq, which is the case in Fig. 5C. This regime change is a feature present only in networks whose rate discrimina-

tion is not limited to dissociation steps. Other than the

discontinuity at eq, the error-cost bound has the same quantitative profile as the original Hopfield scheme.

It is remarkable that out of all the discrimination fac-

tors, the error-cost relation (Eq. 16) is only controlled

by f1 and the ratio f2/fp. This can be understood from the perspective of free energy landscape (Fig. 5B), where

previous analysis has shown that both error and cost are

determined solely by the energy barriers. We denote the

energy barriers by

Moreover, the

the relevant features of the energy landscape. Next, we

apply this technique to three real proofreading systems

with parameters provided in previous studies [8, 9, 22]

and discuss biological implications.

Error-cost trade-off in real biological networks
To illustrate the robustness of the bound, we apply our theoretical framework to three real biological proofreading networks, where numeric sampling confirms that the bound formulated with our theory tightly constrains the error and cost of all systems sampled. The position of the native systems compared to the bound reveals the relative importance in the evolutionary optimization of functionalities including speed, accuracy, and dissipation in KPR systems.
We start with DNA replication by T7 DNA polymerase, which employs a one-cycle proofreading mechanism [8, 10]. Its reaction network is similar to the MMwith-proofreading scheme with the addition of one more intermediate state in the proofreading step. Since the proofreading step is irreversible at the bound, the presence of this intermediate state does not affect the va-

lidity of the error-cost bound given in Eq. 16 (see SI Appendix, Section V for details). Fig. 6A presents the result of sampling all rate constants while fixing the discrimination factors. Indeed, all the sampled systems fall exactly above the theoretical bound outlined by the red line. Notably, the native system (green diamond) resides close to the boundary. The energy cost C for the native system is only 4.3% larger than the minimum possible cost at the native error rate, which means that only a small portion of futile hydrolysis is excessive. The energy efficiency of the DNA polymerase could also be assessed by the proofreading-to-product-formation partition ratio a = k2/kp = 8 × 10-4, which is close to its minimum possible value amin = 4.5 × 10-4 for the optimal system at the native error rate. In analogy to the original Hopfield scheme, the DNAP network approaches the error-cost bound by driving both polymerization and proofreading irreversibly forward. Indeed, we find the forward/backward polymerization rate ratio to be k1/k-1 = 250 1, and the rate ratio in proofreading to be (k2k3)/(k-2k-3) = 2 × 106 1. These reactions are driven forward by the nonequilibrium driving µ = 20kBT in the futile cycle, which comes from hydrolyzing one dNTP molecule. Going below the native error rate, the system has the potential of reducing the error by more than two orders of magnitude (from 10-8 to 10-10). However, this will lead to about one futile hydrolysis per product formed (C  1), effectively doubling the total energy dissipation of DNA replication. It has chosen not to reduce the error further in order to avoid the inevitable increase in energy cost which is unfavorable for its overall fitness.
Next, we consider the aminiacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) selection process by ribosome during translation [8, 40]. This network also has only one proofreading pathway, and the error-cost bound is fully captured by Eq. 16 with f1 replaced by the minimum error achievable in steps prior to proofreading and f2 replaced by the discrimination in the proofreading step in this network (see SI Appendix, Section V for details). As shown in Fig. 6B, the bound (red line) exactly encapsulates all sampled systems on the error-cost plane. The vertical part of the bound indicates the minimum error for equilibrium discrimination eq, above which proofreading becomes unnecessary and the minimum cost is zero. Unexpectedly, the native system resides within this equilibrium regime, seemingly suggesting that the proofreading mechanism is redundant. The error-cost trade-off has also been analysed for the error-prone and hyperaccurate mutants of the ribosome [40], whose native error rates are also larger than eq (see SI Appendix, Section V ). Although the sampling results suggest that it is theoretically possible to maintain the same error rate without any proofreading, its feasibility in real translation networks remains to be examined. In the absence of proofreading, the error is minimized when kp is much smaller than all other reactions, i.e. the

product formation step is rate limiting. The rate kp corresponds to the accommodation of the aa-tRNA into the A site of the large subunit and the subsequent peptidyltransfer. Experiment measurements, however, found kp comparable to the rate of preceding reactions [40]. It is three-fold smaller than the GTP hydrolysis rate and five-fold smaller than the codon recognition step. This is far from the theoretical condition of rate-limiting kp. In fact, a simple numeric experiment can be conducted where both forward and backward proofreading reactions are removed (k±2 = 0) and kp is decreased to compensate for the increase in error, while all other rates remain invariant. We find that kp needs to be decreased 700-fold to recover the native error rate (9 × 10-4) and even further decrease is needed for smaller error rates. Such decrease will significantly slow down the rate of product formation. Therefore, such error rates which are realizable in theory are actually infeasible since the large decrease in the protein synthesis rate would be detrimental to the normal growth and functioning of the cell. Although increasing the time scale of both codon recognition and GTP hydrolysis has the same effect as reducing kp, a large amplification in those rates would also be unrealistic. Therefore, the low equilibrium error rate permissible

in the theoretical framework is kinetically prohibited in the actual translation process. The proofreading mechanism is still necessary in the native system, contributing to a 20-fold increase in the translation fidelity [40]. The above analysis indicates that the minimum dissipation for protein translation is limited by the speed constraints rather than the error-cost trade-off.
To extend our analysis to multi-stage proofreading networks, we study the reaction network for Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) in E. coli [22]. The enzyme pairs tRNAIle with the cognate amino acid isoleucine (Ile) by discriminating it against a chemically similar amino acid, valine (Val) [31]. The network has the structure of Fig. 1B with n = 3 proofreading stages. The errorcost bound could be derived by generalizing the bound in MM-with-proofreading scheme with the mathematical induction method used in the n-stage DBD scheme (see SI Appendix, Section V ). Fig. 6C presents the errorcost relation due to the rates sampling, demonstrating that all systems sampled fall above the theoretical errorcost bound. The native system falls within the nonequilibrium discrimination regime (i.e.  < eq). Similar to T7 DNA polymerase, the enzyme resides close to the boundary, whose cost is 2.6-fold of the minimum cost required to maintain the same error rate. In terms of the energy dissipated per Ile-tRNAIle formed (W ), the optimal system corresponds to a 17% reduction in energy dissipation compared to the native system. This finding analytically reaffirms that IleRS is energetically efficient [22].
The reason why the dissipation could not be further reduced could be explained by analysing the optimal schemes corresponding to the bound. In contrast to the n-stage DBD scheme where all proofreading pathways are equally leveraged, the IleRS network has three different proofreading regimes characterized by different number of "effective" proofreading pathways with nonzero proofreading fluxes. To understand this, we calculate the optimal partition ratios a1,2,3 as a function of error  (see Fig. 6D). The full error range   (min, eq) can be categorized into three phases (represented by different shades in Fig. 6D) by the number of nonzero partition ratios. When the error is sufficiently small, all three stages need to be functional (yellow phase, n = 3). Due to the different discrimination factor, however, the partition ratios are different among the three stages. The post-transfer proofreading pathway, which has the most discrimination, has the largest partition ratio a3. Conversely, the first pre-transfer proofreading pathway has the smallest partition ratio a1. These partition ratios decrease as the error is increased until a threshold (left black dashed line) is reached where a1  0. Further increase in error leads to a negative a1, which is prohibited since the rate constants are always positive. Negative a1 is also thermodynamically impossible since all proofreading pathways have the same nonequilibrium driving

11

 which precludes coexistence of proofreading and antiproofreading in different pathways (otherwise there will be cyclic flux on a reaction loop with no driving). Therefore, the first pre-transfer proofreading pathway is turned off (namely a1 = 0) for error larger than this threshold. Similarly, there is a second threshold (right black dashed line) where a2  0 , turning off the second pre-transfer proofreading pathway. The optimal system effectively operates in a two-stage proofreading regime for error rates between the two thresholds (green phase, n = 2) and in a one-stage regime for error larger than the second threshold (blue phase, n = 1). The native system (red diamond) resides in the one-stage regime where the optimal scheme utilizes only the post-transfer proofreading mechanism. The native partition ratios a1 and a2 are indeed negligibly small, while the native a3 is about two-fold of its optimal value, accounting for the increased cost. The increased a3 can in fact be attributed to steps before proofreading, where the actual error rate is about twice of the minimum error eq. Reducing this error rate requires decreasing the rate of amino acid activation, which will decrease the speed of product formation. This is consistent with the previous trade-off analysis on the activation rate, which indicated that the reaction optimizes speed over energy dissipation [22]. Therefore, the native IleRS system's deviation from the optimal bound is explained by the speed requirement, which is similar to the case in protein translation. Moreover, the small partition ratios in pre-transfer editing (a1,2) could be a result of selective pressure to reduce the energy dissipation in aminoacylation. It is possible that after the early emergence of the CP1 editing domain which is responsible for post-transfer editing [41], the pre-transfer editing activity (a1,2) evolved to decrease, allowing errors to be corrected more efficiently in post-transfer editing (a3).
DISCUSSION
The error-dissipation trade-off is kinetically controlled
In this work, we analyse the error and energy cost of kinetic proofreading in a large class of reaction networks whose dynamics are governed by the chemical master equation (CME). To derive the error-cost lower bound, we propose a formalism whereby the probability fluxes replace the probability distribution among discrete states as the primary variables of interest. The flux-based formalism complements the CME formalism and provides a useful mathematical device for understanding the flux kinetics in reaction networks, especially those with symmetric and branching structures. On the other hand, the chemical transitions in the reaction network are fundamentally governed by the underlying free energy landscape, which turns out to be crucial for understanding the

trade-off between accuracy and energy dissipation in ki-

netic proofreading. Both error  and cost C are expressed

as the ratio of steady-state fluxes, which have been shown

to depend only on the energy barriers rather than the

energy levels of discrete states [23]. More precisely, the

energy barriers determine error and cost through the par-

tition ratio a. Having uniform partition ratios in different

proofreading stages is necessary for optimizing the error-

cost relation in the n-stage DBD scheme, and the magni-

tude of the partition ratio determines the extent to which

error or dissipation is prioritized in their trade-off. In the

minimal multi-stage proofreading scheme (Fig. 4A), it is

further demonstrated that the energy level of discrete

states is irrelevant to both error and cost, and that the

uniform partition ratio parameterizes the system's posi-

tion along the error-cost bound (Fig. 4C).

These theoretical analyses suggest experimental char-

acterization of reaction fluxes rather than the rate con-

stants as an important way to understand the kinetics

of networks involving proofreading or similar branching

structures. Moreover, any properties that involve only

the ratio of stationary fluxes, such as error and cost stud-

ied here, are fully characterized with the knowledge of

energy barriers, which are, in turn, fully captured by the

partition ratio of fluxes without knowing all the reaction

rates.

The significance of transition state energy is further

elucidated in MM-with-proofreading scheme. It is shown

that while the energy barriers ( ,R/W) affect error and

cost, the difference of energy barriers between the correct

and

incorrect

networks

(

 

)

fully

determines

the

funda-

mental error-cost bound. More precisely, the energy bar-

rier difference corresponds to the free energy difference

between cognate and noncognate substrates interacting

with the enzyme in the same conformational state, which

would be invariant under perturbations to the enzyme

structure if a linear free energy relationship is assumed.

The rate sampling is equivalent to perturbing the energy

landscape without affecting the energy barrier difference, and the networks are optimized in the sense of tuning  with fixed  . While the energy difference of discrete

states are well characterized, for example, by the ratio

of association constants, it is more difficult to determine

the difference of energy barriers both experimentally and

computationally. A system-specific molecular dynamic

analysis of the transition state configuration might be useful to account for the barrier difference of  , which

is the key to understanding how a specific biological dis-

crimination process is kinetically controlled.

Constraints and strategies in real proofreading systems
The error-cost bound obtained in this work has several implications. First, it is now clear that the minimum er-

12

ror rate is associated with the divergence of energy dissipation rate, which could never be reached. This rationalizes findings in previous studies that several biological proofreading systems are capable of achieving error rates much lower than their native values [8, 9, 22]. Second, the multi-stage proofreading schemes reveals two approaches of reducing the cost at a given error: increasing the discrimination capacity of each proofreading pathway (f ) or the number of proofreading pathways (n). In biological systems, however, the values of f and n are upper bounded by various constraints. f is constrained by the difference in transition state energies, and n is limited since introducing new proofreading pathways requires the enzyme to have either additional conformational states or dedicated domains for proofreading, such as the editing site in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases [31, 42]. Depending on the biochemical structure as well as the functional purpose of the enzyme, one of the two constraints might be predominantly challenging to circumvent, resulting in the enzyme preferentially adopting the alternate strategy to reduce the energy cost of proofreading. However, the analysis in the multi-stage DBD scheme demonstrates that increasing n leads to a diminishing benefit of cost reduction compared to increasing f . This suggests that proofreading with fewer pathways and larger discrimination factors is favorable to proofreading with numerous pathways and small discrimination factors, potentially accounting for the rarity of multi-stage proofreading in nature.
The general applicability of our theoretical framework is demonstrated in three real biological proofreading networks. Surprisingly, the three systems seem to operate in different regimes. The DNA polymerase resides remarkably close to the error-dissipation bound, demonstrating high energy efficiency in DNA replication. In contrast, the ribosome is unable to optimize its energy dissipation, possibly as a consequence of maximizing speed. IleRS operates relatively close to the error-dissipation bound, but further optimization also seems to be prohibited by speed requirements. Therefore, although speed is in theory decoupled from the error-dissipation trade-off, it still plays an important role in the evolutionary trade-offs among characteristic properties due to realistic limitations to which biochemical reactions can be accelerated. The theoretical optimal scheme requires the binding and unbinding reactions to be much faster than the subsequent reaction. In reality, however, such time scale separation is not always possible since the binding/unbinding rates are upper-bounded by processes such as diffusion and substrate recognition, and the rate of the subsequent reaction is lower-bounded by the minimum overall reaction speed.
Finally, our work provides a general framework of analysing the error-dissipation trade-off in biochemical reaction networks capable of achieving high fidelity with nonequilibrium proofreading. The framework does not

require full knowledge of the reaction network since the error-cost bound could be determined as soon as a few key discrimination factors are measured. Further insights could be revealed by subjecting the energy barrier differences, which exert the key kinetic control on both error and dissipation, to a more detailed and specific molecular dynamics or experimental investigation. It would also be important to see the implication of the error-cost bound for other biological systems involving proofreading.

I. FLUX-BASED FORMALISM OF THE ORIGINAL HOPFIELD SCHEME
This section provides the detailed derivation of the results for the original Hopfield scheme (Fig. 1A in main text), including the flux-based formalism (Fig. 2A) and the error-cost bound. We also consider how finite  introduces a small increase to the minimum energy cost.

A. Deriving the normalized steady-state fluxes for the flux-based formalism

As shown in Fig. 2A in the main text, the normalized fluxes in the correct half of the network are denoted by j±1, j±2, and ±1. The normalized fluxes in the incorrect half of the network are denoted by their primed counterparts, which we shall derive in terms of the correct fluxes.
First, the (normalized) fluxes originating from the free enzyme E are given by

j1

=

k1PE JR

=

j1,

-1

=

k-3PE JR

=

-1,

(S1)

which are exactly equal to their counterparts in the correct half of the network. As mentioned in the main text, an additional error rate 0 is defined as the ratio of the flux from EW to EW to the flux from ER to ER:

0

=

k2PEW k2PER

=

k2PEW JR

JR k2PER

=

j2 j2

.

(S2)

Hence we have j2 = j20. In addition, j-1 can be related to j-1 through j2:

j-1 j2

=

f k-1 k2

=

f

j-1 j2

= j-1

=

f j-1

j2 j2

= f 0j-1.

(S3)

Following the same line of thinking, the (normalized) fluxes originating from the activated state EW are given by:

jp =

kpPEW JR

=

JW JR

= ,

j-2

=

k-2PEW JR

=

k-2 kp

jp

k-2PER kpPER

yp

k3PER kpPER

= f 1,

(S4) (S5) (S6)

where jp =  was the normalized flux for incorrect formation directly given in Fig. 2A. Thus, all expressions given in the box in Fig. 2A have been derived.

B. Deriving the error-cost bound

The stationary conditions for the fluxes for states ER, EW, ER*, and EW* are:

j1 + j-2 = j-1 + j2, j2 + -1 = j-2 + 1 + 1, j1 + j-2 = f 0j-1 + 0j2, 0j2 + -1 = j-2 + f 1 + .

(S7) (S8) (S9) (S10)

The stationary condition for E is guaranteed if the stationary conditions for all other states are satisfied. From
the first two equations, we eliminate j±2 and find j1 - j-1 = 1 - -1 + 1. From the last two equations, we find j1 - f 0j-1 = f 1 - -1 + . Subtracting these two relations yields

(f 0 - 1)j-1 = (1 - ) + (1 - f )1.

(S11)

Since the normalized fluxes are positive by definition and the error we consider falls within the range  < f -1 < 1 (error rates larger than f -1 can be achieved without any proofreading), the right hand side (RHS) must be positive.

S3

Thus, the left hand side (LHS) is also positive, leading to 0 > f -1. Indeed, 0 only approaches its minimum f -1 in the limit j-1  +. j1 would also diverge to infinity in this limit, which corresponds to the fast equilibrium condition in the j±1 step.
Recall the cost (Eq. 9 in main text):

C

=

(1

+

f )1 - 1+

2-1 .

(S12)

From the second and fourth stationary condition:

1

=

j2

j-2

1

=

[0j2

-

j-2

+ -1

- ]



j2

=

(f

- 1)(1 + j-2) + (1 - f - 0

f )-1 .

Thus, 1 can be eliminated from the expression for the cost:

C

=

(1

(S13) (S14)

which

only

depends

on

0,

and

Since



< f -1

< 0,

the

coefficients

(0-)(1+f ) (1+)(f -0)

and

(1+0)(1-f ) (1+)(f -0)

are

both

positive. The cost decreases monotonically with 0, j-2 and -1. The cost is minimized in the limit:

0  f -1, j-2  0, -1  0.

(S15)

The minimum cost reads

Cmin

=

(f-1 - )(1 + f ) (1 + )(f - f -1)

=

(1

1 - 2f2 + )(f 2 -

1)

,

(S16)

which gives Eq. 10 in the main text. In the optimal system, other fluxes are given by the stationary condition:

j2

=

f (f f 2

- -

1) 1

,

1

=

1- f 2

f -1

,

j±1  +.

(S17)

C. Effect of the thermodynamic constraint

Reaching the minimum cost derived above requires vanishing j-2 and -1. Namely, these two reactions need to be irreversible. However, complete irreversibility is impossible due to the thermodynamic constraint:



= eµfutile

=

k1k2k3 k-1k-2k-3

=

j1j21 j-1j-2-1

,

(S18)

where µfutile is the chemical potential difference for the futile cycle. For finite , the fluxes j-2 and -1 are positive, which would cause the minimum cost to increase (i.e. introduce a positive correction term). Since the bound becomes exact at infinite , we shall calculate the positive correction term to the first order in the large  limit. This is also motivated by the fact that  is usually sufficiently large in real biological proofreading networks due to the hydrolysis of energy-rich molecules coupled to the futile cycle.
In the optimal network derived before, the fast equilibrium in the j±1 step leads to j1/j-1  1. Thus, the thermodynamic constraint reduces to j-2-1 = -1j21. The energy cost is

C

=

(0 - )(1 + f ) (1 + )(f - 0)

To obtain the first order correction, we substitute with 0 = f -1 and

where j2 and 1 are evaluated at the infinite  limit. The cost reads

Therefore, the thermodynamic constraint introduces a correction term of order O(-1/2), which is negligible in realistic cases where   e20.

II. FLUX-BASED FORMALISM OF THE n-STAGE DISSOCIATION-BASED-DISCRIMINATION SCHEME
In this section, we establish the flux-based formalism and derive the error-cost bound for the n-stage dissociationbased-discrimination (DBD) scheme. The reaction scheme is illustrated in Fig. 1B of the main text with discrimination factors given in Eq. 7 and related text. The notation for the flux-based formalism is given in Fig. 2B of the main text.

A. Deriving the normalized steady-state fluxes for the wrong half of the network

First, we recall the definition of intermediate error rates m as the forward flux ratio going from EWm (ERm) to EWm+1 (ERm+1):

0 =

f2k2PEW0 k2PER0

=

j2 j2

,

m =

f2m+2k2m+2PEWm k2m+2PERm

=

m m

(m = 1, 2, . . . , n).

(S22)

Since the rate discrimination only appears in dissociation steps, we have f2 = f4 = · · · = f2m+2 = 1. Following the derivation in the original Hopfield scheme, the (normalized) fluxes in the first two steps (i.e. EEW0EW1) are

j1 = j1, j2 = 0j2, j-1 = f 0j-1, j-2 = 1j-2.

(S23) (S24)

Next, we consider the fluxes associated with the m-th intermediate state ERm/EWm, which are given by

m = mm,

-(m-1)

=

k-2mPEWm k2m+2PEWm

m

=

-(m-1) m

m

=

m-(m-1),

m

=

f k2m+1PEWm k2m+2PEWm

m

=

f

m m

m

=

f mm,

-m = -m.

(S25) (S26)
(S27) (S28)

For the product forming steps, we have n = 1 and n = n = . Thus, we have derived the (normalized) fluxes presented in Fig. 2B for the n-stage DBD scheme.

B. Deriving the error-cost bound

The cost in the n-stage DBD scheme is given by

Cn

m + m - -m - -m

[(1 + mf )m - 2-m],

S5

where {} are the (normalized) stationary fluxes. Due to the stationary conditions, summing up the net proofreading fluxes is equivalent to calculating the difference of the total fluxes coming out of the E (free enzyme) state and the total fluxes that lead to products:

Cn

=

(1 + 0)j2 - (1 + 1+

1)j-2

-

1.

(S30)

To derive the lower bound of [(1 + 0)j2 - (1 + 1)j-2], we first prove the following recursive relation:

m

>

m+1(f - 1) m+1f - m

[m+2

+

-m],

(m = 1, 2, . . . , n - 1)

(S31)

where m =

n k=m

k(f -1) kf -k-1

and

n+1

= 1.

The

equality

condition

for

Eq.

S31

is

-k

=0

for

k

 m+1

and

-k

=0

for k  m. We will also prove the following relation for the error rates:

m+1f > m, (m = 1, 2, . . . , n - 1)

(S32)

The relations Eq. S31 and Eq. S32 are derived inductively via the following steps: · Step 1. For m = n - 1, the stationary conditions for states ERn and EWn read

n-1 - -(n-1) = 1 + n - -n, n-1n-1 - n-(n-1) = n + nf n - -n

(S33) (S34)

where n =  is the final error. Elimination of n yields

(nf - n-1)n-1 = n(f - 1) 1 + -(n-1) + (1 - nf )-n.

(S35)

The coefficient (1 - nf ) is positive since we are considering error  < eq = f -1. Therefore, RHS is positive. On the other hand, n-1 is positive. For LHS to also be positive, we must have

n-1 < nf,

(S36)

which recovers Eq. S32 for m = n - 1. Since -n > 0, we have

(nf - n-1)n-1 > n(f - 1) 1 + -(n-1)



n-1

>

n(f - 1) nf - n-1

(1

+ -(n-1)),

(S37)

which recovers Eq. S31 for m = n - 1 (since n+1 = 1). The equality condition is -n = 0.
· Step 2. For any m = 1, 2, . . . , n - 2, we prove Eq. S31 and Eq. S32 given the condition that they both hold for l = m + 1, i.e.

m+2f > m+1,

m+1



m+2(f - 1) m+2f - m+1

m+3 + -(m+1)

,

where

m+3

=

n k=m+3

k(f - 1) kf - k-1

.

(S38)

Consider the stationary conditions for states ERm+1 and EWm+1

m - -m = m+1 - -(m+1) + m+1 - -(m+1), mm - m+1-m = m+1m+1 - m+2-(m+1) + m+1f m+1 - -(m+1).

(S39) (S40)

Eliminating m+1, we have

(m+1f - m)m = m+1(f - 1)(-m + m+1) + (m+2 - m+1f )-(m+1) + (1 - m+1f )-(m+1). Since -(m+1) > 0 and 1 - m+1f > 0, we obtain the lower bound:
(m+1f - m)m > m+1(f - 1)(-m + m+1) + (m+2 - m+1f )-(m+1).

(S41) (S42)

S6

Plugging in the lower bound for m+1 given in Eq. S38:

(m+1f - m)m > m+1(f - 1)

-m

+

m+2(f - 1) m+2f - m+1

m+3 + -(m+1)

+ (m+2 - m+1f )-(m+1)

= m+1(f - 1)

1)(-m

+

m+2)

+

(m+1 - m+2)2f m+2f - m+1

-(m+1)

> m+1(f - 1)(-m + m+2).

(S43)

Since RHS is positive, LHS must also be positive. Thus we have

m+1f > m.

We can divide both sides by (m+1f - m) which has been shown to be positive. This leads to

m

>

m+1 m+1

(f - 1) f - m

(-m

+ m+2).

(S44) (S45)

As a result of the mathematical induction, Eq. S31 and Eq. S32 holds for m = 1, 2, · · · , n - 1. Specifically, the relation for m = 1 is

1 < f n-1n,

1

>

2(f 2f

- 1) - 1

[3

+

-1].

(S46)

We repeat the same derivation for states EW0 and ER0. The only difference from repeating the above derivation for m = 0 is the notation: ±0 is now replaced by j±2. This gives us

0 < f 1 < f n,

j2

The

coefficient

since

We also recall that error before proofreading

0 > eq = f -1, with the lower bound reached in the limit of fast equilibrium. Therefore, the minimum cost for the

n-stage DBD scheme for given intermediate error rates {m} is

The minimum cost C¯n is reached in the limit

(S49)

-m  0, -m  0, (m = 1, 2, . . . n); j-2  0; 0  eq = f -1.

(S50)

The last condition implies j1/j-1  1 and j±1  +. These were results reported in Eq. 12 of the main text. Next, the minimum cost C¯n can be further optimized with respective to the intermediate error rates {m}. In the
main text, a symmetry argument is used to illustrate that {m} must form a geometric series for the dissipation to be optimized. Here, we provide the mathematical proof that it is indeed the unique minimum of the energy cost. From
Eq. S49, we define

C~n = ln

C¯n + 1

= ln

(S51)

S7

For any fixed error rate , C~n is apparently a monotonically increasing function of C¯n. Hence, finding the minimum energy cost is equivalent to minimizing C~n with respect to variables m (m = 1, 2, . . . , n - 1), which is done by simply taking the derivative:

C~n m

mf

f - m-1

1 m+1f - m

=

f m2 - m+1m-1 m(m+1f - m)(mf -

m-1)

.

(S52)

Setting the first derivative to zero, we get m2 = m+1m-1, i.e. the intermediate error rates indeed form a geometric series. With the first term 0 = f -1 and the last term n = , all the other error rates can be determined as

m = f -1(f )m/n.

(S53)

It can be verified that the optimal error rates satisfy m  f -1m-1, m-1 , which is consistent with Eq. S32. To verify that this solution indeed correspond to a minimum of the cost, we calculate the second derivative:

2C~n m2

(S54)

2f (f )1/n f (f )1/n - 1

2 > 0.

Thus, the solution found above is a minimum of the energy cost. Moreover, it is a global minimum. The minimum cost is given by

Cn,min = C¯n m=f -1(f )m/n =

1 + f -1 (f - 1)n 1+

(S55)

This is the minimum energy cost reported in Eq. 13 in main text.

C. Analysing the minimum cost

The minimum cost (Eq. S55) vanishes in the limit   eq = f -1 but diverges in the limit   min = f -(n+1). Here, we analyse how the minimum cost depends on the discrimination factor f .

In the intermediate error range f -(n+1)  f -1, the numerator is dominated by the first term which is proportional to f -(n+1)/n, and the denominator is approximately 1. Therefore, the minimum cost decreases with f following a power law:

for

More

importantly,

the

power

relation

between the minimum cost and the discrimination factor indicates that increasing f leads to a non-diminishing benefit

in cost reduction (see main text for detailed discussion).

D. Partition between proofreading and catalytic fluxes

The derivation of the minimum energy cost in the above section suggests that in the energetically optimal system, the normalized fluxes in the right half of the network are given by

m = m+1,

m

=

m-1

- m

=

m-1 - m mf - m-1

m+1,

(S58)

where m =

. n

k(f -1)

k=m kf -k-1

On the other hand, these fluxes are related to the steady-state probability PERm ,

reaction rates k2m+1, k2m+2, and the correct product formation flux JR by

The ratio of these two fluxes is

m

=

k2m+2PERm , JR

m

=

k2m+1PERm . JR

(S59)

m m

=

k2m+1 k2m+2

=

m-1 - m mf - m-1

=

1 - (f )1/n f (f )1/n - 1

,

(S60)

which has taken into account the optimal error rates m = f -1(f )m/n. This is the partition ratio given in Eq. 14 in the main text. The reaction rates k2m+1, k2m+2 can be expressed in terms of the energy levels of the discrete states and the energy barriers:

k2m+1 = k20m+1 exp

m-

 m,p

,

k2m+2 = k20m+2 exp

m-

 m,m+1

.

(S61)

k20m+1 and k20m+2 are prefactors independent of the energy levels.

m is the energy level of ERm.

 m,p

and

 m,m+1

is the energy level of the transition state (energy barrier) between ERm and ERm+1. Therefore, the ratio m/m is

actually only related to the difference between the energy level of the two transition states:

m m

=

k2m+1 k2m+2

=

1 - (f )1/n f (f )1/n - 1



exp

 m,m+1

-

.

As discussed in the main text, this is a manifestation of how the error-cost relation is kinetically controlled.

(S62)

E. Effect of the thermodynamic constraints

Similar to the case of the original Hopfield scheme, the thermodynamic constraints prevent any reaction to be completely irreversible and introduces a correction term to the minimum energy cost (Eq. S55) in the n-stage DBD scheme. Here we calculate the leading order contribution of this correction term.
In the derivation of the error-cost bound, many of the fluxes were set to zero since they only increase the overall cost. These terms must be recovered as we study the effect of the thermodynamic constraints. Fortunately, due to the linearity of the stationary conditions, they contribute to the cost through a linear relation:

n-1

n

C = C(j-2, {}, {}) = C0 + a0j-2 + am-m + bm-m,

m=1

m=1

(S63)

S9

where C0 is the minimum cost in Eq. S55. The coefficients ai (i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n - 1) and bi (i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n) are positive functions of f and m (m = 1, 2, . . . , n). Following the inductive method used to derive the bound, we find the following coefficients:

a0

(0 - 1)(1 + 1f ) (1 + )(1f - 0)

ai

(m = 1, 2, . . . n)

(S67)

For any futile cycle, the thermodynamic correction to the energy cost is of the order -1/L, where L is the number of reactions needed to be driven strongly forward in this cycle. This is because the cost always depends on the reverse reaction fluxes, which should vanish without the thermodynamic constraint, in a linear fashion. Thus, in the presence of the thermodynamic constraint, the cost is minimized when those reverse fluxes are of the same order of magnitude, i.e. of order -1/L. Hence, the first order contribution in  comes from the largest futile cycle, which has (n + 1) reaction steps that need to be driven forward. The thermodynamic constraint for this cycle can be reorganized to:

j-2-n

n-1
-m

=

j2n

m=1

m=1

Therefore, the first correction to the cost is calculated as follows:

-1/(n+1) + O(-2/(n+1))

m=1

= C0 + C1-1/(n+1) + O(-1/n).

(S69)

The O(-1/n) term is due to the second largest futile cycle which has length n. The coefficient C1 is given by

C1 = (n + 1)

n-1

a0j2 ·

amm · bnn

m=1

1/(n+1)
,

(S70)

where the coefficients (a0, am, bn) and fluxes (j2, m, n) are evaluated in the optimal scheme, i.e. as if the thermodynamic constraints are not present. Thus, the correction is of the order -1/(n+1). Although the correction term becomes increasingly significant as n is increased, the number of proofreading pathways in real biological systems is usually limited, so the correction term remains small. Moreover, note that the correction term due to thermodynamic constraints is always positive, so the original error-cost bound could never be violated.

III. A SIMPLE KINETIC MODEL FOR n-STAGE PROOFREADING
In this section, we study the n-stage proofreading scheme shown in Fig. 4A by directly solving the Chemical Master Equation (CME). We introduce Pm(t) to denote the probability for state ERm at time t and P-m(t) to denote the

S10

probability for state EWm. The probability for the free enzyme state E is denoted by P0(t). The probabilities are normalized by the condition

which is exactly the dissipation bound for n-stage DBD scheme reported in the main text (Eq. 13). In this simplified model, both error and energy dissipation are modulated by the partition ratio a, which is equivalent
to the flux-splitting ratio m/m in the flux-based formalism calculated above. When a  0, the system approaches the non-dissipative, equilibrium discrimination regime with   eq = f -1 and C  0. When a  , the system approaches the limit to which error can be reduced by dissipative proofreading, namely   min = f -n-1 and C  . Moreover, the system is optimized as long as the partition ratio a is uniform for all proofreading pathways. The continuous tuning of a  (0, ) therefore represents a trade-off between error and dissipation, where error can be reduced by increasing a at the cost of more dissipation.

IV. MICHAELIS-MENTEN SCHEME WITH DISSIPATIVE RESETTING

This section provides detailed derivation of the error-cost relation in the MM-with-proofreading scheme reported in Fig. 5 in the main text. More complex reaction networks can be considered as combination or generalization of this type of reaction network.
The reaction scheme is presented in Fig. S1A with notations introduced in the main text. Due to the kinetic control of both error and energy cost, we introduce a set of variables i to quantify the difference between energy barriers:

1 = f1,

2

=

f1f2 f-1

=

f-2,

p

=

f1fp f-1

=

f-2fp f2

.

(S82)

Their relation with energy barrier differences are reported in Eq. 17 in the main text.
In the absence of proofreading (k±2 = 0), the minimum error is determined by the maximum difference in energy barriers

eq = min (1, p) = f1 min

1,

fp f-1

.

(S83)

The minimum error is achieved by making the step with the largest barrier difference rate-limiting. Namely, kp is rate-limiting if fp < f-1, and k1 is rate-limiting if fp > f-1.
We study the relation between error and energy cost in the parameter regime where the dissipative proofreading
mechanism is relevant, i.e. it could achieve some error rate  < eq which is otherwise inaccessible. The condition for the proofreading mechanism to reduce error below eq is

f2 > max (f-1, fp).

(S84)

In the main text, this condition is justified with the heuristic argument that proofreading only improves the accuracy if it creates more bias in the dissociation of incorrect complexes compared to the bias in non-dissipative dissociation (unbinding) or product formation. In the following, this condition is justified a posteriori after the minimum error is derived.
In Fig. S1B, we present the flux-based formalism for the MM-with-proofreading scheme, where the noncognate fluxes (i.e. j±1,±2) has already been derived and labeled on the reactions.  stands for the error. The fluxes are constrained by the stationary conditions for ER and EW:

We note that the right hand side is

positive due to conditions f2 > max (f-1, fp) and  < eq 

. f1 fp
f-1

Thus, the left hand side must also be positive,

leading to the minimum error

(S88)

S12

The condition for the minimum error in the presence of proofreading to be smaller than the minimum error without proofreading is

which recovers the condition Eq. S84. This is the condition for the nonequilibrium proofreading mechanism to be relevant. It can be verified that if f2 is smaller than either f-1 or fp, the minimum error can always be achieved without proofreading.
Finally, we consider the energy cost for   (min, eq):

[1, 2].

a. Relation between various error rates. We first verify that the native system operates in the regime where

dissipative proofreading is necessary. The error of the native system is wt = 7.39 × 10-8; the minimum error for

discrimination without proofreading is eq = min (1, p) = 1 = 8.00 × 10-6; the minimum error for the first step is

0

=

f1

=

8.00 × 10-6;

the

overall

is

min

f1

=

3.34 × 10-11.

Therefore,

the

relation

between

these error rates is

0 = eq > wt > min.

(S96)

The native system wt falls within the non-equilibrium discrimination regime. b. Optimal and native proofreading systems The only difference between the DNA replication network and the
MM-with-proofreading scheme is the addition of intermediate states EW* and ER*. The additional states will not
change the error-cost bound since proofreading reaction is driven irreversibly forward in the optimal scheme, as
indicated by the derivation in the last section. Hence, the error-cost bound is the same as that derived in the
MM-with-proofreading scheme:

which is the red line in Fig. 6A of the main text. This bound indeed encapsulates all the systems sampled. At the native error rate, the optimal partition ratio is given by:

a. Relation between various error rates. The error of the native system is wt = 8.65 × 10-4; the minimum error

for discrimination without proofreading is eq = min (1, 2, p) = p = 1.45 × 10-6; the minimum error for the first

two

steps

is

0

min(1, 2)

=

3.45 × 10-4;

the

overall

minimum

error

is

min

=

fp f3

0

=

1.83 × 10-7.

Therefore,

the relation between these error rates is

wt > 0 > eq > min.

(S100)

The native error rate wt falls within the equilibrium discrimination regime, which can in principle be achieved without the proofreading step. As discussed in the main text, achieving eq requires the product formation step kp to be much smaller than the preceding reactions k±1,±2, which could not be realized due to speed requirements. Similarly, achieving 0 without proofreading requires GTP hydrolysis (k2) to be rate-limiting, which is also prevented by speed requirements.
b. Energy-cost bound in the translation network. The network has only one proofreading pathway, and the error-
cost bound takes the same form as the bound in the MM-with-proofreading scheme (Eq. S95) with f1 replaced by 0 (the minimum error in the first two steps) and f2 replaced by f3 (the discrimination factor for the proofreading step). Therefore, the error-cost bound in the ribosome network is

qualitatively similar to the results in WT. The parameters for these two mutants are obtained from ref. [1]. The numeric results are presented in Fig. S2.

C. E. coli isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS)

The reaction network and parameters for the IleRS network are obtained from ref. [3]. The reaction network is

provide detailed derivation for the error-cost bound and the optimal partition ratios.

a. Derivation of the error-cost bound. Here, we show that due to the different discrimination factors in the three proofreading pathways, the optimal partition ratios are no longer uniform, and there will be three proofreading regimes due to the sequential "shutdown" of proofreading pathways.
First, we investigate the case where all three proofreading pathways are utilized, which can be considered as three MM-with-proofreading schemes applied in tandem. The minimum cost in the MM-with-proofreading scheme (Eq. S95) gives the ratio of the total input flux (product formation plus proofreading) to the output (product-forming) flux:

The minimum proofreading cost can thus be calculated by taking the product of the ratios Jin/Jout in all three proofreading pathways, assuming optimal partition ratios. We denote the error at the three proofreading stages as

1,2,3, respective. 3 =  is the final error rate. 0 = min

The denominator can be maximized with Jensen's inequality. Since f (x) = ln(1 - ex) (x  (0, 1)) is a concave function (f (x) < 0), we have

Note that the error rates no longer form a geometric series. Instead, their ratios are modulated by factors b1,2,3. The optimal partition ratios are:

(S114)

where 1,2 take the optimal values indicated in Eq. S113. All three partition ratios decrease as the error  is increased. In the n-stage DBD scheme, the partition ratios are equal, and they go to zero simultaneously at eq = f -1. For the IleRS network, however, the three partition ratios are not equal, and one of them vanishes first. This takes place in
the proofreading pathway with the least b, which is b1 in the IleRS network:

a1

(S115)

For error rates greater than the threshold th1, the above calculation leads to a negative partition ratio (a1 < 0),

which must be regularized to zero.

Hence, the three-stage proofreading analysis only applies to  

, 0

b1b2b3 b2b3

. For larger error, the first proofread-

ing pathway does not function (a1 = 0), and we treat the system as two MM-with-proofreading schemes operating in

tandem. Similarly, an error-cost bound can be obtained:

Cmin

1 + 0 1+

(S116)

The maximum error for this two-pathway regime is determined larger than this value, we have a1 = a2 = 0, and the optimal

by a2 = 0, which leads to  system operates as if there

Therefore, we have derived the piecewise error-cost bound for the IleRS network, which is in agreement with the numeric sampling (Fig. 6C, main text).

(S118)

The native system operates in the one-stage proofreading phase, where the optimal system only utilizes the last (post-transfer) proofreading pathway:

wt = 2.2 × 10-4  (th2, 0).

(S119)

The native partition ratios are

a1

fh1 f3

3.4 × 10-6,

a2

=

fh2 f4

3.6 × 10-3,

a3

=

8.9 × 10-2.

(S120)

The optimal partition ratios are

a1 = a2 = 0,

a3

=

0 - wt wtb3 - 0

=

3.9 × 10-2.

(S121)

S17

Hence, it would seem that the first two proofreading pathways are not utilized, consistent with the theory prediction

(a1 = a2 = 0). The last proofreading pathway is responsible for most of the proofreading, but the third-stage partition ratio in the native system (8.9 × 10-2) is more than twice of its optimal value (3.9 × 10-2). The reason

for the extra proofreading is that 0, which is the minimum error before proofreading, is never realized in the real

system. It is only achieved if the amino acid activation step ka is much slower than binding k±, but such time scale

separation is not realized in the native system. The error rate before proofreading, which in theory could be as low

as

0

9.2 × 10-3,

is

activation

in

system

(calculated

by

taking

the

ratio

of net fluxes in the activation step). If we calculate the partition ratio with 0 replaced by activation, the optimal

partition ratio becomes a3 = 9.3 × 10-2, which is indeed closer to the native system. The reason why 0 could not

be realized is similar to what was discussed in the main text about the ribosome network. 0 could be approached

by either speeding up binding/unbinding reactions or by slowing down the amino acid activation step. Reducing the

activation rate, however, will slow down the speed of product formation. One possible interpretation is that while the

binding and unbinding reactions are already as fast as possible, the native system chooses not to further decrease the

activation rate so as to produce isoleucyl-tRNAIle sufficiently fast, which necessitates additional proofreading in the

post-transfer proofreading pathway.

Hence, the main conclusion here is that the deviation of IleRS from the optimal error-cost bound is due to prioritizing

speed in the activation step. This is consistent with the trade-off analysis in the previous work [3], where ka prefers

to optimize speed rather than error or dissipation. If ka (and the reverse reaction k-a) becomes much slower than

the binding and unbinding rates k±, the accuracy before proofreading will be improved, which will lead to a smaller

partition ratio a3 and lower cost C.
