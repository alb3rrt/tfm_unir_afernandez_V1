Abstract
Proteinoids -- thermal proteins --are produced by heating amino acids to their melting point and initiation of polymerisation to produce polymeric chains. Proteinoids swell in aqueous solution into hollow microspheres. The proteinoid microspheres produce endogenous burst of electrical potential spikes and change patterns of their electrical activity in response to illumination. The microspheres can interconnect by pores and tubes and form networks with a programmable growth. We speculate on how ensembles of the proteinoid microspheres can be developed into unconventional computing devices.
Keywords: thermal proteins, proteinoids, microspheres, unconventional computing

1. Introduction
The resources and methodologies used to manufacture electronic devices raise urgent questions about the negative environmental impacts of the manufacture, use, and disposal of electronic devices [19]. The use of organic materials to build electronic devices may offer an eco-friendly and affordable approach to growing our electronic world [41, 61, 114]. New organic computing substrates might create novel properties impossible to replicate with silicon, expanding the world of computing and electronics in ways unimaginable until now [60, 20, 108, 34]. The sister field of organic electronics is the unconventional computing which uncovers novel principles of efficient information processing in physical, chemical, biological systems, to develop novel computing substrates, algorithms, architectures [3, 10]. Whilst there are many prototypes of organic electronic devices [47, 28, 65, 66] few if any of them show a substantial degrees of stability or biocompatibility [29]. This is

why we propose to explore a unique class of organic devices -- thermal proteins [32] -- as a substrate and an architecture for future non-silicon massive parallel computers. We will discuss on how to hybridise the unconventional computing and organic electronics to design the prototype of a unique microscale proto-neuromorphic network of hollow protein microspheres.

chains (Fig. 1a). The polymerisation happens at 160­200 oC, in absence of a solvent, an initiator or a catalyst, in an inert atmosphere. The tri-functional amino acids, e.g. glutamic or aspartic acid or lysine, undergo cyclisation at high temperature and become solvents and initiators of polymerisation for other amino acids [42, 32]. It is possible to produce proteinoids that are either acidic or basic via this simple thermal condensation reaction. A proteinoid can be swelled in aqueous solution at moderate temperatures (c. 50 Co) forming a structure known as a microsphere [32] (Fig. 1b). The microspheres are hollow, usually filled with aqueous solution.
The growth of micro spheres is programmable. The sizes of the microspheres, 20 µm to 200 µm, can be programmed by selecting subsets of amino acids an thermal regimes [32]. Proteinoid microspheres of dominant hydrophobic constitution form `gap junctions' (Fig. 1c), sprout axon-like outgrowths, and form dendritic networks spontaneously. The microspheres can be embedded into larger microspheres. A communication between microspheres occurs via internal material exchange through the junctions [43]. The proteinoids and dried microspheres remain stable for up 10 years [88, 83].
3. Electrical activity: membrane potential and oscillations
The proteinoid microspheres maintain a steady state membrane potential 20 mV to 70 mV without any stimulating current and some microspheres in the population display the opposite polarization steadily [82]. Electrical membrane potentials, oscillations, and action potentials (Fig. 1d) are observed in the microspheres impaled with microelectrodes. These microspheres exhibit action-potential like spikes. The electrical activity of the microspheres also includes spontaneous bursts of electrical potential (flip-flops), and miniature potential activities at flopped phases [46]. Although effects are of greater magnitude when the microspheres contain glycerol lecithin, purely synthetic microspheres can attain 20 mV membrane potential [83]. In pure 20 µm microspheres an amplitude is 20 mV, in 200 µm microspheres with lecithin 70 mV. The amplitude of spiking is regular in the phospholipid-free microspheres [83]. Membrane, action, and oscillatory potentials recorded from the microspheres composed of thermal protein, glycerol, and lecithin [46, 83] are observed for several days [17]. The microspheres remain stable [88] in aqua at pHs above 7.0oC and continue oscillating for weeks [82].
Exact mechanisms of the proteinoid excitability are not fully agreed on. The physical conditions of the excitability are outlined in [81]. One of the

theoretical models is based on the strength of the coupling between basic and acidic proteinoids where the change abruptly with time due to the material flow [67]. Other models worse considering would be the classical model of ionic gradients established via channels [51] and a generation of the membrane potential by the immobilisation of mobile ions, where the ions absorb on the surface of the proteinoid microspheres, thus generating the nonzero membrane potential [105]. Also we could not rule out a salt water oscillator model [75] which might be valid even in case where pores in the microspheres are passive.

sition of the amino acids it is possible to get either electron-donor or electronacceptor [84]. The spontaneous electrical discharges of the microspheres have been recorded during moderate illumination (Fig. 1e and 2). When the light was off, the gradual slowing of discharges up to complete cessation was observed. While illuminated by intense light, the oscillations stop on the higher level of the potential [46].
5. Pathways to prototyping
Proteinoid microspheres are electrically active. They produce endogenous burst of electrical potential spikes. They can interconnect by pores and tubes and form networks. They respond to stimulation with trains of spikes. Their growth is programmable. The electrical properties, coupled with the connectional properties of the proteinoid microspheres invite us to engage in engineering an artificial brain through the artificial neuron and the self-organising properties that were employed by evolutionary processes. Thus the ensembles of the microspheres can be considered as networks of coupled oscillators or a physical protoneural network (if junctions between microspheres are dynamically modifiable). We propose to investigate how these protoneural networks process information and to evaluate a potential of the networks to be the computing devices.
To prove that computing devices can be implemented using proteinoid microspheres one needs to develop theoretical designs and experimental laboratory prototypes of the sensing and information processing devices from ensembles of the microsphere. This can be done in three steps. First, we will develop an experimental protocol for producing ensembles of proteinoids and recording their electrical activity. Second, we will classify patterns of endogenous electrical activity of the ensembles of proteinoids and catalogue stimuli-to-responses electrical patterns. Third, we will implement mappings of binary strings by ensembles of proteinoids and characterise families of logical circuits implementable by the ensembles.
The proteinoids can be prepared by heating mixtures of amino acids at 190oC under a nitrogen blanket, mechanically stirred with water and filtered [82, 59, 89, 54]. Microspheres assembled from copoly(asp, glu), copoly(asp, glu) complexed with copoly(asp, glu, arg, his). It would be also advantageous to study leucine-rich, threonine-rich, prolinerich, and leucinerich proteinoid: these water-soluble proteinoids formed semipermeable membranes with lecithin [46]. Among these, the leucine-rich proteinoid alone

produce pronounced electrical activities [46]. Intra-microsphere recording can be performed using capillary electrodes
and recordings from ensembles of microspheres will be done via arrays of iridium coated electrodes and using voltage-sensitive dies. Recording of electrical behaviour to be done with Pico ADC-24 loggers fed from micro-electrode array, stimulation with impulse/function generators and cold light sources. The electronic characteristics will be assessed with semiconductor characterisation systems and sourcemeters. Ensembles recorded would consist of up to 40K microspheres in a monolayer or up to 200-300K microspheres in a multilayer, with linear size of the ensembles up to 4 mm. The electrical spiking activity of the proteinoid ensembles might be highly variable compared to neural activity and therefore might not be analysed by standard tools from the neuroscience. We propose to adopt the original techniques for detecting and classifying the spiking activity of fungi [24].
In order to gain insight into the underlying mechanism of the electrical behaviour of the proteinoid spheres, the following experimental data need to be collected: light absorbance, light effect on electrical activity of the spheres, membrane polarisation, current-voltage characteristics, and negative resistance of the polymer, as well as of the membrane, the relationship between copolyamino acid constitution and electrical readout patterns.
The first step towards design of sensing and computing devices from the proteinoid microspheres would be in analysing the endogenous electrical activity of the microspheres ensembles. Such an analysis can be done via studying origins of spontaneous discharges and classification of (ir)regularly oscillating potential dynamics. It might be advantageous to distinguish patterns of spontaneous activity formed by a single spike and different types of bursts according to intra-burst firing frequency and to classify the bursting activity by coefficients of variation of the periods between spikes and serial correlations coefficients of the inter-spike intervals [77, 21, 13, 26, 63]. We could evaluate a likelihood of a synchronisation of bursts recorded from microspheres of the same cluster [120, 102, 12], and an interplay with plasticity and internal bursting [93, 25, 1].
Developing a dynamical model of the growing and re-configurable 3D ensemble of proteinoids. The key component of the model is a process where the external stimuli received by a local domain of the ensemble is accumulated and then transmitted, in the form of propagating excitation wave fronts (recorded as bursts of spikes) or phase shifts in oscillation frequency model parameters, e.g. kinetic constants and the transport coefficients, will be

obtained by the fitting procedure in laboratory experiments. The analysis of the endogenous activity would result in a dictionary of
the patterns of endogenous spiking of proteinoid ensembles. This dictionary would give us a `ground mode' of electrical behaviour and would help to distinguish between electrical events happening in the undisturbed ensembles and those caused by external input stimuli.
A computation with the ensembles of proteinoid microspheres can be implemented in many ways. Based on our previous experience in realising computing schemes in various unconventional substrates, two most feasible approaches would be (1) to adopt algorithms and prototypes of excitable medium computers and to (2) employ techniques of reservoir computing.
Ensembles of proteinoid microspheres can be seen as ensembles of microvolumes of an excitable medium, e.g. analogous to Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) medium [16, 117]. This analogy would allow us to nearly directly adapt all algorithms and prototyping designs of computing with BZ medium to the proteinoid computers. These include the image processes and memory devices [57, 58, 49], logical gates implemented in geometrically constrained BZ medium [95, 92], approximation of shortest path by excitation waves [96, 86, 6], memory in BZ micro-emulsion [49], information coding with frequency of oscillations [36], on-board controllers for robots [8, 115, 111], chemical diodes [45], neuromorphic architectures [38, 39, 99, 35, 103, 99, 40] and associative memory [100, 101], wave-based counters [37], logical gates [95, 92, 2, 7, 106, 5, 4, 98].
The excitable medium algorithms referenced above are strongly dependent on geometrical arrangement of input and output loci of the medium and, often, geometrical constraints on propagation of the excitation wave fronts. When a direct control of proteinoid microspheres' ensembles becomes unfeasible we could adopt a more relaxed approach of reconstructing mapping of binary strings by the ensembles with potential further extraction of the logical gates implemented. This approach was pioneered in our numerical models of the computation on actin bundles and developmnet of an actin droplet machine [11].
A proteinoid machine is an ensemble of proteinoid microspheres interfaced with an arbitrary selected set of k electrodes through which stimuli, binary strings of length k represented by impulses generated on the electrodes, are applied and responses are recorded. The responses are recorded in a form of spikes and then converted to binary strings. The machine's state is a binary string of length k: if there is an impulse recorded on the i th electrode, there
7

is a `1' in the i th position of the string, and `0' otherwise. All possible configurations of binary of length k could be send to pro-
teinoid ensembles. Thus, the ensemble will be implementing mapping E : {0, 1}k  {0, 1}k. We can consider k = 4, 8, 18, 32 I/O setups. The mappings' graphs could be analysed using basic measure (in- and out-degrees distributions), the length of the shortest paths, graph distance matrix, vertex eccentricity, graph radius, graph diameter, node and edge connectivities, closeness centrality, degree centrality, eigenvector centrality. The graphs can be compared using a set of metrics outlines in [113].
From the mappings E we can extract k-inputs-1-output functions. These functions will be analysed and classified by weight, algebraic degree, nonlinearity, query complexity, circuit complexity, influence, sensitivity, block sensitivity and certificate complexity. Results will be in the behavioural characterisation of the finite state machine implementable by ensembles of proteinoid microspheres and families of logical functions implementable by the ensembles.
The approach belongs to same family of computation outsourcing techniques as in materio computing [70, 71, 97, 72, 73] and reservoir computing [112, 64, 22, 56, 23, 107].
6. Example. Computing Boolean functions on an ensemble of proteinoid microspheres.
In this example we will show how to realise Boolean gates with a disordered ensemble of proteinoid microspheres interfaced with an array of electrodes.
A simulated monolayer ensemble of proteinoid microspheres is generated by placing solid discs 7 pixels diameter on the finite lattice. To imitate higher density of the microsphere near the centre of the lattice we placed the discs with probabilities decreasing with increasing distance from the centre (Fig. 3).
We used still image of the ensemble as a conductive template. The image of the ensemble was projected onto a 1000 × 960 nodes grid. The original image M = (mij)1jni,1jnj , mij  {rij, gij, bij}, where ni = 1000 and nj = 960, and 1  r, g, b  255, was converted to a conductive matrix C = (mij)1i,jn derived from the image as follows: mij = 1 if rij < 20, gij < 20 and bij < 20.

We simulated excitation of proteinoid microspheres with FitzHugh-Nagumo equations. The FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) equations [30, 74, 78] is a qualitative approximation of the Hodgkin-Huxley model [15] of electrical activity of living cells:

v t

=

c1u(u - a)(1 - u) - c2uv + I + Du2

(1)

v

= b(u - v),

(2)

t

where u is a value of a trans-membrane potential, v a variable accountable for a total slow ionic current, or a recovery variable responsible for a slow negative feedback, I is a value of an external stimulation current. The current through intra-microsphere spaces is approximated by Du2, where Du is a conductance.
We integrated the system using the Euler method with the five-node Laplace operator, a time step t = 0.015 and a grid point spacing x = 2, while other parameters were Du = 1, a = 0.13, b = 0.013, c1 = 0.26. An excitability of the medium is controlled by parameter c2. In the results presented c2 = 0.095. Boundaries are considered to be impermeable: u/n = 0, where n is a vector normal to the boundary.
To show dynamics of excitation in the ensemble we simulated electrodes by calculating a potential ptx at an electrode location x as px = y:|x-y|<2(ux- vx). Configuration of electrodes 1, · · · , 16 is shown in Fig. 3. The configuration selected imitates a micro-electrode array. Time-lapse snapshots provided in the paper were recorded at every 100th time step, and we display sites with u > 0.04; videos and figures were produced by saving a frame of the simulation every 100th step of the numerical integration and assembling the saved frames into the video with a play rate of 30 fps. Videos are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4884999. Examples of the excitation dynamics are shown in Fig. 4.

We assume that each spike represents logical True and that spikes occurring within less than 2 · 102 iterations are simultaneous. Then a representation of gates by spikes and their combinations can be implemented as shown in Tab. 1. By selecting specific intervals of recordings we can realise several gates in a single site of recording. In this particular case we assumed that spikes are separated if

their occurrences are more than 103 iterations apart. We calculated frequencies of logical gates' implementable at the electrodes
as follows. For each of the recording sites, electrodes, we calculated a number of gates realised during 14.2 · 104 iterations (Tab. 2). The simulated ensemble of proteinoid microspheres can implement two-inputs-two-outputs logical gates when we consider values of two recording electrodes at the same specified interval. For example, a one-bit half-adder: one output is and and another output is xor, and the Toffoli gate: one output is select and another xor.

7. Discussion
When thinking about proteinoid microspheres as proto-neurons [33, 87, 68] one might ask a question `Why proteinoid microspheres not liposomes?'.

14

Andrew Adamatzky Towards proteinoid computers. Hypothesis paper.
Vesicles with lipid membrane are widely studied in the context of artificial life [18, 79, 50, 119, 118], drug delivery [62, 14, 27]. Moreover, as we demonstrated in [44], ensembles of liposomes made of phospholipids combined with viscous amphipathic molecules exhibit spike-like dynamics in electrical potential. However, there are crucial limitations of lipid bilayer membranes as follows. Phospholipid membranes are highly effective barriers to polar and charged molecules, necessitating complex protein channels and pumps to allow the exchange of these molecules with the external environment [69, 76]. Contemporary phospholipid membranes are non-permeable to essential molecules for life, growth, and replication [91, 94]. There is no plausible way of lipid synthesis described under prebiotic conditions [90]. Thus, even though lipid vesicles are prominent models in synthetic protocell research, the conceptual links between RNA replication and compartmentalisation strategies are not well developed [90].
What would be potential breakthroughs and applications of proteinoid computing devices? Fundamental science breakthrough of proteinoid microspheres computing devices will be in the experimental laboratory prototyping of a protoneural network capable for distributed sensing and collective information processing. There are evidences that a first cell might have been similar to a proteinoid microsphere: artificial fossilization of the laboratory products closely resemble ancient microfossils from ancient strata [33]. The findings on propagation of excitation waves in ensembles of proteinoid microspheres will open ways for studying coupling of biochemical and other phenomena in ways that cannot be accomplished with other models such as bilayer membranes. The proteinoids are sufficiently accurate prototypes of terrestrial protocells with bioelectrical properties [31, 109]. Having most characteristics of excitable cells proteinoid microspheres have been considered as protoneurons [82]. A consensus was achieved that proteinoids directly led into neurons, which then self-associated into brains [32]. The association of the microspheres is already evidenced [32].
Applied science domains for future developments in unconventional computing with proteinoids include biodegradable electronics, personalised healthcare, and biocompatible computing. By uncovering mechanisms of distributed sensing and information processing in ensemble of proteinoid microspheres we could establish a new paradigms and experimental protocols for non-silicon biodegradable liquid electronics, and monitoring and micro-intervention devices. These include information processing in natural systems, biophysics and soft matter, non-silicon electronics, synthetic biology, theory of com-

putation. The ensembles of proteinoid microspheres could play a key role in novel developments in healthcare technologies and future therapies, especially delivery and release [85], due to their protein-like nature, biocompatibility, non-toxicity [55]. Proteinoids are already used to encapsulate drugs, e.g. methotrexate [59], hydroxyapatite [104], cholesterol [52], drugs for osteogenic differentiation [48]. Proteinoid microspheres are proposed to be used for treatments of wounds by delivering a sequestered reagent in a controlled manner [85]. Bringing here knowledge of enzymatic logic interfaced with biosensor and drug delivery system [116, 80], we envisage that ensembles of proteinoid microspheres will be used as embedded controllers in implantable drug delivery systems. The networks of proteinoid microspheres will exemplify bio-compatible organic electronic devices.
The proteinoids are neurotrophic [110], they might even delay ageing of neurons [32]. Therefore there is a high potential for the proteinoid computers to be implantable into living brains to act as augmenting, monitoring or prosthetic devices.
