## Abstract

Many modern applications collect data that comes in federated spirit, with data kept locally and undisclosed. Till date, most insight into the causal inference requires data to be stored in a central repository. We present a novel framework for causal inference with federated data sources. We assess and integrate local causal effects from different private data sources without centralizing them. Then, the treatment effects on subjects from observational data using a non-parametric reformulation of the classical potential outcomes framework is estimated. We model the potential outcomes as a random function distributed by Gaussian processes, whose defining parameters can be efficiently learned from multiple data sources, respecting privacy constraints. We demonstrate the promise and efficiency of the proposed approach through a set of simulated and real-world benchmark examples.
