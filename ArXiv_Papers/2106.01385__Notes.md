## Abstract

The possibility that rotating black holes could be natural particle accelerators has been subject of intense debate. While it appears that for extremal Kerr black holes arbitrarily high center of mass energies could be achieved, several works pointed out that both theoretical as well as astrophysical arguments would severely dampen the attainable energies. In this work we study particle collisions near Kerr--Newman black holes, by reviewing and extending previously proposed scenarios. Most importantly, we implement the hoop conjecture for all cases and we discuss the astrophysical relevance of these collisional Penrose processes. The outcome of this investigation is that scenarios involving near-horizon target particles are in principle able to attain, sub-Planckian, but still ultra high, center of mass energies of the order of $10^{21}-10^{23}$ eV. Thus, these target particle collisional Penrose processes could contribute to the observed spectrum of ultra high-energy cosmic rays, even if the hoop conjecture is taken into account, and as such deserve further scrutiny in realistic settings.
