Abstract
In this paper we define two Lie operations, and with that we define the bicharacter algebras, Nichols bicharacter algebras, quantum Nichols bicharacter algebras, etc. We obtain explicit bases for L(V )R and L(V )L over (i) the quantum linear space V with dim V = 2; (ii) a connected braided vector V of diagonal type with dim V = 2 and p1,1 = p2,2 = -1. We give the sufficient and necessary conditions for L(V )R= L(V ), L(V )L= L(V ), B(V ) = F  L(V )R and B(V ) = F  L(V )L, respectively. We show that if B(V ) is a connected Nichols algebra of diagonal type with dim V > 1, then B(V ) is finite-dimensional if and only if L(V )L is finite-dimensional if and only if L(V )R is finite-dimensional.

0 Introduction
Nichols algebras play a central role in the theory of pointed Hopf algebras, and the classification of (braided) Lie algebras has been an international hotspot and cuttingedge problem in the field of algebras. A great deal of attention has been paid to the question of finite-dimensionality of Nichols algebras (see [AHS08, AS10, He05, He06a, He06b, WZZ15b]). The interest in this problem arose from the work of Andruskiewitsch and Schneider [AS98] on classification of finite dimensional (Gelfand-Kirillov) pointed Hopf algebras which are generalizations of quantized enveloping algebras of semi-simple Lie algebras. On the other hand, Lie algebra arising from a Nichols algebra was studied in [AAB17, AAB19]. The theory of Lie superalgebras has been developed systematically, which includes the representation theory and classifications of simple Lie superalgebras and their varieties [Ka77]. A sophisticated multilinear version of the Lie bracket was
1

considered in [Kh99, Pa98, LR95]. Various generalized Lie algebras have already appeared under different names, e.g. Lie color algebras,  Lie algebras [Sc79], quantum and braided Lie algebras [Ma94], braided m-Lie algebras [ZZ04] and generalized Lie algebras [BFM96].
In this work we define two new Lie operations, this is one of the main results in this paper, which enables us to define the bicharacter algebras, Nichols bicharacter algebras, quantum Nichols bicharacter algebra, etc. Braided Lie algebra (with braided Lie operation [u, v] = vu - pv,uuv) seems to be 'located' between two Lie algebras(the usual ones with Lie operation [u, v]- = uv - vu and bicharacter algebras with Lie operation [u, v]L = pv,uuv - pu,vvu or [u, v]R = pu,vuv - pv,uvu), which is of great significance for revealing the relationship between braided Lie algebra and Lie algebra. In the remaining part of this paper will focus on quantum Nichols bicharacter algebras and Nichols bicharacter algebras, which are two cross research targes in Lie algebras and Nichols algebras. It was proven that a Nichols algebra is finite-dimensional if and only if the corresponding Nichols bicharacter algebras is finite-dimensional. This provides a new method for determining when a Nichols algebra is finite dimensional.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 1 we recall some results on Lie algebras and Nichols algebras, and define bicharacter algebras and Nichols bicharacter algebras. In section 2 we give explicit bases for L(V )L and L(V )R over the quantum linear space V with dim V = 2. Section 3 presents explicit bases for L(V )L and L(V )R, where V is a connected braided vector space of diagonal type with dim V = 2 and p1,1 = p2,2 = -1. In section 4 we present the sufficient and necessary conditions for L(V )R= L(V ), L(V )L= L(V ), B(V ) = F  L(V )R and B(V ) = F  L(V )L, respectively. In section 5 we prove that B(V ) is finite-dimensional if and only if L(V )L is finite-dimensional if and only if L(V )R is finite-dimensional, when B(V ) is a connected Nichols algebra of diagonal type with dim V > 1.
Throughout, Z =: {x|x is an integer}. R =: {x|x is a real number}. N0 =: {x|x  Z, x  0}. N =: {x|x  Z, x > 0}. F denotes the base field of characteristic zero. F  = F \{0}. int(a) means the biggest integer not greater than a  R.
1 Preliminaries
In this section we recall some results on Lie algebras and Nichols algebras, and define bicharacter algebras and Nichols bicharacter algebras.
i
Let E = {e1, e2, и и и , en}, ei =: (0, и и и , 0, 1, и и и , 0)  Zn , 1  i  n. Let A := {x1, x2, и и и , xn} be an alphabet and a basis of V = span(A), likewise, associated with each letter xi are an element ei = deg(xi) of Zn and a character xi : Zn - F . Let an empty word by 1, W := {u | u is a word} and a basis of T (V ) = span(W ). Let V 
2

denote the vector space dual to V and {y1, y2, и и и , yn} denote the dual basis of V , where deg(yi) = -ei, yi : Zn - F . Let T (V ) is free generated by 1  V := {1, xi, yi | 1  i 

n} and W is a basis of T (V ) with that each element in W is gotten from one in 1  V by

multiplication elements of 1  V . W is a monoid with 1, for all u  W , denote by deg(u)

an element of the group Zn which results from u by replacing each occurrence of the letter

xi (or yi) with ei (or -ei). By u we denote a character which results from u by replacing

all xi (or yi) with xi (or yi) . For a pair of words u, v  W , put pu,v = u(deg v),

where

pxi,xj

=

xi

(deg

xj

),

p-1 xi,xj

=

xi

(deg

yj

),

p-1 xi,xj

=

yi (deg xj ), pxi,xj

=

yi(deg yj).

Obviously, puu1,v = pu,vpu1,v, pu,vv1 = pu,vpu,v1, that is the operator pи,и is a bicharacter

defined on W . Moreover, we call pи,и is a symmetrical bicharacter if pu,v = pv,u for all

u, v  W . Define u Lv := pv,uuv, u Rv := pu,vuv. It is clear (T (V ), L) and (T (V ),

R) are associative algebras. Assume that A(V ) is in general a quotient algebra of some

subalgebras of T (V ), then (A(V ), L) and (A(V ), R) are associative algebras. Especially,

(T (V ), L) and (T (V ), R) are associative algebras. Let I be the (two sided) ideal in T (V )

generated by all xixj - xjxi, 1  i, j  n and call S(V ) = T (V )/I the symmetric algebra

on V .

Lemma 1.1. If (A, ) is an associative algebra together with the bilinear operation [и, и] defined by [u, v] = u  v - v  u for any homogeneous elements u, v  A, then (A, [и, и]) is a Lie algebra.

If we define the bilinear operations [u, v]L= u Lv - v Lu and [u, v]R = u Rv - v Ru for all u, v  W , then (A(V ), [и, и]L) and (A(V ), [и, и]R) are Lie algebras, which are called Lbicharacter algebra and R-bicharacter algebra, written as A(V )L and A(V )R, respectively. Both L-bicharacter algebra and R-bicharacter algebra are called bicharacter algebras.

Remark 1.2. (i) (S(V ), L)(resp. (S(V ), R)) is a commutative associative algebra if and only if pи,и is a symmetrical bicharacter.
(ii) Let S(V )L and S(V )R denote the Lie algebras generated by V in S(V ) under Lie operations [u, v]L = pv,uuv - pu,vvu, [u, v]R = pu,vuv - pv,uvu, respectively, for any homogeneous elements u, v  S(V ). Then [u, v]L= (pv,u - pu,v)uv = -[u, v]R and S(V )L = S(V )R.
(iii) Linear Lie algebras are Bicharacter algebras, where pv,u = pu,v = 1.

Let hi =: xiyi -yixi, < j, i > are Cartan integers, 1  i, j  n. (ad u)L(v) =: [u, v]L, (ad u)R(v) =: [u, v]R, for any u, v  T (V ).

Proposition 1.3. (See [Hu72, Prop. 18.1, Theor. 18.3]) (1) With the above notation, (AV )L is generated by {xi, yi|1  i  n} and pи,и is a symmetrical bicharacter, then (AV )L is a finite dimensional semisimple Lie algebra if and only if these generators satisfy the following relations:

3

(i) [hi, hj]L= 0, 1  i, j  n.

(ii)

[xi, yi]L=

p-1 xi,xi

hi

,

[xi, yj]L=

0

if

i

=

j.

(iii) [hi, xj]L=< j, i > xj, [hi, yj]L= - < j, i > yj, 1  i, j  n.

(iv) (ad xi)L-<j,i>+1(xj ) = 0 if i = j.

(v) (ad yi)L-<j,i>+1(yj) = 0 if i = j.

(2) With the above notation, (AV )R is generated by {xi, yi|1  i  n} and pи,и is a symmetrical bicharacter, then (AV )R is a finite dimensional semisimple Lie algebra if and

only if these generators satisfy the following relations:

(i) [hi, hj]R= 0, 1  i, j  n.

(ii)

[xi, yi]R=

p-1 xi ,xi

hi

,

[xi, yj]R=

0

if

i

=

j.

(iii) [hi, xj]R=< j, i > xj, [hi, yj]R= - < j, i > yj, 1  i, j  n.

(iv) (ad xi)R-<j,i>+1(xj ) = 0 if i = j.

(v) (ad yi)R-<j,i>+1(yj) = 0 if i = j.

Example 1.4. When dim V = 1, (AV )R is a Lie algebra with generators x1, y1 and

relations

[x1, y1]R=

p-1 x1,x1

h1

,

[h1, x1]R= 2x1,

[h1, y1]R=

-2y1.

Moreover,

(AV )R= (AV )L.

From now on let V = {x1, и и и , xn} is a basis of vector space V and C(xi  xj) =
qijxj  xi with qij = pxi,xj , then V is called a braided vector space of diagonal type,
{x1, и и и , xn} is called canonical basis and (qij)nОn is called braided matrix. In this case,
xi Lxj = (gjиxi)xj, xi Rxj = xi(giиxj). Throughout this paper all of braided vector spaces are connected and of diagonal type without special announcement.
Let Sm  Endk(V m) and S1,j  Endk(V j+1) denote the maps
m-1
Sm = (id m-j-1 S1,j ),
j=1
S1,j = id + C1-21 + C1-21C2-31 + и и и + C1-21C2-31 и и и Cj-,j1+1 (in leg notation) for m  2 and 
j  N. Then the subspace S = kerSm of the tensor algebra T (V ) is a two-sided
m=2
ideal, and algebra B(V ) = T (V )/S is termed the Nichols algebra associated to (V, C)

(See [He05, Def. 1.2.2]). Let Rm := { |  is a primitive m-th root of 1}. Set R3 := {1, , 2}. Let i denote xi
in short, sometimes.

Lemma 1.5. Assume that i = j. (i) [xi, xj]L = 0 if and only if pi,j = pj,i = 1. (ii) [xi, xj]R = 0 if and only if pi,j = pj,i = 1 or pi,j = , pj,i = 2 or pi,j = 2, pj,i = .

Proof. (i) < yi, [xi, xj]L>= (pj,i - 1)xj, < yj, [xi, xj]L>= (1 - pi,j)xi.

(ii) < yi, [xi, xj ]R>= p-i,j1(p2i,j - pj,i)xj , < yj, [xi, xj ]R>= p-j,i1(pi,j - p2j,i)xi.



Let L-(V ), L(V )L and L(V )R denote the Lie algebras generated by V in B(V ) under

Lie operations [u, v]- = uv - vu, [u, v]L = pv,uuv - pu,vvu, [u, v]R = pu,vuv - pv,uvu, respec-

tively, for any homogeneous elements u, v  B(V ). (L-(V ), [и, и]-), (L(V )L, [и, и]L) and

4

(L(V )R, [и, и]R) are called Nichols Lie algebra, Nichols L-bicharacter algebra and Nichols R-bicharacter algebra of V , respectively. Let L(V ) denote the braided Lie algebras generated by V in B(V ) under Lie operations [u, v] = vu - pu,vvu, for any homogeneous elements u, v  B(V ). (L(V ), [и, и]) is called Nichols braided Lie algebra of V .
Remark 1.6. Assume that pи,и is a symmetrical bicharacter. Then L-(V ) = L(V )L = L(V )R since [u, v]R = [u, v]L= pu,v[u, v]- for any homogeneous elements u, v  B(V ).
Let lu0[v]L:= v, lui [v]L:= [u, lui-1[v]L]L, i  1. Similarly define rui [v]L. Let lu0[v]R:= v, lui [v]R:= [u, lui-1[v]R]R, i  1. Similarly define rui [v]R. In fact, lui [v]R:= [u, [u, и и и , [u, v]Rи и и ]R]R.

2 Bicharacter algebra over quantum linear space V with dim V = 2

Throughout this Section quantum linear space V is of diagonal type with basis x1, x2, и и и ,

xn and C(xi  xj) = qijxj  xi, qijqji = 1 for i = j without special announcement. In this case, (L-(V ), [и, и]-), (L(V )L, [и, и]L) and (L(V )R, [и, и]R) are called quantum Nichols

Lie algebra, quantum Nichols L-bicharacter algebra and quantum Nichols R-bicharacter

algebra of V , respectively.

In this Section we will give bases for L(V )L and L(V )R over the quantum linear space

V with dim V = 2.

Let Ni :=

ord(pi,i), when ord(pi,i) > 1 for 1  i  n.

when ord(pi,i) = 1

Proposition 2.1. If P :=

then P is a basis of B(V ).

Proof. It follows from [Kh99, Corollary 1].



Lemma 2.2. Assume that i = j. (i) [xi, xj]L = 0 if and only if pi,j = 1 if and only if pj,i = 1. (ii) [xi, xj]R = 0 if and only if pi,j  R3 if and only if pj,i  R3.

Proof. It is clear by Lemma 1.5.

Lemma 2.4. Let (L0, [и, и]R) be a Lie algebra and u1, u2, и и и , um  L0. If  is a method of
adding bracket [и, и]R on u1, u2, и и и , um, then there exist some j  Sm, j = 1 or -1 such r
that (*) (u1, u2, и и и , um) = j[uj(1), и и и , uj(m)]R.
j=1

Proof. We show (*) by induction on m. Obviously, (*) holds for m = 2. Assume m > 2.

Let (u1, и и и , um) = [1(u1, и и и , us), 2(us+1, us+2, и и и , um)]R. Now we show (*) by induction on s. In case s = 1,

(u1, и и и , um) = [u1, 2(u2, и и и , um)]R r
= j [u1, [uj(2), и и и , uj(m)]R]R (where j  S{2,3.иии ,m} for 1  j  r)
j=1 r
= j[uj(1), uj(2), и и и , uj(m)]R. Therefore, (*) holds. j=1
Assume s > 1 and 1(u1, и и и , us) = [3(u1, и и и , uk), 4(uk+1, uk+2, и и и , us)]R.

See (u1, и и и , um) = [[3(u1, и и и , uk), 4(uk+1, uk+2, и и и , us)]R, 2(us+1, us+2, и и и , um)]R

= [[3(u1, и и и , uk), 2(us+1, us+2, и и и , um)]R, 4(uk+1, uk+2, и и и , us)]R

(by first inductive assumption, where j  S{1,2,3.иии ,k,s+1,s+2,иии,m} for 1  j  r1;

j  S{k+1,k+2.иии ,m} for r1 + 1  j  r2)

r3

=

j[uj(1), и и и , uj(m)]R

j=r2+1

(by second inductive assumption, where j  S{1,2.иии ,m} for r2 + 1  j  r3).

Therefore, (*) holds.



Lemma 2.5. Assume that ui is a homogeneous element and uiuj = pui,uj ujui with pui,uj 

F  and p p ui,uj ui,uj = 1 for 1  i, j  k and pui,uj = 1 when ui = uj. Set li := lui and

(iv) Assume that u1, u2  L(V )R and u1 1u2 2 = 0. If ord(r2,1)  31 or ord(r1,2)  32, then u1 1 u2 2  L(V )R.
(v) Assume that u1, u2  {x1, x2, и и и , xn}. If u1 1u22 = 0, then u1 1u2 2  L(V )R if and

If ord(r1,2)  32, then х2 = r23,1 - 1 = 0, х3 = r13,22 - 1 = 0 by Part (iii) for k = 3. By Part (i) we have u1 1u2 2  L(V )R. Similarly, u1 1u2 2  L(V )R when ord(r2,1)  31.

(v) We only need show the necessity. Assume that it does not holds. By (iii),

Theorem 2.6. If L(V )R is quantum Nichols R-bicharacter algebra over quantum linear space V with dim V = 2, then

L(V )R = span{x1, x2, x2 2x1 1 | 1  i < Ni, i = 1, 2, ord(p1,2)  32 or ord(p1,2)  31} (1)

Proof. Let ui  {x1, x2}, considering Lemma 2.5 (v) we complete the proof.

2.2 Quantum Nichols L-bicharacter algebra
Proposition 2.7. Assumed that L(V )L and L-(V ) are quantum Nichols L-bicharacter algebra and quantum Nichols Lie algebra over the quantum linear space V with dim V = n, 2  n  N. Then L-(V ) = L(V )L.

Proof. [u, v]L=pv,uuv - pu,vvu = pv,upu,vvu - pu,vvu = (1 - pu,v)vu = [v, u] since any

u, v  B(V ) are quantum commutative, i.e. uv = pu,vvu.



Lemma 2.8. Assume that ui is a homogeneous element and uiuj = pui,uj ujui with pui,uj 

F  and p p ui,uj ui,uj = 1 for 1  i, j  k and pui,uj = 1 when ui = uj. Then

Lemma 2.9. Let (L0, [и, и]L) be a Lie algebra and u1, u2, и и и , um  L0. If  is a method of
adding bracket [и, и]L on u1, u2, и и и , um, then there exist some j  Sm, j = 1 or -1 such r
that (*) (u1, u2, и и и , um) = j[uj(1), и и и , uj(m)]L.

Lemma 2.10. Assume that ui is a homogeneous element and uiuj = pui,uj ujui with

pui,uj  F  and p p ui,uj ui,uj = 1 for 1  i, j  k and pui,uj = 1 when ui = uj. Set li := lui

Theorem 2.11. (See [WWZZ18, Theorem 6.7]) If L(V )L is quantum Nichols L-bicharacter algebra over quantum linear space V with dim V = 2, then

L(V )L = span{x1, x2, x2 2 x1 1 | 1  2 < N2, 1  1 < N1, ord(p1,2)  2 or ord(p1,2)  1} (2)

Example 2.12. (i) If p1,2 = 1, then L(V )L = L(V )R= {x1, x2}. (ii) If 3  ord(p1,2), then ord(p1,2)  3x if and only if ord(p1,2)  x for  x  N, thus

Question 2.13. Give bases for L(V )L and L(V )R over the quantum linear space V with dim V = n, 2 < n  N.

3 Nichols bicharacter algebra with dim V = 2 and p1,1 = p2,2 = -1
In this section we obtain explicit bases for L(V )L and L(V )R where V is a connected braided vector space of diagonal type with dim V = 2 and p1,1 = p2,2 = -1.
Lemma 3.1. (See [WZZ, Lemma 4.1]) Assume that B(V ) is a connected Nichols algebra of diagonal type with dim V = 2 and p1,1 = p2,2 = -1.
(i) If u is a non-zero monomial, then there exists   F  such that u = (x1x2)kx1, or x2(x1x2)k, or (x1x2)k+1, or (x2x1)k+1, k  0.
(ii) Let P := {x2(x1x2)k, (x1x2)kx1, (x1x2)k, x2(x1x2)kx1, 0  k < ord(p1,2p2,1)}. Then P is a basis of B(V ).

Proof. (i) It can be proved by induction on i.

(ii) We show this by induction on k. It is clear for k = 1. Now assume k >

1. Then we have (xi1 , xi2 , и и и , xi2k ) = [1(xi1 , xi2, и и и , xi2s ), 2(xi2s+1 , xi2 , и и и , xi2k )]R or (xi1 , xi2 , и и и , xi2k ) = [1(xi1 , xi2 , и и и , xi2s+1 ), 2(xi2s+2 , xi2 , и и и , xi2k )] R. In the first case, we have

(xi1 , xi2 , и и и , xi2k ) = [1(xi1 , xi2 , и и и , xi2s ), 2(xi2s+1 , xi2 , и и и , xi2k )]R = [s(ps1,2(x1x2)s - ps2,1(x2x1)s), t(pt1,2(x1x2)t - pt2,1(x2x1)t)]R
(by inductive assumption, where s + t = k)

= k(pk1,2(x1x2)k - pk2,1(x2x1)k)(where k = 0 ). In second case, we have

(xi1 , xi2 , и и и , xi2k ) = [1(xi1 , xi2 , и и и , xi2s+1 ), 2(xi2s+2 , xi2 , и и и , xi2k )] R

= [s(xj1 xj2 )sxj1 , t(xk1 xk2 )txk1 )] R

= k(pk1,2(x1x2)k - pk2,1(x2x1)k).

when k1 = j1 when k1 = j1

(xi1 , xi2 , и и и , x ) i2k+1 = b[1(xi1 , xi2 , и и и , xi2s ), 2(xi2s+1 , x , i2s+2 и и и , xi2k+1 )]R

(where b = 1 or -1)

= [s(ps1,2(x1x2)s - ps2,1(x2x1)s), t(xk1 xk2)txk1 )]R

= k(xk1 xk2 )kxk1 .

Consequently, (ii) holds.

Theorem 3.3. Assume that L(V )R is a connected Nichols R-bicharacter algebra of diag-

onal type with dim V = 2 and p1,1 = p2,2 = -1. Let P1 :=

with ord(p1,2p2,1) = m <  < ord(p1,2p2,1)}, otherwise.

Then P1 is a basis of L(V )R. Furthermore, if ord(p1,2p2,1) = m < , then

Proof. By Lemma 3.1(ii),Lemma 3.2 (iv), P1 is linearly independent. It follows from

Theorem 3.5. Assume that L(V )L is a connected Nichols L-bicharacter algebra of diag-

onal type with dim V = 2 and p1,1 = p2,2 = -1. Let P2 :=

with ord(p1,2p2,1) = m <  < ord(p1,2p2,1)}, otherwise.

Then P2 is a basis of L(V )L. Furthermore, if ord(p1,2p2,1) = m < , then

dim L(V )L =

3m,

otherwise.

Proof. By Lemma 3.1(ii),Lemma 3.4 (iv), P2 is linearly independent. It follows from

Lemma 3.4 (i) (iii) that P2  L(V )L. By Lemma 3.4 (ii), P2 is a basis of L(V )L.



4 Some Conditions
In this section we give the sufficient and necessary conditions for L(V )R= L(V ), L(V )L= L(V ), B(V ) = F  L(V )R and B(V ) = F  L(V )L, respectively.
Proposition 4.1. If B(V ) is a Nichols algebra of diagonal type, then L(V ) = L(V )R if and only if p2i,i = 1, pi,jpj,i = 1, pi,j  R3 for 1  i = j  n. In this case, L(V ) = L(V )R= V.
Proof. The sufficiency. By [WWZZ18, Coroll.2.5], L(V ) = V . By Lemma 1.5, [xi, xj]R= 0 for i = j and L(V )R= V .
The necessity. We show this by following three steps. (i) p2i,i = 1 since xki  L(V ) for k  ord(pi,i) and xmi / L(V )R when 0 = xmi and m > 1.
12

(ii) If pi,jpj,i = 1 and pi,j / R3 with i = j, then [xi, xj]R= 0 and [xi, xj] = 0. Consequently, [xi, xj]R L(V )R-L(V ), which is a contradiction.
(iii) If pi,jpj,i = 1 with i < j, then 0 = [xi, xj]  L(V ) = L(V )R and [xi, xj] = k[xi, xj]R with k  F . By [WWZZ18, Coroll.2.5], xjxi  L(V ), which implies xjxi = k[xi, xj]R with k  F . This is a contradiction since xjxi and [xi, xj] are linearly independent. 

Proposition 4.2. If B(V ) is a Nichols algebra of diagonal type, then the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) L(V ) = L(V )L. (2) L(V ) = L-(V ). (3) p2i,i = 1, pi,j = pj,i = 1 for 1  i = j  n. In this case, L(V ) = L(V )L= V .

Proof. By [WWZZ18, Prop.6.3], (2)  (3). The proof of (1)  (3) is similar to the

proof of (2)  (3).



Proposition 4.3. Assume that B(V ) is a Nichols algebra of diagonal type. Then B(V ) =

F  L(V )R if and only if pi,i = -1, pi,jpj,i = 1 for all 1  i = j  n and there exist

m-1





Sm

such

that

(p - 1) j=1

=

0

for

all h1

>

h2

>

иии

>

hm

with

hi  {x1, . . . , xn}, 1  i  m.

Proof. The necessity. If there exists 1  i  n such that pi,i = -1, then 0 = x2i  B(V ) and x2i / L(V )R, which is a contradiction. If there exist i, j such that pi,jpj,i = 1 with 1  i < j  n, then [xi, xj] = 0 and [xi, xj]R= 0. Since B(V ) = F  L(V )R, we have that there exist k, k  F  such that [xi, xj] = k[xi, xj]R, and xjxi = k[xi, xj]R, which contradicts to that [xi, xj] and xjxi are linearly independent. Therefore, V is a quantum
linear space.

If there exist h1 > h2 > и и и > hm with hi  {x1, . . . , xn}, 1  i  m, such that

m-1

(p j=1

3 h (j),h (m)иииh (j+1)

for

Sm.

By

[WWZZ18,

Lem.3.2],

Lemma

2.3

and

Lemma 2.4, (h(1), h(2), и и и , h(m)) = 0 for any   Sm and any method  of adding

bracket [и, и]R on h(1), h(2), и и и , h(m). Consequently, 0 = h1h2 и и и hm / L(V )R, which is

a contradiction.

The sufficiency. Obviously, V is a quantum linear space. For  h1 > h2 > и и и > hm

m-1

with

hi

 {x1, . . . , xn}, 1  i  m,

there

exist



 Sm

such

that

(p - j=1

3 h (j),h (m)иииh (j+1)

1) = 0. By Lemma 2.3, we have that there exist a  F  such that h1h2 и и и hm =

Question 4.6. Assume that B(V ) is a Nichols algebra of diagonal type. Give the sufficient and necessary conditions for L(V )L= L(V )R.

5 Classification of L(V )L and L(V )R
In this section it is proved that if B(V ) is a connected Nichols algebra of diagonal type with dim V > 1, then B(V ) is finite-dimensional if and only if L(V )L is finite-dimensional if and only if L(V )R is finite-dimensional.
Let |u| denote the length of word u. A word u  W is called a Lyndon word if |u| = 1 or |u|  2, and for each representation u = u1u2, where u1and u2 are nonempty words, the inequality u < u2u1 holds (see [Kh99, Def. 1]). Any word u  W has a unique decomposition into the product of non-increasing sequence of Lyndon words by [Lo83, Th.5.1.5]. If u is a Lyndon word with |u| > 1, then there uniquely exist two Lyndon words v and w such that u = vw and v is shortest (see [Lo83, Prop. 5.1.3])(the composition is called the Shirshov decomposition of u).
We call u is a standard word with respect to B(V ) if u can not be written as a linear combination of strictly greater words in B(V ).
Let S(B(V )) := {u  W | u is a standard word with respect to B(V )}, written as S in short; L := {u  W | u is a Lyndon word}. Let H := {u  L | [u] is a hard super-letter}. Notice that we view L and H are in B(V ) often for convenience.
Let D =: {[u] | [u] is a hard super-letter}. +(B(V )) := {deg(u) | [u]  D}. (B(V )) := +(B(V ))  -(B(V )), which is called the root system of V. If (B(V )) is finite, then it is called an arithmetic root system.

5.1 (B(V )) is not an arithmetic root system
Lemma 5.1. (See [WZZ, Lem.2.2]) (i) S is a basis of B(V ). (ii) Any factor of a standard word is a standard word. (iii) If u is a standard word, then u = u1u2 и и и ur with u1  u2  и и и  ur and
ui  S  L for 1  i  r.
14

Lemma 5.2. (See [WZZ, Theo.2.4]) If B(V ) is a Nichols algebra of diagonal type, then S(B(V ))  L = H(B(V )).

Lemma 5.3. (i) If l  L, then [l]L= all +

aww in B(V ), where al, aw  F with

w>l,|l|=|w|

al = 0.

(ii) If l  L, then [l]R= bll +

bww in B(V ), where bl, bw  F with bl = 0.

w>l,|l|=|w|

Proof. (i) We show this by induction on | l | . It is clear when | l |= 1 since [l]L= l. Assume that l = uv is the Shirshov decomposition of l. If u > u and v > v with | u |=| u | and | v |=| v |, then uv > uv = l and vu > vu > l.

[l]L = pv,u[u][v] - pu,v[v][u]

= pvu(auu +

au u)(avv +

av v)

u >u,|u |=|u|

v >v,|v |=|v|

-pu,v(avv +

av v)(auu +

auu) (by inductive hypothesis)

v >v,|v |=|v|

u>u,|u|=|u|

= all +

aww.

w>l,|l|=|w|

(ii) The proof is similar to the proof of (i).



Theorem 5.4. If B(V ) is a Nichols algebra of diagonal type and (B(V )) is not an arithmetic root system, then dim L(V )L= ,dim L(V )R= .

5.2 (B(V )) is an arithmetic root system

For our study of Nichols algebras we will need some non-standard formulas for quantum

integers and Gaussian binomial coefficients.

In the ring Z[a], let (0)a = 0 and for any m  N, (m)a = 1 + a + a2 + и и и + am-1.

The polynomials (m)a with m  Z are also known as quantum integers. Moreover, let m
(0)!a = 1, and for any m  Z let (m)!a = (k)a. For any k, m  Z with 0  k  m, the

(2) It can be proved by induction.

(iii) We show (1) by induction on k for 1  k  m. See

< yi, lim[j]R >=< yi, pmi,i-1pi,jxilim-1[j]R-pmi,i-1pj,ilim-1[j]Rxi > = pmi,i-1{(pi,j -pj,ip-i,j1p1i,-i m)lim-1[j]R+pi,jp-i,i1xi < yi, lim-1[j]R> -pj,i < yi, lim-1[j]R> xi}.
Thus equation (1) holds when k = 1. Assume k > 1. See

< yik, lim[j]R>
=< yi, pmi,i-1{(pi,j - pj,ip-i,j1pik,-i 1-m)(k - 1)p-i,i1 < yik-2, lim-1[j]R> +pi,jpi-,ik+1xi < yik-1, lim-1[j]R> -pj,i < yik-1, lim-1[j]R> xi} > (by inductive hypothesis)
= pmi,i-1{(pi,j - pj,ip-i,j1pik,-i 1-m)(k - 1)p-i,i1 < yik-1, lim-1[j]R> +pi,jpi-,ik+1 < yik-1, lim-1[j]R> +pi,jp-i,ikxi < yik, lim-1[j]R> -pj,i < yik, lim-1[j]R> xi - pj,ip-i,j1pik,-i m < yik-1, lim-1[j]R>}

16

= the right hand side of (1). Consequently, (1) holds.

Now we show (2) by induction on m. (2) is clear when m = 1. By (1), one obtains

< yim, lim[j]R>= pmi,i-1(pi,j - pj,ip-i,j1)(m)p-i,i1 < yim-1, lim-1[j]R> = (pi,j - pj,ip-i,j1)(m)pi,i < yim-1, lim-1[j]R> = (pi,j - pj,ip-i,j1)(m)pi,i(pi,j - pj,ip-i,j1)m-1(m - 1)!pi,ixj (by inductive hypothesis)
=the right hand side of (2). Therefore, (2) and (3) hold.

(iv) If pi,i = 1, then < yimyj, lim[j]L>= (pi,jp-j,i1 - pj,i)m(m)! and < yjyim, lim[j]L>=

(pi,j - pj,ip-i,j1)m(m)! by (ii) and (iii).

(v) It follows from (ii) and (iii).



Lemma 5.7. Assume that B(V ) is a Nichols algebra of diagonal type and m  N, i = j.
Then (i) If pi,j = pj,i = 1, then lim[j]L = 0. m(m-1)
(ii) (1) < yj, lim[j]L>= pi,i 2 (1 - pi,j)mxmi . (2) < yimyj, lim[j]L>= (1 - pi,j)m(m)!pi,i. (iii) (1)< yik, lim[j]L>= pmi,i-1{(pj,i - pik,-i m)(k)p-i,i1 < yik-1, lim-1[j]L>

(v) Assume that pi,i = 1. Then lim[j]L= 0, when ord(pi,i) > m with pi,j = 1 or pj,i = 1.

(2) It can be proved by induction.

(iii) We show (1) by induction on k for 1  k  m. See
< yi, lim[j]L >=< yi, pmi,i-1pj,ixilim-1[j]L-pmi,i-1pi,j lim-1[j]Lxi > = pmi,i-1{(pj,i - p1i,-i m)lim-1[j]L+pj,ip-i,i1xi < yi, lim-1[j]L> -pi,j < yi, lim-1[j]L> xi}.
Thus equation (1) holds when k = 1. Assume k > 1. See
< yik, lim[j]L> =< yi, pmi,i-1{(pj,i - pik,-i 1-m)(k - 1)p-i,i1 < yik-2, lim-1[j]L> +pj,ipi-,ik+1xi
< yik-1, lim-1[j]L> -pi,j < yik-1, lim-1[j]L> xi} > (by inductive hypothesis) = pmi,i-1{(pji - pik,-i 1-m)(k - 1)p-i,i1 < yik-1, lim-1[j]L> +pj,ipi-,ik+1 < yik-1, lim-1[j]L> +pj,ip-i,ikxi < yik, lim-1[j]L> -pi,j < yik, lim-1[j]L> xi - pi,jp-i,j1pik,-i m < yik-1, lim-1[j]L>}
= the right hand side of (1). Consequently, (1) holds.

Now we show (2) by induction on m. (2) is clear when m = 1. By (1), one obtains < yim, lim[j]L>= pmi,i-1(pj,i - 1)(m)p-i,i1 < yim-1, lim-1[j]L> = (pj,i - 1)(m)pi,i < yim-1, lim-1[j]L> = (pj,i - 1)(m)pi,i(pj,i - 1)m-1(m - 1)!pi,ixj(by inductive hypothesis)

17

=the right hand side of (2). Therefore, (2) and (3) hold.

(iv) If pi,i = 1, then < yimyj, lim[j]L>= (1 - pi,j)m(m)! and < yjyim, lim[j]L>= (pj,i - 1)m(m)! by (ii) and (iii).

(v) It follows from (ii) and (iii).



Proposition 5.8. Assume that B(V ) is a Nichols algebra of diagonal type. Then (i) dim(L(V )R) =  when there exist i and j with i = j, pi,j = p2j,i or pj,i = p2i,j and
ord(pi,i) = 1 or . (ii) dim(L(V )L) =  when there exist i and j with i = j, pi,j = 1 or pj,i = 1 and
ord(pi,i) = 1 or .
Lemma 5.9. (See [WZZ, Lemma 5.1]) The set of monomials xsi xjxti with 0  s  mij, 0  t  ord(pi,i) - 1 for i < j and the set of monomials xsi xjxti with 0  t  mij, 0  s  ord(pi,i) - 1 for i > j are linearly independent.

We know mij  ord(pii) - 1.

Proposition 5.10. For m  N, i = j. (i) Assume that pi,j = p-j,i1 = 1, then lim[j]L = 0 if and only if ord(pi,i) > m  0, lim[j]R
= 0 if and only if pj,i / R3 and ord(pi,i) > m  0. (ii) Assume that mij = ord(pi,i) - 1, pi,jpj,i = 1, then lim[j]L= 0 if and only if 0  m 
mij - 1 + ord(pi,i) if and only if lim[j]R= 0.

Proof. (i) We can show lim[j]L= pi,i 2 (1-pi,j)mjim and lim[j]R= pi,i 2 p2i,mj (1-p3j,i)mjim

Lemma 5.11. Assume that B(V ) is a connected Nichols algebra of diagonal type with dim V > 1. Then

(i) If pi,i = pj,j = -1 and ord(pi,jpj,i) =  for i = j. then dim(L(V )R) = , dim(L(V )L) = .
(ii) If (B(V )) is an arithmetic root system and there exists u  D such that ord(pu,u) = , then there exists 1  i  n such that ord(pi,i) =  or dim(L(V )R) = , dim(L(V )L) = .

Proof. (i) It follows from Theorem 3.3 and Theorem 3.5.

(ii) If there exists u  D such that ord(pu,u) = , then there exists a 1  i  n such

that ord(pi,i) =  but Case of [He05, Row 3 Diagram 2, Table 1], [He05, Row 8, Diagram

5.3 Finiteness of L(V )L and L(V )R

Proposition 5.12. Assume that B(V ) is a connected Nichols algebra of diagonal type. Then dim(B(V )) =  and dim(L(V )L) <  if and only if dim V = 1 and ord(p1,1) = 1 or .

Proof. Sufficiency is clear.

Necessity. Assume dim V > 1. By Theorem 5.4, (B(V )) is an arithmetic root system.

Consequently, there exists u  D such that ord(pu,u) = . Considering Lemma 5.11 (ii)

and Proposition 5.8 (ii) we get a contradiction.



Proposition 5.13. Assume that B(V ) is a connected Nichols algebra of diagonal type. Then dim(B(V )) =  and dim(L(V )R) <  if and only if dim V = 1, ord(p1,1) = 1 or .

Proof. Sufficiency. It is clear. Assume dim V > 1. By Theorem 5.4, (B(V )) is an

arithmetic root system. Consequently, there exists u  D such that ord(pu,u) = .

Considering Lemma 5.11 (ii) and Proposition 5.8 (i) we have pi,j = p2j,i, pj,i = p2i,j, then

pi,jpj,i = 1, pi,j  R3, which is a contradiction.



Using Proposition 5.12 and Proposition 5.13 one obtains the following result.

Theorem 5.14. Assume that B(V ) is a connected Nichols algebra of diagonal type with dim V > 1, then the following conditions are equivalent: (i) B(V ) is finite-dimensional; (ii) L(V )L is finite-dimensional; (iii) L(V )R is finite-dimensional.
