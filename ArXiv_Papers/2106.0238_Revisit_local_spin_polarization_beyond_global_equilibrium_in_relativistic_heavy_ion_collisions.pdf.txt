Abstract
We have studied local spin polarization in the relativistic hydrodynamic model. Generalizing the Wigner functions previously obtained from chiral kinetic theory in Ref. [1] to the massive case, we present the possible contributions up to the order of from thermal vorticity, shear viscous tensor, other terms associated with the temperature and chemical-potential gradients, and electromagnetic fields to the local spin polarization. We then implement the (3+1) dimensional viscous hydrodynamic model to study the spin polarizations from these sources with a small chemical potential and ignorance of electromagnetic fields. Although the shear correction alone upon local polarization results in the sign and azimuthal-angle dependence more consistent with experimental observations, as also discovered in other recent studies, it is mostly suppressed by the contributions from thermal vorticity and other terms that yield an opposite trend. It is found that the total local spin polarization could be very sensitive to the equation of states, the ratio of shear viscosity over entropy density, and freezeout temperature.

I. INTRODUCTION
In non-central heavy-ion collisions, large orbital angular momenta (OAM) can be generated and transferred to the quark gluon plasma (QGP) in the form of vorticity fields. Proposed by Liang and Wang [2, 3] in early pioneer works, the global OAM could trigger the spin polarization of interacting partons through spin-orbit coupling. The magnitude of vorticity can be accordingly extracted through the spin polarization of hadrons created from the experiments. Later on, relativistic fermions with spin in thermal equilibrium have been systematically studied in the statistical model and a more precise relation to the possible experimental observation has been established [4­6]. On the other hand, the properties and dynamical evolution of vorticity are further analyzed via numerical simulations in AMPT and HIJING [7­9]. Assuming the global equilibrium condition and employing the modified Cooper-Frye formula for spin polarization [6, 10], the spin polarization of  hyperons in heavy ion collisions has been estimated based on UrQMD [11] and hydrodynamic models [12­16]. See also Refs. [17­20] for other related studies. The theoretic predictions and follow-up studies [9, 11, 21­24] remarkably agree with the later measurement of the global polarization for  and ¯ hyperons by STAR collaboration [25]. It is also shown an average angular velocity or vorticity of QGP is as large as   1022s-1 [25], which reveals that the QGP could be the most vortical fluid so far.
Despite the agreement between theory and experiment in global polarization, STAR collaboration has also measured the azimuthal angle dependence of the spin polarization along the beam and the out-plane directions in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV [26, 27], known as the longitudinal and transverse local spin polarization, respectively. Most of theoretical simulations, e.g. relativistic hydrodynamics [28, 29] and transport models [11, 22, 30] failed to describe the measurements of local polarization with a few exception such as the numerical simulation from the kinetic theory of massless fermions in Ref. [31] and results from some phenomenological models in Ref. [16, 32, 33]. In general, these theoretical estimations have found the local polarization with an opposite sign against the experimental result. Also, the feed-down effects are found to be negligible for recoiling the tension [34, 35]. This disagreement between theory and the experiment for local spin polarization is dubbed as the "sign" problem.
Since most of the previous simulations rely on the assumption that spin polarization for
2

 hyperons at the freezeout hypersurface is mainly induced by the thermal vorticity in light of the statistical model [6] and Wigner-function approach [36] in global equilibrium, it is generally believed that the non-equilibrium effects beyond the assumption for global equilibrium is essential to delineate the local spin polarization. Consequently, many theoretical efforts have been inputted to study dynamical spin polarization. One microscopic theory for tracking the dynamical evolution of spin transport for relativistic fermion is the quantum kinetic theory (QKT). The QKT was developed for the massless fermions [1, 37­52] at the very beginning, known as the chiral kinetic theory (CKT). To describe the spin dynamics in particular for strange (s) quarks or  hyperons, QKT has been extended to the case for massive fermions [53­65]. In Ref. [66], another microscopic model for spin polarization through particle collisions is proposed. As for the macroscopic descriptions, one may need to add the spin effects to the relativistic hydrodynamics, i.e. relativistic spin hydrodynamics [67­77]. It has been derived from many approaches, e.g. the entropy principle [72, 78, 79], the Lagrangian effective theory [75, 76], kinetic approaches [67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74], and general discussion from field theory [80]. Also, see recent reviews [81­85] and the references therein.
Nevertheless, to simulate the spin polarization of relativistic fermions far from equilibrium is technically difficult and computationally expensive. It is instead natural to explore the spin polarization near local equilibrium. From the detailed balance of massless fermions with 2-to-2 scattering in CKT, it has been shown that the Wigner function pertinent to spin polarization contains several corrections besides the thermal vorticity in local equilibrium as derived by some of the authors of this paper [1] in 2017. Recently, the authors in Refs. [86, 87] have found similar contributions for massive fermions in local equilibrium, which have smooth connection to part of the massless result. Based on their findings with peculiarly the shear correction, the hydrodynamic simulations in Ref. [88] show qualitative agreement with experimental data by computing the polarization of s quarks in  hyperons. Simultaneously, the authors in Ref. [89] have added the contribution from shear viscous tensor to the local spin polarization near isothermal equilibrium, in which the numerical results also agree with the experimental data qualitatively.
A natural question then arises: whether the numerical finding above with the shear corrections is sensitive to the parameters chosen in the hydrodynamics simulations? If the answer is positive, it implies that the correct "sign" for local polarization may not be solely
3

attributed to the shear correction in local equilibrium and further non-equilibrium corrections depending on interaction should be considered. Therefore, we follow the early work [1] done by some of the authors in the present paper and list all possible local-equilibrium corrections to the local spin polarization up to the order of . We then implement (3 + 1)dimensional viscous hydrodynamics to investigate the polarization induced by these effects. In order to examine the dependence of the numerical parameters in simulations, we use a different equation of states (EoS) as opposed to the one adopted in Ref. [88] and discuss the dependence of freezeout temperature and the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we review the main results in our early work [1] and present all possible corrections in local equilibrium to polarization up to the order of explicitly. After that, we implement the viscous hydrodynamical simulations with AMPT initial condition to study the polarization and discuss the dependence of freezeout temperature and the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density in Sec. III. We summarize in Sec. IV.
Through out this paper, we use the Minkowski metric gµ = diag{+, -, -, -} and define the Levi-Civita tensor µ with the convention 0123 = - 0123 = 1. We also introduce the notations A(B)  (AB + AB)/2 and A[B]  (AB - AB)/2.

II. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS FROM QUANTUM KINETIC THEORIES

We are interested in the polarization (pseudo) vector characterized by the axial-charge

current density in phase space,

Here

J+µ(p, X)

and

J-µ(p, X) denote the Wigner functions for right and left-handed fermions, respectively. Given

J5µ(p, X), we can calculate the spin polarization of  hyperons via the modified Cooper-Frye

formula [6],

Sµ(p) = ´ d´ · pJ5µ(p, X) ,

(2)

2m d · N (p, X)

1 For the computation of spin polarization, we usually apply the on-shell Wigner functions. Here we thus integrate over the energy defined as p · n, where nµ may be chosen as the fluid four velocity in thermal equilibrium. Also, we further introduce a unit-step function to omit the contribution from anti-fermions.

where N µ(p, X)  2 ´p·n[J+µ(p, X) + J-µ(p, X)] is the number density in phase space and m is the mass of  and µ is the normal vector of the freezeout surface.
As derived in the early work [1], the Wigner functions for right or left-handed fermions near local equilibrium are given by 2

In general, f should incorporate non-equilibrium corrections depending on interaction to satisfy the kinetic equation near local equilibrium, while the corrections are expected to be higher orders in the gradient expansion and omitted here for simplicity [1, 90].

2 In general, there exist off-equilibrium corrections pertinent to collisions, which are however higher-order in gradient expansion starting from O() and O(2) for parity even and odd terms, respectively. These corrections are neglected here.

and we have set the same chemical potential for both left and right fermions µ = µ+ = µ-

for simplicity. The subscripts, thermal, shear, accT, chemical and EB, stand for the terms

related to thermal vorticity, shear viscous tensor, the fluid acceleration minus gradient of

temperature Duµ - (µT )/T , the gradient of µ/T , and electromagnetic fields, respectively. Except for Jtµhermal and part of JEµB led by magnetic fields, all other terms in J5µ come from the corrections beyond global equilibrium.
Let us take a close look at the JaµccT, which is usually neglected due to the following reason. One may utilize hydrodynamic equations of motion up to the order of or 2,

to replace the temporal derivatives D upon thermodynamic parameters, where and P correspond to the energy density and pressure, respectively. Here the corrections in Eq. (20) are irrelevant since they only contribute to higher-order terms at O( 2) in Wigner functions except for the off-equilibrium fluctuations led by collisions. In the conformal limit, with the EoS = 3P and one of the hydrodynamic equations of motion becomes Duµ = (µT )/T . Therefore, the JaµccT vanishes in the conformal limit of ideal hydrodynamics. In the realistic hydrodynamic simulations, one needs to utilize the EoS from the lattice QCD instead of = 3P and the viscous tensor µ also modifies the evolution of Duµ. In the viscous hydrodynamics, we have,

Du =

O(

(21)

where µ corresponds to the shear-stress tensor. Therefore, we would like to emphasize here that the contributions from JaµccT to the local spin polarization should depend on the EoS and parameter /s with , s being the viscosity and entropy density. Note that in the early work [91], the authors have discussed the contribution from fluid acceleration Du implicitly

involved in Jtµhermal to local polarization. Additionally, the magnetic-field contribution in JEµB has been also discussed in Ref. [10].

Although we discuss the polarization of massless fermions above, we may extend our

analysis to massive fermions. In the case of massive fermions, we may generalize the on-

shell condition (p2) in Eq. (18) to (p2 - m2i ) with mi being the mass of fermions. Then,

we obtain the Sµ in Eq. (2) from different sources,

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Setup for Simulations

In this section, we implement the (3+1) dimensional viscous hydrodynamic CLVisc [92,

93] with AMPT initial conditions [16, 33, 94] to generate the freezeout hyper-surface and

the profile of fluid velocity and temperature at that hyper-surface. Unless noted otherwise,

we choose the EoS "s95p-pce" [95] instead of the EoS [96] used in Refs. [29, 88].

We introduce the polarization along the beam direction as Pz(p) and along the out-

plane direction as Py(p), which are obtained by integrating over the medium rapidity range

gradient. Therefore, in the current study, we will only consider the polarization induced by

The possible contribution from Scµhemical will also be briefly discussed later. We consider two scenarios in this work. In the first scenario, since the  hyperons are
produced at the chemical freezeout, we assume that one can still utilize the macroscopic variables from hydrodynamics to describe the thermodynamical states of  hyperons, e.g. the temperature and its gradient, i.e. we assume that  hyperons are almost at local equilibrium. We name it as  equilibrium scenario for short.

over the total spin of  hyperon in the parton model, one can compute the polarization of s quarks and assume the spin polarization of the s quark is smoothly passed to the polarization of . We name it as the s equilibrium scenario. Since the s quarks are much lighter than  hyperons, polarization induced by shear viscous tensor will be greatly enhanced in the s equilibrium scenario as opposed to the  equilibrium scenario, where Ssµhear is suppressed by (u · p)  m in the denominator shown in Eq. (22).
Note the polarization vectors in Eq. (23) are shown in the laboratory frame. In order to compare the results with the experimental data, we eventually transform them to the rest frame of the  hyperon for the  equilibrium scenario or of the s quark in the  hyperon for the s equilibrium scenario. In principle, we also need to consider the evolution of  hyperons before kinetic freezeout, whereas we neglect the evolution of  hyperons after the chemical freezeout for simplicity.
We would like to emphasize that we always choose the factor m in the denominator of

[88] is instead chosen as ms in the s equilibrium scenario, which will make an enhancement to the overall magnitude of polarization in the s equilibrium scenario. For numerical simulations, we choose m = 1.116 GeV for the mass of  hyperons and ms = 0.3 GeV for the mass of constituent s quarks.

B. Numerical Results and Discussions
Here we briefly summarize the results presented in each figure. In Fig. 1, we show the local spin polarization coming from different sources in the lab frame. In Fig. 2, we compare the results in the particles' rest frames to those in Fig. 1. In Fig. 3, we present the results with reduced freezeout temperature. In Fig. 4, the results with larger /s but the same freezeout temperature as Fig. 1 are presented. Finally, we show the spin polarization led

by a small and constant chemical potential from Pcµhemical for a heuristic discussion. The detailed results and discussions are presented below.
In Fig. 1, we plot the local spin polarization in both  and s equilibrium scenarios with /s = 1/(4) and the freezeout temperature T = 165 MeV. We observe that the Ssµhear always leads to the "same" sign contribution, qualitatively consistent with experimental data, to the
local spin polarization in both z and y directions and in the two scenarios. This observation is in accordance with Ref. [88]. Similar to thermal vorticity, SaµccT induced by non-vanishing Duµ - (µT )/T leads to the "opposite" sign contribution to the local polarization. Along the beam direction, the magnitude of polarization PazccT is much smaller than the magnitudes of Ptzhermal and Pszhear in the two scenarios. Along the out-plan direction, the PayccT is almost canceled with Psyhear in  equilibrium scenario, while |PayccT| < |Psyhear| in the s equilibrium scenario. As a consequence of the competition between Psµhear and Ptµhermal + PaµccT, the Ptzo,tyal in both  and s equilibrium scenarios disagree with the experimental data.
In contrast, the hydrodynamic simulations in Ref. [88] find that the Ptµotal in s equilibrium scenarios agree with the experimental data qualitatively. As mentioned previously, we
have chosen a different EoS against the one in Ref. [88]. Our results imply that the spin
polarization with local-equilibrium corrections from hydrodynamic simulations are sensitive
to the choice of EoS.
In Fig. 2, we compare the polarization in the laboratory frame and in particles' rest

13

frames. It is found the difference of the polarization in the two frames is mild for Ptzotal. Although the overall magnitudes and peaks of Ptyotal are reduced in the particles' rest frames, in general, the choices of frames do not change the polarization qualitatively.
Next, we consider the dependence of freezeout temperature. We set the freezeout temper-
ature T = 157 MeV and keep /s = 1/(4), and show the results in Fig. 3. The magnitudes of PaµccT increase significantly when freezeout temperature decreases 3. The physical reason might be explained as follows. In extremely high temperature, the fluid is close to the conformal limit, which yields Duµ - (µT )/T  0. Accordingly, SaµccT and PaµccT will approximately vanish. More precisely, in light of the EoS from lattice simulations, we may
assume = (3 + )p with   0 as a parameter characterizing non-conformality at the freezeout temperature. Approximating p  4pT -1T , one finds Duµ  4(4 + )-1T -1T by using hydrodynamic equations of motion in Eq. (20) and thus |JaµccT|  /(4 + ), which can be enhanced by non-conformality. As a result, when the freezeout temperature decreases and approaches the critical temperature, the magnitude of PaµccT increases and polarization induced by Duµ - (µT )/T plays an important role to the total local polarization. On the other hand, we observe that the shear induced polarization Psµhear is not sensitive to the freezeout temperature, while the magnitude of thermal vorticity induced polarization Ptµhermal is slightly enhanced. The difference between Ptµotal in the two scenarios and experimental data increases due to the growth of the magnitude of PaµccT. It turns out that the Ptµotal is also sensitive to the freezeout temperature.
Thirdly, we discuss the dependence of /s. In Fig. 4, we set the /s = 2/(4) and
freezeout temperature T = 165 MeV. In comparison with the case of /s = 1/(4) in Fig. 1, we find that all contributions to Pz in the two scenarios have not changed much. On the contrary, the magnitudes of both Ptyhermal and PayccT in the two scenarios increase when /s grows. The magnitudes of Psyhear in the two scenarios become smaller than those in Fig. 1. Eventually, the Ptyotal in the two scenarios are still different with the observation in experiments. It is found that the local polarization at least for Ptyotal also depends on /s.
At last, we compute the possible contribution from the gradient of chemical potential
3 In fact, the magnitude of Ptµhermal also depends on the freezeout temperature since Jtµhermal implicitly incorporate the term related to Duµ. But this term has been previously included in the hydrodynamic simulations for Ptµhermal in global equilibrium. It is worthwhile to note the full Wigner functions in local equilibrium, derived in Ref. [1], actually does not contain a term associated with Duµ.

over temperature led by Scµhemical in Eq. (22). For simplicity, we assume that the chemical potential is constant near the freezeout hypersurface and µ/T µ(1/T ). In Fig. 5, we choose the quark chemical potential µ = 10 MeV. Similar to the shear viscous tensor, the Scµhemical leads to the "same" sign contribution, qualitatively consistent with experimental data, to the local spin polarization in both z and y directions and in the two scenarios. However, Pcµhemical  µ is highly suppressed by other contributions in Ptµotal. So far, they are almost negligible in the current study. However, Pcµhemical might be important in the low-energy collisions. We will leave it for the future studies.
As a concluding remark, we have shown that Ptµotal is generally sensitive to EoS, freezeout temperature T , and the ratio /s. We find that both Ssµhear and SaµccT play important roles to local spin polarization. The behavior of Ptµotal strongly depends on the predominant term in the competition between Psµhear and Ptµhermal + PaµccT. Although Ssµhear may lead to the "same" sign to the polarization, we still cannot get similar azimuthal angle dependence of local spin polarization as the experimental data with the EoS we have chosen.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this work, we first review the spin polarization (pesudo) vector Sµ(p) derived from Wigner functions in Ref. [1]. We decompose Sµ(p) into Stµhermal, Ssµhear, SaµccT, Scµhemical and SEµB, which are led by thermal vorticity, shear viscous tensor, fluid acceleration minus the gradient of temperature, the gradient of chemical potential over temperature, and electromagnetic fields, respectively. We then implement of (3+1) dimensional viscous hydrodynamic CLVisc with AMPT initial conditions to obtain the numerical results for local spin polarization with zero electromagnetic fields and a vanishing chemical potential and focus on Ptµhermal, Psµhear, and PaµccT contributed by Stµhermal, Ssµhear, and SaµccT. Inspired by Ref. [88], we also consider  and s equilibrium scenarios. As opposed to Ref. [88], we have chosen the EoS "s95p-pce" as a different EoS and investigate the influence of /s upon spin polarization.
Our numerical results show that both Psµhear and PaµccT affect Ptµotal in addition to Ptµhermal that has been well studied in the literature. Although Psµhear can lead to the "same" sign contribution, qualitatively consistent with experimental data, to the local spin polarization, PaµccT also plays a crucial role and could change the behavior of Ptµotal especially with lower freezeout temperature. It turns out that Ptµotal is rather sensitive to EoS, /s and freezeout
15

temperature T . With the adopted EoS in our study, we do not observe the similar azimuthal angle dependence of local spin polarization as the experimental data.
We conclude that although the shear induced polarization alone may result in sizable effects on local spin polarization qualitatively consistent with experimental observations, it may not be always the dominant effect over other contributions in local equilibrium. Consequently, the so-called "sign" problem remains an open question. Moreover, from the theoretical perspective, the Wigner function in local equilibrium without the inclusion of offequilibrium corrections pertinent to interaction is not a self-consistent solution for a kinetic equation. As indirectly supported by the influence from /s, even in the near-equilibrium condition, the second-order gradient terms, such as the non-equilibrium corrections qualitatively studied in e.g. Refs. [1, 90] from CKT, may potentially give rise to sizable contributions in numerical simulations. To comprehensively investigate the spin polarization of fermions near local equilibrium and its direct connection to the "sign" problem , it will be still imperative to conduct the theoretical and numerical studies of spin hydrodynamics and the QKT with collisions.
