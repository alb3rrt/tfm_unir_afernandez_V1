Abstract. In this paper, we prove a global existence and blow-up of the positive solutions to the initial-boundary value problem of the nonlinear porous medium equation and the nonlinear pseudo-parabolic equation on the stratified Lie groups. Our proof is based on the concavity argument and the Poincar´e inequality, established in [38] for stratified groups.

where m  1 and p  2, f is locally Lipschitz continuous on R, f (0) = 0, and such
that f (u) > 0 for u > 0. Furthermore, we suppose that u0 is a non-negative and non-trivial function in C1(D) with u0(x) = 0 on the boundary D for p = 2 and in L(D)  S°1,p(D) for p > 2, respectively.

Definition 1.1. Let G be a stratified group. We say that an open set D  G is an admissible domain if it is bounded and if its boundary D is piecewise smooth and simple, that is, it has no self-intersections.

Let G be a stratified group. Let D  G be an open set, then we define the functional spaces

S1,p(D) = {u : D  R; u, |Hu|  Lp(D)}. We consider the following functional

(1.3)

Jp(u) :=

1 p
|Hu(x)|pdx .
D

Thus, the functional class S°1,p(D) can be defined as the completion of C01(D) in the norm generated by Jp, see e.g. [7].
A Lie group G = (Rn, ) is called a stratified (Lie) group if it satisfies the following
conditions: (a) For some integer numbers N1 + N2 + ... + Nr = n, the decomposition Rn =
RN1 × . . . × RNr is valid, and for any  > 0 the dilation

(x) := (x, 2x(2), . . . , rx(r))

is an automorphism of G. Here x  x(1)  RN1 and x(k)  RNk for k = 2, . . . , r.

(b) Let N1 be as in (a) and let X1, . . . , XN1 be the left-invariant vector fields on G

such

that

Xk(0)

=

 xk

|0

for

k

=

1, . . . , N1.

Then

the

H¨ormander

rank

condition

must

be satisfied, that is,

rank(Lie{X1, . . . , XN1}) = n,

for every x  Rn. Then, we say that the triple G = (Rn, , ) is a stratified (Lie) group. Recall that the standard Lebesgue measure dx on Rn is the Haar measure for G
(see e.g. [14], [39]). The left-invariant vector field Xj has an explicit form:

for the horizontal gradient, and

Lpf := H · (|Hf |p-2H f ), 1 < p < ,

(1.5)

for the p-sub-Laplacian. When p = 2, that is, the second order differential operator

N1
L = Xk2,

(1.6)

k=1

is called the sub-Laplacian on G. The sub-Laplacian L is a left-invariant homogeneous

hypoelliptic differential operator and it is known that L is elliptic if and only if the

step of G is equal to 1.

One of the important examples of the nonlinear parabolic equations is the porous

medium equation, which describes widely processes involving fluid flow, heat transfer

or diffusion, and its other applications in different fields such as mathematical biology,

lubrication, boundary layer theory, and etc. Existence and nonexistence of solutions to problem (1.1) for the reaction term um in the case m = 1 and m > 1 have

been actively investigated by many authors, for example, [3, 4, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16,

20, 21, 22, 28, 30, 41, 42, 43], Grillo, Muratori and Punzo considered fractional

porous medium equation [17, 18], and it was also considered in the setting of Cartan-

Hadamard manifolds [19]. By using the concavity method, Schaefer [44] established

a condition on the initial data of a Dirichlet type initial-boundary value problem for

the porous medium equation with a power function reaction term when blow-up of

the solution in finite time occurs and a global existence of the solution holds. We

refer for more details to Vazquez's book [45] which provides a systematic presentation

of the mathematical theory of the porous medium equation.

The energy for the isotropic material can be modeled by a pseudo-parabolic equa-

tion [10]. Some wave processes [6], filtration of the two-phase flow in porous me-

dia with the dynamic capillary pressure [5] are also modeled by pseudo-parabolic

equations. The global existence and finite-time blow-up for the solutions to pseudo-

parabolic equations in bounded and unbounded domains have been studied by many

researchers, for example, see [26, 27, 33, 34, 37, 47, 48, 49] and the references therein.

In [46], Veron and Pohozaev have obtained blow-up results for the following semi-

linear diffusion equation on the Heisenberg groups

u(x, t

t)

-

Lu(x,

t)

=

|u(x,

t)|p,

(x, t)  H × (0, +).

Also, blow-up of the solutions to the semi-linear diffusion and pseudo-parabolic equations on the Heisenberg groups was derived in [1, 2, 13, 24, 25]. In addition, in [40] the authors found the Fujita exponent on general unimodular Lie groups.
In some of our considerations a crucial role is played by

· The Poincar´e inequality established by the first author and Suragan in [38] for stratified groups:

Lemma 1.2. Let D  G be an admissible domain with N1 being the dimension of the first stratum. Let 1 < p <  with p = N1. For every function u  C0(D\{x = 0}) we have

|H u|pdx

(1.8)

the

constant

|N1-p|p (pR)p

the domain D. Then  in (1.7) is dependent on the size of the domain D.

Our paper is organised so that we discuss the existence and nonexistence of positive

solutions to the nonlinear porous medium equation in Section 2 and the nonlinear

pseudo-parabolic equation in Section 3.

2. Nonlinear porous medium equation
In this section, we prove the global solutions and blow-up phenomena of the initialboundary value problem (1.1).

2.1. Blow-up solutions of the nonlinear porous medium equation. We start with the blow-up properly.

Theorem 2.1. Let G be a stratified group with N1 being the dimension of the first stratum. Let D  G be an admissible domain. Let 2  p <  with p = N1.
Assume that function f satisfies

F (u)  umf (u) + upm + , u > 0,

(2.1)

where for some

F (u) = pm

|N1 - p|p ( - m - 1) (pR)p m + 1

and  > m + 1,

where R = supxD |x| and x = (x, x) with x being in the first stratum. Let u0  L(D)  S°1,p(D) satisfy the inequality

such that

Remark 2.2. Note that condition on nonlinearity (2.1) includes the following cases:

1. Philippin and Proytcheva [35] used the condition

(2 + )F (u)  uf (u), u > 0,

(2.5)

where  > 0. It is a special case of an abstract condition by Levine and Payne [31]. 2. Bandle and Brunner [4] relaxed this condition as follows

(2 + )F (u)  uf (u) + , u > 0,

(2.6)

where  > 0 and  > 0.
These cases were established on the bounded domains of the Euclidean space, and it is a new result on the stratified groups.

Proof of Theorem 2.1. Assume that u(x, t) is a positive solution of (1.1). We use the concavity method for showing the blow-up phenomena. We introduce the functional

J

(t)

:=

-

m

|Hum(x, t)|pdx +

(F (u(x, t)) - )dx,
