. PROJECTIVE PRIMES AND THE BATEMAN­HORN CONJECTURE
GARETH A. JONES AND ALEXANDER K. ZVONKIN
Abstract. As a consequence of the classification of finite simple groups, the classification of permutation groups of prime degree is complete, apart from the question of when the natural degree (qn - 1)/(q - 1) of PSLn(q) is prime. We present heuristic arguments and computational evidence based on the Bateman­Horn Conjecture to support a conjecture that for each prime n  3 there are infinitely many primes of this form, even if one restricts to prime values of q.
1. Permutation groups of prime degree
One of the oldest problems in Group Theory is to classify the permutation groups of prime degree, originally studied in terms of the solution of polynomial equations of prime degree. Let G be a transitive permutation group of prime degree p. In 1831 Galois [16] proved that G is solvable if and only if G is (isomorphic to) a subgroup of the 1-dimensional affine group
AGL1(p) = {t  at + b | a, b  Fp, a 0} Cp  Cp-1
containing the translation subgroup {t  t+b} Cp. There is one such group G for each d dividing p - 1, namely
{t  at + b | a, b  Fp, ad = 1} Cp  Cd. In 1906 Burnside ([8], [9, §251]) proved that if G is nonsolvable then G is 2-transitive. In this case G has a unique minimal normal subgroup S which is simple and also 2-transitive, with centraliser CG(S ) = 1, so that G  Aut S . This reduces the problem to studying nonabelian simple groups S of degree p and their automorphism groups. The classification of finite simple groups (announced around 1980) implies a classification of those with 2-transitive actions (see [10], for example). Most of these have composite degree; those of prime degree are as follows:
a) S = Ap, G = Sp, for primes p  5; b) S = PSLn(q)  G  PLn(q) = PGLn(q)  Gal Fq in cases where the natural degree
m := (qn - 1)/(q - 1) of these groups is prime; c) S = PSL2(11), M11 and M23 for p = 11, 11 and 23. In (b) the groups act on the m points (or m points and hyperplanes if n  3) of the projective geometry Pn-1(Fq) for a prime power q. In (c), PSL2(11) acts on the 11 cosets of a subgroup H A5 (two conjugacy classes, giving two actions, equivalent to those on the vertices and cells of the hendecachoron or 11-cell, a nonorientable 4-polytope discovered independently by Gru¨nbaum [18] and Coxeter [11]); M11 and M23 are Mathieu groups, acting on block designs with 11 and 23 points.

Unfortunately, this result does not tell us when the degree m in (b) is prime. Indeed, it is unknown whether there are finitely or infinitely many such `projective primes', as we will call them.
Open Problem: In (b), is the degree m = qn - 1 = 1 + q + q2 + · · · + qn-1 (q a prime power) q-1
prime in finitely or infinitely many cases?
If n = 2 the projective primes m are the Fermat primes 1 + 2e, e = 2 f ; the only known examples are 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537 for f  4. If q = 2 the primes m are the Mersenne primes 2n - 1, n prime; at the time of writing, 51 examples 3, 7, 31, . . . , 282 589 933 - 1 are known. It is widely conjectured that there are no further Fermat primes, but infinitely many Mersenne primes. These are very old and difficult problems; with nothing new to say about them, we will assume from now on that n, q  3.
Our main conjecture is that there are infinitely many projective primes. The goal of this note is to present heuristic arguments and computational evidence to support this conjecture. See [23] for further details, [22] for applications to dessins d'enfants (maps on surfaces representing curves defined over algebraic number fields), and [24] for a similar problem involving block designs.

2. Waring's Problem

Projective primes have occasionally been examined by number theorists, but in a completely different context, that of Waring's Problem (see [20, Ch. XX], for example). This asks whether, for each integer m  1, there is an integer g(m) such that each positive integer is a sum of at most g(m) m-th powers. For instance g(1) = 1, and g(2) = 4 by Lagrange's Four Squares Theorem. After Hilbert [21] proved the existence of g(m) in 1909, Tornheim [35] and Bateman and Stemmler [4] considered similar problems in other number systems. In each case, they took m to be prime for simplicity, and encountered extra difficulties when m was what we have called a projective prime. The reason is that if m = (qn - 1)/(q - 1) then every m-th power in the field Fqn lies in the subfield Fq, so elements outside Fq cannot be sums of m-th powers. An investigation in [4] of the frequency of this occurrence led Bateman and Horn [3] to the conjecture we will discuss in the next section.

3. Conjectures
If a polynomial f (t)  Z[t] takes infinitely many prime values for t  N then clearly
· its leading coefficient is positive, · it is irreducible in Z[t], and · it is not identically zero modulo any prime.
In 1857 Bunyakovsky, the discoverer of the infinite-dimensional form of the Cauchy­Schwarz inequality, conjectured in [6] that these conditions are also sufficient. (The last condition is needed to exclude cases like t2 + t + 2, which is irreducible but takes only even values.) The case deg f = 1 is true: this is Dirichlet's Theorem on primes in an arithmetic progression (see [5, §5.3]). No other case is proved, not even t2 + 1, studied by Euler [13] and Landau. Writing q = pe we require the result for f (t) = 1 + te + t2e + · · · + t(n-1)e, but with the extra condition that t should also be prime.

Schinzel's Hypothesis H [34] deals with this restriction by extending Bunyakovsky's conjecture

to finite sets of polynomials f1, . . . , fk simultaneously taking prime values infinitely often. An

obvious necessary condition is that each fi should satisfy the first two Bunyakovsky conditions,

while the third is that f (t) :=

k i=1

fi(t)

should

not

be

identically

zero

modulo

any

prime.

For

example, t(t + 1) is identically zero mod (2), while t(t + 2) is not. It is conjectured that these

conditions are also sufficient, but as in the case of the Bunyakovsky Conjecture this has been

proved only in the case k = 1, deg f1 = 1. In addition to cases with k = 1, such as the Euler­

Landau problem, conjectures which would follow from a proof of Hypothesis H include

· f1 = t, f2 = t + 2, the twin primes conjecture;
· f1 = t, f2 = 2t + 1, the Sophie Germain primes conjecture; · f1 = t, f2 = 1 + te + t2e + · · · + t(n-1)e for fixed e and n, particular cases of our projective
primes conjecture, provided f2 is irreducible (see Section 4).

In 1962 Bateman and Horn [3] proposed a quantified version of Schinzel's Hypothesis H which, if proved, would imply all the above conjectures (see [1] for an excellent survey). The Bateman­ Horn Conjecture (BHC) asserts that if distinct polynomials f1, . . . , fk satisfy the above conditions, and Q(x) is the number of positive integers t  x such that f1(t), . . . , fk(t) are all prime, then

k  1, so E(x)   with x; thus f1(t), . . . , fk(t) are simultaneously prime for infinitely many t

provided the conjecture is true. However, it is proved only in the case of Dirichlet's Theorem.

Since

For a heuristic proof of the BHC, if each fi has degree di and leading coefficient ci, then fi(t)  citdi as t  . By the Prime Number Theorem a randomly-chosen integer close to citdi is prime

This suggests a first estimate of

for the probability that f1(t), . . . , fk(t) are all prime, and hence a corresponding estimate of

1

,

k i=1

di

2 (ln t)k

for the number of positive integers t  x satisfying this condition. However, the hypotheses imply

that the values f1(t), . . . , fk(t) are not quite random. For each prime r we should multiply the probability (5) by a correction factor ar/br, where

ar

=

-

 f (r) r

and

1k

br =

1- r

are the probabilities that none of the integers f1(t), . . . , fk(t) is divisible by r, and that none of a randomly-chosen k-tuple of integers is divisible by r. This gives E(x) in (1), with r ar/br providing the correction factor C.
Li [27] has recently proposed a modification of the BHC, in which the simplification (4), no
doubt essential in the early days of computing, is avoided, and 1/ ln fi(t) is used instead of 1/di ln t. This gives significantly better estimates E(x) in cases such as the Sophie Germain primes conjecture involving a non-monic polynomial fi, but when each fi is monic, as in our case, the effect is negligible.

4. Irreducibility of f2 In order to apply the BHC, we need to ensure that our polynomial f2 is irreducible.

Lemma 4.1. Given integers n  2 and e  1, the polynomial

f2(t)

=

tne - 1 te - 1

=

1 + te

+

t2e

+

···+

t(n-1)e

is irreducible in Z[t] if and only if n is prime and e is a power ni (i  0) of n.

Proof. If k  N the cyclotomic polynomial k(x) is, by definition, the polynomial with integer
coefficients whose roots are the primitive kth roots of unity. It is irreducible and has degree (k), where  is the Euler totient function. For any n  N we have xn - 1 = d|n d(x) (see [5, §5.2.1] or [29, §4.3, Problem 26]). Putting x = te gives

tne - 1

(6)

f2(t) = te - 1 = d(t),

d

with the product over all d which divide ne but not e. Thus f2 is irreducible if and only if there is just one such divisor d (which is ne itself, of course). By considering the prime power decompositions of e and ne one can see that this happens if and only if n is prime and e is a power of n.
5. Primality testing
To find Q(x) for various large x, we used the Rabin­Miller (RM) primality test [32]. It determines whether a given number is prime or composite without trying to factor it but by checking independent instances of a necessary primality condition. There is a real abyss between the complexities of the most efficient factoring algorithms and the RM-test. To give but one example, it took 4400 GHz-years to factor a 232-digit number into two 116-digit primes, see [33]. The RM-test gives a correct answer ("the number is composite") in less than 0.0005 seconds on a very modest laptop.
The RM-test is probabilistic. If it affirms that a given number is composite, then it is indeed composite. If, however, the test affirms that a number is prime, the number may turn out to be composite. The probability of such an event is infinitesimally small: during 40 years of widespread use of the RM-test not a single such error has ever been reported1. Note also that long computations are prone to hardware errors. If, however, by incredibly bad luck a few of our `primes' are composite, this would not invalidate our evidence of literally millions of projective primes.
6. Applying the Bateman­Horn Conjecture
6.1. Relative abundance of types of projective primes. We tested the BHC estimates for projective primes against the results of computer searches. Define a projective prime m = 1+q+· · ·+qn-1 with q = pe, p prime, to have type (e, n). For each type satisfying Lemma 4.1 define P(x) = P(e,n)(x) to be the number of primes p  x such that p and m are prime, and let E(x) = E(e,n)(x) be the corresponding Bateman­Horn estimate (1) for P(e,n)(x), formed using the polynomials
f1(t) = t and f2(t) = 1 + te + t2e + · · · + t(n-1)e.
The smallest projective primes m are those of type (1, 3), of the form m = 1+ p+ p2 with p prime (recall that we have excluded the case n = 2), so this type appears most frequently in searches up to a given bound. For example, all but 301 of the 1 974 311 projective primes m  1018 have type (1, 3). The second most frequent type is (1, 5), with 252 examples m  1018.
As further evidence for the abundance of projective primes of type (1, 3), our colleague Jean Be´tre´ma examined all primes p  1011 using the package Primes.jl of the language Julia. This is much more efficient than Maple for problems of this sort. We partially reproduce Be´tre´ma's results in Table 1.
Thus 129 294 308 primes p  1011 give a prime m of type (1, 3); the largest is 99 999 999 977, with m = 9 999 999 995 500 000 000 507. The ratio decreases as the upper limit grows, but it seems reasonable to conjecture that even in this restricted case there are infinitely many projective primes.
1A dialogue from Gilbert and Sullivan's I am the Captain of the Pinafore comes to mind: "What, never? No, never. What, never? Well, hardly ever".

Table 1. The second column gives the number of primes in the corresponding seg-
ment, while the third column gives the number of those primes p which yield a projective prime m = 1 + p + p2. The proportion of such primes among all the primes of the second column is given in the fourth column.

In making our estimates, we concentrated on the apparently most abundant case of type (1, 3), though we did not neglect other apparently less frequent types, such as (1, 5) and (3, 3). For types (1, n) with n prime the polynomials f1 = t and f2 = 1 + t + t2 + · · · + tn-1 satisfy the conditions of the BHC. The roots of f = f1 f2 in Fr are 0 for all primes r, together with 1 if r = n, and the n - 1 primitive n-th roots of 1 if r  1 mod (n), so  f (r) = 2, n or 1 as r = n, r  1 mod (n) or otherwise.
6.2. Type (1, 3). Using these values for n = 3, we computed C = C( f1, f2) = 1.5217300621 . . . by taking partial products in (2) over the primes r  109. To count primes m = 1 + p + p2  1018 we took p  x = 109 (solving 1+ x+ x2 = 1018 would be more precise, but the difference is negligible). Using numerical integration, Maple gives
x dt  2 594 294,
2 (ln t)2
leading to an estimate C x dt
E(x) = E(1,3)(x) = 2 2 (ln t)2  1 973 868.
Comparing this with the true value P(x) = P(1,3)(x) = 1 974 010, found by computer search, shows that the error in E(x) is about 0.0072%.
As a second experiment with type (1, 3) we took x = i · 1010 for i = 1, 2, . . . , 10. Table 2 gives the resulting values of P(x), E(x) and E(x)/P(x). In each case the error is at most 0.0035%.

6.3. Type (1, 5). For projective primes of type (1, 5), using f1 = t and f2 = 1 + t + · · · + t4 we found that C = 2.5710484414 . . .. To count such primes m  1018 we took x = 109/2. Maple gives

so that

C x dt E(1,5)(x) = 4 2 (ln t)2 = 246.71835772250112020,

6.4. Type (3, 3). With f1 = t and f2 = 1 + t3 + t6, we found that C = 2.086089094. Taking x = 103, Maple gives
C x dt E3,3(x) = 6 2 (ln t)2 = 12.0593535318,
compared with the true value P(3,3)(x) = 10.

6.5. Other types (e, n). For other fixed types (e, n) there are too few projective primes within our range of feasible computation for comparisons to be meaningful. Nevertheless, in all cases E(e,n)(x)   as x  , so the accuracy of the above estimates encourages us to conjecture that there are infinitely many projective primes of each possible type (e, n).

6.6. Fixed q, n  . Computer searches for fixed q and n   are even more difficult, and the BHC no longer applies (though similar heuristic estimates are possible), so rather than making a conjecture we simply ask whether any fixed q (necessarily prime, by Lemma 4.1) yields infinitely many projective primes. This generalises the Mersenne primes problem for q = 2.

7. Groups of prime power degree
Although this paper concentrates on those cases where the natural degree m of PSLn(q) is prime, there is also interest in cases such as PSL2(8) and PSL5(3) where m is a prime power (32 and 112 respectively). For instance, Guralnick [19] has shown that if a nonabelian simple group S has a transitive representation of prime power degree, then S is an alternating group or PSLn(q) acting naturally, or PSL2(11), M11 or M23 acting as in (c) in Section 1, or the unitary group U4(2) Sp4(3) O5(3) permuting the 27 lines on a cubic surface. In particular, S is doubly transitive in all cases except the last, where it has rank 3. See also [12], where Estes, Guralnick, Schacher and Straus have shown that for each prime p there are only finitely many e, q, n  3 such that pe = (qn - 1)/(q - 1).
If n is composite then PSLn(q) cannot have prime degree, but could it have prime power degree? More generally, while a reducible polynomial f (t)  Z[t] can take only finitely many prime values, can it take infinitely many prime power values? This issue is addressed in [24].

8. Application of the BHC to block designs
A construction by Amarra, Devillers and Praeger [2] of block-transitive point-imprimitive 2designs with specific parameters depends on certain polynomials, such as f (t) = 32t2 + 20t + 1, taking prime power values. Using all primes r < 108 gives C( f )  4.721240276, and Li's modified BHC then gives an estimate E(108) = 12 362 961.06. In fact, there are 12 357 532 values of t  108 such that f (t) is prime. The relative error is 0.044%. See [24] for further details.

9. A critique of heuristic reasoning

Basing heuristic estimates on the independence of congruences modulo different primes is controversial [26, 36]. This is best illustrated with Po´lya's discussion in [31] of a well-known paradox.
Let us attempt a heuristic proof of the Prime Number Theorem. An integer x is prime if and only if x 0 mod (r) for each prime r  x. For each such r this event has probability (r - 1)/r, so by regarding these events as mutually independent, and using a theorem of Mertens (see [28], [20, §22.9] or [29, Theorem 8.8(e)]), one might expect x to be prime with probability

where µ = exp(-) = 0.561459 . . . and  is the Euler­Mascheroni constant 0.577215 . . .. However,

the correct asymptotic formula is 1/ ln x, so (7) underestimates it. Of course, it is sufficient to eliminate prime factors r  x1/2, rather than r  x, so this alternative approach gives a second

estimate

This overestimates the probability. If, as suggested by Po´lya in [31], one takes the product over all primes r  xµ then the correct formula is obtained. Po´lya confesses that it is not clear why this
"trick of the magic µ" works here, but he argues that mathematicians should imitate physicists by

adapting their theories to fit experimental data when such paradoxes arise. Similar phenomena are discussed by Po´lya [31] in relation to prime pairs and their generalisations, and by Wagstaff [36] in relation to divisors of Mersenne numbers.
Nevertheless, we defend the use of the BHC with the evidence that in a number of different contexts it produces estimates which are remarkably close to observed data.

10. Related open problems
We close with two conjectures which, while much less important than those considered above, nevertheless have their own interest.
10.1. The Goormaghtigh Conjecture (1917). Since 1 + 2 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 31 = 1 + 5 + 52,
both PSL5(2) and PSL3(5) have natural degree 31. Goormaghtigh, a Belgian engineer and amateur mathematician, conjectured in [17] that this example and
1 + 2 + 22 + · · · + 212 = 8191 = 1 + 90 + 902 are the only positive integer solutions of (xn - 1)/(x - 1) = (yk - 1)/(y - 1) with n k and n, k  3. This conjecture is still open. Although 8191 is prime, 90 is not a prime power, so only the first example is relevant to permutation groups PSLn(q).
10.2. The Feit­Thompson Conjecture (1962). Feit and Thompson [14] conjectured that if p and q are distinct primes then (pq - 1)/(p - 1) does not divide (qp - 1)/(q - 1). They stated that if true this would significantly shorten their 255-page proof [15] that groups of odd order are solvable. However, an alternative simplification was found by Peterfalvi [30] in 1984. The conjecture has been proved by Le [25] for q = 3, but it is otherwise still open.

2Numerous publications, as well as the English Wikipedia (visited on June 30, 2020), give the following wrong title for Bunyakovsky's paper: "Nouveaux the´ore`mes relatifs a` la distinction des nombres premiers et a` la de´composition des entiers en facteurs". According to the French Wikipedia (see [7]), an article with this title does indeed exist, but it was published in 1840 and not in 1857, and it does not discuss the conjecture in question. The reader may also consult the original paper reproduced in the Google archive.
