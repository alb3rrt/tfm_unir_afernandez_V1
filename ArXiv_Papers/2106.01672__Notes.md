## Abstract

In this work we study and establish some quenched functional central limit theorems (CLT) for stationary random fields under a projective criteria. These results are functional generalizations of the theorems obtained by Zhang et al. (2020) who themselves extended the quenched functional CLT for ortho-martingales established by Peligrad and Voln{Ã½} (2020) to random fields satisfying a Hannan type projective condition. In the work of Zhang et al. (2020), the authors have already proven a quenched functional CLT however the assumptions were not optimal (as they require the existence of a 2 + $\delta$-moment). In this article, we establish the results under weaker assumptions, namely we only require a Orlicz space condition to hold.
