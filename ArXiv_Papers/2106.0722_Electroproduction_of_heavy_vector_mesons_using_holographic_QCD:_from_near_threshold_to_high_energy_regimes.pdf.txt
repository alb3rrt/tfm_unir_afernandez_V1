We develop a non-perturbative analysis of the electro-production of heavy vector mesons (, J/) from threshold to high energy. We use the holographic construction with bulk confinement enforced through a soft wall. Using Witten diagrams, we evaluate the pertinent cross sections for heavy vector mesons (, J/) production and study their dependence on both the incoming virtual photon polarization as well as the outgoing polarization of the heavy meson. Our results for J/ electro-production compares well with the available HERA data at low and intermediate Q2, and for a wide range of momentum transfer. We also predict the quasi-real electro-production of J/ near threshold.

I. INTRODUCTION
Diffractive production of heavy mesons such as charmonia and bottomonia through the scattering of real or virtual photons on a proton, is amenable to the scattering of a virtual hadron on a proton when the photon coherence length becomes comparable to the nucleon size. By varying the virtuality Q2 of the photon and its polarization, a scanning of the reaction as a function of the virtual hadron size and light cone content can be carried out.
At small Q2 the photon virtual size is comparable to the hadronic size, and the diffractive process is similar to that observed in diffractive hadron-hadron scattering with a strong dependence on the soft or non-perturbative Pomeron process. With increasing Q2, the virtual size of the photon decreases. The decrease is sensitive to the virtual polarization and allows for a characterization of the transition from the non-perturbative to perturbative physics.
We will address the diffractive problem at low and intermediate Q2 non-perturbatively in the context of holographic QCD, which embodies among others the preQCD dual resonance model. The approach originates from a conjecture that observables in strongly coupled gauge theories in the limit of a large number of colors, can be determined from classical fields interacting through gravity in an anti-de-Sitter space in higher dimensions [1]. The present study will be a follow up on our recent photo-production analysis of heavy mesons [2]. We note that exclusive production of heavy mesons in the holographic context has been considered in [3­6], and in the non-holographic context in [7].

mesons have been pioneered at HERA. Data from ZEUS and H1 show that with increasing Q2 the production is enhanced, a point in favor of a transition from a soft Pomeron to a hard Pomeron mechanism. The holographic construction captures this transition through a migration of the low lying string fluctuations in bulk from the infrared to the ultraviolet section of the AdS space [8, 9]. For completeness, we note that the holographic formulation of the Pomeron as a string exchange in bulk, was initiated originally in [10].
More recently, the GlueX collaboration at Jefferson LAB has turned measurements of threshold charmonium production at the photon point [11], which are in the process of further refined by the ongoing measurements from the high precision J/-007 collaboration [12]. A chief motivation for these experiments is a measure of the gluonic contribution entering the composition of the nucleon mass, and possibly the threshold photo-production of the LHCb pentaquark. The importance of the gluon exchange in the diffractive production of J/ near threshold has been suggested in [13], and received considerable attention lately [2, 14].
The organization of the paper is as follows: In section II we outline the general set up by detailing the pertinent kinematics, and briefly reviewing the graviton and dilaton bulk actions and couplings essentials for the construction of the diffractive electro-production amplitude of charmonium using a Witten diagram. In section III, the differential and total cross sections for J/ electro-production are detailed near threshold and far from threshold for both the transverse and longitudinal polarizations. Remarkably, in the double limit of large Nc and strong coupling the tensor or A-form factor dominates solely the threshold production, and its Reggeized form its high energy counterpart. In section IV, the results from near threshold are compared to the GlueX data at the photon point, with the ensuing predictions for the quasi-electro-production given. In section V, we compare our results for J/ electro-production to the

2

existing HERA data. We also extend our analysis to the lighter -meson production. Our conclusions are in section VI. A number of Appendices are added to provide the necessary definitions and details for many of the sections.
II. GENERAL SET UP
In our recent analysis of the holographic photoproduction of heavy mesons [2], we noted that even close to threshold the process was mostly diffractive and domi-

nated by the exchange of a massive tensor 2++ graviton at threshold, and higher spin-j exchanges away from threshold that rapidly reggeize. The scalar 0++ glueballs were found to decouple owing to their vanishing coupling to the virtual photons, while the dilatons were shown to decouple from the bulk Dirac fermion. At threshold, the holographic photoproduction amplitude solely probes the gravitational A-form-factor which maps on the gluonic contribution to the energy momentum tensor of the nucleon as a Dirac fermion in the bulk. We now extend these observations to the electro-production process.

A. Differential cross section and kinematics
The differential cross section for electro-production of heavy mesons V = J/,  involves the exchange of a bulk j = 2 graviton near threshold, and higher spin away from threshold. We will postpone the higher spin exchanges and their Reggeization to later. Specifically, consider the DIS process (q, ) + N (p)  V (q , ) + N (p ) with in and out polarizations. The corresponding differential cross section is

with a virtual and space-like q2 = -Q2 < 0, and Mandelstam s = (q + p1)2 > 0 with t = (q - q )2 < 0. We will analyze (II.1) using holography with mostly negative signature µ = (+, -, -, -) in 4-dimensions, and
in the center-of-mass (CM) frame of the pair composed the virtual photon  and the proton. Specifically, for the
incoming channel q = (q0, 0, 0, qz) and p1 = (p10, 0, 0, p1z = -qz) and for the outgoing channel q = (q0, qV ) and p2 = (p20, -qV ). We also have

(II.4)

q0 = E = -Q2 + qz2, q0 = EV = MV2 + |qV |2, p10 = m2N + qz2, and p20 = m2N + |qV |2. Since , V are treated as gauge particles, we can use the gauge freedom to choose both polarizations to be 4-
transverse to the incoming momenta or · q = 0 and · q = 0. For the incoming , we can set the polarizations
as

1 T =± =  (0, 1, -i, 0)

which satisfy

We can set the phase angle  = 0 since the differential cross-section is independent of it.

FIG. 1: Witten diagram for the diffractive photoproduction of vector mesons with a bulk wave function V . The thick lines or thick wiggles represent the propagators of summed over vector meson or glueball resonances. The thin lines or thin wiggles correspond to a single vector meson and proton. For scalar glueball resonances, due to the dilaton and the trace-full part of the metric fluctuation, we simply replace the bulk-to-bulk propagator Gh(k, z, z ) of spin-2 glueballs by G,f (k, z, z ).

B. Graviton and dilaton bulk action
Diffractive electro-production on a bulk Dirac fermion in holography, involves the exchange of tensor and scalar gravitons. The tensor graviton exchange is dual to a Reggeized tensor 2++ glueball, and the scalar graviton exchange is dual to a Reggeized scalar 0++ glueball. This is illustrated in the Witten diagram of Fig. 1. The generic effective action for these diagrams in AdS5 is given by

S = d5x e-2(z)g LEH (g, ) + d5x e-(z)g LDBI (, A, X)

(II.9)

with the Einstein-Hilbert action (EH) in the string frame for the metric g, -dilaton, and the DBI action for the Dirac
fermion , flavor gauge field A, and tachyon X. The additional dimensionally reduced string modes, not entering the present discussion, have been omitted. The AdS5 metric is chosen as gMN = (µ, -1)/z2 with µ mostly negative.
The fluctuations in the 4-dimensional part of the bulk metric, split into a transverse and traceless TT-part denoted
by h (tensor graviton) and a transverse and traceful T-part denoted by f (scalar glueball)

The decomposition (II.10) follows in the gauge where f, h decouple. However, they both obey identical equations of

4
motion since they carry the same anomalous dimensions T,S = 4 in the strict large Nc limit [16]. This is not the case at finite 1/Nc (which will be subsumed below). More specifically, the radial Regge spectrum of tensor and scalar glueballs, is [17]

with N = ~2N z2 for the nucleon field, and V = ~2V z2 for the heavy mesons s¯µs, c¯µc, ¯bµb or , J/, , respectively. The photon field follows from a similar reasoning with V = . All vector fields are massless in bulk, since they are
p = 1 forms with anomalous dimension V = 3,

m25 = ( - p)( + p - 4)  0

(II.14)

Their gauge-coupling to a background tachyon field X  qq¯ in bulk with a massive boundary condition X0  diag(mu, md, mc, mb), only generates a Higgs mass for the off-diagonal or charged flavor fields, the diagonal or neutral fields dual to , J/,  remain massless in bulk. A mass mc,b can be added by minimally modifying the dilaton potential (z), without affecting the traceless condition of TVµ.

D. Diffractive electro-production amplitude
The scalar dilaton coupling to the flavor vector fields vanishes in bulk, i.e. µTVµ = 0 in (II.13), and drops out of the diffractive process in Fig. 1 [2], for both the real and virtual incoming photons. As a result, the electro-production amplitude follows solely from the exchange of a tensor glueball or graviton,

III. DIFFERENTIAL AND TOTAL CROSS SECTIONS FOR ELECTRO-PRODUCTION

The differential cross section for electro-production of heavy mesons J/ (and also ) involves the exchange of a bulk j = 2 graviton near threshold, and higher spin away from threshold. We will postpone the higher spin exchanges and their Reggeization to later.

Note that (III.23) follows from the boundary-to-bulk vector propagator that resums the 1-- cc¯ radial Regge trajectory, in short the 1-- transition form factor [  cc¯] + graviton  J/.
The tensor form factor A(t) with t = -Q2 < 0, corresponds to the elastic vertex graviton + p  p. It is composed of the bulk-to-bulk graviton propagator which resums the 2++ radial Regge trajectory (III.26),

B. Far from threshold
Thedifferential cross sections (III.22) grow as s2 following the exchange of spin j = 2 as a tensor glueball in bulk. At larger s higher spin-j exchanges contribute. Their resummation Reggeizes leading to a soft Pomeron exchange. This transmutation from a graviton to a Pomeron was initially discussed in [8]. In this section we apply this resummation to the electro-production process.

A. J/ electro-production
In the J/ electro-production channel, we fix the t Hooft coupling  = 11.243 and ~J/ = 1.03784 GeV, for a mass MJ/ = 3.1 GeV and a decay constant fJ/ = 0.405 GeV. In Fig. 8 we show the Q2 dependence of the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse cross sections as in (III.50)

The overall and arbitrary normalization is NR = 0.6 for the blue-solid curve. The data are from the 2005 H1 collaboration at HERA [29]. The slow rise in the semi-logarithmic plot is consistent with the linear Q-behavior following from holography, since dL/dt  1/Q6 and dT /dt  1/Q8. Asymptotically, the effective size is fixed by the virtual photon size 1/Q.

The holographic cross section is in agreement with the reported data in the range 0  Q2  10 GeV2. This is expected since at higher Q2 the weak coupling regime sets in. This
observation is consistent with our recent analysis of neutrino-nucleon DIS scattering in holographic QCD [30]. Fig. 9a shows that the holographic Q2 dependence following from I~ is consistent with the data at low and intermediate values of Q2. This dependence originates from the bulk-to-boundary vector propagator (III.23) which re-sums the cc¯ radial
Regge trajectory.

B.  electro-production
Although most of our arguments and derivations are justified for the electro-production of the heavy meson J/ (and even better for ), we can minimally adjust them to describe the lighter  meson, with a weaker justification.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
The holographic photo-production of charmonium has shown that at threshold the differential cross section probes the tensor gravitational coupling. Away from threshold, the tensor Reggeizes to a Pomeron and the differential cross section probes the Reggeized coupling. We have now extended this analysis to the electro-production of charmonium with a similar observation for the differential cross section.
In the double limit of large Nc and strong coupling, only the tensor coupling or A-form factor drives the production of J/ (and also ) in the threshold region, and its Reggeized form way above threshold. A comparison to the available data at low and intermediate Q2 shows that the holographic t-dependence for the total differential cross section for charmonium photo- and electroproduction, is consistent with the recent GlueX data and the HERA data over a broad range of t|.
In holography, the Q2 dependence of the electroproduction of charmonium follows from the bulk-toboundary propagator sourced by the 1-- current at the boundary such as c¯µc. As a result, the longitudinal differential cross section asymptotes 1/Q6, and the transverse differential cross section asymptotes 1/Q8, in agreement with the hard scattering rules. At smaller Q2, the transverse differential cross section is about constant, while the longitudinal differential cross section vanishes as Q2. This limit is fixed by the finite size of charmonium. The holographic results compare well with the HERA data for low and intermediate Q2, but depart from the data at larger Q2 with the on-set of weak coupling and scaling.
Our results extend miniminally to the -channel. The total cross section and the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse cross sections are reasonably well reproduced at low and intermediate Q2, but the |t| dependence of

the differential cross section is slightly off. This is an indication that Reggeon exchange is likely important in this channel. More data with better accuracy would be welcome.

VIII. KINEMATICS OF THE p  V p PROCESS
We start by briefly reviewing the kinematics for the process p  V p. We first define the Lorentz scalars as s = W 2 = (p1+q1)2, and t = (p1-p2)2 = (q1-q2)2 where q1,2 are the four-vectors of the virtual photon and vector meson, respectively (note that we occasionally use the notation q  q1 and q  q2), and p1,2 are the four vector of the proton. Throughout we will work with mostly negative signature, i.e., µ = (+1, -1, -1, -1). Note that our convention is different from the mostly positive signature used in most holographic analyses.
We will work in the center-of-mass (CM) frame of the pair composed of the virtual photon  and the proton. In this frame, one can derive the mathematical relationships between the three-momenta of the virtual photon and vector meson (q, qV ) and Lorentz scalars (s, t, q12 = -Q2, q22 = MV2 , p21 = p22 = m2N ) as (see, for example, Eqs.11.2-4 in [24])

We consider AdS5 with a background metric gMN = (µ , -1)/z2 and µ = (1, -1, -1, -1). Confinement will be described by a background dilaton  = ~2V z2 for mesons,  = ~2N z2 for protons and  = 2~2N z2 for
glueballs in the soft wall model. The glueballs will be

described by hµ and the scalar-dilaton by . The flavor

The coupling g5 is inherited from the nature of the brane embeddings in bulk: 1/g52  3NcNf /(122) (D7branes), and 1/g52  (3 /25/2)NcNf /(122) (D9branes). The brane embeddings with Nf = 1 are more appropriate for describing heavy mesons in bulk, as the U(1) field mode decompose in an infinite tower of massive vector mesons on these branes as we discussed above. When ignoring these embedding, the standard assignement is: 1/g52  Nc/(122).
We note that in (IX.68), we have excluded a Yukawatype coupling between the scalar-dilaton  and the bulk Dirac fermion , since neither the fermionic part of the Type IIB supergravity action (see, for example, Eq. A.20 in [25]) nor the fermionic part of the DBI action in string theory (see, for example, Eq. 56 in [26]) support such a coupling.
B. Spectra
For the soft wall model, the vector meson spectrum follows from the equation of motion for V N . The results for the heavy meson masses and decay constants are [27]

with the twist factor  = 3. For the specific soft wall applications to follow we will set ~N = ~ for simplicity, unless specified otherwise.

C. Bulk graviton and dilaton
The effective action for the gravitaton (µ  µ + hµ) and scalar-dilaton fluctuations (   + ) follows from the Einstein-Hilbert action plus dilaton in the string frame. In de-Donder gauge and to quadratic order, we have

with

S = d5xg e-2 Lh+f + L ,

4~2V (n + 1)

2~V n + 1

(IX.71)

with n = n + c2V /4~2V . The additional constant cV is fixed as c2V /4~2V = MV2 /4~2V - 1 for n = 0 for the heavy mesons V = (J/, ), and c = 0 for the light mesons. The mass spectrum of the bulk Dirac fermions is given
by [18]

m2n = 4~2N (n +  - 1) ,

and g~52 = 22 = 16GN = 82/Nc2. The graviton in bulk is dual to a glueball on the boundary. We follow [16], and
split hµ into a traceless part h (tensor 2++ glueball) and and trace-full part f (scalar 0++ glueball)

= 0.

A further gauge fixing

Aµ = 0, allows to decouple the tensor glueball h. In con-

trast, the equations for f , H, and  (denoted as k in [16])

are coupled (see Eqs.7.16-20 in [16]). Diagonalizing the

equations, one can show that f satisfies the same equa-

tion of motion as h [16]. Also note that f0 = f (z = 0) couples to Tµµ of the gauge theory, while H0 = H(z = 0) couples to kµkTµ  0 (see Eq.7.6 of [16]).
The ensuing spectra for the tensor 2++ and scalar 0++
glueballs are degenerate [17]

m2T,S(n) = 8~2N n + 2

 (T : g~5fn, S : 2g~5fn)  2~N

(IX.76)

19

They differ from their vector meson counterparts in (IX.71) by the replacements ~V  2~N and g5  g~5 due to the difference in the bulk actions. The spectrum of the scalar-dilaton fluctuations and coupling are similar to the tensor glueball.

which makes the couplings and power counting manifest.Note that after this rescaling, the meson decay constants in (IX.71) and the glueball decay constants in (IX.76) redefine through g5fn  fn. This is understood in most of our analysis.
X. WAVEFUNCTIONS IN HOLOGRAPHIC QCD

The normalized wavefunctions for the bulk Dirac fermion are [18]

L(n)(), n~R = n~L~-N1 - 1 are the generalized Laguerre polynomials, and n~L = ~N 2/( ). The bulk wave functions are normalized

ary spinors are normalized as

(p, z) = R(z)0R(p) + L(z)0L(p) , ¯ (p, z) = R(z)¯ 0R(p) + L(z)¯ 0L(p) ,

(X.81)

C. Tansverse-traceless graviton/spin-2 glueballs

Similar relationships hold for the soft-wall model where the normalized wave function for spin-2 glueballs is given by [21] (note that the discussion in [21] is for general massive bulk scalar fluctuation but can be used for spin2 glueball which has an effective bulk action similar to massless bulk scalar fluctuation)

n(z) = cn z4Ln (j)-2(2) ,

Since the boundary value H(K, 0) = H(0, z) is arbitrary (1-point function), it follows that A(0) is not fixed in holography.
