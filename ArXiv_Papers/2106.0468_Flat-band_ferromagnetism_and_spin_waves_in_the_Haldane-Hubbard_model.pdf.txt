We study the flat-band ferromagnetic phase of the Haldane-Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice within a bosonization scheme for flat-band Chern insulators, focusing on the calculation of the spinwave excitation spectrum. We consider the Haldane-Hubbard model with the noninteracting lower bands in a nearly-flat band limit, previously determined for the spinless model, and at 1/4-filling of its corresponding noninteracting limit. Within the bosonization scheme, the Haldane-Hubbard model is mapped into an effective interacting boson model, whose quadratic term allows us to determine the spin-wave spectrum at the harmonic approximation. We show that the excitation spectrum has two branches with a Goldstone mode and Dirac points at center and at the K and K points of the first Brillouin zone, respectively. We also consider the effects on the spin-wave spectrum due to an energy offset in the on-site Hubbard repulsion energies and due to the presence of an staggered on-site energy term, both quantities associated with the two triangular sublattices. In both cases, we find that an energy gap opens at the K and K points. Moreover, we also find some evidences for an instability of the flat-band ferromagnetic phase in the presence of the staggered on-site energy term. We provide some additional results for the square lattice topological Hubbard model previous studied within the bosonization formalism and comment on the differences between the bosonization scheme implementation for the correlated Chern insulators on both square and honeycomb lattices.

I. INTRODUCTION
The tight-binding model on a honeycomb lattice with broken time-reversal symmetry proposed by Haldane [1] is an interesting example of a Chern band insulator [2, 3]. At half-filling, it can exhibit a quantized Hall conductance in the absence of an external magnetic field. This so-called anomalous quantum Hall effect [4] is indeed related to the fact that the electronic band structure of Haldane's model is topologically nontrivial, i.e., the corresponding Chern numbers of each band are finite [2, 3]. Interestingly, the model was experimentally implemented in a system with ultracold fermions in an optical honeycomb lattice [5] (see also the reviews [6, 7]).
A lot of effort has also been devoted to the study of the interplay between the topological properties of electronic band structures and the electron-electron interaction [3, 8]. A particular correlated Chern insulator that has been receiving some attention in recents years is a natural extension of Haldane's model [1], the so-called Haldane-Hubbard model [9­18]. Here the electronic spin is explicitly taken into account, time-reversal symmetry is broken, and correlation effects are described via an on-site Hubbard repulsion term [see Eq. (1) below]. At half-filling, the phase diagram of the Haldane-Hubbard model has been determined via different mean-field approaches [9­13] and numerical methods [15­18]. It was shown that the model supports a Chern insulator phase for weak interactions and a trivial N´eel magnetic ordered phase for strong ones. Moreover, there are evidences for a first-order transition between these two phases [18], but also for the presence of a distinct phase in the intermediate coupling region [9, 10, 17]. Differently from the time-reversal symmetric Kane-Mele Hubbard model [3], the breaking of time-reversal symmetry in the Haldane-

Hubbard model yields the so-called fermion sign problem, limiting the use of quantum Monte Carlo simulations [17, 18].
Away from half-filling, the study of correlation effects in Chern band insulators have also considered the possibility of realizing fractional quantum Hall phases in lattice models. Indeed, the interest in fractional Chern insulators [19­21] was motivated by the studies [22­24], which showed that a series of tight-binding models with only short-range hoppings can display nearly-flat and topologically nontrivial electronic bands once the model parameters are properly chosen. Due to the similarity between flat bands with nonzero Chern numbers and Landau levels realized in a two-dimensional electron gas, it was proposed that these lattice models could display a fractional quantum Hall effect for partially filled bands if electronelectron interaction is taking into account [22­24]. Indeed, numerical evidences for the stability of fractional Chern insulator phases were later reported [25, 26].
Correlation effects in a spinfull topological Hubbard model on a square lattice with nearly-flat noninteracting bands but at a commensurate filling were also discussed [27­29]. Here the noninteracting limit of the topological Hubbard model is given by the -flux model, whose parameters can be adjusted such that the band structure is given by two lower and two higher (doubly degenerated) nearly-flat bands separated by an energy gap [22]. At 1/4-filling (half-filling of the lower band), it was shown [27­29] that such topological Hubbard model can realize a flat-band ferromagnetic phase [30]. In particular, one of us calculated the spin-wave excitation spectrum of the flat-band ferromagnetic phase within a bosonization formalism [28]. For the corresponding correlated Chern insulator, it was shown that the spin-wave spectrum has one gapped excitation branch and one gapless one, with

ter of the first Brillouin zone and Dirac points at the K and K points [see Fig. 6(a), below]. Introducing an energy offset in the on-site Hubbard repulsion energies associated with the (triangular) sublattices A and B, one finds that an energy gap opens in the spin-wave excitation spectrum at the K and K points. The effects on the spin-wave spectrum due to the presence of a staggered on-site energy term related to the sublattices A and B is also discussed.
Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the Haldane-Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice and discuss in details the band structure of the noninteracting term close to the nearly flat-band limit determined in Ref. [22]. In Sec. III, we briefly review the bosonization scheme for flat-band Chern insulators [28]. Sec. IV is devoted to the description of the flat-band ferromagnetic phase of the Haldane-Hubbard model: we quote the expression of the effective interacting boson model derived within the bosonization scheme and determine the spinwave excitation spectra in the nearly flat-band limit and slightly away from this limit; the effects of an energy offset in the on-site Hubbard repulsion term and of a staggered on-site energy term are also discussed. In Sec. V, we discuss our results and provide a brief summary of our main findings. Details of the bosonization formalism are presented in Appendices A and B while additional results derived within the bosonization scheme for the topological Hubbard model on a square lattice previously studied in Ref. [28] are reported in Appendix C.

the Goldstone mode at the centre of the first Brillouin zone. These analytical results qualitatively agrees with the numerical ones determined via exact diagonalization [29].
In the present paper, we study the flat-band ferromagnetic phase of a correlated Chern insulator on a honeycomb lattice described by the Haldane-Hubbard model. We consider configurations close to the nearly-flat band limit of the lower (noninteracting) bands that was previously determined for the (spinless) Haldane model [22]. We describe the flat-band ferromagnetic phase of the Haldane-Hubbard model within the bosonization formalism for flat-band correlated Chern insulators proposed in Ref. [28]. Such a bosonization scheme is based on the method proposed to study the quantum Hall ferromagnetic phase of a two-dimensional electron gas at filling factor  = 1 [31]. It was later employed to described the quantum Hall ferromagnetic phases realized in graphene at filling factors  = 0 and  = ±1 [32]. We show that the bosonization scheme allow us to map the HaldaneHubbard model at the nearly-flat band limit of its lower band to an effective interacting boson model. Our main finding is the flat-band ferromagnetic phase spin-wave spectrum, which corresponds to the dispersion relation of the bosons determined from the effective boson model within a harmonic approximation. We find that the spinwave excitation spectrum has one gapped and one gapless excitation branches, with a Goldstone mode at the cen-

II. HALDANE-HUBBARD MODEL

Let us consider Ne spin-1/2 electrons on a honeycomb lattice described by the Haldane-Hubbard model, whose Hamiltonian is given by [9­18].

H = H0 + HU ,

Here the operator cia (cia) creates (destroys) an electron with spin  =,  on site i of the (triangular) sub-
lattice a = A, B of the honeycomb lattice. t1  0 and t2e±i with t2  0 are, respectively, the nearest-neighbor
and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings. One notices that

3

the electron acquires a + (-) phase as it moves in the same (opposite) direction of the arrows within the same sublattice [see dashed lines in Fig. 1(a)]. Indeed, the complex next-nearest-neighbor hopping t2e±i results in a fictitious flux pattern with zero net flux per unit cell [see, e.g, Fig. 1(a) from Ref. [22] for details]. The index  corresponds to the nearest-neighbor vectors [Fig. 1(a)]

In the following, we set the nearest-neigbhor distance to unit, i.e., a = 1. Finally, the HU term [Eq. (3)] is the onesite Hubbard repulsion term, which represents an energy cost paid by double occupation of site i, and

^ia = ciacia

(6)

is the density operator associated with electrons with spin  at site i of sublattice a. We consider that the one-site repulsion energy Ua > 0 can depend on the sublattice a.

A. Tight-binding term with nearly-flat topological bands

In this section, we discuss in details the noninteracting term H0 [Eq. (2)] of the Hamiltonian (1) and show that it can display an almost flat (lower) electronic band that is topologically nontrivial.
The first step to diagonalize the free-electron Hamiltonian (2) is to perform a Fourier transform,

cia

1 
Na

e-ik·Ri cka,
kBZ

(7)

where the momentum sum runs over the first Brillouin zone (BZ) [Fig. 1(b)] associated with the underline triangular Bravais lattice and Na = N is the number of sites of the sublattice a. It is then easy to show that the noninteracting Hamiltonian (2) can be written in a matrix form,

H0 = kHkk,

(8)

k

where the 4 × 4 Hk matrix reads

Hk =

hk 0 0 hk

(9)

and the four-component spinor k is given by

k = (ckA ckB ckA ckB)T .

(10)

The 2 × 2 matrices hk associated with each spin sector are such that hk = hk = hk, with the hk matrix given by

hk =

2t2  cos(k ·  + )

t1  eik·

t1  e-ik·

2t2  cos(k ·  - )

.

It is possible to write the hk matrix in terms of the identity matrix 0 and the vector ^ = (1, 2 ,3), whose components are Pauli matrices,

hk = B0,k0 + Bk · ^,

(11)

where the B0,k function and the components of the vector Bk = (B1,k, B2,k, B3,k) are given by

B0,k = 2t2 cos() cos(k ·  ),


B1,k = t1 cos(k · ),


B2,k = t1 sin(k · ),


B3,k = -2t2 sin() sin(k ·  ),

(12)



with the indices  and  corresponding to the nearest-
neighbor (4) and next-nearest-neighbor (5) vectors, respectively. The fact that the matrices hk related to each spin sector hk = hk = hk indicates that the noninteracting model (2) breaks time-reversal symmetry (see, e.g,
Appendix A from Ref. [28] for details).
The Hamiltonian (8) can be diagonalized via the
canonical transformation

dk = ukckA + vkckB, ck = vk ckA - ukckB,

(13)

where the coefficients uk and vk are given by

|uk|2

=

1 2

|vk|2

=

1 2

B^1,k + iB^2,k ,

1 - B^3,k

, (14)

with the hatted Bi standing for the i-component of the normalized vector B^ k = Bk/|Bk|. After the diagonalization, the Hamiltonian (8) then reads

H0 =

kc ckck + kddkdk,

k

(15)

with the dispersions of the lower band c (- sign) and the upper one d (+ sign) given by

kd/c = B0 ± B12,k + B22,k + B32,k.

FIG. 2. Band structure (16) of the noninteracting hopping term (2) (in units of the nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude t1) along paths in the first Brillouin zone [Fig. 1(b)] for different values of the next-nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude t2 and phase : (a) t2 = 0.3155 t1,  = 0 (green) and t2 = 0.3155 t1,  = 0.656 (magenta); (b)  = 0.4 (blue),  = 0.5 (green), and  = 0.656 (magneta), with t2 given by the relation cos() = t1/(4t2); and (c)  = 0.656 (magneta)  = 0.75 (green), and  = 0.85 (blue), with t2 given by the relation cos() = t1/(4t2).

Notice that both c and d free-electronic bands are doubly degenerated with respect to the spin degree of freedom.
Figure 2(a) shows the electronic bands (16) along paths in the first Brillouin zone [Fig. 1(b)] for two different parameter sets. For t2 = 0.3155 t1 and  = 0, the spectrum is gapless due to the presence of Dirac points at the K and K points, i.e., the upper and lower bands touch at these points and the bands disperse linearly with momentum around them. A finite phase  breaks time-reversal symmetry and opens a gap  between the lower and upper bands at the K and K points, as exemplified for the parameter choice t2 = 0.3155 t1 and  = 0.656. Moreover, a finite phase  yields free-electronic bands topologically nontrivial, since the corresponding Chern numbers [2, 22]

^

Cc/d

=

1 ±

d2kB^ k · (kx B^ k × ky B^ k)
BZ

(17)

are finite. One finds that Cc = +1 and Cd = -1 respectively for the lower and the upper bands regardless the spin. As mentioned in the Introduction, such nonzero Chern numbers combined with broken time-reversal symmetry indicates that the gapped phase of the noninteracting model (2) at half-filling is indeed a Chern band insulator [2, 3]. The phase diagram t2/t1 v.s.  for the noninteracting model (2) at half-filling can be found, e.g., in Ref. [11]: in addition to a (gapped) Chern band insulator phase with quantized Hall conductivity xy = ±e2/h per spin, the model also displays a Chern metal phase with nonquantized xy.
For the parameter choice (nearly flat-band limit)

t2 = 0.3155 t1 and  = 0.656,

(18)

one also sees that the lower band c is almost flat. Indeed,
such a choice obeys the relation cos() = t1/(4t2) =
3 3/43 [22] which yields a large flatness ratio for the
lower band fc = /Wc = 7, where  = min(d,k) - max(c,k) is the energy gap and Wc = max(kc ) - min(kc ) is the width of the lower band c. It is easy to see that the flatness ratio decreases as one moves away
from the optimal parameter choice (18). For instance, in

Fig. 2(b), we plot the band structure (16) for  = 0.4, 0.5, and 0.656 with t2 given by cos() = t1/(4t2). One notices that, as the phase  decreases, the flatness ratio fc also decreases, i.e., the energy gap at the K and K points decreases while the band width Wc of the lower band c increases. The flatness ratio fc also decreases for  > 0.656, see Fig. 2(c).
In the following, we consider configurations close to the nearly flat-band limit (18) of the lower band c. It is worth mentioning that previous studies [9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 18] about the Haldane-Hubbard model (1) focus on configurations with  = /2, which yields a particle-hole symmetric noninteracting band structure.
B. Staggered on-site energy term
An additional interesting term, that is also present in Haldane's original model [1], is a staggered on-site energy
FIG. 3. Band structure (16) of the noninteracting hopping term (2) with the additional staggered on-site energy term (19) (in units of the nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude t1) along paths in the first Brillouin zone for the next-nearestneighbor hopping amplitude t2 = 0.3155 t1, phase  = 0.656, and staggered on-site energy M = 0 (magenta), 0.1 (green), 0.2 (blue), and 0.3 t1 (orange).

term that breaks inversion-symmetry:

HM = M

ciAciA - ciBciB .

i

(19)

Adding the staggered on-site energy term (19) to the tight-binding model (2), one easily finds that the new Hamiltonian H0 + HM also assumes the form (8) with the B0,k and the Bi,k (i = 1, 2, 3) functions given by Eq. (12) apart from the replacement

B3,k  B3,k + M.

(20)

In Fig. 3, we plot the band structure (16) for the parameters (18) and M = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 t1. We notice that, for a finite on-site energy M > 0 (M < 0), the energy gap is located at the K (K) point. Moreover, as the parameter M increases, the energy gap decreases, the difference (Kc - Kc ) increases, and the flatness ratio of the lower band c decreases. Indeed, the increasing of the parameter M can induce a gap closure that destroys the topological phase, see Fig. 2 from Ref. [1].
In Sec. IV C below, we consider a finite staggered onsite energy M as a source of departure of the lower band c from the nearly flat-band limit (18).

C. Hubbard term in momentum space

The expression of the on-site Hubbard interaction (2) easily follows from the Fourier transform of the electron density operator (6), which is given by

1 ^ia = N

eiq·Ri ^a(q).

qBZ

(21)

Substituting Eq. (21) into the Hamiltonian (2), one finds

Schematic representation of (a) the ground state (26) of the noninteracting term (2) in the nearly-flat limit (18) of the lower band c at 1/4-filling and (b) the particle-hole pair excitation above the ground state (26). Although the free bands c and d are doubly degenerated with respect to the spin degree of freedom, an offset between the  = and  bands are introduced for clarity.

Once the expression of the projected density operator (24) is known, we can determine the projection H¯U of
the on-site Hubbard term (22) into the noninteracting lower bands c. Indeed, H¯U assumes the form (22) with
the replacement ^a(q)  ¯a(q), i.e.,

H¯ U

(22)

It is also useful to determine the expansion of the den-
sity operator ^a(k) in terms of the fermion operators ck a . With the aid of Eqs. (6), (7), and (21), one shows that

^a(q) =

cp-q a cp a .

p

(23)

The canonical transformation (13) allows us to express (23) in terms of the fermion operators ck  and dk . In particular, the density operator (23) projected into the lower noninteracting band c reads [28]

¯a (q) = Ga(p, q)cp-q cp ,
p

(24)

with the Ga(p, q) function given by Eq. (A3).

In this section, we briefly summarize the bosonization scheme for a Chern insulator introduced in Ref. [28] for the description of the flat-band ferromagnetic phase of a correlated Chern insulator on a square lattice.
Let us consider a spinfull Chern insulator on a bipartite lattice whose Hamiltonian assumes the form (8). We choose the model parameters such that (at least) the lower band c is (nearly-) flat and consider that the number of electrons Ne = NA = NB = N , where NA and NB are, respectively, the number of sites of the sublattices A and B. Such a choice corresponds to a 1/4-filling, i.e., the lower (nearly-flat) band c is half-filled. In particular, let us assume that the lower band c  is completely occupied, as illustrated in Fig. 4(a). In this case, the ground state of the noninteracting system (the reference state) is completely spin polarized and it can be written as a product of single particle states,

|FM =

ck|0 .

kBZ

(26)

6

Since the lower flat bands c are separated from the upper bands d by an energy gap, the lowest-energy neutral excitations above the ground state (26) are given by particle-hole pairs within the lower bands c, i.e., they are spin-flips that can be written as [see Fig. 4(b)]

|k  Sk-|FM .

(27)

It is possible to show that such particle-hole pair excitations can be treated approximated as bosons. Indeed, one can define the boson operators

(29)

and whose vacuum state is given by the (reference) spinpolarized state (26), i.e.,

b,q|FM = 0.

(30)

Here the operators S¯q±, are linear combinations of projected spin operators associated with sublattices A and
B,

S¯q±, = S¯q±,A + (-1)S¯q±,B,

(31)

with  = 0, 1 and S¯q±,a = S¯qx,a ±iS¯qy,a. The operator S¯q,a, with  = x, y, z, is the -component of the spin operator Sq,a projected into the lower bands c with Sq,a being the Fourier transform of the spin operator Si,a at site i of the sublattice a. Indeed, the projected operator S¯q,a is determined from Si,a following the same procedure outlined in Sec. II C for the density operator (24). Finally,
the F,q function is given by

F2,q =

g(p, q)g(p, q),

p

(32)

with the g(p, q) function being related to the coefficients (14) of the canonical transformation (13),

g(p, q) = vp-qvp + (-1)up-qup.

(33)

Any operator expanded in terms of the fermion operators ck and ck can, in principle, be rewritten in terms of the bosons (28). In particular, the density operator
(24) projected into the lower bands c assumes the form

1 ¯a(k) = 2 N ,k,0 +

Ga(k, q)b,k+qb,q,

, q

(34)

where the Ga(k, q) function is given by Eq. (A2). Importantly, both F2,q and Ga(k, q) functions can be explicitly written in terms of the coefficients (12), see
Eqs. (A1) and (A4), respectively.

IV. FLAT-BAND FERROMAGNETISM IN THE HALDANE-HUBBARD MODEL
In this section, we study the flat-band ferromagnet phase of the Haldane-Hubbard model (1) within the bosonization formalism [28] for flat-band Chern insulators. In particular, we concentrate on the determination of the dispersion relation of the elementary (neutral) particle-hole pair excitations, i.e., we calculate the spectrum of the spin-wave excitations above the (flat-band) ferromagnetic ground state (26).

A. Effective interacting boson model

Let us consider the Haldane-Hubbard model (1) on a honeycomb lattice with the noninteracting lower bands c in the nearly-flat band limit (18) and at 1/4-filling of its corresponding noninteracting limit, i.e., we assume that the number of electrons Ne = NA = NB = N , with NA and NB being the number of sites of the (triangular) sublattices A and B, respectively. In this case, the bosonization scheme [28] allows us to map the Hamiltonian (1) into an effective interacting boson model.
In order to derive such an effective boson model, the first step is to project the Hamiltonian (1) into the lower noninteracting bands c (see Eq. (28) from Ref. [28] for details):

H  H¯ = H¯0 + H¯U .

(35)

Here the projected noninteracting term H¯0 follows from Eq. (15),

H¯0 =

kc ckck,

k

(36)

while the projected on-site Hubbard term H¯U is given by
Eq. (25). The expression of the noninteracting (kinetic) term H¯0 in terms of the bosons (28) is given by (see

with the F,q and the g(p, q) functions given by Eqs. (32) and (33), respectively. The bosonic representation of the projected on-site Hubbard term H¯U follows from Eqs. (25) and (34): After normal ordering the ex-
pression resulting from the substitution of Eq. (34) into
(25), one shows that [28]

H¯U,B = H¯U(2,B) + H¯U(4,B) ,

The effective interacting boson model that describes the flat-band ferromagnetic phase of the Haldane-Hubbard model (1) then assumes the form

H¯B = H¯0,B + H¯U(2,B) + H¯U(4,B) .

(44)

B. Spin-wave spectrum in the nearly flat-band limit
In this section, we consider the effective boson model (44) in the lowest-order (harmonic) approximation,

which consists of keeping only terms up to quadratic order in the boson operators (28) of the Hamiltonian (44), i.e., we consider

H¯B  H¯0,B + H¯U(2,B) .

(45)

In principle, the Hamiltonian (45) can be diagonalized

via a canonical transformation yielding the spectrum

of elementary excitations (spin-waves) in terms of ¯q

[Eq. (38)] and

 q

[Eq.

(42)].

However, before proceed-

ing, we would like to discuss both contributions in details.

The coefficient ¯q [Eq. (38)] represents the (kinetic) contribution to the energy of the elementary excitations

explicitly related to the dispersion of the noninteracting

(lower) bands c. One can see that, if the free band c is

completely flat (qc = constant), this coefficient vanishes while, in the nearly flat-band limit, it can be finite. For

the noninteracting term (2) on the honeycomb lattice in

the nearly flat-band limit (18), we find that ¯q = 0 while ¯q01 = ¯q10 are finite but rather small in units of the nearest-neighbor hopping energy t1 [see Fig. 5(a)]. Such
a result is distinct from the square lattice -flux model,

where symmetry considerations yield ¯q = 0 [28]. We believe that the finite values of the coefficients ¯q01 and ¯q10 for the Haldane model might be related not only to the symmetries of the noninteracting Hamiltonian (2),

but also to the fact that the condition

F,q = , F,q

(46)

is not fulfilled for the Haldane model, an important fea-

ture distinct from the square lattice -flux model. We

refer the reader to Appendix B for a detailed discussion

about the implications of the condition (46) for the ap-

proximations involved in the bosonization scheme. Due to the smallness of ¯q01 and ¯q10, in the following, we assume that ¯q  0, i.e., we neglected the (explicit) kinetic contribution (38) to the energy of the elementary

excitations.

Concerning the coefficients (42), which are related to

the one-site Hubbard term (3), we find that

Hermitian. Such a feature is also in contrast with the

square lattice -flux model [28] for which

01 q

(see also Ref. [33]). In particular, for the nearly flat-band

limit (18), one finds that

01 q

is

quite

pronounced

around

the M1 and M2 points and it is also finite close to the K

and K points of the first Brillouin zone [see Fig. 5(b)].

Again, we believe that the non-Hermiticity of the Hamil-

tonian H¯U(2,B) might be an artefact of the bosonization scheme related to the fact that the condition (46) is not

fulfilled for the Haldane model (see Appendix B for de-

tails). Since such an issue is not completely understood

at the moment, in the following, we determine the spin-

wave spectrum both in the presence and in the absence

of the off-diagonal terms (, ) = (0, 1) and (1, 0) of the

Hamiltonian (40).

The Hamiltonian (45) with ¯q = 0 can be diagonalized via a canonical transformation similar to Eq. (13),

b0,q = uqa+,q + vqa-,q, b1,q = vq a+,q - uqa-,q,

(47)

where the coefficients uq and vq are now given by

It is then easy to show that the Hamiltonian (45) assumes the form

H¯B = E0 +

µ=± qBZ

(50)

where the constant E0 = k kc = (-1.69 t1)N for the nearly flat-band limit (18) and the dispersion relation of

reduces

to

One notices that the ground state of the Hamiltonian

(50) is the vacuum (reference) state for both bosons b0,1 and a±, which corresponds to the spin-polarized ferromagnet state |FM [see Eqs. (26) and (30)]. Such a result

The dashed blue line indicates the imaginary part of +,q = --,q [see Eq. (51)], which is multiplied by a factor of 50 for clarity. On-site repulsion energies: (a) UA = UB = U ; (b) UB = 0.8 UA = 0.8 U ; and (c) UB = 0.6 UA = 0.6 U .
is a first indication of the stability of a flat-band ferromagnetic phase for the Haldane-Hubbard model (1).
The dispersion relations (51) and (52) of the bosons a±, which indeed corresponds to the spin-wave spectrum above the flat-band ferromagnetic ground state (26), for the nearly flat-band limit (18) and UA = UB = U is shown in Fig. 6(a). Due to the absence of the kinetic coefficients (38) associated with the dispersion of the noninteracting bands c, one sees that the energy scale of the spin-wave spectrum is determined by the on-site repulsion energy U . Both spin-wave spectra (51) and (52)

9

have two branches: the acoustic (lower) branch -,q is

gapless, with a Goldstone mode at the Brillouin zone cen-

ter ( point) and the characteristic quadratic dispersion

of ferromagnetic spin-waves near the  point; the opti-

cal (upper) one +,q is gapped, with the lowest energy excitation at the K and K points. The presence of the

Goldstone mode indicates the stability of the flat-band

ferromagnetic phase. Interestingly, for the dispersion re-

lation (52), one finds a quite small energy gap at the K

and K points ((K) = +,K - -,K = 2.01 × 10-3 U ) while the excitation spectrum (51) displays Dirac points

at the K and K points. Indeed, the presence of the Dirac

points is related to the fact that

01 q

and

10 q

are

finite

at

the K and K points, see Fig. 5(b). Moreover, the fact

that

01 q

10 q

yields

a

small

decay

rate

(the

imag-

inary part of ±,q) for the spin-wave excitations (51) at

the border of the first Brillouin zone [see the dashed line

in Fig. 6(a) and note the multiplicative factor 50].

In addition to a configuration with homogeneous onsite Hubbard energy UA = UB = U , we also consider the Haldane-Hubbard model with a sublattice dependent on-site Hubbard energy. The spin-wave spectra (51) and (52) for the nearly flat-band limit (18) and with UB = 0.8 UA = 0.8 U and UB = 0.6 UA = 0.6 U are shown in Figs. 6(b) and (c), respectively. One notices that both spin-wave spectra (51) and (52) have a Goldstone mode at the  point, the energies of the excitations decreases as the diference U = UA -UB increases, and the difference between the energies at the K and K points (e.g., -,K - -,K ) also increases with U . For UB > UA, we find similar features, but the energy at the K point is lower than the one at the K point. Importantly, the dispersion relation (52) has a small gap at the K and K points, similar to the homogeneous case UA = UB: (K) = 1.81 × 10-3 U (U = 0.2 U ) and 1.61 × 10-3 U (U = 0.4 U ). On the other hand, for the dispersion relation (51), a finite energy gap opens at the K and K points in contrast with the homogeneous case U = 0. One finds that (K) = 3.18 × 10-2 U (U = 0.2 U ) and 6.40 × 10-2 U (U = 0.4 U ). Such a finite energy gap might be related to the fact that a Hubbard term with UA = UB breaks inversion symmetry. Similar to the homogeneous configuration, the spin-wave excitations (51) at the first Brillouin zone border have a finite decay rate.

Gu and collaborators [35] performed exact diagonalization calculations and determined the spin-wave spectrum for the Haldane-Hubbard model (1) in the nearly flat-band limit (18) neglecting the dispersion of the noninteracting electronic bands, which corresponds to the approximation ¯q = 0 considered above. For homogeneous on-site Hubbard energies UA = UB, it was found that the spin-wave spectrum has Dirac points at the K and K points (see Fig. 2(a1) from Ref. [35]) while, for a finite U , the energies of the excitations decrease with U and energy gaps open at the K and K points (see Figs. 2(b1) and 2(c1) from Ref. [35]). Remarkably, the spin-wave spectrum (51) determined within the bosoniza-

tion scheme qualitatively agrees with the numerical one,

apart from the fact that the numerical results do not in-

dicate a finite decay rate.

One should mention that the presence of Dirac points

at the K and K points is not only a feature of the spin-

wave spectrum of the flat-band ferromagnetic phase of

the Haldane-Hubbard model. Indeed, recent exact di-

agonalization calculations [36] for a topological Hubbard

model on a kagome lattice also indicate such a feature in

the excitation spectrum of the corresponding flat-band

ferromagnetic phase when the dispersion of the (lower)

noninteracting electronic band is neglected.

As mentioned above, although the non-Hermiticity

of the Hamiltonian (40) (and consequently finite decay

rates) might be an artefact of the bosonization scheme,

the off-diagonal terms

01 q

and

10 q

of

the

quadratic

Hamil-

tonian (40) should be considered in order to properly de-

scribe the spin-wave spectrum at the border of the first

Brillouin zone. Therefore, in the following, we determine

the spin-wave spectrum away from the nearly flat-band

limit (18) with the aid of Eq. (51).

C. Spin-wave spectrum away from the nearly flat-band limit
Although the main focus of our discussion is the description of the flat-band ferromagnetic phase of the Haldane-Hubbard model in the nearly-flat band limit (18), we also consider configurations such that the noninteracting band c has smaller flatness ratio fc < 7. In particular, we consider the effects on the spin-wave spectrum (51) related to the increasing of the band width Wc (decreasing of the flatness ratio fc) of the noninteracting band c due to (i) the decrease/increase of the phase  [see Figs. 2(b) and (c)] and (ii) the presence of a staggered on-site energy term (19) in the total Hamiltonian (see Fig. 3). These perturbations furnish some clues about the stability of the flat-band ferromagnetic phase.
In Fig. 7(a), we show the spin-wave spectrum (51) for  = 0.4, 0.5, and 0.656, the hopping amplitude t2 given by the relation cos() = t1/(4t2), and the on-site repulsion energy UA = UB = U . One sees that the spin-wave spectrum (in units of the on-site repulsion energy U ) for  = 0.4 and 0.5 is quite similar to the one derived for the nearly-flat band limit (18). As the flux parameter  decreases, the excitation energies near the border of the Brillouin zone [the K-M1-K line] decrease, while the energies of the optical branch in the vicinity of the  point increase. The fact that the spin-wave spectrum displays a Goldstone mode at the  point, regardless the value of the phase , indicates the stability of the flat-band ferromagnetic phase with respect to the simultaneous variations of the phase  and the next-nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude t2. Finite decay rates are still found at the border of the first Brillouin zone. The flat-band ferromagnetic phase seems also to be stable for  > 0.656, see Fig. 7(b). Here, however, as the flux parameter  increases, the ex-

Figure 8(b) shows the spin-wave spectrum (51) with
the replacement (53) (in units of the nearest-neighbor
hopping amplitude t1) for the optimal parameters (18), M = 0.1 and 0.2 t1, and the on-site Hubbard energy UA = UB = U = t1. One notices that ¯q does not modify the excitation energies in the vicinity of the  point,
but only changes the excitation energies near the bor-
der K-M1-K of the first Brillouin zone. Such an effect resembles the one found when distinct on-site repulsion
energies UA = UB are considered, see Figs. 6(b) and (c).

V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

FIG. 7. The real part of the dispersion relation (51) (solid line) along paths in the first Brillouin zone [Fig. 1(b)] for on-site repulsion energy UA = UB = U and t2 given by the relation cos() = t1/(4t2). (a)  = 0.4 (blue),  = 0.5 (green),  = 0.656 (magneta) and (b)  = 0.656 (magneta),  = 0.75 (green),  = 0.85 (blue). The corresponding dashed line indicates the imaginary part of +,q = --,q [see Eq. (51)], which is multiplied by a factor of 50 for clarity.
citation energies near the border of the Brillouin zone increase and the energies of the upper branch in the vicinity of the  point decrease.
The effect on the spin-wave spectrum of a finite staggered on-site energy M [Eq. (19)] is quite distinct. In Fig. 8(a), we plot the spin-wave spectrum (51) for the optimal parameters (18), M = 0.1 and 0.2 t1, and the on-site Hubbard energy UA = UB = U = t1. Comparing with the homogeneous on-site energy M = 0 configuration [Fig. 6(a)], one sees that the whole spin-wave spectrum shifts downward in energy as M increases and energy gaps open at the K and K points. The latter is indeed related to the fact that the staggered on-site energy term (19) breaks inversion symmetry. Most importantly, the energies of the acoustic branch are negative in the vicinity of the  point, indicating an instability of the flat-band ferromagnetic phase for finite values of the staggered on-site energy M . Such features are also found for the square lattice -flux model [28], see Fig. 10 in Appendix C.
A finite staggered on-site energy M also modifies the (kinetic) coefficients (38) directly related to the dispersion of the noninteracting band c. In particular, we find that ¯q no longer vanishes for a finite M [see Fig. 5(a)

The effective boson model (44) is not only restricted to the Haldane-Hubbard model (1) on a honeycomb lattice, but, in principle, it can also be employed to study the flatband ferromagnetic phase of a correlated Chern insulator described by a topological Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice whose noninteracting (kinetic) term breaks timereversal symmetry and assumes the form (8): Notice that a tight-binding model of the form (8) is completely defined by the B0,k and Bi,k (i = 1, 2, 3) functions (12); the F,q function, which is important in the definition of the boson operators (28), can be written in terms of the normalized B^i,k = Bi,k/|Bi,k| functions, see Eq. (A1); finally, the coefficients (38) and (42) and the boson-boson interaction (43), which completely characterise the effective boson model (44), can also be expressed in terms of the normalized B^i,k functions, see Appendix A.
An important requirement for the application of the bosonization scheme [28] to a topological Hubbard model is that the condition (46) is fulfilled by the noninteracting term of the model. Once the validity of such a condition is verified, the two sets of independent boson operators (28) can be defined and the bosonic representation of a operator written in terms of the original fermions, such as the projected density operator (24), is well defined. This is indeed the case for the square lattice topological Hubbard model whose noninteracting limit is giving by the -flux model [28]. As mentioned above, the spinwave spectrum [29] determined via exact diagonalization calculations for the flat-band ferromagnetic phase of the square lattice -flux model in the (completely) flat-band limit qualitatively agrees with the harmonic one calculated within the bosonization formalism. Additional results for the square lattice -flux model derived within the bosonization scheme are presented in Appendix C.
For the Haldane-Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice in the nearly-flat band limit (18) of the noninteracting (lower) band c (the second application of the bosonization formalism), the condition (46) is not fulfilled for all momenta q [see Fig. 9(b)], which implies that

The real part of the dispersion relation (51) (solid line) along paths in the first Brillouin zone [Fig. 1(b)] for the optimal parameters (18), on-site Hubbard energy UA = UB = U = t1, and staggered on-site energy M = 0.1 (magenta) and 0.2 t1 (green). (b) Similar results for the spin-wave spectrum (51), but with the replacement (53). The corresponding dashed line indicates the imaginary part of +,q = --,q [see Eq. (51)], which is multiplied by a factor of 50 for clarity.

additional considerations are needed in order to apply the

bosonization scheme. As discussed in Appendix B, in or-

der to preserve the form of the original effective boson

model (44), one should assume that the two set of bo-

son operators b0,1 defined by Eq. (28) are independent and that the bosonic expression (34) for the projected

electron density operator ¯a(k) holds for the Haldane model. Moreover, although the non-Hermiticity of the

quadratic Hamiltonian (40) might be related to the fact

that the condition (46) is not completely valid for the

Haldane model, one should keep the off-diagonal terms

01 q

and

10 q

[see

Eq.

(42)]

in

order

to

properly

describe

the spin-wave excitations at the border of the first Bril-

louin zone (see Fig. 6) as indicated by the comparison

between the dispersion relations (51) and (52) and the

numerical results [35]. Importantly, it is not clear at

the moment whether the finite decay rates found for

high-energy spin-wave excitations are an artefact of the

bosonization scheme. Even considering these additional

approximations, the qualitatively agreement between the

real part of the dispersion relation (51) and the numerical

spin-wave spectrum [35] indicates that the effective boson

model (44) provides an appropriated description for the

flat-band ferromagnetic phase of the Haldane-Hubbard

model.

In addition to the nearly-flat band limit (18), we also
study the flat-band ferromagnetic phase of the Haldane-
Hubbard model when the noninteracting lower band c
gets more dispersive. While the ferromagnetic phase
seems to be less sensible to the increase of the band
width Wc of the noninteracting band c due to variations of the phase  and the next-nearest neighbor amplitude t2 (Fig. 7), an instability of the ferromagnetic ground state
is found when a staggered on-site energy (19) is included
[Fig. 8(a) and (b)]. Interestingly, for the latter, one notices that the F2,q function and Im F021,q = Im F120,q are not affected by a finite staggered on-site energy M , while Re F021,q = Re F120,q acquire a constant value proportional to the staggered on-site energy M [see Figs. 9(b) and
(c)]: indeed, it is easy to see that the replacement (20)

modifies the second term of the integrand (A1), yielding an additional term proportional to the parameter M . Notice that the instability of a flat-band ferromagnetic phase due to a finite M is also related to a stronger violation of the condition (46). At the moment, it is not clear whether such an instability is an artefact of the bosonization scheme related to some difficulties in including kinetic effects, see the discussion below. Interestingly, such kind of instability is also found for the square lattice -flux model, see Appendix C for details.
The stability of a flat-band ferromagnetic phase was studied by Kusakabe and Aoki via exact diagonalization calculations performed for the two-dimensional Mielke model [37] and Mielke and Tasaki models [38]. A parameter  was introduced in the original models, such that  = 0 corresponds to (lower) noninteracting bands completely flat (flat-band limit). It was found that, for  = 0, a ferromagnetic phase is stable regardless the value of the on-site repulsion energy U . For finite values of the parameter  (system away from the flat-band limit), a ferromagnetic ground state is stable only if U  Uc() (see Figs. 1 and 2 from Ref. [38]). Such a scenario agrees with more recently numerical results for the square lattice -flux model in the nearly-flat band limit [29], which indicates that a ferromagnetic phase sets in only if U  Uc(t2), with t2 being the next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitude. Mu¨ller et al. studied one- and twodimensional Hubbard models with nearly-flat bands that are not in the class of Mielke and Tasaki flat-band models, since they do not obey some connectivity conditions [39]. They found that small and moderate noninteracting band dispersion may stabilize a ferromagnetic phase for U  Uc, i.e., the ferromagnetic phase is driven by the kinetic energy. In particular, for a two-dimensional bilayer model, Uc(l) is a nonmonotonic function of the parameter l that controls the width of the band (see Fig. 7 from [39]), i.e., the ferromagnetic phase sets in only for a finite band dispersion. For rigorous results about the stability of a ferromagnetic phase on Hubbard models with nearly-flat bands, we refer the reader to the review by

12

Tasaki [40].

The fact that a ferromagnetic phase is stable in Hubbard models with nearly-flat (noninteracting) bands only for U  Uc is related to the competition between the kinetic energy (dispersion of the noninteracting bands) and the (short-range) Coulomb interaction U [40]. The bosonization formalism [28] partially takes into account such a competition: although the explicitly contribution (38) of the dispersion of the noninteracting bands c is not included in the effective boson model (44), such kinetic effects are partially considered by the bosonization scheme, since the coefficients (42) and the boson-boson interaction (43) depend on the B^i,q functions (12) that completely determines the free-band structure (16). At the moment, it is not clear how to properly include in the effective boson model (44) the main effects related to the noninteracting band dispersion. Due to this limitation, we expected that the results derived within the bosonization scheme for flat-band Chern insulators get more accurate as the (lower) noninteracting bands gets less dispersive. One should recall that the bosonization scheme [28] is based on the formalism [31] that was proposed to describe the quantum Hall ferromagnet realized in a two-dimensional electron gas at filling factor  = 1: here, the noninteracting bands corresponds to (completely flat) Landau levels.

Concerning the topological properties of the spin-wave

excitations, one would expect that the nontrivial topolog-

ical properties of the noninteracting electronic bands of

the Haldane-Hubbard model may yield a flat-band ferro-

magnetic phase with topologically non-trivial spin-wave

excitation bands. Indeed, topological magnons in Heisen-

berg ferromagnets [41­46] and, in particular, magnets on

a honeycomb lattice [43­46] have been studied. An im-

portant ingredient for such topological magnon insulators

is the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that may open

energy gaps in the magnon spectrum and yields magnon

bands with nonzero Chern numbers. For the Haldane-

Hubbard model in the nearly flat-band limit (18), it was

shown that the spin-wave excitation bands have nonzero

Chern numbers only when the dispersion of the noninter-

acting electronic bands is explicitly taking into account

(see Figs. 2(a1), (a2) and (d) from [35]). We calculate the Chern numbers of the spin-wave bands for configu-

rations of the Haldane-Hubbard model whose spin-wave

spectrum displays an energy gap at the K and K points:

we expand the Hamiltonian (45) in terms of Pauli matri-

ces as done in Eq. (11), determine the corresponding Bi,q

coefficients assuming that

01 q

=

(

1q0),

and

calculate

the

Chern numbers using Eq. (17). In agreement with the

exact diagonalization results [35], we find that the Chern

numbers of the spin-wave bands vanish.

In summary, in this paper we studied the flat-band ferromagnetic phase of a correlated Chern insulator on a honeycomb lattice described by the Haldane-Hubbard model. We considered the system at 1/4-filling of the

noninteracting bands and in the nearly-flat band limit of the noninteracting lower bands. We determined the spinwave excitation spectrum within a bosonization scheme for flat-band correlated Chern insulators and found that it has a Goldstone mode at the first Brillouin zone center and Dirac points at the K and K points. We also studied how the spin-wave excitation spectrum changes as an offset in the on-site Hubbard energies associated with the sublattices A and B is introduced and as the width of the lower noninteracting bands increase due to variations of the kinetic term parameters and the presence of a staggered on-site energy term. In particular, we found that the flat-band ferromagnetic phase might be unstable when a finite staggered on-site energy term is included in the kinetic term of the Haldane-Hubbard model.
The bosonization scheme for flat-band correlated Chern insulators provides an effective interacting boson model for the description of the flat-band ferromagnetic phase of a topological Hubbard model. In the near future, we intend to study the effects of the boson-boson interaction not only in the Haldane-Hubbard model, but also in the square lattice -flux model previously studied in Ref. [28]. Motivated by the similarities with the quantum Hall ferromagnetic phase realized in a two-dimensional electron gas at filling factor  = 1 [31], we would like to check whether the boson-boson interaction may yield two-boson bound states.
It would be interesting to see whether the bosonization formalism [28], eventually combined with the approximations discussed in this paper, can also be employed to study twisted bilayer graphene near a magic angle [47­ 54]. Here the resulting moir´e pattern induces an effective superlattice and a set of flat-minibands in the moir´e Brillouin zone. In addition to a superconducting phase [47, 48], evidences for a ferromagnetic phase at 3/4-filling of the conduction miniband are also found [49]. In principle, a possible flat-band ferromagnetic phase of the effective lattice model introduced in Ref. [53] for twisted bilayer graphene could be studied within the bosonization scheme.
Finally, we should mention that a similar study reported in this paper for a correlated flat-band Z2 topological insulator on a honeycomb lattice, described by a topological Hubbard model similar to Eq. (1) but that preserves time-reversal symmetry, is currently in progress and it will be published elsewhere. For  = /2, such a model corresponds to the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model, see Ref. [3] for details.

The expansion of the Ga(k, q) function easily follows from Eq. (A4), since Ga(k, q) = -Ga(-k, -q).

Appendix B: Details about the bosonization scheme ences between the application of the bosonization formal-
In this section, we provide some details about the definition of the boson operators (28) and discuss the differ-

14

ism for the Haldane model and the square lattice -flux model [28]. Indeed, the application of the bosonization scheme [28] for the Haldane model on a honeycomb lattice requires further approximations as compare to the case of the square lattice -flux model.
As mentioned in Sec. III, the boson operators (28) are defined in terms of projected spin operators in momentum space:

b,q  S¯-+q,

and

b,q  S¯q-,.

In terms of the fermion operators ck  and ck  (associated with the lower noninteracting band c), the commutator between the projected spin operators S¯-+q, and S¯q-, reads

[S¯q+,, S¯q-, ] =

g(p - q , q)g(p, q )cp-q-q cp 

p

- g(p, q)g(p - q, q )cp-q-q cp  , (B1)

with the g(p, q) function giving by Eq. (33). One sees that Eq. (B1) is different from the canonical commutation relation (29) for boson operators. However, as long as we are close to the ferromagnetic state (26), i.e., the number of particle-hole pair excitations is small, one can assume that

cp-q cp   FM|cp-q cp |FM = q,0, cp-q cp   FM|cp-q cp |FM = 0,

(B2)

and therefore, the commutator (B1) now reads

[S¯+q,, S¯-q , ]  q,-q F2,q,

(B3)

where the F,q function is defined by Eq. (32). The commutator (B3) indicates that the particle-hole pair ex-
citations (27) can be treated approximated as bosons.
The bosonization formalism for flat-band Chern insula-
tors [28] is indeed based on the assumption (B2).
For the square lattice -flux model [28], it was found
that the condition (46) holds, and therefore, Eq. (B3) al-
lows us to define two sets of independent boson operators
b0 and b1 as done in Eq. (28). On the other hand, for the Haldane model (2) on the honeycomb lattice, the condi-
tion (46) is not fulfilled, as exemplified in Figs. 9(a) and (b) for the nearly-flat band limit (18). Since F2,q are real quantities, the imaginary parts of F021,q and F120,q are finite only in the vicinity of the M1 and M2 points, and |F021,q|, |F120,q| < |F2,q|, we assume that, for the Haldane model, bosons operators b0 and b1 can still be defined by Eq. (28) and that they constitute two sets of
independent boson operators.
A second important distinction between the Haldane
and square lattice -flux models is associated with the
determination of the bosonic representation of operators
written in terms of the fermion operators cq , such as the

projected electron density operator ¯a(k) [Eq. (34)]. As discussed in Sec. III.B from Ref. [28], such a procedure
is based on the fact that one can define the product of fermion operators cp-q cp  in terms of the boson operators b, i.e.,

cp-q cp  

h(p, q)b,q.



(B4)

For the square lattice -flux model, where the condition (46) holds, it is easy to see that the h(p, q) function is given by

h(p, q)

=

1 F,q

g

(p,

q),

(B5)

since the substitution of Eqs. (B4) and (B5) into (28) yields

b,q

=

1 F,q



h(p, q)g(p, q) b,q
p

1 =
F,q



, F2,q F,q

b,q

=

b,q,

(B6)

see also Eq. (32). For the Haldane model on the hon-

eycomb lattice, the choice (B5) for the h(p, q) function seems to be not appropriated, since the condition (46)

is no longer valid. Due to the involved expansion of the

g(p, q) function in terms of the coefficients (12) (not shown here), it is difficult to determine an h(p, q) function such that the identity (B6) is satisfied. Therefore,

based on the same assumptions considered in the def-

inition of the boson operators b and discussed in the previous paragraph, we also assume that Eq. (B5) [and

consequently Eq. (34)] holds for the Haldane model.

As discussed in Sec. IV B, one important consequence

of the fact that the condition (46) is not fulfilled for

the Haldane model is that the coefficients ¯q01 and ¯q10 [Eq. (38)] are finite and the coefficients (42) obey the

relation

01 q

=

-

1q0,

yielding

a

non-Hermitian

quadratic

boson Hamiltonian (40). It is indeed easy to understand

the relation between these results once we compare the

integrand of Eq. (32) with the ones of Eqs. (38) and

(A2): Notice that all of them depend on the product

g(x, y)g(x , y ); for  = , additional terms might be

included in the Ga(k, q) function, yielding

01 q

=

-

10 q

.

In principle, the condition

01 q

=

(

10 q

)

could

be

restore,

once an appropriated choice for the h(p, q) function

were done such that the identity (B6) is now verified.

Appendix C: Square lattice -flux model
In this section, we present additional results derived within the bosonization formalism for the flat-band ferromagnetic phase of the topological Hubbard model on a square lattice, whose noninteracting limit is given by the

[28] for details): (a) Next-nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes t2 = 1/ 2 andon-site repulsion energy UB = 0.8UA = 0.8 U (magenta) and UB = 0.6UA = 0.6 U (green); (b) UA = UB = U and t2 = 1/ 2 (magenta), 0.4 (green), and 0.3 t1 (blue); (c) t2 = 1/ 2, UA = UB = U , and staggered on-site energy M = 0.1 (magenta) and 0.2 t1 (green).

-flux model, previously studied in Ref. [28]. We follow the lines of Secs. IV B and IV C and find that the spinwave spectra of both square lattice -flux and Haldane models display the same features.
Figure 10(a) shows the spin-wave spectrum (51) for the nearly flat-band limit of the square lattice -flux model (which corresponds to the configuration withthe next-nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude t2 = t1/ 2) and on-site repulsion energies UB = 0.8 UA = 0.8 U and UB = 0.6 UA = 0.6 U . A comparison with the spin-wave spectrum obtained for the homogeneous case UB = UA = U (see Fig. 4 from Ref. [28] and Fig. 10(b)) indicates that the energies of the excitations decrease with U and an energy gap opens at the border of the first Brillouin zone (the X-M line). Such features where also found for the Haldane-Hubbard model, see Fig. 6. Importantly, for the square lattice -flux model, the decay rates of the spin-wave excitations vanish.
The effects of a decreasing of the flatness ratio of the noninteracting bands due to the variation of the nextnearest-neighbor hopping amplitude t2 (see Fig. 3 from Ref. [28] for details) are shown in Fig. 10(b). Apart from a renormalization of the excitation energies, the spin-wave spectrum (51) display the same features of the nearly flat-band limit, similar to the behaviour found for the Haldane-Hubbard model, see Fig. 7.
Finally, the effects of a finite staggered on-site energy M are presented in Fig. 10(c). Since the kinetic contribution ¯q, is quite small it is not considered. In addition to open an energy gap at the first Brillouin zone border, a finite M also decreases the lower branch energies in the

vicinity of the  point, which indicates an instability of the flat-band ferromagnetic phase, see also Fig. 8(a).
As discussed in Sec. V, the instability of the flat-band ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a finite staggered on-site energy M might be an artefact of the bosonization formalism related to the kinetic contribution (38). Although it is not clear yet how to properly include in the effective boson model (44) the explicitly effects of the dispersion of the noninteracting bands, we check weather a modification of the boson operators (28) definition could restore the Goldstone mode. In the following, we briefly summarize such a possible procedure and apply it for the square lattice -flux model.
The definition of the boson operators (28) is based on the linear combination (31) of the projected spin operators S¯q,A/B. Since a finite M introduces an offset in the energies of the sites associated with the sublattices A and B, instead of Eq. (31), one should consider the generalized form



S¯q±,0 =

2 2

cos()S¯q±,A + sin()S¯q±,B

,



S¯q±,1 =

2 2

sin()S¯q±,A - cos()S¯q±,B

,

(C1)

where the linear combination (31) can be obtained by
choosing the parameter  = /4. In this case, the expansion of the F2,q function (32) in terms of the coefficients (12) now reads

g(p, q) = GA(p, q)[cos()(1 - ) +  sin()] + GB(p, q)[sin()(1 - ) -  cos()], (C3)
with the Ga(p, q) function defined by Eq. (A3). Eqs. (C2) and (C3) implies that the expansion (A4) of the Ga(k, q) function in terms of the coefficients (12) is also modified. Importantly, the modified F2,q func-

tion (C2) with  = /4 implies that the condition (46) is

no longer valid for the square lattice -flux model.

Figure 11(a) shows the energy of the Goldstone mode

in terms of  = -/4 determined with both dispersion

relations (51) and (52) for on-site staggered energy M =

coefficients

[Eq.

(42)]

are

neglected.
