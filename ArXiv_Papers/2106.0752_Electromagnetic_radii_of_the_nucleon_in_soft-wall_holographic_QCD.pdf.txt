We revisit the electromagnetic form factors of the proton and neutron in the holographic soft wall model. At low momentum transfer, we show that by matching the nucleon and rho Regge slopes and fixing the nucleon anomalous dimension by the nucleon mass, a perfect match to the world average charge radii from e-p scattering (including the recent small charge radius of the proton measured by the PRad collaboration at JLab) follows. At high momentum transfer, the nucleon anomalous dimension runs up to match the hard scaling rule.

I. INTRODUCTION

The nucleon is a composite hadron with quarks and gluons constituents, the stuff at the origin of all hadronic matter. The quarks are charged and their distribution inside a nucleon is captured by the electric and magnetic charge radii, which measure the charge and current distributions respectively. Precision electron scattering and spectroscopic measurements show a stubborn 4% discrepancy, the so-called proton radius puzzle [1­3]. This is a surprising state of affairs given the fundamental nature of the proton.
The proton structure is the quintessential QCD problem, currently addressed using ab-initio lattice simulations [4]. Empirically, the mass of the proton is known with great accuracy, but its fundamental charge radius is not, as shown in Fig. 1. The high precision e-p measurement of 0.879 fm [2] while consistent with the value of 0.877 fm from hydrogen spectroscopy [3], is larger than the reported value of 0.842 fm from muonic hydrogen spectroscopy[1]. Recent atomic measurements favor smaller radii, while the e-p newest measurements favor larger radii. The exception is the newly released PRad measurement of 0.831 fm at Jefferson Lab [5]
All in all tension seems to exist between e-p scattering measurements of the proton radius and atomic measurements using muonic hydrogen as illustrated in Fig. 1. Although ideas beyond the standard model have been suggested to fix the discrepancy [7, 8], none so far has been empirically conclusive. Dispersive analyses have favored smaller electric and magnetic charge radii [9], although it is in general hard to gauge the theoretical uncertainties given the strong coupling nature of the problem.
The proton structure emerges from a subtle interplay between the sources composing the nucleon and the pri-

doscalar Goldstone bosons. This last observation is further supported by the straight character of the nucleon and rho Regge trajectories and their remarkable parallelism.
We will address the proton and neutron size problem non-perturbatively in the context of holographic QCD, which among other embodies Regge physics, and provides a field theoretical realization for the dual resonance framework [11] postulated decades ago outside the realm of QCD. The approach, originates from a conjecture that observables in strongly coupled and conformal gauge theories in the limit of a large number of colors and strong gauge coupling, can be determined from classical fields interacting through gravity in an anti-de-Sitter space in higher dimensions [12, 13]. The conjecture has been extended since to non-conformal gauge theories [14].
The holographic description of the electromagnetic form factors in the context of the soft wall model was initially addressed in [15] whith rather large electromagnetic radii. Here we show how to overcome this major shortcoming by suggesting that the nucleon anomalous dimension runs with a smaller dimension at low energy that asymptotes its hard scaling value at high energy [16]. The results are much improved electromagnetic radii and form factors at low energy.
The organization of the paper is as follows: in section II we briefly review the derivation of the electromagnetic form factors using the soft wall construction. We propose to use the nucleon mass to fit the nucleon twist factor at low energy, a departure from the standard fit at high energy to reproduce the hard scattering rules. We show that the ensuing electric Sachs form factors are in much better agreement with the e-p world data at small momenta. In section III we extract the electric and magnetic radii of the proton and neutron which are found to be in good agreement with the world averages. In section IV we show that at higher energies the twist factor runs up to reproduce the hard scattering rules in conformity with the resonance dual result. Our conclusions are in V. Details regarding the holographic fields dual to the QCD sources at the boundary are briefly reviewed in the Appendix.

II. ELECTROMAGNETIC FORM FACTORS
The electromagnetic form factors for the nucleon in the context of the soft wall model have been originally addressed in [15], although with a different analysis at low momentum transfer than the one we will present and which will fix the numerical shortcomings they encountered. The form factors can be extracted from the normalized boundary-to-bulk three-point functions with pertinent LSZ reduction

with q2 = (p - p)2 = -Q2 (space-like). Here N (p) refers to the U(2) proton-neutron doublet.
The vector currents JVaµ at the boundary are sourced by the dual bulk vector fields Vµa(Q, z  0). The Dirac and Pauli contributions to the direct part of the electromagnetic current can be extracted from the pertinent bulk Dirac and Pauli parts of the action in the soft wall model. Here and for simplicitly, we will detail the extraction for the Dirac contribution and quote the answer for the Pauli one. With this in mind, the Dirac part of the action in (A.16) yields

The nucleon electromagnetic form factors including the

result for the proton

The additional invariant form factors stem from the Pauli contribution. They are structurally similar to the Dirac one in (II.8), with

The additional coefficients P,N = 2g52 × (3 ± 0)/2 in (II.10-II.11) follow from the extra couplings 0,3 for
the singlet and triplet contributions of the bulk Pauli
contribution [15]. The Pauli parameter of the proton P can be determined by matching the value of F2P (0) with the experimental data which is 1.793. For the neutron,
the Pauli parameter of the neutron N can be determined by matching the value of F2N (0) with the experimental data which is -1.913. For  = m2N /m2+1 and 4~2 = m2, we have P = 0.423 and N = -0.452.

The connected-dotted-blue and the connected-dottedcyan lines (almost undistinguishable) are the most flexible spline and polynomial fits to the Mainz data [19], respectively. Note that the holographic solid-green curve is undistinguishable from the Arrington and Mainz fits.

Note that the canonical dimension for the QCD baryonic sources is  = 9/2 which would suggest a twist  = 4. However, we expect non-vanishing anomalous dimensions to develop at strong coupling. We do not know of any reliable calculational scheme to assess them. We will assume  and thus  as a parameter that runs with the energy scale, with  = 2.465 (see below) at low energy that asymptotes  = 3 at high energy in conformity with the hard scattering rule.

IV. HARD SCATTERING RULE AND THE DUAL RESONANCE MODEL

V(Q, z  1/Q)  1. More specifically, the integrand in (II.8) gives

The hard scaling behavior for the electric form factor [16] is recovered at high energy by allowing  to run up  = 2.465  3. To show this, we note that the contribution C1(Q) to the Dirac form factor in (II.10) evaluates exactly to

a C1(Q) = 2 B( + 1, a) + B(, a + 1) = aB(, a)
(IV.32)
with a = Q2/4~2 and B(x, y) the symmetric Euler betafunction. At high momentum with a 1 and fixed  , (IV.32) asymptotes

( ) C1(Q) = aB(, a)  a-1

(IV.33)

in agreement with the hard scattering rule for  = 3. This scaling law originates from the contribution of the R-spinor (II.9) in the form factor near the UV boundary, as it dwarfs that of the L-spinor (II.9) when inserted in the integral (II.8), with the bulk-to-boundary propagator

Note that the Pauli contributions in (II.12) carry integrands with extra z  1/Q suppression near the UV boundary, and are subleading in 1/Q2. This is expected since the Pauli term is helicity-flipping.
Finally we note that the Dirac form factor (IV.32) can be re-written as the ratio of two Euler beta-functions

C1(Q)

B( B(

with the Regge trajectory t = 1+ t and t = Q2, where  = 1/4~2 is the open string or rho meson Regge slope.

V. CONCLUSIONS
At low momentum transfer, the holographic description of the electric and magnetic form factors of the nucleon in the context of the soft wall model shows much improvement when the nucleon anomalous dimension or twist is set by the nucleon mass spectrum at low momentum transfer, fixing a major shortcoming in [15] . The result is a smaller twist factor or  = 2.345 with a proton electromagnetic radius in remarkable agreement with the current world averaged e-p scattering data.
At high momentum transfer the twist factor runs up   3 to reproduce the hard scattering rules.  is tied to the probing currents with anomalous dimensions at the boundary. Presently, there is no reliable way to assess these anomalous dimensions at strong coupling. At very high momentum transfer, asymptotic freedom sets in. The anomalous dimensions and scaling follow from weak coupling.

Holography recovers the old dual description with all its phenomenological successes. However, it should be stressed that holography provides much more than that. Indeed, the bulk holographic description in higher dimension allows for the assessment of any n-point function on the boundary through their dual Witten diagrams in bulk, in the double limit of large Nc and strong gauge coupling. It also provides for novel physics for dense systems as dual to black holes in bulk.

Appendix A: Soft-wall holographic QCD
A simple way to capture AdS/CFT duality in the non-conformal limit is to model it using a slice of AdS5 with various bulk fields with assigned anomalous dimensions and pertinent boundary values, in the so-called bottom-up approach which we will follow here using the conventions in our recent work in DIS scattering [25, 26]. We consider AdS5 with a soft wall with a background metric gMN = (µ, -1)R2/z2 with the flat metric µ = (1, -1, -1, -1) at the boundary. Confinement will be described by a harmonic background dilaton  = ~2z2.
