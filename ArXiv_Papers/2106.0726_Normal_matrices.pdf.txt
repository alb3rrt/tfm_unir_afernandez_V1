Abstract Let A be a square complex matrix and z a complex number. The distance, with respect to the spectral norm, from A to the set of matrices which have z as an eigenvalue is less than or equal to the distance from z to the spectrum of A. If these two distances are equal for a sufficiently large finite set of numbers z which are not in the spectrum of A, then the matrix A is normal.
1 Distance to the spectrum
Let A  Cn×n and z  C. We let (A) stand for the spectrum or set of eigenvalues of A. The distance from z to (A) is defined by
dist(z, (A)) := min |z - |.
(A)
The singular values of A will be denoted by 1(A) · · · n(A). Let A denote the conjugate transpose of A. We recall that a vector x  Cn×1 is said to be of unit length if x 2 = 1.
The following proposition will be needed to prove the main result of this section. Proposition 1 (Weyl). Let M  Cn×n and let 1(M ), . . . , n(M ) be the eigenvalues of M , which are ordered such that
|1(M )| · · · |n(M )|.
Then, 1(M ) |1(M )|, |n(M )| n(M ).

Proof. Let x  Cn×1 be a unit vector such that M x = 1(M )x. Then,

M x 2 = |1(M )|.

Since we have

1(M )

=

max
yCn×1

My

2,

y 2=1

1(M ) |1(M )|.

Let U = [u1, . . . , un], V = [v1, . . . , vn]  Cn×n be unitary matrices so that
U M V = diag(1(M ), . . . , n(M )).
Let x  Cn×1 be a unit eigenvector of M associated with the eigenvalue n(M ). As {v1, . . . , vn} is an orthonormal basis of Cn×1, there are 1, . . . , n  C such that
x = 1v1 + · · · + nvn

and

|1|2 + · · · + |n|2 = 1.

(1)

Since M x = n(M )x, we deduce that

M (1v1 + · · · + nvn) = 11(M )u1 + · · · + nn(M )un = n(M )x.

Consequently, the square of the norms of these vectors are equal:

|1|212(M ) + · · · + |n|2n2 (M ) = |n(M )|2.

But, due to the fact that the singular values are ordered non-increasingly, we deduce that

(|1|2 + · · · + |n|2)n2 (M ) |1|212(M ) + · · · + |n|2n2 (M ),

and from (1), we obtain

n2 (M ) |n(M )|2.

Hence, n(M ) |n(M )|.



The following result is derived from Proposition 1. Theorem 2. Let A  Cn×n. Then, for each z  C,

n(zIn - A) dist(z, (A)).

(2)

Proof. For each z  C, let the eigenvalues 1(zIn - A), . . ., n(zIn - A) of the matrix zIn - A be arranged non-increasingly according to their moduli:

|1(zIn - A)| · · · |n(zIn - A)|. As a consequence, we infer that

|n(zIn - A)| = min |z - |.

2 A criterion on normality
Let us recall that a matrix A  Cn×n is said to be normal if AA = AA. To the extent of our knowledge, around ninety different characterizations of the normal matrices are known. See References [2] and [5]. We give a different proof of a relatively recent characterization, which appeared as Theorem 2 in [1]. We first show two lemmas.
Lemma 3. Let A  Cn×n,   (A), x  Cn, x = 0, such that Ax = x. Let us assume that
|| = n(A).
Then,
(i) xA = x.
(ii)  is a semisimple eigenvalue of A.

Proof. Let us assume that the multiplicity of n(A) as singular value of A is k; that is
n(A) = · · · = n-k+1(A) < n-k(A).
Consider the singular value decomposition of A:

Avi = i(A)ui,

Aui = i(A)vi,

(3)

where i  {1, . . . , n}. Thus, B1 = {v1, . . . , vn} and B2 = {u1, . . . , un} are two orthonormal bases for Cn×1. Without loss of generality, it may be assumed that x is a unit vector. If x is written with respect to the basis B1, then

n

x = j vj ,

(4)

j=1

with

n
|j|2 = 1.
j=1

On the one hand, Ax = x by hypothesis. On the other hand, from (3) and (4) we obtain

n

Ax = A

j vj

j=1

n
= jj (A)uj .
j=1

Therefore,
n

x = jj(A)uj .

(5)

j=1

3

By computing the square of the norms of both vectors, we see that

n

||2 = |j|2j2(A).

(6)

j=1

Since n-k+1(A) = · · · = n(A) = ||, we will prove that j = 0, for j  {1, . . . , n - k}. Indeed, (6) can be written as

n-k

n

||2 = |j |2j2(A) +

|j |2||2,

j=1

j=n-k+1

and from that

n

n-k

1-

|j |2 ||2 = |j |2j2(A)

j=n-k+1

j=1

n-k
|j |2n2-k(A)
j=1

n

= 1-

|j |2 n2-k(A).

j=n-k+1

If then ||2

n

1-

|j|2 = 0,

j=n-k+1

n2-k(A), which is impossible. Hence,

n

n-k

1-

|j|2 = 0  |j|2 = 0

j=n-k+1

j=1

and, consequently, j = 0, for j  {1, . . . , n - k}. Thus, (4) and (5) can be expressed as

n

x=

j vj,

j=n-k+1

n

x = e-i

j uj,

(7)

j=n-k+1

where ei = /|| = /n(A). Finally, using (7) in the computation of xA, we prove the thesis of the lemma.

xA = ei

n
j uj
j=n-k+1

n

n

A = ei

jn(A)vj = ei

j ||vj

j=n-k+1

j=n-k+1

n

= || ei

j vj = x.

j=n-k+1

We prove (ii) by contradiction. Let us assume, therefore, that there exists x = 0 such that not only is an eigenvector of A associated with , but is also

4

the first element of a Jordan chain associated with . The chain is assumed to be of length greater than 1; that is, there exists a vector y such that

Ax = x,

Ay = y + x.

(8)

Since n(A) = ||, from (i) we have xA = x. By multiplying (8) on the left by x, we obtain
xAy = xy + xx  xy = xy + x 2  x 2 = 0  x = 0;

which is impossible.



Lemma 4. Let A  Cn×n and (A) = {1, . . . , p}, where p

satisfies

Ax = kx,

xA = kx,

n. If x = 0

for some k  {1, . . . , p}, then x is orthogonal to each eigenvector associated with i, where i = k.

Proof. Let y = 0 be an eigenvector associated with i, where i  {1, . . . , p}\{k}; that is,
Ay = iy.

Then,

xAy = ixy.

Since, by hypothesis, xA = kx, we have

kxy = ixy,

which implies xy = 0.
Theorem 5. Let A  Cn×n and (A) = {1, . . . , p}, where p assume that z1, . . . , zp  C\(A) satisfy

 n. Let us

n(zkIn - A) = |zk - k|,

(9)

for k  {1, . . . , p} respectively. Then A is normal.

5

Proof. Let k be any integer of the set {1, . . . , p}. Let us denote by mk the algebraic multiplicity of k and by sk the geometric multiplicity of k; that is,
mk := dim Rk (A), sk := dim Ker(kIn - A);
where Rk (A) is the root subspace of A associated with k. See its definition on page 46 of [4]. Let us assume that the unit vectors qk1, . . . , qk,sk are linearly independent right eigenvectors associated with k. Hence, for each j  {1, . . . , sk}, it is satisfied Aqkj = kqkj, which yields (zkIn - A)qkj = (zk - k)qkj. Since (9) is satisfied, by Lemma 3 (i) for zk - k and qkj, we deduce that qkj(zkIn - A) = (zk - k)qkj. Moreover, from Lemma 3 (ii) it may be concluded that zk - k is a semisimple eigenvalue of zkIn - A and, consequently, k is a semisimple eigenvalue of A. It follows that Ker(kIn - A) = Ker (kIn - A)2 ; which implies

Rk (A) = Ker(kIn - A)

and, consequently, mk = sk. By Lemma 4, each qkj, where j  {1, . . . , sk}, is orthogonal to qh, where   {1, . . . , p}\{k} and h  {1, . . . , s}. Thus, each qkj is orthogonal to any eigenvector associated with an eigenvalue different from k, which gives
Rk (A)  Rj (A)
where j, k  {1, . . . , p} and j = k. Therefore, these relations of orthogonality enable us to write the decomposition of Cn into root subspaces as

Cn = R1 (A)  · · ·  Rp(A),

where  stands for orthogonal direct sum. To conclude the proof, it suffices

to use the method of Gram-Schmidt in order to build an orthonormal basis

of eigenvectors for each root subspace. Hence, we have proved that there

exists an orthonormal basis of Cn of eigenvectors of A. Consequently, by

Theorem 4, p. 275 of [3], A is normal.



Corollary 6. A matrix A  Cn×n is normal if and only if for each complex number z,
n(zIn - A) = dist(z, (A))
holds.
