## Abstract

Integrated-optic components are being increasingly used in astrophysics, mainly where accuracy and precision are paramount. One such emerging technology is nulling interferometry that targets high contrast and high angular resolution. Two of the most critical limitations encountered by nullers are rapid phase fluctuations in the incoming light causing instability in the interference and chromaticity of the directional couplers that prevent a deep broadband interferometric null. We explore the use of a tricoupler designed by ultrafast laser inscription that solves both issues. Simulations of a tricoupler, incorporated into a nuller, result in order of a magnitude improvement in null depth.
