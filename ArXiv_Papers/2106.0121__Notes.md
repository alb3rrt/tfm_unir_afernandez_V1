## Abstract

In this paper, we analyze the many-server limits of the JSQ policy in the \emph{super-Halfin-Whitt} scaling window when load per server $\lambda_N$ scales with the system size $N$ as $\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}N^{\alpha}(1-\lambda_N)=\beta$ for $\alpha\in (1/2, 1)$ and $\beta>0$. We establish that the centered and scaled total queue length process converges to a certain Bessel process with negative drift and the associated centered and scaled steady-state total queue length, indexed by $N$, converges to a $\mathrm{Gamma}(2,\beta)$ distribution. Both the transient and steady-state limit laws are universal in the sense that they do not depend on the value of the scaling parameter $\alpha$, and exhibit fundamentally different qualitative behavior from both the Halfin-Whitt regime ($\alpha = 1/2$) and the Non-degenerate Slowdown (NDS) regime ($\alpha=1$).
