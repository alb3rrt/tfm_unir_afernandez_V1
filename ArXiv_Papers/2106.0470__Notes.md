## Abstract

In Alexandrov's work \cite{al2, al3} it has been shown that the extended partition function $exp(F^{o,ext}+F^c)$ introduced by Buryak in \cite{bu, bu2} is a tau-function of the KP hierarchy. In this work, we compute the affine coordinates of this tau-function on the Sato Grassmannian using the fermionic reformulation of the Virasoro constraints. As applications we derive some formulas for this partition function and the $n$-point functions of its free energy using methods developed by Zhou in \cite{zhou1}.
