Abstract. We extend the notion of a composition series in an abelian category to allow the multiset of composition factors to have arbitrary cardinality. We then provide sufficient axioms for the existence of such composition series and the validity of "Jordan­Hölder­Schreier-like" theorems. We give several examples of objects which satisfy these axioms, including pointwise finite-dimensional persistence modules, Prüfer modules, and presheaves. Finally, we show that if an abelian category with a simple object has both arbitrary coproducts and arbitrary products, then it contains an object which both fails to satisfy our axioms and admits at least two composition series with distinct cardinalities.

1. Introduction
The Jordan­Hölder Theorem (sometimes called the Jordan­Hölder­Schreier Theorem) remains one of the foundational results in the theory of modules. More generally, abelian length categories (in which the Jordan­Hölder Theorem holds for every object) date back to Gabriel [G73] and remain an important object of study to this day. See e.g. [K14, KV18, LL21].
The importance of the Jordan­Hölder Theorem in the study of groups, modules, and abelian categories has also motivated a large volume work devoted to establishing when a "Jordan­Hölderlike theorem" will hold in different contexts. Some recent examples include exact categories [BHT21, E19+] and semimodular lattices [Ro19, P19+]. In both of these examples, the "composition series" in question are assumed to be of finite length, as is the case for the classical Jordan-Hölder Theorem.
In the present paper, we extend the notion of a composition series in an abelian category so that there is no longer any assumption on the cardinality of the chain of subobjects. More precisely, for an object X in an abelian category A, we consider sets  of subobjects of X which are totally ordered with respect to inclusion. We then consider "successive subfactors" only for those subobjects in  which contain an immediate successor or predecessor. When each of these subfactors is simple and  satisfies certain closure conditions with respect to limits and colimits, we call  a composition series. See Section 3 for precise definitions and examples.
The consideration of infinite composition series goes back to at least 1934. Indeed, in the paper [B34], Birkhoff shows that if  and  are composition series (in the above sense) for some

group G and are well-ordered, then their successive subfactors are the same up to permutation and isomorphism. The same paper, however, also shows that there is no hope for a fully general "Jordan­Hölder-like theorem" beyond this. Indeed, for distinct primes p and q, we have that
0 · · · p2Z pZ Z and 0 · · · q2Z qZ Z
are both composition series for Z (as a Z-module) in the sense that their successive subfactors are simple. On the other hand, the successive subfactors of the first series are all cyclic of order p, while those of the second are cyclic of order q.
In this paper, we consider a class of objects in an abelian category which we call (weakly) Jordan­ Hölder­Schreier (Definition 4.0.4). We then establish a "Jordan­Hölder-like theorem" for this class of objects. This class includes objects of finite length, but is in general much larger. For example, both Prüfer modules over arbitrary rings and pointwise finite-dimensional persistence modules over arbitrary fields are (at least weakly) Jordan­Hölder­Schreier. On the other hand, every abelian category with both arbitrary coproducts and arbitrary products contains an object which is not (weakly) Jordan­Hölder­Schreier. See Section 5 for details about these and additional examples.

1.1. Motivation. Our first motivation comes from the study of pointwise finite-dimensional persistence modules. As defined by Botnan and Crawley-Boevey [BC-B20], a pointwise finitedimensional persistence module is a functor from a small category C to the category of finite dimensional vector spaces over an algebraically closed field k. Pointwise finite-dimensional persistence modules are primarly studied in topological data analysis via persistent homology. One key property in this setting is that, in many applications, the simple persistence modules are in bijection with the objects in the category C. This means there is a well-defined concept of support; that is, for any pointwise finite-dimensional persistence module M , there is a set {x  C : M (x) = 0} that we call the support of M . In Section 5.3 we show that if C is acyclic (for example, when C is a poset category), then the composition factors of a pointwise finite-dimensional persistence module M over C are precisely the simple modules S corresponding to the objects in the support of M .
Another source of motivation is Prüfer modules. A module M over an arbitrary ring R is called Prüfer if there exists a locally nilpotent surjective endomorphism  : M  M so that ker() has finite length. It follows that M = nN ker(n) is a filtered colimit of finite length modules, but is not itself of finite length.
In the representation theory of finite-dimensional (associative) algebras, Prüfer modules are closely related to generic modules, and themselves contain information about the category of finitelygenerated modules. See for example [Ri09]. It is therefore natural to try to include the Prüfer modules when studying modules of finite length. As we show in Section 5.2, this is possible using our generalized notion of a composition series. More precisely, we show that any filtered colimit of finite length modules is Jordan­Hölder­Schreier, and therefore has a unique multiset of composition factors under our definition.

1.2. Organization and Main Results. The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we recall background information on subobjects, length categories, and (co)limits in functor categories. In Section 3, we define the notion of a bicomplete subobject chain of an object in an abelian category (Definition 3.1.3) and formalize our notion of a composition series as a special case (Definition 3.2.6). We then prove our first main theorem.
Theorem A (Theorem 3.3.7). Let X be an object of a skelletally small abelian category. Suppose that every totally ordered (under inclusion) set  of subobjects of X has a greatest lower bound lim  and a least upper bound colim  which are subobjects of X. Then there exists a composition series of X. Moreover,
(1) A totally ordered set  of subobjects of X is a composition series if and only if it is not a proper subset of a larger totally ordered set of subobjects of X.

(2) If  is a totally ordered set of subobjects of X, then there exists a composition series  of X with    .
Remark 1.2.1. We note that our notions of bicomplete subobject chains and composition series also come with "one-sided" variants, where we assume only the existence of either greatest lower bounds or least upper bounds of totally ordered sets of subobjects. We maintain, however, that the "two-sided" variant is the correct generalization due to the existence of "one-sided" composition series  and  of the same object which satisfy   . See Proposition 3.3.6 and Example 3.3.8.
Remark 1.2.2. Theorem A only guarantees the existence of a composition series, but does not imply any notion of uniqueness. Indeed, Z (as a Z-module) admits a composition series under our definition. See Example 3.2.8.
We begin Section 4 by establishing an equivalence relation on (bicomplete) subobject chains, which we call subfactor equivalence (Definition 4.0.1). This generalizes the classical equivalence relation making two chains equivalent if they have the same length and successive subfactors (up to isomorphism and permutation). We then introduce (weakly) Jordan­Hölder­Schreier objects in an abelian category (Definition 4.0.4). These can be seen as objects where the least upper bound and greatest lower bound of a totally ordered set of subobjects not only exist, but are well-behaved. (As with subobject chains and composition series, there are again "one-sided" variants of these objects where properties are assumed about either least upper bounds or greatest lower bounds.)
Once establishing the definition and basic properties, Section 4.1 is devoted to proving the main result of this paper.
Theorem B (Theorem 4.1.14). Let X be a weakly Jordan­Hölder­Schreier object in a skelletally small abelian category. Then there exists a composition series for X and any two composition series for X are subfactor equivalent.
In light of this theorem, the (multi)set of composition factors associated to a (weakly) Jordan­ Hölder­Schreier object X, denoted sf(X), is well-defined.
Our proof of Theorem B is similar to that of the classical (and well-ordered) Jordan­Hölder Theorem given by "conflating" two chains of subobjects (see e.g. [L02, Section I.3], [S09+]). In particular, it relies on a generalization of Schreier's classical "refinement theorem" (see Theorems 2.2.2 and 4.1.13).
In Section 4.2, we discuss the relationship between (weakly) Jordan­Hölder­Schreier objects and their duals. Unlike with objects of finite length, there exist (weakly) Jordan­Hölder­Schreier objects which are not (weakly) Jordan­Hölder­Schreier in thier oppositie category (see Example 5.2.3). Nevertheless, categories in which every object satisfies both the definition of (weakly) Jordan­ Hölder­Schreier and its dual offer a natural generalization of length categories. In particular, we prove the following.
Theorem C (Theorem 4.2.7, simplified). Let A be a skelletally small abelian category so that every object is weakly Jordan­Hölder­Schreier in both A and Aop. Let 0  Y -f X -g Z  0 be a short exact sequence in A. Then there is an induced bijection (of multisets) sf(Y ) sf(Z) = sf(X). Moreover, if both Y and Z are Jordan­Hölder­Schreier, then Z = 0 if and only if the induced inclusion sf(Y )  sf(X) is an isomorphism.
Finally, in Section 5, we give examples and non-examples of (weakly) Jordan­Hölder­Schreier objects. Our examples include objects of finite length (Section 5.1) and functor categories with a length category as a target (Section 5.3). The latter in particular includes categories of pointwise definite-dimensional persistence modules. Furthermore, when the source category is directed (for example, when the functors are presheaves over some topological space), we are actually able to describe the composition factors explicitly. See Sections 2.3 and 5.3 for precise definitions and the more general version of our final main theorem, which we state in simplified form below.

Theorem D (Proposition 5.3.1, Theorem 5.3.2, and Corollary 5.3.3, simplified).
(1) Let C be a directed small category and let k be an arbitrary field. Then any pointwise finite-dimensional C-persistence module M : C  vec(k) is Jordan­Hölder­Schreier (in the category of covariant functors from C to that of finite-dimensional k-vector spaces). Moreover, for each object X of C, the simple module with support at X is a composition factor of M with multiplicity dimk M (X).
(2) Let A be a skeletally small abelian category such that every object in A is Jordan­Hölder­ Schreier. Then any presheaf on a topological space X with values in A is Jordan­Hölder­ Schreier (in the category of contravariant functors from the poset of open sets of X to A).
We conclude Section 5 with two additional examples. First, we show that every object of Igusa and Todorov's category of representations of R [IT15] are weakly Jordan­Hölder­Schreier, even though this category contains no simple objects (Section 5.4). Finally, we show that every nonzero abelian category which has both arbitrary coproducts and arbitrary products contains an object which is not weakly Jordan­Hölder­Schreier and, if the category contains a simple object, admits two composition series with different cardinalities (Section 5.5).

2. Background
In this section we fix our notation and recall necessary background information. We note that, in any category, limits commute with limits and colimits commute with colimits, when they exist. Moreover, in an abelian category, finite limits commute with finite colimits. Throughout the present paper, when we say "abelian category" we mean "skeletally small abelian category" unless we explicitly state otherwise. We fix such a category A for the duration of this paper.
2.1. Subobjects in abelian categories. We begin by recalling the definition and basic properties of subobjects in an abelian category. A detailed and well-written teatise for this theory can be found in [M06].
Let X be an object in A. We recall that a subobject of X is a pair (Y, Y ) where Y is also an object in A and Y : Y  X is a monomorphism. The subobjects of X form a category, which we denote Sub(X). Morphisms in this category are given by
HomSub(X)((Y, Y ), (Z, Z )) = {h  HomA(Y, Z)|Y = Z  h}.
Necessarily, we see that if h  HomSub(X)((Y, Y ), (Z, Z )), then h is a monomorphism in A. Moreover, we have that | HomSub(X)((Y, Y ), (Z, Z ))|  1.
From now on, we will identify Sub(X) with a skeleton. This gives Sub(X) the structure of a poset under the relation (Y, Y ) (Z, Z) if Hom((Y, Y ), (Z, Z)) = . If we denote this unique map by fY,Z, then we can view (Y, fY,Z) as an object in Sub(Z). As a result, we will also use the notation
to mean "is a subobject of". In the case that A is a module category, this relation coincides with the usual notion of containment for submodules. Nevertheless, we have chosen to use the notation for this relation to avoid confusion with refinements of (pre-)subobject chains, which are actually subsets (see Definitions 3.1.3 and 3.3.2). We adopt the common notation of omitting the inclusion map from the description of a subobject when this data is implied. We caution that, as in the module case, this means there may be

subobjects Y and Z of X which are isomorphic in A but which are not isomorphic in Sub(X). To distinguish this, we will say that Y = Z when they are isomorphic as subobjects of X.
The poset Sub(X) is known to form a lattice. Given Y, Z  Sub(X), their least upper bound is denoted Y + Z and their greatest lower bound is denoted Y  Z. In module categories, these coincide with the usual notions of sums and intersections. Categorically, we have that Y  Z and Y + Z are the kernel and image of the morphism Y  Z -[-Y--Z] X, respectively. In particular, let jY : Z  Y  Y and JZ : Z  Y  Z be the inclusion maps. Then Y  Z and Y + Z are the pullback and pushout of the respective diagrams

Z -Z X Y- Y

and Z jZ- Z  Y -jY Y.

If A has arbitrary coproducts, we can more generally speak of infinite intersections and sums (and in this case, the lattice Sub(X) is complete); however, we will not in general assume the existence of infinite coproducts.
It should be noted that there is a dual theory for quotient objects in an abelian category A, which can be viewed as the presented theory in Aop. In particular, pushouts become pullbacks and vice-versa. In Section 4.2, we will have need of both theories simultaneously, and so we introduce the relevant notation here. For an object X and two quotient maps qY : X  Y , qZ : X  Z, we denote the pushout by Y X Z. This is also the cokernel object of the map (ker qY + ker qZ)  X. Finally, we note that if Y is a subobject of X, then there is a one-to-one corresondence between subobjects of Z of X with Y Z and subobjects of X/Y which sends Z to Z/Y .

2.2. Composition series and length. Let X be an object in A. Consider
 = {0 = X0 X1 · · · Xn-1 Xn = X}
a finite sequence of subobjects of X. We refer to the objects Xi/Xi-1 for 1  i  n as the (successive) subfactors of . If all of these subfactors are simple, then  is called a composition series. We say  is subfactor equivalent to another finite chain of subobjects
 = {0 = Y0 Y1 · · · Ym-1 Yn = X} if m = n and there exists a permutation  on {1, . . . , n} so that Xi/Xi-1 = Y(i)/Y(i)-1 for each i. This allows us to state the well-known Jordan­Hölder Theorem for abelian categories.
Theorem 2.2.1 (Jordan­Hölder Theorem). Let X be an object in A and let  and  be composition series of X. Then  and  are subfactor equivalent.
Based upon this theorem, if  is a composition series of X, then the length of  is referred to as the length of X and the subfactors of  are referred to as the composition factors of X. The abelian category A is then called a length category if every object has finite length (and thus well-defined length and composition factors).
Closely related to the Jordan­Hölder Theorem is the Schreier Refinement Theorem, which says that one may essentially conflate the data of two finite chains of subobjects.
Theorem 2.2.2 (Schreier Refinement Theorem). Let X be an object in A and let  and  be finite filtrations of X. Then there exist filtrations  and  of X such that:
(1) Each object that appears in  appears in  and each object that appears in  appears in  . (2) The filtrations  and  are (subfactor) equivalent.
Indeed, it is common to prove the Schreier Refinement Theorem first and obtain the Jordan­ Hölder Theorem as a corollary. See e.g. [L02, Section I.3] in the setting of groups. We will adopt a similar strategy in proving our generalization of the Jordan­Hölder Theorem.

2.3. Functor categories. We now discuss categories of functors with target in an abelian category. We again refer to [M06] for more details.
Let C be a small category and recall that A is an abelian category. Then the category Fun(C, A) of covariant functors from C to A is once again abelian. This is sometimes referred to as the category of A-representations of C.
We recall that colimits and limits can be computed "pointwise" in functor categories, in the following sense. Let D = (F, N ) be a diagram in Fun(C, A) (with set of objects F and set of morphisms N ). For X an object of A, define

(1)

C(X) := colim({M (X)|M  F}, {X |  N })

if this colimit exists. If C(X) exists for all objects X, then for each morphism X -f Y in C, there
C(f )
is a natural morphism C(X) --- C(Y ). This makes C into a functor from D to A, and we have C = colim D. The limit of D is computed similarly (when all of the pointwise limits exist).
To conclude this section, we recall known results about the category Fun(R, vec(k)) where k is a field and R is the category with objects the real numbers and precisely one morphism x  y if and only if x  y. The category Fun(R, vec(k)) is often referred to as the category of pointwise finite-dimensional (R)-persistence modules. It serves as the basis for many of our examples, as well as a large part of our motivation.
We now review results about certain indecomposable objects in Fun(R, vec(k)) and the morphisms between them. These results are due to Crawley-Boevey [C-B15]. Much of the theory also extends to the case where R is given a partial order in place of its standard order. See [BC-B20, IRT19+]. In Section 5.4, we will also consider a certain subcategory of Fun(R, vec(k)) which was first studied by Igusa and Todorov [IT15].
For M  Fun(R, vec(k)) and x  y in R, we denote by M (x, y) the result of applying M to the unique morphism x  y.
For every (open, closed, or half-open) interval I  R and for all x, y  R with x  y, denote

(2)

MI (x) =

k 0

xI x / I

MI (x, y) =

1k 0

xyI otherwise.

The functor MI is often referred to as the interval indecomposable representation associated to I. Up to isomorphism, these are precisely the indecomposable objects in Fun(R, vec(k)). Moreover, for two intervals I, J, there is a monomorphism MI  MJ in (R, vec(k)) if and only if (a) I  J, (b) the right endpoint of I is the same as the right endpoint of J, and (c) the intervals are either both open on the right or both closed on the right. Moreover, if these conditions are met then this monomorphism is unique up to scalar multiplication.
Finally, let  be a set of intervals in R which is totally ordered with respect to the relation I J if there is a monomorphism MI  MJ . Then we have

(3)

MI = M( I I)

MI = M( I I).

3. Subobject Chains

3.1. Limits and colimits of (pre-)subobject chains. In this section we define (pre-)subobject chains, cocompletenesss, completeness, and bicompleteness. Then we study limits and colimits in subobject chains. We recall that A refers to a skelletally small abelian category.

Definition 3.1.1. Let X be an object in A and let  be a set of subobjects of X. We say that  is a pre-subobject chain of X if
(C1) The set  is totally ordered under the relation . We say that a pre-subobject chain is a subobject chain if in addition

(C2) The minimum element 0 of Sub(X) is in . (C3) The maximum element X of Sub(X) is in .

Let  be a pre-subobject chain of X. Given Y, Y   with Y Y , we denote by fY,Y : Y  Y the unique morphism in HomSub(X)(Y, Y ). We will also denote by fY,Y the morphism U (fY,Y ), where U : Sub(X)  A is the forgetful functor sending (Y, Y ) to Y .
Now consider a pre-subobject chain  of an object X in C. There are two diagrams we may
associate to :

(1) In the category Sub(X), we can identify  with the diagram Ds with set of objects (Y, Y )   and morphisms fY,Y for (Y, Y ) (Y , Y )  .
(2) In the category A, we can identify  with the diagram D = U (Ds) with set of objects U (Y ), for each Y   and morphisms fY,Y for Y Y  .
Let us first consider the limits of these two diagrams. Suppose there exists an object Z of C with
morphisms gY : Z  U (Y ) for each Y   such that gY = fY,Y  gY whenever Y Y . Then im gY = im gY whenever Y Y . Now let G = im gY for some Y   and let j : G  Y be the induced inclusion. Then each gY factors through G, and (G, Y  j) is in Sub(X). From this it follows that if lim D or lim Ds exists then they both exist and lim D = U (lim Ds).
On the other hand, it may be the case that colim D = U (colim Ds). Indeed, X is a solution to D, so there will be a unique morphism colim D  X, but this morphism may not be a monomorphism.
As an example: for any left linear topological ring R, the category T of strict and complete topologically finitely generated left R-modules is co-Grothendieck [O69, Theorem 5]. Then T op is Grothendieck and we know that for any X in T op,


X = lim · · ·

In particular,

Thus, in T

we have the dual situation.

For clarity, we make explicit that by colim() be mean colim(D) and by lim(), we mean

lim(D) = U (lim Ds). We will say that colim() is a subobject of X if the induced morphism

colim D1  X is a monomorphism. In this case, we have colim(D) = U (colim Ds).

Moreover, if A is Grothendieck, then lim(Ds) = Y  Y and colim Ds = Y  Y . In general, however, the infinite intersection and infinite product may not exist (for example if A does not have

arbitrary coproducts).

Remark 3.1.2. Let X be an object in A and let  be a pre-subobject chain of X. Suppose
L = lim() exists and let L : L  X be the induced inclusion. Then in Sub(X) we have that if (Z, Z) (Y, Y ), for all (Y, Y )  , then (Z, Z) (L, ). That is, (L, L) is the infimum of  in Sub(X). Simiarly, if C = colim() exists and is a subobject of X with induced inclusion C then (C, C) is the supremum of  in Sub(X).

Based on this discussion, we introduce the following definitions.

Definition 3.1.3. Let X be an object of A and let  be a pre-subobject chain of X. We say that  is cocomplete if it satisfies the following:
(C4) If    is an arbitrary subset, then colim  exists and is an element of . In particular, colim  is a subobject of X.
Simiarly, we say that  is complete if it satisfies the following: (C5) If    is an arbitrary subset, then lim  exists and is an element of .
Finally, we say that  is bicomplete if it is both cocomplete and complete.

Remark 3.1.4. We note that, although similar, (C5) is not the dual of (C4). Indeed, the dual of (C4) is a statement about limits of totally ordered sets of quotient objects, not of subobjects.

This is a theme in several of the definitions that will occur throughout this paper. We will discuss how the duality between subobjects and quotients comes into play with these definitions in more detail in Section 4.2.

Example 3.1.5. (1) In any abelian category, any finite subobject chain is bicomplete. (2) Consider Z as a Z-module. For p a prime, define
p = {0Z}  {pZ :   N}
with the natural inclusion maps. Then p is a bicomplete subobject chain of Z. (3) Consider the category Fun(R, vec(k)) for some field k. Now define
1 = {M(a,1) | a  [0, 1)}  {0} 2 = {M[a,1) | a  (0, 1)}  {0, M(0,1)} 3 = 1  2.
(See Equation 2 for an explanation of the notation M(a,1) etc.) We note that as posets, 1 and 2 are isomorphic to [0, 1] and 3 is isomorphic to the lexicographical order on [0, 1] × {0, 1} without the elements (0, 0) and (1, 1).
Now for i  {1, 2, 3} and   i, let

C=

I,

MI 

L=

I

MI 

and note that colim  = MC and lim  = ML (see Equation 3). Since the intervals defining 1 are closed under unions but not intersections, this means 1 is a cocomplete subobject chain of M(0,1) which is not complete. Likewise, 2 is a complete subobject chain of M(0,1) which is not cocomplete, and 3 is a bicomplete subobject chain of M(0,1).

3.2. Subfactor multisets and composition series. In this section, we generalize the definition of a composition series to include subobject chains of arbitrary cardinality. As a starting point, this requires us to precisely describe the subfactors of such a subobject chain. To that end, we fix the following notation.

Notation 3.2.1. Let X be an object of A and let  be a pre-subobject chain of X. For Y  , we denote by
Y- := colim{Z   | Z Y } Y+ := lim{Z   | Y Z}
when these diagrams are not empty and their colimits and limits exist. Likewise, if 0  , we define 0- := 0 and if X  , we define X+ := X. When the pre-subobject chain  is clear, we will sometimes write Y - for Y- and Y + for Y+.
One can consider Y- and Y+ as the "predecessor" and "successor" of Y in , respectively. For example, suppose  is bicomplete (and so Y- and Y+ both exist for every Y  ). If  is well-ordered with respect to , then Y+ will truly be the successor of Y in . (This is the approach used to prove "Jordan­Hölder-like" and "Schreier-like" theorems for well-ordered subobject chains in [S09+].) The case where Y+ = Y similarly corresponds to when Y has no successor. Example 3.2.3(3) shows an example of this.
The following definition extends this generalization of predecessors and successors to a generalization of what is meant by the successive subfactors of a subobject. We recall that a multiset is allowed to contain multiple distinct copies of the same element.

Definition 3.2.2.
(1) Let X be an object of a A and let  be a cocomplete subobject chain of X. Then the lower subfactor multiset of  is
sf-() := {Y /Y- | Y  , Y = Y -}.
(2) Let X be an object of A and let  be a complete subobject chain of X. Then the upper subfactor multiset of  is
sf+() := {Y+/Y | Y  , Y = Y +}.
Example 3.2.3.
(1) Let X have finite length and let  be a compositition series of X. Then  is subobject bicomplete and sf-() = sf+() is the multiset of composition factors of X (with multiplicity).
(2) For p a prime, let p be as in Example 3.1.5(2). Then sf+(p) = sf-(p) consists of countably many copies of Z/pZ.
(3) Let 1, 2, and 3 be as in Example 3.1.5(3). Now for a  (0, 1), we have (M(a,1))-1 = colim{M(b,1) | b  (a, 1)} = M(a,1) (M(a,1))-3 = colim{M(b,1), M[b,1) | b  (a, 1)} = M(a,1) (M[a,1))-3 = colim({M(b,1), M[b,1) | b  (a, 1)}  {M(a,1)}) = M(a,1)
This shows that sf-1 = . and sf-3 = {M[a,a] | a  (0, 1)}. A similar argument shows that sf+2 =  and sf+3 = sf-3.
We note that for those subobject chains in Example 3.2.3 which are bicomplete, the upper and lower subfactor multisets coincide. The following shows that this is completely general.
Proposition 3.2.4. Let X be an object of A and let  be a bicomplete subobject chain of X. (1) If Y   and Y = Y -, then (Y -)+ = Y . (2) If Y   and Y = Y +, then (Y +)- = Y . (3) There is an equality of multisets sf-() = sf+().
Proof. (1) Let  = {Y   | Y - Y }. By assumption, we have that Y  . Moreover, if Y   with Y Y , then Y Y - by definition. We conclude that Y = lim  = (Y -)+. The proof of (2) is similar.
(3) Let F -() = {(Y , Y )   ×  | Y = Y - = Y }.
Then there is a natural bijection F -()  sf-() given by (Y , Y )  Y /Y . Likewise, define
F +() = {(Y, Y )   ×  | Y = Y + = Y },
so that there is a natural bijection F +()  sf+() given by (Y, Y )  Y /Y . Now given (Y , Y ) = (Y -, Y )  F -(), we have by (1) that (Y )+ = Y = Y . This means
(Y , Y )  F +(). Likewise, given (Y, Y ) = (Y, Y +)  F +(), we have by (2) that (Y )- = Y = Y . This means (Y, Y )  F -(). We conclude that F +() = F -() and thus sf-() = sf+().
Notation 3.2.5. From now on, when the hypotheses of Proposition 3.2.4 are satisfied, we will write sf() instead of sf-() or sf+().
We are now ready to define generalized notions of composition series and filtrations over a subcategory.
Definition 3.2.6. Let D be a subcategory of A which is closed under isomorphisms. Let X be an object of A and let  be a subobject chain of X.

(1) We say that  is a lower D-filtration if  is subobject cocomplete and every object in sf-() is in D. If an addition every object in D is simple in A, we say that  is a lower compositition series.
(2) We say that  is an upper D-filtration if  is subobject complete and every object in sf+() is in D. If an addition every object in D is simple in A, we say that  is an upper compositition series.
(3) We say that  is a D-filtration (respectively a composition series) if  is subobject bicomplete and is a lower D-filtration (respectively a lower composition series).
Remark 3.2.7. As an immediate consequence of Proposition 3.2.4, we see that a bicomplete subobject chain  is a D-filtration (respectively a composition series) if and only if it is an upper D-filtration (respectively an upper composition series). That is, we could replace both instances of "lower" with "upper" in Definition 3.2.6(3) without actually changing the definitions.
Example 3.2.8. All of the subobject chains in Example 3.2.3 are (lower or upper) composition series. In particular, (finite) composition series in the traditional sense are also composition series under Definition 3.2.6.
3.3. The existence of composition series. We now turn towards determining when an object X of A admits a composition series. In order to do so, we establish the following definitions.
Definition 3.3.1. Let X be an object of A. We say that X is subobject cocomplete if (JHS1) For  a pre-subobject chain of X, the colimit colim  exists and is a subobject of X. Similarly, we say that X is subobject complete if (JHS2) For  a pre-subobject chain of X, the limit lim  exists. We say that X is subobject bicomplete if it is both subobject cocomplete and subobject complete.
Definition 3.3.2. Let  and  be subobject chains of X. We say that  is a refinement of  if    and that  is a proper refinement of  if   .
We now show that when an object X is subobject bicomplete (resp. cocomplete, complete), there is a natural way to refine an arbitrary subobject chain of X into a bicomplete (resp. cocomplete, complete) subobject chain. We first prove the following lemma.
Lemma 3.3.3. Let X be an object of A and let Y X be a subobject. If X is subobject bicomplete (respectively cocomplete, complete), then Y is bicomplete (respectively cocomplete, complete).
Proof. Let  be a pre-subobject chain of Y and note that  is also a pre-subobject chain of X. Now, if lim  exists, then it is a subobject of Y automatically. Moreover, if colim  exists and is a subobject of X, then the composition of the inclusion Y X and the natural map colim   Y must be the inclusion colim  X. We conclude that colim  is a subobject of Y . This proves the result.
Proposition 3.3.4. Let X be a subobject bicomplete object in A, and let  be a subobject chain of X. Then there exists a canonical bicomplete subobject chain  which is a refinement of  and so that if a refinement  of  is bicomplete, then  is a refinement of . Moreover, the statement is true if one replaces each "bicomplete" either with "cocomplete" or with "complete."
Proof. We prove the result when A is bicomplete, as the other two cases follow from similar constructions and arguments. Define
 := {colim , lim  |   } .
We note that  is a set of subobjects of X by the axioms (JHS1) and (JHS2). Moreover, we see that    because for any Y   we have Y = colim{Y } = lim{Y }. In particular,  satisfies (C2) and (C3).

We now show that  satisfies (C1). By the previous paragraph, we know that every subobject in  is either the colimit or the limit of a pre-subobject chain   . Thus let ,    be two such chains.
We first show that colim  and colim  are comparable. Indeed, if there exists Y   such that Y Y for all Y   , then we can see  as a pre-subobject chain of Y . It then follows from Lemma 3.3.3 and the axiom (JHS1) that colim  Y colim . Otherwise, by symmetry, we may assume that for all Y  , there exists Y   with Y Y and vice versa. In this case, it is straightforward to see that colim  = colim  .
The argument that lim  and lim  are comparable is completely analogous using the axiom (JHS2). Therefore, consider colim  and lim  . Now if there exist Y   and Y   with Y Y , then lim( ) colim() and we are done. Otherwise, for all Y   and Y  , we have Y Y . Lemma 3.3.3 and the axiom (JHS2) then imply that colim  Y for all Y   . In particular, we have that colim  is a solution to the diagram  , and so there exists a morphism colim   lim  in A. Finally, this morphism must be mono since the composition with the inclusion lim  Y is mono for any Y   . We conclude that  satisfies (C1).
We have shown that  is a subobject chain of X. It remains to show that  is bicomplete; i.e., that  satisfies (C4) and (C5).
Let   . By (JHS1) and (JHS2), we know that colim  and lim  exist and are subobjects of X. Now denote
 := {Y   | lim  Y colim }.
First suppose that  = . By the previous paragraphs, this means that if there exist pre-subobject chains 1, 2   with colim 1, colim 2  , then colim 1 = colim 2. Likewise, if there exist pre-subobject chains 1, 2   with lim 1, lim 2  , then lim 1 = lim 2. We conclude that ||  2, and therefore colim , lim     .
If  = , let  = {Y   | Y lim }. By analogous reasoning to before, we see that | |  2. If  = , then we have lim  = lim   . Otherwise, we have that lim     . The argument that colim    is analogous
We will refer to  as in Proposition 3.3.4 as the bicompletion (respectively cocompletion, completion) of . To avoid possible ambiguity, we will be explicit about for which of these three any use of the notation  refers.
Example 3.3.5. In Examples 3.1.5(3) and 3.2.3(3), we have that 3 is the bicompletion of both 1 and 2.
We conclude this section by proving the existence of (lower and upper) composition series and relating composition series to the existence of proper refinements. We first consider the subobject cocomplete and complete cases. We then consider the subobject bicomplete case and prove our first main result (Theorem A in the introduction).
Proposition 3.3.6. Let X be an object of A and suppose X is subobject cocomplete. Then there exists a lower composition series of X. Moreover, for a pre-subobject chain  of X, we have:
(1) If  admits no proper refinements, then it is a lower composition series. (2) There exists a lower composition series  of X which is a refinement of .
Likewise, the result holds if one replaces "cocomplete" with "complete" and "lower composition series" with "upper composition series."
Proof. We prove only the cocomplete case, as the other case is similar. We also note that the existence of a lower composition series follows immediately from (2) since {0, X} is a (pre-)subobject chain of X.
(1) By Proposition 3.3.4, we have that  =  is subobject cocomplete. Now let Y   with Y = Y- and let Z be a subobject of X which satisfies Y- Z Y . Then   {Z} is a subobject

12

chain which is a refinement of , and so Z  . It follows that either Z = Y- or Z = Y . Therefore, Y /Y- must be simple.
(2) We prove the result using Zorn's Lemma. Let F(X) be the set of subobject chains of X which
refine . Note that F (X) is nonempty since   F (X). Moreover, if {b}bB is a totally ordered subset of F (X) (with respect to ), then bB b is a subobject chain of X. We conclude that F(X) contains a maximal element by Zorn's Lemma. This element is a lower composition series
by (1).

Theorem 3.3.7 (Theorem A). Let A be a skelletally small abelian category and let X be a subobject bicomplete object of A. Then there exists a composition series of X. Moreover, for a pre-subobject chain  of X we have:
(1)  is a composition series if and only if it admits no proper refinements. (2) There exists a composition series  of X which is a refinement of .

Proof. As with Proposition 3.3.6, we note that the existence of a composition series of X follows
immediately from (2) since {0, X} is a (pre-)subobject chain of X.
(1) Let  be a composition series of X and let  be a subobject chain of X with   . Let
Z  . We will show that Z   and so  = . Define - = {Y   | Y Z} and + = {Y   | Z Y }. Denote Y0 = colim - and Y1 =
lim +, which exist and are subobjects of X by (JHS1) and (JHS2). Since composition series are subobject bicomplete, we then have that Y0, Y1   and that (Y1)- = Y0. This means the quotient Y1/Y0 is either 0 or simple. In either case, this implies that either Z = Y0 or Z = Y1, and so Z  . The reverse implication follows from an argument analogous to the proof of Proposititon 3.3.6(1).
(2) This follows from an argument analogous to the proof of Proposition 3.3.6(2).

Example 3.3.8. We note that, unlike for subobject bicomplete chains, the converse of Proposition 3.3.6(1) does not hold. Indeed, the subobject chains 1 and 2 in Example 3.1.5(3) are lower and upper composition series, respectively, but both admit 1  2 as a proper refinement.

4. (Weakly) Jordan­Hölder­Schreier objects
In this section, we address the uniqueness of composition series. More precisely, for any object X in the (skelletally small) abelian category A, we wish to know when all of the composition series of X are equivalent in the following sense.
Definition 4.0.1. Let X be an object of A and let  and  be cocomplete subobject chains of X. We say that  and  are subfactor equivalent if there exists a bijection
 : {Y   | Y = Y-}  {Z   | Z = Z-} so that Y /Y- = (Y )/(Y )- for all Y . We define subfactor equivalence for complete and bicomplete subobject chains analogously.
Remark 4.0.2. It is an immediate consequence of Proposition 3.2.4 that two bicomplete subobject chains are subfactor equivalent as cocomplete subobject chains if and only if they are subfactor equivalent as complete subobject chains.
Remark 4.0.3. We emphasize that the domain of the bijection  in Definition 4.0.1 is generally not all of , but rather in the cocomplete case consists of only those elements of  which have a "predecessor" and in the complete case consists of only those elements of  which have a "successor". When  and  are well-ordered and complete (or in particular finite), every element has a "successor". Therefore, subfactor equivalence implies that  and  have the same cardinality in this case. Based solely on the definition, however, it is not clear in general whether subobject chains with different cardinalities can be subfactor equivalent.

We now give the set of axioms under which we will prove our "Jordan­Hölder-like" and "Schreierlike theorems". Given a pre-subobject chain  of X and a subobject Z X, we denote   Z = {Y  Z | Y  } and  + Z = {Y + Z | Y  }.

Definition 4.0.4. Let X be an object of A. We say that X is weakly Jordan­Hölder­Schreier (or weakly JHS ) if the following hold.

(JHS3) X satisfies (JHS1) and, for all pre-subobject chains  of X and all subobjects Z have colim(  Z) = (colim )  Z.
(JHS4) X satisfies (JHS2) and, for all pre-subobject chains  of X and all subobjects Z have lim( + Z) = (lim ) + Z.

X, we X, we

We say that X is Jordan­Hölder­Schreier (or JHS ) if in addition

(JHS5) If X = 0 and  is a composition series of X, then sf() = .

Remark 4.0.5.
(1) We note that there do exist weakly JHS objects which are not JHS. Indeed, in Section 5.4, we study an abelian subcategory of Fun(R, vec(k)) which was first considered by Igusa and Todorov [IT15]. Every object in this category is weakly JHS, but only the zero object is JHS. See Proposition 5.4.4.
(2) We stress that being (weakly) JHS makes some reference to the ambient category. For example, suppose X is an object in A and that every endomorphism of X is an automorphism. Then the full subcategory of A consisting of only the objects 0 and X is abelian, and X is JHS in this subcategory. Likewise, it is possible that an object X is JHS in A but not in some subcategory of A. Again, see Proposition 5.4.4.
(3) We recall that if A has arbitrary coproducts, then Grothendieck's axiom (AB5) is equivalent to requiring that (colim   Z) = (colim )  Z for all objects Z and directed systems . In particular, every (AB5) category satisfies (JHS3). We give an alternative explanation of this fact in Remark 4.2.4.
(4) In some sense, the axiom (JHS4) can be seen as generalizing the artinian property. Indeed, if X is a (left) artinian module over any ring, then any pre-subobject chain  of X must contain a minimal object Y . We then have lim( + Z) = Y + Z = (lim ) + Z.

The following can be deduced immediately from the definition, and will be used throughout the remainder of this paper.

Proposition 4.0.6. Let X be a weakly JHS object in A. Then any subobject Y X is also weakly JHS in A.

Remark 4.0.7. We note that if X is JHS then it is possible a subobject Y X is not JHS. For
example, let Y be weakly JHS in an abelian category B and let Z be JHS in an abelian category
C. Then X = Y  Z is JHS in B × C and Y (Y  Z). Alternatively, suppose X is JHS and a composition series  of an object X has exactly one subfactor Y /Y- and that Y- = 0. Then Y- is weakly JHS but not JHS.

Before we continue, we prove the following technical lemma, which will be useful in what follows.

Lemma 4.0.8. Let X be an object of A and suppose that for every pre-subobject chain  of X the colimit colim  exists (in A). Then the following are equivalent.
(1) X is subobject cocomplete; i.e, X satisfies (JHS1). (2) If {f : Y  Z} is a directed system in Sub(X), then colim{f} (considered in A) is a
monomorphism. (3) If {0  Y -f Z -g W  0} is a directed system of short exact sequences with
{f : Y  Z} a directed system in Sub(X), then colim{W} exists and there is a short

14

exact sequence
0  colim{Y} -c-o-lim-{-f-} colim{Z} -c-o-lim-{-g-} colim{W}  0.
Proof. (1 = 2): Let {f : Y  Z} be a directed system in Sub(X). Note that in particular, each morphism f is mono. Now by (1), we have that Y := colim{Y} exists and is a subobject of X, and likewise for Z := colim Z. In particular, the composition of colim{f} : Y  Z with the inclusion Z X must be the inclusion Y X. This means that colim{f} is a monomorphism.
(2 = 3): By (2), we have that colim{f} : colim{Y}  colim{Z} is a monomorphism. We then have that
coker(colim{f}) = colim{coker(f)} = colim{g}. This means that colim{W} exists and the desired sequence is exact, as claimed.
(3 = 1): Let  be a presubobject chain of X. Then by (3), we have that
0  colim   X  X/ colim   0
is an exact sequence, and so colim  is a subobject of X.

4.1. Conflations and Jordan­Hölder­Schreier-like Theorems. In this section, we formalize the notion of conflating two subobject chains and prove our "Jordan­Hölder­like theorem" (Theorem B in the introduction). The argument is similar to the proof of the classical Jordan­Hölder Theorem given in [L02, Section I.3] and of the well-ordered case in [S09+].
Part of the basis for this argument is the "Butterfly Lemma" of Zassenhaus. For convenience, we give a proof of this result here in our notation.

Lemma 4.1.1 (Zassenhaus Butterfly Lemma). Let X be an object in A and let Y, Y -, Z, Z- be subobjects of X with Y - Y and Z- Z. Then

Y - + (Y  Z) Y - + (Y  Z-)

=

Z- + (Z  Y ) Z- + (Z  Y -) .

Proof. Note that Moreover, we have

Y - + (Y  Z) = (Y - + (Y  Z-)) + (Y  Z). (Y  Z)  (Y - + (Y  Z-)) = (Y -  Z) + (Y  Z-).

Therefore by the isomorphism theorems, we have

Y - + (Y  Z) Y - + (Y  Z-)

=

(Y -

Y Z  Z) + (Y

 Z-).

Since the resulting expression is symmetric in Y and Z, this proves the result.

Remark 4.1.2. If Y = Y - or Z = Z-, then both sides of Equation 4.1.1 are zero.

We now define a procedure to conflate the data of two subobject chains.

Definition 4.1.3. Let X be an object in A, and let  and  be subobject chains of X. We the define the lower conflation of  by  to be
con-(, ) :=   {Y- + (Y  Z) | (Y, Z)   × , Y- exists}. Dually, we define the upper conflation of  by  to be
con+(, ) :=   {Y + (Y+  Z) | (Y, Z)   × , Y+ exists}.

Example 4.1.4.
(1) Let Z24 = {0, 1, . . . , 23} be the cyclic group of order 24 (considered in the category of Zmodules). For each i  Z24, we denote by i the subgroup generated by i. Now consider the (bicomplete) subobject chains
 = { 0 , 4 , 1 } and  = { 0 , 6 , 1 }
of Z24. We then have con-(, ) = con+(, ) = { 0 , 12 , 4 , 2 , 1 } con-(, ) = con+(, ) = { 0 , 12 , 6 , 2 , 1 }.
In particular, we note that con-(-, -) and con+(-, -) are not symmetric in their arguments. (2) Consider the subobject chains 1 and 2 in Example 3.1.5(3). Then con-(1, 2) = 1 =
con+(1, 2), but for different reasons. We have con-(1, 2) = 1 because Y-1 = Y for all Y  1. On the other hand, we have con+(1, 2) = 1 because for Y  1, Y+1 is only an element of 1 if Y = 0, in which case Y+1 = Y . (3) Let p and q be distinct primes and let p and q be as in Example 3.1.5(2). Note that for   N, we have (pZ)-p = p+1Z. Moreover, for ,   N, we have
p+1Z + (pZ  qZ) = pZ.
We then have that con-(p, q) = p. We can also see this as a consequence of Proposition 3.3.7(1) and the fact that p is a composition series. See Remark 4.1.7 below.
Remark 4.1.5. Note that if  is cocomplete, then for Y   we can write Y = Y- + Y  X, where X   since  is a subobject chain. In particular, the "" in the definition of con-(, ) becomes redundant in this case. The behavior is similar in the complete case. Nevertheless, it it necessary to include this in the definition in order for Proposition 4.1.6 below to hold. Indeed, in Example 4.1.4(2), removing "" from the definition of con+(1, 2) would result in con+(1, 2) = {0}, which is not a refinement of 1.
We now prove a series of results about the conflation of two subobject chains. From these, we will deduce our "Schreier-like" and "Jordan­Hölder-like" theorems (Theorems 4.1.13 and 4.1.14, respectively).
Proposition 4.1.6. Let X be an object in A, and let  and  be subobject chains of X. Then con-(, ) and con+(, ) are subobject chains of X which are refinements of .
Proof. We prove the result only for con-(, ). The proof for con+(, ) is similar. Since   con-(, ), both (C2) and (C3) are satisfied. Let W, W  con-(, ). We will show
that either W W or W W , and therefore (C1) holds. If both W and W are elements of , then we are done. If W / , write W = Y- + (Y  Z)
with Y   and Z  . Now, there exists Y   so that either W = Y or (Y )- exists and (Y )- W Y . We see that if Y Y (respectively Y Y ) then W W (respectively W W ). Since  is a subobject chain, the only other possibility is that Y = Y . Since Y has a predecessor, this means there exists Z   so that W = Y- + (Y  Z ). Then since  is a subobject chain, we have without loss of generality that Z Z and thus W W .
Remark 4.1.7. If  is a composition series, then Propositions 3.3.7 and 4.1.6 immediately imply that con-(, ) =  = con+(, ) for any .
Lemma 4.1.8. Let X be an object in A, and let  and  be subobject chains of X. (1) If X satisfies (JHS3) and both  and  are cocomplete, then con-(, ) is cocomplete. (2) If X satisfies (JHS4) and both  and  are complete, then con+(, ) is complete.

16

(3) If X is weakly JHS and both  and  are bicomplete, then con-(, ) = con+(, ) and this subobject chain is bicomplete.
Proof. (1) Let   con-(, ) and let  = {Y   | Z   : Y- + (Y  Z)  }. Denote Y0 = colim . Note that since  is cocomplete, we have Y0  .
If Y0 / , then for all Y Y0 in , there exists Y   and Z   so that W := (Y )- + (Y  Z )   and Y W Y0. We conclude that colim  = Y0    con-(, ).
Otherwise, let  = {Z   | (Y0)- + (Y0  Z)  }. By (JHS3) and Lemma 4.0.8, we then have
colim  = colim{(Y0)- + (Y0  Z) | Z  } = (Y0)- + (Y0  colim ).
Now since  is cocomplete, we have colim    and therefore colim   con-(, ). (2)Let   con+(, ) and let  = {Y   | Z   : Y +(Y + Z)  }. Denote Y0 = lim .
Note that since  is complete, we have Y0  . If Y0 / , then for all Y0 Y in , there exists Y   and Z   so that W := Y + ((Y )+ 
Z )   and Y0 W Y . We conclude that lim  = Y0    con+(, ). Otherwise, let  = {Z   | Y0 + ((Y0)+  Z)  }. Since intersections are limits, we then have
by (JHS4) that
lim  = lim{Y0 + ((Y0)+  Z) | Z  } = Y0 + ((Y0)+  lim ).
Now since  is complete, we have that lim    and therefore lim   con+(, ). (3) Let Y   and Z  . If Y- = Y , then
Y- + (Y  Z) = Y = Y + Y+  0.
Otherwise, we have Y- + (Y  Z) = Y- + ((Y-)+  Z)
by Proposition 3.2.4. Therefore in either case, we have that Y- + (Y  Z)  con+(, ). By symmetry, we conclude that con-(, ) = con+(, ). This subobject chain is then bicomplete as a consequence of (1) and (2).

Example 4.1.9. We now present an example of a conflation between a bicomplete chain and a cocomplete chain which does not result in a bicomplete chain. Consider the category Fun(R, vec(k)) and define the subobject chains  and :

=

0,

M[1,1]

,

M[

1 2

,1],

M[0,1]

 = 0, M[1,1], M[0,1]  M(a,1] | a  R, 0 < a < 1 .

Note that  is bicomplete and  is cocomplete. Thus it makes sense to take con-(, ), which is cocomplete by Lemma 4.1.8. We see con-(, ) is given by

con-(, ) =

0,

M[1,1]

,

M[

1 2

,1],

M[0,1]



M(a,1] | a  R, 0 < a < 1

=   .

We see    is still missing uncountably many limits and so it is not complete. Thus, con-(, )

is not bicomplete.

Lemma 4.1.10. Let X be an object in A which is subobject bicomplete. Let  be a cocomplete subobject chain of X and let  be a complete subobject chain of X.
(1) Suppose X satisfies (JHS4), let W  con-(, ), and denote
(W ) = {(Y, Z)   ×  | Y- + (Y  Z) = W }. Then (W ) contains a minimal element with respect to lexicographical ordering of  × .

(2) Suppose X satisfies (JHS3), let W  con+(, ), and denote (W ) = {(Z, Y )   ×  | Z + (Z+  Y ) = W }.
Then (W ) contains a maximal element with respect to the lexicographical ordering of ×.

Proof. We prove only (1) since the proof of (2) is similar. Let  = {Y   | Z   : (Y, Z)  (W )}. We first claim that ||  2. Indeed, suppose Y Y and there exist Z, Z   such that (Y, Z) and (Y , Z ) are in (W ). Note that Y-, (Y )-   since  is cocomplete. Then
(Y )- (Y )- + (Y  Z ) Y Y- Y- + (Y  Z)
implies that Y = Y-, and so  = {Y, Y }. Now let Y0 = lim  and note that Y0   since this set contains at most two elements. Define  = {Z   | (Y0, Z)  }. Since  is complete, we note that Z0 := lim   . Then by (JHS4), we have
(Y0)- + (Y0  Z0) = (Y0)- + (Y0  lim ) = lim((Y0)- + Y0  ) = lim{W }
= W.
We conclude that (Y0, Z0)  (W ). Moreover, if Y   and Z   with either (a) Y Y0, or (b) Y = Y0 and Z Z0, then (Y, Z) / (W ). This means that (Y0, Z0) = min (W ) in the lexicographic ordering.

Example 4.1.11. We note that as a Z-module, Z is subobject bicomplete and satisfies (JHS3). To see that Z does not satisfy (JHS4), let p and q be primes and let p and q be as in Example 3.1.5. Let p = p \ {0Z}. Then for any   N with  = 0, we have

lim(p + qZ)

=

lim (pZ + qZ) = Z


lim(p) + qZ =

lim pZ + qZ = qZ.


Now let  = 0. Working in con-(p, q), we then have by Example 4.1.4(3) that

(pZ) = {(pZ, qZ) |  = 0}  {(p+1Z, 0Z)}.

We note that (pZ) has (p+1Z, 0Z) as its minimal element, but has no maximal element.

Lemma 4.1.12. Let X be a weakly JHS object in A, let  be a cocomplete subobject chain of X,
and let  be a complete subobject chain of X.
(1) Let W  con-(, ) and write W = Y- + (Y  Z) with (Y, Z)   ×  minimal in the sense of Lemma 4.1.10(1). Then

Wc-on-(,) =

W Y- + (Y  Z-)

Y- = Y Y- = Y.

(2) Let W  con+(, ) and write W = Z + (Z+  Y ) with (Z, Y )   ×  maximal in the sense of Lemma 4.1.10(2). Then

Wc+on+(,) =

W Z + (Z+  Y+)

Z+ = Z Z+ = Z.

Proof. We prove only (1) as the proof of (2) is similar. We first observe that since X satisfies (JHS4)
and  is complete, it is indeed possible to write W = Y- + (Y  Z) with (Y, Z)   ×  minimal in the sense of Lemma 4.1.10(1).

Now if Y- = Y , then we must have Z = 0. Then for any W W , we have W Y and so Wc-on-(,) Y . Moreover, if Y Y , then because  is cocomplete we have Y = (Y )-+(Y X)  con-(, ). In particular, since Y Y-, this means that Y Wc-on-(,). We conclude that Wc-on-(,) = Y .
Otherwise, we have Y - W Y . In particular, Z = 0. By (JHS3) and Lemma 4.0.8, this means
Wc-on-(,) = colim{Y- + (Y  Z ) | Z  , Z Z}
= Y- + (Y  colim{Z   | Z Z}) = Y- + (Y  Z-).

We are now ready to prove our "Schreier-like" theorem.

Theorem 4.1.13. Let X be a weakly JHS object of A and let  and  be subobject chains of X. Then there exist bicomplete subobject chains    and    which are subfactor equivalent.

Proof. Let  and  be the bicompletions of  and , respectively. We will show that con-(, )

and con-(, ) are subfactor equivalent. We note that these are bicomplete subobject chains which

refine  and , respectively, by Proposition 3.3.4 and Lemma 4.1.8.

Let W  con-(, ). Since X satisfies (JHS4), we can write W = Y- +(Y Z) with (Y, Z)  ×



minimal

in the sense of

Lemma

4.1.10(1).

Now if Y -


=

Y,

then

Wc-on-(,)

=

W

by Lemma 4.1.12.

In particular, this means W/Wc-on-(,) / sf(con(, ). Otherwise, again by Lemma 4.1.12, we have

that

W/Wc-on-(,)

=

Y- + (Y Y- + (Y

 Z)  Z-)

.

Now denote V := Z- + (Z  Y ) and V := Z- + (Z  Y-). Then by Lemma 4.1.1, we have that W/Wc-on-(,)  sf(con-(, )) if and only if V = V . It follows that if W/Wc-on-(,) is a subfactor, then (Z, Y ) is the minimal representative of V in con-(, ) and that V = Vc-on-(,). In particular, we have V /V  sf(con-(, )).

By symmetry, there is a bijection

 : W  con-(, ) | W = Wc-on-(,)  V  con-(, ) | V = Vc-on-(,)
so that W/Wc-on-(,) = (W )/(W )-con-(,) given by sending the minimal representative W = Y- +(Y Z) to Z- +(Y Z). We conclude that con-(, ) and con-(, ) are subfactor equivalent as claimed.

From this, we deduce our "Jordan­Hölder-like theorem".

Theorem 4.1.14 (Theorem B). Let A be a skelletally small abelian category and let X be a weakly Jordan­Hölder­Schreier object in A. Then there exists a composition series for X and any two composition series for X are subfactor equivalent.

Proof. The existence of a composition series is shown in Theorem 3.3.7. Moreover, if  and  are two pre-subobject chains of X, then there exist    and    which are subfactor equivalent by Theorem 4.1.13. However, by Theorem 3.3.7(1), it must be that  =  and  =  . This proves the result.

Remark 4.1.15. Recall from Example 3.3.8 that an upper or lower composition series may admit a proper refinement. Thus, our proof of Theorem 4.1.14 cannot be readily modified to prove a "Jordan­Hölder-like theorem" for upper or lower composition series. Moreover, we have indeed made use of both the axioms (JHS3) and (JHS4) in our proof of Theorem 4.1.14. For example, both were necessary in deducing Lemma 4.1.12 from Lemmas 4.1.8 and 4.1.10.
4.2. Duality and the Stitching Lemma. In this section, we first explore the relationship between (weakly) JHS objects in A and Aop. Note that these classes of objects are generally not the same, as we show in Example 5.2.3. We conclude this section by showing how categories A in which every object is weakly JHS in both A and Aop allow for a generalization of length categories. In particular, we prove Theorem C from the Introduction.
Lemma 4.2.1. Let X be an object of A which satisfies (JHS1). Then X satisfies (JHS2)op; that is, X satisfies (JHS2) as an object in Aop.
Proof. Let  = {q : X  Z} be a directed system of quotient objects of X in A. Then  := {ker q | q  } is a pre-subobject chain of X. By (JHS1) and Lemma 4.0.8 we then have an exact sequence
0  colim   X  colim   0.
In particular, colim  exists.
Remark 4.2.2. We emphasize that the converse of Lemma 4.2.1 may not hold. Indeed, if  = {q : X  Z} is a directed system of quotient objects of X and colim  exists, then the kernel of the map X  colim  may not be the colimit of {ker q | q  }. See the co-Grothendieck example in Section 3.1.
Lemma 4.2.3. Let X be an object in A which satisfies (JHS1). Then the following are equivalent.
(1) X satisfies (JHS3). (2) If  is a pre-subobject chain of X and Z X is a subobject of X, then colim( + Z) =
(colim ) + Z. (3) X satisfies (JHS4)op; i.e., X satisfies (JHS4) as an object in Aop.
Proof. (1 = 2): By (JHS1), we have that colim(  Z), colim(), and colim( + Z) all exist and are subobjects of X. Moreover, Lemma 3.3.3 implies that colim(  Z) is a subobject of both Z and colim(). In fact, colim( + Z) can be seen as the colimit over Y   of the pushout of Y  Y  Z  Z. Thus since pushouts are colimits (and hence commute with other colimits), we have two pushout squares:

(colim )  Z

Z

colim(  Z)

Z

colim()

colim() + Z

colim()

colim( + Z).

where the upper left terms are assumed to be the same. It follows immediately that colim( + Z) = (colim ) + Z.
(2 = 1) : As before, we have that colim(  Z), colim(), and colim( + Z) all exist and are subobjects of X. Now note that for Y  , we have a short exact sequence

Y +Z

0Y Z Z 

 0.

Y

It then follows from Lemma 4.0.8 that there is an exact sequence

colim( + Z)

0  colim(  Z)  Z 

 0.

colim 

20

ERIC J. HANSON AND JOB D. ROCK

Likewise, there is an exact sequence

(colim ) + Z

0  (colim )  Z  Z 

 0.

colim 

Thus if colim( + Z) = (colim ) + Z, then we must have (colim )  Z = colim(  Z). (1 = 3): We will show that (JHS3)op implies (JHS4). Thus let  = {f : Y  X} be a pre-subobject chain of X and note that lim  exists by the dual of Lemma 4.2.1. Now let
 = {q : X  coker(f) | f  }. Let Z X be a subobject of X with inclusion map Z, and let r : X  coker(Z) be the corresponding quotient map. Then by (JHS3)op, we have that lim( X coker Z) = (lim ) X coker Z, and that these are quotients of X. By the dual of Lemma 4.0.8, the kernels of the corresponding quotient maps are lim( + Z) and lim() + Z,
respectively. This proves the result. (3 = 1): We will show that (JHS4) and (JHS1)op imply (JHS3)op.
Let  = {q : X  Z} be a system of quotient objects of X and let r : X  Y be a quotient of X. Let  = {ker q | q  }. By (JHS1)op, the limits lim( X Y ) and (lim ) X Y exist and are quotients of X. The dual of Lemma 4.0.8 then implies that there are exact sequences

0  lim( + ker r)  X  lim( X Y )  0

0  (lim ) + ker r  X  (lim ) X Y  0.
(JHS4) then implies that the left terms of these sequences are the same (as subobjects of X), and therefore lim( X Y ) = lim() X Y .

Remark 4.2.4. Let X be an object of an (AB5) category C (for example, the category of all left modules over some ring). We recall that for  a pre-subobject chain of X, we have colim  =
Y  Y . It then follows immediately from 4.2.3 that X satisfies (JHS3).
Putting together the results from this section, we obtain the following result. To avoid confusion, if an object X is weakly JHS in both A and Aop, we denote by sfA(X) and sfAop(X) the subfactor multisets of X as an object in A and Aop, respectively.

Proposition 4.2.5. Let X be weakly JHS in A.
(1) Then X is weakly JHS as an object in Aop if and only if X satisfies (JHS1)op. (2) Suppose X is weakly JHS as an object in Aop. Then sfA(X) = sfAop(X). In particular, X
satisfies (JHS5) if and only if it satisfies (JHS5)op.

Proof. (1) Let X be weakly JHS in A. It then follows from Lemmas 4.2.1 and 4.2.3 that X satisfies (JHS2)op and (JHS4)op. Now suppose X satisfies (JHS1)op. Since X satisfies (JHS4), Lemma 4.2.3 then implies that X satisfies (JHS3)op and is therefore weakly JHS in Aop. The other
implication follows immediately from the definition. (2) Suppose X is JHS as an object in A and weakly JHS as an object in Aop. Let  be a
composition series for X (in A) and note that by Theorem 3.3.7  admits no proper refinements. Now denote  := {X/Y | Y  } and note that  is a subobject chain of X in Aop. Moreover,
for   , denote  = {Y   | X/Y   }. Then by Lemma 4.0.8, the axioms (JHS3) and (JHS3)op imply that there are exact sequences

0

colim 

X

colim 

0

0

lim 

X

lim 

0.

In particular, for all Y  , we have (X/Y )- = X/(Y-). This implies that sf = sf. It then follows that  admits no proper refinements, and therefore is a composition series by Theorem 3.3.7.

COMPOSITION SERIES OF ARBITRARY CARDINALITY IN ABELIAN CATEGORIES

In the remainder of this section, we show that categories in which every object satisfies the hypotheses of Proposition 4.2.5 share many properties with length categories. Indeed, every object of finite length is JHS and satisfies (JHS1)op (see Proposition 5.1.1), making this setting quite natural.

Lemma 4.2.6 ("The Stitching Lemma"). Suppose every object in A is weakly JHS and satisfies (JHS1)op. Let D and E be subcategories of A which are closed under isomorphisms. If an object X
in A has a D-filtration D and each W  sf(D) has an E-filtration, then X has an E-filtration.

Proof. We explicitly construct the E-filtration. For each WY := Y /Y-D  sf(D), let Y be an E-filtration of WY . Now given jY,V : V  WY in Y , we denote the kernel of the map Y WY WY /V by hY,V : ZY,V  Y . Define Y,V := Y  hY,V and





E := 

{Y,V : ZY,V  X | V  Y } D.

WY sf(D)

Whenever V V WY , we have Y-D ZY,V ZY,V Y . Thus, E is a subobject chain of X. The compleness and cocompleteness of E follow from the fact that every object in A satisfies all of (JHS1), (JHS2), (JHS1)op, and (JHS2)op as a result of Proposition 4.2.5.

As a consequence, we obtain the final result of this section, offering a generalization of length categories.
Theorem 4.2.7 (Theorem C). Let A be a skelletally small abelian category in which every object is weakly Jordan­Hölder­Schreier and satisfies (JHS1)op. Let Y X be objects in A and consider the exact sequence
0  Y - X -q X/Y  0.
Let Y and X/Y be composition series of Y and X/Y , respectively. Then: (1) There is a composition series of X given by Y q-1(X/Y ). Moreover, this composition series induces a bijection
sf(Y ) sf(X/Y ) = sf(X).

(2) If Y and X/Y are Jordan­Hölder­Schreier, then Y = X if and only if the induced inclusion sf(Y )  sf(X) is a bijection.
Proof. (1) Let D be the full subcategory of A consisting of objects isomorphic to either Y or X/Y and let E be the full subcategory of A consisting of simple objects. We then have that {0, Y, X} is a bicomplete D-filtration with sf({0, Y, X}) = {Y, X/Y } and both Y and X/Y have E-filtrations, which are composition series by Theorem 3.3.7.
We note that {0, Y, X} is a bicomplete subobject chain. Lemma 4.2.6 then implies that there is an E-filtration (composition series) of X which refines {0, Y, X}. Moreover, by the construction in the proof of Lemma 4.2.6, we have that this composition series is given by Y q-1(X/Y ) and induces the desired bijection on subfactor sets.
(2) We have that the induced inclusion sf(Y )  sf(X) is a bijection if and only if sf(X/Y ) = . By the axiom (JHS5), this is equivalent to X/Y = 0.

5. Examples and Discussion
In this section, we provide several examples and non-examples of (weakly) Jordan­Hölder­ Schreier objects.

22

ERIC J. HANSON AND JOB D. ROCK

5.1. Finite length. We first show that Jordan­Hölder­Shreier objects generalize objects of finite length.
Proposition 5.1.1. Let X be an object in A of finite length. Then X is JHS in both A and Aop.
Proof. We note that X has finite length as an object in either A or Aop. Therefore, we need only prove that X is JHS in A.
Let  be a pre-subobject chain of X. Since X has finite length, it is both noetherian and artinian. Therefore, we know that  is a finite set. This means colim  = max , lim  = min , and both exist (and are subobjects of X). Moreover, the axioms (JHS3) and (JHS4) follow immediately from the fact that finite colimits commute with finite limits in abelian categories. Finally, suppose that  is a composition series of X and that X = 0. Since  is finite, we have X- = X and thus sf() = . We conclude that X is JHS.
5.2. Colimits of Jordan­Hölder­Schreier objects. In this section, we consider objects which are themselves colimits of (weakly) Jordan­Hölder­Schreier objects. In particular, this includes colimits of finite length objects.
Proposition 5.2.1. Let X be an object which is subobject bicomplete and satisfies (JHS3) in an abelian category A. Suppose there exists a subobject chain  of X so that X- = X and every Y   \ {X} is weakly JHS. Then X is weakly JHS. Moreover, if there exists 0 = Y   \ {X} which is JHS, then X is JHS.
Proof. Let  be a pre-subobject chain of X and let Z X be a subobject. Now for Y   \ {X}, the fact that Y is weakly JHS and intersections are limits implies that
Y  ((lim ) + Z) = lim(Y  ) + Y  Z
= lim(Y   + Y  Z)
= Y  lim( + Z)
To simplify notation, let  =  \ {X}. Since X satisfies (JHS3), we then have
(lim ) + Z = (colim  )  [(lim ) + Z]
= colim   ((lim ) + Z)
= colim   lim( + Z)
= (colim  )  lim( + Z)
= lim( + Z)
We conclude that X satisfies (JHS4) and is therefore weakly JHS. For the moreover part, suppose there exists a nonzero subobject Y X that satisfies (JHS5). Now recall from Theorem 3.3.7 that there exists a composition series  of Y , and that this composition series admits no proper refinements. Moreover, the same theorem implies that there exists a composition series  of X which is a refinement of   {X}. Since  admits no proper refinements, it follows that (Y )- = (Y )- for all Y  . In particular, we have  = sf  sf .
As an immediate corollary of Proposition 5.2.1, we obtain the following result.
Corollary 5.2.2. Let R be a ring and let  be a set of finite length (left) R-modules which is totally ordered under inclusion. Then colim  is JHS. In particular:
(1) Any Prüfer module over any ring is JHS. (2) Any countably generated (left) module over any (left) artinian ring is JHS.
Proof. We note that colim  is subobject bicomplete and satisfies (JHS3) since we are working in a module category (see Remark 4.2.4). The result thus follows immediately from Propositions 5.1.1 and 5.2.1.

We conclude this section with an important example showing that objects which are (weakly) JHS in an abelian category A may not be (weakly) JHS in Aop.

Example 5.2.3. Let k be an arbitrary field and let Vec(k) be the category of k-vector spaces. Then N k is JHS by Corollary 5.2.2. However, the limit of the pre-quotient chain
···  kkk  kk  k  0

of
N

We conclude that

5.3. Functor categories. In this section, we consider functor categories in which every object in the target is (weakly) Jordan­Hölder­Schreier. In particular, this includes the category of pointwise finite-dimensional (pwf) persistence modules over any field and small category. For certain small categories, we are further able to describe the composition factors explicitly.

Proposition 5.3.1. Let C be a small category and let A be an abelian category in which every object is weakly JHS. Then:
(1) Every object in Fun(C, A) is weakly JHS. (2) If every object in A satisfies (JHS1)op, then every object in (Fun(C, A))op is weakly JHS.

Proof. (1) Let M  Fun(C, A) and let  be a pre-subobject chain of M . For x  C, we have that colim((x)) exists and is a subobject of M (x) since M (x)  A satisfies (JHS1). It follows that colim() exists and that the natural map colim()  M is a monomorphism. Therefore, Fun(C, A) satisfies (JHS1). The proof that Fun(C, A) satisfies (JHS2) is similar.
Now let N M be an arbitrary subfunctor of M . Once again, for x  C, we have colim((x)  N (x)) = colim((x))  N (x) since M (x)  A satisfies (JHS3). It again follows immediately that colim(N ) = colim()N in Fun(C, A), and so Fun(C, A) satisfies (JHS3). The proof that (JHS4) is satisfied is again similar.
(2) We recall that Fun(C, A)op can be identified with Fun(Cop, Aop). The result thus follows from (1) and Proposition 4.2.5.

We now wish to apply Proposition 5.3.1 to pointwise finite-dimensional persistence modules. To do so, we recall that a small category C is called directed if (a) for all objects x = y  C, at least one of HomC(x, y) and HomA(y, x) is empty and (b) for all objects x  C, HomC(x, x) = {1x}. For example, any poset category is directed.
We also fix the following notation. Given an object X in an abelian category A and an object x
of a directed category C, we denote Xx : C  A the functor which has Xx(x) = X and Xx(y) = 0 for all other objects y in C. We note that Xx is simple in Fun(C, vec(k)) if and only if X is simple in A. Moreover, given a functor M : C  A, we denote by supp(M ) the set of objects x of C for which M (x) = 0. Finally, recall that the disjoint union of mutlisets is again a multiset where the multiplicity of elements is additive in the sense of cardinalities.

Theorem 5.3.2. Let C be a small directed category, let A be a skeletally small abelian category in which every object of A is JHS, and let M be a functor in Fun(C, A). Then M is Jordan­Hölder­ Schreier and satisfies

sf(M ) =

Sx | S  sf(M (x)) .

xsupp(M )

Proof. The fact that M is weakly JHS follows from Proposition 5.3.1. Since supp(M ) =  if and only if M = 0, we thus need only show the subfactors of M are as described.
We first choose some total order  on the objects of supp(M ) so that HomC(x, y) =  whenever y x and x, y  supp(M ). For each x  supp(M ), we then choose a composition series x of M (x).

24

ERIC J. HANSON AND JOB D. ROCK

Now for each X  x we define a functor Mx,X in Fun(C, A) as follows. For y an object in C, we

set we set


M (y) x y 

Mx,X (y) = X

y=x

0

y x,

For f : y  y a morphism in C, we then set Mx,X (f ) = M (f )|Mx,X(y). It is straightforward that each Mx,X is well defined.
Furthemore, we see that Mx,X My,Y if and only if either (a) y x in C, or (b) x = y in C and X Y in A. Now recall that, in a total ordered set, an interval I is closed above (respectively,
below) if y  I and y  z (respectively, z  y) implies z  I. For each interval I of objects in
supp(M ) which is closed above (with respect to ), we define a functor MI in the following way. For each object x in C, define

M (y) y  I

MI (y) = 0

y / I.

For each morphism f : y  y in C, we set MI (f ) = M (f )|MI(y). We note that if I has an infimum (with respect to ), then there are two possibilities. Either inf I / I, and so MI = Mx,0, or inf I  I, and so MI = Mx,M(x). If, on the other hand, I does not have an infimum, then MI is not equal to Mx,X for any object x in C and X  x.
We now see that

 = {Mx,X | x  supp(M ), X  X }  {MI | I  suppM is closed above}

is a subobject chain of M . It remains to show that  is a composition series and that the subfactors
of  are as described. Let x  supp(M ) and recall that x is cocomplete. If X  x has a predecessor X-x, denote
Y := X/X-x . Then (Mx,X )- = Mx,X-x , and so Mx,X /(Mx,X )- is the simple functor Yx. If X  x does not have a predecessor, then (Mx,X )- = Mx,X . Now suppose that x has an immediate successor y  supp(M ) under the restriction of ; that is, y is such that if x  z y and z  supp(M ), then z = x. In this case, it follows that Mx,0 = My,M(y). Otherwise, we have (Mx,0)- = Mx,0. Finally, suppose that I is an interval of objects in supp(M ) that is closed above such that MI = Mx,X for
any object x  C and X  X . Note that the intervals that are closed above also form a totally
ordered set under inclusion. Then there exists no interval I such that I is the predecessor or successor to I by inclusion. Thus, (MI )- = MI and (MI )+ = MI .
It follows from the above paragraph that

sf(M ) =

Sx | S  sf(M (x))

xsuppM

as claimed. This means  is a composition series if it is bicomplete. To see this, let    and, for each object x in supp(M ), denote by Ix the interval of objects in supp(M ) which is closed above and has minimal element x. Let

B ={I  supp(M ) closed above | x  supp(M ), X  x : Mx,X   , I  Ix}  {I  supp(M ) closed above | J  supp(M ) closed above : MJ   , I  J}.

In the post of interval subsets of supp(M ) (ordered by inclusion), we note that B itself is an interval
that is closed below. In particular, b = IB I is the supremum of B. If b has no infimum in supp(M ), colim  = Mb  . Otherwise, there are two possibilities. If inf b / b, then b = Ix \ {x} for some object x in supp(M ) and colim  = Mb = Mx,0  . If inf(b)  b, then b = Ix for some object x in supp(M ). Then let x = {X  x | Mx,X   }. Since inf(b)  b, we see x = . It

follows that colim  = Mx,colim x  . We conclude that  is cocomplete. The argument that  is complete is similar.

We now specialize Proposition 5.3.1 and Theorem 5.3.2 to obtain Theorem D from the introduction.

Corollary 5.3.3 (Theorem D).

(1) Let C be a directed small category, let k be a field, and let M : C  vec(k) be a pointwise finite-dimensional C-persistence module. Then M is Jordan­Hölder­Schreier and satisfies

dimk M (x)



sf(M ) =



kx  .

i=1

(2) Let A be an abelian category such that every object of A is Jordan­Hölder­Schreier and let X be a topological space. Then any presheaf on X with values in A is Jordan­Hölder­Schreier.

Proof. (1) For any field k, every object in vec(k) is JHS by Proposition 5.1.1. (2) The source category T op(X)op of a presheaf is the opposite category of a directed category, and so itself is
directed.

Remark 5.3.4. We note that the proof technique for Corollary 5.3.3 will not work for all sheaves
O of a space X with values in A. Suppose there is a covering {Ui} of U in T op(X) and a pair sj  O(Uj) and sk  O(Uk) such that sj|UjUk = sk|UjUk = 0. Then OU,0 is not a sheaf. However, it remains an interesting question: if every object of A is JHS, when does a sheaf O on a space X
with values in A have a composition series of sheaves in the sense of Definition 3.2.6?

5.4. Igusa and Todorov's representations of R. In this section we show that the (nonzero) represenations examined by Igusa and Todorov in [IT15] are weakly JHS, but are not JHS. We recall from Section 2.3 that for k an arbitrary field, we denote by Fun(R, vec(k)) the category of (covariant) functors from R, considered as a poset category, to the category of finite-dimensional k-vector spaces. Moreover, given M  Fun(R, vec(k)) and x  y  R, we denote by M (x, y) the result of applying M to the unique morphism x  y in R.

Definition 5.4.1. We denote by IT(R) the full subcategory of Fun(R, vec(k)) consisting of functors M : R  vec(k) be a functor which satisfy the following.
(IT1) For all x  R, we have limy>x V (y) = V (x) and (IT2) For all but finitetly many x  R, there exists  > 0 such that M (x, x + ) is an isomorphism.
In [IT15], Igusa and Todorov studied functors Rop  vec(k) that satisfied the symmetric condition to (IT1) and the same condition (IT2) in Definition 5.4.1. We may then use their results.

Theorem 5.4.2 (Adapted from [IT15]).
(1) The category IT(R) is an abelian and extension closed subcategory of Fun(R, vec(k)). (2) For every interval I that is closed below and open above, there is an interval indecomposable
MI in IT(R) given by

MI (x) =

k 0

xI x / I

MI (x, y) =

1k 0

xyI otherwise.

(3) Every representation in IT(R) is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of interval indecomposables. This direct sum is unique up to permuting the direct summands.

We note that (2) includes intervals of the form [a, +) for every a  R. By results in [BC-B20, IRT19+], each object in Fun(R, vec(k)) is also a direct sum of interval indecomposables, but the intervals may be of any form and the sum may be infinite.

ERIC J. HANSON AND JOB D. ROCK

We have already shown in Propositions 5.1.1 and 5.3.1 that each object M in IT(R) is JHS when considered as an object in Fun(R, vec(k)). However, as a subcategory of Fun(R, vec(k)), IT(R) is not closed under subobjects. As a result, the colimits and limits of pre-subobject chains will generally differ depending on which category we are working in. The following lemma describes this relationship precisely. To increase readability in the proof of the lemma, we use for direct sums of objects and for sums of morphisms using the abelian structure of IT(R).
Lemma 5.4.3. Let X be an object in IT(R) and  a pre-subobject chain of X in IT(R).
(1) Let colimFun  :=  MI be the colimit of  in Fun(R, vec(k)). Then the colimit of  in IT(R) is given by colimIT  :=  MIinf(I).
(2) The limit limFun  of  in Fun(R, vec(k)) is also the limit of  in IT(R).
Proof. By Proposition 5.3.1, we know colimFun  and limFun  exist and are subfunctors of M . By [IRT19+, Theorem 3.0.1], we know that M , and thus colimFun  and limFun , are finitely generated in Fun(R, vec(k)). In particular, this means colimFun  and limFun  are finite direct sums of interval indecomposables. It follows that both limFun  and colimFun  satisfy (IT2).
To see that limFun  satisfies (IT1), we note that for all x  R, we have that (in vec(k))

lim
y>x

(limFun(y))

=

lim
N 

lim N (y)
y>x

.

Since each N   is in IT(R), this implies that limy>x (limFun (y)) = limFun (x), as desired.

Now write colimFun  =

m i=1

indecomposable. Let  : colimFun

MIi and M

M be

= the

p k=1

MKk

,

where

each

MIi

and

inclusion map and write  =

MKk
m i=1

is an interval

p k=1

i,k ,

with

each i,k : MIi  MKk . We claim that each Ii is open on the right. Indeed, if Ii is closed on the

right, then there exists some Kk so that (i,k)sup Ii : MIi(sup Ii)  MKk (sup Ii) is nonnzero. But

this can only happen if suppIi = suppKk  Kk, a contradiction. In particular, this implies that

colimIT(R) is indeed an object in IT(R).

It remains to show that colimIT(R) satisfies the universal property of the colimit. To see this,

let N = nj=1MJj be an object in IT(R) and let g =

m i=1

n j=1

gi,j

:

MIi



MJj

be

a

morphism

in Fun(R, vec(k)). Since each Jj is closed on the left by assumption, it follows that each gi,j factors

through MIiinf Ii. Thus, g factors through colimIT(R) . This proves the result.

Proposition 5.4.4. Every nonzero object X in IT(R) is weakly JHS but not JHS.

Proof. We first show every object is weakly JHS and then show that IT(R) has no simple objects. This will imply that sf(M ) =  for all objects M of IT(R), and so no nonzero object in IT(R) is JHS.
Let M be an object of IT(R). We note that M satisfies (JHS1), (JHS2), and (JHS4) in IT(R) as an immediate consequence of Proposition 5.3.1 and Lemma 5.4.3. To see that M satisfies (JHS3), let  be a pre-subobject chain of M . Then for Z a subobject of M in IT(R), Proposition 5.3.1 implies that colimFun(  Z) = (colimFun )  Z. Now, for x  R, the description of colimits in the category IT(R) given in Lemma 5.4.3 implies that

((colimIT)  Z)(x) = yli>mx((colimFun)  Z)(y) = yli>mx(colimFun(  Z))(y) = (colimIT(  Z))(x).

Thus, M satisfies (JHS4) in IT(R). Now we show that IT(R) contains no simple objects. For contradiction, suppose S is simple in
IT(R). Then S = MI for some interval I that is closed below and open above. However, this means that inf I = sup I, and so there exists  > 0 such that inf I <  + inf I < sup I. Then M[+inf I,sup I) is a subobject of S, a contradiction.

COMPOSITION SERIES OF ARBITRARY CARDINALITY IN ABELIAN CATEGORIES

27

Example 5.4.5. Let I = [a, b) for a pair of real numbers a < b. Then

 = {M[x,b) | a  x < b}  {0}
is a composition series of MI in IT(R) which satisfies sf = .
5.5. Non-example: infinite products. We conclude by showing that infinite products in general are not (weakly) JHS and can admit two composition series with different cardinalities of subfactor multisets. We note that the following setting example in particular.

Proposition 5.5.1. Let A be an abelian category which is possibly not skeletally small and has both arbitrary coproducts and arbitrary products. Then

(1) If S is a nonzero object in A, then the infinite product S does not satisfy (JHS4), and
N
is therefore not weakly JHS.
(2) If S is simple in A, then the infinite product S admits composition series  and  with
N
|sf()| = |N| = |EndA(S))||N| = |sf()|.

Proof. (1) For clarity, denote X =

S.
N

Now

for

each

n



N,

denote

Xn

:=

N\[0,n] and consider

the inclusion Xn  X given by mapping the i-th factor to the i-th factor. We then obtain a

subobject chain  = {0, . . . , X2, X1, X} of X.

Again for clarity, denote 0 =  \ {0}. We claim that lim 0 = 0. To see this, consider any

nonzero map f : M  X. Then there must be a smallest j  N so that the composition j  f of f

with the j-th projection map is nonzero. Then f does not factor through the inclusion Xj+1 X,

and so f is not a solution to 0. We conclude that lim 0 = 0 as claimed.

Now consider the subobject Y := S of X, with the inclusion map again mapping the i-th
N
factor to the i-th factor. We note that for n  N, we have


Y + Xn =   
N\[0,n]

n
S
i=0

= X.

This implies that that (lim 0) + Y = Y X = lim(0 + Y ). This proves the result. (2) Let S be simple in A, and let X, , and 0 be as in the proof of (1). We claim  is then a
composition series of S.
Indeed, it is clear that  is bicomplete, since any    contains a maximal element and either contains a minimal element or satisfies lim  = lim 0 = 0. Moreover, we have X- = X0 and X/X0 = S. Likewise, for n  N, we have (Xn)- = Xn+1 and Xn/Xn+1 = S. We conclude that all of the subfactors of  are simple, and therefore  is a composition series which satisfies |sf()| = |N|.
We now construct a second composition series of X with larger cardinality. To begin, we note
that since S is simple, the ring EndA(S) is either a field or division ring. Thus we have that

HomA (S, X) = EndA(S)op

N
is a free EndA(S)op-module. It is well-known that the (EndA(S)op)-dimension of this module is |EndA(S)||N|, which in particular is uncountable. See e.g. [J53, Theorem XI.5.2]. Thus choose some basis B of HomS(S, X) and choose a well-order  on B for which B contains a minimal element b0 and maximal element b1.
Now for any subset B  B, denote

XB := im(b).
bB
We note that if B B  B, then there is a proper inclusion XB  XB . Moreover, we have XB = X. Since B is well-ordered, we then have a subobject chain
 = 0, X{b0}, XB  X[b0,b) | b  B \ {b0}

of X. Now let   . If 0   , then clearly lim  = 0  . Otherwise, define

J0 :=

I

and

J1 :=

I.

IB:XI 

IB:XI 

It follows that lim  = XJ0   and colim  = XJ1  . We conclude that  is bicomplete.

Moreover, X[b0,b] and

we have 0+ X[b0,b]/X[b0

=

=XS{b.0

} and X{b0}/0 = S We conclude that

Likewise, for b  is a composition

B \ {b0}, we have (X[b0,b))+ series and |sf()| = |B|.
