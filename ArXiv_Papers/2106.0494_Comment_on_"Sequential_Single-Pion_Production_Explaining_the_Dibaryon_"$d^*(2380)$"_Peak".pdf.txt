In Ref. [1] a two-step process pn  (pp)-  (N )-  (d+)- was calculated by using experimental total cross sections for the single-pion production processes pn  pp-(I = 0) and pp  d+. As a result the authors obtain a resonance-like structure for the total pn  d+- cross section of about the right size and width of the observed d(2380) peak at an energy about 40 MeV below the d(2380) mass. We object both the results of the sequential process calculation and its presentation as an alternative to the dibaryon interpretation.

In what is called an unavoidable result of the sequen-

tial process the authors of Ref. [1] present their ansatz as

an alternative to the dibaryon interpretation of the resonance structure d(2380) observed in the d+- channel

[2]. Note that this resonance has been observed in all

possible hadronic decay channels [3­8]. A signal of it has

also been reported in photoexcitation of the deuteron [9­

14]. For recent reviews see Refs. [15, 16].

We object both the results of the sequential process

calculation and its presentation as an alternative to the

dibaryon interpretation as follows:

(i) For the isoscalar pn(I = 0)  pp- reaction

the WASA@COSY results [17] are used in Ref. [1] by

enlarging the relatively small statistical uncertainties

enourmeously by adding in quadrature a large system-

atic error due isospin violation. We think that since the

latter is not fluctuating randomly from energy point to

energy point, it does not behave like statistical uncer-

tainties and can not just be added to them. Only by this

procedure the authors of Ref. [1] can arrive at a width as

narrow as 70 MeV in a Breit-Wigner fit to the observed

structure in the isoscalar pn  pp- cross section. In

our fits to this structure we obtain a width of about 150

MeV Ref. [17, 18]. Note that the width of this first-step

process is crucial for the calculated narrow width of the structure in the final d+- channel.

(ii) The fact that the peak calculated for the d+-

channel misses the measured peak by about 40 MeV is

associated in olution of 20

RMeefV.[1i]nwitsh.

a pretended experimental resHowever, here the authors of

Ref. [1] mix the experimental resolution erroneously up

with the bin width used for the presentation of differen-

tial distributions in Ref. [2]. The binning used for the

presentation of total cross section was 1 MeV in Ref. [2],

since the high precision COSY beam had a resolution in

the sub-MeV range. The position of the peak calculated

in Ref. [1] rather is determined by the data point at 2.33

GeV in the isoscalar single-pion production [17], which

constitutes just a statistically insignificant excursion.

(iii) As shown by many partial-wave analyses [15, 19] of the pp  d+ reaction the incident 1D2 partial wave is the by far dominating partial wave. Since in the isoscalar N -invariant mass spectrum of the np  pp- reaction the strength accumulates at highest masses (Fig. 6 of Ref.[17]), it follows already from kinematics that the strength in the associated pp-invariant mass spectrum accumulates at lowest masses - in accordance with a dominance of S- and P -waves between the final pp pair (see also the partial-wave analysis of Ref. [20]). This is at variance with the requirements for incident 1D2 pp-waves in the second step reaction. With just low-energetic incident S- and P -waves available the second step reaction provides only tiny cross sections and so does the full sequential process.
(iv) Consistent d(2380) signals have also been observed in the non-fusion channels np00 [4], np+- [5] and in pp0- [6], which are impossible to be explained by the sequential process ansatz due to the absence of the triangle singularity.
(v) The concept of Ref. [1] does not allow for any detailed check with data, since it does not provide any differential distributions.
(vi) The sequential process cannot reproduce the observed pole in the 3D3 -3 G3 np-partial waves at 2380 MeV [7]. Since the sequential process produces a variety of spin-parity combinations, it produces also poles in several partial waves at 2.33 GeV simultaneously, which are excluded by the partial-wave analyses [7, 19].
(vii) In contrast to the claim in Ref. [1] various evidences for d(2380) signals have been observed in d  d00 [12­14] and d  pn reactions [9­11], see, e.g., the discussion in Ref. [16].
(viii) In order to demonstrate the invalidity of the sequential single-pion production ansatz by yet another example, let us consider instead of the isoscalar part now the isovector part of the np  pp- reaction. In this case we deal with the two-pion production process np(I = 1)  d+-. Since the isovector part of the

2

pp- channel is larger than its isoscalar part by roughly a factor of four [17] at the energy of the d(2380) peak, we would expect the cross secton for the isovector part of the d+- channel to be larger than its isoscalar part by just this factor at the position of d(2380). In reality its is smaller by a factor of ten [2, 16] and the sequential single-pion production ansatz fails again vastly.
We finally note that it is already the knowledge of the pole in the 3D3 np-partial wave and its associated Argand circle [7], which makes the resonance structure in the various N N  channels unavoidable [16].
