ABSTRACT
We investigate photometric variations due to stellar activity which induce systematic radial-velocity errors (so-called "jitter") for the four targets in the Hyades open cluster observed by the K2 mission (EPIC 210721261, EPIC 210923016, EPIC 247122957, and EPIC 247783757). Applying Gaussian process regressions to the K2 light curves and the near-infrared (NIR) light curves observed with the IRSF 1.4-m telescope, we derive the wavelength dependences of the photometric signals due to stellar activity. To estimate the temporal variations in the photometric variability amplitudes between the two observation periods of K2 and IRSF, separated by more than 2 years, we analyze a number of K2 targets in Hyades that have also been observed in Campaigns 4 and 13 and find a representative variation rate over 2 years of 38% ± 71%. Taking this temporal variation into account, we constrain projected sizes and temperature contrast properties of the starspots in the stellar photosphere to be approximately 10% and 0.95, respectively. These starspot properties can induce relatively large differences in the variability amplitude over different observational passbands, and we find that radial-velocity jitter may be more suppressed in the NIR than previously expected. Our result supports profits of on-going exoplanet search projects that are attempting to detect or confirm young planets in open clusters via radial-velocity measurements in the NIR.

1. INTRODUCTION
Exoplanetary studies have made great progress with the help of space telescope missions such as NASA's Kepler space telescope (Borucki et al. 2010). In particular, Kepler's secondary mission, K2, conducted a systematic survey of young transiting planets in stellar clusters (< 1 Gyr), that were not included in the original mission (e.g., Hyades (650 Myr, Mart´in et al. 2018), Pleades (112 Myr, Dahm 2015), and Upper Scorpius (11 Myr, Pecaut et al. 2012)). Several planets have been confirmed and/or validated around these young stars (e.g., Mann et al. 2016a,b, 2017), which are important to study to determine the formation and evolutionary processes of exoplanets, as well as their primordial atmospheres. More recently, an all-sky survey by the T ES S mission (Ricker et al. 2015) also revealed young exoplanets in other stellar associations (e.g., Newton et al. 2019; Rizzuto et al. 2020; Mann et al. 2020).
Even though the sky regions being surveyed have expanded, the number of planets detected around young stars

remains far more limited ( 30) than those around their older counterparts. One reason for the small number of detections are the high surface activities of these young host stars. When the brightness of the stellar surface is inhomogenious (e.g., includes spots and plages), apparent modulations due to stellar rotation appear in radial velocity (RV) measurements. These activity-induced apparent signals, so-called "RV jitters", prevent the detection of true planetary signals (e.g., Queloz et al. 2001; Paulson et al. 2004). In particular, less is known concerning the properties of RV jitter for low-mass stars (M dwarfs) as a result of their intrinsic faintness, despite the fact that starspots tend to exist longer on M dwarfs than on solar-type stars and could affect their long-term RV variability (Robertson et al. 2014, 2020; Davenport et al. 2015). Recent studies have suggested that planetary radii around young stars are significantly larger than those around old stars in the low-mass region (< 0.6 M , e.g., Obermeier et al. 2016; Mann et al. 2018; Rizzuto et al. 2020). Studies of young low-mass stars are important to test for the scenarios

that explain the difference in the radius distributions, including atmospheric escape (e.g., Owen 2019).
In general, it is known that RV jitter is reduced in the nearinfrared (NIR) relative to optical wavelengths because the contrast between starspots and the photosphere is smaller at longer wavelengths (Bean et al. 2010; Reiners & Basri 2010; Anglada-Escude´ et al. 2013; Tal-Or et al. 2018; Robertson et al. 2020). However, the number of observational samples available for systematic studies of stellar activity is still small and the detailed properties of starspots are concealed, especially for young M dwarfs. Measuring stellar RVs is one of the promising methods to study the detailed properties of jitter, such as their wavelength dependence (e.g., Robertson et al. 2020); however, it is time-consuming to obtain a sufficiently large number of observations, especially for optically faint targets such as M dwarfs. Frasca et al. (2009) have approached this problem using photometric observations; however, their targets have been limited to pre-mainsequence stars ( 10 Myr) that show large photometric variations (> 10 %). Therefore, reduced jitter in the NIR and its wavelength dependence have not been robustly established for various types of stars of different ages. For a more accurate understanding of young exoplanets, it is necessary to constrain the behavior of stellar rotational activity using both photometry and spectroscopy.
In this study, we evaluate the observational behavior of stellar rotational activity in the NIR. We focus on M dwarfs in the Hyades open cluster (650 Myr; Mart´in et al. 2018) that were photometrically observed by the K2 mission, and we investigate stellar jitter using multicolor photometry combining the K2 and NIR light curves. We also estimate the starspot sizes and temperatures using a toy model. Our approach allows us to roughly understand the properties of starspots for targets showing relatively small ( 1 %) simple photometric variabilities with 1-m-class telescopes.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce our targets and follow-up observations using the NIR multicolor photometry. We show the analytic procedure for the targets involving Gaussian process regression in Section 3. Section 4 presents an estimation of the starspot properties. Finally, we discuss our interpretations of the results compared to previous studies and give a conclusion in Section 5.
2. TARGETS AND OBSERVATIONS
2.1. K2 Targets in the Hyades Open Cluster
K2 is the secondary mission of the Kepler space telescope to detect transiting exoplanet candidates along the ecliptic plane (Howell et al. 2014). Some K2 campaign fields include young clusters. To reduce systematic effects when studying the properties of starspot, such as those associated with age and metallicity, we focused on young stars belonging to a

single open cluster. We selected targets from the Hyades open cluster with typical metallicity [Fe/H] and age values of approximately 0.14 ± 0.05 and 650 ± 70 Myr, respectively (Perryman et al. 1998; Brandt & Huang 2015; Mart´in et al. 2018).
We picked four preferable targets for ground-based followup observations that are relatively bright and have short rotation periods (< 10magK and < 3 days) from the VizieR table 1 reported in Douglas et al. (2019): EPIC 210721261, EPIC 210923016, EPIC 247122957, and EPIC 247783757. Transiting planetary candidates have not been detected for these targets. The K2 data were collected on Campaign 13, which was from March 8 to May 27, 2017. We use the Pre-search Data Conditioned-Simple Aperture Photometry light curves dowloaded from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes portal2. For this study, we normalized the overall long-term systematic modulations using a fifth-order polynomial function and removed flux outliers via 5 -  clipping, to focus on periodic variations due to stellar rotation. We summarize the properties of the targets in Table 1. The stellar effective temperatures and radii are derived by V - J vs Teff relation and MK vs R relation from Mann et al. (2015), respectively; the masses are by MK vs M relation from Mann et al. (2019) with the metallicity of 0.15.
We also estimated the stellar properties using different equations, because young active stars have large uncertainties in the colors due to their inhomogeneous surfaces (Stauffer et al. 2003). Additional estimations for Teff and R using the BP - RP vs Teff and Teff vs R relations, respectively from

(Mann et al. 2015), are listed in the bottom of Table 1. These values deviate by about 1 from the original estimations, which means that there are large uncertainties in the broadband colors. In addition, we checked the CaII HK (393.4 nm and 396.8 nm) and H (656.3 nm) emission lines as activity indicators using low-resolution spectra observed with the the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST; ?)3. The spectral data are available for EPIC 210721261, EPIC 210923016, and EPIC 247783757. All the three targets exhibit significant emissions at those lines as in Figure 1. Thus, we conclude that our targets are very active and it is possible that the systematic errors in the effective temperatures are underestimated. In later discussions, we will take into account this point to interpret the results more accurately.
2.1.1. Rotation Periods
For the selected target stars, we first investigated the periodic modulations in the K2 light curves and determined the rotation period for each target. To do so, we applied the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram (GLS; Zechmeister
3 http://dr6.lamost.org/v2/search

& Ku¨rster 2009) to unbinned K2 light curves; the results are shown in Figure 2 with the black solid line. In addition, we computed the autocorrelation function (ACF; McQuillan et al. 2013) using the same datasets to confirm the periods identified in the GLS periodogram. For EPIC 210721261, EPIC 247122957 and EPIC 247783757, the same periods were detected by both GLS and ACF and we adopted these periods for the subsequent analyses. For EPIC 210923016, the highest peak was detected at 0.58 days in GLS. ACF, however, showed the highest peak at 1.16 days, which is twice the GLS period. The 0.58-day peak is an upper harmonic of 1.16 day and likely due to multiple starspots on the surface, and we concluded that 1.16 days is the true rotation period of the star. Finally, via visual inspection, we confirmed semi-coherent modulations with the determined periods in the K2 light curves for all targets (Figure 4).
2.1.2. Possibility of Binary
Because we are trying to constrain the starspot properties (e.g., sizes and temperatures) from multicolor photometric observations, it is important to rule out the presence of nearby (companion) stars in the photometric aperture because, when a light curve is diluted by flux contamination from nearby stars, the interpretation of the amplitude of the light curve

modulations is more complicated. To ensure of the absence of possible companion stars, we inspected nearby stars listed in the 2MASS (Cutri et al. 2003), SDSS (Adelman-McCarthy & et al. 2009), and Gaia (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018) catalogs on the VizieR website4, and found that there are no resolved companions within 3 . However, it is difficult to completely eliminate the possibility of binaries, because high-precision adaptive optic observations have not been performed. Therefore, to evaluate the binarity of the targets, we employed the thresholds described in Evans (2018) for the Astrometric Goodness of Fit in the Along-Scan direction (GOF AL) and the Significance of the Astrometric Excess Noise (D) in the Gaia second data release (DR2; Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016, 2018). These parameters char-

acterize the agreement between an astrometric model and the data depending on the presence of unresolved companions. Evans (2018) set the threshold of binarity condition to GOF AL > 20 and D > 5. In addition, we reffered the Renormalised Unit Weight Error (RUWE) statistics in the Gaia early third data release (EDR3; Gaia Collaboration et al. 2020), which is discussed in Stassun & Torres (2021). They suggest that RUWE is strongly correlated to binarity condition for 1.0 < RUWE < 1.4. We list the GOF AL and D values in DR2 and RUWE values in EDR3 for our targets in Table 1.
For EPIC 210721261, the GOF AL and D values are 14.9 and 0.0, respectively, which are significantly lower than the thresholds; therefore, the possibility of a binary is low. EPIC 247122957, whose GOF AL and D values are relatively large (51.0 and 48.2, respectively) may host a companion. For the other two targets, EPIC 210923016 and EPIC 247783757, even though their GOF AL and D are slightly above the thresholds, we cannot confidently suggest their status as binaries. While the GOF AL and D values were recently updated in EDR3 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2020), we cannot directly compare them, because the thresholds in Evans (2018) were derived from the DR2 data. However, we found that the EDR3 GOF AL values were all well under 20, except that of EPIC 247122957. With regard to RUWE, the value for EPIC 247122957 is high and deviated from the correlated range (6.51), while these for the other targets are relatively small ( 1.2). Consequently, EPIC 210721261, EPIC 210923016, and EPIC 247783757 seem to be single stars with high probability from the aspect of astrometry.
Douglas et al. (2019) mentioned that rapid rotating early M-dwarfs in Hyades with periods of  1 day are likely binaries, whereas the typical period of them is 10 days. To discuss the binarities further, we also derived stellar radii based on different photometry. We show the additional radii estimated with Teff vs R relation in Mann et al. (2015) to Table 1 in italic; the Teff is derived from V - J color. There are approximately 2 -  deviations from the radii derived from MK for all the targets. One explanation for these systematics is that our targets may be entirely binaries. If it was true, fluxes from the companions are likely not dominant, because the periodgrams in K p band show single peaks excluding harmonics for all the targets. In Section 5, we test a dilution effect by a companion star to discuss uncertainties in the case where the targets are binaries.
2.2. Follow-up Observations, IRSF 1.4m / SIRIUS
From November 14 to 26, 2019, we conducted follow-up observations with the Simultaneous Infrared Imager for Unbiased Survey (SIRIUS; Nagashima et al. 1999) on the IRSF 1.4 m telescope at the South Africa Astronomical Observatory. SIRIUS is equipped with three 1 k × 1 k HgCdTe detectors with a pixel scale of 0. 45 pixel-1. This enables us to

take three NIR images in the J, H, and Ks bands simultaneously with the same exposure time for all bands. Setting the exposure times to 30 s with a dead time of approximately 8 s for all bands, we observed the 4 targets in rotation during a night. Each target was observed for approximately 30 minutes per visit, and was visited two or three times per night. The weather conditions were generally good, and observations were carried out nearly every night.
Aperture photometry for each raw fits file has been performed using the customized pipeline described in Fukui et al. (2011). For each target, we employed two or three stars in the same frame as reference stars, and checked that their flux variations were negligible. Because there are systematic errors due to the observational circumstances, we applied systematic correction to the light curves, as described in Fukui et al. (2013); here, we employed the pixel positions of the target and airmass as correction parameters. Then, we binned the light curves into 0.05-day sized bins adopting the weighted mean for each bin. Uncertainties were calculated by propagating the Poisson noise in each bin.
We tested the reproducibility of the periodicities identified in the K2 photometry using the GLS periodograms. The results are shown in Figure 2 as solid colored solid lines for all four targets. The horizontal dashed line represents the false alarm probability of 0.1% (FAP; Zechmeister & Ku¨rster 2009) in the J band. For almost targets, peaks higher than the 0.1% FAP lines were detected in the J and H bands, and

the periodicities in the Ks band were not detected with sufficient significance. This is because the detector is known to be unstable, and the systematic errors were larger than the astrophysical signals for the Ks band. We show the light curves for the four targets in the J band observed with IRSF/SIRIUS in Figure 3. The light curves were folded with the periods detected using the GLS.
3. GP REGRESSION TO THE LIGHT CURVES
We applied Gaussian process (GP) regression to quantify the behaviors of starspots in the light curves (Rasmussen & Williams 2006; Haywood et al. 2014; Grunblatt et al. 2015; Hirano et al. 2016). Detail of GP is described in Appendix A. In the following, we explain how to treat the observed light curves with GP.
3.1. Analysis of the K2 Light Curves
First, we analyzed the K2 light curves using GP to reproduce the flux variations due to stellar rotation, because these curves are sufficiently precise and were collected over a long period with good cadence. We binned the light curves into 0.1-day ranges considering the computational cost and the rotation period. We employed the quasi-periodic kernel (Kqp; Equation (A3)) in the GP regressions. This is because signals induced by stellar jitter show both periodicities due to stellar rotations and coherent variations due to surface activities. To optimize the hyperparameters, we used the Mar-

cov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) and added Gaussian priors based on the rotation periods in Table 2 for . We set the number of walkers and steps to 50 and 104, respectively. The initial positions of the parameters h, w, , and  were set to [10-3, 10-1], [10-1, 102], [10-1, 102], and [10-4, 10-2], respectively with uniform distirbutions.
The derived hyperparameters in this analysis are listed in the upper part of Table 2. We indicate the mean with a solid line and the 1 -  and 2 -  uncertainties of the GP analyses with colored regions in Figure 4. We see quasi-stable, periodic variations for all targets.

We ran 104 MCMC steps and ensured the convergence of the chains in the first 103 steps.
For the ground-based photometric data (J, H, and Ks), there are large systematic errors arising from instrumental and/or weather conditions. Because of the lack of accurate modeling of these systematic errors, the astrophysical signals originating from the intrinsic stellar activity could be overestimated or underestimated. Using trial- and error- approach, we found that the following GP kernel, which combines the quasi-periodic and squared exponential kernels can most effectively describe the behavior in the observed light curves:

Ki, j = Kiq,pj + Kisq,

(1)

3.2. Joint GP Analysis
Next, we measured the variation amplitudes h over all the passbands (K p, J, H, and Ks) using a Bayesian approach, to evaluate the wavelength dependencies of the stellar rotational activity. For the K2 light curves, we applied the quasiperiodic kernel (Equation (A3)) with , w, and  set to the values determined in Section 3.1, and re-derived h and .

where the subscripts i and j indicate the passbands and the target ID, respectively. The first term Kiq,pj is the quasiperiodic kernel which reproduces the intrinsic stellar flux variations. We fixed the hyperparameters in Kiq,pj to the values in the K p band except h and . This is because the ground-
based light curve data are sparse and it is difficult to accu-
rately derive all the relevant parameters for the stellar jitter
from the ground-based photometry alone, as seen in the treat-

ment of the RV data in Haywood et al. (2014). Assuming that the covariance length scales and smoothing parameters are independent of the observational passband (wavelength), we allowed only h and , which are expected to depend on the passband, to float freely for each passband and each target. The second term Kisq is the squared exponential kernel, which only accounts for the instrumental systematic errors for each passband, in which the relevant hyperparameters are shared for all four targets.
We list the mean values of each hyperparameter whose uncertainties were calculated to be in the range of 68.3% from

The smooth sinusoidal modulations represent the astrophysical signals modeled by Kqi,pj , whereas the sudden fluctuations correspond to the systematic errors modeled by Kisq.

the periodicities are weak for most of the targets as in Figure 2, the light curves are dominated by the sudden fluctuations due to instrumental effects. In total, the estimated amplitudes in NIR are from approximately half to one-third of those in the K p band, while there appears to be no significant differences between the NIR passbands. In particular for EPIC 210721261, the amplitude ratios for the K p and H bands are as large as 7:1.
Generally, there is a possibility that the shape of the photometric variations changed during K2 and IRSF observations, even though we fixed the hyperparameter w and  in this GP regression. On the other hand, our four targets show stable photometric modulations as in Figure 4. The periodgram analysis also suggests that they have single periodicities and no significant differential rotation (Reinhold et al. 2013). Davenport et al. (2015) performed light curve analysis for a rapidly rotating ( 0.6 day) M-dwarf using Kepler photometry and suggested that a starspot was very stable over many years. In addition, we succeeded to detect the rotation periods from the discrete ground-based photometry, which means the photometric variations were not complicated in the IRSF observations. Thus, we conclude that our estimations are likely consistent with the true nature of the targets.

4. ESTIMATED STARSPOT PROPERTIES
4.1. Starspot Variations over 2 Years
As noted in Section 2.2, the IRSF data were observed in November 2019, while the K2 data from Campaign 13 were observed from March 8 to May 27, 2017. meaning that these two observations were not simultaneous but were separated by approximately 1.5 years. Within this time interval, the

properties of the surface activity (jitter) may have significantly altered. Therefore, before quantitatively comparing the flux-modulation amplitudes in the K2 and IRSF data, we need to assess any long-term variations in the stellar surface activity. To do so, we focused on multiple observations of the same stars in the K2 mission; K2 observed the Hyades cluster during both Campaigns 4 and 13, spanning a time interval of approximately 2 years. By comparing the photometric data taken during the two different campaigns, we can evaluate the long-term, temporal evolution of the surface activity. Note that our targets which are rapidly rotating M-dwarfs are not typical in Hyades. Thus, we use targets whose rotation periods are less than 10 days to focus on such a specific class of M-dwarfs (Douglas et al. 2019).
While our targets were only observed in Campaign 13, we found that 333 EPIC targets were observed in both campaigns. Because we are focusing on cool stars in this study, we selected 95 targets with temperatures below 4000 K according the EPIC catalog (Huber et al. 2016). We normalized the light curves and removed the flux outliers as in Section 2.1. We computed the GLS periodograms to determine their rotation periods. The detection threshold in the GLS power for the K2 data was set to roughly 0.1 in reference to the periodograms in Figure 2. Consequently, we detected 19 targets whose GLS peaks are larger than 0.1 and whose periods are shorter than 10 days in either of the two campaigns. We measured the typical flux semi-amplitudes of the phase folded light curves for the 19 targets for both campaigns using GP. Here, we use the periodic kernel Kp in consideration of computational cost in the optimization with MCMC.
Examples of the folded light curves and results of the GP regressions are shown in Figure 13 in Appendix B. The properties and derived hyperparameters are listed in Table 5. One can see variations in the modulation amplitude and/or shape between the two campaigns. In Figure 6, we plot the results for all targets, showing the modulation amplitudes for Campaigns 4 and 13. The absolute variation in the amplitude is calculated as h = |h13 - h04|, where h04 and h13 are the relative flux-variation amplitudes for Campaigns 4 and 13, respectively. We derived a weighted mean of h for 19 targets of 0.0097±0.0094. The relative variation with respect to Campaign 4 (r  h/h04) was determined to be 38% ± 71%; therefore, that the variation in the modulation amplitudes at a timescale of  2 years (between Campaigns 4 and 13) is likely lower than 100% of the original flux modulation.
4.2. Estimations of Starspot Sizes and the Temperatures
To understand the behaviors and properties of starspots more quantitatively, we estimated their sizes and temperatures from the amplitudes measured in the multicolor photometry. In general, it is difficult to solve degeneracies on surface properties (e.g., starspot latitude, number of starspots,

and inclination) from shape of light curves as described in (Luger et al. 2021). Therefore, we employed a very simple toy model, which considers only the maximum projected size and temperature (see Figure 7), because we focus only on "relative" variations between different passbands, which are independent of the geometric structures of the photosphere and starspots. In the fiducial case, the variation amplitudes are determined from the appearance and disappearance of the starspots, we ignore the effect of the limb-darkening in this analysis. The modeled semi-amplitude hmodel is calculated as follows

hmodel = (1 - fspot/ fphot) × S /2,

(2)

where fspot and fphot are the fluxes of the starspot and the photsphere, respectively, and S represents the projected size of the starspot relative to the stellar disc, i.e., S = 1.0 means that a starspot covers a stellar hemisphere. We used the PHOENIX atmosphere model (BT-SETTL ; Allard et al. 2013) to derive the photometric fluxes from the temperatures of the spot (Tspot) and photosphere (Tphot). We generated the

model spectra using a step of 100 K for the effective temperature from 1600 K to 4000 K, and interpolated the intermediate values using a the third-order spline curve with the metallicity set to 0.0. We derived the photometric flux for each observational passband as the photon count per unit area by multiplying the model spectra by the response function for each passband and integrating with respect to the wavelength (e.g., Fukugita et al. 1995). The response functions are taken from the websites for each instrument56. We used the measured amplitudes h in Section 3.2 for the observed values. Because there are systematic uncertainties due to the different observational windows for the K2 and IRSF runs, as in Section 4.1, we added the relative variation r to the errors in the K2 data in quadrature such that ((hKp × r)2 + 2Kp)1/2, where Kp is the internal error for hKp. The photospheric temperature Tphot was set to the stellar effective temperature in Table

the posterior distributions of the modeled amplitudes hmodel are represented by orange hexagons which are spread horizontally to easily discern each passband. Only in the case of EPIC 210721261 does the posterior distribution in the K p band deviate significantly from the observed value. The other targets show good agreement for all passbands. The uncertainties with respect to the estimated sizes and temperatures are relatively large because the statistical error in h derived from the photometry is large. For all targets, we can see elongated posteriors in Figure 8 as a result of the degeneracy in the starspot size and temperature.
To take into account the case that the photospheric temperatures were mis-determined due to their young active natures, we performed additional analyses assuming ±200 K

differences on the Tphot. The results are also listed in Table 3 ; there are no significant deviations from the fiducial values. Therefore, our conclusions on the Tspot are not likely severely affected by the uncertainties in the photospheric temperature. We note that our modeling cannot solve degeneracies about the starspot size if large polar spots and/or axissymmetrically distributed spots exist on the photosphere, because they do not appear in the one-dimensional light curves.
5. DISCUSSION & SUMMARY
5.1. Wavelength Dependence of RV Jitter
We estimated the amplitudes of the flux modulations due to stellar surface activity for the four targets in the Hyades cluster, and constrained the starspot sizes and temperatures

using a simple toy model. For EPIC 210721261, the model in the K p band deviates from the observed amplitude, likely as a result of the particularly enhanced activity of the star when the K2 observations were made. EPIC 210721261 is the only target, whose possibility of binarity is significantly low based on the works of Evans (2018) with the Gaia DR2 data; for the other targets, it is possible that the starspot contrasts versus the wavelength are diluted by the presence of a companion. However, the Gaia EDR3 data (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2020) suggest binarity only for EPIC 247122957. In addition, because we assumed only cool starspots as elements of the surface activity, as opposed to plages, flares, or hot starspots, our model may differ significantly from the true stellar photosphere. In either case, the reduction rate of the photometric variations between the K p and H bands (1 - hH/hKp) is approximately 0.6 at maximum.
To predict RV jitter in the observing bandpasses, we approximated the maximum amplitudes as h×Veq (Aigrain et al. 2012) when the starspot is on the equator and the rotational inclination is 90, where Veq is the equatorial rotational velocity; these approximations are listed in Table 4. Consequently, we found that RV jitter in the NIR is significantly suppressed compared to jitter in visible wavelengths and that

there is no significant difference between the J, H, and Ks passbands.
5.2. Comparison with Previous Studies of the Starspot Property
Frasca et al. (2009) measured the starspot properties of six cool stars whose photometric variations are typically magH  0.1 ( 10% in relative flux) in the pre-mainsequence phase ( 10 Myr) using the simultaneous multicolor photometry in the R, I, J, and H bands. They derived the starspot size S and the temperature ratio between the starspot and the photosphere Tspot/Tphot to be 5% - 10% and 0.70 - 0.90, respectively. Our estimations are 8%- 18% and 0.93 - 0.96, respectively, for 650-Myr cool stars. Even though the sizes depend on the selection biases of the targets, these results may suggest that the temperature difference between starspot and the photosphere becomes smaller with stellar age.
In some previous studies, the starspot to photosphere temperature ratio Tspot/Tphot was estimated to be approximately 0.8 for G and K -type stars according to line-depth ratio measurements, which are currently believed to be the most reliable method to characterize the properties of starspots (e.g., Catalano et al. 2002; Frasca et al. 2008). In addition, O'Neal et al. (1996) and Frasca et al. (2008) suggested that T = Tspot - Tphot increases with surface gravity of the star, which may be explained by the balance of magnetic and gas pressures in flux tubes. However, our estimation appears to be systematically inconsistent with their theory considering the high surface gravity of our targets in Table 1. In addition, from results found in different models, Berdyugina (2005) and Strassmeier (2009) showed that T gets smaller for cooler stars by as much as 200 K. We plot the previous T estimations from Berdyugina (2005); Frasca et al. (2008, 2009) in the left panel of Figure 10. Our results with the red

points seem to follow this trend, although the derived values of T are estimated to be slightly small. Note that previous estimations of M dwarfs were derived using single-band light curve modeling (e.g., Rodono et al. 1986), which includes degeneracy between the starspot temperature and size. In addition, the samples used include large systematic uncertainties associated with the stellar evolution stage. In the right panel of Figure 10, we also show T with respect to the Rossby number which is related to the magnetic activity in stellar dynamo (Kim & Demarque 1996) and is approximated as Ro = v/(2L); v, , and L are surface velocity, angular velocity, and typical length, respectively. Here, we use the square root of the spot area for L, and macroturbulence velocity for v, which is calculated assuming that v linearly depends on the photospheric temperature in the range of 3000 < Tphot < 4500 K and 1 < v < 2 kms-1, respectively. T for our targets are significantly lower than the previous estimations for pre-main-sequence stars and the systematic trend with Ro is unclear. In any case, additional investigations are required for further relevant discussions.
5.3. Model Uncertainty
In Figure 11, we plot the theoretical semi-amplitude (hKp and hH) with setting S to 1.0 in the left panel and the corresponding contrast (hKp/hH) in the right panel as a function of the temperature ratio Tspot/Tphot in cases where the photospheric temperature is either 4000 K or 3000 K with the PHOENIX model spectra. The gray lines represent the values for EPIC 210923016 (3428 K) and EPIC 247783757 (3443 K), respecctively, whose contrasts are relatively small in our targets. This contrast figure suggests that as the starspot temperature asymptotically approaches the surface temperature, the contrasts between the starspot and the photosphere for the optical and NIR passbands become larger. Therefore, the starspots need to be hot at the same level as

the photosphere to explain our observational results. Nevertheless, the observed contrasts are still larger than the theoretical model expectations for EPIC 210721261, EPIC 210923016, and EPIC 247122957. Note that contrasts for EPIC 210721261 and EPIC 247122957 are beyond the range of the figure. This discrepancy is preferable for the detection of true planetary signals via NIR observations, albeit the reason for this may stem from the incompleteness of the models.
We also estimated the amplitude variation ratio between the H and K p bands due to an unresolved cool companion. We calculated fluxes ( fhost, fcomp) with the PHOENIX model spectra and derived the radii (rhost, rcomp) with a temperatureradius relationship in Mann et al. (2015) for the host and the companion, respectively. The signal dilution d due to the

companion is derived as,

2 . 

The contrast between the bands is estimated as dKp/dH and shown in Figure 12. The maximum variation is approxi-
mately 15% which is significantly smaller than the variation
due to the starspot. For example, the starspot temperature would be 3330+-140902 K for EPIC 247122957, even after the consideration of the 15% amplitude decrease in K p band. Therefore, our conclusions are not affected seriously even though the targets are binaries.

5.4. Advantage of This Study
Previous studies on starspots were performed for bright targets whose high-resolution spectra are available (Catalano et al. 2002) or whose photometric variations are sufficiently large ( 10%), such as pre-main-sequence stars (Frasca et al. 2009). Our approach, which combines space telescope and ground-based photometry, is applicable to a larger sample of targets with relatively small variations ( 1%). Even though the simple modeling to the multicolor photometry still includes degeneracies on geometry of the starspots, it is useful for investigating the macro temperature structure on the stellar surface. Because the K2 and T ES S missions collected and are collecting many light curves of young stars belonging to various stellar clusters, a similar approach to that presented here could reveal the statistical properties of stellar activities at different ages.
Finally, we suggest that the mitigation of RV jitter in the NIR could be more significant than expected from theoretical models, even though further observations with a larger

Photometric Variations of Young Cool Stars

sample are required to corroborate this possibility. To take advantage of NIR spectroscopy in Doppler observations, new NIR high-resolution spectrographs have been developed over the last decade, such as CARMENES at the Calar Alto 3.5m telescope (Quirrenbach et al. 2016), the Habitable-Zone Planet Finder (Mahadevan et al. 2014) on the Hobby Eberly Telescope, SPIRou on the CFHT 3.58-m telescope (Artigau et al. 2014), and the InfraRed Doppler spectrograph on the Subaru 8.2-m (Tamura et al. 2012; Kotani et al. 2014, 2018). Our results support the effectiveness of these NIR observations. In the near future, more accurate estimations of the properties of planetary systems around young stars will be possible by combining photometric and spectroscopic NIR observations, which will offer important clues understanding the formation and evolution processes of exoplanetary systems.

APPENDIX

A. GP REGRESSION

Gaussian Process (GP) is a non-parametric regression technique to analyze observed data having n points. It models an n × n covariance matrix, that expresses the correlation between the data points using kernel functions. In this study, we used the "squared exponential" kernel, "periodic" kernel and "quasi-periodic" kernel, as used in, e.g., Grunblatt et al. (2015) as follows:

 Ksq = h2 exp  -

2 ,

(A3)

where t is the data point of time, h is the covariance amplitude,  is the covariance length scale,  is the period of the variation, and w is the smoothing parameter of the periodicity for each kernel. The squared-exponential kernel expressed by Equation (A1) reproduces the continuous data points in the observed signals, and is often used for estimations of and/or corrections to systematic errors. Equation (A2) is the periodic kernel, which is used to flexibly model periodic signals including non-sinusoidal variations. The quasi-periodic kernel consisting of periodic and squared-exponential components (Equation (A3)) is often used to model quasi-periodic signals, including coherent modes such as stellar jitter.
We optimized the hyperparameters of the kernels by maximizing the likelihood L. Under the assumption that L follows an n-dimensional Gaussian distribution, the logarithmic likelihood is described with observed data points y as

log L = - n log(2) - 1 log(|K + 2I|)

2

2

- 1 yT · (K + 2I)-1 · y, 2

where I represents the identity matrix, y is the vector of the residuals of y from the mean, and  is white noise, which represents

the statistical uncertainty of each data point. In the maximization, we optimized the white noise component by including the
internal uncertainty of the observed data point (internal; i.e., photon noise) as  = (2internal + 2white)1/2. We performed the MCMC analysis provided by the Python package emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) to maximize the likelihood.

B. SUMMARY OF THE 19 TARGETS IN K2
Here, we summarize the properties of the 19 targets in Section 4.1. The effective temperature derived in Huber et al. (2016), the rotation period with GLS (Zechmeister & Ku¨rster 2009), and the hyperparameters of the periodic kernel in GP are listed in Table 5. The results of the GP analysis for all the targets in both Campaign 04 & 13 are shown in Table 13.
