Abstract We study the top quark pair events production in pp collisions in the +jets channel at the LHC energy of s = 14 TeV for Standard Model as well as new physics processes. We explore the usage of semi-boosted topologies where the top quark decays into a boosted hadronic W -jet and an isolated b-jet and study their performance in the tt¯ events kinematic reconstruction. An efficiency increase is observed and the correlation of selected kinematic variables between the detector and particle level is studied. Quality of the reconstructed mass line shape of a Z model with applications in current LHC experiments is evaluated. The results of the unfolding procedure for chosen spectra and an explicit proof of a slight degradation in the signal significance after the unfolding procedure are presented using the Fully Bayesian unfolding technique.

1 Introduction
This work studies the top quark reconstruction in an ATLAS-like detector simulation close to the real experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The LHC, the largest circular collider in the world at the time, collides protons at four interaction points where the detectors are located. The largest experiment at LHC is the ATLAS experiment, which is a multipurpose particle detector with ability to discern all kinds of elementary particles with the exception of neutrinos.
Quarks originating in a collision are not detected directly as they hadronize or in case of the top quark, decay before their arrival to the detector. The process of hadronization forms showers of particles from quarks as they proceed to the detector and the produced particles are collimated in the direction of the original particle. The degree of collimation is proportional to the momentum of the decaying particle or particles from the hadronization process, and this influences perpetual position of showers in the detector. If quarks have large momentum with respect to the beam, the corresponding particle showers are more collimated and even those from different original partons can overlap and be reconstructed as a single final state, a jet.
The energy of particles used in colliders increases with the advance of the experimental technology. This leads to the enrichment of events with particles of higher energies. This paper is studying the process of top anti-top pair production pp  tt¯ at the LHC at CERN at the center of mass energy s = 14 TeV. This paper also considers a process with a hypothetical massive vector particle Z as a mediator for the process pp  Z  tt¯ for the enhancement of events in areas of interest.
The tt¯ events are categorized into three channels, according to the decaying products of the top quarks. The top quark decay is described by the following process: t  W +q (q = b, s, d). The remainder of allowed decay processes are weak neutral currents which are heavily suppressed and their contribution is negligible. Furthermore, the decay of the top quark is mainly to the bottom quark thanks to the large difference between the value of the CKM mixing matrix element for bottom and light quarks (s, d). The W boson has two main decay modes; hadronic (68%) and leptonic (32%) [1]. There are two W boson decays in each tt¯ event and the tt¯ decay channels can be separated according to the combination of W decay modes to all-hadronic, semi-leptonic and dilepton channels. The analysis in this paper is focused on the semi-leptonic channel only.
The degree of collimation of the produced particle showers and their angular separation in the detector defines the topology of an event. In the resolved topology, tt¯ decay products are reconstructed as individual jets and a lepton, see Fig. 1 a). Events in this topology are usually produced at lower invariant masses of the tt¯ pair. In the semi-boosted topology, decay products on the side where the W boson is decaying hadronically are collimated enough to form one jet in the detector with exception of the jet from the b quark, see Fig. 1 b). In the semi-boosted mixed topology, which is a special case of semi-boosted topology, the angularly isolated jet is one of the W boson hadronic decay products instead from the top quark decay, see Fig. 1 c). In the boosted topology, all products from the hadronically decaying top quark are collimated and form one jet in the detector, see Fig. 1 d). The difference between the topologies is correlated to the energy spectrum of the tt¯ pair forming a gradual transition from the resolved to boosted topologies. The number of events of the resolved topology drops significantly with increasing energy of the process. In an intermediate energy regime, the number of events in the boosted topology is not yet large enough to fill the transition region of the tt¯ energy spectrum between those two topologies. Finding ways to improve the events reconstruction efficiency by adding the semi-boosted topologies, which reside in the aforementioned transition energy region, is one of the main aims of this paper.

can help gain statistics in tt¯ analyses. All these four topologies mentioned are explored in this paper.
2 Samples
Events were generated for the processes pp  tt¯ (SM) and pp  Z  tt¯ with the addition of a Z boson to the Standard Model [2, 3, 4] using the MadGraph5 version 2.6.4 simulation toolkit [5]. The parton showering and the hadronization process were simulated using Pythia8 [6]. Masses of the hypothetical Z particle, serving effectively as a source of semi-boosted and boosted top quarks, were selected as 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 and 1000 GeV to sample through the region where the number of events in the resolved topology starts to decline rapidly (500 GeV) while the number of the boosted topology events is becoming dominant (1000 GeV).
The tt¯-sample without the hypothetical Z particle ensures the correspondence with data measured with the ATLAS detector and is used as a background and for corrections for the unfolding procedure. The top quark mass in a simulation was set to 173 GeV.
The ATLAS detector was simulated using the Delphes version 3.4.1 package [7] with a modified ATLAS card1 jets with two distance parameters 0.4 and 1.0 were reconstructed using the anti-kt algorithm to form small-R jets (small jets) and large-R jets (large jets), using the FastJet algorithm [8].
The samples for the description of the W + jets and W W + jets backgrounds were prepared within the same framework as the signal samples. To ensure the strength of the evidence from the contribution of different samples, all samples were weighted to the same luminosity ( 12 fb-1) for stacking and unfolding purposes, which corresponds to the luminosity of the tt¯ sample.
The cross-sections of the samples used are summarized in Table 1. The numbers of events in the table are presented for one statistically independent sample and the generated samples also include charge conjugated processes in the decay, i.e. the top and anti-top quark decays were swapped.
1The modification is the addition of information about B-hadrons.

3 Object and event selection
Events considered in the analysis are reconstructed at two levels; once with the Delphes ATLAS detector simulation, forming detector level spectra and at the particle level. The selection and the requirements differ slightly for the reconstruction level and for the boosted, semi-boosted, semi-boosted mixed and resolved topologies.
3.1 Missing transverse energy requirement
The missing transverse energy (ET,miss) is a measure of energy imbalance in the plane transverse to the beam and is equal to the value of negative vector sum of energy of all objects in the transverse plane. By definition this should equal to zero thanks to the law of energy conservation, but the energy taken away by the undetected neutrinos is not counted for in the detector. The value of the missing transverse energy is required to be ET,miss > 25 GeV for all topologies as well as for both the detector and the particle levels. This ensures that only events in which neutrinos carry away a considerable amount of energy from the decay are chosen for the analysis. This is a standard requirement for the missing energy in most of top quark analyses.
3.2 Lepton selection
The second condition in the selection order is the requirement on the lepton (muon or electron) transverse momentum, namely pT,e/µ > 25 GeV. Similar value is also commonly used in top quark analyses. Tau leptons are not considered in the simulation as they decay before they enter the detector. In case there are more electrons or muons fulfilling this requirement, only the electron or muon with the highest transverse momentum is taken into account. This requirement is the same for all topologies. Events are separated to an electron or a muon channel by the flavor of the lepton. The lepton may radiate low energy photons which are highly collimated. The separation of those radiated photons and the lepton is below the resolution of the detector and photon energy is added by construction at the detector level. The lepton dressing procedure is performed at the particle level reconstruction to correct for this phenomenon. Photon four-vectors, fulfilling the condition of the angular separation threshold R, = 2, + 2, < 0.1, are added to the lepton four-vector.
3.3 Large jet selection
Jets are the experimental signatures of hadronic final states of quarks and gluons, which form particle showers entering the detector and leaving their energy there. Jet constituents are clustered energy deposits in calorimeters or stable particles at the particle level. The jet four-vector is the result of the reconstruction with the anti-kt algorithm with a distance parameter R = 1. The jet energy scale correction is applied to the detector level large jet before the selection, derived on the tt¯ sample. The magnitude of the jet energy scale correction is about 5%. The transverse momentum of large jets is required to be pT,LJ > 100 GeV. This condition helps to reduce the number of events with jets not coming from top quark decays. Furthermore, all large jets are considered in the pseudorapidity range |y| < 2.5. This constraint ensures in practice better jet identification as the forward region of the detector is not instrumented for tracking and has a worse energy resolution. The isolation criterion of jets from the lepton ensures that the selected lepton is

The large jets in the red dotted area are selected for the reconstruction of the boosted W boson and top quark. The mass window is set around the expected mass values equal to the W boson and top quark mass, respectively.
not contained within the large jet, thus the following requirement RLJ, = L2J, + 2LJ, > 1 must be fulfilled to avoid the aforementioned situation. All these requirements are applied to all three topologies2 and both the detector and the particle levels. Each large jet is then probed for the top quark and W boson tagging, first for the hypothesis as coming from the top quark decay, then, in the semi-boosted topology, as coming from the W boson decay and in case none of the tagging was successful, the event is then considered as a candidate for the semi-boosted mixed or the resolved topology. The large jet in the semi-boosted topology can be tagged as coming from the W boson, but there is no expected peak in the large jet mass spectrum in the semi-boosted mixed topology, and thus it cannot be tagged this way.
Tagging for the boosted topology is based on the constraint on the mass of the large jet 110 GeV< MLJ < 240 GeV and a constraint combining the large jet mass and a jet substructure variable 3,2 [9], describing the possibility of finding three small jets inside the studied large jets rather than two small jets, as MLJ/3,2 > 256 GeV. The value for the second constraint was added to avoid background events, e.g. a large jet from the W boson. The selection is depicted in Fig. 2 (right) by the area inside the red dotted lines.
Tagging of large jets for the semi-boosted topology is based on the large jet mass window 60 < MLJ < 120 GeV and the jet substructure variable 2,1, describing the possibility of finding two small jets inside the studied large jets rather than one small jet, 2,1 < 0.5. The selection is shown in Fig. 2 (left).
The case of the semi-boosted mixed topology, where the escaping small jet does not originate from the b quark but from a light quark is also considered. There is one more requirement on the large jet to contain a small jet originating from the b quark decay. This requirement is ensured by fulfilling the condition RLJ,SJ = L2J,SJ + 2LJ,SJ < 0.5 on the detector level, see Section 3.4 for further information about small jets. A similar condition is set at the particle level for the large jet to contain a B-hadron within RLJ,B-had < 0.5.
2There is no large jet in the resolved topology.

3.4 Small jets selection
The general requirements for a small jet selection are on the transverse momentum pT > 25 GeV and the isolation from the chosen lepton RSJ, > 0.5. The jet energy scale correction is applied on the detector level small jet objects before the selection, which was derived on the tt¯ sample on top of the Delphes default jet energy scale. The magnitude of this residual jet energy scale correction is about 2%. The b-tagging of the small jets is done by the Delphes simulation at the detector level and by the requirement of containing a B-hadron at the particle level by fulfilling the requirement of RSJ,B-had < 0.2.
3.4.1 Small jet for the reconstruction of the leptonically decaying top quark
The small jet selected for the reconstruction of the leptonically decaying top quark has to fulfill the angular condition RSJ, < 2, which ensures that the small jet lies in the vicinity of the selected lepton, and must be b-tagged. The large jet isolation condition RSJ,LJ > 1.5 applies to all topologies with the exception of the resolved topology, where there is no large jet entering the kinematic reconstruction. Such a selected small jet is then removed from the jet collection and from further consideration. This is the only selected small jet in case of the boosted topology.
3.4.2 Small jet for the hadronically decaying top quark, semi-boosted topology
For the reconstruction of the hadronically decaying top quark in the semi-boosted topology a small b-tagged jet is required with the vicinity condition to the selected large jet 1 < RSJ,LJ < 1.5. Thus a partial overlap between the selected large jet and the considered small jet is allowed, i.e. the selected b-tagged small jet can be partially contained in the selected large jet.
3.4.3 Small jet for the hadronically decaying top quark, semi-boosted mixed topology
The conditions for the semi-boosted mixed topology are very similar to the conditions for the semi-boosted topology. The vicinity condition to the large jet remains unchanged but the small jet is required to not be b-tagged. This condition together with the b-tag of the selected large jet ensures the correct selection for this topology.
3.4.4 Small jet for the hadronically decaying top quark, resolved topology
The resolved topology selection is tried as the last option before the event is discarded. The reconstruction of the hadronically decaying top quark in the resolved topology requires three small jets and one of them b-tagged. The algorithm first takes two small non-b-tagged jets with the highest transverse momentum and tests their invariant mass MSJ,SJ < 120 GeV to avoid dijets not corresponding to the mass of the W boson. Then it adds the four-vector of the remaining b-tagged jet3. If all three jets are found, the event is accepted.
4 Reconstruction
The events passing the selection described in the previous chapter are entering the top anti-top quark pair four-vector reconstruction described in this chapter and illustrated on the sample with

The vertical dashed lines indicate the position of the maximum value in the spectrum for each of the topologies, respectively, which is in the same bin for all topologies in this case.

MZ = 700 GeV, although all samples were processed the same way.
4.1 Leptonically decaying top quark
The reconstruction of the leptonically decaying top quark is the same for all three topologies starting with setting the transverse momentum of the neutrino (pT,) with the missing transverse energy ET,miss. The missing energy together with the four-vector of the selected lepton is used to calculate the longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum from the W boson mass constraint MW = M , which leads to a quadratic equation with two solutions for the neutrino longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum (pz,) in general. The solution which leads to the more central neutrino in the rapidity is accepted in the reconstruction. If the solution leads to a complex number result, the imaginary part is discarded. This procedure is often used in other top quark analyses in the ATLAS experiment [10]. The W boson is reconstructed as the sum of four-vectors of the lepton and the reconstructed neutrino. The top quark four-vector is reconstructed from the reconstructed W boson four-vector and the selected b-tagged small jet as described in Section 3.4.1. The mass of the reconstructed leptonically decaying top quark in the studied topologies is shown in Fig. 3 for both the detector and the particles levels.
4.2 Hadronically decaying top quark, boosted topology
The recognition of the boosted event is done by selecting a large jet fulfilling conditions specified in Section 3.3. There is no reconstructed W boson, thus the tagged large jet is considered as the sum of all products coming from the top quark decay. The mass of the large jet corresponding to the reconstructed hadronically decaying top quark is shown in Fig. 4 at the detector (bottom right) and the particle levels (bottom left).

4.3 Hadronically decaying top quark, semi-boosted topology
The reconstruction of the hadronically decaying top quark in the semi-boosted topology uses the selected W -tagged large jet and one small b-tagged jet, fulfilling the conditions mentioned in Section 3.4.2. The tagged large jet is considered as the hadronically decaying W boson, with its mass shown in Fig. 4 at the detector (top right) and the particle levels (top left). The reconstructed top quark is formed by adding the selected b-tagged small jet four-vector. Its mass is shown in Fig. 4 at the detector (bottom right) and the particle (bottom left) levels.
4.4 Hadronically decaying top quark, semi-boosted mixed topology
The reconstruction of the hadronically decaying top quark in the semi-boosted mixed topology is reconstructed by summing one large jet and one non-b-tagged small jet four-vectors, see Section 3.4.3 for details. The invariant mass of the large jet does not correspond to the mass of any particle, but in the combination with the selected small jet the invariant mass should correspond to the mass of the top quark. The reconstructed mass of the hadronically decaying top quark is shown in Fig. 4 at the detector (bottom right) and the particle (bottom left) levels.
4.5 Hadronically decaying top quark, resolved topology
The resolved topology has the largest combinatorial background as it involves largest multiplicity of objects for the reconstruction. The first step of the reconstruction is the W boson reconstruction from two small jets, which are not tagged as b-jets. Mass of the reconstructed hadronically decaying W boson is shown in Fig. 4 at the detector (top right) and the particle levels (top left). The third selected small jet for the reconstruction in the resolved topology, which is tagged as the b-jet, is then added to the reconstructed W boson forming the four-vector of the hadronically decaying top quark. The mass of the reconstructed hadronically decaying top quark is shown in Fig. 4 (bottom) at both the detector and the particle levels.
4.6 Top anti-top quark pair system
The four-vector of the top anti-top quark pair system is reconstructed as the combination of the leptonically and hadronically decaying top quarks. The reconstructed tt¯ system mass and the contribution fractions of events from the particular topologies are shown in Fig. 5. The fractions depend on the mass of the hypothetical Z particle as is shown in Fig. 6. This plot illustrates the existence of the transition region between the resolved and the boosted topology which was mentioned in Section 1 in terms of the semi-boosted and semi-boosted mixed topologies and their non-negligible fractions.
The event yields for each sample is presented in Table 2 at the detector and particle levels.
4.7 Migration of reconstructed events between topologies
The reconstruction of events at the detector and particle levels is accomplished in parallel under the same selection conditions with the exception of the b-tagging, but the event topologies are necessarily not the same at the two reconstruction levels. This phenomenon is described by the migration matrix between the levels and the topologies in Fig. 7 (left). Similar migration applies to any studied variable and the example for the reconstructed top anti-top quark pair transverse

momentum (pT,t¯t) is shown in Fig. 7 (right). The matching condition, requiring the same topology at the detector and particle level, is applied for the purpose of unfolding and only those events are taken into account to study migration between variables used in the unfolding procedure.
5 Results
The results are summarized in this section consisting of the resolution of different samples, the performance of the unfolding process for selected variables in dedicated stacked samples and the significance studies of the Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) signal over the Standard Model background.
5.1 Resolution studies
The reconstructed tt¯ mass (Mt¯t) spectrum distribution is peaking around the value of the mass of the studied hypothetical particle Z by the definition of the studied simulated process. The width of this distribution is measure of the resolution of the reconstruction in given topology. The Gaussian curve was used to determine the width of the reconstructed distribution at both the detector and the particle levels and is shown in Fig. 8 in absolute values (top) and relative values (bottom) when divided by the MZ of the corresponding sample.
The resolution is comparable between all the topologies with the exception for the semi-boosted mixed topology at the detector level where the resolution is slightly worse, being approximately 15% while the resolution of the other topologies is between 9­13%.
5.2 The unfolding procedure and significance tests
The unfolding procedure corrects for the influences of the detector in the measured detector level spectra. The Fully Bayesian Unfolding (FBU) [11] was chosen for the purposes of this procedure implemented with the PyMC3 package [12]. In short, FBU is using Bayesian theorem to estimate

the truth spectrum from the measured detector level spectrum with the known migration matrix and returns a probability density function in each bin. The maximum of the function is chosen as the truth level estimate for the specific bin. Among the main advantages of this method are that the migration matrix is not modified as in the singular value decomposition [13], absence of iterations in calculation in comparison with iterative unfolding [14], which also uses the Bayesian theorem, and the control over the result as all extremes of the probability density function are revealed and not only the one to which the procedure converges as in iterative Bayesian unfolding. A general unfolding process is described by the following formula

T^i

=

1 fi,eff

Mi-j 1fj,acc(Dj

- Bj),

(1)

where T^i is the estimate of the particle level spectrum in bin i, fi,eff is the efficiency correction, Mi-j 1 stands for the main unfolding procedure using the migration matrix4 Mij, fj,acc is the acceptance
correction in detector level bin j, Dj is the measured detector level spectrum and Bj is the estimated
background. The efficiency and acceptance correction factors are defined as

fi,eff

=

Ptm¯t,ai tch Pt¯t,i

and

fj,acc

=

Dtm¯t,ajtch , Dt¯t,j

(2)

where Pt¯t,i is the particle level spectrum in bin i using the tt¯ sample, while Ptm¯t,ai tch is the particle level spectrum in bin i for events matched to the detector level events, evaluated using the tt¯sample,
i.e. only events reconstructed at both particle and detector levels in the same topology contribute to this spectrum. Similarly Dt¯t,j is the detector level spectrum in bin j and Dtm¯t,ajtch is the detector level spectrum in bin j for events matched to the particle level. Both correction factors are in the
range between 0 and 1 by definition. The corrections for the unfolding procedure were prepared using a statistically independent tt¯ sample.
The spectra entering the unfolding procedure have the addition of the Z signal sample with an amplified cross section by an ad hoc number of 105 to study the impact of the unfolding on the
strength of a well-present signal.

5.3 Unfolding selected spectra in the semi-boosted topology
Unfolding of two selected spectra is described in this section, the transverse momentum of the hadronically decaying top quark (ptT,had) and the invariant mass of the reconstructed top anti-top quark pair (Mt¯t), both reconstructed in the semi-boosted topology. The addition of the associated production of one W boson and two b quarks (W bb  bb + jets) background and two W bosons and two b quarks (W W bb  bb + jets) background and the addition of a sample with MZ = 700 GeV brings the analysis close to the one over the real data sample.
The comparison between the stacked histograms of the transverse momentum of the hadronically decaying top quark in the semi-boosted topology and its counterpart from the statistically independent sample is shown in Fig. 9 (left). The histogram and the stacked spectra agree well, their difference is within the statistical uncertainties. The spectrum described by the black markers is taken as the input pseudo-data for the unfolding procedure. The binning was selected so that the unfolding proceeds fast enough but still delivers information about spectra shape.
4Fully Bayesian Unfolding does not use the inverted migration matrix for the estimation of the particle level spectra, the notation in the formula stands for a shorthand of the unfolding procedure in general.

Figure 9: Comparison of the detector level spectra from two statistically independent parts (full markers and filled stack) for the tt¯ sample with the addition of W bb and W W bb backgrounds and
an admixture of events from the sample with MZ = 700 GeV for the transverse momentum of the hadronically decaying top quark (ptT,had) (left) and for the top anti-top quark pair invariant mass (Mt¯t) (right) in the semi-boosted topology. The hatched bands in the top plot represent the statistical uncertainty in each sample.

The tt¯ system invariant mass spectrum was chosen due to the possibility to see the hints of events from the sample with the hypothetical particle Z . The spectrum entering the unfolding procedure and its statistically independent counterpart is shown in Fig. 9 (right).
The corrections used in the unfolding procedure were taken from the statistically independent counterparts of the tt¯ sample. The corresponding acceptance and efficiency corrections are shown in Fig. 10 and the corresponding migration matrices are presented in Fig. 11. The unfolding results for the two spectra are shown in Fig. 12.

5.4 Significance at the detector and unfolded levels
The strength of the Z signal is quantified by the significance which considers statistical uncertainties of samples used in given bin. The significance S in bin i before unfolding is defined as

Si,det  (Pitt¯+Z +B - Titt¯ - Bi,1 - ... - Bi,k)/ P2i + T2i ,

(3)

where Pi are the pseudo data consisting from the signal and the background added to the expected tt¯ sample in bin i, Ti is the detector level spectrum from the statistically independent tt¯ sample and
Bi,k is the background contribution to the studied spectra from the k-th background sample, Pi is the statistical uncertainty of the pseudo data sample and Ti is the statistical uncertainty in the statistically independent tt¯ sample at the detector level. The composition of the sample is denoted

Figure 12: The comparison between the unfolded spectrum (black full markers), the detector level
spectrum (blue) with the acceptance and efficiency correction applied for comparison purposes and the tt¯-only particle level spectrum (red) for the transverse momentum of the hadronically decaying top quark (ptT,had) in the semi-boosted topology (left) and the invariant mass of the reconstructed tt¯ spectrum (Mt¯t, right). The 2t¯t test is performed between the unfolded and tt¯ particle level spectra and 2t¯t+Z between the unfolded while tt¯ particle level spectra with the Z signal (closure test). The middle plots show the ratio of the unfolded spectrum over the particle level spectrum from the tt¯ sample (black full markers), the disagreement with the tt¯-only particle level spectrum is caused
by the addition of Z sample before unfolding. The yellow band shows the statistical uncertainty in the particle level spectrum from the tt¯ sample. The bottom plots show the detector (open
markers, dashed line) and unfolded (full markers, solid line) significances in each bin. The detector
significance is calculated without applying the acceptance and efficiency correction, therefore, it is
not calculated from the detector level spectra in the top part of the figure.

A similar significance is defined after the unfolding procedure

where Ui are the unfolded data in the given bin, Ti is the particle level spectrum from the statistically independent tt¯ sample, Ui is the statistical uncertainty of the unfolded spectra in bin i and Ti is the statistical uncertainty in the statistically independent tt¯ sample.

The detector and the unfolded significance plots are shown under the ratio plots of the unfolded

spectra in Fig. 12. The integral significance, strength of the signal over the whole spectrum, is

defined similarly for both the detector and the unfolded level. The detector level integral significance

is defined as

m

(P2i + T2i ),

where m is number of bins in the given spectrum. The detector level integral significance is the same for all variables.
The integral significance at the unfolded level is defined as

SI,unf  (Uitt¯+Z - Titt¯)/

(U2 i + T2i ).

i=0

The unfolded integral significance varies slightly over spectra as in the unfolding procedure the integral of the spectrum is not preserved. The values of both the detector and the unfolded integral significance are presented in the legend in Fig. 13.
The significances were calculated for all combinations of spectra, topologies and levels. The comparison between significances before and after the unfolding procedure for the transverse momentum of the reconstructed hadronically decaying top quark (pTt,had) over topologies is shown in Fig. 13 (right) and for the invariant mass of the reconstructed tt¯ (Mt¯t) in Fig. 13 (left). The significance uncertainties were estimated by using 100 pseudo experiments for each spectrum with a smeared content in each bin. The smearing was performed by drawing a random number from the Gaussian distribution within the  parameter equal to the statistical uncertainty in the given bin and with the mean parameter set to zero. The resulting standard deviation of significances in each bin is considered as the statistical uncertainty in the unfolded significance. The spectrum was first smeared, then unfolded and finally studied for the dispersion and the significance uncertainty. The statistical uncertainty of the significances is already present in Fig. 13.

6 Conclusions
The results of the semi-boosted and semi-boosted mixed reconstruction algorithm show potential to enhance the number of events in the tt¯ analyses in the semi-leptonic decay channel. The estimates show the enrichment in events between 20% and 50% in the tt¯ pair mass region ranging from 500 GeV to 1000 GeV. The resolution in the semi-boosted topology and the resolved or boosted topology is comparable, only the semi-boosted mixed has a worse resolution roughly by

factor of 1.5. The performance of the unfolding procedure including a simple background model shows results corresponding well to the particle level and the significance of the enhanced signal of the hypothetical Z particle is still visible after the unfolding. Values of the detector and the unfolded integral significance are comparable, yet there is 20­30% decrease in significance between the detector and the unfolding levels caused by the unfolding in the reconstructed tt¯ mass spectrum and 5­20% in the reconstructed transverse momentum of the hadronically decaying top quark spectrum. The concrete proof of diminishing the significance by the unfolding procedure is, to our knowledge, shown explicitly for the first time in this study. The described algorithm proves that semi-boosted and semi-boosted mixed topologies are sensitive to the possible presence of BSM signals. The selection criteria chosen close to those in real analyses make the studied algorithms applicable also in current LHC experiments.
