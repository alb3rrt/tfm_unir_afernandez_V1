## Abstract

We consider electrodiffusion of ions in fluids, described by the Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes system, in three dimensional bounded domains, with blocking (no-flux) boundary conditions for the ionic concentrations and Robin boundary conditions for the electric potential, representing the presence of an electrical double layer. We prove global existence of strong solutions for arbitrary initial data in the case of two oppositely charged ionic species and also in the case of more than two species when the diffusivities are equal and the magnitudes of the valences are also equal. This result holds unconditionally in the case where fluid flow is described by the Stokes equations. In the case of Navier-Stokes coupling, the result holds conditionally on Navier-Stokes regularity. We also consider a case of mixed blocking-Dirichlet boundary conditions for the ionic concentrations and prove global regularity for two oppositely charged species when the total concentration of one species is sufficiently low.
