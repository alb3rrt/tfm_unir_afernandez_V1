## Abstract

The results presented in this paper fall into two categories: in the first part of the paper we are concerned with the computational aspects of finding a minimum harmonious coloring and in the second part we determine the exact value of the harmonious chromatic number for some particular graphs and classes of graphs. More precisely, in the first part we show that finding a minimum harmonious coloring for arbitrary graphs is APX-hard, the natural greedy algorithm is a $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$-approximation, and, moreover, we show a relationship between the vertex cover and the harmonious chromatic number. In the second part we determine the exact value of the harmonious chromatic number for all 3-regular planar graphs of diameter 3, some non-planar regular graphs and cycle-related graphs.
