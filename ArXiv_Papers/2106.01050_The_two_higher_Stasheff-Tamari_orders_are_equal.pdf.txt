THE TWO HIGHER STASHEFF­TAMARI ORDERS ARE EQUAL
NICHOLAS J. WILLIAMS
Abstract. The set of triangulations of a cyclic polytope possesses two a priori different partial orders, known as the higher Stasheff­Tamari orders. The first of these orders was introduced by Kapranov and Voevodsky, while the second order was introduced by Edelman and Reiner, who also conjectured the two to coincide in 1996. In this paper we prove their conjecture, thereby substantially increasing our understanding of these orders. This result also has ramifications in the representation theory of algebras, as established in previous work of the author. Indeed, it means that the two corresponding orders on tilting modules, cluster-tilting objects and their maximal chains are equal for the higher Auslander algebras of type A.

1. Introduction
One of the principal reasons to study triangulations is their ability to encode pertinent information combinatorially. One example here is the famous work of Gelfand, Kapranov, and Zelevinsky showing how extremal terms of A-discriminants are described by regular triangulations of Newton polytopes [GKZ94]. Another example is given by the result of Stanley that the linear extensions of a poset correspond to simplices in a triangulation of its order polytope [Sta86].
But nowhere is this ability in sharper relief than in the Tamari lattice [FT67; HT72; Tam51], a ubiquitous partial order encoded by triangulations of convex polygons. The Tamari lattice is inescapable when considering weak associativity conditions [Tam62], which are often of mathematical interest. Here triangulations of convex polygons correspond to the different possibilities for performing a binary operation on a string. Homotopy associativity of H-spaces in algebraic topology was studied by Stasheff [Sta63] using the associahedron, a polytope whose 1-skeleton is the Tamari lattice which was also originally considered by Tamari [Tam51; Sta12]. In mathematical physics, weak associativity conditions occur in open string field theory [Moo55; KK74; Hat+86], and in the Biedenharn­Elliott identities [Bie53; Ell53]. In algebra, triangulations of convex polygons correspond to clusters in the type A cluster algebra [FZ03], which is related to incarnations of the Tamari lattice as a partial order on tilting modules [BK04] or torsion classes [Tho12] for the type A path algebra. The sequence counting the number of objects of the Tamari lattice is the Catalan numbers, which is known to enumerate over two hundred different sequences of combinatorial objects [Sta15]. The extensive reach of the Tamari lattice into different areas of mathematics is exhibited in the Tamari memorial festschrift [MPS12].
The first and second higher Stasheff­Tamari orders are two higher-dimensional versions of the Tamari lattice. Their objects are triangulations of cyclic polytopes, which are the higher-dimensional analogues of triangulations of convex polygons. The history of these orders is as follows. In 1991, Kapranov and Voevodsky [KV91] defined an order on the set of triangulations of a cyclic polytope called the higher Stasheff order, as natural examples of strictly ordered n-categories produced by an iterative construction. In 1996, Edelman and Reiner built upon this work by introducing the two a priori different higher Stasheff­Tamari orders. Thomas later proved that the first higher Stasheff­Tamari order of Edelman and Reiner coincided with the higher Stasheff order of Kapranov and Voevodsky [Tho03]. Edelman and Reiner further conjectured the two higher Stasheff­Tamari orders to coincide with each other [ER96, Conjecture 2.6], a problem that has remained open since, despite several papers on the orders [ERR00; Tho02; Tho03; Ram97; RS00; RR].
One especially beautiful facet of the higher-dimensional orders is that triangulations of ( + 1)-dimensional cyclic polytopes are assembled from maximal chains of

triangulations of -dimensional cyclic polytopes in the first higher Stasheff­Tamari order [Ram97]. In particular, the objects of the three-dimensional first higher Stasheff­Tamari order correspond to equivalence classes of maximal chains in the Tamari lattice, and the objects of the four-dimensional first higher Stasheff­Tamari order correspond to equivalence classes of maximal chains in the three-dimensional order, and so on.
Generalisations of, and variations on, of the Tamari lattice is a large subject in itself, and includes Tamari lattices in other Dynkin types [Tho06], Cambrian lattices [Rea06], lattices of torsion classes of cluster-tilted algebras [GM19], m-Tamari lattices [BP12; BFP11], -Tamari lattices [PV17], Dyck lattices [Knu11; Dis+12], generalised Tamari orders [Ron12], and Grassmann­Tamari orders [SSW17]. However, the higher Stasheff­Tamari orders hold a particularly special position amongst these because, as we have seen, they encode higher-dimensional information hidden in the Tamari lattice itself, rather than being only variations of the Tamari lattice. This furthermore shows the virtues of viewing the Tamari lattice in terms of triangulations of convex polygons: it brings out these latent higher-dimensional structures which are obscured by other combinatorial interpretations.
Just as we have seen for triangulations of convex polygons, triangulations of cyclic polytopes describe phenomena across mathematics. Indeed, triangulations of cyclic polytopes are often used to define higher-dimensional analogues of structures that exist for lower-dimensional triangulations. The example of this par excellence is the application of triangulations of cyclic polytopes to define higher Segal spaces [DK19], see also [Pog17; DJW19]. In integrable systems, regular triangulations of cyclic polytopes describe the evolution of a class of solitary waves modelled by the Kadomtsev­Petviashvili equation [DM12; Wil20b], see also [Hua15; KK21; GPW19]. The amplituhedron of Arkani-Hamed and Trnka [AT14] is a cyclic polytope for particular values of its parameters. Here, repeatedly applying the BCFW recursion [Bri+05] to compute scattering amplitudes produces a triangulation of this cyclic polytope [BT18]. In algebra, triangulations of cylic polytopes correspond to tilting modules and equivalence classes of (d-)maximal green sequences for the higher Auslander algebras of type A [OT12; Wil20a]. Triangulations of cyclic polytopes have also been shown to be in bijection with other combinatorial objects, such as snug partitions [Tho02] and persistent graphs [FR21], and the higher Stasheff­Tamari orders can also be interpreted in these terms. A cyclic polytope is called an alternating polytope if all of its induced subpolytopes are cyclic; Sturmfels shows that alternating polytopes correspond naturally to totally positive matrices [Stu88b], which are of significant interest in both pure mathematics and applications [And87; Lus98; Pos06].
The two higher Stasheff­Tamari orders are quite different in nature and each has its own advantages. The first order is more combinatorial and is defined by means of

4

its covering relations, which are given by increasing bistellar flips. The second order is more geometric and was originally defined by comparing the heights of sections induced by triangulations. However, it was shown in [Tho02; Wil20a] how one may define the second order combinatorially. The second order allows direct comparison between triangulations, whereas comparing triangulations in the first order requires one to find a sequence of increasing bistellar flips. On the other hand, the local structure of the second poset is not clear, because the covering relations are not known. It is also easier to compute the entire first poset than to compute the entire second poset. Computing either poset requires computing all the triangulations of a given cyclic polytope. The most efficient algorithm for doing this is to start at the minimal triangulation and iteratively compute increasing bistellar flips [JK18], which is tantamount to computing the first order. To construct the second order then requires additional computations on top of this.
It is clear that whenever the first higher Stasheff­Tamari order holds between a pair of triangulations, then the second order must hold too, as was noted in [ER96]. This is because if a triangulation T  is an increasing bistellar flip of a triangulation T , then the section of T  certainly lies above the section of T . But it is not clear whether the first order should hold whenever the second one does. Indeed, an analogous result for the higher Bruhat orders has been known to be false since 1993 [Zie93]. A priori it might be possible for there to exist a pair of pathological triangulations T and T  where the section of T lay below the section of T , and yet T  could not be reached by a sequence of increasing bistellar flips from T .
In this paper, we prove the Edelman­Reiner conjecture that the first higher Stasheff­Tamari order ( 1) is equal to the second higher Stasheff­Tamari order ( 2).
Theorem 1.1 (Theorem 3.10 and Theorem 3.15). Let T and T  be triangulations of the cyclic polytope C(m, ). Then T 1 T  if and only if T 2 T .
This reveals the remarkable--and somewhat surprising--fact that in order for a sequence of increasing bistellar flips to exist from a triangulation T to a triangulation T , it suffices for the section of T  to lie above the section of T . This allows triangulations to be compared directly in the first order, and thus substantially increases the ease of working with this poset. An application of this result is that the orders considered in [Wil20a] on tilting modules and their maximal chains, and cluster-tilting objects and (d-)maximal green sequences coincide for the higher Auslander algebras of type A. This is an intriguing fact which raises the prospect that this might be true more generally in higher Auslander­Reiten theory. However, there are many obstacles to such a proof, principally, the lack of mutability present in higher Auslander­Reiten theory [OT12].

Our proof of the conjecture is inductive and combinatorial, drawing upon the results of [Wil20a]. The main difficulty in proving the conjecture is that as the dimension of the cyclic polytope grows, increasing bistellar flips become scarce. The key insight of the proof is that one can find increasing bistellar flips inductively by contracting triangulations, because when one reverses the contraction the small polytopes in which the flips occur remain small enough to find a new flip. The difficult step in the proof is then showing that the increasing bistellar flip one has found respects the second order, which allows one to build a chain of flips between the two sections. The details of this step differ between even and odd dimensions, and, accordingly, we deal with the proofs separately for the two different parities. Understanding how subpolytopes of triangulations behave under expansion requires extending the theory of contracting and expanding triangulations from [RS00, Lemma 4.7(i)] to arbitrary vertices, which is of independent interest. Indeed, this theory is extremely useful in proving new descriptions of triangulations of cyclic polytopes [Tho02; OT12; Wil20a].
This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we give background on the higher Stasheff­Tamari orders. In Section 3 we prove the Edelman­Reiner conjecture. At the beginning of this section we give an outline of our proof that the higher Stasheff­ Tamari orders are equal. After proving some preliminary lemmas, we split the proof of the conjecture into two cases, depending upon whether the cyclic polytope is odd-dimensional or even-dimensional. We finish this section by showing how one can deduce the result for even dimensions from the result for odd dimensions, and vice versa. In Section 4 we generalise the theory from [RS00, Lemma 4.7(i)] of contracting and expanding triangulations of cyclic polytopes to arbitrary vertices. This allows us to prove technical results which are needed for the proof in Section 3.

2. Background

We first declare some notation. We use [m] to denote the set {1, . . . , m}. Simi-

larly, we write [m, n] for { i  N : m i n } and call subsets of this form intervals.

By

[m] k

we mean the set of subsets of [m] of size k. When we display the elements

of a subset of [m], we shall always display the elements in order. Hence, if we write

S = {a, b, c, . . . , x, y, z}, we always mean that a < b < c < · · · < x < y < z. Fur-

thermore, if A 

[m] k+1

,

then,

unless

indicated

otherwise,

we

shall

find

it

convenient

to denote the elements of A by A = {a0, . . . , ak}. The same applies to other letters

of the alphabet: the upper-case letter denotes the subset; the lower-case letter is

used for the elements, which are ordered according to their index starting from 0.

In an effort to make the notation lighter, we often omit braces around sets, writing

A  x for A  {x} and A \ x for A \ {x}.

2.1. Cyclic polytopes and their triangulations. Our framework for cyclic polytopes and their triangulations maintains a sharp distinction between the combinatorial and the geometric.
2.1.1. Convex polytopes. A subset X  Rn is convex if for any x, x  X, the line segment connecting x and x is contained in X. The convex hull conv(X) of X is the smallest convex set containing X or, equivalently, the intersection of all convex sets containing X.
Let V  Z>0 be a finite set and | - | : V  R be an injective function, which we call the geometric realisation. We extend the notation to subsets of V by setting |A| = conv{ |a| : a  A }. We let P = |V | and suppose that the affine span of P is R. A subset P  R of this form is called a (geometric) convex polytope. Given V   V , we say that |V | is a subpolytope of |V |.
A face of a P is a subset on which some linear functional is maximised. That is, F  P is a face of P if there is a vector a  R such that
F = { x  P : a, x a, y , y  P },
where ` -, - ' denotes the standard inner product. A (geometric) facet of P is a face of codimension one. A (combinatorial) facet of P is a subset F  V such that |F | is a geometric facet of P. The set of faces of a polytope P forms a lattice under inclusion, which is known as the face lattice.
Let v  V be such that |v| is the face of P given by maximising a functional a, - . Further, let  > 0 be sufficiently small that, for all w  V \ v, we have that a, |w| < a, |v| - . The vertex figure of P at v is then the intersection
P\v := P  { x  R : a, x = a, |v| -  },
that is, the intersection of P with the hyperplane a, x = a, |v| - . A circuit of a polytope P realised geometrically via | - | : V  R is a pair,
(Z+, Z-), of disjoint subsets of V which are inclusion-minimal with the property that |Z+|  |Z-| = . In this case, |Z+| and |Z-| intersect in a unique point.
The facets and circuits of the polytope P realised geometrically via |-| : V  R comprise the combinatorial data that we are interested in. If we let FP and ZP be respectively the set of combinatorial facets of P and the set of combinatorial circuits of P, then we say that the triple P = (V, FP, ZP) is a combinatorial polytope.
Remark 2.1. Note that there might exist v  V such that |v| is not a face of P, since we may have |v|  |V \ v|. Allowing such elements of V is necessary for considering one-dimensional cyclic polytopes. Hence, strictly, the data we consider comprise a point configuration rather than a polytope.

2.1.2. Cyclic polytopes. Cyclic polytopes are the higher-dimensional analogues of convex polygons. General introductions to this class of polytopes can be found in [Zie95, Lecture 0] and [Gru¨03, Section 4.7]. Gru¨nbaum writes that the construction

of cyclic polytopes in current use is due to Gale [Gal63] and Klee [Kle63], and that they were introduced and studied in the 1950s by Gale [Gal55] and Motzkin [Mot57]. The earlier work of Carath´eodory [Car07; Car11] is related, but the convex bodies studied in these papers are not cyclic polytopes: they are the continuous analogues of even-dimensional cyclic polytopes.
The cyclic polytope C(V, ) is the polytope with geometric realisation
| - | : V  R v  |v| = p(tv) := (tv, t2v, . . . , tv),
where {tv0 , . . . , tvk }  R and k + 1 = #V . (Recall our convention that V = {v0, . . . , vk} and that by writing {tv0, . . . , tvk }, we indicate that tv0 < · · · < tvk .) When the dimension of the geometric realisation is clear from the context, we will drop the subscript and write | - | instead of | - |. In the case where V = [m], we write C(m, ) := C([m], ). The curve defined by p(t) := (t, t2, . . . , t)  R is called the moment curve.
The facets of C(m, ) come in two different types. A facet F of C(m, ) is an upper facet if for any a  R such that a, - is maximised on F, we have that a > 0, where a is the -th coordinate of a. Dually, a facet F of C(m, ,) is a lower facet if a is negative for any a such that F maximises a, - . Equivalently, a facet

8

F of C(m, ) is an upper (lower) facet if any normal vector to F which points out of the polytope has a positive (negative) -coordinate. Or, more informally, F is an upper (lower) facet if it can be seen from a very large positive (negative) -th coordinate.
Given a subset F  V , we say that an element v  V \ F is an even gap in F if #{ x  F : x > v } is even. Otherwise, it is an odd gap. A subset F  V is even if every v  V \ F is an even gap. A subset F  V is odd if every v  [m] \ F is an odd gap. Gale's Evenness Criterion [Gal63, Theorem 3][ER96, Lemma 2.3] states that, given a -subset F  V , we have that |F | is an upper facet of C(V, ) if and only if F is an odd subset, and that |F | is a lower facet of C(V, ) if and only if F is an even subset. We write
F l(V, ) := { F  V : |F | is a lower facet of |V | }, and F u(V, ) := { F  V : |F | is an upper facet of |V | }.
Following [OT12, Definition 2.2], if A, B  V are (d + 1)-subsets, then we say that A intertwines B, and write A  B, if

a0 < b0 < a1 < b1 < · · · < ad < bd.

If either A  B or B  A, then we say that A and B are intertwining. (That is, we use `are intertwining' to refer to the symmetric closure of the relation `intertwines'.) A collection of increasing (d + 1)-subsets is called non-intertwining if no pair of the elements are intertwining. Following [Wil20a], if A is a d-subset and B is a (d + 1)-subset, then we also say that A intertwines B, and write A  B, if

b0 < a0 < b1 < · · · < ad-1 < bd.

This

result

is

originally

due

to Breen [Bre73], but it is well-known due to description of the oriented matroid

given by a cyclic polytope [BL78; Stu88a; CD00].

These combinatorial characterisations of upper and lower facets and circuits

show that these notions are independent of the particular geometric realisation of

C(V, ). Hence, we will write F (V, ) for the combinatorial facets of C(V, ), Z(V, )

for the combinatorial circuits of C(V, ), and C(V, ) for the combinatorial cyclic

polytope consisting of the triple (V, F (V, ), Z(V, )). Facets of C(V, ) will also be

designated as either upper facets or lower facets, as dictated by Gale's Evenness

Criterion. As for geometric cyclic polytopes, we write C(m, ) := C([m], ). If

#V = m, then we say that C(V, ) and C(m, ) are congruent --they only differ by

the labels of the vertices.

Remark 2.2. In the literature, the term `cyclic polytope' is sometimes used more widely to refer to a geometric polytope which is combinatorially equivalent to a cyclic polytope C(m, ), where two polytopes are combinatorially equivalent if they

have isomorphic face lattices. Here we use the term `cyclic polytope' in the narrower sense in which we have defined it above: the convex hull of a set of points on the moment curve.
Another term that appears in the literature is `alternating polytope', which refers to a polytope P which is combinatorially equivalent to a cyclic polytope C(m, ) in such a way that this combinatorial equivalence restricts to a combinatorial equivalence between each of the corresponding subpolytopes of P and C(m, ). It is clear from the definitions that cyclic polytopes in our sense are also alternating polytopes in this sense. Indeed, when we consider subpolytopes of our cyclic polytopes, we will use the fact that these are cyclic polytopes under the vertex labelling induced from the larger polytope. Shemer proves that every polytope combinatorially equivalent to an even-dimensional cyclic polytope is an alternating polytope [She82], but this is known not to be true in general--see, for instance, [Stu88b]. See also [BK00].

2.1.3. Triangulations. We now explain our framework for triangulations. We maintain our set-up from Section 2.1.1, where V  Z>0 is a finite subset, with |- | : V  R a geometric realisation giving a geometric polytope P = |V |, with corresponding combinatorial polytope P = (V, FP, ZP).
A combinatorial -simplex in V is a ( + 1)-subset S  V . The k-faces of S are the subsets of S of size k + 1. We consider abstract simplicial complexes in terms of maximal simplices. Hence, an abstract simplicial complex is a set A of combinatorial simplices in [m] such that if S, S  A, then S  S. The k-simplices of A are the k-faces of elements of A. An abstract simplicial complex A is an abstract simplicial subcomplex of A if every simplex of A is a face of a simplex of A.
Given a ( + 1)-simplex S  V , if { |s| : s  S } is an affinely independent set, then |S| is a geometric -simplex. A collection G of geometric simplices is a geometric simplicial complex if
|S  R| = |S|  |R|
for all |S|, |R|  G, and if there exist no |S |R|  G such that |S| is a face of |R|. Geometric simplicial subcomplexes are defined analogously to abstract simplicial subcomplexes.
A (geometric) triangulation of the geometric polytope P is an geometric simplicial complex T such that P = |S|T |S|. A (combinatorial) triangulation of the combinatorial polytope P is an abstract simplicial complex T such that
· for all S  T and all facets F of S, we either have that F is contained in a facet of P , or there exists R  T \ {S} such that F  R,
· there is no circuit (Z+, Z-) of P such that Z+  S and Z-  R for S, R  T .

We use |T | to refer to the geometric simplicial complex corresponding to T . We have that T is a combinatorial triangulation of P if and only if |T | is a geometric triangulation of P. A proof of this can be found in [Ram97, Proposition 2.2]. In this paper we are usually concerned with combinatorial triangulations, but sometimes we shall need to consider geometric triangulations. When we do so we will implicitly pick a geometric realisation of C(m, ) given by an arbitrary tuple of points on the moment curve, since the properties we will be considering will be independent of the precise choice.
One can use the descriptions of the facets and circuits of C(m, ) to determine whether or not a collection T of -simplices gives a triangulation of C(m, ). We denote the set of triangulations of a cyclic polytope by S(m, ). There are two triangulations of C(m, ) which are of particular note. Namely, the lower facets F l([m],  + 1) of C(m,  + 1) give a triangulation of C(m, ), which is known as the lower triangulation. Similarly, F u([m],  + 1) gives a triangulation of C(m, ), which is known as the upper triangulation.
Given a triangulation T of C(m, ) and H  [m], we say that C(H, ) is a subpolytope of T if the facets F (H, ) of C(H, ) are a simplicial subcomplex of T . Equivalently, we have that C(H, ) is a subpolytope of T if and only if { S  T : S  H } is a triangulation of C(H, ). We refer to this triangulation as the induced triangulation of C(H, ).

2.2. The higher Stasheff­Tamari orders. We now come to the definitions of

the two higher Stasheff­Tamari orders. General introductions to these orders can

be found in [RR] and [DRS10, Section 6.1].

We make some observations to motivate the definition of the first higher Stasheff­

Tamari order. Given H 

[m] +2

,

we

have

that

C(H, )

has

only

two

triangulations,

namely: the lower triangulation and the upper triangulation. For example, if  = 2,

then C(H, ) is a quadrilateral, with the two possible triangulations given by a choice

of diagonal. Now suppose that C(H, ) is a subpolytope of T where the induced

triangulation of C(H, ) is the lower triangulation. Let T  = (T \ F l(H,  + 1)) 

F u(H,  + 1); that is, T  results from replacing the induced triangulation of C(H, )

with the upper triangulation. Then T  is also a triangulation of C(m, ) and we

say that T  is an increasing bistellar flip of T . Dually, we say that T is a decreasing

bistellar flip of T . We often simply say increasing flip or decreasing flip. Bistellar

flips are also known as "Pachner moves" after [Pac91].

The first higher Stasheff­Tamari order is the partial order on triangulations of

C(m, ) with covering relations such that T 1 T  if and only if T  is an increasing bistellar flip of T . We write S1(m, ) for the poset on S(m, ) this gives and 1 for

the partial order itself.

We now define the second higher Stasheff­Tamari order. Unlike the first higher

Stasheff­Tamari order, this order is defined using the geometric realisation of the

THE TWO HIGHER STASHEFF­TAMARI ORDERS ARE EQUAL

11

cyclic polytope, although the order itself is independent of the geometric realisation. In Section 2.3 we shall explain the entirely combinatorial characterisation of the second higher Stasheff­Tamari order from [Wil20a].
Every triangulation |T | of C(m, ) determines a unique piecewise-linear section

T : C(m, )  C(m,  + 1)
of C(m,  + 1) by sending each -simplex |S| of |T | to |S|+1 in C(m,  + 1), in the natural way. The second higher Stasheff­Tamari order on S(m, ) is defined as
T 2 T   T (x)+1 T  (x)+1 x  C(m, ),
where T (x)+1 denotes the ( + 1)-th coordinate of the point T (x). We write S2(m, ) for the poset on S(m, ) this gives. Given triangulations T  S(m, ) and T   S(m,  + 1), we say that T is a section of T  if T is contained in T  as a simplicial subcomplex.

2.3. Combinatorial characterisation. We now explain the results of [Wil20a], where combinatorial interpretations were given of both higher Stasheff­Tamari orders in the same framework. This makes comparison between the orders much easier. It is these interpretations of the higher Stasheff­Tamari orders that we use in this paper to prove that the orders are equivalent.
The combinatorial interpretations of the orders from [Wil20a] require more sophisticated combinatorial descriptions of triangulations of cyclic polytopes than that of Section 2.1.3. We call a simplex A  [m] an internal simplex of C(m, ) if A does not lie within any facet of C(m, ). It follows from [Dey93] that a triangulation of C(m, ) is determined by its internal /2-simplices, as explained for even dimensions in [OT12, Lemma 2.15] and for odd dimensions in [Wil20a, Lemma 4.4]. We can thus combinatorially describe triangulations of cyclic polytopes by characterising when a set of d-simplices in [m] is the set of internal d-simplices of a triangulation of C(m, 2d) or C(m, 2d + 1).
In order to do this, we first need to know when A is an internal d-simplex of C(m, ). In even dimensions, A is an internal d-simplex of C(m, 2d) if and only if

A  Idm := { B  [m]d+1 : bi bi+1 - 2 i  [d], and bd b0 + m - 2 }.

In odd dimensions, A is an internal d-simplex of C(m, 2d + 1) if and only if

A  Jdm := { B  Idm : b0 = 1, bd = m }.

These two facts both follow from applying Gale's Evenness Criterion. Given a

triangulation T of C(m, 2d) or C(m, 2d + 1), we write °e(T ) for its set of internal

d-simplices.

In even dimensions, given X  Idm, we have that X = °e(T ) for some triangula-

tion T of C(m, 2d) if and only if #X =

m-d-2 d

and X is non-intertwining [OT12,

Theorem 2.3 and Theorem 2.4].

12

Remark 2.3. Note that our sets °e(T ) are different from the sets e(T ) from [OT12],

since the latter contain d-simplices which do not lie in any lower facets of C(m, 2d),

but may contain d-simplices lying in upper facets of C(m, 2d). Given a triangulation

T of C(m, 2d), we have that e(T ) \ °e(T ) consists of all the d-simplices lying in the

upper facets of C(m, 2d) which do not lie in any lower facets of C(m, 2d). One

can verify that this set has cardinality

m-d-2 d-1

,

and

hence

#e(T )

=

,

as

in

[OT12,

Theorem

2.3

and

Theorem

2.4].

In odd dimensions we require the following properties to characterise triangulations combinatorially. Let X  Jdm. We say that X is supporting if for any A  X , there exists a (d - 1)-simplex E such that E  A and for any internal d-simplex B such that B  A  E, we have that B  X . Here we call E a support for A. We say that X is bridging if whenever

{q0, . . . , qi-1, ai, . . . , aj, qj+1, . . . , qd}  X , and {q0, . . . , qi-1, bi, . . . , bj, qj+1, . . . , qd}  X ,

where possibly i = 0 or j = d, or both, such that (ai, . . . , aj)  (bi, . . . , bj), we have that
{q0, . . . , qi-1, ai, . . . , ak-1, bk, . . . , bj, qj+1 . . . , qd}  X
for all i k j + 1. We then have that X = °e(T ) for some triangulation T of C(m, 2d + 1) if and only if X is supporting and bridging [Wil20a, Theorem 4.1].
Building on this, one can characterise the higher Stasheff­Tamari orders combinatorially in terms of the sets °e(T ). In even dimensions, given T , T   S(m, 2d), by [Wil20a, Theorem 3.3 and Theorem 3.6] we have that
· T 1 T  if and only if °e(T ) = R  {A} and °e(T ) = R  {B}, where A  B; · T 2 T  if and only if for every A  °e(T ), there is no B  °e(T ) such that
B  A. In odd dimensions, given T , T   S(m, 2d + 1), by [Wil20a, Theorem 5.5 and Corollary 5.14] we have that
· T 1 T  if and only if °e(T ) = °e(T )  {A} for some A  Jdm \ °e(T ); · T 2 T  if and only if °e(T )  °e(T ).
It is useful to think of increasing bistellar flips in these terms. That is, in even dimensions, given triangulations T , T  with °e(T ) = R  {A} and °e(T ) = R  {B} and A  B, the increasing bistellar flip replaces the d-simplex A with the d-simplex B inside C(A  B, 2d). This is because A is the intersection of F l(A  B,  + 1) and B is the intersection of F u(A  B,  + 1). Here we say that A is a mutable d-simplex in T . For odd dimensions, suppose that we have T , T  with °e(T ) = °e(T )  {A} for some A  Jdm \ °e(T ). Then there exists a (d + 1)-simplex B with A  B such that the increasing bistellar flip occurs inside the subpolytope C(A  B, 2d + 1). The increasing bistellar flip then replaces the d-simplex A with

the (d + 1)-simplex B inside this subpolytope. This is likewise because A is the intersection of F l(A  B,  + 1) and B is the intersection of F u(A  B,  + 1). We also say here that A is a mutable d-simplex in T . Under these conceptions, we think of increasing bistellar flips as replacing one half of a circuit with another.

2.4. Operations on triangulations. Our proof of the equivalence of the orders is inductive and uses the following operations on triangulations, which were introduced in [Ram97] based on the corresponding operations on oriented matroids from [BL78]. However, note that our notation and terminology is swapped from [BL78; Ram97], following [OT12], since this fits better with how the operations behave on cyclic polytopes.

2.4.1. Operations at the first or last vertex. If S  [m] is a k-simplex, we define the

contraction S[m - 1  m] of S by





S

S[m - 1  m] := (S \ m)  m - 1

if m / S, otherwise.

Note that S[m-1  m] is a (k-1)-simplex if S  {m-1, m}. Given a triangulation T of C(m, ), we define the contraction T [m - 1  m] to be the triangulation of C(m - 1, ) given by

T [m - 1  m] =

S[m - 1  m] 

[m-1] +1

:ST

.

This is indeed a triangulation of C(m - 1, ) by [Ram97, Theorem 4.2(iii)]. This corresponds to the triangulation obtained from |T | by moving vertex |m| along the

moment curve until it coincides with vertex |m - 1|, as illustrated in Figure 2.

Given a triangulation T of C(m, ), we define the deletion T \m to be the trian-

gulation of C(m - 1,  - 1) given by

T \m = { S \ m : S  T , m  S }.

This is indeed a triangulation of C(m - 1,  - 1) by [Ram97, Theorem 4.2(ii)]. This the triangulation induced by |T | on the vertex figure of C(m, ) at |m|, as illustrated in Figure 3.

These operations behave well with respect to the higher Stasheff­Tamari orders. By [Ram97, Proposition 5.14], the operation [m - 1  m] is order-preserving with respect to the first order, whilst the operation -\m is order-reversing. By [Tho02, Theorem 4.1] and [ER96, Proposition 2.11], the operation -[m - 1  m] is orderpreserving with respect to the second order, whilst the operation -\m is orderreversing.
We shall need to use the following combinatorial characterisations of contraction. In even dimensions
°e(T [m - 1  m]) = { A[m - 1  m]  Idm-1 : A  °e(T ) }
by [OT12, Lemma 2.23]. In odd dimensions

°e(T [m - 1  m]) = { A  °e(T ) : ad = m - 1 }

by [Wil20a, Lemma 4.12]. There are analogous operations -[1  2] and -\1, which are order-preserving for both orders.
We will also use the extension operation from [Ram97] in Section 3.4. Given a triangulation T of C(m, ), we define T^ to be the triangulation of C(m + 1,  + 1) given by

T^ := T  (m + 1)  { (S \ s)  {l, l + 1} : S  T , s-1 < l < s },

where

T  (m + 1) := { S  {m + 1} : S  T }.

More generally, given a set of simplices U in V and a set N  [m] \ V , then

U  N := { S  N : S  U }. One can verify easily that T^ \(m + 1) = T .

2.4.2. Operations at middle vertices. In this paper we also consider contractions of triangulations at other pairs of vertices besides [1  2] and [m - 1  m]. For this purpose we let [m - 1]v+ := {1, . . . , v - 1, x, y, v + 1, . . . , m - 1}. We also extend this notation in a natural way to H  [m - 1], so that Hv+ = (H \ v)  {x, y} if v  H, and H = H otherwise.

THE TWO HIGHER STASHEFF­TAMARI ORDERS ARE EQUAL

15

Given a k-simplex S  [m - 1]v+, we define





S

S[x  v  y] := (S \ {x, y})  v

if {x, y}  S = , otherwise.

Given a triangulation T of C([m - 1]v+, ), we then define T [x  v  y] to be the triangulation of C(m - 1, ) given by

T [x  v  y] :=

S[x  v  y] 

[m-1] +1

:ST

.

This is indeed a triangulation of C(m-1, ) by [RS00, Theorem 3.3]. Geometrically,

it is obtained from |T | by moving |x| and |y| along the moment curve towards each

other until they coincide with each other at a new vertex, which we label |v|. We

choose to relabel [m] as [m-1]v+ here so that there does not appear to be a missing vertex after contraction. It is also useful to distinguish between the two vertices

before contraction and the vertex after contraction.

In order to understand how the contractions [x  v  y] behave, we will

consider the deletion operation at other vertices too. Indeed, given C(m, ) and

v  [m], define the combinatorial vertex figure at v to be the combinatorial polytope

C(m, )\v = ([m] \ v, Fv([m] \ v, ), Zv([m] \ v, )), where

Fv([m] \ v, ) = { F  [m] \ v : F  v  F ([m], ) }, and

Zv([m] \ v, ) = { (Z-, Z+) : (Z-  v, Z+)  Z([m], ) or (Z-, Z+  v)  Z([m], ) }.

Given a triangulation T of C(m, ), we define the deletion T \v to be the triangulation
T \v := { S \ v : S  T , v  S }.
It follows straightforwardly from the definition of C(m, )\v and the definition of a combinatorial triangulation that T \v is a triangulation of C(m, )\v. Note also that |T \v| may be realised geometrically as the triangulation induced by |T | on the vertex figure of C(m, ) at v.
Finally, we shall also consider triangulations given by deleting multiple vertices. Given a triangulation T of C(m, ) and V  [m], we define

T \V := { S \ V : S  T , V  S }.

In the examples we consider here, V will always be a pair of consecutive vertices, such as {1, 2} or {m - 1, m} in [m], or {x, y} in [m]v+.

3. Equality of the two orders
In this section we prove that the higher Stasheff­Tamari orders are equal. What we need to establish is that for T , T   S(m, ) with T <2 T , then we can find a triangulation T  either such that T 1 T  2 T , or such that T 2 T  1 T . See Lemma 3.3 for more detail on this point. Following [Wil20a], we treat the odd-dimensional cases separately from the even-dimensional cases. The details of the proof are different for these two cases, but the broad outlines are similar. We explain these outlines now.
The proof is by induction on the number of vertices of the cyclic polytope C(m, ), noting that the orders are known to be equal when m  + 3 [RR]. We start with triangulations T , T  of C(m, ) such that T <2 T . We perform contractions to obtain triangulations T [m - 1  m] and T [m - 1  m] of C(m - 1, ). In the case that T [m-1  m] = T [m-1  m], we apply the induction hypothesis to these triangulations. This provides an increasing flip U of T [m - 1  m] such that U 2 T [m - 1  m], and hence provides a subpolytope of T [m - 1  m] congruent to C( + 2, ). We consider the pre-image of this subpolytope in T . If the pre-image of this subpolytope is congruent to C( + 2, ), then we choose the increasing flip inside this subpolytope to obtain our triangulation T . As we show in Lemma 3.4, the only other option is that the preimage of the C( + 2, ) subpolytope is a subpolytope congruent to C( + 3, ). This polytope is still relatively small and the triangulations of it are well-understood, as recorded in Lemma 3.1. We can find an increasing bistellar flip T  of T which occurs within the induced triangulation of this C( + 3, ) subpolytope. We then show that if we do not have T  2 T , then there is a contradiction of the existence of the increasing bistellar flip we chose using the induction hypothesis. Deriving this contradiction requires a series of lemmas, and the details differ between even and odd dimensions.
If T [m - 1  m] = T [m - 1  m], then we instead consider the contractions T [1  2] and T [1  2]. If T [1  2] = T [1  2], then we can apply symmetries of the cyclic polytope to convert to the case where T [m - 1  m] = T [m - 1  m].
If we have that both T [1  2] = T [1  2] and T [m - 1  m] = T [m - 1  m], then one can apply the results of [Wil20a] to show that, since we have T <2 T , there must be a v  [2, m - 2] such that if we relabel the vertices of C(m, ) such that T , T  are triangulations of C([m - 1]v+ , ), then we have that T [x  v  y] = T [x  v  y]. Then one can proceed similarly to before.
We hence give explicit inductive proofs of the equivalence of the orders in both even and odd dimensions. However, in Section 3.4, we note that it in fact suffices only to give an explicit proof for one parity, since the result for the other parity can be deduced from this.
3.1. Preliminary lemmas. We begin by proving some preliminary lemmas and recording some known results which we shall need. The proofs of three key lemmas

THE TWO HIGHER STASHEFF­TAMARI ORDERS ARE EQUAL

17

(Lemma 3.4, Lemma 3.5 and Lemma 3.6) will be postponed to Section 4, which concerns the theory behind the contraction [x  v  y].
The following lemma records the possible triangulations of C( + 3, ) and their properties. These triangulations are already well understood; for instance, see [Tho03, Proof of Proposition 9.1]. This lemma can be verified using the results described in Section 2.3.

Lemma 3.1. The triangulations of C( + 3, ) may be described as follows. (1) If  = 2d, then (a) C(2d + 3, 2d) has 2d + 3 triangulations T1, . . . , T2d+3; (b) the triangulation Ti is the fan triangulation at the vertex i, that is
°e(Ti) = { A  Id2d+3 : i  A };
(c) the poset S1(2d + 3, 2d) = S2(2d + 3, 2d) is as shown in Figure 4. (d) the bistellar flips of the triangulations are as follows:
· T1 possesses two increasing bistellar flips: one which replaces {1, 3, . . . , 2d + 1} with {2, 4, . . . , 2d + 2} and one which replaces {1, 4, . . . , 2d + 2} with {3, 5, . . . , 2d + 3};
· for i even, Ti admits an increasing flip replacing {1, 3, . . . , i - 3, i, i + 2, . . . , 2d + 2} with {2, 4, . . . , i - 2, i + 1, i + 3, . . ., 2d + 3};
· for i odd with i / {1, 2d + 3}, Ti admits an increasing flip which replaces {1, 3, . . . , i, i+3, . . . , 2d+2} with {2, 4, . . . , i-1, i+2, i+ 4, . . . , 2d + 3}.
(2) If  = 2d + 1, then (a) C(2d + 4, 2d + 1) has 2d + 4 triangulations T1, . . . , T2d+4; (b) the triangulations Ti have the following sets of internal d-simplices:
°e(T1) = Jd2d+4, °e(T2d+4) = ,
for i = 2d + 4 even
°e(Ti) = {2, 4, . . . , 2d+2}, {2, . . . , 2d, 2d+3}, . . . , {2, 4, . . . , i, i+3, i+5, . . . , 2d+3} ,
and for i = 1 odd
°e(Ti) = {2, 4, . . . , i-3, i, i+2, . . . , 2d+3}, , . . . , {2, 5, . . . , 2d+3}, {3, 5, . . . , 2d+3} ;
(c) the poset S1(2d+4, 2d+1) = S2(2d+4, 2d+1) is as shown in Figure 4. (d) the bistellar flips of the triangulations are as follows:
(i) T1 admits two increasing bistellar flips: one from removing {2, 4, . . . , 2d + 2} and one from removing {3, 5, . . . , 2d + 3};
(ii) for i = 2d + 4 even, Ti admits an increasing bistellar flip from removing {2, 4, . . . , i, i + 3, i + 5, . . . , 2d + 3};

(iii) for i = 1 odd, Ti admits an increasing bistellar flip from removing {2, 4, . . . , i - 3, i, i + 2, . . . , 2d + 3}.
Example 3.2. We give examples of the triangulations described in Lemma 3.1. We denote each triangulation Ti by its set of internal d-simplices °e(T ). The poset S1(7, 4) = S2(7, 4) is shown in Figure 5. The poset S1(8, 5) = S2(8, 5) is shown in Figure 6.
The following lemma is straightforward, but serves to clarify what needs to be proven in order to show that the orders are equivalent.
Lemma 3.3. The following are equivalent.

(1) For any pair of triangulations T , T   S(m, ), we have that T 1 T   T 2 T .
(2) For any pair of triangulations T , T   S(m, ) such that T <2 T , there exists a triangulation T   S(m, ) such that T 1 T  2 T .
(3) For any pair of triangulations T , T   S(m, ) such that T <2 T , there exists a triangulation T   S(m, ) such that T 2 T  1 T .

Proof. First note that it is already known from [ER96, Proposition 2.5] that if T 1 T , then T 2 T . To show that (1) implies (2) and (3), suppose that we have T , T   S(m, ) such that T <2 T . Then, from (1), it follows that T <1 T , so that we have
T = T0 1 T1 1 · · · 1 Tr = T .
Hence we have T 1 T1 1 T , and so T 1 T1 2 T  and (2) holds. Similarly T 2 Tr-1 1 T , and so (3) holds as well.
We now show that (2) implies (1). We can assume that T <2 T , since if T = T , then it is trivial that T 1 T . Then, by applying (2), we obtain that there is a triangulation T1  S(m, ) such that
T 1 T1 2 T .

20

NICHOLAS J. WILLIAMS

By applying (2) repeatedly, we obtain a chain
T = T0 1 T1 1 · · · 1 Tr = T .
This then establishes that T <1 T , as desired. The proof that (3) implies (1) is similar.
The proof of the following three lemmas will be postponed to Section 4, since Lemma 3.5 requires substantial groundwork. Lemma 3.4 follows from Lemma 3.5 by choosing v = m - 1, but, since it does not require the groundwork that Lemma 3.5 does, it will be useful to prove it separately as a preamble to the proof of Lemma 3.5. Lemma 3.6 is proven in Section 4 since it also concerns contractions [x  v  y].

Lemma 3.4. Let T be a triangulation of C(m - 1, ). Suppose that T contains a cyclic subpolytope C(H, ). Let T be a triangulation of C(m, ) such that T [m-1  m] = T . Then either
(1) C(H, ) is a subpolytope of T and m - 1 / H, (2) C((H \ m - 1)  m, ) is a subpolytope of T , where m - 1  H, or (3) C(H  m, ) is a subpolytope of T , where m - 1  H.

Lemma 3.5. Let T be a triangulation of C(m - 1, ). Suppose that T contains a cyclic subpolytope C(H, ). Let T be a triangulation of C([m - 1]v+, ) such that T [x  v  y] = T . Then either
(1) C(H, ) is a subpolytope of T and v / H, (2) C((H \ v)  x, ) is a subpolytope of T , where v  H, (3) C((H \ v)  y, ) is a subpolytope of T , where v  H, or (4) C(Hv+, ) is a subpolytope of T , where v  H.

Lemma 3.6. The contraction [x  v  y] is order-preserving with respect to the second higher Stasheff­Tamari order. That is, if T and T  are triangulations of C([m - 1]v+, ), with T 2 T , then T 2 T , where T = T [x  v  y] and T  = T [x  v  y].

3.2. Odd dimensions. We now prove the equivalence of the orders for odd dimensions. We begin by showing some preliminary lemmas which are specific to odd dimensions.

Lemma 3.7. Let T  S(m, 2d + 1) be a triangulation with a mutable d-simplex A  °e(T ) which is replaced by the (d + 1)-simplex B in the increasing flip. Then B = {b1, . . . , bd} is the unique support of A.
Proof. First note that B is a support of A. This follows from the fact that every d-simplex contained in A  B, excluding A, contains consecutive entries in A  B, and is therefore a d-simplex of T , since it lies on the boundary of C(A  B, 2d + 1), which is a subpolytope of T .

THE TWO HIGHER STASHEFF­TAMARI ORDERS ARE EQUAL

21

We now suppose that A possesses a support E = {e1, . . . , ed}. We show that if ei = bi for any i, then T contains a d-simplex which forms a circuit with a (d + 1)-simplex in the boundary of C(A  B, 2d + 1). This is a contradiction, since C(A  B, 2d + 1) is a subpolytope of T . The internal (d + 1)-simplices of C(A  B, 2d + 1) consist of B along with the (d + 1)-simplices which have A as a face, by Gale's Evenness Criterion. All other (d + 1)-simplices in C(A  B, 2d + 1) lie on the boundary.
Suppose that ei < bi for some i. Then, since E is a support of A,
°e(T )  {a0, . . . , ai-2, ei, ai, . . . , ad}  {b0, . . . , bi-2, ai-1, bi, bi+1, . . . , bd+1},
which is a boundary (d + 1)-simplex of C(A  B, 2d + 1). Suppose instead that ei > bi for some i. Then, since E is a support of A,
°e(T )  {a0, . . . , ai-1, ei, ai+1, . . . , ad}  {b0, . . . , bi, ai, bi+2, . . . , bd+1},
which is a boundary (d + 1)-simplex of C(A  B, 2d + 1). Therefore, we must have E = B, which entails that B is the unique support of A.
The following lemma helps us to understand what supports look like in triangulations of C(2d + 4, 2d + 1). This is useful when we expand from C(2d + 3, 2d + 1) subpolytopes to C(2d + 4, 2d + 1) subpolytopes.

Lemma 3.8. Let T be a triangulation of C(2d+4, 2d+1) which is neither the upper triangulation nor the lower triangulation. Let A be the unique mutable d-simplex of T with E the support of A. Then every non-mutable internal d-simplex A of T has A  A  E.

Proof. Note first that T has a unique mutable d-simplex by Lemma 3.1. One can then proceed by direct verification. Suppose that we have the triangulation Ti of C(2d + 4, 2d + 1), where i is even and i = 2d + 4. Hence, as in Lemma 3.1, we have °e(Ti) is
{2, 4, . . . , 2d + 2}, {2, 4 . . . , 2d, 2d + 3)}, . . . , {2, 4, . . . , i, i + 3, i + 5, . . . , 2d + 3} .
The mutable (d + 1)-simplex here is A = {2, 4, . . . , i, i + 3, i + 5, . . . , 2d + 3} by Lemma 3.1. One can verify that this has support E = {3, 5, . . . , i - 1, i + 2, i + 4, . . . , 2d + 2}. Indeed, the internal d-simplices contained in {2, 4, . . . , i, i + 3, i + 5, . . . , 2d + 3}  {3, 5, . . . , i - 1, i + 2, i + 4, . . . , 2d + 2} are precisely °e(T ). This establishes the claim when i is even, and the case where i is odd is the mirror image of this.
The next lemma is the inductive step of the proof of the equivalence of the orders for odd dimensions. Giving it as a separate lemma simplifies the presentation of the proof.

Lemma 3.9. Let T , T   S([m - 1]v+, 2d + 1) be triangulations such that T <2 T  and T [x  v  y] <2 T [x  v  y]. Suppose that T [x  v  y] possesses an increasing flip U such that T [x  v  y] 1 U 2 T [x  v  y]. Then T possesses an increasing flip T  such that T 1 T  2 T .

Proof. Let the increasing flip from T [x  v  y] to U consist of replacing the dsimplex A with the (d+1)-simplex B inside the cyclic subpolytope C(AB, 2d+1). We must then have that A / °e(T [x  v  y]) since U 2 T [x  v  y] implies that °e(T [x  v  y]) \ {A} = °e(U)  °e(T [x  v  y]).
By Lemma 3.5, we have that either
(1) C(A  B, 2d + 1) is a subpolytope of T , where v / A  B, (2) C((A  B  x) \ v, 2d + 1) is a subpolytope of T , where v  A  B, (3) C((A  B  y) \ v, 2d + 1) is a subpolytope of T , where v  A  B, or (4) C((A  B)v+, 2d + 1) is a subpolytope of T , where v  A  B.
We deal with each of these cases in turn.
(1) Suppose that C(A  B, 2d + 1) is a subpolytope of T . Then the induced triangulation of this subpolytope must contain A, since A  °e(T [x  v  y]) and the contraction does not affect the subpolytope C(A  B, 2d + 1). Since A is contained in the subpolytope C(A  B, 2d + 1) of T , we have that T admits an increasing flip T  where °e(T ) = °e(T ) \ A. Furthermore, A / °e(T ), since A / °e(T [x  v  y]). Thus, we have T 1 T  2 T .
(2) Suppose now that C((A  B  x) \ v, 2d + 1) is a subpolytope of T , where v  A  B. If v  A, then let A = (A  x) \ v. Otherwise, let A = A. Then the induced triangulation of the subpolytope C((A  B  x) \ v, 2d + 1) must contain A, since A  °e(T [x  v  y]), so there must be a simplex which contracts to A. Moreover, A is contained in the subpolytope C((A  B  x) \ v, 2d + 1) of T , so that T admits an increasing flip T  where °e(T ) = °e(T ) \ A. We also have that A / °e(T ), because A / °e(T [x  v  y]). Hence T 1 T  2 T , as desired.
(3) The case where C((AB y)\v, 2d+1) is a subpolytope of T with v  AB behaves similarly to the previous case.
(4) Consider now the case where C((A  B  {x, y}) \ v, 2d + 1) is a subpolytope of T . Then the triangulation of this subpolytope induced by T must contain a d-simplex A such that A[x  v  y] = A. This d-simplex A must be internal in C((AB{x, y})\v, 2d+1), since A is internal in C(AB, 2d+1). Hence the induced triangulation of C((A  B  {x, y}) \ v, 2d + 1) cannot be the upper triangulation. Moreover, we cannot have A  °e(T ), since this implies that A  °e(T [x  v  y]).
Suppose first that the induced triangulation is the lower triangulation Tl of C((A  B  {x, y}) \ v, 2d + 1). Then, by Lemma 3.1, the lower triangulation Tl contains two mutable d-simplices, which we call J and K. Suppose that we have both J, K  °e(T ). Then, by the bridging property, T  must contain every internal d-simplex in Tl. But this means that A  °e(T ). Thus, at least one of J and K is

23

not a d-simplex of T . Hence, let T  be the increasing flip of T defined by removing whichever of J and K is not a d-simplex of T . We therefore have T 1 T  2 T , as desired.
Now suppose that the induced triangulation of C((A  B, {x, y}) \ v, 2d + 1) is neither the lower triangulation nor the upper triangulation. Then, by Lemma 3.1, the induced triangulation has a unique mutable d-simplex L. By Lemma 3.7, L has a unique support E in °e(T ). We then have that A  L  E, by Lemma 3.8.
Suppose that L  °e(T ). Let E be the support of L in °e(T ). Then, since °e(T )  °e(T ), we have that E is a support of L in °e(T ). This implies that E = E, by Lemma 3.7. In turn, this implies that A  °e(T ), which is a contradiction. Therefore, if T  is the triangulation of C(m, 2d + 1) such that °e(T ) = °e(T ) \ {L}, then we must have that T 1 T  2 T , as desired.

We now have enough preliminaries in place to prove the equivalence of the orders in odd dimensions.

Theorem 3.10. Let T , T  be triangulations of C(m, 2d + 1). Then T 1 T  if and only if T 2 T .

Proof. We prove the result by induction on the number of vertices of the cyclic polytope. We may use the cases where m - (2d + 1) 3 as base cases, since the result is already known for these cases, as noted in [RR]. Indeed, for m = 2d + 2, the cyclic polytope C(m, 2d + 1) is a (2d + 1)-simplex, so the result is trivial. The result is also clear for m = 2d + 3, since here the cyclic polytope C(m, 2d + 1) only has two triangulations. Finally, one may check the case where m = 2d + 4 by applying the results of [Wil20a] to Lemma 3.1. Hence, from now on, we assume that m > 2d + 4.
As in Lemma 3.3, we seek a triangulation T  such that T 1 T  2 T . The existence of such a triangulation will establish our claim. We now split into three cases.
(1) Suppose that T [m - 1  m] = T [m - 1  m]. Then, by the induction hypothesis, T [m - 1  m] admits an increasing flip U such that T [m - 1  m]1 U 2 T [m- 1  m]. By applying Lemma 3.9 with m- 1 and m relabelled as x and y, we obtain that T possesses an increasing flip T  such that T 1 T  2 T .
(2) We now suppose that T [1  2] = T [1  2], so that T [1  2] <2 T [1  2]. By [ER96, Proposition 2.11], the permutation

... m-1 m

m m-1 ... 2 1

on the vertices of the cyclic polytope induces an order-preserving bijection  on both S1(m, 2d + 1) and S2(m, 2d + 1). We then have that (T [1  2]) = (T )[m - 1  m] <2 (T )[m - 1  m] = (T [1  2]). Hence, by applying the previous case,

24

NICHOLAS J. WILLIAMS

we obtain a triangulation T  such that (T )1 T  2 (T ). By applying  again, we obtain that T 1 (T ) 2 T , which resolves this case.
(3) We may now suppose that we are in neither of the previous cases, so that T [1  2] = T [1  2] and T [m - 1  m] = T [m - 1  m]. Hence, by the combinatorial interpretation of contraction mentioned in Section 2.4.1, we must have that
{ A  °e(T ) : 2 / A } = { A  °e(T ) : 2 / A },
{ A  °e(T ) : m - 1 / A } = { A  °e(T ) : m - 1 / A },
and so °e(T ) and °e(T ) only differ in simplices containing both 2 and m - 1. Let A be a subset such that A  °e(T ) \°e(T ). Then {2, m - 1}  A. There must be some i  [d] such that ai - ai-1 > 2, otherwise m - 1 = 2d + 2, and we are supposing that this is not the case because m = 2d + 3 is a base case.
Relabel [m] as [m - 1]v+, and relabel A correspondingly, such that ai-1 < x < y < ai and then perform the contraction [x  v  y]. Lemma 3.6 tells us that T [x  v  y] 2 T [x  v  y]. Moreover, T [x  v  y] <2 T [x  v  y], since A  °e(T [x  v  y]) \ °e(T [x  v  y]). By the induction hypothesis, there is a increasing flip U of T [x  v  y] such that T [x  v  y] 1 U 2 T [x  v  y]. We then apply Lemma 3.9 to obtain that there exists an increasing flip T  of T such that T 1 T  2 T .

3.3. Even dimensions. We now prove the equivalence of the orders for even dimensions, beginning by proving preliminary lemmas specific to this parity.
Lemma 3.11. Let T , T   S(m, 2d) such that T <2 T . Suppose that T admits an increasing flip T  which is the result of replacing the d-simplex A by the dsimplex B. Then, we have that T  2 T  if and only if {ao0, a1, . . . , ad}  °e(T ) for some ao0 such that a0 ao0 < b0.
Proof. If T  2 T , then there must exist some J  °e(T ) such that J  B, since T <2 T . Because we flip from A to B in T , every internal d-simplex in A  B, excluding B, must be in °e(T ) by [OT12, Proposition 4.6]. Indeed, they all lie in the facets of the subpolytope C(A  B, 2d). Hence, if there is a d-simplex K  A  B such that J  K, then this contradicts T 2 T . If we have ji < ai for some i, then J (B \{bi}){ai}. Similarly, if, for i = 0, we have ji > ai, then J (B \{bi-1}){ai}. Thus, we must have J = {ao0, a1, . . . , ad}, where ao0 a0. That ao0 < b0 follows from the fact that J  B.
Conversely, it is clear that if J = {ao0, a1, . . . , ad}  °e(T ) such that a0 ao0 < b0, then J  B, so that we have T  2 T .
We call such a simplex {ao0, a1, . . . , ad}  °e(T ) where a0 ao0 < b0 an obstruction to the increasing flip of T which replaces A with B. By Lemma 3.3, in order to

THE TWO HIGHER STASHEFF­TAMARI ORDERS ARE EQUAL

25

prove the equivalence of the orders in even dimensions, we must find an increasing flip of T which is not obstructed by T . The following lemma allows us to describe the 2d-simplex lying below the obstructing d-simplex.

Lemma 3.12. Let T , T   S(m, 2d) such that T <2 T . Suppose that T admits

an increasing flip via replacing the d-simplex A with the d-simplex B, and that

{ao0, a1, . . . , ad}  T , where a0 {ao0, b0, a1, b1, . . . , bd-1, ad}.

ao0 < b0. Then T  contains the 2d-simplex

Proof. By [OT12, Proposition 2.13], there exists a 2d-simplex S = {ao0, q0, a1, q1, . . . , qd-1, ad} in T . We will show that we must have qi = bi for all i by ruling out
the other cases.
Suppose that qi < bi for some i. Then {a1, . . . , ai, bi, . . . , bd}  °e(T ), since it is in the boundary of C(A  B, 2d), and {q0, . . . , qi, ai+1, . . . , ad}  °e(T ), since it is contained in S. But this contradicts T <2 T , since {q0, . . . , qi, ai+1, . . . , ad} 
{a1, . . . , ai, bi, . . . , bd}.
Now suppose that qi > bi for some i. Then {b0, . . . , bi, ai+1, . . . , ad}  °e(T ), since it is in the boundary of C(AB, 2d), and {ao0, a1, . . . , ai, qi, . . . , qd-1}  °e(T ), since it is contained in S. But this contradicts T <2 T , since {ao0, a1, . . . , ai, qi, . . . , qd-1} {b0, . . . , bi, ai+1, . . . , ad}, noting that ao0 < b0. Thus qi = bi for all i, as desired, which completes the proof.

We will use the following lemma and its corollary to find the right pair of middle vertices to contract at in the final case of our proof of the equivalence of the orders in even dimensions.

Lemma 3.13. Let T , T   S(m, 2d) be triangulations such that T <2 T . Suppose further that both T [1  2] = T [1  2] and T [m - 1  m] = T [m - 1  m]. Then, there exists A  °e(T ) \ °e(T ) and, for every such A, we have a0 = 1 and ad = m - 1. Dually, there exists B  °e(T ) \ °e(T ) and, for every such B, we have b0 = 2, bd = m.
Proof. Since we know that T = T , there must exist A  °e(T ) such that A / °e(T ). We then have that A must be intertwining with some B  °e(T ). Since T <2 T , we must in fact have that A  B. One may also arrive at this situation by first choosing B  °e(T ) such that B / °e(T ). If a0 > 1, then A  T [1  2] and B  T [1  2], which contradicts the fact that T [1  2] = T [1  2]. Hence a0 = 1, and we similarly argue that bd = m. We can continue with similar deductions. If b0 > 2, then T [1  2]  {2, a1, . . . , ad}  B  T [1  2]. Therefore b0 = 2, and we can likewise reason that ad = m - 1.
Corollary 3.14. Let T , T   S(m, 2d), with m > 2d + 3, be triangulations such that T <2 T , and both T [1  2] = T [1  2] and T [m- 1  m] = T [m- 1  m].

Then there exists v  [3, m - 2] such that if one relabels [m] as [m - 1]v+, then we have T [x  v  y] <2 T [x  v  y].
Proof. Since T <2 T , there must exist A  °e(T ) and B  °e(T ) such that A  B. By Lemma 3.13, we have that a0 = 1, b0 = 2, ad = m - 1, bd = m. Because m > 2d + 3, we must have [m] \ (A  B) = . We may therefore choose {v, v + 1}  [m] such that #{v, v + 1} (AB) 1 and {v, v + 1} {1, 2, m- 1, m} = . We then relabel [m] as [m - 1]v+ so that {v, v + 1} becomes {x, y}. We likewise relabel T , T , A, and B. If we let A, B be the respective images of A and B under the contraction [x  v  y], then, by our choice of v, we obtain that A  B. By Lemma 3.6, we obtain that T [x  v  y] <2 T [x  v  y].
We now prove that the orders are equivalent in even dimensions. The structure of the proof is similar to odd dimensions, but we are not able to extract the inductive step of the proof as a separate lemma, since the details differ between the contractions [m - 1  m] and [x  v  y].

Theorem 3.15. Let T , T  be triangulations of C(m, 2d). Then T 1 T  if and only if T 2 T .
Proof. As in the odd-dimensional case, we prove the result by induction on the number of vertices of the cyclic polytope. As noted in [RR], the result is already known for m - 2d 3, so we use these as the base cases of our induction. One may also easily verify the result in these cases in the same way as explained in the proof of Theorem 3.10.
Hence, we suppose for induction that we have triangulations T , T   S(m, 2d), where m > 2d + 3, such that T <2 T . We split into three cases, seeking a triangulation T  such that T 1 T  2 T .
(1) Suppose that T [m - 1  m] = T [m - 1  m], so that T [m - 1  m] <2 T [m - 1  m]. By the induction hypothesis, there exists a triangulation U such that T [m-1  m]1 U 2 T [m-1  m]. Let this increasing flip of T [m-1  m] be given by exchanging a d-simplex A for a d-simplex B. Therefore, we have that C(A  B, 2d) is a subpolytope of T [m - 1  m]. By Lemma 3.4, we have that either
(a) C(A  B, 2d) is a subpolytope of T , (b) C(A  B, 2d) is a subpolytope of T , where B = {b0, . . . , bd-1, m} and bd = m - 1, or (c) C(A  B  m, 2d) is a subpolytope of T , in which case bd = m - 1. We deal with each of these cases in turn. (a) Suppose first that C(A  B, 2d) is a subpolytope of T . This subpolytope therefore contains the d-simplex A, since it contains the d-simplex A in T [m - 1  m]. Thus T also admits an increasing flip by exchanging A for B to give a triangulation T . If T  2 T , then Ao = {ao0, a1, . . . , ad}  °e(T ) where a0

THE TWO HIGHER STASHEFF­TAMARI ORDERS ARE EQUAL

27

ao0 < b0, by Lemma 3.11. But then Ao  °e(T [m - 1  m]), since m / Ao, which contradicts U 2 T [m - 1  m]. Hence, in this case we have that T 1 T  2 T ,
as desired. (b) If C(A  B, 2d) is a subpolytope of T , then we may exchange A for B. If

there is an obstruction to this, then we get a contradiction in a similar way to the

previous case.

(c) Finally, suppose that C(A  B  m, 2d) is a subpolytope of T , in which case

bd = m - 1. The triangulation of this subpolytope induced by T must contain the d-simplex A, since m - 1 / A but A  °e(T [m - 1  m]). Since C(A  B  m, 2d)

is a cyclic polytope congruent to C(2d + 3, 2d), all the triangulations of C(A 

B  m, 2d) are fan triangulations, by Lemma 3.1. The possible triangulations of

C(A  B  m, 2d) then consist of the fan triangulations determined by the elements

ai  A, since we must have that A is a d-simplex of the induced triangulation of the subpolytope. By Lemma 3.1, the fan triangulation of C(A  B  m, 2d) at ai possesses an increasing flip at the d-simplex J = {a0, . . . , ai, bi+1, . . . , bd}, which is then exchanged for the d-simplex K = {b0, . . . , bi-1, ai+1, . . . , ad, m}.
Let T  be the triangulation resulting from performing this increasing flip on T .

If T  2 T , then J o = {ao0, a1, . . . , ai, bi+1, . . . , bd}  °e(T ) where a0 ao0 < b0, by Lemma 3.11. By Lemma 3.12, we conclude that {ao0, b0, a1, b1, . . . , ai, ai+1, bi+1, . . . , ad, bd} is a 2d-simplex of T . Consequently, Ao = {ao0, a1, . . . , ad}  °e(T ). This implies that Ao  °e(T [m - 1  m]), which obstructs the flip from T [m - 1  m]

to U. But we assumed that U 2 T [m - 1  m] using the induction hypothesis. We therefore conclude that we cannot have Jo  °e(T ). This means that we have

T 1 T  2 T , as desired. (2) We now suppose that T [1  2] = T [1  2]. By [ER96, Proposition 2.11],

the permutation

= 1

2

... m-1 m

m m-1 ... 2 1

on the vertices of the cyclic polytope induces an order-reversing bijection  on both

S1(m, 2d) and S2(m, 2d). We then have that (T [1  2]) = (T )[m - 1  m] >2 (T )[m - 1  m] = (T [1  2]). Hence, by applying the previous case, we

obtain a triangulation T  such that (T ) 1 T  2 (T ). By applying  again, we obtain that T 2 (T ) 1 T , which resolves this case, noting Lemma 3.3.
(3) We may now suppose that we have both T [m - 1  m] = T [m - 1  m]

and T [1  2] = T [1  2]. Since we are assuming that m > 2d + 3, we can apply

Corollary 3.14 and relabel [m] as [m-1]v+ such that T [x  v  y] <2 T [x  v  y]. By applying the induction hypothesis, we obtain that there exists an increasing

flip U of T [x  v  y] such that T [x  v  y] 1 U 2 T [x  v  y]. Suppose that this increasing bistellar flip replaces the d-simplex A with the d-simplex B.

Hence we have that C(AB, 2d) is a subpolytope of the triangulation T [x  v  y].

28

NICHOLAS J. WILLIAMS

Note then that
(T [x  v  y])[1  2] = (T [1  2])[x  v  y]
= (T [1  2])[x  v  y]
= (T [x  v  y])[1  2].
This follows from [RS00, Theorem 3.4], but can also be seen directly. We similarly reason that
(T [x  v  y])[m - 2  m - 1] = (T [x  v  y])[m - 2  m - 1].
Using these observations, we can deduce the values of the first and last elements of A and B. We know that A / °e(T [x  v  y]), since U is obtained from T [x  v  y] by replacing A with B, and U 2 T [x  v  y]. By applying Lemma 3.13 to A, we obtain that a0 = 1 and ad = m - 2. This implies that bd = m - 1. Since A / °e(T [x  v  y]), but (T [x  v  y])[1  2] = (T [x  v  y])[1  2], we must have {2, a1, . . . , ad}  °e(T [x  v  y]). But {2, a1, . . . , ad} is an obstruction to the flip from T [x  v  y] to U unless b0 = 2. We thus conclude that b0 = 2.
By Lemma 3.5, we have that either (a) C(A  B, 2d) is a subpolytope of T and v / A  B, (b) C((A  B  x) \ v, 2d) is a subpolytope of T , where v  A  B, (c) C((A  B  y) \ v, 2d) is a subpolytope of T , where v  A  B, or (d) C((A  B)v+, 2d) is a subpolytope of T , where v  A  B. We deal with each of these cases in turn. (a) We suppose that C(A  B, 2d) is a subpolytope of T and v / A  B. The induced triangulation of this subpolytope must contain the d-simplex A, since it contains the d-simplex A in T [x  v  y]. We hence perform an increasing flip on T by replacing A with B inside this subpolytope, obtaining a triangulation T . We claim that T  2 T . If not, then, by Lemma 3.11, there exists an obstruction Ao = {ao0, a1, . . . , ad}  °e(T ), where a0 ao0 < b0. But, since a0 = 1, b0 = 2, we must have that ao0 = a0. This means that A  °e(T ), which implies that A  °e(T [x  v  y]), which contradicts the fact that U 2 T [x  v  y]. (b) The case where C((A  B  x) \ v, 2d) is a subpolytope of T and v  A  B is largely analogous to the previous case, although there are additional details. We let A  B = (A  B  x) \ v, where A  B. Hence, we have A[x  v  y] = A and B[x  v  y] = B. We must have that the induced triangulation of the subpolytope C(A  B, 2d) contains the d-simplex A, since the induced triangulation of the subpolytope C(A  B, 2d) of T [x  v  y] contains A. We hence perform an increasing flip on T by replacing A with B inside this subpolytope, obtaining a triangulation T . We claim that T  2 T . If not, then, by Lemma 3.11, there exists an obstruction Ao = {ao0, a1, . . . , ad}, where a0 ao0 < b0. Since 1 < 2 < x, y in the ordering

THE TWO HIGHER STASHEFF­TAMARI ORDERS ARE EQUAL

29

on [m - 1]v+, by our choice of x and y from Corollary 3.14, we must have that a0 = a0 = 1 and b0 = b0 = 2, and so bo0 = b0 = 1 and Ao = A. This means that A  °e(T ), and so A  °e(T [x  v  y]). This contradicts the fact that U 2 T [x  v  y].
(c) The case where C((A  B  y) \ v, 2d + 1) is a subpolytope of T and v  A  B is analogous to the previous case.
(d) We finally suppose that C((A  B)v+, 2d) is a subpolytope of T , where v  A  B. We label the vertices of this subpolytope by H = {h1, h2, . . . , h2d+3}. From what we deduced about the first and last values of A and B, we know that h1 = 1, h2 = 2, h2d+2 = m - 2, h2d+3 = m - 1. We know that the triangulation of this subpolytope contains an internal d-simplex A such that A[x  v  y] = A. Since 1 < 2 < x, y in the order on [m - 1]v+, we must have that a0 = a0 = 1. Moreover, we must have that A  {h1, h2, . . . , h2d+2}, since ad < bd.
Using the notation of Lemma 3.1, there are two cases to consider, depending upon whether the triangulation of C(H, 2d) is Th2i for i such that 2 i d + 1, or Th2i-1 for i such that 1 i d + 1. The triangulations Th2 and Th2d+3 are excluded because they do not contain any internal simplices with 1 as a vertex, while we know that a0 = 1.
If the triangulation of C(H, 2d) is Th2i for i > 1, then, by Lemma 3.1, there exists an increasing flip given by replacing J = {h1, h3, . . . , h2i-3, h2i, h2i+2, . . . , h2d+2} with K = {h2, h4, . . . , h2i-2, h2i+1, h2i+3, . . . , h2d+3}. Since h1 = 1 and h2 = 2, if this flip is obstructed, it must be because J  °e(T ). If this is the case, then by Lemma 3.12, we have that {h1, h2, . . . , h2i-3, h2i-2, h2i, h2i+1, . . . , h2d+2} is a 2d-simplex of T . But we must have A  {h1, h2, . . . , h2i-3, h2i-2, h2i, h2i+1, . . . , h2d+2}, since A  °e(Th2i ), and so h2i-1 / A. This means that A  °e(T ), which implies that A  °e(T [x  v  y]). This contradicts the fact that U 2 T [x  v  y], and so we conclude that the increasing flip given by replacing J with K cannot be obstructed. Hence if T  is the triangulation resulting from this flip, then we have T 1 T  2 T . The case where the triangulation of C(H, 2d) is Th2i-1 for i 1 behaves similarly. Thus, in all cases we are able to construct a triangulation T  such that T 1 T  2 T , as desired.

3.4. One parity suffices. We conclude this section by noting that it suffices to show explicitly that the two orders are equal for one of either odd dimensions or even dimensions. The other parity can then be deduced for the parity that has been shown explicitly, in a similar manner to the method used in [Wil20b]. This provides a shorter proof than giving an explicit proof for both parities. We submit that it is nevertheless worthwhile to have explicit proofs for both parities, as given in Section 3.2 and Section 3.3.

In particular, one can use the the extension operation from [Ram97], which was explained in Section 2.4. This operation provides a triangulation T^ of C(m+1, +1) from a triangulation T of C(m, ). This can be used to deduce S1(m, ) = S2(m, ) from S1(m + 1,  + 1) = S2(m + 1,  + 1). Our first task is to show that the extension operation (-^ ) is order-reversing with respect to the second order. It is already known that this extension operation is order-reversing with respect to the first order [Ram97]. Of course, if one has already shown that the two orders are equal, then it is immediate from this that extension is order-reversing with respect to the second order. But we are supposing that one has not shown this and are demonstrating how this result may be used to deduce the equivalence of the orders for one parity from the equivalence of the orders for the other parity. To show that extension is order-reversing for even dimensions, we explicitly describe °e(T^ ) in terms of °e(T ).

Lemma 3.16. Let T  S(m, 2d). Then
°e(T^ ) = °e(T ) := { A  Jdm+1 : {a0, . . . , ad-1, ad}  °e(T ) for ad ad }.
Proof. We show that the inclusion holds both ways. Let A  °e(T^ ). Then A  Jdm+1 and there exists a (2d + 1)-simplex S of T^ which possesses A as a face. If S = S  {m + 1} for S a 2d-simplex of T , then we must have A  S, since ad = m + 1, as A  Jdm+1. Then it is immediate that A  °e(T ). Alternatively, we could have that S = S  {l, l + 1}, where S = {s0, . . . , s2d-1}, with S = {s0, . . . , s2d} a 2dsimplex of T for some s2d such that s2d-1 < l < s2d. If ad / {l, l+1}, then A is a face of S and so is straightforwardly in °e(T ). If ad  {l, l + 1}, then {a0, . . . , ad-1, s2d} is a face of S and so {a0, . . . , ad-1, s2d}  °e(T ), noting that a0 2, which means that {a0, . . . , ad-1, s2d} remains an internal d-simplex if s2d = m. Then A  °e(T ), since ad  {l, l + 1} and l + 1 s2d.
Conversely, suppose that A  °e(T ). If A  °e(T ), then it is straightforwardly the case that A  °e(T^ ), since every d-simplex of T is a d-simplex of T^ . Hence, suppose that {a0, . . . , ad-1, ad}  °e(T ), where ad < ad. Then there exists a 2d-simplex S = {a0, q0, a1, q1, a2, . . . , ad-1, qd-1, ad} of T by [OT12, Proposition 2.13]. We can assume that qd-1 < ad, since otherwise we can replace {a0, . . . , ad-1, ad} with {a0, . . . , ad-1, qd-1} and repeat the argument. Then, by definition of T^ , we have that
{a0, q0, a1, q1, a2, . . . , ad-1, qd-1, ad, ad + 1} is a (2d + 1)-simplex of T^ , since qd-1 < ad < ad. We then obtain that A  °e(T^ ), as desired.
This explicit description of °e(T^ ) for an even-dimensional triangulation T allows us to show that the extension operation (-^ ) is order-reversing with respect to the
second order for even-dimensions.

Lemma 3.17. Let T , T   S(m, 2d) with T 2 T . Then T^  2 T^ .

Proof. We prove the contrapositive. Let T , T   S(m, 2d) and suppose that T^  2 T^ . Then there exists A  °e(T^ ) \ °e(T^ ). Since A / °e(T^ ), there exists a (d + 1)-simplex B of T^  such that A  B. We claim that B := {b0, . . . , bd}  °e(T ). Indeed, B must be a face of some (2d + 1)-simplex S. If S = S  {m + 1} for a 2d-simplex S of T , then the claim is clear since B  S. The other option is that S = S  {l, l + 1} for S = {s0, . . . , s2d-1} with S = {s0, . . . , s2d} a 2d-simplex of T and s2d-1 < l < s2d. But here we cannot have that bd = l and bd+1 = l + 1, since bd < ad < bd+1. Hence B  S  S, and so we again have that B  °e(T ). Then, by Lemma 3.16, we have that A = {a0, . . . , ad-1, ad}  °e(T ) for ad ad. Hence we have that B  A, which implies that T 2 T .
For odd dimensions we do not explicitly describe °e(T^ ) in terms of °e(T ), but instead prove that the extension operation (-^ ) is order-reversing with respect to
the second order without this intermediate step.

Lemma 3.18. Let T , T   S(m, 2d + 1) with T 2 T . Then T^  2 T^ .
Proof. We again prove the contrapositive. Suppose that T^  2 T^ . Then there exists B  °e(T^ ) and A  °e(T^ ) such that B  A. We consider how A and B relate to T  and T . We have that B is a face of some (2d + 2)-simplex S of T^ . If S = S  m + 1 for S a (2d + 1)-simplex of T , then B  S, since bd+1 = m + 1, as B  A. Hence, in this case B is a (d + 1)-simplex of T . In the other case, we have that S = S  {l, l + 1} with {s0, . . . , s2d, s2d+1} a (2d + 1)-simplex of T where s2d < l < s2d+1 and S = {s0, . . . , s2d}. Here, we must have that {b0, . . . , bd}  S, since bd+1 = bd + 1, as bd < ad < bd+1. If bd+1  {l, l + 1}, then we let bd+1 = s2d+1, nothing that this means bd+1 bd+1, again because B  A. Hence, in either case, we have that {b0, . . . , bd, bd+1} is a (d + 1)-simplex of T for bd+1 bd+1.
Similarly, we have that {a0, . . . , ad+1} is a face of some (2d + 2)-simplex U of T^ . It can be seen that we must have {a0, . . . , ad}  °e(T ), whatever form the simplex U takes, since ad can neither be the final vertex of U nor the penultimate vertex, as ad < bd+1 < ad+1. But then {a0, . . . , ad} / °e(T ), since we have {a0, . . . , ad}  {b0, . . . , bd, bd+1}. Hence T 2 T .
Thus, we obtain that the extension operation from T to T^ is order-reversing
with respect to the second order for both odd dimensions and even dimensions.

Corollary 3.19. If T , T   S(m, ) with T 2 T , then T^  2 T^ .

This allows us to show that the equality of the orders for  can be deduced from the equality of the orders for  + 1.

Proposition 3.20. If S1(m,  + 1) = S2(m,  + 1) for all m, then S1(m, ) = S2(m, ) for all m.

32

NICHOLAS J. WILLIAMS

Proof. Let T , T   S(m, ) such that T <2 T . We consider the extended triangulations T^ , T^  of C(m + 1,  + 1). These are such that T^ \(m + 1) = T and T^ \(m + 1) = T . We have that T^  <2 T^ by Corollary 3.19. By assumption, S1(m,  + 1) = S2(m,  + 1), so we know that there exists a sequence of increasing flips
T^  = U0 1 U1 1 · · · 1 Uk = T^ .
We claim that, for any given i, we either have Ui+1\(m + 1) = Ui\(m + 1) or Ui+1\(m + 1) 1 Ui\(m + 1). We know that there exists a subpolytope C(S, 2d + 1) of Ui such that the increasing flip from Ui to Ui+1 replaces the lower triangulation of this subpolytope with its upper triangulation. If m + 1 / S, then Ui+1\(m + 1) = Ui\(m + 1), since no (2d + 1)-simplices of Ui with m + 1 as a vertex are affected by the increasing flip. If m + 1  S, then C(S \ (m + 1), ) is a subpolytope of Ui\(m + 1) with the induced triangulation given by its upper triangulation, since the operation \m is order-reversing. Then Ui+1\(m + 1) is the result of replacing the upper triangulation of C(S \ (m + 1), 2d) by its lower triangulation, and so we have that Ui+1\(m + 1) 1 Ui\(m + 1).
Hence, we obtain a sequence of increasing flips
T = Tl 1 Tl-1 1 · · · 1 T0 = T ,
where T0, . . . , Tl consist of U0\(m + 1), . . . , Uk\(m + 1) with the duplicates removed. This shows that T 1 T , and so that S1(m, ) = S2(m, ).
This proposition allows one to deduce the equality of the higher Stasheff­Tamari orders for even dimensions from the equality for odd dimensions, and vice versa.

4. Expanding triangulations
We now wish to prove Lemma 3.4 and Lemma 3.5. To do this, we need to understand the set of triangulations T which transform into T under some contraction. In particular, we need to understand what the pre-image of a subpolytope of T looks like within T . We need to rule out the possibility that this pre-image is a strange collection of simplices which does not itself triangulate a subpolytope.
The pre-images of triangulations under the contraction [m - 1  m] are wellunderstood due to [RS00, Lemma 4.7(i)], which states that such triangulations T are in bijection with sections of the vertex figure T \(m - 1). By symmetry, one can apply the same theory for contractions [1  2]. In this section we show how one can extend the theory to all contractions, that is, for any contraction [x  v  y] of C([m - 1]v+, ). This general case is more challenging, because the vertex figures of C(m - 1, ) are less well-behaved at vertices which are not 1 or m - 1. Considering this general case is necessary for proving Lemma 3.5.

THE TWO HIGHER STASHEFF­TAMARI ORDERS ARE EQUAL

33

We also adopt the opposite perspective to contraction, where we think of the triangulation T of expanding to T . Under this perspective, we are trying to understand the triangulations T of C(m, ) to which T can expand when one expands the cyclic polytope C(m - 1, ) at a particular vertex. The question then becomes how subpolytopes of T behave under expansion.

4.1. Expansion at the first or last vertex. We begin by illustrating how the theory of [RS00, Lemma 4.7(i)] works, and then show how it can be used to prove Lemma 3.4. The result [RS00, Lemma 4.7(i)] states that, given a triangulation T  S(m - 1, ), triangulations T of C(m, ) such that T [m - 1  m] = T are in bijection with sections of the vertex figure T \(m - 1). This bijection operates as follows.

T  S(m, ), T [m-1  m] = T

 { Sections W of T \(m - 1) }

T

- T \{m - 1, m}

T   W  {m - 1, m}

 T \(m - 1)+  (m - 1)

W

-

 T \(m - 1)-  m

Here · T  is the set of -simplices of T which contain neither m - 1 nor m as a vertex. · T \(m - 1)+ is the set of ( - 1)-simplices S of T \(m - 1) such that |S|-1 is above |W|-1 with respect to the ( - 1)-th coordinate. · T \(m - 1)- is the set of ( - 1)-simplices S of T \(m - 1) such that |S|-1 is below |W|-1 with respect to the ( - 1)-th coordinate.
Note that the sets T \(m - 1)+ and T \(m - 1)- are defined with respect to a geometric realisation. Recall that T \(m - 1) is a triangulation of C(m - 2,  - 1), so our geometric realisation is | - |-1. These sets, of course, do not depend upon the particular geometric realisation of C(m - 2,  - 1) given by the choice of points on the moment curve.
We now demonstrate how this result works, using an example.

Example 4.1. We consider the triangulation T of C(5, 3) with 3-simplices {1234, 1245, 2345}. Here we abbreviate by writing the simplices as strings, so that 1234 = {1, 2, 3, 4}. The triangulations T of C(6, 3) such that T [5  6] = T are in bijection with the sections of the triangulation T \5. We have that T \5 is a triangulation of C(4, 2) which can be realised geometrically as the triangulation of the vertex figure of C(5, 3) at |5|. The triangulations |T | and |T \5| are illustrated in Figure 7.
The triangulation T \5 has three sections W1, W2, W3, which are illustrated in Figure 8. By [RS00, Lemma 4.7(i)], these sections correspond to triangulations

T1, T2, T3 of C(6, 3) such that Ti[5  6] = T , and Ti = T   (Wi  {5, 6})  (T \5+  5)  (T \5-  6.)
Hence one may compute that T1 = {1234}  {1256, 2356, 3456}  {1245, 2345}  , T2 = {1234}  {1256, 2456}  {1245}  {2346}, T3 = {1234}  {1456}    {1246, 2346}.
We now show how one may apply the result of [RS00, Lemma 4.7] to prove Lemma 3.4.
Proof of Lemma 3.4. As above, by [RS00, Lemma 4.7(i)], triangulations T of C(m, ) such that T [m - 1  m] = T are in bijection with sections W of T \m - 1. Moreover, given a section W of T \m - 1, the corresponding triangulation T has the set of -simplices
T   (W  {m - 1, m})  (T \m - 1+  (m - 1))  (T \m - 1-  m).
The set-up of Lemma 3.4 gives us that T contains a cyclic subpolytope C(H, ). Let TH be the induced triangulation of the subpolytope C(H, ) in T . If m-1 / H, then we have TH  T , so that C(H, ) is a subpolytope of T . Hence, assume that

THE TWO HIGHER STASHEFF­TAMARI ORDERS ARE EQUAL

35

m - 1  H. This means that C(H \ m - 1, ) is a subpolytope of T \m - 1, with induced triangulation TH \m - 1. There are then three options:
(1) The subpolytope C(H \ m - 1, ) lies below the section |W|. (2) The C(H \ m - 1, ) lies above the section |W|. (3) The section |W| intersects C(H \ m - 1, ). In case (1), we have that TH \m - 1  T \m - 1-, so that C((H \ m - 1)  m, ) is a subpolytope of T . In case (2), we reason similarly that C(H, ) is a subpolytope of T . For case (3), we have that W induces a section WH of TH \m - 1. By [RS00, Lemma 4.7(i)], we have that the section WH of TH gives us a triangulation TH of C(H  m, ). Moreover, the triangulation TH of C(H  m, ) has simplices
TH  (WH  {m - 1, m})  (TH \m - 1+  (m - 1))  (TH \m - 1-  m).
It is then clear that TH  T , WH  W, TH \m-1+  T \m-1+, and TH \m-1-  T \m - 1-. Hence TH is a subtriangulation of T , which gives us that C(H  m, ) is a subpolytope of T .

However, we also wish to prove the analogue of Lemma 3.4 for expansion at vertices other than 1 and m, namely Lemma 3.5. The difficulty is that [RS00, Lemma 4.7(i)] does not apply to these other vertices. Nevertheless, we consider the following example, which suggests that a version of [RS00, Lemma 4.7(i)] ought to hold at these vertices too. We spend most of the remainder of this section proving this more general version of [RS00, Lemma 4.7(i)], which we then use to prove Lemma 3.5.

Example 4.2. We proceed in the opposite direction to Example 4.1. That is, we consider the same triangulation T of C(5, 3), but now directly compute the triangulations T of C([5]2+, 3) such that T [x  2  y] = T . We then analyse the triangulated vertex figure T \2 to see if there is a correspondence.
By direct computation, there are four triangulations T of C([5]2+, 3) such that T [x  2  y] = T , namely
T1 =   {1xy3, xy35}  {1x34, 1x45, x345}  , T2 =   {1xy3, xy34, xy45}  {1x34, 1x45}  {y345}, T3 =   {1xy4, xy45}  {1x45}  {1y34, y345}, T4 =   {1xy5}    {1y34, 1y45, y345}.
Here we have split up the simplices into sets according to whether they have the vertex x, y, or both. Now let
Wi = { A : A  {x, y}  Ti },

so that

Consider these sets of simplices as subcomplexes of T \2. We obtain the results shown in Figure 10 using geometric realisations. Note further that the simplices of the triangulation Ti which have x as a vertex correspond to the simplices of T \2 which are above the section, and the simplices of the triangulation Ti which possess y as a vertex correspond to the simplices of T \2 which are below the section.

This suggests that there ought to be a version of [RS00, Lemma 4.7(i)] for expansion at vertices v such that 1 < v < m. However, there are several outstanding issues.
(1) The vertex figures C(m, )\v are not generally cyclic polytopes for 1 < v < m, as can be seen from Figure 9 and Figure 10.
(2) It is not clear how to define the orientation on the vertex figure C(m, )\v, that is, how to decide what the upper and lower facets of C(m, )\v are. The orientation of C(5, 3)\2 from Figure 10 may look very natural, with |13| and |35| as lower facets and |15| as the sole upper facet. But it is not clear where this comes from, because |123| is a lower facet of C(5, 3), whereas |125| and |235| are upper facets.
(3) Likewise, it is not clear how to orient the simplices in the triangulation. From Figure 10, it seems that |345| has lower facet |35| and upper facets |34|, |45|, whereas |134| has lower facets |13|, |34| and upper facet |14|. But is not immediately obvious what the basis for this is.
(4) Finally, it is not obvious how to define sections of a triangulation of the vertex figure C(m, )\v. Moreover, if one can define the right notion of a section, it is not clear whether such sections will be triangulations of lowerdimensional cyclic polytopes, given that the vertex figures themselves are not cyclic polytopes.
Over the course of this section we shall show how to resolve all these issues and prove the analogue of [RS00, Lemma 4.7(i)] at vertices which are not 1 or m. We first show how one can orient the vertex figures C(m, )\v, that is, decide which the upper and lower facets of C(m, )\v are. This explains the natural orientation we arrived at in Figure 10, and solves issue (2). Next we apply the same logic to the simplices of the triangulation, thereby answering (3).
This gives us a partial order on the simplices of T \v. Using this, we derive the relevant notion of a section within the triangulation T \v. We show that, in fact, our sections are triangulations of C([m]\v,  -2), solving issue (4). This culminates in our proving the following proposition, which is the analogue of [RS00, Lemma 4.7(i)], showing that point (1) is not a problem.

Proposition 4.3. Let T be a triangulation of C(m, ). There is a bijection between triangulations T of C([m]v+, ) such that T [x  v  y] = T and sections of T \v, given by

T  S([m]v+, ),  { Sections W of T \v } T [x  v  y] = T

T -
T   (W  {x, y}) (T \v+  x)(T \v-  y)

T \{x, y} W.

Remark 4.4. It suffices to prove Proposition 4.3 for  odd. For  even it already follows from [RS00, Lemma 4.7(i)], since in this case the cyclic permutation i  i + (m - v) defines an automorphism of C(m, ) which sends vertex v to vertex m, see [KW03]. Hence one may apply [RS00, Lemma 4.7(i)] to the vertex v as if it were vertex m, which gives Proposition 4.3 in this case. But for  odd this permutation does not define an automorphism, and so more work needs to be done. Indeed, the fact that, for  odd and v  [2, m - 1], C(m, )\v is not a cyclic polytope precludes this permutation from giving an automorphism.
The methods of this section may still be applied to even-dimensional cyclic polytopes. One can check that this is equivalent to considering C(m, 2d) subject to the given automorphism. However, restricting our attention to  odd allows us to simplify some proofs.

Proving Proposition 4.3 requires theory for working with triangulated vertex figures and their sections. Developing this theory is the task of Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5. The purpose of everything we prove in these sections is ultimately to derive Proposition 4.3, and in turn to apply this proposition to prove Lemma 3.5.

Remark 4.5. Proposition 4.3 and [RS00, Lemma 4.7(i)] are reminiscent of the singleelement extension theorem of Las Vergnas for oriented matroids [Las78] [Bj¨o+99, Section 7.1] [RZ94, Theorem 4.1.(1)]. However, it does not seem that they follow from this result in any obvious way.

4.2. Facets of vertex figures. Our first task is to find the correct orientation of the vertex figure C(m, 2d + 1)\v, so that we divide its facets into lower facets and upper facets. It is important to note that, as in Example 4.2, this will not generally match the orientation of C(m, 2d + 1). That is to say, if F is a lower facet of C(m, 2d + 1)\v according to our orientation, then F  v will not generally be a lower facet of C(m, 2d + 1).
Recall from Gale's Evenness Criterion that a facet F of C(m, 2d + 1) can be expressed uniquely as a union of disjoint pairs of consecutive numbers along either with 1 or m. Hence, given v  [2, m - 1], and a facet F of C(m, ) such that v  F , we can talk about the pair of consecutive entries that v lies in, which must either be {v - 1, v} or {v, v + 1}. We define the upper and lower facets of C(m, 2d + 1)\v as follows.

Definition 4.6. Let v  [2, m - 1] and let F be a facet of C(m, 2d + 1) such that v  F . Then F \ v is a facet of C(m, 2d + 1)\v.
· If the other element in the pair with v in F is v + 1, then we say that F \ v is an lower facet of C(m, 2d + 1)\v.
· If the other element in the pair with v in F is v - 1, then we say that F \ v is an upper facet of C(m, 2d + 1)\v.

THE TWO HIGHER STASHEFF­TAMARI ORDERS ARE EQUAL

The following lemma indicates why our orientation of the vertex figure C(m, 2d+ 1)\v is the correct one when it comes to considering expansion. A lower facet F of C(m, 2d + 1)\v should always lie below the section, and hence should always become a facet F  y of C([m]v+, 2d + 1).
Lemma 4.7. We have that F is a lower facet of C(m, 2d + 1)\v if and only if F  y is a facet of C([m]v+, 2d + 1). Dually, we have that F is an upper facet of C(m, 2d + 1)\v if and only if F  x is a facet of C([m]v+, 2d + 1).
Proof. If F  v is an even subset of [m] and v is in a pair with v + 1, then F  y will be an even subset of [m]v+. Conversely, if F  y is either an even or an odd subset of [m]v+ where F  [m] \ v, then y must be in a pair with v + 1, since x / F . Consequently F  v is either an even or an odd subset of [m] with v in a pair with v + 1. The analogous claim for upper facets follows by a similar argument.

One can also describe the upper and lower facets of C(m, 2d + 1)\v using the following, which can be seen as a generalisation of Gale's Evenness Criterion.

Lemma 4.8. Let F  [m] \ v. Then
· F is a lower facet of C(m, 2d + 1)\v if and only if #{ i  F : j < i < v } is even for all j  [v - 1] \ F and #{ i  F : v < i < j } is odd for all j  [v + 1, m] \ F ; and
· F is an upper facet of C(m, 2d + 1)\v if and only if #{ i  F : j < i < v } is odd for all j  [v - 1] \ F and #{ i  F : v < i < j } is even for all j  [v + 1, m] \ F .

Proof. We only show the first claim, since the second claim is similar. Suppose that F is a lower facet of C(m, 2d + 1)\v. Then F  v is a facet of C(m, 2d + 1) and v occurs in a pair with v + 1. Let j  [v - 1] \ F . There are then a whole number of pairs of consecutive numbers between j and v, so #{ i  [m] : j < i < v } is even. Let j  [v + 1, m] \ F . Then the elements of F between j and v consist of v + 1 and a set of pairs of consecutive numbers, so #{ i  [m] : v < i < j } is odd.
Suppose now that F is such that #{ i  [m] : j < i < v } is even for all j  [v - 1] \ F and #{ i  [m] : v < i < j } is odd for all j  [v + 1, m] \ F . Then we must have v + 1  F , since otherwise we can choose j = v + 1, and #{ i  [m] : v < i < v + 1 } = 0. The remaining elements of F must consist of disjoint pairs of consecutive numbers and possibly 1 or m, otherwise we can find gaps in F which contradict our assumption. Moreover, F cannot contain both 1 and m, since F must have 2d + 1 elements. This gives that F  v is a facet of C(m, 2d + 1) where v occurs in a pair with v + 1. Hence F is a lower facet of C(m, 2d + 1)\v.
The following lemma describes the significance of the intersections of upper and lower facets of the vertex figure C(m, )\v. It is analogous to the easily-verified

40

fact that the facets of C(m, ) correspond precisely to the ( - 1)-simplices which are intersections of a lower facet and an upper facet of C(m,  + 1).

Lemma 4.9. If G 

[m]\v 2d-1

and G = F F , where F is an upper facet of C(m, 2d+

1)\v and F  is a lower facet of C(m, 2d+1)\v, then G is a facet of C([m]\v, 2d-1).

Proof. Let
j = max{ i  [m] \ F : i < v },
j = max{ i  [m] \ F  : i < v },
k = min{ i  [m] \ F : v < i },
k = min{ i  [m] \ F  : v < i }.
We cannot have j = j, since #{ i  F : j < i < v } is odd, whereas #{ i  F  : j < i < v } is even. Therefore, suppose that j < j. This implies that j  F , so that F = G  j. Hence, k / F , so that k < k and F  = G  k.
Then #{ i  G : j < i < v } = #{ i  F  : j < i < v }, which is even, and #{ i  G : v < i < k } = #{ i  F : v < i < k }, which is also even. Furthermore, #{ i  G : j < i < j } is even, since #{ i  F : j < i < v } is odd and #{ i  F  : j < i < v } is even. Similarly, #{ i  G : k < i < k } is even.
Thus, G  [1, j] consists of a set of disjoint pairs along with possibly 1, since this is true of F and F ; G[j, j] is an interval of even length; G[j, k] is an interval in [m]\ v of even length; G[k, k] is an interval of even length; and G[k, m] consists of a disjoint union of pairs, along with possibly m. Consequently, G satisfies Gale's Evenness Criterion, and so is a facet of C([m] \ v, 2d + 1). The case where j < j is similar.

Corollary 4.10. If G = F  F , where F is an upper facet of C(m, 2d + 1)\v and F  is a lower facet of C(m, 2d + 1)\v, then G  {x, y} is a facet of C([m]v+, 2d + 1).
Proof. This follows from Gale's Eveness Criterion and Lemma 4.9. If G is an even (respectively, odd) subset of [m] \ v, then G  {x, y} is an even (respectively, odd) subset of [m]v+. Adding a pair of consecutive entries cannot change the parities of any gaps.

4.3. Orienting the simplices. We now show how one can similarly orient the simplices of the triangulation T \v, which allows us to introduce a partial order on these simplices.
We first explain the logic of our orientation of the simplices of T \v. Given a triangulation T of C(m - 1, 2d + 1), we wish to understand the different triangulations T of C([m - 1]v+, 2d + 1) such that T [x  v  y] = T . We consider the triangulated vertex figure T \v. It is clear that T \v contains T \{x, y} as a simplicial subcomplex. We would like to think of these simplicial subcomplexes as

THE TWO HIGHER STASHEFF­TAMARI ORDERS ARE EQUAL

41

sections which divide T \v into a part where x  v under expansion and a part where v  y under expansion.
However, it is not clear geometrically which part of T \v lies above T \{x, y} and which part lies below. Hence, we look to characterise this combinatorially instead. Note that for every 2d-simplex S of T \v, we must have that S  v is a simplex of T , so that S  x is a (2d + 1)-simplex of T , or that S  y is a (2d + 1)-simplex of T . But we cannot have both, since S  {x, y} can be decomposed into two halves of a circuit, one of which is contained in S  x, and the other of which is contained in S  y, since x and y are adjacent in S  {x, y}. We therefore orient the simplices of the triangulated vertex figure T \v as follows.

Definition 4.11. Let S be a 2d-simplex of T \v. Then S  {x, y} consists of 2d + 3 distinct vertices, and so uniquely gives two halves of a circuit of C([m]v+, 2d + 1), which we denote (S-  x, S+  y). Then we say that S \ s is an lower facet of S if s  S+, and an upper facet of S if s  S-.
One can also translate this definition of the upper and lower facets of simplices of T \v into an evenness criterion, which can be deduced straightforwardly from the definition.

Lemma 4.12. Let S be a 2d-simplex of T \v and let s  S. Then
(1) if s < v, then S \ s is (a) a lower facet of S if #{ i  S : s < i < v } is even, and (b) an upper facet of S if #{ i  S : s < i < v } is odd;
(2) if v < s, then S \ s is (a) a lower facet of S if #{ i  S : v < i < s } is odd, and (b) an upper facet of S if #{ i  S : v < i < s } is even.

By comparing with Lemma 4.8, we see that our notion of the upper and lower facets of a simplex of T \v matches our notion of the upper and lower facets of C(m, 2d + 1)\v.

Lemma 4.13. Let T be a triangulation of C(m, 2d + 1). Let S, R be 2d-simplices of T \v. Then S  R cannot be both a lower facet of S and a lower facet of R. Similarly, S  R cannot be both an upper facet of S and an upper facet of R.

Proof. We only show the first claim, since the second claim is similar. Suppose that F is both a lower facet of S = F  s and a lower facet of R = F  r. Without loss of generality, assume that s < r. If s < r < v or v < s < r, then are are an even number of elements f  F such that s < f < r, by Lemma 4.12. If s < v < r, then there are an odd number of elements f  F such that s < f < r, by Lemma 4.12.
We have #F  {s, r, v} = 2d + 3, and so there is a circuit (Z, Z) of C(m, 2d + 1) such that Z  Z = F  {s, r, v}. Suppose, without loss of generality, that s  Z. By the previous paragraph, we must then have r  Z. Hence the simplices F  {s, v}

42

and F  {r, v} each contain one half of a circuit, which contradicts their both being simplices of T .

In the manner of [Ram97, Definition 5.7], we may now define a relation on the set of 2d-simplices of T \v. Given two 2d-simplices S, R, we write that S v R if and
v
only if S  R is an upper facet of S and a lower facet of R. We show that is a

partial order using the method of [Ram97, Corollary 5.8]: we define a total order
v
on the simplices of T \v and show that is a sub-order of it. This means that every

triangulation of C(m, 2d + 1)\v which comes from a triangulation of C(m, 2d + 1)

is stackable, in the sense of [RS00, Definition 2.13].

To each S

we

We then denote by

the lexicographic order on

ordering of the letters o    e.

Lemma 4.14. Let T be a triangulation of C(m, 2d + 1) and consider the triangulated vertex figure T \v. Let S and R be 2d-simplices of T \v such that S v R, with S \ {s} = R \ {r}.
(1) If we have v < s < r in the cyclic ordering, then r(S) = e and s(R) = e. (2) If we have v < r < s in the cyclic ordering, then r(S) = o and s(r) = o. (3) For j / S  R, we have that j(S) = j(R) if and only if j lies between s
and r in the ordering v + 1, . . . , n, 1, . . . , v - 1. Proof. By Lemma 4.12, the fact that S v R implies that
if s < v, then #{ i  S : s < i < v } is odd, and if v < s, then #{ i  S : v < i < s } is even,
and
if r < v, then #{ i  R : r < i < v } is even, and if v < r, then #{ i  R : v < i < r } is odd.
We consider the case where v < s < r is a cyclic ordering.

THE TWO HIGHER STASHEFF­TAMARI ORDERS ARE EQUAL

43

(1) Within this set of cases, we first suppose that v < s < r. Then

#{ i  R : v < i < s } = #{ i  S : v < i < s },

which is even, and

#{ i  S : v < i < r } = #{ i  R : v < i < r } + 1,

which is even. Therefore s(R) = e and r(S) = e. Moreover, if j / S  R, then j(S) = j(R) if and only if s < j < r in the cyclic ordering.
(2) If r < v < s, then

#{ i  R : v < i < s } = #{ i  S : v < i < s },

which is even, and

#{ i  S : r < i < v } = #{ i  R : r < i < v },

which is even. Therefore s(R) = e and r(S) = e. Moreover, if j / S  R, then j(S) = j(R) if and only if s < j < r in the cyclic ordering.
(3) If s < r < v, then

#{ i  R : s < i < v } = #{ i  S : s < i < v } - 1,

which is even, and

#{ i  S : r < i < v } = #{ i  R : r < i < v },

which is even. Therefore s(R) = e and r(S) = e. Moreover, if j / S  R, then j(S) = j(R) if and only if s < j < r in the cyclic ordering.

The cases where v < r < s is a cyclic ordering are similar.

v
Corollary 4.15. The relation is a partial order.

v
Proof. We show that S R implies that S R. For this it suffices to show that S v R implies that S R. If v < s < r in the cyclic ordering, then, by

Lemma 4.14(3), it suffices to consider s(S) and s(R) in order to compare (S) and (R) in the lexicographic order, since this is the first entry that differs. Then

we have s(S) =  and s(R) = e by Lemma 4.14(1) so that S R. Similarly, if

v < r < s in the cyclic ordering, then we consider r(S) = o and r(R) = , so that

v

v

S R likewise. We conclude that S R implies that S R. This entails that

is a partial order, since is a total order.

Recall that L is a lower set for a partial order on a set P if L is a subset of P such that whenever p  L and p p, we also have p  L. The notion of an upper set of a partial order is defined dually. These concepts, together with our partial
v
order , allow us to characterise the set of simplices in T \v where x  v under expansion and the set of simplices where v  y under expansion.

Lemma 4.16. Let T be a triangulation of C(m, 2d + 1) with T a triangulation of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) such that T [x  v  y] = T . Let L be the set of 2d-simplices S of T \v such that S  y is a (2d + 1)-simplex of T and let U be the set of 2d-simplices
v
R of T \v such that R  x is a (2d + 1)-simplex of T . Then L is a lower set for ,
v
U is an upper set for , and L  U = T \v, with L  U = .

Proof. It is clear that L  U must comprise all of the 2d-simplices of T \v. This is because if S is a 2d-simplex of T \v, then S  v is a (2d + 1)-simplex of T , and so either S  x or S  y is a (2d + 1)-simplex of T . Then, as we argued earlier, we cannot have L  U = , since then both S  x and S  y are (2d + 1)-simplices of T . But this is prevented by the circuit (S-  x, S+  y) of Definition 4.11, as S  x  S-  x and S  y  S+  y.
v
We now show that L is a lower set for . We suppose that R  L and S  T \v are such that S v R. Let F = S  R, which is an upper facet of S and a lower facet of R. Suppose for contradiction that S  x is a (2d + 1)-simplex of T . Then F  x is a 2d-simplex of T . Since F is a lower facet of R, we have that F  x  R-  x, where (R-  x, R+  y) is the circuit from Definition 4.11. Since R  L, we have that R  y  T . But then, R  y  R+  y, so that both halves of (R-  x, R+  y) are contained in simplices of T , which is a contradiction. Hence L is a lower set, which also implies that U is an upper set.
4.4. Sections of vertex figures. We now show how our partial order on the 2dsimplices of T \v allows us to define the notion of a section of T \v. We then prove fundamental properties of sections of T \v which will enable us to prove that they are in bijection with triangulations T of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) such that T [x  v  y] = T .
v
Definition 4.17. Given a lower set L of (T \v, ), we let U = (T \v) \ L be the upper set which is its complement, and define the associated section W(L) to be the abstract simplicial complex given by the set of (2d - 1)-simplices W of T \v such that either
· W = A  B where A  L and B  U, or · W is an upper facet of C(m, 2d + 1)\v and an upper facet of A  L, or · W is a lower facet of C(m, 2d + 1)\v and a lower facet of B  U.

Sections of T \v are triangulations of C([m] \ v, 2d - 1), just as sections of T \m are triangulations of C(m - 1,  - 2) for triangulations T of C(m, ).

Lemma 4.18. For a triangulation T of C(m, 2d + 1), sections of T \v are triangulations of C([m] \ v, 2d - 1).

Proof. We prove the claim by induction on #L. In the base case, we have that L = , so that W(L) = Fvl ([m] \ v, 2d + 1). Hence, we must show that Fvl ([m] \ v, 2d + 1) is a triangulation of C([m] \ v, 2d - 1). We must first show that there is no circuit (A, B) of C([m] \ v, 2d - 1) such that A and B are both faces of simplices in

THE TWO HIGHER STASHEFF­TAMARI ORDERS ARE EQUAL

45

Fvl ([m] \ v, 2d + 1). If this were the case, then either (A  x, B  y) or (A  y, B  x) would be a circuit of C([m]v+, 2d + 1). But this contradicts Lemma 4.7, which gives that A  y and B  y must be contained in lower facets of C([m]v+, 2d + 1), which cannot contain halves of circuits.
We now show that the facets of the (2d - 1)-simplices in Fvl ([m] \ v, 2d + 1) are either shared with other (2d - 1)-simplices of Fvl ([m] \ v, 2d + 1), or are facets of C([m] \ v, 2d - 1). Let S  Fvl ([m] \ v, 2d + 1) and let s  S, so that S \ s is a facet of S. We have that S  v is a facet of C(m, 2d + 1), so we must have that
(S \ s)  v = (S  v)  (R  v) for a facet R  v of C(m, 2d + 1). Hence S \ s = S  R for a facet R  Fv([m] \ v, 2d + 1). If R  Fvl ([m] \ v, 2d + 1), then we are done. Otherwise, R  Fvu([m]\v, 2d+1), and so S \s = S R is a facet of C([m]\v, 2d-1) by Lemma 4.9. This establishes the base case.
Now, to show the inductive step, we suppose that we have a section W(L) such
v
that #L = . Choose a simplex S  L which is maximal in L with respect to . Then L := L \ S is a lower set of v and, by the induction hypothesis, W(L) is a
triangulation of C([m] \ v, 2d - 1). It follows from Definition 4.17 and the fact that S is maximal in L that W(L) = (W(L) \ Fvl (S, 2d + 1))  Fvu(S, 2d + 1).
Let Se = {s0, s2, . . . , s2d} and So = {s1, s3, . . . , s2d-1}. Then either (Se  x, So  y) is a circuit of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) or (So  x, Se  y) is a circuit of C([m]v+, 2d + 1). Hence, either Fvl (S, 2d + 1) = { S \ s : s  So } = F u(S, 2d - 1), or Fvl (S, 2d + 1) = { S \ s : s  Se } = F l(S, 2d - 1). Then, respectively, either W(L) = (W(L) \ F u(S, 2d - 1))  F l(S, 2d - 1)) or W(L) = (W(L) \ F l(S, 2d - 1))  F u(S, 2d - 1)). In the former case, W(L) is an increasing bistellar flip of W(L) as a triangulation
of C([m] \ v, 2d - 1); in the latter case, W(L) is a decreasing bistellar flip of W(L)
as a triangulation of C([m] \ v, 2d - 1). Since bistellar flips send triangulations of
C([m] \ v, 2d - 1) to triangulations of C([m] \ v, 2d - 1), we have in either case
that W(L) is a triangulation of C([m] \ v, 2d - 1). The result then follows by
induction.

We obtain the following result, which will be useful in showing how sections of T \v correspond to expanded triangulations.

Corollary 4.19. Let T be a triangulation of C(m, 2d + 1) with W(L) a section of T \v. Then there exists no circuit (A  x, B  y) of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) such that A and B are both simplices in W(L).

Proof. If there were simplices A and B of W(L), such that (A  x, B  y) was a circuit of C([m]v+, 2d + 1), then (A, B) would be a circuit of C([m] \ v, 2d - 1), which would contradict Lemma 4.18.

Referring back to Proposition 4.3, this corollary allows us to show that the simplices W(L)  {x, y} do not contain any circuits. However, we also need to show that there can be no circuits between W(L){x, y} and T \v- y, and W(L){x, y}

46

and T \v+  x, for which we need the following definition and lemma, which uses Corollary 4.19 in its proof. Of course, we also need that there can be no circuits between T \v-  y and T \v+  x, which we subsequently deduce from this.

Definition 4.20. Let T be a triangulation of C(m, 2d + 1) with W(L) a section of T \v and A a simplex of T \v. Then we say that A is submerged by W(L) if A is contained in a simplex of L or a simplex of W(L). Similarly, we say that A is supermerged by W(L) if A is contained in a simplex of U or a simplex of W(L).

These are analogues for vertex figures of C(m, 2d + 1) of the usual notions of submersion and supermersion from [ER96; Wil20a] respectively. These usual notions are defined for C(m, ) by comparing heights with respect to the ( + 1)-th coordinate. For C(m, )\v it is not clear what direction one should use to com-
v
pare heights, so we recreate the notions combinatorially using the partial order . We now prove the following lemma concerning submersion. There is clear intuition behind the result: it should be seen as analogous to one direction of [Wil20a, Proposition 3.7].

Lemma 4.21. Let T be a triangulation of C(m, 2d + 1) with W(L) a section of T \v. Then there exists no circuit (A  x, B  y) of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) such that A is a simplex of W(L) and B is submerged by W(L).

Proof. Suppose for contradiction that we are in the situation described and that there exists a circuit (A  x, B  y) of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) such that A is a simplex of W(L) and B is submerged by W(L).
We show the result by induction on #L. In the base case we have L = , and so both A and B must be simplices of W(L). But this contradicts Corollary 4.19. For the inductive step, we may assume that L = , and so choose S  L which is maximal, so that L := L \ S is a lower set with associated section W(L). By the induction hypothesis, the claim holds for W(L), which is equal to (W(L) \ Fvu(S, 2d + 1))  Fvl (S, 2d + 1).
We have that A is a simplex of W(L) and B is submerged by W(L), but we cannot have this for W(L) by the induction hypothesis. Hence we must either have that A is not a simplex of W(L) or that B is not submerged by W(L). In the latter case, we must have that A is contained in upper facets of S but no lower facets, and in the former case we must have that B is contained in upper facets of S but no lower facets. Note that at most one of these cases can hold, since A and B are disjoint, but in the first case A must contain the intersection of the upper facets of S, whereas in the second case B must contain the intersection of the upper facets of S. We consider each of these cases in turn.
Suppose first that B is contained in upper facets of S but no lower facets. This means that B is a simplex of of W(L). But A is also a simplex of W(L), so that we

THE TWO HIGHER STASHEFF­TAMARI ORDERS ARE EQUAL

47

have a circuit (A  x, B  y) of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) where A and B are both simplices of W(L). This contradicts Corollary 4.19.
Suppose now that A is only contained in upper facets of S. We must have that either A is the intersection of the upper facets of S, or that S has d + 1 upper facets and A is a d-simplex contained in all but one of these facets. Note that this latter case is not possible for triangulations of cyclic polytopes, where 2d-simplices always have d upper facets, but it is possible for triangulations of vertex figures of cyclic polytopes: see the simplex |345| in Figure 10. Simplices of the triangulated vertex figure are sometimes upside-down, as it were.
If A is the intersection of the upper facets of S, then we have that S = J  A where (J  x, A  y) is a circuit of C([m]v+, 2d + 1). If a, b, j are the smallest elements of the respective sets which are greater than v (or simply the smallest if no elements are greater than v), then we have that j < a < b is a cyclic ordering by considering the circuits (J  x, A  y) and (A  x, B  y). We then obtain that ((A\a){j, x}, B y) is a circuit of C([m]v+, 2d+1). This contradicts the induction hypothesis, since B is submerged by W(L) and (A \ a)  j is a simplex of W(L), because it lies in the lower facet S \ a of S.
We now must consider the case where S has d + 1 upper facets and A is a dsimplex contained in all but one of these facets. Hence, let S = J  A = S-  S+, where (S-  x, S+  y) is a circuit and J  A = . By assumption, we have that A  S+, and

#S+ = d,

#S- = d + 1,

#A = d + 1,

#J = d.

This also implies that #B = d. We must have that at least one of s-0 and s-d is not an element of A, since #A  S- = 1. Suppose that s-0 / A; the other case behaves similarly. Here we have s-0 < s+0 = a0 < b0. We then have that ((A \ a0)  {s-0 , x}, B  y) is a circuit of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) with the lower facet S \ a0 of S containing (A \ a0)  s-0 . Thus (A \ a0)  s-0 a simplex of W(L), giving a
contradiction, because B is submerged by W(L). This concludes the proof.

We now apply Lemma 4.21 to prove the following lemma. The intuition here is that if we have that (A  x, B  y) is a circuit of C([m]v+, 2d + 1), then B is "above" A in the triangulated vertex figure T \v, and so there can be no section W(L) of T \v where B is submerged by W(L) and A is supermerged by W(L).

Lemma 4.22. Let T be a triangulation of C(m, 2d + 1) with W(L) a section of T \v. Then there exists no circuit (A  x, B  y) of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) such that A is supermerged by W(L) and B is submerged by W(L).

Proof. Suppose for contradiction that we are in the situation described and that there exists a circuit (A  x, B  y) of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) such that A is supermerged

by W(L) and B is submerged by W(L). Suppose that A is not a face of a simplex of W(L). Then there is a simplex S  U := (T \ v) \ L such that the lower facets of S are all (2d - 1)-simplices of S and none of them contain A as a face. We obtain that L = L  S is also a lower set, with A is still supermerged by W(L) and B is still submerged by W(L). By repeating this process, we may assume that A is a face of a simplex of W(L). But this contradicts Lemma 4.21.
4.5. Expansion at other vertices. We can now derive the main result of this section, namely, that the different triangulations which may result from expansion at vertex v are in bijection with the sections of T \v. We prove our bijection in two halves, showing first that every expanded triangulation gives us a section.

Lemma 4.23. Let T be a triangulation of C(m, 2d + 1) with T a triangulation of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) such that T [x  v  y] = T . Let L be the set of 2d-simplices S of T \v such that S  y is a (2d + 1)-simplex of T . Then W(L) = T \{x, y}.

Proof. To start, note that by Lemma 4.16, the complement U of L in T \v consists of the 2d-simplices S such that S  x is a (2d + 1)-simplex of T .
We first prove that T \{x, y}  W(L). Let W be a (2d - 1)-simplex of T \{x, y}. Then W  {x, y} is a (2d + 1)-simplex of T . We have that W  x is either a facet of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) or a facet of R  x where R  U. Likewise, either W  y is a facet of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) or a facet of S  y where S  L.
Note that we cannot both have that W  x is a facet of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) and that W  y is a facet of C([m]v+, 2d + 1). To see this, suppose that W  x is an upper facet, so that it is an odd subset. This means that x is an even gap in W  y, since, by assumption, y is an odd gap in W  x. Hence, if W  y is a facet of C([m]v+, 2d + 1), then x must be the only gap in W  y, otherwise W  y must have both odd and even gaps. This means that C([m]v+, 2d + 1) is a (2d + 1)-simplex, and so C(m, 2d + 1) is degenerate. The case where W  x is a lower facet is similar.
Hence, we either have that
· W  x is facet of R  x where R  U and W  y is a facet of S  y where S  L, or
· W x is a facet of Rx where R  U and W y is a facet of C([m]v+, 2d+1), or
· W  x is a facet of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) and W  y is a facet of S  y where S  L.
Hence, in all cases W  W(L), by applying Lemma 4.7. We now prove that W(L)  T \{x, y}. Suppose that W is a (2d - 1)-simplex
of W(L). We claim that W  {x, y} is a (2d + 1)-simplex of T . By the following reasoning, we have that both W  x and W  y are 2d-simplices of T .
· If W = R  S where R  L and S  U, then we have that R  y and S  x are (2d + 1)-simplices of T by definition of L and U.

· If W is an upper facet of C(m, 2d + 1)\v and an upper facet of R for R  L, then W x is a 2d-simplex of T by Lemma 4.7 and Ry is a (2d+1)-simplex of T by definition of L.
· If W is a lower facet of C(m, 2d+1)\v and a lower facet of S for S  U, then W  y is a 2d-simplex of T by Lemma 4.7 and R  x is a (2d + 1)-simplex of T by definition of U.
We now show that W  {x, y} is a (2d + 1)-simplex of T by applying [Wil20a, Lemma 4.4], which states that it suffices to check that d- and (d + 1)-faces of W  {x, y} are in T . Let A  W  {x, y} be such that #A = d + 1. If x, y  A, then A lies on the boundary of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) by Gale's Evenness Criterion, so A is a d-simplex of T . If x / A, then A is a d-face of W  y, which we already know is a (2d - 1)-simplex of T . The case where y / A may be treated similarly.
Now let B  W  {x, y} such that #B = d + 2. Every d-face of B is a d-simplex of T , by what we have just argued. If x, y  B, then B cannot be half of a circuit of C([m]v+, 2d + 1), since x and y are consecutive in [m]v+. Applying [Wil20a, Lemma 4.4] then gives that B is a (d + 1)-simplex of T . If, on the other hand, x / B (alternatively, y / B), then B is a (d + 1)-face of W  y (alternatively, W  x), which we know is a 2d-simplex of T . Therefore, by [Wil20a, Lemma 4.4], W {x, y} is a (2d+1)-simplex of T , and so W is a (2d-1)-simplex of T \{x, y}.

We now show the other half of the bijection, namely, that one can construct an expanded triangulation from every section.

Lemma 4.24. Let T be a triangulation of C(m, 2d+1) with W(L) a section of T \v. Then there is a triangulation T of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) such that T [x  v  y] = T and T \{x, y} = W(L).

Proof. Suppose that we are in the situation described and let U be the complement of L in T \v. We define T to consist of the (2d + 1)-simplices
T = T   (W(L)  {x, y})  (U  x)  (L  y),
where T  = { Q : Q  T , v / Q }. It is evident from the definition of T that T [x  v  y] = T and T \{x, y} = W(L). We now show that T is a triangulation of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) by explicitly verifying that it satisfies the combinatorial definition of a triangulation from Section 2.1.3.
We first verify that, for any simplex Q of T and any facet F of Q, either F is a facet of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) or a facet of another (2d + 1)-simplex of T .
(1) Suppose first that Q  T . Then if F is a facet of C(m, 2d + 1) in T , F will be a facet of C([m]v+, 2d + 1) in T . Suppose instead that F is a facet of Q for some simplex Q in T . Then, if v / Q, then Q  T   T . On the other hand, if v  Q, then either (Q \ v)  x or (Q \ v)  y is a (2d + 1)-simplex of T , and F is a facet of either of these.

(2) Suppose now that Q  U  x. If x / F , then Q = F  x. Then F  v is a (2d + 1)-simplex of T , where F is either a facet of C(m, 2d + 1), or a facet of a (2d + 1)-simplex Q, where v / Q. If F is a facet of C(m, 2d + 1), then F is a facet of C([m]v+, 2d + 1). If F is a facet of a (2d + 1)-simplex Q in T , then Q  T , and F is a facet of Q in T . If x  F , then in T \v, F \ x is either a facet of C(m, 2d + 1)\v, or a facet of some 2d-simplex S distinct from Q \ x. We consider these two cases in turn. If F \ x is a facet of C(m, 2d + 1)\v, then it is either a lower facet or an upper facet. In the latter case, by Lemma 4.7, F is a facet of C([m]v+, 2d + 1). In the former case, since F \ x is a facet of Q \ x and Q  U, we have that F \ x is in the section W(L). This then means that F is a facet of the (2d + 1)-simplex (F \ x)  {x, y} in T . If F \ x = (Q \ x)  S for some 2d-simplex S, then either S  U, or S  L. If S  U, then S  x is a (2d + 1)-simplex of T distinct from Q with F as a facet. If S  L, then F \ x  W(L). In this case (F \ x)  {x, y} is a (2d + 1)-simplex of T and it has F as a facet. (3) The case where Q  L  y is similar to the previous case. (4) Finally, suppose that Q  W(L)  {x, y}. If x / F , then Q = F  x. We have that F \ y is a (2d - 1)-simplex of T \v, and is therefore either both a facet of C(m, 2d + 1)\v and a facet of a 2d-simplex S of T \v, or a shared facet of two 2d-simplices R and S of T \v. Note also that F \ y  W(L), since Q  W(L)  {x, y}. If F \ y is both a facet of C(m, 2d + 1)\v and a facet of a 2d-simplex S, then either F \ y is a lower facet or it is an upper facet. If it is a lower facet, then F is a facet of C([m]v+, 2d + 1). If it is an upper facet, then we must have S  L, since F \ y  W(L). Consequently, S  y is a (2d + 1)-simplex of T , and F is a facet of it. If F \ y is a shared facet of two 2d-simplices S and R in T , then we may suppose without loss of generality that S  L and R  U, since we know that F \ y  W(L). We then have that F is a shared facet of Q and S  y in T . The case when y / F is similar to the case where x / F . If x, y  F , then let W = Q \ {x, y}, so that W  W(L). Then G = F \ {x, y} is a facet of W . Since, by Lemma 4.18, W(L) is a triangulation of C([m] \ v, 2d - 1), then there either exists W   W(L) such that W  W  = G, or that G is a facet of C([m] \ v, 2d + 1). In the second case, we are done immediately by applying Corollary 4.10, which gives us that F = G  {x, y} is a facet of C([m]v+, 2d + 1). In the first case, we have that W   {x, y}  W(L)  {x, y} and that F is a shared facet between Q and W   {x, y}.
We must now show that there can be no pair of (2d + 1)-simplices S, R in T such that S  Z- and R  Z+, where (Z-, Z+) is a circuit of C([m]v+, 2d + 1). Suppose for contradiction that there does exist such a pair of (2d + 1)-simplices S and R.

THE TWO HIGHER STASHEFF­TAMARI ORDERS ARE EQUAL

We use the fact that T [x  v  y] = T . This implies that any such circuit (Z-, Z+) must degenerate under the contraction [x  v  y], since otherwise we would obtain a circuit in T . This means that we have x  Z± and y  Z. Hence we only need to consider the cases where
(1) S  U  x and R  L  y; (2) S  U  x and R  W(L)  {x, y}; (3) S  W(L)  {x, y} and R  L  y; and (4) S, R  W(L)  {x, y}. But each case gives a contradiction to Lemma 4.22, or the more specific instances of Lemma 4.21 and Corollary 4.19. Hence, we obtain that T is indeed a triangulation of C([m]v+, 2d + 1).
Putting Lemma 4.23, Lemma 4.24 and Remark 4.4 together finally yields Proposition 4.3. Now, using this result, we can apply the argument of Lemma 3.4 to the contraction [x  v  y].
Proof of Lemma 3.5. By Proposition 4.3, triangulations T of C([m]v+, ) such that T [x  v  y] = T are in bijection with sections W(L) of T \v. Moreover, given a section W(L) of T \v, the corresponding triangulation T has the set of -simplices
T   (W(L)  {x, y})  (L  x)  (U  y),
where T  denotes the -simplices of T which do not contain v and U is the complement of L in T \v.
The set-up of Lemma 3.5 gives us that T contains a cyclic subpolytope C(H, ). We let TH be the induced triangulation of this subpolytope in T . If v / H, then TH  T , so C(S, ) is a subpolytope of T . Hence, we assume that v  H. There are then three options:
(1) TH \v  L. (2) TH \v  U . (3) TH \v has non-empty intersection with both L and U. In case (1) we have that C((H \ v)  y, ) is a subpolytope of T . In case (2), we have that C((H \ v)  x, ) is a subpolytope of T . In case (3), let LH = L  TH and UH = U  TH . Then LH is a lower set of
v
the restriction of to TH \v. We then obtain a section W(LH ) of TH \v, and it is straightforward to see that W(LH ) consists of the (2d - 1)-simplices of W(L) which are also (2d - 1)-simplices of TH \v. By Proposition 4.3, we have that the section W(LH ) of TH \v gives us a triangulation TH of C(Hv+, ). Moreover, the triangulation TH of C(Hv+, ) has simplices
TH  (W(LH )  {x, y})  (UH  x)  (LH  y).
It is then clear that TH  T , W(LH )  W(L), UH  U , and LH  L. Hence TH is a subtriangulation of T , which gives us that C(Hv+, ) is a subpolytope of T .

4.6. Order-preservation. We finish the section by showing that the contraction [x  v  y] is order-preserving with respect to the second order. To do this, we show how this operation may be interpreted combinatorially, and then use this interpretation to show that it is order-preserving.

Lemma 4.25. Let T be a triangulation of C([m]v+, ) with v  [2, m - 1] and let T = T [x  v  y]. Then
°e(T ) = { A  Im /2 : A = A[x  v  y] for some A  °e(T ) }.
Note that this lemma applies to both  even and  odd. If  is odd and A  Im /2 is such that A = A[x  v  y] for some A  °e(T ), then we automatically have that A  Jm /2, since A  J[m/]2v+  .
Proof. It is immediate that
°e(T )  { A  Im /2 : A = A[x  v  y] for some A  °e(T ) }
from the definitions of °e(T ) and T [x  v  y]. We now show that
°e(T )  { A  Im /2 : A = A[x  v  y] for some A  °e(T ) }.
If A  °e(T ), then there must exist a simplex A of T such that A[x  v  y] = A. Without loss of generality, we may assume that {x, y}  A, since in this case we may remove either x or y from A and still have A[x  v  y] = A. But then we must have that A is an internal /2-simplex, since A is an internal /2-simplex. Hence, A  °e(T ), as desired.
We can now show that [x  v  y] is order-preserving with respect to the second order.
Proof of Lemma 3.6. We split into two cases depending on whether  is odd or even so that we can use the combinatorial interpretations of the second higher Stasheff­Tamari order.
We first let  = 2d. We show that if T 2 T , then T 2 T . Suppose that there exists B  °e(T ) and A  °e(T ) such that B  A. Then we have that B  °e(T ) and A  °e(T ), with A = A[x  v  y] and B = B[x  v  y], by Lemma 4.25. Then we also must have have B  A, since at most one of A and B can contain v. This implies that T 2 T , as desired.
We now let  = 2d + 1. We shall show that if T 2 T , then °e(T )  °e(T ). Let A  °e(T ). Then A = A[x  v  y] for some A  °e(T ) by Lemma 4.25. Since °e(T )  °e(T ), we then have that A  °e(T ), which implies that A[x  v  y] = A  °e(T ), as desired.
