## Abstract

One way to study an hypergraph is to attach to it a tensor. Tensors are a generalization of matrices, and they are an efficient way to encode information in a compact form. In this paper we study how properties of weighted hypergraphs are reflected on eigenvalues and eigenvectors of their associated tensors. We also show how to efficiently compute eingenvalues with some techniques from numerical algebraic geometry.
