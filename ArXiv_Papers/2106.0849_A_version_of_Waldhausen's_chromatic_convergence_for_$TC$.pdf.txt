A VERSION OF WALDHAUSEN'S CHROMATIC CONVERGENCE FOR T C
ANDREW J. BLUMBERG, MICHAEL A. MANDELL, AND ALLEN YUAN
Abstract. The map T C(S)p  holim T C(LnS)p is a weak equivalence.
1. Introduction
Motivated by the chromatic program in stable homotopy theory in general and chromatic convergence of the sphere spectrum in particular, Waldhausen [26] proposed studying the interaction of the chromatic tower with algebraic K-theory and made some specific conjectures about what happens for the p-local sphere spectrum. Waldhausen conjectured that K(S(p)) would be the homotopy limit of the algebraic K-theory spectra of LfnS, which would inductively be built from the algebraic K-theory of the monochromatic categories. The monochromatic categories are simpler than the p-local stable category and Waldhausen asked whether their algebraic K-theories would be correspondingly simpler to understand than the algebraic K-theory of the p-local sphere spectrum.
The advent of trace methods and the pioneering work of McClure and Staffeldt in calculating T HH of the Adams summand  reinvigorated this program. Ausoni and Rognes [2] calculated the periodic homotopy groups of K() in terms of T C(). As part of this work, Rognes made a series of far-reaching conjectures about the interaction of algebraic K-theory and chromatic localization. Most notably, he formulated a redshift conjecture about K-theory increasing chromatic complexity, and he formulated a higher chromatic Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjecture about Galois descent for algebraic K-theory spectra. Rognes' original formulations involved the localizations Ln (in place of Lfn), the p-complete sphere, and a p-complete version of Waldhausen's chromatic convergence conjecture, K(Sp )  holimn K(LnSp ).
When working with the p-complete sphere, there is very little difference between algebraic K-theory and T C: work of Hesselholt-Madsen [16, Thm. D] and Dundas [12] shows that the cyclotomic trace K(Sp )p  T C(Sp )p is a weak equivalence on connective covers. As a consequence, one is led to consider the T C analogues of Waldhausen's chromatic convergence conjectures. The purpose of this paper is to prove that analogue.

is a weak equivalence.
The ring spectra Ln(Sp ) are non-connective, and for non-connective ring spectra, we now have various potentially distinct versions of T C(-)p . Theorem 1.1 holds using either the original constructions T C(-)p and T C(-; p)p of Goodwillie [14] and B¨okstedt-Hsiang-Madsen [7] (which are equivalent for all ring spectra), or the constructions T C(-)p and T C(-; p)p of Nikolaus-Scholze [23, II.1.8].
McClure and Staffeldt [22] proved a version of Waldhausen's chromatic convergence conjecture for the connective covers 0LnS in place of LnS using a direct calculation involving the plus construction. Their argument adapts in outline to T C and we have a corresponding result in this case.
Theorem 1.2. The natural map
T C(Sp )p - holimn T C(0Ln(Sp ))p
is a weak equivalence.
One might hope to deduce the previous theorem directly from the McClureStaffeldt K-theory result using the Dundas-Goodwillie-McCarthy pullback square. However, our current state of knowledge of 0LnS makes this infeasible, and so we give a direct proof along the lines of the McClure-Staffeldt argument instead. The McClure-Staffeldt argument for Theorem 1.2 fundamentally relies on the Chromatic Convergence Theorem of Hopkins and Ravenel [25, 7.5.7] applied to S or Sp , propagating it through the construction of T C. Whereas in the K-theory case considered by McClure-Staffeldt, work of Bousfield-Kan [9, III§3] on pro-spaces suffices for the propagation, the T C case needs the more sophisticated theory of Isaksen [18] and Fausk-Isaksen [13] for pro-spectra and equivariant pro-spectra. (See Section 3.) The argument for Theorem 1.1 fits a similar outline but uses the weak equivalence T HH(LnS)  LnS to avoid pro-object arguments and requires chromatic convergence at a later step: it replaces the Hopkins-Ravenel Chromatic Convergence Theorem with Barthel's criterion for chromatic convergence [3, 3.8] applied to  + BCpk . (See Section 4.) Although not directly related to Waldhausen's conjecture or the Rognes program, Barthel's criterion also gives the following chromatic convergence result, which is superficially similar to Theorem 1.1 and also proved in Section 4.
Theorem 1.3. The natural map
T C(Sp )p - holimn(LnT C(Sp ))p
is a weak equivalence.
We have stated Theorems 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 in terms of Sp , but the corresponding results with Sp replaced everywhere by S or S(p) also hold; see Theorem 2.6. Indeed, the map T C(R)p  T C(Rp)p is a weak equivalence quite generally; we give precise statements in Propositions 2.2, 2.4, and 2.5. In the proofs, we concentrate on the case of S(p), which implies the other cases.
Conventions. In this paper, when a point-set category of spectra is necessary or implicit in a statement, we understand "spectrum" to mean orthogonal spectrum indexed on {Rn}; "ring spectrum" means associative ring orthogonal spectrum (or the equivalent) and "commutative ring spectrum" means commutative ring orthogonal spectrum (or the equivalent). We use T to denote the circle group (the unit length complex numbers) and Cm < T its cyclic subgroup of order m.

2. T C of a ring spectrum and its p-completion
In this section, we give a concise review of the construction of topological cyclic homology in order to introduce notation and details used in later sections. We discuss both the "classic" definition of a cyclotomic spectrum as introduced by Goodwillie [14] and B¨okstedt-Hsiang-Madsen [7] as well as the recent reformulation by Nikolaus-Scholze in terms of the Tate fixed point spectrum.
In the classic case, definitions of point-set categories of cyclotomic spectra and/or p-cyclotomic spectra can be found for example in [8, 1.1] (original source), [20, 2.4.4], [16, 2.2], [17, §1.1], to name a few. The notion of the homotopy theory and therefore -category of classic cyclotomic spectra and p-cyclotomic spectra are clear but implicit in these formulations; the paper [5] sets up a model* category of p-cyclotomic spectra for the purpose of making this explicit. The details involve the genuine T-equivariant stable homotopy theory localized at the Fp-equivalences, meaning that a map X  Y is a weak equivalence when it is a weak equivalence on (derived genuine categorical) Cpk -fixed points
X Cpk - Y Cpk
for all k  0. (Here "genuine" means stable with respect all finite dimensional orthogonal T-representations: for V any orthogonal T-action on Rn for some n, the endofunctor V is a categorical equivalence.) The (derived) Cp geometric fixed point functor Cp (or X  XCp ) goes from genuine Fp-local T-spectra to genuine Fp-local T/Cp-spectra and the pth root isomorphism p : T  T/Cp gives a categorical equivalence p from genuine Fp-local T/Cp-spectra to genuine Fplocal T-spectra. The structure map of a classic p-cyclotomic spectrum is a weak equivalence
r : pX Cp - X.
Construction 5.11 and Corollary 5.13 in [5] identify the mapping spectrum in pcyclotomic spectra Fcyc(X, Y ) (for p-cyclotomic spectra X, Y ) and the underlying mapping space is the space of homotopy commuting diagrams of structure maps; this in particular identifies the -category of p-cyclotomic spectra as the full subcategory of the lax equalizer (in the sense of [23, II.1.4]) from the Cp geometric fixed point to the identity functors of those objects for which the map is an isomorphism.
Barwick-Glasman [4] sets up an equivalent -category of p-cyclotomic spectra in a different -categorical framework using a spectral Mackey functor inspired model for equivariant stable homotopy theory. This theory contains features equivalent to those discussed in the previous paragraph (cf. the proof of Theorem 3.23 there); the remainder of this section and Section 4 adapt to the Barwick-Glasman [4] context without difficulty. We expect that the arguments in Section 3 also adapt either by choosing specific point-set models or by adapting the model theoretic arguments of Isaksen [18] and Fausk-Isaksen [13] used there.
A classic p-cyclotomic spectrum X comes with two maps XCpk  XCpk-1 :
F : the canonical inclusion of fixed points, and R: the composite
X Cpk = (pX Cp )Cpk-1 - (pX Cp )Cpk-1 - X Cpk-1

induced by the canonical map from the fixed points to geometric fixed points and the p-cyclotomic structure map.

Definition 2.1 (Classic T C). For a classic p-cyclotomic spectrum X and k > 0, let
T Ck(X ; p) = hoeq R, F : X Cpk  X Cpk-1 ,
the homotopy equalizer of R, F . Let
T C(X; p) = holimk T Ck(X; p).

Goodwillie [14, 12.1] first proposed an integral form of T C for cyclotomic spectra.

It is easier to take its fundamental property [14, 14.2] and turn it into a definition

as in Dundas-Goodwillie-McCarthy [11, VI.3.3.1]: define T C(X) as the homotopy

pullback

T C(X)

// XhT

 p T C(X; p)p

 // p(holimk X hCpk )p

where the map T C(X; p)  XhCpk is the composite

T C(X; p) - T Ck(X; p) - XCpk - XhCpk .

We note that the map XhT  holimk XhCpk becomes a weak equivalence after pcompletion (see, for example, [11, VI.2.1.1]); this immediately implies the following well-known result.

Proposition 2.2 (Goodwillie [14, 14.1.(ii)]). Let X be a classic cyclotomic spectrum. The map T C(X)p  T C(X; p)p is a weak equivalence.
Because of this proposition, we can use T C(X; p) exclusively in the classic context and deduce results for T C(X)p from the equivalence.
Nikolaus-Scholze [23, II.1.6] redefine cyclotomic spectra and p-cyclotomic spectra in terms of Borel equivariant spectra: for a topological group G, the homotopy theory or -category of Borel G-spectra is represented by the (relative) category of (left) G-objects in orthogonal spectra, where we take the weak equivalences to be maps that are weak equivalences of the underlying spectra. The underlying object of a cyclotomic spectrum is a Borel T-spectrum. The underlying object of a p-cyclotomic spectrum is a Borel Cp -spectrum, where Cp = colimk Cpk . The structure map for a p-cyclotomic spectrum X is a map of Borel Cp -spectra
 : X - p(XtCp )
where tCp denotes the Tate fixed point spectrum (the fixed points of the Tate spectrum of [15, p. 3]) and p is (as above) the pth root isomorphism T = T/Cp. A cyclotomic spectrum has such a structure map p for each p, which is required to be a map of Borel T-spectra, and we write  for the induced map into the product
 : X - p(XtCp).
p
Precisely, the Cp-Tate fixed points is a functor from Borel T-spectra to Borel T/Cpspectra or from Borel Cp -spectra to Borel Cp /Cp-spectra and the composite with p then gives an endofunctor of Borel T-spectra or Borel Cp-spectra. The

-category of p-cyclotomic spectra is the lax equalizer (in the sense of [23, II.1.4]) from the identity to the functor p(-)tCp and the -category of cyclotomic spectra is the lax equalizer from the identity to the product (over primes p) of the functors p(-)tCp [23, II.1.6].
For a Borel T-spectrum or Borel Cp -spectrum X, we have a canonical map of Borel T/Cp-spectra or Borel Cp /Cp-spectra from the Cp homotopy fixed points to the Cp-Tate fixed points
X hCp - X tCp
and a canonical isomorphism X hT = (p(X hCp ))hT or X hCp = (p(X hCp ))hCp .
We then obtain a canonical map
can : X hT - (p(X tCp ))hT or can : X hCp - (p(X tCp ))hCp .
p
In the case when X is a cyclotomic spectrum or p-cyclotomic spectrum, we have another map with the same domain and codomain obtained by taking the homotopy fixed points of 
hT : X hT - (p(X tCp ))hT or hCp : X hCp - (p(X tCp ))hCp .
p
Following [5], Nikolaus-Scholze [23, II.1.8] define T C(X) and T C(X; p) as mapping spectra but show in [23, II.1.9] that they may be computed as the homotopy equalizer of can and hT or can and hCp ; we use this theorem as a definition.
Definition 2.3 (Nikolaus-Scholze T C [23, II.1.9]). For a Nikolaus-Scholze cyclotomic spectrum X, define
T C(X) = hoeq can, hT : XhT  (p(XtCp))hT .
p
For a Nikolaus-Scholze p-cyclotomic spectrum X, define
T C(X ; p) = hoeq can, hCp : X hCp  (p(X tCp ))hCp .
We have a forgetful functor from cyclotomic spectra to p-cyclotomic spectra and projection onto the p factor induces a map T C(X)  T C(X; p). The following proposition is well-known and implicit in [23].
Proposition 2.4. Let X be a Nikolaus-Scholze cyclotomic spectrum. If X is either bounded below or p-local, then the map T C(X)p  T C(X; p)p is a weak equivalence.
Proof. Let  = p be prime. If X is p-local, then multiplication by  is an isomorphism on X; the canonical maps
(X)/C - (XhC) and (XhC) - ((X))C are then isomorphisms and XtC is trivial. If X is bounded below, then by [23, I.2.9], XtC is -complete, ( (XtC))hT is -complete, and the p-completion of ( (XtC))hT is trivial. Thus, if X is either p-local or bounded below, the map
T C(X) - hoeq can, hpT : XhT  (pXtCp)hT
is a p-equivalence. The maps
X hT - X hCp and (pX tCp )hT - (pX tCp )hCp

6

are also p-equivalences (for example, by [11, VI.2.1.1]) and it follows that the map T C(X)p  T C(X; p)p is a weak equivalence.
In particular, if all cyclotomic spectra under consideration are either connective or p-local, as is the case in the statement of Theorem 1.1, results on T C(-; p)p automatically imply the corresponding results on T C(-)p .
The Nikolaus-Scholze setting also has an analogue of T Ck(X; p): let
T Ck(X ; p) = hoeq can, hCpk-1 : X hCpk  (X tCp )hCpk-1 .
Since (-)hCp = holim(-)hCpk , we then have an equivalence
T C(X; p) = holimk T Ck(X; p).
Nikolaus-Scholze [23, II.4.10] (and its proof) show that when X is bounded below, we have a weak equivalence from classic T Ck(X; p) to Nikolaus-Scholze T Ck(X; p), which in the homotopy limit gives a weak equivalence from classic T C(X; p) to Nikolaus-Scholze T C(X; p).
Finally, for a ring spectrum R, we get a cyclotomic spectrum T HH(R), first constructed by B¨okstedt [6]. Now several equivalent constructions exist [1], [23, III]; see [10, §1] for a discussion and comparison. We caution that it is standard abuse of notation to write T C(R) and T C(R; p) for T C(T HH(R)) and T C(T HH(R); p), and this usually causes no confusion.
We need the fact from Patchkoria-Sagave [24, 3.8] that as a Borel T-spectrum T HH(R) is weakly equivalent to the (left derived) cyclic bar construction N cy(R), constructed out of (derived) smash powers of R. It is a fact inherited from the smash power that when R is connective, so is T HH(R) and also that the natural map
T HH(R)p - T HH(Rp)p
is a weak equivalence of Borel T-spectra, and a fortiori (see [5, 5.5]) a weak equivalence of both classic and Nikolaus-Scholze cyclotomic spectra.
It is well-known to experts (see, for example, [16, Add. 6.2] or [5, 6.10]) that the p-completion of T C(X; p) only depends on the p-completion of X. In the classic case, this is because p-completion commutes with fixed points. In the NikolausScholze case, this is because p-completion commutes with homotopy fixed points and the natural map
(X tCp )p - ((Xp)tCp )p
is a weak equivalence for any Borel Cp-spectrum. We summarize in the following proposition.
Proposition 2.5. In either the classic or Nikolaus-Scholze setting, for any pcyclotomic spectrum X, the natural map
T C(X; p)p - T C(Xp; p)p
is a weak equivalence and for any ring spectrum R, the natural map
T C(R; p)p - T C(Rp; p)p
is a weak equivalence.
For the purposes of our main results, we have proved the following theorem.

3. The Hopkins-Ravenel Chromatic Convergence Theorem and T C(S(p))
In this section, we apply the Hopkins-Ravenel Chromatic Convergence Theorem [25, 7.5.7] to prove Theorem 1.2. Specifically, Hopkins and Ravenel prove that the canonical map
S(p) - holimn LnS is a weak equivalence; indeed (it is well-known that) the argument shows that the map induces a pro-isomorphism on q for each q. The proof of Theorem 1.2 is to propagate the pro-isomorphism on homotopy groups through the T C construction. We prove the following theorem.
Theorem 3.1. The map of pro-spectra {T Ck(S(p); p)}  {T Ck(0LnS; p)} induces a pro-isomorphism on q pro-groups for all q  Z.
Taking the homotopy limit
T C(S(p); p) = holimk T Ck(S(p); p) - holimk holimn T Ck(0LnS; p)
- holimn holimk T Ck(0LnS; p) = holimn T C(0LnS; p),
we then get an S(p) version of Theorem 1.2, which by Theorem 2.6 is equivalent to Theorem 1.2. Because S(p) and 0LnS are all connective spectra, both flavors of T C are equivalent, and we only need to prove the theorem for classic T C; we discuss only this case.
The propagation argument uses results of Isaksen [18] and Fausk-Isaksen [13] on the homotopy theory of pro-spectra. We emphasize that this theory takes place in the point-set category of pro-objects in a point-set category of spectra, in our case, the category of orthogonal spectra indexed on {Rn}. In particular, Theorem 3.1 refers to a fixed (but unspecified) point-set tower of functors T Ck(-; p), point-set models 0LnS, and system of point-set maps S(p)  0LnS. As clearly such a setup exists and the details play no role in the arguments, we omit a discussion and precise specification. On the other hand, making certain specifications avoids some awkward circumlocutions in statements, so we consider only models that satisfy the following hypothesis.

Convention 3.2. The specific models used for the spectra S(p) and 0LnS in this section are cofibrant in one of the standard (stable) model structure on associative
ring orthogonal spectra or commutative ring orthogonal spectra.

We recall that a property of a spectrum or map of spectra is said to hold levelwise for a pro-spectrum or a level map of pro-spectra if the constituent spectra or maps of spectra have that property. More generally, the property is said to hold essentially levelwise on a pro-spectrum or (general) map of pro-spectra if the pro-spectrum or map is isomorphic in the pro-category to one where the property holds levelwise. In particular, a pro-spectrum is levelwise m-connected if its constituent spectra are m-connected and a level map of pro-spectra X  Y is a levelwise m-equivalence if each map in the system is an m-equivalence. A map of pro-spectra X  Y is an essentially levelwise m-equivalence if there exist pro-isomorphisms X = X and Y = Y  such that the composite X  Y  is represented by a level map that is a levelwise m-equivalence. The essentially levelwise m-equivalences plays a central role in the theory of [18, 13].

Definition 3.3. A map of pro-spectra is a weak equivalence (called -weak equivalence in [18] and H-weak equivalence in [13]) if it is an essentially levelwise mequivalence for all m  Z.

The main result on pro-spectra we need is the following adaptation of [18, 8.4] or [13, 9.13].

Theorem 3.4 (Isaksen [18, 8.4]). Let X = {Xs} and Y = {Yt} be levelwise (-N )connected pro-spectra for some N  Z. A map of pro-spectra X  Y is a weak equivalence in the sense of Definition 3.3 if and only if it induces on q a proisomorphism of pro-groups for all q > -N .

Although not stated explicitly, the proof of the theorem gives slightly more information: the pro-isomorphic spectra X = X and Y = Y  for which the composite map X  Y  is represented by a levelwise m-equivalence can be chosen so that
the constituent spectra are also (-N )-connected. We get the following immediate
corollary.

Corollary 3.5. For each m  0, there exists levelwise connective pro-spectra Xm = {Xtm} and Y m = {Ytm}, pro-isomorphisms Xm = {S(p)} and Y m = {0LnS}, and a levelwise m-equivalence Xm  Y m such that the diagram

Xm
=
 {S(p)}

// Y m
=
 // {0LnS}

commutes.

We now begin to apply this to get comparison results for the map {S(p)}  {0LnS}. In the following proposition, (-)(k) denotes k-fold smash power.
Proposition 3.6. The map of pro-spectra S(p)  {n  (0LnS)(k)} is a weak equivalence for each k  1.

Proof. Let Xm, Y m be as in Corollary 3.5. Writing (-)L(k) for the derived smash
power (in the stable category), for each t in the common indexing category for Xm, Y m, the map
(Xtm)L(k) - (Ytm)L(k)

CHROMATIC CONVERGENCE FOR T C

9

is an m-equivalence. These maps assemble into a level map of pro-objects in the stable category that fits into the following commutative diagram of maps of proobjects in the stable category.

(X m)L(k)

// (Y m)L(k)

 {S((kp))}

 // {(0LnS)(k)}

The vertical maps are pro-isomorphisms of pro-objects in the stable category and in particular induce pro-isomorphisms on homotopy groups. The top map is a levelwise isomorphism on q for q < m, and so the bottom map is a pro-isomorphism on q for q < m. Since m was arbitrary, the statement follows from Theorem 3.4.

In the following proposition, we use N cy to denote the cyclic bar construction for ring spectra.

Proposition 3.7. The map of pro-spectra {N cy(S(p))}  {N cy(0LnS)} is a weak equivalence.

Proof. The cyclic bar construction N cy(R) is the geometric realization of a simplicial spectrum with qth simplicial level the (q + 1)th smash power R(q+1). The hypotheses on S(p) and 0LnS (Convention 3.2) imply that the geometric realization is equivalent to the thickened realization obtained by gluing just using the face maps. The thickened realization Ncy(R) has a filtration by Hurewicz cofibrations
 = Ncy(R)-1 - Ncy(R)0 - Ncy(R)1 - Ncy(R)2 - · · · with Ncy(R) = colim Ncy(R)m and mth filtration quotient R(m+1)  [n]/. Because the spectra S((kp)) and (0LnS)(k) are connective for all k, the inclusion of the mth filtration piece Ncy(R)m  Ncy(R) is therefore an m-equivalence for these ring spectra. In particular, to prove the proposition, it suffices to prove that for each m, the map of pro-spectra
{Ncy(S(p))m} - {Ncy(0LnS)m}
induces a pro-isomorphism on each q pro-group. This certainly holds for m = -1 where both sides are trivial and holds by induction for all m by the previous proposition.

The cyclic bar construction N cy(R) comes with a natural action of the Lie group T. We can then form the homotopy orbit spectrum N cy(R)hCq = (N cy(R)  ECq+)/Cq. By naturality, we get maps of spectra N cy(S(p))hCq  N cy(0LnS)hCq
and a map of pro-spectra

(3.8)

{N cy(S(p))hCq } - {N cy(0LnS)hCq }.

Proposition 3.9. For each q  N, the map of pro-spectra (3.8) is a weak equivalence.

Proof. Theorem 3.4 works just as written in the Borel equivariant context where we understand weak equivalences (and m-equivalences) as maps that are weak equivalences (and m-equivalences, resp.) of the underlying spectra. In terms of [13], we look at the model structure on the category of orthogonal spectra with Cq-actions

10

ANDREW J. BLUMBERG, MICHAEL A. MANDELL, AND ALLEN YUAN

where the fibrations and weak equivalences are the equivariant maps that are fibrations and weak equivalences of the underlying spectra and use the Postnikov section t-structure. (This is the F -model structure of [21, IV.6.5] on orthogonal spectra indexed on {Rn} where F is the family containing only the trivial subgroup.) By the previous proposition and the Borel equivariant version of Theorem 3.4, for each m we can find pro-isomorphisms

X = N cy(S(p)),

N cy(0LnS) = Y

in the pro-category of orthogonal Cq-spectra so that the composite X  Y is represented by a level map that is a levelwise m-equivalence. We then have proisomorphisms

XhCq = N cy(S(p))hCq ,

N cy(0LnS)hCq = YhCq

and the composite map XhCq  YhCq remains a level map and a levelwise mequivalence.

For the next step, we need a model for T HH(S(p)) and the tower T HH(0LnS) with the correct genuine T-equivariant homotopy type to construct classic T C(-; p) and T Ck(-; p). It is convenient to assume the models to be fibrant in the category of p-cyclotomic spectra of [5]: this ensures that the point-set Cpk -fixed points have the correct homotopy type for all k. With this hypothesis, we get the following comparison result for the Cpk -fixed points applied to the map of pro-T-spectra {T HH(S(p))}  {T HH(0LnS)}.
Proposition 3.10. For each k, the map of pro-spectra
{T HH(S(p))Cpk } - {T HH(0LnS)Cpk }
is a weak equivalence.

Proof. For k = 0, the C1-fixed points are the underlying spectrum and the statement follows from the Proposition 3.7 using the Borel equivariant weak equivalence of T HH(R) and N cy(R) (for ring spectra R which are cofibrant or are cofibrant as commutative ring spectra).
Now let k  1. For a p-cyclotomic spectrum X, Theorem 2.2 of [16] constructs a "fundamental cofiber sequence" in the stable category
XhCpk - X Cpk - X Cpk-1 ,
natural in maps of p-cyclotomic spectra. Applying q we get a long exact sequence, and for the map of pro-spectra
{T HH(S(p))} - {T HH(0LnS)},
we get a homomorphism of long exact sequences in the pro-category of abelian groups. The map
{q(T HH(S(p))hCpk } - {q(T HH(0LnS)hCpk }
is a pro-isomorphism by Proposition 3.9 and the map {q(T H H (S(p))Cpk-1 } - {q(T H H (0LnS)Cpk-1 }
is a pro-isomorphism by induction, and we conclude that the map {q(T HH(S(p))Cpk } - {q(T HH(0LnS)Cpk }
is a pro-isomorphism by the five lemma.

Because T Ck(-; p) is defined as a homotopy equalizer of a pair of maps between the fixed points, we immediately deduce the following proposition.
Proposition 3.11. For each k, the map of pro-spectra {T Ck(S(p))}  {T Ck(0LnS)} is a weak equivalence.
Theorem 3.1 follows easily from the preceding proposition.

4. Barthel's chromatic convergence criterion and T C(S(p))
In this section, we prove Theorems 1.1 and 1.3 using Barthel's chromatic convergence criterion. This criterion abstracts the Hopkins-Ravenel proof of the Chromatic Convergence Theorem and states it in general terms for general p-local spectra as follows.
Theorem 4.1 (Barthel [3, 3.8]). Let X be a p-local spectrum whose BP -homology BPX has finite projective dimension as a graded BP-module. Then X  holim LnX is a weak equivalence.
We need only the following special cases.
Corollary 4.2. Let G = T or G = Cpk for some k  0; then the map ( + BG)(p)  holimn Ln( + BG) is a weak equivalence.
Proof. The Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence identifies BP(BT) as a free graded BP-module and it therefore has projective dimension 0. For G = Cpk , the case k = 0 is the Hopkins-Ravenel Chromatic Convergence Theorem. For k > 0, the Johnson-Wilson [19, (2.11)] argument generalizes from Cp to Cpk to show that BP(BCpk ) is projective dimension 1 as a graded BP-module.
The previous corollary immediately proves Theorem 1.3.
Proof of Theorem 1.3. The main result of [7] (in the case of the trivial group) identifies T C(Sp ; p)p  T C(S; p)p as
Sp  Fib(tr :  + BT - S)p
where tr denotes the transfer. Commuting wedges, suspension, and fiber sequences with homotopy limits, the result follows from Corollary 4.2.
The remainder of the section proves the following theorem.
Theorem 4.3. The map T C(S(p); p)  holim T C(LnS; p) is a weak equivalence.
The theorem is meant to apply to both classic T C and Nikolaus-Scholze T C, which for the non-connective spectra LnS are not equivalent. In both cases, by Theorem 2.6 the result for S(p) implies the result for S and Sp after p-completion and in particular implies Theorem 1.1.
For both classic T C and Nikolaus-Scholze T C, the argument starts with the observation that because Ln-localization is smashing, T HH(LnS) is Ln-local. It follows that the unit map S  T HH(LnS) factors through a weak equivalence LnS  T HH(LnS). Since the unit map is T-equivariant, we get a weak equivalence LnS  T HH(LnS) of Borel T-spectra for the trivial T-action on LnS. Taking homotopy orbits, we obtain the following proposition.
Proposition 4.4. The map S  T HH(LnS) induces a weak equivalence Ln( + BCpk ) - T HH(LnS)hCpk .

This proposition combined with Corollary 4.2 then implies the following proposition.
Proposition 4.5. The map T HH(S(p))hCpk  holimn T HH(LnS)hCpk is a weak equivalence.
Because homotopy fixed points commute with homotopy limits, the map T HH(S(p))hCp - holimn T HH(LnS)hCp
is also a weak equivalence. Applying this observation and the previous proposition in the case k = 1, we see that the map
T HH(S(p))tCp - holimn T HH(LnS)tCp
is a weak equivalence. Commuting homotopy fixed points with homotopy limits again, we see that the map
(T H H (S(p))tCp )h(Cp /Cp) - holimn(T H H (LnS)tCp )h(Cp /Cp)
is a weak equivalence. We can now prove Theorem 4.3.
Proof of Theorem 4.3 for Nikolaus-Scholze T C. Using the notation of Section 2, we have shown above that the maps
T HH(S(p))hCp - holimn T HH(LnS)hCp (p(T HH(S(p))tCp ))hCp - holimn(p(T HH(LnS)tCp ))hCp .
are weak equivalences. Since Nikolaus-Scholze T C(-; p) is the fiber of a map between these spectra, we get a weak equivalence
T C(S(p); p) - holimn T C(LnS; p).
Proof of Theorem 4.3 for classic T C. Recall that the "fundamental cofiber sequence" (Theorem 2.2 of [16])
XhCpk - X Cpk - X Cpk-1 inductively relates the fixed points and homotopy orbits of a p-cyclotomic spectrum. By Proposition 4.5 and induction, we see that the map
T HH(Sp)Cpk - holimn T HH(LnS)Cpk
is a weak equivalence for all k and we conclude that the map holimk T HH(Sp)Cpk - holimk,n T HH(LnS)Cpk
is a weak equivalence. Since T C(-; p) is the homotopy fiber of a self-map of holimk(-)Ck , we get a weak equivalence
T C(S(p); p) - holimn T C(LnS; p).
