Abstract. Intermittent maps of the interval are simple and widely-studied models for chaos with slow mixing rates, but have been notoriously resistant to numerical study. In this paper we present an effective framework to compute many ergodic properties of these systems, in particular invariant measures and mean return times. The framework combines three ingredients that each harness the smooth structure of these systems' induced maps: Abel functions to compute the action of the induced maps, Euler-Maclaurin summation to compute the pointwise action of their transfer operators, and Chebyshev Galerkin discretisations to compute the spectral data of the transfer operators. The combination of these techniques allows one to obtain exponential convergence of estimates for polynomially growing computational outlay, independent of the order of the map's neutral fixed point. This enables effective numerical exploration of intermittent dynamics in all parameter regimes, including in the infinite ergodic regime.

1. Introduction

Intermittent dynamics, wherein long periods of regular dynamics alternate with bursts of chaotic dynamics, is a feature of many physical systems around a bifurcation between chaotic and regular dynamics, such as in turbulence [16]. The ergodic and statistical behaviour of intermittent dynamics is commonly studied using a prototypical class of so-called Pomeau-Manneville-type maps, which we denote by P M . These maps are defined on the interval [0, 1], with phase spaces that can be divided into a "good" set [a, 1], on which the map is uniformly expanding, and a "bad" set close to an unstable but linearly neutral fixed point at 0:

(1)

f (x) = fb(x) := xh(x)), x  [0, a)

fg (x),

x  [a, 1],

where  > 0, fb  1, h(0) = 1, h (0) > 0 and fg : [a, 1]  [0, 1] is a full-branch expanding Markov map in class UNP , as defined in Appendix A. For simplicity we will assume fg satisfies an analytic distortion condition (B), also described in Appendix A, and h extends analytically into the complex plane, but our proofs
may be appropriately modified to cover the differentiable case.

This map and its typical dynamics for  = 0.8 are shown in Figure 1.

Maps of class P M are endowed with absolutely continuous invariant measures

(acims), which are finite for   (0, 1), and have summable correlations for

[10].

The standard framework for theoretical study of intermittent maps is via the

so-called induced map f  : [a, 1]  [a, 1] (i.e. f (x) iterated  (x) times). Here

 : [a, 1]  N+ is the return time to the inducing set, the "good" set [a, 1]:

(3)

 (x) := inf{n  N+ : f n(x)  [a, 1]}.

The induced map is uniformly expanding (see Figure 2), and it is therefore possible to apply results on uniformly expanding dynamics to it, as well as various numerical methods [18, 5, 4].

The non-mixing dynamics near the fixed point poses a problem for obtaining

accurate numerical estimates for these maps. This is true even when one naively

since for these values of  the acim has infinite measure [1].

Nonetheless, a variety of transfer-operator based numerical methods have been

considered. Various authors have proposed applying Ulam's method or modifica-

tions thereof to the full intermittent system: that is, partitioning the phase space

into intervals and calculating statistical properties from an associated discretisation

of the transfer operator [14, 8, 9]. With a suitable choice of partitions estimates of

the invariant measure were found to converge for  < 1 as O(N -(1-)), where N

is the cardinality of the partition: the source of this slow convergence is the map's

weak expansion near the neutral fixed point.

By discretising the transfer operator of the induced map, the slow convergence

with respect to the partition size was notionally avoided by [4] and the standard

convergence rate of Ulam's method, N -1 log N in the partition cardinality N , was

obtained. However, to calculate an Ulam-like discretisation of the transfer operator,

one must repeatedly evaluate the induced map: this requires iterating the full

map past the neutral fixed point, a procedure whose computational expense grows

as N . Furthermore, the number of evaluations of the induced map required to

estimate the transfer operator to a given accuracy is proportional to the norm of

the derivative of the induced map, which increases polynomially with the length of

the orbit of the full dynamics corresponding to the step of the induced map. The

computational time required to estimate an order N Ulam matrix is consequently

O(N +2) as opposed to the O(N ) for uniformly expanding maps, and perhaps

due to the inefficiency of this method, this numerical approach has not yet been

implemented. Consequently, it is clear that for good numerics it is not enough just

compute with the induced map: it is necessary also to avoid iterating through the

full dynamics.

In this paper, we will present a numerical method that both solves this prob-

lem and harnesses the smooth structure to attain fast convergence rates with low

numerical overhead. There are three main ingredients at play. The first ingredient

solves the problem of efficiently computing the induced map: this is achieved by

employing the Abel function, a concept developed in the area of functional itera-

tive equations [2, 11], with parallels in the theory of complex dynamics [7]. The

Abel function conjugates the map f close to the neutral fixed point to a unit shift,

thus allowing the induced map to be calculated in closed form. Furthermore, we

find that the Abel function possesses an asymptotic expansion that enables efficient

computation.

The second ingredient is the Chebyshev Galerkin transfer operator method [18,

5] (re-presented here in Appendix A), which enables statistical properties of the

induced map to be computed exponentially accurately. The Chebyshev method

requires pointwise evaluation of the action of the transfer operator of the induced

map, which has an infinite number of branches, each of which contribute to the

transfer operator.

To treat this efficiently, the final ingredient is the Euler-Maclaurin formula, which

allows us to very efficiently evaluate infinite sums over the branches. The end result

is that statistical properties of the induced map can practically be computed to very

4

COMPUTATION OF STATISTICS OF INTERMITTENT DYNAMICS

high accuracy: because many statistical properties of the full map can be obtained by summing appropriate statistics of the induced map over backward orbits (see Proposition 2.3 and Remark 2.1 below), the full map's statistical properties can then be accurately computed by the same methods.
These ingredients are extremely accurate and work more or less equally well for large  > 1 or near critical thresholds for statistics as for small . This is in great contrast to Birkhoff averaging or Ulam-style methods. To illustrate, we use the methods presented here to obtain highly accurate numerical estimates, which would be unattainable with previous techniques, and which moreover are rigorously validated. The methods we present therefore open up fine exploration of intermittent maps in the infinite ergodic case, as well as in limiting parameter regimes.
The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we state the main theorems that form the core ideas in our numerical methods, and in Section 3 we give some numerical results. In Section 4 we prove Theorems 2.1-2.2and in Section 5 we give explicit bounds on the convergence of Euler-Maclaurin summation over backward orbits.

2. Main theorems
We first state two theorems which allow us to efficiently compute the induced map by means of Abel functions, which allows us to express the induced map
f  (x) = (f  · · ·  f )(x)

 (x) times

in closed form. A cursory background on Abel functions is given in Section 4. In Theorem 2.1 we show that the induced map and return times can both be
expressed in terms of an Abel function, if it exists; in Theorem 2.2 we show that such a function exists and is the principal Abel function: we give an asymptotic expansion for it around the neutral fixed point.

Theorem 2.1. For maps in class P M , the return map f  : [a, 1]  [a, 1] has the explicit expression

(4)

f  = A-1({A(fg(x))})

where {y} denotes the fractional part of y. The return time  : [a, 1]  N given by (3) is also explicitly given in terms of
the Abel function by

where the bijection A : [0, 1]  [0, ] is an Abel function with

(6)

A(fb(x)) = A(x) - 1

for x  [0, a] and A(1) = 0.

Theorem 2.2. For maps in class P M there exists a (principal) Abel function A : [0, 1]  [0, ] such that

(a) A satisfies

Furthermore, this expansion, truncated after the zN term for N  1, has error

Because the induced map has many desirable properties for the computation

of statistical properties, in particular being uniformly expanding, we will compute

statistical properties of the full map using those of the induced map. This will

at various points require the computation of sums over backward orbits of the

intermittent dynamics: for example, using the chain rule the transfer operator of

the induced map has the form

(9)

Lind(z) =

|(f  ) (y)|-1(y) =

(fbn) (fg(y))-1|fg(y)|-1(y).

f  (y)=z

nN,fbn(fg (y))=z

To deal with these sums in a unified way, we will suppose that the summands of these systems can be written as functions Q of the backward orbit x = fg(y), the derivative d = (fbn(x))-1, and the orbit index x: for example, from (9) we can see that the induced map's transfer operator has summand function QLind,(x, d, n)

QLind,(x, d, n) = d(Lg)(x),

where Lg is the transfer operator of fg : [a, 1]  [0, 1]:

(Lg)(x) =

|fg (y)|-1 (y).

fg (y)=x

6

COMPUTATION OF STATISTICS OF INTERMITTENT DYNAMICS

We introduce the operator T[n; ·] which acts on the summand functions Q : (0, 1] × R × N  R so as to output the nth summand:

(10)

T[Q](n; x) = Q(fb-n(x), (fb-n) (x), n)

(11)

= Q(A-1(A(x) + n), (A (x)(A-1) (A(x) + n), n).

We further introduce the operator S which acts on the summand functions Q to output the sum over all n:



(12)

S[Q](x) = T[Q](n; x)..

n=0

In Section 5 we will show that, when Q extends to a complex analytic function,

these sums S[Q](x) may be very efficiently estimated using the Euler-Maclaurin

formula.

The proposition provides the recipe to compute the transfer operator Lind and

the acim of the induced map, via Abel functions. We consider the so-called solution

operator for the induced map: Sind = (id -Lind + u  )-1, where  is the Lebesgue

integral

functional

on

[a, 1]

and

u(x)

=

1 1-a

.

Proposition 2.3. Let f  P M as in (1). The induced map's invariant probability
measure ind is given by Sindu. Furthermore, the induced map's transfer operator Lind : BV ([a, 1])  BV ([a, 1])
can be written as Lind[](x) = S[QLind,](x), where QLind,(x, d, n) = d(Lg)(x).

Remark 2.1. Many statistics of the full dynamics may be efficiently computed

through similar formulations. In particular, we have the following formulae for

some statistical quantities associated the full dynamics:

(1) Expectations of functions  of the return time to the inducing set are given by

where

Q,(x, d, n) = (n)d(Lg)(x).

(2) The full invariant measure dx evaluated pointwise is given by

This is normalised so its restriction to [a, 1] is a probability measure; for

 < 1 it may be renormalised to a probability measure on the full set by the

Theorems 2.1-2.2 and Proposition 2.3 can be exploited to design algorithms to capture statistical properties of intermittent maps with high accuracy. We give some results from such an algorithm in Section 3.

3. Numerical results

We have implemented rigorously validated algorithms suggested by the work in this paper to compute acims and return times.
The first goal is to be able to evaluate the Abel function. One first estimates the coefficients of the Abel function's asymptotic expansion (8) by matching Taylor coefficients at x = 0 of the Abel equation (6), with rigorous bounds on the error of this expansion given in Theorem 2.2. This immediately enables accurate evaluation of the Abel function for x near the fixed point: away from the fixed point accurate estimates may be calculated by numerically iterating backwards until for some k  N an iterate fb-k(x) sufficiently close to 0 is reached, and then by using that A(fb-k(x)) = A(x) + k.
To compute statistical quantities, the algorithm computes a Chebyshev Galerkin matrix as in [18, 5]: the action of the transfer operator on Chebyshev basis functions is evaluated pointwise by using Proposition 2.3 and (27). By the Chebyshev method the acim of the induced map can be rigorously estimated as in Algorithm 1 in [18]. Estimates of the return time are obtained by a rigorous computation of the return time formula in Remark 2.1(a) using the Euler-Maclaurin formula (27); pointwise estimates of the full map's acim are obtained similarly using Remark 2.1(b).
We applied these methods to LSV maps (2) for various values . Plots of the acims obtained using our method are given in Figure 4 with comparisons to estimates obtained using long time series. An example of the rigorous estimate is given in the following theorem:

Theorem 3.1. For the LSV map with parameter  = 0.95, the expected return

610 756 609 803 3171 ± 10-43.

It is illustrative of the power of the method, particularly of the Abel function

numerics, to contrast this with an estimate of the expected return time obtained

via iterating the LSV map: the sample of 108 iterates used in Figure 4 furnished

an estimate ind(( ))  8.63, a 40% error. This large error arises because the

The results for different values of  were each obtained in 6 hours over 15 hyper-

threaded cores of a research server running 2 E5-2667v3 CPUs with 128GB of

memory. The number of basis elements used in the Chebyshev Galerkin method

was N = 512, and 256-bit extended floating point arithmetic was used using the

ValidatedNumerics library in Julia [6].

Let us briefly note that at a preliminary stage in the development of these numerical methods, we implemented adaptive algorithms to compute acims of the

induced and full systems using floating-point arithmetic. These algorithms were similar in spirit to, and made use of, the Poltergeist package discussed in [18]. In place of the Euler-Maclaurin formula algorithms we propose, a poorly optimised version of the already less numerically efficient Abel-Plana formula [15], the adaptive method could obtain acim estimates accurate to 13 decimal places in around 20 seconds. With good numerical optimisation and using the Euler-Maclaurin formula we believe that it would be possible to obtain these estimates in around 2 seconds, and intend on implementing these methods in future.
4. Return maps and Abel function
Given an iterated function of one dimension xn+1 = g(xn), a function A is considered an Abel function of g if it satisfies the Abel functional equation A(g(x)) = A(x) + 1 and is invertible (at least locally). The existence and behaviour of Abel functions around fixed points which are linearly neutral and stable (as opposed to unstable, the case we consider) have been studied in statistics [17, 11]. This corresponds to studying the local inverse fb-1 of our map near the fixed point 0, because the fixed point is linearly neutral and unstable. Consequently, our definition assumes iteration of f decrements the Abel function A (as in Theorem 2.1) rather than incrementing it, as is standard in the literature.
Around a fixed point there are an infinite number of continuous or even smooth solutions to the Abel functional equation. It is possible to define a so-called principal Abel function via a certain iterative equation [17], which may be seen to be

COMPUTATION OF STATISTICS OF INTERMITTENT DYNAMICS

equivalent to (7): principal Abel functions have the best regularity properties of all possible solutions to the Abel equation.
We begin by proving Theorem 2.1, which states that the induced map and return time can be appropriately computed using a monotonic function A satisfying the Abel equation (6).

Proof of Theorem 2.1. Suppose A is a bijection [0, 1]  [0, ] satisfying A(fb(x)) = A(x) - 1 and A(1) = 0. For x  (a, 1], the return time, which measures the number of iterates required to return to the inducing set, is given by
 (x) = inf{n  N+ : f n(x)  [a, 1]}.
This definition implies that f j(x)  (0, a) for 0 < j <  (x), and consequently f j(x) = fb(f j-1(x)) = A-1(A(f j-1(x) - 1)) for 0 < j <  (x). As a result,
f  (x) = f (x)(x) = fb(x)-1(f (x)) = A-1(A(f (x)) -  (x) + 1),
and since x  (a, 1], f (x) = fg(x). Since f  (x)  (a, 1] and since A : [0, 1]  [0, ] is a bijection with A(1) = 0, we
find that A is decreasing and so 0  A(f  (x)) < A(a) = A(fb(a))+1 = A(1)+1 = 1, and consequently A(f (x))- (x)+1  [0, 1). Using that  (x) is an integer we obtain (4) and (5).

We will now prove the existence of a principal Abel function with nice asymptotic properties (Theorem 2.2). We will do this by showing that an analytic function satisfying part (b) of the theorem must have asymptotic properties as given in part (a). Using results in [17], we then prove the existence of such a function.

Proof of Theorem 2.2. In this setting we find it convenient to transform to coordinates z = x, considering the conjugated inverse map which we define

T^(z) := zh^(z) := fb-1(x).

By the implicit function theorem, T^ is uniquely defined for z in a complex neigh-

bourhood of [0, a], and in particular for |z|  R for some R > 0. We consider

the principal Abel function for this map, having A^(T^(z)) = A^(z) + 1, and set

A(x) = A^(z).

Let the power series at 0 of T^(z) = z +

 n=1

h^ n

(-z

)n+1:

in

particular,

h^ 1

=

h (0). We have that T^-1 is analytic in a neighbourhood of zero with T^-1(z) 

z + h^1z2 + . . ., and consequently that T^ is similarly analytic near zero with T^(z) 

z - h^1z2 + . . ..

For n  0 define the following functions, which are holomorphic except at zero,

with constant C to be determined later, such that as z  0,

A^n(T^(z)) - A^n(z) + 1 =: Dn(z) = O(zn+2).

Let us define the function g by

From the Taylor expansion of T^ at z = 0 we can see that the magnitude |g(z)|  G for all |z|  R and some constant G < .
The error Dn is given by the following lemma, whose proof is in Appendix B:

The following lemmas, whose proofs are in Appendix B give bounds on iterates of T^:

Define the sets

Sr = {z  C | 0 < |z| < r, z-1  R1}

for r > 0, where R1 is given in Lemma 4.2, and consider a function A^ : Sr  C such that for all z  Sr and n > 0,

Later, we will show that A(z) where A is given in (7) is such a function. We will

prove bounds on |T^n(z)| for z  SR for some R < R, which will allow us to bound the error between A^ and the A^n on this set.
Now defining En(z) = A^(z) - A^n(z),

we have that

En(z) = En(T^(z)) - (A^(T^(z)) - A^(z)) + (A^n(T^(z)) - A^n(z)) = En(z) + Dn(z)

and thus by (23) and the fact that f -k(z)  0 as k  , we have that


En(z) = Dn(T^k(z))

When z-1  R1 we can apply Lemma 4.3 to obtain that for n  1 and |z|  min{R1, rn},

where

(25)

d3 = n+2,0d2

Consequently A^ satisfies the appropriate asymptotic expansion generated by the A^n with the error bound given by (24).
By change of coordinates x = z we have that

En(z) = d3(d2/rn)n+2 |z|- - dR -(n+1) .

We now show that A^ is in fact given by the principal Abel function that we

desired. Let

Note that A^(x) is just our principal Abel function (7), and A^(T^(z)) = A^(z) - 1 where A^ is defined. As a result of Lemma 7 in [17], A^ extends into the complex

for | z-1| > D, | z-1|  C. By Lemma 4.2 we have that T^n(z)-1 is increasing in n, and the following lemma, proved in Appendix B, gives that T^n(z)-1 is

bounded:

Lemma 4.4. For all z with z-1  R1,
sup T^k(z)-1 < .
kN
As a result, T^n(z) goes to 0 as n  . Furthermore, as a result of the monotonicity of fb and (7), A is clearly monotonically increasing on [0, 1]  [0, ]; because it is analytic and unbounded it must be a bijection.

Remark 4.1. The Thaler map is an interval map with an explicitly known invariant measure that has a neutral fixed point of order 1 +  at zero:
f (z) = z 1 + z-1 (1 + z)1- - 1 1/(-1) .
This map is not in class P M as the series expansion of f (z)/z at zero contains integer powers of z as well as of z. However, one could extend the methods in this paper accordingly.

5. Calculating statistical properties via inducing

Because the infinite sums required to evaluate statistical properties, such as in Proposition 2.3 and Remark 2.1, are summing over smooth functions evaluated on a lattice, we can use the Euler-Maclaurin formula to approximate these sums with exponentially decreasing errors. We state a general theorem that in particular allows us to obtain rigorous bounds on the error of these approximations.
Define the small, bounded sets Rs := {x  C : (x-)  s-1}, and its transform to z coordinates, R^s := {z  C : (z-1)  s-1}.
We will first find it useful to define a constant encoding the regularity of our of our map,

d

= sup

and a radius

(26)

Z := min{R1, (2G )-1/2, (2G 2,0)-1},

which will be used to specify the region inside which the Euler-Maclaurin formula may be used.
Theorem 5.1. Suppose Q(x, d, n) is analytic such that for some Q¯, some nonnegative , ,  with ¯ := ( + (1 + ))/ > 1 + , and for all z  RR, all d  1 and all n with n > 0,

From Lemma 4.2 we have that if s-1 = z- with s-1 > Z-1 +2h^1, then z  Rs with

for integer n, and from Proposition 5.2 that for n  (0, 1) that

(29)

A-1(A(z) + n)  R(s-1+h^1((1-)n-2))-1 .

Thus, for any z, n  n, and m  B(0,  + (1 - )(n - n)/2),  := A-1(A(z) + n + m)  RZ and so

The following lemma, used in the proof of Theorem 5.1 bounds the derivative of the Abel function:

Lemma 5.3. For any z  RZ , (2h1)-1  |z+1A (z)|  2h-1 1.

Appendix A. Numerical calculation of statistical properties of
induced map
We summarise here briefly the Chebyshev Galerkin spectral method proposed in [18], which we use to numerically approximate the action of the induced map's socalled solution operator. This method discretises the transfer operator in Chebyshev
We define maps in UNP as those self-maps f of an interval [p, q] that satisfy:
(1) There are open disjoint intervals O,   I whose union is of full measure in [p, q] such that the inverse of f |O extends to a bijection v : [p, q]  O. (Full-branch condition)
(2) The map has bounded distortion:

(D1)

sup

v (x) v(x)

(3) It is C-uniformly expanding, that is, that

(CE)

(q - x)(x - p) |f (x)| > 1.

xI O (q - f (x))(f (x) - p)

(4) The interval O satisfy the partition spacing condition:

(P)

Furthermore, we will assume the following analytic distortion bound holds:

Remark A.1. If fg  UNP considered as a map [a, 1]  [0, 1], and if f  P M , then f   UNP . Furthermore, if fg also satisfies (B) in the same sense, then f  satisfies (B).

which are orthogonal on [p, q] with respect to the weight 1/ (q - x)(x - p). Let PN be the operator projecting a function onto the first N + 1 Chebyshev polynomials.

Theorem A.1 (Wormell, 2019 [18]). Let the operator

KN = PN (I - LN + 1  )|PN (BV ), where  denotes the Lebesgue total integral functional, and let SN = KN-1.
Then for all maps in UNP satisfying B, there exist constants p, K (see Remark 5.4 and the proof of Theorem 2.3 in [18]) such that for all functions   PN (BV ),
SN  - S BV  Ke-(-p)N .
Furthermore, S1 is the acim of f .

Appendix B. Proof of Lemmas 4.1-4.4

Proof of Lemma 4.1. Matching power series coefficients at z = 0, we have that

for some c  (0, 1) and let

Mn,r = sup |Dn(z)| .
|z|r

We have as a result of (34) that for any r  rn

|an|



1 nh^ 1

r-n-1Mn-1,r

Consequently, for n  1 and r  rn we have that

Mn,r  Mn-1,r + |an| sup |T^(z)n - zn|

We now aim to bound
M0,r = sup a-1((T^(z))-1 - z-1) + a log(z-1T^(z)) .
|z|r
From (33) it can be shown that a = h^-1 2g(0), and thus |a |  h^-1 1G. Furthermore, (36) gives that
|z-1T^(z)|  1 - n-1c  1 - c,
giving that
M0,r0  h^-1 1(h^1 + Gr0) + h^-1 2G log((1 - c)-1)  1 + h^-1 2G(c - log(1 - c)) := d1d22
where in the last line we used (35). Thus, since Dn(z) = O(zn+2) as z  0, for all |z| smaller than r, where r is as
in (35),
|Dn(z)|  (|z|/rn)n+2 sup |Dn(w)|  d1d22 dn2 |z|n+2rn-(n+2).
|w|=rn
Choosing c = 0.4 we finally obtain the required bounds.

Proof of Lemma 4.2. We proceed by induction on (21) and (22). The base case clearly holds as T^0(z) = z. Suppose that (21) and (22)hold for some k  N. Then |T^k(z)|  (RT^k(z)-1)-1  R1, where R1 := min{R, G-1h^1}. Because R1  R we
can apply (17), giving

(38)

|T^k+1(z)-1 - T^k(z)-1 - h^1|  G|T^k(z)|  G-1h^1.

Since

T^k+1(z)-1 - T^k(z)-1 - h^1  T^k+1(z)-1 - T^k(z)-1 - h^1 ,

we obtain from (38) that (21) must also hold for k + 1. Furthermore, since |T^k+1(z)-1 - T^k(z)-1 - h^1| = (T^k+1(z)-1 - (k + 1)h^1) - (T^k(z)-1 - kh^1),
the inequality (38) implies (22) for k + 1.

Proof of Lemma 4.3. From Lemma 4.2 we have





|T^k(z)|¯k  (|z-1 + h^1k|-1 - h^1k)-¯k

max{z-1, h^1k} - h^1k -¯ k.

The summand is increasing for k  h^-1 1z-1 and decreasing for larger k. Thus we can use an integral bound:

18

which using that 2F1(¯,  + 1,  + 2, )  (1 - )-¯ and |z|  R1-1 gives the desired bound.

Proof of Lemma 4.4. We know that g(z) is analytic for complex |z|  R; as a result, if we define g1 := g (0) and g2(z) = z-1(g(z) - g1) we have that g2 is bounded for |z|  R by some constant G2 < . Since g maps real inputs to real inputs, we also know that g1 is real. Combining this with (17), we have for |z|  R1  R that
T^(z)-1 - z-1 = h^1 + g1z + g2(z)z2,
and so taking imaginary parts,
T^(z)-1 - z-1 = g1 z + (g2(z)z2) = -g1|z|2 z-1 + (g2(z)z2).
We can then bound the growth in the imaginary part of z-1 under iteration by T^:
| T^(z)-1|  (1 + g1|z|2)| z-1| + G2|z|2.
Since for z  R1 we have from Lemma 4.2 that |T^k(z)|  R for all k  N, we obtain the linear recurrence relation
| T^k+1(z)-1|  (1 + g1|z|2)|T^k(z)-1| + G2|z|2.
Since by Lemma 4.2, |z|2 = O(k-2) for all z  R1, iterates of this equation are bounded, as required.
