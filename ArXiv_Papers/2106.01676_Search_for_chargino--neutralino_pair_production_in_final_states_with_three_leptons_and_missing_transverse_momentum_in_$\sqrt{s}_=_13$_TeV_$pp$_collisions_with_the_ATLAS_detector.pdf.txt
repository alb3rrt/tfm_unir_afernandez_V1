Search for chargino­neutralino pair production in final states with threeleptons and missing
transverse momentum in  = 13 TeV   collisions with the ATLAS detector

The ATLAS Collaboration

A search for chargino­neutralino pair production in three-lepton final states with missing transverse momentum is presented. The study is based on a dataset of  = 13 TeV  

collisions recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb-1. No significant excess relative to the Standard Model predictions

is found in data. The results are interpreted in simplified models of supersymmetry, and

statistically combined with results from a previous ATLAS search for compressed spectra in

1 Introduction
Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1­6] postulates a symmetry between bosons and fermions, and predicts the existence of new partners for each Standard Model (SM) particle. This extension offers a solution to the hierarchy problem [7­11] and provides a candidate for dark matter as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), which will be stable in the case of conserved -parity [12].
This paper describes a search for direct production of charginos and neutralinos, mixtures of the SUSY partners of the electroweak gauge and Higgs () bosons, decaying to three charged leptons, and significant missing transverse momentum (pmT iss, of magnitude Tmiss). The search uses the full Run 2 dataset of proton­proton collisions recorded between 2015 and 2018 with the ATLASdetector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Protons were collided at a centre-of-mass energy  of 13 TeV and the dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb-1 [13]. Similar searches at the LHC have been reported by the ATLAS [14­20] and CMS collaborations [21­27].
Previous results are extended by analysing the full ATLAS Run 2 dataset, improving the signal selection strategies ­ particularly for intermediately compressed mass spectra, and exploiting improved particle reconstruction performance. Significant gains in lepton identification and isolation performance follow from updates in the electron reconstruction as well as from the use of a novel multivariate discriminant [28]. Furthermore, the new results are statistically combined with a previous ATLAS search [18] targeting compressed mass spectra and two-lepton final states. Finally, the paper reports updated results for a previous ATLAS search which observed excesses of three-lepton events in the partial, 36 fb-1, Run 2 dataset [15]. The original analysis using the Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction (RJR) technique [29, 30] is repeated using the full Run 2 dataset, and no significant excesses relative to the SM expectation are observed. A related follow-up search emulating the RJR technique with conventional laboratory-frame variables, also using the full Run 2 dataset, was published in Ref. [16]. The updated RJR results are not included in the combination with the new results, as they are not statistically independent and not competitive with the results of the new search optimised for the full Run 2 dataset.
Section 2 introduces the target SUSY scenarios, while a brief overview of the ATLAS detector is presented in Section 3, followed by a description of the dataset and Monte Carlo simulation in Section 4. After a discussion of the event reconstruction and physics objects used in the analysis in Section 5, Section 6 covers the general analysis strategy, including the definition of signal regions, background estimation techniques, and systematic uncertainties. This is followed by Section 7, with details specific to the on-shell  selection and the  selection, and Section 8, with details specific to the off-shell  selection. Results are presented in Section 9, together with the interpretation in the context of relevant SUSY scenarios. Section 10 reports the follow-up RJR analysis, and finally Section 11 summarises the main conclusions.

Such a hierarchy is typically predicted by either a class of models in the framework of gaugino mass

unification at the GUT scale (including mSUGRA [35, 36] and cMSSM [37]), or a MSSM parameter

space where the discrepancy between the measured muon anomalous magnetic moment [38], and its SM

predictions

[39]

can

be

explained

[40­42].

When

the

mass-splitting

between

±

1

and

0
1

is

15­30

GeV,

this

hierarchy is also motivated by the fact that the LSP can naturally be a thermal-relic dark-matter candidate

that was depleted in the early universe through co-annihilation processes to match the observed dark-matter

density [43­45]. These models are poorly constrained by dark-matter direct-detection experiments, and collider searches constitute the only direct probe for || > 800 GeV [46].

second

scenario,

referred

as

the

`higgsino

3 ATLAS detector
The ATLAS detector [68] is a general-purpose particle detector with almost 4 solid angle coverage around the interaction point.2 It consists of an inner tracking system surrounded by a superconducting solenoid, sampling electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer encompassing superconducting toroidal magnets. The inner detector (ID) reconstructs charged-particle tracks in the pseudorapidity range || < 2.5, using silicon pixel and microstrip subsystems followed by a transition radiation tracker. For  = 13 TeV data-taking an additional innermost layer, the insertable B-layer [69, 70], was added to the pixel tracker to

2 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector

and the -axis along the beam pipe. The -axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the -axis points upwards.

Cylindrical coordinates (, ) are used in the transverse plane,  being the azimuthal angle around the -axis. Pseudorapidity is 
defined in terms of the polar angle  as  = - ln tan(/2). Angular distance is measured in units of   ()2 + ()2.

improve tracking performance and flavour identification of quark-initiated jets. The ID is immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field provided by the surrounding thin, superconducting solenoid.
Beyond the ID a high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic sampling calorimeter (ECAL) and a steel/scintillator-tile hadronic sampling calorimeter cover || < 3.2 and || < 1.7 respectively. In the forward regions a copper/LAr endcap calorimeter extends the hadronic coverage to 1.7 < || < 3.2, while copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr forward calorimeters are used for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements in the 3.1 < || < 4.9 region. The muon spectrometer (MS) surrounds the calorimeters and comprises three layers of trigger and high-precision tracking chambers spanning || < 2.4 and || < 2.7, respectively. A magnetic field is provided by a system of three superconducting air-core toroidal magnets with eight coils each.
Events of interest are selected using a two-level trigger system [71] consisting of a custom hardware-based first-level (L1) trigger followed by a software-based high-level trigger (HLT). The L1 trigger accepts events from the 40 MHz bunch crossings at a rate below 100 kHz, which the high-level trigger reduces in order to record events to disk at about 1 kHz.

4 Data and Monte Carlo simulated event samples

 This analysis exploits the full Run 2  = 13 TeV   dataset recorded by the ATLAS experiment during

stable beam conditions between 2015 and 2018. The LHC collided protons with bunch-crossing intervals of 25 ns, and the average number of interactions per crossing in data was  = 34. After applying beam,

detector and data-quality requirements [72], the dataset corresponds to a total integrated luminosity of 139 fb-1 [13], with an uncertainty in the integrated luminosity of 1.7%, obtained using the LUCID-2

detector [73] for the primary luminosity measurements.

The

are

using

Carlo

(MC) simulation. The MC samples are used in the optimisation of event selection criteria, as well as for

yield prediction and the estimation of systematic uncertainties in the yield prediction. The yield prediction

for the dominant  background is improved by extracting normalisation factors from data in dedicated

control regions, as discussed in Section 6.2. The background contribution from events with one or more

misidentified or non-prompt leptons is estimated using a data-driven method also outlined in Section 6.2.

For all other processes, the MC-predicted yields are used directly. The samples are produced including

an ATLAS detector simulation [74] based on G 4 [75], or a faster simulation using a parameterised

calorimeter response [76] and G 4 for all other detector systems. Simulated events are reconstructed in

the same way as data events. Details of the MC simulation, including the generators used for the matrix

element (ME) calculation and the parton shower (PS), hadronisation and underlying event (UE) modelling,

the parton distribution function (PDF) sets used in the ME and PS, the set of tuned parameter values used

as the UE tune, and the order of the cross-section calculations used for yield normalisation are given in

Table 1 and briefly discussed below.

employing the five-flavour scheme (four-flavour in case of single-top t-channel), and a diagram removal

scheme [137] was used in the case of t to remove interference and overlap with ¯ production. Other top-quark processes (¯, t, t, ¯, ¯ (  Wb + (/  )), 3-top and 4-top) were modelled

using M G 5_aMC@NLO 2 + P 8. Samples of Higgs boson production via gluon fusion,

vector-boson fusion and associated production were generated using P

B 2 + P 8.

All background and signal samples make use of E G 1.6.0 and 1.2.0 [138] for the modelling of - and -hadrons, except those generated using S . The effect of additional interactions in the same and neighbouring bunch crossings (pile-up) was included by overlaying simulated minimum-bias interactions onto each hard-scatter process. The simulation was done using P 8.2 with the A3 tune [139] and the NNPDF2.3lo set of PDFs, and the samples were reweighted such that the pile-up distribution matches the one in data.

5 Event reconstruction and preselection

The strategy for event reconstruction and preselection is defined here, where a common approach has been adopted for all regions in the analysis, unless specified otherwise. Further selection specific to individual regions is discussed in Sections 6 to 8.

Events are chosen for the  and on-shell  selections using dilepton triggers and for the off-shell 

selection using single-lepton, dilepton and trilepton triggers [140, 141]. The off-shell  selection is

complemented

The primary objects used in this analysis are electrons, muons and jets. To be considered, reconstructed objects must satisfy `baseline' loose identification criteria; to be selected for the analysis regions, they must also survive a second, tighter set of `signal' identification requirements. Additionally, a lepton `anti-ID' requirement is defined, corresponding to leptons that satisfy the baseline criteria but not the signal criteria. These anti-ID leptons are used in the +jets background estimation in Section 6.2. Hadronically decaying -leptons are not considered in the analysis, and the term `lepton' always refers to electrons or muons in this document.

Electron candidates are reconstructed from three-dimensional clustered energy deposits in the electromag-

netic calorimeter (ECAL), matched to an ID track [145]. Muon candidates are reconstructed by matching

MS tracks or track segments to ID tracks [146]. Electron and muon candidates are calibrated in situ [145,

146], using   , /  ,    and /   decays. Baseline electrons are required to have


T

>

4.5

GeV

and

fall

within

the

acceptance

of

the

ID

(||

<

2.47).

They

are

further

required

to

satisfy

the

calorimeter- and tracking-based `Loose and B-layer likelihood' identification [145]. Baseline muons must

have


T

>

3

GeV

and

||

<

2.5,

and

satisfy

Medium

identification

criteria

[146].

To

suppress

pile-up,

both

the baseline electrons and baseline muons are required to have a trajectory consistent with the primary

vertex,

i.e.

|
0

sin

|

<

0.5

mm.6

Jet candidates are reconstructed from topological energy clusters in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters [147], grouped using the anti- algorithm [148, 149] with radius parameter  = 0.4. After

subtracting the expected energy contribution from pile-up following the jet area technique [150], the

jet energy scale (JES) and resolution (JER) are corrected to particle level using MC simulation, and

then calibrated in situ using +jets, +jets and multet events [151, 152]. Baseline jets must then have


T

>

20

GeV,

and

fall

within

the

full

calorimeter

acceptance

(||

<

4.5).

Photon candidates are reconstructed from energy clusters in the ECAL provided they have no matched

track, or have one or more matched tracks consistent with photon conversion origin. Baseline photons,

while not used in the signal regions, are included in the calculation of missing transverse momentum, and

used

in

SM

background

estimation

validation.

They are

required

to

have


T

>

25

GeV,

fall inside

the

ECAL strip detector acceptance (|| < 2.37), but outside the ECAL transition region (||  [1.37, 1.52]).

Candidates must also satisfy Tight identification criteria [145].

Ambiguities may exist between reconstructed objects. To prevent single detector signatures from being

identified as multiple objects, the following overlap removal procedure is applied to baseline leptons and

jets. First, all electrons sharing an ID track with a muon are discarded to remove bremsstrahlung from

muons that is followed by a photon conversion. Second, all jets separated from remaining electrons by less

than  = 0.2 are removed. Also, all jets within  = 0.4 of a muon and associated with fewer than three

tracks

with


T



500

MeV

are

removed.

Finally,

electrons

or

muons

separated

from

surviving

jets

by

less

than  = 0.4 are discarded to reject non-prompt leptons from decays of - and -hadrons.

The missing transverse momentum is defined as the negative vector sum of the transverse momenta of all

baseline objects (electrons, muons, jets, and photons) and an additional soft term [153]. The soft term is

constructed from all tracks that pass basic quality requirements and are associated with the primary vertex,

but are not associated with any baseline object. In this way, the pmT iss is adjusted for the calibration of the

contributing objects, while maintaining robustness against pile-up [154]. Additionally, an `object-based

 miss

significance'

[155]

is

defined

as



|pmT iss

The longitudinal impact parameter, 0, corresponds to the -coordinate distance between the point along the track at which the transverse impact parameter is defined and the primary vertex.

To ensure high-quality object measurement and selection purity for the analysis regions, leptons and jets

must satisfy additional tighter `signal' criteria and isolation requirements to be selected. Signal jets are selected within || < 2.8, and must satisfy Loose quality criteria to reject contamination from non-collision

backgrounds or noise bursts [156]. In order to suppress jets originating from pile-up, signal jet candidates

with


T

<

120

GeV

and

||

<

2.5

(within

the

ID

acceptance)

are

further

required

to

satisfy

the

Medium

working point of the track-based jet vertex tagger (JVT) [150, 157]. For jets with || < 2.5 a multivariate

discriminant ­ constructed using track impact parameters, information about displaced secondary vertices,

and trajectories of - and -hadrons inside the jet [158] ­ is used for the identification of -hadron decays,

referred to as -jets. The -tagging algorithm working point is chosen such that -jets from simulated

¯ events are identified with 85% efficiency, with rejection factors of 2.7 for charm-quark jets and 25 for

light-quark and gluon jets [158]. Signal electrons must satisfy Medium identification criteria [145]. All

signal leptons are then required to be compatible with originating from the primary vertex; the significance

Isolation requirements are applied to suppress contributions from conversions, semileptonic decays of

heavy-flavour hadrons, or hadrons and jets wrongly identified as leptons, collectively referred as fake or

non-prompt (FNP) leptons. The criteria rely on isolation energy variables calculated as


T

of

tracks

or

calo-clusters within a certain size of cone around the lepton candidate; the energy of the lepton candidate

itself is not considered in this calculation. The isolation working points used in this analysis are based on

those described in Refs. [145] and [146], including updates to improve the performance under the increased

pile-up conditions encountered during 2017 and 2018 data-taking. The choice of isolation working points

is optimised per selection region and per lepton-flavour to account for different levels of contribution from

the FNP lepton background. The Tight working point is used for both electrons and muons in the on-shell

 and  selections, while the looser working point Gradient (Loose) is employed for electrons (muons)

in

the

off-shell



selection

to

maintain

a

reasonable

efficiency

down

to

low


T

.

To further suppress FNP lepton backgrounds in the off-shell  selection, a dedicated multivariate

discriminant `non-prompt lepton BDT' [28] is used to tighten the requirements on the lepton with the lowest


T

(which

is

commonly

also

the

most

FNP-like

lepton

of

the

three),

after

selecting

exactly

three

baseline

leptons in the event. The discriminant uses eight input variables including the isolation information,

combined lepton and track quantities, and the -jet likeliness calculated from the energy deposits and tracks

in a cone around the lepton using the DL1mu or RNNIP algorithms [159]. The non-prompt lepton BDT

selection

To account for small efficiency differences between simulation and data, simulated events are corrected with scale factors covering lepton reconstruction, identification, isolation and trigger efficiencies, as well as jet pile-up rejection and flavour-tagging efficiencies.

data events in a region with at least two signal leptons, with the other processes subtracted using the MC samples.

A common preselection is applied for all search regions requiring exactly three signal leptons. Events are also required to have exactly three baseline leptons. This additional baseline requirement ensures orthogonality with other ATLAS SUSY analyses [18, 160, 161] and facilitates statistical combinations; it also simplifies the FNP lepton background estimation. Muons in the region 2.5 < || < 2.7 are exceptionally included in this count if they satisfy all other baseline muon criteria, in order to harmonise with the definition applied in the other analyses.
6 Analysis strategy

The selections in this paper ­ while targeting different simplified model scenarios ­ all consider final states with exactly three leptons, possible ISR jets, and Tmiss. Therefore, a common approach is used throughout most steps of the analyses. The on-shell , off-shell , and  selections are optimised independently.
This section describes the general analysis strategy, introducing the common parts of the search region definitions (Section 6.1), the background estimation (Section 6.2), and the uncertainty treatment (Section 6.3). The statistical methods used are outlined in Section 6.4. Further details specific to either the on-shell  selection and the  selection, or the off-shell  selection, are then discussed in dedicated Sections 7 and 8.

6.1 Search regions

Event selections enriched in signal (signal regions or SRs) are designed independently for the three targeted

models, i.e. for the on-shell , off-shell  or  selections. All the SRs are optimised to the wino/bino

(+)

scenario.

For SRs targeting   -mediated scenarios, two leptons are assigned to the  -boson candidate

by selecting a same-flavour opposite-charge-sign (SFOS) lepton pair in the event, and the remaining
()
lepton is assigned to the  boson (labelled  lepton or W). If more than one SFOS lepton pair is

In -mediated scenarios, the opposite-sign leptons are the indirect product of the Higgs boson decay and

can be of either the same or different flavour. Two subsets of SRs are defined depending on lepton flavour

composition:

the

events

with

at

least

one

pair

(using

and the SRWDhFOS target complementary events without a SFOS lepton pair.

For events with at least one SFOS lepton pair the transverse mass, T, is constructed using the  lepton

use

the first and second slice, respectively, while the SRWShFOS use the first and third slice. The SRWZ are orthogonal

to the

and

the

through the




selection.

The

and

the SRWShFOS

can overlap,

but

are

never used in the same interpretation. The SRWDhFOS are orthogonal to all other SRs through lepton flavour

composition.

For the final selection, a few key discriminating variables are used to further segment and refine the SRs.

Ultimately,

20,

31,

19,

and

2

SR

bins

are

defined

for the SRWZ, SRoffWZ, SRWShFOS, and SRWDhFOS, respectively. The complete definitions of these nominal SRs are

further detailed per selection in subsequent Sections 7.1 (SRWZ and SRWh) and 8.1 (SRoffWZ). The bins within

each subset are explicitly disjoint, and are statistically combined when calculating the constraints on the

target models. A more detailed overview of the fit configuration is given in Section 6.4. Additionally,

discovery-oriented inclusive SRs are designed by grouping sets of adjoining nominal-SR bins in order to

facilitate quantifying the size of data excesses in a model-independent manner. The inclusive-SR definitions

are discussed in Section 9.1.

6.2 Background estimation

The dominant SM background in most of the SRs in this analysis is from SM  events with only leptonic decays, followed in importance by ¯ and +jets processes associated with at least one FNP lepton. In SRWDhFOS, SM Higgs, triboson and ¯ production are the dominant processes.
A partially data-driven method is used for the estimation of the  background, which produces three real and prompt leptons. The background is predicted using MC simulation samples and normalised to data in dedicated control regions (CRs). This normalisation improves the estimation in the phase space of the selections, and constrains the systematic uncertainties. The CRs are designed to be both orthogonal

11

and similar to the SRs, whilst also having little signal contamination; this is achieved by taking the SR definitions and inverting some of the selection criteria. Dedicated validation regions (VRs) are defined kinematically in between the CRs and SRs, and are used to assess the quality of the background estimation and its extrapolation to the SRs. The final estimation of the yields and uncertainties is performed with a simultaneous fit to the CRs and SRs, as discussed in Section 6.4.

The ¯ background is predicted using MC simulation samples and validated in VRs. It is dominated by

decays with a dileptonic final state and an additional lepton from a - or -hadron decay. As the MC

modelling is found to be of good quality, no additional corrections are applied to the MC events. Rare SM

processes, including multiboson and Higgs boson production, top-pair production in association with a

boson, and single-top production, are estimated from MC simulation in all analysis regions.

The (/  ) + (jets/) background has two prompt leptons and one FNP lepton from jets or photons.

In the rest of this document, `+jets' is used to refer to this set of processes. As there are no invisible

particles

in

these

processes

at

tree

level,

the

observed

 miss
T

is

mostly

due

to

mismeasured

leptons

and/or

jets,

or

due

to

the

 miss
T

soft

term.

The

FNP

leptons

originate

from

a

mix

of

sources,

including

light-flavour

jets faking leptons, electrons from photon conversion, and non-prompt leptons from - or -hadron decays.

Such FNP leptons often arise from instrumental effects, hadronisation, and the underlying event, all of

which are challenging to model reliably in simulation. Therefore a data-driven method, referred to as the

`fake-factor method' [162, 163], is used to estimate the +jets background. The fake factor (FF) is defined

as the ratio of the probability for a given lepton candidate to pass the signal lepton requirements to that to fulfil the anti-ID requirements. This is measured using data in a control region, CRFF, designed to target

+jets events with FNP leptons whose sources are representative of those expected in the SRs. Exactly three baseline leptons and at least one SFOS lepton pair are required in CRFF. The -boson candidate in

the event is identified as the SFOS pair yielding the invariant mass closest to the -boson mass, and the

remaining lepton is tagged as the FNP lepton candidate. The two leptons from the -boson candidate must

activate the dilepton trigger to ensure there is no selection bias from FNP leptons. The +jets prediction in

a given region is obtained by applying the FFs to the events in its corresponding `anti-ID region'. This

region is defined by the same selection criteria as used for the nominal region with three signal leptons,

except that at least one of the leptons is anti-ID instead of signal. Each event in the anti-ID region is

scaled by a weight based on the FF assigned to each anti-ID lepton in the region. The FFs are derived

separately

per

lepton

flavour

and

are

parameterised

as

a

function

of

lepton


T

and

lepton



or

 miss
T

in

the

event, depending on the analysis selection. In both the FF measurement and the FF application procedure,

contributions from processes other than +jets are subtracted using MC simulation samples.

While sharing a common approach, the estimation and validation procedures for the main SM backgrounds
were optimised independently for the different selections, which each target a different primary phase-space
region with different relative background composition and importance. Details are given in Section 7.2 (CRWZ/VRWZ) and Section 8.2 (CRoffWZ/VRoffWZ).

6.3 Systematic uncertainties

The analysis considers uncertainties in the predicted yields of signal or background processes due to instrumental systematic uncertainties as well as statistical uncertainties and theoretical systematic uncertainties of the MC simulated samples. Uncertainties are assigned to the yield in each region, except for   processes constrained in CRs, in which case they are assigned to the acceptance in each SR relative to that in the CR. The uncertainty treatment is largely common to the on-shell ,  and off-shell  selections; exceptions are discussed in Sections 7.2 (SRWZ and SRWh) and 8.2 (SRoffWZ). Relative uncertainties are illustrated in a breakdown per SR in the same sections.

12

The dominant instrumental uncertainties are the jet energy scale (JES) and resolution (JER). The jet

uncertainties

are

derived

as

a

function

of


T

and



of

the

jet,

as

well

as

of

the

pile-up

conditions

and

the jet flavour composition of the selected jet sample. They are determined using a combination of

and

studies

in

data,

such

as

measurements

of

the

T

balance

in

det,

 +jet

and

+jet events [151, 152, 164]. Another significant instrumental uncertainty is that in the modelling of

Tmiss, evaluated by propagating the uncertainties in the energy and momentum scale of each of the objects

entering

the

calculation,

as

well

as

the

uncertainties

in

the

 miss
T

soft-term

resolution

and

scale

[153].

Other

instrumental uncertainties concerning the efficiency of the trigger selection, flavour-tagging and JVT, as

well as reconstruction, identification, impact parameter selection and isolation for leptons, are found to

have minor impact. Each experimental uncertainty is treated as fully correlated across the analysis regions

and physics processes considered.

For the processes estimated using the MC simulation, the predicted yield is also affected by different sources

of theoretical modelling uncertainty. All theoretical uncertainties are treated as fully correlated across

analysis regions, except those related to MC statistics. The uncertainties for the dominant background

processes, ,  , and ¯, are derived using MC simulation samples. For the  background, which

is normalised to data in CRs, these uncertainties are implemented as transfer factor uncertainties that

reflect differences in the SR-to-CR or VR-to-CR ratio of yields, and therefore provide an uncertainty in

the assumed shape of MC distributions across analysis regions. The uncertainties related to the choice

of QCD renormalisation and factorisation scales are represented by three Gaussian nuisance parameters

in the fit (see Section 6.4): the first varies the renormalisation scale up and down, where a one-sigma

deviation represents varying that scale up or down by a factor of two, while the factorisation scale is

fixed to its nominal value; the second varies the factorisation scale in the same way while fixing the

renormalisation scale; and the third nuisance coherently varies both the renormalisation and factorisation

scales. There is no nuisance parameter to account for anti-correlated configurations of the renormalisation

and factorisation scales, as these are deemed unphysical. For the  and   samples, the uncertainties

due to the resummation and matching scales between ME and PS as well as the PS recoil scheme are

evaluated by varying the corresponding parameters in S . For ¯, modelling uncertainties at ME and

PS level are determined by comparing the predictions of nominal and alternative generators, considering

P

B versus M G 5_aMC@NLO and P

8 versus H

7 [165, 166], respectively.

Uncertainties in the ¯ prediction due to ISR and final-state radiation (FSR) uncertainties are evaluated

by varying the relevant generator parameters. The uncertainties associated with the choice of PDF set

(NNPDF

[78,

87])

and

the

uncertainty

in

the

strong

coupling

constant,


s

,

are

also

considered

for

the

major backgrounds. Uncertainties in the cross section of 13%, 12%, 10% and 20% are applied for minor

backgrounds ¯, ¯, ¯, and triboson, respectively [109]; for all other rare top processes a conservative

uncertainty of 50% is applied.

The data-driven +jets estimation is subject to the statistical uncertainty due to the limited data sample size in CRFF or in the anti-ID regions used when applying the FF method, the uncertainty due to varying choice of parameterisation, and the uncertainty in the subtraction of non-+jets processes. The uncertainties are evaluated by considering the variations in the FF and propagating the effects to the estimated yields. The prescription applied for the estimation in the off-shell  selection is different from that in the on-shell  and  selections, reflecting the higher presence of +jets in SRoffWZ. Details are included in Sections 7.2 and 8.2.

Uncertainties in the expected yields for SUSY signals are estimated by varying by a factor of two the M G 5_aMC@NLO parameters corresponding to the renormalisation, factorisation and CKKW-L matching scales, as well as the P 8 shower tune parameters. The overall uncertainties in the signal acceptance range from 5% to 20% depending on the analysis region. Uncertainties are smallest in jet-veto

13

regions

and

slightly

larger

for

higher

 miss
T

and

jet-inclusive

regions.

This

uncertainty

estimates

match

the

results of a dedicated study using data and MC    events in Ref. [18].

In the following results, the uncertainties related to experimental effects are grouped and shown as `Experimental' uncertainty. This uncertainty is applied for all processes whose yield is estimated from simulation. The `Modelling' uncertainty groups the uncertainties due to the theoretical uncertainties, including the  transfer factor uncertainties. The `Fakes' group represents the uncertainties for FNP background processes whose yield is estimated from data. `MC stat' stands for the statistical uncertainties of the simulated event samples. Finally, the `Normalisation' group describes the uncertainties related to the normalisation factors derived from the CRs.

6.4 Statistical analysis

Final background estimates are obtained by performing a profile log-likelihood fit [167], implemented in the H F [168] framework, simultaneously on all CRs and SRs relevant to a given interpretation. The statistical and systematic uncertainties are implemented as nuisance parameters in the likelihood; Poisson constraints are used to estimate the uncertainties arising from limited numbers of events in the MC samples or in the data-driven +jets estimation, whilst Gaussian constraints are used for experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties. Neither the VRs, which solely serve to validate the background estimation in the SRs, nor the CRs used for data-driven +jets estimation, are included in any of the fits.
Three types of fit configuration are used to derive the results.
· A `background-only fit' is performed considering only the CRs and assuming no signal presence. The normalisation of the  background is allowed to float and is constrained by the  CRs. The normalisation factors and nuisance parameters are adjusted by maximising the likelihood. The background prediction as obtained from this fit is compared with data in the VRs to assess the quality of the background modelling, as well as in the SRs. The significance of the difference between the observed and expected yields is calculated with the profile likelihood method from Ref. [169], adding a minus sign if the yield is below the prediction.
· A `discovery fit' is performed to derive model-independent constraints, setting upper limits on the new-physics cross section. The fit considers the target single-bin SR and the associated CRs, constraining the backgrounds by following the same method as in the background-only fit. Considering only one SR at a time avoids introducing a dependence on the signal model, which may arise from correlations across multiple SR bins. A signal contribution is allowed only in the SR, and a non-negative signal-strength parameter assuming generic beyond-the-SM (BSM) signals is derived.
· An `exclusion fit' is performed to set exclusion limits on the target models. The backgrounds are again constrained by following the same method as in the background-only fit, considering the CRs and the SRs, and the signal contribution to each region participating in the fit is taken into account according to the model predictions.
For each discovery or exclusion fit, the compatibility of the observed data with the signal-plus-background hypotheses is checked using the CLs prescription [170], and limits on the cross section are set at 95% confidence level (CL).
Following the independent optimisation of the CRs and SRs, the simultaneous fits are performed separately for the different selections: once for the on-shell  and  selections combined, and once for the off-shell  selection. The results are presented in Section 9.

14

The new results of the on-shell and off-shell  searches, as well as the results of a previous ATLAS search for electroweak SUSY with compressed mass spectra [18], are statistically combined and interpreted in the simplified models discussed in Section 1. Exclusion limits are calculated by statistically combining the results from the signal regions of the contributing searches, which are designed to be orthogonal. The combination is implemented in the pyhf framework [171, 172], which was validated against the H F framework [173]. The results are presented in Section 9.2.

7 On-shell  and  selections

The following subsections discuss the implementation specific to the on-shell  selection and the  selection, expanding on the general strategy outlined in Section 6. The selection is applied on top of the common preselection as defined in Section 5, and the SRs are optimised to the wino/bino (+) scenario.

7.1 Search regions

The SRWZ and SRWh selections as introduced in Section 6.1 are further refined, taking into consideration

differences in signal and background kinematics and composition.

Events

with

at

least

one

SFOS

lepton

pair

are

divided

into

three




bins,

in

order

to

separate

processes

that

include a  boson in the decay chain from processes where a SM Higgs boson is involved. The first bin is

defined as the -boson mass window (  [75, 105] GeV), and is used for the SRWZ selection. The second

and

third

bins

are

defined

below

and

above

the

 -boson

mass

(



75

GeV

and






105

GeV),

and

are used for the SRWShFOS selection. The -boson mass window bin is expected to contain a larger irreducible

SM background contribution than the other bins.

Each




bin

is

further

divided

into


T

and

 miss
T

bins,

which

enhances

the

sensitivity

to

various



scenarios.

The


T

distribution

falls

steeply

in

the

region

around

the

 -boson

mass,

and

facilitates

discrimination

against

the

background

from

SM



production.

Three


T

bins,


T

<

100,

100




T



160,

and


T

>

160

GeV,

are

defined

to

separate

processes

with

and

without

a

leptonic

 -boson

decay.

The

lower

and

upper

bounds

on

the

 miss
T

bins

vary

with

the




and


T

thresholds.

The

SM

background

contribution

is

expected

to

be

higher

in

low


T

and

 miss
T

bins,

while

the

signal

populates

different


T

and

 miss
T

bins,

depending

on

the

mass

splitting.

Signals

with

smaller



tend

to

have

more

events

in

the

lower

 miss
T

and


T

range,

shifting

to

higher

 miss
T

and


T

bins

as

the

mass

difference

increases.

Furthermore, events are separated by jet multiplicity, with jet-veto (jets = 0; SRWZ-1 to 8, SRWShFOS-1 to 7 and 17 to 19) and jet-inclusive (jets > 0; SRWZ-9 to 20, SRWShFOS-8 to 16) SRs. The ISR topology is exploited further in the jet-inclusive regions of SRWZ and SRWShFOS by categorising the events with at least one jet

according

to

their

T,

the

scalar


T

sum

of

the

jets

with


T

>

20

GeV.

At

higher

T,

signals

with

mass

splitting






Z

tend

to

have

more

events

at

high

values

of

 miss
T

and


T

than

the

SM

background,

due

to

the

recoil

against

ISR

jets.

In

the

high


T

(T

>

200

GeV)

regions,

softer

lepton-


T

spectra

are

expected

for the signal because of the presence of a massive 10, which carries most of the transverse momenta of

the

boosted

±


0

12

system.

Therefore

Tlep,

the

scalar


T

sum

of

the

three

selected

leptons,

is

required

to

be

less

than

350

GeV.

The


T

categorisation

is

applied

in

regions

with




<

105

GeV.

Finally,

in

the

high-mass off-peak region (  105 GeV), only jet-veto events are considered. The full set of 20 SRWZ

and 19 SRWShFOS signal regions is summarised in Tables 3 and 4.

In the SRWDhFOS regions, events are required to have one same-flavour same-charge-sign (SFSS) lepton pair as well as a third lepton which has a different flavour and opposite sign to the SFSS pair, and is referred to as

the DFOS lepton. After this selection, ¯ production dominates the SM background and is minimised by

keeping events with low jet multiplicity (jets < 3). These are then further split into two SR bins, one with


jets

=

0

(SRWDhFOS-1)

and

the

other

satisfying


jets



[1,

2]

(SRWDhFOS-2).

Due

to

the

presence

of

the

10,

signals

tend

to

have

higher

 miss
T

significance

than

the

SM

background,

and

therefore

the

events

are

required

to

have

 miss
T

significance

>

8.

The

third

lepton

in

¯

production

usually

arises

from

a

heavy

flavour

quark

decay

and

is

typically

lower

in


T

than

the

third

lepton

in

the

SUSY

signal

scenarios.

To

reduce

this

contribution

the

lower

bound

on

the

third

lepton's


T

is

increased

to

15

and

20

GeV

in

the

SRWDhFOS-1

and

SRWDhFOS-2

regions, respectively. Angular proximity between leptons coming from a Higgs-boson decay is used for

further

event

separation,

using

the

variable




OS,near

,

defined

as

the



between

the

DFOS

lepton

and

the

SFSS lepton nearest in . The signal is expected to populate the lower range in OS,near, while the SM

background

tends

to

have

a

flatter

distribution.

Events

in

SRWDhFOS-1

are

required

to

satisfy


OS,near

<

1.2.

To suppress the higher ¯ contribution in the SRWDhFOS-2, a tighter selection on OS,near is imposed. A

The

is

the  CRs and VRs is presented in Table 6. The  purity is about 80% in all CRs and VRs. The signal

contamination is almost negligible in the CRs and increases to 10% in the VRs.

Performing the simultaneous background-only fit for the on-shell  and  selections, normalisation factors for  of 1.07 ± 0.02 (CRWZW0jZ), 0.94 ± 0.03 (CRWZWlZow-HT) and 0.85 ± 0.05 (CRWZWhZigh-HT) are found.

A

good

description

of

the


T

and

 miss
T

distributions

in

the



simulation

is

crucial

in

this

analysis,

especially

in

the

high-T

and

high-Tmiss

tails

where

new

physics

may

appear.

The

tail

of

the


T

distribution

is a result of, in decreasing order of importance: the use of a wrong pair of leptons to compute the mass

of

the

 -boson

candidate

and

the


T

of

the



-boson

candidate

(`mis-pairing'

of

the

leptons),

the

 miss
T

resolution, and the -boson width. The prediction of lepton mis-pairing in simulation is validated in

a control sample in data similar to the one used to calculate the cross-section normalisation factor, but

only allowing events with a SFOS pair of different flavour than the  lepton. The -boson candidate

can then be identified unambiguously, and a mis-paired control sample is obtained using the DFOS pair

in

the




computation

and

using

the

third

lepton

to

calculate

T.

Finally,

the

modelling

of

the


T

and

 miss
T

distributions

is

validated

in

a

 +

control

sample.

The

 +

and



processes

have

very

similar


T

shapes

because

their

production

mechanisms

are

similar,

with

the

exception

that

the

FSR

production

diagram of + is much more common than the corresponding diagram in , which is doubly suppressed

due to the mass of the  boson and its weak coupling to leptons. Furthermore, a photon is a good proxy for

a leptonically decaying  boson since photons and leptons are reconstructed with comparable resolutions,

and no large extra mismeasurements are expected. The enhancement of the FSR diagram in the +

process

leads

to

differences

in

the


T

distribution

shapes

between



and

 +.

When

a

photon

is

radiated,

leptons

lose

energy,

resulting

in

a

lower

T.

In

order

to

use

the

 +


T

shape

to

validate

the



MC

prediction, the FSR contribution in the + control region has to be suppressed. This is done by placing



threshold

requirements

on

the


T

of

the

photon,


T

>

50

GeV,

and

the

separation

between

the

lepton

and

the photon, (, ) > 0.4, in + events, as FSR photons are expected to be close to the lepton radiating

them

and

also

tend

to

have

low

T.

The

distribution

shapes

of


T

and

Tmiss,

as

well

as

other

kinematic

variables,

are

compared

in

data

and

MC

events

in

the

 +

region.

The


T

distribution

in

the

validation

region with mis-paired leptons and the + validation region are shown in Figure 3. Good agreement in

both

control

samples

is

observed

and

no

extra

corrections

or

scale

factors

are

applied

to

correct

the


T

distribution for the  background.

The ¯ MC modelling is validated in VRs, enhancing the ¯ contribution by requiring a DFOS lepton pair

and

using

a

moderate

 miss
T

>

50

GeV

selection.

The

main

VR,

VRtt¯ WZ,

requires

the

presence

of

one

or

two

-jets,

further

increasing

the

¯

contribution.

To

validate

the

modelling

in

the


jets

=

0

region

as

well,

an

additional

VR

inclusive

in

-jets,

VRtt¯ WinZcl,

is

considered,

with

a

 miss
T

significance

<

8

requirement

to

ensure orthogonality with the SRWDhFOS regions. The ¯ purity is about 80% in the VRtt¯WZ and 72% in the

VRtt¯WinZcl. The selection requirements for the ¯ VRs are summarised in Table 7.

The +jets estimation uses the FF method as described in Section 6.2. For measurement region CRFFWZ, the

 -boson

candidate

mass

must

be

compatible

with

the

 -boson

mass

within

15

GeV,

and

low

 miss
T

and


T

are required to minimise  contributions. The typical value of FFs varies from 0.2 to 0.4, depending on

the

lepton


T

and

.

The

 +jets

estimation

is

then

validated

in

VRFFWZ,

considering

the

intermediate

 miss
T

range

closer

to,

but

orthogonal

to,

the

SRs,

and

adding

a


3

lower

bound

to

reduce



contamination.

The selection criteria for CRFFWZ as well as those of VRFFWZ are summarised in Table 7.

Figure 4: Comparison of the observed data and expected SM background yields in the CRs (pre-fit) and VRs (post-fit) of the on-shell  and  selections. The `Others' category contains the single-top, , triboson, Higgs and rare top processes. The hatched band indicates the combined theoretical, experimental, and MC statistical uncertainties. The bottom panel shows the relative difference between the observed data and expected yields for the CRs and the significance of the difference for the VRs, calculated with the profile likelihood method from Ref. [169], adding a minus sign if the yield is below the prediction.

The systematic uncertainties considered in the on-shell  and the  SRs follow the approach discussed in Section 6.3. The relative composition of FNP muons is similar between the CRFF and SRWZ, whereas for FNP electrons the main source in the SRWZ is photon conversions, while in the CRFF the heavy-flavour decay
contribution dominates. An additional source of uncertainty that is considered accounts for the different FNP lepton compositions in the CRFF and SRWZ. This uncertainty arises from the method's performance in
the simulation (closure) in various regions of parameter space and is given by the differences between
the estimated and simulated yields of events in the given region. In the DFOS region where the triboson
contribution becomes dominant, the uncertainties related to the QCD renormalisation and factorisation
scales are also evaluated for this background component, in the same way as previously described for diboson and ¯. A summary of the considered systematic uncertainties is presented in Figure 5, with
uncertainties grouped as discussed in Section 6.3.

Bin-to-bin fluctuations in the statistical uncertainty as well as the experimental uncertainty reflect the

difference in expected yields in the various search regions, which varies by an order of magnitude.

These uncertainties become the dominant ones in SRWZ-3 4, 6 8, 11 12 and 15 16 of the on-shell 

selection, and SRWShFOS-5, SRWShFOS-14, and SRWShFOS-19 of the  selection, due to limited number of MC events

at

high

 miss
T

and

T.

Although

the

FNP

lepton

uncertainty

is

negligible

in

the

majority

of

the

search

bins,

its relative size reaches 30% in SRWDhFOS-2, due to the small number of events in the corresponding anti-ID

sample.

8 Off-shell  selection

The following subsections discuss the implementation specific to the off-shell  selection, expanding on the general strategy outlined in Section 6. The selection is applied on top of the common preselection as defined in Section 5, and the SRs are optimised to the wino/bino (+) scenario.

8.1 Search regions

The SRoffWZ selection targets the off-shell 

region

by

requiring

min,


max


<

75 GeV.

The

max


is

the largest SFOS lepton pair invariant mass in the event, and the double requirement helps to maximally

suppress combinatorial backgrounds with an on-shell  boson. Further variables used in the off-shell



selection

assume

min-based

lepton

assignment

to

the


-

and


 -boson

candidates

unless

otherwise

indicated. The event preselection vetoes events with a -jet to reduce contamination from ¯, requires

the

three

leptons

to

be

well

separated

in

min

3

=

min

[



(


,





)

;

for

all

lepton

pairs

(


,





)]

,

and

requires

a

lower

bound

on

min


of

1

GeV

to

remove

events

with

collimated

leptons

for

which

FNP

lepton

background

estimation

is

challenging.

Finally,

min


mass

ranges

of

[3.0,

3.2]

and

[9,

12]

GeV

are

vetoed

to avoid contributions from / and  resonance backgrounds associated with a FNP lepton, except in the

jet-inclusive

high

 miss
T

regions

(Tmiss

>

200

GeV)

where

the

contribution

is

negligible.

Preselected

events

are

further

divided

into

four

categories

based

on

the

multiplicity

of

jets

with


T

>

30

GeV

(3je0tsGeV), and on Tmiss. Jet-veto categories SRolfofwEW/TZ-0j and SRohfifgWhEZ/T-0j reject events containing jets and select

low

and

high

 miss
T

,

respectively.

Jet-inclusive

categories

SRolfofwWE/TZ-nj

and

SRohfifgWhEZ/T -nj

require

at

least

one

jet

and due

also separate the events with low and high

to

the

recoil

between

the

±
1

0
2

system

and

Tmiss.

As

the

 miss
T

is

the jets, the boundary

harder in between

the the

jet-inclusive low and high

categories,

 miss
T

bins

is set at 50 GeV for the jet-veto categories and at 200 GeV for the jet-inclusive categories. The SRolfofwWE/TZ-0j,

SRolfofwEW/TZ-nj and SRohfifgWhEZ/T-0j primarily target signals with moderate mass splitting (  [40, 90] GeV), and

rely mostly on moderate kinematics and lepton triggers. The SRohfifgWhEZ/T-nj also target signals with highly

compressed mass spectra ( 40 GeV) ­ resulting in events with very soft leptons ­ by exploiting events

with

large

 miss
T

recoiling

against

hard

hadronic

activity.

Initial

lepton


T

requirements

are

kept

as

loose

as

possible,


T

SRohfifgWhEZ/T -nj ;

> 10 GeV for SRolfofwWE/TZ-0j, SRolfofwWE/TZ-nj, however, the selection is restricted by

and

SRohfifgWhEZ/T -0j,

and

requirements are applied in the bin-by-bin SR optimisation as discussed in the following.

For SRolfofwWE/TZ, events are

then treated separately for different flavours of the lepton from the -boson decay (W), selected using

  -based lepton assignment to best capture the SM background topology for rejection. To suppress the


contribution from  (+)   caused by bremsstrahlung from prompt electrons and subsequent photon

conversions,

while

the efficiency for  = 10 GeV signals is > 95%.

Event selection is tightened further by employing various background rejection criteria, optimised separately

and

each

The

variables

used

and

the

In order to reduce the FNP lepton background contributions from +jets and ¯, lepton T thresholds

are raised in SRolfofwWE/TZ-0j, SRolfofwWE/TZ-nj and SRohfifgWhEZ/T-0j. In these same three categories, the transverse mass

used

to

8.2 Background estimation

The selection criteria for the CRs and the VRs for  estimation are summarised in Table 10. An on-shell

 boson (  [81, 101] GeV) is required to ensure orthogonality to the SRoffWZ, and an upper bound on

 miss
T

ensures

orthogonality

to

the

SRWZ.

A

lower

bound

on


T

is

applied

to

suppress

the

 +jets

background.

The CRs are further split into two bins (CRWZo0jffWZ and CRWZonjffWZ), based on the absence or presence of jets,

to constrain  events without or with hard ISR jets separately with individual normalisation factors.

Three

validation

regions

are

defined

in

the

region

with

min,





<

75 GeV, similar to SRoffWZ.

First,

VRWZo0jffWZ and VRWZonjffWZ are designed to validate the  estimation in the SRolfofwWE/TZ phase space. A window

in


T

around

the

Jacobian

peak

(T



[60, 90]

GeV)

is

selected

to

enhance

,

as

well

as

to

ensure

the orthogonality with respect to the SRs. Further kinematic selection criteria similar to those in SRolfofwWE/TZ

are applied. Two additional variables are employed in the VRWZo0jffWZ to suppress the signal contamination

in

the

region.

The -boson

mass,

reco
W

WZ,

is

reconstructed

assuming

the



topology

and

balanced



longitudinal

momenta

of

the



and



bosons,

and



(

T

is

defined

by

( ,

 miss)2
T

where

leptons

are

assigned

according

to

the

min


approach,

and


W

is

the

lepton

associated

with

the



boson.

Since

reco WZ
W

peaks

around




with

a

long

tail

to

higher

masses

for 

background,

while

signals tend

to

have

a

flatter

distribution,

reco WZ
W

>

75

GeV

is

found

to

effectively

reduce

signal

contamination.

In

the

very

low

min


region,

VRWZonjf-flWoZwmll

is

used

to

validate

the



estimation

in

the

SRohfifgWhEZ/T

phase

space.

This

region

has

the

low-mass

resonance

veto

applied

and

a

lower

bound

on

|plep
T

|/ miss
T

to

ensure

orthogonality with the SRs. Other kinematic cuts are loosened relative to SRohfifgWhEZ/T, or removed entirely, to

increase the number of data events in the region. The  purity is 85%­90% in the CRs and 70%­75% in

the VRs. The contamination from the benchmark signals is negligible in the CRs and below 15% in the

VRs.

The VRtt¯offWZ selection criteria are summarised in Table 10. At least one -jet is required to maintain

orthogonality

with

the

SRs,

 miss
T

>

50

GeV

is

required

to

suppress

the

 +jets

contribution,

and

the

low-mass resonance background veto is applied. The ¯ purity in this region is approximately 65%.

The +jets background is estimated using the FF method as described in Section 6.2. The FF measurement

region for the off-shell  selection, CRFFoffWZ, is summarised in Table 11. The -boson candidate is

selected

by

requiring

and

 miss
T

<

GeV

and


T

<

30

GeV

are

applied

to

reject

contamination

from

.

Additionally


3

>

105

GeV

is

applied

to

suppress





4.

To

increase

the

number of FNP lepton candidates at high T, the overlap removal procedure described in Section 5 is

modified for this FF measurement so that muons overlapping with jets are always kept. Finally, a jet veto is

applied

except

for

events

where

the

FNP

lepton

candidate

is

a

muon

with


T

>

30

GeV,

in

which

case

is

required

in

order

to

account

for

the

special

muon-vs-jet

overlap-removal

treatment

applied

to

this region.

The FFs are derived separately per lepton flavour of FNP lepton candidates and per signal lepton criterion,

i.e.

with

or

without

applying

the

non-prompt

BDT,

and

are

parameterised

as

a

function

of

lepton


T

and

 miss
T

in

the

event.

Typical

FF

values

are

0.2­0.4

(0.2­0.6)

without

the

BDT

applied,

and

0.05­0.2

(0.07­0.2) when applying the BDT, for electrons (muons) in a


T

range of 4.5­30 (3.0­30) GeV.

The

parameterisation

in

 miss
T

is

used

to

reflect

the

variation

of

FNP

lepton

source

with

Tmiss,

which

is

required

in

order

to

model

the

shape

of

fake

 miss
T

correctly.

Typically

the

fraction

of

FNP

leptons

originating

from

heavy-flavour

decays

varies

with

 miss
T

,

in

the

range

20%­30%

(60%­70%)

for

electrons

(muons),

because

of the neutrinos from the leptonic -/-decays.

The contribution of non-+jets processes is subtracted using MC simulated samples. A small normalisation correction is applied to the ¯ events in the simulated anti-ID region to account for the different anti-ID lepton efficiencies in data and MC simulation. Normalisation factors are derived separately depending

on

the


W

flavour

and

the

-jet multiplicity

in

the

event.

They

are

measured

using

the

data

events

in

a

¯-enriched control region, CRtt¯oanftfi-WIZD, and are found to be between 0.88 and 0.95. The CRtt¯oanftfi-WIZD selection

requires

there

to

event,

as

well

as


3
T

and

to

enhance the ¯ purity.

Two sources of uncertainty specific to the estimation in SRoffWZ are considered in addition to those described

in

Section

6.3.

The

FF

parameterisation

uncertainty

is

evaluated

from

the

effect

of

using

a

different

 miss
T

binning

(Tmiss

<

50

GeV,

50%

larger

bin

size),

or

a

3D

parameterisation

in

lepton

T,

 miss
T

and

lepton

,

additionally taking into account the dependency on lepton . The impact on the +jets background yields

in the CRs is  5%, and 1%­7% in the SRs/VRs. The uncertainty from disabling the muon-vs-jet overlap

removal procedure in the FF measurement region is assessed by comparing those FFs with alternative FFs

measured

with

muon-vs-jet

overlap

removal

applied

for

events

with

a

FNP

muon

candidate

of


T

<

30

GeV.

The variation in the estimated +jets yields in the SRs/CRs/VRs is found to be 5%­15%.

The yields predicted by the FF method are cross-checked in dedicated VRs enriched in FNP lepton

backgrounds,

as

summarised

in

Table

11.

The

 miss
T

significance

selection

is

inverted

with

respect

to

the

SRs to ensure orthogonality. First, VRFFo0jffWZ and VRFFonjffWZ are designed to validate the yields in SRolfofwWE/TZ-0j

and SRolfofwWE/TZ-nj, respectively, while VRFFonjf-flWoZwpT aims to cross-check the modelling of FNP leptons with


T

<

10

GeV

specifically.

The

 +jets

purity

is

in

the

VRs

is

50%­80%,

while

the

contamination

from

signals is negligible.

Performing the background-only fit,  normalisation factors of 1.06 ± 0.03 (CRWZo0jffWZ) and 0.93 ± 0.03 (CRWZonjffWZ) are determined. Examples of kinematic distributions in the CRs and VRs, demonstrating good agreement, are presented in Figure 7. Observed and expected yields for all CRs and VRs are summarised
in Figure 8.

The systematic uncertainties considered in the off-shell  selection are summarised in Figure 9, grouped
as discussed in Section 6.3. As the expected yields can vary by an order of magnitude throughout the
regions, bin-to-bin fluctuations are expected in both the statistical and experimental uncertainty; these
uncertainties are often dominant in bins with limited MC statistics in the phase space of the selection.
The FNP lepton uncertainty is naturally more important in bins with larger FNP lepton background
contributions, and can fluctuate in bins with few events in the corresponding anti-ID sample, such as SRohfifgWhEZ/T-0jb and SRohfifgWhEZ/T-njb. The modelling uncertainty is larger in the presence of ISR jets and at higher values of Tmiss; the fluctuation in SRolfofwEW/TZ-njg2 originates from the effect of the QCD scale uncertainty on the  background.

9 Results

The observed data in the on-shell , off-shell , and  SRs are compared with the background

expectation obtained from the background-only fits described in Section 6.4. The results are summarised in Tables 12­13 as well as visualised in Figures 10­11 for the SRWZ and SRWh regions, and in Tables 14­15 and Figure 12 for the SRoffWZ. Post-fit distributions of key kinematic observables are shown for the SRWZ and SRWh regions in Figure 13 and for the SRoffWZ regions in Figure 14.

splittings; for the lowest mass-splitting signals, only SRohfifgWhEZ/T-nja has sensitivity.

No significant deviation from the SM background prediction is found in any of the SRs, and none of
the deviations agree with any of the benchmark signal hypotheses. The maximum deviation of the data from the background expectation is in SRolfofwWE/TZ-0jd with a 2.3 data excess, followed by a 2.1 deficit in SRohfifgWhEZ/T-0jf2, a 2.0 excess in SRWDhFOS-1, and a 2.0 deficit in SRWZ-5; the significances are computed following the profile likelihood method in Ref. [169].

Table 13: Observed and expected yields after the background-only fit in the SRs for the  selection. The normalisation factors of the  sample are extracted separately for the 0j, low-HT and high-HT regions, and are treated separately in the combined fit. The `Others' category contains the single-top, , ¯+ and rare top
processes. Combined statistical and systematic uncertainties are presented.

 of


signals are overlaid, with mass values the difference between the observed and

expected yields, calculated with the profile likelihood method from Ref. [169], adding a minus sign if the yield is

below the prediction.

9.1 Model-independent limits on new physics in inclusive regions

Model-independent upper limits and discovery -values in the SRs are derived by performing the discovery

fits as described in Section 6.4. The set of single-bin signal regions used in the fits, referred to as `inclusive

SRs', is constructed by logically grouping adjoining, disjoint, nominal SRs of the on-shell ,  and

off-shell  selections. Multiple, sometimes overlapping, regions are defined to capture signatures with

different

unknown

min


shapes

and

jet

multiplicities

inclusively.

Based

on

the

best

expected

discovery

sensitivity and using a number of signal points covering both the - and -mediated scenarios and

different mass splittings, 12 inclusive SRs are formed by merging SRWZ and SRWh regions, creating incSRWZ

and incSRWh, respectively. They are summarised in Table 16. Similarly, 17 inclusive SRs are formed by

merging SRoffWZ regions, creating incSRoffWZ; their definitions are summarised in Table 17. For incSRoffWZ,

contiguous

jet-veto

regions

are

merged

with

jet-inclusive

regions,

as

the

min


shape

of

a

signal

is

assumed

to be insensitive to jet multiplicity. The SRolfofwWE/TZ and SRohfifgWhEZ/T regions are kept separate, while the SRohfifgWhEZ/T-nj

regions

are

considered

separately

for

min


<

20

GeV,

as

this

selection

provides

the

best

sensitivity

to

low-mass-splitting models.

The 95% CL upper limits on the generic BSM cross section are calculated by performing a discovery fit for
each target SR and its associated CRs, using pseudo-experiments. Results are reported in Table 18 (19) for
the on-shell  and  analysis selections (off-shell  selection). The tables list the observed (obs) and expected (exp) yields in the inclusive SRs, the upper limits on the observed (o9b5s) and expected (e9x5p) number of BSM events, and the visible cross section (v9i5s) reflecting the product of the production cross section, the acceptance, and the selection efficiency for a BSM process; the -value and significance ()
for the background-only hypothesis are also presented.

9.2 Constraints on - and -mediated models

Constraints on the target simplified models are derived using the nominal SRs discussed in Sections 7.1 and 8.1. The results are statistically combined with the previous results for the electroweakino regions (SR-E) of the two-lepton search targeting compressed mass spectra [18], referred to as the compressed selection. Model-dependent 95% CL exclusion limits are calculated by performing the exclusion fits as described in Section 6.4. When performing the combination, common experimental uncertainties are treated as correlated between regions and processes. Theoretical uncertainties of the background and signal are treated as correlated between regions only, while statistical uncertainties are considered uncorrelated between regions and processes.

All regions of the on-shell , off-shell , and compressed selections were explicitly designed to be

orthogonal, allowing a statistical combination of the results. The on-shell and off-shell  selections are

orthogonal

due

to

the




and

 miss
T

requirements,

while

the

off-shell



and

compressed

selections

are

orthogonal by lepton multiplicity. Results are combined where greater exclusion power is expected over the

individual results, ignoring contributions from search regions that do not add sensitivity in a given region

of phase space. This approach results in multiple pairwise combinations of the on-shell and off-shell  selections, and the off-shell  and compressed selections, in bands of the (, ( ~20 )) plane.

Four separate fits are performed to obtain constraints for the following simplified models: · the wino/bino (+) -mediated model combining the on-shell , off-shell , and compressed selections, · the wino/bino (+) -mediated model using the  selection only, · the wino/bino (-) -mediated model combining the off-shell  and compressed selections, · the higgsino -mediated model combining the off-shell  and compressed selections.

For the -mediated model in the wino/bino (+) scenario, only the SRWZ are sensitive for mass splittings  above 100 GeV. Conversely, the SRoffWZ dominate the intermediate mass-splitting region, with sensitivity in the  = [5, 100] GeV range. In the most compressed region, the SR-E are important, driving the result
for  below 10 GeV and adding sensitivity up to  = 50 GeV. Given these contributions, the  range

is split into five bands: [<8, 8­28, 28­78, 78­108, >108] GeV. In each of these bands the combination considers respectively the SR-E only, the SR-E and SRoffWZ, the SRoffWZ only, the SRoffWZ and SRWZ, and the SRWZ only. In the wino/bino (-) scenario, the on-shell  selection is not used, and three bands are defined

for the combination as [<8, 8­28, >28] GeV. In the higgsino scenario, the mass-splitting range is restricted to   60 GeV for model consistency, and the on-shell  selection is not used. The combination is
defined using three bands: [<8, 8­42, >42] GeV, respectively considering the SR-E only, the SR-E and SRoffWZ, and the SRoffWZ only. The ranges used are illustrated for the different scenarios in Figure 15.

shown in Figure 16 (-mediated model) and Figure 17 (-mediated model). The combined results are

shown together with the individual contributions. For each mass point, a CLs value is derived to assess the probability of compatibility between the observed data and the signal-plus-background prediction obtained

by the exclusion fit. For the -mediated model, the results are obtained by statistically combining the SRWZ, SRoffWZ and SR-E contributions, following the prescription outlined above. For the -mediated model, the results are taken from a simultaneous fit of the 19 bins of SRWh.

by the combination with the compressed selection, up to 240 GeV for  = 10 GeV, and down to as low

as

for

Furthermore,

constraints

are

calculated

in

the

bino­wino

co-annihilation dark-matter scenario by determining the area in the two-dimensional mass plane that yields

a thermal dark-matter relic density equal to the observed value [176]. Figure 16 (top right) shows this

are

excluded in this dark-matter scenario up to 210 (195) GeV.

The obtained wino/bino (+) exclusion limits are greatly improved compared to the previous equivalent search presented by the ATLAS experiment using the Run 1, 8 TeV dataset [17] (shown as a light grey shaded area in Figure 16, top panels), due to a combination of increased production cross section at the increased collision centre-of-mass energy, larger data sample, and improved analysis techniques.

Expected and observed exclusion contours are also derived for the -mediated model in the wino/bino

and

scenarios,

in

The results are obtained by statistically combining the SRoffWZ and SR-E contributions, following the

prescription outlined above.

10 Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction selection and results

To follow up on an earlier ATLAS search performed using the Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction (RJR) technique with the 2015­2016, 36 fb-1 dataset [15], the search in this paper includes two signal regions
in which the original search observed excesses of three-lepton events. The original search in the two
regions is repeated following the same methods, updated to use the full Run 2 dataset. The SR3-Low rine1±gSioR20n3ptra-orLgdoeuwtcstailnoodnw-iSmnRaa3ssss-owIcSiianRtoio/obbnisnweorivt(he+d)ISinR1±tha2n0edp3r6mofdabsu-sc1tdiroieffnse,urwletnhccioleersrtehsepSonRne3dart-otIhlSoeRcarl-ebsgoiigosnoninfitamcraganesctsse. swToihnfeo2/e.bx1icneosas(ne+ds)
3.0, respectively.

The RJR technique endeavours to resolve the ambiguities inherent in reconstructing original particles for

event decays including invisible particles, e.g. SUSY particles. By analysing the event starting from the

laboratory frame and boosting back to the parent particle's rest frame, assuming given decay chains, the

technique

can

resolve

the

±

1

and

0
2

particles.

For

this

search,

both

the

standard

decay

tree

applied

to

a three-lepton final state (representing the decay of pair-produced sparticles into a final state with two

invisible objects and three leptons, in the laboratory frame) and the ISR decay tree (representing the decay

of an intermediate sparticle into a visible and an invisible component, recoiling from ISR activity, in

the centre-of-mass frame) are considered. Using the reconstructed leptons, jets, and missing transverse

momentum as inputs, the algorithm assigns each particle to a parent sparticle. ISR jets are selected by

minimising the invariant mass of the system formed by the candidate jets and the sparticle system, in the

centre-of-mass frame. The algorithm then determines the smallest Lorentz-invariant configuration of the

particles' four-momenta guaranteeing a non-negative mass parameter for the invisible particles. Finally,

object or frame momenta and derived variables can be considered in each of the different frames of each

decay tree.

44

The search in the RJR selection regions follows a similar strategy for background estimation, systematic uncertainty treatment, and statistical interpretation to that outlined for the on-shell , off-shell , and  selections in Section 6. For the search in SR3-Low (SR3-ISR), the SM diboson background is taken from MC simulation samples and normalised in a dedicated control region CR3-VV (CR3-ISR-VV) and validated in a validation region VR3-VV (VR3-ISR-VV). The selection criteria for each of the regions follow the original search [15], except for an additional jet-veto (jets = 0) in CR3-VV and VR3-VV which guarantees the orthogonality between the low-mass and ISR regions. The FNP lepton background component, including ¯, ,  and +jets SM background contributions, is estimated in a data-driven way using the matrix method [177]. The method derives the number of events with one or two FNP leptons by relating the yields for tighter (signal tagged) and looser (baseline tagged) lepton identification criteria. The result is a function of the real-lepton identification efficiencies and the FNP lepton misidentification probabilities. The remaining SM backgrounds, including multiboson and Higgs boson production, and top-pair production in association with a boson, are estimated from MC simulation in all analysis regions. Beyond the treatment of experimental and theoretical systematical uncertainties following the general strategy in Section 6.3, uncertainties are assigned to the matrix-method FNP lepton background estimation, accounting for limited numbers of events in the measurement region, potentially different compositions (heavy flavour, light flavour, or conversions) between SRs and CRs, and the uncertainty from the subtraction of prompt-lepton contributions using MC simulation samples.
Performing the background-only fit, diboson normalisation factors of 0.92±0.07 (CR3-VV) and 0.92±0.05 (CR3-ISR-VV) are determined. Observed and expected yields for all CRs and VRs are summarised in Figure 18 and a summary of the considered systematic uncertainties is presented in Figure 19, grouped as discussed in Section 6.3.

carried by the invisible system, ISR, in the centre-of-mass (CM) frame and assuming the ISR decay tree.
Good agreement with the background-only hypothesis is observed in both SRs. The deviations from the SM expectation as found in the 36 fb-1 result are reduced and no longer significant when including the additional 103 fb-1 of data from the 2017­2018 datasets.

Model-independent results for SR3-Low and SR3-ISR are shown in Table 21. The 95% CL upper limits
on the generic BSM cross section are calculated by performing a discovery fit for each target SR and its associated CR, using pseudo-experiments. The table lists the upper limits on the observed (o9b5s) and expected (e9x5p) number of BSM events in the inclusive SRs, and the visible cross section (v9i5s) reflecting the product of the production cross section, the acceptance, and the selection efficiency for a BSM process;
the -value and significance () for the background-only hypothesis are also presented.

11 Conclusion


Results of a search for chargino­neutralino pair production decaying via ,   or  into three-lepton final states are presented. A dataset of  = 13 TeV proton­proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb-1, collected by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN LHC, is used. Events with three
light-flavour charged leptons and missing transverse momentum are preselected, and three selections are

developed with a signal region strategy optimised for chargino­neutralino signals decaying via ,  
and , respectively. A fourth selection targeting the chargino­neutralino signals decaying via  using
the Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction technique is also studied, to follow up on the excesses observed in
the previous ATLAS result using the same method and event selection. In all the selections the data are
found to be consistent with predictions of the Standard Model. The results are interpreted for simplified
models with wino or higgsino production. A statistical combination is performed to include the result of an
ATLAS search probing the final state with two soft leptons using the same dataset.
