GILLES CARRON, JØRGEN OLSEN LYE, AND BORIS VERTMAN
Abstract. In this work, we study the convergence of the normalized Yamabe flow with positive Yamabe constant on a class of pseudo-manifolds that includes stratified spaces with iterated cone-edge metrics. We establish convergence under a low-energy condition. We also prove a concentration­compactness dichotomy, and investigate what the alternatives to convergence are. We end by investigating a non-convergent example due to Viaclovsky in more detail.

1. Introduction and statement of the main results
The Yamabe conjecture states that for any compact, smooth Riemannian manifold (M, g0) there exists a constant scalar curvature metric, conformal to g0. The first proof of this conjecture was initiated by Yamabe [Yam60] and continued by Trudinger [Tru68] Aubin [Aub76], and Schoen [Sch84]. The proof is based on the calculus of variations and elliptic partial differential equations. An alternative tool for proving the conjecture is due to Hamilton [Ham89], who introduced the normalized Yamabe flow of on a Riemannian manifold (M, g0), which is a family g  g(t), t  [0, T ] of Riemannian metrics on M such that the following evolution equation holds

tg = -(S - )g,  := Volg(M)-1 S dVolg.
M

(1.1)

Here S is the scalar curvature of g, Volg(M) the total volume of M with respect to g and  is the average scalar curvature of g. The normalization by  ensures

that the total volume does not change along the flow. Hamilton [Ham89] showed

the long time existence of the Yamabe flow. It preserves the conformal class of g0 and ideally should converge to a constant scalar curvature metric, thereby establishing the Yamabe conjecture by parabolic methods.

Establishing convergence of the normalized Yamabe flow is intricate already in the setting of smooth, compact manifolds. In case of scalar negative, scalar flat and locally conformally flat scalar positive cases, convergence is due to Ye [Ye94]. The case of a non-conformally flat g0 with positive scalar curvature is delicate and has been studied by Schwetlick-Struwe [ScSt03] and Brendle [Bre05, Bre07] amongst others.

More specifically, [ScSt03, Theorem 3.1] is a concentration-compactness dichotomy, and [ScSt03, Section 5], [Bre05, p. 270], and [Bre07, p. 544] invoke the positive mass theorem to rule out concentration (also known as the formation of bubbles), which is where the dimensional restriction in [ScSt03, Bre05] and the spin assumption in [Bre07, Theorem 4] come from. Assuming [ScYa17] to be correct, [Bre05] and [Bre07] cover all closed manifolds which are not conformally equivalent to spheres.

In the non-compact setting, our understanding is limited. On complete mani-

folds, long-time existence has been discussed in various settings by Ma [Ma16],

Ma and An [MaAn99], and the recent contribution by Schulz [Sch18]. On in-

complete surfaces, where Ricci and Yamabe flows coincide, Giesen and Topping

[GiTo10, GiTo11] constructed a flow that becomes instantaneously complete. In

higher dimensions, we have the work of Roidos [Roi20], which establishes ex-

istence of the Yamabe-flow in the presence of a cone singularity as long as the

initial scalar curvature is in Lq(M) for some q >

n 2

.

See the short discussion

in Subsection 1.3 below for the geometric interpretation. Convergence is not

discussed in [Roi20].

In this work, we study the convergence of the Yamabe flow on a general class of spaces that includes incomplete spaces with cone-edge (wedge) singularities or, more generally, stratified spaces with iterated cone-edge singularities. This continues a program initiated in [BaVe14, BaVe19], where existence and convergence of the Yamabe flow has been established in case of negative Yamabe invariant, and [LyVe20] where long time existence is studied in the case of a positive Yamabe constant. This is also an extension of the work of the first author with collaborators, [ACM14], [ACM18], and [ACT18].

We now proceed with explaining the assumptions in detail.

1.1. Normalized Yamabe flow and Yamabe constant. Consider a Riemannian manifold (M, g0), with g0 normalized such that the total volume Volg0(M) = 1. We assume M  M to be the regular part of a compact metric measure space M, meaning M carries a distance function1 d : M × M  R which coincides with the distance induced from g0 on M. We will often suppress the metric d, and leave

1This distance does not evolve in time. We will not consider the distance associated to the evolving metric.

it out of the notation. We will assume that M satisfies the [ACM14, Hypothesis i)-iv)a)]. We will state these assumptions explicitly below as Assumption 2.

The Yamabe flow (1.1) preserves the conformal class of the initial metric g0 and, assuming throughout the paper always dim M = n  3, we can write
4
g = u n-2 g0 for some function u > 0 on MT = M × [0, T ] for some upper time limit T > 0. Then the normalized Yamabe flow equation can be equivalently written as an equation for u

4(n - 1)

t u n-2 = 4 u n-2 - L0(u) , L0 := S0 - n - 2 0,

(1.2)

where L0 is the conformal Laplacian of g0, defined in terms of the scalar curvature S0 and the Laplace Beltrami operator 0 associated to the initial metric g0. The scalar curvature S of the evolving metric g can be written

and the volume form of g = u n-2 g0 is given by dVolg = u n-2 dµ, where we write

dµ := dVolg0 for the time-independent initial volume form. One computes

n tdVolg = - 2 (S - ) dVolg.

(1.4)

Hence, the total volume of (M, g) is constant, and thus equal to 1 along the flow. The average scalar curvature takes the form

The latter evolution equation in particular implies that   (t) is non-increasing along the flow. We conclude the exposition with defining some Sobolev spaces and the Yamabe constant of g0, which incidentally provides a lower bound for . We define the Lq(M) spaces with respect to the integration measure dµ.

We define the first Sobolev space H1(M) as the completion of the Lipschitz functions Lip(M) with respect to the H1-norm,

2 dµ +

||2g0 dµ,

(1.7)

where |v|2g0 := gi0j(iv)(jv). Similarly, we define H1(M, g) by using dVolg in-

stead of dµ to define L2(M, g), and ||2g

=

u-

||2g0

instead of ||2g0.

Let

u be a solution of (1.2). If u and u-1 are both bounded, one easily checks

H1(M) = H1(M, g) with equivalent norms.

How one proceeds will depend heavily on the

sign of the Yamabe constant. In this paper2 we will assume Y(M, g0) > 0. This

in particular implies directly from (1.8) that the average scalar curvature  is

positive and uniformly bounded away from zero along the normalized Yamabe

flow.

Assumption 1. The Yamabe constant Y(M, g0) is positive.

We also need the local Yamabe constant Y (M, [g0]), which is defined as fol-

lows. For any p  M, we let B(p, R) denote the open ball centred at p of radius

R. We then let

Y (M, g0) := inf lim Y(B(p, R), g0), pM R0

(1.9)

where the Yamabe constant Y(U) for open sets U  M is defined as (1.8), where all the integrals are over U and v  H1(U) with supp(u)  U  M. In Section 4, we will need the Sobolev constant S(U) for an open set U  M and the local Sobolev constant S (M) as well, so we record the definitions here.

1.2. Admissibility assumptions. This work, like [LyVe20], is strongly influenced by the work of Akutagawa, the first author, and Mazzeo, [ACM14] on the Yamabe problem on stratified spaces. We will carry over hypothesis i) - iii) and iv)a) from [ACM14, p. 5].

Definition 1.1. Let (M, g0) be a smooth Riemannian manifold of dimension n. We call (M, g0) admissible, if it satisfies the following conditions.
· M is the regular part of a compact, metric measure space M. · Smooth, compactly supported functions C c (M) are dense3 in H1(M). · The Hausdorff n-dimensional measure is absolutely continuous with respect to
dµ, and both are Ahlfors n-regular, i.e.

C-1Rn  Vol(B(p, R))  CRn

(1.11)

2See [BaVe14, BaVe19] for the case of Y(M, g0)  0. 3This can be phrased as H10(M) = H1(M). Note that this rules out M being the interior of a
manifold with a codimension 1 boundary.

for some C > 0 and every p  M and 2R < diam(M) := sup{d(p, q) : p, q  M}. · (M, g0) admits a Sobolev inequality of the following kind. There exist A0, B0 > 0 such that for all f  H1(M)

· The scalar curvature of g0 satisfies

.

(1.12)

The main examples we have in mind are closed manifolds and regular parts of smoothly stratified spaces, endowed with iterated cone-edge metrics. See [ACM14, Section 2.1] or Appendix A for a definition of the latter. That the Sobolev inequality holds in this case is shown in [ACM14, Proposition 2.2]. Note that for most of this work, we do not specify explicitly how the metric g0 looks
near the singular strata of M. Restrictions on the local behaviour of the metric will instead be coded in either Lq-data, like requiring the initial scalar curvature S0 to be in Lq(M) , or in geometric conditions like the Ahlfors n-regularity (1.11).

Remark 1.2. This work does not extend to finite volume, complete, non-compact manifolds, since (see [Heb96, Lemma 3.2, pp. 18-19], [Heb96, Remark 2), pp. 56-57]) any finite volume, complete manifold satisfying the Sobolev inequality is compact. The Sobolev inequality is our most important tool.

Assumption 2. (M, g0) is an admissible Riemannian manifold.

For the convergence results of Section 4 and 5 we also need a third assumption on M, namely a local Poincare´ inequality.

Assumption 3. M satisfies the Poincare´ inequality, that is to say there is a constant  > 0 such that for any ball B  M of radius r  diam(M), we get

 - B L2(B)  r  L2(B)

for any Lipschitz function  : B  R, where we have set

B :=

 dµ =

µ(B)

 dµ.
B

In what follows we want to relate the assumption of the Sobolev inequality (1.12) in Definition 1.1 to positivity of the Yamabe constant Y(M, g0), showing that there is some redundancy in the above assumptions. Since several of our arguments revolve around having the Sobolev inequality, we still leave it in to stress its importance.

Proposition 1.3.

Assume S0



Lq(M) for some q

>

n 2

and 0

<

Y(M, g0).

Then the

Sobolev inequality (1.12) holds.

We prove this as Proposition 3.12 below.

With the assumptions so far, we can say something about the local Yamabe constant.

Proposition 1.4. [ACM14, Prop. 1.4b)] Under Assumption 2, we have Y (M, g0) > 0.

Remark 1.5. It is important to notice that we allow points in p  M \ M in the definition of Y . Indeed, if p  M is a smooth point then

See for instance [ScYa94, Lemma A.1, p. 225]. So Y (M, g0) > 0 is always true for smooth manifolds.

1.3. Regularity of the initial scalar curvature. In this work, we show (Theorem

2.6)

that

for

we

.

We

close this subsection with the observation, that on stratified spaces, S0  Lq(M)

for q  n/2 and S0  L(M) basically carry the same geometric restriction to

leading order. Indeed, consider a cone (0, 1) × N over a Riemannian manifold

(N, g0), with metric g0 = dx2  x2gN + h, where h is smooth in x  [0, 1] and

|h|g = O(x) as x  0, where we write g := dx2  x2gN. Then

S0

dim N(dim N x2

+

O(x-1),

as x  0,

(1.13)

where the higher order term O(x-1) comes from the perturbation h. Both as-

sumptions S0  L(M) and S0  Lq(M) for q  n/2 imply that the leading term

of the metric g0 is scalar-flat, i.e. scal(gN) = dim N(dim N - 1). Of course, if

n 2

the

1.4. The main results. Theorem 2.8 and Proposition 3.6 combine to say that the Yamabe flow exists for all time in our setting. Theorem 4.9 is a dichotomy which describes what can happen to sequences u(tk) as tk  . This is our main convergence result, and says that subsequences either converge, or the volume concentrates at finally many points. The second case leads the so-called formation of bubbles. Proposition 4.17 says that given a non-trivial upper bound on the initial scalar curvature, the Yamabe flow has convergent subsequences and one gets a constant scalar curvature metric. Proposition 5.1 presents a criterion (in terms of the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian) for when the entire flow converges and not just subsequences. In Section 6, we present a detailed computation of a counter example due to Viaclovsky, which shows that the Yamabe flow does not always have convergent subsequences. In Appendix A, we give a detailed and quite general description of the bubbles which the dichotomy predicts will appear when the flow does not converge.

2. A general existence theorem for the Yamabe flow
In this section, we take a step back and show how the short-time existence and uniqueness of many kinds of flow equations follows from abstract semigroup theory. We summarize how to apply these results to the Yamabe flow towards the end of the section. Several of the results are conveniently phrased in the language of Dirichlet spaces, so we first introduce these and the relation to singular spaces. We warn the reader that there are other definitions around. In particular, it is common to call just the function space D(E) a Dirichlet space.

CONVERGENCE OF THE SINGULAR YAMABE FLOW

The definition presented here is what is called a regular, strongly local Dirichlet space in [ACM18].

Definition 2.1. We consider a Dirichlet space (M, d, µ, E) where
· (M, d) is compact with diameter D, · µ is a probability measure, · (M, d, µ, E) is regular, meaning C0(M)  D(E) is dense in C0(M) and in D(E). · (M, d, µ, E) is strongly local, which means that for any u, v  D(E) such that u
is constant on a neighbourhood of the support of v, we have E(u, v) = 0.
In that case, there is a bilinear map the energy measure  : D(E) × D(E)  M(M) such that
u, v  D(E) : E(u, v) = d (u, v).
M
Here M(M) is the dual of C0(M), which we identify (using the Riesz­Markov­Kakutani representation theorem) with the space of signed Radon measure on M) The energy measure is determined by the formula

E (u,

u)

-

1 E (,

u2)

=

 d (u, u)

2

M

for u  D(E),   D(E)  C0(M) .

Note that for u  D(E), d (u, u) is a positive Radon measure. The energy measure

satisfies the Leibniz and chain rules:

d (uv, w) = ud (v, w) + vd (u, w) for u, v, w  D(E) ,

d (f(u), v) = f (u)d (u, v) for u, v  D(E), f  Lip(R) . Then we make the following supplementary assumptions:
· We assume that d is compatible with the Caratheodory distance or intrinsic pseudo-distance dE defined by
dE (x, y) = sup u(x) - u(y) | u  D(E)  C0(M) and d (u, u)  dµ ,

where d (u, u)  dµ means that there exists a function f  1 such that d (u, u) = fdµ. · For some integer n > 2: (M, d, µ) is n-Ahlfors regular, meaning there is a constant  such that for any r  (0, D] and any x  M we have

-1



µ(B(x, r)) rn



.

· (M, d, µ, E) satisfies the Poincare´ inequalities, which is to say there is a constant

 such that for any r  (0, D] and any x  M, the following holds

v - vB

2 L2(B(x,r))

d (v, v)

B(x,r)

where

It is well known that then there is a positive constant A depending only on n, ,  such that the following Euclidean Sobolev inequality holds

GILLES CARRON, JØRGEN OLSEN LYE, AND BORIS VERTMAN

In this case, we know that Lip(M) is dense in D(E).

Remark 2.2. In the case of a dense Riemannian manifold (M, g)  M where the Riemannian distance coincides with d on M, the reader may mentally substitute E(u, v) = M u, v g dVolg, i.e. d (u, v) = u, v g dVolg. The generator L is then L = -g, where the Laplacian g is negative definite like in the rest of the article. All in all, this Dirichlet space setting covers the framework studied in the previous
section with M = M.

Remark 2.3. By [ACM15, Proposition 3.1], a compact stratified space with an iterated edge metric satisfies these conditions.

Before we state our main tool, we recall what a sectorial operator is.

Definition 2.4. Let X be a Banach space. A closed, densely defined operator A : D(A)

(A - )-1

C .

XX ||

We are going to use the following theorem, which is an adaptation of [Lun95, Theorem 8.1.1 and Corollary 8.3.8] :

Theorem 2.5. Assume that D, X are Banach spaces with D  X dense and continuously embedded, i.e.
· X  · D. Let O  D be an open set and let F : O  X be a smooth map such that for any u  O, the Frechet derivative Lu = DF(u) : D  X is sectorial, and there is a positive constant C(u) such that for any   D we have4
1 C(u)  D  Lu() X +  X  C(u)  D .
Then for any u0  O there is some  > 0 and u : [0, )  D continuous with u(0) = u0 and such that u : (0, )  D is smooth and for any t  (0, ):
u (t) = F(u(t)).
Moreover such a solution is unique.

Theorem 2.6. Assume that (M, µ, E) is a Dirichlet space5 with µ(M) = 1, and assume that it satisfies the Sobolev inequality of dimension  > 2, i.e.

 w  D(E) :

w2 2

 AE(w) + B

L -2 (M,µ)

w

2 L2(M,µ)

.

(2.1)

4This says that the graph norm of Lu is equivalent to the norm on D. 5For this theorem, we do not need the strong locality condition, i.e. that E(f, g) = M d (f, g) for some carre´ du champ  . Nor do we need the regularity condition. These conditions only
becomes important in Section 4.

f   D f H2,p(M) := D Lf Lp(M,µ) + f Lp(M,µ) .

c    C, µ - almost everywhere.

10

Then the operator L is associated with the space (M, -1µ, E). Its domain is the set of functions w  D(E) such that there is a constant C with :

  D(E ) : |E (w, )|  C  . L2(M,-1µ)

It is easy to see that D(L) = D(L). We also have that for any q  (1, ), -L : H2,q(M)  Lq is sectorial on Lq(M, -1µ) = Lq(M, µ) and H2,q(M) = {f  Lq(M, µ), Lf  Lq(M, µ)} with

We prove this right after finishing the current proof. We finally need to check the hypothesis of the Theorem 2.5. We introduce
O := {f  H2,p(M) :  c > 0, c  f µ - a.e.},
and observe that O is an open set of H2,p(M). Let F : O  Lp(M, µ) be defined by F(u) = -u(Lu + Qu). Note that u  O  Lu + Qu  Lp(M, µ) is linear and continuous, and the multiplication L × Lp  Lp is a continuous bilinear map. By (2.5), O  L(M), and on {f  L(M), :  c > 0 : c  f µ - a.e.}, the map f  f is smooth. So F is smooth on O. Moreover, if h  H2,p(M) and u  O then the linearisation reads

-DF(u)h = Lh + Vh

where  = u and V = ( + 1)uQ + u-1Lu. Lemma 2.7 insures that DF(u) : H2,p(M)  Lp(M, µ) is sectorial and that its graph norm is equivalent to the H2,p(M)-norm.

Proof of the Lemma 2.7. It is enough to show that for some large enough  :
V(L + )-1 LpLp < 1,
and this will be very similar to the proof of (2.5) Note that the Dirichlet space (M, -1µ, E) satisfies the Sobolev inequality 2.1 with constants that depend on

The result then follows because we assumed p > /2.

We end this section by applying the above general result to the Yamabe flow.

Theorem 2.8. Assume a Riemannian manifold (M, g) satisfies Assumption 1 and 2.

Then the Yamabe flow (1.2) has a unique solution u  C((0, T ), H2,p(M)), for some

T



,

with6

lim u
t0

=

u0.

Furthermore,

the

scalar

curvature

S lies

in

H2,p(M, g)

for

t  (0, T ) with lim S = S0, where t0

H2,p(M, g) := {f  Lp(M, g) : f  Lp(M, g)}

and  is the Laplacian associated to g.

Proof. We may consider the Yamabe flow without normalization (corresponding to removing  from (1.2)). From (1.2) without , we have

tu

=

u-

n-2 (n - 1)0u - 4 S0u

,

which

with

L

Q

S0,

and  = n (the dimension of M). The statement of Theorem 2.6 is then that the

Yamabe flow has a unique solution as long as u is bounded from below and

above and as long as the scalar curvature S remains bounded in Lq(M, g) for

some

q

>

n 2

.

By the evolution equation (1.2) and tu  H2,p(M), it follows that u · S 

H2,p(M) for t  (0, T ). Hence uS  L(M) for t  (0, T ). But u is bounded above

and below for t  (0, T ), so L  L(M) for t  (0, T ). For the Laplacian, we use

uS  H2,p(M) and compute

0(uS) = u0S + 2 u, S g0 + S0u  Lp(M). The Laplacian associated to g is given by



=

u-

4 n-2

0 + 2u-1 u,  g0

,

so n+2 0(uS) = u n-2 S + S0u,

6This limit is in H2,p(M), so by (2.5) this convergence is also in L(M).

3. Gain in regularity and uniform bounds for scalar curvature

We recall some evolution equations and inequalities for the scalar curvature and consequences. A proof can be found in [LyVe20, Lemma 2.1].

4
Lemma 3.1. Let g = u n-2 g0 be a family of metrics evolving according to the normalized Yamabe flow (1.2). Then S evolves according to

tS - (n - 1)S = S(S - ).

(3.1)

where  denotes the Laplacian with respect to the time-evolving metric g. We write S+ := max{S, 0} and S- := - min{S, 0}. Then S±  H1(M, g) for all time
and satisfy

tS+ - (n - 1)S+  S+(S+ - ), tS- - (n - 1)S-  -S-(S- + ).

(3.2) (3.3)

Remark 3.2. The equation (3.1) is to be understood in the weak sense: for any compactly supported smooth test function   C c (M) we have

tS ·  dVolg + (n - 1) S,  g dVolg = S(S - ) ·  dVolg.

M

By Assumption 2, C c (M) is dense in H1(M) = H1(M, g). Hence we can as well assume   H1(M, g) in the weak formulation above.

Proposition 3.3. [LyVe20, Proposition 2.3, Lemma 4.2] Let S = S(t)  H1(M, g) with

Remark 3.4. The main advantage of splitting the evolution equation into S± is that (3.3) gives us the lower bound (3.6) without having to appeal to the maximum principle, which in general fails to hold in our setting.

Remark 3.5. The condition (S0)-  L(M) is harmless. For S0  Lq(M) for some

Theorem

So by redefining the

CONVERGENCE OF THE SINGULAR YAMABE FLOW

13

In [LyVe20], the last two authors proved that the Yamabe flow exists for all time under slightly stronger assumptions on the scalar curvature than in this work. We therefore sketch a modified proof of this fact here.

Proposition 3.6. Assume a Riemannian manifold (M, g) satisfies Assumption 1 and 2. Then the maximal flow time of the Yamabe flow is T = .

Proof. By Theorem 2.8, we need to show that for any finite time T > 0, one can

find

bounds

c(T ), C(T )

>

0

and

some

q

>

n 2

such

that

c(T )



u



C(T )

and

S Lq(M,g)  C(T ). By [LyVe20, Prop. 3.1, Theorem 3.2], whose proofs still hold,

we get the upper and lower bounds on u. By redefining the starting time to be

slightly later, we may assume S0  L(M), so [LyVe20, Theorem 4.1] works to

ensure S  L(M) for any finite time T . Alternatively the arguments of [Bre05,

Lemma 2.5] go through verbatim, since they only rely on (cleverly) choosing test

functions in the evolution equations and using the Sobolev inequality (1.12), and

this gives a bound on

S

Lq(M,g)

for some q >

n 2

for any finite T .

To study convergence, we need to get time-independent bounds. In what follows, we combine results and arguments from [Str08], [Bre05], and [LyVe20] to deduce time-independent bounds on the scalar curvature S. Let us start by recording a little lemma which allows us to apply the chain rule.

Lemma 3.7. Assume v  H1(M)  L(M) and f  C1(R). Then f  v  H1(M)  L(M) and the chain rule applies;

(f  v) = f (v)v.

Proof. The composition f(v) is bounded, and thus in L2(M) (since Vol(M) < ). The function f (v) is bounded, hence f (v)v  L2(M).

Remark 3.8. This is similar to the lemma which was used in [LyVe20] and [ACM14], namely that if v  H1(M) and f  C1(R) with f  L(R), then f  v  H1(M) and
the chain rule holds.

For convergence we need to derive some bounds which do not blow up as T 

. According to Proposition 3.3, we already have such bounds on S- L(M) and

S

n
L 2 (M,g)

respectively.

We start with the simplest one.

Proposition 3.9.

Proof. We will only prove this for n  4. It is true for n = 3 as well, but the proof

requires the general machinery which we introduce when discussing Proposition

3.10.

We recall that by Remark 3.5, we may assume that S0  L(M). By the monotonicity of  (1.6) and the fact that  is bounded from below by Y(M, g0), we conclude that

We first show that we can do slightly better than a uniform n/2-norm bound on S. The arguments in the following proof are essentially due to [ScSt03, Bre05, Str08]. We write some of the details, however to demonstrate how the arguments go through in our setting. A key observation is that Lemma 3.7 along with Theorem 2.8 (which in particular says S(t)  L(M) for finite times) allow us to use the chain rule freely.

The argument for this is easier for n = 4 than the general case n  3, so we show

We now need the elementary estimate that for any p  1, we have

(xp - yp)(x - y)  |x - y|p+1

for any x, y  R0. The way to see this, is to observe that the function f(t) := (1 - tp)1/p for t  [0, 1) is concave. Using this bound with x = S + , y =  + , (and recalling that 2 > 1) we have
(S - ) (S + )2 - ( + )2  |S - |2+1.

The very last term we handle slightly differently8, and observe that we have (x - y)(xp - yp)  0 for any p > 0 and x, y > 0. Using this with x = S + ,
y =  +  to discard the very last term in (3.15), we arrive at

7Thanks to Theorem 2.8, the scalar curvature S is bounded for time 0 < t < T . The functions (S + ) is therefore in H1(M, g)  L(M) and the chain rule applies. So we do not need
approximation functions here as in [ACM14] and [LyVe20]. 8If 2 > 2 one can use the same argument, but this does not work for n = 3 or n = 4.

The proof of this differential inequality is via similar arguments to the ones used so far, using the evolution equation for S, the Ho¨ lder inequality, and the Yamabe inequality (3.13) to estimate the gradient term in (3.16)). We leave out these argument. From here, one follows the arguments from [ScSt03, pp. 69-71] to deduce lim sup F2+1(t) = 0 as well, hence the claim.

The above gain in regularity is sufficient to guarantee a uniform Sobolev inequality for H1(M, g).

so

that

inequality holds for all f  H1(M, g) independently of time, meaning one can find

Choosing small enough ensures the left hand side is non-negative (here we are using Y(M, g0) > 0) and we deduce (3.17).

4. Concentration­compactness dichotomy and bubbling

In this section we turn to the convergence of the solution u and the measure dVolg. As already noted, the average scalar curvature (t) always converges, being a monotone (see (1.6)) and bounded (by Y(M, g0)) function. We write



=

lim
t

(t).

In the classic (smooth and compact) setting there is a famous dichotomy describing what can happen to solutions of equations like (1.2) as t  . See [ScSt03,

Theorem 3.1]. We formulate the analogue as Theorem 4.9 in our setting below.

We will assume in this section and in the next one that M satisfies also Assump-

tion 3.

We start by some analytic preliminaries. The arguments given here will be valid on any Dirichlet space satisfying the requirements of Definition 2.1.

4.1. Analytic tools. To prove the dichotomy, we need a kind of Harnack inequality which we state but do not prove, referring instead to [ACM18, Section 4] (see Remark 2.2 for how to translate into the language of Dirichlet spaces).

Proposition 4.1. Let B(x, 2r)  M be an open ball of radius 2r around x  M. Let w : B(x, 2r)  R be a weak solution to the equation

-0w = Vw,

where the potential V : B(x, 2r)  R satisfies

r2p

|V|p dµ :=

In particular, if u  H1(M), u  0 solves weakly the Yamabe equation

where  is a constant, then u  H2,p(M). And if u is not identically zero, then there is a positive constant C such that

and one of the mutually exclusive statements hold:

such that for any compact K  M \ F, there is C(K) > 0 such that uk  H2,p(K) C(K) uniformly and there is  > 0 such that uk  u  Cloc(M \ F)

of conformal factors uk  H2,p(M) satisfying Volgk(M) = 1 and Sgk Lp(M)

Remark 4.11. In case i), there is more one can say about regularity of the solution u. In particular, one can give an expansion of the solution near the singular stratum, but the details of this will depend on the singularity. We refer the interested reader to [ACM14, Section 3] for such statements.

Case ii) is referred to as "concentration" or "bubbling", and we will have more to say about this in what follows, Section 6, and the appendix. Note that u could be 0 in this case.

4.3. Proof of Theorem 4.9. We start by the following convenient lemma:

The right hand side is bounded since u 2n = 1 and Proposition 3.10. We

hence   M dVolg is a uniformly bounded linear functional on C0(M). By the Banach-Alaoglu theorem again, there is a weakly convergent subsequence in

the dual space, which we identify as the signed measures.

The last statement is very similar, where one additionally uses Proposition

and

to

so for any x  M :

( is defined in Lemma 4.12)

n
({x}) < S(x) 2

(4.4)

or

({x})



S (x)

n 2

.

(4.5)

Let n F := {x  M : ({x})  S(x) 2 }.

Step 1: F is a finite set. Assume there are x  M where (4.5) holds. Then

n
2 µ({x})

=

({x})



n
S(x) 2



n

so we obtain

(4.6)

By the volume normalization, we have

1 = lim k

1 · dVolgs = µ(M) 
M

µ({x}),
xF

so by the uniform lower bound (4.6), F must be finite with a uniform bound

n
L := #F   2 Y

(4.7)

There can therefore only be finitely many points where (4.4) fails.

Step 2: Bounds near x / F. For any x / F, for any  (0, 1), there is r = rx( ) > 0

and such that

n
(B(x, 2r))  ((1 - /2)S(B(x, r))) 2 .

For s  s0 for some large s0, we therefore get

2

n

n

|Sgs| 2 dVolgs  (1 - )S(B(x, r)).

By Lemma 4.2 we get uniform bounds near x, meaning some C > 0 such that C-1  us  C on B(x, r/8).

We also note for later use that

By Ahlfors regularity (1.11), we get

({x}) = 0.

Summarizingm, we therefore conclude

({x}) < S(x) = ({x}) = 0.

Step 3: Case i). If (4.4) holds for all x  M. Then for every x  M : ({x}) = 0. Let  (0, 1) Then for every x  M, there is a r = rx( ) > 0 and such that
n
(B(x, 2r))  ((1 - /2)S(B(x, r))) 2 .

As M is compact we can cover M with finitely many balls Bi = B(xi, rxi( )/8). Using the above argumentation for each if these balls, we get uniform bounds on all of M. The convergence statements follow immediately from Theorem 4.7, and Lemma 4.6.

Step 4: Case ii). Away from the finitely many points xi  F, we are in case i) and the arguments there go through when restricting to a compact set K  M \ F.

Remark 4.14. Taking a different convergent subsequence, different things could happen

in Theorem 4.9. The upper bound (4.7) on the set F is absolute, however:

n

n

F = {x  M : ({x})  S(x) 2 }, L = #F  (/Y ) 2 .

We can extract further information out of the dichotomy and arrive at the following result

Proposition 4.15. Assume (M, g0) has an average scalar curvature satisfying

n

n

n

(0) 2  Y(M, [g0]) 2 + Y (M, [g0]) 2 ,

(4.8)

and assume u is the limit of some subsequence uk. Then either a) We are in case i) of Theorem 4.9. b) or we are in case ii) of Theorem 4.9 with u = 0, L = 1 and   Y .

Remark 4.16. We recall that for a smooth manifold M, we have Y = Y(Sn, ground), so the above proposition reduces to parts of [ScSt03, Theorem 1.2] in the smooth setting.

26

GILLES CARRON, JØRGEN OLSEN LYE, AND BORIS VERTMAN

Proof. The monotonicity (1.6) of (t) says   (0), and equality happens if and only if S0 is already a constant scalar curvature metric. So we may assume  < (0) in (4.8).

By the discussion of µ in the proof of Theorem 4.9, we can write

2n

Note that the volume normalization gives

and that for each x  F :

(4.10)

What happens next splits into two cases. Either u = 0 everywhere or not. Assume first that u = 0. By (4.9) and (4.10), we get

Combining this with (4.8), we deduce

n

n

n

n

LY 2  2 < (0) 2  Y(M, [g0]) 2 + Y 2  2Y 2 ,

meaning L < 2. The option L = 0 is impossible due to (4.9), so we conclude L = 1.

Assume next that u = 0 (meaning it is not identically the 0-function). By definition of the Yamabe constant10 (1.8),

(4.11)

4.4. Small initial energy yields convergence of the solution. We end this section with a small energy criterion ((4.12) below) which will ensure that the flow lands in case i) of Theorem 4.9.

5. Eigenvalue criterion for prevention of concentration

Theorem 4.9 leaves open two questions. Can we ensure L = 0? And does the flow itself converge, and not just subsequences? In this section, we give a partial answer to the second question and an additional answer to the first question. In the smooth setting, Matthiesen [Mat16, Theorem 1.2] has come up with a criterion to avoid bubbling, and this involves imposing a bound on the first eigenvalue of , the time-varying Laplace operator. We show here that such a bound would work in our non-smooth setting as well, but we lack a criterion on the initial data to ensure this bound is satisfied.

We write  = limt  as in Section 4. We start by a criterion for ruling out the existence of several convergent subsequences with different limits. Assume tk   is some subsequence for which u(tk)  u.

Proposition

5.1.

Assume

 n-1

is

not

an

eigenvalue

of

the

Laplace

operator

of

g

:=

4

u n-2 

g0.

Then

u(t)

converges

weakly

to

u.

Proof. We start by recalling a classical fact in dynamical systems, namely that the set of possible limits u of subsequences utk is a closed and connected set. The reason being that the set of possible limits can be described as

L :=

{ut

,

t



T}

weak

H1
,

T>0

i.e. an intersection of compact connected sets. It therefore suffices to show that
{u} is a closed and open set in L . We know that if u  L then for any p > n/2, u  H2,p(M) and w = u/u solves the Yamabe equation

n-1

n+2

-4 n

-

2 w

+

w

=

w n-2

.

The linearisation of the Yamabe equation at u is

-v

=

 v. n-1

28

GILLES CARRON, JØRGEN OLSEN LYE, AND BORIS VERTMAN

By assumption, this linear equation has no non-trivial solution, so by the inverse function theorem, u is an isolated point11 in the set of solutions of the Yamabe equation hence {u} is a closed and open set in L and L reduces to {u}.
The above result combines with Theorem 4.9 to say that if there is no concentration and Proposition 5.1 holds, then the entire flow converges strongly in H2,p(M) (without passing to subsequences).
We now come to the eigenvalue criterion following Matthiesen [Mat16].

Proposition 5.2 ([Mat16]). Assume that there is a constant  > 0 such that for any t  0 the first non-zero eigenvalue of gt is bounded from below by . Let uk = u(tk)  u be a convergent subsequence. Then either
· u is bounded from above and below (away from 0) and there is no concentration. · u = 0 and there is only one concentration point.
Remark 5.3. The proposition does not rule out that for different subsequence, different scenario occur.

Remark 5.4. The conclusion is exactly the same as in Proposition 4.15. In that proposition, we impose an initial average scalar curvature bound, whereas Proposition 5.2 requires a lower bound on the first eigenvalue along the flow.

Proof. Let assume that there is at least one subsequence with a concentration point x. Let 0 < r < 1. We first show that

We estimate this integral using the Cavalieri principle and Ahlfors regularity. Write (z) = d(x, z). For any measurable A  X, and f  C0((0, )), we have


f  (z) dµ(z) = f(t)dV(t),

where dV(t) is the Stieltjes measure associated to the function V(t) = µ(A  B(x, t)). Since in our case f(t) = t-n  C1((0, )) and tends to 0 as t  , we

may integrate by parts and write





f(t)dV(t) = - V(t)f (t) dt + lim f(b)V(b) - lim f(a)V(a).

The two boundary terms drop out since V(a) = 0 for all a < r2 and f(b)V(b) = V(r)f(b) -b-- 0 for b > r, hence

With a stronger assumptions, we can rule out concentration and ensure convergence. This is a consequence of [ScSt03, Proof of Proposition 2.14].

the

and we get convergence to a positive function u.

and

G2(t) :=

The assumed eigenvalue bound gives us

-G2(t)  -F2(t) = -

 +  n-1 n-1

F2(t),

for some fixed  > 0. Writing (t) =  + ~ (t) where ~ (t)  0 and absorbing this ~ in the definition of , we get

d

dt F2(t)  n - 2 (- + (t)) F2(t).

For all t large enough, we have

(t)

,

so

with

µ

:=

4 n-2

we

get

d dt F2(t)  -µF2(t),

hence F2(t) is converging exponentially fast to 0. Then the argument of [ScSt03, Proof of theorem 1.2] implies that there is non concentration and by Proposition 5.1, we get convergence.

5.1. The role of the positive mass theorem. As announced at the start of the section, we do not have conditions on (M, g0) which ensure the eigenvalue bounds in this section are satisfied. In the smooth case, this is where the positive mass theorem enters. Indeed, [ScSt03, Equation 57] is essentially an eigenvalue bound, and the validity of this uses the local version of the positive mass theorem [ScSt03, Equation 61]. We cannot imitate these arguments, since we lack conformal normal coordinates at all points in M and an expansion of the Green's function akin to [ScSt03, Equation 61].

6. A non-convergent example - the Eguchi-Hanson space

If (M4, g0) is an ALE (asymptotically locally Euclidean) gravitational instanton, the conformal compactification of (M4, g0) is a smooth orbifold (M, g) with one singular point  modelled on C2/ where  is a finite subgroup of SU(2). Vi-

aclovsky [Via10] has shown that there is no Lipschitz conformal deformation of (M, g) of constant scalar curvature. In this case Y(M, g) = Y(S4, ground)/ # .

Hence in this case, we know by the dichotomy of Theorem 4.9 that any Yam-

on

(M, g)

converges

to

in

H1(M)

and

develops

a

spherical bubble at the singular point  as t  . We will study the simplest

of these in great detail, namely (a conformal compactification of) the Eguchi

Hanson space, with  = µ2 := {±1}.

We take as smooth manifold M = T CP1, the cotangent bundle of CP1, and think of this as the blow-up (in the algebraic-geometric sense) of C2/{±1}, where the action by -1 is z  -z. Removing the zero section CP1 we get a manifold biholomorphic to C2 \ {0} /{±1}, and we will perform most of our analysis on the double cover C2 \ {0}. We equip M with the Eguchi-Hanson metric, which
is a Ricci-flat Ka¨hler metric introduced in [EgHa79, Equation 2.33a]. In complex coordinates (z1, z2)  C2 \ {0}, the metric (thought of as a 2 × 2 hermitian matrix)

1 - a4 + r4 r2 ,

(6.1)

where r is the Euclidean distance to the origin and a is a fixed real number. The significance of a is that

(gEH)|CP1 = a2gFS,

(6.2)

where gFS denotes the Fubini-Study metric on CP1, and the way to see this is as follow. Introducing the notation z·dz := z1dz1+z2dz2 and |dz|2 := dz1dz1+dz2dz2,
the Eguchi-Hanson line element reads

ds2EH =

a4 + r4

|dz|2 |z · dz|2 r2 - r4

|z · dz|2

+

.

a4 + r4

The term in the brackets we recognize as the Fubini-Study metric on CP1 written in homogeneous coordinates. The last term goes to 0 as r  0 , and this establishes (6.2). One readily checks that det(gEH) = 1, which implies Ricci-flatness.

As singular manifold M, we take the one-point compactification of T CP1. We
remark that this compactified space can be identified as the weighted projective space CP21,1,2 where we use the notation of [Via13], but we will not need this explicit identification. We now conformally change the Eguchi-Hanson metric by a conformal factor 2 where  has the properties that |CP1 = 1 and   O(r-2) as r  . This is a conformal compactification (M, 2g) with a singular (an
orbifold singularity) point at infinity.

We can arrange for g := 2g to satisfy
· (M, g) is compact. · scalar curvature S of g satisfies S  L(M), S > 0 on M.
and we will demonstrate this below by a particular choice of .

Observe that the metric g is U(2)-symmetric, so the family of metrics evolving according to Yamabe-flow will (by uniqueness of solutions) be U(2)-symmetric as well. This forces the conformal factor u to be rotationally symmetric at all time, and we may write u(t, x) = v(t, r) for some v : [0, ) × (0, )  (0, ) for the conformal factor restricted to T CP1 \ CP1.
For a Ka¨hler metric h, the Laplacian is given by (see [Bal06, equation 7.27])  = 4hµµ = 4tr(h-12), where we think of h as a hermitian matrix.14 The inverse metric of the Eguchi-Hanson metric (6.1) can be written15

The scalar curvature of g reads (using the expressions given in (1.2) for the

conformal Laplacian).

S = -6-3EH,

(6.5)

so the condition S > 0 is equivalent to -EH > 0.

Notice that the volume element of g reads dVolg = 4dµ where dµ = dVolEuc since det(gEH) = 1. We also record that [Via10] has computed the Yamabe constant in this case, and the result is Y(M, [gEH]) = Y(S4)/ 2 = 8 3, and this equals the local Yamabe constant, Y (M, gEH) = Y(M, [gEH]). We stress that this is independent of the choice of conformal compactification .

We now make a particular choice, namely

(r)2

=

a4 a4 +

r4 .

This choice satisfies lim r2 = a2 < , so this is an allowed conformal factor. r
Using this, one easily checks17

and we note that S L2(M,g) = 12 2 > 8 3 = Y (M, [gEH]), so the small-

bounds on the solution u (as already predicted by Viaclovsky's result). The

due to Remark 1.5, that

holds for any smooth point p. This means the bubble has to form at the point at infinity. We will have a closer look at this next.
We can write down the Yamabe flow explicitly in this case. Let us first compute , the Laplacian associated to 2g. This is no longer a Ka¨hler metric, so the above formula no longer applies. We therefore use the more general formula

f =

1 det(g) k

det(g)lf

= -2EHf + 2-3 , f gEH ,

where we have inserted det(g) = 8. When f = f(r2), one easily uses (6.3) to

We will derive some uniform bound on v(t, x) for x > 0. We observe that the right hand side of (6.7) is -S · v3. Since the initial scalar curvature (6.6) is non-negative, Proposition 3.3 tells us that S  0 for all time. Hence
x 1 - x2 x (xv)  0.

Integrating this from x to 1 yields

-(1 - x2)x(xv)  0,

or x(xv)  0 and thus

v(t, 1)  xv(t, x)

CONVERGENCE OF THE SINGULAR YAMABE FLOW

holds for all time. The left hand side we bound as follows. From Proposition 3.3, we have

This gives a uniform bound

for all time. This shows that the solution can only blow up at x = 0.

One can of course try to numerically solve (6.7) directly. Figure 1 shows the short-time evolution, and is gotten by solving the equation with an explicit time scheme. One sees the mass starting to accumulate near x = 0.

Remark 6.1. The global version of the positive mass theorem, saying that the mass is positive for all asymptotically Euclidean spaces other than Rn, famously fails if one relaxes the assumptions to allow locally asymptotically Euclidean spaces. The EguchiHanson space is the easiest counter example. In light of the role the positive mass theorem plays in the smooth Yamabe problem, it is curious that the compactification of EguchiHanson space is an example of a singular space where the Yamabe problem does not have a solution. We suspect there is a connection here, but we leave the precise formulation of it as future work.

Remark 6.2. In [ACM14], the Yamabe problem was shown to always have a solution under the assumption Y(M, g0) < Y (M, g0). This condition fails for the above example, where instead Y(M, gEH) = Y (M, gEH). We do not know if this assumption alone is enough to guarantee that the Yamabe flow converges. If not, it would mean that we have spaces where the Yamabe problem has solutions which are not found by the Yamabe flow.

Appendix A. Description of the bubbles

We describe here the bubbles decomposition of Palais-Smale sequences18 on smoothly stratified Riemannian pseudomanifolds. We will generalize the description of Struwe [Str84]. In our situation, it will give more informations on the blow-up behaviour along the Yamabe flow on this space. We believe that this decomposition could be useful for other types of non-linear equation on smoothly stratified Riemannian pseudomanifold.
In this appendix, the singular stratum M \ M plays a bigger role, and we need to describe the metric g0 in more detail. To conform with standard notation, we therefore change notation. The link to the main text is M = X, and M = Xreg = X \ Xn-2.

Some words on the geometry of such a space. For more detailed information see [ACM14, Subsection 2.1] or [Alb12, Section 3]. Let X be a compact stratified space of dimension n with empty boundary, which means X admits a stratification
X0  X1 · · ·  Xn-2  X,
and for each k, Xk \ Xk-1 is a smooth manifold of dimension k. We endow X with an iterated edge metric. That is Xreg = X \ Xn-2 is endowed with a smooth Riemannian metric g0 that has the following behaviour nearby the singular strata. Let p  Xk \ Xk-1, there is Z is a compact stratified space of dimension n - k - 1 and a homeomorphism

where for each (y, r)  Bk × [0, ), the bilinear form k,(r, y, z)dzdz extended to an iterated edge metric on Z with smooth dependence on (y, r).
We endow X with a distance d such that (X, d) is the metric completion of (Xreg, distg0) and a Radon measure µ induced by the Riemannian volume element dµ := dVolg0 for which Xreg has full measure.

Tangent spaces and fake tangent spaces. In order to analyse the blow-up behaviour of approximate solution of Yamabe type equations, we need to understand blow-up limits of our space
Definition A.1. A pointed metric space (X, d, x) is a fake tangent space at x  X if it is the pointed Gromov-Hausdorff limit of a sequence (X, -i 1d, xi) where limi i = 0 and limi xi = x.
It means that we can find a sequence i  0 and maps hi : B(x, -i 1)  X  B(xi, i-i 1) such that
· hi(x) = xi, · for each p  B(xi, i-i 1) there is some q  B(x, -i 1) such that
d(hi(q), p)  i i
· p0, p1  B(x, -i 1) : d(p0, p1) - -i 1d(hi(p0), hi(p1) ) < i. We can then assume that there is also a map fi : B(xi, i-i 1)  B(x, -i 1) that satisfies p  B(xi, i-i 1) : d(hi(fi(p)), p)  i i and q  B(x, -i 1) : d(fi(hi(q)), q)  i. Up to extraction of subsequence, one of the following cases occurs

First case. If x  Xreg then the only fake tangent space at x is the Euclidean space.

Second case. x  Xk \ Xk-1 and limi d(x,xi) =  < . Using the homeoi
morphism h, (A.1)), and for any  > 0, and for i large enough, we define h~ i(, s, z) = h( i, is, z) on Bk() × C[0,)(Z). Up to extraction of subsequence,
we can assume that limi h~ -i 1(xi) = (0, , z), so the fake tangent space is the tangent space at x, meaning it is Rk × C[0,+)(Z) endowed with the metric
gERukc + dr2 + r2k(0, 0) but pointed at (0, r, z).

If one performs a further rescaling by ri of zi  Z one sees that the fake tangent i
space is a product Rk+1 × Z where Z is a fake tangent space of (Z, k(0, 0)) at z

where z = limi zi.

We summarize our findings as follows.

Proposition A.2. Assume X is a compact stratified space equipped with an iterated edge metric. Then fake tangent spaces at x  X are iterated tangent spaces at x. More precisely, a tangent space at x  Xk \ Xk-1 is of the form
X = Rk+ × C[0,)(),
where  is a compact stratified space of dimension n - k - - 1 endowed with an iterated edge metric and the base point can be any point of X.

Convergence of functions. We also need some notions of convergence of function along a sequence of metric spaces that converges in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. A standard reference is the paper of Kuwae and Shioya [KaKu03].
We consider a fake tangent space at x, (X, d, x). We know that X = Rk+ × C[0,)() = C[0,)(S) is a smoothly stratified Riemannian pseudomanifold that is the cone over the stratified space whose regular part is (0, /2) × Sk+ -1 × Z endowed with the Riemannian metric
d2 + cos2()gSk+ -1 + sin2()kZ.
It is the pointed Gromov-Hausdorff limit of the rescaled spaces (X, -i 1d, xi) and for each  > 0 and for sufficient large i, we have a map Hi : B(xi,  i)  C[0,)(S) which satisfies
· Hi(xi) = x,

CONVERGENCE OF THE SINGULAR YAMABE FLOW

39

· for each p  C[0,)(S) there is some q  B(xi,  i) such that

d(Hi(q), p)  i · p0, p1  B(xi,  i) : d(Hi(p0), Hi(p1)) - -i 1d(p0, p1) ) < i.

Convergence of points. We say that a sequence yi  X converges to y  X if Hi(yi) converges to y.

Uniform convergence. A sequence of function fi : X  R is said to converge uniformly on compact set to f : X  R if for each 

lim i

fi - f  Hi

L(B(xi, i)) = 0

Convergence of the measure. The geometry of (X, d) comes from an iterated edge metric g and has an associated measure µ. We have in fact the pointed measure Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of (X, -i 1d, -i nµ, xi) to (X, d, µ).

Convergence in Lp. A sequence fi  Lp(X) is said to converge weakly to f  Lp(X) if
· For any i  C0(X) with bounded support (meaning there is  > 0 such that for all i we have supp(i)  B(xi,  i)) that converge uniformly to   C0(X) (hence supp()  B(x, )) we have

Convergence in H1. A sequence fi  H1(X) is said to converge weakly to f  H1(X)

if

2n
· fi converges weakly to f  L n-2 (X),

· supi X |fi|2g0 i2-ndµ < .

Notice that our definition is slightly different the the usual one in order to take

into account that the L2 norm of f and of f do not rescaled in the same way,

2n
but the L n-2

norm of f and the L2-norm of f do.

Such a sequence is said to

in

if

it

For any u  H1(X), there is a sequence ui  H1(X) that converges strongly in H1

to u.

We can similarly define the weak and strong convergence in H1loc(X). More-

over a bounded sequence in H1 (i.e.

satisfying supi

|f | X

 and

supi X |fi|2 2i-ndµ < ) always has a weakly convergent subsequence H1.

Moreover, weak limit in H1 converge strongly in L2loc.

Mosco convergence. The sequence of quadratic forms Ei(u) = X |u|2g0 2i-ndµ converges in the Mosco sense to E(u) = X |u|2g0dµ. We will not give the definition here, but it implies for instance the convergence of the corresponding heat

kernel.

The results. Assume that R  L(X) and  > 0. Let cn = 4(n - 1)/(n - 2) , and for u  H1(X) we set:

Remark A.3. This is the form the Yamabe energy takes, with R = S0. The additional term then serves as a Lagrange multiplier, ensuring the volume is normalized.

Definition A.4. A bounded sequence (u) in H1 is said to be a Palais-Smale sequence for I if the sequence (I(u)) converges and if
DI(u)  0 in H1  .

The definition in particular says that there is a sequence of real numbers () converging to zero such that

· the sequence of rescaled spaces (X, -1d, x) converges in the Gromov-Hausdorff

topology to (X, d, x) a fake tangent space at x

· (X, d) is conical at x.

We called x the center of the bubble and  will be called the scale of the bubble.

We will choose the following norm on H1(X, g0):

By the Sobolev inequality (1.12) this norm is equivalent to the traditional Hilbert

norm, it has the advantage that it behaves nicely under rescaling

n-2
 = H1(X,g0)  2  . H1(X, -2g0)
This will be very convenient when we try to understand the blow-up behaviour of Palais-Smale sequences.
We have the following observation:

Proposition A.6. Assume that (B) is a bubble with center x and scale  such that

n-2

converges

to

(X, d, x).

Then for v =

Proof. By definition,

Hence (B) converges strongly to v in H1-norm.

Our main result in this appendix is the following.

Theorem A.7. Assume that the Ricci curvature of g is bounded, meaning there is a  such that
x  Xreg : Ricci g0  
and that the cone angles of the tangent spaces along Xn-2 \ Xn-3 are always less than 2. Let (u) be a Palais-Smale sequence for I of non-negative functions. Then, up to extracting a subsequence, there is a non-negative function u  H1(X) solving the equation

(A.4)

We prove the theorem below. The assumptions on the Ricci curvature are made in order to apply the rigidity result of Mondello [Mon18] which yield the following.

Theorem A.8. Under this assumptions of Theorem A.7, if X is a fake tangent space of X at x and if v  H1(X) is a non-negative function solving the equation

n+2
-cnv = v n-2 ,

then we can find x  X such that X is conical at x and a  > 0 such that

Proof. The hypotheses imply that (X, g) is Ricci flat on its regular part and that

it has no cone angles greater than 2. Moreover we know that X = C[0,+)(S) is a metric cone over some smoothly stratified Riemannian pseudomanifold (S, gS) which is Einstein on its regular part with scalar curvature equal to (n - 1)(n - 2).

Hence we can conformally compactify (X, g) and obtain X whose regular part is

(0, ) × Sreg endowed with the metric g^ = d2 + sin2()gS which is Einstein with scalar curvature n(n - 1) and has also no cone angles greater than 2. So that

the metric

4

4

v n-2 g = f n-2 g^

has constant scalar curvature. I. Mondello has proven (see [Mon18, Theorem 4.1]) that there is another smoothly stratified Riemannian pseudomanifold (, g) which is Einstein on its regular part with scalar curvature equal
4
to (n - 1)(n - 2) so that X, v n-2 g is isometric to the spherical suspension over

,

4

n(n - 1)

v n-2 g =



d2 + sin2()g

.

So

4

n(n - 1) 1

v n-2 g =

 (1 + r2)2

dr2 + r2g

(A.5)

The metric dr2 + r2g is then conformal to g and has zero scalar curvature, that

is to say

dr2

r2g

=

4
h n-2 g

where h is harmonic and non negative. Furthermore, (X, gX) satisfies the elliptic

Harnack inequalities (as in Proposition 4.1), hence any non negative harmonic

function

is

constant.

So

With this result in hand we can adapt the classical proof. We will follow the nice exposition given by E. Hebey in [Heb14, section 3] which we find very suitable for generalization to a singular setting. There are several steps whose proof are identical to the one in the case of smooth manifolds, and we will refer to the corresponding statements in that monograph.
Proof of Theorem A.7.
Proof. The proof is long, and will be split into several parts with lemmas.

Step 1 ­ From weak to strong H1 convergence.

Lemma A.9 ([Heb14, Lemma 3.3]). Assume that (u) is a Palais-Smale sequence for

I which converges weakly to u in H1(X), then v := u - u defines a Palais-Smale

Moreover the sequence of measures |u| n-2 dµ-|v| n-2 dµ converges weakly to |u| n-2 dµ.

strong convergence in H1(X) is measured by the concentration of the measure

Then lim

H1(B(x,/2) = 0.

The proof is identical to the first step in the proof of [Heb14, Theorem 3.2]. The following is a generalization of this result under a rescaling.

Lemma A.11. Assume that (u) is a Palais-Smale sequence for I. Assume that (X, d, x)

is a fake tangent space at x i.e. for some sequence of points (x) and some sequence of

positive real numbers(

), the rescaled spaces (X,

-1 

d,

x)

converges

for

the

Gromov-

n-2

Hausdorff topology to (X, d, x). Assume that along this sequence

2


u

converges

weakly to u  H1(X) and that for any  > 0, we can find 0 such that for any   0

Proof of Lemma A.11. Let   H1(X) be arbitrary. By assumption, we can find sequences () and (w) in H1(X) such that when

B(x,r)

Then one of two scenarios hold. Alternative 1: inf  > 0 and by the proof of Lemma A.11 implies that H1-weak sublimits of the sequence (u) are actually H1- strong sublimits. Alternative 2. Up to extraction of a subsequence, we have

· (X, d, x) is a fake tangent space at x  X, that is is the pointed Gromov-

Note that u  0. By construction we can apply Lemma A.11 and get that

u

converges strongly in H1loc. In particular

u n-2 dµ = S (X)/2.

Hence u is not zero and we are in position to apply the Theorem A.8 and get

that for some x  X:

u(x) =

2 + d(x, x)2

with c = n(n - 1)/. Hence we can find a bubble (B) with center x and scale

 such that x  x, and along the convergence toward the fake tangent space

B) converges strongly to u.

The proof Lemma A.11 shows that (u - B)

is a Palais-Smale sequence for I . We let20 v = (u - B)+ and we get

u = v + B - r

where r = (u - B)- . For each  > 0 we have

GILLES CARRON, JØRGEN OLSEN LYE, AND BORIS VERTMAN

The strong convergence in H1loc implies that for fixed  > 0,

2n

lim


B(x, ) |B - u| n-2 dµ = 0. Hence

The same computation leads to the fact that (r) converges strongly to 0 in H1. Hence

lim


u - v - B

H1 = 0.

The last assertion also follows from the same computation.

Step 4 ­ Profile decomposition. We discuss now of the mass of a bubble that is to say of

2n

lim

B n-2 

dµ.

 X

We have already said that this is equal to the corresponding quantity of the

associated fake tangent space, that is if (x) are the centres of the bubble and 

are the scaled then (X, -1d, x)  converges in the pointed Gromov-Hausdorff

n-2

topology to (X, d, x) and along this convergences of spaces

B

converges

strongly in H1 to u, which is a solution of the equation

-cnu = u n-2 .

Hence

Where

and

X(x)

=

µ(B(x,r)) n rn

(recall

that (X, x) is conical at x). But according to [Mon18, Proposition 4.2], u realizes

the Yamabe invariant of X, hence

2

 u n-2 dµ = Y(X)  Y (X) = S (X).

So that the mass of a bubble is always larger or equal to

n(n-1) 

2 Y (X). Hence if

one applies Lemma (A.12) several times, we can not extract more that L bubbles

where21

So that we get the existence of a finite number of bubbles and u so that we get the strong H1-convergence (A.3).

21Compare with (4.7).

Step 5 ­ On the localisation of the bubbles. We need now to explain why the bub-

ble are separated that is we explain why (A.4) is true. If it not true then

up to extraction of a subsequence and change of the labelling of the bubbles

one can assume that for each j > i:

lim


+ (j)
(i)

+ (i)

d(x(j),x(i))2

(j)

(i) (j)

=  and

that (X, (i)-1d, x(i))  converges in the pointed Gromov-Hausdorff topol-

ogy to (X, d, x(i)) and such that along this convergence for j  i we have

lim


x(j)

=

and

for

each

lim


(j) (i)

We

will

have

u

and u moreover each of the u(j) will solve the equation

since
