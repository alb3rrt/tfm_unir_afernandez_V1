## Abstract

Experiments on eight real-world software systems/environments with diverse performance attributes reveal that our MMO model is statistically more effective than state-of-the-art single-objective counterparts in overcoming local optima (up to 42% gain), while using as low as 24% of their measurements to achieve the same (or better) performance result.
