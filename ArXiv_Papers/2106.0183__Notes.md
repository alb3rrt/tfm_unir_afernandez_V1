## Abstract

In this paper, the Joule-Thomson Expansion of Born-Infeld AdS black holes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is studied in the extended phase space. The inversion curves and the isenthalpic curves are discussed in detail. We analyze the effect of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ on the inversion curves and plot the inversion and isenthalpic curves in the $T-P$ plane, which can determine the cooling-heating regions.
