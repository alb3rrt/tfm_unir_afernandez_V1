A NONLOCAL FORMULATION FOR THE PROBLEM OF MICROWAVE HEATING OF MATERIAL WITH TEMPERATURE
DEPENDENT CONDUCTIVITY
GIOVANNI CIMATTI
Abstract. Microwave electromagnetic heating are widely used in many industrial processes. The mathematics involved is based on the Maxwell's equations coupled with the heat equation. The thermal conductivity is strongly dependent on the temperature, itself an unknown of the system of P.D.E. We propose here a model which simplifies this coupling using a nonlocal term as the source of heating. We prove that the corresponding mathematical initial-boundary value problem has solutions using the Schauder's fixed point theorem.

1. Introduction

Microwave electromagnetic heating is increasingly used in industrial applications. The existing treatments deals mainly with one-dimensional models (see [7], [9], [10] and reference therein). In this paper the coupling between the Maxwell's equations and the heat equation is modeled in a simplified form, since the source term in the heat equation is taken to be

E(t)

=

1 2



1 D2(t) + 1 B2(t) dx



µ

which represents the total electromagnetic energy This is justified by the order

of magnitude of the parameters involved, moreover this approach simplifies the

mathematical treatment and is probably also useful for the numerical treatment.

Let  be an open and bounded subset of R3 (or of R2) representing a conductor

of both heat and electricity. The boundary of , denoted , is supposed to be of

class C2. The electrical conductivity  depends from the temperature  and the

position, according to a given law:  = (, x). We wish to determine the electric

induction D(x, t), the magnetic induction B(x, t) and the temperature (x, t) in 

with the following initial boundary-value problem

where D0(x), B0(x) and 0(x) are given initial data. The dielectric constant , the magnetic permeability µ and the diffusivity  are all assumed to be constants. n is the unit vector normal to . The term in the R.H.S of equation (1.1) reflects a possible generation of charge in  as e.g. for the presence of radio-active material in . 1
In this paper we prove that, under suitable assumptions on the data, the problem (1.1)-(1.8) has solutions. The main analytical tool will be the Schauder's theorem used to make a fixed point on the total electromagnetic energy E(t).

2. Weak formulation of the problem
In addition to the usual Lebesgues and Sobolev spaces use will be made of the following spaces (see for more details [4], [5]) and [3])

(2.1)

H(curl; ) =   L2()3, curl   L2()3

(2.2)

H0(curl; ) =   L2()3, curl   L2()3, n  | = 0 .

We recall that the mapping v  (n  v) from C1(¯ )3 into C1()3 can be extended by continuity to a mapping, again denoted v  (nv), from H(curl; ) into H-1/2() 3 . We recall the Green formula 2

(2.3)

curl A, B - A, curl B = n  A · Bd 



for all A and B  H(curl, ). If, in particular, either A or B  H0(curl; ) then

(2.4)

curl A, B = A, curl B .

We motivate here our weak formulation of problem (1.1)-(1.8) . Let T > 0 and (D, B, ) be a classical solution. Let

1This model apply to micro-wave heating not to be confused with induction heating which is

based on the quasi-stationary Maxwell equations. 2Here and hereafter (A, B) denotes the scalar product in L2()3 and

the corresponding

norm. Moreover, we use the notation  A(x, t) · B(x, t)dx = (A(t) · B(t)).

3. The linear problem
To prove that problem (2.6)-(2.16) has at least one solution we study in this Section a linear problem for the Maxwell' equations in which the electrical conductivity s is assigned as a function of x and t.
Theorem 3.1. Let

(3.1)

(3.2)

D0(x)  H0(curl; ), B0(x)  H(curl; ).

Proof. 3 4 We apply the Galerkin method. Let j(x)  C1(¯ )3, j  N be such that

(3.11)

j  n = 0 on  for all j

(3.12)

{1, ...., m} are linearly independent for every m.

3The semigroup theory, as e.g. in [1], is not directly applicable since, in the present case, the
Maxwell operator depends explicitly on t. 4The proof of this theorem is modeled after theorems 4.1 and 5.1 of [4]. However, these
theorems are no directly applicable to the present case since here s depends on t.

By the theorem of existence and uniqueness for systems of ordinary differential equations the linear initial value problem (3.18)- (3.20) has one and only one solution (dj(t), bj(t)) defined in [0, T ].
Let us multiply (3.18) by dj(t) and (3.19) by bj(t) and sum over j from 1 to m. We find respectively

where the constant C depends only on the data. Using the Gronwall's lemma we conclude that

(3.26)

Dm and Bm are bounded in L(0, T ; L2()3) by a constant M,

with M not depending on m. Therefore, we can extract two subsequences Dµ and Bµ such that

(3.27)

Dµ  D, Bµ  B weakly* in L(0, T ; L2()3).

Let j(t)  C1([0, T ]), j(T ) = 0, j(t)  C1([0, T ]), j(T ) = 0 and define

Let us choose in (3.18) and (3.19) m = µ. Multiply (3.18) by j(t) and (3.19 by j(t). Summing over j from 1 to m, integrating by parts and using (2.4) we obtain

Furthermore, if  satisfies (2.7), we can find a sequence Wk(x, t) of the form (3.29) such that

(3.54)

Thus we are permitted to write

D  L(0, T ; L2()3). t

(3.55)

Thus (3.5) and (3.6) are satisfied in the sense of distribution.

With the degree of regularity on the solution now at our disposal we can also prove easily that the solution is unique. For, we have

Theorem 3.2. If we assume in Theorem 3.1

(3.58)

the corresponding solution vanishes identically, i.e. the solution of the problem (3.1)-(3.10) is unique.

Remark 3.3. If s(x, t) represents an electrical conductivity the physically correct assumption would be s(x, t) > 0 (see [6] page 129). However, mathematically this assumption is not needed, in fact the conditions (3.3) and (3.4) are all what is needed.

Use will be made in this section of the following "a priori" estimate for the heat equation (see [2]). If f (t)  L(0, T ) and 0(x)  H01() the weak solution of the following initial-boundary value problem

Estimating the R.H.S of (4.14) with the help of (4.5), taking into account of the

initial conditions (4.8) and using the Gronwall' s lemma, we conclude that there

exits a constant N , depending only on the data, such that

We apply Theorem 3.1 with s^(x, t) = (^(x, t), x). The condition (3.3) is certainly

verified by (4.5). Moreover, by (4.2) and (3.4) we have

E^(t) = 1 1 D^ (t), curl B^ (t) - B^ (t), curl D^ (t) - 1 (^(x, t), x)D^ (t)·D^ (t)dx+ 1 D^ (t), G(t) .

The first integral in R.H.S vanishes by (2.4). Thus

(4.29)

E^(t) = - 1 (^(x, t), x)D^ (t) · D^ (t)dx + 1 D^ (t), G(t) .





Using (4.5) and (3.26) we can estimate the R.H.S. of (4.29) and obtain

(4.30)

E^(t) L(0,T )  C,

where the constant C depends only on the data. Thus (4.27) holds true and E^(t)  K. Since H1,(0, T ) is compactly imbedded in C0([0, T ]) we concluded that T is a
compact operator. To apply the Schauder's fixed point theorem it remains to prove
that T is continuous.

A NONLOCAL FORMULATION FOR THE PROBLEM OF MICROWAVE HEATING 13

Assume cj(t)  K and

(4.31)

cj(t)  c¯(t) in C0([0, T ]).

Let us define

(4.32)

j(t) = T (cj(t)), ¯(t) = T (c¯(t)).

We claim that j(t)  ¯(t). Let ¯ and j be respectively the solutions of the problems

(4.33)

¯ = ¯ + c¯(t), t

¯(x, 0) = 0(x),

¯ = 0 on  × (0, T )

(4.34)

j t

= j

+ cj(t),

j(x, 0) = 0(x),

j = 0 on  × (0, T ).

By difference from (4.33) and (4.34), recalling (4.2) we have

(4.35)

j - ¯ H1,(0,T ;H01())  C cj(t) - c¯(t) L(0,T ).

Set j = (j , x) and ¯ = (¯, x). By (4.5) we obtain

(4.36)

j - ¯  1 j - ¯ H1,(0,T ;H01())  1C cj (t) - c¯(t) L(0,T ).

j (t) = cj (t) - c¯(t) C0([0,T ]).

From (4.47) and (4.36), estimating the R.H.S of (4.46) and recalling (4.43) we have the differential inequality

(4.48)

yj (t)  K (1 + j(t))yj(t) + j(t) , yj(0) = 0, K > 0.

We use Perron's theorem 7 with the auxiliary problem

(4.49)

zj (t) = K (1 + j(t))zj(t) + j(t) , zj(0) = 0, K > 0.

Hence yj(t)  zj(t). Since j(t)  0 for j  , we have

(4.50)

zj(t)  w(t) as j  ,

where w(t) = 0 is the solution of

(4.51)

w = Kw, w(0) = 0.

Hence zj(t)  0 and yj(t)  0. This implies the continuity of the operator T . By the Schauder's fixed point theorem, problem (4.7)-(4.13) has a solution.

Remark. If we assume  = 0 > 0 and G = 0, 0 a constant, i.e. the case

physically more common, the derivative of the total energy E(t) is strictly negative

by (4.29). One could expect the temperature to tend to zero. This is not always

the case as the model adopted does not admit dissipation for the magnetic part of

the energy. Consider the following two-dimensional example. Let  = {(x, y); 1 <

7If y  g(t, y) and z = g(t, z) with y(0) = z(0) then y(t)  z(t).

The temperature does not tend to zero. Essential in this example is the fact that  is not simply connected.
