improved Genetic algorithm

Hongyuan Diao, Fuzhong Nian*, Xuelong Yu, Xirui Liu and Xinhao Liu

Abstract--Computational communication research on information has been prevalent in recent years, as people are progressively inquisitive in social behavior and public opinion. Nevertheless, it is of great significance to analyze the direction of predominant sentiment from the sentiment communication perspective. In this paper, the information emotion propagation model is established by introducing revamp genetic algorithms into information emotion. In the process of information dissemination, both the information emotions and the network emotions are dynamic. For this model, the information emotions and the network nodes emotions are quantified as binary codes. The convergence effects, crossover and mutation algorithms are introduced. These factors all act on the transmission process via dynamic propagation rate, and the improved genetic algorithm also acts on the emotion transmission. In particular, the latter two algorithms are different from the existing biological domain. Based on the existing research results in other manuscripts, we perform simulation described above on the hybrid network. The simulation results demonstrate that the trend approximate to the actual data. As a result, our work can prove that our proposed model is essentially consistent with the actual emotion transmission phenomenon.

I. Introduction
INFORMATION propagation is important research field in social networks [1-15]. Researching the spread phenomenon help us better understand the social. The early works are Barabási and Albert proposed the free scale [16], and Watts and Strogatz proposed the small world network model [17]. Then, the epidemiological models proposed, for example, the susceptible-infected model (SI model)[18], the susceptibleinfected-recovered model (SIR model) [19, 20] and susceptibleinfected-susceptible model (SIS model) [21, 22]. The classic DK model [23] adopts the stochastic process method to analyze rumors and divides the audience into three categories in accordance with the rumors pervasion: the ignorants, spreaders and stiflers. In addition, the three categories corresponding to the three populations in the SIR model [19, 24].
In recent years, domestic and foreign research in information emotion has distributed in many fields, such as journalism, sociology and computational communication. Research in multiple fields provides different perspectives on this issue. Such as, a new approach of genetic programming for music emotion classification is suggested [25]. Chen et al. studied about "storage and management strategy for heterogeneous data stream based on mutation information" [26]. The study is sentiment analysis in Twitter text [27]. The research is about "estimation of information via variation" [28]. An information theory method to study the effect of mutation on genetic algorithms is used [29]. The interaction between the volume of news and the intensity of emotions on emerging infectious diseases was studied by investigating Weibo data. Mainly rely on impulse response function for research [30]. Wang et al. proposed emotion-based independent cascade model of emotion communication [31]. Introduced a graphically coupled Hidden Markov Emotion Model to simulate and infer the spread of negative emotions of mobile phone users in social networks [32]. Zhang et al. studied that based on the Multiagent method, a nonlinear emergence model of the fragility of the social consensus system is established, and the evolution mechanism of the social consensus system for the spread of negative

emotions [33]. Some of the above researchers apply genetic algorithms [34-37] as a method of cogitation to research the transmutation in emotions, and others apply novel models to research the propagation of emotions. Nevertheless, those have not considered that the interaction between the information emotion and the vertexes emotion in the network. Among them, the carrier is not only include the information text, in essence the emotion in information is the main in the propagation. For example, few researchers employ the method to the emotion propagation. Our principal ideas are introduced emotion-related research based on the genetic algorithm, the influence of emotion propagation on the nodes and the nodes emotion on the propagation process are quantified. We synthesize the above viewpoints and establish the model of information and emotion propagation. So as to verify the rationality of the model better, it is selected that the polls collected by the Los Angeles Times during the "2016 US General Election" as the reference data. In accordance with the voting mechanism of public opinion surveys, our emotional propagation model is eventually manifested in the form of voting. The main contributions of this work are as follows. (1) we quantitate the emotion by the binary system code; (2) we improved the classical the genetic algorithm to drive the binary system emotion code iteration; (3) we introduced a new emotion spread model (SI'I model) according to the improved genetic algorithm; (4) simulation of voting in accordance with the "2016 US General Election".
The organization follows as: (1) in Section 2, the genetic algorithm of emotional coding is introduced in emotion propagation dynamic model. (2) In Section 3: The numerical simulation is finished. The data-driven simulation of single and multi-information is carried out based on the emotion propagation dynamic model.
II. MODEL DEFINITION
A. Review Stage Emotion Coding
The transformations of the information view(opinion) and node emotion always accompanied by that the information spread in network. In particular, the information view(opinion) of one event have different fragments in special time, so that the information fragment take the network different affect. The coupling phenomenon exist between different information fragments which born in the event development, e.g. the similar information fragments view(opinion) facilitate the spread each other and vice versa. In other words, if the node's emotion affected by the information fragment's view(opinion) after had received it, then the other similar view(opinion) of information fragments will influence the node more easily.
The mathematical model is explained from micro perspective, the node emotion will be influenced by how much gap the information fragment's view(opinion) and node emotion have, when the node receives an information fragment. In other words, people will have his own opinion when he knows a massage. After many information fragments spread in network one by one, the network's emotion also has changed many times. From micro perspective, the description about the model is that the network group's emotion gradually become different with beginning time, cause each node's emotion is influenced by network group's emotion and neighbor nodes' emotion.

Under the network topology, the users, the connection of

users and the weighted connections are abstractive defined as

respectively.

Additional, the network topology is signified as . = (!, ", %).

Equation (1) is defined as the total rounds 0 of spread,

0 = [0,1,  , 5]

(1)

where 5 indicates the round of spread. In the spread, the model sets that information fragments with different emotion totally have 7 pieces. Multiple information fragments form a complete event. Under network, information fragment 879:" totally spread 5#"$%! rounds in the period 0#"$%!. The specific definition is as follows:

0 = 0#"$%" + 0#"$%# +  + 0#"$%!.

(2)

Each period is accumulated. We get (3)

0 = >0#"$%", 1#"$%", 2#"$%",  , 5#"$%"?

+ >0#"$%#, 1#"$%#, 2#"$%#,  , 5#"$%# ? + 

+>0#"$%!, 1#"$%!, 2#"$%!,  , 5#"$%!?.

From (3), we get the complete constituting expression of time sequence, as follows:

The expressions of segmented timelines constitute the entire

timeline, as shown in (1), which is used to count that the effects

executing on the whole process, including the mutation

mechanism, the convergence effect and the mapping of the

entire process statistics described later. The segmented timeline

is defined as in (4), which is used to segment the executing time

of which effects in information propagation, and the (4) is

defined for the Emotional Similarity Evaluation Function

(ESWF) that will be introduced later.

When each node 8 spreads in time 5, the node emotion code

"_I:JK#(5) with L-bit M& (value 0 or 1) is defined as (6), m is an even number, and its Emotional Tendency Value (ETV) is

defined as (7), "#(5) represents the total number of 1 in "'%()#(5) code.

The information itself also has an emotion code

as (9), where "#"$%!(5) represents the number of 1 in

"'%()#"$%!(5) = [M*, M!,  , M&]

For instance

The influence of information will gradually decrease along with time in the process, expressed in the (10). Moreover, there are information fragments with different emotions alternately spreading.
Not only the information itself flows between nodes, but the influence of information emotion also exists on the emotion of receiving nodes in the process. The influence is quantitatively defined as the Emotional Similarity Evaluation Function (ESEF) shown in (10). The timeline in this function will use the segmented time expression in (5).

but the peak value of the opposite view is lower even if the

information ETV is close. The detail is analyzed in first part of

section 3.

The opinions from the people around us often influence our

judgment, sometimes those intimate friends, and sometimes the

opinions of the majority of the crowd. Abstract this

phenomenon into the network, the propagating nodes will also

be affected by the comprehensive emotion of the neighbors and

the average emotion of the network. We define them as the

neighbor affective coupling effect and the global affective coupling effect respectively, which are collectively called convergence effect. The higher the edge weight between nodes and their neighbors, the closer they are, the deeper their mutual influence, and vice versa. The definition of neighbor affective coupling effect is shown in (11).

1)-(#)(*) "")-(#)(5) × ##,")-(#) e(8, 5) =

h = IYiJa(Ki(8)b

(11)

Where ##,")- denotes the edge weight of node 8 and its neighbor node 7Ki, "")-(#)(5) is the ETV of node 8 's neighbor node 7Ki at time t. The numerator in right (11) represents the weighted sum of ETV of node 8 and its neighbor node 7Ki.
Node 8 has h = IYiJa(Ki(8)b neighbors. (Ki(8)(1) is the
first neighbors of node 8 in set (Ki(8) . Neighbor affective coupling effect e(8, 5) is the weighted average sum of ETVs of node 8 and its neighbor node 7Ki.
The node emotion will be affected by the global emotion, which is often called herding.
In simpler terms, when there are more and more people with the same emotion in the whole situation, the emotion of nodes may be shaken in the convergence direction. The definition of global affective coupling effect is shown in (12).

(12)

Where (WL+66 is the total number of nodes in the network, "#(5) is the emotional value of node i at time t, and the numerator of right equation represents the total emotional value
of all nodes at time t. The global affective coupling effect j(5) is the average emotion value of all nodes in the whole network at time t.
In order to clarify the system of dissemination, we introduce the ESEF and convergence effect (including neighbor affective coupling effect and global affective coupling effect) into dynamic spread rate, which is defined as (13).

ka"#(5), "#"$%!(5), 5 = 5#"$%!b = ca"#(5), "#"$%!(5), 5 = 5#"$%!b + e(8, 5) + j(5)

(13)

Where the three items on the right side are emotional similarity assessment function, neighbor affective coupling effect and global affective coupling effect. It means that node i has different propagation probability in different rounds of different information sources.
With the spread of multiple pieces of information with different emotion in the network, not only the state of nodes is changing, but also the emotional tendency of nodes for the whole information event is changing. So as to describe the transform of emotion, the Genetic algorithm is improved to the mutation algorithm and crossover algorithm.
Here, the emotion code "_I:JK#(5) of node i mutates with the probability of , in every round 5 of whole spread. In other word, emotional fluctuations occur in the whole process. In the

First Author et al.: Title

mutation emotion coding, the model randomly select the

mutation preselected segment, and then select the mutation

sample lM7m with , probability. If M7 = 1 in the sample, it will change to M7 = 0; if M7 = 0, it will change to M7 = 1. This process is called mutation algorithm:

Algorithm 1: MUTATION(n_opqr8(s), t).

Input: n_opqr8(s), t

Output: n_opqr8(s)

2: len = RANDOM(0, v)

if n_opqr8(s)[w] == 1 then

6:

Where the second row selects a random number between 0

and m, and the third row randomly selects a column number

between 0 and len with the probability of ,. The 7-th line adds

0 in the j-th position of the list "_I:JK#(5). After the information is received by a node, the node changes

the state, besides, the node emotion is affected by the

information emotion. By comparing the ETV of the node with

the ETV of the information, the emotional sequence of the node

copy the emotional sequence of the information source

unilaterally. The higher the ESEF is, the longer the copy

segment sequence is. When node 8 trigger crossover algorithm,

point J in the coding segment. If there is (J + Lc) < L, the

segment {M(~M(9&:} in "'%()#"$%!(5) is taken to cover the segment "'%()#"$%!(5) in "'%()#(5) . This process implementation is described as crossover algorithm, which is

the core for describing emotional swap.

B. Emotional Propagation Dynamic Model
A dynamic model of information emotional propagation is established, as shown in Fig.1. Consequently, from the perspective of emotional transmission, some people who have known information will forget the news, but not forget their own emotional attitude; and other people will discuss and exchange information with each other. The node has two states: the ignorant and spreader. The ignorant refers to the node that does not know the message, while the spreader is the node that knows the message and propagates the message. The spreader will broadcast the message to neighbor node, and the infected neighbor node will change into the spreader with the spread probability k. At this time, the spreader I will change into the ignorant S with the forgetting probability Ü, or into the spreader I` with the spread probability k again. This model is named as the SII`S model. In the SII`S model, emotion is crossed in according to crossover algorithm CROSSOVER(). Here, the spreader propagates information to the ignorant or the other spreader. In simpler terms, people who already know the news will communicate with anyone. When the spreader forgets the information and transfer to the ignorant, the ETV will not be forgotten or changed, but it still may occur mutation MUTATION(). The mutation algorithm MUTATION() appears in the whole process of propagation.

the more similar the two emotions are, and vice versa. The trend

the emotion, the less likely to be shaken; the more neutral the

idea is, the easier it is to accept various emotion, in other words,

it is easier to accept various emotions. The influence of any

news emotion will gradually decrease over time and eventually

dissipate. The curve on ï~0(c~5#"$%!) surface shows that in the round number stage of information infoC propagation, the ESEF of every two emotions will eventually decay to 0 with

time. To put it simply, the influence of information emotion is

dissipated. Therefore, the ï~0(c~5#"$%!) curve obeys the quasi linear distribution with the peaks of

B. Parameters Setup
In the mathematical simulation, the node NumDEE = 3000 and the number of propagation rounds T = 180. The number of information fragments n = 7. The propagation time of each information fragment is tBCFG" = 30 , tBCFG# = 54 , tBCFG' = 16tBCFG( = 20, tBCFG) = 19, tBCFG* = 8, tBCFG+ = 32. The ETV of all information segments are EBCFG"(t) = 21, EBCFG#(t) = 17, EBCFG'(t) = 1 , EBCFG((t) = 6 , EBCFG)(t) = 19 , EBCFG*(t) = 9 , EBCFG+(t) = 17 . The value of parameter m as the length of emotion code is 32. The parameters in (10) are d = 0.67,  = 15.7079,  = 0.05. The more detail shows in Table 1.

C. Single Information
Here we use one information fragment spread in whole process. Fig. 3 is the comprehensive analysis diagrams of emotional tendency value (ETV), when EBCFG(t) = 11. (a) is the stacked diagram of the accumulation of sentiment value over time. In Fig.3 (a), the horizontal axis is the propagation rounds T. When 5 = 0 , the number of nodes of each ETV follows a normal distribution. (Especially, very few people have extreme emotions.) The diagram is to stack the ETV sequentially. This graph obviously indicates the number of each ETV segmentation in any propagation rounds. From the perspective of ignoring the network topology, it only counts the number of emotionally segment values in the network. (b) is a schematic diagram of node sentiment value changes over time. In Fig.3 (b), it can intuitively indicate the transform of emotion tendency value of any node in the network during the whole process of propagation. The horizontal axis is the rounds T, and the vertical axis is the number of nodes where the total number (WL+66 = 600.

The number of emotions with high ESEF between the information ETV gradually increases D. Data-driven Multi-information
So as to verify the rationality of the model, it is selected as the reference data that the trend of the poll collected by the Los Angeles times during the "2016 US election". Based on the result of mathematical simulation, the information ETV is used to model the voting mode of public opinion poll. In the way of voting, the public opinion survey includes some vote abandoning behaviors. In order to optimize visualization, we reduce the value of "#(5) by 16. In simpler terms, when "#(5) = 16 ("#(5) = 32 before the down regulation) indicates extreme support for Trump and extreme opposition to Clinton, and "#(5) = -16 ( "#(5) = 0 before the down regulation) indicates extreme support for Clinton and extreme opposition to Trump. Among them, people with "#(5)  [1,16] ("#(5)  [17,32] before the down regulation) will definitely vote for Trump, and those with "#(5) = 0 ("#(5) = 16 before the down regulation) may vote for Trump or abandon their votes. People with "#(5)  [-16, -2] ( "#(5)  [0,14] before the down regulation) will definitely vote for Clinton, and those with "#(5) = -1 ("#(5) = 15 before the down regulation) may vote for Clinton or abandon their votes.

Combined with the analysis of the upper and lower figures in Fig. 4, the influence of public opinion on voting is not highly decisive at the beginning, and there be a small shock in the figure. In election type events, people tend to have stable views, because the choice is often related to their own benefits, public opinion has tiny influence on theirs' views. Therefore, the amplitude of the actual data is slightly smaller, about 0.7% to 0.01%. It can be seen from the lower figure that the trend of the simulated data is basically consistent with the real data, and the

Combining Fig. 4, it is clear that details of the emotional struggle between the two opposite positions.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this work, the information emotion propagation model is

established by introducing revamp genetic algorithms into

information emotion. We simulated the interactive

communication of information and emotions, and used various

forms to describe the simulation process. Furthermore, genetic

algorithms were used to analyze the particulars of the

propagation of emotions on the basis of binary genetic coding.

Finally, it presented the process model of emotion

communication and game in reality. The voting mechanism of

(a)

the "U.S. General Election Public Opinion Survey" was

established, and simulated voting accompanied by the

information and emotions propagation was conducted, and a

trend similar to actual data was obtained. Our results show that

the model is feasible. The controllability of emotional

communication is inseparable from the dynamic interaction

between groups and individuals, and it is essential for

understanding the spread of public opinion and emotion.

Fig. 6 is a comprehensive analysis diagram of emotion tendency value (ETV) in multiple emotional communication driven by real data. (a) is the stacked diagram of the accumulation of sentiment value over time. In Fig.6 (a), the horizontal axis is the propagation rounds T. When 5 = 0, the number of nodes of each ETV follows a normal distribution. (Especially, very few people have extreme emotions.) The diagram is to stack the ETV sequentially. This graph obviously indicates the number of each ETV segmentation in any propagation rounds. From the perspective of ignoring the network topology, it only counts the number of emotionally prominent segment values in the network. (b) is a schematic diagram of node sentiment value changes over time. In Fig. 6 (b), it can intuitively indicate the transform of emotion tendency value of any node in the network during the whole process of
