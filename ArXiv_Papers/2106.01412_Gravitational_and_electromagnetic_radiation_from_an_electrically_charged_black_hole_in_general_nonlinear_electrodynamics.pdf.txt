Abstract We derive the equations for the odd and even parity perturbations of coupled electromagnetic and gravitational fields of a black hole with an electric charge within the context of general nonlinear electrodynamics. The Lagrangian density is a generic function of the Lorentz invariant scalar quantities of the electromagnetic fields. We also include the Hodge dual of the electromagnetic field tensor and the cosmological constant in our calculations. For each type of parity, we reduce the system of Einstein field equations coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics to two Schro¨dinger-type wave equations, one for the gravitational field and one for the electromagnetic field.

1 Introduction
Penrose, in his Noble prize winning work [1], shows that when a massive star collapses to form a black hole, the singularity formation in general relativity (GR) is inevitable. This issue signals the demise of GR in its classical form. The singularity may be resolved by an ultimate quantum theory of gravity that can describe the final stage of gravitational collapse. In the absence of a microscopic theory, toy models of regular (singularity-free) black holes have been proposed to study the formation and evaporation of such black holes. After the first specific proposal for a regular black hole (RBH), which was presented by Bardeen in [2], many RBH models have been proposed by various authors over the years. See, for example, [3­16] for some of the RBHs that are asymptotically Schwarzschild at large radii. The majority of these black holes, including Bardeen's model, are constructed in an ad-hoc manner without an underlying theory behind them. However, in [17], Ay´onBeato and Garc´ia found the first regular black hole solution in GR that is coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED). NLED was originally proposed in [18], by Born and Infeld, in an attempt to generalize Maxwell's theory to strong field regimes. As a result, this theory provides a natural choice for studying charged black holes where we deal with strong electromagnetic and gravitational fields.
Ay´on-Beato and Garc´ia were also able to reinterpret Bardeen's model as a black hole with a nonlinear magnetic monopole charge in [19]. It was also shown by Rodrigues and Silva in [20] that the Bardeen solution can be obtained in NLED with an electric charge. In addition to the electrically charged black hole in [17], Ay´on-Beato and Garc´ia proposed two more black hole models with electric charge in [21] and [22].
For these RBH models to be viable, they need to be stable when they are perturbed. In addition to its relevance to gravitational wave observations, the study of black hole perturbations is crucial in determining the stability of a black hole model [23]. There are two approaches to study black hole perturbations. In one approach, the perturbation of a field (e.g. a scalar field), which is weakly coupled to the background of a black hole spacetime, is analyzed. In this case, the geometric perturbations are usually neglected. Since the equations governing the perturbations of spherically symmetric black holes are similar to the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar field, one can achieve a qualitative understanding of the black hole model and its perturbations. However, to achieve a quantitative understanding of the stability of a black hole, one needs to look at the perturbations of the spacetime and any strongly coupled fields to the background geometry.
The wave equations of coupled electromagnetic and gravitational fields of a black hole with a magnetic monopole charge in general NLED are derived for the first time by Nomura et al. in [24]. In addition to the electromagnetic field tensor Fµ, the authors of [24] include the Hodge dual of the field tensor, Fµ. The Lagrangian considered in [24] is a general function of the Lorentz invariant scalar quantities of the electromagnetic fields.
Since magnetic monopoles have never been observed in nature, in this paper we focus on electrically charged black holes within the context of NLED. We introduce perturbations on the background geometry of a charged black hole and its nonlinear electric field. We derive the odd parity (magnetic or axial) and even parity (electric or polar) wave equations for
2

the coupled electromagnetic and gravitational fields. As in [24], we also include the Hodge dual field tensor. Our work is similar to the work done by Zerilli in [25] for the ReissnerNordstr¨om black hole perturbations. For simplicity, in this work, we do not consider any test particle outside the black hole horizon. However, it should be easy to incorporate that using Zerilli's results in [25].
We structure the paper as follows. In Sec. 2, we set up the problem by deriving the perturbed Einstein-NLED equations. In Sec. 3, we expand the geometric and NLED perturbations in tensor harmonics and derive the wave equations, which are reduced to two coupled Schro¨dinger-type wave equations. In Sec. 4, we do the same steps taken in Sec. 3 for even parity perturbations. We provide the summery and conclusion in Sec. 5. In Appendix A, we explain some of the differences between our results, when reduced to the Reissner-Nordstr¨om case, and Zerilli's results in [25].

2 Perturbed Equations

In order to make the comparison with the Reissner-Nordstr¨om black hole perturbations easier, we closely follow the notation in [25]. The action of NLED in a curved spacetime is

The

Levi-Civita tensor is normalized as 0123 = -g. In this paper, we adopt Planck units

where c = G = = 1. The Einstein-NLED equations that describe the gravitational and

NLED fields are

G~µ = 8E~µ

where L~  L(F~, F~), L~F~  L~/F~, and L~F~  L~/F~. We use tilde for quantities associated with the total NLED and gravitational fields. Quantities with no tilde refer to the background geometry represented by the static spherically symmetric line element

ds2 = -edt2 + e-dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2).

We assume the following general ansatz for the Maxwell field for an electric charge

Fµ = 2[tµr]B(r, , )

(7)

from which we get F = 0. One then can integrate Eq. (5) to obtain

Fµ

=

2[tµ

r]

f (, ) r2LF

.

(8)

In the case of spherical symmetry, the invariant quantities F and F only depend on the radial coordinate. Consequently, both L and LF are functions of the radial coordinate only. Therefore, one can use the Bianchi identity, dF = 0, to show f (, ) is a constant that we will call -q. Therefore, the background field strength can be written as

F

q r2LF

dr.

(9)

In the rest of this paper, we choose

Q(r)

=

q LF

.

(10)

In the case of the Reissner-Nordstr¨om black hole, where LF = 1, q is simply the electric charge. In the RBH models presented in [17, 21, 22], q is also interpreted as the electric charge.
In the right-hand-side of Eq. (4), we have [24]

We introduce first-order perturbations g~µ = gµ + hµ and F~µ = Fµ + fµ assuming

F~ = F + F

to first order. The perturbed Einstein-NLED equations (14) and (15) reduce to the

Reissner-Nordsto¨m results in [25] when we choose L = F and  = 0.

where f¯µ denote angle-independent parts of fµ. The asterisk denotes the anti-symmetric components of the matrix.

As noted by Zerilli in [25], the odd parity geometric perturbations couple only to odd

parity electromagnetic perturbations and similarly for even parity perturbations. More

specifically, when we combine odd with even parity, the Einstein-Maxwell equations lead to f¯µ = 0. We find this to be true for the NLED case considered here. This, however, is not always true. In a black hole with a magnetic monopole charge, odd parity geometric

perturbations couple only to even parity electromagnetic perturbations and vice versa [24].

Since the electromagnetic field tensor F~µ is derived from a vector potential A~µ, where F~µ = A~,µ - A~µ, , we can write

fµ = a,µ - aµ, ,

(30)

6

where aµ is the perturbed vector potential. This is equivalent to having the field equations of the form fµ, + fµ, + f,µ = 0. These field equations lead to the following relations

Einstein equation, we find that

(35)

by the authors of [24], where they suggest a general form for L in which

L(F, F) = L0(F ) +

In the remainder of this section, we assume all field functions depend on time as e-it, where  is the quasinormal mode frequency of the perturbations. This is equivalent to a Fourier transform of the field functions where t  -i. We now look at the geometric perturbation equations (43-49). We use Eq. (49) to eliminate H2 in Eqs. (46-48). We then substitute rK and rH1, as given by these equations, into Eq. (44). This gives us an algebraic equation that involves H0, H1, K and the electromagnetic functions f¯01, f¯02, f¯12. We now solve this equation for H0 and substitute into Eqs. (46) and (47). Using Eqs. (50)

10

and (51), we replace f¯01 and f¯02 with f¯12, which we write in terms of fl(meven). This gives the following two equations

re-write Eqs. (55), (56), (65) and (66) in the matrix form

(70)

We now look for a transformation

(71)

where

F=

f (r) g(r) h(r) k(r)

(72)

is to be determined. Inserting Eq. (71) into (67) gives

n-1 ddr^(F ^) = AF ^ + S.

(73)

We can re-write the above equation as

d^ dr^

=

nF -1(AF

dF dr

nF -1S.

(74)

Comparing the above equation with Eq. (68) tells us that

nF -1(AF

dF dr

)

=

(75)

S^ = nF -1S.

(76)

Using the above equations, one can determine n(r), F , and consequently S^. The results for the components of the matrix F are

Also

n(r) = e,

(81)

which shows that the new variable r^ is just the tortoise coordinate r. Note that the functions f (r) and h(r) given in Eqs. (77) and (79) do not reduce to Zerilli's results in [25] for the Reissner-Nordstr¨om case. For an explanation, see Appendix A.

where 0, 0, 0, and 0 are the coefficients of 0 in the functions , , , and , given

in Eqs. (57-60), respectively. Note that to find V (even), one does not need to determine

the specific form of the function g. We can use Eq. (76) to determine S^1 and S^2. More

Comparing Eqs. (65) and (66) with (64), we get

It is also easy to combine Eqs. (65) and (71) to obtain

5 Summary and Conclusion
We studied the perturbations of the Einstein equation coupled to general NLED for a spherically symmetric black hole solution with electric charge. We also included the cosmological constant and the Hodge dual of the electromagnetic field strength tensor in our calculations. The NLED Lagrangian density is a generic function of the Lorentz invariant scalar quantities of the electromagnetic fields, i.e. F and F. The wave equations for odd and even parity perturbations of gravitational and NLED fields were derived. For each parity, we reduced the Einstein-NLED field equations to two coupled Schro¨dinger-type equations, one of which determines the gravitational and the other NLED field oscillations.
All our equations reduce to the correct results for the Reissner-Nordstr¨om case when we use Maxwell's Lagrangian density (L = F ) and take the cosmological constant  to be zero.

A Comparison with the Reissner-Nordstro¨m Results

There are multiple mistakes in Eqs. (22-24) of [25]. These mistake are also noticed by Pani

et al. in [27]. We provide the correct equations in (43-45). In addition, Eqs. (77) and (79)

The above two functions are different than the f (r) and h(r) provided by Zerilli in [25]. However, they are in agreement with the results provided in [27].
The mistakes in [25] appear to be typos, because Zerilli's final wave equations (Eqs. (48) and (49) of [25]) are in good agreement with Eqs. (87) and (88) when reduced to the

14

Reissner-Nordstr¨om case. It is important, however, to keep in mind that when Zerilli's wave equation for the even parity gravitational field (Eq. (48) of [25]) is used, to avoid obtaining wrong results, Zerilli's function f (r) should be replaced with the correct function provided in Eq. (89) above.
