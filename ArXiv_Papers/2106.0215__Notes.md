## Abstract

We generalize Brockett's necessary condition to the case of stabilizing general compact subsets having a nonzero Euler characteristic. Using this generalization, we also formulate a necessary condition for the existence of "safe" control laws. We illustrate the theory in concrete examples and for some general classes of systems including a broad class of nonholonomically constrained Lagrangian systems. We also show that, for the special case of stabilizing a point, the specialization of our general stabilizability test is stronger than Brockett's.
