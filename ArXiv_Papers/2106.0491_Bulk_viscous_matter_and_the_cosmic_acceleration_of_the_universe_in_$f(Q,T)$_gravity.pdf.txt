We studied bulk viscosity in the modified f (Q, T) gravity theory formalism, where Q represents the non-metricity and T denotes the trace of energy-momentum tensor within a flat Friedmann-Lema^itreRobertson-Walker metric (FLRW). We consider the effective equation of state, which includes a bulk viscosity term explicitly. We find the exact solutions relating to bulk viscosity by assuming a specific form of f (Q, T) = Q + T, where  and  are constants. Furthermore, we constrained our model with revised Hubble datasets consisting of 57 data points and newly published Pantheon samples with 1048 points to obtain the best fitting values of the model parameters. Our model is found to be in good agreement with observations. Furthermore, we analysed the cosmological behavior of the density parameter, the equation of state (EoS) parameter (), and the deceleration parameter (q). The universe appears to be evolving from a decelerated to an accelerated phase. The EoS parameter is further found to be in the quintessence phase, indicating that the universe is accelerating. We can deduce that the accumulation of bulk viscosity as effective dark energy is responsible for the current accelerated expansion of the universe.

I. INTRODUCTION
Observations of type Ia supernovae in recent years have suggested that the universe is expanding faster than usual [1, 2]. To understand the acceleration, physicists proposed a new fluid called dark energy, which has enough negative pressure. It is seemingly, seventy percent of the total content of the matter and energy in the universe. The straightforward way to explain dark energy is to introduce a cosmological constant, which leads to the claimed accelerated expansion and establishes the CDM model, which has proven to be accurate [3]. Even though observations favor the cosmological constant model, it has several serious flaws. The significant difference between its expected and observed value and the cosmic coincidence problem is that we live specifically in the universe whose matter density and dark energy density are of the same order. This motivates to study alternative models for accelerated expansion [4­6].
Since the advent of relativistic thermodynamics, viscous cosmological scenarios have been extensively stud-

ied. Eckart obtained the standard expression for relativistic viscosity in 1940 [7]. Furthermore, Treciokas and Ellis [8], and Weinberg [9] investigated the cosmological implications of the Eckart viscosity. The concept of bulk viscosity was later explored in the form of inflation [10, 11] and as a source for the rapid expansion of the universe [12]. Bulk viscosity, on the other hand, is measured in a homogeneous and isotropic background.
The bulk viscosity in a cosmic fluid can occur when the fluid expands faster than the system has time to recover its local thermodynamic equilibrium. An effective pressure emerges, restoring the system to its thermal stability [13]. This effective pressure can be regarded as an indicator of bulk viscosity. Perhaps, due to the presence of bulk viscosity, it is reasonable to assume that the expansion phase is simply a set of states out of thermal equilibrium in a limited fraction of time in an accelerated expanding universe [14]. There have been theories about viscous fluids playing a part in dark matter [15] and dark energy in the literature [16, 17].
Modified gravity has recently emerged as an influential branch of modern cosmology, seeking to provide a coherent explanation of the early epoch of the universe while also accounting for the accelerated expansion at later stages. Modified gravity theories are geometrical extensions of Einstein General Relativity (GR), in which Einstein-Hilbert action is altered to accomplish cosmic acceleration. Many modified gravity theories are sug-

2

gested to describe the late and early acceleration of the universe. The f (R) gravity proposed in [18], is the most basic and widely used modification to GR. Several authors have investigated several aspects of f (R) gravity and how it can cause cosmic inflation and acceleration [19, 20]. The existence of the non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry is another extension of Einstein-Hilbert's action. As a result, this leads to the so-called f (R, T) modified theory of gravity. Harko et al. [22] proposed f (R, T) gravity, in which the gravitational Lagrangian is described by an arbitrary function of Ricci scalar R and the trace of energy-momentum tensor T. There are astrophysical and cosmological implications investigated in f (R, T) gravity [21]. Harko [23] presented the thermodynamic interpretation of generalized gravity models with geometry-matter coupling. Jamil et al. [24] also reconstructed several cosmological models in f (R, T) theory. Moraes and Sahoo [25] proposed the modeling of static wormholes within the f (R, T) extended theory of gravity. Similarly, there exists several other modified theories with different cosmological implications such as f (G) theory [29­31], f (R, G) theory [32, 33], f (T, B) theory [34], etc. As it is known, the GR theory is formulated in Riemann geometry. So, another interesting approach for creating extended theories of gravity is to investigate more general geometric structures that could characterize the gravitational field at the solar system level. As a result, a more unified theory equivalent to GR has been developed known as a teleparallel equivalent to GR or f (T) theory [26­28], where T is the torsion defining the gravitational effects. The third generalization of GR is the symmetric teleparallel representation which is further extended to the non-metric gravity known as f (Q) gravity [35, 36], where Q is the non-metricity expressing the geometric variable defining the characteristics of the gravitational interaction. Studies on the cosmology of the f (Q) theory with observational constraints show the accelerated expansion of the universe without the requirement for exotic dark energy or additional fields [37, 38]. Mandal et al. [39] investigated energy conditions using a comparison of f (Q) theory and CDM. Khyllep et al. [40] examined cosmological solutions and the growth index of matter perturbations in f (Q) gravity. Yixin et al. [41, 42] have proposed a new extension of f (Q) known as the f (Q, T) theory, where the nonmetricity Q is non-minimally coupled with the trace T of the energy-momentum tensor. They focused on the three types of basic models and came up with solutions that described both the accelerating and decelerating evolutionary phases of the universe. Arora et al. [43] also tested f (Q, T) gravity models with observational

constraints to address the present cosmic acceleration. In Weyl-type f (Q, T) gravity, Yang et al. [44] derived the geodesic deviation and Raychaudhuri equations. Therefore, one can study the viability of this newly proposed f (Q, T) gravity under different cosmological implications.
However, several studies suggest that viscous pressure may be a driving force behind the current acceleration of the universe [45­47]. Davood [48] studied the effect of bulk viscosity matter in f (T) gravity. Singh and Kumar [49] investigated the role of bulk viscosity in f (R, T) gravity. Arora et al. [50] used an effective equation of state to investigate cosmological evolution with bulk viscosity in f (R, T) theory. This work aims to use the bulk viscous pressure inside the cosmic fluid without incorporating any dark energy element in the f (Q, T) modified theory of gravity to drive the current acceleration. We consider the bulk viscosity of the form  = 0 + 1 H, where H is the Hubble parameter, 0 and 1 are constants. The term 0 refers to the most basic parametrization of bulk viscosity, which is a constant and 1 refers to the possibility of a bulk viscosity proportional to the expansion rate of the universe. Also, the functional form of f (Q, T) = Q + T is assumed to get the exact solutions of field equations. We try to constrain the model parameters using the released 57 Hubble data points and 1048 Pantheon samples. To find the optimal values for the model parameters, we use MCMC techniques.
The following article is organized into sections. The field equation formalism in f (Q, T) gravity is presented in section II. In section III, we explain the FLRW universe dominated by bulk viscous matter and obtain the Hubble parameter expression. We used the revised 57 Hubble datasets and Pantheon samples to constrain the model parameters in section IV. We observed the behavior of cosmological parameters such as the density parameter, the EoS parameter, and the deceleration parameter in section V. Finally, in section VI, we discuss our conclusions.

The non-metricity tensor is represented by

(9)

Also, the variation of energy-momentum tensor with respect to the metric tensor is such that

 g µ Tµ  g

=

Tµ +  µ .

(10)

Thus, after varying the action (1) with respect to the metric and equating it to zero, we get the following field equations:

We assume the bulk viscosity coefficient as [51]

 = 0 + 1H,

(12)

where 0 and 1 are two constants, regarded as pos-

itive and

H

Here,

dot(·) represents the derivative

with respect to time. The reason for addressing this bulk

viscosity is since we know the transport viscosity phe-

nomenon are related to the velocity a, which is further

associated

with

the

expansion

.

Now, let us assume that the universe is described

by the homogeneous, isotropic and spatially flat FLRW

metric given by,

ds2 = -dt2 + a2(t)ijdxidxj.

(13)

where a(t) is the scale factor of the Universe. Moreover, assume that the cosmic fluid possesses a bulk viscosity. The energy-momentum tensor can be written as

Tµ = uµu + (p + )Hµ.

(14)

where in the co-moving coordinates, uµ = (1, 0), and Hµ = gµ + uµu. Also, the non-metricity function Q for such a metric is calculated as Q = 6H2. By defining the effective pressure as p~ = p + , the Einstein's field
equations using the metric and (11) are expressed as

(16)

Here (·)dot represents a derivative with respect to time,

besides F = fQ, and 8G = fT denote differentiation with respect to Q, and T, respectively.

The cold dark matter has been assumed to be highly

non-relativistic. So, we can take pressure p = 0 and

assume that the effect of dark energy on universe

evolution is included in the viscous term  = -

which has the dimension of pressure.

We assume the simplest functional form f (Q, T) = Q + T, where  and  are constants. Therefore, we get F = fQ =  and 8G = fT = .
Solving (15) and (16), we get the following differential equation.

H + k1 H + k2 H2 = 0.

(20)

where H(0) = H0, the present value of Hubble constant and C is an integrating constant. As the Hubble parameter contains model parameters 0, 1, , , and C, we try to constrain these with the two different datasets in the following section.

IV. OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS
We studied f (Q, T) gravity with the bulk viscosity formalism in the preceding sections and obtained an exact solution for the derived field equations. The solution contains four model parameters 0, 1, , , and a constant C. To validate our approach, we must constrain these model parameters with some observational datasets that will also yield the best fit values for these model parameters. In this study, we have considered two datasets: the observational Hubble datasets consisting of 57 data points and the newly released Pantheon samples with 1048 data points. To constrain the model parameters, firstly, we employed Python's scipy optimization approach and estimated the global minima for the Hubble function in equation (20). The considerable variances in the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix pertaining to the parameters are noticed. Then, we

used Python's emcee module for the numerical analysis and considered the above estimates as means and a Gaussian prior with a fixed  = 1.0 as the dispersion. As a result, we investigated the parameter space surrounding the local minima (or estimates). The method employed with two datasets is explored in greater detail below, with the findings displayed as two-dimensional contour plots with 1 -  and 2 -  errors.

mating the value of the H(z) at a specific redshift, two

approaches are extensively used. The extraction of H(z)

from the line-of-sight BAO data is one, while another

is the differential age methodology [55]-[73]. Here, we

use the revised set of 57 data points from the reference,

which includes 31 points from the differential age (DA)

approach and the left 26 points measured using BAO

and other methods of redshift range 0.07 z 2.42

[74]. In addition, we used H0 = 67.8 Km/s/Mpc for our analysis. We also used the chi-square function to find

the mean values of the model parameters 0, 1, , , and C (equivalent to the maximum likelihood analysis).

We obtained the best fit values of the model param-
eters 0, 1, , , and C as a two dimensional contour plots with 1 -  and 2 -  errors in fig. 3 using the
above stated Hubble datasets consisting of the 57 points
as tabulated in Table-1. The best fit obtained values are 0 = 10.8+-11..1100, 1 = 0.051+-00..001476,  = -1.69+-00..7540,

 = -9.38+-01..7370, and C = 7.66+-01..9150. In addition, we have observed the curve fit of the model with error bars
for the aforementioned Hubble datasets in fig 1 as well as our resulting model compared to the CDM model (with 0 = 0.7 and m0 = 0.3). Our model fits the observational Hubble datasets well, as shown in the plot.

B. Pantheon datasets
The pantheon sample, which contains 1048 data points, is the most recently released supernovae type Ia datasets. We used this sample [75] of spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia data points covering the redshift range 0.01 < z < 2.26. These data points give the estimation of the distance moduli µi = µiobs in the redshift range 0 < zi  1.41. We compare the theoretical µith value and observed µiobs value of the distance modulus to find the best fit for our model parameters of the derived model. The distance moduli are the logarithms µith = µ(DL) = m - M = 5 log10(DL) + µ0 where m and M denote apparent and absolute magnitudes, respectively, and µ0 = 5 log H0-1/Mpc + 25 is the marginalised nuisance parameter. The luminosity distance is considered to be

mentioned Pantheon datasets along with the error bars

The behavior of energy density  and effective pressure p~ is shown in plots 4 and 5. It is observed that

energy density is an increasing function of z, and the effective pressure is strongly negative. The negative pressure is due to the bulk viscosity considered, which

representing the quintessence phase whereas  below -1 is known as phantom regime. According to constrained values of model parameters 0, 1, ,  and C from Hubble data and Pantheon sample, the behavior of the EoS parameter is shown in fig. 7. It is observed that the EoS parameter remains in the quintessence phase supporting the acceleration in the universe. The present value of  is obtained as 0 = -0.86+-00..4612 and 0 = -0.90+-00..4719 [54] for Hubble data and Pantheon sample respectively.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
This article examined the evolution of the universe in the FLRW framework with the non-relativistic bulk viscous matter in modified f (Q, T) gravity theory. We have considered the bulk viscosity term as  = 0 + 1 H, where H is the Hubble parameter, 0 and 1 are constants. In the presence of bulk viscosity and assuming the function form f (Q, T) = Q + T, where  and  are constants, we obtained the exact solutions to field equations. The solution in the form of Hubble parameter contains 0, 1, ,  and C parameters. Further, we use 57 Hubble data points and 1048 Pantheon samples to constrain the model parameters 0, 1, ,  and C. As a result, MCMC techniques is used to find the best values for these model parameters. The best values are

Pantheon datasets:

0 = 11.0+-11..00  = -1.36+-00..8444 C = 7.4+-11..02

1 = 0.0504+-00..00059080  = -9.88+-01..7170

It is found that our model agrees well with the CDM model as shown in fig 1 and fig 2.
We investigated the behavior of cosmological parameters for the above best fit-values of model parameters. The density shows the increasing positive behavior, whereas effective pressure is highly negative due to the bulk viscosity. The deceleration parameter depicts a transition from positive in the past to negative in the present showing the current accelerated expansion of the universe. The present value of q is obtained as q0 = -0.55+-12..3522 and q0 = -0.64+-14..4857 for Hubble data and Pantheon samples respectively. The EoS parameter, on the other hand, is in the quintessence region, indicating that the universe is accelerating. We obtained 0 = -0.86+-00..4612 and 0 = -0.90+-00..4719 for Hubble data and Pantheon samples respectively. According to the obtained values of cosmological parameters and behavior, it can be said that the model considered here is stable and the bulk viscosity theory is a viable choice for describing the late-time acceleration of the universe in f (Q, T) gravity. This encourages us to investigate the cosmic implications and stability of the newly proposed f (Q, T) gravity in different aspects.

Hubble datasets:
0 = 10.8+-11..1100  = -1.69+-00..7540 C = 7.66+-01..9150

1 = 0.051+-00..001476  = -9.38+-01..7370
